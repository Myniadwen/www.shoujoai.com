Juri looked around her quite disapprovingly. The bar was deserted, the 
dance floor empty, and only one or two of the regulars were sitting at 
the tables for dinner. &#39;Where is everybody?&#39; she thought to herself 
somewhat worriedly.

Nabiki had a frown on her face as she walked over to Juri&#39;s side. &quot;If 
it stays like this,&quot; Juri&#39;s accountant sighed, &quot;we&#39;ll be closed in a 
month or so.&quot; She looked rather mournful as she said, &quot;It&#39;s too bad, I 
was starting to like it here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure things will pick up,&quot; Juri said, forcing herself to sound 
more confident than she really felt. She frowned, noticing something 
else was amiss.

Excel smiled sweetly to the young lady in front of her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I 
don&#39;t know how to make that. But we have some great beers!&quot; She 
delivered the last with an endearing perkiness that seemed to win the 
lady over. Beer in hand, she left.

&quot;What are you doing tending bar?&quot; Juri walked up to ask her with a 
frown on her face. &quot;And where&#39;s Ryouko and Minagi, anyway?&quot; she 
continued.

&quot;They asked Hyatt and I to watch the bar while they took their odd 
friend in back,&quot; Excel explained, pointing towards the pantry door. 
She blushed suddenly, putting her hand over her mouth as she blurted, 
&quot;I wasn&#39;t supposed to tell you that!&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t mention you told,&quot; Juri growled. A little frown, &quot;You said 
Hyatt&#39;s helping you, but where is she?&quot; Then Juri noticed Hyatt lying 
prone on the floor at Excel&#39;s feet, passing up beverages as necessary. 
With a sigh, Juri pushed the pantry door open and went in.

Minagi, Ryouko, Sasami and another figure were gathered to one side of 
the pantry, bent over a softly glowing object of some kind. Juri took 
a few steps into the room and instantly recognized the other woman 
there as Washu! &quot;What have you done to my bar?&quot; Juri demanded, quickly 
assuming the worst.

&quot;Don&#39;t interrupt a genius while she&#39;s working,&quot; Washu snapped back, 
then the little red headed scientist bent back to work. Minagi and the 
others looked at each other, silently debating who would get to 
explain to Juri.

&quot;If I don&#39;t get an explanation in five seconds,&quot; Juri said to them 
quite calmly, &quot;I&#39;m going to go get my sword. Understand?&quot;

Ryouko walked over to her and took her arm, teleporting them both out 
of the room and in front of the long bar on the other side of the 
wall. &quot;I&#39;ll explain everything,&quot; Ryouko said, leaping over the bar to 
pour out a stiff drink, &quot;once you drink this.&quot; She carefully 
sidestepped Hyatt and jumped back over to stand beside Juri,

&quot;Why...?&quot; Juri started to ask even as Ryouko slid the drink in front 
of her. She looked quite dubiously at the nearly clear fluid in the 
glass.

&quot;Because after hearing Washu&#39;s techno-babble I really needed to go 
have a drink,&quot; Ryouko wisely explained. Juri looked at her a moment 
before picking up her drink and then downing it all in one shot before 
visibly shuddering at the taste. &quot;Way to go!&quot; Ryouko congratulated her 
with a slap to the shoulder.

&quot;Now that I&#39;m sufficiently medicated,&quot; Juri said fiercely, &quot;what on 
Earth is that thing and what&#39;s it doing in my bar?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a variation on Washu&#39;s Time and Space device,&quot; Ryouko said, and 
had to suppress a smile at the panicked look that passed over Juri&#39;s 
face. She remembered Washu had activated it once while Juri was 
training at the shrine. &quot;It&#39;s a lot more harmless device than the 
original one,&quot; she rushed to reassure her.

&quot;I don&#39;t think any of Washu&#39;s inventions are harmless,&quot; Juri said 
dryly. &quot;So what does this variation do, exactly?&quot;

&quot;Putting it simply,&quot; Ryouko smiled a bit, &quot;it lets the bar exist 
across multiple dimensions, and allows people from those dimensions to 
visit the bar.&quot;

Juri&#39;s eyes went wide, &quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;ve been so crowded up until 
now?&quot; She sounded more than a bit disappointed that a machine had made 
the bar so popular.

&quot;The machine may have helped get them in the first time,&quot; Ryouko 
reassured her, &quot;but our service has been what&#39;s been keeping them 
coming back.&quot;

Juri smiled a bit, nodding as she said, &quot;Good point.&quot;

Minagi stuck her head out the pantry door, a smile on her face, &quot;Would 
you two mind coming in here?&quot;

Juri and Ryouko filed in, noticing the broad smiles on Minagi and 
Sasami&#39;s faces. &quot;It&#39;s fixed,&quot; Washu announced, and pressed a switch on 
the device&#39;s side. It flared brightly a moment, then dropped down to 
merge seamlessly with the pantry floor.

Juri tensed a bit, looking around a bit nervously. &quot;Nothing feels any 
different,&quot; she said a little nervously. She half expected something 
strange to happen.

&quot;Let&#39;s look at the bar, shall we,&quot; Ryouko drawled, leading the charge 
to the pantry door. She opened it and gentlemanly gestured the others 
out to the bar itself.

A bar that was rapidly filling up with people. Many third or even 
fourth time customers shouted their greetings to Juri and the others 
before taking their favorite places. Old and new friends cried out 
greetings to each other, and up at the long bar itself, poor Excel 
looked like she was going to be overwhelmed by drink requests.

&quot;Lets go,&quot; Minagi said calmly to Ryouko. The other woman nodded in 
reply and the two stepped up to rescue Excel and Hyatt from the 
thirsty mob.

Nabiki grinned, running up to Juri&#39;s side, &quot;Forget what I said 
earlier.&quot; She bolted off to recalculate her numbers, again.

May, Keiko, Excel and Hyatt worked to quickly get people to their 
tables while taking their orders for food and drink. The music started 
up, and the dance floor became a single mass of happily dancing women.

Hitomi smiled sunnily at Juri from the door before going back to her 
semi-official duties as the bar&#39;s greeter. Somehow, having a cute 
young woman at the door in her school uniform just seemed to give the 
place the right tone.

Juri looked around her domain with a small smile on her face before 
softly murmuring, &quot;Now that&#39;s more like it.&quot;

The Staff: The bar&#39;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Minagi, Ryouko, Washu and Sasami are from the series Tenchi 
Muyo. Keiko is also from Utena. Cyberdoll May is from Hand Maid May. 
Excel and Hyatt are from Excel Saga. Hitomi is from Escaflowne, the 
movie. And finally, Tendo Nabiki is from Ranma 1/2.
