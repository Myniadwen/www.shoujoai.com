        &quot;You know, I&#39;m kind of glad we decided to do a mixed ages 
party this year,&quot; Arisugawa Juri smiled slightly as Chibi-Usa and 
Hotaru ran by, laughing. Mixed among the adults children in costumes 
played, watched over by the staff and parents.

        &quot;I&#39;m still surprised that Setsuna talked you into wearing 
that costume,&quot; May smiled slightly, looking her boss over.

        The sailor senshi uniform that Juri was wearing was edged in 
orange, and she carried her Juraian energy blade as her primary 
weapon. She looked surprisingly authentic dressed up in the uniform, 
almost like some long lost member of that band.

        &quot;Setsuna had it made for me after she saw my Senshi 
counterpart a few weeks ago,&quot; Sailor Juri shrugged slightly, &quot;I 
really couldn&#39;t turn it down.&quot;

        &quot;Could be worse,&quot; Ryouko offered as she dropped off their 
drinks, Minagi dealing with customers up the bar, &quot;Ayeka threatened 
to come in her dominatrix outfit.&quot;

        Everybody sweatdropped at that idea.

        &quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; the quiet voice came from behind May, and the 
cyberdoll turned, her princess gown flowing around her. Keiko 
smiled, the sword she wore at her side glinting, her duelist&#39;s 
uniform crisp and neat. &quot;May I have this dance?&quot; she bowed formally.

        A happy blush marked May&#39;s face, &quot;You may, my knight.&quot; She 
took Keiko&#39;s hand, and the smaller woman led her lover out into the 
dancing crowd.

        A hand rested on Juri&#39;s arm, and she turned around to see an 
intense looking brown haired woman standing there. The suit that she 
wore was clearly expensive, but also comfortable, having been worn 
out quite often. The glasses she had on were square framed, suiting 
the intense look she gave Arisugawa Juri.

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Juri looked at her, wondering if the lady was going 
to be trouble.

        &quot;Are you the owner?&quot; she asked shortly.

        &quot;Arisugawa Juri,&quot; she answered. The woman did look sort of 
official, but she didn&#39;t have the style of a lawyer. &#39;So I&#39;m not 
being sued,&#39; Juri thought in relief, &#39;but what does she want?&#39;

        &quot;Sumiregawa Nenene,&quot; she woman grasped her small, book 
shaped locket and popped it open, revealing a very familiar looking 
photo that she showed to Juri. &quot;Have you seen this woman?&quot;

        &quot;Yomiko Readaman,&quot; Juri blinked in surprise.

        &quot;You know her! Has she been here recently?&quot; Nenene asked 
intensely, grabbing at Juri&#39;s arm and squeezing it firmly.

        &quot;Sumiregawa-san,&quot; a hand gently tugged on Nenene&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;ease off a little bit, please.&quot; Standing just behind 
Nenene was one of the tallest women Juri had ever seen, standing 
well over six feet tall. A quick look confirmed she wasn&#39;t wearing 
any heels, either.

        Nenene hesitated, then offered the tall woman a 
smile, &quot;Thanks, Maggie.&quot; The woman blushed cutely as Nenene turned 
back to Juri, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve been looking for her 
for such a long time.&quot; A sad smile, &quot;Has she been here recently?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, but...&quot; Juri hated to disappoint the woman, &quot;she isn&#39;t 
really a regular here. She comes here every now and then, but not 
terribly regularly.&quot;

        &quot;At least she&#39;s all right,&quot; Nenene murmured softly, looking 
at the photo herself. Quietly she asked, &quot;Do you think she&#39;s happy?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Juri answered, deciding not to mention Yomiko&#39;s 
girlfriend Nancy. Somehow, she didn&#39;t think it would be a good idea.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Nenene smiled. She shook herself, taking in the 
costume party all around them. Catgirls, cross-dressers, ghouls, 
goblins, maidens and dozens of others paraded through the crowd. She 
smirked as she took in Juri&#39;s suit, &quot;Nice costume.&quot;

        &quot;Girlfriend talked me into it,&quot; Juri shrugged, knowing she&#39;d 
probably be giving that explanation a lot tonight.

        &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll stick around, see if she turns up,&quot; Nenene 
murmured.

        &quot;I&#39;ll get a table,&quot; Maggie said simply as she lead Nenene 
over to a seat, protecting the smaller woman with her body.

        &quot;A bodyguard, I think,&quot; Setsuna came up to take Juri&#39;s arm. 
She was dressed in a military style uniform, much like the generals 
of the Moon Kingdom had worn. It suited her, though in Juri&#39;s eyes 
Setsuna could be wearing a sack and it would look good.

        &quot;Maybe so,&quot; Juri agreed, gently kissing her lover 
hello, &quot;but I think that there&#39;s something more than that there.&quot; A 
smile, &quot;You should have seen the tall one, Maggie, blush when Nenene 
talked to her.&quot;

        &quot;Maggie-chan!&quot; a green haired girl looked around worriedly.

        Beside her a little red headed girl looked around with a 
scowl, &quot;This sucks.&quot;

        The two spotted their other friends and then rushed to their 
side, making an odd foursome. Of course, once the green haired girl 
spotted the Locket&#39;s library she bounded over to it happily, while 
Maggie looked rather tempted by the books. By a supreme act of will 
she stayed by Nenene&#39;s side, watching over her protectively.

        Up on the kareoke stage, two women dressed up as vampires 
were singing, though it was pretty clear that under the makeup it 
was Nabiki and Ayeka Kisaragi. The danced and sang with passion, 
shooting each other seductive glances,

        &quot;We&#39;re dancing with a demon,
        while the city&#39;s dreaming
        you can hear his laughter,
        you know what he&#39;s after...&quot;

        The crowd cheered, especially after an errant move caused 
Nabiki to flash the crowd her pure white panties. &quot;Oops,&quot; Ayeka 
blushed fiercely, the gorgeous redhead&#39;s fair skin making the blush 
very obvious.

        &quot;You&#39;re going to pay for that one later,&quot; Nabiki flashed her 
fangs, her dark hair falling rakishly around her face.

        &quot;I&#39;ll be looking forward to it Mistress,&quot; Ayeka leaned 
forward, her voice dropping down to a sexy purr and Nabiki blushed 
furiously.

        Noin paused out in the cold to give Bones a look, &quot;Have you 
considered my offer to join the Preventers?&quot; The black haired 
officer adjusted her dress uniform&#39;s tie, noting that while it 
wasn&#39;t really a costume, it would probably do.

        &quot;No,&quot; Bones&#39; voice came out a bit muffled through the ninja 
costume she was wearing. She almost disappeared into the shadows as 
she nodded to the evening gown garbed woman standing by Noin, &quot;It&#39;s 
good to see you, Miss Releena.&quot;

        &quot;And you, Bones,&quot; the brown haired smiled as they swept by 
her. Walking the hall inside Releena gave Noin a scolding 
look, &quot;Don&#39;t try to poach Arisugawa&#39;s staff, it&#39;s rude.&quot;

        &quot;Besides which,&quot; Hitomi grinned, the catgirl costume she 
wore making her look like an oversized gray kitten, &quot;none of us 
would work anywhere else.&quot;

        &quot;You look adorable,&quot; Releena squealed.

        &quot;She&#39;s been getting that all night,&quot; Milerna agreed. Dressed 
in a pirate&#39;s outfit, eyepatch and all, she looked quite believable. 
In her fingers she twirled one of her knives, a non-verbal warning 
of &#39;Hands off my girlfriend!&#39;

        Subaru smiled happily as her companion pushed the wheelchair 
into place by the table. &quot;Tsubasa, when you suggested this I thought 
it was crazy,&quot; she laughed.

        The wavemaster smiled at her slightly, handling her paper-
mache staff carefully. &quot;I thought it might be kind of fun doing this 
looking like we did back in the World,&quot; Tsubasa said with a little 
shrug. Her clothing and look was quite boyish, but still clearly 
feminine as she pulled out a chair over to sit beside Subaru.

        Subaru looked over at her fondly, &quot;You know, I think you 
look even more handsome than you did in the World.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Tsubasa murmured, her cheeks glowing red.

        &quot;I love when you do that,&quot; Subaru murmured, bending forward 
in her chair to gently press her lips to Tsubasa&#39;s cheek, smearing 
the paint in the process.

        &quot;That is so cute,&quot; Hyatt agreed, looking quite odd dressed 
in Excel&#39;s regular uniform.

        &quot;You can say that again,&quot; Excel agreed, carefully adjusting 
Hyatt&#39;s uniform which was slightly larger in the bust area.

        &quot;That is so....&quot; Hyatt started to repeat before she 
collapsed, Excel quickly catching her, then snuggling close to her 
fainting lover.
