<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 9 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        Sailor Saturn hefted the Silence Glave, gazing across the 
arena thoughtfully. Her short black hair blew gently in the artificial 
breeze, her Senshi uniform crisp and neat. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; she asked 
her opponent softly.

        Tenjou Utena smiled slightly in return, raising the Sword of 
Dios. She carefully brushed her long pink hair back, her black and 
rose military style uniform making her seem to fade into the shadows. 
&quot;Always,&quot; was her simple answer.

        They charged without any warning, their weapons crashing 
together loudly. &quot;Silence Wave,&quot; Sailor Saturn cried and power surged 
from her weapon. But Utena merely braced herself, using her blade to 
turn that power aside.

        &quot;Revolution Sword!&quot; Utena cried out, and her sword was etched 
in white fire as she struck.

        Sailor Saturn blocked the attack with a hasty, &quot;Silence Wall!&quot; 
She looked a bit startled as she softly said, &quot;A new trick?&quot;

        &quot;Something I picked up,&quot; Utena said with a casual smile.

        &quot;Incredible,&quot; Erica murmured as the dark haired girl watched 
them from the safety of the observation room built into the wall of 
the arena. When Aunt Minako had mentioned that Utena was here visiting 
the palace she had asked if it would be possible to see her. Erica 
hadn&#39;t really been expecting to see her in battle, though.

        &quot;That they are,&quot; Minako admitted. &quot;They do this every time 
Utena visits, supposedly because of a feud years back.&quot; The blonde 
smirked, &quot;Personally, I just think it&#39;s because they&#39;re the only ones 
who can give the other a good fight.&quot;

        &quot;Ouch,&quot; Erica winced as the two women hammered on each other. 
She looked down, trying to get a better look and blinked in honest 
surprise, &quot;They&#39;re both smiling.&quot;

        &quot;See what I mean?&quot; Minako grinned.

        Back and forth across the arena they went, each searching for 
any sign of weakness in the other. They seemed very evenly matched, 
shimmering with power as they tested their abilities against a worthy 
opponent.

        Suddenly a red rose struck into the floor between the two 
women. From the shadows, the dark skinned woman with purple hair 
appeared, dressed in a costume like Utena&#39;s but colored pink and edged 
in black.

        &quot;Anthy,&quot; Erica looked down from the booth and recognized her 
from the histories.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Minako agreed, &quot;but in that uniform she&#39;s also called 
Bara no Senshi.&quot;

        &quot;Soldier of Roses,&quot; Erica translated.

        &quot;I hate to interrupt your play,&quot; Anthy smiled, &quot;but Utena and 
I need to go see Neo-Queen Serenity later, and I&#39;d like to make sure 
we look reasonably good.&quot;

        &quot;Perfectly understandable,&quot; Hotaru smiled. She nodded to Utena 
and added, &quot;We can always take this up again later on.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll be looking forward to it,&quot; Utena grinned as Anthy lead 
her out.

        Up in the observation room Minako smiled at Erica, &quot;If you 
want, go talk to Hotaru. I&#39;m certain she wouldn&#39;t mind arranging for a 
introduction.&quot;

        Erica blushed, a bit embarrassed at being so transparent, 
&quot;I&#39;ll do that.&quot; She looked up at Minako curiously, &quot;Will we see you at 
dinner?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Minako smiled, &quot;I just have some things to take care of 
first.&quot;

        With that they separated, and Minako continued on to her 
offices. She keyed the door open and went inside, closing it firmly 
behind her before she sat down behind her desk. She patiently dealt 
with some of her paperwork, killing a bit of time.

        &quot;Good afternoon, Lady Venus,&quot; the woman seemed almost to 
appear from nowhere, her short brown hair swept back from her face. 
Dark brown eyes and black leather completed the look, a tough and very 
dangerous young woman.

        &quot;Hello Major Kusanagi,&quot; Minako answered calmly.

        Everyone knew that Lady Venus was the head of Neo-Queen 
Serenity&#39;s diplomatic corps as well as it&#39;s head diplomat. What very 
few people knew was that she was also the head of the intelligence 
division, running a tight organization of operatives throughout known 
space.

        And Major Motoko Kusanagi was her lead agent and right hand 
woman, over seeing much of the agency&#39;s covert operations. A survivor 
of the crazy years in the late 21st century, the artificial 
intelligence that she had evolved into had seen almost everything, and 
could handle it with style.

        Taking a seat Motoko reached into her jacket to remove a data 
slide, &quot;Here&#39;s our latest report, and I&#39;ve highlighted key information 
you might want to give the Queen.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Minako took the slim recording device before 
asking her, &quot;could you give me a brief summary?&quot;

        &quot;Sure,&quot; Motoko smiled. &quot;Locally, we seem to be doing well. Our 
allied colonies are happy, and while there&#39;s some corporate mischief 
going on I&#39;ve got people on it.&quot; Her expression grew more serious, 
&quot;But many nearby non- allied planetary systems are starting to arm 
themselves.&quot;

        Minako sighed, &quot;We were almost expecting that. With us on one 
side and Jurai&#39;s fleet on the other, they had to be feeling nervous.&quot;

        &quot;The problem is someone is selling them arms from the 
outside,&quot; Motoko said softly.

        Minako&#39;s eyes narrowed, &quot;Earth tech?&quot;

        &quot;Thankfully, no,&quot; Motoko smiled slightly, &quot;but it is Jurai 
military tech. We&#39;re still tracing it back discretely, but I think a 
Lord has decided to line his pockets a bit.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s in your report?&quot; Minako confirmed. At Mokoto&#39;s nod she 
said, &quot;Then I&#39;ll pass an edited version to the Jurai ambassador, as 
well as asking Serenity to informally let Tenchi know.&quot;

        &quot;Many Jurai nobles are also getting a bit nervous about us,&quot; 
Motoko added.

        &quot;What have I told you about spying on our allies?&quot; Minako 
scolded her gently. Motoko just grinned and she asked, &quot;Why are they 
nervous?&quot;

        &quot;The shield configurations on out latest ship classes,&quot; Motoko 
said simply. &quot;When Jurai lent warships to shoot at them, they expected 
to punch right through our shields. Instead, the new designs held off 
everything they could throw at them.&quot;

        &quot;They know we&#39;ve never had an expansionist military policy,&quot; 
Minako said with a sigh, &quot;and that our fleet is intended for defense 
only.&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t be naive,&quot; Motoko scolded her gently, &quot;the nobles of 
Jurai know that Tenchi won&#39;t be around forever. We are the only 
military power right now that could hold our own against Jurai, so if 
they ever want to be expansionist again they have to deal with us.&quot;

        &quot;So does the war party among the nobles have enough pull to be 
a problem?&quot; Minako asked her softly.

        &quot;Not yet,&quot; Motoko answered, &quot;but I&#39;m keeping an eye on them.&quot; 
She got up from her chair, &quot;Those are all the highpoints. I&#39;d better 
go before we&#39;re seen together, ma&#39;am.&quot;

        &quot;Are you staying around the Palace for awhile?&quot; Minako quickly 
asked. &quot;I don&#39;t get to talk with you socially very often.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll wear a different body,&quot; Motoko smiled slightly, &quot;see you 
later.&quot; With that, her skin went pale, and she simply disappeared.
