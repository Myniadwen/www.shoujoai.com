Priss, the relief bouncer, looked at the two young men rather 
distainfully. Mr Morden held up a small slip of paper, pleading, &quot;But 
we&#39;ve got invitations and everything!&quot; Shane hid just behind him to 
protect himself from the tough looking lady. In the background, the 
Akio-car sits, it&#39;s engine softly purring it&#39;s contentment.

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; Priss pointed out to them calmly, &quot;this is a ladies 
bar, understand?&quot; She gave them a glare, and they took a involuntary 
step backwards.

Realizing they were not getting by her, they sighed sadly, and took 
off to drown their sorrows elsewhere. Meanwhile, inside the bar...

Sylvie looked at Minagi with a look of honest surprise on her face. 
&quot;You&#39;ve got EX?!&quot; she squeaked out happily.

Minagi handed her the requested can of beer with a small chuckle. 
Sylvie looked at it with a grin before chugging it in one smooth 
gesture. &quot;We carry a wide variety of drinks, too,&quot; Minagi said with a 
smile.

Sylvie gets a bit teary eyed, her lower lip quivering, &quot;But I like my 
EX!&quot; Minagi just sighed softly in reply, noticing the odd looks they 
were getting. Ryouko stood against the other side of the counter, 
laughing softly.

Juri walked by one table, where Umi and Fuu sat looking remarkably 
irritated about something. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Juri asked them with a 
frown. If there was a problem with the club, Juri wanted to know 
imediately.

Umi scowled and pointed out onto the dance floor instead of answering 
aloud. Juri looked at the crowd of dancing young women with a frown, 
then she saw what Umi was pointing at. Juri smirked slightly, getting 
a glare from both seated young ladies.

Connie and Hikaru broke from the crowd, dancing closely together. 
Connie kept a firm grip on the cutie, looking quite obvious in her 
intent not to let her go for the rest of the evening. Juri gave the 
two remaining Magic Knights a shrug before heading off.

Juri smiled, looking over her special guests with a bit of amusement. 
The young women all looked like they were having a good time. She 
looked a bit concerned when she noticed a tall woman cutting through 
the crowd towards one of the guests.

Roxanna looked up from her drink, her eyes widening. The blonde looked 
down at her with distain, her eyes filled with arrogant pride. She 
looked much like a huntress who had just discovered her very favorite 
prey.

Goldie slid a finger under Roxanna&#39;s chin, pushing her face up so that 
their eyes met. &quot;I understand you&#39;ve been writting stories about me,&quot; 
she said in a dangerous purr.

Roxanna had a &#39;deer in the headlights&#39; look on her face. She opened 
her mouth to say something in her own defence, but Goldie gently 
pushed her mouth closed. She tugged Roxanna up to her feet, putting 
them face to face and making Roxanna drop her strawberry daiquiri.

Her lips brushed Roxanna&#39;s ear as she whispered, &quot;Upstairs, room 
number three.&quot; She turned and walked to the stairs, her body swaying 
sexily. Roxanna stood there in stuned shock a moment, before 
scrambling after her.

Juri sighed in relief, watching them go. She just hoped Roxanna knew 
what she might be getting into, going off with that dangerous lady. 
She noticed a woman sitting in a corner, drinking quietly and watchig 
the goings on. Juri made her way through the crowd, pulled out a 
chair, and sat down beside her.

&quot;Nice to see you, Rehanna,&quot; Juri said a bit nervously.

Rehanna raised her glass with a friendly smile, and Juri instantly 
felt a bit better. &quot;We&#39;ve missed you over at the Miko,&quot; she chided 
Juri gently.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Juri said with a little shrug, looking around her, &quot;I&#39;ve been 
a bit busy lately.&quot; She gestured, and May came over to take her order. 
&quot;One of my specials, please,&quot; Juri said.

May came back, put Juri&#39;s drink down as well as a refill in front of 
Rehanna. &quot;But I didn&#39;t order,&quot; Rehanna started.

May bowed, smiling at her sweetly, &quot;Compliments of the house.&quot; Before 
she could say anything else, another table asked for a refill. 
&quot;Coming!&quot; she cried, and jogged off.

Rehana smilied thankfully at Juri, and they clinked their glasses 
together in a toast. &quot;I&#39;m not surprised you&#39;re busy,&quot; Rehanna 
commented knowingly. She looked at Juri thoughtfully, &quot;I never really 
saw you as the nightclub type. I was wondering, why did you...&quot; she 
trailed off, and looked around the bar.

&quot;It&#39;s a bit of a long story,&quot; Juri said with a little smile. Rehana 
looked at her curiously, so she cleared her throat, took a sip of her 
ginger ale, and started...

&quot;I guess it all began with my Aunt. She was an incredible business 
woman, knowing when to invest and when to sit on her money. By the 
time she was twenty, she had made her first million, but it wouldn&#39;t 
be her last.&quot; Juri chuckled softly, &quot;As you can imagine, my family 
spent much of their time trying to suck up to the old lady.&quot;

She took a sip, &quot;But as much as they may have admired her wealth, they 
just as strongly disapproved of her personal life. You see, she had 
lived for years with a longtime companion of the female variety. 
Anyway, she held the family in a great deal of contempt for their 
hypocracy.&quot;

&quot;Personally, I never joined in the attempts to butter the old lady up. 
I went about my life, and when I turned twenty one, I came out of the 
closet. A day later, and I was officially kicked out of the house.&quot;

&quot;My Aunt was furious at my father, not to mention quite devious, and 
she rewrote her will soon after. A few years later she died, and the 
family gathered like circling vultures for the reading of the will.&quot; 
She smiles slightly, &quot;They nearly died when they found out my Aunt 
left all her money to me and her companion, with some stipulations.&quot;

&quot;Stipulations?&quot; Rehanna echoed.

&quot;I had to be very much &#39;out of the closet&#39; to inherit, and in a way 
that highlighted my identity. Hence the name of this little club,&quot; she 
laughed. &quot;Not something my dear old dad can sweep under the rug,&quot;

&quot;So you did this just to inherit the money?&quot; Rehanna asked, sounding 
just a little disapointed with Juri.

Juri shook her head, &quot;Maybe in the beginning.&quot; She smiles, &quot;I&#39;ve found 
that I really enjoy this, running a nightclub and making a place where 
my friends can come to and be themselves safely, no matter what.&quot;

Rehanna nodded thoughfully, &quot;You do look like you&#39;re happy.&quot; She got 
up, smiling down at Juri, &quot;I hope we&#39;ll see you at the Miko 
occasionally, though.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Juri said, giving her a sketchy salute.

Our Cast This Episode: Mr Morden, Sylvie, Connie, Roxanna and Rehanna 
are all real people whom the Author, Shane, talks with online! Priss 
is from Bubblegum Crisis, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu are from Magic Knight 
Rayearth, and Goldie is from Gunsmith Cats.

The Staff: The bar&#39;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Minagi, Ryouko and Sasami are from the series Tenchi Muyo. 
Keiko is also from Utena. Cyberdoll May is from Hand Maid May. Excel 
and Hyatt are from Excel Saga. Hitomi is from Escaflowne, the movie. 
And finally, Tendo Nabiki is from Ranma 1/2.

Author&#39;s Notes: Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t plan on having real people in 
these stories very often. &quot;The Miko&quot; that Rehanna and Juri both 
mention is &quot;The Drunken Miko&quot; a series of online episode stories 
Rehanna has written, often featuring real people in cameos, myself 
included. They appear semi- regularly on the Blood Soaked and Honor 
Bound Yahoo Group, and are quite entertaining. Mr Morden, Sylvie and 
Connie all post on that group as well. Roxanna Ohtori, the leader of 
the Insanity Brigade Yahoo Group, is a author of darky erotic Utena, 
Sailor Moon, and recently, Gunsmith Cats fics. She rather likes 
Goldie, so...

PS. Alexander is the name of the scientist in &quot;Ceres&quot; that has blond 
hair and spectacles. While I don&#39;t like his hair color, I like the way
