<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 14 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>        It had been called many things, down through the years. It 
was Veteran&#39;s Day, Memorial Day, Remembrance day and a dozen other 
names, more coming to it as the centuries went past. Eventually it 
was simply called Memory, a day of contemplation, where those who 
had lived on remembered those who had passed away.

        And it was a day of parties.

        Glasses or wine, whisky, synth-ale, scumble and many more 
beverages were raised up in honor of all those long lost friends. 
Clubs and restaurants across the city were packed as the Memory day 
went on, and personal celebrations were held with families and 
friends.

        The great dining room of the Palace of Crystal Tokyo was 
slowly filling as all the guests arrived, the ten Senshi warmly 
greeting their old friends. The duelists arrived first, the siblings 
Touga and Nanami Kiryuu, Miki Kaoru, Kyouichi Saionji, Arisugawa 
Juri and finally Utena and Anthy Tenjou. Minagi and Sasami of Jurai, 
Kinomoto Sakura, her bride Tomoyo and Kero, Priss, Urd, Linna, 
Belldandy, Sylia, Mara and Skuld, Major Motoko Kusanagi there by 
invitation of the Lady Venus, and a few other notables.

        And among them was a blue haired girl who looked remarkably 
pale as she looked in awe at the legends that surrounded her. 
Catrine gulped nervously, making sure that her formal dress was 
straight. &#39;I can&#39;t believe that my family was invited,&#39; she 
thought, &#39;I guess we really are descended from the queen&#39;s friend 
Naru.&#39;

        &quot;Good to see you, love,&quot; Setsuna paused to gently kiss 
Arisugawa Juri on the cheek. Softly, &quot;I was worried you were going 
to spend the day at the Locket.&quot;

        &quot;I was tempted,&quot; Juri admitted as she slipped her arm around 
Setsuna&#39;s waist, &quot;But I didn&#39;t want to leave you alone.&quot;

        On the far side of the hall the main doors opened up, and 
four figures stepped inside. Neo- Queen Serenity was beautiful as 
always, her long, almost white gold hair gleaming as her husband led 
her white clad form inside. King Endymion looked handsome in his 
black suit, his dark purple hair looking even darker because of it.

        Walking in just behind them the Princess Usagi looked lovely 
dressed in her own pure white gown, her long pink hair flowing down 
her back in two tails. As always right beside her the princess-
consort stood, Hotaru, or Lady Saturn. Wearing a dark colored suit 
she cut a striking figure with her dark hair and pale skin.

        &quot;Welcome, my friends,&quot; Neo-Queen Serenity&#39;s voice rang out 
across the room. She smiled slightly, &quot;In this room, for today, I am 
merely Usagi Tsukino once again, in memory of those that have passed 
on.&quot;

        &quot;Guess I&#39;m stuck with Chibi-Usa again,&quot; the Princess stage 
whispered to Hotaru, bringing a bit of levity to the situation.

        &quot;It&#39;s only a day,&quot; Hotaru kept her voice entirely deadpan, 
but a smile teased at her lips &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll manage.&quot;

        They rook their seats, everyone moving to a place. The 
Senshi and Duelists were all broken up among their guests, though 
couples were sitting together. The Queen raised up her glass in the 
traditional first toast, &quot;To absent friends.&quot;

        &quot;Absent friends,&quot; the voices rang back.

        &quot;Watch the hands,&quot; Priss muttered as Urd slid a hand up her 
thigh.

        &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Urd grinned at her lover, making her blush.

        Catrine looked around the table nervously, then the teen&#39;s 
eyes widened slightly as she saw a familiar face just up the table. 
Erica Tenoh, her classmate, was sitting there, comfortably talking 
away to the Guardian Beast Keroberos as if she did so every day.

        &quot;At least I&#39;m not a little kid anymore,&quot; Erica commented as 
she cut her dinner, putting a bit of meat into her mouth, &quot;I seem to 
remember thinking you were a stuffed toy when we first met.&quot;

        Kero chuckled softly, the little Guardian Beast eating his 
favorite foods: cookies and cake. &quot;Hell of a grip too,&quot; he 
remembered, &quot;I&#39;m glad Haruka finally pried you loose.&quot;

        &quot;Knowing her,&quot; Erica smirked, &quot;she probably took her time 
getting me off you.&quot;

        &quot;Probably,&quot; Kero agreed with a laugh. He paused, and dropped 
his voice, &quot;There&#39;s a lady watching you, couple of plates over.&quot;

        Erica looked with the corner of her eye, then 
paled. &quot;Catrine,&quot; she said weakly. Softly she muttered, &quot;I should 
have checked the invitation lists...&quot;

        &quot;Friend of yours?&quot; Kero asked curiously.

        &quot;Classmate,&quot; Erica sighed, &quot;she doesn&#39;t know that I&#39;m 
related to the Senshi.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;Well, she used to not 
know.&quot;

        &quot;Guess I can&#39;t blame you for trying to keep a low profile,&quot; 
Kero admitted. He looked over at her curiously, &quot;What are you going 
to do?&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Erica answered softly.

        The queen rose from her chair, raising up her glass 
again. &quot;To the Tsukino family,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I wish I had 
valued you as much as you deserved back then.&quot;

        Each person around the table rose, speaking a toast to one 
now gone. Some were expected, like Lady Mars tribute to her 
grandfather, others less so. Both Venus and Jupiter spoke of Natsuna 
and Haruna, the sisters that had once held their hearts. Motoko 
mentioned Yayoi, regret in her voice. Anthy mentioned Dios, not 
Akio. All around the table they went, finishing up at the head of 
the table once again. Once the meal was finished, they rose up to 
circulate once again.

        &quot;Thank you for inviting me,&quot; Mokoto murmured to Lady Venus 
softly. They were dating, gradually, but both were feeling awfully 
tentative about it.

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Minako answered with a smile. She 
hesitated, &quot;You know who Natsuna was, of course, but I was 
wondering...&quot;

        &quot;Who Yayoi was?&quot; Mokoto finished the question for her. She 
smiled sadly, &quot;A former partner of mine, one I wish I had treated 
better.&quot;

        Catrine navigated through the crowds, a girl with a 
mission. &quot;Erica,&quot; she snagged her classmate&#39;s arm, &quot;I never expected 
to see you here.&quot;

        &quot;I should have,&quot; Erica smiled wryly.

        Catrine didn&#39;t catch the tone as she gushed, &quot;Are you a 
ancestor of one of the companions, or a relation to one of the 
guests?&quot;

        Erica considered fibbing a moment, but decided against 
it. &quot;Neither,&quot; she finally answered, &quot;I&#39;m related to a Senshi.&quot;

        Catrine&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Descended from a Senshi family.. 
incredible. Which one?&quot;

        Erica nodded to where Lady Neptune and Uranus were talking 
with guests. &quot;My parents are over there,&quot; she smiled.

        Catrine looked at Lady Uranus, then at Erica, her eyes going 
wide. &quot;You... you&#39;re.. why didn&#39;t I see it before?&quot; she asked 
weakly. Before Erica could say anything, Catrine was gone, almost 
shoving through the crowd to get away from her.

        &quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Lady Neptune asked her daughter a few 
moments later, using her most motherly tones.

        Erica still looked in confusion towards where Catrine had 
gone, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

        In another part of the city one of the oldest buildings 
stood. Preserved through both war and peace, the converted warehouse 
that housed Arisugawa&#39;s Locked had remained. Cyber Six smiled to 
herself, standing guard as the leather clad woman cheerfully 
welcomed people inside.

        The blue haired woman made her way up to the door, her 
almost metallic silver hair flowing back in two ponytails. The 
military uniform that she wore was crisp, signifying her to be an 
officer in the Queen&#39;s space navy. She gave Cyber Six a nod, &quot;I was 
surprised to see you out here tonight.&quot;

        &quot;Captain Ruri,&quot; Cyber Six gave her a grave nod, &quot;I can 
remember just as well out here, thanks. Some of my best memories are 
out here under the stars.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Ruri agreed before going on inside.

        The bar itself was filled with people, both familiar faces 
and a few new ones there too. The dance floor was packed, a woman 
cheerfully doing kareoke to a song nearly a thousand years old. The 
library had several readers in it, couches all occupied, and the bar 
was lined with people.

        Making her way to the bar Ruri smiled grimly, climbing up on 
a stool beside a tall, beautiful brown haired woman. She waved to 
the bartender, &quot;Mahoro, can I get a beer?&quot;

        Mahoro whizzed by her, the dark haired former combat android 
giving Ruri a little grin as she dropped the beer off, &quot;Here you go!&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Ruri waved. She turned to the woman beside her, 
gentling her tone, &quot;Juri came by earlier, didn&#39;t she May?&quot;

        Cyberdoll May smiled slightly, giving her friend a nod. &quot;She 
gave a toast to all the Locket employees who weren&#39;t with us,&quot; she 
said quietly. She took a drink of something that looked 
potent, &quot;Sometimes, I wish I could get drunk.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll trade you one of my hangovers,&quot; Ruri smiled, &quot;they 
aren&#39;t fun.&quot;

        May chuckled softly. She smiled a bit more 
naturally, &quot;Thanks, Ruri. You always seem to know how to cheer me 
up.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Ruri answered softly.

        &quot;You&#39;re a good friend,&quot; May finished.

        Ruri sighed at that comment, but May didn&#39;t notice.

        Cyber Six felt a hand on her shoulder, and turned to see who 
had come up behind her. The redhead had a gentle smile on her face, 
and an expression that was oddly cat-like. &quot;Nuku Nuku?&quot; she blinked 
in surprise.

        The android smiled slightly in return, &quot;It&#39;s been a long 
time.&quot; Nuku Nuku softly added, &quot;I was wondering if you&#39;d care to 
come in for a dance? I&#39;m tired of remembering alone.&quot;

        Cyber Six opened her mouth to refuse, then hesitated. A 
slight smile, &quot;All right.&quot; The two walked inside together, talking 
softly.
