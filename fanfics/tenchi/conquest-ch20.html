<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Interlude: Galaxy Police

        Kiyone slipped away from the crowd that was standing around 
Mitsuki, taking a moment to try to recover her composure. She had been 
startled to feel tears coming upon seeing the redheaded officer there 
alive, considering what had passed between them.

        &#39;I guess time really does heal all wounds,&#39; Kiyone mused, 
remembering when they had parted all those years ago...

        The silvery Galaxy Police cruiser smoothly docked with the 
massive central base, the small control room of the snug ship having 
been ominously quiet for most of the trip back there. Finally Mitsuki 
softly reported, &quot;We&#39;re home, at last.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe not my home for very much longer,&quot; Kiyone coolly 
unstrapped herself, pushing herself out of the compartment. In the 
ship&#39;s reduced gravity field she nearly flew down the hallway, using 
expertly placed handholds to pull herself along.

        Mitsuki quickly got free to try and follow her, skimming down 
the hallway in hot pursuit. She caught up with Kiyone just in time to 
say defensively, &quot;I sent in a preliminary report, just like the 
regulations demand.&quot;

        There was a real fire in Kiyone&#39;s eyes, enough to make Mitsuki 
back away from her a step. The black haired officer scowled, &quot;Some 
report! Not a word about Kagato&#39;s defeat, or the lives that were 
saved.&quot; A breath as she quoted bitterly, &quot;GP officer Kiyone has 
disobeyed direct orders, am returning to base to provide full report.&quot;

        &quot;Kiyone, I&#39;m not your enemy here,&quot; was what Mitsuki quietly 
said, raising up her hands as they floated there just outside of 
Kiyone&#39;s quarters, &quot;I&#39;m just following my oaths, the same way that you 
would.&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Kiyone said to her simply, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t. Not this way.&quot; 
With that, she keyed her door open, slipped inside, and locked it 
behind her. For just a moment Kiyone thought she heard someone crying 
on the other side, but she swiftly dismissed that idea.

        Kiyone looked around her quarters regretfully, thinking again 
of what she might be losing soon. But faced with the same 
circumstances again, watching ships being blown out of space and being 
ask to do nothing about it, she knew she&#39;d act.

        &quot;I just wish it hadn&#39;t been Ryouko I helped,&quot; Kiyone muttered.

        The dresser drawers were all quickly cleared out, her casual 
clothes packed away. The uniforms were stowed away a bit more 
carefully, then she put away all the momentos that she had accumulated 
over the past few years. With a soft sigh she sat down on her couch 
and waited for the call that she knew was coming soon.

        It took only a few moments before the communicator chimed into 
the silence. Kiyone reached over to activate it, &quot;Yes?&quot;

        &quot;Officer Kiyone?&quot; She nodded, and the older officer continued 
reluctantly, &quot;It is my duty to inform you that there is a court of 
inquiry being held in regard of your actions in the &#39;Kagato&#39; incident. 
It will be convened tomorrow, at 0800 hours.&quot;

        &#39;That certainly was quick,&#39; Kiyone thought, &#39;I wonder if they 
want this trial to be as short and simple as possible?&#39; Realizing that 
he expected an answer she nodded firmly, &quot;Yes, sir. Will an advocate 
be assigned to me?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; he nodded back simply, &quot;Officer Kieran has been 
assigned from the judge advocate general to work on your case.&quot; He 
provided her comm code and added, &quot;I&#39;d recommend you meet with her 
before the court tomorrow.&quot;

        &#39;Obviously something&#39;s brewing,&#39; Kiyone noted. &quot;I&#39;ll do that, 
sir,&quot; she said. The older man disconnected, and she leaned back with a 
soft sigh. She patched the comm code in, and in only a few moments the 
connection was made.

        Officer Kieran&#39;s eyes widened slightly as she recognized 
Kiyone. Before Kiyone could even say anything the sandy blonde firmly 
said, &quot;We need to meet, Kiyone, in person.&quot;

        &#39;All right, there&#39;s definitely something going on,&#39; Kiyone 
thought. She knew Kieran from when the older officer had taught space 
law back at the academy, and she was not a person who fooled around. 
&quot;When and where?&quot; she asked crisply.

        &quot;Soonest,&quot; Kieran scowled, &quot;there&#39;s a decent bar here on base. 
We&#39;ll meet there.&quot; With that, she abruptly disconnected.

        Kiyone got up and moved to the door, picking up her bags. She 
couldn&#39;t stay on board this honorable ship, not with this hanging over 
her head. She slipped out, leaving the empty room unlocked, and 
smoothly made her way to the docking port.

        Somehow, Kiyone wasn&#39;t too surprised when Mitsuki intercepted 
her on the way out. &quot;You&#39;re leaving the ship?&quot; she asked, pushing her 
red hair back impatiently.

        &quot;I&#39;ll be staying over on the base until this is settled,&quot; 
Kiyone said simply. She keyed open the port and moved into the docking 
tube when Mitsuki grabbed her foot. &quot;What?&quot;

        &quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; Mitsuki started, &quot;I mean...&quot;

        &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Kiyone shook herself free, then pushed off 
smoothly, leaving Mitsuki standing there in the airlock behind her.

        &quot;Officer on deck!&quot; the young man, so new that the polish 
hadn&#39;t been rubbed off him yet, threw an almost perfect salute.

        It took Kiyone a real effort not to laugh. &#39;Guess the story 
hasn&#39;t made it into the rumor mill yet,&#39; she thought bleakly. &quot;Guest 
quarters?&quot; she barked.

        The boy stiffened up even more, if that was even possible. 
&quot;Two levels up, on the inner ring, ma&#39;am,&quot; he reported.

        &quot;And where can I get a drink around here?&quot; Kiyone smiled just 
slightly.

        The boy blinked, &quot;Also two levels up, on the outer ring.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kiyone gave him a casual wave of her hand before 
stepping on to the moving sidewalk up the long hallway. She reached 
the lift a few moments later, rose up the required two levels and then 
checked into a open suite. She dropped her bags off there and re-keyed 
the lock to her ID before going to find the bar.

        Almost as soon as Kiyone went inside the dark, shadowy bar, 
she saw Officer Kieran sitting at one of the back tables. She 
cautiously made her way through the crowd and settled down into a 
seat, meeting the older woman&#39;s sympathetic gaze.

        &quot;For various political reasons the higher-ups don&#39;t monitor 
this place,&quot; Officer Kieran said simply, &quot;we can talk safely here.&quot;

        The visibly pale Kiyone&#39;s eyes widened slightly before she 
blurted out to her, &quot;What in the hell is going on out here?&quot;

        &quot;You really don&#39;t get it, do you?&quot; Officer Kieran sighed.

        Kiyone waved down a waitress and quickly ordered something 
very strong and probably near poisonous. Once the lady left Kiyone 
fixed Kieran with a look, &quot;Educate me.&quot;

        Kieran nodded to her crisply, &quot;Ryouko is not on our most 
Galaxy&#39;s most wanted list because she&#39;s committed the acts of piracy 
that the Marshal claims she did.&quot;

        The drinks were delivered and Kiyone took a long pull of hers 
before asking, &quot;So why are we all going after her, then?&quot;

        &quot;The Marshal is in bed with the Empire of Jurai,&quot; Kieran said 
to her bluntly, &quot;and the Empire wants Ryouko dead or brought back in 
chains.&quot; With a sigh she added, &quot;And you had a shot at actually doing 
that, but instead you helped her.&quot;

        &quot;Shit,&quot; Kiyone muttered. What had been a bad situation, with 
her having disobeyed orders, was now a whole lot worse. The Marshal 
would be under pressure from Jurai, and he&#39;d probably need to find a 
scapegoat of some kind.

        &quot;They&#39;re going to throw the book at you,&quot; Officer Kieran said 
with a sigh, &quot;unless I can pull off some kind of deal for you.&quot;

        &quot;And if I don&#39;t want to make a deal?&quot; Kiyone leaned back in 
her chair, taking another drink before meeting Kieran&#39;s gaze.

        &quot;I&#39;ll defend you to the very best of my abilities,&quot; Officer 
Kieran said with a great deal of sympathetically, &quot;but I can&#39;t really 
refute the basic facts of their case. You did disobey the orders, 
whatever the circumstances.&quot;

        &quot;And what happens then?&quot; Kiyone asked.

        &quot;Stockade,&quot; Kieran answered crisply, &quot;for twenty to life. And 
with the Marshal being involved, you&#39;ll likely be held to the 
maximum.&quot;

        Kiyone nodded slightly. &quot;And if we deal?&quot;

        &quot;The prosecutor contacted me after I was assigned the case,&quot; 
Kieran said softly, &quot;if you publicly admit that you made an error in 
judgment in aiding the &#39;Space Pirate Ryouko&#39; they&#39;ll simply kick you 
out with a dishonorable discharge.&quot;

        There was something in Kieran&#39;s tone of voice and the sandy 
haired woman&#39;s eyes glittered dangerously. &quot;You&#39;re angry,&quot; Kiyone 
blinked.

        &quot;Hell yes I&#39;m angry,&quot; Kieran bit out angrily, &quot;you&#39;re a fine 
officer, and under any other conditions you&#39;d be getting a promotion 
right now. But instead, I&#39;m going to have to do my very best to keep 
you out of the stockade!&quot;

        Kiyone reached out to pat the woman&#39;s arm, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

        The two sat at the darkness of the corner table in the station 
bar for a few moments, drinking silently as the bar&#39;s noises rolled 
right over them. Kieran was clearly still upset about the situation, 
but Kiyone felt an odd sort of calm coming over her. The dark haired 
officer drank her booze thoughtfully, considering her situation.

        &quot;Take the deal,&quot; Kiyone finally said softly.

        Kieran looked up at her in surprise, &quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot;

        &quot;Even if you pulled off a miracle and I actually won,&quot; Kiyone 
said with a sigh, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d really want to stay in an 
organization that lets something like this happen.&quot;

        Kieran nodded reluctantly, &quot;I can sympathize.&quot; She stretched 
out uncomfortably, &quot;I&#39;ll call the prosecutor, try to get something set 
up for tomorrow.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kiyone picked up her drink, finishing it in a long 
pull, &quot;I&#39;m gonna go get some rest, and get ready for tomorrow.&quot;

        The two walked out of the bar together, and Kiyone blinked in 
honest surprise at the Galaxy Police officer who was waiting outside 
for them. The dusky skinned blonde smiled up at Kiyone shyly before 
asking her, &quot;Can I talk to you?&quot;

        &quot;Mihoshi?&quot; Kiyone looked at her in confusion.

        Kieran gave Kiyone a slight smile, &quot;I&#39;ll see you in the 
morning.&quot;

        They made their way to one of the larger view ports, gazing 
out at the stars together. &quot;You really didn&#39;t do those things, did 
you?&quot; Mihoshi looked up at her earnestly.

        Kiyone felt a moment of deep pain. &quot;Yes, I did,&quot; she said 
firmly. Mihoshi was a good friend, someone she trusted, and she 
refused to draw her into this mess. &quot;I&#39;m bad news, Mihoshi,&quot; she said 
softly, &quot;you need to stay as far away from me as you can.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re a good person,&quot; Mihoshi said intensely, &quot;There&#39;s no 
way you&#39;d disobey an order without a very good reason.&quot; Tears 
glistened in her eyes, &quot;I believe in you.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m pleading guilty to the charges tomorrow,&quot; Kiyone made her 
voice as hard as she could as she continued, &quot;and you do not want to 
be caught up in that.&quot; She strode away, ignoring Mihoshi&#39;s soft words 
behind her.

        The trial the next morning was all purely for show, even 
Kiyone could see that. Any motion that Kieran put forward in her 
defense was quickly quashed, overruled by the prosecution or by the 
admiral who was overseeing the case. Even after Kiyone actually plead 
guilty Mitsuki was ordered to the stand and give her evidence.

        The redhead looked straight ahead as Mitsuki expressionlessly 
narrated the battle between Ryouko&#39;s fleet and Kagato&#39;s ship. She 
explained how they were ordered to observe, and Kiyone&#39;s discovery of 
a flaw in Kagato&#39;s shields. Then Kiyone disobeyed her orders, 
transmitted information to Ryouko&#39;s ships, then brought their ship 
into Ryouko&#39;s battleline. And all the time, she completely refused to 
meet Kiyone&#39;s eyes.

        Not long after Kiyone stood there before the Admiral as she 
was formerly dismissed from the Galaxy Police. Rank insignia and 
medals were torn from the cloth of her uniform, and Kiyone fought back 
the harsh sting of tears. But the worst was as she was leaving, 
hearing a command officer talking to Mitsuki about the promotion she 
had earned...

        Kiyone felt a gentle hand on her arm, and turned from where 
she was leaning to meet Mihoshi&#39;s gentle gaze. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, love?&quot; 
she asked her softly, &quot;We should be inside celebrating Mitsuki&#39;s 
return.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll be inside in a few minutes,:&quot; Kiyone promised her. She 
smiled fondly as Mihoshi walked inside. Mihoshi had resigned after 
Kiyone&#39;s trial, following her to Ryouko&#39;s fleet. It had taken a bit of 
effort, but she had finally made Kiyone understand she wanted to be 
more than friends.

        &#39;If not for that trial, I wouldn&#39;t have everything I do now,&#39; 
Kiyone thought with a smile. &#39;More than enough reason to forgive her.&#39; 
She pushed off the stone wall smoothly and walked inside, to party 
tonight and prepare for the battles to come tomorrow.
