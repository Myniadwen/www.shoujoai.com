<h1>Sasami's Quest (A questionable epilogue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I don&#39;t want to hear any complaints about the content. Writing style, 
grammar, and spelling are all up for grabs though. MST if you want. As 
for the rest of you look, no Tenchi and Ryoko or Mihoshi and Kiyone!

------------------------------------------------------------

  Aeka watched from the window as Sasami ran through the grass with 
Ryo-ohki. In her chest she felt something clench. Questions flitted 
through her head, &quot;How can I face her again? How can I allow myself 
anywhere near my little sister? What if I did it again?&quot; Her mind kept 
moving back to that night Sasami had seen her masturbating. Partially 
insane with lust Aeka had called her sister over, giving the pretence 
that she was teaching Sasami something that she&#39;d need to know anyway.
  The next day she&#39;d felt so bad about it that she&#39;d actually asked 
Ryoko for a ride to Jurai to speak with her mother... not that it 
helped. She&#39;d backed out in the end and had simply claimed that she 
had missed her mother and wanted to see her. Then Ryoko had taken her 
back and here she was.
  Sasami didn&#39;t seem to notice. Sometimes Aeka forgot that her sister 
was over seven hundred years old. Aeka herself was twice that age. 
She&#39;d been five hundred before she&#39;d even asked about sex like Sasami 
had. Early for a Juraian. Sasami was at the average age. &quot;And I used 
her.&quot; Wrapping her arms tightly around herself, Aeka turned from the 
window and went inside.

  Washu smiled as Mihoshi entered the lab. &quot;Took you long enough?&quot;
  &quot;You called?&quot; Mihoshi asked, nervously looking around. &quot;Do you need 
help with something?&quot;
  &quot;Oh yes.&quot; She said with an evil grin. &quot;I&#39;m doing a series of... 
tests. Could you please disrobe and get onto this platform?&quot; She 
indicated a door sized piece of metal with a step set up in the middle 
of the lab.
  &quot;Sure.&quot; Mihoshi said brightly. Without hesitation she quickly 
slipped off her shirt, pants and then her bra.
  Washu raised an eyebrow. &quot;No underwear?&quot;
  Mihoshi shook her head. &quot;Nah, I didn&#39;t feel like it. I was going to 
wear some red ones, but I couldn&#39;t find them. They&#39;re probably buried 
in my room somewhere.&quot;
  Keeping her face neutral Washu began attaching some electrodes to 
Mihoshi&#39;s body over her nipples, neck, temples, and just under her 
stomach. She couldn&#39;t help notice Mihoshi&#39;s skin get goose bumps as 
she leaned into the metal table behind her.
  &quot;So what are the tests for?&quot;
  &quot;What?&quot; Washu came quickly back to reality. &quot;Oh I&#39;m just testing to 
see how different people developed as they age.&quot; She held out her hand 
and her computer appeared. &quot;Now just answer my questions as they come 
up.&quot;
  &quot;Okay.&quot;
  &quot;When did you hit puberty?&quot;
  &quot;When I was six hundred and twelve.&quot;
  &quot;And do you masturbate?&quot;
  Mihoshi paused. &quot;What?&quot;
  &quot;I don&#39;t believe I stuttered.&quot; Washu grinned. &quot;Do you touch yourself 
to experience pleasure?&quot;
  &quot;Can we move onto a new question?&quot; She asked hopefully.
  Washu nodded. &quot;Okay, but Sasami answered.&quot; Her grin widened when she 
saw Mihoshi&#39;s blood temperature shoot up. &quot;Surely you aren&#39;t afraid to 
answer questions that Sasami could. She told me all sorts of 
interesting things.&quot;
  Mihoshi&#39;s foot moved towards the edge of the table. &quot;Really?&quot;
  &quot;Yes. All about you.&quot; Washu smiled. &quot;You know she really thinks you 
slept through the whole thing?&quot;
  Mihoshi froze in place. Washu saw that her heart was beating against 
her chest. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
  &quot;Oh I think you know. I&#39;m not Sasami after all and I&#39;m not that 
naive. There are some things even you couldn&#39;t sleep through.&quot; Washu&#39;s 
chair moved slowly around Mihoshi like a shark. &quot;Losing your virginity 
to the princess of Jurai would have woken even you up.&quot; She hit a 
button and Mihoshi jumped as a screen popped up in front of her face.
  &quot;What...&quot; She stopped when she saw what was playing.
  &quot;It must have been hard on you, all these years. You must have had a 
very sheltered life. The daughter of a police officer and the 
granddaughter of the marshal? A lot of boys would have been scared off 
by that.&quot; Mihoshi nodded, unable to look away from the screen. She 
winced when she saw Sasami slide off her panties on the screen and 
begin to lick her. Not because she hadn&#39;t liked it, or even because of 
the pain she&#39;d experienced then. It was because while the princess had 
been otherwise occupied Mihoshi had briefly opened her eyes and licked 
her tongue over the spots on her mouth that Sasami had been kissing 
only minutes before.
  &quot;When did you know she wanted you?&quot; Washu asked, watching Mihoshi&#39;s 
face.
  &quot;In the pool.&quot; The detective responded slowly. &quot;She kept trying to 
grab my breasts.&quot;
  &quot;Who could blame her?&quot; Washu said. &quot;She&#39;s only just discovering how 
good it can feel to be with a person. Aeka almost ruined the whole 
thing for you though. Sasami was beginning to think it was wrong.&quot;
  &quot;Beginning to?&quot; Mihoshi glanced at the scientist. &quot;What did you do?&quot;
  &quot;Do you want to see?&quot;
  Mihoshi wasn&#39;t sure. She was so horny right then that she just 
wanted to lock herself in the quiet of her room for a few hours. But 
her curiosity and hormones got the better of her. &quot;Yes.&quot;
  The image of Sasami slipping Mihoshi&#39;s panties into her pocket was 
replaced by images of the young girl strapped to the very table 
Mihoshi was now leaning against. Along the edge of the image were 
clear graphs with labels like &#39;hormone levels&#39; and &#39;sexual tension&#39;. 
She listened to Sasami&#39;s breath and watched her squirm as Washu began 
to ask her more and more erotic questions. Cum dripped down her leg 
when she saw Washu lean her back and slowly, methodically bring Sasami 
to orgasm. &quot;Oh gods...&quot;
  Washu laughed. &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;
  &quot;I could never...&quot; The words caught in her throat as images flipped 
through her imagination.
  &quot;You want to though don&#39;t you? That eager little face looking down 
at you as you shove your face between her legs?&quot; Washu hopped down 
from her chair and walked over to Mihoshi, her hear level with the 
blonde&#39;s navel. &quot;I could help.&quot;
  &quot;I won&#39;t force her or trick her into anything. I wouldn&#39;t do that!&quot; 
Mihoshi said.
  &quot;I know.&quot; She reached out and rubbed Mihoshi&#39;s thigh, making her 
jump. &quot;But she wants you as much as you want her.&quot;
  &quot;What about you?&quot; Mihoshi asked.
  &quot;Oh I&#39;ve considered it.&quot; She slowly ran a finger picking up some of 
the juice from Mihoshi&#39;s shivering legs and licked it off. &quot;But I 
think I&#39;d rather wait until you&#39;ve had her.&quot; She winked. &quot;Then I&#39;ll 
bring you both in here and show it to you and see where we get.&quot;
  Mihoshi looked down at her in shock. The most amazing part was that 
the idea turned her on almost as much as the videos had. &quot;Yes... 
please.&quot; She paused. &quot;But Sasami... she&#39;s so young.&quot;
  &quot;Old enough, apparently.&quot; Washu said. &quot;Older than you were. What did 
you want when you were that age?&quot;
  Mihoshi thought about it. &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;
  &quot;Well we know what she wants.&quot;
  &quot;Yeah, and we know what her parents think of Aeka being in love with 
Tenchi.&quot;
  &quot;They think she should have picked Yosho. But I see your point.&quot; She 
paused long enough to look at Mihoshi&#39;s hard nipples. &quot;However Sasami 
isn&#39;t the first princess and her parents aren&#39;t here. How would they 
find out?&quot; Whispering, she finished, &quot;And do you really care?&quot;
  Forcing herself to calm down Mihoshi considered everything Washu had 
said. She couldn&#39;t let lust and hormones make a decision like that.
  Neither of them was sure how long they stood there waiting for 
Mihoshi&#39;s answer. Both of them had let the wave of hormones pass. But 
the idea that it could come back and be fulfilled still hung in the 
air.
  &quot;What do you think I should do?&quot;

  After Aeka had left the window Sasami had taken Ryo-ohki to the 
carrot shed to talk.
  &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back. I&#39;ve been wanting to talk to you about 
something.&quot;
  &quot;Meow?&quot; Ryo-ohki sat back on her hind legs and looked up.
  Sasami sat down against the wall of the shed and sucked her lip. 
&quot;Can you keep Ryoko from knowing something you do?&quot; The cabbit nodded 
her head. &quot;Well lately some thing&#39;s been happening to me.&quot; She told 
Ryo-ohki all about the events of the last week. First how Aeka had 
asked for help pleasuring herself that night in their room. Then how 
she&#39;d been alone with Mihoshi asleep and had touched her and then 
herself. After that she told Ryo-ohki what Washu had done with her in 
the lab. Finally she told her about what she&#39;d done with Mihoshi 
earlier. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do. I liked it... a lot. I really want 
to do it again, but I&#39;m so embarrassed.&quot; She sighed, absently petting 
the cabbit&#39;s head. &quot;Not with Aeka though... she just wanted me to do 
stuff for her. Washu wanted that too I guess, but at least she gave 
something back. And Mihoshi...&quot; She closed her eyes as things in her 
lower abdomen clenched. She was getting wet again. Absently her left 
hand that wasn&#39;t petting Ryo-ohki began rubbing the folds of her dress 
between her legs.
  It took her a moment to realize something was happening to her right 
hand. Her eyes snapped open and she turned to see Ryo-ohki with her 
mouth wrapped around Sasami&#39;s ring finger, the tips of her sharp teeth 
almost but not quite poking through the skin. &quot;Ryo-ohki what are 
you...&quot; She felt the cabbit&#39;s tiny tongue gently lick at her fingertip 
and a rumbling vibration as she started to purr.
  Sasami&#39;s breath caught in her throat. &quot;Oh...&quot; Sasami smiled and her 
free hand began moving again. Tugging her dress up to her lap she 
quickly slipped a finger into her wet panties and over her clit.
  While Sasami watched Ryo-ohki began to slowly change. Usually she 
just transformed instantly, but this time she dragged it out. Her 
front legs stretched into arms while the hind legs grew and spread 
behind her. Soon furry lips had sucked Sasami&#39;s entire finger in while 
soft breasts lay against her legs.
  &quot;Ryo-ohki wait!&quot; Sasami breathed. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
  Letting go Ryo-ohki sat back, panting. &quot;Meow.&quot; Her nose twitched and 
her hand slip over to Sasami&#39;s pocket, pulling out the red underwear 
she&#39;d taken from Mihoshi.
  &quot;You mean those stories I told you made you want to do it too?&quot; 
Ryo-ohki nodded slowly. &quot;But will you feel the same later? I always 
feel so embarrassed and Aeka doesn&#39;t even want to look at me any 
more.&quot; Sasami reached over and rubbed Ryo-ohki&#39;s cheek. &quot;You&#39;re my 
best friend. I couldn&#39;t stand that!&quot; She leaned forward and hugged 
Ryo-ohki tightly. Then she jumped up, grabbed the panties back, and 
ran out of the shed.
  Ryo-ohki watched her go. Finally she meowed in exasperation and 
grabbed a handful of carrots. She&#39;d just have to hope nobody came to 
the shed for a while.

  Sasami ran into the house, her legs buckling under her. She wanted 
to turn around and run back to her friend. To bury her face in that 
soft fur, licking and sucking until they both passed out. To have 
those furry fingers bury themselves in her over and over until the fur 
was matted and stuck down and then lick it all off.
  But what then? Aeka stared at her with such love, but behind her 
eyes Sasami had seen self-loathing. Sasami hadn&#39;t felt bad about it. 
She&#39;d wanted Aeka to do back to her what she&#39;d shown her how to do. 
Then there was the &#39;but&#39; again. Aeka, after the lust had gone, hadn&#39;t 
felt it was a good thing. It was too late to stop her sister from 
making that mistake, but she wasn&#39;t going to let Ryo-ohki do it too.
  Falling back onto the couch she realized that she was still 
clutching Mihoshi&#39;s panties. The stale smell of her sex still clung to 
it. Before it had made her weak in the knees, but now it was making 
her chest ache.
  &quot;It&#39;s happening to me.&quot; That was why she was scared. In her heart 
she felt guilty. Not for what she&#39;d done with Washu. That she only had 
pleasant memories about. She felt guilty about the way she&#39;d taken 
what she&#39;d wanted from Mihoshi. &quot;Have I been looking at her they way 
Aeka looks at me?&quot;
  She knew she had to have been, whether Mihoshi noticed or not. 
Sasami had been edgy since she&#39;d done it and had purposely avoided 
her. If she didn&#39;t feel guilty she could tell Mihoshi what she&#39;d done. 
What had happened with Aeka was her secret to keep, but this was what 
Sasami had done. It was Sasami&#39;s responsibility.
  Suddenly she heard footsteps on the stairs at the same time the door 
to Washu&#39;s lab opened. Out of instinct Sasami stuffed the panties back 
into her pocket.
  &quot;Sasami?&quot; Aeka&#39;s voice said.
  &quot;Yes Aeka?&quot; She said.
  Aeka walked over to the couch, glancing at Washu and Mihoshi as they 
stopped to watch her. &quot;I&#39;ve come to a decision. I need my own space. 
If it&#39;s alright with you, I&#39;d like a room to myself.&quot; I don&#39;t trust 
myself. Aeka might as well have said it.
  &quot;But sister... where will I sleep?&quot;
  &quot;Why not Mihoshi&#39;s room?&quot; Washu said quickly.
  &quot;What?&quot; All three of the others said. Aeka was merely surprised, but 
the other two were shocked. Sasami, because she realized the same 
thing Aeka had. If she were alone in a room with Mihoshi sleeping all 
the time she&#39;d never be able to control herself. Mihoshi was shocked 
because this had nothing to do with the plan that she&#39;d just spent 
half an hour working out with Washu.
  &quot;Well why not? Unless any of you don&#39;t like the idea,&quot; Washu looked 
directly at Sasami, who squirmed in her place. Sasami knew all too 
well that Washu knew how she felt about Mihoshi. If Aeka hadn&#39;t been 
there she would have probably spilled the whole story to Mihoshi right 
then and there.
  &quot;No, I don&#39;t mind.&quot; She found herself saying. A smile crossed 
Sasami&#39;s lips.
  Mihoshi felt herself give in too and nodded. &quot;It might be fun.&quot;
  Aeka looked down at Sasami, &quot;I do love you Sasami.&quot;
  &quot;I know Aeka.&quot; She winked. &quot;I love you too, but if you need your own 
place, that&#39;s fine.&quot;
  &quot;If you ever have a nightmare...&quot; Aeka began.
  &quot;You&#39;ll be right across the hall.&quot;
  Washu smiled and said, &quot;Why don&#39;t the three of you go move Sasami&#39;s 
things? I have things in the lab I need to work on.&quot; She caught 
Mihoshi&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;ll see you all later.&quot; She turned and disappeared 
into the dark door.

  Aeka set Sasami&#39;s pillow down at the head of her cot and stood back. 
&quot;Well that&#39;s it.&quot;
  &quot;Yeah.&quot; Sasami said. &quot;Well see you at dinner Aeka.&quot; Aeka nodded and 
walked away.
  Mihoshi sat on her own cot. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind staying in here 
Sasami.&quot;
  &quot;No. It&#39;s okay.&quot; Sasami said. &quot;You don&#39;t mind that I&#39;m taking up 
your space?&quot;
  &quot;No.&quot; Mihoshi looked out the window. &quot;I do snore though. All the 
time.&quot;
  &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve heard you.&quot;
  &quot;Even when I&#39;m taking my naps.&quot; That sentence simply hung in the air 
for a while.
  &quot;Every time?&quot; Sasami asked at last. Mihoshi nodded. &quot;So the other 
day-&quot;
  &quot;I was awake.&quot; Mihoshi finished. She waited to hear what Sasami 
would say next. When nothing came she turned to look at the young 
princess.
  Sasami was looking at her with tears streaming from her eyes. Her 
shoulders heaved with suppressed sobs. But she didn&#39;t look away.
  Mihoshi quickly moved across the room and wrapped her arms around 
the crying girl, hugging her tightly. Sasami hugged her back, burying 
her face in the blonde&#39;s hair. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;
  &quot;Shh! Don&#39;t be sorry Sasami.&quot; She leaned her face into Sasami&#39;s 
hair. &quot;I&#39;m not.&quot;
  &quot;But I thought you were asleep and I didn&#39;t tell you!&quot; She said, her 
voice muffled. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell you what I did. I was ashamed.&quot;
  &quot;But I didn&#39;t tell you either.&quot; Mihoshi said rubbing the girl&#39;s 
hair. &quot;Please, don&#39;t cry. Just tell me now. Say what you need to.&quot;
  &quot;I just wanted you so much!&quot; Sasami said. &quot;I haven&#39;t felt this way 
before. I mean I&#39;ve thought about it, but lately it&#39;s just so... I 
can&#39;t control it. And if I told Aeka she&#39;d blame herself and I 
couldn&#39;t bring myself to tell you because I thought...&quot;
  &quot;You thought I might be mad?&quot; Sasami nodded against her.
  &quot;But then Washu...&quot; She stopped.
  Mihoshi said, &quot;It&#39;s okay, she told me.&quot;
  Sasami didn&#39;t ask why or what had happened. &quot;It just felt so good! I 
know it shouldn&#39;t make me embarrassed but it does. Just now Ryo-ohki 
tried and I... I had to stop. I was so afraid that the same thing 
would happen with her!&quot; She pushed back and looked up at Mihoshi. 
&quot;Please don&#39;t feel bad about it!&quot;
  Mihoshi smiled, her light blue eyes sparkling. &quot;Sasami, did I ever 
complain? When you were doing it did I stop you? When you tried to 
feel me up in the pool did I pull away?&quot;
  Sasami blushed deeply. &quot;I didn&#39;t think you knew.&quot;
  &quot;Well not the first time. But when you almost drowned...&quot;
  &quot;You know I really bumped my head.&quot; Sasami said with a pout. &quot;It 
hurt a lot.&quot;
  &quot;I&#39;ll bet!&quot; Mihoshi said brightly. &quot;And if you&#39;d stayed down there 
looking at my pussy any longer you would have drowned for real.&quot;
  &quot;It&#39;s not funny!&quot;
  Mihoshi giggled and poked her in the chest. &quot;And what did you think 
you were going to do anyway?&quot; Sasami blushed deeper. &quot;You look like 
Tenchi!&quot;
  Rubbing her cheeks Sasami tried to hold in her laughter. She failed 
miserably and soon they were both rolling on the cot, barely able to 
breath. When they finally calmed down they lay there breathing hard, 
smiling at each other.
  &quot;Did Washu tell you everything?&quot; Sasami asked.
  &quot;Yeah. With video tapes.&quot; This time Sasami was too tired to blush.
  &quot;So did you two...?&quot;
  &quot;No. But she wants to. When we&#39;re comfortable with it.&quot;
  &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t we be comfortable with it?&quot; Sasami asked seriously. 
&quot;Since this started I knew it was something nobody liked to talk 
about, but nobody will explain it to me? I mean I know that&#39;s why 
Tenchi blushes all the time, but I don&#39;t know why!&quot;
  Mihoshi said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I guess it&#39;s just something that if you 
enjoy too much it has to be bad. Or maybe everyone is just silly.&quot;
  &quot;So we shouldn&#39;t tell the others?&quot;
  They both shook their heads and said, &quot;No.&quot;
  &quot;But you know what else Mihoshi?&quot; Sasami said.
  &quot;What?&quot;
  The princess rolled onto her side, looking directly at the 
detective. &quot;If I&#39;m going to feel guilty about this I&#39;d like to have a 
real reason.&quot;
  This time it was Mihoshi&#39;s turn to blush. &quot;Me too. But shouldn&#39;t we 
go down to dinner first?&quot;
  &quot;I guess...&quot; She groaned. &quot;I just don&#39;t want to have to keep 
waiting.&quot;
  &quot;You? I&#39;m the one who had to sit through those videos!&quot; Reluctantly 
they both got up. &quot;The next time I see you naked it had better not 
just leave me standing.&quot;
  &quot;Deal.&quot;

  On their way down the stairs they heard an interesting conversation.
  &quot;Well how was I supposed to know?&quot; Tenchi sounded panicked. &quot;I was 
just dropping in another basket of carrots and then I head something. 
I thought she was eating them.&quot;
  &quot;What do you expect?&quot; Ryoko was saying back.
  &quot;Sasami.&quot; Aeka said quickly, cutting off any response. By the time 
they reached the bottom of the stairs everyone was smiling pleasantly. 
&quot;How do you like your new room?&quot;
  &quot;It&#39;s great.&quot; Sasami said. &quot;What were you guys talking about?&quot; She 
barely contained a snort when she heard Mihoshi giggle.
  &quot;Nothing.&quot; They all said quickly. Behind her she heard a meow and 
saw Ryo-ohki hopping through the wall looking smug. The others all 
stared at her for a minute.
  The rest of the meal was perfectly normal. Noboyuki and Yosho traded 
stories about their days at work while Ryoko and Aeka both hit on 
Tenchi. Sasami talked with Mihoshi about the cartoons that had been on 
earlier and Washu sat there smiling enigmatically.
  When it was over Tenchi offered to do the dishes.
  &quot;No, please let me do them Tenchi. After all when we get married 
I&#39;ll have to do it anyway.&quot; Ryoko said.
  &quot;Yes, when Tenchi and I get married, as out maid you&#39;ll definitely 
have to learn to wash dishes.&quot; Aeka said.
  &quot;What was that?&quot;
  &quot;You heard me.&quot; There was a loud blast. When the smoke cleared 
Tenchi was alone between the two of them. &quot;Help!&quot;
  &quot;You&#39;ll pay for that Aeka!&quot;
  &quot;No, you will!&quot;

  Inside Washu&#39;s lab the three girls leaned against the door as the 
blasts rocked the whole house.
  &quot;Well, looks like I have some repairs to do.&quot; Washu said. &quot;You two 
can wait here until they calm down.&quot; Standing up she walked into the 
shadows of the lab.
  Mihoshi and Sasami sat there on the floor, both looking at each 
other.
  &quot;I guess we&#39;re being silly again.&quot; Mihoshi said.
  Sasami nodded. &quot;Yeah.&quot; She smiled and looked down. &quot;I don&#39;t know. 
I&#39;m just nervous.&quot;
  They were both suddenly distracted by three of Washu&#39;s screens 
appearing all around them. A cackling laugh sounded from the darkness 
but was quickly drowned out by a group of moans and pants. On the 
screen to the left Washu was carefully seducing a bound Sasami as the 
girl squirmed. On the right Ryo-ohki was lying in the carrot shed, 
sliding a carrot in and out of her crotch and purring loudly. In the 
middle was the now familiar scene of Sasami working her way over the 
body of a seemingly unconscious Mihoshi.
  Sasami could feel herself losing control again. The moans and groans 
from the screens were filling her mind and she suddenly wanted to 
touch and be touched.
  Beside her she felt Mihoshi&#39;s fingers link with hers and she smiled. 
&quot;What do you want to do?&quot;
  &quot;I don&#39;t know Sasami.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Would you like to do that 
again?&quot; Sasami looked to where she indicated and saw herself slowly 
undressing the &quot;sleeping&quot; blond.
  Without waiting for an answer Mihoshi lay back on the floor. This 
time her eyes stayed open.
  Sasami moved over to her, walking on hands and knees as Mihoshi lay 
still and waiting. Ryo-ohki let out a loud yowl and Sasami darted 
forward, pressing her lips to Mihoshi&#39;s and sliding her tongue past 
her lips. Mihoshi responded, wrapping her tongue around Sasami&#39;s with 
a moan. Their mouths moved against each other, leaving trails of 
saliva along the outside of their lips, each girl trying to drink the 
other.
  Finally the kiss broke and Sasami pressed her hands onto the front 
of Mihoshi&#39;s shirt. Her fingers sank into Mihoshi&#39;s breasts, the 
nipples pressing into her palm through the fabric.  Reaching down she 
began moving the shirt up and Mihoshi raised her arms to let it come 
off, revealing Sasami&#39;s prize. The large pink nipples on Mihoshi&#39;s 
breasts stuck into the air, her skin bumpy from the cold floor.
  Sasami fell on them instantly, locking her mouth around the left one 
and using both of her small hands to tug at the right. She sucked 
hard, enjoying the feel of Mihoshi writhing and moaning underneath her 
and her teeth scraping over the objects of her desire.
  Suddenly Sasami remembered what she&#39;d learned from Washu. Pulling 
back as Mihoshi watched with interest she grinned and slapped her 
hands down on Mihoshi&#39;s sensitive nipples with a loud crack.
  &quot;Ah!&quot; Mihoshi moaned. Sasami grinned and did it again and again. 
Each time Mihoshi hissed and gasped in pleasure. Then she finally 
said, &quot;Sasami, please. More...&quot;
  Moving down Sasami tugged at the zipper on Mihoshi&#39;s pants. The 
detective slid out of them quickly, kicking them aside and spreading 
her legs. Once again taking a cue from her experience with Washu, 
Sasami sat back and slowly slipped out of her dress while Mihoshi 
watched. She hadn&#39;t been able to find her pink panties since the last 
time she was in the lab, so instead was wearing light blue. Facing 
away from Mihoshi she backed up, until she felt hot breath against her 
crotch.
  Not waiting any more she lay across Mihoshi&#39;s body, feeling the wet 
nipples rub her belly and pushing her crotch into her partner&#39;s face. 
Then her mouth was on Mihoshi&#39;s crotch, her tongue darting through the 
hair into the pink folds of her flesh. It tasted even better than she 
remembered.
  Meanwhile Mihoshi had ideas of her own. The sight of the young woman 
on top of her and the feel of that eager tongue lapping at her pussy 
drove her over the edge. Reaching up she firmly grasped Sasami&#39;s ass 
cheeks and squeezed, leaning in and nibbling over them with her teeth, 
tasting the flesh. Moving her body against Sasami&#39;s she rubbed her 
breasts into the girl&#39;s skin and pinched her sharply, making the girl 
hiss into her and a drop of cum slide down the thin leg in front of 
her.
  &quot;Don&#39;t stop.&quot; Sasami said. &quot;Please don&#39;t stop.&quot; And to keep it fair 
she once again attacked Mihoshi&#39;s pussy with new energy.
  Returning the favor Mihoshi slapped her hands against Sasami&#39;s but 
cheeks, making her squirm and leaving red prints on the skin. Then she 
quickly slid off the panties, while Sasami moved her legs, roughly 
pressing knees and thighs into Mihoshi&#39;s breasts in ways she knew was 
going to leave bruises. When they were gone she latched on yet again 
and pulled Sasami roughly to her, licking around the tiny hairs 
surrounding her pussy and burying her cute nose in Sasami&#39;s ass. They 
both moaned and groaned around their own tongues while muscles began 
twitching. Then Mihoshi wrapped her lips around Sasami&#39;s clit and 
slowly pushed her middle finger into her dripping pussy. Sasami slid 
her tongue into Mihoshi&#39;s pussy along with two of her own fingers. 
When Mihoshi broke through her hymen, Sasami barely noticed, too 
intent of drinking everything Mihoshi had for her. They both came at 
the same time, each clenching around the others digits and screaming 
so loud that they could no longer hear Washu&#39;s movies.
  In the silence that followed Sasami lay limply across Mihoshi. 
Mihoshi gently nuzzled Sasami&#39;s thigh.
  Several minutes later a loud clicking sound broke the peace. Forcing 
themselves to move they saw Washu, in her adult form, wearing nothing 
but a pair of high heels. &quot;You aren&#39;t tired now are you?&quot; They both 
just stared up at her. &quot;Now come on. Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m too much for 
you like this?&quot; She gently lifted up her breasts, squishing them 
against her chest.
  To Mihoshi&#39;s shock it was Sasami who moved first. Her eyes glued to 
Washu she crawled slowly over the blond and latched her lips onto 
Washu&#39;s calf with a moan. Washu fell back onto a pile of pillows that 
had suddenly materialized around them. While Mihoshi watched Sasami&#39;s 
tongue darted in and out of her mouth as she slowly began licking over 
Washu&#39;s feet and up her leg.
  Blood pounding through her crotch she rolled over and took the other 
leg. Through an unspoken agreement she and Sasami kept pace with each 
other, not moving too fast. It allowed them time to recover and made 
Washu squirm in anticipation, soaking the pillows under her butt.
  Meanwhile Washu watched and felt every move the girls made on her. 
Their hair had fallen out of their ponytails, and spread out in soft 
clouds over her skin. In the back of her mind she couldn&#39;t help 
comparing the two of them. Mihoshi seemed to like using her lips more, 
sucking small areas of Washu&#39;s skin into her mouth and moving them 
over her in soft kisses. Sasami on the other hand licked at Washu&#39;s 
skin like ice cream and fondly used her teeth to nip and bite at it, 
in vain attempts to devour her. Writhing in joy Washu reached down, 
running her hands through their hair and along their backs. &quot;Faster!&quot;
  They ignored her and it was nearly five minutes before they reached 
the top of her legs. Each of them took the edge of one butt cheek and 
slowly moved in together. Finally after waiting for what seemed like 
eternity Washu felt warm lips press into her labia. Both girls licked 
and sucked at her in their own ways, their tongues sometimes moving to 
each other as they tried to kiss and still eat at her. Washu felt her 
muscles clench and screamed, the sound echoing off distant lab 
equipment.
  When they both looked up at her she said, &quot;Don&#39;t stop. Please just 
keep going.&quot;
  &quot;Yes.&quot; Sasami said. Leaning down she pressed her mouth fully into 
Washu&#39;s pussy, getting every last drop.
  Washu saw Mihoshi considering what to do next and got an idea. 
Reaching down she tugged at her hair, guiding Mihoshi&#39;s head up to her 
chest. Without further prompting the lips Mihoshi had been using 
elsewhere clamped down on her nipple and began going to work.
  Cool air hit Washu&#39;s pussy and she glanced down to see Sasami 
backing away. &quot;What are you...&quot;
  &quot;Watch.&quot; Sasami said. Turning around she spread her legs and gently 
lifted up one of Washu&#39;s. While the scientist watched she slid one of 
her legs under Washu&#39;s elevated one and slipped along the floor until 
her almost hairless crotch was pressed into the red fur between 
Washu&#39;s.
  &quot;You learn fast.&quot;
  Mihoshi let go of Washu&#39;s breast and turned to see what Sasami was 
doing. She was entranced when the little princess began bucking her 
hips against Washu, rubbing her clit into the puckered pink flesh. 
Sasami had her eyes closed at first simply enjoying the feel of it, 
but then they opened and she saw Mihoshi again. Biting her lip 
Sasami&#39;s eyes traveled over Mihoshi dark tan skin and found herself 
wanting to kiss her.
  Washu watched Mihoshi turn trance-like and crawl on her hands and 
knees towards the princess. Mihoshi bent down and gently kissed 
Sasami&#39;s mouth, just lips no tongue. Not wanting to be left out Washu 
bent forward and pressed her face between Mihoshi&#39;s cheeks and began 
licking along the length of it her tongue traveling from clit to ass 
over and over again.
  Sasami ran her hands over Mihoshi&#39;s chest, still rubbing against 
Washu as fast and hard as she could. Closing her eyes Mihoshi enjoyed 
the feelings coming from either end of her and raised one hand to rub 
over Sasami&#39;s small breasts and belly, feeling muscles quiver under 
soft skin. Sasami&#39;s free leg kicked out over and over, pounding into 
Washu&#39;s large breasts harshly, causing pain and pleasure. All three of 
them began to shiver and shake until...
  &quot;Aaaaahhhhhhh!&quot; None of them were sure who started and didn&#39;t care. 
They just rode out the waves of pleasure again and again until they 
lay in a heap, Sasami pressed between the two older women as they 
nuzzled her neck and cheeks. Legs intertwined around each other that 
it was hard to tell them apart.
  &quot;Mihoshi...&quot; Sasami said. &quot;Now that it&#39;s over... I understand if you 
don&#39;t want me to stay in your room any more.&quot;
  Mihoshi blinked and stared at her in shock. Peering over the 
princess&#39; tangled blue locks, Washu watched to see what she&#39;d do. 
&quot;What do you mean Sasami?&quot;
  &quot;Well I know nothing embarrasses Washu.&quot; Washu smirked behind her. 
&quot;But you&#39;re a police officer and I know sometimes you get embarrassed 
and blush a lot...&quot; She paused, her mind getting side tracked at the 
idea of Mihoshi&#39;s skin turning bright red all over. Forcing herself to 
think straight Sasami continued, &quot;I mean if you think you&#39;ll feel bad 
about this now that we&#39;ve done it I don&#39;t mind if you want to forget 
about the whole thing it&#39;s okay.&quot;
  Mihoshi didn&#39;t know what to say. &quot;Sasami...&quot;
  Washu decided to take the lead. &quot;Sasami, what happened with your 
sister isn&#39;t your fault.&quot;
  Sasami turned to look at her. &quot;But I was the one who started it. I 
kind of knew what was going to happen. I mean I didn&#39;t know, but... 
And Aeka couldn&#39;t help herself. I know that. Sometimes when I think 
about it I can&#39;t stop either.&quot;
  &quot;And that&#39;s perfectly natural. It&#39;s just that your sister can&#39;t cope 
with it. She may never be able to. But that isn&#39;t your fault.&quot; Washu 
said.
  &quot;Yeah!&quot; Mihoshi put in. &quot;Sasami I know it&#39;s a little embarrassing, 
but if it feels good and nobody gets hurt then you can&#39;t blame 
yourself.&quot;
  Sniffling Sasami closed her eyes. &quot;I love you both so much.&quot;
  &quot;We love you too Sasami.&quot; Washu said, kissing her ear.
  Mihoshi made an affirming sound, pressing her lips into Sasami&#39;s 
throat.
  Tilting her head back Sasami smiled. &quot;I believe you. Both of you.&quot; 
She looked down and smiled at them. &quot;But could you...&quot;
  &quot;Show you?&quot; Washu finished. Sasami nodded quickly. &quot;Well that seems 
possible. But before we do is there anybody else you want in on this? 
Before we make any permanent decisions.&quot;
  Sasami gasped. &quot;Oh no! Ryo-ohki! She probably thinks I hate her.&quot; 
She looked at the others. &quot;What can I do?&quot;
  Washu grinned and winked at Mihoshi who just smiled and waited to 
see how things would turn out. &quot;I am a genius you know.&quot; Just then a 
crack of light fell over them.
  &quot;...I&#39;ll kick your wrinkly ass Aeka...&quot; Was cut off when the tiny 
cabbit door closed behind Ryo-ohki.
  &quot;You called her?&quot; Mihoshi asked. Washu nodded. &quot;But what if Ryoko 
heard?&quot;
  &quot;Right now Ryoko is too busy to hear anything.&quot; Washu smiled. &quot;Now 
why don&#39;t we give them some space?&quot;
  Both women backed up, untangling from Sasami, but not moving out of 
easy reach.
  Sasami laid there, her legs spread, and stared across her pale 
stomach at Ryo-ohki. The cabbit was a dark shape in the poorly lit 
room, but her yellow eyes glowed up at Sasami from near the floor. 
&quot;Meow? Myah?&quot;
  &quot;Ryo-ohki, I&#39;m so sorry I left you like that.&quot; Sasami said. &quot;Please 
don&#39;t be angry.&quot;
  Slowly at first, the eyes moved towards her, rising and falling as 
they cabbit bounced. They stopped at Sasami&#39;s feet and began rising 
again... then further and further. Next Sasami felt a furry hand wrap 
around her leg and slowly slide upwards. &quot;Meow?&quot;
  Sasami glanced to the sides at Mihoshi and Washu. Both of them 
nodded encouragement. Looking back down Sasami chewed her lip and 
nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;
  Mihoshi crawled around Sasami&#39;s head to Washu and the two of them 
watched what was happening. Ryo-ohki looked at both of them for a 
moment and then back down at Sasami. Purring loudly she began sliding 
herself up Sasami&#39;s legs, nipping at the flesh with her fangs. &quot;Myah, 
meow myah meow.&quot;
  &quot;She wants us to help.&quot; Washu said. &quot;Is that what you want Sasami?&quot; 
The princess, feeling the lust rise in her again, just nodded.
  Ryo-ohki didn&#39;t look up again. Instead she turned pressing her pussy 
over Sasami&#39;s face and sitting up straight. Sasami reached up with her 
mouth, using her tongue to dig through the fur and find flesh until 
she tasted Ryo-ohki&#39;s pussy. She nibbled at the clit, petting 
Ryo-ohki&#39;s furry ass and shoving her fingers in where her tongue 
couldn&#39;t reach.
  Washu moved next, kissing her way down Sasami&#39;s neck and side she 
quickly made her was to Sasami&#39;s crotch, pushing in two fingers and 
licking between them.
  Mihoshi was last. She decided to try Ryo-ohki and straddled Sasami&#39;s 
belly so she could face the humanoid cabbit. Leaning in she ran her 
fingers over Ryo-ohki&#39;s breasts and felt three nipples press into each 
palm. Squeezing hard she rubbed her pussy into Sasami&#39;s stomach, her 
cum dripping down between the princess&#39; legs and to Washu&#39;s waiting 
mouth.
  Sasami lapped fast and hard at Ryo-ohki, who&#39;s purring was vibrating 
all four of them straight to orgasm. Sasami came first this time, 
moaning into Ryo-ohki. Mihoshi was next, soaking the princess 
thoroughly. Then Ryo-ohki yowled, bucking on Sasami&#39;s face, almost 
suffocating her.
  Washu smiled from below. &quot;You aren&#39;t forgetting about me are you?&quot;
  All three of the other girls were shaking, but they quickly 
disengaged and pounced on Washu. Ryo-ohki pushed her onto her back and 
bit down hard on her right breast, immediately drawing blood and a 
groan from Washu. Mihoshi, after a brief glance to make sure she was 
all right, attacked the other one, wrapping her hands around it and 
squeezing the bruises Sasami&#39;s foot had made. Sasami herself pushed 
Washu&#39;s legs wide open and used her left hand to open up the dripping 
pussy to the cool air. Watching it twitch and open to her easily she 
took her cue from the others and decided to go all out.
  Washu&#39;s eyes widened in shock when she felt Sasami&#39;s entire arm push 
inside her up to the wrist. Tiny fingers rubbed inside her and her 
aching pussy clenched around, pulling Sasami in deeper. The princess 
was onto too happy to comply. Making a fist inside of Washu she shoved 
in deeper, rubbing her knuckles roughly into the walls of Washu&#39;s 
pussy. &quot;Oh god! Ah!&quot; Washu&#39;s hips buckled and Sasami began to piston 
her arm. &quot;Yes! Yes! Yeeeeees!&quot; She felt herself close around the arm 
so tightly that Sasami couldn&#39;t pull out.
  &quot;I&#39;m stuck!&quot; Sasami said.
  Letting go Mihoshi and Ryo-ohki slid down and helped tug her free. 
Her arm slid out with a wet popping noise, covered with Washu&#39;s come. 
All three of them stared at the open pussy before them.
  &quot;Well clean me off.&quot; Washu panted.
  As one the three girls began licking at Washu, moving over her body 
in an attempt to give her a full tongue bath. Washu came two more 
times while this happened, covering them again. The next thing they 
knew they were all licking and kissing each other, not being too picky 
about where or who.
  Nearly an hour later they all simply lay there, too tired to move, 
parts of them throbbing in dull aches that each wished would never go 
away. Ryo-ohki had transformed back to her normal form and curled up 
between Sasami&#39;s small breasts that were now criss-crossed with 
fingernail and claw marks. The others all had similar marks, though 
Washu&#39;s and Ryo-ohki&#39;s had already all but vanished. Absently Washu 
raised her hand and mumbled something to the air. Large nightshirts 
appeared on each of the humanoids. Mihoshi&#39;s was pink with a pattern 
of red kisses, Washu&#39;s was red and read &quot;Best scientist ever&quot;, and 
Sasami wore a pink one the same shade as the underwear Washu had taken 
from her the other day. Washu passed out with the others at that exact 
moment.
  Just then the door opened, bathing them in bright light. &quot;See Ryoko? 
I told you they were fine. They probably just ducked in here when you 
two were fighting and decided to make it a sleep over.&quot;
  &quot;I just felt weird.&quot; Ryoko said. &quot;Not bad, just weird.&quot;
  &quot;Well thank you for your concern for my sister Miss Ryoko, but next 
time don&#39;t jump to conclusions.&quot;
  &quot;Well sorry Aeka, but when I marry Tenchi she&#39;ll be my aunt too and 
if I want to worry about her I will.&quot;
  &quot;When you what? You listen hear Ryoko...&quot; Tenchi shut the door 
quickly but softly so that they wouldn&#39;t wake up.
  And lying on wet pillows, surrounded by her lovers, the second 
princess of Jurai smiled and nuzzled nearby warm flesh, her dreams 
untroubled by worries or cares.

The end

Author&#39;s note
  Yes, it was a Sasami lemon. The girl is seven hundred years old. I 
didn&#39;t even start this story. Another guy, who never finished it, 
wrote it. Why did I finish it? Because I haven&#39;t done this before and 
probably never will again, but I always feel that if you can&#39;t bring 
yourself to write ANYTHING then you are seriously limiting yourself. I 
know pedophilia is wrong. I don&#39;t recommend sex with kids and frankly 
the whole idea turns me off. But the thing you have to remember above 
all else is that these people aren&#39;t real. As far as this universe is 
concerned they&#39;re cartoons. So I don&#39;t want to hear any crap about the 
sexual content. You want to comment either tell me what you liked or 
disliked about the story itself and the writing style. One complaint 
about the sex stuff in any way besides something I may have put in 
that is physically impossible, and I&#39;ll flush your email right then. </pre>
