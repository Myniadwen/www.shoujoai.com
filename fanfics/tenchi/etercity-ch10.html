<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 10 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>        Minako Aino made her way out of the Palace that afternoon 
quietly, using skills that she had honed over centuries of undercover 
work. She rode on the maglev rather than taking a car, knowing that 
any personal vehicles could be easily traced, and also switched 
compartments to throw off any possible pursuers.

        It wasn&#39;t really necessary for her to do all of that, of 
course. She wasn&#39;t on a mission, there wasn&#39;t anything at all covert 
about what she was going out to do today, but she liked to keep in 
practice none the less.

        Minako passed the police center, smiling a bit at the bustle 
of the place. It was a bit of a blessing and a curse that Crystal 
Tokyo still needed a police force. It indicated that a outlaw spirit 
still existed in humanity, and personally she thought that was a good 
thing.

        The monument wasn&#39;t far from the police station itself, a 
garden of green, one of many in the city. It was deserted, like 
always, and Minako felt a sudden flash of irritation at that. &#39;It was 
a long time ago,&#39; she reminded herself firmly, &#39;it&#39;s perfectly 
understandable. Besides, this place is really just intended for those 
of... a certain brotherhood.&#39;

        Minako followed the green path inward, past statues of events 
over the past centuries. The Police memorial garden had quite a few 
monuments, erected in honor of those who had fallen doing their duty. 
What she was looking for stood in the center of the sprawling green, a 
monument built in Mega-Tokyo hundreds of years ago and moved as Tokyo 
itself moved.

        A massive battle mover stood in behind the group, a plain 
clothes officer on one side, a fully outfitted officer on the other. 
And standing in the middle, an intense expression on her face, an 
older woman stood proud and ready beside them.

        The inscription was a simple one: &quot;AD Police Headquarters, 
2051.&quot;

        &quot;Hello Natsuna,&quot; Minako smiled up at her lover&#39;s likeness 
sadly, &quot;it&#39;s been awhile.&quot;

        As she looked up at her face, Minako wondered what Natsuna 
would have thought of the statue of her and the others. She thought 
that Natsuna wouldn&#39;t have minded too much, being a police commander 
had taught her that people needed things like this, symbols.

        Minako sat down on a nearby bench, &quot;I&#39;m not even sure why I 
came out here, today. I know that your body is long gone and your 
spirit at rest.&quot;

        There was a long stretch of silence as Minako sat back, &quot;I&#39;ve 
gotten to know someone at work. She&#39;s tough, irreverent, and doesn&#39;t 
let me get away with anything.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;Even though she is 
supposed to be working for me.&quot;

        Minako could almost imagine the question, &quot;Her name is Major 
Motoko Kusanagi.&quot; A shaky breath, &quot;I&#39;ve asked her out to dinner 
tonight, one of our first away from work.&quot; She got up, looking up at 
the statue with a sad smile.

        &quot;I guess why I came here today,&quot; Minako said softly, &quot;is to 
tell you that I&#39;m finally letting you go. I can&#39;t grieve for you 
forever, I have to get on with my life.&quot; She wiped at a glittering 
tear, &quot;And I think you&#39;d want me to be happy again.&quot;

        As Minako left the memorial the breeze caressed her cheek, and 
for a fanciful moment she thought of a farewell kiss to the cheek. 
&quot;Goodbye, Natsuna.&quot;

        Motoko smiled slightly as she walked over to the Locket. She 
was in her business woman look, sleekly dressed, auburn hair styled, 
and a face like her usual but a bit more refined, somehow.

        The Puma sisters were doing bouncer duty tonight, something 
that stuck her as oddly amusing. With a smile Motoko asked, &quot;Paying 
off a bar tab again?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Anna nodded, &quot;and was that ever mean!&quot;

        Uni nodded agreement, &quot;Leona wouldn&#39;t even pay off our tab for 
us!&quot;

        &quot;Considering all the hot lesbian sex we&#39;ve been giving her,&quot; 
Anna pouted, &quot;you&#39;d think she&#39;d be a bit more grateful.&quot;

        &quot;But we&#39;ll get her tonight,&quot; Uni and Anna exchanged devilish 
looks.

        Motoko gave them a wave as she went inside, &quot;I don&#39;t think I 
want to know.&quot; She had visited the Locket before with this face, and 
was glad to be recognized. It would help her build up this cover 
identity&#39;s background a bit.

        Ruri wasn&#39;t on greeter duty tonight, she must have been on 
space duty again. Instead, Yuri was there beaming happily. &quot;Hi, 
ma&#39;am,&quot; she waved, &quot;welcome to the Locket.&quot;

        &quot;You and Kei becoming regular employees?&quot; Motoko raised an 
eyebrow.

        &quot;I&#39;m in tonight as a favor to Ruri,&quot; Yuri explained. She 
nodded to the interior, &quot;Mahoro is cooking tonight, so of course it&#39;s 
great. Priss is filling in behind the bar, and it turn&#39;s out she&#39;s 
pretty good at slinging drinks.&quot;

        &quot;And what&#39;s Urd doing?&quot; Motoko asked, knowing that where Priss 
went, Urd followed.

        Yuri winced, &quot;Right now, bad kareoke.&quot;

        Motoko smiled to herself slightly at the warmth and 
familiarity of the place. It was nice to have a bar around where you 
could go away for nearly a hundred years and come back to find that 
little had changed. The music was up to date, of course, and the bar 
kept up on current drinks. The library was a mix of real books, reader 
disks, old CD ROM&#39;s, memory crystal and every other kind of data 
storage over the last thousand years. But the heart of the place, what 
made it Arisugawa&#39;s Locket, never seemed to change.

        &quot;Hey, Priss,&quot; Motoko gave her a nod.

        Smoothly Priss prepared a rum and synthetic oil for her, &quot;Hey, 
Major. How&#39;s it going?&quot;

        &quot;Could you at least pretend not to recognize me?&quot; Motoko 
smiled wryly. She looked around, &quot;Is Minako here yet?&quot;

        &quot;Corner table,&quot; Priss nodded to a dark corner where the blonde 
was sitting. She cleaned a glass casually, &quot;You two are..?&quot;

        &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to see,&quot; Motoko answered cautiously. Drink 
in hand she cut across the crowd, smiling slightly at Urd&#39;s singing. 
&#39;She&#39;s not that bad,&#39; she admitted. &quot;Good evening,&quot; Motoko smiled down 
at Minako gently.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad you made it,&quot; Minako nodded, having seen the Major 
in this body before. As Motoko took a seat she took a sip of her 
drink, &quot;What should I call you?&quot;

        &quot;Motoko is fine,&quot; she smiled. She looked across at Minako for 
a moment, &quot;You know, I think this is the first time we&#39;ve met outside 
of business.&quot;

        &quot;I guess I was worried that if we became friends, it might 
develop into something more,&quot; Minako admitted quietly.

        Motoko took a sip of her drink, &quot;So what&#39;s changed?&quot;

        &quot;I realized I can&#39;t live in the past forever,&quot; Minako smiled 
slightly.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Motoko reached over to lay her warm hand over 
Minako&#39;s, &quot;because I&#39;ve been trying to get you to notice me for ages.&quot;

        Minako blushed, &quot;Gee, thanks.&quot;
