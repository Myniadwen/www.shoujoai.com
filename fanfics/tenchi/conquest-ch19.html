<h1>Conquest (part 19 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>        There was a moment of stunned disbelief on the bridge of the 
Swordbreaker as Mitsuki&#39;s fighter exploded into a wash of flame on the 
viewscreen. &quot;Asuka,&quot; Minagi barked out the order, &quot;did she make it 
out?&quot;

        From the tactical station Asuka worked her sensors frantically 
but had to report, &quot;No lifesigns registering, ma&#39;am.&quot;

        Rei spoke softly as she tried to use the communications gear 
to contact her, &quot;Mitsuki, please respond. Mitsuki, if you can pick up 
this signal, please reply...&quot;

        &quot;Is she... &quot; Sasami said weakly, &quot;she couldn&#39;t be...&quot;

        Misaki began to cry softly, even as Funaho put her arm over 
her shoulder. &quot;She may have ejected in time,&quot; she reassured her 
gently.

        Rhione turned around, leaving the bridge silently.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t want to loose anyone this time,&quot; Ryouko murmured to 
herself softly. Standing on Ryo-Ohki&#39;s bridge her expression was 
serious as she asked, &quot;Ryo-Ohki, have all the remaining Terran ships 
retreated back to Earth?&quot;

        &quot;Myah,&quot; Ryo-Ohki picked up her mood as she answered softly.

        &quot;It appears so,&quot; Ayeka agreed, &quot;they&#39;ve suffered serious 
losses in ships.&quot; There was a moment of silence, &quot;Do you want to tell 
Kiyone about...?&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Ryouko sighed, &quot;but I&#39;d better be the one, just because 
of how long we&#39;ve known each other.&quot; She spoke up, &quot;Connect us to 
Swordbreaker.&quot;

        A moment later Minagi&#39;s grim face appeared on the viewscreen. 
&quot;I&#39;ve got the fighters out on patrol in case the Terrans try something 
else,&quot; she reported to her sister seriously, &quot;as well as performing a 
search pattern.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re heading down to the Moon Kingdom itself,&quot; Ryouko 
informed her, &quot;to get a idea of the over all situation.&quot; She paused 
uncomfortably before adding, &quot;And I&#39;ll let Kiyone know about Mitsuki 
being missing.&quot;

        Minagi nodded grimly, &quot;Thanks. We&#39;ll keep on looking.&quot;

        &quot;Please,&quot; Ryouko said softly. The connection closed as Ryouko 
said to Ayeka softly in explanation, &quot;Minagi and I, we&#39;ve always tried 
to at least bring a body home for the grieving family.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s little chance she&#39;s alive?&quot; Ayeka softly asked even 
as Ryouko gave Ryo-Ohki the order to descend to the Moon.

        Ryouko&#39;s expression was grave, &quot;Not much. Even if she ejected 
before the explosion, there&#39;s decompression to deal with. The flight 
suits provide some protection, but...&quot;

        Ayeka nodded grimly. Changing the subject, &quot;Why would Earth 
launch an attack on the Moon Kingdom? From my research, they&#39;ve been 
peaceful neighbors for centuries.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ryouko said grimly, &quot;but I intend to find out. 
And discover what they&#39;ve got to do with the attack on our wedding, 
too.&quot;

        They set down in the courtyard outside the Palace, Ryo-Ohki 
smoothly reverting to her cabbit form. They barely had a chance to 
sort themselves out when a blonde came running out, her long hair 
streaming behind her in two tails.

        &quot;Ryouko,&quot; Queen Serenity threw her arms around the Empress 
then burst into loud tears, &quot;thank you so much!&quot; Before Ayeka could 
muster any objection the weeping queen threw her arms around Ayeka, 
too.

        &quot;You&#39;re people?&quot; Ryouko asked softly.

        &quot;We&#39;ve been quite fortunate,&quot; Serenity let Ayeka go 
reluctantly, &quot;there&#39;s been only a few casualties.&quot; Her expression 
darkened, &quot;We saw one of your fighters destroyed.&quot;

        &quot;We haven&#39;t confirmed the pilot&#39;s status,&quot; Ayeka said softly, 
&quot;but...&quot;

        Serenity turned to signal one of the young men standing guard, 
&quot;Jadite?&quot; The blonde threw a salute as she continued, &quot;Organize search 
parties. If the pilot was near enough to the surface when the ship 
exploded, he or she might still be alive.&quot;

        They walked into the Palace together as Ryouko asked, &quot;What 
started all this?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not entirely certain myself,&quot; Serenity admitted softly. 
They passed through a reception area, &quot;We had good relations with the 
last Terran king, Endymion, but for some reason the latest king seemed 
to bear a grudge against the Kingdom.&quot;

        They entered the command center, where Lady Ami of Mercury, 
Washu, and Yume were working on bringing the systems back on-line. The 
blue haired lady bowed, &quot;Defensive shields are back on line, mostly 
due to Washu and Yume&#39;s expert assistance.&quot;

        &quot;Could you give Ryouko and the others an update on the 
tactical situation?&quot; Serenity asked.

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Ami slipped her glasses on, &quot;the Terrans launched 
their attack almost as soon as we returned home from your wedding, 
using a degree of military power that we were unaware they had 
possessed.&quot;

        &quot;The cloaking devices,&quot; Washu murmured, &quot;they must have used 
them to get the warships past your sensors.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s my theory,&quot; Ami quietly agreed. She turned back to 
Ryouko and Ayeka, &quot;They maintained a blockade to keep us from getting 
word out, then attempted to reduce our defenses.&quot;

        Serenity looked curious, &quot;With that blockade still in place, 
how did you get word that we needed assistance?&quot;

        &quot;We were able to rummage through the cloaked attackers 
navigation computers,&quot; Yume spoke up, &quot;and traced them back to Terra.&quot;

        &quot;Terra knew they wouldn&#39;t stand a chance against our fleet,&quot; 
Ayeka murmured, &quot;why would they risk launching a strike against us?&quot;

        &quot;They were probably counting on their strike to succeed,&quot; Ami 
quietly pointed out, &quot;if they had managed to slay either you or 
Ryouko, the Empire would have been thrown into chaos, it possibly 
could have started up a civil war.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t think I like this Terran king very much,&quot; Ryouko 
scowled, &quot;what&#39;s his name?&quot;

        &quot;We don&#39;t know his birth name,&quot; Serenity said, &quot;but he calls 
himself Tenchi.&quot;

        &quot;Tenchi?!&quot; Ayeka looked surprised, &quot;That was the name of my 
brother Yosho&#39;s sword.&quot;

        &quot;An interesting coincidence,&quot; Yume noted.

        &quot;I&#39;m not so sure I believe in coincidence anymore,&quot; Lady Rei 
of Mars remarked as she entered the chamber. Long black hair flowed 
over her shoulders, and her eyes sparked a fiery red.

        Serenity looked at her, and from the sudden sparkle in her eye 
it was clear she cared deeply for this intense woman. &quot;Have you 
learned something more?&quot; she asked her softly.

        Rei&#39;s face was softened for a moment by a gentle smile 
directed to the queen, then she turned to Ryouko and the others. &quot;It 
seems that this &#39;Tenchi&#39; claims to be a lost prince to the Juraian 
throne,&quot; she explained grimly, &quot;and has convinced much of the Earth he 
is the true heir.&quot;

        &quot;All right, now I&#39;m certain that I don&#39;t like this Terran king 
very much,&quot; Ryouko said grimly. She looked over at Ayeka, &quot;It looks 
like we&#39;re going to have to take steps.&quot;

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; Ayeka agreed.

        Rei and Serenity exchanged a glance, then Serenity spoke up 
firmly, &quot;We&#39;ll offer whatever assistance we can. I have no wish to 
remain neighbors with such a hostile force.&quot; With a slightly rueful 
smile she added, &quot;Sadly, at this point our assistance doesn&#39;t amount 
to much.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll take what we can get,&quot; Ryouko was looking quite 
thoughtful, already considering the overall situation. She shook 
herself once she noticed the odd looks she was getting, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

        &quot;I remember how you work, warlord,&quot; Rei smiled slightly, &quot;and 
I look forward to seeing what you come up with.&quot; She offered her hand 
to Serenity, &quot;Shall we leave them to it, Usagi?&quot;

        A slight blush colored Serenity&#39;s cheeks as she said, &quot;Of 
course.&quot; She took the lady&#39;s hand, and they left the chamber with 
remarkable haste.

        &quot;Usagi?&quot; Ayeka raised an eyebrow, &quot;Wasn&#39;t that what she asked 
you to call her?&quot;

        Ryouko nodded slightly, &quot;Only Serenity&#39;s most intimate 
friends, or lover, is allowed to call her that.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;Rei 
is a lucky woman.&quot;

        &quot;Do you miss it?&quot; Ayeka asked softly, not an accusation but 
merely a question.

        &quot;No,&quot; Ryouko shook her head as she reached out to take Ayeka&#39;s 
hand in hers, &quot;because I&#39;m a luckier woman by far.&quot;

        &quot;Charmer,&quot; Ayeka smiled fondly.

        Washu cleared her throat loudly, &quot;Could we get to work, 
please?&quot;

        Just then Kiyone walked into the chamber. The black haired 
officer instantly knew something was wrong, &quot;What happened?&quot;

        Ryouko sighed softly, &quot;It&#39;s about Mitsuki...&quot;

        That evening Minagi felt a flash of irritation as she and a 
few other crew disembarked on the Moon&#39;s surface to attend a victory 
banquet. &quot;A banquet,&quot; she growled, &quot;we haven&#39;t even won this yet.&quot;

        Ruri gave her a calmly assessing look, &quot;You&#39;re angry because 
we haven&#39;t found Mitsuki yet, not because of any banquet.&quot;

        &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have let her go out in that fighter,&quot; Minagi 
growled.

        &quot;And if you hadn&#39;t,&quot; Ruri pointed out to her coolly, &quot;the 
Palace we&#39;re walking up to would be a smoking crater right now.&quot;

        &quot;A great comfort to her family and friends,&quot; Minagi scowled.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Ruri said intensely, &quot;because she was living her life 
the way she wanted to. Her own choices brought her to that moment, not 
yours.&quot; A moment of silence, &quot;You can not change the past Captain, not 
even you have that power.&quot;

        &quot;Hmm,&quot; Minagi was nodding slightly. &quot;Have you ever considered 
becoming a captain yourself?&quot; she asked Ruri suddenly.

        Ruri looked up to see if the woman was kidding or not. &quot;No,&quot; 
she answered simply.

        &quot;You might want to think about it,&quot; Minagi commented as they 
passed through the outer gates and inside.

        Upon seeing the hostess and guests Minagi felt just a bit 
better, seeing black armbands being worn by almost everyone. Probably 
in honor of their own losses, too, but she felt comforted that the 
dead were being remembered tonight as well.

        Ryouko and Ayeka made their way through the crowd to their 
side. Ryouko smiled grimly, &quot;Good to see you, sis. You too, Commander 
Ruri.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; the blue haired, almost elven woman nodded 
slightly. Ruri looked up at them thoughtfully, &quot;Any news on ..?&quot;

        &quot;Nothing,&quot; Ayeka shook her head before adding grimly, &quot;They&#39;ve 
found the wreckage, but haven&#39;t positively identified her yet.&quot;

        Serenity made her way to the four woman, and nodded 
respectfully to Minagi. &quot;I understand that the pilot that saved the 
Palace was launched from your ship,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I hope that you 
will pass on my deepest regrets to her family.&quot;

        Minagi nodded, &quot;I will.&quot;

        &quot;That won&#39;t be necessary,&quot; a firm and very recognizable voice 
came from the doorway not too far from where they stood. Mitsuki 
leaned on the shoulder of a dark haired young woman, looking a 
complete mess except for the broad grin on her face. Her hair was 
stubble, seemingly burned away, and her uniform was in tatters, blood 
staining the fabric. But strangely, her body appeared whole beneath 
the wrecked uniform, her wounds healed.

        &quot;Mitsuki!&quot; Minagi was across the room and joyfully pounding on 
the redhead&#39;s shoulders like a shot, &quot;You&#39;re alive!&quot;

        &quot;Of course I&#39;m alive,&quot; Mitsuki nearly fell over except for the 
dark haired girl bracing her upright, &quot;I couldn&#39;t hurt this bad if I 
was dead.&quot;

        &quot;Go easy,&quot; the girl scolded Minagi, &quot;she was gravely wounded 
when we found her. If not for my healing gift, I don&#39;t know if she 
would have survived.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you very much,&quot; Ryouko stepped up to say. She smiled 
slightly, &quot;Lady Hotaru of Saturn, am I correct?&quot;

        Hotaru nodded slightly, &quot;Yes I am.&quot;

        &quot;Know that Ryouko, Empress of Manticore owes you a debt. Call 
on me, and I will answer,&quot; she said to the young woman firmly.

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Hotaru smiled slightly, surrendering the 
slightly scorched Mitsuki to their care. She walked away, but was soon 
met by a pink haired girl who clasped the slightly older Hotaru&#39;s hand 
in her own.

        Kiyone looked into Mitsuki&#39;s eyes, and the redhead was 
surprised to see tears glistening, &quot;Don&#39;t you ever do something that 
stupid again.&quot;

        Mitsuki smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;ll try not to.&quot;

        A figure made her way through the crowd, cutting across to 
where they stood. Rhione had the oddest look on her face as she gazed 
at Mitsuki thoughtfully. Softly she said, &quot;I&#39;m glad to see that you&#39;re 
all right.&quot; She looked her over, &quot;Well, mostly all right.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Mitsuki smiled back slightly. She looked over at 
Ryouko, &quot;So, what did I miss?&quot;
