<h1>Alliance (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rann.html">Rann Aridorn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/alliance-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Do not try my patience any further!&quot; Princess Ayeka of the Juraian 
Empire growled, standing and slamming a hand against the tabletop, 
stabbing a finger across the table at her current object of vexation. 
&quot;It will be as I say or it will not be at all!&quot;

Princess Ryoko of the Hyurodan stood up as well, golden eyes flashing 
as she shot back, &quot;That&#39;d be fine enough with me, y&#39;know! I&#39;d just as 
soon go back to my own life without having to put up with YOUR crap!&quot;

&quot;How dare you speak to me that way?!&quot; Ayeka cried, clenching her fist.

&quot;Ladies, ladies!&quot; Queen Washu spoke up, waving her hands. &quot;Calm down!&quot;

&quot;We can have both kinds of flowers at your wedding,&quot; Empress Funaho 
agreed with solemnity.

&quot;They won&#39;t go together at ALL!&quot; Ayeka wailed in dismay.

&quot;For once Princess Prude is right, they&#39;d look terrible!&quot;

&quot;How dare you degenerate to childish name-calling! I won&#39;t stand for 
it!&quot;

Washu, looking somewhat frustrated, flopped back in her chair and 
pinched the bridge of her nose between two fingers. Noticing that even 
Funaho seemed to be becoming annoyed with the princess&#39; bickering, she 
leaned over and murmured, &quot;Why don&#39;t we just go in the next room and 
work this out ourselves, and leave these two to fight?&quot;

Funaho seemed to consider it, glancing at the heating argument, before 
nodding. &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll hurt each other. Much. And since it&#39;s 
an arranged marriage, they might as well accept an arranged wedding.&quot;

Gathering up the various papers and arrangments, the older women 
quietly departed to the next room, though Ryoko and Ayeka would most 
likely not have noticed them had they been accompanied by a full 
marching band.

&quot;-good taste if it dropped on your shameless head!&quot;

&quot;Better to be shameless than to be so repressed you&#39;re a bitch!&quot;

&quot;BITCH?!&quot; Apparently, Ryoko had once again crossed the line, and Ayeka 
launched herself across the table, getting a firm grip on the other 
woman&#39;s long ears and pulling. Ryoko yowled in pain, then grabbed both 
of Ayeka&#39;s ponytails in one hands and yanking repeatedly, Ayeka 
yelping every time.

After a few moments of this, both tried shifting their positions and 
wound up rolling around atop the table, attempting to punch and kick, 
their flailing and close quarters making it nearly impossible to get 
in any seriously damaging blows. Most of the casualties seemed to be 
the table settings and an occassional ripping cloth sound.

Preceded by the sound of giggling and a small, fuzzy brown animal 
running in, Sasami entered the room and paused, brought up short by 
the sounds of violence. She and Ryo-Ohki stared at the fighting girls 
for a minute, before Sasami simply shook her head and looked down at 
the cabbit. &quot;I think they like it.&quot;

&quot;Mya mya,&quot; the cabbit agreed, before scurrying off again, leading the 
young princess behind her.

After almost half an hour, Ayeka and Ryoko broke off their fight, more 
from exhaustion than anything else. Both lay out on their backs on the 
table, heads side-by-side, cheeks flushed with exertion and chests 
heaving.

&quot;You... really are... most difficult,&quot; Ayeka panted.

&quot;Just wait... &#39;til you... marry me,&quot; Ryoko replied in kind, grinning 
maliciously. &quot;Then... we&#39;ll be... living together.&quot;

&quot;Not if... I have anything... to say about it.&quot; Ayeka huffed, 
leveraging herself into a sitting position and checking her kimono, 
scowling at a rip in the shoulder.

&quot;What? The marriage, or living together?&quot; Ryoko sat up as well. Her 
own garmen had fared worse, being of less layers and much shorter, but 
she seemed unconcerned at the generous amount of skin she was showing. 
Indeed, she leaned back on her hands, letting her back arch a bit, 
threatening to make her breasts pop right out of the lowered neckline 
of her minikimono top.

&quot;... Living together,&quot; Ayeka allowed after a moment, carefully 
avoiding looking at Ryoko and slipping off of the table to stand up. 
&quot;It seems futile at this point to oppose the marriage, but as it is 
for political reasons, there is no need for us to actually share 
living quarters.&quot;

&quot;Be kinda hard on the kids though, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; Ryoko replied with a 
smirk.

&quot;... What children?&quot; Ayeka asked, starting to get very nervous, and 
turning suspicious pink eyes towards her fiance.

&quot;Why, ours, of course!&quot; Ryoko exclaimed cheerfully. &quot;Whole buncha cute 
little rugrats, runnin&#39; around, gettin&#39; underfoot, making sleep 
impossible! Oh, and let&#39;s not forget what they&#39;ll do to your figure, 
but hey, them&#39;s the breaks, and you might even look cute with a few 
stretch marks...&quot;

Ayeka began to feel very faint again, and barely murmured a habitual 
&#39;excuse me&#39; before rushing from the room to the sound of Ryoko&#39;s 
howling laughter.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;That WOMAN!&quot; Ayeka raged as she stalked back and forth, having calmed 
enough to be suitably outraged. Kiyone sat on the bed, quietly using 
needle and thread to repair the rents in Ayeka&#39;s kimono, keeping her 
eyes downcast and only adding the occassional &quot;Yes, my lady&quot; when it 
seemed warranted. &quot;Though to call her a woman is to insult women 
everywhere! That mongrel thing! She should be tied up and exiled to 
someplace where she can&#39;t bother civilized people!&quot;

&quot;Yes, my lady.&quot;

&quot;Saying we would have CHILDREN! The very idea is absurd and 
preposterous! Me, having children with her! Even if we weren&#39;t both 
women, I would never, ever consent to procreate with that vicious 
harridan!&quot;

&quot;Yes, my lady.&quot;

&quot;... Kiyone, are you paying attention?!&quot;

&quot;Yes, my lady.&quot;

&quot;Good, because there&#39;s a lot of other things that I have to say about 
Ryoko!&quot;

&#39;As if you&#39;ve talked about anything else since you met her,&#39; Kiyone 
thought, trying to keep herself focused on her work. &#39;The past two 
days it&#39;s been &quot;Ryoko&#39;s doing this&quot; and &quot;Ryoko said that&quot;. Even if you 
really did despise her, it&#39;s a little much time to spend thinking 
solely about her, Ayeka.&#39; The lady-in-waiting heaved a small sigh, 
knowing that her mistress was too involved in her ranting to notice. 
&#39;And once you&#39;re married, Ryoko will probably discharge me,&#39; she 
thought glumly.

&quot;-and another thing!&quot; Ayeka huffed, apparently quite ready to continue 
her tirade, only to be interrupted by a knock at the door. Seeming 
somewhat at a loss for a moment, Ayeka tried to switch from rant mode 
to propriety, just in case it was anyone BUT Ryoko at the door. 
&quot;Enter.&quot;

The door opened, and Misaki poked her head in tentatively. &quot;Um... 
Ayeka, may we talk?&quot;

Ayeka could see that her mother was wary of being screamed at again, 
and felt a heavy twinge of guilt for her behavior that night... even 
if it had perhaps been warranted. She nodded, allowing contrition to 
show on her face. &quot;Please, Mother, come in.&quot;

Misaki slipped into the room, looking at Kiyone. The green-haired girl 
nodded, silently gathering up her work and leaving the room. Once the 
Empress was alone with her daughter, she smiled tentatively.

&quot;How are you, Ayeka...?&quot;

&quot;... Rather furious with Ryoko as usual, Mother.&quot;

&quot;... But not with me?&quot;

Ayeka let out a long breath. &quot;It was... inappropriate, what you did, 
Mother. I was NOT,&quot; that most emphatically. &quot;Having sex with Ryoko. 
Even if I were, I do not think... I would be comfortable having you 
watching.&quot;

&quot;Certainly, and I&#39;m very sorry,&quot; Misaki replied quickly, before 
hurrying to give Ayeka one of the rib-compressing hugs she was 
infamous for. Once she had set her daughter down and the princess had 
caught her breath back, Misaki continued. &quot;Darling, I really think you 
should try to get along with Princess Ryoko! You&#39;ve already gotten off 
to a poor start, but it&#39;s not too late!&quot;

&quot;A... poor start?&quot; Ayeka grated, that tick in her eye returning.

&quot;Yes, but things can still improve!&quot; Misaki continued brightly, taking 
no notice of her daughter&#39;s spasming muscles. &quot;Your father and I were 
arranged to be married and had no choice in the matter, but we still 
love one another dearly! But we had to work at it, and if we&#39;d worked 
at it sooner in our relationship, things might have been better 
earlier on.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but neither you nor father were... like that!&quot; Ayeka cried, 
waving in a random direction, as if Ryoko were right there to be 
gestured at as an example of all that was vile.

&quot;Oh, I was a little rough around the edges, myself,&quot; Misaki said with 
a smile, eyes taking on a far-off look. &quot;I was just barely of noble 
birth, out on a little colony world, but it was determined I should 
marry the prince. It really was romantic!&quot;

Sighing, Ayeka simply fell back into a convenient chair, considering 
fully giving in to despair. &#39;My mother doesn&#39;t understand me and I&#39;m 
in a terrible relationship. No other young woman in the universe could 
have such problems...&#39;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;She really is a bitchy little prude,&quot; Ryoko growled, floating back 
and forth in agitation. Washu nodded along as she went over some 
seating arrangements, occassionally giving Ryoko the verbal cues she 
wanted. &quot;It&#39;s great to tease her until she blows up, but she honestly 
is annoying as all hell! It&#39;s funny at first, then I start thinking 
about it, and it&#39;s like a bug that burrows in under my skin and starts 
itching like hell!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re saying she gives you an itch you can&#39;t scratch, then?&quot;

Ryoko paused in midair, legs curled up a bit to avoid dragging her 
feet, and turned to glare at her mother. &quot;Oh, ha ha, very funny. 
You&#39;re just a big old barrel of laughs.&quot; The cyan-haired princess 
resumed her odd form of pacing, a hand on her chin. &quot;If I was just 
horny, I&#39;d go down to the barracks and pick out a guard. Not that 
Ayeka ain&#39;t cute, even if she is kinda small-chested.&quot;

The Hyurodan princess paused in her rant, grinning a bit in the memory 
of those smallish but very nicely-formed breasts heaving with the 
exertion of their fight. Oh, yes, Ayeka definitely had a delightful 
body, if underendowed by typical Hyurodan standards. Ryoko kept 
finding delight in spurring Ayeka on until physical violence broke 
out, their little tussles pleasurable on a number of levels.

&quot;You&#39;ve been floating there with a silly grin on your face for a 
couple of minutes now,&quot; Washu spoke up, smiling. &quot;Why don&#39;t you just 
admit you&#39;re crazy about her?&quot;

Ryoko snorted, lowering her legs and settling on the balls of her 
feet. &quot;Yeah, so maybe I like her a little. She&#39;s got a great little 
bod, and she fights almost as dirty as I do. And when you get her 
mad... her eyes flash with this impending doom that&#39;s enough ta make 
you shiver.&quot; She got that silly grin again for a moment before shaking 
it off and waving a hand. &quot;Eh, but she&#39;s a prude, I don&#39;t do anything 
but piss &#39;er off.&quot;

&quot;You like pissing her off, but I think that&#39;s beside the point, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot; Washu replied, bemused. &quot;You really would like to be on better 
terms with her, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;

Ryoko heaved a sigh, then nodded. &quot;Yeah, I would,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;Then you&#39;re going to have to tone it down.&quot;

The younger woman scowled, hands thumping on her hips. &quot;You know 
that&#39;s not my style. It ain&#39;t me!&quot;

&quot;You can still be yourself and not come onto her all the time or 
insult her.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess,&quot; Ryoko muttered, rubbing the back of her head. &quot;So, 
fine, what would you suggest?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Ayeka looked up from the discussion of possible fabrics for her 
wedding kimono at a knock on the door. Standing and moving to the 
door, Kiyone and Misaki watching curiously, Ayeka opened the door, 
scowling at who was standing on the other side. 

&quot;What do YOU want?&quot; she demanded of Ryoko.

The other princess seemed to bristle, almost literally, her spikey 
hair seeming to raise a little. Then she cleared her throat, locking 
gazes with Ayeka. &quot;I&#39;d like to formally invite you and your family to 
join... my mother and I for dinner tonight.&quot;

Ayeka tried valiantly to keep her jaw from hitting the ground. Not 
only had Ryoko failed to rise to the verbal barb, she had been very 
close to proper in her wording and demeanor. Unsure, the Juraian 
princess merely stammered out an affirmative and exchanged a few 
parting pleasantries before sagging back into the room.

&quot;... That was unexpected.&quot; Ayeka found she had to resist the urge to 
shake, wondering why she&#39;d been unnerved so badly.

&quot;You see? She&#39;s making an effort!&quot; Misaki chirped, standing and moving 
to the closet. &quot;The least you can do is the same! Now, let&#39;s pick you 
out something nice!&quot;

&quot;... Yes, of course.&quot;

Kiyone stared down at the fabric samples she was holding, seeming 
distracted.

&quot;Kiyone? Kiyone! Come here and help me decide!&quot;

Realizing she was being derelict in her duty, Kiyone hurriedly set 
aside the samples and stood, plastering a smile on her face. &quot;Yes, my 
lady! I&#39;m sorry, my mind wandered!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Ryoko floated above the castle&#39;s garden, frowning thoughtfully. She 
remained there for almost an hour before she was interrupted by the 
captain of the guard flying up beside her, her loincloth flapping 
willfully in the breeze, constantly threatening to show whether or not 
she wore anything under it.

&quot;Ryo-chan. What&#39;s up?&quot;

Thinking nothing of the familiarity, Ryoko made a slight hand gesture 
showing she wasn&#39;t in the mood to talk.

&quot;C&#39;mon... you&#39;ve been all distant ever since the Juraian chicks got 
here.&quot; The guard floated closer, arms sliding around the other woman&#39;s 
middle from behind. &quot;You&#39;re all horny, that&#39;s what it is,&quot; she purred. 
&quot;C&#39;mon down to my room, or even just the roof... I&#39;ll give you a good 
massage, and we can fool around some, and you&#39;ll feel a lot better...&quot;

&quot;Dammit, Kallista, I&#39;m not in the mood,&quot; Ryoko grumbled, pushing the 
other woman&#39;s arms open and floating away.

The high guard scowled slightly. &quot;It IS that Ayeka, isn&#39;t it? What, 
you&#39;re hung up on her now? You&#39;ve got a princess, so guards aren&#39;t 
good enough for you anymore?&quot;

&quot;What the hell are we, a couple? I&#39;ve suddenly gotta explain why I do 
or don&#39;t wanna screw ta you?&quot; Ryoko turned in place to glare at her 
sometime lover. &quot;You knew as well as any we were just fooling around 
and nothing more. I&#39;ve never done anything more than just fool around 
with anyone.&quot;

&quot;... Yeah, sorry.&quot; Kallista gave her head a toss, her spiky orange 
hair swaying behind her like a serrated shark fin. &quot;Been a little edgy 
lately. Lot of rumors going around. Wish you&#39;d let me increase your 
guard.&quot;

&quot;I can take care of myself just fine, Kal-chan,&quot; Ryoko replied, 
softening somewhat, floating back over and giving the guardswoman a 
nudge on the jaw. &quot;Did for a long time before I ever had a royal 
guard. Doesn&#39;t mean it hasn&#39;t been fun.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Guess so.&quot; The other woman&#39;s light green eyes gazed searchingly 
at Ryoko for long moments, before she nodded slowly. &quot;Still. Take me 
with you when you go to Jurai, okay? Even if ya can take care of 
yourself, I&#39;d sleep better knowing I was around to make sure of it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll talk to mom about it, but yeah, I think that&#39;s doable.&quot; Ryoko 
folded her arms over her chest and gravitated back. &quot;Gotta go now. 
Gonna do some kind of fancy dinner party tonight, means I&#39;ve gotta go 
get all prettied up.&quot; With a little grin, she angled down and swooped 
down to use one of the castle&#39;s many balconies.

Kallista remained above the garden for a while yet, though, gazing off 
across the city as Ryoko had been. After awhile, she simply let out an 
almost angry rush of breath, before murmuring a vague curse and 
turning to fly towards the barracks.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ryoko drew up short as she walked in from the balcony, actually 
lifting off the floor a bit and levitating back to avoid knocking 
Sasami down as the girl ran through the hall. The young princess drew 
back a bit, starting to apologize, then blinked and stared, as if in 
awe. Ryoko started to ask why, then recalled that she had yet to fly 
in front of any of the Juraians. Shrugging it off, she merely smirked 
and settled back onto the floor.

&quot;Hey, better watch out, kiddo, you&#39;ll knock someone over,&quot; she chided 
lightly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Princess Ryoko,&quot; Sasami replied, contrite.

&quot;Just Ryoko&#39;s fine. We&#39;re all royalty here, fiddling with the titles 
doesn&#39;t make any sense.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Sasami blinked a few times, seeming to assimilate that, then 
smiled brightly. &quot;Okay, Ryoko!&quot;

&quot;Mya!&quot; the cabbit chimed in from Sasami&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Ryo-Ohki?&quot; Ryoko murmured, surprised. &quot;I&#39;d wondered where you were.&quot;

&quot;Um... your mom said I could have her,&quot; Sasami replied, as if afraid 
she&#39;d been caught with her hand in the cookie jar. &quot;I tried to say 
that should be your decision, but she said-&quot;

&quot;I can guess what she said,&quot; Ryoko interrupted, though without any 
malice. She smiled a bit. &quot;Well, I guess that&#39;s okay. Though I think 
you had some decisive part in this, you sneaky little furball.&quot;

&quot;Mya! Mya mya mya!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure you didn&#39;t.&quot;

Sasami looked back and forth between the cabbit and the Hyurodan. &quot;You 
can understand what she&#39;s saying?&quot;

&quot;Oh, sure. Give it time, you spend long enough around her, you&#39;ll 
start to understand too. Cabbits are all a little psychic, and once 
they&#39;re around someone long enough, they form enough of a bond to make 
themselves understood pretty clear.&quot; Ryoko stepped to one side, and 
walked past Sasami, giving one of her trademark lazy waves. &quot;Seeya at 
dinner tonight, Sasami.&quot;

&quot;Um, Ryoko, wait,&quot; Sasami called, turning around and hurrying after 
the older girl a few steps.

&quot;Hm?&quot; The cyan-haired woman paused, looking down at the little girl.

&quot;... Are you in love with my sister?&quot; Sasami asked, face earnest and 
almost solemn.

Ryoko fought the urge to laugh at both the question and the adorable 
picture, the little princess hugging one of the galaxy&#39;s cuter 
creatures to her chest. She did give in to the urge to smile, one of 
the few real, honest smiles she&#39;d felt in a long time. Squatting down, 
she rested a hand atop Sasami&#39;s head.

&quot;You know, squirt, just between you and me... and I mean that... I 
just might be.&quot; Then she held up a finger in a shushing motion. &quot;Don&#39;t 
tell anyone, though, okay?&quot;

Sasami giggled, pink eyes shining with an immeasurable amount of 
delight. &quot;Okay. It&#39;ll be our secret!&quot;

&quot;Thanks, kid. If I really am, well, I&#39;d wanna tell her myself, when 
I&#39;m ready.&quot; The smile turned into a somewhat evil smirk. &quot;And just 
when it&#39;d make her flip out the most.&quot;

Sasami started laughing aloud at that, and after a moment, Ryoko 
joined her. And somewhere else in the castle, Ayeka sneezed, and 
wondered why she suddenly had such a feeling of foreboding gathering 
in the corners of her mind.
