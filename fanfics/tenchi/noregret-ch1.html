<h1>No Need for Regrets (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>For Sasami, time seemed to slow to a crawl as Kagato&#39;s clone turned to 
her, his hand raised as a blood red light gathered on the center of 
his palm. He raised his arm, gestured and let the energy bolt fly! 
Sasami didn&#39;t even have the chance to scream as the energy bolt 
sizzled through the air towards her.

But before it could strike, a figure suddenly blurred into existence 
before her! There was a fiery explosion, and Sasami felt something hot 
and wet splash against her cheek as a wave of force pushed her down to 
the floor. The woman standing in front of her swayed then fell 
backward, and Sasami barely caught her before she hit the ground.

Minagi smiled up at Sasami weakly, her labored breath coming in short, 
pain filled gasps. The front of her clothes were a mess of blood and 
torn flesh, but she still managed to bravely smile as she struggled to 
ask her &quot;Are you all right, Sasami?&quot;

&quot;Minagi,&quot; Sasami said, her wide eyes filled with tears, reaching up to 
feel the blood splattered on her cheek &quot;why did you... ?&quot;

Minagi reached up and shushed her, tears leaking from Minagi&#39;s eyes 
and running down onto the groves of her crescent scared cheeks. &quot;I 
think you were my very first friend, did you know that? I&#39;m so glad I 
had the chance to know you,&quot; she said faintly, as her hand dropped 
from Sasami&#39;s face to fall limply at her side. She looked dazedly up 
at Sasami&#39;s tear streaked face, &quot;There&#39;s no need for regrets...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk like that,&quot; Sasami tearfully cried, &quot;you are going to be 
all right!&quot; But Minagi couldn&#39;t hear Sasami&#39;s words, her eyes closing 
with exhaustion, what little strength she had left finally deserting 
her. Tears streaked Sasami&#39;s face as she shook her frantically, 
&quot;Minagi! Minagi, wake up! You&#39;ve got to wake up, please!&quot;

Sasami looked around the battlefield frantically. Tenchi was facing 
Kagato, the Lighthawk Blade shining in his hands, Ryouko and Ayeka 
standing beside him! Nearby them, Mihoshi lay unconscious, being 
tended by Washu. &quot;Washu!&quot; Sasami cried.

Washu looked up, saw the body that Sasami cradled in her arms, and the 
blood seemed to leave her face in a sudden rush. She crossed the 
battlefield as quickly as possible, reaching Minagi&#39;s side in moments. 
As she tore what was left of Minagi&#39;s clothes free, Washu quickly 
asked Sasami &quot;What happened?!&quot;

She examined the wound in disbelief, even as Sasami explained. The 
damage was actually getting worse, somehow Minagi&#39;s wounds were 
actually growing larger in size. &quot;Please Washu,&quot; Sasami said to her 
tearfully, &quot;you have to save her!&quot;

Washu worked frantically as the battle behind them worsened. &quot;I can&#39;t 
do anything for her here,&quot; a frustrated Washu finally admitted, &quot;I 
have to get her back to my lab!&quot; even as she pulled a small device 
from her clothes and activated it above Minagi&#39;s still form.

The force field quickly surrounded Minagi&#39;s still form, and Sasami 
looked down at her in surprise. Within the field, time itself seemed 
to have completely stopped, the bleeding and the growing wounds 
stilled, at least for the moment. The noises of battle stopped in an 
eerie silence, and both gazed up in disbelief...

Tenchi, Ryouko and Ayeka glowed together like a living star, their chi 
energies combined as one, incredible force. The anger and conflict 
that normally marred both Ryouko&#39;s and Ayeka&#39;s faces was gone, 
replaced by a shared purpose as all three of them struck together. The 
clone of Kagato was utterly destroyed, shattered on a molecular level.

Sasami felt a small bit of satisfaction at that, but it was a fleeting 
feeling as Washu tiredly asked her &quot;Please help me carry Minagi over 
to my lab, Sasami.&quot; she looked down at Minagi&#39;s frozen body, &quot;I have a 
long night&#39;s work ahead of me, I think.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Sasami sat at the base of the stairs, her head resting on her knees as 
she waited as patiently as she could manage. The others were all 
scattered around the hallway nearby, hoping for some word of Minagi&#39;s 
condition. Tenchi walked over to her, sitting down on the step beside 
her. &quot;I&#39;m sure Washu can help her,&quot; he tried to reassure Sasami.

&quot;She got hurt protecting me, Tenchi,&quot; Sasami said to him, so quietly 
he could barely hear the words. He leaned closer as she whispered 
hoarsely, tears glinting at the corners of her eyes &quot;I&#39;m not sure what 
I&#39;ll do if she dies...&quot;

Mihoshi only heard the last part and suddenly broke into loud tears! 
&quot;You don&#39;t think she&#39;s going to die, do you?&quot; she asked the others 
tearfully.

&quot;Washu will do everything she can to save her,&quot; Ayeka said to Mihoshi 
firmly, trying to convey confidence in Washu&#39;s abilities.

&quot;But she&#39;s been in there such a long time,&quot; Ryouko said, her voice 
filled with worry. She got up and resumed restlessly pacing the short 
hallway. &quot;If she doesn&#39;t make it, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do,&quot; Ryouko 
sighed.

Just then the door at the base of the stairs opened and a very tired 
looking Washu walked out. She pulled her blood splattered surgical 
gloves off with a loud snap, a bleak expression on her childlike face. 
&quot;Washu,&quot; Tenchi said, sounding honestly worried now, &quot;is Minagi...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s still in the slow-time field,&quot; Washu said to them quietly. 
&quot;Kagato somehow loaded his energy bolt with nanites, tiny machines 
that have invaded Minagi&#39;s body to try to kill her.&quot; She sighed 
tiredly as she continued to explain &quot;The field stops them from making 
things any worse, but it also makes any attempt at treating her 
incredibly difficult!&quot;

&quot;So why can&#39;t you just remove them?&quot; Ryouko demanded angrily. Tenchi 
tried to calm her, but she just shrugged off his touch. Ayeka gave her 
a look, and Ryouko reigned in her temper a bit, to everyone&#39;s 
surprise.

&quot;I tried,&quot; Washu sighed, &quot;but it&#39;s not as easy as it sounds. They&#39;ve 
infiltrated her entire body, so if any of the nanites remain, they can 
reproduce and start doing more damage, and I can&#39;t treat her wounds 
until the nanites are gone!&quot;

Sasami nodded, a unusually grim expression on her face. Ayeka then 
spoke up, &quot;Is there anything we can do to help?&quot;

Washu shrugged, &quot;My lab here has most of what I need. I&#39;ll need to 
ship in some additional medical equipment, so I can both monitor and 
work to destroy the nanites while keeping her in the slow time field.&quot;

&quot;Jurai has some very good medical facilities,&quot; Sasami said 
thoughtfully. &quot;Would they be of help to you, Washu?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Washu admitted, &quot;but I doubt they&#39;d allow...&quot;

Sasami smiled, a cold, harsh smile, and Washu was suddenly reminded of 
the fact that Sasami and Ayeka, despite their pleasant natures, were 
daughters of the Emperor. They were both so nice, she often forgot 
that little fact.

&quot;I think,&quot; Sasami said to her calmly, &quot;if Tenchi, Ayeka and I ask 
them... the right way, we shouldn&#39;t have any problem.&quot;

Washu drew Sasami aside for a moment, &quot;Treating Minagi through the 
slow time field means that curing her will take a very long time, 
Sasami, years or maybe even decades. I need to know I&#39;ll have your 
support, no matter how long it takes.&quot;

&quot;Minagi&#39;s not only my friend,&quot; Sasami said to Washu simply, her 
expression firm, &quot;but she also saved my life. I won&#39;t abandon her.&quot;

On the planet Jurai, the Capital City, sometime much later...

Washu opened the door to the private medical bay, and strode 
confidently into the room. In her adult form she was a tall, busty 
redhead, a form she had chosen to maintain throughout the long years 
they had all spent on Jurai. A small smile appeared on her face as she 
saw the shorter, blue-hared woman who soundly slept in a chair sitting 
by the tall healing tank where Minagi floated, also deeply 
unconscious.

&quot;Sasami,&quot; Washu said to her softly as she shook the young woman&#39;s 
shoulder gently, &quot;it&#39;s time to get up.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Washu,&quot; Sasami said, leaning back in her chair and stretching, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t mean to fall asleep down here.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Washu said smiling as she pulled up a chair herself 
and sat down by Sasami. &quot;I know the long hours we&#39;ve been putting in 
down here are hard on you, young lady,&quot; she said, concern in her 
voice.

Sasami reached up to rub at her eyes sleepily as she asked Washu &quot;How 
are the latest group of test results?&quot;

Washu smiled happily as she said in a very self satisfied tone, &quot;She&#39;s 
clean of the nanites, down to an sub-atomic level!&quot;

Sasami looked over at Washu blankly a moment, as if she couldn&#39;t quite 
believe what she was hearing, then with a shriek of joy she leapt out 
of her chair! She grabbed Washu&#39;s hands and pulled her out of her 
chair and danced her around the room happily. &quot;She&#39;s going to be all 
right!&quot; Sasami cried out tearfully.

Washu staggered back to her chair, out of breath. &quot;Yes,&quot; Washu said 
once she got her breath back, &quot;we&#39;ll be able to wake her up later 
today.&quot; She paused, and looked over worriedly at Sasami. &quot;It&#39;s been 
over a hundred years since she was hurt, Sasami. That&#39;s a lot of time 
for anyone to loose, so I was wondering if you could...&quot;

&quot;Be a guide for her to this new era?&quot; Sasami finished her request. &quot;Of 
course, Washu. I know that as co-wife to the Emperor, you have a lot 
of duties to attend to.&quot; Her face suddenly lit up with one of her 
happy smiles as Sasami said, &quot;All those years ago, if you told me that 
Mihoshi and you would be married to Emperor Tenchi the First, I don&#39;t 
think I would have believed you.&quot;

Washu laughed, &quot;Neither would I!&quot; She shook her head, &quot;I always 
thought that he&#39;d end up with you, honestly.&quot;

The two shared a quiet laugh at that, the sort of laugh that could 
only be shared by long time friends. Sasami had become Washu&#39;s 
unofficial assistant in between her various diplomatic duties. If she 
wasn&#39;t in her quarters or working, you could usually find her in the 
medlab sitting with Minagi. Sometimes she&#39;d talk, or read, or just 
stay there to keep her friend company.

Minagi heard the muted sounds of familiar voices and the soft sound of 
laughter. She slowly felt herself rise back to wakefulness, following 
those sweet sounds to their source. Her eyes gradually opened, and she 
found herself floating in the far too familiar liquid of a healing 
tank. Looking out, she saw two women standing and talking before her.

She instantly recognized Washu, even though she had changed to her 
adult form, but the other woman only looked slightly familiar to 
Minagi&#39;s sleep blurred mind. She reminded Minagi a little of the 
Empress Misaki, as well as the human form Tsunami sometimes used, but 
somehow very different, too. She was more serious in appearance, but 
still seemed to be charmingly innocent and, Minagi found herself 
noticing, quite beautiful.

She floated over to the side of the tank to try and see the light 
blue-hared girl with the violet eyes more clearly, and without meaning 
to gently bumped the inner surface of the tank&#39;s wall. Washu turned, 
her eyes wide, and saw Minagi gazing somewhat dazedly out at them.

&quot;She&#39;s awake!&quot; Washu said, her voice showing her complete surprise. 
&quot;Her recuperative powers are greater than even I thought,&quot; she added 
admiringly. &quot;I am truly the greatest scientific genius in the 
universe!&quot;

Sasami spun around, and found her gaze meeting Minagi&#39;s own. She stood 
totally frozen as Minagi&#39;s green eyes looked into her own, and, Sasami 
felt, into her very soul itself! She stirred, walked slowly to the 
tank and then reached up, her hand laying on one side of the tank 
wall, Minagi&#39;s hand resting on the other as they stood, lost in the 
enchantment of each other&#39;s eyes.

Washu hurried over to the tank&#39;s controls and began to drain the thick 
healing fluid, before turning to gaze upon the two figures standing 
there frozen before her.

&quot;It&#39;s going to be all right, Minagi,&quot; Washu finally felt had to say, 
breaking the spell the girls were under. Sasami took a small step 
back, her cheeks flushed as the fluid drained and the glass wall was 
finally raised to release Minagi back into the outside world again. 
Minagi staggered a bit, and Washu barked &quot;Sasami, grab her other 
side!&quot;

They held Minagi erect, who was looking over at Sasami in a look of 
pure astonishment on her face. &quot;Sasami, is that you?&quot; she asked the 
beautiful young woman standing beside her, holding her arm gently in 
her hands.

Sasami smiled at her, and Minagi recognized that cheerful smile from 
the many times it had been leveled at her before. &quot;Hello, Minagi,&quot; 
Sasami said, tears glinting in her eyes, &quot;you have no idea how good it 
is to see you!&quot; </pre>
