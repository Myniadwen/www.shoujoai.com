<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 25 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>The yellow hardsuit threw itself into the air above
the field behind the crystal tower, the boot thrusters
combining with electromagneticly generated lift to
nearly make the suit fly. It echoed a human&#39;s form,
with a thin shield of technological augmentation over
the body beneath, segmented sections of armor making
up the exteriors. The helmets were rounded, a curve
covering and protecting the face while also providing
a full tactical display.

&quot;As you can see,&quot; Priss Asagiri said to them dressed
in her own blue hardsuit, the helm tucked under her
arm, &quot;the appearance of the suits haven&#39;t changed very
much since the twenty-first century.&quot; The brown haired
woman flashed a grin as she continued, &quot;The
capabilities, on the other had, have changed a lot.&quot;

Right on cue the hardsuit raced towards the waiting
targets set up safely away from the guests, redish
energy flaring all around it&#39;s gauntlets as it threw
one after another energy bolts towards the objects.
Each one was consumed in a blast of fire, leaving
craters where they had stood. Energy bolts lanced
towards the suit only to be stopped nearly a foot from
the suit, dissipating against it&#39;s protective shields.

&quot;This is the kind of power that we&#39;ll be expecting you
to use wisely,&quot; Priss turned back to look at the young
men and women who were visiting there on a student
tour of the facility, &quot;if you&#39;re admitted to the
hardsuit corps.&quot;

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Catrine murmured, the blue haired young
woman looking on in awe.

Erica Tenoh smiled, standing beside her in the middle
of the ten students. She knew that Priss recognized
her but was glad that she wasn&#39;t letting on. &quot;I wonder
who&#39;s in the yellow hardsuit?&quot; the black haired young
woman murmured to Catrine softly.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind knowing that, too,&quot; Hiro said, the
black haired young man standing nearby, his uniform
matching his hair..

&quot;Actually it&#39;s an old friend of mine,&quot; Priss smiled as
the yellow hardsuit smoothly settled down in a landing
beside her, &quot;whom I sort of collared into doing this.&quot;

The woman reached up to remove her helm, revealing
dark blue hair in a short style, along with eyes that
were strikingly intense. Ran Mizuno looked casually
capable dressed in the suit of armor, her smile
clearly amused as she remarked, &quot;And here I was just
trying to catch up with some of my old buddies.&quot;

&quot;Oh my goddess,&quot; Catrine breathed out, the fan of the
Senshi instantly recognizing the young woman who was
standing before them.

&#39;I&#39;ll be damned,&#39; Erica fought back a grin.

As the class began to move on Priss called to them,
&quot;Erica, Catrine, could you hand back for a few
moments?&quot;

Erica could feel Catrine&#39;s nervousness as they walked
over to the two hardsuit pilots and murmured to her,
&quot;Relax.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot; Catrine answered weakly.

Priss looked at Erica thoughtfully a moment, &quot;I was a
liittle surprised to see you on this tour. Have you
reconsidered my offer?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Erica shook her head, the boy&#39;s school
uniform she wore hugging her slim frame, &quot;I&#39;m just
here along with a friend for moral support.&quot;

&quot;Offer?&quot; Ran looked between Priss and Erica curiously.

&quot;I tried out Erica in a hardsuit simulator as a joke a
while back,&quot; Priss said casually, &quot;she beat the
introductory and intermediate programs on her first
try.&quot; She shrugged, &quot;So I asked if she&#39;d be interested
in entering the Hardsuit training program.&quot;

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Erica said to Priss with a smile, &quot;this is
Catrine, she&#39;s the one who&#39;s interested in joining the
Hardsuit Corps.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Catrine squeaked.

With a smile and a smooth manner Priss took Catrine
aside, talking to the young woman and calming her
nerves with practiced ease. Ran smiled as they watched
then softly asked Erica, &quot;Is that the new girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Erica admitted, feeling the beginings of a
blush color her cheeks.

Ran chuckled, watching the girl in the skirt who was
listening so eagerly to Priss. &quot;She looks nice,&quot; she
quietly commented, &quot;though I don&#39;t know if I would
have expected her to be interested in Hardsuit
piloting.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s full of surprises,&quot; Erica said with a grin.
Catrine rejoined them and Erica made the rather
unnecessary introductions.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; Catrine bowed formally.

Ran had to fight back a smile. &quot;You don&#39;t need to do
that,&quot; she said wryly, &quot;I don&#39;t go for that kind of
formality, thanks.&quot;

Erica noted one of the teachers looking back and
smiled wryly, &quot;Looks like we need to catch up with our
class, can we talk later?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll look forward to it,&quot; Ran said as she watched
them go.

Priss and Ran walked away together, heading towards
the Armory rooms. &quot;If I didn&#39;t say it before, thanks
for helping out,&quot; Priss said.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Ran said as they walked into the
facility, light from the crystal matrix walls glinting
off their armor. &quot;I think I missed this, honestly,&quot;
she admitted as they keyed open a steel alloy door,
entering a chamber with several of the armored suits
hanging off wall racks.

&quot;Well, you certainly haven&#39;t lost any of your edge,&quot;
Priss commented as she hung her helm up on the rack.
Smoothly she popped the seals of the suit and climbed
out, easily lifting the light weight armor into it&#39;s
niche.

Ran paused a moment to admire the woman in the skin
tight body suit then firmly reminded herself that she
was taken. &quot;Try being a pilot for the Khanite,&quot; Ran
offered with a smile as she pulled her own armor off,
&quot;you don&#39;t have time to loose any edge.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Priss chuckled. She looked over at
Ran worriedly, &quot;I heard you were injured, piloting the
suit didn&#39;t...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m healed up enought,&quot; Ran reassured her. &quot;Keeping
busy?&quot; she asked as both women got dressed, her in
casual clothing while Priss donned a simple Crystal
Tokyo military uniform.

&quot;The Isolationist crazies are still active,&quot; Priss
made a face as they walked out into the halllway,
&quot;they&#39;ve been hitting space ports and ships,
thankfully unsuccessfully.&quot;

Ran made a face at that and growled, &quot;I can&#39;t believe
that anyone would seriously think we can pull back to
just living on Earth.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve modified their stance since you left,&quot; Priss
corrected, &quot;now they want us just in our solar system,
abandoning all interstellar colonies.&quot;

&quot;Not much of an improvement,&quot; Ran muttered. She looked
thoughtful, &quot;The Khanite, not to mention Jurai or any
of the multi-system governments, would look on that as
a sign of weakness and probably attack us.&quot;

Priss looked surprised as they stepped into the lift,
&quot;You really think Jurai would take a shot at us, even
with Lord Tenchi in charge?&quot;

&quot;I doubt Tenchi would agree,&quot; Ran commented, &quot;but
there&#39;s nothing to stop his border rulers from doing
something that&#39;s officially unauthorized.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t ask you about what the Khanite might do,&quot;
Priss said diplomatically.

They stepped outside, the monorail station waiting to
carry them to the palace. &quot;The Khan has a treaty with
Earth,&quot; she answered, &quot;but that wouldn&#39;t stop him if
he thought there was a chance to win. He respects
strength, and for now Crystal Tokyo has that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll have to think about that,&quot; Priss nodded. She
lightened suddenly and gently slapped Ran on the back
of the head, &quot;And what&#39;s with you hiding out? Urd
wants you over for dinner!&quot;

&quot;Oww,&quot; Ran winced. &quot;All right, all right,&quot; she said as
Priss was readying another slap, &quot;I&#39;ll come over. Just
don&#39;t let me get into another drinking match with her
or Mara.&quot;

Priss snickered, &quot;I warned you at the time.&quot;

&quot;I still remember the hangover I had,&quot; Ran chuckled.</pre>
