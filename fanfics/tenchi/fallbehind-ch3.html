<h1>Fallen Behind (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/fallbehind-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;So, Mom, do you have any idea on how to hunt down Bakari?&quot; Ryoko asked 
as she flopped down into her floating chair, &quot;No, no, wait, let me 
guess.  Since it&#39;s your ship, you made sure to put a trace-lock on it, 
even though you never thought it would be stolen.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re definitely my girl!&quot; Washu laughed, &quot;Yes indeed!  I always put
trace-locks on my ships, just to be safe.  May I?&quot;  Ryoko nodded,
summoning her computer and sliding it over air to her mother.  The 
little mad scientist began to type at top speed, her hands a pink blur
over the keyboard.

&quot;Bingo!&quot; she cackled in her usual fashion after only a minute, &quot;Got 
them.  They&#39;re traveling just under their top speed towards Gasmen.&quot;

&quot;Gasmen?&quot; Ayeka grew pale, &quot;You mean the same planet Gasmen where 
everything illegal is commonplace?  Where killers can be toasted with 
deadly drinks?  That evil pirate is taking my sister to GASMEN?!&quot;

&quot;Well, Bakari always was a booze hound.&quot; Ryoko smirked, &quot;She&#39;s drunk
almost all the time.  She must be going there to stock up on some 
whiskey or something.&quot;

&quot;But she stole the entirety of my father&#39;s private liquor store.&quot; 
Ayeka&#39;s eyes widened in shock, &quot;That&#39;s almost one hundred bottles of 
the universe&#39;s finest alcohol.&quot;

&quot;Uh, miss Ayeka, Bakari drinks a lot in a short amount of time.&quot; Minagi 
seemed embarrassed to speak of it, &quot;I don&#39;t think a hundred bottles 
would take long for her.&quot;  Ayeka&#39;s jaw dropped in absolute shock, but 
she regained her royal composure after a second or so.  She turned to 
Ryoko.

&quot;How long will it take for us to get to Gasmen?&quot; she questioned.

&quot;About five minutes if Washu lets us use one of her pockets.&quot;

&quot;How would her pockets help?&quot; Ayeka was genuinely confused, &quot;Does she 
have a miniature warp engine, or something like that?&quot;

&quot;No, no, silly princess!&quot; Ryoko felt her sides start to ache from all 
her laughing, &quot;No, Washu has hyper-dimensional pockets.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s how Bakari kidnapped your sister.&quot; Washu explained, &quot;I invented a 
bag some time ago that leads into a dimensional pocket.  There&#39;s a 
nano-computer in the bag, and you use it to program where the other side 
of the pocket will be.  Bakari&#39;s programmed it so the pocket leads to her 
ship.&quot;

&quot;She stuffed my sister into a BAG?!&quot; Ayeka howled angrily, &quot;I&#39;ll never 
forgive that witch!  Please, miss Washu, I beg of you, let us use this 
pocket of yours!  We must get to Gasmen!&quot;

&quot;All right, all right.&quot; Washu sweatdropped, &quot;Don&#39;t fret.  We can do that.  
Can you just...let me go?&quot;  Ayeka suddenly realized that she had grabbed 
Washu by the collar and lifted her just off of her cushion.  She blushed 
madly and dropped the scientist.

&quot;Shall we get going?&quot; the princess giggled sheepishly.

----------

&quot;What&#39;s this place?&quot; Sasami looked out the window of her personal room, 
Bakari standing behind her.

&quot;It&#39;s the planet Gasmen.&quot; the pirate explained, &quot;I&#39;m stopping here for 
news.&quot;

&quot;What kind of news?&quot; Sasami asked, &quot;Can I come with you?&quot;

&quot;I want to know how many of the bounty hunters there are going to try and 
catch me.  I&#39;ve got a few bounties on my head already, but not one this 
high.  No one&#39;s ever tried to come after me before, but money makes people 
do stupid things.  And it might be a bad thing if you come with me.&quot;

&quot;How much is the bounty?  And why would it be a bad thing?&quot;

&quot;I have a fifty billion credit bounty on my head.&quot;  Sasami&#39;s eyes grew 
wide in shock.  Even she, a still young princess, knew how much influence 
a fifty billion credit bounty had.  She didn&#39;t need the second answer 
anymore.  If anyone recognized her, they would know that she was with 
Bakari.  It could result in Bakari&#39;s capture.

&quot;I&#39;ll stay.&quot; Sasami murmured, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to get caught.&quot;

&quot;You might as well.&quot; Bakari gave a smile to the princess, &quot;You&#39;d be safer 
with me than in here.  Someone could try to haul the ship to a port and 
break in.  The bounty won&#39;t be lifted until I&#39;ve been caught, so it really 
doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Sasami closed her hands to fists and almost shouted, &quot;No!  I&#39;ll call 
the bounty off!  I&#39;ll make my family understand!&quot;

&quot;Why would you do that?&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re my friend.&quot; Sasami replied, her pink eyes soft, &quot;You treat 
me like a normal person, not like a princess.&quot;

&quot;Well, if you don&#39;t want to be treated like a princess, then I won&#39;t.&quot; 
Bakari patted the girl on the head, &quot;But if you want to be a pirate, then 
you need to learn the basics.  There&#39;s more to being a pirate than just 
rum and treasure.  There&#39;s also women.&quot;  Sasami jerked and blushed a deep 
crimson.

&quot;Um, don&#39;t you mean boys?&quot; she asked.

&quot;No.&quot; Bakari looked out the window at the smoky gray planet, &quot;There are 
only three real space pirates in the universe: Ryoko, Minagi, and me.  Me, 
I&#39;m too busy to have a relationship, but those two like women.  Besides, 
there seem to be a lot more women in the universe than men.  Women with 
women is a very common thing.&quot;

&quot;Are you really serious?&quot; Sasami didn&#39;t oppose such a thing, but was 
embarrassed to speak of it.  Her face burned.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Bakari chuckled at the expression on Sasami&#39;s face, &quot;Why do you 
think your mothers get along so well?  Women don&#39;t share men well, but 
they&#39;ve gotten around that in a nice way.&quot;  Sasami turned as red as her 
eyes, a spot of blood falling from her nose.  Bakari laughed heartily, 
patting Sasami on the head.

&quot;Moving on.&quot; she snickered, &quot;You should get used to how some of the worse 
scoundrels behave, so you can come with me.  And I&#39;ll teach you how to 
pick a pocket.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; the blush faded instantly, &quot;I&#39;ve always wondered how you pick a 
pocket!&quot;  Bakari stared for a moment, and began to laugh again.

&quot;You are the strangest princess I&#39;ve ever met.&quot; she teased with a wink.

----------

&quot;I can&#39;t believe Washu made me take you down here.&quot; Ryoko sighed slightly, 
&quot;Now we&#39;re just a prime target for an idiot who thinks he&#39;ll get three 
girls at once.&quot;

&quot;But men have cooties.&quot; Minagi winked at her sister.  Ryoko realized 
Minagi&#39;s teasing game, and decided to play along.  &quot;You know, I wouldn&#39;t 
mind sharing miss Ayeka with you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to share.&quot; Ryoko teased, wrapping her arms around Ayeka.  A 
blush consumed Ayeka&#39;s face from neck to hairline, including her ears.  
Ryoko pouted playfully at her sister.  &quot;I want the pretty princess all to 
myself.  Please?  You can have the other princess when we find her.&quot;

&quot;Ah, miss Ryoko, can you, ah, please let me go?&quot; Ayeka sputtered out.

&quot;Oh, but you&#39;re so pretty.&quot; Ryoko suddenly realized she wasn&#39;t teasing the 
princess anymore, but was certainly riding on the idea as not to drive her 
away, &quot;Can&#39;t we please have fun together?  Please, please, please?&quot;  
Ayeka&#39;s nose twitched, and a steady stream of blood slid down her face.  
Ryoko laughed again, but softly, slowly letting Ayeka go.

&quot;Th-thank you.&quot; the violet-haired woman let her breath out, a hand at her 
chest.

&quot;Hey, just so you know.&quot; Ryoko drew closer to whisper in Ayeka&#39;s ear, &quot;I 
wasn&#39;t really playing all that much, pretty girl.&quot;  She lay a soft kiss on 
Ayeka&#39;s ear and skipped away quickly to join her sister.  Ryoko gestured 
for Ayeka to hurry and catch up, smiling broadly as she did.  Ayeka 
blushed, only a pink tinge on her cheeks, and hurried after, drawing the 
hood of the borrowed brown cloak over her head.

----------

&quot;There&#39;s only one person stupid enough to actually try and come after you.  
And it ain&#39;t for the bounty.  And trust me, it ain&#39;t Ryoko or Minagi 
neither.&quot;

&quot;Please, tell me you&#39;re joking.  The GP is actually getting involved?&quot;

&quot;Yep.  Rumor has it that they&#39;ve got Mihoshi and her partner after you.  
They&#39;ve actually been pulled off of hunting down Kagato.&quot;

&quot;They should stay on the bastard.  He gives a bad name to criminals.  He 
kidnaps women and uses them as shields.  Flaming bastard.&quot;

&quot;Should you talk?&quot;

&quot;Hey, she came with me.  But I&#39;m repaying a favor, and that means she 
stays.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, now you&#39;ve got your competition after you.  And their mother.  
But I thought Kagato had already kidnapped her.&quot;

&quot;No.  He kidnapped Washu&#39;s rival, Yume.  I heard that Washu&#39;s pretty 
pissed about that.&quot;

&quot;Still got a grudge against you though, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and now that I&#39;m sober and I know she&#39;s chasing me, I&#39;m a bit 
worried about what she&#39;ll do when she catches up.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you mean if?&quot;

&quot;No, when.  Listen, Jace, thanks for the information, but I had better get 
the hell out of here.  Sorry I didn&#39;t buy a drink, but I&#39;m staying sober 
for a while.  Catch you later.&quot;  Bakari&#39;s hand shot off the counter to 
grab a small hand heading for her pocket.

&quot;Very good, little goddess.&quot; she turned to look at Sasami, &quot;You almost got 
past my cloak.  What&#39;ve you gotten so far?&quot;  Sasami smiled from her own 
gray cloak, one of Bakari&#39;s that they had altered, and held up an armful 
of wallets, money bags, and credit chips.  The bartender&#39;s face fell at 
the massive amount, while Bakari just smiled.

&quot;Very, very good, little goddess.&quot; she let Sasami empty her spoils into 
the pocket-bag, &quot;Now let&#39;s get moving.  I have a feeling that hell&#39;s going 
to break loose soon.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me, may I have your attention?&quot;  All of the bar&#39;s attendees looked 
up to see two women standing in the doorway.  Both women wore plain brown 
clothing, standard laser pistols strapped to their belts.  One of the 
women was dark-skinned with blond hair, and the other was fair-skinned 
with aquamarine hair.  The one with aquamarine hair looked very angry with 
her companion.

&quot;We&#39;re looking for the space pirate Bakari.  Is she here?&quot; the blond woman 
said with a smile, her baby blue eyes cheerful.  Everyone in the bar 
decided to clear out, even the bartender.  Eventually, the two women, 
Bakari, and Sasami were the only left.

&quot;Well, what do you know?&quot; Bakari chuckled, standing from the bar and 
turning to face the two women, &quot;The GP&#39;s first class detectives Kiyone and 
Mihoshi.  How are you?&quot;

&quot;Space pirate Bakari, you are charged with the kidnapping of Jurai royal 
family member, princess Sasami!&quot; the fair-skinned Kiyone called across the 
room, drawing her gun, &quot;You also have many outstanding warrants for other 
crimes, mostly involving theft, breaking and entering, and multiple counts 
of murder!  You have the right to remain silent, and anything--&quot;

&quot;If you hadn&#39;t noticed, detective,&quot; Bakari smirked, &quot;I&#39;ve been read my 
rights about five hundred times, and many of those murders I have warrants 
for are from killing those GP officers.  What makes you think I&#39;ll be any 
different with you two morons?&quot;

&quot;Because this time,&quot; Kiyone&#39;s face tightened in a sneer, &quot;you&#39;re going to 
be captured.&quot;

&quot;No, I won&#39;t.&quot; Bakari snickered, &quot;I&#39;ve been told that exactly four hundred 
and ninety-nine times before, and yours makes five hundred.  The GP can&#39;t 
catch me, and you two won&#39;t make any difference.  What makes you two so 
special?&quot;

&quot;Because I&#39;m asking that you please come with us quietly!&quot; Mihoshi, the 
blond, said with another cheerful smile.  Everyone save the woman who said 
it, sweatdropped at the statement.

&quot;Look, the little goddess has asked me nicely not to kill anyone while 
she&#39;s with me.&quot; Bakari shook her head and shrugged, &quot;So, don&#39;t make me 
kill you.&quot;

&quot;Where is princess Sasami?&quot; Kiyone demanded.

&quot;My ship.&quot; Bakari pointed up, &quot;Where else?  Did you really think I&#39;d be 
stupid enough to bring her with me wherever I go?&quot;

&quot;Then who&#39;s that?&quot; Mihoshi asked about the cloaked figure crouching 
nervously behind Bakari.

&quot;My cousin&#39;s sister&#39;s mother.&quot;

&quot;Your aunt?&quot; Kiyone surmised.

&quot;Whatever.  We&#39;ll be off now.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t going anywhere, missy.&quot;

Bakari&#39;s eyes widened in shock.  She stared at the doorway, where Kiyone 
and Mihoshi had been pushed aside to reveal three more women, two 
identical and one wearing a brown cloak.

&quot;Sister Ayeka!&quot; Sasami whispered so only Bakari could hear.

&quot;Ryoko, Minagi, I see you&#39;re doing well.&quot; Bakari raised a hand and 
summoned her dark blue sword, &quot;Glad to see you aren&#39;t dead, Minagi.  Nice 
scars.&quot;  Minagi&#39;s teeth were bared, her hands white-knuckle tight, and her 
hair bristling.  Ryoko threw out a hand to stop her sister.

&quot;Weird to see you sober.&quot; Ryoko gave a smirk, summoning her own sword, 
&quot;Well, Washu says that you&#39;re lying about the princess being in your ship.  
There&#39;s no life on your ship at the moment.&quot;

&quot;What makes you think she&#39;s not dead?  Or that I didn&#39;t already throw her 
out on my way here?&quot;

&quot;If she was dead, you wouldn&#39;t have to be sober.&quot; Ryoko smiled, taking a 
step forwards, &quot;She&#39;s alive, I&#39;m sure.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Bakari chuckled, &quot;I couldn&#39;t remember why she was on my ship, so 
I threw her out the first hour of my trip here.  You might find her 
decompressed corpse somewhere a million miles back.&quot;

&quot;Bakari, I wouldn&#39;t say all that.&quot; Sasami tugged on the pirate&#39;s cloak and 
whispered.

&quot;Why?&quot; Bakari whispered back.

&quot;AYEKA, DON&#39;T!&quot;

The pirate barely had enough time to lift her arm to strike the angry 
crown princess before she smashed her skull.  She stopped the exceptional 
force of Ayeka&#39;s flight and force field with a hard right, catching Ayeka 
on the cheek and flinging her backwards through the air.  Ryoko caught the 
enraged princess, Minagi rushing forwards to restart the battle.

&quot;Sister Ayeka!&quot; concern laced Sasami&#39;s cry.  She ran forwards slightly, 
only to have Bakari stop her quickly.  Her hood fell back, her teary pink 
eyes and blue-green hair appearing to the light.  Minagi took in the 
sudden appearance with a stare.  The young princess was cute beyond 
reason, and developing into a beauty.  The good pirate remembered why she 
was fighting, and swung down hard with her sword.  Bakari lifted her sword 
and again blocked the double-handed swing with a single hand.  The 
black-haired pirate bent her arm and quickly threw Minagi away.

&quot;Come on!&quot; Bakari gathered Sasami into her arms and suddenly vanished, 
teleporting away and out of the bar.

&quot;I know where she went!&quot; Ryoko snarled.  She grabbed Ayeka around the 
waist and Minagi by the wrist.  The cyan-haired pirate teleported away as 
well.

&quot;They forgot about us, didn&#39;t they?&quot; Mihoshi asked sadly after a moment.

&quot;Yes, Mihoshi, they did.&quot; Kiyone replied.

----------

&quot;Goddess, let&#39;s get the hell out of here.&quot; Bakari let Sasami stand, &quot;God&#39;s 
Arm!  Full power immediately, and put up an anti-teleport shield!  Get us 
the hell away from here!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let you do that.&quot;  Bakari grew pale, her eyes wide.  
She turned from Sasami to see a pink-haired girl-sized woman sitting in 
her hovering chair.

&quot;Hello, Washu.&quot; the greeting came out weak, a bit nervous.

&quot;Hello yourself, Bakari.&quot; Washu replied, &quot;It&#39;s been three hundred years.&quot;

&quot;I knew you would catch up with me.&quot; Bakari frowned, &quot;I can&#39;t outrun you.  
Ryoko and Minagi, maybe, but not you.  You made this ship, you know how to 
stop it.&quot;  Washu hopped off the chair and walked to stand before Bakari 
with a smile, her eyes closed.  In an instant, Washu turned from a girl to 
a well-endowed (and I also mean her muscles) woman and punched Bakari 
smack in the left eye.

The pirate fell to the floor, Washu leaping after her.  The adult Washu 
began to pummel Bakari for all she was worth, Bakari just blocking her 
face from the vicious strong blows.

&quot;No, please, don&#39;t!&quot; Sasami rushed to grab Washu&#39;s arm before she could 
land another punch on Bakari&#39;s throat, &quot;Please, don&#39;t hurt her!&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t hurt her.&quot; Washu said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m going to kill her!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t do that either!&quot; Sasami cried, &quot;Please, Bakari&#39;s my friend!&quot;  At 
that moment, Ryoko, Minagi, and Ayeka appeared just a few feet from where 
the scene took place.  Ayeka ran to pull her sister away, and Minagi 
grabbed her mother.  Ryoko grabbed Bakari by the neck and lifted her from 
the ground, squeezing slightly.

&quot;You know what?&quot; Bakari laughed, blood trailing from her mouth and head, 
her eye already bruised, &quot;Go ahead and kill me, Ryoko.  The bounty&#39;s for 
dead or alive, and you&#39;ve got Sasami back.  I&#39;ve lived for too long, and 
I&#39;m personally tired of it.&quot;

&quot;With pleasure, you bitch.&quot; Ryoko summoned her sword and pulled it back to 
stab Bakari in the head, &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting to do this for what you did to 
my sister.&quot;

&quot;Go ahead.&quot; Bakari smirked, &quot;But you should know one thing.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Ryoko snarled, winding up for the blow.

&quot;If you kill me, you kill Tsunami&#39;s protector.&quot;
