Quick Note

Regarding Mizuki who will be in this part (together with Hitomi). I&#39;m 
pretty sure I mentioned where she comes from already in one of the 
main arcs notes of Dusk but for those new to the Continuum, I&#39;ll say 
it again here.
I realize that everyone bare of the most addicted hardcore otakus of 
the Tenchi Muyo universe would probably be able to recognize the name 
or the person behind it. To make it short. Mizuki is a character from 
the Tenchi Muyo RPG for the Super Famicon. It&#39;s not incredible good 
but anyway... that is not the point here. The game introduces to new 
characters mainly Mizuki and Kusumi, her mother/creator, (another) 
rival of Washu from her academy days (geez, she got a lot, huh?)....

SPOILER WARNING

The plot is rather simple. Mizuki gets sent to Earth to draw out 
Tenchi and the others by first capturing Sasami. The latter is rescued 
during the game and Mizuki failing to defeat Ryoko is shunned by her 
mother. Now Ryoko is captured (and later temporally controlled) by 
Kusumi. Mizuki decides to join Tenchi-tachi to get some revenge on 
being treated like a failure. After Kusumi&#39;s eventual defeat, Mizuki 
goes and beats some sense into her and the &quot;family dispute&quot; seems more 
or less resolved.

END SPOILER WARNING

&lt;Hikawa Jinja ()&gt;
Grandfather Hino stood in the yard of the Jinja, the place he had 
tended to for many years, decades actually. When he had taken over the 
duty, he had soon found out it would be a life of solitude. No one of 
their family cared anymore about the family tradition. And he should 
be proven right. His son turned out to be a disgrace. Not so much in 
his decision to choose another path in life but more so in his 
foolishness to pull others along, whether they wanted to or not. His 
daughter-in-law had been promising. She had often come to visit but 
loyalty to her husband kept her from deepening her interest. With some 
training, she could have been an excellent miko, maybe even 
priestess...
	The old man sighed, the memories weighing heavy on his old 
heart. He cursed himself for not intervening more strongly. He had 
still been head of the family, it would have been in his right... But 
he trusted that his children would find their own way and that it was 
not his place to tell them what to do with their life. It had been 
foolish of him not to see the destruction this wrought on everyone 
involved, and the one suffering the most under it had been little Rei, 
even now the effects were still visible.
	At least until recently. She was being so much happier these 
days. The place that had long been such a lonely sanctuary was now 
filled with virtue, joy spreading from one end to the other. Ever 
since the four girls had banded together in an unlikely yet strangely 
harmonious group over the last couple of months, Hikawa Jinja was not 
the same anymore. And his heart felt enormously lighter knowing that.
	It was almost odd, downright eerie, to have the place as 
deserted as it was now. At least he could once more fulfill his duties 
since his physical health had recovered greatly. Not that the girls 
had done a bad job. Not at all. In fact he felt quite pleased knowing 
the Jinja in such capable hands. But for now, he could be priest 
again. He was getting old and might enjoy this for a bit, especially 
after being in bed mostly for over two months!
	It was still lonely though. Not the gentle voice of Kagome or 
the bickering between his granddaughter and the sturdy Sango - they 
tended to get into arguments a lot and he had a good idea of the 
cause. And there was not the happy laughter of the young, carefree 
spirit that had caught them all under her spell. Young Sasami who was 
a delight to be around and who his granddaughter had obviously taken a 
great liking towards. If he interpreted things right, the feeling was 
mutual. Now if Rei would just get over her innate fear...
	The old man sighed once more. His granddaughter was making 
progress, a great deal thanks to the blue-haired girl for which he 
would be more than happy to forgo close-minded traditions - or rather 
prejudices. All he wanted was for his Rei to be happy, not to be 
caught up in the same tragedy that was her father and mother. 
Unfortunately that was the problem and he thought bitterly that a 
miracle would be necessary to lose her reservations about this kind of 
love.
	Then again, if anyone could pull off that miracle, it might as 
well be Sasami. Maybe they&#39;d be getting closer on the trip the four 
girls - young woman - had taken. With that in mind the old priest 
turned to go and speak a prayer for his granddaughter and her new 
friends.

(Sasami)
I had to admit that I missed this. When I was staying with my sister 
at Tenchi&#39;s place, it had been rather remote and the fresh air there 
was positively invigorating. As time grew by I had actually delighted 
in making longer walks through the mostly untouched nature, basking in 
its beauty. I suppose that was partly a natural attraction, being 
bonded to a Life Tree and all that. City life was exciting sure, 
especially seeing that on Jurai I never had the chance to walk the 
common streets freely and unbothered. However, there was something 
about fresh mountain air and the impressions of untouched nature that 
was calming. Actually the effect was widely known throughout the 
Empire which is why many Tree Ships liked to generate a forest-like 
subspace setting to make their human partners more comfortable.
	&quot;I have to say. That was a great idea,&quot; Sango commented from her 
place where she was sitting submerged in the water next to Kagome, 
with one arm around the raven-haired girl&#39;s shoulders. She looked 
quite content, although it was debatable whether that was from the 
closeness to her girlfriend or the relaxing hot liquid.
	We were currently all lounging in one of the many hot springs 
located here in this particular area. Since Rei&#39;s grandfather had 
gotten better to the point where he could take care of his priest&#39;s 
duties once again, Rei had made the offer to take us all along to one 
of her favorite spots for spiritual purification. Or that was the 
official cause. I knew her well enough by now that I suspected she 
wanted to give us all some private bonding time outside of the shrine 
duties. The incident with the spirit a little more than a month ago 
now had served to coalesce us into a stronger unit and served to make 
clear even more than before that our meeting was not just pure 
coincidence.
	&quot;Yes, this was a fantastic idea, Rei-dono. We&#39;ve all been 
working so hard, it is nice to relax like that. And there are enough 
springs so that we can be on our own,&quot; Kagome added. The reservoir was 
actually well-visited from Jinja all throughout Tokyo and even other 
parts of Japan but the quantity of springs guaranteed a certain 
privacy to the various groups that came here.
	&quot;Would you stop calling me that?&quot; Rei asked mildly irritated, 
getting a round of giggles in reply. It had become a common theme. At 
some point after the incident with the spirit, Kagome had pointed out 
that our little group needed some kind of leader and so my little joke 
from the day of the pair&#39;s arrival at the Jinja had been taken up 
again and we started to address Rei as &quot;Head Miko&quot; or simply with the 
more respective &quot;-dono&quot; suffix. Rei always seemed torn between pleased 
and embarrassed when we did. I believed that she secretly liked it.
	&quot;Besides,&quot; Rei continued. &quot;We are not supposed to be relaxing. 
We are only here to cleanse our minds and hearts.&quot;
	I giggled again at that, earning a cross look from the oldest 
among us. &quot;You sound like an old monk who has spent decades in 
solitude.&quot;
	Sango laughed at that. &quot;She&#39;s right, you know. You can&#39;t just 
always concentrate on duties and responsibilities. You have to take 
time to relax once in awhile or life will pass you by before you know 
it.&quot; Something in her tone made me assume that the other girl was 
speaking from experience.
	Rei glowered for a moment at Sango. Those two tended to be off 
different minds once in awhile. It wasn&#39;t nearly as dramatic as say, 
my sister and Ryoko - then again, barely anyone could match them - but 
where Rei was often arguing more on the spiritual side of things, 
Sango turned out to be more a practical, forward person who would 
rather take the more simple approach compared to thinking about it too 
long. She was a trained fighter - in what I wasn&#39;t too sure - that 
much I could tell.
	Eventually our nominal leader sighed in defeat. &quot;Oh, fine. Have 
it your way. I feel much too good right now to argue.&quot; And with that 
she leaned her head against the edge of the pool and closed her eyes. 
I had to smile fondly, catching myself for not the first time admiring 
her physical form in her semi-naked state with just a towel wrapped 
around herself. It was an opportunity I was thoroughly delighting in. 
Others might be scandalized that a girl of barely fourteen years - 
physical - age was entertaining such improper thoughts but I wasn&#39;t 
your ordinary fourteen year old, and back on Jurai many children, 
especially the royal ones were trained much earlier in the &quot;bedroom 
arts&quot; when the majority here. We were expected to marry early after 
all and produce heirs. Another thing that had played a role in my 
leaving - although that was more a pleasant accessory circumstance.
	Besides, Rei and I WERE getting closer. Not so much on the 
emotional plane than on the physical one. That expressed itself by a 
heightened degree of unconscious actions, mostly on Rei&#39;s part, like 
holding hands, the occasional touch here and there to signal the other 
of your presence and silent support. We hadn&#39;t talked about what 
happened in the eve of the battle with the spirit but it was apparent 
that it was not just on my mind and that the older girl was getting 
more and more comfortable with our growing closeness.
	The progress was a silent, not openly acknowledged one. But it 
was there and that alone gave me hope and the patience I needed to see 
this through. With every passing day I was falling more and more in 
love with the older miko and honestly could not even bring myself to 
entertain the thought of not living my life by her side. This feeling 
was much stronger, much more intense than anything I had ever felt for 
Tenchi before and had to admit to myself eventually that I had deluded 
myself into thinking a simple crush could be about actual love.
	Feeling a bit bolder by now, encouraged by Rei&#39;s own growing 
signs of affection, I moved so that my hand was touching her shoulder 
underneath the surface. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t stress yourself too much, 
Rei-chan. It only makes you more irritable and grumpy. I should know, 
Oneechan often is like that.&quot;
	Rei shivered slightly at the contact but didn&#39;t pull away or 
showed in any other way that she was uncomfortable. In fact, a 
humorous smile played around her face, making her look even more 
radiant in my eyes. The body was one thing, but I often felt myself 
drawn back to her face, the smiles coming more freely and openly now. 
For me. That made me feel very special indeed. &quot;So speaks my private 
consciousness,&quot; Rei teased and I blushed lightly but inwardly glowed 
at the comment.
	Kagome and Sango shared a knowing look. &quot;Do you miss your sister 
and family?&quot; Kagome asked. One would be surprised to find that none of 
the others would make any inquiries about my past. I had been 
comfortable enough around the three older girls to talk more openly 
about personal things, like the occasional comment about my family, 
one of my friends... None of them had ever pressed the matter. I 
suppose that was a part of our common bond. All four of us shared some 
past experiences that we would rather not talk about and so the 
respect for that privacy was rather instinctual, and also the 
understanding and compassion should one of us let something slip.
	&quot;Hai, I do,&quot; I replied wistfully. In fact I had often thought 
back on my family back on Jurai and how they would be coping. Actually 
I knew some of the things through Tsunami and her connection to her 
children. Just because I left didn&#39;t mean that I stopped to care after 
all. I was pleased to see that things had started to quiet down but 
was a little saddened at the apparent concern I had caused. That 
couldn&#39;t be helped though.
	I was startled feeling Rei&#39;s hand touch mine under the water, 
squeezing gently. Her violet eyes were resting on me with mild 
sympathy. I didn&#39;t really think about it when I leaned my head against 
the older girl&#39;s shoulder. Rei made no move to object though. &quot;But I 
have you all, minna-san. And that is good enough for me at the 
moment.&quot;
	Sango smirked but didn&#39;t comment.

******************************

(Kagome)
It was a little later, the sun had already vanished behind the 
mountain tops, when I found myself walking outside, relishing the 
clear air. I had to admit I had missed this. City air and nature air 
were two entirely different things. Before my first trip to the 
Sengoku Jidai I had never really noticed it. It was like realizing 
that there was a whole world outside your own house or something like 
that. The change had been gradual but I started to notice the 
difference... and I started to notice that I would prefer the clearer 
air of the past over the often smog-filled streets of modern Tokyo. Oh 
sure, I would complain about stuff like the lack of a proper bed or 
other such day-to-day comforts. Secretly though, I didn&#39;t really care 
all that much anymore. Despite trying to pretend otherwise, my bed had 
never felt the same again after my first trip through the well.
	Then again, I suppose a lot of that was also because of Him. I 
could honestly say that meeting Inuyasha had changed my life. If 
positive or negative that was for others to judge and for me not to 
care about. Not anymore. It was done and I felt comfortable with who I 
was today. A little stronger and wiser. Not just your ordinary 
schoolgirl who had had no clear idea what to do with her life past 
school. My life had gotten a purpose back then and it had affected 
everything up until that moment.
	And now I had knowledge, too. Knowledge no normal girl my age 
should possess without the proper training. Rei had asked me earlier 
how long I had been training to be a miko. Not really thinking about 
it I had answered as truthfully as technically possible, that I never 
had much interest in my grandfather&#39;s attempts of teaching until my 
fifteen birthday, which was now about two years ago. Not to 
surprising, Rei had been rather dubious.
	I sighed. Sometimes it made me uncomfortable, that parting gift 
from Kikyou. We were so different. Reincarnation or not. Our very 
outlook on life was different. And I wanted to be angry at her for 
playing her part in the tragedy revolving around the 
now-thankfully-dead Naraku. But I couldn&#39;t really. Not after I had 
received all those memories and understood intimately what kind of 
life she had lived, what kind of sacrifices she had made, just for the 
very thing now hanging securely around my neck wherever I went. And 
thinking about that, I just couldn&#39;t really be angry anymore.
	&#39;Still,&#39; I thought, &#39;sometimes I could do without all the extra 
knowledge. There are things you should rather stay oblivious to, for 
your own sanity&#39;s sake. Like Sasami for example.&#39; After the battle 
with the Youkai spirit who turned out to be an old adversary of ours - 
who had once impersonated a Water God and given us quite a bit of 
trouble in the process -, I had taken aside the youngest member of our 
group and carefully commented on what I&#39;ve seen. She hadn&#39;t been 
terribly surprised at my discovery and asked me to keep quiet about 
it. She wanted to reveal things on her own time. To Rei mainly - it 
didn&#39;t take much to figure that out. I agreed but...
	It&#39;s not all that easy to know you share a home with a walking 
embodiment of life. Kikyou had heard about the Life Tree, of course, 
and as much as I tried to deny it, there was simply no normal tree to 
match the power level of the dryad I had seen. And Sasami&#39;s harmonic 
aura that staid that way EVERYWHERE she went made much more sense this 
way.
	I would respect her wishes though. What else could I do? I owed 
her already for how she had - unconsciously or not - helped Sango and 
I to finally begin loosening all that excess baggage from our 
experiences with Naraku. And Sasami was such a nice person. I didn&#39;t 
know any more details about her connection with that powerful 
elemental being but from what I could speculate, it was mind-boggling 
enough.
	I had become rather sensitive though to how people felt and when 
they were uncomfortable. Sasami wasn&#39;t someone who threw her secret 
around with the intent on impressing people. I could say that with 
almost absolute certainty. In fact from what I had gauged from our 
short talk it made her somewhat uncomfortable. She wanted to be 
treated as normal and not as some supernatural being too far out of 
synch with &#39;normal&#39; life to be considered one of us. It made me sad, 
reminding me too much of Inuyasha. That was another cause why I staid 
silent.
	She and Rei made such a sweet couple... potential couple. I 
wouldn&#39;t ruin that. There was no danger posed by Sasami, that was 
enough for me. Although I could not deny a certain curiosity. The 
blue-haired girl was a mystery. Her aura was so colorful and manifold 
it became confusing to figure it out. I had a feeling there was much 
more to her when just that one secret. It was not my place though. Not 
really. It was Rei who had to deal with it, who was supposed not to 
freak when it came to the revelation part. I was fairly certain she 
wouldn&#39;t.
	I knew how common people reacted to what they did not 
understand. Even the gifted were prone to error or misjudgment as I 
had found out on the one or other occasion myself. Rei didn&#39;t strike 
me as the type of person to easily pass judgment. Once you got to know 
her, you found a compassionate, young woman who cared a lot for the 
ones she loved - especially a certain blue-haired girl lately. Quick 
to anger but also quick to forgive and forget.
	Between Sango and I it wasn&#39;t so much a question whether or not 
they would get together anymore. Just a question of the When.
	I was jolted out of my thoughts when I suddenly found my path 
blocked. Looking up surprised, I found a young-looking man - barely 
past his early twenties if I was to hazard a guess - standing there, 
clad in the traditional garb of a monk from some monastery. He was 
bald and shaven to the point of blinding, wearing a grin that might be 
impressively flattering to some girl but much too smug and false for 
my liking.
	&quot;My, what is such a delicious young flower doing out here all 
alone. Surely the gods must jest having such a rare gem without 
suitable companionship,&quot; the monk said with mock-outrage.
	I could not help the blush. Even though I was already a little 
disgusted, I could not suppress the old urges. Until after I visited 
the Sengoku Jidai I had never had much experience with boys or love in 
general. But then men seemed to fall over me all of a sudden. Kouga, 
Houjou, and, of course, Inuyasha. It was a little flattering. And I 
might have even acknowledge that the fellow now was certainly handsome 
if not for the dramatic sweet talk.
	I was ready to do something quite nasty - and you really don&#39;t 
want to know what - when he made to touch me, but I was saved from 
that particular course when the monk suddenly cried out in apparent 
discomfort. His arm had been grabbed and twisted slightly in a strong 
grip - and I could attest to the strength from firsthand experience - 
by Sango who seemed to have come out of nowhere.
	&quot;You must be mistaken, mister. My friend here,&quot; she emphasized 
by stepping around the taller man, still holding him immobile in a 
rather easy-seeming manner, and pulling me against her with her other 
arm quite possessively, &quot;is taken already. So, go harass some other 
girl. Preferably where I can&#39;t see you.&quot;
	The man put up a brave and defiant front for a moment but Sango 
obviously wanted to make a point and the angry hiss, punctuating her 
claim, made the monk avert his gaze sharply, stumbling back when the 
Taijiya let go of his arm. With that Sango turned us around and 
started to walk away. I had not much choice but to follow along. A 
glance over my shoulder revealed that the fellow stood there quite 
stunned, looking after us with the appearance like a fish on dry land.
	I chuckled, despite feeling more like shivering in positive 
delight at the possessive way Sango kept holding me. &quot;You are pretty 
jealous,&quot; I commented teasingly.
	Sango remained serious though. &quot;I have every cause to be. After 
all I have the prettiest girl around here as my girlfriend.&quot;
	I blushed again, this time genuine. Tilting my head, I put a 
fluttering kiss on the other girl&#39;s cheek. &quot;I don&#39;t mind that you are 
possessive. It feels nice,&quot; I replied softly and with an affectionate 
grin added, &quot;my protector.&quot;

******************************

(Rei)
I had come up here often, both before and after I became a Senshi. 
This place was a perfect place for meditation and - even if I was 
damned to admit that in front of Sango - relaxing. The air was clean 
and perfect and the hot springs definitely refreshing for body and 
mind. And it also was a place away from the general hubbub of the 
city. A place of solitude. Perfectly suited for me... Or that&#39;s what 
it had been like before and shortly after I met my comrades. The last 
years, I had felt more and more lonely here. To a point where I had 
invited Usagi and the others to come with me last year. I think it was 
probably the first time I did something like that. A testament to the 
sisterhood existing between us. I had wanted to do the same this year 
but not all of them had found the time. Technically, I didn&#39;t have the 
time either. I still had studies to catch up with. However, visiting 
here had been kind of a ritual in itself for years.
	And so I had taken Sasami and the other two along. It made sense 
after all. We were all working at the same Jinja now. We needed to get 
along better and this was a perfect opportunity... Of course, I 
already knew that we worked great together. That had been proven not 
only by the brief skirmish with the evil spirit but also in the time 
afterwards. An immediate kinship seemed to have formed between us. 
Unconsciously, without much words or actions. It was just there. Six 
or so years ago, before I met Usagi and the others, I would have been 
wary. But now, things were different. I couldn&#39;t master the motivation 
for skepticism, to always see the negative in closer association 
anymore. What we had was a good thing and I wanted to enjoy it.
	Too long had the Jinja been a lonely place. They had given the 
place a new, brighter light. A light I hope we could preserve. 
Together. &#39;Guess I am getting soft,&#39; I thought and chuckled at the 
observation.
	Kagome had gone out to take a late night stroll some time ago. 
Sango had followed a bit later. Not surprisingly. Those two rarely 
strayed far from each other and even more rarely did they stay apart 
for any greater length of time. I wasn&#39;t sure they even could. As much 
as that sounded like exaggeration, it really wasn&#39;t. There was a kind 
of desperation in their bond, like an invisible chain that tied them 
together and which would snap and couldn&#39;t be repaired if they spent 
too much time without the other. I wasn&#39;t sure I even wanted to know 
the exact cause behind this, that wasn&#39;t my business. But it made me a 
little sad and also angry for whatever wrong had been done to them.
	I acknowledged that aspect though, trying not to have them 
separated too much. When it came to handing out chores, I made sure 
they would be close together most of the time. A little annoying, but 
a minor sacrifice to make them comfortable. And I would be a bad 
hostess - and &#39;Head Miko&#39; as they continued to label me -, if I didn&#39;t 
make sure that those under my care were indeed comfortable. We were 
friends, kindred spirits. Why would I want them unhappy?
	Thinking about the pair brought me involuntarily back to Sasami 
and myself these days and our own... well, let&#39;s call it &quot;hard to 
separate&quot; status. I was aware of the subtle changes in our... 
&#39;relationship&#39;. There hadn&#39;t been any words exchanged regarding the 
younger girl&#39;s more or less revealing actions. I couldn&#39;t bring myself 
to do that and she wasn&#39;t pursuing the issue. Something I was both 
relieved and anxious about. It was obvious that Sasami was giving me 
time but I had no idea how to take that, what to do with it. I was 
torn in two directions and unable to decide. And so covert actions had 
to speak and they did indeed form a message... A message that scared 
me. I was no fool, I knew what it meant. And I would have let my heart 
jump at the opportunity maybe if not for...
	I shook my head. It seemed more and more like I was already 
caught in the spider&#39;s web with no way out and the more I struggled, 
the more entangled I became. And still I couldn&#39;t help it. I was too 
scarred to just plunge forward headfirst. I just couldn&#39;t do it.
	And still I was looking for her again, was I not? Sasami had 
just gone out to get some refreshments but hadn&#39;t been back until now 
which could have numerous reasons. One of them the simple fact that 
the line in front of the caf&eacute; that was up here, serving the 
reservoir&#39;s guests with food and drinks, was quite large. I groaned 
inwardly. Had I become so... dependant on her presence? &#39;You&#39;ve become 
pathetic, Rei,&#39; I chided myself but continued onwards nonetheless.
	Soon the caf&eacute; came into view and it took me only a moment to 
spot my query. After all, I didn&#39;t need to locate her unique aura. 
Hairstyle and color were rather outstanding around here. She wore the 
traditional white and red miko garb and I had to admit it suited her 
just fine. Actually it made her look rather... No, I would not go 
there!
	She hadn&#39;t seen me yet being almost at the front of the line. I 
decided to wait here since she had to come back this way. That was 
when I saw something that made my blood boil. I knew the fellow. He 
had a reputation around here for being a womanizer, came practically 
every year, just like myself, and never failed to attract some 
attention. And he was talking to Sasami. Sweet, innocent Sasami who...
	I pushed through the crowd, ignoring irritated shouts. It was 
one of these instances again where I didn&#39;t really think about what I 
was doing - happened a lot lately when it concerned Sasami. All I 
wanted to do was getting the younger girl away from that lecher. I 
arrived just in time to hear him spout his usual nonsense. I was 
fairly disgusted.
	&quot;How far have you sunken already, Touchimaru. Now you need to 
harass younger girls already. Did no one else want to be rescued by 
you?&quot; I sniped coldly, putting my hands on my hands and sending the 
older monk who had whirled around startled a murderous glare.
	It took him a moment to compose himself but when he did, I 
regretted that I had not taken Sasami and left right away. The stupid 
fool didn&#39;t take refusals well. He tended to develop a sort of 
obsession. &quot;Hino-san! What a delight to see your beautiful face again. 
Alas, I have no time for you right now. I have already promised that 
fair maiden to spent the evening with me. You would have to agree that 
such an exotic flower can hardly be left alone and without...&quot;
	I groaned audibly. I really didn&#39;t want to hear that nonsense 
any longer than I needed and I was seriously considering breaking some 
of our basic rules and transform right here, just so that I could 
roast him well for having the nerve to bother a minor. Not to mention 
Sasami of all people. What I did though, was once again more 
instinctive than rational. Pushing past him I interrupted his speech 
and slipped an around Sasami&#39;s shoulder. Glaring up at the older monk 
I made certain that he understood exactly what I meant with my next 
words, &quot;You are mistaken, Touchimaru-san. The fair maiden is not 
without companionship. In fact she is with me and I would approve of 
it if you leave now and not bother my friend again.&quot;
	For a moment, the monk stood there perplexed, then his 
expression darkened considerably and turning away with a scowl I 
barely caught his mumbled words when he stalked away. &quot;What is it with 
girls these days? Don&#39;t they appreciate a real man anymore? Surely the 
gods must play a dirty joke on me today.&quot;
	I had to smirk at the comment. From his words I had the distant 
idea that he had run into either Kagome or Sango. And that that hadn&#39;t 
gone well for him was not hard to figure out. Served him right in my 
opinion.
	That was when I became aware that I was still holding Sasami 
protectively and that we had attracted quite a bit of attention. 
Sasami hadn&#39;t said anything yet. In fact, she seemed to enjoy the 
contact and while my rational mind was screaming at me to let go, I 
could not deny the sudden rush of warmth I felt right now.
	Unfortunately Sasami had to say the worst possible thing then. 
With a teasing look she finally glanced over her shoulder. &quot;You are 
getting awfully possessive, Rei-chan.&quot;

******************************

(Sasami)
What did I do? What did I do?
	The one thought ran frantically through my mind. I kept thinking 
back on what happened just a few minutes ago. It had started 
innocently enough. I had been thirsty and told Rei that I would get 
something to drink, asked her if she wanted something too, of course. 
Arriving at the caf&eacute;, I had found a rather long line but I wasn&#39;t in 
any particular hurry. Then, almost to the front, some stranger 
addressed me rather untowardly. I have to admit, I was not the type to 
get that much attention, especially from older men. Even possible 
marriage candidates had often treated me more like a child and, 
thinking about my sister, I was always comfortable with that. Even 
Tenchi could often not see past that circumstance...
	But that bitter thought didn&#39;t belong here. I had learned how to 
deal with Touchimaru&#39;s kind though. Ayeka had taken me aside once and 
told me a couple of things. How to treat nobles who got a little bit 
too personal for your liking. And that guy reminded me too much of 
their sort back on Jurai. Thus, I had been prepared to deal with him 
accordingly. I might have been a little flattered since advances like 
that didn&#39;t happen to me often but I had not completely lost my wits. 
Beside, my focus was set in a different direction already.
	Turned out that I didn&#39;t have to do anything in the end. I had 
no idea why Rei showed up - maybe she got lonely without me? - but I 
was definitely glad about it. Really, really flattered actually to 
have her hold me like that. In public. The old clich&eacute; about dying 
right there and being happy had a certain appeal. It might have even 
been preferable to what followed.
	I had just been teasing. She should be used to it by now. And I 
really had not been aware that I was crossing some sort of line. She 
never had reacted like that before. Alright, maybe she tended to get a 
little uncomfortable when I hinted at any kind of closeness displayed. 
But Rei had never...
	I sighed. It had to be what I said, couldn&#39;t quite figure out 
the why, but it had to be. The older miko had looked white like a 
ghost there for a moment and I&#39;ve been really worried then. I had 
reached out for her when she had let go of me to step back. I wanted 
to know what was wrong. She&#39;d looked at me really scared then. For a 
moment I had thought it was me and that had hurt. That was exactly the 
sort of reaction I didn&#39;t want from her. For a fleeting moment I had 
thought that she might have found out my secret, that maybe Kagome had 
told her after all. But that didn&#39;t make much sense. And then I 
realized that it wasn&#39;t me. She seemed more... scared of herself.
	The realization came too late though. Rei had already 
disappeared in the crowd by the time I regained control of myself. And 
now here I was, frantically looking for the older miko all over the 
place. I was frightened that without knowing I might have damaged 
whatever we had beyond repair and that fear made me feel cold and 
helpless. With every moment that passed, every place I didn&#39;t find her 
at, my anxiety grew and I could think less and less straight.
	&#39;Focus, Sasami.&#39; I wasn&#39;t sure if that was my thought or 
Tsunami. Regardless, I knew I had to follow it. Aimlessly running 
around would do me nothing. I could find Rei when I just concentrated. 
Even with as much spiritual-gifted in the area as here, the 
raven-haired girl normally stood out like a vivid flame. And the 
connection we shared should make this even easier. I wondered how much 
time I had wasted walking and running around, simply trying to find my 
quarry by sight alone. Love could really make you crazy, I suppose.
	Forcing myself to stand still, I searched for my inner center 
and then reached out into the surrounding area. I could feel Tsunami&#39;s 
comforting presence in the background, gently surrounding me and 
aiding my focus. There were Kagome and Sango. I smiled at the image I 
got. But where was... Ah! There she was. Not really far from here. 
Surprisingly enough I had unconsciously searched in the right 
direction, as if drawn to my nominal love interest.
	That taken care of, I resumed my accelerated pace, this time 
with more purpose. I had to get to the bottom of this. The thought 
that Rei might want some time alone, didn&#39;t even enter my mind at that 
point. I had to know what was going on and what I had done wrong. How 
else was I supposed to know what to watch out for the next time. 
Besides, she didn&#39;t seem angry at me, more like a personal problem. 
And even if I had no feelings at all for Rei, I did not like seeing a 
friend hurt.
	While I followed the spiritual trail, I went over the scene 
earlier once more and wondered once again what could have upset the 
other girl so much. Situations like this showed that despite being 
physically around fourteen, my experience in the love field were 
barely passable and equaled more my chronological age... if at all. 
All my skills and knowledge didn&#39;t do me much good here. Tsunami never 
really had a love interest herself and couldn&#39;t help. Which left me. 
The young girl forced to grow up too quickly, skipping some 
fundamental lessons in the process.
	This wasn&#39;t the first time that circumstance reared its ugly 
head. I had expected too much of Tenchi when we returned to Jurai, I 
had unconsciously pushed him too far where he was already stressed 
enough by the political chaos at that time. I might be growing up much 
faster, but that didn&#39;t exactly mean that I had fully left behind my 
childhood. Quite on the contrary. Where others went about that change 
gradually - as it should be - I was often torn between the one and the 
other extreme. And that often showed in stupid, childish actions or 
simply the inability to understand things on a more mature plane. In 
short, I was making mistakes without even realizing them and could not 
do a thing about them.
	*I&#39;m sorry,* Tsunami offered sincerely.
	&quot;Not your fault,&quot; I reassured her, finally spotting Rei in the 
distance. She was sitting on a formation of small rocks on the edge of 
the mountain. From here the path winded downwards, back into the 
valley.
	Slowly I approached her position, making no attempt to hide my 
presence. She probably knew that I was there anyway. Keeping a worried 
eye on her averted form, I settled down right next to her, keeping 
just a little bit of respectful distance. Rei made no move to 
acknowledge my presence, neither positive nor negative.
	I followed her gaze for the moment, looking out over the valley. 
Bits of Tokyo could be seen in the distance, the mighty Tokyo Tower 
for example. The view was breathtaking, I had to admit, and had the 
situation been different, I would have been happy enough to just sit 
here and enjoy it. As it was, there was once again a thick silence, 
reminding me of that one evening shortly after my arrival at the 
Hikawa Jinja. The other instant where I had almost lost her 
friendship. In the end, everything had been put right surprisingly 
easy. That was when I had figured out for certain how much I really 
cared for Hino Rei. That I was thoroughly in love with my older host. 
Things had looked up from then on. I wondered if this now was the end 
of my pursuit. The ultimate defeat. It felt like it. Then again, I had 
thought that as well the last time.
	I risked a glance towards Rei again. Shyly, carefully. What I 
found were troubled purple eyes moving to meet my own in utter 
synchrony, lips slightly parted as if to say something. Just like my 
own. A weak smile formed around my lips. A tiny knowing grin on the 
older girl&#39;s face. A secret smile of mutual humor shared by us both.
	No, I reasoned, as I turned look forward again. Not a defeat. 
This storm would be weathered as well. And whatever was troubling Rei, 
I would try and help her as much as possible. I would show her that I 
wasn&#39;t so easily deterred and that I was willing to care for her, for 
all her needs.

******************************

(Rei)
I had gone and done it again. I had acted impulsively instead of 
rational and calm. What good was all my training if I couldn&#39;t control 
my feelings when it mattered? Not that I normally couldn&#39;t. It was 
just her. It was always her. Before I met Sasami I was fairly proud of 
my level of self-control. It was by far not perfect and I knew my 
temper shown through sometimes. But only if I found it really 
necessary. Sasami could throw my entire composure off-balance by just 
merely being in my presence.
	She brought out the best and the worst in me. That was probably 
the easiest way to describe it. Was that love? I guess it was. After 
all I was getting possessive already.
	&#39;Gee, now you are getting sarcastic in your head,&#39; I thought 
bitterly. The problem was that I knew that more than a spark of truth 
lurked behind it all. And yet, I cursed myself for having overreacted 
like this. I should have known better than to take her words this 
seriously. The poor child probably had no idea in what wound she 
accidentally stepped. It was annoying really, that after all these 
years, all my attempts to close that chapter of my life permanently, I 
could not leave it behind. I didn&#39;t like living in the past and 
still...
	I sighed. It seemed like I had no choice but to tell the younger 
girl just what was the matter. Knowing her, she wouldn&#39;t rest 
peacefully before she knew, and I really owed her an explanation. No 
one had ever been so caring towards me before. Not on such a deep, 
personal level. I felt like I could really trust her. She was already 
more than simply a kindred spirit. Much more...
	And I desperately hoped that turned out not to be a bad thing.
	Sasami shifted slightly. &quot;Rei-san, I want to...&quot;
	I held up a hand. &quot;No please, don&#39;t apologize. I was being 
stupid and if anyone should apologize it ought to be me.&quot; Without 
really knowing what I did, I reached out to put one hand on her 
shoulder, forcing myself not to avert my gaze from her pinkish-red 
eyes. &quot;I made you worry.&quot;
	Sasami&#39;s eyes were gentle. &quot;I like to worry about you.&quot; Once 
again I felt my cheeks flush at the affection directed at me. I wasn&#39;t 
used to that, but I did not look away. &quot;I tend to expect too much 
sometimes. You know, I really am not as old as I seem but on the other 
one maybe much too old at times. It is hard to find the balance.&quot; 
Somehow I had the feeling she wasn&#39;t being figurative here. &quot;I am just 
as inexperienced with this as you are. The only other person I thought 
I loved before...&quot; She turned away, a barely audible sigh escaping her 
lips. &quot;I expected too much there. I don&#39;t know very much about love 
other than childish notions like the knight in shining armor that 
comes and sweeps me off my feet at one point.&quot; I had to smile at that 
and Sasami seemed to relax more. Her eyes though, focused again on 
mine, were still serious, solemn even. &quot;I only know that I really like 
you, Rei. And when I said something wrong earlier, please tell me. I 
don&#39;t want to hurt you.&quot;
	It was my turn to avert my gaze, the deep flush thoroughly 
embarrassing. For someone who just claimed she had not much experience 
on the love field either, Sasami sure could create a striking effect 
with most of what she said or did. Then again, I had never really had 
to deal with someone else on this emotional level since Kaidou. Maybe 
that was why I felt so easily flattered.
	&quot;Some time ago, I realized that I didn&#39;t want to fall in love,&quot; 
I began silently. &quot;I thought I would want to make everything mine if I 
did.&quot; This was still a sore issue. I had made that particular 
resolution after the incident with the Rain Trees. The memories 
invoked in that time had been too much to bear and I didn&#39;t have 
someone to really confide in, to trust like... like I trusted Sasami 
now. And that was why I was able to let my shields down around her, 
wasn&#39;t it? The thought was more comfortable when thinking that it was 
her who could tear down my barriers so easily.
	Things had changed since that time, too. I had seen other 
examples. Usagi and Mamoru. But I had often treated them more as the 
exception. Their love was something special. Something seemingly 
untouchable. &quot;I know now, that that&#39;s only part of the truth. Love is 
both selfish and selfless. You decide that for yourself but...&quot; I 
didn&#39;t believe that love like this could ever be for myself. And that 
was why I could not help, could not stop to doubt, could not stop to 
be scared of it - and it was time I admitted that to myself.
	There was a moment of silence in which Sasami obviously mulled 
over my words. Very carefully she asked eventually, &quot;Is this... about 
your father?&quot;
	Was it? That was a fairly good question. It started there, I 
suppose, but I could not blame my attitude solely on him after all. 
Only a fair-sized portion. &quot;He wanted to have everything, too. Family 
and his career.&quot; And that was when it started to go downhill, that was 
where I really started to blame my father. &quot;They were happy when they 
got together - or that is what Okaasan had always told me... He should 
have let her go then. That or give up his career.&quot; I had seen pictures 
of them. When they were younger. At their wedding and before that. 
Grandfather had shown them to me and I had always had trouble 
comparing them to the cold and distant man of the present. &quot;But he 
wanted both and... We ended up suffering under it. I don&#39;t really 
blame him for choosing his career. I blame him for being so selfish.&quot;
	I was startled when short arms wrapped around me and Sasami 
leant forward to rest her head on my shoulder. I shuddered and 
wrestled with the impulse to draw away from the unexpected and quite 
intimate contact. It felt so... safe, so right. The impulse to pull 
away lost and I found myself awkwardly returning the hug. That was 
probably as far as one of us had ever went since that telltale kiss on 
the cheek weeks ago. It felt so natural to hold the younger girl like 
this, and to be held in return.
	Sasami lifted her head to look at me, with quiet compassion but 
also a gentle firmness in her eyes that would allow no argument. &quot;You 
are not like him,&quot; she said softly. And the way she put it coupled 
with her totally convincing expression, I was inclined to believe her.
	And yet I whispered back my own fears, rhe root of the entire 
problem, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that I am.&quot;
	Once again. I could not predict the reaction. Not at all. That 
was part of the mystery that was Sasami. You could never be totally 
sure what to expect. There was happy, carefree Sasami, there was the 
more mature Sasami who often brooded too much for her own good. And so 
many more facets in between.
	Right now she was giggling, pulling away so that she could catch 
her breath. I couldn&#39;t help feeling a little hurt and conveyed that in 
the bewildered look I sent her way. It took a few seconds for the 
younger girl to calm down enough to explain herself and my confusion 
grew with every passing moment.
	Sasami took a deep breath before speaking again. &quot;Gomen. I 
just... From what I&#39;ve seen so far, I can&#39;t believe you think you are 
like your father. Believe me, I know what I&#39;m talking about. You can&#39;t 
be like him, I doubt you could make a decent politician even if you 
tried.&quot;
	The blink was probably heard at the other end of the mountain.
	It took me several moments to figure out just what she meant by 
that statement. And it was only her innocent face that seemed to be on 
the verge of breaking out in one of those playful grins that I 
realized she had just been teasing me again. Not too mention insulting 
me in the process. Not that I minded the observation since I pretty 
much agreed. But insult was insult. &quot;Why, you little...&quot; I lounged for 
the shorter girl but she had already moved. Squealing the blue-haired 
tease had already evacuated the stones and was bounding away giggling 
madly.
	This was outrageous, totally different from how I had always 
thought of myself. But... In the end it didn&#39;t matter. As I was moving 
to follow with the fleeing form of the younger girl I could feel the 
tension draining and for a short while I was able to forget all those 
dark memories.
	She had done it again. But I wasn&#39;t angry. I was actually very 
glad to have Sasami at the moment.
	&quot;Wait until I catch you!&quot; I yelled, not caring about onlookers 
as I chased the squealing girl across the mountain.

******************************

(Sango)
Summer had hit full force on Tokyo this year - not that I had more 
than the past year to compare with in this time - and I was really 
glad to be up here where the air was cooler and more agreeable with 
me. For someone who came from a time period where smog and all the 
other strange, unhealthy smells of a modern city were unknown, it had 
been a bit of an adjustment. Not as big as one would think but still 
an adjustment. In a life as a taijiya, you were just as exposed to 
venomous often enough, some probably more dangerous than the level of 
pollution in this age.
	I still preferred air like this though. Up here it was still 
more or less untouched. Kirara - who was currently back in our room - 
thoroughly delighted in it. Her nose was more sensitive to the change 
and she had had a much harder time getting used to the modern era.
	&quot;Ah yes, right there. Oh, that feels good.&quot;
	I smiled delightful at the drawn-out moan of appreciation that 
came from my friend. After the episode with the obtrusive monk - who 
reminded me a little too much of a certain Buddhist priest... Then 
again, Miroku hardly was THAT bad. Not that the line of separation was 
very thick...
	Well, as I said. After that particular episode, Kagome and I had 
decided to take a late night bath. The temperature was still high 
enough not to catch a cold and the hot water did the rest. Hot baths 
were more or less readily available in this era but the traditional 
method still had its flair, not to mention a certain health value that 
even Kagome had to acknowledge.
	At the moment we had an entire pool to ourselves which gave us 
all the privacy two girls could wish for. Especially two girls like 
us. Kagome was currently at the edge of the pool with her back turned 
to me and her head resting on her arms. I couldn&#39;t see but I had the 
feeling that she had her eyes closed as well so that she could fully 
enjoy the sensations of a thorough massage.
	My hands worked with purpose and a certain roughness that was 
needed to work out all the kinks. Not that Kagome was far from 
relaxed, but a massage never failed to please my lover. I had been 
taught how to do this by an older woman in my village. She had been 
like a mother to me and I&#39;ve learned a lot of stuff from her. Stuff 
that my father for all his skills could not teach me. From him I 
learned to fight, not how to be a woman.
	Finished with Kagome&#39;s neck, I was just about to turn my 
attention to her shoulders when I was suddenly interrupted in my 
ministrations by a somewhat astonishing sight that made both of us 
stare. Rei was chasing a giggling Sasami all over the place.
	It took both of us a few moment to regain the ability to speak 
after the pair vanished into the distance. Eventually Kagome said, 
&quot;They are making progress.&quot;
	&quot;Looks like it,&quot; I agreed, resuming my earlier task, much to the 
younger girl&#39;s pleasure. With precision I kneaded muscles so that even 
the tiniest tenseness was worked out. &quot;You are enjoying that a lot, 
aren&#39;t you?&quot; I commented, liking the effect I had on the other girl.
	&quot;You are a goddess at that, Sango,&quot; Kagome replied with a sigh. 
I had to chuckle at the remark but kept up the pace, methodically 
working lower. First over her shoulder blades, down and around her 
arms, until I found the bare flesh of her back. There was hardly a 
thing about Kagome that I didn&#39;t know intimately by now and it was 
simple enough to touch just the right spots to draw out just the right 
reactions.
	&quot;Sango?&quot; Kagome asked all of a sudden after a period of silence 
in which I continued my massage. It almost startled me. Whenever I did 
that Kagome was rather tightlipped - for the obvious reason of 
enjoying herself too much.
	&quot;Hmm?&quot;
	&quot;Are you happy being here?&quot; The question threw me for a moment, 
not making much sense, until the younger girl explained further. &quot;I 
mean. When you came with me, you were hardly in a condition to choose 
otherwise. All you wanted was to get away from it all. I understood 
that. But now, looking back...&quot; She trailed off and I finally got some 
inkling what my beautiful lover was talking about.
	&quot;What does it matter? I&#39;m here now. The past can&#39;t be changed,&quot; 
I replied casually, letting my hands wander lower, almost to the hem 
of the towel now. I had really not thought about it much. Mostly 
because I didn&#39;t want to think about it much. Remembering was too 
painful. It was much safer to stay in the here and now and concentrate 
on what I had. Kagome first and foremost.
	&quot;I would have followed you, even if all that didn&#39;t happen,&quot; I 
continued after awhile, realizing Kagome wasn&#39;t entirely satisfied 
with the answer. &quot;That is if you had wanted me to,&quot; I added. Thoughts 
like that would assume Inuyasha was still alive and there was no 
telling what my chances would have been then. Probably very slim. Who 
knows, maybe I would have even settled for Miroku as an alternative. 
He had his good points after all.
	&quot;Maybe I would have stayed if things were different,&quot; Kagome 
said wistfully and I had the impression she thought about the same 
lines as I had just now. And that made me a little sad. But I had come 
to terms with that by now. There would always be other factors, there 
would always be Inuyasha. There would always be the feeling that I 
only had Kagome now because he wasn&#39;t there anymore and we needed each 
other. &quot;Maybe I would have stayed with Inuyasha,&quot; Kagome mused, all 
but confirming my suspicion, &quot;maybe with you.&quot; Wait, that last bit was 
unexpected. &quot;You are right though. The past is done and we have to 
make the best of what we have now.&quot;
	&quot;Kagome-chan?&quot; I asked carefully, stilling the movements of my 
hands which had just slipped beneath the towel in order to reach the 
concealed area of her back better.
	The dark-haired miko shivered a little at the unmoving touch of 
my hands resting on her back. I really would have not expected her 
next words. I had thought a couple of times in the last month that she 
might be ready to say them and I would truly have accepted them in any 
form. But right now, I was thoroughly unprepared.
	&quot;I love you, Sango-chan.&quot; Kagome paused, stunned silence falling 
between us. I believe I was gaping but my body was unable to check 
right now. My heart thumped loudly. It was the first time. The first 
time that Kagome ever said those words. I might have said I didn&#39;t 
need to hear them but the fact remained that I wanted to. More than 
wanted to.
	&quot;I knew that for awhile now,&quot; my lover continued thoughtfully, 
&quot;but I needed to be sure, I needed to assure myself and I needed to be 
able to assure you that what I feel for you isn&#39;t some kind of 
substitute, that you are not a second choice because of 
circumstances.&quot; Her head slightly turned, brown eyes looked up at me 
with sincerity and... love. &quot;I thought about that a lot lately and now 
I know that I COULD have just as well chosen you if there would have 
been a choice to make. I AM certain now.&quot;
	&quot;Kagome...&quot; I whispered, feeling the rush of emotions, the giddy 
sensation in my heart, the great leaps it was performing. Gently I 
lowered my head and touched my lips to her in an awkward kiss due to 
our position. Without really thinking about it, my hands that were 
still under the towel, slipped slowly around to the other girl&#39;s 
front. The kiss became more heated and so did the atmosphere. A 
circumstance that had little to do with the hot springs. &quot;I love you 
too,&quot; I breathed into Kagome&#39;s ear huskily when we parted, making my 
lover shudder.
	&quot;M-maybe we should head inside,&quot; Kagome suggested breathlessly, 
clearly excited by now. She squealed in a mixture of surprise, protest 
and probably a good dose of arousal when I found the swell of her 
breasts under the towel.
	&quot;Nobody is here,&quot; I pointed out. &quot;And I really want to show you 
how much you mean to me, Kagome-chan.&quot;
	The younger girl soon was in no state of mind to protest.

******************************

&lt;Somewhere in space (Mizuki)&gt;
With growing irritation I stared at the transparent globe cutting off 
all exits. I had spent nearly an entire day trying to find a weak 
spot, before I finally settled on breaking through by concentrating on 
one point constantly. That process though was exhausting. I had to 
rest to not run out of reserves but could not let up for too long as 
well since the barrier would regenerate itself.
	&#39;You have to give it to her. She understands her handiwork,&#39; I 
thought bitterly. However, all the work was finally paying off. One 
spot was much too weak already. It would take just one more 
concentrated shot. The energy supply of the artificial prison was 
frantically working on repairing the damage but could not compensate 
fast enough anymore. I had allowed myself another short breather. 
Wielding so much energy over such a long span of time, near constantly 
at that, tore even at my considerably high reserves. So close to 
success though, I was not about to let fatigue stop me.
	Concentrating, I directed all my internal energy into my hands. 
Blue-white light appeared between them in form of a wide spear. Arcs 
of power sparkled around the sphere as I sought to stuff as much 
energy into it as I still could without making me pass out. I still 
had to walk afterwards. I could rest when I was free and on my way 
after my wayward mother/creator who I had to thank for my current 
predicament.
	Feeling my limit was reached I made a motion and let the 
concussive blast fly forward, ripping right through and collapsing the 
barrier as if it was merely of paper. &#39;I wish...&#39; Gasping for breath, 
I sank to my knees for a moment. I had certainly improved to a point 
where I might stand up to the Ryoko of about two years ago - of 
course, she probably improved since then as well - but that had still 
been taxing. Nearly a full day the effort had cost me and catching up 
with my mother would be hard to achieve. I had no time to lose.
	Pushing myself of the ground, I forced my body to move. Phasing 
or teleporting was out of the question. However, from here it was only 
a short distance to the outside where my best hope for regaining the 
lost time waited.
	I stumbled out of the makeshift lab that we had set up months 
ago here on the fifth planet of the Rejinau system. I had helped 
mother in researching the so called Red Star Desert and some curious 
phenomena that had been reported until just a few days ago when my 
creator began to act weird and revert to ways I had thought she had 
long aborted. I should have been warned then already but didn&#39;t act on 
it properly until it was too late.
	Just outside the large dome stood a large ship. Mother&#39;s design. 
She and I had worked on it constantly since the disaster two years 
ago. It was a smooth bird-like design. Two gracious wings were angled 
in such a way to allow maximum balance of speed and agility. The hull 
was a chromic black but unlike what one might think, it was part 
organic. Not exactly a Ouke no Ki or a second Ryo-oh-ki, but as close 
as somehow possible. It was technically finished. Unfortunately it was 
also untested.
	&#39;Well, it will be the real thing instead.&#39; With that I gathered 
my last energy to teleport the short distance onboard. Reappearing on 
the bridge, I collapsed into the command chair, brushing my green 
ponytail out of the way that had fallen in front of my face. &quot;Aquila, 
boot up all systems.&quot;
	Consoles flickered to life and little bird-like crystal units 
began to swarm the bridge. The main unit was a tad bit bigger and 
looked more humanoid, like a winged girl actually, as it dropped from 
the ceiling to greet its captain. &quot;Welcome, Mizuki-sama. Are we making 
our maiden flight?&quot;
	I smiled faintly. &quot;Something like that. Can you track my 
mother&#39;s ship from here?&quot;
	Aquila made a sound I couldn&#39;t decipher past what I would 
vaguely expect an upset bird to make. It was obvious the ship&#39;s unit 
felt offended. I was going to tell Mother to fix this. A main unit 
with some eccentric personality was nice but I could do without one 
who thought it was the best around.
	&quot;Of course I can.&quot;
	&quot;Look,&quot; I said exasperatedly. &quot;Something is wrong with her. She 
looked really out of it when she locked me in that damn prison. Took 
me nearly a day to get out.&quot; I closed my eyes taking several deep 
breaths. &quot;I really wish we had more time to get to know one another 
but I have a feeling wherever she is going, I won&#39;t like the outcome. 
Can you tell where she is heading?&quot;
	At least the semi-humanoid AI was clever enough to sense that I 
was in a mood where I could well end up blasting her units if she got 
too much on my nerves. &quot;From the data I can gather, your mother&#39;s ship 
appears to head for Colony 315.&quot;
	&quot;Earth?&quot; I wondered out loud. &quot;What would she want there?&quot; I had 
actually half feared that would once again have something to do with 
my mother&#39;s old rivalry with the genius Washu... But the entire Royal 
Family who had been residing on Earth was back at Jurai as far as 
official sources went, including Washu. Actually, new Emperor Tenchi 
had just married his wives, Princess Ayeka and Ryoko. What would my 
mother want on Earth?
	&quot;What should we do, Mizuki-sama?&quot;
	I pursed my lips in thought. &quot;It does not matter. I&#39;ll have to 
figure it out when we are there. Calculate the FASTEST course to 
Earth.&quot; It took the ship&#39;s AI a couple of seconds but then a map 
popped up showing what I had requested. A route that under other 
circumstances and with a lesser-equipped ship, I would not even have 
considered as possible. Now it was only a little dangerous. Risks I 
could and had to take in order to catch up with the woman who had 
created me before she ended doing something foolish... again.
	I really could not fathom. She seemed alright the one moment and 
then went to totally obsessed with something else, abandoning her 
actual research. Mother had not let me look but I suspected she had 
searched for something... or someone. I had been worried about her 
since she was neglecting work that she had spent months on completely. 
I had been about ready to confront her about it. That was when she 
surprised me and got me locked up. Obviously she feared my 
interference - rightfully so - in whatever she had planned.
	She must be controlled or something. There was no way my mother 
was doing this on her own. She had changed. The conflict two years ago 
had altered her and we had been getting along rather well. She had 
actually often expressed her guilt about treating me so unfairly 
before. I doubted that had all been a farce. I had to get to the 
bottom of this.
	&quot;Bring us on course, Aquila. I&#39;ll take a nap. If something comes 
up, wake me.&quot; And with that I closed my eyes right there, already 
beginning to drift into unconsciousness. The effort of breaking free 
had been even more taxing than I had thought.
	&quot;Certainly, Mizuki-sama,&quot; I heard Aquila reply before sleep 
claimed me.

******************************

(Sasami)
As often as I had seen the sight by now, being in a planetary orbit - 
especially Earth&#39;s orbit - has always invoked a sense of awe and 
wonder in me. The beauty of seeing the entire planet before you, with 
all those landmasses that seemed so tiny from your vantage point was a 
very special feeling. Obviously that was one of the reasons why people 
on Earth became astronauts. To see this spectacular view for 
themselves.
	Right now the sun was creeping around this half of the planet 
where Tsunami was circling in orbit. The brilliancy would have been 
blinding if not for the natural blenders that protected my eyes from 
the burning rays. There was hardly a comparison. Watching a sunrise - 
or sunset - on a planet and watching it from orbit in space. The 
system&#39;s star was not toned by the atmosphere and thus provided a 
whole new experience. Back on Jurai a sunrise in space was even more 
impressing than here. I would like to take Rei up here one day and 
show her... Maybe someday soon.
	I felt like we had crossed another line at the hot springs about 
a week ago. Despite our different and difficult pasts and the many 
secrets that should honestly stand in the way of a working 
relationship, a level of trust had built in barely four months time 
now that I found hard to believe and exhilaratingly thrilling. I had 
gotten to know the older girl pretty good by now and was rather sure 
that she wasn&#39;t as willingly open to share painful past experiences 
with anyone as she was with me. Not that I wanted to make her sad 
deliberately. However, those instances of openness served to warm my 
heart and further fortify my feelings.
	Slowly I got to know more about the young woman my heart 
couldn&#39;t stop thinking about anymore since we arrived on Earth in the 
beginning of April. And the more I learned, the more I wanted to be 
there for the raven-haired miko, to soothe the wounds her soul had 
suffered by lack of attention and love from family, by a childhood 
spent in loneliness that made my own experience in the feeling meager 
in comparison. I wanted to take away those burdens and show her how 
wonderful love could be.
	The only problem was that I was often rather awkward about it. 
Somehow I managed to not make many grievous mistakes yet - and the two 
I hade made, had been forgiven with surprising ease - but what I told 
Rei back at the hot springs was true. I really didn&#39;t have much 
experience in the love field. Tenchi had been a crush, a crush I 
thought was supposed to be more. That was something I was ready to 
admit to myself without trouble now. It had been unfair of me to think 
that I was in love with him just because everyone else seemed drawn to 
the Juraian Prince. I should have seen the lines of fate that were 
between him, my sister and Ryoko, and only them. That was how it was 
meant to be. But I was young, just growing into my powers, and when I 
realized that he was drifting from the rest of us - mainly Mihoshi and 
me - I had started to blame things on the political conflict after my 
parents disappearance and the ramifications of the revelation of my 
secret.
	Of course, I had a good right to blame the Holy Council and 
whoever had played their role in this, obvious signs just how infected 
the ruling body of Jurai had already become by the natural virus of 
long prosperity and relative peace. Yet, that hadn&#39;t been the entire 
reason why the gap between Tenchi and Mihoshi and myself became so 
vast. I realized now that in the end, circumstances had just managed 
to speed up the inevitable decision. Tenchi had known instinctively 
who to trust fully at his side. He had made his choice and even if 
everything had transpired differently, it would have not changed the 
outcome, for us on a personal level that is.
	Rei was different though. I felt it in every fiber of my being. 
&gt;From our very first meeting onwards there had been a gravitating force 
between us that I was unable to resist. Even with all the bad 
experiences I had just left behind. In fact, the older girl had been 
the light that pulled me out of the darkness I had felt like drowning 
in once more. I had clung to that light instinctively and that 
persistence had paid of. Or it would soon, I was certain of that. It 
had to be.
	Sighing, I turned around from the sight and my contemplating 
thoughts and walked over to the front area of the bridge. Unlike other 
starships there was barely anything that would even identify Tsunami 
as such. Oh, she could manifest a full bridge, complete with captain&#39;s 
chair, all sort of consoles and whatever the pilot desired. That 
wasn&#39;t really the nature of our connection though. Ouke no Ki and 
chosen partner were known to be bonded on a higher level, in our case 
though that bond was more than just a mere spiritual connection. We 
were nearly one unit already and I really didn&#39;t need any intermediate 
means to communicate with my other half.
	&quot;Alright, Tsunami. What did you call me up here for?&quot; I had been 
spending little time in the ship since arriving on Earth. A bit more 
than a month ago I had come to check up on events on Jurai, merely out 
of curiosity and a good dose of concerns for those I left behind. 
Seeing Tenchi finally convincing the council and taking up the mantle 
of Emperor, as well as marrying Ayeka and Ryoko, had made me feel both 
relief and regret, but also helped me to further realize the truth. 
This was how it was supposed to be. If they were able to do what 
Tsunami and I hoped for from the beginning, that was another matter 
altogether.
	This morning though, Tsunami had called me up here on an urgent 
matter when I had just been conversing with Rei&#39;s ravens Phobos and 
Deimos, or more like her spiritual guardians. I wasn&#39;t entirely 
certain what they were. Not entirely human but also not strictly 
spiritual. Enough of the latter though to immediately recognize 
Tsunami and I for what we were, or at least part of our aspects.
	Tsunami&#39;s ghost-like form appeared next to me and with a wave of 
her hand the front window displayed a map screen with a portion of the 
galaxy that I recognized of being somewhere close to here. 
Occasionally a white light would blink into existence for a mere 
moment before vanishing again just as quickly. &quot;I picked this up 
merely by coincidence a few days ago. Curious, I tried to track it 
down with a wide search and came up with those responses.&quot; White 
points appeared all over the map, located at various positions where 
they had formerly been mere glimpses. A blue line began to link them 
together and was then extended. It hit the edge of the map and another 
one was shown. I had a sinking feeling in my gut that told me even 
before the visual confirmation that the end point of what was 
obviously the objects course would be here.
	&quot;Jurai or GP?&quot; I asked hopefully. As annoying as it would be to 
be found so quickly - and surprising too - it would at least be a not 
so troubling occurrence. I was certain I could deal with that, 
somehow.
	Tsunami shook her head and my heart fell. &quot;I would know about 
the former before one even left and the second I would be able to 
identify without problem.&quot; What was implied here didn&#39;t sit very well 
with me. It almost sounded like the most powerful ship of the galaxy 
wasn&#39;t able to identify the object at all. I raised an eyebrow in 
question. The troubled look directed back at me was an obvious sign 
that I was closer to the truth than I hoped. &quot;It is hard enough to 
keep track of the ship. I cannot even tell for certain that it is one. 
There is something very strong cloaking it. Something familiar, too. 
It was by mere chance that I even picked it up.&quot;
	&quot;What are we going to do?&quot; I asked, at a loss of what to make of 
this. Technically it could be everything. There wasn&#39;t even a reason 
to believe that the ship or whatever it was wanted anything from us. 
However, the mere fact that Tsunami had trouble to penetrate whatever 
was shielding it from view, left hardly any other conclusion. Cases 
like this usually had to do something with us. Or they usually had 
something to do with Jurai, the Royal Family and the like. Everyone 
else was back on Jurai though, which only left us.
	But no one was supposed to know that we were here.
	It took us awhile to agree on a course of action.

(Hitomi)
I strode through the halls of the local college, gliding through the 
masses of students and guests. Azabu Junior College was hardly a big 
place but in recent years known for its success in the business field. 
However, there was also the uprising branch of old history, especially 
focusing on myths and legends. Like a special one that I was fairly 
interested in and which was the main subject of an open lecture today.
	Atlantis.
	Nearly two years had passed now since my adventures on Earth&#39;s 
mysterious shadow planet called Gaea and I was now in my last year of 
High School. It was time to look for a university or college to 
attend. That was only secondary for my visit today. I was more 
interested in the lecture, hoping to receive some insight, some theory 
I had not heard yet. Something new to give me a different perspective, 
an innovative lead, anything...
	Before my adventures on Earth&#39;s shadow planet - or whatever you 
wanted to call Gaea - I would have hardly thought I&#39;d ever do 
something in the field of history. I had always been more inclined in 
sport activities, like running track. Sitting around in libraries, 
taking hours to go through old, dusty books had never been my idea of 
fun.
	People changed, I guess. I had become rather interested in old 
myths and legends, especially the ones concerning Atlantis. What I had 
learned on Gaea intrigued me and I had that nagging sense that there 
was more to the story of the ancient empire when I knew now. There had 
been so many questions left unanswered in the aftermath of the 
conflict I had been drawn into.
	When all was said and done with, I had been content with living 
my life normally again. Over time though I had come across a few 
curious discoveries that had awakened my interest. And there was still 
the question of my heritage. My mother had not been very helpful 
but... I had the inkling feeling that there was more than just the 
genes of a simple earthling in me. Why else would Dornkirk have deemed 
me so important? And why did I have these abilities?
	It wasn&#39;t the pendant. I had thought so at first. But then I had 
left it with Van but it had made hardly a difference. Not that I had 
to actively use them like on Gaea since then but small incidents 
hinted that I still could do everything I had been able to with the 
pendant in my possession. My guess was that it was merely meant as a 
focus.
	There was a purpose for me, other than Gaea I mean, in this 
world. And I needed to find it. There was the irresistible impulse to 
find that purpose that had driven me onwards the last years, directing 
my life in a new direction, with a new goal. I could not entirely tell 
why but I felt that something was going to happen. Tomorrow, next 
month, in a few years. I honestly couldn&#39;t tell. I didn&#39;t need a 
vision to tell me that. It was a feeling of certainty anchored deep in 
my heart.
	&#39;Or maybe I just want to forget about HIM for awhile,&#39; I thought 
somewhat sarcastically but chastened myself immediately for the 
thought. I had already began to travel down this path when Van and I 
had started to drift apart. No, that wasn&#39;t exactly the correct term. 
Our lives had merely continued and we had grown up. What had once been 
between us had morphed over time, changed. The intensity of our 
connection had weakened somewhat. We had realized that we lived in 
different worlds and that this was the way it was supposed to be. 
There would simply be no permanent &quot;us&quot;.
	That&#39;s why it was alright with me that he was pursuing a 
different relationship. Really it was.
	I sighed heavily. It seemed as much as I tried to rationalize 
and as much truth was in that reasoning, there would always remain a 
part of me that was jealous and... disappointed. But that part was 
joined by another that pointed out that if I wanted to start throwing 
around the blame that I should point as much of it at myself as the 
jealous part of me pointed at him. That usually helped to settle the 
matter. I was more or less over it and in fact I was happy for Van. He 
was much happier these days even if barely anyone had suspected the 
unlikely match. They were my friends still and I should be happy.
	Despite having a rather small campus - compared to others in the 
country - Azabu Junior College would still pose some trouble in 
orientation for a newcomer. They all did. Then again, no one had my 
kind of abilities that would tell me instinctively where to go. I was 
hardly looking where I was going and still found myself in the 
appropriate building before two heavy double doors that lead - as a 
glance at the room number indicated - to the lecture hall I had been 
searching for.
	Glancing around I found some people milling around outside while 
the majority had probably already claimed seats inside. On a 
blackboard next to the entrance of the hall stood a curious looking 
group. Four girls of varying ages, with the youngest seemingly around 
fourteen and the oldest possible twenty. There was something 
undeniably peculiar about them that compelled me to step closer, 
curious about the strange feeling I got around the group.
	When I came closer, I spotted what they were doing. A note was 
being attached to the board, a request for part time help as it 
seemed. My ability was telling me that those four were important for 
me in some way and so I made my presence known by clearing my throat. 
The four girls turned around, not so much startled, but actually more 
curious. As if they had known I was there without even looking... 
Interesting.
	&quot;Ah. You are looking for help at your Jinja?&quot; I asked, getting a 
better look at the petition now.
	&quot;We are,&quot; the oldest one with the long black hair said.
	&quot;Are you interested?&quot; one of the younger girls, who had similar 
black hair, asked.
	I considered the question for a moment. On the one hand I wasn&#39;t 
really looking for a part time job. The possible money was tempting 
though and my senses were telling me to get to know these four better. 
I had met many priests and the like in my line of research on Atlantis 
and other mystical places who thought themselves knowledgeable or 
skilled but didn&#39;t impress me very much. These four girls though all 
had a feel of skill and experience around them. On first glance they 
were rather eccentric and hard to connect as a group in one&#39;s mind. 
However, all of them were quite powerful.
	Was it possible that the attraction I could feel now was leading 
me a step further in my search for my purpose? I had followed my 
instinct here and thought it was supposed to be the lecture. Maybe it 
was these people instead?
	&quot;Maybe,&quot; I answered carefully. &quot;I am finishing High School next 
year and might be attending here, although I&#39;m not certain about that. 
I wasn&#39;t thinking about any side jobs but...&quot; I gave a smile before I 
continued, looking forward to their reactions, &quot;If you are in need of 
a capable seer? I could find some time in the afternoon, I&#39;m sure.&quot;
	This time I wasn&#39;t really surprised to be meet by curiosity and 
interest instead of disbelief. They had most definitely experienced 
enough supernatural already and could probably sense that there was 
some credibility to my claim. &quot;Are your visions the product of skill 
or intuition,&quot; the oldest one asked, obviously the nominal leader. She 
seemed to young to be a priestess, probably the most skilled miko of 
the Jinja.
	&quot;The latter I would say,&quot; I answered and received a nod. &quot;I am 
also rather precise in locating both objects and people if I am 
familiar with them.&quot; Rather precise was an understatement since the 
years had heightened my ability of drowsing to the point of near 
perfection. It dwindled a little when I only had a bare sense of what 
I was looking for but the more defined an image in my mind, the more I 
could guarantee success.
	The four girls were exchanging looks before they turned back to 
me. The oldest once again spoke up. &quot;I&#39;m Hino Rei. I&#39;m running Hikawa 
Jinja with my grandfather. Why don&#39;t you step by tomorrow and we can 
talk about the job?&quot;
	I smiled politely, ignoring the hand. There was no telling just 
what I would find out these days by touching someone. My precognitive 
abilities were increasing and just as all my others had not been 
limited to Gaea alone. It became kind of scary at times and I&#39;d rather 
respect other people&#39;s privacy than involuntarily invading it. &quot;That 
sounds good to me. I am Kanzaki Hitomi by the way.&quot; I glanced back at 
the door and the clock above it. &quot;I think the lecture is starting 
soon.&quot;

******************************

(Rei)
We had talked about this long and hard. It had actually - once again - 
been Sasami who proposed the idea, commenting on how much easier it 
was for all of us if we could share work like this, each bringing in 
their individual skills. There was hardly anything to argue with. And 
still, a few months ago... I should really stop that. This was the 
present and I had become a lot more open about these things.
	Unfortunately it was hard to not constantly marvel about the 
effect the youngest member of our group had on me. I&#39;ve hardly ever 
felt so relaxed and simply good in my life before. Things at the Jinja 
were looking up, I had made a couple of new friends to which I had 
developed a deeper kinship similar to my fellow Senshi, my 
relationship with the latter had also been strengthened in turn... And 
the most amazing thing was that the blue-haired girl had been able to 
reach a place in my heart that I had thought long locked. Tightly and 
beyond anyone&#39;s abilities to reach.
	Maybe there was really someone meant for any of us? Maybe it had 
just taken this long to happen for me? And now, at a point in my life 
where I didn&#39;t think it possible anymore, that someone had shown up 
after all.
	Thoughts like these weren&#39;t as rare as they used to be in the 
last months since Sasami&#39;s quasi confession. There was no need to say 
the words since her actions that day spoke for themselves. I had 
started to think long and hard about it. I still was no closer to a 
solution, at least on a logical plain. Instinctual the rest of me 
seemed to have made its decision already. I barely could resist the 
pull anymore that was between us and maybe I wouldn&#39;t even try 
anymore, if not...
	I had told her already and she seemed to accept that. Despite 
her reassurances I was still scared. Scared of screwing things up like 
my father had. It had been difficult to admit that to myself so 
directly, but that was the truth. I didn&#39;t want to make the same 
mistakes. I didn&#39;t wish to make the one girl, who had brought more 
life with her mere presence into my life than anyone before, unhappy.
	In the end the outcome seemed inevitable and I knew that I had 
to make a decision soon. Kagome&#39;s subtle warning was still spooking 
around in my head. It had been words from experience and I had come to 
respect the other girl&#39;s counsel. Not just in matters concerning the 
Jinja, but personally as well. And besides, this was not a situation 
beneficial for both of us, Sasami and myself. It had been well over 
two months now since Sasami confronted me with her feelings and while 
she said I should take my time, I could tell she was getting anxious 
about an answer.
	&#39;But don&#39;t you already have an answer?&#39; The thought once again 
reared its ugly head. You can&#39;t even refuse her anything. Which was 
true enough. I had been reluctant than Sasami had brought up the 
suggestion to get a bit more help around the Jinja. The four of us 
were managing just fine and with my grandfather being close to full 
recovery there shouldn&#39;t be a need. On the other hand it was hard to 
ignore the obvious advantages of capable help. Which was what I 
eventually agreed on. One or two more pairs of capable hands would 
probably do some good. We had made a bit of money and so a part-time 
petition was a good option.
	Grandfather had agreed readily when I told him about that, 
agreeing that Hikawa Jinja definitely profited from the young and 
vivid girls these days. I was entirely certain if the comment was 
directed more at &quot;young&quot; and &quot;girls&quot; or at &quot;vivid&quot;... Grandfather 
could get a little... unbefitting one of this age at times.
	This Hitomi seemed to fit my stipulation on first glance. I 
sensed indeed some talent in her. Unique and quite potent like every 
one of our group so far. It would need some closer examination of 
course but this one might as well fit in just fine with us. I didn&#39;t 
have much time to pay further attention though since the lecturer had 
already arrived.
	When we had gotten inside, the hall was already rather full. I 
probably hadn&#39;t come to listen if I had been on my own but Kagome and 
Sango had both voiced an interest to the public lecture and Sasami had 
been curious. Curious about what remained to be seen. I had the vague 
suspicion that she just wanted to see the place I was studying at. Not 
that I minded, of course.
	We were making an odd group, that was for sure. I hadn&#39;t made 
many acquaintances here yet and knew most people more on a passing 
basis. We had been drawing quite some attention wandering over the 
campus. However, I really didn&#39;t care that much. Let them think what 
they want. I knew now where my friends were and who I could trust. 
That was enough for me.
	We were seated somewhere in the back. Kagome and Sango were a 
row in front of us with the other girl, Hitomi, off to the left 
somewhere. Sasami was next to me. An arrangement that came natural 
these days and hardly called for attention on my part anymore. When 
the lecture began I could not help but notice some curious reactions 
from both the girl we just met outside and my younger companion. Their 
reactions seemed to mirror each other, at least they seemed to 
disagree on the same points with a surprising certainty, Sasami 
shaking her head a bit more often though. I was only half listening 
but interestingly enough Mars was giving me the same kind of feedback.
	I tried to think back what I knew of Atlantis from the Silver 
Millennium. I knew it existed, a long time ago even before my prior 
incarnation. All that I knew of were history texts from the Royal 
Library and from what I could recall they seemed to contradict the 
common myth on some points. Now, was it just that those two thought 
what the lecturer said was wrong or did they KNOW it was wrong? I 
shook my head with a smile. Maybe I was really starting to interpret 
too much. Not everything I thought odd had to have some truth behind 
it after all.
	My attention was drawn back to the older man in the front when I 
was unpleasantly reminded why I would have not considered to go on my 
own. He was a historian, alright, but also both teaching politics and 
actively participating in a political party as far I knew. I had hoped 
he would leave the lecture free of such influences and stick to the 
historical and mythical aspects. Unfortunately that didn&#39;t seem to be 
the case.
	I wondered how many here really wanted to know about inner 
political conflicts and power struggles that in the opinion of the 
lecturer led to the eventual destruction of Atlantis. The sad truth 
was different and for once Mars and I were on one mind that we didn&#39;t 
like the direction he was taking the lecture. From what I could recall 
from my past life&#39;s studies, Atlantis had been one of the more tragic 
chapters in the early histories of the Silver Millennium.
	&quot;This shows us once more a common theme that is repeated 
throughout histories. Many great empires fall, contrary to popular 
belief, not alone through a stronger opposition or rebellion. No, the 
ground work was often done by inner disharmony, political conflict, 
intrigues... You can continue the list on your own, I am certain. Over 
time every empire will eventually fall to the side effects of 
prosperity and wealth...&quot;
	I drowned out the rest of the words, overcome by a sudden wave 
of memories. Ironically it wasn&#39;t really due to my own background in 
this life or that I even disagreed with the man. It was the sad truth 
reflected in the words that could also been applied to the tragic end 
of the Moon Kingdom and the Silver Millennium era.
	Not really thinking about it, I got up and excused myself, 
slipping out of the lecture hall.

******************************

(Sasami)
I had been listening intently until that point. At least the older man 
had gotten some of the things right. I didn&#39;t really blame him. That 
was a time long lost to humanity and what remained were mostly 
speculations and wild theories. That the picture constructed was even 
remotely similar was amazing enough. Of course, I knew the entire 
story. Or better Tsunami did. She might have gone her own way, yet she 
had always tried to keep an eye on her sister&#39;s kingdom as best as was 
possible for her.
	Testament to our growing attachment was that I knew 
instinctively the point where it became uncomfortable for the older 
girl next to me. I turned to look at her at just the precise moment 
she got up to excuse herself. Amazing to some maybe. However, if you 
spent so much time on trying to figure out all the little details and 
quirks about your love interest, it is not all that surprising.
	Worried I followed her slip out of the hall. While I had somehow 
figured out when she was going to be upset, I could only suspect what 
it was. I had the nagging feeling there was something more that 
provoked the reaction just now than the usual. Rei had been much more 
relaxed the last weeks. Opening up to me like that at the hot springs 
had not only helped me to get to know her better, but obviously also 
served to filter out some of those negative emotions she kept bottling 
up.
	Leaning forward I tapped Kagome on the shoulder and whispered 
something in her ear. Before she could even really register what I had 
said, I was already moving to follow the older miko. Some might think 
I was cramping her privacy but I couldn&#39;t help myself. True, maybe it 
would be better to leave her to herself sometimes. I wanted to keep 
her company though. So that she didn&#39;t feel all too alone, because she 
wasn&#39;t, alone that is.
	&quot;Tsunami?&quot; I mumbled.
	*Yes?*
	&quot;Please stop me next time I start babbling in my head.&quot;
	I could hear a soft giggle reverberating in my mind. *I will 
try.*
	Maybe that was what my older sister and Ryoko had felt courting 
Tenchi? When I had been younger and my crush not so distinct yet, I 
had often watched them acting totally silly, trying to get Tenchi&#39;s 
attention. Especially Ayeka was usually a very composed girl with 
perfect manners thanks to her training as first princess - not that 
she didn&#39;t hate it sometimes. For her to act like this, so unlike her 
normal pattern, so carefree and normal... It might look childish to 
some but was actually refreshing for me to see...
	And I was getting off the topic again.
	The point was that I was never really like that with Tenchi. It 
was all very exciting, true. On the other hand I had to admit that I 
was dreaming most of the time. Dreaming more than actual acting to 
make these dreams true. I expected things to happen on their own, and 
that wasn&#39;t really what love was supposed to be like. Right? I really 
had no idea. However, if I had ever felt real love it was now. With 
and for Rei. I caught myself getting distracted - like staring at the 
raven-haired beauty for long periods of time - so often it was 
embarrassing. But at the same time the connection between us was 
deepening and I was given enough reasons to believe that we were meant 
for each other.
	I found Rei outside, sitting on one of the benches. The yard 
between the buildings here was devoid of other students. I approached 
her slowly. Before I came even close to the bench, the older girl 
suddenly looked up and I was startled by the haunted look in purple 
eyes. &quot;Are you my personal shadow now?&quot;
	I jerked back from the bitterness in the tone. I could hardly 
fathom what had gotten her so worked up. As I said, she had been so 
much better since we spoke over her feelings for her father and his 
chosen profession. It couldn&#39;t be that now, could it? I took a step 
backwards, unsure of what to do. Maybe it would have been better to 
leave her alone after all. Rei was a rather private person after all 
and always having someone follow her around... &quot;I...&quot;
	I didn&#39;t get any further with my apology as the bitterness in 
her eyes was replaced by startled realization. Looking to the side I 
caught a mumbled apology and instantly knew - and was relieved - that 
obviously the reaction had just been one of her temper eruptions 
again, sparked by whatever had upset her. She didn&#39;t want to snap at 
me.
	I took another two steps in her direction before tentatively 
asking, &quot;If you want to be alone...?&quot; I could understand if she wanted 
to be alone. Now that I was certain she knew that I was just 
concerned, I wouldn&#39;t mind to give the older girl some privacy. I 
didn&#39;t want to be a pain after all. And neither did I want to get too 
clingy or pushy. Had done that once already and look where it lead to. 
But Rei hadn&#39;t minded before...
	Rei shook her head and surprisingly reached out to touch my arm, 
startling me away from another mental rant. &quot;No. Stay.&quot;
	I was too surprised to say or do anything other than comply. 
After I sat down next to her, I got my second surprise when Rei pulled 
me closer with one arm around my shoulders. &quot;Rei?&quot; I asked carefully 
but was met with my silence as the miko looked up into the sky. My 
eyes fluttered close for awhile as we sat like this, an air of 
peacefulness engulfing us, like nothing could touch us. My concern was 
washed away when I felt Rei relax in the intimate contact - probably 
the first the other girl had initiated on her own, at least on that 
scale.
	&quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot; I asked after awhile of this 
peaceful silence, barely even daring to disturb it.
	Rei finally looked at me and all that was left of the former 
haunting shadow was some nostalgic sadness. &quot;Not really.&quot; She smiled a 
little. It was weak but a genuine effort, reassuring me that she was 
indeed alright.
	&quot;Okay,&quot; I replied, seeing no need in pushing the issue further. 
Whatever had overcome my potential mate had obviously been rather 
fleeting. Intense but fleeting. And pretty much gone now. &quot;I was just 
a little worried,&quot; I admitted, realizing Rei was surprised by my easy 
acceptance of her answer.
	This time the smile was a little brighter. And did I imagine 
this or did her face just glow a little? &quot;It&#39;s nice to have someone 
worry about you,&quot; the older miko admitted honestly and I was pretty 
sure that I did glow at the comment! A few butterflies were definitely 
performing a mad dance in my stomach right now. While I had probably 
seen more of this hidden side of Rei in a few months than anyone else 
who knew her, compliments like this - and there was no mistaking that 
this was meant to be one - were always making me gleefully happy. Any 
doubts I might have about whether or not this could work out were 
eliminated by even the tiniest bit of progress from Rei&#39;s side since I 
knew how hard it was for her to work past all her inner barriers.
	Instances like this, with such sudden great leaps in closeness, 
were rare but happened more frequently lately. And so I dared to be a 
little forward myself. The taller girl tensed up at first when I 
leaned into her, settling my head just above her chest, basking in the 
warmth the contact provided. I almost thought I had went too far when 
Rei relaxed once more, her arm around me tightening a bit.
	&quot;I want to make you happy,&quot; I admitted softly, seeing no 
resistance from Rei. &quot;I didn&#39;t plan on this though.&quot; Which was true. 
When Tsunami and I left Jurai, hardly had I imagined to find something 
like this. We didn&#39;t even have a destination or purpose in mind at 
first. But then I had found and met my purpose by mere chance. No, not 
by mere chance. Things like that didn&#39;t happen through coincidence. I 
should know. Peitho had always told me - err, Tsunami - often enough. 
&quot;When I came here, all I was looking for was a place to stay. Then I 
met you and... Now I can&#39;t stop thinking about you.&quot;
	&quot;Miko-chan...&quot; Rei&#39;s voice was thick with emotion and I was 
about to look up, wondering if I made her uncomfortable but refrained 
from doing so when I felt one hand stroking my hair softly. Just for a 
few moments but it was another leap in closeness. And it felt so 
wonderful and nice. &quot;You do make me happy,&quot; the older miko continued 
in a whisper - which was not the entire reason why I thought I 
misheard. &quot;I never felt better than in the last months.&quot; My heart was 
absorbing all this greedily. My eyes closed once again, savoring the 
feeling of being so close to Rei as long as it would last.
	That was all the other girl said and after a time I felt her 
shift a little awkwardly. Obviously the moment had passed. I wasn&#39;t 
too disappointed though when I pulled away. I was beyond a doubt 
certain now that Rei was the right one for me and that those feelings 
weren&#39;t one-sided but mutual, in the entire spectrum. I just needed to 
be a little more patient now.
	&quot;Sa...&quot; Rei began but I silenced her with one finger to the 
lips.
	&quot;Do you want to go home? I told Kagome that we might not be 
around afterwards.&quot;
	Rei grinned, eyes full of relief and gratefulness. &quot;My 
thoughtful girl.&quot; She stood up and surprised me once again by pulling 
me upwards with a yelp, her right arm linked firmly with my left. 
&quot;Let&#39;s see if we can find something more fun to do than boring 
lectures.&quot;
	I happily complied, skipping along as we made our way off 
campus. Rei didn&#39;t seem to mind the stares we were getting.

******************************

(Sango)
The lecture had ended a couple minutes ago and the sea of students and 
guests had mostly ebbed up by now. I was still rather amazed at the 
vast amount of people coming together to listen to one teacher. In my 
time I would have had a hard time getting anyone to believe that was 
possible. A lot of things about this time and age were mind-boggling 
and even over a year later, I still found myself awed at some of the 
things I&#39;ve encountered.
	Maybe that was why I hardly had gotten out from Kagome&#39;s home. A 
neglect that began to show now that I was trying to socialize more, 
spent more time as a normal girl. I actually liked being a normal 
girl, doing things others in this time might enjoy. I felt closer to 
Kagome this way and it helped enormously in my effort to restart my 
life here. Also, growing up I had never had quite a normal childhood. 
Being raised in a village of taijiya was definitely different from 
what normal children in my time had been used to. It was nice to be a 
normal GIRL for once.
	Too long had I sat around idly, my situation stagnating. Not 
anymore though. I had resolved in the last months spent with the other 
girls at Hikawa that I finally needed to get my life back in order. 
After all I had the best companion for that who was obviously willing 
to share the effort and burden now. The dark mist that had surrounded 
both of us for such a long time was finally beginning to dissipate and 
spending time with my lover was not just merely an act of comfort and 
distraction anymore but genuine affection and... love.
	&quot;They don&#39;t seem to be here anymore,&quot; Kagome commented, looking 
up and down the hallway for our wayward, would-be couple. Sasami had 
told Kagome that, should they decide to wait for us, they&#39;d waiting 
outside. After giving them some time to show up, talking a little to 
the other girl who had shown an interest in working at the Jinja, it 
was obvious that they were long gone already. I wasn&#39;t overly worried. 
Whatever had happened, those two seemed to be able to resolve things 
on their own.
	&quot;Who knows?&quot; I shrugged. &quot;Maybe they are already making out 
without us knowing.&quot; I grinned at the dark-haired girl.
	&quot;No way!&quot; Kagome exclaimed. &quot;I don&#39;t think they are that far 
already.&quot; She rubbed her chin thoughtfully. &quot;Then again. They&#39;ve been 
awfully close lately... and happy. They wouldn&#39;t rush things like this 
though.&quot;
	Which was true enough. Ever since the trip to the hot springs 
something had changed. Where before gestures and touches were more 
covert, they had become more open, to a point where even Rei didn&#39;t 
seem to mind if someone saw and interpreted them. It seemed more like 
a unconscious thing. The innocence of love, I mused, with a bit more 
than just a pang of regret.
	&quot;I envy them,&quot; I said out loud, making Kagome turn to look at me 
curiously. &quot;I mean. They have all the time in the world to make sure 
that this is really what they want. They have the freedom of choice 
and the luxury of exploring without...&quot; I trailed off, cursing myself 
for involuntarily ruining my mood. Making the effort for a fresh start 
was one thing, successfully pulling it off was another thing. Just 
because things were looking up more now, didn&#39;t mean that the past 
wouldn&#39;t surface at the one time or the other.
	I looked down, feeling my hand being squeezed, and then up again 
to gaze into compassionate brown eyes. &quot;Why don&#39;t we go somewhere else 
and relax for awhile? I&#39;m sure our love birds would like to have time 
for themselves.&quot; She winked mischievously which made me immediately 
feel lighter. I was eternally grateful to have Kagome there with me. 
Without her, I doubted I would have made it even a day after all that 
happened.
	&quot;Ice cream?&quot; I asked hopefully, making the other girl giggle.
	&quot;You are really addicted, aren&#39;t you?&quot;
	I just grinned in answer and tugged at her hand. I couldn&#39;t help 
it. Ever since Kagome had first introduced me to the sweet taste of 
ice cream, I was instantly hooked.

******************************

	Yes, ice cream definitely was one of my favorite things in this 
modern age. And enjoying a big sundae at a local shop with the girl 
who literally meant the world to me was definitely high on the list of 
most favorite things overall. It was around midday and the shop, 
called &quot;Crown Fruit Parlor&quot; was well-visited from what I could tell. 
We had come here a couple of times already, ever since our first 
official &quot;date&quot;. I had been so delighted when Kagome had asked me. I 
wasn&#39;t entirely certain at first what the term meant but quickly found 
out it was obviously an important step of courting in this age. A 
stage that usually came before actually expressing affections but... 
oh well. Who cared? It was the intention that counted after all. And I 
had felt rather smitten at that time and still did.
	I felt like a girl in love for once and not what they&#39;d call a 
tomboy here who spent the greater part of her time training for and 
exterminating youkai. Not that I had ever hated or questioned what I 
did. I just had never known a different way. That is how I grew up and 
there was nothing to be changed about it. It didn&#39;t mean I had been 
totally robbed of my femininity. Hardly that. I just never got much of 
a chance to live it out.
	This age was relatively peaceful though, there was no reason to 
constantly fight. At first I had found that odd and was uncomfortable 
about it, wondering what I was supposed to do with my time. I had 
never learnt anything else. Also, the rush of a fight was often 
helping to distract me from my problems, especially after Naraku. In 
the middle of a battle, I could often lose myself completely, not 
needing to think about Kohaku, my father and the other dead members of 
my village.
	I was slowly finding my place. Working at the shrines in this 
era was rather simple and I had had enough spiritual training to 
easily fit in. I never saw myself as a priestess, miko or other kind 
of spiritualist but it was a start, something to do now that I didn&#39;t 
need to fight so often anymore. And I thought that I could actually 
start to like it. I doubted I could ever reach the level of the other 
three. We were making a good team, however, and I wanted to contribute 
my own part to that team.
	&quot;Enjoying yourself, I see,&quot; Kagome teased from her place next to 
me. She reached out to swipe a bit of ice cream from my chin that I 
hadn&#39;t even realized was there. I had been too engrossed in savoring 
my sundae and Kagome&#39;s presence. A slight blush probably rose to my 
cheeks but was quickly covered again. It was nice to see a happy, more 
lively Kagome again. I hadn&#39;t even fully realized just how much I 
missed that.
	She had such a wonderful, easygoing spirit that had drawn me 
instantly from the first time I met her until I realized at last that 
I was totally caught under her spell. The last year she had been so 
depressed and melancholic, not unlike me. Some good time in bed for 
mutual comfort was hardly making up for the loss of that beautiful 
smile. And that was the honest truth, believe me or not.
	&quot;Sango!&quot; Kagome laughed lightly, pointing at where I just 
realized more ice cream was running down my face. I realized to my 
growing embarrassment I had been staring at the other girl for some 
time and paid no intention to consuming the sweet - but now rather 
sticky - food...
	&quot;Err...&quot; I said intelligently, trying to catch everything with 
my hands before it ended up ruining my clothes. Kagome smiled and 
offered me a handkerchief. &quot;Thanks.&quot; I wiped away the excess ice cream 
and began to work on the rest before it completely melted away, all 
the way silently enjoying my companion&#39;s chipper and happy mood. We 
were both getting out of our shell again and if that wasn&#39;t an event 
to celebrate, I wasn&#39;t sure what was.

******************************

(Kagome)
Evening had come around on the day after we went to the lecture and I 
found myself outside in the yard of our new home for no particular 
reason. New home. I hadn&#39;t even realized that until now but giving the 
notion some thought, it was obvious that was that it had become in the 
few months we&#39;ve been here. I had been a little doubtful at first and 
mostly went along with the idea because I agreed with my grandfather 
that a change in scenery would be good for Sango. In the end it had 
turned out to be good for both of us. I had spent a lot of time 
reflecting the last months, actually facing all that which happened in 
the past, and I had managed to slowly come to terms with it.
	I could not allow to let the present and future pass me by like 
that. I had to get my life back into order again and concentrate on 
the here and now. I had Sango who loved me dearly and I was certain 
that Inuyasha would have wanted me happy and not to be dragged down 
like this. It wasn&#39;t easy but I was trying now. What good did his 
sacrifice do after all if I walked through life like a zombie? I had 
to chuckle at the thought.
	And I hadn&#39;t lost everyone after all. I still had Sango - and 
Kirara although she tended to hang around more with Sasami than us 
these days - and I should concentrate on being happy with her. She was 
obviously making an effort and that in turn had inspired me to do the 
same. I did love her after all. What I told her was the truth. I had 
known the depth of my feelings for a long time now. The spark had been 
there long before everything had gone to pieces. However, whenever I 
had really given the possibility some thought it had been in 
situations where I was preoccupied with other, more troubling 
thoughts, mostly about Inuyasha. And I had began to doubt my 
developing feelings for the taijiya then. It had hardly been fair to 
her to make a declaration of love being less than certain. I wasn&#39;t 
that type, and besides it had taken me long enough to realize I was in 
love with Inuyasha...
	Lately I tried to envision what it might have been like without 
the hanyou in the picture, and had to admit that there always had been 
a certain bond between us from the start but I was too focused on my 
primary interest to really notice it. Technically Sango and I were 
rather different. She was a born fighter who tried to bury her 
emotions under a mask of self-control, whereas I had never liked 
fighting and would rather see people happy than hurt. And still we had 
bonded immediately.
	It left me to wonder who I was MEANT to be with in the first 
place. I didn&#39;t love Sango less than Inuyasha, I was certain about 
that by now. Just different. I had no idea if there was really 
something behind the concept of soul mates but if there was, I 
honestly couldn&#39;t say who was supposed to be mine.
	I jumped slightly, feeling a hand on my shoulder. &quot;Easy. I just 
came to tell you that dinner is almost ready,&quot; Sango said as she 
stepped next to me. I had to have been rather preoccupied to not 
notice her. My senses were much sharper these days and with Sango I 
could usually always tell when she was nearby. I could feel concerned 
eyes on me and turned to look at the slightly older girl. &quot;You are 
tense,&quot; the taijiya commented bluntly but didn&#39;t elaborate further. It 
wasn&#39;t really necessary.
	To tell the truth, there was actually a reason why I was out 
here. There was no sense in denying that I felt troubled. Rei and I 
had &#39;interviewed&#39; the new girl, Hitomi, earlier in the day. She turned 
out to be as skilled as she said, probably even more so. We had her 
target shooting with bow and arrow, something both Rei and I were more 
or less experts on. Hitomi had hit the bulls eye several times in a 
row WITH HER EYES CLOSED before we called a stop to that particular 
test. I had to admit I was impressed. I might be able to do it when I 
concentrated hard enough but the ease with which this Hitomi did it 
was uncanny. It was quite obvious that she was using senses other than 
her primary ones. I personally had never met a seer but Kikyou did and 
that girl came close enough.
	And then there was the unexpected vision, or whatever it was. 
That wasn&#39;t even planned. Hitomi had told us that she couldn&#39;t control 
the ability. What she saw was more instinctual than an ability she 
could utilize at will. Both Rei and I had been rather uneasy when she 
suddenly went into one, foretelling some kind of danger in the very 
close future. Oh, that alone wouldn&#39;t have made us uneasy. Rei and I 
had talked afterwards and it turned out that we both had picked up 
something unnatural approaching. Having our mutual suspicions 
confirmed this way was more than a little unsettling.
	&quot;This place is special. It&#39;s like a spiritual node that attracts 
higher forces. Both good and evil,&quot; I said to Sango in a way of an 
answer, voicing an observation I had made some time ago. On first 
glance Hikawa seemed like an ordinary family jinja. Not much different 
from our own. However, both location and the spiritual power that 
flowed through and came together at this place, suggested a greater 
purpose than what was obvious from casual observation. It was hardly 
surprising for me that so many different and unusual gifted people, 
like us, had been drawn here. Our meeting here was hardly a 
coincidence. It almost seemed like we were drawn together here for a 
greater task in the future.
	Sango next to me nodded, not really needing for me to explain 
out loud. Her own senses were pretty sharp and I was pretty sure she 
had picked up in the shift of atmosphere as well. &quot;But it&#39;s our home 
now,&quot; she said quietly, picking up my earlier train of thought. &quot;We 
have friends here, again. Good friends...&quot; The other girl trailed off, 
leaving the hidden meaning for me to pick up.
	What had been constructed in the last months between the four of 
us was a harmonizing group where everyone could contribute with their 
talents, much like what we had had with Inuyasha and the others. I had 
missed this family-like atmosphere and seeing it develop once more, 
with different people now, made me kind of nostalgic but also happy. 
The bond that developed between us was an instant one and it had 
helped to get both Sango and I to concentrate more on the present than 
thinking about our darker past.
	Determined eyes met my own in a moment of solemn agreement. 
Whatever was out there to threaten the harmony of our new group would 
not succeed in shattering it. Not again. Not if we had something to 
say about this. The events of post-Naraku had pretty much shattered 
whatever still existed between those of us who had survived. The 
things that had happened, had alienated us too much. The friendship 
was still there but we couldn&#39;t stay together anymore, each for their 
own different reasons.
	Nodding firmly to each other the decision was made and sealed. 
We could not effort a repeat of this. This was a new chance that been 
offered to us and we weren&#39;t going to waste it. Already we owed a lot 
to both our hostess and the younger Sasami, both having contributed to 
our recovery during the last months. If it was in our power, we would 
see to it that nothing destroyed the close friendship beginning to 
form between us.

******************************

(Rei)
For anyone who didn&#39;t spend the last couple of months in Masaki 
Sasami&#39;s presence - close presence at that - it might have been rather 
tough to locate her. Her unusual aura that created no disturbances 
whatsoever at any place she went to - something all living things did 
when they were not inside the Wa of their home - could make her close 
to invisible, even to those gifted enough to read and detect auras.
	It hardly took me more than a minute to locate her behind the 
big tree in the yard. Our bond had developed to this point already. 
Another thing I found harder and harder to ignore over time. I was 
still scared but... that feeling was drowned out more and more lately 
by those other feelings. Feelings I thought I&#39;d never have, again, and 
yet were as clear now as the sun rose every day.
	I had been doomed the moment we met, I realized when I looked 
back now, wondering just how this could have happened. Whatever had 
passed between us had latched onto my heart and would not let go, 
slowly infecting it. And now I could not get the younger girl out of 
my mind anymore. She was already at home in my heart. All that was 
left now was for me to admit it... Which wasn&#39;t all that easy. Sasami 
knew. And as much as it had been hard for me to talk about this, I was 
eternally grateful that she did. It gave me the assurance that she 
wouldn&#39;t take my continued hesitation as a negative response.
	When I came around the old tree, Sasami seemed to jump a little 
as if she had just been doing something she&#39;d rather not be caught 
doing. I had noticed before that she sometimes went of by herself 
without giving any explanation. It was one of those many mysteries and 
seeing as we all had a basic understanding of these things I usually 
didn&#39;t comment on it.
	Right now I found her reaction somewhat odd though. On first 
glance she seemed to be just sitting there, against the trunk of the 
tree, doing nothing in particular. I wondered what could make her so 
jumpy. Especially since she usually knew when I was around, probably 
more so than I did the other way round.
	&quot;You have been awfully timid the entire evening,&quot; I said and 
then motioned for a spot next to her. &quot;May I?&quot; The observation was 
actually downplaying the matter. Sasami had been more absent and 
introversive the last couple of days. She was trying hard not to show 
it with the others but I had noticed her deep in thought rather often 
and I had the impression she was actually about to tell me a couple of 
times what was on her mind but apparently thought better of it.
	Sasami scooted over, apprehension determining her body language. 
It made me want to find out what was wrong, one way or another. I DID 
care for her. And even if our interaction was usually determined by 
allowing us to set the level of trust individually, I might have to be 
a little more forward here and request an answer. Not that I wanted 
her to feel uncomfortable, but whatever she was dealing with, it 
obviously made her feel just like that.
	&quot;You must have felt it,&quot; Sasami spoke up quietly after awhile of 
silence. I was confused for a few moments, trying to figure out what 
she meant. Then it hit me with sudden clarity. She was obviously 
talking about that strange sense of danger both Kagome and I had felt 
lately and which had been more or less confirmed by Hitomi earlier in 
the day. I had tried meditating on the vision the other girl described 
but the Sacred Fire wouldn&#39;t grant me any insight. I had contacted Ami 
to check on any kind of unusual readings. The result had been rather 
disappointing. Whatever IT was, IT seemed to understand how to 
disguise itself well.
	But why was Sasami so torn up about this? True, I still didn&#39;t 
exactly know the full range of her abilities and then there was that 
mysterious presence that seemed to often mingle with her own, but why 
would she be so secretive about this? The other girl should know by 
now that the rest of us would be aware of the same feeling... Or did 
she know something we didn&#39;t and was wondering how to tell us without 
giving too much of her apparent secrets away? I wasn&#39;t sure where the 
thought had come from. Probably because I came to understand the 
younger girl so well.
	&quot;I shouldn&#39;t be here.&quot; Huh? My head snapped up and around to 
look at Sasami sharply. The other girl looked back somewhat sadly and 
that moment she appeared much older than her age would suggest. It 
wasn&#39;t the first time I noticed that happening which was one of the 
reasons why I never found myself uncomfortable at the apparent age 
gap. &quot;I&#39;m getting you all into danger.&quot;
	&quot;Why?&quot; I asked tentatively, trying to fend off the feeling of 
dread by her first announcement. I had become so dependent on Sasami 
that it made me also just as scared to lose her now as it scared me to 
admit to any kind of deeper feeling. Maybe even more so. It had been 
true, what I told her yesterday. It WAS nice to be worried about by 
someone. I&#39;ve never felt as appreciated as a person than when I was 
around Sasami.
	&quot;I...&quot; she trailed of, looking away.
	This was a turning point. I honestly couldn&#39;t tell you how I 
knew at that moment, but I knew this was a turning point in our 
relationship. A turning point in which direction was still to be 
decided though. And that decision had been made already in my heart. I 
could not bear the thought of losing this opportunity. I had to take 
some steps towards her on my own and I was finally ready to do them. 
Maybe not all the way yet but enough to make her see that I really did 
care a lot.
	I put a gentle hand on her shoulder and urged her to turn 
around. Pinkish-red eyes looked up at me troubled, torn. &quot;Is it so 
hard for you? To trust me with this.&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to apply pressure 
here. As I said, I respected her privacy. On the other hand though I 
had been giving more of myself away when she had about her own past. 
It made me wonder more than once what exactly she was hiding. Sasami 
had said that her father was into politics as well. Was she in some 
kind of trouble, maybe hiding here, and was the danger about her? Her 
comment would make sense that way. I could only speculate.
	Sasami looked down into her lap, averting her gaze from mine. &quot;I 
wondered when you would ask. There are so many things you don&#39;t know 
about me and some of those... Let us just say it is hard to 
understand, even for my family and friends. I want to tell you Rei. I 
really want to.&quot; Then she looked up again and I swallowed at the 
haunted look. &quot;But I am scared. Scared that it will change everything 
again. I keep telling myself that you will understand when you finally 
find out who and what I really am...&quot;
	And I kissed her.
	Didn&#39;t see it coming myself but I still did. Short but deep. 
There was no great fanfare to it. No flashy fireworks or stuff. 
However, the spiritual fulfillment and completeness I felt for a 
single moment was telling me all I still needed to know.
	&quot;Rei-chan...&quot; Sasami touched her lips in evident shock and it 
took me a few moments to recover myself. However, then I realized just 
what had prompted me to do that and an unusual calm - for this kind of 
situations - overcame me.
	&quot;You are the girl who makes me feel better when I have my entire 
life so far, you are the girl who has blessed this place with joy and 
happiness not experienced here before. You are the girl that makes me 
do things I had never thought. But most importantly, you are the girl 
that obviously doesn&#39;t shy away from any kind of reluctance to show me 
how much she loves me. Or is that not true?&quot;
	Sasami stared for a couple of moments, unblinking but not 
looking away. &quot;No,&quot; she finally whispered.
	&quot;Good,&quot; I said firmly. &quot;Because if that is the truth, then all 
those things won&#39;t change regardless of whatever you think I might or 
might not understand. I DO understand what I have seen so far. And 
that,&quot; I continued, taking her hand, &quot;is one of the most wonderful 
creatures I have ever met. I don&#39;t know what it is you think is so 
hard to understand but let me tell you that I have seen quite a bit of 
weirdness myself in my life and so far I&#39;ve coped with all of it. So 
you should have a bit more self-confidence. You bring so much joy to 
the people around you. That should be enough proof that you have an 
enormous positive effect on your surroundings.&quot; I squeezed her hands. 
&quot;So start thinking a bit more positively, alright?&quot;
	Sasami smiled now, faint but genuine. There was a tear running 
down her cheek but she quickly wiped it away. &quot;Arigato, Rei-chan.&quot;

******************************

(Kagome)
Breakfast had been unusually tense. It was like everyone KNEW 
something was going to happen today. What and what size it would be, 
that was uncertain, but that something would happen was practically a 
fact. Also, it would most likely be something unpleasant. The 
atmosphere around the shrine was thick with anxiety, expecting the 
unknown. It was hard enough to go back to doing normal chores. 
However, Rei obviously had had finally enough of it and practically 
ordered us all out to go about the daily routine.
	She was clearly reluctant to do her own though. Or to leave 
Sasami&#39;s side for that matter. Since getting up those two had been 
close to inseparable. They were holding hands under the table for the 
kami&#39;s sake! Come to think of it they had been like that since late 
yesterday evening. After lunch Rei had followed our youngest member 
out into the yard, obviously to spend some time together... Something 
far more significant had to have happened.
	I was still rather on edge. I could not claim that I was a 
fighter but now with Kikyou&#39;s memories I saw myself closest to the 
miko and priestess duties of helping those in need and defending them 
from evil. I had promised to do whatever was necessary to keep this, 
our new friends, from being destroyed once again. One time had clearly 
been enough, I could not stand another. And neither could Sango.
	And so I was carrying around arrows and a bow, not really 
bothering right now what possible visitors would think. Sango had 
placed Hiraikotsu somewhere where she could reach it easily and fast. 
Should something happen where we were required to fight, then we would 
do so. I touched the gem hidden under my robes carefully. And whoever 
would dare to try and disturb our newfound home, they would soon learn 
that we had not defeated Naraku with mere luck alone.
	I spotted Sasami pretty much absentmindedly sweeping the yard. I 
had been able to observe this often enough. She often would do 
something like this when she seemed lost in thought. Not really paying 
attention to where she was sweeping and often enough working on one 
spot for minutes. Those instances had become considerably less lately, 
especially after the hot springs trip, but in the last few days had 
picked up again.
	I had some idea what was going on actually. The younger girl 
hadn&#39;t shared the full story with me. Actually she had only requested 
for me not to tell anyone yet. I was entirely sure what I was supposed 
to tell anyway. All I DID know was that during the battle with the 
Youkai ghost I had seen her utilize the powers of an elemental being 
herself. Unlike what I had read about ancient human-elemental 
contracts this one seemed to be much deeper. Physical as well as 
spiritual. I could draw my conclusions, of course, but they would stay 
mere speculation until Sasami confirmed them.
	And in the end it didn&#39;t really matter. Dryad - even if it was 
really a Yggdrasil dryad - or not, all that I needed to know was that 
this detail wasn&#39;t in the least bit dangerous. In fact it should 
eliminate any kind of danger potential. While Kikyou had only met a 
few elementals in her life - rather fleetingly at that - I doubted 
there was something like an evil dryad - at least not an evil dryad of 
a Life Tree...
	I was very shortly to be proven otherwise and only later would 
fully realize the irony of that line of thought.
	As it was I walked over to the blue-haired girl and gently 
nudged her with an elbow. Pinkish eyes blinked confused for a moment 
and then, almost predictably - her cheeks colored slightly when she 
realized she hadn&#39;t been paying attention to her work. &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
about it,&quot; I waved the point aside. &quot;We are all a bit on edge right 
now.&quot; I wondered just how much that looming feeling of danger was 
connected to the other girl or at least how much she knew about it.
	Especially in light of what Rei had told us before we all went 
to our daily chores. She had specifically warned us that something 
unidentified was approaching and that we should all be on our guard. 
Neither Sango nor I had missed the looks exchanged between oldest and 
youngest miko and I could not shake of the feeling that this 
information was not out of a fire reading or something else that Rei 
had picked up. Not that I doubted her senses but in spiritual skill we 
were close enough and I had still not a clue at all just what the 
ominous feeling that I had had for a few days now meant. Sasami on the 
other hand was still a rather unknown factor in terms of the full 
scope of her skills. And taking in account what I had learnt about her 
recently...
	Right now the younger girl seemed rather uncomfortable as if she 
knew much more about what was going on. I was about to say something 
to cheer her up when I became witness of a rather strange occurrence. 
Sasami seemed to literally freeze in mid motion. Her eyes were open 
but unfocused. My guess was that she might be in deeper conversation 
with her elemental, so I wasn&#39;t immediately worried. Merely curious. 
When two small signs in the shape of inverted triangles appeared on 
her forehead though and flashed first a strong blue but quickly 
turning into a dark yellow I was becoming concerned. I became frantic 
when Sasami suddenly dropped to her knees, her mouth open as if to cry 
out, but it was a soundless one.
	&quot;Sasami!&quot; I shouted worried, catching her before she could hit 
the ground. I extended my senses towards her, trying to determine what 
was wrong. At first I couldn&#39;t find anything but then I registered a 
sudden drop in life energy and with a dark suspicion turned my 
attention towards where I believed her connection to the elemental 
was. With a gasp I tore away when I was met by angry yellow flames 
burning at the base of what bond human and spiritual creature 
together.
	I heard Rei and Sango before they even arrived, my shout must 
have reached them. Not too surprising Rei was on Sasami&#39;s other side 
in a flash, similarly as to the incident a few months ago. This time 
though the reaction was much more legitimate. &quot;What happened?&quot; Rei 
asked grimly and I had to wonder from where she took the sudden 
control considering her usual reactions when it concerned Sasami. 
However, it was a very thin control that much I could tell.
	&quot;Some kind of spiritual attack I think,&quot; I related my 
observations and caught Rei&#39;s hand when I saw her attempting the same 
that I did. &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; I hissed sharply.
	Rei was ready to retaliate but at that moment Sango, who had 
taken a wary, defensive position, cut in, &quot;We are not alone.&quot;
	With effort Rei tore her gaze away from Sasami and looked 
around. I did the same. However, our search obviously met with the 
same result. Not completely negative. Someone or something was 
definitely here, at the Jinja, VERY close by. I could sense a faint 
aura resonation but it was distorted and impossible to pinpoint. 
However, actually seeing whatever was there - which was probably 
responsible for Sasami&#39;s current condition - that was something 
neither of us obviously could.
	Taking into account our individual skill levels that was quite 
frightening.
	Rei shifted next to me and I saw her hand disappearing in her 
robe for a moment. Her muscles were tense and her face grim, eyes 
darting back and forth between scanning the yard and with rising 
concern watching the younger girl between us. Sango had Hiraikotsu 
already in one hand. It was eerie. Frighteningly eerie. The tension 
was at its breaking point, any time something could happen now... and 
we had NO idea what, when and ESPECIALLY where.
	So when the strike came, none of us were prepared and we might 
as well have completely missed it until to later if not something 
unexpected had happened. Or more like several somethings.

******************************

(Hitomi)
I was never quite certain why I had had the impulse of taking the 
pendant back with me at the end of my last visit to Gaea. Van hadn&#39;t 
asked about it, trusting my judgment - or more like instinct - on this 
but today I was honestly glad that I had followed these instincts. I 
wasn&#39;t sure just how far I could influence things around me or if it 
was really FATE that was influenced. I didn&#39;t really believe fate was 
predetermined, that is what I had told Dornkirk. Sure, there were 
obviously things that were fixed in the great shape of things. That I 
tended to rather call destiny. The greater picture. Fate for me was 
what determined our individual lives. And what good was free will and 
all that if your life&#39;s story was already completely written for you?
	Not very much. And that is why I was a bit wary of my own powers 
these days. I couldn&#39;t quite believe that I was able to influence 
other people&#39;s fate as the spirit of Van&#39;s mother had told me back at 
the valley. Maybe that was one of the reasons behind the motivation of 
learning more of the ancient myth of Atlantis and everything that was 
connected to it. I needed to know just exactly what I was able to do 
so I wouldn&#39;t be drawn once more into a conflict like on Gaea, 
involuntarily causing things to happen that I didn&#39;t want to. I needed 
to know my connection to this ancient, powerful empire of legend 
because I suspected my abilities might have their origin there.
	The pendant was just a focus. It made concentrating easier but 
it wasn&#39;t the source of my visions and other skills. I had found that 
out quickly enough after I returned to Earth without it for the first 
time. Right now I was still rather glad that I had it with me. The 
vision yesterday had left an impression. The images had been rather 
vague, more like seeing events through a mist. That rarely happened. 
In fact what I saw of past and future was usually rather detailed. 
Also, the pendant was practically pulling me towards Hikawa Jinja as I 
made my way over to Azabu-Juuban this morning. It wasn&#39;t like I was 
required to come over right away, just sometimes over the day to 
discuss last details. But an undeniable sense of urgency was leading 
me. Just a good thing that today the teachers on my High School were 
on some kind of excursion and I didn&#39;t need to attend. I probably 
wouldn&#39;t have been able to pay much attention.
	My subconscious worry was quickly confirmed when I reached the 
steps that let up to the shrine. There was a barrier here. And a 
strong one at that. It wasn&#39;t anything technological. More a magical 
or better spiritual thing. The feeling of urgency immediately tripled. 
I had been right, something was going to happen here. My vision 
blurred momentarily and I could see the faint outlines of an event. An 
older woman about to strike at a familiar young figure. The 
blue-haired one, what was her name, Sasami. And there was a vague 
apparition in the background, like an all powerful goddess.
	I snapped my eyes open and hastily stepped forward, not even 
bothered by the barrier as my ability to see the invisible immediately 
found a weak point that could be exploited. Hurriedly I ran up the 
stairs, hoping that I could prevent what I had seen. No, I had to 
believe that I could. If what Van&#39;s mother had said was true, then I 
needed to keep a positive outlook or else my fears and anxiety would 
become reality.
	I arrived in the yard, taking in the scene quickly. The young 
girl was on the ground - only unconscious I hoped - two of the other 
girls were kneeling next to her but all looked around guardedly as if 
expecting an attack at any moment now.
	That was when I saw the other person who definitely didn&#39;t 
belong here and at once realized that I was the only one who actually 
could see her. The woman with her dark blue hair tied into two curly 
buns up front and a short thicker one in the back was wearing glasses 
and a kind of armor. But I didn&#39;t pay that much attention since she 
was about to strike at the unaware group in some manner. She had her 
hand outstretched and some kind of dark yellow energy was gathering 
around it.
	I had to do something fast. &quot;She&#39;s behind you!&quot; I called out, 
pointing at the point where the unfamiliar woman was preparing her 
assault. It took only a little while for the three conscious girls to 
look over in surprise at my appearance and then divert their attention 
to where I indicated the threat was. Unfortunately that short moment 
of surprise was enough and with doubtless clarity I realized they 
wouldn&#39;t be able to react fast enough as the woman&#39;s face contorted 
into a snarl and her eyes narrowed. Any moment now she would...
	Be slammed a couple of feet backwards by a blur of yellow and 
green. So much for predetermined fate. I definitely hadn&#39;t seen the 
young girl in a kimono-like garb with green hair tied into a single 
ponytail now holding the surprised and irritated woman at bay with two 
glowing blue-white blades of light.

******************************

(Rei)
I wasn&#39;t getting through to the others. Something was blocking the 
signal out. I was no technological expert but reckoned that whoever 
was behind that obviously was taking no chances with any possible 
outside interference. We were on our own now, with a threat that we 
knew was there but that we couldn&#39;t see properly. There was a person&#39;s 
aura here but I couldn&#39;t pinpoint it properly.
	One of the main reasons probably was the greater distraction 
provided by Sasami&#39;s current state. She was not showing any signs of 
waking up. In fact, I could feel her life force dropping more and 
more. It concerned me. Scratch that. It brought me close the edge of 
insanity. Yesterday night was still fresh in my head. The kiss that 
wasn&#39;t even really planned but that I still didn&#39;t regret and the 
assurance I had given the younger girl which HAD come straight from 
the heart... And then there was the things that I hadn&#39;t said but 
maybe should have. Maybe it was too late now and Kagome had been right 
and maybe...
	&#39;Snap out of it!&#39; I clamped down on my inner turmoil with a 
figurative iron fist. That was one of the other reasons why I had 
never allowed myself to fall in love before. It could become horribly 
distracting and was nearly destroying all my training and inner focus 
in a single heartbeat. I had always had a nagging fear that I couldn&#39;t 
balance it properly should I ever find myself in such a situation.
	However, I realized that over the last months - and the last 
years too - I had changed somewhat. Subtle at first, barely 
noticeable. I began to see that the things I had believed in because 
of my not so ideal childhood were not always true. And then had come 
Sasami and she had made all the difference. Somehow she managed to get 
under all my defenses and make them completely useless. I had learned 
to trust, both someone else and also myself.
	And I would not let this new chance, this glimmer of hope that 
had been hidden in my heart for long years, slip away again. I wasn&#39;t 
sure if I could bear it.
	There was a slight steer and without checking I could tell that 
Sasami was somehow fighting back against whatever was assaulting her 
spirit. Grudgingly I had to concede that this was one battle she had 
to fight herself and all I could do was place my trust in her for her 
success. I was certain she could do it. Despite not knowing much about 
the true extent of her abilities or exact details about them, I knew 
that she was powerful enough. I had to and did BELIEVE in her.
	So, as now to focus on the other problem. I had one hand 
practically in subspace already, more than figuratively grasping my 
Sailor Crystal. I couldn&#39;t care less for witnesses right now. I would 
protect Sasami, and the others, at all costs. When the shout came I 
took a moment to locate its owner. But even as I registered that it 
was Hitomi, I realized that I had made a tactical mistake that Minako 
would have scolded me for, letting me hear about it for days.
	Fortunately without consequence.
	I blinked, seeing the new arrival slam into the older woman, 
whatever had been concealing her was obviously failing as twin glowing 
blades cut into the black armor... Or at least that was probably what 
was supposed to happen. The slices seemed to yield not much effect 
other than driving our assailant back a few feet. Obviously realizing 
this the other girl, much younger - physically she actually seemed 
around Sasami&#39;s age - disengaged and in a hypnotizing display of grace 
flipped backwards to land in front of the four of us.

******************************

(Mizuki)
I had barely made it in time. Aquila had calculated a subspace route 
that was as fast as it was outstandingly dangerous. However, that was 
what she had been made for. And while I could not understand Mother&#39;s 
sudden change, I had to admit that she had done a good job. No make 
that an excellent job. While following this route I had pondered the 
development. I was quite certain that Kusumi was not quite herself. We 
had had a few long talks after that disaster on Earth - and after I 
vented my anger for discarding me so easily - and my mother/creator 
had seemed to sincerely regret her actions. Even if I had to visibly 
restrain her from charging back to settle her score with Washu once 
she discovered that computer virus in her system...
	No, Kusumi had changed. I should know. We had spent the last 
years almost constantly together, working on various projects. This 
sudden behavior change was irrational. True enough, Mother had always 
been eccentric but that was going over the top. She would certainly 
not lock me up without any warning. Not after the time we had spent 
together recently.
	So, that left the question who would... or better who COULD make 
her act this way. I had not come to any answers on that subject and in 
the end resolved that catching up to her and averting whatever she 
planned was the primary objective right now. Everything else could 
wait for later.
	Arriving on Earth, I had spotted Mother&#39;s ship in the 
atmosphere, doing combat with a Juraian ship as it seemed. And if my 
quick identity scan was correct, it was not just some random ship. But 
rather the origin of all tree ships - the Ouke no Ki. For a moment I 
had thought that obviously I needn&#39;t have made haste since things 
appeared under control. That was when Aquila pointed out that my 
mother&#39;s ship was flying on autopilot and that its owner&#39;s life signal 
actually came from Earth&#39;s surface.
	A diversion.
	I had been quick to follow the location my ship&#39;s AI had 
indicated and upon arriving at the Japanese shrine had discovered to 
my dismay that some kind of force field had been erected just short of 
my arrival. Blocking out all kinds of transmissions as well as other 
life forms. Taking a chance I had tried to phase in. At first, I had 
met the expected resistance but then there was some strange energy 
disruption. I had not paid it much attention other than exploiting 
that opportunity. And even then had I barely been in time.
	Now I stood in the middle of the shrine, with my plasma blades 
at the ready. The resistance I had encountered in my mother&#39;s suit was 
strong, stronger than I believed possible with her usual technological 
inventions. The repelling factor hinted at some sort of additional 
barrier.
	&quot;Mizuki,&quot; my mother snarled, &quot;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d get here in 
time.&quot; Obviously she had not expected Aquila to be THAT fast. Serves 
her right. I had inherited a lot of her knowledge and skill when I was 
created and was almost as apt as a scientist as she was, and while my 
mother had helped constructing my new ship, most of the work was my 
own.
	&quot;Mother,&quot; I shot back through clenched teeth, no doubt drawing 
surprise from the group behind me from which I only recognized the 
young princess. But the rest obviously cared for her and were quite 
evidently angry at the sneak attack. &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; 
The other girl, the one who had shouted the warning - and I really 
wondered how she had seen through the cloak -, had come up to stand 
behind the others a bit uncertain. My main concern was directed at 
Kusumi, though.
	I was furious. &quot;Why are you attacking them? Didn&#39;t you promise 
not to do these things anymore?&quot; Was all that we had talked about just 
a ruse? Didn&#39;t she change at all? The last two years I had really 
thought we could be a family. The malice and hatred Mother carried 
around - mostly for Washu - seemed drained. Why was she doing this?
	&quot;It is of no concern to you,&quot; my mother replied and by all means 
she sounded much to even, with much less emotion. Usually an 
interference like this would bring about a bout of anger and ranting. 
Now she seemed rather cool and collected. More like a robot than a 
human being. No, the woman I had began to actually respect as my 
creator over the last years. This was more like a puppet with someone 
else pulling the strings. &quot;Step out of the way, na&iuml;ve little girl. I 
have a mission to fulfill. And then I succeed my talents will finally 
be properly acknowledged.&quot;
	Before I could say anything in return, I saw movement behind me. 
One of the raven-haired shrine girls who had knelt next to Princess 
Sasami was now standing and looking none too peaceful. She reminded me 
at once somewhat of Jurai&#39;s first princess - now Empress - with the 
temper matching perfectly. And since I still had no idea about the 
younger princess&#39; condition, it was all too understandable. In fact I 
wondered what had happened since I was certain to have intercepted 
Kusumi before she could do any permanent harm.
	&quot;Not to interrupt an obvious heartfelt family reunion,&quot; the 
young woman, the oldest of the group if I judged correctly, said with 
obvious sarcasm and barely restrained fury, &quot;but you think you can 
just come in here, hurt one of my friends and get away with that?&quot;
	Mother chuckled. &quot;I don&#39;t see the what you would be able to do 
about it. I bet she hasn&#39;t even told you about being a princess of the 
most powerful empire this galaxy has seen for many millennia.&quot; I 
winced. Realizing that the possibility was indeed high that the young 
princess was here incognito. The reason was unclear but now that I 
thought about it, Jurai as a whole had been in quite an uproar. Exact 
information was obviously withheld but it was most likely that 
Princess Sasami being here had something to do with it. And I doubted 
that if her friends did not know about her identity yet, this was a 
rather tactless way of revealing it to them.
	The reply from the young woman that had addressed my mother 
surprised me though. &quot;So, what if she is?&quot; The casual counter 
surprised Kusumi as well. For a moment her cold demeanor changed to an 
incredulous and perplexed expression. &quot;It doesn&#39;t change anything 
about who she is and what she means to us.&quot;
	&quot;Hmph,&quot; my mother snorted derisively. &quot;Not that it matters what 
you think. Now stand aside or I will just have to kill you all.&quot;
	I lifted my energy blades in a defensive posture, trying one 
last time to get through to her. &quot;Mother, stop that nonsense at once. 
If not... Well, I already showed you before that you tend to 
underestimate...&quot;
	Before I could end the sentence the older woman lifted her hand 
and a blast of yellow energy shot forward. I was able to block it by 
crossing my two blades in front of myself but the sheer force behind 
it took me completely off guard. &#39;That wasn&#39;t a simple energy beam,&#39; I 
thought while rocketing backwards, hard.

******************************

(Sango)
I could hardly believe my eyes and obviously neither did the rest of 
our group. The force behind that blast might as well have been lethal 
and only the younger girl&#39;s own weapons had prevented it from meeting 
that effect and obvious intent. Didn&#39;t she call the other woman 
&quot;mother&quot;? If that was true, how could she then so easily attack her 
own daughter, not caring whether or not it killed her in the process?
	Memories flashed before my mental eye. This was very familiar, 
too familiar for my liking. So much like the time when Naraku used my 
little brother to kill his own father and fellow exterminators - 
myself included even if I survived in the end. After that experience 
one thing had been burned into my memory. Kohaku&#39;s face when he 
realized what he had been doing. The sheer horror at having committed 
such a slaughter.
	And then, of course, there was the eventual conclusion, despite 
all my progress still so painful to remember. When I, myself, had been 
forced to make that awful choice. That had been the most traumatic to 
deal with. Not the tortures before but that moment where I had to end 
the life of my own brother in order to save Kagome...
	Was it possible that the older woman was similarly made to do 
this? I could not believe that anyone could raise a finger against 
their own blood with the intent to harm or even kill. That was 
something that I could not integrate into my mindset albeit I did know 
that it happened often enough. However, from Mizuki&#39;s words, I 
believed that she didn&#39;t anticipate this sort of behavior and just as 
much refused to believe that her mother was doing this out of free 
will.
	Unfortunately, that was of little concern right now. Sasami was 
unconscious or worse. Rei was on the edge of snapping - I could tell 
having gone through similar episodes often enough - and our adversary 
posed a not to be underestimated threat. Manipulated or not, she had 
to be dealt with. If alone for young Sasami&#39;s sake. I owed the girl so 
much already. The idea of her coming to any harm made me furious 
enough to rush in right away and strike at the enemy if not for my 
battle training kicking in and reminding me of the folly of such an 
action.
	&quot;Now, who said I underestimated you, daughter? I made you, so I 
should know your limits better than anyone else,&quot; the older woman 
commented, only sparing the groaning form of the younger girl a 
passing glance. The blast had knocked the pinkish ribbon that tied her 
light green hair into a ponytail across the yard and her hair was now 
in quite a bit of disarray. &quot;Now. Surrender Princess Sasami to me if 
you don&#39;t want to meet the same fate.&quot;
	I scowled in dismay and really wished Kirara was here - she had 
gone out for a stroll in the neighborhood this morning and had not 
been back yet which worried me just as much. But Rei was acting 
faster. &quot;No,&quot; was all she said in a dark voice that broke no argument. 
In one fluid motion she had an ofuda in her hand and was chanting 
under her breath. Normally, I would think this to be quite useless but 
maybe she had the same idea that the older woman was manipulated, 
maybe some form of possession. And I had hardly ever seen anyone able 
to channel so much spiritual energy into a simple ofuda. Miroku had 
been rather good but Rei&#39;s ability was even much more potent. And 
right now her powers were fueled by an intense and righteous anger and 
concern for Sasami&#39;s safety.
	Our foe was obviously a little surprised by the vehement 
refusal, having not expected that much resistance from a bunch of - in 
her opinion - obvious &quot;little girls&quot;. Without further words or 
ceremony Rei launched her charged ofuda at the woman who watched it 
approach curiously and not very concerned. It turned out she had any 
right to be this idle since the prayer strip made contact with what 
was obviously some kind of barrier that flickered into existence for a 
bare moment. &quot;Was that supposed to do something?&quot;
	Maybe not that, I thought grimly. I had circled around the woman 
and instinctively followed our nominal leader&#39;s initiative. As soon as 
she had thrown the ofuda I was in the air, Hiraikotsu ready for a 
swing that would take our foe down quickly. Seeing the barrier I 
probably should have stopped my attack but on top of being in mid air, 
my instinct was telling me that the spiritual attack could have 
weakened the barrier. Gathering my strength I slammed Hiraikotsu 
downwards...
	The woman seemed to sense my attack at the last moment. Whirling 
around with a perplexed look on her face, she brought up her arm in a 
vain attempt to deflect the strike. It was, however, my turn to watch 
in surprised dismay when my trusted weapon that could easily cut up a 
normal Youkai met the armor of the woman and was rebounding on it. 
Distracted by this development, I had no time to react properly when 
my foe brought up her other hand. Reflexes took over and I twisted my 
body to the side.
	Pain exploded all over my body as I was flung backwards, 
striking the pavement HARD. Again instincts took over and I allowed 
myself to turn my fall into a clumsy roll that prevented further 
injury upon impact but I had to fight the impulse of submitting to 
unconsciousness. In the end I could be glad to not have taken the 
attack up front or I might have not been so lucky. As it was the beam 
had only caught me in the side. Not that that wasn&#39;t enough. I had, 
however, endured FAR worse back in my own time and had built up what 
others would call amazing stamina and so it only took a handful of 
moments to regain awareness of myself and my surroundings again.
	I caught the end result of one of Kagome&#39;s arrows striking the 
barrier full force. My lover was clearly upset, which was to be 
expected. Unfortunately her shot had little to no effect in even 
temporally breaking the shield. &quot;I admit that was unexpected. You had 
your chance though. Now I won&#39;t take you so lightly anymore.&quot; She 
raised her hands towards the rest of the group, intent evident. Fear 
for my lover and friends prompted me to strain against the impulse of 
resting my battered body a little longer. I had sworn not to let 
anything happen to either of them, not again.
	Once more I was in for a surprise when Rei took a stance between 
Sasami, Kagome, Hitomi and the recovering Mizuki and our foe. &quot;That is 
enough. I don&#39;t know who you are or what you want with Sasami and 
frankly I don&#39;t care. No one hurts my friends and lives not regretting 
it. You picked your fight with the wrong sort of people.&quot; With that 
she thrust her right arm into the air, holding a red glowing object in 
her hand. &quot;MARS CRYSTAL POWER!&quot;
	Fiery red energy washed over Rei&#39;s body reforming into a uniform 
resembling what Japanese school girls tended to wear. With a short red 
skirt and white top with a purple ribbon in the center. Her head was 
adorned with a tiara, a red gem in the middle. Now, I HAD read once or 
twice about the urban legend of the so-called Sailorsenshi that been 
active just a few years before I came to this era but I had not seen 
any pictures and couldn&#39;t draw the connection right away.
	I couldn&#39;t see the other woman&#39;s reaction being behind her but 
the rest of my friends were definitely surprised. &#39;It doesn&#39;t really 
matter now,&#39; I told myself. The battle was not over yet. Questions and 
explanations could be made later. And I certainly had seen enough what 
the people of this time - and many of my own - would consider 
supernatural. I could take this revelation in stride. And besides... 
If the rumors and stories I have heard were true, we might as well 
have gained a definite edge in this battle.
	&quot;Now,&quot; Rei, or whatever she called herself now, stated in a 
deathly calm voice, &quot;try this for starters.&quot; With that she put her 
hands and fingers together in a traditional prayer pose, a fireball 
shaping on the tips of her fingers. &quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;
	As I forced myself into motion once more, I thought to myself 
that this was getting weirder and weirder. Nonetheless, I had a 
promise to uphold and I would not, could not fail this one.

******************************

(Sasami)
The landscape around me was rather distorted and I still felt rather 
fuzzy, so that didn&#39;t help either. What happened anyway? My memories 
of recent events only started to return with annoying slowness. I knew 
that something major had happened. I was outside when Kagome joined 
me. But before we managed to strike up a real conversation, Tsunami 
had called me that she was currently battling an unidentified ship. 
She had been worried, believing something was odd about it since the 
ship was making no real effort to get past her - not that that should 
be possible by anything short of a second Soja - and then...
	Then the connection had been broken. No, not just broken. I had 
felt like a flame was burning away at all attachments I had to 
Tsunami, tearing away at our spirits with a merciless vehemence. I 
tried reaching out to my eternal companion but as feared there was 
nothing. Not even a faint echo. This was not like when she left before 
to do things on her she didn&#39;t want me to know about - like when she 
first went to see Martel. That constant presence that I had become 
accustomed to for years since the incident on Jurai was completely 
gone. And it made me feel horribly empty, lost and powerless. For a 
moment I feared that something might have happened to my other half 
but that was impossible. If anything, I should be the one who would 
rather prove to be the weaker link. Tsunami could survive on her own. 
She had before I came into the picture and I was sure she still could 
if I was to die.
	But then what happened? I wasn&#39;t dead. Not completely. I could 
tell that by instinct. The surroundings were kind of familiar. I 
focused on the swirling colors and mostly non-physical surroundings. 
Of course, I was on the Astral Plane. On an enclosed space of the 
Astral Plane that prevented me from going anywhere. It was a trap.
	&quot;So, you do possess some skill after all. Hardly surprising 
since Tsunami would surely not want her host ignorant.&quot; I whirled 
around at the voice and watched a shadowy figure take shape. The 
apparition was taking up a huge amount of space. It was a woman with 
grayish hair and four red strands that came out of a yellow gem on her 
forehead. She had cold and passive features, barely any extreme 
emotion betraying her face. &quot;Welcome, Princess Sasami. Avatar and 
appointed host to my dear sister.&quot;
	I recognized the woman instantly. I had never met her in person 
but Tsunami&#39;s memory about her elemental sibling were so strong and 
dominant that it was hard to not pick them up. &quot;Tokimi,&quot; I whispered 
in apprehension bordering on actual fear. It all made sense to me now. 
Tokimi had to have that planned, separating Tsunami and I somehow. And 
without Tsunami&#39;s aid I stood no chance against her. &quot;What... what do 
you want?&quot; I demanded timidly, &quot;What did you do to us?&quot;
	&quot;I have come to stop you from interfering further. It would 
serve no purpose to tell you my motivations since you will be removed 
in the next moments anyway,&quot; Tokimi answered, never changing her 
expression, totally confident of her success. I took a step back 
reflexively, staring up at the giant form of the elemental Tokimi 
chose to project herself as. I knew that she had the power to go along 
with her threat. No, for her it was more a statement. We had not heard 
anything from Tsunami&#39;s sibling in years now but it appeared that she 
had caught us both totally off guard. And there was nothing I could do 
now. Not without Tsunami. I was alone and the absence of my long-time 
companion drained my fighting spirit.
	&quot;Exactly. You have always been the weakest of those Tsunami 
chose to assimilate with. Her original self and even that human who 
bore her name. They were powerful. But you? All you are good for is to 
provide a physical body and I cannot allow my sister this ability. 
That is why you have to be removed. And since you are also so closely 
linked by now, your loss will considerably weaken her.&quot; So that was it 
then. I was a liability after all. While Tsunami might get the ability 
to take physical shape through me, I was also providing her with a 
weakness as long as we were not fully assimilated. Tokimi&#39;s words cut 
right into my own already weakened spirit and on this plane my spirit 
was the dominant form after all.
	&#39;You should have a bit more self-confidence. You bring so much 
joy to the people around you. That should be enough proof that you 
have an enormous positive effect on your surroundings. So start 
thinking a bit more positively, alright?&#39;
	Rei&#39;s words from the previous evenings sprang into my mind, 
combined with an image of the fair raven-haired beauty who had taken 
me in and given me a new home, a new family... a new love, my real 
love. And there was still something I needed to do. I needed to 
receive her answer. I needed her to tell me that she returned my 
feelings because... Because I should not doubt that she would. All 
signs were pointing in that direction and she herself had told me to 
be more confident about myself.
	But what could I possibly do? Without Tsunami I was only the 
unimportant second princess of Jurai, only another... Only another 
member of the Royal Family! Of course. Most nobles who were bonded to 
a Ouke no Ki received their powers from the connection to their 
partners but some, especially those of pure royal blood possessed 
already their own inherited spiritual abilities. The trees were mostly 
there to provide a greater supply of energy to the human partner.
	&quot;You are scared of me,&quot; I stated with a smile slowly forming on 
my face as I looked up to Tokimi defiantly. The woman actually showed 
a fair amount of surprise at the reaction. &quot;I get it now. You ARE 
scared of. You know that when Tsunami and her namesake assimilated 
they became too powerful for you to confront directly. That is why you 
never made a direct attack against us. And now you fear that when our 
assimilation is complete you would never succeed in your plans.&quot;
	The passive, expressionless fa&ccedil;ade cracked for a moment, hints 
of a snarl showing on Tokimi&#39;s face. &quot;What could you possibly do 
without Tsunami? Without her, you would not even be alive at this 
point. And even if you were right and I DID fear you, you cannot 
escape here.&quot;
	I stood a bit taller now, squaring my shoulders as I faced off 
with one of the most powerful creatures in the galaxy, drawing on 
Rei&#39;s supportive words and the strength that suddenly flowed through 
me when I thought about her. &quot;You will not hold me,&quot; I stated firmly, 
spiritual energies gathering around me as I drew on my own, inherited 
abilities, the powers that marked me as a descendant of the royal line 
of Jurai. &quot;I am Princess Sasami of Jurai. Chosen partner of Tsunami, 
one of three most powerful Yggdrasil the galaxy knows. I refuse to bow 
down to you, Tokimi.&quot; I could feel it now. The bare, potent energies. 
I realized now how much I had neglected that part of myself. Since 
becoming bonded to Tsunami and understanding her better, I had relied 
on her more and more. Her knowledge, her power. But I had skills and 
powers of my own and while they were untrained, I knew instinctively 
how to use them to escape this prison.
	The relationship between Tsunami and me was a symbiotic one. And 
my part was not just to merely provide the body. It was much more. And 
that was what Tokimi actually did fear.
	Sending one last look of defiance at the woman who now showed 
unconcealed disbelief at the bright spiritual energy surrounding me, I 
released the gathered power, applying my own skill with the knowledge 
I had gained from Tsunami to deal with such situations and fueled by 
the newfound confidence instilled by Rei. The resulting flare was too 
bright to look at but I was certain that I had succeeded.

******************************

(Mars)
This thing was ridiculously resistant. I might have had better chances 
taking on Metallia one by one than this. Currently I was running 
around in a circle, bombarding the enemy with rows of Burning Mandala 
that all impacted upon that strange barrier that seemed to practically 
sniff out any energy making contact with it. Physical attacks were no 
good either since they were rebounding and the resulting psychic shock 
was not one to be recommended. I had tried it once and since then 
rather relied on long-range attacks. Not that they met with better 
results.
	I really wished that the others were here. As strong as this 
barrier was, nothing could stand long before our combined power. Also, 
the aid I did have here was not exactly what you could call a team. I 
had only known Sango for a few months and while she proved to be an 
exceptional fighter, her skills were mostly close-combat and 
weapon-related, making her much less effective in this situation. The 
new arrival, the girl named Mizuki, at least had energy beams to offer 
that added to my own attacks. But they were just as useless as my 
fire.
	I just couldn&#39;t hazard what was powering that barrier. There had 
to be some kind of weakness.
	Sango dove out of the way of another beam from the woman who 
stood behind her force field with not much concern... which was rather 
justified in my opinion. Realizing that our opponent readjusted her 
aim to follow the evasion, I quickly aimed and sent another clumsy 
Fire Soul in front of her vision so that she was momentarily blinded.
	Sango used the opportunity to join me, clearly winded, not to 
mention what trouble the wound to her side was still giving her. I was 
amazed that she was still standing. &quot;You&#39;ve seen it too, didn&#39;t you?&quot; 
I asked, referring to our opponent&#39;s tactics. True, one less versed in 
combat would only see our foe standing there taking shots from the 
safety of her shield. However, I had spent far too much time as a 
Senshi and we had come from fledgling soldiers to veterans over the 
years.
	Sango nodded. &quot;She is moving much too sloppy. If the barrier was 
not there, she&#39;d be no problem.&quot; That had been something I had become 
aware of in the first few moments. The offending woman was moving much 
too slow to meet attacks, more calculating than instinctive.
	&quot;Mother isn&#39;t a fighter,&quot; Mizuki startled us for a moment, 
materializing at our side. &quot;She is a scientist and that is how she 
would view a fight.&quot; Her face was grim and she was clearly upset about 
the older woman. &quot;What I don&#39;t understand though is how she can 
generate a spiritual shield of such strength. Mother&#39;s abilities 
are... average at best. She rather relies on her inventions and other 
gadgets.&quot;
	That was somewhere along my thinking. It made a lot of sense 
actually. The woman did not strike me as very intimidating and while I 
knew appearance could be deceiving, there was definitely something 
more behind this. Something neither of us could perceive and the only 
one who might have a clue...
	I glanced behind me to see Sasami still unconscious. However, 
there was a noticeable difference now. Her life force, barely existing 
before, was returning. Not just returning... &quot;What the...?&quot; My battle 
companions turned just in time to brace themselves as a sudden 
eruption of spiritual energy made everyone sensitive enough jump from 
the sheer intensity. It also made my heart jump in joy and relief to 
see consciousness returning to the blue-haired girl - princess.
	If the woman I learned by now was named Kusumi thought she could 
impress us with her revelation, she obviously didn&#39;t know who she was 
dealing with and right now all I was glad about was to see Sasami 
still among the living. And that should give me even more motivation 
to win this battle. For her and for my new friends who had come to 
mean so much to me.

******************************

(Hitomi)
I wonder if I had a nick for stumbling into situations where I 
appeared to be well over my head. By all positive thinking I was 
trying to do, chaos and fighting seemed to follow me ever since that 
fateful day that I first went to Gaea. Now all I was trying to do was 
to accept a part-time job at a local Jinja and earn some extra money, 
maybe making some new friends on the way. And here I was, once again 
in the middle of a mighty struggle. Well, alright. It was more a 
one-sided struggle. The one side struggling, the other just shrugging 
it off with ease.
	I was by no means a fighter. In fact I could barely stand all 
the chaos and destruction battles and wars were creating. I thought I 
left it all behind with the defeat of Zaibach but it seemed that 
Dornkirk&#39;s observation that war was a part of human fate had at least 
some merit. A sad realization indeed.
	&quot;Her life force is rising!&quot; the dark-haired girl - Kagome - next 
to me exclaimed. I was by no means as spiritually skilled as her but 
indeed it seemed that the younger girl in our midst was settling down, 
her breathing evening out. The spasms that had been shaking her body 
earlier were gone and an almost eerie calm seemed to have overcome 
her. Suddenly there was a spark of energy that even I felt, especially 
being in such close proximity and it made me jump a little.
	Sure enough a moment later the young girl - Sasami - was 
blinking her eyes blurrily, trying to focus on her surroundings. &quot;Are 
you alright?&quot; Kagome asked worriedly, for the moment ignoring the 
still ongoing fight. &quot;You gave us quite a scare there.&quot; I was certain 
the others would have liked to express their own concerns but at the 
moment they were hard-pressed to stay alive. The older woman was not 
giving them much time to breathe.
	&quot;I guess so,&quot; Sasami groaned groggily, sitting up a bit more 
steadily with Kagome&#39;s help. Then her voice turned to one of surprise, 
&quot;Kusumi-san, Mizuki-san?&quot; she blinked at the battle waged only a few 
meters away. It occurred to me that it might be a good idea to get a 
bit more distance between us, now that the blue-haired girl was more 
or less alright.
	&quot;You know them?&quot; I asked, gesturing in the direction of the 
combatants.
	Sasami obviously needed a moment to recognize me - not 
surprising - but eventually nodded.
	I had focused on the green-haired girl, sneaking up behind her 
so-called mother, and before Sasami could further elaborate, another 
brief vision flared before my mental eye. Almost too fast to pick up 
any details and almost too late to be of any use. The girl named 
Mizuki was already in the air, moving with her blades ready at 
breakneck speed towards the older woman, not knowing that she was 
aware of her daughter. &quot;Mizuki-san, watch out!&quot; I called out, 
wondering if it would make a difference.
	Fortunately it did. When her target suddenly turned to fire at 
her, she was long gone, vanishing into thin air and reappearing a good 
distance away as I had seen her do some times before. Unfortunately 
though, my interference had triggered the wrath of the older woman and 
before I knew it, she was suddenly focusing on us, or more like me. 
&quot;Annoying wrench.&quot;
	I barely had time to gasp when the yellow energy shot directly 
towards me. It was all happening too fast. Screw the theories of time 
slowing down in such situations. Before I became grilled though, 
gentle yet surprisingly strong hands grabbed me. I couldn&#39;t quite 
describe what it felt like. Being in one spot at one moment and at 
another at the next - actually we had barely moved an inch. I had been 
too paralyzed and probably terrified to pay much attention though. 
Only when I realized that I wasn&#39;t a pile of ash did I dare look up, 
seeing green eyes matching my rescuer&#39;s hair color looking back in a 
mix of concern and relief.
	&quot;That was close,&quot; stated Mizuki and I felt a curious tingle 
running through my body. I wondered what it was but had no real time 
to analyze it further. Mizuki&#39;s face hardened in anger as she turned 
back. &quot;That does it, Mother. Stop getting innocents involved in this 
or I really have to hurt you.&quot;
	Her mother didn&#39;t look very impressed. &quot;They are standing in my 
way.&quot; She glanced at where Sasami was getting back to her feet. &quot;And 
since it seems my Mistress was unable to take care of the young 
princess herself that I have to finish the job.&quot;
	&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Mizuki demanded in return, now 
clearly pissed off if she wasn&#39;t already before. This was the first 
time that our mutual suspicion that someone bigger was behind Mizuki&#39;s 
mother had been confirmed. And having that confirmed seemed to make 
the graceful girl even madder. Understandable enough. I could relate 
to that. When Van and Allan had fought with the intent to kill each 
other under the influence of Zaibach&#39;s Fate Redirector, I had been 
torn between disbelief and fury myself. And so I could very well 
understand the other&#39;s girl irritation.
	I just think neither of us expected a direct answer at that 
point.

******************************

(Sasami)
&quot;Tokimi,&quot; I breathed, still somewhat fuzzy from the prior ordeal and 
thus not really aware that at least those close to my position could 
hear me. I had been surprised, to say the least, to see Mizuki and her 
nominal mother/creator here. If anything this was an odd choice to 
make for my other half&#39;s sister. Not necessarily one I couldn&#39;t 
understand seeing as Kusumi had had her on taint already. But, she 
hardly was in the league of Kagato or even Clay who Tsunami had always 
suspected to knowingly or unknowingly work for the power-hungry 
elemental. Obviously she did not expect much resistance.
	&#39;Just like she underestimated me,&#39; I thought with a grim smile 
that quickly disappeared as I saw Sango and Rei - who was in what I 
believed to be her Senshi uniform - hard-pressed to divert a now close 
to enraged Kusumi. Mizuki just now left Hitomi&#39;s side and entered the 
fray once more. However, while I had missed everything that led to 
this point I could easily see that their efforts were and would remain 
fruitless. There was some sort of force field around Kusumi that 
seemed to absorb all their attacks. And it didn&#39;t take much for me to 
figure out what or better who was powering it.
	&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; Kagome asked, making me realize with a start what 
I had just said. But it hardly mattered now.
	&quot;Someone you don&#39;t want to mess with,&quot; I replied darkly, trying 
to concentrate through the fog that the spiritual attack had left in 
my mind. I still felt horribly alien in my own body since I still 
couldn&#39;t sense Tsunami, prompting the concern for my long-time 
companion to leak through once more. On impulse I glanced upwards, 
hoping to see some sign of her ship self. However, what I saw first 
made me blink in wonder and then a slow smile spread over my face. 
Now, I knew what was going on and glancing back at the other two girls 
at my side, a plan began to form. A plan to turn the tide in this 
battle, drastically.

******************************

(Kagome)
Sasami&#39;s gloomy statement made me shiver despite not able to attribute 
the name. I had a feeling it had something to do with her dryad. And 
if that was true I could easily see the magnitude there... or at least 
the general idea behind it since I still had no idea how strong the 
younger girl and her elemental friend were.
	I glanced worriedly towards the battle. Sango was getting weary, 
her earlier injury obviously taking its toll on her body. That was so 
like her. So... self-destructive. She had done the same thing many 
times before. For example when she heard of the attack on the rest of 
her village after just losing her father, brother and comrades. Naraku 
had tricked her into believing that Inuyasha was responsible and 
despite heavy injuries she pushed herself onwards, only a borrowed 
Shikon shard sustaining her will and ability to fight.
	Or that incident than Kohaku had nearly killed me the first 
time... Not to even mention the second time. After that last straw, I 
wondered if she might have really killed herself. It was very likely 
and the thought made my heart freeze with dread. I would not allow 
that though. As long as I was still breathing I would ensure that 
Sango could LIVE her life. Too much of its beauty had already been 
taken away from her.
	Sango wasn&#39;t the only one tiring though. Rei was still in good 
shape but the green-haired girl was showing signs of fatigue herself. 
And if both went down, there was no telling how long our nominal 
leader could hold off Kusumi. Something had to be done. And something 
had to be done now.
	&quot;Isn&#39;t there anything you can do?&quot; I half-whispered, keeping my 
voice low and puncturing the question with a meaningful look. It was 
hardly necessary since Hitomi was currently focused on the battle or 
more like entranced by the green-haired Mizuki who had just pretty 
much saved her life. I mentally shrugged and concentrated on Sasami 
again.
	&quot;No. Tokimi cut us off,&quot; she replied, getting the hint, &quot;The 
barrier around the Jinja keeps us separated somehow.&quot; I looked up 
automatically. I had sensed before that there was something blocking 
us off from the outside but wasn&#39;t very certain until now. It made 
some sense now, especially answering the question why Kirara with her 
acute senses hadn&#39;t been back yet. But if it was THAT barrier that was 
the key... &quot;Alone I doubt either of us can break it,&quot; Sasami picked up 
my thought. &quot;But together...&quot;
	&quot;Right,&quot; I said, gripping my bow firmly. &quot;What do we do?&quot;
	Sasami, however, turned first to Hitomi, who had torn her eyes 
away from the battle for the moment, with a questioning look. The 
brown-haired girl obviously caught the last part and nodded slowly. 
&quot;Alone I don&#39;t have enough power at the moment to break Tokimi&#39;s 
control over Kusumi. However, with your ability to break any kinds of 
spells,&quot; she nodded towards me, &quot;and your ability to see the hidden,&quot; 
now she nodded at Hitomi, &quot;we can at least break the barrier that her 
energy is powering.&quot; She reached out with both her hands. &quot;Give me 
your hands.&quot;
	Hesitantly Hitomi took Sasami&#39;s one hand while I took the other. 
&quot;I will now have to link our spirits together. It might feel a little 
weird but this way I can focus our individual abilities better. First 
I will help Hitomi in locating the exact origin point of Tokimi&#39;s 
energy. When we have it I will relate that point to you, Kagome, and 
then we&#39;ll lend you as much power as we can. All that you have to do 
when is to hit it.&quot;
	&quot;Right,&quot; I said sarcastically. &quot;Easy enough.&quot; Actually, hitting 
something when I knew where to hit was really no problem anymore. 
Before the final merging my skill had been more instinctual, now I 
KNEW exactly what was the best place to hit something in order to 
bring maximum results.
	Green energy began to glow around Sasami and then began to 
envelop Sango before I felt it touch myself. My first reflex was to 
pull away but I managed to resist it, only wincing when I saw Sango 
take another near hit that sent her to the ground. This had to work. 
It just had to. I felt the Shikon no Tama glow and drew some inner 
strength from it. I had been hard pressed to actually use it but was 
glad that maybe there didn&#39;t seem a need to do so. Nonetheless I 
extracted just a bit of energy from the vast pool.
	At first I thought I had unconsciously taken too much but then I 
realized that it was the energy of the other two girls flowing into 
me. &quot;Do it now,&quot; Sasami breathed and I realized she had let go of our 
hands as well as dropped to her knees in obvious exhaustion. I turned 
back to the battle and... Well, I couldn&#39;t really describe it. I 
thought I would see something extraordinary. Some glowing point of 
light that indicated my target. Instead I simply KNEW where to aim. I 
would have to ask Hitomi how exactly her abilities worked, but that 
was for another time. For now there was something more important to 
do.
	Drawing an arrow from my quiver I had it lined up in a heartbeat 
and was pushing all the stored up energy into it, presenting me with 
the rather spectacular side of the arrow actually glowing in a bright 
white before I even released it.
	It was now or never.

******************************

(Rei)
&quot;Rei, DODGE!&quot;
	Years of battle instincts made me heed the warning cry from my 
back and I dove forward and into an evasive roll. Moments later I felt 
an intense wave of spiritual force pass overhead and I looked up in 
amazement at the blazing arrow flying towards our foe... and missing 
the target completely.
	I blinked in confusion, staring after the projectile continuing 
onwards. Kusumi laughed and glanced at Kagome. &quot;You should work on 
your aim.&quot;
	&quot;Are you so certain about that?&quot; the dark-haired girl replied, 
confidently. And that was when I understood. Kusumi or her own shield 
was never the target. It was the other barrier around the shrine that 
was keeping us closed off. I was half-surprised that I was even able 
to reach my planet in order to transform since that huge barrier 
obviously blocked all energy from outside and inside. That was a wild 
guess, mind you, but as I was to learn later, a pretty good one.
	Kusumi whirled around, obviously getting the message. All too 
late though. The arrow impacted on a seemingly random point in a 
bright flare and as if made out of glass the entire dome shattered and 
with it - I noted - most of the older woman&#39;s own shield. I had kept 
an eye on the power level of that shield, trying to see if it would 
weaken over time. Now most of its quality seemed to be rapidly 
draining away and what was left was but a mere fraction of the former 
glory.
	I reacted immediately, bringing my hands together, I drew on the 
rest of my reserves for one last attack. &quot;MARS SNAKE FIRE!&quot; Flames 
merged together into a huge snake-like apparition and slammed into 
Kusumi&#39;s remaining shield, momentarily obscuring her form. When they 
died down the woman was still standing but now with only her armor as 
protection.
	Which was not very much as Mizuki proved materializing just 
above Kusumi with a grim smile of anticipated satisfaction for all the 
trouble her mother had given her. &quot;You forgot a helmet, Mother,&quot; she 
quipped before striking hard with her foot at the unprepared woman who 
collapsed in an unceremonious heap, bringing a somewhat anti-climatic 
end to the battle.
	Not that I cared much. I permitted myself a sigh of relief on my 
own, feeling the adrenaline from the battle drain away. My first 
concern was with Sasami though. And once glance in her direction was 
enough to get me moving despite my body&#39;s protests. All the running 
around had made me see that I horribly neglected practice as of late. 
I would have to put in some extra endurance training.
	That could come later though. Now I had to make sure that Sasami 
was alright. And then there was something I had to tell her. This 
morning&#39;s battle and the horrible long minutes in which I had been 
uncertain what had happened to the younger girl and where I was unable 
to do something had torn the last bit of reluctance on my part to 
pieces. I could have lost her today and I doubted I could have dealt 
with that. I would make sure that she knew it. And no secrets or 
mysteries would keep me from that.
	Slowly I approached the mostly passive - but in the end rather 
decisive - group. I tried to reign in my anxiety at the sight. It was 
obvious that the reason for Sasami&#39;s current state was mostly 
exhaustion. I had no idea what exactly it was that she had done and 
right now it didn&#39;t matter very much. Despite all my efforts, the 
first thing that came out of my mouth after kneeling down next to her 
was, &quot;Hey, are you alright?&quot;
	Sasami looked up and just then I realized that I was still in my 
Senshi guise and she hadn&#39;t seen me transform. I got a thorough 
surprise though as pinkish eyes glanced up with unconcealed affection. 
&quot;I&#39;m fine, Rei, just tired.&quot; She missed my astonished look because the 
next moment the blue-haired girl snuggled against me comfortably. 
Instinctively I wrapped my arms around her before I could even 
question the action.
	&quot;It&#39;s okay, you can rest now,&quot; I assured, momentarily ignoring 
everything else around me and thus not noticing the knowing look of 
Kagome.
	Sasami shifted a little in my arms, making herself more 
comfortably. I didn&#39;t really mind. I was so scared when I came out and 
found her passed out, on the verge of death, it had nearly cost me my 
own concentration and my own life in the process during the battle. 
&quot;Just need a moment to reconnect,&quot; Sasami mumbled and while I was 
still wondering what she meant, she added, &quot;Tsunami-chan...&quot; A blue 
glow momentarily engulfed her. It was by no means unsettling. In fact 
the sensation as the otherworldly energy brushed against my 
hypersensitive senses was one of peace and full with life. It was 
reassuring and... grateful. &#39;The same presence I always feel around 
her since she&#39;s came to stay with me,&#39; I thought. &#39;Does it have 
anything to do with what she fears I won&#39;t understand.&#39;
	I doubted Sasami even knew what she said, clearly in a state of 
mind that was less than fully conscious. I felt a little bad about 
witnessing what had obviously not been for me to see, yet. On the 
other hand Sasami seemed to know about my secret as well... Don&#39;t get 
me wrong. I wasn&#39;t really angry about that. Just curious. There was 
hardly anything that I could not forgive the younger girl. Because...
	Yes. Because I had fallen in love with her.
	I knew now. Beyond a doubt. The fear of losing her had been so 
overwhelming. I couldn&#39;t deny it anymore. Sasami had made me 
experience and trust in love again where I had thought it wasn&#39;t for 
me anymore. Like an angel she had descended into my life and brought 
her light into it, making me see and experience things I didn&#39;t have 
before. And that was something I intended to tell her once she was 
fully recovered there was no putting this off any longer.
	I finally tore my eyes away from the girl in my arms - but 
making no move to let her go - and looked around at the scene of the 
recent battle. The yard looked like a miniature war zone. Not all THAT 
bad but repairs would surely take some time. Which is fine with me. I 
think we all need some more relaxing after this, I noted by surveying 
the state of our group. Beside our own physical and spiritual 
exhaustion, there was Sango who had taken quite a few nasty hits and 
had not even bothered to get up again, following the conclusion 
groggily in a sitting position. The younger girl, Mizuki, was a bit 
winded herself as she was checking over her alleged mother. While they 
had just thought bitterly a moment ago, it was obvious that she was 
still very concerned.
	&quot;Okay,&quot; I said with as much firmness as I could muster. 
&quot;Everyone who needs to rest, go take a nap. I think we all need it. We 
can make recap later. We are all tired and some of us need to get 
treated.&quot; There were mumbles of agreement all around us. I turned to 
Mizuki and her mother and called out, &quot;Mizuki-san?&quot; The girl turned 
around to look back questioningly. This was probably against my better 
judgment and I put a lot on the notion that the older woman would now 
be free of whatever had control over her. &quot;If you make sure she 
doesn&#39;t go berserk again, you can put her in one of the guest rooms.&quot; 
Mizuki seemed surprised but also thankful. I really wasn&#39;t in a state 
to care though. All I wanted to do right now was bringing Sasami back 
inside and to get her some rest.
	And of course, to do that other thing.

******************************

(Sango)
&#39;What a mess,&#39; I thought darkly, surveying the damage done to the 
yard. Thankfully enough, besides some darkened areas the buildings had 
evaded the most damage. The holes in the yard, caused by energy beams, 
and the easily visible scorch marks from Rei&#39;s fire attacks had 
created quite a bit of damage. Since the barrier was now down, Rei&#39;s 
grandfather had to close down the Jinja for awhile, in order to 
conduct repairs. Fortunately - relatively spoken - Mizuki&#39;s mother had 
offered to fix the damage. Don&#39;t ask me how. As I understood it by 
now, those two weren&#39;t even from this planet which explained their 
strange abilities. In fact, now that the entire thing was over and 
done with, they - especially the older scientist named Kusumi - 
appeared to be quite nice fellows. The most amazing thing was though 
that Kusumi did not remember a single thing about what she had done or 
about this Tokimi character. Sasami told us afterwards that that was 
how Tokimi usually worked and left it at that. As fresh as the battle 
weariness still was, no one dared to ask for further details and the 
blue-haired girl seemed confident that something like this wouldn&#39;t 
happen again. At least not very soon.
	I sat down on the porch, feeling quite tired myself from all the 
fighting done just a couple of hours ago. Kagome would probably be 
angry with me for not resting longer, however, my adrenaline value was 
still pretty high. I hadn&#39;t fought this hard since the final battle 
with Naraku over a year ago. In fact I hadn&#39;t fought a serious battle 
since then. &#39;I must be getting rusty.&#39; Usually I could go much longer 
than I had today.
	&quot;Wasn&#39;t I clear enough, saying that you should REST?&quot; the stern 
voice of my lover sounded directly behind my ear. I had to beat down 
my racing heartbeat and the impulse to jump.
	Guiltily I risked a glance to the side as the other girl sat 
down next to me. However, what I saw was not so much full-fledged fury 
but more a mixture of heavy concern and an iron determination. &#39;Uh oh. 
Not good,&#39; I thought.
	&quot;You had me scared out there,&quot; Kagome continued, not letting me 
speak up to begin with. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t take such risks.&quot; Her voice had 
an unmistakable edge to it and if I hadn&#39;t so far, now I definitely 
knew how Inuyasha had to have felt in these kind of situations. Just 
like him though, I also would retaliate. Not so much because I didn&#39;t 
know any better but more because I had good reasons. Or at least I 
thought that I did.
	&quot;Well, excuse me. It was either that or us. And I&#39;d rather die 
than let anything happen to you,&quot; I replied, equally determined. This 
was the full truth and she knew it. I had lost so much already, pretty 
much everything had been taken from me. Family, friends, most of my 
life. All that I had left was Kagome and if something happened to her 
and I would live to see it... I doubted that I would survive it, 
literally.
	Kagome looked at me and her eyes were swinging between being 
moved and irritation. &quot;That&#39;s not what I mean!&quot; she finally shouted 
and made me flinch back. However, I was halted immediately by a 
surprisingly firm arm over my shoulders pulling me close. &quot;You&#39;ve 
always been doing this,&quot; my lover continued in a more hushed tone, 
&quot;Ever since I knew you, you have been pushing yourself beyond your 
limits. You are knowingly taking the risk to your own life into 
account.&quot; She paused briefly and took a slow breath before continuing, 
&quot;Because you think there is no reason for you to go on, no one left to 
cry over you.&quot; Another pause and another breath. And then there was 
The Look. &quot;But, Sango, if you really meant it when you first told me 
that you were in love with me, then there is someone who will be very 
sad if you were to be gone.&quot;
	There were a few tears glimmering in her eyes and it made my own 
heart ache at the intensity of feeling directed at me. I knew better 
than to argue with her than she had That Look. Inuyasha usually tended 
to run, I found it rather adoring actually. And the appreciation of 
being favored with IT was definitely worth the emotional chaos. I 
reached out to brush away the tears but Kagome caught my hand and held 
it to her heart. &quot;You have me, Sango-chan, and you have the others 
now, too. You are not alone.&quot;
	And that was the truth, I realized with a start, snuggling 
closer to the other girl, into the protective warmth of her embrace. 
&quot;Hai, I am.&quot; I didn&#39;t argue just because it was the healthy thing to 
do - and believe me I wasn&#39;t exaggerating - but also because I knew, 
deep in my heart, that what she said was true and what I thought 
earlier was long past. I had a life again. I had friends and a quasi 
family again. I had Kagome. There was no need for me to be fatalistic 
anymore.

******************************

(Mizuki)
With a good bit of melancholy, I stared after my mother&#39;s ship as it 
ascended into orbit and then above it. She had really taken it hard. I 
had expected some guilt, hoped for a bit more but nothing so... 
drastic. Logically, I knew this might be for the best but my heart 
tried to come up with a number of - quite valid - reasons that could 
have stopped her. In the end, I hadn&#39;t. Mother had simply been too 
determined... or more like too depressed to argue with.
	I really hadn&#39;t expected her too take it this hard. It was true 
that we had become a lot closer over the last two years, as mother and 
daughter should be. However, I had been surprised to see the 
unconcealed shock in her face when I told my mother about the battle 
and when I mentioned that she had not hesitated to kill me as well. I 
suppose I had not noticed many of the inner changes Kusumi had 
undergone since her defeat at the hands of Tenchi-tachi and myself. 
This was hardly too surprising, seeing as she was a scientist and 
usually not all that much for deeper emotions. She never really was 
the type for typical family, love and all that stuff either. I had 
gotten used to it. Her feelings had been made clear through other 
things and I had learned to recognize them. Only with the degree I had 
done some obvious misjudgment it would seem.
	I became aware of a presence behind me. It was the girl from 
earlier, the one that had saved my butt with her vital warning. True, 
I had repaid that debt but if not for me she wouldn&#39;t have triggered 
Mother&#39;s attention anyway. I wasn&#39;t entirely sure why she followed me 
out here, a few blocks away from the Jinja in the back of a deserted 
building that had sufficient landing space but I intended to find out.
	&quot;Do you usually spy on other people,&quot; I asked teasingly, only 
turning around when I heard a satisfying squeak. I gave the girl a 
smile, meaning to reassure her that I wasn&#39;t really angry. It didn&#39;t 
help much.
	&quot;Ah... no... that is...&quot; the girl - Hitomi I think was her name 
- stuttered and then quickly tried to change the subject. &quot;Um, not to 
intrude on family business but...&quot;
	&quot;Was it the right thing to let her go?&quot; I completed, expecting 
the question easily enough. I was asking myself the same thing after 
all. Mother had not lost many words on her reasons but said after she 
heard that I had almost been killed by her, twice, that she decided 
she could not be around anyone for awhile until she got her feelings 
under control. It was irresponsible in my opinion, to take something 
so hard that wasn&#39;t even your - conscious - fault, but Kusumi had 
seemed so devastated I had relented quickly enough.
	&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure,&quot; I spoke eventually, seeing as the other 
girl was obviously too flustered to say something. &quot;She needs to work 
through some stuff. Being controlled like that... She took it harder 
than even I thought.&quot; I sighed. &quot;Mother has always been eccentric and 
irrational. In fact,&quot; I added with a smirk, &quot;I rather prefer that than 
the way she&#39;s been under this Tokimi person&#39;s control.&quot;
	&quot;And what are you going to do now?&quot; The question surprised me 
since it was voiced with a definite edge to it that I doubted the 
brown-haired girl was even aware of. There had been some sort of 
curious reaction when I saved her from one of Mother&#39;s attacks which&#39;s 
meaning I wasn&#39;t entirely sure about.
	I shrugged it off for the moment. &quot;I&#39;ll stick around to help 
with the damage at least. I feel somewhat responsible. After that, I&#39;m 
not sure. But it seemed Her Highness is in desperate need of some 
protection.&quot; I said the last bit jokingly. I wasn&#39;t really sure what I 
was supposed to do on my own. Maybe I could really spent some time 
here on Earth. The planets we usually visited were often not very 
enjoyable and only good for research and scientific purposes.
	&quot;Well,&quot; Hitomi replied, more relaxed - if not actually relieved, 
&quot;I was going to work there part-time. I have to say if it is always 
this exciting there...&quot; She smiled. She had a pretty smile, I thought, 
and then blinked mentally.
	Trying to cover my reaction, I grinned and asked in return, &quot;Too 
much excitement?&quot;
	Hitomi put her hands on her hips indignantly. &quot;You wish. I&#39;ve 
seen worse.&quot;
	&#39;Well, what do you know? She certainly is a quick-witted one,&#39; I 
mused, feeling instantly warming up to the other girl. Maybe the time 
separated from my mother wouldn&#39;t be so lonely after all as I had 
first thought. &quot;Should we head back then,&quot; I asked and extended my arm 
in mock-curtsey. I was really surprised when she took the cue and 
linked her arm through mine, giving me a winning smile. &#39;I&#39;m not 
exactly sure what is going on,&#39; I mused, &#39;but I won&#39;t complain.&#39; It 
seemed I had just made a friend without really trying. And I certainly 
wouldn&#39;t complain about that.

******************************

(Sasami)
I hadn&#39;t been able to rest much. Not because I was too excited from 
the recent events. In fact I felt much calmer right now than I had 
ever before. A bit older, more mature. No, that wasn&#39;t it. The simple 
truth was that the fatigue from the battle had vanished shortly after 
the barrier dropped and the essential connection between Tsunami and I 
was reestablished.
	It was nice to know how much you were appreciated and how much 
everyone cared. They had all been so worried about me when I had been 
caught in Tokimi&#39;s trap. Not just Rei, but everyone. I had always 
craved other&#39;s attention but I rarely ever saw me as all that 
important. Especially after the incident in the Tree Chamber. I had 
learnt to better understand what happened there but in the back of my 
mind there had always been the lurking doubt about my self-worth. 
Tokimi&#39;s words had cut deep into that old wound and almost managed to 
become fatal. But then I had remembered Rei and how much she needed me 
around. It wasn&#39;t a selfish thought, just a realization. We both had 
begun to depend on each other a lot in the last months since we first 
met. What we had was just as much a symbiotic relationship as Tsunami 
and I had. And that realization in the end had served me to find new 
courage within myself to withstand Tokimi.
	I stopped my slow stroll through the mostly untouched back of 
the yard, behind the buildings, when I felt Rei behind me. Kagome and 
Sango were sitting in our place, so to say, and they had looked so 
content that I didn&#39;t wish to interrupt. I had been expecting a 
different reaction though, not quite as forceful and direct as being 
wrapped up in a tight embrace and pulled back against the taller frame 
of the older miko. Not that I complained. Hardly that. The closeness 
was definitely nice but it also had something desperate that I had not 
much trouble to understand.
	&quot;Don&#39;t ever do that again,&quot; Rei whispered, her voice trembling. 
I didn&#39;t need her to continue to know that she was certainly not just 
referring to me already wandering around after being close to death 
just a few hours ago. It was more the close to death part that was of 
importance. &quot;I don&#39;t care who or what you are and what secrets you are 
keeping from me. But, don&#39;t ever scare me like that again. I don&#39;t 
know what I would do if you left...&quot;
	I didn&#39;t reply immediately, relishing in the feel of the other 
girl&#39;s close presence and the reassurance both of us were able to draw 
from it. I could very well sympathize with her feelings. When I told 
her yesterday that I was going to put them all into danger, it had 
held true. However, I had not expected something like that to happen. 
Tsunami hadn&#39;t sensed her sibling behind this either and was still 
quite miffed about the incident. Actually she had been worried to 
death, distracted by her own battle with Kusumi&#39;s ship she had felt 
our bond temporally break but had been unable to do something about 
it. It had been frustrating I could tell.
	But I knew now that the others would have insisted to fight for 
my sake even if I had told them what I knew, even if I had known what 
was really going to happen. It would have made hardly any difference. 
There would have been little they could have done against someone like 
Tokimi.
	And yet they had still tried to protect me nonetheless. Because 
I was important to them, as their friend, and in Rei&#39;s case so much 
more. That was what friends and loved ones did after all for each 
other and, if anything, our group showed that there wasn&#39;t a need to 
know every little important detail about the other&#39;s past to develop 
trust and friendship.
	Turning in the embrace I reached up to touch the older girl&#39;s 
face. &quot;I don&#39;t want to leave either. I doubt either of us can at this 
point. We&#39;ve come too far.&quot; I felt much more comfortable now with 
myself and in knowing Rei&#39;s feelings. I didn&#39;t need her to tell me, 
the last doubts had been extinguished during the recent event. There 
was no need for me to doubt her feelings anymore. Everything that was 
really important had been said or done already.
	And so I didn&#39;t hesitate to lean my head on her shoulder and 
pressing my body closer against hers. There was a new harmony there. 
No hesitation anymore on either part. If anything, the experiences 
from earlier had made me see just how much I needed Rei, how much we 
needed each other.
	&quot;I can hardly believe it&#39;s only been roughly four months since 
we met.&quot; I knew what she meant. It felt like I had known the older 
girl much longer than that.
	&quot;We&#39;ve been so awkward then,&quot; I replied wistfully. I could still 
remember it vividly, that first meeting. Neither Tsunami or I had ever 
experienced something remotely close to this before. Love on first 
sight. While I hadn&#39;t immediately wanted to acknowledge it, the truth 
was that it had been like that. Our meeting had been fated, that I was 
sure about.
	I lifted my head to meet Rei&#39;s purple eyes and felt like 
drowning in so much open emotion directed at me. The love there was 
undeniable now and I felt like an idiot for not seeing it earlier. I 
had been scared, scared of rejection and so, even though I already 
admitted to myself that I loved Rei, I had been scared to be 
disappointed again. A foolish thought, I knew now. Rei was a good 
person. Compassionate and understanding if you just managed to see 
past her sometimes rough exterior.
	I became gradually aware of one of Rei&#39;s hands softly stroking 
through my hair and was torn between the impulse to close my eyes or 
continue to meet this intense gaze. In the end the latter was too 
strong. I just couldn&#39;t avert my eyes.
	There was so much to talk about, so many questions I was sure 
Rei had, but that seemed furthest from her mind right now. There was a 
quiet but unwavering determination there that made me shudder 
slightly. Rei leaned her forehead against mine. &quot;That day, just before 
I met you, I wished for someone in my life to share my burden, someone 
that could show me love. Then you came and my wish was answered.&quot; Her 
other hand came around from my back to tilt my head upwards, making me 
meet her eyes again, and then began caressing my face. I stood 
mesmerized, patiently waiting for her to finish. To say what I 
expected, hoped, wanted to hear.
	Nothing of the sort came, not immediately anyway, but I could 
easily forgive that since the exquisite feeling of Rei&#39;s lips ever so 
gently brushing against mine was telling enough. At first it was only 
soft and slow but quickly became deeper and more passionate. Where the 
kiss yesterday had been mostly promising, this was more, so much more. 
My eyes closed on their own accord as I wrapped my own arms around the 
older miko&#39;s waist. This was a confirmation. Not just a confirmation 
of Rei&#39;s feelings but also of my own, of the fact that she was the 
right one for me. That we were the right one&#39;s for each other. The 
harmony that surrounded us could not be challenged, nothing could 
touch us right now. No secrets, no revelations, no barriers. It was 
just us now. Everything else could come later.
	*Tsunami,* I thought contently, assured now that nothing could 
ever change what we had right now. *Get us up.&quot; And as I distantly 
felt space warp around me, still too lost in the ocean of feelings, I 
knew that I found my place in this galaxy. The place where I truly 
belonged.

THE END
(to be totally resolved in the following epilogues though)

Phew, that last bit - mostly the battle - took me longer than I 
expected it to. The biggest problem was probably my tendency to be 
overcritical of my own work. I had been in one of these states where 
nothing totally seemed to please me from somewhere after the hot 
spring sequence onwards. And regardless of the fact that Ay set me 
straight and told me that it was all pretty much okay, there were 
still a lot of things I wanted to mention but never got to chance 
though. There are still the epilogues to resolve some stuff after all 
(and the Main arcs too) but still...
Okay, I stop to lament about my tendency for perfectionism when I am 
writing and get to the notes... ^_^

Okay, first of, regarding Hitomi (since I dealt with Mizuki in the 
beginning). I base what I know on my spare recollection of the anime. 
I did read some summaries before I got to writing her (reading the 
scripts I did have available was a little too time consuming). I admit 
I take the most liberties with her character and she might not be 
exactly how you remember her. Keep in mind though that all of the 
characters here are older and a few years have passed since canon 
events. I&#39;ll try to keep changes in reasonable dimensions though 
and/or explain the events leading to them properly at an appropriate 
point.
Another note for Mizuki. For all who actually played the game. I 
always thought there was only one ending but I think it depends on 
what characters you play/recruit/level up etc... I ran through it 
quickly before I came to the last two thirds introducing Mizuki and 
Hitomi again and the comment about the computer virus was from the 
alternate ending I suddenly got (compared to the usual one with Ryoko 
and Ayeka ending up fighting as usual) where Washu explained that she 
&quot;accidentally&quot; sent some computer virus into Kusumi&#39;s network but that 
could hardly have been the cause for her attack. The others are 
worried then what Kusumi will do if she gets home and discovers the 
virus... Just for those of you who are curious about these details.
If you ask about the Rain Trees (since Meg did when I posted the first 
sequence on the SiL list). I refer you once again to Volume 11. 
Casablanca Memory.

And that was that. For the main parts at least. The epilogues will 
resolve mostly around background issues, especially for Tenchi Muyo 
and Inuyasha since a lot of question have still been left open. Many 
because I wanted them to, some because they simply didn&#39;t fit in.

Since I&#39;m starting university life in a couple of days (well, I START 
in about two weeks but oh well...) I&#39;m not sure when I can get to 
writing again. So the epilogues, continuing SL&#39;s main arc or anything 
else writing-wise for that matter might have to wait. It all depends 
on how hectic things get. So bear with me, if you don&#39;t get anything 
to read from me again in the next few months. I&#39;ll try my best but 
can&#39;t give any promises.

Feedback as always is definitely welcome by the ever-hungry muse and 
author. You should know the drill by now.

Ja ne, yours
