Washu smiled as she hummed away, studying the readouts
in her lab. &quot;Well, well,&quot; the redheaded scientist
said, &quot;you&#39;re actually getting stronger, Ryouko.&quot;

Ryouko stood there impatiently, the catlike eyes
narrowed a little as she tapped a foot. Bands of
golden light washed over her body as she waited in the
chamber, her nude form pale in the dim lights of the
massive chamber. &quot;Are you going to be done soon?&quot; she
asked, &quot;I feel like I&#39;ve been standing here for
hours.&quot;

&quot;Just a few moments more,&quot; Washu hummed to herself
happily. The petite figure studied a image on another
one of the screens floating around her even as she
cheerfully asked, &quot;So have you and Tenchi... done it,
yet?&quot;

&quot;Washu!&quot; Ryouko growled.

&quot;I&#39;d rather you called me momma,&quot; Washu chuckled, &quot;or
at least little Washu.&quot; She looked up impishly, &quot;Well,
have you?&quot;

Ryouko hesitated, then a sly smile appeared on her
face as the blushing woman firmly said, &quot;None of your
business.&quot;

&quot;But as your mother I&#39;m merely interested in seeing
your development as a woman,&quot; Washu protested
innocently.

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Ryouko rolled her eyes.

Finally Washu shut down the scanning device, finding
Ryouko&#39;s usual bodysuit and bringing it over for her.
Switching tracks she said seriously, &quot;It looks like
you&#39;ve fully recovered from your captivity by Kagato.
In fact, you&#39;re nearly in peak health.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ryouko said as she pulled on her top, a
thoughtful expression on her face. &quot;Washu...&quot; she
started, then trailed off.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Washu asked curiously.

&quot;You know that we&#39;re coming up on a Earth holiday
called Christmas, right?&quot; Ryouko asked her, looking
oddly uncomfortable.

&quot;A seasonal holiday, probably dating back to primitive
festivals on this world,&quot; Washu noted, &quot;Jurai has a
similar one. Why?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to give Tenchi a gift,&quot; Ryouko finished
dressing by pulling her boots on, &quot;but I&#39;m not sure
what to give her.&quot;

Washu considered teasing her daughter, but something
in her eyes held her back, a gentle caring the girl
rarely showed. &quot;Have you tried asking Yosho?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;He claims that he&#39;s not sure what to get her, too,&quot;
Ryouko chuckled to herself, thinking of the older man
wryly. Learning that the man who had once defeated her
in battle, Yosho, had retired to this world as
Katsuhito Masaki was still something she was getting
used to, even though she did find herself liking him,
oddly.

&quot;I could always make her something,&quot; Washu offered,
&quot;but I&#39;m not sure one of my inventions would suit
her.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Ryouko visibly winced, remembering the
havoc Washu&#39;s robotic double had caused only a few
days ago. She had built the thing to help out with
cooking now that Sasami was gone, but things had gone
wrong pretty quickly. &quot;Thanks for the offer though,&quot;
Ryouko sweatdropped as she added, &quot;little Washu.&quot;

Washu laughed happily, then bodily slapped Ryouko on
the butt. &quot;Head upstairs,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure
your young lady will be back soon.&quot;

&quot;Watch the hands,&quot; Ryouko growled, flickering as she
teleported out of the room, only to reappear in the
main hallway of the house.

The Masaki shrine had started out as a fairly normal
temple, but with the semi-permanent arrival of her and
Washu certain alterations had been made. Using
advanced technology and equipment that Washu stored in
a pocket dimension she built a home for them nearby
the shrine, just beside a blue lake. Tenchi&#39;s father
had also come out to contribute to the designs the
architect helping the structure fit in to human norms.

The top floor was a kitchen, several bedrooms, a large
bath and so on, while underneath the home Washu had
parked her laboratory, A massive structure it was
bigger inside than outside, quite possibly twice the
size of the house itself. Washu left the lab only to
cook and interact with Tenchi and Ryouko, becoming a
almost motherly figure.

Ryouko strode out onto the porch that circled the
house, smiling as she saw the snow falling gently from
the sky. Uncontrolled weather was yet another thing
she was getting used to here, but it could be oddly
pleasant.

&quot;Myah?&quot; Ryo-Ohki asked as she looked up at her
curiously, the little cabbit having slipped out of the
house unobserved.

&quot;Tenchi&#39;s not back yet,&quot; Ryouko answered, &quot;but I think
she&#39;ll be back from training soon.&quot;

Just then she saw Tenchi walking up the path, the
young woman untying her pony tail while still carrying
her practice sword. With a gesture her long black hair
flowed free, going well with the simple jacket and
pants the young woman habitually wore.

&quot;Hey, Ryouko,&quot; Tenchi waved, her eyes lighting up with
happiness, then she winced as if her shoulder was
plaguing her.

Ryouko smiled as she walked up, &quot;Is that mean old man
beating up on you?&quot;

&quot;Grandfather sprung a new trick on me today,&quot; Tenchi
agreed, bending down to scratch behind the cabbit&#39;s
ears.

&quot;Myah!&quot; Ryo-Ohki exclaimed happily, rubbing gently
against her hand.

&quot;And you&#39;re a little annoyed by falling for it,&quot;
Ryouko noted as she slipped her hand into Tenchi&#39;s,
the two women heading inside together.

&quot;I guess I am,&quot; Tenchi confessed.

Ryouko squeezed her fingers comfortingly, &quot;Love,
you&#39;ve got to remember that he&#39;s had centuries to
learn every dirty trick and tactic you can think of.&quot;
She flashed a sudden smile, &quot;To be honest, I&#39;m
impressed you&#39;re doing as well as you do.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Tenchi brightened a bit. They went into
the living room together, sitting down on one of the
couches. &quot;So who gets to make dinner tonight?&quot; she
asked, nervously sliding an arm over Ryouko&#39;s
shoulders.

With a happy sigh Ryouko leaned in to Tenchi, letting
her head rest on her shoulder. &quot;Mine, probably,&quot; she
admitted, &quot;maybe I should order take out?&quot;

&quot;I can help you make some soup, maybe,&quot; Tenchi
countered gently, the two of them relaxing there for a
few moments.

&quot;Tenchi,&quot; Ryouko murmured softly, &quot;what do you want
for Christmas?&quot;

Tenchi reached out to gently stroke the blue hair away
from Ryouko&#39;s face, smiling down at her tenderly. &quot;But
I already have everything I could want for Christmas,&quot;
she said to her quietly, &quot;you&#39;re here with me.&quot;

Ryouko looked up at her, eyes soft and warm. &quot;You&#39;re a
romantic, Tenchi,&quot; she murmured as she cupped Tenchi&#39;s
face, &quot;and I love you for it.&quot; Smoothly she drew
Tenchi down into a kiss, at first delicate, then with
a greater hunger.

Tenchi moaned softly as she felt her breasts press
against Ryouko&#39;s as the woman wrapped her arms around
her. Smoothly Ryouko tugged her down sideways on the
couch, refusing to break the kiss eve as they lay down
together.

&quot;This is not a good idea,&quot; Tenchi said breathlessly,
&quot;Washu could walk in....&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; and Ryouko licked along the other
woman&#39;s neck, nibbling gently. &quot;Watch out for me,&quot; she
purred in Tenchi&#39;s ear, &quot;I bite.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want you any other way,&quot; Tenchi managed to
get out then she moaned as Ryouko sucked hungrily on
her neck. Her own hands began to gently explore
Ryouko&#39;s body beneath her clothes, enjoying the moans
she could cause the other woman, too.

&quot;You know just what to say,&quot; Ryouko laughed throatily.

Completely unnoticed Washu smiled from the living room
door, listening and watching with some degree of
amusement. &quot;I think we&#39;ll just leave them alone for
now,&quot; Washu told Ryo-Ohki as Tenchi&#39;s shirt went
flying, soon followed by Ryouko&#39;s.

&quot;Myah,&quot; Ryo-Ohki agreed.

Picking up the cabbit Washu chuckled, &quot;Besides which,
Ryouko would probably kill us if we interrupted them
now.&quot;

End

Notes: I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to leave this
alone... Why did Washu build the house? In the
original OVA Ryouko swiped the Masaki household during
her battle with Ayeka, but since I had her avoid doing
that in &#39;No Need for Boys&#39; I had to come up with a
different place for them to live.</pre>
