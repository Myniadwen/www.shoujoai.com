<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The brown haired woman waited impatiently for the ship to dock. A soft 
chime rang out, the hatch opened, and the young woman visibly tensed. 
Figures filed out quickly, then slowed to a trickle as a look of 
disappointment crossed her face.

Then a drooping figure stepped out, visibly tired. She looked up, and 
her face visibly brightened as she exclaimed, &quot;Honor!&quot;

Honor Harrington ran forward, pulling the dark skinned woman into a 
fierce hug. Then she drew back a moment and kissed her thoroughly. 
&quot;I&#39;ve missed you, Michelle,&quot; Honor sighed.

Her fellow Captain, Michelle Henke said softly, &quot;Missed you too, 
love.&quot; She chuckled softly, &quot;I should go on extended patrol 
assignments more often, if you&#39;re going to react like this.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare,&quot; Honor smiled, before breaking away. &quot;I&#39;ve got to get 
back to the bridge,&quot; she apologized, &quot;but could we meet in our 
quarters later?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Michelle grinned, and watched her lover sprint away. She 
picked up her duffel bag from where she dropped it, and headed off to 
report in.

Michelle walked down the hall, then she stiffened and tried to take on 
a more military bearing as she noticed who was walking right towards 
her. &#39;The Empress herself, and beside her, wasn&#39;t that the Princess of 
Jurai&#39;s royal family?&#39; she thought wildly.

&quot;At ease,&quot; Ryouko smiled at her as she walked past. Michelle visibly 
puffed out a breath in pure relief.

&quot;You&#39;re not quite comfortable with that sort of military courtesy,&quot; 
Ayeka noted, looking at the expression on Ryouko&#39;s face.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; Ryouko admitted. &quot;Manticore&#39;s never had such a 
formalized military, but soon after we began to expand, we ran into 
and absorbed the Gryphon system fleet. Some of our best officers are 
from there, but they use a regimented system. Combine that with my 
lead Captain Kiyone&#39;s ideas, and I guess I&#39;m stuck with it.&quot;

Ayeka chuckled softly, trying to hide her nervousness. There was so 
much she wanted to say, but she couldn&#39;t seem to find the words.

&quot;I already apologized,&quot; Ryouko quietly said as she suddenly came to a 
complete stop, &quot;and I meant it.&quot;

Ayeka stopped and looked over at her in surprise, wondering if the 
Empress of Manticore could read minds as well. &#39;How did she know?&#39; she 
thought.

&quot;But I don&#39;t regret what I did,&quot; Ryouko blushed faintly, &quot;or maybe I 
should say that I&#39;ll only regret it if it drives you away from me.&quot;

Ayeka blushed as well, looking away from Ryouko shyly. &quot;You don&#39;t 
mince words, do you?&quot; she said, smiling slightly.

&quot;I don&#39;t do it very well,&quot; Ryouko admitted, &quot;so I try not to very 
often.&quot; She gently slid a hand under Ayeka&#39;s elbow to urge her forward 
again. They walked for a few moments silently, both lost in their own 
thoughts.

&quot;You said you wanted to marry me,&quot; Ayeka said with a bit of irony in 
her voice, &quot;but I think I misunderstood why.&quot;

&quot;I tried to make you believe it was a political marriage,&quot; Ryouko 
said, &quot;but for me, I hoped it would be much more.&quot; She looked sideways 
at Ayeka to see how she was taking it.

Ayeka met Ryouko&#39;s gaze, her own expression just slightly bewildered. 
&quot;When I told Sasami about your proposal,&quot; Ayeka softly said, &quot;she 
wondered how you could have fallen in love with me so quickly. I guess 
that&#39;s my question, too.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t so sudden, for me,&quot; Ryouko smiled. &quot;I think I began to fall 
for you at our very first meeting,&quot; she admitted softly.

&quot;What, on the battlefield?&quot; Ayeka said, a bit surprised.

&quot;Well, at least it fit&#39;s my reputation,&quot; Ryouko smiled, and Ayeka 
chuckled softly. &quot;I didn&#39;t even know who you were at the time,&quot; she 
said softly, &quot;all I knew was that you were so beautiful and terribly 
striking.&quot;

Ayeka blushed at the compliment, &quot;Is that why you saved my life?&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t let someone like you die, no,&quot; Ryouko admitted quietly, 
&quot;but we were separated, and I thought that was that, at least until I 
discovered who you were.&quot;

Ayeka digested that silently, as they reached her suite of rooms. She 
looked up at Ryouko, &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure about how I feel about you, 
but I think I&#39;d like to get to know you better.&quot; She took a breath, 
&quot;But in the meantime, I&#39;m willing to go through with the political 
marriage.&quot;

Ryouko looked honestly startled at that, &quot;What?&quot;

Ayeka felt a bit of satisfaction at surprising the young woman. &quot;Your 
mother told you there would be trouble between Manticore and Jurai, 
and I think she&#39;s right. We need to do something to symbolize the 
joining of our two peoples, and I think a marriage could do it.&quot;

Ryouko looked like she was about a step behind as she quietly said, 
&quot;You don&#39;t mind getting married before we get to know each other?&quot;

Ayeka nodded patiently, surpressing a smile.

Ryouko smiled, shaking her head. &quot;I think I have a lot to learn about 
Jurai,&quot; she sighed. &quot;When would you like to... ?&quot; she asked.

&quot;As soon as possible, I&#39;d think,&quot; Ayeka smiled.

&quot;My lady commands, so shall it be,&quot; Ryouko said, executing a formal 
bow. She took Ayeka&#39;s hand and kissed it gently.

Ayeka blushed. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to tell my mothers,&quot; she chuckled.

&quot;Washu will be quite amused,&quot; Ryouko laughed. She paused, &quot;Could we 
meet for lunch?&quot;

Ayeka keyed her door open, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; She hesitated, then gently 
kissed the surprised Ryouko on the cheek. &quot;See you at lunch,&quot; and the 
door closed behind her.

Ryouko stood for a moment, then she literally flew down the hallway, 
startling a few passerby with a loud shout of, &quot;Yes!&quot;



Masaki and Funaho gazed at their daughter in disbelief. &quot;You&#39;re 
getting married?&quot; Masaki finally managed to ask, her twin light blue 
ponytails bobbing in her surprise.

Funaho seemed calmer, outwardly, but she also showed the surprise in 
her eyes. &quot;You might have discussed it with us, first,&quot; the dark hared 
woman chided her gently.

Ayeka raised an single eyebrow and smiled as she said, &quot;Sorry, 
mothers, but it was the heat of the moment. Besides, the agreement 
between Jurai and Manticore will benefit both sides.&quot;

Masaki squealed happily and hit Ayeka with a choking hug, &quot;I&#39;m so 
happy for you!&quot;

Funaho was looking at her daughter thoughtfully. &quot;So is this a 
political marriage?&quot; she asked Ayeka quietly.

&quot;Not... entirely,&quot; Ayeka admitted, even as she worked her way free of 
Masaki&#39;s death grip.

&quot;When will the wedding be?&quot; Funaho inquired, still trying to fully 
take in the situation.

&quot;As soon as possible,&quot; Ayeka shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t want to give any 
resistance to Ryouko on Jurai a chance to build,&quot; she explained.

&quot;But what about the bridal parties?&quot; Masaki suddenly asked tearfully. 
&quot;And we need to make it a fitting wedding for both of them!&quot; she 
exclaimed.

Funaho was nodding thoughtfully, &quot;She has a point.&quot; She turned to 
Ayeka, &quot;Does Ryouko have any of her family on board ship?&quot;

Before Ayeka could answer, the communicator in her mother&#39;s suite 
chimed. &quot;I&#39;ll get it,&quot; Masaki said cheerfully. &quot;Hello?&quot; she asked.

Washu&#39;s image appeared on the screen. &quot;Have you heard about this 
wedding?&quot; she demanded. &quot;There&#39;s almost no time to hold any good 
parties,&quot; she frowned.

&#39;What&#39;s with the parties?&#39; Ayeka found herself wondering.

&quot;We&#39;ll need to get together and start planning the wedding,&quot; Funaho 
stepped up to speak with Washu next.

&quot;I&#39;ll be over in five intervals,&quot; Washu vowed, &quot;and I&#39;ll bring along 
the delinquent&#39;s little sister, Minagi, too.&quot;

&quot;See you then,&quot; Masaki said cheerfully.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll just go for a walk,&quot; Ayeka sighed. She didn&#39;t want to 
think about the kind of trouble that Washu, Funaho and Masaki could 
get into. She opened the door, then sighed as she waved Washu and 
Minagi in, &quot;That was fast.&quot;

&quot;You better take off a bit while we start planning,&quot; Washu grinned 
while rubbing her hands together eagerly.

Minagi was smiling and shaking her head. &quot;I&#39;ll try to hold them back 
from anything too outrageous,&quot; she promised Ayeka softly.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Ayeka whispered back, and headed out as quickly as 
possible.



Ayeka entered the dining hall, looking around her curiously. The 
tables were packed for lunch, people literally lined up to be fed. 
&#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39; she wondered, then she saw something that answered 
that question.

Sasami was manning the counter, and just from looking at it Ayeka 
could tell the food was one of her sister&#39;s creations. Considering the 
food before now, the crew probably viewed Sasami&#39;s coming as a gift 
from god.

&quot;Big sister Ayeka,&quot; Sasami piped up happily. &quot;Ryouko&#39;s waiting for you 
in back,&quot; she pointed towards the door leading to the captain&#39;s table.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ayeka smiled, getting close to where Sasami stood. Quietly, 
Ayeka whispered her news in Sasami&#39;s ear.

&quot;You&#39;re getting married?&quot; Sasami blurted out loudly enough for all the 
diners to hear.

There was a moment of silence, then a cheer rang out across the hall. 
&#39;Obviously,&#39; Ayeka noted, &#39;Ryouko&#39;s campain to win my favors wasn&#39;t 
all that secret.&#39; She quickly made her way down the corridor to the 
captain&#39;s table.

Ryouko stood up from the table and smiled at her. &quot;What was that?&quot; she 
asked, nodding out towards the dining hall.

&quot;I think our impending marriage isn&#39;t particularly secret, anymore,&quot; 
Ayeka smiled.

&quot;Good,&quot; Ryouko answered, &quot;I want everyone to know I&#39;m marrying such a 
beautiful lady.&quot;

Ayeka blushed fiercely. </pre>
