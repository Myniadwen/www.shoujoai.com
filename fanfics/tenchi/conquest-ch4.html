<h1>Conquest (part 4 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The sleek, silver ship smoothly decelerated as it entered Jurai&#39;s 
solar system, maneuvering until it reached the planet of Jurai itself. 
A carefully executed docking was achieved with the much more massive 
Manticore flagship, the Washu&#39;s Revenge.

&quot;We cooperated with this ship during the Kagoto campaign,&quot; one Galaxy 
Police officer said quietly to the young woman leading the way between 
the two vessels. She was a good looking if rather intense red-head, 
and her expression was deeply troubled.

&quot;Does anyone know,&quot; she asked the other officers quietly, carefully 
making her way along the docking tube, &quot;if Kiyone is still affiliated 
with Manticore&#39;s forces?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Mitsuki,&quot; the sandy hared young man admitted to her 
softly.

They all reached the connecting hatch at last, and then had to wait a 
moment for it to open up. A soft hiss, then the pressures inside and 
outside equalized enough for the hatch to open. The GP officers tensed 
a bit, seeing who was waiting there.

&quot;Welcome aboard the Washu&#39;s Revenge,&quot; Kiyone said to them with a 
pleasant if slightly dangerous smile on her face, &quot;I&#39;m her captain, 
Kiyone.&quot;

The redhead threw her a salute, &quot;Galaxy Police Officer Mitsuki.&quot; 
Kiyone gave no sign of recognizing her, just a friendly nod. Her smile 
widened as a final figure came aboard, a tall, blond hared man of 
great stature and authority.

&quot;Well, hello Marshal,&quot; Kiyone smiled at the leader of the entire 
Galaxy Police, &quot;It&#39;s been a while. Back at my court marshal, I think.&quot;

He nodded to her gravely, &quot;It&#39;s...&quot; he paused, and then he forced 
himself to say, &quot;good to see you once again.&quot;

&quot;Follow me,&quot; Kiyone said briskly, &quot;I&#39;ll lead you to the conference 
room where the Queen is waiting for you.&quot;

Ryouko smiled grimly as the door opened and the Galaxy Police 
delegation was led inside. Kiyone was as deadpan as always, but it was 
obvious that she was enjoying this. The Marshal looked glum, knowing 
that he was at a severe disadvantage. The rest of the GP looked 
nervous, except for the red-head, who kept a wary eye on Kiyone.

Ryouko rose, &quot;Take a seat, please. We have much to discuss.&quot;

Kiyone went over to Ryouko, taking a seat just beside her.

The Marshal stiffened visibly. &quot;Does she have to be here?&quot; he asked 
Ryouko with a bit of anger in his voice.

Ryouko&#39;s eyes narrowed, but she spoke mildly in reply, &quot;Kiyone is the 
senior Captain of the fleet, as well as one of my most trusted 
advisors.&quot; With a dangerous look in her eye she said much more 
seriously, &quot;She stays.&quot;

&#39;This is not going very well at all,&#39; Mitsuki thought to herself 
grimly. Trying to save what she could from the situation she said, 
&quot;Thank you for the invitation, Queen Ryouko. I&#39;m certain that the GP 
can be a great help to you.&quot;

&quot;I do hope so,&quot; Ryouko said to them as her voice dropped to a 
frightening purr in the silence of the conference room.

The Marshal and Mitsuki exchanged a worried glance. &quot;Your message 
didn&#39;t mention an agenda for this meeting,&quot; the Marshal ventured to 
say.

Ryouko got up, walking over to take a look out one of the viewports, 
as well as to make them wait a bit. &quot;My agenda is relatively simple,&quot; 
she finally said to them coolly, &quot;I would like to authorize the Galaxy 
Police to operate throughout the Republic of Manticore, including the 
territories that had formally belonged to Jurai.&quot;

Almost everyone on the Galaxy Police&#39;s side of the long meeting table 
breathed a loud sigh of relief. Mitsuki, however, still looked rather 
nervous, a concern that was quickly justified by Ryouko&#39;s next few 
words.

&quot;Sadly, I can&#39;t do that just yet,&quot; Ryouko said regretfully. &quot;You see, 
I&#39;m very concerned with how the GP participated in Jurai&#39;s war with 
Manticore, as well as operating as a extension of the Emperor&#39;s own 
secret police.&quot;

The Marshal stiffened visibly. &quot;We were only operating as a police 
force during time of war,&quot; he said to her quite firmly.

Ryouko raised her eyebrow, &quot;I distinctly remember seeing GP ships 
actively fighting against the Manticore line of vessels.&quot; She shook 
her head, &quot;But that is in the past. I am willing to finance the GP, as 
well as provide you with a charter guaranteeing your independence from 
my government. You&#39;ll be free to pursue criminals even within 
government bodies.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the catch?&quot; Mitsuki asked her flatly. There was no way that 
Ryouko was offering them such a wonderful deal without strings 
attached.

Ryouko gave her a short but respectful nod, &quot;Before I do this, I want 
the GP to clean house first. All those officers who obeyed illegal 
orders in the war with Manticore or before hand, must face justice for 
their actions.&quot;

&quot;But, they thought they were obeying the requests of a justified 
civilian government,&quot; the Marshal protested that loudly.

&quot;I was just following orders, is not an acceptable excuse,&quot; Ryouko 
said to him grimly, &quot;They should have refused such orders outright.&quot;

Mitsuki spoke up firmly, &quot;If we do this,&quot; she said, putting all the 
force behind the first word, &quot;can we expel the officers dishonorably, 
stripping them of their benefits and pension, rather than having them 
face prison sentences?&quot;

Ryouko looked sideways at Kiyone, who gave her a small nod yes. &quot;That 
might just be acceptable,&quot; Ryouko said softly.



Ayeka curled up on her bed, still fully dressed for last night&#39;s 
interrupted dinner. Her thoughts raced, bouncing around wildly from 
one thing to another, unable to settle down at all. Giving up on 
resting, she sat up on the side of the bed, glaring blankly at the 
wall. Suddenly, she was startled by a soft rustling noise coming from 
one corner of the room.

Ayeka looked around her for anything she could use as a weapon, when 
she heard a soft cry of, &quot;Myah?&quot; A small, brown colored creature 
timidly hopped into her line of sight, looking up at her curiously. It 
was certainly an odd looking animal, a mix of the front half of a cat, 
but the back and the ear size of a rabbit.

&quot;How did you get in here?&quot; she asked it, surprised.

&quot;Myah!&quot; the little creature cheerfully chirped, and then it bounced up 
on to the bed beside her, rubbing against her leg happily.

&quot;What a silly little thing,&quot; Ayeka chuckled, reaching down to scratch 
between it&#39;s massive cat&#39;s ears. The little cabbit purred happily in 
reply.

&quot;What am I going to do?&quot; Ayeka softly asked it, gently drawing the 
cabbit into her lap. She petted it absentmindedly, smiling down at it 
fondly. &quot;I think I&#39;m starting to like her,&quot; Ayeka admitted, thinking 
of Ryouko almost fondly.

The little cabbit looked up at her before giving forth another, 
&quot;Myah?&quot; To Ayeka, it was almost as if it was actually asking her, 
&quot;Why?&quot;

Ayeka chuckled softly at her own imagination running away with her. 
&quot;Ryouko&#39;s strong,&quot; and the little cabbit paid special attention to 
that name, &quot;capable and confident. But she&#39;s also kind, and she really 
seems to care about her people.&quot;

&quot;Myah,&quot; it sounded like the cabbit agreed with that.

&quot;I just wish that I understood why she&#39;s so interested in me,&quot; Ayeka 
said to herself with a soft little sigh.

The little creature jumped down, looking up at her entreatingly. Then 
it ran right through the closed door! Ayeka looked on in surprise, and 
then it popped it&#39;s head back through the door. &quot;Myah!&quot; it firmly 
commanded her, then moved back outside.

Ayeka got up and opened up the door, seeing the little cabbit bouncing 
down the corridor. It stopped at an intersection, pointed down one 
pathway with one of it&#39;s expressively big ears, then bounded off that 
way.

&quot;Oh, well,&quot; Ayeka said with a bemused smile, &quot;it&#39;s not like I had 
anything better to do.&quot; She followed it down a twisting pathway of 
hallways, eventually reaching the engineering section. Finally, it 
passed through an unmarked door and disappeared.

Ayeka hesitated for a moment, looking at the door thoughtfully. She 
activated the chime, and heard a female voice cry out to her, &quot;Come 
in.&quot; The door opened up, Ayeka stepped inside, and then she stopped 
cold.

The chamber she entered was massive, stretching impossibly far into 
the distance. Machinery of many types was scattered all around, much 
of it completely foreign to Ayeka. Impossibly large structures reached 
almost to the roof, while other, smaller but infinitely more complex 
devices floated in midair. And at the very center of all the chaos a 
young woman sat, working two softly glowing keyboards at the same 
time.

&quot;Myah!&quot; the cabbit declared proudly.

&quot;So you&#39;ve made a new friend, Ryo-ohki?&quot; the red-head asked the cabbit 
curiously. She was tiny, but still seemed to be a mature adult, as 
well.

&quot;It looks like it,&quot; Ayeka chuckled, &quot;though I&#39;m not sure why Ryo-ohki 
led me here.&quot;

&quot;And you are?&quot; the woman asked.

Ayeka blushed, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m Ayeka.&quot;

The woman stopped, an odd look on her face as she quietly said, &quot;Of 
course you are.&quot; She smiled at Ayeka wryly, &quot;My name is Washu.&quot; She 
chuckled as she added, &quot;And I believe you&#39;re here to ask about 
Ryouko.&quot;

&quot;How did you know?&quot; Ayeka asked her, surprised.

Washu just smiled at her mysteriously.



Kiyone accompanied the Galaxy Police officers back to the access port, 
and watched silently as they began to disembark. Once most of them 
were gone she placed a gentle hand on the Marshal&#39;s shoulder, stopping 
him. He looked over at her questioningly.

&quot;I&#39;m sure Mihoshi would like to see you,&quot; Kiyone said to him softly. 
The older man looked torn a moment, then he finally nodded. Kiyone 
raised her communicator, &quot;Mihoshi to airlock ten, please, airlock 
ten.&quot;

Not long after, Mihoshi walked up to the airlock, and stopped cold, 
staring at the Marshal. Then, she cried out &quot;Daddy!&quot; and hit him with 
a flying hug.

Kiyone noticed Mitsuki standing nearby, and tilted her head towards an 
empty corridor as she said, &quot;Let&#39;s give them some privacy, shall we?&quot;

Kiyone led Mitsuki down the hall a short distance, just far enough 
away not to hear all of Mihoshi&#39;s squeals of joy. &quot;That was a very 
nice thing you did for him, back there,&quot; Mitsuki said to her softly, 
an odd look on her face.

&quot;I didn&#39;t do it for him,&quot; Kiyone answered her quite coldly, &quot;Mihoshi 
would have been so hurt knowing that he had been here and didn&#39;t want 
to see her.&quot; That killed the conversation for a bit. The redhead 
looked deeply uncomfortable, unsure what to say to her. &quot;Did you get 
that promotion you wanted,&quot; Kiyone asked softly, &quot;after you sold me 
out?&quot;

Mitsuki visibly winced at that. &quot;I didn&#39;t sell you out,&quot; she 
protested, &quot;but I had no choice about testifying against you, 
partner!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that!&quot; Kiyone bit out at her angrily. &quot;You have no 
right,&quot; she said much more quietly. &quot;You didn&#39;t say one word about the 
good we did,&quot; she said bitterly, &quot;just that I had knowingly assisted 
Galaxy Police&#39;s number one enemy Ryouko.&quot;

Mitsuki turned away from Kiyone&#39;s piercing gaze, knowing that she 
couldn&#39;t argue with what she said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; was all that she could 
find to say. A moment of silence, and then she asked, &quot;I suppose you 
wouldn&#39;t consider joining Galaxy Police again?&quot;

Kiyone looked at her in pure disbelief, &quot;You have got to be kidding 
me.&quot;

Mitsuki shook her head, &quot;I know more than a few officers who were 
outraged about your court marshal. If you want your job back, it&#39;s 
yours.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kiyone said softly, shaking her head. &quot;After all I&#39;ve seen, I&#39;m 
not quite as starry-eyed about the GP as I used to be. Besides,&quot; she 
added with a honest smile, &quot;I can do more real good right where I am.&quot;

Before Mitsuki could try to argue her out of it, Mihoshi bounded down 
the hallway towards them. &quot;Thank you, Kiyone!&quot; she squealed happily, 
laying a thorough kiss on the surprised Kiyone. Then she was gone down 
the hall, back to work.

Mitsuki watched her go, her own face remarkably pale. &#39;I guess I&#39;ve 
lost her for good,&#39; she mourned, seeing the honest happiness on 
Kiyone&#39;s face. &quot;I&#39;d better go see if the Marshal&#39;s ready to go,&quot; 
Mitsuki said abruptly.

Kiyone looked over at her a bit oddly, but nodded her agreement. She 
smiled as she saw the goofy look on the older man&#39;s face, but 
otherwise she didn&#39;t remark on it. &quot;Good voyage to you,&quot; Kiyone wished 
them well, offering a salute as they climbed out the hatch. Both GP 
officers returned it gravely, and then they were gone.

&quot;That Kiyone&#39;s not so bad,&quot; the Marshal said softly.

Mitsuki smiled sadly, &quot;No, she&#39;s not.&quot; She looked over at him 
seriously, &quot;The changes Ryouko wants made will mean a major shakeup in 
the GP.&quot;

&quot;But I suspect we&#39;ll be the better for it,&quot; the Marshal admitted. 
&quot;Things went from bad to worse under them Emperor of Jurai,&quot; he said 
softly, &quot;let&#39;s hope that things improve under the Queen of Manticore.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll improve,&quot; Mitsuki vowed softly, Kiyone&#39;s face in the 
forefront of her thoughts, &quot;even if we have to push every change 
ourselves.&quot;



&quot;...and that&#39;s what happened.&quot; Ayeka felt good having told the whole 
tale to someone. It was strange, but it was very easy to confide in 
the small scientist. She had a almost motherly aura about her, 
inviting such confidences.

&quot;Ryouko is impetuous,&quot; Washu sighed, &quot;as you no doubt know.&quot; Ayeka 
chuckled at that, so Washu continued, &quot;But her instincts are usually 
right.&quot;

Ayeka blushed faintly. &quot;I like her,&quot; she admitted, &quot;and I find myself 
feeling strangely around her, as if I want to do... something, but 
what I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a good place to start,&quot; Washu said gently. Before she could 
say anything more, the door chimed softly. &quot;Just when it was getting 
good,&quot; she grumbled, then more loudly, &quot;Come in!&quot;

Ryouko walked in, &quot;Washu, I have to ask you something,&quot; and then she 
froze, staring. &quot;Ayeka?&quot; she gasped, and a blush stole across her 
features.

&quot;Ryouko,&quot; Ayeka said, blushing as well. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was just asking 
Miss Washu for advice, I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to anything she says!&quot; Ryouko blurted out.

&quot;What, you don&#39;t think your mother can give good advice?&quot; Washu 
protested.

&quot;Myah!&quot; Ryo-ohki piped up.

&quot;Mother?&quot; Ayeka echoed her faintly.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m this overgrown juvenile delinquent&#39;s mother,&quot; Washu 
admitted, bringing a snort of laughter from Ayeka.

Ryouko glared at Washu, &quot;Mom!&quot; She took a deep breath, collecting 
herself, then more quietly, &quot;Ayeka?&quot; When she turned to Ryouko, she 
continued, &quot;I&#39;m very sorry about what I did last night. I got carried 
away by the moment, and didn&#39;t consider your feelings.&quot;

&quot;Apology accepted,&quot; Ayeka said softly, walking over to where Ryouko 
was standing. After a moment to collect her courage, Ayeka asked, &quot;Do 
you think we could go talk about it?&quot;

Ryouko looked at her in surprise, then she smiled. &quot;I&#39;d be glad to,&quot; 
she said, and tentatively took Ayeka&#39;s hand. They left quietly, hand 
in hand.

&quot;Kawaii,&quot; Washu sighed softly, watching them leave.

&quot;Myah,&quot; Ryo-ohki agreed. </pre>
