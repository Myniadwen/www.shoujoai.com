<h1>No Need for Dreaming</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It&#39;s afternoon, and the house sitting nearby the shrine was quiet. 
There were no explosions going off, no fighting, space ships weren&#39;t 
crashing into the nearby lake, and there were no alien tyrants 
attempting to take over the world that day. All was quiet, something 
that happened in this particular location very, very rarely. And the 
dark hared young woman in a bikini resting out on the lawn intended to 
enjoy it while it lasted!

Kiyone sighed happily, laying back on the lounge chair out in the 
middle of the Moritato front yard. She had already developed a very 
nice all-over suntan, she had a glass of cold ice tea waiting for her 
to get thirsty by her side, and she had enjoyed nearly a total week 
without having to put up with Mihoshi&#39;s presence!

&#39;Washu,&#39; Kiyone thought with a blissful smile on her face, &#39;I don&#39;t 
know how in the world you did it, but thank you so much! Who would 
have thought saving that crazy scientist&#39;s life would pay off for me 
so well?&#39;

A slightly impish smile crossed her face as she remembered what 
happened two weeks ago: Washu had suddenly disappeared from her lab, 
and while most of them breathed a sigh of relief that she was gone, 
only Lady Ayeka had to be the party pooper.

She had pushed her purple hair back and adjusted her formal robes, 
then she delivered the bad news. &quot;Lord Tenchi,&quot; Ayeka had said in her 
particularly self-righteous tones, &quot;despite being away in the city 
taking exams, would be very upset if we didn&#39;t at least try to find 
out what happened to her.&quot; Ryouko and Mihoshi had quickly fallen into 
line, and Kiyone figured she also had to tag along, if only to try to 
keep the others out of trouble.

A search of the main lab revealed evidence that Washu had been 
teleported out of the lab, and they detected enough of an energy trail 
to trace it back to her kidnapper&#39;s home base. Ryo-Oh-ki had a cold 
and therefore wasn&#39;t sensitive enough to follow the track, but their 
Galaxy Police cruiser was able to. The asteroid they finally 
discovered several solar systems away had been hollowed out and 
reinforced into a veritable fortress, and they quickly devised a plan. 
Ryouko and Ayeka launched a headlong attack on the main entrance while 
the two Galaxy Police officers snuck into the back of the base.

Ryouko led the charge, her long blue-gray hair swinging behind her as 
she threw energy bolts with one hand and swung her energy blade with 
the other! Ayeka followed closely, her normal robes exchanged for 
lighter garb as she threw electrical bolts against the enemy forces as 
eagerly as her companion!

To the distant sounds of a violent battle Kiyone and Mihoshi broke in 
as quietly as possible. Kiyone groaned softly as Mihoshi tripped 
climbing out of the air duct, her golden hair flying and tears 
appearing in her blue eyes. &quot;Shhh!&quot; Kiyone cautioned her, taking her 
darker skinned hand and pulling her to her feet.

Mihoshi nodded silently, still a bit teary eyed. They traced Washu&#39;s 
trail deeper and deeper into the structure until they came upon a 
massive lab similar to Washu&#39;s own base. They cautiously made their 
way in only to suddenly come across a most unusual sight! Washu was 
suspended from the ceiling by a length of old fashioned cable over a 
vat of rapidly boiling oil, a most vexed expression on her face! &quot;Get 
me down!&quot; Washu said to them impatiently.

Kiyone quickly pushed the vat aside them Mihoshi cut Washu down, but 
she wasn&#39;t quite fast enough to catch the child-like scientist before 
Washu hit the ground face first. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Mihoshi said kawaiily.

&quot;What did you do to make him so angry?&quot; Kiyone asked Washu curiously 
as she helped her to her feet.

&quot;We were exchanging letters,&quot; Washu explained as they quickly retraced 
Kiyone&#39;s and Mihoshi&#39;s path back out of the building, &quot;and Dr, Rotwang 
grew very upset when I criticized his work on humanoid robotics!&quot; She 
shook her head at the foolishness of the other scientist, her red hair 
standing up more than usual from her ill treatment.

Kiyone sweatdropped and instead concentrated on getting them all 
safely out of the building. The three then quickly rounded up the 
slightly messed up pair of Ayeka and Ryouko and made it back to their 
waiting ship.

&quot;Mi..ho..shi...&quot; Kiyone growled angrily to herself once she saw it. 
Mihoshi had parked the ship so one of the landing struts had fallen 
into a previously hidden crater, leaving the ship resting there on an 
odd angle, unable to launch.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Kiyone,&quot; Mihoshi said to her quietly, while Kiyone fumed.

Washu looked up at the angry Kiyone with an intrigued look on her 
face. &quot;You know, the group of you may have saved my life. Is there 
anything I can do to repay you?&quot; Washu asked her thoughtfully.

&quot;Some time without Mihoshi would be a good start,&quot; Kiyone angrily bit 
out, and moved over to the others to try and straighten out the ship 
for launch.

&quot;Kiyone, do you know where Mihoshi is?&quot; a concerned voice asked behind 
her, bringing her back to the present. Kiyone turned in her seat, and 
saw a worried looking Ayeka standing there. She looked awfully 
uncomfortable under the hot sun in her kimono, but Kiyone was in too 
good a mood to let it bother her. Not too much, anyway.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, and I really don&#39;t care,&quot; Kiyone answered her 
cheerfully, and turned back over to enjoy the sun. She could almost 
feel Ayeka standing there behind her, radiating pure disappointment.

&quot;But Mihoshi&#39;s your partner, it&#39;s your duty to help her,&quot; Ayeka said 
to Kiyone with a expression of disapproval. &quot;She could be in trouble,&quot; 
she said worriedly.

&quot;Firstly, I didn&#39;t choose her as a partner, she was assigned to me. 
Secondly, she&#39;s probably the luckiest person I&#39;ve ever met. I&#39;m 
certain she&#39;ll be perfectly fine, though I pity any innocent 
bystanders standing nearby,&quot; Kiyone answered her calmly.

&quot;Kiyone, even if that space pirate trash Ryouko was in trouble, I&#39;d 
care about it.&quot; Ayeka said to her in a cold fury. &quot;Mihoshi has been a 
good friend to you, and I cannot believe you don&#39;t feel any concern. 
You&#39;re contemptible!&quot; Ayeka exclaimed, and stalked away angrily.

Kiyone lay back to try to enjoy the sun, but her heart really wasn&#39;t 
in it anymore. She began to wonder what Washu had done to Mihoshi to 
give Kiyone her vacation, and her conscience started to bother her. 
Finally, with a heavy sigh, she got up, got dressed, and went over to 
see Washu.

&quot;What do you mean, she&#39;s gone forever!?&quot; Kiyone yelled in disbelief as 
she picked up the diminutive scientist and bodily shook her. 
Strangely, Washu didn&#39;t loose her perplexed expression even as Kiyone 
shook her back and forth.

&quot;But I thought you&#39;d be happy to see her gone,&quot; Washu said with a 
confused frown. &quot;You always go on and on about what a pain she is, and 
how happy you&#39;d be if she was gone, so I did what you asked,&quot; Washu 
shrugged expressively.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that!&quot; Kiyone said, but it was hard for her to 
stay angry when she felt so guilty. She had said that, over and over 
again. &#39;And I wonder how many times has Mihoshi heard that,&#39; she 
thought with a fresh surge of guilt.

&quot;What, exactly, did you do?&quot; Kiyone asked Washu softly, and found 
herself dreading the answer. Washu may have been the greatest 
scientist in this galaxy (a chibi-Washu suddenly pops up, loudly 
declaring &quot;Universe!&quot;), but she was also very likely certifiably 
insane. There was no telling what she could have done.

&quot;Do you remember the dinner Mihoshi didn&#39;t show up for a few days 
ago?&quot; Washu asked with a sinister smile on her pretty face.

Kiyone suddenly turned green, and wondered where you could get a 
turbo-powered stomach pump on very short notice.

&quot;Well, I took Mihoshi over to my lab before then, and showed her my 
latest variation on my incredible Time and Space Device!&quot; Kiyone 
sighed in relief, though Washu didn&#39;t notice it as she continued, 
&quot;Instead of using a primitive keyboard to input the data, it reads 
your mind directly and creates a world based on your deepest wants and 
desires!&quot;

&quot;So all I have to do is bring Mihoshi back from her fantasy world,&quot; 
Kiyone said, sounding relieved. &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound too hard.&quot; she 
said hopefully

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple,&quot; Washu said. &quot;To bring her out of it, you 
would have to get her to reject the world that is everything she&#39;s 
ever wanted. That&#39;s why I said she&#39;s gone forever, I can&#39;t see anyone 
rejecting their own personally made paradise.&quot;

&quot;Oh, hell,&quot; Kiyone sighed softly.

&quot;I set up a monitor,&quot; Washu said, walking over to a nearby computer 
screen, &quot;to make sure everything was all right in Mihoshi&#39;s world. 
Let&#39;s take a peek, shall we?&quot;

Adjusting a few controls she brought up a image of Mihoshi and what 
looked like Kiyone on the small screen in front of her, then 
transferred it to a larger one in the center of the room. Apparently, 
they were receiving a briefing from the chief of Galaxy Police. The 
two stood together closely, and Kiyone was surprised to see the blush 
of happiness on Mihoshi&#39;s pretty face.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry sir,&quot; Mihoshi said firmly, &quot;we&#39;ll handle it!&quot;

Out in the hallway, the other Kiyone said to Mihoshi fondly, &quot;You 
shouldn&#39;t be so quick to make that promise. This is a big case, and it 
could be very hard for us to solve.&quot;

Mihoshi waved her hand in the air, smiling &quot;We can handle it. We are 
the very best pair of officers Galaxy Police has, you know. Besides,&quot; 
she said to her with a sly grin, &quot;I seem to remember you offering me 
one of your &#39;special rewards&#39; for cracking our next case, love!&quot;

The other Kiyone blushed brightly as she remarked &quot;You would remember 
that.&quot; Mihoshi took her arm and they hurried down the hallway together 
laughing.

Things became a blur on the computer screen, and in what seemed like 
moments, a beat up but proud looking Mihoshi and Kiyone brought in the 
arch- criminal Kagato. They booked him, and things blurred again, 
finally returning to a small but comfortable apartment.

Kiyone and Mihoshi ate a romantic diner together, lit by soft 
candlelight, then they were soon standing facing each other in the 
dark bedroom nearby, slowly undressing each other. Mihoshi took the 
lead, gently pressing Kiyone down on the bed and kissing her fiercely. 
The real Kiyone heard Mihoshi say to her other self in a voice full of 
emotion &quot;I love you,&quot; even as she reached over and shut the computer 
screen off.

Washu looked at Kiyone sympathetically as Kiyone sank down into one of 
the floating chairs and put her head in her hands. After a few silent 
minutes Kiyone softly murmured &quot;I didn&#39;t know she loved me.&quot;

&quot;Then you were blind,&quot; Washu said to her surprisingly gently. Washu 
continued softly &quot;I think she&#39;s happy there, Kiyone. She&#39;s successful, 
well off, winning all the time, and she has a life with the woman she 
loves,&quot; Washu said softly. &quot;What can you offer her to bring her back?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Kiyone stopped, and looked into the distance. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; 
she said softly and sadly. She got up suddenly and paced across the 
room, tormented by memories of her partner. Mihoshi was flighty, 
clumsy, airheaded, irritating and... Kiyone sighed to herself softly. 
She left that train of thought behind her because it didn&#39;t really 
matter. Mihoshi&#39;s good qualities far outweighed the bad ones, at least 
for Kiyone. Good hearted, kind and fiercely loyal, Mihoshi wore her 
heart on her sleeve for all the world to see.

Unlike herself, Kiyone realized. She had always kept others at a 
distance with her crabbiness and businesslike exterior. She focused on 
her work and her duties, not letting other things sway her, and not 
listening to anything her heart might be trying to say to her. She 
could hear her heart talking to her now, though, loud and clear.

There were a few tears in Kiyone&#39;s eyes as she returned to Washu&#39;s 
side and softly said &quot;There is something I can offer her, Washu.&quot; She 
took a deep breath, steeling herself, and said &quot;I love Mihoshi, Washu. 
And I don&#39;t want to loose her, no matter how crazy she may drive me at 
times.&quot; She got up and looked Washu in the eye, her face showing her 
determination, &quot;Get me into her world, Washu. Whatever it takes,&quot; she 
vowed intensely, &quot;I&#39;m bringing her home.&quot;

Washu smiled slowly in satisfaction and with a firm nod of her head 
she said, &quot;I lied.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Kiyone yelled, picked up Washu and went back to shaking her 
like a rag doll.

&quot;Mihoshi is asleep in a chamber just off the main lab,&quot; Washu said to 
Kiyone gently. &quot;That,&quot; she said, pointing over at the computer screen, 
&quot;is a dream monitor, only.&quot;

&quot;What the hell are you up to?&quot; Kiyone growled dangerously.

&quot;I&#39;ve done you both a favor,&quot; Washu said to her serenely, &quot;to pay back 
the debt I owe.&quot; At Kiyone&#39;s blank expression, she elaborated &quot;I gave 
you and Mihoshi your vacations of choice, and I got you to admit your 
true feelings about Mihoshi to yourself,&quot; she finished.

Washu grinned remembering what Mihoshi had said to her when she asked 
her about a reward: &quot;I want to sleep for a week!&quot; It all came together 
very nicely.

She looked at her fingernails, a impish smile on her child-like face. 
&quot;Not too shabby for a few days work,&quot; Washu said cheerfully.

Ayeka stepped out from behind a nearby computer terminal, adding &quot;It 
certainly took you long enough. No Princess of Jurai would ever have 
taken so long to act! I can&#39;t believe I had to prod you to get you 
down here to save Mihoshi.&quot;

Ryouko followed her out and gently chided Ayeka, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t talk, 
Princess. Considering what happened between us, love, Kiyone is 
looking good.&quot; She smiled softly, adding &quot;That was a nice act outside, 
though. A little overdone, but...&quot;

&quot;It was not overdone,&quot; Ayeka said haughtily, and was about to continue 
when they noticed Kiyone&#39;s surprised expression.

&quot;You two are...&quot; Kiyone said to Ayeka and Ryouko with a certain amount 
of surprise in her voice. She shook her head, and got back on topic, 
asking Washu &quot;Mihoshi&#39;s all right, then?&quot; At Washu&#39;s nod, she sighed 
with relief.

&quot;So what are you going to do now?&quot; Washu asked her.

&quot;Where did you say Mihoshi is?&quot; Kiyone asked, ignoring the question. 
Washu gestured Kiyone to follow behind her, and led Kiyone out of the 
larger chamber and into a smaller bedroom nearby, where Mihoshi lay 
asleep.

A small device was attached to Mihoshi&#39;s temple, her shoulder length 
golden hair was spread across the pillow and she looked absolutely 
adorable to Kiyone, curled there into a little ball under the covers. 
Washu quietly left them there alone, and Kiyone walked over to 
Mihoshi&#39;s bedside, gazing down at her admiringly. &#39;She&#39;s beautiful,&#39; 
Kiyone thought, then wondered why it had taken her so long to see it.

&quot;Kiyone,&quot; Mihoshi said softly in her sleep. Kiyone reached down and 
gently shook Mihoshi, until the young woman&#39;s eyes opened and she 
blinked up at Kiyone drowsily. &quot;Am I still dreaming?&quot; Mihoshi asked 
her sleepily.

&quot;There&#39;s no need for dreaming,&quot; Kiyone said to her softly. Leaning 
over her, she smiled down at her warmly and gently kissed Mihoshi on 
the lips.

------------------------------------------------------------

A short little mini-fic for you Kiyone/Mihoshi fans out there! Set 
somewhere in the Tenchi Universe continuity (of course), as Kiyone is 
alive and kicking. Why isn&#39;t Tenchi in here? Well, they don&#39;t call it 
&#39;No Need for Tenchi&#39; for nothing, you know. Yes, I&#39;m a Ryouko/Ayeka 
fan, too, so they&#39;re together in this fic!

Why pair up Kiyone and Mihoshi? First of all I should say, I&#39;ve only 
seen the first four Tenchi Universe episodes, as well as the Time and 
Space Adventures tape, so I&#39;ll only be writing about those. I&#39;ve also 
seen the movies, but I&#39;m never quite sure where, or even if, those 
actually fit in to the Universe series! In the &#39;Time and Space&#39; 
storyline, the characters created a series of &#39;alternate&#39; worlds where 
their various wishes were granted.

Strangely, instead of asking for love, power or other rewards, Mihoshi 
asked that she and Kiyone be together forever! In each of the worlds 
they visited, Kiyone and Mihoshi were together: as guards, teachers, 
and police detectives. In the world Kiyone created for herself, 
Mihoshi appeared, having given up her job and career to find her! Even 
in the world where Mihoshi actually got to marry Tenchi, she seemed to 
be only somewhat happy, and discussed her many troubles with her long 
time best friend, Kiyone.

I do think Mihoshi, at least from the episodes I&#39;ve seen, is in love 
with Kiyone. Now how Kiyone feels about her is another matter, but I 
believe that under the annoyance she often shows, Kiyone does care for 
her partner. As far as the regular series goes, I don&#39;t see Kiyone 
ever telling Mihoshi &quot;I love you.&quot; on her own. That&#39;s why she&#39;s 
basically tricked into admitting it in this fic.

Our villain for the rescue sequence, Rotwang (for the astute reader) 
is visiting from the classic B&amp;W movie Metropolis. An expert in 
&quot;humanoid robotics&quot; indeed... </pre>
