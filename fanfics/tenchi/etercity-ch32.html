<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 32 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch31.html">Back to Part 31</a><pre>Makoto Kino smiled as the brown haired woman walked
the streets of Crystal Tokyo, her simple green summer
dress swirling around her legs. She could have taken a
bus or cab, of course, but being out in the sun like
this was remarkably enjoyable, especially when she was
going out into the city with a friend.

&#39;Now,&#39; Makoto thought to herself with some amusement,
&#39;if I could only convince my friends that we&#39;re just
friends.&#39;

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Taiki waved from where the redish brown
haired woman waited for her by the gate of the
Starlight&#39;s home. She looked nice in her dress pants
anf blouse, the swell of breasts and hips making it
very clear the subtlelly androgenous figure was
female.

&quot;I hope you we&#39;ren&#39;t waiting too long,&quot; Makoto smiled,
&quot;I wanted to shower after I finished my trainig
session with Erica.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re still training her to fight?&quot; Taiki asked as
they fell into step together, heading up the street
into town.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Makoto nodded, &quot;and she&#39;s getting pretty good,
too.&quot;

Taiki smiled, &quot;I&#39;m not surprised, considering who her
parents are.&quot;

&quot;So what do you want to do today?&quot; Makoto asked
curiously.

With an impish look Taiki chuckled, &quot;Surprse me.&quot; She
looked over at Makoto curiously, &quot;It occured to me
that I&#39;m being pretty rude taking up so much of your
time... am I taking you away from your duties?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; Makoto reassured him, &quot;as Lady Jupiter
my primary duty is being the representative of the
police and internal security forces, most of which
involves overseeing my very good deputies.&quot;

Taiki smiled as they walked together through a rain of
cherry blossoms, the delicate red tinted petals
falling down from the trees lining the road as a
breeze ruffled their hair. &quot;You sound like a very good
manager,&quot; Taiki admitted.

&quot;I try to be,&quot; Makoto said modestly. She chuckled as
she remembered, &quot;Back when we first helped found
Crystal Tokyo we all took a much more hands on
approach to running things... but now we try to let
the people control their own destiny.&quot;

&quot;Queen Kakyuu would probably agree,&quot; Taiki nodded.

It was oddly pleasant on the streets of the city, an
example of the politeness that was one of the
foundations of the society here. People recognized a
preformer like Taiki, of course, but the custom of
privacy caused the majority to keave them in peace,
only the occasional flash of a camera disturbing them.

&quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Makoto said as they came around a
corner, the old style structure of gleaming white
stone shining in the sunlight.

&quot;The Tokyo museum?&quot; Taiki recognized it, her voice
showing the excitement of a scholar finding a new toy.

&quot;Seiya mentioned you wanted to go but the others
overruled you,&quot; Makoto chuckled as they walked up the
sidewalk.

The great doors swung open silently as they neared the
building, the hall within lined with people looking at
exhibits and following tours. &quot;I know this sort of
thing isn&#39;t her or Yaten&#39;s style,&quot; she said as Makoto
lead her in, &quot;but I had to try.&quot;

&quot;You sound like Ami when she deals with us,&quot; Makoto
noted with some amusement, &quot;trying to bring us culture
and refinement even if it kills her.&quot;

&quot;I doubt you were ever that bad,&quot; Taiki said with
amusement.

Makoto actually blushed slightly, &quot;Thanks.&quot; Right near
the main entrance was a large, three dimensional map
of Crystal Tokyo, then beneath it images that could be
activated of each of the cities that had once stood in
it&#39;s place.

&quot;Fasinating,&quot; Taikli traced the path from Tokyo to
Tokyo-2, then the merger to the larger city of
Megatokyo. Centuries of building and destruction had
left only a Junkyard City at one point, before the
reformation and foundation of Crystal Tokyo itself.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it,&quot; Makoto agreed. &quot;Other than Arisugawa&#39;s
Locket not much of old Tokyo remains, though the
Palace itself is built on the location of Tokyo
Tower.&quot;

&quot;I remember seeing the Tower when we were on Earth the
first time,&quot; Taiki agreed. She looked thoughtful, &quot;I
heard the Tower was a focus point of unusual
energies?&quot;

&quot;Some very odd stuff happened around it,&quot; Makoto
agreed as they walked on, chatting comfortably.
&quot;Dimensional incursions, superhuman battles and even a
few of our Senshi battles,&quot; she revealed.

There was a display on old Tokyo with historic
landmarks, artifacts of the Corporate Wars, the Exodus
era where starships had fled chaos from Earth and
colonized the rest of the solar system and beyond. One
section even dealt with the shock that had hit the
archeological comunity when the ruins of the Moon
Kingdom and other artifacts of that era were
discovered.

Taiki looked at the map of the solar system
thoughtfully, &quot;So do you actually visit the palace you
have orbiting Jupiter?&quot;

&quot;I make a yearly pilgrimage,&quot; Makoto acknowledged,
&quot;but not much more than that.&quot; She frowned, &quot;Though
recently I&#39;ve had to take a more active interest.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Taiki asked as they walked by a display of
Juraian artifacts found on Earth.

Makoto smiled wryly, &quot;There&#39;s a project to build
orbital habitats around Jupiter, hopefully to mine
elemental gasses from it&#39;s atmosphere. Since it&#39;s my
territory more or less, I&#39;m keeping an eye on them.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense.&quot; Taiki said, stopping them at a larger
display near the rear of the building. &quot;Is this when
Sailor Moon took over?&quot; he waved towards the scene, a
reproduction of when Neo-Queen Serenity had signed
agreements with the surviving world governments
shortly before the founding of Crystal Tokyo.

Makoto laughed gently at how he described the event,
&quot;That&#39;s when she agreed to become queen, but she
didn&#39;t take over.&quot;

Taiki chuckled, &quot;Sorry, I haven&#39;t had much chance to
study your government.&quot;

&quot;Wish Ami was here, she could explain it better,&quot;
Makoto frowned.

Taiki reached out to put her hand on Makoto&#39;s bare
arm, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do fine.&quot;

Another faint blush touched Makoto&#39;s cheeks. &quot;What we
are is a variation on a constitutional monarchy,&quot; she
revealed, &quot;Serenity is queen but she&#39;s in part
governed by Parliment, who can veto her decisions and
hold power over budget and much of our policies.&quot;

&quot;Checks and ballances,&quot; Taiki noted.

&quot;Yes, Serenity refused to take the job of Queen unless
there were a great deal of limits on the power of the
office,&quot; Makoto agreed.

&quot;And the Senshi and your allies are...?&quot; Taiki asked.

&quot;Many of us are ministers in charge of various areas,&quot;
Makoto said, &quot;and there is a certain amount of
authority that goes with our reputations, too.&quot;

&quot;I know how that feels,&quot; Taiki cheerfully agreed, the
two moving back towards the front of the museum.

Makoto smiled over at her, &quot;So how&#39;s the negotiations
going with Serenity?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re probably going to have to summon Queen Kakyuu
soon,&quot; Taiki said cheerfully, &quot;to sign the treaties.&quot;

Makoto hesitated, unsure if she wanted to ask the next
question. &quot;Does that mean you&#39;ll be going home soon?&quot;
she asked.

&quot;Actually, no,&quot; Taiki said with a slight smile, &quot;Queen
Kakyuu wants one of we Starlights to remain as an
ambassador and I volunteered.&quot;

Makoto smiled in relief. &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; she said, her
voice barely a whisper.

They walked out of the museum, both blinking in the
bright sunlight. &quot;I was wondering,&quot; Taiki said as they
reached the building the Starlights were staying in,
&quot;would you like to go out to dinner with me later this
week?&quot;

Makoto looked at Taiki in surprise, a smile tugging at
the corner of her mouth, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;</pre>
