<h1>St Manga School (part 14 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/stmanga-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Kakashi and Lust were ready for another round of auditions. The 
standards were pretty set and they had seen some pretty unforgettable 
moments. The memory of Drew in female lingerie had still triggered in 
Kakashi&#39;s mind. He knew that Lust was very pleased with yesterday&#39;s 
auditions, especially the one where the lads all had lip-gloss on. So 
Kakashi was prepared to have something that seemed over the top or 
crazy. He was pleased with the dancing duo; Zoey and Dawn.

&quot;Okay, so we have Chizuru and Osaka.&quot; Lust announced as she waited for 
the two to arrive on stage. Osaka arrived on stage in a skimpy light 
green dress, with a guitar wrapped around her shoulder. She stepped 
towards the microphone as the red head; Chizuru stood center stage, in a 
very gloomy manner. &quot;Whenever you guys are ready.&quot; Lust reminded them. 
Osaka started fiddle with the strings of her guitar as Chizuru began 
dancing in a very sad manner.

&quot;Sweet young dyke,&quot; Osaka whispered into her microphone, &quot;expelled 
unfairly. Sympathy for the sweet dyke, treated cruelly.&quot; A sweet tune of 
sad piano music came into the atmosphere as Osaka continued to play with 
her guitar. The guitar was giving a tune, that made the audience feel, 
that they were more in a Wild West town. Chizuru sat down and hugged 
herself. &quot;This stunning woman has lost her wings.&quot; Osaka was starting to 
sing in a completely different tune. &quot;Is being gay, such a terrible 
thing?&quot; she asked, the fact that Osaka had a serious face on her with 
pretty unusual lyrics, Lust had no idea weather to laugh or cry. Some 
the students in the audience were chuckling with sheer laughter.

&quot;Maybe, she loves the tits,&quot; giggles of laughter were heard as Osaka 
continued to sing. She had now returned to the previous singing tone. 
Meanwhile, Kakashi&#39;s eyes had widened as he found that a certain word 
was not appropriate for the school show. &quot;Does it matter if her hobby is 
sucking clits?&quot; The laughter rapidly increased as the lyrics sounds was 
quite inappropriate for school. &quot;Open your hearts, open your minds. Be 
strong Chizuru and sing to the world.&quot;

The mood of the music then changed into something of a more jolly and 
happy mood as Chizuru took centre stage and squished Osaka. &quot;I&#39;m a 
lesbian, and I&#39;m proud of it,&quot; Chizuru squealed in tune. &quot;I&#39;m proud of 
being gay! Remember gay means happy, and I am very jolly. Because I&#39;m a 
les, a proper les! &quot; She was dancing around with Osaka as the raven 
haired girl allowed her to play with her.

&quot;She sure is s a lesbian!&quot; Osaka announced whilst being twirled around 
my Chizuru.

&quot;I haven&#39;t got a dildo,&quot; the red head pointed out in the high-pitched 
melody of her voice. &quot;But I&#39;m, proud to be lesbo, because I&#39;m proud, of 
who I am!&quot; She kissed Osaka&#39;s hand as she began dancing around the stage 
in her tip toes. &quot;I love the taste of their lip gloss, and the sizes 
they all come. I love girls with big ones, small ones, and medium ones 
of any size. I love girls in general.&quot;

&quot;Why do you love girls so much?&quot; Osaka asked as her fingers were 
connected to the strings of her joyful guitar.

&quot;I love my honeys because they&#39;re so pretty!&quot; Chizuru exclaimed as she 
twirled around Osaka.

She was silent as Chizuru circulated around her, she then froze. The 
pair of them froze, just when Kakashi and Lust thought that their 
audition was over, the sound of the guitar struck again. &quot;She&#39;s a 
lesbian. Yes she is, she&#39;s proud of being gay because gay also means 
happy. She&#39;s a lesbian, proper lesbian. She hasn&#39;t got a dildo, but 
she&#39;s proud to be a lesbo, hopefully her girlfriend will give her one 
for Christmas. Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s just a sweet young dyke.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a sweet young dyke!&quot; Chizuru was attempting a voice of a soprano, 
as her voice was very high pitched and sounded like she was attempting 
opera. &quot;I&#39;m a sweet young, joyful, happy, beautiful, amazing, hilarious, 
shocking great, powerful young dyke!&quot; Chizuru finished with a long note 
as Osaka fiddled with her guitar to finish with one little jingle. As 
soon as everything was silent, Osaka and Chizuru smiled as they 
performed a curtsy. Their performance seemed to have gone very6 well 
with the members of the audience watching. Well apart from Ichigo, who 
was one of Chizuru&#39;s friends. He gave a facial expression, which was a 
mixture of both shock and confusion.

Meanwhile, Mr Blackadder standing next to the door trying hard not to 
burst out laughing from the rather odd duet. Mr Baldric was standing 
right next to him in a smirk.

&quot;Mr B,&quot; Baldric whispered. &quot;I made all the students in my art class to 
create an image of you, whilst I browsed through some of the students 
social network accounts on his computer and I saved all the naughty 
ones.&quot;

&quot;Splendid job Baldric!&quot;

&quot;Also Jiraya has at least fifty other pornographic images on laptop,&quot; 
Baldric continued whispering to the acting deputy. &quot;If I see any more 
other rude images, I&#39;ll put them on his computer.&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t do anything stupid.&quot; Blackadder added, &quot;this is not the 
right place nor time to discuss such matters.&quot;

&quot;OK....&quot; Kakashi announced as soon as the applause had settled down. 
&quot;Next we have Yolei, Cody, Tomo, Yomi, Davis, Ken, Al, Edward and Tala. 
If you can guys can take yourselves to the stage and get yourselves 
ready in your own time.&quot;

There was dark music, which sounded very haunting, yet is was also very 
familiar. Yolei, Tomo, Yomi and Cody, Al and Ed entered the stage in 
line, whilst their faces were painted in a mixture of black and white. 
Their wigs were grey and their costumes were ripped and they all 
resembled zombies. Tomo left her mouth open as she crawled onto the 
stage with her arms crawling around Yomi&#39;s leg. Tala marched to the 
corner of the stage whilst playing his electric guitar. Tomo howled as 
her knees were rubbing against the floor causing them to hurt.

The tune was instantly recognised as Tomo got up onto her feet and 
starting marching like the rest of them were, in a circle stomping to 
the beat. Davis twirled to the stage wearing a red suit that looked very 
similar to the suit that Michael Jackson wore in his music video, 
Thriller; red shirt in the middle and the suit have a very shiny feeling 
to it with a texture that resembled leather. He did look very odd as he 
still had his goggles on his head for some particular reason. When Davis 
was centre stage, he clicked his fingers and twirled. &quot;It&#39;s close to 
midnight,&quot; he sang maintaining a gentle melody in his voice,&quot;and there&#39;s 
something evil lurking though the dark.&quot;

The six dancers crawled away from the stage as Lust was pretty shocked; 
she had no idea Davis was that good at singing. &quot;Under the moonlight,&quot; 
the dancers slammed their hands in a very hard way, almost like the way 
they would stomp their feet. Davis had his arm facing the ceiling. &quot;You 
see a sight that almost stops your heart,&quot; he clutched his hand to his 
heart as he took five leaping steps backwards. &quot;You try to scream,&quot; 
Davis kept his voice whilst sealing up his nerves, he took slow steps 
forward as he sung his next line. &quot;But terror makes the sound before you 
make it!&quot;

Meanwhile, Tomo placed her head out of the curtains and attempted a 
scary face and pulled her tongue in a cheeky fashion. &quot;You start to 
freeze, as horror looks you right between the eye. You&#39;re out time.&quot; 
Tomo was shaking her head to the beat as her hands became as crooked as 
a branch tree. Her eyes were fixed onto Chiyo, who was sitting in the 
front of the audience, who she was attempting to scare. Chiyo&#39;s eyes 
welled up as was genuinely scared by the performance. Chiyo was a very 
intelligent girl, but also rather young, she was put up five times in a 
row for her intelligence, but that seemed to have been an academic 
disadvantage.

&quot;You hear the door slam!&quot; Ed announced as he and his brother Al stomped 
right back into the stage. &quot;You you realise that there&#39;s nowhere else to 
run. &quot; The Elric brothers stood either side of Davis and grabbed his 
arms.

&quot;You feel the cold hand,&quot; Davis added as his hands then touched their 
shoulders and they both began to shake in fear. &quot;And wonder if you ever 
see the sun. You close your eyes,&quot; Ed and Al closed their eyes as Davis 
turned his face to the pair of them. &quot;And hope that this is just 
imagination.&quot; Ed and Al hugged each other as they both tried to fake the 
fear. &quot;Oh but other while, you hear a creature crawling from behind, 
you&#39;re out of time.&quot;

&quot;CAUSE THIS IS THRILLER!&quot; Davis roared to the top of his voice raising 
his arms. &quot;Thiller&#39;s night. And no one&#39;s gonna save you from the beast 
about to strike. You know it&#39;s thriller, thriller&#39;s night. So let me 
hold you tight inside a killer, thriller tonight.&quot; their legs were 
getting rather flexible as they performed the dance routines. Davis felt 
that he was about to fall over as his balance was on the edge. Ed and Al 
seemed to be coping fine from what Davis could see of them. He did not 
want to fall over on this one, he really hoped he was impressing Kari 
and he hoped she was there to see him singing and dancing.

&quot;This is pretty good,&quot; Winry, a friend of Ed pointed out to Ichigo as 
she was tapping her foot. &quot;Doing a great a great job on this.&quot;

&quot;Better than the lesbian I suppose,&quot; Ichigo pointed out.

&quot;Night creatures crawl, and dead escape their mass grave,&quot; Davis had a 
feeling that he got the lyrics wrong, but he decided not to worry about 
it and he continued singing. Ed and Al were also doing back vocals as 
they were behind Davis. &quot;There&#39;s no escaping of the alien this time.&quot; 
Davis had to admit, he was actually enjoying singing and dancing, 
although he would choose a match of soccer any day of the week. &quot;This is 
the end of your life!&quot; Davis held onto the last high note as the Elric 
brothers stepped backwards to the end of the stage.

Yolei, Cody, Tomo and Yomi returned to the stage as they walked in a 
rather ghostly manner. A young boy wrapped in a black cloak and a white 
mask that revealed half of his face entered the stage holding onto his 
mask. Everybody apart from the man in disguise, had stepped forward and 
stepped on the spot. Davis was in front of them as he stepped to the 
centre again. &quot;Darkness falls across the land,&quot; the cloaked boy spoke, 
as his navy locks ad eyes made is clear that it was Ken. &quot;The midnight 
hour is close at hand. Creatures crawl in search of blood, to terrorise 
thy neighbourhood.&quot;

Chiyo was mortified from what Ken was saying. The way Ken was saying it, 
was so scary, spooky and passionate, that she actually though that this 
was real. &quot;And who ever shall be found, without the soul of getting 
down.&quot; Ken stepped forward as his fascial expression only half visible 
showed a look of death. &quot;Must stand and face the claws of hell, and 
decay inside a corps&#39;s shell.&quot; The young girl closed her eyes and tried 
to block her ears as she felt her heart racing. The rest of the people 
on the stage were staking slow desperate movements towards the audience 
as Tala was still rocking on his guitar. &quot;The foulest stench is in the 
air,&quot; Ken clenched his fist as if he was shattering dust. &quot;The zombies 
of five thousand years and grizzly ghouls from every tomb, are closing 
in to seal your doom.&quot; Ken stepped around the stage speaking out to the 
audience trying to make them feel the terror. &quot;Although you fight to 
stay alive, your body starts to shiver, for no mortal can resist, the 
evil of the thriller.&quot;

Chiyo couldn&#39;t hold onto her fear anymore as the young girl yelled in 
agony. Ken removed his mask as he caused a mechanic laughter. Everybody 
had their eyes on the frightened Chiyo as the tears fell down her eyes 
like a large waterfall. She sighed in relief as soon as she found out 
that they had stopped performing. &quot;That was scary,&quot; she sobbed as she 
tried to wipe her tears away.

&quot;A shame,&quot; Winry muttered. &quot;That was amazing. Shame Chiyo had to spoil 
it.&quot;

&quot;She is much younger than us,&quot; Ichigo added. &quot;She&#39;s bound to act like a 
child.&quot;

&quot;Well thanks a lot you seven,&quot; Kakashi said. &quot;I think that&#39;s enough for 
us, thank you. Let&#39;s see who we have next?&quot;

The audience gave a huge applause as they left the stage. Davis sighed 
in relief as he felt hugely grateful for their help. &quot;Thank you Tala, 
thank you Yomi, thank you Tomo, thank you Yolei, Thank you Cody, Thanks 
a lot Ken! Thank you Ed and thank you Al,&quot; Davis gasped as he bowed. 
&quot;You guys were terrific. I&#39;m sure we impressed the others.&quot;

&quot;We surely scared Chiyo, that&#39;s for sure.&quot; Ken told him as the rest of 
them laughed.

&quot;Well I have to go now,&quot; Tala said as he was on the move. &quot;Bryan and Kai 
will be wondering where I am? I had a great time with you. See ya.&quot;

&quot;Bye Tala!&quot;

&quot;I wonder what Kari thought of it?&quot; Davis wondered to himself.

&quot;You guys were fantastic!&quot; Winry exclaimed as she walked over to them. 
&quot;Davis, you can god damn sing and the rest of you can dance great too. I 
saw Miss Lust smiling as she watched you.&quot;

&quot;We must have been great then.&quot; Tomo pointed out as she removed her 
ripped jacket.

&quot;Kari was sitting close to you,&quot; Davis pointed out as he was thinking 
out feedback from Kari. &quot;Any idea what she thought of it?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t speak to Kari today,&quot; admitted Wirny, so you&#39;ll just have to 
find that out yourself.&quot;

He felt a huge weight of stress had been dropped from her shoulders. He 
was pleased that the audition went well for some of them, although he 
was hoping out of everyone in that audience, that Kari would be the 
person who was the most pleased with performance. He actually did the 
whole thing, in another attempt to impress her. As long as she was 
pleased, it didn&#39;t matter what other people thought.
