<h1>Love is Eternal (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kakaroto.html">Kakaroto</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/loveis-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Author&#39;s Note:
Well, here&#39;s the chapter where Tenchi finds out what Ayeka and Ryoko 
are doing. It takes place six months after the first chapter. Oh, and 
if I get enough good reviews on this, I&#39;ll post a third chapter. After 
that....well, I have my own plans, but only Damien Stryker and I know 
what they are. Oh, and in my fic, Tenchi has a friend at his school 
named Sakuya, who, for the sake of this fic, looks and talks like the 
girl from Tenchi in Tokyo, but this Sakuya isn&#39;t the echo of a 
supernatural being and she and Tenchi have no feelings for each other 
save for their friendship. Finally, if the wedding ceremony in this 
fic bears a resemblance to a known ceremony it&#39;s purely coincidental 
(meaning I made this one up as I wrote the fic).

********************************************************************************************************************************************************

Several months had passed since their first &#39;experiment&#39;, and Ryoko 
and Ayeka had not yet tired of each other&#39;s pleasure, each one always 
coming up with a new position or technique to keep their sex life from 
getting boring. Needless to say, they kept very secret about it. 
Little did they know, however, that it wasn&#39;t going to remain a secret 
for much longer.

Tenchi was running home, clutching the small package he had just 
purchased. He had noticed how well Ryoko and Ayeka were getting along, 
and now was the perfect time to make his move.

He burst through the front door, where the first sight that greeted 
him was the two women who desired him playing a peaceful game of 
chess. Or, at least, the Juraiian equivalent of the game. When the 
door opened, they immediately jumped up, ran to him and clung to his 
sides.

&quot;Woah, easy, girls! Don&#39;t break my ribs!&quot; he said, trying to pry off 
their vicegrip-like arms. Reluctantly, they let go. Then Tenchi had 
Washu, Nobuyuki, Katsuhito, Sasami, Kiyone and Mishoshi summoned to 
the living room.

&quot;Now, I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a long time, and I&#39;ve finally 
made the decision about who I&#39;m going to marry.&quot; Turning to the former 
enemies, he opened up the bag and pulled out two identical golden 
bands. &quot;I want both of you to be my brides. I love each of you so much 
that there is no way I could choose betwen you.&quot;

Ryoko was so happy that, without thinking, she embraced Ayeka and 
kissed her forcefully on the lips, who was more than happy to 
reciprocate. &quot;What&#39;s gotten into you two?&quot; Tenchi asked, his eyes 
bugging out as he beheld the spectacle.

&quot;Well, Lord Tenchi,&quot; Ayeka began, &quot;a few months ago, after that 
incident with the aliens, Ryoko and I were in the onsen and she 
confessed that she loved me as well as you. Well, I wasn&#39;t sure about 
it at first, but, since she saved me during the battle, I allowed her 
to make love to me. And I found out I liked it, so we&#39;ve been doing it 
ever since.&quot; At this point, the princess was blushing so hard that it 
looked like her face was burned.

Needless to say, everyone was stunned. Well, not Kiyone and Mihoshi. 
They had suspected something was going on, but they kept quiet, 
assuming they were wrong. &quot;Gee, looks like we&#39;ll have to make some 
modifications to the normal ceremony.&quot; Nobuyuki said, causing everyone 
to sweatdrop.

&quot;YOU MEAN THIS IS OKAY WITH YOU? THAT YOUR SON IS MARRYING A FORMER 
PIRATE AND THE CROWN PRINCESS OF JURAI, WHO IT SEEMS HAVE BEEN 
SCREWING EACH OTHER&#39;S BRAINS OUT FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS?!?!?!?!?!&quot; 
Katsuhito yelled, a vein on his temple bulging outward.

&quot;Um, well, yeah, I guess.&quot; Nobuyuki said, scratching his chin.

&quot;Oh, okay. Just checking.&quot; his father-in-law replied, resuming his 
normal voice. Everyone in the room fell over.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************

Three weeks had passed since Tenchi proposed to Ryoko and Ayeka. Most 
of the wedding plans had been prepared. The only things still in 
debate were where to hold the ceremony, what kinds of food to serve 
(the first argument Ryoko and Ayeka had had in weeks was over this, 
with Ayeka saying that you did not serve spare ribs at a wedding), 
and, of course, the all-important question.

&quot;How are we supposed to tell the Juraiian Royal Family that I&#39;m 
marrying their daughter?&quot; Tenchi said, pacing back and forth in the 
living room.

&quot;Tenchi, darling, that&#39;s not going to be the biggest problem.&quot; Ryoko 
said, wrapping her arm around his waist and kissing him on the cheek.

Ayeka was puzzled. &quot;What do you mean, Ryoko? My parents will go 
ballistic once they find out.&quot;

&quot;Ayeka, dear, you seem to have forgotten that, in order for this 
particular marriage to work, you and I must also exchange vows.&quot; the 
cyan-haired warrior said, pulling away from Tenchi to sit on the couch 
next to Ayeka.

&quot;EEP! That&#39;s right!&quot; Ayeka now began pacing. &quot;If they&#39;re understanding 
about me marrying Tenchi, they&#39;ll surely go off the deep end when they 
found out that Ryoko and I must marry as well!&quot; She then grabbed 
Tenchi by the shoulders and began shaking him violently. &quot;WHAT ARE WE 
GOING TO DO, TENCHI? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;ll quit trying to dislodge my grandson&#39;s head from his neck,&quot; 
Katsuhito said, stepping into the room, &quot;then I have a suggestion.&quot;

Blushing, Ayeka let go of her to-be husband and sat down beside Ryoko 
again, who couldn&#39;t resist stealing a kiss from her future wife.

Clearing his throat, the aging shrinekeeper said, &quot;Alright, we go 
ahead and have the wedding, then send notice to Jurai explaining the 
whole thing. After the three of you are married, they can do nothing 
about, as it states in Juraiian law.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; Ayeka exclaimed, jumping up from beside the amorous 
pirate. &quot;The best thing that can happen is that they&#39;ll accept Tenchi 
as Emporer, and Ryoko as an Empress. Worst case scenario, I am exiled 
here with Tenchi and Ryoko and Sasami will take my position and the 
First Princess. Either way, we&#39;ll all be happy.&quot;

Tenchi then spoke up. &quot;Um, Ayeka? Didn&#39;t your father marry two women? 
Surely he&#39;d understand.&quot;

&quot;No, Tenchi, he wouldn&#39;t. You&#39;re forgetting that he married two rich 
women.&quot; Ayeka replied shaking her head. &quot;I sincerely doubt anyone in 
my family would understand. Well, except for Aunt Funaho, but her 
influence alone.....&quot;

&quot;Would be more than enough to convince your father and Misaki.&quot; 
Katsuhito finished.

Ryoko&#39;s eyes began to sparkle. &quot;He&#39;s probably right, love. There 
always were rumors about who held the real power on Jurai.&quot;

Ayeka giggled at this. &quot;Ryoko, you&#39;re the only one I know who can make 
jokes at a time like this.&quot; She cupped the ex-pirate&#39;s chin in her 
hand and kissed her briefly on the lips. &quot;It&#39;s no wonder that I fell 
in love with you.&quot;

&quot;Okay, here&#39;s how I see things.&quot; Tenchi began. &quot;We&#39;ll make all the 
preparations, but when it comes time to invite Ayeka&#39;s family, we&#39;ll 
send the message to Funaho and then she&#39;ll be able to convince the 
rest of the Royal House to let us go along with the marriage.&quot;

Nobuyuki looked up from his floor plans and said, &quot;Just one question: 
how do we explain to any humans at the ceremony what the Jurai Royal 
Family in doing there?&quot;

&quot;Actually, Dad,&quot; Tenchi replied, &quot;I wasn&#39;t going to tell anyone else. 
I was thinking that we&#39;d have a very small guest list.&quot; With that, he 
pulled out a folded sheet of paper and gave it to his father, who 
began to read it aloud.

&quot;Mihoshi, Kiyone, Washu, Sakuya and....NAGI????&quot;

&quot;Um, Lord Tenchi, why would you invite Nagi to the wedding? You know 
how she and Ryoko used to be. Aren&#39;t you afraid she&#39;d get a bit, erm, 
jealous and try to do us in?&quot; Ayeka asked.

&quot;It&#39;s a calculated risk, Ayeka. Maybe if she sees that Ryoko is now 
out of her reach, she&#39;ll leave us alone.&quot; Then, he added, &quot;Besides, 
Sasami and Ryo-Ohki wanted her to come, and you know how Sasami gets 
what she wants.&quot;

&quot;You just cannot say &#39;no&#39; to those big blue eyes.&quot; Ayeka said, 
sighing. &quot;That&#39;s how she always got her way on Jurai.&quot;

Ryoko went to the cabinet and pulled out a bottle labeled Pride of 
Edinburgh. &quot;Well, since everything&#39;s settled, why don&#39;t we celebrate a 
bit?&quot; With that, she pulled out five glasses and popped the cork on 
the scotch.

&quot;Really, Ryoko,&quot; Ayeka said, &quot;do you have to celebrate every occasion 
with alcohol?&quot;

&quot;You weren&#39;t complaining about it that night we spent in the woods, 
Princess.&quot; Ryoko replied with a sultry tone to her voice, at which 
Ayeka blushed.

&quot;Well, maybe a little drink wouldn&#39;t hurt.&quot; the princess replied, 
accepting the glass given to her. As if the people in the room had 
received an inaudible cue, they raised their glasses to the ceiling, 
gave a toast to young love, and gulped down the whiskey.

&quot;Well, I guess all we have to do now is set a date, select the 
location, get a caterer and send out the invitations.&quot; Tenchi said.

&quot;Well, you could have the ceremony at the shrine. We don&#39;t get many 
visitors during the week.&quot; Katsuhito offered, pouring himself a drink 
from a bottle labeled Jack Daniels. &quot;I could make all the arrangements 
and you could have it done next Tuesday, if you like.&quot;

Ayeka smiled and bowed her head. &quot;Domo arigato, Lord Katsuhito. I am 
most gracious for your offer.&quot;

The elderly man dismissed it with a wave of the hand that wasn&#39;t 
holding his booze. &quot;Think nothing of it. I need the practice. Last 
wedding I did was the one where I got saddled with him.&quot; He said this 
last part while pointing at Nobuyuki, who was off to one side of the 
room looking at a magazine that had large, red letters on the front 
which read Playboy.

Tenchi shook his head. &quot;Dad, why do you always have to be such a 
hentai?&quot;

Nobuyuki said nothing. He merely turned a deep crimson and quickly ran 
out of the room, trying to hide the magazine behind his back.

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Ryoko said, &quot;we still need to find a caterer. And I think I 
know just the one.&quot;

&quot;What would that be, Ryoko?&quot; Tenchi asked, getting himself another 
glass of scotch.

Just then, Mihoshi and Kiyone entered the room. &quot;She means the one 
where we&#39;re employed.&quot; Kiyone said.

Mihoshi nodded in confirmation. &quot;Yeah. After the GP kicked us off the 
force for inadequacy, we had to find a new job or we&#39;d lose our 
apartment.&quot;

Needless to say, Kiyone was furious. &quot;MIHOSHI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was 
going to wait and tell them later, preferably after the wedding, but 
NOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I swear, your big mouth has gotten me into more 
trouble than I care to remember! I honestly don&#39;t know how I could 
have ever fallen in love with you!&quot; The instant she said that, the 
teal-haired woman wished she hadn&#39;t. &quot;Um, what I mean is, er, 
um....oh, crap.&quot;

&quot;So, Mihoshi, that&#39;s why you two wanted an apartment of your own.&quot; 
Ryoko said with a devilish grin on her face. She and Ayeka knew, of 
course, that the two other women had a more-than-friends relationship, 
but they decided to have a little fun with the ex-detectives.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ayeka added with an equally devilish grin, &quot;all the pieces have 
fallen into place. The way you&#39;re always in a hurry to get home, those 
late night walks you take.....It all makes perfect sense now.&quot;

Mihoshi, unlike Kiyone, was ecstatic. &quot;Wow, Kiyone! We don&#39;t have to 
keep it a secret anymore!&quot; With that she kissed her partner on the 
lips, arousing a cheer from Ayeka and Ryoko.

&quot;You know,&quot; Katsuhito said, &quot;if you love each other so much, I could 
make the arrangements and have you married.&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot; Kiyone screamed, breaking away from Mihosh. &quot;I mean, I don&#39;t 
think we&#39;re ready for that just yet. Come on, Mihoshi. Let&#39;s see if 
our boss can give them a discount rate since it&#39;s a wedding and all.&quot; 
With that, the two former detectives left the room.

&quot;Tenchi,&quot; Ryoko began, &quot;let me send out Nagi&#39;s invitation. It would be 
best if she got it from me instead of someone else.&quot;

Tenchi seemed to agree with her. &quot;Alright, Ryoko. I guess I&#39;d better 
tell Sakuya, and Ayeka can inform her family. I guess that&#39;s 
everything we need.&quot;

&quot;Not quite.&quot; Sasami said, bursting into the room. &quot;I&#39;ve still got to 
decide how big to make the cake.&quot;

Ayeka sighed. &quot;Sasami, I know you love to cook, and you&#39;ve made some 
fantastic desserts in the past, but I think this cake would just be 
too much for you to handle.&quot;

The younger princess giggled. &quot;Not with this, it isn&#39;t!&quot; With that, 
she pulled out an interdimensional portal, one that Washu had 
constructed specifically for storing large things. Gazing into the 
portal, the room&#39;s occupants saw quite possibly the largest pastry 
oven in the world. &quot;See? With this, I can make a cake the size of 
Tokyo Tower!&quot;

Ayeka was forced to smile. &quot;Alright, Sasami, if you think you can 
handle it, you can make our cake.&quot;

The young girl closed the portal and skipped off happily. &quot;I&#39;ve got to 
look through that book and get the right design!&quot; The book she was 
speaking of was a cookbook that Ayeka had gotten her for her birthday 
the year before. Since then, she had been making all sorts of fancy 
foreign dishes and several exquisite desserts.

&quot;Well, I guess that does it for the preparations.&quot; Ryoko said. Then, 
getting an idea, she turned to Tenchi. &quot;Hey, since we&#39;re getting 
married anyway, why don&#39;t the three of us go upstairs?&quot;

&quot;An excellent idea, Ryoko.&quot; Ayeka said. &quot;I&#39;ve been itching to try out 
that new pair of handcuffs.&quot;

Tenchi gulped. &quot;Um, no offense, girls, but I&#39;d rather wait until after 
the wedding.&quot;

Both women sighed in defeat. &quot;If that is what you wish, Tenchi,&quot; Ayeka 
returned, &quot;then we will abide by it.&quot; Then, getting a wicked grin and 
an equally wicked idea, she said, &quot;Ryoko, what&#39;s to stop you and me 
from having a little fun?&quot;

Ryoko smiled and said, &quot;Race you to the onsen!&quot; With that, the two 
females run out of the room, leaving Tenchi behind with a glass of 
scotch in his hand, his eyes as wide as dinner plates, and blood 
draining from his nose. &quot;How can those two, Ayeka in particular, be so 
hentai? It just doesn&#39;t seem possible!&quot; he said before fainting.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************

At last, after much expectation, the day for the wedding had arrived. 
It was going to be a small ceremony, even though everyone was busy.

Washu and Sakuya were serving as asistants to Ryoko and Ayeka in their 
last-minute preparations, Mihoshi and Kiyone were setting out the food 
(Ayeka had conceded to let Ryoko have ribs on the buffet), Nobuyuki 
was making sure Tenchi&#39;s suit wasn&#39;t wrinkled, Katsuhito was doing his 
final check to ensure the ceremony went flawlessly, and Sasami was 
putting the finishing touches on the seven-foot-tall white wedding 
cake with figurines of the brides and groom on top. Only one thing was 
missing.

&quot;The wedding&#39;s about to start and Nagi isn&#39;t here yet.&quot; Ryoko said. 
She was dressed in a long, elegant red dress with no sleeves and a 
single wide strap that went around her neck with matching heels. She 
was also pacing nervously on the floor.

&quot;Calm down, love.&quot; Ayeka said, placing her hand on Ryoko&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;She&#39;ll be here. If she still cares about you as much as you&#39;ve 
indicated, then she&#39;ll at least want to see you happy.&quot; Ayeka, in a 
white version of Ryoko&#39;s dress, was the very image of calm and peace.

Ryoko sighed and embraced the princess. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right. And 
if she isn&#39;t here, it means she no longer cares and isn&#39;t coming back. 
Either way, I win.&quot; But she didn&#39;t sound to happy about that. Ayeka 
said so.

&quot;I guess it&#39;s because I still feel a certain attraction to her. She&#39;s 
very beautiful, and she was a real demon in the sack....&quot; The 
ex-pirate stopped her trip down memory lane when she saw Ayeka had 
crossed her arms and was tapping her foot on the floor. &quot;Not that you 
aren&#39;t even better then she was, Ayeka; there was just something about 
her.&quot;

Just then, Sakuya yelled to them from the other side of the shrine. 
&quot;Ryoko, I think your old flame has arrived.&quot; No sooner had the 
dark-haired girl said this than a tall, hard-featured cyan-haired 
woman appeared on top of the stairs leading to the shrine. She was 
dressed in a knee-length blue skirt, a full green blouse and yellow 
heels.

&quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Ryoko.&quot; Nagi said, smiling to the best of her 
ability. The former pirate ran to the bounty hunter and hugged her.

Ryoko couldn&#39;t hold back her tears. &quot;Nagi, even though we&#39;re not 
together anymore and I&#39;ve moved on in my life, I hope that we can at 
least be friends.&quot;

&quot;No problem there, old girl. I&#39;ve moved on, too. Found me a new woman 
to spend my nights with. A redhead in the Galaxy Police top brass.&quot;

Ryoko chuckled. &quot;If I&#39;m right, that&#39;s the same woman that fired my 
friends, Mihoshi and Kyone.&quot;

Nagi looked shocked. &quot;You know those two?&quot; As if on cue, the former 
detectives peeked around the doorway and waved before disappearing 
back into the shrine&#39;s main room. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be. I could try and get 
them reenstated, if you want.&quot;

&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary. They work as caterers now, and they seem 
happy enough with that and each other.&quot; The look on her former lover&#39;s 
face was priceless to Ryoko. &quot;Yes, those two are about as in love as 
you can get.&quot;

Just then, Ayeka walked up to them and put her arms around Ryoko. 
&quot;Love, I think it&#39;s almost time to get started.&quot;

&quot;So, Princess Ayeka and former Most Wanted Pirate Ryoko really are 
marrying the heir-apparent to the Jurai throne. And each other, it 
would seem. What a scandal this would make for the Galactic Tattler.&quot; 
Nagi said before allowing a cringing Ayeka to lead them into the main 
chamber.

Inside, they found Ayeka&#39;s family sitting in some chairs set up near 
the back of the room, Tenchi and Nobuyuki were off to one side of the 
low meditation table where Katsuhito was kneeling, and everyone else 
was seated in a row of chairs to the left of the door. Nagi took a 
seat beside Washu. Ryoko noted that there were also several of Washu&#39;s 
acquaintances from the Royal Science Academy sitting near Azaka and 
Kamidake, who were situated just behind Katsuhito.. Ryo-Ohki and 
Ken-Ohki were not present, but everyone had a good idea where *they* 
were.

Ayeka took a good, long look at her family, expecting to see a look of 
disappointment, but all she found were three smiles that she knew were 
very real and very sincere. As she and Ryoko walked hand in hand down 
the carpeted path to the table, for the first time since Tenchi had 
proposed to her and Ryoko, the princess truly felt secure about what 
was happening.

Once they reached the table, Tenchi moved between them and all three 
got on their knees, their hands folded into their laps.

Katsuhito cleared his throat before speaking. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen 
who are assembled here today, we are here to witness the joining of 
this man and these women in the bonds of marriage. If anyone has 
anything to say, speak now, for it is the only time your words will be 
heeded.&quot;

Immediately, Ayeka&#39;s father stood up. &quot;I have only one thing I wish to 
say: I had always hoped that my daughter would someday marry a rich, 
powerful man that would add military and political strength to the 
Juraiian Empire. But now, I see that she has done much more than that. 
It is obvious that she loves these two. Upon examination of their 
records, I have seen that, even though Ryoko was rather unscrupulous 
in the past, she has redeemed herself and the boy - no the man - has 
more than proven his worth. The only thing I can possibly do is give 
them the full rights and privelages of members of the Jurai Royal 
Household.&quot; After he had finished and sat down, loud applause went up 
from everyone in the room.

&quot;Now that we have that out of the way, let us proceed with the vows. 
We will begin with Ryoko and Ayeka.&quot;

The two women stood up and faced each other, Tenchi backing off a 
little to give them some room. Ryoko was the first to speak. &quot;Ayeka, I 
cannot lie. At first, only saw you as competition for Tenchi. But, as 
we spent time together under the same roof, I began to see a side of 
you I had never expected to exist. The fact that you tolerated me all 
this time is only a small part of it. You&#39;re a kind, sweet, 
compassionate woman, and I was a fool not to recognize it earlier. I 
love you, Ayeka, more than any words could ever say.&quot; With that, Ryoko 
clasped Ayeka&#39;s hands in her own.

Next, it was the princess&#39; turn. &quot;Ryoko, I first saw you as an 
immoral, unethical she-devil who would stop at nothing to disgrace me, 
and I thought your love for Tenchi was just another ploy that you 
tried to use to get to me. Over time, though, I began to realize that 
you really did have feelings for him, and I am sorry for everything I 
said or did that may have hurt you. It took a strong force, Ryoko, but 
you and I were eventually brought together, and now we can finally 
both have what we&#39;ve wanted for the past year. I love you, Ryoko, as 
much as I have ever loved anything or anyone in my life.&quot;

Finally, Tenchi stood and stepped inbetween the women, the three of 
them joining their hands in a circle.. Katsuhito gave a nod, and the 
young man began to speak. &quot;Ryoko, Ayeka, I love you both with all my 
heart and sould. It was a shock to hear you had fallen in love with 
each other, as well, but I know that it can only ensure a stronger 
bond between the three of us. I hereby accept both of you into my 
heart, as you have accepted me into yours, and take you as my brides.&quot;

Ryoko looked at the princess lovingly and said, &quot;Ayeka, I would be 
honored to accept you as my wife.&quot;

&quot;And I, Ryoko, accept you as my wife, and bestow upon you the title of 
Empress of Jurai, and your power in the Empire is equal to my own.&quot;

Ryoko then turned away from Ayeka to face Tenchi, saying, &quot;I accept 
you as my husband, Tenchi, and I hope the three of us can live a long, 
happy lifetime together.&quot;

The final set of vows was Ayeka&#39;s to give. &quot;Tenchi Masaki, I give you 
my hand in marriage and bestow upon you the title of Emporer of Jurai, 
the supreme ruler of our Empire.&quot; With this, all three bowed their 
heads and closed their eyes as Katsuhito stood and said a small ritual 
prayer.

&quot;And now,&quot; the old man said, &quot;I pronounce the three of you officially 
bonded by marriage. May you be happy with your lives and make the 
right choices.&quot; With that, everyone rushed to the center of the room 
to congratulate the newlyweds.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************

After the party had ended, everyone else had either gone to their 
respective homes or, in the case of Mihoshi and Kiyone, back to work, 
so only Nagi remained. Tenchi had been given strict instructions not 
to interrupt while the bounty hunter conversed with Ayeka and Ryoko. 
Tenchi lost all track of time as he sat and watched them from a 
distance, and he nearly jumped out if his skin when he felt a hand 
fall upon his shoulder.

&quot;Whatcha thinkin&#39; about there, son?&quot; Nobuyuki asked him.

&quot;Just everything we&#39;ve been through since I met all these girls. I 
mean, we&#39;ve had a lot of adventures together. And now, with Kagato 
dead and Nagi no longer an enemy, I just wonder if all that craziness 
is over.&quot;

Nobuyuki laughed and said, &quot;Son, your adventures are just beginning. 
You&#39;ve got two beautiful brides there who love each other as much as 
they love you. You&#39;ll find that there will be many times you&#39;ll go 
through things that make your battle with Kagato look like a walk in 
the park.&quot; Then, as an afterthought, &quot;Oh, I almost forgot to give you 
your wedding present.&quot; With that, he reached into his briefcase and 
pulled out a rolled-up sheet of paper. &quot;Here ya go. Ten acres of 
choice land just a few miles away from the major highways and not too 
far away from here.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Dad, but what about a house?&quot;

&quot;That was Washu&#39;s department. I designed it, but she&#39;s the one who 
contructed it.&quot; With that, he reached into his briefcase again and 
pulled out a small silver rectangle with a red button on it. &quot;All you 
have to do is set this down somewhere, press the button and stand 
back.&quot;

&quot;You know, it just won&#39;t be the same without Sasami, Mihoshi, Kiyone 
and Washu around. And then there&#39;s you and Grandpa. I&#39;m going to miss 
you all.&quot;

&quot;Son, why do you think I gave you land so close to the house? Anytime 
things get too difficult, or you get too lonely, or even if you just 
wanna stop by for a friendly chat, we&#39;re just a couple of miles down 
the road.&quot;

About this time, the three women came up to Tenchi and Nobuyuki. Nagi 
was the first to speak &quot;It&#39;s time I got going. I need to find Ken-Ohki 
and get back into space. I&#39;ve been on the trail of this master thief 
for months now and I&#39;m close to catching him.&quot;

&quot;If I had known you were busy,&quot; Ryoko said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have sent you 
the invitation. I&#39;m sorry if I interrupted anything.&quot;

&quot;Forget it, Ryoko. I needed a break, anyway. Even if it was only to 
see you in the arms of another.&quot; She shot a grin at Tenchi. &quot;You be 
careful with her, boy. If you aren&#39;t, and I get word of it, I&#39;m gonna 
have to come down here and teach you how to treat a lady.&quot; Then she 
winked at him and walked away.

&quot;She&#39;s a nice woman once you get to know her, isn&#39;t she, Ryoko?&quot; Ayeka 
said, leaning into the forearm of the woman she loved.

&quot;That she is, Ayeka. That she is.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Tenchi interrupted, &quot;what did you three talk about over there 
that was so top-secret that your husband wasn&#39;t privy to the 
information?&quot;

Ryoko grinned evilly and leaned downward to whisper in his ear, &quot;Ideas 
on how to spend the honeymoon.&quot; Then she and Ayeka began laughing as 
Tenchi gulped nervously.

A few minutes later, after saying their goodbyes to Nobuyuki and 
Katsuhito, Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko got into the hovercar Nagi had 
given them. For the life of him, Tenchi still couldn&#39;t figure out how 
she just pulled it out of her purse like that. Chuckling a bit, he 
gunned the engine and took off in the direction of the land where they 
would begin building their lives together.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************

A short while later, Tenchi landed the hovercar in the center of a 
large clearing. There were trees on two sides, the mountains on 
another, and a small access road leading into the main highway system. 
&quot;Oh, Tenchi! It&#39;s absolutely perfect!&quot; Ryoko and Ayeka said in unison 
as they stepped out of the car along with their husband.

Tenchi, meanwhile, had run up ahead and placed the little box about 
two hundred yards from the mountains. After pressing the button, he 
ran back to the hovercar and watched as the box disappeared and was 
replaced by a large black hole. A few seconds later, the hold 
collapsed on itself and in its place was a carbon copy of the house 
where Tenchi had grown up.

&quot;Well, Dad did say he designed the house.&quot; Tenchi said, smiling. He 
quickly got their bags out of the car and walked up to the front door, 
his brides following closely behind. Using the key under the doormat, 
he opened the solid-oak door and gazed into an exact replica of his 
old home.

Except, of course, that the television in the living room took up an 
entire wall.

After setting the bags down, he was about to walk in when Ayeka 
reminded him of the tradition of carrying the bride across the 
threshold. After a bit of thinking, he was able to put Ryoko in his 
arms and then stooped a bit to allow Ayeka to climb on top of her.

It was the longest, hardest three steps of Tenchi&#39;s life. When he 
finally got inside and the girls climbed off, he made a mental note to 
consult a chiropractor. However, the note taped to the television 
screen and the stack of videos beside it made him lose that train of 
thought.

Plucking the note off the screen and opening it, he found it was from 
Washu. &quot;Dear Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko. I hope you enjoy the house. I 
put an extra-large onsen upstairs, and the broom closet is where you 
can find my latest invention, Robo-Maid. You&#39;ll have to give her a 
name before you can tell her to do anything, though. Well, until you 
decide to visit us, goodbye!

Little Washu, the Galaxy&#39;s Cutest Genius&quot;

Tenchi chuckled at the letter. He was about to show it to his wives 
when he heard Ayeka gasp. &quot;What&#39;s the problem?&quot; he asked, turning 
around. Instantly, he saw what she was looking at.

Every single one of the tapes had some kind of sexually suggestive 
name to it. &quot;Man, some of this stuff&#39;s even too wierd for me. Hey, 
hey, hey! Lookie what we got here!&quot; Ryoko said, holding up a video. On 
it was a simple hand-written label reading, &#39;Nobuyuki and Achika&#39;s 
First Date&#39;. Below it was &#39;Nobuyuki and Achika&#39;s Honeymoon&#39;, which was 
followed by &#39;Nobuyuki and Achika&#39;s First Anniversary&#39;, and so on and 
so on.

Tenchi freaked out, screaming at the top of his lungs. &quot;Okay, I can 
understand the rest of these. But why would Dad give me tapes of him 
and Mom having sex????&quot; Just then, Tenchi&#39;s cel phone rang. It was 
Nobuyuki.

&quot;Hey, son.&quot; he said. &quot;I heard the scream. I&#39;m supposing you either 
found the tapes, or Robo-Maid went nuts.&quot; Tenchi confirmed it was the 
tapes. &quot;Well, you don&#39;t have to watch them. I mainly put them there 
for Ryoko and Ayeka, to give them an idea of how life was for me and 
your mother. Who knows? Maybe some of the stuff we did will give your 
life some added spice. Oh, and listen, your Grandpa stocked the 
library. Mostly, it&#39;s full of history books and stuff on martial arts. 
But there&#39;s one imported book that&#39;s......well, let&#39;s say its about 
the marital arts.&quot;

&quot;GRANDPA GAVE US A COPY OF THE KAMA SUTRA???????&quot; Tenchi yelled.

&quot;Yeah, it surprised me, too. He said it&#39;s an adaptation of a Jurai 
tradition. You see, on Jurai, when a girl gets married, her parents 
stay with the new couple on the wedding night to give a few lessons on 
technique and to demonstrate a few positions. Since Achika&#39;s dead, 
though, we opted to go for the next best thing. Well, I have to go 
now, son. Sasami&#39;s brought out the leftover ribs from the wedding, and 
I&#39;m starting to get hungry.&quot; With that, Nobuyuki hung up.

&quot;I have a very, very strange family.&quot; Tenchi said as he carried the 
luggage upstairs.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************

After he had finished unpacking his things, Tenchi went back 
downstairs. As soon as he entered the living room, however, he could 
smell something wonderful coming from the kitchen. His curiosity 
peaked, Tenchi entered the room and got perhaps the biggest shock of 
his life.

Ayeka was seated at the table slicing vegetables and Ryoko was at the 
stove frying up some sort meat. What shocked him the most wasn&#39;t the 
fact that they were cooking, however.

It was the fact that they were doing it naked.

A few seconds after he walked in, Ayeka looked up at him and smiled. 
&quot;Hello, Tenchi. We thought we&#39;d give you an added surprise for dinner 
tonight.&quot;

Tenchi, needless to say, was speechless. That is, he was until Ryoko 
materialized behind him, her firm breasts pressing into his back. That 
was more than enough to snap him out of it. &quot;Please, girls, this is a 
bit too much right now.&quot;

Sighing, Ayeka said, &quot;Gomen nasai, Tenchi. It was my idea. I thought 
it might loosen you up a bit for tonight.&quot; Standing up, and exposing 
her body to Tenchi in the process, Ayeka went to the kitchen closet, 
pulled out a simple blue tank top and a light pair of green slacks, 
and got dressed.

Ryoko, sighing in defeat, phased into a white halter top with matching 
knee-length skirt and went back to the beef, somewhat disappointed in 
her husband&#39;s reaction.

After regaining his composure, Tenchi spoke to them. &quot;I appreciate you 
trying to do this, girls, but it was less than a month ago that I 
found out you two were sleeping together. I know we&#39;re married and 
all, but let&#39;s just take this one step at a time, alright?&quot; Smiling, 
both girls nodded in agreement. Ayeka emptied the vegetables into the 
mixture of beef and teriyaki sauce, making Tenchi&#39;s mouth awter in 
anticipation.

Deciding to leave the kitchen duties to his wives, Tenchi went into 
the living room and plopped down in fron of the television, inserting 
one of his own movies into the VCR: an American film called 
Independence Day.

About halfway through the movie, Ayeka poked her head into the room 
and announced that dinner was ready. Shutting the tape off, Tenchi 
went back into the kitchen and beheld a meal that, quite honestly, he 
didn&#39;t believe Ryoko could prepare without the use of a fire 
extinguisher.

In the center of the table was a large bowl of rice. Beside it was the 
wok containing the beef and vegetables. Then, of course, there was the 
bottle of French wine. &quot;And we&#39;ve got a cake in the oven for dessert.&quot; 
Ryoko said, obviously proud of her accomplishment.

Sitting down at the table, Tenchi thanked his wives for the meal and 
began filling his plate while Ayeka filled his wine glass. After one 
bite, he turned to Ryoko and asked, &quot;How did you ever manage to make 
this? No offense, Ryoko, but you haven&#39;t exactly shown a talent for 
cooking in the past.&quot;

The ex-pirate smiled and said, &quot;Sakuya gave me this before she went 
home.&quot; With that, she reached into a drawer built into the counter and 
produced a book titled Cooking on a Budget: A How-To Guide for New 
Housewives. &quot;According to her, it&#39;s one of the best beginner&#39;s 
cookbooks out there.&quot;

&quot;Well, if all the recipes in there are as good as this,&quot; Tenchi 
replied, wolfing down another bite, &quot;then I&#39;m gonna be one very happy 
husband.&quot;

&quot;Oh, believe me, Tenchi,&quot; Ayeka said as she and Ryoko sat down, &quot;this 
is only one of the surprises you get tonight.&quot; Then, after making a 
toast to a long, happy life together, she said, &quot;That book Katsuhito 
gave us and the tapes Nobuyuki left here will see to that.&quot;

Tenchi was still a bit wary of the overall kinkiness displayed in the 
two women, and by Ayeka in particular, but he found himself getting 
used to it. It wasn&#39;t long before the three of them had exhausted the 
supply of food and were halfway done with the wine.

&quot;You know,&quot; Ryoko said, &quot;I&#39;m an expert on this sort of thing, and we&#39;d 
better stop before we end up drunk. I mean, we wanna be able to 
remember tonight, don&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;I agree, Ryoko.&quot; Ayeka said, pushing her empty glass aside. &quot;Well, 
let&#39;s clear this up and then we can relax before heading up to bed.&quot; 
With that, the women stood up and began the process of emptying the 
table. Once that was finished, Tenchi helped them get the dishes 
washed and safely put away in the cupboards. After about a half hour, 
the three found themselves sitting on the large couch in the living 
room, Tenchi in the middle while his brides rested their heads upon 
his shoulders and he wrapped his arms around their waists.

After what seemed like hours of this peace, the phone rang. Reaching 
over Ryoko&#39;s shoulders, he picked it up off the cradle and pressed a 
button.

&quot;Hi, Tenchi, it&#39;s Washu. I hope I&#39;m not disturbing you.&quot; the voice on 
the other end of the line said.

&quot;No, not at all. We were just resting a bit. What&#39;s up?&quot; he replied.

&quot;Well, for one thing, don&#39;t activate Robo-Maid just yet.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just say I forgot to put in Azimov&#39;s third Law of Robotics.&quot;

Tenchi gulped. &quot;Isn&#39;t that the one that says, &#39;A robot shall never, 
under any circumstances, harm a human or, by its own inaction, allow 
one to be harmed&#39;?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a smart boy, Tenchi. I&#39;m teleporting Robo-Maid back to my lab. 
I noticed a couple of potential bugs in the basic programming, anyway, 
and it never hurts to double check. So, how&#39;s everything holding up 
for you three? You taking care of my daughter and daughter-in-law?&quot; 
Washu let out a little giggle at her own joke.

&quot;We&#39;re all fine over here. You&#39;re not going to believe this, but 
Ryoko&#39;s turning out to be an excellent cook, although they did 
surprise me a bit before dinner.&quot; He told her about walking in on the 
two of them stark naked in the kitchen.

&quot;And that was Ayeka&#39;s idea? Tenchi, I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s already been 
watching Nobuyuki&#39;s tapes. According to him, that&#39;s the same thing 
Achika used on him the day they were married.&quot; She then heard Tenchi 
gulp through the reciever. &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t worry too much. I mean, you 
won&#39;t have to work as hard as Nobuyuki did. You may have two wives, 
but the two of them enjoy pleasuring each other as much as they&#39;ll 
enjoy doing it to you. Basically, although they may get some kinky 
ideas at times, I think you can handle it. Well, I gotta get back to 
work. Robo-Maid just got here and I want to run that diagnostic. See 
ya!&quot;

After hanging up the phone, Tenchi gently shook his brides awake, told 
them about his conversation with Washu and watched as Ayeka blushed a 
deep scarlet.

&quot;Well, Tenchi, I did get the idea from your mother. Before the 
wedding, I sat down and spoke with Nobuyuki about what I should do 
once I was your wife. And then he told me several stories, even let me 
watch a couple of his videos. Oh, and the photos he has of her....&quot; 
Ayeka shuddered at that one, apparently something very naughty coming 
to mind.

&quot;I have a feeling,&quot; Tenchi said, &quot;that we&#39;d better get upstairs before 
the two of you decide that you can&#39;t hold out any longer.&quot; Laughing, 
the three of them made their way to the bedroom.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************

Once inside, the two women pushed Tenchi down onto the bed with Ayeka 
holding him down. &quot;Just relax, my dear Tenchi,&quot; she said as Ryoko 
began removing first her clothing, then Ayeka&#39;s, &quot;and enjoy the show.&quot; 
Before Tenchi knew it, his own clothes had been removed and he was 
laying on the bed while Ayke and Ryoko began arguing over who was to 
get him first.

&quot;Ryoko, you know very good and well that, if it weren&#39;t for you, we 
wouldn&#39;t even be here on this planet and I&#39;d probably be stuck with 
some poor excuse for a husband instead of the loving specimen we both 
have here. Therefore, you should be the first.&quot;

&quot;Ayeka, if you hadn&#39;t decided to &#39;repay me&#39; that day in the onsen, we 
would never have come to our senses.&quot;

&quot;Well, you were the one who initiated it to start with. If I recall, 
it was *YOU* who confessed to loving *ME*, not the other way around.&quot;

Ryoko again sighed in defeat. &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll go first. But Tenchi,&quot; 
she said, &quot;you&#39;d better give her at least as much as you give me, got 
it?&quot;

&quot;How could I ever slight either of you when I love you both so much?&quot; 
he replied, cupping Ryoko&#39;s chin and kissing her. Ayeka got off the 
bed so as to give them plenty of room.

A tear of happiness in her eye, Ryoko straddled Tenchi&#39;s hips and 
gently lowered herself onto him, both of them moaning in pleasure as 
he filled her up. Once he was in her up to the hilt, she slowly lifted 
upwards before coming back down, savoring the feeling of him 
carressing her inner walls.

Tenchi, meanwhile, began to grow impatient. Gripping her buttocks, he 
began to move her up and down with more force and speed, making 
Ryoko&#39;s moans grow even louder and causing her breasts to bounce 
wildly.

Ryoko hit her forst orgasm in a matter of moments and began building 
towards the second. Suddenly, she felt something poking her in the 
rear. Looking over her shoulder, she saw that is was Ayeka with her 
long, thick, two-way vibrator; an instrument they had used on several 
occasions and was among their favorites. Before the pirate could say 
anything, the princess had switched it on and plunged into Ryoko&#39;s 
entrance, making her cyan-haired lover howl in pleasure as the two 
people she cared for the most began making love to her.

&#39;At least...you two....won&#39;t be...ah...bored....while I&#39;m....not 
here....&quot; Tenchi said inbetween breaths.

But neither girl heard him. Ayeka had grabbed Ryoko&#39;s breasts while 
pushing her own into the other woman&#39;s back, and Ryoko had pulled 
Ayeka into a deep kiss, their tongues intertwining as they moved 
together. FInally, the biggest orgasm Ryoko had ever experienced hit 
her and she felt her muscles contracting, both around Tenchi and the 
vibrator. This sudden pressure forced Tenchi to release his essence 
into her, and, due to good timing, Ayeka came at that moment, as well.

&quot;Let me rest up a bit, Ayeka,&quot; Tenchi said, &quot;and you can have a turn.&quot;

The violet-haired woman, however, could not stand to wait. Motioning 
Ryoko to move aside, she crawled up to Tenchi and placed his softening 
member in her mouth. She could still taste Ryoko on him, and that made 
it even more erotic. After a few minutes of gentle sucking, he was 
back to full rigidity and ready for another round. Laying down beside 
him, she spread her legs for her husband, using her hands to part her 
glistening-wet lips edged with the same shade of purple that was on 
her head.

Positioning himself over her, Tenchi entered her in one quick thrust, 
making her cry out and wrap her limbs around him. Ryoko, however, 
wanted a little pleasure, as well, so she manuevered between them and 
placed her legs on either side of Ayeka&#39;s head, indicating what she 
wanted.

Ayeka was more than happy to comply. She immediately forced her tongue 
into Ryoko&#39;s entrance, eliciting a howl from the pirate.

Tenchi, deciding that it was time he showed he could handle both of 
them at once, gripped Ryoko&#39;s breasts and massaged them, pleasuring 
her while at the same time using the added leverage to increase the 
force of his thrusts into Ayeka. Soon, all three of them hit their 
peaks, each one screaming in obvious passion.

When it was all over, the three just collapsed onto each other. After 
catching their breath, Tenchi and Ryoko rolled off and lay on either 
side of Ayeka. &quot;I could go for another round.&quot; Ryoko said after a few 
minutes had passed. &quot;How about you two?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Ryoko, but I&#39;m burned out for now.&quot; Tenchi replied.

&quot;Well, maybe this will get you back in the mood.&quot; Ayeka said, grabbing 
Ryoko and pulling her off the bed. Tenchi watched as the two women 
embraced each other and then started to make out. Eventually, they 
made their way to the floor, where Ryoko took the offensive.

Climbing atop her lover, the cyan-haired beauty first kissed Ayeka&#39;s 
neck, then trailed downward towards her heaving breasts, which were 
far larger than the Juraiian robes she always wore led you to believe. 
Ryoko allowed her tongue to play over first one mound, then the other, 
carefully avoiding the bright pink cap that was on each one. After 
what seemed like hours to Ayeka, Ryoko finally secured her lips around 
one nipple and began sucking on it while her hand played with the 
other breast. After playing with the princess&#39; busoms for a while, the 
pirate then walked her tongue down the woman&#39;s body stopping briefly 
to play in the navel and then, much to Ayeka&#39;s chagrin, she stopped.

&quot;What did you do that for, Ryoko?&quot; Ayeka asked.

&quot;I just wanted to make sure you were hot and wet enough for what I 
have in mind, dear. After all, you can&#39;t expect me to take my next 
meal without something to drink, can you?&quot; Before Ayeka could give an 
answer, Ryoko turned completely around and lowered her face to her 
lover&#39;s lower lips, breathing in the aroma for a moment before sliding 
her tongue into the hole, an action which Ayeka was more than happy to 
reciprocate.

This constant licking and sucking went on for a good five minutes and 
coutnless orgasms before Tenchi, who had been watching in fascination 
as his wives made love to each other, reached his limit. Getting off 
the bed, he went over to them and forced the women apart. Without a 
word, he laid Ryoko on her back, spread her legs and motioned for them 
to stay there. Then, he got the vibrator, stuck one end into Ayeka&#39;s 
dripping pussy, and directed her to Ryoko&#39;s entrance.

Ayeka once again turned the device on and began ramming into Ryoko for 
all she was worth. Tenchi, his &#39;little soldier&#39; standing at full 
attention, gripped Ayeka&#39;s hips and forced his way into her ass, the 
tightness of the hole immediately getting to him. It wasn&#39;t long 
before Ayeka came due to the pleasure of the vibrator and Tenchi 
erupted into her once again. She collapsed onto the floor, completely 
spent and the vibrator still inside Ryoko.

&#39;&#39;Tenchi, dear, why don&#39;t you give me some of that, hm?&quot; she said, 
removing the flexible toy from inside her and opening her lips for 
Tenchi, who gladly slipped in. It was, however, not long before Ryoko 
reached her orgasm and she felt Tenchi withdraw before he placed his 
member in front of her face.

Getting on her knees, Ryoko took his length in her mouth and down her 
throat, enjoying the sounds Tenchi made as she worked him. Before he 
reached his own climax, however, Tenchi pulled her off of him, 
motioned for her to get on all fours, and then rammed up into her via 
the back door.

Ryoko was loving every minute of this. Never had she dreamed Tenchi 
would get this excited on their wedding night. What&#39;s more, the piece 
of flesh inserted into her ass felt better than any dildo or vibrator 
she and Ayeka had found over the course of the last few months. Just 
when she thought she couldn&#39;t take anymore, she reached her orgasm. 
Her muscles clenched around Tenchi, and she heard him grunt just 
before he shot into her. Ryoko then fell forward onto the floor, 
Tenchi collapsing beside her. The three newlyweds spent their first 
night together like this; extremely tired, but thoroughly satisfied.

Well, what did you think of part two of this? As I said, good reviews 
mean a third installment; bad reviews mean you have no taste in fics. 
Oh, and to Damien Stryker, I&#39;ve finally figured out how to write that 
little fic you wanted me to do, so, depending on whether I make a 
third chapter to this or not, you&#39;ll probably be seeing it in a little 
while.
