<h1>Conquest (part 18 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>        The bridge was almost silent as Ruri simply lay her hands just 
above the large control panel, an odd light appearing in her wide, 
dark eyes. &quot;Preparing for transit back into normal space,&quot; she 
murmured to herself softly.

        &quot;How rough is this going to be?&quot; Mitsuki asked Rhione softly 
as they stood to one side of the ship&#39;s bridge. After the two day trip 
she was almost eager to get to work.

        &quot;Normally real-space transit can be rough,&quot; Rhione quietly 
admitted, &quot;but I understand that Ruri is remarkably skilled.&quot;

        &quot;Aproaching re-entry point,&quot; Ruri announced.

        &quot;Confirming status with Ryo-Ohki,&quot; Rei spoke up softly from 
her communications post, &quot;entry point confirmed.&quot;

        &quot;Shields to maximum,&quot; Minagi ordered.

        &quot;Shields ready,&quot; Asuka worked her own set of controls 
smoothly, &quot;tactical systems ready.&quot;

        &quot;Re-entry to normal space in five.... four... three.. two, 
one!&quot; Ruri reported, even as the stars reappeared in viewports across 
the ship.

        THOOM! The ship rocked under them as something detonated 
outside the ship. Minagi held onto her command seat, &quot;Tactical, 
report!&quot;

        &quot;Sensors are still off from transit,&quot; Asuka worked quickly, 
then turned to the others on the bridge, &quot;Get somebody looking out 
viewports!&quot;

        Mitsuki ran to the nearest one even as she wondered why she 
hadn&#39;t thought of that herself. &quot;There&#39;s a pitched battle outside!&quot; 
she reported.

        The primary screen showed a burst of static for a moment, then 
an irritable looking Ryouko&#39;s face appeared. &quot;Ryo-Ohki&#39;s sensors have 
recovered enough to show that the Earthers appear to be launching an 
attack on the Moon Kingdom,&quot; she said to them grimly before adding, 
&quot;and they&#39;re doing it using old Juraian ships.&quot;

        &quot;Looks like we&#39;ve come to the right place,&quot; Minagi admitted.

        &quot;We&#39;re moving in to support the Moon Kingdom forces,&quot; Ryouko 
smiled grimly.

        &quot;After we get all the fighters deployed, we&#39;ll be right behind 
you,&quot; Minagi confirmed. Just before Ryouko disconnected Minagi 
grinned, &quot;Good luck!&quot;

        Ryouko grinned back, &quot;Luck is for amatures.&quot; With that, she 
was gone. In seconds Ryo-Ohki was supporting the Moon Kindgom ships, 
laying down a wicked suppresion fire.

        Before Minagi could even ask Rei said, &quot;Yamamoto Yohko reports 
that all fighter pilots are ready to launch.&quot;

        &quot;Then let&#39;s do it,&quot; Minagi grinned, &quot;prepare to drop shields.&quot;

        &quot;Drop shields?&quot; Rhione repeated softly, surprised.

        &quot;Swordbreaker&#39;s been carrying the fighters in it&#39;s shield 
envelope,&quot; Mitsuki explained, &quot;we have to drop shields or they can&#39;t 
get out.&quot;

        &quot;Sensors are back up,&quot;Asuka reported to Minagi as she gave Rei 
a look, &quot;We&#39;re only going to drop the shields a few seconds at most. 
The timing&#39;s got to be perfect.&quot;

        &quot;It will be,&quot; Rei answered cooly.

        &quot;That&#39;s my Rei,&quot; Asuka chuckled. She and Rei tied their 
control systems together, Rei communicating softly with the pilots as 
Asuka prepared.

        &quot;Drop shields,&quot; Minagi ordered.

        Almost simultaniously the seven fighters shot forward, quickly 
escapting the shield envelope and taking up their formation. Three 
were arrayed on each side of a larger, blood red craft.

        On the Swordbreaker&#39;s bridge Yamanoto Yohko&#39;s face appeared. 
Focused and intense she reported, &quot;Ready, ma&#39;am. Request permision to 
move in and engage the enemy.&quot;

        &quot;Tactical update,&quot; Asuka brought the battle up on another 
screen, &quot;the Moon Kingdom forces are badly outnumbered, nearly two to 
one.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;Numerically at least we won&#39;t make that much of 
a difference.&quot;

        Minagi gave a viscious smile, &quot;But we outpower every other 
ship on the battlefield.&quot; She looked up at Yohko, &quot;Let&quot;s try to bring 
everybody home this time.&quot; At the young woman&#39;s grave nod she said to 
her simply, &quot;Go.&quot;

        Yohko lead the charge into the enemy formations, her fighters 
bobbing and weaving madly through the massive wooden ships of the 
enemy forces. Targeting primarily weapons and defensive systems they 
softened up the ships of the enemy line, allowing the Moon Kingdom and 
Ryo-Ohki to pick off the damaged vessels.

        Right behind her Swordbreaker opened up with her main guns, 
throwing waves of power into the enemy fleet. But the Earth ships were 
maneuverable, and only by closing the distance could they guarentee 
the kills.

        &quot;Ryo-Ohki,&quot; Ryouko cried from her own bridge, &quot;another 
barrage!&quot;

        &quot;Myah!&quot; Ryo-Ohki agreed quite cheerfully, throwing another red 
swath of energy that cut an Earth ship in two.

        &quot;Can you open a communications link with the Kingdom?&quot; Ayeka 
asked.

        In seconds a screen opened up, and a very tired looking Lady 
Mercury snapped without looking up, &quot;No I can NOT send you tactical 
support!&quot; She looked up and saw who she was talking to and went beet 
red. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she started.

        Ayeka raised her hand in a calming gesture, &quot;It&#39;s all right. I 
just wanted to inform you that we&#39;ve deployed fighters, so please 
caution your forces to choose their targets carefully.&quot; Her eyes 
widened in alarm as she saw that Mercury was alone in the command 
center and she worriedly asked, &quot;Where&#39;s the Queen?&quot;

        Mercury smiled slightly, &quot;Using her sceptre to shoot down 
enemy ships.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve seen it in action,&quot; Ryouko said with a smile, &quot;it can do 
it.&quot; A devilish smirk, &quot;Amoung other things it&#39;s useful for.&quot;

        Ayeka looked at the smirking Ryouko and the suddenly blushing 
Mercury and sighed, &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to know.&quot;

        Washu stepped up, &quot;Do you need medical or technical assistance 
down there?&quot;

        &quot;Both,&quot; Mercury agreed quite reluctantly.

        Washu met Yume&#39;s eyes, then looked over at Kiyone and Mihoshi. 
&quot;We&#39;ll take a transport sphere down,&quot; she nodded to Mercury and cut 
the transmission.

        &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Ryouko started.

        &quot;I designed that transport bubble myself,&quot; Washu said softly, 
&quot;it can take anything that class of ship can throw at us.&quot; More 
quietly, &quot;The people of the Moon are a proud race. They wouldn&#39;t admit 
to needing help unless they were in grave trouble.&quot;

        &quot;Kiyone, keep an eye on her,&quot; Ryouko ordered.

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Kiyone agreed as she and a suddenly serious Mihoshi 
grabbed medical kits and followed Washu and Yume off the bridge. Not 
long after the scarlet shere detached from Ryo-Ohki, dodging every 
shot as it swiftly dove for the Moon&#39;s surface.

        &quot;It can take whatever they can throw at us,&quot; Ryouko imitated 
Washu almost exactly before continuing in her normal voice, &quot;so why 
are you ducking, Mom?&quot;

        &quot;Better to be safe than sorry,&quot; Ayeka chuckled.

        &quot;Agreed,&quot; Ryouko nodded. She looked out at the mass of enemy 
ships and with a dangerous smile said, &quot;Let&#39;s go do some real damage.&quot;

        Ayeka&#39;s grin almost mirrored hers, &quot;Oh, yes.&quot;

        Mitsuki left Rhione standing to the side of Swordbreaker&#39;s 
large bridge and approached the tactical station. &quot;Are there any 
fighters onboard Swordbreaker itself?&quot; Mitsuki asked Asuka 
tentatively.

        Without looking away from her controls Ayeka snapped, &#39;We&#39;ve 
got two Deathscythes and a Wing Zero in hanger three.&quot;

        Mitsuki turned to Minagi, &quot;Request permission to take out a 
Deathscythe.&quot;

        &quot;I know you&#39;re qualified on the simulators,&quot; Minagi said, 
having obviously read her Galaxy Police personnel file, &quot;but how much 
real experience have you had?&quot;

        &quot;Enough,&quot; Mitsuki answered shortly. Quietly, &quot;Even with our 
technical superiority the odds still don&#39;t favor us. We need every 
ship we can get out there.&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t get yourself killed,&quot; Minagi said to her quietly before 
loudly proclaiming to the bridge, &quot;Permission granted.&quot;

        As Mitsuki was running off the bridge Rhione reached out to 
take her arm, &quot;Be careful.&quot;

        Mitsuki smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;ll try, but this isn&#39;t really a 
situation where careful applies.&quot; She pulled free, and was gone down 
the hallway.

        The halls were eeriely quiet as Mitsuki ran for hanger three. 
She was flung up against the wall as the ships&#39;s shields took another 
hit, but still held firm. &#39;In a Galaxy Police ship, we&#39;d be toast by 
now,&#39; she thought grimly as she keyed the door open.

        &quot;Lights,&quot; Mitsuki commanded as she stepped into the hanger.

        The ships rested in their launch cradles, three sleek vessels 
of destruction. One was edged in silver, two others decorated in 
black. The Deathscythes were sleek, deadly shadows, ready to be 
unleashed against their foes.

        Another blast shook the deck, and Mitsuki decided to be poetic 
later. She clambered aboard, locking herself into the command chair 
and pulling on the flight helmet. &quot;Communications check?&quot; she asked as 
she ran through the preflight checklist.

        &quot;Communications go,&quot; Rei answered back dryly.

        &quot;We&#39;re taking heavy fire,&quot; Asuka came on the line, &quot;but I 
should be able to get a window to launch you in about a minute.&quot; 
Softly she added, &quot;Remember to disengage the locks holding your 
fighter down to it&#39;s cradle.&quot;

        With a blush Mitsuki realized the lock was still engaged, 
&quot;Thank you.&quot; She finished her checklist in under a minute, then held 
her breath.

        &quot;Launch window opening,&quot; Rei started...

        ... then Asuka finished, &quot;Now!&quot;

        A burst of thrust kicked Mitsuki back into her seat as she 
soared out into the darkness of space. Weapons fire nearly tagged her 
right then and there, but a swift turn bought her a moment to get her 
bearings. The display on her console showed her the mass of enemy 
ships, and for just a moment felt a chill, but she banished it.

        &quot;Time to get to work,&quot; Mitsuki murmured before joining the 
fighter squad in harrasing the enemy formations.

        In the Palace of the Moon Kingdom Washu and Yume worked to 
bring the powerful shields that protected the city back on line. Next 
door, Mihoshi and Kiyone had set up a emergency medical station, 
treating the most seriously wounded.

        &quot;How&#39;s the situation look?&quot; Washu asked Lady Mercury.

        &quot;Your ships have turned the tide,&quot; Mercury said in honest 
relief, &quot;it looks like we&#39;re actually going to win this one.&quot;

        &quot;Then we&#39;d better get this shield back on line fast,&quot; Yume 
said grimly.

        Lady Mercury nodded slightly, &quot;A desperate enemy might choose 
to do something drastic.&quot;

        &quot;Exactly,&quot; Washu agreed.

        &quot;Shit,&quot; Mitsuki cursed softly as she saw the damaged ship 
moving on a collision course with the Moon&#39;s surface. She patched the 
information to Yohko, Ryouko, and Minagi and hoped they had a better 
idea than she had.

        &quot;We&#39;re tied up here,&quot; Ryouko growled angrily.

        &quot;Primary weapons are temporarily offline,&quot; Minagi cursed, &quot;our 
secondary batteries aren&#39;t powerful enough.&quot;

        &#39;No time,&#39; Mitsuki thought even as she said over the 
communicator, &quot;I&#39;m going in.&quot; Pulling a turn that would have destroyed 
a fighter in an atmosphere she was off.

        Mitsuki came up alongside the ship, then in a burst of speed 
got ahead of it. She pointed her nose at it&#39;s falling bow and opened 
up, throwing the fighter&#39;s entire stock of missles at the falling 
vessel. Fires bloomed on it&#39;s surface, gasses pouring out into space, 
but it&#39;s fall stayed steady.

        The energy cannons flared to life, Mitsuki threw streams of 
destructive power at it. &quot;Primary weapons over heating, autromatic 
shutdown in...&quot; the computer reported.

        &quot;Override,&quot; Mitsuki barked, knowing the risks she was running.

        The vessel flaked off armor and hull, interior portions 
venting into space. But the core kept on falling. &quot;Second warning, 
catastrophic overheating in the fusion core will occur in ..&quot; the 
ship&#39;s monotone voice reported.

        Mitsuki looked back, knowing there wasn&#39;t much time left. &quot;One 
thing left to try,&quot; Mitsuki sighed. &quot;Emergency thrust, activate,&quot; she 
gave the command, the sudden force of it hammering her back into her 
seat.

        The vessel swelled in Mitsuki&#39;s viewport, then the two ships 
came together...

        THOOM!
