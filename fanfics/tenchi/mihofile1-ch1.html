Before we start, to appreciate or even understand this lemon you should
have at least seen a few episodes of either Tenchi Muyo or Tenchi
Universe. The Mihoshi Files centre around Mihoshi (my favourite character
in anime!), in her early days as a Galaxy Police detective. Enjoy!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Ok............ Let&#39;s see............ Oh Yea! Galaxy Police Detective
First Class Mihoshi, opening file, System Date.... emm... System Date...
Today!&quot;

&quot;This week was a very special week. Last week I graduated from
Galaxy Police Academy, thanks to my Granddad. I love him so much!
We always let me sit on his nee. Come to think of it,
that&#39;s all i did last shore-leave!
What was I saying? Oh yea! A few days ago, I got my first posting at
headquarters, where my granddad works (yay!), and met my best friend in
the whole galaxy, Kiyone!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A large transport ship emerges from the atmosphere of a planet, and
approaches a space station orbiting it. The space station was
Galaxy Police Headquarters. The transport docks at headquarters, and a
walkway attaches itself to the ship. The hatch opens and a large crowd of
people walk off. Right behind them, Mihoshi walks off, she&#39;s loaded
down with luggage. She walks off the ship.... only to get her foot caught
on the door-frame. &quot;Woaaaaaaa!&quot; She crashes to the ground in an explosion
of baggage.

One of the security guards comes over to help her. &quot;Hey miss, you okay?&quot;
&quot;Owwwwwwww. I fell on my face.&quot; She said in her upset, child-like voice.
She picked herself up and started to dust herself off. &quot;Y&#39;know, you
shouldn&#39;t be carrying that much hand luggage, you should use a luggage
transport.&quot; &quot;A what?&quot; &quot;A trolley.&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Don&#39;t be silly! I&#39;m not
going shopping!&quot; With that she picked up her bags and dragged them
away. &quot;I tell ya, the prettier they are, the smarter they ain&#39;t.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a knock on the door. &quot;Come in please.&quot; A woman walks in.
&quot;Ah, Kiyone. Come in. Do you have that report on the Rikkkidan Riots?&quot;
&quot;Yes, sir! Here it is. Turns out that the Juraian crime syndicate was
behind it all.&quot; &quot;Well done, this is good work. Now lets see.. there was
something I had to tell you, ah yes! Your getting a new partner.&quot;
&quot;Partner? I don&#39;t need a partner.&quot; &quot;Now, now, Kiyone. Galaxy Police
rules say that all investigation units must have at least two
detectives attached. And since Hitomi was killed, you&#39;ve been going
it alone. I can&#39;t allow that to go on forever. You understand.&quot;

&quot;Erm....but....Ok sir.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry Kiyone, your up for review soon,
just stick it out, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get promoted.&quot; A timid smile grew
on Kiyone&#39;s face. &quot;Yes sir. Thank you.&quot; She left the room.

She grabbed a coffee and went to her office. It was small, empty, very
clean. There were two desks, connected, and facing each other. Kiyone
sat at her desk, facing away from the window. She sipped her coffee as
she stared at the computer screen, with some crime reports on it.
Something catches her eye on her desk. It was a framed picture, of a
woman, in Galaxy Police uniform. She picks up the picture and strokes
the glass with her hand. A tear forms in her eye. &quot;(Hitomi...the best
friend I ever had.)&quot;

A loud chime comes from the doorway. Kiyone is startled, and her tear
falls onto Hitomi&#39;s picture when she jerks her head towards the door.
She rubs her eyes clean, and goes for the door, and presses a
button beside it. As soon as it opens, an avalanche of suitcases
buries Kiyone. She digs herself out, and finds a blonde haired woman
lying on top of it all. &quot;What the hell?! You are you, what are you
doing here?!&quot; She jumps up and stands to attention.

&quot;I am Galaxy Police Detective First Class Mihoshi, sir!&quot; Kiyone looked
at this mess of a woman for a few seconds before saying. &quot;You don&#39;t
have to call me sir, we&#39;re the same rank. Listen, why are you here
with this stuff?&quot; &quot;Ohh.&quot; She began to root in her hair for something.
After a lot of searching she found a data sheet.
&quot;I have been posted to special investigation unit B23, with
Galaxy Police Detective First Class Kiyone, as of this system date.&quot;
&quot;(SHE&#39;S my new partner?!)&quot; Mihoshi looks around. &quot;Are you Kiyone?&quot;
&quot;This is B23, and I&#39;m only one here.&quot; &quot;So Kiyone&#39;s out then.&quot;
&quot;No. (Jeese, how dumb can you get). I&#39;m Kiyone.&quot;

Kiyone extends her hand to shake Mihoshi&#39;s. &quot;Welcome aboard.&quot;
Mihoshi&#39;s eyes lit up with excitement. She jumped past the suitcases
and hugged Kiyone, much to her surprise. &quot;I&#39;m so happy, my very first
partner, good to meet you Kiyone!&quot; &quot;First partner?!&quot; Kiyone gently
pushes Mihoshi away. &quot;Did you just graduate last week?!&quot;
&quot;Yep! Hee hee!&quot; &quot;How the hell did you get to be a Detective First Class,
so soon after graduation?!&quot; &quot;Ohh.......I&#39;m not allowed say, I promised.&quot;

&quot;Ohh kay.&quot; She sat down at her desk. &quot;(She must be good if she got
to First Class so soon.) That desk is yours.&quot; Mihoshi skipped over
to her chair and sat down. &quot;Hee hee! My very own desk!&quot;
&quot;Your gonna like working special investigations Mihoshi, it gets
very exciting.&quot; &quot;Hee hee hee! I hope it&#39;s not too exciting! I might
wet myself!&quot; &quot;Hee hee...Let&#39;s hope not. (Hope she&#39;s house trained).&quot;
Kiyone looks at the luggage Mihoshi left at the door.

&quot;Have they assigned you an apartment yet?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
&quot;When you get a chance, go to Admin, they&#39;ll sort you out.&quot;
Kiyone starts typing at her computer. &quot;I&#39;ll be done in a sec, then
I&#39;ll show you around.&quot; &quot;Ok! Hey! My TV&#39;s got a keyboard!&quot;
&quot;Huh? That&#39;s not a TV. It&#39;s your computer.&quot; &quot;Com....put...er? What&#39;s
that?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll pretend I didn&#39;t hear that. Now.....I&#39;m finished.
Come on, I&#39;ll show you around this place.&quot;

They walk the corridors and hallways of Headquarters. &quot;This here is
the main plaza. The restaurants, and supply mall are here.&quot;
&quot;Hee hee! This place still seems so BIG! Just like when I was little!&quot;
&quot;You have a relation in Galaxy Police?&quot; &quot;Yep! My Granddad! He raised
me ever since my parents died.&quot; &quot;Ohh....I&#39;m sorry.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry
about it. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re in heaven. I&#39;ll see them sometime.&quot;
&quot;Yea, I suppose so. (A child&#39;s view of death. It&#39;s not surprising
coming from her.)&quot;

&quot;This place is so big! How can you not get lost here?&quot; &quot;Well, the
station is basically broken down into 3 sections, the outer
office area, that&#39;s where our office is, the central core, that&#39;s
where we are, above us are the main offices and admin , where you
want to go to get your apartment assignment, and finally
the apartments themselves, they are on the highest levels of the
station.&quot; &quot;Ok...just a sec.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m writing this down.&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll get a hang of this place soon enough! It&#39;ll
just take time. (I hope.)&quot;

They come into a large control room abuzz with activity.
&quot;And this is the Central Control Room....Mihoshi? Where are
you Mihoshi?&quot; Mihoshi enters the room with a cola drink in her hand.
&quot;Where were you?&quot; &quot;I was getting a drink, this learning stuff makes
me thirsty!&quot; They were on a balcony, over looking this huge computer
room. &quot;You see down there? That&#39;s the central computer, it controls
the entire station.&quot; &quot;Wow! Really?!&quot; She bends over the balcony
rail, and spills her drink on the computer below.
&quot;Mihoshi! NO!&quot;

The computer began short out with bursts of smoke and electricity.
Then the entire system crashed, all the screens went blank, the
lights began to flicker on and off. An alarm could be heard echoing
throughout the station. Then a massive tremor shakes the station,
sending everyone to the ground. The Control Commander gets up.
&quot;REPORT! What happened?&quot; &quot;The docking system is down sir!
A cruiser crashed into a docking port, completely destroying it!
The whole area is decompressing! I can&#39;t seal it off, the entire
system&#39;s gone!&quot; &quot;This is Station Control, any repair crew near
section 23 B 45, attempt a manual section seal.&quot;
&quot;THIS IS REPAIR CREW 23, WE&#39;RE SEALING IT NOW, EVERYONE GOT OUT
ALRIGHT, NO FATALITIES.&quot;

&quot;Excellent, finish the job. Control out. Can ANYONE tell me what
just happened?!&quot; &quot;Sir, it looks like a carbonated liquid got
into a vent grill, shorting the main breaker circuit.
It looks like.....diet cola?&quot; &quot;Where did it get in?&quot;
&quot;Emm.....over there sir.&quot; Said the operator as she pointed
in Mihoshi&#39;s direction. Kiyone sinks her head into her hands.
&quot;Oh Mihoshi... Sorry everyone! It&#39;s her first day!&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A dazed and confused Kiyone walks with Mihoshi down a
corridor. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we got away with that!
What did you say to the commander Mihoshi?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m not aloud say.&quot; &quot;You didn&#39;t do what I think you did?&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t know. What do you think I did?&quot;
&quot;Y...you know, have sex with him?&quot; &quot;Hee hee hee...you said the
&#39;S&#39; word! No, I didn&#39;t do anything naughty. It&#39;s something to do
with incompetence in the police, and cover-up thingy....OPPS!
I&#39;ve said too much!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t understand most of that
anyway.&quot;

They come to a docking port with a large red vessel in dock.
&quot;Hey! Look at that ship! It&#39;s so cute!&quot; &quot;Well. (Cute?) That&#39;s
my ship, Yugami.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s a cute name, did you give her it?&quot;
&quot;No, she was given that name by the ship registry. I think
Yugami was the name of the designer&#39;s mother. Hmm....
Wanna see inside?&quot; Mihoshi&#39;s eyes lit up excitement.
&quot;Really?! Hee Hee!&quot; &quot;Yea, I need you logged into Yukinojo
anyway.&quot;

They get on board Yugami, and head for it&#39;s bridge. They sit
at the control console. &quot;Look at all this! Hee hee!&quot;
&quot;Yukinojo?&quot; A bowl-shaped robotic head descends from the
ceiling. &quot;Yes Detective Kiyone?&quot; it said in it&#39;s metallic
voice. &quot;Yukinojo, this is Detective Mihoshi, she&#39;ll be my new
partner, please log her in.&quot; &quot;At once.&quot; Yukinojo looked at her,
as she stared back at it with wide-eyed optimism. &quot;Pattern
scanned and saved. Detective Mihoshi, please give a password.&quot;
&quot;Hee hee hee&quot; &quot;Please give me a password, Detective.&quot;
&quot;Hee hee hee&quot; &quot;Kiyone? What is wrong with her?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t
know Yukinojo. Mihoshi please give him a password.&quot;
&quot;Hee hee hee! He&#39;s so cute! Hee hee hee!&quot;
&quot;MIHOSHI! GIVE HIM A PASSWORD!&quot; yelled Kiyone as her patience
wore out.

Mihoshi sank into her chair and shyly pressed her index
fingers together. &quot;(sniff)You don&#39;t have to (sniff) yell Kiyone,
I...I (sniff) can hear you ok.&quot; Mihoshi was about to start
crying. &quot;Listen...Mihoshi, sometimes I just crack like that,
I&#39;ve got terrible patience. I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to yell
at you.&quot; A smile grew on Mihoshi&#39;s face after Kiyone showed
kindness towards her. &quot;That&#39;s ok Kiyone, it&#39;s my fault
anyway.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t think that way Mihoshi, listen just give
Yukinojo a password, and we&#39;ll call it day.&quot;
&quot;Ok, emm, password. How about...&#39;There was an old woman who lived
in a shoe&#39;?&quot; &quot;It&#39;ll do, Yukinojo?&quot; &quot;Password saved...&quot;

&quot;Hey I wonder how this thing works?&quot; said Mihoshi as she pulled on
Yukinojo&#39;s head. &quot;NO MIHOSHI DON&#39;T PULL THAT....&quot; She pulled
Yukinojo&#39;s head off of it&#39;s support arm, disabling him.
&quot;Opps...Kiyone...I think he&#39;s broke...&quot; said Mihoshi showing her it&#39;s
broken head in her hands. Kiyone slammed her head on the console
panel in frustration. &quot;We need to fix him Kiyone...&quot;
Kiyone replied in a disheartened voice, all the time
keeping her head on the console panel. &quot;Just...just leave him there,
and go to home to your apartment. I&#39;m just going to cry here for a
while, then go hang myself.&quot; &quot;Emm...OK! See ya in the morning!&quot;
Then she skipped off merrily.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kiyone locked down Yugami, and slowly pulled herself up to the
apartment levels, she reaches her door. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking
forward to this all day.&quot; She presses a button to have the door
slide open, and then staggers in. She wanted to reach the shower,
but instead she collapses on her couch. As a Detective First
Class, Kiyone got a good-sized apartment. It was designed for two,
but Kiyone preferred to live alone, and has been for some time.

&quot;At least I don&#39;t have to see her till morning...&quot; The doorbell
rang. &quot;Ohh, GO AWAY! I&#39;m sleeping.&quot; The bell rang again.
&quot;Alright I&#39;m coming, this better not be that mail order catalogue
again! I don&#39;t buy anything from it so stop calling! It&#39;s full of
tacky shit anyway.&quot; She opens the door only to see Mihoshi, with
her luggage. &quot;(Please don&#39;t be what I think this is.) Mihoshi,
what are you doing here?&quot; &quot;Is this Apartment 82 G 69?&quot;
Sweat ran down Kiyone&#39;s brow. &quot;Y...yes, it is.&quot; &quot;Then this is my
apartment!&quot; A grim complexion came over Kiyone as Mihoshi carried
her load into the apartment, closing the door after.

&quot;There has to be some kind of mistake! I&#39;ve never shared this
apartment with my partners!&quot; Mihoshi gives Kiyone a data sheet,
which she reads. &quot;The girls in the Admin place said I have to come
here because there are no single apartments left, and that I could
stay with you because this apartment was meant for two not just you
on your own! I get to keep you company!&quot; Kiyone clenches the data
sheet.&quot;(I can&#39;t believe this, everyone&#39;s out to get me today.)&quot;
&quot;Oh, this place is nice.&quot; &quot;Alright listen, I try and keep this
place clean, so do the same while your here.&quot;

&quot;Are we gonna be room mates? Hee hee!&quot; &quot;No, you get your own room.
I value my privacy, so don&#39;t come into mine.&quot; &quot;Oh, alright then.
I like you Kiyone! I&#39;m glad we&#39;ll be living together.&quot;
A shiver went down Kiyone&#39;s back. &quot;You unpack, I&#39;m going to
have a shower.&quot;

Kiyone stepped into the bathroom, and slowly began to peel her
clothes off. She stripped naked, and walked into her shower,
closing the curtain around her, something she&#39;s never had to do
before. She pushed a few buttons on the shower control, and
soon a blast of warm water was coming out of the tiles and ceiling.
The water created a massaging effect on Kiyone&#39;s sensitive skin,
and aching muscles.
She loved every second of this. The floor of the shower slowly
rotated as it cleaned her. The stress of the day seemed to wash away
with the dirt.

The floor stopped rotating so the spray could wash Kiyone&#39;s back and
ass. She was now facing the door to the bathroom. Kiyone opened
her eyes for a moment. She was almost falling asleep with the
relaxing effect of the shower. She could see someone come in, it
was Mihoshi. &quot;Mihoshi?! What are you doing in here?&quot; &quot;Just putting
my toothbrush in....woa!&quot; She slipped and pulled down the shower
curtain, she could now see Kiyone&#39;s naked body.

Kiyone lit up bright red when she realised what happened, and
covered her privates quickly. &quot;MIHOSHI! GET OUT!&quot; &quot;This is so
embarrassing!&quot; Said Mihoshi as she covered her eyes.
&quot;YOUR EMBARRESSED?! Your not the naked one here. Now GET OUT!&quot;
&quot;Can I use the shower after you?&quot; &quot;(sigh) Yes, now please get out.&quot;
&quot;Ok. Is it ok if I use your ion cooker?&quot; &quot;Yes...&quot; &quot;Ok bye!&quot;
&quot;Finally! (I need to put a lock there in future. Well...her seeing
me naked could be worse thing that&#39;s happened today, so it couldn&#39;t
possibly get any worse.)&quot;

She tried to relax again as the shower rotated her front towards
the spray again. The spray stopped and an armature came out of the
wall. Kiyone spread her arms and legs in anticipation.
The armature cleaned hard to reach places, first it went for her
armpits, then it cleaned her ass crack. Next was her favourite part.
The armature developed a soft sponge. It then went to her cunt,
and gently cleaned it with warm soapy water.
&quot;Oh mmmmm, I love this....&quot;
Kiyone&#39;s breathing got heavier as she got hot from having
her clit cleaned by the sponge.

She forgot about everything, until... &quot;Ahh yes.....(sniff, sniff)
what&#39;s that smell, smells like something burning.....OH NO!!&quot;
She ran out of the shower, and the bathroom, with out putting any
clothes on and runs into kitchen. It wasn&#39;t as bad as she thought.
Mihoshi had managed to burn something in the ion cooker.
&quot;What are you doing Mihoshi? I smell burning.&quot; &quot;I was trying to
make dinner for us but I didn&#39;t know the settings for it, so I
it set too high. I sorry Kiyone.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s ok. I too tired to eat
anyway.

Mihoshi looked down. &quot;Hee Hee! You&#39;ve cute nipples Kiyone!&quot;
Kiyone just remembered that she was naked, and was about to cover
herself, when she realised that there was no point. She trudged
into the bathroom, turned off the shower, dried off, got her
clothes and came back to the kitchen. &quot;I&#39;m going to bed,
see you in the morning.&quot; &quot;Good night Kiyone! Hee hee!&quot;
Kiyone trudged in the direction of her room with the last
ounces of her strength. She was exhausted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kiyone didn&#39;t bother putting on her night gown, she just stayed
naked. The second her head hit the pillow, she was out cold.
Never before had she had such a difficult partner,
she earned this rest.

She dreamed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

She was on a beach. The sun was beating down.
There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky. On one side was a
tropical forest. On the other a calm, green-blue ocean.
It was warm and mild where she was. She expected to be
wearing her swimsuit. But instead she was wearing her full
Galaxy Police uniform. &quot;(This is so beautiful, but it&#39;s
too hot for this uniform, better take it off.)&quot;

She tries to undo her tie, and open the buttons of her shirt,
but something held it all together, she couldn&#39;t undress.
She started to struggle with the hook of her tie.

&quot;You have to want to take it off Kiyone...&quot; said a woman&#39;s
voice from the forest. &quot;Who said that?&quot; A head emerges from the
shadows. &quot;Don&#39;t you recognise my voice Kiyone?&quot; &quot;Hitomi? Is it
you?&quot; She totally emerged from the shadows, revealing that she
was naked. &quot;Hitomi. It is you.&quot; Hitomi had an athletic build,
and looked very like Kiyone, except that she had much longer
hair which was straight and brunette.

She walked onto the beach and up to Kiyone. &quot;You can&#39;t take off
the uniform, because you don&#39;t want to take it off.&quot;
&quot;But I do, it&#39;s hot, I want to take it off.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve gotten so
used to the uniform, it&#39;s become part of who you are. Let
me help you find yourself.&quot; Hitomi opens the knot of Kiyone&#39;s
tie and slips it off, then throws it towards the water.
&quot;No wait...&quot; &quot;Shh..Kiyone, let it go.&quot; A wave washes the tie
away. Then Hitomi grabs Kiyone&#39;s trousers and shirt at the
waist, and rips them off as if they were made of paper.
Kiyone was now naked. &quot;What the?! My clothes are usually
stronger than that! And my shoes are gone, where&#39;d they go?&quot;

&quot;Your beginning to let go, of your uniform, and showing your
true colours.&quot; &quot;Why don&#39;t I have any panties on?&quot;
Hitomi playfully squeezes Kiyone&#39;s nose. &quot;Hee hee! Panties
aren&#39;t part of who you are! I look at your body now,
and I see who you are, your so beautiful Kiyone, you should
stop hiding yourself.&quot;

Hitomi took Kiyone&#39;s hand into hers, and then smiled at her.
Kiyone&#39;s eyes began to fill tears. &quot;(sniff)H..Hitomi, I&#39;ve
missed you so much.(sniff)&quot; She just smiled some more then led
Kiyone into the forest. They stopped in a grassy clearing.
Kiyone couldn&#39;t resist hugging Hitomi, she was still in tears.
&quot;(sniff) I&#39;ve been so lonely since you died. (sniff) And now
they&#39;ve replaced you with a klutz from Parlamenta. (sniff)
I&#39;m...I&#39;m afraid, I don&#39;t know what to do anymore!&quot;

&quot;Poor Kiyone, your uniform has become a straight jacket for
you. You can&#39;t share your feelings with people anymore.
You were a lot more open with me.&quot; &quot;You were a good friend
Hitomi.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll show you how to relax, and let out your
feelings, the only way I know how.&quot;

Hitomi held Kiyone&#39;s torso, and bent Kiyone&#39;s knees as she
lay her down on the ground. Hitomi then lay beside her,
on her front. &quot;Close your eyes and listen to sound of the
ocean, and forest, and my voice.&quot; She did this.
&quot;Forget about everything that&#39;s causing you pain and
stress. Fall into a trance of pure ecstasy.&quot;
Hitomi then gently began to feel Kiyone&#39;s body with
her fingertips. &quot;Hitomi?&quot; &quot;Shh, just relax and let out
any noise you feel like making. Just turn off, I won&#39;t
hurt you, just let my explore your body.&quot;

Hitomi slid her fingers down to Kiyone&#39;s cunt. She
then began to ease her fingers into her vagina.
&quot;Ohhhh, Hitomi. Wait, I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not.&quot; &quot;Used to this?&quot;
Kiyone nodded her head. &quot;Poor Kiyone, you&#39;ve never had a
lover. Your so beautiful and kind, you deserve so much more.
You must learn to love yourself first, without the uniform,
before you allow others to. Open yourself to me...&quot;

Hitomi started to move her hand around inside Kiyone,
and played with her clit with her thumb. Kiyone
began to sweat, and breath heavily. She was about
to start moaning. &quot;That&#39;s it Kiyone! Let it out!&quot;
She looked at the loving eyes of her dead partner,
and was about to let out a moan just for her, when
something terrible began. She noticed Hitomi&#39;s
hair turn blonde and curly. She looked at her in terror
as her skin began to tan heavily. Hitomi had turned into
Mihoshi. This was now a nightmare for Kiyone.
-----
Kiyone woke up suddenly.

It was no dream. To her utter horror, Mihoshi was standing
over her, sort of sleep walking, with her hand inside
her just like Hitomi in her dream. Kiyone screamed when she
realise that Mihoshi was fingering her. Mihoshi woke up
after hearing this. Only to find her right hand rooted inside
her partner. &quot;Huh? What&#39;s happening?&quot; &quot;YOUR FINGERING ME,
THAT&#39;S WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING!! GET YOU HAND OUT OF ME!!!&quot;

Mihoshi struggled to remove her hand. &quot;It&#39;s stuck!&quot;
Kiyone&#39;s cunt had contracted around Mihoshi&#39;s fingers.
Kiyone got hold of her wrist with both hands and
wrenched her hand out, nearly bringing her to
orgasm. Kiyone had to get her breath back, before she
focused her anger at Mihoshi.

&quot;Who do you think you are, coming in to my room and FINGERING
me while I SLEPT?!!!!&quot; She yelled, getting ready to strangle
Mihoshi. Mihoshi began to cry. &quot;(sniff) I&#39;m sorry Kiyone,
this sometimes happens. I sleepwalk, and do things.(sniff)
I don&#39;t know why! I&#39;m so sorry for doing that naughty thing.
I&#39;ve never done that before.(sniff) Even while I was awake.&quot;

&quot;You never fingered anyone? (sigh) It&#39;s Ok Mihoshi. No harm
was done. Just don&#39;t come in here again. We&#39;ll talk in the
morning. Awww. Please stop crying.&quot; Mihoshi began to stop.
&quot;(sniff)(sniff) Thank you Kiyone. Good night.&quot; She meekly
left the room. &quot;(I wont forget that in hurry)(yawn)&quot;
Kiyone was still exhausted, even more now. She looked at the
clock on bedside locker. &quot;It&#39;s only 3 am. I get a few hours
sleep.&quot; She was asleep before her head hit the pillow.

She dreamt again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

She was on the beach again. This time she was naked, except
now it was night time. She looked around, but there was no-one.
&quot;Hitomi!! Hitomi!! Are you there?&quot; She felt a soft, warm hand
on her shoulder. She turns to see Hitomi again. She hugged
her dead friend. &quot;Oh Hitomi, I missed you for those few seconds
we were apart.&quot; &quot;Kiyone, you shouldn&#39;t be dependant on me.
I feel that someone is on you mind. A young woman.&quot;
&quot;That perverted klutz Mihoshi. Your replacement. I..I can&#39;t
stand her, she&#39;s so chaotic, unorganised, not to mention
childish.&quot; &quot;Hmm. Sounds like a young rookie detective I took
under my wing, some time ago. It took hard work to train her
into a professional. But think she turned out
alright, in the end.&quot; she said as she put her hand on
Kiyone&#39;s shoulder.

A smile grew on Kiyone&#39;s face. &quot;That&#39;s kind of you to say,
you always had confidence in me. But, but Mihoshi is
different, I doubt she even passed the Academy entrance
exam! And I&#39;m not half the teacher you were.&quot;
&quot;Oh Kiyone. Being a police officer isn&#39;t about grades,
it&#39;s about loving people enough to want to protect them.
If her heart is in the right place, like yours is, this
girl can make it. And Kiyone, you don&#39;t give yourself enough
credit, you can be a great teacher, better than any I&#39;ve had.&quot;
&quot;I never thought you anything.&quot; &quot;Oh no? You thought me that
there are people out there worth caring about.&quot;
Hitomi took Kiyone&#39;s hands into her own. &quot;Kiyone your
friendship meant so much to me in my final years.&quot;

A tear rolled down Kiyone&#39;s cheek. &quot;Hitomi....You were
my best friend. Thank you... But, I&#39;m not you. I can&#39;t teach
this girl. It&#39;s so sad Hitomi, she lost her parents when she
was young, I think the trauma kept her mind at the age she
lost them. She&#39;s so innocent, she can&#39;t see evil. She cares
about people, but, her heart is too big for this job.&quot;

&quot;Awww, you care about her.&quot; said Hitomi in doting
tone of voice. &quot;N..no I don&#39;t! She&#39;s very, VERY annoying
and stupid! I want to get rid of her.&quot; &quot;Oh, this
is serious...&quot; Hitomi walks over to one of the trees,
pulls a vine off and comes back to Kiyone.
&quot;Looks like I&#39;ll have to arrest you!&quot; She goes around
to the back of Kiyone, pulls her hands behind her
back and begins to tie her wrists together with the
vine. &quot;Hey! Stop tying me up! Arrest me? On what
charge?&quot;

&quot;Lying to a Galaxy Police Detective, it&#39;s a serious
offence. You do care about that girl. You&#39;ve been lying
to yourself too, so your guilty on two counts. Hee! hee!&quot;
Hitomi finishes the knot, tying Kiyone&#39;s arms together.
She struggles to free her arms for a few seconds, then
gives up and begins to blush. &quot;I suppose your right,
you always are Hitomi. I&#39;ve hidden my feelings too long.
I do kinda like that dumb klutz, she is cute. I should
give her a chance.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s more like it, your letting
your real feelings out now. It&#39;s surprising how much
people will tell you when they&#39;re tied up! Hee! Hee!&quot;

Kiyone blushes even more. &quot;Hitomi, I wasn&#39;t always honest
with you, there&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wanted to tell
you, this might my last chance to say this so....I...
I...Hitomi I...&quot; &quot;Go on Kiyone, you can say it.&quot;
Tears began to flow from Kiyone&#39;s eyes.
&quot;Hitomi, I love you.&quot; Hitomi was stunned. &quot;I&#39;ve
always loved you Hitomi, but I never did anything about,
I never told you how I felt. (Sniff) And now, now your
dead. (sniff) I&#39;ll never see you again. (sniff) I loved
so much! (sniff)&quot; Kiyone broke down into tears.

&quot;Poor Kiyone. I loved you too.&quot; She cradled Kiyone&#39;s
head in her hands, then moved their heads closer.
It wasn&#39;t until their lips touched, did Kiyone knew
that Hitomi was kissing her. She closed her
waterlogged eyes, and felt Hitomi&#39;s thung massage hers.
They kissed for a while. Kiyone had stopped crying.
Hitomi lay Kiyone on the sandy ground. She lay on top
of her. &quot;Hitomi, I&#39;ll never forget you.&quot;
&quot;I know. (I&#39;m a part of you now.)&quot;

Hitomi moved her head down to Kiyone&#39;s cunt, and
began to lick it. Kiyone was loving this,
she began breath heavily again. She tugged at her
binds as waves of pleasure flowed through her body.
Then she began to moan. &quot;Mmmmmm, Oh, (gasp) Hitomi...
I love you....mmmmmmm...thank you, oh, ah, AH!&quot;
&quot;Let it out Kiyone, I&#39;m going all the way...&quot;
She licked hard on Kiyone&#39;s clit. &quot;Oh ah ah ah OH!
AH AH AH AH AH! (gasp) AHHHHHH! AH ah ah ah oh oh
oh ah ah ahahahahahahahahahAHHHHHHHH!&quot;

She came, but Hitomi kept licking. &quot;Oh, Hitomi..
thank you so much.&quot; She looked at her friend&#39;s
head moving up and down. But something was wrong.
Where a brunette head of hair should have been, a
curly blonde head replaced it.
&quot;OH NO! Not again!!!&quot; 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

She woke up again.

She could feel that she was tied up, just like in her
dream, except here, she was tied with a power cable.
Mihoshi was naked and licking her cunt. She
was sleep walking again. &quot;Mihoshi stop!
Untie me NOW! Wake up!&quot; Mihoshi was sound asleep,
and couldn&#39;t hear her. &quot;It&#39;s no use. I can&#39;t
free myself.&quot; She said as she struggled with her
binds. &quot;At least she can tie people up properly.
OHHHH, oh no, not this way, not with her! Ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah mmmm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm MM
MM MM MM MM AH ahahahahahahahahahOHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;

She came again, except now for real. Mihoshi
stopped and lay on top of an exhausted Kiyone.
She stayed asleep, and began to snore into
Kiyone&#39;s ear. &quot;I CANT STAND THIS! (I&#39;m sorry
Hitomi, I don&#39;t have your patience, I can&#39;t
train this &#39;girl&#39;)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Morning, and after yelling at Mihoshi, and
a light breakfast, Kiyone stormed down to
the Chief&#39;s office.

&quot;She&#39;s stupid, incompetent, and she raped me twice in her
sleep last night!&quot; &quot;Yes, we know about her sleeping disorder.&quot;
&quot;I want her off my unit NOW!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not that simple
Kiyone... There are issues regarding Detective Mihoshi.&quot;
&quot;You mean like not passing the academy entrance exam?!&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;What?! Then...then what&#39;s she doing in Galaxy
Police?!!!&quot; &quot;You have no idea who she is, she&#39;s important.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t care if she&#39;s the Crown Princess of Jurai! She has
no business in this force!!&quot; &quot;Her grandfather is the
Grand Marshall.&quot;

Kiyone cooled down for a bit, when it sank in. The grandfather
who had raised Mihoshi from a young age, was the highest ranking
officer in Galaxy Police. &quot;I...I see now, she got in because of him.
She&#39;s a Detective First Class, because of...him.&quot;
&quot;Yes, and this stays between us, this can&#39;t get out.&quot; &quot;Well...
can&#39;t you just, give her to someone else.&quot; &quot;She&#39;s requested to stay
with you, she likes you for some reason, she even had it arranged
to share an apartment with you. I&#39;m sorry Kiyone, request denied.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kiyone walked the corridors of Headquarters, almost lost in her
own thoughts. &quot;That&#39;s it, my carrier&#39;s finished. She&#39;ll ruin me, that
cute little blonde bombshell will ruin me.&quot; She decided to go to
Yugami. Yukinojo would have been fixed by now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;What am I going to do Yukinojo? I can&#39;t get rid of her, she&#39;s the
Grand Marshall&#39;s granddaughter, and she &#39;likes me&#39;. She&#39;s even
invaded my apartment. I&#39;m so stressed I can&#39;t relax anymore.
Any ideas?&quot;
&quot;Well Kiyone, the only way I see out of this, is if you either
commit suicide now, resign from Galaxy Police, or get that
promotion you wanted.&quot; &quot;Well...I&#39;m not going to do the first two,
although I might kill myself before ever resigning, looks like I&#39;ll
have to try for promotion. Grrr! But that isn&#39;t for a long time.
Is there any way to get Mihoshi off the force?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid not. This reminds me of a case 100 years ago, when the
Grand Marshall of the time brought his idiot son into the force,
and posted him at our station at Centralia.&quot;
&quot;But there is no station at Centralia.&quot;
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Just then Mihoshi meekly wanders onto the
bridge with her hands behind her back, she hung her head in shame.
&quot;(Kiyone)&quot; &quot;(sigh) Yes Mihoshi?&quot; &quot;(sniff) I&#39;m really sorry for what
I did last night, and I know I can&#39;t do anything to take it all
back. But the least I could do, is try and make you feel better,
so I got you these.&quot; Mihoshi produces a bouquet of assorted flowers
from behind her back and hands them to Kiyone.

This surprised Kiyone. Mihoshi showing responsibility? A kind smile
came over Kiyone&#39;s face as she smelt the flowers. Her voice now
changed to a kinder tone. &quot;Awww, Mihoshi, that&#39;s so cute of you.
Thank you. C&#39;mon sit down beside me.&quot; Said Kiyone patting the seat
beside her. Mihoshi&#39;s face brightened up as she went to sit.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about tonight Kiyone, you can tie me
up so I can&#39;t rape you, I&#39;ll even look into getting a different
apartment.&quot; &quot;You don&#39;t need to do that Mihoshi, I&#39;ll just get a
lock for my room. Is that ok with you?&quot; &quot;Emm, yea.&quot; &quot;C&#39;mon
cheer up! Give me a smile!&quot; A small one grew on Mihoshi.
&quot;Oh, you can do better than that!&quot; Kiyone starts to tickle
Mihoshi. &quot;Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee! Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; &quot;That&#39;s better!&quot;

&quot;Do you feel better now Mihoshi?&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Yep!&quot;
&quot;You know, I&#39;m beginning to think I misjudged you Mihoshi.
Your not so bad.&quot; Yukinojo butts in. &quot;But Kiyone, earlier
you said she was a...&quot; &quot;QUITE Yukinojo!&quot; &quot;You...you mean you
like me again?&quot; Whimpered Mihoshi with tears of joy in her eyes.
&quot;Yea, I like you. Now, what would you say to some piloting lessons?&quot;
&quot;You mean teach me to fly Yugami?!&quot; &quot;Uh huh.&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! Yay! Thank
you Kiyone!&quot; She gave Kiyone a small hug, before jumping around the
bridge in excitement. &quot;Hee! Hee! Come over here Mihoshi, I&#39;ll show
you the basics...&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yugami slowly and nervously circled Headquarters as Kiyone thought
Mihoshi how to fly it. &quot;Ok, hold this heading and press the orbit
button. This is how you keep circling an object, be it a station,
or planet.&quot; &quot;Hee! Hee! I&#39;m flying!&quot; &quot;Erm, yes. Now, there is your
throttle, use it to increase and decrease your speed.&quot;

Just then Yukinojo come to life. &quot;Kiyone, I&#39;m detecting an error in
the forward radar grid.&quot; &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll fix it. Mihoshi, just hold
this coarse, keep the speed low.&quot; &quot;Aye, aye Cap&#39;n!&quot; &quot;Erm, yes.&quot;
Kiyone gets up from her seat and walks to the front of the bridge.
She crouches down, and opens a panel, then begins to tinker with
the wires and components.

Yukinojo moves his head closer to Kiyone, and speaks quietly to
her. &quot;(Kiyone, why have you changed you perception of Detective
Mihoshi so suddenly?)&quot; &quot;(I&#39;m not sure, I think it&#39;s because she
showed that she cared. Few do that for me. But thinking about it.
She is the Marshall&#39;s granddaughter. That means, if I make her
happy, he&#39;ll promote me, and favour me in the force.)&quot;
&quot;(Are you sure you have that kind of patience?)&quot; &quot;(I think so,
besides, she isn&#39;t that bad.)&quot;

Mihoshi started to play with the control panel. &quot;Hey! What&#39;s
this RED button do?!&quot; &quot;NO MIHOSHI! DON&#39;T PUSH THAT!!&quot;
Mihoshi pushes the button, and Yugami&#39;s orbit began to decay.
The ship was being pulled in by the station&#39;s gravity.
It was hurtling towards a support beam at great speed.

&quot;Ahh!!! Mihoshi! Put on Auto Pilot!&quot; Said Kiyone as she
stumbled towards the control panel. &quot;Emm! Oh no! I don&#39;t
know which! Emm... I know, I&#39;ll push all the buttons!&quot;
With that Mihoshi pushed many buttons frantically.
&quot;AUTO DESTRUCT SEQUENCE ENGAGED, AUTO DESTRUCT IN TEN
SECONDS&quot; &quot;How the hell did you do that?!!!!&quot; &quot;Emm...
I don&#39;t know.&quot; &quot;10.....9.....8&quot; &quot;Move over! I have to stop
this!&quot; &quot;....7......6.....5&quot; Kiyone pushed buttons frantically
to stop the ship&#39;s destruction. &quot;.....4......3......2&quot;
&quot;End Auto Destruct, codeword KIYONE463.&quot;
&quot;.....1.....AUTO DESTRUCT CANCELED.&quot;

&quot;Phew! Now we&#39;re safe!&quot; &quot;Emm....Kiyone!&quot; Whimpered Mihoshi
as she pointed out the forward window. &quot;Huh? OH NO!!!!!!&quot;
The ship crashed into Headquarters, shattering a support
beam, and damaging Yugami. The gravity stops working and
the girls start floating around the bridge. Kiyone was in
shock, she couldn&#39;t believe this was happening. It couldn&#39;t
possibly get any worse, she thought.

&quot;THIS IS TRAFFIC CONTROL. DETECTIVE KIYONE, YOU HAVE
COMMITED AN OFFENCE UNDER SECTION 3 PARAGRAPH 5 OF THE
GALACTIC HIGHWAY CODE. THE CHIEF WANTS TO SEE YOU
IMMEADATLY.&quot; &quot;This has to be the worst day of my life.&quot;
Said Kiyone in a depressed voice as she slumped her head
in disarray. Mihoshi looked on with concern.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Have you ANY idea the kind of damage you caused Kiyone?
You should of known what would happen if you left
Mihoshi alone at the controls!&quot; Kiyone and Mihoshi were
standing together in the Chief&#39;s office.
&quot;Yes sir, it was an error on my part, I was teaching her
to fly my ship.&quot; &quot;As a licensee you have a responsibility
to stay with a trainee, regardless of repair jobs.
I have no choice, but to revoke your licence.&quot;

&quot;Wait! But....without my licence, I can&#39;t fly Yugami, I
can&#39;t follow my cases properly. If I can&#39;t fly a
starship, I&#39;m no use as a detective, I might as well
resign.&quot; said Kiyone, almost crying inside.
Mihoshi could see that this was breaking her up inside,
but Kiyone told her to stay quite for her own good. She
wished she could do something.

&quot;You should have thought of that before doing what you
did. I will cancel your licence, you can also forget
about your promotion.&quot; &quot;But....&quot; Kiyone stopped herself
as her heart went so low that she might as well
be ten feet under.

&quot;(yes sir)&quot; &quot; &quot;WAIT!&quot; Mihoshi couldn&#39;t stay quiet for
much longer. &quot;(Mihoshi don&#39;t, you&#39;ll get in trouble
too.)&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t care Kiyone. Sir, it was my fault.
I pressed the red button, I started the ship to say
&#39;Auto Destruct&#39;. I&#39;ve done all the bad things here,
Kiyone got me out of them.&quot;

Kiyone looked at her partner in disbelief.
&quot;Mihoshi, it&#39;s not that simple, Kiyone has responsibility
for you, I can&#39;t just......I can&#39;t.....it doesn&#39;t matter
to you does it? You&#39;ll bring the Grand Marshall into
this. Fine, Kiyone your licence is on probationary
notice. So much as a parking violation, and it&#39;s
revoked. Oh yes, and you&#39;ll have to impress me
in your review, if you want promotion. Dismissed.&quot;

They left the office. Mihoshi looked at Kiyone with her
unusually happy face. &quot;Mihoshi....you...you saved me.&quot;
&quot;It was nothing. I know how much this police stuff
means to you.&quot; For the first time in a long while a
smile came over Kiyone&#39;s face. She hugged Mihoshi
with all her strength, much to her delight.
&quot;Thank you Mihoshi, thank you so much.&quot; Kiyone could
now see that Mihoshi did understand her, in the end.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;She was so happy when I did that. being a detective is
so important to her. Hee! Hee! She should get out more!
Maybe this weekend we can go out and get to know each
other better? I don&#39;t know. It&#39;ll take some doing.&quot;

&quot;(Yawn) Anyways I couldn&#39;t be happier, Kiyone&#39;s been
a lot nicer to me ever since, (yawn). I&#39;m kind of sleepy
now, so I&#39;m going to turn this off now. (How do you
do this? Woa!) (CRASH)&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Hmm... I don&#39;t know if this one will
work out as a series or not. A positive response
from readers might persuade me to continue with this.

Send your ideas, comments and questions.

Till next time, don&#39;t have weird dreams with dead people
you like, that turn into nightmares with living people you
don&#39;t like. Or something. Hmm...
