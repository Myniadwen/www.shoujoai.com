<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 41 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch40.html">Back to Part 40</a><pre>The shaft of light glittered as the transport sphere
descended, a blue globe glittering like a gem as it
settled to the ground then disappeared silently.
Sailor Star Fighter and Healer stepped forward first,
warily watching for trouble, then Queen Kakyuu of
Kinmoku stepped forward, the redhead smiling slightly.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to be so wary,&quot; Kakyuu murmured to the
black haired Fighter, &quot;we&#39;re at the palace of a close
ally.&quot;

Fighter shook her head, her long ponytail flowing as
she answered, &quot;You can never be too careful, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Healer murmured as the shorter while haired
woman stayed close by her side, &quot;we have to justify
our pay somehow.&quot;

&quot;Healer,&quot; Fighter frowned as Kakyuu chuckled.

&quot;Welcome to the palace,&quot; Queen Serenity smiled, her
long white-blonde hair gleaming, &quot;I hope the trip
wasn&#39;t too difficult?&quot;

Kakyuu smiled as she took Serenity&#39;s hands, &quot;It was
fine. If fact, we were even escorted in by one of your
lovely ships.&quot;

King Endymion nodded, &quot;We sent the Nadesico in case
any isolationist were foolish enough to try to
intercept you.&quot;

&quot;To protect us?&quot; Fighter asked.

&quot;No, to keep them from being destroyed if they annoyed
you,&quot; Endymion teased gently as Kakyuu laughed softly.

In the crowd of dignitaries gathered on the roof to
witness the ceremony, Sakura Kinomoto stood to one
side, her simple dress hugging the seemingly young
sorceress.

&quot;How are the wards?&quot; Tomoyo Daidouji asked, the black
haired woman standing protectively close to her.
Possessed of the powers once belonging to Yue she was
Sakura&#39;s champion and defender, not to mention her
lover.

&quot;The defenses are ready,&quot; Sakura nodded, her brown
hair flowing around her face.

&quot;I&#39;m a little surprised the Sailor SEnshi asked for
our assistance,&quot; Tomoyo confessed, her eyes scanning
the crowd.

&quot;The signing of the treaty between Earth and Kinmoku
is important both literally and symbolically,&quot; Sakura
shrugged, &quot;it&#39;s just the sort of thing the
isolationists hate.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Tomoyo conceded. She smiled slightly, &quot;Have
you talked to Nadesico yet?&quot;

Sakura chuckled warmly, &quot;We were on the vid-phone
yesterday. She seems quite taken with Fudoh, doesn&#39;t
she?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Tomoyo agreed. Their daughter was nearly
bubbling with happiness when she talked about her
friend, and even had asked for advise on how to draw
her out more. She frowned, &quot;I just with Fudoh wasn&#39;t
feuding with the Senshi.&quot;

&quot;It does complicate matters,&quot; Sakura admitted as they
watched the Senshi each greeting the foreign queen.

&quot;Maker,&quot; Kakyuu smiled as the third Star SEnshi bowed
to her, &quot;you&#39;ve done well, negotiating the treaty.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m honored to serve, my queen,&quot; Sailor Star Maker
bowed, her brown hair flowing in it&#39;s simple ponytail.

Kakyuu looked amused as she whispered, &quot;And what&#39;s
this I hear about you and Jupiter?&quot;

Maker blushed, &quot;This isn&#39;t really the time.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Kakyuu conceded, &quot;but I want to hear all
about it later.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Maker sighed.

&quot;Nice to see you getting grilled for a change,&quot; Makoto
Kino murmured to Maker after a moment, the tall brown
haired woman chuckling softly.

Minako Aino paused as the blonde touched her ear,
listening to the implant just under the skin there.
&quot;Near miss,&quot; she whispered to the queen softly as
photos flashed off the whole group.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Serenity asked as she maintained her
perfect smile for the cameras.

&quot;An Isolationist attack was intercepted by Major
Motoko,&quot; Mina revealed, keeping her own perfect smile
in place, &quot;we stopped them with no casualties.&quot;

&quot;We really need to take steps,&quot; Miki Kaoru noted, the
blue haired executive and government minister looking
handsome in his suit.

&quot;You&#39;re just annoyed they took a short at Nanami,&quot;
Juri Arisugawa noted, the orange haired warrior
staying close to her wife Setsuna Meiou.

&quot;Juri,&quot; SEtsuna chided gently as she said, &quot;you were
as upset as anyone else when you heard about that.&quot;

&quot;So where is the charming wife?&quot; Touga Kiryuu asked,
the red haired man smirking in his military styled
garb.

&quot;She&#39;s a little too far along in her pregnancy to feel
comfortable running around town,&quot; Miki admitted,
&quot;though she&#39;s monitoring us live.&quot;

Nearby, the youngest members of the group gathered
together to talk as they watched the ceremony unfold.
Ran Mizuno smiled slightly, her short blue hair
flowing around her face as she ask, &quot;Why are they
signing the treaty on the palace roof?&quot;

&quot;You have to admit it has a dramatic touch,&quot; Usagi
noted, her long pink hair gleaming as her white dress
shimmered in the sun.

&quot;But on the security end it&#39;s a nightmare,&quot; Ran
frowned, her military training making her decidedly
nervous about the situation.

&quot;You don&#39;t think Minako can handle it?&quot; Hotaru Tomoe
challenged, the black haired woman giving Ran a
withering look.

&quot;I&#39;m sure Minako will do everything in her power,&quot; Ran
answered, deliberately restraining herself, &quot;but there
are a lot of things that could go wrong that are out
of her hands.&quot;

Erica Tenoh shook her head, &quot;And there they go again.&quot;

Hotaru paused, then sighed. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she admitted,
&quot;reflex.&quot;

&quot;You two really need to fight each other in the
training room,&quot; Usagi said, &quot;maybe get it out of your
systems.&quot;

&quot;I doubt even that&#39;d do it,&quot; Erica shook her head
wryly. Silently she wished Catrine were here, but this
event was for high level diplomats only.

&quot;Incoming,&quot; Ran warned.

Utena Tenjou and her bride Anthy finished their
greeting, then the group walked towards the waiting
platform with the documents. Each took turns signing
pages, formally sealing a alliance between the two
alliances of planets.

Queen Kakyuu smiled as she addressed the crowd, &quot;Today
marks the beginning of a new era of cooperation
between our worlds, and a continuing commitment to
peace in our galaxy.&quot;

&quot;Tell that to the League of Non-aligned worlds and
Mesa,&quot; Ran muttered under her breath.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Erica elbowed her in the side.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Hotaru noted, &quot;the Khanite hasn&#39;t been
exactly a beacon of peace either.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Ran conceded.

&quot;And,&quot; Queen Serenity spoke after giving the band of
girls a wry look, &quot;this cements a long standing
friendship between our peoples. Long may it endure.&quot;

&quot;Busted,&quot; Usagi muttered as the ceremony wound down.

&quot;We&#39;re in trouble later?&quot; Ran guessed.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Hotaru sighed.

To be continued...

Notes: Wanted to touch on Sakura and Tomoyo again, and
I like the idea of Sakura being a powerful mystic.</pre>
