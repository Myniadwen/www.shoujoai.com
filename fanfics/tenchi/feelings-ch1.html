The story-
The feelings that I can&#146;t keep it any more; I love you

------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a beautiful day at the Maski household. The birds was singing 
and chirping. The cherry blossoms were dancing to the ground. It was a 
nice and warm day, the sun was shining it rays on top of the Maski 
lake. The lake was clam, while twinkling away with the rays of the 
sun. Yes it was a nice and peaceful day. But it wasn&#146;t for long&#133;.

&#147; Miss Ryoko! How dare you lay a hand on My Tenchi!!&#148; said the first 
crown princess of Juri. They call her by the name of princess Ayeka.

&#147; YOUR Tenchi!! I don&#146;t see YOUR name on it brat!&#148; said the first 
class space pirate. Her name was Ryoko, the space pirate.

&#147;You know that me and lord Tenchi is distend to be together and live 
happily ever after! With out your corpse being on top of him all the 
time!!!&#148; said Ayeka, rather ticked off.

&#147; DISTEND!?!?! DISTEND MY FOOT!! THE ONLY DISTENY YOU HAVE IS TORWARDS 
THE GRAVE!!&#148; said Ryoko while powering up her energy sword ready to 
attack the princess.

&#147;OH YA!&#148; said Ayeka while powering up as well.

&#147;YA!&#148; said Ryoko tightening her fists to hold the energy sword she was 
creating.

 Logs where starting to appearing around Ayeka, while Ryoko was 
leaping into the air, holding her energy sword into the air as well, 
aiming towards Ayeka while dropping down next to her trying to hit her 
with the beam sword. But the shield that protected Ayeka, didn&#146;t do 
any damage, nor made her flinch.

&#147; AAAARRRRR!!&#148; said Ryoko, trying to break throw the shield.

&#147; HAHAHA&#133;. try as hard as you want, you will never break my shield 
pirate!&#148; said Ayeka in her mocking tone of hers.

&#147;AAARRRRRRGGGGG!!&#148; Ryoko was sweating already with her effort she is 
making, trying to break the shield.

With a few minutes later, Ryoko finally broke the shield that was 
protecting Ayeka.

&#147; *gasp* What?&#148; said a shocked Ayeka.

With the force that Ryoko had broken Ayeka shield. Ayeka went flying 
back towards the tree. Making her scream with pain that was going 
towards her back. Ryoko was walking towards Ayeka with an evil smile 
across her face, while holding her energy sword in mid air. Ayeka was 
terrified that what she thought the pirate was gone to do to her now.

&#147; So? Princess? Thought that I would not be able to break the shield? 
Oh well too bad that you wont have enough time to answer that...&#148; said 
Ryoko in her evil tone that never thought possible.

&#147;What are you saying Ryoko?&#148; Ayeka said, who was quit scared by the 
voice that Ryoko was making.

&#147;I&#146;m saying &#133; SEE YOU IN HELL!&#148; with that Ryoko held her sword high up 
in the air, and was about to swing it at Ayeka&#133; but stopped. Ryoko saw 
something there. Something that she would never see except through 
Tenchi &#133;and&#133; her once true love&#133;

&#147;Nagi&#133;&#148; whispered Ryoko throw her lips that wasn&#146;t holding a evil grin 
anymore.
 
Ayeka looked at Ryoko. Ryoko looked at Ayeka. Through the their eyes &#133; 
they both seemed to see the same thing&#133;but Ayeka saw this a long time 
ago through Ryoko eyes. She only wished she could get the courage out 
of her and tell her those words that was in deep with held inside of 
her heart.

&#147;Arrgg...&#148; Ryoko was trying to focus but failed&#133; her heart got the 
best of her&#133; with that she made the energy sword disappear through her 
hand. Ryoko turned around, and went of towards that Maski household.

Ayeka looked at her, while Ryoko was walking off towards the house.

&#147;See you inside Ayeka&#148; said Ryoko while waving a hand.

&#147;Yes &#133; my love&#148; whispered Ayeka.

------------------------------------------------------------------

THE MASKI HOUSHOLD

Inside the Maski household, every one was having a nice dinner that 
was made by Sasami, the second princess of Juri. Also the little 
sister of Ayeka. There was Tenchi Maski, the son of Nobiyuki and 
Achika. Nobiyuki was currently out on a business trip. Achika, the 
mother or Tenchi, died along time ago when Tenchi was only a child. 
There was Yosho, the grandfather of Tenchi and the Shinto priest of 
the Maski shrine. There where also the two GP officers, by the name of 
first class detective Mihoshi and first class detective Kiyone. Who 
worked together as partners fighting crime. But Kiyone wasn&#146;t quit 
pleased being partners with the ditzy blonde. And there was Washu. Who 
liked to be called little Washu. She was the number scientific guineas 
in the universe. And finely, Ryo-oki, the cabbit of the house. She was 
also the space ship of Ryoko&#146;s. 

All of them was sitting around the dinner table; surrounding by 
delicious food that Sasami made for them as well as her self. 

&#147;Hmmmm&#133;. smells good Sasami! You really out done your self this time!&#148; 
said Tenchi in his kindness manner, while sniffing the food, on his 
plate.

&#147;Really Tenchi? You think so?&#148; said Sasami in her cute voice, with her 
blue eyes shinning with her joyful life.

&#147;Really Sasami&#133; I wish I could cook like you.&#148; Said Tenchi with his 
deep dark brown eyes that are kind like his smile.

&#147;Thanks Tenchi!&#148; said Sasami being her joyful self, while sitting next 
to Washu.

All of them started eating quietly and were enjoying the food that 
Sasami had made.

Tenchi was talking to them about what had happened to him in school 
today. But some people was not quit listening to him&#133;

&lt;What happened to me? Why did I stop? Why did she remind me 
of&#133;Nagi?...what is this I&#146;m feeling for Ayeka? I spouse too feel hate 
towards her not&#133;&gt; Ryoko was in deep thought&#133;and Ayeka had notice this.

&lt;Why I cannot tell her? I want to tell her those three words but&#133;I can 
not&#133;I do love lord Tenchi but not the way I feel the same way towards 
Ryoko&#133; but if I tell her? &#133; Would she feel the same way about me? &gt; 
Ayeka was all so in deep thought with her feelings that she was 
feeling towards the space pirate.

&#147;Hey Ayeka? Is anything wrong? Don&#146;t you like my food?&#148; said Sasami 
seeking the answer form her sister.

&#147;Oh no Sasami! I am very happily enjoying your excellent food, I was 
just thinking about something that&#146;s all&#133;&#148; said Ayeka taking another 
bite out of her food.

&#147;Ok! Just don&#146;t think too much! Or else your food will get cold.&#148; Said 
Sasami, wiping the worried expression of her face, by replacing it 
with her gentle face.

Tenchi looked at Ayeka then Sasami, then towards Ryoko.

&lt; I wonder what those two are thinking? It looks like they are in deep 
thought by the looks of it&gt; it didn&#146;t hold much attention towards 
Tenchi; he just quickly left it behind him, and resumed talking about 
his day after taking another bit out of his food.

There was all so another person who was in deep thought as well about 
her partner, she was sitting next too. 

&lt;Oh ok she staring at me again&#133;why is Mihoshi keep doing that now? ... 
It looks like she in love&#133;*gasp*&#133; no it can&#146;t be&#133; it must be something 
else&gt; Kiyone thought about this&#133;while taking quick glances of her 
partner if she was still staring at her.

&lt;Oh Kiyone&#133;how long I wish too just touch those soft lips of your&#133; but 
I know that can&#146;t ever happen between us&#133; your so beautiful and I&#146;m 
not&#133; you deserve someone better&#133;&gt; with that Mihoshi started to shed a 
tear form one of her blue eyes and soon, started to cry. Kiyone 
noticed this.

&#147;Mihoshi? Is there something wrong?&#148; said Kiyone a bit concerned about 
the blond detective.

&#147; Oh&#133;*sniff*&#133; no there&#146;s nothing wrong Kiyone&#133;its just something in my 
eye, that&#146;s all.&#148; And after that sentence she quickly turned to face 
her food.

Kiyone wasn&#146;t buying it, and for second there she thought she had 
notice a blush on Mihoshi. But thought she was seeing things.

&#147;Ok&#133;if anything&#146;s wrong you can tell me Mihoshi.&#148; Mihoshi nodded once, 
and began to eat her food quietly, and also Kiyone resumed eating her 
food as well quietly, while listening to Tenchi.

------------------------------------------------------------------

SOMEWHERE IN SPACE

There was a woman in side of her space ship, sitting in the commanders 
control seat, holding in her hand was a wine glass, with the fine red 
wine inside of it, matching her cold crimson eyes. She had her black 
cloak around her body showing only her legs which where cross-legged. 
She was swirling her glass around in her long slender fingers. She was 
looking at her screen with the pitcher of Earth on it.

&#147;Soon&#133; very soon&#133;I will finely claim you...Ryoko...not for your 
head&#133;for your heart&#133;my love&#133;&#148; Nagi said with one of her evil smirk of 
hers. She was known as the fearsome bounty hunter known in the 
universe.

 &#147;Cheow!&#148; said ken-okie, her space ship that was also a cabbit.

&#147; Five minutes later towards to Earth? &#133; Excellent &#133; can&#146;t wait to see 
your face Ryoko &#133; I will have you &#133; even it takes my pride and life &#133;I 
will have you &#133; my dear sweet Ryoko &#133;&#148; said Nagi, taking a sip of her 
wine, still having that grin.

------------------------------------------------------------------

MEAN WHILE AT EARTH

&#147; Well I better get going to bed now, it&#146;s getting late, I got school 
tomorrow in the morning, night.&#148; Said Tenchi, with one yawn he headed 
off towards upstairs where his bedroom is.

&#147; Good night Tenchi!&#148; said every one while still watching TV.

All the girls were watching the TV, they were watching there favourite 
show, the soaps.

&#147; Sasami, I think its time for your bedtime as well.&#148; Said Ayeka; 
trying to be the best sister she could be for Sasami.

&#147; Oooohhhhh&#133; but&#148; whined Sasami.

&#147;No buts. Now what kind of sister I would be letting you sleep late?&#148; 
said Ayeka, by cutting Sasami off.

&#147;Ooohhh&#133; ok, I&#146;ll go to bed now. Good night every one.&#148; Said Sasami as 
she was getting up.

&#147;Good night Sasami.&#148; Said everyone not taking their eyes off the TV.

A half an hour had passed and the soaps had finished. In the room, all 
was remaining Ayeka, Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Kiyone. Washu left a few 
minutes later when Sasami had left.

&#147; *Yawns*  yum yum yum&#133;&#148;  yawned a tired Mihoshi.

&#147;Yeah its getting pretty late&#133;I think we should go to bed, we gone to 
go and patrol the solar system tomorrow in the morning so we need to 
go and get some sleep.&#148; Said Kiyone towards Mihoshi while getting up. 

&#147; Ok Kiyone!&#148; said Mihoshi, still acting the same old cheery bubbly 
self.

Kiyone and Mihoshi went up stairs together towards their room that 
they where staying in.

&#147;Good night guys, don&#146;t stay up too late&#133;&#148; with that they went off.

&lt;Yes finally, me and Ryoko, alone, maybe I can tell her form all these 
years I felt towards her&gt; thought Ayeka.

&lt;Oh damn! It&#146;s me and the princess alone! &#133; I hope she won&#146;t start 
another stupid fight of hers! &gt;

&lt;Its now&#133;or never&#133;&gt; thought Ayeka

&#147;Ryoko&#133;&#148;started off Ayeka.

&#147;Yes? Princess?&#148; said Ryoko, turning her face towards Ayeka.

&#147;What happened today&#133;&#148; said Ayeka

&#147;Oh yeah&#133;well Ayeka I&#146;m sorry about that&#148; said an apologising Ryoko.

&#147;Oh no Ryoko&#133;I&#146;m the one who should be apologising to you, I&#146;m the one 
who started the fight, and I never meant to get so carried away&#133;&#148; said 
Ayeka, while shedding a tear, form her purple eyes.

&#147;No Ayeka, I&#146;m the one who got carried away, I hurt you Ayeka, and 
what&#146;s even worse I was about to hurt you even more&#133;&#148; said Ryoko, 
while approaching Ayeka, then took a seat next to her. &#147;I&#146;m sorry 
Ayeka&#133;&#148; said Ryoko, whipping the tear off Ayeka with her finger.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry&#133; Ryoko&#148; said Ayeka, bursting in to tears.

&#147;Ayeka please don&#146;t cry&#133;&#148; said Ryoko by taking Ayeka into her arms for 
a good hug.

Both of them sat on the couch, giving each other the comfort they 
desire. After a good five minutes, one of them spoke.

&#147;Ryoko&#133;*sniff*&#148; said Ayeka, trying to stop the tears.

&#147;Yes? Ayeka?&#148;said Ryoko also trying to stop the tears that threatens 
her.

Both now facing each other.

&#147;I know this gone to sound strange but&#133;how &#133; do you feel about&#133;me?&#148; 
said Ayeka now looking the other way, not daring to face Ryoko in the 
eyes.

&#147;Ayeka&#133;&#148;said Ryoko, not knowing what else to say.

&#147;Never mind Ryoko, it was a silly question to ask you that&#133;good night 
Ryoko.&#148; And with that, Ayeka left towards upstairs.

&#147;&#133;Night&#133;&#148;whispered Ryoko, still shocked what Ayeka had said.

------------------------------------------------------------------

UP ON THE MASKI ROOFTOP

On the rooftop, there was someone crying, not very loud, but you could 
still hear it, through the quit night that held stars in the blue and 
black night sky.

&#147;Why can&#146;t I say it to her? &#133;&#148; said Ayeka, who couldn&#146;t sleep. Not 
after by making a fool out of her self, front of Ryoko.

&#147;She probliy won&#146;t feel the same way about me, she loves Tenchi, not 
me&#133; she won&#146;t ever love me&#133;&#148; after that she burst out crying, but 
carefully not to wake up the house. She turned to face the stars, 
tears still rolling down her cheeks. 

&#147;&#133;I love you Ryoko&#133;&#148; She saw a shooting star through the night sky, 
she closed her eyes and made a wish.

&lt; I wish that Ryoko will love me&#133;&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------

SOME WHERE IN THE FOREST (sorry trying to get back your attention form 
you lot)

Stepping out of the darkness, she approached the stone path, which was 
heading towards the Maski household.

&#147;Where finally here&#133;&#148; said Nagi in her fearsome voice.

&#147;Cheow&#133;&#148; said ken-oki who turned back to its cabbit stage.

&#147;It won&#146;t be very long Ryoko my sweet&#133;&#148; said Nagi with her cruel 
smiles.

Nagi covered her head with her black hood and began to move like the 
cheater, with out making a single noise throw the air. After a few 
minutes later, she finally reached the house. She stopped. Hiding 
behind a tall thick tree at the end of the stone path. She was looking 
if the cost was clear. She was about to make a step forward, she 
stopped. Distracted by the princess on the rooftop she was curies.

&lt; Why is the princess is sitting on the rooftop alone? Is that crying 
I&#146;m hearing? Maybe I should talk to her, she looks like needs to talk 
to someone, but&#133; that will ruin my plans&#133;awww what the hell? You only 
live once?&gt; And with that, she stealthy ran towards the Maski house, 
and climbed the gutter pipes, and leapt in top the air, landing behind 
the princess with out her knowing that Nagi is there behind her. The 
princess was still crying, Nagi felt a bit sorry for the princess. She 
approached Ayeka, looked down at her, and put her hand on the princess 
shoulder.

&#147;W-what?..Whos there?&#148; said Ayeka who was a bit startled by the touch.

&#147;Hello princess&#133;&#148; said Nagi, only this time not using her mocking 
tone, in fact&#133;the tone sounded&#133; caring.

&#147; *gasp* &#133;Nagi&#133;&#148; said Ayeka who turned around, and was surprised to 
see who it was. 

&#147;Yes Ayeka its me&#133;do not be afraid, I&#146;m not her to hurt you or any one 
else.&#148; Said Nagi, while taking a seat next to the princess.

&#147;Then why are you here? Surly you&#146;re here to take Ryoko away form m&#133;I 
mean form us.&#148; Said Ayeka who stopped just in time to make Nagi not 
notice.

&#147;If I was here to take Ryoko away form you, I would of done it a long 
time ago&#148; said Nagi as she watched the stars.

&#147;Then why are you here?&#148; said Ayeka who was getting a bit curies.

&#147;I&#146;m here to visit Ryoko, to tell her something.&#148; Said Nagi, still 
watching the stars.

&#147;And that maybe&#133;&#148;said Ayeka, who wanted to know the answer.

&#147;Sorry princess, but I think I tell you that piece of information 
later&#133;&#148; who smiled a little.

Ayeka turned to watch the stars with Nagi. After a few minutes of 
silence, Nagi felt something hit on her shoulder. She turned around to 
see what it was, but found the princess fast asleep on her shoulder. 
Nagi smiled, those rare caring smiles of hers. She gently picked up 
Ayeka into her arms, she looked into the window, seeing her little 
sister there fast asleep.

&lt;Maybe that&#146;s her room&gt; thought Nagi.

Nagi slowly approached the window, sliding it open with her foot, 
trying not to drop Ayeka. She went inside, saw the empty futon, she 
laid Ayeka in it, and covering her up with the covers. She was about 
to leave, when something touched her shoulder. She turned around to 
see who it was. Sasami.

&#147;What you doing her Nagi?&#148; said Sasami, who was fully awake.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry little girl but can we talk out side? Your sister is 
sleeping.&#148; Said Nagi.

&#147;Sure&#133;&#148;said Sasami, who went off to the balcony. 

Nagi shut the door behind her, not trying to wake up the princess. 
When she completely shut the door, she approached Sasami, who was 
looking at the sky.

&#147;So Nagi? &#133;What brings you here?&#148; said Sasami turning her face towards 
the hunter.

&#147;I&#146;m here to tell Ryoko something&#148; said Nagi, Sasami looked at her, 
who was wondering what it might be.

&#147;Do you want to tell me?... You don&#146;t have to if you don&#146;t want to.&#148; 
Said Sasami, who acting the caring person she always was.

&#147;No, it seems I can trust you, you promise that you won&#146;t tell no 
one?&#148; said Nagi was facing the young princess.

&#147;Promise&#148; said Sasami who was all ears.

&#147;I&#146;m here to tell Ryoko that, I&#146;m no longer trying to kill her&#133;&#148; said 
Nagi, who turned her face towards the stars.

&#147;Is that all?...&#148; said Sasami, who wasn&#146;t completely convinced.

&#147;No, and I all so want to tell her that&#133;that&#133;I&#133;love her&#133;&#148; said Nagi, 
who closed her eyes after those words she had said.

&#147;Nagi&#133;I don&#146;t know what to say, but, good luck&#148; said Sasami with a 
heart-warming smile.

&#147;Thank you, Sasami.&#148;Said Nagi, with a smile returned back to the young 
princess.

&#147;Nagi? Have you got any where to stay for the night?&#148; said Sasami, 
changing the subject.

&#147;Nope expect, Ken-oki&#148;said Nagi

&#147;Well what about if you stay here for the night?&#148; said Sasami with her 
smile.

&#147;Are you sure?... I don&#146;t want to impose&#148; said Nagi

&#147;Don&#146;t worry! Its no problem, I&#146;ve got a extra futon, and there&#146;s 
plenty of room in me and my sis room.&#148; Said Sasami, going back to her 
giggle old self.

&#147;Thank you Sasami, your such a nice person, I wish there&#146;s more people 
like you out there.&#148; Said Nagi, now patting gently on Sasami&#146;s head.

------------------------------------------------------------------

THE NEXT MORNING

&#147; *Yawns * mmm&#133;such a beautiful morning, funny, Ryokos not here to 
give me her good morning of hers.&#148; Said Tenchi while stepping out in 
the balcony to take a deep breath of the morning freshness. &#147; Aaaww 
well&#133; why am I complaining&#133; at least there&#146;s one morning she&#146;s not 
trying to seduce me.&#148; Said Tenchi turning back to go to the bathroom. 
&#147;Better get ready for school, don&#146;t wanna be late.&#148; And with that he 
shut the door behind him of the balcony&#146;s.

------------------------------------------------------------------

IN AYEAKS AND SASAMI&#146;S ROOM

&#147;Mmmmm&#133;. huh? &#133; How did I get in to my futon?... was I dreaming all of 
that? &#133; But it looked so real&#133;&#148; said Ayeka to no one particular.

&#147;Oh well, guess I better get ready for today, maybe this time I can 
tell Ryoko how I feel about her&#148; and with that Ayeka went to the 
bathroom that she shared with Sasami.

------------------------------------------------------------------

AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE

In the kitchen, Nagi was sitting quietly at the breakfast table, 
sipping her tea. While Sasami was cooking the breakfast for everybody. 
While this, there was two very happy cabbits sitting in the corner 
chatting away, sharing their carrots together.

&#147;Good morning every one!&#148; said Tenchi doing his daily greetings.

&#147;Good morning Tenchi! Had a nice sleep?&#148; Said Sasami, doing her daily 
greetings as well.

&#147;Yeah I did, thanks&#148; said Tenchi still looking at Sasami.

&#147;Good morning Tenchi&#148; said Nagi while taking another sip of her tea.

&#147;Nagi!...what are you doing her?&#148; said Tenchi, a bit startled.

&#147;Relax Tenchi, she&#146;s only here visiting, that&#146;s all.&#148; Said Sasami.

&#147;Is that all? Whys that?&#148; said Tenchi not completely convinced.

&#147;Because Ken-oki there wanted to see Ryo-oki, that&#146;s all.&#148; Said 
Sasami, making sure not to tell Nagi&#146;s secret.

&lt;Nice save&#133;&gt; thought Nagi.

&#147;Oh ok, good morning to you Nagi&#148; said Tenchi.

&#147;Good morning&#148; said taking another sip of her tea.

&#147;So Sasami where&#146;s the others?&#148; said Tenchi

&#147;Mihoshi and Kiyone are gone to portal the solar system, and Washu 
said she eat her breakfast later because she&#146;s doing one of her 
experiments and don&#146;t want to be disturbed and Ryoko and Ayeka are 
still up in their rooms.&#148; Said Sasami going back to her cooking.

&#147;Oh ok&#148; Tenchi looked at his watch and said &#147; Oh no! I&#146;m late! I&#146;m 
sorry Sasami but I have to skip Breakfast!&#148; and with that Tenchi ran 
off.

&#147;Tenchi wait!&#148; said Sasami holding Tenchi&#146;s lunch.

&#147;Yes Sasami!?&#148; said Tenchi stopping before he went to school.

&#147;You forgot your lunch&#148; Said Sasami

&#147;Thanks!&#148; Tenchi grabbed his lunch, and ran off again.

&lt;Interesting&#133;&gt; thought Nagi finishing her tea.

With a few minutes later, Ayeka had came down the stairs, noticing 
Nagi, it wasn&#146;t a dream last night. Taking a seat next to Nagi she 
said

&#147;Good morning Sasami, Nagi.&#148; While sitting down.

&#147;Good morning Ayeka! Slept well?&#148; said Sasami, doing the finishing 
touches on the breakfast she was making.

&#147;Very thank you&#133;&#148; said Ayeka.

&#147;Good morning princess&#148; Said the hunter.

&#147;Good morning, by any chance? Was you the one who placed me in my 
futon?&#148; said Ayeka facing towards Nagi.

&#147;Yes it was, you fell asleep on my shoulder, so I brought you back 
towards your room.&#148; Said Nagi, not cracking a smile.

&#147;I thank you for that&#148; said Ayeka, doing a little bow.

&#147;Think nothing of it&#148; said Nagi, now showing a caring smile.

And with that, Ryoko showed up.

&#147;Good morning&#133; every&#133;Nagi!&#148; said Ryoko powering up a beam sword.

&#147;Ryoko stop that! She&#146;s only her because Ken-oki wanted to see 
Ryo-oki.&#148; Said Sasami, while putting the plates down on top of the 
table.

&#147;Oh&#133;I see&#133;well, morning to you Nagi&#148; said calming down a bit, sitting 
opposite Ayeka.

&#147;Morning&#148; said Nagi, with her smile replacing with a smirk.

&#147;Good morning Ayeka&#148; said Ryoko with a smile.

&#147;Um&#133; Good morning Ryoko.&#148; Said Ayeka with a little smile and a blush.

&#147;Breakfast is served!&#148; said Sasami putting the breakfast on to the 
table.

IN SPACE

In space, Kiyone and Mihoshi was patrolling around the solar system, 
in Yagami. The space ship that they do mostly their work in. Inside 
the ship, both of them were sitting in their seats. Kiyone doing some 
files on the computer, while Mihoshi was staring at her again.

&lt;Ok she&#146;s staring at me again, what is it?&#133; Is there some thing on 
face?! &#133; Well I don&#146;t know, but I&#146;m gone to find out!&gt; and with that 
Kiyone said.

&#147;Is something wrong Mihoshi? Lately you&#146;ve been watching me, are you 
sure theres nothing wrong? You can tell me Mihoshi?&#148; 

&lt; *sighs * Its now or never&#133;&gt;

&#147; Kiyone?&#148; said Mihoshi, looking at the teal-haired women eyes.

&#147;Yes Mihoshi?&#148; Said Kiyone who stared back.

&#147;There is something I wanted to tell you, but it&#146;s quit hard&#148; said 
Mihoshi, turning towards the window that showed Earth.

&#147;Well you can tell me anything Mihoshi&#148; said Kiyone.

&#147;Well I&#146;ve been meaning to ask you that&#133; how do you&#133;I mean&#133; feel

&lt;Wow! Did she just say that? Well she&#146;s ok I mean, she nice, caring, &#133;

towards her? Well we have to find out. &gt;

&#147;Mihoshi&#133;I don&#146;t know what to say&#133;&#148; said Kiyone, while getting up, 
approaching towards the blond Detective.

&#147;Its ok Kiyone, you don&#146;t have to say anything, you&#146;ve ready gave my 
answer&#148; said Mihoshi, who was starting to cry.

&#147;No Mihoshi&#133; I haven&#146;t &#133;&#148; said Kiyone, stopping behind the blonde.

&#147;Yes you have, its clear&#133; you hate me&#133;&#148;said Mihoshi, now bursting with 
tears.

&#147;No!... I don&#146;t Mihoshi, your wrong, I like you Mihoshi &#133;&#148; said 
Kiyone, while turning the blonde around to face her.

&#147;Really?&#148; said the blonde now looking towards the women in front of 
her.

&#147;Yes really&#133;&#148; said Kiyone, looking towards the blondes blue eyes.

Mihoshi was staring into her eyes deep, she wanted to say those three 
words, those three simple words.

&#147;I LOVE YOU KIYONE!&#148; said the blonde quickly turning away, as if 
fearing her own death. Closing hers shut.

&lt;WOAW! Never expect that! &#133; Now what? &#133;Do I feel the way about her? 
&#133;Yes&#133;I do&#133;its finally happening, we soon to be together my love.&gt;

&#147;Mihoshi &#133; look at me&#133;&#148; said the teal-haired women.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry &#133; I&#146;ll be quiet&#133;&#148;said the frightened blonde.

&#147;No Mihoshi, &#133; I&#146;m glad you said that because, &#133;I&#133;I&#133;I love you too 
Mihoshi.&#148;

Said Kiyone, while cupping the blondes face with her hands. Both 
moving closer, both closing their eyes, both meeting their lips. They 
stayed in that passionate kiss, dancing with each other&#146;s tongues, 
tasting each other&#146;s mouth.

&lt;She taste so nice! &#133; What now? &#133;What I spouse to do? &#133; Do I make love 
to her now?&gt;  Thought Mihoshi, while still kissing Kiyone.

&lt; My god! &#133; I&#146;m kissing her! &#133; Shit! Never thought I would love 
Mihoshi &#133; Damn! It was obi verse!  Why couldn&#146;t I tell her a long time 
ago, I thought it was just a fling, I thought all girls get that with 
other girls. Any ways I should forget the past, as long as I&#146;m with 
Mihoshi, I&#146;m happy &#133;but what comes now?...&gt;

Slowly Mihoshi reached to the buttons of Kiyone&#146;s uniform, undoing the 
first button she was stopped by Kiyones hand. Kiyone, breaking the 
passionate kiss, spoke up to the blonde Detective who was now her 
lover.

&#147;No Mihoshi, not yet, we still have to finish patrolling.&#148; Said Kiyone 
with a smile, looking deep in to her lover&#146;s eyes.

&#147;Ok Kiyone but, when do we get to, um&#133; you know, it&#148; said Mihoshi with 
a blush with those innocent child like eyes.

&#147;Soon I promise, but we have to work first, k?&#148; said Kiyone now 
letting go Mihoshi, going back to her work to finish it off.

&#147;Ok Kiyone! I&#146;m glad we got that out! I love you Kiyone.&#148; Said 
Mihoshi, sitting back to her seat, next to her lover, while looking at 
her.

&#147;I love you too Mihoshi.&#148; Said Kiyone with a smile, giving each other 
a small peck on the lips, and resuming back to their work.

AT THE MASKI WOMEN&#146;S ONSEN

At the Onsen, Nagi was they&#146;re taking a nice long bath after the nice 
breakfast she enjoyed. But Nagi was very in deep thought about what 
she will say to Ryoko.

&lt;Ok, hi Ryoko sorry for trying to kill you past these years, but I 
really like you&#133; no! That&#146;s stupid! I&#146;m not going say that! Um&#133;What

you, &#133; mmmm &#133; getting there &#133; &gt;

&#147;Aaaarrrrgggg!!! I never thought this was gonna be that hard!&#148; said a 
rather annoyed Nagi, who splashed the water with her fist. 

&#147;What&#146;s gonna be hard?&#148; said a nude Ryoko, Floating over the water in 
front of Nagi, while putting her hands on her hips.

&#147;Oh nothing, what are you doing her anyways?&#148; said Nagi hiding the 
blush that in fact she is looking her nude, trying to look at her face 
and not her breasts. 

&#147;Same as you are, having a bath.&#148; Said Ryoko, who was looking at 
Nagi&#146;s breasts.

&#147;Oh, well I guess I be leaving then, seeya&#133;&#148; said Nagi, who was about 
to get up.

&#147;No, don&#146;t worry, I don&#146;t mind you&#146;re here, as long as you don&#146;t kill 
me.&#148; Said Ryoko with a smile, and was dipping in to the bathe with 
Nagi and lying down next to her.

&#147;Ok then, so, Ryoko, How have you&#146;ve been past these few years?&#148; said 
Nagi who was starting up a conversation.

&#147;Ok, I guess&#133;&#148; said Ryoko with a frown. 

&#147;You guess? &#133; What do you mean by that? Is there some thing wrong?&#148; 
said Nagi now facing the frowned Ryoko.

&#147;Oh there&#146;s nothing wrong &#133;well look at the time, I better get going.&#148; 
Said Ryoko who was about to get up, but Nagi grabbed her arm gentle. 
Not letting her go.

&#147;No Ryoko, there is something wrong, come on tell me, you might feel 
better by telling me.&#148; Said Nagi, letting go her arm. 

&#147;Oh ok, you win, but you better not tell no-one!&#148; said Ryoko not sure 
to tell her.

&#147;I swear Ryoko, you got my word.&#148; said Nagi. 

Both of them now lying down relaxed, while Nagi is looking at Ryoko, 
and Ryoko looking down at the water.

&#147;Ok how can I put this, um, you know that I really like Tenchi right?&#148; 
said Ryoko

&#147;Yeah&#133;&#148;said Nagi, a bit joules of the boy, because she loved him 
instead of her.

&#147;Well, I um don&#146;t think I love him anymore&#133;&#148;said Ryoko now closing her 
eyes.

&#147;Oh?&#148;Said Nagi, who was a bit happy. &#147;Is that all?&#148; said Nagi, who 
wanted to know more.

&#147;No&#133; in fact there&#146;s two people now I really like&#133;&#148; said Ryoko not 
sure to tell he now.

&#147;Oh? And who may that be Ryoko?&#148;Said Nagi with a bit of hope in the 
question.

&#147;Well theres, Ay&#133;.Ay&#133;. Ayeka.&#148; Said Ryoko, still her eyes closed.

&#147;Oh&#133;Ok and whose the second person Ryoko?&#148; Said Nagi with a bit 
disappointed voice. But with a little hope to see who the second 
person was.

&#147; *Sighs * &#133; you &#133;&#148; whispered Ryoko.

&lt;YES!! ITS ME!!&gt; Thought Nagi with the victory smile. &#147;Ryoko, I didn&#146;t 
know you felt about me like that&#133;in fact I&#146;m glad you do.&#148;

&#147;Huh? Really? Why?&#148; said confused Ryoko, facing towards the hunter.

&#147;Because&#133;to tell you the truth Ryoko&#133;It&#146;s not because of ken-oki I&#146;m 
here&#133;&#148;said Nagi, still with the smile.

&#147;Then why?...&#148;said still a confused Ryoko.

&#147;Well I came her to tell you that, I&#146;m quieting our little chase&#133;&#148;said 
Nagi now facing the water.

&#147;Is that all?&#148; said Ryoko.

&#147;No&#133;in fact&#133;I came here to tell you how I Really feel about you&#133;&#148;said 
Nagi, facing back to Ryoko.

&#147;Really feel about me?&#133; what do you mean about that Nagi?&#148; said Ryoko 
with a little hope what she might think it is.

&#147;I mean&#133;I like you Ryoko&#133;in fact&#133; I think I &#133;I&#133;I&#133;lo&#133;lo&#133;love you.&#148; Said 
Nagi with a bit a blush, facing towards Ryoko.

&#147;Nagi&#133;Nagi! I&#146;m so happy!&#148; said Ryoko, now hugging Nagi.

&#147;Me too Ryoko&#133;me too&#133;&#148;said Nagi hugging back Ryoko, who liked the feel 
of the pirate&#146;s breasts against hers.

&#147;Nagi&#133;&#148;said Ryoko pulling back away from Nagi.

&#147;Yes &#133; my dear?&#148; said Nagi looking in to her lover&#146;s golden eyes.

&#147;I still like Ayeka&#133;&#148;said Ryoko, who turned away a bit.

&#147;I know Ryoko, but I do love you.&#148; Said Nagi.

&#147;Yes I know&#133;how much I want you now, I don&#146;t know who to choose.&#148; Said 
Ryoko.

&#147;Well maybe this will change your mind&#133;&#148; and with that, Nagi pulled 
Ryoko&#146;s face gentle towards her, and gave the biggest passionate kiss 
she ever gave.

Both of them opened their mouths slightly, and with that, Nagi slowly 
put her tongue in her lover&#146;s mouth. Slowly dancing with each other&#146;s 
mouth, they parted away, after a minunte.

&#147;That was incredible!&#148; said Ryoko gasping for air.

&#147;I know my sweet, but I can do more incredible things than just a 
kiss&#133;&#148; said Nagi with a sly smile.

&#147;&#133;Take me&#133;now&#133;&#148;said Ryoko, who wanted her right now.

&#147;Hehehe&#133;as you wish my love&#133;&#148;and with that, Nagi kissed Ryoko on the 
lips.

Slowly parting away, Nagi showered kisses upon Ryoko&#146;s neck, Ryoko 
giving little gasps with every kiss that Nagi gave. Taking this as a 
delight, Nagi gave a little lick on her neck, causing her to shiver 
her a bit. Magi slowly going down until she stopped at Ryoko&#146;s well 
formed breasts. Taking the harden nipple into her mouth, Nagi gentle 
sucked it with pleasure, meanwhile her other hand slowly went to the 
left breast and started to massage it gentle, and rubbing at the top 
with her thumb causing another gasp and moan form Ryoko. Ryoko, who 
couldn&#146;t take any more of the tease, she gentle put her hand inside of 
Nagi&#146;s hair until she reached her skull and gentle moved her down to 
her cunt who was screaming for Nagi&#146;s pleasure.

&#147;I want you&#133;. inside&#133;of me&#133;Nagi&#133;&#148;said Ryoko between gasps.

&#147;Un patient aren&#146;t we?&#133;*smirks* I was gone to go there anyways now&#133;&#148; 
and with that, Nagi slowly went to Ryoko&#146;s now wet cunt.

Nagi slowly took her hands away form Ryoko&#146;s breasts, and slid them 
down Ryoko&#146;s stomach, along with her head and she stopped at the wet 
cunt, while her hand stopped at Ryoko&#146;s hips for support. Licking her 
lips, and with a smirk, Nagi slowly approached the cunt, parted her 
pussy lips with her tong she approached her pussy hole. Entering it 
with her tongue she heard a soft gasp form Ryoko. Knowing she is 
enjoying it, she completely stretched her tong as far as she could, 
when she did, she went in and out of Ryoko, first slowly, the faster 
and faster, picking up pace. Hearing the gasps and moan form Ryoko, 
Nagi pushed her self even further and went even faster. After about 
two minutes straight, Nagi felt Ryoko&#146;s muscles tightened, and with a 
loud scream, Ryoko finally climaxed. The liquid came out like a small 
river on to Nagi&#146;s tong. Nagi gratefully liked how Ryoko tasted, Nagi 
hungrily eat it.

While doing this, the screamed that Ryoko made, some one had heard it.

------------------------------------------------------------------

AYEKA AND SASAMI&#146;S ROOM

Ayeka was at her futon, reading a book but heard the scream, which 
Ryoko had made.

&#147; *GASP * what was that?... It sounded like Ryoko! &#133; Oh no! Maybe she 
in trouble? &#133;Nagi! &#133;&#148; And with that, Ayeka chucked the book away and 
ran to the hallway, stopped in the middle of it. She turned her head 
to side-to-side, seeing if she can look for any sign of Ryoko. No she 
didn&#146;t, but she heard moans of her&#133;

&#147;Ryoko?...&#148; Ayeka was curies, and with that she fallowed the moans, 
until she reached the women&#146;s bath. The door was slightly open, and 
with that, Ayeka took a little peek throw it. She was shocked!. She 
couldn&#146;t believe it with her eyes. She saw Ryoko and Nagi making love. 
She was furriess and heart broken at the same time. She wanted to go 
in there and kill Nagi, but she can&#146;t, she knew whom Ryoko really 
loved, and she knew it wasn&#146;t gone to be her, so she stand up straight 
and walked of, soon she was far away, ran of crying. She went to her 
room; she opened the door and shut it behind her. She went on top of 
her futon, crying out loud in to her pillow, she never felt like this 
before, she felt like she just been turned apart, her heart all walked 
over. After about 10 minutes of crying her heart out, looked around, 
she saw a desk, she couldn&#146;t take this any more, and she only knew one 
thing to do. She stood up, walked of the desk, took a seat, a pen and 
paper, and began writing what she felt.

Dear Ryoko-
	I have enjoyed being your friend, even it didn&#146;t seemed like it, 
but to me, you were the greatest friend I could ever ask for. Too bad 
we couldn&#146;t be more than friends. I remember the first time we met. It 
was at my royal garden. When you were making a flower chain. I saw 
you, so I went up to. You looked at me with those golden eyes of 
yours. You asked me if I want to join you, of course I did, I didn&#146;t 
had many friends back then. I think it was then I felled in love with, 
of course I couldn&#146;t tell. I was too scared to tell you. You came 
every day in the garden to visit me, we played, and have tea parties, 
and we mostly down every thing together. We where the bests of friends 
then. But about after a few years later, you stopped visiting me. I 
thought I done something wrong. I thought you didn&#146;t like me anymore. 
But when came back, you was under Kagato&#146;s control. I was shocked and 
heartbroken. You attacked Juri. But I knew it wasn&#146;t your fault. But 
when we met again, I was so happy; my heart just skipped a beat. But I 
saw you all over lord Tenchi, I was heart broken again. So since then 
I was jealous that you loved him, not me. Every body thought that I 
loved him also. So I played along with it, while bearing my feelings 
for you. But once I couldn&#146;t go along with this lie I had to tell you. 
But I was afraid again. A faired that you will reject me. A faired you 
will laugh at me, and I would not be able to face you again. But today 
Ryoko, all of the hurtful things in the past that happened came 
flooding back all at once. My heart was crushed Ryoko. You chose Nagi. 
I saw you two making love. And I&#146;m even more sorry of me for not 
telling you that I loved you sooner. As for now dear Ryoko, you won&#146;t 
see me anymore nor anyone else. Please tell everyone that I love them 
very much and miss them dearly. Please tell my father and mother and 
aunt Fahano that I will miss them very much. And please take care of 
Sasami; she always looked up to you. Your probley think you don&#146;t know 
what I am talking about. I&#146;m talking about that I will no longer live, 
for that I cannot handle no more pain in my heart Ryoko. Heh&#133;you was 
right Ryoko, my destiny was towards the grave&#133;good bye my sweet Ryoko&#133;

P.S
I hope that you will live happily with Nagi, I&#146;m sorry it wasn&#146;t me to 
live with you.

I all ways love you,
---Ayeka

With that, Ayeka fold up the letter that she wrote and wrote Ryoko on 
the front. She got up and went out of her room, and went quietly down 
the hall and went to Ryoko&#146;s room. She opens the door, walked in, and 
closed it behind her.  Ayeka went up to Ryoko&#146;s bed and placed the 
letter on the pillow, and then she took of her Juri headband and 
placed it next to the letter. She saw the window in front of the bed; 
she opened it, and went out side and closed it gently.

She carefully jumped of the roof, and ran off to the woods. Running 
along on the path, shedding tears on to the stone path, giving a trail 
on the path of tears, she ran for five minuets, until she stopped, 
reaching to the cliffs. She was gasping for air, but still shedding 
the tears. She reached the end of the cliff, and then stopped at the 
end. Her hands together closed, is resting on her heart. The tears 
rolling down her cheeks and dropped on top of her hands.

&lt;Good-bye my love&gt; she looked back at the Maski House one more time. 
She looked in front of her. The sun was setting in to the mountains, 
the sky was mol tie colured by the rays. The calm lake was sparkling. 
She parted her hands, and stretched them in mid air. &lt;I will all ways 
love you my sweet, I truly hope that you will live happily with your 
true love&#133;&gt; with one glance at a image of Ryoko and her happily making 
flower chains in the royal garden in her head, and one last tear she 
will shed. She took one step forward, &lt;good bye Ryoko&gt; and fell&#133;

------------------------------------------------------------------
