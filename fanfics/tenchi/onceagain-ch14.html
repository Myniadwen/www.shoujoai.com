<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 14 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/onceagain-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Naru Narusegawa smiled as she finished her class, the
brown haired woman watching happily as the children
filed out. She tidied up her desk and headed out of
the small school on the island, hurrying over to her
friend who was waiting nearby.

&quot;How&#39;s teaching the kids going?&quot; Haruka Urashima
asked, the darker brown haired older woman having her
usual unlit cigarette dangling from her mouth.

&quot;They&#39;re young enough not to talk back,&quot; Naru
chuckled softly.

Since coming to the island with her husband Keitaro
and their friend Seta Naru had put her teaching skills
to good use. Joining a improvised school for the
children of the archeologists Naru assisted where she
could, in the process gaining credit she could use
towards her advanced degree work.

&quot;Hey, Naru!&quot; Sarah McDougal yelled, the little blonde
laughing as the young girl broke away from one of the
other class groups to race over to their side. &quot;When
are you coming to teach us?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;When your teacher gets too scared to come back?&quot;
Naru teased her impishly.

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Sarah scoffed before pelting off in
another direction.

&quot;That girl&#39;s got way too much energy,&quot; Haruka laughed
softly as they left the improvised school buildings
and headed for the nearby archeological site.

&quot;Got that right,&quot; Naru chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m almost dreading
having to teach her.&quot;

Haruka raised her eyebrows, &quot;I thought you two got
along?&quot;

&quot;We do, but....,&quot; Naru shrugged and Haruka grinned in
understanding. Sarah was going to be a handful, no
doubt about that.

This pacific island was the latest site where traces
had been found of the long lost Turtle civilization
that Seta had devoted himself to finding. While the
discovery of the civilization&#39;s capital Todai had
helped the research immensely, Seta and his crew of
misfits were determined to prove that the Turtle
civilization had been wide spread and vital in the
region.

&quot;Ho!&quot; Seta called from one of the pits the group was
carefully digging, cautiously removing layers of dirt
to reveal the secrets beneath them. The gangly but
athletic Seta bounded up the ladder and swept up the
startled Haruka in a hug as he said, &quot;Good news!&quot;

Wham! Without even thinking about it Haruka hammered
Seta with her fist, barely fazing the man but making
him let her go. &quot;What have you found now?&quot; she asked,
grinning.

&quot;Keitaro fell into a abandoned well,&quot; Seta grinned at
them, &quot;and tracing it we found a series of water
carrying canals, too. Looks like we might have found
the key to mapping out the whole settlement.&quot;

&quot;Good for you,&quot; Naru chuckled, glad to see Keitaro&#39;s
uncanny gift for archeology was continuing to do it&#39;s
work. No matter where he was Keitaro could seemingly
fall into a hole, trip over something or some other
accident and somehow end up finding a valuable
artifact or discovery. It was positively uncanny, and
Seta had learned to use him like a dowsing rod to find
what he was looking for.

&quot;He all right?&quot; Haruka asked mildly. One of Keitaro&#39;s
other gifts was a near miraculous ability to survive
injury, but it never hurt to check.

&quot;He&#39;s fine,&quot; Seta waved that off casually as he
continued, &quot;in fact, I left him digging near the
central fountain.&quot;

Just then, they felt a low rumble deep in the earth,
and everyone paused to look at one another. &quot;Where&#39;s
the fountain?&quot; Naru yelped as Seta bolted off, both
women quickly following after him.

The village they had excevated was roughly circular,
but so far only the town center had been fully
uncovered. The homes were stone walls, the thatched
roofs long having surrendered to decay, and in the
center of the city was a large fountain, presumedly
fed by channels from the well and canal system they
had already discovered.

Apparently, they were wrong about that.

Keitaro smiled sheepishly as water geisered up from
the fountain, raining down on the workers around them,
many of whom were dancing under the water after
dealing with so many got summer days. &quot;Sorry, Seta,&quot;
Keitaro said sheepishly, the brown haired man still
holding his shovel, &quot;I was clearing some rubble
when....&quot;

&quot;Well, that solves our water problems,&quot; Haruka noted
wryly, tilting her head back to let the cool water
splash her face.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Meanwhile, in another part of the world the group of
weary warriors returned home, a bit battered but
otherwise unharmed. &quot;All right, everyone out,&quot; Kitsune
said briskly, the sandy blonde haired woman sliding
the door to the battered van open.

&quot;If we&#39;re going to do this more often,&quot; Rei Hino
noted as the black haired miko climbed out stiffly,
&quot;we need more seats.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try to budget for that,&quot; Kitsune promised. She
looked up at her guest, &quot;Nice support work, miss
Tenjou.&quot;

Utena Tenjou smiled back coolly, the pink haired
woman climbing out then offering her hand to help
Anthy down. &quot;Glad to help,&quot; she answered honestly,
smiling as Anthy stood close to her side.

Ema Maeda sighed softly, &#39;Those two are SO cute.&#39;
Shaking herself the brown haired girl patted her
laptop lovingly as she said, &quot;I think I got a lot of
good footage today for the website.&quot;

&quot;I still find it hard to believe that people watch
such things,&quot; Makoto frowned slightly, her long black
hair still tied back like when she went into battle,
her katana resting at her side.

&quot;You&#39;re very popular,&quot; Ema blushed faintly as she
elaborated, &quot;in fact, the polls rate you as top member
of the Phantom Quest Corp.&quot;

&quot;Ehh?&quot; Makoto blushed brightly.

&quot;I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; Kitsune murmured as the group
tiredly trooped inside the Hinata girl&#39;s dorm and inn.
Taking their shoes off at the door they broke up to
head to their rooms, as well as heading out to the
baths for a after work dip.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Ami Mizuno smiled as Rei entered
their room, the smaller blue haired woman squeezing
her in a hug.

&quot;Have a good study session?&quot; Rei asked as she hugged
her back then quickly began to change out of her white
and red miko&#39;s garb.

&quot;We&#39;ve moved from gastric to colon,&quot; Ami said dryly.

&quot;Enough said,&quot; Rei agreed as she slipped into a
towel. She smiled charmingly, &quot;Want to join in at the
hot spring?&quot;

&quot;Depends,&quot; Ami winked, &quot;what are we doing after?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be here in our bedroom all alone,&quot; Rei grinned
back, &quot;guess.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll certainly join you,&quot; Ami laughed,
stripping out of her usual blue skirt and white top
and grabbing a towel too.

When they emerged they saw Anthy talking to Kitsune,
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but Utena and I will wash up later.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kitsune looked curious.

Anthy hesitated a moment, &quot;She has... scars. Utena&#39;s
not exactly comfortable showing them to people yet.&quot;

Kitsune&#39;s eyes widened a bit, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Do you want
us to clear out in a hour or so, that way you can
bathe in peace?&quot;

Anthy smiled, &quot;We&#39;d appreciate that.&quot;

&#39;Should I mention it to the others?&#39; Kitsune thought
as she, Ami and Rei went out into the hot springs.
&#39;No,&#39; she decided, &#39;they deserve their privacy.&#39;

&quot;Where&#39;s Utena and Anthy?&quot; Ema asked curiously.

&quot;They&#39;ll be down later,&quot; Rei said mildly.
