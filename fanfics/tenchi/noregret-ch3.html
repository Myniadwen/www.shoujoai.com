<h1>No Need for Regrets (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a>

<a href="../tenchi/noregret-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Minagi stood nervously before the Emperor, even as Washu and Mihoshi 
gave her reassuring smiles. Tenchi gazed at her levelly, giving her 
request serious consideration. He suddenly smiled, and Minagi knew it 
was going to be all right.

&quot;I&#39;d be honored to have you join my diplomatic service,&quot; Tenchi said, 
smiling at her gently. &quot;In fact, there is an urgent assignment that 
you and your ship, the Hinase, could be a great help with,&quot; he 
finished.

&quot;What would that be?&#39; Minagi asked him, relaxing a little.

&quot;There&#39;s a urgent diplomatic conference on Earth that we need to send 
a very high level representative to. Hinase is one of the fastest 
ships I know, so would you be willing to transport our envoy?&quot; Tenchi 
asked.

&quot;Sure, I&#39;d be glad to help,&quot; Minagi said with a enthusiastic nod. This 
trip would get her out of the palace for a little while, and maybe 
give her some peaceful time to consider the odd feelings she was 
having about Sasami.

&quot;Good,&quot; Washu chimed in with a smile. &quot;You&#39;ll need to leave as soon as 
possible to make it there on time, so could you depart tomorrow?&quot; 
Minagi nodded at that, and Washu smiled widely. &quot;Then we&#39;ll make sure 
you and Sasami are ready to go.&quot;

&quot;Sa.. Sasami?&quot; Minagi repeated.

&quot;Yes, she&#39;s the envoy we&#39;re sending,&quot; a broadly smiling Mihoshi said 
to Minagi in her cheerful, bubbly way.

Minagi looked at the smiling Tenchi, Washu and Mihoshi, and 
sweatdropped, knowing, somehow, that she had just been set up.



Sasami frowned as she paced her quarters later that evening. &quot;She 
didn&#39;t seem very happy when she found out I was the envoy,&quot; she 
fretted. She moved from the bed to the dressers. then back again, 
filled with restless energy.

Funaho and Misaki were sitting on the couch together, holding hands. 
&quot;I&#39;m sure she was just surprised,&quot; Funaho told her gently.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Sasami said doubtfully. &quot;I&#39;m suddenly wondering if it was 
such a good idea to trade assignments with Ayeka,&quot; she worried. She 
stopped to check her luggage, pulling a few things out, then putting 
them back in.

&quot;But this way you can spend some time alone, together!&quot; Misaki said 
cheerfully. &quot;Just think of all the fun you could have,&quot; she added, 
eyes sparkling happily. She looked over at Funaho and a faint blush 
colored her cheeks.

Funaho met her gaze and gave a small, sexy smile. She shook herself, 
and focused back on Sasami. &quot;This will give her a chance to get to 
know the grown up Sasami, not the little girl she remembers,&quot; Funaho 
reassured her. &quot;You might even find the opportunity to tell her about 
your feelings for her, if things so well,&quot; she added.

Sasami took a deep, steadying breath, and &quot;Your right, Mother I just 
have to focus on the positive and give it my all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll succeed!&quot; Misaki said happily, clutching poor Sasami 
in one of her death grip hugs! The girl&#39;s arms flailed as she tried to 
get free, and Funaho chuckled as she watched.



Minagi stood on the bridge of her starship, Hinase, and gazed out the 
screens at the stars shining against the depths of space. She and 
Sasami had been traveling together for the last week, to attend the 
latest of a series of diplomatic conferences on Earth. The trip would 
take them at least a week longer, and she was glad to have the 
company.

Sasami took a deep, steadying breath at the closed door to the bridge. 
&#39;Today&#39;s the day,&#39; she thought to herself. &#39;Today I tell her how I 
feel,&#39; she repeated it firmly, like a mantra, as she gave the command 
for the door to open.

&quot;Hello, Lady Sasami!&quot; the ship&#39;s main computer said to Sasami 
cheerfully as she stepped out of the hallway and on to the bridge as 
well. Minagi turned to smile a moment at her, even as troubling 
thoughts continued to run through her mind.

What had happened at the welcome back party Washu had held for her 
still bothered Minagi a bit. She and Sasami... she blushed as she 
remembered how good it had felt to dance with her. She frowned, and 
what was with the veiled comments by Funaho and the others?

&quot;Deep in thought?&quot; Sasami asked her, seemingly having just appeared 
out of nowhere to stand by Minagi&#39;s side. She smiled up at the still 
faintly blushing Minagi, and her violet eyes twinkled at her merrily.

&quot;I was daydreaming, really,&quot; Minagi confessed to Sasami with a little 
grin. Sasami linked her arm into Minagi&#39;s, and she tugged on it 
gently.

&quot;I&#39;m certain Hinase can handle things here,&quot; Sasami said, a broad 
smile on her pretty face, &quot;so why don&#39;t you come and have breakfast 
with me?&quot; She looked up at Minagi entreatingly, taking a half step 
towards her.

Minagi blushed a bit darker as Sasami accidentally pressed up to her 
side, sparking strange feelings in her body. &quot;Uh, OK, sure,&quot; she 
stuttered out. Sasami&#39;s face seemed to almost light up with happiness 
as she literally dragged Minagi off the flight deck. &quot;Please keep an 
eye on things,&quot; Minagi barely managed to shout over her shoulder to 
the main computer&#39;s central unit.

Hinase&#39;s central unit bobbed there in mid air, and watched them leave 
with a great deal of restrained amusement. It actually sounded quite 
amused too, as it answered her cheerfully, &quot;I hope you two have fun, 
now!&quot;

Sasami quickly led Minagi down the hall to the lift, then down a few 
levels of the ship, to the fully equipped galley. Sasami sat Minagi 
down at the dining table and then she opened the door to go into the 
kitchen.

As soon as the galley doors opened Minagi caught the wondrous scent of 
the food cooking inside, and her complaining stomach suddenly growled 
its hunger loudly. Sasami turned back to her in surprise, and Minagi 
blushed brightly. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; Minagi bowed as she apologized 
to the smiling Sasami.

Sasami laughed at her cheerfully, &quot;I guess I better get you fed soon.&quot; 
She headed back to the kitchen, and Minagi heard the familiar sounds 
of the young lady&#39;s cooking. A few moments later, they both began to 
chow down.

Sasami&#39;s cooking, Minagi noted to herself as she ate happily, had 
actually gotten even better than it had been before! &quot;This is great,&quot; 
Minagi said to her cheerfully. Sasami put her fork down and beamed 
back at her.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sasami said cheerfully. &quot;I don&#39;t get to cook like this as 
often as I like,&quot; she added, &quot;so I&#39;m enjoying this, too.&quot;

They ate a little while longer, then a question Minagi had been 
meaning to ask her came to mind. &quot;Sasami, I was wondering why aren&#39;t 
you taking Tsunami to the conference? I&#39;m sure you could get there 
nearly as fast as Hinase,&quot; she added the last with a grin.

&quot;Do you really want to try and race me?&quot; Sasami asked her jokingly. 
Minagi looked like she was actually considering the idea, and Sasami 
chuckled. She got a bit more serious as she softly added, &quot;Tsunami&#39;s 
primary role is as the guardian vessel of Jurai. Its place should 
really be there,&quot; she smiled a bit then, shrugging as she added 
&quot;baring any unforeseen events, of course.&quot;

&quot;I do recall several instances where Tsunami came riding to all our 
rescues,&quot; Minagi said with a considering nod. &quot;Of course, it was 
usually to help save the Jurai royal family, the planet, or the entire 
sector itself,&quot; she finished thoughtfully.

&quot;Or me,&quot; Sasami acknowledged. &quot;I think I called it once or twice, like 
when Tenchi first battled Kagato.&quot; She blushed a bit, remembering how 
Tsunami had then tried to act out the girlish crush Sasami had once 
carried for poor Tenchi. Sasami was certainly glad she had finally 
managed to grow out of that phase!

&quot;Or when the Great Trees went out of control,&quot; Minagi quietly noted. 
That had been a spectacularly big mess, and if Tsunami hadn&#39;t 
intervened then, they, along side most of the Jurai fleet, would 
probably not be here right now.

&quot;I wish I had been awake, that time,&quot; Sasami sighed a bit sadly. It 
was quite irritating to keep having people talk about it, when she had 
been forcefully removed from the fight. Washu, to try and protect her, 
had medicated her into unconsciousness. She did have some odd dreams 
about what happened though, and all of them were from Tsunami&#39;s 
perspective.

Minagi paused for a second, as if she was searching for just the right 
words. She looked across the table and asked Sasami tentatively, &quot;If 
it&#39;s not out of line, I was wondering what&#39;s it like, now that you&#39;ve 
merged with Tsunami?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that different from before, really,&quot; Sasami admitted. She 
smiled a bit, &quot;Tsunami and I are just two aspects of the same being, 
two parts of the same whole. She is a part of me and I&#39;m also a part 
of her, both of us linked together across any distance.&quot;

&quot;Does that mean she can hear your thoughts? Does she watch everything 
you do?&quot; Minagi asked her with a little frown.

Sasami laughed softly at that. &quot;You make Tsunami sound like some 
glorified peeping tom,&quot; she said, chuckling softly. &quot;She and I are one 
being in two bodies,&quot; Sasami patiently explained, &quot;there&#39;s no real 
distinction between us.&quot;

&quot;I guess that does make sense,&quot; Minagi said, nodding thoughtfully. 
While they were talking, they had both nearly cleared off their 
plates. Minagi scooped up a forkful of her food and pointed it at 
Sasami, &quot;Have I told you yet that you are one incredible cook?&quot;

Sasami blushed, &quot;You&#39;ve told me before, but you&#39;re welcome to repeat 
it as many times as you like.&quot; She laughed, and rose to pick up the 
various plates and bowls.

Minagi leapt to her feet to help her, and they brought the piles of 
dishes into the kitchen to place them in the gleaming chrome sink. 
Sasami filled it up with hot water, a little bit of soap, and then she 
began to wash.

&quot;Isn&#39;t there a automatic dishwasher here?&quot; Minagi asked the busy young 
woman, sounding a little bit surprised.

&quot;I like doing it this way,&quot; Sasami said, shrugging with a small smile. 
&quot;It reminds me of when we were all together back in Tenchi&#39;s home on 
Earth.&quot;

&quot;Then let me help,&quot; Minagi said, stepping up to stand beside her at 
the sink. &quot;You wash, and I&#39;ll rinse and dry,&quot; a smiling Minagi 
suggested. Sasami made a soft sound to indicate her agreement, and 
they began to wash.

&quot;Do you miss being on Earth, then?&quot; Minagi asked Sasami softly, as she 
reached over to take a plate from Sasami&#39;s hand. Their fingers softly 
brushed, Sasami trembled a little and both of them blushed a bit.

The slightly shorter woman shrugged a bit uncomfortably in reply. &quot;It 
was certainly simpler,&quot; Sasami admitted, &quot;our lives were all a lot 
less complicated.&quot; She smiled up at Minagi as she added, &quot;And that was 
when I first met you.&quot;

Minagi warmly smiled back at her, &quot;That was a red letter day to me, 
too.&quot; Minagi frowned thoughtfully, &quot;Did caring for me take you all 
away from Earth too soon?&quot;

Sasami blushed, &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so.&quot; She shook her head, &quot;All your 
injury did was force us all, in our own ways, to begin to grow up.&quot; 
She grinned, &quot;I don&#39;t think Washu and Mihoshi would have had a chance 
with Tenchi without you.&quot;

Minagi looked at her in surprise, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Both of them showed their more mature sides to him,&quot; Sasami 
explained, &quot;Washu in the med-lab and Mihoshi in dealing with the 
bureaucracy. Though I think Mihoshi&#39;s job might have been harder,&quot; she 
admitted.

Minagi nodded thoughtfully, and they both silently resumed washing, 
Sasami scrubbing the dishes then passing them to Minagi to carefully 
rinse off and dry. Minagi had to remind herself to hold her strength 
in check, it was so easy for her to accidentally break the plates.

Minagi searched under the suds for a plate that had slipped out of her 
fingers, and she felt something odd. Her hand reached for it, and then 
felt Sasami&#39;s delicate fingers against her own. Her fingers tangled in 
Sasami&#39;s, who looked up at Minagi, blushing faintly. They froze there, 
looking into each other&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Minagi..&quot; Sasami said faintly, eyes locked with hers, &quot;I.. I&#39;ve 
wanted to tell you...&quot; She hesitated, fear seizing her, then the 
glitter of tears began to appear at the corners of Sasami&#39;s eyes. She 
pulled herself free from Minagi&#39;s touch and turned to suddenly run 
right out of the galley with soapsuds still clinging to both her 
hands.

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Minagi frantically tried to call out to her, but it 
was too late. &quot;Damn,&quot; she cursed softly. &#39;What did I do,&#39; a dismayed 
Minagi wondered, &#39;what did I say?&#39; She just abandoned the dishes and 
then rushed out of the galley after her.



Sasami sat on her bed, and weakly wiped at her red-rimmed eyes. &#39;Why 
didn&#39;t I just tell her?&#39; she thought to herself sadly. &#39;Now she 
probably thinks I&#39;m strange or something, to suddenly run away from 
her like that!&#39; She looked over to her bedside, at all the photos she 
had taken over the years that sat there.

There was one of Ayeka, Yosho, Sasami&#39;s two mothers, a fairly 
irritable shot of Ryouko, and a group photo of all their friends 
gathered out in front of Tenchi&#39;s home, on Earth. There were pictures 
of places they&#39;d been, and the many friends they had made along the 
way.

And one other image, one Sasami considered to be her most precious: 
she had caught her by surprise in the photo, her body turning just in 
time to catch the light of the flash. Minagi had looked out at her so 
sweetly, her face showing her honest surprise. Sasami reached over to 
pick up the photo, then gently cradled it in her arms.

There was a soft knock on the door, and Sasami started in surprise. 
&#39;Of course, she followed me,&#39; she thought to herself wearily. She 
hesitated, wracked with indecision, then after a moment loudly said, 
&quot;Come in.&quot;

The door slid aside and Minagi slowly walked into Sasami&#39;s stateroom. 
She stood there a moment, then walked over to where Sasami sat on top 
of the bedcovers. She hesitated there, before she sat down on the 
edge. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Minagi said to Sasami, gazing away from her, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what I did to upset you, but...&quot;

Sasami looked at Minagi in surprise. &#39;She blamed herself, for what 
happened,&#39; she thought, astonished. Her jaw tensed, &#39;I can&#39;t let this 
go on any longer.&#39; She placed her hand on Minagi&#39;s arm, shaking her 
head firmly.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; Sasami said to her firmly to Minagi, &quot;I just 
wanted to tell you about something, something very important to me, 
but I panicked and ran away.&quot; Minagi looked over at her questioningly, 
and she smiled at her weakly. &quot;Minagi,&quot; Sasami started softly, then 
she forced herself to continue on, &quot;I&#39;m in love with you!&quot;

Minagi looked at her in surprise, and Sasami felt her heart sink in 
her chest. &#39;She&#39;s shocked,&#39; Sasami thought to herself shakily, &#39;oh god 
what have I done?&#39; She tried to get up, run right out of the room, but 
Minagi gently caught her arm.

&quot;You love me?&quot; Minagi repeated Sasami&#39;s words, a bit of awe and 
surprise in her voice. She shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t understand, how 
could someone as wonderful as you love someone like me. All I am is 
just a poor copy of Ryouko, not even as tough as she is, how could 
you...&quot;

&#39;She called me wonderful,&#39; Sasami thought to herself dazedly. &quot;I don&#39;t 
want someone like Ryouko is, I love you, Minagi,&quot; Sasami said softly. 
&quot;The kind, caring woman whom I fell in love with, and I wasn&#39;t even 
aware of it until I nearly lost you to Kagato&#39;s weapon,&quot; she finished 
shyly, unable to meet the possible rejection she might see in Minagi&#39;s 
eyes.

Minagi&#39;s fingers slid under her chin to softly push Sasami&#39;s face up, 
her eyes unwillingly meeting Minagi&#39;s warmly smiling gaze. She tugged 
on her arm, gently, and Sasami sat by her on the bed as Minagi said to 
her, &quot;I love you, too.&quot;

Sasami looked at her a moment, not sure she had heard her right. Then, 
a smile widening on her face, she wrapped her arms around Minagi, 
holding her tight. She suddenly broke into tears, to Minagi&#39;s great 
surprise.

She awkwardly began to pat the back of the sobbing Sasami, while 
asking her questions like &quot;Are you all right? Did I say something 
wrong?&quot; and other frantically delivered requests.

Sasami managed a laugh. &quot;I&#39;m only crying because I&#39;m so happy,&quot; she 
explained, beaming at Minagi. She leaned forward tentatively, and 
Minagi eagerly leaned forward to meet her in a fiercely passionate 
kiss!

Minagi felt a gentle pressure on her shoulders, and willingly let 
herself be pressed backward onto the bed. Sasami reclined on top of 
her, smiling down at her wickedly. &quot;You have no idea how long I&#39;ve 
wanted to do this,&quot; Sasami said to her softly.

&quot;I think I can guess,&quot; Minagi answered, a bit breathlessly. Sasami 
began to release the clasps on Minagi&#39;s bodysuit, then quickly pulled 
her own robes off with a few simple gestures. Minagi gulped at the 
sight before her.

The Hinase&#39;s central unit perked up as it suddenly received a message 
from Minagi&#39;s personal communicator. &quot;Hinase, I&#39;m leaving you in 
charge,&quot; Minagi said to it, then, more quietly to someone else, &quot;oh, 
that feels nice,&quot; then louder again to Hinase, &quot;Don&#39;t call me unless 
the ship&#39;s actually under attack or key sections of you are on fire, 
understood?&quot; In the background, Hinase could hear rustling noises, and 
a familiar giggle.

&quot;What is going on there?&quot; Hinase asked her curiously.

&quot;Oh, oh that&#39;s good,&quot; softly, then more loud again to Hinase, &quot;It&#39;s 
none of your business! Minagi, signing out!&quot;

Hinase hovered in mid air there a moment, considering the situation, 
then it gradually changed color, going from it&#39;s normal clarity to 
become more and more pinkish tinted as it realized what, exactly, was 
likely happening down there.



Minagi and Sasami stood closely together, looking out the large 
viewing port at the planet Earth turning slowly below them. They each 
just wore long, simply designed lounging robes, and not their normal 
garb.

Hinase hovered nearby, &quot;It&#39;s very nice to see you both up and around 
again. After not seeing both of you for a week, I was getting a bit 
worried.&quot;

Minagi chuckled softly. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be seeing us now if we hadn&#39;t 
finally reached our destination,&quot; she said to Hinase with a grin.

&quot;I wish this trip hadn&#39;t come to an end so soon,&quot; a faintly blushing 
Sasami sighed, leaning in to relax in the curve of Minagi&#39;s arm.

&quot;It&#39;s not,&quot; Minagi pointed out. She grinned down at Sasami, &quot;There&#39;s 
still the long trip back home, too. I&#39;m sure I can manage to keep 
you... entertained, my love.&quot;

Sasami blushed scarlet. She smiled up at Minagi, &quot;And there&#39;s always 
those unexpected delays, too. Why, the trip home might take weeks 
longer than normal.&quot;

They both shared a soft laugh at that. </pre>
