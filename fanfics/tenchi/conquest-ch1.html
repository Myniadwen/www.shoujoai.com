<h1>Conquest (part 1 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Princess Ayeka of Jurai stood ready in the courtyard of the palace, 
dressed in her very best finery, long robes that swept to the ground, 
light blues and white. She took a moment to look around her, to see 
what had become of her homeland. The fires in the nearby buildings 
were finally out, and the repairs only just begun. She closed her 
violet eyes, then opened them again to gaze up at the sky. She was 
here, in this place of ash and former glory, to greet Jurai&#39;s new 
queen.

Ayeka couldn&#39;t believe things could have changed so much so fast. Only 
a few years ago, their enemy had emerged on a little known planet 
called Manticore, taking over the other bandit tribes of that savage 
world, uniting them under one rule. Then with the aide of a incredible 
new technology, they had left their home world, and the conquest had 
begun.

Their nearby worlds rallied under the new queen&#39;s banner, and they 
expanded outward to rule over dozens of worlds, calling themselves the 
Republic of Manticore. Strangely, the worlds they took over seemed to 
be quite content to remain under her rule, and even members of the 
greatest galactic powers began to fear her.

Finally, when Manticore&#39;s expansion reached their own borders and 
finally came to a stop, Jurai believed their foe was at last 
overextended. The Emperor himself gave the order for his fleet to 
attack them, not knowing it would become his final mistake.

The takeover of the planet had only taken a few short days, the enemy 
fleet was relentless in the pursuit of their final victory. One by 
one, Jurai&#39;s traditional allies had been forced to reluctantly 
withdrawal from the battlefield, finally leaving them all alone 
against the enemy&#39;s forces. And Jurai&#39;s armies just weren&#39;t enough.

They had been informed of their conquer&#39;s demand that she be waiting 
out there when their leader arrived only a few hours before she was 
due to land. Ayeka had spent the little time she had left preparing, 
dressing as if for a formal reception, with all the proper rituals 
being carefully observed. At Sasami&#39;s gaze she had softly answered her 
unspoken question, &quot;We may be the conquered, but we still have our 
pride.&quot;

The transport sphere came down, settling in on the ground right in 
front of them. Ayeka carefully straightened her robes, nervously 
brushing her long black hair back. The scarlet energy dissipated 
gradually, slowly revealing the figure it had carried, the Queen of 
Manticore and all of it&#39;s subject worlds herself. Surprisingly, a 
small smile tugged at those lips, the head tilted towards her in an 
almost... fond gesture.

&quot;Hello, Ayeka,&quot; Ryouko said to her with a wry smile, &quot;it&#39;s been a long 
time.&quot;



Ayeka paced the luxurious suite she and Sasami soon found themselves 
sharing, a deeply confused expression on her face. &#39;I almost expected 
to be dead by now,&#39; Ayeka darkly thought, &#39;or at least be thrown into 
prison by her. Instead, Ryouko ordered us to be fed, brought up to one 
of her ships, and then she set us up in this fine suite. And now...&#39; 
She stopped pacing, turning to look over at the Queen&#39;s messenger.

&quot;We&#39;re invited to dinner?&quot; Ayeka repeated her softly.

The young woman nodded, She looked so much like Ryouko it was almost 
scary, with only twin scars on her face making her look any different. 
&quot;Ryouko would be very pleased if you would join her for a private 
dinner tonight. It&#39;s not required of you, but she hopes you will 
come,&quot; she said with a little smile. With that, she turned to go.

&quot;What&#39;s your name?&#39; Sasami piped up, her twin plaits of blue hair 
swinging.

She turned, smiling down at Sasami as she answered her, &quot;I&#39;m Minagi.&quot;

They quickly dressed in the traditional robes that Ryouko had provided 
for them, and at the appointed time they arrived at the ship&#39;s large 
dining hall. Minagi greeted Sasami, leading her over to a place at a 
long table, where a surprised Ayeka noticed many of the sons and 
daughters of the region&#39;s planetary rulers sat, eating cheerfully.

She was met by another young lady, blonde haired and dark of skin. 
&quot;Come with me,&quot; she said with a cheerful smile, and led Ayeka down a 
passageway.

She opened a door, leading into a smaller, more formal dining room. 
The table was set for two, with a bottle of iced wine waiting nearby. 
Ryouko herself stepped in from another door, smiling at her 
pleasantly. Her blue hair was it&#39;s normally untamed crest, her garb 
the same form fitting body suit that she often wore on the 
battlefield.

&#39;If she&#39;s doing this to try and throw me off balance,&#39; a bemused Ayeka 
thought to herself, &#39;I think she&#39;s succeeding.&#39;

&quot;Thank you, Mihoshi,&quot; Ryouko said to the other girl. She beamed over 
at Ryouko happily and nearly skipped out of the room. That is, until 
she tripped in the doorway.

&quot;Owwweee!&quot; they heard her cry, as the door clicked shut behind her.

Ryouko shook her head with a little smile, as she said, &quot;I swear, 
she&#39;s worth keeping around just for the comic relief alone.&quot; Ayeka had 
to cover her own mouth, trying to fight back her smile.

Ryouko held out a chair for Ayeka, gently pushing it in behind her, 
then she took her own seat across from her. Almost on cue, a young 
woman came in, bearing two large servings of pasta. As soon as Ayeka 
saw her, her eyes widened in surprise.

&quot;Little Asashi?&quot; Ayeka said, blinking in surprise at seeing hers and 
Sasami&#39;s old friend, here of all places. The dark hared young girl was 
dressed up as a cook, smiling quite cheerfully as she served them both 
their food.

&quot;&quot;Hello, Ayeka,&quot; she answered with a smile, putting a plate down in 
front of her. She but one in front of Ryouko, adding &quot;I hope you enjoy 
your meal.&quot; With that, she left.

&quot;She likes cooking,&quot; Ryouko said to Ayeka&#39;s curious look, &quot;so we let 
her help out, but sometimes it can be as much of a curse as a 
blessing.&quot;

Ayeka frowned thoughtfully, taking a forkful of the pasta and putting 
it in her mouth. She chewed, swallowed, then her face grew bone pale. 
She lunged for her drink.

&quot;Chew up some of your bread first,&quot; Ryouko quickly advised her, &quot;any 
liquid just seems to fuel the fire.&quot;

Mixing bread with the food helped, Ayeka had to admit as she ate with 
much more caution. She looked over at Ryouko, who was eating her own 
food with gusto, and asked softly, &quot;Why did you invite me to dinner?&quot;

A shadow seemed to pass over Ryouko&#39;s face at the question. &quot;Let&#39;s 
hold off discussing that until after dinner,&quot; she said gently. They 
ate silently for a moment, then Ryouko smiled slightly, &quot;Do you 
remember the first time we met?&quot;

A slight blush appeared on Ayeka&#39;s cheeks as she remembered what had 
happened between them, several years ago and many worlds away.



On a minor world bordering on Jurai&#39;s sphere of influence, Ayeka and a 
team of her Father&#39;s best diplomats were negotiating a mutual defense 
treaty with the planet&#39;s rulers. Ryouko&#39;s forces were advancing planet 
by planet, winning against all enemies with their vastly more advanced 
technology. The world had requested Jurai&#39;s aid to prepare for the 
coming war, when Ryouko&#39;s forces had launched an preemptive attack.

Things on the planet&#39;s surface quickly began to fall apart, and Ayeka 
found herself leading a mad scramble to try and get off-planet. They 
had to get away before Ryouko&#39;s forces could blockade the planet and 
seal off any chance of escape.

In the middle of a pitched battle Ayeka saw a scarlet energy blade 
cutting down the soldiers of the planetary forces, then she found 
herself confronted by the legendary warlord Ryouko herself. Seeing no 
other option available to her, she ignited her own golden energy blade 
and then turned to face Ryouko in battle.

The blades crossed, Ayeka found herself face to face with the warlord 
of Manticore. A smile tugged at the other woman&#39;s lips as they each 
tested the other&#39;s strength, blades flaring brightly. They fought back 
and forth, leaping up and striking against each other again and again, 
until the world exploded in light and fire all around them.

Later on, Ayeka found out that an orbital weapon, a crude laser 
cannon, had been fired on them by the planet&#39;s rulers in an attempt to 
try and kill Ryouko. But at the time all she knew then was that the 
earth disappeared around them. She suddenly fell, dropping into an the 
crater made by the explosion, and knew she was dead.

Suddenly, her descent was abruptly stopped. Ayeka looked up, her own 
wide eyes meeting the catlike eyes of Ryouko, her arm roughly help in 
the other woman&#39;s iron grip. In a single smooth motion Ryouko pulled 
her back up to the lip of the newly formed crater, her hands firmly 
holding on to Ayeka&#39;s slim shoulders. They stood there silently a 
moment, both Ayeka and Ryouko mildly stunned by this turn of events.

Then the battle caught up with them again, and they were separated by 
the crush of people. She looked up, saw Ryouko looking at her, and the 
warrior raised her blade up in a salute to Ayeka. Gravely, Ayeka did 
the same for Ryouko, and they were gone.



&quot;Yes,&quot; Ayeka said, looking over the table at Ryouko, a small smile 
teasing her lips as she continued &quot;I do remember when we first met.&quot;

The rest of the meal was very quiet, their talk mostly kept to a few 
of the more neutral topics of conversation. Finished eating, Ryouko 
moved around to where Ayeka sat, offering her hand for Ayeka to use to 
pull herself up to her feet. She stood there a moment, looking up into 
those catlike eyes, and wondered what she was thinking about.

&quot;Please follow me,&quot; Ryouko said to her simply, gently pulling at her 
hand to lead her away. They walked down the corridors of the great 
ship until they reached a viewing platform. A massive transparent 
force field extended out of the ship into the airless void itself, 
providing an wonderful view of the world below them.

A large transport ship was descending towards the planet, and others 
of the same type were lined up in orbit, waiting to descend. &quot;What are 
they carrying?&quot; Ayeka wondered aloud, worried that even more troops 
and arms were coming to her world.

&quot;Food supplies, actually,&quot; Ryouko said softly in reply. Ayeka looked 
over at her in obvious disbelief, but Ryouko just smiled back, &quot;I know 
that much of Jurai&#39;s crops were destroyed during the war. A starving 
populace is an unhappy populace, and the people will know that I fed 
them, not Jurai&#39;s rulers, their royal family.&quot;

Ayeka nodded thoughtfully, her respect increasing for Ryouko&#39;s sharp 
tactical mind. The woman always seemed to be ready for almost 
anything. She looked up at the taller woman, asking her &quot;Why am I 
here, Ryouko?&quot;

&quot;I have a rather serious problem,&quot; Ryouko said, looking out at Jurai 
and avoiding meeting Ayeka&#39;s eyes. &quot;My mother Washu predicts that 
there will be a full-blown rebellion on Jurai within a year,&quot; she 
said, giving a look at Ayeka, &quot;unless I&#39;m willing to take certain 
steps to stop it. And I&#39;ve learned to trust her predictions.&quot;

&quot;A year?&quot; Ayeka quietly echoed her. A little smile appeared as she 
said modestly, &quot;I would have expected one in only six months.&quot;

&quot;A year,&quot; Ryouko said firmly in return. &quot;Unless I choose to kill you 
and Sasami, and put a regent in. Washu thinks that way I hold on to it 
for a few years longer.&quot; She said the last totally calmly, looking out 
into the void with a serene expression on her face.

Ayeka took a step backward, her hands clenching into fists as she let 
her power build. &quot;You&#39;ll only get to Sasami over my dead body,&quot; she 
softly vowed.

Ryouko looked over at her a bit sadly, shaking her head. &quot;You let 
Sasami go off to dinner. Do you really know what I may have done with 
her?&quot; she asked with a smile.

Ayeka&#39;s face went pale. &quot;You bitch,&quot; she whispered softly, looking 
over at Ryouko in shock. She cursed herself silently for letting 
Sasami out of her sight for even a moment.

Ryouko noticed Ayeka&#39;s reaction, and she reached out to gently steady 
her. &quot;I do not kill children,&quot; she said to her shortly, &quot;not unless I 
absolutely have to.&quot; She kept a grip on Ayeka&#39;s arm, looking into her 
eyes for a moment as if she was looking for something in them. &quot;Have 
you considered what happens if your people do rebel?&quot; she suddenly 
asked.

Poor Ayeka looked honestly confused by Ryouko&#39;s question, blurting out 
automatically, &quot;We drive you off our world.&quot;

&quot;And then what?&quot; Ryouko asked her harshly, then she answered her own 
question. &quot;My ships are far superior to any technology Jurai or it&#39;s 
former allies currently has,&quot; she quietly explained. &quot;We can beat you 
in space easily, putting you right back in your place.&quot; A grim smile, 
&quot;Or even worse, we blockade Jurai and just let your people starve 
until they surrender.&quot;

Ayeka closed her eyes in a failed attempt to try and block out what 
Ryouko had said. But it was the bare truth, and as a ruler, she 
couldn&#39;t just ignore it. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be telling me all of this,&quot; 
Ayeka said to her softly, &quot;if there wasn&#39;t an alternative to propose.&quot; 
She looked up, her eyes meeting Ryouko&#39;s as she angrily said, &quot;Let&#39;s 
hear it.&quot;

Ryouko just nodded, directing her gaze back out at the planet. &quot;I&#39;m 
willing to allow Sasami to be my Regent on Jurai, ruling over the 
planet in my name. I&#39;m even willing to allow the planet to have a 
degree of independence, if you are willing to agree to my two quite 
reasonable conditions,&quot; she said, and then she smiled over at Ayeka.

&quot;And those conditions are?&quot; Ayeka asked her warily.

&quot;One,&quot; Ryouko said, looking quite serious as she held up a single 
finger, &quot;you and Sasami must pledge your loyalty to me, by your 
family&#39;s name.&quot;

Ayeka tried to hide her wince. Ryouko had done her research, that kind 
of oath could only be broken by death itself. It would guarantee their 
loyalty to her, that was for certain. &quot;And your other condition?&quot; 
Ayeka asked a bit hesitantly.

Ryouko held up two fingers. &quot;Two,&quot; and with a warmer smile this time, 
she quietly said, &quot;is even easier.&quot; She took a deep, steadying breath, 
and on letting it out she said to Ayeka in a rush, &quot;I just want us to 
get married.&quot;

Ayeka looked over at her in honest disbelief. &quot;What?!&quot; she exclaimed. </pre>
