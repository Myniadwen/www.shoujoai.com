<h1>Fallen Behind (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/fallbehind-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;STOP IT!&quot;

Ryoko froze at the cry, her sword millimeters from Bakari&#39;s forehead.  
Sasami wrestled free from Ayeka&#39;s arms and ran to where the pirates 
stood.

&quot;Please stop!&quot; Sasami begged the cyan-haired pirate, &quot;Please, don&#39;t 
kill her!&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Ryoko snarled, &quot;She kidnapped you, and even lied about 
killing you.  Why shouldn&#39;t I kill her?&quot;

&quot;Bakari didn&#39;t kidnap me.&quot; Sasami frowned, &quot;I asked her to take me with 
her.  And she wouldn&#39;t ever hurt me.  She&#39;s protecting me.&quot;  Ryoko&#39;s 
hand closed tightly around Bakari&#39;s neck, her knuckles white around her 
sword.  A strained growl leaked from her mouth, and she closed her eyes 
tightly.  The sword vanished and Ryoko threw a hard punch.  After 
giving the black-haired pirate a second black eye, Ryoko dropped 
Bakari.

&quot;I deserved that.&quot; Bakari murmured softly.

&quot;You deserve more.&quot; Ryoko growled, &quot;But if the kid doesn&#39;t want you 
killed, then I guess I can&#39;t kill you.&quot;

&quot;I do suppose it&#39;s better to stay alive and protect the little 
goddess.&quot; Bakari sighed and looked away.

&quot;What did you mean when you said that you are Tsunami&#39;s protector?&quot; 
Ayeka asked, &quot;Tsunami is the first Juraian ship.  It&#39;s safely protected 
back on Jurai.&quot;

&quot;Tsunami is the goddess of life.&quot; Bakari heaved a sigh, &quot;She is the 
protector of all life and watches over the Jurai royal family.  A very 
long time ago, Tsunami wasn&#39;t a tree.  There were no such things as 
treeships.  Life was chaotic, and Tsunami decided to intervene.  She 
assimilated with the first empress of the royal family and helped the 
empire to what it is now.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t make any sense.&quot; Ayeka protested, &quot;There is no record of 
such an empress ever existing, and there is no record of a treeship 
assimilating with a person.&quot;

&quot;Of course there&#39;s no record.  No one ever knew about the empress&#39; 
combination with Tsunami, and Tsunami became the great ship you know 
afterwards.&quot;

&quot;If you aren&#39;t making this up, then how would you know all of it?&quot; 
Washu inquired.

&quot;Because I was created when Tsunami merged with the empress.  That was 
over five hundred thousand years ago.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s impossible.&quot; Ryoko snapped, &quot;Washu&#39;s just over twenty thousand, 
and she&#39;s middle-aged.&quot;

&quot;Watch what you say about your mother.&quot; the pink-haired genius frowned 
in response, &quot;And you, little miss steal-everything-I-see, you&#39;re a bad 
liar.  You&#39;re a bad liar when you&#39;re drunk, and you&#39;re even worse when 
you&#39;re sober.&quot;

&quot;She isn&#39;t lying!&quot; Sasami stood protectively before Bakari, her arms 
outstretched, &quot;She told me everything.  She&#39;s protecting me.&quot;

&quot;Sasami, she said that she was protecting Tsunami.&quot; Minagi said gently, 
walking towards the princess slowly.

&quot;She is!&quot; Sasami cried, tears welling in her eyes, &quot;She&#39;s protecting 
me!&quot;  Her shoulders shaking, the girl sank to her knees, tears 
streaming down her face.  Minagi knelt down to comfort the girl and 
received a soul-searching stare from Bakari.  After a moment, the 
black-haired pirate looked away, and Minagi wrapped her arms around 
Sasami.

&quot;I&#39;m Tsunami.&quot; Sasami whispered, her voice strained with despair.

----------

&quot;There&#39;s no way I can demand your word that Sasami will be safe, is 
there?&quot;

&quot;Like we knew if Sasami was safe with you.&quot;

Ayeka glared angrily at the pirate across the room from her.  Bakari 
had been lashed to the wall of the cell with thick, heavy chains.  She 
stood limply in the hold of the chains, unwilling to move.

&quot;I&#39;m not lying about being Tsunami&#39;s protector.&quot; Bakari murmured, &quot;And 
I&#39;m not lying about being Sasami&#39;s protector, either.&quot;

&quot;Well, I can&#39;t very well take your word.&quot; Ayeka frowned, &quot;Besides, 
Sasami will be safe without you.  The two GP officers, Mihoshi and 
Kiyone, are allowing us to transport you back in Ryo-oh-ki while giving 
us an escort.  Washu has also graciously taken back her ship and is 
accompanying us.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; Bakari&#39;s eyes held the look of a defeated warrior, &quot;I don&#39;t 
care anymore.  Minagi could take up my post for all I care.  I&#39;ve lived 
a long time, and I&#39;m willing to give it up to pay for all the crimes 
I&#39;ve done.&quot;

&quot;This is certainly a change in attitude.&quot; Ayeka raised a brow in 
question, &quot;What happened to the murderous pirate that swore no one 
would ever capture her?&quot;

&quot;I met Sasami.&quot; Bakari closed her sore, bruised eyes, &quot;And I remembered 
why I was created.  I am the protector of the person Tsunami 
assimilates with.&quot;

&quot;Will you stop lying?&quot; Ayeka huffed, &quot;A treeship cannot assimilate with 
a person, and Tsunami is only a treeship.&quot;

&quot;Washu isn&#39;t using one of her pockets to get us back?  I can see why.  
She wants me to be in chains as long as possible.  I deserve all of this.  
Please, I have just one thing to request for this entire trip.&quot;

&quot;No, you may not have any of the alcohol that you&#39;ve stolen.&quot;

&quot;Not that.  I don&#39;t want any more whiskey or rum.  I just want to speak 
with Sasami.&quot;

&quot;I will not arrange that.  You have done enough to Sasami.&quot;

&quot;I ask you this not because I am Sasami&#39;s protector.  I beg this audience 
with the princess because I have grown to care about her.  I beg you, let 
me speak with my friend.&quot;  Ayeka heaved a sigh, but gave the pirate a 
softer glare.

&quot;Very well.&quot;

----------

&quot;If you do anything unbecoming, I will personally shoot you in the head.&quot; 
Ayeka threatened the pirate angrily, &quot;I will make Ryoko cut your throat.&quot;  
Bakari cast her eyes to the floor, a symbol of submission and defeat.  
Ayeka frowned, and turned to the door of the holding cell.  It opened, 
revealing Ryoko, Minagi, Washu, Mihoshi, Kiyone, and Sasami leading the 
group.

The blue-green-haired princess ran forward and wrapped her arms around 
Bakari&#39;s waist, sobbing into her stomach.  Bakari looked away, her hands 
still limp in the manacles&#39; hold.  She stood against the wall, her arms 
barely able to move from the short, thick chains.

&quot;Ayeka, please, let Bakari go!&quot; Sasami turned to her sister, her face 
dripping with tears, &quot;I don&#39;t want her to go to jail!  She shouldn&#39;t have 
to go!&quot;

&quot;Sasami, please listen.&quot; Bakari said gently, &quot;I should be going to jail.  
I should have gone to jail a long time ago.  I&#39;ve killed over five hundred 
people.  I&#39;ve stolen enough to fill this entire ship.  I even took you 
from your home.&quot;

&quot;No you DIDN&#39;T!&quot; Sasami sobbed, &quot;I went with you!  I asked you to take me 
with you!&quot;

&quot;Sasami, what did you say?&quot; Ayeka was stunned.

&quot;I asked Bakari to take me with her!&quot; the princess said hurriedly, &quot;I 
don&#39;t want to be a princess anymore!  I want to be just a normal person!&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean you should ask a murderous pirate to take you with 
her!&quot; Ayeka was indignant, &quot;You could have been killed!&quot;

&quot;Bakari&#39;s nice!&quot; Sasami protested, &quot;She&#39;s been protecting me and teaching 
me!&quot;

&quot;Teaching you?&quot; Ayeka turned beet red.  Her hands stiffened, her teeth 
grit.  A sharp twitch appeared in her eye, and she ran forwards.  Bakari 
choked as Ayeka&#39;s fist landed heavily on her throat.  A sickening crack 
rang in the room.  Ayeka gasped in terror at her action, realizing that 
she had just broken Bakari&#39;s neck with a punch.

Sasami&#39;s eyes widened in horror, her mouth dropped.  Bakari coughed once, 
blood running down her chin.  She grimaced, closing her eyes tightly.  A 
pop rang out, and Bakari coughed again.

&quot;I deserved that too.&quot; the black-haired pirate groaned, &quot;Could you avoid 
doing that again, please?  The little goddess doesn&#39;t like blood.&quot;

&quot;Oh, my...&quot; Ayeka turned pale.  She started to waver, her knees giving 
out.  Ryoko caught her and kept her standing, staring in shock at Bakari.

&quot;Yes, this is why I actually still have these black eyes from Ryoko and 
Washu.&quot; Bakari heaved a sigh at all the dumbfounded looks, Sasami hugging 
her tight again, &quot;I am not only the protector of the goddess Tsunami, I am 
her weapon.  I can&#39;t be hurt badly except by a goddess or by the weapon of 
a goddess.  Like Ryoko, Minagi, or Washu.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Minagi questioned.

&quot;I can&#39;t explain it because you won&#39;t believe me!&quot; Bakari snapped, her 
eyes growing angry, &quot;I don&#39;t know why I even bothered to ask to talk to 
Sasami!&quot;

/Perhaps you should allow me to speak./

All present looked to Sasami.  The marks on her forehead glowed green, 
suddenly turning from inverted triangles to twin circles.  The room 
vanished into black, and began to shine a light blue.  A drop of water 
fell into a larger pool, ripples sweeping over the floor.  Each women 
stood on small patches of earth in the water.  Sasami stood beside Bakari, 
who was free of her restraints, on a large, square space of earth, her 
hands clasped over her chest as if in prayer.

An ethereal figure hovered over Sasami, her hands also closed over her 
chest.  She too had the twin circles of dark blue on her forehead, and the 
same blue-green hair as Sasami.  Her eyes opened slowly, revealing deep, 
shining pink, exactly as Sasami&#39;s.

/I ask of you all to listen./ the ethereal figure said, /I am Tsunami./  
Bakari&#39;s gray eyes grew wide and she fell to one knee, bowing her head to 
Sasami and the figure of the goddess above her.

/You all deserve to know the events that caused my faithful guardian to 
turn to such violence./ Tsunami said in her gentle voice.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t protect the first empress of Jurai.  I do not deserve to be 
known as your guardian any further, milady.&quot; Bakari murmured, her head 
still bowed in reverence.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on here?&quot; Ryoko demanded, &quot;Where are we?&quot;  She 
struggled only a moment when Ayeka pressed a gentle hand over her mouth.

&quot;Ryoko, please.&quot; the crown princess whispered, &quot;We are in the presence of 
Tsunami, the most powerful ship on Jurai.  And it seems...we are in the 
presence of a goddess.&quot;

/Princess Ayeka, there&#39;s no need to fear me./ Tsunami said with a soft 
smile, /I am here to tell you of the past, and to speak for Bakari./

&quot;Milady, no!&quot; Bakari protested, standing in shock, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t taint 
your name by speaking for me!  I&#39;m a murderer and a pathetic drunk!  
Please, I don&#39;t deserve to be called your guardian anymore!&quot;

/Shh, Bakari./ Tsunami lay a gentle finger over Bakari&#39;s lip, proving the 
goddess was not a mere image, but real, /You have proven faithful through 
all these years, and I will not forsake you./  The pirate gulped and 
nodded, falling silent.  The goddess smiled and closed her eyes once more.  
The room vanished in light and soon showed the image of Jurai from space.

/This is how Jurai looked when everything began./ Tsunami&#39;s voice echoed 
in the eerie silence, /When sentient human life began.  My two sisters and 
I knew that Jurai would be at the center of the universe, the greatest 
royal power./

&quot;Sisters?&quot; Minagi asked.

&quot;She means the two other goddesses.&quot; Washu murmured as if it were 
completely obvious, a smug smirk on her face.

/Yes.  My sisters Tokimi, and you, Washu.  I can see why you call yourself 
the greatest scientific genius in the universe.  You&#39;re the goddess of 
knowledge after all./  Washu stared at Tsunami in confusion.  /I will 
explain everything, sister./  The image changed from a view of Jurai to 
the luscious forestry of the planet&#39;s surface, where a clearing was 
growing larger.  A tall, slender woman stood by as someone cut some trees 
down.  The woman had long brown hair, and eyes the same sweet chocolate 
color.  Twin circles of dark blue lay on her forehead.

&#39;Why is it that you stop after you cut down every tree?&#39; the slender woman 
asked.  The gleam of a dark blue energy sword faded at the woman&#39;s words, 
and the worker pulled the hood over their head away.  Bakari, the past 
image of her, smiled at the woman.

&#39;Even trees have life, Lady Useni.&#39; the past Bakari said, &#39;We should pay 
our respects.&#39;

&#39;I suppose you&#39;re right.&#39; the woman smiled at Bakari, &#39;I am glad that 
they&#39;re giving their lives for us.&#39;

&#39;More or less, milady.&#39; Bakari rubbed her head sheepishly, &#39;Mostly for 
your shelter until I can carve stone without you having to sleep 
outdoors.&#39;

&#39;You spoil me, Bakari!&#39; Useni giggled and wrapped her arms around Bakari&#39;s 
neck, &#39;I thought you were only my protector!&#39;

&#39;Protection isn&#39;t all fighting off beasts.&#39; Bakari smiled in return, 
&#39;Nature can be fairly unforgiving as well.&#39;

&#39;You&#39;re such a sweetheart.&#39; Useni planted a kiss on Bakari&#39;s cheek, &#39;I&#39;ll 
be back at the settlement.  Please hurry back.&#39;  As the vision of the past 
faded with a blushing Bakari resuming her work, everyone turned to the 
present pirate.

&quot;Who was that?&quot; Mihoshi asked of the woman with long brown hair.

/That was the first empress of Jurai, Useni./ Tsunami replied, /The vision 
was of the time when Bakari was helping to create the lands that would 
become the royal palace and protecting the peoples of Jurai from the 
beasts that dominated the land./  The goddess looked towards Bakari, and 
found her turned away from everyone.  Tsunami knew there was no way to get 
around facing the past and telling the tales if Bakari&#39;s life was to be 
proven worthy to keep, so she pressed on.

The shadowy place was illuminated one again, this time revealing a time 
much later than before.  General workers crafted houses from stone, and 
the populace had grown by much.  Two thousand years had passed from the 
last vision.  It was nighttime.  The view changed to within a private room 
in the palace, where the empress Useni sat in a chair.  Bakari stood by 
the doorway, her hood over her head once again.

&#39;Bakari, can you come here, please?&#39;  Bakari obediently walked to stand 
beside the chair Useni sat in.

&#39;How are my children?&#39; Useni asked.

&#39;Both sons and both daughters are asleep.&#39;

&#39;And my husband is on a diplomatic mission on the next continent?&#39;

&#39;Yes, milady.&#39;

&#39;Good.&#39;  Useni stood up and wrapped her arms around Bakari&#39;s neck, kissing 
her on the mouth.  Bakari visibly stiffened, her eyes wide.  Useni&#39;s eyes 
closed slightly in the embrace, her eyes locked on Bakari&#39;s.

&#39;M-milady, you shouldn&#39;t...&#39; Bakari blushed when Useni broke the kiss.

&#39;Why?&#39; Useni lay a gentle kiss on Bakari&#39;s cheek, &#39;I&#39;ve loved you for so 
long.  The only reason you aren&#39;t my bedmate is because royal blood needs 
to be passed.  Now that my children are born, I don&#39;t see why we shouldn&#39;t 
just run away.&#39;

&#39;Milady, I can&#39;t...&#39;

&#39;Why not?&#39;

&#39;I don&#39;t know.&#39;

&#39;Then you can.  Do you love me?&#39;

&#39;...yes.&#39;

&#39;Then you can.&#39;  The vision faded as Useni kissed Bakari again.

/That was how things were./ Tsunami said gently as the place turned back 
to the water-filled emptiness.  A drop echoed in the stunned silence.  
Bakari&#39;s hands were clenched so tightly that she had broken her own skin, 
blood falling in a stream drip from her white knuckles.  She was visibly 
tense as she had been in the past vision, her shoulders twitching.

/Bakari, please, this last memory is all I ask of you now./  The place 
vanished in light, turning to a sunny day only a short time from the last 
vision.

&#39;I&#39;m dismissing Bakari.  She may be your bodyguard, but that&#39;s no reason 
for how she&#39;s been acting.&#39;

&#39;What do you mean, Ryokan?&#39; Useni asked her husband, the emperor.

&#39;She&#39;s been raping you.  Why haven&#39;t you told me about this?&#39;

&#39;Ryokan, Bakari hasn&#39;t been doing anything.  What in the world are you 
talking about?&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s all right, my dear.  She&#39;ll be gone from our lives in just a 
moment.&#39;  At those words, four guards appeared from the palace, Bakari 
struggled against them.

&#39;What the hell are you doing?!&#39; Bakari shouted, &#39;Let me go!  What are you 
doing?!&#39;

&#39;For the good of the kingdom, Bakari.&#39; the emperor sighed, drawing his 
standard laser pistol.  He aimed for Bakari&#39;s head, the black-haired woman 
frowning.

&#39;NO!&#39; Useni shouted, leaping for her husband&#39;s arm.  The shot missed 
Bakari&#39;s head but still hit her in the chest.  Useni&#39;s eyes widened in 
shock and she ran to Bakari.  Before Useni could reach her, Bakari 
summoned her blade and cut the guards down, the wound on her chest 
healing.  The black-haired woman pulled Useni to stand behind her, her 
sword raised.

&#39;I&#39;m supposed to protect you.&#39; she murmured over her shoulder, &#39;Not the 
other way around.  Don&#39;t worry about me.&#39;

&#39;Bakari, I love you, and I&#39;m not going to live my life without you.&#39; Useni 
held the back of Bakari&#39;s cloak tightly, her face against Bakari&#39;s back.

&#39;It&#39;s all right, Useni.  I love you too.  Don&#39;t worry.&#39;  A sharp pain 
erupted from her stomach and Bakari knew that another guard had stabbed an 
energy sword through her.  Useni&#39;s hands closed tighter on her cloak for a 
moment, then loosened and let go altogether.  The sword vanished, and 
Bakari turned to see why Useni had let go.

Her gray eyes widened.  Blood slid slowly from Useni&#39;s mouth, her heart 
pierced from the sword.  The empress blinked and fell against Bakari.  The 
black-haired woman caught Useni and fell to her knees, eyes wide and 
unblinking.

&#39;Useni...&#39; Bakari whispered, &#39;No...this wasn&#39;t supposed to happen.&#39;  Useni 
just shook her head, a sad smile on her face.

&#39;I&#39;ll always love you.&#39; Useni said, her hand weakly caressing Bakari&#39;s 
cheek.  Her eyes closed slowly, and her breathing stopped.  Bakari&#39;s eyes 
widened and tears began to fall.

&#39;No...&#39; she choked out, &#39;No, Tsunami, don&#39;t let this happen.  Don&#39;t let 
her die!  No!  NO!  USENI!  NNNNOOOOOOO!&#39;  The guard and the emperor 
advanced on Bakari as she sobbed.  Bakari held both hands up, either palm 
facing either man.  A shot of energy burst forth from the marks on her 
hands, the marks that signified she was Tsunami&#39;s protector.  The men were 
killed instantly.

&#39;Useni...&#39; tears fell upon Useni&#39;s face as Bakari shed them, &#39;You 
shouldn&#39;t have died.  I failed to protect you.  This is my fault.&#39;

&quot;It was.&quot;  The vision was broken suddenly, pulling the group back to the 
present.  The person who had spoken was none other than Bakari, her voice 
strangely calm.

&quot;It was my fault that Useni died.&quot; the pirate said softly.

/You cannot blame yourself for what happened./ Tsunami&#39;s voice was gentle, 
forgiving, /And Useni didn&#39;t blame you for what happened.  No one blames 
you except yourself./

&quot;They should.&quot; Bakari&#39;s voice grew harsh, &quot;And I shouldn&#39;t be worried 
about.  It&#39;s my fault that people die, and there&#39;s no way around that.&quot;

/Did you ever know the backgrounds of the people that died at your blade?  
Did you ever realize that Ryoko and Minagi have killed people as well?  
You are all the same.  The people that have died were all corrupted./

&quot;A life is a life.&quot; Bakari snapped, &quot;No one has the right to take one.  
Not even a goddess.&quot;

/We are the ones who make death./

&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Bakari turned to face the goddess she was guardian to, 
tears on her face, &quot;If you make death, then why do you allow people to die 
without reason?!&quot;

/I do not make death.  I see whose life is fit to end./

&quot;Then why did you let Useni die?!&quot;

/Because Useni knew it was her time and place./

&quot;I don&#39;t believe that!&quot;

/Useni didn&#39;t want to die slowly in old age.  She didn&#39;t want you to watch 
her wither away.  You&#39;re going to live for a long time./  Bakari fell to 
her knees, her head bent in despair.

&quot;...how long is half of forever?&quot;
