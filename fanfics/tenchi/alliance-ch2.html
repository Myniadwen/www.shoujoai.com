<h1>Alliance (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rann.html">Rann Aridorn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/alliance-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Ayeka groaned quietly as she awoke, her temples pounding faintly, 
everything seeming blurry in the wan light of the bedroom. Confused at 
her surroundings, but not yet awake enough to be startled, she opened 
her eyes fully, letting them focus on a guest bedroom that seemed 
overly lavish in its trappings, a bit gaudy. She was lying on a large 
bed, covered by fine silk sheets, and was relieved to find that she 
had been undressed only to her undermost kimono, even if the garment 
was rather thin. She sat up, taking in the way the light made 
everything appear in dim blue monochrome, before looking around.

&quot;Mother? Kiyone? Sasami?&quot; She called quietly, eyes a little wide. 
After a very long, silent moment, she even ventured, &quot;Mihoshi?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re all still downstairs talking things over... well, most of 
them are,&quot; came a throaty, almost purring voice from beside the bed.

Ayeka almost yelped and scooted quickly to one side, the whites around 
her eyes plainly showing as she clutched the sheet to herself 
fearfully. The Hyurodan princess Ryoko leaned forward out of a large 
patch of shadow beside the head of the bed, smiling rather wickedly, 
her yellow eyes glittering with amusement.

&quot;Your little sister went to bed early, and I kicked your cute servant 
out of the room, so I don&#39;t know where she is. Maybe she went down to 
the barracks to entertain the guards.&quot;

Ayeka scowled, indignation rising to overshadow her fear. &quot;I&#39;ll thank 
you not to talk about Kiyone that way, she&#39;s a loyal lady-in-waiting, 
and would not do such a shameless thing.&quot;

&quot;Ooooo, sounds like someone&#39;s got a little thing going on with the 
help,&quot; Ryoko cooed, rising to her feet and resting one hand on her 
hip.

The Juraian princess flushed with anger and embarrassment. &quot;I&#39;ve no 
such thing! I would NEVER-&quot;

&quot;Oh, you should sometime, it&#39;s loads of fun,&quot; the other princess 
interrupted, almost seeming to ooze forward onto the bed on her hands 
and knees, leaning forward to lock eyes with the other girl. Ayeka 
opened her mouth, but found herself silent, again experiencing a 
sensation not unlike a small animal mesmerized by the gaze of a snake.

&quot;I... I...&quot; Ayeka gulped several times, trying to recover her voice.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, sweety? I&#39;m your fiance, after all... you 
shouldn&#39;t be so scared to death of me.&quot; Ryoko&#39;s voice was now 
definitely a purr, and she slunk closer slowly, like a tiger moving in 
for the kill.

&quot;B-b-b-but you can&#39;t marry me!&quot; Ayeka squeaked, trying to scoot back 
further the closer Ryoko came. &quot;We&#39;re both women! Juraian culture is 
polygamous, but not in that manner!&quot;

&quot;In case you haven&#39;t noticed, princess, we&#39;re all women here.&quot; Ryoko 
smirked even more broadly, showing off sharp incisors. &quot;I imagine 
they&#39;ll come up with some nice, neat little amalgamation of Juraian 
and Hyurodan culture that will have us in wedded bliss in no time.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t possibly get married! We&#39;ve only just met!&quot; Ayeka felt 
absurdly pleased that she had managed that without stuttering or her 
voice breaking. It made her feel a little better about grasping at 
straws.

Ryoko gave a low, throaty laugh, amber eyes almost seeming to flash in 
amusement at that. &quot;Oh, come on, even I know that that doesn&#39;t matter 
with royalty. It&#39;s an arranged marriage, and though I don&#39;t exactly 
want to be tied down...&quot; These last two words had a certain emphasis 
that made Ayeka feel like squirming, but she repressed the urge. &quot;I&#39;ll 
go along with it... you&#39;re pretty enough, and if I&#39;m lucky, maybe I&#39;ll 
get another wife or two out of the deal, too.&quot;

The Juraian girl opened her mouth to snap back the first witty reply 
that came to mind, but all that came out was a surprised and dismayed 
shriek as she fell off of the bed. She landed in a tumble of sheets 
and her kimono, tears springing to her eyes at the sharp thump on her 
posterior. She fought her way out of the entangling blankets, then 
stared in disbelief at Ryoko rolling around on the bed, hands on her 
stomach, laughing.

Disbelief turned to anger quickly, all her frustration and annoyance 
at the situation boiling to the surface, and with an enraged cry she 
flung herself at the other woman, hands going for her throat. Ryoko 
seemed surprised for a few moments as her new fiance attempted to 
throttle her, then grinned ferally and fought back with a will.

They rolled around on the bed, shouting curses and taunts at one 
another, grappling without any real thought in mind but to do damage 
to the other. Ayeka found, to her dismay, that Ryoko was indeed 
amazingly strong, but her own Juraian physiology allowed her to at 
least be competitive. She felt her breath leave her in one long huff 
as Ryoko got a knee against her stomach, and retaliated with a 
stinging slap that left the other princess&#39; cheek cherry red. Ryoko 
just continued to smirk fangily and fight back, apparently in earnest, 
grabbing for Ayeka&#39;s wrists and trying to pin her.

Ayeka kicked and shrieked, not caring that she was fighting like an 
angry child in school, and sank her teeth into Ryoko&#39;s upper arm. The 
Hyurodan princess yelped in pain and surprise, grip loosening enough 
that Ayeka could break it and roll them over, sitting up and wrapping 
her hands around Ryoko&#39;s throat. The cyan-haired woman growled, hands 
shooting up and grabbing the neck of Ayeka&#39;s kimono, trying to yank 
her to one side with it.

Suddenly, the lights came on, flooding the room from monochrome into 
brilliant reds, yellows, and purples. Both princesses blinked 
repeatedly in surprise, momentarily distracted from their attempts to 
kill each other, and looked over at the door. Empress Misaki blinked 
several times, finger still resting on the touchplate that had turned 
on the lights.

&quot;... Oh my,&quot; Misaki murmured after a moment. &quot;Ayeka, you really should 
wait until the wedding night. Or at least be a little more quiet when 
you&#39;re making love, I heard you two all the way downstairs.&quot;

Ayeka&#39;s jaw dropped, gawking at her mother, rosy color quickly 
spreading over her cheeks and the bridge of her nose. &quot;M-mother! This 
isn&#39;t what it looks like at all, it&#39;s-!&quot; She looked down, then gawked 
again. Unnoticed during the fight, the belt of her kimono had come 
untied, and Ryoko&#39;s grabbing the neckline had made the front of the 
garment open completely, baring Ayeka&#39;s firm breasts and flat stomach, 
her crotch barely concealed by the angle at which she was leaning on 
the other princess. Ryoko&#39;s garments, too, had come almost undone 
during the fight, showing the upper slopes of her breasts and small 
swatches of dark red areola.

The Hyurodan woman angled her head, noticing what was making her 
unwilling fiance blush so much, and smiled broadly. &quot;Well, hey, if 
it&#39;s Juraian tradition to let your mom watch the first time, honey, I 
don&#39;t mind. Pull up a chair, Empress.&quot;

Ayeka wouldn&#39;t have thought there could BE anything more embarrassing, 
except that Misaki proceeded to walk over and pull around the chair 
Ryoko had been sitting in, leaning forward and resting her elbows on 
her knees and chin in her hands.

&quot;Thank you, dear, I hope you don&#39;t mind a little advice.&quot;

&quot;MOTHER!&quot; Ayeka wailed, practically launching herself back from Ryoko 
and yanking her kimono closed.

&quot;Okay, okay, I&#39;ll stay quiet...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Sasami lay in her bed, quite awake as she lay on her side and gazed at 
nothing in particular. She tried to snuggle further down in the comfy 
sheets, but couldn&#39;t help listening as, a few doors away, Ayeka 
shouted something long and rather angry at someone. Then there was the 
sound of a slamming door, and then the faint sound of Ayeka muttering 
to herself as she walked down the hall. The young princess sighed as 
her sister&#39;s voice faded completely, and silence descended again.

If she tried, she could just barely hear Mihoshi snoring in the next 
room, as well as a much fainter rythmic thumping... sounded a little 
like someone was pacing. Sasami wondered if getting up and pacing 
would help her sort things out. Her sister was now engaged to someone 
that she obviously didn&#39;t like very much, despite not knowing her. 
Sasami herself rather admired Princess Ryoko; she was beautiful, 
sensual, exotic, and said exactly what she felt and thought. The young 
princess wished mightily that she could be all those things when she 
got older, even though it was probably impossible.

But her thoughts kept inevitably returning to what Queen Washu had 
said. The Empire was going to collapse? That had no real meaning for 
Sasami, other than that it would be a bad thing for her family, and 
that people would get hurt, both things that made her heart squeeze up 
inside her like a wet piece of tissue crushed in someone&#39;s hand. But 
everyone seemed to think that Ayeka and Ryoko getting married would 
make everything all right again, or at least it seemed that way to 
her. So it confused her deeply that Ayeka would react this way.

Sighing, Sasami rolled over onto her back, hands at her sides atop the 
covers. &#39;Ayeka... I can see in Ryoko&#39;s heart that she&#39;s a good person. 
I have to figure out some way to make you see that, but how? You never 
listen to me...&#39;

The little princess let her mind wander, going over various things to 
say or do that would show her sister that this really would be a good 
match. Sasami often found herself getting a sense from people around 
her, as if for a moment everything about them was stripped away, and 
she was seeing their deepest inner core, their potential even. And she 
knew, she KNEW that Ayeka and Ryoko would be right together... she had 
to make them, both of them, understand just how much!

She pondered that for a moment, idly giggling a little. Getting her 
fingers licked tickled! She thought for a moment more, then blinked. 
Fingers licked? She yelped in surprise, yanking her hand back and 
sitting up, looking down at the side of the bed in fright. Whatever it 
was gave a strange little cry and zipped under one of the pillows.

&quot;W-what is that...? Who&#39;s there?&quot; Sasami whispered, voice shaking.

The lump in the pillow moved a bit, then a very quiet, almost shy 
little voice answered, &quot;Mya.&quot;

Blinking, fear quickly receding and replaced by curiosity, Sasami 
leaned over and lifted the pillow. Whatever it was was curled up in a 
little brown ball. As the princess lifted the pillow, its ears sprang 
up as if they&#39;d been held down, long ears with big tufts of white fur 
in them. After a moment, two little paws lifted, revealing 
yellow-brown eyes and an ovalur red gem on a brown-furred forehead.

&quot;... Mya?&quot;

&quot;Oh, wow, it&#39;s a cabbit!&quot; Sasami cried, delighted. She reached out one 
hand slowly, not wanting to startle the rare creature again. &quot;Hey 
there little guy...&quot; She smiled even more brightly as it allowed her 
to touch it, and set up a low, thrumming purr as she started 
scratching it behind one ear.

&quot;Little girl, actually.&quot;

Sasami jumped just a little, which startled the cabbit again, though 
this time it ran into the little princess&#39; lap with an almost 
protective &quot;Mya!&quot; However, once it saw the Hyurodan queen standing 
beside the bed, it seemed to relax, curling up in Sasami&#39;s lap 
contentedly.

&quot;Queen Washu, please don&#39;t scare me like that,&quot; Sasami murmured, 
putting a hand to her chest.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Washu said brightly, sitting down on the side of the bed. 
&quot;I was just looking for Ryo-Ohki, and I felt her in here with you.&quot;

&quot;Ryo-Ohki?&quot; Sasami looked down, and carefully bundled the small animal 
up into her arms. It happily licked her chin, setting her to giggling. 
&quot;Is she yours...?&quot;

&quot;Actually, she&#39;s Ryoko&#39;s, but I like to keep an eye on her. She&#39;s an 
attention hog, and sometimes she bothers guests.&quot; Washu seemed vastly 
amused as the cabbit stuck its tongue out of her, then snuggled deeper 
into Sasami&#39;s arms. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what, you keep her.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; Sasami replied, eyes going wide, though she couldn&#39;t keep her 
eagerness out of her voice. But after a moment, she shook her head. &quot;I 
couldn&#39;t, Queen Washu. It&#39;s wonderful of you to offer, but she&#39;s 
Ryoko&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Ah, that&#39;s okay, Ryoko hardly ever plays with her anymore. Besides, 
seems a pretty fair trade to me, a cabbit for a big sister.&quot; Smirking, 
Washu reached out to ruffle the princess&#39; hair.

Sasami giggled again, then caved. &quot;Alright, Queen Washu. Thank you 
very much!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome!&quot; Washu poked Ryo-Ohki in the side with one finger. 
&quot;Hear that, you? You belong to Sasami now, so you&#39;d better obey her, 
y&#39;hear?&quot;

&quot;Mya!&quot; the cabbit answered, definitely in the affirmative.

------------------------------------------------------------

Funaho stared into the mirror as she brushed her hair, carefully 
keeping her calm demeanor up, not wanting to further upset Misaki. The 
other woman was in tears over the whole thing, but more over Ayeka 
getting angry and yelling at her. Misaki was very emotional, and that 
tended to be even moreso where it came to her daughters. Right now, 
the other woman was fluttering about the room, reminding Funaho of a 
wounded bird, making her want to take Misaki in her hands and hold her 
until she&#39;d calmed. After a few minutes, she got up and did exactly 
that.

&quot;She&#39;s going to hate us forever!&quot; Misaki sobbed into her co-wife&#39;s 
shoulder, clinging tightly to Funaho, as if afraid to let the other 
woman go for fear of drowning in her tears.

&quot;Sssshhhh, sssshhhhh... she won&#39;t, Misaki, she won&#39;t.&quot; Funaho stroked 
the other woman&#39;s hair softly. &quot;She may be angry for a long time, but 
she won&#39;t hate us. Eventually she&#39;ll see this has to be done.&quot;

&quot;I wish Azusa was here,&quot; Misaki sniffled.

&quot;I do, too... I can&#39;t help thinking he might have found a better way.&quot; 
After a moment, Funaho sighed. &quot;No, I have to admit, he&#39;d probably 
agree... this engagement is the only way. I suppose he&#39;ll tell me 
whether I&#39;m right or deserve to be put in the stocks.&quot;

Misaki cheered a little bit, looking at Funaho in amusement. &quot;They 
haven&#39;t used stocks on Jurai in a dozen generations.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not true. Remember last year on Azusa&#39;s birthday?&quot;

The blue-haired Empress flushed bright red, looking up at her co-wife. 
&quot;Um, well, I suppose that&#39;s a point. I meant more as a punishment...&quot;

&quot;We both punished you rather thoroughly, I think, though I can&#39;t 
recall what exactly you did to deserve it one way or the other...&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Misaki replied cleverly, still very red. &quot;Well, I...&quot;

Laughing softly, Funaho placed a finger against Misaki&#39;s lips softly, 
then removed it and replaced it with her own lips. As the kiss 
lingered, Misaki&#39;s blush faded, her body relaxing, clinging hands 
sliding around the other woman&#39;s body in a tight embrace. In perfect 
unison, they fell to one side onto the bed, still kissing, tongues 
stroking over one another in a slow dance.

&quot;Feeling a little better now?&quot; Funaho murmured when they came up for 
air, hands languidly undressing her co-wife.

&quot;Mmm-hmm,&quot; Misaki cooed, a little more exuberant in tugging and 
pulling at Funaho&#39;s underkimono. She paused for a moment, seeming 
distracted. &quot;What DID we get Azusa for his birthday...?&quot;

&quot;We got him the stocks, of course...&quot;

Misaki broke into laughter, which only grew louder as Funaho started 
tickling her, the blue-haired Empress&#39; shapely body writhing under 
deft fingers. Eventually, the laughter turned into soft moans, which 
were soon muffled by a kiss. Someone managed to reach over and hit a 
touch panel before they became too entangled in one another&#39;s limbs to 
do so, and darkness and the sounds of pleasure and comfort filled the 
room.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ayeka composed herself a bit, straightening her underkimono and 
wishing that she&#39;d taken the time to grab one of the outer layers 
before storming out of her guest room. She was afraid to go back now, 
afraid that Ryoko would be there... though that fear had several 
levels, some of which she absolutely refused to acknowledge. She 
raised one hand to knock on the door of the room where her mother and 
Funaho were staying, then just barely stayed her hand as a cry of 
release came from the other side. Flushing with embarrassment, Ayeka 
hurried off back down the hall.

She walked out of the archway at the end of the hall, onto a wide 
circular balcony. Sighing, she rested her hands on the cool stone 
railing, gazing out at the night. So unlike Jurai... a tiny little 
city, barely more than a town, and stretching beyond that, nothing but 
rocky land. She wondered if it had always been this way, or if it had 
happened in the war Kiyone had mentioned.

&#39;What a desolate place. Perhaps they need us as much as they say we 
need them.&#39;

She shivered slightly at a sudden cold breeze, trying to draw her thin 
garment closer around her. She remained where she was, shivering, 
staring at the stars and trying to think things out. She raised her 
head in surprise as one of her warmer outer kimonos was draped around 
her shoulders, turning to see Ryoko standing beside her.

The Hyurodan princess moved to the railing, leaning her hands on it 
and gazing off at the distance. &quot;If you&#39;re not smart enough to come in 
out of the cold, it&#39;s no business of mine, I just don&#39;t want to be 
bothered by you sneezing all day and night when you get sick.&quot;

Ayeka hmphed in annoyance, turning her head away. &quot;My health is my own 
business, thank you very much.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; Ryoko snorted, apparently having exhausted her 
desire to press her suit for the night. She turned and walks towards 
the entryway with a little flick of her hand in parting.

&quot;... Wait,&quot; Ayeka murmured quietly.

Ryoko paused in the doorway, turning halfway to face the other 
princess. &quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;... Was it always like this?&quot; Ayeka tilted her head a bit, indicating 
the desert surrounding the city.

&quot;Barren, y&#39;mean?&quot; Ryoko moved back to stand beside the other woman, 
resting her hands on her hips. &quot;Nope. Used to be a lot of jungles all 
over the planet. Not a lotta big trees like on Jurai, just... lotsa 
plants and stuff.&quot;

&quot;How did it become this way...?&quot;

&quot;Some people came in... wanted our planets, wanted us. Wanted to take 
us as slaves, just like every alien race&#39;s tried to do at some 
point...&quot;

&quot;Oh... I see,&quot; Ayeka whispered.

Ryoko grinned ferally. &quot;So, my mother and I got everyone together, and 
we slaughtered every last one of &#39;em. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single 
Terran left anymore.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Ayeka repeated, this time with a small gulp.

&quot;But by then, the planet was pretty screwed up. It&#39;ll take another 
thousand years or so before it&#39;s back to anything like normal.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps we can find a way to help you,&quot; the Juraian said, then 
blinked in surprise at her own words.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Ryoko turned, resting an arm on the railing and leaning in, 
leering up at Ayeka. &quot;That mean you&#39;re gonna marry me?&quot;

Ayeka flushed a bit, then looked away, not speaking until she was sure 
she had composed ourself. &quot;My own personal... preferences must be set 
aside, for the good of my people, and for the good of yours.&quot; And if 
she didn&#39;t believe it, she could at least repeat the words and follow 
their command.

Ryoko snorted again before pushing herself up and heading inside. 
&quot;Sure. Whatever. See you in the morning, Ayeka.&quot;

Ayeka looked over her shoulder at the departing girl, then turned her 
head back towards the city, clutching the kimono closer around her. 
After a moment, she lowered her head, bangs casting her eyes into 
shadow. Slowly, and ever so slightly, her lips curved into a tiny 
smile.

&quot;... I will see you in the morning, Ryoko.&quot;
