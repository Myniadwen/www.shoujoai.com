------------------------------------------------------------ 

Kiyone and Mihoshi sat across from each other in the Galaxy Police 
Headquarters dining hall. Before going back to the ship and supplying 
the information about her past as Mimuri Harushi, she&#39;d insisted on 
getting something to eat first. 

&quot;I mean sure Sasami makes great food, but sometimes you get a craving 
for slop.&quot; Mihoshi said cheerfully. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kiyone said absently. Only a few minutes before they&#39;d been 
close to being reassigned and sent to retraining... and now they had a 
raise. Her superior had been left speechless and Mitsuki had been in 
shock. What had Mihoshi said in there to cause a reaction like that? 
Suddenly she realized that Mihoshi had piled some food onto her tray. 
&quot;Oh, thanks.&quot; 

Mihoshi smiled in her usual vacuous way and said, &quot;It&#39;s not a problem 
Kiyone. Come on, I see an empty table.&quot; 

Kiyone followed behind her staring into space. When she suddenly 
bumped into Mihoshi she ended up spilling everything onto the floor. 
Her usual response kicked in. &quot;Mihoshi, what did you do that for?&quot; 

&quot;Milloi.&quot; Mihoshi&#39;s voice was a whisper. 

The name rung a bell and Kiyone looked up. There was a tall man with a 
crew cut standing about ten feet away looking at them. Finally he 
walked forward. &quot;Hello Mi... Mihoshi is it now?&quot; He smiled and said, 
&quot;I should have known. Who else could get so infamous?&quot; 

&quot;Hello Milloi. How&#39;s Trish?&quot; Mihoshi asked coldly. Kiyone noticed that 
she&#39;d slipped back into her more focused personality. 

&quot;We broke up about six months after. You?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m seeing Kiyone now.&quot; She said. 

Kiyone smiled nervously, unsure of what to say. Neither of them was 
blinking and Milloi didn&#39;t look at her. So Kiyone took the initiative 
and stepped forward. &quot;That would be me... the one with all my food on 
the floor.&quot; She extended her and for a shake. 

Milloi looked at her and gripped her hand. &quot;Hmm, strong handshake. I 
can see who the man is in this relationship.&quot; 

Kiyone&#39;s eyes narrowed. Mitsuki had said something like that to her 
before. &quot;And I can see why Mihoshi dumped you.&quot; 

&quot;Is that what she told you?&quot; He asked, sounding amused and letting her 
hand go. 

Kiyone flinched and remembered the story Mihoshi had told. &quot;No.&quot; 

&quot;Nice of you to defend her honor though.&quot; 

&quot;Well we all make mistakes.&quot; She realized that she was now staring at 
him unblinking. Shaking her head she stepped back and grinned. &quot;Oh 
very nice!&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; He asked. 

&quot;You must work at that. You piss people off just enough for a face 
off. Gives you a chance to see how they react. I&#39;ll bet you knew most 
of it before I even said anything though.&quot; He wasn&#39;t smirking any 
more. &quot;Mihoshi is much better at it.&quot; 

&quot;She always was.&quot; He glanced of Kiyone&#39;s shoulder. She turned around 
just in time to see Mihoshi wipe something off of her cheek. &quot;But she 
never could control her emotions could you?&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; Mihoshi said coldly. She set her tray down on a nearby table. 
&quot;Come on Kiyone. I&#39;m not hungry any more.&quot; She turned and walked away. 

Kiyone glanced back at Milloi uncertainly, but once again followed 
after the blond. Behind her she heard him call out, &quot;Perhaps I was 
wrong about who the man is.&quot; 

Tenchi sat looking out at the sea of stars spread out before him. The 
inside of the ship was designed to look like his house, but he knew 
that the outside was radically different. Still it was comfortable. 

&quot;It&#39;s really beautiful out here.&quot; He said. 

Ryoko was sitting next to him, her head leaning against his shoulder. 
&quot;Yeah, I know. When I had just finished robbing a bank or something 
sometimes I would just sit and stare. It always made me feel... 
peaceful.&quot; 

&quot;I remember.&quot; Tenchi said. 

&quot;Oh that&#39;s right.&quot; She kissed his neck. &quot;The dimension tuner. But you 
didn&#39;t like that.&quot; 

Tenchi smiled and hugged her tightly. &quot;There were some moments.&quot; He 
ran a hand through her thick hair. 

Ryoko smiled and rubbed his thigh. &quot;Yeah, well I can think of some 
better ones.&quot; 

&quot;Ryoko we only just started out. I mean we haven&#39;t even gotten to the 
resort Aeka reserved for us.&quot; He said with a grin. 

&quot;Oh but Tenchi, there&#39;ll be plenty of time there too. All night, all 
day, and maybe during lunch.&quot; She whispered into his ear and his 
response was cut off when she sucked on his ear lobe. &quot;You&#39;re young 
and strong. You can take it.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; He said playfully. He felt himself suddenly pushed 
onto his back. &quot;Oof!&quot; 

&quot;Mmm, now that&#39;s more like it. Speechless at my beauty.&quot; 

The air had been knocked out of him, but Tenchi knew better than to 
say so. Ryoko bent above him, her breasts hanging in his face. Long 
suppressed hormones kicked in and he just nodded, unable to look away. 

&quot;Such a naughty boy you are Tenchi.&quot; Ryoko said, tracing her finger 
over his chest. &quot;Staring at a girl like that. What kind of woman do 
you take me for?&quot; 

Tenchi reached up and rubbed his hand against her cheek. Ryoko took it 
and held it close, her eyes closing. &quot;My girl.&quot; 

&quot;Forever and ever.&quot; She said. Then she pushed his hand down and 
grinned. &quot;But you&#39;re mine too Tenchi.&quot; She slipped her legs over his 
and sat up on his lap. 

While Tenchi watched her clothes disappeared. Her breasts, as always, 
seemed to defy gravity while jiggling nicely. Absently he reached up 
and ran the tips of his fingers over the large pink nipples. They 
hardened insistently and she began to grind against him. 

&quot;Tenchi...&quot; She whispered. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be needing those 
clothes for this trip.&quot; She grabbed his shirt in both hands and 
pulled. There was a loud tearing sound and Tenchi lowered his hands 
long enough to slip them out of his sleeves. 

&quot;Whatever you say Ryoko.&quot; He said. &quot;I love you.&quot; 

&quot;I know you do Tenchi. I love you too. I love you and I make love too 
you...&quot; She moved her hips forward, slipping her pussy against his 
belly and chest. She moved upwards slowly and stopped literally 
floating over Tenchi&#39;s face. &quot;Taste it Tenchi. Please.&quot; 

He didn&#39;t need any more encouragement. Bending forward he pressed his 
hands against her thighs and flicked his tongue out across her clit. 
It always amazed him that she tasted so good. His lips tugged at hers 
and he got so focused that he barely noticed her leaning back and 
working his pants down his legs. Not exactly surprised by Ryoko&#39;s 
behavior, he wasn&#39;t wearing underwear. 

Ryoko got his shoes and pants off just as she came. &quot;Ah!&quot; Tenchi&#39;s 
tongue was in her and her juices slipped into his mouth. &quot;Oh... I... I 
need you in me Tenchi.&quot; She pulled back and floated away from him. 

&quot;I need you too Ryoko.&quot; He whispered, licking off his lips. He stared 
at her and grinned. &quot;I can never believe you&#39;re mine.&quot; 

Ryoko rotated midair and laughed. &quot;Believe it... now get over here.&quot; 
She landed on the floor and spread herself over the arm of the couch, 
her ass pointed into the air. &quot;Give yourself to me.&quot; 

He didn&#39;t need any more encouragement. Standing up he walked up behind 
her and ran his hands over her butt. &quot;Where...&quot; 

&quot;Just do it Tenchi!&quot; She cried. 

Tenchi pushed forward with his hips and slid the tip of his dick into 
her pussy. Ryoko pushed back and they both gasped as the tip of her 
wet clit ran across it. He was all the way inside her with barely any 
effort and they both stood there for a moment just enjoying it. Then 
Ryoko began rubbing her own breasts and moaned. Tenchi responded and 
pushed forward, pressing her into the couch. 

Finally he moved out and almost left her before moving the other way. 
In and out... he wasn&#39;t sure how long he did it and he didn&#39;t care, 
but eventually Ryoko&#39;s breath caught and she tightened around him. It 
was too much and he came at the same time. 

&quot;Oh yes...&quot; Ryoko hissed. &quot;You&#39;re always so quiet Tenchi.&quot; 

&quot;I know.&quot; He said. &quot;I just can&#39;t...&quot; 

&quot;Shh! It&#39;s okay.&quot; She jerked her hips. &quot;What I really like is how you 
always manage to stay ready. You&#39;re still so hard.&quot; 

Tenchi gritted his teeth as she rolled onto her back, still lying 
across the couch. Her hands squeezed her breasts while she stared at 
Tenchi&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;We don&#39;t want to let it go to waste do we?&quot; 

Tenchi shook his head and slowly ran his hands up her legs and began 
rubbing her belly. &quot;No.&quot; 

&quot;Tenchi.&quot; She whispered. &quot;You know what that does to me.&quot; More juices 
began leaking out of her and Ryoko moaned. &quot;But two can play that 
game. Watch carefully lover.&quot; Lifting up her left breast Ryoko bent 
her neck down and managed to suck her nipple into her own mouth. 
Making exaggerated moans and muffled yells she chewed and sucked at 
herself and rubbed her pussy against Tenchi&#39;s dick faster. 

He was surprised when he got even harder than he had been. The 
comforting wet feeling coming from Ryoko seemed to hold and caress 
him. His jaw dropped open automatically and his eyes closed. 

Tenchi was really surprised when Ryoko suddenly vanished. His eyes 
opened just before she pushed him back again and wrapped her fingers 
around his dick. Her other hand cupped his balls. &quot;You tasted me 
Tenchi. I want to do the same to you.&quot; 

&quot;Ryoko I&#39;m about to...&quot; He was cut off as she pinched the base of his 
dick. &quot;Oh.&quot; 

Ryoko smiled and leaned forward, wrapping her lips around the head. 
The tip of her tongue began licking at the hole and her hand started 
pumping him. Tenchi shoved his hands into her hair again. Finally his 
muscles twitched and Ryoko&#39;s hands released him. He came into her 
mouth with a gasp and she greedily swallowed it. When she was done, 
she slowly pulled back, a line of cum connecting her tongue to him. 

&quot;Mine.&quot; She hissed. 

Tenchi, his head swimming slightly, could only nod as Ryoko began 
working her way back up his body. 

As Yagami moved away from GPHQ, Kiyone glanced sideways at Mihoshi. 
The blond was staring straight ahead and had an unfamiliar set to her 
jaw. Neither of them seemed to be able to think of anything to say. 

Finally Kiyone mumbled something and Mihoshi looked over at her. 
&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;I said he&#39;s an ass.&quot; Kiyone said. 

Mihoshi&#39;s jaw hung slack for a moment and then she bit down on her 
lip. Seconds later a loud snort came out of her nose and she began to 
laugh uncontrollably. Kiyone smiled and joined in. Then she realized 
that Mihoshi had tears falling down her cheeks and stopped. 

&quot;Mihoshi...&quot; She reached over, but Mihoshi turned away and sobbed. 

&quot;Kiyone... Kiyone please don&#39;t look at me.&quot; She said. Kiyone wasn&#39;t 
sure what to do. Mihoshi&#39;s shoulders heaved and she kept her head 
down. &quot;I know it hurts you to see me cry. It&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll be 
fine in a minute.&quot; 

Kiyone stared at her for a minute. Then she felt the anger boiling up 
inside of her chest. &quot;You idiot!&quot; 

Mihoshi turned automatically, too surprised to stop herself. &quot;But 
Kiyone I...&quot; 

&quot;None of your excuses!&quot; Kiyone yelled. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you can be 
this clueless! I mean honestly you have done some dumb things in your 
time, but this takes the cake. And stop crying.&quot; 

Mihoshi stared at her, &quot;Kiyone all I did was... I mean he...&quot; 

&quot;He&#39;s a moron and you sure as hell don&#39;t owe him anything. If you 
don&#39;t stop whining about it I&#39;m cutting off your cookie supply for the 
next month! Not that we&#39;ll be able to afford any on our budget and 
with the jobs we get.&quot; 

Mihoshi suddenly realized that her tears had stopped. In the face of 
Kiyone&#39;s anger she&#39;d slipped back into her normal routine and simply 
responded like she always did. She was completely in shock when she 
realized this and couldn&#39;t respond. 

Kiyone sniffed and turned away. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I had to yell at you like 
that, but you were acting stupid again. Unless you actually want to go 
back to that loser.&quot; She still sounded angry but Mihoshi heard the 
note of doubt in her voice. 

&quot;No Kiyone! I&#39;m sorry. I just... he hurt me a lot and that wasn&#39;t 
exactly...&quot; She stopped and a smile spread across her face. &quot;Thanks 
for setting me straight Kiyone. I needed that.&quot; 

Kiyone reached over and stroked Mihoshi&#39;s face. &quot;Any time Mihoshi.&quot; 
She gently kissed the blond on the cheek and smiled. &quot;You still want 
me to call you Mimuri?&quot; 

She shook her head emphatically. &quot;No... that&#39;s not who I am any more. 
I guess I&#39;ve been Mihoshi for too long.&quot; She paused and pulled Kiyone 
to her, hugging tightly. &quot;But I&#39;ll tell you all about her on the way 
home. I promised.&quot; 

Kiyone nuzzled into Mihoshi&#39;s hair and hugged back just as tightly. 

For three days Washu and Aeka had enjoyed spending time alone in the 
house. They&#39;d had sex on just about every surface, stayed up watching 
movies, and even gone swimming out in the lake. Washu was enjoying it 
mostly because she rarely got out of the lab and Aeka felt like she 
was on a trip like Ryoko and Tenchi. 

They were both mildly disappointed when Washu&#39;s sensors informed them 
that Kiyone and Mihoshi were on their way back. &quot;They&#39;ll arrive by 
sunset.&quot; Washu said. 

&quot;Well then I guess it&#39;s back to sneaking around.&quot; Aeka said casually, 
turning it into a good thing. She put her arms around Washu and smiled 
down at her. &quot;We&#39;ll have to spend all our time hiding all the nasty 
things we do together and who knows, we might get caught.&quot; 

Washu chuckled and dug her fingers into Aeka&#39;s butt. &quot;Mmm, you know 
you&#39;re the best pupil I ever had.&quot; 

&quot;Not counting your eyes.&quot; Aeka said staring at her. In her mind she 
was always amazed at the floating sensation she got when she was 
around Washu. Washu was in charge, Washu knew what to do, and Washu 
always knew what she needed. &quot;But you know... I&#39;d like to try 
something special tonight.&quot; 

Washu raised an eyebrow. &quot;I have a trained squid.&quot; 

&quot;No! I mean no, something else tonight.&quot; Aeka said after a minute. 
&quot;We&#39;ll save that for later.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, so what&#39;s your idea?&quot; Washu asked. Aeka tugged gently on 
Washu&#39;s hair and told her. Washu grinned and lifted Aeka up into the 
air. &quot;Now that sounds fun... but it is rather public. Are you sure you 
wouldn&#39;t rather try something a bit more private.&quot; 

Aeka stuck up her nose and smirked. &quot;I&#39;ve been doing some research, 
because something struck me as odd. It seems a great many of the Jurai 
family have had relationships like this.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; Washu said. &quot;I told you I checked into your past.&quot; She 
set Aeka down and lightly slapped her on the ass. &quot;You royals love 
being told what to do under the right condition. And it&#39;s not like you 
don&#39;t have the technology for two women to produce an heir.&quot; 

&quot;Well...&quot; Aeka said, managing to suppress her blush. &quot;My point is that 
I&#39;d better get used to it... unless you have a better offer?&quot; 

&quot;Better than the future queen of the galaxy?&quot; Washu asked. &quot;Especially 
one who can use her toes to...&quot; Aeka cut her off again. 

&quot;Anyway do you like my idea or not?&quot; Aeka said severely. Washu had 
control in most things, but on occasion Aeka felt she had the right to 
invoke her royal perogatives. &quot;You don&#39;t have to.&quot; 

&quot;No, I like it.&quot; Washu said quickly. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll even come up with 
something else.&quot; She let her eyes slide over Aeka&#39;s body. &quot;I&#39;ll just 
bet I can embarrass you so much in front of all those people. A few 
hundred eyes staring at you, judging everything you&#39;re doing, and...&quot; 
Aeka slapped a hand over her mouth, already breaking into a cold 
sweat. &quot;Sh! Don&#39;t ruin it... a few more words and we&#39;ll have to clean 
the floor again Little Washu.&quot; 

Washu licked Aeka&#39;s hand and the princess pulled it away. &quot;Fine... see 
you in three hours?&quot; 

Aeka nodded. &quot;Yes. We&#39;ll get ready and you can just teleport us to 
where we&#39;re going.&quot; They kissed on it and Aeka headed for the stairs 
while Washu went to her lab. 

Once she was in her room Aeka went to her closet and began looking 
around. She&#39;d considered keeping some of the outfits Washu had her 
wear in there, but had decided that Sasami finding them would not be 
something either of them could handle if for no other reason that it 
would ruin Aeka&#39;s idea of her sister being an innocent little girl. 
Still she did have the leash and choke chain hanging on a hook inside 
the door. 

She ignored it though and began looking through the large collection 
of clothes she&#39;d bought, sending the designed back to Jurai and having 
them made there. After all, she couldn&#39;t have Tenchi paying for such 
things. Especially since most of them had been bought to be worn 
specifically for him. 

Aeka laughed and asked her reflection, &quot;Was that really me? Fawning 
over a boy like that.&quot; In her mind she realized that Tenchi would have 
never been able to make her truly happy as a lover. As a friend he was 
perfect... but Ryoko could have what was beneath his waste. He was far 
to gentle for Aeka. 

Something caught Aeka&#39;s eye and she picked up the hanger it was 
attached to. It was perfect, a tight black dress with various shards 
spun into the thread. She&#39;d never worn it, but just holding it she 
could see each piece of valuable gem catch the light in rainbow 
flashes. Diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, rubies... they were all there 
and each one was shaped to send the light directly into a person&#39;s 
eyes. 

Setting it gently on her futon she stripped off her robes and quickly 
ducked into the hall and the bathroom. The pool shimmered and rippled 
when she slipped into it and reached for the shampoo dispenser. 
Sometimes it was nice to use a shower, but right now she just wanted 
to get clean. 

Scrubbing at her head, she closed her eyes and let the suds drip down 
over her body. Finally she ducked under and washed it off, digging her 
fingers in deep. When she needed air she surfaced and threw her hair 
over her back. The water washed down her body and splashed into the 
pool. 

Next she grabbed a washcloth and the soap.

When she got it lathered up she set the bar aside and began working 
the cloth over her arms, down her chest, and along her legs. (Look, a 
lemon author who can use a thesaurus and dictionary!). She rubbed 
hard, making sure to get all the dirt and dead skin, until her body 
was a uniform pink color that matched her nipples. She cleaned every 
crevice, resisting the urge to play with herself. 

Aeka finally finished and got out, she dried off and wrapped a towel 
around her hair and another around her body. Going back to her room 
she shut the door behind her without thinking and took off the towels. 
Aeka sat in front of the vanity mirror on her dresser and reached for 
a comb. It took ten minutes for her to comb her hair back into a pony 
tale. She tied it with a black bow. 

Then she reached for her makeup. She almost never wore it, except to 
official functions and for her own amusement. Most of the time Aeka 
merely stuck to her own natural beauty and grace. 

She laid it all out of the table and went to put on her dress. It was 
a tight fit and hugged every curve of her body. She never wore a bra, 
but in this dress she didn&#39;t need to. It lifted everything on its own. 
When she got it on she returned to the mirror and began applying 
makeup. She started with dark blue eyeliner and a bit of blush. Last, 
but not least, she took out some green lipstick, carefully applied it 
to her mouth, and put matching polish on her nails. 

When the polish had dried she went back to her closet and took out a 
pair of dark nylon stockings, slipping them over her legs and finished 
the whole outfit off with black high-heeled pumps and a white purse. 
Her eyes caught the clock and she saw that it was 7:00. 

Going back down stairs she took the steps carefully, not wanting to 
slip and ruin the mood. Still she did pause when she saw Washu waiting 
for her. The scientist smiled up and said, &quot;You look great.&quot; 

Washu was in a tuxedo. There were several alterations from the usual 
kind though. For one it was a lot tighter, hugging Washu&#39;s calves and 
chest and not leaving anything to the imagination. The white shirt 
under the jacket was stretched tight over her chest, the buttons 
straining. Aeka saw a hint of purple through the fabric, indicating 
that Washu was wearing a bra. To add to the look she was also wearing 
a black bow tie around her neck. It didn&#39;t slip through the collar of 
her shirt; it was just tightly wrapped around her throat. 

Aeka noticed that the shoes were the standard though. Shiny and black, 
they didn&#39;t have any extra heel. When compared to Aeka&#39;s it made the 
scientist look even shorter than normal. Still the look of confidense 
on her face more than made up to it because, short as she was, Washu&#39;s 
presence could fill up a whole room. She was also wearing blood red 
lipstick. 

&quot;Washu, you&#39;re a hunk.&quot; Aeka said and came the rest of the way down 
the stairs. Washu changed her stance and Aeka noticed a large bulge at 
the front of her pants. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; 

Washu glanced down and then winked at her. &quot;It&#39;s for later. After all, 
I&#39;ve decided to be the man tonight.&quot; 

Aeka suddenly had a vision of something Washu had done before. She&#39;d 
been shocked when it had happened, even though they&#39;d both enjoyed it. 
Washu had altered herself for an hour or so. She&#39;d used one of her 
machines to give herself male genitalia, in addition to her own. She 
and Aeka had both played with it, abused it, and it had been fun, but 
afterwards when they were cuddling, they&#39;d both agreed that the whole 
thing had been too weird. 

&quot;Did you...&quot; Aeka started to ask, but Washu held up a finger. Aeka 
understood. Whatever it was, she&#39;d have to wait and see. &quot;Um, could 
you zip up my back?&quot; She turned revealing the zipper behind her. Washu 
reached over and slowly pulled it up the princess&#39;s spine. 

Just then Mihoshi and Kiyone walked through the door. They paused and 
looked at the two of them. 

&quot;Well you look spiffy.&quot; Kiyone said. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mihoshi put in. &quot;You two going out?&quot; 

Washu glanced at Aeka who surprised all of them by walking over to her 
and slipping an arm around the red head&#39;s waist. &quot;Yes, we have 
reservations at a restaraunt.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Kiyone and I were going to the Karaoke bar tonight.&quot; Mihoshi 
said. 

Kiyone smiled and asked, &quot;Washu... do you mind if we barrow your video 
recorder again?&quot; 

Washu grinned and said, &quot;Certainly. Is it just for the singing or were 
you planning something for later?&quot; 

Kiyone smirked and said, &quot;Let&#39;s just say you don&#39;t get a copy.&quot; 

&quot;Like she needs it.&quot; Aeka muttered and got an elbow in the ribs. 

&quot;Sure, here.&quot; She waved a hand and a hole opened in the air. A red 
yardstick fell onto the floor. All four of them stared for a second, 
and then Washu scooped it up and slid it back into the hole, pulling 
out the recorder. &quot;Uh... here. Well we must be off. Have fun.&quot; She 
shoved it into Mihoshi&#39;s hand and then she and Aeka vanished. 

Mihoshi was still blushing furiously when she felt Kiyone tug on her 
arm. &quot;Huh?&quot; 

&quot;Come on Mihoshiiiii!&quot; Kiyone said in her best Mihoshi impression. &quot;I 
want to go sing!&quot; 

Mihoshi laughed and poked her in the rub right behind her breast. 
&quot;You&#39;re going to pay for that.&quot; Kiyone just laughed and dragged her 
out the door. 

Aeka had her arm linked with Washu&#39;s as they appeared outside of a 
French restaurant on Main Street in Okinawa. There was a line with 
three other couples ahead of them. A cool breeze blew through the 
night air while they stood patiently waiting their turn. 

&quot;Oops, I almost forgot.&quot; Washu said. She reached into her picked and 
pulled out a black box. She handed it to Aeka. &quot;Here, I considered a 
corsage... but this seemed more appropriate.&quot; 

Aeka opened the box and gasped. Inside was a silver necklace, polished 
so that it caught the light like her dress did. On the end was an 
amulet shaped like a rose. &quot;It&#39;s beautiful.&quot; 

&quot;I thought you&#39;d like it.&quot; Washu said. Reaching down she slipped it 
out of the box and unhinged the clasp. Aeka bent down and let it be 
put around her neck, then Washu picked up the case and put it back in 
her pocket, not taking her eyes off of the spot between Aeka&#39;s breasts 
where it hung. 

&quot;Ahem,&quot; Someone cleared their throat and they both looked up. The 
concierge was looking at them expectantly. &quot;Your reservations?&quot; 

&quot;They&#39;re under Princess Aeka Jurai and Professor Washu.&quot; Aeka said, 
pointedly ignoring the odd looks the man was giving them and some of 
the low whispers some of the people in line behind them had begun. 

&quot;Table for four?&quot; The man asked. 

&quot;No, just two.&quot; Washu said in perfect French and grinned at him. &quot;Is 
there a problem with that?&quot; 

Swallowing the man said, &quot;No madam, I was merely surprised. I&#39;m sure 
you understand.&quot; He bowed to both of them. &quot;We rarely entertain 
royalty... aliens yes, because after all this is Japan. Please, follow 
me.&quot; 

They were led into a room with walls and carpet of matching red felt. 
A booth in the back was prepared with two crystal glasses with water 
in them and some folded napkins with a set of real silver eating 
utensils on each one. There was a big red dripping candle right in the 
middle and violin music filled the air. 

Sliding in, they were handed menus and the man said, &quot;The waiter will 
be along shortly.&quot; 

Aeka looked around the room and saw several heads quickly turn away. 
She felt conspicuous and exposed. &quot;Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good 
idea.&quot; 

Washu reached over and took her hand. &quot;Aeka, if you want to leave 
that&#39;s fine.&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; Aeka said firmly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just so new.&quot; 

&quot;I know.&quot; Washu leaned forward and planted a firm kiss on her lips. 
Then she sat back down just as the waiter showed up. 

Aeka was surprised when he didn&#39;t even give them a strange look. &quot;Can 
I take your orders?&quot; 

&quot;Oh...&quot; Aeka realized she hadn&#39;t even looked at the menu. &quot;Uh...&quot; 

Washu quickly took charge. &quot;We&#39;ll have the house special, no escargot, 
and a bottle of your best wine.&quot; She grinned at Aeka. &quot;I&#39;m paying 
after all.&quot; 

Aeka gasped and the waiter walked away. &quot;Oh my gosh. I forgot all 
about money!&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Washu said. &quot;I&#39;ve got plenty.&quot; 

&quot;Well, he was certainly polite. Do you think the man we met when we 
entered warned him?&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; Washu said. &quot;However I do know him from someplace. He was in the 
store where I picked up some of our toys. Same isle.&quot; 

Aeka didn&#39;t know what to say. So she simply sat there, still holding 
Washu&#39;s hand until the food arrived. After that the conversation 
turned to soap operas, the local news, and what Aeka had last heard 
from Jurai or the latest scientific discoveries. They didn&#39;t even 
notice when they empties half the bottle of wine the waiter had 
brought. 

Aeka gasped when Washu&#39;s glass tipped back and spilled a bit of wine 
down the front of her shirt. &quot;Oh no! Washu, your shirt...&quot; 

&quot;Ah, it&#39;s okay.&quot; Washu said. &quot;Come on, we&#39;ll go to the bathroom and 
clean it off. But let&#39;s hurry before the stain sets.&quot; 

They both slid out of the booth and walked over to the small hallway 
by the door that led into the bathroom. It wasn&#39;t a very large one, 
only onto toilet and sink. Aeka locked the door while Washu stripped 
off her jacket and started to unbutton her shirt. &quot;Damn it.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Aeka asked. 

&quot;These last two buttons are too tight. Could you help me?&quot; She 
indicated the two between her breasts that were holding the shirt 
closed. &quot;I&#39;ll push my breasts together and you undo them.&quot; 

Aeka&#39;s head was spinning slightly from the wine, so she missed the 
smile on Washu&#39;s face. Instead she simply nodded and reached for the 
buttons while Washu pushed her breasts together. She did however feel 
a slight jolt when her hands brushed Washu&#39;s breasts and the shirt 
popped open. Washu let herself go and Aeka was surprised to see her 
chest fully spill out. Looking closer she saw that Washu&#39;s bra was 
rigged to unhook in the front. 

Washu plans for everything, she thought. &quot;I&#39;ve been set up.&quot; 

&quot;Maybe...&quot; Washu said and leaned forward. &quot;Okay, definitely.&quot; She 
pulled up the sides of her shirt showing that the stain was gone. &quot;Do 
you mind?&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; Aeka whispered. Absently she reached out and cupped Washu&#39;s 
breasts in her hands, rubbing her palms into the nipples. 

Washu moaned and slid her hand down Aeka&#39;s back. There was a small 
vibration along the princess&#39;s spine when Washu slid the zipper open. 
&quot;Are you sure? You were so set on a romantic evening.&quot; 

&quot;This is romantic.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;You bought me dinner, we both dressed 
up, and now we&#39;re going to make love. The fact that it&#39;s in public 
only helps.&quot; 

Washu smiled and tugged the dress down Aeka&#39;s waist and let it drop to 
the floor. Moving forward she pressed her breasts against Aeka&#39;s and 
kissed her roughly. In the mirror Aeka saw their lips press together 
in a mix of red and green. Washu released her after a time and gently 
helped her sit back on the toilet with the lid down. Aeka felt the 
cold porcelain touch her skin and moaned, spreading her legs open. 

Kneeling down Washu rubbed her cheek into Aeka&#39;s thigh and quickly 
moved up to her vagina, pocking her lips around the clit peeking 
through the folds. Moving her hand up she slid one finger in, letting 
the building juices slide out of her. Washu lapped them up eagerly, 
adding finger after finger. 

Aeka dug her nails into Washu&#39;s scalp for balance as she felt teeth 
working over her clit and each finger enter her, when without warning 
Washu shoved her whole fist into her. She screamed and clenched around 
the limb when Washu started pushing in and out hard and rotating her 
wrist. Aeka came for what must have been the third time just as there 
was a knock at the door. 

&quot;Are you ladies alright in there?&quot; It was the voice of their waiter. 

&quot;Fine.&quot; Aeka gasped out when Washu quickly pulled her fist out with a 
wet pop. 

&quot;She just slipped on some of the water. We&#39;ll be out soon.&quot; 

&quot;Certainly.&quot; He said and they heard him walk away. 

Washu grinned while Aeka saw there breathing hard, her fingers still 
in Washu&#39;s hair. &quot;You enjoy that?&quot; 

&quot;Very much Little Washu.&quot; Aeka breathed. &quot;How can I thank you?&quot; 

Washu grinned and stood up. &quot;How about a blow job?&quot; 

Out of her mind with pleasure Aeka just nodded. &quot;Anything you want 
Washu.&quot; 

Washu slowly unzipped the front of her pants and let them drop around 
her legs. Aeka was surprised once again when instead of actual 
genitals was the orange dildo Washu had used on her their first time 
together. One end was jammed deeply into Washu&#39;s pussy while the other 
pointed up at Aeka. 

Without thinking about it Aeka slid off the toilet onto her knees and 
gripped the piece of orange rubber with both hands. Washu&#39;s legs 
bucked and Aeka let go with one hand for a moment to help lower her to 
her back on the tile floor. &quot;This was in you all night?&quot; 

Washu nodded, her eyes closed. &quot;Yes. I thought you deserved a little 
effort.&quot; A drop of liquid squirted out of Washu and onto the floor. 
&quot;Gods, it&#39;s been torture.&quot; 

&quot;Then let me help.&quot; Aeka said. Bending over she wrapped her lips 
around the end of the dildo, licking at it, biting it, and bobbing her 
head faster and harder driving the other end into the walls of Washu&#39;s 
pussy. Aeka let it slide all the way down her throat and felt her lips 
brush Washu&#39;s clit before she had to breath and pull back. Washu 
moaned and writhed on the tiles while Aeka made little sounds too. 

Washu came hard, gritting her teeth so she wouldn&#39;t make noise. Then 
she lay there, basking in the warm afterglow. She only opened her eyes 
when she unexpectedly felt the dildo get jerked out of her and cool 
air blow into the hole before it closed up. &quot;Aeka what are you...&quot; She 
trailed off when she saw what the princess was doing. 

On her knees, legs spread, Aeka was pushing the cum covered end of the 
dildo into her asshole. Washu watched as she buried it hard and fast 
and then tuned her attention back to the smaller woman. Not making a 
sound Aeka held the thing in her left hand and used two fingers of her 
right hand to spread open Washu&#39;s ass. Washu responded by lifting 
herself off the tile to meet the thrust as Aeka pushed into her 
without stopping. It went all the way in until each felt the other&#39;s 
pussy rubbing into her own. Neither knew who started it but seconds 
later they were banging their hips together harder and harder, leaving 
what were sure to become large bruises. Green and red lipstick traded 
turns sucking on nipples and both of them rolled over, dripping cum 
down each other&#39;s legs. 

A little while later Aeka and Washu were dressed again, their lipstick 
nowhere to be seen and, walking arm in arm back to their booth where 
Washu laid down enough money for their meal and a sixty percent tip. 
Then the turned and walked towards the door. 

&quot;I hope you ladies enjoyed your meal.&quot; The host said when they passed 
him. 

&quot;Everything was delicious.&quot; Aeka said. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Added Washu. &quot;We may definitely eat here again. Now if you&#39;ll 
excuse us, we&#39;re going for a long walk to clear our heads. Your wine 
was a bit too good.&quot; 

&quot;Very good madam.&quot; The man said and they exited the building. They 
were both very impressed when he didn&#39;t mention the large lump at the 
front of Aeka&#39;s dress. 

Mihoshi lay on the couch next to Kiyone as they fast-forwarded through 
the video they had just made. Both of them felt this was a good time 
to watch it, because they were too tired to get turned on anymore 
tonight. 

&quot;You ready?&quot; Kiyone asked. They&#39;d already listened to themselves sing 
at the club. It brought back pleasant memories of the day they&#39;d come 
together as more than friends. 

&quot;As I&#39;ll ever be.&quot; They were both wearing large nightshirts and 
Mihoshi was holding a large bowl of popcorn. &quot;We&#39;d better hurry before 
Washu and Aeka get home though.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, here it is.&quot; She pushed play and they began watching. 

Mihoshi lay naked on the bed while Kiyone set up the camera on the 
nightstand three feet across the room from them, and hit record. She 
moved back and on the screen was a clear shot of her very wet pussy. 

&quot;Why are you doing this Kiyone?&quot; Mihoshi asked. &quot;We already recorded 
our singing tonight. What could be more of a turn on than that?&quot; 

&quot;Because I think it&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Kiyone said. 

&quot;Oh, well okay then.&quot; Mihoshi said brightly. &quot;So what are we going to 
do?&quot; 

&quot;Well this is for us right?&quot; Kiyone walked away from the camera and 
over to the bed. It was large, being made of their two other beds now 
pushed together. &quot;So why don&#39;t we make it for us? You know, pretend we 
know we&#39;re watching.&quot; 

&quot;Yes!&quot; Mihoshi turned to the camera and waved. &quot;Hi Kiyone. Hi me!&quot; 

Kiyone laughed and did the same. &quot;Hey Kiyone. Bet you never thought 
you&#39;d be doing this huh? And with Mihoshi too!&quot; She sat back against 
the wall and motioned for Mihoshi to do the same next to her. &quot;First, 
we&#39;re going to show you what you&#39;ve got, and then we&#39;re going to 
remind you what you do with it?&quot; 

&quot;We are?&quot; Mihoshi asked in awe. &quot;How are we going to do that?&quot; She was 
smirking and winked at the camera so Kiyone would know she was playing 
along. 

Kiyone didn&#39;t hesitate to reach over and push Mihoshi&#39;s legs apart. 
Then she took her hands and spread Mihoshi&#39;s pussy open so that the 
camera had a clear view. She even pushed Mihoshi&#39;s clit upwards with 
her thumbs. The blond moaned and her legs shifted as Kiyone&#39;s pinky 
fingers played with her pubic hair. 

&quot;Look at that.&quot; She said deep in her throat. &quot;Look how wet and open 
she is. Don&#39;t you just want to fill that thing up with your fingers 
and lick it all over?&quot; 

Mihoshi suddenly closed her legs and Kiyone pulled back. Then Mihoshi 
pushed her softly back into the wall and opened Kiyone&#39;s legs. &quot;Ah, 
but look at this one.&quot; She trailed her fingers down over Kiyone&#39;s 
pussy, making her squirm, but kept moving down. &quot;She&#39;s so delicious... 
but that&#39;s not half as fun as the color her face turns when you play 
with this!&quot; Kiyone gasped and felt her face burn when Mihoshi shoved 
her index and middle fingers into her ass and spread it open. &quot;See? 
Her face is turning this same color and the best part is she likes 
it!&quot; 

Sucking in a deep breath of air Kiyone reached over and took Mihoshi&#39;s 
entire left breast between her hands, large sections of flesh spilling 
between her fingers. &quot;Oh yeah? Well what about these things? They&#39;re 
so big and soft. Gods, I could just sit here and play with these 
things all day.&quot; She pressed her lips to a space between her fingers 
and gently sucked on the flesh there. 

Mihoshi groaned and pulled her hands away from between Kiyone&#39;s legs, 
getting a whimper from her green haired partner. Then she struck, 
grabbing one of Kiyone&#39;s breasts in each hand. 

&quot;Hmm, but look at this. Kiyone is so firm and her nipples are so much 
bigger than the tiny pink ones I have.&quot; Squeezing and releasing with 
her right hand she took Kiyone&#39;s right nipple between three of the 
fingers of her left hand and began gently twisting. &quot;And you know what 
happens when you do this to her species.&quot; A drop of thick clear fluid 
dripped from the tip of Kiyone&#39;s nipple. Kiyone unconsciously bit down 
on Mihoshi&#39;s soft skin as the blond used a finger to scoop it up and 
bring it to her lips, leaving a thin line still attached to the large 
nipple. She licked it up and squealed. &quot;Oh I love how she tastes and 
listen to those sounds she&#39;s making!&quot; 

Kiyone pulled back and they wrapped their arms around each other. 
&quot;Mmm, I almost forgot your mouth.&quot; She kissed Mihoshi&#39;s bottom lip and 
took it between her teeth, tugging softly then releasing it to shoot 
back. 

&quot;Your tongue.&quot; Mihoshi said and flicked out her own pink tongue. 
Kiyone responded, her own tongue redder than Mihoshi&#39;s, and they let 
their tongues dance outside their mouths licking at each other and 
swapping saliva. 

&quot;Do you think we&#39;re turned on yet?&quot; Kiyone said looking at the camera. 

Mihoshi shook her head and kissed Kiyone&#39;s neck and collarbone. &quot;No. 
They&#39;re just sitting there on the couch staring at us.&quot; 

&quot;So what should we do?&quot; Kiyone said, arching her back. 

&quot;Mmm, we&#39;ll have to just keep going. I&#39;ll fuck you and you fuck me 
Kiyone until we cum again and again and again.&quot; 

Kiyone moved her hand back to Mihoshi&#39;s crotch and slipped three 
fingers into her, moving them in hard and fast. &quot;Oh yes Mihoshi. You 
have such good ideas.&quot; 

Mihoshi moaned and screamed, then reached for Kiyone too. Making a 
pinching moment she slipped her index finger into Kiyone&#39;s ass and 
pushed her thumb into the wet and waiting pussy, rubbing the knuckle 
into her clit. &quot;Is this what you want Kiyone?&quot; 

&quot;Yes! Yes Mihoshi I want you in my ass and my pussy. It feels so 
good!&quot; The camera could easily see both girls flexing the muscles 
below their waists, tugging at each other&#39;s fingers. 

&quot;Kiyone you&#39;re so tight.&quot; Mihoshi moaned. &quot;Just like a virgin.&quot; 

&quot;And you&#39;re so loose. I love how I can just slide right in...&quot; Kiyone 
added her fourth finger and pulled up. &quot;You&#39;re always so ready.&quot; 

Mihoshi didn&#39;t respond. Instead she moved her upper body forward and 
sucked Kiyone&#39;s farthest breast into her mouth, sucking hard. Both of 
them came twice at that moment, but neither was willing to stop. 
Mihoshi sucked and moaned at Kiyone&#39;s chest as Kiyone used her free 
hand to keep them both sitting up. 

Kiyone felt something soft bump her chin and saw Mihoshi pushing one 
of her huge breasts up to within reach of Kiyone&#39;s mouth. Not wasting 
any time she attacked it eagerly, clamping her teeth around the hard 
pink nipple. Mihoshi let go and Kiyone&#39;s teeth were supporting the 
entire weight of it while inside her mouth she sucked and licked at 
it, tugging hard to keep from dropping it. 

The video went on for several more hours. Moans and groans issued from 
the television for the entire time, never ceasing or even seeming to 
tire until the video ran out and the VCR automatically rewound it. 
Mihoshi and Kiyone didn&#39;t see any of it. 

The next morning they woke up on top of each other in a sixty-nine 
position. Dried cum covered them and even then they went on for a few 
minutes before getting up to take a shower. 

Aeka lay sleeping on the bed Washu had teleported them too after their 
walk. Her arms and legs were still tied to the posts and she was 
completely naked, but had a very contented look on her face. 

Next to her Washu crouched on the floor staring at her face and 
wearing a suit made of tight black leather. A riding crop was on the 
floor next to her legs, completely forgotten. Removing her right glove 
Washu reached out and gently traced her fingers over the bruises and 
small cuts covering Aeka&#39;s body. The princess stirred slightly and 
Washu smiled down with nothing but love in her eyes as she spoke in 
her sleep. 

&quot;Please hit me again Little Washu...&quot; And then sank back into a sound 
sleep. 

A the resort Ryoko lay in her bikini on a tropical beach next to 
Tenchi, who was guzzling some of the energy drink Washu had left on 
the ship and looking severely dehydrated, but also content. She turned 
and kissed him on the cheek, then reached into his shorts and wrapped 
her fingers around his overused penis once again and began pumping. 
When Tenchi came he lay there for a while as she licked her hand clean 
and got back to her sunbathing. 

Meanwhile, at a theme park in Shinjuko, for the fourth day in a row 
Sasami, Ryo-ohki, and Noboyuki stood in line for the theme park to 
open. 

&quot;You know,&quot; Noboyuki said. &quot;I think standing in all these lines all 
day has got to be the most tiring thing a person can do.&quot; 

&quot;I agree.&quot; Yosho said. 

&quot;No kidding. Tomorrow let&#39;s just hang out at the hotel pool.&quot; 

&quot;Meow.&quot; Ryo-ohki said from on top of Sasami&#39;s head. 


Author&#39;s note 

Well that&#39;s it. I honestly can&#39;t think of any kind of sex I haven&#39;t 
used yet... well maybe a few things, but you get the picture. Hope you 
enjoyed it because this is the last chapter. Email your opinions.</pre>
