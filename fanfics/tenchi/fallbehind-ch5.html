<h1>Fallen Behind (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/fallbehind-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The vision ended, and Sasami collapsed.  Minagi caught her before she 
hit the ground.  Bakari didn&#39;t move or look up.  After a moment, Washu 
strode forwards and grabbed the woman by the back of the cloak.

&quot;You, missy, are coming with me.&quot; she said, pulling Bakari behind her 
easily, &quot;And you take care of Sasami.&quot;  The diminutive scientist 
dragged the pirate out of the room, leaving everyone to contemplate 
what the hell had just happened.

&quot;So everything you&#39;ve been yapping about is true.&quot; Washu murmured, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know if I can say I&#39;m sorry for you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be.&quot; Bakari said disinterestedly, &quot;I don&#39;t deserve pity.  Do me 
a favor.  Get Ryoko to come slit my throat.&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP ALREADY, DAMMIT!&quot; Washu screamed angrily.  After opening a 
door to a room, she threw the woman into a chair and charged up to her, 
slamming her hands on either arm of the chair.

&quot;I&#39;M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU PITY, AND I&#39;M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU DEATH!  
LEARN TO DEAL WITH LOSS, YOU STUPID FOOL!&quot;  Washu panted for breath, 
having shouted at the top of her lungs in one go.  Bakari blinked at 
her, surprised out of the pity she was in.

&quot;We&#39;ve all lost something at sometime.&quot; the pink-haired woman sighed, 
&quot;You aren&#39;t the only one that&#39;s lost a loved one.&quot;  Bakari recognized 
the look in Washu&#39;s eyes as one she had worn for many a millennia.

&quot;Yume?&quot; she asked gently, &quot;The woman Kagato kidnapped?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Washu said, taking a deep breath, &quot;She&#39;s as good as dead.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure she is?  Maybe she&#39;s still alive.&quot;

&quot;Why would Kagato keep her alive?&quot; Washu&#39;s voice cracked.

&quot;Knowledge.&quot; Bakari shrugged, &quot;Didn&#39;t Yume always boast that SHE was the 
greatest scientific genius in the universe?  I suppose, if you&#39;re counting 
normal people and not goddesses, she would be.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Washu groused, &quot;I&#39;m a normal person!  A really cute one, but 
normal!&quot;

&quot;You have a problem with denial.&quot; Bakari teased a bit, &quot;You heard what 
Tsunami said.  You&#39;re a goddess.  The goddess of knowledge, if I can 
remember with this alcohol-addled head of mine.&quot;

&quot;How could I be...a goddess?&quot; Washu summoned her floating cushion and 
flopped down, &quot;I can barely believe that Tsunami is real.&quot;

&quot;Haven&#39;t you noticed all the similarities between your daughters and me?  
The energy swords, the teleportation, the flight.  The same attraction to 
booze.&quot;

&quot;And women.&quot; Washu had to laugh, &quot;Good grief, is that a trait of a 
goddess?&quot;

&quot;No.  There just seem to be a lot more women in the universe than men.&quot;

&quot;True.&quot;  The two lapsed into silence for a long while.

&quot;You became a pirate to get revenge, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  Even though I had already killed the man, I wanted everyone to pay.  
Didn&#39;t you want revenge on everything when Yume was kidnapped?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.  But I couldn&#39;t stand the idea that Kagato had her.  I just gave 
up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure Yume appreciates that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and I&#39;m sure Useni&#39;s so glad that you became a space pirate.&quot;  
Washu clapped a hand over her mouth at her statement.  That was the worst 
thing she had ever said to Bakari, and it hit home hard.  Bakari closed 
her eyes, her bruised eyes, and took a deep breath.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Washu whispered, &quot;I never should have said that.  It was 
wrong.&quot;

&quot;Do you know why I started drinking, Washu?  I wanted to forget.  I wanted 
to forget that I had lost Useni.  I wanted to forget that I had a duty to 
Tsunami.  I wanted to forget everything, even who I was.  And every night, 
every fucking night after Useni was murdered, I dreamed that she wasn&#39;t.  
I dreamed that we were just the two of us, never growing old, never having 
to worry about death or war or corruption.  And every morning, I go get 
drunk again to forget it.  I haven&#39;t had a taste of liquor since I met 
Sasami.&quot;

&quot;Bakari, why WERE you there that night?  It&#39;s stupid and reckless to try 
and steal from the royal family, even if it was you and you had your darn 
drunk luck.&quot;

&quot;I had taken a job that morning.  It was an assassination call on Sasami.  
When I got there, I found that Tsunami had assimilated with her.  I 
cancelled the job and decided to rob the place instead.&quot;

&quot;Who put the call out?&quot;

&quot;...Kagato.  Kagato put the call out, and I was too drunk to realize it.&quot;

&quot;But why?  Why would Kagato try to kill Sasami?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m not going to let anyone kill her.&quot;

&quot;One more question, please.  How did Sasami become merged with Tsunami?&quot;

&quot;It happened when Sasami was very young.  She had snuck away to look at 
the treeships, and slipped.  She fell for a very long time before hitting 
the ground where Tsunami lay dormant.  Tsunami had given me time to grieve 
and avoided merging with anyone for thousands of years.  Sasami was going 
to die if Tsunami hadn&#39;t saved her.  It was very hard for Sasami to tell 
me this.  She cried for a long time.  Afterwards, I taught her how to pick 
pockets to cheer her up.&quot;

Washu sweatdropped at the strange method of cheer Bakari had, and said, 
&quot;So are you mad at Tsunami for doing that?&quot;

&quot;I think if I had found out, I would have been angrier.  Sasami&#39;s a 
sweetheart.  Minagi certainly knows it.&quot;

&quot;Yes, well, Minagi&#39;s a sweetie, too.  And Ryoko&#39;s good in her own way.  A 
bit rough around the edges, but she&#39;s a softy.&quot;

&quot;Washu, do you understand that you&#39;re a goddess?&quot;

&quot;...I suppose.  And the three gems in Ryoko&#39;s wrists and throat.  Do you 
know what those are?&quot;

&quot;Trinkets that you liked playing with while you were pregnant with them.  
One day you couldn&#39;t find them, and Ryoko was born with them.  Minagi 
doesn&#39;t have them because Ryoko&#39;s such a little thief.  They don&#39;t mean 
anything, except for a small symbol.  Ryoko and Minagi are your daughters 
by blood, and your weapons by blood.  I guess you could call me Tsunami&#39;s 
daughter, if you want.&quot;

&quot;Does that make us relatives?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it does indeed, Aunty Washu.&quot;

&quot;Call me that again and I will break your nose.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough.&quot;

----------

Ryoko stared out the translucent crystal face of the red center Ryo-oh-ki 
had.  The visions of Bakari&#39;s past were obviously traumatic, and the 
pirate understood, if just a little, how the black-haired woman had turned 
out so badly.

&quot;Ryoko?&quot;  The cyan-haired pirate looked up to see Ayeka standing at her 
side.  Ryoko stood from her chair to give Ayeka better eye contact, and 
discovered that the princess was blushing, tears in her amethyst eyes.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Ayeka?&quot; Ryoko asked one second before Ayeka leaned against 
her, wrapping her arms around her.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to loose this moment.&quot; Ayeka murmured waveringly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
want to miss this chance.&quot;  She lifted her head from under Ryoko&#39;s chin 
and gave the pirate a soft, hesitant kiss.  Ryoko knew that Ayeka had 
stirred up her courage and was letting every defense down.  The visions 
had pushed her to move, warning the princess not to let any moment that 
love could be found escape.  And Ryoko didn&#39;t want the moment to escape 
either.

She responded in kind to the princess&#39; kiss by carefully drawing her 
closer.  Ryoko slipped her long fingers through Ayeka&#39;s hair, her other 
hand resting on the shorter woman&#39;s waist.  The kiss lasted for about a 
minute, but a glorious eternity for Ryoko and Ayeka.

&quot;First kiss?&quot; Ryoko questioned.

&quot;Yes.  How did you know?&quot; Ayeka replied.

&quot;The technique was a little off.&quot; Ryoko smiled with a wink, &quot;But it was 
wonderful.&quot;

&quot;May I try again?&quot; Ayeka blushed with a happy smile, &quot;Or perhaps you could 
teach me?&quot;

&quot;With pleasure.&quot;

----------

Minagi held Sasami gently as the princess grasped her for comfort.  It had 
been a strenuous day for everyone.  Sasami was disheartened by the 
visions, by the way her friend had to suffer in the past.  Minagi felt sad 
and disturbed as well.  She understood a bit more about Bakari.

&quot;Minagi, thank you.&quot; Sasami sniffed slightly, &quot;I&#39;m being such a baby.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot; Minagi smiled at her charmingly, &quot;I like you.  You&#39;re 
cute.&quot;  Sasami blushed and glanced down, considering something.  After a 
moment of thought, she leaned up and gave Minagi a quick kiss before 
turning red from neck to hair, including her ears.  Minagi turned a slight 
pink, but smiled anyway.

&quot;I like you, too.&quot; Sasami smiled embarrassedly.

&quot;Good.  I can tickle you then.&quot;  Sasami didn&#39;t have a chance to ask what 
she meant before Minagi descended on her, tickling her madly.  Sasami 
shrieked with giggles, barely able to breath.  The visions were driven 
from their minds, and all that Minagi and Sasami thought of was each 
other.

----------

&quot;Hey, Bakari?&quot;

&quot;...yes?&quot;

&quot;Sorry about giving you that black eye.  And don&#39;t say you deserved it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.  And I&#39;m sick of self-pity.&quot;

&quot;People shouldn&#39;t be ruled by their memories.&quot;

The two women stood side by side, staring out at the vast expanse of 
space.  They had retreated to the God&#39;s Arm to have privacy and give some 
to the others.  There was no horizon in space, no defining line of where 
it ended.  There really was no end, and no one could ever know if there 
was.  Washu heaved a sigh.

&quot;Yume was kidnapped about three months ago.&quot; she murmured, &quot;Do you really 
think she&#39;s still alive?&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s definite possibility.&quot; Bakari replied, placing a gentle hand 
on Washu&#39;s shoulder.  Washu gave a soft pat to Bakari&#39;s hand, and the 
pirate let her hand fall.

&quot;We&#39;re almost to Jurai, aren&#39;t we?&quot; Bakari asked, &quot;It was only a two and a 
half day trip at the most.&quot;

&quot;Bakari, have you ever thought of just leaving?  Just escaping right now?&quot;  
Bakari laughed softly and patted Washu on the head.  The scientist turned 
red with anger and embarrassment, slapping Bakari&#39;s hand away swiftly and 
turning to her with a glare.

&quot;No, I haven&#39;t.&quot; Bakari had turned to look at a distant star, &quot;I really 
haven&#39;t.  I&#39;m tired of pity, but I&#39;m tired of running, too.  The only 
people that can really kill me are you, Ryoko, and Minagi, and I don&#39;t 
think you&#39;ll do it.  I can spend the rest of my time in jail.&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t fair.&quot; Washu frowned, her brows knitted, &quot;Ryoko and Minagi 
have killed people.  Sure, not as many as you, but death is death.  And 
Tsunami herself said that everyone you killed was corrupted.  Can&#39;t you 
ask Ayeka to absolve your crimes?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t done anything to merit a pardon.&quot; Bakari gave a small, sad 
smile, &quot;Ryoko and Minagi got Sasami back, as well as the emperor&#39;s liquor 
and treasure.  And those two detectives are probably going to get a huge 
promotion for bringing me to justice.  Even if I did give myself up.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you do anything to save yourself from what&#39;s going to happen?&quot; 
Washu shook her head in confusion, &quot;You&#39;ve just made mistakes.  It doesn&#39;t 
if you made a lot of them, they were mistakes.&quot;

&quot;Washu, I&#39;m learning from my mistakes.  That&#39;s what this is.&quot;

&quot;No it isn&#39;t!  You&#39;re playing the martyr for all the awful people that 
blame you for everything wrong!&quot;

&quot;Then I would be a person like Kagato.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re different from him!  You know that you&#39;ve done something wrong--&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m willing to repent.&quot;  Washu&#39;s bright green eyes widened, and she 
closed them almost immediately after.  There was nothing to do to change 
Bakari&#39;s mind.  The pirate was right.  The willingness to repent set her 
apart from villains like Kagato and common thugs.  It was no longer pity 
or angst that drove Bakari to let herself be captured.  She had regained 
her spirit and knew that mistakes, no matter how few or many, had to be 
learned from.

And for Bakari, the lesson came with the cost of her freedom.

All at once, as the group of ships rounded one of Jurai&#39;s moons, alarm 
klaxons blared.  A massive ship hovered over Jurai, explosions visible 
from near the moon.  Washu let a gasp out.

&quot;The Souja!&quot; she stared at the silver ship, &quot;That&#39;s Kagato!  Kagato&#39;s 
attacking Jurai!&quot;

&quot;Looks like we can see if Yume is still alive.  Call the others.  I&#39;ve got 
an idea.&quot;

-----------

&quot;You want to wage war on Kagato?  That&#39;s the basic idea?&quot;

&quot;No, Ryoko, I mean to defeat him.&quot;  The ships were connected with video 
screens, and Bakari was explaining what her idea was.

&quot;Are you stupid or just insane?&quot; Ryoko snapped, whirling a finger around 
her ear in the universal gesture, &quot;Kagato&#39;s one mean S.O.B., and he&#39;ll 
find a way to kill you, semi-immortality or not!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe that.&quot; Bakari replied in turn, &quot;Listen, I think this&#39;ll 
work.  Just listen, all right?&quot;  Ryoko gave her another withering look but 
nodded.  &quot;Good.  Washu and I will storm the Souja, and Kiyone will search 
for Yume.  Washu, you have the location of where a prisoner might be 
held?&quot;  Washu nodded grimly.  &quot;Perfect.  Ryoko, Minagi, I want you to take 
Sasami and Ayeka back to the palace.  Minagi, I&#39;m putting Sasami&#39;s 
protection in your hands.  Don&#39;t let her out of your sight.

&quot;Mihoshi, you go with them.  There&#39;s a fight going on down there, and I 
think you can give them a good bit of hell.&quot;  Mihoshi saluted with a 
steady smile.  &quot;When this is over, you know what&#39;s going to happen.&quot;  The 
remark made Sasami&#39;s face fall, but she kept from crying.  &quot;Let&#39;s move.  
Kagato&#39;s waiting.&quot;

----------

The troops of the Jurai army were holding their own in the fires that 
spread from the battle.  Civilians had been evacuated to temples of the 
goddesses, where more soldiers stood guard to strike down the machines 
Kagato had sent to slay them all.

Most of the attack had been directed at the royal palace, and guards had 
fallen in protection.  It wouldn&#39;t be long before the guards were overrun 
and the empresses and the emperor would have to fight.  Mihoshi had been 
left with the temple in the royal city to fend off the swarms of machines 
and robots with the army.  She was doing a spectacular job.

Ryo-oh-ki had been left so the cabbit could reign hell down on the larger 
machines that decided to advance on the temples and other places.  Ryoko, 
Minagi, Ayeka, and Sasami teleported to the palace and rushed inside.  At 
once, the two pirates took up stances, swords blazing, to protect the 
princesses.

&quot;No, Ryoko, keep moving!&quot; Ayeka called as the machines came to fight, &quot;You 
need only to worry of Sasami!&quot;  Ryoko turned to look and found Ayeka 
crushing the robots and mechanical weapons with the power of a force 
field.  Both were wearing their battle armor, and Minagi was cutting down 
any machine that got in a ten-foot radius of Sasami.

&quot;Ryoko, our parents are probably swarmed already!&quot; Ayeka shouted over the 
sound of crushing metal and small explosions, &quot;We must aid them!&quot;

&quot;Got it, lady love!&quot; Ryoko replied with a smile, &quot;Minagi!  Grab Sasami and 
come on!&quot;  Minagi gathered Sasami in one arm, sword in the other, and 
followed her sister after Ayeka.  All three flew as quickly as possible, 
Ayeka in the lead, Ryoko next, and Minagi close behind.

The group rushed in through an already shattered door to find the rulers 
of Jurai locked in combat with the machines.  Ayeka saw one machine 
sneaking up towards her mother, Misaki, and hurried to her aid.  Ryoko 
took her sword up beside emperor Azusa, slashing through one that attacked 
his side.  Minagi carried Sasami into the group and placed her between all 
the warriors.

&quot;It&#39;s wonderful to see you again so soon.&quot; Funaho said calmly, her light 
blade handling as effective as her husband&#39;s.  Misaki looked up at the 
words and saw Sasami.  Tears erupted from her eyes as if from a waterfall, 
and she grabbed Sasami in a bone-cracking hug, dropping her light blade.

&quot;My Sasami!&quot; the empress cried joyfully, &quot;Oh, my Sasami, you&#39;re safe!&quot;  
She whirled the princess around, forgetting entirely about the battle at 
hand.

&quot;Empress, look out!&quot; Minagi shouted in warning.  Misaki looked up from her 
hug and found a machine ready to pounce at her and her daughter.  With 
skill not commonly associated with the somewhat zany empress, Misaki 
slipped her toe under the hilt of her blade and kicked up.  She caught the 
hilt and activated the blade, cutting down the machine easily.

&quot;You stay away from my Sasami!&quot; she shouted at all the machines.

----------

Washu strode through the hallways quickly, Bakari taking easy, loping 
steps behind her.  The scientist&#39;s hands were clenched tightly at her 
sides, a look of calm anger on her face.  It was a difficult thing to pull 
off, but Washu always managed it.

&quot;Blow this wall up.&quot; she stopped abruptly and pointed.

&quot;One dramatic explosion, coming up.&quot; Bakari lifted her hands.

&quot;Bakari, what do you plan to do when you defeat Kagato?&quot;  The question 
threw Bakari for a loop and she paused.  &quot;Are you going to kill him?  Are 
you going to kill one last person?&quot;

&quot;I might have to.&quot; Bakari&#39;s eyes were hidden under the hood of her cloak, 
&quot;I don&#39;t think any prison could hold him.&quot;

&quot;No prison can hold you, but you&#39;ll still stay.&quot;

&quot;Because I have to.&quot;  Bakari cut the conversation short and fired a shot 
of energy into the stonewall.  It exploded in a cloud of dust, and the two 
women walked into the darkness that followed.

-----------

Kiyone pressed herself against the wall, peering around the corner 
carefully.  There was no telling what kind of traps Kagato had set to keep 
rescuers out and prisoners in.  So far, nothing had gone wrong.  Kiyone 
waited for the moment where everything would go down the hole, but it 
never came.  The detective let out a sigh of silly relief.

Mihoshi wasn&#39;t there.  No wonder nothing had gone wrong.  Mihoshi was an 
admitted klutz, but a sweetheart.  That was why Kiyone loved her.

At the next corner, Kiyone spotted the universally used bars of a cell.  
Glancing around swiftly, she scurried up to the cell and peered through 
the bars.  A small shape sat on the floor, and Kiyone watched intently for 
breathing.  A moment later, the shape turned to reveal a face.  The face 
of the second greatest scientific genius in the universe, Yume, in fact.

&quot;Yume?&quot; Kiyone asked gently, &quot;You&#39;re Yume, right?&quot;

&quot;Figure that out on your own?&quot; Yume said bitingly, &quot;Who&#39;re you?  Kagato&#39;s 
new model of robot?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m detective first class Kiyone from the GP.&quot; Kiyone aimed her pistol at 
the door of the cell, &quot;I&#39;m here with Washu to rescue you.&quot;  Yume visibly 
brightened at the name.  She stood shakily from the floor, her eyes wide 
in hope.  Kiyone fired a shot and the door swung open.

&quot;Washu&#39;s really here to rescue me?&quot; the smaller of the women asked.  
Kiyone nodded.  Yume smiled, and said, &quot;Took her long enough.&quot;  Kiyone 
just sweatdropped.

----------

&quot;Tell me, Kagato, is it some stupid requirement to have a ridiculously 
huge organ if you want to be a villain?&quot;

The most wanted criminal Kagato looked up from the keyboard to find his 
old teacher, Washu, and the space pirate Bakari standing on a walkway.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised to see you&#39;re still alive, Bakari.&quot; Kagato murmured in his 
irritating way, &quot;Instead of killing the princess like I told you to, you 
kidnapped her instead.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t do either, but what do you care?&quot; Bakari summoned her sword, 
&quot;All I&#39;m here for is you.&quot;

&quot;What, no long-winded speech of who you&#39;re fighting for?&quot; Kagato called 
forth his own green blade, &quot;No proclamation of my downfall?  What a 
strange anti-hero you are.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a hero.&quot; Bakari shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t give speeches.  I&#39;m just 
a servant of Tsunami, and I know that I need to do the universe a giant 
favor and get rid of you.&quot;

&quot;The universe?&quot; Kagato laughed scornfully, &quot;What has the universe done for 
you?  Despised you, hated you, put a price upon your head.  You have no 
reason to do anything for all those filthy creatures.&quot;

&quot;No, I really don&#39;t.&quot; Bakari smiled in that sad way she had, &quot;But it&#39;s the 
right thing.  So, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to kill you today.&quot;

&quot;Go ahead and try.&quot;
