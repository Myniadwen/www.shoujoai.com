<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 3 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/onceagain-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>There was a quiet bustle to the hotsprings town, the
sense of things moving forward as people began to
arrive for the summer season. Up at the Cafe Hinata
things were picking up, too, with more people coming
in for the good food as well as visiting the lovely
young ladies who ran the place.

Mitsune Konno smiled as she set the order down in
front of Ema. &quot;So, there&#39;s a new fortune teller in
town?&quot; Kitsune asked.

Ema Maeda nodded, her long brown hair flowing down her
back, her pet lizard perched on her shoulder.
Possessed of a unusual interest in the supernatural,
conspiracies and other similar things she was a
reliable source of info. &quot;Apparently she&#39;s quite
good,&quot; Ema said, &quot;using tea leaves and astrology, I&#39;ve
heard.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Kitsune looked thoughtful as she mused, &quot;wonder
if I could get some good numbers from her for the
races?&quot;

&quot;Somehow, I just knew you were going to say that,&quot;
Shinobu Maehara noted as she took off her Cafe Hinata
apron and sat down by Ema. She looked at the other
woman thoughtfully, &quot;Have you been down to see her,
yet?&quot;

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Ema admitted, &quot;I was a bit too nervous to
go on my own.&quot;

&quot;You were looking for some of us to come down with
you?&quot; Kitsune asked shrewdly. She smiled slightly,
&quot;What the hell, sounds interesting.&quot;

Not long after Kitsune, Ema and Shinobu were heading
into town, walking down the flight of steps from the
dorm. Both Ema and Shinobu wore summer dresses, skirts
flowing around them while Kitsune had chosen simple
slacks, her t-shirt tucked into her pants.

&quot;Did Mitsumi mind closing up the cafe?&quot; Ema asked
curiously.

&quot;No,&quot; Kitsune shook her head, &quot;she could use a
afternoon off.&quot; She grinned, &quot;Besides, we&#39;re doing
well enough we can afford to take a day off or two.&quot;

&quot;Does that mean I get a raise, Kitsune-sempai?&quot;
Shinobu asked impishly, then both she and Ema laughed
at the startled look on her face.

&quot;Very funny,&quot; Kitsune shook her head with a smile,
&quot;remind me to sick Su on you when she&#39;s feeling really
needy.&quot;

Seeing Ema&#39;s faintly confused expression Shinobu
explained, &quot;Koalla Su is a very nice girl, but
occasionally she gets a bit lonely for home. She tends
to fixate on certain people, and can get a bit...
enthusiastic playing with them.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Ema nodded.

The trio wove through the shops and people, nodding
greetings to the people they knew. Eventually they
reached a shop that had closed down last year, now
reopened with a sign advertising fortune telling. It
was all decorated fairly simply, newly painted walls
and door, the only unusual element being the lovely
roses that someone had painted.

&quot;All right,&quot; Kitsune led the way, &quot;let&#39;s check this
out.&quot;

A bell rang as they pushed the door open, the shadowed
room beyond lit by small lights. The violet haired
young woman looked up then chuckled, &quot;Welcome.&quot;

&quot;Anthy-san?&quot; Ema blinked, recognizing the new resident
of the Hinata Dorm.

&quot;I&#39;ll be...&quot; Kitsune smiled slightly, studying Anthy
thoughtfully. Boldly she asked, &quot;Are you the real
thing?&quot;

Anthy looked more amused than anything else,
&quot;Actually, yes.&quot;

&quot;Kitsune!&quot; Shinobu scolded then turned to Anthy, &quot;I&#39;m
sorry Miss Himemiya, I don&#39;t know what she was
thinking....&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Anthy reassured her, &quot;I&#39;m well aware
of how many fake fortune tellers there are.&quot; She took
a teapot and poured carefully into two cups, &quot;Who
would like to go first?&quot;

&quot;Could I?&quot; Ema looked at the others, then when they
nodded she took a seat in front of the table Anthy sat
at.

&quot;Drink your tea,&quot; Anthy smiled at her as she sipped
from her own cup, &quot;then we&#39;ll begin.&quot;

The tea itself had a odd strawberry tinge, smoothly
going down as the candles flickered around them.
Putting her cup down she smiled, &quot;I&#39;m done.&quot;

Anthy took the cup from her with an oddly serene
expression, gazing into the cup contemplatively. &quot;You
arrived at the Hinata Dorm hoping to enter Tokyo
University,&quot; she murmured, &quot;because of the stories you
heard about it&#39;s powers.&quot; Softly Ema gasped as Anthy
continued, &quot;You intend to apply your research skills
as a librarian.&quot;

&quot;How did you...?&quot; Ema blurted. She knew her research
about the Hinata Dorm was known there, she had
mentioned it to Shinobu for instance, but she hadn&#39;t
told anyone about her interest in being a librarian.

Quietly Anthy continued, &quot;I can&#39;t foresee if you&#39;ll
succeed in achieving that goal, but you will make it
into Tokyo U.&quot;

&quot;Me next,&quot; Kitsune said firmly once Ema had gotten up.
She sat down and drank her tea from a fresh cup,
wondering about this oddly enigmatic woman across from
her.

Taking the cup Anthy smiled, studying the remains
thoughtfully. &quot;In business you&#39;ve largely been
successful,&quot; she finally said seriously, &quot;but love has
been more difficult. Your first true love you gave up
to someone who was like a sister to you, while the
other you have never spoken of.&quot;

Kitsune blinked, &quot;I&#39;ll be damned. There&#39;s no way that
you could have learned that from talking to anyone at
the dorm.&quot;

Shinobu took her turn, then the four of them left the
shop after Anthy decided to close up. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I
said anything inappropriate,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;I
don&#39;t always control what I say.&quot;

&quot;Are you psychic?&quot; Ema asked eagerly.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Anthy said as she pushed her
hair back nervously, &quot;I don&#39;t know all the details
myself.&quot;

&#39;Now why do I get the feeling she&#39;s lying?&#39; Kitsune
wondered.

Shinobu had a faintly.. disturbed look on her face. &quot;I
didn&#39;t like what I heard,&quot; she finally said to Anthy
softly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Anthy said. Taking a breath, &quot;I could be
wrong, and a person&#39;s fate is unwritten until it
happens. You can make other choices.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; Shinobu sighed, &quot;I think I always knew I
couldn&#39;t have sempai, but having it spelled out that
way hurt.&quot;

Ema reached out to gently squeeze Shinobu&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;And it doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t fall in love with
someone else,&quot; she said softly.

Shinobu brightened a bit, &quot;True.&quot;

Kitsune looked down at Anthy, studying the young woman
in her almost archaic dress. &quot;Would you be interested
in a business opportunity?&quot; Kitsune asked with a grin.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Anthy looked up at her curiously.

&lt;o0o0o0o0o0o&gt;

&quot;What?&quot; Motoko Aoyama blinked in surprise, reaching up
to feed her bird Shippu, currently perched on her
shoulder.

&quot;A ghost busting company,&quot; Kitsune continued, &quot;or
maybe even more.&quot; Anthy sat beside her, looking on
with bemused interest more than anything else.

&quot;Why would I want to...?&quot; Motoko trailed off.

&quot;You yourself mentioned to me that you wanted to use
your God&#39;s Cry training to help people,&quot; Kitsune said
patiently, &quot;this could be a excellent way to do so.&quot;

Motoko looked at Anthy, &quot;And you&#39;re involved in this?&quot;

&quot;More waiting to see,&quot; Anthy smiled, &quot;I have certain
gifts that Kitsune thinks might come in handy.&quot; A
thoughtful pause, &quot;I think an old friend of mine would
be very amused to find me involved in something like
this.&quot;

&#39;Interesting,&#39; Motoko blinked.

&quot;I already have a name in mind and can have business
cards printed by the end of the week,&quot; Kitsune said
eagerly.

&quot;What would you call this little venture?&quot; Motoko
blinked.

A smile from Kitsune, &quot;I was talking to an associate,
she says we can be a branch of the Phantom Quest
Corp.&quot;</pre>
