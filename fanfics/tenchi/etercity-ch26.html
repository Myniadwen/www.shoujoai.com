<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 26 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>The great Crystal Tokyo Public Library was one of the
largest in the world, as well as one of the best
sources for information in all of Earth space. Founded
back in the twentieth century as part of the Great
British Library it had grown and changed over time,
eventually dedicating itself to the preservation of
rare books and information for future generations.

Taking up all of what was once a massive underground
subway station and the tower that was directly above
it, the Library was over twenty stories tall. Each
level was focused on sub-disciplines and specialties,
from various areas of science and research to the
historic preservation of original books and rare
documents. Teeming with people it was one of the most
popular places in Crystal Tokyo both for serious
business or pleasure reading.

&quot;Ran!&quot; a voice called out and the young woman turned,
eyes sweeping the room cautiously until she saw who it
was. The tall redheaded man reached her side in only a
moment, his crisp military-style uniform fitting him
like a glove. Touga Kiryuu nodded to her with a
slightly chiding tone, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

&quot;Touga,&quot; Ran Mizuno nodded back, her own dark eyes
lighting up with gentle amusement. Her short blue hair
a bit ruffled by the day&#39;s pleasant breeze, the
clothes she had chosen a bit on the conservative side.
She kept her cane handy, her wounds aching more this
morning after yesterday&#39;s exertions in the borrowed
hardsuit. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you, sir.&quot;

&quot;So formal sounding,&quot; Touga smiled down at her
impishly. He fell into step beside her, carefully
matching the young woman&#39;s pace as they moved through
the level dedicated to Crystal Tokyo archives. &quot;Having
changed your diapers occasionally,&quot; he continued, &quot;I&#39;d
think I&#39;d rate a Uncle Touga or something.&quot;

Ran couldn&#39;t help her laugh as she stopped by a
bookcase. &quot;Somehow I can&#39;t quite see you as a uncle,&quot;
she admitted, &quot;you don&#39;t seem to be the type.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; he conceded, &quot;though I understand my sister
Nanami and Miki are expecting.&quot; Touga looked amused,
&quot;We were wondering what was taking so long.&quot;

&quot;And are you seeing anyone?&quot; Ran asked him curiously.
Touga Kiryuu was one of Crystal Tokyo&#39;s most notorious
bachelors, sometimes dating more than one lady at a
time.

&quot;No,&quot; Touga shook his head then smirked, &quot;at least not
seriously.&quot;

&quot;Why am I not surprised?&quot;

&quot;Saionji-sensei,&quot; Ran felt herself smiling as she took
in the green haired kendoist, his traditional katana
carried over his shoulder.

&quot;You&#39;re not my sword student anymore,&quot; Saionji
reminded her, the older man&#39;s eyes twinkling with
amusement, &quot;you don&#39;t need to call me that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a gesture of respect,&quot; Ran nodded to him.

&quot;So he gets respect and I don&#39;t?&quot; Touga looked
mock-outraged.

&quot;Pretty much, yes,&quot; Ran said cheerfully.

&quot;You walked right into that one,&quot; Saionji commented.

Touga chuckled, running a hand through his long red
hair as he admitted, &quot;Looks like it, yes.&quot; He
hesitated a moment, &quot;So how are your legendary
recuperative powers working?&quot;

&quot;Legendary?&quot; Ran quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Mother confirms
I won&#39;t need the cane soon,&quot; she admitted, &quot;though she
still wants me in the clinic to be examined.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re avoiding that like the plague,&quot; Saionji
predicted.

&quot;True,&quot; Ran agreed.

Saionji and Touga each exchanged a glance, unsure of
what exactly to say. They were well aware of the
long-standing troubles between Ran and her mothers
Lady Mercury and Mars, but what to do about it was
questionable. Not to mention Ran&#39;s quite natural
resistance to having people meddle in her affairs...

&quot;Part of why I sought you out,&quot; Touga commented after
they settled down into one of the library&#39;s many
tables, &quot;was to let you know that the investments I&#39;m
handling for you are doing remarkably well.&quot; He smiled
wryly as he just had to ask, &quot;How did you know
Technodyne was going to do so well?&quot;

Ran smiled as she relaxed a bit, the sun shining in
through one of the tower&#39;s old fashioned windows. &quot;I
didn&#39;t, I just bet on the tide of history,&quot; she
explained, &quot;Technodyne is one of the best developers
for military technology.&quot;

Touga looked pained, &quot;That&#39;s a very cynical view.&quot;

Ran looked over at her former teacher,
&quot;Saionji-sensei, would you care to explain?&quot;

Saionji sighed softly. Along with his maintaining of
the Gods Cry school of swordsmanship he served in the
government, specifically in the Self-defense Forces
for Earth. As a side effect he was better informed
than most on military matters both in Earth-space and
in neighboring regions.

&quot;Earth, Jurai and the Khanite have all been fairly
stable for the past few years,&quot; Saionji mused
thoughtfully, &quot;but other than that there&#39;s been a
steady growth of conflict in the other major galactic
powers.&quot; He made a face, &quot;Not to mention the war
movement in Jurai and the Khanite&#39;s recent
expeditionary adventures.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s part of how I got myself injured,&quot; Ran
admitted, &quot;we were patrolling out near the Erehwon
border and got ambushed.&quot;

&quot;Erehwon, they&#39;re part of the League I believe?&quot; Touga
asked.

&quot;The League of Non-aligned worlds, yes,&quot; Saionji
confirmed.

&quot;Though how anyone can actually regard them as a
political entity I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ran said a bit
bitterly, &quot;they have almost no central police force
and their foreign policies are such a mess that they
barely exist.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Touga acknowledged. He looked
thoughtful, &quot;The only way that we send trading ships
through there now is in convoys with an armed escort.&quot;

&quot;I almost wish Crystal Tokyo would take action,&quot; Ran
noted.

Saionji smiled wryly, &quot;Wars of conquest have never
been Queen Serenity&#39;s style.&quot;

&quot;Not even if the people would probably be happier
under her rule?&quot; Ran challenged.

Not even then,&quot; Saionji answered.

Touga looked over at Ran thoughtfully, &quot;And what are
the Khanite&#39;s intentions?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be leaking secrets if I said the Khan and
his advisors have considered it,&quot; Ran answered
promptly, &quot;but that place is such a mess it would take
years to fully deal with.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Saionji admitted. He decided to change
the subject, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you could come to one of
my classes?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Ran blinked.

Saionji smiled at her impishly, &quot;It&#39;s had to
demonstrate the advanced sword techniques without a
worthy opponent.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Ran spoke up quickly, &quot;I&#39;ve seen what you can
do, sensei. I have no wish to be on the receiving end
of some of the God&#39;s Cry techniques.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Touga grinned, &quot;I&#39;d pay good money to
see that!&quot;

&quot;Touga,&quot; a scolding voice came from nearby, &quot;don&#39;t
tease the poor girl!&quot;

Touga&#39;s face seemed to light up as the tall blonde
walked over to looked down at him fondly. &quot;Sorry,
Honey,&quot; he said, &quot;I got carried away.&quot;

Ran blinked, recognizing the lovely blonde woman after
a few moments, &quot;Honey-chan? As in, Cutey Honey?&quot;

Honey smiled warmly at Ran, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s been a long
time.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve met?&quot; Ran blinked.

Honey looked a bit sheepish as she bowed slightly, &quot;I
was one of the officers Lady Mars assigned to keep an
eye on you, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Ran nodded thoughtfully, &quot;You used your disguise
powers.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Honey agreed. She took a breath, &quot;I hope
that you&#39;ll excuse my actions.&quot;

There was a frown on Ran&#39;s face but she nodded
slightly, &quot;I guess I can understand.&quot;

Saionji smiled wryly, &quot;Considering how inseparable
Touga and Honey can be, I&#39;m glad that she retired from
the service after that little escapade.&quot;

&quot;I thought I was a bodyguard,&quot; Honey explained a
little awkwardly, &quot;I didn&#39;t know I was spying on you
without your permission.&quot; She frowned, &quot;I was quite
annoyed at Mars for that.&quot;

&quot;Join the club,&quot; Ran said much more gently.</pre>
