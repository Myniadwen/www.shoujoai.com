<h1>No Need for Halloween</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;I really don&#39;t know about this,&quot; Tennyo
Masaki blinked, the white haired woman studying the
costume critically. The black leather hugged her slim
body while revealing her curves in a naughty sort of
way.

Washu Hakubi grinned as the little redhead
said, &quot;Hey, if you got it flaunt it!&quot; Her own outfit
resembled a elf, with little wings attached to the
back and a green outfit that went well with her
flaming hair.

&quot;Besides, you made it back just in time for
the party,&quot; Ryouko grinned, her call girl&#39;s costume
swirling around her long legs. She gave Washu a look,
&quot;Why in hell do I have to wear a stupid outfit like
this?&quot;

Washu gave her daughter a look, &quot;Trust me, it
goes with Ayeka&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Oh ho,&quot; Ryouko grinned.

Noike smiled slightly as she entered the
changing room, the green haired woman wearing a
similar black leather outfit to Tennyo&#39;s. Taking in
the other leather clad woman she gave Washu a look,
&quot;Are you plotting something?&quot;

&quot;Would I do that?&quot; Washu tried to look
innocent.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Noike said, her
expression faintly troubled.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Tennyo gave the other
woman a curious glance.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Noike smiled reassuringly before
addressing Washu, &quot;there&#39;s just something I want to
ask you later.&quot;

Washu raised a euebrow but nodded,
&quot;Certainly.&quot;

&quot;Washu,&quot; Ayeka frowned as she entered in a
tuxedo, &quot;this costume seems oddly innapropriate
for...&quot; She trailed off seeing Ryouko in the sexy
outfit then felt a smile tug at her lips. &quot;I see,&quot; she
blinked.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Ryouko murmured, looking at the
black clad Ayeka admiringly. She reached out to tug at
her purple hair, &quot;Howdy sailor, new in town?&quot;

&quot;Ryouko,&quot; Ayeka blushed.

&quot;Let&#39;s go see if the others are ready,&quot; Tennyo
smiled slightly as they left the bedroom and went down
stairs.

&quot;Why a pirate?&quot; Tenchi asked, an eyepatch
covering one eye, leather pants and a baggy shirt
completing the look for the black haired young man.

&quot;Tenchi,&quot; Mihoshi squealed as the blonde
haired girl nearly tackled him to the ground as she
snuggled close.

&quot;Pirates get the chicks,&quot; Ryouko shrugged, &quot;I
should know.&quot;

&quot;Food&#39;s ready,&quot; Sasami said cheerfully, the
little girl emerging in her adult form, a fur bikini
top and bottom her only covering.

&quot;Sasami, what are you doing dressed like
that?&quot; Ayeka blurted.

&quot;You should see what Minagi and I were going
to wear,&quot; Sasami smirked as she carried in food to the
table.

Minagi, Ryouko&#39;s twin with matching scars on
her cheeks carried in more food while dressed in a
barbarian outfit complete with armor and axe over her
shoulder. &quot;Sasami wanted mistress and slave costumes,&quot;
she explained.

&quot;That&#39;d be a bit much,&quot; Tenchi admitted. He
smiled faintly and asked, &quot;Is grandfather dressing
up?&quot;

&quot;That old stick in the mud?&quot; Washu laughed.

&quot;Well, father&#39;s staying in town with Rea
Masaki, so he&#39;s fine,&quot; Tenchi added.

&quot;So it&#39;s that way,&quot; Tennyo murmured. A faint
smile appeared on her face as she added, &quot;I&#39;m happy
for them.&quot;

So they shared dinner and goofed around in
costumes for much of the night. It was a bit sad that
Tenchi&#39;s home was so far away and children rarely
ventured there, but they had a good time anyway.
Especially once Ryouko broke out the sake...

&quot;Washu?&quot; Noike asked later that evening as she
entered the lab to see Washu pondering the main
computer, her experiments extending in all directions
in the pocket dimension.

&quot;Slipped away from the party?&quot; Washu turned in
her seat to smile.

&quot;I did say I wanted to talk to you,&quot; Noike
reminded her.

&quot;Have there been any side effects since we
found out you contained Kagato&#39;s female aspect?&quot; Washu
asked gently.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Noike made a face,
&quot;it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
&quot;Yes?&quot; Washu leaned forward, intrigued.

&quot;You cloned Kagato from your friend Naja Akara
after she died,&quot; Noike began, &quot;and tried to transfer
her memories and personality.&quot;

&quot;Which obviously didn&#39;t work as planned,&quot;
Washu said wryly, &quot;or Kagato wouldn&#39;t have betrayed me
that way.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s...not quite so,&quot; Noike sighed.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Washu blinked.

&quot;When Kagato rejected his female half and she
seperated from him the Naja memories and personality
were carried with her,&quot; Noike revealed.

&quot;You have them, now that she merged with you,&quot;
Washu realized.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Noike nodded.

&quot;Well,&quot; Washu actually blushed, looking away,
&quot;ah, how much do you recall?&quot;

Noike looked almost as embarassed as she said,
&quot;Pretty much all of it. Your academy days, your
marriage and son, her falling in love with you and all
the rest.&quot;

&quot;Right, I...,&quot; Washu froze then looked at
Noike in surprise, &quot;Falling in love with me?&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t know?&quot; Noike blinked.

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t,&quot; Washu confessed, looking more
than a little shocked. &quot;We worked together for fifteen
thousand years...how could I not know?&quot;

Noike reached out to put a comforting hand on
Washu&#39;s. &quot;Maybe because she didn&#39;t want you to know?&quot;
she suggested gently. She sighed, trying to organize
her thoughts, &quot;I don&#39;t know everything, but she knew
you were grieving for your lost husband and child,
too.&quot;

&quot;You do remember a lot,&quot; Washu gave her a weak
smile. She sighed, &quot;I&#39;m going to need some time to
digest all of this.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Noike said, &quot;but I would like
to talk about this more later.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Washu agreed.

Noike walked to the door to the lab then
turned, seeing Washu lost to her thoughts. &#39;I wonder
when I should tell her that I have Naja&#39;s feelings
along with her memories?&#39; she mused as she slipped
from the room.
The End...?

Notes: This is set after the end of Tench 3, OVA #6,
as well as based on information from the Tenchi Muyo
novels. The wikipedia entry on Kagato was a big help
as well. The relationship between Naja and Washu is
mostly a product of my imagination, however.... </pre>
