It hadn&#39;t snowed this year, the weather alternating
between slush and rain and Tendo Nabiki felt a flash
of annoyance with the season as she finished with the
accounting paperwork. The table she borrowed in the
corner was secluded but not quiet, women rushing too
and fro as the Christmas party continued. The roof and
walls were hung with red, green and gold garlands and
all the staff wore antlers along with their usual
clothes.

&quot;Hey, Nabiki,&quot; Minagi dropped off a mug of spiked
eggnog, her long blue hair shimmering as she gave a
friendly smile. As usual she was wearing a simple
dress, a soft blue green gown that highlighted her
golden eyes.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nabiki took the cup, gesturing for Minagi to
sit. &quot;Things busy at the bar?&quot; the black haired woman
asked curiously, her black pants and vest giving her a
sleek look.

&quot;Ryouko and Mahoro are handling things,&quot; Minagi
informed her. Her lips twitched with a smile, &quot;We
tried Alpha behind the bar, but all she can make is
coffee.&quot;

Nabiki chuckled, &quot;I can imagine.&quot;

Minagi hesitated a moment, &quot;I wanted to ask you
something, but...&quot;

Nabiki looked at her thoughtfully a moment, &quot;Ayaka and
I?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen her at the Locket in months,&quot; Minagi
looked a bit sheepish as she asked, &quot;is something
wrong?&quot;

&quot;You could say that.&quot; In a very soft voice Nabiki
said, &quot;She gave me my ring back.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Minagi narrowed her eyes, looking at Nabiki
in concern. &quot;Why would she...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather not talk about it,&quot; Nabiki said flatly,
her lips pressed into a hard line.

Minagi reached out to gently pat Nabiki&#39;s arm,
&quot;Sorry.&quot;

Nabiki forced a smile, &quot;Not your fault.&quot;

Minagi got up, smiling wryly as she lied, &quot;I think
things are getting busy at the bar, do you mind if
I...?&quot;

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Nabiki answered as she drank a bit more
eggnog.

Outside two young women hurried through the rain, one
grumbling to the other. &quot;If I had known it was going
to rain,&quot; Chiko murmured as the blonde lead the way to
the lee side of the Locket&#39;s building, &quot;I&#39;d have
brought an umbrella.&quot;

&quot;They did forcast it earlier,&quot; Bando noted, her short
black hair falling into her eyes as she tried to
shield her glasses from the rain.

&quot;They were wrong before,&quot; Chiko shrugged, the two of
them heading towards the front door.

A tall, brown skinned woman guarded the door, watching
the comings and goings with a flinty expression.
&quot;Identification?&quot; Mana Tatsumiya asked flatly, dressed
in a leather jacket over a one piece combat outfit,
her long black hair shimmering.

&quot;Here,&quot; both Chiko and Bando passed over their cards.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Mana studied them then handed them back. &quot;Be
careful not to cause a disturbance,&quot; she added, &quot;or
you&#39;ll be... dealt with.&quot;

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Bando blinked as they headed up the hall
into the nightclub.

Chiko shook her head, &quot;There&#39;s something scary about
that lady.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s locket!&quot; the incredibly perky
blonde smiled. &quot;I&#39;m Excel Excel, how can we serve
you?&quot;

Bando raised a eyebrow, &quot;A seat would be nice.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get this one,&quot; a busty brown haired woman smiled
at Excel before bowing to the girls slightly, her
black and white maid&#39;s uniform swirling around her
shaple legs. &quot;My name is May,&quot; she said as she lead
them to a table, &quot;shall I get you a drink?&quot;

&quot;A cola?&quot; Chiko asked.

Bando nodded her agreement, &quot;I&#39;ll take the same.&quot;

Taking their orders May hurried off, soon returning
with their drinks in lightly frosted glasses. &quot;Enjoy,&quot;
she said as she set them down, &quot;and just wave if you
need anything.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Chiko smiled as the older girl hurried away.
Turning back to Bando she relaxed a little, &quot;What a
crazy few weeks.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s been pretty crazy since we found Task&#39;s
cellphone,&quot; Bando agreed feelingly.

Task had organized a suicide club, a group of teens
willing to kill themselves on the same day. Their only
lifeline was a cell phone they had deliberately left
at the train station, which would guide whoever found
it to them. Chiko picked it up and originally didn&#39;t
believe the calls about a death... until she witnessed
the first suicide. Bando at her side Chiko had raced
across the city trying to stop the suicides, in the
process learning a lot about herself and her fellows.

&quot;Bando?&quot; Chiko said as she sipped her drink, &quot;did I
ever tell you what I did when I gave you the phone and
left for a while?&quot;

&quot;I figured you went home and changed,&quot; Bando mused.

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Chiko flashed a smile, &quot;I went to a
kareoke place with our classmates until my conscience
made me rejoin you.&quot; She leaned a bit closer to Bando,
&quot;They told mt something interesting about you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Bando tried to look casual.

Chiko reached out to squeeze her hand comfortingly.
&quot;Why do you seem to watch me so much?&quot; she asked
quietly.

Bando looked down, blushing a bit. &quot;You&#39;re
interesting,&quot; she admitted, &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to
figure you out for a while now.&quot;

&quot;Trying to see beneath the party girl exterior?&quot; Chiko
said gently.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Bando agreed.

Chiko stroked the skin of Bando&#39;s hand, enjoying
watching the blush spread over her skin. &quot;Just that?&quot;
she asked warmly.

&quot;Chiko...&quot; Bando&#39;s voice had a warning edge to it as
she said, &quot;are you sure you know what you&#39;re doing?&quot;

Chiko picked up Bando&#39;s hand and kissed the back
softly, &quot;I think so.&quot;

Meanwhile Arisugawa Juri was up at the bar drinking
some sparkling ginger ale, a frown on the orange
haired woman&#39;s face. &quot;Damn,&quot; she muttered to Minagi,
&quot;I never heard about it, either. I thought they were
happy together.&quot;

Setsuna nodded, the raven haired woman wearing a green
colored gown. &quot;I feel kind of guilty we didn&#39;t notice,
with the wedding and all,&quot; she admitted.

Alpha looked at both women earnestly from where the
green haired android was sorting a drink tray. &quot;Don&#39;t
take this on yourselves,&quot; she advised, &quot;I don&#39;t know
Miss Nabiki well but if she wanted to tell you she
would have.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Ryouko agreed, Minagi&#39;s twin
looking fierce in her standard black and red one piece
garb. &quot;However,&quot; she added with a scowl, &quot;I think we
should look into this...&quot;

&quot;Descretely,&quot; Juri quickly said, &quot;Nabiki&#39;d get very
upset if she found out.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Minagi nodded firmly.

Two women strode in, both grown women and dressed in
fine clothing. The taller black haired woman shrugged
off her coat to reveal creamy shoulders in a low cut
dress. &quot;Michiko, take my coat,&quot; she ordered, nearly
tossing it to her companion.

The purple haired woman caught it, resentment
vibrating from every pour as Michiko submissively
answered, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;You can call me Keiko in public,&quot; the tall black
haired woman smirked as they strode to a empty table.
Keiko sat first, taking a seat in a commanding way
while Michiko sat down a bit more nervously. Keiko had
a mysterious smile as she looked at Michiko, &quot;Scared I
was going to use you as a chair in public?&quot;

Michiko blushed pink, looking away as horrid memories
boiled up. Shortly after Keiko took her job as a
Weather Report girl she had humiliated Michiko on the
air, nearly destroying her career and putting her at
Keiko&#39;s mercy. Keiko had hired Michiko as her
assistant, then proceeded to treat her as a virtual
slave, even using her in place of a chair!

&quot;What can I get you?&quot; Hyatt asked weakly, the black
haired girl swaying weakly.

&quot;Long Island iced tea,&quot; Keiko calmly replied.

&quot;Just a beer,&quot; Michiko sighed.

Hyatt collapsed as both women watched her snake the
way to the bar, have the order set on her tray and
then snake her way back over. &quot;Anything else?&quot; Hyatt
asked.

&quot;We might order later,&quot; Keiko shrugged.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you dragged me here,&quot; Michiko
muttered to herself softly, &quot;are you a pervert as well
as a sex maniac?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m perverted?&quot; Keiko reached out and pushed up
Michiko&#39;s eyes to meet hers, &quot;I&#39;m just doing what you
want me to.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re joking,&quot; Michiko protested weakly.

Keiko smiled back as she leaned over and purred, &quot;I&#39;ve
never been more serious, my little masochist.&quot; She
looked into Michiko&#39;s eyes, &quot;Don&#39;t try to deny you got
wet when I used you as a chair... or dressed you up
sluty on camera. I could SMELL it on you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not like that,&quot; Michiko protested softly.

&quot;Just keep telling yourself that,&quot; Keiko smirked.
