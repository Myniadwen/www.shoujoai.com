<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 59 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a>

<a href="../tenchi/locket-ch58.html">Back to Part 58</a><pre>&quot;Well,&quot; Cathy smiled as the redhead looked over at her companions, &quot;you 
have to admit it&#39;s different than Valerian&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;This is bizarre,&quot; Arisugawa Juri muttered, looking around the Locket 
with the oddest look on her face. She was dressed pretty casually, 
having barely gotten home before Dorothy had arrived telling them about 
a nightclub they had to visit.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Dorothy Catalonia smirked, &quot;I think it&#39;s 
fascinating.&quot;

Juri rolled her eyes. It was odd enough coming into a bar with the same 
name as hers but to find out it was run by some kind of alternate 
universe version of her was too strange. Around them a ocean of young 
woman swirled and talked animatedly as waitresses and servers hurried 
about to fill orders for food and drink.

&quot;I&#39;m just glad Duo wasn&#39;t around,&quot; Cathy mentioned her boyfriend with a 
smile, &quot;he&#39;d probably be trying to sneak in.&quot;

&quot;You noticed that bouncer?&quot; Dorothy smiled as she continued on, &quot;Poor 
Duo would be lucky to survive if she caught him.&quot;

That got a ghost of a smile from Juri.

&quot;Arisugawa-san,&quot; one of the waitresses gave her a smile, her long brown 
hair tied back in a braid. The suit she wore hugged a slim body, her 
expression gently friendly. &quot;My name is Keiko,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll be your 
server today.&quot;

Juri blinked, remembering seeing a very different Keiko on the UC Ohtori 
campus. &quot;Ah, right,&quot; she smiled, &quot;drinks all around, please. I could use 
a glass of wine.&quot;

Keiko smoothly collected the orders from the other two ladies then 
smiled as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few minutes.&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Cathy whispered once Keiko was gone, &quot;I could almost go gay 
over that one.&quot;

Juri just shook her head. She looked over at Dorothy thoughtfully, 
remembering something she wanted to ask her, &quot;So what&#39;s going on between 
you and Shiori?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure,&quot; Dorothy answered honestly.

Cathy blinked in honest surprise. &quot;You and Shiori?&quot; She asked Dorothy 
angrily, &quot;Even after all that Shiori did to Juri?!&quot;

&quot;Leave her alone,&quot; Juri shook her head.

&quot;You&#39;re far too forgiving,&quot; Dorothy remarked softly.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Keiko arrived with a tray carrying their drinks. She 
passed them out before bowing slightly, &quot;If there&#39;s anything else you 
need, just ask.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dorothy gave her a charming smile.

Keiko moved to go before she remembered something. She looked over at 
Cathy, &quot;Thanks for the compliment, but I&#39;m seeing someone.&quot; With that 
she was gone.

&quot;Oh god,&quot; Cathy&#39;s face was beet red, &quot;she heard me?&quot;

Juri chuckled softly, &quot;Well, at least she wasn&#39;t offended.&quot; She took a 
sip of her drink, &quot;Let&#39;s just hope her girlfriend doesn&#39;t find out.&quot;

Dorothy drank a bit of her martini, &quot;I&#39;m surprised to hear you asking me 
about my love life.&quot; She smiled a dangerous little smile, &quot;Considering 
you and Kanoe.&quot;

Cathy looked back and forth between them and sighed, &quot;You two....&quot;

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Juri breathed out, recognizing the woman on the kareoke 
stage.

Dorothy followed her gaze up then blinked, &quot;I&#39;ll be damned.&quot;

Kanoe had the faintest of smiles on her face as she zeroed in on their 
table, her eyes meeting Juri&#39;s in a long moment. &quot;This is for you,&quot; her 
voice dropping to as sexy purr, everyone at the table sure that she was 
talking to Juri as she sang, a voice reaching all four corners of the 
bar.

&quot;I am human and I need to be loved,

Just like everybody else does...,&quot;

Up at the bar Haruka Tenoh leaned up against the bar, her lover Michiru 
standing beside her. &quot;So what do you think of her?&quot; the sandy haired 
woman asked.

&quot;It&#39;s always a bit odd to meet other versions of me,&quot; Arisugawa Juri 
conceded. She looked elegant in her dress, her long orange hair 
carefully styled. She was fully in her hostess mode, having already gone 
around to greet any new arrivals.

&quot;All those what might have beens,&quot; Michiru commented softly, her aqua 
green hair framing her beautiful face, &quot;or never could have been.&quot; She 
looked over at Juri curiously and asked, &quot;Have you and she talked yet?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Juri shook her head, &quot;I find it gets to be a bit too confusing, 
honestly. I sent May over to say hello, she handled it fine.&quot;

&quot;Chicken,&quot; Haruka laughed.

Juri promptly agreed, &quot;Exactly.&quot; She took a drink of her colored 
ginger-ale and sighed, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to get home and see Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;Baby-sitting Chibi-Usa again,&quot; Michiru sighed. She looked at Juri 
thoughtfully, &quot;You know, we could just leave Chibi-Usa and Hotaru 
together.&quot;

&quot;Remember the mess from the last time we did that?&quot; Haruka reminded her.

Michiru sighed, &quot;Good point.&quot;

Mahoro wiped the counter off briskly, the black haired former combat 
android smiling cheerfully. &quot;You see the new Tuxedo Kamen?&quot; she asked 
them cheerfully.

&quot;How did Tuxie get in here?&quot; Haruka looked surprised.

&quot;I&#39;d better find out.&quot; Juri looked up to track the tuxedo clad figure 
who was accompanying Sailor Moon through the busy crowd. &quot;How did Bones 
let him through?&quot; she muttered before Juri excused herself to head over 
to the couple.

Gallantly Tuxedo Kamen sheltered Sailor Moon from the crowd and she 
smiled up gratefully, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Juri decided to start things off 
pleasantly and see how it went, &quot;I&#39;m the owner, Arisugawa Juri.&quot;

Tuxedo Kamen turned to look at her and Juri blinked in surprise. Beneath 
the long cape the suit was the same, but cut to hug the clearly feminine 
form beneath it. She reached up to remove the mask and Rei Hino smiled 
at her, &quot;It&#39;s good to meet you, Ms. Arisugawa.&quot;

Sailor Moon beamed, &quot;This is a terrific place.&quot;

Juri tried not to let her surprise show on her face, especially at how 
well Rei filled out the Tuxedo Kamen suit. &quot;Well, I hope you have fun,&quot; 
she managed.

&quot;You know the other Rei, right?&quot; Rei smiled wryly, &quot;I met her a little 
while ago.&quot;

Juri chuckled, &quot;She&#39;s a friend of mine, yes.&quot;

&quot;I like my Rei better,&quot; Sailor Moon confided, snuggling closer to her 
tuxedo clad lover.

Rei blushed faintly but she looked proud, too. &quot;I think we&#39;ll go grab a 
drink,&quot; and with that they left Juri behind.

&quot;You know,&quot; Juri murmured thoughtfully as they walked away, &quot;Rei really 
does fill out that suit pretty well.&quot;

To be continued....

The Staff: The bar&#146;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Mahoro is from the series Mahoromantic. Keiko is also from Utena. 
Cyberdoll May is from Hand Maid May. And finally Bones is from

Our Cast This Episode: Juri is from Revolutionary Girl Utena, Dorothy is 
from Gundam Wing, Duo is from Gundam Wing, Kanoe is from X-1999 and 
Cathy is an original character of Alithea&#39;s. Tuxedo Kamen and Sailor 
Moon are from Sailor Moon: Altered Destinies. And finally Haruka and 
Michiru are also from Sailor Moon.

Author&#39;s Notes: I&#39;ve been reading Alithea&#39;s &#39;Heart of Dust&#39; for awhile 
now so when she suggested that they appear in a Arisugawa episode I 
said, &quot;Sure!&quot; A mega-crossover like some of my own fics it&#39;s almost as 
entertaining to see who&#39;ll show up next as to see how the romances are 
going. Kanoe sang a bit from the song &quot;How soon is now&quot; by the Smiths.</pre>
