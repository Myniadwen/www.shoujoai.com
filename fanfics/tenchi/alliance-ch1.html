<h1>Alliance (part 1 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rann.html">Rann Aridorn</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Comments: This is an AU Tenchi Muyo series. It&#39;s also the first series 
that actually takes the meaning of that name into account, heheheheh. 
&quot;No Need for Tenchi&quot;? Well, hell, if there&#39;s no need for him, why the 
hell is he in there? My answer... he ain&#39;t. ^_^ So, no Tenchi in this 
universe, and you probably won&#39;t even see a single male for at least 
four parts. So, without further ado, I bring you Tenchi Muyo: 
Alliance, Chapter One.

------------------------------------------------------------

It was a time of great peril for the Jurai Empire. Their star-spanning 
influence was beginning to wane, collapsing under its own farspread 
weight and a lack of certain essential resources. Advisors have 
informed the Emperor that the Empire will fall in a matter of decades 
if alliances are not made and new resources found.

So it is that the Juraian Emperor has sent his wives, Misaki and 
Funaho, and his daughters Ayeka and Sasami, on a diplomatic mission to 
the Hyurodan Alliance, a grouping of allied systems on the border of 
Juraian space. The Emperor has confided in his wives that they must 
secure the Hyurodan&#39;s full cooperation at any cost, for if they do 
not, the Empire may very well be doomed...

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;How dull,&quot; the Princess Ayeka sighed heavily, gazing boredly out at 
the starscape sliding past the huge viewport that didn&#39;t even seem to 
be there, merely an opening into the vast, cold expanse of space. She 
sat straight and tall, of course, for a Juraian Princess would never 
slouch or slump, no matter how bored she was. Her lady-in-waiting was 
brushing her long purple hair, which had been taken out of its 
customary twin ponytails for that purpose. &quot;Going to meet yet another 
race for yet more long negotiations.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps it won&#39;t be dull this time, my lady,&quot; her servant replied in 
a light tone. &quot;I&#39;ve heard interesting things about the Hyurodan.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ayeka&#39;s tone gave away her interest, though it was improper for 
a princess to listen to gossip and tall tales. However, it was 
perfectly acceptable to gather new information from reliable sources. 
The princess turned interested pink eyes toward her attendant. &quot;And 
what have you heard, Kiyone?&quot;

The green-haired woman leaned back slightly, seeming to consider. Both 
women were attired in Juraian kimonos, though Kiyone&#39;s was a very 
simple white affair, and Ayeka&#39;s was a more elaborate one with a high 
neck and an intricate manner of being tied, and resplendant in royal 
purple and rose.

&quot;Quite a lot, actually, my lady. For one thing, they&#39;re often called 
&#39;cat people&#39;, because many of them have yellow, slit-pupiled eyes and 
sharp teeth, and some even have tails!&quot;

Ayeka lifted one sculpted purple eyebrow. &quot;Tails, you say? Well, they 
wouldn&#39;t be the only species, but it sounds a little odd.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not all, my lady.&quot; Kiyone&#39;s indigo eyes were glittering now, 
obviously rather enthused with the subject. &quot;It&#39;s said that many of 
them are very powerful, able to lift amazing amounts, fly, and throw 
beams of energy. They&#39;re also able to utilize any sort of crystallized 
energy, and I&#39;ve heard that some can even teleport!&quot;

&quot;Utilize any sort of crystallized energy?&quot; Ayeka seemed to be becoming 
interested at last, leaning forward a little. &quot;If what you say is 
true, then they could indeed be valuable allies to the Empire. Do you 
know anything about the royal family we&#39;re going to meet with?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s said that they used to be space pirates, and that even the 
youngest daughter is over 2,000 years old, though I think, compared to 
Juraians, that would make her about your age, my lady.&quot;

&quot;My age?&quot; Ayeka replied, looking a little offended, putting one hand 
to her chest. &quot;But I am barely 800! And space pirates don&#39;t sound like 
the sort of people we should be associating with at all.&quot;

&quot;Well, apparently, my lady, the royal family of the Hyurodan banded 
all their peoples&#39; worlds together to repell an invasion about 200 
years ago, and ever since then, they&#39;ve settled down to be respectable 
rulers. ... Respectable for Hyurodan, anyway.&quot;

Ayeka opened her mouth to reply, only to be interrupted by a great 
crashing sound from the main room of her quarters, followed by a loud, 
rather unmistakable yelp. The princess&#39;s eye twitched in what she 
feared was becoming a nervous tick, and waved a hand at Kiyone to 
indicate that she should refasten her ponytails quickly. In the time 
that took, there were several more crashes and yelps, as well as 
another, younger voice trying to call out warnings and advice. The 
minute her ponytails were finished, Ayeka shot to her feet and strode 
to the large double doors, flinging them open with a resounding boom, 
like thunder from atop the mountain.

&quot;MIIIIIIIIIIIHOOOOOOOOOOSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!&quot;

The dark-skinned servant looked up from the floor where she lay amidst 
uncountable shards of pottery and statuary, tears gathered in her 
baby-blue eyes and blonde hair in disarray. She had also somehow 
managed to get the belt of her white kimono entangled in one of the 
display pedestals, making it sway and bump around every time she 
moved, no doubt the cause of the numerous other crashes. Ayeka&#39;s 
little sister, Sasami, stood nearby, gazing at her elder sister 
sheepishly.

&quot;Heheh... sorry, Ayeka,&quot; the young girl murmured, lowering her head, 
long, arcing blue ponytails drooping like a chastised puppy&#39;s ears.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Princess Ayeka,&quot; sniffled Mihoshi, looking ready to 
burst into a flood of tears at any moment.

At the dual display of cuteness, Ayeka found her fury fast ebbing, 
against her wishes. Her eye twitched several more times, before she 
simply turned her head away and attempted to compose herself. &quot;Kiyone, 
help Mihoshi to right herself. And please try to keep her from 
destroying any more priceless works of art today.&quot;

&quot;Hai, my lady,&quot; Kiyone replied quickly, giving an equally quick bow to 
hide her bemused expression, before moving to help her coworker 
unentangle herself.

Ayeka, trying to regain some of her good nature, tucked her hands 
inside her sleeves and moved carefully around the shards of ceramic 
and stone, to stand in front of her sister and smile down at her. 
&quot;Well, Sasami, are you ready to meet the Hyurodan royal family?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh!&quot; the girl piped, her own smile returning readily as she 
bobbed her head. &quot;Mihoshi&#39;s been telling me all sorts of great 
stories, about how the Hyurodan can lift entire cities above their 
heads and steal planets away in the night without anyone noticing and 
how they all have fur and purr if you scratch them behind the ears!&quot;

&quot;... She has, has she?&quot; Ayeka murmured, turning a rather acidic look 
in the direction of the ladies-in-waiting. Mihoshi was retying her 
kimono and remained oblivious, while Kiyone merely returned a sheepish 
&#39;I&#39;m not her keeper&#39; look. &quot;I&#39;m sure such tales are exaggerated 
somewhat, Sasami.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and she said a whole lot about their tails!&quot;

The elder princess heaved a silent sigh. They were almost to the 
Hyurodan homeworld, and it was STILL going to be a very long trip.

------------------------------------------------------------

The princesses, their attendants following at a respectful distance, 
crossed the great arboretum that occupied the midline of the ship, 
coming to stand beside their mother and her co-wife. All four Juraian 
women were dressed in the more full, ceremonial versions of their 
traditional kimonos, layers upon layers of exotic, otherworldy cloth 
defining each of their status and roles in fine detail for anyone that 
knew how to read them.

&quot;You two look wonderful!&quot; Misaki cried, her eyes sparkling, obviously 
dearly longing to sieze her daughters up in a hug that would surely 
lift them both off their feet, and barely being restrained from doing 
so by Funaho lightly placing two fingers on the back of the other 
woman&#39;s hand, a subtle, but physical reminder that there was a time 
and place for everything.

&quot;Thank you, mother,&quot; Ayeka replied, smiling and fighting the urge to 
let her eye twitch again. She sometimes had occassion to wonder if her 
sister&#39;s servant was not Misaki&#39;s secret firstborn, as the two were 
sometimes so alike it was uncanny. After a moment, Ayeka turned her 
gaze to the world they were fast approaching, most of it shrouded in 
clouds and dappled blue. &quot;Will we be landing soon?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Funaho replied, moving to stand slightly ahead of the rest of 
them. Ayeka smiled slightly at her co-mother&#39;s back; in many ways, she 
felt closer to the woman than her own mother, finding the brown-haired 
Empress&#39; calm demeanor a worthy goal to emulate. &quot;We shall soon be 
meeting with the Queen and Princess of the Hyurodan.&quot;

&quot;Is their king busy with trade route discussions, too?&quot; Sasami piped 
up curiously, her thoughts apparently on her father.

Funaho smiled softly, turning and laying a hand lightly on Sasami&#39;s 
head. &quot;No, Sasami, there is no King of the Hyurodan. The entire 
Hyurodan race is female.&quot;

&quot;Wow, all of them?&quot; Sasami asked, her bright pink eyes widening.

&quot;All of them?&quot; Ayeka parroted, her own eyes showing a good deal of the 
whites around them.

Misaki giggled in the background, Funaho tossing an indulgent smile in 
the other Empress&#39; direction, before turning back to the princesses 
and their equally amazed attendants. &quot;Yes. There are no male Hyurodan. 
They also have shown no desire to come forward and explain how this is 
so, so I will expect you both to contain your curiosity indefinitely, 
as it might offend them.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Ayeka replied, having regained her composure.

&quot;Okay!&quot; chirped Sasami.

&quot;Good. Now, the Hyurodan royal family is also not quite so...&quot; Funaho 
paused seeming to search for a fitting adjective.

&quot;Proper?&quot; Misaki offered, bending down to fuss with Sasami&#39;s 
ponytails, despite them needing no fussing with whatsoever.

&quot;Mmm, I was trying to find something a little more complimentary. 
Perhaps it&#39;s better to say that they&#39;re somewhat less restrained in 
their actions and mannerisms than either of you may be used to.&quot;

&quot;I am a Princess of Jurai, and my composure shall not flag for an 
instant. I shall comport myself in a manner that shall do honor to the 
Empire during these negotiations,&quot; Ayeka replied immediately, tones 
level, chin lifted slightly with pride.

&quot;What she said!&quot; Sasami replied, voice laced with giggles since her 
mother was sneaking in a few tickles.

Funaho delivered an exceedingly light slap to the back of one of 
Misaki&#39;s hands, and the other Empress pouted momentarily before moving 
back to her position in the procession. After a few moments, the 
familiar brilliance of atmospheric entry began to wash over the 
viewport, dimmed somewhat so that the bright white and red flames 
wouldn&#39;t damage anyone&#39;s eyes.

They landed in what seemed to Ayeka to be a rather small city near a 
rather small castle, though she granted that she was used to the 
absolutely vast capital city and palace of Jurai. The escort that came 
to meet them was composed, as they had been told to expect, entirely 
of women. As Kiyone had said, Ayeka noticed one or two with rather 
yellowish eyes, though she thought they were closer to a shade of 
green, and didn&#39;t have slit pupils. None of them had tails. But they 
all had somewhat longer, more squared-off ears than any of the 
Juraians, and their hair seemed to spike back strangely.

Ayeka was also not prepared for the processional guard was wearing, 
and had to fight to keep from being rather scandalized. Each woman 
(all of them exceedingly good-looking) was wearing a golden 
breastplate that went over the shoulders and back and left the midriff 
bare, and a thick golden belt that ran just under each woman&#39;s navel, 
attached to which was a very long white loincloth embroidered with 
yellow designs in elaborate Galactic Standard that read simply &quot;Royal 
Guard&quot;. Save for golden gauntlets, tall white boots, and the golden 
spears they carried, the women wore nothing else, and Ayeka thought it 
a rather inappropriate design for doing battle... or anything else.

The head guard, apparently distinguished by silver shoulder plates 
(and a navel ring, Ayeka noticed, though that caused her to flush 
across the bridge of her nose), stepped forward and bowed to the 
Juraians... providing a view down her chestplate, which Ayeka 
valiantly tried to ignore.

&quot;Greetings, Highnesses. We&#39;re honored to have you here,&quot; the head 
guard said once she had straightened up, in what had to be the 
shortest diplomatic greeting Ayeka had yet heard.

&quot;And we are equally honored to be here,&quot; Funaho replied, apparently 
deciding it was appropriate to reply in kind.

&quot;If you&#39;ll follow us, we&#39;ll take you to see Queen Washu.&quot; And, as 
simple as that, the guard turned around, showing that the loincloth&#39;s 
back strap was not any thicker than the front. She called out a 
command that wasn&#39;t in Standard, and the other guards moved to 
positions around the Juraians, making Ayeka feel uncomfortably as if 
she were a prisoner rather than a diplomat.

It was a short walk to the castle, and they were immediately shown 
into the throne room. The throne itself immediately drew one&#39;s eye, 
set against the back wall, large and obviously made out of pricey 
metals and expensive, soft material. Upon it sat who Ayeka assumed to 
be Queen Washu, a rather small Hyurodan woman with the trademark 
spikey hair and slightly yellowish green eyes that Ayeka had observed 
in the guards, though her own hair was a bright pink, and styled in 
such a manner that she rather looked like she had a crab sprouting 
from her face. She was dressed in what looked like a derivative of a 
more casual Juraian kimono, with the lower part open to reveal black 
tights hugging her legs; the design also seemed more harsh, somehow, 
as if it had been made more spikey to accomodate the Hyurodan people.

Lounging on the arm of the throne as if it were a couch was a woman 
who Ayeka could only assume to be the Queen&#39;s daughter, and she was 
indeed rather striking. Her own spiky hair was cyan, let to arch back 
in long, elegant waves, two long shanks of it falling past her ears. 
Unlike Queen Washu, she seemed to be tall and slender, like the 
guards, and very well-proportioned under what she was wearing... which 
seemed to be a much shorter, tighter version of her mother&#39;s kimono. 
Only her crossed legs prevented Ayeka from being able to see right up 
the miniskirt-style garment, and she quickly looked up when she 
realized where her gaze had wandered (the outfit seemed designed to 
make your gaze wander there, regardless of your preferences). She had 
her eyes closed and her hands behind her head, for all appearances 
napping.

&quot;Well, Empress Funaho, Empress Misaki!&quot; Queen Washu&#39;s voice seemed 
rather pleasant, somehow seeming to fit her small frame, and she 
hopped to her feet, long pink hair swaying behind her. &quot;And the 
Princesses Ayeka and Sasami. The Emperor has favored me with his 
entire family, it seems like!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet with you, Queen Washu,&quot; Funaho 
replied, bowing. &quot;I bring you greetings and goodwill from my husband 
and my people, in the hopes that we might have long and pleasant 
relations between us.&quot;

Washu smiled at that, and Ayeka thought it almost... predatory. After 
a moment, the slight woman waved a hand, and the guards knocked the 
ends of their spears against the ground once before turning to depart. 
The elder Princess looked straight at the Hyurodan Queen and not at 
her servants, as was appropriate, but jumped slightly and looked over 
her shoulder at a pair of surprised exclamations from behind her. She 
found the ladies-in-waiting both rubbing their rears rather ruefully, 
Kiyone blushing angrily, while Mihoshi merely looked confused, while 
some of the exiting guards snickered among themselves.

Once the guards had closed the doors behind them, the Juraians were 
alone with the Hyurodan royalty. Ayeka, feeling rather nervous, turned 
her gaze towards the Hyurodan princess, and almost gasped aloud. The 
other woman&#39;s eyes were open, and they were exactly as Kiyone had 
described, though that vague reference to a cat&#39;s eyes had not done 
them justice. They were a bright golden color, hard like amber, their 
slitted pupils seeming to strike into Ayeka&#39;s eyes like a physical 
force. The other princess smiled slowly, a lazy, tigerish smile, 
showing off one pointed fang.

&quot;My daughter, Princess Ryoko,&quot; Queen Washu spoke up, seeming amused by 
the way that Ayeka couldn&#39;t seem to look away from Ryoko&#39;s eyes, like 
a mouse hypnotized by a snake. &quot;Now, Empress Funaho, if you don&#39;t 
mind, I&#39;d like to get down to the facts. I was a scientist and worked 
for a living before I was royalty, and that suits me better than empty 
words.&quot;

&quot;Just what facts are you speaking of, Queen Washu?&quot; Funaho replied 
evenly, trying to ignore Misaki&#39;s rather distressed expression as she 
waved a hand in front of Ayeka&#39;s eyes, causing the princess to step 
back and try to subtly shoo her mother back into place.

&quot;The fact is, the Juraian Empire is tumbling down around your ears!&quot; 
Washu exclaimed, smiling as if she&#39;d just discovered gold.

Misaki winced visibly, and even Funaho looked discomfited. &quot;What are 
you talking about?!&quot; Ayeka cried, forgetting herself in her surprise 
and anger. Sasami looked back and forth from one to another, seeming 
confused, as did Mihoshi. Kiyone simply looked shocked and vaguely 
pale.

Washu smiled, as did Ryoko, both seeming to share the feeling of a 
lion circling in on a wounded prey animal. &quot;You&#39;ve built yourselves a 
pretty little house of cards with your amazing tree-ships,&quot; Washu 
continued, her hands on her hips as she gazed directly at the 
Juraians, as if she were twenty feet tall and could squash them all 
easily. &quot;And amazing they are. But you all can&#39;t survive by your trees 
alone! Nor can your trees survive indefinitely on THEIR own! Juraian 
trees rarely grow well on colony worlds, and they&#39;re running out of 
essential minerals on the homeworld! Your people are also becoming 
dependant on food sources and other imports from colony and associated 
worlds!&quot;

The diminutive ruler began walking back and forth, her gaze always 
focused predominently on Funaho, though she could see the rest of the 
progressively paler Juraians. Only Mihoshi seemed unaffected, still 
looking confused.

&quot;You can&#39;t stretch your exploration any further without taxing your 
already thin resources, and you can&#39;t demand more from colony worlds 
that are becoming so far-flung they&#39;re starting to wonder why they&#39;re 
a part of the Empire at all!&quot;

&quot;You would seem to have us at a disadvantage,&quot; Funaho replied slowly 
and evenly. &quot;Though it is hardly as dire as you make it sound.&quot;

&quot;Sister, if anything, it&#39;s worse!&quot; Washu crowed, pointing at Funaho. 
&quot;You can&#39;t pull the wool over my eyes like you have your subjects, 
I&#39;ve looked at all the data, and I know it to be true!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so theatrical, mom,&quot; Ryoko spoke up for the first time, 
languidly sitting up and stretching, and thereby gaining everyone&#39;s 
attention at once for her sudden speech. &quot;Calm down a little. Can&#39;t 
you see you&#39;re scaring the poor cute little princess?&quot; The wicked 
smile that the Hyurodan woman turned Ayeka&#39;s way assured the 
purple-haired Juraian that Ryoko was NOT talking about Sasami.

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right, Ryoko,&quot; Washu mused, moving back to her throne 
and settling in, giving her daughter a pat on the thigh. &quot;I suppose 
it&#39;s rude to make them show ALL their cards right away.&quot;

Funaho, as calm as ever, seemed at something of a loss. She let her 
eyes slide to one side, and noticed that Misaki seemed to be almost 
shaking, as was Sasami. Ayeka seemed to be more composed, but 
seemed... lost. After a moment, the brown-haired woman moved, 
whispering a few comforting words in her co-wife&#39;s ear, then gently 
guiding Sasami into her mother&#39;s embrace.

&quot;I think it is a little late for that,&quot; Funaho replied after a moment, 
voice still proud and dignified, if perhaps defeated. &quot;I would have 
appreciated it, Queen Washu, if you had not made your case in such a 
way. You have badly upset my family.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Washu replied, and after a moment, her eyes softened, 
seeming to be genuinely contrite.

&quot;The help of the Hyurodan Alliance is indeed needed, but there are 
other viable sources for the resources we need.&quot; Funaho now seemed 
mildly angry, making it quite clear that if Washu did not comport 
herself with more restraint, the offer would be gone.

&quot;Yes, but none with the amount of both natural and technological 
resources we can offer,&quot; the Hyurodan queen replied, rising to the 
challenge. 

&quot;Though we don&#39;t often care to show it to outsiders, we&#39;re a 
technologically advanced people, mostly due to my own inventions. 
What&#39;s the average Juraian lifespan, hm? 5,000? Maybe 4,000 for 
colonials and offshoot races? We could make it ten times that.&quot;

Ayeka&#39;s head swam. The Empire on the verge of collapse? The 
possibility of living to be... 50,000? The very concept of both seemed 
to be beyond the realm of comprehension, and the princess very much 
feared she would faint. She saw her mother actually wobble a little, 
only to be supported by Sasami.

&quot;We&#39;ve got technology that would allow you to harness crystallized 
energy in vastly more efficient ways, not to MENTION all the genetic 
engineering techniques we have!&quot; Washu leaned back, looking smug, and 
continued. &quot;Let&#39;s not quibble, what I want is pretty simple. I want to 
be united with the Empire as a full equal.&quot;

Ayeka flushed in anger and amazement. A paltry little grouping of 
systems would DARE to hold itself equal to the mighty Juraian empire? 
Her attitude deflated somewhat as she remembered what she&#39;d just been 
told. The Juraian empire might not be mighty for much longer, without 
help.

&quot;I think that can be easily accomplished,&quot; Funaho allowed, seeming 
relieved.

&quot;Goooood. The thing is, I want to make SURE of it. It&#39;s really only 
one small demand, really a sort of proof that the Hyurodan Alliance&#39;s 
interests will always be represented in the Empire.&quot;

&quot;... And that would be?&quot;

Washu leaned forward, smiling like some satyr out of mythology. &quot;I 
want my daughter Ryoko to marry your eldest, Ayeka.&quot;

&quot;W-WHAT?!&quot; Ayeka cried, choking on the word, diplomacy forgotten for a 
moment. Desperate to calm her, both Misaki and Kiyone moved in close, 
ready to physically restrain her if possible.

&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; Washu chirped, while Ryoko merely sat on the arm of 
the throne and looked vastly amused. &quot;An infusion of new blood can 
only do good things for the royal family anyway! And if my daughter 
someday shares the throne with yours, I can be assured that my people 
will always be done right for by the Empire!&quot;

Funaho looked aside, at where Ayeka was standing, red-faced, seeming 
caught between shock and indignation, flanked by her mother and her 
lady-in-waiting, both of whom were trying their best to placate her. 
She resisted the urge to bite her bottom lip at the difficulty of the 
situation. Funaho loved Ayeka as dearly as if the girl were her own, 
and she almost was, having been raised by both mothers as much as one 
or the other. She also knew that the princess was haughty, her pride 
and exuberance not yet having been tempered by wisdom or experience. 
Definitely a lack of experience.

But Washu&#39;s proposition, in all honesty, was a fair one. It had been 
many generations since a Juraian royal family member had married 
outside the species, but it was certainly not unheard of, especially 
in forming political alliances. Funaho knew that Ayeka would be very 
angry with her if she made this decision for her... perhaps even hate 
her. But the Empress knew, just as Ayeka would learn, that the will of 
an individual, be it commoner or Princess, must sometimes be 
sacrificed for the betterment of billions.

&quot;... We will have to discuss details,&quot; Funaho spoke up after long 
minutes. &quot;But unless you have unreasonable expectations of our coming 
alliance, then let it be so. Princess Ayeka will wed Princess Ryoko.&quot;

Ayeka&#39;s mouth fell open. She looked to Funaho, her gaze holding a deep 
wound of surprise and hurt. After a moment, the Empress looked away, 
unable to meet the Princess&#39; eyes. Ayeka looked to her mother for 
support, only to see Misaki giving her a rather shaky smile, as if to 
say &#39;You must accept it, try to be happy.&#39; Faltering, she looked to 
her sister, who was simply staring at her, as was Kiyone, though the 
servant girl seemed pale, as she had before, as if she were going to 
be ill. Finally, almost afraid, Ayeka turned her head towards the 
smirking Ryoko.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, cupcake,&quot; the Hyurodan princess purred, almost 
licking her lips. &quot;I&#39;ll be gentle the first time or two.&quot;

&quot;Oh wow, a royal wedding!&quot; Mihoshi burst out, apparently unable to 
contain her excitement any more. &quot;It&#39;ll be so amazing! So many people 
will come, and there&#39;ll be parties and celebration and-&quot; The blonde 
woman blinked, her excited banter trailing off as she saw Kiyone sag 
slightly. &quot;Ano... Kiyone, why did Princess Ayeka faint?&quot;</pre>
