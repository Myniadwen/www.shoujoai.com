<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 6 of 16)</h1>

<a href="../tenchi/onceagain-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The meeting up at the shinto shrine was quiet, the
talk hesitant before Rei Hino finally took charge.
&quot;This isn&#39;t a wake everyone,&quot; the black haired woman
said to them firmly, &quot;hell, we aren&#39;t even going that
far away.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but this is the first time one of us has
left,&quot; Makoto Kino said wryly, the tall brown haired
woman sitting by the table that was loaded with food
and snacks she had cooked, &quot;it&#39;s going to take some
time to adjust.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ami Mizuno said faintly, the blue haired
woman sitting beside Rei, &quot;if I hadn&#39;t been accepted
in Tokyo University this never would have happened.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize, Ami,&quot; Usagi Tsukino said with a
smile, the blonde wiping at teary eyes, &quot;we&#39;re all
happy for you.&quot;

&quot;And if anyone here deserves to go to Tokyo U, it&#39;s
you,&quot; Minako Aino said, the blonde bombshell reaching
out to squeeze Ami&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Rei said after a moment, &quot;we&#39;ll keep in
touch. Ami and I have email, there&#39;s phones, and if
there&#39;s an emergency we&#39;ll come running.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami nodded, &quot;Tokyo U is important to me, but
not more important than all of you.&quot;

Usagi reached out to squeeze both their hands, &quot;Thank
you.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Makoto asked after a moment, &quot;what&#39;s this place
you&#39;re staying at?&quot;

&quot;The Hinata Dorms and Inn,&quot; Rei answered promptly,
&quot;it&#39;s a combination of dorm in the main building an a
inn using new building added to the property. It was
also a hotspring resort at one time, so we&#39;ll have
access to that, too.&quot;

&quot;And you two are planning to share a room there?&quot;
Minako asked impishly.

Ami blushed faintly as she answered, &quot;Yes. The
manager, Kanako Urashima, seems to have no problem
with it.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Usagi blurted, &quot;I wonder if that means
she&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;Usagi,&quot; Rei gave her a look, &quot;we&#39;ve barely met her,
meatball head.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so mean,&quot; Usagi&#39;s eyes welled with tears.

Ami had to fight back a laugh, watching her friends
falling back on their familiar patterns of behavior, a
comforting thing knowing that they&#39;d all be parted
soon enough. Makoto busied herself with setting up
more of the food, Minako casually flipped through a
few of Rei&#39;s manga and Usagi and Rei argued
affectionately.

&quot;So how are your mother and Rei&#39;s grandfather taking
news of your relationship?&quot; Makoto asked softly after
a few moments.

&quot;Grandfather&#39;s taken it very well,&quot; Ami answered
promptly, &quot;he seems to be content if Rei&#39;s happy.&quot; A
frown, &quot;My mother on the other hand....&quot;

&quot;Not good?&quot; Makoto asked sympathetically.

Ami smiled wryly as she sighed, &quot;I&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll
respond to an email once I&#39;m away from home for
awhile.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll come around,&quot; Makoto said firmly, &quot;you&#39;re her
only daughter, after all.&quot;

&quot;And grandfather is working on her, too,&quot; Rei noted
before adding, &quot;though I can&#39;t quite decided if that&#39;s
a good thing or not.&quot;

Everyone laughed at that.

Some weeks later and I another city Ami hummed to
herself softly as she finished unpacking her clothes
from the bags on the low table. &quot;Your turn Rei,&quot; she
called to her, &quot;and do you mind if I do the email?&quot;

Rei smiled from where she had finished setting up
their household shrine. &quot;No problem,&quot; she lugged her
bag over, &quot;I&#39;m sure Usagi and the others are dying of
curiosity at this point.&quot;

Setting up her laptop Ami sat by the window, her
expression thoughtful as she tried to organize the
impressions of the last few days. Opening up her email
account she typed in the address
&quot;bunny@crystaltokyo.jpn&quot; then began to write.

To Usagi, Makoto, Minako, Haruka, Michiru, Setsuna and
Hotaru.

We&#39;ve been at Hinata Inn for a day or so, and already
we feel surprisingly at home. I think that Makoto was
feeling a bit worried that a self-described medical
nerd and a shinto priestess might not fit in well, but
we blend in quite well with the unusual characters
here. What follows are my initial impressions of
them...

Motoko Aoyama is a tall young woman, rivaling Makoto,
and she almost looks like she wandered out of a
samurai drama with her archaic clothes. The black
haired woman carries a sword and is remarkably
skilled, I suspect she could even match Tuxedo Kamen.
Yet she is pleasant and almost serene, though I
suspect a temper lurks beneath that.

Ema Maeda and I may have a great deal in common, if
the laptop she was carrying with her is ant
indication. The brown haired girl appears quite shy,
too, much like I was when I first met Usagi. The other
residents here look out for her like a little sister,
apparently.

Mitsune Konno has the nickname Kitsune, and from what
I&#39;ve seen calling her a trickster fits. She reminds me
of Haruka in her looks as well as sharing Haruka&#39;s
occasionally impish nature, and Kitsune appears to be
quite reckless. Still, she runs a successful cafe and
employs two of the residents here, so she can&#39;t be all
that wild.

Anthy Himemiya is a harder one to read on several
levels. The dusky skinned, violet haired girl stands
slightly apart from the others, but there is a
gentleness about her too. Oddly she flings roses much
like Tuxedo Kamen, a gift I&#39;m determined to ask her
about. Rei has mentioned she feels power around Anthy,
but not a dark force.

Su Koalla is the most energetic girl that I&#39;ve met,
rivaling even a sugar-filled Chibi-Usa, and she seems
to be a technical genius if all the inventions I&#39;ve
seen around her are any indication. The dusky skinned
blonde teen has been quite friendly, though she asked
us some remarkably blunt questions about Rei and I.

Rei read that bit over her shoulder and chuckled. &quot;I
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you blush like that in a while,&quot;
she purred into Ami&#39;s ear.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Ami blushed faintly as she continued.

Kanako Urashima and Hotaru must both shop at the same
stores, since the young lady has, so far, worn only a
variety of black outfits. She&#39;s remarkably deadpan,
calmly accepting details of my and Rei&#39;s relationship
without a flicker in her expression. Still, I get the
sense that there&#39;s amusement and compassion beneath
her calm gaze.

Shinobu Maehara is the &#39;mother&#39; of the inn, despite
her relative youth. She cooks and cleans like a
wizard, and the taste of her food rivals Makoto&#39;s.
She, like many of the residents here, is a sophomore
student at Tokyo U ad I hope to receive guidance from
her.

&quot;She sure doesn&#39;t look it, does she?&quot; Rei remarked.
&quot;Still, I think you&#39;d be asking the graduate student
instead.&quot;

&quot;Just getting to her,&quot; Ami agreed.

I only met Mutsumi Otohime a short while before she
went over to her job at the Cafe Hinata next door, but
she comes across as remarkably easy going.

&quot;Not to mention having enormous melons,&quot; Rei
commented.

She&#39;s quite statuesque, but seems largely unaware of
her physical beauty. Her oddest habit seems to be
kissing people when she&#39;s happy... she laid a good one
on both Rei and I and no one else here seemed to bat
an eye.

In conclusion it looks like we&#39;ll fit in here quite
well, and we&#39;re settling in nicely. We miss you and
home, and look forward to your next visit.

Love, Ami and Rei.

Rei read it over completely, hugging Ami from behind
as she did so. &quot;You didn&#39;t mention that ghost busting
thing,&quot; she noted, &quot;or that Kitsune wants to hire me
for it.&quot;

&quot;I think we&#39;ll save that for the next letter,&quot; Ami
laughed. She turned, cuddling into Rei&#39;s arms, &quot;you
know, you haven&#39;t kissed me since we got here.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;d better fix that right now,&quot; Rei murmured
before kissing her.

In another room Su reached out, turning off the
monitor that she had been using to spy on them. She
knew the others had forbidden her to do this, but she
just couldn&#39;t resist... &quot;Still,&quot; Su murmured, &quot;I
wasn&#39;t expecting them to really be lovers.&quot;

To be continued....

Notes: Ami, Rei and their friends are all from Sailor
Moon, and this story also ties in with my ficcy &quot;Ice
on Fire.&quot; Anthy is from Revolutionary Girl Utena and
this series of stories is set before &quot;Echoes of a
final Duel.&quot;</pre>
