<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 16 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a>

<a href="../tenchi/locket-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Christmas Eve at the Locket: Part Two

The group forged towards the nearby dining tables, when Sakura saw 
something odd about a couple that was dancing over in the corner. 
Excusing herself for a moment, she crept up behind the two of them and 
gently tapped one of them on the shoulder.

The Dark turned, looking over at Sakura in honest surprise. The Light 
peered over the Dark&#39;s shoulder, looking kind of startled as well. 
&quot;Mistress Sakura,&quot; the Dark said, and then she asked, &quot;what are you 
doing here?&quot;

&quot;I was about to ask you the same question,&quot; Sakura said dryly, 
continuing, &quot;How did you get out of the Book of Clow, anyway?&quot;

&quot;You are our Mistress,&quot; Light explained, &quot;but that does not prevent us 
from leaving for short periods of time.&quot;

&quot;Let us finish our dance,&quot; Dark said, gently stroking at the Light&#39;s 
cheek, &quot;and we will happily return to our place in the Book.&quot;

Sakura smiled at them both, &quot;Promise me you won&#39;t cause any trouble, 
and you can keep dancing all night, OK?&quot;

&quot;No trouble,&quot; the Light said with a nod, still swaying gently to the 
music in the Dark&#39;s arms. The Dark nodded as well, and Sakura decided 
that it would have to do.

Sakura turned to go to the table, when she saw Tomoyo standing there 
with her video camera. &quot;Just like old times,&quot; Tomoyo said with a grin.

Sakura sweatdropped, took Tomoyo&#39;s hand, and headed to the table.

&quot;So, four Christmas dinner specials, and you&#39;d like to book an 
upstairs room for two later on tonight? No problem!&quot; Excel said, 
sounding very hyperactive, but kind of cute, too. She bounded off with 
their orders.

&quot;Thanks, Excel,&quot; Kaho called out after her. She noticed Sakura and 
Tomoyo standing by the table, Sakura looking confused while Tomoyo was 
giving them a knowing smirk.

Sonomi blushed faintly. &quot;We ordered dinner for you two,&quot; she said 
quickly.

&quot;Why does a club like this rent out rooms for the night?&quot; Sakura asked 
them curiously. The other three blushed, while searching for the words 
to explain. A faint blush began to appear on Sakura&#39;s face, as she 
finally got the idea. &quot;Never mind,&quot; she muttered, blushing brighter.

&quot;Sit down for dinner,&quot; Kaho invited, blushing a bit herself.

Another young woman appeared, rising up from the floor like someone 
coming back from the dead. &quot;Your dinners,&quot; Hyatt said, dropping off 
the plates with a weak smile. She went green, and fell right over.

A wide eyed Sakura watched her slither away through the bustling 
crowd. &quot;Is she all right?&quot; she asked them worriedly.

&quot;She&#39;s like that all the time,&quot; Sonomi said calmly, digging into her 
dinner.

Tomoyo raised her glass, her eyes twinkling as she looked at Sakura. 
&quot;To life,&quot; she toasted softly, wondering if she would remember the 
cue.

Sakura smiled, tapping her glass gently against Tomoyo&#39;s &quot;To love.&quot; 
They smiled at each other, lost in each other&#39;s eyes.

They both drank, then Sakura smiled softly, rising to give Tomoyo her 
hand. &quot;Would you like to dance?&quot; she invited her.

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Tomoyo answered with a smile.

Kaho and Sonomi watched the two leave hand in hand. &quot;Isn&#39;t love 
grand?&quot; Kaho said with a little sigh. Sonomi surprised her, getting 
out of her seat to kneel by her side.

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Sonomi said, taking Kaho&#39;s hand. She took a deep breath, 
and smiled at her wryly, &quot;I was planning to do this after the party.&quot; 
She puled a little box out of her pocket, &quot;I love you, Kaho, and I 
want you to stay a part of my life.&quot; The box opened, and a diamond 
ring gleams inside, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;

The bar is nearly silent as everyone hangs on Kaho&#39;s answer. Tears 
streak her face as she wraps her arms around Sonomi, &quot;Yes!&quot;

Cheers rang out around the bar at that answer. Minagi appeared by 
their table, carrying champagne and glasses, &quot;Congratulations!&quot;

&quot;Way to go, mom,&quot; Tomoyo whispered, a few tears in her eyes.

Juri made her way over through the mob of well wishers to offer her 
own congratulations, and noticed Tomoyo and Sakura dancing while they 
kissed under the mistletoe. &#39;I hope things work out for them,&#39; she 
thought with a smile.

Rei and Ami gave her a wave, and Juri cursed not noticing them before 
now. She scanned the crowd, seeing Haruna and Makoto together by the 
bar, and Minako and Natsuna eating together. &#39;So where is she?&#39; she 
wondered.

Setsuna stood near the library, looking as elegant and reserved as 
ever. Juri sighed softly in relief, and began to make her way over. As 
she neared, she noticed the stylish clothes and casual stance, the 
dark eyes focused down on the book she held.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Juri said to her, her expression serious.

&quot;For what?&quot; Setsuna asked, looking up at Juri coolly.

&quot;I reacted very badly,&quot; Juri admitted, &quot;when I found out that Hotaru 
was your daughter. I&#39;m very sorry for my rudeness.&quot;

Juri felt Setsuna&#39;s gaze, almost like the truth of her words were 
being weighed in those dark eyes. Finally, she gave her a gentle smile 
and, &quot;Apology accepted.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri smiled. They both stood there a moment, the noise of 
the party washing over their island of quiet.

&quot;Have you known Haruka and Michiru long?&quot; Setsuna asked Juri 
curiously.

&quot;I met them a few years ago,&quot; Juri smiled, &quot;at a fencing tournament. 
Haruka was the only one to give me a real fight.&quot; The last bit was 
said quite casually, no boasting involved. Just a simple statement of 
fact.

&quot;Did Haruka take loosing well?&quot; Setsuna asked, a little smile on her 
face.

A soft laugh, and Juri said, &quot;About as well as I do, I think. She 
immediately asked me to show her the move I used to disarm her, which 
I did. After that, she introduced me to Michiru and we all went to get 
some coffee.&quot;

Setsuna nodded thoughtfully. There was something about Juri, she 
noticed, that could be quite engaging. She could easily see her 
quickly becoming friends with someone, but she suspected it was harder 
to get under her skin.

A slower song came on, and Juri decided to seize the moment. &quot;Dance 
with me?&quot; she asked Setsuna, offering her hand.

Setsuna hesitated a moment, then took it. &quot;One time,&quot; she smiled, and 
the two stepped out on the dance floor together.

Saya, Miyu, and Himiko stood in a dark corner together, Himiko 
carefully keeping herself between the two vampires. She didn&#39;t think 
Saya would start something with Miyu tonight, but she wasn&#39;t taking 
any chances, either.

&quot;I&#39;m a little surprised you are out, this time of year,&quot; Himiko 
admitted.

Miyu chuckled softly, &quot;We know all about birth, death and rebirth, 
m&#39;love.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Saya nodded, drinking some of her punch. Well, at least it 
was reddish, whatever she was drinking.

Back at the bar Videl waved her hand, &quot;Rum and eggnog, please.&quot;

Ryouko prepared the drink, depositing it in front of the black hared 
fighter. &quot;Good to see you, kid,&quot; Ryouko smiled.

&quot;Don&#39;t call me kid,&quot; Videl rolled her eyes. She sighed softly as she 
looked out at the dance floor and saw Bulma and 18 dancing together.

&quot;Why not ask her to dance?&quot; Ryouko asked sympathetically.

Videl shook her head, finished her glass, and headed off into the 
crowd. Ryouko wiped the bar off with a sad little smile, wondering if 
the kid would ever fall for someone who was actually available, other 
than Gohan.

Ryouko noticed a dark-hared woman making her way through the crowd to 
the bar. She was polite, but still had a dangerous aura about her, an 
aura that Ryouko recognized. When she reached the bar Ryouko asked her 
quietly, &quot;Major, is that you?&quot;

Major Motoko Kusanagi smiled, &quot;Recognized my ghost, huh?&quot; Ryouko 
poured her a rum and motor oil, which the cyborg smoothly slung back. 
&quot;Thanks. I just wanted to ask you to tell Juri Merry Christmas for me. 
I won&#39;t be in for a while, and I&#39;ve got to lay low for a while,&quot; she 
said quietly, carefully watching the crowd.

&quot;Are you in trouble?&quot; Ryouko asked eagerly, adding, &quot;You know we take 
care of our own.&quot;

&quot;More espionage style trouble,&quot; Motoko smiled. She chuckled at the 
idea of sicking Ryouko and friends on the Mossad, but quickly 
dismissed it. With a smile and a wave, she slipped off into the crowd.

Nabiki noticed the group at one of the tables and made her way through 
the crowd to them. She slid into the seat beside Akane before asking, 
&quot;How did she do it?&quot;

Ranma, Shampoo, and Ukyo looked rather surprised at that sudden 
question, but Akane handled it calmly. &quot;Juri took father on for the 
right to be the head of the school,&quot; she quietly said with a smile.

Nabiki looked at her in disbelief, suddenly understanding why Juri had 
been training so hard with Tenoh Haruka and the others. &quot;Did she win?&quot; 
she asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Ranma grinned, &quot;but she gave him a real run for his money. Then 
she pointed out that if a woman like her could do that to him...&quot;

&quot;I might also be acceptable,&quot; Nabiki said with a nod. &quot;Remind me not 
to get Juri angry,&quot; she said quietly. Ukyo and Shampoo got up to 
dance, smiling at each other sweetly. &quot;When did that happen?&quot; Nabiki 
asked, a bit surprised. Ranma shrugged.

There was the soft sound of a fork taping on a wineglass, and the room 
quieted down as Juri climbed up on the bar to get everyone&#39;s 
attention. &quot;First of all,&quot; she said, &quot;Merry Christmas, to anyone I 
haven&#39;t talked to yet tonight!&quot;

There was a rousing cheer from the crowd, as May, Hitomi, Excel, 
Hyatt, Ryouko, Minagi, Nabiki, Sasami and Bones all gathered by the 
bar. Hikaru, Umi and Fuu came out of the karaoke room, and the crowd 
swelled as the women left the dining tables and the dance floor to 
gather around the long bar.

&quot;We&#39;ll be closing up soon,&quot; and there was a groan of disappointment 
from the ladies. Juri smiled as she continued on, &quot;So that you can all 
hit the other parties, too!&quot; Another cheer, she continued, &quot;But I 
wanted to say a few words before you go.&quot;

Juri stopped a moment, looking around at the crowd, at all the women 
there. She thought of all the friends who were here tonight, of the 
friends that were absent. She&#39;d had a few bad Christmas times over the 
years, and the differences between then and now was immense.

&quot;I don&#39;t really have a family anymore,&quot; Juri admitted with a smile, 
&quot;and I suspect I&#39;m not alone in that around here. But over the past 
few months, I&#39;d like to think we&#39;ve been building a new family for us 
all, right here.&quot;

Juri passed her cup down to Ryouko, who filled it with a smile. Juri 
raised it in a toast, and the crowd followed, &quot;So to all of my family, 
Merry Christmas!&quot;

&quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; the crowd boomed back, and cheers rang out.

Juri climbed off the bar as the customers began to reluctantly head 
for the exits. A hand caught her arm, and Excel smiled.

&quot;Before you go, you promised to open your presents,&quot; Hyatt reminded 
Juri from right beside her.

&quot;Right,&quot; Juri smiled and nodded. They all tried to finish closing up 
pretty quickly, and then Juri stood at the bar with her pile of gifts.

Nabiki smiled, taking the first gift from the counter and passing it 
to Juri. She unwrapped it, placing the mug gently in Juri&#39;s hand, not 
disturbing the gold chain wrapped around it. Juri drew the chain out, 
revealing a necklace with a gold and diamond sword hanging from it.

&quot;Wow,&quot; seemed to be the general response to that. Juri&#39;s eyes met 
Nabiki&#39;s, and they exchanged a small nod.

She picked up another gift, and was surprised when Ryouko spoke up, 
&quot;Open that last, OK? It&#39;ll take some explaining.&quot; Juri raised an 
eyebrow, but put it down.

Keiko&#39;s gift was next in the pile, so Juri chose that. She gasped 
softly, drawing out the fencing suit reverently. Pure white, it had 
Juri&#39;s name running down one leg, as well as stitched on the shoulder. 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri grinned.

May&#39;s package seemed a natural to pick next, and she had to smile when 
she saw it. A pack of twenty coupons, each one redeemable for May to 
clean Juri&#39;s apartment for her.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen bachelor apartments,&quot; May smiled, &quot;so I suspect those will 
come in handy.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that bad,&quot; Juri blushed, but decided not to argue too hard.

&quot;Open mine next,&quot; Sasami smiled. Juri took the wrapped off and grinned 
at the label Sasami had put on underneath it: Bachelor Survival Kit. 
She opened that box, revealing several packs of Ramen noodles, gift 
certificates to a Laundromat, and a book titled &quot;Cooking for Dummies.&quot;

&quot;You and May got together on this, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Juri chuckled, shaking 
her head.

Hyatt&#39;s gift was next, a T-shirt reading boldly, &quot;She who must be 
obeyed!&quot;

Juri unwrapped Excel&#39;s package, and stopped cold. A large, framed 
photograph of all the staff dressed in their Halloween costumes, with 
Juri front and center in her red leather &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; outfit.

Hitomi&#39;s package opened easily, but Juri wondered at what it was. The 
large red stone was as big as her fist, and the light within it pulsed 
like a living heart. &quot;It&#39;s a Drag Energist,&quot; Hitomi explained to her, 
&quot;Millerna and Merle helped me get it. If you ever want a vacation, 
hold it above your head and concentrate, and you&#39;ll be sent to Gaea.&quot; 
She smiled suddenly, &quot;I can guarantee you won&#39;t be bored.&quot;

Bones simply walked up, and in a smooth gesture pulled her long 
leather jacket right off. &quot;But, I can&#39;t,&quot; Juri started to protest, but 
Bones shushed her.

&quot;I have a closet full at home,&quot; Bones shrugged. Juri slid the coat on, 
it reached her boot tops, making her look dark and mysterious. &quot;Very 
nice,&quot; Bones nodded with a smile.

Juri looked over at Ryouko, who nodded. As Juri unwrapped the last 
gift, she noticed it was from Minagi as well. Juri turned what looked 
like the finely carved wooden hilt to a sword in her hands, an off 
look on her face. &quot;Is this what I think it is?&quot; Juri finally asked, 
gently touching the large red gem on the base.

&quot;It&#39;s not a master key,&quot; Minagi smiled, &quot;but it is a sword. Ayeka 
helped us to get it for you. Hold it and concentrate, and the blade 
should appear.&quot;

Juri held the hilt carefully, focusing on the weapon. In a moment, a 
bright orange blade sprung up from the hilt, lighting up the bar. 
&quot;Wow,&quot; Juri murmured. But once her concentration faltered, the blade 
was gone.

Juri took a moment to hug each of them before finally letting them go 
for the night. &quot;Remember the staff party,&quot; she reminded them, &quot;I&#39;d 
like to see you all there, with guests.&quot;

Once they were all gone, she took a moment to look around the bar 
before locking up. It was a bit too quiet, but the place would be 
filled with life again soon enough. She locked the door behind her, 
only to stop in surprise.

&quot;Setsuna?&quot; Juri called out.

The tall, dark hared woman turned to see Juri, clearly looking 
annoyed. &quot;Could you call me a cab?&quot; Setsuna scowled, &quot;It seems that my 
ride here forgot about me.&quot;

Juri silently thanked the gods. &quot;Stand there a moment,&quot; Juri said, and 
hurried around the side of the building. A few minutes later her 
sports car cruised to a stop in front of Setsuna. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a 
ride,&quot; Juri smiled.

Setsuna looked at her rather dubiously, and Juri smiled back at her 
winningly.

&quot;I promise I&#39;ll be on my best behavior,&quot; and Juri held up two fingers, 
&quot;scout&#39;s honor.&quot;

&quot;Where you ever a girl scout?&quot; Setsuna asked, climbing in beside Juri 
with a smile.

&quot;Well, no,&quot; Juri admitted, &quot;but it sounds better than butch&#39;s honor or 
something.&quot; She turned the heater up a bit before asking, &quot;Where to?&quot; 
And a few moments later they were off.
