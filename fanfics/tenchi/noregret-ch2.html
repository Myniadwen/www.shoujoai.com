<h1>No Need for Regrets (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/noregret-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Minagi repeated what they said for the third or fourth time, the 
information finally starting to actually sink in &quot;It&#39;s been over one 
hundred years?&quot;

Sasami and Washu both nodded to her in stereo, and Minagi groaned 
loudly and put her head into her hands. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Minagi,&quot; Washu 
said to her softly, reaching over to pat her gently on the shoulder. 
&quot;I wish I had been able to cure you faster, but there was just no 
way,&quot; she finished intensely, almost pleadingly.

&quot;Washu has been working tirelessly to save you,&quot; Sasami added quietly. 
&quot;If there was any other way, I&#39;m sure she would have found it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Minagi said with a casual wave of her hand, even as 
she forced a brave smile onto her face. She suddenly froze for a 
moment, then blurted out, &quot;My ship, Hinase!&quot; Minagi tried to stand, 
only to have Sasami rise to restrain her, her hand gentle on Minagi&#39;s 
arm.

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Sasami quickly reassured her. &quot;I&#39;ve been visiting and 
helping take care of her, as well as taking turns with the others.&quot;

Minagi sighed softly in relief, and Washu smiled a little. &quot;You do 
have quite a sense of responsibility, even for a good space-pirate,&quot; 
she teased her gently, with a bit of a mother&#39;s pride showing in her 
tone of voice.

Minagi stuck her tongue out at Washu, and the tension in the room 
dropped a bit. &quot;What happened to everybody, anyway?&quot; Minagi asked the 
two of them curiously.

A few minutes of explanation later, Minagi stared at Washu a moment in 
surprise, then she grinned widely. &quot;Congratulations, Mom!&quot; Minagi said 
happily, hugging Washu fiercely. &quot;Co-wife to Tenchi, Emperor of Jurai. 
So who&#39;s the other wife?&quot;

Sasami grinned impishly, leaning back in her chair as she answered 
&quot;Mihoshi.&quot; She didn&#39;t add anything else, just sat there and waited for 
Minagi&#39;s reaction.

She wasn&#39;t disappointed, as Minagi looked over at her in stunned 
disbelief. &quot;You&#39;re kidding me, right?&quot; Minagi asked each of them a bit 
desperately. Sasami and Washu both shook their heads, no, and Minagi 
sweatdropped.

The soft sound of a chime brought Washu&#39;s attention to her wristband. 
She activated a small device mounted there and a three dimensional 
image of Tenchi appeared before them. He looked only a little older, 
but carried a aura of responsibility and duty. The formal robes of the 
Emperor fit him well, or maybe Tenchi had simply grown to fit them, 
instead.

&quot;Washu, you&#39;re late for breakfast,&quot; Tenchi chided Washu gently, only 
to freeze when he saw Minagi sitting there beside Sasami and Washu. 
&quot;You&#39;re awake,&quot; he said to her happily!

Minagi smiled up at his image a bit shyly, &quot;You look good, milord. I 
understand it&#39;s been a long time, too.&quot;

Emperor Tenchi groaned at the use of his title. &quot;I get enough of that 
from the court,&quot; he said with a small laugh. &quot;I&#39;m still just Tenchi, 
Minagi, besides you&#39;re one of the family, stepdaughter,&quot; he said, the 
last bit with an impish smile on his face.

Minagi&#39;s mouth dropped open. Obviously, it hadn&#39;t yet occurred to her 
that Tenchi was, at least technically, now her &#39;dad&#39;. He, Washu and 
Sasami all broke into a fit of giggles, and she glared around the 
circle until they got themselves under control.

Washu got up and took off her long lab coat to reveal that she was 
wearing a set of semi casual robes underneath it. &quot;My dear husband,&quot; 
she said to the still happily grinning Tenchi, &quot;has just reminded me 
about a major diplomatic breakfast Mihoshi, Tenchi and I have to 
attend.&quot; She looked apologetically towards Minagi, and then asked 
Sasami, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but would you mind helping Minagi with any 
questions, until I can get back?&quot;

Sasami nodded eagerly, and Washu hesitantly moved to give Minagi a 
hug. Minagi looked a bit surprised, but she relaxed into the hug after 
a moment, as Washu softly said to her &quot;Everything will be all right, I 
promise.&quot; Minagi watched a slightly embarrassed Washu walk away, an 
odd little smile on Minagi&#39;s face.

&quot;You&#39;re probably going to have that happen to you a lot,&quot; Sasami said 
to Minagi with a smile on her face. As she was talking she went to a 
nearby compartment and then removed one of Minagi&#39;s usual bodysuits. 
&quot;You&#39;ll probably be a little more comfortable in this,&quot; Sasami added, 
a fond smile on her face. &quot;We made a few up for you, hoping you&#39;d get 
the chance to wear them soon.&quot;

Minagi looked down at the light medical sleeve she was wearing and 
nodded eagerly, &quot;Thank you, Sasami!&quot; She took her clothes from 
Sasami&#39;s hands even as she quickly pulled the clasps of her own garb 
open. In moments she was completely nude, then she pulled her fresh 
clothes on with no signs of any false modestly.

Sasami looked on wide-eyed as Minagi changed right in front of her. 
She had seen Minagi&#39;s nude body, of course, when she was helping Washu 
treat her. But now it seemed so different, the blood was pumping in 
her veins as she found she couldn&#39;t seem to look away.

Once Minagi was fully dressed, she turned back to say something to 
Sasami, only to meet her glazed stare. Only then did Minagi realize 
she might have offended her young friend with such a show of blatant 
nudity! &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sasami...&quot; Minagi started to say.

&quot;No, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Sasami hurriedly assured Minagi, her cheeks 
still flushed bright red. &quot;It&#39;s not anything I haven&#39;t seen before.&quot; 
She added in a rush, eager to try and change the topic &quot;Would you like 
to go outside?&quot;

As they walked together through the crowded halls of the hospital, she 
saw the visible respect Sasami was treated with. Even those of 
obviously noble blood quickly cleared the way for her! Minagi noticed 
that she, on the other hand, the people didn&#39;t know quite what to make 
of, other than the typical case of fear and terror her resemblance to 
Ryouko usually caused.

&#39;You&#39;d think the scarred cheeks would give people a clue I&#39;m not her,&#39; 
Minagi thought to herself wearily. She felt Sasami move, and noticed 
the shorter woman smiling up at her a little. Somehow, it made her 
feel a little better.

They stepped outside, and after taking in the view a moment, Minagi 
said softly &quot;Wow.&quot; Jurai still was, like the last time Minagi had 
visited, a strange mix of healthy green fields and plant life, and the 
highly advanced, organic technology that had made Jurai a great power 
across many systems. They stood there together a moment, letting the 
fresh breeze wash over them, the sunlight gently warming their skin, 
until Minagi shook herself.

Minagi turned to smile at Sasami and finally asked her &quot;I noticed you 
never said what happened to you?&quot;

Sasami blushed, brightly. &quot;Ayeka and I, we&#39;re Tenchi&#39;s top diplomats.&quot; 
she explained in her usual shy way to Minagi. She elaborated &quot;We 
settle disputes on colony worlds, help oversee the Galaxy Police, and 
whatever other jobs Tenchi needs us to do.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m very impressed,&quot; Minagi admitted, smiling at Sasami, a little shy 
too. She found herself looking at Sasami again, at the beautiful young 
woman who had grown so unexpectedly from the girl she had once known. 
&quot;You&#39;re a bit more older looking than I would have expected,&quot; Minagi 
said to her, a little awkwardly.

Sasami smiled and shrugged. &quot;Age is more a matter of choice for 
citizens of Jurai,&quot; she explained, &quot;and I felt a lot older than I 
looked, so I decided to change my appearance to something a bit closer 
to my mental age.&quot; She smiled a bit, pushing her hair back nervously 
as she asked &quot;You don&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;You look good,&quot; Minagi said to her softly. Sasami turned to look up 
at Minagi, and Minagi suddenly found herself lost in Sasami&#39;s eyes 
again. She couldn&#39;t get over how attractive Sasami had become, and she 
found it a little disturbing how she reacted to her!

Sasami gazed up into Minagi&#39;s catlike eyes, and again felt the 
stirring in her chest, the feeling almost like pain. She had thought 
it was just gratitude, at first, but as the years past and she toiled 
to save Minagi, she knew the feeling was deeper, and much stronger. 
&#39;It could even be love,&#39; Sasami admitted to herself.

Minagi swayed a bit towards Sasami, and Sasami took a hesitant half 
step forward, almost reaching the circle of Minagi&#39;s arms...

&quot;Minagi, you&#39;re all right!&quot; Ryouko&#39;s happy voice cut through the 
moment, and they jerked apart! Ryouko swooped down and clenched Minagi 
into a fierce hug, spinning her &#39;little sister&#39; in a tight circle!

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you, Minagi,&quot; Ayeka said, having walked up at a more 
reasonable, dignified pace. Once Ryouko let Minagi go, Ayeka then 
pulled her into a gentler hug, herself. &quot;We&#39;ve all missed you, my 
friend,&quot; Ayeka said softly, tears in her eyes.

&quot;Myah!&quot; the voice came from Minagi&#39;s feet. She looked down to see Ryo- 
ohki frantically rubbing up against her leg, the little cabbit purring 
at her happily. &quot;Myah, myah MYAH myah!&quot; she said happily.

Minagi bent down to scratch behind Ryo-ohki&#39;s ears, and it purred 
louder. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you, too,&quot; Minagi said smiling.

&quot;When did you wake up?&quot; Ryouko demanded to Minagi crossly. &quot;We were on 
our way to the official &#39;Let&#39;s wake up Minagi&#39; party Washu spent weeks 
planning, when we received a one line message that you woke up early, 
instead!&quot; she complained.

&quot;Just this morning,&quot; Minagi said, smiling over at them fondly. Minagi 
was used to Ryouko&#39;s shows of temper, and she had learned they were 
rarely genuine.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Ryouko,&quot; Ayeka gently chided her, a broad smile on her 
face. &quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be having a big party anyway, now that we can 
celebrate Minagi&#39;s finally being awake,&quot; she finished. The scowl on 
Ryouko&#39;s face seemed to soften as Ayeka gently lay her hand soothingly 
on Ryouko&#39;s arm. Ryouko smiled back at her, relaxing a bit.

&quot;I guess our over-achiever here just had to be up and around,&quot; Sasami 
forced herself to joke with them. She was so irritated at their 
interruption, she could just scream! She fought hard to swallow her 
anger, she knew Ayeka could always read her like a open book and she 
really didn&#39;t want to give away what she was feeling. &#39;Especially 
since I&#39;m not too sure about those feelings myself,&#39; she admitted to 
herself.

As they both caught Minagi up on their lives, she found herself 
watching Ayeka and Ryouko together. They smiled, touched each other 
often, and Minagi realized she had never seen either one of them look 
any happier. &#39;They&#39;re in love with each other,&#39; she thought, more than 
a bit surprised by that news, &#39;I wonder how long that&#39;s been going 
on?&#39;

&quot;So, Sasami tells me you two are diplomats?&quot; Minagi forced herself to 
ask them, even though she was still consumed by thoughts of the new 
knowledge she had discovered.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryouko laughs a bit, adding &quot;Ayeka&#39;s the brains of the outfit, 
and I&#39;m the muscle!&quot; She then made a over-dramatic body-builder&#39;s 
pose, and even Sasami joined them as they broke into a case of the 
group giggles.

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple,&quot; Ayeka said as she chuckled under her 
breath. &quot;Over the years Ryouko&#39;s met so many unusual alien species 
that her knowledge has been quite invaluable to me,&quot; Ayeka finished 
softly, looking adoringly up at Ryouko. Ryouko blushed, and then she 
reached out to take Ayeka&#39;s hand.

They talked a little while longer, until a cautiously smiling official 
appeared at Ayeka&#39;s side to whisper something softly in her ear. He 
seemed to try and keep as much distance between himself and Ryouko as 
possible. Ryouko grinned as she confided quietly to Minagi, &quot;The 
little paper pushers are terrified of me! It&#39;s great.&quot;

Ayeka listened to the message, nodded, and then said to Minagi and 
Sasami, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but Ryouko and I need to brief Tenchi on our last 
mission. Sasami,&quot; she put extra force behind her next words, &quot;we&#39;ll 
see each other at the predestined time.&quot;

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Minagi asked, frowning, as Ayeka dragged an 
oddly smiling Ryouko away! She turned to see Sasami frowning at the 
pairs retreating forms.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Sasami said, turning back to Minagi and forcing a smile, &quot;I&#39;m 
not entirely sure.&quot; She looked up at Minagi, and for a moment seemed 
at a loss for words.

Minagi asked hesitantly, &quot;Ayeka and Ryouko, are they...?&quot; She trailed 
off, unable to finish asking the question.

&quot;They&#39;re lovers, yes,&quot; Sasami said softly, looking up at Minagi 
worriedly. &quot;Does that bother you?&quot; she asked her softly in return.

Minagi shook her head, no. &quot;Actually, I think I&#39;m glad for them,&quot; she 
said to Sasami softly, &quot;I have never seen Ryouko with such a happy 
look on her face. Or Ayeka, either,&quot; she added the last with a impish 
smile on her face.

Sasami smiled shyly and took Minagi&#39;s arm in her own. She seemed about 
to say something more when she caught sight of her chronometer. &quot;Oh, 
no,&quot; she groaned aloud softly, &quot;I&#39;m going to be late!&quot; She looked up 
and Minagi and said in a little girl voice, &quot;Would you mind going with 
me on a little errand?&quot;

Minagi looked over at Sasami thoughtfully, then shrugged helplessly. 
&quot;Sure, why not,&quot; she answered in a preoccupied tone. &#39;What was she 
going to say to me?&#39; Minagi wondered. They bustled down several 
hallways until they came upon a unmarked door.

Sasami gently opened it, revealing pitch-black darkness inside. 
&quot;Minagi,&quot; she said frowning, &quot;the power seems to be out. Could you go 
in first, please?&quot;

&quot;Well, all right,&quot; Minagi said, stepping into the dark room.

Before she could take another step, multiple voices loudly yelled 
&quot;SURPRISE!&quot;

The lights suddenly came on and she saw the small room was decked out 
for a party! Tenchi, Mihoshi, and Washu grinned at her from one side, 
and Ayeka, Ryouko, and Ayeka and Sasami&#39;s mothers, the former 
Empresses Misaki and Funaho smiled cheerfully at her from the other. 
Asahi and Gohgei from Ryuten were there as well, old friends from 
their earlier adventures. A extremely large chocolate cake rested on a 
nearby table with the words &#39;Welcome back!&#39; on it, the table also 
strained to the breaking point with food and beverages!

The Empress Mihoshi suddenly dropped any pretense at dignity or 
restraint and hit Minagi with a flying hug, bawling loudly. &quot;Oh, 
Minagi! I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re back!&quot; she sobbed, resting her head on 
Minagi&#39;s shoulder, and quickly soaking the shoulder pad on her 
costume.

After a few minutes, Minagi managed to disengage herself from the 
happily weeping Mihoshi only to then be hit with Misaki&#39;s flying hug, 
instead! &quot;Thank you so much, for saving our daughter,&quot; a more serious 
Funaho said to her, watching with a small smile on her face as Minagi 
struggled to get free of the joyful Misaki&#39;s death grip.

Minagi looked over at Funaho while she was still circled in Misaki&#39;s 
arms, and blushed a bit as she said softly, &quot;It was my pleasure.&quot;

Funaho just smiled mysteriously as she said to her, &quot;Sasami is very 
glad you recovered.&quot; She continued, staring meaningfully at Minagi &quot;I 
want you to know that we&#39;re very happy to have you in our extended 
family.&quot;

Minagi sweatdropped at that reply, and she wondered if, maybe, she had 
said something wrong. Or misunderstood what Funaho was saying.

Asashi made her way over to Minagi&#39;s side, smiling up at her. The dark 
hared younger woman held the fighting monk Gohgei&#39;s arm as if she 
never intended to let it go. &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you recovered,&quot; she said 
cheerfully.

Gohgei nodded thoughtfully, &quot;Sasami has missed you greatly.&quot;

Minagi was a bit surprised by the gentle emphasis he put on his words. 
As the party really got underway, Minagi made her way to where Sasami 
was standing in a quiet corner, mock glared at the broadly smiling 
girl and said, &quot;Oh, are you going to pay for this!&quot;

Sasami grinned cheerfully back at her, &quot;Promises, promises.&quot;

Minagi laughed softly as the sweet sound of Jurai&#39;s formal dance music 
began to play. &#39;Why not,&#39; Sasami thought to herself, stepping up to 
stand by Minagi. &quot;Would you like to dance?&quot; Sasami asked Minagi with 
as much courage as she could possibly muster.

Minagi looked a bit surprised, then she reached out to gently take 
Sasami in her arms. They moved out to a open area of the room and then 
began to gently sway together to the soft music. &quot;You&#39;re pretty good 
at this,&quot; Minagi said to Sasami softly, cradling her close to her as 
they slow danced together.

&quot;No,&quot; Sasami said with a blush, &quot;I think you just lead very well.&quot; 
Neither one said any more as they continued to dance together until 
the music finally stopped. </pre>
