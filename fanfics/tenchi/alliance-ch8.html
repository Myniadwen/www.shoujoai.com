<h1>Alliance (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rann.html">Rann Aridorn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/alliance-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;It&#39;s pretty much worked out,&quot; Washu said through the beginnings of a 
yawn, bringing a hand up to cover the rest of it. &quot;Two Juraian knights 
will join every legion of Hyurodan guards, and I&#39;ll hold daily 
holographic meetings with the senators. Should achieve a nice 
balance.&quot;

&quot;You seem exhausted, Washu,&quot; Funaho murmured, stepping close and 
laying a hand on the queen&#39;s shoulder. The Juraian empress&#39; kimono was 
done up fully today, hiding the silver strips around her middle that 
continued to heal her energy sword wound even as she moved about as if 
nothing were troubling her.

&quot;I am, to tell the truth. I&#39;ve been on the comm all night, waking up 
senators, who are likely only not joining the revolt out of some 
lingering respect for the fact that I appointed them.&quot; The pink-haired 
Hyurodan turned a tired smile to the other woman. &quot;I&#39;m joking, of 
course. I wouldn&#39;t have appointed them if I didn&#39;t trust them.&quot;

&quot;Now I know you&#39;re tired, my friend. You never explain yourself so 
openly unless it somehow flaunts your intellect,&quot; Funaho teased 
gently, smiling back. &quot;To bed with you, then. If we are to leave this 
afternoon as you&#39;ve asked, you have plenty of time to get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; grunted Washu like an old, cranky woman as she stood 
slowly, putting both of her hands on her back and bending to work out 
a few kinks. The fact of the matter was that she was quite an old 
woman by most species&#39; standards. Only middle-aged by Hyurodan 
standards, and she&#39;d had her daughter relatively late in life. &#39;Ah, 
the quandry of whether to make the same choices all over again.&#39;

&quot;Is this yours, Washu?&quot; Funaho leaned forward slightly, plucking up a 
flower that was laying on the table. It was actually two flowers, 
springing from a single stem, the small blossoms surprisingly 
different, though obviously of the same type, with flat, teardrop 
petals that curled out and down from the center. One blossom was a 
deep, rich red with random-seeming colors speckled across the petals, 
while the other was a soft yellow with small purple dots forming a 
neat pattern. The center of each blossom, however, was the same royal 
purple.

&quot;Hm? That? Oh, no, Ryoko was fiddling with that earlier while she was 
in here with me, before muttering something about using the guards for 
something and hurrying off. Kids today.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful.&quot; The Juraian woman cupped the flower in her hands and 
brought it to her face, inhaling slowly, then made a soft sound of 
pleasure. &quot;And it smells lovely. Like... the hour of the morning where 
the night has not yet receded but the light of the dawn shines 
brightly.&quot;

Washu chuckled. &quot;Very poetic. Unfortunately, Hyurodan poetry is almost 
without exception absolutely terrible, and it bears the very unpoetic 
name of &#39;rock lily&#39;. They grow in cracks of rocks, usually tend to 
hide in shadow. They&#39;re prolific and always come back no matter how 
often they&#39;re picked, but they&#39;re a pain in the ass to get out of the 
rocks, and hard to find in the first place. They&#39;re pretty, but few 
would consider them worth the trouble.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Ayeka&#39;s pout was already in place as she started to wake up. She&#39;d 
gone to sleep upset, and had every intention of remaining so when she 
got up. However, the first thing to assail her senses was an 
absolutely beguiling smell, which settled into her mind like a welcome 
cool fog on a hot day, and before she even opened her eyes she could 
not help but start to feel positive about the day.

When she opened her eyes, a gasp escaped her lips before she could 
even consciously register what she was seeing. Her room had exploded 
in color! Was she going mad, seeing spots before her eyes? But, no... 
as the haziness of morning vision cleared her eyes, she saw that what 
she&#39;d taken for blasts of pure color were instead small flowers, lain 
over every flat surface almost like a carpet, pinned or tucked into 
every non-flat surface that they could possibly be affixed to with any 
sort of ease.

&#39;Oh... oh my,&#39; Ayeka thought, putting a hand to her mouth, stunned 
with the beauty of it, and the... the romance? Was that it? She 
flushed slightly, looking down at the flowers spread across her 
bedcovers, and spotted a rectangle of white amidst the vibrant color. 
Picking it up, she saw her name emblazoned on the front in purple ink, 
in a hand attempting to be elegant but obviously unused to it.

Opening the card, her expression wary, Ayeka began to read the words, 
written in that same attempt-at-elegance handwriting at first, but 
slowly progressing into a more simple if still carefully-done style, 
and finally during the last few words turning rather messy. But 
despite the degradation of effort put into the handwriting, Ayeka&#39;s 
wary look progressed steadily into a smile as she read.

- Ayeka,

I know I screwed up pretty bad last night, and I&#39;m really sorry. 
There, I said it, are you happy? Well... you better be. I had every 
royal guard in the castle out digging around in the rocks to get these 
things for you, and I&#39;m pretty sure they intend to murder me in my 
sleep for their scratched fingers and broken nails. So don&#39;t get used 
to me doing nice things... I probably won&#39;t be around to do them for 
much longer.

Anyway, don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t let them in your room. I cleared it with 
your maid or whatever she is and then came in through the balcony. If 
you&#39;re pissed about me being in your room while you were asleep, well, 
tough, because if I feel like doing something nice for my fiancee 
after inspiring traitorous thoughts in my loyal guards, then I&#39;m damn 
well going to do it.

I have to go now. Kallista and Riyata are coming over here, and I 
think they have rope, and I don&#39;t think they intend anything fun with 
it.

Ryoko -

&#39;Oh, Ryoko.&#39; Ayeka sighed softly, smiling and falling onto her back, 
the card held to her chest, eyes sinking closed. &#39;I am happy. And I am 
very impressed and grateful.&#39; Her smile turned rather wicked. &#39;And I 
am never, ever, EVER going to let you know that.&#39;

------------------------------------------------------------

Kallista sighed, examining her torn and broken nails as she walked 
along towards the kitchen. Getting rousted from her bed only minutes 
after she&#39;d gotten Riyata to calm down enough to get to sleep was bad 
enough, as was spending all night and morning flying over most of the 
hemisphere finding rock lilies... to know she was doing it so that 
Ryoko could do something nice for that annoying little Juraian 
princess was all the more galling. At least she&#39;d made sure they 
hadn&#39;t woken Riyata. A few guards were wearing spear shaft-shaped red 
marks across their butts to emphasize Kallista&#39;s displeasure at THAT 
notion.

As Kallista emerged into the large kitchen, she spied a figure draped 
in white sitting at one of the plain tables the kitchen staff often 
ate at. The Hyurodan guard blinked a bit, then shrugged and waved a 
hand, getting a cook&#39;s attention, then tilting her head to show where 
she was going to be sitting. As she made her way over, the 
orange-haired woman observed her target.

Kiyone seemed out of place in the bustling, plain kitchen, wearing her 
elegant and spotless white Juraian kimono and headband, and with her 
posture, poise, and grace. And yet, despite the calm, cultured look on 
her face and her dress, there was something... unprepossessing about 
her, as if she had no problems with eating in a kitchen with scullery 
staff surrounding her, and in fact was comfortable with it. That 
manner made her seem to belong... even if at the same time she was out 
of place.

&quot;Hey there,&quot; Kallista said with what good cheer she could muster as 
she stepped over the bench to sit down next to Kiyone.

&quot;... Good morning,&quot; the Juraian replied with unintoned politeness, 
taking another spoonful of the soup the kitchen was serving as its 
&#39;simple&#39; breakfast for the morning.

Kallista raised an eyebrow at that, then shrugged and looked down at 
her own bowl as it was set before her. Fairly typical stuff, a 
somewhat thick mash that had a sort of soft, sweet taste to it. The 
Hyurodan woman ate a few spoonfuls in silence, then tried again. 
&quot;Sleep well last night?&quot;

&quot;... Yes, thank you.&quot; Kiyone&#39;s cheeks colored faintly, but she allowed 
neither her expression nor her tone to change. &quot;And you?&quot;

&quot;Nope. After I left you, I went to comfort my friend who lost her 
lover in the assault, then got rousted out of bed to go search for 
flowers, of all things.&quot; Nodding her thanks to a servant girl who set 
down a glass of juice for her, Kallista took a drink, waiting for a 
few minutes to see if Kiyone said anything. When the silence 
continued, she cleared her throat, and said, quite bluntly, &quot;Is this 
your version of &#39;the fuck was nice, now take a hike&#39;?&quot;

Kiyone started a bit at the crude language, then turned slightly on 
the bench and gave Kallista a dirty look. &quot;No, it&#39;s not, though that&#39;s 
what I thought you wanted anyway.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;d ya think that?&quot; Kallista took another spoonful of her soup, 
slim orange eyebrows arcing up a bit.

&quot;You come into my room, announce &#39;to hell with it&#39; and start ripping 
off my clothes, and leave almost immediately after we&#39;re done.&quot; Kiyone 
scowled down at her own breakfast, picking at it with her spoon as if 
having lost her appetite. &quot;It seemed like the very definition of a one 
night stand.&quot;

&quot;Okay, so shoot me if I&#39;m not sensitive and emotional and crap!&quot; 
Kallista snapped back, then sighed, again almost immediately 
regretting her words. &quot;Oy... okay, look, I really am sorry I didn&#39;t 
make myself more clear.&quot;

&quot;I thought it was clear,&quot; the Juraian muttered sulkily.

&quot;Not THAT!&quot; Kallista shung her head momentarily, shark&#39;s-fin hair 
swaying behind her. Then she straightened up and scooted a little 
closer to the other woman. &quot;I meant... okay, look, it may have been a 
kinda impulsive thing, but I genuinely like and respect you, Blue 
Fire.&quot;

&quot;... Yeah?&quot; The green-haired woman seemed to be trying to hold on to 
her bad mood, though her tone held a tiny note of hope.

&quot;Yeah. I like you, I respect you... I&#39;m sure as hell attracted to you. 
Isn&#39;t that enough to just be lovers for awhile?&quot;

&quot;... Maybe.&quot; Kiyone looked at Kallista out of the corner of her eye, 
then sighed. &quot;Unfortunately, we&#39;re leaving for Jurai this afternoon.&quot;

&quot;I know. I&#39;m going with you.&quot;

&quot;Y-you are?&quot; Indigo eyes went wide, and Kiyone swallowed, feeling 
bursts of nervousness, relief, and apprehension well up inside her.

&quot;Yup. So if you&#39;re okay with it, I&#39;d like ta continue our little thing 
when we get there.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Kiyone looked down, then smiled a little at the other woman. 
&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;

&quot;Sure, no pressure.&quot;

Both women resumed eating, seeming much more at ease now that some of 
the tension had been resolved. But a great deal of it was still there, 
wrapping itself around them, unresolved issues lurking just in the 
wings and waiting for a slipup from either of them to send their 
little casual relationship crashing to the floor.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;They&#39;ve filed a flight plan... they&#39;re leaving in a few hours.&quot;

&quot;Excellent. Alert the proper number of rebels as to their exact flight 
plan.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Careful, please!&quot; Ayeka called haughtily, gazing reproachingly at one 
of the Hyurodan castle staff that was carrying a trunk of her clothing 
out of the room. &quot;Those trunks are very important to me, they are 
priceless treasures!&quot; &#39;And there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going back to where I 
bought them, the staff was horribly rude there.&#39;

&quot;Ayeka,&quot; Ryoko said quietly as she approached the Juraian princess 
from behind, voice casual and perhaps expectant.

&quot;Ryoko,&quot; Ayeka returned in a neutral tone, nodding once to the other 
princess, then once more tucking her hands inside the sleeves of her 
elegant blue-and-purple traveling kimono and watching the movers 
critically.

Blinking a bit at the total lack of reaction, Ryoko leaned a bit to 
the side to look into Ayeka&#39;s room. There wasn&#39;t a single rock lily to 
be seen, it was as if they&#39;d never been there. By now a bit puzzled, 
wondering if she&#39;d somehow forgotten to actually put the flowers in 
her fiancee&#39;s room as she remembered doing, or if she&#39;d merely dreamed 
the whole thing, Ryoko turned her curious gaze to Ayeka.

But the Juraian princess apparently had no attention to spare for the 
other girl. Privately, it was difficult not to grin, smirk, or in some 
other way acknowledge that there had been any form of appeasement at 
all, other than the fact that she was treating Ryoko civilly.

&quot;So, uh, we&#39;re all goin&#39; on your treeship, huh?&quot; Ryoko tried, resting 
her arms behind her head.

&quot;Treeships, actually,&quot; Ayeka replied, deigning to favor her fiancee 
with a small smile. &quot;My mothers are each bonded to a Juraian royal 
tree. Mizuho and Karin are very unique treeships, however... they are 
twins, and in fact are bonded together so closely that they appear to 
be but a single ship. So it is very large, and very comfortable.&quot;

&quot;Huh. You got one of those treeship things yet?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Ayeka let her face return to neutral. &quot;No treeship has spoken 
out to me yet. Likely as part of my coming-of-age ceremonies, to be 
held soon, I will spend days in one of the royal arboretums, fasting 
and meditating, awaiting a tree to speak out to me.&quot;

Heartened by the fact that they were engaging in an actual 
conversation, Ryoko lifted off the floor, tucking her legs up under 
her and floating a little closer to the other young woman. &quot;So, these 
treeships... do they just fade away when the person they&#39;re bonded to 
dies or somethings.&quot;

&quot;Occassionally. Often they merely replant themselves and await a new 
person who they feel is proper to bond with. Sometimes a tree so 
dearly loves the person that they are bonded with that they choose not 
to continue after they die. In fact, there is a tale of just such a 
thing.&quot;

&quot;Well, I like stories.&quot; Ryoko nudged Ayeka lightly with her elbow. 
&quot;C&#39;mon, tell me.&quot;

Frowning briefly at being poked, but seeming to appreciate Ryoko&#39;s 
attentiveness, Ayeka cleared her throat, taking on a tone similar to a 
schoolgirl reading a report in front of her class.

&quot;Long ago, when the Empire was only beginning to grow, the two 
greatest Juraian Trees ever to take leaf were grown, Tsunami and 
Mizutamari. They were siblings, and loved one another very much, 
though they were as different as the night and the day. Tsunami was 
fair, and gentle, and spoke only in soft words, and gave aid to all 
that she could, while Mizutamari was dark, and rough, and was often 
harsh in what he said, and believed in letting others find their own 
way and their own strength.

&quot;Tsunami was bonded to the Empress, and Mizutamari to the Emperor. 
Never had such bonds of love existed between Juraian trees and Juraian 
royalty, and it was said that the royal couple loved their trees as 
dearly as one another, and with good reason, for though Tsunami was 
gentle and kind, she was also a fearsome warship and many times 
defended all of Jurai from attack, and though Mizutamari was rough and 
aggressive, he was a strong passenger ship and never failed to bring 
those under his care safely to their destination.

&quot;Eventually, though, time took its toll, and the Emperor and Empress 
began to die. A great and heated argument broke out between Tsunami 
and Mizutamari. Mizutamari loved the Emperor and Empress greatly, and 
said that he could not imagine existence without them, and wished to 
pass over the final threshold with them. Tsunami loved them just as 
greatly, but was adamant in the belief that one day Jurai would need 
them again, and they could not afford to indulge themselves in such 
things, even if it were such a great act of love.

&quot;And so, when the time came, the argument unresolved, Mizutamari chose 
to end his life with that of the Emperor and Empress, while Tsunami 
remained, replanting herself in the royal arboretum, and awaiting the 
time when she would again feel the proper bond, and rise again to 
defend the Empire in its time of greatest need.&quot;

&quot;Nice little story,&quot; Ryoko murmured, more amused by Ayeka&#39;s manner 
throughout than she was by the tale itself. &quot;So, did Tsunami ever find 
someone to bond with again?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Ayeka shook her head, seeming to have discarded her more formal 
storytelling method. &quot;She is still in the innermost royal arboretum at 
the center of the palace, silent and still, waiting.&quot;

&quot;Must be lonely for her,&quot; Ryoko said, almost startling herself with 
her own sincerity. Perhaps the recounting of the myth or history or 
whatever it was had gotten to her more than she&#39;d thought. But somehow 
she really did feel bad for Tsunami, alone in that place, without the 
two people she&#39;d loved most, or her brother.

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Ayeka allowed after a moment, looking rather annoyed. She 
felt irritable at the thought of Tsunami being lonely, though she 
really couldn&#39;t think why. After a few long minutes of thought, she 
decided that it was probably because Tsunami was such a part of 
history, glorified and exaulted through so many generations, that it 
was a little unsettling to ascribe such a merely human feeling as 
&quot;loneliness&quot; to her.

Seeming to sense that she was treading a fine line towards pissing 
Ayeka off again, though she couldn&#39;t quite understand why, Ryoko 
debated her options. She could either just plain back off and leave, 
try to make it better... or try to make it worse. The last option was 
certainly attractive in its own way, as she very much enjoyed her 
little spats with the other princess, especially since they tended to 
culminate in a giant catfight.

After a few moments&#39; consideration, though, Ryoko decided it was a 
little too soon after her big screwup to try and recapture that old 
flame, since there was a little too much margin for it to actually 
make Ayeka seriously and lastingly ticked at her again. So, instead, 
she settled for something a little ways between option one and option 
two.

&quot;Guess I should go do my own packing. I&#39;ll see you aboard ship...?&quot;

Ayeka nodded slightly. &quot;... Indeed. I will see you then, Ryoko.&quot;

&quot;Later, Ayeka.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I miss you.&quot;

&quot;I miss you as well,&quot; Funaho murmured, her voice carrying a great 
tenderness even as her smile to her husband was rather soft and a bit 
restrained. &quot;But we shall be home soon.&quot;

Emperor Azusa leaned back on his throne, regarding the holoimage of 
his wife solemnly, much as he wished he could reach out and attempt to 
put his hand over hers, as impossible as it was. Yet even over the 
distance of holoprojection, when his eyes met hers, he could tell that 
she felt how much he yearned for her, and could feel the same thing in 
her own gaze.

&quot;I look forward to meeting my little daughter&#39;s fiancee,&quot; he added, 
though his fingers clenched slightly on the arms of the throne, and 
his voice betrayed a certain tightness.

Funaho smiled just a little wider, feeling laughter bubbling about 
inside her. &#39;Doting as always, my love.&#39; &quot;Ayeka is not all that little 
anymore, Azusa.&quot; She let the laughter show in her eyes as she looked 
at him. So handsome, so imposing, with his thick dark beard and hair, 
his broad shoulders. So royal and elegant, even if he was acting like 
any common father displeased with his daughter&#39;s growing up. &quot;She is a 
grown woman now, having had the first emergence of her power. Even if 
she still has some growing up to do, we can hardly continue to treat 
her as a child.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Azusa replied in a perfectly reasonable tone, which 
translated to: &#39;I can and will and I fully intend to!&#39;

Bemused, not having been fooled at all, Funaho raised her hand and 
held it out with her fingers spread, Azusa copying the action a moment 
later. There was a faint flicker on both ends as flesh and blood 
brushed against photons.

&quot;I love you, Azusa, and will be glad to be home again.&quot;

&quot;As I love you, Funaho. Hurry back.&quot;

Funaho nodded once, then rose and moved aside and back, allowing 
Misaki to plop down in the chair she had previously occupied.

&quot;Hiiiii honey!&quot; Misaki cooed, propping her elbows up on the control 
panel and resting her chin against her palms.

&quot;Misaki,&quot; Azusa replied with a smile, voice turning warm and cheerful. 
&quot;You&#39;re taking good care of Funaho while she is recuperating, I hope?&quot;

&quot;Oh, you know her, she never listens to me,&quot; Misaki snorted, sticking 
out her tongue a bit in a gesture of disgust, while Funaho merely 
looked bemused where she stood in the background. &quot;But I&#39;m doing my 
best, of course! You&#39;re really gonna like Washu, honey, she&#39;s a lot of 
fun, and I think Ayeka really likes Ryoko!&quot;

&quot;Ah... does she?&quot; Azusa murmured, obviously fearing for his daughter&#39;s 
virtue.

&quot;Uh-huh, you can tell by the way they try to kill each other!&quot; the 
blue-haired empress chirped. Both Funaho and Azusa developed rather 
large sweatdrops. &quot;Anyway, sweety, gotta go! It&#39;s almost time for us 
to leave!&quot;

On Azusa&#39;s side of the connection, the hologram of Misaki suddenly 
moved up, becoming life-sized, and proceeded to grab the Emperor and 
give him a very solid kiss. Then, fading back to normal proportions, 
she waved cheerily. &quot;Bai!&quot;

Azusa stared at the holoimage as it derezzed, eyes wide, then 
murmured, &quot;How does she DO that?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;You look adorable,&quot; Ayeka assured her little sister, adjusting 
Sasami&#39;s traveling kimono, which was an exact duplicate of her own, 
albeit sized appropriately.

&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Sasami replied dubiously, but offered no real objection. 
Ayeka occassionally enjoyed dressing them both alike, something Sasami 
thought had more to do with her big sister&#39;s vanity than with an 
attempt to look like sisters. Once Ayeka was satisfied that Sasami was 
properly attired, she moved towards the staircase, Sasami pausing only 
long enough to bend down a bit so that Ryo-Ohki could scramble onto 
her head.

Descending the stairs, they found that most everyone was waiting on 
them, grouped together and talking amongst themselves. Funaho was 
speaking with Washu about the care typically given to Juraian trees in 
the royal arboretums, the dimunutive Hyurodan queen attired in a dark 
long-sleeved shirt with golden buttons, a green vest, and khaki 
shorts. Kiyone seemed to be giving Mihoshi some sort of lecture while 
Kallista and Riyata looked on in amusement, the Juraian maidservants 
in their simple white kimonos, and the Hyurodan guards, as always, in 
their gold breastplates and white loincloths, golden spears resting 
against their shoulders.

&quot;Ah! You two look sooooo cute!&quot; Misaki cried, hurrying over to sieze 
Sasami in a tight hug.

Ayeka started to answer, but became mildly distracted when she noticed 
Ryoko was looking at her. The Hyurodan princess was wearing very, very 
tight black pants and a shirt of scarlet silk, which only seemed to be 
buttoned up about halfway, leaving the shirtfront draping over the 
full curves of her breasts, and making it abundantly clear she wasn&#39;t 
wearing anything under it. Noticing Ayeka&#39;s gaze, Ryoko tilted down 
the mirrored sunglasses she was wearing, amber eyes dancing a bit.

&quot;Something catch your eye, Ayeka?&quot;

Ayeka immediately gave a haughty sniff and turned her nose up. &quot;Only 
that the quality of that shirt is greater than the quality of the one 
wearing it.&quot;

Ryoko snorted and used her middle finger to push her sunglasses back 
up. &quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot;

&quot;Now now, children,&quot; Washu scolded with a smirk on her face. &quot;We have 
a long flight ahead of us, and I don&#39;t want to have to seperate you 
two.&quot;

&quot;They have more power when they collide, don&#39;t they?&quot; Funaho added 
mildly as she walked towards the main entrance of the castle.

Most everyone stared after her, silent, staring a bit.

&quot;Did... FUNAHO just make a double entendre?&quot; Ryoko murmured, her 
glasses slipping down her nose again.

&quot;Oh, you&#39;d be surprised at all the things she can say when properly 
motivated,&quot; Misaki chirped, following after her cowife, leaving yet 
more stares and not a few sweatdrops in her wake.

The transport ride to the spaceport was quiet, mostly because most of 
the younger people were still staring at the Empresses as if not quite 
sure what to make of them at the moment.

&quot;Will we be taking an orbital transport to the station where Mizuho 
and Karin are docked as we did last time?&quot; Funaho inquired of Washu, 
seeming to not even notice the fact that Ryoko was sitting across from 
her, watching as if she expected the dark-haired woman to sprout a few 
extra appendages.

&quot;No, the orbital transports are temporarily grounded, what with the 
recent terrorist attack,&quot; Washu said, seeming chipper anyway. &quot;We&#39;ll 
be taking the orbital elevator. It&#39;s a fifteen minute ride instead of 
a five minute one, but it&#39;d take something the size of your ship 
running into it to damage it. All the luggage is already aboard, we&#39;re 
the last bit of cargo to take up!&quot;

The transport drew to a halt beside the orbital elevator, a shining 
semitransparent tube that went up into the sky, seeming to curve 
slightly somewhere beyond the clouds, even though it ran in a 
perfectly straight line all the way up to the station where the 
Juraian treeships were docked. Without ceremony, the royals and their 
entourage entered the elevator cab, which was a little smaller than 
the dining room of the castle they&#39;d just left. Save for a few benches 
and long rectangular windows, it was unadorned.

Funaho moved to sit down, flanked by Misaki and Washu, and Ayeka 
suppressed a little qualm as she realized she&#39;d forgotten that her 
comother was injured. Funaho seemed so composed and so graceful that 
it was hard to imagine that she was still healing, even from such a 
grievous injury as being run through with an energy blade.

Riyata and Kallista almost casually took up positions to either side 
of the doorway, and Ayeka found that Kiyone had drifted closer beside 
her, and Mihoshi was, at the moment, helping Sasami up to stand on one 
of the benches so she could more easily look out the window, then 
staying close by, hands on the little princess&#39; shoulders. It was a 
subtle reminder that the danger of the rebels displeased with Washu&#39;s 
rule had not passed.

Ryoko seemed unaffected, however, simply leaning back against the wall 
of the elevator carriage, arms folded over her chest, one foot raised 
up to rest against the wall, the other tapping against the floor for a 
moment. &#39;I wonder where she bought those?&#39; Ayeka thought, focusing on 
the black low-heeled shoes Ryoko was wearing rather than the fact that 
obviously the guards didn&#39;t feel the royals were quite safe, despite 
what Washu had said about the orbital elevator.

Ayeka noticed that the foot-tapping had stopped, and looked up to see 
that Ryoko was beckoning her over with one finger. Plastering a 
put-upon look on her face, the Juraian princess moved over, only 
pausing as the floor shuddered faintly under her feet, causing her to 
look about in startlement.

&quot;We&#39;re moving!&quot; Sasami cried delightedly, eyes fixed out the window as 
they began accellerating rapidly.

Trying to calm her rapidly-beating heart, Ayeka resumed her short 
walk, coming to stand in front of Ryoko. &quot;Yes? What is it?&quot;

&quot;Relax a little, princess. You look too jumpy.&quot; Ryoko grinned at her, 
cat&#39;s-eyes hidden behind the mirrored lenses. &quot;If you get all scared, 
you can just hold onto me.&quot;

&quot;Hmph!&quot; Ayeka turned her nose up and her head away, eyes closed to 
give her face the maximum expression of haughtiness. &quot;I assure you, I 
am perfectly fine and in need of no such thing!&quot;

&quot;Fine, fine, suit yourself.&quot;

There was a faint chime from hidden speakers, preceeding an artificial 
voice coached into a sort of neutral pleasantness.

~Hello, and welcome aboard the Magnificent Spaceport Company&#39;s orbital 
elevator 1567-E, service to Magnificent Spaceport modular geosync 
station H3N7A1. Transit time today will be approximately sixteen 
minutes from the chime.~ *ding* ~The station has today been arranged 
to provide direct corridor access to the Juraian ship MizuhoKarin. If 
this is not in accordance with your travel plans, we apologize for the 
inconvenience; please inform one of the attendants upon your arrival. 
Thank you for using Magnificent Spaceport Company services, and have a 
good trip!~

&quot;I think whoever writes those things was on a good trip,&quot; Kallista 
snorted under her breath.

Little else was said during the short ride, as the blue sky outside 
faded into dark navy, and then into black with steady, bright shining 
stars. There was a brief view of the silver slope of the space 
station, and an arch of Mizuho and Karin&#39;s bow, before the elevator 
was sliding into its docking port aboard the station. The doors slid 
open, revealing a long, wide hallway, and two attractive Hyurodan 
wearing dark teal miniskirts and uniform jackets, as well as odd 
little berets.

&#39;I never quite got why some people think those stewardess outfits are 
so hot, I think they&#39;re ugly as hell,&#39; Ryoko thought with a mental 
scoff, pushing off the wall and walking for the exit.

&quot;Welcome to Magnificent Spaceport Company geographically synchronous 
station H3N7A1,&quot; one of the stewardesses bubbled at no one in 
particular. &quot;I hope your ride up was pleasant?&quot;

&quot;No, the elevator developed a hull fracture and we all explosively 
decompressed,&quot; Ryoko replied blandly, much to the amusement of her 
guards, mother, and her Juraian guests, though the latter tried not to 
show it.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; The stewardess cleared her throat, having to do her very best 
not to shoot the rather high-ranking VIP a dirty look. &quot;If you&#39;ll 
follow us, it&#39;s just a brief walk to your ship.&quot;

Both of the station attendants turned around to lead the way, 
revealing the little cotton puff &quot;bunny tails&quot; affixed to the backs of 
their skirts. Still, despite her opinion of the uniforms, Ryoko 
couldn&#39;t help but notice that they did flattering things for the hips 
and rear. &#39;Hm, maybe I can see the attraction.&#39; Ryoko glanced at 
Ayeka, out of the corner of her eye, hidden by her sunglasses, then 
grinned a bit. &#39;... Nah. She&#39;d never go for it.&#39;

&#39;If only the color weren&#39;t so horrible, I&#39;d look magnificent in one of 
those,&#39; Ayeka thought rather wistfully, averting her eyes upwards to 
keep them off of the stewardess&#39;... tails.

&#39;Perhaps it&#39;s time to get Misaki&#39;s stewardess uniform out of storage,&#39; 
Funaho mused.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;These will be your quarters,&quot; Misaki said brightly, throwing open 
several doors. &quot;The ship&#39;s garden is that way, entertainment area on 
the one side of it, observation area on the other. If you need 
anything else, please don&#39;t hesitate to call us.&quot;

The empress swept off to her own room to see to Funaho as the Hyurodan 
began settling into their own rooms, the duck shuddering 
ever-so-faintly under their feet as it disembarked from the space 
station and began its gradual acceleration to the edge of the system.

&quot;Quite a ship, huh?&quot; Kallista said appreciatively as she flopped down 
on a red velvet &quot;fainting couch&quot;. &quot;I think this place if fancier than 
the castle back home.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d wager money on it,&quot; Riyata murmured, crouching down on one knee 
and resting a bit of her weight on her spear. &quot;I mean, if their ships 
are this opulent, can you imagine what the palace must be like?&quot;

&quot;Quite a bit more amazing.&quot;

Both guards blinked and looked over at Washu, who was standing with 
her fists on her hips and a smug look on her face.

&quot;You&#39;ve been to the Juraian royal palace?&quot; Kallista said, rather 
impressed.

&quot;Oh, a long, long time ago, back when I was attending the science 
academy on Jurai.&quot;

&quot;You mean back when the sulfur pools heated and the first amino acids 
began joining together to create cells?&quot; Ryoko snickered from nearby.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you think I&#39;m God, Ryoko, but if you&#39;re going to kiss up, do 
it here, huh?&quot; Washu replied with a smirk, tilting her head and 
tapping her cheek. Once Ryoko had rolled her eyes and given her mother 
a kiss on the cheek, Washu continued, folding her arms over her chest. 
&quot;The Juraian royal palace was begun almost four million years ago, and 
wasn&#39;t completed until about 500,000 years ago, and is the size of a 
large city. It contains four arboretums, each at least twenty miles in 
diameter, with the main arboretum far below the ground over fifty 
miles in diameter. At least two of its towers had to be built by 
workers wearing vacuum suits due to the height coming close to 
scraping the stratosphere. It contains a small planetoid&#39;s worth of 
minerals, a lot of it white marble. It has its own population of 
maintainers and servants, and contains for them its own restaurants, 
shopping areas, and of course many different sports arenas and parks.&quot;

&quot;Good lord, there must be almost as many people living there as there 
are on our homeworld,&quot; Riyata said, exchanging a slack-jawed look with 
Kallista.

&quot;Not quite, but it might be an embarrassing comparison all the same,&quot; 
Washu murmured, looking bemused for a moment, then shaking her head. 
&quot;But we&#39;re two very different races, remember girls. Though the Jurai 
have greater cities and many more colony worlds, few outside of the 
royal family have any special abilities, and their technology, save 
these treeships, is merely galaxy-standard. Any Hyurodan with a power 
gem can do amazing things, and our technology is more advanced.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s too bad it hasn&#39;t helped us,&quot; Ryoko snorted, dropping into 
a chair and sprawling out at it, endeavoring to look bored and mildly 
annoyed despite the comfort of her perch.

&quot;It is odd, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Washu frowned marginally, her voice turning 
thoughtful. &quot;The Juraians certainly seem populous and prosperous 
enough that they could support themselves, and with the Hyurodan 
advancements in energy crystal usage and technology, we should be 
flourishing and expanding at an almost alarming rate.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Alarming&#39;?&quot; Kallista raised one eyebrow.

&quot;Alarming if you&#39;re not a Hyurodan,&quot; Washu amended with a grin, before 
turning serious again. &quot;However, it&#39;s almost as if no matter what we 
could have done, the Juraians and the Hyurodan would have to come 
together for this alliance. A most peculiar occurrence of massive 
circumstance. I&#39;ll have to look into it.&quot;

&quot;Whatever, whatever,&quot; Ryoko said airily, waving a hand dismissively. 
&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter to me. I marry Miss Priss and proceed to live out my 
days in luxury in what&#39;s starting to sound like a self-contained 
paradise. The universe can attend to itself.&quot;

Riyata rose and took a slight step to the side, smoothly blocking 
Washu and Ryoko&#39;s view of Kallista&#39;s annoyed expression. &quot;I think I&#39;m 
gonna go take a look at the garden. Kallista, mind covering duty for 
me while I do?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; the orange-haired woman replied, having composed herself.

&quot;Be respectful to any trees,&quot; Washu advised brightly.

&quot;Very funny,&quot; Riyata grunted, rolling her eyes and heading for the 
door.

&quot;Who said I was joking?&quot;

Riyata paused in the doorway, then nodded once and resumed course. A 
few minutes walk brought her to the ship&#39;s personal garden, a slight 
dampness almost immediately settling on her skin. The black-haired 
guard blinked a little, then inhaled deeply. She&#39;d noticed that being 
aboard a Juraian treeship was unlike being on a normal ship or station 
in that the air was as fresh as on a planet, not recycled or pumped 
from cylinders. But here... here was the smell of plants and wet, rich 
earth that she hadn&#39;t smelled in decades. She&#39;d almost forgotten what 
it was like, on the damaged Hyurodan homeworld where the air, even in 
the castle&#39;s garden, had the tang and dry shock of the desert that 
surrounded it.

She glanced around briefly, finding herself feeling a little nervous, 
as if there might be a &#39;Do Not Walk On The Grass&#39; sign. When she 
realized what she was doing, she grumbled a little to herself and 
strode forward determinedly, then paused just to watch dew collecting 
on the metal of her boots.

The novelty wore off after a few minutes, but not the simple joy of 
being in a place that was so thoroughly alive, of looking up to see 
stars slip past above a canopy of leaves. Riyata walked more slowly as 
she wove between various sorts of trees, some of which she recognized, 
others that were completely foreign to her.

But as she approached a large pond which had its own small waterfall, 
she noticed that all the trees were of a sort she recognized... and 
what&#39;s more, they bore large, just-shy-of-ripe blurfruits, their color 
still a little bunched-together in places, red still close to red, 
green still close to green, the blue just starting to meander its way 
in amidst the other colors. A personal favorite of hers, as well as 
the exact stage she liked to eat them in, when they were still tart 
and the flavors not fully blended.

Again, she got that guilty feeling, like she was contemplating 
something she shouldn&#39;t do. After a moment, she shrugged it off, then 
paused before continuing. With a sort of half-serious embarrassment, 
she looked directly at one tree. &quot;I&#39;m just going to take one of these. 
... Respectfully, y&#39;know. Thanks.&quot;

She listened for a moment, as if for an answer, then made a face at 
herself when she realized what she was doing. Shrugging it off again, 
she reached her spear up and gave a blurfruit a good rap, careful to 
temper her strength so that it simply jarred from its stem and fell to 
her hand, rather than turning into a multicolored smear on a viewport. 
Catching it easily, she took a close look, making sure it wasn&#39;t some 
odd mutant sort (at least visibly), then raised it to her lips.

&quot;You didn&#39;t say please,&quot; came a lyrical voice almost directly in her 
ear.

Riyata immediately stepped forward and whirled at the same time, 
dropping the fruit to bring her spear into a guard position. She 
didn&#39;t know how someone had snuck up on her, but... they... hadn&#39;t? 
She blinked as she saw... well, nothing. The garden looked just as it 
had. She could faintly hear someone in the distance, but they sounded 
like they&#39;d just entered the garden from close to where she had... it 
couldn&#39;t have been them.

Suspiciously, she glanced down at the blurfruit, as if suspecting it 
of having made her hear things even though she&#39;d yet to so much as 
actually touch it with her teeth.

&quot;And that&#39;s really not very polite,&quot; came another almost musical 
admonishment, of a slightly different timbre, from the side this time.

Riyata whirled again, facing the pond, and again saw nothing. She 
scowled. Maybe some sort of pollen from one of the trees she didn&#39;t 
recognize.

&quot;So atone!&quot; This time, it was both voices together. Riyata whirled yet 
again, and this time was rewarded with the sight of two tall, 
near-identical Juraian women. In fact, only their hair and eye color 
distinguished them, the one on the right with blue hair tinted with 
purple and purple eyes with flecks of blue, the colors flip-flopped on 
the other. And it seemed that their ankle-length locks were the only 
thing they were wearing, other than the merry expressions on their 
face, since Riyata got quite an eyeful as each of them raised one leg 
and booted her into the pond.

The Hyurodan guardswoman *oomph*ed as she landed on her rump in the 
water, finding it to be only about a foot deep where she had landed. 
She sat there in a bit of shock, looking all around the shore for any 
sign of the women that she&#39;d seen. Instead, she saw the dark-skinned 
Juraian guard she&#39;d been coming to know the past few days, Mihoshi. 
Mihoshi was covering her mouth with one hand, though whether it was to 
cover dismay or amusement wasn&#39;t readily apparent.

&quot;I suppose you think this is funny?&quot; Riyata grumbled, taking a guess.

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Mihoshi replied hurriedly, laughter in her voice. 
Finally, she let her hand drop, revealing the bright smile she&#39;d been 
hiding. Still, there was just innocent amusement there... despite the 
laughter being due to Riyata&#39;s misfortune, there was such a lack of 
maliciousness there that Riyata nevertheless found herself soothed.

Mihoshi rounded the shore of the pond, to stand in front of Riyata. &quot;I 
guess the twins got you, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, looks like,&quot; Riyata murmured, looking down at herself, then 
looking up and blinking, something about the phrase &quot;the twins&quot; 
clicking in her mind. &quot;... Mizuho and Karin?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh. The garden&#39;s the only place they can manifest their, um... oh 
yeah, their spirit forms!&quot; Mihoshi nodded, looking a bit proud of 
herself for remembering the term. &quot;At least when they&#39;re in space like 
this. It&#39;s the only place where they can take on a human form and 
really interact, and they get pretty mischievious sometimes.&quot; Mihoshi 
glanced around, then leaned forward to whisper to Riyata, seeming 
undaunted by the fact that the beings she was trying to avoid being 
heard by comprised the whole of everything surrounding her. 
&quot;Personally, I think they get pretty mean sometimes.&quot;

As if to prove Mihoshi&#39;s point, the twins shimmered into being behind 
her and, moving in perfect concert and taking advantage of the 
maidservant&#39;s position while speaking to Riyata, each delivered a 
good, hearty slap to her buttocks. Mihoshi gave a yelp that must have 
been audible all over the ship and toppled forward, sending up a small 
geyser of water as she involuntarily bellyflopped into the pond.

Mihoshi gave a pitiful moan of anguish as she sat up, holding her 
hands out and watching her sleeves drip. &quot;I&#39;m weeeet!&quot;

Riyata felt something lurch inside her stomach, and a faint trembling 
began all throughout her body. For a small part of a second, she 
wondered if she were going to be sick. And then, she burst out 
laughing, putting one hand to her head and leaning back on the other.

Mihoshi jutted her lower lip out in a pout. &quot;Hey! It&#39;s not funny at 
all!&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is!&quot; Riyata howled, smacking a fist against the water, her 
shoulders shaking. &quot;It really, really is!&quot;

The blonde maidservant continued to pout, but slowly it faded away, 
and soon she was giggling, putting both hands over her mouth. Riyata&#39;s 
laughter began to trail off, and she smiled at Mihoshi, chuckles still 
rumbling in her throat. She realized with a shock that it was the 
first time she&#39;d laughed or even really smiled since Ada had died. 
That&#39;s why she&#39;d been so confused when she&#39;d felt it beginning... 
somehow, the grief had so consumed her that she&#39;d believed she could 
never be happy again, let alone sitting in a pond in the middle of 
space laughing.

Shaking her head, the smile refusing to leave her lips, and looked at 
Mihoshi. Again, realization hit like a blast of lightning over how 
beautiful she was. Smooth, dark skin, flower-yellow hair, eyes the 
color of the mildest, clearest skies, the drenched silk of her white 
kimono ever-so-faintly transparent and clinging to her breasts and 
stomach and legs. But this time, the sickness she felt almost 
immediately was real... how could she? She turned her head away, 
glowering. What kind of monster was she to look at another woman, when 
the woman she&#39;d loved was dead and in the ground, slipping ever 
further away with each second the ship was moving?

&quot;Um, Riyata,&quot; Mihoshi whispered, leaning forward and tilting her head, 
her own amusement having disappeared. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;... It&#39;s nothing, really.&quot;

&quot;But... you-&quot;

Whatever Mihoshi might have said in her attempt to comfort the other 
woman were cut off by the ship lurching abruptly. Mihoshi shrieked in 
surprise and fright as she was sent lurching forward, and Riyata 
instinctively grabbed for her, shoving the Juraian under herself and 
assuming a wolflike protiective stance on all fours in the water, one 
arm wrapped around Mihoshi and under her head to keep it above water, 
the other against the ground and gripping her spear.

&quot;We are under attack.&quot; Two voices speaking as one, filling the ship, 
impishness, laughter, and song gone from the tone. &quot;Repeat, we are 
under attack.&quot;
