<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 39 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch38.html">Back to Part 38</a><pre>Erica Tenoh leapt off the top of the crystal tower,
her pulse racing as the black haired woman fell. Her
casual clothes shimmered, darkness swirling around
her, then Tuxedo Kamen fell in her place. With a
astonishing ease she bounded off a wall then onto a
lower roof, leaping from building to building at great
speed.

&#39;This is SO much fun,&#39; Erica had to admit to herself
from behind her simple white mask, the black tuxedo
clinging to her body. &#39;I wonder if this is what it was
like for my parents when they first started out?&#39;

Some extra sense seemed to guide Tuxedo Kamen to a
certain street even as a alarmed cry rang out, &quot;Help,
thief!&quot;

Without thinking Tuxedo Kamen was off, leaping down
over a busy street as passerby watched her in
surprise. With a simple move she tripped her foe,
retreived the package and knocked out the lady thief
with one blow.

&quot;Oh thank you...&quot; the redheaded woman started to say
as she rushed up, only to trail off as she met Erica&#39;s
eyes beneath the mask.

&quot;Are you all right, miss?&quot; Erica asked as she handed
back the box with a smile.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; the slightly older woman managed, a bit of
red coloring her cheeks as her breathing seemed to
speed up.

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Erica smiled charmingly as she picked
up the thief. &quot;Excuse me, I must be going,&quot; and with
that she was off.

&quot;Thank you!&quot; the woman waved, stars in her eyes.
Watching Tuxedo Kamen go she sighed happily, &quot;What a
hunk!&quot;

First Tuxedo Kamen dropped the thief off at the police
station and swore out a complaint, then she headed out
to try and complete the errand she had went out for in
the first place. The training center for hardsuits
took her only a few more minutes to reach, despite
being miles away on the outer edge of sprawling
Crystal Tokyo.

&quot;About time you got here,&quot; Ran Mizuno called from
where she stood at the armored main gate of the
facility, the dark blue haired young woman dressed in
the simple one-piece jumpsuit of the Earth Self
Defense Force.

&quot;I ran into a mugger on the way here,&quot; Erica shrugged.
She frowned as they did the check in then went inside,
&quot;I don&#39;t understand why someone would want to be a
thief, work is always available if they want it...&quot;

Ran gave her friend a wry smile as they passed the
front desk, several officers nodding hello as well as
staring at the tuxedo clad woman covertly, &quot;Sadly,
some people just don&#39;t want to do real work.&quot; A pause,
&quot;And you have to admit, the city sponsored gardening
and public works jobs aren&#39;t thrilling.&quot;

&quot;Better than going to jail for stealing,&quot; Erica said
with a shake of her head. She looked over at Ran, &quot;So,
what&#39;s the surprise you said you had for me?&quot;

Ran gave her friend a sly look as they turned down a
long hallway, the walls a soft metallic green, &quot;You
were interested in trying some combat training?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Erica looked at her friend warily.

Ran laughed impishly, &quot;Not THAT bad. I just got some
volunteers together to put you through your paces.&quot;

&quot;Live weapons?&quot; Erica asked after a moment&#39;s thought.

&quot;Just stun charges,&quot; Ran said seriously, &quot;though they
will hurt like hell if they hit you.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; a slow smile spread across her lips as Erica
said, &quot;sounds like fun.&quot;

&quot;Occasionally,&quot; Ran remarked as they reached the end
of the hallway and the armored door of a training
enclosure, &quot;you remind me a bit too much of Sailor
Uranus.&quot;

Erica grinned, &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a compliment.&quot;

Inside the room was a simulated field, the ground
rough and uneven and providing little cover. Three
hardsuits waited for her, visors down concealing the
pilots faces and the markings on the suits marking
them as trainees. Despite being trainer suits they
looked sleek and deadly, with fully functioning
strength augmentation, flight and onboard weapons
systems.

&quot;You ready?&quot; Ran called to her pilots a she walked
over to a elevator in the wall, leading up to a
observation bubble above them.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; the male voice came from a red striped,
blue colored suit, while women chimed in from the
green and gold suit and the black and silver one.

From within her cape Erica drew forth an opera cane,
spinning it casually as she called up the training she
had been doing the last while with Makoto. &quot;So,&quot; she
asked with a false sort of casualness, &quot;is there a
surrender phrase?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s keep it traditional,&quot; Ran said with a chuckle
as she opened the elevator and stepped inside, &quot;you
cry Uncle, you&#39;re done.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t hear that coming from us,&quot; the blue
hardsuit pilot purred, crouching down a bit in
readiness.

&quot;Never say never,&quot; Erica flashed a charming smile.

&quot;Recorders on,&quot; Ran announced from the observation
bubble, &quot;go!&quot;

Erica moved like a shot, cane swinging faster than the
eye could see as she struck the cocky young man first.
He flew back in a explosion of force, the outer shell
of his hardsuit actually cracking under the power of
her strike.

&quot;Holy...&quot; the black hardsuit hissed in shock.

Before her other two foes could react Erica spun
around and leapt at them, rolling beneath a hastily
fired off shot to drive her foot into the mid-section
of the green and gold suit and hammering it up against
the outer wall with a loud clang.

Surprisingly the pilot shook off the blow as she
hissed, &quot;Not bad.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Erica smiled as she saw the other suit
take to the air to try to gain the advantage of the
high ground, so to speak. &#39;Too bad it isn&#39;t going to
help,&#39; she grinned as she extended the length of her
cane.

&quot;What the...?&quot; the black hardsuit exclaimed as Erica
pole vaulted up to her and delivered a devastating
hit.

The suit crashed to the ground as Erica landed
lightly, cane back to normal size once more. Her cape
swirled around her as she smiled, looking at the two
standing figures and the one now stunned on the
ground. &quot;Well,&quot; she took up a battle stance, &quot;shall we
continue?&quot;

Later that afternoon Ran was grinning as a visibly
sore Erica got out of the shower. &quot;Regretting getting
cocky?&quot; Ran asked as she handed her a towel.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Erica took the towel, wincing a bit as she
dried off. &quot;Considering it was three against one, I
think I did pretty well,&quot; she smiled with some
satisfaction.

Ran smiled wryly, &quot;To be honest I expected them to do
a bit better, considering they&#39;re my top three
students right now.&quot;

&quot;So who were they?&quot; Erica asked as she pulled on a
spare jumpsuit, the dark green cloth clinging to her
slightly damp body.

&quot;Come on, they&#39;ll want to see you,&quot; Ran paused,
&quot;Tuxedo Kamen.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; Erica paused before willing the
transformation to take place, her formally soiled
costume reappearing spotlessly clean.

They strode down the hallway together, Ran leading the
way to the door to the break room. &quot;Brace yourself,&quot;
she warned.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Erica blinked as the door opened.

Two strangers looked up from where they were resting
while very familiar eyes looked up to meet Erica&#39;s
gaze. &quot;Hello, Kamen-sama,&quot; Catrine smiled sweetly,
still dressed in the one-piece under suit for her
armor.

&quot;Ran...&quot; Erica growled on realizing she had made her
unknowingly fight her girlfriend.</pre>
