<h1>Conquest (part 8 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The party had been going on for over an hour, and it didn&#39;t look like 
it was going to be winding down any time soon. Half nude dancing girls 
were paired up with many of the ladies and gents, a few actually 
dancing up on the tables. The other tables were covered with food and 
drink, and a pile of unopened gifts sat nearby.

Minagi waved the sake bottle, &quot;So did we surprise you?&quot;

Ryouko laughed, toasting her sister with her own bottle. &quot;Considering 
you nearly got skewered, I&#39;d say yes,&quot; she grinned. When the lights 
came up she had been so startled her sword manifested, much to 
everyone&#39;s great amusement.

Looking almost like two elves Washu and Yume danced together slowly. 
The near immortal women clearly loved each other deeply, a life long 
pair. &#39;I hope Ayeka and I can be like that someday,&#39; Ryouko thought.

Nagi sauntered over to where they were standing, smiling as she 
grasped Minagi&#39;s arm, &quot;Can I take her away for a bit?&quot;

&quot;Go for it,&quot; Ryouko laughed. Nagi barely gave Minagi a chance to put 
her bottle of booze down before pulling her into a tight clinch. They 
kissed deeply, much to the blushing Minagi&#39;s embarrassment.

The two had met when Nagi showed up after the bounty the Galaxy Police 
put on Ryouko&#39;s head, mistaking Minagi for her. They straightened that 
out, and found themselves deeply attracted to each other. After being 
in a state of serious denial about it for a few months, they finally 
accepted that they belonged together.

&quot;Would you like to have another drink?&quot; Ryouko heard a voice ask from 
right beside where she was sitting.

She turned to see a scantily clad serving girl standing there, her 
costume consisting of a few artistically placed straps of leather and 
not very much else. She bent over with the urn of wine she carried, 
high lighting her many charms. Not that long ago, Ryouko might have 
been tempted by her, but not any more.

&#39;Guess I&#39;m really hung up on Ayeka,&#39; she thought to herself ruefully. 
Aloud, Ryouko said to her gently, &quot;No, thank you.&quot;

The girl gave a disappointed pout, and slinked off, her bottom 
swaying.

There was a sound from up on the improvised stage, and Ryouko felt her 
stomach drop as she saw that her mother was standing up there with 
Yume, grinning from ear to ear. &#39;What is she up to now?&#39; she worried.

&quot;All right everybody,&quot; Washu grinned, &quot;it&#39;s time for the real fun to 
begin!&quot; A screen activated behind her, and a image formed.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Ryouko whispered.

Ryouko as a child stood there, looking quite abashed. A blanket with a 
large wet stain on it hung over a line nearby. &quot;I bet you all didn&#39;t 
know Ryouko had a bed wetting problem,&quot; Washu grinned at them 
maniacally.

Minagi was snickering softly, and Ryouko shot her a glare. Minagi just 
grinned back, &quot;Hey, you laughed when she did it to me.&quot;

&quot;If I knew she was going to dig that up, I&#39;d have destroyed all the 
files,&quot; Ryouko said with a soft groan.

&quot;And now for the past girlfriends!&quot; Yume spoke up as Washu hit another 
switch, and the torture continued...



Ayeka blushed fiercely as she opened up the first gift. Her co-mother 
Misaki grinned at her as the box opened up, Ayeka took one look inside 
and then quickly stuffed the gift back in.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Sasami asked her eagerly.

She, Asashi, Funaho, and more than a few of Ayeka&#39;s closer friends 
from the noble families of Jurai all looked on curiously. Ayeka 
blushed brightly, reluctantly drawing out the x-rated lace number that 
her mother had bought her.

&quot;Wear it on your wedding night,&quot; Misaki smirked.

Funaho grinned as Ayeka blushed even brighter. &quot;I think it will almost 
certainly make Ryouko happy to see you,&quot; she also smirked. 
Thoughtfully, she then added, &quot;Of course, being totally nude is always 
good, too...&quot;

&quot;Why weren&#39;t you saying that when we were discussing the ceremony?&quot; 
Misaki asked.

&quot;Mothers!&quot; Ayeka protested, looking over at Sasami and Asashi in 
concern.

Asashi sighed, &quot;Guess I shouldn&#39;t tell her what&#39;s in my gift.&quot;

&quot;Me, either,&quot; Sasami agreed.

Ayeka looked in surprise at both younger girls, then she buried her 
face in her hands and groaned softly.

&quot;Drink this,&quot; Funaho passed her a glass of something that smelled 
quite potent, &quot;it&#39;ll probably help.&quot;

Ayeka downed it in one go, and her friend Rhione cheered her on, &quot;Way 
to go!&quot; The redhead sat down by Ayeka, &quot;So, have you two... done the 
deed, yet?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Ayeka looked shocked at the suggestion.

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Misaki murmured.

Rhione patted her on the shoulder, &quot;You always were an old fashioned 
girl.&quot; She took a drink, and with a devilish look asked, &quot;Are you two 
getting married in the Manticorian custom?&quot; Over Ayeka&#39;s growing 
protests she cheerfully explained to the eager crowd of young ladies, 
&quot;They marry in the nude, you know.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, they&#39;re just performing an simple exchange of vows,&quot; Funaho 
took mercy on the fiercely blushing Ayeka.

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Rhione smirked. She frowned slightly, then spoke more 
quietly, &quot;Ayeka, have you ever... at all?&quot;

Ayeka looked startled, &quot;I&#39;ve had experience.&quot;

&quot;What kind of experience?&quot; Misaki asked eagerly.

&quot;Sufficient experience,&quot; Ayeka said evasively.

Funaho had an odd look on her face. &quot;I don&#39;t mean childhood 
experimentation, or a bit of fumbling in the dark,&quot; she said, looking 
over at Ayeka worriedly, &quot;have you...&quot;

Ayeka spoke softly, admitting, &quot;No.&quot;

Her parents, as well as Rhione, were all looking at her oddly. &quot;But,&quot; 
Rhione said, &quot;you had plenty of chances, and not a few men or women 
panting after you.&quot;

&quot;Panting after wealth or power, you mean,&quot; Ayeka sighed. &quot;I learned to 
see the gold diggers fairly early on,&quot; she added.

&quot;A virgin bride,&quot; Misaki remarked, looking just a bit tipsy, &quot;I 
thought they were extinct.&quot;



Ryouko groaned softly, keeping her head down on the table.

&quot;And then there was Lum,&quot; Washu grinned, &quot;but she insisted on their 
getting married immediately. I understand that her people, the Oni, 
are all still trying to track Ryouko down.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you had dated so much,&quot; Nagi remarked quietly.

Ryouko sighed, &quot;Youthful indiscretions.&quot;

&quot;Urd and Mara both dated her at the same time,&quot; Yume laughed, &quot;until 
they each found out about the other one. When the smoke finally 
cleared, Ryouko was gone and they were dating each other instead.&quot;

&quot;How much longer is this going to go on?&quot; Minagi asked from Ryouko&#39;s 
other side.

&quot;They&#39;re gonna run out of names pretty soon,&quot; Ryouko&#39;s voice was 
muffled by her being face down on the table.

&quot;Then she was taken captive by Usagi and her harem,&quot; Washu said as 
images of eight young women appeared on the screen, &quot;and she barely 
escaped before they killed her by exhaustion.&quot;

&quot;Be strong,&quot; Nagi patted Ryouko on the shoulder.

&quot;Myah,&quot; Ryo-ohki offered in sympathy. She was munching on a basket 
full of carrots, so it was a bit muffled, but it sounded sympathetic, 
any way.

&quot;And then there was her affair with Kiyone...&quot; Yume started.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Ryouko protested, &quot;I never had an affair with her!&quot;



Kiyone chuckled softly, watching the party on the bridge&#39;s monitor 
screen. Scattered around the bridge were Honor, Tita, Mihoshi and a 
few of the other fleet captains.

Yamamoto Yohko sighed softly, pushing her red hair back, &quot;I almost 
feel sorry for her.&quot; She paused, smiled, &quot;Almost.&quot;

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you down there?&quot; Tita asked Kiyone. You&#39;ve been serving in 
the fleet longer than any of us, and I know you were invited,&quot; she 
smiled.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t have been appropriate,&quot; Kiyone shook her head. &quot;I&#39;ll give 
her my best wishes on her wedding later, in private,&quot; she finished.

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Honor nodded. Her uniform was crisp and neat, though it 
was a bit spoiled by Michelle Henke hanging off her arm and Nimitz 
perched on her shoulder.

&quot;Bleek,&quot; the tree-cat chided them all.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Mihoshi said to them cheerfully, &quot;this way Kiyone and I can 
give Ryouko her special gift in private.&quot;

&quot;Special gift?&quot; Yohko asked.

Sounding quite perky, Mihoshi said, &quot;A deluxe trip for her and Ayeka 
to the Pleasure Planet for their honeymoon!&quot;

A moment of dead silence in the room...



Ayeka watched the party with a slightly tipsy smile on her face. 
Funaho and Masaki were cuddling together, the nobles were pairing up 
and dancing, and even Asashi and Sasami were sitting together, talking 
quietly.

&quot;I need some air,&quot; she sighed, and Ayeka slipped quietly out of the 
room. She walked down the halls, her steps eventually taking her to a 
view port.

&#39;This is where Ryouko and I talked,&#39; Ayeka remembered, &#39;and where she 
first asked me to marry her.&#39;

The planet of Jurai turned below them, and Ayeka gazed down at her 
home-world a little sadly. So much had happened to her in such a short 
time, she could hardly believe it. The conquest, a new Queen, the 
proposal, and then... falling for her.

Ayeka closed her eyes, and Ryouko&#39;s cat like eyes flashed in her mind, 
that saucy grin, and the silky mane of blue hair that she longed to 
run her fingers through. &#39;I just wish that I knew what she sees in 
me,&#39; she thought.

A figure slowly walked out of the shadows, and Ayeka blinked in 
surprise to see who she had been thinking of. &quot;Ryouko?&quot; she asked 
quietly.

Ryouko looked up, and her face lit up with a smile, &quot;Ayeka.&quot; She 
stepped up to stand beside her, and Ryouko&#39;s typically spicy scent 
surrounded them both.

&quot;You left your party, too?&quot; Ayeka asked. &quot;Or did it just run down?&quot; 
she added.

&quot;Nagi was about to do her striptease for us,&quot; Ryouko smiled wryly, 
&quot;and I figured that would be a bit much, even for me.&quot; She looked out 
at the planet that was slowly turning below, &quot;Jurai is such a 
beautiful world.&quot;

&quot;Is it very much different from Manticore?&quot; Ayeka asked.

&quot;Yes and no,&quot; Ryouko smiled. &quot;Manticore is more green, a wild place. 
We haven&#39;t chosen to disturb the forests much, it&#39;s a dangerous place, 
but also a beautiful one,&#39; she finished. She looked down at Ayeka, 
&quot;I&#39;m not describing it well, I think.&quot;

&quot;You love it, I can hear it in your voice,&quot; Ayeka said quietly. A 
pause, &quot;And beside you I&#39;m sure I could learn to love it, too.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have to live there,&quot; Ryouko said gently, &quot;we could settle 
just as easily on Jurai if you wish it.&quot;

Ayeka smiled up at her, a few tears glistening in her eyes. &quot;Thank 
you,&quot; Ayeka said, and slipped an arm around Ryouko&#39;s neck. She then 
drew her down gently into a very thorough, very vigorous kiss.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Ryouko murmured softly.

Ayeka smiled demurely, &quot;We&#39;ll decide where to live after the wedding, 
all right?&quot;

Ryouko said innocently, &quot;Yes, dear.&quot;

Ayeka batted her on the arm gently, and they shared a quiet laugh.
