<h1>Karaoke Songs</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Tenchi and the others followed Mihoshi and Kiyone to the doors of the 
Mitsuki Karaoke Bar. Outside a sign reading &quot;Family Night&quot; has been 
written on a white board in erasable marker. Several families walked 
in ahead of them and many more people, in groups and alone, were 
already inside. They saw a young woman already on stage singing a 
Britney Spears song. 

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s with the furry chick?&quot; Someone asked looking at Ryo-ohki. 

The cabbit girl was in her child form and smiled up at him cutely. 
&quot;Meow!&quot; 

&quot;She... uh... refuses to take off her Halloween costume.&quot; Tenchi said. 
&quot;You know kids.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, got a couple of them myself.&quot; The guy said and wandered off. 

Kiyone led them to a booth in the back corner. &quot;This is where Mihoshi 
and I usually drink.&quot; 

&quot;Cause you&#39;re afraid of people seeing how you act when you get drunk.&quot; 
Mihoshi laughed. Kiyone blushed and the blond hooked an arm around her 
waist. &quot;Oh come on Kiyone.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Kiyone said. &quot;I know I promised not to be embarassed but...&quot; 

&quot;I know.&quot; Mihoshi leaned onto her shoulder. Kiyone reached down and 
squeezed her hand. 

&quot;Aw! That&#39;s so romantic!&quot; Sasami said. 

Tenchi and the others blushed. Finaly Washu said, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s order 
some food and then decide who&#39;s going to sing what.&quot; 

Everyone held up the pieces of paper they were holding. Each of them 
had written their own, except for Tenchi who had sworn he was just 
going to watch. 

&quot;I want to go last.&quot; Sasami said. &quot;I mean I don&#39;t even know if I can 
do it...&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s okay Sasami.&quot; Aeka said. She glanced at Tenchi. &quot;I want to go 
first.&quot; 

&quot;Fine, then I&#39;ll go second.&quot; Ryoko added quickly. 

&quot;Meow!&quot; Ryo-ohki said quickly. Everyone looked at her and she waved 
her paper. Ryoko picked it up and looked at it. Then snickering she 
handed it back. 

&quot;What was that?&quot; Sasami asked. 

&quot;She&#39;s doing a parody called Cabbit Paradise. She&#39;s been into Weird Al 
lately. It&#39;s a rap song.&quot; Ryoko said with a grin. &quot;Too bad you guys 
won&#39;t understand it. She wants to go first, if that&#39;s alright with 
Aeka.&quot; 

&quot;Oh... well okay.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;But then me.&quot; 

&quot;Fine then I&#39;ll go fourth.&quot; Washu said. 

&quot;And we&#39;ll do one together.&quot; Mihoshi finished. 

Kiyone nodded, &quot;We always stink when we don&#39;t sing together.&quot; She 
waved a waiter over. &quot;Taku, can you take our order?&quot; 

&quot;Sure thing Kiyone.&quot; The waiter said. He came over quickly and wrote 
down what they wanted, then disappeared. 

&quot;So Ryo-ohki, do you want to eat first or sing?&quot; Tenchi asked. 

Ryo-ohki hopped out of her seat and crawled under the table. &quot;Myah.&quot; 

&quot;She doesn&#39;t want to risk getting anything in her fur.&quot; Ryoko said. 

The girl onstage finished singing just as Ryo-ohki arrived. The DJ 
handed her a microphone and the cabbit-girl took the stage. She handed 
the DJ a piece of paper and the music to Coolio&#39;s Ganster Paradise 
began to fill the room. 

(The words sung here are translated for the benifit of the reader. The 
cast and audience at the bar clapped their hands along with a whole 
lot of &quot;Meow&quot;.) 

As I walk through the valley where I spend most of my day, 
I take a look around and don&#39;t know what to say. 
But that&#39;s just perfect for a girl like me, 
Cause I can&#39;t utter an understandable word anyway. 
At 4:30 in the morning I&#39;m fast asleep, 
Sasami&#39;s in the kitchen and Ryoko&#39;s floating over Tenchi not making a 
peep. Fool. 
And we&#39;ve been listening to Washu cackle so long, that even Aeka 
thinks that her mind is gone. 
Yosho&#39;s a man of the land, 
He&#39;s into disapline. 
Got a wooden sword in his hand and wrinkles on his chin. 
But when Tenchi has to do his chores and you have to do mine, I&#39;ll be 
partying like it&#39;s twenty twenty nine. 
I&#39;ve been spendin&#39; most my life livin&#39; in a Cabbit&#39;s Paradise. I&#39;m 
treated very nice, livin&#39; in a Cabbit Paradise.It&#39;s no work or 
sacrifice livin&#39; in this Cabbit Paradise. Mihoshi and Kiyone work at 
discount price, while I&#39;m in a Cabbit Paradise. 
Kagato kicked me in the butt one week, but I meowed at him and turned 
the other cheek. I really didn&#39;t care, in fact I wished him well, 
cause I knew one of these days he&#39;d be burning in hell. 
But I&#39;ve killed a few people who didn&#39;t deserve it, 
A &#39;tude with me? You know that&#39;s unheard of. 
I never wear clothes but I make a cute hat, and my homies agree, I 
look cute like that. Fool. 
If you&#39;d come to visit you&#39;d have been bored to tears, 
I was at the bottom of a lake for seven hundred years. 
But I ain&#39;t really quaint so please don&#39;t point and stare, 
I&#39;m just a little vocally impaired. 
There&#39;s no &quot;Hi&quot; no &quot;Hello&quot; no &quot;Shut up you&#39;re annoying me&quot;, 
Like a mime on the street I&#39;m as quiet as can be. 
I&#39;ve been spendin&#39; most my life, livin&#39; in a Cabbit Paradise. 
With some weird and bizzare guys I&#39;m livin in a Cabbit Paraside. 
I&#39;ve got time for sin and vice livin in a Cabbit Paradise, 
While Ryoko and Aeka fight I play nice, livin&#39; in a Cabbit Paradise. 
Tenchi raises carrots, for me and no other, 
Ate a basket on Monday, soon I&#39;ll eat another. 
Think you&#39;re really cute? Think you&#39;re a star? 
Well I know I&#39;m a million times as cute as you are. I&#39;m the cutest 
girl, that you all want to be. On your knees day and night, getting 
pet for my whole life. 
So don&#39;t be cruel, and stop being whiny, 
Or else my sister I may have to put my foot up your hiney. 
We&#39;ve been spendin most our lives livin&#39; in a Cabbit Paradise, 
We&#39;re all after Tenchi at night livin&#39; in a Cabbit Paradise. 
Even the cops I&#39;m with are way too nice, 
But you&#39;d probably think it bites, cause it&#39;s just a Cabbit&#39;s 
Paradise. 

Ryo-hki handed the microphone off to the DJ and quickly walked back to 
the table. Washu and Ryoko were still laughing while everyone else 
busily assured her that while they couldn&#39;t understand her it had 
sounded very nice. At the same time their food arrived and Aeka 
aparently decided to sing after she ate. 

&quot;So what are the names of the songs you guys picked? Do they go with 
any music I&#39;ve heard?&quot; Tenchi asked. 

All the girls shook their heads. Washu said, &quot;I actually made each of 
them a tape of their own music.&quot; In other words the author doesn&#39;t 
know how to write actual music so you get to make your own up. &quot;My 
song is called Time Passed Me By.&quot; 

&quot;Well mine is called Broken Heart.&quot; Aeka said. 

&quot;You opened my eyes.&quot; Ryoko mumbled. 

&quot;I called mine Shadows and Light.&quot; Sasami said smiling. 

Mihoshi grinned. &quot;We&#39;re doing I&#39;ll Love You Forever.&quot; 

Kiyone was eating but she noticed Tenchi shoot her an understanding 
look. Neither of them had what you&#39;d call a normal relationship. 
Still... he glanced at Ryoko and Kiyone glanced at Mihoshi, then they 
looked at each other again and smiled. Things could be worse right? 

Aeika cleard her throat and stood up. She was sitting on the outside 
of the booth so nobody had to move. The man singing a Cher song still 
had a minute left and she was forced to stand there waiting for her 
turn. 

Finally it was her turn. She handed her tape to the DJ and took the 
stage. &quot;This song is to... a very good friend of mine.&quot; She was 
looking at Tenchi with a serene smile on her face. The music began and 
so did she. 

Destiny came for me, I know it&#39;s true. 
I said I gave my heart to you, 
But we both knew it was a lie. 
My love was never meant to be, 
I&#39;ll have to wait until the time is right for me. 
I look at you, 
You look away. 
I wanted to tell you but I couldn&#39;t find the words. 
Maybe I lost the fight, but it&#39;s so much better this way. 
Friends came from grief and even though I didn&#39;t win my broken heart 
has already begun to mend! 
Destiny has come for me. 

Closing her eyes Aeka took a deep breath and left the stage. Ryoko was 
already up and passing her, having phased through the table. As she 
passed the princess both of them stopped for a moment. They shook 
hands and without a word both of them continued on their way. 

Ryoko snatched up the microphone and tossed her tape to the DJ. Taking 
the stage she turned and stared out at the audience, her fangs 
flashing in the light. Without introduction she hummed deep in her 
throat and closed her eyes... and the words came. Tenchi listened to 
the music and for some reason it reminded him of hsi father&#39;s movies. 

Before I met you my eyes were closed, to all the pain I&#39;d see. 
Who cared what I did to them, all that counts it me. 
Now I don&#39;t know what to say, where to turn, to whom to pray. 
But when you opened my eyes... All that I can see is you and all I 
care about is what you do. 
Hold me close don&#39;t let me go, hold me tight and you will know, all I 
care about is you. 
My heart beats for you. Every breath I take every move I make, I make 
because our love is true. You opened my eyes. 
Your face is all I ever want to see. I close my eyes and I can feel 
you next to me. Warm in the dark. Always by my side. I don&#39;t need to 
run or find a place to hide. 
The day we kissed my heart beat in my chest. I closed my eyes and 
could only hope for the best. Then we touched and you did more than 
words could ever say. 
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this. Taking for granted 
that they&#39;re receive that magic kiss. I never thought I&#39;d see the day, 
that you&#39;d be by my side. 
Now in this moment, 
We stand as one, 
I want to take you to the stars and have a little fun. 
Kiss my way, up your leg, then do things to make you pant and make you 
beg. I&#39;ll touch your... 

Ryoko was cut off by a bunch of cheering coming from the booth where 
the others were. Opening her eyes she saw Tenchi and the others giving 
a standing ovation as loud as they could. The rest of the audience, 
particularly those with kids, were simply glaring at her. Blushing a 
bit Ryoko said, &quot;I wasn&#39;t done...&quot; She caught Tenchi&#39;s eyes. &quot;But I 
can always finish it later tonight.&quot; 

With a smirk to show she didn&#39;t regret a thing she laughed and stepped 
down from the stage. 

&quot;Ryoko, what were you thinking?&quot; Aeka asked as she got back to the 
booth. &quot;There are children here.&quot; 

&quot;Hey they got to grow up some time.&quot; Ryoko said with a grin. &quot;Besides 
you probably don&#39;t even know what I was going to say princess.&quot; 

&quot;I can guess.&quot; Aeka hissed. &quot;You were trying to embarass us.&quot; 

Ryoko pulled out her crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Aeka. 
&quot;Tell me what on there would be embarassing.&quot; 

Aeka sneered and looked down at the paper. For a moment the sneer 
stayed where it was and then her jaw dropped. Asher eyes scanned the 
paper Aeka&#39;s mouth began to open and close like a fish out of its 
bowl. 

Next to her Tenchi peeked over her shoulder and began reading. A drop 
of blood hit the table seconds later. Mihoshi leaned over for a look 
and said, &quot;I&#39;ve done that.&quot; 

&quot;Can I see?&quot; Sasami asked. 

&quot;No!&quot; Everyone at the table screamed and the paper was quickly shoved 
back into Ryoko&#39;s hand as she grinned like a cat who had not only 
eaten a canary, but had three more in a corner. 

&quot;Well... I&#39;m next.&quot; Washu said quickly. 

She walked up and the DJ was surprised when his equipment began 
playing by itself. With a wink to the crowd she snapped her fingers 
and was suddenly in a skin tight green dress and similar green 
lipstick. 

&quot;Hello ladies and gentlemen... and children of all ages.&quot; She smiled 
at a group of rugrats seated near the front. &quot;Are you ready for a good 
time?&quot; The crowd cheered. &quot;Well in that case, let&#39;s get started!&quot; 
Lights began to dance and circle around her. Her hips shaking with the 
loud music Washu opened her mouth. 

Off to the side the DJ had just enough time to say, &quot;But we don&#39;t have 
any lasers!&quot; 

Time passed me by, 
It left me where I lay. 
But how could I complain when I&#39;m the one who tried to blow up the 
universe? 
You want the best, you gotta give the best. Without sleep and never 
ever rest. 
Stars blazing mega bright, hit me with the cosmic light, dancing in a 
technicolor swirl. Shake it out, take it in, do it all over again, 
give the galaxy an extra whirl. 
Time bending moving fast, 
Five thousand years can pass, 
In a blink if you&#39;re that kind of girl. 
Sleep it off and breathe the air, 
Who am I to judge what&#39;s fair? 
I&#39;m just going to give it one more twirl. 
Time is ticking to the last, 
Who needs to teach the senior class? 
The principle can suck the grass, 
I&#39;ve got things I&#39;d rather do today. 
Blow it up and then repair, see what I can take and share, just to see 
if I can have some fun. 
Who cares if I make mistakes, evaporate a few lakes, reverse some 
genes, or implode a sun? 
Love is fine for those with time, I have things I need to do and even 
if it&#39;s just for you, even if it&#39;s mine. I&#39;ve some catching up to do. 
Electricity&#39;s a toy for me, I can remodel your tv to pick up shows 
from other worlds. If you need to blow your hair, want a brand new 
hover chair, or just want to attract the right girl. I can build it, I 
can mix it, if it&#39;s broken I can fix it, and I&#39;ll add something while 
I&#39;m there. 
Because I&#39;m behind and I need somthing to keep the boredom from my 
mind and I really can&#39;t just sleep. Stars flashing in the night, 
what&#39;s mine is mine, who cares whats right? I&#39;ll do what I want and 
where! 

Washu ended her song by bursting into a loud laugh that echoed through 
the room. Several of the kids int he audience began to cry and parents 
called for her to get off the stage. Still laughing Washu made her way 
over to her friends. 

The DJ stood up, finally back in control. &quot;Okay, how about we get a 
kid up here now? Come on!&quot; 

&quot;Can I go up early?&quot; Sasami asked. The others nodded and Sasami made 
her way up to the front. 

&quot;And what&#39;s your name little girl?&quot; 

&quot;Sasami.&quot; She said sheepishly. 

&quot;Sasami? Well that&#39;s a pretty name. Now do you have a song for us?&quot; 

Sasami nodded, blushing furiously, and handed him her tape. He gave 
her the microphone and the audience cheered. Sasami just stared at all 
of them for a moment and then began to sing, unsteadily at first, but 
with growing enthusiasm. 

Shadows and darkness. Stars and light. My sister to tuck me in at 
night. 
Conforting me, 
Brining dreams to my sleep. 
Letting all the others know that I won&#39;t make a peep. 
My friends and family care about the person inside of me. They love 
and protect me from the worst things in my life. Nightmares fade away 
when I think of them. 
Shadows and darkness, stars and light, 
Thanks to them there&#39;s nothing bad in sight. 

Looking a little embarassed Sasami bowed and quickly got down. 
Everyone in the room applauded so much it was almost deafening. 
Mihoshi and Kiyone were waiting for her just off the stage. 

&quot;Great song Sasami.&quot; Mihoshi said. 

&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t know if we can top it.&quot; Kiyone put in. 

Sasami hugged them and quickly ran back to the booth. On stage the DJ 
came up once more. &quot;Well folks it&#39;s family night and we know you 
parents have an early bed time.&quot; The children laughed. &quot;So we&#39;re 
having one special treat for all of you before you leave. Individualy 
they hold the record for the lowest scores and together the highest. 
The Mitsuki Bar&#39;s favorite duo. Mihoshi and Kiyone!&quot; 

The regular customers began clapping enthusiastically as Mihoshi and 
Kiyone stepped up to the mikes. 

Kiyone cleared her throat and said, &quot;We&#39;re going to do a song called 
I&#39;ll Love You Forever. Um... Mihoshi wrote the music... and I wrote 
the words.&quot;

Taking a sip of water she licked her lips, turned to her partner, and 
started the song. 

Kiyone: I&#39;ll love you forever 

Mihoshi: I&#39;ll hold your hand in mine 

Both: I&#39;ll keep you here beside me until the end of time. 

I&#39;ve loved you from the first time we met, thought I wouldn&#39;t allow my 
heart to say the words I hadn&#39;t wanted to admit. But here today we 
have our chance to let it all begin. 

Mihoshi: Looking in your eyes I see how much you care. I&#39;ve never 
wanted anything but to see myself reflected there. 

Kiyone: I held it back, I kept it deep inside. I knew how you felt but 
all I did was break your heart all over again. 

All that I can do is promise that I&#39;ll never hurt you now. 

Both: I&#39;ll love you forever. We&#39;ll never be apart. I know that we 
don&#39;t always get along but you&#39;ll always have my heart. For now and 
forever, through thick and thin. I&#39;ll love you forever and my love 
will never end. 

Kiyone: Embarassment and shame have no place with us 

Mihoshi: I knew that you wouldn&#39;t hurt me, because you have my trust. 

Kiyone: Together forever 

Mihoshi: No matter how far 

Both: I&#39;ll love you forever. I&#39;ll hold you close to me. And then when 
the time has come I think that you will see. I&#39;ll love you forever. 
I&#39;ll hold you in my heart and never let you leave. 

Kiyone: I love you 

Mihoshi: I love you 

Both: I&#39;m in love with you... 

The rugulars cheered. The people who had neverheard them before stared 
dumbfounded. The kids were split between clapping and saying &quot;Ick!&quot; 
Kiyone and Mihoshi bowed and the rest of the audience began to clap. 

Back at the booth Ryoko curled up against Tenchi&#39;s side, Washu, 
Ryo-ohki, and Sasami were each polishing off an ice cream sundae. Aeka 
was eating a cookie and argueing with Ryoko over Tenchi&#39;s head. 

&quot;Well my song was better than Ryoko&#39;s.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah right.&quot; Ryoko said, not looking over. &quot;If I&#39;d gotten to 
finish...&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;d have been thrown out and banned for life.&quot; Tenchi said. 

&quot;Just remember you promised to listen to the whole thing later 
Tenchi.&quot; 

&quot;Ryoko you shouldn&#39;t say such things in front of a member of the Jurai 
royal family.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll say what I like princess.&quot; 

And so on. Meanwhile Kiyone and Mihoshi sat on stools at the bar, 
looking around at the departing families. 

&quot;You know...&quot; Kiyone said. 

Mihoshi nodded. &quot;I know. It was hard for you. I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry if I 
pushed it Kiyone.&quot; 

Kiyone reached over and caressed her cheek. &quot;I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just sorry 
that was so hard to do in front of people. I just hope it gets 
easier.&quot; She leaned forward and kisses Mihoshi on the bottom lip. 

&quot;Practice makes perfect.&quot; Said the blond cheerfully. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s 
get back to the others before the place runs out of ice cream!&quot; 
Grabbing Kiyone&#39;s hand she jumped up and dragged her partner back to 
their friends. 

Author&#39;s note
