<h1>Mixed Up</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I hate her. So prim, prim proper. Watch her, just watch. Sitting 
underneath the shade of a tree with her little sister. Her sister&#146;s 
laughter, like bells and pretty things, lace and baby dolls.
 
Hers is like silk and fine wine, accentuated with the dim sound of a 
whip grazing over soft flesh.
 
I decide to make my appearance.
 
I see them both turn, and her sister&#146;s eyes brighten. &quot;Hello Ryoko!&quot;
 
Her face tenses, her smile fades away. &quot;Miss Ryoko,&quot; she says stiffly, 
grasping her sister&#146;s hand, &quot;Well, Sasami, I think it&#146;s about time we go 
back inside...&quot;
 
I grab her shoulder before she stands up. &quot;What&#146;s the rush, Princess? 
We&#146;re all buddies here, right?&quot; I wink at Sasami, and she giggles. Ayeka 
does not seem amused.
 
&quot;Miss Ryoko, we are NOT friends. You probably have something uncouth and 
sinister planned. Now, let me go!&quot;
 
Uncouth? Who in the hell says uncouth? Ahh, she&#146;s angry now. I like 
that. It dims the hate, makes it lust. Bloodlust, battle lust, or just 
lust in general, it doesn&#146;t matter.
 
&quot;Nope.&quot;
 
She snaps, wrenches herself from my grasp.
 
&quot;What is the matter with you?! Have you no class, no morals? Tenchi is 
not even around! Why do you feel the need to bother me ALL the time?!&quot;
 
Sasami winces, gently tugs on her enraged sister&#146;s kimono. &quot;Please 
Ayeka...&quot;
 
But oh, she isn&#146;t finished.
 
&quot;All I wanted to do today is spend time with my sister, and you ruin it! 
You...you ruin everything!&quot;
 
I can&#146;t help it. I laugh. I mean, It&#146;s funny, and cute. What can I say?
 
That does it. I have to say, ladies and gentlemen, I have never seen 
Ayeka so angry. I expect her to start throwing energy around, but...she 
doesn&#146;t. She says the worst thing that she can possibly say.
 
&quot;I hate you. I hate you Ryoko!&quot;
 
With that, she runs off, Sasami spares me a pitying glance, and follows 
after her.
 
Ouch.
 
See why I hate her? So fucking prim and proper, isn&#146;t she? Can&#146;t ever 
lower herself to my level huh? Fighting over that fucking pansy, but 
when it&#146;s all calm, she&#146;s as demure as can be.
 
Hate, love, all mixed up. I&#146;m all mixed up.
 
I hate the Princess Ayeka, but the warrior in her...
 
God, I love that.
 
But she hates me, she hates all of me. I wish I could change for her, 
but I can&#146;t.
 
I hate fighting over him, I hate fighting her. I hate myself.
 
I hate myself.
