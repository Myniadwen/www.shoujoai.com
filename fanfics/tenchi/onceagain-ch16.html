<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 16 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/onceagain-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Mutsumi Otohime knew she wasn&#39;t the sharpest person in the world, but 
she wasn&#39;t stupid either. The busty, brown haired woman might have 
lacked academic skills but she was good and getting better at reading 
people and understanding their motivations.

For instance Mutsumi had seen the stirring of attraction between her 
friends Motoko and Kitsune from almost as soon as she met the two of 
them. She was also aware of how the inn&#39;s manager Kanako was becoming 
more attracted to Motoko and how that might complicate the whole 
situation. She knew that Su was cheerfully omni-sexual and had 
considering jumping Shinobu, only holding off because of her friend&#39;s 
shyness. She watched the relationships and lives of everyone in the 
Hinata Inn and Dorm, and lately had spent even more time watching a 
certain recent arrival.

Tennyo Masaki was both a source of endless fascination for Mutsumi as 
well as great frustration. Almost as soon as she met the slim, white 
haired young woman she had felt a odd attraction to her, one that she 
was almost certain Tennyo returned. So why didn&#39;t the other woman do 
something?

After a few more days of feeding Tennyo at the Hinata Caf&eacute; and Mutsumi 
came to a certain revelation. Tennyo was, despite her occupation and 
sword skills, a shy woman. For whatever reason it seemed she was unable 
or unwilling to make the first more.

`Either that,&#39; Mutsumi thought wryly as she used a old fashioned broom 
swept up outside the caf&eacute;, `or Kitsune warned Tennyo off.&#39;

Mutsumi loved Kitsune like a brother, but the young woman was often 
overprotective. In fact Kitsune really did remind Mutsumi of a big 
brother, willing to stand up for her `little sisters&#39; but like a brother 
occasionally going a bit far. She had seen Kitsune take Tennyo aside 
with a serious expression on her face, and both of them had looked at 
her while trying to act like they weren&#39;t looking.

&quot;Hello, Mutsumi,&quot; Shinobu smiled up at her, the black haired girl 
carrying a basket of ingredients. Her eyes moved to Mutsumi&#39;s large 
breasts concealed behind her dress and apron, then she blushed and 
looked away.

`Poor thing,&#39; Mutsumi thought sympathetically as she picked up the 
leaves. The girl had been flat for years, but thankfully she was 
starting to fill out a bit. &quot;Back from shopping?&quot; she asked cheerfully, 
gesturing to offer to help carry.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Shinobu said as they started towards the caf&eacute;, both of them 
falling comfortably into step by long practice.

As Kitsune had divided her attention between managing the caf&eacute; and 
running her Phantom Quest Corps, she and Mitsumi had gradually come into 
more responsibilities in the caf&eacute;. Now, one would probably expect that 
as the elder Mutsumi would have put herself in charge, but she and 
Shinobu quickly realized that way lay disaster. Instead Mutsumi 
concentrated on her gifts, customer service and hosting the store while 
Shinobu handled some management jobs and cooked. It was a odd 
arrangement, certainly, but both found it quite satisfactory.

A faint blush colored Mutsumi&#39;s cheeks as she asked, &quot;Did you see Tennyo 
coming here on your way back?&quot;

Shinobu smiled back as she warmly answered, &quot;No, not yet. But we both 
know she can get pretty busy at her job.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Mutsumi admitted. She sometimes fretted over Tennyo&#39;s 
job, knowing the architect spent a lot of time in her office dealing 
with various people. She was sure some man or woman would see how good 
looking Tennyo was and start actively chasing her.

They entered the caf&eacute; together, the building deserted in the lag time 
between lunch and dinner. Shinobu headed for the kitchen as Mutsumi did 
a quick walk around, checking for anything out of place and generally 
tidying up. Meanwhile as Mutsumi cleaned Shinobu laid out the plan for 
tonight&#39;s meal then began to prepare the ingredients.

&quot;Do you think we can get Kitsune in here later to give you a break?&quot; 
Shinobu asked as she gracefully chopped vegetables.

Mutsumi gave her a thoughtful look, &quot;And why would we want her to do 
that?&quot;

Shinobu winked, &quot;Why, to give you a chance to eat with her, of course.&quot;

&quot;What is it with you and matchmaking?&quot; Mutsumi shook her head, 
chuckling. &quot;First Anthy, now me?&quot;

Shinobu smiled at her as she carefully separated out the vegetables for 
each dish. &quot;I like my friends to be happy,&quot; she explained, &quot;and I think 
Tennyo can do that for you.&quot;

Mutsumi felt choked up a bit as she reached over to pat the other 
woman&#39;s head. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she answered softly, &quot;but I think it&#39;ll 
happen in it&#39;s own time.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;ll happen?&quot; Kitsune asked as she strode inside, the slim boyish 
blonde smiling at them cheerfully.

&quot;Mutsumi finally asking Tennyo out to dinner,&quot; Shinobu said, giving her 
a look that was slightly scolding.

Kitsune looked just a bit sheepish, privately confirming to Mutsumi she 
had warned Tennyo off. &quot;You know, I like Tennyo a lot,&quot; Kitsune said as 
she walked by the tables towards them, &quot;but the woman&#39;s hiding 
something.&quot;

Mutsumi nodded slightly, acknowledging the point. For a person who 
claimed to be just a simple architect she knew a awful lot, including 
sword skills on the same level of the God&#39;s Cry school. She clearly had 
a very interesting past, and so far no one had wormed it out of her.

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Mutsumi looked at Kitsune with a slight smile, &quot;but I&#39;ve 
never pressed you about why you were living here as a author for years. 
Nor do I ask Anthy who she really is, too. If we extend those rights to 
you and her, why not Tennyo?&quot;

Kitsune smiled wryly, acknowledging the point. &quot;All right,&quot; she sighed, 
&quot;I guess I&#39;m just worried she&#39;ll hurt you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t we all take that chance?&quot; Mutsumi shrugged eloquently.

&quot;That we do,&quot; Shinobu agreed. She gave Kitsune a dangerous look, &quot;So no 
more interference from you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Kitsune nodded, chuckling softly.

As Shinobu turned back to the kitchen Mutsumi whispered, &quot;She can 
certainly be fierce.&quot;

:That she can,&quot; Kitsune agreed, &quot;she can back it up, too. She threatened 
me with stopping cooking once... it was terrible.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ll do it again, too,&quot; Shinobu laughed.

The evening crowd began to arrive, locals and guests of the area spas 
looking for dinner. Not long after Shinobu took over cooking word got 
around about how good the food was, and soon the caf&eacute; was filling to 
near capacity. Sometimes Mutsumi missed the intimacy of the old days, 
but on the other hand the extra money from the caf&eacute; came in handy.

Mutsumi was clearing a table when she heard the door open, looking up to 
see Tennyo Masaki walk in. Every time she saw her she was struck by her 
unusual attractiveness, her regal bearing and beauty. Long white hair 
shimmered down past her waist as she strode inside, her woman&#39;s business 
suit hugging her athletic body.

&quot;Tennyo,&quot; Mutsumi smiled as she walked up, her briefcase held in one 
hand.

&quot;Evening,&quot; Tennyo smiled back, adding &quot;you look nice in that dress, 
Mutsumi.&quot;

Mutsumi felt herself blush at that casual compliment, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Looking out from the kitchen Shinobu called, &quot;Do you want your regular?&quot;

Tennyo smiled as she said, &quot;Yes, please.&quot;

Kitsune cleared her throat, &quot;If you want, you can take a break Mutsumi.&quot;

`Oh, very subtle,&#39; Mutsumi fought back a chuckle. &quot;I&#39;m going on my 
dinner break,&quot; she told Tennyo, &quot;would you mind if I join you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Tennyo answered as they moved off together, walking to 
the corner table usually reserved for staff. &quot;Here,&quot; she pulled out a 
chair for Mutsumi.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mutsumi blushed again as Tennyo pushed the chair in for 
her.

&quot;She&#39;s certainly a charmer,&quot; Kitsune admitted as she picked up the food 
from Shinobu.

&quot;That she is,&quot; Shinobu agreed as she watched the two beginning to talk.</pre>
