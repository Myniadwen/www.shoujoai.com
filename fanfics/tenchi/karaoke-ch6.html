------------------------------------------------------------ 

Ryoko laughed and did another back flip in the air. &quot;Yahoo!&quot; 

Tenchi meanwhile was simply sitting on the steps leading up to the 
shrine, watching her. It took him a moment to notice Noboyuki sitting 
next to him. 

&quot;So you&#39;re going on the trip now?&quot; Noboyuki asked. 

Tenchi nodded. &quot;Yeah. I finished school a month ago and I did promise 
her.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re going to ask her to marry you aren&#39;t you?&quot; 

Tenchi looked at his father startled. &quot;How did you-?&quot; 

&quot;I knew you would Tenchi. You look at her like I used to look at your 
mother.&quot; He put a hand on Tenchi&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you 
Tenchi... and not just because you could technically take over the 
universe any time you want.&quot; 

Tenchi grinned at his dad. &quot;Thanks... but I wasn&#39;t just going to ask 
her to marry me. I was... well I was thinking of taking this chance to 
elope.&quot; 

Noboyuki raised an eyebrow. &quot;Are you sure? The girls would...&quot; 

&quot;Dad, I know what the girls would do. If they want we can redo it when 
we get back with the whole ceremony.&quot; 

&quot;Does Ryoko know about this plan of yours?&quot; 

&quot;No, I kept it to myself. Washu is putting the final touches on the 
ship. She says we can leave in two hours. When she&#39;s done we&#39;ll be 
able to go.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re not taking Ryo-ohki?&quot; Noboyuki was surprised. 

&quot;No... I don&#39;t think we could stand taking her away from Sasami. 
Besides neither of us thinks this trip needs an audience... so you can 
forget the idea of me taking the video camera.&quot; 

&quot;Please!&quot; Noboyuki begged. &quot;Even if you don&#39;t get the good stuff, I&#39;d 
still like to see you guys on your vacation.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry dad. I&#39;m sure Washu has it covered.&quot; 

They both looked up as Ryoko let out another scream of joy. 

&quot;Dad and I are going to take Sasami to that theme park she wanted see 
for a week. We&#39;re leaving in a bit too.&quot; Noboyuki said. 

&quot;What about Aeka?&quot; 

&quot;She said she was going to stay and help Washu with some experiments.&quot; 
Standing up Noboyuki added, &quot;You have fun Tenchi. I want to be a 
grandfather.&quot; 

&quot;Dad,&quot; Tenchi groaned. 

Kiyone finished typing up her report, then pushed the button that 
transferred it to the Yagami and through it&#39;s computer to 
headquarters. In the time since she and Mihoshi had become more than 
merely partners in the police force, she&#39;d relaxed somewhat. Instead 
of working herself to death all the time, she did only exactly what 
was required for someone in her position. But just the same she did 
make sure to do EXACTLY what she needed to. Taking special care to 
check all the regulations on personal relationships between officers. 

That was why she was so surprised when her watch beeped and the 
holographic display showed that they were being ordered to return to 
headquarters to answer charges of improper conduct involving each 
other. When she told Mihoshi the blond was not pleased. 

&quot;But... but how can they do this?&quot; Mihoshi asked. &quot;I thought you took 
care of everything.&quot; 

&quot;I did.&quot; Kiyone said. &quot;There must have been a clerical error. I went 
over it twelve times and made sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes.&quot; 

&quot;Well does it say who leveled the charges?&quot; Mihoshi asked. Somehow 
Kiyone could have sworn there was a threat in her voice, but when she 
caught her partner&#39;s eyes they were the same as ever and she just 
looked worried. 

&quot;No, it says the details will be given to us when we arrive.&quot; She took 
a deep breath. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Mihoshi. We&#39;ll get this cleared up quickly 
and things will slip right back to normal.&quot; 

&quot;Okay Kiyone.&quot; Mihoshi said cheerfully, all worry draining from her 
face. &quot;I believe you.&quot; 

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go tell the others.&quot; 

Aeka sat next to Sasami and Ryo-ohki on the couch while Kiyone 
explained what was going on. 

&quot;I don&#39;t see why they get involved in the first place.&quot; Ryoko said. 

&quot;Yeah I mean... isn&#39;t it your business?&quot; Tenchi put in. 

Kiyone shook her head. &quot;No, it makes sense Tenchi. As officers we&#39;re 
in a highly dangerous position. If working with someone you care that 
much about jeopardizes the work it also puts people in danger. 
Distractions at the wrong moment can mean terrible consequences.&quot; She 
glanced at Mihoshi who was looking at a small rainbow being reflected 
from a prism over the door and not listening to the word. The others 
all sweat dropped. &quot;Anyway the point is there are reasons for this and 
we need to get it cleared up.&quot; 

&quot;What happens if they don&#39;t?&quot; Sasami asked. 

Kiyone shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t think of any reason why they should, 
but there are a few possibilities. They could fire us and we would no 
longer be police officers. Two new people would be assigned to this 
sector and as Earth is protected we would no longer be able to enter 
the Solar System.&quot; 

&quot;I believe allowances can be arranged.&quot; Aeka said. 

Kiyone smiled. &quot;Thanks Aeka. But there are other possibilities. They 
may decide to assign us to different partners... possibly to new 
systems.&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Sasami said. &quot;You&#39;re part of our family.&quot; 

&quot;Well then we&#39;d better get going and arrange things.&quot; Kiyone said. 
&quot;Come on Mihoshi.&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mihoshi said and then stood up. &quot;Oh, sure Kiyone.&quot; She looked 
at Aeka. &quot;Tell Washu we said goodbye.&quot; 

&quot;Me?&quot; Aeka said. 

Kiyone and Mihoshi grinned at her blush, leaving no doubt that they 
knew something. &quot;Sure... why not? You seem to be helping her a lot 
lately.&quot; 

&quot;Oh... of... of course.&quot; Aeka said trying to regain her composure. 
&quot;Well it&#39;s something to do you know.&quot; 

&quot;We know.&quot; Kiyone and Mihoshi said in unison. 

Aeka managed to control herself. In addition to the other benefits, it 
took a lot more to embarrass Aeka these days than it used to. 
&quot;Certainly.&quot; Standing she walked towards the door. Meanwhile Tenchi 
and the others followed the two detectives out. 

&quot;Actually why don&#39;t we head out?&quot; Noboyuki said. &quot;Everything is 
packed.&quot; 

&quot;Then I will see you all later.&quot; Aeka said. She hugged Sasami and then 
turned towards the door to Washu&#39;s lab. 

Glancing at the door to Washu&#39;s lab Sasami saw Aeka enter and then 
close it. She&#39;d been disappointed when her sister had decided to stay 
behind instead of going on the trip with her. Still it was Aeka&#39;s 
decision and she had been spending a lot of time with Sasami lately. 
The little princess was just glad Aeka had stopped bothering about 
Tenchi and that Ryoko as leaving Ryo-ohki behind for the time they 
were leaving. 

Aeka walked quietly through the halls of Washu&#39;s lab. Usually when she 
came here the door led directly to wherever the scientist was. Lately 
however, she&#39;d been working on Ryoko and Tenchi&#39;s new spaceship. Aeka 
had begun to feel just a little bit neglected. 

Pausing Aeka realized she was lost. &quot;How does Mihoshi do it?&quot; Taking a 
deep breath to calm down, she picked a random direction and began 
walking. After all, if she didn&#39;t find Washu, eventually the scientist 
would simply find her. 

Nearly an hour later she saw a familiar red-haired shape appear out of 
the darkness. &quot;Washu!&quot; The figure turned and Aeka realized than it 
wasn&#39;t Washu. &quot;Oh, Mecha Washu, it&#39;s you. Do you know where Washu is?&quot; 

&quot;She is calibrating the engines in the new spaceship.&quot; The robot said. 
&quot;She will be busy for another .97 hours.&quot; 

Aeka sighed and looked around. &quot;She&#39;d always busy with that thing 
lately.&quot; Mecha Washu didn&#39;t respond. After a moment Aeka said 
something to break the silence. &quot;So what do you do here most days?&quot; 

&quot;Await instructions from mistress Washu.&quot; 

Aeka smiled and nodded. &quot;Oh yes, little Washu&#39;s orders are always 
worth waiting for.&quot; Suddenly an idea struck her. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose 
you&#39;d like to have a little fun while we wait.&quot; 

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that make Washu angry?&quot; Mecha Washu asked in a voice 
reminiscent of Mihoshi. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Aeka grinned wondering what her punishment might be for 
enjoying herself with Washu&#39;s favorite toy without her around. &quot;Do you 
mind?&quot; 

&quot;After my last upgrade I was told to follow the orders of the others 
in the house provided Washu isn&#39;t around.&quot; 

Aeka&#39;s smile almost covered the entire space between her ears. &quot;Then 
let&#39;s have a little fun.&quot; 

Washu smiled as she finished the last bit of the engines. With a push 
of a button she had it appear in the air over the house and teleport 
Tenchi and Ryoko aboard. Seconds later her scanners picked up the 
sounds of the engines kicking in and it was gone. 

&quot;Well that&#39;s done. Now to fine Aeka and see if she is up for a little 
fun.&quot; Turning she stepped through the door that appeared in front of 
her... and screamed. 

Aeka lay on the floor naked, her back a bloody mess of slashed skin. 
Mecha Washu stood over her holding a bloody yardstick. Washu 
recognized it as one she often employed when playing with Aeka. 

&quot;What have you done?&quot; Running passed the robot she knelt next to Aeka 
who moaned weakly. Washu heard one word whispered. 

&quot;Ramen.&quot; 

&quot;I simply did what she asked.&quot; Mecha Washu said. &quot;When she stopped 
screaming I was unsure if she was still conscious.&quot; 

Screaming, Washu thought. &quot;How... how long was this going on?&quot; 

&quot;.89 hours.&quot; Mecha Washu said. &quot;She arrived here alone and you were 
not around. The idea of using me seemed to make her happy even though 
I told her you would be angry.&quot; 

It would, Washu said to herself. Aeka would have probably gotten a 
thrill out of doing something like that. &quot;Did she... did she not ask 
you to stop? Did she want you to do this to her... this badly?&quot; Washu 
could feel the growing sense of guilt. She&#39;d started Aeka in the S&amp;M. 
It wasn&#39;t uncommon for people to become so addicted to pain that they 
went too far. Perhaps she&#39;d trusted Aeka too much for someone so 
inexperienced. Maybe this had been something Aeka had been planning 
for a long time. 

&quot;Yes she asked me to stop. She often does.&quot; 

Washu looked up at the robot. &quot;When did she say &#39;Ramen&#39;?&quot; 

&quot;She began repeating that phrase twenty minutes into our time 
together.&quot; 

Washu&#39;s eyes flashed with a cold certainty. &quot;So after she said that 
you still kept beating her for a half hour?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

Of course, the robot had never been told the safe word and Washu had 
always been there to keep it in check. Also Washu had been keeping 
Mecha Washu from using its full strength. But there was no way Aeka 
could have known that. Never the less, Washu was pissed and there was 
only one thing on her mind. &quot;Mecha Washu, self destruct sequences 
0569.&quot; There was a brief flash and the robot dissolved totally into 
its basic molecules. 

Turning back to Aeka, Washu felt her chest ache. &quot;Gods I&#39;m sorry Aeka. 
I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;ll make it better. You&#39;ll be fine.&quot; 

On the floor Aeka weakly turned her head to look at Washu. Her bottom 
lip trembling she let out a gut-wrenching scream before collapsing 
back to the floor. For Washu, the fear in her eyes had been the worst 
part. 

Aeka was fine less than ten minutes later and another ten minutes she 
had woken up. When she saw Washu instead of screaming or talking she&#39;d 
simply blinked, stood up, and turned to walkout the door that 
appeared. Washu reached out, but quickly pulled her hand back. Sitting 
alone in the dark lab, she wrapped her arms around her own shoulders 
and simply sat there. 

Yagami docked with GPHQ two days after they left Earth. They weren&#39;t 
met, but Kiyone made sure to sign the entry log anyway. 

They walked silently through the passages. The day before Mihoshi had 
been so worried that Kiyone had to reassure her several times that 
things were going to be fine. That had led to them holding each other 
and then other things. Both of them were walking a bit funny. 

At the service desk Kiyone spoke to the secretary. &quot;Officers Kiyone 
and Mihoshi here on request from GPHQ.&quot; 

Checking the computer the man nodded and said, &quot;You are to proceed 
immediately to room 290 where a superior officer and the person who 
lodged the complaint are waiting for you.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Mihoshi said, trying to be polite. 

Several minutes later they arrived at the door. &quot;Let me do the talking 
Mihoshi.&quot; 

&quot;Sure Kiyone.&quot; Mihoshi said back. Kiyone hit the pressure pad and the 
door opened. 

&quot;Ah, officers. Please, come in.&quot; Said the voice of the man Kiyone 
recognized as Captain Hiriko. They stepped through the door and it 
closed behind them. &quot;Would you care for a seat.&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Mihoshi said, then Kiyone elbowed her in the ribs. 

&quot;We&#39;ll stand.&quot; Kiyone said. 

The captain nodded. &quot;Very well. Are you aware of the charges?&quot; 

&quot;Yes sir. I&#39;ve looked things over very carefully and I have to say all 
of my reports have been turned in on time and I have filled out all of 
the forms.&quot; Kiyone heard a snort behind her somewhere off to the left. 
Obviously their mysterious complainer. She didn&#39;t turn to look. &quot;I&#39;m 
unaware why we would have had any complaints logged against us.&quot; 

&quot;Us.&quot; Said the chief. &quot;Well I&#39;m afraid that is the problem officer. 
You seem to be under the mistaken impression that you have something 
to do with why we have called you here. You are not the problem.&quot; He 
nodded pointedly to the person Kiyone hadn&#39;t looked at. They stepped 
forward and began to speak. She wasn&#39;t the least bit surprised to see 
who it was. 

&quot;While going through some reports I came across something I felt 
needed to be shown to the superior officers.&quot; Mitsuki said, not even 
bothering to hide her grin. &quot;It seems that both sets of union files 
were filled out by the same person, not by two halves of an official 
couple.&quot; 

&quot;But Kiyone always does the paperwork.&quot; Mihoshi said suddenly. Kiyone 
flinched as the chief nodded. 

&quot;That appears to be exactly the point. It seems to be that Kiyone does 
all of the work for your area. What exactly is it that you do 
Mihoshi?&quot; Mihoshi stood there quietly. &quot;Well officer?&quot; 

&quot;I... I help out when someone attacks.&quot; Mihoshi said. 

&quot;The last attack we have on record was over a year ago when, after 
confirming your report with the Science Academy, it was proved that 
the two of you were the only officers available to travel to the time 
period required to save the life of Jurai&#39;s heirs from the criminal 
Kain. Before that was the Kagato incident. Aside from those two 
incidents neither of you seem to do more than check the occasional 
traffic violation through the Sol system... and all of those reports 
were written by officer Kiyone.&quot; 

&quot;Um... yes?&quot; Mihoshi said. 

&quot;Sir, I really don&#39;t...&quot; Kiyone began. 

Mitsuki said, &quot;Oh I think you do Kiyone. You&#39;ve been covering for a 
partner who has been abusing you to avoid work.&quot; 

&quot;Abusing me?&quot; Kiyone yelled. &quot;I&#39;m the one who insisted...&quot; 

&quot;I would never use Kiyone like that!&quot; Mihoshi said at the same time. 

&quot;Never the less,&quot; The captain said. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that I may be 
detecting a breach in ethics.&quot; 

&quot;And that means retraining and reassigning.&quot; Mitsuki said with a 
malicious grin. Both of the other officers could practically taste the 
hatred shooting off her. It was clear to Kiyone that Mitsuki had 
poured over the paperwork, probably for weeks, looking for anything 
that could be used against them. Unfortunately Kiyone could see no way 
out of it. 

&quot;Kiyone.&quot; Mihoshi said, her voice uncharacteristically quiet. &quot;Please, 
could you wait in the hall for a minute?&quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; Kiyone asked. She looked at Mihoshi and said, &quot;I think we 
should talk to the captain and...&quot; 

&quot;Regulations are quite clear.&quot; The captain said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but abuse 
of a relationship such as this...&quot; Mihoshi didn&#39;t let him finish. 

In a voice that was practically made of ice she snapped, &quot;Kiyone wait 
in the hall!&quot; 

Kiyone was shocked. She&#39;d never heard Mihoshi&#39;s voice sound like 
that... not even when she was focused. Kiyone had thought that 
occasionally she had seen the real Mihoshi, the one hidden behind the 
mask of dull naivety that she&#39;d been trained to adopt when she&#39;d been 
in special operations. But now Kiyone saw another Mihoshi... and this 
one scared her. Without another word she turned and headed towards the 
door. 

&quot;You can&#39;t do that!&quot; Mitsuki said. 

&quot;I have not dismissed either of you.&quot; The captain added. 

Kiyone paused with her finger hovering above the control pad. But the 
voice Mihoshi had used left no room for doubt. Ignoring the protests 
she hit the button and stepped out of the room. 

&quot;This will mean your job!&quot; The captain yelled as the door closed. 

Kiyone sighed and leaned back against the wall. What the hell had she 
just done? Her career was over. Even if she went back to Earth there 
was no way she could ever be a police officer again. Even the police 
there required strenuous background checks and without GP issued 
equipment and computer hacking they would have trouble even finding 
the crummy part time jobs they were used to. Was she going to have to 
sponge off Tenchi and Aeka for the rest of her life. 

Well probably not. She and Mihoshi hadn&#39;t had occasion to use any of 
their GP paycheck for almost two years now. Adding it up in her head 
she realized that if necessary they could live quite well on another 
planet, or even purchase the equipment they&#39;d need to live on Earth. 

The door opened and Mihoshi stepped out with her usual smile in place. 
&quot;Ready to go?&quot; 

&quot;Sure. Did they say who to turn our badges in to?&quot; 

Mihoshi blinked in surprise. &quot;You want to quit? I wish you&#39;d told me 
that before?&quot; 

&quot;Quit? He just fired us!&quot; 

&quot;Oh that.&quot; Mihoshi waved her hand. &quot;I talked to him. We just got 
raises and Mitsuki has been demoted to janitor.&quot; Kiyone looked over 
Mihoshi&#39;s shoulder. The captain was still behind his desk, but he was 
staring off into space. Mitsuki was in a corner, curled up in a ball 
and also not seeing anything despite the unblinking expression on her 
face. 

&quot;How?&quot; Kiyone whispered. &quot;How did you do that?&quot; 

Mihoshi smiled and hugged her. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about...&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Kiyone said firmly. &quot;Mihoshi I love you... but I need to know. 
Who are you?&quot; 

&quot;Kiyone I...&quot; She saw the look on Kiyone&#39;s face and her smile faded. 
&quot;Well okay, if you insist. But you have to keep it quiet.&quot; She stepped 
out of the door, allowing it to close. &quot;And... if you feel differently 
about me I&#39;ll understand.&quot; 

&quot;Mihoshi.&quot; Kiyone said exasperatedly. &quot;We&#39;ve been over that a hundred 
times. I thought I was supposed to be the insecure one. I&#39;m not going 
to stop loving you.&quot; 

&quot;Fine... but we can&#39;t ever discuss this again.&quot; Her eyes were harder 
than Kiyone had ever seen. The blue was darker and there was a set to 
her jaw. &quot;Mimuri Harushi.&quot; 

Kiyone&#39;s jaw dropped. Ten years before Mimuri Harushi had been the 
youngest person to pass the entrance exams to the Galaxy Police. 
Kiyone had done a paper on her, searching through files that had only 
been released months before she herself had entered training. Harushi 
had been drafted into special operations at age 15 from the usual 
ranks and had spent seven years handling hundreds of the worst cases 
available. She&#39;d been in charge of black ops that were still 
classified, but that rumors said involved torture. She&#39;d disappeared 
from active duty after an incident that required her identity to be 
changed, some reports saying she&#39;d uncovered a conspiracy within the 
GP that require no one but her to know who she&#39;d become. 

Mihoshi&#39;s blank look returned and she said, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s head for 
home.&quot; 

Kiyone swallowed and glanced at the door. The two people in there had 
obviously been scared to death. And the vacuous blond that always let 
Kiyone do the talking had done it. &quot;Mihoshi... we need to talk more 
about this.&quot; 

&quot;On the way back Kiyone.&quot; Mihoshi said cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you 
everything, I promise... and if you want you can call me Mimuri. I 
haven&#39;t had anyone call me that in a long time.&quot; 

For three days Aeka had contented herself to walking around the empty 
house. She&#39;d made herself some meals, none of them very good, and had 
avoided the door to Washu&#39;s lab. She wanted to go in, she knew, but 
she couldn&#39;t bring herself to do it. 

Finally though, Washu saved her the trouble. While Washu was sitting 
on the couch, staring at a blank screen, Aeka saw the door open 
slowly. Then she saw Washu step out and close it softly behind her. 

&quot;Aeka...&quot; Washu said. The princess turned, more out of shock to 
Washu&#39;s nervous tone. &quot;Aeka I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to 
apologize enough. I know you don&#39;t want to see my right now but I just 
needed to say that I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Washu,&quot; Aeka breathed and stood up. &quot;Washu I don&#39;t blame you.&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t?&quot; Washu stared at her, feeling her heart beating in her 
chest. &quot;But I&#39;m the one who... I...&quot; 

&quot;Washu I&#39;m the one who tried to use Mecha Washu without you. I didn&#39;t 
think. It was my fault.&quot; 

&quot;You mean you don&#39;t hate me?&quot; 

Aeka stepped forward, banging her leg into the arm of the couch. As 
she fell she saw Washu dive forward to catch her. From the arms of the 
small scientist she looked up and smiled. &quot;Washu, I could never hate 
you.&quot; 

&quot;Aeka.&quot; Washu had tears brimming in her eyes. &quot;When you were hurt you 
looked at me with so much fear... and then you didn&#39;t talk to me...&quot; 

Aeka wrapped her arms around Washu and buried her face in the woman&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;I was afraid you&#39;d be mad at me. I was so afraid you 
wouldn&#39;t want...&quot; 

They both stood there hugging each other for a long time. Finally 
Washu said, &quot;Aeka I... I really do love you. You know that right?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, I do Washu.&quot; Aeka said. Pulling back she smiled into Washu&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m glad you finally said it though.&quot; 

&quot;If it would make you feel better Aeka, we could switch. You could be 
in charge. Or maybe we could try to be gentle and just... I don&#39;t 
know. Just try normal sex.&quot; 

Aeka dug her nails into Washu&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Washu I don&#39;t blame you 
for what happened. It&#39;s up to you what we do. You know that. That&#39;s 
how I like it...&quot; She paused for a moment. &quot;But if those are things 
you want to do that&#39;s okay too.&quot; She kissed Washu&#39;s cheek softly. &quot;But 
I do so love it when you hurt me.&quot; Washu managed a weak laugh at that. 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong now?&quot; 

&quot;I... I destroyed Mecha Washu for what she did to you.&quot; Washu said. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t even think twice about it.&quot; 

Aeka thought about it, but finally nodded. &quot;That&#39;s probably for the 
best. Mihoshi and Kiyone would have been upset if they knew.&quot; 

&quot;Oh... yeah. I was going to tell you about that. Mihoshi walked in on 
us a little while ago.&quot; Aeka shrugged. &quot;You don&#39;t care?&quot; 

&quot;I thought they might have known.&quot; Aeka said. 

Washu was amazed. &quot;You&#39;ve changed a lot Aeka.&quot; She ran a finger 
through the long purple hair of the girl in her arms. 

&quot;I&#39;ve grown up Washu. And you&#39;re the one who helped me do it. You gave 
me what I needed and taught me how to express it. Just because of one 
mistake I would never want to give you up.&quot; She smiled and kissed 
Washu on the corner of the mouth. &quot;Even if it meant giving up 
everything else I have.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s something else.&quot; Washu said. Stepping forward she swung her 
leg onto the couch and pulled Aeka into her lap. &quot;If the royal family 
found out about this they might demand that you give me up or the 
throne. What with the heir issue...&quot; 

Aeka smiled and shook her head. &quot;Who wants to be a princess anyway? 
But as for the heir issue I wouldn&#39;t think that would be a problem for 
you... when it comes up.&quot; Washu smiled and shrugged. &quot;But that&#39;s 
later. I&#39;m not needed on Jurai right now. The empress... the empress 
is only needed for emergencies. I trust that Jurai can run itself 
without me interfering more than necessary and in the mean time I will 
be here. And if I ever need to go back...&quot; 

&quot;I think I could alter a door in your room.&quot; Washu finished. Looking 
into Aeka&#39;s eyes she said, &quot;I was so afraid you wouldn&#39;t want to be 
with me again. Sometimes I&#39;ve been very cruel to you.&quot; 

&quot;I wanted you to.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;I&#39;ve never had to use the safe word 
with you Washu, even though you insisted I make one up.&quot; 

&quot;I know but...&quot; 

Aeka pushed away and lay along the couch cushions. &quot;If it will make 
you feel better you can have me right here. You can be gentle, 
romantic, and caring. We can see how that is.&quot; 

&quot;Right here? In the living room?&quot; 

&quot;Why not?&quot; Aeka ran a hand alone the front of her own shirt, grabbing 
her left breast tightly. &quot;We&#39;re all alone. The others aren&#39;t coming 
back.&quot; 

As an answer Washu ran her hand up Aeka&#39;s leg and under her dress. Her 
fingers quickly began exploring between Aeka&#39;s legs, causing the 
princess to gasp. Since they had started their new relationship, Aeka 
and Washu had touched, licked, and fucked every possible bit of each 
other&#39;s bodies. There was not a spot on or in Aeka&#39;s body that hadn&#39;t 
been repeatedly and forcefully violated by Washu and there wasn&#39;t a 
bit of Washu that Aeka hadn&#39;t allowed herself to be forced to do just 
as much to. 

&quot;Little Washu,&quot; Aeka breathed. 

Washu smiled, lightly dipping her fingers into Aeka&#39;s ass and pussy, 
switching from one to the other at random. Soon her fingers were quiet 
wet and both of Aeka&#39;s holes were lubricated. &quot;Mmm, my little slut if 
definitely in a good mood today. Why do you think that is?&quot; 

&quot;Cause I love you Little Washu. I love you and what you do to me.&quot; 
Aeka now hand both hands squeezing herself through her shirt as Washu 
massaged her neither regions. &quot;I love how you touch me and how you 
punish me and make me do things I would never be able to do.&quot; 

&quot;Like when I taught you to lick my ass.&quot; Washu said, her voice getting 
deeper. Aeka&#39;s back arches and her hips bucked when Washu slide a 
finger deeper into her. &quot;You almost didn&#39;t do it. You almost said the 
word.&quot; 

&quot;I remember.&quot; Aeka hissed. &quot;You waited just long enough to make sure I 
wasn&#39;t going to do it, but I still struggled. You grabbed me by the 
hair and shoved my face into it and then you said, &#39;You&#39;ll do as 
you&#39;re told bitch!&#39; and raked your nails across my back.&quot; 

Washu kissed Aeka&#39;s knee and rubbed her face into the princess&#39;s 
thigh. &quot;And that was all it took. You pushed that tongue of yours in 
hard and just kept licking.&quot; 

&quot;How about when I first let you do it to me? I thought I&#39;d die of 
embarrassment and I never thought you&#39;d be able to fit that toy of 
yours into me.&quot; 

&quot;I made it fit.&quot; Washu purred. She pulled up Aeka&#39;s dress so she could 
see her own hands working around Aeka&#39;s pussy. There were no panties. 
&quot;I pushed that rubber dick so far into you I wasn&#39;t sure it would ever 
come out.&quot; She slipped out from under Aeka&#39;s legs and stood up, 
letting her fingers slide out. Looking down at Aeka she absently 
licked them clean and watched while the princess tweaked the nipples 
sticking through her shirt. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t want it to. I was staring at you in those straps holding it 
to your waist and inside you. I may have screamed for you to take it 
out, but I wasn&#39;t going to let it go without a fight.&quot; With lightning 
fast speed she reached out and grabbed Washu, forcing her down onto 
the couch and wrapped her legs around the scientist&#39;s thighs pushing 
her heels into Washu&#39;s butt and kissing her furiously. Her hips began 
to buck and shortly Washu joined in, banging her pelvis into Aeka&#39;s 
until it hurt. 

Then Aeka rolled over sending them both to the floor, with Aeka on 
top. She released Washu&#39;s mouth and sat up on top of her, still 
bucking her hips. Reaching back she pushed her way under Washu&#39;s skirt 
and began to repeat what had been done to her. Beneath her Washu 
squirmed and moaned. 

Using her free hand Aeka tore open the top of Washu&#39;s shirt and stared 
down into her eyes. &quot;Washu, since you asked I&#39;ll take control this 
time. But I don&#39;t want to keep it. I want to trade back and forth from 
now on. Is that understood?&quot; 

Washu nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot; 

Aeka grinned and dug a nail into the wall of Washu&#39;s pussy, causing 
her to scream in pain and cum at the same time. &quot;You will call me 
princess.&quot; Then coming onto Washu&#39;s belly, she lowered her head and 
dug her teeth into Washu&#39;s breast to leave her mark. Fresh blood 
filled her mouth and Washu came again. 


Author&#39;s note 

I asked people who&#39;ve read earlier chapters if I should write this 
one. I got numerous cries of &quot;Hell yes!&quot; and a few suggestions, chief 
of these to do another Aeka-Washu chapter where Aeka got to be on top.
