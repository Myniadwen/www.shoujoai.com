Sae smiled as the black haired woman pushed her glasses up and finished 
explaining, &quot;Would that be all right?&quot;

May blinked, the brown haired cyberdoll looking at the young woman 
curiously. &quot;To be concise, you want to sketch people in the bar?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Hiro agreed, the brown haired woman&#39;s hair tied up on 
each side of her face. Despite her youth she had a almost motherly 
quality that was very endearing.

&quot;I don&#39;t see a problem,&quot; May said after a moment&#39;s thought as the woman 
in a maid&#39;s uniform continued, &quot;but ask permission, and if anyone 
objects stop.&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much!&quot; both women bowed before walking off, sketch books 
in hand as they considered where to begin.

&quot;They&#39;re really cute, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Keiko had to chuckle, the brown 
haired woman&#39;s arm still in a sling. She wore a dark T-shirt and black 
pants rather than a suit, and her hair was in a ponytail rather than 
braided.

&quot;That they are,&quot; May agreed before frowning gently at her lover, &quot;Are 
you trying to help serve again? You know you need to go easy on that 
arm.&quot;

Keiko laughed, &quot;May, I have Alpha, Excel, Ryouko and Sasami all offering 
to get me things. If I wanted to, I&#39;d never have to move again.&quot;

&quot;Getting a little tired of it?&quot; May guessed.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Keiko laughed.

At the entrance a red headed woman in a slinky dress smiled a little 
shyly at Alpha, &quot;Hello, you&#39;re new here.&quot;

&quot;My name is Alpha,&quot; the green haired android bowed a bit, &quot;I&#39;ve been 
here for a few months, now.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; the other woman&#39;s smile faltered a bit as she added, &quot;it has been 
a while. My name is Ayaka Kisaragi.&quot;

Alpha&#39;s eyes widened a little, &quot;You&#39;re Nabiki&#39;s ex.&quot;

Ayaka sighed, &quot;You could say that, yes. Do you know if she&#39;s in?&quot;

She hesitated then Alpha said diplomatically, &quot;Why don&#39;t we show you to 
a seat and someone can go check?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Ayaka nodded as she let Alpha lead her to a table.

Ayaka sat down at the table, toying with the glass of water Alpha left 
her as the girl hurried up to the bar to have a whispered consultation 
with Ryouko. She looked around at the older members of the staff and 
nearly cringed, seeing most of them glaring right at her.

&#39;Which I can&#39;t really blame them for,&#39; Ayaka silently conceded as she 
drank, &#39;I did dump their friend after all.&#39;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Midori Sugiura asked as she stopped up at the bar to pick up a 
order, &quot;is the redhead a axe murderer or something?&quot;

&quot;She broke a friend of our&#39;s heart,&quot; Ryouko explained crossly as the 
blue haired alien woman poured drinks smoothly.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Midori murmured as she saw Keiko going upstairs to see if the 
bar&#39;s accountant was in the manager&#39;s office.

Keiko paused by the door then knocked firmly, &quot;Anyone in there?&quot;

&quot;Yo,&quot; Nabiki answered and Keiko used one arm and her shoulder to get the 
door open, looking in to see Nabiki Tendo hard at work, the black haired 
woman going over the nightclub&#39;s finances with her usual care.

&quot;Sorry to interrupt,&quot; Keiko said wryly.

&quot;Keiko,&quot; Nabiki looked up with a smile and asked, &quot;come up to get away 
from all the mothering down there?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Keiko sighed and decided it might be best to be blunt. 
&quot;Ayaka&#39;s down there asking for you,&quot; she said.

&quot;She&#39;s WHAT?&quot; Nabiki blurted, looking at Keiko in surprise.

Keiko decided that was a rhetorical question and ignored it before 
asking gently, &quot;Do you want me to tell her you&#39;re not here?&quot;

Nabiki sighed, running a hand through her hair. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she 
admitted softly before asking, &quot;was anyone with her?&quot;

&quot;From what I could see,&quot; Keiko shrugged uncomfortably, &quot;she was alone.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s something,&quot; Nabiki muttered quietly, looking down at the 
paperwork on her desk as if it held the answers.

&quot;Do you want us to tell her you left?&quot; Keiko offered gently, a little 
surprised to see how torn Nabiki looked.

Nabiki sighed, &quot;No, I&#39;d better go see her.&quot;

Meanwhile, a group of young women were settling around the tables off to 
one side, all of them chatting happily. The blonde woman with glasses 
said firmly, &quot;Iono, you can&#39;t try to grab anyone here as sobame.&quot;

&quot;But Kyas!&quot; Iono protested, the elegant black haired woman pouting 
cutely.

&quot;No buts,&quot; Kyas said, &quot;we&#39;re already over the number you promised 
earlier.&quot;

The taller woman in sunglasses looked around warily as she reported, 
&quot;There&#39;s a number of unusual individuals here, but no immediate 
threats.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Fletch,&quot; Aida chuckled, her boyish cut hair falling around 
her face as she urged Kyas to sit, too. She looked amused, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t 
you be seeing to your girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Aida!&quot; Fletch blushed.

Arata Tagoto blushed too, the younger soba chef still staying close to 
Fletch&#39;s side. Since joining Iono&#39;s sobane she had made her interest in 
Fletch clear, and to all outside observers it was clear that she was 
wearing the other woman down.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry mom,&quot; Arujent told Fletch seriously, &quot;I&#39;ll keep an eye on 
the perverted queen while you two dance.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Iono protested the insult.

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; Arata smiled at Aru, glad the young girl had 
become her unofficial ally.

Iono chuckled softly as they watched the two of them walk off to where 
other couples were dancing slowly. &quot;They do make a cute couple, don&#39;t 
they?&quot; she said, smiling at the black haired woman with glasses beside 
her.

&quot;They&#39;re adorable,&quot; Eto Hachibe had to concede, even tho her gaze was 
most focused on Iono herself.

Iono smiled, &quot;Not as adorable as you, Eto.&quot;

&quot;Iono!&quot; Eto blushed cutely, looking away.

Nabiki had to smile slightly as she passed the table and wished she 
could linger a bit. But no, she stiffened her back and headed to the 
table where Ayaka waited. &#39;God, she&#39;s as beautiful as ever,&#39; Nabiki 
thought, feeling once again the twisting pain she&#39;d experienced when 
Ayaka gave her the ring back.

Ayaka looked up, her expression oddly gently as she said &quot;Nabiki, it&#39;s 
good to see you.&quot;

Nabiki pressed her lips together as she rested her hands on the chair, 
looking down at her scornfully. &quot;What do you want, Ayaka?&quot; she asked 
flatly.

Ayaka sighed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Nabiki. I was a fool.&quot;

Nabiki gave her a look as she asked, &quot;You drop out of my life for months 
then show up to tell me that?&quot;

&quot;Could you please sit down?&quot; Ayaka asked with a blush, &quot;You&#39;re making a 
scene.&quot;

Nabiki nodded curtly as she pulled out the chair, sitting down as the 
air between them practically shimmered with tension. Completely ignoring 
the tension Midori breezed in, &quot;Can I get you anything, Nabiki? Refill, 
Ayaka?&quot;

&quot;Something strong,&quot; Nabiki sighed as Ayaka also ordered.

&quot;Be right back,&quot; Midori nodded as she headed off.

Ayaka looked at Nabiki sadly, &quot;I don&#39;t remember you being this hard.&quot;

Nabiki gave her a pained look, &quot;Ayaka, I thought we had something good. 
Then you gave me my ring and told me you needed time... and the onje 
time I tried to see you I found out from you secretary you were out with 
a guy.&quot;

&quot;I... needed to get that out of my system,&quot; Ayaka responded weakly.

Nabiki sighed, &quot;Ayaka, I just don&#39;t trust you anymore.&quot;

Midori arrived with their drinks, setting a cocktail in front of Ayaka 
and a dangerously bubbling mug in front of Nabiki. &quot;Here you go,&quot; she 
said cheerfully.

&quot;What is that?&quot; Nabiki asked, looking at her mug warily.

&quot;According to Ryouko,&quot; Midori looked thoughtful, &quot;it&#39;s a Pan-Galactic 
Gargle Blaster.&quot; She shrugged, &quot;I guess it&#39;s strong.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nabiki answered, nearly fainting from the fumes.

Ayaka fiddled with her drink, &quot;You know, I had this whole scenario 
planned out in my head... you&#39;d forgive me, I&#39;d buy you the best dinner 
Sasami can make then we&#39;d go upstairs... I guess I was dreaming.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Nabiki trailed off, not knowing what to say.

Ayaka tossed down her drink and got up, &quot;It&#39;s all right, Nabiki.&quot; She 
gave her a sad smile, &quot;I hope we can be friends... someday.&quot;
