<h1>Conquest (part 24 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a>

<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>        Queen Tenchi&#39;s startling suggestion that the Earth join the 
Republic of Manticore cut across all of the conversations, the 
meeting dropping to near silence. All their eyes turned to Ryouko 
and Ayeka, the two rulers who would have to make the next decision.

        &quot;I think I like it,&quot; Ryouko finally said to herself 
thoughtfully, pushing her long mane of light blue hair backwards.

        Ayeka nodded her agreement, &quot;As do I.&quot; She looked over at 
Queen Serenity and asked, &quot;Do you have any objections?&quot;

        Lady Mars opened up her mouth to say something, then closed 
it when her Queen forcefully elbowed her in the side. &quot;As long as 
you protect the sovereignty of the Moon Kingdom, I have no problems 
with it,&quot; the Queen said diplomatically.

        &quot;That&#39;s all I was going to say,&quot; Lady Mars muttered softly.

        &quot;Maybe so,&quot; Serenity murmured back with a slight smile, &quot;but 
I suspect you would have put it in somewhat blunter terms.&quot;

        Mars smiled wryly, &quot;True.&quot;

        &quot;The Moon Kingdom has been our friend and ally for many 
years,&quot; Ryouko said calmly, &quot;and we have no interest in changing 
that in a territorial grab.&quot;

        Tenchi smiled slightly, her long dark hair flowing past her 
shoulders. &quot;I take it that we&#39;re all in agreement?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; Serenity nodded.

        &quot;Let&#39;s get the oath swearing done, then,&quot; Ryouko said, 
walking over to where Tenchi stood. She looked around, &quot;Who wants to 
be the witnesses?&quot;

        &quot;I will,&quot; Funaho spoke up gravely, with Washu also chiming 
in with her agreement.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Tenchi smiled.

        &quot;Place your hand over your heart,&quot; Ryouko instructed her 
quietly. &quot;Do you swear, by the honor of your family and of your 
bloodline, not to raise rebellion against the Republic and people of 
Manticore?&quot; she asked formally.

        &quot;I so swear,&quot; Tenchi said as she met Ryouko&#39;s catlike eyes 
directly, her purple tinted eyes clear of guile and deception.

        Serenity smiled wryly, &quot;Time to start negotiating again.&quot; 
Several questioning glances were thrown her way and she 
explained, &quot;The Moon kingdom is now a little sovereign bubble in the 
middle of Manticore space. We need to define that bubble, sorry to 
say.&quot;

        &quot;Washu?&quot; Ayeka looked over at Ryouko&#39;s mother.

        &quot;Yeah, I can handle it,&quot; Washu agreed. She looked over at 
Ryouko, &quot;You mind?&quot;

        &quot;I was about to ask you myself,&quot; Ryouko agreed. She looked 
over at Serenity, &quot;You might as well bring down Lady Mercury, too. 
That way they can define the exact size of the Moon Kingdom&#39;s 
territory to the last micron.&quot;

        &quot;Now I get to break the news to the planet&#39;s population,&quot; 
Tenchi said softly, the look on her face showing that she wasn&#39;t 
looking forward to it.

        &quot;It&#39;ll be all right,&quot; Funaho said comfortingly to her 
granddaughter. They looked remarkably alike, these two dark purple 
haired women with the dark eyes. She smiled gently, &quot;In fact, I 
think I have an idea on how to soften the blow...&quot;

        The announcement that came a few hours later was politically 
masterful, the commentators would all agree. Tenchi presented the 
joining with Manticore as the uniting of two long separated 
families, of becoming part of something that by rights they should 
have been a member all along. Of the imperial ambitions of Noboyuki 
she spoke none at all, and it seemed likely that he would become 
merely a footnote in history.

        Standing beside Tenchi as she made her broadcast was Funaho 
and Masaki, her two grandmothers. They seemed to bring both a sense 
of gravity and gentleness to the proceedings, and it was clear that 
they cared for the young ruler that they had just met.

        &quot;So what happens now?&quot; Serenity inquired as they stood 
together on the launching pad nearby Tenchi&#39;s palace. A Moon Kingdom 
vessel awaited their queen, while Ayeka and Ryouko planned to take 
Ryo-ohki.

        &quot;Minagi has agreed to stick around with Swordbreaker and 
half of the fighters,&quot; Ayeka said, &quot;just in case any Earth ships 
haven&#39;t received the surrender order.&quot;

        &quot;And in case Tenchi decides to pull a fast one,&quot; Ryouko 
noted. The others gave her curious glances, &quot;I like the lady, but I 
don&#39;t know if I trust her just yet.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Ayeka admitted.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad that Washu and Yume are also staying behind, 
helping the Moon Kingdom restore our ships and defenses,&quot; Serenity 
noted. She smiled slightly, &quot;The young lady who helped save the 
Palace, Mitsuki, what&#39;s happening to her?&quot;

        &quot;Minagi has offered her a position on Swordbreaker along 
with her being our Galaxy Police liaison,&quot; Ryouko said, &quot;I think 
she&#39;s going to accept.&quot; She chuckled softly, &quot;And where Mitsuki 
goes, Rhione is soon to follow.&quot;

        &quot;They seem much in love,&quot; Ayeka agreed. She smiled 
slightly, &quot;My mothers are also staying for a while, to get to know 
their new granddaughter a bit better.&quot;

        Serenity raised an eyebrow, &quot;Aren&#39;t you worried?&quot;

        &quot;She gave her word,&quot; Ryouko noted. She grinned 
suddenly, &quot;And my mothers-in-law can take care of themselves, 
believe me.&quot;

        &quot;They&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Ayeka agreed, having made her farewells 
to her mothers earlier.

        &quot;Myah,&quot; Ryo-ohki agreed, munching on a carrot at their feet.

        The Moon Kingdom ship sent some signal, and Serenity made a 
face. &quot;Time to go,&quot; she shook both Ayeka and Ryouko&#39;s hands. &quot;Thank 
you, for helping my Kingdom and neutralizing the threat that Earth 
presented us,&quot; she said gently.

        &quot;It was our pleasure,&quot; Ryouko smiled wryly.

        &quot;We were glad to help,&quot; Ayeka murmured.

        The tall blonde walked away from them, pausing a moment 
before she entered the ship. &quot;You offered once for the Kingdom to 
join Manticore,&quot; Serenity smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll think about it.&quot;

        &quot;Huh,&quot; Ryouko murmured as Serenity&#39;s ship rose up, quickly 
disappearing into the distance, &quot;Well, what do you know...&quot;

        Ayeka gently put her hand on Ryouko&#39;s arm, &quot;We probably 
should get moving, too.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Ryouko bent down, picking up Ryo-ohki gently by the 
scruff of the neck. &quot;Go, Ryo-ohki!&quot; she cried, flinging the cabbit 
up into the air. The little furball expanded, shifting from flesh to 
organic crystal until a starship in black and red floated above them.

        &quot;Myah!&quot; Ryo-ohki projected a transport beam, pulling Ayeka 
and Ryouko inside of her. They zipped to the palace to pick up 
Sasami, and then the vessel broke from Earth&#39;s atmosphere to reach 
the moon. Kiyone and Minagi boarded there, along with a few others, 
and they waited a few moments before the fighters arrived.

        &quot;Connect us to Swordbreaker,&quot; Ryouko ordered, and a few 
seconds later Minagi&#39;s face appeared on the screen.

        &quot;Hey, sis,&quot; Minagi gave a little wave. Behind her Mitsuki 
stood, and not far from her Rhione waited serenely. &quot;We&#39;ll keep an 
eye on things here for a bit.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Ryouko nodded. &quot;I don&#39;t expect there to be any 
trouble, but I&#39;d rather be safe,&quot; she explained. A little 
grin, &quot;I&#39;ll send Nagi over here once we get home, too.&quot;

        Minagi grinned sheepishly, &quot;I&#39;d appreciate it.&quot; She 
paused, &quot;Hey, Kiyone?&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; the dark haired officer answered, a slight smile on 
Kiyone&#39;s face.

        &quot;Keep Ryouko out of trouble while I&#39;m gone,&quot; Minagi smirked.

        &quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Kiyone answered dryly.

        Ayeka snickered softly at that. &quot;Please watch over my 
mothers,&quot; she said softly, &quot;as much as they&#39;ll allow you to, anyway.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll do our best,&quot; Mitsuki spoke up. Her red hair was 
growing in rather scruffy, but oddly it seemed to suit her. &quot;Have a 
nice trip, all.&quot;

        &quot;See you in a few weeks,&quot; Ryouko agreed as the fighters 
moved into position around them. Ryo-ohki extended her transit field 
and shields around the few fighters, there was a momentary falling 
sensation in the passengers and they were off.

        Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Sasami soon left the bridge, but Ayeka 
and Ryouko stood there together in the grand chamber. Ayeka relaxed 
against Ryouko&#39;s shoulder, the slightly smaller woman softly sighing 
her contentment.

        &quot;It&#39;s been an interesting few months,&quot; Ayeka finally 
murmured softly, &quot;is it always this exciting in the Republic of 
Manticore?&quot;

        &quot;This is nothing,&quot; Ryouko&#39;s voice was clearly amused as she 
continued, &quot;you should see when it&#39;s actually exciting.&quot;

        &quot;I walked right into that one,&quot; Ayeka punched Ryouko in the 
shoulder, but she was smiling. They looked out into the void 
together, the other- space of hyperspace all around them. &quot;So what 
happens now?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Well,&quot; Ryouko smiled, &quot;I intend to take you bellow later 
and...&quot;

        &quot;Not that,&quot; Ayeka blushed, even though she didn&#39;t sound 
displeased with the idea. &quot;I meant to the Republic, now that you&#39;ve 
taken both Jurai and Earth?&quot;

        &quot;We rebuild,&quot; Ryouko&#39;s voice was gentle, &quot;both Jurai and 
Earth need assistance. We&#39;ll bring both regions of space into the 
fold, helping establish the quality of life and codes of law that 
Manticore is well known for.&quot;

        &quot;And the conquest?&quot; Ayeka asked softly.

        &quot;I&#39;m a warrior, Ayeka,&quot; Ryouko answered quietly, &quot;if 
something nasty shows up on our boarders, spoiling for a fight, 
we&#39;ll be ready.&quot; She smiled, &quot;But if you&#39;re asking if I intend to go 
on any more military adventures, then no.&quot;

        &quot;Really?&quot; Ayeka looked up at her in surprise.

        Ryouko took advantage of that upwards motion, kissing her 
and slipping her a bit of tongue. They reluctantly separated and she 
smiled, &quot;I don&#39;t need to go looking for a battle when I&#39;ve won what 
I most wanted.&quot;

        &quot;I love you,&quot; Ayeka sighed, snuggling into Ryouko&#39;s arms.

        Ryouko tightened her grip around the other woman, &quot;And I 
love you.&quot;

        This isn&#39;t the end for their story, for in truth such a tale 
cannot be said to have an end. Ayeka and Ryouko lead the Republic of 
Manticore to greatness, becoming much loved by the peoples of all 
the worlds that they ruled. When Mitsuki and Rhione returned to 
Manticore it was as a wedded couple, a ceremony performed by the 
ship&#39;s captain Minagi. The captain herself refused to marry, Minagi 
and Nagi cheerfully living in sin.

        The Republic of Manticore would continue to expand, but 
through more diplomatic means rather than using force of arms. Queen 
Serenity of the Moon Kingdom chose to join with Manticore, 
eventually, and many other planets would decide to follow her 
example. The benefits of joining the Republic were obvious, 
including both economic and military factors.

        In time, Queen Tenchi of Earth would come to the Courts of 
the Republic, to learn of the rulers of other worlds and to formally 
present herself to the planet of her ancestors. Tenchi would learn 
much there, and have many adventures...

        But that is a tale for another time...</pre>
