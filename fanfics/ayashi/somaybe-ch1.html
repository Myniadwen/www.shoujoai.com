<h1>So Maybe I Am</h1>

<pre>      Shuro drew her lips away from Aya&#39;s cheek. &quot;You seemed to need a 
kiss&quot; she said &quot;So snap out of it girl; I&#39;m sure your Touya&#39;s okay, by 
the way...&quot; Before Shuro could finish her sentence Aya was already 
calling out &quot;Thanks Shuro! I&#39;m coming, Touya! I&#39;ll find you!&quot; 

      Shuro brought her fingers to her lips. Letting them rest gently 
for a moment, a seemingly sweet taste lingered there. Even if it was 
only a kiss on the cheek, it felt nice. She shook her head &quot;No... no, 
I&#39;m no a lesbian&quot; she said to herself. &quot;I always say it so it has to be 
true.&quot; She stood up from the floor of the engawa, glancing down the 
hallway down which Aya had run recalling the image of the 16-year-old&#39;s 
slim body as she moved. 

      &quot;She is kinda cute,&quot; Shuro thought, &quot;She has those kawaii eyes and 
that soft blonde hair.&quot; Her own eyes narrowed in deep consideration and 
closed bringing back the recent sight of withdrawing from having just 
kissed Aya on the cheek. Her eyes shot open, &quot;No... no, I am not a 
lesbian... besides... Aya has Touya.&quot; She ran a hand through her black 
hair and sauntered inside. 

      She started towards the kitchen for a soda, but stopped as she 
heard Suzumi&#39;s voice. &quot;Shuro, would you like to join me for tea?&quot; Shuro 
smiled &quot;Of course,&quot; she walked into the room and knelt at the chabudai, 
across from the older woman who poured the matcha into two porcelain 
cups. Shuro looked down into her cup of green tea which she held between 
both hands. 

      Her mind began to wander, she heard Suzumi&#39;s voice but the words 
were indistinguishable to her, it sounded like just a low dull hum. She 
supposed it was talk of legends and the hagoromo as usual, but none of 
it truly registered until Suzumi said. &quot;Shuro, is something wrong?&quot;

      Shuro instantly looked up from her tea, &quot;Oh, er, yeah I&#39;m fine.&quot;

      &quot;You seemed be lost in thought, are you sure there is nothing you 
want to talk about?&quot; The kimono clad woman asked.

      &quot;Well... Suzumi... what do you do if... you think you might be in 
love with someone... but you aren&#39;t sure exactly what to do?&quot;

      &quot;Oh I see, do you have a crush?&quot; Suzumi teased &quot;Who&#39;s the guy?&quot;

      &quot;Oh there&#39;s no guy, I was just curious,&quot; Well it was the truth, 
there was no GUY involved in this. &quot;Just forget I asked,&quot;

      &quot;Well, you&#39;ve had a long trip from Okinawa, why don&#39;t you rest?&quot; 
Suzumi offered

      &quot;Thanks, you&#39;re right I probably am more tired than I know&quot; Shuro 
excused herself from the room. As she walked down the hall towards the 
guest room which she would occupy she confirmed her thoughts, &quot;That&#39;s 
it, I&#39;m tired, that&#39;s what&#39;s going on.&quot; 

      Shuro pulled her shirt over her head, taking a moment to look down 
towards her chest, &quot;Know what?&quot; she asked of the room &quot;I wish my boobs 
were a little bigger... not massive like some of the girls in those 
video games but... just the right size... like Aya&#39;s. Oh god! Why did I 
just think that?!&quot; Shuro shook her head as she unbuttoned her jeans and 
flopped onto her bed in only her underwear, not bothering to pull on her 
pajamas. She let her eyelids close over her eyes as she drifted off to 
sleep.

*~*

      The stars shone brightly and there wasn&#39;t a single cloud in the 
night sky. The moon wasn&#39;t out, just the stars, but the light was so 
bright that they lit up Aya&#39;s soft face. Shuro reached out gently 
caressing Aya&#39;s cheek. A pale blush slipped across Aya&#39;s face but it was 
unseen to Shuro as she smiled at the blonde. Aya gently set her hand on 
Shuro&#39;s keeping it to her cheek.

      The two girls smiled in the star light as Shuro&#39;s hand slipped 
down the side of Aya&#39;s face, down her neck, over her chest and resting 
just above her left breast. Shuro leaned forward pressing her lips to 
Aya&#39;s neck. &quot;Is this the way that Touya did it?&quot; She asked. &quot;Yeah&quot; Aya 
replied as Shuro began sucking on Aya&#39;s neck leaving a deep red hickie 
as her mark. She pulled away looking at Aya now. She smiled as Aya&#39;s 
arms wrapped around her waist and a very loud ringing went off in the 
distance.

*~*

      Shuro&#39;s eyes bolted open and she turned over onto her side, the 
alarm clock next to her bed had just gone off at 4 in the morning. She 
rubbed her eyes, that certainly was an odd time for an alarm clock to be 
set to. Why did it have to wake her from the beautiful dream? No... 
Shuro shook her head, it was a weird dream, not beautiful. She stumbled 
out of bed and into the hallway. It was all quiet in the Aogiri dance 
school as Shuro made her way down the hallway. She paused outside of 
Aya&#39;s room and looked inside. 

      The room was dark, but the longer Shuro stood the more her eyes 
adjusted. She took two steps into the room, already she could tell that 
the room smelled of Aya Mikage. She took a deep breath through her nose. 
It was a sweet wonderful smell. &quot;No... no way&quot; she thought to herself. 
She flopped down on to Aya&#39;s bed and rolled herself up in the sheets 
smiling. She looked over at the pillow, with her eyes closed she saw 
Aya&#39;s smiling face looking deep into her eyes. Shuro wrapped her arms 
around Aya&#39;s pillow and held it to her small breasts wishing it were Aya 
herself enveloped in her arms. &quot;Okay maybe... just maybe-... I am a 
lesbian.&quot;
