<h1>Our Games</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../zoids/index.html">Zoids</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nflugel.html">naomi flugel</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; The youngest member of the Blitz Team was 
leaning over the shoulder of the only female, squinting curiously at 
what could be described as reckless squiggles - her handwriting - upon 
a digital form.

&quot;Sending in a request for a battle.&quot; She stated airily and lifted the 
hand which held the writing utensil, pressing it flat to his face and 
pushing him away.

&quot;Umm, shouldn&#39;t you be consulting your dad, or us with that, before 
hand?&quot; He stood upright, rubbing faintly at his face - a large welt 
spanned from the left side of his jaw to just above his right eye, 
care of the strange pen.

&quot;No.&quot; She responded testily and shot a murderous glare at him. Though, 
still, she resumed furiously writing away at the paper. He still 
didn&#39;t catch the drift, though.

&quot;Leena -&quot; The tone of his voice was dipping into a despairing whine, 
cut short only due to the fact that she shoved violently against the 
ground, sending the chair speeding backwards. It didn&#39;t take very long 
to collide into the front side of the boy, bringing him to yelp and 
wail in pain.

&quot;Jaime! Can you go away? I&#39;m trying to concentrate!&quot; She mockingly 
whined in return and pulled her chair back forward, closer to the 
monitor where she could finish up the form. He made an 
uncharacteristically obscene face at her turned back and hobbled from 
the small room, grasping his stomach and partially limping.

Everyone is so nosey. She thought irritably and brought the cursor 
down to the large, blinking and smile-y face ridden &#39;SEND&#39; button at 
the bottom of the form. Shaking her head at the annoyance her 
teammates caused, she tapped the button and sent the request off.

Patience would prove to be a worthwhile thing, as the request whirled 
about, heading off in whichever direction the Battle Commission had 
imported themselves to. She retreated from the room, gathering up a 
box of cookies, milk, magazines and various other objects that she 
could occupy herself with. It should take an interesting half hour to 
an -

&quot;Lacking components to drool over, Leena?&quot; Naomi&#39;s face was quick to 
pop up within the boundaries of the monitor, her expression a mixture 
of mild curiosity and equally mild annoyance. Leena had an undying 
sense of - who the hell knew what. She simply would not give up!

&quot;No.&quot; Leena answered airily and leaned back within the swivel chair, 
pleased beyond all recognition. Her rival wouldn&#39;t back down, now. 
Naomi&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change, even in the slightest bit, though a 
mild brow- twitch developed above her right eye. &quot;Why? Are you too 
scared, Naomi?&quot;

&quot;Chilled, Leena.&quot; She snapped back and rolled her eyes skyward. People 
could be so childish, sometimes.

&quot;Do you accept?&quot; Leena bore an ear-to-ear smile that would, more than 
likely, frighten even Hades back to his throne in Hell. Naomi looked 
away for the briefest of moments; she assumed it was back in the 
direction where, maybe, Leon was seated. She turned back shortly 
after, returned the smile and inclined her head.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Still smiling, she continued in a less than hushed tone. 
&quot;After all, how could you defeat me with your less-than-perfect 
Gunsniper?&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Leena shoved forward, snarling face inches from the screen. 
Naomi let out a light, concomitant laugh.

&quot;Oh, nothing. I was talking to myself.&quot;

- - - -

&quot;All - teams - accounted - for?&quot; The Judge inquired in confusion, 
after his short-lived speech on the battle mode and clearance areas 
had been finished, its metallic head canting left and right as it made 
an attempt to seek out the participants in the battle. Transparent 
scanners within the head thoroughly searched the heavily forested 
area, through the trees, the rocks, the collapsed building off to the 
far northeast of the Judge&#39;s current position.

There they were! And they were fighting, as well. Settling into his 
cushioned platform, he watched and waited.

What Leena intended to do was beyond Naomi. She seemed less 
enthusiastic with everything. More planned out - more plotted and 
selected properly. Blowing a breath out of the corner of her mouth, 
she gave a tug to her controls, forcing the Gunsniper to easily move 
between the cover of a duo of thick, ancient trees.

The distinct stomping of the other Gunsniper sounded to the left of 
her, not too far into the distance. She grinned and leaned forward to 
flick a switch; the numerous straps holding her secure to the seat 
differentiated from slack to tightly pressed against her body, her 
seat slowly began to incline, until she was flat. Another flick of a 
switch would bring the seat to flip around, the Zoid following in 
synch.

She took grip upon the scope, urging it forward until it was 
comfortable against her face, taking grip upon the controls 
thereafter. Leena was just beyond a shield of trees, twenty, thirty 
yards at the most, in the same vicinity she had been moments before. 
Either Leena had died or accidentally hit herself with one of her own 
missiles; Naomi was going to win and it was far more than just 
apparent.

&quot;Dodge this.&quot; Naomi murmured and began taking aim; there was a small 
slot between a number of trees. If Leena wouldn&#39;t move and if 
everything was on topic, she would have a direct shot at the internal 
computer control system. One shot and it would be knocked out - and 
for quite a long time, at that.

She inhaled slowly and - the other Gunsniper was no longer where it 
previously had been. Maybe this would be harder than she had expected 
it to be.

She waited in her temporary hiding spot, listening for the sound of 
footsteps once more. When they finally sounded behind her, she hardly 
expected a round to be shot off into the back of her scantly concealed 
Zoid.

&quot;Loosing your touch, Naomi?&quot; The holograph popped up to the side of 
her, Leena&#39;s face taunting and that triumphant smile there once more. 
Casting a disdainful look at the screen, Naomi returned the shots with 
a few of her own, before kicking into action - moving out of the boxed 
in space quickly as to keep from being any easy target any longer.

Never in her life would she have expected Leena to not dodge those 
few, though. The shots fired impacted square where she had aimed for, 
the chest, sending it tipping backward as though it had been nothing 
more than a mere, lone leaf in the wind. Taking advantage of this, 
Naomi reeled about once more, took aim, and fired again.

Leena&#39;s Gunsniper barreled backwards and possibly could&#39;ve kept going 
for several meters, if it weren&#39;t for the sturdy line of trees 
blocking her way. The computer of the over equipped Gunsniper beeped 
rhythmically through the holographic image; computer system freeze! 
Naomi was grinning once more as she flicked the switch, her seat 
setting itself back upright. The holographic image followed and when 
it was back in place, she turned and stared defiantly into it.

Leena was still there, not looking entirely mad - or anything else, at 
that. Her head was lolled forward onto her chest, eyes closed. While 
Naomi couldn&#39;t see blood, or any other sign of injury, the situation 
still screamed &#39;wrong!&#39;

Narrowing her eyes, more in a cautious gesture than anything else, 
Naomi shot a precarious glance between the Gunsniper and the screen, 
&quot;Let&#39;s see - what would you say in this situation?&quot; She began 
carefully, tapping a finger against her chin. No response. &quot;Oh. I 
remember! Naomi-chan ichiban ( I am number one! )! Right?&quot;

Still no response came from the other side - not even a mutter, from 
Leena. Well.. the other Zoid was knocked from the battle. Checking on 
her couldn&#39;t cancel out the fact that she had won. Unbuckling the 
safety belts, Naomi heaved herself from her seat and over the side of 
the Zoid, clambering down quickly.

In the distance, she could hear the Judge announcing the win. That was 
a good sign; this would be like - doing it on her own time. Doing 
something good for another person and keeping Leon from going berserk 
over the fact that she could have left his sibling to loll around 
until she regained consciousness. Two good deeds at once!

She grew near the fallen Zoid and stepped precariously over the 
fallen, random pieces of armor, sidling around the arms and muzzle to 
the cockpit. Leena was probably celebrating her win prematurely. That 
was the only viable reason, which could allow Leena to permit such 
damage to the Zoid.

The canopy of the cockpit was faintly cracked and ajar. Through those 
cracks, Leena couldn&#39;t be seen. Not even the faintest of a silhouette 
- nothing. Struck with a sudden feeling of guilt, Naomi frowned and 
stepped around to the back of the Gunsniper&#39;s neck. Due to the impact 
and recoiling, it left a large amount of space between the Zoid and 
the trees.

How Leena had gotten back there was beyond her. She was crumpled over 
herself near the foremost nape of the neck, though still, there wasn&#39;t 
even the faintest sign of injury. Maybe she just - hit her head. Naomi 
continued moving, falling into a balanced crouch between the neck and 
Leena. With one hand, she reached out and prodded gingerly at Leena&#39;s 
shoulder.

Leena was full of surprises, it seemed! With something that sounded 
like a giggle that slipped past the forced suppression, she unfolded 
herself and almost literally leapt towards Naomi. This knocked her out 
of the position she once held, toppling backwards onto her backside, 
now resting against the neck of the Zoid.

&quot;Giving up?&quot; Leena inquired with a bemused grin, leaning forward now 
to lessen the distance between herself and the rival.

Naomi took the initiative to look a mixture of shocked and confused; 
pinned between the ruined side of Leena&#39;s Gunsniper and the abnormally 
close body of her rival was to be considered less than comfortable. 
Okay - so, maybe there was that little feeling somewhere within her 
that defiantly burned, but nonetheless! Her breath quickly caught in 
her throat and she desperately sought an escape route; something to be 
considered on the harder side of things, when Leena&#39;s arms were 
abruptly brought up, one working at untying the high neck of the 
battle costume&#39;s shirt. Once accomplished, she hands secured against 
the Zoid on either side of Naomi&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;Give up?&quot; With her courage rekindled, Naomi gave a lighthearted 
laugh. This was a trick. Something with an obvious ulterior motive 
behind it. Wait -- right? Right?

Leena shook her head and brought her hands down, her fingers 
eventually catching on the tight waistband of Naomi&#39;s shorts. Her 
thumbs kneaded precariously into the flesh, as her fingers feebly 
grasped at Naomi&#39;s wrists.

&quot;You know - admit defeat.&quot; Leena smiled - now, it was different, less 
than frightening. Soft and gentle, like what the proverbial spider 
would use to tempt the fly into its trap. She began leaning forward 
from there, the tips of their noses nearly brushing. &quot;To me.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about -&quot; Naomi began, soon stifled when Leena&#39;s 
head took a swift incline, a number of butterfly kisses trailed along 
her neck from the base of her jaw line to - a rather undetermined 
location. From the depth she urged herself down to, it seemed as 
though she wouldn&#39;t stop.

The action replayed slowly in her world. A curious mixture of fear, 
what if this was seen?!, enjoyment, discontent and contentedment 
blended within her and she found herself wanting to moan aloud, due to 
the sensation. No matter the direction Leena directed the kisses in, 
to-be spasms threatened to wrack her body - she only allowed small, 
faint shivers to take their place. &quot;What are you doing--?&quot;

&quot;You wont admit to defeat,&quot; Leena paused as she spoke, nipping, 
kissing and trailing the tip of her tongue along the delicate patch of 
skin. As she let Naomi absorb that, she continued, inching downward 
toward the narrow collarbone of her &#39;rival.&#39; The last kiss she would 
direct was placed upon the hallow of her throat, before she would rest 
her chin there and tip her head upward, peering through a veil of 
wanton lust and mock curiosity. &quot;So - I might as well congratulate 
you.&quot;

Whether she wanted it - oh, she did! She did! Everything was 
screaming, &#39;yes!&#39; - or not, Leena was going to continue. Tipping her 
head back to its level state, she proceeded with her trail. The skin 
grew even softer, even sweeter, as she dipped downward and by this 
time, Naomi began to writhe.

Naomi&#39;s head swam with her accusations of how very right and wrong 
this was, her body aching with an infuriating sense of nervousness. 
She wasn&#39;t entirely sure when, but Leena had undone the clasps holding 
Naomi&#39;s top secure to her torso; one side of the shirt crumpled 
listlessly over one half of her chest, the rest, and Leena&#39;s current 
center of attention, revealed and trembling with every intake of 
breath.

Leena shifted, balancing her weight upon her heels, between the thighs 
of Naomi; whether she were to remove her hands or not, wouldn&#39;t 
matter. Her knees just about kept Naomi pinned between her body and 
the Zoid. She was quick to lean forward, one hand slipping up from 
Naomi&#39;s waist to cup the subtle curve of her breast, before returning 
to her kisses.

Stuck on the concept of this being a &#39;game,&#39; Naomi could hardly 
believe the situation as Leena&#39;s kissing took an abrupt stop once 
more, her lips curving around the sensitive, hardened nub of her 
nipple. As if it weren&#39;t horrible enough -- remember that defiant, 
burning sensation? It was saying a number of naughty, naughty things 
right this moment.. -- Leena began with her tongue again, applying an 
even, wet pressure with the whole of it, suckling tauntingly in the 
midst of it all.

At this point, Naomi couldn&#39;t help but shift awkwardly, her freed hand 
lifting from the ground to snake around Leena&#39;s neck, holding her as 
secure as she could manage; at this point, even a moan was hard to 
restrain, it slipping out in words due to her still existent 
embarrassment. &quot;Oh, God..&quot;

Leena&#39;s actions still ceased to vanish out of existence. Instead 
taking advantage of this urging on Naomi had taken to doing, lifting 
her other hand from her waist to slip beneath the cover of her top. 
This newly freed hand worked at kneading the soft, gentle flesh, her 
thumb caressing much as her tongue had been that direct moment.

It is a game. Naomi&#39;s mind chanted quietly and tipped her head back, 
her chest pushing forward, her breath coming out in a set of ragged, 
desperate gasps.

If it was a game, why not play along? Her mind abruptly questioned and 
she felt another laugh abruptly catch in her throat. This is intended 
for two players. Her mind stated and, suddenly struck with that 
thought, Naomi&#39;s head lolled and she smiled lopsidedly. With one hand 
still secured about her neck, she brought the other up and lightly 
trailed her fingertips amidst the inside of her right thigh.

Leena&#39;s almost triumphant laugh went muffled as she continued suckling 
and lapping gingerly at her breast. Deciding it was best to stop for a 
brief moment, she freed a hand and cupped Naomi&#39;s jaw, urging herself 
forward to peck lightly about the corners of her mouth, teasing and 
taunting still. She finally, and only, fully pressed her lips upon the 
mouth of her rival when Naomi&#39;s fingers had slid forward the short 
distance, her finger tips rubbing ever so gently across the length of 
her lips through the soft, dyed leather of her battle costume.

The gentle, intimate caress of Naomi&#39;s fingers tips grew into 
something mildly more demanding as Leena withdrew from the kiss, 
unsure of where to return. It took her a short amount of time to make 
up her mind, no less. She shifted her weight once more and began 
repeating her earlier action on the opposite breast, more pressure, 
more -- everything added into it, amidst a chorus of her own hopeful 
groans, brought about by the increasing movement in Naomi&#39;s action.

By this time, Leena was rocking against her fingers, despite the 
burier between them, and Naomi couldn&#39;t help but consider doing 
something horrible.

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Leena forewarned, pleaded, between another moan, as though 
sensing the thought. Once more, she brought herself away from the 
delectable breast and pressed her full weight against the partially 
exposed body of Naomi, capturing her mouth with her own, securing one 
hand upon the other between her thighs. It couldn&#39;t stop. Not yet!

&quot;But --&quot; Naomi breathed as she broke away from the kiss, tipping her 
head to follow the previous actions of her seducer. The stroking 
motion had brought down to a slow, teasing pet care of the help of 
Leena&#39;s hand; she was rather strong for her size, squeezing her hand 
to the point of where it ached, consoled only by those feelings..

A game. Just a game.

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Leena repeated thickly and brought her hands from Naomi in 
full, using the freed one to pull demeaningly at the top of her own, 
strangely assembled costume. With a few unbuckles, a few clasps, and 
the temporary removing of the duo of hands, the skirt fell free and 
pooled about her crouching form.

Now, technically, &#39;freed&#39; from the restraints, Leena guided Naomi&#39;s 
hand once more, bringing the motion back into action.

A game I don&#39;t know how to play. Naomi thought, bemused, as her 
fingers penetrated the set of lips lightly once more. It was easier, 
now; interestingly scented, sticky liquids helped lubricate her 
fingers, allowing them to ease about. Leena, not wanting to have to 
guide the woman through the actions once more, removed her hand, 
cleaning away what had dribbled onto her, simply.

Naomi probed lightly; she couldn&#39;t admit to having done this to anyone 
else before, but.. She eased a duo of fingers toward her entrance, 
more curiously than steadily. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that, still, 
her breaths came in furious panting gasps came steadily against her 
throat, Naomi would have thought the action was being ignored; Leena 
was, once more, dotting butterfly kisses amongst the revealed chest, 
her throat and jaw line, gaining and earning a number of moans.

Naomi shivered as Leena hit an overly sensitive patch of skin and 
urged her fingers forward, deeper.. Leena paused, her lips over the 
area, her breath caught once more as she savored the feeling. Taking 
that as an interestingly good sign, Naomi continued, resuming her 
previous action, though as Leena had silently instructed.

Keeping up with her slow, alluring pace, Naomi was unsure as to 
whether she should have lengthened the motion, or shorten it, or.. 
Either way, Leena had commenced rocking upon the fingers once more, 
panting heavily against her neck, nuzzling her nose and lips in a 
feeble attempt to match the stimulation.

She couldn&#39;t admit to it being fully mutual, though the sight, the 
simple, desperate noises were enough to sate that temporary need; the 
burning, on the other hand, was by far getting worse. She could feel 
her face growing red as she pushed, the thick liquids seeping onto her 
hands, trickling messily down her wrist.

Leena&#39;s groans grew louder and, instead of tipping back, secured her 
arms firmly about Naomi&#39;s neck, clasping her hands against her elbows. 
If it weren&#39;t for the whole &#39;sexual intimacy&#39; deal, it probably would 
have looked like Leena was strangling her! She muttered something 
thickly into the side of her neck about, possibly, &#39;no more kissing,&#39; 
and began nipping a bit harder than before; her focus was to bruise!

Naomi&#39;s face contorted into easily sated pain and she brought her one 
hand down from Leena&#39;s neck to snake it loosely around her waist. 
While the action proved to be of no use, her fingering surely had. The 
biting had stopped and she had began whimpering, groaning, crying out 
into the side of her neck, pausing only to shakily kiss at the area 
she had injured, as though in a gesture of apology.

She didn&#39;t expect Leena to reach her limit so hastily, though she had 
-- Naomi held a strange sense of satisfaction at this, too. The last 
few strokes had caused her to tense up incredibly around her fingers, 
her body rigid and yet trembling in determination. When she had began 
to withdraw and push once more, Leena cried out sharply and climaxed; 
those same thick, salty liquids spilling over her fingers, soaking 
Naomi&#39;s palm.

That feeling deep within the pit of her stomach didn&#39;t get any better 
after that. She ached in heated discomfort as Leena collapsed against 
her and panted once again, seemingly unable to make even the faintest 
of movements for the moment.

&#39;Moment,&#39; being the keyword, of course. Determined to do something 
completely beyond Naomi&#39;s knowledge, she shifted, one hand sliding 
between the both of them to retrieve the hand her rival had once used. 
Now, tending to her own agenda, she suckled lightly upon the length of 
her fingers, cleansing the added liquids away.

Oh, God. As if that made anything feel even remotely better. Naomi 
exhaled slowly and closed her eyes, tipping her head back against the 
Zoid; she was going to scream if this feeling didn&#39;t go away! Leena 
glanced up through half-lidded eyes, finishing with the index finger 
and trailing down to the palm. Though, she wouldn&#39;t pay much attention 
to that, sparing a single, feathery kiss upon the center of the palm.

&quot;Something wrong, Naomi?&quot; Once more, her voice had gained a taunting, 
typical tone; she shifted and now knelt between Naomi&#39;s knees, the 
index finger upon her left hand tracing an intricate pattern along the 
exposed, sweat-sheen&#39;ed valley between her breasts. Naomi&#39;s head 
lulled and she bit her bottom lip, nodding slowly, as though being 
forced to agree to a grudging matter.

&quot;D&#39;you want me to fix it?&quot; A grin now accompanied the taunting, almost 
annoying tone. Leena had moved to lean forward, kissing once at the 
area between the top of her ribs, moving lower to flutter another upon 
the skin, just above the belly button. Even lower she went, placing 
once more upon her navel. Still biting her lip, looking as though she 
would draw blood, Naomi nodded once more.

Leena released the hand she had been holding and canted her head at 
the hot pants scantly encasing the bottom half of her object of 
desire. Much like the top, a duo of clasps was secured upon the side, 
holding the shorts up -- it wasn&#39;t as though they were even halfway 
necessary, though. The snug tightness held them secure alone, most 
likely.

She fingered idly at the top clasp before undoing it, gaining a final 
noise of recognition from Naomi. Had she realized what, exactly, was 
about to go about, or -- just, what? Either way, Leena continued, 
undoing the second clasp.

She, apparently, did know what was about to go on, because the hand 
Leena once held captive moved up, her thumb and index finger slid 
between the waistband in a half-way attempt to help it down. Leena&#39;s 
giggle went unstifled as she aided in the removal of the artical with 
a sole hand; the other was encircling Naomi&#39;s leg from around the 
knee, further aiding in the removal.

Leena, much to Naomi&#39;s gasping, almost squealing surprise, took no 
time in teasing, immediately dipping back in to tentatively kiss at 
the lips. Either this was helping the burning or making it worse; her 
face grew flushed and she wiggled, trying to do something about this.

Instead of her finger, Leena&#39;s tongue slid through the moist lips and 
probed about, sampling, tasting the liquids once more. The wiggling 
came to an abrupt stop at this and Naomi gasped; out of complete 
instinct she found herself drawing her legs in towards her body, 
spreading her thighs enough to ensure the continuation of this action.

And, Leena didn&#39;t stop. She trailed her tongue along the area between 
her lips and brought a hand up, circling the tip of her index finger 
in the moisture upon her lips, just outside her entrance. Naomi 
groaned and sighed, lowering a hand upon the top of Leena&#39;s head, 
tangling her fingers within the choppy strands as she lightly held her 
head in place.

Leena dipped the finger within her and quickly took to swiftly pumping 
inside of her, tipping her head upward, her teeth grazing lightly 
against the nub. She seemed to revile within the equally desperate 
noises that emitted from Naomi as she repeated the process still, 
stopping only to secure her lips over the nub and lap and suck once 
more.

&quot;Lee-na..&quot; Naomi purred and arced her back, lifting her other hand to 
secure it over the one already upon the back of Leena&#39;s head, pressing 
her face further down, begging for more in a rather simple, two 
syllables.

Who was she to not oblige? Adding another finger upon entry and 
lapping even more so delicately at the nub, trailing down and up, and 
up and down. Naomi whined in her bout of pleasure and shivered, her 
muscles tightening with the added friction. Leena paid no mind; 
fingering and kissing and lapping all too hopefully.

That feeling was brimming within her and it was going to spill and 
become sated, in Naomi&#39;s opinion, far too quickly. Naomi&#39;s fingers 
curled about the hair tighter than it had earlier and she inhaled 
sharply. Leena took this as a signal, thankful for her previous 
tauntings, and withdrew her fingers, clamping her lips about the 
nearly sopping body part, still prodding and tickling at the nub with 
the tip of her tongue.

Naomi went to the extent of pulling haplessly at Leena&#39;s hair, 
subconsciously, of course, as she tipped her head back and cried out 
sharply, her back arcing once more as the feeling expelled from her in 
a swift release, leaving her body tingling, as though she had just 
woke from a year long dream. Of course, if one could exclude the fact 
that her body was screaming for sleep.

Her fingers untangled from the hair as Leena began to draw back, 
licking tentatively at her lips, wiping at her chin, just in case. 
Naomi&#39;s legs clamped shut and hung lazily to the side, partially 
hiding what had previously been revealed. She paid no absolute 
attention as Leena loosely heaved herself back to her feet and began 
the process of pulling her clothes back on.

&quot;Congratulations.&quot; Leena quipped with a sense of finality as, now 
fully clothed, she leaned forward and kissed Naomi once more. She had 
tasted sweet before, though now.. Naomi gave a lazy smile as Leena 
rightened herself, pulling her own bottom lip into her mouth, 
relishing the flavor.

- - - -

&quot;What took you?&quot; Leon&#39;s head popped in through the partially opened 
door of the bathroom, peering through the thick, heavy white haze to 
find his redheaded companion.

&quot;Nothing; I&#39;ve been here for a while.&quot; Naomi stepped out of the 
condensation, clothed in a towel and patting down her hair carefully. 
He shot a grin at her and turned his gaze away, still having a sense 
of chivalry within him. A brow quirked in partial disbelief -- it 
wasn&#39;t like he hadn&#39;t seen her in this before! -- and she laid the 
towel flat over the top of her head, rubbing and patting down the 
sides gently. &quot;What took you?&quot;

&quot;I stopped by home for a minute.&quot; He focused on something in the hall; 
probably the kitchen, or who knew what. Though, he was still grinning 
away and this partially worried her.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Still patting down the top and sides of her hair, she turned her 
back on him and focused on a mirror somewhere in the North-east 
region.

&quot;Mmhm.&quot; He nodded and pursed his lips as though trying to restrain 
something. &quot;Leena said she won?&quot;

&quot;She -- ohh! No, no.&quot; She brought her fingers through the tips of her 
hair, turning and shooting an incredulous look back at him. &quot;Check the 
records yourself! I won.&quot;

&quot;I did.&quot; He rubbed at the back of his head and turned back to look at 
her, his expression confused. &quot;She doesn&#39;t like losing and she said 
you even wrecked her system; I&#39;m just wondering why she&#39;s so -- 
happy.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Leena.&quot; She shot back and shrugged, reaching forward to take a 
hold of a brush. She waved it around concomitantly. &quot;She probably 
found a new cookie shop, or something.&quot; </pre>
