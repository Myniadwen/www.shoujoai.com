<pre>Chapter one: Arrival 

&quot;Why me,&quot; Rika sighed to herself.  It seemed like she was surrounded by 
idiots.  Okay well only one of them was an idiot, and the others where 
too wrapped up in each other to realize there was an outside world.  
Maybe she was just jealous, but that is not what she thought.  &quot;Are you 
guys about done?&quot; she asked with her usual tone.

Takato stopped kicking his soccer ball and looked over at her face.  
&quot;What&#39;s up with you?&quot;  Suddenly an evil smile took his face, &quot;I mean if 
you keep frowning, the wrinkles will get worse.&quot; Zoe and Jerri took a 
short enough break from kissing so that they could laugh.

Rika shot all of them a glare, &quot; I don&#39;t have any wrinkles,&quot; she 
yelled.  

&quot;Hey what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;  Zoe asked, keeping a secure grip on 
Jerri.


&quot;Nothing, never mind,&quot; Rika sighed with a sad look on her face.  She 
turned to the side of the bridge and looked up towards the sky to stare 
at the night sky.  (Why do I have to put with these three)?  She 
couldn&#39;t think of a reason, she just couldn&#39;t no matter how hard she 
tried.  Some times she would lay in bed awake, wondering why, she put 
up with their antics.  

&quot;Hey, Zoe look at that,&quot; Jerri said, removing her left arm from the 
young blonds shoulder and pointing into the sky.  

&quot;Wow,&quot; Zoe cooed, &quot;What is it?&quot;

Rika looked into the sky to see what they where staring at. A small red 
dot was in the center, and it looked as if it were growing larger.

&quot;I dunno,&quot; Jerri said, still staring at it, &quot;But isn&#39;t it beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Balicimo,&quot; Zoe yelled aloud into Jerri&#39;s ear before both of them 
started kissing again.  

&quot;Hey Rika...&quot; Takato started, but she started to zone him out.

(Wow, it is amazing)  She couldn&#39;t take her eyes off it. The red dot 
grew larger as the object was closing in on the bridge.

&quot;O man, lets go,&quot; Takato warned before running off.  Zoe and Jerri 
closely fallowed him.  But Rika didn&#39;t move.  She stood there and 
waited for the large red orb to collide with the Earth. Which it did.  
The large rd orb crashed into the bridge, causing it to crumble into 
dust.  As the bridge collapsed from under her Rika flew into the air. 
Then she fell with the orb into the water.

(What the hell is going on?)  Rika woke up to find a young woman with 
red hair kissing her.  She blushed instantly and pushed her away.  
&quot;What the hell are you doing,&quot; the young orange haired woman yelled 
once her mouth was free. 

&quot;CPR&quot; she said almost robotically.  After explaining her actions she 
stood up and looked around, &quot;Life...LIFE!&quot; she shrieked loudly.

???Rika stared at her wondering what she was doing.  &quot;Umm, who are 
you?&quot;

&quot;Who am me?&quot; the girl repeated, jumping up and down, &quot;me am Spin, who 
am you??&quot;

&quot;My name is Rika,&quot; she replied.

&quot;Rika&#39;s a freaka!&quot; Spin said spontaneously.  Then she ran over to a fox 
that was walking down the street.  She hit it over the head and it 
transformed.  Now it was a fox-human with yellow and white fur.  On its 
arms rested two purple sleeves with ying- yangs on them.  &quot;You Renamon! 
You protect Rika!&quot; she yelled in a caveman like tone.

&quot;What the hell,&quot; was the only thing Rika could think or say.  Renamon 
walked over and watched Rika.  &quot;So you are my guardian or something?&quot;

&quot;It appears so.&quot; 

Rika looked at her new partner, &quot;can you tell me who that girl is?&quot; she 
asked, pointing at the pink hair girl who was dancing around the edge 
of the street.

&quot;I truly do not know miss Rika.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s jus Rika.&quot;

Renamon looked into her eyes to make sure she was serious before 
nodding slightly.  

It was late at night when Renamon snuck Rika into her house.  Rika 
showered and readied for bed.  &quot;Where are you going to be?&quot; Rika asked 
Renamon, who watched her the whole time.

&quot;I will watch you sleep.&quot;

&quot;Right...&quot;  

Rika woke up to the morning sun.  Her eyes where open but still 
slightly closed, and the events of last night were replaying in her 
head.  Rika stared over at the corner where Renamon stood last night 
when she went to sleep.  Her fox like guardian was nowhere.  &quot;Renamon?&quot; 
she whispered so she would not wake her sister, whom slept downstairs.  

Suddenly a shadow like figure leapt into the room and stood by Rika&#39;s 
bed.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry I am here.&quot;

Rika yawned and stretched before brushing her hair, &quot;I wasn&#39;t worried.&quot;  
After combing her hair she dressed in her usual clothing with the 
broken heart on it. &quot;I was just curious.&quot;

&quot;Rika!&quot; her sister&#39;s voice shrieked from down stairs.

Rika turned blue in the face, &quot;Umm you wait here,&quot; she commanded before 
running downstairs.  When she went into the living room she stopped 
cold.  Spin stood there kissing her sister. &quot;What the hell?&quot;

Rika&#39;s sister, Amber, shoved Spin on the couch and looked at Rika.  
&quot;She says she knows you.&quot;

The small red head looked around blankly before the girl came back into 
her head.  &quot;Well she kind does.&quot;

Amber looked at the Pink haired girl who was lying with her arms spread 
on the back of the couch.  She looked back at her sister, &quot;I like her,&quot; 
and with that said Amber leapt on the girl and they started kissing 
again.

Rika stared blankly at the sight.  Renamon appeared from nowhere and 
stood next to her person.  &quot;What are they doing,&quot; the fox asked.

&quot;I am gonna go vomit,&quot; Rika yelled while running to the bathroom.

&quot;Vomit Comet,&quot; Spin yelled before her and Amber started kissing again.
            
Renamon fallowed Rika to the bathroom and watched her as she vomited in 
the toilet. &quot;Are you going to be okay??&quot;

Rika stopped vomiting at wiped her mouth off with a towel, &quot;I will be 
fine.&quot;

&quot;So who is that woman out there?&quot;

&quot;That is my sister slash guardian,&quot; Rika explained mildly. Rika left 
the bathroom, while being closely fallowed by her fox like guardian.  
She walked into the living room to find her sister still on Spins lap 
and them still kissing.  &quot;Amber...AMBER!&quot; she yelled, but her attempt to
get her attention failed.  Rika shoved Amber off the girl, &quot;Amber!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Amber gasped.

&quot;If she is gonna stay here, then she needs to mellow a little, she is 
way to loud.&quot;

Amber looked at Spin, who was currently massaging her foot.  &quot;I guess 
your right.&quot;

&quot;So she is staying here,&quot; Rika whined.

&quot;Yep I like Spin.&quot;

&quot;Spins Fin,&quot; Spin yelled suddenly before tackling Amber and kissing her 
again.  

&quot;Right,&quot; Rika sighed, while walking up the stairs to her room.  &quot;What 
is wrong heartbreaker?&quot;

&quot;Heart breaker?&quot; Rika repeated.

&quot;Your shirt,&quot; Renamon explained.

&quot;Oh, nothing is wrong,&quot; she answered lamely.  The red head walked over 
to her bed and fell down on it.  &quot;Another boring Saturday at home.&quot;  
Her eyelids closed quickly as she rested her feet on the ground.

Renamon stood in her corner, &quot;Are you okay,&quot; Renamon asked.  She had 
been worrying about Rika since the bathroom incident, and the question 
that she had been wondering was still in her head.  Why did she get so 
sick suddenly?  

Rika rolled over in her bed and sighed.  Why wont any one leave me 
alone she thought to her self.  &quot;I am fine, just taking a nap.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I wish you good dreams.&quot;

Rika sighed as her head found a pillow.  &quot;Ya thanks.&quot;


Milky Way Galaxy Castle-

&quot;So lady Subaru, what is your command again?&quot; the red haired assassin, 
Naomi asked her with a bow.

Subaru sat up in her chair and wiped her blue hair to the side, &quot;I am 
asking you to bring Miss Spin back to Mimiru and I.&quot;

Suddenly Naomi&#39;s violent other half appeared from behind her lover, &quot;Is 
that all?&quot;  Leena had a need from shooting and violence for some 
reason.  The only thing that could keep her calm was Naomi, and some 
times it didn&#39;t always work.  

&quot;Yes,&quot; Subaru answered simply, &quot;Please bring my daughter back.&quot;  Mimiru 
and Subaru&#39;s daughter, who ran away one week ago, which caused both, 
parents much pain. 

Naomi pushed Leena out the door with a smile, &quot;Okay, we except your 
mission,&quot; she said as they left. 


Earth-

Takato kicked the soccer ball up into the air and readied him self to 
head it as it came back down.  I can do it, I can do it, he thought to 
himself.  As the ball started to fall a large red orb hit the ball, and 
melted it instantly.  Takato was thrown back from the shock wave that 
the speed left in its wake.  After it flew by the sonic boom appeared 
as well.  &quot;What was that,&quot; Takato asked to no one.  He ran over to the 
crater that the orb created, &quot;Wow, this is just like the one that hit 
last night.&quot;  Suddenly little girl with black hair leapt from the 
smoldering hole.  Behind her fallowed a large red lizard with triangles 
on it.  &quot;Who are you??&quot;

The girl laughed before answering.  &quot;I am Fate,&quot; she said simply, &quot;and 
this is Guilmon.&quot;

&quot;Right..&quot; Takato said distantly.  Who the hell is this girl? Truthfully 
Takato didn&#39;t care, all he could think really was, wow. He knew that 
she was an alien, and he knew that the same thing happened to Rika.  
Rika!  She might know what the hell is going on!


Rika&#39;s house-

Renamon sat in the corner watching Rika sleep.  She admired her natural 
beauty.  Even when she frowned she was so beautiful.  Rika was 
Renamon&#39;s little heartbreaker, or that is how Renamon looked at it.  
Rika didn&#39;t really have an opinion of Renamon yet.  She probably never 
will have much of one o her. Its not that she dislikes her, it was just 
Rika&#39;s way.

Amber sat back and sighed, &quot;No you just don&#39;t have to yell all the 
time,&quot; she attempted to explain again.

Spins, already red eyes teared up again, &quot;So you are saying you hate 
me&quot; Spin repeated for about the ninth time.  

No matter how many times Amber tried to explain it, Spin didn&#39;t 
understand.  &quot;No I don&#39;t hate you, it just hurts my ears, ya that&#39;s 
right, and it hurts my ears.&quot;

Spin stopped crying and sniffled once.  &quot;So if I stop will you love 
me?&quot;

&quot;Well love is a strong word.&quot;  The pink haired aliens eyes were tearing 
up again.  &quot;Not again,&quot; she thought.  &quot;I will love you if you stop 
yelling so much,&quot; Amber responded quickly.

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Amber said as sincerely as possible, and it seemed to trick 
Spin, who suddenly lashed out and hugged Amber.  &quot;So can we kiss and 
make out...I mean up?&quot;

Then Spin got it, &quot;So you only like to kiss me?&quot;

&quot;No, but it is very fun,&quot; Amber explain, to no one.  Spin fell asleep 
on top of Amber who actually didn&#39;t mind.   She found Spin very cute 
when she was asleep.  She also felt at peace with Spin, maybe she 
really does love, or maybe it is really lust.  What ever it was, she 
liked it.


Rika&#39;s room-  

The little heart breaker sat up and looked around the room. Nothing 
changed.  Renamon still sat in that corner, the window was still 
closed, everything was the same, like everyday.  She stood and went to 
the door, &quot;You hungry,&quot; she asked with out turning.

Renamon looked over and opened her eyes, she hadn&#39;t realized that Rika 
was awake, &quot;Minor hunger, but I should be okay.&quot;

Rika opened the door before turning, &quot;Lets go get something to eat, I 
am starved.&quot;

Renamon scratched her head curiously then fallowed her new person.  
Once she reached the bottom of the stairs Rika saw Amber with Spin 
lying on top of her, drooling.  &quot;Oh how cute,&quot; Rika laughs, while 
making her way threw the living room and into the kitchen.  &quot;So what do 
you want to eat?&quot; she asked her fox like protector.  This was Rika&#39;s 
first real pet.

&quot;What ever you will feed me.&quot;

Rika looked at her for a minute, then she got the cold macaroni, &quot;This 
should do.&quot;  She grabbed two forks and walked back up stairs.  But not 
before laughing at Amber and Spin.  


Earth Orbit- 

A large black ship blasted threw space.  Close behind it fallowed a 
lime green sword shaped ship.  &quot;Stop now Raven,&quot; the black ships 
intercom raged.  Reese walked over to it and turned it off.

&quot;We don&#39;t have much time,&quot; she complained, running her hand threw her 
light blue hair.  They couldn&#39;t out run those two for ever, she knew it 
and she knew he knew it.  But the black haired pilot kept his cool, 
like he always did.  &quot;Raven we&#39;re going to fly right into that planet!&quot; 
she screamed at him.

A creepy smirk found its way onto his face.   &quot;What are you expecting 
me to do?&quot; the pale skinned pilot asked his co-pilot. &quot;If we are going 
to escape those two, we need to do something completely insane,&quot; he 
explained with his creepy smile.  Suddenly he pushed a switch with his 
left hand the ship sped forward, colliding with Earth&#39;s atmosphere.

&quot;Oh God what or those two on,&quot; Moonbay yelled from the pilot&#39;s seat.  
She stopped the ship quickly so that they would not follow their crazy 
path.

Pheona walked over to Moonbay and put her arms around her, &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
love, we will get them,&quot; she said before placing a gentle kiss on her 
lover&#39;s cheek.</pre>
