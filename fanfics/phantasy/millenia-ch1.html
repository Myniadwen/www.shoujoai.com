<h1>Millenia</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../phantasy/index.html">Phantasy Star</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/drenden.html">Drenden Shirotu</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She looked about her surroundings as the faint crackles of electricity
could be heard and echoed gently throughout the long corridors of where
her &#39;father&#39; - the supercomputer known as &#39;Seed&#39; - resided over. Of
course, Rika had known since birth that Seed also had control over all
of Motavia, ensuring that she be prosperous.

But of course, Rika and Seed both knew it was a dangerous world outside
now. The bio-monsters were plaguing the outside world, probably having
already killed hundreds if not thousands by now. Rika had always wanted
to venture outside and try to at least defeat one of those monsters,
but Seed always said that she had to stay within the safe confines by
her &#39;father&#39;s&#39; side. Seed assured Rika that someday she would see the
outside world but for now would have to settle for the various records
and memories of such things inside &#39;his&#39; archives. Rika appreciated
it..but it never felt fully alive, she could &quot;pick up&quot; a flower, but it
would never &quot;feel&quot; right. Even sights and sounds familiar to her -
steel, grey, crackling, electricity, computer screens - never looked or
sounded real. She could live with what she had, but not for much
longer...

* * *

Once again, Rika entered her &quot;bed&quot;. It was really more of some sort of
giant test tube with various wires and technical apparatuses sticking
out of it like worms in the ground, though the overall design vaguely
resembled an egg on a giant writhing mechanical nest of wires.

Rika&#39;s approach made the door of the &quot;bed&quot; open up to allow enterance
to a fairly cozy little space, it was lined with a fairly soft material
which allowed for fairly comfortable rest periods. At the head of the
&quot;bed&quot; was a small compartment which automatically opened whenever Rika
wanted to go into Seed&#39;s memory banks and search for any memories, or
general information about places, things, and events in the Algol solar
system.

Rika let out a sigh as she step toward the tube, once again having
endured a long &quot;day&quot; (&#39;Is it..daytime or..nighttime outside?&#39; Rika
pondered briefly). She quickly brushed her long red hair lightly with
her fingers as she entered the &#39;egg&#39;. She layed her head back as she
looked outside of the tube, seeing yet again the constant grey and
black that resided in her life as she closed her eyes once again.

&#39;Enter Archives&#39; Rika commanded with her thoughts. The compartment
suddenly opened as some flat-ended wires started squirming out of their
prison and latching onto various parts of Rika&#39;s head and body very
tightly as a dim green light glowed softly over her. Rika simply kept
her eyes closed and dozed off...

* * *

She opened her eyes, or did she? She never really knew it was ever her
own eyes opening and closing. Regardless, she was in the place known as
&quot;The Archives&quot;. The &#39;room&#39; (such a loose term really, as the place
really had no walls, boundaries or even a ground) was a place where all
of Seed&#39;s knowledge and records were kept. The surroundings were very
colorful, especially when compared to the Bio-Lab. Rika was essentially
floating amongst a place which had constantly flucuating colors as
various images of events, people, and locales floated around. Having
lived for less than a year yet with a body that was at least that of a
17 year old, she had yet to explore the entire Archives. It was
somewhat comforting to her, really, that she didn&#39;t know everything
that ever was and ever to be, but yet it rather saddened her that she
didn&#39;t know as much as she thought she should. She had a good knowledge
of events of the past such as the Fall of LaShiec and the destruction
of Parma but she didn&#39;t something that seems so simple like the true
beauty of a flower.

She became lost in her thoughts as well as the Archives. She was simply
meandering about, seeing as she wasn&#39;t in her classes with Seed. She
saw various pieces of memories and events as they were stuck in their
eternal loop, repeating over and over again as they floated by. She
heard voices of many individuals throughout the ages, yammering on
constantly in her &quot;ears&quot;.

Suddenly, she saw a very peculiar yet strangely familar figure. A very
young, pretty face with red eyes framed by lovely purple hair that
reached to about the same length as Rika&#39;s and accented by very long,
vaguely feline ears, this girl wore a purple leotard which accented her
rather curvaceous figure along with long boots that reached up to her
knees. She was standing, unmoving with a rather sad expression in her
eyes. Rika very eagerly and curiously &quot;swam&quot; past the other information
in her to this curious figure who resembled her in so many ways. Maybe
she wouldn&#39;t be so lonely anymore?

Rika&#39;s thoughts commanded the computer to give her information on the
girl.

&quot;Name: Nei. Species: Numan. Information: The first of the Numan
project, she existed 1000 years ago, she was created by Seed, the
Artificial Intelligence on Motavia.&quot; The voice droned in it&#39;s
unmistakeably mechanical sound.

&#39;Any memory files on her?&#39; Rika asked.

&quot;Yes. Memory files are available.&quot;

Rika wasted no time to access the data files as she suddenly found the
&quot;world&quot; around her warp and distort..all of the other bits and pieces
of floating information suddenly dissapeared, leaving only Nei standing
there.

Suddenly, what at first seemed like a floating, two-dimensional image
standing in the vast black expanse suddenly began to move very
suddenly, quickly and fluidly, as if she had never been in this
apparently statsised in the stream of information. It was a short but
graceful spin that stopped with Nei staring right at Rika.

&quot;Who....who are you?&quot; The purple-haired one asked, her voice somewhat
shaky, unfamiliar with the fact that she has been archived for all
these years.

&quot;My name is Rika. I believe you are..Nei?&quot; Rika replied, suddenly
surprised by how similar her voice was to Nei&#39;s.

The other girl merely &#39;stepped back&#39; slightly and crouched down rather
scared of her current situation..&quot;W-w-where am I!?&quot;

&quot;You..are inside a computer. I found you stored here..&quot; Rika slowly
&#39;stepped&#39; closer to Nei. Nei merely looked on..calming down
significantly, but still not completely at ease. Rika could see this in
Nei&#39;s purple eyes.

&#39;Seed, load &#39;room&#39; - Motavian living room.&#39; Rika&#39;s thoughts raced to
Seed&#39;s CPU which almost immediately loaded up a much more standard - as
far as Rika knew/was concerned at least - room. Nei suddenly found
herself holding against a fairly solid-feeling cabinet which felt like
wood.

&quot;What did you do!?&quot; Nei&#39;s voice was still trembling, but she still
stood up looking around her surroundings with awe.

&quot;Like I said, we are inside a massive super-computer.&quot; Rika replied.

&quot;Like..Mother Brain?&quot; Nei&#39;s eyes grew wide.

&quot;Something like that I would suppose,&quot; Rika had learned about the
Mother Brain incident from Seed, &quot;But this computer is called Seed..&quot;

&quot;Seed...&quot; Nei started coming closer to Rika, &quot;Umm....Ri..ka..why do you
look so much like me?&quot; Nei pointed to her own ears then playfully
tugged on Rika&#39;s with a smile, already realizing that this girl meant
no harm, but still feeling a little shy.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t really know very well myself..&quot; Rika looked down at Nei
wrapping her arms around her.

&quot;I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter much..what day is it?&quot; She asked, still
feeling incredibly disoriented.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure about the exact day..but I can tell you we&#39;re in the year
AW 2283...&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?!&quot; Nei looked up at Rika in shock, suddenly squeezing her, her
disorientation immediately going away. &quot;How am I back here after nearly
a thousand years?! I..I think..I swear I died even...&quot;

&quot;I..think your memories are backed up in this computer, although you
seem more than just a sim.&quot;

Indeed, Rika actually felt this rather lovely girl to be more than a
mere simulation or piece of data stored within memory. Nei&#39;s touch felt
very warm and &quot;real&quot; to Rika&#39;s mind.

&quot;Well..I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter much. My information was probably
acquired from the cloning labs.&quot; Nei&#39;s voice trailed off and slowly
placed her head just above Rika&#39;s bosom. Nei was actually able to hear
Rika&#39;s heartbeat, it&#39;s gentle rhythm helped to relax her remaining
worries.

Rika ran her fingers through Nei&#39;s luscious hair. Rika smiled, looking
down at Nei.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to find another like myself.&quot; Rika said, feeling a bizarre
sensation at realizing Nei was rubbing her back. Rika didn&#39;t mind, it
felt warm, certainly much warmer than the various other digital
&quot;memories&quot; and simulations she had looked through before.

Nei merely smiled in response to Rika&#39;s little utterance as she nuzzled
softly between Rika&#39;s breasts. The red-haired girl&#39;s facial color
slowly came to match her hair, she was not incredibly familar with
these experiences, much less with a woman, only once had she ever seen
a memory stored within Seed that contained an act of any sort of sexual
activity between humanoids and even then it was a Parman male and
female. Any other sort of confusion was cut short by Nei&#39;s lips
contacting with hers. Rika tried recalling the file she saw and slipped
her tounge past Nei&#39;s mouth. Nei pulled back as gently as possible.

&quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; Nei asked in a tone that indicated
she was asking herself this question just as much as she was to Rika.
&quot;I apparently can&#39;t join you back to the real world.&quot;

Rika&#39;s eyes watered up slightly, her hand clinging gently to Nei&#39;s
right shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t think about that, I&#39;m sure Seed can make you
real, someday..and at least for now, we won&#39;t have to be lonely..&quot;

Rika kissed Nei again, this time with more passion and intensity, her
hands gently grasping the sides of her head. Nei wrapped her arms
around Rika&#39;s waist and returned Rika&#39;s kiss, their tounges going in a
sort of a waltz. Rika gripped Nei&#39;s shoulder more tightly..all the
while noticing just how -real- she felt. She *loved* the sensations she
was feeling, the touch of Nei&#39;s lips felt far warmer than even the
&#39;hottest&#39; cup of Dezolian tea she could find in the simulations would
never be able to match. The sensations felt *real* to her mind, even if
they weren&#39;t, but she couldn&#39;t let such trivial details matter to her
in this moment where, for once, her lonliness seemed to have gone away.
Not even communication with Demi and Wren compared to this...

Nei started to slip off her red-haired companion&#39;s black suit, Rika
didn&#39;t complain at all as she felt Nei&#39;s silky hands run down her
sides. Nei felt her breast be gently squeezed, her slight cry of
surprise sent an shockwave through Rika as she abruptly stopped and
embraced her.

&quot;Did I hurt you?!&quot; she cried out, ashamed of her action.

Nei kissed Rika&#39;s nose, &quot;Silly, you didn&#39;t..even then, I&#39;m supposedly
only a simulation..or at least that&#39;s what this..place has been telling
you I am..&quot; She put her head between Rika&#39;s already-unclothed breasts.
Rika swore that she felt each individual strand of that amazingly soft
purple hair on her chest in such a way that she had never felt anything
else. She twitched as Nei started to lick it like a cat to it&#39;s mother.
Shortly after, Nei&#39;s licking started to turn more forceful. Before
long, Nei&#39;s lips were forming a vacuum around her nipple, sucking
firmly but gently. Rika&#39;s gentle moans could be picked up by the room&#39;s
audio feedback. Nei grabbed Rika&#39;s rear, feeling it&#39;s firmness and
contours. Nei glided her hands from her rear to around her waist to
finish taking off Rika&#39;s clothes. Naturally, the Numan accellerated
growth process gave Rika a tuft of red hair in her pelvic region. Rika,
not quite understanding how Nei would go about this, gently pushed her
onto the bed nearby. Rika kicked off her boots as she settled on top of
Nei, working at revealing her body.

It took a while, but once finished with exposing Nei&#39;s body to the
artificial, wind-less, odor-less enviroment. However, this wasn&#39;t the
drawback it would seem to be, for it allowed Nei to feel absolutely
nothing except Rika&#39;s hands on her chest, slowly fondling her breasts.
Nei&#39;s ears twitched a bit at the warm touch of Rika&#39;s hands, her eyes
instinctively closing to further concentrate on the touch. Rika tweaked
Nei&#39;s erect nipples between her index and middle fingers, smiling
gently down at her. Rika also noticed that Nei&#39;s lower regions were
significantly glistening from her fluids. In her naivete, she was about
to try to reenact the actions she had seen in that file about the
reproductive habits of the male/females of various parman species.
Luckily, before Rika could make a fool of herself, she decided instead
to swiftly move down Nei&#39;s body, her tounge barely scraping the surface
of the purple-haired girl&#39;s skin.

Nei wholeheartedly welcomed Rika&#39;s tounge within her inner walls, her
long fingers shifting through that wonderful red hair of hers. Nei&#39;s
moans and squeaks of delight were only encouraged by that tounge
probing deeper and deeper, massaging her delicate insides and indulging
on her nectar. The computers running this scene amusingly decided to
have Nei&#39;s taste akin to that of soft creamy vanilla. Nei allowed Rika
to spread her legs a bit farther as Rika&#39;s soft licks became somewhat
harsher, her tempo becoming increasingly faster. The red-head&#39;s moans
were muffled but they sent shockwaves through Nei&#39;s body, her moans
sounding _quite_ pleasured by Rika&#39;s tounge.

Rika slowly pulled her tounge out of Nei, trailing behind juices which
Rika gladly drank from as well. Nei&#39;s heavy breathing after her moaning
had eased clearly indicated to Rika that she did not mind the pleasure
at all. Rika climbed on top of her purple-haired partner, her green
eyes piercing through Nei&#39;s red ones. Nei held Rika&#39;s head close to her
right shoulder above her soft, sizeable breast. Rika lightly kissed it
with a bit of a sensual squeak. The squeak suddenly turned a surprised
squeal as she felt two of Nei&#39;s long, slender fingers penetrate her.
Nei kissed Rika, her tounge slithering inside of the safe confines of
her warm mouth. The fingers softly slid in and out being hugged closely
by Rika, allowing her to fully appreciate the sensation of that silky
skin.

&quot;N..Nei...&quot; Were the words that barely slipped out of Rika&#39;s lips
before she the squeak became a moan and held even tighter to Nei&#39;s
body, sucking on her tounge, softly squeezing her breasts.

Nei&#39;s entire hand was drenched with Rika&#39;s fluids as she returned the
favor, first playing with her lips by rubbing them lightly before
slipping past them and sending her fingers down into Nei&#39;s crevice. The
two girls continued fingering each other, their moans expressing
nothing but pleasure and even a sort of bond between each other. The
lonliness that had occupied their souls in their short lives finally
seemed to be going away, or at the very least, it was pushed away for
the time being. The two girls&#39; juices mingled as they came together.
Their panting steadily grew slower as they held each other on the bed,
now covered with a blanket making the otherwise cold room oddly warm..
a sensation not very common in the cold sensation in the simulations.

&quot;Will I see you again?&quot; Nei asked Rika, caressing her cheek.

&quot;I&#39;m sure I will, it was nice to meet you, Nei.&quot; Rika kissed Nei again,
not wanting to let go of her...

A calm, controlled, very soft and natural yet unmistakeably mechanical
voice rang through the &#39;room&#39;, &quot;Rika, I sense a lifeform coming, it is
a Parman. Stocky build, approximately 50 years old. He is currently
being persued by a bio-monster. I suggest you take immediate action.&quot;

&quot;Nei, I have to go.&quot; Rika squeezed Nei&#39;s hand sadly.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I understand. Hopefully I&#39;ll see you again.&quot; Nei returned
the squeeze, sighing sadly as Rika pulled out of the database.

* * *

Rika appeared once again in the tube in which she slept. Her clothes
were still on, however, she did sense herself as being moist in her
lower regions. The wires pulled off of her hair and retreated their
normal compartment. She rushed off as quickly as she could, preparing
herself for a fight.

It didn&#39;t take long before she found a man fitting Seed&#39;s description
who was cornered by a truly bizarre beast that was like a tripod
spliced with an insect and some moss as interpreted by Dali. Rika
successfully dodged it&#39;s fierce attacks and made short work of it by
two quick slashes to it&#39;s head.

After having thanked Rika countless times, the man introduced himself
as Proffessor Holt, a researcher from Motavia Academy. He seemed kind
enough, if not a little eccentric. Rika tried to do the best she could
to accomodate him in these circumstances. She would say she was
successful enough...

* * *

A few days later, more people arrived, it was a small group of four.
They were a Motavian wielding a rather mean-looking battle axe, a woman
with long brown hair dressed in a Hunter&#39;s uniform looking rather
annoyed at Holt, a rather young man who was dressed in traditional
Motavia Academy robes, and finally..a boy with blonde hair, also
sporting a red Hunter&#39;s uniform. Rika wasn&#39;t quite sure what to make of
all of this...
