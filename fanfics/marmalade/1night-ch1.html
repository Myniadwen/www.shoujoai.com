<h1>One Night</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../marmalade/index.html">Marmalade Boy</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meikosama.html">Azfixiation</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This was an idea I came up with the other night. I&#39;m a huge fan of
Marmalade Boy and I adore Meiko. I&#39;ve always thought her and Miki would
be cute together, but it&#39;s very clear that they each have someone else
and wouldn&#39;t think that way..At least not until I get a hold of them.
^-^ And for the standard disclaimer..I don&#39;t own them, don&#39;t sue me.
&gt;.&lt; Oh, and there are spoilers in this so if you haven&#39;t seen all of it
and don&#39;t want to know what goes on towards the end of the series, I
recommend you don&#39;t read this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meiko was looking through old photo albums at pictures of her loved
Na-chan one night after the two made up. She was so thankful that Miki
helped get them back together and knew she owed her friend so much.
Finally she had her life back, but just as her world fell into place,
Miki&#39;s shattered.

Yuu had finally left for America and Miki was very depressed without
him. She did her best to hide it, but Meiko could see through her. She
knew best after all, it was the same thing she did when Na-chan left
her. As she came across a picture of her and her best friend she
stopped to admire her friends cute face. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Miki, I&#39;m still
here for you.&quot; Meiko said absently to the picture as if Miki could
actually hear. She closed the photo album and turned off her lights
getting ready to climb into bed when she heard a faint knock on the
door.

&quot;Meiko-san are you still awake?&quot; A soft voice called through the door.
Meiko recognized it as the so called &#39;maids&#39; voice that her parents had
hired to keep the house standing while they were busy cheating on each
other.

&quot;I&#39;m awake,&quot; Meiko called out wondering why she was being interrupted
so late at night.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to bother you but Koishikawa-san is downstairs and she seems
really upset and..&quot; the maid didn&#39;t get to finish as Meiko hopped out
of her bed and ran past her. As Meiko looked down the long staircase
she saw Miki looking at her trying to hold back her sobs.

&quot;Miki,&quot; Meiko softly said her friends name as she reached the bottom of
the stairs. It really broke her heart to see the usually cheerful Miki
in such a state. Meiko didn&#39;t even have to ask what was wrong, she knew
exactly what it was and instead of talking she wrapped her arms around
Miki.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for coming over so late. I just couldn&#39;t sleep and I have no
one else now. Your the only one that I can come to.&quot; Miki started
crying again as she held onto Meiko.

&quot;Let&#39;s go upstairs ne? We can talk up there.&quot; Meiko said as she led
Miki up to her bedroom. Once inside Miki sat on Meiko&#39;s bed with her
head in her hands crying.

&quot;I miss him too much. I can&#39;t go on like this.&quot; Miki stopped crying to
look up at her friend who was now sitting next to her. Meiko put her
arm around Miki&#39;s shoulders and tried to think of something to do to
comfort her friend.

&quot;I know what your going through, and I know how hard it is. But thanks
to you I can finally be happy again so I promise I&#39;ll do all I can to
make you happy as well.&quot;

For the first time in days Miki actually smiled for real. She knew
coming to Meiko&#39;s was the right thing to do. &quot;Arigatou Meiko. Your the
best friend I could ask for.&quot;

&quot;And the same goes for you Miki. Now why don&#39;t we lay down and try to
get some sleep?&quot; Meiko got up and found something in her room for Miki
to sleep in. Miki&#39;s eyes trailed to Meiko&#39;s nightstand where there were
several framed pictures. The biggest being on of her and Na-chan.
Another of the two of them, and finally one of the whole
group..including Yuu.

Miki felt ridiculous wanting to cry over such a small thing as a
picture but she couldn&#39;t help it. She remembered that day so fondly.
When the group went skiing and Yuu came and saved her. Tears started to
flow from Miki&#39;s eyes before she could stop herself.

&quot;Here sleep in this,&quot; Meiko said as she turned around and saw Miki
crying once again.

&quot;Every little thing makes me think of him. It&#39;s pathetic.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s not pathetic. It just shows how much you love him. Now go on
and change and we&#39;ll try to get some sleep.&quot; Meiko turned around to
find another pillow for Miki to use while she got dressed. Finally a
few minutes passed and the two girls were laying quietly in bed.

&quot;Why do I cry so much Meiko? It won&#39;t do any good.&quot; Miki asked as she
got her eyes to focus on her friend in the darkened room.

&quot;Well what do you think will do you some good?&quot; Meiko knew whatever
Miki&#39;s answer would be she&#39;d go for it if Miki thought it would help.

&quot;I want to be held. I miss being in his arms so much and, well I just
miss the physical contact.&quot; Miki laughed at herself thinking she must
sound silly.

&quot;Well I know I&#39;m not as big as him but you can pretend right?&quot; With
that said Meiko wrapped her arms around Miki and held her close. Trying
to lighten the mood Meiko made her voice as deep as she could, trying
to imitate Yuu and simply said, &quot;I love you Miki.&quot;

They both started laughing at that and Miki advised Meiko that it&#39;s a
good thing she&#39;s a girl because if any guy ever had that silly of a
voice he&#39;d never get a date.

&quot;You know I&#39;m sexy,&quot; Meiko teased back at Miki using her &#39;deep&#39; voice
again.

&quot;You wish,&quot; Miki said as she propped herself up on one elbow to look
down at Meiko. She felt happy for the first time since Yuu left her and
she owed it all to Meiko.

&quot;Maybe I do,&quot; Meiko said almost inaudibly after a few seconds had
passed.

&quot;Meiko?&quot; Miki wondered if Meiko really meant that.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know where that came from.&quot; Meiko felt as if she
couldn&#39;t breathe. She really had no clue why she said that but when she
felt Miki&#39;s lips pressed to hers she didn&#39;t question a thing. She
wrapped her arms around Miki and pulled her body down on top of hers.
Both girls were very lonely from being so far away from their lovers
and the physical contact definitely felt good to both of them.

Finally they broke apart and once again Meiko told Miki that she loved
her, only this time she was serious. &quot;I love you too Meiko. I&#39;m glad I
have such a good friend that I can turn too. I miss Yuu a lot but with
you around it won&#39;t seem so bad.&quot;

They knew from now on their relationship would be different but in a
good way. It&#39;s not everyday two best friends discover such a thing but
they both found they were attracted to the other. Yes, they still loved
their boyfriends very much but they also loved each other in a way more
than friendship.

&quot;Thank you for giving me a reason to not miss Yuu so much,&quot; Miki told
Meiko as she laid back down in her arms. She thought for a moment she
should feel awkward about this but then quickly dismissed the thought.
Her and Meiko now had an even stronger tie to one another. One that no
one else, not even their lovers could take away from them. And she knew
she could never ask for more than that..
