<h1>More Than a Fan...</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tokyomewmew/index.html">Tokyo Mew Mew</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hentou.html">Hentou</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Note: If you don&#39;t like this pairing, then don&#39;t read this fanfic, 
unless you&#39;re curious. If you read it, please send me feedback, it&#39;d be 
much appriciated if you would tell me how to improve it, too (remember, 
I haven&#39;t seen all of the anime episodes, just the mangas). I think I 
made Minto too much of a drama-queen and Zakuro too naive. Oh well, I 
hope you like it! MintoxZakuro! 

--------

I quickly told my maids to pack my bags. Everyone seemed happy that this 
day had come, especialy me. I was so excited, giggling every once in a 
while because of a little event that happened the previous day... 

&quot;I&#39;m so bored!&quot; I, Minto Aizawa, said. I used to be a half-bird super 
hero and part-time cafe waitress. Being a hero was fun, but that was 
over now, and, even though I did nothing but sip on a cup of tea the 
whole time, I missed working at Cafe Mew Mew. It wasn&#39;t the pretty wings 
I missed or my cute outfit or even my fame. For once in my life, I 
wanted something that couldn&#39;t be bought. Nothing that could be handed 
to me so easily, nothing that could be obtained without moving a muscle, 
and it was nothing that I&#39;d think was simple. The reason I missed those 
things were all to see one person everyday. I missed that person so 
much, I would cry until I couldn&#39;t cry anymore. 

&quot;Why did you have to go...?&quot; I asked sadly, not expecting an answer, but 
someone replied, &quot;go where?&quot; I was shocked! I remembered that voice, 
that tone, the heavenly sound of the person I&#39;d missed for so long. 
&quot;O-onee-sama? Zakuro onee-sama!&quot; I shouted as I ran towards Zakuro 
Fujiwara, and huged her so tightly. I was crying and sniffling, even 
though I tried my hardest to hold my tears back. &quot;Minto?&quot; said Zakuro 
onee-sama, then I said, &quot;yes?&quot; &quot;I... I want to know if you want to go to 
America with me tommarow. I know it&#39;s on short notice, but I&#39;m modeling 
and I&#39;d realy like for you to come.&quot; I couldn&#39;t believe it! My heart 
leaped with joy! I cried harder, then said, &quot;thank you so much, Zakuro 
onee-sama! I&#39;d love to come with you!&quot; 

Having one fourth of my wardrobe coming along with me on my week-long 
trip, I waited for Zakuro onee-sama&#39;s limo to drive by. Five minutes 
later, a long car stopped infront of my mansion. Eventualy, all of my 
bags fit into the trunk of the limo. I said good bye to everyone, hugged 
Miki, and went into the vehicle. 

Blushing at the thought of being with her, I was very excited about 
going to America with someone I&#39;d liked for a long time. &quot;Onee-sama~!&quot; I 
said outloud, thinking about being with her the whole time. &quot;Nani, 
Minto?&quot; Zakuro onee-sama replied. &quot;Um, just thinking, onee-sama! I&#39;m 
sorry...&quot; &quot;It&#39;s okay, Minto. What&#39;re you thinking about?&quot; 

I blushed, then said, &quot;nothing, realy.&quot; Zakuro said, &quot;alright, then,&quot; 
and looked out of the window. I became a bit sad, as I thought, I can&#39;t 
tell her... she wouldn&#39;t realy care if I did. I realy want to tell you, 
but I can&#39;t... I love you, Zakuro onee-sama! Oh, is this how Ichigo 
feels everytime she&#39;s around Aoyama-kun? I blushed a little more as I 
looked at Zakuro onee-sama&#39;s saphire eyes in the reflection of her 
window. I guess she noticed me staring at her, because she turned around 
to look at me, but I emediatly ripped my eyes away from her. 

It was realy quiet. To break the silence, I asked, &quot;um, Zakuro 
onee-sama? When are we getting to the airport?&quot; Zakuro onee-sama didn&#39;t 
say anything. &quot;O-onee-sama, I asked--&quot; &quot;--oh, I&#39;m sorry Minto, I was 
thinking... we&#39;ll get there in a half-hour,&quot; Zakuro onee-sama told me, 
looking at her watch. 

I wanted to ask what she was thinking about. I wanted her to answer 
&#39;you, of course!&#39; I wanted to say the samething to her, but no. I didn&#39;t 
say a thing. 

The limo came to a sharp curve to the right. I was on the right side of 
the limo, causing me to suddenly lean to the left, falling onto Zakuro 
onee-sama. I quickly pushed myself away from her, look out of my widow, 
and blushed. That was so embarassing! &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, Zakuro onee-sama! I 
swear, I didn&#39;t mean to!&quot; I said, but for some reason, I started to cry 
a little. No!, I thought, Don&#39;t cry, Minto! It&#39;s okay now! It was a 
total accident! Don&#39;t cry! 

I tried wipe my tears from my eyes before Zakuro onee-sama suspected 
something, but she asked, &quot;are you alright, Minto? You&#39;re acting a 
little strange right now, are you sure you want to go with me?&quot; 

I rubbed my eyes before turning to Zakuro onee-sama. &quot;Yes, Zakuro 
onee-sama. I want to come with you. I&#39;d go anywhere as long as you&#39;re 
there. I missed you so much... I&#39;m sorry for crying now.&quot; I couldn&#39;t 
beleive I said that, but I kinda didn&#39;t care. No one else was listening, 
since the driver has a glass window behind him. Just me and Zakuro 
onee-sama... alone for the ride. &quot;What are you realy telling me, Minto?&quot; 
&quot;I&#39;m saying... I, um, wanted to be with you,&quot; I blushed as I said that. 
&quot;I missed you, too, Minto. I&#39;m glad we&#39;re going together.&quot; &quot;Realy, 
Zakuro onee-sama?,&quot; I said, &quot;you realy mean it?&quot; She nodded, then I 
smiled and thought happy thoughts until we got to the airport.  

When we got there, we went to our airplane. Five more minutes before we 
were going in the sky. I was nervous, I&#39;ve never been in an airplane 
before! What if we crash? I thought to myself, what if we fly too high? 
What if there&#39;s a bomb on the plane? What if-- &quot;Minto, you&#39;ve never been 
on a plane before, have you?&quot; &quot;Yes, um, no, uh, I haven&#39;t been on one. 
Zakuro onee-sama, are you sure it&#39;s safe?&quot; I asked nervously. &quot;It&#39;s 
alright. It&#39;s very rare that a plane would crash. Come on, Minto,&quot; 
Zakuro onee-sama lead me towards the airplane. Of course, with her body 
guard people not too far away from us. 

We got to our seats in first-class. I was still worried, but as long as 
I was with Zakuro onee-sama, I felt safe. I hugged her arm for comfort, 
hoping she wouldn&#39;t mind. I felt relaxed, as if I could fall asleep 
right there and then, but I didn&#39;t want to miss looking at Zakuro 
onee-sama&#39;s face. I looked up at her, she was smiling at me, then put 
the arm I wasn&#39;t hugging around me. My heart was pounding so hard and 
fast, I was blushing, and I said to her &quot;Zakuro onee-sama...?&quot; &quot;Yes, 
Minto?&quot; &quot;I... I-I, um, nevermind.&quot; I sighed. I was too content to be 
saying anything. I was still blushing, then I hugged her arm tighter. 

&quot;Hey, Minto. May I ask you something?&quot; Zakuro onee-sama asked me. 
&quot;Sure.&quot; &quot;May I call you Minto-chan?&quot; My heart was beating faster than 
the other time! &quot;I-if I may call you Zakuro,&quot; it sounded weird, but if 
she wants to, she may call me Minto-chan. &quot;Alright, Minto-chan.&quot; My face 
was beet red! I thought I was going to have a heart-attack! She, the 
famous model Zakuro Fujiwara, was calling me Minto-chan! I smiled and 
giggled a little, totaly aware that Zakuro onee-sama, who I call Zakuro 
now, was listening to me. I was hugging her, not just her arm, but all 
across her. 

Zakuro, still hugging me, rested her cheek on top of my head. I was so 
happy, I felt a tear from my eye falling onto the seat I was sitting on. 
It made a small noise as it hit the seat, but then the plane was 
vibrating. &quot;Zakuro, are we going now?&quot; I asked her. &quot;Yes, Minto-chan, 
it&#39;s time.&quot; I guess someone was watching us, because when I felt 
something warm on the back of my neck, I turned around. There were guys 
every where! Eeeeewwww! Panting and drooling! &quot;Zakuro,&quot; I whispered to 
her, &quot;how long are they gonna stand here?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll give an autograph to 
the first person who leaves me alone!&quot; she yelled to everyone, asuring 
me they&#39;d fall for it. Emediatly, they went to their seats at the same 
time. &quot;Looks like you have a lot to sign, huh, Zakuro?&quot; I felt her cheek 
rubbing up and down on my head. 

As the plane was moving, I became worried again. I hugged Zakuro 
tighter, closed my eyes, and tried to think of happy things. She hugged 
my tighter, too. After about a minute, the plane left the ground. Zakuro 
took her head off of mine, then patted my hair. She felt the parts of my 
hair that were rolled-up like yarn balls. &quot;We&#39;ll be there in two hours, 
Minto-chan,&quot; she told me, then she looked out of her window. &quot;Oh, I 
almost forgot, I bought you something,&quot; she pulled a little box out of 
her pocket and handed it to me, &quot;it&#39;s not much, but I did think of you.&quot; 

I pulled the purple ribbons off, then opened it. Inside was a necklace 
chain with a beautiful aqua-blue stone in the middle. &quot;Do you like it, 
Minto-chan?&quot; &quot;Yes, Zakuro, thank you so much! It&#39;s beautiful!&quot; I said to 
her, but the stone still wasn&#39;t nearly as beautiful as Zakuro&#39;s eyes. 
&quot;It&#39;s an opal. You were born in October, right? If you were, this is 
your birthstone,&quot; she told me, &quot;it&#39;s coming this week, right?&quot; I 
completly forgot about that! &quot;You remembered! Oh, thank you!&quot; She put it 
around my neck as I hugged her. She also took the two ribbons, then tied 
them in my hair. &quot;That&#39;s better!&quot; Zakuro said in satisfaction, then 
hugged me again. 

A few, almost silent, minutes later, Zakuro said to me, &quot;Minto-chan?&quot; 
&quot;Yes, Zakuro?&quot; I replied. &quot;May I ask you something, again?&quot; &quot;Sure!&quot; She 
whispered in my ear, &quot;has anyone ever told you &#39;I love you&#39;, outside of 
your family?&quot; 

This question caught me completly off guard! Yet, I didn&#39;t hesitate to 
answer, &quot;no, Zakuro. Why do you ask?&quot; She continued, &quot;have you ever said 
&#39;I love you&#39; to anyone outside of your family?&quot; I answered, &quot;no, 
Zakuro.&quot; I was nervous. What if she tells me? I thought. &quot;Is there 
anyone you&#39;d like to say that to?&quot; she asked me. &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Who is it? A 
boy at school?&quot; she asked, then I answered, quietly, &quot;no.&quot; &quot;Who is it, 
then?&quot; she responded. &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot; I asked back. 

&quot;I was just curious and it was quiet,&quot; she said to me, &quot;I hope I--&quot; 
&quot;--you,&quot; I said quickly and quietly. She let go of me, then said, &quot;I 
couldn&#39;t here you Minto-chan. What&#39;d you say?&quot; I blushed, I totaly 
didn&#39;t mean to say it, but since she already heard, &quot;I said you, 
Zakuro.&quot; I guess she was surprised at my answer, but, on the other hand, 
it wasn&#39;t much of a surprise. Looking back at everything, she probably 
got the hint a while ago. 

&quot;Listen, Minto-chan, a lot of fans say that,&quot; she told me. &quot;But, Zakuro! 
I love you! I really love you! So much, I&#39;ve been crying for the past 
month because I haven&#39;t seen you for a while! And I&#39;ve been acting 
strange around you, because I was afraid you would reject me!&quot; I started 
to cry, &quot;please believe me, Zakuro! It&#39;s true! I&#39;ve even written twenty 
pages of notebook paper that says so!&quot; I tried to hug her, but she 
pushed me away, gentily. 

&quot;Minto... you didn&#39;t have to say that in public.&quot; I looked around. 
Everyone was looking at us. I embarassed myself! I thought, this&#39;ll be 
in the newspaper tommarow! Or on the news! Everyone&#39;d make fun of me, or 
ignore me! But... what about Zakuro? Everyone&#39;d hate her, too! I cried 
and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Zakuro! I&#39;m so sorry! I--&quot; &quot;--look at me, 
Minto-chan,&quot; Zakuro said. &quot;When we get off of this airplane, we&#39;ll talk 
more about that. Right now, let&#39;s enjoy the ride.&quot; She put her head on 
mine, again, as I calmed down. </pre>
