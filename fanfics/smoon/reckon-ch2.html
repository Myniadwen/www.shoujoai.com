<h1>Thoughts of Home: The Reckoning (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sailordoc.html">Sailor Doc</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/reckon-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The evening had started out innocently enough.  Makoto, who had been 
struggling with some new equations they&#39;d been given, had begged Ami 
for some extra help with them.  Where everyone else at their usual 
afternoon study session, including Usagi, had seemed to finally catch 
on, she just couldn&#39;t seem to grasp them.  Since Ami&#39;s Mom had to work 
that night she had suggested that Makoto just come home with her.  
They&#39;d get comfortable, order some delivery and tackle the 
mathematical youma attacking Mako&#39;s head.

&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Makoto had agreed.  She was really worried about 
this lesson, math being a subject she hated and really had to work 
hard at. Gathering up their books, they had bid everyone goodnight and 
hand in hand, headed out the door.

Upon arrival at the Mizuno&#39;s house, Makoto had taken their books and 
headed for the living room while Ami had entered her Mother&#39;s study to 
call in an order for delivery.

&quot;Oh my god!  What IS that thing?&quot;  she heard Makoto exclaim from the 
other room.

&quot;What?&quot; Ami asked, walking into the living room, portable phone in 
hand.

&quot;THAT!&quot;  Makoto said, her eyes fixed on the offending object.  &quot;It&#39;s 
hideous!&quot;

&quot;Oh, that,&quot; Ami said, giggling.  &quot;That&#39;s Mom&#39;s new &#39;buried treasure&#39; 
she found last week when she went antique hunting.  It&#39;s a 17th 
century armoire she found hidden in the back of an old antique shop 
downtown.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it sure looks like it was &#39;buried&#39; all right,&quot;  Makoto quipped, 
looking at how filthy her hand was from just reaching out to touch one 
of the badly stained double doors on the front of the piece.  &quot;I can 
see why it was hidden in the back.&quot;

&quot;Makoto!  Stop,&quot;  Ami laughed.  &quot;It&#39;s really not that bad.  By the 
time Mom has it restored you won&#39;t be able to recognize it!&quot;

Makoto had looked skeptical.

&quot;Really!&quot;  Ami insisted.  &quot;She seems to have a real eye for this kind 
of thing,&quot; she continued, her eyes clearly showing the deep affection 
she had for her Mother.  &quot;She really enjoys it too, and it gives her a 
chance to get away from medical stuff every once in a while.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot;  Makoto relented.  &quot;If you say so,&quot; she said, reaching forward 
to pull the smaller girl gently into her arms.  Her heart thrilled as 
she felt Ami snuggle into her embrace.

&quot;I say so,&quot; Ami replied, her head resting lightly against Makoto&#39;s 
chest, a smile coming unbidden to her lips as she listened to Mako&#39;s 
steady heartbeat.

After a few moments of comfortable silence Makoto had said, &quot;you 
really love your Mom a lot, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ami answered from the warm comfort of her lover&#39;s arms.  &quot;She 
really had it rough for a while after my Father all but left.  Somehow 
though, she seemed to pull it all together and we made out all right.&quot;

Makoto rocked her gently as Ami continued.  &quot;I worry about her 
sometimes though.  She pushes herself a little too hard sometimes.  
Like today.&quot;

&quot;What about today?&quot;  Makoto asked.

Ami sighed.  &quot;Well, she has a twelve hour shift in the ER today and 
she&#39;s really not well.&quot;  Frowning, she said, &quot;I tried to convince her 
to stay home, but she just insisted she&#39;d be fine.&quot;

&quot;Well, you just have to trust her then,&quot;  Makoto said.  &quot;I&#39;m sure if 
it gets to the point she can&#39;t do her job, she&#39;ll come home.  She 
wouldn&#39;t do anything to endanger her patients would she?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Well, then?&quot;

Hugging Makoto closer to her, she sighed.  &quot;Yeah,  you&#39;re right, of 
course.  If her temperature starts to go back up she&#39;ll come home.&quot;

&quot;Feel better now?&quot;  Makoto asked.

&quot;I think so,&quot;  Ami said, smiling at Makoto.

With a slight squeeze, Makoto said, &quot;We&#39;d better get to work or I&#39;ll 
never get done.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you will,&quot;  Ami promised.  &quot;You&#39;ll see!  Come on.&quot;

Taking Makoto by the hand, she led her to the small table in the 
center of the room where the hated math assignment waited.

Two hours, one pizza, and a two liter sprite later, the light had gone 
on, and Makoto had grinned in delight as the hateful formula had 
finally made sense.  Ami had been amused to see the ferocity with 
which her girlfriend had attacked the related problems in her 
assignment, her pencil fairly flying across the paper in front of her 
as she knocked out one after another.  Soon though, Ami begin to find 
her attention wandering elsewhere...

The curve of Makoto&#39;s neck as she leaned over her work...

The play of the firm muscles just under the smooth, lightly tanned 
skin of her arm as she worked the yellow pencil in her hand...

The adorable way her tongue just seemed to be peeking from between her 
lips on one side...

The way that sleeveless, mock turtleneck seemed to just cling to her 
in all the right places...

&quot;Are you okay Mako-chan?&quot;  Ami asked suddenly, a bit surprised at just 
how breathless she sounded.  &quot;I mean, does it feel a bit warm in here 
to you?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot;  Makoto had answered without ever looking up from her 
work.  There was about her the air of someone with a grim 
determination to finish a hated and unwanted task.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Ami said, a bit disappointed.  &quot;It must be just me then.&quot;

&quot;Uh,&quot;  Makoto had grunted in acknowledgment.

&quot;Do you mind if I step out for a few minutes?&quot;  Ami inquired.

&quot;No, no.  That&#39;s fine sweetheart,&quot;  Makoto said, eyes still fixed on 
her work, never seeing the blush that covered Ami&#39;s face at her 
endearment. &quot;Do whatever you have to do.  I&#39;ll be all right here.&quot;

&quot;Okay, love&quot;  Ami responded, her blush deepening.  &quot;I&#39;ll be right 
back.&quot;

Makoto lost all track of time as she worked through her final homework 
assignment.  She was totally unaware of Ami&#39;s return a short time 
later until she heard her voice from behind her.

&quot;How&#39;s it coming?&quot;  Ami asked.

&quot;Great!&quot;  Makoto answered.  &quot;I&#39;m almost finished!&quot;  she said, head 
still bent over her work.  Ami giggled softly.  She had the distinct 
impression of a race horse headed down the home stretch.

&quot;So,&quot;  Ami inquired.  &quot;How much longer?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m on the last one now,&quot;  Makoto said.  &quot;Say, you know this wasn&#39;t 
so bad once I got the hang of it.&quot;

&quot;I never doubted you for a minute, love.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Ami!&quot;  Makoto said with a warm smile as she finished the last 
problem.  &quot;I never would have gotten this without your help.  Say, 
would you mind looking over these for me?  Just to make double sure I 
didn&#39;t screw them up somewhere?&quot;

&quot;Maybe later,&quot;  Ami said, her lips next to Makoto&#39;s ear as her arms 
encircled her shoulders from behind her place on the couch.  &quot;I have 
something else I&#39;d prefer to &#39;look over&#39; right now.&quot;

Pleasantly surprised, Makoto turned to meet Ami.  &quot;Is that so?&quot;  she 
asked.

&quot;Oh yes, most definitely!&quot;  she whispered as she leaned further over 
the couch to meet Makoto&#39;s eager lips.

All thoughts of time or math fled before the wave of feelings ignited 
by their kiss.  Turning slightly in the circle of Ami&#39;s arms, Makoto 
placed a hand gently against the back of her Ami&#39;s head to steady her 
as they deepened their kiss.  With great care, Makoto pulled the 
smaller girl over the back of the couch and into her arms, vividly 
aware of the wash of her emotions in the rapid beating of her heart.

&quot;I love you, Ami,&quot;  she said into Ami&#39;s thick, blue hair as she held 
her close to her heart.

&quot;Oh Makoto,&quot;  Ami replied, her voice barely discernible as she 
caressed Makoto&#39;s cheek.  &quot;I love you too, so very much!&quot;  With a 
renewed hunger, the young lovers resumed their kisses, both starting 
to feel the rise of a passion that was still so new to them.

Holding Ami in her arms, Makoto started to realize that Ami had 
slipped into something more comfortable...and very familiar when she&#39;d 
left the room.

Delivering a line of soft kisses down the side of the delicate neck 
before her, Makoto said, &quot;m-m-m, that shirt looks kind of familiar.&quot;

&quot;Does it?&quot;  Ami asked, her eyes closed as her head rolled slightly to 
the side to provide Mako with easier access.

&quot;Seeing as it&#39;s mine, yeah,&quot;  Makoto answered, working her way across 
Ami&#39;s collarbone with teasing nibbles.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s mine now,&quot; Ami said, running her fingers through Makoto&#39;s 
hair, freeing it from it&#39;s customary pony tail.

&quot;What if I want it back?&quot;  Makoto asked as her hands slid under the 
shirt in question and moved softly, but firmly up either side of Ami&#39;s 
spine.

&quot;Then you&#39;ll just have to take it,&quot;  Ami whispered, looking into 
Makoto&#39;s eyes, the fire in hers plainly seen.

&quot;Ami-love,&quot;  Makoto whispered back as she lowered the shirt over Ami&#39;s 
shoulders and kissed her deeply and passionately, a kiss Ami returned 
with vigor.

&quot;Ami?&quot;

The voice came out of nowhere and was accompanied by the slamming of 
the front door, and a violent sneeze.

&quot;Ami?  Are you home?&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot;  Ami said, her eyes as big as saucers as she looked at her 
lover in desperation.

&quot;God!&quot;  Makoto finished, the icy, cold finger of fear slipping down 
her spine.

**********************************************************************

&quot;Oh.  My.  God!&quot;  was all Minako could say, horror written across her 
face as she stared at the young couple seated across from her on the 
love seat.

Rei was aghast.  &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding!  I&#39;m mean, she actually 
walked in on you two?!?&quot;

&quot;Well no, not exactly,&quot;  Ami said.  &quot;It wasn&#39;t quite that simple.&quot;

&quot;Is it ever?&quot;  Haruka asked with a wide grin.

&quot;No!&quot;  Makoto moaned, from behind the shield of her hands, still 
refusing to looked at the others.

&quot;Steady, love,&quot;  Ami soothed, rubbing Makoto&#39;s back in comfort. 
Smiling at the rest of the group she said.  &quot;She&#39;s right though.  I 
guess these things can never really be simple.&quot;

&quot;So what happened next?&quot;  Usagi asked, leaning forward in anticipation 
of a juicy tale.

&quot;Oh, never fear,&quot;  Ami assured her.  &quot;It gets better...&quot;

&quot;Better?&quot;  Makoto asked, giving an incredulous look to her partner, 
one eyebrow raised in question.

&quot;Hush love!  I&#39;m telling this one.&quot;  Ami said with a wink and a smile 
at her uncomfortable lover.
