<h1>Mistaken Assumption (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/misass-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Ami sat at her desk studying, occasionally checking her buddylist 
incase the  alert she put on it wasn&#39;t working.  Every time she looked 
at it she got  more pissed.  It had been more than a month since she 
last saw Nat, at first  so many scenarios ran through her mind.  She 
thought that Nat went on a trip  for a little while and couldn&#39;t reach 
her.   After two weeks of thinking  that she worried that something 
horrible had happened to Nat and no one knew  of her to tell her. 

As of the last few days doubt and betrayal had broken into her cloud of  
worry.  The unanswered emails, and never seeing Nat online anymore was  
getting to her.  It wasn&#39;t long after Nat disappeared that Ami came up 
with  another solution, but that one was too horrible to be true, so 
she tucked it  away and never thought of it.  Nonetheless it was 
looming around in her mind  as a quiet voice and the longer Nat stayed 
away, the louder and more  insistant it became.  

Ami returned to her work, it startled her some minutes later when she 
saw  little droplets of water on her books.  It surprised her even more 
when she  found a stream of it on her cheeks.  Just then the full force 
of it hit her,  the complete betrayal of trust, the lies, the hurting, 
the deception.  &quot;What  else could it be?&quot; she cried into hands.  Her 
mind answered her question  &#145;nothing, Nat has been playing tricks on 
you for months, playing with your  feelings, pretending to fall in love 
with you.&#39;  Ami gave a short laugh full  of self loathing as another 
thought crossed her mind, &#145;Nat probably wasn&#39;t  even a woman.&#39;  Her 
sobs increased as she sat there and reprimanded herself  for even 
falling love with someone she met on the net, &#145;how could I be so  
stupid.&#39;  

Ami stood in front of Makoto&#39;s apartment door, double checking it with 
the  address she had in her hand.  The paper also contained a phone 
number, one  that Ami did use, but, hung up before she got an answer.  
She thought the  looooooooong drive from Kyoto to Tokyo would do her 
good.  She was tired,  but the drive would keep her mind off of Nat.  
Usagi&#39;s house was closer, but  she didn&#39;t want to trouble her friend.  
Usagi probably had her hands full  with Chibi Usa anyway.  Minako was 
back in England and Rei lived even  farther than Makoto.  

It was 6 am when she finally stood in front of Makoto&#39;s door, she 
didn&#39;t  know how she would be received considering she was unannounced 
and  uninvited, she didn&#39;t even know if makoto was home. She knocked 
anyway  because she had come this far, might as well go all the way.  
Besides the  need to talk to someone about her problem with Nat was too 
overwhelming to  ignore, &#145;talking about it was the first step in 
getting over it&#39; Ami&#39;s mind  reasoned.  

Makoto opened the door mid yawn, sleep still in her eyes.  Ami 
instantly  felt sorry when she saw the state of Makoto.  She was about 
to express it,  but was stopped by Makoto&#39;s words.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to 
apologize,&quot; she said  pulling Ami in and closing the door.  On Ami&#39;s 
questioning glance she  answered &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter how long we haven&#39;t 
seen each other Ami, it&#39;s  still obvious when you want to apologize.&quot;  

Ami only turned away, she didn&#39;t know how to answer, was it good or bad 
that  she was so readable. 

She didn&#39;t find the answer in the short time it took Makoto to speak 
again,  &quot;this is a pleasant surprise.&quot;  

After hugging each other, Makoto invited her to sit on the sofa.  The 
look  of concern Ami saw on Makoto&#39;s face told her that the taller 
woman had  noticed her red puffy eyes, and blotchy face.  She was 
pleasantly stunned  when she felt Makoto&#39;s hand on her cheek, &quot;you 
wanna tell me about it?&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s why I came here,&quot; Ami answered behind a self-conscious laugh. 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m willing to listen,&quot; she said gently stroking Ami&#39;s cheek 
with her  thumb.  

It was painful, but Ami started at the beginning without going into 
great  detail.  She told Makoto of meeting this woman in a chatroom, 
falling in  love with her, then of her disappearance over a month ago.  
Ami neared the  end her story with her scenarios and doubts, making it 
plain which she  believed to be true.  By the end she was in Makoto&#39;s 
arms feeling grateful  for her support, and verbally beating herself up 
again for falling in love  in the first place. 

With her head on Makoto&#39;s wet shoulder she wondered out loud &quot;how could 
Nat  do this to me?&quot;     

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto thanked all who needed to be thanked for Ami not noticing how 
she  froze.  It was a natural reaction to what Ami just whispered &quot;&#145;how 
could Nat  do this to me?&#39;&quot;  Taking a quick breath she relaxed and went 
back to holding  Ami&#39;s shuddering body.  The gears in her head started 
cranking as everything  began to piece itself together, like a puzzle 
Makoto didn&#39;t even realize she  had. 

Azure is from Kyoto, so&#39;s Ami.  Azure is in med school, so&#39;s Ami.  The  
genius she suspected Azure to be, Ami was.  Meeting in the chatroom, 
not  seeing the other woman for over a month, Makoto knew without 
thinking that  she blocked Azure more than a month ago.  How could she 
forget?  The most  overwhelming piece of the puzzle was Ami herself; 
her words: &quot;how could Nat  do this to me?&quot; 

&#145;Damnit, I&#39;m Nat,&#39; Makoto&#39;s mind screamed. &#145;And Ami&#39;s Azure.&#39;  As 
compelling  as the evidence are Makoto still had to be sure, &quot;what was 
the last thing  the two of you talked about?&quot;  

Ami sniffed a little and answered without looking up, &quot;just everyday 
stuff.&quot;    With another sniff she added &quot;she also wanted us to meet?&quot;  

That sealed any doubt in Makoto&#39;s mind as she sat gently stroking Ami&#39;s  
back. 

&quot;I realize it was probably a joke, but I can&#39;t help it.  That doesn&#39;t 
make  it hurt any less, my feelings for her aren&#39;t.  They&#39;re plenty 
real.&quot; Ami  said drying her eyes, she still wanted to cry but it felt 
as though she  didn&#39;t have anymore to spill.  She was too tired even 
open her eyes. All she  did was listen as she heard Makoto say, &quot;maybe 
Nat does love you Ami, and  she just...&quot; Makoto trailed off as she saw 
Ami&#39;s chest gently rise and fall,  realizing the shorter woman was 
asleep.  

She picked up the soft bundle in her arms and placed Ami in her bed.  
&quot;Maybe  she&#39;s just a fool&quot; makoto whispered conclusively as she tucked 
Ami in and  thought of what an idiot she&#39;s been.   

Makoto clicked on the email that had been sitting in its own folder for 
over  a month.  If Ami was Azure, then how can she be this heartbroken 
over  someone she feared.  Makoto had a sinking feeling that she just 
spent a  month hurting both herself and a woman who didn&#39;t deserve it.  
&#145;Neither of  us deserve this.&#39;  

Dear Nat,  

You left before I could explain to you what I&#39;m afraid of.  Believe me,  
every fiber of my being wants to be next to you.  I know how you feel, 
a pic  would be paltry compared to having the real thing.  I want to 
meet you, but  I can&#39;t help be afraid of what you&#39;d think of me when we 
do meet. I&#39;m not  saying that I&#39;m unattractive, but we all have our own 
tastes, don&#39;t we? What  if I&#39;m unappealing to you?  That terrifies me.  
I love you so much, it pains  me to think of you&#39;re rejection if you 
don&#39;t like my looks. 

I know we can&#39;t hide from each other behind a screen all our lives, 
that  would be too painful.  I&#39;ve had to put aside fears before, and 
this will be  one of them.  I want to see to you.  We&#39;ll talk more 
about it the next time  we see each other.  

Love, 
Azure  

Her throat got thicker and her heart was painfully heavy as she reread  
Azure/Ami&#39;s words.  Makoto was melancholy as she lamented not reading 
the  email the first time she saw it, maybe it could have prevented all 
the pain  she and the woman in her bed were suffering.  &#145;How could I 
have been so  stupid?&#39;  

Tired of feeling the agonize hurt her realization brought to her, 
Makoto  made her way to her bedroom with intentions of explaining 
things to Ami.   She was stopped however, as she thought that this was 
probably the first  time since yesterday morning that Ami was getting 
sleep.  She had driven all  night, after all.  

Staring at Ami, it hit Makoto for the first time: Azure IS Ami. She had  
realized it earlier, but they were still two different people up to 
now.   One, the woman she loves, the other, a beloved friend.  Now for 
the first  time the two merged in Makoto&#39;s mind and she placed a face 
to her love.   Ami.  She was in love with Ami.  Her heart swelled, and 
felt like there was  an intensly pure light threatening to burst it.  

Makoto smiled as she thought this was too good to be true.  She was in 
love  with Ami.  Her smile grew wider as she realized Ami loved her 
too.  This  realization took her back to a time when she used to steal 
glances at the  young girl Ami used to be.  And how she used to spend 
solitary nights  moaning Ami&#39;s name in ecstasy.  It took more than 
almost nine years but she  achieved Ami&#39;s love.  

However, the circumstances of their relationship brought her back to 
the  present.  &#145;She thinks I&#39;ve spent all these months playing with 
her.&#39;   

Climbing into bed next to her love she wondered &#145;how am I supposed to 
get  her to trust me again?&#39; 

She didn&#39;t sleep but spent the rest of the morning glancing over at the  
woman who held her heart, and thinking of ways to make it up to her.          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </pre>
