Aiaia walked into her Lady&#39;s suite and stopped abruptly when she saw who 
was there with the majestic beauty. It was that human female... Aiaia 
had never hated a human as much as she hated that girl. The brunette 
youma watched with disgust as the blonde slut snuggled up to her 
mistress on her throne of cushions, Lady Laodameia running her slender, 
delicate fingers through Sailor Venus&#39; hair affectionately. Aiaia could 
hardly stand it. It wasn&#39;t fair. Why did her Lady have to like humans so 
much and not give a second glance to a youma? And even if Lady Laodameia 
wasn&#146;t partial to youma, wasn&#39;t Aiaia&#39;s human appearance attractive? The 
youma was absolutely green with envy. She had decided that the next time 
she caught Sailor Venus alone, she was going to throw the girl out the 
window to a ten-storey fall. Aiaia could make up some excuse, like her 
mistress&#39;s mental domination had broken for an instant and rather than 
face a life of debauched servitude, Venus had chosen to kill herself 
instead. It wouldn&#146;t be the first time Aiaia had &#145;put down&#146; one of her 
mistress&#146;s pets in a fit of jealousy before. Thinking about the human 
girl&#146;s broken body on the streets below made the youma smile grimly, her 
mood brightening somewhat. Aiaia immediately came out of her private 
fantasy as Lady Laodameia turned her lovely eyes to the youma in silent 
question.

&quot;Tuxedo Kamen has been re-captured,&quot; Aiaia said somewhat breathlessly, 
getting flustered looking at her Lady&#146;s pale, exposed skin that was 
revealed by her rather daring gown.

Her mistress smirked, continuing to stroke Sailor Venus&#39; long hair as 
the girl cooed blissfully. &quot;Such a pity,&#148; Lady Laodameia said mockingly. 
&#147;He didn&#39;t know the limit of my power. The male thought when out of my 
sight he was out of my mind. I could read his thoughts even if I was on 
another plane of existence!&quot;

&quot;Yes, my Lady. There were many casualties however and some structural 
damage to this floor,&quot; Aiaia went on with her report.

Lady Laodameia waved her free hand in a dismissive gesture, her 
attention seeming almost wholly devoted to her new pet, Sailor Venus. 
&quot;The other humans in this building still believe there is no tenth 
floor. Besides, more youma fodder where they came from,&quot; she said 
absently, her last idle comment cutting Aiaia to the bone.

The brunette assistant lowered her head dejectedly to the plush carpet 
in front of her feet. Her mistress could be so cruel sometimes. &quot;Y-Yes, 
my Lady... what shall I do with Tuxedo Kamen?&quot; she asked in a subdued 
tone.

&quot;He is of no use to me... a broken toy. Kill him. Perhaps you could hang 
his body from Tokyo Bay&#39;s bridge...?&quot; Lady Laodameia replied, tickling 
her blonde plaything under the chin, causing the human to giggle.

Aiaia nodded eagerly. &quot;Yes, my Lady,&quot; she grinned enthusiastically, her 
mood vastly improving.

Lady Laodameia suddenly ceased fondling her prize and sat up straight, 
staring off into space. A seductive smile slowly began to spread across 
her pale, gorgeous features.

&quot;So... they found me... and with their minds all open...&quot; Lady Laodameia 
murmured to herself, ignoring Aiaia&#39;s and even Sailor Venus&#146; presence. 
&#147;Foolish...&#148;

The pink-clad woman&#39;s smile widened. &quot;Ahh... such determination, such 
dedication... odd how such strong feelings of love can be mixed with 
such undiluted hatred... I merely need to stoke the glowing embers of 
abhorrence and of purpose...&quot;

Lady Laodameia suddenly looked at Aiaia, directly in her eyes, causing a 
shiver of delight to run down the aide&#146;s spine. &quot;Tell my youma followers 
that we will be having guests... I want them led here,&quot; she ordered.

Aiaia simply nodded weakly, unable to pull her gaze away from her 
mistress&#39;s exquisite eyes. She then blinked, realisation dawning on her 
of what her Lady was actually demanding.

&quot;But, my Lady, you could be put in danger,&#148; Aiaia argued, the concern 
evident in her voice, &#147;wouldn&#39;t it be better if-&quot;

Lady Laodameia swiftly interrupted her. &quot;No. I want them led here. I 
want to keep some...&quot; she said, looking down at Sailor Venus. The girl 
gazed back up at her, unfettered adoration gleaming in her blue eyes.

&quot;It is a shame I never got the chance to break you in properly,&quot; Lady 
Laodameia whispered to Venus, while caressing one bare thigh, her hand 
disappearing under the human&#146;s short skirt, &quot;but it will be more fun 
this way. A loss will help to weaken your friends&#39; minds even more so.&quot;

The pink-haired woman leaned down and kissed Venus full on the lips, a 
kiss which the girl readily returned with equal passion, a few muted 
whimpers escaping her throat. Aiaia blushed furiously as she watched the 
heated kiss go on for several minutes, while grinding her teeth in 
jealously. The kiss finally ended, to the youma&#39;s relief, Lady Laodameia 
extracting her tongue from Sailor Venus&#39; ravished mouth.

&quot;You will wait for the other Sailor Senshi in the receiving room outside 
my door,&quot; Lady Laodameia instructed the blonde girl, in a tone as if she 
were addressing a small child. &quot;You will kill any senshi who tries to 
reach me until they are all dead or you are. Do you understand; they 
want to do me harm and we can&#39;t have that, can we?&quot;

Sailor Venus nodded with her lips slightly parted, straining her neck 
upwards, clearly wanting another kiss from her mistress.

&quot;Go now,&quot; Lady Laedameia chuckled, smiling at the cute pout that her pet 
gave her in response.

Sailor Venus faithfully followed Lady Laodameia&#39;s order, and let the 
definition of physical beauty out of her embrace, sliding off the large 
cushion pile and to the floor with an encouraging pat on the bottom from 
the woman. Venus walked out of the goddess&#146;s suite, swaying her hips 
suggestively all the while. She didn&#39;t notice the death glare Aiaia gave 
her. But at least the youma would be rid of the competition soon. Or 
until the other surviving Sailor Senshi were turned into slaves of 
course.

******

The three Sailor Senshi waited in a stairwell, having just transformed 
into their alter egos, and were ready to charge up to the tenth, and 
highest, level of the Rihga Royal Hotel. Artemis had pointed out the 
shattered window where Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s rose had flown out, and it was on 
the very top floor of the building. All the senshi and the two cats had 
agreed that the tenth floor of the luxury hotel was highly likely to be 
the location of the youma base, and where Minako and Mamoru were being 
held.

The plan was that two Sailor Senshi would take the elevator up to the 
top floor and cause havoc amongst the youma forces, distracting them 
while the remaining three would come from the stair entrance, and search 
for their two captured friends. Meanwhile, Luna and Artemis would wait 
outside the hotel in relative safety. Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Uranus 
had volunteered for the more dangerous task of distracting the youma. 
Sailor Mars would have taken the job, but she hadn&#146;t wanted to leave her 
princess&#146;s side.

Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, and Sailor Moon stood anxiously in the 
stairwell, waiting to hear Jupiter and Uranus engage the youma. Mars 
spared a glance at Mercury. She looked worried, no doubt thinking about 
Sailor Jupiter. It must have been hard to have your loyalty split 
between your love and your duty. At least Sailor Mars&#39; duty and love 
were rolled into one divine package that was Sailor Moon. Mars let out a 
barely audible sigh as she gazed at her princess. The blonde had been 
giving her strange looks all night, almost if... the Fire Senshi shook 
her head. No, it couldn&#39;t be that.

&quot;I hear something,&quot; whispered Mercury, capturing Sailor Mars&#39; attention.

Sailor Mars strained her ears, and then heard twin wordless battle cries 
followed by a series of inhuman shrieks. Sailor Jupiter and Sailor 
Uranus had arrived.

&quot;Wait for a moment or two,&quot; Mars said casually, leaning against a wall, 
&quot;let them draw most of the youma to them first.&quot;

Sailor Mercury swallowed nervously, but nodded. Sailor Moon merely gave 
Mars another weird look again. After several minutes, with Mercury 
fidgeting restlessly all the while, it was time to go.

Sailor Mars took the point, easing open the door to the top floor a 
crack, and taking a cautious look around, the sounds of fighting echoing 
down the hallways. Youma corpses littered the floor, their many varying 
shades of blood staining the walls and lush carpets. But some of the 
carcasses were old; Mars noticed that some of the bloodstains had dried 
up. She surveyed her surroundings further, noting the multitude of red 
roses stuck in the walls, in the ceiling, and of course, in the fallen 
youma. So. It looked like the &#145;great prince&#146; had escaped by his self 
after all.

Seeing no live youma in the vicinity, Sailor Mars opened the door fully 
and stepped quietly out into the hall, signalling Sailor Moon and Sailor 
Mercury to follow with one hand. Mars&#39; princess gasped when she saw all 
the roses decorating the hallways.

&quot;H-He must have tried to fight his way out,&quot; she whispered, her eyes 
glistening with unshed tears. &quot;Oh, Mamoru is so brave...&quot;

Sailor Mars bit down on the wisecrack that was trying to escape her 
mouth. Rescuing the Tuxedo Kamen was going to be harder than she thought 
at this rate.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Sailor Mercury whispered earnestly, &quot;we can use the angle of 
the roses to determine where he was coming from. That is, if he&#39;s still 
here, or in the same holding area.&quot;

The trio of senshi moved silently down the hall, Mercury leading the way 
this time. Once they got to the end of the hallway, Sailor Mars pressed 
herself against the wall and peeked her head out, peering down the 
intersecting corridor.

&quot;All clear. Minako and M-Mamoru should be behind one of these doors, I 
think,&quot; stuttered Mars. She had trouble getting *his* name out.

Sailor Mercury nodded in agreement. &quot;You&#39;re right. Let&#146;s hurry up; 
Jupiter and Uranus can&#39;t hold out forever.&quot;

All three Sailor Senshi began warily checking doors, praying that there 
were no youma waiting behind any. Sailor Mars decided to concentrate on 
investigating storage rooms and closets. The youma would probably pack 
the two prisoners in there. At the third storage room she tried, the 
raven-haired girl found a collapsed man with a cape draped about him 
lying on the floor, his chest rising and falling slowly. Sailor Mars 
looked at Tuxedo Kamen dispassionately and took in his battered body, 
differently coloured towels scattered about the floor around him, having 
somehow fallen off their shelves. She turned her head towards Sailor 
Mercury and Sailor Moon and started to open her mouth to call them. But 
instead Mars stopped in mid breath, her mouth halfway open. She turned 
her hard gaze back to the injured prince. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier just to 
torch him, burning him until there was nothing left? Sailor Mars could 
say it was a youma she had destroyed; there would be no remains for 
identification. Tuxedo Kamen suddenly stirred from his slumber, his eyes 
opening a crack, interrupting the miko&#146;s dark thoughts.

&quot;Rei... is that you? Oh no, I&#39;m dead aren&#39;t I?&quot; he croaked out in a weak 
voice.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Mars answered coldly.

The Senshi of Fire felt one corner of her mouth twitch unconsciously. 
She could feel the black flames of hate burn higher and stronger in her 
heart, threatening to consume it. Yes... it could work. Sailor Mars 
could finally carve her own destiny. The other Sailor Senshi would never 
know... they would assume the youma had killed him. Sailor Moon would be 
devastated of course, but who better to pick up the pieces and comfort 
the distraught princess than her faithful bodyguard and best friend? 
Sailor Mars&#39; lips twitched more, pulling her mouth up into a smug, 
sinister half-smile.

Mars looked back at Sailor Moon, seeing the reason for her existence. It 
would be so easy... here and now she could take the reigns of Fate and 
guide them to her own happiness. The princess and prince couldn&#39;t have a 
future, a destiny, if the prince died in Sailor Mars&#39; flames.

Sailor Moon turned her head and met Sailor Mars&#39; intense stare. &quot;Did you 
find them?&quot; she asked, her voice waveringly slightly.

Sailor Mars looked into her only love&#39;s shiny blue eyes, seeing the hope 
in them. Hope for her friend&#39;s safety, and the safety of her true love, 
Tuxedo Kamen. Sailor Mars blinked rapidly. What had she been thinking? 
Murder her princess&#39;s soul mate? How could she even consider such a 
thing?! Mars had sworn an oath that she would get Sailor Moon&#39;s prince 
back for her, and she would *not* break it. Sailor Mars may be doomed to 
eternal loneliness, but Sailor Moon was not. And Mars would not deny 
Sailor Moon her lover... even if it were not her. The undying flames of 
love for her princess strengthened and rolled over the black fire of 
hate in the miko&#146;s heart, overwhelming them.

Sailor Mars put on a smile. &quot;Yes, I&#39;ve found Tuxedo Kamen... but he&#39;s 
hurt,&quot; she said.

Sailor Moon and Sailor Mercury hurried over to the storage room, Sailor 
Mars stepping out of the way.

&quot;Mamoru!&quot; cried Sailor Moon, kneeling down beside her love and hugging 
him.

Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s eyes fluttered open more and turned to Sailor Moon&#39;s 
face. &quot;Usa-ko...&quot; He gave a strained smile, which he must have thought 
would be comforting for Sailor Moon.

&quot;Oh, what have they done to you?!&quot; sobbed Sailor Moon as she looked at 
her lover&#146;s beaten body, tears starting to roll down her face.

Sailor Mars could watch no longer. She turned away from the sight and 
leaned against the wall by the door, swallowing hard. Sailor Mercury 
smiled sympathetically at the heart-broken girl. Mars ignored her. She 
didn&#39;t need her pity. Sailor Mars ground her teeth in determination. She 
had already settled her feelings back at Makoto&#39;s apartment. Mars would 
protect Sailor Moon, nothing more. So that&#39;s what she would focus on; it 
was the reason she had come back to her princess in the first place, or 
had she forgotten? Sailor Mars clenched her fists tightly, her knuckles 
cracking as she blocked out the two lovers&#39; whispers of affection. Duty. 
That&#39;s all Sailor Mars had, the duty to protect her princess. But she 
would do that duty like no other senshi; nothing would harm Sailor Moon, 
every threat to her love&#146;s safety would be erased by her hand.

Sailor Mars turned towards the storage room entrance as Tuxedo Kamen and 
Sailor Moon staggered out, the blonde supporting the prince. Sailor 
Mercury moved to Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s other side, giving extra help.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; the man stated, &quot;I can stand.&quot;

The pair of Sailor Senshi let Tuxedo Kamen go, but he swayed a little on 
his feet causing Sailor Moon to move to support him once again. However 
the prince waved her away and steadied himself.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; he said reassuringly, plucking his missing hat and mask from 
what seemed like thin air and putting them on. &quot;I just have a score to 
settle with someone...&quot; He balled one hand into a fist and scowled in 
anger.

&quot;Have you seen Sailor Venus?&quot; inquired Sailor Mercury.

Tuxedo Kamen face crumpled at the mention of the Senshi of Love. Sailor 
Mars knew it couldn&#39;t be a good sign.

&quot;She&#39;s... not the same. The leader of the youma did something to her, 
brainwashed her...&quot; he said as Sailor Moon starting dabbing at the cuts 
on his face with a towel taken from the pile on the floor.

&quot;Where is this youma leader?&quot; asked Sailor Mars in a monotone voice.

Tuxedo Kamen looked at Mars, as if just really seeing her for the first 
time. &quot;You&#39;re alive! I thought I was hallucinating before...&quot;

&quot;No, you were not. Where can I find the leader?&quot; Sailor Mars asked 
again, her voice hardening somewhat.

&quot;I can show you,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen said grimly.

The group of four advanced down the hallway, the corpses of all kinds of 
youma getting more and more dense as they went. Sailor Jupiter and 
Sailor Uranus had obviously had some fun. They turned a corner and saw 
the other two senshi waiting outside two large, ornate, wooden double 
doors. Both Jupiter and Uranus were breathing heavily and sported 
numerous cuts and bruises on their bodies but otherwise looked all 
right.

&quot;They just ran away,&quot; panted Sailor Uranus.

&quot;Yeah, those cowards, all you have to do is kill a dozen or two and they 
lose all nerve to fight you,&quot; added an equally breathless Sailor 
Jupiter.

Sailor Mercury abruptly threw her arms around Sailor Jupiter and 
embraced her tightly, which the brunette returned just as eagerly, the 
intimate display surprising Sailor Mars and the others, especially since 
their normally quite shy friend had initiated it. After a moment, 
Mercury loosened her hold and looked up at the tall senshi.

&quot;Just a dozen?&quot; she said with a raised eyebrow.

&quot;Or two,&quot; Jupiter replied with a smirk.

Sailor Uranus chuckled. &quot;You two better cut that out; if Luna saw you do 
that during Sailor business she&#39;d go ballistic.&quot;

&quot;Luna isn&#39;t here,&quot; Jupiter said, grinning impishly.

Sailor Mars looked on at the two lovers&#39; hi-jinks, watching without 
expression. She refused to look at Sailor Moon and fantasise. The Senshi 
of Fire was done with things like that.

&quot;We found Tuxedo Kamen,&quot; Mars declared rather harshly, cutting off 
anymore banter. &quot;And the leader of the youma is behind these doors. 
Let&#146;s go.&quot;

Sailor Mars marched towards the double doors, aware of Sailor Moon 
giving her the peculiar look yet again. The raven-haired girl pushed 
open the doors and moved inside the finely decorated room, the other 
senshi and Tuxedo Kamen on her heels. To everyone&#146;s shock, Sailor Venus 
was standing on the opposite end of the room, near another set of high 
double doors, appearing none the worse for wear at all. She didn&#146;t 
appear surprised at the sight of Sailor Mars and her companions, as if 
she had been expecting them.

&quot;Minako...&quot; Sailor Moon whispered, taking a step towards her friend.

Tuxedo Kamen put a restraining hand on the blonde&#146;s shoulder, holding 
her back. &quot;She&#39;s not the Minako we know anymore,&quot; he warned gravely, 
&quot;she&#39;s with *them* now.&quot;

Sailor Venus ignored the conversation and glared at the group. &quot;I won&#39;t 
let any of you near her, you fiends!&quot; she cried out vehemently. &quot;In the 
name of Venus, I will punish you!&quot;

Sailor Moon shook off Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s hand and approached the Senshi of 
Love nevertheless, albeit with prudence.

&quot;Minako... don&#39;t you remember? It&#39;s me, Usagi...&quot; Sailor Moon said 
softly, pointing to herself as she walked slowly towards the other 
blonde.

Venus stood stock still for a second, as if recollecting something. 
&quot;Usagi...? Yes... I remember...&quot; she said, a wide smile growing on her 
features.

Sailor Moon met the smile with one of her own and moved more quickly 
towards her friend, her arms slightly outstretched and eyes bright.

All of a sudden Sailor Venus&#39; smile turned into a demonic sneer. 
&quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot;

Sailor Mars beat Tuxedo Kamen to the punch, leaping upon Sailor Moon and 
pushing her to the floor before anybody else could react. The ray of 
energy ripped across the Fire Senshi&#146;s back as she fell on top of her 
princess, tearing her fuku and singeing flesh. Sailor Mars grabbed on to 
Sailor Moon and hastily rolled the two of them behind the protection of 
a love seat. The miko heard Uranus curse and Venus fire another bolt of 
yellow light at the other Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen, forcing them 
all to dive for cover.

&quot;Minako...&quot; Sailor Moon whispered again, her voice thick with emotion.

Sailor Mars felt another fire start to flare up inside of her, the fire 
of duty, of determination... of vengeance. It blazed hotter than ever 
before, as if fuelled by some outside source. Someone had tried to kill 
her princess. Someone had threatened her princess&#39;s life. And like all 
threats to Mars&#39; only love, that someone would PAY!

A Crescent Beam blasted through the love seat just above Sailor Moon and 
Sailor Mars&#39; heads, burning a hole in the wall behind them. Mars ignored 
it and stood up, revealing herself openly as a target despite the 
danger. The fire inside her burned like fury, her mind focusing only on 
the thought of protecting her princess. Sailor Mars pulled out an ofuda.

&quot;Rin, pyou, tou, sha, kai, jin, retsu, sai, zen. Akuryou taisan!&quot;

The miko causally threw the ward in the air in front of her, the corners 
of her mouth twitching upwards once again.

&quot;FIRE SOUL BIRD!&quot;

A Fire Soul flew out from her fingertips and collided with the ofuda, 
combining with its divine power and bursting into a blazing phoenix, 
before the bird shrieked furiously towards Sailor Venus. Sailor Mars was 
distantly aware of people shouting, and something pulling at her leg. 
And also mad laughter. But she blocked out all distractions. There was a 
threat to her princess to be dealt with.

Sailor Venus&#39; eyes widened in panic as the bird of flame rocketed 
towards her, its fiery beak open and ready to consume its prey. The 
Senshi of Love dived desperately to her left, trying to evade the 
vengeful flames. But the phoenix corrected its course, crashing into the 
girl&#39;s back and exploding, setting her fuku ablaze. Sailor Venus 
screamed in agony and rolled frantically on the carpet, somehow managing 
to smother the flames out of existence.

Sailor Mars walked with murderous intent towards the prone figure, the 
corners of her mouth jerking upwards to curve into a sinister smile. The 
fire of duty devoured everything inside of Mars, the inferno hotter than 
the flames of Hell, her lavender eyes smouldering with self-righteous 
hatred for the one who would attack her princess. The Moon Princess&#39;s 
bodyguard bent down to the half-scorched threat, wrapping her hands 
tightly around its throat and hauling it viciously up onto its feet. She 
squeezed at the threat&#39;s air passage attempting to snuff the very life 
out of it with her bare hands. The threat batted feebly at the Senshi of 
Fire&#146;s arms, trying to save its pathetic existence. Didn&#39;t it know that 
Mars was its executioner? It had attacked her princess, a crime that was 
punishable by death.

As Sailor Mars crushed the throat of the threat, she became aware of 
people pulling at her, trying to restrain her. Mars heard a hysterical 
voice call her name from miles away, a voice she recognised. It was her 
princess who was calling her, no doubt encouraging her bodyguard to make 
the threat to her safety suffer. Suffer? No... Mars&#39; princess wasn&#39;t 
like that. Why would her compassionate princess want someone to suffer?

Sailor Mars concentrated, controlling the inferno within her heart and 
mind. The Fire Senshi&#39;s eyes refocused, coming back to reality to see 
Sailor Venus&#39; blue oxygen-deprived face in front of her, the girl&#39;s 
hands dangled weakly by her sides. Sailor Moon was crying and screaming 
at her to stop, pulling on her arms with all her strength, just as the 
other senshi and Tuxedo Kamen were. Sailor Mars let go of Venus as if 
scalded, her limp body dropping to the floor. Mars looked down at her 
friend in pure disbelief. No... NO! What had she done? What had she 
DONE?! Sailor Mars&#146; arms fell like lead weights to her sides, her 
lavender eyes wide and mouth open, totally stunned.

Sailor Mercury and Sailor Moon knelt quickly by Venus&#39; side, the Senshi 
of Water desperately checking for a pulse on the blonde&#39;s black and blue 
throat. Sailor Moon sobbed, tears streaming down her face as she held on 
to one of her friend&#39;s limp hands. She looked up at Sailor Mars with 
tear-flooded blue eyes and suddenly the Fire Senshi knew with terrible 
realisation what was in the look her princess had been giving her all 
night. Fear. But now it wasn&#39;t just fear, but horror, shock, and 
confusion as well. Sailor Moon&#39;s blue eyes looked into Mars&#39; lavender 
ones and seemed to ask the question &#39;why?&#39; over and over again.

Sailor Mars took a step backwards, shaking her head weakly, at the same 
moment Sailor Mercury began CPR. But it was her princess&#39;s accusing eyes 
that made her retreat. Fear and horror. Sailor Moon looked at Mars as if 
she were a monster. But the blonde girl was right; she *was* a monster. 
Sailor Mars couldn&#39;t take her true love looking at her that way. Mars 
hadn&#39;t just killed her friend, but she had killed whatever platonic 
relationship she used to have with Sailor Moon. Twin tears trickled out 
of her amethyst eyes, eyes that had a broken appearance, the teardrops 
running down her face unchecked. Now Sailor Mars truly had nothing left.

And behind the two double doors, she heard a woman laugh. Mad laughter. 
The laugher of the victorious.
