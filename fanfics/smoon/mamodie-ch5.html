---Omake Five: Shishkabob---

Chibi Usa was once again visiting the past when a youma began running 
wild in the shopping district. She went with Sailor Moon and the others, 
only to find the quick moving monster too much for them.

&quot;We&#39;re sunk!&quot; Sailor Jupiter hissed.

&quot;Usagi-chan, I&#39;m scared.&quot; Chibi Usa admitted. Before the future queen 
and mother could answer her daughter, a rose flew down in front of the 
youma standing in front of an electronics store, signaling the arrival 
of Tuxedo Kamen. More good news came with the arrival of Sailor Saturn 
and the other Outers.

&quot;Silence wall!&quot; Saturn called out. Sailor Venus then made her move.

&quot;Venus Love-Me Chain!&quot; she shouted, trapping the now disoriented youma 
in the chain of hearts, &quot;Now Sailor Moon!&quot;

Sailor Moon used her &quot;Moon Tiara Action&quot; attack, destroying the monster. 
Sailor Saturn smiled with the other Senshi as she rested her Silence 
Glaive casually on her shoulder, Tuxedo Kamen coming down and landing 
next to the young Outer.

Chibi Usa, seeing her best friend, waved to her excitedly.

&quot;Hotaru-chan!&quot; Chibi Usa cried cheerfully. Sailor Saturn happily turned 
quickly toward the voice of her best friend, her Silence Glaive still 
resting on her shoulder.

Ka-Thunk!

At first Saturn didn&#39;t understand the horrified looks of her fellow 
Senshi. She then turned around to see what everyone was staring at.

There was Tuxedo Kamen, his head impaled on the end of the Silence 
Glaive. Horrified, she pulled it out, at which point the hero fell in a 
heap to the ground.

&quot;No!&quot; Usagi screamed in anguish. Ami quickly ran over to check on Tuxedo 
Kamen&#39;s condition as Rei went to Usagi&#39;s side. Chibi Usa was likewise 
grief stricken at first, but her initial anguish was quickly replaced by 
puzzlement.

&quot;Hey, wait a second,&quot; the overly-kawaii, pink haired girl said, &quot;If 
Mamo-chan&#39;s dead, then shouldn&#39;t I cease to...&quot;

Poof!

Everyone looked on as Chibi Usa suddenly disappeared. Sailor Saturn, 
loosing the best friend she ever had started to cry on her Haruka-papa&#39;s 
shoulder as Rei hugged Usagi consolingly.

&quot;Usagi&quot; Rei said, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry Mamoru&#39;s dead, but...&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s not quite dead yet.&quot; Ami called over. Rei raised an eyebrow at 
that.

&quot;Usagi,&quot; the Senshi of Fire began again, &quot;I know Mamo-chan&#39;s mortally 
wounded, but...&quot;

&quot;Actually, he&#39;s feeling much better.&quot; Ami called over again. Rei made a 
face as she snapped her fingers, and immediately two suspiciously 
familiar looking crows attacked Mamoru, ripping him to shreds.

&quot;Well, he&#39;s dead now.&quot; Ami sighed. Rei tried to hide her annoyance as 
she looked back over to Usagi.

&quot;ANYWAYS, like I was trying to say, Mamoru&#39;s dead Usagi, and I&#39;m here. I 
may not be Mamoru, but I could make you happy Usagi-chan. I know I 
could, if you let me.&quot;

Usagi looked sorrowfully at her friend and fellow Senshi, &quot;But... But 
how can I ever be happy again? I didn&#39;t just loose Mamo-chan, I lost 
Chibi Usa as well.&quot;

Suddenly, the display TV in the window of the electronics store blared 
out, &quot;This is a news special report; new hope for lesbians who want 
children but who don&#39;t want to go the route of adoption or sperm 
donation. Scientists in Sweden have discovered a way to combine the DNA 
from two egg cells to produce a viable fetus. They say...&quot;

Poof!

Suddenly, Chibi Usa reappeared. As Hotaru ran joyfully to hug her best 
friend, Usagi wiped the tears from her eyes as she looked at Rei, now 
seeing more than just a friend in the familiar features of her fellow 
Senshi.
