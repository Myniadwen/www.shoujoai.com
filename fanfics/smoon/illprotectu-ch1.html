<h1>I'll Protect You (part 1 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is it. My concert was another success! I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m now 
a star and people idolize me. This is all I ever wanted. But still, 
there is one thing that I also dreamed of other than being a pop star, 
and that is to find someone who will love and take care of me for the 
rest of my life. I have lots of male admirers, but all I can see from 
their eyes is lust, not love or even crush. There are also female 
admirers, they seem &#39;kinda interesting...Nah! What the heck am I 
thinking? Oh yeah, time to go to the back stage!

Minako Aino, the famous singer all over Europe and Asia had just 
finished her concert in a big theater in Paris. As she heads towards the 
backstage a tall, slim short-haired blonde woman immediately approached 
her.

&quot;Aino we better hurry up, we still have a flight to catch!&quot; said her 
Irish manager

&quot;Can&#39;t we just rest for a while? My feet got tired of dancing...&quot; The 
pop star complained

&quot;You can rest in the plane, besides it is a twelve-hour ride. Aren&#39;t you 
excited to come back in Japan, your homeland?&quot;

&quot;Of course I&#39;m excited! It&#39;s just that...geez, after an exhausting 
concert, a homecoming flight?&quot; Pouted Minako

&quot;It&#39;s because we are saving your precious schedule Aino, and I&#39;m telling 
you we&#39;re not on vacation there in Japan. We will only stay there for 
only one week.&quot; Said her manager as they walk out of the backstage to 
the dressing room, Minako just sighed.

Meanwhile in Tokyo Police Headquarters...

&quot;We are assigned for the security when the time the pop star Minako Aino 
arrives here in Tokyo. Therefore we must provide Aino-san a personal 
bodyguard in order to protect her fully.&quot; The head chief of the police 
said, as he lectures the police task force what to do. As he mention 
that the pop star needs to have a personal bodyguard, they made an 
&#39;ahem&#39; noise to make the head chief notice them and choose them to be 
Minako Aino&#39;s personal bodyguard. But it seems the head chief is not 
going to choose any of them. Then there&#39;s a sound of a door being 
opened. A not so tall but young girl about 18 years young with long, 
smooth black hair and shining cerulean eyes came in through the door

&quot;Oh there you are Hino, just the right person for the job!&quot; The head 
chief said as he approaches the raven-haired girl.

&quot;What did I do? I&#39;m just five minutes late, right? Please don&#39;t make me 
clean your office again, chief!&quot; She pleaded

&quot;No, it&#39;s not that Rei Hino! Sit down first and listen to me&quot; The head 
chief hastily said to make it clear for the young agent. She sighed in 
relief and sat down to the nearest chair to her. She noticed that all 
her fellow policemen are gazing at her.

&quot; What are you guys staring at?&quot; Rei said as her temper begin to rise up 
fast. This is what her fellow agents scare them, her limited control of 
her temper. So they quickly turn their eyes away from her; because if 
they take another glimpse of those flaming eyes, they&#39;re history.

&quot;Now, now Hino, calm yourself down okay? I told you to listen to me&quot; The 
head chief said as his radar detects Rei&#39;s temper meter rising up, 
somehow Rei obeyed their head chief and begun to calm down listen to 
what ever he will say

&quot;Hino, since you are the most outstanding female agent here I can 
provide, I&#39;ll give you a very special task&quot; Said the head chief 
enthusiastically

&quot; Really chief? That sure sounds good...um...can I ask what is it? Is it 
a kidnap or murder case or a surprise operation?&quot; Rei asked excitedly 
like she seems to be expecting some live action in her new task

&quot;Well actually, all of what you said isn&#39;t going to be what you are 
going to do&quot;

&quot;What do you mean? Then what kind of case is this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a...well...how the hell am I going to explain this...oh, yeah. I 
know you are very familiar of Minako Aino, our very own Japanese pop 
star who became famous all over Asia and Europe. She is going to arrive 
here tomorrow morning and we, the Tokyo National Police Department were 
assigned for all security sorts and measures for Aino-san&#39;s safety&quot; The 
head chief stated

&quot;So, what are we suppose to do there?&quot; Said Rei

&quot;We? No Hino, you&#39;re not included with us. We are going to check and 
prepare all the area for security for her upcoming concert in the Tokyo 
dome. And you? I will assign you as Minako Aino&#39;s personal bodyguard&quot; 
The head chief finally stated. It took all the time in the world for Rei 
to realize what she was assigned to, and she seems unhappy with it

&quot;WWWWHHHAAATTT?&quot;

As Minako Aino and her staff and crew got into the plane going to Japan 
she glimpsed a last look at Paris. She&#39;s finally coming home. She really 
missed her parents and friends in there. She can&#39;t wait to see what 
changes had happened to her homeland. She&#39;ll definitely enjoy her 
homecoming; she won&#39;t listen to what her manager had said. What if the 
love of her life is just out there in Japan waiting for her? She doesn&#39;t 
have any idea what&#39;s in store for her.

&quot;Hey Aino, you&#39;re day dreaming again&quot;

&quot;Ofcourse I am! Imagine not seeing your homeland for about three years? 
I&#39;m so excited! But wait a minute...where are Sarah, Jane and Lacey, my 
bodyguards?&quot; Said Minako as she searches for the persons she mentioned

&quot;They can&#39;t join you in Japan, they were re-assigned to London for the 
fashion designer Les Grande&#39; Mercile&quot; Said her manager

&quot;Oh, is that so? I&#39;m going to miss them, they&#39;re really nice. So I don&#39;t 
have bodyguards for a while?&quot; Asked Minako

&quot;The Tokyo National Police Headquarters had provided you a personal 
bodyguard, and that bodyguard will meet us tomorrow to escort you to the 
hotel and guard you.&quot;

&quot;Wait, Personal bodyguard? You mean they sent me a pet dog to follow me 
around?&quot; said Minako looking in disbelief

&quot;What&#39;s the difference? Sarah and your other bodyguards follow you 
around too, right?&quot;

&quot;But they&#39;ve been my bodyguards and friends for almost two years and I 
knew them so I&#39;m confident with them&quot; Said Minako as she frown

&quot;Come on Aino, you&#39;ll only be spending a week with this person&quot; Said her 
manager, with this, Manako smiled a bit. Then her manager added,

&quot;Well, you should rest and sleep in order to store some energy and save 
some for your sightseeing.&quot;

&quot;I definitely will&quot; Minako rested her head and body to the plane chair

Back in Tokyo NPD

&quot;What do you mean I&#39;m going to be Aino&#39;s personal bodyguard! The word 
&#39;Bodyguard&#39;? I fully understand that, but PERSONAL BODYGUARD! Come on 
chief! I&#39;m not a baby sitter, try somebody else&quot; It was obvious that Rei 
didn&#39;t like the assigned job. So what if that&#39;s Minako Aino? Big deal 
she thought.

&quot;Hino, you don&#39;t have any other choice. With you being a non fanatic to 
Aino-san will help because you will get more concentration on protecting 
her. Besides we need a girl to do this job, not this bunch of idiots in 
here! Since you&#39;re almost as old as Aino-san you are perfect for the 
job, as what I had said before&quot; Explained the head chief

&quot;B-but&#151;&quot;

&quot;No buts Hino or you&#39;ll clean my office for one year!&quot;

&quot;Argh...Yes sir.&quot; Rei bowed down in defeat

&quot;Meet her tomorrow at six in the morning, better not be late Hino or 
I&#39;ll make the cleaning-the-office-thing multiply into ten years&quot; Warned 
the head chief. Rei let another deep sigh out of her mouth and went home 
to sleep early in order to avoid her client from waiting.

Rei woke up five in the morning; she prepared all her things including 
her &#39;Bodyguard&#39; uniform. She took a warm shower before going to the 
Tokyo International Airport. It was 5:45 in the morning, 15 minutes 
before the plane form England arrives. She made it sure she won&#39;t be 
late, or she&#39;ll spend half of her life cleaning their head chief&#39;s 
office. As she arrived in the airport she was welcomed by the airport 
assistants who expected her arrival. Some of them looked at her with 
lust in their eyes.

&quot;Lesbians&quot; She whispered as she shook her head lightly, and then she 
noticed some of them are looking very excited. Must be because Minako 
Aino is coming and they are dying in excitement to see the pop star. She 
also noticed that there are lots of media waiting for the pop star 
outside the airport main gate, she chuckled. They had no idea Aino-san 
isn&#39;t going out that main gate

Finally, it&#39;s 5:55am when the plane finally arrived.

&quot;This is it&quot; Said Rei as she breath out a deep sigh to lessen her 
nervousness

As the door of the plane opened, the staff of Minako Aino first came 
out, and next were her dancers. Finally Minako Aino came out with a 
waving hand followed by her manager. So, her fellow agents weren&#39;t 
joking when they mentioned Minako Aino is extremely beautiful. Rei 
thought.

Minako has a long golden blonde hair, very nice figure, skin a bit tan 
but smooth and flawless, must be from enjoying under the sun last 
summer. And Rei had witnessed the liveliest smile she only once saw in 
televisions, including the pair of live blue eyes which always glitter 
with joy and excitement. She never thought Minako Aino was this 
beautiful in person. True, she wasn&#39;t a fan of the pop star. But after 
seeing Minako in person, she had become interested and curious with the 
pop star, maybe she&#39;ll start by buying her album!

Rei removed her cool &#39;agent&#39; shades as she approaches Minako and her 
manager. Minako&#39;s manager seemed to expect Rei, but as Minako saw her 
new personal bodyguard her world had stopped for a second.

&#39;Whoa, is this my new personal bodyguard?&#39; Minako thought.

&#39;Who could resist a bodyguard this pretty...no; she is far from that, 
she&#39;s beautiful and awesome!&#39; She had imagined her new personal 
bodyguard to be big and a bit masculine just like what her bodyguards in 
England looked like. This was far from what she imagined her new 
bodyguard.

This personal bodyguard is perfect in any angle; 5&#39;9&#39;&#39; tall, long black 
hair that show shades of purple when the light passes through it, though 
it is pony tailed. Almost perfect milk white skin, and for the first 
time in her life, she saw a pair of glowing cerulean eyes. The most 
beautiful pair of eyes she had ever seen in her entire life. Not to 
mention the cute uniform she&#39;s wearing, a black Americana blouse with 
probably white long sleeves inside her dress, a cute brown necktie with 
white strips hanging on her sexy neck and slim black slacks paired her 
blouse and black shoes. They can tell she&#39;s the expected bodyguard 
because of the earphone that Rei is wearing in her ears (I have just 
remembered Agent Smith from The Matrix trilogy)

&quot;You must be the one that the TNPH had sent&quot; Said Minako&#39;s manager

&quot;Indeed, I&#39;m agent Hino Rei. Pleased to meet you miss...?&quot;

Said Rei as she expected the manager to continue her speech

&quot;...Wendy Denverland, I&#39;m Minako Aino&#39;s manager. And she&#39;s here beside 
me&quot; Said her manager as she pointed her hand to Minako, who blushed and 
waved cutely at her. Minako&#39;s manager was thankful this Japanese agent 
can speak English, not mention how fluent her English were. Rei reached 
her hand to shake Wendy&#39;s hand and then turn to shake hands with Minako, 
whose blush had worsened as she reaches her own hand to the agent.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you Aino-san. And welcome back!&quot; &#39;God, her hands were 
really soft...&#39; Rei thought

&quot;Nice to meet you too...&quot; Minako giggled as she whispered &#39;cutie&#39; when 
she turned to face to the direction of her manager. They all walked 
towards the hallway of the airport, and the excited airport assistants 
were calling and waving to Minako who exchanged smiles and waved her 
hands to them. They passed at the very back of the airport to avoid 
paparazzi and media, as Wendy had requested to the TNPH.

&quot;Tokyo N-P-H, this is Raven speaking&quot; Rei said as she holds the speaker 
of her earphone

&quot;Tokyo N-P-H this is Condor come in, Raven&quot; A male voice came out from 
Rei&#39;s earphone

&quot;Yes Condor, I have pop babe and her manager here. We are heading to the 
Hotel they&#39;re going to stay in.&quot; Rei said as she assisted Minako and 
Wendy inside the black luxury car. Then she got herself inside the car 
in the driver&#39;s seat.

&quot;Whoa! Rei is it true? What does Minako Aino look like in person?&quot; Said 
&#39;Condor&#39; as she heard the other voice of her fellow agents in the 
earphone said &#39;Yeah Rei, what did she look like there with you?&#39; and 
&#39;Rei, ask some autograph for us pleeeeaaassseee!&#39; Rei&#39;s temper had 
increased; she doesn&#39;t want to give those bakas a favor

&quot;Autograph your ass, go ask for it yourselves! I&#39;m not doing any favors 
from you guys!&quot; Rei said, having the great difficulty to control being 
pissed with her fellow agents. When she finally realized she wasn&#39;t 
alone, she blushed profusely

&quot;Heh-heh...sorry about that...&quot; Rei said with an honest apology. Minako 
just giggled, Wendy blinked a few times then smiled a bit. Rei placed 
her hand on her forehead as she slapped herself mentally out of her 
embarrassing actions

&quot;Big boss is going to make me clean his office forever if he just heard 
this...&quot; Rei whispered and sweat dropped, Minako is just watching her 
with amusement. She heard what the cute agent had whispered

Rei sighed then continued

&quot;Welcome to Tokyo. I&#39;ll be driving you to the Tokyo luxury hotel&quot;

&quot;Are you staying with us? You&#39;re my personal bodyguard right?&quot; Minako 
asked Rei with a sexy voice

&quot;Uh...well...I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll ask my head chief about that when we 
arrive at the hotel&quot; Rei suddenly felt a little discomfort when she 
heard the &#39;staying&#39; thing. Wendy was mildly surprised that Minako 
started a conversation with the bodyguard, for Wendy, it was a bit 
awkward for Minako to be the one interviewing somebody else</pre>
