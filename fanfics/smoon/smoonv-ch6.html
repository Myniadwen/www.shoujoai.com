<h1>Sailor Moon V: The Dark Adventures of the Sailor Scouts (part 6 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tstanton.html">Troy "Silver" Stanton</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/smoonv-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&lt;Historian&#39;s Note: This episode takes place three months after the 
original episode entitled &quot;Time Enough For Love.&quot;&gt; 

Time flowed strangely in The Dark. While the flow of Time seemed to be 
even and continuous inside the neo-void, it was quite chaotic when 
compared to the flow of Time in another dimension. The discovery of 
the consciousness inside the burnt-out shell of the soul took only a 
handful of minutes from her perspective, but the same span of Time 
covered three months in the small branch of Time that was the place of 
origin for the soul. 

&lt;....my name is.... Pluto....&gt; the soul said hesitantly as it woke up. 

Most interesting, she thought as she continued to examine the small 
ball of light. This soul has been virtually dead for almost a thousand 
years, and now it&#39;s talking to me. 

&lt;....who.... who are you?&gt; the soul continued. 

She blinked as she considered the question. She did have a name, but 
it was not something to be shared, for the knowledge of the true-name 
of an inhabitant of The Dark meant absolute power over the individual. 
It was said that those who have lived in the neo-void the longest have 
gone by other names for so long that they have forgotten their own 
true-name. 

&lt;My name is not important,&gt; she said after a moment&#39;s thought. &lt;What 
is important right now is to figure out what to do with you.&gt; 

&lt;I must.... find someone....&gt; the soul replied at once. 

She blinked again, amazed by how fast the soul was recovering. &lt;Who? 
Who do you have to find?&gt; she asked the soul, not entirely sure why 
she was doing so. 

&lt;Others....&gt; 

She blinked again, now totally confused. &lt;What others?&gt; 

&lt;Others who were.... were.... !&gt; 

She could sense the soul&#39;s frustration at being unable to remember. 
&lt;You are still waking up,&gt; she said soothingly, &lt;You need to give 
yourself time to remember.&gt; 

&lt;Time?&gt; the soul said slowly, as if speaking an unfamiliar word. 
&lt;Yes.... Time.... I.... I remember now.... I must find those who were 
trapped in the temporal vortex with me when.... when.... ?&gt; 

She blinked yet again, the soul&#39;s fragmented thoughts beginning to 
slowly make sense to her. &lt;Others? You mean there are other souls like 
you?&gt; 

&lt;Yes.... Others like me.... Were with me when we were.... attacked?&gt; 

She took a slow breath and sat back, letting the soul work out her 
train of thought on her own. Her? she thought for a moment before she 
nodded. Yes, this &#39;Pluto&#39; was definitely female, she decided. 

&lt;We were....attacked by.... someone.... was trapped in a vortex 
with.... with.... N.... Neptune?.... Yes.... Yes, Neptune.... And one 
other.... S.... No, not her.... other one.... Uranus.... That&#39;s it! I 
was trapped here with Neptune and Uranus during the attack....&gt; 

&lt;You say there are two others like you here?&gt; she said when Pluto fell 
silent, exhausted from the effort of remembering. 

&lt;Yes, Uranus and Neptune were right next to me when.... when....&gt; 

&lt;When you got trapped?&gt; she reminded Pluto. 

&lt;Yes, but I can&#39;t remember how....&gt; Pluto thought. &lt;Time.... Time.... 
I think it had to do with Time.... Something about the.... key? The 
key to.... Time? The key to Time? Yes.... yes.... the key to Time....&gt; 

She frowned lightly when Pluto&#39;s thoughts started to become slightly 
more fragmented. &lt;You are still tired and weak, my friend,&gt; she said 
soothingly without thinking about it. &lt;You should rest for awhile. 
Your memories will return to you in time.&gt; 

&lt;I don&#39;t have time,&gt; Pluto replied, then fell silent as her words 
echoed inside her soul-mind. &lt;Don&#39;t have Time.... don&#39;t have.... the 
key.... don&#39;t have the key to Time.... !!!&gt; 

She jumped back as Pluto&#39;s soul started to pulse with energy. Her 
first thought was that she was being attacked, but her defensive 
impulses quickly faded when she realized that Pluto was in a severe 
state of panic. &lt;What? What is it?&gt; she asked, reflexively casting a 
wary eye around her tiny keep. 

&lt;That&#39;s how we were trapped here! That warrior I was fighting 
destroyed my staff! Without it, the portal to Time is sealed!&gt; Pluto 
thought, still highly agitated at the thought. 

She frowned as Pluto&#39;s words failed to make much sense. &lt;I.... don&#39;t 
quite understand what you mean, Pluto.&gt; 

&lt;I don&#39;t have time to explain,&gt; Pluto replied. &lt;I must find my friends 
and return to the Moon Kingdom at once. Every second the Time Portal 
remains closed brings our universe that much closer to a catastrophic 
disaster that not even the gods will be able to repair.&gt; 

She frowned again as something clicked within her memory. &lt;You are 
from this.... Moon Kingdom?&gt; 

&lt;I am the avatar of my god in that kingdom, if that&#39;s what you mean. 
You know of the Moon Kingdom, then?&gt; Pluto asked slowly, calming down 
slightly. 

&lt;No, but I know of someone who has spoken of it before.&gt; She 
hesistated only a moment before she made up her mind. &lt;Come on, I will 
take you to him,&gt; she thought towards the soul as she gathered it up 
and put it in her storage pouch. She looked around her tiny sanctuary 
to make sure everything was secure before she concentrated her 
internal energies and dimension-shifted into another portion of The 
Dark. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Leda sighed and let her head fall forward, smacking into the open 
biology textbook with a dull thump. &quot;I give up,&quot; she said, her words 
muffled by the mass of paper mashed against her face. 

Ami absently patted her on the shoulder, most of her attention still 
focused on the textbook in front of her. &quot;Take a break and come back 
to it,&quot; she said as she studied the advanced mathematics problem she 
was currently working on. &quot;It&#39;ll make sense in a few minutes.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s what you said half an hour ago,&quot; Leda replied as she 
straightened herself up with a heavy sigh. &quot;This thing still isn&#39;t 
making any sense.&quot; She didn&#39;t even bother looking up when a steaming 
mug slid across the table to come to a halt in front of her. &quot;Thanks, 
Mina,&quot; she said as she picked up the mug and downed half of the 
contents in one gulp. 

The blonde&#39;s head suddenly snapped up from her physics textbook, her 
blue eyes darting frantically around the room. &quot;What? What I&#39;d do?&quot; 
she blurted out in confusion. 

&quot;Nothing, I did it,&quot; Rei replied with a small frown as she glanced up 
from her own studies. &quot;When in doubt, Leda, carry the two.&quot; 

Leda blinked and looked down at her book. &quot;This is biology, Rei, not 
math. There&#39;s no two to carry.&quot; 

The priestess blinked for a moment before she shrugged. &quot;Can&#39;t help 
you, then. Could someone wake up Serena before she starts snoring 
again?&quot; 

Leda fished an ice cube out of Ami&#39;s cup of juice and tossed it across 
the room, bouncing it off of the top of the blonde&#39;s head with amazing 
accuracy. Serena immediately bolted upright, her blue eyes nearly 
twice their usual size with surprise. &quot;Yiii! I&#39;m up, I&#39;m up!&quot; she 
squealed. 

&quot;That&#39;s nice,&quot; Ami said distantly as she started scribbling furiously 
on a scratch piece of paper before writing down the answer on her 
homework paper. &quot;Mina,&quot; she said quietly. 

Mina jumped again, startled out of her studies. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t forget to include the delta-v in your third equation,&quot; Ami 
replied without looking up from her paper. &quot;Mr. Meyers wants all parts 
of the physics model to be defined correctly.&quot; 

Mina blinked in confusion and looked down at her paper. &quot;But I&#39;m only 
on the second equation.&quot; 

&quot;Keep working at it, it&#39;ll make sense soon,&quot; Ami said soothingly as 
she continued to crunch numbers at a mind-numbing pace. 

Rei sighed as she reached for the nearly empty bowl of fruit. &quot;How do 
you do that without a calculator?&quot; she said tiredly as she searched 
for a banana that wasn&#39;t too badly bruised. 

Serena looked down at her own mathematics textbook and sighed heavily. 
&quot;Nevermind the calculator, how do you do that problem period?&quot; she 
asked in a weary tone. 

&quot;When in doubt, carry the two,&quot; Rei offered. 

&quot;And what was your final grade in math last year?&quot; Leda inquired. 

&quot;Umm....&quot; Rei said, her cheeks turning a light pink color. 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go study your history lesson and let us worry about 
helping Serena with the math?&quot; Leda suggested gently. She blinked as 
there was a heavy thunking sound as another head hit the table in 
frustration. &quot;Cheer up, Mina, it can&#39;t be that bad.&quot; 

&quot;What was the equation for work again?&quot; Mina muttered, her voice 
muffled by the textbook pressed up against her nose. 

&quot;Force times displacement,&quot; Ami responded immediately. &quot;Think of it 
like this: work equals force times displacement. Force is mass times 
acceleration. The most common variable for mass is m, a for 
acceleration, and d for linear displacement. So put it together and 
you have m times a times d. String the letters together and what does 
it spell?&quot; she reiterated without glancing up. 

Mina blinked. &quot;Mad.&quot; 

&quot;Exactly. If you remember the mnemonic &#39;work makes me mad,&#39; 
substituting the equal sign in place of &#39;makes me,&#39; then you will 
remember that work equals mass times acceleration times displacement,&quot; 
Ami said slowly and calmly. 

Four minds thought about that for a brief moment before there was a 
brief scramble for paper as Mina, Serena, Rei, and Leda all tried to 
write down that tiny fragment of wisdom before they forgot it. &quot;Ami, 
you&#39;re a genius,&quot; Mina cooed as she scribbled. 

Ami sighed and finally looked up from her work. &quot;If you had been 
paying attention in class like you should have been, Mina, you would 
have remembered Mr. Meyers telling us that.&quot; 

Mina smirked. &quot;Why do I need to pay attention when I&#39;ve got you as a 
handy reference?&quot; 

Serena giggled. &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been saying about the classes I&#39;ve 
had with her in the past.&quot; 

&quot;And what of your grades in those classes?&quot; Ami replied reprovingly. 

Serena blinked and blushed. &quot;Well....&quot; There was yet another heavy 
thunk as yet another head hit the table in frustration, followed by 
gentle words of encouragement by Ami. 

Dragoon Lieutenant Maze leaned against the entraceway to the dining 
room, silently watching the five girls try to study their school 
homework. Makes me glad I&#39;m past those days, he mused. This could get 
amusing after awhile, he thought as Rei picked her head up off the 
table. Of course at this rate, everyone except Ami is going to have 
impact headaches by dinnertime. 

Shaking his head to himself, Maze stood up straight and walked down 
the hallway towards the cathedral&#39;s central computer, a small smile of 
amusement still on his lips. He walked past the open door and was 
about to say something to the room&#39;s occupant but stopped when he 
heard the heavy sound of a forehead meeting the leading edge of a 
Negaverse-design crystal computer. 

&quot;One of those days already, boss?&quot; he quipped as he sat down in an 
empty chair next to Tolaris. 

Dragoon Commander Tolaris sighed quietly as he lifted his head up from 
the computer screen and rubbed at his temples. &quot;Maze, this has been 
driving me up the wall for hours now. See if you can make sense of 
it,&quot; he explained as he turned the crystalline monitor so Maze could 
get a better look. 

Maze glanced at the display, blinked hard and did a double-take, and 
sat back with a deep frown on his face. &quot;Tell me that&#39;s not a search 
worm.&quot; 

&quot;It is,&quot; Tolaris said with a grunt. 

Maze closed his eyes and sighed. The whole purpose of a search worm 
was to check something out in a distant computer and report back what 
it found. &quot;Did it already send out its reply?&quot; 

&quot;Just as soon as I discovered it,&quot; Tolaris said quietly. 

&quot;So Rune knows we&#39;re here now?&quot; Maze said softly. 

Tolaris blinked and gave Maze a curious look. &quot;Rune has known that for 
some time now, Lieutenant. Why she hasn&#39;t acted on that is beyond me, 
but she definitely knows about Nephlyte&#39;s base being used by us, as 
well as the fact that the dimensional phase-link to his computer is 
still active.&quot; 

Maze sat up with another frown. &quot;So why the search worm, then?&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;I suppose we&#39;ll find out eventually.&quot; 

&quot;Wait a second, boss....&quot; Maze said slowly as something bubbled up 
from the depths of his memory. &quot;When I discoverd that the phase-link 
was still in use by you, I rerouted it so it looks like an ordinary 
remote link. I did it myself, so there couldn&#39;t be any way that Rune 
knows about it.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned and looked at the computer screen, trying to figure 
out this latest development. Both Dragoons jumped slightly when the 
computer emitted a soft tone, indicating that a network service 
message had been sent to their terminal. 

Both denizens exchanged glances before Maze pulled out his 
communicator and opened a channel to Ra&#39;vel and Whisper, asking them 
to come to the computer room immediately. Maze had barely finished 
putting his communicator back in his pocket when the air shimmered 
briefly as Psi-Corp Captain Whisper and Dragoon Lieutenant Ra&#39;vel 
teleported into the room. Tolaris and Maze blinked hard when they 
realized that Whisper was wearing only a towel and was dripping water 
everywhere. 

&quot;I was in the shower,&quot; she said mildly in response to their looks. 
&quot;With all due respect, Lieutenant, this had better be very good.&quot; 

&quot;I think this might prove to be worth your time,&quot; Tolaris replied 
evenly as he turned his attention back to the computer and opened the 
message. All four of the denizens leaned forward slightly in 
anticipation as the message began to scroll up onto the screen.

No one spoke for a moment, the only sound being heard was the steady 
drip of water on to the floor. &quot;So K&#39;tal is in command of the Dragoons 
now,&quot; Maze said softly. &quot;Not a bad choice, to be honest.&quot; 

&quot;He&#39;s a little too gung-ho, in my opinion, but he is one of the best,&quot; 
Tolaris agreed. &quot;My question is, why did he send us this message?&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped softly as she reread the message, trying to vocalize 
her ideas. Whisper shook her head, accidentally spashing water 
droplets all over Maze. &quot;No, I think this message means much more than 
what it says.&quot; 

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Tolaris said as he thought. &quot;What do we know about K&#39;tal?&quot; 

Maze snickered. &quot;He has the two qualities most desired in a Dragoon.&quot; 

Whisper blinked. &quot;And what are those?&quot; she said warily. 

&quot;He&#39;s got brains and he&#39;s got k&#39;vesan,&quot; Maze replied with a grin. 

&quot;Men,&quot; Whisper sighed and traded only partially-amused looks with 
Ra&#39;vel. The avian made a distasteful chirping noise and glared at 
Maze. 

Maze chuckled and shook his head. &quot;Oh, please. I saw how you handled 
yourself in the Outreaches. You&#39;ve got more k&#39;vesan than some guys I 
know.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel blinked in mild surprise and looked at Whisper. The telepath 
merely shrugged and cinched her towel a little tighter. &quot;I think he 
does have a point, Ra&#39;vel.&quot; 

&quot;Now that we have established that Ra&#39;vel has what it takes to be part 
of the Dragoons despite being female, we need to figure this out,&quot; 
Tolaris said mildly. &quot;Something is definitely going on here and we 
need to know as soon as possible. Suggestions?&quot; 

&quot;Send a reply back,&quot; Whisper said. &quot;Something tells me he wants to 
make absolutely certain that it&#39;s us on this end before he does 
something.&quot; 

&quot;Question is, do we really know what he&#39;s going to do?&quot; Maze 
countered. &quot;We don&#39;t even know if that is K&#39;tal on the other end.&quot; 

Whisper nodded. &quot;That is true, but keep in mind that they already know 
we&#39;re here. I&#39;m not sure what sort of plan K&#39;tal has in mind, but I 
don&#39;t think that a Dragoon would do anything like this unless he had a 
good reason.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;That makes sense. I&#39;m for sending a reply back. Any 
objections?&quot; Both Maze and Ra&#39;vel shook their heads and Tolaris 
nodded. &quot;Very well, then, here goes nothing.&quot; 

Everyone remained silent as Tolaris typed up a quick anonymous reply 
and sent it back to the Dragoon Headquarters Complex. A tiny beep 
signaled the receipt of the message at the distant end and Tolaris sat 
back. &quot;Well, then. So now we wait.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t suppose I have a few minutes to go get dressed?&quot; Whisper said 
mildly as she ran her fingers through her still-dripping hair. 

Tolaris saw Maze biting his tongue out of the corner of his eye and he 
sighed quietly. &quot;By all means, Captain.&quot; 

Whisper nodded and was preparing to teleport back to her room when the 
computer beeped again, signaling another incoming message. &quot;That was 
fast,&quot; she said slowly. 

Tolaris frowned. &quot;Too fast,&quot; he said as he opened the message. 

FM: SYSADMIN, DHQCX (314.485.117.501)

RE: RE-XT ACK

Maze sat up with a scowl. &quot;Why does he need to know who we are?&quot; 

Tolaris&#39;s mind was working as fast as it was capable. &quot;Maze, wait a 
moment.... Standard operating procedure is to get a positive ID of the 
user on other end before performing a network alt-route. Using a 
secure frequency is not uncommon. However, the frequency he suggested 
doesn&#39;t exist.&quot; 

Whisper frowned and leaned forward to get a better look at the screen, 
cinching the towel a little tighter as she did so. &quot;It looks like a 
valid frequency to me. Maze, if you don&#39;t find something else to look 
at other than my chest, I will tear your eyeballs out,&quot; she said 
evenly. 

Maze coughed discreetly and focused his attention on the crystal 
computer screen. &quot;She&#39;s got a point, boss. I don&#39;t see why that 
frequency wouldn&#39;t exist.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s one of those division-level Commander&#39;s-Eyes-Only secrets,&quot; 
Tolaris replied. &quot;No message traffic is ever transmitted with a 
middle-band frequency of C. It&#39;s one of those little designations that 
means someone is trying to tell us something but can&#39;t do it on any 
sort of free-range medium.&quot; 

Whisper blinked. &quot;Why is it they never told me that?&quot; 

Tolaris turned his head to one side to look at her. &quot;Did you ever 
receive a formal in-brief when you got promoted to Captain of the 
Psi-Corp?&quot; 

The telepath wrinkled her nose at the thought. &quot;No, I didn&#39;t.&quot; 

&quot;Trust me, it would have been in there,&quot; the Dragoon commander replied 
as he turned back to the monitor. &quot;Now if we can only figure out what 
exactly he&#39;s trying to tell us.&quot; Ra&#39;vel chirped a query and his head 
snapped around to look at her, only to wind up mashing his face 
against Whisper&#39;s chest. 

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Whisper said icily as she took a step back and tightened 
the towel around her. 

Tolaris&#39;s face flushed a dark shade of gray. &quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; he said 
sheepishly. He blinked and focused his attention on Ra&#39;vel. &quot;Say that 
just a little slower, Ra&#39;vel.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel gave him a curious look and repeated her chirps slower. Tolaris 
sat back to consider the thought for a moment while Maze gave Ra&#39;vel 
an odd look. &quot;What exactly did you say? My language skills aren&#39;t what 
they used to be....&quot; he apologized. 

&lt;Acronym for commander Dragoon divison&gt; she telepathed to the room. 

Whisper&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;DCT. Dragoon Commander Tolaris.&quot; 

Both Maze and Tolaris frowned as they turned to give her an odd look. 
&quot;What exactly are you saying?&quot; Tolaris inquired. 

Whisper shook her head, sending more water droplets flying around. 
&quot;Don&#39;t you see? We know he&#39;s trying to reach you, but he can&#39;t or 
won&#39;t come out and say who he&#39;s trying to reach. He needs to make 
absolutely sure it&#39;s you he&#39;s got before he switches you over to 
another network.&quot; 

Tolaris thought about the idea for a full second before he turned back 
to the keyboard and started typing as fast as he could. 

FM: 284.336.84.502

RE: ALT-ROUTE ACK 

TX: THISTA RECONF RCV&#39;D MSG RE ALT-ROUTE BREAK ID CONF STERLING LTCDR 

SEC DIV IDENT 21354SCD BREAK THISTA AT SB FOR ALT-ROUTE BREAK END 

Maze waited until the computer beeped softly before he shook his head. 
&quot;Congratulations, boss, you just totally confused me. I understood the 
part about reconfirming the network alt-route, and I understood the 
part about standing by for the switch, but who exactly did you say you 
were?&quot; 

Tolaris looked up at his friend and smiled. &quot;My great-grandfather.&quot; 

Whisper blinked. &quot;Your great-grandfather?&quot; she echoed. 

Tolaris merely shrugged. &quot;Well, think about it. If he can&#39;t ask for me 
by name for some reason, what makes you think it&#39;s safe for me to 
reply with mine? He knows who my great-grandfather was, or at least he 
should,&quot; he added with a small sigh. 

&quot;So now what do we do, boss?&quot; Maze asked as he gave Ra&#39;vel a curious 
look. 

&quot;So now we wait for the network to switch over,&quot; Tolaris replied. 

Ra&#39;vel chirped at Maze curiously and he squinted at her. &quot;I could be 
wrong, Ra&#39;vel, but I think that might be a dust mite on your 
shoulder,&quot; he said slowly. Ra&#39;vel screeched and immediately started 
fluffing her feathers, sending a tiny cloud of feather particles into 
the air. 

Whisper took a hasty step back, but not before she accidentally 
inhaled some of the particles. Her nose twitched briefly for a moment 
before she let loose with a loud sneeze. Her eyes suddenly doubled in 
size as she felt the towel unwrap itself from her body and fall to the 
floor. 

Some people may have considered Ra&#39;vel to be somewhat slow-minded 
because of the brain damage she received during the Mintaka campaign. 
However true that may be, she certainly wasn&#39;t stupid. She heard 
Whisper sneeze behind her and realized the probable result. With what 
some might have called an avian version of a grin, she extended her 
wings out as far as they could, effectively blocking Maze&#39;s line of 
sight. 

&quot;I will be right back,&quot; Whisper said quickly, blushing a dark shade of 
blue. She scooped up her towel and teleported out of the room, leaving 
a small spray of water in her wake. 

&quot;Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris said evenly, fixing Maze with a reproving look. 

&quot;What&#39;d I do?&quot; Maze replied, his tan eyes wide with innocence. 

Tolaris just sighed heavily and looked over at Ra&#39;vel, who was 
occupied with preening her feathers for dust mites. &quot;I&#39;m sure Captain 
Whisper is very appreciative of your excellent timing, Ra&#39;vel,&quot; 
Tolaris told her. 

Ra&#39;vel looked up from her work long enough to scold Maze for a few 
moments before she returned to her task, making quiet, distasteful 
chirping noises to herself as she worked. 

Everyone blinked and looked up at the computer as it made a harsh 
noise and flashed a &quot;Network Failure&quot; warning. The message continued 
to flash on the screen for a few seconds before being replaced with an 
&quot;Establishing Connection to Distant End&quot; message. 

&quot;This should be interesting,&quot; Maze commented as they watched the 
computer go through the motions of connecting to another site through 
the dimensional phase-link. Ra&#39;vel chirped an agreement and resumed 
her task, her attention divided between the monitor and her feathers. 

&quot;I think Maze was making a joke about the dust mites,&quot; Tolaris told 
her. 

&quot;Umm, no I wasn&#39;t....&quot; Maze said with a frown. 

Ra&#39;vel paused her work to look up at them, her gaze alternating 
between the two of them. She was about to chirp something at them when 
she caught motion out of the corner of her eye. She turned to look and 
started screeching almost in the ultra-sound range, causing Tolaris 
and Maze to wince in pain at the high frequency. 

Tolaris watched with mild interest as Ra&#39;vel snapped her beak at 
something on her feathers, chomped down hard and quickly spat it out, 
and then proceed to stomp on it, her talons scratching up the floor 
tiles in the process. 

&quot;She hates dust mites with a passion,&quot; Maze observed with a smile. 

&quot;So I see. I think you got it, Lieutenant, so you can stop clawing up 
the floor now,&quot; Tolaris called out to her. 

Ra&#39;vel hissed at the now-deceased dust mite and gave it one final 
stomp before she fluffed her feathers and calmed down, chirping 
apologetically at the other Dragoons. 

&quot;We understand,&quot; Maze said soothingly. 

The avian grumbled to herself for a moment before she resumed preening 
her feathers, pausing long enough to take one step to the side. The 
air shimmered briefly as Whisper teleported back into the room, 
wearing a snug-fitting tank top and sweatpants. &quot;Hold still,&quot; she 
growled at Maze as she walked over to him and grabbed his nose. 

&quot;Euungh..?&quot; Maze grunted before his gaze went vaccant and he fell 
silent. 

Tolaris&#39;s eyebrow went up almost to his hairline as he watched Whisper 
scan Maze&#39;s mind for something. He exchanged a mild glance with Ra&#39;vel 
and got a casual shrug in response. Okay.... he thought before he 
returned his attention back to Whisper and Maze. 

Whisper sighed and released her hold on Maze&#39;s nose. The Dragoon 
blinked and leaned forward, his nose twitching briefly before he let 
loose with a very forceful sneeze. His hands immediately came up to 
his face and his eyes took on a slightly disgusted expression. 

&quot;Ewww....&quot; he groaned. 

&quot;Tissues are in the bathroom,&quot; Whisper said mildly. 

&quot;Danks,&quot; Maze replied as he stood up and made a hasty exit. 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;Do I want to ask...?&quot; 

The telepath made a face. &quot;I just wanted to see if he did that on 
purpose or not. He didn&#39;t, which is why he&#39;s still breathing,&quot; she 
added. Ra&#39;vel chirped something at her and she nodded in reply. &quot;Yes, 
I am very grateful for your wingspan, Lieutenant. Oh, and if you 
remind me tomorrow, I&#39;ll help you try to set up some sort of oil bath 
to get rid of those mites.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chittered back a reply that Whisper wasn&#39;t able to translate. 
She blinked in confusion and gave Tolaris a blank look. &quot;Did she say 
something about soap in her last oil bath?&quot; she asked hesitantly. 

The Dragoon commander just shook his head. &quot;You don&#39;t want to know.&quot; 

&quot;About what?&quot; Maze asked as he walked back in the room, still wiping 
at his nose with a tissue. 

&quot;About that little incident where someone &#39;accidentally&#39; dumped a full 
jar of concentrated liquid soap into her oil bath last year,&quot; Tolaris 
said mildly. 

Maze flushed a dark green and fought to keep his tone level. &quot;Yeah, I 
heard about that. Soap isn&#39;t good for your feathers, is it?&quot; he asked. 

Ra&#39;vel&#39;s rather profane reply was cut off by the sound of the computer 
beeping as it received a message from its new network host. Everyone 
exchanged mild glances and gathered around the terminal before Tolaris 
opened up the message. 

FM: SYSADMIN, DHQCX (314.485.117.501)

&quot;Now what?&quot; Whisper muttered. 

&quot;Apparently he wants us to establish a secure connection,&quot; Tolaris 
said. &quot;The only problem is, we don&#39;t have that keytape.&quot; 

Maze frowned. &quot;Is that a good tape? I mean, it&#39;s not another one of 
your little commander&#39;s-only games, it it?&quot; 

Tolaris sat back to consider the matter. &quot;No, that is a valid keytape 
to the best of my knowledge.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel snapped her beak quietly several times before she blinked as an 
idea occurred to her. &lt;What if keytape not, is key?&gt; she telepathed. 

Whisper frowned. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

Tolaris blinked and looked up. &quot;Ra&#39;vel, did you telepath something?&quot; 
he asked, once again mentally cursing the fact that he was psi-mute. 

Maze straightened up so fast he almost strained something. &quot;Boss, 
she&#39;s right! What if that&#39;s not a keytape name, but the actual 
encryption key?&quot; 

Whisper blinked and gave Maze an odd look. &quot;Do you think that someone 
like K&#39;tal would send the key over the open like that, even disguised 
as the name of a keytape?&quot; 

&quot;Remember what I said about him being just a little too gung-ho?&quot; 
Tolaris replied as he typed a response back. &quot;Trust me, this is 
exactly the sort of gutsy stunt I&#39;d expect him to pull.&quot; 

&quot;Too much k&#39;vesan and not enough brains, eh?&quot; Whisper said wryly. 

&quot;You can never have too much k&#39;vesan,&quot; Maze said with a grin. 

&quot;Men,&quot; Whisper sighed as she shook her head. &quot;So we&#39;re sure that it&#39;s 
K&#39;tal on the other end?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m staking our lives on it by replying, Captain,&quot; Tolaris 
replied evenly. &quot;I&#39;d rather go down trusting another Dragoon than 
anyone else.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped her agreement while Maze nodded. &quot;We&#39;re with you on 
that one, boss,&quot; he said. 

Tolaris merely grunted in reply and waited for the distant end to 
respond. He blinked in surprise when the computer made a peculiar 
humming noise and a text box appeared on the screen. &quot;Entering Secure 
Mode, Please Stand By,&quot; he read aloud, sitting back and waiting. 

&quot;So now what?&quot; Whisper asked, already knowing the answer. 

&quot;So now we....&quot; He trailed off as the screen was suddenly filled with 
lines of seemingly random characters. &quot;This is interesting....&quot; 

Maze blinked. &quot;Is someone doing a data dump?&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps, perhaps not,&quot; Tolaris said as he waited for the text block 
to finish displaying itself. &quot;I may not be an expert on 
communications, but this looks like an encrypted data file.&quot; 

&quot;Well, well, well....&quot; Whisper said slowly. &quot;Anyone want to bet on 
what we&#39;ll get if we run that through a decryption program with the 
character string Commander K&#39;tal just gave us?&quot; 

&quot;One way to find out,&quot; Maze said as he rose from his seat. 

Tolaris gave him an odd look. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; 

&quot;I was going to go ask Ami if we could borrow her toy computer. I&#39;ve 
seen what kind of processing power it has and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll zip right 
through this thing in no time,&quot; he explained. 

&quot;Sit down, Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris said as he split the display in half 
and opened another program in the second window. &quot;She and the others 
are busy studying right now. It&#39;s bad enough that their lives have 
been disrupted by being Sailor Scouts as it is. We don&#39;t need to be 
adding to the chaos by having them assist us with things like this 
when they&#39;re trying to learn how to function as adults in their own 
society.&quot; 

Maze sat down with a small grunt. &quot;I guess I see your point, boss.&quot; 

&quot;How long will this take?&quot; Whisper asked. &quot;I really need to finish up 
my shower before dinner.&quot; 

Tolaris and Maze exchanged glances and Maze smiled. &quot;I&#39;m going to have 
to code this decryption program from scratch, so it should take at 
least an hour. I&#39;ll have someone knock on your door when we&#39;re 
finished,&quot; Tolaris said as he typed away at a furious pace. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Whisper replied and prepared to teleport back to her 
room. 

&quot;One thing before you go, ma&#39;am,&quot; Maze said, still smiling. 

The telepath paused and gave Maze a wary look. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;You really ought to dry off before wearing something form-fitting 
like that tank top,&quot; he said evenly. &quot;Water tends to collect in the 
strangest of places.&quot; 

Whisper blinked and glanced down, her face turning a dark shade of 
blue when she realized that the water had turned the front of her tank 
top totally transparent. &quot;Men,&quot; she grumbled as she hastily teleported 
out of the room. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Maze walked into the computer room carrying two steaming mugs of 
ma&#39;cha, the denizen version of coffee. &quot;So what&#39;s it look like?&quot; he 
asked Tolaris as he held out a mug. 

Tolaris grunted as he accepted the mug and set it on the edge of the 
work station, never taking his eyes off of the computer display. &quot;I 
finished that decryption program five minutes ago. That data file we 
got isn&#39;t just any data file, its another encryption key,&quot; he said 
grumpily. 

Maze paused, the mug halfway to his lips. &quot;Another encryption key?&quot; he 
echoed. 

Tolaris nodded, his attention still fixed on the computer. &quot;Yes. The 
thing with this key is it&#39;s an actual copy of a keytape. All we would 
need to do is load it into a crypto-linker and we could establish a 
secure link to the other end of this network.&quot; 

&quot;Great!&quot; Maze exclaimed. 

&quot;Problem,&quot; Tolaris countered. 

The Dragoon sat back and pondered the matter for a moment. &quot;What sort 
of problem?&quot; he finally asked warily. 

&quot;Do you see a crypto-linker anywhere around here?&quot; Tolaris replied 
with a heavy sigh. 

Maze blinked. &quot;Sure, there&#39;s one in the arsenal vault.&quot; 

&quot;You mean the one you fed to Dyvach so it could fabricate the parts 
you needed to rewire Mina&#39;s coffepot into an instant hot chocolate 
machine?&quot; Tolaris replied. 

&quot;D&#39;oh....&quot; Maze muttered as he slapped himself on the forehead. 

The Dragoon commander sat back and gave his friend a strange look. 
&quot;What exactly is that you just said?&quot; he asked curiously. 

&quot;Sorry, I guess I sort of got that from watching too much of that 
animated whatever Mina keeps watching,&quot; Maze explained sheepishly. &quot;I 
think this Earth culture is starting to get to me.&quot; 

&quot;Is that a good thing or a bad thing?&quot; 

Maze frowned as he took a sip of his ma&#39;cha. &quot;I&#39;m not sure anymore, 
boss. I mean, at first living here was a great idea. We got away from 
all of the backstabbing and politics from working in the Negaverse, 
not to mention being away from all those wonderful animals and such we 
have running around. But now that I&#39;ve been here for awhile....&quot; 

Tolaris took a calculated sip of his own mug as Maze trailed off. 
&quot;Keep going, Lieutenant. It&#39;s not like anyone is going to court 
martial you for your opinions about your exile.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s just it, boss,&quot; Maze said suddenly with a grunt. &quot;Right now, 
it&#39;s starting to feel like we&#39;re in exile. I mean, I know I don&#39;t have 
anyone back in the Negaverse that I could see even if I wanted to, but 
every now and then I feel like just taking a walk down some city 
street and enjoying a sense of familiarity and belonging.&quot; He blew out 
his breath in frustration and took a large gulp of the ma&#39;cha, 
ignoring the pain as it scalded his throat. 

&quot;You&#39;re bored, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Tolaris asked softly. 

Maze sighed and looked into his mug, watching the odd patterns the 
rising steam made. &quot;Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; he said after a 
moment. &quot;I mean, at least when I was in the Negaverse I had my job to 
keep me mostly occupied.&quot; 

&quot;Not to mention having a seemingly endless supply of female company to 
help occupy you when you weren&#39;t working,&quot; Tolaris said with a grin. 

Maze snorted. &quot;Admit it, you were always jealous of that.&quot; 

&quot;If you say so,&quot; Tolaris snickered. 

Maze gave his friend an odd look. &quot;Come on, boss, you mean to tell me 
that you never had the desire for female company at least some time 
during your seven-hundred-plus years of life in the Negaverse?&quot; 

Tolaris&#39;s eyebrow arched up in mild amusement. &quot;You know very well 
that I have, Maze. However, I was always too busy to accomodate.&quot; 

&quot;Of course,&quot; Maze muttered darkly as he sipped his ma&#39;cha. &quot;So you&#39;re 
saying that you couldn&#39;t forget that never-ending stack of reports for 
at least one night to just sit back in your quarters and relax with 
someone?&quot; 

&quot;What, with Queen Beryl&#39;s wrath looming over my head if those reports 
were ever improperly handled or were late being filed?&quot; Tolaris 
countered. 

Maze blinked. &quot;What kind of reports were those?&quot; 

&quot;Classified Seven-Aerce,&quot; the Dragoon replied. 

&quot;Straight to Beryl?&quot; Maze asked with a sickened expression. He 
received a nod in reply and he shivered. &quot;Eww.... No wonder you were 
so anti-social. You honestly and truly didn&#39;t have the time, did you?&quot; 

&quot;So nice to be believed after all these decades,&quot; Tolaris replied 
wryly. 

Maze made a distasteful face. &quot;Oh, hush. Why didn&#39;t you ever put in 
for a short field assignment or a request to take some leave?&quot; 

&quot;Several reasons,&quot; Tolaris replied as he sat back. &quot;First, I was the 
only officer in the Dragoon ranks who was cleared for that stuff. 
Second, those reports were rather vital to Queen Beryl&#39;s operational 
plans. Third, even if I did manage to get an assignment, the 
responsibility for those reports would have fallen to Shar-Tei, and I 
wouldn&#39;t want to have that dumped on anyone. And the final reason, 
Maze, is that I simply didn&#39;t feel like it,&quot; he finished with a sip of 
his ma&#39;cha. 

Maze just sighed heavily and looked at the ceiling. &quot;You know, I 
wonder if Captain Raijen founded the Dragoon Legion as a means of 
uniting the most loyal or the most work-hard-until-you-drop type of 
soldiers. You sure seem to fit the second category.&quot; 

The Dragoon commander grunted in mild amusement. &quot;Probably both.&quot; 

&quot;Figures,&quot; Maze agreed. 

Tolaris nodded and looked at the computer warily. &quot;We need to get back 
to our original problem.&quot; 

&quot;What, the crypto-linker?&quot; Maze asked. He received a nod in reply and 
he sat back to think, idly sipping at his nearly-empty mug. &quot;The only 
real vital component is the actual encryption modulator. Everything 
else can be rigged up or patched from scratch. Do you think Dyvach 
could reconstruct a modulator if we feed it enough raw material?&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged as he tossed back the last mouthful of ma&#39;cha and 
stood up. &quot;I have no idea, Maze, but Dyavch might know. So why not ask 
it?&quot; he said as he set the empty mug on the table and started walking 
towards the door. He only managed to take three steps past it before 
he accidentally tripped over the large crystalline spider curled up in 
the middle of the hallway. 

The Dragoon grunted as he got to his feet. &quot;Must you take a nap in the 
middle of the hallway?&quot; he grumbled at the weaver. 

Dyvach made a disoriented chiming sound before it started flexing its 
many crystalline legs, sounding like a tangled set of wind chimes. 
It&#39;s usually transparent carapace was flushed a dark orange color as 
it struggled to cope with the sudden shock of being tripped over while 
napping. It continued to stretch for a few moments before it chimed a 
still mildly disoriented query at the Dragoon. 

&quot;Of course I&#39;m fine,&quot; Tolaris replied as he leaned against the wall 
for a moment. &quot;Trust me, if I can get run over by Ami and not damage 
anything, then I&#39;m sure tripping over you won&#39;t hurt too badly. Are 
you awake yet?&quot; 

Dyvach&#39;s color returned to normal as it chimed back an affirmative. It 
stood up and continued stretching its many legs one by one, making 
soft chiming sounds to itself in the process. 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Good. I&#39;ve got a question for you. Do you remember 
that crypto-linker you ate awhile back?&quot; He received a rather happy 
chime in response and he smirked. &quot;Tasted that good, eh?&quot; 

Dyvach immediately cut loose with a stream of chittering noises that 
Tolaris wasn&#39;t quite able to translate properly. The Dragoon sighed 
quietly and rubbed at his temples. &quot;Slow down, Dyvach, you know I 
can&#39;t always make out what you say, even on a good day. You said 
something about the modulator?&quot; 

The weaver chimed back a brief explanation that caused Tolaris to 
blink in mild surprise. &quot;Mina&#39;s using it for what?&quot; Tolaris asked. 
Dyvach tried to explain in greater detail but Tolaris wasn&#39;t able to 
fully understand what it was trying to say. 

Maze poked his head out of the room at the mention of Mina&#39;s name. &quot;So 
what&#39;s up?&quot; he asked, slightly curious as to what Mina had to do with 
the current situation. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;From what I understand, Mina&#39;s got the modulator 
for some sort of project.&quot; 

&quot;Great,&quot; Maze grunted. &quot;Knowing her, she&#39;s probably got it wired into 
that demonstrosity she calls her synthesizer. Which also means she&#39;s 
not going to be too happy about having to give it up.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m afraid she&#39;ll have to do without it for the time being,&quot; Tolaris 
said with another shrug. &quot;She can have it back when we&#39;re finished 
with it, but I think this takes priority over it&#39;s entertainment 
value.&quot; 

Maze snickered. &quot;Just try getting her to see that.&quot; 

Tolaris gave his lieutenant a decidedly evil grin. &quot;That&#39;s your job.&quot; 

Maze blinked and immediately quit snickering. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;You said you were bored, right?&quot; Tolaris said mildly. 

&quot;I said I was bored, not suicidal,&quot; Maze countered. &quot;You know how she 
is about her synthesizer.&quot; 

&quot;Come now, surely your unnatural charm can win her over,&quot; Tolaris 
teased. He laughed as Maze started muttering highly acidic comments to 
himself about blondes and electronics. 

&quot;Times like this makes me wish I was single,&quot; Maze muttered as he 
started walking towards the room where Mina and the others were still 
studying. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

General Rune looked up in irritation as someone knocked on the door to 
her private bathroom. &quot;Who is it?&quot; she called out, letting her 
irritation show in her voice. 

&quot;Moirah,&quot; came the voice from the other side of the door. 

Rune grumbled to herself and sat up, trying to decide what sort of 
crisis was happening now. She was still mildly upset at the intrusion, 
but she knew that Moirah had enough personal experience in dealing 
with her to know when and when not to disturb her while she was taking 
a bath. 

&quot;Come in,&quot; she grunted as she picked up a washcloth and began to rinse 
the soap off of her skin. She heard an odd liquid sound and looked up 
as a puddle of water started flooding the room from the crack under 
the door. Rune watched with mild curiosity as the puddle started to 
rise up and solidify into a humanoid shape. 

&quot;A little theatrical today, are we?&quot; Rune said mildly when the 
aquamorph had assumed her normal, solid form. 

&quot;Begging the general&#39;s pardon, I didn&#39;t think you wanted me opening 
the door given your current state of undress,&quot; Moirah said evenly as 
her eyes reflexively scanned the room for any possible sign of danger. 

Rune snorted. &quot;I gave up on modesty after the first month of having 
you and V&#39;Kreeth taking turns watching over me while I bathe.&quot; She 
looked up and caught the aquamorph&#39;s glance towards the tiny pocket of 
shadows in the distant corner of the bathroom. &quot;So what sort of crisis 
do we have today?&quot; Rune asked after a careful moment of observation. 

&quot;Sensors report a massive energy disturbance coming from the 
dimensional rift in the Hinterland region. The current analysis of the 
disruption is inconclusive, but Science thinks it might be an 
artificial rift in the process of opening,&quot; Moirah reported. 

Rune paused in mid-motion as her bodyguard&#39;s words sank in. &quot;From the 
Hinterland region, you said?&quot; she asked slowly as she gave Moirah a 
carefully neutral look. 

&quot;Yes, General,&quot; Moirah replied. 

Rune sighed and sank back down into the bathtub, letting the steaming 
water flow over her body. &quot;Tell me, V&#39;Kreeth, what do you think is 
going on in that region?&quot; she asked the shadowy corner. 

The shadow detatched itself from the wall and moved foward to stand 
next to Moirah, appearing only to be a pair of dark gray eyes set into 
a humanoid mass of darkness. 

&quot;The best guess is that Nop&#39;tera is about to make her return,&quot; 
V&#39;Kreeth said in a voice that sounded like dry leaves whispering over 
stone. 

&quot;Which is what I would conclude,&quot; Rune said with a heavy sigh. &quot;Time 
has a way of sneaking up on you, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; 

&quot;It all depends on your perspective,&quot; V&#39;Kreeth replied. 

Rune said nothing as she resumed running the washcloth over her body. 
&quot;Do you have anything else to report while you&#39;re here, Moirah?&quot; she 
asked somewhat wearily. 

&quot;We received a Flash message from Leviathan North an hour ago saying 
they might have a possible submerged contact,&quot; the aquamorph replied. 
&quot;They only detected it because they almost collided with it. The 
contact does not appear on their sonar and they are currently trying 
to locate it by audio tracking. They do not believe they were detected 
during the incident and immediately assumed a Stage 4 alert.&quot; 

Rune sat up so quickly that she splashed a considerable amount of 
water onto the floor. &quot;A submerged contact?&quot; she repeated with a 
frown. She thought about the matter for a few moments before she made 
a decision. &quot;Send a Flash to both Leviathan North and Leviathan South. 
Tell them to immediately assume a Stage 3 alert with the instructions 
to go to Stage 2 upon a solid contact with any submerged vessel. If 
the contact shows any hostile intent at all, they have full 
sub-surface weapons release authority.&quot; She blinked as someone started 
knocking on the door. &quot;Now what?&quot; she grumbled to herself. &quot;Who is 
it?&quot; she called out. 

&quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren,&quot; came the dulcet voice from the other side of the 
door. 

&quot;One question, V&#39;Kreeth,&quot; Rune said quickly. &quot;Did Queen Beryl ever 
have to hold a conference while she was in the bathtub?&quot; 

&quot;The shower, yes, but I don&#39;t recall one from the bathtub,&quot; V&#39;Kreeth 
said in all seriousness. 

&quot;Let her in,&quot; Rune said as she sank back down into the water. 

Moirah blinked. &quot;Begging the general&#39;s pardon....&quot; 

&quot;If you are concerned about my modesty, Moirah, there isn&#39;t anything I 
have that she doesn&#39;t,&quot; Rune said with a slight edge to her voice. 

Moirah traded mild looks with V&#39;Kreeth before she went to the door and 
opened it, quickly closing it after Si&#39;ren entered. V&#39;Kreeth quickly 
retreated back into the corner of shadows while Moirah tried to remain 
as unobtrusive as possible under the circumstances. 

Admiral Si&#39;ren glanced over Rune&#39;s nude body and blinked, her delicate 
eyebrows almost arched up to her hairline. &quot;If I had known we&#39;d be 
doing one of these kinds of meetings, I&#39;d have brought a swimsuit,&quot; 
she said mildly. 

Rune sighed. Si&#39;ren was the Negaverse Navy&#39;s Fleet Admiral, which 
under ordinary circumstances made her the equal to the Army&#39;s 
Commander General. However, with the absence of a monarch, the power 
of the throne went to the Commander General. This technically made 
Rune Si&#39;ren&#39;s superior, but the admiral often still viewed them as 
equals. 

&quot;And how many of &#39;these kind&#39; of meetings have you been to?&quot; Rune 
asked. 

Si&#39;ren gave her a strange little smile. &quot;Queen Beryl had the worst 
luck when it came to developing crises. They always seemed to happen 
while she was in the shower.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll bet that made the other generals happy,&quot; Rune replied evenly. 

&quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t think anyone cared,&quot; Si&#39;ren said with a casual 
shrug. &quot;Malachite was only interested in Zoicite, Nephlyte never 
considered Beryl to be attractive, and neither Zoicite nor Al&#39;vexi 
were attracted to other women.&quot; 

&quot;And what of Jedyt?&quot; Rune asked with mild curiosity. 

Si&#39;ren made a face. &quot;I don&#39;t think Beryl had to have a meeting like 
that since Jedyt was promoted to the rank of general. Or if she did, I 
wasn&#39;t able to attend for some reason or another.&quot; 

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Rune said mildly. &quot;So what brings you here at this 
hour?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren smiled at her again. &quot;What, I can&#39;t be sociable anymore?&quot; 

Rune frowned. &quot;If you are trying to be sociable, Si&#39;ren, then you 
picked a really bad time. Unless you wanted to see me naked in the 
bathtub,&quot; she added in a neutral tone. 

Si&#39;ren blinked, her eyebrows arching up again. &quot;I have just received a 
Flash message from Leviathan South about a possible submerged contact 
almost running them over....&quot; She blinked again as Rune sat up again, 
splashing even more water onto the floor. 

&quot;Moirah, get that message out now!&quot; Rune snapped. &quot;Tell them both that 
I want hourly reports on anything they find, no matter how 
insignificant.&quot; 

Moirah didn&#39;t bother taking the time to reply. She immediately became 
a column of liquid that splashed to the floor in a large puddle, 
quickly oozing out the crack beneath the door. 

Si&#39;ren watched the whole process with mild amusement. &quot;It must be nice 
to be able to do that,&quot; she observed. 

&quot;It depends on the situation,&quot; Rune said. &quot;Having a bodyguard that can 
hide in the fountain in my private chambers is a definite advantage, 
but you have no idea how many times I&#39;ve had to chase her out of my 
bath. She claims she can protect me better if she&#39;s right there with 
me,&quot; Rune explained. 

Si&#39;ren erupted into peals of laughter, much to Rune&#39;s irritation. &quot;You 
should have listened to Beryl go on about having to put up with 
bodyguards in her bedroom. She didn&#39;t mind their presence while she 
slept, but she sort of had a thing against being watched while, shall 
we say, entertaining a private guest,&quot; the admiral explained, giving 
Rune a knowing look. 

Rune gave her a neutral look before she glanced over at the corner of 
the bathroom. &quot;V&#39;Kreeth....&quot; she started to say. 

&quot;We can leave you alone provided you are by yourself, General, but we 
cannot leave you alone with someone else, even if you give us a direct 
order to,&quot; V&#39;Kreeth explained almost apologetically. &quot;What goes on 
during that time is nobody&#39;s business and is never spoken of.&quot; 

&quot;Am I not allowed any privacy any more?&quot; Rune muttered. 

&quot;Privacy is what you make of it,&quot; Si&#39;ren said with another odd smile. 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Rune replied. &quot;Now unless you have any other business that 
needs to be addressed at this moment, I would like to try to finish my 
bath in some semblance of privacy.&quot; 

&quot;Of course,&quot; Si&#39;ren said smoothly. &quot;Perhaps we can arrange to have 
another one of these meetings at a later date when we don&#39;t have any 
other crises to worry about. Pleasant evening, General Rune,&quot; she said 
with a small bow and left the room, quietly closing the door behind 
her. 

Rune sat in the bathtub with a slightly puzzled look on her face. She 
remained that way for several minutes, trying to figure out a new 
puzzle that life had just handed to her. &quot;V&#39;Kreeth....&quot; she said 
slowly. 

&quot;It is not for me to say,&quot; the shadow replied. 

Rune frowned lightly. &quot;I see. What would you suggest I do, then?&quot; 

&quot;Again, it is not for me to say,&quot; came the voice from the shadowy 
corner. &quot;If the idea appeals to you, then that&#39;s your business. As I 
said before, what goes on in your chambers is nobody&#39;s business and is 
never spoken of.&quot; 

Rune sighed and opened the drain valve, letting the water slowly empty 
out of the bathtub. &quot;Were you there when Beryl had her guests?&quot; She 
received silence in reply and she sighed. &quot;Did Beryl ever have any 
privacy at all?&quot; 

&quot;None,&quot; said the shadow. 

&quot;Why didn&#39;t anyone tell me about that part before I assumed command?&quot; 
she grumbled to herself as she picked up a towel and began drying 
herself off under the ever-watchful eyes of her bodyguard. 

&quot;It would probably spoil our fun,&quot; V&#39;Kreeth replied in a rare moment 
of humor, drawing a dark look from Rune. &quot;We must protect you every 
moment of the day, General Rune, and it&#39;s not an easy task. We need to 
get something out of it.&quot; 

&quot;And what do you get out of watching me take a bath?&quot; Rune inquired. 

&quot;I rarely watch you as I am busy watching everything else,&quot; said the 
voice from the corner of the bathroom. 

Rune paused and gave her bodyguard a mild look. &quot;Honestly, V&#39;Kreeth, 
you expect me to believe that?&quot; She received more silence in reply and 
sighed heavily. &quot;Tell me again why I like my job....&quot; she muttered to 
herself. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Tolaris looked up at the door and sighed quietly as Mina walked in 
with a very unhappy look on her face. &quot;Do I even want to ask?&quot; she 
said with an edge to her voice as she held out a small circuit board. 

&quot;The short version is we need this to create a secure link so we can 
talk to someone in the Negaverse without being detected,&quot; Tolaris 
explained as he took the circuit board and looked it over carefully. 

Mina blinked. &quot;What?&quot; 

Tolaris frowned slightly. &quot;I&#39;ll explain in a moment. What exactly did 
you do to the modulator?&quot; he asked as he tapped a somewhat bulky 
computer chip securely soldered to the board. 

&quot;I set it up so I could use it to multiplex the signals to and from a 
laser array,&quot; Mina explained. &quot;Without that chip, I&#39;d need at least 
another CPU chip if not two just to handle the data traffic between 
the control console and the array.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;This thing has an I/O port?&quot; he asked, lapsing into 
computer technical talk. 

&quot;Of course,&quot; the blonde replied as she leaned toward him. &quot;See, this 
is where it connects to the console, that gets connected to the 
array&#39;s data hub, and this thingy right here gets plugged into the 
console&#39;s power matrix,&quot; she explained as she pointed everything out. 

The Dragoon nodded in understanding. &quot;Okay, here&#39;s what I need to do. 
I need to have a signal come in one end, have the modulator descramble 
it with an encryption key, display the result on the computer, have it 
scramble the data I send back, and have the signal go back out the 
other end.&quot; 

Mina gave him a blank look. &quot;Umm.... that&#39;s Ami&#39;s department, not 
mine. I know how to use computers, even Ami&#39;s to some extent, but all 
that hardware and data processing stuff is way over my head.&quot; 

Tolaris chuckled. &quot;You asked what I wanted it for.&quot; 

&quot;Not what I meant,&quot; she replied as she looked at the computer. &quot;Umm, 
who exactly are you trying to talk to and what are you talking about? 
I don&#39;t mean to be nosy or anything, but I&#39;m kinda worried about 
advertising our presence to General Rune, if you know what I mean.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed quietly. &quot;To be perfectly honest, Mina, I have no idea 
who I&#39;m going to be talking to about what. All this chip would do is 
let me talk to that person without having to worry about someone 
listening in or otherwise tapping into the encrypted link.&quot; 

Mina blinked and gave the crystal computer an odd look. &quot;I&#39;ll be right 
back,&quot; she said and quickly left the room, leaving Tolaris standing 
there with the circuit board in his hands and a mildly confused look 
on his face. She returned a few minutes later with a somewhat upset 
vampire following her, highly irritated at having her studies 
interrupted without any warning. 

&quot;This had better be good,&quot; Ami said. 

&quot;Tell her what you told me,&quot; Mina said without any preamble. 

Tolaris blinked for a moment before he took a deep breath and 
explained to Ami everything he had explained to Mina earlier about 
needing the chip and how he was going to use it. 

Ami gave him a reproving look. &quot;Surely you&#39;re capable of performing 
the installation and everything yourself.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;I am.&quot; 

Ami sighed and glared at him. &quot;So why did you have to bother me?&quot; 

Mina tapped her on the shoulder. &quot;Hello, Ami? You&#39;re missing a rather 
serious point here.&quot; 

Ami looked at her. &quot;And that point is...?&quot; 

&quot;Who&#39;s on the other end?&quot; Mina said slowly. 

Ami blinked at the realization sank in. &quot;Umm.... good question....&quot; 

&quot;We think it&#39;s the new Dragoon commander, but we can&#39;t be absolutely 
certain,&quot; Tolaris explained before Ami could ask. 

&quot;Who&#39;s we?&quot; Mina asked. 

&quot;The rest of us denizens who live here,&quot; Maze replied as he walked 
into the room. A somewhat lengthy scratch on the back of his hand was 
still slowly oozing his green blood, a sight which slightly unsettled 
Ami. 

Tolaris raised an eyebrow. &quot;What happened to you?&quot; 

&quot;I think Mina leaves sharp edges in odd places inside her synthesizer 
to keep anyone who doesn&#39;t know better from removing anything,&quot; he 
said dourly. 

&quot;I told you that I would get to it in a few minutes,&quot; Mina replied. 
&quot;It&#39;s not my fault you got impatient and tried to remove it yourself.&quot; 

&quot;But was I right about the sharp edges?&quot; he asked pointedly. 

The blonde snorted. &quot;Would I do a thing like that?&quot; 

&quot;Yes,&quot; chorused Maze and Ami. 

Mina gave Ami a dark look. &quot;You stay out of this,&quot; she said archly. 

Tolaris cleared his throat. &quot;Can we get this taken care of before you 
decide to further injure my lieutenant?&quot; 

&quot;Why don&#39;t we start from the beginning,&quot; Ami suggested. &quot;What prompted 
you to suddenly start wanting to talk to someone in the Negaverse?&quot; 

Tolaris nodded and turned to the computer. &quot;It all started when we got 
a message like this,&quot; he explained and began to show them the contents 
of the network administration messages he had received. 

&quot;Wait, don&#39;t translate for us,&quot; Ami said quickly as the spidery 
symbols that made up the written denizen language began to scroll up 
on the crystal monitor screen. &quot;Time to see if our language skills are 
up to par.&quot; 

Tolaris and Maze exchanged glances before Maze shrugged. &quot;Okay....&quot; 
the Dragoon commander said slowly as he sat back. &quot;Just let me know if 
you need help or when you&#39;re ready to see the next one.&quot; 

&quot;Sure....&quot; Mina replied absently, her mind already focused on trying 
to translate. &quot;Umm, is this supposed to mean &#39;distant&#39; or am I 
misreading it?&quot; she asked as she pointed to a symbol. 

&quot;Keep in mind that the military mindset is the same, no matter what 
world you&#39;re from,&quot; Ami said as she squinted at a different symbol. 
&quot;It probably means the same, only it&#39;s been abbreviated to save 
space.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, so you&#39;re saying that we&#39;re no different than your Earth armies? 
Thanks,&quot; Maze said dryly. 

Mina giggled. &quot;Not at all, it&#39;s just that doing stuff like that is so 
basic a military tactic that it&#39;s universal.&quot; 

&quot;She may have a point,&quot; Tolaris said. 

&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Ami asked as she pointed to a group of symbols. &quot;This 
looks like a name, but I&#39;ve never been able to fully grasp the rules 
of when you use that apostrophe in the middle of words.&quot; 

&quot;K&#39;tal,&quot; Tolaris explained. &quot;He was my second officer, so to speak, 
and is now in command of the Dragoons.&quot; 

&quot;So that made Shar-Tei your first officer?&quot; Mina inquired. 

Tolaris sighed heavily at the mention of Shar-Tei&#39;s name. &quot;Yes, she 
was.&quot; 

Mina blinked at the unexpected reaction. &quot;Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to dredge 
that up,&quot; she aplogized. 

&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; Ami said after a moment. &quot;This just looks like a 
normal message sent to users on a network that&#39;s about to be shut 
down.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to look like,&quot; Maze explained. &quot;However, 
this computer was supposed to have been attached to an isolated 
network. In other words, there shouldn&#39;t have been any need for an 
alt-route.&quot; 

&quot;You read too fast, Ami,&quot; Mina said with a grunt. &quot;What&#39;s a search 
worm?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s an invasive program that sneaks into a computer, looks for 
something in particular, and reports back to its creator on what it 
found,&quot; Ami said. 

&quot;It&#39;s like a Trojan Horse, right?&quot; Mina asked hesitantly. 

Ami gave her an odd look. &quot;In a sense, yes, only it&#39;s not destructive. 
Should I bother asking what you know about hacking into computers?&quot; 

The blonde made a face. &quot;Hacking is such a harsh term, Ami. Okay, so 
Sailor V did have to do a bit of creative reconaissance involving a 
set of computer-controlled security cameras on one unremarkable 
occasion, but she never &#39;hacked&#39; into a computer database or destroyed 
anything before. You on the other hand....&quot; 

&quot;We don&#39;t need to discuss my computer skills at the moment,&quot; Ami said 
quickly. &quot;I was just wondering what you knew.&quot; 

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Tolaris sighed. 

Ami blushed. &quot;Well.... I didn&#39;t quite understand how to log into the 
cathedral&#39;s mainframe computer at first, so I had to bypass all of the 
security functions. I never destroyed anything.... unless you count 
the Trojan Horse I transmitted on a wide-band frequency during our 
first trip into the Negaverse. I don&#39;t think that worked, though....&quot; 

Maze coughed. &quot;You mean the one that went off when someone tried to 
save any sort of file with the words &#39;Sailor Scouts&#39; in the file?&quot; 

Ami blinked. &quot;You mean it worked?&quot; she said incrediously. &quot;That was 
something I wrote in an effort to relieve some frustration. I never 
thought your computers would have been able to do anything with it due 
to the extremely differing architecture.&quot; 

&quot;It worked only because some numbnut cadet ran across a copy of a 
program written in a computer language he had never seen before, 
somehow managed to translate the coding into a standard Negaverse 
code, and ran it,&quot; Maze said with a grunt. 

Ami couldn&#39;t contain the grin slowly spreading across her face. &quot;So 
what happened?&quot; 

&quot;Looking at the original coding, it was only supposed to work on files 
with the keywords in the file name, right?&quot; Maze asked. He received a 
nod in reply and he continued. &quot;Well, that fool cadet mistranslated 
that and set it to go off if it found the keywords anywhere in the 
file. The end result was that your &#39;Trojan Horse&#39; quickly mutated into 
an armed search worm.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked, his gaze alternating between Ami&#39;s smug expression 
and the slightly haunted look in Maze&#39;s tan eyes. &quot;What do you mean by 
an armed search worm?&quot; he asked warily. 

&quot;It became a search-and-destroy program. If it found a file with that 
so much as mentions &#39;Sailor Scouts&#39; in the contents, it deleted it,&quot; 
Maze grumped. &quot;That little bug ate a good ten percent of the files in 
the central computer before we picked up on it and started isolating 
memory banks. The task of flushing it out fell to the Dragoons, and 
the person with the most experience in dealing with rogue programs got 
the job of cleaning up. Guess who that person was?&quot; Maze explained, 
giving Ami an icy glare. 

Ami blushed. &quot;Sorry.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;I thought they would have given it to Asrial.&quot; 

&quot;They would have if she hadn&#39;t been on assignment,&quot; Maze grumbled. 
&quot;She wasn&#39;t around, so it fell to me. I&#39;d compliment you on doing good 
work, Ami, if I didn&#39;t have to spend a month trying to squish that 
worm.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry....&quot; Ami giggled, not sounding the least bit repentant. 

&quot;And you say I&#39;m a bad girl....&quot; Mina snickered. 

Ami made a grunting noise as her facial expression changed 
unexpectedly, causing everyone to blink in confusion. &quot;What was that 
about?&quot; Mina asked. 

&quot;Mmph,&quot; Ami said, letting the tip of her tongue protrude past her lips 
to show everyone the blood on it. &quot;When biting your tongue to keep 
from making any sort of smart aleck reply, make sure you use flat 
teeth and not fangs,&quot; she muttered. 

&quot;We try,&quot; Maze said dryly. 

&quot;One of the downsides to being a vampire,&quot; Ami said, her humorous mood 
now forgotten. &quot;Okay, enough about my computer skills and back to this 
message. What&#39;s wrong with it?&quot; 

&quot;It never should have been sent,&quot; Tolaris explained, &quot;Nor should this 
computer have been invaded by a search worm unless someone on the 
other end of this network is trying to reach us.&quot; 

Mina looked at the message again. &quot;So do you think this K&#39;tal is 
trying to reach us?&quot; 

&quot;I think he&#39;s trying to look for me,&quot; Tolaris clarified. &quot;Here, let me 
show you what we wrote back and forth.&quot; 

Ami and Mina spent the next half-hour trying to translate the spidery 
text into something more immediately comprehensible. &quot;Okay,&quot; Ami said 
after a few minutes of careful study. &quot;I take it a keytape is like a 
punch card in the sense that it has data physically imprinted on it?&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Exactly. However, this keytape doesn&#39;t exist in a 
physical form, only as a stream of data. That modulator chip Mina 
borrowed is capable of turning that data into a secure algorithm used 
to scramble and descramble communications traffic.&quot; 

&quot;Which you would then use to talk to this K&#39;tal person, right?&quot; Mina 
said as she rubbed at her temples. She felt Maze&#39;s fingertips brush 
hers aside and she leaned back to let him gently massage her head. 

&quot;Which we&#39;re not sure he&#39;s who he claims to be,&quot; Ami finished up. 

&quot;In a nut,&quot; Tolaris replied with a shrug. 

Mina giggled. &quot;In a nutshell, you mean.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;Leave me alone, I&#39;m still working on learning that 
part of your language.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re doing just fine,&quot; Ami consoled him. 

&quot;Here&#39;s the bottom line,&quot; Tolaris said as he picked up the circuit 
board with the modulator soldered into it. &quot;Unless any of you have any 
objections, I intend to connect this chip to the computer, use it to 
establish a secure link to the other end of this dimensional 
phase-link, and find out who wants to talk to me and why.&quot; 

Mina suddenly sat up, mildly startling Maze in the process. &quot;Sorry,&quot; 
she apologized. &quot;Commander, what are the odds that this is another one 
of those fun traps of Rune&#39;s that we&#39;ve come to know and love?&quot; 

Maze pulled a tissue out of his pocket and held it out to her. &quot;Here, 
use this. You&#39;re dripping sarcasm on the floor.&quot; 

Tolaris coughed discreetly and spoke before the blonde could formulate 
an appropriate reply. &quot;There is a significant chance that this is 
indeed one of Rune&#39;s traps, but I have my doubts. Granted K&#39;tal is 
just a little on the, shall we say, trigger-happy side when it comes 
to situations needing tact, but I honestly think that he has his 
reasons for doing what he did.&quot; 

Ami and Mina exchanged concerned glances for several seconds before 
Mina wrinkled her nose and made a gesture in the general direction of 
the living room. Ami nodded and stood up. 

&quot;Go ahead and connect the chip to the computer, but don&#39;t use it yet,&quot; 
Ami told Tolaris. &quot;Mina and I have to discuss this with Luna and the 
others first to see if we really want to take the risk of announcing 
our presence to General Rune or whomever is sitting on the other end 
of that thing.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded and leaned over to kiss her cheek. &quot;I understand, love. 
Maze, do you remember where I put that screwdriver set?&quot; 

Maze snickered. &quot;Last I saw of it was about half a second before I 
sent it flying across the hall after I got electrocuted awhile back. 
No idea where it wound up.&quot; 

Tolaris stood up and sighed. &quot;See if I ever let you borrow those 
again,&quot; he grumbled as he left the room to search for them. Ami and 
Mina exchanged a partially amused glance before Mina shrugged. 

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go see what the others think of this,&quot; Mina said. 

&quot;What do you think of it?&quot; Ami inquired as she followed the blonde 
down the hall towards the living room. 

Mina sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll let you know when I make up my mind.&quot; 

Ami frowned to herself and remained silent, her own doubts about the 
situation starting to weigh heavily upon her. This could either help 
us a lot or hurt us very badly, she thought. Do we really want to risk 
it? 

Still thinking, she entered the living room with a sigh and, making 
sure she had everyone&#39;s full attention, began to speak about the 
situation. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

They plane-shifted into another section of The Dark, which looked and 
felt just like the area they had just left. As soon as they had 
materialized she was on the alert, nervously looking in all directions 
around her for any sign of anything even remotely hostile. After a few 
seconds, she was satisified that she was undetected for the time being 
and started her search. 

Her search only lasted for a few moments before she froze, her senses 
screaming an alarm that something was wrong. Moving as quickly as 
possible while trying to remain seemingly motionless, she scanned the 
area around her again, searching for anything that seemed 
out-of-place. 

She blinked as something seemed to be missing. A reflex automatically 
checked her holding pouch for everything, momentarily surprising her 
to find a soul inside before she remembered she was carrying it. 
Satisfied that she was still carrying everything she had when she 
left, she began to move in a small circle, searching carefully even 
though she had no idea what she was looking for. 

She froze as she thought she detected the faintest movement in front 
of her. On impulse, she began to run various sensory filters over her 
optic nerves in an attempt to look at the entire energy spectrum. She 
paused in mid-cycle as the sense of something missing returned, 
nagging at the edge of her mind. 

She began to cycle through the filters once more, only this time at a 
much slower pace, comparing each image to the previous ones. She 
paused when her eyes were attuned to background radiation, appearing 
to her as a somewhat hazy collection of colored sources of radiation. 
She looked around her slowly and froze when she saw a section of The 
Dark that was completely devoid of any background radiation at all. 

Fear filled her when she realized that it wasn&#39;t an absence of 
radiation she saw but the result of something blocking her line of 
vision. She began to shake when she realized that she only had two 
choices: Ignore it and hope that it wasn&#39;t a creature trying to hunt 
her, or she could do a scan for life energy and give her location away 
in the process. 

She remained absolutely still as she contemplated the situation. It 
was her guess that she was as invisible to it as it was to her, but 
that was only because she wasn&#39;t moving and actively trying to mask 
her presence. The scan for life energy would let her clearly see what 
it was, but the burst of energy she gave off would announce her 
presence like a flare in the dark. 

She was just about to make her choice when the creature suddenly 
became visible and she was engulfed in a burst of radiation. Her brain 
had just identified it as a life energy scan when her reflexes kicked 
in and she darted away as fast as she could move, trying to escape 
from the creature. 

The creature was simply too fast. Within a mere moment it had closed 
the short distance between them and snared her in what might have been 
called a tendril of energy. The realization that she was about to die 
had just sunk into her brain when a beam of energy shot out of the 
darkness, narrowly missing her and striking the creature square in the 
center of its mass. 

The creature began to writhe around in agony as its life energy was 
being polarized by the sudden attack. She had barely enough time to 
grasp what was going on before she was grabbed by a second creature 
and felt herself being torn apart by a teleport. 

She had no idea where her molecules reassembled themselves, nor did 
she care as she tried to deal with the agonizing pain that a molecular 
teleport brought on. All that mattered was that she was alive, but the 
pain gave her second thoughts about enjoying it. 

&quot;I am sorry I had to do that, but I wasn&#39;t ready enough for a 
dimensional shift,&quot; a voice said as he released his hold on her. He 
looked at her oddly for a moment before he remembered. &quot;So we meet 
again,&quot; he said, then speaking the syllables of her true-name. 

The shock of her true-name being spoken drowned out the residual pain 
she was in. &quot;How...?&quot; she asked as she looked up at her savior, trying 
to discern his identity. &quot;You....&quot; 

He nodded. &quot;So you do remember me.&quot; 

&quot;How do you know my true-name?&quot; she whispered, the shock being 
replaced by fear at the situation, for she knew that he now held 
absolute power over her with the knowledge of her true-name. 

&quot;That is unimportant, my friend,&quot; he said softly. &quot;What is more 
important is why have you come here? This region is far more dangerous 
than the area you usually inhabit.&quot; 

&quot;Actually, I was looking for you,&quot; she said quietly. 

He blinked in mild surprise. &quot;Looking for me?&quot; he echoed. 

&quot;You once spoke of a legend of a kingdom that lies outside The Dark,&quot; 
she explained. &quot;I believe you referred to it as the &#39;Moon Kingdom.&#39;&quot; 

He looked at her with an intense gaze for a moment, making her 
slightly wary of the whole situation. &quot;I doubt you have manged to 
escape The Dark, yet you speak of that which lies outside of this 
neo-void,&quot; he said softly. &quot;How did you come by that name?&quot; 

She hesitated for a moment, unsure of how far she could trust him. He 
saw the look on what passed for her face and gave her a comforting 
look. &quot;Believe me when I say I have no reason to wish you harm. I am 
merely curious as to how you came across a reference to the Moon 
Kingdom.&quot; 

&quot;A soul told me about it,&quot; she said, her voice a bare whisper. 

He gave her an odd look. &quot;A soul? I don&#39;t understand.&quot; 

She finally made a decision and withdrew the glowing soul from her 
storage pouch. &quot;Listen to her,&quot; she said as she held the soul out to 
him. She saw him carefully touch it like it was a poisonous object, 
then watched as his eyes nearly tripled in diameter as the soul spoke 
to him. 

&lt;Who are you?&gt; he thought-broadcasted, the shock of having the soul 
speak to him upsetting him enough to forget to direct his thought only 
at the soul. He listened intently as Pluto reawoke and told her 
fragmented story again. 

&quot;A thousand years?&quot; he whispered aloud. &quot;Wait.... I&#39;ve seen something 
like this before.... Hold her,&quot; he said as he held out the glowing 
soul to her. She carefully accepted the soul and watched in amazement 
as his form began to dissolve, quickly collapsing into a swirling 
maelestrom. 

She blinked as something intangible emerged from the center of the 
vortex and floated to the ground. The tiny particles quickly coalesced 
into their usual solid form and he picked up the object. &quot;I found this 
a long time ago, but didn&#39;t know what it was or what to do with it,&quot; 
he said as he held it out to her. 

She took it from him and nearly dropped it in shock when she 
recognized it. &quot;It&#39;s another one!&quot; she said in utter amazement. &quot;It&#39;s 
another soul, just like Pluto was when I found her!&quot; 

&quot;Strange it could have existed this long without fading out,&quot; he 
mused. &quot;How did you revive Pluto?&quot; 

&quot;I gave it as much energy as I could spare,&quot; she replied. 

&quot;Interesting....&quot; he said as he turned his mind inward to his own 
supply of energy. He carefully extracted a tendril of energy and 
transferred it to the nearly faded soul, waiting to see what the 
reaction would be. 

Both of them jumped as the soul sucked up the tendril of energy like a 
vacuum. They took a closer look at it and noticed that the soul had 
taken on a very faint yellow glow. 

&quot;Most interesting,&quot; he commented. &quot;If it&#39;s energy it wants, I think I 
have enough available to satisfy its immediate needs.&quot; He searched 
inward and extracted almost half of his reserve supply of energy, 
carefully transferring it to the soul. 

The tendrils of energy quickly wrapped themselves around the soul, 
causing it to glow brighter and brighter until there was a blinding 
flash of light. When they could see again, they saw a vibrant yellow 
ball of light floating calmly in the air. The only visible difference 
between it and Pluto&#39;s soul was the color. 

&quot;Unbelievable,&quot; he said after a moment. Carefully, almost fearfully, 
he reached out and touched the soul. After a careful check to ensure 
that the soul was still intact, he picked up Pluto&#39;s soul and held the 
two next to each other. 

&lt;.........&gt; 

&lt;Who&#39;s there?&gt; Pluto said. 

&lt;Another soul like yourself,&gt; he answered. &lt;I have revived it, but I 
have no idea how to awaken it.&gt; 

&lt;Who are you?&gt; Pluto asked. &lt;You sound different than the one I spoke 
to earlier.&gt; 

&lt;You may call me Mephisto,&gt; he replied. &lt;But what is more important is 
to awaken your friend.&gt; 

&lt;.........&gt; 

&lt;She stirs....&gt; 

&lt;Is it a she?&gt; Mephisto asked. 

&lt;I think so. It feels very.... familiar....&gt; 

&lt;........?&gt; 

&lt;Talk to her, then. I will not interfere.&gt; 

&lt;I will try,&gt; Pluto replied. 

&lt;....?.....???&gt; 

&lt;Relax.... nothing will hurt you....&gt; 

&lt;...?.....?............!&gt; 

&lt;........Alex?&gt; 

&lt;!..... S...... Ssssss....&gt; 

&lt;Stay calm, you&#39;re still waking up.....&gt; 

&lt;Ssss.... Susan?&gt; 

&lt;!!! Alex, is is you!&gt; 

&lt;W.... where....&gt; 

&lt;Slowly, Alex. Let your mind reawaken on its own.&gt; 

&lt;M.... Mich.... w.... where.... where is Mich?&gt; 

&lt;I see you haven&#39;t changed,&gt; Pluto said, mildly amused. 

&lt;...?.... What happened?&gt; 

&lt;I&#39;m not quite sure, but that&#39;s not important right now. Your mind 
needs to wake up, but do it slowly. Don&#39;t try to force anything, just 
let it come back to you on its own,&gt; she said soothingly. 

&lt;..........?&gt; 

&lt;What?&gt; 

&lt;Someone.... else?&gt; 

&lt;What do you mean?&gt; 

&lt;I think she means me,&gt; Mephisto said quietly. 

&lt;Who.... who are you?&gt; 

&lt;His name is Mephisto,&gt; Pluto replied. &lt;He found you and kept you 
safe.&gt; 

&lt;...? Thank you....&gt; 

&lt;You are more than welcome. Tell me, what is your name?&gt; 

&lt;My name...?&gt; 

&lt;I think she&#39;s still not fully awake yet,&gt; Pluto said softly. 

&lt;My name.... is.... is....&gt; 

&lt;Easy, Alex, don&#39;t fight it....&gt; 

&lt;My name is.... Uranus....&gt; 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

General Rune sighed and glanced down at the display console she had 
been staring at for the past hour. The display was split into three 
windows, the first two showing an overhead tactical map of each of the 
polar oceans while the third displayed the results of several scans of 
the region where the odd rift was still forming. 

&quot;What&#39;s the latest word from the Leviathans?&quot; Rune called out over her 
shoulder. 

Lieutenant Admiral Ne&#39;tan walked over from the communications console 
to stand next to her. &quot;Leviathan North reports no contacts,&quot; he said 
in a low, even tone. &quot;We have not yet received an update from 
Leviathan South.&quot; 

Rune frowned. &quot;Where exactly are they?&quot; 

Ne&#39;tan reached past her to quickly tap a few buttons on the keypad at 
the base of the display. After a few seconds, a pair of green circles 
lit up on the screen, one in each polar region. &quot;These were their last 
known positions as of ten minutes ago. For various security reasons 
they never report their exact positions, instead giving us a certain 
radius that they are currently operating in.&quot; 

The frown on Rune&#39;s face deepened as she digested the information. The 
Navy was fiercely protective of their ultra-secret Leviathan project 
for some unknown reason, a fact that didn&#39;t sit well with Rune&#39;s Army 
background. &quot;Who knows their exact locations?&quot; 

Ne&#39;tan shook his head. &quot;Only the captain of each Leviathan and their 
navigators.&quot; 

Rune have the Navy second-in-command a sharp look. &quot;Not even Admiral 
Si&#39;ren knows?&quot; 

Ne&#39;tan&#39;s reply was cut off by the loud voice of one of the 
communication console operators. &quot;Sir, Leviathan South reports 
multiple submerged contacts. The are assuming a Stage 2 Alert as per 
orders and are rigging for ultra-quiet to assess the situation. They 
will report when they have further information provided they can 
transmit while remaining silent.&quot; 

Rune&#39;s fingers were a blur as she punched in several commands into the 
display console. On the far wall of the tiny underground command 
center, the topographic map of the Negaverse vanished and was replaced 
with a full-size display of the southern ocean. As further commands 
were entered, various objects and types of information were 
superimposed on the map. The green ring that appeared tiny on Rune&#39;s 
display was several inches across on the map, representing an area of 
several square nautical miles. 

All eyes turned to the map when five smaller white rings appeared, 
each denoting the possible location of a submerged contact. The rings 
were close enough to overlap each other several times, indicating that 
the contacts were rather close to one another. 

&quot;Someone contact Admiral Si&#39;ren and tell her to report here 
immediately,&quot; Rune ordered. 

&quot;Someone starting a war?&quot; Si&#39;ren asked as she walked into the command 
center. Unlike Queen Beryl and her predecessors, she had always 
preferred to receive her information as it came in, instead of having 
to wait for various military personnel to process it into something 
the Queen could understand. Discovering that General Rune preferred to 
do the same had given the admiral a small measure of hope that the 
throne&#39;s power would be more focused on what the military was doing, 
as opposed to worrying about what the rest of the civillian population 
was planning. 

If Rune seemed surprised at Si&#39;ren&#39;s sudden entrance, she hid it well. 
&quot;I&#39;m glad to see that timing doesn&#39;t go down the tubes in a crisis,&quot; 
she observed. &quot;Leviathan South just reported several submerged 
contacts.&quot; Rune took one look at the way Si&#39;ren&#39;s eyes doubled in size 
and decided that this was a very bad development. 

&quot;What is Leviathan South doing right now?&quot; Si&#39;ren asked Ne&#39;tan. 

&quot;They have assumed a Stage 2 Alert and have rigged for ultra-quiet,&quot; 
he replied evenly. &quot;They will respond when they have more information 
on the situation, provided they do not risk revealing their position 
in the attempt.&quot; 

Rune waited patiently for Si&#39;ren to finish cussing beneath her breath. 
&quot;I will admit ignorance to some of your branch&#39;s terminology,&quot; Rune 
said very evenly, &quot;As no doubt you are sometimes confused by ours. 
What exactly takes place when they &#39;rig for ultra-quiet?&#39;&quot; 

Si&#39;ren ran her fingers through her close-cropped white hair. &quot;Do you 
want the short-and-stupid version or the long-and-complex version?&quot; 
she asked. 

Rune raised an eyebrow. &quot;Short-and-stupid will work for the time 
being,&quot; she said dryly. &quot;The full explanation can wait until I have 
the time to deal with the headache caused by technical details.&quot; 

&quot;Very well,&quot; Si&#39;ren said with a soft smile. &quot;In short, they&#39;re doing 
their absolute best to remain as quiet as possible, which means they 
make no motion at all, turn off all active sensors, and don&#39;t transmit 
any messages. In other words, they make like a hole in the water.&quot; 

Rune turned back to the oversized display board, already deep in 
thought. &quot;Can they move when ultra-quiet?&quot; she asked absently. 

&quot;They can, but as any motion makes some degree of noise underwater, 
they can only move very slowly and still remain undetectable,&quot; Ne&#39;tan 
explained. 

&quot;And what are they armed with again?&quot; Rune asked. She heard silence in 
reply and she turned around to fix Si&#39;ren with a look. &quot;I asked a 
question, Admiral, and I would appreciate an answer.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren suddenly appeared to be slightly nervous. &quot;Forty sub-surface 
missiles, ten sub-surface-to-air missiles, and thirty ballistic 
missiles.&quot; 

Rune blinked hard. &quot;And with what kind of warhead on each?&quot; 

&quot;Impact, conventional, and either conventional or nuclear, 
respectively,&quot; the admiral replied softly. 

Rune looked back at the map and studied the large green ring. &quot;Let me 
summarize this,&quot; she said, her voice deceptively soft. &quot;We have a pair 
of Navy vessels in operation that don&#39;t report their exact whereabouts 
to anyone, have the ability to disappear off of the rest of the Navy&#39;s 
sensors at will, are able to go beyond the reach of the secure 
frequency communications net, and are armed with enough nuclear 
weapons to turn a good tenth of the known map into so much 
free-floating radioactive air pollution. Am I right?&quot; 

A sudden noise behind her caused her to whirl around in time to see a 
Navy officer draw his side-arm and point it at her. Immediately the 
room erupted into chaos as everyone scrambled to either get out of the 
way or to try to stop the assassination attempt. &quot;Die, bitch!&quot; the 
officer screamed as he pulled the trigger a scant second before he was 
taken down by three people. 

Rune would have been shot in the dead-center of her chest if she 
hadn&#39;t been forcibly shoved aside by Ne&#39;tan. His actions saved Rune 
from immediate harm but put himself in the path of the projectile. 
There was a muffled crack as the round imbedded itself in his ribcage 
and the small explosive charge detonated. 

Rune looked up in time to see Ne&#39;tan&#39;s amber eyes widen in shock as 
most of his lifeblood was splashed across the wall, creating a hideous 
cascade of blue that immediately started to pool around him. Then the 
life faded from his eyes as his brain overloaded from the extreme 
shock and simply shut down, mercifully sparing him from any sensation 
of pain. 

She quickly sprang to her feet, the adrenaline burning in her veins 
like wildfire and her senses alert for any further attempts on her 
life. A quick glance around the room was all it took for her to 
realize that Si&#39;ren and the other naval officers had things under 
control. 

Two ensigns had the would-be assassin in secure arm-lock, putting 
enough pressure on his arms to make the bones creak loud enough for 
Rune to hear from across the room. A lieutenant had secured the 
side-arm and was pointing it at the man&#39;s forehead, ready to pull the 
trigger in an instant. 

Rune blinked when she saw the expression on Si&#39;ren&#39;s face. She had 
known the admiral for decades, but had never seen her as furious as 
she was now. So perhaps it wasn&#39;t a Navy plot after all, Rune thought, 
or perhaps the admiral is a first-rate actress.... 

Si&#39;ren made sure that the assassin was securely restrained before she 
walked over and forced him to look up at her. &quot;What were you 
thinking?&quot; she seethed, her eyes showing quite clearly her anger. 

&quot;You know why the Leviathan project was started,&quot; he replied. &quot;And now 
you betray it to someone like her? Had I known you were as undeserving 
as she is, I&#39;d have fired the next shell at you.&quot; 

&quot;General Rune,&quot; Si&#39;ren said quietly, her voice absolutely flat, &quot;Do 
you have any questions for him?&quot; 

Rune frowned. Ordinarily she would have turned the assassin over to 
her own security force for detailed questioning, followed by a 
suitably messy execution, but something in the back of her mind told 
her to let Si&#39;ren handle the situation. 

&quot;I doubt he would be able to answer the questions I have in mind,&quot; 
Rune said after a few moments of silence. 

Si&#39;ren heard the odd tone in the general&#39;s voice and turned to look at 
her, the two women communicating somehow without word or gesture. &quot;I 
see,&quot; Si&#39;ren said quietly. &quot;Then as I doubt neither of us have any 
patience left for the matter, is there any particular way you would 
like to see him die?&quot; 

Rune blinked in surprise, having expected Si&#39;ren to have the officer 
taken away for further questioning. She briefly toyed with several 
options that sounded appealing to her before she caught the look in 
the admiral&#39;s dark eyes. &quot;Surprise me,&quot; Rune said with a small smile. 

Si&#39;ren didn&#39;t smile back, only nodding her head once before turning 
her attention to the assassin and reaching out. Her hand had almost 
touched the base of his throat when she paused and cast a quick glance 
back towards Rune. &quot;You aren&#39;t squeamish, are you?&quot; she asked. 

Rune blinked in surprise again, caught off-guard by the question. &quot;Of 
course not,&quot; she said, giving Si&#39;ren an uncertain look. 

This time, a soft smile tugged at the corners of Si&#39;ren&#39;s mouth. 
&quot;Good,&quot; she said simply and turned back to the assassin, her 
fingertips lightly making contact with his skin. &quot;This may get.... 
disturbing.&quot; 

Nothing happened for a few seconds at first. Then Rune noticed that 
the assassin was starting to sweat, his eyes starting to go wide for 
some reason. Rune knew something was happening when his skin started 
to turn a light shade of pink and his muscles started to twitch. The 
two ensigns holding onto him began to exchange nervous glances and 
discreetly began to shift positions, wary at what was happening. 

Si&#39;ren laughed very softly. &quot;You two may release him and step back. He 
isn&#39;t going anywhere anymore. As for you, Lieutenant,&quot; she said, 
addressing the officer still holding the assassin&#39;s weapon, &quot;I want 
that weapon taken down to the lab and analyzed. I don&#39;t recall ever 
seeing that type of shell being used before, and I want to know all 
about it.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the lieutenant replied as he made a hasty exit, not 
wanting to stay around to see the assassin&#39;s demise. The assassin was 
now making choking noises as his eyes started to bulge and his skin 
started to redden. 

&quot;My, you&#39;re a tough one,&quot; Si&#39;ren commented. &quot;I think you have about 
one more minute of life left in you before you die.&quot; 

Rune remained silent as she sought to figure out just what exactly 
Si&#39;ren was doing to him. She immediately ruled out electrocution, as 
his short hair wasn&#39;t standing on end or crackling with static. He 
wasn&#39;t bleeding yet, or at least not that she could see, so she 
tentatively ruled out any sort of internal damage being done. Still, 
she thought, she&#39;s doing something.... 

Si&#39;ren smiled as steam began to emerge from his mouth. &quot;I suggest that 
everyone take a few steps back,&quot; she said lightly. &quot;And if you are of 
the squeamish type, you are dismissed from the command center.&quot; 

Of the twelve people in the command center, only five bothered to 
remain and watch. Rune cast a quick glance at the retreating mass of 
people before she turned back to watch the assassin. He appeared to 
have lost all muscular control and now his abdomen appeared to be 
swelling slightly. The realization of what was happening had just 
occurred to Rune when the assassin let out a high-pitched whistling 
noise a bare second before his entire body exploded outwards. 

Rune reflexively ducked as an unholy amount of blood and gore was 
thrown into the air and started raining down. She waited until the 
last of the bits and pieces had fallen before she cautiously stood up 
and looked around, her stomach churning at both the sight and the 
smell of burnt flesh. 

Si&#39;ren was calmly brushing off the front of her uniform, which was now 
a solid mass of pink and blue ichor. She caught the horrified look in 
Rune&#39;s eyes and shrugged. &quot;&#39;Any day that I am covered up to my elbows 
in the blood of my enemies is a good day,&#39;&quot; she quoted with a casual 
smile. &quot;This uniform is going to need some serious work, though.&quot; 

Rune finally found her voice. &quot;Who said that?&quot; she asked, a small 
creak still in her voice despite her best efforts. 

The smile fell from Si&#39;ren&#39;s lips. &quot;General Nop&#39;tera.&quot; 

&quot;I see,&quot; Rune said as she surveyed the control room. &quot;You,&quot; she said 
as she pointed at a young lieutenant who was obviously fighting her 
nausea. &quot;I want you to call maintenance and tell them that we need a 
cleaning team over here. Make sure they send people who aren&#39;t easily 
nauseated, and be sure to specify that they need to spray everything 
down with a heavy-duty type of disinfectant.&quot; 

The lieutenant could only nod in numb compliance before she turned 
around and quickly bolted down the hall towards the nearest latrine. 
Rune closed her eyes and counted to ten, opened them slowly, and 
turned to face Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren. 

&quot;I&#39;ll admit that was a surprise. What exactly did you do?&quot; she asked. 

Si&#39;ren gave her a mild look. &quot;I have a strong control over water,&quot; she 
replied. &quot;Part of the reason I joined the Navy instead of the rest of 
the ground-based military. As for our friend here, he was composed of 
eighty-six percent water, just like the rest of us.&quot; 

&quot;So you boiled that water?&quot; Rune finished for her, slightly disgusted. 

Si&#39;ren spread her hands. &quot;Very messy, but very effective, wouldn&#39;t you 
say, General Rune? Tell me you wouldn&#39;t have crystalized something in 
his bloodstream or something to that effect.&quot; 

Rune indeed had considered doing exactly that, although she had never 
attempted to do such a thing before. &quot;It matters not. I think it is 
safe to say that justice has been served, but there still leaves quite 
a lot that needs to be answered,&quot; Rune said slowly. 

Si&#39;ren nodded. &quot;Indeed, and I may have some of the answers that you 
seek. But this is not the place and my uniform needs to be changed. 
Ensign Raw&#39;eth, you will oversee the clean-up of the center and 
continue to monitor the situation with Leviathan South. If anything 
changes, notify me in my quarters at once. Understood?&quot; 

&quot;Understood perfectly, ma&#39;am,&quot; the stocky ensign replied crisply. 

Si&#39;ren nodded and turned to Rune. &quot;I believe there is an Earth saying 
that goes, &#39;The time has come... to talk of many things.&#39;&quot; 

Rune nodded silently and followed Si&#39;ren out of the command center and 
down the corridor, her mind already sorting the questions she would 
ask about not only the Leviathan project, but about other things as 
well. Who knows, she mused, this might turn out to be exactly what I 
need after all.... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Leda quietly walked into the room, trying not to disturb anyone from 
their work. As she looked around, she had to bite her tongue to keep 
herself from giggling out loud. And me without my camera, she thought 
to herself. 

The front casing of the crystal computer had been removed and Tolaris 
had both of his arms buried up to his elbows inside. From what she 
could see, he had a series of wires held in one hand, some sort of 
tool in the other, and a small penlight clamped between his teeth. 

Maze had pried up several of the floor tiles in order to get to the 
main node of the dimensional phase-link connector. All that could be 
seen of him were a pair of sweatpants-clad legs hooked around a bar 
that had been secured between the legs of the computer table. 

&quot;Wait a minute, go back to the fourth wire again?&quot; Maze&#39;s voice 
drifted up from the pit in the floor. 

There was a dark growl from within the computer as Tolaris peered 
inside and traced down a wire. &quot;I thought we already ruled that one 
out,&quot; he said. 

&quot;Yeah, well I just discovered I had a loose connection here,&quot; Maze 
shot back. &quot;That second wire is clear, that third is definitely null, 
but I want to try to get another reading on that fourth.&quot; 

Leda gave serious consideration to yelling &#39;boo&#39; and most likely 
scaring them both. However, she thought, scaring someone holding a 
glass of water is one thing. Spooking someone poking around in 
delicate electronics or doing their impression of a bat is another. 
But still.... 

&quot;Connected,&quot; Tolaris called out. 

&quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi, that&#39;s it!&quot; Maze called out from within the depths 
of the narrow access conduit. &quot;See, told you all we had to do was pin 
down the return data path.&quot; 

Tolaris muttered something cryptic that Leda&#39;s limited knowledge of 
the denizen language couldn&#39;t translate properly. &quot;What was that about 
fish?&quot; she asked cautiously. 

There was a muffled curse as Tolaris jumped and bumped his head on the 
top edge of the computer casing. &quot;Hang on,&quot; he growled as he secured 
the wire into place with the tool he was holding. 

&quot;Who&#39;s up there?&quot; Maze called out. 

Leda smiled as she walked over to the conduit and peered down. &quot;Just 
me, Maze. We having fun yet?&quot; 

&quot;Loads,&quot; Maze replied as he glanced down at his feet to see who it 
was. 

&quot;Speaking of loads,&quot; Tolaris replied, &quot;Are we sure this line will be 
able to handle the stream of data?&quot; 

&quot;It should, but we all know how far that usually goes,&quot; Maze replied 
as he briefly returned his attention to firmly attaching the wire into 
the data hub. &quot;Look on the bright side. If it blows, at least we know 
which one it is.&quot; 

The Dragoon commander snorted. &quot;Great. In that case, you can replace 
it as I&#39;m not quite suited to hanging upside down for hours on end.&quot; 

There was a brief burst of laughter from within the conduit. &quot;I don&#39;t 
get it, boss. You can spend hours in an underwater or null-g 
environment for training, but you can&#39;t hang upside down for fifteen 
minutes to replace one simple wire?&quot; Maze said. 

Tolaris finally withdrew from the inside of the computer and cast a 
mild look at the pair of legs. &quot;It&#39;s probably the same reason why you 
can handle variable-gravity situations but can&#39;t stand free-fall.&quot; 

Maze grunted. &quot;Yeah, well....&quot; 

&quot;Do I want to ask what you two are talking about?&quot; Leda inquired. 

&quot;If you think you can follow it,&quot; Tolaris replied with a shrug. 

&quot;Put it like this,&quot; Maze grunted as he finished the last connection. 
&quot;If the Dragoons ever have to go to war again, I will probably be one 
of the six or seven people who won&#39;t be participating in the &#39;Death 
From Above&#39; tactic.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, sorry I asked,&quot; the brunette said with a sigh. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s easy. We get a large airborne transport, strap 
on airframes, fly over to our objective, and deploy once we&#39;re 
overhead.&quot; 

Leda blinked. &quot;Airframes?&quot; 

&quot;I think you humans refer to them as hang-gliders,&quot; Tolaris said. 

Maze grunted as he started to wiggle out of his inverted position. 
&quot;The only thing wrong with that idea is Kota&#39;s First Law.&quot; 

Leda looked at Tolaris in time to see the Dragoon rolling his eyes. 
&quot;And what exactly is Kota&#39;s First Law?&quot; Leda asked cautiously. 

There was another grunt as Maze flexed his legs and flipped out of the 
access conduit. &quot;Gravity works,&quot; he said. 

Leda smiled. &quot;Ahh. What goes up must come down, eh?&quot; 

&quot;Precisely.&quot; 

&quot;Admit it, Maze, you&#39;re just afraid of heights,&quot; Tolaris teased. 

The Dragoon lieutenant glared at him. &quot;I&#39;m not afraid of heights, 
boss, I&#39;m just afraid of that sudden stop at the end if I should 
happen to fall.&quot; 

&quot;I think hang-gliding would be cool,&quot; Leda said. 

&quot;You would,&quot; Maze muttered beneath his breath. 

&quot;So what brings you here?&quot; Tolaris asked before Maze went off. 

The brunette sighed. &quot;Well, first to tell you that everyone had to go 
home. Mina poked her head in here earlier to say good-bye, but you 
both looked like you had your hands full so she asked me to tell you 
when you were done.&quot; 

Maze grinned. &quot;She just didn&#39;t want to stick around to see if we 
needed to further mutilate her synthesizer for parts,&quot; he snickered. 

Leda spread her hands in a gesture of surrender. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just 
telling you what they told me. Anyway, Serena and the others came to 
an agreement to let you talk to what&#39;s-his-face in the Negaverse. 
However,&quot; she said, giving Tolaris a warning look, &quot;If anything 
happens that could even remotely put us in any sort of trouble or 
anything, cut the link and give Rei a call immediately.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded, a small frown on his face. &quot;Understood, but why should 
we call Rei instead of someone like Ami or Luna?&quot; 

Leda shrugged. &quot;Rei said something about not seeming to get much sleep 
anymore and would probably be the only one awake at odd hours in the 
morning.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s not a good sign,&quot; Tolaris observed. 

Leda shrugged again. &quot;Yeah, we know, but Rei said that she&#39;s had a lot 
on her mind as of late, and not just about school work. Mina tried to 
get her to talk about it but almost wound up getting chased out by a 
fireball.&quot; 

Maze said something cryptic in the denizen language and Tolaris 
smirked. &quot;I doubt that would be the case, lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris said 
dryly. 

Leda gave the Dragoon a dark look. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to tell Rei you said 
that about her,&quot; she said evenly. 

Maze blinked. &quot;Umm....&quot; 

The brunette giggled impulsively. &quot;Of course, I personally came to the 
same conclusion, but I&#39;m not rude enough to voice it openly like 
that.&quot; 

&quot;Now there&#39;s a first,&quot; Maze muttered beneath his breath. 

&quot;Are you two finished?&quot; Tolaris said dryly as he turned his attention 
towards the computer and began to initialize the newly installed 
computer chip. The computer immediately came back with a 
multi-harmonic chime and displayed an error message in bright red 
spider-like characters. The two denizens exchanged glances before Maze 
flushed a light shade of green and quickly climbed back down into the 
conduit. 

&quot;Problem?&quot; Leda inquired. 

&quot;Yeah, it usually works better if you turn it on after you plug it 
in,&quot; Maze said from within the depths of the conduit. &quot;The hub should 
be back up now, boss. Try it again.&quot; 

&quot;Do us a favor and stay down there until we&#39;re sure everything works,&quot; 
the Dragoon commander replied as he tried to initialize the chip 
again. The result was the same but the error message was completely 
different. 

&quot;Now what does it say?&quot; Maze called out from his inverted position. 

&quot;External matrix port not ready,&quot; Tolaris replied. 

&quot;That&#39;s your fault, not mine,&quot; the lieutenant shot back. 

Tolaris grumbled something acidic beneath his breath that Leda 
couldn&#39;t even come close to translating. He carefully reached inside 
the computer and reset the tiny power circuit connecting the modulator 
chip to the rest of the system. There was a momentary hum as power 
started to flow through the chip and it began to communicate with the 
main CPU. 

Leda smiled. &quot;Third time&#39;s the charm,&quot; she said. 

&quot;Let&#39;s hope so,&quot; Tolaris replied as he initialized the chip again. 
This time, he got a small status screen with a single, green 
spider-like character that was slowly blinking on and off. 

The brunette squinted at the character for a moment. &quot;Acting?&quot; 

Tolaris shook his head. &quot;Working. Acting is drawn like this,&quot; he said 
as he picked up a pencil and started to draw on a scrap of paper. 

Leda compared the two characters and shook her head. &quot;They&#39;re almost 
identical. How do you tell them apart so easily?&quot; 

The Dragoon shrugged. &quot;Practice, I guess. You tend to become skilled 
at certain tasks if you&#39;ve been doing them since you learned how to 
walk.&quot; 

&quot;True....&quot; 

Maze coughed lightly from within the access conduit. &quot;Language lessons 
are always nice, boss, but is everything working to the point where I 
can come on out of here now?&quot; 

Tolaris chuckled. &quot;But I thought you liked doing your impression of a 
mer&#39;cata.&quot; 

There was a derisive snort from within the conduit. &quot;Yeah, so you get 
a different view of the world when you do that, but your blood also 
tends to start pooling in your brain after a few minutes. Especially 
after you&#39;ve already spent an hour in this position.&quot; 

Leda looked up at the computer in time to see the text message change 
to a lengthy explanation of something. &quot;I think it&#39;s finished,&quot; she 
said as she struggled to translate the first five characters. 

Tolaris glanced at it and nodded. &quot;It&#39;s finished now, Maze, so you can 
climb back out of there.&quot; 

&quot;Great,&quot; Maze grunted as he quickly extracted himself from the narrow 
confines of the access conduit. As soon as he was free, he quickly sat 
down and stared up at the ceiling. &quot;Whee, blood rush....&quot; 

&quot;I thought you said you liked those,&quot; Tolaris said absently as he 
opened up a utility program and began to configure the chip&#39;s software 
interface for use with the crystal computer. 

&quot;A blood rush from fighting for your life is always a good feeling,&quot; 
Maze replied slowly as his vision slowly refocused. &quot;A rush from 
adrenaline is a good one as well. A rush from sex.... well, no need to 
comment. But a rush from having half of your blood supply go from your 
brain to your toes in two seconds is not the most pleasant of 
feelings....&quot; 

Leda giggled. &quot;You only hate that because you don&#39;t like freefall.&quot; 

&quot;You hush,&quot; the Dragoon lieutenant replied with a mild look. 

&quot;Children, please, not in here,&quot; Tolaris said as he continued to work. 

&quot;Children?&quot; Leda echoed, her green eyes narrowing. She moved forward 
to smack him upside his head but halted when she found Maze&#39;s arm 
blocking her. 

&quot;Now, now, Leda, it&#39;s not Tolaris&#39;s fault he&#39;s old enough to be one of 
your ancestors,&quot; he said smoothly with a large grin. &quot;And after all, a 
fifteen year old girl in the Negaverse would still be in post-diaper 
training.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked at Maze&#39;s words and quickly started to explain things 
to Leda before she took offense and went ballistic. &quot;What Maze is 
trying to say is that denizens have an extremely slow initial growth 
rate, both physically and mentally. It takes us five years to get past 
the initial brainless-infant stage and another ten to learn how to 
walk. Public education doesn&#39;t start until the twenty-fifth year and 
that is geared towards learning how to learn. Once our minds 
&#39;solidify&#39; as we call it, then we can begin to really learn about the 
sciences and all.&quot; 

Leda blinked as she digested all of the information. &quot;Why does it take 
denizens such an unimaginable amount of time to grow up?&quot; she asked, 
still in a mild state of awe. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;I sat down with Ami one day and compared the human 
timespan and the denizen timespan of life at certain key points. 
Surprisingly enough, the only time difference between the human 
lifespan and the denizen lifespan is the amount of time between birth 
and death of old age. Everything else is virtually a direct time 
ratio.&quot; 

Leda blinked again, this time lost by the Dragoon&#39;s words. &quot;Huh?&quot; 

Maze smiled. &quot;What he&#39;s trying to say is that if you took the 
denizen&#39;s average lifespan and crunched it down to a human&#39;s lifespan, 
we&#39;d grow up as fast as you humans do. The reverse is also true. If we 
stretch your lifespan out to two thousand years, it&#39;d take you just as 
long to grow up as we do.&quot; 

&quot;Ooooh, I get it....&quot; Leda said slowly as her mind grasped the 
concept. 

&quot;And contrary to what Maze was trying to insinuate,&quot; Tolaris said 
dryly, &quot;I do not view you and the other Sailor Scouts as being merely 
young children.&quot; 

Leda sighed and looked down at the floor. &quot;Yeah, well, we kinda still 
are that, in a way.&quot; She looked up as she felt Maze gently squeeze her 
shoulder. 

&quot;Age is a state of mind, Leda,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;So Tolaris is two 
centuries my elder. When you live as long as we do, or are supposed 
to,&quot; he added with a roll of his eyes, &quot;What does a few years matter?&quot; 

&quot;Supposed to?&quot; Leda echoed. 

Tolaris laughed humorlessly. &quot;Speaking from a strictly biological 
view, yes. However, the amount of violence in our society definitely 
has a major impact on things.&quot; 

Leda wrinkled her nose and was about to make a comment when the 
computer screen changed and a series of denizen characters appeared. A 
neutral-sounding synthetic voice filled the room as it read the words 
out loud in the denizen language. 

Maze blinked. &quot;Now this is interesting.&quot; 

Leda frowned as she studied the screen. &quot;Something about being ready?&quot; 
she asked as she quickly went over the text and paused at the few 
unfamilar characters. 

&quot;Vocal interface for dual input-output mode is ready,&quot; Tolaris 
translated. 

&quot;I take it the chip works?&quot; Maze asked cautiously. 

&quot;So far, but I still have to load the encryption key into it,&quot; Tolaris 
replied. &quot;I wonder.... Nak&#39;seth.&quot; 

&quot;Venta,&quot; the computer replied as it displayed the denizen character 
for &#39;ready&#39; on the screen. 

&quot;When did this thing become voice-activated?&quot; Maze wondered aloud. 

&quot;Wait a second....&quot; Leda said. &quot;Which circuit card is that whatever 
wired into?&quot; 

&quot;This one,&quot; Tolaris said as he picked up the penlight and shined it 
into the open computer casing. &quot;There, the one with the three amber 
lights on the left side.&quot; 

&quot;And Mina let you borrow that indefinitely?&quot; Leda gasped, her eyes 
wide. 

Maze and Tolaris exchanged mildly concerned glances. &quot;That&#39;s what she 
said,&quot; Maze said slowly. 

&quot;Oooh boy,&quot; Leda grinned. 

&quot;What?&quot; Maze said, a small frown tugging on the corners of his mouth. 

&quot;That circuit board also holds her artificial language matrix&#39;s speech 
pattern ROM. Her synthesizer won&#39;t be able to simulate human speech 
without that circuit board,&quot; Leda explained. 

&quot;Uh oh....&quot; Maze said quietly, turning rather pale. 

&quot;Human speech.... hang on,&quot; Tolaris said as he turned his full 
attention to the computer and started to work on reconfiguring the 
chip again. He worked for ten minutes before he reinitialized the chip 
and sat back, waiting to see the results. After a few moments, the 
computer displayed the previous ready message and repeated the words 
in the denizen language. 

&quot;Mmm, not a good sign,&quot; Tolaris muttered. &quot;Nak&#39;seth.&quot; 

&quot;Venta,&quot; the computer said as it displayed the denizen character. 

&quot;Looks fine to me,&quot; Maze commented. 

&quot;Computer,&quot; Tolaris said in English. 

&quot;Ready,&quot; the computer replied as it redisplayed the denizen character. 

&quot;Good enough,&quot; the Dragoon said as he sat back with a smile. 

&quot;Hey, how&#39;d you do that?&quot; Leda asked, her eyes wide with wonder. 

Maze smiled. &quot;Using Ami&#39;s translator program?&quot; he asked. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Well, I just linked her translator to that unknown 
program sitting on the chip, which thanks to Leda I now know to to be 
Mina&#39;s synthesizer language database. After that was done, I just tied 
Ami&#39;s program to the vocal interface properties of the communications 
program. And as you can see, the result is a computer that now 
understand both languages.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Maze said as he looked at the display. &quot;I take it you can&#39;t do 
a written-word translation because you don&#39;t have a master database 
for that?&quot; 

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Tolaris replied with a nod of his head. 

&quot;So this thing can understand what I say now?&quot; Leda asked with an evil 
gleam in her eyes. 

Maze and Tolaris exchanged looks before Maze smiled and Tolaris 
sighed. &quot;Yes and no, Leda,&quot; Tolaris explained as he rubbed his eyes. 
&quot;Yes if all you are doing is using the computer like a telephone to 
talk to someone or to issue brief, simple commands, but it won&#39;t 
understand most of what you say if you try to do anything else with 
it.&quot; 

&quot;Aww....&quot; 

Maze snickered. &quot;You&#39;ve been watching too much of that science fiction 
program, Star-whatever.&quot; 

Leda grinned back at him. &quot;Hey, a girl can dream, can&#39;t she?&quot; 

&quot;Nak&#39;seth, a&#39;rein kurush&#39;an-taal Tolaris aan,&quot; Tolaris said. 

&quot;A&#39;ren&#39;i,&quot; the computer replied as it displayed a single character. 

Leda blinked. &quot;I understood that except for that one word.&quot; 

&quot;If you mean kurush&#39;an-taal, it means encrypton key,&quot; Maze explained. 

&quot;Kurush&#39;an-taal a&#39;ren&#39;en,&quot; the computer said as it displayed the text. 

&quot;So far, so good,&quot; Tolaris said mildly. 

&quot;If I may interrupt for a moment,&quot; Leda said as she leaned past him to 
study the computer screen. &quot;I just want to add to my limited 
understanding here. A&#39;rein is the verb form of load, right?&quot; 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Tolaris replied. 

&quot;And a&#39;ren&#39;i means loading, right?&quot; 

&quot;Last time I checked it did,&quot; Maze replied with a smile. 

&quot;Smart aleck. Anyway, and a&#39;ren&#39;en means loaded?&quot; Leda continued. 

&quot;Correct,&quot; Tolaris said. 

&quot;So when you write it out, you add an &#39;i notation to the end of a word 
for the present-tense action and an &#39;en notation to the past-tense 
action, right?&quot; she concluded. 

Maze chuckled. &quot;Yes, but if the last syllable contains an ein mark, 
you substitute the en mark in its place when you add the notation. And 
if it has an i mark at the very end, you leave it off totally when you 
add the notation,&quot; he explained slowly. 

Leda blinked and looked over the spidery words. &quot;I think I understand 
it now,&quot; she said hesitantly. 

&quot;Good, you&#39;ll be quizzed in the morning,&quot; Tolaris said evenly. He 
looked up at the stunned expression on Leda&#39;s face and chuckled 
quietly. &quot;That was a joke, Leda.&quot; 

&quot;Not funny,&quot; she muttered as her cheeks turned pink. 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Maze chuckled. 

&quot;Umm, might I ask a potentially rude question?&quot; Leda asked cautiously. 

Maze blinked. &quot;Umm, sure.&quot; 

&quot;Why doesn&#39;t the verb k&#39;ves have the notations when you conjugate it?&quot; 

&quot;Because when you use that word, you&#39;re already conjugating,&quot; Maze 
said almost inaudibly beneath his breath. There was a strangled noise 
next to him as Tolaris bit his tongue to keep himself from laughing 
aloud at the remark. 

Leda&#39;s gaze alternated between the two Dragoons. &quot;Umm....&quot; 

&quot;You do know what that word means, right?&quot; Maze asked slowly. 

&quot;Not quite, which is why I&#39;m asking,&quot; Leda admitted with a blush. 

&quot;Oh, great, here it comes....&quot; Tolaris muttered in his native dialect, 
knowing full well that Maze probably wouldn&#39;t be able to translate his 
accent. 

&quot;I&#39;ll handle this, you go back to your work,&quot; Maze said smoothly as he 
reached out and turned Tolaris&#39;s head to face the computer screen. He 
then quietly and calmly explained to Leda the literal translation of 
the word and all of its associated connotations and implications. 

By the time he was finished, Leda&#39;s blush had deepened by at least 
five shades of red. &quot;Well now....&quot; she managed to say after a few 
seconds of silence. &quot;Any other fun words I should know about?&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t need to teach her any more profanity, Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris 
said sternly as he worked. &quot;Granted she isn&#39;t a child, but her mind 
doesn&#39;t need to be corrupted any more than it already is.&quot; 

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Leda said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. 

&quot;Venta,&quot; the computer said, interrupting any further conversation on 
that particular topic of discussion. 

&quot;Here goes nothing,&quot; Tolaris said quietly. &quot;Computer, create secure 
link to distant end host.&quot; 

&quot;Creating,&quot; the computer said in it&#39;s synthesized neutral-toned voice 
as it displayed a denizen character. The computer hummed to itself for 
a moment before several lines of spidery text started to scroll up 
onto the screen. 

&quot;Error: Cryptographic key has not been initialized. Now initializing 
cryptographic key.... Initialization completed. Searching.... Located 
distant end. Creating link.... Link has been established. Establishing 
secure link.... Warning: Cryptographic key cycle mismatch. Attempting 
to cycle.... Cycle match established. Establishing secure link....&quot; 

&quot;This should take a bit,&quot; Tolaris said as he sat back and blew out his 
breath. &quot;Give it, what? Three minutes?&quot; 

Maze shook his head. &quot;Three to re-establish, five to establish a link 
for the first time once you get the right cycle going.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed and reached for his cup of ma&#39;cha. He picked it up, 
looked at the inside of the empty cup, and stood up with another sigh. 
&quot;Anyone else want anything to drink while I&#39;m up?&quot; 

&quot;What time is it?&quot; Leda asked. 

Maze leaned forward and peered at the tiny clock display bottom edge 
of the computer display. &quot;Should be.... somewhere around eight 
o&#39;clock.&quot; 

Leda made a face. &quot;Bah, too late for coffee. Tea if you can find some, 
whatever fruit juice is in the &#39;fridge if you can&#39;t.&quot; 

&quot;Okay. What about you, Maze?&quot; Tolaris inquired. 

&quot;Tea sounds like a good idea,&quot; he said wearily. &quot;Need to get flushed 
out anyway. Lunch is still sitting in my gut like a lead weight.&quot; 

Leda grinned as she heard Tolaris&#39;s laughter echoing all the way down 
the hall as he headed off towards the kitchen. &quot;When are you going to 
learn?&quot; 

&quot;You know how Mina gets when you turn down her cooking,&quot; Maze 
muttered. 

The brunette gave him a wicked smile. &quot;You just need to learn how to 
get out of eating her cooking without seeming to be trying to get out. 
Trust me, both Rei and myself are highly skilled at it, Darian is 
learning very quickly, and Ami somehow manages to always be 
legitimately occupied elsewhere when it&#39;s Mina&#39;s turn to cook.&quot; 

Maze shrugged. &quot;And what about Serena?&quot; 

Leda just sighed and looked up at the ceiling. &quot;Serena is either too 
dense to learn how to avoid Mina&#39;s cooking or she has a cast-iron 
stomach. Knowing her, it&#39;s probably both.&quot; 

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Maze said with a smile. &quot;And what of Artemis?&quot; 

&quot;Poor thing....&quot; Leda said with a sigh as she shivered. &quot;After living 
with her for so long, he probably doesn&#39;t even have a stomach anymore. 
Just a hose that connects his throat to his rear.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Tolaris asked as he walked into the room carrying 
several steaming mugs. 

&quot;Not much, boss, just theorizing on what prolonged exposure to Mina&#39;s 
cooking has done to Artemis&#39;s digestive system,&quot; Maze explained as he 
accepted the mug of ma&#39;cha from Tolaris. 

The Dragoon grunted as he handed the mug of tea to Leda. &quot;I can 
imagine,&quot; he said with a mildly sour look on his face. &quot;Don&#39;t get me 
wrong, Leda. Mina is a good friend and a truly remarkable girl, but 
she could probably manage to ruin breakfast cereal if you let her 
handle it.&quot; 

Leda promptly set the mug of tea down before her fit of giggles could 
spill the steaming liquid everywhere. &quot;You know,&quot; she said between 
spasms, &quot;She did that once. I think it was when we were up at the Hot 
Spring Resort, the morning after you and Darian took off.&quot; The memory 
became too much for her to handle and she sat down on the floor before 
she fell over with laughter. 

&quot;The scary thing of this is that I can picture it happening,&quot; Maze 
said. 

Tolaris chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s your girlfriend.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Maze replied as he rolled his eyes. 

&quot;Secure link established to distant end host 314.485.117.501,&quot; said 
the voice of the computer as it displayed the message in the denizen 
language on the screen. 

&quot;Good timing,&quot; Maze said as he glanced at the tiny clock. 

&quot;Aww, you just didn&#39;t want to hear us continue to tease poor Mina,&quot; 
Leda said with a giggle before she calmed down to the point where she 
could safely handle her mug of tea. 

&quot;You two sound like you&#39;re related,&quot; Tolaris said with amusement as he 
sat down in front of the computer and studied the display message. 

&quot;Hey, now....&quot; Leda said, pretending to be deeply offended. 

Tolaris blinked as the text message unexpectedly changed and the 
computer emitted a soft chime. &quot;Direct text exchange request received 
from user K&#39;tal at host 314.485.117.501 via secure link. Do you wish 
to accept or deny?&quot; the computer translated in soft monotones. 

Leda leapt to her feet and almost knocked Maze over in her haste to 
move over next to Tolaris. &quot;What did it just say?&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like K&#39;tal wants to have a word with us,&quot; Tolaris said calmly 
as he read and re-read the text message several times. 

&quot;So, you ready to find out if this is a trap?&quot; Maze asked warily. 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;Despite all you can do to prepare, you can never be 
ready for traps. But still....&quot; He sighed softly again, took a deep 
breath to calm himself, and started to pray that he wasn&#39;t about to 
make a fatal mistake. 

&quot;Computer,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;Accept request.&quot; 

The computer&#39;s response was to clear the screen and split the display 
in half horizontally. A small blinking cursor appeared on the lower 
half and a line of text was printed on the upper half. 

&quot;Text exchange session open,&quot; the computer translated. 

Maze waited impatiently for something else to happen. &quot;Well?&quot; he said 
after a few moments. 

Tolaris grunted. &quot;Fine, fine, be that way,&quot; he muttered to himself as 
he typed a quick command on the keyboard. &quot;Computer, activate 
voice-to-text interface mode,&quot; he said. 

A single character appeared on the screen in response, looking almost 
exactly like a small spider that had lost a fight with a semi on the 
highway. &quot;Active,&quot; the computer said in its monotone. 

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Tolaris said to the computer, watching with mild 
interest as his words were translated into the written denizen 
language on the lower half of the screen and sent to the distant end. 

Everyone waited in tense silence for the person on the distant end to 
respond, each wondering what the response would be. After a few 
seconds of silence, a small line of text was printed on the upper half 
of the screen and the computer began to translate. 

&quot;I am Dragoon Commander K&#39;tal, but I think you already know that. The 
question is, who exactly are you?&quot; 

&quot;Is it just me, or did that sound slightly arrogant?&quot; Leda whispered 
very quietly in Maze&#39;s ear. 

&quot;More than slightly, but that&#39;s K&#39;tal for you,&quot; Maze whispered back. 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Tolaris muttered. He then cleared his throat and spoke loud 
enough for the computer&#39;s microphone to hear. &quot;I trust you&#39;ll excuse 
my caution and hopefully have the brains to understand why, but I need 
to make sure this isn&#39;t another one of your so-called fool-proof 
traps.&quot; He then sat back and smiled while he waited for the computer 
to finish translating and send his message to the other end. 

Leda blinked at Tolaris&#39;s words and gave Maze a confused look. &quot;Excuse 
me for being dense here, but I thought he was supposed to talk to this 
guy, not piss him off,&quot; she whispered. 

Maze gave her a small smile. &quot;He&#39;s testing the other person. We&#39;ll 
know if it&#39;s really K&#39;tal or not by how he responds.&quot; 

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Leda said ominously as a few lines of text started to 
scroll up on the upper half of the screen. 

&quot;As for excusing your caution,&quot; the computer translated, &quot;I&#39;ve always 
maintained that there is no excuse for you. And contrary to what 
delusions you might currently be holding, this isn&#39;t a trap. Besides, 
I keep telling you that you should always make an idiot-proof trap 
instead of a fool-proof trap because fools can be unbelievably 
creative when you least expect it.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s him,&quot; Maze and Tolaris said simultaneously. 

&quot;Okay, so now what?&quot; Leda asked, eyeing the message warily. She was 
glad that the computer was translating the text out loud. Otherwise, 
she would have been lost after the first eight characters. 

&quot;Can I trust you?&quot; Tolaris said to the computer, counting the seconds 
until K&#39;tal&#39;s reply came back. 

&quot;Could you ever, Tolaris?&quot; the computer said. 

The Dragoon raised an eyebrow and motioned for Maze and Leda to remain 
silent. &quot;What makes you think I&#39;m Tolaris? I thought he was still 
frozen in crystal in the Wastelands.&quot; 

&quot;Butt-ugly lawn ornament that he was, some idiot set him free,&quot; said 
the monotone voice after a few seconds. &quot;Of course, if you&#39;re a 
denizen exile on Earth and don&#39;t know about that, then either you&#39;re 
playing dumb, which really isn&#39;t that hard for you, or I&#39;ve made one 
major miscalculation and will probably have to cover my tracks by 
sending the NP-3 to visit you.&quot; 

&quot;I see he hasn&#39;t changed,&quot; Maze said darkly. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;You really ought to watch your tone, K&#39;tal. Some of 
us might consider that to be disrespectful. And even if you didn&#39;t 
sleep your way to full commander, I still outrank you with 
time-in-grade. Oh, and use the NP-2 model instead. I&#39;ve discovered 
that they&#39;re surprisingly lethal if you drop them into small valleys,&quot; 
he said evenly. 

Leda sighed and rubbed her temples. &quot;Is this guy your brother or what? 
You two sound like Serena and Rei on a rainy Monday morning.&quot; 

&quot;The trick to dealing with K&#39;tal is to take whatever he throws at you 
and shove it right back,&quot; Maze smirked. &quot;You may wind up sounding like 
you&#39;re getting ready to get into a fight, but believe me, you 
accomplish quite a lot more than you would if you try to talk normally 
to him.&quot; 

&quot;Did you know that they&#39;re still developing the NP-4 series?&quot; the 
computer said as the text continued to scroll up onto the screen. &quot;You 
would think that after a hundred years, those morons would have gotten 
something right by now.&quot; 

&quot;If Rune put people like you in charge, it&#39;s no wonder,&quot; Tolaris 
replied after a few moments of silent thought. &quot;I&#39;m often surprised 
that you can change your own diapers without having to call for 
backup.&quot; 

The distant end remained silent for almost a minute, cauing Tolaris to 
worry that something was wrong. Finally, the block of text started to 
scroll up the screen again and the computer started to translate. 

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised what you can accomplish with a mirror. But as for 
calling for backup, any Dragoon will tell you that you only do that 
when you either are obviously outnumbered or when you have zero idea 
how to handle the current situation.&quot; 

Tolaris sat back with a small frown. Behind him, Leda and Maze 
exchanged concerned looks. &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound too good, boss,&quot; Maze 
said softly. &quot;If K&#39;tal is in charge, and I don&#39;t have any reason to 
doubt that he isn&#39;t, he&#39;d only request help like this if there was a 
major internal problem.&quot; 

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Tolaris said softly. &quot;Go get Ra&#39;vel and Whisper. I think 
they need to hear about this.&quot; He didn&#39;t bother to wait for an 
acknowledgement before he cleared his throat and spoke up. 

&quot;So eat some v&#39;etu. That&#39;ll help solve your digestive problems,&quot; 
Tolaris said pleasantly. &quot;If that isn&#39;t the problem, which is a common 
occurence with people as anal as you are, then I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have 
to go into some sort of detail about the situation.&quot; 

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Whisper said as she and Ra&#39;vel walked into the room. 

Tolaris quickly motioned for them to be quiet and to come over to the 
computer. &quot;I&#39;m using a voice-activated link to talk to K&#39;tal,&quot; he 
whispered to them when they were close enough to hear him. 

Whisper nodded and studied the screen, reading the log of what was 
said from both sides. Ra&#39;vel made a soft clucking noise as she ruffled 
her feathers and read the text as well, chirping quietly in laughter 
as the conversation unfolded. 

&quot;I guess you do have a lot of experience on those matters,&quot; the 
computer said as more text scrolled up. &quot;However, I&#39;m afraid a fit of 
constipation is going to be the least of our worries if what I think 
is going to happen starts to happen. I need your help, but I need to 
know if I can trust you.&quot; 

Everyone blinked at K&#39;tal&#39;s words. &quot;I think that should be my question 
to you, K&#39;tal,&quot; Tolaris said. 

There was a lengthy pause from the distant end. &quot;If you are Tolaris, 
then you have my word of honor as a Dragoon that I am the only one who 
knows about you using General Nephlyte&#39;s cathedral as a base,&quot; the 
computer translated. &quot;But I need to make absolutely sure that it&#39;s you 
there instead of some other operative.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed and looked around at the room&#39;s occupants. &quot;Time to 
make the decision. Do I tell him or not?&quot; he asked softly. 

&quot;Boss, either he&#39;s there alone or he&#39;s working with someone, but we 
know that it&#39;s K&#39;tal on the other end,&quot; Maze said. &quot;I&#39;d rather go down 
for trusting a Dragoon than for trying to save our butts and later 
discovering that he truly needed our help.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped an agreement and Whisper nodded. &quot;If we trust him, we 
may be able to help. And if we don&#39;t, he still knows that someone who 
knows the denizen language quite well is here, and that pretty much 
narrows it down to a handful of suspects. In that case, he just might 
throw a nuke at us. I say we trust him,&quot; the telepath said quietly. 

&quot;And what do you think, Leda?&quot; Tolaris asked. 

Leda chewed on the edge of her lip. &quot;Tolaris, I&#39;ve only known you for 
about half a year, but I&#39;ve trusted you with my life on several 
occasions and have yet to have my faith in you proven wrong. I know 
there&#39;s always a first time for everything, but we&#39;ll just have to 
deal with that if it ever happens. I say go for it.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Tolaris said softly and took a deep breath. &quot;Very well,&quot; 
he said out loud. &quot;Just so there is no doubt, I am Tolaris, formerly 
the ranking officer and Commander of the Dragoons until my exile to 
Earth.&quot; 

Everyone held their breath as the computer translated his words into 
the denizen text and sent it across the secure link to the distant end 
computer. The response took a surprisingly short amount of time to 
come back and Tolaris blinked as the text started to scroll up once 
more. 

&quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Commander,&quot; said the computer. &quot;However, just 
so you know and are aware of this, I may hold the rank of Commander 
myself, but every true Dragoon knows you are still the commanding 
officer.&quot; 

Tolaris sat back with a loud sigh of relief and rubbed his temples in 
an effort to get rid of the sudden tension headache. &quot;I&#39;m honored that 
I&#39;m still remembered, K&#39;tal. Forgive my bluntness, but what sort of 
crisis is happening that would cause you of all people to willingly 
violate almost every single regulation we have by trying to contact 
me?&quot; 

The response was not what Tolaris expected it to be. &quot;Commander, I&#39;m 
trying to prevent a war,&quot; the computer translated in an even monotone. 

&quot;This is not a good sign,&quot; Whisper muttered. 

&quot;What kind of war?&quot; Tolaris asked. &quot;Conventional, nuclear, what?&quot; 

The time delay was almost unbearable, and when the response finally 
came back after what seemed to have been several minutes, everyone 
suddenly wished it hadn&#39;t come back. 

&quot;Civil war,&quot; the computer said. &quot;Only this one could destroy the 
entire Negaverse in the process.&quot; 

&quot;You have my complete attention, K&#39;tal,&quot; Tolaris said flatly. 

&quot;Good, because here&#39;s the problem....&quot; the computer replied, and 
started to speak as page upon page of text started to scroll up on the 
screen. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&lt;My name is.... Uranus....&gt; she said hesitantly as she remembered. 

&lt;Do you remember what happened?&gt; the one named Mephisto asked gently. 

&lt;I.... I don&#39;t know.... my mind feels like shattered glass....&gt; 

&lt;Your memories will return in time, Alex.&gt; Pluto said softly. &lt;Just 
take it easy and try not to force anything. Let the memories awaken on 
their own.&gt; 

&lt;I&#39;m surprised they remember anything at all, given their age,&gt; said 
the soft voice of the other Shinma. She felt Pluto&#39;s soul become 
agitated again at the reminder of the passage of Time and she tried to 
comfort her. &lt;I&#39;m sorry, Pluto, I didn&#39;t mean to remind you of 
that....&gt; 

Pluto sighed. &lt;We have more important things to be concerned about 
right now, like how we&#39;re going to get our bodies back.&gt; 

&lt;Bodies...?&gt; Uranus said, more than mildly confused. 

Mephisto cast a mild glance of amusement at the glowing sphere that 
was Uranus&#39;s soul. &lt;As much as it pains me to tell you this, your body 
is most likely long turned to dust. But your soul still exists, and 
hence so do you.&gt; Uranus said nothing for several minutes. Pluto was 
about to ask if she had gone into shock when Uranus spoke up softly. 

&lt;Susan, are we.... are we dead?&gt; 

Pluto found herself doing something she had rarely done before in all 
her years of life: she started to laugh hard with genuine humor. 

&lt;Umm, Sue? I don&#39;t think being dead is very funny....&gt; 

Uranus&#39;s comment made her laugh all the harder, causing everyone else 
to suddenly worry about her sanity. She continued to laugh to herself 
for several minutes until she finally managed to calm down and control 
her emotions. 

&lt;Trust me, Alex, we are very much alive,&gt; Pluto said, a hint of a 
smile still evident in her voice. &lt;If we were dead, you would be part 
of the Crystal and I would be in a special section of the Underworld.&gt; 

&lt;Why is that?&gt; the nameless Shinma asked. 

&lt;It&#39;s a rather complicated story, but usually....&gt; Pluto stared to 
say. 

&lt;Sue!&gt; Uranus yelled in a mild state of panic. &lt;Where&#39;s Mich?&gt; 

&lt;.........&gt; Pluto said as she struggled to remember. 

&lt;I assume Mich is a friend of yours?&gt; Mephisto asked softly. 

&lt;Neptune,&gt; Pluto said suddenly. &lt;That&#39;s right, Neptune was with us 
during the battle....&gt; 

&lt;Susan....&gt; 

&lt;I know, Alex, calm down. If we&#39;re here, then she has to be around 
here as well.&gt; Pluto said. 

&quot;A third soul?&quot; she asked as she withdrew from the mental conference 
with the two glowing souls. 

&quot;So it seems,&quot; Mephisto replied. He paused and added, &quot;Are you going 
to help them find their missing friend?&quot; 

She sighed and studied the floor of Mephisto&#39;s sanctuary. &quot;We don&#39;t 
have a clue where to start looking, and even if we do find this third 
soul, it&#39;s going to take a lot of energy to revive it. I don&#39;t have 
enough to spare.&quot; 

Mephisto gave her a slightly bemused look. &quot;If all you&#39;re concerned 
about is energy, I have more than enough to spare.&quot; 

She looked up and gave him a curious look. &quot;Why would you help me with 
such a matter as this, especially when the cost is your own supply of 
energy?&quot; 

&quot;I have my reasons,&quot; he said as he looked down at the glowing yellow 
ball cupped in his hands. &quot;As for what they are,&quot; he continued, 
cutting her off before she could ask the obvious, &quot;Suffice it to say 
that they are not of any importance or impending concern to anyone but 
me.&quot; 

&quot;But the energy....&quot; 

He softly spoke the syllables of her true-name and she fell silent. He 
let the silence build for a few seconds before he spoke again. &quot;The 
energy cost of reviving this one was rather substantial, as you no 
doubt know,&quot; he said quietly as he continued to study the physical 
manifestation of Uranus&#39;s soul. &quot;However, believe me when I say that I 
have a more than ample source of energy to sustain me and my 
travelling endeavors for quite some time.&quot; 

She blinked hard, not sure which part of his statement stunned her 
more. &quot;You have a.... a source of energy?&quot; she whispered, hardly able 
to fathom the concept. The only energy she had ever been able to find 
during her entire existence was the life-energy of other beings in The 
Dark. 

Mephisto gave her a measured look, debating on the merits of letting 
her in on his most-guarded secret. &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; he said after a few 
moments of careful thought. &quot;However, that is not important right now. 
We must first locate their missing friend. Then we must find a way to 
restore their bodies and return them home.&quot; 

She blinked hard again, not believing her ears. The concept of trying 
to revive a soul removed from its body had been hard enough for her to 
grasp, and the concept of resurrecting a living being with only a soul 
to work with was making her slightly light-headed. But the concept of 
taking three life-forms and helping them escape the neo-void they had 
become trapped in would simply not register on her mind. 

&quot;Escape?&quot; she whispered incrediously. &quot;Escape from The Dark is simply 
not possible. You know that as well as I do.&quot; 

His response was to throw his head back and start laughing. &quot;Think, my 
friend,&quot; he said when his mirth subsided. &quot;How could I have learned of 
their Moon Kingdom and the outside realm unless I or someone else was 
able to visit there and return?&quot; 

&quot;Impossible....&quot; she breathed. &quot;The Dark...&quot; 

&quot;Can be breached,&quot; he interrupted her. &quot;It can be done, my friend, for 
I have done it myself.&quot; 

Shock threatened to overwhelm her. &quot;How?&quot; she said, her voice barely 
audible as a whisper. &quot;How is this possible?&quot; 

&quot;A focused energy beam of the right sort will tear through the curtain 
of darkness that surrounds this world,&quot; he explained. &quot;But the beam 
takes a nearly unimaginable amount of energy to use, and there are 
very few Shinma who are capable of gathering that much energy 
together, let alone learning how to use it.&quot; 

&quot;HOW?&quot; she screamed out, unable to contain herself anymore. &quot;How is it 
that you claim you can do this while so many of us can barely find 
enough energy to live?&quot; 

Mephisto looked at her for a moment before he finally made his choice. 
&quot;I&#39;ll show you,&quot; he said as he gathered the two souls together in his 
hands. His body quickly dissolved into particles and formed into a 
whirling vortex. The glowing souls were drawn inside and the 
maelestrom collapsed around them, the tiny particles reforming into 
Mephisto&#39;s usual form. 

&quot;Come with me,&quot; he said as he held his hand out to her. 

She looked at his outstreched hand for a moment before she reached out 
and grasped it with her own. The world around her seemed to waver ever 
so slightly as he folded space around them, changing their location in 
an instant. Then the world became solid once again. &quot;Touch nothing,&quot; 
he warned as he released her hand and she began to look around. 

Her first impression was that they were in another small cave, but as 
she looked around she saw that they were surrounded on all sides by 
solid rock, a bubble that formed when a pocket of air was trapped in 
molten rock that later cooled. &quot;What is this place?&quot; she breathed as 
she glanced around before her eyes focused on the tiny puddle of 
incandescent water in the very center of the lava bubble. 

Mephisto said nothing as his body dissolved into the vortex and 
released the two souls. As soon as they were free the whirlwind 
collapsed and reformed around them, his hands materializing beneath 
them before they could fall to the ground. 

&quot;Have you ever heard the legends of the creation of The Dark?&quot; he said 
softly. &quot;Of a once energy-rich world forged as a prison for those cast 
out of the outside realms, enshrouded in a curtain of darkness and 
sealed with an unspeakable power to keep those entrapped from ever 
gaining their freedom?&quot; 

She nodded. &quot;Yes, I do remember the old legends, but what do they have 
to do with this place?&quot; she asked, her attention still focused on the 
glowing pool of water. &quot;And what is that glowing puddle?&quot; 

He said nothing as he too studied the pool for a moment. As they 
watched, a tiny incandescent drop of water collected on a small 
protrusion hanging off of the ceiling and dropped into the puddle. 
There was an odd sound as the drop hit the surface, creating small 
ripples that sparkled oddly in the glow of the pool. 

&quot;Remember the legends of the fountains of power that sustained the 
first inhabitants of The Dark?&quot; he said softly. He glanced over at her 
in time to see her eyes nearly triple in size with recognition. 

&quot;Impossible....&quot; she breathed. 

Mephisto smiled. &quot;You seem to have developed a sudden fondness for 
that word, my friend, but I assure you that it is not only possible, 
but standing before you.&quot; 

&quot;A mana pool?&quot; she said, her voice almost failing her. 

&quot;A puddle, really, but that does not change it&#39;s nature,&quot; he replied. 
&quot;Pure energy in liquid form. Do not touch it,&quot; he cautioned as she 
edged forward for a better look. &quot;The amount of energy collected in 
that pool would destroy you in an instant.&quot; 

&quot;How do you draw energy from it?&quot; she asked softly. 

He gestured. &quot;Catch the next drop, but do not disturb the pool,&quot; he 
said as another drop began to form on the protrusion. 

She looked up and frowned, her gaze alternating between the drop and 
the pool, trying to decide on the best method of catching the drop 
without coming any closer to the pool than she absolutely had to. 
&quot;Will the drop harm me if I drink it?&quot; she asked as an idea formed in 
her mind. 

Mephisto smiled. &quot;No, but your tongue will tingle for a few moments as 
the energy is absorbed.&quot; 

&quot;Good,&quot; she said as she tapped into her meager supply of energy. A 
small angled plane of force appeared beneath the drop just as it 
released its hold on the protrusion of rock. The drop struck the plane 
and was channeled towards her mouth, moving across the plane a great 
deal faster than she had thought it would. Her mind had barely 
registered the fact that the drop was in motion before it splashed 
across her tongue. 

The plane vanshied into nothingness and she sat back abruptly as she 
felt her mouth being turned inside out, only without any sensation of 
pain. Raw power flowed through her body, filling her energy reserves 
to a level she had only dreamed about having. She waited until her 
senses reoriented on the world around her before giving Mephisto a 
more-than-mildly surprised look. 

&quot;You call that a tingle?&quot; she said, still adjusting to the amount of 
energy she now posessed. 

He shrugged and carefully set the two souls down on the floor of the 
lava bubble. &quot;It feels like a tingle to me,&quot; he said as he closed his 
eyes and concentrated. A single drop of pure mana separated itself 
from the rest of the pool and floated towards him, landing in the 
center of his palm. 

&quot;Absorbing more than one drop at a time is dangerous,&quot; he said after 
he had absorbed the energy from the small drop. &quot;So is trying to 
absorb any more energy when your reserves are anything other than 
almost depleted.&quot; 

She reached out and carefully picked up the dark green sphere that was 
Pluto&#39;s soul. &quot;So now what do we do with them?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;I have an idea, but we must talk to them first,&quot; he replied as he 
picked up Uranus&#39;s soul and studied it. He then moved over next to her 
so the two souls could be in close contact with one another. 

&lt;Who&#39;s there?&gt; Uranus asked. 

&lt;Just us,&gt; Mephisto consoled her. &lt;We needed to move to another 
location for a short period of time.&gt; 

&lt;Where are we?&gt; Pluto asked. &lt;I.... I feel.... something....&gt; 

&lt;We are next to a large source of pure energy,&gt; Mephisto explained. 

&lt;I assume you have some sort of idea in mind as to what you are going 
to do with us?&gt; Uranus asked hopefully. 

&lt;Be nice, Alex,&gt; Pluto chided her. 

&lt;Sorry, Sue, but this.... state of being is starting to get to me,&gt; 
Uranus apologized. &lt;That, and I want to find Michelle so we can get 
out of here.&gt; 

&lt;I do have an idea, but I am not sure if it&#39;ll work,&gt; Mephisto said 
and began to explain his idea. 

&lt;Lovely,&gt; Uranus said. &lt;So what happens to us if this doesn&#39;t work?&gt; 

Mephisto sighed quietly. &lt;Your souls may be overwhelmed by the energy, 
and quite possibly destroyed.&gt; 

&lt;Thank you, but no,&gt; Uranus immediately replied. &lt;I&#39;ll stick with 
being a lightbulb, if you don&#39;t mind.&gt; 

&lt;What&#39;s a lightbulb?&gt; the mysterious Shinma asked softly. 

&lt;You may test your theory on me,&gt; Pluto said. 

&lt;Sue, have you lost your mind?&gt; Uranus said. &lt;You could die in that.&gt; 

&lt;If you want to be literal, Alex, I lost my mind when I lost my body,&gt; 
Pluto replied with amusement. &lt;As for being killed, we&#39;re as good as 
dead anyway if we stay like this, provided we don&#39;t go insane first.&gt; 

Uranus&#39;s reply was a phrase that Pluto understood perfectly, Mephisto 
had a passing understanding of, and was totally new to the other 
Shinma. All three of them, however, had no difficulty discerning the 
approximate meaning of the phrase. 

&lt;Does Michelle know what comes out of that mouth?&gt; Pluto said mildly. 

&lt;Stuff it, Sue.&gt; 

&lt;Let me know when you are ready to proceed,&gt; Mephisto said evenly. 

&lt;I am ready,&gt; Pluto replied. 

&lt;You&#39;re nuts, Sue,&gt; Uranus grumbled. 

Mephisto declined to try to translate Uranus&#39;s meaning. &quot;Hold her,&quot; he 
said as he held out Uranus&#39;s soul. She took the yellow ball of light 
and passed him the dark green ball that was Pluto&#39;s soul. 

&lt;Your friend is most interesting,&gt; he said as he carried the soul to 
the edge of the mana pool. 

&lt;You seem to like her well enough,&gt; Pluto replied. 

He paused in mid-motion, but only for an imperceptible instant. &lt;You 
say that with the utmost certainty,&gt; he said, mildly amused. 

&lt;Call it a gift of insight,&gt; she replied. &lt;That, and I doubt you would 
be helping us if you didn&#39;t like us in some manner or another.&gt; 

He laughed softly as he knelt down. &lt;That is true, Pluto, but I do 
have other reasons. Are you ready?&gt; 

&lt;Yes.&gt; 

Mephisto closed his eyes and concentrated. The glowing ball rose up 
from his hands by an unseen force and slowly floated over to the 
center of the pool. Good luck, my friend, he thought to himself as he 
shifted his concentration and the glowing ball became submerged in the 
mana pool. He watched as the glowing ball began to glow brighter for a 
moment, then abruptly exploded outward into a mass of tiny luminescent 
particles that dispersed into the pool. 

He heard a sharp gasp behind him and felt his own breath catch in his 
chest. I&#39;m sorry.... he thought to himself as he closed his eyes, 
saddened by the unexpected destruction. 

&quot;Is she...?&quot; he heard her say. 

He tried to speak but his voice failed him, and he could do nothing 
but sit still as the sadness and guilt threatened to overwhelm him. 

&quot;Look!&quot; she said suddenly. 

He opened his eyes and blinked. The tiny particles were slowly 
emerging from the mana pool and lazily drifting around the confines of 
the lava bubble. As they watched, the particles started to come 
together to form a mishappen glowing mass. 

&quot;Interesting....&quot; he heard himself saying aloud. 

The glowing shape began to glow brighter as more of the particles 
merged with it. When the last of the particles was absorbed by the 
glowing mass, the lava bubble was suddenly filled with a blinding 
light, forcing the Shinma to briefly alter their physical forms to 
protect their vision. 

Mephisto waited until he could no longer see the inside of his 
eyelids, counted to twenty, and slowly opened his eyes. When they were 
able to focus properly, he looked around the room and blinked in 
surprise. 

&quot;Pluto?&quot; he asked softly. 

The figure was lying on her side, appearing to be just like any other 
nude human female with dark green hair that flowed gracefully down to 
the small of her back. The only difference between her and any of the 
other human females Mephisto had ever seen in his lifetime was the 
pair of large, batlike wings emerging from her back and neatly folded 
behind her. 

She stirred slightly as she started to regain consciousness, her arms 
and legs moving slowly in response to commands from her 
still-awakening mind. The wings on her back flexed experimentally for 
a few seconds before trying to spread out, the one wing smacking 
against the side of the lava bubble and eliciting a soft grunt from 
her. 

A sudden memory bubbled up from Mephisto&#39;s mind and he blinked. 
&quot;Change your form,&quot; he whispered to the other Shinma as his body 
started to change into the humanoid form he had used during his brief 
visit to the outside realm. 

&quot;What?&quot; she said, confused at both the sudden development and 
Mephisto&#39;s surprising request. 

&quot;For some reason, our natural forms terrify humans,&quot; he said as his 
body solidified. &quot;Change into something they can recognize before she 
wakes up.&quot; 

Susan grunted softly again as she rolled over onto her stomach and 
lifted her head up, her eyelids trying valiantly to open. They had 
only partially succeeded when the image of a hideous, shapeless mass 
wandered into her line of vision. 

Eh? she thought as she blinked rapidly, trying to wake up enough to 
get a good look at the being and hence identify it. A small tendril 
reached out from the mass and brushed across her forehead, sending a 
decidedly unpleasant chill down her spine. 

Shinma? her thought fuzzily for a moment before the dark mass in front 
of her started to waver, causing her to forget her initial thought and 
to worry about what was going on. The wavering solidifed into a small 
figure and she blinked, not believing what her eyes were telling her. 

Summoning a strength she wasn&#39;t sure she possessed, she rolled over 
and sat up, one hand reaching out to steady herself against the wall 
as her world started to spin briefly with the effort. She waited until 
all of the double images had vanished before she looked around her. 

There was a small glowing pool a few feet away from her and a strange 
but handsome looking man was kneeling at the edge, looking at her with 
open curiosity. Sitting on the ground next to him was a yellowish ball 
of light that glowed softly from within. And right in front of her was 
a small gray kitten with a golden crescent mark on its forehead. 

Her memory immediately flashed back to her first few years in the Moon 
Kingdom and the small lunar kitten that she had adopted. She had often 
gotten the impression that the kitten had adopted her, but she never 
bothered to argue the semantics of the issue. And now that very same 
kitten appeared to be sitting in front of her, looking at her with 
those ever-curious pale red eyes, just as she always used to when 
confronted with something strange. 

Impossible, Susan thought. This isn&#39;t possible. But.... 

&quot;Myst?&quot; she asked softly. 

The kitten blinked and shook her head slowly. &quot;I am not the kitten you 
once knew. I only took her form to spare you the sight of my normal 
form, which I am told causes distress to those who view it.&quot; 

Susan blinked. The kitten&#39;s voice sounded exactly as her memories told 
her it should, which brought her a small measure of discomfort. 
&quot;You&#39;re the one who found me,&quot; she said, saying it as a statement 
rather than a question. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied softly. 

&quot;I am grateful, of course,&quot; Susan said as she sat back on her heels 
and absently flexed her wings, &quot;But you still haven&#39;t told me your 
name yet.&quot; 

&quot;The knowledge of my true-name commands great power over me, and so I 
must keep it a secret,&quot; the lunar kitten replied almost sadly. 

&quot;It is difficult to thank someone without a name,&quot; Susan said 
pointedly. 

The kitten tilted her head at an angle, unconsciously acting as a real 
lunar kitten would. &quot;What did you call me a few moments ago?&quot; she 
asked. 

&quot;Myst. That was the name of the kitten I had back in the Moon 
Kingdom.&quot; 

&quot;Myst,&quot; the kitten repeated softly. &quot;It sounds like a nice name.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you for saving my life, Myst,&quot; Susan said softly. She then 
looked up towards the figure still kneeling by the edge of the 
strangely glowing pool of water. &quot;And you must be Mephisto. You have 
my thanks as well.&quot; 

He nodded his head. &quot;I am, and you are more than welcome, Pluto.&quot; 

Susan shook her head. &quot;My name is Susan. Sailor Pluto is my name when 
I am in avatar form.&quot; 

Both Myst and Mephisto shrank back slightly at the mention of the 
word. &quot;Avatar?&quot; Mephisto whispered, then nodded to himself. &quot;I was 
wondering why a human had wings.&quot; 

Susan&#39;s wings flexed slightly before they folded flat against her back 
and were suddenly absorbed into her skin, leaving only a pair of 
dark-colored scars behind that stretched from the base of her shoulder 
blades down to the small of her back. &quot;I have wings for a different 
reason, not because I am an avatar,&quot; she said simply. Her gaze fell to 
the glowing ball next to Mephisto and she frowned slightly. &quot;Is that 
Alex&#39;s soul?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Mephisto said as he picked up the soul. He studied the 
glowing ball for a few moments before he held it out over the mana 
pool and began to concentrate. 

&quot;Susan, do not interfere with what happens, and whatever you do, do 
not touch the pool,&quot; Mephisto said evenly as Uranus&#39;s soul slowly 
floated up out of his hand and moved over the center of the pool. 

Susan watched with mild interest as the glowing ball hovered over the 
incandescent surface of the pool for a brief moment before plunging 
into the center of it. As she watched, the yellow soul began to glow 
brighter for a moment, then abruptly disintegrated into a multitude of 
tiny glowing particles. 

&quot;Alex!&quot; Susan yelped in surprise and started to lean forward. She 
yelped again as two sets of claws raked across her bare thigh as Myst 
tried to hold her back. 

&quot;Susan, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s supposed to do that,&quot; Myst said quickly. 

Susan blinked and brushed a stray lock of dark green hair out of her 
line of vision. &quot;Okay....&quot; she said slowly as she looked at the dark 
red blood slowly seeping from the claw marks on her thigh. &quot;Thank you 
for telling me that, but you didn&#39;t have to claw me to do it,&quot; she 
said somewhat archly. 

Myst blinked in surprise, first looking at the marks on Susan&#39;s skin 
and the blood seeping from them, then at her paws. She flexed them 
experimentally and nearly jumped in surprise when claws slid out from 
between the pads of what passed for her fingers. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I.... I didn&#39;t know I had these....&quot; Myst apologized. 

&quot;Susan, look,&quot; Mephisto said quietly. 

Everyone&#39;s attention went to the pool and to the mass of tiny sparkles 
slowly emerging from the depths. Very slowly, the particles floated up 
out of the pool and started to merge into a rather mishappen form near 
the wall of the lava bubble. The mass started to grow brighter and 
brighter as more and more of the tiny particles merged together. As 
soon as all of the particles had finished merging, the glowing form 
gave off a blinding burst of light. 

Susan waited impatiently for her retinas to quit burning before she 
tried opening her eyes. They opened, but it took her a second to 
realize that she wasn&#39;t seeing anything because they were still 
recovering from the temporary overload. The blindness quickly passed 
and she looked around to see what the result had been. 

The figure was lying on her side, almost exactly as Susan had been 
when she first woke up. The only clues to her identity was the 
close-cut blonde hair and the nearly invisible network of scars 
criss-crossing her bare leg, scars that had resulted from her having 
lost a fight with a lunar cat that hadn&#39;t liked being picked up while 
napping. 

Susan quickly moved over next to her side, looking her over for any 
sign of illness or injury. &quot;Alex?&quot; she asked softly as she carefully 
shook the blonde&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;Gwuh,&quot; was the fuzzy and indistinct reply as Alex started to regain 
most of her senses. She took a deep breath and tried to open her eyes, 
giving up after a few seconds when she realized that it was going to 
take more effort than she was currently capable of putting out. 

Susan began to breathe again when she saw Alex&#39;s muscles slowly start 
to respond to what her semi-unconscious brain was telling them. &quot;Wake 
up, Alex. Do it slowly so you don&#39;t strain anything, but wake up,&quot; 
Susan said softly as she brushed the hair off of Alex&#39;s face. 

&quot;Mergh,&quot; Alex grunted as she started to wake up. She focused her mind 
and managed to succeed in rolling over onto her back. &quot;Mich, what did 
you do with the pillows?&quot; she muttered to herself as she pressed her 
hands to her forehead. 

&quot;Does she always wake up like that?&quot; Mephisto asked softly from behind 
Susan&#39;s shoulder, watching Alex with mild interest. 

Susan cast a mildly reproving look over her shoulder. &quot;I don&#39;t know, I 
usually don&#39;t sleep next to her,&quot; she said. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sleeping, honest,&quot; Alex grunted as her eyes fluttered open. 

&quot;Don&#39;t try to get up yet,&quot; Susan said as she held her hand against 
Alex&#39;s chest, preventing her from trying to sit up. &quot;Give your body 
another few minutes to get your blood circulating properly.&quot; 

&quot;Yuck, why do I feel like last week&#39;s roadkill?&quot; the blonde moaned. 
&quot;And I&#39;m not going any where, Sue, so you can get your hand out from 
between my tits.&quot; 

The corners of Susan&#39;s mouth twitched in amusement as she removed her 
hand from Alex&#39;s chest. &quot;I see you haven&#39;t changed much, despite our 
ordeal,&quot; she observed lightly. 

Alex flexed her fingers briefly, wincing at the slight stiffness in 
the joints. &quot;Are you sure we&#39;ve been alive all this time? Feels like 
I&#39;ve been dead for at least a month, maybe two.&quot; Her blue eyes 
suddenly darted to the side to look into Susan&#39;s dark red eyes. &quot;How 
long have we been like that?&quot; 

Susan sighed quietly. &quot;You don&#39;t want to know.&quot; 

&quot;Sue, how long?&quot; Alex in a flat tone that Susan knew she only used 
when she wanted an answer and wouldn&#39;t rest until she got one. 

&quot;Perhaps you should worry more about yourself and your missing friend 
first,&quot; Mephisto said quietly. &quot;After all, how long you were in that 
state is something you can discuss once you are safely back home.&quot; 

Alex craned her head back to look at who was talking. After a few 
seconds of futile effort, she took a deep breath and forced herself 
into a sitting position, ignoring Susan&#39;s cautioning look. She flexed 
her shoulders for a moment before turning around to see who it was. 

Her eyes met Mephisto&#39;s and she felt her body suddenly become ever so 
slightly warmer. Hello.... she thought slowly to herself as she was 
briefly taken aback by how handsome he looked. Then the little voice 
in the back of her mind told her to do a quick check because something 
felt out of place. The slightest flexing of her spine was all it took 
to tell her that she wasn&#39;t wearing any clothes. 

Susan&#39;s delicate eyebrows rose as Alex&#39;s skin abruptly flushed a 
medium shade of crimson and she sat back, folding her legs at an angle 
in front of her and crossing her arms over her breasts. Susan knew 
that she wasn&#39;t wearing any clothing either, but had long ago ceased 
to have the slightest concern about modesty in most situations. 

Mephisto blinked at Alex&#39;s unexpected reaction before he remembered 
the human culture&#39;s rules about clothing. He had included clothing in 
his own changed appearance out of reflex rather than thought. I&#39;ll fix 
that in a bit, he thought to himself, but first things are first.... 

&quot;Forgive me for not introducing myself,&quot; he said as he stood up and 
bowed his head in Alex&#39;s direction. &quot;My name is Mephisto.&quot; 

&quot;Alex Ten&#39;ou,&quot; Alex replied as she shifted positions slightly, her 
cheeks still burning with embarrasment and shame. 

&quot;Alex,&quot; he repeated softly. &quot;Forgive me, but that does not sound like 
a proper name for someone as beautiful as you.&quot; 

Susan cast a sidelong glance at Alex and noted the deeping of her 
blush. Interesting, she thought to herself before she turned her 
attention back to Mephisto. &quot;Her name is actually Alexis, but she 
prefers to use the shortened version for some reason,&quot; Susan said 
calmly, ignoring the dark glare from Alex that her words produced. 

&quot;Alexis,&quot; Mephisto repeated with a soft smile. &quot;Alexis sounds so much 
more pleasing to the ear than the shortened pronounciation,&quot; he said 
slowly. 

&quot;Thanks a lot, Sue,&quot; Alex whispered out of the corner of her mouth, 
her skin darkening yet another shade of red. Susan gave her an amused 
look in response and Alex softly blew her breath out in frustration. 
She looked up suddenly as Mephisto coughed lightly. 

&quot;Please excuse my lack of manners, Alexis, for your beauty has been 
quite a distraction for one such as I,&quot; Mephisto said as he walked 
over to her. &quot;If you would stand for a moment...?&quot; he asked as he held 
his hand out. 

Alex&#39;s eyes went wide as she started to worry what he had in mind. She 
looked over at Susan and saw her nod slightly at her. Oh, great, Alex 
thought. Here I am, butt-naked in the middle of god-knows-where, some 
really cute guy with a sexy voice wants to dance with me, I&#39;m naked, 
mind you, and Susan is telling me to go for it. Of all the insanity 
I&#39;ve been through in the past half-hour.... 

She took a deep breath as she reached out to grasp his hand. He 
carefully helped her to her feet and looked into her eyes. Whoa, and I 
thought Sailor Mars had deep eyes.... she thought breathlessly as she 
gazed into his seemingly bottomless black eyes for a moment. 

&quot;Hiding beauty such as yours is a crime,&quot; he said softly to her, &quot;But 
when beauty is hidden behind more beauty, there is no injustice in 
that....&quot; He then brought her hand to his lips and kissed it. 

Alex blinked as her skin started to tingle, then gasped as her hand 
was surrounded in a soft glow. The glow started to spread up across 
her arm, then quickly across the rest of her body. Her skin started to 
tingle for a brief moment before the glow faded and she looked down, 
not believing her eyes. 

She was now dressed in a shimmering white gown, looking almost exactly 
like one of the gowns she used to wear for ballroom dancing back on 
the Moon Kingdom. &quot;Nice....&quot; she breathed as she took a step back and 
ran her fingers over the silken fabric. She blinked as she realized 
she was now wearing white shoes along with elbow-length white gloves. 
&quot;Very nice....&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Susan said as she stood up and moved next to Alex. 
&quot;You either are an excellent tailor or have visited the Queen&#39;s 
Ballroom during one of her diplomatic functions,&quot; she said evenly. 

&quot;I&#39;m honored to say that I&#39;ve visited your kingdom once, although it 
was quite some time ago,&quot; he replied as he held out his hand to Susan. 
&quot;I assume you have the same fashion preference?&quot; 

&quot;I would prefer something in black, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; she replied as 
she gracefully took his hand in hers. 

&quot;There you go again, always gotta be a dark spot,&quot; Alex muttered. She 
blinked in surprise as Susan&#39;s hand began to glow. Fascinated, she 
watched as the glow spread across her body and solidified into a 
jet-black evening gown, one more suited to quiet nights on a moonlit 
terrace rather than festive nights dancing on a ballroom floor. 

Susan looked down at her dress and nodded her head in approval. &quot;Thank 
you, this is just what I had in mind.&quot; 

Mephisto smiled. &quot;I am glad to be of service,&quot; he said as he released 
Susan&#39;s hand. 

&quot;And who might you be?&quot; Alex asked as she crouched down to get a 
better look at Myst. 

&quot;My name is Myst,&quot; the Shinma replied. 

&quot;How&#39;d you wind up here?&quot; Alex asked as she carefully picked up what 
she thought was a lunar cat. &quot;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d find YEOUCH!&quot; she 
yelped as she released her hold on Myst and examined the claw marks on 
the underside of her arm. 

Susan sighed. &quot;When will you learn to ask before you pick up a cat?&quot; 
She decided to ignore Alex&#39;s rather profane suggestion and knelt down 
to examine Myst. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; 

Myst&#39;s whiskers twitched as she examined her hind paws. &quot;I thought I 
was slipping so I tried to get into a better position. I didn&#39;t think 
I had claws there as well.&quot; She looked up at Alex apologetically. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t mean to scratch you like that,&quot; she said softly. 

&quot;Ah, what&#39;s a few more scars?&quot; Alex said as she examined the cuts. The 
back of her mind was working on something, however, and quickly 
presented its problem to the rest of her consciousness. She froze in 
mid-motion and looked at Myst. &quot;Umm.... you&#39;re not a lunar cat, are 
you?&quot; 

Myst shook her head. &quot;This is only a guise, as my normal form would be 
highly disturbing to your species.&quot; 

Alex blinked and exchanged a mildly concerned look with Susan. 
&quot;And.... ah, if you don&#39;t mind.... what exactly are you, then?&quot; 

Myst&#39;s tail twitched briefly as she tried learning how to manipulate 
it. &quot;Shinma,&quot; she said simply. Both her and Mephisto were surprised 
when Susan hissed in shock and pulled Alex behind her, dropping into a 
defensive stance in the process. 

&quot;Whoa, Sue, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Alex quickly asked nervously. 

&quot;Both of you are Shinma?&quot; Susan asked flatly, her red eyes narrowed. 

Mephisto blinked as a puzzle piece fell into place and things started 
to make sense. &quot;You&#39;re a demon, aren&#39;t you?&quot; he asked softly. 

&quot;Demon?&quot; Myst hissed, her fur sticking straight out in a reflex. 

Susan winced as Alex put her fingers to her mouth and made a very loud 
whistling noise. &quot;Everyone hold it for a few moments,&quot; the blonde 
growled. She waited until everyone seemed to calm down slightly before 
she continued. &quot;Okay, will someone kindly tell me just what the hell 
is going on here?&quot; 

&quot;If I may?&quot; Susan asked evenly. Mephisto made a gesture and she took a 
deep breath. &quot;According to ancient legends, when the Underworld was 
forged out of Chaos to house the souls of the dead, there were those 
who sought to usurp power from Hades so that they may wield control 
over the souls and use their powers for their own purposes. Hades 
fought back against the uprising and forged a prison out of the 
remaining pieces of Chaos. The prison was made so that any who entered 
could never escape, and it was into this neo-void that he threw those 
who tried to take control away from him. Those demons who were 
condemned in this manner were called Shinma.&quot; 

Mephisto nodded. &quot;You know the legends well.&quot; 

&quot;It is always a good idea to know what one must often travel to,&quot; 
Susan replied in a cryptic tone as she continued to glare at Mephisto. 

Mephisto regarded her carefully. &quot;Myst and I are indeed Shinma, but 
only in name. Our ancestors were the ones cast out from the 
Underworld, but they continued to exist here and have spawned many 
offspring. Neither Myst nor myself have committed any sort of crimes 
against the Underworld, but we remain trapped here nevertheless, along 
with others who have.&quot; 

Susan&#39;s defensive posture wavered for a few moments before she relaxed 
and let her arms fall to her sides. &quot;I assume we are in The Dark, 
then?&quot; 

&quot;We are,&quot; Mephisto said simply. &quot;I&#39;m curious, Susan. Alexis appears to 
be entirely human, but you are not. Are both of you avatars?&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s an avatar?&quot; Alex whispered in Susan&#39;s ear, confused at the 
sudden turn of events. 

&quot;Yes, but we serve different gods,&quot; Susan replied. 

Alex sighed and sat down on the ground before her head started to spin 
from confusion. She looked up to find Myst sitting next to her. &quot;Do 
you have any idea what they&#39;re talking about?&quot; she asked the kitten, 
picking her up and putting her in her lap without thinking about it. 

&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Myst sighed. 

&quot;And what sort of demon are you, if I may ask?&quot; Mephisto asked 
quietly. 

Susan gave him a mild look. &quot;I have the blood of a demon in my veins, 
and aside from being able to manifest the wings of a demon, I am 
otherwise just as human as Alex is.&quot; 

Mephisto decided not to press the issue, instead turning to stare into 
the incandescent pool of mana. &quot;It matters not,&quot; he said softly after 
a moment. 

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Alex grumbled as she stood up, making sure she kept a 
solid hold on Myst. &quot;The next person to say something I don&#39;t 
understand gets their toes stomped on.&quot; 

Mephisto looked over at Susan in time to see her rolling her eyes. &quot;Am 
I to assume she is always this.... forceful?&quot; he said softly. 

Susan nodded. &quot;You should see her when she&#39;s really angry.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m about to get that way unless someone starts talking,&quot; Alex 
growled. &quot;First off, someone needs to tell me what the problem is 
between you two. Second, it&#39;s getting a little stuffy in here, so I 
suggest we start looking for a way out of this rat-trap. And third, we 
need to find Michelle and make sure she&#39;s okay so we can get out of 
this place and back to the kingdom.&quot; 

Susan and Mephisto looked at each other. &quot;We do need to find your 
friend and get you out of here,&quot; Mephisto said softly. &quot;If any of the 
other Shinma learn of your presence here, it would present an 
immediate and probably fatal problem.&quot; 

&quot;Why would you help us now that you know who we are?&quot; Susan asked 
softly. 

Mephisto looked over at Alex and said nothing. Susan glanced over to 
the blonde and saw her blush faintly under the sudden scrutiny. She 
looked back at Mephisto and regarded him very carefully. 

&quot;Suffice it to say that I have my reasons and leave it at that,&quot; he 
said finally as he turned back to look at her. 

&quot;How long have you watched over her soul?&quot; Susan asked, speaking soft 
enough so only he could hear her. 

&quot;Well over eight hundred years,&quot; Mephisto replied, equally as soft. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know why I bothered to do so for so long, to be honest, but I am 
most.... gratified that I did.&quot; 

&quot;Can we trust you?&quot; Susan asked. 

Mephisto laughed humorlessly. &quot;Come now, how would I profit from your 
demise? Vengeance? Justice? Why should I keep you captive? To use for 
my pleasure? Amusement? No, demon,&quot; he said as he shook his head, 
&quot;Despite what your god has done to us, I have no reason to harm you in 
any way.&quot; 

&quot;That is not what I asked.&quot; 

&quot;Sue, will you get that weed out of your butt and calm down?&quot; Alex 
said with a sigh. &quot;Mephisto, will you help us find Michelle and get 
out of here?&quot; 

Mephisto nodded at her. &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. 

&quot;Great, thanks,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;Now then, unless you and 
Susan want to continue your game of verbal fencing, can we find a way 
out of here? This puddle is pretty to look at, but we really need to 
find Michelle.&quot; 

Mephisto glanced out of the corner of his eye and watched Susan roll 
her eyes again. She muttered something cryptic beneath her breath 
about Alex&#39;s hair color and sighed before glancing over at him 
questioningly. 

&quot;You humans are strange,&quot; Myst observed as Alex absently scratched her 
behind the ears. 

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Susan said, then grunted as Alex stomped on her 
foot. 

&quot;You hush,&quot; Alex said acidly. 

&quot;The only way out of here is to use dimensional teleportation,&quot; 
Mephisto said with a light cough. &quot;If you will take my hand....&quot; 

Alex made sure she had a tight grip on Myst before she reached out and 
firmly took hold of the offered hand. Susan sighed quietly to herself 
and did the same after giving Mephisto a neutral look. 

The air around them seemed to ripple ever so slightly as space started 
to fold around them in a complex quasi-geometrical shape and they 
simply vanished. Space unfolded itself back to normal and the only 
motion left in the tiny lava bubble was the gentle rippling of the 
surface of the mana pool. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

It&#39;s amazing how fast people will either do their job or get out of 
your way if you growl loud enough, Rune thought to herself as she 
walked down the corridor at a fast pace, flanked on both sides by 
heavily armed bodyguards. She covered the distance between Si&#39;ren&#39;s 
quarters and the command center in what she thought was record time, 
not happy in the least at being disturbed at such a late hour. 

&quot;Status report,&quot; she snapped as she strode into the large room, the 
guards taking up mildly unobtrusive positions on either side of the 
main doors. 

The lieutenant at the main communications console looked up at her and 
motioned her over, most of her attention still focused on what was 
happening in the communication network. &quot;TacSat 31, Control. Repeat 
your last message, I say again, repeat your last message, over,&quot; she 
said into her headset as she turned on an external speaker. 

&quot;Control, TacSat 31,&quot; came the static-filled voice over the speaker. 
&quot;We have visual confirmation of a rift opening over the Hinterland 
region. Ground radar is being jammed by an energy field. We estimate 
the rift to be half a mile in length. Request further instructions, 
over.&quot; 

&quot;This plugged into the network?&quot; Rune asked as she picked up a spare 
headset and put it on. 

&quot;One second, ma&#39;am,&quot; the lieutenant said as she pressed a few buttons 
on her console. &quot;It&#39;s active now.&quot; 

&quot;Network, Rune,&quot; the general said into the microphone. &quot;Scenario team, 
please respond, over.&quot; 

&quot;Rune, red team, over.&quot; 

&quot;Rune, blue team, over.&quot; 

&quot;Rune, green team, over.&quot; 

&quot;Rune, black team, over.&quot; 

Rune nodded her head in satisfaction at the prompt reply she received. 
&quot;Scenario team, Rune. This may be what we discussed, so be ready for 
whatever comes through that rift. Is everyone clear on the assignment, 
over?&quot; 

&quot;Rune, black team,&quot; said a voice over the speaker. &quot;We will take point 
and green will provide back-up. Red and blue will provide contingency 
cover. Any further instructions before we go silent, over?&quot; 

&quot;Black team, Rune. Negative, instructions stand. Good luck. Out,&quot; Rune 
said and turned off the headset. 

&quot;And you said you hated welcome parties,&quot; a soft voice purred from 
behind General Rune&#39;s shoulder. 

Rune turned around to give Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren a mild look. &quot;Who said 
anything about a party? Or a welcome, for that matter,&quot; Rune added 
with a slight edge to her voice. 

Si&#39;ren opened her mouth to reply but closed it again when the control 
room doors opened to admit Dragoon Commander K&#39;tal and Psi-Corp 
Captain Ael&#39;ien. &quot;Forgive a stupid question, General Rune, but have 
you heard the latest report from the Hinterland region?&quot; Ael&#39;ien asked 
without preamble. 

Rune ran her fingers through her dark hair for a moment before 
responding. &quot;If you&#39;re referring to the rift, Captain, I assure you 
I&#39;m well aware of it,&quot; she said slowly and evenly. 

K&#39;tal and Ael&#39;ien exchanged concerned glances. &quot;Begging the general&#39;s 
pardon, but that rift is only half the problem,&quot; K&#39;tal said slowly. 

General Rune frowned, a small tingle of unease crawling down her 
spine. &quot;So what&#39;s the other problem?&quot; 

&quot;Intelligence has reason to believe that there is a rogue unit 
deployed in the Hinterland region, one that isn&#39;t under your control,&quot; 
K&#39;tal explained. &quot;We think it might belong to the remains of General 
Malachite&#39;s forces, but we&#39;re not absolutely certain.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren took a small step forward, a dark frown crossing her otherwise 
delicate features. &quot;So what can this rogue unit do?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Shoot down whatever tries to come through the rift,&quot; Ael&#39;ien stated. 
&quot;Or if not, at least inflict a large quantity of damage on it. Either 
way, the person in charge of those forces is going to get royally 
pissed off.&quot; 

&quot;Great,&quot; Rune growled. 

&quot;Control, TacSat 31!&quot; came the excited voice from the speakers. &quot;We 
have a visual of something coming through the rift! What did you say 
it was? Umm, stand by, control....&quot; 

Rune and Si&#39;ren moved over to the main display screen console. &quot;Give 
me an overhead projection of that area, now,&quot; Rune said to the room in 
general. There was a brief pause before the screen lit up, showing a 
topographical map of the immediate region around the Hinterland area. 
Several dozen lights lit up, each represeting units deployed around 
the area. A large, jagged black line represented the rift and a 
relatively sizable white dot was starting to form in the center of the 
rift. 

&quot;Control, TacSat 31. Object is identified as an airborne carrier, old 
Vresh&#39;tan class, designate target as avatar one. Sensory units still 
being jammed by the rift. Target is moving slowly at an estimated 
twelve miles per hour, bearing two seven zero, altitude estimated to 
be fourteen angels,&quot; the voice said slowly. 

&quot;How old is the Vresh&#39;tan class of carriers?&quot; Rune asked over her left 
shoulder, her eyes glued to the screen. 

K&#39;tal blinked. &quot;At least four thousand years old, General,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Might be closer to five, depending on what particular model they&#39;re 
using.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren made a soft grunting noise. &quot;Nop&#39;tera deployed her forces 
around that time, correct?&quot; 

&quot;I think so,&quot; Rune replied quietly. &quot;If I remember right, they were on 
the leading edge of the airborne carrier technology at the time and 
she took five of those things with her.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren blinked. &quot;Five carriers?&quot; she breathed, knowing the full 
firepower potential of the naval equivalent. 

&quot;Didn&#39;t one of them come back crippled a thousand years ago?&quot; Ael&#39;ien 
said. &quot;Something about an internal reactor explosion?&quot; 

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Rune said, still intently watching the white 
blip on the display screen. 

&quot;Transient, transient!&quot; a voice screamed over the communications 
network. &quot;Missile transient, ground-based missile fired, it looks to 
be headed towards the carrier!&quot; 

Rune&#39;s head snapped up to look at the speaker as she let loose with a 
very inventive string of profanity. &quot;You, get on every frequency you 
can and warn the carrier off. And tell those trigger-happy bastards to 
hold their fire!&quot; Rune snapped at the lieutenant. 

&quot;Network, TacSat 12, tracking missile with auxiliary system,&quot; said 
another voice over the network. &quot;Missile is live and tracking avatar 
one. Avatar one has increased speed to approximately seventy-five 
miles per hour and is trying to increase altitude....&quot; 

&quot;Network, ComPost 3, I want to know who fired that p&#39;tahk&#39;enn thing!&quot; 

&quot;ComPost 3, MisBat 1, all missiles grounded, over.&quot; 

&quot;ComPost 3, MisBat 4, ditto, over.&quot; 

&quot;ComPost 3, MisBat 2, ordinance still accounted for, over.&quot; 

&quot;Network, TacSat 12, time to impact seven seconds. Avatar one now at 
twenty-three angels and still climbing.&quot; 

&quot;ComPost 3, MisBat 3, all weapons visually accounted for, over.&quot; 

&quot;Network, TacSat 12.... missile strike confirmed, avatar one is 
hit.... Maintaining position at twenty-five angels, forward velocity 
now zero.... Transient, missile transient from avatar one!&quot; 

&quot;They&#39;re firing?&quot; Si&#39;ren said incrediously. &quot;On what?&quot; 

Rune said nothing, watching the chaos unfold on her display screen, 
her face a blank mask of controlled emotions and reactions. 

&quot;Postman! Postman! Postman!&quot; a voice started screaming on the network. 

&quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi,&quot; K&#39;tal breathed, his eyes going wide in utter shock. 

Rune&#39;s body started to shake. &quot;She didn&#39;t.....&quot; she whispered. 

&quot;Everyone get down!&quot; the voice continued to scream. &quot;Get down n......&quot; 

Everyone stared at the display screen in mute shock as the speaker 
started to emit a high-pitched tone and a large red blotch appeared on 
the screen. The lieutenant at the communications console quickly 
switched over to a different frequency and the speaker fell completely 
silent, save for the usual static hissing. 

&quot;Network, control, all units respond, over,&quot; she said into her 
headset. 

&quot;General Rune....&quot; Ael&#39;ien said quietly. 

&quot;Network, control.... All units respond, over....&quot; 

Rune held up one hand and the telepath fell silent, everyone still 
waiting to hear a response from the units deployed in the Hinterland 
region. 

&quot;Network, control.... All units please respond, over....&quot; 

&quot;...ntrol... at 31, s.... ain, over.... ra.... ference....&quot; 

&quot;TacSat 31, control, your signal is breaking up, please signal again.&quot; 

&quot;...ol, TacS.... witching to.... ncy two one f.... ay again, we.... 
hing to frequ.... one five....&quot; 

The silence in the control room made everyone&#39;s skin crawl with 
tension, yet they remained quiet as they listened to the fragmented 
broadcast from the tactical satellite transmitter. The lieutenant&#39;s 
concentration was absolute as she worked, her only concern was trying 
to re-establish the link. 

&quot;Switching to frequency 215,&quot; she reported as she worked. &quot;TacSat 31, 
control, please respond, over.&quot; 

&quot;..ntrol, TacSat 3.... clear detonation confir.... say again, nuclear 
deton.... nfirmed. Radiation.... fering with transmission, I sa.... 
ain, the radi.... is interfering with transm.... ver....&quot; 

General Rune stood up straight and slowly walked over next to the 
young lieutenant. She picked up the headset and put it on, momentarily 
giving the communications officer a comforting squeeze on her 
shoulder. 

&quot;TacSat 31, Rune, do you copy, over?&quot; the general said into the 
headset. 

&quot;Rune, TacSat 31, transmi.... s shaky, but.... opy, over.&quot; 

&quot;TacSat 31, evacuate the region and report to the nearest emergency 
radiation fallout shelter,&quot; Rune said, her voice a flat monotone. 

&quot;Rune, Ta.... 1, negative,&quot; replied the voice almost sadly. &quot;Rad count 
is over four five zero, it wouldn&#39;t.... us any good anyway. Request 
per.... to continue broadcast, over.&quot; 

Rune sighed and closed her eyes, knowing that any radiation dose of 
over three hundred points was fatal to denizens. &quot;Commander K&#39;tal,&quot; 
she said as she turned off the microphone, &quot;I want the names of 
everyone in TacSat 31. Their sacrifice will not go unrecognized.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll see to it myself,&quot; K&#39;tal replied softly. 

Rune nodded and turned the microphone back on. &quot;TacSat 31, Rune. You 
have permission to continue broadcast as long as possible, over.&quot; 

&quot;Rune, TacSat 31, we copy. Avatar one is maintaining previous position 
at twenty-five angels, no forward velocity.... New contact emerging 
from the rift, designate target avatar two. Moving at an estimated 
fifteen miles per hour bearing two seven three, altitude at an 
estimated fourteen angels....&quot; 

The communication officer&#39;s head snapped up suddenly and she frowned 
as a message relayed itself through her headset. &quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren, 
flash report from Leviathan North. The shockwave from the blast has 
disturbed an undersea lava vent right beneath it and the vent is going 
active. External water temperature has risen twenty degrees and is 
continuing to rise. The&#39;re going to withdraw from the immediate region 
and will most likely loose the subsurface contacts in the thermal. 
They state that unless they receive further orders, they will remain 
under a Stage 3 Alert and run silent until they relocate the 
contacts.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren said a very rude word as she rubbed her temples. &quot;Acknowledge 
the message, Lieutenant, and tell them no further orders at this 
time.&quot; 

&quot;Understood, ma&#39;am,&quot; the lieutenant replied and turned to her console. 

Ael&#39;ien moved over to stand next to Admiral Si&#39;ren. &quot;How large is the 
primary radiation zone and what is the expected fallout pattern?&quot; she 
asked the room in general. 

An operator quickly checked her console before looking up. &quot;Captain, 
the primary zone is a two-mile radius with the radiation count 
dropping almost exponentially the further away from ground zero you 
measure. The radiation count has already dropped by half a percent and 
is projected to decay to zero in slightly more than seventy-two 
hours.&quot; 

Everyone&#39;s head snapped up at the stunning news. &quot;Total radiation 
decay in three days?&quot; Si&#39;ren asked, her eyes wide. &quot;What kind of 
nuclear weapon is capable of that?&quot; 

&quot;Tactical,&quot; K&#39;tal said flatly. &quot;Not just tactical, but surgical. You 
go in, drop the NP-whatever that is, kill every living thing within a 
very small radius, and sweep up the ashes three days later. No worries 
about exposing the clean-up teams to radiation, and you don&#39;t worry 
about accidentally causing ten times as many casualties with fallout.&quot; 

&quot;We don&#39;t have any of those, do we?&quot; Si&#39;ren said as she looked at the 
Dragoon commander. 

&quot;Not that I am aware of, ma&#39;am, but you know as well as I do how far 
that often goes around here,&quot; K&#39;tal said darkly, ignoring the 
reproving look he got from Captain Ael&#39;ien. 

&quot;Control, TacSat 31, new contact emerging from the rift, designate 
target avatar three,&quot; said the static-filled voice from the speaker. 
&quot;Avatar three is bearing two six eight at roughly eighteen miles per 
hour, altitude estimated to be fourteen angels. Avatar one is dropping 
altitude and has increased forward velocity to twelve miles per hour, 
bearing two six nine. Avatar two is coming around to bearing two six 
eight and maintaining speed.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren glanced over at Rune and frowned lightly. The general was 
staring at the display screen with a distant look in her eyes, almost 
as if she were daydreaming. Si&#39;ren knew that look well enough to know 
that was nowhere near to being accurate and started to worry slightly 
about what Rune was thinking. 

&quot;Control, TacSat 31, respond please..... radiation interference 
starting to increase, losing carrier signal....&quot; 

&quot;TacSat 31, Control,&quot; the communications officer said into her 
headset. &quot;We still read a clear signal from you, over.&quot; 

&quot;Control, TacSat 31, please respond.... losing carrier signal.... rift 
is now starting to close.... all avatars are now bearing two six nine, 
altitude sixteen angels, forward velocity thirty miles per hour.... 
Control.... at 31, plea.... nd, we are los.... ier signal....&quot; 

Both K&#39;tal and Si&#39;ren looked at General Rune. The general&#39;s eyes were 
closed and her head was slightly bowed as she listened to the 
increasing amount of static coming from the speakers. 

&quot;Con.... acSat.... ease resp.... al bre.... up, re.... a.... ing....&quot; 

&quot;TacSat 31, switch frequencies and signal again, over.&quot; 

&quot;.... a.... n.... sp.... k.... o....&quot; 

&quot;TacSat 31, please respond.&quot; 

&quot;.....&quot; 

&quot;Control to TacSat 31, please respond,&quot; the lieutenant said loudly 
into her headset. &quot;I repeat, please respond.&quot; 

Everyone listened in silence as the only response heard from the 
doomed unit was the usual soft crackling of static. The communications 
officer spent five minutes trying to reestablish a link to the unit 
before she quietly sighed to herself and closed down the network 
frequencies. 

&quot;General Rune, we&#39;ve lost communication with TacSat 31,&quot; she said 
quietly. 

&quot;Understood, Lieutenant,&quot; Rune replied softly. &quot;You did an excellent 
job keeping the line up as long as you did. You&#39;ll get a commendation 
for this.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; the lieutenant replied. 

&quot;What is the projected destination of the carriers?&quot; Rune asked. 

K&#39;tal looked at the display board and did a few quick mental 
calculations. &quot;Provided they don&#39;t change course or speed, they should 
reach the Imperial Castle in three days,&quot; he said slowly. 

&quot;She has a great deal of k&#39;vesan for a woman,&quot; Rune said quietly. 
&quot;More so than I had thought. What do we have between us and the 
carriers?&quot; 

&quot;The entire Eastern Division of the military,&quot; Ael&#39;ien replied 
instantly. &quot;Their regional command post is almost directly in the 
carriers path.&quot; 

&quot;Could they stop the carriers?&quot; Rune inquired, still staring at the 
main display board. The jagged black line that was the rift was 
rapidly becoming smaller with each passing second and the edges of the 
red blotch were starting to take on a somewhat fuzzy aspect. The white 
blips that were the airborne carriers had formed up into a wedge and 
were slowly moving together in a tight formation. 

&quot;Give the word, ma&#39;am, and we&#39;ll drop them,&quot; K&#39;tal stated. 

&quot;That is not what I asked, Commander,&quot; Rune said. 

K&#39;tal blinked. &quot;The carriers could definitely be stopped, General.&quot; 

&quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren, what is the missile strike range of the Leviathans?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren gave Rune a puzzled look. &quot;There is a hundred-mile-wide band, 
centered on the equator, that they can&#39;t reach from the polar oceans. 
Aside from that, they can hit any surface or relatively stationary 
airborne target.&quot; 

Rune grunted. She knew that both the Imperial Castle and the original 
Hinterland rift were situated well within fifty miles of the equator, 
as well as the fact that the carriers were definitely not stationary. 

&quot;Lieutenant, has there been any sort of signal or transmissions made 
from the carriers?&quot; Rune asked suddenly as she spun around to face the 
young communications officer. 

&quot;Unknown, ma&#39;am,&quot; the lieutenant replied. &quot;All the radiation in the 
area is interfering with the local sensor network and the fixed-site 
tactical posts are still disoriented from the EMP wave.&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien frowned in mild confusion, not having a great deal of 
background in communications. &quot;I don&#39;t get it, Lieutenant. I thought 
the fixed sites were satellite dishes with sensor webs. How do you 
&#39;disorient&#39; something like that?&quot; 

The lieutenant cleared her throat quietly. &quot;When anything nuclear is 
detonated, it gives off a wave of electro-magnetic energy. The pulse 
is strong enough to literally fry any electronics in the immediate 
area and to severely disrupt any electronics within range. When the 
carrier&#39;s NP missile hit, the EMP wave it emitted struck the fixed 
sites and caused their automatic tracking computers to become 
temporarily scrambled. Without computers to guide them, the dishes 
started to lose track of the satellites. Until the computers bring 
themselves back on-line and reorient themselves on the satellites, the 
data their sensor webs receives can&#39;t be transmitted. Provided the EMP 
wave didn&#39;t fry the sensors as well,&quot; she added. 

&quot;Lieutenant, call the Eastern Division headquarters and get me their 
field commander,&quot; Rune ordered as she strode over to the 
communications console and put on the headset. &quot;K&#39;tal, what sort of 
aircraft do we have available that is capable of getting close to 
those carriers and staying there?&quot; 

&quot;One moment, General,&quot; the Dragoon said as he turned to a nearby 
console and started to run a link to the central archive computer. 

The headset crackled faintly as a channel was opened. &quot;This is 
Lieutenant General Ra&#39;en,&quot; a strong voice said. &quot;I assume that if 
someone has sent the Nuclear Postman to visit us, we&#39;re going to war?&quot; 

The corners of Rune&#39;s mouth twitched in amusement. She had dated him 
for a short period of time before joining the military and it always 
struck her as funny just how often they ran into each other. The only 
reason she hadn&#39;t resumed their relationship was because his lack of a 
sense of humor seriously grated on her nerves at times. 

&quot;This is Commander General Rune, and we&#39;re still debating on that 
one,&quot; she said into the headset&#39;s microphone. &quot;Are you tracking the 
three airborne carriers that have emerged from the Hinterland rift?&quot; 

&quot;We are,&quot; Ra&#39;en replied. &quot;We&#39;re also tracking the aftermath of what 
looks like a brand-new and highly interesting type of NP missile. A 
missile that obliterated a significant portion of my reconaissance 
units,&quot; he added darkly. 

&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Rune said. &quot;I think she was trying to send a message to 
us and now it&#39;s time to send a message back.&quot; 

&quot;Payback or something else?&quot; 

&quot;Something else, Ra&#39;en. I&#39;m not about to start a nuclear war,&quot; she 
said, leaving off the unspoken &#39;yet&#39;. &quot;What I want you to do is 
simple. Deploy your entire division along their flight path and be 
ready to take them down at a moment&#39;s notice.&quot; 

&quot;With pleasure, ma&#39;am,&quot; Ra&#39;en said, the smile evident in his voice. 

Rune raised an eyebrow at the level of enthusiasm. &quot;Not so fast, 
Ra&#39;en, I&#39;m not finished yet. What I want is for those carriers to see 
you prepared to take them down. I want every radar and active sensor 
you have trained on them and lit up. Let them know you&#39;re watching 
them. Do you have any sort of airborne interceptors over there?&quot; 

There was a soft grunt from the field commander. &quot;All we have are 
those ancient Red Wing troop transports and a handful of 
Mer&#39;cata-class drones. The drones can take out soft targets like 
soldiers standing on the carrier decks, but they&#39;re virtually useless 
against anything remotely armored.&quot; 

&quot;Get them airborne and around those carriers. Can they hover or do 
they need forward motion to remain in-flight?&quot; Rune asked. 

Ra&#39;en made a huffing noise deep in his throat. Most would think he was 
clearing his throat, but Rune knew that was his equivalent of a belly 
laugh. &quot;They can hover. If you want, I can park them six inches away 
from the hulls of the carriers and keep them there. If the carriers 
move, so do the drones.&quot; 

&quot;All I want is for those carriers to know that they&#39;re there and 
keeping an extremely close eye on them,&quot; Rune said. 

&quot;Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, Rune, but I take it all you want us to do is 
to rattle their cage and make sure they know we&#39;re ready for them?&quot; 
Ra&#39;en asked in an even tone. 

Rune smiled. &quot;Exactly, Ra&#39;en, but under no circumstances do you 
provoke them or do anything that might make them think they&#39;re under 
attack. Is that clear?&quot; 

&quot;Clear as crystal, ma&#39;am,&quot; said the voice over the headset. 

&quot;Oh, and one more thing,&quot; Rune said evenly. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;If they do fire on you, you have full authority to bring them down.&quot; 

&quot;Understood. Do you want to see the craters from orbit?&quot; Ra&#39;en asked. 

Rune sighed and rubbed her temples, knowing full well that he was 
being serious and wondering what she had seen in him so many centuries 
ago. &quot;It doesn&#39;t need to be messy, Ra&#39;en, but do what you have to do 
to take them down if it becomes necessary,&quot; she said wearily. 

&quot;Understood, General Rune. Eastern Division headquarters out,&quot; he said 
and closed the line down. 

&quot;I assume you have a plan of action in mind, ma&#39;am?&quot; Ael&#39;ien asked 
when Rune removed her headset. 

&quot;I might, but I&#39;m going to need time to work it out, and time is in 
very short supply right now,&quot; Rune replied as she looked at the 
display screen once again. &quot;Commander K&#39;tal, I want that aircraft 
status report ready in half an hour, along with the technical data 
regarding the Vresh&#39;tan class of carriers and a scientific analysis of 
that nuclear device they used.&quot; 

Inwardly, K&#39;tal winced at the short deadline, but was too professional 
to allow his discomfort to show. &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; he said simply and 
turned his full attention to his computer link. 

&quot;Captain Ael&#39;ien, I want you to coordinate with the other unit 
captains in the area to organize a tight defense of the castle. 
Concentrate the bulk of the defenses to the east and prepare for 
primarily air strikes, but don&#39;t leave any angle unprotected against 
either air-based or ground-based offensives,&quot; Rune continued. &quot;Keep in 
communication with the Eastern Division and contact the other Divisons 
if necessary.&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien saluted sharply and spun on her heel, leaving the command 
center in such a manner as to move as fast as possible while retaining 
the dignity of her rank. 

&quot;Lieutenant, I want you to monitor the carrier group for any attempts 
at communication, either between themselves or to anywhere else. If 
they so much as break wind, I want to hear about it,&quot; Rune said to the 
young communications officer. 

&quot;Understood, General,&quot; the lieutenant said and turned to her console. 

&quot;And as for you, Admiral,&quot; Rune said, her voice low but containing a 
noticable edge, &quot;I think we need to resume our talk and quickly. There 
are still a few things I need to know, things that may have a profound 
impact on what course of action we take.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren nodded silently and the two of them began to make their way out 
of the control center and back towards Si&#39;ren&#39;s quarters. The Fleet 
Admiral waited until they were out of earshot of everyone before she 
took Rune&#39;s elbow and pulled her to a stop. 

&quot;Rune, what are you thinking?&quot; Si&#39;ren asked quietly. 

&quot;I&#39;m thinking that Nop&#39;tera is going to want to take control of the 
entire military when she gets back,&quot; Rune said quietly, &quot;And I don&#39;t 
think she&#39;s going to take &#39;no&#39; for an answer. The problem is, she&#39;s 
been gone from this world for over four thousand years. Things have 
changed in that time and I&#39;m not convinced she&#39;s capable of adapting 
to the changes.&quot; 

&quot;You could be wrong,&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out. 

Rune turned around and looked straight into Si&#39;ren&#39;s eyes. &quot;Before you 
start making up your mind on who the Navy is going to side with,&quot; Rune 
said, &quot;I want you to ask yourself this: Do you want to take orders 
from someone who has no qualms about using nuclear weapons as a 
first-strike option?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren raised a slender eyebrow. &quot;Didn&#39;t you just authorize Ra&#39;en to 
use nuclear devices a few minutes ago?&quot; 

&quot;Who got nuked first?&quot; Rune said flatly, her voice as cold as steel. 

Si&#39;ren remained silent as they resumed their journey to her quarters, 
neither of the two women noticing when their respective bodyguards 
swiftly and silently gathered around to escort them like invisible 
shadows. Rune&#39;s words continued to echo in Si&#39;ren&#39;s mind and the 
admiral couldn&#39;t help but wonder if indeed she wanted to follow the 
orders of a historical legend who had been out of touch for so long. 

This is going to be very, very interesting, she thought as they 
reached her quarters and she ushered Rune inside. Yes, very 
interesting, the admiral thought as the doors closed behind her and 
the general. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Ami glanced over at Leda as she took her seat on the school bus. &quot;Are 
you sure you&#39;re going to be okay?&quot; she asked yet again, wondering just 
what exactly the brunette had been thinking, or even if she had been. 

Leda shot her a dark look, a look made even worse by the thin cut on 
her left cheek. &quot;I told you I&#39;m fine,&quot; she growled as she readjusted 
the backpack on her shoulder and tried not to wince as the straps 
rubbed across a bruise. 

&quot;Another fight?&quot; Rei asked as she walked past and took a seat behind 
Ami. She saw the reproving look she received from Ami and sighed. 
&quot;Alright, so who lit the fuse on your tampon this time?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m about to readjust the location of yours if you don&#39;t leave me 
alone,&quot; was Leda&#39;s harsh reply. 

Rei blinked at the hostility. &quot;Calm down, Leda, I didn&#39;t do anything 
to you. I was just curious as to what happened.&quot; 

&quot;What happened was some juvenile punk decided he wanted to see what I 
was wearing beneath my skirt,&quot; Leda said with another growl. &quot;He said 
something about hearing rumors I don&#39;t like to wear panties and tried 
to get a look for himself.&quot; 

Rei exchanged glances with Ami, the vampire raising a slender eyebrow 
in response and the Shinto priestess blinking in surprise, not 
believing someone had been stupid enough to pull that sort of stunt 
with anyone, let alone with a girl with Leda&#39;s temperment. &quot;And so you 
decided to introduce him into the pavement?&quot; Rei asked cautiously. 

Leda smirked. &quot;Three times, and that was after he met the fence.&quot; 

&quot;Now who do we know that likes to gossip and spread rumors?&quot; Rei said 
loudly as Mina stepped onto the bus, struggling to keep an overweight 
backpack balanced on her shoulders. 

&quot;It had better not have been you, Mina, or you&#39;re really going to be 
in for it,&quot; Leda said with a frown, still in a dark mood. 

The blonde stopped in mid-motion and blinked, regarding the three of 
them curiously. &quot;What&#39;d I do this time?&quot; She took a closer look at 
Leda and her blue eyes blinked again. &quot;Whoa, what happened to you?&quot; 

Rei spoke up quickly before Leda could growl a potentially profane 
reply. &quot;Someone direly needed an attitude adjustment, and if it had 
happened to me, I&#39;d have rung his bell too,&quot; she explained with a 
small smile. 

&quot;Another fight?&quot; Mina sighed as she sat down next to Ami. Her motions 
caused her backpack&#39;s weight to shift, resulting in her tilting to one 
side and promptly falling out of the seat. 

&quot;So much for grace,&quot; Rei commented. 

&quot;Have you seen Serena lately?&quot; Ami asked quickly before the blonde 
could come up with a suitable scathing retort. 

&quot;Detention yet again,&quot; Mina replied sourly as she slipped the straps 
off of her shoulders and sat back down, dragging the backpack under 
the seat in the process. She blinked as something occured to her and 
she turned to give Leda a cautious look. &quot;What were you saying earlier 
about me doing something?&quot; 

The brunette gave her a decidedly dark look. &quot;I&#39;m just wondering who 
it is around here who&#39;s been spreading the extremely inaccurate rumor 
that I like to wear skirts without panties,&quot; she said slowly with an 
edge to her voice. 

Mina made a face. &quot;Don&#39;t look at me, girl, that&#39;s not the sort of 
gossip I deal with. Granted the no-panties thing sounds an awful lot 
like something you would do, but....&quot; Her voice was cut off as she 
tried to scramble out of the seat as Leda launched herself towards the 
opposite side of the bus, her green eyes blazing. 

The impending melee was brought to a screeching halt as Ami went 
vampiric and froze Leda in place with a look from her hypnotic 
steel-blue vampire eyes. &quot;Are you finished?&quot; Ami asked softly. 

Leda was captivated by the eerie glint in her eyes and could only nod 
slowly in agreement. Ami&#39;s eyes faded from steel-blue back to their 
usual shade of blue and Leda felt her body start to respond to her 
brain again. She quickly stood up and shook her head rapidly for a 
moment to clear out the residual hypnotic cobwebs. &quot;You know I hate it 
when you do that,&quot; she said flatly as she sat back down, ignoring the 
blonde cowering being Rei. 

&quot;If you and Mina would behave, I wouldn&#39;t have to do that,&quot; Ami 
replied mildly as she fished a textbook out of her backpack and 
started to study. 

&quot;Do what?&quot; Molly asked as she got on the bus. She looked around for an 
empty seat and saw the open space next to Leda. &quot;Mind if I sit here?&quot; 

Leda looked at Molly warily. Molly had been Serena&#39;s best friend since 
kindergarten and the two had been almost inseparable until Serena&#39;s 
awakening to her true identity as Sailor Moon. Their friendship still 
continued, but Serena&#39;s constant worry that she might slip up and 
reveal herself to Molly was starting to take its toll on the blonde. 

&quot;It might be safer if you sit next to me,&quot; Rei said as she casually 
shoved Mina out of the seat with her elbow. &quot;Psycho over there got 
herself into another fight.&quot; 

Leda&#39;s head whipped around to fix the priestess with a venomous glare. 
&quot;If you call me that one more time....&quot; she growled, then glanced over 
at Ami as she cleared her throat loudly, still reading the textbook. 
Leda muttered something acidic beneath her breath as she turned around 
and stared out the window. 

Molly blinked as her gaze alternated between Ami and Leda. &quot;Am I 
missing something?&quot; she said softly to Rei as she sat down next to 
her. &quot;I mean, I know as well as everyone else how short-tempered Leda 
is,&quot; she said slowly, shivering lightly as she saw Leda&#39;s expression 
reflected in the window, &quot;But if I didn&#39;t know better, I would think 
she was afraid of Ami.&quot; She blinked as four heads suddenly turned 
around to look at her. 

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Leda said in a tone cold enough to condense nitrogen. 

Rei caught the look of mild surprise in Ami&#39;s eyes and had to bite her 
tongue to keep herself from laughing. &quot;What makes you say that?&quot; she 
asked. 

&quot;Well,&quot; Molly said hesitantly. &quot;Why would a person who routinely kicks 
people&#39;s butts for fun back down from someone as harmless as Ami?&quot; 

Leda opened her mouth to say something but remained silent as she felt 
rather than saw Ami&#39;s warning glance in her direction. Someone is 
going to pay for this one, the brunette thought to herself as she 
gritted her teeth. 

&quot;Ami? Harmless?&quot; Mina said incrediously, ignorning the sudden wave of 
pain spreading across her wrist as it was grabbed by a hand and held 
in an inhuman grip with the strength of steel. &quot;Girl, you have no idea 
just how dangerous Ami can be.&quot; 

Molly blinked in surprise, glancing between the serious look in Mina&#39;s 
blue eyes and the neutral look on Ami&#39;s face. &quot;Umm....&quot; 

Mina leaned closer to Molly, partially to keep from being overheard 
and partially to try to relieve some of the pressure on her wrist. 
&quot;Ami isn&#39;t what she appears to be,&quot; she whispered, struggling 
valiantly to keep her facial expression constant while the pressure on 
her wrist drastically increased, threatening to implode the bones into 
powder. &quot;She&#39;s been specially trained in the seven-hundred-year-old 
Dragoon unarmed hand-to-hand combat techniques and could easily hand 
Leda her butt if they ever got into another fight.&quot; 

Molly blinked and looked around her. Leda had turned around to face 
the front of the bus, her facial expression unreadable. Ami&#39;s 
expression was one of mild amusement while Mina&#39;s was an odd mixture 
of seriousness, pain, and relief. She saw motion out of the corner of 
her eye and turned her head in time to see a tiny drop of blood fall 
from the corner of Rei&#39;s lip onto the edge of her skirt. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; she asked in concern. 

&quot;Juth bit my tongue,&quot; Rei mumbled to herself as she inwardly struggled 
to keep her insides from bursting with laughter at Mina&#39;s statement. 
She had accidentally bitten her tongue hard enough to make it bleed 
and was now trying to use the pain as a focus to control herself. 

Molly blinked again and turned to look at Ami curiously. &quot;How is it 
that you&#39;ve never told anyone about this before?&quot; she asked 
cautiously, still trying to decide if Mina had been telling her the 
truth about Ami. 

Ami shrugged and smiled mysteriously. &quot;Two reasons. First, I&#39;ve only 
learned within the past year. And second....&quot; She trailed off, 
pretended to be in deep thought for a moment, and simply shrugged. 
&quot;Well, it just never occured to me to tell anyone.&quot; 

Molly blinked yet again. &quot;Seriously?&quot; she asked in awe. 

Ami nodded. &quot;Seriously.&quot; 

&quot;Whoa....&quot; Molly breathed quietly with a glance towards Leda. &quot;So 
maybe she really is afraid of you.&quot; With good reason, she mentally 
added as she tried to fight the tiny tendril of fear developing within 
her. 

Leda snorted. &quot;Not quite,&quot; she said without bothering to turn around. 

&quot;Well, you know what they say,&quot; Mina said with an impish grin as she 
discreetly massaged her wrist and tried not to imagine how badly it 
was going to bruise and ache by sundown. 

&quot;What?&quot; Leda growled with a look at the blonde. 

&quot;Beware the quiet ones,&quot; she said mock-ominously. 

Everyone blinked and tried not to shudder as Ami started to laugh, a 
soft, low-pitched laugh that sent chills down everyone&#39;s spine and 
made Molly start to wonder if Ami was laughing because of the humor or 
because of the effect it was having on everyone else. Everyone else 
already knew the real reason Ami was laughing, which made their unease 
even worse. 

&quot;Should I ask?&quot; Molly asked in a small voice. 

Ami&#39;s eyes closed as a small smile tugged on the corners of her lips. 
&quot;Be afraid,&quot; she stage-whispered, &quot;Be very afraid.&quot; And if it wasn&#39;t 
for the fact that she had felt herself going vampiric, she would have 
smiled at Molly. 

I&#39;m sorry I asked, Molly thought as she repressed a shiver as the bus 
driver started the bus and pulled out of the school parking lot. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Leda&#39;s head snapped up as the bus came to a halt, the sound of the air 
brakes grating on the few nerves she had left. Here already? she 
thought fuzzily as she tried to chase the cobwebs out of her mind. She 
was about to get up and leave the bus when she saw Mina and Rei stand 
up. 

Nope, one more stop, she thought as she let her head fall back onto 
her arms. She closed her eyes and tried to stay awake for another ten 
minutes. She heard Mina&#39;s overly-cheerful voice saying something to 
Rei about going to the mall later, then heard her 
suddenly-not-so-cheerful tone as her backpack shifted again and she 
started to lose her balance as she got off the bus. 

Leda growled quietly to herself as she heard Rei&#39;s quiet laughter and 
felt someone pat her on the back before moving past her to exit the 
bus. She heard the soft squeak of the bus doors closing, then felt 
someone tugging rather insistently on her arm. 

&quot;Come on, Leda, this is our stop,&quot; Ami said mildly. 

&quot;What?&quot; Leda said as she peeled her forehead off of her arms to glare 
at the scenery around her. &quot;C&#39;mon, Ami, we&#39;re still at the other.... 
stop?&quot; she trailed off as the landscape around her registered on her 
brain. 

&quot;Just a moment, she&#39;s still asleep,&quot; Ami apologized to the bus driver 
as she continued to gently tug on Leda&#39;s arm. 

&quot;Hey, no prob, we all get those days,&quot; the bus driver said with a 
grin. 

Leda growled softly softly to herself as she stood up and hefted the 
backpack onto her shoulder. Her blood supply remained where it was, 
however, and the world around her whirled madly as her brain started 
to starve from temporary lack of oxygen. She would have fallen over if 
it hadn&#39;t been for the supporting hand still gripping her shoulder. 

&quot;I had better take you home before you hurt yourself,&quot; Ami said 
mildly. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, Ami,&quot; Leda muttered as the world reoriented itself. 

&quot;Of course you will,&quot; Ami said soothingly as she guided Leda off of 
the bus and down the street. &quot;We also need to talk for a bit, so I 
might as well take you home while I&#39;m at it.&quot; She turned around and 
blinked in surprise when Molly followed them off of the bus. &quot;I 
thought your bus stop was the next one over,&quot; she said. 

Molly shrugged. &quot;I live between the two stops, so it&#39;s the same 
distance no matter which stop I use. I only usually use the other one 
because it&#39;s the one Serena uses. Is Leda going to be alright?&quot; 

Leda sighed. &quot;I&#39;m fine, people, I just need a bit of a nap. I was up 
late last night and didn&#39;t get much sleep.&quot; 

Ami smirked. &quot;That explains quite a lot, actually.&quot; 

&quot;Cork it, girl.&quot; 

Molly frowned. &quot;You two aren&#39;t going to start fighting, are you?&quot; 

Ami laughed. &quot;Oh, no, Leda&#39;s always like that when she&#39;s 
sleep-deprived and I never pay any attention it. She&#39;ll be fine once 
she crawls into bed.&quot; 

&quot;Crawl is the word,&quot; Leda muttered as her head started to ache. 

Molly blinked, looking like she was on the verge of saying something. 
She apparently changed her mind when she shrugged and waved to them. 
&quot;Well if you&#39;re sure she&#39;ll be alright, I&#39;ll catch you two later. Take 
care!&quot; 

Ami nodded. &quot;You too,&quot; she said as she turned around and took hold of 
Leda&#39;s elbow. &quot;It&#39;s down this street, not that one,&quot; she said lightly 
as she corrected Leda&#39;s course, pointedly ignoring the toxic comments 
coming from beneath the brunette&#39;s breath. 

Molly paused and watched them walk down the street, her thoughts 
occupied with Mina&#39;s words about Ami&#39;s training. 
Seven-hundred-year-old Dragoon unarmed hand-to-hand combat training, 
she thought. It sounds like something someone dug up out of one of 
those Chinese fighting movies, one of those supposedly ancient and 
obscure techniques only heroes can learn. Not that I doubt in the 
least that Ami hasn&#39;t had some sort of training but.... 

She paused in mid-thought as her subconscious told her she was missing 
something. She was about to find a place to sit down and do some 
serious brain-wracking when she heard a rather squeaky voice speaking 
from right behind her ear. 

&quot;So what did the Psycho-Killer do this time?&quot; Melvin asked. 

Her actions were a mixture of reflex and habit. Without looking behind 
her, her arm shot out and grabbed for the front of his shirt. She got 
a sense of satisfaction when she felt the cotton-nylon mix right where 
it should have been. Predictable, if nothing else, she thought as she 
braced herself and heaved with all of her strength. 

She did her best to conceal her smile as Melvin smoothly sailed past 
her and into a nearby tree. It&#39;s amazing, she thought as he bounced to 
the ground, with as many times as I&#39;ve done this, he still hasn&#39;t 
learned to either quit sneaking up on me like that or to stand 
elsewhere when he does. 

&quot;Gosh, I&#39;m sorry, Melvin,&quot; she said in her American drawl, &quot;You just 
scared the daylights out of me, sneaking up on me like that. Are you 
okay?&quot; 

Melvin grunted as he stood up and readjusted his oversized glasses. 
&quot;I&#39;m just fine, Molly. Didn&#39;t mean to spook you like that,&quot; he said as 
he brushed tiny bits of bark off of his black school uniform. &quot;You 
know, I think you&#39;ve gotten stronger as of late.&quot; 

Molly sighed. I don&#39;t believe this, she thought. Perhaps meeting so 
many trees has rattled his brain. Assuming he had one to rattle to 
begin with, she thought with a mental smile. &quot;I guess all those 
exercises in gym class are helping out.&quot; 

Melvin wrinkled his nose at the mention of gym class. It was no secret 
that he hated gym class, namely because it forced him to focus his 
attention on something that had absolutely no bearing on computers and 
the sciences. Or on the only other thing he really paid any attention 
to. 

&quot;Guess what I heard in the rumor mill the other day?&quot; he said 
cheerfully as he worked a kink out of his now-sore shoulder. &quot;Ami&#39;s 
got a boyfriend, and an older one at that.&quot; 

Whatever particular train of thought that was trying to work its way 
through Molly&#39;s brain was instantly derailed by Melvin&#39;s words. 
&quot;Melvin, are you joking?&quot; she said incrediously. She had never held 
him in a high regard, but virtually everything that had come out of 
his &#39;rumor mill&#39; had proven to be at least partially accurate. 

Melvin shook his head, knowing that he now had her full attention. 
&quot;I&#39;m telling you the truth! One of my sources saw her having dinner in 
a small Chinese restaurant with a guy who looked to be pushing 
thirty-five.&quot; 

Molly sighed. &quot;So what makes you think it&#39;s a boyfriend and not 
someone like her father or another relative?&quot; she sighed. 

&quot;Because someone like Ami doesn&#39;t take romantic walks in the park with 
a relative,&quot; Melvin said as he adjusted his glasses. &quot;We&#39;re talking 
some major hand-holding.... and more.&quot; 

Molly blinked, her green eyes going wide. &quot;And more?&quot; 

Melvin nodded soberly. &quot;Lip action,&quot; he whispered conspiratorally. 

A sudden burning sensation in her chest told Molly that she had been 
holding her breath for too long. She turned to look in the direction 
Ami had gone as she slowly exhaled, not believing that a bookworm like 
Ami would fall for an older man. &quot;You know what they say,&quot; she said as 
the words started to echo within her mind. 

Melvin squinted at her. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; 

&quot;Beware the quiet ones,&quot; Molly said quietly as she repressed a shiver. 

&quot;You don&#39;t say....&quot; Melvin said quietly. &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll walk you home. 
I&#39;ve managed to pick up a ton of gossip after school today....&quot; 

Molly repressed a second shiver at the thought of having to put up 
with Melvin&#39;s prattle the entire walk home. &quot;Actually, I&#39;ve got a few 
errands to run before I head home,&quot; she said smoothly. &quot;Perhaps 
another time.&quot; 

Melvin nodded in deluded understanding. &quot;Hey, no problem. I&#39;ve got a 
few places to go myself after dinner. Maybe we&#39;ll run into each 
other.&quot; 

Not if I can help it, she thought. &quot;I&#39;ll try to keep an eye out for 
you. See you around!&quot; she said as she waved and made a quick but 
causal exit. Once she was sure he was out of both sight and sound, she 
paused to lean against a brick wall and let out a large sigh. 

&quot;Why does he have to bother me?&quot; she muttered to herself before she 
took a calming breath and headed towards the park. Her subconscious 
was starting to bother her again and she needed to do some 
industrial-strength thinking in a place where she was sure to be left 
alone in relative peace. 

The park was empty of people when she arrived. She knew that only the 
hard-core joggers would be out at this hour and that the crowd of 
romantics wouldn&#39;t be out until close to sunset. A small breeze was 
drifting across the surface of the artificial lake, bringing with it 
the reassuring scent of cool water and the faint calls of a trio of 
hungry seagulls. 

Just the thing to help clear the mind, she thought happily to herself 
as she absently headed towards the gazebo. She had almost made it when 
a figure stepped out from a large bush and stood before her. 

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; he said softly in a deep voice. 

Molly looked up at him, blinked twice, and promptly started screaming. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The walk from the bus stop to her apartment was enough to wake most of 
her mind up, much to her dismay. Give me a shot of something hard and 
ten minutes, Leda thought hazily, and I&#39;ll probably be out until three 
in the morning. 

&quot;I&#39;m here and in one piece, Ami, so you can go away now,&quot; she sighed 
as she dug her keys out of her skirt pocket. 

&quot;We still need to talk,&quot; Ami said pointedly. 

Leda sighed as she unlocked the door. &quot;Fine, fine, just let me use the 
can first and grab a drink or three, then we&#39;ll talk.&quot; 

Now it was Ami&#39;s turn to sigh at the mention of drinks. &quot;Your body is 
suffering enough as it is, Leda, and alcohol will only make it worse.&quot; 

The brunette snorted as she opened the door and ushered Ami inside. &quot;I 
think I&#39;ve learned my personal tolerances by now, thank you,&quot; she said 
as she followed Ami inside and closed the door behind her with a 
slightly off-balance kick. She paused at the entraceway and mentally 
gauged the distance between her and her living room couch. &quot;Step aside 
for a moment.&quot; 

The vampire gave her an odd look as she stepped into the kitchen, 
keeping a slightly wary eye on what Leda was up to. She blinked as 
Leda slid the backpack off of her shoulder, carefully hefted it, and 
launched it into the air with a flick of her wrist. 

Ami watched as the backpack sailed smoothly through the air, landed 
hard on the carpeting, rolled twice, and came to a halt face-up right 
next to the coffee table. &quot;That was impressive,&quot; she said in 
amazement. 

Leda&#39;s face crinkled in disgust. &quot;Bah, I was aiming for the couch,&quot; 
she said as she turned down the hallway and into the bathroom. &quot;You 
know the deal, Ami, make yourself at home, blah blah blah.&quot; 

Ami just shook her head as the bathroom door closed somewhat 
forcefully. Her mind was already tallying up the rather substantial 
collection of subtle and not-so-subtle signs of Leda&#39;s sleep 
deprivation. Irritation, crankiness, significant drowsiness, slight 
loss of balance, worse than usual aggression, Ami thought to herself 
as she made her way into the living room and sat down on the couch. 

She looked up when she heard the bathroom door open and heard 
footsteps making their way down towards the bedroom, accompanied by a 
constant monotone growl. She tentatively decided Leda was going to 
change out of her school clothes and thought it best to spend the 
estimated ten minutes studying. With that in mind, she opened her 
backpack, retrieved her somewhat oversized physics textbook, and 
quietly resumed studying particle physics. 

Her first clue that she had completely lost track of time and the 
outside world came when there was a loud pop, quickly followed by the 
sensation of a small, light projectile bouncing off the page in front 
of her. Startled, she looked up to see Leda holding a bottle in both 
hands and giving her a very evil and wicked grin. 

&quot;I keep telling you that if a freight train can go screaming past 
without you noticing, you&#39;re studying too hard,&quot; the brunette said 
mildly as she poured the bottle&#39;s contents into a pair of wine glasses 
on the coffee table. 

&quot;So when did you become a freight train?&quot; Ami replied, blinking in 
mild surprise as she noticed that Leda was dressed in a rather 
immodest nightgown. &quot;And I take it you plan on going to bed real 
soon?&quot; 

&quot;Just as soon as you go away and leave me in peace,&quot; Leda replied. She 
set the half-empty bottle back down on the table and picked up the 
glasses, handing one of them to Ami. &quot;Here, you should like this. 
It&#39;ll warm your blood if nothing else.&quot; 

Ami sighed. &quot;Alcohol?&quot; she said as she eyed the glass warily. 

The brunette just sighed. &quot;Just taste the damn thing before you start 
passing judgement. Yeah it&#39;s got some alcohol in it, but the amount is 
so low you couldn&#39;t get a cat drunk on it. I know your tolerance for 
alcohol is depressingly low, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll hardly feel it at 
all.&quot; 

Ami repressed another sigh as she took the offered glass and held it 
up to the light to study it. It&#39;s pretty if nothing else, she thought 
as she gazed at the amethyst liquid. She cautiously sniffed at it for 
a moment before she took a hesitant sip. 

Leda leaned back to watch Ami&#39;s reaction, sipping at her own glass. 
&quot;So what do you think?&quot; she asked slowly. 

Ami blinked and swallowed, gently running her tongue along her teeth 
as the liquid tingled faintly on the way down. She took a second sip 
of the amethyst liquid, letting it roll around on her tongue for a 
moment before sending it down after the first sip. &quot;What is it?&quot; 

A smile started to form on the edges of Leda&#39;s lips. &quot;So you like it?&quot; 

Ami took another sip, trying to decide if it was as pleasing to her as 
she thought. &quot;Actually, I do,&quot; she admitted after a moment. &quot;So what 
is it?&quot; 

&quot;Plum wine,&quot; Leda said as she showed her the bottle. &quot;I had never 
heard of it before and picked up a bottle last week to see what it was 
like.&quot; 

&quot;Mmmm....&quot; Ami hummed to herself as she studied the bottle. She had 
almost finished reading the label and was about to ask Leda where she 
got it when she suddenly froze in position and closed her eyes. 

&quot;Problem?&quot; Leda asked, one eyebrow arched up in concern. 

Ami slowly leaned back and sighed to herself as she felt an odd warmth 
start to bloom in her abdomen. &quot;No, just the alcohol hitting my 
bloodstream,&quot; she explained with a faint smile of contentment. 

Leda blinked. &quot;Already?&quot; 

Ami&#39;s eyes opened to reveal the steel-blue color of her vampiric side. 
&quot;Things that affect the blood affect you fast when you&#39;re a vampire,&quot; 
she said as the warmth started to spread across her entire body. &quot;And 
trust me, this is a very pleasant feeling.&quot; 

The brunette laughed to herself. &quot;At least someone is having a bit of 
fun around here. Or should I say still,&quot; she added. She caught the 
confused look in Ami&#39;s eyes and she chuckled. &quot;Come now, don&#39;t tell me 
you didn&#39;t enjoy seeing the look in Molly&#39;s eyes when Mina told her 
about your &#39;seven-hundred- year-old Dragoon&#39; training.&quot; 

Ami couldn&#39;t refrain from laughing for a few moments. &quot;Yes, that was 
rather amusing. Did you see the look on Rei&#39;s face? I thought she was 
going to strangle herself trying not to laugh.&quot; 

Leda started to giggle so hard she almost spilled her wine. &quot;Oh, man, 
I wish someone could have caught that on film.&quot; 

Ami smiled as she took another sip of wine, mentally calculating how 
much she could safely drink without casuing too much chaos in her 
bloodstream. She knew that her vampiric nature wouldn&#39;t be bothered by 
small amounts of alcohol but her human side was a different matter 
altogether. She had learned the hard way that just because the burning 
in her veins feels good now doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;ll continue to feel 
good in a few hours. 

She looked up at Leda as the brunette&#39;s moment of humor passed and she 
saw the effects of insufficient sleep starting to return. At this 
rate, she&#39;ll be asleep within the next ten minutes, Ami thought with a 
mental sigh as she took a sip of her wine. Her thoughts were followed 
by a physical sigh as she leaned forward to set her glass down on the 
coffee table. 

Neither the sigh nor the movements were lost on Leda, and the brunette 
sighed heavily herself as she leaned back in the chair. &quot;Alright, so 
what did you want to talk about?&quot; she said wearily. 

Ami raised a blue-tinted eyebrow in response. &quot;So what happened last 
night that caused you to lose so much sleep?&quot; she asked gently. 

Leda snorted and took a sip of her wine. &quot;Nothing much, really. 
Tolaris was able to talk to what&#39;s-his-butt over in the Negaverse, and 
most of what was said was said in the denizen language. I left there 
shortly before midnight, returned here, and couldn&#39;t fall asleep 
because I had too much on my mind.&quot; 

&quot;Like what?&quot; Ami asked cautiously as she took a calculated sip of 
wine. 

Leda shot her a dark look. &quot;None of your business.&quot; 

Ami blinked and set her glass down, leaning back against the cushions 
to think for a moment. Something about Leda&#39;s statement didn&#39;t sound 
quite right to her and the feeling didn&#39;t sit well. &quot;Something tells 
me you&#39;re not telling me everything I want to know,&quot; she said after 
serveral minutes of silence. 

Leda merely shrugged and sat back, looking at her with tired green 
eyes. &quot;Sorry if you had high expectations.&quot; 

Ami frowned and leaned forward. &quot;Shortly after eleven o&#39;clock last 
night, all of the denizens&#39; communicators were switched into privacy 
mode. If you left around midnight, you would have still been in the 
cathedral when whatever it was happened that caused them to want 
privacy.&quot; 

Leda sighed and looked towards the ceiling. &quot;So maybe they didn&#39;t want 
to be disturbed when talking to whomever that guy was. I don&#39;t know, 
Ami.&quot; 

Ami frowned as she picked up her glass of wine and took a small sip. 
&quot;If that was the case, which I&#39;m starting to doubt, they would have 
done that when they first contacted the Negaverse, not three hours 
later. And seeing how all four of them still have their frequencies 
locked in privacy mode, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re doing it while they 
talk.&quot; 

Leda drained her glass and set it on the coffee table before standing 
up. &quot;You&#39;re barking up the wrong tree, girl,&quot; she said as she started 
to stretch, accidentally revealing a sizable amount of her feminine 
anatomy in the process. She noticed Ami glance away with a faint blush 
on her cheeks and she frowned, tugging the silk-like fabric back into 
place. Whomever designed this nightgown obviously didn&#39;t give a damn 
about modesty, she thought. Either that, or they had a different 
purpose in mind when they designed this. Come to think of it, that&#39;s 
probably why I bought this in the first place.... 

Her thoughts led her mind down the path it had taken late last night, 
causing her to sigh heavily as the familiar burden settled itself on 
her soul once again. Not tonight, she sighed to herself as she rubbed 
her face with her hands and started to make her way to her bedroom. 

&quot;Tired?&quot; Ami asked softly. 

&quot;Tired, me?&quot; Leda said mock-cheerfully. &quot;No, never. Go away and let me 
get some rest, Ami.&quot; She looked up as Ami reached out and took hold of 
her arm in a surprisingly gentle grip. 

&quot;You&#39;re hiding something from me,&quot; Ami said softly. 

The brunette sighed. &quot;Listen, you can either come with me or stay 
here, but I am going to go to bed,&quot; she said, her voice betraying her 
weariness more than she would have liked. She tugged her arm free of 
Ami&#39;s grasp and walked down the hall, mildly surprised when Ami 
followed her into her bedroom. 

Leda sighed again as she walked over to her closet and started to lay 
out the clothes she was going to wear to school the next day. Ami 
stopped only a few feet beyond the doorway, wanting to get Leda to 
talk more but not wishing to further intrude. Her eyes glanced around 
the room briefly before her gaze was captured by the open photo album 
on the dresser. 

Interesting, Ami thought as she moved closer for a better look, I 
don&#39;t recall ever seeing this particular album before. It only took a 
few seconds for her to realize why. The photo on the left was one of 
Leda and the photo on the right was one of Jenni, the girl Leda had 
fallen in love with not too long ago. The thing that set the photos 
apart from all the others was the fact that neither one of them had 
been wearing any clothes when the pictures were taken. 

Ami looked up as Leda walked over to see what she was looking at. 
There was an awkward moment of silence as deep blushes spread across 
the faces of both girls. &quot;I thought I had put that away,&quot; Leda mumbled 
as she reached out to close the album. She blinked when she felt Ami&#39;s 
hand blocking her path and looked up. 

&quot;When were these taken?&quot; Ami asked softly. 

Leda sighed. &quot;About ten months ago. I don&#39;t know if I ever told you 
just how benevolently mischievious the little imp could be. She 
somehow managed to get her hands on a fully loaded Polaroid camera and 
talked me into a photo session,&quot; she said, the blush on her cheeks 
deepening slightly. 

&quot;You don&#39;t regret it, do you?&quot; 

Leda blinked in surprise and looked over at Ami. She was about to ask 
why she was asking that particular question when she suddenly 
remembered seeing a picture of Ami in a very similar situation. 
&quot;Nope,&quot; Leda replied truthfully. &quot;Both she and I enjoyed the whole 
thing. Both during and after,&quot; she added. 

Ami said nothing as she studied the pictures, paying particular 
interest to the emotions reflected in the eyes and smiles of both 
girls. Her hand was reaching out to turn the page when Leda suddenly 
remembered where exactly she had put that picture of Ami she had 
acquired. 

&quot;Sorry, got to have some secrets,&quot; Leda muttered as she somewhat 
hastily picked up the album and snapped it shut, locking the cover 
with a flick of her wrist and setting it down inside her dresser 
drawer. 

Ami&#39;s only response was to raise an eyebrow and to study her 
reflection in the mirror, her thoughts unreadable in the depths of her 
vampiric steel-blue eyes. &quot;Leda, why won&#39;t you tell me what happened 
last night?&quot; she said softly. 

Leda sighed and turned to look out the bedroom window, her mind 
already becoming plagued by the sadness and loneliness that had 
enveloped her since Jenni&#39;s death. She debated on what she could say 
versus what she wanted to say versus what she felt Ami deserved to 
know. She finally decided on sighing heavily and speaking the truth 
softly. &quot;Tolaris asked me not to tell you.&quot; 

Ami&#39;s head snapped around sharply. &quot;What?&quot; 

Leda looked over her shoulder at her. &quot;I thought that was easy enough 
to understand. Tolaris asked me not to tell you about it. If you want 
to know, you&#39;ll have to ask him.&quot; 

Ami gnawed on the edge of her lip as she thought. &quot;Using my hypnotic 
powers to stop a fight is one thing, but you know how I feel about 
having to use it for other purposes. Don&#39;t make me force you to talk,&quot; 
she said quietly. 

Leda looked at her carefully for a moment before walking over to her, 
sliding her arms around her slender waist, and gently kissing her. Ami 
didn&#39;t resist but didn&#39;t yield to her either, something that Leda was 
in a way glad for. A distant part of the brunette&#39;s mind told her that 
if Ami had yielded, she probably would have tried to seduce her on the 
spot. 

Leda broke the kiss after a few seconds and looked into Ami&#39;s eyes, 
watching their steel-blue shade fade into a medium-blue shade as her 
vampiric nature went dormant. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said quietly. 

Ami didn&#39;t know if she was apologizing for the kiss, for not talking, 
or for both. Nor did she particularly care at that moment in time. She 
knew that Leda harbored a semi-secret desire for her, but unlike 
Mina&#39;s hormonal desires, she wouldn&#39;t try to do anything that Ami 
wouldn&#39;t have wanted in one way or another. The only reason she could 
think of for kissing her was to use as a distraction, and 
unfortunately for Ami it worked as her focus was thrown off- balance 
by the tactic. 

&quot;I guess you&#39;re going to be stubborn about this?&quot; Ami asked quietly 
after a few seconds of silence. She received a slow nod in response 
and she signed. &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll leave you alone now. Sleep well,&quot; she 
said as she pulled herself free from Leda&#39;s somewhat intimate embrace. 

&quot;Hey, Ami?&quot; Leda said quietly before she could reach the door. 

Ami paused and turned around to look at her. &quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;Would you stay with me for awhile, at least until I fall asleep?&quot; 
Leda said, still speaking softly. &quot;Thinking about the pictures has 
started to make me miss her again and I.... don&#39;t want to be alone 
right now.&quot; 

Ami remained motionless for a few seconds before she walked over to 
Leda and gave her the same kind of kiss as the one she had received 
only moments before. She was rather surprised when Leda reacted as she 
had, neither resisting nor yielding. She held the kiss for a few 
moments before she took a step back and whispered, &quot;Sorry.&quot; 

She then turned around and quietly left the room, not really wanting 
to see the look in Leda&#39;s slightly-haunted eyes. She was halfway down 
the hall when she heard the bedroom door close quietly, shortly 
followed by the metallic click of the lock being turned. She had 
almost made it to the end of the hall when her sensitive ears heard 
the soft sounds of Leda crying quietly as she leaned against the 
locked door. 

Ami paused and closed her eyes, weighing her desire to go back and 
comfort Leda against what would most likely happen if she did. Another 
day, perhaps, she decided with a heavy sigh as she walked into the 
living room and began to gather her stuff together. She had almost 
finished she her gaze fell on the half-empty bottle of plum wine. 

This really is some good stuff, she thought as she poured a small 
amount of the amethyst liquid into her wine glass and looked around 
for the cork. She found it in the far corner of the room and picked it 
up, briefly studying the wooden object before jamming it back into the 
bottle. She paused long enough to drink what was left in her glass 
before carrying it into the kitchen, putting the bottle back in the 
refrigerator and rinsing out the glass in the sink. 

Ami took one final glance around the apartment to make sure she hadn&#39;t 
forgotten anything as she picked up her backpack. She glanced down the 
hallway with a small sigh and quietly left, making sure to set the 
lock before she closed the door. Hopefully a few hours&#39; rest will make 
her feel better, she thought as she jogged down the apartment steps 
rather than wait for the rather sluggish elevator. 

She had just reached the street across from Leda&#39;s apartment complex 
when a column of bright purple energy rose in the distance and an icy 
wind swept through her body. Oh no.... she thought as her pulse 
started to race. She started to reach for her computer and blinked 
when she realized that she had already retrieved it out of pure 
reflex. 

She opened the compact-sized computer with a practiced flick of her 
wrist and started to scan for the disturbance. The purple light had 
already faded, but there was still enough residual energy for the 
computer&#39;s sensor suite to easily lock onto. A subroutine scanned for 
the carrier waves of the Global Positioning Satellite network, 
triangulated her position, and superimposed a map of the city with the 
fastest route to the objective highlighted in amber. 

Ami glanced quickly glanced around to make sure no one was watching as 
she slid the backpack off of her shoulder. Why do these things always 
seem to happen in the park? she wondered as her hand went to the small 
of her back and pulled her Mercury Wand out of her Lunar Space pocket. 

&quot;Mercury Power!&quot; she yelled as she held the Wand up to the sky. She 
was immediately engulfed in a mass of light and energy as her clothes 
melted into radiance and reformed into her Sailor suit. Tiny bits of 
luminescence gathered together and formed into her tiara while other 
particles of light and energy merged together into sapphire earrings. 

The entire process took only seconds and the mysterious transforming 
energy vanished as quickly as it had come, leaving an upset and 
slightly wary Sailor Mercury standing on the sidewalk with computer in 
hand and a worried look on her delicate features. 

As she reached down to pick up her backpack, the communicator in her 
Lunar Space pocket started beeping frantically. &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; she 
sighed as she strapped the backpack onto her shoulders and retrieved 
her communicator. As soon as she touched the flashing button, Mina&#39;s 
worried face appeared in the tiny display screen, blinking in mild 
surprise. 

&quot;I take it you know what&#39;s going on already?&quot; she asked quickly. 

Mercury shook her head. &quot;Not quite. All I know is that it was a 
focused beam of negatively-charged energy and that it originated from 
the park.&quot; 

&quot;Great,&quot; Mina said with a sigh. &quot;Serena&#39;s still in detention, so it&#39;ll 
have to be just the four of us. Rei and I will meet you there.&quot; 

Mercury sighed. &quot;Three of us. Leda just went to sleep and I don&#39;t 
advise waking her up just yet.&quot; 

Mina blinked. &quot;Are you sure about that? We may need her for this.&quot; 

&quot;As sleep-deprived as she is, she may prove to be more of a hindrance 
than a help,&quot; Mercury pointed out. &quot;And if we need backup, Whisper and 
Ra&#39;vel can teleport here within a matter of seconds.&quot; 

The blonde blew out her breath. &quot;Hope you&#39;re right, Mercury. See you 
in a few,&quot; she said and closed the connection. 

&quot;So do I,&quot; Mercury said to the wall next to her as she closed her end 
of the frequency, put both her communicator and computer back into her 
Lunar Space pocket, and set off at a dead run for the city park. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Alex blinked and leaned briefly on Susan&#39;s arm as the vastness of The 
Dark unfolded around them. &quot;And I thought dimension-shifting with you 
was a major headache....&quot; she breathed softly. 

Susan shot her a reproving look. &quot;If you get headaches, they&#39;re not 
from dimension shifting,&quot; she said mildly. 

Myst wrinkled her nose. &quot;If you think shifting is bad, try being 
caught in a molecular teleport,&quot; she muttered as she looked around the 
area. 

Mephisto chuckled quietly as he also looked around for signs of 
potential danger. &quot;Would you have prefered that I had let you be 
eaten?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m still debating on that,&quot; Myst dourly muttered beneath her breath. 

Alex glanced around the area, blinked hard, and let out her breath 
very slowly. &quot;Sue, this place gives me the creeps....&quot; she whispered 
as she tried to look past the utter darkness that seemed to eminate 
from everywhere. 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Susan replied softly. She turned and gave Alex a mild look 
when the blonde started cussing softly to herself. &quot;Now what?&quot; 

&quot;I know how you are, and if this place is enough to spook you, then I 
want outta here right freaking now,&quot; Alex hissed. 

&quot;Without Michelle?&quot; Susan inquired, already knowing the answer. 

Alex shot her a look darker than the surrounding terrain. &quot;You know 
damn well that I&#39;m not....&quot; 

&quot;Nobody move,&quot; Mephisto interrupted quietly. &quot;We&#39;ve got company.&quot; 

Myst immediately leapt out of Alex&#39;s arms and crouched low on the 
ground while Susan and Alex went into defensive positions. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think it made it here with us,&quot; Alex muttered as Susan absently made a 
snatching motion at the air. 

Susan looked momentarily confused before she realized what she was 
doing. &quot;No, I guess not,&quot; she sighed quietly. &quot;So what&#39;s out there, 
Mephisto?&quot; 

&quot;A shadow wraith, possibly two of them,&quot; Mephisto replied. &quot;Look a bit 
to your right, about fifty yards away.&quot; 

&quot;Where...? Oh, I see,&quot; Susan replied as her eyes narrowed. 

Alex frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t see anything, Sue,&quot; she cautioned as she 
glanced around, trying to see what they were talking about. 

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t be able to see it unless your vision extends into the 
infra- red spectrum,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;What is it doing?&quot; 

&quot;Probably trying to decide if we&#39;re worth the effort of hunting,&quot; 
Mephisto replied quietly. &quot;However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever seen a 
humanoid before, so it&#39;s still sizing things up.&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s another one behind us,&quot; Myst growled as her fur started to 
stick out in a reflex. 

Mephisto glanced over his shoulder and frowned. &quot;Strange,&quot; he 
commented. 

Alex growled softly. &quot;Just tell us what the new problem is.&quot; 

&quot;Shadow wraiths don&#39;t hunt in pairs, do they?&quot; Susan asked. 

&quot;Not that I know of,&quot; Mephisto replied. 

&quot;Wait a sec,&quot; Alex said. &quot;If they don&#39;t hunt in pairs, then what are 
the odds that we&#39;ve been caught between the two of them by purely bad 
luck?&quot; 

&quot;A reasonable deduction,&quot; Mephisto said softly. 

&quot;So, what happens when two wraiths who are hunting the same prey come 
in close proximity to one another?&quot; Alex replied, trying to keep a 
wary eye on something she couldn&#39;t see. 

&quot;Never mind that, we&#39;ve got a new problem,&quot; Myst hissed quietly, her 
tail lashing back and forth furiously. 

Alex looked ready to cry. &quot;Now what?&quot; she asked softly. 

Mephisto looked up and grunted softly. &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a problem 
we&#39;re going to have to worry about for a few minutes.&quot; 

Susan&#39;s focus was on the first shadow wraith and she wasn&#39;t about to 
turn around just yet. &quot;So what is it?&quot; 

&quot;Something is hunting the second wraith,&quot; Mephisto said, a slight note 
of amusement evident in his voice. &quot;I can barely see it myself, but 
it&#39;s energy signature feels like a phantasm.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s an improvement,&quot; Myst said, her voice dripping with 
sarcasm. 

&quot;Energy signature....&quot; Susan whispered to herself. &quot;Of course....&quot; 

&quot;If you people are trying to scare the life out of me, you&#39;re doing a 
remarkable job,&quot; Alex muttered. &quot;Sue, quit talking to yourself and let 
us know what you&#39;re thinking.&quot; 

&quot;Mephisto, how many human souls exist within The Dark?&quot; Susan asked. 

&quot;Not too many, I would think,&quot; Mephisto replied as he continued to 
keep a watchful eye on both the wraith and the phantasm. 

&quot;If that&#39;s the case, then I can probably find Michelle&#39;s soul if I 
search for the energy signature of human souls,&quot; Susan explained. 

&quot;Finally, some good news,&quot; Alex muttered. &quot;Sue, can you hold that 
thought long enough for us to deal with our current situation or do 
you need someone to find you a pencil and piece of paper?&quot; 

&quot;I assure you my short-term memory is quite capable,&quot; Susan said 
dryly. 

Everyone tensed when there was a sudden blur of movement in the 
distance and a high-pitched shriek ripped through the air. The noise 
was quickly followed by the sounds of life-or-death combat as sparks 
of light exploded into existence around both the shadow wraith and the 
phantasm. 

&quot;Tell me that&#39;s a good thing,&quot; Alex said warily. 

&quot;It&#39;s a good thing,&quot; Susan replied, hoping it was the truth. 

&quot;Thank you, I feel so much better now. Now can someone tell me what&#39;s 
going on over there?&quot; Alex said. 

&quot;It appears that the phantasm has a fondness for eating wraiths,&quot; 
Susan observed as she glanced back towards the location of the first 
wraith. &quot;And it appears that the other wraith has no desire to hunt 
anything when another one of its kind is being hunted.&quot; 

&quot;So it seems,&quot; Mephisto said as he glanced at the rapidly retreating 
form of the wraith. &quot;I don&#39;t know how long the wraith is going to be 
able to hold off the phantasm, but now seems like a good time to leave 
the area.&quot; 

&quot;Alright, some good news,&quot; Alex muttered as she bent down and scooped 
up Myst in her arms. &quot;You know, you&#39;re kinda heavy for a kitten. Don&#39;t 
look at me like that, that&#39;s just an observation, not a complaint.&quot; 

&quot;You humans are strange,&quot; Myst muttered. 

&quot;This way,&quot; Mephisto said as he pointed towards a featureless section 
of the neo-void. &quot;I doubt this route will be safer than any other, but 
it does lead towards one of the more desolate areas of The Dark.&quot; 

They moved quickly and in silence, keeping a watchful out in every 
direction and trying to ignore the now-piercing screams coming from 
the fight behind them. Susan waited until the sounds of the battle had 
faded from her slightly enhanced hearing before she stopped and looked 
around the area. 

&quot;Does this look like a safe spot for a few minutes?&quot; she asked. 

The whiskers on Myst&#39;s face twitched briefly. &quot;As safe as any one spot 
in this place can be,&quot; she muttered. 

&quot;There is nothing around us, if that is what you mean,&quot; Mephisto said. 

Susan nodded. &quot;Good. Step back, please,&quot; she said as she closed her 
eyes and started to concentrate. 

Alex muttered something inaudible beneath her breath as they all took 
a few steps away from Susan and watched her carefully. Everyone 
blinked as the dark scars on her back seemed to ripple briefly before 
ballooning outward and reshaping themselves into a pair of bat-like 
wings. 

&quot;You know I hate it when you do that,&quot; Alex muttered as she 
involuntarily shivered at the sight. 

Susan&#39;s head turned to one side and her eyes opened briefly, revealing 
the glowing red irises and fixing Alex with a piercing stare. &quot;Would 
you prefer that I not search for Michelle&#39;s soul?&quot; she said, her voice 
taking on a rather sultry tone. 

Alex couldn&#39;t bring herself to look into those demonic eyes and 
instead focused on the gray cat she was holding. &quot;Just hurry up, 
please,&quot; she muttered as she nervously stroked Myst. 

Susan continued to look at her for another moment before closing her 
eyes and concentrating once more. Her wings flexed briefly before 
spreading out to their full length and locking into place. As they 
watched, tiny motes of dull white energy began to form at the very 
tips of her wings and lazily made their way across the leathery 
surface towards the small of her back. 

Mephisto silently moved to stand behind Alex&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I take it 
her demonic form bothers you,&quot; he whispered softly to her, his lips 
almost brushing against her ear as he spoke. 

&quot;Yeah, kinda,&quot; she whispered back. &quot;I mean, she&#39;s served the throne 
since Queen Serenity&#39;s great-great-grandmother was in diapers, and I&#39;d 
like to think that I know her quite well, but I&#39;ve never really gotten 
used to just how dark her nature can be.&quot; 

&quot;You say that as if being from the Underworld is a bad thing,&quot; Susan 
said flatly as she slowly started to turn in place, her wings moving 
like a radar dish. &quot;Might I remind you that not all who dwell there 
are evil?&quot; 

Alex blushed a deep shade of crimson as she remembered how much 
sharper Susan&#39;s hearing was in her demonic form. &quot;I know that, Sue, 
and I never said anything about being evil.&quot; 

&quot;You implied it, did you not?&quot; 

Alex sighed quietly to herself, wondering yet again how Susan&#39;s 
demonic voice could be so sultry and alluring, yet so harsh at the 
same time. &quot;We&#39;ve discussed that one before, Sue,&quot; she said quietly, 
wishing she could forget that particular conversation so long ago. 

Susan said nothing as her wings swept back and forth, the tiny motes 
still forming at her wing tips and collecting at the small of her 
back. After a few moments of uncomfortable silence, she suddenly 
stopped in place and frowned. 

&quot;You sense something?&quot; Mephisto asked quietly. 

The motes on her wings started to glow brighter as more power was 
drawn out of the air and into her wings, illuminating the network of 
tiny veins that ran along their length. &quot;I think so, but it&#39;s so faint 
I&#39;m not quite sure. Plus there seems to be some sort of interference 
in that area.&quot; 

Myst blinked. &quot;What kind of interference?&quot; 

&quot;If I knew, I would have told you.&quot; 

Alex sighed. &quot;Leave her alone, Myst, she&#39;s only like that when she&#39;s 
in her demonic form,&quot; the blonde whispered as quietly as she could. 

&quot;Which direction is it coming from?&quot; Mephisto asked quietly. 

&quot;From there,&quot; Susan replied as she pointed almost directly behind him. 

He looked at the surrounding terrain first before turning to look 
towards the specified direction. &quot;Would you say the disturbance is 
about an hour&#39;s walk away from here?&quot; he asked, trying to ignore the 
sudden icyness forming in his insides. 

Susan opened her eyes as she sought to gauge the distance. &quot;That seems 
to be about right,&quot; she said after a moment. The motes on her wings 
faded into nothingness as her wings flexed before folding against her 
back. 

&quot;Balor,&quot; Mephisto said quietly. 

Alex grimaced in pain as Myst twitched in shock, her claws reflexively 
extending and accidentally scratching Alex&#39;s bare arm. &quot;I take it 
that&#39;s not a good sign?&quot; the blonde asked as she gave the kitten a 
dark look. 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Myst aplogized quietly. 

&quot;Where have I heard that name before?&quot; Susan asked, her glowing red 
eyes narrowing as she tried to remember. 

Mephisto shook his head. &quot;It is not the same one as you are thinking 
of. He is not the greater demon of the lower planes but a Shinma who 
gains his power from using other souls.&quot; 

&quot;So that&#39;s it,&quot; Susan said. &quot;The sheer number of souls in his 
possession was creating the interference. Interesting.&quot; 

&quot;Is Michelle there?&quot; Alex asked. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I think so,&quot; Susan said. 

&quot;If that is the case, then freeing her from Balor&#39;s grasp will not be 
an easy task,&quot; Mephisto cautioned. 

&quot;You said he&#39;s a Shinma like yourself?&quot; Susan asked archly. Mephisto 
nodded and she smiled, revealing a pair of very sharp fangs on both 
her upper and lower jaws. &quot;Then leave him to me.&quot; 

Alex closed her eyes and did her best not to shiver at the note of 
dark pleasure and anticipation that had made its way into Susan&#39;s 
alluring voice. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she said quietly and started walking 
towards Balor&#39;s lair. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Molly was in the process of drawing in enough air for a third scream 
when his hand gently clamped over her mouth. It didn&#39;t prevent her 
from breathing, but it effectively blocked any sound she might have 
made. 

&quot;If you will listen for a moment, you will find that screaming isn&#39;t 
necessary,&quot; he explained softly as his ears twitched, still ringing 
slightly from her previous screams. &quot;I&#39;m not going to hurt you, I just 
need to ask you where I can find someone.&quot; 

Molly&#39;s brain overcame her screaming reflex long enough for his words 
to register. Her lungs and throat were burning from the exertion of 
screaming at the top of her lungs, and her blood was a solid sheet of 
ice from mortal fear. It took her a few seconds to overcome her 
temporary paralysis long enough to nod slightly at him. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said as he let his hand fall to his side. 

&quot;Wh..... wh..... what..... are you?&quot; she whispered as she started to 
step back from him. 

&quot;A visitor from another world,&quot; he explained as his tail twitched with 
slight impatience. &quot;My name is Reish&#39;id, and I&#39;m looking for the one 
called Sailor Jupiter.&quot; 

Eight different thoughts tried to cram themselves into her brain at 
once, resulting in another moment of mental paralysis. &quot;Sailor 
Jupiter?&quot; she said as her mind selected the easiest concept to deal 
with. 

Reish&#39;id nodded. &quot;Yes. Do you know where I can find her?&quot; His whiskers 
twitched briefly as he noticed the mental chaos reflected in her eyes 
and he sighed quietly. &quot;I assure you that you are not in any sort of 
danger, miss, so you can try to relax and breathe normally.&quot; 

Molly blinked as she realized that she had stopped breathing again and 
let her breath out as evenly as she could. She was still in a profound 
state of shock and it took quite some time for her brain to override 
her reflexes and sort things out. &quot;Sailor Jupiter?&quot; she stammered 
again. &quot;I.... no one knows who or where she is.... She just shows up 
with the other Sailor Scouts when trouble happens....&quot; 

Reish&#39;id grunted quietly. &quot;I see,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Tell me, what 
would be the quickest way to get the Sailor Scouts&#39; attention?&quot; 

Molly tried to think, but the sight of a giant, talking panther kept 
interfering with her thoughts. &quot;Umm.... I.... uh....&quot; 

The felinoid warrior chuckled softly to himself. In another time and 
place, he thought, this could get amusing. &quot;Please sit down for a 
moment. I fear you&#39;re on the verge of fainting and that wouldn&#39;t help 
matters.&quot; 

She blinked twice in mild confusion before she slowly knelt down on 
the grass, her green eyes nearly triple their usual diameter. &quot;Why.... 
why are you here?&quot; she said, her breathing still rather unstable. 

He dropped to all fours and started to stretch out a hind leg. 
&quot;Simple, really,&quot; he said. &quot;I need to return a few things to Sailor 
Jupiter. She sort of left them behind during her last trip into my 
world.&quot; 

She blinked. &quot;Your world?&quot; she said before something bubbled up from 
the depths of her memory and surged into her consciousness. &quot;Are.... 
are you from the Negaverse?&quot; 

Reish&#39;id froze in mid-motion and looked at her, his almond-shaped 
purple irises widening against their yellow background. &quot;How do you 
know of the Negaverse?&quot; he asked in amazement. &quot;I thought only the 
Sailor Scouts and their allies knew of it.&quot; 

Molly was taken aback by his reaction. &quot;I was told about your society 
by someone I met,&quot; she said carefully, not sure how much she should 
reveal to him. 

He tilted his head to one side in curiosity. &quot;May I ask what his name 
was? I might know him,&quot; he added. 

&quot;His name was Nephlyte....&quot; She jumped as Reish&#39;id suddenly leapt to 
his feet, his jaw falling open in amazement. 

&quot;General Nephlyte?&quot; he said incrediously. He searched his memory for 
the name that had been attached to the copy of the report he had 
managed to acquire and narrowed his eyes. &quot;Your name is Molly, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot; 

Molly&#39;s eyes grew even wider, her eyeballs looking like they would 
fall out any second now. &quot;How...?&quot; she managed to choke out before her 
brain locked up once more with shock. 

He sighed quietly to himself as he realized that his task might take a 
considerable time longer than anticipated. &quot;Your name became known to 
us when Nephlyte turned against Zoicite in an attempt to protect you 
from her minion.&quot; He sighed yet again as she started to show more 
signs of an impending fainting spell at the information. 

&quot;Before you faint, can you think of a way I can get in contact with 
the Sailor Scouts?&quot; he asked softly as she briefly struggled to retain 
what little higher brain functions she had available. 

&quot;I.... umm.... let me think for a moment....&quot; she said weakly. 

Reish&#39;id tried his best to give her what he thought would look like a 
reassuring smile. &quot;Please, take your time. I know things must be very 
confusing for you right now.&quot; 

No kidding, Molly managed to think. Now let&#39;s think here.... what 
usually happens a few minutes before Sailor Moon shows up.... Monsters 
everywhere, city airport gets taken over, cruise liner gets taken 
over, major bus route gets taken over.... very, very few people 
killed, considering.... !!! 

&quot;Energy,&quot; she blurted out as she looked up at him. &quot;In the past, lots 
of really weird monsters were running around and draining energy out 
of everybody. I think the Sailor Scouts picked up on something that 
went on while they were draining people.&quot; 

Reish&#39;id nodded to himself. It makes sense, he thought. Sailor Mercury 
does have that scanner of hers and Leda told me about their 
sensitivity to what they called &#39;dark vibes&#39; of energy. 
Interesting.... 

Molly blinked as he stretched and quickly stood up. &quot;Wait, what are 
you going to do?&quot; 

&quot;I am merely going to create a beacon for the Sailor Scouts to find 
me,&quot; he said as he held his hands over his head. He paused and gave 
her a mild look. &quot;This won&#39;t do anything to you, but you might not 
want to look directly into the beam,&quot; he cautioned. 

She blinked again. &quot;What...?&quot; 

&quot;Dark Energy Electrify,&quot; Reish&#39;id intoned as he focused his powers and 
sent a column of Dark Energy shooting into the sky. He was able to 
keep the residual energy backlash to a minimum, but the 
negatively-charged energy still caused the fur on his arms to tingle 
and stick out. He kept up the beam for a few seconds before letting it 
disperse into the atmosphere and letting his arms fall to his sides. 

&quot;I think that should be sufficient to get their attention,&quot; he said 
with a satisfied flick of his tail. He looked up at her and frowned, 
his whiskers twitching slightly. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; 

Molly grunted softly and she wiped the tears out of her eyes. &quot;Sorry, 
I didn&#39;t quite know what you meant,&quot; she said as she waited for her 
temporarily overloaded retinas to quit burning. 

&quot;My apologies,&quot; he said sincerely. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;ll be okay?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said as she opened her eyes, squinting as the 
light caused her some minor discomfort. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any worse 
than the time Melvin caught me by surprise with his new flash camera.&quot; 

Reish&#39;id chuckled quietly to himself as he dropped to all fours and 
began to stretch out his hind leg once more. Old age must be catching 
up to me, he mused as he worked on relaxing the muscle. &quot;If I may ask 
a personal question, Molly, how old are you?&quot; he asked out of idle 
curiosity. 

Molly blinked at the sudden question. &quot;I just turned sixteen. Why do 
you ask? And are you alright?&quot; she asked quickly when the fur on his 
tail suddenly stuck straight out in surprise. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; he assured her as he quickly preened the fur back into 
place. &quot;It&#39;s just the vast time difference between humans and denizens 
that keeps surprising most people. Do you have any idea how old 
General Nephlyte was when you two met?&quot; 

Molly gave him a slightly wary look. &quot;He looked to be somewhere 
between his late-twenties and early thirties. He never told me his 
exact age, though.&quot; 

Reish&#39;id chuckled. &quot;Perhaps I should leave it at that. I&#39;m not sure if 
L.... I mean, Sailor Jupiter is any indication of how shock-resistant 
humans can be, but I&#39;d rather not put any more strain on you as it 
is,&quot; he said in an even tone that belied how mortified he was at 
almost revealing Sailor Jupiter&#39;s human identity. 

The slip went right over Molly&#39;s head. &quot;You mean he&#39;s not as old as he 
seems to be?&quot; she said slowly. 

He shook his head. &quot;Far from it.&quot; 

She took a deep breath and tried to steel what was left of her nerves. 
&quot;How old is he?&quot; 

Reish&#39;id gave her a measured look. &quot;Perhaps you should wait until your 
body hasn&#39;t been over-stressed before you ask,&quot; he cautioned gently. 

Molly shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m too young to have a heart-attack, if that&#39;s 
what you&#39;re worried about,&quot; she replied. &quot;And if I can handle sitting 
down in the middle of the park and having a conversation with a giant, 
talking panther from another world, I think I can handle discovering 
that the man I fell in love with is a little older than he appears to 
be.&quot; 

He nodded his head slowly. &quot;Very well. A month before his promotion to 
Commander General and subsequent assignment to Earth, Nephlyte 
celebrated his one hundred and thirty-eighth decade of life,&quot; he said 
evenly. 

Okay, she thought as her mind automatically did the math, that puts 
his age at.... &quot;You&#39;re joking, right?&quot; she said, not entirely 
convinced at the unbelievably high figure. 

Reish&#39;id raised a furry eyebrow in response. &quot;I assure you that I am 
not making a joke,&quot; he said evenly. &quot;General Nephlyte is almost 
fourteen hundred years old.&quot; 

Molly was suddenly grateful for the fact that she was sitting down, 
having the suspicion that she would have keeled over if she were 
standing up. &quot;You know....&quot; she said slowly as it began to register, 
&quot;That does explain more than a few things about him....&quot; 

&quot;Indeed?&quot; he asked, curious. 

&quot;Hold it right there!&quot; a voice cut across the park. &quot;Don&#39;t move or 
you&#39;ll regret it!&quot; 

At least their response time is excellent, Reish&#39;id thought as he 
sighed and remained in place. &quot;I assume you are the Sailor Scouts?&quot; he 
said as he turned to look at the two figures cautiously advancing 
towards him. 

&quot;Yup, that&#39;s us,&quot; Venus said as she kept her finger pointed at him, 
the twin crescents of her Crescent Beam already merged at her 
fingertip. &quot;Now let her go.&quot; 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Sailor Mars asked as she kept a wary eye on what 
she thought was a giant alien panther. You know, she thought to 
herself, I could have sworn I&#39;ve seen this somewhere else before.... 

Molly cautiously glanced between her strange visitor and the two 
Sailor Scouts. &quot;I&#39;m fine, but I think he just wants to talk to you.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Reish&#39;id said as he looked glanced at Venus. &quot;My name is 
Reish&#39;id, and I&#39;m looking to get in contact with Sailor Jupiter.&quot; 

Venus blinked and exchanged startled glances with Mars, her 
concentration starting to waver slightly. &quot;Wait a minute....&quot; the 
blonde said slowly. &quot;Say your name again?&quot; 

&quot;Reish&#39;id,&quot; the felinoid warrior said slowly, slightly amused at their 
reaction. &quot;I take it you&#39;ve never ran across a denizen who wants to 
talk as opposed to starting a fight?&quot; 

Mars&#39;s jaw fell open. &quot;You mean to tell me that you&#39;re Jupiter&#39;s 
boyfriend?&quot; she said in utter amazement. 

Reish&#39;id&#39;s tail twitched slightly in amusement. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if the 
term applies in this sense, but I am the one she was with during her 
vacation in the Negaverse.&quot; 

Venus let her breath out slowly as she lowered her arm, carefully 
letting the Crescent Beam energy dissapate from her fingertip. &quot;Oh 
boy....&quot; she said softly. &quot;This is going to get interesting.&quot; 

&quot;Trust me, it already is,&quot; Mars replied quietly. 

Molly opened her mouth to say something but remained silent as she 
heard pounding footsteps behind her and turned to look. &quot;Sailor 
Mercury, over here!&quot; she said to the figure on the other side of the 
street. 

Mercury continued to run until she got close enough to really see what 
was going on. Venus suppressed a giggle as Mercury&#39;s eyes widened as 
she applied the proverbial brakes and skidded to a stop several feet 
away from Molly and Reish&#39;id. &quot;My goodness....&quot; she breathed softly as 
she assessed the situation and discovered no impending danger. 

Reish&#39;id&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly as he recognized Mercury from what 
Leda had told him. &quot;Well met, Sailor Mercury,&quot; he said slowly. 

Mercury blinked in surprise at what Tolaris had told her was a rather 
formal, if outdated, greeting. &quot;Well met, Warrior,&quot; she replied 
cautiously, hoping that was the proper form of address. She blinked 
again as she realized that she had said it in the denizen language 
instead of her own. 

Reish&#39;id laughed quietly. &quot;Indeed,&quot; he said in English. &quot;Commander 
Tolaris has taught you well, considering he never mastered the accent 
on that particular dialect.&quot; 

Mercury blinked yet again, unsure of what to do. Sailor Mars spared 
her further confusion by clearing her throat loudly. &quot;So what brings 
you to Earth, and what did you want to talk about?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;I&#39;m here for a rather simple reason, really,&quot; he said as he walked 
over to a thick bush. He reached inside and pulled out a rather 
beat-up backpack that looked to be holding a considerable amount of 
stuff inside. &quot;Your friend Jupiter left this behind during her trip 
and I wanted to return it to her. Do you know where I can find her?&quot; 

Both Mars and Venus glanced towards Mercury as she coughed delicately. 
&quot;Umm.... well, to be honest, she&#39;s had a very rough day and she&#39;s 
sleeping right now, so I don&#39;t advise waking her up. At least, not for 
a few hours,&quot; she amended as she saw the look on his face. 

&quot;Hey, Mercury?&quot; Venus asked cautiously. &quot;Say your father drops in for 
a surprise visit and you just happen to be taking a nap. Don&#39;t you 
think you&#39;d want to be woken up?&quot; 

Everyone blinked as Mercury&#39;s expression darkened considerably. &quot;Not 
for him,&quot; she said, her voice cold enough to freeze blood. &quot;Poor 
choice of example aside, your point has been duly recognized,&quot; she 
said, her tone starting to thaw ever so slightly. 

&quot;Looks like someone else has been having a rough day,&quot; Mars muttered, 
drawing a sharp look from Mercury and an amused look from Reish&#39;id. 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; he whispered in the denizen language, speaking soft enough 
so only Mercury could hear him. &quot;Or perhaps you are letting your 
vampiric nature get the better of you.&quot; He blinked and involuntarily 
took a step back as her head swung around to fix him with a chilling 
gaze. 

&quot;What do you know of being a vampire?&quot; she said, equally as quiet and 
in the same language. 

&quot;I have dealt with them long enough to know that the greatest danger 
they pose is not to others but to themselves,&quot; he replied softly. &quot;The 
darkness within is a deadly adversary indeed.&quot; 

Mercury remained silent as she regarded him carefully, ignoring the 
looks of confusion and curiosity from the other Sailor Scouts. Molly 
was completely lost, not being able to understand the language Mercury 
and Reish&#39;id were using. She looked at Sailor Venus and frowned 
lightly at the look of complete puzzlement on the blonde&#39;s face. Well, 
if they don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, she reasoned, then I guess I can 
feel better about being totally clueless. 

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Mercury finally asked, still speaking in the 
denizen language. &quot;Aside from wanting to see Jupiter.&quot; 

&quot;Merely to better understand your nature,&quot; Reish&#39;id replied softly. 
&quot;She only told be a little bit about you and I admit curiosity with 
regards to your vampirism. But I&#39;m afraid that will have to wait until 
another day, for time is running short and the longer we stay in the 
open like this, the greater chance there is for discovery.&quot; 

&quot;So how are you planning to return to the Negaverse once this is 
over?&quot; Mercury said, switching to English so the others could 
understand. She knew that Venus&#39;s grasp of the denizen language was 
almost equal to her own, but she had her doubts about Mars&#39;s mastery 
of the alien tongue. 

&quot;I&#39;ve borrowed this from an old friend for a few hours,&quot; he said as he 
held up an iridescent purple gem. 

Sailor Venus frowned. &quot;Just how many of those things exist? I was told 
only a handful.&quot; 

The tip of Reish&#39;id&#39;s ear twitched briefly. &quot;Actually, several dozen 
Silkworm crystals exist now. Only a few existed naturally until 
General Rune learned how to grow them properly, which I understand has 
taken her close to six centuries to do so.&quot; 

&quot;Several dozen?&quot; Mercury said, a ball of ice forming in her gut. 

&quot;Sounds like an invasion plan to me,&quot; Mars muttered. 

&quot;Invasion?&quot; Molly asked cautiously. 

Reish&#39;id grunted as Molly&#39;s complexion paled slightly. &quot;Perhaps we 
should discuss matters when time isn&#39;t so pressing,&quot; he said evenly. 
&quot;Sailor Mercury, will you take me to see Sailor Jupiter?&quot; 

&quot;You know she&#39;ll be royally pissed if you don&#39;t,&quot; Venus warned 
Mercury. &quot;Especially after that mood she was in last week.&quot; 

&quot;I know,&quot; Mercury sighed. &quot;Listen, you two can go ahead and head back 
to whatever you were doing. I&#39;ll take care of things from here.&quot; 

Venus shot a questioning look at Mars and the priestess nodded. 
&quot;Fine,&quot; Venus said slowly, &quot;But if anything comes up, don&#39;t hesitate 
to scream for backup.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll give you a call on the communicator since screaming will most 
likely only give me a sore throat,&quot; Mercury replied dryly. 

&quot;Deal,&quot; Mars said and looked at Molly. &quot;You want us to take you home 
or anything?&quot; 

Molly sighed and shook her head. &quot;Actually, I think I&#39;ll just stay 
here and relax for a while. There&#39;s suddenly an awful lot on my mind 
that I need to think about.&quot; 

Venus smiled. &quot;Hey, we understand perfectly. After all,&quot; she added as 
she gave Reish&#39;id a curious look, &quot;It&#39;s not every day that you get to 
meet a talking panther from another world.&quot; 

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t find me too disturbing, Miss Venus,&quot; Reish&#39;id 
replied with a soft growl of amusement. 

&quot;She&#39;s disturbed enough as it is,&quot; Mercury replied, drawing a badly 
suppressed giggle from Mars and a dour look from Venus. &quot;Since walking 
down 12th Avenue in broad daylight would be a very bad idea, I&#39;m going 
to need to borrow the crystal to open a wormhole into her apartment.&quot; 

&quot;Time to boogie,&quot; Mars said as she tugged on Sailor Venus&#39;s skirt bow. 
&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go before something else happens.&quot; 

Venus shrugged and waved to everyone. &quot;Catch ya later,&quot; she said 
simply and started jogging down the path. Mars started jogging to keep 
up with her, muttering toxic comments to herself about having to run. 

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;ll be alright?&quot; Mercury asked Molly as she accepted 
the Silkworm crystal from Reish&#39;id. 

Molly nodded. &quot;Yeah, just give me a few hours to calm down and all. 
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; she assured her. 

&quot;You know, there has to be an easier way to get in touch with you in 
case of emergency,&quot; Reish&#39;id commented as a swirling maelstrom of 
energy opened in front of Mercury. 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Mercury replied softly. &quot;Follow me,&quot; she said as she 
stepped into the wormhole. 

&quot;Thank you for your help, Molly,&quot; Reish&#39;id said as he paused at the 
edge of the vortex. &quot;Hopefully we can meet again under better 
circumstances.&quot; 

Molly blinked and could only nod in reply at his words. Strange, she 
thought as she watched the wormhole collapse in on itself after he had 
passed through. What did he mean by better circumstances? 

She blinked again as another wormhole opened up a few feet away from 
where the first had opened. As she watched, Reish&#39;id stepped back out, 
picked up the forgotten backpack, shrugged to himself, and stepped 
back into the maelestrom. 

A smile started to spread across her lips at the image. He may be a 
big, talking panther from another world, but he has those days just 
like every other life-form in this universe, she thought in mild 
amusement as the whirling vortex vanished into nothingness. 

I wonder what other surprises this day has in store? she thought 
before she laid back against the cool grass and let her mind try to 
sort out the chaos in her brain. As if this day could get any 
stranger.... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

You are going to die a slow, painful death, Leda thought darkly as the 
incessant knocking on her bedroom door woke her up. I just fell 
asleep, and now you want to talk to me. She growled softly to herself 
as she got out of bed and put on an old bath robe. 

The person on the other side of the door knocked yet again, drawing a 
dark look from Leda. &quot;I&#39;m up already,&quot; she growled, adding a decidedly 
profane descriptive word to the end of her statement. She marched 
across the room, unlocked the door, and threw it open with enough 
force to rattle the hinges. Seeing Mercury standing in the hallway 
only served to further increase her blood pressure. 

&quot;Bitch, this had better be....&quot; was as far as she got before Mercury 
reached out, grabbed her jaw in an iron grip, and twisted it to the 
left, forcing the brunette to look down the hallway. 

&quot;Is he worth it?&quot; Mercury asked softly, not currently having enough 
patience to deal with Leda&#39;s present temperment in her usual fashion. 

Leda&#39;s eyes grew impossibly wide at the sight of a black panther 
sitting in the middle of the hallway. &quot;Good afternoon,&quot; Reish&#39;id said 
calmly. &quot;I hope you&#39;ll forgive the disturbance.&quot; He chuckled softly as 
Leda cussed in surprise at the unexpected visit. &quot;I see you haven&#39;t 
changed much,&quot; he said in amusement. 

Mercury sighed as she released her hold on Leda and took a step back. 
&quot;Do us both a favor and look before you get hostile next time, okay?&quot; 
she said in a slightly weary tone. 

The shock had worn off to the point where Leda could think coherently. 
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; she said in amazement, unconsciously 
rubbing at a sore spot on her jaw. 

&quot;Visiting you,&quot; Reish&#39;id replied dryly. &quot;That, and I wanted to return 
these,&quot; he said as he held up the backpack she had left behind during 
her vacation in the Negaverse. 

&quot;Are you awake yet?&quot; Mercury asked, giving Leda a measured look. 

&quot;I am now,&quot; Leda replied sheepishly. &quot;Sorry about going off on you, 
but I had just fallen asleep....&quot; 

Reish&#39;id walked over to her and brushed his tail across the base of 
her throat. &quot;I apologize for having her wake you up, but I thought 
that you would at least like to say hello for a few moments,&quot; he 
purred softly. 

Leda chuckled as she wrapped her arms around him and hugged him 
tightly. &quot;I think I can forgive the both of you,&quot; she said as she 
rubbed her cheek in his dark fur. &quot;Umm, how long are you going to be 
here?&quot; 

&quot;I have to return the Silkworm crystal to Maq&#39;i in roughly three 
hours,&quot; he explained. &quot;Which leaves me enough time to pay you a short 
visit.&quot; 

&quot;Mmmm,&quot; the brunette hummed to herself. &quot;I think I can stay awake for 
another three hours....&quot; 

Sailor Mercury coughed lightly to herself. &quot;Just make sure you go to 
bed afterwards and sleep until dawn. All we need is to have to put up 
with your temper for another day.&quot; 

Leda sighed quietly and cast a sidelong glance at her friend. &quot;Hey, 
Mercury?&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Do us a favor and disappear, and I don&#39;t 
mean using your powers of hypnotic invisibility.&quot; 

Mercury blinked and gave Reish&#39;id a measured look. &quot;Can I leave you 
two alone or should I have to worry about various denizen powers 
running rampant?&quot; 

Leda sighed again, knowing exactly what she meant. &quot;Everything will be 
fine as soon as you go away, Mercury. Thanks for dropping by and I&#39;ll 
see you tomorrow at school.&quot; 

&quot;Leda....&quot; Mercury started to say. 

The brunette fixed her with a piercing gaze. &quot;Go,&quot; she said firmly. 

The vampire sighed, having enough experience in dealing with Leda to 
know when she was just being tempermental and when the line was being 
drawn. &quot;Take care,&quot; she said quietly as she started to walk down the 
hallway. She paused at the end of the corridor and cast a look over 
her shoulder. 

Leda was still tightly hugging Reish&#39;id, her cheek continuing to brush 
against his as she spoke softly to him. He purred softly in response, 
his tail arching around his body to wrap around her wrist in what 
looked to Mercury to be an unmistakable gesture. 

To each their own, Mercury thought as she remembered the fact that her 
own boyfriend and lover was from another world. Sighing softly to 
herself, she willed herself to become invisible and left the 
apartment, quietly closing the door behind her. 

Leda heard the door close and smiled to herself. Took her long enough, 
she thought before looking up into Reish&#39;id&#39;s purple-on-yellow eyes. 
&quot;So what should we do with our three hours of time together?&quot; she 
asked softly. 

&quot;If you are as tired as I think you are, very little,&quot; he admonished 
her. &quot;I do need to show you something, however,&quot; he said as he 
extracted himself from her embrace. &quot;It took me longer than I had 
anticipated, but your suit hood is finally finished.&quot; 

Leda blinked as she remembered about the suit. &quot;Ooo, good. Thank you,&quot; 
she said as she planted a kiss on the tip of his ear. &quot;Let me go 
change so you can sew it on.&quot; 

&quot;Sewing it on isn&#39;t necessary and would probably only serve to 
restrict your head&#39;s range of motion,&quot; he explained as he carefully 
opened her backpack and took the folded pelt out. &quot;Here, just put it 
on like this....&quot; 

Leda slid the dark fur pelt over her head and blinked. &quot;Umm, I can&#39;t 
see out of this thing....&quot; she said. The hood covered her entire head 
and looked almost exactly like the head of a felinoid warrior, 
complete with rather wicked-looking canine teeth protruding from the 
lips. The only discernable difference was that the eyes were a 
featureless black, giving the head a very demonic look. &quot;And what is 
this thing pressed against my chin?&quot; 

&quot;That is the control panel for the sensor systems,&quot; Reish&#39;id 
explained. &quot;Press your chin against it and move it to the right until 
it clicks on.&quot; 

It took her a few seconds to figure out how to do it right, but as 
soon as it clicked her senses were almost overwhelmed by the sudden 
deluge of input. The hood&#39;s eyes began to glow white and the whiskers 
began to twitch in a random pattern as the various electronics powered 
up. The catlike ears on the top briefly rotated like radar dishes 
before orienting forward. 

&quot;What is this?&quot; Leda said, her voice being electronically altered and 
projected from the &#39;mouth&#39; of her hood. &quot;This is too weird....&quot; 

&quot;Look at me,&quot; Reish&#39;id said simply. 

The featureless white eyes blinked a couple of times as they mimicked 
the movements of Leda&#39;s real eyelids and focused on him. Her ears 
automatically reoriented on him and her whiskers twitched as they 
scanned the immediate area, both sending various data to the small 
optic device inside the hood. The device, rather than try to act as a 
display for her to read, used a series of specially-built microlasers 
to imprint the desired images directly onto her retinal nerves, in 
effect acting as a virtual-reality system. 

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Reish&#39;id said as she uttered a string of profane oaths. 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized. &quot;But this is way too cool.... I think this is 
like how Mercury&#39;s Virtual Visor works. Umm, is there a way I can 
filter this down some? Information is nice, but I currently don&#39;t need 
to see what your circulatory system looks like....&quot; 

Reish&#39;id chuckled. &quot;You can cycle through the sensors by pressing up 
and down on the chin pad. It&#39;s a rather over-simplified and crude 
method, I&#39;m afraid, but it was the only one I thought would prove to 
be effective.&quot; 

&quot;Hey, not a problem....&quot; she breathed as she spent a few minutes 
learning how to manipulate the various sensors. &quot;Whoa, this is nice,&quot; 
she said when she came across a setting that allowed her to see 
thermal traces through most solid objects. &quot;I&#39;ll bet Mercury&#39;s toy 
doesn&#39;t have this sort of thing.&quot; 

&quot;Probably not, since the sensor suite needed is rather sizable, even 
if you manage to minmize it as much as possible,&quot; he explained. 

She continued to experiment with the settings for a few moments before 
the electronic eyes went dark as she switched everything off. &quot;Mmm, 
this is wonderful, furball. Thank you,&quot; she said as she removed the 
hood and took a deep breath. &quot;The only complaint is it gets a little 
stuffy after a bit. Not that it&#39;s not ventilated enough,&quot; she said 
quickly as he blinked, &quot;It&#39;s just all that fur pressing against my 
face.&quot; 

He raised a fuzzy eyebrow. &quot;I thought you said you like the feel of 
fur against your skin,&quot; he murmured softly as he nuzzled her neck. 

&quot;But not when it&#39;s up my nose, furball,&quot; she said with a grin. 

&quot;A minor detail,&quot; he growled softly as his tongue brushed across her 
bare throat, eliciting a soft noise from her. 

&quot;Hey now,&quot; she protested softly. 

&quot;Sorry, reflex,&quot; he purred quietly. 

&quot;I&#39;ll bet,&quot; she said. She would have said more, but her breath was 
suddenly caught up in a massive yawn. She tried to suppress it and 
failed rather miserably. 

&quot;Tired?&quot; he asked softly. 

&quot;You could say that,&quot; she admitted as she nuzzled his ear. 

&quot;Perhaps we should do as your friend suggested and put you to bed,&quot; he 
said as his tail wrapped itself around her wrist. 

&quot;Mmmmmmmmmm,&quot; she purred as she thought about it. &quot;It&#39;d be rude to go 
to sleep now that you&#39;re here and under a time limit....&quot; 

&quot;Not if I&#39;m with you, Leda,&quot; he replied. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d mind 
holding you for a few hours. Shall we go?&quot; he asked as he carefully 
picked her up in his arms. 

&quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Putting you to bed,&quot; he replied as he carried her down the hallway 
and into her bedroom. &quot;After all, you wouldn&#39;t want to move once you 
got all comfortable and all, would you?&quot; 

Leda chuckled to herself. &quot;True, but getting really comfortable is 
going to take some time,&quot; she said with a sly grin. 

Reish&#39;id blinked, unsure of what he had just missed. &quot;How so?&quot; he 
asked as he carefully set her down. 

&quot;Forgotten already?&quot; she asked as she toyed with the sash on her robe. 
&quot;I know you&#39;re old, but I thought your kind didn&#39;t get senile. At 
least, not for another few centuries at least....&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps you should remind me,&quot; he growled softly as he understood 
what she had in mind. Part of him was genuinely concerned for her 
well-being given her apparent state of sleep-deprivation, but another 
part of him thought that she knew her limits well enough to know what 
she was doing. 

&quot;Since you put it that way....&quot; she replied as she tugged on the sash 
and let the robe fall to the floor. 

&quot;Perhaps there is something to be said for being young,&quot; he purred in 
appreciation as he leaned forward and drew his tongue across her 
throat. 

&quot;They say you&#39;re only as young as the one you feel....&quot; she quipped as 
she ran her fingers through his short, dark fur. 

Reish&#39;id declined to reply to her comment, instead concentrating on 
the current situation at hand. It wasn&#39;t long before most thoughts of 
humor left them both and the feeling of renewed love filled them, a 
love that even being worlds apart couldn&#39;t diminish. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Molly sighed to herself as the headache securely lodged itself in the 
middle of her forehead. This is going to be one of those nights, 
alright, she thought dourly to herself. Perhaps it&#39;s a good thing Mom 
still has some of that stuff with coedine in it.... 

The sensation of someone poking her in the shoulder scared the 
daylights out her and she jumped up, a piercing cry of surprise 
escaping past her lips before she could even think about trying to 
suppress it. 

&quot;Whoa, calm down,&quot; Serena said as she took a step back. &quot;What&#39;s got 
you all worked up?&quot; 

&quot;Serena,&quot; Molly breathed in relief as she clutched her chest, trying 
to calm her pounding heart by sheer force of will. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about 
that, you just scared the jeepers out of me.&quot; 

Serena gave her a partially amused look. &quot;Well, seeing how I&#39;ve been 
trying to get your attention for the past two minutes, I thought 
poking you would do the trick. Are you sure you&#39;re alright?&quot; 

The redhead let out her breath and sat back down on the grass. &quot;Yeah, 
I&#39;m fine. I just seem to have an awful lot on my mind as of late,&quot; she 
said. 

Serena nodded and sat down next to her best friend. &quot;So what&#39;s got you 
so strung out, Mol? I know you get a little scatter-brained every now 
and then, but I thought you didn&#39;t do the zoning-out thing.&quot; 

&quot;Now there&#39;s the pot calling the kettle black,&quot; Molly teased. 

&quot;Oh, hush,&quot; the blonde replied, her cheeks turning pink. &quot;Seriously, 
what&#39;s bugging you bad enough to spook you?&quot; 

Molly hesitated, not sure of how much she should reveal to Serena. She 
was still trying to figure out the strange and unexpected reaction she 
had gotten when she had told the blonde about her involvement with 
Nephlyte, but she hadn&#39;t told her everything about him and where he 
came from. 

&quot;Well....&quot; she said slowly, trying to stall for time while she thought 
furiously. A memory surfaced in the chaos in her mind and she smiled. 
&quot;For one, I hear Ami has a boyfriend, one that is considerably older 
than she is.&quot; 

Serena blinked and sat back, trying to conceal the expression on her 
face. &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; she said neutrally. Ami&#39;s been trying to keep her 
relationship with Tolaris out of the spotlight, she thought, but I 
guess the cat&#39;s out of the bag on this one.... 

&quot;It&#39;s just something Melvin said he heard about,&quot; Molly said. 

Serena made a soft grumbling noise in her throat. &quot;That little weasel 
doesn&#39;t have the first clue about relationships, Molly. He&#39;s probably 
got the wires in his brain crossed or something.&quot; 

Molly shrugged. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she said distantly as her mind started to 
withdraw in on itself again. A stray thought popped into her mind and 
she turned to give her friend an odd look. &quot;I thought you and Ami were 
good friends,&quot; she said slowly. 

Serena blinked. &quot;We are.&quot; 

&quot;And you don&#39;t know anything about her boyfriend?&quot; 

Serena blinked again, looking like a deer caught in the headlights. 
&quot;Um, well.... I, uh....&quot; she stammered. 

The corner of Molly&#39;s mouth crooked upwards into a smile. Gotcha, she 
thought. &quot;Out with it, meatball head. What do you know?&quot; 

&quot;Well....&quot; Serena said, her cheeks turning pink again. &quot;Umm.... Ami 
kinda asked me to keep it quiet, given the, ah, unusual nature of 
their relationship and all....&quot; 

Molly laughed, delighted in the knowledge that even a rather 
anti-social bookworm like Ami could find someone attractive, and vice 
versa. &quot;So what&#39;s he like?&quot; she asked, eager to know the details. 

The blonde shook her head. &quot;Sorry, Mol, but I promised Ami I wouldn&#39;t 
start telling everyone about him. And I want you to promise me you 
won&#39;t tell anyone else about him, either,&quot; she said as she gave the 
redhead a mild look. 

She smiled and nodded. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Serena, I promise not to tell 
anyone else. Although I do have to tell you that Melvin was the one 
who told me about Ami having a boyfriend.&quot; 

&quot;Clueless little inchworm,&quot; Serena muttered beneath her breath. 

&quot;Can you at least tell me his name?&quot; Molly pleaded, wanting to know 
something, anything about this latest discovery. 

Serena chewed on the tip of her tongue, weighing her friendship with 
Molly and her desire to gossip against the potential harm the 
information could do. If it were anyone else.... she decided. 
&quot;Alright, but I&#39;ll never forgive you if you tell anyone else.&quot; 

Molly nodded solemnly. &quot;I won&#39;t tell a soul, Serena.&quot; 

&quot;Okay....&quot; Serena said. &quot;His name&#39;s Tolaris Sterling, and he&#39;s.... 
umm, are you alright?&quot; she asked in concern. 

Molly blinked. &quot;What? Oh, I&#39;m fine. I just could of sworn I&#39;ve heard 
that name before. Wasn&#39;t he the one who made the papers last week when 
he happened to stop some guy from mugging an old lady?&quot; 

Serena frowned as she searched her memory. &quot;Not that I know of,&quot; she 
admitted. Besides, she thought, I thought he had been camped out in 
the computer room for most of the past month. 

The redhead shrugged. &quot;Guess not. Still, Tolaris is a rather unusual 
name, don&#39;t you think?&quot; 

Serena smirked. &quot;About as unusual as Serena,&quot; she said. 

Molly giggled. &quot;You have a point,&quot; she said with a smile. Deep inside 
her mind, however, she was far from smiling. I know I&#39;ve heard that 
name before, I just know I have, she thought. C&#39;mon, where did I hear 
it? 

The blonde stood up and stretched. &quot;Listen, I&#39;ve got to head home for 
dinner. Don&#39;t want to be late for that.&quot; 

Molly chuckled. &quot;Now if you could just have the same viewpoint about 
being late to school, you&#39;d be all set.&quot; 

Serena sighed. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault it&#39;s so hard to get up in the 
morning,&quot; she protested. &quot;Especially when it&#39;s for something as boring 
as classes.&quot; 

&quot;Of course, I understand completely,&quot; Molly said soothingly. &quot;Go on, 
I&#39;ll see you at school tomorrow.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Serena muttered darkly. &quot;See you around!&quot; she said 
and walked off. 

Molly chuckled to herself for a few moments. She may be a bit of a 
ditz and more than a little clumsy, she thought to herself, but she 
certainly has a way of cheering people up. 

The moment of humor passed and she felt her mind descending into chaos 
once more. Wait, she thought, I need to try to piece all of this 
together. Tolaris. Now where did I hear that name? Tolaris.... 
Tolaris.... 

Several voices started speaking softly in the depths of her 
subconscious and she sat up suddenly, her eyes widening as various 
puzzle pieces started to fall into place of their own accord.... 

Forgive me for visiting you at this hour, Miss Baker, I am Dragoon 
Commander Tolaris.... Guess what I heard in the rumor mill the other 
day? Ami&#39;s got a boyfriend, and an older one at that.... She&#39;s been 
specially trained in the seven-hundred-year-old Dragoon unarmed 
hand-to-hand combat techniques.... Okay, his name&#39;s Tolaris 
Sterling.... How do you know of the Negaverse? I thought only the 
Sailor Scouts and their allies knew of it.... Commander Tolaris has 
taught you well, considering he never mastered the accent on that 
particular dialect.... 

&quot;No way....&quot; Molly breathed softly as the various snippets of 
conversation blended together to paint a disturbing picture. Wait, let 
me think this one through, she thought. 

Tolaris is the one who brought me Nephlyte&#39;s crystal. Tolaris is also 
the name of Ami&#39;s boyfriend. Coincidence. Ami said she was trained in 
what Mina called the Dragoon unarmed combat techniques. Tolaris said 
he was the commander of the Dragoons. Coincidence again? Tolaris 
taught Sailor Mercury a language and apparently taught her well enough 
to converse with a native. So perhaps Mercury and the other Sailor 
Scouts hired him to help teach them the language. However, he also 
taught Ami martial arts. Both require a great deal of practice and 
attention. 

Molly shook her head gently as something still didn&#39;t quite make 
sense. Okay, she thought, let&#39;s back up for a moment. Mina said 
seven-hundred-year- old Dragoon techniques, which might refer to 
Tolaris&#39;s age rather than the origin of the techniques. If Nephlyte 
could live to be fourteen hundred, which still doesn&#39;t quite sound 
right but anyway, and if both Nephlyte and Tolaris are from the 
Negaverse, then it would make sense, such as it were, if Tolaris could 
be seven hundred years old. I wonder what it&#39;s like to have lived for 
that long? she mused. 

She sighed once more as she got the sensation of the truth dangling 
just beyond her proverbial fingertips. What is it? she screamed in the 
depths of her mind, What am I missing?! 

How do you know of the Negaverse? the voice in her subconscious said. 
I thought only the Sailor Scouts and their allies knew of it.... 

Her green eyes widened as the realization came down on her mind like a 
ton of bricks. How would Ami know about the Negaverse unless she was 
somehow involved with the Sailor Scouts? 

Commander Tolaris has taught you well.... Guess what? Ami&#39;s got a 
boyfriend.... His name&#39;s Tolaris.... She&#39;s been specially trained.... 
Only the Sailor Scouts and their allies knew of it.... Only the Sailor 
Scouts.... 

The extreme shock of the thought overwhelmed her and, for the first 
time since she learned how to talk, Molly cussed softly to herself. 
And had anyone been around to hear her and ask why she did so, the 
explanation she could have given was more than enough to justify it. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;General Rune?&quot; the voice asked softly. 

Rune blinked and looked up from the stack of reports Commander K&#39;tal 
had managed to produce on the Vresh&#39;tan carriers. I definitely need a 
break from all of this technical stuff, she thought darkly to herself 
as her mind focused on the figures standing before her desk. 

&quot;Sergeant, go find a large pot of ma&#39;cha and some cups,&quot; she said to 
the nearest bodyguard. &quot;Any new developments?&quot; she asked when he had 
left. 

Captain Ael&#39;ien nodded. &quot;We&#39;ve discovered something rather interesting 
about how those carriers are communicating. We weren&#39;t able to pick up 
any of the usual ship-to-ship signals after the sensor nets came back 
on-line and we knew that they had to be communicating somehow. Then 
the lieutenant here started to wonder if they were using telepaths to 
relay communications and asked if we could detect them,&quot; she said, 
gesturing to the young communications lieutenant quietly standing 
beside her. 

&quot;Telepaths?&quot; Rune asked incrediously, her gaze alternating between the 
two women. &quot;But I thought the carriers were too far apart to make 
telepathic broadcasts ineffective.&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien made a face. &quot;We thought so too, but a few of the pilots 
flying the Red Wing transports between the carriers are telepathic. 
They didn&#39;t pick up on the psi-energy at first, but after we told them 
about the possiblity, they started actively looking for it. Whatever 
those carriers are doing, it involves a lot of psi-energy, both 
focused and unfocused.&quot; 

Rune&#39;s expression went vaccant for a moment as she thought about the 
unconventional and supposedly impracticable tactic. She looked up as 
her bodyguard returned with a ten-gallon silver canister and a stack 
of ceramic mugs. 

&quot;I asked for pot, Sergeant, not a fuel tank,&quot; she said in faint 
amusement. 

&quot;Begging the General&#39;s pardon, we know what we&#39;re doing,&quot; he replied 
as he set the canister on a conveniently empty desk. &quot;Chief Mal&#39;ek 
sends his regards and says he can have a complete refill available 
with ten minute&#39;s notice.&quot; 

Rune couldn&#39;t quite suppress the smile on her lips. &quot;Is he 
anticipating a sudden desire to overindulge on ma&#39;cha this morning?&quot; 

Her bodyguard gave her an even look. &quot;With all due respect, ma&#39;am, 
we&#39;ve known you long enough to know how you get in a crisis situation. 
The chief was surprised you waited this long to send someone for some 
ma&#39;cha.&quot; 

The dark-haired general merely shook her head in wonder. &quot;Give him my 
compliments next time you see him, Sergeant.&quot; He nodded once and took 
up his duty position, casually fading into semi-invisibility in the 
way that all bodyguards do when trying to remain unobtrusive. 

&quot;So, Captain, I know about your proficienty in psionics and telepathy, 
but what gave you the idea of checking for psi-energy between the 
carriers?&quot; Rune asked as she stood up and walked over to the tank of 
ma&#39;cha. 

Ael&#39;ien coughed lightly. &quot;Actually, General Rune, it was Lieutenant 
D&#39;mer&#39;s idea, not mine.&quot; 

Rune frowned slightly as she sipped at her ma&#39;cha, ignoring the pain 
of the near-scalding temperature of the liquid. &quot;Your idea, 
Lieutenant?&quot; she said in surprise. 

D&#39;mer&#39;s cheeked turned a light shade of azure. &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; she said 
rather softly. 

&quot;So what gave you the idea?&quot; Rune asked. 

&quot;Well, ma&#39;am, when the fixed-site posts reset themselves and 
reacquired their satellite links, we were able to scan the carriers 
for any signals. The thing was, they weren&#39;t picking up anything from 
them. I spent several minutes doing distant-end diagnostics and made 
absolutely sure that there wasn&#39;t some sort of lingering hardware 
problem. The sensor nets were working fine, which meant that the 
carriers weren&#39;t transmitting anything, not even proximity packets.&quot; 

Rune frowned at the unfamiliar terminology. &quot;One moment, Lieutenant, 
I&#39;m not a communications expert. What exactly is a proximity packet?&quot; 
she said as she took a large swallow of ma&#39;cha, making a slight face 
as she burned her tongue on the steaming liquid. 

&quot;When large aircraft travel in close formation, they continually 
transmit a carrier wave with an exponentially degenerating power 
curve. Sensors on the outside hulls pick up the signals and read their 
strengths. If they receive a signal above a certain energy level, it 
means they&#39;re drifting too close to the transmitting aircraft and 
warns the navigator. The whole thing is a safety measure designed to 
prevent collisions,&quot; the young lieutenant explained. 

&quot;And the carriers aren&#39;t using this safety feature?&quot; Rune asked. 

Ael&#39;ien shook her head. &quot;No, they&#39;re not, which is highly unusual. The 
proximity sensors were deisgned well before the Vresh&#39;tan carriers 
were, so we know they have them. And as close as the carriers are 
flying now, it would be not only dangerous but stupid not to use 
them.&quot; 

&quot;And Nop&#39;tera is no where close to being stupid,&quot; Rune said quietly as 
she tried to take a sip of ma&#39;cha. She blinked in surprise, peered 
into the empty mug, and sighed softly to herself. &quot;Continue with your 
explanation,&quot; she said as she refilled her mug. She glanced up in time 
to see her bodyguards quickly removing traces of bemusement from their 
faces. I&#39;ll have to chew out the first one who laughs, she thought 
with a sigh of patient suffering. 

&quot;Well, I knew they had to be communicating somehow,&quot; D&#39;mer continued. 
&quot;If they didn&#39;t, they&#39;d collide the first time someone made a course 
correction to adjust for the wind. I was about to ask one of the drone 
pilots to start searching for some sort of physical connection between 
the carriers, such as mono-filiment wire, when Captain Ael&#39;ien walked 
past my station and her Psi-Corp patch caught my eye.&quot; 

Rune blinked. &quot;And so you thought about telepathy?&quot; 

The azure blush on D&#39;mer&#39;s cheeks deepened a shade. &quot;Not at first,&quot; 
she admitted. &quot;I knew about the effective-range limitation, but after 
trying to detect some other sort of transmission, I decided to bring 
my suggestion to the Captain&#39;s attention.&quot; 

&quot;Which led to the discovery of the carriers&#39; method of communication,&quot; 
Ael&#39;ien said. 

&quot;Excellent,&quot; Rune said as she sipped a fresh mug of ma&#39;cha. &quot;And I 
assume your team is busy intercepting their communications?&quot; 

The telepath blinked and coughed discreetly. &quot;This is where the bad 
news comes in,&quot; she said carefully. &quot;We can listen in, so to speak, on 
any of the unfocused broadcasts, but not on the focused ones. Those 
are a direct mind-to- mind link of some sort.&quot; 

Rune frowned. &quot;So what are they saying on the unfocused broadcasts?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s little more than low-level synaptic static,&quot; Ael&#39;ien explained. 
&quot;In essence, they&#39;re using that to gauge the distance between the 
carriers instead of using the standard proximity sensors.&quot; 

The general sighed quietly to herself and tossed back the rest of the 
ma&#39;cha in her mug. &quot;At least there is some good out of this,&quot; she 
said, giving Lieutenant D&#39;mer an appraising look. &quot;Captain, I want you 
to return to the operations center and continue to monitor the 
situation. If you haven&#39;t done so already, inform Ra&#39;en of your 
discoveries and keep him updated as well.&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien saluted and spun around on her heel, quickly exiting the 
general&#39;s office without seeming to hurry. D&#39;mer was about to return 
to her post when Rune turned her attention towards her, rooting the 
young lieutenant in place. 

&quot;Permission to return to my post, ma&#39;am,&quot; she asked rather softly. 

Rune shook her head. &quot;Stand fast, Lieutenant. You and I need to have a 
little talk. Grab a cup of ma&#39;cha and follow me,&quot; she said as she made 
her way over towards the tiny briefing room. D&#39;mer hesitated for a 
moment until one of Rune&#39;s bodyguards discreetly made a 
hurry-up-and-move gesture. She nodded and went after Rune, pausing 
only long enough to fill a mug with ma&#39;cha. 

&quot;Have a seat,&quot; Rune said as she gestured to a chair and closed the 
door behind D&#39;mer. She noticed the slightly shaky way she sat down and 
a hint of a smile crept across her face. &quot;At ease, Lieutenant, you&#39;re 
not in any sort of trouble or anything. I just wanted to ask you a few 
questions.&quot; 

D&#39;mer nodded as she did her best to appear relaxed while sitting 
straight up in her chair, looking to Rune like someone trying to act 
calm when they were standing before a firing squad. The general took a 
seat across from D&#39;mer and leaned back in her chair, casually sipping 
her ma&#39;cha. 

&quot;Lieutenant, how old are you?&quot; Rune asked gently as she studied the 
way D&#39;mer&#39;s uniform hung on her somewhat wispy body. Can&#39;t be older 
than two hundred, she thought, two-fifty at best. 

&quot;Two hundred and seventeen, ma&#39;am,&quot; D&#39;mer replied as she 
self-consciously ran her fingers through her bright amber hair. 

&quot;And how long have you been in the military?&quot; Rune asked. 

Another azure blush sprang to D&#39;mer&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Close to thirty years, 
ma&#39;am,&quot; she said, a faint note of nervousness making its way into her 
tone. 

Rune blinked and set her mug down on the table, clearly impressed. 
While the regulations stipulated that you had to be at least sixteen 
decades old, the vast majority of society felt that anyone under the 
age of two hundred was too young to be risking their lives in a 
profession as hazardous as the military. 

&quot;Might I inquire why you started at such a young age?&quot; Rune asked. 

The lieutenant blinked and glanced down at her untouched mug of 
ma&#39;cha. &quot;With all due respect, ma&#39;am, that&#39;s not something I would 
like to discuss.&quot; 

Rune blinked in momentary surprise before she nodded. &quot;Very well, 
then, Lieutenant. What exactly prompted you to apply for a 
commission?&quot; 

D&#39;mer&#39;s blush deepened by a shade. &quot;Well, ma&#39;am, to be honest, my 
section chief threatened to physically carry me over to the academy if 
I didn&#39;t apply myself.&quot; 

Rune blinked again. &quot;Your section chief?&quot; she asked in puzzlement. 

D&#39;mer blushed an even darker shade of azure. &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. When I 
signed up with the military, I was an enlisted soldier in an 
engineering detatchment assigned to the Northern Division. I had a bit 
of a knack for electronics, especially communications gear, and she 
felt that I was wasting my talents working as an enlisted soldier out 
in the field. Hence my application to the academy.&quot; 

The general took a sip of her ma&#39;cha, more to stall for time while she 
thought rather than out of thirst. &quot;Why did you select communications 
if your background was engineering?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;It was her suggestion, since she thought I was more comfortable with 
the communications gear than with anything else,&quot; D&#39;mer admitted. 

&quot;And how long have you been an officer?&quot; Rune asked, making a mental 
calculation and suppressing the urge to take another sip of ma&#39;cha. 

&quot;Almost eight years,&quot; D&#39;mer said quietly. 

Rune was suddenly glad she hadn&#39;t taken that sip of ma&#39;cha, else she 
would probably have spewed it out in surprise. &quot;You made full 
lieutenant in only eight years?&quot; she said incrediously, knowing the 
average promotion time from cadet to full lieutenant was on the order 
of fifty or sixty years. When D&#39;mer had told her she had only been in 
for thirty years, she thought that she had gone straight in as an 
officer instead of spending twenty years as an enlisted soldier. 

&quot;I made ensign straight out of the academy,&quot; D&#39;mer explained. &quot;They 
made that decision based on my class standings and my enlisted 
personnel file.&quot; 

The general sat up and punched a button on the tiny console recessed 
into her end of the table. &quot;Have someone get me Lieutenant D&#39;mer&#39;s 
personnel file,&quot; she said into the microphone. There was a faint blip 
of an acknowledgement and Rune closed the circuit. She glanced up and 
saw the color draining out of D&#39;mer&#39;s features. 

&quot;Lieutenant D&#39;mer, I&#39;m going to be honest with you,&quot; Rune said evenly. 
&quot;If you are half as good as I think you are, you&#39;re going to be 
reassigned to a section where your communication skills would be more 
useful to me.&quot; 

&quot;Begging the general&#39;s pardon....&quot; D&#39;mer started to say. 

&quot;Enough, Lieutenant,&quot; Rune said firmly. &quot;Now how long ago did you make 
full lieutenant?&quot; 

&quot;Last year,&quot; she replied, her voice barely audible. 

The door quietly opened and a records clerk stepped in, placing a 
rather sizable black folder by Rune&#39;s elbow and refilling her mug of 
ma&#39;cha from a small pot. She set the pot down in the middle of the 
table and quietly made a hasty retreat, closing the door behind her. 

Rune sighed as she eyed the pot. &quot;You would almost think they want me 
to overload my bladder this morning,&quot; she grumbled before she turned 
her attention to D&#39;mer&#39;s personnel file. 

&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Rune said as she spent ten minutes skimming over the 
contents of the file. &quot;Backgrounds in field electronics and 
communications.... spent a full year in the Outreaches.... several 
commendations for superior performance, including one from a general 
officer.... interesting, Nephlyte didn&#39;t give those out easily to 
enlisted soldiers,&quot; she commented as she read the rather flowery 
citation. 

&quot;Standard combat training.... the usual horde of routine paperwork, 
all oustanding.... now this is odd,&quot; Rune said as she looked up at 
D&#39;mer. &quot;You were awarded the Dragoon Legion of Merit?&quot; 

&quot;It was during a joint training exercise,&quot; D&#39;mer explained, the azure 
hue continuing to deepen on her cheeks. &quot;I was able to decypher most 
of the encrypted traffic on their secure networks, all the way up to 
level 5-Aerce. The result of that was a restructuring of their 
encryption methods.&quot; 

Rune examined the award&#39;s citation and blinked at the signature 
scrawled on the very bottom. Dragoon Commander Tolaris, she thought. 
If he thought her worthy of an award usually only given to Dragoons 
for exceptional reasons.... &quot;You do know this makes you an honorary 
Dragoon, right?&quot; she said slowly. 

&quot;That&#39;s what Commander Tolaris told me when he awarded it to me, but I 
never had any desire to work for Intelligence,&quot; D&#39;mer said. 

Rune nodded absently as she skimmed through the rest of D&#39;mer&#39;s file. 
&quot;I must say, Lieutenant, there are very, very few people with records 
like yours. How do you like your current position in the command 
center?&quot; 

D&#39;mer&#39;s aquamarine eyes blinked. &quot;I like it rather well, ma&#39;am. I know 
how to do my job to everyone&#39;s expectations and it&#39;s something I find 
to be personally rewarding.&quot; 

Rune closed the file and gave D&#39;mer an even look. &quot;How would you like 
to work directly for me?&quot; 

The young lieutenant blinked in surprise. &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; 

&quot;After going through the appropriate training, you&#39;ll be assigned to 
the Red Wings as a field communications expert,&quot; Rune explained. &quot;If 
your unit is deployed, you&#39;ll go with them and take your instructions 
from the team leader, but until then you report directly to me as part 
of my personal communications team.&quot; 

D&#39;mer blinked again. &quot;Red Wings?&quot; she echoed. &quot;But they were disbanded 
three thousand years ago and no longer exist.&quot; 

Rune smiled. &quot;That&#39;s right, Lieutenant D&#39;mer, they don&#39;t exist.&quot; 

&quot;But I thought you just said....&quot; D&#39;mer said before the realization 
began to sink in. 

&quot;You do have the field background needed and your record speaks for 
itself about your potential,&quot; Rune said as she gestured to the black 
folder. &quot;And seeing how four of my best teams are now radioactive air 
pollution, I could use a few more good soldiers.&quot; 

D&#39;mer blinked and looked down at her now lukewarm mug of ma&#39;cha. &quot;If I 
may have a few minutes to think about it....&quot; she said softly. 

&quot;It will be a very difficult challenge for you, D&#39;mer,&quot; Rune said 
softly. &quot;The physical training is the most demanding program we have, 
and while you&#39;re not physically ideal for the task, your other 
qualifications more than make up for the deficiencies,&quot; she explained 
as she glanced over D&#39;mer&#39;s wispy frame. &quot;Besides, a young girl like 
yourself could use a little muscle here and there, if only to attract 
others to your bedside,&quot; she said with amusement. 

D&#39;mer&#39;s skin color almost went completely azure. &quot;And what&#39;s the price 
to be paid for accepting this?&quot; she asked. 

Rune sighed quietly, knowing she would have to be honest about this 
one. &quot;The price, D&#39;mer, is you will appear to die in an accident and 
cease to exist to society. You will be given a new name, one of your 
own choosing, a new face using minor cosmetic surgery, and a new life. 
No friends or family, no ties to society, and no past. You&#39;ll be 
starting over with a clean slate.&quot; 

D&#39;mer paled. &quot;No friends or family...?&quot; 

Rune nodded. &quot;I know that you have no living relatives left, which is 
why I&#39;m offering this job to you. Breaking off friendships is hard 
enough, but no one could expect you to turn your back on your family.&quot; 

D&#39;mer&#39;s hand was trembling slightly as she reached out and picked up 
the mug of ma&#39;cha. She slowly sipped at it as she thought, her gaze 
going vacant. Something clicked in her mind and she quickly refocused 
on the present. &quot;And if something should happen to me, like what 
happened this morning?&quot; 

&quot;The Red Wings don&#39;t exist,&quot; Rune said quietly. &quot;They haven&#39;t existed 
for three thousand years, and they will stay that way. Very, very few 
people even know as much as you know now, Lieutenant, and it is going 
to be kept that way. As far as everyone is concerned, those teams were 
never there this morning.&quot; 

&quot;And so it&#39;ll be the same with me in a situation?&quot; D&#39;mer said bluntly. 

Rune nodded. &quot;Unfortunately. If a team is captured, we&#39;ll do 
everything we can to get you released as long as no one knows. The 
reason I&#39;m telling you this now is because you need to know the truth 
in order for you to make the right decision.&quot; 

D&#39;mer nodded, slightly sickened at the thought. &quot;If you&#39;ll forgive a 
rather mercenary question, General, but what&#39;s in it for me?&quot; 

Despite her best efforts, a smile spread across Rune&#39;s face. &quot;The 
money is rather substantial, even by my standards, and you get access 
to all of the latest technology. Priority access to most resources, 
especially when you&#39;re on an assignment, and very little to worry 
about from us. We give you the tools to do the job and turn you loose. 
What exactly you do, how you do it, when, where, who, that&#39;s all up to 
your team as long as the job gets done. And whatever you decide to 
bring back is yours. The only exception to that is if its information, 
in which case we get a copy. Anything else is yours.&quot; 

D&#39;mer blinked. &quot;So, hypothetically speaking, say I join up, go on a 
mission, and on the way out I happen to see a nice set of frequency 
scanners just lying around....&quot; 

&quot;Then hypothetically speaking, as soon as your mission is officially 
over, you get to spend some quality time playing with your new toy,&quot; 
Rune said. &quot;I take it one of your hobbies is custom electronics?&quot; 

D&#39;mer nodded. &quot;Has been since I was fifty.&quot; 

&quot;Good electronics are hard to find these days,&quot; Rune mused. 
&quot;Especially the higher-powered ones.&quot; 

D&#39;mer&#39;s sigh spoke volumes about the weight suddenly dumped upon her 
soul. She sat back and sipped at her ma&#39;cha, her gaze once again going 
vacant as her thoughts turned themselves inward. &quot;How long will the 
initial training take?&quot; she asked distantly. 

Rune thought for a moment. &quot;It all depends on how fast you can learn. 
It takes about a month for the average new recruit to get through the 
basics. Once that&#39;s over with, you&#39;ll be assigned to a unit and placed 
on back-up status. From there, you&#39;ll learn as you go. Once the unit 
captain feels you&#39;re ready, you&#39;ll be placed on active status and 
deploy as an integrated member of the unit.&quot; 

&quot;How large is a typical unit?&quot; D&#39;mer asked, still thinking hard. 

&quot;It depends on the mission, but twelve is a nice, even number.&quot; 

&quot;And how many women are assigned to these units?&quot; D&#39;mer asked, looking 
up at Rune with an odd look in her aquamarine eyes. 

Rune blinked at the unexpected question. &quot;Very few, I&#39;ve heard.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like a challenge,&quot; D&#39;mer said softly. 

&quot;Indeed it is,&quot; Rune replied. 

Lieutenant D&#39;mer suddenly stood up and straightened her uniform. &quot;So 
when do I leave?&quot; she asked, a gleam appearing in her eyes. 

&quot;When would you like to die?&quot; Rune answered. 

D&#39;mer thought for a moment. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve been trying to build a 
type-4 sensor suite for the headsets found in TacSats for quite some 
time now,&quot; she said slowly. 

Rune blinked. &quot;Oh?&quot; she said, knowing that any unauthorized 
construction of military hardware above type-3 was strictly illegal. 

&quot;It&#39;s a shame that I miswired the power supply and electrocuted 
myself,&quot; D&#39;mer continued with an impish grin. 

Rune nodded. &quot;Nice, neat, won&#39;t attract undue attention, and is 
something plausible. I like your style, Lieutenant. You&#39;ll receive 
full honors, of course, despite your obviously illegal activity. When 
did you do this?&quot; 

D&#39;mer glanced at her watch. &quot;I go off shift in three hours. Give me 
four hours after that to change, get something to eat, and start to 
relax with my favorite hobby.&quot; 

Rune nodded and opened another channel on her tiny communications 
panel. She waited for the secure link to be established before 
speaking into the microphone. &quot;V&#39;Kreeth, I want you to come to my 
office and escort our newly promoted Lieutenant Commander down to 
supply. She&#39;s volunteering to go on the field training exercise in the 
northern mountain range and will need to be issued the appropriate 
gear.&quot; 

There was a soft beep of an acknolwedgement and the circuit was 
closed. Rune looked up in time to catch the surprised look on D&#39;mer&#39;s 
face. &quot;Is there a problem, Commander?&quot; 

&quot;I knew I&#39;d make rank eventually, ma&#39;am, but not this fast,&quot; she said 
with a grin. &quot;Who&#39;d imagine that anyone could make Lieutenant 
Commander in just eight years?&quot; 

Rune shook her head. &quot;Trust me, D&#39;mer, with the price you&#39;re paying, 
the extra weight on your rank patch is just a small compensation.&quot; 

&quot;Understood, General Rune,&quot; D&#39;mer said, snapping into attention. &quot;Just 
one thing, if I may.&quot; 

General Rune looked at her curiously. &quot;Of course.&quot; 

&quot;Call me Azure,&quot; she said with a faint smile. &quot;My mother used to call 
me that when she was teasing me about blushing.&quot; 

The door quietly opened and a shadowy form silently walked in, seeming 
to be no more than a pool of darkness with two dark gray eyes. &quot;You 
sent for me, General?&quot; he said softly, his voice sounding like dry 
leaves whispering over stone. 

Rune stood up and nodded. &quot;V&#39;Kreeth, this is Lieutenant Commander 
Azure, my new communications specialist. She&#39;ll be attending the field 
training camp we have up in the northern mountain range after 
tomorrow.&quot; 

V&#39;Kreeth nodded. &quot;Understood. If you&#39;ll come with me,&quot; he said to 
D&#39;mer and left the room. D&#39;mer only paused long enough to salute Rune 
before she spun around on her heel and followed Rune&#39;s bodyguard out 
the door. 

The door closed and Rune sat back down, opening D&#39;mer&#39;s personnel file 
once more. Something tells me I&#39;m going to need to keep a close eye on 
this one, she thought as she slowly read each entry in the black 
folder. A mental list of preparations unfolded in her mind and she 
reached out to open the communications line to Red Wing command center 
hidden deep within the northern mountain range. 

&quot;Get me Colonel Azi&#39;mar,&quot; she said into the microphone. &quot;I&#39;ve got a 
new soldier for him, one with a high level of potential.&quot; She waited 
until she could hear a soft voice coming from the speaker, then began 
to talk to the open air about what was on her mind. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;Hold it,&quot; Alex said as she leaned against what she dearly hoped was 
an inert rock. &quot;I don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but I need to stop 
and rest for a few minutes. That last one nearly did me in.&quot; 

Susan frowned, her expression adding a sharper cast to her demonic 
form. &quot;Are you injured?&quot; she asked as she absently rubbed the slash on 
her forearm that was the result of their most recent encounter with 
the inhabitants of the neo-void. 

&quot;Physically, no,&quot; Alex said as she stretched her leg muscles. &quot;But to 
be honest, this place is really, really starting to get to me. And I 
don&#39;t mean just in a mental sense,&quot; she added. 

&quot;Now you know what we go through all our lives,&quot; Myst said softly as 
she readjusted her position in Alex&#39;s arms. 

&quot;How badly are you hurt?&quot; Mephisto asked as he tried to get a better 
look at the wound on Susan&#39;s arm. 

Susan&#39;s wings twitched as she gave him an even look. &quot;I assure you it 
is of no consequence. It is merely a minor cut that will be fully 
healed within the hour,&quot; she said. 

Alex sighed to herself at the edge to Susan&#39;s otherwise alluring 
voice. One of these years, she thought, someone is going to explain to 
me how it&#39;s possible to have a voice that can make you desire her and 
fear her at the same time. &quot;And how far do we have to go?&quot; she asked 
warily. 

Mephisto turned around to stare into the darkness that surrounded 
them. &quot;Another ten minutes of walking should put us at the front 
gate,&quot; he said. 

&quot;Great,&quot; she said as she sat down and removed her shoes for a few 
moments. &quot;These shoes are great for ballroom dancing, but they&#39;re at 
the bottom of my list of shoes I like running in.&quot; 

&quot;So what do we plan to do once we reach the gate?&quot; Myst asked as she 
leapt out of Alex&#39;s lap and briefly stretched. 

Susan raised a slender eyebrow. &quot;We knock and ask this Balor to give 
us Michelle&#39;s soul,&quot; she said simply, drawing looks of surprise from 
everyone. 

&quot;Just like that, huh?&quot; Alex said, a faint edge to her voice. She 
blinked and glanced away when Susan&#39;s glowing red eyes fixed her with 
a piercing gaze. 

&quot;Do you have a better suggestion?&quot; Susan said softly. 

&quot;Perhaps it would be better if you explained to us what exactly you 
have in mind,&quot; Mephisto said carefully, privately agreeing with Alex&#39;s 
stated disbelief at the simplicity and audacity of the plan. 

&quot;Very well,&quot; Susan said, turning around to scan the surrounding area 
for any danger. &quot;I am seeking a human soul to try to reanimate as a 
gift for my human.... companion,&quot; she said, placing a strange emphasis 
on the last word. &quot;I have heard that a Shinma named Balor collects 
souls and have asked you, Mephisto, to guide me to his keep.&quot; 

Mephisto blinked and exchanged glances with Alex and Myst. &quot;And what 
of Myst?&quot; he asked. 

&quot;A friend I made during my travel,&quot; Susan said. 

Alex shook her head in wonder as she put her shoes back on. &quot;You know, 
Sue, that story almost sounds like it&#39;ll work.&quot; 

Susan&#39;s wings flexed as she cast a look over her shoulder. &quot;Who said 
it&#39;s not the truth?&quot; she asked archly. 

&quot;Cover story aside, you think he&#39;s going to give you a soul out of the 
kindness of his heart?&quot; Alex wondered as she picked up Myst and stood 
up. 

&quot;Everyone has their price,&quot; Susan said softly. 

&quot;So what are you going to offer him in exchange?&quot; Mephisto asked 
quietly. 

Susan merely turned around and looked at him, one slender eyebrow 
arched up in mild amusement. &quot;Leave that to me,&quot; she said, her voice 
taking on a faint note of anticipation. 

A small flag suddenly went up in Alex&#39;s mind. &quot;Umm, Sue? Don&#39;t tell me 
you&#39;re planning on doing what I think you&#39;re going to do....&quot; she 
said. She saw the corners of Susan&#39;s mouth twitch in amusement and she 
sighed, knowing exactly what she had in mind. 

&quot;Again, do you have a better suggestion?&quot; Susan said lightly. 

&quot;Just promise me one thing,&quot; Alex said wearily. &quot;Don&#39;t make it last 
for more than an hour, and whatever you do, don&#39;t let us hear you 
two.&quot; 

Mephisto frowned as Susan chuckled quietly to herself, wondering what 
he was missing. &quot;If I may ask....&quot; he started to say. 

&quot;You don&#39;t wanna know,&quot; Alex muttered as she started scratching behind 
Myst&#39;s gray ears. &quot;Trust me, you really don&#39;t.&quot; 

Mephisto was inclined to agree with her assessment, but something was 
still bothering him about the whole deal. After a few more moments of 
thought he turned to Susan for an explanation, but the look in her 
glowing red eyes and the smile on her lips told him all he needed to 
know. 

&quot;You&#39;re a succubus, aren&#39;t you?&quot; he asked softly. He heard a sharp 
hiss behind him as Myst accidentally clawed Alex again in her state of 
shock. 

&quot;You&#39;re about this close to getting forcibly declawed,&quot; Alex muttered 
to the Shinma as she tried to calm her down. 

Susan nodded. &quot;In part. My father was an inccubus and my mother was 
human, so my demonic heritage is that of a succubus. However, because 
I am not a pure succubus, what powers I do have is somewhat weakened.&quot; 

&quot;But you do have them nonetheless,&quot; Mephisto said as evenly as he 
could. 

Susan tilted her head to one side as she regarded him curiously. 
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me that you fear a half-breed succubus,&quot; she said mildly. 

&quot;Fear would not have been my first choice to describe it, but yes,&quot; he 
replied. &quot;I&#39;ve heard of your kind and know what they can do.&quot; 

Alex sighed as her gaze alternated between the demon and the Shimna. 
&quot;Why is it I never seem to understand what they&#39;re talking about?&quot; she 
asked Myst. 

The cat bristled momentarily. &quot;Trust me, if you don&#39;t know, then you 
are better off not knowing.&quot; 

&quot;I still don&#39;t get it,&quot; Alex continued. &quot;I mean, I think she&#39;s told me 
everything she can do with her kiss and tried explaining about her 
supposedly not-quite-controllable appetite for pleasure, but what&#39;s 
the problem?&quot; 

&quot;May I?&quot; Mephisto asked. 

Susan raised an eyebrow. &quot;By all means,&quot; she said with faint 
amusement. 

&quot;According to the creation legends, when the Underworld was forged out 
of Chaos, Hades knew he would need a great deal of help to keep 
everything under control, so he tore off a fragment of the AEther and 
began to make his minions. While the demons were created to maintain 
the Underworld, he created specific forms for specific tasks. The fire 
demons for the Lake of Fire, for instance. When he came to the task of 
harvesting the souls of those living in the sin of Lust, he created a 
breed of women whose beauty would entice and whose kiss could send a 
soul to the Underworld. Hence, the succubi,&quot; Mephisto explained. 

Susan nodded. &quot;Your knowledge of the ancient legends is impressive.&quot; 

Alex frowned. &quot;I&#39;ll admit it sounds better than evolving from monkeys, 
but I don&#39;t see where the fear factor comes in.&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps I should explain,&quot; Susan said. &quot;I&#39;ll admit this gave me some 
difficulty at first, but I got used to the idea. In essence, I and the 
other succubi were created for the sole purpose of seducing and 
killing.&quot; 

The blonde blinked as the concept finally sunk into her brain. &quot;Wait a 
sec,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;You mean to tell me you were created to sleep 
around and, once that&#39;s finished, yank your victim&#39;s soul out through 
his nose?&quot; 

&quot;Or her nose, or out of whatever happens to be convenient at the time, 
but that is, for all intents and practical purposes, correct,&quot; Susan 
replied. 

Alex decided to sit down before she fell down, cursing softly beneath 
her breath as she landed harder on her rear than she had intended. 

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Susan said in response to the choice of profanity, 
drawing a not-quite-amused look from the blonde. 

&quot;You know....&quot; Alex said, her voice suddenly sounding very tired, 
&quot;This explains quite a lot about some of the stuff you used to do. And 
just between you and me, I&#39;d rather not have known about this little 
detail of your nature.&quot; 

&quot;You asked,&quot; Susan replied. 

Alex just sighed and shook her head. &quot;Just one question, Sue. You ever 
kill anyone by accident with your kiss?&quot; 

Susan blinked at the unexpected question and thought for a moment. 
&quot;Hmm. I don&#39;t quite remember, to be honest, but if I did, it was when 
I was still a child and learning how to use my powers.&quot; 

&quot;For some reason, I can&#39;t picture you as a child,&quot; Alex said as she 
stood back up and cradled Myst in her arms. 

The succubus laughed softly to herself. &quot;Granted my childhood wasn&#39;t 
the most pleasant of experiences, but it was.... interesting.&quot; 

&quot;May I ask how old you are?&quot; Mephisto asked quietly. 

Susan&#39;s light mood evaporated like fog as she gave him a mild look. 
&quot;No, you may not,&quot; she said evenly. 

&quot;She&#39;s rather touchy about her age,&quot; Alex offered. 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Mephisto replied, returning Susan&#39;s gaze. &quot;Perhaps we can 
have a discussion about your knowledge of divination and astrology at 
a later date?&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Susan replied. 

Alex just sighed. &quot;There they go again, talking about something that 
makes very little sense to us ordinary humans.&quot; 

Mephisto was about to explain when suddenly both he and Susan spun 
around and took up defensive positions against the darkness behind 
them. Startled, Myst leapt out of Alex&#39;s arms and crouched low to the 
ground, her gray fur sticking out in all directions. 

&quot;A little warning would be nice,&quot; Alex hissed as she dropped into a 
combat stance and started glancing around her. 

&quot;Who&#39;s out there?&quot; Susan said sharply, her glowing red eyes narrowed 
as she peered into the shadows. 

&quot;Perhaps that should be my question to you,&quot; replied an inhuman voice. 
&quot;It is not often that I find.... visitors near my keep.&quot; 

&quot;Lord Balor, I assume?&quot; Susan said, flexing her wings slightly. 

A humanoid figure stepped out of the darkness, completely enshrouded 
in a massive black cape and cowl. &quot;Indeed I am,&quot; he replied. The cowl 
shifted position slightly as if his head had moved to look around. 
&quot;And who might you be?&quot; 

&quot;Susan Meiou,&quot; Susan replied with a slight nod of her head. 

&quot;Meiou?&quot; Balor asked, his voice betraying momentary surprise. &quot;That is 
not a clan name I am familiar with,&quot; he said slowly. The cowl shifted 
again and a low rumbling sound emerged from its depths. &quot;I thought you 
prefered not to involve yourself with any of the clans, Mephisto.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed I do not,&quot; Mephisto replied. &quot;I have been asked to serve as a 
guide to your keep, nothing more.&quot; 

&quot;Ever the disinterested observer,&quot; Balor said, his voice laced with 
scorn. &quot;So what brings you here this time, Watcher?&quot; 

&quot;I asked him to bring me here so that you and I could have a 
discussion,&quot; Susan said, flexing her wings slightly. &quot;I understand you 
collect souls for your own purposes.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed I do,&quot; Balor said slowly, his voice rumbling in his chest. 
&quot;And what is your interest in my.... hobby?&quot; 

Susan tilted her head to one side as she regarded the cloaked Shinma 
very carefully. &quot;I am looking for a human soul to give as a.... gift 
for my human companion,&quot; she said as she gestured to Alex. 

The dark cowl shifted towards Alex and the blonde shrank back slightly 
under the sudden scrutiny. &quot;A human?&quot; he said, his voice tinged with 
surprise. &quot;Might I ask how you managed to acquire her?&quot; 

Susan saw the expression on Alex&#39;s face at the thought of being 
considered as property and did her best to ignore it. &quot;You would be 
surprised what you find lying around,&quot; she said lightly. &quot;Much, as I 
would imagine, like the way you find some of your souls.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said as he nodded. &quot;And what of this one?&quot; he asked as he 
gestured to the gray cat on the ground. Myst bristled slightly at the 
sudden attention, trying to relax as Mephisto made a discreet gesture 
for her to do so. 

&quot;An ally I made during my travels,&quot; Susan explained. &quot;We were 
travelling in the same general direction and thought it best to travel 
together for each other&#39;s protection.&quot; 

Balor nodded in understanding. &quot;But obviously it didn&#39;t work out quite 
as well as you had hoped,&quot; he said, gesturing to the still-healing 
slash on her arm. 

Susan smiled. &quot;They had the same idea.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed....&quot; Balor said softly to himself. &quot;So you say you are looking 
for a human soul, and have come here to ask me about it.&quot; 

Susan nodded, her expression turning serious. &quot;I understand that they 
are quite fragile and next to useless as sources of power, but they do 
have a few redeeming qualities.&quot; 

Mephisto silently edged next to Alex and gently placed a restraining 
hand on her wrist, an unspoken gesture for her to remain silent as 
Susan and Balor talked. She sighed quietly and kept her facial 
expression neutral, vowing to have a not-so-polite discussion with 
Susan about the matter. 

Balor laughed quietly. &quot;Are we talking about humans or their souls?&quot; 

Susan raised a delicate eyebrow. &quot;Their souls, of course. Believe me, 
my Lord, humans may not be as strong or as enduring as you or I, but 
what they lack physically is more than made up for in their strength 
of character.&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; he mused as he looked Alex over once more. &quot;But while their 
souls are for the most part devoid of power, I do have an occasional 
use for them,&quot; he said evenly. 

&quot;I am willing to negotiate for one,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;While I don&#39;t 
have a direct use for one, it would keep her.... occupied, and that in 
turn would be most.... beneficial to me,&quot; she explained with a hint of 
a smile in her voice. &quot;And that is worth a meaningful price.&quot; 

&quot;And what sort of payment did you have in mind?&quot; Balor asked. 

&quot;That depends,&quot; Susan said slowly. &quot;If you do indeed have a human soul 
you could bear to part with, I should like to see it first.&quot; 

The dark cowl shifted slightly and tilted to one side, still 
concealing what lay beneath in darkness. He regarded her for a moment 
before something shifted beneath his cloak and emerged from a sleeve. 
&quot;Will this do?&quot; he said as an appendage swathed in darkness held up a 
faintly glowing ball of light. 

Susan reached out to touch it, moving slow enough to ensure he knew 
what she was doing. As her fingers brushed the edges of the intangible 
sphere, she got the fleeting impression of a dormant consciousness 
contained within. 

&quot;Alexis,&quot; she said softly as she held out her other hand, &quot;Come here.&quot; 

Alex had to bite her tongue to keep herself from verbally lashing out 
at Susan, instead hesitantly walking up next to her. Susan reached out 
and took her hand, drawing her closer to the glowing ball. 

&quot;This is what you wanted, correct?&quot; Susan said softly. 

Alex blinked and looked at the soul carefully, studying the color of 
the glow. Well, she thought, at least the color matches the color of 
her sigil. However.... &quot;It looks so.... dim....&quot; she said, trying to 
keep her voice soft and even. 

&quot;The color will improve once you start feeding it the energy strands I 
gave you,&quot; Susan explained, as if talking to a child. &quot;That is, if we 
can reach an agreement on a price,&quot; she said as she looked up at 
Balor. 

&quot;You have yet to tell me what you&#39;re willing to give to me as 
payment,&quot; Balor rumbled. 

Susan smiled and turned to Alex, giving her a gentle kiss on her 
temple. &quot;Go back with Mephisto,&quot; she said gently. &quot;I will catch up 
with you once this matter has been finished.&quot; 

Alex blinked. &quot;But Sue....&quot; 

Susan reached up and stilled her lips with a finger. &quot;Go,&quot; she said. 

Alex cast a nervous glance towards Balor and the soul before gently 
sliding her hand free from Susan&#39;s grasp and moving over next to 
Mephisto, casting a backwards glance at Susan as she went. 

&quot;I find it rather.... odd that one such as you would have another 
female, and a human at that, as a.... companion,&quot; Balor said softly. 

Susan regarded him with open curiosity. &quot;Given the shortness of her 
lifespan, she is little more than a diversion for me. But she does it 
well, I have to admit, and talent such as that is hard to come by.&quot; 

The dark cowl shifted as Balor tilted his head again. &quot;Indeed.... and 
might one inquire about her talents?&quot; 

A small, rather predatory smile crossed Susan&#39;s demonic face for a 
moment. &quot;I&#39;m afraid her talents are out of the question,&quot; she said 
slowly. &quot;Her techniques do leave a bit to be desired, however, but 
that is hardly her fault as she can only work with what she has.&quot; 

A deep rumbling sound emerged from the depths of Balor&#39;s cloak. 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said softly. &quot;And what did you do for a diversion before 
you found her?&quot; 

She gave him an apprasing look. &quot;The same thing. Some hobbies only get 
better with each century, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&quot; 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Balor said again. &quot;Perhaps we should arrange a trade of 
sorts.&quot; 

Susan raised an eyebrow. &quot;You mean my hobby for yours?&quot; 

&quot;Does the idea bother you?&quot; 

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Susan said with a hint of a smile. &quot;Even diversions 
need an occasional diversion.&quot; 

The cloak stirred momentarily as if caught by an unfelt wind. &quot;Well 
then, if we&#39;re trading a hobby for a hobby, I think I can spare a soul 
from my collection,&quot; he said evenly. 

Susan bowed her head slightly. &quot;With your permission, Lord Balor, I 
would like my companion to return to my keep and take the soul with 
her. There is much work to be done on it first, and unforunately 
patience isn&#39;t one of her stronger characteristics.&quot; 

&quot;Impatience is usually not desired in your sort of hobby,&quot; he said as 
the indistinct appendage held out the soul to her. 

&quot;Who says we don&#39;t teach each other certain things?&quot; she said mildly 
as she took the soul from him and motioned to Mephisto. He approached 
and she gently handed him the glowing sphere. &quot;Here, take this and 
return to the keep with Alexis. Lord Balor and I have some more 
matters to.... discuss, and I will return when finished.&quot; 

Mephisto nodded. &quot;Myst will guide you back when you return,&quot; he said 
slowly. Susan frowned slightly as she saw Myst cradled in Mephisto&#39;s 
arms, a strange look in the kitten&#39;s red eyes. &quot;She&#39;ll be waiting for 
you here.&quot; 

&quot;Very well. Take good care of Alexis, Mephisto,&quot; she cautioned. 

Mephisto nodded and whispered something to Myst. The kitten 
immediately started to lose her shape, becoming little more than a 
wispy black mass that could easily be mistaken for a trick of the 
mind. Susan lost track of her almost instantly and was about to say 
something when she felt the lightest of weights settle around her, 
clinging to her evening gown like a second layer of fabric. 

Clever, she thought as she turned around to face Balor. &quot;Shall we go, 
my Lord?&quot; she said respectfully as she extended her hand to him. 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said as something indistinct emerged from the folds of 
his cloak to touch her hand. Space suddenly seemed to twist and bend 
around them for the briefest of moments before it unfolded back to 
normal, leaving nothing but displaced air in their place. 

&quot;Are they gone?&quot; Alex asked as she glanced around. 

&quot;They are,&quot; Mephisto replied as he discreetly edged away from her, 
sensing what was about to occur. 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe the bitch did that!&quot; she growled. 

&quot;Perhaps you should consider the end result of her choice of actions,&quot; 
he suggested, trying to calm her down before she went ballistic and 
knowing it was probably a futile effort. 

&quot;Of all the arrogant, conceited, stuck-up, over-bearing...!&quot; 

He shook his head to himself as Alex&#39;s language started to degenerate 
into somewhat graphic profanity. Hopefully she will calm down once we 
return to the mana pool, he thought to himself as he knelt down and 
started to imprint a marker into the ground so he could find his way 
back to their current spot. 

&quot;....and then she goes off to get laid while leaving my butt stuck in 
the middle of nowhere in Hell&#39;s prison!&quot; she fumed to the general 
area. &quot;Not only that, she takes the damn cat with her so I&#39;ve got no 
one to talk to except some guy who&#39;s a good tailor but forgot to add a 
goddamn zipper so I can let some air into this thing....&quot; 

He finished his task and sat down on the ground, not thinking it wise 
to interrupt the near-continuous monologue. She is quite beautiful, he 
found himself thinking as he studied her, despite her penchant for 
using profanity. 

&quot;....and the worst thing about this whole godforsaken situation,&quot; Alex 
fairly yelled out, &quot;I can&#39;t even find a bush, let alone something 
civilized, and I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM!!&quot; 

Mephisto winced as her voice seemed to resonate across the terrain. I 
sense stealth is no longer an option, he thought to himself as he 
glanced around the neo-void. He glanced at her again and noticed that 
she had calmed down somewhat and was now staring out into the 
darkness, muttering softly to herself. &quot;Alexis....&quot; he started to say. 

She whirled around and fixed him with a piercing gaze. &quot;Call me that 
again and I swear I&#39;ll kick your gonads up into your throat,&quot; she 
growled. 

Mephisto blinked at the outburst. He had never heard the slang term 
before, but he had a pretty good idea of what she meant. &quot;Forgive me, 
Alex, I didn&#39;t realize that you were offended by it,&quot; he said slowly. 

She sighed and sat down on the ground, her fingers running through her 
short blonde hair as she tried to calm down. &quot;Yeah, well, I just never 
really cared for the long version, despite what Mother&#39;s intentions 
were. And no, don&#39;t bother asking what they were &#39;cause I&#39;m not going 
to waste my breath by telling you about them,&quot; she said as he opened 
his mouth. 

&quot;Very well,&quot; he said slowly as he studied the faint soul he still 
carried in his grasp. &quot;We should return to the pool before trying to 
revive her, since it is rather dangerous being out in the open like 
this.&quot; 

Alex knelt down next to him to study the soul. &quot;Are you sure you can 
revive her?&quot; she asked, all traces of her outburst of anger gone. 

He looked up at her for a moment. &quot;Of course. After all, I was able to 
revive you.&quot; 

She blinked as his words registered. &quot;Whoops, guess you&#39;re right,&quot; she 
said as a faint blush appeared on her cheeks. &quot;Well, now that we&#39;ve 
got that established, let&#39;s get going.&quot; 

Mephisto nodded and stood up, holding out the soul to her. &quot;You had 
better hold her, as I might need my hands free to deal with whatever 
we may find after we teleport.&quot; 

&quot;Hold it, I thought you could teleport us directly into the cave,&quot; she 
said with a frown as she carefully took the soul from him. 

He sighed quietly. &quot;I could, but a point-to-point dimensional shift 
can be traced from its point of origin. We&#39;ll have to make several 
shifts to make sure we aren&#39;t being followed before entering the 
cave.&quot; 

&quot;And we won&#39;t know what&#39;ll wind up in our faces until after we 
complete the shift, right?&quot; she said warily. 

&quot;Unfortunately, which is why I need my hands free,&quot; he explained. 

&quot;Lovely,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Alright, tall, dark, and handsome, let&#39;s get 
this party started,&quot; she said as she took hold of his wrist. 

Mephisto said nothing, raising an eyebrow at her choice of words 
before turning his focus inward and wrapping three-dimensional space 
around them in a complex quasi-geometrical shape. There was the 
briefest of visible distortions before space unfolded back into a 
normal shape, leaving only displaced air in its place. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Ami paused in the middle of the cathedral hallway, not entirely sure 
if her hypnotic invisibility was having any effect on the giant 
crystalline spider casually hanging off of the ceiling. One of these 
days, I&#39;m going to have to do a little experimentation with it, she 
thought with a mental sigh. But in the mean time.... what exactly is 
it doing, anyway? 

She blinked and took a step back as Maze stepped out of the computer 
room with a very weary expression on his face. He took a few steps 
forward before he glanced up and jumped at the sight of Dyvach 
clinging to the ceiling as any normal spider would do. 

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he said tiredly as he tried to calm his nerves. 
He sighed quietly to himself as he received a multi-harmonic chime in 
response. &quot;Just don&#39;t scratch the paint, okay?&quot; he said as he rubbed 
his eyes and made his way down the hall towards the bedroom he shared 
with Mina, completely unaware of Ami&#39;s invisible presence a few feet 
away from him. 

Dusting? she thought as she watched the weaver for a moment. She 
blinked as she realized that Dyvach wasn&#39;t so much dusting as eating 
the dirt off of the ceiling. That&#39;s it, I give up.... she sighed as 
she focused her will on remaining undetectable and started to walk 
down the hall. 

She made it to the doorway without Dyvach showing any signs of having 
seen her. Okay, she thought as she peered inside the computer room, 
now comes for the tricky part. She took a slow, deep breath and 
concentrated. You do not notice the door being closed, she thought as 
she eased the door shut as quietly as she could. 

Tolaris failed to notice the door shutting as he sat back in the chair 
and re-read the lines of spidery text on the computer screen for at 
least the tenth time in as many minutes. His complexion was rather 
pale and his eyes were bloodshot, giving them a sickly gray tint that 
made Ami start to worry about his state of health. &quot;Nak&#39;seth,&quot; the 
Dragoon commander said quietly, his voice sounding like gravel. 

&quot;Venta,&quot; the computer replied. 

&quot;Kor&#39;osa mase&#39;l K&#39;tal vu&#39;cha-aan,&quot; the Dragoon said slowly as he 
rubbed at his eyes. 

&quot;A&#39;ren&#39;i mase&#39;l,&quot; the computer said in its flat monotone. 

Ami had to bite her tongue to keep herself from making any noise at 
the shock of hearing the computer talk back to him. When did that 
happen? she wondered as she silently moved to a position slightly 
behind him, trying to read the screen without alerting him to her 
presence. While her hypnotic powers could make someone forget that 
they see her, which effectively makes her invisible, it only worked 
when no one had any reason to suspect she was around and hence be more 
aware. 

&quot;Mase&#39;l a&#39;ren&#39;en, na kor&#39;osa&#39;i,&quot; said the computer as the display 
cleared and lines of spidery denizen text began to scroll up. 

She only read the first three lines before she had to bite her tongue 
again, her steel-blue eyes going wide as the situation started to 
unfold in her mind. Okay, large rift, something comes through, someone 
fires a missile at the.... carrier? She frowned as she tried to find 
another translation for the unfamiliar character that would make more 
sense. An airborne carrier? Anyway, then it fires back with.... a 
mailman? No, that can&#39;t be right.... 

Ami was about to sigh heavily in frustration before she remembered 
that she was invisible and hovering almost right behind Tolaris&#39;s ear. 
Don&#39;t need to give him another heart attack.... she thought before she 
covered her mouth with her hand and silently let her breath out. 
Cha&#39;nak-Vilash&#39;ne, she thought as she translated the odd character. I 
don&#39;t know what cha&#39;nak means, but I thought Maze said that the 
vilash&#39;nea acted as message couriers back before they discovered 
electronic communications.... 

Her train of thought was disrupted as Tolaris suddenly sat back and 
began to stretch, a huge yawn starting to build up in his chest. Ami 
quickly moved back in time to avoid brushing up against him, but 
wasn&#39;t aware of the static charge he had acquired until it too late. 

There was a sharp snap of electricity as the charge jumped the narrow 
gap between Tolaris&#39;s fingertips and the tip of Ami&#39;s nose, quickly 
followed by a brief cry of pain. Tolaris leapt out of his chair and 
whirled around in time to see Ami fade into view only a few inches 
away, both hands pressed to her face and the look of shock still in 
her eyes. 

He sighed as he turned the chair around and sat back down, rubbing the 
tips of his fingers. &quot;As I often tell Maze, sneaking up on someone 
like that is an excellent way of getting yourself killed. Are you 
alright?&quot; 

&quot;I should be,&quot; Ami said quietly as she rubbed her nose with one hand 
and wiped a tear out of her eye with the other. &quot;You&#39;ve accidentally 
zapped me with static electricity before, but not on my nose. Was that 
from spending too much time at the terminal or from not getting any 
sleep?&quot; 

Tolaris grunted. &quot;Probably both. I thought you were supposed to be 
studying with the others.&quot; 

Ami frowned slightly. &quot;That was the plan for today, but that was 
before Leda decided to stay up all night instead of sleeping. Having 
Reish&#39;id decide to pay us a visit didn&#39;t help matters.&quot; 

The Dragoon blinked and looked up. &quot;Reish&#39;id is here on Earth?&quot; 

&quot;Maq&#39;i lent him her Silkworm crystal for a few hours,&quot; she explained. 
&quot;And after unintentionally causing a bit of chaos in the park, he&#39;s 
now at Leda&#39;s apartment.&quot; 

Tolaris&#39;s expression darkened slightly. &quot;Did he run across anyone?&quot; 

&quot;Just one person,&quot; Ami said slowly. &quot;Molly.&quot; 

Tolaris sat back in his chair with a heavy sigh, the information 
putting an even greater strain on his mind and body. &quot;Great....&quot; he 
muttered. He looked up as he felt Ami take his hand in hers. 

&quot;Dear, what&#39;s wrong? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen you look this 
worn-out before,&quot; she said softly. &quot;It has to do with the message from 
K&#39;tal, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; He said nothing and she continued with a heavy 
sigh. &quot;Leda told me that you said for her not to tell me what&#39;s going 
on, and after reading about what happened in this incident report or 
whatever it is....&quot; 

&quot;Nak&#39;seth, kurush mase&#39;la ae s&#39;vaer,&quot; Tolaris said suddenly. 

Ami frowned as the computer chittered briefly before the display went 
blank and the terminal went into a low-power standby mode. &quot;Do I want 
to ask why you just did that?&quot; she said cautiously. 

&quot;It&#39;s not something you and the other Sailor Scouts need to be 
concerned with just yet,&quot; he said, the lack of sleep evident in his 
voice. &quot;You should be more concerned about Molly. She&#39;s been exposed 
to too much information and might be in a position to piece a few 
things together.&quot; 

Ami blinked. &quot;What makes you say that?&quot; she said, immediately wary of 
the sudden change of conversation. 

&quot;Think,&quot; he explained. &quot;First off, she&#39;s been caught in the middle of 
a lot of incidents between the Negaverse and the Sailor Scouts. Then 
there&#39;s her involvement with General Nephlyte, and we still don&#39;t know 
the full extent of that. Then you take into account that she&#39;s a close 
friend of Serena, and while Serena might not intentionally give 
anything away, mistakes can be made. And now that she&#39;s run into a 
denizen like Reish&#39;id....&quot; 

&quot;I think I see your point,&quot; Ami said as a dark shiver passed through 
her. Each incident alone isn&#39;t enough to go on anything, she thought, 
but if you put enough of them together.... &quot;So what do you think we 
should do?&quot; 

Tolaris sighed again as he tried to think. &quot;Keep a close eye on her,&quot; 
he said after a moment&#39;s thought. &quot;Try to learn what she knows. And if 
she does figure out enough, you and the other Sailor Scouts have to 
make a decision on how important it is for your identities to remain a 
secret.&quot; 

Ami&#39;s eyes widened as she straightened up, a look of horror crossing 
her features. &quot;You&#39;re not suggesting we consider....&quot; she trailed off, 
unable to vocalize the rest of the thought. 

The Dragoon sighed yet again, feeling every bit as old as his seven 
hundred-plus years of life. &quot;If you want to take the risk of trusting 
her with your true identities, that&#39;s your decision. But you have to 
consider all of your options, no matter how undesirable they may be.&quot; 

Ami said nothing as she turned around, not able to meet his gaze at 
the thought and not believing that he had even suggested it. She tried 
to think of something else that could be done if the situation called 
for it. A stray thought suddenly popped into her mind and she turned 
around to give him an odd look. &quot;If she does find out, can Whisper 
make her forget she knows?&quot; 

Tolaris blinked at the thought and considered it carefully for a 
moment. &quot;You&#39;ll have to ask her as I don&#39;t have much of an 
understanding on how her psionic powers work, but it does sound like a 
plausable idea,&quot; he said slowly. 

Ami nodded, feeling more than slightly relieved at finding a solution 
she could easily live with. &quot;Good, that&#39;s one problem close to being 
solved. Now about the message....&quot; she said as she gestured to the 
now-blank screen. 

Tolaris gently tugged his hand out of her grasp and rubbed at his eyes 
again. &quot;Ami, please believe me when I say you shouldn&#39;t be concerned 
about it right now,&quot; he said, his weariness evident in his voice. 

&quot;It has you so upset that you haven&#39;t even tried to get any sleep 
since yesterday, and Maze only now went to bed a few minutes ago,&quot; she 
said softly. &quot;How can I not be worried about it if it&#39;s doing this to 
you?&quot; 

The Dragoon just sighed. &quot;If you like sleeping peacefully at night, 
then you really don&#39;t want to know just yet. I thought we already went 
through this once before about you wanting to know about certain 
things.&quot; 

Ami frowned. &quot;Like what?&quot; 

Tolaris gave her a measured look. &quot;Like the cathedral&#39;s reactor.&quot; 

The vampire paled slightly at the mention of the reactor chamber in 
the lowest level of the cathedral. Her curiosity about the cathedral&#39;s 
source of power had led her to question Tolaris about it, ignoring his 
warnings that she really didn&#39;t want to know until he finally gave up 
and told her what kind of reactor it was. Afterwards, it had taken her 
three days to calm down to the point where she could get a decent 
night&#39;s sleep without worrying about what might happen if anything 
ever went wrong. 

&quot;See my point?&quot; he said when some of the color had returned to her 
cheeks. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t need to be reminded of that,&quot; she muttered as she glanced 
away, the images she had tried to hard to forget bubbling up from her 
memory. 

He reached out and drew her to him, giving her a gentle kiss. &quot;It&#39;s 
not as bad as that, but....&quot; he said softly. 

&quot;But?&quot; she prompted. 

&quot;But it could be,&quot; he finished. &quot;However,&quot; he said as he reached out 
and stilled her lips with a finger, &quot;There&#39;s nothing any of us can do 
from here except watch and wait, so there&#39;s no use in needless worry 
unless things start to go downhill.&quot; 

Ami said nothing for a moment, studying the dark circles beneath his 
gray eyes and the worry lines framing his face. &quot;If it&#39;s nothing to 
worry about, why haven&#39;t you gotten any sleep?&quot; she asked. 

Tolaris blinked for a moment before he chuckled softly to himself and 
nuzzled her neck. &quot;Old habit,&quot; he murmurred in her ear. &quot;I always like 
to see the reports as they come in, not a few hours later.&quot; 

She said nothing as she returned his embrace, not doubting in the 
least that he liked to get his information as it came in, but not 
entirely sure that was his only reason for staying up for so long. She 
blinked and pulled away from him to give him a curious look as he 
sighed heavily. &quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;Old age setting in,&quot; he said with a hint of a smile. &quot;Five hundred 
years ago, I could have stayed awake for an entire weekend without 
winding up totally brain-dead. I&#39;ve only been up for two days, and 
already my mind is turning into a cinder.&quot; 

Ami gave him a reproving look. &quot;Go to bed, dear.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Doctor,&quot; he chuckled as he released her and stood up, taking the 
time to stretch as he did so. 

&quot;Funny,&quot; she said as she kissed his cheek. &quot;You need me to go with you 
to make sure you don&#39;t bump into anything?&quot; 

Tolaris gave her an amused look. &quot;That depends. If I leave you alone, 
are you going to do something constructive like study or are you going 
to do something foolish like try to break the encryption lock I just 
put on the data files in the computer?&quot; He couldn&#39;t resist smiling to 
himself as a dark blush spread across her features. 

&quot;I love you too,&quot; she muttered as she took hold of his arm and led him 
out of the computer room. She had opened the door and was about to 
step into the hallway when a thought suddenly occured to her. 
&quot;Wait....&quot; she started to say. 

Tolaris was about to say something when he happened to glance up and 
saw the weaver hanging off of the ceiling. While he knew that weavers 
were very much capable of climbing walls when they put their minds to 
it, he hadn&#39;t thought it possible for them to hang from ceilings and 
wasn&#39;t prepared to see one doing so a few feet away from him. 

Ami yelped as Tolaris&#39;s combative reflexes momentarily took over, 
sending an electrical current along his arm in preparation for hurling 
a lightning bolt. He recovered his wits before he actually did so, but 
since Ami had been holding onto him, the charge briefly passed through 
her hand with a sharp crackle. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; he asked quickly as he dispersed the energy into 
the air around him, briefly giving everything a static charge and 
coming rather close to dislodging Dyvach from the ceiling. 

&quot;What did I ever do to you?&quot; she muttered as she flexed her hand, 
trying to get some sensation back into it. 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; he aplogized before looking up at the slightly upset 
crystalline spider. &quot;And what are you doing up there, aside from 
scaring the navidshi out of us?&quot; 

Dyvach chimed an apology before it released its hold, twisting its 
body to land with a heavy thump on its many legs. It made a 
disoriented chiming noise as it flexed a few joints before giving the 
Dragoon a lengthy explanation of what it had been doing. 

&quot;Do we not feed you enough?&quot; he asked with a sigh. The weaver made a 
rather sour chiming noise as it flushed a rather odd shade of orange, 
adding a complex series of chimes to its original statement. Tolaris 
sighed again as he rubbed the bridge of his nose. &quot;You could have said 
something earlier, you know.&quot; 

Dyvach made a rather strangled chiming noise as its usually 
crystal-clear carapace turned a deep shade of black, chittering away 
at a rapid-fire pace in its native language. Tolaris blinked and 
frowned as he quickly translated the weaver&#39;s chimes into something he 
could understand. 

&quot;Of course you can,&quot; he said when Dyvach finally fell silent, softly 
chittering unkind things to itself. &quot;We&#39;re surrounded by a small 
forest of trees. I don&#39;t think anyone will miss half a dozen or so of 
the large ones. The only thing we&#39;re concerned about is keeping enough 
of the foilage around to conceal the cathedral. As long as that&#39;s 
done, you can eat as much of the landscape as you want.&quot; 

Ami gave Tolaris an odd look as Dyvach chimed happily and made its way 
off towards one of the balcony doors. &quot;Do I want to ask what that was 
about?&quot; she asked cautiously. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Dyvach had apparently asked Mina if it could eat 
one of the trees growing outside. She didn&#39;t like that idea too well 
for some reason and told Dyvach it couldn&#39;t.&quot; 

Ami just shook her head slowly. &quot;Another reason to have a dog instead 
of a giant spider as a pet,&quot; she muttered to herself. &quot;Dogs like wood 
too, but when you throw them a branch, they bring it back to you 
instead of eating it.&quot; 

Tolaris chuckled to himself as they continued to walk down the 
corridor towards the bedroom wing. &quot;Luna would be offended if she 
heard you say that,&quot; he said. 

&quot;When was the last time Luna fetched a stick for you?&quot; Ami replied. 

&quot;When was the last time you asked her to?&quot; the Dragoon countered. 

Ami just sighed. &quot;Perhaps Mother had the right idea.&quot; 

Tolaris raised an eyebrow. &quot;And what idea was that?&quot; 

&quot;Maybe there is something to be said for raising goldfish after 
all....&quot; 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;So where will you go now?&quot; the Shinma said rather languidly as he 
tried to summon the energy to sit up and failed miserably. 

&quot;Back to my keep and back to business,&quot; Susan replied as she stretched 
rather provocatively before rising from the bed and flexing her wings. 
&quot;While I do have time to indulge my hobby here and there, I still have 
duties I must attend to.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said softly, still enjoying the pleasant state of 
exhaustion he was in. &quot;And might that mark on your forehead have 
anything to do with it?&quot; 

Susan frowned for a moment before she held her hand up to her head and 
saw a green glow being reflected off of her skin. Forgot about that, 
she thought darkly to herself. &quot;The sign of my master,&quot; she said 
truthfully. &quot;It has the tendency to appear at odd moments as a.... 
reminder that I shouldn&#39;t spend too much time indulging.&quot; 

He said nothing as he watched her get dressed, still curious as to why 
she had wings. He had asked her earlier about it during their 
lovemaking, but she had brushed his question aside with a soft comment 
and a kiss that had sent shocks down what passed for his spinal cord. 
Even now his body tingled at the memory of the kiss, something that 
didn&#39;t quite sit well with him. 

&quot;Perhaps we can do this again sometime later,&quot; he suggested as she 
tugged the jet-black evening gown back into place and smoothed out the 
wrinkles. 

She gave him a partially-amused look. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she said as she knelt 
down to put her shoes on. As she did so, she could feel the fabric of 
her gown shifting slightly, a subtle reminder that there was more 
there than silken threads. She stood up and smoothed out the wrinkles 
once more, making a near- silent noise in her throat. 

&quot;I trust the payment has been sufficient?&quot; she asked the Shinma. 

&quot;Most sufficient,&quot; Balor said with a smile. 

&quot;Then with your permission, Lord Balor, I must return to my keep,&quot; she 
said with a small bow. 

&quot;Of course,&quot; he said with a nod of his head. &quot;I wish you a safe 
journey and I hope we can see each other again.&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she said with a small smile before she turned around and 
left the small room, heading towards the keep&#39;s front gate. 

Balor said nothing as he watched her go, listening to the fading 
sounds of her footsteps in the corridor and the sound of her closing a 
rather heavy door behind her. 

&quot;I&#39;ll admit that this one has me completely confused,&quot; he said to the 
air around him. &quot;Usually at least something is obvious, but not in 
this case.&quot; 

&lt;You do not need to know what goes on for you to do what I ask&gt; said a 
decidedly inhuman voice. The voice seemed to come from nowhere and 
everywhere at the same time, being both soft as a whisper and as loud 
as a scream. 

Balor frowned slightly. &quot;Granted, but things have often been explained 
to me before, in case I need to intervene and don&#39;t have the time 
to.... consult with you about the matter.&quot; 

&lt;Do not concern yourself with this matter. It will shortly be taken 
out of your domain entirely. Of that you have my absolute assurance&gt; 

A dark shiver ran down Balor&#39;s spine at the unholy voice&#39;s words. &quot;Can 
you at least satisfy my curiosity about why she had wings?&quot; he 
ventured, not sure if he was crossing a line by asking further 
questions. 

&lt;She had wings because she is a half-breed succubus&gt; 

The Shinma suddenly sat up in his bed in shock. &quot;A succubus!&quot; 

&lt;Indeed&gt; said the voice, sounding faintly amused. &lt;That same kiss 
which gave you so much pleasure could have torn your soul from your 
flesh had she so choosen. But then again, few pleasures compare to the 
pleasure of making love to a succubus. I trust it was sufficient 
compensation for the loss of the soul you were directed to give her?&gt; 

&quot;I...Indeed,&quot; Balor replied, knowing that his mysterious &#39;guest&#39; had 
been generous in giving him any compensation at all. 

&lt;That is good. If I need your services again, I will contact you&gt; the 
unholy voice said and fell silent. As it did so, the air in the 
chamber seemed to become ever so slightly lighter, as if an intangible 
weight was being lifted from the room. 

Balor sighed and laid back against his pillows. Strange, he thought to 
himself. Usually his assignments were more involved than simply giving 
one particular soul to a wandering succubus and having his reward be 
having part of his life-force extracted out through his nether region 
in a most enjoyable fashion. He shuddered when he thought of what else 
could have been extracted from him at her whim. 

The price to be paid for having a Demon as an ally, Balor thought as 
he laid back down and started to do some serious thinking about the 
situation. So what does a succubus, a human, two Shinma, and a soul 
have in common? he thought. Curious indeed.... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Ami sighed quietly to herself as she looked up at the various displays 
the central computer&#39;s crystal monitor was currently showing. Two 
screens were occupied with the cathedral&#39;s external sensor array, one 
doing a diagnostic and the other searching for something that would 
only last for a few moments when it happened. The third screen 
displayed the current configuration for the voice-interface program, 
and the fourth was a blank screen with a flashing red spider-like 
character in the very center. 

&quot;Computer,&quot; Ami said slowly. 

&quot;Ready,&quot; the flat monotone of the computer replied. 

&quot;Request super-user access, authorization Mercury alpha two five 
four,&quot; she said carefully. 

The crystal computer chittered to itself for a moment before making a 
soft buzzing noise. &quot;State authority for alpha clearance,&quot; it replied. 

Let&#39;s hope this works, she thought to herself as she took a deep 
breath. &quot;Preparation for impending invasion via Silkworm-class 
wormholes. Request access to be granted upon detection of wormhole 
formation at the following location,&quot; she said, rattling off a string 
of letters and numbers that would correspond with a partiular spot on 
the denizen maps of downtown Tokyo. 

The computer chittered to itself as it processed the information, the 
hyper-fast CPU attempting to validate her request against a list of 
accepted and denied factors in it&#39;s access database. 

Ami glanced down at the tiny clock displayed on the bottom of the 
computer screen and prayed she had gotten the timing right. Too soon 
and it won&#39;t start looking until after it happens, and if it takes too 
long, it&#39;ll abort the request and set off an alarm, she thought. Let&#39;s 
hope he&#39;s as punctual as I think he would be.... 

&quot;Access granted upon detection of Silkworm-class wormhole formation at 
specified coordinates. Request window is ten minutes, mark,&quot; the 
computer finally replied in its synthetic monotone. 

One down, one to go, she thought as she glanced up at the display of 
what the external sensors were picking up. She had modified the sensor 
array&#39;s search pattern to look for the wormholes, but she couldn&#39;t 
tell if the array&#39;s range was large enough to pick up the signal. 

As if on cue, one of the readings began to spike as it picked up the 
tiny burst of quasi-dimensional radiation associated with a wormhole 
being opened up between Earth and the Negaverse. Thank you, Reish&#39;id, 
Ami thought as her head whipped around to stare at the fourth display 
screen. 

&quot;Wormhole formation detected at coordinates N3149W2210A0329. 
Alpha-level super-user access granted,&quot; the computer said. 

Ami smiled to herself. You just have to love technology, she thought. 
&quot;Computer, modify access priveledges to include theta-level super-user 
access for the following accounts: Mercury, Senshi, Remote. Lock and 
verify.&quot; 

The computer chittered to itself for several seconds as it made 
changes to its security access roster and bleeped quietly. 
&quot;Theta-level super-user access granted to users Mercury, Senshi, and 
Remote,&quot; it replied. 

&quot;Gotcha,&quot; she whispered to herself, still smiling. The secret of 
gaining alpha-level access had eluded her for weeks until she realized 
that it existed as a means of ensuring orders given under certain 
conditions are executed without waiting to see if the person is 
cleared or not. The drawback was that the &#39;certain conditions&#39; usually 
required a discernable state of emergency for it to be implemented. 

Fortunately for me, Ami thought as she sat back for a moment, the 
system&#39;s decision tree was designed by the military, which makes it 
rather easy to fool it into thinking that a forming wormhole is a 
prelude to an invasion. And since I had advanced warning of Reish&#39;id&#39;s 
wormhole, it made even more sense to the computer that knowing a 
wormhole is going to open up at a particular spot means we know about 
the &#39;invasion&#39; and need to prepare for it. 

And now that I&#39;ve secured super-user access for myself and the 
computer links, it&#39;s time to cover my tracks, she thought as she 
leaned forward, a faint echo of the smile still evident on her face. 
&quot;Computer, terminate super-user session.&quot; 

&quot;Alpha-level super-user access withdrawn,&quot; the computer replied after 
a momentary pause. 

&quot;Request super-user access, authorization Mercury theta seven two 
one.&quot; 

The crystal computer chittered to itself as it checked the access 
roster and bleeped softly. &quot;Theta-level super-user access granted.&quot; 

Too easy, Ami thought with a chuckle. While alpha access was used for 
emergency situations, theta access was supposed to be an internal 
level of access, used only by programs within the computer to gain 
access to certain types of data. The reason she had spent weeks trying 
to gain theta-level access, despite it&#39;s limitations, was because the 
system didn&#39;t keep track of commands given under theta authority since 
they were theoretically supposed to be issued by a user with a logged 
access level. 

&quot;Computer, purge all records and trace logs of all alpha-level 
activity within the past fifteen minutes by user Mercury,&quot; she said 
slowly. 

&quot;Working,&quot; the computer replied as it started to search through the 
data logs for the specified information, erasing the information where 
appropriate. &quot;Purge completed,&quot; it reported a few seconds later. 

Now that we&#39;ve covered our butt, she thought, it&#39;s time to get to 
work. &quot;Computer, access and display technical schematics for external 
matrix port zero nine,&quot; she said evenly as she pulled her computer and 
personal set of micro-screwdrivers out of her Lunar Space pocket. A 
new window opened up on the crystal screen and displayed the 
information she requested as she selected a &#39;driver and began to 
remove the tiny screws on the bottom of her computer. 

&quot;Playing with the computers again?&quot; said a soft voice from the door, 
briefly sending an icy wave of surprise through Ami&#39;s blood. 

&quot;Serena, don&#39;t sneak up on me like that,&quot; Ami chided her as she 
glanced out of the corner of her eye. 

The blonde shook her head as she stepped into the computer room, still 
wearing her school uniform. &quot;I swear, if you don&#39;t have your nose 
buried in some book, you&#39;re either got your computer spread out across 
half a room or you&#39;re poking around on the cathedral mainframe. Or 
occasionally both,&quot; she added as she glanced at Ami&#39;s set of tools and 
the screwdriver in her hand. 

&quot;Oh, please,&quot; Ami said as she briefly rolled her eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t spend 
nearly as much time working with my computer as you think I do.&quot; 

&quot;Or as much as you&#39;d like to,&quot; Serena countered with a smile. &quot;And do 
you have a good reason for your decision to start talking to it, or 
has your brain finally cracked from information overload?&quot; 

Ami turned her head to give her a sweet smile. &quot;Nak&#39;seth, kurush 
a&#39;vel, men&#39;kata Mercury n&#39;thenan s&#39;ech vuun ann,&quot; she said evenly. 

Serena&#39;s eyes doubled in size as the door slammed shut behind her and 
a reinforced bulkhead began to descend from the ceiling. Protective 
shutters started to move into place over the windows, and by the time 
the blonde was able to figure out what was going on, everything was 
locked into place with an ominous thumping sound. 

&quot;A&#39;vel kurush&#39;en,&quot; the computer replied. 

&quot;As you can see,&quot; Ami explained, still smiling, &quot;The cathedral&#39;s 
central computer can somehow understand spoken words now. You have to 
know what you&#39;re doing for it to work, but figuring out what to say 
and how isn&#39;t all that difficult.&quot; 

&quot;I see....&quot; Serena said slowly as she gave the security bulkhead 
behind her a measured look. &quot;Should I ask how strong this steel 
whatever is?&quot; she asked as she tapped it with a fingernail. 

&quot;It&#39;s nothing compared to door on the arsenal vault,&quot; Ami admitted 
with a shrug as she turned most of her attention back to disassembling 
her computer. &quot;However, it is more than sufficient to keep most people 
out of the computer room in case of an emergency.&quot; 

Serena frowned lightly as she turned back around to face Ami. &quot;Or when 
you don&#39;t want to be disturbed when playing with it?&quot; she asked 
pointedly. 

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Ami replied. &quot;The room is only supposed to be 
isolated when something is seriously wrong, like we&#39;re being invaded. 
I just did it as an example of what can be done without having to type 
in each instruction by hand. Nak&#39;seth, i&#39;kurush a&#39;vel, tae men&#39;kata ti 
p&#39;rien,&quot; she added. 

The blonde just shook her head slowly as the bulkhead and protective 
plates started to move back into their usual unsecured positions. 
&quot;You&#39;re starting to sound like a denizen with the ease at which you 
say things like that. I can&#39;t say six syllables without having to 
clear my throat at least twice, and even then I can barely manage to 
get my tongue to say them the way you or Tolaris can,&quot; she complained 
with a faintly sour look. 

Ami just shrugged. &quot;Practice makes perfect,&quot; she said as she removed 
the last screw and carefully pried apart the outer casing of her 
computer. 

&quot;Umm, Ami, before you take that thing apart....&quot; Serena started to 
say. 

&quot;Too late,&quot; Ami said with a wry grin as she held up the two halves of 
her computer, still connected by the multitude of tiny wires inside. 
&quot;It&#39;s only the casing, so I can put it back together if you need it. 
What&#39;s up?&quot; 

&quot;Well....&quot; Serena said slowly as she moved a vacant chair over next to 
Ami and sat down. &quot;I could have sworn I felt one of those dark chills 
while I was still at school, but I had a teacher watching me so I 
couldn&#39;t try to reach any of you on the communicator. Did something 
happen or anything?&quot; 

Ami sighed quietly as she set her computer and screwdriver down on the 
table. &quot;I&#39;m.... glad you brought that up,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Reish&#39;id 
decided to pay Leda a visit and had trouble finding her, so he did 
something to get our attention.&quot; 

&quot;I think it worked, too,&quot; Serena muttered to herself as she shivered 
at the memory of the chill that had gone through her when it happened. 
A stray thought crossed her mind and she looked up with a faintly 
suspicious look in her blue eyes. &quot;What else happened?&quot; 

&quot;Well....&quot; Ami started to say, then hesitated for a brief moment. 

Serena blinked. &quot;You didn&#39;t blast him or anything, did you?&quot; she asked 
in concern. 

A faint smile played on the edges of the vampire&#39;s lips. &quot;No, nothing 
like that, Serena. It&#39;s just that.... well.... he....&quot; 

A dark chill swept through Serena as Ami hesitated again. This can&#39;t 
be anything good if she doesn&#39;t want to talk about it, she thought as 
she started to worry. &quot;Spit it out, Ami. What happened?&quot; 

Ami took a deep breath and tried to calm down. &quot;He sort of ran into 
Molly before we got there.... relax, Serena, he didn&#39;t hurt her or 
anything,&quot; she said quickly as Serena&#39;s eyes nearly doubled in 
diameter, &quot;It&#39;s just that we have a reason to suspect that after her 
contact with Reish&#39;id, she might be able to discern our identities as 
Sailor Scouts.&quot; 

Serena blinked as she digested the information. &quot;That&#39;s not good....&quot; 
she said quietly. She looked up into Ami&#39;s medium-blue eyes and sighed 
quietly. &quot;She knows a few things already, like the fact that you&#39;ve 
got a boyfriend who appears to be significantly older than you are.&quot; 

Ami blinked in surprise before she sighed heavily. &quot;And how did she 
find this out?&quot; she said wearily as she slumped back in her chair. 

&quot;Melvin told her, which means....&quot; 

&quot;....that the entire school will know by sundown tomorrow,&quot; Ami 
finished for her. &quot;Great, just what I need. You didn&#39;t tell her 
anything about us, did you?&quot; 

Serena turned a light shade of pink. &quot;Well.... um, now that you happen 
to have mentioned that, she did ask me for his name....&quot; Her breath 
was cut off in her throat as Ami suddenly leaned forward and grabbed 
the top of her blouse in an iron grip, a look of panic in her eyes. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t tell her, did you?&quot; she said, her eyes as wide as saucers. 

An icy droplet of sweat crawled down Serena&#39;s back. &quot;Umm.... well, 
I.... I sort of told her, but I told her not to tell anyone else....&quot; 

Ami released her grip and slumped back in her chair again, her gaze 
going vacant. &quot;Oh no....&quot; she whispered. &quot;Serena, do you know what 
you&#39;ve done?&quot; 

Serena blinked. &quot;I know you told me not to tell anyone about you 
having a boyfriend, Ami, but she already knew that, and besides....&quot; 

&quot;Serena,&quot; Ami said quietly. She waited until the silence started to 
rub on the blonde&#39;s nerves before she spoke again. &quot;She knows that a 
Dragoon named Tolaris is from the Negaverse.&quot; 

&quot;What?!&quot; Serena said incrediously. 

&quot;Remember when we came back from the Negaverse and had the Star 
Crystal with us?&quot; the vampire said softly. &quot;He gave it to Molly that 
night, telling her who he was and why he was giving it to her. Are you 
going to be okay?&quot; she asked when she saw how pale Serena had become 
within the past few seconds. 

&quot;Oh, god.... Ami, I-I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know....&quot; 

Ami sighed softly as she picked up her computer and snapped the casing 
back together. &quot;Where was she when you ran into her?&quot; she asked as she 
began to replace the tiny screws. 

&quot;Umm, she was in the park, but that was half an hour ago and I think 
she would have gone home for dinner by now,&quot; Serena said. 

&quot;We&#39;re just going to have to find out,&quot; Ami replied as she broke a 
speed record for screwing her computer shut. &quot;Computer, terminate all 
sessions by user Mercury.&quot; 

The crystal computer chittered to itself for a brief moment as it 
closed all of the display windows and reset the screen to show a 
single blinking spider-like character. &quot;All sessions terminated,&quot; the 
computer replied in its flat monotone. 

Serena blinked as Ami stood up and grabbed her arm, dragging her out 
of the room and down the hallway. &quot;Wait a moment, Ami, where are we 
going?&quot; 

&quot;Come on, Serena, we&#39;ve got to go talk to her and now,&quot; Ami replied, 
still tugging on the blonde&#39;s arm. &quot;You&#39;re her friend and we&#39;ve got to 
get her to tell us what she knows.&quot; 

&quot;Alright, already, don&#39;t get your panties in a wad,&quot; Serena grumbled 
as she yanked her arm free of Ami&#39;s grasp and followed her down the 
hallway. &quot;But how do we do that without letting her know we know 
something? We can&#39;t just walk up to her and ask, &#39;Hey, Molly, what do 
you know about the true identities of the Sailor Scouts?&#39;&quot; 

Ami blinked and suddenly came to a halt in mid-stride, causing Serena 
to almost run her over. &quot;Why not?&quot; she asked softly, giving her a mild 
look. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;General Rune?&quot; the voice said softly as it intruded into a rare 
pleasant dream, dispersing the images like fog touched by the morning 
sun. 

What now? Rune thought darkly as she groaned quietly and rolled over, 
trying valiantly to open eyelids that seemed to weigh several pounds 
each. &quot;What sort of crisis do we have now, Si&#39;ren?&quot; Rune grumbled as 
she recognized the silvery insignia affixed to the admiral&#39;s dark-blue 
nightgown. Do I want to wonder why she wears rank on her bed clothes? 
she thought fuzzily. 

&quot;Several, actually,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied, her own voice sounding like she 
had woken up only a few moments earlier. &quot;Which do you want to hear 
about first, the carriers, the Leviathans, or your communications 
lieutenant?&quot; 

Rune said a rude word as she sat up and fumbled for the light switch, 
cursing softly again as the sudden brightness gave her an instant 
headache. &quot;V&#39;Kreeth,&quot; she said, &quot;Go find me some....&quot; 

She blinked as a patch of darkness emerged from her private bathroom 
and she felt a small, sealed packet being pressed into her 
still-outstretched hand, followed by the sound of a glass being set 
down on her nightstand. 

&quot;...thing for a headache,&quot; Rune finished softly. She looked up at her 
shadowy bodyguard and shook her head back and forth. &quot;Tell me, 
V&#39;Kreeth, are you telepathic or was that one just hideously obvious?&quot; 

&quot;It was expected,&quot; he replied evenly. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rune said as she tore open the packet and emptied the 
bluish powder into the glass of water. &quot;You said something about my 
communications lieutenant?&quot; she said, glancing up at Si&#39;ren. 

Si&#39;ren sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. &quot;Yes, Lieutenant 
D&#39;mer. An alarm was triggered in her quarters about ten minutes ago, 
and when security arrived, they discovered that she had apparently 
been working on some sort of sensor suite for TacSat helmets and had 
accidentally electrocuted herself rather thoroughly.&quot; 

Rune didn&#39;t wait for the powder to finish dissolving compelely before 
she drained the entire glass in one large gulp, making a face at the 
bittersweet aftertaste. &quot;Yeech. I want a full report on the incident 
as soon as possible. Who did you leave in charge?&quot; 

&quot;Security Lieutenant Tempest. She said she had seen this kind of thing 
before and said she would take care of the incident,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied. 

Rune nodded, knowing full well that Tempest was one of her better 
agents and had been briefed beforehand on what to expect. &quot;Very well, 
then. Who&#39;s her replacement?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve got one of my officers filling the slot until we can select one. 
I&#39;ll admit he&#39;s not the best of operators, but he will suffice until 
one with better skills can be found,&quot; the admiral said. 

Rune grunted softly, still waiting for the medicine to produce an 
effect. &quot;So tell me about the crisis involving your Leviathans.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ve managed to get a positive fix on the sonar contacts in both 
oceans. Six ships in the south, five in the north, all subsurface 
ships,&quot; she said as she sat on the far end of Rune&#39;s bed. &quot;We still 
don&#39;t have a clue as to where they came from or who&#39;s got control of 
them, but what they seem to be doing is scouting the oceans.&quot; 

Rune blinked. &quot;Scouting?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren sighed and ran her fingers through her short white hair. &quot;What 
they&#39;re doing is using a new type of sonar to determine the number, 
type, and location of the surface ships. And since it&#39;s a brand-new 
type of sonar, the ships didn&#39;t realize they were being pinged until 
it was far too late to do anything about it.&quot; 

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Rune grumped. &quot;So we know that they&#39;re there, but not who 
they are or how they got there, and they know what we&#39;ve got and 
where. Have they discovered the Leviathans yet?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren shook her head. &quot;We don&#39;t think they have, or if they do know, 
they aren&#39;t giving any indications of it. I sent a message to the 
Leviathan captains telling them to follow the ships, but to be 
extremely careful about doing it.&quot; 

&quot;Better and better,&quot; the dark-haired general said sourly. &quot;Do you have 
any good news for me, Si&#39;ren?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren laughed quietly, a rather delicate sound that seemed 
out-of-place given the current situation and mood. &quot;Of course not, 
General Rune. No good news has ever arrived at this hour of the 
morning. But now that you seem to be awake, I&#39;ll tell you why I 
decided to wake you up in the first place.&quot; 

&quot;What did the carriers do now?&quot; Rune asked evenly. 

&quot;Well, this is going to sound strange....&quot; Si&#39;ren began. 

&quot;On second thought, let me use the bathroom first,&quot; Rune suggested as 
she threw aside the covers and made her way into the bathroom, 
muttering dark things to herself about rude surprises and full 
bladders. 

&quot;Probably a wise course of action,&quot; Si&#39;ren said to V&#39;Kreeth when the 
door closed somewhat forcefully. 

&quot;Queen Beryl often did the same thing, if you recall,&quot; replied the 
shadow, his voice sounding to Si&#39;ren like dry leaves whispering over 
stone. &quot;And she was almost always glad she did beforehand.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren smiled. &quot;Tell me something, V&#39;Kreeth. A personal question.&quot; She 
received silence in response and continued. &quot;How are things between 
you and Moirah?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t understand what you mean,&quot; he rumbled softly. 

&quot;I know you two are discreet around Rune and never do anything while 
either one of you are on-duty,&quot; Si&#39;ren said slowly, &quot;But things have 
been.... shall we say, noticed happening between you two.&quot; 

Again she received silence in response and she sighed. &quot;Very well, 
then, but I would like you to consider something. I know very well 
about the rules and regulations about two officers having a 
relationship within the ranks, and quite frankly, I agree with the 
wisdom behind them. However, few people have noticed that they only 
apply within the same branch of service.&quot; 

&quot;So what exactly is to be considered?&quot; V&#39;Kreeth said after a moment. 

Si&#39;ren tilted her head to one side. &quot;I always thought the ability to 
transform one&#39;s body into a cohesive liquid would be highly useful 
within the Navy, especially in the security division. We do have 
bodyguards as well, you know, not to mention a hideously large network 
of plumbing that water can go through as it moves from point to point, 
unnoticed by everyone else.&quot; 

The shadow said nothing, merely moving to one side as the bathroom 
door opened and Rune walked out, only looking slightly more awake then 
when she went in. &quot;If anything is going wind up killing me, it&#39;ll 
probably be from my bladder exploding from drinking too much ma&#39;cha,&quot; 
Rune grumbled. 

Si&#39;ren&#39;s eyebrows rose up in feigned surprise. &quot;I heard Chief Mal&#39;ek 
say something about sending up an old fuel tank filled with ma&#39;cha for 
you earlier today. I thought he was joking, but perhaps he hadn&#39;t 
been....&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s not get into that one, Si&#39;ren,&quot; Rune grumbled as her insides 
twinged at the memory. &quot;Now then, you were going to explain to me 
about the problem with the carriers.&quot; 

&quot;Two of them disappeared,&quot; the admiral said simply. 

Rune blinked. &quot;Disappeared,&quot; she repeated slowly. 

&quot;One moment we had them on our sensors, the next they simply vanished. 
The pilots we had &#39;escorting&#39; them say the carriers seemed to ripple 
like a reflection in a puddle of water before fading from both their 
sensors and visual sight,&quot; Si&#39;ren explained. 

&quot;V&#39;Kreeth, call down to Chief Mal&#39;ek&#39;s office and see if you can&#39;t 
have someone find a bottle of something with a serious kick to it and 
have it brought up here,&quot; Rune said wearily as she sat down on her 
bed. &quot;So what&#39;s K&#39;tal say about this one?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren paused for a brief moment. &quot;I sent someone to go find him and 
have him report to you as soon as he had reviewed what little 
information we have and put something together on it. And knowing our 
little Dragoon, he should be here within the next five m....&quot; 

Everyone blinked as there was a polite but firm knock on the door. &quot;If 
we weren&#39;t in the middle of a crisis, I could be highly amused at 
this,&quot; Rune said as she waved V&#39;Kreeth back and opened the door 
herself. 

&quot;Ma&#39;am, Dragoon Commander K&#39;tal reporting as ordered,&quot; he said 
crisply, despite the fact that he looked like he hadn&#39;t slept in a 
week. His uniform was still in order, but his eyes were so bloodshot 
as to almost appear to be a featureless black. 

&quot;You can come in only if you&#39;ve got good news for me,&quot; Rune muttered 
as she stepped back and waved the Dragoon into her quarters. 

K&#39;tal seemed to hesitate for a brief moment before he stepped in and 
moved to one side, not wanting to intrude any more than necessary. 
&quot;I&#39;ve seen the data we have on the carriers&#39; disappearance and the 
best we can come up with is some sort of electromagnetic cloaking 
device. Don&#39;t ask me for specifics because this is something new to us 
and we&#39;re still trying to figure out how they managed to pull it off,&quot; 
he explained almost breathlessly. 

Rune and Si&#39;ren exchanged concerned glances and Rune sighed. 
&quot;V&#39;Kreeth,&quot; she started to say. 

&quot;Another few minutes,&quot; her bodyguard replied almost apologetically. 

&quot;What about the telepathic communication between the carriers?&quot; Si&#39;ren 
asked, ignoring the sudden icy chill making its way down her spine. 

&quot;The telepathic pilots said it continued for a few moments after the 
carriers cloaked, if you will, but it began to decrease in intenisty 
within a matter of seconds,&quot; K&#39;tal said as he glanced down at the 
condensed report he carried. &quot;Captain Ael&#39;ien is currently occupied 
trying to direct an effort to locate the cloaked carriers using 
telepathic means, but it&#39;s her opinion that the fading signals meant 
that the carriers probably altered their course and could be anywhere 
by now.&quot; 

Rune suppressed the urge to scream. &quot;And what about the third carrier, 
the visible one?&quot; she said, trying to keep her temper in check. 

&quot;It&#39;s maintaining it&#39;s previous course, speed, and altitude,&quot; K&#39;tal 
replied after quickly re-reading the report. &quot;Bearing two-eight-zero, 
speed fifty miles per hour, and an altitude of two thousand feet.&quot; 

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound overly fast,&quot; Rune commented. &quot;I know transports 
that move faster than that.&quot; 

&quot;But that is a rather significant speed for a carrier,&quot; Si&#39;ren 
replied. &quot;Especially an airborne one. You have to consider they not 
only need the power for forward velocity, they also need a great deal 
more just to remain aloft. And given the fact that it&#39;s about the size 
of a small landing strip, that&#39;s quite a lot of mass to be moving 
around at that height and speed.&quot; 

Rune frowned. &quot;And how do they do it, with jet thrusters?&quot; 

K&#39;tal closed his eyes as he briefly searched his memory. 
&quot;Actually....&quot; he said slowly, &quot;The Vresh&#39;tan carriers use a series of 
rotary propellers.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren&#39;s eyes nearly fell out of her head. &quot;What?! They&#39;re keeping a 
carrier aloft with propellers? That&#39;s insane!&quot; 

&quot;Begging the admiral&#39;s pardon,&quot; K&#39;tal said evenly, &quot;If it&#39;s insane and 
it works like it&#39;s supposed to, then perhaps insanity needs to be 
redefined.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren&#39;s reply remained unspoken as there was a soft knock on the open 
door and what could only be described as a wizened old man poked his 
head in. &quot;&#39;Tis a rough night indeed if&#39;n y&#39;r still askin&#39; for th&#39; 
bottle at this hour, General Rune,&quot; he said lightly as he held out a 
small bottle and a rack of glass tumblers. 

Rune&#39;s eyebrows rose up. &quot;Chief Mal&#39;ek, what are you doing up at this 
hour?&quot; she said as she took the bottle from him and examined the 
label. 

Mal&#39;ek chuckled softly to himself, his breath rattling in his lungs. 
&quot;Aye, I be wond&#39;ring that m&#39;self, if&#39;n I dinna happen t&#39; catch word o&#39; 
a bit o&#39; a crisis a&#39;brewin,&quot; he said, his voice marred by both his 
accent and age. &quot;I know how ye be, Rune. All too well, perhaps,&quot; he 
added as he thrust the rack of tumblers into K&#39;tal&#39;s hands, causing 
the Dragoon to make a quick scramble to keep both the report and the 
rack in his hands while trying to regain his balance. 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she said in amusement. Mal&#39;ek was probably one of the 
oldest denizens she knew still in active service, and it continued to 
amaze her how someone could be as active as he was at his age without 
the aid of some sort of regenerative ability. While he was rather 
irreverent at times and had little respect for rank by itself, his 
past record of service to the throne and the military rivaled that of 
most generals, which allowed him some measure of leeway with the 
formalities and other things. 

&quot;Chief....&quot; Rune said slowly as she took a good look at the label on 
the bottle of amber fluid. &quot;This is from Earth?&quot; 

Mal&#39;ek smiled. &quot;Aye, that it &#39;tis. One o&#39; y&#39;r agents picked up a bit 
o&#39; Earth spirits for me as a special favor, as I &#39;twas curious as t&#39; 
how much o&#39; a mean brew those humans could make.&quot; 

K&#39;tal scratched the back of his head. &quot;Begging the general&#39;s pardon, 
but I&#39;d be careful with that stuff if I were you. I&#39;ve heard that some 
of their alcohol is on the level of fermented le&#39;un berries.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren shivered lightly. &quot;If that&#39;s the case, General, I would take 
his advice and be careful. I don&#39;t know about you, but alcohol as 
strong as that would have me on my ptanka in very little time.&quot; 

Mal&#39;ek snorted distainfully. &quot;Here now, ye&#39;ll have none o&#39; th&#39; sort o&#39; 
problems wi&#39; this. &#39;Tis called &#39;skot&#39;ch,&#39; and while it&#39;ll have ye 
a&#39;chasin&#39; mer&#39;catas outta y&#39;r skull after about half a bottle, ye 
shouldna have any sort o&#39; problem if ye only drink a glass or two.&quot; 

&quot;And the taste?&quot; Rune inquired as she peered at the label and tried to 
translate the written words. I swear, their alphabet looks like 
something a hatchling vep&#39;tera scratched into the dirt while looking 
for food, she mused. She blinked as Mal&#39;ek plucked the bottle from her 
hands and worked the cork free. 

&quot;Try some an&#39; see,&quot; he said as he poured a small measure into a 
tumbler and held it out to her. &quot;I think &#39;tis rather smooth m&#39;self, 
but ye should always judge for y&#39;self.&quot; 

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; V&#39;Kreeth said suddenly as he took the tumbler from Mal&#39;ek 
and passed his hand over the rim of the glass. He then studied the 
pattern of dim lights on the tiny and nearly invisible scanner he held 
before he held the glass out to Rune. 

&quot;Did ye think I would poison her?&quot; Mal&#39;ek said mildly. 

&quot;No offense, Chief, but in my line of work, we can take no chances,&quot; 
the shadow replied evenly. 

Rune took the glass from him and sniffed it experimentally, blinking 
in surprise as the sharp scent made the inside of her nose start to 
burn. &quot;Mmm, smells strong enough to peel wallpaper,&quot; she commented 
before she took a sip. She swallowed and gasped as her senses seemed 
to explode momentarily before returning back to normal. 

&quot;Ye said ye wanted somethin&#39; wi&#39; a bit o&#39; a kick t&#39; it,&quot; Mal&#39;ek said 
with a twinkle in his jet black eyes. 

&quot;That.... that it does,&quot; Rune said, still slightly stunned. 

&quot;May I?&quot; Si&#39;ren asked politely as she gestured to the bottle. 

&quot;O&#39; course, help y&#39;self,&quot; Mal&#39;ek replied as he plucked another tumbler 
out of the rack and poured a small measure of scotch into it. &quot;I&#39;ll be 
headin&#39; off t&#39; bed soon, Admiral, so I hope ye&#39;ll forgive me if I don&#39; 
stick around t&#39; peel ye off o&#39; the walls when y&#39;r finished wi&#39; the 
bottle, but ye and the General are welcome t&#39; keep it,&quot; he said as he 
passed her the bottle and kept the glass for himself. &quot;I&#39;ll have a 
steward come pick up th&#39; glasses in th&#39; mornin&#39; o&#39; afternoon, 
whichever is most convenient for ye.&quot; 

&quot;Your services are most appreciated, as they always are,&quot; Rune said as 
she took another sip of the scotch. &quot;Pleasant dreams, Chief Mal&#39;ek.&quot; 

Mal&#39;ek nodded his head. &quot;And t&#39; ye as well, General Rune.&quot; He turned 
around to leave but paused in mid-motion and craned his head around to 
look at her. &quot;I heard &#39;bout th&#39; incident with th&#39; missile this 
mornin&#39;,&quot; he said very slowly, as if choosing his words carefully. 
&quot;And if&#39;n ye don&#39; mind m&#39; sayin&#39; so, ye shouldna let that pass 
lightly, but ye should also tread carefully when dealin&#39; wi&#39; th&#39; Dark 
One. Few people are aware o&#39; this, but she returned t&#39; th&#39; Imperial 
Castle &#39;bout a thousand years back, and I had the chance o&#39; bein&#39; part 
o&#39; th&#39; crew that saw t&#39; her needs while she was a&#39;visitin&#39;. Her temper 
makes Beryl&#39;s fits seem like mild farts an&#39; she&#39;s &#39;bout as warm as a 
block o&#39; ice, but t&#39; this day I ne&#39;er met one who mets out rewards an&#39; 
punishments wi&#39; as much fairness or fervor as her. She&#39;ll slice ye t&#39; 
ribbons if&#39;n you oppose her, but she&#39;ll also make tatters of whomever 
dares to e&#39;en so much as think o&#39; lookin&#39; cross-eyed at those she 
calls allies. She&#39;s a right thorny one, but t&#39; a one her soldiers 
dearly love her. I&#39;m jus&#39; sayin&#39; for ye to be careful, Rune. Fair 
evenin&#39;.&quot; 

Rune said nothing as she watched the ancient denizen shuffle down the 
hallway. She took another sip of her scotch before she crossed the 
room and closed the door, a thoughtful yet haunted expression on her 
face. &quot;So what do you think of the Chief&#39;s words?&quot; she asked softly. 
&quot;You can set the rack down over there, K&#39;tal, unless you feel like 
holding onto that all night.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; he replied as he carefully set the rack of glasses 
down in the distant corner and came back with a pair of glasses. &quot;You 
may need this, Admiral, unless you&#39;ve had one of those days,&quot; he said 
as he held out a glass tumbler to her. 

&quot;Tempting as the idea sounds, I&#39;ll stick with being civilized,&quot; Si&#39;ren 
replied as she accepted the glass and poured herself a goodly amount 
of scotch before passing the bottle to K&#39;tal. &quot;And how old is Mal&#39;ek, 
if I may ask?&quot; 

Rune did the math in her head and gave K&#39;tal a measured look. &quot;I&#39;m not 
sure on the exact numbers, but I&#39;d say he could have retired from the 
military with full honors and benefits before K&#39;tal was even an idea. 
You&#39;re what, six hundred some-odd years old, Commander?&quot; 

The skin on K&#39;tal&#39;s face darkened as he blushed. &quot;Six hundred seventy- 
three, ma&#39;am.&quot; 

Rune grunted. &quot;Okay, so perhaps while you were still in diapers, 
then.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren blinked and sat down on the bed. &quot;And I thought Al&#39;vexi had 
stayed in for an overly long time. You know....&quot; she said, pausing to 
take a sip of her scotch, &quot;I had heard a rumor that Nop&#39;tera had 
returned with the damaged carrier so long ago, but no one could ever 
prove it. If she did return briefly and Mal&#39;ek did meet her as he 
claims to, and I don&#39;t see any reason for him to lie about that, then 
I think it would be wise to consider his.... words of wisdom 
carefully.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Rune said as she sipped at her own scotch. Once you get past 
the initial kick-in-the-pants, she thought, this really does have a 
smooth taste to it. 

&quot;Personal experience notwithstanding,&quot; K&#39;tal said carefully, &quot;He does 
have a point about wanting to tread carefully. Anyone who reacts to a 
conventional missile attack with a nuclear warhead isn&#39;t someone to be 
taken lightly.&quot; 

&quot;Nor is the nuclear response,&quot; Rune said as she set her glass down on 
her nightstand with a dull thump, watching the surface of the amber 
liquid ripple. She blinked as she felt a tiny nagging sensation in her 
mind, almost as if her subconscious was trying to tell her something. 

Rune had learned long ago that it was ultimately best for her to stop 
whatever she was currently doing and try to figure things out whenever 
she got that nagging feeling. It didn&#39;t start until I set the glass 
down, she started to reason, so it&#39;s either something I did or 
something I saw.... 

K&#39;tal and Si&#39;ren both noticed Rune&#39;s gaze going vacant at the same 
time and exchanged glances, knowing full well that something had 
clicked in Rune&#39;s mind and that she was trying to work it out. Si&#39;ren 
made a gesture and K&#39;tal spread his hands, not having the slightest 
idea what Rune was thinking. They both blinked as Rune picked up her 
glass and set it back down again, watching the amber liquid slosh 
slightly and causing them to wonder if she really was thinking or if 
the alcohol was starting to have a serious effect on her. 

Ripples, Rune thought, watching the tiny rings move back and forth 
inside her glass. Almost just like what the pilots said the carrier 
did, ripple slightly before vanishing.... some sort of electromagnetic 
cloak, something that can mask both energy and light waves.... 
ripples.... waves.... light.... 

&quot;Sound,&quot; Rune suddenly said, her head snapping up fast enough to 
startle even V&#39;Kreeth. &quot;The carriers used an electromagnetic cloak to 
hide themselves, which is why we lost them both on scanner and 
visually, since light is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum. But 
what about sound waves?&quot; 

K&#39;tal blinked as he started to see where Rune was going. &quot;We might be 
able to locate the carriers by using sound waves instead of energy 
waves as a form of radar, but the range on that would be frustratingly 
small.&quot; 

&quot;Wait a minute....&quot; Si&#39;ren said as she narrowed her eyes. &quot;If those 
carriers are using propellers to keep themselves aloft, wouldn&#39;t that 
make an awfully loud noise?&quot; 

The three of them looked at each other for a brief moment before they 
tossed back what was left in their respective glasses and quickly made 
their way towards the command center, leaving V&#39;Kreeth alone in the 
room with the bottle of Earth alcohol and a collection of empty glass 
tumblers. 

He sighed quietly to himself as he eyed the bottle of amber spirits. 
&quot;And to think I don&#39;t go off-duty for another seven hours,&quot; he 
grumbled to himself as he began to straighten up the room out of 
habit. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Susan stopped and looked around her, her sense of unease becoming 
steadily worse with each passing minute. &quot;Myst,&quot; she said softly after 
another chilling wave of apprehension passed through her. &quot;Does 
something feel wrong to you?&quot; 

The gray kitten leapt out of her arms and crouched low to the ground, 
her whiskers twitching as she sniffed a spot on the ground. &quot;There 
seems to be some sort of marker imprinted on the ground here,&quot; she 
said slowly, &quot;But aside from that, it doesn&#39;t feel like anything else 
is here.&quot; 

The succubus frowned, her wings twitching slightly as she studied the 
dark landscape around her. &quot;That&#39;s the problem,&quot; she replied. 

Myst blinked and looked at her curiously. &quot;What do you mean? Mephisto 
and Alex should have returned to the pool already, so what else would 
be around here?&quot; 

Susan&#39;s red eyes narrowed as she peered into the darkness. &quot;What about 
other Shinma? Surely there should be something around here, but I 
can&#39;t sense even the slightest hint of life around here. There&#39;s an 
Earth expression that deals with situations like this,&quot; she said 
slowly. &quot;It&#39;s quiet. Too quiet.&quot; 

Myst blinked again as she considered Susan&#39;s words and carefully 
scanned the area around her. She&#39;s right, she thought as a sudden 
icyness started to make its way down her back. Even if the nearest 
creature was half an hour&#39;s walk away, I should at least be able to 
feel it&#39;s life-force. But now I can&#39;t feel anything, not even 
background auras, and it certainly wasn&#39;t this empty when we left.... 

&quot;You&#39;re right, something does feel odd....&quot; Myst said slowly. 

Without warning, several flashes of light appeared several feet away 
from them as Mephisto and Alex teleported into the area, followed by 
several other creatures. Susan took one look at the creatures and 
decided that things had just taken a drastic change for the worse. 

&quot;Susan!&quot; Mephisto yelled as he ran towards her, keeping a solid grip 
on Alex&#39;s arm and fairly dragging her along with him. &quot;Grab hold and 
don&#39;t let go!&quot; 

Susan didn&#39;t bother replying, instead scooping up Myst in one fluid 
motion and running towards him. The creatures wasted no time in 
closing the gap and were mere feet behind Mephisto when he got close 
enough to grab hold of Susan&#39;s arm. 

The contact sent painful shocks shooting across her nerves before her 
vision seemed to explode into white sparks. Then the pain set in, 
waves upon waves of pure agony that would have had her screaming if 
she had been able to do so. The sensation seemed to last for an 
eternity before the pain vanished and her vision returned to normal. 

She had just started to draw in a breath when her vision exploded once 
more and she was again beseiged by the second-worst pain of her 
several centuries of life. Time seemed to come to a virtual standstill 
before the agony abruptly disappeared and she could see straight. 

Her mind had barely begun to orient itself before her legs collapsed 
out from under her and she fell to the ground, her nerve endings still 
raw with residual pain. Beside her, she heard a disturbingly weak moan 
as Alex also slumped to the ground and tried to curl up into a tiny 
ball. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Mephisto said behind her, his voice tight with 
pain. 

&quot;Wh.... what...?&quot; Susan managed to croak out as her voice refused to 
cooperate. 

&quot;Molecular teleport,&quot; Myst whispered as she uncurled herself and tried 
to move slowly. 

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; Mephisto grunted. &quot;Alex and I teleported into a horde 
of those creatures and we&#39;ve been trying to escape them since. Problem 
was, they were able to track us and kept teleporting after us.&quot; 

&quot;D.... did we.... lose them?&quot; Susan whispered as she struggled 
valiantly into a kneeling position, casting a glance at Alex and 
trying to assess the blonde&#39;s condition. 

The Shinma grunted again. &quot;I would hope so, because I&#39;m not sure I 
could handle another incident like that,&quot; he replied. 

&quot;Next time, just let me die,&quot; Alex whispered softly, not even 
considering trying to move just yet. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Susan asked as she flexed her wings experimentally 
before folding them tightly against her back. They seemed to ripple 
briefly before shrinking in on themselves and were absorbed into the 
skin on her back, leaving only a pair of dark-colored scars behind. 

&quot;Even my name hurts right now,&quot; the blonde replied, her voice still 
very unsteady. &quot;Mephisto, what did you do to us?&quot; 

&quot;Didn&#39;t have enough time for a normal dimension shift, so I had to use 
a molecular teleport instead,&quot; he explained. 

&quot;What&#39;s the difference, aside from the pain?&quot; Susan asked as she 
shakily rose to her feet. 

&quot;A dimension shift wraps four-dimensional space around you in such a 
way as to allow you to cease to exist in one spot and resume existing 
in another. A molecular teleport does the same thing, except that 
you&#39;re getting wrapped around space instead of the other way around,&quot; 
Mephisto explained. 

&quot;So this is how taffy feels after it&#39;s been through the mixer,&quot; Alex 
grumbled as she started to slowly uncurl her body. &quot;See if I ever look 
at it the same way again.&quot; 

&quot;Where did you manage to find taffy in the Moon Kingdom?&quot; Susan 
inquired as she bent down to carefully pick up Myst. &quot;And are you 
alright?&quot; she asked the Shinma. 

&quot;I&#39;ve been better,&quot; Myst replied sourly. 

&quot;Prince Darian brought some from Earth one time and gave a bunch of it 
to the Princess,&quot; Alex said as she tried to roll over. &quot;Being the 
sugar fairy that she is, her Highness shared some of it with us and I 
swear it was a week before Lady Mercury would let us hear the end of 
it. Kept saying something about how the &#39;hideously high sugar content&#39; 
would give us all cavities. I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t remember that 
incident.&quot; 

Susan chuckled to herself, easily being able to picture the image 
given the Lady Mercury&#39;s often overwhelming concern for the health of 
the Princess and her court. &quot;If I was around when it happened, I 
assure you I would not have forgotten such a thing.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right, I forgot you have a near-perfect memory despite 
being older than three generations of Sailor Scouts put together,&quot; 
Alex muttered to herself as she struggled into a sitting position. 

The succubus merely rolled her eyes and glanced around, blinking hard 
in surprise when she realized that they had teleported into the lava 
bubble that held the mana pool. 

&quot;You&#39;re bleeding,&quot; Mephisto said suddenly as he moved over next to 
Alex and touched her shoulder. She winced at his touch and brushed his 
hand aside, making a face at the dark red stains on his fingertips. 

&quot;Great, so I guess that thing did manage to tag me after all,&quot; she 
sighed as she craned her neck to try to look at her shoulder blade. 
&quot;Oh, bah, that&#39;s just a messy scratch, nothing serious.&quot; 

&quot;Let me see,&quot; Susan said as she moved over next to the blonde. &quot;Mmm, 
it doesn&#39;t look too bad....&quot; she started to say. 

&quot;Is there an echo in here?&quot; Alex muttered. 

&quot;...but I think you&#39;re going to wind up with another scar once that 
heals in a few days,&quot; Susan finished dryly. &quot;Provided, of course, it 
doesn&#39;t get infected and make matters worse.&quot; 

&quot;Joy, another scar,&quot; Alex said as she rolled her eyes and 
unconsciously brushed her fingers across her thigh. &quot;Mich is going to 
love that one.&quot; She paused as a realization sank in and she looked 
sharply at Mephisto. &quot;You still have her soul, right?&quot; she asked 
quickly. 

&quot;Of course,&quot; he replied. &quot;One moment.&quot; 

Both Susan and Alex blinked as his body started to dissolve into 
particles that quickly collapsed into a whirling vortex. The center of 
the vortex irised open like a flower and the faintly glowing soul 
emerged from the depths, slowly floating to the ground. The vortex 
collapsed in on itself and quickly reformed into a humanoid shape, 
catching the soul before it hit the stone floor. 

&quot;That&#39;s spooky....&quot; Alex said quietly, repressing a shiver. 

Susan merely raised an eyebrow in reply as she absently scratched 
Myst&#39;s ears. &quot;How soon can you revive her?&quot; she asked Mephisto. 

&quot;I have to awaken her first, and for that I need energy,&quot; he replied 
as he turned his focus inward to his own supply of energy, extracting 
a small tendril of power and transferring it to the faded soul. 

Alex&#39;s blue eyes widened as Mephisto&#39;s arm seemed to ripple slightly 
and a glowing string of light wrapped itself around the glowing 
sphere. The string was quickly absorbed by the sphere and it began to 
glow noticeably brighter than before. 

&quot;Wait, what did you just do?&quot; she asked, her eyes still wide with 
wonder. 

&quot;Giving your friend the energy she needs to wake up,&quot; Mephisto said as 
he wrapped another tendril of energy around the soul, causing it to 
glow even brighter. &quot;You may wish to close your eyes for a moment,&quot; he 
cautioned as his arm started to ripple once more. 

Susan and Myst did so, but Alex continued to stare at the soul as the 
tendril of energy coiled itself around the soul like a snake before it 
suddenly was absorbed and the soul seemed to explode in a flash of 
light. 

&quot;Owwwww....&quot; Alex moaned as she turned her head away, briefly blinded 
by the flash. 

&quot;He did warn you,&quot; Susan said mildly as she opened her eyes, her 
vision unaffected by the effects of the light. &quot;Mmm, that certainly 
looks to be the right color.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, shut up and give me a moment,&quot; the blonde replied as she blinked 
her eyes rapidly, trying to clear the residual afterimage. She waited 
until she was able to focus on her hand before trying to look up at 
the soul. &quot;Ohh....&quot; she breathed as her eyes widened once more. 

The soul, once a dim ball of light, was now a vibrant sphere of 
aquamarine light that filled the lava bubble with it&#39;s radiance. It 
seemed to be hovering slightly above Mephisto&#39;s hand, giving it a 
slightly ethereal effect. 

&quot;I&#39;m curious,&quot; Susan said slowly as she stared at the soul. &quot;Do living 
souls always coalesce into spheres once they&#39;ve been removed from the 
body?&quot; 

Mephisto blinked, surprised by the question. &quot;You&#39;re a succubus, and 
you&#39;re asking me about souls?&quot; he said. 

Susan&#39;s lips curved into an amused smile. &quot;The key word is living 
souls. Trust me, by the time I&#39;ve extracted a soul to the point where 
I can physically see it, it&#39;s as dead as the body and in a somewhat 
liquidy form.&quot; 

Alex tried to fight off the dark shiver that crawled down her spine 
and failed miserably. &quot;Must you be so morbid?&quot; she muttered as she 
tried to calm her nerves. 

&quot;Death is an odd teacher,&quot; Susan mused. &quot;Quite effective, I assure 
you, but it extracts a toll in exchange for the knowledge.&quot; 

&quot;I would imagine so,&quot; Mephisto said after a moment of heavy silence. 
The silence continued for a number of moments before it was abruptly 
dispelled by a forceful sneeze from Myst that nearly dislodged her 
from Susan&#39;s arms. 

&quot;Whoa, you alright?&quot; Alex asked as she gave the Shinma a concerned 
look. &quot;I&#39;m surprised that didn&#39;t turn your nose inside-out.&quot; 

Myst made a sour face as she jumped down from Susan&#39;s arms and batted 
at her nose with a paw. &quot;Finally,&quot; she said. &quot;My nose had been 
tingling since we teleported here and I thought it would never work 
its way out.&quot; 

&quot;I think it&#39;s out now,&quot; Susan said mildly. 

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Myst replied as she wrinkled her nose. 

Alex glanced over at Mephisto and frowned at the look on his face. 
&quot;What is it, Mephisto?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;She awakens,&quot; he replied softly as he studied the aquamarine soul. 
&quot;I&#39;m going to revive her now. Please stand back and no matter what 
happens, don&#39;t touch the mana pool.&quot; 

Susan&#39;s head snapped around hard enough to make a joint creak 
somewhere along her spine. &quot;Mana pool? Is that what this place is?&quot; 
she said in awe. 

Alex blew her breath out hard in frustration. &quot;Why can&#39;t you two spend 
five minutes together without having to start talking about something 
that&#39;s completely over my head?&quot; she growled. 

A delicate green eyebrow rose in response. &quot;Once you&#39;ve lived among 
the inhabitants of the Underworld for a few centuries, you&#39;ll 
understand most if not all of what is said,&quot; Susan explained in mild 
amusement. 

The blonde resisted the urge to flip her off and instead settled for 
giving her a dark look. &quot;Well, in the meantime, can you try to keep it 
to a level that a mere seventeen-year-old like myself can comprehend?&quot; 
she said with a slight edge to her voice. 

Both Myst and Mephisto blinked in surprise and exchanged glances. 
&quot;You&#39;re only seventeen?&quot; Myst said amazement. 

&quot;Yup,&quot; Alex said. &quot;So how old did you think I was?&quot; she asked as she 
put her hand on her hip and gave Mephisto an appraising look. 

&quot;Significantly older, but I had forgotten about the shortness of human 
lifespans,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;I would have said no more than two 
centuries, but that would roughly be the Shinma equivalent to a human 
your age.&quot; 

Alex raised an eyebrow, clearly not amused. &quot;Two hundred years, huh?&quot; 
she said, the edge returning to her voice. 

&quot;A young two hundred,&quot; Mephisto offered in a light tone, suddenly 
sensing he may have made a mistake in voicing his opinion. 

&quot;Sue&#39;s older than dirt and most people think she looks to be in her 
young twenties. I&#39;m only seventeen and you say I look like I&#39;m two 
hundred. Thanks a lot,&quot; Alex said with a sour expression on her face. 

&quot;Perhaps we should concentrate on reviving Michelle and worry about 
our respective ages at a later time,&quot; Susan said gently, giving Alex a 
slightly reproving look. 

Mephisto nodded and started to concentrate on the glowing aquamarine 
soul. &quot;As I said earlier, do not touch the pool no matter what 
happens,&quot; he cautioned as he closed his eyes. 

Everyone watched in mute fascination as the luminescent sphere started 
to float up into the air and over the center of the pool. The soul 
paused halfway in it&#39;s journey and hovered for a moment to avoid a 
drop of mana falling from the ceiling. Once the odd ripples had 
vanished, the soul continued to move across the pool, coming to a 
brief halt a few inches from the surface before suddenly plunging deep 
into the center of the pool. As they watched, the soul began to glow 
brighter for a moment before suddenly exploding outward into several 
thousand tiny points of light that quickly faded into nothingness. 

&quot;MICH!!&quot; Alex yelled as she instinctively lunged forward, only to be 
held back by both Susan and Mephisto. 

&quot;It&#39;s supposed to do that,&quot; Susan quickly explained, cursing herself 
for not thinking to warn the blonde beforehand. &quot;Give it a few 
moments, Alex.&quot; 

In a burst of almost inhuman strength, Alex shrugged off both grips 
and lashed out, grabbing the collar of Mephisto&#39;s tunic and pinning 
him against the wall of the lava bubble. &quot;Where is she?! What 
happened?!&quot; she demanded. 

&quot;Alex, look,&quot; Susan said softly as she stared into the mana pool. 

The blonde&#39;s grip relaxed only fractionally as her head snapped around 
to look. A cloud of luminescent particles was slowly emerging from the 
depths of the pool and started to float around aimlessly. As the air 
began to grow thick with the points of light, they started to gather 
together into a glowing mass only a few feet away from Alex, glowing 
brighter and brighter with each passing second. After a few moments, 
the last of the particles merged together and suddenly gave off a 
burst of light that forced everyone to look away. 

&quot;Oww, damn!&quot; Alex moaned as her eyes began to tear from the overload. 
It took several moments before the pain in her retinas subsided enough 
for her to open her eyes, and it took her another few moments before 
she was able to focus on the nude female figure lying next to her. 

&quot;Michelle!&quot; she cried out as she recognized the wavy aquamarine hair 
of her friend. She fairly tossed Mephisto aside as she scrambled over 
to her, gently taking Michelle&#39;s hand in her own and carefully looking 
her over for any obvious sign of injury. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Susan quietly asked Mephisto as she too looked over 
the inert form for any abnormal indications. 

&quot;I&#39;ve had better days,&quot; he replied with faint amusement. 

There was a soft moan as Michelle started to stir. Alex reached up and 
brushed away a few stands of aquamarine hair that had fallen over 
Michelle&#39;s face. &quot;Easy, love,&quot; the blonde said softly. &quot;Don&#39;t move 
just yet.&quot; 

&quot;A.... Alex?&quot; Michelle whispered faintly as she tried to open her 
eyes. 

&quot;Right here, hon,&quot; Alex replied with a gentle smile. 

&quot;Wh.... what happened?&quot; Michelle asked as her eyelids finally 
fluttered open. It took her a few moments before she was able to focus 
on Alex, and she blinked as she saw the patch of blood on her 
shoulder. &quot;You&#39;re bleeding!&quot; she exclaimed and immediately tried to 
sit up. 

&quot;Whoa, I said don&#39;t move yet,&quot; Alex said as she gently pushed her back 
down. &quot;I&#39;m fine. You, however, could use some work. Rest for a 
moment.&quot; 

Michelle closed her eyes and sighed for a moment before they suddenly 
snapped back open and gave Alex a slightly wary look. &quot;Wait.... what 
did you do with my clothes?&quot; she said with a slight edge to her voice. 

The corners of the blonde&#39;s mouth twitched in amusement. &quot;I haven&#39;t a 
clue,&quot; she replied softly, &quot;But I thought you liked being naked with 
me....&quot; 

Michelle immediately blushed and looked away. &quot;Of course I do,&quot; she 
whispered. &quot;However, there is a time and place for that, and somehow I 
don&#39;t think this is either. Where are we?&quot; she asked as she glanced 
around. 

&quot;I see you haven&#39;t changed much,&quot; Susan said as she moved over and 
knelt down next to Alex. &quot;Welcome back.&quot; 

&quot;Susan!&quot; Michelle said happily and tried to sit up again. She grimaced 
as her muscles protested but she refused to give up, finally managing 
to achieve a sitting position with Alex&#39;s help. 

&quot;Easy, love, don&#39;t strain yourself,&quot; Alex said with concern. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be alright once this headache goes away,&quot; Michelle replied as 
she looked around the lava bubble. &quot;I&#39;ll be even better when I find my 
clothes, but in the meantime could someone tell me just where 
exactlEEEEEEEE!&quot; she screeched as she saw a fully clothed man looking 
at her nude body. 

&quot;WHOA!&quot; Alex yelped as Michelle yanked her off-balance and she tumbled 
to the ground in front of her, effectively hiding Michelle&#39;s state of 
undress from everyone else in the lava bubble. &quot;Jeez, girl, warn me 
before you do that!&quot; 

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Michelle demanded, blushing furiously with 
embarrassment. 

&quot;Perhaps I should do the introductions,&quot; Susan suggested before 
Mephisto could open his mouth. &quot;Michelle, I would like you to meet the 
Shinma Mephisto. The lunar cat is another Shinma named Myst. Both of 
them saved our souls and restored our bodies. Mephisto, this is 
Michelle Kaiou, the avatar of Neptune.&quot; 

Michelle blinked and could only nod a polite greeting to Mephisto. 
Alex saw the deer-caught-in-headlights look on Michelle&#39;s face and 
sighed quietly. &quot;Mich here is rather shy with people. We&#39;re both very 
grateful for your assistance up to this point, Mephisto, and I was 
wondering if I might ask a bit of a favor of you....&quot; Alex said 
slowly, trying to soothe a slightly disturbed Michelle. 

&quot;Clothing, I would imagine,&quot; Mephisto said as he moved closer to her. 
&quot;If you would stand for a moment....?&quot; he said as he held out his 
hand. 

Michelle hesitated for a moment as she considered her options and Alex 
sighed softly to herself. &quot;He already looked over your luscious bod 
while you were still unconscious, dear, so there&#39;s no use in hiding it 
now. C&#39;mon, time to get up,&quot; she said as she stood up, grabbing 
Michelle&#39;s arm in the process and hauling her up with her. 

Susan raised an eyebrow at the intensity of the blush on Michelle&#39;s 
face. It has always amazed me how someone as shy and reserved as 
Michelle could be so deeply involved with someone as forceful and 
outgoing as Alex, she thought to herself in amusement. But neither one 
seems to mind, so to each their own.... 

It took Michelle a moment to regain her balance before she could 
extend her hand to Mephisto, giving the Shinma an uncertain and 
slightly wary look. Mephisto merely took her hand in his and gave her 
a soft smile. 

She nearly yelped in surprise as a soft white glow enveloped her hand 
and quickly spread across her arm. The glow continued to expand until 
her entire body was covered by the soft radiance. She blinked as her 
skin started to tingle for a moment before the glow faded as quickly 
as it had come. 

Alex waited until the glow had faded before she turned around and took 
a step back to look at Michelle. She blinked hard and let out a soft 
whistle of appreciation at what she saw. &quot;Damn, you do good work,&quot; she 
breathed. 

Michelle glanced down and blinked as well. &quot;Ooooh, this looks nice,&quot; 
she said as she studied the aquamarine gown she was now wearing. She 
hiked the hem up a few inches to look over the matching low-heeled 
shoes she was wearing and nodded. &quot;Shoes are a good match, too. Thank 
you, Mephisto,&quot; she said as she glanced up at the Shinma and gave him 
a shy smile. 

&quot;My pleasure,&quot; Mephisto replied as he kissed the hand he was holding, 
causing a furious blush to appear on Michelle&#39;s cheeks. 

Alex frowned and reached out, tugging Michelle&#39;s hand free from 
Mephisto&#39;s grasp and holding it tightly in her own gentle grip. &quot;Hey, 
now, no one gets to kiss her but me,&quot; she said with a faint edge to 
her voice. 

Mephisto blinked hard in surprise, at a momentary loss for words. 
Myst, who had been quietly watching the scene from the corner of the 
lava bubble, moved forward and gave all three girls a very curious 
look. &quot;I don&#39;t quite understand the relationship between you three. 
Can you explain it to me?&quot; she asked cautiously. 

Alex and Michelle exchanged glances before Michelle blushed and a 
smirk appeared on Alex&#39;s lips. They both looked at Susan as the 
succubus coughed lightly and gave Alex a reproving look. &quot;I think I&#39;ll 
handle this one, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; she said with a hint of amusement 
in her voice. 

&quot;Spoilsport,&quot; Alex muttered as the smirk grew wider. 

&quot;We are all avatars from the Moon Kingdom,&quot; Susan began explaining. 
&quot;As I&#39;ve inherited my father&#39;s eternal lifespan, I have been serving 
the Kingdom for many generations and knew both Alex and Michelle 
before they were born. Since I&#39;ve not only changed their diapers but 
also helped to train them as Sailor Scouts, we&#39;ve become very good 
friends over the years.&quot; 

Both Alex and Michelle blushed at the mention of being diapered. 
&quot;That&#39;s great, Sue,&quot; Alex muttered. &quot;Why don&#39;t you just show them the 
baby pictures while you&#39;re at it?&quot; 

&quot;If I had them with me, I would,&quot; Susan replied evenly, resisting the 
urge to smirk in satisfaction as Alex&#39;s blush deepened. &quot;As for the 
relationship between Alex and Michelle, they&#39;ve been the best of 
friends since they were able to crawl. However, over the years their 
relationship has....&quot; She paused as she searched for a suitable word. 

&quot;Evolved?&quot; Michelle suggested softly as she edged behind Alex. 

Susan thought about it for a moment before shrugged. &quot;A good word as 
any. Their relationship evolved beyond friendship and into what can 
only be thought of as a serious romance.&quot; 

Mephisto blinked. &quot;Romance?&quot; he echoed, giving Alex and Michelle a 
mildly confused look. 

Alex smirked again as she felt Michelle&#39;s arms around her waist and 
felt her leaning against her back, seeking the comfort of the blonde&#39;s 
presence. &quot;In other words, we&#39;re lovers,&quot; Alex said with a touch of 
pride. 

Susan studied the expression on Mephisto&#39;s face and frowned lightly as 
she couldn&#39;t immediately identify it. It&#39;s not shock, she thought 
silently. Surprise, yes, but not much of it.... Her dark red eyes 
narrowed for a moment before they suddenly snapped wide open and 
blinked in surprise. Could that have been.... disappointment? she 
thought for a moment before she forced her facial expression to return 
to normal. 

&quot;I see....&quot; Mephisto said slowly, his expression changing to one of 
faint amusement. &quot;That does explain matters. Forgive me, I meant no 
transgression,&quot; he said with a bow towards Michelle. 

&quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Alex said with a wave of her hand. &quot;Just 
as long as you don&#39;t try to kiss her again, I won&#39;t feel compelled to 
injure you.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll try to keep that in mind,&quot; the Shinma replied somewhat dryly. 

&quot;Hello there,&quot; Michelle said softly as she knelt down to pet Myst. 
&quot;How are you doing?&quot; 

Myst blinked as Michelle began to scratch behind her ears. &quot;You humans 
are strange creatures,&quot; the cat said with a slight frown. Michelle 
froze in mid-motion and blinked, giving Alex and Susan a slightly 
uncertain look. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think she was paying attention,&quot; Susan observed with 
amusement. 

&quot;To what?&quot; Michelle asked, slightly wary. 

&quot;You tell her, Sue, I&#39;m having too much fun with this,&quot; Alex said with 
a grin, thoroughly enjoying Michelle&#39;s state of confusion. 

&quot;Tell me what?&quot; Michelle demanded as she tried to decide whether she 
should be getting angry or worried. 

Susan raised a slender eyebrow. &quot;That&#39;s not a lunar cat you&#39;re 
petting,&quot; she explained gently. 

Alex had to bite down hard on her tongue to keep herself from bursting 
out laughing at the expression on Michelle&#39;s face. &quot;Relax, hon, Myst 
won&#39;t hurt you unless you do something that would get you clawed by 
any other lunar cat.&quot; 

&quot;The voice of experience, no doubt,&quot; Susan added, unable to resist. 

&quot;I think you need to go get laid again. Your sense of humor is 
starting to wear thin,&quot; Alex replied evenly without looking at the 
succubus. 

&quot;Umm.... if you&#39;re not a lunar cat, then what are you?&quot; Michelle 
asked. 

&quot;Shinma,&quot; Myst replied. 

&quot;A species of outcast demons,&quot; Susan explained as Michelle gave her a 
blank look. &quot;Granted they are far from harmless, but I assure you that 
these two bear us no ill will and in fact have gone to great lengths 
to help us.&quot; 

&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; Mephisto interrupted gently, &quot;Now that you&#39;ve 
found your friends, we need to return you to your kingdom.&quot; 

Michelle&#39;s aquamarine eyes went wide as the mention of the Moon 
Kingdom caused a memory to bubble up from the depths of her mind. 
&quot;Susan, the battle!&quot; she exclaimed as she quickly stood up. 

Susan sighed quietly and held up a hand to silence any further 
potential outbursts. &quot;The battle has been over for some time,&quot; she 
explained softly, &quot;So there is no need to be concerned about that.&quot; 

Alex frowned as Susan&#39;s words triggered her own memories. &quot;For how 
long? You still haven&#39;t told me how long we were dead or whatever it 
was that we were,&quot; the blonde said, her eyes narrowed. 

The succubus sighed again, feeling the weight of her years bearing 
down upon her already overburdened soul. &quot;Alex....&quot; she started to 
say. 

&quot;How long?!&quot; Alex demanded as Michelle moved slightly behind her, one 
hand gently wrapping around the blonde&#39;s wrist. 

&quot;A thousand years,&quot; Susan said softly. 

The silence in the lava bubble was so sudden it echoed. The only sound 
that could be heard for several seconds was the sound of a drop of 
mana falling into the pool. 

&quot;A thousand years?&quot; Michelle asked, almost too softly to hear. Susan 
nodded in response and she began to tremble with the realization. 
&quot;But.... what about the Kingdom?&quot; 

&quot;You know as much as I do right now,&quot; the succubus replied. 

&quot;Queen Serenity....&quot; Alex said softly, &quot;The Princess.... the other 
Sailor Scouts.... they&#39;re all gone, aren&#39;t they? Even if we won, they 
would have.... I mean....&quot; 

&quot;Susan, can you take us back in Time?&quot; Michelle asked. &quot;Perhaps to a 
point just a few days after.... whatever it was that sent us here?&quot; 

&quot;I cannot,&quot; Susan said with a shake of her head. 

Alex frowned. &quot;Wait, Sue, I know you feel about taking others with you 
when you time travel, especially in the past, but this is 
something....&quot; 

&quot;I CANNOT!&quot; Susan screamed, her temper snapping for one brief moment 
and causing everyone to jump back, cringing with fear. She sighed and 
closed her eyes as she struggled to regain her composure. &quot;Even if the 
Rules allowed me to send us back, it is impossible for me or anyone 
else to travel through Time anymore.&quot; 

Michelle blinked. &quot;Why? What happened?&quot; 

Susan opened her eyes and stared into the mana pool. &quot;My staff was 
destroyed during the fight, and that release of temporal energy is 
what trapped our souls here in the first place. Without that staff, 
without the Key to Time, the Portal of Time is sealed shut.&quot; 

Alex and Michelle exchanged looks of horror. Neither of them had been 
able to fully grasp the celestial mechanics involved in time travel, 
but Susan had managed to explain a few of the basics about the Portal 
and the Key, and how the interaction of the two helped keep the fabric 
of the Universe from tearing apart at the seams. 

&quot;Wait a moment,&quot; Mephisto said slowly as something clicked in his 
mind. &quot;Susan, you&#39;re one of the Guardians of Time?&quot; 

Susan nodded and ignored the sudden ball of ice in her gut. &quot;Yes.&quot; 

The Shinma blinked hard. &quot;But if you&#39;re an avatar, then why...?&quot; 

She sighed heavily, once more feeling the weight of her 
responsibilites on her soul. &quot;It is not something I wish to discuss,&quot; 
she said softly. 

Mephisto blinked hard again, not completely understanding what he was 
hearing. He let out his breath silently and nodded after a moment of 
silence. &quot;As you wish, then.&quot; 

Alex and Michelle looked at each other and merely shook their heads, 
not having the slightest idea what Susan was talking about. &quot;Think she 
was like this way back when she first became a Sailor Scout?&quot; Alex 
asked Michelle in a hushed tone, receiving a wry look and a whispered, 
&quot;Probably....&quot; in reply. 

Susan shot them both a reproving look before looking at Mephisto. &quot;In 
any case, the three of us need to return to the Moon Kingdom as soon 
as we can manage to find a way back. I am very grateful for your 
assistance up to this point, Mephisto, and your&#39;s as well, Myst, but 
considering what you&#39;ve already done for us I can&#39;t ask you to do 
anything more.&quot; 

Mephisto chuckled to himself for a brief moment. &quot;Come now, my dear 
Guardian, you would have us rescue you and your friends, and then do 
nothing to aid you in returning to your post?&quot; He shook his head and 
chuckled again before his moment of humor passed and he looked up at 
Susan. &quot;Besides, think of what might happen if Lord Hades were to hear 
of mere Shinma helping to return his avatar to his side.&quot; 

Susan blinked. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked as she narrowed her eyes. 

&quot;The Shinma as a whole have been condemned since the creation of the 
Underworld as the result of the actions of a handful of demons. If 
Lord Hades were to realize that perhaps not all Shinma are as.... 
unruly as the original traitors, then perhaps he might be willing to 
let some of us return to the Underworld and take our places as his 
minions.&quot; 

Susan considered that for a moment while Alex knelt down to pick up 
Myst. &quot;Can you tell us what they&#39;re talking about this time?&quot; she 
asked the gray cat as she started to scratch behind her ears. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Myst said with a silent sigh as she gave up trying to 
understand the human interest in holding and petting her. 

&quot;I was wondering why a Shinma would willingly help a demon,&quot; Susan 
said carefully after a moment&#39;s thought. &quot;After all, ulterior motives 
are common to both species.&quot; 

The temperature in the lava bubble seemed to drop by twenty degrees as 
Mephisto spoke. &quot;I had once heard that the demon society had somehow 
managed to become civilized in the countless centuries since the 
Creation, perhaps even becoming enlightened to the concept of treating 
others as you would like to be treated. Obviously that information was 
in error.&quot; 

&quot;Whoa, time out,&quot; Alex said as she carefully handed Myst to Michelle. 
&quot;Susan, what the hell are you doing? I&#39;m not going to pretend I know 
even a fraction of the full story between you two, but as far as I 
know, Mephisto has done quite a lot for us and I have yet to hear him 
ask for anything in return. And now all of a sudden you&#39;re picking a 
fight?&quot; 

The succubus shook her head slowly. &quot;That is not my intention, I 
assure the both of you. I am merely trying to ascertain why we have 
been receiving an unprecedented amount of help from a historical.... 
adversary is a bad word, but the relations between demons and Shinma 
have never been what you would call cordial.&quot; 

&quot;Not that we don&#39;t have a justified reason to resent our 
imprisonment,&quot; Mephisto said evenly, his voice still tinged with 
frost. &quot;Tell me, avatar of our Lord Hades, what crimes have I 
committed to deserve such punishment?&quot; 

Susan said nothing for several seconds, listening to the sounds of 
falling drops of mana and the rhythmic beating of her own heart. &quot;As I 
said before,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;It is not my intention to upset or 
offend you. Indeed, I am very much in your debt for your assistance, 
whatever your intentions may be. If you were to come me when I return 
to the Underworld, I am reasonably sure that Lord Hades would give you 
an audience for what you may have to say about The Dark and it&#39;s 
inhabitants.&quot; 

Mephisto nodded slowly. &quot;Very well, then.&quot; 

&quot;Okay,&quot; Alex said as she clapped her hands and rubbed them together. 
&quot;Now that you two seem to be finished with your usual round of verbal 
fencing, can we crank this party up and get out of here? Like I said 
before, this puddle of whatever is pretty to look at, but we need a 
change of scenery and I really, REALLY need to find a bathroom 
sometime soon.&quot; 

Mephisto and Susan exchanged amused looks and the succubus nodded. 
&quot;She has a valid, if unrefined, point,&quot; Susan said. 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; the Shinma mused. &quot;In any case, we are going to need to move 
to another location. The type of gate I can open operates on fixed 
points between the origin and destination. In order to open the gate I 
used to visit your Moon Kingdom, we will need to be standing in a 
particular place in The Dark. Fortunately, I marked that place so I 
could return if I ever needed to.&quot; 

&quot;Great!&quot; Alex said as she smiled at Michelle. 

&quot;Unfortunately....&quot; Mephisto continued. 

&quot;Wait, let me guess,&quot; the blonde grumbled, &quot;It&#39;s in the middle of a 
chunk of land infested with all sorts of evil and hungry critters.&quot; 

&quot;Your insight is astonishing,&quot; Mephisto said dryly. 

&quot;How long will it take to open the gate after we arrive?&quot; Susan asked. 

Mephisto sighed. &quot;The problem is not the timing but the energy. When 
the gate first starts to form, it will give off a burst of energy that 
will be detected by every Shinma within three miles. Granted the gate 
will start to open seconds after that, but that&#39;s more than enough 
time for the curious to start teleporting to us.&quot; 

&quot;They&#39;re not going to be hostile or anything, are they?&quot; Michelle 
asked cautiously, nervously stroking Myst in a failed effort to calm 
down. 

Everyone exchanged glances before Alex sighed. &quot;Love, saying they&#39;ll 
be hostile is like saying the Princess likes sugar. In other words, 
bet on it.&quot; 

Mephisto made a gesture towards the mana pool and a drop started to 
float up into the air. &quot;Are we ready then?&quot; he asked. 

&quot;One moment,&quot; Susan said as she concentrated. The skin on her back 
seemed to ripple and pulse before exploding outwards as her wings 
emerged. She flexed them experimentally for a few seconds before she 
nodded to Mephisto. 

Mephisto briefly glanced at the looks on Alex and Michelle&#39;s faces at 
the demonic transformation before shaking his head. &quot;Very well then,&quot; 
he said as he concentrated. The drop of mana darted towards him and 
splashed against his outstretched hand. A tremendous amount of energy 
began to surge through the Shinma as he shifted his mental focus to 
the fabric of space surrounding them. 

They seemed to shimmer briefly as four-dimensional space was folded 
around them in a complex quasi-geometrical shape. Then as soon as it 
had started, space unfolded itself into it&#39;s normal shape, leaving 
behind an empty cavern. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Molly sighed quietly to herself as she closed her eyes and laid back 
on the grass. Her ears heard the sounds of hungry seagulls flying over 
the city&#39;s artificial lake, but her mind was far too preoccupied to 
pay any attention to the minor distractions around her. 

It&#39;s got to be a coincidence, she thought to herself. So Ami&#39;s got a 
boyfriend with the same exotic name as the person from the Negaverse 
that&#39;s been helping Sailor Mercury learn his language. I&#39;ve seen 
Mercury in action and somehow I can&#39;t imagine a bookworm like Ami 
being that physically active, with all that running around and whatnot 
they do. 

Molly&#39;s green eyes snapped open as a thought crossed her mind. 
However, if Ami has been trained in martial arts like Mina said, that 
would mean that Ami would have been physically active like that, and 
for quite some time, so it is possible.... maybe. 

She sighed quietly again as she closed her eyes and rubbed her 
temples. This seemed a lot easier to think about an hour ago, she 
thought, but now I&#39;m really starting to wonder. Ami Mizuno as Sailor 
Mercury? Yeah, they&#39;ve got the same color hair, but I also know three 
other girls with blue hair, although none of them keep it short like 
Ami does.... Or Mercury.... 

Molly almost giggled to herself. C&#39;mon, girl, I&#39;ve seen them both 
really up close and personal, and they don&#39;t look much alike. However, 
she thought, neither did Superman and Clark Kent. Now there&#39;s a 
sobering idea. Could whatever power they use as Sailor Scouts also 
disguise what they really look like? Why not ask? 

This time she did giggle to herself. That&#39;s it, your brain has 
cracked, she thought. Why don&#39;t I just walk up to them next time we 
happen to run into each other, look Mercury in the eye, and ask, &quot;Hey, 
aren&#39;t you Ami Mizuno?&quot; And if pigs could fly.... 

&quot;Molly?&quot; a voice asked gently. &quot;Do you mind if we talk to you for a 
few minutes?&quot; 

It took Molly a full second to decide whether or not she had indeed 
lost her mind and was now hearing the voices of the Sailor Scouts in 
her head before she remembered to open her eyes. The sight of two 
Sailor Scouts standing over her didn&#39;t disturb her nearly as much as 
the fact that one of them was indeed Sailor Mercury. 

The redhead scrambled to her feet, a mixture of surprise and panic in 
her eyes. &quot;H... hello,&quot; she stammered out as her tongue suddenly 
seemed to twist itself into knots and her stomach started doing 
aerobics on its own. She blinked in surprise as she noticed that 
Mercury was wearing some sort of blue plastic visor over her eyes and 
that she held some sort of compact device in her hand. 

&quot;Are you doing okay after that incident this afternoon?&quot; Mercury asked 
as she discreetly scanned Molly with her computer and read the results 
on her Virtual Visor. Heart rate, blood pressure, and adrenaline 
levels are all abnormally high, she thought to herself. Perhaps that 
meeting with Reish&#39;id rattled her harder than I thought.... 

&quot;I&#39;ve had better days,&quot; Molly replied with obvious nervousness. 

Sailor Moon blinked. &quot;Are you alright, Molly? You sound like you&#39;re a 
little strung-out.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve just got a lot on my mind, that&#39;s all,&quot; the redhead replied. 
&quot;Hey, how come you didn&#39;t show up this afternoon with everyone else?&quot; 
she asked as the thought suddenly came to mind. 

Sailor Moon blushed a delicate shade of pink. &quot;Well, I was busy taking 
care of some other business at the time.&quot; 

&quot;Things don&#39;t always happen in just one place,&quot; Mercury added, hoping 
Molly wouldn&#39;t inquire further. &quot;You said you&#39;ve got a lot to think 
about?&quot; She received a nod in reply and added, &quot;Is there anything in 
particular you&#39;d like to talk about?&quot; 

Molly was about to stall for time when they heard a voice cutting 
across the park. &quot;Oh, look, Sailor Scouts!&quot; 

Sailor Moon gave Mercury a strange look as the vampire cringed. 
&quot;Great, just p&#39;takh&#39;enn great,&quot; Mercury muttered beneath her breath as 
the voice&#39;s owner fairly bounded across the path towards them, toting 
a somewhat oversized and seemingly weighty backback. 

&quot;Howdy!&quot; Sailor V said cheerfully with a smile, her blue eyes 
twinkling behind the oversized red glasses she wore. 

&quot;Hello, V,&quot; Mercury said somewhat tiredly. Sailor V&#39;s usually cocky, 
overconfident, and somewhat arrogant attitude never failed to irritate 
her, and today was no exception. Why V and not Sailor Venus? she 
thought to herself as she glanced at the backpack. A thought crossed 
her mind and she frowned. I hope she wasn&#39;t messing around on the 
black market again.... 

&quot;My, aren&#39;t we in a cheerful mood,&quot; V teased as she set the backpack 
down with a heavy thump and a nearly silent rattle that only Mercury&#39;s 
vampiric hearing could detect. &quot;Did somebody dye your cat purple or 
something?&quot; 

&quot;The voice of experience?&quot; Mercury shot back, unable to resist 
reminding her about the time she had forcibly given Artemis a bath and 
grabbed the wrong bottle from the closet. It had taken two weeks to 
get the dye out of his normally white fur and even longer for him to 
start speaking to her again. 

&quot;Ha ha, funny girl,&quot; V replied, her voice dripping acid. 

Molly blinked as she alternated her gaze between Mercury and V. &quot;Are 
you two related or something?&quot; she asked hesitantly. &quot;You sound as bad 
as two of my friends.&quot; 

Sailor V looked at Mercury for a moment before bursting out laughing, 
causing Mercury to raise an eyebrow. &quot;Heavens no,&quot; said when she could 
draw enough breath to speak. &quot;Mercury&#39;s just the type that needs to 
learn how to let her hair down, so to speak, and to enjoy life a 
little bit more. She can&#39;t stand cheery types like yours truly.&quot; 

&quot;Which friends are you referring to?&quot; Sailor Moon asked before Mercury 
could formulate a suitable reply. &quot;Who knows, we might even know 
them.&quot; 

&quot;You might,&quot; Molly said with a slight shrug. &quot;Serena and Rei. They&#39;re 
okay friends for the most part, but they do have the tendency to snipe 
at each other for sometimes hours at a time.&quot; 

&quot;You know, I think I might know them,&quot; V said slowly, trying not to 
burst out laughing as she watched the corner of Sailor Moon&#39;s mouth 
start to twitch. 

&quot;So what brings you here?&quot; Mercury asked, stalling for time as she 
tried to figure out a way to get the situation under some semblance of 
control. I&#39;m not sure which is more important, she thought to herself, 
getting Molly to talk about what she knows, keeping Sailor Moon calmed 
down, or figuring out how to get rid of Sailor V. 

&quot;Oh, just a little shopping,&quot; V said as casually as she could while 
she fought the sudden icy chill that had started to work its way down 
her spine. Oh, boy, she thought, I can see this one coming down the 
pipe.... &quot;Even Sailor Scouts need to stock up on this and that every 
now and then, you know. So what brings you two out here?&quot; 

Mercury opened her mouth to give a rather evasive answer when she 
heard several voices coming from the bus that had just pulled up to 
the sidewalk at the edge of the park. A small red flag went up in her 
mind as she glanced at the chronometer in the upper corner of her 
visor. The elementary after-school bus, she thought with a heavy sigh. 
Fifty-someodd little kids who all just noticed three Sailor Scouts 
standing around, which means all hell is going to break loose in the 
next thirty seconds.... 

Sailor V frowned at the sudden change in Mercury&#39;s expression. She 
turned her head to look at the sudden profusion of noise and blinked. 
&quot;After-school bus?&quot; she asked softly. 

&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Mercury replied. Twenty-four seconds.... 

V smiled sweetly. &quot;My biggest fan club.&quot; 

&quot;Good, you go deal with them and let me finish taking care of Molly,&quot; 
she said softly as the bus doors opened. The kids instantly started to 
scramble off and began to move with all the speed and grace of a 
stampede towards Sailor Moon. Sailor Moon smiled and started waving to 
the horde, which only made them move with that much more motivation. 
Fifteen seconds.... 

V blinked hard. &quot;Problem?&quot; she asked in all seriousness, her concern 
temporarily overriding her usual streetwise attitude. 

&quot;We think she might know our identities after meeting with Reish&#39;id,&quot; 
Mercury answered. &quot;I&#39;m trying to find out how much she knows, if 
anything,&quot; she added as she watched the stampede draw closer, the 
noise level already starting to overload her vampiric hearing. Six 
seconds.... 

V smiled. &quot;Okay, let me handle Molly. You and Sailor Moon go do some 
autographs and all. It&#39;s about time you spent some time basking in the 
public spotlight,&quot; she added as she waved her arms. &quot;Hey everyone! Who 
wants to meet Sailor Mercury, live and in person?&quot; she called out, 
causing half of the stampede to abruptly change course towards her. 

&quot;I&#39;ll get you for this,&quot; Mercury growled softly as she was surrounded 
by a horde of elementary school children, all pleading that she give 
autographs and answer their questions about Sailor Scouts. 

&quot;Maybe later,&quot; V said cheerfully as she quietly slipped away from the 
crowd. It&#39;s absolutely amazing how often I can get away without being 
noticed, she thought to herself as she glanced towards Sailor Moon. 
Like Mercury, she too was up to her armpits in little kids trying to 
get her autograph, although unlike Mercury, she didn&#39;t seem to mind 
the attention. 

&quot;So what do you think of the rugrat patrol?&quot; V asked quietly as she 
moved next to Molly. 

Molly blinked. &quot;I don&#39;t see how you can deal with that many little 
kids on a regular basis.&quot; 

V shrugged. &quot;The price of being a celebrity. You do get used to it 
after a few months of practice and patience, but it does get old after 
awhile.&quot; 

&quot;So how come they&#39;re not mobbing you like the other Sailor Scouts?&quot; 
Molly observed as she watched the two groups. 

V snickered. &quot;Easy, I&#39;ve been around longer than they have and I&#39;ve 
done this sort of thing before. They&#39;re used to seeing me here and 
there, but they don&#39;t get to meet the Sailor Scouts very often. I 
guess you can say I&#39;m like the old toy at the bottom of the toybox, 
ignored in favor of the newer ones.&quot; 

Molly nodded, knowing exactly what she meant. &quot;Umm, would you mind if 
I asked you a few questions?&quot; she said hesitantly, not quite sure how 
to deal with a minor celebrity face-to-face. 

&quot;Only if I can ask you a few questions in return,&quot; V said 
mischieviously. 

The redhead blinked at that. &quot;Umm.... sure,&quot; she said after a moment. 

&quot;Okay, then, shoot,&quot; V replied as she clasped her hands behind her 
back. 

&quot;Are you a Sailor Scout like they are?&quot; Molly asked. 

&quot;Ouch,&quot; V sighed. &quot;Not really. Granted I&#39;ve got what it takes to kick 
butt and take names, but not on the level of what they do. I go after 
people like bank robbers and drug dealers. Yeah, I&#39;ve worked with them 
on occasion, and there have been times when I&#39;ve saved their 
collective bacon and they&#39;ve saved mine, but what they do on a 
day-to-day basis is on a completely different scale. Actually, now 
that I think about it, I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;ve worked with them so much as 
had either the good or the bad luck to blunder into them from time to 
time.&quot; 

Molly nodded. &quot;So what exactly do they do?&quot; 

V frowned slightly and gave the redhead a measured look. &quot;From what 
I&#39;ve been told about you, Molly Baker, you could probably tell me a 
few things about what they do.&quot; 

Molly blinked. &quot;What have you heard about me?&quot; she asked, not entirely 
sure she wanted to know. 

&quot;This and that,&quot; V said evenly. &quot;Mostly rumors, things like that you 
know Sailor Moon personally, that you know the Sailor Scouts&#39; true 
identities, that you were involved with the Negaverse, more often than 
not as a victim of a plot as opposed to voluntarily becoming friends 
with some of their agents, things you&#39;d hear on the grapevine and all. 
Speaking of which, it&#39;s my turn to ask you a question.&quot; 

Molly blinked again as she struggled to sort out the sudden deluge of 
information. &quot;Okay....&quot; she said slowly. 

&quot;How much of that is true?&quot; V asked. 

&quot;What?&quot; 

V sighed. &quot;I&#39;m just curious as to how much of that is fruit from the 
grapevine and how much of that is actually true. I know the Sailor 
Scouts personally, but I don&#39;t know their true identities, and just 
between you and me, I don&#39;t ever want to find out.&quot; 

Molly blinked for the third time in as many minutes. &quot;What do you 
mean?&quot; 

&quot;Let me try to explain it like this. I have to keep my identity a 
secret because I&#39;ve put some people in jail. If they found out who I 
was, they&#39;d probably come after me once they got out. But if they know 
someone who does know my true identity, they&#39;d probably go after them 
in order to get to me. You know what Sailor Moon and the others have 
dealt with. If the Negaverse were to ever find out their true 
identities, they could come after not only them whenever they wanted 
to, but their friends and families as well. The only thing that keeps 
them safe is the fact that once they revert to their secret 
identities, the Sailor Scouts effectively drop off the face of the 
planet.&quot; 

Sailor V sighed and rubbed at a kink in her neck. &quot;I guess what I&#39;m 
babbling about is that if you do know something, go talk to one of the 
Sailor Scouts as quietly as you can, tell them what you know, and then 
do your very best to forget that you know. Personally I&#39;d suggest 
talking to Mercury, as she seems to have the brains of the group, but 
you didn&#39;t hear me say that,&quot; she added with an impish smile. 

Molly just nodded, her mind already deep in thought about the 
situation. How many times has the Negaverse come after me to get to 
Sailor Moon? she thought, the realization sending a dark chill down 
her spine. I don&#39;t know who she is, but if they think I do.... 

&quot;I can hear the gears turning in your brain,&quot; V observed. &quot;Something 
on your mind?&quot; 

&quot;I think I understand what you mean,&quot; Molly replied. 

V breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Good, I wasn&#39;t sure I could throw 
anything more at you if it didn&#39;t click,&quot; she said with another impish 
smile. 

Molly blinked before she chuckled. &quot;Thanks.... I think.&quot; 

&quot;Anytime. Hang on for a few, I gotta go rescue Mercury. She&#39;s new to 
the publicity thing and she&#39;s probably stressed out to the point of 
wanting to bite someone by now,&quot; V said as she walked over to the 
group of children still mobbing Sailor Mercury. &quot;Are we having fun 
yet?&quot; she asked cheerfully. 

&quot;Sailor V!&quot; the crowd replied enthusiastically. 

&quot;That&#39;s me,&quot; she said as she struck a stylized pose, drawing a cheer 
from the horde of kids. &quot;So how are you holding up?&quot; she asked Mercury 
as she accepted a pen and pad of paper from someone to do an 
autograph. 

&quot;This is probaby the best method of birth control I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; 
Mercury replied quietly as she finished what she dearly hoped was her 
last autograph. 

&quot;But think of how much you want to be a pediatrician!&quot; V teased. She 
blinked suddenly as her use of the elementary &quot;p-word&quot; caused about a 
full second&#39;s worth of silence. 

&quot;You&#39;re a doctor?&quot; a little girl asked Mercury. 

&quot;I&#39;m not, at least not yet. My mother is a doctor, though,&quot; Mercury 
replied. 

&quot;Do you have a band-aid? I scratched myself on the bus,&quot; she said as 
she held out her arm. 

Mercury blinked as she took a closer look. The scratch was a minor 
one, although it was deep enough to cause it to slowly ooze blood. 
&quot;Umm, I don&#39;t have....&quot; she started to say. 

V clapped her on the shoulder. &quot;Hold that thought, Doc,&quot; she said as 
she hurried over to her backpack. She opened it and fished out half a 
dozen rather questionable containers before was able to retrieve the 
portable medical kit she bought less than an hour ago. 

&quot;Can you give this to Sailor Mercury for me?&quot; she asked the nearest 
kid as she held the kit out to him. His eyes lit up at the thought of 
helping Sailor V and he eagerly did so, carrying it towards Mercury as 
if it was a major sports trophy. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mercury said as she knelt down and took the kit from him. 
She set the kit down on the ground and opened it, her eyes nearly 
falling out of her skull at what she saw inside. &quot;What kind of kit is 
this?&quot; she said, giving V a stunned look. 

V coughed lightly. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you about it later,&quot; she said. 

&quot;That should be an interesting conversation,&quot; Mercury muttered to 
herself as she quickly searched through the kit and came up with a 
small box of large band-aids, a piece of gauze, and a small bottle 
marked H2-O2. 

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; the little girl asked as she eyed the bottle warily. 

Mercury sighed at the question, knowing what was coming. &quot;This is just 
a little hydrogen peroxide to make sure that your scrape doesn&#39;t get 
infected. I know it stings a little,&quot; she said as the girl cringed, 
&quot;But just think of how much it will hurt if it does get infected. Now 
hold still while I scan it with my computer.&quot; 

The little girl blinked as Mercury passed her computer over the scrape 
and she saw things start to appear on Mercury&#39;s Virtual Visor. &quot;What&#39;s 
that thing doing?&quot; she asked as she pointed to the visor. 

&quot;My visor can act like a computer monitor so I can both see what my 
computer is telling me and see what&#39;s going on around me at the same 
time, instead of stopping to look at the screen,&quot; Mercury explained as 
she read the results. &quot;And since you can see how tiny the screen is, 
you can imagine how hard it is to stop and read when you&#39;re in the 
middle of a fight,&quot; she said as she handed her computer to the little 
girl. 

The girl&#39;s eyes went wide as she carefully took the compact computer 
from Mercury. &quot;It&#39;s so small and light,&quot; she said incrediously. With 
the sensor suite now pointed at Mercury, the display was changing to 
show her biological readings and the little girl was absolutely 
captivated as she watched the tiny words and symbols scroll across the 
screen. 

&quot;It has to be, since I can&#39;t carry a full-sized computer with me every 
time I want to go somewhere,&quot; Mercury explained soothingly as she 
quietly pried open the bottle of peroxide and dabbed the gauze in it. 
One of the lessons learned from Mother is always do the stuff they 
hate when they&#39;re preoccupied with something else, she thought to 
herself as she carefully wiped the gauze over the scrape. 

The little girl blinked as she felt a prickling sensation on her arm 
and looked down. &quot;Hey!&quot; she exclaimed, more out of surprise than 
anything. 

&quot;Does it hurt?&quot; Mercury inquired as she gently finished cleaning the 
scrape and opened the box of band-aids. 

The girl blinked as she realized that she wasn&#39;t in mortal agony. 
&quot;N-no, not really....&quot; she said, surprised that it really didn&#39;t hurt. 

&quot;I told you it only stings a little,&quot; Mercury replied with a smile as 
she peeled open a band-aid and gently placed it over the 
now-disinfected scrape. She smoothed the adhesive tabs down securely 
and looked up at her. &quot;There, that should do it.&quot; 

The little girl looked down at the new bandage before looking back up 
at Mercury, the smile spreading across her face like a sunbeam. &quot;Thank 
you!&quot; she exclaimed and gave Mercury a bone-crushing hug. Mercury was 
caught off-guard by the outburst of emotion and could only return the 
hug as best she could. 

&quot;Still having second thoughts, Doctor?&quot; Sailor V whispered in 
Mercury&#39;s ear, smiling at the sight. Mercury said nothing as the 
little girl finally released her and handed her computer back. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mercury said automatically. 

&quot;I don&#39;t mean to be a spoilsport here, kids, but Sailor Mercury and I 
have to be going. It&#39;s getting awfully close to dinnertime, and even 
Sailor Scouts need to eat,&quot; V said loudly enough for everyone to hear 
her. &quot;Besides, some of you have parents standing over there waiting 
for you.&quot; 

Mercury blinked and looked around, noticing for the first time the 
small group of adults standing together about twenty feet away. The 
children noticed this at exactly the same time and there was another 
brief stampede as all but three of them went running towards their 
parents, waving farewell to the Sailor Scouts in the process. 

The little girl smiled at Mercury and gave her another hug. &quot;I have to 
go. Thank you, Sailor Mercury!&quot; she said before she too turned around 
and made a mad-dash towards her patiently waiting mother. Mercury 
looked around and noticed that the two kids who remained were only 
waiting long enough to get Sailor Moon&#39;s autograph before they also 
headed towards Mom and Dad. 

&quot;I think you&#39;ve just made a friend for life,&quot; V observed quietly. 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Mercury said softly, her mind already occupied with trying 
to figure out the feelings the whole experience had caused. 

&quot;Is the coast clear?&quot; Sailor Moon asked with a weary expression as she 
walked towards V and Mercury. 

&quot;For today, at least. Now Mercury, tell me you didn&#39;t enjoy that,&quot; V 
said with another impish grin. 

&quot;Don&#39;t make me bite you in front of everybody,&quot; Mercury replied evenly 
with a not-quite-amused look. 

&quot;I told you she was stressed out to the point of wanting to bite 
someone,&quot; V said over her shoulder with a wink. Mercury looked behind 
V and blinked hard as she realized that Molly was still standing 
there. Uh oh, she thought, I forgot she was still with us.... 

&quot;Anyway, now that the rugrat brigade has gone elsewhere, it&#39;s time for 
me to make myself scarce again,&quot; V said as she knelt down and quickly 
repacked her backpack. 

&quot;Hold it, V,&quot; Mercury said with a slight edge to her voice. &quot;I want to 
ask you a few questions about that medical kit.&quot; 

&quot;Like...?&quot; V replied warily. 

&quot;Like what exactly it&#39;s supposed to be, where you got it, and how you 
paid for it,&quot; Mercury said. 

V raised a slender eyebrow. &quot;And when did you become my mother?&quot; 

Sailor Moon and Molly exchanged glances. &quot;I think now would be a good 
time for me to head back home,&quot; Molly told Sailor Moon quietly. 

&quot;You stay put for a few minutes,&quot; Mercury said over her shoulder 
without taking her eyes off of Sailor V. &quot;We still need to talk about 
a few things.&quot; 

V smiled sweetly. &quot;Oh, by all means, don&#39;t let me keep you from taking 
care of something of far greater importance than my shopping list. 
I&#39;ll just have to take a rain check and catch up with you two Sailor 
Scouts later,&quot; she said as she zipped the backpack closed and hefted 
it onto her shoulder. 

Mercury gave her a look that came dangerously close to melting a hole 
in her Virtual Visor. She closed the lid of the medical kit with 
enough force to dent the olive-green casing and wordlessly held it out 
to V. 

&quot;Thanks,&quot; V said as she took the kit from Mercury and flashed a smile 
at everyone. &quot;See ya later!&quot; she said as she started jogging down the 
path, disappearing from view as she turned a corner. 

&quot;You need to calm down,&quot; Sailor Moon said quietly to Mercury after a 
few moments of heavy silence. 

Mercury sighed quietly and muttered something toxic beneath her breath 
in the denizen language. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized as she deactivated 
her Virtual Visor and rubbed her temples. &quot;I just don&#39;t know how she 
manages to always get on my nerves like that.&quot; 

&quot;Knowing V, she&#39;d probably call it a skill,&quot; Sailor Moon ventured. 

The vampire grunted as she closed her eyes. &quot;The truly disturbing 
thing is that you&#39;re probably right,&quot; she said as she gave up trying 
to massage out her headache and let her hands fall to her sides. 

Molly shook her head. &quot;And you&#39;re sure you two are friends?&quot; 

Mercury opened her eyes and gave the redhead an odd look. &quot;Sailor V is 
a completely different person once she takes her mask off,&quot; she said, 
referring to the oversized Sailor V Transformation Glasses. &quot;I&#39;m not 
overly fond of V, but I&#39;m a close friend of the person beneath the 
attitude.&quot; 

&quot;I see,&quot; Molly said slowly, trying to figure out what was sending a 
subtle chill creeping down her spine. She summoned the same courage 
she used to force herself to speak to Reish&#39;id and drew in a slow 
breath. &quot;Sailor Mercury, can I talk to you for a few minutes?&quot; 

Molly almost whimpered as both Sailor Mercury and Sailor Moon seemed 
to stop breathing and looked at her. Sailor Moon&#39;s gaze was filled 
with unease and nervousness, but the carefully concealed emotions she 
saw in the depths of Mercury&#39;s steel-blue eyes and the intensity 
behind them is what truly bothered her. She knows, she thought 
suddenly, she knows I know.... 

&quot;Of course,&quot; Mercury replied evenly, doing her best to ignore the 
sudden formation of ice in her veins. &quot;What&#39;s on your mind?&quot; 

It seemed like an eternity passed before Molly&#39;s lips began to move as 
she spoke. &quot;I.... I think I know who you are....&quot; she said, her voice 
barely a whisper. Sailor Moon blinked at her words but Mercury 
continued to gaze at her with almost inhuman intensity, the steel-blue 
eyes seeming to bore into her very soul with each passing moment. 

&quot;I see....&quot; Mercury said slowly. &quot;And who do you think I am?&quot; 

&quot;Ami,&quot; Molly said softly, &quot;Ami Mizuno.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm, one of the students from Crossroads High School, I believe,&quot; 
Mercury said slowly, as if in deep thought. &quot;So what makes you think 
I&#39;m her?&quot; 

Molly took a deep breath and started to talk about information taken 
from several different events and weaved together to form her 
conclusion. The explanation took several minutes to finish and 
Mercury&#39;s vampiric gaze never wavered from her even once the entire 
time. 

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Mercury said when Molly fell silent. She briefly 
glanced at Sailor Moon and frowned slightly when she noticed that the 
blonde&#39;s eyes were wide with shock. She was about to whisper something 
to her when an idea suddenly blossomed in her mind with the force of a 
supernova. 

She blinked hard as she quickly considered her options and their 
potential repercussions before she decided on a course of action. I 
hope this works, she thought as she turned to face Sailor Moon. &quot;That 
sounds amazing, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; she said as an eerie gleam appeared in 
her vampiric eyes. You will nod your head and say nothing, she thought 
with all her willpower as she unleashed her hypnotic powers. 

Sailor Moon seemed to freeze in place for a moment, her blue eyes 
becoming even wider with shock before she slowly nodded to Mercury. 
Mercury turned to face Molly and took a deep breath. &quot;However, there 
is one serious flaw in your otherwise brilliant reasoning,&quot; she said 
slowly as she focused her hypnotic powers on Molly. 

Molly blinked as her breath seemed to catch in her throat briefly and 
her mind started to grow fuzzy. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; she managed to say as 
she looked into Mercury&#39;s eyes and was captivated by the faint gleam 
she saw in them. Such strange color eyes, she thought distantly. 

&quot;If I was Ami, I couldn&#39;t be in two places at once, now could I?&quot; 
Mercury said reasonably, keeping her voice soft and even. &quot;So if I&#39;m 
Ami, then who is that on the other side of the street over there?&quot; 

Molly blinked and turned to look, her eyes going wide as she saw a 
very familiar figure with short blue hair walking along the sidewalk, 
completely oblivious to the presence of the Sailor Scouts not more 
than forty or fifty yards away. 

Sailor Moon turned to look as well and nearly suffered a heart-attack. 
&quot;What?&quot; she managed to gasp before Mercury discreetly took hold of her 
elbow and lightly pinched a nerve. The resulting surge of pain forced 
her to fall silent as she continued to stare at the impossible visage 
of Ami walking along the sidewalk, disappearing from view after a few 
seconds. 

&quot;That was Ami, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Mercury asked neutrally as she struggled to 
keep an even expression and hoped that she wasn&#39;t obviously sweating. 

&quot;I.... I guess so,&quot; Molly said after a few seconds of silence. It took 
her another few seconds before she was able to shake off the residual 
effects of the hypnosis and turned to face Mercury. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re 
not Ami after all, Sailor Mercury.&quot; 

&quot;From what I know of Ami, she and I would probably get along quite 
well,&quot; Mercury said. She was still holding onto Sailor Moon&#39;s elbow 
but was no longer pinching her, a subtle reminder for the blonde to 
remain silent. &quot;But as we&#39;ve never met, that&#39;s just an educated 
guess.&quot; 

Molly blushed a medium shade of red. &quot;Guess I was wrong about you, 
Sailor Mercury. Sorry.&quot; 

Mercury just smiled. &quot;Just a case of mistaken identity, don&#39;t worry 
about it,&quot; she replied lightly. &quot;Well, seeing how you look well enough 
and all, I think it&#39;s time Sailor Moon and I got back home for 
dinner.&quot; 

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Molly said as she glanced at the horizon, trying to 
discern the time by the position of the setting sun. &quot;It&#39;s about what, 
getting close to six o&#39;clock by now?&quot; 

&quot;Five-thirty would be my guess, but that&#39;s close enough for anyone&#39;s 
stomach clock,&quot; Mercury said with a glance towards Sailor Moon. &quot;What 
do you think?&quot; 

Sailor Moon blinked hard as her mind snapped back into reality. 
&quot;Sorry, I was thinking about something. What did you say?&quot; she asked 
sheepishly. 

&quot;Thinking about dinner yet?&quot; Mercury said with a faint edge to her 
voice and the lightest of squeezes on the blonde&#39;s elbow. 

Sailor Moon blinked again at the subtle suggestion and smiled weakly. 
&quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot; 

Mercury gave Molly a knowing look. &quot;Well, if she&#39;s getting hungry, 
then you know it&#39;s time to go.&quot; 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Sailor Moon protested, more out of reflex than understanding. 

Molly giggled. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll catch you two some other time, I guess.&quot; 

&quot;Probably,&quot; Mercury replied. &quot;Let&#39;s just hope the next time won&#39;t be a 
cause for concern for anyone.&quot; 

&quot;No kidding,&quot; the redhead said with a serious nod. &quot;Take care,&quot; she 
said and started walking in the general direction of her house. 

Sailor Mercury waited until Molly was out of her sight before she 
sighed heavily and released Sailor Moon&#39;s elbow. &quot;I hope I never have 
to do that sort of thing again,&quot; she said softly, her voice laced with 
weariness. 

Sailor Moon whirled around to face her friend. &quot;How&#39;d you do that?&quot; 
she said, still quite rattled from seeing both Mercury and Ami at the 
same time. &quot;One moment you&#39;re standing right next to me, and then all 
of a sudden you&#39;re crossing the street, and then you&#39;re right back 
here again.&quot; 

&quot;It was a hypnotic illusion,&quot; Mercury explained. &quot;It&#39;s almost exactly 
like my invisibility, except that time I was making you see me when I 
really wasn&#39;t there instead of the other way around. It obviously 
worked, seeing how you both reacted like that.&quot; 

Sailor Moon gave her a slightly confused look. &quot;So how come you&#39;ve 
never told us about this trick before?&quot; 

&quot;Well.... to be honest, the idea just occurred to me five minutes ago 
and this is the first time I&#39;ve tried something like that,&quot; Mercury 
admitted with a faint blush of embarassment. &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure it would 
work since I couldn&#39;t see the illusion myself.&quot; 

The blonde blinked hard and stared at the distant sidewalk. &quot;But.... 
that looked so.... so real....&quot; she said slowly. 

Mercury just shrugged. &quot;Guess that means I did something right. Come 
on, we need to get out of here before someone else comes along and 
decides to ask for our autograph.&quot; 

Sailor Moon shivered lightly at the thought of signing any more 
autographs in the near-term future. &quot;And to think some people thrive 
on such things,&quot; she muttered to herself as they started walking 
towards a dense group of bushes. Once they were safely concealed from 
anyone who might have been watching them, they reversed their 
transformations and headed for the sidewalk in silence, Ami lost in 
introspective thought and Serena intent on arriving at her house in 
time for dinner. 

&quot;So I take it our identities are safe for now?&quot; Serena finally said 
they came to a halt at an intersection and waited for the light to 
change. 

Ami nodded. &quot;For now,&quot; she echoed. &quot;The only things that I can think 
of that would really screw up everything would be for Molly to either 
bump into Tolaris again and have him say something or to see him with 
one of us. She already knows what he looks like, so all she needs is 
to see a picture of him with a few friends and she&#39;ll start trying to 
put puzzle pieces together again. If she manages to put together 
another chain of events like she did with me, or even does so much as 
add another link or two to what she&#39;s already got, our &#39;secret 
identities&#39; could very well be blown wide open.&quot; 

Serena nodded in understanding as the traffic light changed and they 
started walking across the intersection. &quot;So what are you going to do, 
keep Tolaris locked inside the cathedral all the time?&quot; she teased. 

The vampire gave her a reproving look. &quot;You know I would never suggest 
such a thing. We just have to be more careful about what we do 
together in public, that&#39;s all.&quot; She blinked as something in her 
peripheral vision caught her attention and turned her head to look. 

Serena noticed Ami&#39;s gaze shifting suddenly and also turned to look, 
her blue eyes widening slightly at what she saw. &quot;Hey, isn&#39;t that your 
mom&#39;s car parked over there?&quot; 

&quot;Do you know anyone else with an electric-blue Porsche in this city?&quot; 
Ami answered with a slight frown. She couldn&#39;t see the licence plate 
from where she was standing, but she would have bet a considerable sum 
of money that it was indeed her mother&#39;s car. Odd, she thought to 
herself, she shouldn&#39;t be getting home until close to midnight. 
Unless.... 

&quot;I&#39;ll catch you later, Serena,&quot; she said abruptly as she made a 
decision and started walking towards the car. Her mind was already 
becoming preoccupied with trying to figure out why her mother wasn&#39;t 
working right now and didn&#39;t hear Serena&#39;s slightly confused 
farewells. 

Ami was only a dozen feet away from the car when the slender figure of 
her mother stepped out of a small corner store with a slightly harried 
look on her otherwise stunning features and carrying a large grocery 
bag. She wasn&#39;t aware of Ami&#39;s approach until she had stashed the bag 
in the trunk and happened to look up at the sound of footsteps. 

&quot;Hello, Ami,&quot; Doctor Amelia Anderson said, only mildly surprised to 
find her daughter standing in front of her instead at home studying in 
her room. 

&quot;Hi, Mom,&quot; Ami replied as she gave her mother a hug. The hug only 
lasted a brief moment as the overwhelming smell of medical-strength 
antiseptic reached Ami&#39;s keen nose. She quickly took a step back, 
wrinking her nose as the smell made her eyes start to water. 

&quot;I know, it is rather strong,&quot; Dr. Anderson said apologetically before 
Ami could say anything. &quot;There was a major accident last night and 
we&#39;re just now finishing up the post-ops. I figured that since they 
were letting me go, I&#39;d finish scrubbing off the antiseptic at home.&quot; 

Ami nodded and tried not to imagine what her mother had just gone 
through. &quot;Is that why you&#39;re headed home so early?&quot; she asked as she 
walked to the other side of the car and opened the door. 

Her mother got in the car and unlocked the passenger side door with a 
tap on the armrest. It wasn&#39;t until Ami had sat down, closed the door, 
and buckled her seatbelt that she noticed the odd look her mother was 
giving her. &quot;What?&quot; she asked cautiously. 

&quot;Early? Ami, I haven&#39;t been able to leave the hospital since I checked 
in for work yesterday morning,&quot; Dr. Anderson said, the strain of 
working nonstop for so long finally starting to show on her face. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been up to my elbows in work for the past twenty-eight hours.&quot; 

Ami blinked incredulously as her mother closed the door and started 
the ignition. The well-maintained Porsche&#39;s V-6 engine immediately 
caught on the first revolution and started purring softly, eliciting 
the faintest suggestion of a smile on the usually mild-mannered 
doctor&#39;s face. The car was her only concession to lavish spending and 
her habit of striving to always keep it in near-perfect operating 
condition sometimes bordered on the fanatical. Ami had often suspected 
that her mother enjoyed driving the Porsche just a little bit too 
much, but had no real complaints as the good doctor always drove with 
the utmost care and caution. 

Her mother&#39;s words repeated themselves in her mind and Ami struggled 
to repress a shiver. Her mother was a highly-skilled surgeon and was 
more often than not called upon to work on emergency trauma cases. The 
hospital wouldn&#39;t have kept her on call for such an extended period of 
time unless her skills had been direly needed. That being the case, 
Ami thought grimly, she very well might have been up to her elbows in 
surgery. Literally. The image that sprang to her mind wasn&#39;t a pretty 
one and she had to repress another shiver. 

I can think of worse jobs, she thought as she cast a concerned glance 
at her mother. Dr. Anderson&#39;s dark blue hair was still securely 
wrapped up in her usually tight bun, but Ami noticed a sizable number 
of errant strands of hair that had managed to work themselves free, a 
sign of stress and fatigue that only those close to the doctor could 
discern. The few lines of age that had engraved themselves on her 
stern yet alluring features over the years were more sharply 
pronounced than usual, yet another barely-noticable indication of the 
physical burden on her. 

Ami sighed quietly to herself, not able to completely understand the 
sort of weight her mother carried on her shoulders on a day-to-day 
basis. She knew that not being able to understand was partly a good 
thing, as her mother said on occasion that no human being should have 
to see what she sometimes sees on a really bad night, but the 
frustration of not being able to fully understand sometimes wore on 
her soul as well. 

&quot;Something on your mind?&quot; her mother asked gently as she buckled her 
seat belt and cast a curious glance at her daughter. 

Ami blinked as her mind refocused itself on the surrounding reality. 
&quot;I was just worried about you having to drive given how tired you 
are,&quot; she said carefully. She blinked again and fought the urge to 
cringe as her mother gave her a decidedly cool look in response. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, dear,&quot; Dr. Anderson said evenly without a hint of 
reproach in her voice. She didn&#39;t need to say anything else or to use 
any other tone to convey her meaning as her look communicated 
everything that needed to be said. 

Ami merely glanced away, knowing that she wasn&#39;t the only one to ever 
be given &#39;that look&#39; by her mother. The look could have many possible 
meanings, although in this case Ami took it to read, &quot;Your concern is 
touching, but I know quite well what I&#39;m doing, thank you very much.&quot; 

&quot;Unless, of course, you happen to be suggesting that you would prefer 
to drive home,&quot; she continued, a note of faint humor creeping into her 
voice. 

This time Ami couldn&#39;t stop herself from cringing at her mother&#39;s 
words, despite the fact that she knew that her mother was simply 
teasing her. They were both aware that Ami had never driven a car 
before, let alone sat behind the wheel of one with a manual 
transmission. 

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Ami replied, then cautiously added, &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t 
mind learning one of these months.&quot; She blinked in surprise when her 
words didn&#39;t draw another cool look from her mother at the suggestion 
of trying to learn how to drive on her Porsche. The look she got in 
its place was one of careful consideration. Maybe, just maybe.... she 
thought as the tiniest spark of hope ignited deep inside her heart. &quot;I 
am sixteen, after all,&quot; she ventured. 

She suddenly had to fight the urge to cringe once more as her mother 
gave her the look again, this one seeming to say, &quot;As if I would 
forget the age of my only daughter.&quot; The look unexpectedly softened 
after a few moments as her mother sighed quietly to herself, turning 
her attention out towards the evening traffic on the street. 

&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; she said softly, almost sadly, as she shifted the car 
into gear and smoothly drove into the flow of traffic. 

Ami blinked at the sudden change in her mother&#39;s mood. Now that was 
odd, she thought as she glanced at her out of the corner of her eye. 
Maybe she&#39;s even more tired than I thought. Ami gave the matter a few 
more moments of thought before she shoved it onto one of the many 
&#39;back burners&#39; in her mind before she turned her attention out the 
window and let her mind drift off to other topics. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Time and spaced seemed to twist inward on itself in an unusually 
graphic display of quasi-dimensional energy for a brief moment before 
unfolding back into its usual shape, leaving behind a rather odd 
assortment of individuals. 

&quot;And I thought Susan&#39;s keep was a creepy place to visit,&quot; Alex 
observed as she studied at the dark landscape surrounding her. &quot;Either 
someone needs to find the lightswitch for the sun, or I need to get 
out of here.&quot; 

&quot;I assure you if such a switch is to be found, it would have been 
turned on a very, very long time ago,&quot; Mephisto replied with a raised 
eyebrow as he scanned the area for other life-forms. He blinked as 
something moved in his peripheral vision and he foused on it. 
&quot;Michelle, don&#39;t move,&quot; he said very quietly. 

Michelle blinked as she froze, her eyes darting about as she searched 
for whatever it was that he had seen. &quot;W-what?&quot; she said nervously. 
She was about to say more when the darkness started to ripple a few 
feet away from her and a mishappen creature became visible. 

&quot;Erk-burgle?&quot; it blubbered at her, staring at her with beady eyes. 

Michelle&#39;s reply was to leap back into Alex&#39;s arms, screaming at the 
top of her lungs. The creature promptly made a shrill cry of its own 
and ran away as fast as it could, clearly terrified of the unexpected 
visitors. 

&quot;I think it&#39;s gone, love, so you can calm down now,&quot; Alex said as she 
gently hugged an extremely upset Michelle. &quot;To be honest, I&#39;m not sure 
who scared who more.&quot; 

&quot;So much for first contact,&quot; Susan mused as she watched the retreating 
creature. She glanced towards Michelle and blinked. &quot;I think you can 
let go of Myst now,&quot; said evenly. 

Michelle blinked and looked down, quickly releasing her death-grip on 
the Shinma. Myst made an odd coughing noise as she jumped down onto 
the ground, carefully stretching out her legs and muttering somewhat 
unkind things beneath her breath. 

&quot;Are you okay, Myst?&quot; Mephisto inquired gently as he searched around 
for the marker he imprinted after his visit to the Moon Kingdom. 

&quot;Next time I find a living soul, I&#39;m going to eat it instead,&quot; the cat 
said sourly as she continued to stretch. 

&quot;Human souls don&#39;t taste nearly as good as you would imagine,&quot; Susan 
said with a faint smile on her lips. 

&quot;Thanks, Sue, we really appreciate hearing that,&quot; Alex muttered darkly 
to herself, still comforting Michelle after her close encounter with 
the unknown. 

&quot;Here it is,&quot; Mephisto said as he located the marker. He glanced 
around before he carefully probed the fabric of space-time, carefully 
feeling for the tiny seam that, when torn open, would create a 
wormhole to the Moon Kingdom. 

&quot;Wait,&quot; Susan said suddenly, her eyes narrowing. She carefully looked 
around them before sniffing the air. &quot;Do you smell something?&quot; 

Mephisto frowned and tested the air. &quot;I don&#39;t smell anything.&quot; 

&quot;I do,&quot; Myst said with a slight edge to her voice, her whiskers 
twitching violently. &quot;Smells like.... tengu.&quot; 

Susan grunted softly as she exchanged concerned glances with Mephisto. 
&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Alex said warily. &quot;This tengu thing we can&#39;t smell but 
you and Myst can is bad news, right?&quot; 

&quot;Decidedly,&quot; the succubus replied. &quot;As soon as the gate is open, I 
want you and Michelle through it, no matter what starts to happen.&quot; 

&quot;Wait, Susan, what....&quot; Michelle started to say. 

Susan glared at them over her shoulder. &quot;No arguments,&quot; she said in a 
voice laced with steel. She waited until she got a subdued nod from 
Michelle before she turned her attention back out towards the 
darkness, small ripples of bright-red energy starting to form on her 
arms. 

Mephisto glanced at Susan&#39;s back in concern for a moment before he 
turned his attention to the seam in the fabric of space-time. He 
closed his eyes and concentrated, a wave of pure energy forming around 
him as a spike of quantum energy began to form. The spike began to 
glow as more power was fed into it until it was almost strong enough 
to pierce the fabric of space-time. 

Myst&#39;s head snapped around as movement caught her eye. &quot;Here they 
come!&quot; she yelled as a horde of creatures suddenly became visible a 
short distance away and began to charge forward, eager to tap into the 
unknown but obviously powerful source of energy. 

Susan&#39;s eyes began to glow as she raised her hands towards the 
onrushing horde, her hands balling into fists. &quot;Get them out of here!&quot; 
she snapped as the ripples of energy on her arms quickly coalesced 
into a pair of bright-red spheres on her fists. With a snarl, she 
released the spheres and sent them blazing towards the tengu mob like 
miniature comets. 

Mephisto thrust the quantum spike forward as hard as he could, 
catching the seam head-on and neatly ripping it open. The tear widened 
instantly, creating a tremendous whirling maelstrom of energy that 
nearly blinded everyone with it&#39;s radiance. Without hesitation, 
Mephisto grabbed Alex by the arm and literally threw her into the 
vortex. 

&quot;GO!&quot; he roared at Michelle as he turned around and unleashed a stream 
of sparks towards the tengu. Michelle didn&#39;t pause to look as she 
leapt into the maelstrom and disappeared. Myst started to change her 
shape in preparation of a battle when Susan grabbed her by the scruff 
of her neck and threw her into the vortex, her free hand still firing 
energy balls at the tengu. 

The first two energy balls had already reached the leading edge of the 
mob and was wreaking absolute havoc, literally exploding the flesh of 
those tengu unfortunate enough to be in the way. The creatures split 
up and began to scatter, making themselves harder targets while still 
drawing closer to the wormhole. 

&quot;I&#39;ll handle them, get out of here!&quot; Mephisto yelled as he let loose 
with another stream of sparks. 

&quot;I&#39;m not leaving you behind!&quot; the succubus yelled back as she began to 
edge towards the vortex, still blasting the demons with her unholy 
energy. 

&quot;I will catch up with you later, trust me,&quot; the Shinma said as he 
broke off his attack and grabbed Susan by the wrist. &quot;Take care of 
Alex for me,&quot; he said as he heaved her into the wormhole and collapsed 
it behind her. 

An energy wave exploded around him as the fabric of space-time 
resealed itself and everything suddenly became disturbingly quiet. He 
turned around and studied the group encircling him, the tengu confused 
by the sudden loss of the source of energy and unsure what to do next. 

&quot;Forty against one, is it?&quot; Mephisto said slowly as he glanced around. 
He began to laugh quietly to himself, a low-pitched and decidedly 
dangerous sound as his form began to expand and divide. &quot;Let&#39;s see how 
you vermin handle a real Shinma,&quot; he said as he unleashed his 
powers.... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The air, which for the past thousand years had remained undisturbed, 
was suddenly agitated as a whirling vortex of energy irised open and a 
humanoid figure was flung out, cursing loudly as she landed hard on 
the ashy dirt. 

&quot;Of all the....&quot; Alex began to say before another figure emerged from 
the maelstrom. The edge of the wormhole was several inches above the 
ground and she stumbled as she exited, crashing into Alex and drawing 
another burst of profanity. 

&quot;Goddamn it, get off my.... Mich! Are you alright?&quot; the blonde asked 
as she struggled to get out from under Michelle&#39;s presently unwelcome 
weight. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Michelle said, somewhat disoriented by the brief time 
spent travelling through the wormhole. 

&quot;You landed on me, that&#39;s what,&quot; Alex grunted. &quot;I love you dearly, but 
you need to get off of me right now. Where&#39;s everyone else?&quot; 

Michelle was about to reply when Myst emerged from the vortex, not in 
the least bit in control of her trajectory. She slammed into 
Michelle&#39;s shoulder, knocking her off-balance and causing her to fall 
back down on the unfortunate blonde. 

The burst of profanity lasted for several seconds, during which 
Michelle&#39;s complexion turned a vivid shade of red and Myst was able to 
regain her sense of direction, including which way was down. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think even Susan&#39;s done that,&quot; Michelle ventured as she hastily moved 
herself off of Alex&#39;s foot and moved a safe distance away from the 
blonde&#39;s explosive temper. 

&quot;Watch out!&quot; Myst hissed as she glanced at the swirling vortex and 
curled up into a tiny ball. Alex barely had time to glance up before 
she saw a large winged shadow looming over her as it emerged from the 
wormhole. The blonde merely grunted and held her arms out in a vain 
attempt to prevent further damage from being inflicted on her already 
battered and bruised body. 

Alex somehow managed to catch Susan without breaking anything, despite 
the jarring impact of their collision. Behind them, the wormhole 
suddenly collapsed in on itself and vanished, leaving the four of them 
alone on what appeared to be a barren and lifeless world. 

Susan quickly reoriented herself and moved off of Alex. &quot;Thank you, 
you broke my fall perfectly,&quot; she said as she stood up and tried to 
help the blonde to her feet. 

&quot;I&#39;ll break something else if you don&#39;t shut up,&quot; Alex growled as she 
did her best to retain her balance and almost failed. 

Michelle glanced at the spot where the wormhole was and frowned. &quot;Wait 
a minute, where&#39;s Mephisto?&quot; 

The succubus glanced at the empty air and muttered something beneath 
her breath. &quot;Apparently he closed the wormhole behind me in an attempt 
to keep anything from following us here. He said that he would catch 
up with us at a later time.&quot; She sighed quietly to herself and decided 
that it would be best not to repeat what else he had told her, at 
least for the present. 

&quot;Myst, are you okay?&quot; Michelle asked as she knelt down in the dust to 
stroke the kitten&#39;s gray fur. 

&quot;What.... what is that?&quot; Myst asked as she stared up into the sky, her 
red eyes opened wide in wonder. 

Alex glanced up in the direction the Shinma was staring at and 
whistled softly. &quot;That&#39;s the planet Earth,&quot; she said as she studied 
the beautiful orb hanging in the sky. She glanced at the dark side of 
the planet and blinked. &quot;Hey, is it just me, or are there lights on 
the dark side?&quot; 

Susan barely glanced at the planet before studying the barren 
landscape around them. &quot;You have to remember that a thousand years has 
passed since you last saw the planet. If memory serves, their calendar 
should be in the late 1900&#39;s and they should possess a startling array 
of technology. What you see are their cities at night, lit up by 
electric lights.&quot; 

&quot;Umm, I take it those are different than the glowstones we use?&quot; 
Michelle asked hesitantly as she looked around. &quot;And where are we?&quot; 

&quot;Glowstones don&#39;t work on Earth, love,&quot; Alex said. &quot;At least, they 
didn&#39;t last time I tried taking one there.&quot; 

&quot;They still don&#39;t,&quot; Susan said absently as she looked around. &quot;If 
those ruins are what I think they are, we&#39;re probably at the extreme 
southern edge of the Shield.&quot; 

Michelle blinked as she looked around the barren landscape. &quot;What 
ruins?&quot; 

Susan gave her a curious look. &quot;Those ruins,&quot; she said, pointing at an 
apparently empty section of lunar terrain. 

&quot;Umm, Sue?&quot; Alex said slowly. &quot;I don&#39;t see anything over there except 
a buttload of dust and maybe a small pebble.&quot; 

Myst made a strange noise. &quot;You can&#39;t see those huge columns of 
marble?&quot; she asked slowly, wondering if a joke was trying to be made. 

Susan&#39;s wings started to twitch as she turned around to stare at the 
image she was seeing. After a few moments of silence, she closed her 
eyes and turned her concentration inward. Her wings flexed once before 
they were folded flat and abosorbed into the scars on her back. &quot;So 
that&#39;s it,&quot; she said when she opened her eyes and saw the world with 
her human vision. 

&quot;We&#39;re waiting, Sue,&quot; Alex muttered, more to herself than to anyone. 

Susan shot her a reproving glance. &quot;I think the Screen is still active 
around the Kingdom, but the bubble generator is no longer functional.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds bad,&quot; Alex commented. &quot;Now you wanna explain that in small 
words so the rest of us can understand it?&quot; 

&quot;I thought the Screen was a ward surrounding the Kingdom that makes it 
invisible to anything standing outside the Shield,&quot; Michelle said 
carefully. 

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Susan said. &quot;However, the Screen also cloaks anything 
that is inside it. In order for the people inside the Shield to see 
everything around them, a special generator was designed to nullify 
the cloaking effect within a certain radius, creating a &#39;bubble&#39; of 
visibility.&quot; 

Alex shook her head slowly. &quot;Oh, yeah, I remember now.... You 
explained that to Prince Darian once when he asked why he couldn&#39;t see 
the Moon Kingdom from his palace on Earth.&quot; 

Susan tilted her head to one side. &quot;Alex, you amaze me sometimes,&quot; she 
teased with a faint smile. &quot;I always thought you had been too busy 
playing with the inside of Neptune&#39;s skirt to be paying attention to 
anything I might have said then.&quot; 

Alex and Michelle exchanged glances before they both blushed a deep 
shade of red. &quot;Umm.... we didn&#39;t think anyone would notice....&quot; the 
blonde mumbled. 

&quot;Can the bubble generator be fixed?&quot; Michelle asked. 

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Susan replied. 

&quot;I have a question,&quot; Myst said cautiously. &quot;What is this shield you 
are talking about?&quot; 

&quot;Lecture mode now in effect,&quot; Alex muttered to herself. 

Susan ignored the comment. &quot;It is a barrier designed to keep the 
vacuum of space out and a breathable atmosphere inside the boundaries 
of the Kingdom,&quot; she explained. &quot;The Shield works only on the air, so 
objects may pass freely in and out of it. However, as there is a total 
vacuum beyond the Shield, one must be careful not to get near it 
without protective gear.&quot; 

&quot;And how close are we to the wrong side of the Shield?&quot; Alex asked 
warily. 

Susan paused to think for a moment before she resumed her demonic 
form, looking around the barren landscape with inhuman eyes that could 
see beyond the effects of the Screen. &quot;Why don&#39;t we start walking 
towards the Palace?&quot; she suggested gently as she studied something 
behind the group. 

&quot;How close, Sue?&quot; the blonde said wearily. 

The succubus shrugged. &quot;I&#39;d say about seven feet behind you.&quot; 

&quot;Time to go,&quot; Alex replied hastily. &quot;C&#39;mon, love, grab the kitty and 
let&#39;s get moving.&quot; 

Michelle carefully picked up Myst and held her in her arms as the 
group began walking. &quot;How much of a walk do we have ahead of us?&quot; she 
asked as she looked around the area. 

&quot;Bladder&#39;s getting to you too, eh?&quot; Alex said with a wry grin. 

&quot;Starting to,&quot; Michelle replied. &quot;I can wait, though.&quot; 

&quot;Myst....&quot; Susan said slowly as an idea hit her. &quot;Can you warp space 
around us like Mephisto did?&quot; 

The Shinma nodded. &quot;Yes, but you&#39;ll have to tell me exactly where 
we&#39;re going or I won&#39;t be able to do it.&quot; 

Susan gestured. &quot;See that building there, the one on the hill?&quot; 

&quot;What hill?&quot; the blonde muttered to herself. 

&quot;That&#39;s where you want to go?&quot; Myst inquired. 

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s the Royal Palace,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;At least, that&#39;s what 
it was a thousand years ago.&quot; 

Myst said nothing as she studied the ruins of the palace, a mirage 
that was only partially visible to her inhuman vision. She imagined 
tendrils of energy leaving her body to cross the vast distance between 
her and the palace, twisting and folding space as they went. When the 
two points were bridged by the energy she wrapped space-time around 
them and reversed the orientation of the bridge, causing them to cease 
to exist at the first point and to resume existing at the second 
point. 

&quot;Bizarre,&quot; Alex said as space-time unwrapped itself and the universe 
began to make sense once more. 

&quot;Problem?&quot; Susan inquired. 

&quot;Nah, just felt like down was in sixteen different directions for 
brief moment,&quot; the blonde explained. &quot;And don&#39;t even get me started on 
which way up felt like.&quot; 

Michelle looked around and blinked. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s that?&quot; she said as 
she pointed towards a building that kept fading in and out of view 
like a ghost. 

&quot;That, I believe, is where the bubble generator is housed,&quot; Susan 
replied as she started walking towards it. &quot;You three stay here. Oh, 
and don&#39;t move around too much or you&#39;ll disturb the corpses.&quot; 

Alex blinked hard. &quot;Corpses?&quot; she said as she glanced down at her 
feet. &quot;Sue, I don&#39;t see anything....&quot; 

&quot;Which is why you shouldn&#39;t move,&quot; the succubus replied as she 
gingerly tried to open the stone door. The door resisted for a moment 
before crumbling into a cloud of dust that flickered in and out of 
view. &quot;Not what I had in mind, but it&#39;ll do,&quot; she mused as she stepped 
into the doorway and into the small stairwell. 

Most of the glowstones had failed over time, but a few were still able 
to cast a dim glow, providing just enough light. How long has it been 
since I was last down here? she mused as she descended further and 
further into the lowest levels of the Royal Palace. Now that I think 
about it, I think I&#39;ve only been down here that one time.... 

&lt;What are you doing down here?&gt; the voice from the distant past said, 
&lt;You know this area is off-limits for a good reason.&gt; 

Susan looked up, a faint smile touching her lips. &quot;Lady Saturn,&quot; she 
said very softly as she came to the bottom of the stairs and entered 
the chamber that housed the bubble generator. She was alone, but in 
her mind&#39;s eye she saw the familiar figure of her childhood mentor 
following her down the ancient staircase, chastising her for entering 
the forbidden room. 

The generator was composed of several crystals surrounding a decidedly 
massive black crystal, each suspended in mid-air by magnetic fields 
when it was operating. Lasers emitted by the surrounding machinery 
were refracted through each of the smaller crystals and focused 
together in the large one to create a unique energy field that 
disrupted the cloaking effect of the Screen within a certain radius. 

&lt;I suppose you&#39;re down here for a reason?&gt; Lady Saturn said as she 
entered the chamber, still wearing her ballroom gown. 

&quot;I just wanted to see the generator,&quot; Susan said, repeating the words 
she had uttered more than fifteen hundred years ago as she surveyed 
the room. Even though everything was covered in a thin layer of dust 
and the machinery hadn&#39;t been touched by a living hand in a thousand 
years, virtually all of the various consoles and displays still 
functioned. 

She approached the master console and immediately noticed a very weak 
but still readable blinking message on the panel. Code 72, she thought 
as she searched her memory for what it meant. Generator off-line, 
safeguards still intact, cause unknown. Which means it can be 
repaired, she thought with a small sigh of relief. 

&lt;And wanted to see how it works, I would imagine,&gt; Saturn replied with 
a hint of amusement in her jet-black eyes. &lt;I swear, between your 
curiosity and Anna&#39;s penchant for tinkering with mechanics, I&#39;m amazed 
anything still works around here.&gt; 

&quot;I wasn&#39;t going to touch it,&quot; Susan protested. &quot;I just wanted to know 
how it works in case I have to fix it some day.&quot; She looked up at the 
network of crystals and frowned. When the magnetic fields had 
collapsed, the crystals had all settled down into special housings 
designed to hold them while the generator was being worked on. While 
the main crystal and most of the other crystals appeared to be normal, 
one of the smaller crystals was lying at a strange angle inside its 
housing. 

A delicate eyebrow was raised in reply. &lt;And what makes you think that 
you&#39;d be the one to repair it if something should go wrong?&gt; 

Susan sighed. &quot;I want to learn, just in case. I&#39;ll be around for quite 
some time as I&#39;m not human like you or Mother,&quot; she said softly, 
knowing that nothing more needed to be said. She moved away from the 
console and over to the machinery to get a better look at the tilted 
crystal. She studied it for a moment before she carefully tried to 
remove it from the housing. 

The crystal was already badly fragmented and her light touch caused it 
to further shatter with a muted crack, turning into a mass of tiny 
shards of useless crystal in her hand. So this is the problem, she 
mused as she briefly studied the slivers of crystal before she dumped 
them into a pile on the floor and started to pick the remaining shards 
out of the housing. 

Lady Saturn sighed quietly to herself as she placed her hand over her 
abdomen, trying to feel the life inside her that was not even six 
weeks old. &lt;Very well, Susan,&gt; she said quietly and began to explain 
everything she knew about the bubble generator. 

Susan checked the remaining crystals as the voice continued to speak 
in the depths of her memory, pointing out this and that and explaining 
what each one did. She had only been seventeen at the time, still 
mastering her skills as a Sailor Scout and trying to cope with her 
demonic heritage, and was rather awed by the power of the bubble 
generator technology. She had long ago lost that sense of awe, but 
still marveled that such a device could function for so long with only 
the most superficial maintenance requirements. 

&quot;So what happens if a crystal should break?&quot; she asked in the past 
while she finished her checks of the other crystals in the present. 

&lt;If one should break when the generator is running, the safeguards 
will immediately shut it down and set off more than a few alarms in 
the Palace. However, there will still be enough energy for the bubble 
to remain intact for a few hours before collapsing, giving us enough 
time to either regenerate the crystal or replace it before the Screen 
makes it impossible to see.&gt; 

&quot;So where are the replacement crystals?&quot; 

&lt;Here,&gt; Saturn said as she gestured to a large cabinet. Susan walked 
over to the cabinet and tried to open it, frowning as she discovered 
it was locked. &quot;You never mentioned it was locked, Jeanne,&quot; she 
muttered to herself as the memory of the Lady Saturn returned to the 
depths of her subconscious mind. Well.... she thought as she 
considered her options, I can&#39;t blast it open without taking the 
chance of breaking the replacements, and I don&#39;t have the first clue 
where the key might be, so.... 

She got a solid grip on the cabinet handle, placed one foot against 
the wall for stability, and heaved with all her demonic strength. The 
lock, solid as it once was a thousand years ago, resisted for a total 
of two seconds before ripping free from its housing, taking a good 
portion of the cabinet door with it and throwing Susan off-balance in 
the process. 

The only thing that saved her from a very ungraceful and probably 
painful encounter with the floor was her wings, which she furiously 
began flapping as soon as she lost her balance. Although she couldn&#39;t 
fly because her heritage had given her smaller wings than was normal 
for a succubus, she still had sufficient aerodynamic power to provide 
a forward force strong enough to stabilize her balance until she could 
get both feet firmly on the ground. 

Scale of one to ten, that deserves a three, she thought sourly to 
herself as she dropped the remains of the cabinet door onto the floor 
and looked inside the now-open cabinet. &quot;This should do nicely,&quot; she 
said to herself as she carefully extracted a replacement crystal and 
held it up to get a good look at it in the dim light. 

Sighing quietly to herself, she reviewed the procedure for activating 
the dormant generator as she gently set the crystal down in the vacant 
housing, making sure it fit properly. Once she was sure that the 
crystal wasn&#39;t going to fracture on her again, she returned to the 
main console and studied the display. Satisfied that nothing else was 
obviously wrong, she opened the main circuit panel, pressed the 
sequence of buttons that would reset the generator, and toggled the 
reset switch. 

She paused as nothing happened. She was about to try the restart 
command again when she felt the hair on her arms start to tingle, a 
sign that a strong magnetic field was building up. When the 
subharmonic hum reached her ears, a small smile formed at the corners 
of her mouth. &quot;Thank you, Jeanne,&quot; she said quietly as a cloud of dust 
suddenly sprung up around the generator as the magnetic fields came 
on-line, entrapping the crystals in an invisible web of energy and 
causing them to rise up into the air. 

A loud klaxon went off and she jumped, more than slightly startled by 
the sound. She had just begun to worry about what it could mean when 
the laser arrays powered up and sent their focused beams of light into 
the hearts of the smaller crystals. The crystals began to resonate for 
a few moments, adding a curious hum to the chamber, before they 
started to glow and refract the laser light into the center crystal. 

Susan glanced down at the console and tried to read the display. Even 
though the text was very dim, she could tell that everything was 
working just fine, despite the machinery&#39;s age and condition. A small 
clock in the corner of the display was counting down the time 
remaining until the generator was fully active and the &#39;bubble&#39; could 
be created. 

&quot;I think that should do it,&quot; she said softly to herself and left the 
chamber, thinking pretty much the same dark thoughts about the 
steepness of the staircase as she had thought the first time she had 
to climb them. 

&quot;Well?&quot; Alex demanded as Susan stepped out of the only 
partially-visible building. &quot;Can it be fixed or what?&quot; 

Susan merely smiled, waited until just the right moment, and snapped 
her fingers. An invisible shockwave blasted out from the depths of the 
building, pushing the cloaking effects of the Screen away like dirt 
riding the crest of a tidal wave. 

&quot;Daaaaaaaaammmmmmnnnn,&quot; the blonde breathed softly as the Moon Kingdom 
became visible to her human eyes. &quot;What the hell happened?&quot; 

Nothing had been left intact. Most of the buildings had been reduced 
to rubble in the battle, and the passage of a thousand years of time 
only made the decay worse. The great columns of marble standing at the 
perimeter of the Kingdom were now little more than stumps, most of the 
material lying broken and scattered across the landscape. Most of the 
Royal Palace had been destroyed, but oddly enough the front portion 
and the courtyard had been spared the wrath of destruction. 

Michelle glanced down momentarily to try to calm herself when she 
spotted a decayed skeleton wearing a suit of armor and holding a sword 
in its bony hand. &quot;ALEX!&quot; she yelped as she stumbled back and nearly 
knocked Susan over. 

&quot;Mich, what? Oh boy....&quot; Alex said as she saw the source of her 
lover&#39;s sudden panic-attack. &quot;Umm, Susan?&quot; 

&quot;I told you there were corpses around,&quot; Susan said as she knelt down 
to examine the remains. &quot;Judging by the armor, I&#39;d say she was a foot 
soldier. However, I don&#39;t think she died in battle.&quot; 

Alex took a deep breath as she sought to calm both herself and 
Michelle. &quot;We don&#39;t need a graphic description, Sue.&quot; 

Susan nodded and stood up, looking for another corpse to examine. She 
found one several feet away, the tattered remains of what once might 
have been a suit hanging on the skeleton. &quot;As I thought. These two 
didn&#39;t die from wounds in battle.... they died when the Shield 
collapsed.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Alex and Michelle said simultaneously. 

&quot;Notice how dry and stale the air is,&quot; Susan said. &quot;Had the atmosphere 
been intact these past thousand years, all the decaying bodies would 
have had a tremendous effect on what the air would smell like right 
now. My guess is that the Shield collapsed shortly after the attack 
and the air was dispersed into the void of space.&quot; 

&quot;So why are we still able to breathe?&quot; Alex asked. &quot;Not that I&#39;m 
filing a complaint, mind you, I&#39;m just asking,&quot; she added hastily. 

The succubus shrugged. &quot;I have no idea right now,&quot; she replied. &quot;But I 
think that&#39;s a secondary concern right now, as we have more important 
matters to attend to.&quot; 

Alex grunted to herself. &quot;Like finding a place to take a piss.&quot; 

Susan merely shook her head. &quot;Of course, Alex. I think there was an 
intact toilet downstairs,&quot; she said as she pointed to the stairwell 
leading down to the bubble generator. &quot;As for me, I need to find the 
place where we died so I can recover what&#39;s left of my staff.&quot; 

&quot;Great idea,&quot; the blonde said as she dashed towards the staircase. 
&quot;I&#39;ll catch up with you in a bit.&quot; 

Myst jumped out of Michelle&#39;s arms and followed Susan. &quot;I think I&#39;ll 
walk this time,&quot; she muttered to herself, drawing a faint smile from 
Susan. 

&quot;Wait, what about me?&quot; Michelle said nervously as she glanced around 
at her surroundings, cringing again at the sight of the fallen 
soldier&#39;s corpse. 

&quot;Wait for Alex to finish up, then head towards the Market Square,&quot; 
Susan replied as she and Myst started walking, disappearing behind a 
ruined building after a few seconds. 

Michelle looked around and sighed, the sudden desolation making her 
unease all the more worse. &quot;C&#39;mon, Alex, hurry up,&quot; she pleaded softly 
as she turned around and glanced at the ruins of the Palace behind 
her. 

&lt;In the Palace....&gt; 

She blinked as the thought intruded into her mind, as if it had come 
from someone other than her. Hmm? she thought. 

&lt;Retrieve the broach....&gt; 

She suddenly became rigid as the mysterious mind expanded outward and 
took control of her body. Her aquamarine eyes misted over until they 
were a deep shade of red, glowing faintly in the light reflected by 
the Earth. 

&quot;The Queen&#39;s broach....&quot; she whispered as she moved quickly towards 
the ruins of the Palance. She paused to get her bearings and set off 
towards the lower levels, moving with the ease of one who knew her way 
around. 

While most of the royal treasures were stored in the vault buried deep 
beneath the crypts at the northwestern edge of the Kingdom, a few of 
the minor ones were kept in a museum-like room inside the Palace, 
guarded day and night by dedicated and elite soldiers. 

She was not surprised in the least to find a pair of skeletons wearing 
suits of ceremonial armor still guarding the door when she arrived. 
She barely glanced at them as she braced herself and pushed open the 
heavy doors, making a face at the loud grating noise they made as they 
slowly swung inwards. As soon as the opening was wide enough, she 
slipped inside and made a beeline for a simple glass case mounted on 
the far wall. 

&lt;Get the broach....&gt; the voice urged her as her mind recognized the 
golden broach used by then-Princess Serenity to make her 
transformation into Sailor Moon. She took a step back and shoved her 
hand forward, stopping a few inches away from the glass. A pressure 
wave blasted out from her palm and shattered the ancient glass, making 
a very strange sound as the shards fell to the floor. 

Michelle reached in and lifted the broach out of the case, examining 
it curiously before she tucked it away in her Lunar Space pocket and 
quickly retraced her steps back up to the top of the Palace and 
towards the bubble generator building. 

When she reached the building, she stopped and staggered slightly, the 
red in her eyes quickly fading and restoring their natural aquamarine 
color as the invading mind withdrew. She stopped and blinked in 
confusion as she looked around, wondering if she had imagined seeing 
something. 

&quot;Oh, that feels SO much better,&quot; Alex said as she walked out of the 
small building, still puffing slightly from climbing the steep stairs. 
&quot;Hey, where&#39;d Susan crawl off to now?&quot; 

&quot;What? Oh, umm.... she said she was going to the Market Square to see 
where we had died,&quot; Michelle said with a sour look. 

&quot;Joy,&quot; the blonde replied. &quot;Bad enough we have to see skeletons 
aplenty, but now we get to look at our skeletons. Still, you got to 
admit, it&#39;s not every day that you get to see your own corpse,&quot; she 
said with a shrug. 

Michelle took hold of Alex&#39;s arms and drew close. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she said 
softly. &quot;This place is starting to get to me.&quot; 

Alex looked around once more and grunted. &quot;I hear you, love. C&#39;mon, I 
think the fastest route is this way,&quot; she said as they started 
walking. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; Rune fumed loudly as she walked the hallway towards 
the throne room. &quot;Two of them are parked over the oceans, and the only 
way we can tell where they are is by a very small noise signature. And 
the one that we can see is still on a direct course, still moving 
slower than a newly hatched vep&#39;tera, still isn&#39;t talking to us, and 
nobody has the first p&#39;takh&#39;enn clue what their intentions are. Am I 
right?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren took a deep breath as she followed Rune into the vast throne 
room and toward the Inner Chambers. &quot;I don&#39;t like this anymore than 
you do,&quot; she said sourly. &quot;At least they&#39;re keeping their distance 
from my fleet, and they have their orders if they should come under 
attack.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s a small comfort considering your all-powerful fleet won&#39;t be 
able to intervene if something starts here,&quot; Rune snarled as she 
entered the Inner Chamber and traditional center of power in the 
Negaverse. &quot;I need to know what that woman is up to.&quot; 

Both women started and whirled around as the doors slammed shut of 
their own accord, the sound of the locks engaging echoing in the 
sudden silence like a death knell. &quot;Perhaps you should ask,&quot; said a 
voice behind them, and they whirled around once more. 

&quot;Who the....&quot; Rune began to say, then fell silent as the sight of her 
unexpected visitor registered on her mind. 

&quot;I trust you&#39;ll forgive me sealing off this room without warning,&quot; she 
said from where she was sitting behind the ancient desk, &quot;But I 
thought it best that the two... or as it seems, three of us have a 
little talk first.&quot; 

Rune blinked hard. She had been seriously wounded once before, when 
she accidentally intercepted a team of assassins who planned to kill 
Queen Beryl. The knife had entered her side with surprisingly little 
pain, but the feeling that would forever haunt her was the sensation 
of warmth draining away as her blood pooled on the floor. That same 
feeling of vanishing warmth engulfed her now as she stared at visage 
sitting before her. 

&quot;General Nop&#39;tera....&quot; Admiral Si&#39;ren said softly, she herself briefly 
reliving her own worst state of shock. 

Nop&#39;tera nodded as she stood up, her white hair and featureless yellow 
eyes standing out in stark contrast to her dark blue skin and black 
uniform. &quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren, current Fleet Admiral, I presume? I must 
admit that, after having fought and nearly lost several crucial 
battles involving sea-going warships, I have developed a healthier 
respect for our Navy.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren could only blink in surprise at the words, delivered in a calm 
and respectful tone. 

&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; Rune said as she finally found her 
voice. 

There were no irises or pupils in Nop&#39;tera&#39;s eyes, only an expanse of 
yellow. The only indication that her gaze shifted from Si&#39;ren to Rune 
was a slight movement of the eyelids, a movement that would have gone 
unnoticed by people not used to dealing with featureless eyes, one of 
the more rarer results of the mutation-like chaos visited upon 
denizens as a result of puberty. 

&quot;I would like to ask the same of you, General Rune,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said 
evenly. &quot;My carrier isn&#39;t even clear of the Hinterland Rift and we get 
fired on, none of my communication requests on the Datalius network 
are answered, and since I can&#39;t get confirmation that the broadcast 
frequencies aren&#39;t compromised, I have to resort to sneaking into the 
Royal Palace. Which was not exactly an easy task,&quot; she added. 

&quot;Nor should it have been,&quot; Rune replied, her dark eyes narrowed. &quot;If I 
may inquire, General Nop&#39;tera, what exactly is this Datalius network 
you are referring to? We have received no such communications at all 
from any of your carriers.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera blinked. &quot;The Queen promoted you to Commander-General in my 
absence, and didn&#39;t tell you of the Datalius network?&quot; she said 
slowly. &quot;I find that a little hard to believe.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren felt a cold draft blow down her spine as Nop&#39;tera mentioned the 
promotion and her absence at the time. &quot;With all due respect,&quot; she 
said very carefully, &quot;Rune&#39;s so-called promotion was done according to 
law upon the death of the Queen and the absence of any higher-ranking 
member of the Army.&quot; 

Both Rune and Si&#39;ren blinked as Nop&#39;tera sighed and rubbed her 
temples. &quot;So much information gets missed when you&#39;re in another 
dimension. I heard of the Queen&#39;s demise, of course, but not that her 
successor was.... uninformed. So this wasn&#39;t something that was 
planned, I assume? Your promotion, not the death of Queen Beryl,&quot; the 
Dark General amended. 

&quot;It was, shall we say, anticipated by some,&quot; Rune said carefully. 

&quot;But not by Beryl,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said, saying it as a statement rather 
than as as question. She sighed heavily and plopped back down into the 
chair, one hand still rubbing her temple. &quot;If you&#39;ll pardon my saying 
so, Rune, this is quite a mess for one to come home to.&quot; 

Rune and Si&#39;ren exchanged concerned glances, neither having the 
faintest idea of how the situation was going to develop. Nop&#39;tera quit 
massaging her temple and looked up, frowning slightly at the 
expression on their faces. &quot;I get the distinct impression that you two 
have a lot on your minds.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s putting it mildly,&quot; Si&#39;ren observed. 

&quot;Very well then, let&#39;s get to the point, shall we?&quot; Nop&#39;tera said. 
&quot;You will find that in most cases, I am a very blunt individual and 
prefer that my officers be the same when dealing with me. That way, we 
can get right to the heart of the matter without fooling around. Is 
that okay with you?&quot; 

Rune heard a faint emphasis on the word &#39;heart&#39; and suppressed a 
shiver, not forgetting for an instant that Nop&#39;tera was an eternal 
vampire, transformed during a Bloodmoon conjunction and never returned 
to normal afterwards. Most agree that such a change was a result of 
the powers Nop&#39;tera developed during her childhood, but few would care 
to speculate about the destruction she might have caused before she 
learned how to control her vampiric nature. 

&quot;I have no problems with the idea,&quot; Rune said carefully. 

&quot;Excellent,&quot; the vampire replied with a faint smile. &quot;Now then, what 
sort of questions did you have for me?&quot; 

&quot;What exactly are your intentions?&quot; asked Rune. 

Nop&#39;tera stood up and walked to the edge of the desk. &quot;The conquest of 
the worlds on the other side of the Hinterland rift has taken four 
thousand years, and I should like to have a bit of a rest for myself 
and my divison. Before the usual spate of ceremonies and celebration 
are to begin, however, my division would like to hold a sort of 
memorial for our departed Queen. And once everything has been taken 
care of, my soldiers and I shall resume our respective posts in 
service to the military and the NegaForce.&quot; 

Rune blinked as a sense of unease made its way down her back. &quot;I must 
confess a bit of curiosity as to where your division will be 
assigned.&quot; 

The dark general frowned. &quot;The initial part of my division was drawn 
from the ranks of the Red Wings.&quot; 

Rune winced. &quot;I thought so, but the problem is that they were 
disbanded three thousand years ago,&quot; she said carefully, adding a bit 
of faked sympathy to her tone. 

&quot;Then it seems the Red Wings are about to be recommissioned.&quot; 

Rune frowned slightly at the tone in Nop&#39;tera&#39;s voice. &quot;I think it 
would be a somewhat simple matter to do so and have you officially 
appointed as the division commander.&quot; 

&quot;Actually, my second-in-command has been deserving of the position for 
quite some time, and I should like to see it given to him,&quot; Nop&#39;tera 
replied smoothly, her casual tone sending a chill down Si&#39;ren&#39;s back. 

Rune hesitated for a brief moment. &quot;If your second-in-command is to be 
named as the divisional commander, then what exactly would your 
position be?&quot; 

A slender eyebrow rose in response. &quot;I&#39;ll admit surprise that you have 
to ask, General Rune,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said slowly. &quot;As the highest ranking 
general in the Army with the most seniority, the laws are quite clear 
that I become the Commander-General until my death or retirement. Of 
course, I would also wield the power of the throne until a new 
monarchy is established, but I honestly hope that will take no more 
than a decade or two.... a century at most.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren watched the color drain from Rune&#39;s face and discreetly took a 
step forward. &quot;Speaking only for myself, General Nop&#39;tera, I find it 
rather.... disquieting that you would seek control of the military 
after such a prolonged absence. I have no objection at present for 
your eventual promotion to the position, provided you haven&#39;t found 
retirement desirable by that time, but I do believe this is a rather 
sudden turn of events.&quot; 

The vampire nodded towards the admiral. &quot;I will admit that one does 
lose touch of events when you&#39;re conducting a war, especially when it 
involves a dimensional shift. I am not suggesting I be handed the keys 
to the Imperial Castle when my carrier lands in two days, as that 
would be too sudden a change. No, what I have in mind is an adjustment 
period of a few months, perhaps a full year if necessary, to 
reacquaint myself with the present-day military before I take full 
command. As my present second-in-command would by then be in charge of 
the Red Wings, I would need someone with a great deal of experience to 
fill the position, and who would be better suited for that than 
General Rune?&quot; 

&quot;If I may ask,&quot; Rune said slowly as she struggled to control her 
reaction to Nop&#39;tera&#39;s words, &quot;How long do you plan on staying in the 
military? I can&#39;t think of anyone who would think that after five 
thousand years of faithful and valiant service to the military you 
haven&#39;t earned the right to relax and enjoy the rest of your life in 
peace.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera slowly drew herself to her full height. &quot;When I joined the 
military so long ago,&quot; she said slowly, making sure each syllable of 
each word was heard, &quot;I decided that I would serve the throne and the 
NegaForce until I felt that I could accomplish no more in my lifetime, 
at which point I would accept retirement and enjoy the rest of my time 
in relative peace. However, it seems I&#39;ve been given the gift of an 
eternal lifespan, so I shall continue to serve until I am either 
dismissed by the Queen, discover that my lifespan is near a natural 
end, or until I die in the line of duty. But until such an event 
happens to occur, I will not retire. Is that understood, General 
Rune?&quot; 

Both Rune and Si&#39;ren shivered involuntarily at the icy tone in the 
dark general&#39;s voice. &quot;Understood perfectly, General Nop&#39;tera,&quot; Rune 
replied, somehow managing to keep her voice steady and even. 

&quot;Do you have any other questions for me?&quot; 

It took a great deal of control for Rune to calmly reply, &quot;I think 
you&#39;ve answered all of my questions for the present.&quot; 

A dark smile appeared on Nop&#39;tera&#39;s lips. &quot;Excellent. Then if you will 
excuse me, I must return to my division and prepare for the landing.&quot; 
She tugged on her uniform for a moment to straighten it out before she 
began to walk towards the still-sealed door. She paused before opening 
it and turned around to give Rune and Si&#39;ren a thoughtful look. 

&quot;Oh, about the Datalius network, Rune.... make sure most of the desk 
is cleared off first. Insert the drawer key into the lock on the 
topmost drawer, turn it all the way to the right, push inwards, then 
turn it a quarter turn to the left,&quot; she explained before she pressed 
a button to unlock the massive doors to the Inner Chambers. 

Rune waited until the doors closed behind Nop&#39;tera before taking a 
deep breath and carefully sitting down in the cushioned chair. She 
studied the ancient desk and the pattern of tiny cracks ingrained in 
the wood for a few moments before leaning back to search for her 
personal set of keys. 

&quot;That could have gone a lot worse,&quot; Si&#39;ren finally commented. 

Rune looked up sharply, giving the admiral a piercing stare. &quot;Oh? I&#39;ve 
just been told we&#39;re about to be taken over by someone who hasn&#39;t set 
foot in the Negaverse in a thousand years and seems not to hesitate to 
destroy anything or anyone that stands in her way. So tell me, my dear 
Fleet Admiral, how could things have gotten worse?&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;re still alive, aren&#39;t we?&quot; 

Rune paused to think about that for a moment. &quot;You do seem to have a 
bit of a point,&quot; she finally admitted with a heavy sigh as she pulled 
her set of keys from her pocket. &quot;Question is, for how long?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren said nothing as Rune inserted the key into the lock and twisted 
it to the far right. There was a slight resistance as she pushed the 
housing inward and turned the key to the left. There was a very faint 
clicking noise and the surface of the desk seemed to liquify into a 
puddle of silvery goo. 

&quot;Symipa?&quot; Si&#39;ren asked as they watched the metallic liquid began to 
ooze into a new shape, slowly forming into a surpisingly sophisticated 
communication center. 

&quot;No one said the technology was restricted to only making them into 
those bladed-staff weapons,&quot; Rune replied with a shrug, fascinated 
with the desk&#39;s transformation. &quot;To tell you the truth, I always 
wondered about the supposed limitations on the molecular patterns you 
could make with the stuff.&quot; 

The console finally solidified and a display promptly lit up, the 
speaker making a soft beeping noise. The layout, although complex, was 
familiar enough to Rune for her to identify it as a secure 
communications request from another network user. &quot;Well, well, what 
have we here?&quot; she muttered to herself as she pressed a button and 
leaned foward, listening intently to the speaking. 

The line crackled faintly to itself for a moment before a deep voice 
said, &quot;Identify yourself.&quot; 

Rune frowned slightly. &quot;This is Commander-General Rune,&quot; she said. 

The voice replied at once. &quot;Ma&#39;am, this is General Ar&#39;kanis, 
commanding the airborne flagship V&#39;ral, requesting a flight path and 
landing clearance for approach to the Imperial Castle. ETA is 
approximately the thirteenth hour in two standard days.&quot; 

&quot;This is not the proper channel for the air traffic authority,&quot; Rune 
said, her voice as cold as ice. 

The speaker seemed to hiss with concealed rage. &quot;Air traffic control 
does not possess sufficient safeguards on the secure channel to 
prevent data interception. As per standard procedure, we are 
defaulting to contacting the closest communication network that is 
both relevant and possesses the necessary safeguards for this 
communications request.&quot; 

Rune stared at the speaker for a moment and was ready to lash out at 
the carrier&#39;s commander when Si&#39;ren reached past her and held her 
finger down on the mute button. &quot;They&#39;re using the same procedure the 
Navy uses today,&quot; she said softly, &quot;So ripping him a new p&#39;tanka won&#39;t 
help matters.&quot; 

&quot;You deal with him, then,&quot; Rune growled as she sat back in the chair. 

Si&#39;ren lifted her finger off the mute button. &quot;This is Fleet Admiral 
Si&#39;ren,&quot; she said into the microphone. &quot;The V&#39;ral is advised to 
maintain present course, altitude, and speed, and will be granted an 
approach vector and landing clearance by air traffic control upon 
final approach to the Imperial Castle. Be advised that the airspace 
above both oceans has been designated as restricted until further 
notice. Your other two carriers are ordered to stand down their 
radar-evasion screens and to dock at the appropriate naval shipyards 
as soon as possible.&quot; 

The speaker was silent for a full twenty seconds. &quot;Maintain present 
course, speed, and altitude, acknowledged,&quot; the deep voice finally 
replied. &quot;The restricted airspace warning and landing instructions 
will be passed on to the other carriers as soon as possible. Flagship 
V&#39;ral out.&quot; 

&quot;That was interesting,&quot; Rune observed as Si&#39;ren closed the connection. 

&quot;It&#39;ll be interesting to see what the carriers will actually do,&quot; 
Si&#39;ren replied as she sat on the edge of the desk and gave the 
communications console a wary look. &quot;With as long as I&#39;ve been the 
Fleet Admiral, you would think that someone would have told me about 
this little setup of Beryl&#39;s.&quot; 

&quot;You would think so, but with this place....&quot; Rune said, then left her 
sentence unfinished with a heavy sigh. &quot;I think it&#39;s time to call all 
the divisional and regional commanders in for a meeting.&quot; 

Si&#39;ren frowned. &quot;About...?&quot; she prompted. 

&quot;About the future of the military, and consequently the Negaverse as a 
whole,&quot; Rune replied as she closed her eyes and began massaging her 
temples. &quot;The question is rather simple.... do we think Nop&#39;tera is 
fit to remain in the military, or has she become as outdated as her 
fleet and should be asked to retire?&quot; 

Si&#39;ren blinked hard. &quot;And if she refuses?&quot; 

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Rune said softly. She heard only silence in reply 
and nodded to herself. &quot;It&#39;s a shame really,&quot; she said, more to 
herself than to Si&#39;ren as she reached forward and turned the key back 
to the right, causing the Datalius network interface to dissolve into 
a puddle and reshape itself back into the desktop. &quot;You can&#39;t help but 
admire her devotion to her duty for close to five thousand years, but 
as with all things.... what goes up, even to the highest ranks of the 
military.... must come down.&quot; 

Rune stood up and looked over at Si&#39;ren. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me, 
Admiral, I have a few people to get in touch with,&quot; she said, then 
turned and left the room. 

Si&#39;ren still said nothing as she slowly sat down in the chair that was 
positioned behind the most powerful desk in the Negaverse. She could 
hear the fading sound of Rune&#39;s footsteps echoing down the hallway and 
began to wonder what the future would hold.... and where the true 
danger comes from. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Susan looked up as the faint crunching noise of the footsteps reached 
her ears. &quot;Feeling better?&quot; she asked when they came into view. 

Alex made a sour face. &quot;Only partially. Bladder&#39;s fine right now, but 
seeing all these bodies is really, really starting to spook me.&quot; 

&quot;You might not want to get any closer, then,&quot; Susan suggested as she 
knelt back down to re-examine the small group of corpses clustered 
together. 

The blonde glanced over her shoulder to look at Michelle, squeezing 
her hand gently at the haunted look on her face. &quot;It&#39;s okay, love, 
we&#39;re still alive.... I think.&quot; 

A dry chuckle emerged from Susan&#39;s throat. &quot;Relax, you are very much 
alive,&quot; she said as she stood up and made a gesture. &quot;A pity I can&#39;t 
say the same for your former body.&quot; 

Alex glanced down at the mangled remains and felt her stomach twinge 
briefly. &quot;That&#39;s me, huh? I don&#39;t see how you can tell, though,&quot; she 
said as she tilted her head to one side. Behind her, Michelle tugged 
her hand free of the blonde&#39;s grip and wrapped both hands around her 
waist, hugging her tightly. 

&quot;Well, if you look here, you can see where the rib was once broken and 
had mended,&quot; Susan explain as she pointed at the corpse. &quot;Left side, 
third one up from the bottom. Also, I found this lying in the dirt 
next to the skull,&quot; she said as she held up a partially melted 
earring. 

&quot;Ouch, looks like mine alright,&quot; the blonde said before she glanced at 
the remains. Most of the right arm was missing and almost the entire 
right side of the skull had been shattered by a tremendous force. 
&quot;That looked like it would have hurt something fierce.&quot; 

Susan nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll bet it did. I still can&#39;t locate my body, though. 
I&#39;m not quite sure that I even have one, seeing how the blast was 
enough to cause this much damage.&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s a cheerful prospect,&quot; Alex muttered as she stared at her 
corpse. &quot;You know....&quot; 

&quot;Over here,&quot; Myst suddenly interrupted. &quot;I think this one had wings.&quot; 

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Susan said, more to the corpse than Alex as she gingerly 
stepped over the remains to walk over to where Myst was carefully 
examining a seriously mishappen corpse. 

&quot;You alright?&quot; Alex asked softly as she gently rubbed the arms tightly 
clinging to her waist. 

&quot;Get us out of here,&quot; Michelle whispered, almost in tears. 

&quot;Just as soon as Sue figures out what she&#39;s doing,&quot; Alex replied. 

They watched in silence as Susan knelt down to examine the corpse Myst 
had indicated. Even from a distance they could see a pair of curious 
protrusions at the base of what was left of the skeleton&#39;s shoulder 
blades. The bony nubs appeared to be intact instead of broken or 
sheared, which unfortunately could not be said for virtually all of 
the skeleton&#39;s ribs. The sight of so much skeletal damage made Alex 
wary to think of what the blast had been like. 

&quot;So what do you think we&#39;ll find on Earth?&quot; Alex said, trying to make 
conversation in an attempt to calm Michelle and herself down. She 
alternated her gaze between the demonic wings emerging from Susan&#39;s 
exposed back and the remains of the thousand-year-old skeleton. I 
never really stopped to think about it, she thought, but if the bones 
in her wings aren&#39;t solidly attached to her back, then they would need 
something for the muscles to hold on to. And if those protrusions on 
the skeleteon are what I think they are.... 

It took Michelle a few moments to gather the strength to speak. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know,&quot; she replied softly. &quot;Somehow I don&#39;t think the Earth 
kingdoms are left standing either. At least, not as we know them.&quot; 

Alex blinked. &quot;What, you think the Negaverse destroyed them too?&quot; 

Michelle shook her head gently. &quot;No, something tells me they never 
made it to Earth, but.... you know how unstable the kingdoms were.&quot; 

The blonde grunted. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;ve got a point. I know Serenity did her 
best to convince that one kingdom to refrain from invading those 
barbarians to the east, but knowing them they probably decided to 
throw a crusade anyway. And you know those barbarians were never one 
to turn down an invitation to attend a small war....&quot; 

&quot;Well, since it&#39;s now past history instead of future occurences,&quot; 
Susan said as she slowly stood up, holding a pair of metallic rods in 
her hands, &quot;I think it&#39;s safe to tell you that there indeed was a 
crusade in Earth&#39;s history, and that the barbarians decided to join 
the fun, as it were.&quot; 

Alex frowned lightly. &quot;Past history now, huh? Anything else you want 
to share with us?&quot; 

&quot;The Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the exploration of the western 
continent, the Renaissance, the French Revolution....&quot; the succubus 
said as she walked towards them, tightly gripping the shattered 
remains of her staff. &quot;Two global wars, countless localized conflicts, 
the Black Plague.... I&#39;m almost sorry I missed out on that particular 
harvesting of souls,&quot; she added quietly to herself. 

&quot;And of course all of those events you&#39;ve named just happen to involve 
a significant amount of violence, bloodshed, destruction, and of 
course death, which is your favorite event second only to sex. Am I 
right?&quot; Alex muttered dourly as she squeezed Michelle&#39;s hand. 

&quot;But of course,&quot; said a quiet voice behind the blonde. 

Alex somehow managed to hold onto Michelle and whirl around at the 
same time, keeping her lover protectively behind her. Her eyes went 
wide at the sight of a scantily-clad woman casually sitting on a 
massive chunk of marble. Her dark green hair seemed to spill over her 
shoulders and flow down her back, neatly bisecting the massive pair of 
wings emerging from her shoulder blades. A tiny pair of wings could be 
seen emerging from her hair, drawing attention away from her unearthly 
beauty. 

&quot;But then again,&quot; she continued softly, &quot;Most succubi would find it 
rather arousing to be a part of such death and destruction. Wouldn&#39;t 
you agree, Lady Pluto?&quot; 

Susan frowned lightly at her visitor&#39;s use of her official title in 
the Moon Kingdom. &quot;It all depends on one&#39;s role in the situation. Who 
are you?&quot; she asked, ignoring the uncertain looks she was getting from 
everyone else. 

The succubus tilted her head to one side and slowly ran her tongue 
over her lips. &quot;An emmisary of our lord Hades. You may call me Megan.&quot; 

A delicate eyebrow rose in response. &quot;I know I&#39;ve been away for quite 
some time, but I seriously doubt Megan is a demonic name,&quot; Susan said. 

&quot;No less demonic than Susan,&quot; Megan replied with a knowing smile. 

Alex carefully cleared her throat. &quot;Umm, excuse me....&quot; she said 
slowly as she alternated her gaze between Susan and Megan. &quot;I don&#39;t 
mean to be interrupting what looks to be a demonic family reunion 
here, but can someone kindly explain what&#39;s going on?&quot; She had already 
noticed that they both shared the exact same shade of dark green hair 
and bore a seeming resemblance, a fact that she found more than 
slightly unsettling. 

Megan gave the blonde an apprasing look. &quot;Ooo, a human! Two of them, 
in fact,&quot; she said as she glanced behind Alex and gave Michelle a 
small smile. &quot;I haven&#39;t had the chance to play with one in ages. Can I 
borrow one for a few hours?&quot; she asked, casting a hopeful glance 
towards Susan. 

&quot;They&#39;re avatars,&quot; Susan explained with a small smile. 

&quot;Awww....&quot; Megan replied as she gave Alex a disappointed look. 

&quot;Wait a minute here....&quot; Alex said somewhat nervously. 

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Alex, I&#39;m sure Megan didn&#39;t have any bad intentions,&quot; 
Susan said as she gave the pure-blood succubus a look that said she 
had damn well better not. 

She gave Susan an apologetic shrug. &quot;I haven&#39;t had the chance to find 
anyone for a little stress-relief in the past few days,&quot; she said as 
she cast a wistful glance in Alex&#39;s direction. &quot;And it&#39;s not my fault 
she&#39;s pretty.&quot; 

Susan nodded slowly. &quot;Understood. I trust you&#39;re here for a reason?&quot; 

Megan sighed and slid down off of the marble ruins. She was wearing an 
almost translucent purple ribbon of fabric around her waist that rose 
up to cross over her breasts before being tied off in a simple knot 
behind her neck. A fairly wide black loin-cloth hung down almost to 
her ankles from a silver belt at her waist, and a pair of black 
panties could be glimpsed beneath the loin-cloth. 

&quot;Lord Hades is quite adamant that you return with me to the Underworld 
at once,&quot; Megan said as she stretched, flexing wings that were nearly 
double the size of Susan&#39;s wings. &quot;And given the fact that he is not 
the most patient of Gods, I have no choice but to ensure that you are 
summoned to him in a very timely fashion. So, if you will agree to the 
Pact....&quot; she said as she drew herself close Susan, the tiny pair of 
wings on her head fluttering slightly. 

&quot;Whoa, wait a minute....&quot; Alex started to say. 

Susan shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Alex, but I have no choice. I&#39;ll be 
back as soon as I possibly can. Keep and eye on Michelle and Myst for 
me, please.&quot; She turned her attention to Megan and nodded. &quot;Of course 
I accept the Pact.&quot; 

&quot;But...!&quot; the blonde tried to say. 

&quot;I&#39;ll return her, I promise,&quot; Megan said as she took hold of Susan&#39;s 
arm and gave her a gentle but deep kiss. With the personal contact 
established by her kiss, Megan extended her demonic powers both inward 
and outward, opening up a dimensional rift and transporting them into 
the Underworld. 

Susan closed her eyes and savored the kiss of another of her kind as 
only a succubus could experience it. While the succubi could affect 
other beings through an assortment of indirect methods, none was as 
potentially dangerous or as deadly as their kiss. With it, they could 
tap directly into a person&#39;s soul and do as they please with the 
energy contained within. 

Having been created with an extremely strong desire for physical 
intimacy that few could resist for long, the succubi often turned to 
each other for the pleasure and sexual release they needed. Knowing 
the danger their kiss posed to others, a mutual agreement called the 
Pact was developed in which each promises to refrain from using any 
hostile or harmful powers when kissing the other. Violations of the 
Pact were exceedingly rare, as a succubus who would not be trusted by 
others to safely share intimacy lived a very miserable life. 

Megan held the kiss for awhile after the dimension shift was complete, 
taking the opportunity to lightly probe the outermost edges of Susan&#39;s 
soul. Susan was immediately aware of the probe but cautiously let it 
continue. Under more relaxed settings she would indulged in a probe of 
her own, but she was keenly aware of her current situation and wasn&#39;t 
in the mood for it. Megan sensed the unease in Susan&#39;s soul and gently 
withdrew the probe before she broke the kiss and took a step back, 
taking the chance to get a very close look at one of the more 
well-known succubi in the Underworld. 

&quot;Problem?&quot; Susan asked as she studied the surroundings. Unlike most of 
the Underworld, which was lit in some way or another by fire, this 
particular section was in total darkness save for the faint blue glow 
surrounding a sealed archway. To her horror she realized that they 
were standing before the Portal of Time, a physical conduit into the 
eternal flow. Usually the room would have been brightly lit by the 
glow of the swirling maelstrom of the open portal, but now that it was 
sealed shut the room looked more like a crypt than the doorway into 
the nexus of temporal energy. 

Megan shook her head gently. &quot;No, but after you are finished with Lord 
Hades, you and I need to find a place to sit down and talk.... 
Setsuna.&quot; 

Susan&#39;s eyes went wide at the mention of her true-name before she 
managed to regain some semblance of her usual composure. &quot;How did 
you...?&quot; 

Megan laid a finger on Susan&#39;s lips, stilling them. &quot;Later,&quot; she said 
very quietly before she gave her another kiss, this one significantly 
warmer than the one used to shift them between the planes. The 
succubus then took a step back before disappearing in a brief flash of 
dimensional energy. 

Susan barely had time to comprehend things before she felt a powerful 
presence behind her and heard a deep voice speaking her name. 
&quot;Setsuna.... It&#39;s been a long time, my child.&quot; 

Susan spun around and knelt down before the wraith-like figure that 
emerged from the surrounding darkness. &quot;My lord....&quot; 

Hades, God of the Underworld, shook his head and pulled her up to her 
feet. &quot;There is no time for formalities, child. Give me the Key.&quot; 

Susan looked up and held out the ruined pieces of her staff. &quot;My lord, 
the Key was destroyed during the battle in the Moon Kingdom,&quot; she said 
almost sadly. 

Hades blinked as he accepted the broken staff from his avatar. &quot;So 
this explains matters....&quot; he said quietly. He turned around and 
looked into the darkness at something Susan wasn&#39;t able to see. 
&quot;Hephaestus, can you possibly reforge this?&quot; 

A shadowy figure emerged from the darkness surrounding Susan and 
Hades. &quot;Let me see,&quot; the gruff voice of the God of the Forge said as 
he drew near, moving with a pronounced limp. He took the shattered 
halves of the Key from Hades, hefted them in his hands for a moment, 
and spat on the floor. 

&quot;I told you tying her soul to the Key would weaken it,&quot; Hephaestus 
said with a snarl. 

&quot;Enough bickering,&quot; said a third voice as its owner stepped out from 
the darkness. A crown of lightning bolts adorned his head, adding a 
glow to the room and lessening the darkness. &quot;What&#39;s done is done. Can 
it be fixed?&quot; 

Susan knelt down before the new arrival and bowed her head, showing 
the respect due to the king of the Gods while Hades gave a respectful 
nod to his brother. &quot;The Key is only physically broken. The power it 
contains is intact, but useless until the body is reforged,&quot; 
Hephaestus said. 

Zeus grunted softly. &quot;Back to your forge with you, then. I don&#39;t think 
anyone needs to remind you of the importance of that Key.&quot; The lame 
God sighed almost inaudibly as he made a gesture and disappeared in a 
subdued flash of light. 

&quot;Knowing him, it shouldn&#39;t take him long to fix it,&quot; Hades said. 

&quot;Once he gets to his precious forge,&quot; Zeus replied. &quot;Might take him a 
bit to do just that. He never was much of a runner,&quot; he added with a 
dark smile. 

Susan said nothing and remained perfectly still as she listened, 
knowing that only a God like Zeus could make fun of Hephaestus&#39;s 
lameness and not be struck down by the artificier. She suspected that 
Hephaestus would get even with the Thunder God in some indirect way 
for the comment, usually by taking it out on his followers, and she 
was suddenly grateful that Fate had chosen for her to serve Hades 
instead of Zeus. 

&quot;So this is your long-lost avatar,&quot; Zeus mused as he carefully studied 
Susan. &quot;And a succubus, at that. How&#39;d you let that happen, by the 
way?&quot; 

&quot;Her heritage or misplacing her for a thousand years?&quot; Hades grumbled. 

Zeus chuckled. &quot;I think her mother would be the best one to answer 
that first question. And in any case, we could always blame Aphrodite. 
You really should keep a closer eye on your avatars, you know, if only 
to keep surprises from showing up in a generation or two.&quot; 

Hades cast an unamused glance towards his elder brother. &quot;Strange, I 
could have sworn that your avatar was currently involved with an 
alien, and if it wasn&#39;t for the incompatibility she&#39;d probably be 
bearing his child by now. If you find Setsuna&#39;s heritage disturbing, 
try to imagine what the other one would look like.&quot; 

Zeus grunted to himself. &quot;I&#39;m trying not to,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;I could 
always intervene like Ares did....&quot; 

&quot;And hear no peace from Gaea for a millenium,&quot; Hades finished for him. 

The Thunder God rolled his eyes. &quot;She&#39;s just pissed because she 
doesn&#39;t have an avatar of her own to toy with. Although I must admit 
that after stopping to think about it, I could find several uses for a 
succubus as an avatar,&quot; he said as he eyed Susan&#39;s slender form. 

&quot;Have a little respect for her,&quot; Hades said with a discernable edge to 
his low tone. &quot;Setsuna&#39;s unique heritage has allowed her to perform 
her duties quite well for centuries, both as my avatar and as a 
Guardian of Time.&quot; 

&quot;And allowing the Portal to close and vanishing for a thousand years 
is performing her duties well?&quot; Zeus demanded, the crown on his head 
beginning to crackle with his anger. 

&quot;What of the other avatars, then?&quot; Hades countered. &quot;How long ago were 
they reincarnated, without their memories or any knowledge of their 
true purpose? If it wasn&#39;t for the foresight and wisdom of their 
Oracle, they would still know nothing!&quot; 

Zeus said nothing as he stared at the sealed portal, his legendary 
temper simmering dangerously. Hades took a deep breath and continued 
in a measured tone. &quot;We do not know exactly what happened that caused 
the Portal to seal itself shut, but perhaps now that Setsuna has 
returned, we can find out.&quot; 

&quot;Speak, succubus,&quot; Zeus said quietly as he tempered his anger. &quot;Tell 
us what happened to you and the Key.&quot; 

Susan feared few things in life, but Zeus&#39;s reputation for taking his 
fury out on the bearers of bad news was certainly one of them. Taking 
a deep breath and trying to quit trembling, she quietly began to 
relate the events that took place in the final days of the Moon 
Kingdom. 

Neither of the Gods said anything as they listened to her words. She 
told them of the warning Queen Serenity had been given so long ago, 
and about the many years of quiet preparation for an invasion. Even 
with so much advanced warning, the actual attack had come as a 
complete surprise as legions of the alien warriors had emerged from 
the great dimensional rifts that opened up at the edges of the 
Kingdom. 

The initial losses were staggering and forced them to abandon the 
outer perimeter. They regrouped as they fell back and made their stand 
in a large ring surrounding the Royal Palace. The frontal assault 
against the phalanx of defenders quickly degenerated into hand-to-hand 
combat, and it was then that the colossal Shadow Warrior began to 
attack the Palace itself. A decision was made by the Queen&#39;s Celestial 
Guardians to split up: Four of them were to fall back to protect the 
Queen and deal with the Shadow Warrior while the remaining three were 
to remain on the front lines, defending the perimeter. 

Sailor Pluto led the counter-attack, unleashing her demonic powers 
with a fury few had ever seen as she pressed forward. Not very far 
behind her, Sailor Uranus was wreaking her own brand of havoc, her 
glittering Soul Saber cutting a path through the enemy lines and 
leaving an unholy mess in her wake. Sailor Neptune stayed very close 
to Uranus, using her Soul Mirror to ward off attacks and reflecting 
some of them back at their alien owners. 

The trio of Sailor Scouts were able to make serious progress in 
decimating the enemy&#39;s front lines before they encountered a small 
unit of elite troops led by a warrior in dark armor and holding a 
strangely glowing sword. It soon became obvious that the sword was 
every bit as powerful as Uranus&#39;s Saber, cutting down all who stood in 
it&#39;s path. Realizing the danger the glowing blade posed, the Sailor 
Scouts quickly made a radical change in tactics in the hopes of 
catching the warrior off-guard. 

Ironically, the warrior had thought of the same plan and made a 
surprise change in his own tactics. The two groups met sooner than 
expected, and Pluto found herself suddenly under attack by the glowing 
sword. Skilled as she was in the art of combat, her staff simply 
wasn&#39;t enough to hold off the elite warrior at close range. As she 
tried to fall back to give herself enough room to use her demonic 
powers, she found herself under attack from all sides. She lashed out 
to one side with her staff to protect her flanks, saw the warrior 
sieze the opportunity, and instinctively brought her staff up to try 
to defend against the sword stroke that, unblocked, would surely have 
eviscerated her. 

&quot;And that&#39;s when the Key was snapped in half?&quot; Hades asked quietly 
when Susan fell silent, unable to continue with the final moments of 
her story. 

&quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; Susan replied quietly. &quot;I.... I remember the sound of 
it snapping, and then.... I remember nothing.&quot; 

Zeus sighed quietly to himself, his anger calmed by Susan&#39;s story. 
&quot;The blade had to have been their version of a Soul Reaver,&quot; he 
grumbled. &quot;The Key should have been able to withstand the blow itself, 
but because her soul was part of it....&quot; He trailed off and sighed 
quietly again. &quot;Do you know what we had to do to keep the vibes from 
the Portal from tearing Creation apart?&quot; he asked Susan. &quot;Do you know 
what that damned blade cost us?&quot; 

&quot;No, my lord,&quot; Susan replied. 

Hades spoke quietly. &quot;Every single one of us had to merge our powers 
together in a sort of brace around the Portal to keep the vibes from 
spreading around. With the entire pantheon occupied thus, we were 
unable to maintain our presence on Earth and in very short order 
became mere myths in the eyes of the mortals.&quot; 

Susan blinked hard. She knew from her time travels that the pantheon&#39;s 
influence began to wane after the introduction of Christianity into 
the region on Earth known as Europe, but hadn&#39;t been aware of their 
utter disappearance. 

Zeus grunted. &quot;And now that we&#39;ve been all but totally abandoned for 
the past millenia, could you imagine what it would be like if we tried 
to resume our roles? One whiff of our existence and the infidels would 
instantly start a war. I don&#39;t know how familiar you are with their 
present-day technology, Setsuna, but they possess sufficient firepower 
to incinerate the entire globe a dozen times over.&quot; 

&quot;A little war now and then is good for business,&quot; Hades said lightly. 

The Thunder God shot him a dark look. &quot;I see you&#39;ve forgotten about 
that little backlog of souls you acquired during their second global 
war when they erased a pair of cities off the map in the blink of an 
eye,&quot; he grumbled. 

&quot;They were all processed in due time,&quot; the God of the Underworld 
replied. &quot;Besides, I said a little war, not the Apocalypse.&quot; 

&quot;Are you.... gentlemen finished?&quot; a sultry voice interrupted as a very 
beautiful figure stepped out from the shadows surrounding the Portal. 

Hades bowed his head respectfully while Zeus gave the new arrival a 
mild look. &quot;What do you want, woman?&quot; 

The goddess shrugged. &quot;I heard that the Key had returned and wanted to 
see for myself if it were true. I see Hades&#39;s beloved Guardian has 
returned, looking as beautiful as ever, but no sign of either the Key 
or an end to this wretched confinement. Or, it seems, to the endless 
babble of men about the art of War,&quot; she added pointedly. 

&quot;I see you&#39;re as charming as ever,&quot; Zeus sneered. 

Aphrodite waved her hand. &quot;You should hear what that bloodthirsty 
bastard has to say about the &#39;impending and glorious Apocalypse&#39;,&quot; she 
said, rolling her eyes. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be sure to let Ares know that you think so highly of him,&quot; Zeus 
replied. &quot;Although I&#39;m still not quite sure why you haven&#39;t bedded him 
yet. They do say Love and War are on the opposite side of the same 
coin.&quot; 

The goddess gave him a decidedly glacial look. &quot;Funny you should 
mention bedding people. I hear your avatar has found herself a rather 
interesting companion yet again. At least it&#39;s a male this time,&quot; she 
added with a smile. 

&quot;It seems your avatar as well has found a lover of her own that is, 
shall we say, decidedly different,&quot; Zeus said, his voice edged with 
his anger. The corner of his mouth twisted up into a cruel smile as he 
added, &quot;And what did Hermes do to you for his avatar to deserve a 
similar fate?&quot; 

Aphrodite sighed and looked away. &quot;I had nothing to do with that one,&quot; 
she said softly, surprising both Zeus and Hades with the sudden change 
in her mood. &quot;In fact, I had nothing to do with your avatar as well. 
Not this time at least. You know as well as I do that we can&#39;t 
intervene in matters related to the other side.&quot; 

Susan remained quiet as she listened to the gods talk among 
themselves, their words greatly disturbing her. She was fairly sure 
that the avatars they spoke of were in fact the other Sailor Scouts, 
but the mention of alien lovers was confusing at best and her sense of 
unease grew the more she thought about matters. 

Everyone looked up as there was a subdued flash of light and 
Hephaestus reappeared in the room holding the reforged staff. &quot;Try not 
to let it get broken this time,&quot; he grumbled as held it out to Susan. 

&quot;Thank you, my lord,&quot; Susan replied as she stood up and took the staff 
from him. A surge of immense power began to course through her veins 
in the instant that her fingers closed around the dark staff. She 
closed her eyes and yielded to the sensation, a thousand years of 
hunger and longing satisifed by a touch, a rejoining of the two parts 
of a whole that should never have been separated in the first place. 

She opened her eyes and turned towards the faintly glowing archway, 
now able to fully sense the power eminating from within. She felt more 
than saw the intricate network of divine forces surrounding the 
Portal, keeping it perfectly still despite the immense power 
precariously held at bay inside. As she drew closer to the archway, 
she could feel the Key begin to vibrate in her hands, resonating with 
the power of the Portal. 

She closed her eyes again and concentrated on the subharmonics both 
the Key and the Portal were producing. She carefully began to focus 
the energy of her staff in a precise pattern, trying to exactly match 
the harmonics with that of the Portal. The divine energy supporting 
the Portal made things somewhat more difficult and it took her longer 
than usual to tune the Key. 

As soon as the attunement was completed the Key began to hum audibly 
and vibrate faster. Susan fought a momentary struggle to retain her 
grip, took a deep breath, and inverted the subharmonics of the Key. 
The whole room began to resonate as the harmonics of the Key and 
Portal briefly interfered with each other. The two sets of energies 
began to cancel each other out, nullifying the restraining harmonics 
surrounding the Portal and allowing it to open with a blinding flash 
of blue light. 

The light seared her eyes and burned her flesh, the intense wave of 
utter agony coming as a complete surprise. She was only exposed to it 
for a moment before she was enveloped in a cloak of sorts, reducing 
the searing pain to a more tolerable level. The light persisted for a 
few moments before fading to the Portal&#39;s normal blue glow. It took 
her a few seconds before she was able to move, her skin feeling like 
it was partially blistered and torn away. She finally managed to open 
her eyes and discovered that her skin was very much intact and 
undamaged, despite what her nerves were claiming. 

The same wave of light that inflicted so much agony on Susan&#39;s body 
only managed to give headaches to the divinities in the room. &quot;Well, 
that was unexpected,&quot; Zeus commented as he blinked rapidly to clear 
the afterimages. 

&quot;Probably a backlash of power after being sealed for so long,&quot; Hades 
said as he looked at the dark figure standing behind his avatar. 
&quot;Setsuna, are you alright?&quot; 

&quot;I will be, my lord,&quot; she replied, not exactly sure if she really 
would be. She sighed quietly and leaned back against the skeletal form 
that was holding her. She had known who he was the moment she felt his 
presence behind her, shielding her from the worst of the shockwave 
with his shroud. 

Aphrodite looked at the servants of Hades and let a soft smile touch 
her lips. &quot;You have interesting timing, Charon,&quot; she said. &quot;Knowing 
what that energy did to me, I have no doubt that you just saved 
Setsuna&#39;s life. She still looks a bit shaken to me, so perhaps you 
should both return to the Underworld for a time. Unless your master 
requires anything further from his avatar,&quot; she said as she glanced at 
Hades. 

&quot;We need to have an extensive talk,&quot; Hades said as he observed Charon 
and Susan, &quot;But that can wait until she&#39;s well-rested. Until then, I 
think I will be rather busy cleaning up this mess. Charon, see to her 
comfort then return to your duties.&quot; 

Both the succubus and the demigod bowed to their master before Charon 
plane-shifted them both into a remote lair deep in the lowest levels 
of the Underworld. Once the shift was completed, he released his hold 
on her and took a few steps back, gazing at her carefully. 

Susan turned around and returned the gaze, a soft smile forming on her 
lips. &quot;You have my sincerest thanks for your help, my lord,&quot; she said 
softly as she laid her staff against the wall. 

The infamous Boatsman of the River Styx said nothing. He was close to 
seven feet tall and appeared to be nothing more than a skeleton 
enshrouded in a black cloak. Two fiery red pinpoints of light burned 
in the empty sockets of his skull, a sight to inspire fear in even the 
most stout of hearts. 

&quot;I would think that we are beyond the need to convey thanks,&quot; he 
finally said. His jaw never moved, but the powerfully deep voice 
emerged from within the depths of his hood. 

&quot;You have my thanks nonetheless,&quot; Susan replied. 

The silence stretched on again as they carefully regarded each other, 
Susan&#39;s face not betraying any emotion or thought and Charon&#39;s face 
unable to show any. &quot;I thought your soul was lost,&quot; he finally said. 

Susan sighed and ran her fingers through her hair. &quot;Not lost so much 
as misplaced in The Dark for a thousand years. It takes more than 
physical death for my soul to be lost, you know,&quot; she added, knowing 
full well that he was every bit as aware of her soul&#39;s nature as she 
was. 

It was another full minute before Charon spoke. &quot;I&#39;m glad you could 
return here,&quot; he said. 

Susan smiled. She knew that Charon was hardly the talkative type and 
was even less so when it came to admitting to personal feelings. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad to be here,&quot; she replied. &quot;And if it wasn&#39;t for your timely 
intervention, my return would have been decidedly short-lived. If you 
don&#39;t mind my asking, why did you show up at the Portal?&quot; 

The silence stretched on longer than expected. &quot;Come now, Charon, 
surely you had a reason for taking a break from your duties,&quot; she 
prodded, knowing that the demigod very rarely delegated the task of 
ferrying the souls of the dead across the River Styx to one of his 
minions, even if only for a momentary respite. &quot;Not that I&#39;m 
ungrateful that you did, I&#39;m merely curious.&quot; 

It seemed an eternity had passed before his voice emerged from his 
hood. &quot;I wanted to see you,&quot; he said simply. 

Susan blinked. &quot;You surprise me, Charon. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d 
think that you were trying to say you missed me.&quot; 

Another eternity passed before he slowly reached out and cupped her 
face in his hand. A brief and nearly silent rumble emerged from his 
chest, almost as if he had stopped himself from speaking. With an 
equally quiet sigh, he wrapped his other arm around her and held her 
close to him. 

She closed her eyes and returned the embrace, ignoring the icy feeling 
of his skeletal form pressing against her flesh. She knew he could 
summon a more corporeal form when he desired, surrounding the bones 
with a layer of muscle and flesh, but that the effort was rather 
taxing and could only be maintained for a few hours at a time. As a 
result, he only assumed his &#39;softer&#39; form for special occasions. 

So he did miss me, she thought as she deliberately avoided thinking 
about the chain of events that took place when she first learned he 
could assume a human form. Instead, she wondered about the 
implications of his apparent fondness for her and what the future 
might hold if she were to pursue the idea to the fullest extent. 

&quot;You should return to the other avatars,&quot; he said after a period of 
time had passed. The low rumble of his deep voice make his rib cage 
vibrate against her breasts, sending an electric thrill running 
through the rest of her body. 

&quot;I thought Hades said for you to see to my comfort,&quot; she said softly 
as she pressed herself harder against him. Desire started to well up 
in her as her body responded almost automatically to the accidental 
stimulation. She knew it wasn&#39;t because she needed sexual release, but 
because was deeply touched by Charon&#39;s unspoken affection for her. 

The boatsman hummed quietly to himself for several seconds, the 
vibration of his ribs drastically increasing Susan&#39;s state of arousal. 
&quot;I don&#39;t think he meant that kind of comfort,&quot; he replied as his hands 
lightly traced the edges of her wings. 

It took her a great deal of effort not to moan. The taut skin and 
rock- hard muscles of her wings were rather rough and leathery, just 
like the wings of any other succubus. However, unlike the other 
succubi, Susan&#39;s wings were very sensitive and the gentlest touch in 
the right places was more than enough to light the fires of her 
passion. 

The sound of gentle laughter interrupted her attempts at controlling 
her demonic desires. &quot;Forgive me, Setsuna, I didn&#39;t mean to be teasing 
you like this,&quot; he said with an obvious smile in his voice as his 
hands moved down to the small of her back. 

The sensation of his ribs moving with his laughter merely aroused her 
all more. &quot;Liar,&quot; she whimpered softly, knowing that he knew full well 
what he was doing to her. The thing that made it worse was that she 
was enjoying the feelings as much as he was, and he knew it. 

A muted but high-pitched screeching sound filled the room as a fire 
bat flew into the room, its wings engulfed the bright flames of 
hellfire. Charon made a grunting sound as he held his hand up, keeping 
it away from Susan&#39;s body. The bat immediately zeroed in on his hand 
and fluttered over, making an upside-down landing on his wrist-bone. 
Susan could feel the heat of the flames across her back and wings 
before the hellfire vanished as the bat&#39;s wings came to a standstill. 

The bat quickly chittered a message to Charon and shifted uneasily 
from foot to foot. The boatsman made no obvious reply, but after a 
moment the bat screeched in acknowledgement and immediately began 
flapping its wings again. The hellfire returned with a soft whoosh and 
a blast of heat as the bat became airborne and flew away, disappearing 
from both sight and sound after a few seconds of flight. 

Susan sighed heavily. &quot;Let me guess, you have to return to the River 
at once,&quot; she said as she struggled to control her rampant desires. 

&quot;Duty calls,&quot; he replied as he released his hold on her and stepped 
back. 

She sighed again and looked away as she gave in to the impulse to pout 
for a few seconds. She felt his touch on her cheek and turned back to 
face him, her hand coming up to cover his. 

&quot;We will meet again,&quot; he said quietly, his voice echoing slightly in 
his hollow chest. &quot;Soon.&quot; 

&quot;Is that a promise?&quot; she asked as she looked into the fierce pinpoints 
of his unholy eyes, wishing she could see some emotion, any emotion, 
in their fiery depths. The silence seemed to last forever in Susan&#39;s 
mind before she heard him speak. 

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; he replied quietly. &quot;I will see you later, Setsuna,&quot; the 
demigod said as he withdrew his hand from hers and departed the 
chamber. 

Susan closed her eyes and listened to the nearly inaudible footsteps 
as they slowly faded from her demonic hearing. She knew his role as 
the Boatsman of the River Styx was as demanding as it was crucial to 
the function of the Underworld, and how difficult it was for him to 
gain even a moment&#39;s reprieve from his ceaseless duties. She harbored 
no doubt, however, that he would keep his promise and see her again in 
the not-too-distant future. 

Her desires forgotten, she stood alone in the room and thought once 
more about the nature of her relationship with the demigod, trying to 
forget about the past and focusing more on the present. I&#39;ve been gone 
for a millenium, and yet he still showed me something deeper than mere 
fondness, she thought. Countless demonesses have sought him as a 
consort, and he could have had any of them if he so desired. And 
yet.... 

Susan abruptly shook her head to clear her mind of the thought, not 
daring to even consider the possibilities for now. Who knows, she 
thought with a mental shrug as she picked up her staff. Had anyone 
else been in the room at the time, they would have noticed that the 
staff had been picked up from a decidedly different spot than where it 
had been laid down. 

She paused ever so briefly as a tingle ran through the tips of her 
fingers when she touched the staff. The sensation was like a 
phantasmal caress of an old lover, comforting and familiar yet exotic 
at the same time. It was like that every time she touched the staff, 
and as always she was reminded of the burden she was condemned to bear 
as the Guardian of Time. 

Making sure she had a secure grip, she focused her mind on the staff 
and tapped into its energies. She was immediately enveloped in a 
glowing nimbus of light as she was briefly drawn into the flow of 
Time, travelling the currents as a fish swims through water. The 
journey lasted only for an instant in her perception before she 
emerged from the cosmic flow in an entirely different location, 
accompanied by another display of temporal energy. 

Alex was sitting on the ground and leaning against the same rock Megan 
had made her appearance on. Michelle was sitting next to her, leaning 
against the blonde and absently stroking the ball of gray fur curled 
up in her lap. They were clearly occupied, however, as Alex was in the 
process of giving her lover yet another passionate kiss, one hand 
gently kneading her breasts through the aquamarine gown. 

The brief flash of temporal energy was more than sufficient to 
announce Susan&#39;s arrival. Both humans quickly turned their heads to 
look at the sudden disturbance while Myst&#39;s ears perked up 
reflexively. Susan decided from the Shinma&#39;s reaction that she had 
been paying very little attention to Alex and Michelle&#39;s somewhat 
intimate activity. 

&quot;I see you&#39;ve managed to keep her calm during my absence,&quot; Susan 
observed as she gave Alex a knowing look. &quot;I apologize for my sudden 
disappearance,&quot; she said as she held up a hand to forestall the 
expected deluge of questions from her friends, &quot;But believe me when I 
say I had no choice and that it was for a very good reason.&quot; 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Alex demanded as hastily withdrew her hands from 
rather familiar territory and scrambled to her feet. Michelle started 
to get up as well, but seemed to be distinctly uneasy about something. 

&quot;I had to do a few cosmic errands as well as get this fixed,&quot; Susan 
said as she showed them the reforged Key to Time. It was fashioned out 
of an unusual type of metal, seeming to be both purple and silver in 
color at the same time. An intricate series of protrusions and ridges 
adorned the base of the staff, looking like the pattern on a key 
designed to fit a very complicated lock. The top of the staff had been 
split into two and curved back in on itself, forming a broad 
heart-shaped loop decorated with a pair of large red rubies and 
countless other tiny, glittering gemstones. 

Myst&#39;s eyes went wide as she sensed the power contained in the staff. 
&quot;What is that?&quot; she asked, more than slightly awed and wary of the 
vibes of energy she was feeling. 

&quot;It&#39;s something important to the structure of the universe, or so 
we&#39;ve been told,&quot; Alex said hastily, trying to forestall what she 
suspected would be a rather lengthy lecture on the origin and purpose 
of the staff. &quot;She can give you a better description later, but right 
now we&#39;ve got a problem.&quot; 

Susan frowned. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked as she glanced around the ruins 
of the Kingdom, trying to see any obvious source of trouble. 

&quot;There&#39;s something here,&quot; Michelle blurted out, hugging Myst tightly 
in an effort to remain calm. &quot;I don&#39;t know what, but something is 
here. I can feel it.&quot; 

The frown on Susan&#39;s face deepened. She knew that Michelle was not the 
bravest of people when confronted with an unknown, but usually Alex&#39;s 
presence was enough to keep her nerves somewhat calm. She also knew, 
or at least had a suspicion, that Michelle possessed an awareness of 
her surroundings that worked on the subconscious level. Such an innate 
sense was exceedingly rare for a human to possess and Michelle gave no 
indication that she even knew she had such a gift. 

Something&#39;s bothering her, she thought, and whatever it was not only 
rattled her hard enough that Alex can&#39;t keep her calm, it is also 
something that everyone else missed as well, including myself. 
However.... 

&quot;Talk to us, Sue,&quot; Alex said cautiously as she noticed Susan&#39;s 
expression shifting from thoughtfulness to concentration. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; 

The succubus ignored her as she closed her eyes and extended her 
demonic senses outward in a series of ripples. She immediately 
detected the auras around the three life-forms standing near her as 
well as the faint traces of a fourth that had been present not too 
long ago. That probably was Megan, she reasoned as she continued to 
expand her senses. She realized after a few seconds of concentration 
that she was beginning to detect a very faint and hollow echo of an 
aura not too far away. 

&quot;Myst,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;Can you sense auras?&quot; 

The kitten blinked and leapt out of Michelle&#39;s arms. She made a face 
as her landing kicked up a cloud of dust and she closed her eyes, her 
whiskers twitching as she extended her own senses outward. &quot;I can&#39;t 
sense very far because the fuzz is rather thick,&quot; she said after a few 
moments. 

&quot;What fuzz?&quot; Alex said warily as she glanced around, absently placing 
a comforting hand on Michelle&#39;s shoulder. &quot;What are you talking about 
now?&quot; 

&quot;If a soul isn&#39;t claimed when the body dies, it will drift around the 
immediate area on the Astral winds,&quot; Susan explained as she tried to 
focus on the faint echo she was sensing. She frowned as the echo 
seemed to begin moving, but she wasn&#39;t entirely sure if it wasn&#39;t a 
distorted echo from the spectral fuzz in the area. 

&quot;And...?&quot; Alex prompted after a few seconds of silence. 

&quot;However, if a soul is allowed to spend too much time drifting, it 
will eventually be absorbed by the Astral plane and thus be lost 
forever. When it is lost in such a fashion, it leaves behind an astral 
imprint of itself as it is drawn into the Astral plane. That imprint 
is seen as a somewhat foggy echo when one is searching for auras and 
it tends to obscure other auras in the immediate vicinity.&quot; 

&quot;So you refer to the memories of lost souls as fuzz?&quot; Alex asked with 
a frown. &quot;How charming.&quot; 

Susan whirled around angrily. &quot;Do you think I like it? Looking around 
and sensing little more than a personal and very painful reminder of 
the battle that took place in this kingdom? Countless lives were lost 
on that day, and while that in itself is tragic, it pales in 
comparison to the realization that their souls are lost as well. Do 
you have any idea how much it hurts to imagine it? Do you know what 
such a loss means to one who has a duty to see that the souls of the 
dead are taken to the gates of the Underworld?&quot; 

Michelle started cowering behind Alex, unsure of what had brought on 
the sudden display of Susan&#39;s demonic temperment. Alex, on the other 
hand, had no one else to hide behind and did her best to weather 
Susan&#39;s fury. Myst was occupied trying to concentrate on something she 
had just sensed while giving serious consideration to the idea of 
finding a place to hide until Susan had calmed down. 

&quot;I knew a great number of those people, Alex,&quot; the succubus continued, 
&quot;I knew them well, and I knew their families well. Very, very few 
people deserve such a fate as to have their souls become lost for 
eternity, and no one.... not a single soul within the boundaries of 
the Moon Kingdom should have been lost.&quot; 

&quot;Susan....&quot; Myst said. 

&quot;What about those two punks?&quot; Alex replied, trying to keep herself 
from cowering as well. &quot;You know which ones I&#39;m talking about.&quot; 

Susan said nothing for a moment as she fought to rein in her anger and 
regain her composure. &quot;After Rei and I reaved their souls from their 
bodies, I personally took them into Underworld,&quot; she said in a soft, 
low-pitched voice. &quot;I was there when they were Judged and damned. You 
have my personal assurance that they are now suffering and suffering 
greatly for their deeds.&quot; 

&quot;Susan....&quot; Myst said again as she started to back up, staring into 
the air at something she could sense but not see. 

Susan turned around to look and immediately felt the tiny hairs on the 
back of her neck stand up. A faint chill began to surround the area a 
few seconds later, a chill that she recognized at once. While there 
were many things that could add a chill to the air, none were as 
distinct as the presence of the wandering souls of the dead. 

Michelle whimpered quietly and latched onto Alex with a death-grip. 
Alex frowned at the unexpected chill and shivered lightly. &quot;Whoa, what 
gives?&quot; she asked as she tried to comfort her disturbed friend. &quot;Sue, 
did you turn off the heater or something?&quot; 

&quot;I believe we have company,&quot; Susan said quietly as she adjusted her 
grip on her staff and concentrated. What she sensed as a faint echo 
before could now be discerned as a very weak but definite aura that 
was drawing closer to the group. 

&quot;Company?&quot; Alex said, blinking in surprise. She quickly glanced around 
but failed to see what Susan and Myst were sensing and what had been 
upsetting Michelle. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me that. Haven&#39;t we had enough 
surprises for one afterlife?&quot; 

Susan said nothing as she stared out into the air. The source of the 
aura had stopped moving and was only a few feet away from her. 
Strange, she thought as she focused her demonic senses on the faded 
aura, it almost feels.... familar. Like I should know who it is.... 

&quot;It&#39;s here, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Michelle asked softly, her voice on the verge 
of cracking. She was trembling now as she continued to hold Alex&#39;s arm 
in a grip that threatened to cut off blood circulation. 

&quot;There!&quot; Myst yelped as she leapt back, her red eyes wide and her gray 
fur sticking straight out. Everyone tensed as a spectral mist began to 
form and coalesce into a humanoid figure. The process only lasted for 
an instant before the mist vanished and a ghostly figure stood before 
them. 

Susan blinked hard. &quot;Impossible,&quot; she breathed as she recognized the 
long, dark hair and exotic beauty of one of her fellow Sailor Scouts. 
&quot;Aria?&quot; Behind her, she heard both Alex and Michelle gasping as they 
too recognized the spectral image. 

The spirit of Lady Mars nodded her head once in slow motion, her 
facial expression showing signs of extreme weariness. Her beauty 
hadn&#39;t changed, but her eyes, once a bottomless shade of black, were 
now a featureless black that seemed to be sparked with the light of 
distant stars. Susan briefly glanced at the inhuman eyes and, for a 
moment, could have sworn she had been staring into the depths of the 
cosmos. 

The strain of making herself visible to the living seemed to overwhelm 
her and she collapsed to her knees. Susan immediately rushed foward to 
try to help her, and nearly cried out in pain as her hand passed 
through the spectral form, sending a deep chill through her flesh. 

&quot;Aria, can you speak to me?&quot; Susan asked as she knelt as close to Lady 
Mars as she dared. It was almost incomprehensible how a soul could 
resist the lure of the Astral plane for a thousand years as well as 
retain both the sanity and willpower to manifest itself to others. 

Her lips moved, but she made no sound that anyone could be heard. 
Susan shook her head slowly. &quot;I can&#39;t hear you, Aria. Speak slowly and 
I can try reading your lips,&quot; Susan said. Lady Mars seemed to sigh for 
a moment before she tried speaking again. Again no sound could be 
heard, but this time Susan was able to read her lips and understand 
her meaning. 

&quot;This is spooky,&quot; Alex muttered quietly as she bent down and picked up 
Myst. The kitten hadn&#39;t been expecting such a move and nearly clawed 
Alex in surprise. She sighed quietly and resigned herself to put up 
with Alex&#39;s rapid and nervous stroking of her gray fur. 

I don&#39;t have much time left, Susan thought as she watched Lady Mars&#39;s 
lips move. The Princess and four others of her court are alive, and 
the Imperium Silver Crystal still stands. They were here not too long 
ago, but how or why I don&#39;t know. 

&quot;She&#39;s alive,&quot; Susan whispered as tears threatened to flow. &quot;Alex, 
she&#39;s alive. The Princess is alive, on Earth.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; both Alex and Michelle demanded. Michelle turned her head to 
look up at the blue planet floating in the sky and began to cry 
silently with joy. &quot;Susan, how&#39;s that possible?&quot; 

&quot;I suppose we&#39;ll find out once we find her,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;Aria says 
that four others of her court are with her as well.&quot; 

&quot;Well what the hell are we waiting for, then? Let&#39;s get our butts over 
to Earth and start looking!&quot; Alex said as she tried to loosen 
Michelle&#39;s grip and restore some circulation to her arm. 

&quot;In a few minutes, Alex,&quot; Susan replied as she turned her attention 
back to the spirit of Lady Mars. The succubus blinked as she realized 
that Lady Mars&#39;s spectral state was becoming more and more translucent 
with each passing moment. &quot;Aria, try to stay with us just a little 
longer.&quot; 

Lady Mars slowly shook her head, her features showing she was 
teetering on the brink of exhaustion. Tired, she tried to speak. I 
don&#39;t know why I fought this long to remain in the Kingdom, fought the 
pain of being alone for countless eternities. But now.... I need to 
rest. So tired.... 

&quot;Aria, don&#39;t go,&quot; Susan said. &quot;I can take you with us to Earth, and 
you can have your eternal rest with the Imperium Silver Crystal once 
we find the Princess. Please, just hold on a little longer.&quot; 

I don&#39;t know if I can, Lady Mars replied as she closed her eyes. Her 
hair suddenly stirred as if an unfelt breeze was drifting by and the 
strain became more pronounced on her face. You have no idea how tiring 
these past few centuries have been, how tempting it is to just relax 
for a moment and go with the wind.... 

&quot;Is your daughter also with the Princess?&quot; Susan asked quietly. 

Lady Mars&#39;s eyes opened, their spectral depths momentarily startling 
Susan again. Yes, she is, she said after a moment. She sighed quietly 
and then added, I know what you&#39;re going to say, Lady Pluto. Yes, I 
want to see my daughter one more time. 

&quot;Then I will hold your soul inside me until I can deliver it to her 
and the Princess,&quot; Susan said softly. Lady Mars nodded and Susan 
leaned forward, ignoring the icy chill as she brushed her lips against 
the spectral image and concentrated. She waited until she felt the 
faint tingle in her lips as she tapped into the soul before she slowly 
began to inhale. 

Alex blinked hard as the spectral form of Lady Mars was suddenly 
broken into tiny particles of mist that was inhaled by the succubus. 
As she watched, a glowing blue sigil began to take form on Susan&#39;s 
shoulder. A memory suddenly bubbled up from the depths of her mind and 
she shuddered. 

&quot;Oh, no....&quot; Michelle said quietly from behind the blonde as she too 
remembered seeing something similar before. &quot;Alex!&quot; 

&quot;I know, love,&quot; Alex replied soothingly. &quot;This is only a temporary 
thing and she&#39;s not going to use it. I hope,&quot; she added. 

Susan finished absorbing Lady Mars&#39;s soul and slowly stood up, flexing 
her arm experimentally and casting a glance at the soul rune tattooed 
on her bare shoulder. &quot;Such power she has,&quot; she said quietly. She 
studied her hand as she slowly curled her fingers and made a fist. 

Everyone blinked as her fist suddenly was engulfed in fire, the flames 
burning quite hot yet leaving her skin untouched. She glanced up at 
the looks on the faces of her friends and let the fire vanish into 
nothingness. &quot;Are you three alright?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;You said you wouldn&#39;t use those.... things,&quot; Michelle said, extremely 
upset at the turn of events. &quot;You promised you wouldn&#39;t.&quot; 

Susan cast a glance at the soul rune. &quot;This is the only way I can 
carry her soul with us. And I&#39;m not going to use her powers, Michelle. 
She&#39;s far too weak to survive for very long, even in this form.&quot; 

Myst frowned in confusion, not understanding in the least what was 
going on between the three avatars. &quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; she said 
slowly. 

&quot;It&#39;s a long, complicated, and evil story,&quot; Alex said, speaking before 
Susan had a chance to say anything. &quot;And if it&#39;s all the same with 
you, I&#39;d rather not listen to her talk about those damned things 
again. Besides, we&#39;ve more important things to do, like finding a 
certain Princess.&quot; 

&quot;Is she really alive after all this time?&quot; Michelle asked, casting a 
nervous glance at the glowing sigil on Susan&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;Aria thinks so,&quot; Susan said as she adjusted her grip on her staff. 
&quot;And that is good enough for me. Let&#39;s go,&quot; she said as she held out 
her staff. 

&quot;Where to?&quot; Alex said as she reached out to touch the staff. 

&quot;Aria said that the Princess had been briefly sent here by the power 
of the Imperium Silver Crystal,&quot; the succubus replied as she made sure 
Michelle also got a grip on the staff. &quot;As for where from, she thinks 
it might have been from the ancient island kingdom on the far eastern 
coast. The kingdom itself is pretty much destroyed in this era, but it 
still exists somewhat.&quot; 

Michelle nodded. &quot;So where do we start?&quot; 

&quot;In the heart of that empire, in the city they call Tokyo,&quot; Susan said 
as she concentrated on the staff. The staff hummed to itself for an 
instant before they were enveloped in a shroud of temporal energy and 
vanished without a trace. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Darian blinked and looked up from the magazine he was reading. He had 
noticed that Dyvach had gotten unusually busy in the past hour, making 
several trips between the stairwell and the remaining pair of 
unoccupied rooms in the residential wing. However, the purpose of such 
activity was presently beyond him and he finally gave in to his 
simmering curiosity. 

&quot;Hey, Dyvach?&quot; he asked. The weaver paused it&#39;s task and gave him a 
questioning chime. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be nosy or anything, but what 
exactly are you doing?&quot; 

Dyvach replied with a complicated series of chimes, sounding to 
Darian&#39;s ear like hailstones bouncing off of a xylophone. &quot;I.... 
didn&#39;t catch a word of that,&quot; he said sheepishly. 

The weaver made a disgruntled sound to itself that Darian understood 
quite clearly and quickly scuttled off to the residential wing. It 
returned a few moments later and climbed onto the couch next to him, 
curling its many legs beneath its carapace and turning a faint purple 
color. 

It chimed a single word at Darian and he nodded. &quot;Cleaning, I 
understand now. Didn&#39;t mean to interrupt your work.&quot; It made a flat 
chime in response and added another single-word chime. 

Darian blinked. He considered himself to be somewhat knowledgable when 
it came to the more &#39;simple&#39; chimes of the weaver language, although 
he would readily admit he only understood a fraction of what Tolaris 
or even Ami had learned about the language. However, there were times 
in which he had his doubts that he was hearing Dyvach correctly. 

&quot;Guests?&quot; he repeated. Dyvach chimed an affirmative and Darian blinked 
again. &quot;Are you saying you&#39;re cleaning because we&#39;re going to have 
guests? No, wait, keep it to the one-word chimes, please,&quot; he said 
wearily as Dyvach started to chime away at it&#39;s usual rapid-fire pace. 

&quot;Guests, soon, friends,&quot; he repeated as Dyvach slowed down 
considerably. &quot;Umm, does Tolaris know about this?&quot; Dyvach hesitated 
for a moment before it grumbled quietly to itself and made a single 
multi-harmonic chime. 

Darian had to strain his brain to translate the sound. I think that 
was one of the ones Ami had trouble with, he thought. She said it 
meant both &quot;not yet&quot; and &quot;too soon&quot; about the same subject, but that 
she thought it was in two different contexts. Talk about your 
headaches.... 

The weaver interrupted his train of thought with a string of 
slow-paced chimes, most of which he was easily able to translate if 
not immediately comprehend. &quot;Whoa, wait a second,&quot; he said slowly. 
&quot;You want me to do what with a towel? I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said as Dyvach 
grumbled in mild frustration. 

&quot;Say this one word at a time.... Okay, okay, I&#39;ll save the why part 
until you&#39;re done.... Umm, grab a few towels.... and put them.... 
where? OH, you mean my jeep! Okay, put the towels in my jeep, and.... 
Luna? You want me to go get Luna? Sure, but.... Wait, you just lost me 
on that. Take her where? Bath? No, not that, then.... pool? A big 
pool.... in the city? Wait, do you mean the lake?&quot; 

Darian sat back and rubbed his eyes for a moment while Dyvach chimed 
with happiness. &quot;Let me try this from the top, my friend,&quot; he said 
slowly. &quot;You want me to put a bunch of towels in my jeep, then go get 
Luna and take her to the artificial lake in the center of the city. Am 
I right?&quot; The resulting cheer from the oversized crystalline spider 
definitely needed no translation. &quot;Okay, now comes the fun part.... 
WHY?&quot; 

He blinked hard when Dyvach made a strangled noise as it rolled off 
the couch, landing on its back with its legs curled up in a classic 
&#39;dead spider&#39; pose. Very slowly and patiently, it repeated what it 
said when the cleaning question first arose. 

The full realization hit Darian with the force of a baseball bat being 
slammed into the back of his head. &quot;Dyvach, who&#39;s coming? I know you 
said guests and that they&#39;re friends, but who are they? I mean, are 
they from the Negaverse, and if so, is Tolaris aware of this?&quot; 

The weaver made a grouchy noise as it flipped back over and reoriented 
itself. It took a deep breath tried to explain things as best it could 
while keeping the vocabulary down to a level Darian could understand. 

He let out a sigh of frustration. &quot;This isn&#39;t working, Dyvach, I can&#39;t 
make sense of what you&#39;re saying. It&#39;s not your fault,&quot; he added as 
the weaver turned a bright green color, &quot;I just can&#39;t translate sounds 
well.&quot; 

Dyvach suddenly froze, the colors of its carapace shifting rapidly 
through the visible spectrum before finally settling on a blotchy mix 
of dark blue, orange, and neon yellow. It then began to chitter 
excitedly to itself at a very rapid pace while tugging hard on 
Darian&#39;s leg. 

Darian blinked. &quot;I hope you&#39;re not going to throw up or something.... 
Okay, okay, I&#39;ll follow you, you can let go of me now,&quot; he said as he 
got to his feet and was almost literally dragged halfway across the 
cathedral. &quot;So what&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked as he followed the weaver 
into the computer room. 

It merely motioned for him to sit in the chair while it picked up the 
crystalline keyboard and set it on the floor. It then sat back on half 
of its legs and used the other half to type away at a furious pace, 
accessing the mainframe with mind-boggling speed. 

Okay, Darian thought as he sat down in the chair and tried to figure 
out what Dyvach was up to. Boy, and I thought Ami could type fast. Of 
course, she only has two hands as opposed to how many legs? he 
thought, trying to get a count of the number of limbs in motion. They 
were moving faster than he could follow and he finally settled for 
estimating there where somewhere between six and eight legs on the 
keyboard at once. 

He refocused on the screen as Dyvach suddenly quit typing and sat 
back, watching the line of characters slowly appear on the display. 
Darian blinked as he realized that Dyvach had filled up the keyboard 
buffer and was waiting for the computer to catch up with what it had 
already typed in. &quot;Hey,&quot; he said as he studied the spidery denizen 
text scrolling across the screen, &quot;I think I can read some of that. 
Can you....&quot; 

&quot;Can you understand me now, your Highness?&quot; the computer said in a 
flat monotone voice, the text turning from green to blue as it 
translated each word into verbal English. Darian leapt out of the 
chair as if something had bitten his backside. He let loose with a 
brief burst of profanity and added, &quot;What did you do?!&quot; 

Dyvach made a curious tinkling noise as it began to type. &quot;I accessed 
the new translator program. I do not know why I did not think of this 
earlier,&quot; the computer replied. 

Darian&#39;s eyes were nearly double their usual size. &quot;Is THAT what 
Serena was babbling about when she said Ami had taught it to talk?&quot; 

There was a slight delay between Dyvach&#39;s typing and the computer 
voice translation of what was typed. &quot;I do not know what the Princess 
said, but I do know that this computer program was written by the 
mistress.&quot; 

Princess? Mistress? he thought as his brain threatened to shut down 
from too much information at once. &quot;Hang on, you&#39;re confusing me 
here....&quot; 

&quot;There is not much time for me to explain. You must take Luna and 
three large towels to the west edge of the lake,&quot; the emotionless 
voice said from the speaker. &quot;There you will meet the rest of the 
Princess&#39;s royal court.&quot; 

&quot;Royal court? Are they from the Moon Kingdom?&quot; Darian asked. 

Dyvach made a frustrated sound as it typed furiously. &quot;I only know 
what I see in what you would term a daydream. If this is not acted 
upon, it will change and I will not know what will happen next. Take 
the towels from the linen closet outside and go get Luna. I will 
explain when we have time.&quot; 

Darian paused to briefly consider the situation. Here I am, sitting in 
the middle of a room surrounded by technology that came from another 
world, I&#39;m being told by an oversized crystal spider to take some 
towels and a talking cat from the moon to go meet people who probably 
aren&#39;t expecting me, and all of this is based on something that 
happened in a daydream. 

&quot;Oh, what the hell,&quot; he grumbled to himself as he stood up and walked 
out into the corridor. Of all the things I&#39;ve done since I&#39;ve 
discovered my past reincarnation, this has got to be one of the 
strangest, he thought as he got three fluffy towels from the linen 
closet and made his way towards the front door of the cathedral. 

He chuckled to himself as he tossed the towels in the back seat of his 
jeep and climbed in. Yeah, ranks up there with talking to a sentient 
being who looks like a seriously overgrown spider with a translucent 
shell that changes colors for whatever reason, playing chess with (and 
losing to) a completely different species of sentient being who looks 
like a five-foot owl that speaks with her mind instead of her voice, 
and waking up butt-naked in a different dimension next to a woman from 
yet another sentient alien species who just happens to be the queen of 
the whole planet. But you have to admit, not very many people get the 
chance to do stuff like that. That reminds me, I still owe Ra&#39;vel a 
rematch. Who taught her to play chess that well, anyway? 

Darian was almost at the end of the cathedral&#39;s gravel road when the 
thought popped back into his conscious mind. He immediately slammed on 
the brakes hard enough to create a geyser of gravel behind him and 
skidded to a halt. Wait.... when did I wake up next to Beryl? he 
thought as a wave of pure ice flooded his veins. He closed his eyes 
tightly and searched his memory of the only possible time he could 
have done such a thing. He remembered very little of the events 
surrounding his brainwashing by Queen Beryl&#39;s minions, but he was 
almost positive that he would remember something like THAT. 

I don&#39;t recall anything like that happening, but that memory had to 
have come from somewhere, he reasoned as he carefully resumed driving. 
He frowned as he thought about it. Was it a memory? he asked himself 
as he tried to remember the exact image that had popped up. It was 
like a phantom memory, something he thought he remembered doing but 
couldn&#39;t actually remember doing so. This is going to drive me nuts, 
he thought as he warily watched the road ahead of him. What I do 
remember is looking up from that stasis cylinder and nearly wetting 
myself at the sight of being surrounded by so many of Beryl&#39;s 
henchmen.... yeah, maybe that&#39;s what I was thinking of. I hope. 

He blinked as he felt his communicator start to vibrate in his pocket. 
I&#39;m glad they were able to talk Ami into adding a vibration setting to 
these things instead of just beeping, he thought as he pulled the 
communicator out and glanced at the flashing icon. Had a hard time 
explaining to the guys at work about this &#39;pager&#39; going off in the 
middle of the day all the time. 

He opened the ash tray and propped the communicator up at an angle in 
it before he opened the channel. &quot;You have interesting timing, 
Serena,&quot; he said, keeping one eye on the tiny screen and the other on 
the road. 

The image of Serena blinked. &quot;Oh? What&#39;d I do this time?&quot; 

Darian chuckled. &quot;Was just about to call you in a few moments.&quot; 

The blonde giggled. &quot;I guess we just know each other too well. Umm, I 
take it you&#39;re busy driving?&quot; 

He spared the monitor a half-second glance. &quot;Now that you mention it, 
I&#39;m on my way to your house as we speak. Where&#39;s Luna?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s here,&quot; Serena replied as she cast a puzzled glance off-screen. 

&quot;I need to pick her up and take her with me on a mission from Dyvach,&quot; 
he said as he changed lanes to pass an ancient truck. &quot;I&#39;m almost at 
your house now, so tell her to just get ready and I&#39;ll explain as we 
go.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll be at the front of the house,&quot; Luna said as she poked her head 
into the monitor&#39;s field-of-view. &quot;You said Dyvach asked you to do 
this?&quot; 

Darian sighed. &quot;Long story, Luna, but yes.&quot; 

Luna perked her ears up as she heard his jeep. &quot;I&#39;ll be with you in a 
moment,&quot; she said as she jumped down from the bed. Serena watched her 
leap out the window and scramble down the tree before she cast a 
questioning glance at the monitor. &quot;This isn&#39;t something we should 
alert the others about, is it?&quot; she asked hesitantly. 

&quot;Hang on,&quot; he said as he turned down Serena&#39;s street and slowed down. 
He found Luna perched on top of the mailbox and drove as close to the 
curb as he could. She easily leapt into the front seat next to him and 
he quickly turned the jeep around, heading into the heart of downtown 
Tokyo. 

&quot;Good evening,&quot; Luna said as she sat back and began to preen. 

&quot;Sorry to drag you out at this hour on such short notice, but I&#39;ve 
been told we&#39;re running against a clock of sorts,&quot; he replied. 

Luna chuckled. &quot;Well, it&#39;s not like I had a hot date tonight.&quot; 

Darian wisely decided to refrain from comment. &quot;Anyway, to answer your 
question, Serena.... Dyvach said I&#39;m going to be meeting some people 
he said were going to be guests at the cathedral, and that they were, 
quote, the rest of the Princess&#39;s royal court, end quote.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Luna and Serena said simultaneously. 

&quot;I&#39;m just the gopher boy on this one. I was told to grab three towels 
and Luna, and to take them to the west side of the lake,&quot; he explained 
as he drove down the street. &quot;And supposedly we&#39;re going to meet up 
with a few people who probably won&#39;t be expecting us, according to 
Dyvach. I know this sounds like an oddball plan, but after what 
Whisper said about it being precognitive.... well, worst that could 
happen is that it&#39;s wrong and I get to spend a romantic evening 
sitting on a pile of towels by the lake with Luna.&quot; 

&quot;Hey!&quot; Serena protested. 

He chuckled and smiled at the monitor. &quot;I&#39;m only teasing, Serena.&quot; 

Luna shrugged in typical feline fashion. &quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot; 

&quot;Luna!&quot; 

&quot;Anyway,&quot; he said slowly, trying to defuse Serena&#39;s momentary fit of 
jealousy. &quot;Get this.... Dyvach started typing on that mainframe 
computer and the computer started translating what he typed!&quot; 

&quot;See, I told you Ami did something to it,&quot; Serena said with a smile. 
&quot;I don&#39;t know how she did it, but she got it to start responding to 
whatever she says to it.&quot; 

Luna&#39;s ears perked up. &quot;A talking computer?&quot; 

&quot;The wonders of denizen technology,&quot; Darian said as he stopped at a 
red light. &quot;Five bucks says if she did it with the cathedral 
mainframe, she&#39;ll have her little toy computer talking inside of two 
weeks.&quot; 

Serena opened her mouth to say something when she suddenly glanced at 
something off-screen and her blue eyes widened. &quot;Hi, mom,&quot; she said as 
she quickly closed the connection. 

Darian just shook his head as he picked up his communicator, closed 
the channel on his end, and stuffed it back into his pocket. 
&quot;Sometimes it&#39;s easy to forget about her family,&quot; he said quietly as 
the light turned green and he began to accelerate. 

Luna nodded. &quot;You have no idea how many times I&#39;ve had to bite my 
tongue to keep myself from talking to her when other people are 
around. And having to go &#39;meow&#39; gets really old after awhile.&quot; 

&quot;Mmmmm,&quot; he said to himself as he made a right-turn and found a 
parking spot. &quot;Well, here we are,&quot; he said as he set the brake and 
turned off the engine. The edge of the lake was only a dozen yards in 
front of him, separated by a narrow expanse of sidewalk and a field of 
grass. Off in the distance was the gazebo that the romantics seemed to 
favor, himself included. Strangely enough, it was empty at the moment 
even though it was late at night and the weather was seasonally good. 

The black cat purred as she stretched. &quot;So now what?&quot; 

He shrugged helplessly. &quot;Your guess is as good as mine right now, 
Luna. Dyvach only said for me to bring you and the towels here. Didn&#39;t 
say anything about what to do once we arrived.&quot; 

Luna climbed up onto the dashboard and looked out across the surface 
of the artificial lake. &quot;Well, we could always....&quot; 

She was interrupted by a bright flash of light high over the water. 
The flash had barely begun to fade before there was a series of 
screams as several humanoid figures suddenly appeared and began to 
plummet towards the surface of the lake. 

Darian was scrambling out of the jeep when they splashed into the 
lake, the sound accompanied by a garbled curse that echoed quite 
clearly across the park. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to have a word with 
Dyvach,&quot; he muttered to himself as he ran to the edge of the railing 
and looked out at the water. 

Three heads broke the surface of the lake and immediately began to 
spit out the lungfuls of water they had accidentally inhaled. One 
quickly glanced around and gestured towards the nearest edge of the 
lake, which coincidentally happened to be where Darian was standing. 
All three appeared to be rather proficient swimmers and covered the 
distance in a very short time. 

&quot;Hey, are you alright?&quot; Darian yelled out as he ducked under the 
railing and held his hand out. 

A woman with close-cut blonde hair coughed loudly and grasped his 
hand. &quot;I&#39;ve &lt;cough&gt; had better &lt;cough&gt; days,&quot; she gasped as she hauled 
herself out of the water. She was wearing a white ballroom gown, and 
from the way it clung to her body it was obvious there wasn&#39;t much 
else beneath it. 

Next to them, a woman with dark green hair in a black gown reached up 
to grab the railing with one hand. Her other hand was holding onto the 
arm of a woman with aquamarine hair and wearing a matching color gown. 
With a grunt, she heaved the other woman up to the railing and pulled 
herself out of the water. &quot;Is everyone alright?&quot; she asked as she 
glanced at the blonde. 

&quot;I think so,&quot; she replied with a sour look. She suddenly blinked and 
quickly glanced around. &quot;Wait, where&#39;s Myst?&quot; 

The other woman blinked once before she whirled around and dove back 
into the water, swimming furiously out to the point where they had 
been dumped into the lake. She paused to search around before she dove 
beneath the water. 

Darian heard a sound behind him and glanced over his shoulder. Luna 
had managed to take the towels out of the jeep and was in the process 
of dragging them across the grass towards the group. &quot;Good thinking,&quot; 
he said as he made sure both women were safely out of the water before 
rushing over to pick up the towels. 

The woman with aquamarine hair coughed for a moment before she turned 
her head out to look at the lake. &quot;Where is she?&quot; she asked, casting a 
glance at her friend. 

A small geyser of water erupted as the woman burst forth from beneath 
the surface of the lake holding something in her hands. She quickly 
swam back towards the edge of the water and fairly heaved the object 
at the blonde before scrambling out herself. 

&quot;Here,&quot; Darian said as he wrapped a towel around the blonde&#39;s 
shoulders before passing a second one to the woman in aquamarine. 

&quot;You&#39;re a godsend,&quot; the blonde replied as she immediately wrapped the 
towel around the small gray bundle in her lap and began rubbing 
furiously. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Susan said as she accepted a towel from Darian. She began 
to dry herself before she froze and blinked, staring hard at him. 

Darian blinked at the unexpected attention and noticed that the woman 
in aquamarine was staring at him as well. &quot;Umm....&quot; he said slowly. 

&quot;Prince Darian?&quot; Michelle said incredulously. 

&quot;What?&quot; Alex said as her head whipped around. Her eyes became 
impossibly wide as she saw that Michelle was speaking the truth. 
&quot;Holy....&quot; she started to say, for once unable to finish her usual 
spate of profanity in surprise situations. 

&quot;Susan, is that you?&quot; Luna said in amazement as she stared at the 
familiar figure, her jaw hanging down to her knees. 

All three women turned their heads to look at the source of the voice 
and blinked. &quot;Luna!&quot; they chorused in near-unison. 

&quot;It is you!&quot; Luna said happily as she ran over to Susan. 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Susan replied as she knelt down and ran her fingers through 
Luna&#39;s dark fur, hardly believing her luck at finding her. Her 
priorities quickly reasserted themselves and she looked up sharply at 
the blonde. &quot;Alex, how&#39;s Myst doing?&quot; 

Alex was about to reply when there was an explosion of water from the 
ball of fur in her lap, followed by a spate of decidedly unhealthy 
coughing. The blonde glanced down and suddenly scrambled back with a 
yelp of surprise. 

Darian blinked and tried to see what startled her. He blinked again as 
he thought he saw an oozing mass of.... something inside the towel 
before it rippled slightly and a gray kitten poked her head out. She 
then proceeded to finish coughing the rest of the water out of her 
lungs, her red eyes giving Susan a baleful look. 

&quot;I&#39;d say she&#39;ll live,&quot; Susan commented to herself as she glanced over 
at Michelle. &quot;And are you alright?&quot; 

Michelle nodded sourly as she finished towelling the worst of the 
water off of her. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said as she wrung out the towel and 
made a face at the amount of water that splashed onto the grass. 

&quot;So, your Highness, long time no see,&quot; Alex said as she stood up and 
began to shake the water out of her hair. 

Darian blinked. &quot;Uh, I take it I&#39;m supposed to know you?&quot; he said 
slowly. 

The three women quit towelling themselves and gave him stunned looks. 
&quot;You mean you don&#39;t remember us?&quot; Susan asked curiously with a faint 
frown on her face. 

&quot;It&#39;s a very long story,&quot; Luna said as she walked over to examine 
Myst. &quot;He is Darian Chiba, the reincarnation of Prince Darian of 
Earth.&quot; 

&quot;Reincarnation?&quot; Susan said quietly. She then sighed and nodded. &quot;I 
see. Forgive me, your Highness. I am Susan Meiou, avatar of Pluto and 
the Queen&#39;s Chancellor. This is Alexis Ten&#39;ou, avatar of Uranus, and 
Michelle Kaiou, avatar of Neptune,&quot; she said, gesturing to each in 
turn. 

The blonde growled quietly. &quot;Call me Alex, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot; 

&quot;Umm, sure, no problem,&quot; Darian replied. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Luna asked as she began to preen the kitten. 

Myst jumped back and gave her a wide-eyed look. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; 

Luna blinked hard, surprised by Myst&#39;s unexpected reaction. &quot;I was 
just going to try to help get that water out of your fur,&quot; she said 
cautiously. 

&quot;Luna, Myst isn&#39;t a lunar cat,&quot; Susan explained as she wrung her towel 
out. &quot;She is a Shinma, a species of demon. She is an ally,&quot; she added 
as she noticed the look on Darian&#39;s face. 

&quot;Demon?&quot; he asked slowly, casting a wary glance at what appeared to be 
a lunar kitten. Luna also gave her a concerned look, slowly backing 
away from the Shinma. 

&quot;Relax, she&#39;s on our side, alright,&quot; Alex replied as she tossed her 
towel to Michelle and began to wring the water out of her gown. 
Michelle frowned lightly, wrapped one towel around her shoulders, and 
began to towel her friend off with the other one. 

&quot;Is the Princess alright?&quot; Susan asked Darian as she did her best to 
dry off her back. The shock of hitting the cold water had caused her 
to absorb her wings and revert to her human form. A distant part of 
her mind told her that the same shock also caused her to drop her 
staff and that it was probably at the bottom of the lake by now. She 
sent an empathic command toward the staff and felt it unobtrusively 
blend itself into the temporal flow of Time where she could get it 
later when she wished. 

&quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; Luna replied as she continued to look over Myst from a 
distance. &quot;In fact, all of them are fine. Ami, Rei, Leda, and Mina.... 
even Artemis is here, too.&quot; 

&quot;Artemis?&quot; Alex said as she looked up with a grin. &quot;Aw, that sour old 
furball is still kicking?&quot; 

&quot;Luna, I realize that we probably have a great deal to talk about,&quot; 
Susan said as she shook a few water droplets from her hair, &quot;But first 
we need to find a place we can stay for the night and get some dry 
clothes.&quot; 

Darian and Luna exchanged looks. &quot;Funny you should mention a place to 
stay,&quot; he said. &quot;I think someone saw you coming and made a few 
arrangements ahead of time, although I still don&#39;t know how the others 
are going to react to this one. Umm.... hang on a second,&quot; he added as 
he felt his communicator start to vibrate in his pocket again. 

&quot;Saw us coming?&quot; Susan echoed as she gave Luna a curious look. 

Luna sighed. &quot;As I said, it&#39;s a very long story.&quot; 

Darian frowned as he pulled out his communicator and saw the flashing 
icon. &quot;So it begins,&quot; he muttered as he thumbed the display on. &quot;I 
take it Dyvach woke you up?&quot; he said as the image appeared on the 
monitor. 

&quot;It did indeed,&quot; the image of Tolaris replied. &quot;And it also told me 
that we were going to be having a few guests in the very near future, 
as well as telling me you were on your way to pick them up.&quot; 

&quot;What the hell is that thing?&quot; Alex asked as she stepped over to 
Darian to peer at the communicator. &quot;And who are you talking to?&quot; 

&quot;You could say that,&quot; Darian said to Tolaris as he glanced at Alex. 
&quot;In fact, they&#39;re already here. Luna&#39;s with me and she knows them.&quot; 

&quot;I see,&quot; Tolaris said evenly. &quot;Do the other Sailor Scouts know?&quot; 

Darian sighed. &quot;We&#39;re working on that, but things happened too fast 
for us to really think this one through.&quot; 

Alex blinked. &quot;You&#39;re here to meet us, you bring us towels after we 
get dumped in the lake, and now you&#39;re saying this wasn&#39;t planned 
ahead of time?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t interrupt,&quot; Susan admonished her as she wrung her towel out 
once more and picked up Myst. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; she asked the kitten 
as she began to dry her off as best she could. 

&quot;Put me back,&quot; Myst grumbled. &quot;Just toss me back in The Dark. At least 
I knew how to deal with everything in there,&quot; she said as she gave up 
trying to assess the situation and submitted to being rubbed dry. 

Darian blinked as he felt a cool breeze start to blow past him and 
turned to look in the general direction of the cathedral. He wasn&#39;t at 
all surprised to see a mass of dark clouds slowly forming in the sky 
high over the grove of trees that hid the cathedral from sight. 

&quot;I take it this isn&#39;t sitting too well with you?&quot; Darian asked 
Tolaris. 

The Dragoon blinked. &quot;You could say that. Why do you ask?&quot; 

Darian smirked. &quot;Call it a gut instinct. That, and a storm front is 
rapidly developing over a nondescript part of the forest.&quot; 

Susan frowned as she glanced in the direction Darian was looking at. 
She noticed the storm clouds forming as well and felt a dark chill 
slowly creep down her spine. That&#39;s not a natural storm, she thought 
to herself. 

Darian almost dropped the communicator as Luna leapt up at him, using 
her claws to grab hold of his shirt and climbing higher until she 
could see into the communicator. &quot;Commander, we need to make a 
decision and fast. I know them personally and can attest that they are 
Sailor Scouts as well. They&#39;re also thoroughly soaked, and if we don&#39;t 
get them dried out soon they&#39;ll all catch cold.&quot; 

&quot;And Susan is not a nice person to deal with when she&#39;s got a 
headcold,&quot; Alex added loudly as she craned her head over Darian&#39;s 
shoulder. 

Tolaris frowned at the unexpected voice. &quot;Dyvach is being unusually 
insistent about this one for some reason. And seeing how we&#39;ve got 
everything prepared, you might as well bring them over here for the 
night. There will be a great deal to discuss in the morning, however, 
and everyone will need to be here.&quot; 

Darian nodded. &quot;Understood, but it might have to wait until 
afternoon.&quot; 

&quot;They have school, I know,&quot; Tolaris replied with a weary sigh. &quot;I&#39;ll 
go wake up Maze and the others so they know what to expect. And 
Darian? Don&#39;t make me regret any of this,&quot; he said and closed the 
channel. 

&quot;He seems like a happy camper,&quot; Alex commented. &quot;Who is he?&quot; 

Darian sighed. &quot;Tolaris is a good friend of the Sailor Scouts,&quot; he 
said as he pried Luna free from the front of his shirt and held her in 
a more comfortable position. &quot;He may be a little stiff at times, but 
you&#39;ll get used to him fairly quickly. Come on, everyone in the jeep,&quot; 
he said as he started walking towards the parked vehicle. 

Alex blinked. &quot;In the what?&quot; 

&quot;A type of surface vehicle,&quot; Susan explained as she followed him, 
making sure she stayed close to Michelle and Alex. She knew that they 
hadn&#39;t been paying much attention to their immediate surroundings and 
that the culture shock was only seconds away. &quot;It is powered by a 
combustion engine and is usually only driven on paved roads, although 
I believe that &#39;jeeps&#39; are also capable of being taken off-road as 
well.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; the blonde commented as she glanced around, blinked 
hard, and came to an abrupt halt. Michelle bumped into her and was 
about to say something when she too looked around and froze at what 
she was seeing. 

Darian noticed the girls&#39; state of shock and paused as well. &quot;Is there 
something wrong?&quot; he asked as he looked around for something amiss. 

&quot;Sue... what IS this?&quot; Alex said in utter awe and amazement. 

&quot;Welcome to twentieth-century Tokyo,&quot; Susan said as she looked around. 
&quot;As you can see, their level of technology has improved considerably 
since you were last on the planet.&quot; 

Darian blinked and exchanged curious glances with Luna. &quot;You mean to 
say you have no memory of what has happened since the end of the 
Silver Millenium?&quot; Luna asked cautiously. 

Susan shook her head sadly. &quot;It is, as you said, a very long story. 
The short explanation is that we&#39;ve been dead for the past thousand 
years and have only now been resurrected.&quot; 

&quot;Whhhaaaaaaat?&quot; Darian said in surprise, his eyes widening. 

&quot;Hey, are these the electric lights you were talking about?&quot; Alex said 
as she craned her head up to stare at a street light. 

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Michelle said at the same time, pointing to a car 
moving slowly in the distance. &quot;It looks like a rover, but it sounds 
different....&quot; 

&quot;Culture shock,&quot; Susan said with a smile as she gestured to her two 
companions. &quot;I suspect it will be quite awhile before you hear the end 
of the questions.&quot; 

Darian frowned as he set Luna on the hood of his jeep and began to 
clean out the back seats. &quot;They won&#39;t be the only one asking 
questions. Why is it they don&#39;t know about any of this, but you do?&quot; 
he asked Susan. 

&quot;I&#39;m a time-traveller,&quot; she explained. &quot;I mostly travelled between 
what you would call 200 BC and 2100 AD, and have a fairly extensive 
knowledge of the various cultures and socities between those times.&quot; 

Luna blinked. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s right....&quot; 

Susan frowned. &quot;Luna, how could you forget something like that?&quot; 

The black cat sighed heavily. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; she said quietly as 
she glanced away. &quot;So much gets lost after a thousand years.&quot; 

&quot;Time travel?&quot; Darian said incrediously. &quot;You mean, as in go back in 
time to see what happened, say, four hundred years ago?&quot; 

&quot;Cheer up, you&#39;ll get used to her talking about it all the time,&quot; Alex 
said as she continued to study the modern-era city. &quot;No pun intended,&quot; 
she added, winking at Michelle and eliciting a groan from her. 

Everyone blinked as Myst suddenly burst into a fit of sneezes. 
&quot;Perhaps we should worry about getting dry first,&quot; Susan suggested. 
&quot;The temperature is starting to drop and these towels have absorbed 
all the water they can, so it would be a good idea to find clean 
clothes before we do catch colds.&quot; 

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Alex replied. &quot;My tits are starting to freeze and having 
them showing through this gauzy excuse for a dress isn&#39;t helping 
matters. Of all the colors to pick, he just had to choose white,&quot; she 
muttered sourly as she tugged on her gown. The fabric pulled away from 
her skin easily, but quickly stuck again once she let go. She glanced 
up and caught Darian&#39;s reflexive gaze in her direction. &quot;Problem?&quot; she 
asked lightly, the corner of her lip curling up into a faint smile. 

Darian coughed to himself as he turned his attention back to his jeep, 
feeling the blush creeping up on his face. &quot;Come on, everyone in and 
make sure to buckle up,&quot; he said as he unlocked the doors. 

&quot;Oooo, what have we here?&quot; Alex said as she examined the jeep. 

&quot;You can look at it later,&quot; Susan chided as she moved past her and sat 
down in the front passenger seat, still rubbing Myst&#39;s damp fur. 
&quot;Right now, we have to get dried out and warmed up soon.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; Alex said with enough sarcasm to scorch a rock. 

Susan gave her an odd look. &quot;Unless you want to stay cold and wet.&quot; 

The blonde merely grumbled to herself as she climbed into the jeep and 
plopped into the back seat. Michelle shook her head as she climbed 
into the seat next to her and fastened the belt around her waist. 

&quot;Come on, Luna, unless you want to be a hood ornament,&quot; Darian said as 
he started the engine. He waited until Luna had jumped up from the 
hood to the rollbar and down into Michelle&#39;s lap before he shifted 
into reverse and began to back out. 

&quot;So, your Highness,&quot; Alex said casually as she glanced around the 
city, &quot;Where exactly are we going?&quot; 

Darian frowned lightly as he glanced at her in the rear-view mirror. 
&quot;There&#39;s a small cathedral hidden deep within a remote part of the 
forest at the edge of the city,&quot; he explained as he shifted gears and 
began to drive down the street. &quot;Luna can tell you more about the past 
history of it, but right now it&#39;s being used as a base by the Sailor 
Scouts and our allies.&quot; 

Susan glanced over at him. &quot;Allies like Tolaris?&quot; 

&quot;Exactly.&quot; 

&quot;You have yet to tell us about him,&quot; she said. 

Luna sighed quietly. &quot;They&#39;re going to have to know sooner or later,&quot; 
she said to Darian. &quot;And I&#39;d much rather they know now before they 
meet.&quot; 

&quot;Why do I get the feeling that you&#39;re about to tell us something that 
we probably won&#39;t like?&quot; Alex asked slowly as a chill ran down her 
spine. 

&quot;You want the short or the long version?&quot; Darian asked. 

&quot;The short version for now,&quot; Susan replied. 

&quot;Okay, in short, Tolaris and the others are from the Negaverse,&quot; 
Darian said simply. 

&quot;What?&quot; Alex, Michelle, and Susan said in unison, each voice tempered 
with a decidedly dangerous edge to it. 

&quot;You must understand a few things,&quot; Luna said quickly. &quot;None of them 
are old enough to have been a part of the invasion of the Moon 
Kingdom, and they have all been branded as traitors by the Negaverse 
for helping us.&quot; 

&quot;Wait, let me get this right,&quot; Alex said, her voice laced with steel. 
&quot;We&#39;re on our way to go meet with a few people from the Negaverse? 
Stop the jeep, I&#39;m getting out,&quot; she said as she stood up, holding 
onto the rollbar for support. 

&quot;Hey, sit down!&quot; Darian yelped as he took his foot off the gas and 
slowly applied the brakes. 

&quot;You&#39;re crazy if you think I&#39;m going to have anything to do with those 
bastards,&quot; the blonde fumed, her eyes narrowed. &quot;They destroyed our 
kingdom, slaughtered thousands of innocents....&quot; 

&quot;Sit down, Alex,&quot; Susan said quietly as she stared at the road ahead. 

Alex shot her a dark look. &quot;Sue, I&#39;d think that you of all people....&quot; 

&quot;SIT DOWN!&quot; 

The blonde blinked hard and slowly sat down, giving Michelle an 
uncertain look in the process. Michelle was curled up in the seat and 
holding Luna tight against her. Her skin was unusually pale and she 
was staring off into space, listening to her surroundings but not 
seeing. 

&quot;Mich, are you alright?&quot; Alex asked as she leaned forward and laid her 
hand on Michelle&#39;s arm. Her eyes went wide as she felt how dangerously 
cold Michelle&#39;s skin had become. 

&quot;Cold....&quot; Michelle replied softly, trying not to shiver. 

&quot;Don&#39;t misunderstand me, Alex,&quot; Susan said, her voice much calmer than 
before her momentary outburst. &quot;I&#39;m not looking forward to this 
anymore than you are. But if we don&#39;t get warmed up soon, we&#39;ll have a 
bigger problem on our hands than worries about the Negaverse.&quot; 

Alex said nothing as she leaned back, keeping a wary eye on Michelle 
and suddenly aware of the chill that was starting to creep into her 
bones. No one else said anything either, and the only sound heard for 
quite some time was the loud roaring of the jeep&#39;s engine as it 
accelerated. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;Move,&quot; Whisper growled as she stormed down the hallway holding an 
armful of towels. Dyvach was following her closely, doing its best to 
keep a grip on the pile of clothes stacked on top of it&#39;s carapace. 

Maze blinked and quickly stepped out of her way. &quot;What exactly is 
going on here?&quot; he asked, more than slightly confused by the 
telepath&#39;s sudden burst of activity. 

She didn&#39;t slow her pace for an instant as she made for the door. &quot;To 
be honest with you, Lieutenant, you probably know just as much as I 
do. I just know that we have three very wet visitors arriving in a few 
moments, and with the temperature dropping outside, our first concern 
should be about their welfare. We can ask them questions once they&#39;re 
not in any danger of getting hypothermia or worse.&quot; 

&quot;Need any help?&quot; he asked, not being one to get in the way of a purely 
humanitarian concern. 

Whisper paused for half a second to think. &quot;Actually, yes.... go make 
sure the showers in the main hall and the large spare room are cleared 
out. They&#39;re going to need to warm up, and the fastest way for that is 
with a hot shower.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Maze replied as he turned around and headed back down 
the residential hallway. 

&lt;Have clothing/towels sufficient?&gt; a voice gently intruded into her 
mind as she came to the main foyer of the cathedral. 

&lt;If we don&#39;t, we can always find more&gt; she telepathed back to Ra&#39;vel 
as she opened the door. &lt;Where are you?&gt; 

&lt;Tolaris feel avian/weaver presence unwise, meet when settled&gt; 

Whisper stopped before going outside, suddenly reminded of the fact 
that the only humans to ever have met an avian like Ra&#39;vel were the 
Sailor Scouts. &quot;Dyvach, set the clothes down here and go back to your 
nest,&quot; she said with a quiet sigh. 

It would have blinked if it had eyelids. Instead, it froze in 
mid-motion and gave her a perplexed chime, it&#39;s carapace turning a 
rather pretty shade of lavender. 

&quot;Odds are they&#39;ve never seen a weaver before,&quot; she explained. &quot;We 
should spare them the culture shock until they&#39;re somewhat settled in 
first.&quot; She blinked as Dyvach began to make a noise that sounded like 
a piece of concrete rapidly being drawn across rusted piano strings. 
It took her a moment to realize that it was actually laughing out 
loud. It carefully set the pile of clothing down on the inside of the 
foyer and headed towards the staircase, it&#39;s carapace a blotchy mix of 
red, light blue, and an incandescent shade of green. 

&quot;It&#39;s not going to throw up, is it?&quot; Tolaris asked with concern as he 
poked his head in the open doorway and glanced at the retreating 
weaver. He knew that weavers often lost control of the coloring of 
their crystal shells in certain situations, the two most notable being 
when laying eggs and as a precursor to being forced to evacuate their 
stomachs. 

Whisper shook her head. &quot;Dyvach found the idea of culture shocking our 
guests to be.... amusing.&quot; 

&quot;Just as long as he doesn&#39;t throw up again,&quot; Tolaris replied with a 
very sour expression on his face. He caught Whisper&#39;s mildly curious 
look and shook his head. &quot;Bear in mind his stomach acids are strong 
enough to break down virtually any type of matter into its constituent 
elemental particles.&quot; 

The telepath frowned as she sorted through her limited knowledge of 
basic chemistry and blinked at the results. &quot;Umm, how bad was it?&quot; 

&quot;It was outside at the time, so didn&#39;t do any serious damage.... 
although it did dissolve through a good fifteen feet of solid rock 
before the acids and enzymes neutralized themselves,&quot; Tolaris 
explained. &quot;Of course, having Dyvach belch chlorine gas for a few 
minutes afterwards didn&#39;t quite help.&quot; 

Maze blinked hard as he crossed the floor from the residential wing to 
the foyer. &quot;We have a chlorine gas leak?&quot; he asked with a small note 
of alarm in his voice. 

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Tolaris replied. He waited until Maze was finished 
sighing with relief before he continued. &quot;The only gas we have stored 
here is the reactor coolant. I was just telling the Captain about the 
hazards when a weaver has to throw up.&quot; 

&quot;Yeech,&quot; Maze said as he cast a reflexive glance towards the 
stairwell. &quot;Umm, this is just a topic of conversation and not a 
concern, right?&quot; 

Whisper nodded. &quot;I doubt we&#39;d be standing here idle if there was a 
puddle of concentrated acid around.&quot; 

The conversation came to a halt as the sound of an engine reached 
their ears, shortly followed by the sounds of Darian&#39;s jeep slowly 
driving down the stretch of packed gravel that served as the &#39;road&#39; in 
and out of the secluded cathedral. 

Whisper took one look at the group huddled in the jeep and frowned. 
&quot;Are the showers ready, Lieutenant?&quot; she said as she started forward, 
even before the jeep came to a halt. 

&quot;Perfectly,&quot; Maze replied as he glanced over the newcomers. &quot;You 
know,&quot; he said quietly to Tolaris as the women&#39;s expressions changed 
as they saw the denizens, &quot;I have a feeling this might not be too 
pleasant. The one with the green hair is giving me chills already.&quot; 

&quot;As you were, Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris said quietly. His voice was 
carefully neutral but contained an edge of command to it. Maze shot 
him a brief glance but didn&#39;t say anything further. 

&quot;They&#39;re on our side,&quot; Darian cautioned quietly as he set the brake 
and turned off the engine. 

Susan unbuckled her seatbelt and opened the door, still keeping a 
careful grip on Myst. &quot;With all due respect, your Highness, I will be 
the judge of that,&quot; she replied in a soft tone that could only be 
described as glacial. 

Whisper didn&#39;t slow her pace until she was standing next to the jeep. 
&quot;My name is Whisper, and I think we can skip the formalities until 
you&#39;re all dry,&quot; she said as she held out a towel to Susan. 

Susan regarded her very carefully before slowly reaching out. &quot;Susan 
Meiou. Thank you,&quot; she added neutrally as she took the offered towel. 
She then began to rub Myst with it while still keeping a very wary eye 
on Whisper. 

&quot;Should I ask why you&#39;re all wet?&quot; Whisper carefully asked as she 
moved over to where Alex and Michelle were climbing out of the back of 
the jeep. 

&quot;Long story,&quot; Alex muttered sourly as she gave the telepath a look 
that was none too friendly. Whisper frowned slightly as the look and 
glanced over her shoulder to find Susan wearing a similar expression 
of distrust. 

&quot;You three don&#39;t trust me, do you?&quot; the telepath asked slowly as she 
extended a towel to the blonde. 

&quot;You&#39;re from the Negaverse, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Alex said with an edge to her 
voice. &quot;I think that speaks for itself.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s enough, Alex,&quot; Susan said, her own voice turning to steel. 

Alex gritted her teeth for a moment before she silently blew her 
breath out and took the towel from Whisper. 

Whisper turned and held out a towel to Michelle. &quot;And what do you....&quot; 
she said before her voice failed her. 

Darian had only twice before seen the color drain from a person&#39;s face 
that fast, and both times involved an obviously life-threatening 
situation. &quot;Captain....&quot; he said as he stepped forward and took her 
arm. 

The telepath blinked hard, her gaze fastened on Michelle&#39;s face and 
her world in total chaos. &quot;S&#39;Rel?&quot; she breathed softly before her 
disciplined mind reoriented itself and jarred her back into reality. 
&quot;No, that&#39;s.... that&#39;s not possible.&quot; She cleared her throat and 
continued. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I just.... for a moment I thought you were 
someone I once knew.&quot; 

Darian glanced between the two of them and was struck with the 
realization that there seemed to be a more than faint suggestion of 
resemblance. Whisper&#39;s hair was several shades lighter than Michelle&#39;s 
and she was about three inches taller, but they both bore almost 
identical builds and seemingly similar cheekbones. He glanced up at 
Susan and saw that he wasn&#39;t the only one to have noticed the 
similarities. 

&quot;Something wrong, Captain?&quot; Tolaris asked as he reached the group with 
Maze right behind him. They had seen the look on Whisper&#39;s face and 
decided it would be best to resolve everything on the spot. 

Whisper shook her head. &quot;Just a case of mistaken identity. This is 
Tolaris and Maze,&quot; she said as she introduced the Dragoons. 

&quot;Susan Meiou,&quot; Susan replied with a faint edge of distrust to her 
voice. &quot;This is Myst, and they are Alex Ten&#39;ou and Michelle Kaiou.&quot; 

&quot;I take it you&#39;re part of the military?&quot; Alex said flatly as she 
passed her towel to Michelle and glared at the denizens. 

&quot;Yes, we are,&quot; Whisper replied as she offered Alex another dry towel. 
She waited until the blonde grudingly accepted it before continuing. 
&quot;I am the captain of the Psi-Corp, Tolaris is the commander of the 
Dragoon Legion, and Maze is a Dragoon lieutenant. At least, that&#39;s 
what we were before we became exiles here on Earth.&quot; 

Susan frowned. &quot;Exiled for what?&quot; 

Tolaris sighed softly to himself. &quot;I fell in love with Sailor Mercury 
and betrayed the throne rather than destroying both her and Sailor 
Moon. The rest of the denizens here, and you&#39;ll meet Ra&#39;vel and Dyvach 
later, are my friends who helped me and the Sailor Scouts when we had 
to get a few things from the Negaverse.&quot; 

Maze grunted. &quot;What are friends for?&quot; he said dryly. 

&quot;Susan....&quot; Luna said quietly from Michelle&#39;s arms, &quot;I&#39;ve known 
Tolaris for some time now, and he is a very trustworthy ally. I 
understand how you feel about the Negaverse because of the attack on 
the kingdom. I have to admit with a small amount of shame that it took 
me far longer to trust him than the rest of the Scouts because, unlike 
them, I retained my memories of that day.&quot; 

Susan frowned slightly as she first looked at Luna, then at Michelle 
and Alex. She knew on an intellectual level that she could trust 
Luna&#39;s judgement implicitly, but still had deep reservations engraved 
into her heart. She had just begun a little soul-searching when her 
thoughts were interrupted by a sneeze from Michelle. 

&quot;That&#39;s it, everyone inside,&quot; Whisper growled. 

Susan blinked at the tone in her voice and glanced up in time to catch 
the expression of surprise on Tolaris&#39;s face. She then turned her 
attention to her human companions and instantly disliked the 
expression of discomfort on Michelle&#39;s face. 

&quot;I suggest we do as she says,&quot; Susan said to Alex and Michelle. 

&quot;Susan....&quot; Alex said in a low tone, still regarding the denizens with 
open suspicion. 

&quot;I assure you there will be a discussion about this, Alex. Later,&quot; she 
added in a tone that clearly indicated the current discussion was 
over. 

&quot;This way,&quot; Tolaris said politely as he started walking towards the 
front door of the cathedral. Susan followed him without hesitation but 
at a rather noticable distance, pausing only long enough to cast a 
glance at Alex. 

Alex frowned and was about to stand her ground when Michelle took her 
hand and squeezed it reassuringly. She returned the gesture with a 
heavy sigh and followed Susan towards the cathedral, trying to keep a 
close eye on the three denizens. 

Whisper immediately started walking towards the cathedral, but Maze 
hung back for a moment to talk to Darian. &quot;So what do you think?&quot; he 
asked in a quiet tone. 

Darian sighed quietly and leaned against his jeep. &quot;I think we&#39;re 
going to have our work cut out for us. I don&#39;t know them, but I think 
Michelle takes most of her cues from Alex, and Alex reminds me of Leda 
with PMS. Susan, on the other hand, seems to have a fairly level head 
and seems to be the type who would at least listen to what the other 
guy has to say before making up her mind. I&#39;d be wary of her, though. 
I&#39;ll admit that I get nervous when either Rei or Leda truly loses 
their temper, even Ami to some degree, but there is something about 
Susan that seriously scares me, and I don&#39;t know what.&quot; 

Maze just chuckled. &quot;Tolaris likes a diplomatic challenge, but you 
won&#39;t ever hear him admit it.&quot; 

&lt;Will you two get in here?&gt; a voice blasted into their minds. 

Maze winced. &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; he muttered as he and Darian quickly caught 
up to the group now standing in the foyer of the cathedral. &quot;You 
didn&#39;t have to yell, Captain,&quot; he said as he stepped inside and closed 
the door behind him. 

&quot;If you would cooperate, I wouldn&#39;t have to,&quot; Whisper replied with a 
mild look before turning her attention back to Susan. &quot;We&#39;ve cleared 
out two rooms for you to use. We&#39;re short on space, so two of you will 
have to share one of the large rooms.&quot; 

Susan almost smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t think that will be a problem at all.&quot; 

&quot;You can use the shower in the large bedroom and the one in the hall 
bathroom to warm up,&quot; the telepath explained as she picked up the 
bundle of clothing that Dyvach had left behind. &quot;We also have some 
clean clothes you can pick through. We weren&#39;t sure about sizes or 
anything, so we tried to make a few guesses.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;re soaked to our panties, and she wants us to take a shower?&quot; Alex 
grumbled softly to Michelle. 

&quot;It&#39;s for the heat,&quot; Susan said without turning around as she quickly 
sorted through the clothing. &quot;That would be the fastest way to warm 
yourselves up. You can worry about getting dry later. Here,&quot; she added 
as she passed a set of dry towels and some clothing to Alex. 

&quot;Thanks, I think,&quot; Alex said as she glanced at the clothing. &quot;Umm, 
does anyone have a pair of sweatpants they can loan me until 
tomorrow?&quot; 

&quot;Not a problem,&quot; Darian replied. 

&quot;The residential wing is this way,&quot; Whisper said as she guided the 
group down the hallway. &quot;The large bedroom I was talking about is the 
second door on your left, the hall bathroom is the third on the left, 
and the other small bedroom is the last door on the right.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Susan replied before she turned to Michelle. &quot;I want you 
in that shower before your body temperature drops any more. Warm, not 
hot, and don&#39;t worry about getting waterlogged.&quot; 

Michelle nodded and gently set Luna on the floor before she stepped 
into the bedroom, looking around for a moment before spotting the 
bathroom door at the far end. She gave Alex a brief kiss before she 
took a set of towels and clothing from her and quickly made her way 
into the bathroom. 

&quot;Alex, you take the hall bathroom, and don&#39;t argue with me,&quot; Susan 
said, forestalling the expected protest. &quot;Your body temperature is 
just as low, and I don&#39;t need you getting hypothermia. I&#39;ll bring you 
the sweatpants in a few moments. Now move.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; Alex said sourly as she moved past her and walked into 
the bathroom. &quot;Whoa, who&#39;s the decorator?&quot; she said to no one in 
particular before she closed the door behind her. 

Susan waited until she heard the vent fan start up before she turned 
her attention to the denizens. &quot;While they&#39;re busy, we need to have a 
talk.&quot; 

Luna frowned. &quot;I think it would be best if we were to wait until the 
three of you are warm and dry first.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m significantly less vulnerable to illnesses like pneumonia than 
they are,&quot; Susan said with a slight edge to her voice. &quot;And what I&#39;d 
like to talk about isn&#39;t something I wish them to hear just yet.&quot; 

&quot;Very well then,&quot; Tolaris said as he clasped his hands in front of 
him. &quot;I sense an interrogation as opposed to a conversation, but I 
don&#39;t think I can blame you given the circumstances.&quot; 

Susan paused for a moment as she regarded him very carefully. &quot;I&#39;m 
aware of the extreme length of the denizen lifespan,&quot; she said slowly. 
&quot;Were any of you involved in the invasion upon our kingdom?&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;No. I wasn&#39;t born until almost three hundred years 
after that, and I&#39;m older than anyone else here.&quot; 

Whisper cleared her throat. &quot;I beg your pardon, Commander, but I&#39;ve 
got almost a full century over you.&quot; 

The dragoon flushed a light shade of gray. &quot;My apologies. It&#39;s not 
easy to keep track of everyone&#39;s age after a few hundred years.&quot; 

&quot;So how old do I look?&quot; the telepath asked carefully. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Truthfully? Low-end six hundred.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; 

Susan gave Tolaris a slightly quizzical look. &quot;May I ask your exact 
age?&quot; 

&quot;Let me think for a moment,&quot; he said as he did a bit of mental math. 
&quot;I think I&#39;m seven hundred and twenty-five, but I&#39;ve lost track of the 
exact date in the Negaverse.&quot; 

Susan blinked in surprise for a moment before regaining her composure. 
&quot;I see....&quot; she said slowly. &quot;I am also aware of the &#39;chaos factor&#39; in 
the denizen biological makeup. May I ask how that has affected each of 
you?&quot; 

Tolaris gave her an odd look. &quot;Excuse me for a moment, but for a human 
from the Moon Kingdom, you seem to know an awful lot about denizens.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re not the first denizen I&#39;ve held a discussion with that didn&#39;t 
involve a demand for my surrender,&quot; she replied flatly. She cast a 
glance at Darian before she added, &quot;And I&#39;m not fully human.&quot; 

Everyone blinked at her statement. Tolaris gently cleared his throat 
and gave Susan a slightly wary look. &quot;That denizen you had a talk 
with.... I don&#39;t suppose he happened to have been a Dragoon Captain 
named Raijen, would he?&quot; 

Susan stepped back as if she had been slammed in the gut with a 
hammer. &quot;What? How....&quot; she said, at a momentary loss for words. 

&quot;Like everything else that&#39;s happened in the past hour or so, it&#39;s a 
long story,&quot; Maze said dryly. 

Susan struggled to regain her composure and looked at Darian again. 
&quot;Then I take it that you know....&quot; 

&quot;...That Serena&#39;s father was a denizen,&quot; Darian finished for her. 
&quot;Yes, we made that discovery not too long ago.&quot; 

Tolaris reached a decision and placed a hand on Susan&#39;s shoulder, 
knowing full well that he was risking serious bodily harm by doing so. 
&quot;Susan, listen to me,&quot; he said softly, ignoring the sudden flash of 
anger in her eyes. &quot;I am a Dragoon like Raijen. I once commanded the 
legion as he once did, and I have done my best to uphold the same 
moral values that he once taught. Yes, some of the legion attacked the 
Moon Kingdom, but had they known that they would be fighting Raijen&#39;s 
consort and daughter, they would have refused.&quot; 

&quot;I was with them when they discovered Serena&#39;s lineage,&quot; Maze said. 
&quot;When we met Raijen&#39;s spirit and the spirit of Queen Serenity told him 
that he had a daughter, I wasn&#39;t sure who was going to have a stroke 
first, Tolaris or the Captain. And to be honest, I wasn&#39;t feeling too 
good myself. What you don&#39;t realize is that we&#39;re not just special 
intelligence soldiers, but students of Raijen&#39;s beliefs.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded and removed his hand from Susan&#39;s shoulder. &quot;And one of 
his core beliefs is loyalty. Not just to the throne, but to the legion 
as a whole and to each other. When the legion was first founded, most 
of those who volunteered were without living blood ties. Raijen forged 
the legion into a sort of family for them, and in doing so became a 
legend to those who served with him. We would extend that sense of 
trust and loyalty to his daughter. Despite the fact that even today 
most Dragoons are single and few with living relatives, we still hold 
such family values in the highest regard. And so, until she proves 
unworthy of loyalty either through word or deed, Serena&#39;s words would 
be regarded as Raijen&#39;s and acted upon accordingly by any Dragoon.&quot; 

&quot;Provided the legion is aware of her bloodline,&quot; Whisper said quietly. 

&quot;K&#39;tal knows,&quot; Tolaris replied. &quot;Don&#39;t ask me how he found out, but he 
asked me about it before I could bring it up. He&#39;s being very careful 
about how he lets that information out, since he doesn&#39;t want to tip 
off Rune and call the legion&#39;s loyalty to the throne into question.&quot; 

Susan said nothing as she glanced down at Myst, still absently 
stroking her damp fur. &quot;I think I understand a few things now,&quot; she 
said, then paused as she heard a rather delicate chiming sound coming 
down the hall. She saw the looks of horror cross the denizens&#39; faces 
and tensed up, unsure of what was going to happen next. She was 
preparing herself for a dimensional teleport when the source of the 
chiming came into view and she blinked hard. 

&quot;You have bad timing,&quot; Tolaris said wearily as he saw Susan&#39;s 
expression. &quot;I told you to wait for awhile before coming up here.&quot; 
Dyvach shrugged as it stepped past him, carrying a pair of sweatpants 
and chiming softly to itself. 

Susan felt Myst&#39;s claws digging into her arms in shock and she 
suddenly wasn&#39;t feeling too stable either. &quot;What.... are you?&quot; she 
asked slowly, unsure if the crystal spider could understand her. She 
had met life-forms that were far more hideous that it, but wasn&#39;t sure 
how dangerous it was. 

&quot;Susan, this is Dyvach. Dyvach is one of the more sentient weavers 
that live in the Negaverse,&quot; Tolaris explained. &quot;It can understand us 
quite well, although my understanding of its native language is 
pathetic at best.&quot; 

&quot;Hello,&quot; Susan said cautiously. Dyvach chimed back a greeting and held 
up the sweatpants to her, adding a series of chimes as it did so. 

&quot;Ahh.... I think those are the sweatpants Darian said Alex could 
borrow,&quot; Tolaris said after a doing a quick mental translation. &quot;I&#39;m 
not quite sure where he said he got them from, though.&quot; 

&quot;Hopefully from the dryer in the lower level,&quot; Darian said. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Susan said as she took the offered sweatpants with only a 
slight hesitation. 

&quot;You seem to be taking this well,&quot; Darian observed. &quot;You should have 
seen the others freak out when they first met it.&quot; 

Susan regarded the weaver carefully. &quot;I would think that after going 
through as much as I have, it would take more than meeting a sentient 
spider to seriously upset me. Disturb, yes, but not truly upset.&quot; 

The door behind her suddenly opened and Alex stuck her head out, 
holding a very large towel against her body. &quot;Oh, there you are.... 
cool, you got it,&quot; she said without preamble as she snatched the 
sweatpants out of Susan&#39;s grip. &quot;Thanks, Sue,&quot; she said and closed the 
door. 

&quot;Patience is not her strong suit,&quot; Susan said lightly. 

&quot;We&#39;ve noticed,&quot; Maze replied dryly. 

The door slowly opened and Alex stuck her head out again, the towel 
still wrapped around her. She looked down at Dyvach and blinked. &quot;Umm, 
Sue, I have a question for you,&quot; she said slowly. 

&quot;You&#39;re not hallucinating,&quot; Susan said. 

Alex blinked hard. &quot;That&#39;s what I was afraid of,&quot; she said as her face 
turned a sickly shade of white. &quot;Is it okay to panic now?&quot; 

&quot;Go ahead and get dressed and I&#39;ll introduce you,&quot; Susan replied with 
a faint smile on her lips. 

&quot;Right....&quot; Alex said uncertainly as she closed the door again. 

&quot;How about if we get the heart attack over with and get Ra&#39;vel over 
here?&quot; Maze suggested as he leaned against the wall. &quot;After meeting 
Dyvach, someone like her shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to comprehend.&quot; 

Tolaris gave Susan an appraising look for a moment and she raised an 
eyebrow at him. He shrugged and turned to Whisper. &quot;Might as well ask 
her to join us.&quot; He turned back to Susan and added, &quot;Be warned, 
however, she will probably decide to teleport in.&quot; 

Susan almost smiled. &quot;Now sudden appearances and disappearances are 
something I&#39;m definitely used to.&quot; As if on cue, Ra&#39;vel suddenly 
winked into existence a few feet away from Whisper. She blinked when 
she saw Susan and chirped a greeting at her. 

&quot;This is Dragoon Lieutenant Ra&#39;vel,&quot; Tolaris said. 

Susan frowned. &quot;I think I&#39;ve met your species before,&quot; she said with a 
slight edge to her voice. &quot;The term is avian, correct?&quot; 

&lt;Term translation correct&gt; Ra&#39;vel&#39;s voice echoed inside Susan&#39;s mind. 
&lt;Where meet avian before?&gt; 

Darian just sighed quietly as he saw Susan&#39;s eyes widen unexpectedly. 
&quot;Both Ra&#39;vel and Whisper are telepathic,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;They 
can&#39;t read your mind from a distance, but they can project their 
thoughts.&quot; 

&quot;I see,&quot; Susan said flatly. 

The bathroom door opened and Alex stuck her head out, this time 
wearing a loose-fitting blouse and the pair of sweatpants. &quot;Okay, Sue, 
I think I&#39;m prepared for.... WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!&quot; she yelped as 
she saw Ra&#39;vel. 

&quot;Ladies, please calm down,&quot; Tolaris said with a weary sigh. 

&quot;Alex, this is Dyvach,&quot; Susan said evenly as she gestured to the 
weaver. &quot;And this is Ra&#39;vel. Now if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m still a little 
wet and would like to warm up in the shower.&quot; 

&quot;W-Wait, wait a minute,&quot; Alex stammered as she struggled to get a grip 
on the present situation. 

&quot;They&#39;re both intelligent and can understand what you say, so be 
nice,&quot; Susan said as she stepped past her and into the bathroom, still 
holding Myst in her arms. &quot;I&#39;ll be out in a few minutes, and both 
Darian and Luna are right here so there&#39;s no need to panic,&quot; she said 
and closed the door behind her. 

Alex blinked, glanced at the closed door, then looked at both Ra&#39;vel 
and Dyvach. &quot;Oh, crap, this is definitely not a good day...&quot; she 
muttered. 

Everyone jumped as a truly piercing scream erupted from behind the 
group. They all whirled around to find Michelle standing in the 
doorway of the large bedroom, dressed in a light-colored blouse and 
skirt. Her eyes were nearly triple their usual diameter and she was 
staring at Dyvach, her skin as white as a sheet and looking like she 
was only moments away from either cardiac arrest or fainting. 

&quot;I know what you mean, love, but don&#39;t do that again,&quot; Alex called out 
to her as she rubbed the inside of her ear. &quot;Sue says everything&#39;s 
cool and we&#39;re just meeting the rest of them.&quot; 

&quot;But.... t-that.... that&#39;s a SPIDER...!&quot; Michelle whimpered as she 
edged away. &quot;A BIG spider...!&quot; 

Alex looked down at Dyvach and gulped. &quot;Yeah, I know. His name&#39;s 
Dyvach, and from what I understand, he&#39;s not only smart but kinda 
friendly,&quot; she said as she reached down and hesitantly patted it&#39;s 
carapace. 

Darian gave the blonde a concerned look. He could see that her hand 
was visibly shaking as she touched the weaver, and knew that she was 
putting on a show in an effort to calm Michelle down. Dyvach made a 
cooing noise as it was patted, the crystalline shell turning a soft 
green color where she touched it. Alex wasn&#39;t prepared for the color 
change and had to bite her tongue to stifle a yelp of surprise, 
forcing a weak smile on her lips instead. 

&quot;A VERY BIG spider....&quot; Michelle whimpered, still looking deathly 
pale. 

Alex sighed and walked towards her. &quot;I know you don&#39;t like spiders, 
Mich, and quite frankly I&#39;m not too keen on the idea of one the size 
of a small pony either, but you need to calm down,&quot; she said as she 
took her hand and gave it a comforting squeeze. &quot;Hell, I need to calm 
down, but if Sue&#39;s not throwing a bitch-fit about it, then I guess it 
can&#39;t be all that bad.&quot; 

Michelle blinked and cast a nervous glance at Ra&#39;vel. &quot;And w-what.... 
I mean, who are you?&quot; she hesitantly asked the avian. 

&quot;That&#39;s Ra&#39;vel,&quot; Alex said as Ra&#39;vel chirped a greeting at her. 

&quot;I still say Ami had the best reaction,&quot; Darian said to Luna. &quot;Granted 
she didn&#39;t scream like that, but I still wish I had a picture of the 
expression on her face.&quot; 

Luna gave him a sour expression as she flicked her ears back. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;ve heard Serena scream like that,&quot; she muttered. 

Maze chuckled. &quot;That was actually a pretty good scream for a human,&quot; 
he said with a mischievous grin. &quot;You should hear Ra&#39;vel when she gets 
hyper. Well, maybe you shouldn&#39;t,&quot; he added as he thought about it. 
&quot;The last time I heard her scream, it was in the in the ultra-sound 
range and it shattered the windows for three of your city blocks.&quot; 
Ra&#39;vel shot him a dark look and made a distateful chirping noise to 
herself. 

Whisper walked over to Michelle and Alex. &quot;Are you going to be 
alright?&quot; she asked Michelle. &quot;I know this is a major shock for you 
both, but I assure you that we aren&#39;t your enemies.&quot; She noticed that 
Alex&#39;s expression hardened when she said that, but Michelle&#39;s 
expression didn&#39;t change. &quot;Do you think you can handle another 
surprise?&quot; 

&quot;Like what?&quot; Alex said flatly as she edged herself in front of 
Michelle. 

&quot;Ra&#39;vel and I are telepathic, which means we can speak directly to 
your minds,&quot; Whisper explained slowly. &quot;We can&#39;t read your thoughts 
without making a direct link, so you don&#39;t have to worry about any 
sort of intrusions.&quot; 

Alex frowned and Michelle blinked. &quot;Oh, lovely,&quot; Alex grumbled. &quot;Just 
what we need to think about. I hope you&#39;re telling us this for a 
reason.&quot; 

Whisper ignored the burning sensation on the back of her neck caused 
by Tolaris staring at her. &quot;Yes, I am. I thought it would be wise to 
tell you about it now instead of having you find out about it later 
and worry if we&#39;ve been reading your mind.&quot; 

&quot;How do we know you&#39;re not doing it now?&quot; Alex said. 

&lt;I can project my thoughts, but I assure you I can&#39;t read thoughts 
without a telepathic link&gt; Whisper&#39;s soft voice echoed in their minds. 
&lt;If you like, you can ask the other Sailor Scouts about it&gt; 

&quot;Whoa....&quot; Alex said as she took a step back. 

Darian chuckled. &quot;Yeah, I remember being taken aback the first time 
she spoke to my mind like that. I heard what she said to you, by the 
way, and she usually doesn&#39;t broadcast openly like that.&quot; 

&quot;Have pity on the psi-mutes,&quot; Tolaris said dryly. 

Whisper gave the Dragoon an amused look. &quot;Commander Tolaris&#39;s brain is 
defective,&quot; she explained to Alex and Michelle with a grin. &quot;He not 
only can&#39;t hear me, but he&#39;s totally immune to all mental forms of 
psionics.&quot; 

&quot;So sorry, Captain,&quot; Tolaris replied, his voice tinged with frost. 

Michelle blinked and looked around. &quot;Did anyone just see a flash?&quot; 

There was a moment of silence as everyone looked around. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think anyone did,&quot; Alex said carefully. &quot;At least I didn&#39;t see 
anything.&quot; 

Dyvach made a single multi-harmonic chime and pointed at the bathroom 
door. Tolaris frowned at the translation of the weaver&#39;s words. 
&quot;Dyvach said it saw a flash coming from inside the bathroom.&quot; 

Alex just sighed. &quot;If that&#39;s the case, then it was probably Susan 
doing her time-travel stunt again.&quot; She noticed the identical blank 
looks she was getting from the denizens and shrugged. &quot;She&#39;s the 
Guardian of Time and has the ability to move back and forth among the 
temporal flow,&quot; she explained. &quot;You&#39;d need to ask her about it as I 
barely understand it myself, but I know that it creates a flash of 
light everytime she uses that power.&quot; 

&quot;That would explain what we saw over the lake,&quot; Darian said to Luna. 

&quot;Time travel....&quot; Whisper said slowly as she narrowed her eyes. 
&quot;Ra&#39;vel, do you remember those strange bursts of energy you said you 
were picking up on occasion awhile ago? Around the time Leda was in 
the Negaverse?&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel nodded slowly, then suddenly fluffed her feathers and hissed as 
a dull flash of light emerged from under the bathroom door. The door 
opened a few moments later and Susan stepped out, dressed in a rather 
nice blouse and skirt. She was holding her staff in one hand and Myst 
was carefully perched on her shoulder, looking decidedly drier than 
before. 

&quot;Where&#39;d you get that?&quot; Maze asked with a frown as he stared at the 
staff. 

&quot;I&#39;ll explain in a moment,&quot; she said as she turned to Alex and 
Michelle. &quot;I just spent three days doing a little observation of the 
interaction between the Sailor Scouts and the denizens. Luna&#39;s right, 
they&#39;re not only trustworthy allies but good friends. And a little bit 
more in some cases,&quot; she added, giving Tolaris and Maze a meaningful 
look. 

&quot;He started it,&quot; Maze protested as he pointed at Tolaris while 
everyone else blinked hard at the sudden declaration. 

&quot;Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris said reprovingly. 

&quot;Hey, if you and Ami hadn&#39;t hit it off, Mina and I would never have 
met under favorable circumstances, if at all,&quot; Maze explained with a 
shrug. 

&quot;Sue, what are we going to do with you?&quot; Alex said as she buried her 
face in her hands and leaned against Michelle. &quot;One minute you&#39;re 
saying they&#39;re more dangerous than snakes, and the next you&#39;re saying 
they&#39;re our pals. Hey, wait a sec,&quot; she said as she lifted her head up 
and glared at her. &quot;Have you been smoking those herbs again?&quot; 

&quot;I assure you I have not,&quot; Susan replied with an edge to her voice. 

&lt;Everybody hush up for a moment,&gt; Whisper&#39;s voice echoed through their 
minds loud enough to make them all wince. 

&quot;Must you yell?&quot; Maze muttered as he massaged his temples. 

Whisper ignored him. &quot;Now that I have your attention, let&#39;s try to get 
a few things clarified. Susan, can you explain what you just said?&quot; 

Susan nodded and leaned her staff against the wall. &quot;As the avatar of 
the Underworld, I am responsible for guarding the portal to Time. As 
such, I can travel through time at will. From your standpoint, I was 
in the bathroom for only a few minutes, but from my perspective I 
spent three days in the past observing you and the Sailor Scouts.&quot; 

Dyvach made a series of simple chimes and Susan nodded. &quot;Yes, I know. 
Dyvach first met me months ago when I arrived in that time period. 
I&#39;ll spare you the details of that meeting, but I gave him a small gem 
to hold onto for awhile that would record what happened around it.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel suddenly squawked and Whisper blinked. &quot;So that&#39;s what that 
was,&quot; she said as she turned to Tolaris. &quot;Do you remember when you 
told us about your experiences during the Mintaka campaign?&quot; 

Tolaris grunted and nodded. &quot;Yes, I remember that gem now.&quot; He turned 
and gave Susan an odd look. &quot;And I also remember finding a strand of 
dark green hair in the hallway that evening. Now I know where they 
both came from.&quot; 

Susan smiled and ran her fingers through her long, dark green hair. &quot;I 
had snagged the painting by accident, but I didn&#39;t think I had left 
anything behind. Anyway, I then returned to my keep and spent quite 
some time viewing the images in the gem. It&#39;s one thing for a trusted 
friend like Luna to say you&#39;re trustworthy, but it&#39;s another to 
actually see how you act around the Princess and the others.&quot; 

Alex sighed. &quot;That&#39;s nice, Sue, but can we get to the point?&quot; 

Susan resisted the urge to roll her eyes. &quot;The point,&quot; she said 
slowly, &quot;Is that that we are in no danger whatsoever. I haven&#39;t been 
able to reach a decision on the trust issue from a personal 
standpoint, but that is something we have time to deal with. They are, 
for the most part, as benign as they claim to be.&quot; 

Maze shrugged. &quot;Thank you, I think.&quot; 

&quot;Maybe you should save your thanks until after I&#39;ve had a chance to 
talk to Mina about you,&quot; Susan suggested evenly, then turned to 
Tolaris. &quot;And you and I need to sit down in the very near future and 
have a long talk about Ami&#39;s condition.&quot; 

Michelle frowned. &quot;Did something happen to Ami?&quot; 

&quot;Well....&quot; Susan said hesitantly. &quot;I can&#39;t really say if something has 
happened or not. You must realize that they, like Darian, are 
reincarnations of past individuals. They may look like them, probably 
almost all the way down to the genetic level, but they have been 
raised in this environment and would of course behave differently. 
Rei, for instance, retains her fascination with the spiritual but has 
pursued it with a startling degree of vehemence, and I don&#39;t know 
where Leda picked up her penchant for cooking.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s a very good cook, by the way,&quot; Maze added and the rest of the 
denizens nodded in agreement. &quot;Not just with human foods, but with 
denizen dishes as well.&quot; 

Alex sighed and glanced at Michelle. She received a rather reluctant 
nod and the blonde grumbled something inaudible to herself. &quot;Thanks a 
lot, you just had to mention food,&quot; she said. 

Darian chuckled. &quot;That&#39;s easily solved. Leda usually has two or three 
different things pre-cooked and stored in the refrigerator to use as a 
rather large snack. What would you like?&quot; 

&quot;Right now? Probably anything,&quot; Alex admitted and Michelle nodded. 

&quot;Ooo, be careful when you say that,&quot; Darian cautioned her. &quot;I once saw 
Ra&#39;vel trying to eat something that was desperately trying to ooze out 
of the bowl as she ate it. I don&#39;t think we have any of that left, but 
I do know we have a few rather.... unique denizen foodstuffs stored 
here.&quot; 

&quot;Ick....&quot; Michelle said as she turned pale. 

&lt;Fresh ne&#39;akh good tasting&gt; the avian telepathed with a shrug. 

Alex grunted. &quot;I don&#39;t mind coffee strong enough to crawl out of the 
cup, but I&#39;ll pass on anything that moves on its own. Got any steak?&quot; 

Whisper shrugged. &quot;I think we still have a few oratu steaks that could 
be cooked easily enough. And I know everyone likes the taste of that.&quot; 

Alex glanced at Susan and the succubus shrugged. &quot;Do I even want to 
ask what an oratu is?&quot; Alex asked cautiously. 

&quot;Denizen idea of a cow,&quot; Darian replied. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen one, but 
they do taste pretty good. And unlike some things Maze has been known 
to eat, oratu is perfectly harmless to humans.&quot; 

Maze made a face. &quot;I hope you&#39;re referring to Mina&#39;s cooking and not 
to what she was supposed to have been cooking,&quot; he muttered. 

Michelle giggled and a small smile crossed Susan&#39;s face. &quot;Perhaps some 
things don&#39;t change after all,&quot; she observed. &quot;I just hope her cooking 
skills haven&#39;t gotten worse.&quot; 

&quot;Not sure it can get any worse,&quot; Darian muttered. 

&quot;So who&#39;s turn is it to cook?&quot; Maze asked, ignoring Darian&#39;s comment 
while privately agreeing with his assessment. 

&quot;It&#39;s still technically Rei&#39;s turn, but seeing how she&#39;s not here, I 
guess I can volunteer for it,&quot; Whisper said as she looked at Michelle 
and Alex. &quot;But I might need a little help from you two. I usually 
don&#39;t cook oratu steaks suited to human tastes, so I&#39;ll need someone 
to tell me if I&#39;m using the right amounts of spice.&quot; 

Darian chuckled. &quot;That might not be a bad idea. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve 
ever eaten any denizen foods before, but for the most part they tend 
to be very bland. That&#39;s not to say they lack flavor,&quot; he added 
hastily as Whisper gave him a mild look. &quot;It&#39;s just that denizen 
digestive systems aren&#39;t able to handle a lot of spice.&quot; 

&quot;Ahh, I see,&quot; Alex said as Michelle nodded. &quot;So what does oratu taste 
like without the spices?&quot; 

The denizens all looked at Darian as he flushed. &quot;Well.... I don&#39;t 
know if there are exact words for it, but it does kinda beg for a 
bottle of A-1 or something,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;Leda could probably 
tell you better.&quot; 

&quot;You mean like comparing ma&#39;cha to dirty dishwater and v&#39;etu to 
shredded cardboard?&quot; Tolaris said dryly. 

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Darian said with a faint blush. 

Alex chuckled. &quot;Yeah, we always knew Leda would make a great 
diplomat.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s odd, we used to say the same about you,&quot; Susan observed as she 
reached up and scratched Myst&#39;s ear. 

Michelle giggled and Alex shot her a dark look. &quot;Keep it up and you&#39;ll 
be sleeping alone tonight,&quot; she growled softly at her. 

&quot;Maybe we should worry about those steaks first,&quot; Whisper said 
carefully as Michelle blinked and gave the blonde a slightly hurt 
look. &quot;Michelle, how good are you at cooking?&quot; 

Michelle blinked again. &quot;I&#39;m not all that good, but we should be okay 
as long as nothing fancy needs to be done.&quot; 

Whisper nodded. &quot;Fair enough. Maze, go see if you can find something 
suitable in the cellar. Nothing too strong, and make sure it&#39;s pale.&quot; 

&quot;Not a problem,&quot; Maze replied as he started walking towards the 
stairwell at the other end of the cathedral. 

&quot;Now if you two will come with me, we&#39;ll get those steaks started and 
let Tolaris and Susan finish their meeting of the minds,&quot; Whisper said 
as she cast a sidelong glance at Tolaris before heading towards the 
kitchen. Michelle and Alex exchanged looks before the blonde shrugged 
and they both began to follow the telepath. 

Ra&#39;vel made a curious chirping noise as she moved over to Susan&#39;s side 
to get a better look at Myst. The Shinma&#39;s fur started to spike at the 
sudden scrutiny and Susan winced as she felt her claws digging into 
her shoulders. &quot;Watch the claws,&quot; she admonished the kitten. 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Myst replied as she tried relaxing, still keeping a very wary 
eye on Ra&#39;vel. 

&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if you could talk or not,&quot; Tolaris observed. &quot;I know 
you looked like a lunar cat, but wasn&#39;t sure if they could talk as 
kittens.&quot; 

&quot;Unfortunately, kittens can,&quot; Luna grumbled quietly to herself. &quot;And 
just like human children, learning can be a rather.... taxing 
experience.&quot; 

Myst gave him a resigned look. &quot;I&#39;m not a lunar cat.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s a type of demon called Shinma,&quot; Susan explained. &quot;I met her 
when I awoke in The Dark and took her with us when we escaped here.&quot; 

Tolaris and Ra&#39;vel exchanged slightly concerned looks and the avian 
made a very quiet chirping noise. Tolaris shrugged and turned back to 
Susan. &quot;I&#39;m not going to pretend to understand any of that,&quot; he 
admitted. &quot;Perhaps you can explain it to me at another time.&quot; 

Myst blinked and gave Ra&#39;vel a strange look as she heard the avian&#39;s 
telepathic voice inside her mind. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll stay with 
Susan for the time being,&quot; she said slowly. Ra&#39;vel shrugged and gave 
Luna a questioning look, telepathically asking her the same question 
she had asked Myst. 

Luna shook her head. &quot;Usually I&#39;d be delighted to, Ra&#39;vel, but I think 
it would be best if I too remained with Susan for the present. There 
is much we have to talk about, and I suspect a lot will be said before 
we go to bed.&quot; Ra&#39;vel shrugged again and chirped something at Tolaris 
before she fluffed her feathers and teleported out of the room. 

&quot;She&#39;s still tired from yesterday,&quot; Tolaris explained. &quot;She said to 
give you her regards and she hopes that we can reach an understanding 
tomorrow.&quot; 

Susan nodded. &quot;Hopefully, but I suspect tomorrow is going to be more 
of a surprise to everyone than expected. How long do you think it will 
take for those steaks to be cooked?&quot; 

&quot;Half an hour at most,&quot; Tolaris replied. 

She nodded again. &quot;Well then, I suppose that gives us enough time to 
answer a few more questions. You said the last bedroom was one we 
could use?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, the last one on the right,&quot; Tolaris replied as he gestured 
towards the end of the hall. &quot;Dyvach already set it up so it can be 
used tonight.&quot; 

&quot;If I may ask, how did you know we were coming?&quot; she asked as she 
started walking down the hall. 

&quot;Dyvach apparently has a precognitive sense of things, but from what 
it tried to tell me, it&#39;s not entirely able to differentiate between 
the present and the immediate future,&quot; the Dragoon explained as he 
fell in step beside her. &quot;Your arrival just happened to be one of 
those times it could tell.&quot; 

&quot;It?&quot; Susan echoed. 

&quot;Weavers don&#39;t develop gender until the later stages of their lives,&quot; 
he said with a shrug. &quot;A curious aspect of their biology, but it&#39;s 
nothing to be worried about.&quot; 

Susan reached the bedroom door and opened it. The room was empty save 
for a somewhat large bed, a chair, and a small desk. &quot;Goodness, and 
this is your idea of a small room?&quot; she said with mild surprise. 

Darian chuckled. &quot;You should see the large ones. Twice the space, the 
bed is twice as big, and they even have their own bathrooms.&quot; 

&quot;Who designed this?&quot; she asked as she stepped into the room and set 
Myst down on the desk. She walked over to the closet and opened the 
doors, making a quick estimation of its size. She heard silence in 
response and cast a mild look over her shoulder. 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;A rather respected Negaverse general.&quot; 

Susan raised an eyebrow. &quot;Let me guess. Someone who invaded?&quot; 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Tolaris said quietly as he sat down in the chair with a heavy 
sigh. &quot;From what I understand, then-Captain Nephlyte led the charge 
from the south staging areas towards the royal palace.&quot; He blinked 
hard as Susan started to chuckle softly to herself. He cast a glance 
at Darian and received a confused shrug in reply. 

&quot;Forgive me,&quot; Susan said after a moment, &quot;I was just struck by the 
sheer irony of this. If what you say is true, then odds are he was the 
one we came close to killing during the counter-attack. He had dark 
hair that came down to the base of his shoulder blades?&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s him.&quot; 

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Susan said as she continued to study the room. &quot;You 
would be well advised not to mention any of that to Alex, as they were 
practically nose-to-nose at one point in the battle and wounded each 
other. It didn&#39;t look to be serious,&quot; she said as she stared off into 
space while her mind relived the past. &quot;Just deep enough to draw 
blood, but still.... Tell me, Commander, what color is your blood?&quot; 

Tolaris blinked at the unexpected question. &quot;Gray.&quot; 

&quot;I was just curious,&quot; she said as she sat down on the edge of the bed. 
She looked up and gave Darian a slight smile. &quot;You may as well sit 
down, your Highness, we&#39;re not going anywhere.&quot; 

&quot;Why do you keep calling me that?&quot; Darian said as he sat down on the 
far end of the bed. Luna crouched for a moment before leaping up onto 
the desk and picked a convenient place to stretch out. She kept one 
eye on Myst as she did so, still not entirely sure what to think of 
the gray kitten. 

&quot;You are of royal blood, after all,&quot; Susan replied. 

&quot;A thousand years ago, maybe,&quot; Darian said with a shrug. 

&quot;You never know, Darian,&quot; Luna spoke up. &quot;You said yourself that you 
knew next to nothing about your parents before they died. They just 
might have been from a royal bloodline.&quot; 

&quot;Stranger things have happened,&quot; Susan added with a faint smile. 

Darian cleared his throat nervously. &quot;Speaking of strange things and 
bloodlines, I have a question I&#39;d like to ask you. You said earlier 
that you weren&#39;t fully human?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m only half-human,&quot; she replied, still faintly smiling. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t 
be an avatar if my mother hadn&#39;t been a Sailor Scout.&quot; 

&quot;I take it the other half is denizen?&quot; Tolaris asked quietly. 

Susan sighed and glanced towards the shuttered window. &quot;I should be so 
fortunate,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;No, Serena is the only half-denizen 
known to exist, and that was only possible because the Imperium Silver 
Crystal decided to intervene for some reason. Her bloodline was only 
known to three people back in the kingdom, however, and it was the 
Queen&#39;s wish to keep that a very guarded secret. The Princess didn&#39;t 
even know.&quot; 

&quot;She knows now,&quot; Darian said quietly. 

&quot;Have her powers evidenced themselves yet?&quot; she asked sharply. 

&quot;Not that we&#39;re aware of,&quot; Tolaris replied. &quot;And since she&#39;s only 
half- denizen, she might not possess the chaos factor. I don&#39;t mean to 
be rude or anything, but I believe you&#39;re evading the question of your 
own bloodline.&quot; 

Susan blinked before the faint smile returned to her face. &quot;That was 
not my intention. I am what humans call a succubus.&quot; 

Darian leapt to his feet as if he had been zapped with a lightning 
bolt. &quot;WHAT?!&quot; he said, his eyes wide. 

&quot;Please, sit,&quot; she said as she rose to her feet and slowly paced 
around the room. &quot;My father was an incubus who had a rather long 
romance with my mother. She didn&#39;t exactly intend to have his child, 
but she didn&#39;t have any adverse thoughts to the idea either. Her only 
complaint about getting pregnant was that it lasted for eleven 
months,&quot; she added with a quiet chuckle. 

&quot;Usually when a demon impregnates a human, or in extremely rare cases 
the other way around, the result is an alu demon. However, since 
mother was an avatar, her DNA was rather resistant to being 
over-written by father&#39;s demonic DNA. So instead of being an alu 
demon, I was born with my father&#39;s demonic nature with a mostly human 
form, resulting in a slightly atypical succubus. Darian, you should 
sit down before you pass out.&quot; 

Darian sat down hard on the edge of the bed, giving Susan an uncertain 
look. &quot;I thought things like that were mere myth,&quot; he said quietly. 
&quot;Demons who live in a burning lake, women who prey upon men in their 
sleep and steal their souls, stuff like that.&quot; 

Susan shrugged. &quot;Demons do exist,&quot; she said simply. &quot;And as for what 
you said about what we succubi do.... You&#39;re absolutely right.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned. &quot;I&#39;m not as well-versed in human mythology as Darian. 
What exactly am I missing?&quot; 

&quot;You know about the ancient legends of the Underworld?&quot; she asked. 

The Dragoon nodded. &quot;According to the Greek and Roman myths, yes. 
Their lord was a god named Hades, if memory serves.&quot; 

Susan smiled. &quot;Good, this is going to be easier than I thought. When 
he created his minions, he made the succubi look like the most 
beautiful women any man had ever seen and imbued them with the ability 
to seduce even the most reserved of men. They were also given the 
power to free souls from a mortal&#39;s body and return to the Underworld 
with it.&quot; 

&quot;They used their kiss to kill their victims,&quot; Darian said. 

&quot;Messy at times, but most effective,&quot; Susan replied. 

Tolaris raised an eyebrow. &quot;You sound as if you&#39;ve done that before.&quot; 

&quot;I have,&quot; she said with a casual shrug. &quot;You have to understand that, 
when I was born, my mother made a deal with my father. He wouldn&#39;t 
interfere in my upbringing until I was &#39;old enough&#39;, at which point I 
would spend an equal amount of time living in the Underworld learning 
about my heritage as a demon.&quot; 

She stopped walking around and began to unbutton her blouse. &quot;I was 
born looking human, but puberty decided to evidence itself in a rather 
unusual way in addition to the usual signs of femininity.&quot; 

Both Darian and Tolaris blinked as they noticed what she was doing. 
&quot;Umm, Susan....&quot; Darian started to say. 

She gave them both a soft smile as she turned her back to them and 
took off her blouse. She held the fabric against her bare chest as she 
craned her head over her shoulder to watch their reaction to the sight 
of the pair of dark scars running almost the full length of her back. 

&quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi,&quot; Tolaris breathed. &quot;What happened?&quot; 

She closed her eyes and concentrated, mentally unlocking the barrier 
she usually kept in place around the demonic psyche in her mind. She 
sighed as the scars rippled briefly before exploding outward, 
reshaping themselves into a large set of wings. 

&quot;It started when I was fourteen,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;A gradual 
swelling of a pair of oblong lumps on my back. Mother kept worrying 
about it, but my father would always assure her that it was normal for 
some type of demons. It took two years before they finished growing 
and fully emerged. Unfortunately, the emergence was a rather painful 
and protracted experience,&quot; she said as she flexed her wings. &quot;It took 
a few months before I learned how to reabsorb them and assume a more 
human form, but the scars would always remain.&quot; 

&quot;Can you fly?&quot; Tolaris asked quietly. 

&quot;No,&quot; Susan said as she shook her head. &quot;My wings are too small. 
They&#39;re about half the size of the wings on a full-blooded succubus. I 
can still use them to glide and slow my descent if I fall from a 
height, though.&quot; 

&quot;So what about your demonic side?&quot; Darian asked carefully. 

Susan turned around to look at him, still holding the blouse against 
her chest. She gave him a smile and watched him cringe reflexively at 
her faintly glowing red eyes and razor-sharp fangs protruding from 
both jaws. &quot;I won&#39;t lie to you,&quot; she said softly, her voice causing 
both Tolaris and Darian&#39;s pulses to increase. &quot;I&#39;ve seduced more 
people than I can count, and I&#39;ve killed with my kiss before. I enjoy 
doing both, and will do so again.&quot; 

&quot;Susan....&quot; Luna said quietly in a warning tone as she edged away. 

The succubus laughed quietly. &quot;I am only making them aware of what I 
am, Luna,&quot; she said as she gave the cat a gentle smile. She turned her 
back to them and reverted to her human form, putting the blouse back 
on as soon as her wings were fully absorbed. 

&quot;Jesus,&quot; Darian muttered as he sat down and tried to calm himself. 

Tolaris grunted softly as he checked his pulse. &quot;Now I know how people 
felt about Shar-Tei&#39;s power,&quot; he said quietly as he tried to slow his 
heart down before something went wrong. 

Darian avoided looking at Susan for a moment. &quot;You never did tell us 
what sort of powers she had,&quot; he said as he made an effort to control 
his breathing. 

&quot;She generated an almost irresistable sex appeal,&quot; Tolaris explained. 
&quot;She could either increase or decrease the effect as she desired, but 
couldn&#39;t turn it off completely, which occasionally led to more than a 
few problems. Thing was, however, it was induced by telepathy and 
never worked on me because I&#39;m psi-mute.&quot; 

&quot;Succubi are supposed to be sexually appealing,&quot; Susan said as she 
finished buttoning her blouse. &quot;Makes it easier to lull our victims 
into a state of mind where they can be easily taken advantage of.&quot; 

&quot;You scare me,&quot; Darian said bluntly. 

Susan blinked. &quot;I do?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll have to admit I&#39;m not too comfortable with the prospect of 
having a sexual predator around,&quot; Tolaris said. &quot;Even if you are a 
Sailor Scout. As I said, Shar-Tei&#39;s power caused a fair amount of 
trouble, the nature of which I have no desire to ever have to deal 
with again.&quot; 

Susan blinked again and slowly sat down on the edge of the bed, making 
sure she didn&#39;t startle Darian. &quot;There is so much that you don&#39;t 
understand,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Unlike the other Sailor Scouts, my 
duty is to Lord Hades and the Underworld. It was at his direction that 
I served the throne of the Moon Kingdom after my mother died, but with 
the understanding that my higher loyalty would always remain with him, 
and in case a conflict ever arose I was to obey his wishes first. 

&quot;Because I am have demonic blood in my veins, I am eternal. I am 
mortal in the sense that I can die, but my body continuously 
regenerates itself on a low-level. I&#39;m pretty much immune to sickness 
or disease, and it&#39;s impossible for me to die of old age. I may look 
like I&#39;m in my late twenties, but the fact is I&#39;m about the same age 
as Tolaris.&quot; 

She waited until the surprise wore off before she continued. &quot;I have 
been the Queen&#39;s Chancellor for over six hundred years. I have been in 
attendence for the birth of every Princess and every single Sailor 
Scout since then, and with the exception of the invasion of the Moon 
Kingdom, I have been there for the death of all but three of them. I 
helped raise each of them to be Sailor Scouts. In the absence of the 
Queen, I was in charge of running the day-to-day affairs of the 
Kingdom. Some ministers have even said that I was the throne, having 
been in my position for generations.&quot; 

She paused for a moment to sigh. &quot;You should not fear me, your 
Highness, but you should respect my demonic nature. Biology requires 
that I and the other succubi release our sexual tensions on a regular 
basis, lest that tension drive out all intellect and reason until it 
is satisfied. It is an instinct that cannot be controlled, only 
reworked into a more positive experience. Sex is almost a religion for 
us, and we frequently seek to indulge in it as one indulges a favorite 
hobby. That is why I like seducing people, viewing it as a challenge 
with a very beneficial reward. However, I have always taken the utmost 
care to ensure that such.... diversions, if you will, do not have any 
effect on my duties or responsibilities.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like Maze,&quot; Darian muttered beneath his breath, drawing a very 
unamused look from Tolaris. 

&quot;And the killing?&quot; the Dragoon asked flatly. 

Susan looked away. &quot;Most of the time it is at the direction of Hades 
or one of the other avatars who monitor the souls of the living. In 
that case, a soul has been deemed to have done enough for one life and 
is &#39;recalled&#39; to the Underworld. I merely carry out my lord&#39;s wishes 
on the matter as I and the other succubi were born to do.&quot; 

She sighed quietly to herself. &quot;And sometimes, although rarely, I kill 
just for the sake of doing so. Usually I seduce them quite thoroughly 
first to enjoy the mood, and then draw their soul out. I can&#39;t explain 
it, but there are times where it feels so wonderful to have a life in 
your hands, where you can feel it pulse beneath your lips as it is 
slowly drawn out.&quot; 

&quot;And that is why you scare me,&quot; Darian said quietly. 

Susan gave him a faint smile. &quot;I never kill friends,&quot; she said. &quot;I may 
seduce them from time to time, depending on my mood and the overall 
situation, but that&#39;s only if they want it.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed and rubbed his temples. &quot;Is this going to pose any sort 
of hazard to us, Luna?&quot; he asked tiredly. 

Luna blinked, caught off-guard by the question. &quot;Well, no,&quot; she said. 
&quot;I can&#39;t remember of any problems with her back in the Moon Kingdom, 
aside from the occasional tendency to seduce a Royal Guard now and 
then. But even then she was very discreet about it,&quot; she said with a 
feline shrug. 

&quot;Unlike some others I could name,&quot; Susan said lightly. She got a 
slightly confused look in response and she smiled. &quot;At least I never 
made enough noise to wake anyone up at odd hours in the morning.&quot; 

Luna muttered something decidedly impolite beneath her breath. Tolaris 
was the only one who heard what she said and he wisely decided to 
ignore it, instead sighing quietly. &quot;Susan, let me just say this 
much.... You and the others are welcome to stay here for the time 
being, provided you don&#39;t cause us any trouble. I&#39;m not going to 
pretend to understand half of what you said about your biology, nor do 
I think I care to know. Just as long as we have an understanding of 
things.&quot; 

Susan nodded. &quot;That we do, Commander.&quot; 

&quot;Do the others know about this?&quot; Tolaris asked as he stood up. 

&quot;Seeing how I just found out, I doubt it,&quot; Darian replied. 

The Dragoon grunted quietly. &quot;Tomorrow should be very interesting 
then,&quot; he said as he headed for the door. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to go to 
bed now. I&#39;ll give you three a tour of the cathedral in the morning, 
and I would appreciate it if you don&#39;t do any poking around until 
then. All we need is for the alarm on the vault to be tripped or the 
reactor controls messed with.&quot; 

&quot;Understood,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;Sleep well.&quot; Tolaris muttered something 
cryptic in his native language that Darian couldn&#39;t translate and 
quietly left the room. 

&quot;I&#39;ll go see how the steaks are doing,&quot; Darian said as he stood up. 

&quot;Darian, please sit for a moment,&quot; Susan said softly. She waited until 
he slowly sat back down before she gave him a slightly concerned look. 
&quot;You truly are afraid of me, aren&#39;t you?&quot; 

Darian sighed quietly. &quot;I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a little.... discomforted by 
the idea of another specialized hunter in the house, as it were.&quot; 

Susan tilted her head. &quot;Are you referring to Ami?&quot; she asked softly. 

&quot;You said you observed us in the past,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;How much do 
you know about her?&quot; 

&quot;I know what she has become, but I don&#39;t know at what price,&quot; she 
replied. &quot;If I had to guess, I would say that her soul is now as dark 
as mine. It might even be darker. However, I haven&#39;t been able to use 
my own senses to discern what her aura looks like. All I&#39;ve seen is 
what was recorded through the gemstones, and they can&#39;t see beyond the 
physical, although they have captured some rather.... interesting 
developments,&quot; she added. 

&quot;Such as?&quot; he asked warily. 

She smiled as she stood up and walked over to the desk. &quot;That&#39;s 
something that she and I will have to privately discuss,&quot; she said as 
she picked up Myst and scratched her ears. &quot;I am more than a little 
distressed at the discovery of her vampirism, but I must confess that 
at the same time I find the daughter of my best friend has become.... 
a kindrid spirit, &quot; she said quietly. She paused for a moment and 
sniffed the air. &quot;Mmm, those steaks do smell good. Perhaps I&#39;ll give 
them a try after all,&quot; she said as she walked out the door and down 
the hallway. 

Darian and Luna looked at each other, silently contemplating the whole 
situation. He sighed softly and rose to his feet, crossing over to the 
desk to pick up Luna. &quot;Well?&quot; he asked softly as he stroked her fur. 

&quot;I need to talk to Artemis,&quot; Luna replied. &quot;I think being frozen in 
suspended animation for so long has damaged my memories, and I&#39;d like 
to see how much he remembers about the past. Her words trigger so many 
memories, and I wonder what else I know about her but forgotten while 
in stasis. Tolaris was right, tomorrow is definitely going to be 
interesting.&quot; 

Darian nodded and headed for the door. &quot;No kidding, but I&#39;m starting 
to wonder.... what happens when you put a vampire, a priestess, a 
vampire-hunter, a succubus, a demonic cat, a half-denizen princess, a 
weaver, an avian, two lunar cats, three denizens, and four other 
humans all into the same room?&quot; 

&quot;One way to find out,&quot; Luna muttered sourly. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Alex and Michelle stood just outside the kitchen and stared as Whisper 
moved about at a fairly rapid pace. It wasn&#39;t her constant state of 
motion that captivated them, but the display of her psycho-kinetic 
powers as various objects floated around at her mental direction. 

&quot;That&#39;s scary,&quot; Alex said quietly. 

&lt;Psionics are somewhat common among denizens,&gt; Whisper telepathed as 
she unwrapped the steaks. Behind her, a mid-sized frying pan hovered 
patiently in place as a concrete pan slowly migrated from the stove to 
the sink. &lt;However, powers such as pyscho-kinesis, psycho-portation, 
and psycho-metabolism are not as common as simple telepathy&gt; 

&quot;Like we understood all that,&quot; Alex muttered. 

Whisper shot her an amused look. &lt;Psycho-kinesis is using psionic 
powers to affect physical objects, such as levitation or reworking 
their molecular structure. Ra&#39;vel is far more adapt at working with 
objects than I am, but I have a greater skill at projecting kinetic 
force. Cinnamon isn&#39;t one of the spices you usually use on steaks, is 
it?&gt; 

&quot;Ahh, no,&quot; Alex said as she made a face at the idea. 

&lt;Just checking&gt; Whisper telepathed as the jar of cinnamon floated back 
into the cabinet. &lt;Ami often uses a cinnamon stick in her ma&#39;cha to 
stir it around, so I wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was commonly used&gt; 

&quot;Do you have something with a light pepper content?&quot; Michelle asked. 

&lt;We might, but I never really paid any attention to what sort of 
spices the others use,&gt; Whisper admitted. &lt;After a rather.... 
explosive reaction to cayenne pepper, I tried to steer clear of 
anything that even looked like it might have sat next to something 
with a pepper content&gt; 

&quot;Ooooooh,&quot; Alex said as she winced in sympathy. &quot;That stuff isn&#39;t what 
you&#39;d call gentle. Hell, I like some spicy foods, but too much of that 
will tear me up.&quot; 

&quot;Let me see what&#39;s in here,&quot; Michelle said as she carefully stepped 
into the kitchen. She paused to let the airspace clear a path for her 
before she moved over to the cabinet and started sorting through the 
jars of spice. 

&lt;Thank you. Anyway, psycho-portation is primarily the ability to 
teleport between two points, although the actual method of doing so 
can vary&gt; 

Alex grunted. &quot;You mean like a dimension shift and a molecular 
teleport?&quot; 

&lt;Exactly, although a molecular teleport can be rather painful&gt; 

&quot;We&#39;ve noticed,&quot; Michelle said sourly as she held out a small red jar 
of a multi-purpose spice. &quot;Here, this should work well enough.&quot; She 
blinked and took a step back as an unseen force lifted the jar from 
her hand and moved it across the kitchen. 

&lt;Thank you, S&#39;R.... I mean, thank you, Michelle&gt; Whisper telepathed as 
her skin took on a noticably blue cast. She snatched a meat tenderizer 
out of the array of utensils hovering around her and started pounding 
the oratu steaks with it, occasionally adding a dash of the spice. 

Michelle cast a concerned glance at Alex and the blonde frowned. &quot;I 
don&#39;t mean to be rude, Whisper, but what do you keep calling 
Michelle?&quot; she asked with a very faint edge to her voice. 

Whisper sighed quietly and flipped the steaks over to tenderize the 
other side. &lt;S&#39;Rel was my daughter&gt; she telepathed, her mental voice 
sounding quiet and weary. &lt;She was born shortly after my husband and I 
finished healing in the aftermath of the Mintaka campaign. Well, 
physically healing, at least. Wait a minute&gt; 

Alex heard a sound behind her and turned around just as Maze came 
around the corner holding a bottle. &quot;Question.... the Man&#39;du clan 
operates from the Western Forests, right?&quot; 

&quot;I think so, but you&#39;d have to ask Ra&#39;vel about the specifics of each 
of the clans,&quot; Whisper replied. 

Maze shrugged. &quot;Well, their wine isn&#39;t the greatest, but I thought 
that it would make a good compliment for oratu,&quot; he said as he held up 
the bottle of pale pink liquid. 

Whisper raised an eyebrow. &quot;You picked a wine made by a tribe of 
avians living in a region where flowers grow as a compliment to a 
creature who lives its life roaming the Central Plains and wouldn&#39;t 
know what to do with a flower if it ever ran across one?&quot; 

Maze shrugged again. &quot;We&#39;ve needed to restock our cellar for awhile 
now. The only pale ones we have left are things made from the Western 
Forests and a couple bottles made in the Southern Flatlands, and you 
know those only go well with seafood.&quot; 

The telepath grumbled something inarticulate in her native dialect and 
Maze smirked. &quot;Yeah, but tell that to Tolaris,&quot; he said as he handed 
the bottle to Alex. &quot;You three go ahead and enjoy that, and I&#39;ll talk 
to you in the morning.&quot; He paused to listen to the voice in his mind 
and sighed. &quot;Yeah, you could say that. I&#39;m not as young as I used to 
be.&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s something I never thought I&#39;d hear you say,&quot; Whisper 
commented. 

&quot;I&#39;m almost five hundred,&quot; Maze grumped. &quot;It&#39;s taken awhile, but I 
think all that field duty is starting to catch up to me.&quot; He waited as 
he heard the voice in his mind again and chuckled. &quot;Yeah, well, gotta 
keep my exercise program going somehow.&quot; 

&quot;Get out,&quot; Whisper grumbled as she tossed the steaks into the frying 
pan and ignited the burner. 

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. Night, ladies,&quot; the Dragoon said to Alex and Michelle 
before he turned around and walked down the hall towards his bedroom. 

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Alex said quietly as she studied the bottle she was now 
holding. &quot;I take it this is your written language?&quot; 

&lt;The avian dialect of that region, yes. How do you like your steaks?&gt; 

&quot;Barbecue that bad boy,&quot; Alex said with a grin. 

&quot;She means cooked all the way through,&quot; Michelle explained. 

&lt;What Leda would call &#39;well-done&#39;?&gt; 

Michelle nodded. &quot;Exactly.&quot; 

Alex set the bottle on the counter and leaned against the 
refrigerator. &quot;So tell us more about your....&quot; 

&lt;Don&#39;t say anything,&gt; Whisper telepathed quickly as she shot the 
blonde a dark look. She sighed and returned to her task of cooking the 
steaks. &lt;I&#39;m sorry, but I find it.... hard to verbally speak of. Not 
even Tolaris knows I had a child, and if it&#39;s all the same with you, 
I&#39;d rather he not hear about it. At least, not with his ears. I feel 
that there are some things that should only be communicated mind to 
mind&gt; 

Both Alex and Michelle blinked. &quot;He.... didn&#39;t have anything to do 
with it, did he?&quot; Alex asked carefully. 

The telepath chuckled. &lt;No, of course not. At the end of the Mintaka 
campaign, Ra&#39;vel and I suffered nearly catastrophic mental damage. It 
took a full century for my psi powers to repair themselves, and during 
that time I was placed on very light administrative duty in the Psi 
Corp headquarters. We knew we had sufficient time available in the 
immediate future, so my husband and I d-decided we could risk having a 
c-child...&gt; 

Whisper looked up as she felt Michelle&#39;s hand on her shoulder. &lt;We 
named her S&#39;Rel,&gt; she telepathed as she steadied herself. &lt;And she was 
the most precious thing in our lives. Neither one of us had much in 
the way of family or close friends, so we never really made a big deal 
out of having a daughter. It was a truly interesting experience....&gt; 

&quot;Something happened, didn&#39;t it?&quot; Michelle asked very softly. 

&lt;When denizens reach puberty, a pair of latent chromosomes we call the 
chaos factor becomes active and rewrites our high-level DNA. What 
happens to us then is literally anyone&#39;s guess. Only our low-level DNA 
gets passed on to our children, so our powers don&#39;t get passed from 
generation to generation. In my case, the chaos factor resulted in my 
mind developing a strong psionic ability and my genes acquiring other 
powers. However, in S&#39;Rel....&gt; 

&quot;Hey, easy there,&quot; Alex said as she tried to comfort Whisper as a wave 
of mental pain and anguish washed over her. 

Whisper took a deep breath and backed away from the sizzling steaks. 
&lt;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to project my emotions like that. Ami once 
asked why we don&#39;t have a population problem with our long lifespans. 
The reason for that is that fewer than half of all denizens survive 
puberty because of the changes triggered by the chaos factor&gt; 

&quot;Oh, my god....&quot; Michelle breathed softly, severely shaken. 

&lt;The changes themselves are rarely physical. The true problem is 
learning to control the powers that are suddenly unleashed without 
warning. Both my husband and I were fortunate enough when we were at 
that stage to have learned how to control our powers before we did any 
serious damage....&gt; 

Whisper fell silent as she struggled to compose herself, absently 
making sure the steaks were cooked properly. &lt;From what we understand, 
she began to generate a rather strong electromagnetic field around 
her. That interfered with the power system in our house and triggered 
a feedback loop between her and the main conduits in the wall. The 
conduits overloaded and exploded in a plasma flare.... It all happened 
so fast.... We had just barely realized that her powers were 
developing when the wall blew out and the plasma ignited the air 
around her.... It was over in an instant....&gt; 

She suddenly turned and placed a hand on Michelle&#39;s cheek. &quot;You look 
so much like her,&quot; she said softly as tears started to form at the 
corners of her eyes. &quot;When I first saw you, it was like she had come 
back to me.... And after my husband was killed, I.... I....&quot; 

Alex watched silently as Michelle gave Whisper a hug and the telepath 
seemed to break down, holding her tightly as tears streamed down her 
face. She felt more than heard a presence behind her and glanced over 
her shoulder, nearly leaping out of her skin at the sight of Susan 
standing only a few inches away from her with Myst cradled in her 
arms. 

&quot;Dammit, Sue, don&#39;t do that,&quot; she said quietly as she rubbed her 
chest. 

&quot;Will she be alright?&quot; Susan asked softly as she observed Whisper and 
Michelle, neither currently aware of her presence. 

&quot;I think so,&quot; Alex said after a moment. &quot;We just got a crash-course in 
the realities of life in the Negaverse from a deeply personal 
standpoint.&quot; 

It was several moments before Susan replied. &quot;Not something you&#39;d 
expect to hear about given what we know about their culture, wouldn&#39;t 
you say?&quot; she said softly as she lightly stroked Myst&#39;s fur. 

The blonde grunted silently. &quot;Yeah, I was just thinking about that. 
Sue, just what did you see in the past?&quot; 

&quot;More than enough to know that the Negaverse as a whole isn&#39;t our 
enemy,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;Just a select few individuals who have the 
power to misguide a world into seeing things their way.&quot; 

&quot;And the rest?&quot; 

&quot;They&#39;re just like us,&quot; Susan replied quietly. &quot;They think, feel, 
laugh, cry, live, and love just like us humans do in our lives. The 
only difference is their genetic structure is more complicated than 
yours or even mine.&quot; 

&quot;You trust them?&quot; Alex asked as she jerked her chin in the direction 
of the residential wing. 

&quot;One of them is giving Michelle a hug, but you&#39;re not going 
ballistic,&quot; Susan observed quietly. &quot;I think I&#39;m not the only one 
who&#39;s having a change of heart about our so-called enemies.&quot; 

The blonde said nothing as Whisper finally released Michelle and took 
a step back, wiping the tears from her eyes. The telepath quickly 
regained her composure and glanced towards the steaks, hastily 
flipping them over to reveal a slightly charred surface. &quot;Oops....&quot; 
she said quietly. 

&quot;Relax, a little carbon never hurt,&quot; Alex said in her normal tone. 
&quot;And if it&#39;s burnt-burnt, Susan&#39;ll still eat it.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s burnt?&quot; Darian said as he came up behind Alex and Susan. 

Whisper shot them a mild look. &quot;It&#39;s not burnt, just lightly toasted.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re not taking after Mina, are you?&quot; Darian joked. 

The telepath glared him him icily. &quot;Go set the table before I give you 
a headache,&quot; she suggested evenly. 

Alex frowned. &quot;Do I want to ask?&quot; she said carefully as Darian set 
Luna on the floor and quickly sorted through the dish cabinet. 

&quot;You&#39;ve obviously never dealt with an irritated telepath before,&quot; 
Darian muttered as he darted from the kitchen carrying several plates 
and utensils. 

Whisper shrugged. &quot;I had to smack Maze one day and used a low-power 
psi spike to do it. Darian got curious what happened and asked me 
about it. I was still in a bit of an evil mood, so I spiked him as 
well.&quot; 

&quot;So now would be a bad time to be curious, eh?&quot; Alex asked warily. 

&quot;No, no, go ahead and ask,&quot; Darian said from the dining room. &quot;It&#39;s 
only excruciating when it lingers for awhile and tylenol doesn&#39;t seem 
to do much of anything about it.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s tylenol?&quot; Alex whispered to Susan. 

&quot;A generic name for a mild pain suppressant,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;Things 
like acetophenetidin, acetylsalicylic acid, and ibuprofen.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; the blonde replied as she rolled her eyes. She 
blinked and slowly inhaled as the scent of cooked steak wafted past 
her. &quot;Oh, man, will you get a whiff of that....&quot; 

Susan nodded. &quot;I could smell it from down the hall.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm, I just hope it tastes as good as it smells,&quot; Alex said as she 
cast a slightly ravenous glance at the frying pan. 

&quot;It should,&quot; Whisper replied as she picked up a knife and made a few 
cuts in the steaks. &quot;Michelle, this look okay to you?&quot; 

Michelle peered at the steaks and nodded. &quot;Oh, definitely.&quot; 

Whisper turned off the stove burner and took a step back. &quot;Well, in 
that case, all we need now are the wine glasses,&quot; she said as the 
steaks floated up into the air and onto a large plate. &quot;You two might 
want to move,&quot; she advised Susan and Alex as various items began to 
migrate into the sink. 

Susan merely raised and eyebrow and took a step back, intently 
watching the psycho-kinetic display. The freezer door opened by itself 
and five very cold glasses floated out, forming a wedge shape. Alex 
nearly jumped as the bottle of wine began to move next to her, rising 
into the air and joining the flight of glasses. 

&quot;That&#39;s still spooky,&quot; Alex said as they made their way into the 
dining room. Darian had finished setting the table and was seated at 
one end, idly watching the aerial procession of steaks and wine. 

&quot;You get used to it,&quot; Darian replied with a shrug. &quot;What sort of wine 
did Maze pick?&quot; 

&quot;Something Ra&#39;vel would probably approve of,&quot; Whisper said as she 
guided everything into place on the table. There was a series of very 
soft thunks as the steaks suddenly leapt off of the large plate and 
landed in the center of the dinner plates. The glasses all touched 
down next to a plate while the bottle gently landed in front of 
Darian. &quot;It&#39;s not a good idea to try to use kinetic force on something 
that&#39;s been bottled in a partial vacuum,&quot; she said as he gave her a 
questioning look. 

&quot;Ahh, I see,&quot; he said as he unwrapped the bottle&#39;s cork while everyone 
else sat down. 

&quot;I believe the expression Leda uses is &#39;dig in&#39;,&quot; Whisper said to 
Alex. 

Alex chuckled. &quot;Nice to see some things don&#39;t change,&quot; she said as she 
picked up her knife and fork. She then promptly began to slice into 
the oratu steak with a vengeance. 

&quot;Try to remember your manners,&quot; Susan said gently with a faint smile 
as she put Myst down in the empty chair next to her. Luna hopped up 
onto the corner of the table next to Darian and sat down, making sure 
she didn&#39;t come close enough to accidentally shed any hair near him. 

&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; Alex said reflexively before she took a bite of the 
steak. &quot;Mmm.... Doesn&#39;t taste like a cow, but it&#39;s still good. Thanks, 
Whisper.&quot; 

There was a muffled explosion as Darian worked the cork free from the 
bottle. &quot;Umm, is is supposed to pop like that?&quot; he asked carefully as 
he poured a small amount of the pale wine into his frosted glass. He 
set the bottle down and watched as it was promptly lifted into the air 
by Whisper&#39;s psycho-kinetic powers. 

&quot;Actually, yes,&quot; the telepath replied as she began to pour everyone a 
glass. &quot;The avians have made it a habit of bottling their wines under 
very low pressure to ensure the cork can&#39;t work it&#39;s way loose.&quot; 

&quot;So that was a vacuum pop and not an over-pressure pop?&quot; Darian 
inquired. 

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Whisper said as the bottle floated over to her and filled 
her wine glass. &quot;That way, you don&#39;t have to worry about a sudden 
decompression launching a projectile into the air.&quot; 

&quot;This is good,&quot; Michelle said as she chewed on a piece of her steak. 

&quot;Mmm hmm,&quot; Alex hummed as she continued to attack her steak with open 
enthusiasm. 

Susan waited until the wine bottle had filled her glass and landed 
back down on the table before gingerly picking up her glass. She did 
her best to ignore the tingling in her fingertips caused by the 
extreme temperature of the chilled glass and inhaled the faint scent 
of the wine. 

&quot;It works best if you drink it instead of snort it,&quot; Alex said around 
a mouthful of slightly charred oratu. 

Susan shot her a reproving look. &quot;Don&#39;t talk with your mouth full,&quot; 
she chided the blonde as she sniffed the wine again. She could only 
detect a tiny amount of alcohol in it and found the faint flowery 
smell rather pleasing. Taking a small sip, she let the flavor roll 
around her tongue briefly before swallowing. &quot;This is.... definitely 
unique,&quot; she said after a moment. 

Whisper shrugged. &quot;As Maze said, it&#39;s not the best choice for oratu, 
but it goes well enough with it.&quot; She took a bite of her steak and 
made a slight face as she chewed. She swallowed and took a rather 
large sip of her wine. &quot;Although I don&#39;t think it was intended to go 
along with a spiced steak.&quot; 

&quot;You going to be alright?&quot; Darian asked as he cut a small piece of 
steak and held it out to Luna. There was a quick flash of motion and 
he blinked, giving her an odd look. She gave him a slightly abashed 
look as she not quite discreetly munched on the piece of steak. 

&quot;The spicing isn&#39;t too heavy, so I should be fine, or at least until 
the morning,&quot; Whisper replied. &quot;But it does taste good.&quot; 

Darian chuckled as he sipped at his wine. &quot;Just as long as you don&#39;t 
have the same type of reaction Maze had to that loaf of garlic bread 
he ate.&quot; 

&quot;Should we ask?&quot; Alex said as both Luna and Whisper made sour faces. 

&quot;Mina almost made him pitch a tent outside until he was finished,&quot; 
Darian replied with a shrug. &quot;Sad thing was, he was probably in some 
rather serious pain at the time, too.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not fair,&quot; Whisper said with a quiet grunt. &quot;Most denizen foods 
can be eaten by humans with little or no harm.... well, except the 
ones that would usually hurt us as well.... but we can&#39;t eat half of 
the same stuff that you routinely eat without having to worry about 
truly odd side-effects.&quot; 

&quot;Like what?&quot; Alex asked. 

Susan sighed. &quot;Perhaps we should finish eating first,&quot; she suggested. 

The blonde smirked and set her utensils down on her empty plate. 
&quot;Already did,&quot; she said as she picked up her wineglass and sat back. 
&quot;Dinner was very good, Whisper, and not just because I was starving. 
Thanks,&quot; she said, just before she had to stifle a soft belch. 

Susan muttered something cryptic to herself about the upbringing of 
Alex&#39;s immediate ancestors and wondered where she went wrong before 
sighing quietly. &quot;Then perhaps you should relax until the rest of us 
are finished?&quot; she said pointedly. 

&lt;One good thing about telepathy,&gt; Whisper&#39;s voice echoed in their 
minds. &lt;Can&#39;t call it bad manners for thinking with your mouth full&gt; 

Darian tried to suppress a laugh and failed, momentarily spraying Luna 
with a mouthful of wine. He quickly grabbed a napkin and held it out 
to her, trying to look apologetic while still fighting a case of the 
chuckles. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; the black cat said acidly as she grabbed the napkin with 
a paw and tried to clean herself off. 

&quot;Could be worse,&quot; Alex said with a grin. &quot;You could have wound up 
being doused in bright red fruit punch like Artemis that one day.&quot; 

Luna smirked. &quot;That one I remember.&quot; 

Darian finally managed to swallow the wine and gasped for air. &quot;Yeah, 
but you weren&#39;t here for the purple cat incident.&quot; 

&quot;Mina gave Artemis a bath and apparently grabbed a bottle of dye 
instead of the bottle of shampoo,&quot; Luna said with a giggle. 

&quot;Oooh,&quot; Whisper said with a sympathetic wince. 

&quot;I say we dye him green next time we have a party,&quot; Alex said to 
Michelle. 

&quot;Shame on you,&quot; Michelle replied with a faint blush. 

&quot;Actually, I think he&#39;d look better if we gave him black polka-dots,&quot; 
Darian said only half-jokingly. &quot;You know, give him that dalmation 
effect.&quot; 

&quot;Hmmmmm,&quot; Alex said slowly as she narrowed her eyes, trying to conjure 
up the appropriate mental image. &quot;Now that you mention it....&quot; 

Susan just sighed. &quot;I see that getting repeatedly clawed by lunar cats 
in response to such practical jokes has done absolutely nothing to 
deter you from harassing them.&quot; 

Alex shot her a dark look. &quot;I don&#39;t harass them, Sue.&quot; 

&quot;Too often,&quot; Michelle muttered very softly into her wine. 

The blonde nearly fell out of her chair. &quot;What the hell?&quot; she demanded 
as she whirled around. &quot;Mich, who&#39;s side are you on, anyway?&quot; 

Michelle gave her a hurt look and Whisper coughed lightly. &quot;Dessert, 
anyone?&quot; she offered. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d like it, but we still 
have some le&#39;un pudding in the refrigerator.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s the bluish-purple stuff with the consistency of whipped 
cream?&quot; Darian asked as everyone else gave the telepath a blank look. 
Whisper nodded and Darian sat back in his chair. &quot;The density is kinda 
light for most human tastes, but I think it&#39;d go well enough with the 
wine and all.&quot; 

Alex frowned slighty. &quot;What kind of pudding did you say it was?&quot; 

&quot;Le&#39;un berries are grown in the Negaverse,&quot; Darian explained as empty 
plates and silverware started to rise into the air and hover. &quot;They 
make an okay dessert, but it&#39;s awfully light and airy. Kinda like 
trying to eat a fruity cloud.&quot; 

&lt;I beg your pardon&gt; said a slightly offended voice in his mind as the 
fleet of airborne plates and utensils slowly migrated into the kitchen 
sink. 

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad,&quot; Darian protested. &quot;In fact, it tastes 
rather good. But it&#39;s so wispy that the taste is all you&#39;re getting.&quot; 

&lt;It wasn&#39;t meant to be filling, you know&gt; Whisper telepathed back as 
she turned around to keep an eye on the airspace in the kitchen. 
&lt;Dessert is supposed to be a treat for the tastebuds after a meal, and 
how can you eat dessert when you&#39;re too full from dinner?&gt; 

&quot;We manage,&quot; Alex said as she patted her stomach. She chuckled and 
added, &quot;And some people more than others. I can&#39;t recall ever seeing 
the Princess turn down something sugary, even after a full banquet.&quot; 

Susan shook her head. &quot;Which has resulted in her fair share of stomach 
aches at odd hours in the morning,&quot; she replied. &quot;I think the only 
reason the Lady Mercury didn&#39;t forbid her all those sweets was because 
I was usually the one who gave the Princess something in the middle of 
the night instead of her. I think Amelia would only have put up with 
being roused out of bed once or twice before she decided to have a 
word with the Queen.&quot; 

Alex gave her an incredulous look. &quot;You were the one always giving her 
that stuff? The very same Chancellor who once had a quiet but public 
debate with the Queen about how the Princess was being overly 
spoiled?&quot; 

Susan shot her a withering look. &quot;The only reason I was the one giving 
her the medicine was because I was pretty much the only person awake 
at those hours who knew enough about herbs to properly treat her. And 
I assure you the Princess got a lecture every time.&quot; 

&quot;But I&#39;ll bet she still overdosed on the sweets,&quot; Darian ventured. 

&quot;Every chance that cropped up,&quot; Susan muttered sourly. &quot;An event that 
more than a few people took pains to ensure wasn&#39;t all that frequent.&quot; 

&quot;A slow learner?&quot; Luna muttered. &quot;That can&#39;t possibly be our Serena.&quot; 

Her ill-timed sarcasm drew another laugh from Darian as he was 
finishing off his glass of wine, and the resulting explosion of mirth 
had the same unfortunate effect as before. 

Whisper shook her head. &quot;I can get you a bowl if you want to have your 
own share of wine, Luna,&quot; she said lightly as Darian hastily tried to 
clean off Luna&#39;s soaked fur. 

&quot;No, no, I think I&#39;ve had more than enough,&quot; Luna said calmly while 
giving Darian a glare that cast his future health into question. 

Darian coughed lightly. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose offering to give you a bath 
would help matters, would it?&quot; he said cautiously. &quot;I mean one with a 
really thorough scrubbing in warm water, not the thirty-second job 
that Mina gave Artemis that one day.&quot; 

Luna sat back and tried to preen her whiskers. &quot;I&#39;m surprised that she 
healed without scars,&quot; she muttered to herself. 

&quot;Well, tell us what happened,&quot; Alex said, then blinked as a small bowl 
filled with purple froth floated down in front of her. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; 

&quot;Their idea of pudding,&quot; Darian replied, drawing a mild look from 
Whisper. &quot;Anyway, Mina needed to give Artemis a bath for one reason or 
another, but he apparently wasn&#39;t in the mood and threw a fit, so 
after a rather loud and protracted argument she dunked him in the 
toilet and flushed.&quot; 

Alex immediately clamped her hand over her mouth before her sudden 
burst of laughter could spew pudding everywhere. Her free hand pounded 
the table until she could control herself long enough to swallow 
before erupting into peals of laughter. 

&quot;Are you alright, Susan?&quot; Whisper asked curiously. 

Susan just shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t understand.... her mother was a 
very polite and refined lady,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I simply have no idea what 
happened to her daughter&#39;s upbringing.&quot; 

&quot;Who, Mina or Alex?&quot; Darian asked. 

&quot;Both, actually,&quot; Susan said wearily. 

Michelle quickly leaned forward and clamped her hand down on Alex&#39;s 
wrist just as the blonde dug the tip of her spoon into the mass of 
le&#39;un pudding and prepared to flick it at Susan. Alex shot her a dark 
look and Michelle turned pale, slowly shaking her head. 

&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; she said softly. &quot;It&#39;s not worth it.&quot; 

Alex gave her a soft kiss before gently prying her fingers off of her 
wrist. She then licked most of the pudding off of the spoon, leaving 
only a very tiny amount clinging to the tip, before casually flicking 
it at Susan. &quot;You&#39;d be surprised, love,&quot; she said smugly as she looked 
at Susan. &quot;Oh, good, it didn&#39;t hit her hair. That would really have 
sucked.&quot; 

&quot;I assure you, having it &#39;suck&#39; is going to be the very least of your 
immediate concerns,&quot; Susan said with a discernible edge to her voice 
as she picked up a napkin and brushed away the flecks of purple on her 
cheek. 

&lt;Your patience and restraint is admirable&gt; said the voice in her mind. 

&quot;Perhaps you should wait on your admiration,&quot; Susan suggested calmly 
as she finished the rest of her wine. She set her empty glass down and 
stood up, slowly pacing the room as she opened the top button of her 
blouse. &quot;The night is not yet over.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, you need a bath,&quot; Darian said hastily as he scooped up Luna and 
discreetly kept a finger over her lips. &quot;The wine is starting to stain 
your fur. Thank you for dinner, Captain, and if you ladies will excuse 
me, I will see you all in the morning.&quot; 

Alex blinked and watched Darian make a somewhat rapid exit from the 
room. &quot;Huh.... what was his hurry?&quot; she wondered. 

&lt;Probably clearing the battlefield&gt; Whisper telepathed as she slowly 
rose to her feet. &lt;Susan, may I ask what you&#39;re doing?&gt; 

Susan turned her back to them as she removed her blouse, exposing the 
dark scars on her back. &quot;You have interesting aim, Alex,&quot; she said 
evenly as she wiped up the glob nestled between her breasts. &quot;I&#39;m not 
quite sure how you got pudding into my blouse without any of it 
hitting the fabric.&quot; 

&quot;Oops,&quot; Alex said with a faint blush. &quot;I don&#39;t think this is the first 
time you&#39;ve had to clean out the inside of your shirt like that, 
though, since we know you like.... OW! Ow ow ow ow OW!&quot; she yelped as 
she clutched at her head and whimpered. 

&lt;Shame on you for saying such a thing&gt; Whisper telepathed. 

&quot;Ow, goddamn, what the hell was that?&quot; Alex moaned as she leaned 
forward and rested her elbows on her knees, still holding her head 
with both hands. She felt Michelle&#39;s comforting hand gently rubbing 
her back and she sighed. 

&quot;Psi spike?&quot; Susan inquired as she finished her task and rebuttoned 
her blouse. She received a nod and let a faint smirk tug on the 
corners of her lips. &quot;I think you just saved me the trouble of having 
to try to discipline her. Thank you.&quot; 

&lt;That was a rather crude suggestion, even by our standards&gt; 

&quot;I&#39;ve got a suggestion for you,&quot; Alex said as she lifted her head up 
and glared at the telepath. She blinked hard as Michelle suddenly 
wrapped herself around her, clamping both hands over her mouth. 

&quot;We&#39;ve had a rough day and she&#39;s getting tired,&quot; Michelle said 
quickly. Alex said something to her that was almost completely muffled 
and she turned a bright shade of red. 

&quot;That&#39;s quite understandable,&quot; Susan replied, pointedly ignoring the 
dark look she was getting from the blonde. &quot;You should take her to bed 
and try to get some sleep. Tomorrow should be just as interesting as 
today is, so get some rest. Or at least try to,&quot; she added, giving 
Michelle a knowing look. She blushed even harder and whispered 
something in Alex&#39;s ear before she stood up and slowly released her 
mouth. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go, love,&quot; Alex muttered darkly as she stood up and gently took 
Michelle&#39;s hand. 

&quot;Do I want to ask?&quot; Whisper said quietly as she watched them make 
their way down the hall towards their bedroom. 

Susan shrugged. &quot;Best of friends since they bumped heads while 
learning how to crawl. I&#39;m not sure when they became lovers, but 
that&#39;s not really my concern. Michelle keeps Alex out of a fair amount 
of trouble, and Alex gives her the exact type of emotional support she 
needs. An interesting balance, but it works for them.&quot; 

Whisper nodded. &quot;I understand now. And you&#39;re awfully quiet.&quot; 

Susan blinked and was about to reply when she realized that she had 
been looking at Myst when she said it. &quot;Indeed,&quot; she said quietly. 

&quot;You people are strange,&quot; Myst said as she carefully sniffed at 
Susan&#39;s untouched bowl of le&#39;un pudding. 

&quot;We&#39;re not that hard to get used to,&quot; Whisper replied. &quot;I mean, look 
at dinner. A few hours ago, Alex looked ready to slit my throat. Now 
we just got finished sharing a meal and a few jokes.&quot; 

Myst sat back and gave her a weary look. &quot;I resurrected Susan from a 
mere ember of a soul, which in itself is unheard of. Since then, I&#39;ve 
nearly been eaten, had my molecules torn apart and reassembled three 
times, been hunted and chased half-way across The Dark, catapulted 
through a wormhole into a strange land, nearly drowned in a lake, been 
repeatedly held in crushing grips by upset humans, petted like a toy, 
I&#39;m still trying to figure out not only what you people keep talking 
about every ten minutes but why I was brought along in the first 
place, and you say you humans are not hard to get used to?&quot; 

&quot;Somebody needs a nap,&quot; Susan observed with a faint smile. 

Whisper shot her a mild look. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what to tell you, Myst. 
I&#39;m a denizen, not a human, and I can&#39;t speak about what you went 
through earlier. All I&#39;m asking is that you give us some time to get 
to know each other first. And if it&#39;s any consolation, I still get 
confused by humans as well. Umm, no offense, Susan,&quot; she added 
hastily. 

&quot;None taken. I&#39;m only half-human, after all,&quot; Susan replied. 

Whisper frowned lightly as she began to clear the dinner table. &quot;Yes, 
I heard you say that earlier in the hallway. May I ask what the other 
half is?&quot; 

&quot;Demon, although judging from Tolaris&#39; reaction, that probably doesn&#39;t 
mean anything to you,&quot; Susan said. 

&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t,&quot; the telepath replied with a shrug. 

&quot;I&#39;ll explain tomorrow when the others are here,&quot; Susan said as she 
sat down and examined her bowl of denizen pudding. &quot;It&#39;s a fairly 
short story in itself, but the associated background and explanations 
require a long time to spell out. What is this again?&quot; 

&quot;Le&#39;un pudding. The berries only grow in remote parts of the Western 
Forests, and they make wonderful desserts. The berries can also be 
fermented into a rather potent alcohol. Can I ask you a personal 
question?&quot; 

Susan raised a slender eyebrow. &quot;I can&#39;t guarantee an answer.&quot; 

&quot;How old are you?&quot; Whisper asked as she stepped to one side to allow a 
flock of dessert bowls to fly into the kitchen and stack themselves in 
the sink. &quot;If you were a human I&#39;d put your age at twenty-five or so, 
but since you said you were only half-human, I&#39;m just curious about 
the effect on your lifespan.&quot; 

&quot;What would you think if I was a denizen?&quot; Susan said before she took 
a small taste of the pudding. Darian wasn&#39;t kidding about the density, 
she thought with a slight mental shrug. 

Whisper tilted her head to one side. &quot;I&#39;d put it at a quite a bit 
younger than Maze. Call it.... oh, three hundred even.&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t tell you my exact age for several reasons,&quot; Susan said 
slowly, &quot;But I guess you could put me in the same age bracket as 
Tolaris.&quot; 

There was a sharp clattering noise from the kitchen as the last of the 
flying silverware suddenly plummeted into the sink. &quot;You&#39;re seven 
hundred years old?&quot; Whisper said in mild disbelief. 

&quot;Give or take a few decades, yes,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;My demonic heritage 
has given me an eternal lifespan.&quot; 

The telepath blinked hard and slowly sat down. &quot;Wait.... that means 
you can be killed, but not of old age, right?&quot; She received a somewhat 
suspicious look and a slow nod in response, and she sighed to herself. 
&quot;That.... might not be a bad thing, you know. Did you talk to Tolaris 
about Ami yet?&quot; 

Susan sighed. &quot;I know she&#39;s a denizen breed of vampire, but that&#39;s 
about all I know. I take it she&#39;s discovered she has an eternal 
lifespan as well?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, and the poor dear was quite devistated by the news,&quot; Whisper 
said. &quot;Apparently she has both low- and high-level regeneration 
abilities, and that the low-level regeneration is bringing her growth 
rate to a halt. While that in itself is upsetting to her, as is the 
fact that she&#39;ll outlive all her friends and family unless something 
goes wrong, she still has an occasional crying fit when she thinks 
about what it&#39;s doing to her cycle.&quot; 

Susan blinked. &quot;I don&#39;t quite understand what you mean.&quot; 

&lt;She says her menstrual cycle is slowing down and will completely halt 
in three years&gt; Whisper telepathed. &lt;She wants to have children one 
day, but she can&#39;t if her body cycle is shut down&gt; 

Susan&#39;s eyes went wide as the telepath&#39;s words registered on her mind. 
&quot;But.... she has to have a child,&quot; she said, sputtering momentarily in 
her state of shock. &quot;They all do. Their powers as Sailor Scouts can 
only be used while their bodies are still young. Once they reach a 
certain biological age they won&#39;t be able to use their powers anymore. 
Their powers will weaken and fade away unless it is passed down to a 
new generation, and we&#39;ve already lost one bloodline.&quot; 

Whisper shook her head in sympathy. &lt;It gets better. You know she&#39;s in 
love with Tolaris and giving serious thought to being his lifemate, 
despite an age difference measured in centuries. The two problems with 
that are the facts that humans and denizens can&#39;t have children 
together, and that even if they could, Tolaris is sterile&gt; 

Susan pushed her bowl of pudding away and leaned forward to put her 
head down on her arms. &quot;The first part is easy to deal with,&quot; she 
said. &quot;If the Imperium Silver Crystal can do it once, it can do it 
again.&quot; 

&lt;Ami&#39;s not royalty,&gt; Whisper observed. &lt;Luna once warned us how only 
the royal bloodline could command the Crystal, and that Serena doesn&#39;t 
know enough about it at the present to be able to do it&gt; 

Susan stood up and stretched. &quot;Very few people know the truth about 
the Crystal,&quot; she said with a faint smile. &quot;Yes, you do need royal 
blood to be able to command it, and mercy upon the souls of those who 
dare try to command it without being part of the bloodline, but anyone 
can simply ask it to do something. I don&#39;t think it would listen to 
someone who didn&#39;t belong to one of the Houses, but the Crystal has 
been known to listen to reasonable requests under most circumstances. 
As long as you are polite and are acting in the best interests of the 
throne, the Imperium Silver Crystal will usually do what you ask of 
it.&quot; 

&lt;Let&#39;s just hope she doesn&#39;t ask anytime soon,&gt; Whisper thought with a 
mental chuckle. &lt;Ami is a very intelligent young woman and 
surprisingly mature for one so young, but I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;d be 
prepared to deal with having a child. To say nothing of the social 
uproar it would cause&gt; 

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Susan said with a weary sigh. &quot;Idle curiosity.... has any of 
the others expressed an interest in children?&quot; 

The telepath rubbed at a small ache at the base of her neck. &lt;I think 
Serena is looking forward to motherhood just as much as Ami is, maybe 
even more so, but that&#39;s about it. Mina is only somewhat partial to 
the idea and even then only in the distant future. Leda, however, has 
made quite clear her desire to remain childless. I don&#39;t know about 
Rei, however, as we&#39;ve never really had any meaningful discussion 
about anything. If I had to take a guess, however, I&#39;d say she agrees 
with Mina&#39;s mindset of not-now-but-maybe-later&gt; 

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Susan sighed again. &quot;I&#39;m not sure which situation is 
worse, Alex&#39;s resistance to the idea of having a child, or Michelle&#39;s 
desire for a medical breakthrough that would let her conceive a 
daughter with Alex&#39;s DNA.&quot; 

Whisper shrugged. &quot;Well.... roughly three hundred years ago there was 
a report of just such genetic fusions being performed. There were only 
five success stories out of a hundred, I think, and the inital 
reasearch looked promising until the children reached puberty.&quot; 

Susan winced. &quot;The chaos factor?&quot; 

&quot;The conclusion was that natural selection knew which DNA fragments to 
accept and which to reject when recombining at conception,&quot; Whisper 
said with a quiet sigh. &quot;Even after thousands of years of research, we 
still know next to nothing about the chaos genes, let alone what each 
individual sequence of genetic code does. With the forced fusion, it 
was pretty much randomized as to which sequences would be included. 
The end results were.... nightmarish, and a royal ban placed on 
further fusion experiments.&quot; 

Susan sat in silence as she digested the information. &quot;Whisper,&quot; she 
said quietly after a few minutes, &quot;How many pairs of chromosomes do 
denizens have?&quot; 

&quot;Depends on the species,&quot; Whisper said after a moment. &quot;I think both 
felinoids and avians have twenty-nine pairs, but the rest of us only 
possess twenty-eight.&quot; 

&quot;Interesting.... and how many are related to the chaos factor?&quot; 

&quot;We think only two, but we&#39;re not absolutely certain.&quot; 

Susan stood up and slowly began to pace the length of the dining room. 
&quot;I find this very odd and more than slightly disturbing. Humans only 
possess twenty-six pairs of chromosomes, and it seems that the two 
pairs they lack in comparison to denizens is possibly related to the 
chaos factor. I also find it very odd how two unique species could 
have evolved in two completely different environments but yet possess 
an almost identical physical structure. What do you think?&quot; 

&quot;The favorite pet theory is that both humans and denizens have a 
common ancestral link, but one that might go back as far as the first 
multi-celluar creatures in the oceans,&quot; Whisper said casually. &quot;Go 
back in time a billion years and you&#39;ll find that our planet was more 
ocean than land, as yours still is. Very few denizens actually care, 
however, as we&#39;ve had a complex society thousands of years before your 
ancestors first got the idea of drawing on the walls of your caves 
with burnt sticks.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you for the charming comparison,&quot; the succubus said dryly. 

Whisper chuckled. &quot;Didn&#39;t mean to offend you.&quot; 

&quot;Let me postulate a theory for a moment,&quot; Susan said slowly. &quot;If the 
fusion experiments failed because of the chaos factor, then wouldn&#39;t 
they be pretty much viable if a fusion took place between beings 
without the factor?&quot; 

Whisper blinked hard as she considered it. &quot;I&#39;m not a scientist, and I 
only have a passing knowledge of the experiments, what went wrong, and 
why. Your theory would hold true if the chaos factor was indeed the 
sole cause of the failure, but you have to bear in mind there was an 
initial ninety-five percent failure rate.&quot; 

Susan nodded. &quot;I know, I&#39;m just thinking about the possibilities.&quot; 

The telepath raised an eyebrow. &quot;For Alex and Michelle?&quot; 

&quot;No, they both need to have separate children first to pass on their 
bloodline. Once that&#39;s accomplished, there&#39;s no reason Michelle can&#39;t 
have more children as only the first-born daughter will have the 
power. But that&#39;s not why I&#39;m wondering. If Ami and Tolaris want to 
have a child, they&#39;ll need some form of intervention. The same holds 
true for Mina and Maze, and quite possibly Serena and Darian as well.&quot; 

Whisper blinked in surprise before she nodded. &quot;We keep forgetting 
that Serena is half-denizen,&quot; she said. &quot;Although from dealing with 
her, you would never have guessed it. Oh, excuse me,&quot; she said as she 
suppressed a yawn. 

&quot;I&#39;m not keeping you up with this, am I?&quot; Susan inquired lightly. 

&quot;Not really,&quot; Whisper replied. &quot;I mean no offense to the others, but 
it is nice to have an intelligent conversation with another adult 
human now and then. I think I&#39;ve already talked with Ami and Darian 
about as many topics as one can expect someone as young as they are to 
know about.&quot; 

Susan nodded. &quot;I know what you mean. The only non-demon I&#39;ve ever been 
able to compare notes on long lifespans with was Raijen, and we didn&#39;t 
have a lot of time to discuss it.&quot; Whisper chuckled unexpectedly and 
Susan raised a slender green eyebrow. &quot;Is there something amusing 
about that?&quot; 

&quot;I was just remembering the look on Tolaris&#39; face when he was 
confronted by Raijen&#39;s spirit,&quot; the telepath said, still chuckling 
quietly to herself. &quot;The Dragoons pretty much revere him as a 
religious icon. They would probably be in awe of you if you related 
your conversations with Raijen to them.&quot; 

&quot;What about the collective Dragoon reaction to Serena&#39;s heritage?&quot; 
Susan asked carefully. 

Whisper sighed quietly to herself. &quot;We won&#39;t know for sure unless we 
can arrange some sort of official meeting between her and the Legion. 
Tolaris is apparently giving serious thought to having K&#39;tal call a 
mass-formation of all the Dragoons that can possibly show up, then 
having us sneak the Sailor Scouts in for a quiet presentation.&quot; 

&quot;Inside the Negaverse,&quot; Susan said flatly. 

&quot;We figure it&#39;s easier to move ten of us.... well, thirteen now, into 
the Negaverse rather than try to relocate a small army over to Earth,&quot; 
the telepath replied dryly. &quot;And even with as much sneaking around 
they do while gathering information, I think they would still stick 
out like a vep&#39;tera trying to hide in a stand of weeds in the Southern 
Flatlands.&quot; 

Susan tilted her head to one side. &quot;I don&#39;t know how big a vep&#39;tera 
is, but I&#39;ve seen some extremely tall weeds before.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ve never seen the Southern Flatlands. There might be a total of 
four patches of weeds in the entire region, none of which grows higher 
than Luna&#39;s knees. Oh, and your typical forest-dwelling vep&#39;tera is 
probably just a bit taller than you are.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like a charming place,&quot; Susan remarked somewhat dryly. 

Whisper shrugged. &quot;Tolaris calls it home, although I&#39;ve seen worse. 
I&#39;m from the Outreaches, which is pretty much nothing but shallow 
swamps and rather hazardous marshes. How about you?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve spent most of my life in the Moon Kingdom, although I did spend 
a significant amount of time in the Underworld. It exists on three 
levels, and the one I usually inhabited was the one that was primarily 
a lake composed of elemental fire,&quot; the succubus replied. 

&quot;Oooh,&quot; the denizen said as she winced. &quot;I&#39;ve seen a few active 
volcano pits in the Northern Mountains, but nothing like that.&quot; 

&quot;Home is where the heart is. At least, where the Damned gets theirs 
cut out on a regular basis,&quot; Susan said lightly. She watched as 
Whisper&#39;s skin took on a pale blue cast and she raised an eyebrow. &quot;I 
take it you aren&#39;t all that familar with this world&#39;s spiritual 
realities?&quot; 

Whisper shook her head. &quot;Not really, but something tells me I should 
wait until I&#39;ve had a lot of sleep before I ask you to tell me about 
it.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm, sleep,&quot; Susan said quietly to herself before she looked up at 
the gray kitten still silently observing them. &quot;Do you ever sleep, 
Myst?&quot; 

&quot;Rarely,&quot; Myst replied. &quot;I don&#39;t need it, but it does pass the time in 
a somewhat unique way. Dreams bother me, though, so I don&#39;t do it very 
often.&quot; 

Whisper blinked. &quot;Demons don&#39;t sleep?&quot; 

&quot;Not unless they want to,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;However, as I&#39;m still 
partly human, I have a few of their weaknesses, one of which is the 
need for sleep. My constitution isn&#39;t nearly as frail as theirs is, 
though, so only a small nap every other week is sufficient.&quot; 

Whisper rubbed her temples. &quot;No offense, Susan, but to borrow a human 
phrase.... that has got to suck. There have been days in which the 
only thing that kept me going was the promise of a few hours of 
blissful sleep.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t have a problem with it,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;Usually I spend the 
time doing something quiet like reading or painting, or even catching 
up on the stack of paperwork that any administration seems to require. 
I sense that you&#39;re getting tired yourself,&quot; she added. 

The telepath sighed quietly before nodding slowly. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to 
be rude by going to bed and leaving you out here by yourself.&quot; 

Susan smiled. &quot;Actually, a nap sounds good right about now. Time 
travel is only a small strain in itself, but with as much of that as 
I&#39;ve been doing these past.... well, four days in my perspective, but 
the effort is starting to take it&#39;s toll.&quot; 

Whisper nodded in understanding. &quot;And if today wasn&#39;t a strain on 
one&#39;s nerves, then tomorrow should be five times as bad.&quot; 

&quot;Surely it can&#39;t be as bad as meeting us,&quot; Susan suggested carefully. 

&quot;We never knew you before,&quot; Whisper replied slowly. &quot;I have a feeling 
that most of tomorrow&#39;s problems will stem from the difference between 
how you remember them to be and what they are today. A lot can change 
in a thousand years.&quot; 

Susan chuckled unexpectedly. &quot;Tell me about it,&quot; she said dryly. &quot;When 
I chose the spot for our arrival in this city, I was still thinking in 
a 10th century geographical context.&quot; 

Whisper blinked in confusion. &quot;And...?&quot; she prompted. 

&quot;And there wasn&#39;t a lake there a thousand years ago.&quot; 

&quot;I think we all know the results,&quot; the telepath observed. 

&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; grumbled Myst. 

Susan chuckled as she picked up the Shinma. &quot;You got dried out.&quot; 

&quot;After my lungs were flooded with water,&quot; Myst replied. &quot;And I think I 
ate something by accident. All I remember is seeing a cloud of dark 
shapes dart away as I hit the water, then tasted something slimy 
wriggling around.&quot; 

Susan shrugged. &quot;You probably swallowed a small fish, which is no 
major concern since cats eat fish anyway and you would have had some 
reaction by now if you were going to have one at all.&quot; 

&quot;Remind me tomorrow and I&#39;ll check to see if we have any sort of 
denizen fish available for dinner,&quot; Whisper said as she stretched. &quot;It 
would be a good excuse as any to open one of those Southern Flatland 
bottles of wine.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds fair enough. Sleep well, Whisper,&quot; Susan said as she 
readjusted the kitten&#39;s weight in her arms and started walking down 
the hallway towards her bedroom. 

&quot;Do you plan on sleeping?&quot; Myst asked once Susan entered the bedroom 
and closed the door behind her. 

&quot;Actually, yes,&quot; Susan replied as she set the kitten down on the 
table. &quot;As I said, it&#39;s been a rather stressful four days for me.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to sleep,&quot; Myst blurted out suddenly. &quot;Dreams scare me.&quot; 

Susan paused only for a moment before she resumed undressing. &quot;Then 
don&#39;t sleep,&quot; she admonished her. &quot;Just because I&#39;m going to take a 
nap doesn&#39;t mean you have to.&quot; 

The Shinma watched in silence as Susan finished undressing completely 
and reverted to her demonic form. The succubus then spent the next 
several minutes stretching and relaxing various muscles, the faint 
moonlight from the open window turning her wings almost transparent 
and casting her nude body in an ethereal glow. 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be alone,&quot; Myst finally said quietly. 

Susan her demonic ally very carefully, remembering that she had almost 
always been within arm&#39;s reach of her during the three days they spent 
in her keep in the Border Ethereal dimension. &quot;Is your present form 
stable enough to persist even if you fall asleep?&quot; she asked after a 
moment&#39;s thought. 

Myst blinked at the unexpected question. &quot;It should be,&quot; she said 
slowly. 

&quot;Good enough,&quot; the succubus replied as she walked over and picked her 
up. She then moved over to the bed and laid down on her side, flexing 
her wings a few times before folding them neatly against her back. 
Drawing the sheet over her nude body, she carefully cradled Myst 
against her chest and quickly made herself comfortable. &quot;I&#39;m not sure 
I wanted to be alone tonight, either,&quot; she replied quietly in the 
kitten&#39;s ear as her disciplined mind turned inward and methodically 
shut itself down. 

Myst sighed quietly to herself as she listened to Susan&#39;s breathing 
and pulse gradually even out and slow down. She estimated a full 
minute hadn&#39;t passed between Susan&#39;s words in her ear and when she 
slipped into the state of neo-oblivion called sleep. She fought to 
keep herself from shivering at the thought of dreaming, the 
uncontrollable caphony of images and voices that is unleashed by the 
subconscious when the conscious is completely idle. 

A long quiet night, she thought to herself as she squirmed slightly. 
She was neatly wedged between Susan&#39;s breasts with her head almost 
directly above her heart. She flicked her ear down to listen to the 
slow, steady rhythm it produced as it beat inside her chest. 

Such a fragile thing, life, she mused as she listened to the deep 
sound. She knew that right now, she stood an excellent chance of being 
able to stop the heartbeat if she chose to. Such a strange hypnotic 
sound it makes, she began to think. Imagine, sounding like that, day 
after day after day, for hundreds of thousands of days. Over seven 
hundred years of steady rhythm. A strong sound to a fragile existence. 

The gentle pulse of Susan&#39;s heartbeat against her cheek and the slow, 
steady rhythm in her ear continued to comfort her long after she was 
lulled into a timeless, dreamless world of sleep. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

General Rune quietly walked down the seemingly endless maze of 
corridors and cargo bays of the underground storage facility. Situated 
on the decidedly hostile geographical border between the Eastern 
Frontier and the Outreaches, the storage facility wasn&#39;t supposed to 
be underground, but a relatively minor earthquake in the region 
shortly after it&#39;s construction turned the normally hard-packed sandy 
ground into so much quicksand. The end result had been the sinking of 
the entire facility into thirty meters of sand with surpringly few 
casualties. 

Publically the facility had been declared a total loss which led to 
the resignation of the engineer in charge of the project. However, the 
military was able to secretly restore the facility to full operations 
as an annex to the Eastern Division&#39;s array of military depots, not 
all of which were known to exist by many. 

&quot;Is everything ready?&quot; Rune quietly asked over her shoulder as she 
came to a halt in front of a pair of small but heavily reinforced 
doors. 

The imposing figure of Lieutenant General Ra&#39;en grunted quietly from 
behind her. &quot;As you specified,&quot; he replied. 

Rune nodded and reached up for the door control. She paused with her 
fingertips halfway to the panel and cast a glance over her shoulder. 
&quot;Is there something else, Ra&#39;en?&quot; 

Much to her surprise, the massive general shifted his feet nervously 
for a moment. &quot;Do you have to do this, Rune?&quot; he said softly in a 
voice she hadn&#39;t heard from him in ages. He looked up at her with an 
almost pleading look. &quot;I know we can use all the help we can get 
against Nop&#39;tera, but....&quot; 

&quot;But...?&quot; Rune prompted with a slight fealing of unease. 

&quot;I&#39;m worried what this might mean for the Negaverse,&quot; he replied 
slowly. &quot;And I&#39;m also worried about you.&quot; 

Rune blinked with genuine surprise. &quot;Why Ra&#39;en, I&#39;m touched.&quot; 

The Eastern Division commander made a low-pitched huffing noise deep 
in his throat. &quot;If this gets out of hand like I fear it might, then 
we&#39;re all going to be touched, and I don&#39;t mean gently by a ex-lover.&quot; 

General Rune smiled wryly. &quot;Your concern is noted, General, but I&#39;ve 
made a decision on the matter and I expect your full support.&quot; 

&quot;And you will have it,&quot; he replied instantly. &quot;However,&quot; he added as 
she turned to touch the door panel again, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, 
Commander-General, I&#39;d rather not watch this.&quot; 

The silence seemed to stretch on for hours as Rune gazed at her 
ex-lover and subordinate. &quot;Very well, then,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I 
suppose I can deal with him myself. Return to your headquarters and 
monitor the situation with the carriers. I will contact you later 
about the developments.&quot; 

Ra&#39;en bowed to her and left, leaving her alone in the corridor with 
her own dark thoughts and private doubts. Sighing inaudibly to 
herself, she turned back to the door panel and keyed it open. 

She stepped into the room and closed the door behind her, looking 
around the room with a critical eye. The room was furnished with the 
standard issue given to all single senior-grade officers living in 
military quarters, complete with the usual universally-despised color 
of towels hanging on the rack outside the bathroom. We really need to 
change that color, she thought to herself out of pure reflex before 
her gaze settled on the one non-standard item in the room: a large 
shard of crystal with a denizen trapped inside like a mosquito frozen 
in amber. 

Making sure the door was securely locked behind her, she stepped 
forward and placed a hand on the smooth surface of the crystal. The 
chaos factor had given her the power to create, destroy, and 
manipulate the molecular structure of crystalline objects, and it was 
this power that let her form a picture in her mind that was far more 
detailed than what she could have seen with either her eyes or a 
scanning device. 

Rune stood perfectly still for several minutes as her powers wandered 
up and down the crystal, mapping the way it was grown and testing its 
strength. After almost missing it twice, she finally found what she 
was looking for: the exact spot and frequency needed to shatter the 
crystal like glass and free its entombted occupant. 

&quot;I&#39;ll say this for Beryl,&quot; she muttered to herself as she turned her 
focus inward and drew her powers together, &quot;She knew how to create a 
crystal that wasn&#39;t easy to break..... Hah!&quot; she gasped as she 
unleashed her powers on a point on the crystal half the size of a 
pinhead. 

The crystal didn&#39;t so much crack as disintegrate, turning into a large 
pile of molecular dust and tiny, dull-edged shards. Freed from the 
crystalline tomb, the man collapsed to the ground with a ragged moan 
that send a dark chill down Rune&#39;s spine. 

&quot;I imagine you&#39;re a little stiff after being frozen in crystal for 
such a long time,&quot; she said to him. &quot;Try not to move just yet.&quot; 

Much to Rune&#39;s amazement, he managed to partially stand up before he 
collapsed to his knees with another protracted moan. &quot;W.... wa....&quot; he 
began to say, his voice sounding as rough and dry as the minor 
standstorm currently whipping around the terrain above the storage 
facility. 

Rune just shook her head and stepped into the bathroom to get a glass 
of water. &quot;You really are one tough p&#39;tai,&quot; she commented. &quot;Here, this 
should help,&quot; she said as she handed him the glass. 

He almost spilled it before he was able to securely grab the glass and 
down the contents in one gulp, gasping in pain as the water seared his 
raw throat. &quot;Y.... you....&quot; he panted slowly as his blue eyes slowly 
refocused on the world around him. 

&quot;Nice to see you too,&quot; she said as she reached out and brushed his 
blonde hair out of his face. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be cruel, but you look 
like hell.&quot; 

He snarled quietly as he jerked away from her and almost lost his 
balance. The glass went flying out of his hand and shattered on the 
ground as he fought a major internal battle to stand up straight. He 
finally succeeded after Rune grabbed his arm to help steady him. 

&quot;Easy,&quot; she cautioned him. &quot;I&#39;ve seen people who&#39;ve been in far worse 
condition than you after being frozen for half as long inside a normal 
stasis crystal.&quot; 

&quot;H.... have.... to.... re.... report.... to.... to Beryl....&quot; he 
gasped as he steadied himself, seeming to grow stronger and more aware 
with each passing moment. 

Rune sighed and decided to let him have it. &quot;Beryl&#39;s dead, my friend. 
Killed by the Sailor Scouts. Now I&#39;m in charge, but only if I can get 
your help to keep Nop&#39;tera off my back.&quot; 

The mention of the Sailor Scouts was enough to jolt him into 
near-perfect consciousness. &quot;What? The Sailor Scouts killed her?&quot; he 
gasped. &quot;And you said Nop&#39;tera is back?&quot; 

&quot;And they said you weren&#39;t a quick learner,&quot; Rune said without rancor. 

&quot;And you haven&#39;t changed,&quot; he said bitterly as he looked around the 
room. &quot;I suppose it&#39;s obvious that you freed me from Beryl&#39;s wrath, 
but do I want to know why?&quot; 

Rune&#39;s response was the last thing he expected of her. Running her 
hand along the side of his face, she leaned forward and melded her 
lips to his in a fairly passionate kiss. He was about to pass out from 
oxygen deprivation when she pulled back, stared deep into his eyes, 
and murmured, &quot;I need you.&quot; 

He paused and licked his lips, his mind still in a stasis-induced 
haze. &quot;That can be taken several different ways, Rune. I&#39;m listening.&quot; 

Rune wasted no time explaining. &quot;Nop&#39;tera has returned and is trying 
to take over the Negaverse. I&#39;m trying to stop her, but I can&#39;t do it 
alone. I need someone like you to help me.&quot; 

He laughed quietly to himself. &quot;Ah, I knew it. You&#39;ve always had some 
sort of ulterior motive to everything you do. I guess I&#39;d be insulted 
if you didn&#39;t have some sort of reason for this, but....&quot; 

Her eyes flashed an instant&#39;s anger at him. &quot;I&#39;m not doing this just 
because I need your help.&quot; 

&quot;Oh?&quot; he said as he leaned forward until they were almost 
nose-to-nose. &quot;Please, my dear Imperial Guard Captain, enlighten me.&quot; 

She sighed. &quot;You really can&#39;t see what&#39;s under your nose, can you?&quot; 

His gaze was unwavering as he stared at her. &quot;Enlighten me,&quot; he 
repeated. 

The kiss she gave him lasted for quite some time, conveying with it 
the not-so-subtle hint of what the immediate future might be like. 
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ve always wanted to do that,&quot; she said softly to him. 

&quot;You&#39;ve surprised me,&quot; he said after a few moments of silence. 

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be the first time.&quot; 

&quot;True, very true. And how serious are you about this?&quot; 

She raised an eyebrow at him. &quot;Serious enough to thaw you out of what 
most view as a justified punishment,&quot; she replied. &quot;I really do need 
your help.... and for awhile, I really was curious what you were like 
in bed.&quot; 

He blinked at that. &quot;You&#39;ve surprised me again, Rune. I had no idea.&quot; 

She smiled at him. &quot;You were never the brightest.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m touched.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re dirty, actually,&quot; she observed as she gazed at his general&#39;s 
uniform. &quot;You need to take a shower. The hot water will ease your 
stiff muscles as well as clean you up.&quot; 

&quot;And afterwards?&quot; 

Rune smiled up at him. &quot;And afterwards we talk about why I freed you.&quot; 

He smiled for the first time since his entombment in crystal at the 
hands of Queen Beryl. &quot;And which aspect might that be?&quot; he asked 
lightly as he looked at her for the first time in a new light. 

&quot;First thing&#39;s first, Jedyt,&quot; she replied. &quot;Get out of those clothes 
and take a shower. Something tells me that tonight is going to be a 
surprise for a lot of people, and not just you....&quot;
