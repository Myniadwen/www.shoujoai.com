Usagi&#146;s &amp; Seiya&#146;s Late Night Romance 

&#147;She really said that?&#148; Yaten asked. &#147;Yes, so that means I still have 
a chance!&#148; Seiya said standing up. &#147;Oh sit down before you create more 
attention than you did this morning!&#148; Taiki said. &#147;What&#146;s your 
problem?&#148; Seiya asked. &#147;When we were supposed to act natural when we 
came back to Jyuban, but no&#133;You kicked down the door and shouted 
&#145;We&#146;re back!&#146; at first period!&#148; 

&#147;Well I was glad to be back&#133;&#148; 

&#147;But did you have to kick down Mr. Aki&#146;s door?&#148; 

&#147;No I guess not.&#148; 

&#147;Well now that Usagi&#146;s available&#133;&#148; Seiya said with a seductive grin on 
her face. &#147;Seiya if Usagi-chan didn&#146;t get it then what makes you think 
she&#146;s gonna get it now?&#148; Yaten asked. &#147;Because I&#146;m gonna make her 
mines even if it kills me!&#148; 

&#147;It probably will&#133;&#148; Taiki said to herself. &#147;I heard that.&#148; Seiya said. 
&#147;That&#146;s nice.&#148; 

&#147;Taiki was that sarcasm I heard?&#148; Yaten asked. 

&#147;So Usagi-chan, what&#146;s it like living with Seiya-chan?&#148; Makoto asked. 
&#147;Well, I duno she&#146;s more normal than when she was here last.&#148; Usagi 
answered. &#147;What do ya mean &#145;normal?&#148; Minako asked. &#147;Well she doesn&#146;t 
bug me like she use to. She&#146;s more normal.&#148; Everyone gave Usagi a 
strange look, &#147;You still don&#146;t get it do you?&#148; Makoto asked. &#147;Get 
what?&#148; 

&#147;Nope.&#148; Ami answered for Usagi. &#147;Say Ami-chan now that you&#146;re talking 
how did your night with Taiki-san go?&#148; Minako asked. &#147;You&#146;re nasty 
Minako-chan.&#148; Usagi said. 

&#147;What about you and Yaten-chan?&#148; Ami asked. &#147;She refused all my 
advances as usual.&#148; Minako answered, &#147;There&#146;s nothing else to say.&#148; 

&#147;Well Ami-chan tell us what DID go on last night. It doesn&#146;t have to 
be ecchi or anything.&#148; Usagi said. &#147;Nothing happened!&#148; 

&#147;What did your mother say?&#148; 

&#147;My mother was at work!&#148; 

&#147;But does she know?&#148; 

&#147;Of course she knows. I had to tell her.&#148; 

&#147;I guess I should tell my parents before they get back too.&#148; Usagi 
said. 

That night a storm was coming and the wind had already knocked the 
power out. Usagi didn&#146;t like storms or the dark, but she reminded 
herself that she had Seiya and Luna with her. Call me crazy, but I 
kinda like being in a dark house with Seiya. Not knowing what&#146;s going 
to happen next&#133; Then a flash of lightening broke her thoughts. She 
jumped when a hand touched her shoulder, &#147;Odango it&#146;s me.&#148; Seiya said. 
Usagi turned around she could barely she her, &#147;Don&#146;t sneak up on me 
like that!&#148; she said. &#147;Sorry.&#148; 

Usagi thought it would be safer if they went to her room where there 
was a less likely chance that Seiya would &#145;sneak up&#146; on her. They were 
sitting on Usagi&#146;s bed when Seiya broke the silence, &#147;I hate to ask 
this, but what happened between you and Mamoru- san?&#148; 

&#147;It&#146;s ok Seiya-chan. A few days after you left I found phone numbers 
in Mamoru&#146;s room in books behind things. You name it, it was there. 
Then he got mad at me because I wouldn&#146;t sleep with him. Then the next 
thing I knew we were breaking up and I haven&#146;t seen him since. The 
others don&#146;t know about it and I told them that he had gone back to 
America which he did. In a way I&#146;m glad he&#146;s gone.&#148; Usagi said. 

&#147;Odango why did you want me to come live with you?&#148; Seiya asked 
nervously. &#147;One reason I&#146;m glad that he&#146;s gone is because I can be 
with you now. I want you Seiya and I know that you once felt the same 
way for me. But is it too late?&#148; Usagi asked. Seiya&#146;s heart must have 
done a million back flips just then. Without holding back she leaned 
forward and kissed Usagi deeply on the lips. Usagi slid her fingers 
between Seiya&#146;s and laid down not breaking the kiss. 

[CM] 

Seiya&#146;s lips moved towards Usagi&#146;s neck. Usagi moaned as she guided 
Seiya&#146;s free hand under her bra and rest it on top of her breast. 
Shocked Seiya stopped kissing Usagi and looked at her suspiciously. 
Usagi lifted her head and pressed her lips against Seiya&#146;s. She 
threaded her legs between Seiya&#146;s and unzipped her shirt and pushed it 
off her shoulders. Seiya shivered a bit when she felt Usagi&#146;s hands on 
her bare arms. Seiya lifted up Usagi&#146;s shirt and began planting kisses 
on her stomach. 

Usagi looked out the window to see the storm getting worse, but 
quickly turned her attention back to Seiya. Seiya beckoned her up so 
that she was sitting in her lap. Soon after removing each-other&#146;s 
bras&#133;and Usagi&#146;s shirt. Usagi began to pleasure her lover by moving 
her tongue around Seiya&#146;s nipple and rolling the other between her 
fingers. 

Seiya was loving this. Only in her dreams this would happen. She soon 
found herself lying on the bed with Usagi on top. Usagi removed her 
pants and slipped her hand under her now wet panties. Seiya gasped 
when she felt Usagi&#146;s fingers inside her. Usagi moved up and kissed 
Seiya&#146;s neck, &#147;Tell me you want me Seiya.&#148; she said. &#147;I want you 
Odango. Ohh Odango&#133;go deeper!&#148; Seiya felt herself about to peek, 
&#147;You&#146;re so good! Ooo Usagi&#133;harder!&#148; 

Usagi&#146;s fingers were replaced by her own womanhood which also needed 
attention. She pulled on Seiya&#146;s hair as she felt her own pleasure 
rising. Seiya pushed Usagi&#146;s lower half against her&#146;s as her body 
began moving in rhythm with her&#146;s. Usagi couldn&#146;t hold out any longer 
her grip on her hair lightened as she came. Seiya soon followed 
calling out Usagi&#146;s name. Usagi&#146;s body collapsed onto her lover&#146;s. She 
rested her hands on her chest and looked out the window again, &#147;Hey 
Sei-chan, the storm&#146;s over.&#148; she said softly. 

Soon after they when asleep Usagi&#146;s communicator began beeping. Usagi 
groaned and answered the call not caring weather they saw her and 
Seiya naked or not. It was Ami, &#147;Usagi-chan we need you and Seiya&#146;s 
help in downtown Tokyo.&#148; she said. &#147;Ok, I&#146;ll be there.&#148; Usagi said. 
She really didn&#146;t want to wake Seiya up, but she had to, &#147;Sei-chan 
wake up.&#148; 

&#147;What?&#148; Usagi told her what Ami had said and the two got out of bed. 

&#147;MOON CRYSTAL&#133;&#148; 

&#147;FIGHTER CRYSTAL STAR&#133;&#148; 

&#147;MAKE-UP!&#148; 

When the two senshi reached their destination they did their intro. 
&#147;What took you so long!?&#148; Healer asked, &#147;And why is your hair fucked 
up?&#148; 

&#147;That&#146;s none of your business.&#148; Fighter said and took off one of her 
star earrings, &#147;STAR CRYSTAL DUST!&#148; she shouted and threw her earring. 
The star grew bigger and hit the youma. The star disintegrated its 
arms and legs. &#147;Damn&#133;&#148; the other senshi said. &#147;Your turn Sailor Moon.&#148; 
Fighter said. 

&#147;Right. GOLDEN STARMOON LOVE POWER!&#148; Sailor Moon shouted and destroyed 
the monster. &#147;Uh Sei-chan we better get going.&#148; Moon said. &#147;Why?&#148; 
Fighter asked. Then it came to her. As soon as they de-transformed 
they would be naked again. Her eyes widened at that thought. &#147;You&#146;re 
right Odango&#133; uh bye guys!&#148; she said and the two left quickly. 

As soon as they were back in Usagi&#146;s house they were nude again, &#147;Hey 
Sei-chan you up for a shower? I got toys.&#148; Usagi said. </pre>
