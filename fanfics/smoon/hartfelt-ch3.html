<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 3 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><p>“Speechless? Well, welcome to your first war... <i>Princess</i>.”</p><p>Both Minako and 
Rei took notice of the change in the flute’s tone. The sound came as a single, piercing 
blast.</p><p><i><b>Tweet!</b></i></p><p><i>So, she’s finally getting serious!</i> Rei 
inwardly smirked. On the far side of the battlefield she could also see her opponent openly 
smirking back. It was obvious that the Uranus leader had no intention of concealing her 
excitement.</p><p>Minako, on the other hand, wished she could say she was as enthusiastic 
about the battle as the two commanders were, but, sadly, she wasn’t. The woman unconsciously 
shuffled her weight between her feet.</p><p><i>I have a bad feeling about this…</i> She 
secretly hoped no one could sense her uneasiness. She knew full well that she would look 
ridiculous amongst the fearless Martian Army if they knew. In fact, it would be considered 
down-right insulting; even though she was from another planet, she was still wearing their 
armor and was walking alongside these great soldiers. If she flubbed this up, she feared 
that she would never live such an embarrassment down. The prospect of being ridiculed or 
having other people point fingers at her in a taunting way just didn’t appeal to 
her.</p><p>Perhaps it was the suit of armor or perhaps she had been standing in the sun for 
too long, but the Venusian was starting to feel light-headed and dizzy. As Minako tried to 
bat away the oncoming nausea, her thoughts began to wander in her moment of weakness; they 
burrowed deep inside her soul, delving further and further against her wishes but she 
couldn’t stop it. She suddenly felt lost and confused, until, finally, all concern about how 
sick she felt was swept away like a leaf in the wind. Her conscious thought had reached the 
door of its goal, the very thing that the woman had kept locked away in the furthest 
recesses of her mind.</p><p><i>This is…</i> Minako blinked and she found herself in front of 
a tightly bolted, metal door.</p><p>Back on the battlefront, Rei’s eyes flickered back over 
to her new charge only to see a vacant expression plastered all over her 
face.</p><p>“There’s nothing to be afraid of. After you’ve seen one war they’re all the 
same.” Rei tried to tell her. But when Minako didn’t respond, Rei grew suspicious that the 
condition was inspired by more than simple fear. “Minako. Minako!” The raven-haired woman 
called sternly. Again there was no response other than light trembling.</p><p>Rei glanced 
back at her troops behind them, seeing them all watch her silently. Their outward appearance 
hadn’t changed since they had set off for the battle but Rei could sense the mild pique of 
curiosity.</p><p><i>They aren’t concentrating on the battle! </i>Rei mentally scolded, then 
looked back to Minako. <i>Because...of her. </i></p><p>She needed to resolve the problem and 
quick. That was when a solution sprung to mind.</p><p><b>SLAP!</b></p><p>“Wha--?” Minako 
blinked and her hand reflexively came up to touch the bright, red mark imprinted on her left 
cheek. She looked to Rei for some explanation, and shivered at the icy, detached gaze 
directed at her.</p><p>“Don’t… ignore me.”</p><p>Despite the stinging on her cheek, Minako 
felt like she had been hit with a bucket of ice cold 
water.</p><p><i>I…</i></p><p><i><b>TWEET!</b></i></p><p>Uranus’s Army suddenly bolted into a 
full out charge, drawing Rei’s attention back to the field. She noted how Haruka wasn’t 
wasting any time to send out all of her soldiers into the first wave.</p><p><i>What is she 
planning? Why is she sending them all at once?!</i></p><p>It wasn’t an uncommon strategy in 
war. It was easier to wear the enemy down by sending soldiers out in waves, weakening the 
other side down until a final wave could completely wipe them out. What Uranus was doing was 
completely illogical. However, even as the golden army barrelled down towards them, the 
Martian soldiers steadily remained at their posts. Minako couldn’t understand why no one was 
doing anything. The ground was practically vibrating beneath her boots.</p><p><i>Wait a 
minute. </i>Rei’s ears pricked up upon hearing something else in the wind. <i>So, that’s 
it!</i></p><p>Rei lifted her right hand into the air and gestured to the troops behind her. 
Next, she withdrew her sword. Its long, sharp blade reflected light as it was drawn out, 
right down to its hilt. The hilt was made with the same color of the Martian Army’s armor 
and it bore the planet’s insignia as virtually all else on the planet. However any bystander 
would immediately notice the difference of the two comparisons; the massive power that the 
blade radiated, it surely couldn’t have been made from ordinary scraps of metal.</p><p>Still 
in shock, Minako wasn’t prepared for the next thing she saw. Rei suddenly broke towards the 
sea of gold alone!</p><p>“Rei!” Minako shouted.</p><p><i>What is she doing?!</i></p><p>When 
she tried to take off after the woman, three Martian medics cut off her path and shook their 
heads at her in disapproval. Despite the humiliation she suffered at the hands of the 
Martian leader moments before, she certainly didn’t wish for her death!</p><p>“What do you 
think you’re doing?! Get out of my way! You can’t possibly expect her to fight them all by 
herself!”</p><p>“Lady Venus, please calm down…” One of the male medics nervously 
said.</p><p>“Don’t you dare tell me to ‘calm down’ you-” she paused, and then did a double 
take at the man in front of her. “Wait, you’re… you’re that attendant who showed me in when 
I first arrived.”</p><p><i>He’s the ‘Ares fan boy’.</i> She realized (though, she doubted 
she would ever forget something like that).</p><p>“Yes, that’s right! I’m happy that you 
remembered me.” The man beamed. “My name is Zen. Although, I’m guessing that introductions 
are probably the last thing you want to do right now.”</p><p>“RAAAAAAH!”</p><p>Minako’s ears 
were nearly deaf with the roar of soldier’s cries.</p><p>“Who in their right mind would?!” 
She snapped back. “This is serious! Don’t any of you have any common sense? Even if Gods and 
Goddesses are immortal, they can still die in battle!” There was an uncomfortable silence 
amongst the troops and the three medics. Thinking that she was perhaps making progress, 
Minako pressed on. “Is that what you want? Do you want your leader to die?”</p><p>They 
turned their heads away.</p><p>“Hey, I’m talking to 
you!”</p><p><i><b>TWEET!</b></i></p><p>This time it was not the flute but a whistle that hit 
the air, and it came from the Martian leader. The two sections of the army that had split 
off just short of the battlefield now re-appeared atop of the sand dunes on either side of 
the opposing army. Surprised shouts and shocked warnings flew through the air, but the 
golden-clad soldiers were having difficulty stopping their momentum. They were virtually 
sitting ducks as the Martians pierced their ranks from both sides.</p><p>“It…it was 
planned?” The words stumbled out of Minako’s mouth. <i>Oh man, did I just make a fool of 
myself again? I am really, really bad with this war stuff. </i>She groaned.</p><p>“That it 
was.” Zen laughed. “But I wouldn’t let our guards down quite yet…”</p><p>“Hm? What do you 
mean?”</p><p>“Just do as Commander said and stay close to us.” As soon as the words left his 
mouth the central Martian army then formed a circle around them. All of the soldiers faced 
outwards in various directions.</p><p>Down on the main battlefield, with a rare smirk Rei 
gave another signal and a wave of her outermost troops from the central group joined the 
fight. If one were to look down from the sky above the feuding armies, the three sections of 
red resembled something like the jaws of an animal closing down upon its prey. And they 
clashed.</p><p><i><b>Clang!</b></i></p><p>“Damn it!” Haruka yelled. She too then moved to 
join her troops below. <i>I was hoping that if I stayed above I would be able to pick this 
sort of plan up before it happened!</i> She then took a course of immediate action to aid 
her soldiers.</p><p>“Taaaaake, THIS!” She 
cried.</p><p><i><b>WOOOOOOOOOSH!</b></i></p><p>Haruka swung down her sword and a stream of 
wind ripped a path through the red soldiers. But they kept on coming and with them, 
Rei.</p><p>Rei closed the distance between herself and Haruka fast. 
“HAAA!”</p><p><i><b>CLANG!</b></i></p><p>Haruka had parried Rei’s attack split seconds 
before they brought their swords together again.</p><p><i><b>Ting! Ting! 
Zwip!</b></i></p><p>“That was quite the stunt you pulled there!” Haruka grunted out through 
a grimace as she pushed back against Rei’s attack. “Grrrah!”</p><p>Rei shuffled-stepped back 
as her opponent lunged and made five consecutive swings in a row, each narrowly missing the 
Martian. The sixth and last one however nicked Rei’s cheek and drew a small trickle of 
blood.</p><p><b>Zwip!</b></p><p>“That’s one!” Uranus’s commander proudly 
grinned.</p><p><i>Geh…!</i> Rei slid back against the sand and fought for balance. Haruka 
may be impulsive and reckless, but she was still taller than she was and had quite a bit of 
power to spare.</p><p>“Hah!” Rei counterattacked the charging blonde by swinging her sword 
in an upward vertical motion and forced the woman to leap back. By the time her opponent 
re-established contact with the ground, the raven-haired woman had already lunged in pursuit 
and promptly made a diagonal side slash. Unfortunately for Haruka the attack hit its mark 
and made a cut into her arm through the small break in her armor. The attack, however, had 
also hit a fundamental strap, knocking the arm guard clean 
off.</p><p><b>Zwap</b>!</p><p>“Even!” Rei declared with a huff of breath.</p><p>Haruka 
maneuvered into a safe distance between herself and Rei before she narrowed her dark green 
eyes. Both leaders were aware of their troops battling all around them but they both held 
their positions and stared the other down.</p><p><i>Nice accuracy. As I expected, she’s 
gotten better. </i>“Heh. Perhaps I took you too lightly after all!”</p><p>Rei immediately 
grew suspicious of Haruka’s attitude. <i>Did I hear right, or is my hearing going? Why did 
she just admit to a fault? Not only is it against her nature but a leader should never admit 
a mistake!</i></p><p>“Your point is?” She narrowed her eyes suspiciously.</p><p>“Oh…It’s 
nothing.” The woman waved nonchalantly. “But I <i>do</i> hope your blonde friend up there 
will be all right.”</p><p><i><b>TWEEEEET!</b></i></p><p>The wind picked up and another 
series of clashing rang through the air. Rei whipped her head around just in time to see her 
main central group mingling with a color of gold.</p><p>“A second squad?” Rei 
whispered.</p><p><i>Where did they come from?!</i></p><p>She could barely make out Minako in 
the crowd. The woman was being guarded by the three medics as planned but she was looking 
extremely stressed. Briefly their eyes met.</p><p>Rei gritted her teeth; Haruka wouldn’t go 
that far would she? Did she even know that she was planning on attacking a diplomat from 
another planet?</p><p>“Pay attention, I’m right here!” Rei barely had time to lift her sword 
against the tall blonde.</p><p><i><b>Ting!</b></i></p><p>“Augh!”</p><p>“You shouldn’t be 
turning your attention away from your opponent!”</p><p>“And you shouldn’t be going after a 
diplomat!” Rei spat back.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“That ‘blonde’ you were talking about isn’t 
from Mars. She’s Aphrodite’s daughter, you impulsive, dim-witted moron! She’s here on a 
visit!”</p><p>“Is that so…?” Haruka darkly muttered. “Oh 
well.”</p><p><i>Huh?!</i></p><p>“Then I guess you’ll just have to do something about that 
now, won’t you?”</p><p>Both combatants’ faces drew close as they leaned into their 
swords.</p><p>“You won’t stop them?” Rei hissed between exhausted breaths.</p><p>“I can’t.” 
Haruka whispered back. “You should know that better than anyone else. If there is no 
apparent reason to withdraw then it’s all over. Uranus’s people take great pride in their 
strength. With our long-standing rivalry and all, these fights with Mars are especially 
important in their eyes! Simply withdrawing won’t cut it.”</p><p>“Hmph, like you’ll need to 
worry about that! Do you even know how much longer you have to live? It can happen at any 
time. HER too! Anyone could be next!”</p><p>Haruka lowered her gaze. “I know that, 
but…”</p><p>“But what?! What kind of excuse did you make up this time? You can’t keep 
running from this, Haruka!”</p><p>Rei involuntarily bit her tongue when her friend looked 
her straight in the eye.</p><p>“Rei. Hino Rei, my long time friend… We’ve found it-- one 
half of the key.”</p><p>The Martian flinched. “What? What in the name of Mars are you 
babbling about now?”</p><p>“You know what I’m talking about. It’s <i>not</i> just a rumour, 
we can do this! This isn’t some wild dream anymore.”</p><p>Rei felt her heart skip a beat. 
“A-Are you serious Haruka?”</p><p><u>(At the Second Front)</u></p><p><i>Rei...</i> Minako 
nervously glanced back at the two leaders caught in a deadlock. She was so caught up in her 
thoughts that she didn’t notice the glint of gold behind her.</p><p>“I’ve got you now, 
Martian SCUM!”</p><p>“Watch out!” Zen shouted. There was a quick flurry of movements before 
the enemy’s corpse lifelessly slumped to the ground. Small droplets of red hung in the air 
as the body fell, seeming to fall in slow motion before Minako’s 
eyes.</p><p><i><b>Thud.</b></i></p><p>“Z-Zen,” Minako was having difficulty finding her 
voice. “But you’re a medic, aren’t you...?”</p><p>The Venusian Princess felt a chill seeping 
into her as she watched her enemy’s blood stain the pale-red sand. The image disturbed her. 
Seeing so much death, even as it was happening all around her, it never really sunk in. But 
now that she was seeing it up close, it was very real.</p><p>“I don’t understand. Aren’t you 
supposed to…?”</p><p>“Save lives?” He finished her sentence and gave a slight bow his head, 
willing his long dark-brown hair to fall over his shadowed eyes. For a moment his face was 
twisted in pain.</p><p>“A medic in the Martian army isn’t just a healer. We are also elite 
<i>killers</i>. Normal soldiers are trained to have impeccable fighting skills, but to be a 
medic, or also known as part of the elite soldier class, we must be strong soldiers with 
knowledge of healing as well.” He took a deep breath as if to strengthen his resolve. 
“Sometimes... we must kill to save lives. I just saved yours. Isn’t that good 
enough?”</p><p>Hearing the partially concealed pain in his voice calmed Minako down a bit. 
She understood now.</p><p><i>Watching someone killing another being, and doing the deed 
yourself, are two completely different things…</i></p><p>“And please. I know I shouldn’t be 
saying this, but I’m begging you to forgive the Commander for laying her hand on your cheek 
earlier! I’m not sure what the situation was, but by military code, if a soldier shows 
disobedience and they are not disciplined, the troops may lose confidence in their leader. 
Since you are dressed like one of us, many expect you to abide by our customs. That’s why 
the Commander did what she did. It was a show of respect- not just to us, but to you as 
well.”</p><p>Minako gave a slight nod of her head, and then stood up to face the battle once 
more.</p><p>“…I understand. Thank you for telling me that.”</p><p><u>(The First 
Front)</u></p><p>At a distance away, Rei was still caught up in Haruka’s words.</p><p><i>She 
actually found it? ...But how?</i></p><p>Before Rei could inquire about the matter further 
Haruka grunted, “I can only hope... that you’re up for some more babysitting! YaH!” She gave 
a final push into her sword to once again create a distance between them.</p><p>Snapping 
back to reality, Rei dug her back heel into the sand and shot instinctively forward for one 
final blow. Haruka followed the action with equally vicious intent. They crossed paths and 
passed each other.</p><p><b>SLASH!</b></p><p>The air around them warped and stilled as if 
time itself were frozen. The two combatants held their finishing movement and waited for the 
blow to make itself known.</p><p><i><b>Splut- 
SHHHHHHHH!</b></i></p><p>“Gah!”</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Rei was the first one to discover her 
wound. She felt the warm blood staining her hand from her side, but she was not ashamed; 
Haruka was a good fighter, and she had received a similar wound.</p><p>“It’s a draw.” Rei 
coughed.</p><p>“Yeah, I guess so.” Haruka closed her eyes as she tried to hold back her own 
painful gasping of breath.</p><p>With that both leaders simultaneously whistled and 
commanded their armies to retreat.</p><p>The soldiers all looked up to see the end result of 
the day and saw that they would surely meet again for a final outcome in the future. As 
Uranus retreated the Martian soldiers honourably obeyed their end of the deal and allowed 
their opponents to walk away with their backs turned.</p><p>“Haruka,” Rei winced from her 
wound.</p><p>“I’ve left it in that place. You know where it is. Please take care of it until 
the next time we meet. Until then, I’ll see you later.”</p><p>Rei waited until Haruka was 
out of sight before she trudged back with her own troops, back to where Minako was 
waiting.</p><p><i>That place huh?</i></p><p>“Commander!” Zen nearly tripped over himself to 
rush to her side.</p><p>Minako also gasped. “Rei, you’re hurt!”</p><p>“Hm?” Rei blinked 
twice before looking back down at her wound. Instead of the usual pain that came with it, 
Rei couldn’t help but feel nostalgic.</p><p><i>Haruka…she really got me good this time. That 
troublesome woman…</i></p><p>“It’s nothing serious.”</p><p>“But---!” Zen tried to 
protest.</p><p>In a firmer voice Rei growled, “Forget about it. There are more important 
matters to take care of! What’s our estimated casualty count?”</p><p>“We think one to two 
hundred.” The medic reluctantly answered. <i>I hate it when she does this! Even though she 
says her wound is fine it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. Leaders!</i></p><p>“I see. Well, you 
know what to do with the bodies. Please see to it that they receive a proper burial. You are 
dismissed.”</p><p>“Yes ...Sir.”</p><p>Minako quietly watched Zen walk away before she 
whirled on Rei. “Okay, what the hell did you do that for? All he wanted to do was help 
you!”</p><p><i>I don’t have time for this. </i></p><p>“There’s something that I need to take 
care of. I’ll have a few of the medics guide you back to the palace.”</p><p>“Hold it! You 
aren’t going anywhere until I get an answer.” She caught Rei’s arm stubbornly, to which Rei 
immediately pulled out of the blonde’s grip.</p><p>“An answer? For what?!” She 
glared.</p><p>“Look, maybe you’re putting too much of yourself into this whole leader image. 
If someone offers you help, then take it! That wound isn’t going to go away by 
itself.”</p><p>“No thanks.”</p><p>“Listen, you! I’m not leaving until you give me a GOOD 
answer.” Minako persisted.</p><p>Rei coughed again before she wearily relented.“Then I guess 
you’re stuck with me for a while longer. But if you insist on coming along then you better 
be ready for some exercise!”</p><p><i>Oh, I’ll get an answer from you yet! </i>Minako vowed. 
<i>With everything that’s happened though... I think I’m finally starting to learn something 
about her.</i></p><p><u>(Desert)</u></p><p>The pair walked away from the dissipating army 
and ventured far into the desert. All around them, as far as the eye could see, they were 
surrounded by miles of sand dunes. What were they supposed to be looking for out here? What 
was important enough to make the stubborn Martian commander wander off into the desert 
<i>wounded</i>?</p><p>From one glance Minako could tell that Rei wasn’t fairing as well as 
she had so boldly claimed earlier.</p><p>“Hey, Rei...? Maybe you should slow down and try to 
take it easy.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous!” The Martian snapped back.</p><p><i>If it is what 
Haruka says it is, then </i><i>I’ve got to find it. Fast.</i></p><p>“What are we doing out 
here anyway?”</p><p>Silently Rei kept leading them further through the hot sun. It was 
becoming so hot that, at one point, Minako even considered shedding her armor. Tentatively 
she began to tug at her arm guards.</p><p>“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” Rei muttered 
off-handedly.</p><p>“Eh? But why not? It’s boiling hot out here!”</p><p>“Becaaaussse... that 
armor is especially made for desert-like conditions. If you take it off, you’ll quickly find 
this place to be three times hotter than you think it is now.”</p><p>“Irk.”</p><p>“Anyway, 
we’re almost there.”</p><p>Minako glanced around. “What do you mean ‘we’re almost there’? 
Almost where? I don’t see anything. All there is is sand, sand and more sand.”</p><p>“You 
didn’t notice them then.” Rei uncharacteristically chuckled.</p><p>“Notice what?” Minako 
huffed. <i>I hate it when she treats me like a kid!</i></p><p>“The flowers.” Rei bent down 
and shifted aside a handful of sand to reveal a small, red flower. It was even redder than 
the sand surrounding it.</p><p><i>Ooooh, I see it now.</i> Minako silently awed as she bent 
down for a closer look. It surprised her at how gently Rei treated the plant.</p><p>“These 
flowers grow in paths that almost look like rivers. In a sense, they ‘flow’ all around the 
planet. In Martian lore, it is said that they are the souls of fallen warriors because they 
flourish especially after battle. Other than that... no one has been able to come up with 
another explanation of why these flowers are able to grow in a desert like 
this.”</p><p>“They’re so pretty...”</p><p>Rei nodded. “Mhm. The place that we’re going to is 
at the heart of this stream. It’s still a bit of a walk from here but if we hurry we’ll be 
there in no time.”</p><p>Again the two moved forward, passing more of the flowers as they 
made distance. It wasn’t until sometime later that a figure came into view. Rei was the 
first to notice it.</p><p>Gesturing with one hand, the woman motioned Minako to stop. “I’ll 
need you to stay here, all right? I’ll go check it out.”</p><p>“What? By yourself? No way! I 
don’t care if you’re this planet’s leader, you’re <i>still</i> injured!”</p><p>“But I have 
more experience with surprise attacks than you do. Even if I’m…inhibited, I’ll still 
survive. Besides, if you were forced to fight do you really think you could take a 
life?”</p><p>The comment caught Minako off-guard. Unable to answer the question, the 
Venusian reluctantly found herself left behind as Rei went off to inspect the figure up 
ahead.</p><p>She was able to momentarily distract her frustration by watching flower petals 
that had been swept up by the light breeze.</p><p><i>The wind...It feels so nice! Where did 
this breeze come from? </i>She wondered.</p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup.</b></p><p>Up ahead, the 
Martian commander’s footsteps slowed to a stop.</p><p><i>...What? Is this a joke, 
Haruka?</i></p><p>Rei’s eyes were widening in shock as she analyzed the curled up figure in 
the bedding of flowers.</p><p>“You left me a kid?”</p><p>From what Rei could see, the child 
was a young girl- barely five, perhaps. She was wearing a set of dark, slightly baggy 
clothes and had short, dark hair to match. Within a few seconds, sensing Rei’s presence, the 
girl opened her eyes to reveal a pair of dark, purple eyes.</p><p>The Martian Commander eyed 
the child warily as she pushed herself up into a sitting position and stared back at her, 
tilting her head at her with great curiosity. She didn’t know what to think.</p><p><i>This 
child… Could she be an orphan?</i></p><p>Surely Haruka wouldn’t abduct a kid on a simple 
whim; the Martian highly doubted that the wind ruler had the heart to tear someone away from 
their family, especially a child.</p><p>“Do you have a name?”She asked the 
girl.</p><p>“Hotaru.” The girl said cutely. She looked like she was about to fall asleep any 
minute. “Where’s papa? Are you... Auntie Rei?”</p><p>Rei felt a few strands of her hair 
stick out of place again.</p><p>“W-WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME?!”</p><p><i>Haruka... the next 
time I see you, I’m going to kill you for real!</i></p><p>“Awww, she’s so cute!” Minako 
squealed. Before Rei could blink the woman was hanging all over her shoulder. “You can call 
me Auntie Minako.”</p><p>“What a second. What do you think you’re doing? We still don’t know 
anything about her!”</p><p>“Oh, pish posh Rei. She’s only a kid. What harm could she 
do?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>Hotaru gave a big yawn. “Sweepy…”</p><p>“Awwww! You’re so cute that I 
could just give you a big h---OOF!” Minako tried to give Hotaru a large hug but she tripped 
over Rei’s foot (which had been conveniently placed in her way) and did a face plant with 
the ground.</p><p>“Ouch! Okay, what did you do that for? I wasn’t going to hug YOU, you 
know?”</p><p><i>Since you’d probably just throw out your hand at the last minute again. My 
nose is still sore from that last attempt!</i></p><p>“What have we learned about 
armor?”</p><p>Minako blinked back at her. “That running into it isn’t safe?”</p><p>“Yeah, 
and?” Minako gave her a dumb stare as Rei bent down to pick up Hotaru. The small girl 
readily accepted Rei’s presence and almost instantly fell back into a slumber. The woman 
sighed.</p><p>“Lesson number two, child: Hugging a person that isn’t wearing armor, when you 
<i>are</i>, will C-R-U-S-H them. <i>Especially</i> if it’s a small kid.”</p><p>“Feh…” <i>I 
knew that, sorta…</i></p><p>“If you’re done with sitting on your rear end, then let’s get 
going. We can’t stay out here for much longer without experiencing some sort of 
problem.”</p><p>With that resolved Rei and Minako started to re-trace their steps when 
Minako suddenly asked,</p><p>“Can I hold her?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Mm... how ‘bout 
now?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Pleeeease? She’s so adora-!”</p><p>“I said, NO! Shit, now look what 
you did! You woke her up.”</p><p>“...Your fault.”</p><p>“Wha--My fault?! Why you-”</p><p>Rei 
had a funny feeling that it was going to be a looooong walk back.</p>
