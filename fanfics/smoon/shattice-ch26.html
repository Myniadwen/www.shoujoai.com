<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 26 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>The chamber was dark, crackling with a unearthly
energy as the small figure entered, her grey hair
oddly at war with her youthful, almost little girl
like appearance. Human clothing transformed into a
replica of Sailor Fuku, and her stance lost it&#39;s
timidness as she said, &quot;Sailor Iron Mouse is here,
mistress.&quot;

The throne crackled with unholy power as the shadowed
figure who was sitting there gazed at her with utter
contempt. &quot;Why have you failed in acquiring the Star
Seeds, Iron Mouse?&quot; she loudly demanded.

Iron Mouse gulped visibly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry mistress,&quot; she
said respectfully, &quot;but finding the Seeds has been
more difficult than anticipated.&quot;

&quot;We need the Star Seeds, Mouse,&quot; the shadowy figure
hissed, &quot;I need them. You have created five Phages so
far, and not ONE had a true seed?&quot;

&quot;Mistress...&quot; Iron Mouse started.

&quot;Silence!&quot; she roared as she pointed and what looked
like a bolt of lightning leapt out to strike at Iron
Mouse.

&quot;Aaaaah!&quot; Iron Mouse cried out, jerking in pain as the
power lanced through her. &quot;Please, Mistress,&quot; Iron
Mouse whimpered.

With another gesture the attack stopped, Iron Mouse
dropping to the ground in a crumpled heap. &quot;Find me
the Star Seeds,&quot; her voice echoed mysteriously as she
said, &quot;or I may need to turn to more competant help.&quot;

&quot;I will find them,&quot; Iron Mouse softly vowed as the
dark figure seemed to disappear from the chamber. &#145;And
when I do,&#39; she thought as she left the room, her
clothing shifting to human garb, &#145;I&#39;ll use their power
against you, bitch.&#39;

Striding through the halls of the TV station they were
using as both cover and headquarters Iron Mouse headed
to her office, lost in thought. &#145;I need a good Star
Seed candidate,&#39; she mused, &#145;but where can I find
them?&#39; She peered at the celeberty magazines
cluttering her desk, then brightened as she saw a
certain face, &quot;Ah ha!&quot;

Meanwhile, across the city Setsuna hesitated, the
green haired woman feeling unusually timid before
walking inside the store, &quot;Welcome,&quot; the brown haired
older woman smiled, &quot;to Osaka jewelers. How can I help
you?&quot;

Setsuna smiled at the woman&#39;s somewhat exaggerated
manner, &quot;I was looking for a gift, a friendship ring,&quot;
she said with unusual shyness.

Mrs. Osaka lead her over to a display of fine rings as
she asked, &quot;Do you have anything in mind?&quot;

&quot;Something in blue, I think,&quot; Setsuna mused,
considering the color of Ami&#39;s hair.

More women entered the store and Mrs. Osaka excused
herself, &quot;I&#39;ll send someone to help you,&quot; Raising her
voice she called, &quot;Naru!&quot;

A moment later Naru Osaka emerged from the back of the
store, looking much like a youthful version of her
mother. With light brown hair and green eyes the young
lady cut quite a figure, though there was also a
gentle aura of sadness around her.

&#145;Naru, of course,&#39; Setsuna recognized her. When Usagi
Tsukino had been in junior high Naru was her best
friend, a role she was ultimately displaced from by
the Sailor Senshi. On the edges of their dangerous
lives Naru was Occasionally caught in the crossfire,
seeing friends hurt and losing loved ones.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Naru smiled sweetly, &quot;what can I help you with?&quot;

&quot;I think this ring,&quot; Setsuna pointed to the saphire,
&quot;but I&#39;ll need it sized to a smaller hand than mine.&quot;

Handling the ring gently Naru smiled, &quot;We can have it
done in a few days, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Unsure if it was a wise more SEtsuna quietly said,
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for your loss.&quot;

&quot;Ehh?&quot; Naru blinked.

&quot;You are the Naru that Usagi mentioned?&quot; SEtsuna asked
leadingly.

&quot;You knew Usagi?&quot; Naru&#39;s eyes widened a bit. A sad
smile appeared on her cute face, &quot;I didn&#39;t see Usagi
as much after we graduated, but hearing about her
death was a shock.&quot;

&quot;It was for us too,&quot; Setsuna agreed.

Naru nodded, for a moment seeming wise beyond her
years. Something in her eyes told SEtsuna that the
girl had known about Usagi&#39;s identity as Sailor Moon,
and that she grieved for both the loss of the heroine
and a friend. Seeing that grief Setsuna was oddly
humbled, regretting not trying to offer comfort to
those who had been wounded by Usagi&#39;s loss.

&quot;If you&#39;d like,&quot; Setsuna offered to Naru gently, &quot;I
could come by some time and we can talk about her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Naru smiled gently.

&quot;Finished at last,&quot; Naru&#39;s mother swept don on them
eagerly, &quot;now, have you found a design you like?&quot;

&quot;Yes mother,&quot; Naru looked amused by her mother&#39;s
antics as she continued, &quot;but the lady will need it
resized.&quot;

&quot;No problem, a few days work at best,&quot; the older woman
said airily.

Drawing her credit card out of her purse Setsuna
smiled as she said confidently, &quot;I&#39;ll pay up front, of
course.&quot;

&quot;Just the kind of customer I like,&quot; Mrs. Osaka clapped
her hands happily.

&quot;Mother,&quot; Naru rolled her eyes.

&#145;Now,&#39; Setsuna thought, &#145;as long as Haruka and Michiru
keep Ami and the kids occupied, everything should be
fine.&#39;

CRASH!

&quot;I didn&#39;t do it,&quot; Haruka Tenoh quickly protested, the
sandy brown haired woman standing with a tray of
silverware laying on the floor at her feet.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Michiru sighed as she, Hotaru and Chibi-Usa
were setting up the table.

&quot;I&#39;ll help,&quot; Hotaru walked over to where Haruka was
trying to help clean up and mostly failing. The black
haired young girl smiled wryly, &quot;What were you doing,
papa?&quot;

&quot;Trying to look cool while cleaning,&quot; Haruka admitted
wryly, &quot;obviously I need to practice at it a bit
harder.&quot;

&quot;Trying to toss knives into the drying tray isn&#39;t
exactly safe,&quot; Ami Mizuno sounded amused as she
emerged from the study, her glasses gleaming. She had
discarded her school uniform jacket but still cut a
dashing figure in black pants and a white shirt.

&quot;You&#39;d better change before SEtsuna gets back from her
errands,&quot; Michiru noted, &quot;dressed like that Setsuna
might do something rash.&quot;

&quot;Michiru,&quot; Ami blushed.

&#145;Still totally unaware of her effect on people,&#39;
Haruka thought with some amusement. &quot;I&#39;m just glad
that last Phage was less trouble,&quot; she noted as she
and Hoptaru wiped off utensils before putting them
away.

&quot;That actress that attacked Yaten,&quot; Ami agreed.

&quot;And I see a certain someone made a new friend, too,&quot;
Chibi-Usa teased as Luna squirmed uncomfortably.

&quot;I did not,&quot; Luna protested, the little black cat
looking indignant. &quot;Yaten nearly kidnapped me, after
all.&quot; she added.

Yaten Kou, desperate to replace a preforming animal he
needed for a TV appearance stumbled across Luna.
Understandably hesitant Luna still allowed herself to
be wisked off, and actually found herself rather
enjoying the Three Lights company. However, that was
spoiled by a phage attack, the arrival of the
Starlights and her friends.

&quot;Like you couldn&#39;t get away if you wanted to?&quot; Haruka
raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Well,&quot; Luna looked embarassed.

&quot;Leave her alone,&quot; Artemis said, the white cat looking
visibly uncomfortable.

Taking pity on the cat Ami changed the subject,
&quot;Thanks for inviting Chibi-Usa and I over for dinner
tonight. It&#39;s a nice change of pace.&quot;

&quot;We love having you over,&quot; Michiru reassured her.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Hotaru added, &quot;seeing you puts Setsuna in a
good mood.&quot;

Haruka chuckled softly as Ami blushed, &quot;Yeah, Setsuna
always brightens up when she hears you&#39;re coming
over.&quot;

&quot;So, when are you planning on coming over for good?&quot;
Luna jumped in on the teasing.

&quot;Gee,&quot; Ami looked innocent, &quot;can this household afford
to feed six people and two cats?&quot;

Haruka smirked, &quot;It&#39;s the two cats that eat us out of
house and home.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; both Luna and Artemis protested.

&quot;Seriously?&quot; Ami gave a small smile, &quot;It&#39;s a
complicated enough situation with her as my school
nurse, we&#39;re not taking the moving in step until I&#39;m
out of that school.&quot;

A pause then Michiru nodded, &quot;Makes sense.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna suggested that,&quot; Ami admitted, &quot;though I
think I would have also come to that conclusion too,
eventually.&quot;
