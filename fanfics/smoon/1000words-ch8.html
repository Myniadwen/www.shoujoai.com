<a href="../smoon/1000words-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Rei slipped from the bed and Jen&#39;s arms. The sun was just peeking over 
the horizon as she dressed quietly. She grabbed her purse after slipping 
on her heels and made her way from the hotel room.

With a tired sigh, the woman stepped into the elevator, pressing the 
button for the lobby. Leaning against the wall, she closed her eyes and 
allowed herself to relive the day before.

--- Flashback ---

&quot;She looks good.&quot;

Jen turned, smiling at the woman leaning against the wall. Rei returned 
the smile as she walked over. The singer she&#39;d had Jen dress was 
shooting the video for her first single. Regardless of whether or not 
her music was marketable, her look was. It was the perfect mix of 
defiance and compliance to the status quo. In other worlds, another teen 
Pop queen.

&quot;But she doesn&#39;t look as good as you.&quot;

Rei chuckled faintly, arching a brow. She knew there was no one else 
around when Jen wrapped her arms around her waist. The miko licked her 
lips.

&quot;And I didn&#39;t even need you to dress me,&quot; the publicist murmured.

Jen pulled back with a smile, though her insides were twisting. She&#39;d 
just been delivered a warning, Rei Hino style. Behind the jest laid the 
reminder of just who was in control. A reminder that Rei Hino didn&#39;t 
need her for anything, not even to scratch that itch occasionally, 
though she did it well. No, she wasn&#39;t needed. She was just 
entertainment.

&quot;She&#39;s making an appearance next week to promote the video. Think you&#39;re 
up for it?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jen said, keeping her voice even as she turned her 
attention back to the racks of outfits the singer would be changing 
into. &quot;Minako is coming back tonight.&quot;

The stylist hummed a little as she made sure everything was ready. She 
frowned when she realized that Rei hadn&#39;t made a sound in a while. 
Turning, the found the woman&#39;s eyes focused intensely on one of the 
sets, her jaw clenched. There was something disturbing about her face, 
something that made Jen suppress a shiver that threatened to go down her 
spine.

It was something... dangerous. Something primal and untamable. It was 
the look of a wounded animal. An animal stripped of its claws, unable to 
fight back. But being the proud creature that she was, she wouldn&#39;t 
spread her wings to retreat.

No, never that, she&#39;d do anything, anything except turn her back. Rei 
Hino has always been admired and feared, above the rest of the pack. She 
could never show weakness of any kind. Therefore, if faced with 
something threatening, even if she&#39;s already been hurt somehow, she&#39;d 
always fight. Always defend her honor and her pride, however possible. 
If anything, an animal becomes the most dangerous when wounded. It had 
nothing to lose and everything to gain.

How did Jen know all of this? She hadn&#39;t known Rei Hino for that long, 
after all. But she&#39;s known other people like her, tens, hundreds 
perhaps. People so proud that it would kill them to admit defeat. People 
that would rather suffer quietly and pretend nothing&#39;s wrong than to 
show that they&#39;ve been hurt. That they&#39;re scared. That they feel utterly 
helpless and out of control.

But it never worked, pretending and hiding everything away. Everyone had 
a breaking point, but even more than that, people who always pretend to 
be strong were always the weakest ones. And it&#39;s moments like this, Rei 
staring at the set as if she didn&#39;t know whether to hide behind it or 
tear it apart, that always let other people know.

Jen was tempted to go over and wrap her arms around the publicist, to 
sooth her. But to approach her now would make it worse. Rei would just 
retreat and put up even more walls. Ironic, that people like her would 
never back down from a challenge, but would hide every time they had to 
deal with their own feelings. Pitiful, in a way. Heart-wrenching, in 
another.

&quot;Cut! Cut! Cut! That just won&#39;t work!&quot;

Rei snapped out of her thoughts when she heard the annoyed scream of the 
director. She took a deep breath, walking over to the singer&#39;s agent. It 
seemed like it was about time she soothed some ruffled feathers. She 
turned to Jen, giving her a smile and waving before walking away.

Jen watched as the woman left. She&#39;d have to keep an eye on her. 
Something told her whatever was bothering Rei Hino, it&#39;d turn out to be 
a wonderful show to watch.

...............

Rei leaned back in her seat, closing her eyes. She could feel the heat 
coming from Utena&#39;s arm pressed against hers, even through the layers of 
fabric covering them. Utena shifted, making the leather on the seats 
creak. Rei shuddered at the sound, yet another reminder of where they 
were.

&quot;You&#39;ll do wonderfully.&quot;

The younger woman laughed, shaking her head as she opened her eyes and 
looked at her mentor.

&quot;You mean I have to do wonderfully.&quot;

&quot;Why, of course, but that&#39;s not nearly as encouraging as what I said.&quot;

Rei smiled before finally giving up and laughing. Utena chuckled, 
stroking her friend&#39;s hair. She felt the miko lean against her slightly 
and kissed her temple.

&quot;There&#39;s no reason to be nervous, it&#39;s all just business. You&#39;re not 
going out there as Rei Hino, her ex. You&#39;re going as her publicist. Her 
new publicist that&#39;s going to beat Siren into the ground. You better 
start remembering that.&quot;

Rei nodded, the pep talk raising her spirits. Utena was right. She was 
the best in the business, at least right now. Siren had screwed up, so 
now it was her turn. Her turn to revitalize Minako&#39;s reputation and to 
show her old employers what they&#39;d lost by letting her leave so easily. 
She took a deep breath and stepped out of the limo.

................

Utena watched as the representatives from Siren hurried to make 
everything perfect. She smirked when she saw all the members of the 
press they had invited for the event. They were just setting up for 
their own demise. She had a strange urge to cackle like the villains on 
TV usually did, but figured that would draw too much attention.

&quot;They&#39;re making this quite convenient. And I do love how no one&#39;s 
noticed our presence.&quot;

The brunette chuckled as she turned to Rei, who watched the scene with a 
grin the Cheshire cat would&#39;ve been proud of.

&quot;Aren&#39;t they just? When is the plane landing?&quot;

&quot;Any minute now.&quot;

&quot;Not long now until the show starts.&quot;

The cameras started going off as soon as the plane came to a stop. The 
Siren representatives hung back until the plane came to a stop before 
security guards rushed into place, creating a pathway for Minako to the 
limo parked nearby. Rei and Utena looked over at the limo they&#39;d 
brought, effectively hidden from sight by news truck.

Rei swallowed as the door of the plane opened. Two bodyguards walked 
out, checking the area out before waving their client out.

Minako stepped out, sunglasses on to protect her from the flashes of the 
camera. She waved enthusiastically, beaming that brilliant smile of 
hers. She stood at the exit of the plane, turning to let every camera 
take a front body shot of her before walking down the stairs. She posed 
a couple of times quickly, blowing a few kisses at the photographers.

&quot;Well she&#39;s certainly good at that,&quot; Utena commented lightly with 
amusement and weariness.

The miko&#39;s eyes were trained on the blonde as she walked further down 
the pathway. She saw Siren&#39;s people start to move toward the singer. 
With a smirk, she easily stepped out from behind a photographer and 
eased her way through the crowd.

It didn&#39;t take long for the news crews to start letting her through, 
though they didn&#39;t part outright. There was something about her bright 
eyes, her determined look, her face, and the power that radiated from 
her. Whatever that something was, it made them think twice before 
messing with her.

Minako&#39;s eyes followed Rei&#39;s movement from behind her sunglasses. She 
resisted the urge to lick her lips. Two weeks without seeing her ex was 
fourteen days too many. She was like an addiction, see her once and 
you&#39;re hooked.

Now, to see her dressed in that form fitting suit of black that blended 
into the darkness of the night and her hair, eyes accentuated by the 
lavender blouse that made her seem so soft and that confident smile on 
her face...

But all that wouldn&#39;t matter if she wasn&#39;t striding toward her 
purposely, her eyes on the blonde. Minako resisted the urge to shiver at 
the fire in those eyes. It was like she was the miko&#39;s entire world 
again, and gone was the hate that has come to replace the love in her 
eyes.

She focused her attention on the young man approaching her. Blonde hair, 
a charming smile, blue eyes and an expensive suit... Siren was really 
pulling out al the tricks.

&quot;Aino-san, welcome back to Japan. The limo is waiting.&quot;

She gave him a charming smile, feeling the miko get closer to her. She 
flipped her long hair over her shoulder to stall for a brief moment, 
just enough time to let Rei make it the rest of the way.

&quot;Thank you so very much,&quot; she said with a bright smile.

&quot;But Aino-san will be riding with me.&quot;

Minako resisted the urge to smirk at the confident and strong voice. 
Anyone else and the tone would&#39;ve sounded cocky. Well, it did, but with 
Rei it was sexier than anything else.

The man looked utterly confused, looking between Rei and the singer. The 
publicist simply smirked, placing herself between Minako and the blonde 
man. With a flourish, she extended her arm to point her ex in the 
direction of their waiting limo.

&quot;This way, Aino-san.&quot;

Minako couldn&#39;t hide her smile any longer. &quot;Thank you, Hino-san.&quot;

A shiver coursed down Rei&#39;s spine, though she hated it. The way her name 
rolled off Minako&#39;s tongue was like a caress. And it certainly didn&#39;t 
help that she had turned her baby blues on her. Although they were 
hidden behind the dark shades, Rei could imagine the look she was giving 
her...

&quot;Ms. Aino, I don&#39;t understand...&quot;

Rei swiveled, her anger at Minako and her own reaction to the blonde 
bubbling to the surface. She pinned the confused man with her burning 
gaze, her lips forming a cruel smirk.

&quot;Tell your boss that Ms. Aino no longer has any need for their 
services.&quot;

&quot;Her contract-&quot;

&quot;Is null and void. Our lawyers will be contracting you tomorrow 
morning.&quot;

With that, Rei turned and placed her hand lightly on Minako&#39;s elbow. She 
escorted the star to the limo waiting nearby. The security detail she&#39;d 
brought was carving a way for them through the reporters, protecting the 
two of them and Minako&#39;s entourage.

The miko allowed Minako to slip in before stepping in herself, followed 
by Barbara, Mei and Patrick. Utena instructed the driver to go with a 
nod.

&quot;Welcome back to Japan, Ms. Aino.&quot;

Minako smiled at Utena as the woman exchanged pleasantries with the rest 
of her group, chatting about their trip. The blonde&#39;s attention was on 
her ex-girlfriend, who was busy on her Palm Pilot.

&quot;Where&#39;s Jen?&quot; she asked, noticing the presence of her stylist after the 
excitement of what just transpired died down.

&quot;We thought it&#39;d be best if she stayed at the hotel. She didn&#39;t need to 
be caught up in the middle of this.&quot;

Barbara murmured an affirmative at Utena&#39;s words, noticing that Rei 
looked vaguely uncomfortable, though she couldn&#39;t figure out why.

&quot;So, she&#39;s waiting at the hotel?&quot;

&quot;She said she was going to bed and to wake her when you landed.&quot;

Minako looked over at her ex, wondering why she would be privy to such 
information.

&quot;We&#39;ll just see her tomorrow then,&quot; Patrick said as Mei sighed softly.

&quot;Careful, almost seems like you miss her,&quot; Babs teased with a smile.

&quot;Of course I don&#39;t,&quot; Mei huffed indignantly. &quot;I just wanted to wake her 
up.&quot;

The star smiled as her hair stylist giggled, grinning adorably.

&quot;She&#39;d be upset if you didn&#39;t tell her.&quot;

&quot;She won&#39;t be traumatized if we let her sleep a little longer,&quot; Patrick 
added.

Minako studied Rei. There was something that was off about the whole 
thing. It didn&#39;t sit well with her. The publicist was always 
considerate, despite her attempts to hide that fact, but why would she 
want to push something like this? Over the feelings of her employer&#39;s 
stylist?

Maybe she was reading too much into it. Perhaps Rei and Jen became 
friends. Maybe Rei was just being nice. Maybe...

She jaw clenched. No, the two of them couldn&#39;t possibly have... it&#39;s 
only been two weeks. Jen might have showed interest in Rei but her ex 
wouldn&#39;t complicate a job like this...

&quot;Has Jen been moved to the new hotel?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Utena said, answering Babs. &quot;We&#39;ve kept her in the room Siren set 
up, to avoid suspicion.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Babs said with a nod.

They fell into silence, Minako and her crew recovering from the jetlag.

The ringing of Rei&#39;s cell disturbed the stillness. Minako blinked 
sleepily, having been on the edge of falling asleep. The occupants of 
the car turned to the publicist as she withdrew her phone from her 
purse, flipping it open with a flick of the wrist.

&quot;Hino.&quot;

The car was silent as everyone focused on Rei&#39;s phone call, some despite 
themselves. The miko turned her body slightly to face the window. It 
didn&#39;t really give her any more privacy, but she could at least pretend.

&quot;Yes, we picked them up, we&#39;re in the car now.&quot;

They watched as Rei&#39;s brows furrowed. Why couldn&#39;t she just listen? With 
an annoyed look, she handed Minako her mobile.

&quot;It&#39;s Jen.&quot;

Minako felt the sinking feeling in her stomach grow as her instincts 
told her there was something that shouldn&#39;t be going on. She took the 
phone, plastering on one of her bright smiles.

&quot;Hey, you.&quot;

&quot;Mina! How are you guys? It&#39;s great to be in the same city as you 
again.&quot;

The blonde laughed, the sarcasm not masking her friend&#39;s excitement as 
well as she knew Jen wanted.

&quot;Tell her I said &#39;Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!&#39;&quot; Mei added, bouncing a little.

&quot;What she said,&quot; Barbara said dryly as Patrick nodded.

&quot;Everyone-&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, I heard her.&quot;

Minako giggled.

&quot;I-&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Minako imitated as she looked at the rest of her crew. 
&quot;Jen sends her love.&quot;

&quot;Hey! Minako! I do not!&quot;

The singer just smiled.

&quot;So has Rei been treating you well?&quot; She asked casually.

&quot;Very, very well.&quot;

There was no mistaking the alarmed look in Rei&#39;s eyes. And she&#39;d have to 
be an idiot to not understand the purr of Jen&#39;s voice.

She forced the smile to remain on her face as she looked out the window, 
staring at the reflection of the dark look in her own eyes.

&quot;That&#39;s good to hear. I guess I&#39;ll see you tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Definitely. You can tell me all about the trip.&quot;

&quot;Sounds good. Do you want me to give the phone back to Rei?&quot;

&quot;Could you? That&#39;d be great. See you tomorrow.&quot;

Minako said nothing as she handed the phone back to Rei. After a few 
more moments of hushed conversation, the publicist turned off her phone.

Rei watched her former lover, who stayed quiet for the rest of the ride. 
Her heart felt heavy, since the singer had figured out what she and Jen 
have been doing. She just knew somehow.

What annoyed her more was how troubled she was by it. So what if Minako 
knew they were messing around? What business was it of hers? And why did 
she feel so... guilty?

She shook her head. No, she didn&#39;t feel guilty. She didn&#39;t care how 
Minako felt about it. They were over. They were so over that it didn&#39;t 
even need to be said. Or... something like that.

She let out a sigh of relief after she and Utena escorted the star and 
her entourage into the hotel. Babs had insisted that there was no need 
for them to go up as well, promising to call if anything wasn&#39;t to their 
liking.

With a bow and smile she didn&#39;t want to have on her face, she left with 
her boss. It didn&#39;t take her long to hail a cab and head over to Jen&#39;s 
hotel.

--- End Flashback ---

Rei stepped from the elevator as it opened. Her walk was brisk as she 
made her way out of the hotel, giving the doorman a tip when he hailed a 
cab and held the door open for her.

She told the cabby to head for the office. Minako and her gang were 
dropping by at noon. She better start preparing for it now.

...............

&quot;You guys look good.&quot;

Mei placed the tray on the coffee table, offering each person in the 
room a cup of their preferred drink. Babs thanked her with a nod and 
took a sip of her tea, watching as Jen took a seat on the couch, the 
stylist&#39;s eyes taking them in.

&quot;So do you,&quot; Patrick answered with a smile from his seat beside her.

&quot;Thanks, the time off&#39;s been good.&quot;

&quot;What have you been doing?&quot;

&quot;Rei asked me to be the stylist for one of her new artists. So I&#39;ve been 
pretty busy designing a look for her.&quot;

&quot;Oh wow!&quot; Mei said. &quot;She must like you to let you do something like 
that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not about her liking me,&quot; Jen retorted with a hint of annoyance. 
&quot;She likes what I do as a stylist.&quot;

&quot;So are you saying nothing happened?&quot;

Barbara noticed that until now, Minako had been relatively quiet. She 
greeted Jen with her usual cheer and warmth, of course, but was 
strangely silent. She watched with amusement as a faint blush colored 
Jen&#39;s cheeks.

&quot;I knew it!&quot;

Minako&#39;s jaw clenched as Mei and Patrick started ribbing on Jen. The 
stylist didn&#39;t say much at first, but that soon changed. Rei was an 
attractive woman, and a very good catch &#150; one worth boasting about.

Babs watched as Minako got increasingly tense as Jen continued to tell 
them what she and Rei have done. Mina couldn&#39;t be jealous, could she?

She and Jen broke up a long time ago.

&quot;I&#39;m going to take a shower before we head over to Athena.&quot;

Everyone turned to Minako when she interrupted Jen&#39;s narrative about her 
first day with Rei abruptly. The stylist blinked, nodding.

&quot;Yeah... sure.&quot;

Minako walked into the bathroom without another glance at the stylist, 
closing the door just in time to block out the continuing narrative of 
their date.

The blonde stripped quietly, staring at herself in the mirror. She 
closed her eyes, shivering as she could almost feel the ghostly fingers 
of Rei&#39;s touch on her skin again. Her hands, slightly calloused and 
strong from all the work she did at the shrine, but gentle on her body, 
caressing and loving...

Minako opened her eyes, finding herself staring into her own baby blues, 
and not the molten lavender orbs she hoped she&#39;d see. She felt her chest 
constrict, but shook off the feeling.

She didn&#39;t have time for that &#150; for hopes and dreams and regrets. She 
was here for business, not pleasure. It was just getting harder to 
remind herself of that fact.

This took way too long and the chapter itself is way to short, I know. 
I&#39;m really sorry. Real life got in the way... again. I&#39;ll try to get the 
next chapter up as quickly as possible.</pre>
