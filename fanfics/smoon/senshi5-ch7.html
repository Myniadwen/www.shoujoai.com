<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 7 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        The storm had come up in on Tokyo with frightening quickness, 
the great waves crashing up against the gray stones on the shoreline. 
A young woman stood there fearlessly as the waves sprayed her with 
salty mist, her long black hair oddly tinted with green as it flowed 
behind her like a banner, her narrowed eyes almost scarlet as she 
intently studied the waters.

        Her name was Setsuna Meiou, or at least that was what she was 
called herself in this place and time. She had carried many names, 
many identities down through the long span of years, but her duty had 
always been the same. And now, that duty called her to take action 
once again.

        The curved blade she raised in one hand was well balanced, 
held there loosely. A crescent, shining in the dim light almost like 
the moon, a inscription in some dead tongue along the curve of the 
blade itself. Holding it in her left hand she swiftly brought it 
across the palm of her right, dark red blood pooling there in her 
cupped hand.

        The winds died for a moment and she dramatically flung the 
blood out onto the waters. &quot;I call you,&quot; Setsuna declared, &quot;by the 
covenant signed in blood. I call you by the old oaths, sworn in bygone 
days. I call you, by the bonds of heart and duty!&quot;

        The eye of the storm reached her then, the waves oddly calm in 
that space of quiet. Then the liquid began to churn where the blood 
had fallen, frothing and rising up, subsiding then rearing up again. 
Suddenly, the water seemed to split apart, and she rose out of the 
depths.

        Green hair reached her shoulders, her eyes oddly piercing as 
she gazed up at Setsuna. Other than that she was entirely nude, her 
slim form curved gently but not overly so. As soon as she saw Setsuna 
standing there she smiled, a gentle and warm gaze.

        &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Michiru,&quot; Setsuna picked up a robe 
from the ground, shaking it out vigorously before putting it over the 
other woman&#39;s shoulders.

        &quot;Yes, it has,&quot; Michiru pulled the robe shut then followed 
Setsuna from the shore, &quot;so what shall I call you now, oh ancient 
guardian?&quot;

        &quot;Setsuna,&quot; she answered her simply. Quietly Setsuna added,. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for awakening you like this, but I felt I had little 
choice.&quot;

        &quot;The youma?&quot; Michiru asked. At Setsuna&#39;s surprised expression 
she added, &quot;Even resting in the depths I could feel the rising evil.&quot;

        &quot;Worse than that,&quot; Setsuna opened up the car door to the 
clearly bewildered Michiru. &quot;It&#39;s like a horse-less carriage,&quot; she 
offered as an explanation, remembering how long it had been since her 
companion had walked among humanity.

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Michiru got in, carefully avoiding tracking any mud in. 
Once Setsuna got in the driver&#39;s side she asked, &quot;You were saying?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not just the youma,&quot; Setsuna said grimly as she slid her 
key in and started up the engine, &quot;it seems the Oni have awakened.&quot; 
She reached into the back and handed Michiru a simple one piece dress, 
&quot;This will have to do for now.&quot;

        Michiru smiled slightly, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She gasped out softly in 
surprise as the car started to move. A nervous breath, but when 
nothing seemed to go wrong she looked over at Setsuna, &quot;You&#39;re certain 
the Oni have awakened?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m quite certain,&quot; Setsuna said seriously. She concentrated 
on driving, being careful not to meet Michiru&#39;s eyes, &quot;I think we may 
need to awaken the other, as well.&quot;

        Michiru sighed, &quot;You know we don&#39;t get along.&quot;

        &quot;I see little choice,&quot; Setsuna shrugged, &quot;I suspect that we&#39;ll 
need that power when the time finally comes for us to act.&quot;

        &quot;And what of the champions?&quot; Michiru asked.

        &quot;Gathering,&quot; Setsuna shrugged, &quot;but I fear the five may not be 
enough to drive back the coming darkness.&quot; A sigh, &quot;And then there&#39;s 
the problem of the Princess out of Shadow.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Michiru quietly admitted. She smiled ruefully, &quot;Then 
let us go to that place, Setsuna, before I loose my nerve.&quot;

        &quot;All right,&quot; Setsuna answered her crisply, holding back a 
small triumphant smile.

        As they traveled across the great city Michiru gazed out in 
awe, surprise, and even a little bit of horror at what had happened to 
it over the years. The congestion there clearly displeased her, and 
she wrinkled her nose at the smells of pollution. But the great 
skyscrapers silenced any criticism, as did the indoor pools they 
passed.

        &quot;Here?&quot; Michiru blinked as they came to a stop in front of a 
great tower of steel.

        &quot;Tokyo tower,&quot; Setsuna identified it to her companion, &quot;the 
tallest structure in Tokyo.&quot;

        After passing Michiru a pair of shoes, they headed inside. The 
elevator ride up startled Michiru a bit, but they quickly reached the 
observation deck. Walking over to a locked stairway Setsuna touched 
the lock a moment, and with a soft click it opened. They ascended 
together, soon standing near the very top of the metal structure.

        The wind whipped around them as they stepped out onto the 
ledge there, and if they hadn&#39;t been ready they might have fallen &quot;Do 
you think it knows they&#39;re needed?&quot; Michiru called out, holding onto a 
steel beam.

        &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised,&quot; Setsuna answered as she drew the 
ritual knife out again.

        &quot;Good luck,&quot; Michiru murmured softly.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Setsuna threw her a smile.

        Carefully keeping her balance, Setsuna swiftly drew the knife 
across her palm once again, being cautious not to reopen the earlier 
cut. She gave a moment for the blood to pool, while waiting for the 
wind to rise. Feeling the gale force winds begin she flung her hand 
straight up, letting the wind carry the blood up to the clouds.

        The words Setsuna spoke there were much the same as those she 
had said upon the waters &quot;I call on you,&quot; Setsuna cried out, &quot;by the 
covenant signed in my blood. I call you by the old oaths, sworn in 
bygone days. I call you, by the bonds of heart and duty!&quot;

        The winds suddenly died off, an eerie silence stretching 
across the city. A soft rumble, then a louder sound of thunder. 
Setsuna and Michiru exchanged a glance, then each cautiously took a 
step back even as lightning flashed downward!

        Boom!

        There was a bright flash of light and heat as lightning 
touched down for just a moment on the tower, then it was gone. Steam 
swirled, and in the middle of the cloud a figure rose up before 
walking confidently towards where they stood. As the steam began to 
dissipate the figure was completely revealed, and both gazed in shock.

        &quot;A woman?&quot; Michiru gaped in disbelief.

        The sandy haired figure was boyish in appearance, but clearly 
female from the small breasts to the nearly blonde triangle down 
below. Seemingly utterly unconcerned by her nudity the young woman met 
Setsuna&#39;s gaze steadily, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, m&#39;lady. My father, with whom you 
swore your oath, is dead, slain in battle years past.&quot;

        Setsuna paled, then softly said, &quot;Then I&#39;m sorry, to both you 
and to your clan.&quot;

        &quot;My father considered you to be a good friend,&quot; she said to 
Setsuna directly, &quot;as well as an honorable ally against the forces of 
darkness. I would be honored to fight in his place, if you would be 
willing to allow it.&quot;

        Setsuna didn&#39;t hesitate for a moment, &quot;I welcome your aide. 
I&#39;m called Setsuna, in this place and time, and this is Michiru.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m called Haruka,&quot; she turned to meet Michiru&#39;s gaze 
thoughtfully, &quot;and my father spoke of you, too.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;I 
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll repeat it, however.&quot;

        &quot;Wise,&quot; Setsuna smiled slightly. She drew out a pair of pants 
and a shirt from beneath her coat and smiled apologetically, &quot;I was 
expecting...&quot;

        The three retreated indoors, pausing while Haruka changed. 
&quot;Actually,&quot; she admitted as she stood, the pants and shirt 
highlighting her slim form, &quot;I think I like it.&quot; She sat down to slip 
on the runners, &quot;So what&#39;s the situation?&quot;

        &quot;All the forces of darkness are about to be unleashed on a 
nearly defenseless humanity,&quot; Michiru summed it up quickly.

        &quot;Then let&#39;s go stop them,&quot; Haruka said simply.

        Setsuna sighed. &quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple,&quot; she said.

        Michiru smiled wryly, &quot;There are champions of humanity, who 
stand against our ancient enemies. We have to give them the 
opportunity to save their kind, before we take action.&quot;

        &quot;But if they fail,&quot; Setsuna said grimly, &quot;it falls to us.&quot;
