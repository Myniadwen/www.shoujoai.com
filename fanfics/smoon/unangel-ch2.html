<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/unangel-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Deep within dark forests, not yet tainted by humanity, a young woman 
slept. The tree was not quite comfortable, but she had been hunting, and 
soon it would be daybreak&#133;time for her to return home. The wind picked 
up, making her tendrils of her dark hair dance across her face. A smile 
tugged at the corners of her mouth. She had always been sensitive to 
even the slightest of touches, and she kept herself from giggling. She 
was not one to giggle.
 
&quot;Kazuki! Have you found her?&quot;
 
A frustrated groan escaped the beautiful woman&#146;s lips, and a frown 
marred her exotic features. She opened her brilliant jade eyes, and 
gazed down at a tiny, gamine young woman with auburn hair, and bright, 
azure eyes. The young lady looked to be no more than 13, 14 at the most, 
but her demeanor betrayed her supposed innocence.
 
&quot;No, Ririko, I haven&#146;t found her.&quot;
 
Ririko frowned, and Kazuki prepared herself for the verbal abuse that 
was about to occur. For such a small girl, Ririko had quite a large 
mouth.
 
&quot;What do you mean you haven&#146;t found her?! Miss Hotaru will be looking 
for us soon, and you&#146;re lazing about! You know the young mistress 
worries about you.&quot;
 
Kazuki ignored Ririko&#146;s try at a guilt trip, and hopped down from the 
tree, glaring at the diminutive girl. &quot;Miss Hotaru never has any reason 
to worry about me. I am quite capable of taking care of myself. I am not 
Hikari,&quot; she added, watching Ririko&#146;s face contort in rage.
 
&quot;How...how dare you?!&quot; Ririko sputtered, staring up at Kazuki. &quot;Hikari IS 
capable of taking care of herself! Just because she doesn&#146;t mope in the 
shadows like YOU, Kage, doesn&#146;t mean she&#146;s useless! She was just trying 
to escape!&quot; 
 
Kazuki shrugged. &quot;You look for Mitsuki then, Hi.&quot; Ririko muttered a 
curse under her breath. &quot;My name is Ririko.&quot; Kazuki smirked. &quot;And mine 
is Kazuki.&quot;
 
&quot;Kazuki-san! Ririko-chan! Are you two out here?&quot; Kazuki frowned. &quot;Yes, 
Miss Hotaru. Why are you outside, ma&#146;am? You might catch cold.&quot; Kazuki 
watched as Hotaru walked along the natural forest path, and almost 
tripped over a root before standing in front of the two older women and 
putting her hands on her hips. &quot;And you two shouldn&#146;t be out either! 
After what happened to Mitsuki! Oh, the doctor will be furious! Not to 
mention Father!&quot; Kazuki gave Hotaru a soft smile, and then frowned as a 
chill racked the small girl&#146;s frame. &quot;Hmm...let&#146;s get you home. You&#146;re 
going to get sick.&quot; Hotaru pouted, and stomped her foot on the ground. 
&quot;I will not! I&#146;m 16 years old, Kazuki-san! I can take care of myself! 
But YOU two might get in trouble if you&#146;re caught out here!&quot; Kazuki 
shrugged, and in one deft movement, wrapped the black trench coat she 
was wearing around Hotaru. &quot;Come along,&quot; she murmured, grasping Hotaru&#146;s 
hand, and motioning for Ririko to follow them. Ririko grumbled and 
followed the duo, her eyes occasionally darting back and forth. The 
young woman was always alert, for she and Kazuki had a task to protect 
the young Hotaru at any cost. While, chances of the girl being harmed in 
such a secluded place were very low, there was always a small 
possibility.
 
After all, the girl was the doctor of the highly-respected scientist, 
Professor Tomoe.

Wake up, Mitsuki...

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
&quot;Ahh! You scared me kid! What&#146;s wrong?&quot; Minako said, rubbing her eyes 
and staring at the girl.

&quot;I am sorry for waking you, Minako-comforter, but I have remembered 
something.&quot;

&quot;Really, what?&quot;

&quot;My name....is...&quot;

001010010100010101010100101000REMEMBER 
010100101000101000101001001100110101010101010NAME:Mitsuki0001010101010

&quot;Mitsuki.&quot;
 
Minako smiled brightly. &quot;Cool name, kid.&quot;  Mitsuki simply nodded. &quot;I 
suppose.&quot; Minako tore her gaze away from Mitsuki, not liking the dull, 
empty look in the young woman&#146;s eyes. &quot;Yeah...err, well, I have to get 
ready for work. My boss...well, he&#146;s a real jerk sometimes, and he doesn&#146;t 
like when I&#146;m late.&quot; In reality, Minako&#146;s boss, a famous director who 
went by the name of Kunzite Farrow, was a very even-mannered young man. 
He simply was very strict when it came to his staff. But that went over 
Minako&#146;s head, like most things. He was her boss, she didn&#146;t like him, 
and that was that.

Mitsuki tilted her head to one side. &quot;Work...then, where will I go?&quot; 
Minako sighed.
 
&quot;Oh man...&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
&quot;Where is Minako?&quot; Kunzite asked, raking his fingers through his hair, 
turning to gaze at another one of his assistants. &quot;I don&#146;t know Mr. 
Farrow, sir...she said she&#146;d be here...&quot; Kunzite growled, and tapped his 
long slender fingers on his thighs. &quot;Bubble head, isn&#146;t she...she better 
hurry up,&quot; he added, clenching his teeth, &quot;she&#146;s almost as bad as that 
Tsukino girl...she&#146;s lucky she&#146;s a good actress...by the way, where is 
Tsukino?&quot; The assistant hung his head. &quot;With her boyfriend sir.&quot; Kunzite 
turned to glare at the young man.
 
&quot;WHAT?! We need her today! What is she doing, traipsing along with that 
stupid model boy toy of hers?!&quot; The assistant rolled his eyes, brushing 
a strand of blonde hair from his face. &quot;Sir, Mamoru Chiba isn&#146;t JUST a 
model. He graduated from Harvard, you know.&quot; Kunzite yawned. &quot;Just 
because you have a crush on that stupid boy, Zoicite, doesn&#146;t mean I&#146;m 
supposed to like him.&quot; Zoicite pouted. &quot;Tsukino sure is lucky...ahh...and 
here comes Miss Aino...why, look what she&#146;s dragging with her.&quot; Kunzite 
raised an eyebrow. &quot;Who&#146;s that girl with her?&quot; Minako ran over to 
Kunzite at almost breakneck speed, tugging Mitsuki along with here. &quot;So, 
so sorry, Mr. Farrow, sir...but my...friend, Mitsuki,&quot; she motioned to the 
girl, &quot;just popped up last night...she just got into town...and well, um...I 
had to bring her with me, and err...we were up all night reminiscing on 
old times, you know how that is,&quot; she giggled nervously, &quot;and so I&#146;m 
running a little late...so, so sorry...&quot; Zoicite and Kunzite both blinked at 
once. &quot;Ok ...well...good thing you&#146;re here, Aino,&quot; Kunzite said gruffly,&quot; 
because Tsukino is gone, and you have to fill in her part.&quot;
 
Minako&#146;s eyes widened.
 
&quot;ME? Fill in for Usagi? I mean...but...whoa...&quot;
 
Zoicite gently nudged Minako with his shoulder. &quot;Don&#146;t ask questions, 
hon.&quot;
 
Kunzite frowned. &quot;Yes, you. You know the lines; I know you do, because 
I&#146;ve seen you drilling them into that empty head of Tsukino&#146;s. And, 
another thing...&quot;
 
Minako gulped. &quot;Yes?&quot;
 
&quot;Is your friend a model? She&#146;s quite pretty.&quot; Minako turned to Mitsuki, 
who looked about as confused as she did. &quot;Um...I&#146;m not sure...we haven&#146;t 
talked in months...are you, Mitsuki,&quot; she asked, trying to get some sort 
of response from the girl. She was pretty, maybe she had been an actor, 
or model of some sort.
 
Mitsuki only gave her a blank stare, and shook her head slowly. &quot;No...but, 
I could try, if you wanted me to.&quot; 
 
Kunzite gave her an incredulous look, and Zoicite laughed.  &quot;Well, at 
least she&#146;s willing to work. That&#146;s more than I can say for most 
actresses and models nowadays.&quot; Kunzite smiled. &quot;Then she&#146;s hired.&quot;
 
Minako blinked. &quot;Huh?&quot;
 
Zoicite leaned in toward Minako and whispered, &quot;Mr. Farrow knows that 
fashion designer, you know, Setsuna Meiou? Well, lately she&#146;s been 
looking for someone to model her spring designs, and your friend is 
obviously it.&quot; Minako blinked. &quot;But...she doesn&#146;t have any experience...&quot; 
Kunzite laughed. &quot;Doesn&#146;t matter. Setsuna says she&#146;s dead tired of 
dealing with stuck-up little snobs, and I believe your friend...Mitsuki 
is it? Well, I believe she&#146;ll be a fresh breath of air for dear Setsuna. 
The poor woman has been run ragged. As for you, Aino...Zoicite, hand her 
over to the makeup crew. We need to start shooting.&quot; Zoicite gently 
nudged Minako away, and Minako frowned. 
 
&quot;Hey!&quot;
 
Kunzite smiled. &quot;Don&#146;t worry Aino, I&#146;ll take care of the girl, you just 
get ready for filming.&quot; Minako sighed and let herself get taken away. 
 
Kunzite turned to Mitsuki and chuckled. &quot;Now you, young lady...I&#146;ll have 
to call up Setsuna right away.&quot; Mitsuki just nodded her head, staring in 
the direction Minako had gone.
 
&quot;Yes sir...&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Usagi Tsukino snuggled up against her boyfriend of two years, Mamoru 
Chiba. &quot;Mamo-chan, do you think what I did was good for Minako? I know 
she wanted the part so badly, and I couldn&#146;t think of anything better....&quot; 
Mamoru kissed Usagi&#146;s cheek. &quot;Ahh, Usako, you were a saint today. Minako 
can finally get her big break. Besides,&quot; he added, giving the 
odango-haired young woman a cheeky grin, &quot;she&#146;s the better actress.&quot; 
Usagi punched him in the arm.
 
&quot;You jerk!&quot;
 
&quot;Ahh, I was just joking, Usako...&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
&quot;So, Hikari has not been found.&quot;

&quot;No, Mr. Tomoe, sir...we even sent the trackers...no trace of her.&quot;

&quot;Ahh, I see...and I am wary of sending Kage and the others out...they might 
leave too.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, miss Hotaru has grown quite attached to Kage...I think she would be 
very displeased, personally.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, I&#146;m...worried about that too. I don&#146;t want her to get TOO attached, 
you see. Forming a bond with Kage is quite alright, but...&quot;
 
&quot;I understand sir. Perhaps we should separate them. I doubt Kage would 
mind.&quot;
 
&quot;Ahh, my dear Enkai, that is where you are wrong. I&#146;ve made all of you 
different you see, personality traits, everything. You can FEEL. That 
was my goal.&quot;
 
&quot;I...see...sir. Would you like a song?&quot;
 
&quot;That is alright, En...Nami...I wish to rest now.&quot;
 
&quot;...Alright Sir.&quot;
