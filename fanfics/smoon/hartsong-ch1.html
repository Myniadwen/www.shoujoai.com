<h1>Heart Song</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hotaru Tomoe took a drink from her glass, her hat
pulled down a bit to try and hide her violet eyes. She
didn&#39;t want to be seen mooning over the singer
currently performing up on stage, despite her having
visited here nearly every night for the past few days.

&quot;Your refill, miss,&quot; the bartender said, his black
hair falling into his eyes.

&quot;I didn&#39;t order this, mister...,&quot; Hotaru blinked, the
business suit clad woman sitting up unconsciously.

&quot;Mamoru,&quot; he introduced himself. He nodded towards
where the singer continued to serenade the audience,
&quot;Miss Aino asked me to, if you showed up again.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Hotaru asked.

&quot;Minako doesn&#39;t buy drink for people very often,&quot;
Mamoru added, turning back to cleaning out some of the
glasses.

Hotaru turned back to the stage, looking at Minako
singing so beautifully. She raised the glass in a
toast to Minako and felt warm as Minako flashed her a
smile. The woman in the slinky red gown finished up
her tune then slid the microphone into it&#39;s metal
stand, her blue eyes twinkling merrily. &quot;I hope you&#39;ll
be back later on tonight for the second half,&quot; Minako
said with a purr, &quot;but for now, I have a very
important date.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s seeing someone, figures,&#39; Hotaru thought glumly
as she saw Minako disappear off stage and a DJ start
up some background music. She tried not to feel
disappointed, reminding herself she didn&#39;t really know
anything about this woman.

Wandering by a few days ago Hotaru had heard the voice
of an angel coming from the nightclub and wandered
inside, quickly becoming enraptured by the blonde
beauty standing on stage. Even more stunning was her
cheerful banter and stage presence, a warm way about
her that drew Hotaru in almost instantly.

&quot;Is this seat taken?&quot; the voice asked sweetly, pulling
Hotaru back from her happy memories to a disappointing
present.

&quot;No, that&#39;s fine,&quot; Hotaru started to say as she turned
on her stool to look at her, only to trail off in
stunned surprise.

Minako Aino looked as beautiful up close as she did on
stage, her friendly smile lighting up her face. She
took the seat gracefully, eyes faintly amused as she
offered her hand, &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been
introduced. I&#39;m Minako Aino, and you are...?&quot;

Hotaru took the hand, debating the impulse, then
kissed the back of her had. &quot;Hotaru Tomoe, ma&#39;am,&quot; she
answered, looking up to meet her eyes.

A blush colored Minako&#39;s cheeks but she seemed charmed
by the old fashioned gesture. &quot;Very nice to meet you,
Ms. Tomoe,&quot; Minako gave a flirtatious smile.

&quot;Hotaru, please,&quot; she urged with a half smile.

&quot;It&#39;s a nice name,&quot; Minako nodded as she leaned a
little closer to Hotaru, &quot;and you can call me Minako,
if you like.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d be honored,&quot; Hotaru said honestly. She gave
Minako a searching glance, &quot;I thought you said you had
a date...?&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; Minako agreed as she gazed into Hotaru&#39;s eyes
meaningfully, &quot;why do you think I&#39;m here?&quot; She smiled
as Hotaru blushed, realizing what Minako meant. &quot;I&#39;d
ask if you come here often, but I&#39;ve seen you in the
audience the last four nights.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t think I was being that noticeable,&quot; Hotaru
sighed as she took her hat off, setting it on the bar.
Freed of it&#39;s confines her short black hair flowed
free, shimmering a little like a raven&#39;s wing in the
bar lights. She waved down Mamoru and said, &quot;A drink
for the lady, please.&quot;

&quot;Your regular?&quot; Mamoru asked Minako curiously.

&quot;Please,&quot; Minako flashed him a grin then looked at
Hotaru thoughtfully. &quot;I think I felt your eyes on me
the first night, then I began to look for you.&quot; With a
wry smile she then asked, &quot;So an I being stalked,
or...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m no stalker,&quot; Hotaru said quickly in her own
defense, &quot;I just... well, I guess I just was drawn in
here by your singing.&quot; The younger woman blushed as
she admitted, &quot;I&#39;ve never heard anything so
beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Minako purred. She looked at Hotaru
curiously, &quot;You know what I do, of course, but what
about you?&quot;

&quot;Nothing as exciting as being a lounge singer,&quot; Hotaru
drew a card from her pocket and passed it over, &quot;I&#39;m
just a antique dealer here in town.&quot; She sipped her
drink and asked, &quot;So how did you become a singer?&quot;

Minako gave a impish smile, &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to be
famous, ever since I was a little girl. I haven&#39;t made
it yet, but I&#39;m working on it.&quot;

&quot;Having seen you perform,&quot; Hotaru said with simple
honesty, &quot;I don&#39;t doubt it.&quot;

Minako reached out to gently trail a finger over
Hotaru&#39;s cheek, &quot;You&#39;re quite the charmer.&quot; She
smiled, pleased to see Hotaru blushed faintly, then
looked at her watch with a sigh. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she got
up, &quot;the second set starts soon.&quot;

&quot;I wish we could keep talking,&quot; Hotaru said softly,
meeting Minako&#39;s eyes.

&quot;My night&#39;s over after this,&quot; Minako said after a
moment, &quot;if you stick around, I wouldn&#39;t mind having
some company this evening.&quot;

Hotaru nodded firmly, &quot;I&#39;d be honored.&quot;

Minako fought back a smile as she headed for the
dressing room, swiftly pulling off her earrings first
as she shut the door behind her. Her sedate heels were
kicked off and the dress was pulled up and over her
head, then she set it aside carefully to be washed out
later. Her red satin dress gleamed on it&#39;s hanger, a
sinful looking sheath that showed every curve and she
had to wiggle her body a bit just to get into it.

&#39;I can&#39;t believe I invited her out,&#39; Minako thought as
she picked up a brush and touched up her makeup in the
well lit mirror, &#39;I barely even know her.&#39; Still,
something in the girl&#39;s soulful violet eyes seemed to
draw her to Hotaru, and if her years of performing had
taught her anything at all it was to go with her
instincts. She pursed her lips, taking her blood red
lipstick and gliding it on, smiling a little as she
grabbed a pair of fresh earrings too. Sliding on spike
heels she was ready to perform the second set, her
favorite torch songs.

After the show was over and the club was running down
Hotaru was standing outside, her jacket slung over her
shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; Minako said from behind her.

Hotaru turned, then blinked in surprise at the
transformed young woman. Gone was the stylish gown,
replaced with casual but fine clothes, a short skirt
and blouse in blue and white. Her blonde hair
shimmered beautifully but a different, subdued style
of makeup gave her a different aura. &quot;Wow,&quot; Hotaru
breathed as Minako reached her side.

&quot;Surprised?&#39; Minako asked.

&quot;You look wonderful,&quot; Hotaru said honestly, &quot;but why
so different than on stage?&quot;

&quot;I get approached by fans too often, otherwise,&quot;
Minako took Hotaru&#39;s arm, stroking the white cotton of
her shirt clad arm. &quot;You look yummy, too, by the way,&quot;
she said softly.

Hotaru blushed, but her smile was pleased. &quot;Have you
had any dinner?&quot; she asked, looking up at the slightly
taller woman.

&quot;I didn&#39;t,&quot; Minako admitted, &quot;or lunch, either.&quot; At
Hotaru&#39;s worried look she smiled, &quot;Not intentionally,
but I got busy.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s get you fed,&quot; Hotaru said firmly.

They walked together for a few moments, then Minako
smiled softly, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

Hotaru smiled wryly, &quot;I guess I was trying to think of
a way to tell you that my intentions towards you are
honorable.&quot;

&quot;My intentions aren&#39;t honorable at all,&quot; Minako purred
and Hotaru blushed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she softened her
tone, &quot;I kind of find that sweet, really.&quot; She looked
at Hotaru, &quot;Did I startle you?&quot;

Hotaru was still blushing. &quot;A little,&quot; she admitted,
&quot;are you always this impulsive?&quot;

&quot;I am when I find something I want,&quot; Minako squeezed
Hotaru&#39;s arm.

Hotaru looked up at her shyly but she was smiling.
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I would have
imagined this happening when I walked in the club a
few days ago.&quot;

Taking the hint of how short of a time they knew each
other Minako smiled. &quot;Let&#39;s start with dinner then,&quot;
she said, &quot;and see where things go from there.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Hotaru agreed.

End

Notes: Minako as a nightclub singer was an easy fit,
and making Hotaru a antique dealer was almost as
simple. I wanted to write a love at first sight story
with a touch of realism, though the ending almost had
to be a bit undefined.</pre>
