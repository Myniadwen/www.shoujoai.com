<p>Time seemed to stand still briefly, as  if everyone and everything else in the universe disappeared. There was  no Earth, no Tokyo, no mission, no apocalyptic Silence or Talismans or  schools or daemons. There was just them, here and now, and there was  the warmth shared between them as each gave vent to their longing  through their shared kiss.</p>
<p>They finally pulled away from each  other, both flushed. Michiru, who’d been unconsciously holding her  breath during the kiss, suddenly remembered to breathe. She trembled a  bit as she looked around self-consciously, hoping no one else at the  Crown saw them. They were near the back, true, but it still made her  nervous. As she continued to scan the other young faces, she heard  Haruka chuckling. &quot;What's so funny?&quot; she asked as she raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&quot;You,&quot;  Haruka said teasingly. &quot;Look, most people's first impression of me is  that I'm a handsome young boy. Even if someone did see us kiss just  now, chances are they wouldn't be able to put two and two together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe  so,&quot; Michiru answered, her cheeks still flushed, &quot;But from now on, if  we're going to do that, let's wait until we're alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka  smiled, &quot;Fair enough.&quot; She moved a little bit away from Michiru, but  kept the artist's hand in hers. &quot;In that case, maybe we should get back  to business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Michiru nodded, &quot;We should...&quot; her voice died off suddenly, and she closed her eyes and grimaced.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan?&quot; Haruka asked out of concern, &quot;What is it? Is it your back?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't you feel it?&quot; she asked, &quot;Can't you feel the storm swelling.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka  tried to focus, but shook her head. &quot;I can sense... something. It feels  a bit like rushing wind, but I think it's more tied in to your feelings  and anxiety than the original source, if that makes any sense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It  does, actually,&quot; Michiru responded thoughtfully. &quot;You're not as  intuitive as I am, or as psychic.&quot; Leaning closer, she squeezed the  racer's hand. &quot;Something's very wrong, Haruka. We have to leave here.  Do you have your henshin wand?&quot;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Motoki  returned to their table to see if they were enjoying their meal.  Instead he found both girls gone, the food untouched, and a thousand  yen tip (roughly U.S. ten dollars). &quot;Weird,&quot; he quipped as he pocketed  the tip and went about his business.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>&quot;You  shouldn't even be out here in your condition,&quot; Haruka admonished as  they hurried down the sidewalk, &quot;You're injured, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  stopped, her body stiffening a bit as she turned to face the blonde.  &quot;We have a mission,&quot; she said, looking deep into Haruka’s teal green  eyes as she continued, “I know we just experienced something very… <em>intimate</em> back at the Crown, but I need you to promise me that for the time being  you’ll forget about my safety and focus on our mission.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“The  Silence is coming, Haruka,” she said forcefully, “It’s coming, and only  we can stop it. I need you to promise me you’ll focus on that, please?”</p>
<p>Haruka stared back at her a second or two before finally nodding. “Alright, I promise.”</p>
<p>Michiru  stood still a few seconds longer gazing into Haruka's eyes before  turning around and once more heading off in the direction where the  waves were calling her. She soon spotted a young boy carrying a red  balloon with a black five pointed star on it, the waves crashing in her  head almost painfully as she motioned the child over. &quot;That's a neat  balloon,&quot; she said, bending down to get a better view, &quot;Where did you  get it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lady clown on the street corner giving away free balloons,&quot; the child answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru,&quot; Haruka asked somewhat confused, &quot;What's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Street corner?&quot; Michiru asked excitedly as she ignored her fellow Senshi’s question, &quot;How far away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About two blocks back that way,&quot; he said as he pointed.</p>
<p>&quot;Here,&quot;  Michiru said as she pulled out her purse and frantically searched it,  &quot;Here's enough yen to buy yourself ten balloons if you'll give me  your's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ten?&quot; the boy asked in disbelief. &quot;I'll take it! Wow!”  he exclaimed as he ran past them down the street. Once he was out of  sight, Michiru quickly pulled a safety pin out of her purse and popped  the balloon.</p>
<p>Haruka was at a loss. &quot;What on earth did you do that for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  the Death Buster's insignia,&quot; she said, pointing to what was left of  the black star. “It…” her voice died out at the star on the popped  balloon started to glow. “Duck!” she shouted as she threw it towards a  nearby garbage can and dived towards the ground, with Haruka following  suit. Almost immediately after falling in the garbage can a bright  light emanated from the can for several seconds before it finally let  up.</p>
<p>Haruka looked over and noted the pain on Michiru’s pain. The  action had put strain on her injured back and arm. She got up and held  out her hand, “Michiru-chan…”</p>
<p>&quot;Come on,” the artist said, taking  the offered hand and allowing Haruka to help her up, “We have to  destroy the rest of the balloons and stop that clown!&quot;</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>The  street had come to a complete dead stop. Men, women and children of all  ages lay motionless on the sidewalk as a group of balloons slowly rose  up into the sky, their owners no longer holding onto them.</p>
<p>Zultan  realized she had a short period of time in which to operate. Even now,  shop owners and passing motorists were staring at the prone bodies,  wondering at the strange heart crystals they saw floating above each of  the victims. Zultan pulled a large blue sack out of her clown costume,  intent on reaping the harvest of crystals for her master.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Haruka rounded the corner first, keeping out of sight of the witch as Michiru caught up.</p>
<p>“Haruka-chan…” Michiru called.</p>
<p>“Kun.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Call me kun.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Haruka-kun, do you know how to use your henshin wand?”</p>
<p>“Hai. Actually, someone who already seemed to know of the henshin wand’s existence explained it to me.”</p>
<p>“Nani?” Michiru asked in surprise. “Someone else knew of it?”</p>
<p>“Hai, a tall woman with long emerald green hair who called herself Setsuna.”</p>
<p>“Setsuna,”  Michiru muttered as she put two and two together, “Yes, I see… Come  on,” she said as she held her wand aloft, “Let’s transform and stop  that clown!”</p>
<p>Michiru transformed first. Haruka once more watched  the process in amazement as the beautiful young artist transformed  again into her Senshi form. She then took her own wand and held it  aloft, “Uranus planet power, make-up!”</p>
<p>In Michiru’s case, a water  spout had formed around her. Haruka, however, found herself in the eye  of a whirlwind, her own clothes dissolving as she felt new ones weave  around her lithe frame. Her body tingled all over, as if a small  current was running through her hitting every nerve at once. A tiara  formed on her forehead and the whirlwind finally died.</p>
<p>Sailor  Uranus looked down at herself in her Senshi form for the first time,  and frowned. “A skirt,” she groaned, “Why’d it have to be a skirt?”</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Zultan  began to approach one of the fallen civilians, an elderly woman still  clutching her granddaughter's hand. She smiled maniacally as she  reached out for the woman’s heart crystal.</p>
<p>“Not so fast!”</p>
<p>The  witch sneered; the fool had shown up after all. If the bones were  telling the truth, Sailor Neptune was severely injured in her last  encounter. This would hardly be much of a fight. She began to cackle as  she turned to face the girl, intent on making the brat’s death a slow  and painful one.</p>
<p>Her cackling stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>Sailor Neptune was not alone.</p>
<p>“Guided by a new eon, Sailor Uranus acts with elegance.”</p>
<p>“Likewise, guided by a new eon, Sailor Neptune acts with grace.”</p>
<p>Zultan’s  jaw momentarily hung open as she stared at the newcomer in shock. “No,”  she finally managed to utter, “No, no, no, no, no!” As the two Senshi  crouched down ready to fight, the witch quickly ran towards the crate  she’d been standing on a few minutes before and pulled it up, revealing  the Professor’s box.</p>
<p>Sailor Uranus looked over to her right and  saw her fellow Senshi tense a bit. Something was coming, something bad.  She couldn’t sense things psychically like her fellow Senshi could, but  she somehow had an empathic link with Sailor Neptune herself. She could  sense her moods and her emotional states. And right now, as she looked  at the exposed bandaging on the Senshi’s arm, she was sensing fear.</p>
<p>A  button was pushed, and as the heart crystals returned harmlessly to  their owners, smoke started to pour out of the box. “Damn it,” Zultan  hissed as she turned and ran in the opposite direction, tossing away  her wig as she pushed through the crowd of curious spectators watching  the event, “Now there’s <em>two </em>of them!”</p>
<p>Sailor Neptune  watched the smoke clear to reveal a metallic woman in a red bathing  suit with a white cross on the center of it emerge. It smiled at her  and Sailor Uranus, revealing a mouth filled with glistening knife  points instead of teeth.</p>
<p>“Swissu,” she said as a large knife  blade swung out from her wrist to replace her right hand. The other  hand was likewise replaced, this time with something that resembled a  giant screw-type bottle opener.</p>
<p>Sailor Uranus and Neptune looked at one another briefly, nodded, and then charged at the daemon.</p>
<p>What  followed, from Sailor Neptune’s perspective at least, was something  unique. She wasn't fighting alone this time, but in concert with  another. The battle didn’t have the same feel as the other fights she’d  fought. This wasn’t a brawl, it was a <em>duet</em>. Somehow, the two  seemed to move in perfect concert with one another as if they’d fought  side by side thousands of times before. It was as if something had been  missing in all her previous battles, and now she knew what it was.</p>
<p>On  her end, Sailor Uranus had never fought as a Senshi before, but she did  have two things going for her. First, she was a trained martial artist  with a black belt in judo. Second, there was the empathic link she felt  between herself and Neptune. While she had no idea that it was a part  of her awakening, she did realize that it allowed for a certain  non-verbal communication between herself and her fellow Senshi,  allowing the two to move as one.</p>
<p>The daemon, seeing them coming,  ran towards them swinging her blade. Michiru leapt in the air as Haruka  rushed forward to meet the attack. As Neptune landed behind the daemon,  Haruka grabbed the daemon's knife and twisted, using the youma's own  momentum to flip it over onto its back.</p>
<p>“Deep Submerge!”</p>
<p>The  daemon had no hope of avoiding the attack, a blood-curdling scream  issuing forth from it as it was hit. Sailor Uranus then stepped  forward, the blonde seemingly moving on instinct as she raised her hand  up into the air. Bright yellow streaks of kinetic energy streamed down  from the sky into her upraised hand, which she then directed down  towards the ground as she yelled out the phrase Setsuna had taught her,  “World Shaking!”</p>
<p>The energy hit the ground like a missile,  blasting cement everywhere as it sped forward. It grew and formed  itself into a large yellow sphere, complete with a ring surrounding it.  It finally left the pavement and rose into the air, shining brightly  and terribly before both Senshi’s eyes just before it hit the daemon.  With a final agonizing cry the creature disappeared, transforming back  into a Swiss army knife. A pod then emerged from the knife and crumbled  to dust.</p>
<p>Sailor Uranus looked in awe at the devastation she’d just caused. “Holy…”</p>
<p>“Come  on,” Sailor Neptune said, “There’s no time to lose, we have to get out  of here.” She leapt into the air and away from the onlookers with  Sailor Uranus following close behind.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>“How  does it look?” Michiru asked later at Haruka’s dorm room as the blonde  peeled back some of the bandages to have a peek at her injuries.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to believe this,” the racer said, “But your scars are almost completely healed.”</p>
<p>“Interesting,” Michiru said thoughtfully, “I wonder if the act of transforming into Neptune had something to do with it…”</p>
<p>…<em>And  in other news, downtown officials are still baffled by the events of  earlier today. It seems somebody put on some sort of performance  without asking for permission first, and at least eighteen thousand yen  worth of property damage took place. So far none of the TV or movie  studios are coming forward to admit responsibility for the debacle, but…</em></p>
<p>Haruka  turned off the small radio on her bed stand and began to reapply the  bandages to Michiru’s back. “We should be getting you back to Saint  Agatha’s soon.”</p>
<p>Michiru nodded, then noticed something as she  looked closer around the other girl’s room. “Haruka-kun, why do you  have all these bags of luggage lying around in here?”</p>
<p>Haruka  stopped what she was doing. “I’m… Transferring.” Noting the look of  surprise on Michiru’s face, she continued, “I’m transferring to Mugan  Academy. I applied long before we met.”</p>
<p>Michiru was silent for a  bit as she contemplated the answer. “Right,” she finally sighed, “Then  I guess there’s nothing else for me to do than to transfer as well.”</p>
<p>Haruka shook her head, “They only take top students…”</p>
<p>“Then I shouldn’t have any trouble getting in.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t have any idea of what the tuition is.”</p>
<p>Michiru smiled. “Thanks to my parents money that shouldn’t really be too much of a problem.”</p>
<p>“The new school year starts shortly, you’ll be coming in partway into the semester. You…”</p>
<p>“My  mind’s made up,” she said, coming over and putting a hand up to  Haruka’s cheek. “After all this time, I’ve finally found you. And now  that I have you, where you go I’ll follow.”</p>
<p>Haruka didn’t know what to say to that. She came closer, putting her own hand over Michiru’s as they kissed.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>“Two  of them,” Zultan growled as she inhaled from her cigarette, sweat  beading on her forehead. “Damn it, there’s two of them now!” She  grimaced in pain as she held the bandaging closer, the wound still raw  and painful. She could already imagine what would happen. Kaolinite had  been telling the professor all along that using the Witches Six was a  waste of time, and that she should’ve been given the assignment  instead. Now she would press the issue once again.</p>
<p>Eudial  meanwhile had been trying to undermine her authority in the Witches Six  for months now. It was an obvious power play; if Zultan were  discredited, Eudial would then become leader of the group. She hated  the smug little bitch, especially after the incident with the snails in  her locker that she just knew Eudial had to be behind.</p>
<p>Then there was the Professor. Of all of them, he was the only one Zultan could say she truly feared.</p>
<p>She  tossed the cigarette butt into the overflowing ashtray. If she wanted  to remain in her position of authority both within the Witches Six and  the Death Busters, she had to start producing results quick.</p>
<p>She  reached for her botttle of sake, hoping to get drunk. She reasoned that  if she were inebriated the pain wouldn't hurt as much. She was about to  re-examin the wound when the phone rang. &quot;Witches Six,&quot; she grunted out.</p>
<p>&quot;Zultan, you've failed me again, haven't you?&quot;</p>
<p>Zultan grimaced, &quot;Hai, professor-sama, I've failed you. But I've failed you for the last time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He, he, I seem to have heard that one before, Zultan.&quot;</p>
<p>Zultan took a drink of sake straight from the bottle. &quot;Professor-sama, did you get my package?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai, I did. I hardly think trying to mend things with gifts will help though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you haven't opened it yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Open it now,&quot; she said as she took another drink. On the other end of the line she heard rustling, followed by a gasp.</p>
<p>&quot;Zultan!&quot; Professor Tomoe said, &quot;This... This is a finger!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A pinky, actually,&quot; Zultan groaned out as she looked down at the bloody bandages on her left hand, &quot;My pinky, to be precise.&quot;</p>
<p>There  was silence on the other end, followed by loud laughter. &quot;I see,&quot; the  Professor chuckled, &quot;The yakuza act of reperation for a botched job,  eh? Even for you that seems a bit overly dramatic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's more than reperation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  a pledge,&quot; Zultan said maliciously, &quot;The next time those Sailor Senshi  and I meet, only one of us will come out of it alive.&quot;</p>
