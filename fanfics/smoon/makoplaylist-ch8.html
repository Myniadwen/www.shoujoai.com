<h1>Makoto's Playlist (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chakeroo.html">chakeroo</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makoplaylist-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><p class="p1">“Minachan! Dinner is ready!” Mrs. Aino shouted from the kitchen as she 
prepared dinner. Mr. Aino sat at the table and looked at the food her wife prepared.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minachan didn’t hear her mom. She still had Makoto’s iPod and was listening 
to it and browsing their pictures for the n<sup>th</sup> time in her room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>It’s been almost a month since I came here. I want to go home, I miss 
Makochan a lot and Jupiter. Damn that excess baggage fee, I had to leave Jupiter to Rei. I 
miss them so much.</i> Minako then put a pillow on her face and screamed. The pillow didn’t 
help much to muffle the sound of her scream and her parents ran as fast as they could to 
her room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">”Baby, are you okay?” her dad said as she pulled the pillow away from 
Minako’s face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako was startled because she didn’t hear her parents come in. She 
accidentally dropped the iPod on her bed. Mrs. Aino saw a picture of Makoto hugging Minako 
at the screen of the gadget. Mr. Aino also saw this and got the ipod from the bed and he 
sighed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is all of this gloominess you’ve been projecting since you came here, all 
about Makochan?” her dad asked. Mrs. Aino smiled.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako couldn’t answer her parents. She was afraid of what their reactions 
would be if she confessed everything now but she knew she had to fight for Makoto no matter 
what.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You can talk to us dear. You know that.” Mrs. Aino reassured her daughter as 
she sat by her side.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s Makochan’s ipod. I kind of borrowed it from her.” Minako was blushing 
as she sat up. Her parents knew that it was time to talk about this matter with their 
daughter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So you finally figured things out huh?” Mr. Aino smiled at Minako. Their 
daughter just nodded and blushed. He hugged Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m sorry mom, dad. I can’t stay here. It’s not that I don’t love you guys, 
I do. I really do. I just need to go home. I miss Makochan so much. I’m sorry I didn’t turn 
out to be… normal. If you want to disown me or anything, I’ll take it. I love Makochan.” 
Minako started to cry.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her parents lovingly looked at her, they then took Minako’s hand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Look Minako, we don’t want to force you to stay here. We wanted you to go 
here because we wanted you to have some options. And to let you think about what is 
important and dear to you.” Mr. Aino was now brushing the blonde’s hair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You’re all grown up now and we know that. We let you stay in Japan because 
we know you can handle things on your own. We wanted you to experience how to be 
independent.” He continued.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We already know what you feel about Makochan, dear. Even before you realized 
it. We saw it in your eyes whenever you talk about her or when she’s near you. And Makochan 
looks at you that way too.” Mrs. Aino hugged Minako. Minako was still crying.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your dad and I had already talked about this before I left Japan. We like 
Makochan for you. We trust her. She made a good job of taking care of you while still 
respecting our feelings towards you. She didn’t know that we knew she liked you a lot but 
she was in a way, subtle on how she acted on that feelings. She respected us as parents and 
thought about your future at the same time.” Mrs. Aino continued. Minako was now looking at 
her parents.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Besides dear, love is love. You will never control to whom you’ll fall in 
love with. You just do. If she is your home, then so be it. We’re glad you found her.” 
Minako’s dad was smiling as he told this to her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We accept you because you are our daughter my Minachan. And nothing will 
ever change that. We accept Makochan as well.” Her mom told her as she wiped away the tears 
in Minako’s cheeks.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So you’re okay with Makochan and I in a relationship?” Minako was 
surprised.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes.” Both parents answered. Minako jumped and hugged the two.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Bring our daughter in law next time, okay?” Her dad said as he teased 
Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako blushed. “I love you so much! Thanks mom and dad!” Minako said as she 
hugged her parents tightly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her parents hugged her back, stood up and walked towards the door. “Don’t 
forget that dinner’s ready. We’ll talk about your flight to Japan after, okay?” Minako’s 
mom said and then she proceeded to follow her husband downstairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako then ran towards her study table, picked up her cell phone and dialed 
a number.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">……</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s sooooo hot……” Usagi muttered as she lay at the porch of the shrine. “I 
don’t know how you can still move on this kind of heat Makochan.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have to keep myself busy or else I’ll go insane.” The brunette was still 
sweeping the shrine grounds after she cleaned the floors of the shrine.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Where is Rei anyway?” the brunette asked as she looked around.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think she got some ice from the store with Michiruchan and Harukachan.” 
Ami answered without looking at her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By the way Makochan, how is the café doing? Can we get free food when you 
guys open?” Usagi inquired, she was drooling at the thought of free ice creams, frappes, 
basically, free food. Ami sweat dropped as she was now fanning the blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“All of the paper work is done. We just have to wait for the finishing 
touches on the location then we’re all set for next week’s opening. I don’t know Usachan. I 
might go bankrupt.” Makoto laughed and put down the broom beside the stairs and was now 
sitting with the two.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Have you guys spoken to her yet? When will she come back?” Makoto wiped her 
face with a damp towel.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The two girls looked at each other. Ami gestured something to Usagi and the 
blonde nodded. “We haven’t been able to talk to her yet. Sorry Makochan.” Ami said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m going crazy already. It’s been weeks and she hasn’t called nor emailed 
me since she got there. Ugh… I’m so pathetic.” Makoto was now lying on the floor while 
fanning herself with her hands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are not pathetic Makotochan! Do not say that!” Ami almost shouted. Usagi 
nodded.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“…. Sorry.” Makoto said then she stood up. “Wait, why are they taking so long 
just to buy ice?” Makoto walked to the stairs leading to the ground and looked below to see 
if the three was already climbing the stairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ami got up and pushed Usagi until the blonde gave up and pulled Makoto back 
at the porch. “Maybe they’re still searching for ice, Makochan.” Ami said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Why do I get the feeling that all of you are planning something? Again.” 
Makoto asked while she sat again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What? That’s preposterous!” Ami answered back. Her voice became high 
pitched.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You’re not a good liar, Ami.” Makoto looked at Ami.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What? I wasn’t lying.” Ami shot back. Her eyes twitched.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Usagi was fanning herself now and was watching the two girls bicker.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You’re eyes just twitched. I know you’re planning something.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We’re not planning anything, Makochan.” Ami’s eyes twitched again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This time Makoto went over to Ami and looked the blue haired girl face to 
face. Makoto was was just an inch away from Ami’s face. Makoto then took the Ami’s face 
with both hands and asked, “Are you telling the truth?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course.” Ami tried to control the twitch but she couldn’t.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Aha! You’re lying!” Makoto jumped and pointed a finger at Ami. Ami sweat 
dropped.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Usagi was still watching. She laughed as Makoto accused Ami.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oi!” Haruka called out to the three. “Help us carry these!” Haruka, Michiru 
and Rei were holding bags of ice and ice cream as they climbed the stairs and walked 
towards the other girls.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ami saw the opportunity to escape and ran towards the other group. USagi 
followed then rummaged through the bags as Rei was still holding it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hey!” Rei shouted.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ooooh ice cream!” Usagi then ran away after getting 3 sticks of ice 
cream.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Haruka and Michiru laughed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When they got to the shrine, all of them went inside Rei’s kitchen and put 
the ice and ice cream on the fridge. Rei then excused herself for a little while as she 
went to her grandfather to give some ice cold water and ice cream.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Minachan called earlier. She said she’ll be coming next week.” Michiru said 
to Makoto as she was getting the wrapper of the ice cream.</p>
<p class="p1">“Really? That’s great!” Makoto beamed. <i>Why didn’t she call me instead? Is 
this a bad sign?</i> Makoto’s thoughts became worried. <i>Shake it off Makoto. Don’t over 
react again.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh before I forget Makochan. Can you do me a favor? Would you come with me 
tomorrow and help me move some of my things to the garage? Some of the shelves are really 
high and we’re the only two that’s tall enough to reach them.” Asked Haruka.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh sure! Sure! That will help me take my mind of things.” Makoto answered to 
the blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thanks Makochan. Pick you up by 2pm?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sure. I’ll make some sandwiches for us.” Makoto said and thought of 
recipes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sandwhices? I can help to you know!” Usagi pouted.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Haruka laughed. “Oh ok. Help Michiru clean something tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Usagi hugged Haruka.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">……</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So everything’s set?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. We figured just to order take out and just plate it nicely.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How about the flowers?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I never saw so many flowers before. Honestly. It was hard to carry those 
things.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thanks guys! Wait… how do we get in?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t worry. We already talked to the landlord and he was nice enough to 
give us the spare key.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Okay then. Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">……</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto was dropped by Haruka at her apartment after the day’s tiring work. It 
was now 8 in the evening. <i>At least I’ll just sleep when I get home. That was a very 
tiring day.</i> Makoto thought as she lazily pushed the elevator button.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When she got to her door, she noticed that there were lights flickering 
inside. <i>I didn’t leave the lights open when I left. Did I?</i> Makoto thought. She then 
took the keys from her pockets and opened the door.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her jaws dropped from what she saw.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her apartment was full of roses. Some petals were scattered on the floor, the 
couch and in the kitchen. The lights were coming from the scented candles that were placed 
inside the apartment. She saw Venus and Jupiter hugging each other at the couch and that’s 
when Minako emerged while arranging her pearl earrings from Makoto’s room in white mini 
dress and her hair was tied in knot, showing her neck.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto couldn’t believe what she’s seeing. She shut her eyes a few seconds 
then looked at Minako again. Makoto’s face went crimson red.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But… They said… You… I… Next week…” Makoto couldn’t talk straight. She 
wanted to hug the blonde but she couldn’t move.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako giggled and walked towards Makoto. She then lead the brunette towards 
the room and said, “Get dressed my Makochan.” Minako then blushed before closing the door 
behind her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It took a couple of minutes before Makoto moved from her spot. She then 
hurriedly took a shower and dressed in long sleeved shirt, slacks and shoes. She then went 
outside the room, found Minako and hugged her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Minachan… I…” Makoto’s voice trailed off. Minako put her finger unto the 
lips of the brunette and said, “Sssshhh Makochan. Let’s enjoy dinner first, okay?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto blushed and said, “Okay.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The dinner was kind of awkward for Makoto. They both didn’t talk much while 
eating but she always caught Minako staring at her but the blonde just smiled when Makoto 
looked at her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After dinner, Minako lead Makoto to the living room and whispered, “Dance 
with me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto then held Minako’s hand into hers. Before they could start, Minako 
played Makoto’s ipod that was connected to the stereo. And the blonde started to sing as 
they danced.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">When the rain is blowing in your face <br>
And the whole world is on your case <br>
I would offer you a warm embrace <br>
To make you feel my love <br>
</p>
<p class="p8">Makoto’s eyes widened. She looked at Minako and the blonde looked at her too 
while still singing.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">When the evening shadows and the stars appear <br>
And there is no one to dry your tears <br>
I could hold you for a million years <br>
To make you feel my love</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
I know you haven't made your mind up yet <br>
But I would never do you wrong <br>
I've known it from the moment that we met <br>
No doubt in my mind where you belong</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Makoto began to cry quietly. <i>Minako loves me too. But her parents, what 
about them?</i> Makoto tried to pull away a little but Minako didn’t let her.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know what you’re thinking Makochan. I already told them. They are okay 
about all of this and I should bring you with me when I visit them next time.” Minako 
whispered to Makoto’s ear as the song still played in the background.</p>
<p class="p3"><br>
I'd go hungry, I'd go blind for you <br>
I'd go crawling down the aisle for you <br>
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do <br>
To make you feel my love</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p8">“Visit? So you won’t study there? You’d stay here with me?” Makoto was now 
holding Minako’s chin towards her. Minako blushed.</p>
<p class="p3"><br>
The storms are raging on a rolling sea <br>
Down the highway of regret <br>
The winds of change are blowing wild and free <br>
But you ain't seen nothing like me yet</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p8">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br>
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do <br>
Go to the ends of the earth for you <br>
Make you happy, make your dreams come true <br>
To make you feel my love</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto bent a little then pulled Minako towards her and kissed her. Minako 
welcomed Makoto’s lips into hers and it felt good. After Makoto pulled away, she said, “I 
love you Minachan.”</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I love you too.” Minako answered then started kissing Makoto again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After a few minutes of kissing, they sat at the couch, holding each other. 
Makoto was smiling from ear to ear and so was Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The brunette leaned closer to the blonde’s ear and whispered, “Thanks for 
finding and fighting for me Minachan.” Minako blushed. The brunette then stood up and lead 
them to her room. She let Minako sit by the edge of the bed. Makoto took something from a 
drawer and sat beside Minako, facing her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Umm… Aino Minako…” Makoto then took Minako’s left hand, held it up and 
continued, “will you be my girlfriend? I mean… you know… officially.” Makoto then put the 
ring that her mom gave her, to Minako’s left ring finger and was blushing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako then jumped, held her hand up and looked at the ring. Minako giggled 
then hugged Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So is that a yes?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course my Makochan!” answered the still giggling Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto then hugged Minako and they began to kiss passionately.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto was exteremely happy because someone had fought for her and she now 
knows that she won’t be alone anymore.</p>
