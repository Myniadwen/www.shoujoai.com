Talking Through the Mind &lt;&gt;

Lunarian and any others [ ]

After the battle and the Scout met back up with Crystal everyone went 
there own way, but they agreed that it would be best that the nine 
Scouts had a meeting. Going her own way Serena met up with Darien. 
&#147;Hey Meatball-Head how would you like a nice warm meal to put in that 
stomach of yours?&#148; He said in what he hoped to be a sexy voice. &#147;I 
don&#146;t know Darien I&#146;m tried and I just want to go home and sleep,&#148; 
replied Serena as she turned to walk away but Darien would have none 
of that, since he got his memories back he has been trying to get 
Serena to his apartment but with no luck so far and since she was not 
going to come willingly he would just have to force her to come. Just 
as he was about to grab her Amara and Michelle came around the corner. 
&#147;I just think that we should tell the Princess what we know and what 
we have been seeing in our dreams Amara. It&#146;s not right for him to be 
near her. When it should be you that holds her in your arms not him. 
Please I don&#146;t care how you tell her but you have got to tell Serena 
that you love her and it&#146;s not because she is the Princess&#133;&#148; Michelle 
all of a sudden stopped talking when she looked up to see a very mad 
Prince and a confused Princess and from the looks of things the Prince 
was once again trying to get the Princess alone. Amara was the first 
to move coming at Darien hard and fast not giving him time to fight 
back. However what no one saw was Crystal coming around the corner. 
When she saw Amara and Darien fighting she went in to the fight and 
tried to help Amara. Because on the way home she got her memories 
back, she knew that Darien was bad news and that the only way to get 
rid of him was to take his memories away but as they continued to 
fight she found out that he had more ticks up his sleeve 




Ok I know that this is a cliffhanger but I am stuck. I don&#146;t know what 
to do next if any one would like to HELP me I would like. Please tell 
me what I should do next. Thank you.</pre>
