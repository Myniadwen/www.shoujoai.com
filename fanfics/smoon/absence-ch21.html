<h1>Absence (part 21 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Aiaia rested her head back on the hard stiff backed chair she was 
slumped on, Kolkhis hovering over her with a ornate paintbrush while 
muttering incomprehensible phrases, occasionally brushing her nearly 
completely unadorned armour with different coloured paints that no doubt 
contained some sort of magical power. But Aiaia ignored him and merely 
stared into space, only distantly aware of the mouldy books stacked high 
in the cramped room around her. The armoured youma&#39;s body still hurt all 
over but she was alive, the healing symbols on her enchanted metal suit 
slowly treating her wounds. The fall from her late mistress&#39;s hotel room 
had nearly killed Aiaia, but the rune-covered armour Thrinakie had 
gifted Lady Laodameia with coupled with the strong defensive magics 
weaved into it had protected the youma from the majority of the damage 
she had received. The armour-plated suit had been crafted specifically 
for Aiaia by her mistress&#146;s magically inclined older sibling when the 
youma had been appointed Lady Laodameia&#39;s head bodyguard and personal 
assistant. But Aiaia had failed in her duty.

&quot;You&#39;re the only one left of hers now,&quot; Kolkhis said offhandedly, taking 
a break from replacing and re-enchanting the runes on Aiaia&#146;s armour. 
&quot;Too bad about what happened... Laodameia was kinda hot.&quot; He gazed off 
into the distance, probably imagining doing repulsive things to Aiaia&#39;s 
mistress.

The white-haired youma flicked her eyes to the mage and glared. Kolkhis 
seemed to realise what he had said and became flustered, aware of 
Aiaia&#39;s feelings for the late Lady Laodameia. He fidgeted nervously and 
nearly dropped his paintbrush.

&quot;Err... what I meant was, with Lady Laodameia and Lord Khairephon... 
gone, all their followers back in Pandemonium will probably desert. I 
guess some will be absorbed by my master&#39;s and Lord Makareus&#39; armies, 
but you&#39;re effectively the only one left of Lady Laodameia&#146;s,&quot; Kolkhis 
hastily clarified.

The only one left. Aiaia was the only youma left of her Lady&#146;s. The only 
one left to avenge her!

&quot;You can always join up with me,&quot; Kolkhis suggested cheerfully, 
beginning to paint another protection of fire ward on Aiaia&#146;s rune 
armour, &quot;Lord Thrinakie is a good master, you know.&quot;

&quot;Maybe...&quot; Aiaia replied coldly and noncommittally. She wanted to get 
revenge on her mistress&#146;s behalf first and foremost.

&quot;And now that Lady Laodameia is, umm... no longer with us, Lord 
Thrinakie has deemed it necessary for us to engage the Sailor Senshi. I 
must say; I&#39;m not very eager to meet them...&quot; Kolkhis paused in drawing 
the symbol on Aiaia&#39;s armour and swallowed nervously. He had always been 
a coward when it came to battle.

Aiaia considered his words. She wanted the Sailor Senshi dead for what 
they had done to her mistress, but with Thrinakie&#39;s youma behind her she 
would stand a better chance obtaining her vengeance. Aiaia couldn&#39;t die 
before she had avenged Lady Laodameia, her love. But she would crush the 
life out of three specific Sailor Senshi with her bare hands- she would 
make sure that none of Thrinakie&#39;s spellcasters would dare deny her the 
pleasure... and the right.

******

It was very late at night by the time Rei and Usagi arrived at the 
Hikawa Jinja. All the way there, both girls were quiet, neither even 
glancing at the other. Rei&#39;s numerous cuts had all stopped bleeding, the 
chilly night air drying the blood and sealing the slashes. The miko had 
offered Usagi her long coat, since the girl was obviously cold, but the 
blonde had declined.

As the pair walked up the shrine&#39;s many steps, Rei became more and more 
depressed. It was strange how you could be surfing cloud nine one 
minute, and come crashing down to Earth the next. Rei kept thinking that 
maybe she had done something to cause Usagi to avoid her kiss, but for 
the life of her she couldn&#39;t come up with any valid reason. Except... 
except that Usagi was disgusted with the idea of sharing a kiss with 
her. The first time they had kissed had been at the Fire Senshi&#39;s 
instigation, and had probably caught Usagi off guard causing her to just 
go along with it. Maybe she was actually repulsed at the thought of 
kissing another girl.

Rei sighed as she and Usagi entered her room. The miko took off her 
coat, revealing bloodstained clothes beneath, and then threw it over a 
chair. The Senshi of Fire was used to being in a constant dull pain by 
now, either physically or mentally. Usagi stood in the doorway of Rei&#39;s 
bedroom, not looking sure what to do. Rei let out another sigh.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to stay, I can take care of myself,&quot; she said tiredly.

Usagi seemed to consider this for a second, but then shook her head.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll, uh... run you a b-bath,&quot; she stuttered, then abruptly 
turned around and headed towards the bathroom.

Rei watched her princess go. The miko then wandered over to her dressing 
table and leaned against it on both her hands, staring at her reflection 
in the attached mirror. A worn out looking girl stared back at her with 
haunted lavender eyes, dark rings under them. No wonder Usagi didn&#39;t 
want to kiss her; she wasn&#39;t very pretty. Rei leaned forward more and 
rested her forehead on the smooth glass of the mirror, closing her eyes. 
The girl idly noted that she had to go to school tomorrow. She was going 
to be exhausted. But Rei could always catch up on lost sleep in class... 
she could make up some excuse that recovering from the &#39;amnesia&#39; caused 
it if she were caught.

School... who cared about school anyway? That was the last thing Rei was 
worried about; she was just trying to avoid the situation. Usagi had 
rejected her. The blonde hadn&#39;t said anything as such, but she may as 
well have. Rei had known that her love for her princess would never be 
returned, but recently there had always been a minute glimmer of hope 
buried deep inside her that said there was a chance. To have that hope 
snuffed out completely was excruciatingly painful. Rei breathed out 
slowly, clouding the surface of her mirror. At least it seemed that they 
were still friends. It was better than nothing; going on in life without 
some sort of relationship with her only love would be a nightmare. Going 
on in life... Rei guessed that she had made her choice.

&quot;Rei...?&quot;

Usagi&#39;s voice woke up the Fire Senshi from her thoughts. She opened her 
eyes and stood upright, turning to face her friend.

&quot;The bath&#39;s ready,&quot; the blonde said quietly.

Rei merely nodded and followed Usagi to the bathroom.

******

Rei was aware of Usagi&#39;s eyes on her as she began to remove her clothes 
carefully, not wanting to disturb any injuries. A light blush graced the 
miko&#39;s cheeks as it dawned on her that she was stripping in front of her 
princess. Rei spared a circumspect glance at Usagi, and saw that she was 
now looking away from her, blushing also. Rei smiled sadly. She looked 
so cute.

Once Rei was down to her underwear, she started to unwrap her bandaged 
body but hesitated, pausing with a strip of the white cloth held in one 
hand. Usagi was already sickened by the Fire Senshi; seeing her scarred, 
half-healed appearance would be enough to send her running.

&quot;Does it hurt?&quot; Usagi asked, noticing Rei&#146;s uncertainty. &quot;Do you want me 
to help?&quot;

Rei shook her head, not looking at the girl. &quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt,&quot; she 
whispered.

The miko resumed unwrapping her bandages, her eyes tightening in pain 
when some of the cloth would stick stubbornly to the blood incrusted 
wounds. As Rei removed the bandages, she could hear Usagi&#39;s sharp intake 
of breath at the sight of the many hideous cuts and bruises that 
decorated her battle-weary body. The wounds would heal in time, not even 
leaving any permanent scars due to Sailor Senshi healing, but Rei had 
never felt more self-conscious than she did now. Once she was finished, 
the Senshi of Fire raised her arms slightly as if to hug herself and 
hide how ugly she had become. Rei risked a sideways glance at Usagi, to 
gauge how horrified and revolted she was.

Her princess gazed at her ruined body with misty eyes, taking in the 
price of combat. &quot;Rei... I didn&#39;t think they would be this bad...&quot; Usagi 
whispered.

Rei gave a small half-smile without humour. So, she was more repulsive 
than Usagi had thought she would have been. &quot;Yeah... some youma in 
Yokohama got a few lucky shots in,&quot; she murmured morosely. But no youma 
had hurt her as much as her true love had.

Rei let the stray thought leave her mind. Despite how much pain her love 
for Usagi caused her, she wouldn&#39;t stop feeling how she did about her 
princess.

The Fire Senshi flinched as she felt Usagi touch the outline of the old 
stab wound in her side, causing the blonde to pull back her hand 
quickly.

&quot;Oh! Did I hurt you?&quot; she squeaked in concern.

&quot;N-No, it&#39;s just that... I thought now that you&#39;ve seen... what I look 
like, that you wouldn&#39;t want to... touch me anymore...&quot; Rei explained 
haltingly, feeling more vulnerable than ever.

&quot;Rei...&quot; Usagi sighed, &quot;why would you think a thing like th- oh...&quot; Her 
words trailed off as memory of the rejected kiss came back to her.

The pair stood on the bathroom tiles together in silence. After a 
moment, Usagi looked at the cooling bathwater. &quot;You should get in the 
bath before it gets cold,&quot; she suggested, changing the subject.

Rei simply nodded and reached behind herself to take off her bra. She 
stopped, blushing, and looked at Usagi, then at the bubble-free 
bathwater and then back at Usagi again. The blonde blinked at Rei for a 
second in confusion and then turned beet red. She swallowed nervously 
before putting on a smile.

&quot;You&#39;ve n-nothing I haven&#39;t seen before,&quot; Usagi stammered, despite the 
fact that she was aware that circumstances had changed between them and 
that she wouldn&#39;t just look at Rei&#39;s body in merely friendly appraisal 
anymore.

Rei gathered her courage and removed her underwear, then carefully 
stepped into the tub and sat down in the soothing water. She sighed 
deeply and ignored the needles of pain that the hot water caused in her 
exposed lacerations. Rei relaxed gingerly back in the tub, trying not to 
disturb the burns and slashes on her back. She tilted her head back, 
wetting her hair, and then closed her eyes. The Fire Senshi could 
practically feel Usagi&#39;s eyes all over her exposed figure, committing 
every detail to memory. Rei wondered how long she had held out not 
looking for. It was almost enough to make the miko grin in amusement. 
Almost.

Rei heard her princess kneel beside the bathtub. There was a rattling as 
Usagi grabbed something followed by a squirting sound. Rei cracked open 
her eyes and looked at the blonde odango atama. Usagi met her gaze 
nervously. She was holding a bottle of shampoo.

&quot;I should, uh...&quot; Usagi mumbled, gesturing with the shampoo at Rei. 
&quot;It&#39;s why I&#39;m here after all, right? Well, not to wash your hair but to, 
you know,&quot; she babbled in a falsely cheerful voice, waving with one hand 
at Rei&#39;s scarred body.

The Senshi of Fire just nodded and sat up, before shutting her eyes once 
more. She heard the squirting sound again and then felt hands in her 
hair, rubbing the raven locks gently. As Usagi massaged her scalp, Rei 
let her mind drift and her muscles relax, enjoying the sensation. It was 
probably the only time her princess would do something like this for 
her, and the miko intended to remember and take pleasure in ever second 
of the experience.

Neither spoke as Usagi finished washing Rei&#39;s hair and then rinsed it, 
before she proceeded to pick up a washcloth. She squeezed some liquid 
soap on the material and began to do the task she had come here with her 
friend for. Usagi delicately cleaned her bodyguard&#39;s rips and stabs, 
washing away the caked blood and grime. Rei held back a groan as Usagi 
started to massage her right shoulder, the joint having been dislocated 
before. She felt the stiffness leave her shoulder as her princess worked 
on it firmly yet carefully. The blonde then moved on to her old stab 
wound, paying extra special attention and care to the grievous injury.

&quot;You should have got stitches...&quot; she murmured absently as she washed.

Rei said nothing and continued to delight in Usagi&#39;s healing touch.

The bathwater was getting somewhat cold by the time Usagi finished 
cleaning all of Rei&#39;s wounds, and the miko was starting to feel the 
chill. The blonde odango atama, who had seemed to become more 
comfortable with the Fire Senshi&#39;s naked form, gestured for the girl to 
rise and get out of the tub. Rei obeyed her princess, and Usagi draped a 
fluffy towel around the girl&#39;s shoulders and then started to dry her 
raven hair with another towel. Once finished, Usagi wrapped Rei&#39;s hair 
up in a towel on top of her head, and picked up the second towel around 
her best friend&#146;s shoulders. Rei idly wondered why her princess never 
suggested that she dry herself, but the thought was quickly banished 
when Usagi started to lovingly dry her body, the blonde&#39;s cheeks graced 
with a pink hue all the while. The miko blushed furiously as her 
princess moved on to more sensitive areas, and she desperately tried to 
keep the ecchi thoughts out of her mind, only partially succeeding.

Once the pleasurable ordeal was over, Usagi wrapped a towel around Rei 
and took her hand in one of her own. Rei swallowed hard as her princess 
led her back to the bedroom, causing the Senshi of Fire&#146;s ecchi thoughts 
to flare up again. Usagi sat Rei down on the futon and walked over to 
the medical supplies that were spread out all over the top of the miko&#39;s 
dresser. She grabbed a bundle of bandages and medical pads, and also a 
bottle of burn ointment. Usagi returned to Rei&#39;s side and dumped the 
medical supplies on the floor near her, and then sat beside the wounded 
girl somewhat breathlessly, her cheeks still pink. The blonde odango 
atama casually pulled off Rei&#39;s towel, but being careful not to 
aggravate the Fire Senshi&#146;s unprotected wounds. Rei blushed again as she 
was suddenly exposed once more. Usagi picked up the bandages and medical 
pads, and proceeded to treat all of her bodyguard&#39;s gashes and stabs, 
delicately and tenderly dressing the wounds.

&quot;Lie on your stomach,&quot; Usagi whispered once she was done with the 
bandaging.

Rei gulped but nodded and complied with her princess&#39;s order. Her senses 
were all overloaded, and she didn&#39;t know what was going on. Rei had 
thought Usagi didn&#39;t have any romantic feelings towards her, that she 
would be disgusted to even consider the possibility. Hadn&#39;t Usagi drawn 
away from her kiss? It was possible all this was just a friendly 
gesture, but Rei knew that was quite a stretch. The raven-haired girl 
was totally confused, but definitely wasn&#39;t complaining. She felt the 
glimmer of hope inside her revive, giving her something to hold on to 
and pray for. Rei noted that the odd calling deep inside her that had 
appeared in the confrontation with Khairephon had increased in its 
intensity, becoming even more apparent that it was hard to ignore.

Rei continued to blush like fury as she lay face down on her futon, 
acutely aware that Usagi could probably see *everything*. Why the hell 
hadn&#146;t Rei covered herself?! Why hadn&#146;t *Usagi* covered her?! The burns 
were only on the miko&#146;s back!

The flustered senshi twitched as she felt a cold and wet substance land 
on her back. After a moment, she felt Usagi&#39;s warm, soft, smooth hands 
join the substance and begin rubbing it gently into her Crescent Beam 
burn. A groan escaped Rei&#39;s mouth as her princess increased the pressure 
of her rubbing and moved away from the burn, beginning to give the Fire 
Senshi a deep and relaxing massage, turning her muscles to goo. The miko 
moaned in ecstasy as Usagi continued, the blonde starting to hum 
happily. Rei prayed that Yuuichirou and her Grandpa were sleeping like 
logs.

Suddenly Usagi stopped humming and Rei felt her love&#39;s hands abruptly 
leave her back. She glanced over her shoulder at her princess, and saw a 
look of total shock and mortification on her face. As Rei watched on, 
Usagi&#39;s face got redder and redder, so much so that the miko thought she 
was going to spontaneously combust on the spot. Usagi looked at Rei&#39;s 
naked form with bugged out eyes as if just realising that the girl was 
indeed bare to the world.

&quot;What... what am I doing?!&quot; she cried. &quot;No... no, no, no, no, no. I 
shouldn&#39;t be doing this! I&#39;m with Mamoru!&quot; She leapt to her feet, 
backing away from Rei in horror. &quot;I&#39;m with Mamoru!&quot; Usagi repeated 
vehemently. &quot;I love him, you know! I don&#39;t- I don&#39;t like girls like 
that! I-I&#39;m sorry Rei, but- but I should get outa here!&quot; she babbled 
half incoherently and turned hastily away from Rei, shutting her eyes 
tight, most likely trying to dispel the view of her best friend&#39;s nude 
body from her mind.

Before her princess fled the room, Rei quickly sat up and called out to 
her desperately. &quot;Wait! Please, Usagi, wait! We have to talk! We still 
haven&#39;t yet, please stay!&quot;

Usagi shook her head emphatically, her back still to the miko. &quot;I can&#39;t, 
I, uh... have school tomorrow at it&#39;s really late already, so I should 
go.&quot; She started to bolt towards the door.

Rei reacted on reflex and moved like quicksilver, grabbing Usagi&#39;s wrist 
before she could run away, grabbing on to that glimmer of hope.

&quot;Gah! Let go, Rei!&quot; Usagi wailed frantically, pulling at her arm like 
the Fire Senshi was a rabid wolf.

&quot;NO!&quot; Rei yelled, causing her princess to cease her struggling and look 
at the raven-haired girl warily. &quot;I can&#39;t take this anymore, you can&#39;t 
just tease me like this then run away! We *have* to talk about what 
happened, damn it!&quot;

Usagi recoiled as Rei shouted, appearing frightened. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said 
meekly, looking down at the floor.

Rei blinked at the blonde and then released her grasp on the girl. 
&quot;Good,&quot; she said in a much softer tone.

&quot;Could you at least put some clothes on?&quot; Usagi asked timidly.

Rei looked down at herself, just realising that she was still in her 
birthday suit. She glanced at Usagi, making sure she wouldn&#39;t take off, 
then walked to her wardrobe and pulled out a dressing gown, putting it 
on.

Rei let out a fatigued sigh as she sat on her futon, indicating that 
Usagi should sit next to her with a pat of her hand on it. The blonde 
girl hesitated for a second, but then reluctantly complied. They both 
sat in silence for a while, both lost in their own thoughts of what to 
say. Inwardly, Rei cursed. She hadn&#146;t wanted this to happen, really. 
Even though she had hoped that Usagi would return her feelings one day, 
she had also hoped that her princess would never find out about them. It 
complicated things. Rei was forcing her true love into a position where 
she would have to choose between her best friend and Mamoru. She had 
sworn she wouldn&#39;t do that to Usagi, but nevertheless, here they were. 
In truth, Rei knew that it had to lead to this point. If her princess 
hadn&#39;t kissed her back at the Rihga Royal Hotel, the Fire Senshi would 
have certainly self-destructed by now.

&quot;Usagi...&quot; Rei started awkwardly, &quot;you know how I feel now... even 
though I haven&#39;t said the words. I never intended to ever let you find 
out but... it just got... too painful to hold in anymore. What I did to- 
to Minako was just the last straw on a whole lot of things that&#39;s 
happened to me. I just... cracked.

&#147;But then you came and you saved me, you let me kiss you,&quot; Rei went on, 
&quot;and I thought it meant something to you, at least, it felt like it 
did... but then afterwards... and then Mamoru... it hurt...&quot; She trailed 
off, tears beginning to form in her eyes.

Rei closed her mouth, not knowing what else to say. Not that she could 
continue anyway. She swallowed the lump forming in her throat. Usagi 
remained quiet, fidgeting with a leftover bandage on the futon. Finally, 
she spoke.

&quot;I care about you, Rei,&quot; Usagi said quietly, &quot;you&#39;re my best friend... 
when I lost you, it was terrible, I had never been more miserable... but 
then you came back, and it was if I was given a second chance. I was so 
happy, but... you were, *are*, different. At first I thought it was only 
my imagination, but it&#39;s not, and the others notice it too.&quot;

Rei said nothing and simply stared at the wooden floorboards in front on 
her, waiting for Usagi to continue.

&quot;After Minako... I realised. I heard the things you said and overheard 
what you asked Ami. And this morning, at my house, when you woke me 
up... there were other, little things, too I noticed. Glances, touches, 
things like that. I&#39;m not the total ditz you think I am, I can see the 
signs and add two and two together. But after what happened in the 
hotel, that&#39;s when I knew what was bothering you...&quot;

Usagi paused. Rei knew what was coming now. She steeled herself for the 
blow.

&quot;But...&quot; Usagi continued, and Rei closed her eyes tightly, &quot;I love 
Mamoru. I always will, we are meant to be. I care about you, Rei, I 
really do, please believe me, but not... that, way. The things we did... 
I just got carried away, I wasn&#39;t thinking clearly... I just liked 
taking care of you for once. I&#39;m so sorry, Rei, please don&#39;t hate me, 
I&#39;ll always be your friend... don&#39;t do anything rash, please...&quot; The 
Fire Senshi heard her princess start to cry.

Rei remained where she was with her head down and her eyes shut. So 
there it was, completely spelled out for her. There was no mistake, no 
misunderstanding; this was it. It was so... final. Rei felt her heart 
crumble to dust. She wanted to burn something.

&quot;You&#39;ll find someone else, Rei, I know you will... you&#39;re very 
beautiful, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of guys, ah, girls that will jump 
at the chance to be with you,&quot; Usagi tried to console the miko.

&quot;I only want one girl,&quot; Rei stated, somewhat coldly.

Usagi was quiet for a moment, before she spoke once again. &quot;I-I&#39;m 
sorry... I don&#39;t love you, I love Mamoru... you know we are to be 
together forever; it&#39;s our destiny...&quot;

There was that word again, destiny. Rei was really sick of that word. If 
Usagi said &#39;fate&#39; next the Senshi of Fire was going to scream.

&quot;Please, Rei, don&#39;t do anything you&#39;ll regret. You weren&#39;t like this 
before; you&#39;re not the same since you came back. You used to have more 
compassion; you used to be... nicer, even if you were cranky sometimes. 
You... scare me...&quot;

Rei swallowed and opened her eyes. No tears fell. &quot;I know I scare you... 
but you shouldn&#39;t be scared, I&#39;ll never hurt you, no matter what. I 
still have a duty to you princess, and I intend to perform it.&quot;

Usagi nodded apprehensively, tears rolling down her cheeks. &quot;O-Okay... 
I-I&#39;m really sorry, Rei... w-we&#146;re still friends, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

Rei turned to look at her sobbing princess, seeing her distraught 
expression. The miko was back to square one; nothing had changed. No, 
that wasn&#39;t true, some things had changed. All hope inside her had died. 
Whatever friendship she had now with Usagi would be affected, 
implications being read into every small touch and look she shared with 
the girl. But you took what you could get.

Rei gave a forced smile. &quot;Sure we are, if you still want to be,&quot; she 
said, trying to put some enthusiasm in her voice for Usagi&#39;s sake.

Usagi smiled broadly at her friend. &quot;Oh, thank you, Rei! I&#39;m so glad!&quot; 
she gushed.

The blonde girl reached out to hug Rei, but the raven-haired miko drew 
back. Usagi&#39;s face fell.

&quot;I... just need some time... could you leave?&quot; Rei requested quietly. 
&quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, all right?&quot; She smiled thinly.

Usagi nodded slowly at her, looking crest-fallen. &quot;S-Sure... I&#39;ll... see 
you...&quot;

Rei returned her gaze to the floor as Usagi left her bedroom. In many 
ways this Hell was far worse than the previous one she had experienced 
in Yokohama. But at least she still had Usagi&#39;s friendship. She would 
have to live off that. Rei continued to stare at the floor, as if 
mentally trying to burn a hole through it. It was strange, she felt the 
pain, but the tears wouldn&#39;t come. Maybe she had run out.

With Rei buried in self-pity, she never saw the last glance her princess 
gave her before departing.
