<p><u>Earlier</u> (<u>Haruka’s POV)</u></p>
<p>Ah…speeding in a sweet  motorcycle during the night always feels great after a workout. The  humming motor is music to my ears. Streetlights shone overhead,  reflecting themselves off my body in all directions, articulating the  luster of my leather jacket. Always dress to look cool, never know  who’s watching you even if it’s after midnight. A tight pair of  jeans gripped my slender legs as I pushed the gas pedal and my hands  gripped the handlebars harder when the burst of speed came.</p>
<p>Only one thing was better than riding a motorcycle and  that was riding a motorcycle with Michiru; having her arms wrap  themselves tightly around my waist, feeling her pressed against my  back.</p>
<p>At that moment I made a sharp right hand  turn. The cuffs of my jacket pushed back with tension and the battle  wounds came into view once more. They were nothing really. I was  lucky that the enemy was as weak as it was. A few scratches…  perhaps insignificant scrapes on my arms and legs but nothing that  would stick out of the normal. Perfect actually, now I can tell coach  that I got’em while training, wouldn’t he be surprised. He’d be  ‘oh you’re so devoted, take some time off.’ Its not like I’m  slacking off, I mean, I always go for my own little runs regularly.  It’s just that I have more important things to do at the moment.  Like less training time equals more time I with Michiru.</p>
<p>Looking down into one of the side mirrors I could see myself  grinning through the visor of my helmet. Uh…saving the world that  is! I <em>wish</em> it’d be more than that though.</p>
<p>I pushed  my foot down on the speed pedal again, urging the vehicle to push its  limits. Now where was I going again? Hmm…Oh yeah, to Michiru’s!  She’d probably appreciate it if I told her how my mission went face  to face instead of over the phone. I’ll tell her how easy it was  and after she’s impressed I’ll flash her a winning smile. It  would be perfect, it could be. But…the heart crystal was a dud. How  would she react to that?</p>
<p>My knuckles must’ve been turning  white under my leather gloves. I was glad…Damn! I was glad that it  was a dud. If it weren’t, that girl would’ve died. Could I really  kill someone? Someone I’ve never met before, someone innocent with  their whole life ahead of them? There were times when I feel into  periods of despair, I remember sitting in the corner of my apartment.  Sitting with my legs’ bent up, pressed against my chest, repeating  the question like a mantra.</p>
<p>It scares me. What if we failed?  No! W-we won’t. Michiru and I promised each other we won’t, <strong>I</strong> promised her.</p>
<p>A thought had struck me just then. Michiru!  Her target, did…no, she can’t, couldn’t, wouldn’t…she just  can’t! The image of the aqua goddess with a broken will and empty  eyes flashed past my eyes. Michiru is too kind hearted, if she had to  take a life it would have devastating effects. She’s pure, lives  life to the fullest and treats everyone with kindness, even those who  may not deserve it. Even someone like me. Michiru…taking a life,  destroying herself and staining her delicate hands. Or worse…Losing  her own life. How could I live with myself if I lost her? That can’t  happen!</p>
<p>“I’m an idiot!” I growled loudly.</p>
<p>Passing  the final stretch quickly, down the tarred road her house came into  view. She lived out by the ocean. The dark water’s splashes were  droned out by my bike’s motor. Just a bit further, please be all  right.</p>
<p>I came to a stop in front of her house. Seeing none  of its lights were on fueled my fears. Worry washed over me. Clumsily  I somewhat tripped dismounting from my vehicle and ran straight for  the door, leaving the bike to fall over onto the semi barren ground.</p>
<p>“Michiru!”</p>
<p>My fists bombarded the door as I  called her name in panic. Do you know why I had accepted this  destiny? I rapped the door harder. It’s  because…because…</p>
<p>“Haruka?”</p>
<p>Michiru opened the  door slowly and peered up at me through tired eyes, her eyelids  fluttered briefly.</p>
<p>“Michiru…”</p>
<p>The real reason  why I accepted this destiny was not because I couldn’t escape from  it.</p>
<p>“Haruka, first you decide to go for a early morning  ride…” She peers at the grounded motorcycle behind me. “Then  you go banging on my door and wake me up. What do you have to say for  yourself?” She threw me a teasing smile.</p>
<p>It was all to  protect that smile. I wanted to protect her, everything of her. Just  looking at her now, I could do it. If it meant taking a life instead  of her performing the deed, then so be it. My resolve strengthened a  hundred fold that moment.</p>
<p>“I…well…”</p>
<p>“It’s  all right Haruka, you know I’m just teasing. What did you want to  talk about?”</p>
<p>“W-well, I wanted to tell you about how the  mission went.”</p>
<p>The color seemed to drain from her cheeks.  Did something happen after all?</p>
<p>“Come in, it’s better to  talk inside.”</p>
<p>I followed her in, making sure to take off my  shoes and my leather jacket before we sat down in the living room.  Michiru must’ve noticed my shivering because she lighted the  fireplace. For awhile none of us spoke. In silence I watched her seat  herself on the couch opposite of me and our eyes slowly met.</p>
<p>“It…it  wasn’t what we were looking for.” I finally broke the silence.  What else could I’ve said? It went good? It went bad? Neither would  work as the sentence could be interpreted in many different ways.  Better be careful about what I say.</p>
<p>Michiru blankly stared up  at me and then bit her lower lip for a moment. There was guilt in  those aqua eyes.</p>
<p>“Michiru…?” She shook her head. To my  surprise she started to fidget slightly. “W-what’s wrong?”  Momentarily she lifted her face and I saw that tears had started to  form.</p>
<p>Without another thought I propelled myself off the  couch and was at her side, taking her shaking form into a protective  embrace.</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry Haruka…” She sobbed  softly.</p>
<p>“Michi, what happened? You can tell me, I’m here  for you.” Trust me, please.</p>
<p>“I let her go…”</p>
<p>“…”  I waited for her to continue.</p>
<p>“She… they… the enemy  never came for her. I just…I’m sorry Haruka.”</p>
<p>So that  meant three things. One, we still don’t know if this girl has a  talisman hidden in her pure heart. Two and three, the most important,  Michiru is all right for the most part and she didn’t have to kill  anyone. I could almost jump in joy. I looked down at her face once  more. Her eyes reflected guilt but…</p>
<p>“It’s okay Michi.  Don’t worry about it. It’ll all turn out.” She backed out of my  embrace and studied my face. I flashed her my winning smile.</p>
<p>The  soft, warm glow emitted from the fireplace danced across the sea  goddess’s tear stained face. I wished I could tell her how  beautiful she was, how much she really meant to me. Instead, I gently  wiped the remaining tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>The guilt and  sadness in those aqua orbs were soon replaced with weariness. Slowly  she leaned in and gave me a small kiss on my cheek. A light blush  came over my face and darkened crimson when the smaller woman leaned  into me before falling asleep.</p>
<p>Everything felt so right.</p>
<p>I continued to watch her peaceful form and indulged in the  sounds of her soft breaths. I will protect her, whatever the  cost.</p>
<p><u>Morning</u></p>
<p>“Haruka, wake up! We’ll be  late if you don’t hurry!”</p>
<p>“J-just a few more minutes…”  I lay sprawled over the couch, the warm leather against my cheek felt  so soft, I didn’t want to move. Who needs school anyway?</p>
<p>“Haruka…”  Came the annoyed reply.</p>
<p><strong>Sploosh.</strong></p>
<p>“Gah! I’m  up, I’m awake!” Water drenched my hair and had nicked the couch.  I looked up to glare at Michiru, who wasn’t even trying to hide the  deed. She turned and strolled towards the kitchen with the bowl in  her hands. I noticed that she had already dressed into her school  uniform. Damn, which reminds me, I’ll have to change at  school.</p>
<p>“Be sure to wipe the water off the couch Haruka.”  She giggled. “I’m sure you’d like to eat breakfast  right?”</p>
<p>“I’m on it…” I grumbled. Translation was,  ‘clean the couch or no breakfast’.</p>
<p>Moments later I  strolled into the kitchen where the sea goddess was in the middle of  preparing meal. Glancing over at the sink ahead, I flicked my wrist  and the soaked wash rag flew cleanly up and into the metal bin.</p>
<p><strong>Flop.</strong></p>
<p>“Score.” I commented smugly.</p>
<p>“Would  you rather have two points or bacon n’ eggs?” Michiru questioned,  she turned to look at me, diverting her eyes from the frying  pan.</p>
<p>Well, I actually would have another kiss but I repressed  the urge. She’s acting like yesterday never happened.</p>
<p>“I  think you should know the answer.”</p>
<p>“Two points it is  then.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>After eating both of us had ran  out of the house a half-hour before the school bell was scheduled to  ring. Of course I ran to my motorcycle, picking it up and waited for  Michiru. Instead Michiru looked at me somewhat annoyed.</p>
<p>“Haruka,  we’re taking the car.”</p>
<p>“Nani?”</p>
<p>“Your such a  speed demon, it’s not safe during the early mornings, you’re just  too reckless.”</p>
<p>“B-but…”</p>
<p>“Haruka…”</p>
<p>I  sighed and gave in. Soon my bike was locked into the garage and I  hopped into the car.</p>
<p>“Can I drive?” I asked hopeful. If  anything I should at least get to drive.</p>
<p>“Oh all right, but  remember, no speeding.” Michiru gave out a frustrated sigh. Being  late for school was an unspeakable sin for her.</p>
<p>“Yes!” We  switched places and soon I was at the gas pedal. Who could resist?  Speeding a little over the limit never hurt anyone. I slammed my foot  onto the pedal.</p>
<p>“HARUKA!” Michiru yelled.</p>
<p>We did  manage to get to school on time. Michiru scolded me the entire way  from the parking lot into class but who cares? You could tell she  really enjoyed it, the way her eyes twinkled behind that fake  exasperated mask.</p>
<p>After I changed into my uniform we both  went to class. Ah yes, class was a bore as ever. It was always the  same; people go to school, girls drool over the guys and the teachers  drone on for a good hour and twenty minutes.</p>
<p>I  glanced over to Michiru who was paying strict attention as always. At  least one of us was. My arm started to fall asleep from resting my  dead weight head on it for so long. With my free hand I dove into my  school bag and pulled out a racing magazine. Guess who was on the  front cover? I found myself grinning as I read up the gossip on me.  These writers really have some wild imaginations.</p>
<p>Shortly  after a knock came at the door. As the teacher moved to address the  disturbance the class sprang to life, chattering about their day and  such. However I was too absorbed in my magazine to  notice.</p>
<p>“Students, we have a new student, please make her  feel welcome.” Mr. Yoshi announced.</p>
<p>To my surprise the  noise level rose, but even then I did not look up. What was the  point? It was probably just another rich kid.</p>
<p>“Haruka…”  Michiru whispered.</p>
<p>“Mmm?” She roughly elbowed me hard in  the ribs. “Hey! Why did you…?”</p>
<p>I stopped when I saw she  wasn’t looking at me. Turning my head I looked at what had caught  her attention. A blond girl had walked into the room. Shoulder length  hair, shorter than me but taller than Michiru and…aqua eyes? I  quickly glanced back to Michiru who looked like she seen a  ghost.</p>
<p>“That’s her Haruka…” Michi  started.</p>
<p>“Konnichiwa...” The room fell silent. “Watashi  wa Tenou Kaiya. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“She’s the target  that I…”</p>
<p>Michi didn’t have to say more. So that was  her, the one we should watch out for. The girl, Kaiya was it? She  peered around the room, almost looking for something until her gaze  stopped on Michiru and I. The whole room seemed to melt away, as  though the three of us were the only ones in the room. I held my  gaze, not wanting to be the one to back down, Michiru did the  same.</p>
<p>“Tenou san, you may take a seat over by Kaioh  san.”</p>
<p>The girl gave the teacher a quick alarmed glance but  then reluctantly nodded her head. This was going perfectly, it  shouldn’t be hard to make friends with her; she’s in our class,  approximately our age and now she’s going to sit next to us! Maybe  luck was on our side after all.</p>
<p>The blond walked up the  stairs towards us, ignoring the wolf whistles of the male population.  She had pride, the way she carried herself without her face revealing  any sort of evidence of being fazed by the introduction. I moved out  of my desk to let her sit between Michiru and myself.</p>
<p>“So,  Kaiya is it?” I tried to open a friendly conversation.</p>
<p>“Class  is starting.” She clearly stated without looking at my face.</p>
<p>“Ouch, did you see that? Tenoh got shot down.” A few  voices snickered behind my back. I could feel the heat of  embarrassment burn my face.</p>
<p>Michiru didn’t say anything.  She continued to look down at her notes and had started to scribble  down what the teacher started to teach next.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p>I know Haruka was only trying to start a  conversation but wow, it was really amusing to see that girl put  Haruka in her place. Her face was so shocked. I guess we can assume  this girl, Kaiya, is an academic sort of person. If she was more  interested in class than making conversation.</p>
<p><em>Brrrring.</em></p>
<p>People  all around us moved to packed their books and started out the door to  class two. Kaiya fumbled around with her notes, picking up different  pens and shoving them into her bag quickly. Poor soul, she looks so  disorganized.</p>
<p>“Want to talk now?” Haruka tried  again.</p>
<p>To my surprise Kaiya flashed a smile to Haruka and  then bluntly stated,</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The new student rushed  down the steps and out the door before Haruka could come up with a  decent comeback.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Haruka cried out, that was twice  she got shot down today.</p>
<p>“Haruka, you may be losing your  touch.” I couldn’t help but giggle at her wounded pride.</p>
<p>“No  way, just watch Michi! No girl can resist my charm.” She flashed me  another smile.</p>
<p>In truth, seeing that smile made my stomach do  a flip flop but I wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction of  letting her know that.</p>
<p>“Right, well there may be two girls  that might have that sort of immunity.”</p>
<p>Haruka blinked and  looked at me for moment, until she finally understood the statement.  Sometimes she can be a bit slow.</p>
<p>“We’ll just have to see  won’t we?”</p>
<p>She brushed past me and made chase after  Kaiya. This could be interesting. I picked up my things and followed  the blondes.</p>
<p>“Hey! Hold up!” Haruka was yelling. She was  chasing the other blond who had also just broken into a run.</p>
<p>“Stop  chasing me!” Kaiya yelled over her shoulder, her bag beating her  back.</p>
<p>“Not until…you listen!”</p>
<p>“Stalker!”</p>
<p>Okay,  so maybe Haruka was overdoing it just a bit. People rushed out of  their way as they thundered down the hallways. Even I had a bit of  trouble keeping up so I rushed down a different route, hoping to cut  them off at the pass.</p>
<p>“What are you, deaf!” I could hear  Kaiya scream.</p>
<p>“What did you say!”</p>
<p>The voices were  getting louder. I stood near the end of the hallway, listening as the  two approached at a rapid pace. Really I didn’t know why I was  doing this. It just seemed like fun.</p>
<p>Kaiya turned the corner  and was heading straight towards me.</p>
<p>“Like a game of tag.”  I muttered, then smiled at the thought.</p>
<p>“Don’t look  down.” Kaiya yelled to me.</p>
<p>But if someone tells you not to  do something, as I am a teenager, I did what a teenager would’ve  done…do the opposite.</p>
<p>“Huh?” I looked down for a split  second, puzzled at why she had said it.</p>
<p>“Let’s change the  game, leap frog!”</p>
<p>Two hands hit my shoulders. I was numbly  aware that her figure was flipping over me.</p>
<p>“Michiru!”  Haruka yelled.</p>
<p>My head shot up too late as Haruka came  crashing into me, sending us both sprawling across the  floor.</p>
<p>“Oof!”</p>
<p>Not again…</p>
<p>“Haruka, why  do you always end up on top of me?” I asked, rather annoyed. I was  still grouchy about losing that last one on one encounter of ‘leap  frog’.</p>
<p>“Ah…well you see…” My partner tried to  explain.</p>
<p>“Is that what you do? You’re such a pervert.”  Kaiya was grinning ear to ear as if she just uncovered Haruka’s  most embarrassing secret.</p>
<p>“No! It’s not like that!”  Haruka defended herself.</p>
<p>“My eyes don’t lie.” The other  blond replied, articulating each word. She now stood a few steps away  from my head.</p>
<p>Oh dear, battle of the blondes.</p>
<p>“It was an accident.”</p>
<p>“Was it? You sure look  like you’re enjoying yourself, you haven’t even made the attempt  to get off.”</p>
<p>There was a silence. It just clicked that  Haruka was still hovering over me.</p>
<p>“Haruka…” I warned  her.</p>
<p>Haruka jumped up and away from the two of us, blushing  like there was no tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Michiru…it was really an  accident.” Haruka started to apologize.</p>
<p>“I’m sure, just  like the other time.” I thought back to the time when she fell from  the tree.</p>
<p>“You mean it happened more than once?” Kaiya  asked, there was an odd glint in her eye.</p>
<p>“Well…yes.”   No point in hiding the truth now.</p>
<p>“But that was an accident  too!” My partner cried.</p>
<p>“So what are you saying? You’re  sexually accident prone?” Kaiya raised an eyebrow. I was sure she  was enjoying torturing Haruka. But it really made sense, what she was  getting at.</p>
<p>“Haruka, are you not telling me something?” I  asked in a serious tone. It actually was entertaining to watch the  great senshi of the wind sweat it out.</p>
<p>“N-no. I’d never  hide anything from you!”</p>
<p>“What? You’re positively  sure?”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, lover’s spat.” Kaiya remarked.</p>
<p>“WE  ARE NOT A COUPLE!” Haruka and I both exclaimed at once, pointing to  each other.</p>
<p>“Could’ve fooled me, you guys sure argue like  one.”</p>
<p>I could feel my cheeks burn. Haruka as my…? Umm,  no, I furiously shook my head of the thought.</p>
<p>“Since when do  you think you can comment on someone’s love life?” My partner  accusingly pointed at her blond counterpart.</p>
<p>“Oh, so you  admit you have a love life?”</p>
<p>“Er…Shut up!”</p>
<p>“Should  I just go then?” The shorter blond inquired. Her arms were crossed,  studying Haruka carefully.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you know what? Just  go!”</p>
<p>“All right, if you say so.”</p>
<p>I watched Kaiya  brush by the two of us and into the next hallway. She was whistling  something while pulling out the school map. Good thing Haruka and I  have a spare this block, that chasing took up a lot of our time.  Wait…</p>
<p>“Haruka, did you just tell her to go away?” This  was just for the measure.</p>
<p>“Umm…yeah.”</p>
<p>“After  you spent all that time chasing her?”:</p>
<p>The realization  slowly dawned on her face. Well, you could tell who was the smarter  one between the blondes…poor Haruka.</p>
<p>“Forget about it for  now Haruka, you can try becoming friends later.” I pulled at her  arm to drag her away. Right now I wanted her to spend time with me.  Maybe I was a little jealous at how well the two blondes got  along.</p>
<p>“Oh, all right.” She sighed. “But I won’t  lose! Just watch.”</p>
<p>“Hai, hai…” Using my fingernails I  brushed my hair back a bit and then breathed deeply for a few breaths  to regain some of my composure. That little incident brought out the  childish side to me. I’m usually not like that, not at all.</p>
<p>Looking back at the tall blond I noticed that she was  staring. As quick as I looked up she whipped her head away to evade  my eyes. Isn’t that cute? I couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>“Shall  we?” Haruka finally said, offering me her arm.</p>
<p>“Let’s…”</p>
<p>There  will be other times to befriend the target.</p>
<p><u>Shortly  after lunch</u></p>
<p>The aggressive approach almost never  works, so I guess I’m up.</p>
<p>How to go about it though? Hmm…I  made my way around the school until I reached the art room. I always  could think clearly there; it’s far off down a particular wing  where hardly anyone passes and it’s much quieter.</p>
<p>As I  neared the door I noticed that the light had been turned on. There  shouldn’t be any classes at this time, weren’t any before. A few  scratching sounds could be heard inside. As I opened the door I saw  the blond from earlier.</p>
<p>“Kaiya…?”</p>
<p>She either  didn’t hear me or chose to ignore me. Probably the first one as she  was staring intensely at a canvas with a pencil in her hand.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”  The blond scratched her head and then crossed her legs. “Maybe…No…”  She leaned into the canvas and eyed something I couldn’t quite see.  If I move just a little closer…</p>
<p>I slipped through the door,  careful not to cause the piece of metal to creak suddenly. The art  room had only been re-modeled earlier so now it had a cement floor to  the previous and noisy hardwood. One step, take another two I  approached the concentrating girl, careful not to startle her. As a  fellow artist I know how irritating it can be to be interrupted in  the moment.</p>
<p>Wonder what she’s working so hard on. Now I  was hovering over her shoulder, peering at the sketch of the ocean by  the shore. Wow, its actually decent…however, her shading is needs  work. There are many little tricks of the trade but it all comes from  inside, what you are feeling.</p>
<p>I hadn’t  realized fully how close I was to the taller girl and at the same  time I started to thank Kami that the light had cast my shadow behind  the both of us. It was just…I was compelled to watch over this  person. Instead of her aqua eyes being burned into my memory the  image faded and was replaced by another. The lonely portrait now  depicted Kaiya, sitting on a small stool facing her sketch. The light  bouncing through her golden strands, the shadow being cast behind her  figure. It would make a perfect portrait, I must remember to do it  someday. Perhaps for the upcoming project, Haruka probably won’t  mind, she hates to model anyway.</p>
<p>“Oh, I just can’t get  this!” Kaiya suddenly leaned back on her stool and bumped into me.  My arms immediately went to catch the figure, to prevent her from  falling backwards in shock.</p>
<p>“Uhh…” Her head was still  tilted back a bit, looking up at me upside down. What to say? I’m  sorry that I snuck up on you? Actually that’s not a bad idea, why  not tell her the truth?</p>
<p>“Ah…gomen ne. I just couldn’t  help it, I was curious to see what you were so concentrated  on.”</p>
<p>“Oh…” Kaiya gathered herself up from my arms and  stood up to face me. “Want to sit down?”</p>
<p>The gesture of  kindness really touched me, so I sat down.</p>
<p>“Arigato Kaiya  san.”</p>
<p>“No problem, I needed to stand for a bit anyway.”  She shrugged her shoulders. “So…what do you think Kaioh  san?”</p>
<p>“Michiru is fine Kaiya san.” I laughed.</p>
<p>“Ah…well,  plain Kaiya is all right with me.” She blushed slightly. “So,  Michiru, what do you think? I-I know the shading is off but I can’t  seem to get it to work.”</p>
<p>“So you noticed the shading  problem as well…that’s very good Kaiya.” Of course, this sort  of problem is actually very simple to correct.</p>
<p>“Could…you  help me?” The blond whispered.</p>
<p>Momentarily I was stunned.  She was actually asking for help.</p>
<p>“Of course, I’d be happy  to.” I gave her a smile and watched as her own grew.</p>
<p>Kaiya  brought another stool over from the corner of the room and we sat by  the canvas together. I took her drawing hand in mine and started to  show her the movements.</p>
<p>“It’s right here, so we’ll add a  few smooth strokes…” I started.</p>
<p>“Ah, and then we should  use smaller, deeper strokes here?”</p>
<p>“Hai, that’s the  way. It’s all based on what you feel.”</p>
<p>We spent the hour  working on shading and articulating the small but important details.  Time just went by so fast and we were having so much fun. Amazing  that it was this easy to make a friend. People are normally  intimidated by my status…being a famous artist and musician. I  really hope she doesn’t possess a talisman.</p>
<p>“Kaiya…”</p>
<p>“Yeah…?”</p>
<p>“Do you have  any other sketches by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Well, just two  others.” She rummaged through her bag and brought out a small,  green binder.</p>
<p>I took the object and flipped it open to  review the pictures. They all had the same style, a consistent one.  Most people spend years and years to settle into their unique style  but she…</p>
<p>“How long have you been drawing for?”</p>
<p>Her  squinted eyes opened as she turned her head from the window’s  direction.</p>
<p>“Two years.”</p>
<p>That’s amazing.</p>
<p>“Do  you ever color your artwork? It doesn’t appear like you do from  these sketches.”</p>
<p>“Well…no, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Why  if I may ask? They would look even more beautiful if colored…”</p>
<p>“I’m  not very good at coloring.” Kaiya finally replied. “I always mess  the picture up…so I’ve stopped trying.”</p>
<p>“It’s  practice…” I carefully stated. “If you want, I can give you  lessons.”</p>
<p>“Really? You mean it?” Disbelief evident in  her voice.</p>
<p>“Yeah, why not?” I was laughing, her  expressions were so cute.</p>
<p>“Yay! Arigato!”</p>
<p>Nothing  could’ve prepared me for the glomp. Without warning Kaiya jumped  from her stool and wrapped her arms around my sides sending us both  falling to the floor. Course I was surprised but I couldn’t help  but think…three times up to date! Those two blondes are really  alike.</p>
<p>“Oops, gomen ne about that, I can get a little  excited sometimes.” Kaiya got up and outstretched her hand to help  me up.</p>
<p>“It’s all right.” I managed, taking her  outstretched hand and was pulled to my feet. “What do you have next  Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Well…” She took out her schedule. “It says  music.”</p>
<p>This piqued my interest greatly.</p>
<p>“What  instrument do you play?”</p>
<p>“I…I don’t know.” She  scratched the back of her head in thought. “Like, I might know if  you show me the instrument…”</p>
<p>That’s odd, how could you  play an instrument but not know its name?</p>
<p>“I see. Well, why  don’t we go over to the music room early? Maybe you’ll recognize  it when you see it.”</p>
<p>“You mean right now?” Her eyes  widened.</p>
<p>“It should be open…unless you don’t want to.”  I turned to face her.</p>
<p>“No, let’s go.” She picked up her  sketches and her bag.</p>
<p>Together we left the room and made our  way to the music wing.</p>
<p>The music wing was much noisier than  the art wing. Many different sounds could be heard as we passed the  rowed classes. Finally coming to the end of the corridor I used my  student card and opened the door.</p>
<p>“We’re here.” I  informed my guest, allowing the girl to enter the room first.</p>
<p>“Wow,  it’s huge!” Kaiya exclaimed.</p>
<p>“It should be.” I  giggled. She looks like a little kid, reminds me of another blond.  “We get a lot of prestigious musicians from all over the world.  This room is equipped with all the up to date technology and the  finest musical instruments.”</p>
<p>For a moment I watched the  girl wander around the classroom in a curious manner.</p>
<p>“The  instruments are over here.”</p>
<p>Taking her arm I pulled her  over to instrument cases. In a specific order I opened each case and  allowed her to examine the polished pieces of metal and wood.</p>
<p>Kaiya hesitated at first but then moved closer to the rack.  Her fingers trailed over each instrument, testing each key  tentatively. I wonder what instrument she plays. She continued  forward, past the larger cases and to the smaller cases. The action  meant that it isn’t likely to be a brass type, a woodwind perhaps.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Kaiya let out a recognizing gasp.</p>
<p>She  pulled out a small, long length case.</p>
<p>“So you play the  flute?” I inquired. She looked at me blankly. “Go ahead, if you  want to test it out.”</p>
<p>I could’ve sworn her hands were  shaking slightly as she fitted the three pieces together. Her eyes  betrayed a sense of fear, was she afraid of breaking it?</p>
<p>The  three pieces were assembled together in minutes, I noticed Kaiya’s  breathing was slightly heavy but died down with relief.</p>
<p>“Try  playing it.” Truly I wanted to see what she was capable of, I  didn’t even bother trying to conceal my eagerness.</p>
<p>Kaiya  lifted the small instrument to her lips, feeling the coolness of the  metal. Her fingers pressed on the keys and tested the flexibility of  them. Closing her eyes she blew a light warm air into the mouthpiece.  All the steps were very similar to a pro, adjusting the little  things, testing the waters, and warming the instrument before use.  Seemingly satisfied the blond launched into a quick practice of the  twelve major scales by memory. First time through it was done with a  steady stream of air, the second time each note was articulated  sharply and clearly defined the notes separately.</p>
<p>When she  had stopped I felt my hands come up to clap but stopped when she  moved into a song. Her eyes opened slightly and sent shivers down my  spine. The aqua eyes in the vision, the same lonely eyes from before.  Their sadness was only paralleled by the sorrowful music the  instrument performed. Everything about it tugged at my heartstrings.  It reminds me of my own sad song on the violin.</p>
<p>When the  musician finished I was nothing less than impressed. Another thought  struck me at that moment but I needed to be sure first.</p>
<p>“Kaiya,  would you mind accompanying me in this one piece? I wrote it  myself.”</p>
<p>The blond continued to stare straight into space,  muttering mute with her lips.</p>
<p>“Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“H-Huh?”</p>
<p>“Would  you mind playing this piece with me?”</p>
<p>“Oh! I’d be happy  to.” She’s agreed. We both smiled at each other.</p>
<p>This  time it was I who was rummaging through my school bag. My hand darted  through the cluttered objects until I found a narrow note holder. It  was aqua, my favorite color of course.</p>
<p>I walked back to the  blond and handed her the sheet music to look over.</p>
<p>“This is  what it looks like.” I studied her facial features as her eyes  roamed the dotted paper.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like a flute  piece.” She finally concluded.</p>
<p>“Right, it’s for the  violin. That’s what I play.” Moving over to the rack I picked out  a curved case with my named engraved in it. “See?” I held the  instrument out for her to examine. “All I ask is try to blend  in.”</p>
<p>If she could do this then it should be no problem.</p>
<p>“Could I hear you play it once first?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t  the answer I was expecting. Not that it wasn’t an unreasonable  request but most people would jump into it and fumble through it  right there.</p>
<p>“Sure, no problem.”</p>
<p>Bringing my head  to the instrument headrest I closed my eyes similarly to Kaiya  earlier. Feeling the music is what’s important. For this test, I’ll  use my special sad song, there’s a good feeling about this. My  fingers started to move the bow with the lengthy movements across the  strings, earning a deep, mournful vibe. Soon I was lost in the music.  At times I unconsciously swayed my hips and shoulders, until I  finally finished.</p>
<p>Opening my eyes I saw Kaiya with hers  closed.</p>
<p>“Okay, I think I’m ready to try.” She finally  answered.</p>
<p>Keeping her eyes closed she raised the flute to her  lips once more. Taking in the atmosphere I started us off and she  followed.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>It’s so  sad…When I listened to it the first time I felt something stab into  my inner being. It’s similar to those chains, the pain expressed.  Now my fingers moved on their own, freeing all buried emotions. To my  surprise, I started to play my own song of sorrow and was delighted  that the two blended into each other perfectly. Almost as thought our  pain was the same but…why…?</p>
<p>My eyes remained closed but I  could see. In the darkness I saw a child, crying and huddled in a  corner.</p>
<p><em>Parents, where did you go?<br />
  Abandoning your own  creation.</em></p>
<p>She cried but no one heard her, no one  came.</p>
<p><em>Dear sister, where did you go?<br />
  Are meetings really  that important?</em></p>
<p>Where were her friends?</p>
<p><em>What  friends? They never existed.<br />
  Do we really need friends?</em></p>
<p>So  what happened?</p>
<p><em>She disappeared…</em></p>
<p>The final  note rang out throughout the room, echoing off the walls, entrapping  the magical moment for a few seconds longer. I opened my eyes and was  alarmed at the sight before me.</p>
<p>“Michiru, what’s  wrong?”</p>
<p>The aqua haired teenager was crying, shedding tears  for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>“I-I don’t know.” She looked up  at me with sad eyes. “It just happened.”</p>
<p>“Hey! What’s  happening?”</p>
<p>Kaiya and I turned to see a familiar figure at  the doorway.</p>
<p><u><br />
  Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p>“Michiru?” Haruka walked over to us. “What  did you do?” She yelled forcefully at Kaiya.</p>
<p>“Haruka,  please! She did nothing, we just played <em>that</em> piece and I  started to cry.” I tried to reassure my friend.</p>
<p>“I see…”  Haruka gave me a knowing look. “And…?”</p>
<p>“She’s  perfect.”</p>
<p>Kaiya looked at us both, looking at a lose at our  conversation.</p>
<p>“Kaiya, Haruka plays the piano.” The girl  addressed nodded her head, understanding what I had just said. “And  you already know that I play the violin.” She nodded slowly once  more. “Well, Haruka and I give concerts and we’ve been looking  for a third person. Would you be interested?”</p>
<p>“Me?  Well…Can I get back to you with that?” She replied  uncertainly.</p>
<p>“Look, if it’s because of me I’m sorry for  yelling at you earlier.” Haruka suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p>“It’s  not that…”</p>
<p><em>Briiiing.</em></p>
<p>“We could talk about  it after school.” I tried to offer.</p>
<p>The class had started  to fill with students. They all brushed by us and prepared their  instruments.</p>
<p>“I-umm…I can’t today. I promised that I’d  meet someone.”</p>
<p>“Everyone, set up quickly, let’s get  this class started!” The professor instructed.</p>
<p>By then  Kaiya had already moved into the crowd to her section. Maybe we can  reason with her later.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>Michiru  and Haruka want me to be the third person? I flipped the music page  over on my stand. I don’t know if I have the time, quite honestly I  don’t know how long I’ll be here for. What advantage could I  possibly get from this? Hmm…I flipped another page over. Concert…I  believe that means that you perform in front of large crowds, or  that’s what the textbooks’ defined them as. Lots of people…it  might help after all, Hotaru did mention once that my parents were  music lovers. However, to not sound so anxious I’ll give them my  reply tomorrow instead of today.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly and the  dismissal bell rang.</p>
<p><em>Briiiing.</em></p>
<p>As soon as the  bell had rang I zipped out of the class to the bus stop. I didn’t  really have anything better to do but I knew that I didn’t want to  hang around Haruka right now. All we do is argue, and he isn’t very  good at it either!</p>
<p>Taking the local bus I stopped at the  shrine and climbed the steps to look for Rei. To my luck she was  already home, at least I’ll have some company.</p>
<p>“Now  Kaiya, remember I told you that you’ll need to do chores and such  to stay here right?” The miko began the conversation.</p>
<p>I  nodded my head. I did agree to it and the idea didn’t really bother  me at all. It’s just another form of physics exercise or  training.</p>
<p>“Well forget it for today.”</p>
<p>“What?” I  blinked. No training?</p>
<p>“Yeah, I mean we have a lot of time  for that! Besides I want you to meet some friend’s of mine, I’m  sure you’d like them.” The girl enthusiastically talked.</p>
<p>“Uhh,  sure Rei. But what about your grandpa, wouldn’t he need some help?”  Despite the fact that he was a pervert he was still old.</p>
<p>“Nah,  he’s all right. There isn’t a lot to do today anyway and I told  him we’d be gone for the afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Mm…all right, as  long as he knows.”</p>
<p>The shorter girl wrapped her hand around  my arm and we made our way down the shrine steps. I sure didn’t  know my way around and so I allowed myself to be pulled to our  destination.<br />
  <u>Later,</u> <u>Haruka’s POV</u></p>
<p>I’ll  just wait for Michi in here. I walked into the entrance of the arcade  and looked around. Games, I loved games, especially the racing ones!  As I ventured further into the building two high pitched arguing  voices caught my attention.</p>
<p>“Come on Usagi, you can’t give  up. I need an opponent! My formula one racing career depends on it! A  long blond haired, blue eyed girl shouted at her friend.</p>
<p>The  other meatball headed blond looked absolutely floored.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t  you get a driver’s license first?” her friend replied.</p>
<p>This  was too good to be true, let’s see how this’ll go.</p>
<p>“I’ll  race you. I’ll even give you a head start.” I offered, catching  the two younger girl’s attention.</p>
<p>Heh, look at the way  they’re staring at me. No one can resist my charm. I didn’t have  to do anything this time. After the two of us were seated I kept my  word and let the little hot shot have her head start. No point in  showing off too soon.</p>
<p>I watched her progress on the screen  monitor. She was really slow…Finally, I just got bored. What the  heck.</p>
<p>“Guess I better start.”</p>
<p>Pressing on the gas  pedal I easily caught up and lapped her.</p>
<p>“No way!” She  shrieked.</p>
<p>That was cute. Now let’s see how she handles  being lapped more than once. As my car made it’s way past the  girl’s again she lost it and crashed. Darn, well it was fun while  it lasted.</p>
<p>“Haruka, I’m here.”</p>
<p>I looked up away  from the machine to see Michiru standing in the doorway. The sunlight  hit her curves perfectly. I couldn’t help but think how pretty she  was. Out of the corner of my eye the other two blondes had similar  reactions when they had first laid their eyes on me earlier.</p>
<p>“Been  waiting for you Michiru.”</p>
<p>“Gomen ne, Haruka. It took a bit  longer than expected.” She smiled pleasantly. “Were you  lonely?”</p>
<p>I chuckled.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? I had two  pretty young ladies to keep me company.”</p>
<p>The two girls  behind me made whispering noises as Michiru gave me a warning look.  It was the ‘Don’t you dare’ look. Like I’d do anything with  little girls anyway.</p>
<p>“I see you’re still at it.”</p>
<p>The  door to the arcade opened for the third time and to my annoyance it  was who I thought it was.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>“I  wasn’t doing anything Kaiya.”</p>
<p>“Rei!” The younger  blondes raced to their friend as she unhooked herself from my arm.  The three of them huddled together and started whispering like crazy,  while every so often, throwing Haruka, Michiru and I fan girl  glances. All three of us shivered.</p>
<p>“Sure I bet.” I  replied sarcastically. “Couldn’t just have Michiru, you need to  go hit on younger girls?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I mean it or  anything.” He defended.</p>
<p>“Haruka does it all the time.”:  Michiru came to his aid.</p>
<p>“That so…You’re still a  pervert.”</p>
<p>Haruka crossed his arms and gave me a pouting  glare.</p>
<p>“I can’t help it; my charm is working overtime. But  don’t worry, it’s not like you have to suffer such a fate.”</p>
<p>Was  that a challenge? I think it was.</p>
<p>“Oh, that so?” Things  started to heat up.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is. In fact, I bet you  couldn’t go through one day of school passing off as my  double.”</p>
<p>It didn’t sound too hard. Michiru watched us  both warily, knowing exactly how this was going to go.</p>
<p>“All  right, I accept. But if you lose you have to dress up as a girl for a  day.”</p>
<p>Haruka opened his mouth to retaliate but  stopped.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, too afraid of losing?” I  smirked.</p>
<p>“No way! But if you lose you have to accept being  the third person for our group.”</p>
<p>Sure, to tell the truth,  if I lost I wouldn’t really mind. I was going to agree anyway.  Haruka is the one who has anything to lose.</p>
<p>“Deal.”</p>
<p>We  both shook hands and Michiru was our witness. For tomorrow I’ll be  Haruka Tenoh. This is going to be fun, bring it  on.</p>
