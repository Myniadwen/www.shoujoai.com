The bath had been an absolutely sinful delight. The simple white shirt 
and brown skirt that Makoto had loaned her were fresh and clean. They 
smelt of mint. Oh god, she felt ogrean again. And now she was sited to a 
generously loaded table with Donkey Pelt (who was - Alleluia! - also 
clean, although the pelt seemed even more ruffled than before), Ami and 
Makoto.

The ogress, the dwarf and the giant were blinking in disbelief when the 
human began to literally ravage the dishes. It was like watching a 
tornado destroy a land. It was like watching a black hole swallowing a 
galaxy, in accelerated motion, of course. They instinctively inched away 
from the girl, in fear of being mistaken for the food.

Michiru turned to Ami. &#147;So, I hope you don&#146;t mind my asking, but how 
come that a dwarf lives so far from her people and where there&#146;s no gold 
mine no less?&#148;

A sad smile appeared on the blue-haired girl. Makoto wrapped an arm 
around her delicate figure and squeezed her reassuringly. Stormy green 
eyes pinned down apologetic ones. Ami reached out and hugged the giant 
back. &#147;This is alright Mako, I shouldn&#146;t be so sensitive.&#148; Makoto was 
about to protest when Ami covered her mouth with a hand, tenderly 
silencing her.

She turned back to their guests. &#147;You have maybe noticed that I am not 
exactly the most common specimen of the dwarfish specie. Dwarves are 
naturally inclined to science, they are usually more attracted to 
engineering, physics and geology. I am no exception, but what really 
interested me was medicine, chemistry and, well, letters, which is quite 
unusual in our society. The fact that I mastered all of these 
disciplines made up for it, though. And a doctor always comes in handy 
in a mine.&#148; She took a shaky breath. &#147;However, what really made an 
outcast of me were my frail constitution... And the fact that I don&#146;t 
have any facial hair.&#148; She finished in a tiny voice.

Michiru was shocked to hear this. There was someone else who had 
suffered a similar fate as hers.

&#147;Nuuh? Shoaunds likre Miglifu!!! Acckkk!!!&#148; Exclaimed Donkey Pelt before 
choking on a piece of bread.

The ogress patted her on the back, maybe a bit more strongly than 
necessary, until the piece of bread shot out of her mouth and landed 
somewhere in the crowd. Someone yelled. Someone else yelled back. Soon 
sounds of fights were heard and Makoto had to go settle the situation, 
which she did by using one of the brawlers to knock the other down. In 
no time she was back, her arm wrapped protectively around Ami as if 
nothing had happened.

Ami was curious now. &#147;Were you kept apart because you didn&#146;t have any 
facial hair too?&#148;

&#147;Hum... Ami dear, I don&#146;t think that&#146;s what she meant. Having facial 
hair is not very common among female ogres or humans...&#148; Interjected the 
tall brunette.

The dwarf frowned. &#147;But many human women in this village do have a 
moustache, some even have a beard...&#148;

&#147;Err...&#148;

Michiru quickly came to rescue the giant. &#147;Actually, it is more because 
I&#146;m what you could call a neat freak, that and I love arts. My greatest 
wish is to become a renowned violin player.&#148; Her eyes were downcast when 
she added. &#147;It is absolutely unacceptable for an ogress to behave like 
that and I have been banned. And all the other species are afraid of 
ogres...&#148;

The three other women didn&#146;t miss the sheer loneliness in her voice and 
offered her comforting smiles.

Ami patted her hand. &#147;I used to feel like you do. I thought that because 
of my difference I would be alone all my life. I used to think that 
nobody could love me, that I was an error. Until I met Makoto. She told 
me I was beautiful. She told me she loved me, and more importantly, she 
made me understand that I deserve happiness too.&#148;

A collective &#147;Awww...&#148; came from the crowd.

Blushing, she continued. &#147;I am certain that there is someone for you out 
there!&#148;

&#147;Yeah! Love is blind!&#148; Donkey Pelt enthusiastically supplied.

The others face-planted. When Makoto finally recovered, she added. &#147;And 
in the meantime, I would be honoured to be counted as a friend of yours. 
Hey, you could even come and play violin here...&#148; She extended her hand.

Michiru stared at it a long time, taken aback. Then her face blossomed 
in a beautiful smile. She took the hand with her own, a tear rolling 
down her cheek. &#147;You don&#146;t know how happy it makes me.&#148; She said softly.

The two others solemnly joined their own hands to Michiru&#146;s and 
Makoto&#146;s.

Another collective sigh was heard. An over muscled barbarian warrior 
even shed a tear.

&#147;Sissy!&#148; Someone spat.

&#147;Who said that?&#148; Bellowed the barbarian.

&#147;I told you it would happen if you dressed like that!&#148; A fully armoured 
knight beside him added, sounding annoyed. &#147;Really, leather strings are 
so clich&eacute;!&#148;

&#147;But... But it&#146;s traditional! And you weren&#146;t complaining yesterday 
night!&#148; His lower lip was trembling.

&#147;Oh, look! The big barbarian&#146;s going to cry!&#148; The same voice than before 
said.

&#147;BARBARIANS DON&#146;T CRY!!!&#148; And with that, he went berserk and head-butted 
the first patron under his reach, starting the equally very traditional 
brawl in a tavern.

Soon enough, the tavern was a furious battlefield. Fists, elbows and 
knees connected with temples, eyes, jaws, solar plexus and family 
jewels. If they weren&#146;t already flying by themselves, teeth, or fangs 
sometimes, sank in calves or throats. People were sent crashing on 
chairs and tables. Chairs and tables were sent crashing on people.

In the confusion, the women got separated. Michiru had seen Donkey Pelt 
crawling away, hopefully she had found some shelter. She had also had 
the time to see Makoto beating to a pulp a brawler who had stupidly 
attacked Ami before they disappeared out of her sight. She herself had 
no difficulty to dispose of her few aggressors. Being an ogress had its 
advantages. But she was getting quite pissed. Luckily, the fight was 
coming to an end.

&#147;LOOK OUT!&#148; A voice near her suddenly shouted.

She looked around her curiously. Finding nothing, she finally looked up 
to find that the large, heavy wooden wheel that stood as a chandelier 
was about to fall, and that she was just under it.

Before she knew what happened, something collided with her with enough 
momentum to throw her safely out of the way just as the chandelier 
crashed down, making the whole inn shake and creating a large cloud of 
dust.

When she opened her eyes, it was to meet the two most beautiful blue 
orbs she had ever seen (A.N: Now, it would improve the storytelling a 
lot if you could listen to &#145;Blue Eyes&#146; by Elton John while you&#146;re 
reading. Or at least imagine it, you know, &#145;Blue eyes... Baby&#146;s got blue 
eeyyees....&#146; Thank you.). She also realized that she was tightly cradled 
in strong arms. She liked this feeling a lot.

&#147;Are you alright?&#148; A sensual voice purred, sending chills along her 
spine.

It took the ogress a moment to realize that the question was addressed 
to her and that the voice was owned by the same person who was still 
holding her. &#147;Yes, yes, thank you, I&#146;m fine...&#148; She cursed herself when 
the person let her go and took a step back. But now, that she wasn&#146;t so 
close, she could take a good look at this person. The first word that 
sprang to her mind was &#145;Handsome&#146;. The second and third, after a split 
second, were &#145;Giant cat?&#146;. The giant cat in question was standing on its 
two hinder legs, like a humanoid. Like that, it was maybe taller than 
Makoto herself and had a beautiful sandy fur. It wore a stylish black 
hat with a fluffy white feather pinned in, a black cape, an immaculate 
white shirt, black gloves, black pants and black leather boots. A large 
black leather band with a buckle ran from its right shoulder to its left 
hip where a duellist sword was comfortably hanging.

Michiru quickly averted her gaze when she realized she was ogling this 
stranger like a five years old would ogle an ice-cream.

&#147;I&#146;m glad...&#148; The giant cat purred again, sounding amused. &#147;It would be 
a shame if such a gorgeous ogress was hurt.&#148; The statement was 
accompanied by an utterly devastating grin.

Michiru felt her knees go week. &#145;Gorgeous?&#146; Her brain literally melted. 
She stuttered. &#147;Yes... I mean, no... I mean, it wouldn&#146;t have done me 
much harm, being an ogress and all...&#148; She doubly cursed herself. &#145;Oh, 
smooth, Michiru! Really smooth! You dolt!!!&#146;

A gloved hand reached out and lightly stroke one of her furiously 
blushing cheeks. &#147;Then I&#146;m glad I didn&#146;t know...&#148;

Before she could reply, she heard Ami, Makoto and Donkey Pelt call her 
worriedly. She turned around to wave them over. &#147;I&#146;m here! I&#146;m fine, 
thanks to this gentleman...&#148;

&#147;Who?&#148; They asked, looking in the general direction where Michiru was 
pointing.

She span around.

Gone...

A.N: You can stop the music now. So, like it? Don&#146;t like it? Please, 
tell me!!!
