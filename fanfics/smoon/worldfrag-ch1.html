<pre>Pieces of a normal life 

Cold wind played with the white curtains as she packed the few things 
her girlfriend brought for her during the past days: Books, her 
walkman and her teddy bear. And fresh clothes.

Her hands froze in motion and dark green eyes stared for a long time 
at the blue jeans that still laid on her bed. The cloth was washed 
now. Nothing remembered of the blood that had covered it.

Only some, only a few days ago...

Haruka sighed oppressed as she threw it into the dustbin. She was sure 
that she would never be able to wear it again.

***

It was still cloudy outside and fresh wind moved the naked branches of 
the grey trees around them. The grass was frozen and cracked when they 
walked above it. But the sun finally found a hole in the thick blanket 
of dark clouds and it&#39;s light shone peacefully at the sleeping earth 
underneath. It brought a little bit warmth with it. It&#39;s rays touched 
three smiling faces, was reflected in three pairs of sparkling eyes. 
It brought a little bit warmth with it. And a little bit of hope.

&quot;I wanna walk onma own!&quot; demanded a high child&#39;s voice and two lower 
voices laughed as a small girl ran with uncertain steps over the wide 
meadow. Winter birds flew through the air, dark spots against a grey 
sky. They screamed loudly in the peaceful silence. Nothing was heard 
but the rushes of the near sea and time by time the engine of a car 
driving away from the park of Tokyo city. The green oasis as the 
people called it - in summer.

&quot;Be careful, princess.&quot; Two strong hands hold the tiny arms of the 
small girl who squeaked for joy. A happy smile laid on her face and 
only if you looked closer you could see pale scars on the now redden 
cheeks. She wore thick trousers and a dark blue jacket. A white cap 
covered her dark hairs and her almost black eyes looked loving up at 
her parents.

&quot;Aim strong!&quot; declared the little girl and grabbed faithfully the 
reaching hands.

&quot;Hai, you are, my princess.&quot; Declared Haruka and gave her daughter a 
kiss on the forehead. Then she let her go and Hotaru run again some 
steps. Very proud about herself.

You&#39;re strong. And you grow stronger. With every smile. With every 
laugh. With every day you enjoy your life on this earth.

Haruka watched her daughter walk and was near her for the case that 
the little girl would loose her balance. To hold her for the case that 
Hotaru would fall.

I am happy for you, princess. But at the same time I envy your 
innocence...

&quot;She&#39;s a wild tomboy.&quot; Laughed Michiru and stepped at the other side 
of her daughter. So that four arms would hold her. Her whole life. 
Every time Hotaru would need them, her parents would be there. There 
was nothing to be afraid of.  &quot;Just like her mother.&quot;

Haruka didn&#39;t respond anything. She simply watched her daughter and 
knew that her lover smiled at them both. 

I am not wild anymore.

&quot;I still feel guilty.&quot; Said the young violinist after a while they 
supported Hotaru and stroke some strands of her long sea green hairs 
behind her ears. &quot;You left the hospital just yesterday. I can&#39;t go on 
tour tomorrow! The whole house&#39;s a mess I didn&#39;t even tidy up the 
kitchen!&quot; Michiru sighed deeply and her long white robe wiped as she 
followed the still running Hotaru.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Michi-chan. I can tidy up the house.&quot; Dark green eyes 
looked for some moments directly into deep blue ones.

She didn&#39;t have to time to tidy anything up. Because she was almost 
the whole time in hospital. During the past days she was there to 
cheer up Himme-chan and to be there for me. 

Haruka told her about the battle. About what happened at that day 
almost one week ago. About almost everything.

&quot;That&#39;s what makes me worry even more.&quot; Laughed Michiru but her 
expression was still very serious.

&quot;Hey, hey!&quot; Haruka tried to look angry at her but the sparkling in her 
deep green eyes betrayed her. &quot;I am not so untidy as you may think. 
Well... guess, you&#39;re right.&quot; She left for some seconds the side of 
her daughter and embraced the smaller senshi softly from behind. Now 
they were looking at running Hotaru, Haruka&#39;s right cheek softly 
touched Michiru&#39;s left one.

&quot;The beneficial concerts are very important, Michi-chan. I also would 
like to go out with you the next two weeks, go to the cinema or simply 
to the park like we do right now. Hey, I&#39;d do anything but tidy up our 
house. But look at Himme-chan. She&#39;s very lucky. Because with Sailor 
Moon&#39;s help she got a new life. A life where she&#39;s not ill and not 
weak. Where she&#39;s wild and free. But many children aren&#39;t Michi-chan. 
Maybe your concerts are only a drop on the hot stone, but if you can 
help only one of those children to become healthy and strong again, 
it&#39;s worth it.&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice got shakier and she bit on her lower 
lip. Then she squeezed her lover tighter.

I need you more than I ever had.

The senshi of the wind closed her eyes and felt how soft hands were 
wrapped around her own icy ones.

But those children need you, too.

&quot;After all I&#39;ve got Hotaru to tidy up the house, too.&quot; Said Haruka 
after a long while they both listened to the happy laughter of their 
daughter, to the rushes of the leaves around and to the screaming of 
the winter birds above. Now the young racer&#39;s voice was strong again. 
And cheeky.

&quot;You convinced me, Ruka.&quot; Michiru giggled as Hotaru discovered a black 
bird on the sky and tried to follow it.

Her steps were still unsure and it looked very funny when the two year 
old girl ran. &quot;Although I still have the feeling that I should buy a 
new house when I&#39;ll return. With you two as housewives...&quot; She giggled 
as Haruka took a deep breathe.

&quot;I won&#39;t wear an apron! Forget it! And I won&#39;t cook a welcome dinner 
for you when you&#39;re returning home. As long as you don&#39;t want to be 
poisoned!&quot;

Michiru giggled even more and turned around to give her lover a tender 
kiss. It lasted for a very long time and Haruka automatically squeezed 
her Michiru harder as if she never wanted her to let go.

How shall I overcome the next terrible weeks?

The past nights in hospital were hell and she wondered if she would 
ever find sleep again in her life. Real sleep. Without nightmares 
waking her up in the middle of the night.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back in two weeks, I promise.&quot; Said Michiru after they parted 
partly with a very serious expression on her face. She wanted to say 
something more as they heard the friendly voices next to the wide 
meadow.

&quot;Look, darling. That&#39;s a nice little girl. She&#39;s so cute!&quot; An old 
woman grabbed her husband&#39;s arm and pointed over to Hotaru who still 
tried to catch the raven that was several meters above. Her shoulder 
long hairs were messed and she stretched her arms to the clouds.

&quot;Konnichi wa! How&#39;s her name?&quot; asked the old woman and smiled friendly 
at the couple. Haruka let go of Michiru and smiled back.

&quot;Konnichi wa. Her name&#39;s Hotaru.&quot; Answered Michiru and bowed slightly.

The old man winked at the little girl and Hotaru stopped in her 
haunting. Surprised she looked at the huge man who was almost as huge 
as her daddy. He smiled friendly and Hotaru looked at him with her big 
dark eyes.

&quot;Hotaru. That means little glow-worm.&quot; The old lady watched how Haruka 
came over and took her still surprised daughter in her strong arms. 
&quot;You must be very proud parents.&quot;

&quot;We are.&quot; Michiru looked at her lover and her daughter and nodded. 
Then the old couple said goodbye and turned away to take another way 
for their journey through the park.

Hai, we are.

Haruka gave her daughter a loving kiss on the redden cheeks and Hotaru 
laughed high. She spread her arms and laughed even more as the senshi 
of the wind rose her into the air.

&quot;And now we see our great pilot Hotaru flying through the air!&quot; said 
Haruka loudly and Hotaru squeaked loudly as her daddy swirled around 
with her. Her dark eyes were full of happiness.

&quot;Mo, daddy!&quot; she demanded but Haruka simply took her into her arms and 
squeezed her lovingly.

Hai, I am very proud of her.

Haruka smiled sadly at the future senshi of death, then she danced 
again with the little girl around the meadow.

The high laughter filled the air, the whole park.

Michiru watched them and again she felt that they were a real family. 
One day after they adopted Hotaru from the recent Dr. Tomoe she got 
that feeling for the first time. And she enjoyed it. Her parents died 
when she was young and Haruka and Hotaru were the first people she 
loved so unconditionally.

Only two weeks, then I&#39;ll be here again.

Normally Michiru took them with her on tour, but Haruka had some more 
races to do to finish - and certainly to win - this year&#39;s Grand Prix 
of Japan. And even if the battle had been some days ago and Hotaru was 
wild and energetically again they both decided that it was better for 
her to rest in Tokyo.

I hate it to leave them behind.

But Haruka knew that Michiru would never ever hide in her own world, 
leaving her family behind.

&quot;Look, mommy. I fly!&quot; screamed Hotaru and clapped in her hands. The 
sun shone from heaven through a tiny hole between the heavy clouds and 
it&#39;s rays surrounded the tiny body Haruka hold tight in her strong 
arms.

Happy dark eyes meet loving green ones. Haruka swallowed hard before 
she put the little girl on the grass again, took Michiru&#39;s right hand 
and left together with her family the meadow. Still looking at her 
daughter

She&#39;s worth every pain.

***

The bend came nearer and nearer. Haruka knew that she was too fast for 
it. That she would crash into the white wall near the road. That she 
wouldn&#39;t survive the accident. That she would die.

That my nightmares are over - at last.

At that moment she saw the familiar faces between yelling fans.

That I would leave them behind...

The bend came and automatically Haruka slowed her car down and passed 
it living.

Passed the finish line as the winner - with tears burning in her eyes.

***

&quot;You&#39;re lucky that it doesn&#39;t rain.&quot; Sceptically Ami looked up at the 
grey sky and counted the umbrella Mamoru was wearing. They all 
declared that it wouldn&#39;t rain. Even the meteorologist declared that 
it would become a cloudy, cool but nice day. But Ami didn&#39;t believe 
them.

&quot;Hai, because I&#39;ve ordered such a nice weather.&quot; A girl with two 
blonde plaits passed her and looked curiously around.

&quot;You&#39;re such a baka. When you ordered the weather, why didn&#39;t you 
chose sunshine? And a hot temperature. Then we could go to the sea 
swimming!&quot; declared Rei and Minako giggled as the two were running 
down the parking space. Hunting each other. Long blonde and black 
hairs swirled in the wind and Usagi&#39;s screams could be heard over the 
whole place.

&quot;I wonder where they are.&quot; Mamoru frowned and put the umbrellas down 
to take a look at his watch. It was ten minutes past three in the 
afternoon. They wanted to meet at three and normally the person they 
were waiting for was even earlier than they.

&quot;I guess she thought that we wouldn&#39;t come before half past three.

Because Usako can be very lazy and very slow when she tries to make 
her hairs.&quot; Declared a tall girl with long brown hairs next to him. 
She hold a big basket in her arms and hoped that the other would like 
the picnic she prepared at home.

Mamoru who still watched his girlfriend being haunted by the young 
priest giggled as he heard Makoto&#39;s words. But he was wise enough to 
respond nothing. Usagi often heard the words she shouldn&#39;t hear and 
didn&#39;t hear the words that were important for her. She was sometimes 
really clumsy but the tall man loved the girl very much. Not only 
because he knew that she would be his future Queen. He loved her for 
the person she was: Understanding, loving, caring,  concerned about 
the ones she loved. Always helpful. She would never turn her back to a 
friend and they all knew that she would fight for them. That she would 
walk through hell as long as there was still a ray of hope.

That&#39;s why she was able to rescue Hotaru. And to give Haruka and 
Michiru a second chance after the appearance of the talismans.

Maybe Usagi was sometimes clumsy, maybe she cried a lot and maybe she 
could behave childish, she was the best friend they all could imagine.

&quot;Hope they didn&#39;t have an accident.&quot; Ami&#39;s voice was really concerned 
as she stepped next to Mamoru. Her blue eyes watched the street next 
to the parking space concentrated behind her glasses. Wind played with 
the strands of her shoulder long blue hair but she didn&#39;t even 
mentioned it.

&quot;Haruka and an accident? She&#39;s a formula one racer.&quot; Laughed Makoto 
and went over to free Usagi from a raging Rei. Often they had their 
tiny battles and they both seemed to enjoy it, but Makoto didn&#39;t want 
to be ashamed for them - especially when they dirtied their clothes 
and looked like two little children. Although they would pay less when 
they would be little children.

Makoto smiled, then she stepped determined between the still arguing 
girls.

&quot;Stop it, now!&quot; was all she had to say to see in two guilty shinning 
pairs of eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ve already seen a horse! There, next to the entrance!&quot; A high voice 
interrupted the sudden silence of the parking space and a girl of 
maybe ten years run over the asphalt. High trees surrounded the 
parking space and two plaids of pink hairs looked strange in all the 
grey the cold world offered them. It was November now and it would be 
another long way until nature would green again. But the sunshine 
didn&#39;t disappear so easily. At last not very easy when the girl smiled 
happily at her future daddy. &quot;And two pigs grunted over there and...&quot; 
exited Chibiusa told Mamoru what she had already seen. The tall man 
went on his knees to order the scarf that protected her neck and to 
close the bottoms of her white jacket. It was almost the same style 
her future mother wore.

&quot;I am very curious if the pigs look like Usako.&quot; Declared Chibiusa and 
showed the future Queen of Crystal Tokyo her tongue. Usagi blushed and 
took an angry breathe.

&quot;You...!&quot;

Four inner senshi looked tortured at the grey sky and waited for 
another argument to broke out. But instead of loud, angry words they 
heard the breaks of a car. They all turned their heads and saw how a 
the senshi of the wind climbed out of the car. She bowed to help her 
daughter out of the child&#39;s seat. Hotaru laughed happily as she saw 
her aunts and her uncle and tried to run over to Chibiusa. But Haruka 
hold her back and corrected her white cap. She didn&#39;t want her 
daughter to become ill.

&quot;Now you&#39;re ready.&quot; She declared with a silent voice and observed how 
the future senshi of death run over to her best friend. Chibiusa 
forgot about her argument with Usagi and took the little girl in her 
arms and swirled around with her. Hotaru laughed and dark eyes looked 
trustfully into loving pink ones.

&quot;Gomen, I am too late, but I simply couldn&#39;t find the key.&quot; Declared 
Haruka as she rose from her kneeling position and locked the silver 
Ferrari. Then she slowly came over to the rest of the Sailor Team. 
&quot;Hotaru had hide it and thought it was very funny to see me searching 
for it.&quot; She smiled a tired smile and Ami automatically frowned. She 
had never seen the strongest of all senshi ever weak. Not even during 
the final fight against Mistress 9.

Guess she&#39;s simply missing her Michiru.

But at the same time the senshi of water was unsure. Michiru went more 
than once on tour and Haruka had never been as pale as she was today.

Maybe she&#39;s getting a flu? She&#39;s always so careless.

Ami looked at the open dark jacket of the young car racer and saw that 
Haruka wore a black jeans and a black pullover. And she asked herself 
when the senshi of wind changed her fashion. Normally she liked bright 
colours. Yellow was her favourite colour. Now she could be overseen in 
the grey nature that surrounded her.

&quot;Where&#39;s Setsuna? She didn&#39;t answer the phone.&quot; Haruka searched in her 
jacket for money and was glad that she didn&#39;t forget it on the table.

As I forgot a lot during the past weeks.

Michiru was on tour for ten days now. Only four more days and she 
would return. But Haruka wasn&#39;t sure if she should be happy or scared 
about it. Because when she was alone she could live with her ghosts. 
With her personal fears. The others didn&#39;t see them because she didn&#39;t 
let them mentioned that she wasn&#39;t feeling fine. That she didn&#39;t get 
enough sleep. That she spend most of the night kneeling at the ground 
of her shower. But Michiru would mention it. Sooner than later. She 
knows me too well.

&quot;She&#39;s still at work. She wants to follow when she&#39;s allowed to go at 
five. &quot; answered Mamoru and took all the umbrellas again in his hand. 
As Haruka frowned he only shook his head and pointed over to Ami. 
Slightly the senshi of wind replied her future King&#39;s smile.

&quot;Then let&#39;s go into the zoo!!!&quot; screamed Chibiusa and run back to the 
entrance. She had to run very slowly because Hotaru&#39;s legs were 
shorter than her ones but Chibiusa would have preferred to crawl than 
to let go of the warm hand that laid trustfully in her own one.

&quot;Zoo?&quot; The future senshi of death laid her head into her neck and 
looked up at the table near the entrance. It showed different animals 
between green trees. &quot;Mongy.&quot; She laughed and pointed at the brown 
animal. Chibiusa only smiled. She didn&#39;t corrected her best friend 
that the animal was called monkey. The future senshi was still too 
small to pronounce it the right way.

&quot;And it&#39;s not very expensive.&quot; Said Ami after she studied the prices. 
She corrected her glasses and looked up as Haruka bowed to pick up 
some coins.

&quot;It&#39;s almost winter. Most of the animals do their winter sleep and 
it&#39;s simply too cold for most of the people.&quot; Answered Makoto and 
thanked Rei who helped her with the heavy basket.

&quot;Do you want to feed an whole army?&quot; asked the young priest and 
giggled as they exchanged glances. &quot;Hai, you&#39;re right. Usako is indeed 
an army when she eats.&quot; Again she giggled as she saw the blondes angry 
look that suddenly changed into sadness as the senshi of the moon 
looked into her money bag. The she blushed.

&quot;Gomen, Mamo-chan, but...&quot; she declared but was interrupted by Rei who 
rolled her eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me that you spend your whole pocket money for that manga 
yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Hai...&quot; Usagi&#39;s eyes watered and everyone knew that she would cry 
within the next minutes. &quot;But it was such a good manga and I...&quot; Now 
she started to cry and Mamoru gave her a handkerchief.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Usagi. I&#39;ll pay.&quot; Said Haruka without looking up from 
the money in her trembling hands. &quot;Be my guests.&quot; A tomboy smile 
appeared on her pale face as she went to the counter and talked 
friendly to the young woman standing behind a dirty window.

&#147;You&#146;re my best friend.&#148; Declared Usagi and embraced the tall woman 
from behind. She frowned, but only for a second, as Haruka winced away 
quickly.

&#147;You told me I was your best friend when I bought you yesterday an ice 
cream.&#148; Complained Rei and another argument started.

Haruka freed herself from Usagi&#146;s arms and gave the service girl the 
money. She smiled as she handled the young car racer the entrance 
cards and two caps for the children and wished them a nice day.

&quot;What the...&quot; Mamoru looked at the caps in Haruka&#39;s hands and burst 
out into wild laughter. The caps were grey with two big elephant ears 
on each side. The two girls wore it with pride. And after they talked 
friendly to the service girl again, Usako got such a nice cap, too. 
Her one with blue with a long fish tail that looked like a third 
plaid.

&quot;You look so silly!&quot; Rei showed Usagi her tongue.

&quot;You&#39;re only jealous!&quot; The girl showed the priest her tongue back.

Then they entered the zoo and exited they saw all the animals that 
weren&#39;t in winter sleep now. Monkeys screamed and Makoto laughed 
loudly as she gave them some of the bananas she carried on her great 
basket. Usagi, who was already hungry, got a banana, too and shared it 
with Rei, who jumped around her, waving her arms and behaving like a 
crazy monkey. Chibiusa was very exited when she was allowed to stroke 
a pony and Hotaru hold up bravely a piece of sugar the little horse 
ate with passion. Mamoru liked the flamingos and Ami loved it to watch 
the fishes in the huge aquarium.

It looks like the sea...

Haruka stood in front of it her thoughts drifted away with the silent, 
beautiful animals. What is Michi-chan doing right now?

She sighed deeply and felt a warm hand placed on her right shoulder. 
As she looked up she saw in two understanding blue eyes.

&quot;We all miss her. But the concerts are over in four days and Hotaru 
enjoys this visit to the zoo.&quot; Declared Ami seriously and smiled up at 
the senshi of the wind. Haruka only nodded back. Unable to smile. 
Unable to move.

After some more minutes they went over to see the tigers and the 
lions. Usagi was very exited and screamed as one tiger roared loudly 
and the rest of the senshi burst out into laughter.

So the hours flew by and suddenly it was dawn. And time for dinner.

&quot;And I thought I&#39;d have to carry it for the rest of my life.&quot; Groaned 
Rei while they looked at a big sign that stood in the middle of the 
zoo and showed them where to go best to eat the delicious meal Makoto 
had prepared for all of them.  Especially Usagi, who declared an hour 
ago that she was hungry, pointed exited at different houses and 
pavilions that were very good in the summer and maybe the same good 
when Rei heated them up with her fire. 

&#147;And I can&#146;t wait to eat your chicken.&#148; Declared Usagi and smiled 
greedy more at the basket than at Makoto.

She didn&#146;t see the shadows coming from behind. Nor did the others.

&#147;How could you guess that it&#146;s chicken?&#148; wanted Rei to ask and her 
dark eyes sparkled, because she loved chicken, too. With a good bread 
and a lot of cheese. 

&#147;Because I can smell it.&#148; Answered Usagi and Chibiusa left for the 
first time Hotaru&#146;s side to risk a look into the bask.

&#147;Yap.&#148; She commented. &#147;It&#146;s chicken. I hope it&#146;s enough for all of us 
when Usagi likes it that much.&#148; Chibiusa looked innocently up at 
Makoto and the other senshi burst out into laughter. Only Haruka 
watched them in silence. But a thin smile appeared on her face as she 
saw how Usagi tried to catch a laughing Rei who joked about her.

I am very glad that they are my friends.

Haruka sighed deeply and leaned herself against the big sign.

I am very glad that they don&#146;t know about it.

&#147;Hey, you beauties! What are you doing so lonely at this late hour?&#148; 
asked suddenly a deep voice loudly and two shadows stepped out of the 
dark. They were two man at the thirty and they reeled slightly. 
Haruka&#146;s mouth was nothing more than a line as she recognized that 
they both were drunken. Determined they walked over to Ami and a book 
fell down on the ground as one of the men grabbed her rudely.

&#147;Leave her in peace!&#148; whispered Haruka and left her place. 
Protectively she stepped before Hotaru and clenched her fists. &#147;Just 
leave us alone!&#148; She wanted to them to go. To beat them down. To free 
Ami. To kick them until they felt the pain she got to know too well 
during the past weeks.

But she couldn&#146;t. For the first time in her whole life she couldn&#146;t 
move. She just stood there, like a protecting wall between the rude 
men and her daughter. Maybe she wasn&#146;t able to defend the others 
anymore. And certainly she wasn&#146;t able to defend herself anymore. But 
surely she was still able to defend Hotaru.

Even if they have to kill me!

Haruka swallowed hard and watched how Usagi took her Chibiusa in her 
arms and Mamoru walked determined over to the two men. Rei and Makoto 
followed her.

They don&#146;t have to kill me. Some other already did it...

The senshi of the wind watched how Rei and Makoto freed Ami and how 
Mamoru stepped protectively between the rude men and the girls.

&#147;Didn&#146;t you hear what that lady said?&#148; asked Mamoru in a dangerous 
quiet voice and Haruka knew with a sudden why he was going to be the 
future King of Crystal Tokyo. Why Usagi loved him so much and why 
Chibiusa adored him.

And why we all trust him. Even if it would cost our lives.

&#147;Lady? That&#146;s a lady? I thought it&#146;s a man!&#148; laughed one of the man 
rude and pointed at Haruka. The senshi of the wind didn&#146;t react. She 
only glanced back at him, feeling Hotaru who grabbed her right leg and 
hold it tight. Her big dark eyes were full of fear and tears.

&#147;Go! Immediately!&#148; Mamoru clenched his fists and showed them to the 
men to make sure that it wasn&#146;t an empty threat. Makoto and Rei 
stepped next to him. Ready to throw not only roses, but also 
lightening and fire at them.

The men looked at each other, then they heard another voice from the 
darkness of the evening:

&#147;Do what he told you or you&#146;ll regret it!&#148; Silently the men decided 
that it was better to go. They opened another beer bottle, drank a bit 
gulp and waved at the girls.

&#147;Bye, you sweetheart.&#148; One man winked at Haruka but kept silent when 
he saw Mamoru&#146;s warning look. The young man looked really frightening 
and suddenly the rude man didn&#146;t want to know how much his fists could 
hurt.

So they turned around and left the zoo.

Ami took a relieved breathe and Mamoru went over to embrace his future 
wife and his future daughter.

&#147;Everything&#146;s okay.&#148; He declared to them.

&#147;Looks as if I came right in time.&#148; Said Setsuna and stepped out of 
the shadow. She frowned as she saw how a very pale Haruka took her 
daughter in her arms and rocked her gently. But the senshi of wind 
couldn&#146;t define who comforted whom.

It&#146;s the first time that she didn&#146;t shout at guys like them. That she 
didn&#146;t beat them down. That the rest of the Sailor Team doesn&#146;t has to 
hinder her to kill an enemy.

&#147;Everything alright?&#148; asked the oldest of the senshi and stepped 
closer to Haruka. But she couldn&#146;t see into her eyes because the young 
car racer turned away from her and went over to the sign again.

&#147;Hai.&#148;

Nothing&#146;s alright. But she can&#146;t change time, although she&#146;s it&#146;s 
senshi.

&#147;What about the chicken, Usako?&#148; she asked and ignored the nausea 
increasing in her belly. The memories were too fresh. She couldn&#146;t 
simply put them away. &#147;I thought you were hungry?&#148; Her voice was 
teasing, but her whole body trembled. Hotaru grabbed her neck and 
looked with still big eyes at her papa. A thin smile appeared on her 
now pale face as Haruka lowered her head and whispered something nice 
in her ears. Kissed her cheeks softly. Embraced her tighter.

At the moment nothing&#146;s alright. But time heals all wounds. I just 
have to be patient and maybe one day I&#146;ll be strong enough again to 
beat them down. To dispel them.

&#147;Hai.&#148; Usagi blushed as Rei took a deep breathe. But soon they all 
forgot about the rude men and looked for a nice place to make their 
dinner. They all laughed, ate and talked for a very long time. It was 
a wonderful evening and Chibiusa played with lucky shinning pink eyes 
with her best friend Hotaru. They were very exited about the festival 
that would take part in some weeks at Chibiusa&#146;s school. And they 
talked about a new boy group the girls liked very much and Mamoru 
didn&#146;t even know. So they declared him every single detail about the 
three cute boys. Of course Usagi declared that she only loved her 
Mamo-chan but the rest of the team laughed when she declared that she 
liked the songs very much. And the dancing of the boys, of course.

None of them mentioned that Haruka didn&#146;t eat anything at all.

And none of them mentioned that she kept silent.

***

She stood in silence. In darkness. The moon shone through the open 
window and glass sparkled in it&#146;s dimmed light. Haruka watched the 
framed picture in her trembling hands. It showed her how she embraced 
her lover from behind. Michiru was holding a laughing baby in her arms 
&#150; little Hotaru when she had been only half a year old.

We look like real family.

Haruka sighed deeply. Wind played with her messed blonde hairs, with 
her sweaty pyjama. It made her shiver but she couldn&#146;t move to close 
the window.

I laugh so happily.

The young car racer stared blind at the picture, looking through it, 
glancing into nothing.

Will I ever be that happy again?

It cracked as glass hit the ground and smashed.

***

Soft music filled the air, surrounded the audience and let the 
musician almost float over the wide stage. She wore a long, narrow 
evening dress. It sparkled blue in the stage&#146;s lights. Her long sea 
green hairs covered her back. Soft wind played with some strands but 
she didn&#146;t even mentioned it. A smile laid on her beautiful face. Her 
eyes were closed. She danced over the wide stage, barefoot. All she 
mentioned was the violin on her shoulder and the music that evolved 
from the bow touching the strings.

It was a soft, sensitive song. Michiru got the honour to finish the 
beneficial concert with a last song and she decided for a love song 
she once wrote for her Ruka. When Dr. Tomoe died and Haruka declared 
her that she wanted to adopt Himme-chan. Of course the senshi of the 
wind never declared that she hated the small girl. Nor did she ever 
say that she didn&#146;t want to have children. But Michiru had been 
surprised as Haruka said openly that she loved their little princess 
and that she wanted the young violinist and her to be her parents &#150; 
forever.

Hai, she&#146;s the best daddy I can imagine.

Michiru smiled and remembered a black haired girl running down the 
light corridors of the house by the sea. Waking them up early at 
Sunday morning. Creeping under the warm blankets and laying down 
between her parents to sleep for another hour. Knowing that she was 
loved. That she was safe and secure. That she had a place she could 
return &#150; every time. Whatever happened.

Hai, Hotaru&#146;s the best child I can imagine.

Michiru smile grew wider.

And I am the proudest mother one can imagine.

&#147;NO!&#148;

She heard the scream. It wasn&#146;t very loud and for some seconds she 
thought she had imagined it. But there it was again. This time a 
little bit louder. A little bit more intensive. A little bit more 
real. Michiru turned her head and opened her eyes. And gasped. She 
didn&#146;t stay on her stage anymore. Now she stood at a dirty street. 
Rough wind played with her evening dress and she started to shiver. 
The air smelled of rain and of steam. Dirty and used.

&#147;NO!&#148;

She saw her Ruka down the street. It seemed as if she was fighting 
against someone Michiru couldn&#146;t see.

Is that a new vision?

Michiru frowned and wondered if another enemy was near. She had those 
visions quite often when they still searched for the talismans and 
thought that they had to kill the messiah of silence.

Lucky that Sailor Moon changed most of my visions.

&#147;No...&#148;

Now the scream died away and Michiru could see how her Ruka was 
attacked by several shadows. Then the vision was gone and she stood on 
her stage again, just finishing the last note of her last song. 
Confused she stared into the applauding audience. For several times 
she blinked and thanked to the guy who brought her flowers. Her and 
the other artists who had given the beneficial concert with her. There 
had been ten concerts over two weeks. This was the last one and 
tomorrow she would return home. To her Himme-chan and to her Ruka.

Strange, this dream.

After the curtain fell down she went back into her cloakroom, still 
thinking about the vision.

Hope Ruka&#146;s alright.

She frowned, laid her violin carefully into the instrument case, put 
the flowers on the table and automatically dialled a number at her 
handy. It beeped for about ten times. She took a deep breathe and 
tried it again.

It&#146;s in the middle of the night, you baka! Surely she&#146;s sleeping deep 
and tight.

Michiru smiled as she imagined her Ruka laying on her bed. Her hairs 
messed, the blanket laying at the carpet around the bed.

Usually she creeps under my blanket in the middle of the night. But 
today I am not there. Hope she doesn&#146;t freeze tonight.

At the moment she wanted to give up she heard how the telephone was 
answered.

&#147;Hai? Here&#146;s at Kaioh and Ten&ocirc;.&#148; she heard a low, shaky voice. It 
sounded strange in her ears and Michiru sat down in a chair and 
frowned again.

Has she been crying?

Michiru shook her head, suddenly very pale and very, very worried. But 
then she remembered how late it was and that she probably woke her 
lover up. Surely Haruka&#146;s voice was full of sleep.

Hell, I am so concerned after that silly vision!

&#147;Gomen, Ruka. Here&#146;s Michiru. I didn&#146;t want to wake you up, but...&#148; 
She smiled as she heard how her lover took the handy and moved back 
into her bedroom. Her smile grew wilder as she heard how Haruka 
stumbled &#150; surely over her blanket &#150; and cursed as she hit her right 
leg at the bed.

&#147;Hi Michi-chan. You don&#146;t have to apologize. I love it to be waken up 
by your beautiful voice.&#148; Teased her the young car racer and laughed. 
But it was somehow a shaky laughter. And there was another strange 
noise at the background. Like water falling.

Is the shower working?

&#147;Is it raining?&#148; asked Michiru instead and was kind of relieved as

Haruka agreed. &#147;I had a strange vision and I wanted to make sure that 
you&#146;re feeling alright.&#148;

She heard how Haruka groaned and heard how the young racer opened a 
door. Surely to enter the huge balcony that overlook the wide ocean.

&#147;Don&#146;t tell me that the sea&#146;s getting wild again. It&#146;s almost two 
years that we defeated Mistress 9. I thought it&#146;s over now and that 
Sailor Moon doesn&#146;t have to fight anymore. That the danger&#146;s over 
now.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know, Ruka. Maybe it was just a silly dream I had. I played a 
love song and I guess I missed you too much. Especially after the 
attack three weeks ago. You know, I overreact so easily.&#148; Michiru 
walked over to the window and raised her head to look at the moon. 
Knowing that Haruka was watching the same moon right in that moment. 
She heard how her girlfriend took a deep breathe.

&#147;And, how was your concert?&#148; asked the young racer and changed the 
topic. Michiru smiled sadly. She knew that Haruka wanted to comfort 
her and was depressed that she couldn&#146;t. Because several hundred miles 
parted them. Michiru looked at her violin case and made a decision.

&#147;Fine.&#148; She answered while she took her robe out of her wardrobe.

&#147;Ruka?&#148;

&#147;Hai?&#148; The voice was very silent at the other end of the line and 
Michiru could imagine an almost sleeping Haruka. Surely her eyes were 
closed and she leaned against the handrail of the balcony.

&#147;I love you, sweetheart.&#148;

There was a tender laughter and the noise of a soft kiss.

&#147;I love you, too, darling.&#148;

***

She kneeled next to the bed. Unable to move. Unable to think. She 
stared with empty green eyes at the sleeping girl down in the small 
bed, holding her teddy tight in her tiny arms.

Haruka swallowed hard. Her hairs were still wet and although she 
changed her pyjama twice that night the cloth was still sweaty. Her 
fists were clenched in her lap and the pain was driving her crazy. But 
she didn&#146;t make any sound. No whimper, no sobbing. She simply kneeled 
there and observed her daughter.

I mustn&#146;t give up.

Haruka stretched her shaking hand and touched dark hairs that felt 
like velvet. The little girl didn&#146;t awake. A smile laid on her face 
while she dreamed an innocent child&#146;s dream.

I mustn&#146;t give up for Himme-chan.

***

It was already dawn when she came home. It had been an exhausting fly 
and it took her some nerves to get a taxi at that early hour that 
brought her from the airport to the light house by the sea.

Michiru put her violin case on the round table at the kitchen and 
moved silently upstairs. She rubbed her burning eyes and yawned. She 
didn&#146;t sleep a lot during the past 24 hours but she had to come back. 
To know that everything was alright. To know that her Ruka and her 
Himme-chan were okay. To know that her vision hadn&#146;t been more than 
just a silly nightmare.

&#147;Ruka?&#148; she whispered as she sneaked into their bedroom. The first 
lights of a new born day shone through the open window. It was very 
cold in the room and the bed was a mess. Both blankets laid on the 
carpet, the pillows looked as if someone had squeezed them very hard. 
Only an old teddy bear laid carefully on that chaos. Safe and secure.

Michiru smiled as she went over to touch the brown fur. Sometimes 
Ruka&#146;s still a small child. And that&#146;s good so.

She heard the rushes of the shower and went over to the bathroom. But 
it was empty. Only the shower was running. Steam filled the bathroom, 
the mirrors were blind. Some towels laid on the ground and Michiru 
knew that Haruka tried her best to tidy up the house but finally 
failed. She has other qualities.

Michiru turned off the shower and left the bedroom. She found her 
lover at the child&#146;s room. The young racer kneeled next to the small 
bed. She wasn&#146;t sleeping. The senshi of the wind stared with tired 
eyes at a hard breathing Hotaru. A white, wet towel laid on the small 
girl&#146;s forehead and her cheeks were redden. Several medicine laid 
around on the soft carpet and some sheets of paper covered the handy.

&#147;Ruka?&#148; whispered Michiru and looked scared at her daughter. Her heart 
stopped to beat as Haruka turned around and the young violinist looked 
into a very pale and very tired face. Then it beat again as the young 
car racer smiled slightly at her.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, Michi-chan. She has only a cold. Three days ago we went 
into Tokyo&#146;s zoo and it got very late and very cold in the evening. I 
didn&#146;t mention that she was freezing and now she and Chibiusa lay in 
bed with fever and cough. But the doctor says that there&#146;s nothing to 
be worried about. She&#146;ll be okay within the next two or three days.&#148; 
Declared Haruka and Michiru could feel how much she trembled as she 
embraced her girlfriend carefully.

&#147;Gomen, Michi-chan. It was my fault. I should protect Himme-chan from 
every danger and not to make her ill!&#148; whispered the young car racer, 
lowered her head and leaned it against Michiru&#146;s shoulder.

She&#146;s so nice warm. She feels so good.

&#147;Hush, Ruka. It&#146;s not your fault. She&#146;s a small child and it&#146;s normal 
to be a little bit sick during the cold autumn&#146;s and winter&#146;s time. As 
long as it&#146;s not serious.&#148; Michiru squeezed her lover tighter and gave 
her a tender kiss on the forehead. Haruka didn&#146;t look up. She 
oppressed a yawn and closed her eyes.

&#147;You guarded her the whole of the night?&#148; asked Michiru softly after a 
while and started rocking her still trembling lover. She knew how much 
Haruka loved Hotaru and she knew how scared the senshi of the wind was 
of ever losing their daughter. Although she would have never admitted 
it openly.

&#147;Hai.&#148; A low, tired answer.

After I took three showers that couldn&#146;t clean me.

&#147;Then have some rest, Ruka. I&#146;ll keep an eye on her. Don&#146;t worry, I 
slept enough in the plane.&#148; Declared Michiru, reached over for another 
blanket and covered the freezing body of her lover. Haruka didn&#146;t 
protest. She simply laid down on the soft carpet, laid her head in 
Michiru&#146;s lap and allowed her mind to drift away into a dark 
dreamland. She felt how Michiru started to stroke her short blonde 
hairs and suddenly the loneliness disappeared from her life that had 
haunted her down just some hours ago. The emptiness.

It feels so right...

&#147;Michi-chan?&#148; asked Haruka and yawned again before sleep could take 
away her thoughts. Her doubts and her fears.

&#147;Hai?&#148; The stroking didn&#146;t stop and the young car racer was very 
grateful about it.

&#147;Arigato that you came home earlier. It means much for me &#150; and for 
Himme-chan.&#148; Haruka was even too tired to blush.

When did I sleep the last time? Really sleep?

She frowned but relaxed as the stroking kept going on. Somewhere she 
heard a soft voice humming a sweet melody.

Guess I slept the last time before Michiru went to her concerts. And 
the last real sleep was before that day three weeks ago...

&#147;I know, sweetheart. Have sweet dreams.&#148; Declared the young violinist 
and rocked her lover gently. &#147;I love you, Ruka.&#148;

The senshi of the wind only smiled a thin smile before she finally 
fell asleep.

***

Grey light filled the arena as she walked towards her race car. It 
sparkled red and thoughtfully she stroke over the lacquer. It felt 
soft under her finger tips. But also cold and lifeless.

How could this ever been so important to me?

Haruka put her helmet over her head and climbed behind the steering 
wheel. For a long time she stared blank at the displays and rested 
motionless in her seat.

How could I&#146;ve been so blind?

The race had been very important for her a long time ago. Now she knew 
that the most important thing in her whole life her family was. But 
know she wasn&#146;t sure if it wasn&#146;t already too late for that wonderful 
dream.

I&#146;ve been such a baka! To let my future die like this...

***

The fans yelled at the winners. Although it was bitter cold the arena 
was filled. Today was another important race of this year&#39;s Grand Prix 
and their most favourite car racer won this race. Only two more races 
and he would have won the whole battle: Ten&ocirc; Haruka.

She stood at the stage and hold up her trophy. A tomboy smile laid on 
her face and she winked at the fans. They yelled back and the second 
and the third winner splashed her with champagne. But she didn&#39;t feel 
the cool fluid wetting her red racing suit. She didn&#39;t feel the wind 
playing with her sweaty short blonde hairs. She didn&#39;t even see the 
flashes from the cameras that crossed the air. Motionless she stood 
there, holding her trophy and grinning a frozen smile. Her eyes looked 
empty at the reporters and she only threw the champagne at the other 
winners because it was tradition.

Once she had loved that moment. She had enjoyed every second she could 
stay on this stage. Often Michiru climbed on this stage, too and she 
splashed her, too.

And afterwards we took a shower - together...

Haruka shivered and was grateful that she was now allowed to leave the 
stage. She sneaked through different corridors and sighed relieved 
when she saw that there was no reporter on her secret way. She didn&#39;t 
want to talk about her newest victory. Because it wasn&#39;t so important 
to her anymore.

I am glad that Michiru didn&#39;t come.

Surely the senshi of the wide ocean had seen the sadness she tried 
desperately to hide behind her tomboy smile. But Michiru had to take 
care for Hotaru. Although the fever was gone, the little girl still 
felt weak. She needed her parents around to get quickly healthy again.

Over three weeks since that day...

Haruka entered her team&#39;s rooms and laid the trophy and her helmet on 
the table. Hotaru recovered well and only if you looked closer you 
could see the thin scar on her forehead. But mostly it was covered by 
her shoulder long black hairs.

I am so glad that she doesn&#39;t remember it.

Hotaru was a happy, always laughing and wild little girl again. After 
three days she was allowed to leave the hospital - together with her 
Haruka-papa. Since that time everything turned it&#39;s known way. They 
went to the zoo, ate ice cream, fed the ducky at the lake near the 
park. But at the same time everything was different. Haruka drove her 
races and won one after another. She broke the track records not only 
once and she had more than once an argument with Michiru that she 
shouldn&#39;t race so wild. So dangerously. During the two weeks Michiru 
had been at her beneficial concerts she called her up more than once 
to tell her that she didn&#146;t like her style at the last race.

Haruka sighed and locked the door. Then she stripped her race suit 
slowly and walked over to the bathroom. For a long time she stared at 
her reflection in the mirror and sighed again. Dark green eyes looked 
empty back at her. The bruises disappeared and nothing remembered in 
her face or at the other skin of her body what happened only three 
weeks ago. That a man actually defeated her. That he beat her down 
until she bleed.

He almost broke my right arm.

Still it hurt sometimes when she moved it but she could live with that 
pain. 

Sparkling tears shone in her eyes and she turned away from the other 
woman that seemed to be a stranger for her with a sudden.

This pain is so tiny compared with the other pain...

Haruka swallowed hard and stripped her underwear. She didn&#39;t want to 
look at her naked body and so she wrapped a towel around it. Then she 
stepped into the cabin and closed her eyes as the hot water fall down 
on her.

I wish I could tell Michi-chan.

Haruka sighed worn-out and stood under the shower. The hot water 
burned on her skin but it couldn&#39;t wash away the dirt she still felt 
on her pale skin. She took so many showers the last three weeks she 
wondered if she was turning into a fish one day. But she couldn&#146;t wash 
the dirt off her skin. She never felt really clean when she left it. 
Even if she took three showers each night and changed her clothes 
every day.

But it would break her heart.

Somewhere there was shampoo and shower gel but today she didn&#39;t use 
it. She just stood there her head and her shoulder hang. Water ran 
down her back and her face. It tasted salty.

And what about my own heart?

I mustn&#39;t give up!

She clenched her fists and ask herself how she could have been so 
stupid that day three weeks ago. So stupid and so careless. She was 
the senshi of wind. The strongest of all Sailors. But he simply beat 
her down when he got the power over her - with Hotaru.

What else could I have done? Otherwise he would have killed her.

Haruka leaned her head against the wall and swallowed hard. When she 
was together with her lover or with the rest of the Sailor team she 
could ignore her memories, she could forget about that day for a small 
while. But when she was alone, on her own like she was right now, her 
thoughts were haunting her like a wild animal that was trapped in a 
cage. Without a chance of ever escaping again. The water was 
incredible hot but she wouldn&#39;t give in her dizzy feelings. She 
wouldn&#39;t allow herself to let this pain finish. To let it be replaced 
by another, a deeper, a worse kind of pain.

I&#39;d rather die than to lose Himme-chan or Michi-chan.

So she died...

&quot;Ruka?&quot;

She winced fiercely as the door to her cabin was opened. A warm body 
stepped behind her and before she could react she felt soft arms that 
embraced her tenderly.

&quot;Congratulations to your great victory. You beat them all.&quot; Whispered 
Michiru and kissed her girlfriend loving on the neck and smiled as 
Haruka shivered automatically. Hai, I beat them all. I broke the track 
record and won this race. Because I wanted to see if my car would 
break if I&#39;d push it to the limits.

But her car didn&#39;t break and so she reached the finish line as one of 
the fastest racers Japan had ever seen. One year ago she would have 
been happy to be so fast. So popular. So unbeatable. But now all she 
felt was a strange feeling of emptiness she couldn&#39;t get rid of.

Haruka opened her eyes, but she couldn&#39;t turn to face her lover. So 
she stared at the white flagstones that were covered with water. Dust 
rose and filled slowly the cabin. She didn&#39;t move as she felt 
Michiru&#39;s hands opening the towel she was still wearing. It flew with 
a wet noise on the ground and Haruka winced again as she felt her 
lover&#39;s naked body pressed against her own one.

&quot;Is that a new fashion? To take a shower with your towel?&quot; teased 
Michiru and continued to kiss her back.

Haruka swallowed hard but still she wasn&#39;t able to say anything. It 
was so wonderful to be touched by the one and only woman in her life. 
But at the same time it felt so strange. So unreal.

&quot;Michi-chan...&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice was shaky and Michiru giggled as she 
stroke over her lover&#39;s slim belly. She could feel how the taller 
senshi winced again and pressed her harder against herself. &quot;No, 
please, not.&quot; Stammered Haruka and bit on her lower lip as the 
caressing hands stopped at her belly.

&quot;Why?&quot; The young violinist didn&#39;t sound disappointed or angry. She 
simply sounded very surprised. They both liked it to take a shower 
together after one exiting race.

The taller woman didn&#39;t respond anything. She just stood there, her 
hands seized the wall and wet strands of her short blonde hair covered 
her face with shadows. Michiru wasn&#39;t able to see her lover&#39;s 
expression. So she started her caressing again and smiled tenderly as 
she heard her lover&#39;s oppressed groans. She had a hard day at the 
track. That race was very important for the whole Grand Prix. Guess I 
simply have to show her that it&#39;s over now.

Michiru&#39;s smile became wolfish as her hands touched Haruka&#39;s legs and 
the tall woman winced again.

This feels so damn good!

Haruka closed her eyes again and tried to concentrated on her lover&#39;s 
touch. Only on her touch. That could help her to forget what happened 
in the past.

She&#39;s my future. She and Hotaru. They&#39;re the only reasons for me being 
alive any longer...

Haruka sighed deeply as she felt Michiru&#39;s hands at her most sensitive 
skin and automatically spread her legs.

Still the water was falling from above and it was very warm. It 
covered her like a nice blanket. Together with her lover at her side. 
Here no one could do her any harm. Here she was safe and secure. Here 
the night and all nightmares didn&#39;t exist any longer.

&gt;Whore!&lt;

Haruka eyes flew wide open as she heard the rude voice in her head. 
Over and over again.

&quot;No...&quot; she whimpered and pushed Michiru&#39;s hands away. Her whole body 
trembled as she reached for her wet towel and left the cabin as if 
there was suddenly something really frightening in it. Michiru blinked 
confused and switched off the shower. Then she followed her lover. 
Haruka covered her naked body quickly with her wide black shirt and 
reached for her dark jeans.

She lost weight. I didn&#39;t mention it.

Michiru frowned as she went over to her lover - still naked.

&quot;We should go now. Hotaru&#39;s surely waiting for us. I can&#39;t believe 
that you...&quot;

&quot;Hush.&quot; Michiru embraced her taller girlfriend and felt how she 
trembled. Shortly she saw into sad green eyes before Haruka turned her 
head away. &quot;Hotaru&#39;s safe. Ami and Rei are with her. I simply wanted 
to watch your race.&quot; She raised her hand and stroke through the wet 
short hairs. They felt like velvet. &quot;Gomen, Michi-chan. The race was 
exhausting and I don&#39;t... I mean, I...&quot; Haruka sighed deeply but 
Michiru interrupted her words with a short but loving kiss.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to apologize. We&#39;ll have enough time for ourselves at 
the week-end.&quot; She giggled and leaned her head against Haruka&#39;s 
shoulder. She felt how her lover embraced her, too and pressed her 
slightly against the still trembling body.

Why is she so excited?

Michiru frowned and held her taller senshi tighter. 

Is it really just because of that race?

&quot;If our Himme-chan gives us that time.&quot; Answered Haruka very slowly 
and leaned her head against Michiru&#39;s and smelled the scent of her sea 
green hairs. She knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to take that time for 
her girlfriend the next week-end. She didn&#39;t even knew if she would 
ever be able again.

I love you so much! But I don&#39;t want to hurt you...

&quot;Hotaru&#39;s feeling better now. What do you think if we&#39;re going to the 
cinema the next Saturday? Usagi and the other want to come with us. 
It&#39;s a cartoon about chicken and it should be very funny.&quot; Asked 
Michiru, her eyes still closed. Still leaning against her lover. 
Enjoying the presence and the embrace of the other one.

&quot;It sounds okay. If Himme-chan likes that movie I&#39;d watch everything.&quot; 
Declared Haruka and felt how her shirt was getting wet again. But she 
didn&#39;t care about it.  &quot;How could you sneak into this room? I locked 
the door.&quot;

Michiru raised her head and deep blue eyes looked for some seconds 
into dark green ones. It&#39;s the first time that she locked it. She 
never felt affected when one of her team colleagues came into and saw 
her naked. Why is she suddenly so shy?

&quot;Can&#39;t you remember? Once you gave me that key so that I could come 
when you&#39;re still at the track to prepare our shower.&quot; She giggled as 
Haruka blushed deeply. But there was something in the taller woman&#39;s 
eyes that made her frown again. Michiru stepped on her tip toes and 
kissed her carefully. It was a light, tender kiss. And for the first 
time Haruka let it be so soft. So tenderly. For the first time she 
didn&#39;t give in her temper and the kiss didn&#39;t get more passionate.

&quot;Ruka...?&quot; asked Michiru concerned and raised her hands to caress over 
the now redden cheeks.

&quot;Everything&#146;s fine, Michi-chan. Just a little bit tired.&quot; Haruka 
smiled a brave smile and gave her lover another light kiss.

You liar! Nothing is okay! And you&#39;ve never been tired when she wanted 
to love you!

Haruka didn&#39;t listen to her inner voice. All she wanted to concentrate 
on was the woman next to her. Who wanted her. Needed her. Obviously 
loved her.

&quot;I love you, Ruka.&quot; Whispered Michiru after another kiss ended slowly 
and the tender smile that appeared on her face melt a bit of the ice 
that was wrapped around Haruka&#39;s heart. The young car racer tightened 
the embracement and pulled her girlfriend closer. Then she buried her 
face in wet sea green hairs and could forget that anything else 
existed but the warm body beside her. I love you, too, Michi-chan. 
Haruka swallowed hard and could fight back her tears as she felt how 
Michiru&#39;s hands slipped under her wide shirt and started automatically 
to caress the soft skin of her back. As if she instinctively wanted to 
calm her lover down.

I love you. And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to hurt you.

As much as I had been hurt...

The sea birds screamed outside the house and an anime hero screamed 
inside of the TV-set. Hotaru sat in front of it and watched her heroes 
with big eyes. A blanket was wrapped around her small body while she 
drank some gulps of her hot honey milk. Michiru laid next to her on 
the couch and slept deep and tight. It had been a long night with the 
still ill girl and now here tiredness had overtaken her.

None of them noticed the tall woman standing silent in the shadows of 
the door. Haruka watched her family for a long time without saying a 
word.

I love them so much.

Hard she fought against her tears as she thought about the test she 
did in hospital. Still she had no results and she was very concerned 
about it.

What if it&#146;s positive?

Haruka swallowed hard. Then she turned away and left the house by the 
sea to take a long walk along the beach.

What if I&#146;ll lose them forever?
