<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 29 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>Sailor V leapt gracefully, the white and red sailor
fuku hugging her body as she bounded from rooftop to
rooftop across the city of Tokyo at night. Her blonde
hair glittered, skin pale but healthy as she landed,
looking about curiously from beneath her mask.

Silently the other figure landed right beside her, her
own short black hair mussed slightly. Her skin was
almost deathly pale and her purple eyes glittered
dangerously, her lips rising in a slight smile. &quot;So,
what are we looking for?&quot; Hotaru Tomoe asked softly.

&quot;I was waiting for you,&quot; Sailor V admitted.

A curious look crossed Hotaru&#39;s face as she studied
Sailor V, &quot;Why?&quot;

Sailor V gave her a gaze filled with gentle concern,
&quot;You haven&#39;t fed yet, have you?&quot;

Hotaru tensed slightly, looking away from Sailor V as
she clenched her black gloved hands. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she
said harshly.

&quot;Setsuna still hasn&#39;t cured you,&quot; Sailor V said
firmly, meeting Hotaru&#39;s eyes, &quot;you need to drain
energy from someone to survive.&quot;

&quot;I ate a few nights ago,&quot; Hotaru reminded her firmly,
&quot;I don&#39;t need to take more.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t joke, please,&quot; Sailor V pulled her white glove
off, reaching out and offering her bare hand to
Hotaru.

All it took was the touch of bare skin to hers and
Hotaru would begin to pull the lifeforce from a
person&#39;s body, sucking the very energies of survival
from them. Even the presence of Sailor V so near
tempted her, made her heart beat faster, but she made
herself turn away. &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you,&quot; she
said roughly.

&quot;Hotaru?&quot; Sailor V asked softly.

Reluctantly Hotaru turned back to look at Minako only
to feel soft lips press to her own, her life-saving
curse kicking in immediately. Gently Sailor V kissed
her, short moments stretching out between them as
vitality poured out of Sailor V into the other woman,
then she finally pulled back, staggering slightly with
tiredness.

Swiftly Hotaru grabbed her arm, steadying her. &quot;Why
did you...?&quot; she blurted out, looking much younger
than her normally confident manner implied.

Sailor V pulled off her white mask and Minako smiled,
&quot;You weren&#39;t listening and I don&#39;t think you would
have taken from me willingly.&quot; She shook off the
momentary weakness and put her mask back on as she
said firmly, &quot;Ready to go?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am,&quot; Hotaru said, guiltily aware of how good
she had felt even after the momentary contact between
them. &#39;And why is my heart beating so fast?&#39; she
wondered as she and the lovely blonde took off into
the night.

They had been going out on these patrols for several
weeks now, hunting down the Youma that still haunted
the night. These creatures had preyed on humanity for
many centuries, allied with their dark lords the Oni
and recently they had very nearly opened the way for
the Oni queen&#39;s return. Only an unlikely alliance of
heroes had stopped it, and their victory had been a
very near thing. In the aftermath Sailor V had been
determined to reduce their numbers to prevent such an
attack again and Hotaru had joined her in that quest
eagerly.

They hit a rooftop running as Sailor V said, &quot;There&#39;s
been a recent rash of killings in this area, it has
the stink of the Oni about it.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot; Hotaru asked seriously, easily keeping pace.

&quot;I got in to see the bodies as Minako Aino,&quot; Sailor V
grinned wickedly as she explained, &quot;I lied and told
them I was working on a new crime T.V. show. They
literally shone with the remains of dark spells.&quot; She
scowled, &quot;I just wish I had Artemis there, he could
have told us more about what they were doing.&quot;

&quot;I think he and Luna are a little busy right now,&quot;
Hotaru noted with some amusement. The guardian cats
paired with Usagi and Minako had once been lovers
until duty put them on opposing sides, and only
recently had they rediscovered their love.

&quot;I&#39;d like to be busy that way,&quot; Sailor V joked as she
finally stopped in what might be considered the bad
part of town.

&#39;Me, too,&#39; Hotaru silently admitted as she landed by
her side in a moment. Aloud she asked, &quot;So do you have
a plan?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Sailor V conceded, &quot;but assuming the
Oni or Youma are here, I think that our presence here
should get some attention.&quot;

A faint smile as Hotaru asked, &quot;So we&#39;re bait?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s about it,&quot; Sailor V agreed. They stood there a
moment, the breeze gently stirring their clothes then
she softly said, &quot;Do you see them?&quot;

Hotaru didn&#39;t show anything was wrong, &quot;No, but I hear
them.&quot; She flexed her hands as she muttered, &quot;I wish I
still had my polearm...&quot;

Out of the darkness they burst forth, the creatures
that human&#39;s called Youma! They seemed human, on first
look, but their misshapen limbs and scarred faces put
a lie to that illusion. With nearly inhuman strength
they piled on, the numbers overwhelming the two
warriors, until the eight of them held the two of them
captive.

&quot;So good to see you again, sweet Hotaru,&quot; the familiar
voice purred as the light brown haired figure emerged
from the shadows.

&quot;Zoisite,&quot; Hotaru growled faintly, silently cursing
the gauntlets that her captors wore, preventing her
from stealing their lives.

Zoisite ignored Sailor V, his complete attention
focused on Hotaru. &quot;You traitor,&quot; he hissed at her,
&quot;you have twisted the precious gift that had been
granted to you by our Queen, turning it against your
brothers and sisters.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a gift it&#39;s a curse,&quot; Hotaru glared at him
with eyes as cold as winter, &quot;come a bit closer so
that I can show you!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not that foolish,&quot; Zoisite kept his distance from
Hotaru, the fear in his stance contradicting his
casual tone.

&quot;You&#39;re afraid of Hotaru and that&#39;s wise,&quot; Sailor V
murmured as she deliberately drew his eyes to her,
&quot;but you should have been watching me.&quot; Sudden the
dark blood of a Youma splattered them all as she used
a hidden knife to strike, then smoothly slipped her
golden length of chain into her hand. She struck, the
weighted end lashing out to wrap around the throat of
a Youma, a twist of her wrist slaying the one
restraining Hotaru.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Hotaru bit another one, clamping down with her
teeth as it howled, it&#39;s life force pouring into her
body like a foul wave.

Zoisite threw a bolt of dark force as he growled,
&quot;Damn you!&quot;

Sailor V cried out in pain as the power threw her
backward and Hotaru saw red. With a murderous fury she
broke free of the remaining Youma, her power scything
out like the weapon of Death herself to kill them.
With a dangerous calm she advanced on Zoisite, her
gaze deadly.

&quot;Hotaru,&quot; Sailor V murmured in shock and more than a
little awe.

&quot;Stay back,&quot; Zoisite&#39;s voice broke with fear as he
struck out with his power again, but Hotaru just
ignored it.

&quot;You hurt her,&quot; Hotaru&#39;s voice was as cold as her
eyes, &quot;the one who is precious to me.&quot;

Sailor V shook of her daze, listening with a bit of
surprise. &#39;Precious to her?&#39; she thought, feeling a
surprising burst of warmth within her.

Blinded by his own fear Zoisite tried to punch her,
not realizing he had made a fatal mistake. Zoisite
grabbed his arm and in a second the connection was
made, life force pouring out of Zoisite in a wave into
the smaller woman. His knees buckled and he slumped.
voice whisper soft as he pitifully begged, &quot;Please,
no....&quot;

&quot;Never,&quot; Hotaru said bleakly and in seconds he fell to
the ground, life snuffed like a candle. As Sailor V
walked up behind her she felt a chill as the battle
lust faded and what Hotaru had done fully registered
on her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Sailor V said quietly. Hotaru turned to her
in surprise and she smiled, removing her mask. &quot;I&#39;m no
hypocrite,&quot; Minako met her violet eyes with her own
blue ones, &quot;it&#39;s no less than he deserved, especially
after what he did to Usagi&#39;s family.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Hotaru answered softly.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Minako answered. Part of her wanted to ask
about what Hotaru had meant when she had said she was
precious to her, but she decided it could wait. She
smiled slightly, knowing that they had time.

&quot;What?&quot; Hotaru asked, seeing that smile.

&quot;Just thinking that I&#39;m going to enjoy being your
partner,&quot; she said, slipping her Sailor V mask back
on. She grinned as she raced to the side of the roof,
&quot;Let&#39;s go give Usagi the good news.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Hotaru grinned back, following her happily.

End.

Notes: This is set a few weeks after the end of
Senshi. After publishing the final chapter I
remembered I had not dealt with Zoisite, the villain
who had killed Usagi&#39;s adopted parents in the story,
so I intended to write a ficcy where he was.. dealt with.</pre>
