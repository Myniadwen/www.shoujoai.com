<p>Note to all:  This may not have any immediate consequences, but notice how I  phrased, “chance in hell of  convincing me to go into the music industry with you like <em>that</em>...  “ can imply that there may be another way...? --waggles eyebrows  suggestively--</p>
<p>--Frown--  I just realized that if Minako came for Usagi's wedding FOUR years  after everything happened... she would have “set foot” in Japan  again... no? --sigh-- oh the woes of time and forgetfulness. Well...  let's just say... the same thing happened as with the special act...  but since she didn't get to spend much time with Minako due to being  in the hospital and Minako leaving again... Rei doesn't count that as  “coming home”. --shrug--</p>
<p>Okay, all done!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>With the snap of her fingers, Rei  had completely turned a happy moment into a hopeless one.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Come on inside, it's getting  cold. Partner or not, I don't want to be held liable for a sick  singer. Besides, we can talk of better things while you stay over  tonight.”</em></p>
<p>Minako blinked in surprise. <em>She's  letting me stay over anyway...?</em></p>
<p>Rei turned to look  back at her after taking a few steps towards the shrine. “What's  wrong? Are you coming or aren't you?”</p>
<p>“I am, I am!” Minako hurried to  catch up to Rei, walking side by side with a childish grin. “Thank  you... Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>Rei sighed, continuing her walk. It  wasn't until they reached the patio that Rei remembered. “Oh...  right. Minako.” Minako looked at her questioningly as she stepped  onto the familiar wooden surface. She was startled beyond all words  when Rei turned to face her, her hair floating around her like a  sheet of softly falling snow, and gave her an equally soft, small  smile. “Welcome back.”</p>
<p>In that moment, if only for that one  moment, Minako felt all her other thoughts melt away. Nothing else  mattered but that single moment in time. Not singing. Not what her  manager wanted. Nothing of convincing Rei away from her home. Nothing  of the loneliness she had felt while on tour. Nothing else. Nothing  else but her sweet, wholesome Rei.</p>
<p>A furious blush rose up to Minako's  cheeks the moment that thought had entered her mind and effectively  snapped her out of her daze. Why did she think that? Rei wasn't  hers... never was and never... no, and never would be. Rei was a free  spirit, and that was what Minako lo- She had to stop again, shaking  the thoughts away forcefully.</p>
<p>She half turned away, a confused, but  still happy smile on her face. She responded in kind, “I'm home.”</p>
<p>And she felt like she had never spoken  truer words thus far. Minako glanced up, seeing Rei's mildly addled  expression, and couldn't help but let out a giggle. Her  characteristic frowned returned, and Minako smiled.</p>
<p><em>This</em> was home... with Rei.</p>
<p>“I bought some new tea today, would  you like to try it?”</p>
<p>Minako blinked and  smiled again as she followed the shrine maiden. “What kind is it?”</p>
<p>“... Strawberry... vanilla.”</p>
<p>Minako stared  amazed as Rei seemed to pointedly avoid looking at her. <em>That's my  favorite! But... doesn't Rei-chan hate that kind? She said it was too  sweet... Did she... did she buy it just for me?</em></p>
<p>“You don't want any?”</p>
<p>Minako giggled,  protesting again, “I want it, I want it! Of course I want it! Thank  you, Rei.”</p>
<p>Rei grunted without  really saying anything else. They made their way to the kitchen,  which was surprisingly close to Rei's room, and they had their tea at  the coffee table in the latter.</p>
<p>Rei watched quietly  as Minako took a large sip from her cup and sighed gratefully  afterwards. She took a sip herself, inwardly blanching again at the  sweetness, still watching the singer.</p>
<p>Minako was looking  around the room, and as she did, Rei did too, just to make sure she  hadn't forgotten to stow any... private treasures away.</p>
<p>When Minako gasped  and grinned, Rei realized she had missed at least one. <em>Oh great...  here it comes...</em></p>
<p>Minako got up and  went to Rei's dresser. Following her with her eyes, Rei breathed a  sigh of relief. <em>Oh, just that. Good. I thought it'd be...</em></p>
<p>“You have such a funny expression in  this one, Rei-chan,” Minako giggled.</p>
<p>Rei frowned, trying  to remember <em>exactly</em> which group picture that was.</p>
<p>Minako brought it  back to the table. Rei looked, and inwardly groaned. She remembered  now... “It couldn't be helped. Usagi... was being Usagi again.”</p>
<p>Rei hoped Minako  wouldn't realize that she had actually been looking at Minako, on the  other side of Usagi, when the picture had been taken. She fought down  the blush that was threatening to surface.</p>
<p>“This was taken... the day we were  all reunited, wasn't it?” There was a small forlorn smile on  Minako's lips now as she gazed upon the framed photo.</p>
<p>Rei smiled in the  same way, still watching the singer. “Yeah... that was... a great  day...” <em>Because you came back too...</em></p>
<p>Minako looked up at  her. Rei was already staring off into space elsewhere. “What are  the others doing?”</p>
<p>“Same thing they were doing when you  came for Usagi's wedding. Well, Makoto and Motoki have their flower  shop; Ami is a doctor using Tokyo as her home base; and Usagi's... a  homemaker.”</p>
<p>Minako set the  frame on the table and propped up her elbow as she looked at Rei.  “What about you?”</p>
<p>“I'm the head of this shrine.”</p>
<p>Minako raised an  eyebrow. “You weren't before?”</p>
<p>Rei scoffed. “Of  course not! How could I be? I was still underage and inexperienced. I  just took care of the shrine; I didn't <em>own</em> it or anything.”</p>
<p>“But you do now?”</p>
<p>“Well... yeah. And I hired workers to  help take care of the place now. People... just... keep coming...”  Rei looked away again, knowing perfectly well why the shrine was  busier these days.</p>
<p>Minako grinned,  also knowing why. “You know what's amazing? Well, no, not amazing-  I mean, I saw it coming and everything, but still. I saw you.” Rei  blinked. “When I was in London. You were in one of the global  newspapers for the total accuracy of your predictions. It said you  had saved the president (Does Japan have a president? If not... the  head honcho of the government, whoever that is) because you knew an  assassin was coming, and you helped capture him.” Minako watched,  amused, as she saw a thin blush on Rei's cheeks.</p>
<p>“I only did that because I knew I  needed more monetary support and the fire showed it to me out of  nowhere one day.”</p>
<p>“You're still a hero.”</p>
<p>Rei glanced at  Minako, hearing the soft, mesmerized tone of her voice. She looked  away again with a frown. “Aren't we all a little 'heroic' still?  Ami saves countless lives as a doctor... Makoto finds the perfect  flower arrangement to cheer anyone up... just like your songs give  the kids something to... to look forward to.”</p>
<p>There was a  silence, but it was a comfortable, easy silence.</p>
<p>“What about Usagi?”</p>
<p>Rei snorted without  thinking about it. She then smiled as she answered, “Well... ditzy  as she is... Usagi makes anyone around her just a little bit  happier... so she doesn't have any particular audience. In her way...  she's still the greatest of all of us.” Her eyes glinted as she  looked up at Minako. “But you know... she spends half her  afternoons at the local kindergarten, playing with the kids. I  watched her a few times; the kids are always giving her a hard time.  But they're all always laughing.”</p>
<p>They shared another  daydream sort of silence.</p>
<p>“The tea's cold.”</p>
<p>Rei raised an  eyebrow as Minako looked thoughtfully down at her cup. She sighed.  “Maybe it's a sign that we should just go to sleep?”</p>
<p>Minako drank the  rest of her cup anyway. She then smiled innocently. “I suppose.  Where am I sleeping tonight, exactly?”</p>
<p>Rei looked around,  as if suddenly realizing what had been meant by her offer to house  Minako for the night. She sighed again, standing up to walk over to  the closet with a spare futon.</p>
<p>“You can't stay in any other room,  because one, all the others are occupied, and two, half of them are  diehard fans of yours, so if they went into one of the rooms and  found you there...”</p>
<p>Minako giggled at  the look on Rei's face just then. “They won't come in here?”</p>
<p>“They shouldn't... not if the door's  locked. Oh... do you want to take a bath first? You've been  traveling... and considering you just came back today...”</p>
<p>Minako just  noticed, as Rei gestured, that Rei had her own hallway to what she  presumed was the bathroom. “Well... that actually sounds like a  good idea... but I don't have any spare clothes with me?”</p>
<p>“You can borrow mine.”</p>
<p>A faint sensation  bordering on a thrill of anticipation coursed through Minako's veins  at the thought of wearing Rei's clothes. She shook it off hurriedly.  “Really? Then okay, I guess I should...”</p>
<p>Rei set down the  futon and went over to the dresser and picked out a folded set of  clothes. She turned around and held them out to Minako as she stood  up. “Take as long as you like, but try not to be <em>too</em> loud or  anything, okay?”</p>
<p>Minako nodded.  “Well then, I'll be back in a little while.”</p>
<p>As Minako left the  vicinity of the room, Rei silently unfolded the futon and set it... a  foot or so away from hers. She then stepped back to look at it... and  felt a strong vibe of something not being right. So she adjusted it  so the sides of their futons were touching. Her instincts told her it  was all better now, but her mind was now having doubts, having her so  close. She pulled it away again. The niggling got more insistent. She  put it back. Her mind protested...</p>
<p>She growled slammed  them almost forcefully together, stepping on the nearest corner as if  melding it so without any room for more protest.</p>
<p>Her minds  inhibitions trailed away...</p>
<p>And the secret part  of her intuition made her blush fiercely, looking down at the  two-now-one big futon. Closing her eyes to it, she brought the spare  pillow over and set it down smack dab in the middle of the spare  futon. It looked so lonely...</p>
<p>Rei growled in  frustration and just flopped down between the futons, neither here  nor there.</p>
<p>So lonely...</p>
<p><em>Shut UP!</em> Rei  scrunched up the edge of the futon blanket in her fist, squeezing her  eyes shut in much the same way. Peer pressure in a sense- if her hand  was shut tight, as were her eyes, maybe her mind would catch a clue  and shut up too.</p>
<p>Why would you  separate her away from you like so...?</p>
<p>Rei moaned, muffled  by the futon. No luck.</p>
<p><em>Fine! You stupid  little voice...</em> She sat up and moved the pillows together so that  they were touching in the middle of it all. <em>There! Happy! Can I  go to sleep </em>now</p>
<p>Rei looked at the  array... and blushed again. Would Minako... would Minako mind? She  said she didn't want to be alone anymore... but that didn't mean she  wanted Rei to... to...</p>
<p>The pillows were  forced apart.</p>
<p>The little voice  came back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... Minako  found herself lost in thought as she slowly stripped away her  clothes, setting them in the basket provided, and started to scrub  away the dirt of her travels. Well... since she had last bathed  anyway. Which was... last night, actually. Before the plane ride. But  that was beside the point.</p>
<p>Separated from  Rei's direct presence, Minako found herself trapped with her  manager's proposition. It... it hadn't gone <em>exactly</em> as she had  told Rei... but... at least she had told her the way it was as she  saw it.</p>
<p>Minako sighed,  remembering her manager's words, that night before they left.</p>
<p>“<em>It's really your decision,  Minako-chan. These last years have been great, and you've left your  mark on the music industry. But... I've noticed how... unenthusiastic  you've been becoming... and that's no good. Go to Japan. If you can't  find more inspiration for continuing to sing... then use the time to  find an alternative lifestyle. We both know you can't sing </em>forever<em>,  Minako. It just doesn't happen in the entertainment business. Not for  most, anyway. It's just as well we pull you out while the going's  still good. You don't deserve to just fade away in people's memories.  This concert in Tokyo... </em>you <em>decide if it's going to be your  last. Your happiness is most important now.”</em></p>
<p>Minako eased into  the electric heated bathtub, biting her lip in her indecision. The  proposition had been all her idea. She didn't want to lose her  singing career, no matter what anybody said. But... but with Rei's  support of what her manager had said, her resolve had begun to  falter. What... what would <em>really</em> make her happy? She had  started out singing, and she had loved every minute of it, hadn't  she? Hadn't she been happy doing that?</p>
<p>Her mind traveled  back to the moment when she had first seen Rei again, sitting there  on <em>their</em> bench. Waiting for her, seemingly. Minako closed her  eyes, lying back with a long exhale. Her heart had been beating  faster than it ever had during her biggest concert at the peak of her  career. She remembered the feeling, no matter how strange, that had  come over her when Rei smiled at her and welcomed her back.</p>
<p>She sunk a little  lower in the tub. She had missed Rei- there was no point in denying  it, if she ever had.</p>
<p>She likely couldn't  leave again, not with the tug pulling her to Rei being stronger than  ever.</p>
<p>It almost made her  wish she had never stopped by the shrine, never given herself a  chance to hold back.</p>
<p>Hold back...? Was  Rei really holding her back? Minako frowned. No... no, she wasn't, at  least not intentionally. She... she just wanted her to be happy... to  not hurt... to not hurt herself like the way she had...</p>
<p>Minako let out  another sigh.</p>
<p>She eventually  stepped out of the tub, as unresolved as ever. After drying off, she  bent to pick up the clothes Rei had handed her... and stared as it  unfolded.</p>
<p>It was a lavender  slip.</p>
<p>A rather short one  at that.</p>
<p>Minako blushed  furiously, looking at the other contents of the small stack of  clothes. Well... there were shorts too... maybe Rei had mistaken the  lavender piece for... a shirt of a normal kind?</p>
<p>Minako's eyes  traveled past the walls to where Rei was waiting.</p>
<p>She grinned with  the innocence that her fans did <em>not</em> know her for.</p>
<p>Tonight would be  fun... in one way or another.</p>
<p>She set about  putting her borrowed “clothes” on.</p>
