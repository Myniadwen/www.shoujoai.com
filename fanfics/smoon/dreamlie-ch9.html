<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 9 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>It has been four weeks since the first battle with the kyphons. And 
the damaging attack on the High Queen Terrestria. The Senshi were down 
a warrior, and the battles weren&#146;t getting easier. The injured Queen 
was still unconscious. A new, larger bed was built to accommodate her 
large wings. Which were covered in white bandages, contrasting with 
her dark gown. Her panther-like guardian was governing her Kingdom 
while someone was always with her. Hotaru and Serenity were there the 
most. Of coarse no one knew that a certain raven-haired Queen snuck in 
at night.

Then there was the battles. Becoming more intense and difficult each 
blow either side made. The kyphons repeatedly asked to see the Teres 
Princess. They didn&#146;t seem to get it. She wasn&#146;t even a princess, but 
a High Queen. Thankfully no innocents were injured in the fights. 

Soon, yet another month passed. Terrestria laid peacefully under the 
periwinkle blankets of her bed. The only light was that of the moon on 
her unconscious form. One of the large wooden doors opened, spilling 
in light. A tall figure walked in and sat on the bed. The moonlight 
revealed the Mars warrior. Rei held her love&#146;s hand while smoothing 
her soft hair. 

&#147; Dragon, you look so beautiful. Even unconscious you look like an 
angel. Dragon, why you? It couldn&#146;t have been anyone else? You&#146;ve been 
asleep for 2 months Terri. And for some reason your body won&#146;t take my 
energy. You are the heart of our team. You and Serena. With out one we 
can&#146;t function right. I know this ties to me somehow. I feel so 
selfish knowing this. Terri, I&#146;m sorry.&#148; Tears flowed silently . A 
smaller figure came to the bed. Her purple head down. Rei stood up 
quickly to leave. The girl held out a hand to stop her. 

&#147; Don&#146;t go.&#148;

&#147; Hotaru. You heard me. Didn&#146;t you?&#148; Hotaru looked up.

&#147; Yes, I heard. If dragon were awake, you know what she&#146;d say?&#148; Rei 
chuckled

&#147; Yea, &#146;Rei you fool, nothings your fault!&#146; &#147; They laughed for a 
second then stood silent.

&#147; It&#146;s not you know.&#148; Rei looked at Hotaru, Who was just as confused.

&#147; Hotaru&#133;did you&#133;?&#148;

&#147; Nope.&#148; They turned towards the bed. The planet Queen was propped up 
on her pillow, a gentle smile on her lips. 

&#147; TERRI!&#148; The 18 year old ran to hug her &#145;sister&#146;. Rei called the 
others and sat down on a near by couch. The others practically bust 
down the door, running to the bed like a herd of elephants. Everyone 
crowded over Terri like she was gold. Ami finally pushed them back so 
she could do a check.

&#147; Ami can I PLEASE get up?&#148; Terri whined, very rare.

&#147; For a minute then back in bed and sleep. Got that?&#148;

The silver-chestnut haired girl nodded. Her wings flicked and 
expanded. Snapping the bandages like they were nothing. She shot 
upward, almost running into the ceiling. Ami had a look of mock anger.

&#147; Terrestria! I meant walk, not fly!. Your gonna&#133;&#148; At that precise 
moment Terri&#146;s wings disappeared, sending her down. Ami was ready and 
caught her friend.

&#147;&#133;fall. You never listen. Now bed! Doctors orders.&#148; Terri grinned and 
floated to the bed. Ami ushered everyone out. Terri called for Rei to 
stay.

&#147; I heard you.&#148; Her eyes sparkled with tears.

&#147; Every night. You came to talk to me, and I heard you, felt your 
hands in my hair. Firebird&#133;Rei&#133; if this is how you want it&#133;fine. But 
it&#146;s not what I want.&#148; Rei turned towards the door as her eyes misted 
over. Before going out the door she paused.

&#147; I can no longer be concerned with what either of us want. Just what 
the King desires. Goodnight your Majesty.&#148; And she left.

- Fine Firebird, just fine!-</pre>
