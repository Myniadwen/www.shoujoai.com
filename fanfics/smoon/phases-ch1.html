<h1>Phases (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Makoto Kino knew she was dreaming, for she had never
worn clothes like this. She walked away from the
village, the white overcoat of a samurai fluttering
around her. A lighter brown haired girl flitted by her
side, and she turned a moment to see several figures
standing watching them go. The three foolish men she
just ignored, but the woman... she drew Makoto&#39;s gaze
like iron to a magnet.

Meeting the black haired woman in the kimono&#39;s eyes
Makoto recognized her, despite their being relative
strangers. As she walked on she felt a stabbing loss,
as if she had been met to stay with this elegant
woman, but instead she walked on...

...then with a painful cry Makoto awoke, blinking up
at her bedroom ceiling. &quot;Damn it,:&quot; she got up,
kicking the blankets and grabbing at her clothes.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So,&quot; Luna asked as the black cat perched on the
table, &quot;what&#39;s wrong? You look like you barely slept,
Mako-chan.&quot;

Makoto sighed tiredly, the tall brown haired woman
feeling the other girl&#39;s gazes resting on her. &quot;I&#39;ve
been having these very vivid dreams,&quot; she admitted,
&quot;from what almost look like historical movies, or
something.&quot;

&quot;Watching a few too many historical dramas?&quot; Rei Hino
asked, the black haired girl pouring them all some
tea. Despite her traditional style Rei had a firey
temper, one most often brought out by her friend
Usagi.

&quot;I could feel the clothes I wore,&quot; Makoto shook her
head, &quot;and I knew exactly what they were, the weapons
I carried... all of it.&quot;

&quot;:That does seem odd,&quot; Artenis conceded, the white cat
sitting up beside Minako.

Ami pushed up her glasses, the blue haired girl
looking cutely scholarly as she requested with gentle
concern, &quot;Tell me about it.&quot; She flipped open her
Mercury computer and began to type, &quot;Maybe I can help
you research it?&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Makoto smiled.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Ami blushed as she looked down at
the computer screen.

&quot;I had on a kataginu sleeveless jacket,&quot; Makoto made
herself remember, &quot;and a hakama worn over my kimono.&quot;
A pause as her eyes widened, &quot;I was carrying a
katana... and was a wandering ronin.&quot;

&quot;You mean you weren&#39;t in college?&quot; Usagi blinked
innocently, the blonde&#39;s hair flowing in two streams
from buns on her head.

&quot;Baka,&quot; Rei shook her head, &quot;that&#39;s what ronin means
now. In the past a ronin was a masterless samurai
warrior.&quot;

&quot;Rei,&quot; Usagi&#39;s eyes welled up with years, &quot;don&#39;t be so
mean.&quot;

&quot;A woman ronin?&quot; Ami asked, eyes narrowing a bit.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Makoto said after a moment&#39;s thought.

&quot;Ran Tsukikage,&quot; Ami said almost instantly as Makoto
gazed at her in surprise.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Makoto declared as the name seemed to strike a
chord deep within her, &quot;How did you know?!&quot;

Ami took off her glasses, her expression troubled,
&quot;Because I&#39;ve been having similar dreams, I think.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; most of the group asked at the same time.

Ami rubbed at her eyes, &quot;The context is different, but
when Makoto was describing her dream there was a eerie
familiarity to it.&quot;

&quot;What did you look like?&quot; Makoto had to ask.

&quot;Kimono, black hair pinned up,&quot; Ami recalled, &quot;I
think... I worked in a rice bowl caf&eacute;.&quot;

&quot;Sakura...&quot; Makoto breathed out.

&quot;This is getting just a bit eerie,&quot; MInako said after
a moment.

&quot;Luna,&quot; Usagi gazed at the cat intently, &quot;this isn&#39;t
some negaverse thing, is it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Luna shook her head, &quot;or at least I don&#39;t think
so.&quot;

Artemis looked thoughtful, &quot;Luna, are you thinking
what I&#39;m thinking?&quot;

&quot;I think so Brain,&quot; Usagi murmured, &quot;but where are we
going to get peanut butter and a rubber hose?&quot;

&quot;Usagi,&quot; Rei frowned. Under her breath she added,
&quot;Remind me not to lend you my Animaniacs collection
again.&quot;

Usagi pouted, &quot;Meanie!&quot;

&quot;I think I know what Artemis is guessing,&quot; Luna said
with a long suffewring look, &quot;all of your are
reincarnates from the Moon Kingdom.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Minako said casually, &quot;we know this.&quot;

&quot;But is this the only time you&#39;ve been reincarnated?&quot;
Artemis suggested smugly.

There was a moment of dead silence. &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought
of that,&quot; Ami conceded, taking off her glasses and
cleaning the lenses. &quot;Are you saying that for some
reason Makoto and I are remembering a past life?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s certainly possible,&quot; Artemis said firmly, &quot;and
it&#39;s likely that the spirits of the Moon Kingdom would
be drawn together.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s kinda cool,&quot; Minako conceded. She looked
thoughtful, &quot;But why are only Makoto and Ami
remembering?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s harder to guess,&quot; Luna admitted.

After a bit more debate they ultimately dropped the
subject with Luna and Artemis promising to research
more, and the study session continued on as normal. A
few hours later they broke up, each one heading home.
Ami descended the shrine steps, somehow not surprised
to see Makoto waiting at the bottom for her.

&quot;You mind if I walk you home?&quot; Makoto offered gently.

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Ami admitted as they fell into step
together. &quot;It&#39;s strange,&quot; Ami said after a moment,
&quot;knowing that we knew each other in another life.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Makoto said as she walked close to Ami&#39;s
side, her stance unconsciously protective, &quot;and I
didn&#39;t even mention the odd stuff.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ami looked up at her, the setting sun coloring
her face purple and rose.

&quot;Promise you won&#39;t laugh?&quot; Makoto grinned, waiting
till Ami nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve been dreaming fragments of what
I thought were historical novels, the most recent
being in World War Two. The oldest...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;Ami prompted her gently, looking up at the
beautiful young woman who was walking beside her.

With a blush Makoto admitted, &quot;I&#39;m running around what
I think is Europe in a leather and steel uniform,
fighting mythical beasts with a disc weapon.&quot;

&quot; A chakram,&quot; Ami had a oddly distant look on her
face, &quot;and you had a partner.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Makoto blinked at her in surprise. &quot;You,
too...?&quot;

&quot;I had a staff,&quot; Ami said softly, &quot;then sais... we
fought side by side.&quot;

&quot;Until I died,&quot; Makoto said softly, &quot;and even after.&quot;

Ami hesitated, then reached out to take Makoto&#39;s hand.
&quot;It&#39;s comforting,&quot; she said wryly, &quot;in a eerie sort of
way, to know you&#39;ve always been by my side.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Makoto agreed. A faint blushed appeared on
her face as she suddenly recalled certain details of
that other life.

Ami saw that blush and fought back a impish smile.
Once she sorted through all the memories and confusion
she was feeling, she and Makoto were going to have a
lot to talk about.

End

Notes: What Makoto is remembering/dreaming at first is
the end of the first episode of Tsukikage Ran, more or
less. The final bit is, of course, from Xena Warrior
Princess. This is a &quot;first draft&quot; as I intend to
expand on it later.</pre>
