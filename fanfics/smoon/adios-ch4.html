<h1>Con Su Adios, Usted Toma Con Usted Mi Co (part 4 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Things had been going very badly for the senshi. With the recent 
capture of Tuxedo Kamen, aka Mamoru, both Usagi and Rei had slipped 
into a slight depression. Usagi the worst of the two. The group had 
finally found their Princess and it had been klutzy, whineing Usgai 
the entire time. 

During their battles with Kunzite, Mitsuakai and Yung Hu had proven 
themselves as great allies. However things became rocky whenever 
Mitsuakai and Venus were too close to one another. All Venus had to do 
was speak to her, and Mitsuakai&#39;s eyes would become very cold and 
distant. She would then take her leave from the Senshi&#39;s company, Yung 
Hu following her after apologizing for her actions. 

Things between Makoto and the Senshi were also very stressed. Usagi 
and Rei had no problems with Makoto. However, Ami and Minako did. 
Minako seemed afraid of Makoto, pulling into herself and refusing to 
speak to Makoto. If she did, she would blush and stumble over her 
words. 

Ami was just as bad. She would also pull into herself and hide behind 
a book. Except, unlike Minako, Ami avoided Makoto at all costs if she 
could. refusing to speak with her or to her. Makoto knew why, but 
refused to adress it with the blue haired girl.

################### 

Usagi laid with her head in her arms, the musical locket which Tuxedo 
Kamen had given to her, laying in front of her and playing its soft 
tune. Although it was meant to be a love song to bring one happiness, 
it was now a reminder to Usagi of what all she had lost and yet to 
gain... 

&quot;Usa-chan?&quot; 

Usagi lifted her eyes from the locket to her door, and saw another 
blonde&#39;s head poking inside the door frame. 

&quot;Hi, Mina-chan,&quot; Usagi ishged then diverted her eyes back tot he 
locket. 

&quot;May I come in, Usagi,&quot; Minako asked, opening the door slightly. Usagi 
nodded numbly and Minako entered her friend&#39;s room and closed the door 
behind her. Minako walked behind her new Princess and sat on the 
girl&#39;s bed, looking at her back. &quot;How are you today, Usagi?&quot; 

&quot;Like shit...&quot; 

Minako raised an eye brow. She had never heard Usagi curse before. She 
smirked a bit. &quot;Pretty talk....Do you have to be so crude?&quot; 

Usagi shrugged and sighed. &quot;Gomen ne.&quot; 

Minako reached her hand out and took one of Usagi&#39;s pig tails and 
began running her fingers thru it to brush it. &quot;Know what, Usa-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Hm?&quot; 

&quot;Maybe you should change your hair style for a while,&quot; Minako offered. 
&quot;Try to be someone else for a while and get your mind off of things.&quot; 
Minako stood and walked to Usagi&#39;s vanity and picked up the girl&#39;s 
brush and came back to sit behind her friend again. 

Holding the brush handle in her mouth, Minako leaned over and began to 
undo Usagi&#39;s odangos. After her hair was down, Mianko began to brush 
her friend&#39;s hair out. Usagi smiled and leaned up from the table 
sighing a little bit. Minako smiled and continued to brush her 
friend&#39;s hair. 

&quot;You should go to that new hair salon in town, Usa-chan,&quot; Minako said. 
&quot;See what they can do to your hair.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to go all alone...&quot; 

&quot;No problem. I can go with you, if you like,&quot; Minako offered, placing 
the brush next to her on the bed. Usagi smiled a little and nodded. 

&quot;Alright...&quot;

############# 

Minako smiled as the hair dresser took Usagi from her. *This is 
exactly what Usagi needs* Minako thought to herself. *Complete 
distraction.* 

Minako walked back over to the door and sat on one in one of the empty 
seats. She crossed her legs and placed her hands in her lap,her mind 
drifting away from helping Usagi and to another girl. Her brow 
furrowed as she thought about Makoto more and more. She and Makoto had 
not been able to have a decent conversation...Come to think of it, 
they had yet to actually have a conversation. Makoto had turned her 
back on Minako completly since that day at the temple. 

Minako sighed and leaned over to get a magazine from the table in 
front of her. She sat back up and began to flip thru the pages. *I 
don&#39;t blame her one bit for not speaking to me. I took off...I&#39;d 
probably feel the same way towards her had she done the same to me.* 

&quot;Excuse me, miss.&quot; Minako looked up at to see a woman who worked at 
the salon standing in front of her smiling. &quot;I believe you&#39;re next, 
ma&#39;am.&quot; 

Minako blinked and then smiled. &quot;Oh, no. I&#39;m waiting for a friend.&quot; 

&quot;Well, how about you let me steam your hair? It will make it even more 
soft and shiner than it is. And, its free,&quot; the woman replied with an 
even larger smile. 

Minako thought about it a few moments before uncrossing her lags and 
standing. &quot;Alright.&quot; The woman smiled more. 

&quot;Follow me...&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;...Tuxedo Kamen...&quot; The caped man turned his attention to the senshi 
clad in red. &quot;Have you...returned to help us?&quot; 

His eyes narrowed as she spoke, his mind trying to understand why she 
was asking such things. 

&quot;Iie,&quot; Sailor Venus said. &quot;He isn&#39;t part of us any more. He&#39;s helping 
the dark side. That youma was taking orders from him.&quot; Venus settled 
her gaze on Tuxedo Kamen. &quot;He can&#39;t be trusted!&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s right,&#39; Tuxedo Kamen confirmed. &quot;I am your enemy. And I want 
that ginnzuishou. And I want it now!&quot; He steped forward, pulling his 
cane from behind his back and exrending it. &quot;And I don&#39;t care how I 
have to get it. I will not leave without it.&quot; As he began to advance 
them again, he stopped. The senshi watched as emotions played over his 
face. After a few moments, he turned his attentions abck to the 
senshi. 

&quot;You got lucky this time,&quot; he said, stepping backward towards a portal 
that had opened behind. &quot;But next time, I will not be so leinant.&quot; The 
darkness swept over him as the portal closed. 

Sailor Moon bowed her head. &quot;Mamo-chan...&quot; 

&quot;LOOK OUT!!&quot; The senshi quickly turned and nearly escaped. How could 
they had forgotten about the youma!? 

The senshi scattered, circleing the youma who now had a crazed look in 
it&#39;s eyes. It lashed out at the senshi, keeping them too busy to dodge 
attacks to strike out against it. 

The youma wouldn&#39;t stop its attacks against the senshi. It knew if it 
kept lashing out, it would eventually get one of them. 

Venus rolled away from an attack and quickly stood up. Going into a 
fighting stance, she threw her hands to her sides. &quot;Venus love 
chain...&quot; 

The youma turned its hed and saw Venus powering up to do an attack. It 
growledand began to advance her fast. Just as Venus was about to shout 
out the rest of her attack, the youma aproached her and swung its arm, 
catching Venus in her ribs. Venus fell to the ground, the Youma 
standing above her. 

Venus saw the youma raise it&#39;s arm, which still had the giant buzz 
razor on it, aiming for her stomache. Venus held her ribs and closed 
her eyes tightly, curling up slightly, waiting for the impact to hit 
her. 

Somewhere in the back of her mind, she could hear her friends cry out 
for her to move. Venus wanted to...she knew if that blade came down 
and it hit her...it would kill her. Tears began to run from her 
tightly closed eyes.... 

She felt a brush of wind against her body, but felt no impact. She 
slowly opened her eyes and saw a pair of legs cad in army pants and 
boots standing beside her. Slowly gazing up, she saw Mitsuakai 
standing there, her eyes glowing a bright green. Her arms were crossed 
above her head, the razor slicing into her arms. Mitsuakai didn&#39;t seem 
to notice. The youma pressed its weight harder into Mitsuakai, making 
the warrior&#39;s wounds deeper. She flinched slightly, her face beaded 
with sweat. 

Venus quickly stood, her eyes still fixated on Mitsuakai&#39;s face. *I 
don&#39;t get it....I thought she hated me??* 

Sensing Venus&#39;s eyes on her, Mitsuakai blinked and turned her face 
slightly, her normal emerald eyes showing thru. Her face was 
emotionless, but her eyes seemed to plead with Venus, asking for 
forgivness for how she had treated the girl. When Venus nodded 
slightly, Mitsuakai smiled slightly then turned her head back towards 
the youma. 

Throwing her arms up, Mitsuakai forced the youma to back off slightly. 
Mitsuakai then drew her hand back and threw it forward, the palm of 
her hand landing on the youma&#39;s stomache. Her hand began to glow and 
electircty flowed thru her hand and into the youma, making it fall 
forward. 

Venus looked over at Sailor Moon. &quot;Now!!&quot; 

The Princess nodded and pointed her moon wand at the fallen youma. 
&quot;Moon healing escalation!&quot; The demon cried out in pain before 
reverting back to it&#39;s normal human form. 

The senshi then turned back to Mitsuakai. Her green slender arms were 
now stained red from the blood that had poured from her wounds. Venus 
came to stand next to the winged warrior. 

&quot;Arigato, Mitsuakai-san,&quot; Venus said bowing slightly. 

Mitsuakai blinked a few moments. When Venus straightened up, their 
eyes locked and for a split second, Venus thought she knew who she 
was. She looked down at the ground, trying to figure out who she may 
be. 

Mitsuakai blinked and then nodded her head. &quot;You&#39;re welcome, Sailor 
Venus.&quot; 

Venus&#39;s head snapped up at the sound of Mitsuakai&#39;s voice. They&#39;re 
eyes locked a second time. And that time, Venus knew who she was... 

Who could know the emptiness inside 
Every time I see your face 
Too many feelings left behind 
Do you wonder why 
I turn away when you look at me 
Never wanting your eyes to see 
This desperate heart that knows 
How perfect we could be 
Baby cause you don&#39;t know, how I feel 
Livin&#39; my life without you 
Baby and you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like 
Lovin&#39; you all this time 
I&#39;ll give you all my love, heart and soul 
Riskin&#39; it all on a chance 
Now when I need you the most, You don&#39;t know 

&quot;I can&#39;t believe it...I just do NOT believe it!&quot; Minako paced her 
room, her mind flooded from scences from the night before during the 
battle. &quot;Its her. I can&#39;t believe its her!&quot; 

Artemis sat on his and Minako&#39;s bed, watching the young woman pace. 
&quot;Minako, what are you babbeling about?&quot; 

&quot;It all makes sense now,&quot; Minako said, not even hearing Artemis. &quot;Why 
she was so bitter towards me during our battles...I get it now!!&quot; 

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t and I wish you&#39;d explain it,&quot; Artemis said, slightly 
annoyed. 

Minako finally looked at her gaurdian and shook her head. &quot;Gomen ne, 
Arty. I can&#39;t talk, I gotta run!!&quot; And with that, Minako ran from her 
room and out of her apartment. 

Artemis just sat there, a large sweatdrop on his head. &quot;Can&#39;t talk,&quot; 
he said to him self out loud. &quot;For the past hour...thats all that girl 
has done...&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

The bell to the Crown Arcade jinngled when Minako opened the door and 
stepped inside. She took a quick glance around and found Ami and Rei 
huddeled aroound Usagi as she played a video game. She smiled as she 
approached them. 

&quot;Omaesan, minna-chan,&quot; Minako greeted as she joined her friends. &quot;What 
are you guys doing?&quot; 

&quot;Tojikomeru,&quot; Usagi groweled at Minako. &quot;I&#39;m trying to win this 
freakin thing!&quot; 

The girls sweatdropped. Rei leaned over to Minako and whispered into 
her ear. &quot;Usagi is trying to beat my high score. Loser buys lunch for 
everyone.&quot; 

Minako smiled and shook her head. &quot;You two need to grow up. Do we have 
a booth yet? I want to sit down.&quot; 

Rei nodded towards a booth in back. &quot;Over there,&quot; she said. &quot;The one 
Makoto is sitting at. She&#39;s saving it for us.&quot; 

Minako looked over towards the booth, deciding if she really wanted to 
be alone with the amazon or not. Finally deciding to go, she waved to 
the girls and walked over to the booth. 

When she got there, Makoto remined Minakop of Aim; she had her nose 
shoved in a book. Minako cleared her throat and Makoto looked up. 
Minako&#39;s eyes nearly fell out of her head. Makoto was wearing glasses! 

&quot;May I sit down,&quot; Minako asked, being polite. 

Makoto smiled at her and nodded, her gaze going back to the book in 
her hands. Minako sat down across from her old friend and studied the 
book in her hands. A photograhy book. 

The two sat there a few moments, not speaking to one another. Minako 
sat there, her hands in her lap, ideling playing with the hem of her 
summer dress. As the silence grew, Minako began to wonder if she and 
Makoto would ever become close friends again. 

&quot;Its nice to see you haven&#39;t changed much, Mina-chan,&quot; Makoto said 
with out looking up from her book. Minako jerked her head up, smiling 
to herself. That had been the first real thing Makoto had said to her 
without being cold and distant. 

Minako nodded. &quot;Thank you, Mako-ch...Makoto-san.&quot; Minako dared not to 
press her luck right now. 

Makoto raised her eyes, looking over her glasses and the book and 
smiled before closing the book and removing her glasses. &quot;You can call 
me &#39;Mako-chan&#39; if you want to, Mina-chan.&quot; Minako nodded and smiled 
slightly. &quot;Gomen ne for how I&#39;ve treated you these past few weeks, 
Minako. I&#39;ve had a lot on my mind.&quot; 

&quot;I understand, Mako-chan.&quot; Makoto smiled more as did Minako. It felt 
good to call her friend by her old name. Thats when Minako noticed 
what Makoto was wearing. &quot;Mako-chan...why are you wearing long sleeves 
on such a warm day?&quot; 

Makoto smiled a bit and shrugged. &quot;I have my reasons.&quot; 

Minako&#39;s mind flooded with the memories of the battle from last night. 
&quot;Can I see your arms, Mako-chan?&quot; 

Makoto looked at her quizically. &quot;Nani? Naze?&quot; 

Minako blinked and her face turned a slight shade of crimson. 
&quot;I...uh...I just want to see your arms.&quot; 

Makoto laughed and shook her head. &quot;Alright,&quot; she said, rolling up her 
sleeves. 

There was nothing there. 

No scars, cuts, stiches, bandages...Nothing. Just skin. Minako&#39;s eyes 
fell to the table. She knew Makoto was Mitsuaki. She just knew it with 
in her heart. Makoto smiled and and rolled her sleeves back down her 
arms. 

&quot;Happy now, Mina-chan,&quot;Makoto asked, smirling slightly. 

Minako shook her head. &quot;Iie. Not really. I was hopeing...&quot; Minako 
sighed. &quot;Never mind. I thought you were someone else.&quot; 

Makoto nodded in understanding. &quot;Perk up. Here come the girls.&quot; Mianko 
looked up and saw Usagi, rei, and Ami walking towards them. Usagi and 
Rei were fighting like usual. 

&quot;I won, Odango! You have to pay for lunch!&quot; 

&quot;You lost, Pyro! By a thousand points. *YOU* have to pay!!&quot; Ami, 
Makoto, and Minako sweatdropped. 

Makoto stood from the booth seat to allow Usagi and Rei to sit down. 
When Ami took a look at where she&#39;d be sitting, she quickly grabbed 
her things. 

&quot;Gomen ne, minna,&quot; she said. &quot;But I have to go study for a test in 
math. See you later.&quot; She quickly turned and walked to the doors of 
the arcade and walking out of them. Makoto just stood there, her eyes 
following Ami until the wall came between them. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; she said, quickly following Ami. The three girls 
just blinked and shrugged, not knowing what was going on. 

Makoto caught up with Ami just as she was crossing the street. Makoto 
grabbed her arm and spun her around to look at her. 

Ami became in furiated. &quot;What in Kami-smam&#39;s name do you think you&#39;re 
doing!?&quot; 

&quot;I want to know what in the hell I&#39;ve done to piss you off, Ami-san,&quot; 
Makoto said bluntly. &quot;Ever since we met, you have not said one kind 
word to me if not one word at all! And all I have done is show you 
kindness. Why!?&quot; 

Ami blinked back the tears in her eyes swallowed, her mouth very dry 
now. Shaking her head, she jerked her arm away. &quot;I do not like nor 
aprove of gays. Therefor, I do not like you.&quot; 

Makoto sighed in frustration as she watched Ami walk away from her. 
She bowed her head and placed her hands in her pockets. Her suspions 
had been correct. Ami was a homophop. 

She sighed and brought one hand up to her head. She began to walk back 
to the arcade when she heard screeching tires coming from behind 
her... 

All I ever wanted in this world 
Baby I found in you 
I never felt this way before 
But I can&#39;t break through 
And now I lie awake, alone at night 
So afraid now to close my eyes 

Just one more dream of you 
I&#39;ll carry here inside 
Baby cause you don&#39;t know, how I feel 
Livin&#39; my life without you 
Baby and you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like 
Lovin&#39; you all this time 
I&#39;ll give you all my love, heart and soul 
Riskin&#39; it all on a chance 
Now when I need you the most, You don&#39;t know 

Minako, Usga and Rei sat in the waiting room of the hospital, waiting 
for the sugeon to come out of surgery to let them know how Makoto was. 
The three were crying, but none as bad as Minako. 

Minako had her head resting on Rei&#39;s shoulder, crying her eyes out. 
Usagi and Rei weren&#39;t sure why this had affected her as intensly as it 
had, but dared not to ask. Rei had her arm around Minako, trying to 
comfort her friend. 

The girls had still been in the arcade when the accident had occured. 
They wouldn&#39;t have known had someone not run in from the street, 
yelling at Motoki to call an ambulance because someone had been hit by 
a car. 

The girls had all looked at one another before jumping up and running 
out to see who it had been... 

A witness to the accident had claimed, a car had turned the cornor 
without stopping, slamming into Makoto from behind. Makoto had then 
hit the windsheild and flipped over top the car, laying face down and 
unmoving, her blood begining to pool around her. 

That was the image that had greeted the girls when they were finally 
able to get thru the crowd to see. Minako screamed like her life 
depended on it, but Usagi and Rei had held her back from running to 
Makoto&#39;s aid, them wanting to do the same. 

Minako snapped out of her thoughts when Rei tapped her shoulder, 
alerting her that the docter had entered the room. It was Ami&#39;s 
mother. 

Dr. Mizuno bowed, her face, although calm, was very stressed. &quot;I was 
able to stableize her,&quot; Dr Mizuno said. The girls sighed in relief 
slightly. &quot;However, she has slipped into a coma. I&#39;m not sure if 
she&#39;ll ever come out of it. If she does, she may have brain damage or 
loss of memory. The next 48 hours are critical to see if she even 
pulls through. I am surprised she&#39;s made it this far.&quot; 

Minako&#39;s tears had returned, full force. Maktoto....die? The image of 
burying her friend could not and would not register in her mind. Rei 
held her friend tightly as her own tears poured down her face. Usgai, 
also crying, walked over to sit on the other side of Minako to hold 
her tightly as well. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Dr. Mizuno said. &quot;I have done all I can...&quot; 

And I would hold you all through the night 
I would stay right by your side 
And I&#39;d give you the world if your love was mine 
But baby could it be I&#39;m only dreamin&#39; 
Don&#39;t let it pass me by 
Baby cause you don&#39;t know, how I feel 
Livin&#39; my life without you 
Baby and you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like 
Lovin&#39; you all this time 
I&#39;ll give you all my love, heart and soul 
Riskin&#39; it all on a chance 
Now when I need you the most, You don&#39;t know</pre>
