<h1>Power Transcendent (part 5 of 31)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessica.html">Jessica</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/powertrans-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Tuesday. And Minako was going a little stir crazy. Yesterday, after she 
and Ami had finished their study session, Minako had gone straight home 
and spent the rest of the day moping about in a most pathetic way. Even 
Artemis had gotten fed up after awhile and had left to spend some time 
with Luna and Diana. She was determined not to do *that* again today.

&quot;It&#39;s not like we&#39;re joined at the hip, right?&quot; She muttered to herself 
as she put the finishing touches in her hair before leaving for school. 
&quot;I can get through a few days without hanging out with Ami! I mean, 
after Friday she won&#39;t need to study with me anymore, and things will 
probably just go back to normal.&quot; That was a rather depressing prospect, 
and not one Minako was ready to deal with yet.

In all honesty, everything they were doing at this point was pretty much 
review anyway. Ami had learned virtually everything Minako had to teach. 
And Minako had learned quite a bit from Ami in the process. She had no 
worries about Ami&#39;s performance in the next practice exam.

She sighed again. &quot;She doesn&#39;t need me anymore...&quot; At that moment, the 
bell rang. She peeked out the window. &quot;Well, speak of the devil.&quot; Ami 
was standing there, smiling up at her. And in what had become the usual 
fashion, Artemis hopped down on her shoulders to say hello. Minako 
smiled at she looked down, a smile not at all feigned. As much as she 
might worry about their relation...their friendship when they were 
apart, when she and Ami were together it was hard for Minako to be 
anything but happy. 

She came downstairs and greeted Ami at the door, who responded with a 
smile that had a touch of concern to it. &quot;Are you feeling up for school 
today?&quot; She asked. &quot;Artemis was just telling me that you closed yourself 
in your room after we said good bye yesterday and didn&#39;t come out.&quot; 
 
Minako glared at Artemis, who suddenly looked rather frightened and 
found a passing dust mote to be fascinating. &quot;Artemis needs to mind his 
own business!&quot; She said brightly, turning back to Ami with a warm smile. 
Artemis sighed deeply in relief. &quot;I&#39;m fine, Ami-chan. I just...wasn&#39;t 
feeling too well yesterday. But I&#39;m absolutely fine now.&quot;

As they started down the street for school, Minako glanced back at 
Artemis with a look that promised retribution. The white cat wilted. 
&quot;Maybe I should see how Luna&#39;s doing today...&quot; He muttered to himself. 
&quot;Like, for the entire day...maybe the whole week.&quot;

Ami took a deep breath and let it out, noticing the wisps of vapor that 
came out as she did so. &quot;It&#39;s getting colder.&quot; She noted. &quot;It might snow 
early this year.&quot;

Minako smiled. &quot;Good...I like snow. I think it&#39;s beautiful.&quot;  
 
&quot;So do I.&quot; Ami agreed in a soft voice. They walked along in silence for 
a few minutes. &quot;So, what did you have planned for today?&quot; 
 
&quot;Well, I guess you still have to head back to crunching numbers after we 
finish studying?&quot; 
 
Ami made a rueful face. &quot;I&#39;m afraid so...but it&#39;s going more quickly 
than I thought it would. I might have a few likely spots by the end of 
the day. And once I have a couple, finding the others should be much 
easier.&quot;

The blonde girl nodded. &quot;That&#39;s good...&quot; She sighed. &quot;Well, I haven&#39;t 
been to Crown for awhile...maybe I&#39;ll see if Usagi wants to come with 
me.&quot;

&quot;Somehow, I don&#39;t think Usagi would be against a little trip to an 
arcade.&quot; Ami noted with a giggle. 

Minako smiled in return. &quot;Probably not!&quot; There was a certain awkwardness 
to this conversation that hadn&#39;t been there before. There were too many 
things going unsaid, Minako decided. She wanted to tell Ami how much 
she had missed her yesterday. She wanted to tell her that she wanted to 
keep spending time with her, even after they didn&#39;t need to study 
together anymore. 

-But would she think that was weird? Would she even want to spend that 
much time with me anymore? She&#39;s always been a solitary person...she 
might be getting tired of all the company.- Minako shook her head and 
sighed deeply. 

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re alright Minako-chan?&quot; Ami asked. 

&quot;Oh, yeah. I&#39;m sure.&quot; She smiled and winked. &quot;Just a little tired, I 
guess.&quot; 

Ami smiled and nodded. The remainder of their short walk passed in 
silence. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll see you after school, right?&quot; She asked as they 
reached the high school building. 

Minako nodded. &quot;Of course!&quot; She said with a cheery smile and a wave. She 
dashed off too quickly to see the faintly worried frown that appeared on 
Ami&#39;s face at her rapid retreat.

------------------

Yet another cavern, this one a low chamber with a twisted, abstract 
shape. It was well-lit from shining lamps in the ceiling, but there were 
many nooks and crannies lost in inky black shadow where light could not 
reach. 

Muon gradually appeared in the rough center of this room, his body 
slowly solidifying like mist into ice. He looked around carefully. 
Abruptly his eyes narrowed and he spun around, making his robes billow 
around him as he raised his left palm and created an aura of blue light 
around it. A slim knife clattered off his hand and fell to the ground 
harmlessly. He peered into the dark corner from whence the knife came. 

&quot;Tachyon.&quot; He said in his accustomed monotone. 

A small violet light appeared in the darkness. &quot;I knew you&#39;d catch it, 
Muon.&quot; A tiny voice giggled. &quot;You&#39;re so much fun to play with.&quot;

&quot;I have something to ask you, Tachyon.&quot; The violet point of light 
expanded, illuminating the small figure in the shadows. Tachyon appeared 
to be a beautiful child, perhaps eight years old, though Muon knew for a 
fact she had had that appearance for many, many years now. Her skin was 
like flawless porcelain, and her face was absolutely angelic. Her light 
purple hair streamed out behind her, almost touching the ground as she 
walked. 

She wore black stockings under a sheer purple skirt that spread very 
slightly around her, with a split up the front that revealed her legs to 
just past her knees. Above that, she had on a vest of the same color of 
the skirt that hugged her tightly and left her shoulders and arms bare. 
Her hands were encased in black gloves that extended to just past her 
elbows. 

She was peering down at her hands, cupped around the gleaming point of 
violet light that illuminated her corner. &quot;Lady Meson said I should keep 
my mind on my duties.&quot; She said in a soft, singsong tone. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t 
let me help poor Gluon.&quot;

&quot;But will you help me?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes...&quot; Tachyon replied, raising her head. Her large, lavender eyes 
glittered with a barely restrained madness. &quot;Lord Hadron told me to 
always help you however I could. So I will.&quot; 

Muon nodded a bit. &quot;Tell me...&quot; He made a waving motion with his hand, 
and a map of Tokyo appeared before him. Tachyon stood and stepped 
lightly over to look at it curiously. The child&#39;s powers of time were 
impressive, if rather unpredictable. It was their uncontrollable nature 
that kept her body and spirit forever restrained to a child&#39;s form. And 
it was that imprisonment that had broken her mind, filling her with a 
frustrated, never ending rage.

Such things, however, were of no real concern to Muon. &quot;Tell me.&quot; He 
repeated. &quot;Where should I attack to bring the one called Sailor Saturn 
out of hiding tomorrow?&quot;

Tachyon looked at the map for a long moment. Her eyes unfocused as her 
mind wandered through the eddies of the timestream. Her small hand 
lifted, and her hand came down on the map at a particular point. &quot;Here.&quot; 
She said absently. &quot;She will appear if you attack here...though she will 
not be alone.&quot;

Muon took note of the location and nodded. &quot;You said I would make my 
greatest discovery upon this world. Will this lead me to it?&quot; 
 
&quot;Yes...but there are many bends in the path...I can&#39;t see...where...&quot; 
Her eyes focused again and she smiled brightly. &quot;That&#39;s all.&quot; Muon 
nodded, and Tachyon knelt down to pick up her knife. &quot;The Sailor Senshi 
are so pretty...&quot; She murmured. &quot;Are they truly strong?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Muon replied. 

&quot;Good...&quot; Tachyon giggled, lightly drawing one gloved finger over the 
knife&#39;s blade. &quot;I hope Lord Hadron will let me play with them...my other 
toys break so easily...&quot; Still giggling mindlessly, she vanished again 
into the shadows of the room. A moment later, Muon faded away. 

He had much to do.

------------------

Ami&#39;s apartment was unusually quiet, given its current inhabitants. 
Normally Ami and Minako chatted and laughed as they helped each other 
study. But today, both were quietly going over their respective 
assignments, asking only occasional questions and receiving short, to 
the point answers.  

Finally, Ami set down her English book and looked over at Minako until 
the blonde Senshi felt her eyes and looked up as well. &quot;Minako-
chan...are you upset with me?&quot;

Minako blinked in surprise. &quot;Upset?&quot; She shook her head emphatically. 
&quot;Of course not, Ami-chan. Why would I be?&quot;

Ami looked worried. &quot;You&#39;re just...different today. I know something&#39;s 
upsetting you. But I don&#39;t know what.&quot; She tilted her head. &quot;Can you 
tell me what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Minako paused for a long moment. &quot;I guess I...&quot; She sighed. &quot;No, I 
can&#39;t.&quot; At Ami&#39;s hurt look, she winced and shook her head. &quot;Please don&#39;t 
take it like that. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust you or anything, I 
promise.&quot; -I don&#39;t think so, anyway.- Her mind chimed in unhelpfully. &quot;I 
just don&#39;t understand what&#39;s wrong myself.&quot; There, that was honest 
enough. 

Ami thought that over for a moment. &quot;I think I understand.&quot; 

&quot;I wish you could explain it to me then.&quot; Minako chuckled softly, 
drawing a smile out of her blue-haired friend. She smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll tell 
you what...as soon as I figure this out, I&#39;ll talk to you about it. I 
just need some more time to think. Okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Ami said, smiling shyly. She took a deep breath and stretched. 
&quot;Well, I guess we&#39;re not going to get much work done today, are we?&quot; 
 
Minako shrugged and smirked. &quot;No...I guess not.&quot; She kicked her feet out 
a bit. 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go on to the arcade, Minako-chan?&quot; Ami said gently. &quot;I 
need to get back to work.&quot;

Minako opened her mouth to speak, then sighed and shook her head. &quot;Maybe 
that would be a good idea.&quot; She finally said. She stood up and gathered 
her things before heading to the door. 

&quot;Minako-chan.&quot; Ami&#39;s voice stopped her as she placed her hand on the 
knob. &quot;I want you to be able to talk to me about what&#39;s bothering you. 
And I want to do the same with you.&quot; 

Remembering Artemis&#39; words, Minako turned back to Ami with a geniune 
smile. &quot;I want that too, Ami-chan.&quot; Ami smiled back just as warmly, and 
Minako let herself out.

Once out on the street, Minako sighed as her feet led her towards Crown 
Arcade. &quot;I do want that.&quot; She said to herself. &quot;But how can I be sure 
that&#39;s really what she wants? I don&#39;t want to bother her...but I don&#39;t 
want to ditch her either. She&#39;s always too nice and too shy to speak up 
if something&#39;s annoying her...and I really don&#39;t want to do that. But I 
don&#39;t want to go back to the way things were, either.&quot;

She continued cycling the problem in her mind as she walked, going over 
the same series of points over and over, unable to reach a conclusion. 
When she arrived at the Arcade, she saw Usagi already there, along with 
Makoto. The two were taking turns with the new Sailor V game, of course. 
&quot;Hi Usagi-chan, hi Mako-chan!&quot; She waved. 

&quot;Hey Minako-chan.&quot; Makoto smiled as she saw the other girl. Usagi was 
too engrossed in the game to reply. &quot;Want to play after Usagi?&quot;  
 
Minako shook her head. &quot;No...I think I&#39;m going to race for a little 
while.&quot;  
 
Makoto nodded. &quot;Sure...&quot; She smiled oddly at Minako, who smiled back 
uncertainly, not sure what was going on. She decided to forget it and 
just headed towards the racing simulator. She sat behind the wheel, 
inserted a few coins, and started to race.

It was clear early on that this wasn&#39;t going to go well. Normally, she 
was able to use games as a chance to relax and forget about her problems. 
This time, thoughts of Ami kept making her mind wander. She crashed 
several times because she wasn&#39;t even watching the screen, her mind 
miles away on a certain blue-haired Senshi. 

The last time she lost she pounded the steering wheel with her palms and 
sat back angrily. &quot;Not really on your game today, huh?&quot; A deep, familiar 
female voice said from behind her. Minako blinked and turned her head to 
look. Tall, her blonde hair cut short, wearing jeans and a leather 
jacket...Minako was certainly not mistaken.

&quot;Haruka-kun! When did you get back?&quot; 

Haruka took the seat next to Minako&#39;s and dropped a few coins into the 
machine. &quot;This morning. Michiru&#39;s back home taking a nap. I don&#39;t get 
jetlagged, so I thought I&#39;d head here.&quot; She smiled over at the shorter 
girl. &quot;Wanna race?&quot;

Minako grinned and put her hands back on the wheel. &quot;Sure...but don&#39;t 
think you can get away with giving me a head start anymore...you&#39;ll be 
sorry.&quot;

Haruka smirked teasingly. &quot;The way you were just racing, I barely need 
to touch the wheel to beat you.&quot; Minako just glared and slammed her foot 
on the gas when the green light blinked. After just a few minutes, her 
car spun out of control and crashed into a building. Minako shut her 
lips tightly, holding back a muffled scream of frustration and gripped 
the wheel so lightly her fingers turned white. Haruka looked at her in 
surprise and let go of the wheel, folding her arms over her chest and 
looking at Minako.

&quot;You can&#39;t play like that.&quot; She said softly, in a chiding tone. Her 
forgotten car smashed into another and &#39;game over&#39; appeared on the 
screens. &quot;You can&#39;t do anything when you&#39;re this wound up. What&#39;s the 
matter Minako-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;Nothing.&quot; She replied shortly. Haruka just shrugged and closed her eyes, 
settling back against the seat. After a moment, Minako sighed and looked 
around. Usagi and Makoto were still playing, and there was nobody in ear 
shot. &quot;It&#39;s Ami.&quot; She said, staring at the screen. 

&quot;Ami?&quot; Haruka asked. &quot;Setsuna told us how much time you two were 
spending together lately. Did you two have a fight or something?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Minako shook her head. &quot;She...needed my help with something. 
That&#39;s really why we&#39;ve been together so much. But soon, she won&#39;t need 
me anymore. And I don&#39;t want things to go back to the way they were with 
us.&quot; 

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Because...&quot; She closed her eyes and shook her head. There was too much 
there...far more than she was able to deal with now. &quot;Because I think 
we&#39;ve gotten a lot closer. And I don&#39;t just want us to be on the list of 
each other&#39;s friends.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Haruka&#39;s casual, laconic questions were 
irritating Minako for some reason. 

&quot;She&#39;s Ami!&quot; She replied in a short tone. &quot;She&#39;s a solitary girl. I 
don&#39;t think she wants me tagging along with her all day everyday. She 
probably can&#39;t wait to get rid of me!&quot;

Haruka made a small chuckling sounds and Minako bristled. &quot;What?&quot; 
 
&quot;That doesn&#39;t make much sense.&quot; She turned her head to look over at the 
younger girl. &quot;Think back...has Ami ever, ever shown any indication that 
she doesn&#39;t want to be around you?&quot;
 
&quot;I...no.&quot; Minako finally said. 

&quot;In fact, I&#39;ll bet she&#39;s been just the opposite.&quot;  
 
Minako remembered how happy Ami seemed when the two of them were 
togehter, and how sad Ami had looked that day she thought Minako had 
left her at school. &quot;I guess so.&quot; She replied in a thoughtful tone. 

&quot;Hmph. So maybe it&#39;s not Ami that has the problem with the two of you 
together at all. Maybe it&#39;s you. Maybe...you&#39;re scared.&quot;

Minako blinked in surprise. &quot;Scared? Why on earth would I be scared?&quot;  
 
The look Haruka gave her at that was far too piercing for her taste, and 
she quickly looked away. &quot;I wonder...&quot; The older woman said softly, as 
if Minako already knew the answer. Minako squirmed in her seat 
uncomfortably.

Haruka smiled. &quot;Hey, didn&#39;t mean to upset you Minako-chan. But I think 
you need to decide what *you* want to do about Ami. Don&#39;t you?&quot;

Minako sighed a bit. Looking back on it, her worries about Ami seemed 
kind of silly. But why was she still so jumbled up? &quot;Yeah...I guess 
you&#39;re right.&quot; Haruka stood then, and smiled. 

&quot;I guess I&#39;ve been away from home long enough. Think about it, okay 
Minako-chan?&quot; She turned to leave. &quot;Oh...&quot; She turned her head with that 
knowing look again. &quot;And when you decide you need to talk about this 
some more, Michiru and I are always ready.&quot; She slipped quietly out of 
the arcade. Minako wandered back over to where the other two girls were. 

&quot;Hi Minako-chan, how was Haruka?&quot; Usagi asked as she approached. &quot;We 
were too busy playing to talk.&quot; 

Minako smiled. &quot;Oh, she&#39;s fine. She&#39;s still a little tired from her trip, 
I guess.&quot;

&quot;What were you two talking about?&quot; Makoto asked over her shoulder. 

&quot;Nothing much...&quot; Minako blinked. &quot;Hey, when did Motoki get DDR Remix in 
here?&quot; She exclaimed with enthusiasm only half-faked. &quot;It&#39;s about time!&quot; 
She rushed over to the game and began dancing. The other two girls 
watched in bemusement as a crowd formed around the Senshi of Love as she 
proceeded to set a few arcade records. 

------------------

Minako left the arcade a couple of hours later. Talking with Haruka 
actually set her mind at ease about a few things, and she was soon able 
to loosen up. After decimating DDR for awhile, she went back to the 
racing game and did much better, defeating both Makoto and Usagi handily. 
Usagi had had to leave at that point, but Makoto stuck around to watch 
Minako play as her alter ego in the Sailor V game. 

She and Makoto left at about the same time. &quot;So how are things, Minako-
chan?&quot; She brunette Senshi asked. 

Minako grinned. &quot;Great! Did you see me take out that final boss?&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;That&#39;s not really what I meant. I mean, how are you?&quot; 
 
Minako smiled and waved her hand dismissively. &quot;Oh, you know I&#39;m always 
great Mako-chan.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot; Makoto chuckled. &quot;Do you know how Ami&#39;s been? She&#39;s 
been working so hard lately.&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh...&quot; A little quaver crept into Minako&#39;s voice, but her smile didn&#39;t 
crack. &quot;I saw her this afternoon. She&#39;s fine...a little overworked, but 
she&#39;s just fine.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good...&quot; Makoto paused for a long moment, and the two kept on 
walking in silence. &quot;You two sure have been spending a lot of time 
together lately.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...I guess we have.&quot; Minako smiled softly at that. Makoto glanced 
over at her and was able to barely suppress a grin. 

&quot;Been having fun?&quot; 
 
&quot;I have...we have.&quot; Minako took a deep breath. &quot;She&#39;s a really good 
friend.&quot; 

Makoto nodded a bit.  
 
&quot;In fact...&quot; Minako continued. &quot;I think she wanted to talk with me about 
something.&quot; She smiled over at the Senshi of Thunder. &quot;Think you can 
make it home without me?&quot; 
 
Makoto grinned. &quot;I think I&#39;ll be okay.&quot; Makoto continued to grin as she 
watched Minako head up a street that lead to Ami&#39;s apartment building. 
&quot;I knew it!&quot; She whispered gleefully.
 
------------------

Ami was getting a glass of water when the bell rang. Her computer 
continued to process its data of the city quietly. Right now, it only 
needed occasional input from her to gather its finding in a way she 
could use. She glanced at the clock. It was getting sort of late...her 
mother would be home for dinner soon. But then, she wouldn&#39;t ring the 
bell, would she?

When she opened the door, she was surprised to see Minako standing there. 
&quot;Minako-chan!&quot; She stepped aside. &quot;Come on inside.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Minako said. Once she was inside, the two of them looked at 
each other for a long moment. &quot;Um...Haruka and Michiru are back in 
town.&quot; Minako finally offered. 

&quot;Oh...good.&quot; Ami smiled. &quot;We&#39;ll need all of the Senshi together to look 
after all the faultlines.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah...&quot; There was another long pause. &quot;Ami-chan...&quot; Minako took a deep, 
steadying breath. &quot;When your test is over, and you&#39;re finished 
studying...we can still hang out together, right?&quot;

Ami blinked in surprise. &quot;Well...of course!&quot;

Minako looked a little taken aback at her matter-of-fact affirmative. &quot;I 
just worried...I mean...I know you like your privacy and I didn&#39;t want 
to bother you...&quot; She trailed off awkwardly, blushing. 

Ami blinked at her again, then smiled softly, covering her mouth with 
one hand as she began to laugh. Minako looked at her. &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Ami said, giggling happily. &quot;It&#39;s just...was that what had 
you so worried today?&quot; 
 
Minako blushed even deeper. &quot;Well...yes.&quot;

Ami sighed happily and reached over and took Minako&#39;s hand in hers, 
smiling. &quot;Minako-chan...&quot; Minako actually managed to blush a bit deeper 
at that. &quot;Listen...you&#39;ve always been my friend.&quot; 
 
&quot;And you&#39;ve always been my friend, Ami-chan.&quot; 
 
Ami nodded. &quot;Yes...but I&#39;ve really gotten fond of you since we started 
all of this.&quot; She smiled. &quot;There&#39;s really nobody I&#39;d rather hang out 
with than you. You&#39;re my best friend.&quot; She said simply.

Minako&#39;s hand began to tremble very slightly in Ami&#39;s, and Ami released 
it. &quot;You&#39;re my best friend too.&quot; Minako replied in almost a whisper. She 
took a few deep breaths and began to come back to herself, the redness 
in her cheeks fading away. 

&quot;So.&quot; Ami asked in a teasingly severe, maternal tone. &quot;Are you going to 
be okay, Little Miss Minako?&quot;

Minako looked a little more lively as she replied back in a petulant, 
child-like voice. &quot;Oh, I guess...but can I have a cookie too?&quot; 
 
Ami burst out laughing at that, and Minako joined her. When their 
laughter finally subsided, Minako stretched and smiled. &quot;Well, I&#39;d 
better head home.&quot; 
 
&quot;I should get ready for dinner...Mother will be home soon and we&#39;re 
going to make curry together.&quot; 
 
&quot;That must be nice...&quot; Minako said wistfully. Something in her tone 
suddenly made Ami feel rather sad. 

&quot;You&#39;re welcome to stay and help, if you want.&quot; Ami offered. But Minako 
just shook her head. 

&quot;Nah...I don&#39;t want to intrude. And besides, Artemis is such an old lady. 
He must be worrying about me already.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Thanks Ami-chan.&quot; 
Impulsively, she reached out and gave Ami a warm hug. Ami looked 
surprised, but returned it after just a moment. The time began to 
stretch out, and the two slowly started to embrace each other more 
tightly. 

Finally Minako froze. She released her friend as quickly as she could 
without being obvious about it, and both turned their heads to hide the 
flush on both their cheeks. &quot;Well...&quot; Minako said in a voice that shook 
very slightly. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, right?&quot; 
 
&quot;Of course!&quot; Ami replied, that same tremble in her own voice. As soon as 
Minako had closed the door behind her, Ami sped into the kitchen and 
took everything out of the cupboards for dinner with incredible speed 
and efficiency. Then she began chopping vegetables. Her mind was blazing 
in a thousand directions at once initially, but soon she was able to 
drop everything else into the background. 

-Chop chop chop...finished. Chop chop chop. Chop chop chop...finished.- 
There really wouldn&#39;t be too much for Ami&#39;s mother to do at this rate, 
but Ami found the repeating motion of the knife so soothing. An annoying 
voice in the back of her head told her that there was something she 
needed to stop and think about, but she ignored it. There were too many 
complications in her life already.

------------------

Minako rushed out of the apartment building and collapsed into a bus 
stop bench as soon as she could, laughing. She honestly couldn&#39;t 
remember ever feeling this way before. Her hands were shaking, her 
insides felt like jelly, and she just could not stop laughing. 

Ami...how could she have ever imagined anything could be wrong between 
the two of them. Silly Minako. Slowly, her laughter started to subside. 
She felt so incredibly good right now...nothing could bother her. There 
were still issues to be decided, still questions she couldn&#39;t deal with. 
For that matter, there was still a new enemy who could attack at any 
time. They could all be dead tomorrow. 

But none of that mattered. She sprawled back on the bench, a big, goofy 
smile plastered over her face. -Haruka&#39;s right.- She acknowledged to 
herself. -I *am* scared. I don&#39;t know of what, but I am. But I don&#39;t 
care right now.- Right now, the fear welling up inside her was the fear 
of a person on a rollercoaster, slowly coming up that first big hill. 
Terrified, but so very eager to see what happened next. 

Minako heard her stomach rumble, and decided it was probably time for 
her to grab some dinner as well. She stood and headed home, practically 
dancing as she walked.

AUTHORS NOTE: Hi all! I thought I&#39;d try this new format for the notes. 
I&#39;m trying to keep an even pace with things between Ami and Minako...not 
too fast, but not keeping it too slow, either. And of course, it has to 
keep pace with the action of the story! ^_^

Well, keep on reading, and I hope you&#39;re liking it so far. Speaking of 
action...big fight next time...probably the biggest so far!</pre>
