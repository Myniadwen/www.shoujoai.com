<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The show in channel six had started

&quot;Good morning everyone, welcome to STARS EXPOSED! Today is our very, 
very special episode because our guest for today is no ordinary star, 
she is an extraordinary star! We welcome back, Minako Aino!&quot; Anounced 
Tamako

The camera focuses on Minako

&quot;Good morning Minako-san!&quot;

&quot;Good morning Tamako-san!&quot; Greeted Minako

&quot;Wow Minako-san you always look absolutely beautiful, and not to mention 
an equally beautiful voice you posses, how did your manager discovered 
your talent?&quot;

&quot;I was attending my high school back then when I was performing a song 
in our music class for recitation, my instructor and voice teacher&#39;s 
friend; Ms. Wendy Denverland who came from Ireland visited us that very 
same day of my recitation, listened to our performance. Ms. Wendy, who 
happened to be a professional manager, said that I have a great 
potential of becoming a star, she introduced me to the owner of the 
famous recording company in the United Kingdom, Kline Records&quot;

&quot;Then after a year of training, recording and getting ready, my very 
first album was released and my songs became a hit. And I became famous&quot; 
Minako added

&quot;Since you became famous I bet you&#39;ve become very busy with your 
schedule, what do you do when you or if you have your free time?&quot;

&quot;I go love hunting! chuckles Just kidding! I spent my free time talking 
to my family through long distance telephone; I really missed them so 
much, especially my mom. Sometimes my manager and I go shopping. But I 
usually spent my free time sleeping!&quot;

&quot;How about squeezing a time to find a boyfriend?&quot;

&quot;Find a boyfriend? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary. Love is always around 
you. It is just waiting for someone or even waiting for you to express 
it. You will feel it when you think that is the right person&quot; Stated 
Minako

&#39;Hmmm that is a wise quotation from a pop star. No wonder you really are 
a role model to many especially the children&#39;

There was a pause. Role Model? Speaking of being a Lesbian lately...

Minako shrugged

&quot;Come on, I&#39;m not that good. I can be a little evil sometimes. Parents 
are really the ones who should and will always be the primary role 
model. Trust me; my good attitude came from my mother!&quot;

And my Hentai side came from my father! Minako added in her thought then 
smiled

&quot;There&#39;s news that you and your male childhood friend are now a lovely 
pair. Is that true?&quot;

&quot;No! Of course not! He&#39;s my very best friend and will always be. Right, 
Daisuke-chan?&quot; Minako Directly winks and chuckled at the camera to 
deliver the question through television

&quot;Oh, by the way, we just want to tell you that we are deeply sorry for 
what happened yesterday at the Tokyo Hotel because of our fellow media 
men who forced their way to the entrance&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve been scared at first but then I figured that 
someone is going to be there in case it happened again&quot; Minako glimpsed 
at Rei who blushed and looked away

&quot;Minako-san, majority of your fans already knew about your coming 
concert this week. But some of your fans weren&#39;t updated. Would you like 
to inform them about your concert?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Minako looks at the camera

&quot;Everyone is invited to watch my concert at the Tokyo Coliseum this 
Saturday of the week. Hope you all get your tickets at the ticket booths 
and thank you very much for your solid support; I&#39;ll make sure that you 
will enjoy this&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much for squeezing us an interview from your hectic time 
Minako-san!&quot;

&quot;Thank you too, Tamako-san!&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s the end of our live interview with Minako Aino&quot;

The director had finally announced &quot;CUT&quot;. Minako and Tamako stayed at 
the stage couch and chat a little. Minako wished that Tamako would now 
stop talking and interviewing her now that the show had taken a short 
break because she was already getting cold of her outfit.

To Minako&#39;s relief, Wendy interrupted them and reminded Minako of her 
rehearsal this afternoon. Now Tamako&#39;s attention turned to Wendy and she 
started interviewing Minako&#39;s manager. Minako tip-toed her way down to 
the studio stage in able to escape the ever talking Tamako.

Tamako&#39;s questions weren&#39;t that personal but Minako&#39;s now feeling cold 
enough to entertain the host&#39;s questions. She needed to warm her body or 
she&#39;ll catch a cough or cold.

As she finally got out where the area is a little warm she brushes her 
palms on her arms. But that was not enough to warm her because she&#39;s 
feeling her body getting numb in coldness of the studio

Suddenly a pair of familiar strong but gentle hands placed and wrapped a 
rose-scented gray colored garment around her upper body that instantly 
started to warm her body up. She turned to look and thank this kind 
gentleman

But it was not a gentleman that she saw.

&quot;R-Rei?&quot; Minako said surprisingly

&quot;Put that on for a while. You were getting cold, I just noticed...&quot; Rei 
said while she was looking away from Minako. Although the studio is a 
little dark, Minako can tell Rei is blushing

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get Ms. Wendy&quot; Rei tried to change the subject as she 
walks past Minako going to Wendy and Tamako&#39;s direction

&quot;Rei?&quot; Her bodyguard stopped

Rei noticed Minako wasn&#39;t calling her Rei-chan anymore which is a little 
disappointing for Rei. But she turned to face the pop star

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You noticed. Thank you.&quot; Minako smiled at her. Rei could not think of 
things to say to her but

&quot;I...er...You&#39;re welcome...&quot; Was all Rei can release from her mouth. 
Then she led Minako to Wendy&#39;s direction.

------

After the interview, Wendy instructed Rei to drop by at Minako&#39;s concert 
producer&#39;s house to meet up with him. They didn&#39;t expect their meeting 
will be early dismissed because the producer has other meetings to 
attend to. There is still two hours left before attending the concert 
rehearsal

Minako spoke at Wendy

&quot;Ms. Wendy, can we visit my parents? We still have two hours before my 
rehearsal. It only takes fifteen minutes to reach there&quot; Minako asked 
Wendy who replied her with a look of disapproval

&quot;...We will only stay there in fifteen minutes alright?&quot; Wendy said

&quot;Thank you!&quot; Was all that Minako can say and she hugged Wendy again who 
scolded her for strangling her delicate neck

&quot;You heard that Rei-chan? I&#39;ll be seeing my parents again!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure Ms. Wendy would have approved anyway&quot; Opinioned Rei who smiled

They have reached Minako&#39;s house fifteen minutes later. Minako&#39;s home is 
a simple two-storey house; it has flowers and garden plants surrounding 
it.

They stepped at the doorway and Minako knocked three times at the door. 
It opened.

A woman with shoulder-length blond hair and sparkling blue eyes as 
lively as Minako&#39;s opened the door

&quot;Mom!&quot; Greeted Minako

&quot;Mina, you&#39;re here!&quot; Minako&#39;s mother said as they hugged each other. 
They went inside the house; Minako seems excited to see everybody

&quot;We just saw you in T.V. honey; I never thought you&#39;d go straight here 
after the show&quot;

&quot;Actually we just went from Gendou-san, my producer, who happened to 
have another meeting so we were dismissed earlier so I thought I&#39;d drop 
by&quot; Explained Minako

&quot;Oh, so you&#39;ll only be dropping by?&quot; Minako&#39;s mother sound disappointed

&quot;Yeah, I wish I could spend my time here longer,&quot; Minako&#39;s mother looked 
at the other two persons behind her daughter, Minako forgot to introduce 
them

&quot;Oh mom, you remember Ms. Wendy Denverland right?&quot; Minako pointed her 
hand to Wendy, who bowed her head slightly

&quot;And this is Agent Hino Rei, my personal bodyguard here&quot; Rei smiled and 
bowed at Mrs. Aino

&quot;Very well, your father is in the living room. You lead your companions 
there while I prepare you some biscuits and teas&quot; Said Mrs. Aino

&quot;Come on, living room is just straight ahead!&quot; Minako lively said as she 
ran straight to the corridor and enter the living room. She found her 
father reading a newspaper.

Minako cover her hands on her father&#39;s eyes who surprised by his 
intruder

&quot;Wha--? Mommy?&quot; Said Minako&#39;s clueless father

&quot;Guess again! I&#39;ll give you a clue: I&#39;m younger, sexier and as sweet as 
you&quot; Minako giggled as she noticed her father&#39;s smile widen

&quot;My Minako!&quot; Minako took off her hand as her father stood to turn and 
hug her daughter

&quot;I&#39;m so glad you came to see us&quot;

&quot;I really missed you and mom&quot; Said Minako. Then she turned to introduce 
her companions

&quot;Dad, I guess you remember Wendy, my manager. And this is Agent Hino 
Rei, my bodyguard&quot; As Minako pointed Rei, she bowed. Mr. Aino cleared 
his throat then kissed Rei&#39;s hand

&quot; Pleased to meet you, Hino-san. As you can see I&#39;m Minako&#39;s handsome 
father&quot;

Minako slapped her father&#39;s hand

&quot;Easy dad, she&#39;s taken&quot; Minako winked at her bodyguard

Rei sweat dropped and looked at Wendy

&quot;He did the same when we first met, and Minako always slap his hands 
every time he does that&quot; Whispered Wendy who chuckled at Minako&#39;s 
father. Mrs. Aino just got into the living room carrying a tray of 
biscuits and teas

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for the delay, here warm yourselves with tea&quot; Said Mrs. Aino 
as she hand out each a plate of biscuits and a cup of tea. Minako didn&#39;t 
drank the tea but ate her mother&#39;s home made biscuits

&quot;How long are you staying here Mina&quot; Asked Ms. Aino

&quot;We&#39;ll be staying here for a week, after this I&#39;ll be practicing some 
dance steps for the upcoming concert in Saturday&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t you take a break and spend a little vacation here to rest?&quot; Asked 
Mr. Aino

Minako frowned. Mr. Aino can tell it&#39;s a NO, I can&#39;t.

&quot;If you have some free time during your stay here, you can always drop 
by here and have tea, Mina&quot; Mrs. Aino said to change the topic

&quot;Thank you mom, dad&quot; Said an almost crying Minako

&quot;I&#39;m sure Minako will get some free time to visit you&quot; Said Wendy

Minako stood and grabbed Rei&#39;s hand, making her bodyguard stood up too

&quot;Rei-chan come with me, I&#39;ll show you to my room!&quot; Said Minako excitedly

&quot;No way, I can&#39;t do that&quot; Protested Rei

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Ms. Hino, she always show her room to her visitors&quot; Said 
Wendy as she drank her tea

Rei couldn&#39;t protest again especially in Minako&#39;s house with her 
parents. So She let Minako led her upstairs towards her room. Minako 
opened the door of her room

Rei&#39;s heart stopped

Minako&#39;s room is full of stuff toys, each and every one of what she saw 
in the malls she had went to. The walls are painted light blue, pictures 
of young Minako hung from it. Minako&#39;s room was very simple. Too simple 
for a pop star, Rei thought. Minako launched herself at her soft clean 
bed and sat cross-legged; ignoring the fact that she&#39;s wearing a mini 
skirt

&quot;Come Rei-chan, sit here beside me&quot; Minako said as she taps the saved 
position for her

&quot;Okay&quot; Rei approached Minako and slowly sat next to her. They were 
silent for about ten seconds then

&quot;Aino-san?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Rei-chan?&quot;

&quot;Why do you call me in my pet name?&quot; Asked Rei

Minako paused, thinking for a reasonable answer. Rei liked the 
expression of Minako&#39;s face

&quot;It&#39;s because...I don&#39;t know why but I feel close to you. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve 
known you before but I just couldn&#39;t remember when or where...Didn&#39;t you 
like me to call you that?&quot; Frowned Minako

&quot;No-no-no, I like it!&quot; Rei quickly replied to avoid upsetting the pop 
star

&quot;Rei-chan really sounds nice. You&#39;re the only one who always called me 
that&quot; Rei continued as she blushed

&quot;Why? Didn&#39;t your friends call you that?&quot; Asked Minako in disbelief

&quot;My friends usually called me Raven or Hino-chan or just Rei, because I 
grew up doing police training with my uncle. In fact I&#39;m the youngest 
Agent who graduated at the TNPH&quot; Said Rei

&quot;I&#39;ve noticed that too, I have thought you are so young to be a police 
or something&quot; Said Minako

&quot;Sometimes I even thought I&#39;m just wasting my time there&quot; Said Rei who 
is still looking down at the floor

&quot;When I was young I&#39;ve always wanted to be a singer and a star. I was 
thankful that I became both&quot; Minako started again

&quot;You have the potential&quot; Rei commented

&quot;But I haven&#39;t got all I wanted&quot; Said Minako

&quot;Come on, with all these stuffs, your parents, friends and your fame, 
what could a girl ask for more?&quot; Rei said in disbelief

&quot;I want to find the one I truly loved&quot; Minako said with the expression 
like she was dreaming

&quot;And when I do, I want to live forever with this person. That&#39;s where I 
can say that my life has finally completed, that&#39;s all I ever wanted&quot; 
She continued

Rei looked at Minako. She was different. Is this the real Minako Aino? 
Perhaps people really do have a brighter side. And she found Minako&#39;s 
brighter side very fascinating.

&quot;Did your parents agreed with your decision of being a policewoman?&quot; 
Asked Minako

Rei frowned but answered anyway

&quot;My mom and dad passed away. So as my grandfather who took care of me 
for about seven years. So uncle Namada took care of me. He&#39;s the head 
chief of TNPH, the one I call big boss.&quot;

&quot;I was fascinated with his profession, so I asked him if he could give 
me training and here I am, now an agent&quot; Rei smiled

Minako placed her hand on top of Rei&#39;s

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know your guardians passed away&quot; Said Minako, 
giving her sympathy

&quot;It&#39;s alright. Uncle Namada is the best relative I know. He&#39;s always 
concerned and strict on what I do, that&#39;s why he always makes me clean 
his huge office as my penalty every time I did something wrong&quot; Said Rei 
then laughed

&quot;That&#39;s strong of you to accept the truth&quot; Minako opinioned

Rei&#39;s face went back to the same frown before

&quot;I&#39;m not strong. Physically maybe, I just chose to be a police because I 
think this will make me feel strong&quot;

Minako wiped Rei&#39;s bangs from covering her beautiful cerulean eyes

&quot;I think if your parents and your grandfather see you here as a very 
brave young woman, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be very, very proud of you&quot; Said 
Minako. Rei turned and focused her cerulean eyes to Minako&#39;s shining 
blue ones

&quot;Thank you&quot;

&quot;Welcome. It&#39;s my first time to tell words of inspiration to someone I 
just met, you know&quot; Said Minako

&quot;It&#39;s my first time to be a bodyguard as well&quot; Added Rei

&quot;Really?&quot; Minako&#39;s eyes widen a bit

&quot;Big boss always send me through dangerous missions and undercover, so I 
was surprised when he said that you are my mission&quot; Explained Rei

Suddenly they were cut by Mrs. Aino&#39;s voice calling them downstairs

&quot;Let&#39;s go down now, your mom&#39;s calling us&quot; Said Rei as she stood and 
walk

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Rei turned to face the pop star

&quot;I&#39;m glad your big boss sent you here. I won&#39;t be able to meet you if he 
didn&#39;t&quot; Minako smiled, so as Rei

&quot;I&#39;m glad he did. I never seen anyone as beautiful and as kind hearted 
as you, Minako&quot; Then Rei continue walking without looking back. Minako 
blushed

-----------------------------------------------------------

I&#39;m sorry this chapter&#39;s boring but I tried my best to squish a little 
romance here. I&#39;ll do better next chapter! I&#39;ll have to keep 
daydreaming!</pre>
