<pre>Confessions of Love

&#39;I just don&#39;t know what to do. I know I love Minako, but I also know 
that I&#39;m putting our friendship out on the line if I tell her so.&#39; I 
was in a Minako induced state of delirium. &#39;I need some major advice 
and I need it now.&#39; I then glanced at my alarm clock.

&quot;7:30 AM&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; that was the last thing I needed this morning. I wanted to sit 
in bed, dreaming of my precious Minako-chan, but I also knew that I 
needed to take my finals in algebra and history. I got dressed in 
record time, partially by forgetting to fix my hair and put on my 
makeup. &#39;Maybe, with luck, I can catch Minako just as I get to the 
school.&#39;

School was the same old drag it usually is, with the exception of the 
exams, which are just like any test, except for the fact that they are 
longer, more boring and count a decent percentage of my average. In my 
case, that would be about twenty percent of my final average.

&quot;Mako-chan, what&#39;s wrong? You seem a little out of it, today, if you 
know what I mean,&quot; Minako asked with more than a little concern for my 
state of mind. It would be fine, except for the fact that it&#39;s her 
asking.

&quot;Nothing, Minako-chan. I just haven&#39;t been getting enough sleep is all,&quot; 
I replied, hoping that she wouldn&#39;t notice that I was lying. It didn&#39;t 
work...

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me that you&#39;ve been turned down by another guy. I still 
can&#39;t believe that anyone could turn down someone as cute as you,&quot; she 
managed to get out before noticing the game store on the other side of 
the road. &quot;Mako-chan, why don&#39;t we stop in there for a moment? It&#39;d do 
you some good to get your mind off boys, anyways.&quot;

&quot;Uh, I need to talk to Ami-chan about the trigonometry homework. I&#39;ll 
catch ya later, though,&quot; I managed to get out before making a quick 
getaway.

A few minutes later, in front of the Hikawa shrine

&#39;I just hope Rei-chan has some decent advice,&#39; I thought. &quot;Rei-chan, 
could you help me with a little problem?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Mako-chan,&quot; Rei replied.

&quot;Rei-chan, I uh... really need your help to tell Minako-chan that I&#39;ve 
fallen in love with her,&quot; I said while my face was turning a deep 
crimson.

&quot;Mako-chan, relax. All you need to do is tell her how you truly feel. If 
it is meant to be, it will happen, if not, nothing will happen.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Rei-chan.&quot;

I then ran home, hoping to get a little sleep before the big 
confrontation.

The next morning

&quot;WAR CHILD, DANCE THE DAY

AND DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY...&quot;

&#39;Damn Sony alarm clock. I could have used an extra hour or two of 
sleep.&#39; I trudged out of bed, as best as I could, considering the fact 
that I have only had about three hours of sleep. &#39;KINO MAKOTO, YOU GET 
YOUR ASS IN GEAR AND PREPARE TO EMBARK ON A JOURNEY DOWN THE HALLOWED 
HALLS OF EDUCATION!!!&#39; I hate having to argue with myself on a Friday, 
but I&#39;ll make myself an exception for this one time.

Having thoroughly argued with myself on the virtues of a good education 
compared to the pleasure of spending an adequate time sleeping, I 
stepped into the shower without remembering to let the water heat 
beforehand. Let&#39;s just say I got a rather chilly reminder of my need to 
get a new water heater. By the time I was ready, it was time for me to 
leave. Go figure... &#39;Mental checklist: Turn off radio. check; turn 
stove off; check; remember Minako&#39;s lunch, whoops... Damn, I don&#39;t have 
time to go back and get it, so I&#39;ll just let her have mine. That should 
help my chances.&#39; Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by a certain 
inseparable pair in a gold Toyota 2000GT.

&quot;Good morning, Mako-chan,&quot; Michiru beamed, radiating her happiness to 
those around her.

&quot;Good morning, Michiru-san, Haruka-san.&quot; I replied, in the hope that I 
could maybe get a ride, as well as some more comprehensive advice on 
what to do about Minako.

&quot;Need a lift, Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Michiru-san&quot;

&quot;Hop in, then,&quot; Haruka said.

I entered the small sports car carefully, because I still remembered the 
last time I was in a hurry and Haruka-san gave me a lift. If my memory 
serves me correctly, I had a slight limp for a couple weeks afterward.

&quot;Haruka-san, could you tell me how to inform a woman that you love her?&quot; 
I asked, knowing that if Haruka couldn&#39;t, Michiru could.

&quot;Well, um, I just told Michiru how I felt, without any embellishment or 
decoration. I think that you may be better off being blunt about the 
issue than by easing your way into the situation,&quot; Haruka replied. 
About that time, we arrived at the junior high school, which was my cue 
to make myself scarce.

&quot;Thanks for the ride and the advice, Haruka-san.&quot; I managed to reply.

&quot;Anytime, Mako-chan,&quot; Michiru replied.

&#39;OK, now, I need to get to trigonometry, after I get rid of the 
clarinet.&#39; I made my way down to the band room, where I happen to bump 
into Minako. Literally, I wasn&#39;t looking where I was going and I walked 
into her as she was leaving the band room.

&quot;Minako-chan, are you hurt?&quot; I asked while I helped Minako back to her 
feet.

&quot;No, Mako-chan, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m just surprised, that&#39;s all,&quot; she replied 
without hesitation.

&quot;Minako-chan, I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you this for a while, but I 
didn&#39;t have the strength to say it until just now. I love you, Aino 
Minako, and that is a fact.&quot; I stopped there, after I realized that I 
may have scared her into shock, or something to that effect.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you would ever say that to me, but I&#39;m glad that you 
did. You have to realize that I&#39;ve also been in love with you for a 
while, Kino Makoto,&quot; she replied softly, before she kissed me.

&quot;Minako-chan, don&#39;t you think we need to wait until after school before 
we start doing stuff like this?&quot; I asked, remembering that I don&#39;t need 
to get the two of us suspended from school because of inappropriate 
behaviour.

Suddenly, a couple of troublemakers decided to cause us to have a light 
dose of misery with our love. &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you two queers take your 
face-sucking outside so that the rest of us don&#39;t catch your disease,&quot; 
was the comment from one uncouth young ruffian.

&quot;Why I ought to go over there and give you a nice, well-flattened face 
for your efforts, after all, I have to give credit where credit is 
due,&quot; I spat in response. I swear that if Minako hadn&#39;t been there, I 
might have killed the little punk.

&quot;Mako-chan, let&#39;s go to class. Ami-chan and Rei-chan were wanting to 
talk to us about tonight&#39;s sleepover, anyways,&quot; Minako whispered in my 
ear, just as I was going to teach that little punk why you don&#39;t mess 
with Kino Makoto and expect to live long enough to tell about it.

&quot;You&#39;re right, Mina-chan, I need to ask for some advice, anyways,&quot; I 
replied, while setting my beloved clarinet in my locker.

As we walked into first period, hand in hand, I noticed that the whole 
class was staring at us like we were a couple of freaks, except for 
Ami, Rei and Usagi, that is.

&quot;Good morning, Mako-chan, Minako-chan,&quot; Usagi called out in her usual 
overly cheerful fashion.

&quot;It&#39;s probably jinxed, now that you said something,&quot; Rei joked, in 
response to Usagi&#39;s statement.

I sat down beside Minako, as I do every morning, and turned to discuss 
the menu for the sleepover at Rei&#39;s. &quot;Rei-chan, what do you think I 
need to make tonight?&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan, don&#39;t go to so much trouble about it. Anyways, I already 
have everything I want right here,&quot; Rei replied, while gesturing 
towards Ami.

At that moment, the loudspeaker came on. &quot;Kino Makoto, Aino Minako, Hino 
Rei, Mizuno Ami, please report to the office.&quot;

At this, Sato Keiko, the class socialite, said,&quot; Good, maybe those 
no-good lesbian bitches will get expelled.&quot;

As a result of Keiko-baka&#39;s insolence, Ami-chan and Minako-chan began 
crying. I don&#39;t really care if someone messes with me, but if they mess 
with my friends, it&#39;s a different story. &quot;Why don&#39;t you just go back to 
hell, already?&quot; I managed to reply while attempting to calm Minako-chan 
down, and Rei was doing the same with Ami.

&quot;Mako-chan, I think she got thrown out for bad behaviour,&quot; Rei said. At 
that, Minako and Ami began to laugh.

As we walked down the hallways, en route to the office, I began to 
wonder what it was that they called us to the office for. Upon entering 
the office, the principal, Ms. Yamashima, motioned for us to be seated.

&quot;Ladies, it has come to my attention that you have all openly admitted 
your homosexuality. I personally have nothing against such 
relationships, but some of your fellow students have informed their 
parents, who in turn have contacted me with complaints. If you want to 
remain in your respective relationships outside school property, that 
is fine, but if you don&#39;t cease and desist from open displays of 
affection on school property, I shall be forced to take more drastic 
measures to aid in minimising the damage.&quot;

I was incensed, to say the least. We get called out of class, just so 
that silly bitch can tell us that we can&#39;t display any signs of our 
relationship on school grounds. &quot;Excuse me, Ms. Yamashima, but I, my 
girlfriend and my close friends feel that your decision is not only 
wrong, it is offensive to us, considering that we all tend to avoid 
trouble, we all have fairly high averages in our classes, and we are 
all well liked by our respective teachers.&quot; At this point, I sat down 
and let Ami do the talking.

&quot;As my friend was saying,&quot;Ami stated, &quot; we are not troublesome, for the 
most part. I pose but one question for you. If a heterosexual 
relationship can be openly expressed between students, why can&#39;t a 
homosexual relationship be given the same freedom of expression?&quot; At 
this, we all walked out of the office and back to class.

On the way to the Hikawa shrine from the school

&#39;I don&#39;t know if I can take it anymore. At least I have Minako, which is 
all I need to live. How are we going to tell her parents?&#39; Oh, 
kami-sama, she is so beautiful. Let the world go to hell in a hand 
basket, I have my Minako. &quot;Minako-chan, I love you,&quot; I whispered in her 
ear.

&quot;I love you too,&quot; she whispered, before she gave me a passionate kiss 
that even had me surprised.

&quot;Minako-chan, I think we&#39;re here,&quot; I said, after noticing that we had 
passed the path up to the shrine.

&quot;Mako-chan, they can wait a little longer,&quot; she said with more than a 
little mischief in her voice.

Suddenly we were interrupted by that familiar gold Toyota belonging to 
Haruka. &quot;Mako-chan, did my advice work?&quot; Haruka asked eagerly.

&quot;Hai, Haruka-san. It worked perfectly,&quot; I replied.

&quot;What do you mean by advice?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;I asked Haruka if she could help me come up with the right words to 
confess my love to you,&quot; I replied, being more than a little 
embarrassed.

Suddenly Usagi called out to us. &quot;Mako-chan, Mina-chan, Haruka-san, 
Michiru-san, why don&#39;t you all come in to talk?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, I need to get home so I can change the oil on my baby 
again,&quot; Haruka called out as she drove away at a torrid pace.

&quot;Mako-chan, please come fix something for the bottomless pit, before she 
starts eating my manga collection,&quot; Rei screamed.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t eat your manga collection, and you know it!&quot; Usagi yelled. 
&quot;Anyways, it&#39;s way too perverted for me to touch.&quot;

&quot;How would you know it&#39;s perverted if you didn&#39;t have some of it,&quot; Rei 
retorted.

&quot;Minako-chan, I think we better go stop them from killing each other,&quot; I 
whispered.

&quot;Hai, my love,&quot; Minako replied, before giving me a quick kiss.

&#39;She&#39;s so soft and beautiful. Oh, why does this have to be out in the 
open, instead of a quiet bedroom. No, Makoto, don&#39;t start thinking 
indecent thoughts until after you get finished with dinner. Note to 
self: make sure to sleep as close to Minako as possible. Well, that and 
borrow some manga from Rei-chan.&#39; I walked into the kitchen with the 
purpose of preparing a nice meal, that is, until I discovered that 
someone had already done the cooking. I&#39;d guess that it was Ami-chan, 
considering that she is the only other one of the senshi who can cook 
something edible. &#39;I wonder if Rei has any chocolate syrup... No, 
Mako-chan, remember, no perverted thoughts until after dinner. Better 
yet, make that after you get to bed. No, that may be in the same bed as 
Minako, and I don&#39;t want to do that, yet. &quot;I need a break,&quot; I said to 
no one in particular.

&quot;Mako-chan, why don&#39;t you lay down, and I&#39;ll give you a nice, relaxing 
massage to ease the tension,&quot; Minako said as she walked into the 
kitchen and took my hand into hers.

&#39;Oh, her hand is so soft and perfect. I just wonder if the rest of her 
body is so perfect underneath those pesky clothes. No, Mako-chan, don&#39;t 
give in to the temptation until after you go to bed. I doubt I could 
stand having to lay there with my goddess above me, reveling in my 
torture. I can&#39;t, no, I won&#39;t let her get the upper hand. Then again, 
it would feel rather nice for a change.&#39; Suddenly my thoughts were 
interrupted by a rather off-key rendition of Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;Another 
Brick in the Wall (Part 2).

&quot;We don&#39;t need no education...&quot;Usagi sang, while Ami was trying to 
silence her, albeit unsuccessfully.

&quot;Minako-chan, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s getting a little late?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Hai, Mako-chan.&quot;

With that, we slipped off to the living room, where we fell asleep in a 
gentle embrace.

The next morning

I woke up to a pretty interesting scene. Let&#39;s just put it that way for 
simplicity.

&quot;Odango-head, wake up,&quot; Rei screamed as loud as she could, which is 
pretty loud.

&quot;Rei-chan, I don&#39;t know about you, but I couldn&#39;t sleep with you and 
Ami-chan screaming all night,&quot; Usagi retorted.

&quot;Let Usagi-chan sleep, after all, she is still recovering from eating 
that truckload of ice cream last week,&quot; Ami said.

&quot;Minako-chan, are you awake yet?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Hai, my love,&quot; she replied with a little kiss on the cheek.

&quot;You do realize that we need to tell your parents soon, don&#39;t you?&quot; I 
asked.

&quot;Hai, and you&#39;re going to be the one to break the news to them, are you 
not?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Mina-koi, and you&#39;re going to back me up the entire time.&quot; I 
replied.

She responded by giving me one of the most passionate kisses I&#39;ve ever 
had. &#39;Oh, kami-sama, don&#39;t let it stop.&#39; I was speechless, to say the 
least.

&quot;Minako-chan, Mako-chan, do you two have something that you want to 
share with us?&quot; Usagi asked. It&#39;s amazing how dense she can be at 
times.

&quot;Usagi-baka, haven&#39;t you figured it out by now? They are in love, you 
fool!&quot; Rei screamed in that tone she only uses on Usagi.

&quot;Oh, like Mamo-chan and I are. I see, now. Congratulations, Mako-chan,&quot; 
Usagi said.

&quot;Excuse me, but Mako-chan and I have some shopping to do, so we need to 
go now if we&#39;re going to miss the crowds. We&#39;ll see you later,&quot; Minako 
said.

&quot;Minako-chan, I didn&#39;t know about any shopping trip,&quot; I whispered.

&quot;Mako-chan, just play along, it&#39;ll get us some time to ourselves, and I 
know how you&#39;ve been wanting to slip away from everyone for a nice 
romantic dinner, or something,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Sayonara, everyone,&quot; I said, while taking my darling Minako by the arm 
and walking out the door. &#39;Now to deal with the hard part, her 
parents.&#39; I had to brace myself mentally for the challenge ahead of me. 
Minako&#39;s parents can be a couple of hard-asses when they want to be, 
and I suspected that this would be one of those times.

&quot;Minako-chan, I think we need to tell your parents before this 
relationship goes any further than it already has,&quot; I said with more 
than a little uncertainty in my voice.

&quot;Hai, Mako-chan. We need to get this off our chests before we start 
removing other things from them,&quot; Minako replied.

&#39;I wouldn&#39;t mind getting helping to remove some stuff off her chest, but 
that&#39;s just me. No, you silly baka, don&#39;t get those perverted thoughts 
in your head now. It&#39;ll make being with her even harder than it already 
is. Damn, you already have to restrain yourself from ripping her 
clothes off every time you get within ten feet of her, and what makes 
you think that thinking those thoughts will make things any easier on 
you.&#39; I can&#39;t help arguing with myself when it comes to my darling 
Minako. I guess it comes with the territory.

&quot;Mako-chan, when we tell my parents, do you think they&#39;ll be mad at us?&quot; 
Minako asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, but whatever happens, you know that I&#39;ll always love 
you,&quot; I said softly, before I picked her up and carried her down the 
steps from the shrine. &#39;I have a feeling that she is really enjoying 
this part. Then again, I don&#39;t mind, myself. Now, if only we were going 
into my apartment, then things would be interesting.&#39; I set my goddess 
down gently, after we reached the bottom of the steps, where our 
pre-arranged ride was waiting.

&quot;Good morning, Minako-chan, Mako-chan,&quot; Haruka said as she came around 
to open the door of her new Subaru Impreza STi wagon.

&quot;Good morning, Haruka-san. Where&#39;s Michiru-san?&quot; Minako asked 
inquisitively.

&quot;She was pretty tired, so I decided to let her sleep in this morning. We 
had a unusually long night, last night,&quot; Haruka replied.

Minako and I got into the back seat, so we could talk without either one 
of us being in pain from the neck-straining forces caused by Haruka&#39;s 
constant disregard for the traffic laws.

&quot;Mako-chan, are you sure this is safe?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;Hai, Minako-chan. The worst thing you have to worry about is when she 
comes to a traffic light. If it&#39;s red, worry. If it&#39;s green, hang on to 
me and pray that someone&#39;s not in Haruka-san&#39;s way,&quot; I replied.

&quot;I heard that, but since I think you two are cute, I&#39;ll let it slide 
this time. So, where do you want to go today?&quot; Haruka asked.

&quot;First, we need to go by Minako&#39;s house to let her parents know about 
our relationship. Then, we need to go shopping to find her some new 
clothes and maybe a little more revealing set of lingerie, for those 
times. After that, back to my place, so I can prepare a nice romantic 
dinner,&quot; I replied.

&quot;OK, you girls need to strap in tight, because I just put a new turbo on 
this little seductress that boosted my power output to a little over 
500 bhp. By the way, Mako-chan, if you want to know how to be more like 
me, there is a really good American magazine called Car and Driver that 
is really informative. I really think you might like it,&quot; Haruka said, 
even though about ninety percent of it went in one ear and out the 
other.

&quot;Mako-chan, what does all that stuff mean,&quot; Minako asked, while 
expecting me to have all the answers.

&quot;It means that this thing should run like a bat out of hell, and sound a 
little like one in the process,&quot; Haruka answered for me, which saved a 
lot of embarrassment on my part.

&quot;I see, now. You were saying that this is a really fast car, right?&quot; 
Minako asked, while we were fastening the six point Sparco safety 
harnesses.

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s one way of putting it,&quot; Haruka replied, just before 
starting the aforementioned Subaru.

I was slightly scared at this point. I don&#39;t know whether it was the 
fact that it was Haruka driving a 500 bhp Subaru, or the fact that 
she&#39;s listening to Rammstein while driving.

&quot;Mako-chan, what are you going to say when we get to my house?&quot; Minako 
asked.

&quot;I haven&#39;t got a clue. I guess I&#39;ll just tell the truth, and if they get 
all pissed, they can just deal with it, because I love you and nothing 
will ever change that.&quot; I replied just as Haruka decided to pitch the 
little Subaru sideways as she turned into Minako-chan&#39;s driveway.

&quot;We&#39;re here, folks,&quot; Haruka said in an unusually cheerful tone.

&quot;Thanks, Haruka-san. We&#39;ll be out in about half an hour, so if you want 
to go home for that time, you&#39;re more than welcome to. Then again, you 
can always come in for additional moral support,&quot; Minako said really 
fast.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll go in with the two of you. Anyways, you may need a little 
help moving your stuff,&quot; Haruka replied.

As we were walking into her house, I couldn&#39;t help but feel that feeling 
of impending doom that you get when you know that something is going to 
go way out of whack and you can&#39;t do anything to stop it. As luck would 
have it, we were greeted by her mother as soon as we walked in, or as 
some would put it, waltzed in.

&quot;Minako-chan, I see that you brought some friends over. Why don&#39;t you 
show them into the living room. I&#39;ll be there in a moment, as soon as I 
finish washing dishes,&quot; Aino Ayeka said in a warm tone.

&quot;Mom, we need to talk,&quot; Minako replied in a really stern tone that 
doesn&#39;t suit her at all.

&quot;What is it, dear?&quot; Mrs. Aino asked questioningly. &quot;Is it because of one 
of those silly boys at school. I told you to hold off on dating, but, 
no, you just have to go out and get your heart broken by one of those 
silly athletes, not like Mr. &#39;I&#39;ve dated every girl within a fifty mile 
radius&#39; over there is any help,&quot;she said while pointing at Haruka.

&quot;Excuse me, Mrs. Aino, but let me clear up a couple of facts for you. 
First, I am a girl. Second, I wouldn&#39;t betray my Michiru for anything, 
and if you even insinuate that I am one of those love them and leave 
them types, I swear that I will hunt you to the ends of the Earth and 
make sure you suffer a horrible and rather painful death,&quot; Haruka spat 
venomously.

Let me say this, I was in a room with two royally pissed women, and from 
the looks of it, neither one was going to back down any time in the 
near future.

&quot;Minako, dear, you aren&#39;t going to tell me that she is what you are here 
to discuss,&quot; Mrs. Aino said while glaring at Haruka, who was too busy 
reading the latest issue of Car and Driver to care.

&#39;I guess that I may throw gasoline on the fire, just this once. It&#39;ll be 
worth it just to kiss those soft lips again. Then again, the look on 
her mother&#39;s face will be enough satisfaction. Damn, Makoto, when will 
you get it through your thick skull that listening to Haruka isn&#39;t 
always a good idea.&#39; I then leaned over and gave my love a nice, 
passionate kiss that would have been fit to go in one of those sad, 
romantic movies that Ami-chan is always watching, at least, when I 
visit, that is.

&quot;You are a bloody lesbian! I would expect it from someone like Ms. &#39;I 
wanna be a guy&#39; over there, but never from my beloved daughter. Why, 
Minako, why?&quot; was the response we got from Mrs. Aino. I guess that some 
people are too damn stupid to realize true love when they see it.

&quot;Excuse me for breaking into your chewing out my beloved, but let me set 
something straight here, I don&#39;t really give a rat&#39;s ass about what you 
think of me, or my relationship with your daughter, but will you at 
least have the decency to leave Haruka and Minako out of this. I love 
Minako dearly, and I don&#39;t want to see her hurt, especially by her own 
mother&#39;s words. If you&#39;ll excuse me, I think I&#39;ve had my say in the 
matter,&quot; I said with more than a hint of hatred in my tone. If it 
wasn&#39;t for the fact that I actually don&#39;t like beating people to a 
pulp, she would have been a shapeless blob on the floor.

&quot;Mako-chan...,&quot; Minako started.

&quot;Minako, I forbid you to see this woman and her co-conspirator in this 
evil scheme,&quot; Mrs Aino spat out.

&quot;No. I absolutely refuse to follow that directive, and if you have 
anything against it, you can deal with Haruka-san,&quot; Minako calmly 
replied.

&quot;Don&#39;t look at me, I&#39;m only here to drive her around and to help her 
move her stuff, if you boot her out,&quot; Haruka said.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad that someone has some sense, because I am most 
definitely demanding that Minako leave with her belongings by sundown, 
and don&#39;t forget to take that damn cat,&quot; Mrs. Aino hissed.

Well, I, being the wise being that I am, decided to get a head start 
moving Minako&#39;s stuff. &#39;It&#39;s a good thing Haruka has a wagon as her 
second car, even if it has a 0-100 km/h. time similar to that of a 
Mercedes Benz SL65 AMG.&#39; Let&#39;s just say that Haruka also had the same 
idea, and we were both stopped by the same bitch who happens to have 
supplied fifty percent of my beloved Minako&#39;s genetic code. I think she 
must have been on her period, or something. I&#39;m just glad Minako isn&#39;t 
that way.

&quot;What do you two think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Mrs. Bitch, I mean Aino asked.

&quot;We&#39;re going to get Minako&#39;s stuff, since you obviously don&#39;t want her 
around anymore,&quot; I said politely, with a hint of annoyance.

&quot;Mako-chan, let me help you get my stuff,&quot; Minako commanded.

&quot;No, I&#39;m the leader today, and I say that you need to wait in the car 
and I&#39;ll be out in a minute,&quot; I joked.

&quot;OK, Mako-chan, but I&#39;ll have my revenge tonight,&quot; Minako purred.

&quot;Excuse me, but you two can have your little lovers quarrel in the car. 
Unlike you two, I skipped a race to be here, and I expect to get 
something done. You two do realize that JGTC drivers like me don&#39;t work 
cheap,&quot; Haruka quipped.

&quot;You&#39;re the Haruka Tenoh, the one who has been dominating the JGTC for 
the past two years, and you&#39;re here to help my daughter move!&quot; Mrs. 
Aino exclaimed.

&quot;Uh, yeah. It certainly wasn&#39;t to see you,&quot; Haruka said with the air of 
someone who has to explain the obvious to someone.

&quot;By all means, I&#39;m sorry to have offended you earlier. Please, make 
yourself comfortable,&quot; Mrs. Aino said.

&quot;No, she&#39;s only here to help me move in with Mako-chan, and that&#39;s all 
she&#39;ll be doing here. She&#39;s already taken, anyways,&quot; Minako snapped.

&quot;Minako-chan, let&#39;s just get your stuff while your mother is occupied 
with Haruka-san,&quot; I whispered in her ear.

&quot;Oh, good idea,&quot; she whispered back.

At that, we slipped upstairs and began to pack Minako&#39;s things. Not long 
afterward, Haruka-san came up and began carrying Minako&#39;s clothes out 
to the car. Nothing really happened until the question of taking the 
bed and the dresser came up.

&quot;Mako-chan, we won&#39;t need those things, after all, we&#39;ll be sharing a 
bed,&quot; Minako said.

&quot;What if you kick me out of the bedroom, then where will I sleep?&quot; I 
asked in reply.

&quot;Do like Haruka-san, sleep on the couch,&quot; Minako replied.

&quot;Excuse me, but I haven&#39;t gotten sent to the couch since the time I 
kissed Usagi at that party last week,&quot; Haruka joked, because she 
actually got caught trying to flirt with Rei-chan about three days ago.

&quot;I thought that was over spending more time with your car than with 
Michiru,&quot; Minako said.

&quot;Hey, I thought I told her not to tell anyone about that,&quot; Haruka said.

&quot;Excuse me, but what are we going to do with Artemis while we&#39;re 
shopping?&quot; I asked.

&quot;We can just drop by your place and unload the car before we go 
shopping,&quot; Haruka suggested.

&quot;I guess that&#39;ll work,&quot; I said, while wondering how Artemis will get 
along with me, after he catches Minako and I while we&#39;re busy.

I was interrupted by that aforementioned white cat. I&#39;m just glad that 
he isn&#39;t Nazi-esque, unlike another cat I know...

&quot;Excuse me, but what are you doing moving Minako&#39;s stuff, and where is 
my food bowl?&quot; Artemis asked.

&quot;For your information, you, as well as Minako, have been evicted because 
of her coming out of the closet with her homosexuality, and, as a 
result, you are moving in with me,&quot; I said.

&quot;Just don&#39;t keep me awake, all night. Cats need sleep, too, you know,&quot; 
Artemis joked.

&quot;Yeah right, Arty. I know about you sneaking off to visit Luna at odd 
hours,&quot; Minako quipped.

After this, we began to make quick work of the arduous task that is 
packing up all of Minako&#39;s things and placing them in a small Subaru 
wagon. After we finished, we piled into the car, cat and all, and made 
a beeline for my place, to unload all of Minako-chan&#39;s things. After 
that, we went on to the mall.

In front of a game store in the mall

&quot;Mako-chan, can we please go in there?&quot; Minako asked with those all too 
kawaii puppy-dog eyes and that little pout that can melt even the 
hardest heart.

&quot;After we get done getting some new clothes,&quot; I replied. At this, I 
grabbed Minako by the arm and dragged her into one of the clothing 
stores. Just because I am in the leading role in this relationship 
doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t enjoy looking as feminine as possible. I love 
wearing skirts and all those frilly little doodads. It&#39;s just a 
personal quirk, I guess.

&quot;Mako-chan, how does this look?&quot; Minako asked while holding up a 
beautiful orange dress that fit her personality perfectly, if I do say 
so myself.

&quot;It looks perfect for you, if I do say so myself. However, you need to 
try it on, first,&quot;I said in response.

I saw the perfect dress for me. It was a beautiful dark teal-green that 
was ravishing to say the least. Haruka would say it was British Racing 
Green.

&quot;Hey Minako, how does this look?&quot; I asked while picking up the dress.

&quot;It looks beautiful. Why don&#39;t you come with me to try it on?&quot; Minako 
asked.

&quot;Sure, we can share a dressing room,&quot; I joked.

&quot;Hey, how did you know that was what I was thinking?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;Lucky guess, I think,&quot; I replied.

&quot;Where did Haruka go?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;I think she had to go get a turbo or something at Kameda-san&#39;s garage. 
Don&#39;t worry, she had that motorcycle strapped to the roof, so she could 
go down there without leaving us stranded. I have the keys to the 
Subaru in my pocket,&quot; I said in reply.

Well, we continued on in that fashion for another hour or so before 
getting around to the game store, as I promised Minako-chan. As we 
walked in, I noticed a couple of games that caught my eye. Let&#39;s face 
it, I am not totally opposed to gaming, which my PlayStation 2 is a 
perfect example of. I really like Final Fantasy X-2 because of all the 
eye candy.

&quot;Mako-chan, why don&#39;t we get this one,&quot; Minako asked while holding up a 
copy of Gran Turismo 4 for the PS2.

&quot;I always knew you had a thing for racing games,&quot; I joked. &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll 
buy it for you, but you&#39;ll have to pay me back later.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m usually broke, though,&quot; Minako replied.

&quot;I have my ways of extracting payment,&quot; I said coyly.

Well, we each ended up getting a couple of games. I got a copy of &#39;Star 
Ocean: Till the End of Time&#39; and &#39;Kingdom Hearts&#39;, considering the fact 
I haven&#39;t played either one, yet. Minako got &#39;Gran Turismo 4&#39; and &#39;Need 
for Speed Underground 2&#39;. I still don&#39;t see why she likes racing games 
so much. Maybe it&#39;s because they&#39;re good for a quick bet or something. 
I honestly don&#39;t have a clue.

&quot;Mako-chan, can we stop by the music store before we leave,&quot; Minako 
asks, with a rather suspicious smile on her face.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve been meaning to stop in there, anyways,&quot; I replied, as Minako 
began to drag me into the music store.

&#39;OK. I just need to find some good, easy listening music, so I don&#39;t 
have to listen to Rammstein on the way home. Ah, yes, Jethro Tull will 
do nicely.&#39; I have a thing for classic rock, as the large stack of cds 
I carried up to the counter proved. Well, it wasn&#39;t that large. I only 
got Pink Floyd&#39;s The Wall, Jethro Tull&#39;s Thick as a Brick and Minstrel 
in the Gallery and David Bowie&#39;s Space Oddity, and The Rise and Fall of 
Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. I didn&#39;t let Minako pick 
anything out because she ran my budget dry at the game store. Hey, at 
least KH is cheap, now that it&#39;s been out for a couple of years.

&quot;Minako-chan, I think we need to go home now,&quot; I said softly, after 
noticing Keiko-baka&#39;s grand appearance in the store.

&quot;Well, if it isn&#39;t the whore and her little bitch,&quot; Keiko shouted for 
all to hear.

&quot;At least I have taste, which is something you are definitely lacking 
in,&quot; Minako countered.

&quot;Minako-chan, we should go home. I&#39;d like to make baka over there 
jealous when she sees us getting into that new Subaru that Haruka-san 
so graciously loaned us,&quot; I whispered.

&quot;Ooh, is the little bitch scared?&quot; Keiko asked sardonically.

At that, Minako and I calmly walked out to the car and drove off, 
leaving four nice, wide patches of rubber to show that we had been 
there. Of course, Keiko was probably green with envy as we drove off, 
but who could blame her. Especially when she looks like she would gain 
a little beauty if she was hit with a Mack truck. &#39;Now for the calm 
music to settle my nerves&#39; I then placed my faithful copy of &quot;Dark Side 
of the Moon&quot; that I always keep with me, in case of emergency.

&quot;Mako-chan, I&#39;m starting to get a little hungry,&quot; Minako said.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, darling, I&#39;ll make some nice, warm miso soup as soon as we 
get home,&quot; I replied.

Well, things were uneventful after that, I made dinner for the three of 
us, including Artemis, that is, cleaned the kitchen and had a little 
fun with Minako. Overall, not a bad night&#39;s work.

The next morning

&#39;What time is it?&#39;

10:38 A.M.

&quot;Damn! I need to call Haruka and ask her to pick up her baby.&quot; I 
exclaimed..

&quot;What is it, honey? Can we play some more, because I want to,&quot; Minako 
said, while rolling over in a half asleep daze, which thoroughly 
exposed her breasts.

&#39;No, Makoto, you do NOT have Minako for breakfast. She is your lover, 
not your life. OK, maybe she is your life, but you won&#39;t take advantage 
of her until she is fully alert. Damn, I like this view, just fine. 
Arguing with myself on whether to have sex or not is extremely tiring. 
I should know, I have to do it all the time. I just gave up and took a 
nice, hot bath to ease the stress of the previous few days. &#39;NOW, I can 
get some peace, even though I wouldn&#39;t mind having it disturbed by 
Minako-chan.&#39; At that moment, Minako walked into the bathroom, in her 
pristine glory. Yeah, she&#39;s hot.

&quot;Mako-chan, do you mind if I join you?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Uh... yes, you can, if you don&#39;t mind a little playing around,&quot; I said 
as sensually as I could.

At that, Minako stepped elegantly into the small bathtub and positioned 
herself behind me, so I couldn&#39;t be tempted any more than I already 
was.

I&#39;m going to skip the graphic descriptions because I don&#39;t want to state 
the obvious. Yes, we had sex. That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say on that.

Well, we went off and did our own thing. Minako played the PS2 and I 
cooked all day. We are completely boring when we&#39;re not being taunted 
by Keiko-baka, or in bed together. About this time, a certain black cat 
and her odangoed owner showed up for dinner.

&quot;Hi, Mako-chan, Minako-chan,&quot; Usagi called out as she stepped in.

&quot;Why did you bring the Nazi along?&quot; I asked, as I saw Luna, who was 
carrying a Nazi flag and chanting &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; while marching around 
the living room.

&quot;You know how she is when she can see Artemis,&quot; Usagi started. I really 
wasn&#39;t listening, so I chose to go back to my cooking. It was an 
uneventful dinner, except for Luna stating that she is the 
reincarnation of Adolf Hitler. You know, I can actually believe that. 
Well, other than that, it was uneventful. After Usagi left, with Stalin 
the cat, in tow, Minako and I got into bed and we said the same the 
same thing to each other, at the same time.

&quot;Aishiteru, my love,&quot; we said to each other.

Fin (Until further notice, that is)

Well, I think I did a decent job. I spent a week on this thing, so it 
should be decent. I haven&#39;t gotten any sleep in three days and I 
haven&#39;t checked the email since Monday night. I may write another 
chapter or two before I have to go back into school, but that depends 
on whether I finish War and Peace in time. Thanks for reading.

C-chan
