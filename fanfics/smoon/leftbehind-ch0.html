<h1>Left Behind (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/evileric.html">Evil Eric</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The sun was setting low on a warm Tokyo afternoon.  The sky was painted
a rich orange with reddish wisps of cloud that looked like flames in the
distance.

The serene waters of the lake splashed and rippled quietly, mirroring
the sunset above them.

A warm breeze drifted through the trees, making the branches sway.  The
rustling of leaves was all that could be heard for miles around.  That
is, until a pair of visitors arrived.

Their presence was announced by the sound of an engine rumbling.  After
a short time, a motorcycle emerged from the woodsy road.  As it made its
way out of the trees, it could be seen that the passenger was clinging
to the driver for dear life.

The driver pulled the bike over and removed her helmet.  She was a tall,
handsome woman with short, sandy hair.  The passenger did the same.  She
had longer, aqua-colored hair and a calm, gentle beauty to her.  She was
also petrified.

&quot;Haruka,&quot; she asked her partner, &quot;do you have to drive it that fast?&quot;

&quot;Fast?&quot; puzzled Haruka.  &quot;Michiru, we were only going about 40 kph.&quot;

Michiru shook her head and pressed her hands to her temples.  &quot;That&#39;s
it?  Gods...it felt a lot faster.&quot;

Haruka grinned.  &quot;It always does, the first time you ride one,&quot; she
said.  &quot;Why do you think I wasn&#39;t going as fast as I usually do?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I want to know how fast that is.&quot;

&quot;Still not as fast as I could go on the racing circuit,&quot; Haruka said,
putting her hands in her jacket pockets and looking downcast at the
ground.

Michiru paused.  She heard a kind of reluctant longing in Haruka&#39;s
voice, and she knew what the other woman was feeling.  For the two of
them, it was more than just the day that was ending, it was a way of
life.  True, the old life had been one of endless searching, longing,
and desperation for meaning, but it had been the only one they had ever
known, and it was hard to let go of.  Haruka had been forced to leave
her glory days on the racetrack behind, and Michiru had had to all but
give up her violin.

It wasn&#39;t going to be the same.  But that was how all beginnings were.
After all, if nothing ever ended, nothing new could begin.

&quot;I know you miss all of that,&quot; Michiru said.  &quot;We&#39;re both putting a lot
on the line for our destiny.  But I have faith in it...I have faith in
us.&quot;

Haruka looked at her, and back down at her feet.  &quot;Yeah.&quot;

Michiru took her by the arm, and pointed off in the distance.  &quot;Look,
there&#39;s a bridge over there.&quot;

&quot;What about it?&quot;

&quot;I bet there&#39;s a really good view of the sunset from there.&quot;

&quot;Well, if you want to see it, we&#39;ll go.&quot;

They walked the short distance to the bridge, the wind blowing through
their hair and clothes.  When they reached the bridge, Haruka stopped
while Michiru walked to the edge.  Michiru looked back and noticed her
partner several feet away.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Michiru.

&quot;Like you said...admiring the view.&quot;

&quot;Come over here.&quot;

Haruka took a few steps forward, until she and Michiru were standing
next to each other.  For a moment they just stood there and watched the
sunset.  Then Haruka stirred.

&quot;Did you just hear something?&quot; Haruka asked.

&quot;What?  No, I didn&#39;t hear anything.&quot;

&quot;I could have sworn I heard a click.&quot;

&quot;It was probably your imagination.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, I guess so.&quot;

They stood in silence a little longer.  Then Michiru got a playful look
in her eyes, and turned her head toward Haruka.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot; she asked.

&quot;What?&quot; Haruka replied.

&quot;What I&#39;m looking at...right now.&quot;

&quot;I thought you wanted to see the sunset?&quot;

&quot;Already seen it.&quot;

Michiru drew Haruka&#39;s face down to hers, and took the blonde woman&#39;s
lips with her own.  All around them, the light continued to diminish as
the day gave way to the night.
