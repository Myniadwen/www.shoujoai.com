<h1>Sailer GG (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pedarandersson.html">PederAndersson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Haruka was motionless with her head resting against the pillow, her
short blond hair was a little tangled but eyes, lips and skin peaceful and her
nostrils widened as she inhaled cold air coming towards her from the open
window.
	Beside Haruka rested Michiru, she was awake and regarded her lovers back
as she brought her fingers through her spring green hair. To her lips came a
smile as she shuffled closer to Haruka and embraced her from behind, rested her
hands on Haruka&#39;s belly and tussled with the growth of hair covering the tense
skin. Most carefully she kissed the tip of Haruka&#39;s right shoulder, felt her
lips against the cold skin and her own tongue that moistened it sweetly. She
took a deep breath, inhaled the fumes rising from her wife. She graced a second
kiss upon Haruka&#39;s skin as she spread her fingers apart to grant caress wide
over the belly, felt the new shapes it had received and inside her came a burst
of joy.
	She was awake but kept her eyes closed, enjoyed the kisses on her
shoulder and the fingertips traversing her abdomen exploring the signs of her
pregnancy. Michiru came closer as her kisses moved up the neck and Haruka smiled
as she felt two breast deforming against her back transferring to her a calm
heat.
	&quot;Good morning my love Michiru said and rested her chin against Haruka&#39;s
shoulder. &quot;Tea or coffee?&quot; She continued as her wife looked at her with two
loving but tired eyes. &quot;Feeling pregnant?&quot; Then both smiled and their hands
joined to caress the resting of the child.
	&quot;No more then usual.&quot; Haruka said and reached for Michiru&#39;s cheek,
touched it tenderly while she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll take coffee.&quot; The two enjoyed a
brief kiss then remained close. Haruka wrapped her fingers with Michiru&#39;s and
brought their hands to rest at the mound of her belly.

Chapter 1: Morning Coffee.

	&quot;I need to take a shower.&quot; Haruka said and released her loved ones hands
then stretched them towards the ceiling before she rested her right arm around
Michiru. &quot;Will you join me?&quot; She felt her wife&#39;s soft blue hair against her arm
then they looked at each other, kissed a second time and now for a longer
duration.
	Michiru regarded Haruka&#39;s lips as they retreated from hers. &quot;I guess
breakfast will have to wait.&quot; She made a noiseless exhale as she removed the
blanket covering them. They where both naked with bodies of some age; Haruka
being the taller one with a more male build to her body apart from her growing
bulk of a belly and breast that where going through changes with a increase in
size and areolae more rough and larger. Michiru was shorter then Haruka but not
with much and she had female shapes to each section of her body but beside the
pregnant Haruka she looked immature.
	&quot;Good.&quot; Haruka said and squeezed Michiru&#39;s thigh bringing a flirtatious
glee to her eyes and her wife giggled to roll over to rest in Haruka&#39;s embrace.
Haruka kissed Michiru&#39;s forehead, inhaled the remains of sweat that there
lingered and a moment passed. Heartbeats that resonated as their skin touched
and a sudden serene sensation enveloped them.



	The hot water washed over Michiru and soaked her hair, she removed some
hair from her face then looked at Haruka who entered the shower fresh from the
toilet and received the water on her body and met Michiru&#39;s gaze. &quot;Do you still
find me attractive?&quot;
	Michiru nodded and smiled revealing her peach gum. &quot;Yeah, why?&quot; She gave
her armpits a thorough rinse while regarding her wife.
	Haruka looked up at the mouthpiece feeling the water striking against
her face while she was thinking, then rubbed her face with her hands and looked
at Michiru. &quot;Since I became pregnant you haven&#39;t even once asked me if we could
have sex, it has always been me asking you.&quot;
	Michiru twisted the valve to a close as she joined with Haruka&#39;s gaze &quot;I
didn&#39;t want to pressure you, with all the changes. I wanted you to decide when.&quot;
She smiled and reached for the shampoo. &quot;It&#39;s not like your pregnancy has made
you less of a woman.&quot; She pried open the lid to the bottle &quot;You should have told
me.&quot; She squeezed the crystal blue shampoo into a cupped hand then handed the
bottle over.
	Haruka took the bottle. &quot;I have been thinking about it while you have
been at work, there are other ladies out there. Maybe with a grumpy pregnant old
me at home you had found a fresher meadow.&quot;
	Michiru remained motionless with her hands in her foam blue hair. On her
face was a series of expression, calm, anger, fear but none that stayed until
all that remained was a emptiness. &quot;What?&quot;
	With a explosive smile on her face Haruka pointed the bottle at her
wife&#39;s chest and squirted the blue shampoo over it while she laughed. &quot;Surprise
me sometime.&quot;
	&quot;Did you really think I would cheat on you?&quot; Michiru said and rubbed the
shampoo to a thick foam over her chest.
	&quot;Sometimes.&quot; Haruka replied and replied and returned the bottle to the
shelf. &quot;But I trust you.&quot; She massaged the crystal liquid into her hair with her
gaze steady on her loved one. &quot;You know I do.&quot;
	Michiru smiled, released a tiny still nervous giggle then reached for
the valve. &quot;I get the idea.&quot;



	Haruka stirred in the tall dark mug while she looked out the kitchen
window and down at the street. The large shape of the summer sun had risen above
the sea and extended its heat over the city joined by a spring breeze.
	&quot;Do you want anything to eat?&quot; Michiru said asked as she entered the
kitchen, made a last adjustment to her cr&Atilde;&uml;me coloured blouse and flattened her
blue skirt against her thighs as Haruka turned to look at her.
	&quot;I don&#39;t have any appetite.&quot; She tasted the coffee and leaned against
the window. &quot;You look pretty today.&quot; She looked sideways at her wife and raised
her eyebrows.
	Michiru opened the fridge with a annoyed sigh and avoided Haruka&#39;s
inquiring gaze. &quot;I have a meeting today, regarding the reopening of the
theatre.&quot; She said as she regarded the contents of the fridge. &quot;Anything else to
complain about?&quot; She took the butter, cheese and a tomato before she looked at
Haruka.
	Haruka had a steady stare into the darkness of her coffee-cup. She
inhaled and separated her lips and a false calm came to her face. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
She said and carefully looked up to regard Michiru&#39;s back. &quot;I just have a ghost
in my gear.&quot; A thin smile arrived on her lips as Michiru returned a glance while
taking a bite from a piece of cheese.
	&quot;I married you.&quot; Michiru said luring Haruka to join by her side and lean
against the bench. &quot;So why would I need anyone else?&quot; She reached for a knife
and brought it to rest on the red skin of the tomato. &quot;I spend each day wanting
to come home to you, your bad mood, bad breath.&quot;
	Haruka smiled while she regarded the cute sandwich Michiru was making
now complete with slices of tomato. &quot;Do you want me to drive you to work?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;ll take the subway.&quot; She took a bite of the sandwich then began
packing the groceries back into the refrigerator. &quot;Maybe you should get some
rest.&quot;
	Haruka took a few gulps of coffee. &quot;I need to work on the Mazda, there
is something up with the carburettor.&quot; She followed the movement of Michiru&#39;s
jawbone as she chewed. &quot;And I&#39;m gonna go shopping for groceries.&quot;
	&quot;Good.&quot; Michiru said and poured some tea into a cup then looked at
Haruka again. &quot;But I still think you should rest.&quot; She added a smiled and
pleaded with her eyes.
	&quot;I will try.&quot; Haruka reached for Michiru and touched her waist, caught
it between four fingers and a thumb and squeezed it while she leaned forward and
kissed her lovers forehead.
	Michiru took a embarrassing bite of her sandwich as Haruka released her,
she chewed carefully while looking at Haruka as she left the room. Probably
needed to pee again, she thought then washed the bread down with some tea. She
had always liked being kissed by Haruka and hoped that would never change. Their
relationship had changed after Haruka became pregnant and Michiru hoped they
could adjust on it. Felt like there was so much more she could do for Haruka.
She closed her eyes calmly, she had caused Haruka much worry and it was not
until today that her spouse had voiced her concern. How could her love for
Haruka ever decrease? She swallowed the bread then sighed.
	&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Haruka asked as she poured the remains in her coffee
mug into the sink while she looked at her wife deep in thoughts.
	Michiru smiled. &quot;Nothing. I was just thinking of you.&quot; She stuffed the
last of the sandwich into her mouth then sipped some tea from her cup with
careful lips.
	Haruka looked out the kitchen window while she smiled. &quot;Will you be late
tonight?&quot; Her voice was as soft as she could make it as she in the corner of her
eye saw Michiru chew like a maniac to faster deliver her reply.
	&quot;I will try to get home early, do you want me to cook?&quot; Michiru placed
her cup in the sink beside her lovers mug and afterwards she calmly met Haruka&#39;s
gaze. A tension was brought to her lips as she leaned forward, kissed her wife
then after it had ended excused herself with her entire face. &quot;I need to get
going. I&#39;ll see you tonight.&quot;
	Haruka nodded then followed Michiru to the hall. &quot;I will try to rest a
little before you come home.&quot; A smile brought the excuse of her heart to her
face. &quot;So I don&#39;t fall asleep so early.&quot;
	Michiru released a laughter as she slipped into her shoes. &quot;Remember
that I love you.&quot;
