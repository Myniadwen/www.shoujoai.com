<h1>Unstoppable Force Meets Immovable Object (part 12 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krampus.html">Krampus</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/unstop-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><p><u>Astounded</u></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>In a rare show of wakefulness, Minako was 
waiting and all set to go when Rei knocked on the door Monday morning.</p><p>"Morning," she 
said a little breathlessly.</p><p>Rei grinned. "You're ready already? Where does this 
enthusiasm come from, I wonder?"</p><p>Minako smiled coyly, struggling to keep from pulling 
the smirking miko in to kiss her senseless. "You'll find out." She slipped her school bag 
over her should and called, "Bye, Mom!"</p><p>Like magic, her mother zoomed into the room 
instantly. Minako wouldn't have been surprised if the woman had been lurking around the 
corner listening.</p><p>"You're leaving for school early, Minako?" The elder blonde checked 
her watch. "Nearly fifteen minutes. What's the occasion?"</p><p>Minako fidgeted. 
"Nothing."</p><p>"Minako Aino, don't you get all shifty and tell me it's nothing!" As an 
aside, she said to Rei, "See, she can't stand still when she lies to me. It's a wonderfully 
revealing habit."</p><p>With a groan, Minako rolled her eyes and threw her hands up. "Why 
are you giving us the third degree!"</p><p>"Oh not Rei, just you, dear. Rei's always on 
time." She shot the miko an approving smile.</p><p>The blonde girl gave her mother a deeply 
peeved look. "Well today I'm on time, too."</p><p>"Yes, and I'd like to know 
why."</p><p>"There is no reason! You're going to make us late for being early!" Minako 
huffed.</p><p>"Fine, fine," her mother said affably. "Don't tell me. Have your little 
secrets. Rei will tell me, won't you, Rei?" Minako's mother turned her bright blue eyes on 
the miko, who froze like a deer in the headlights.</p><p>"I, er . . ."</p><p>"No, she 
won't." Minako frowned at both of them and stepped out the door. "Goodbye, <i>Mother</i>," 
she stressed, and under her breath mumbled, "you crazy old bag."</p><p>"Have a good day at 
school, Rei," Mrs Aino said, pulling the dark haired girl in for a hug before she could 
escape.</p><p>Red faced from trying to contain both her laughter and embarrassment, Rei 
nodded and smiled slightly, "I, um, yep. I will."</p><p>Minako cleared her throat and shot 
her girlfriend a peeved look.</p><p>Rei just grinned and shrugged her shoulders. The 
volleyball captain turned on her heel and made for the car moodily. "Bye, Mrs Aino," Rei 
said politely, and followed her irritated girlfriend.</p><p>"She's nuts," Minako growled, 
slamming her door and wrenching her seatbelt on.</p><p>"She's funny." Rei waved back at Mrs 
Aino standing on the porch and backed out of the driveway.</p><p>"It must be senility," she 
grumbled. Rei laughed, and Minako snapped, "What?"</p><p>"I think you're afraid you'll grow 
into her."</p><p>"I what?" Minako folded her arms and Rei began to chuckle. "I- no. 
Absolutely no. Just â€“ oh, shut up."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"It's this Thursday but you 
don't have to come, Minako. It'll be pretty boring," Rei said quietly, her mouth just next 
to Minako's ear. The TV was quietly rolling music and credits to their finished movie in 
the background.</p><p>"But it's your sport - I have to come cheer for you. And you didn't 
seem to mind going with Erika..." The blonde fidgeted on the couch. Lying with her back 
pressed to Rei's front, their legs comfortably entwined, she couldn't see the frown appear 
on the other girl's face.</p><p>"Uh yeah I did." Rei argued a little uncomfortably. She 
went on <i>one</i> date while they were apart and Minako had to bring it up. "I nearly feel 
asleep." <i>And how many people did you go out with during that time</i>? she wanted to 
ask.</p><p>Minako's tone rose questioningly. "You were bored? But you love archery, oh 
still and serious one." Her body went taut and she mimed holding an arrow notched to a 
bow.</p><p>"I like to do it, not watch it. And I do not look like that." Rei pinned 
Minako's arms to her sides in a hug.</p><p>The blonde giggled and squirmed around until 
they were facing. Suddenly they seemed much closer than before. Rei's brooding was nipped 
in the bud once a gleeful smile was turned her way but she maintained a lofty expression. 
It wouldn't do to let the blonde know she could disarm her without trying. Really, that 
would be the end of Rei.</p><p>"You think my impression was off?" Minako asked, her tone 
just a little sly.</p><p>"All wrong," Rei sniffed. "Horribly wrong." She stiffened a little 
when hands took hold of her sides, fingers curling at the exposed skin at her 
waist.</p><p>"I guess I'll have to try harder," Minako suggested in a silvery murmur. 
"Study my subject more closely." Turning her head to place her lips at Rei's ear, she 
asked, "What do you think?"</p><p>The playful atmosphere of their banter dissolved and Rei 
was transfixed. <i>I think your flirting is far too effective</i>.</p><p>Grandpa was in the 
other room, her brain reminded her. The walls were quite thin, it also pointed out. <i>I 
think if we could just make out for a few minutes it might be worth getting 
caught</i>...</p><p>Minako's eyes were half-lidded and it occurred to Rei that they were 
staring like they were starved for each other. <i>I think we're thinking the same 
thing</i>.</p><p>As if to prove that they were indeed on the same wavelength, their lips 
met midway. Sensual and slow, easing into each other hot and craving and</p><p>Vibrating 
against her thigh startled Rei, making her jump so hard she nearly climbed the back of the 
couch. Letting out a string of stuttered curses and a rant against "Phones! Goddamn 
cellphones and-and-and that stupid that-that <i>buzzy</i> thing they do!" Rei huffed and 
sat up while Minako took the call and tried not to laugh.</p><p>"Hi mum."</p><p>Fuming 
silently so as to not be overheard, Rei busied herself ejecting the DVD to return it to its 
case and turning off the neglected television.</p><p>"Yeah, I'll be back for dinner. Yeah. 
I'm just leaving now." She shot Rei a pouty look. "Mmhmm. See you in like half an hour. 
Kay. Bye!"</p><p>Minako hung up and met Rei's baleful stare with her unflappable amusement. 
"<i>Buzzy thing</i>? Tch. And you get after me for blinkybob."</p><p>Growling, Rei threw 
her hands up and stalked out of the room. <i>I think I may strangle this girl</i>...</p><hr 
size=1 noshade><p>The surreptitious rustling of papers and zipping of bags began as a 
furtive signal and sure enough, the lunch bell rang seconds later. All silent stealth was 
abandoned and the thundering of footsteps grew. Rei contributed to the ambient noise by 
putting away her own binders and pen before joining the stream of bodies that flowed and 
jostled through the corridors.</p><p>Her friends from homeroom would be eating in their 
designated classroom as usual and the miko made her way to her locker on autopilot, set on 
grabbing the lunch she had packed and joining them there. The boy with the locker next to 
hers smiled at her and she returned his greeting with a perfunctory one of her own. Rei 
then began arranging her books neatly in their shelves as though absorbed by the task, 
pretending not to notice that the boy (<i>Hibiki? Hikaru?</i>) was about to say something 
further.</p><p>Escaping before he (<i>Hotaru?</i>) could voice his scintillating morsel of 
small-talk, Rei headed down the usual hallways, destined for her homeroom. Such a 
destination was not to be reached that day, however, as a rowdy herd of students advanced, 
laughing and yelling and coming her way. Looking straight ahead, she identified a few of 
the loud kids as footballers from her peripheral and ignored their appraising 
stares.</p><p>Just as she was nearly clear of this riotous mob of idiots, an arm shot out 
and grabbed her by the elbow. Scowling and poised to deliver her most withering glare, Rei 
turned around to confront the grinning face of a very familiar blonde.</p><p>"You have 
lunch now?" Minako asked.</p><p>Like the flip of a switch, Rei's irritation vanished. She 
nodded and suddenly found herself being tugged back in the direction she had come 
from.</p><p>"Let's go," Minako said with a wink. Turning back to her friends, she pressed 
her fist to her chest and gave a peace sign. "P-sauce on the izzout!"</p><p>Kagura looked 
up from the conversation she'd been in with some boy and chuckled at the bubbly blonde's 
attempted gangsta farewell. "Go on," the volleyball player shooed. "We didn't want you here 
anyway."</p><p>Ditching her friends and forcing Rei to ditch hers, Minako steered them out 
a set of double doors and toward the athletics fields. Gym classes were using most of the 
space but on the hills and near trees, little groups of people were eating their 
lunches.</p><p>"I didn't think you had this lunch period," Rei commented.</p><p>"I don't," 
the blonde confessed without guilt. "I'm skipping chem."</p><p>She rolled her eyes. "And 
how are you doing in that class? As I recall, your mom said something about-"</p><p>"Never 
mind my mother," Minako scoffed. "I'm passing. I'm happy."</p><p>Satisfied with that 
answer, she moved on. "Do you have lunch next period?" When the blonde nodded, an idea 
occurred to Rei that had never tempted her before. "Do you wanna go somewhere?"</p><p>Pale 
brows furrowed in confusion. "Don't you have class in forty minutes?"</p><p>Rei hesitated - 
was this a good idea? What if she got in trouble? Was it worth it? It only took a couple 
seconds for her to realise that the answer could be summed up quite simply: Screw it. Her 
lips curled upward and a glint of uncommon mischief appeared in her dark violet 
eyes.</p><p>Catching on, a similar grin spread on Minako's face and she laughed aloud. 
"I've finally corrupted you!"</p><p>With a scoff, Rei grabbed her hand and pulled Minako up 
with her. Laughing quietly, they scurried away from the school to spend their hours as they 
pleased.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"I think we should make a wager on your 
tournament."</p><p>"Really."</p><p>"Yeah! What do you want if you win?"</p><p>"A 
pony."</p><p>"Come on, Rei! Seriously, you need a prize if you do well! 
Incentive!"</p><p>"Eh. Whatever. 'Winning is its own reward' right?"</p><p>"Bahhh boring. 
How about Hinoland? I just know you've been dying for a corner of my room. Seen you eyeing 
it I have."</p><p>"Uhh not really. I don't seem to have the same territorial drive as 
you..."</p><p>"Okay, how about this - if you win I'll give you a full-body 
massage."</p><p>"Minako!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"What nothing! And would you stop wiggling 
your fingers like that!"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"It's- it's obscene!"</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"You 
know how!"</p><p>"When?"</p><p>"...What?"</p><p>"No, already did what. I win. And if you 
bomb at the tournament you have to lube <i>me</i> up and rub."</p><p>"...You just love 
making me uncomfortable don't you?"</p><p>"Yep. Now shake on it-"</p><p>"Aa! Let go! I'm 
driving, you lunatic-"</p><p>"There, deal!"</p><p>"Huh. Fine. But just so you know I've 
never given anyone a massage so you're hardly in for a treat."</p><p>"Nah I'll just have to 
show you how first..."</p><p>"Why do I get the feeling you wouldn't mind losing this 
wager?"</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Minako slammed the door to the passenger side of the car a 
little harder than necessary, amped by the prospect of skipping class with her girlfriend. 
Rei, her <i>girlfriend</i>. She looked over at said friendly-girl, expecting a flat stare 
for the treatment of her car but the driver was sitting static in her seat, contemplating 
her unturned keys in the ignition.</p><p>"So where are we going?" Minako wondered. Rei 
could have told her the library or a manure processing plant and it likely wouldn't have 
dimmed her enthusiasm. Bookshelves were good for making out behind and as for dung, well . 
. . Rei would be there so yay! However, they did not seem to be going anywhere as the other 
girl flushed a little in self-consciousness and her fingers started drumming on the 
steering wheel.</p><p>"Um." Taptaptap. "Well." Tappitytap. "I . . . hadn't planned that far 
ahead."</p><p>"Too eager to run away with me?" Minako teased, her voice and smile light as 
she leaned over the centre console between them.</p><p>She stopped halfway and took in the 
entrancing sight of Rei's blush darkening a shade, her lips quirked sheepishly. Often 
hypnotised by the miko's gaze for the force of character behind it and the way the colour 
glimmered as if waiting for the right light to reveal its richest shade of violet, Minako 
fancied Rei's eyes to be even lovelier when they held that unique glint of affection 
reserved only for her. It was there every time Rei dipped toward her for a kiss, as she was 
doing now.</p><p>Their lips met twice, soft and lingering.</p><p>"Suggestions?" Rei 
inquired a little breathlessly.</p><p>"Mmm. More kisses."</p><p>Rei let the hand slipping 
into her hair pull her lips back to Minako's, resistance the furthest, most futile notion 
in existence. She palmed the slender curve of the blonde's neck, pausing to feel the 
quickened pulse jump under fingers when she traced the tip of her tongue along Minako's 
bottom lip. A breathy sound of encouragement rushed past that lip as it parted from its 
mate and Minako deepened the kiss, welcoming the wet intrusion with strokes of her own 
tongue. With expertise and tenderness, she caressed and lightly sucked at the slick muscle 
in her mouth, drawing a choked groan from the dark haired girl. Minako swallowed a moan of 
her own in answer to that utterly arousing sound and shivered at the heat it conjured in 
her body.</p><p>Her hands clenched restlessly, tugging dark hairs. Rei gasped. Minako's 
fingers dropped to a shirt button at her collar and fondled it for a moment before making 
up her mind. She pulled back and they both caught their breath.</p><p>"Right. Okay. So . . 
. Other suggestions," Rei prompted.</p><p><i>Thinking</i>? Rei wanted her to think of stuff 
after that? "Uhhh," she supplied.</p><p>"Eheh umm," the other girl replied.</p><p>"I could 
sit here and annoy you - that's always fun," Minako offered.</p><p>Rei scoffed. "That's the 
default. I was hoping for something new."</p><p>"Well if the prospect of making out kills 
your ability to come up with ideas, then the act definitely does it for me." She 
shrugged.</p><p>"Great," Rei deadpanned. "So we get dumb around each other."</p><p>Minako 
smiled widely. "Exactly! Nothing beats being stupid with you."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Rei 
opened her front door and filled her lungs with the fresh air from outside, detecting the 
rich, warm scent of spring. The season was right on time, thawing out the city and hinting 
at the summer to come. <i>And the exams to come</i>, Rei grumbled inwardly, already growing 
resigned to the weeks of studying that were just around the corner.</p><p>Bare footsteps 
behind her made the miko turn and smile when her eyes were immediately caught by Minako's 
gaze.</p><p>"Got everything?" she asked.</p><p>The blonde nodded and knelt down to put her 
shoes on, her long hair cascading over her shoulder. Rei watched the small, deft movements 
of Minako's hands as she tied her laces and she abandoned her worries over 
exams.</p><p>"You sure you don't want me to drive you?"</p><p>The tips of blonde strands 
swept the floor as Minako shook her head. "It's not that far by transit and gas is 
pricey."</p><p>"I can afford it," Rei grumbled.</p><p>The cheeky answer that came with a 
grin was, "Save it. Buy me presents instead."</p><p>Rei just snorted in reply, which they 
both noted was not a refusal. Stepping out onto her front porch, she looked west, gauging 
the sunlight left and sighed, realising it was still light enough that she couldn't insist 
that Minako accept a ride. When the blonde joined her on the porch, adjusting her schoolbag 
over her shoulder, Minako noticed the glum expression on the other girl's face and sought 
to fix it. Before Rei could dodge them, two fingers found the corners of her lips and 
forced them upward into a strange grimace.</p><p>Scowling, Rei pulled her head back while 
Minako chuckled, "Don't be upset. You'll see me first thing in the morning 
tomorrow."</p><p>"Can't wait," she deadpanned.</p><p>"Goodnight, Rei." Minako smiled and 
leaned in.</p><p>"Goodnight," Rei murmured before her lips were caught in a brief kiss. 
Blue eyes glimmered happily from inches away and the miko was hit by a memory that both 
mirrored and shadowed this one. Then, those same eyes had glinted with triumph as their 
owner pulled away, breathless and pleased. The two of them had been inside saying their 
goodnights when Minako's parting kiss had come in a much lengthier, more rigourous form of 
farewell including tongues and firm hands in dark hair.</p><p>This chaste kiss just now was 
another sign in a growing procession of signs that the reigns of Minako's control had 
tightened around her. Rei could see the longing held in check in the involuntary flutter of 
blue eyes down to her lips and the brief hesitation before Minako placed a proper distance 
between them again.</p><p>The blonde got one step past Rei when the ruminative girl 
clutched her wrist, halting her exit.<i> Minako,</i> Rei mused,<i> though mischievous and 
hyper . . . </i>"You're . . ." She struggled momentarily for the word she wanted but 
stopped, stumped by the infinitude of inadequate possibilities. There was no single term 
that could capture the warmth and compassion of this infuriating, joyously flippant girl 
who could blend the most extraordinary sensitivity with the blithe, juggernaut energy of a 
party in full swing.</p><p>Smiling faintly, Rei tugged. "Come here."</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>Minako just flapped a hand. "It can't be that hard - everybody does 
it."</p><p>"Yeah but most people are <i>bad</i> at it," Rei retorted. "Hence the hundreds 
of accidents everyday."</p><p>"Bah." Minako maintained her flippant demeanour, continuing 
to prod and stoke the miko's argumentative nature. "Go pedal, stop pedal, turny thing - 
piece a cake!" She could practically see the brain rupture taking place behind incredulous 
purple irises at her renaming of a steering wheel - a particularly well-crafted turn of 
phrase if she did say so herself. Heading off the irate sputtering that was boiling to 
Rei's lips, she added, "I even know about the blinkybobbers! Though the hooter is 
definitely my favourite."</p><p>Rei just glared at her for a moment, one eye giving a 
twitch that Minako happily counted as a sign of her mission accomplished. Annoyed-to-death 
Rei was sexy - all smouldery eyes and arrogant head-tilt - and especially hot considering 
the expression was all of Minako's crafty engineering. Ah, if only the miko knew that even 
in the early days her glares had evoked a rather opposite effect on the blonde than 
intended.</p><p>Said glare was directed forward suddenly as Rei started the car, apparently 
having decided on their next destination.</p><p>"You forgot your blinkybob," Minako 
helpfully pointed out as they took a left out of the lot. Oooo she'd never seen that 
lip-curl before. A thrill of discovery shot through her as she waded into uncharted 
territories. And then she realised they weren't taking the usual route toward her house or 
the shrine. "Ehhh where are we going?"</p><p>The first tendrils of trepidation crept in at 
Rei's dark smirk. "We're going to an empty lot," she answered ominously.</p><p>Two 
possibilities presented themselves immediately to Minako, the first and most likely was 
"For a driving lesson?"</p><p>"To bury your corpse," Rei growled, electing the second 
choice.</p><p>She seemed to think this over. "After a driving lesson?"</p><p>"Sure," the 
miko acquiesced. "I am merciful - I'll grant your final request."</p><p>Minako just 
chuckled. The miko called <i>her</i> melodramatic but she had her own flare for the 
theatrical when it suited her. Her promise of an empty lot was no act, however, and twenty 
minutes later found them at the outskirts of the city in a near-vacant parking lot behind a 
furniture store.</p><p>Throwing the car into park in the middle of the lot, Rei turned off 
the car and dangled the keys between them. "Well?"</p><p>Minako hesitated. Really? Rei was 
trusting the fate of her car to <i>her</i>? Well sure she was a good athlete and not bad at 
video games but she wasn't sure how much that counted for behind the wheel.</p><p>"You're 
not scared, are you?" Rei asked, wearing an infuriating smirk.</p><p>She internally shook 
her fist at Rei for goading her when the miko knew perfectly well she wouldn't be able to 
back down from it. Gaining an evil grin of her own, Minako returned, "You're the one who 
should be scared. Say good bye to your car." She swiped the keys from Rei's hands and got 
out of the car, listening to Rei sputter a bit as she walked around the hood.</p><p>"You 
asked for it," Minako pointed out as she opened the driver's side door and assumed an 
expectant pose, hand on cocked hip.</p><p>Looking perturbed, Rei slid over to the 
passenger's side and quickly pulled her seat belt on. The blonde wasted no time in hopping 
behind the wheel and buckling in. Just like she saw the miko do every morning, she pushed 
the key into the ignition and cranked, held it for a second, and released to the roar of 
the engine settling to a purr.</p><p>Then a thrill went through her. What to do now? So 
much <i>power</i> at her command! Looking through the windshield, Minako decided on a path 
that would take them toward the least cars parked in the fairly empty lot. No need to give 
her girlfriend fits . . . right away. With a jaunty grin at her terror-stricken passenger, 
she cranked the wheel to the right and pushed the gas.</p><p>The engine rumbled but 
movement did not happen. "Strange." Minako put a hand to her chin and contemplated the 
machinery before her. Next to her, she could hear Rei's hand connect with her 
forehead.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>It was still baffling to Minako that she was growing 
familiar with these lips - the very lips whose texture and taste she had once spent hours 
guessing at and contemplating in the listless moments before sleep. And then later, after 
the months apart, those same sleepy minutes had found her straining to remember what it was 
like to kiss Rei only to realise that she had never appreciated it enough to notice the 
details that made up the encounter.</p><p>Rei's lips parted from hers and she paused a 
moment before opening her eyes and responding to the satisfied smile on Rei's face. The 
miko had certainly caught her by surprise and Minako was still reeling from the unforeseen 
make-out session, dazed and happily enraptured.</p><p>"Hmm - still light out. I was hoping 
we would make it to sundown," Rei murmured.</p><p>"You're the one who stopped," Minako 
purred, her eyes dropping to the little cleft at the corner of Rei's lips that appeared 
when she smirked.</p><p>There was a heartbeat of hesitation between them where they both 
could have leaned in again and made it to nightfall for certain but Minako managed to 
remember the world outside of Rei and her parents waiting at home. She pressed a quick kiss 
to hungry lips before dropping her arms from around Rei's neck and stepping back to a 
conversational distance.</p><p>"Wish I hadn't."</p><p>Smiling at the genuine regret she 
could detect in the joking reply, she teased, "This may be the closest I've seen you come 
to pouting."</p><p>Dark, slender brows slanted downward. "I do not pout," she 
claimed.</p><p>"Ha! You totally-"</p><p>"Come over this Friday."</p><p>Forgetting about 
goading her girlfriend, Minako blinked at the non-sequitur and Rei added, "You can sleep 
over. Do you want to?"</p><p>Minako instantly jumped tracks from stunned to ecstatic. 
"Yes!"</p><p>Rei laughed and gave her a final kiss. "Good. Now go before you miss 
dinner."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"I'm gonna try reverse now!" Minako declared.</p><p>"Oh 
god no . . ." Rei groaned to her right, one hand clutching the grab handle, the other 
braced against the dashboard.</p><p>Minako figured she was doing pretty well so far. There 
had been a few near misses with some parked cars but the pedals were starting to make sense 
now and the wheel seemed to work all right. She stopped the car - left pedal! - and looked 
down at the magic stick in the centre that she had forgotten before. With confidence, she 
pushed it to the R position and switched her foot to the other pedal.</p><p>Whoakay they 
were going backwards, yes they were and ouch the seatbelt had jarred against her collarbone 
rather harshly.</p><p>"Aaaaa slow down!"</p><p>Looking at the rearview mirror seemed to 
suggest they were headed for a blue van and turning to look out the back confirmed it. No 
panic! Minako cranked the wheel left and the car swung roughly to the . . . Right? There 
was a thud followed by cursing, which Minako had come to recognise as Rei's head connecting 
with either the dashboard or window. She wondered if she should be concerned as it had 
happened a few times already.</p><p>"Jesus fuck!"</p><p>No time to worry about concussions 
now though as someone else had foolishly left their car right in her way. But now Minako 
was a little wary of this reverse business as it seemed to make the car do strange things. 
She tried dodging the car but had to sharply correct and steer the other way, resulting in 
a whole lot of thudding. Was left right now? What was right? Left?</p><p>"No more reverse!" 
Rei barked.</p><p>Minako stomped the brake. Ah so that was still the same. The magic bar 
went back to D and down went the gas pedal. But now disorientation set in. Which way 
steered which? And the blue van was looming again!</p><p>"Less gas you cra<i>aaaa look 
out</i>!"</p><p>Taking a guess she cranked the wheel one way - and was heading for a smart 
car! No! She spun the wheel around in the reverse direction and the car headed right to 
safety. But wait, was that the way she'd turned the wheel?</p><p>Minako turned to Rei for 
help. "Now I'm confused! Which way is which? Which way is which!" she cried as the car 
headed for a low-lying divider in the middle of the lot.</p><p>"Left is left!" Rei 
bellowed. "Right is right! Go left! <i>GO LEFT!</i> BRAKE!" Rei screamed as the car's right 
side rode up on the concrete curb. She was thrown back, her head clipping the edge of the 
driver's seat when the opposite pedal was stomped. "I said brake! 
<i>Brake!</i>"</p><p>Minako found the right pedal and Rei flew forward, her shoulder 
connecting sharply with the dashboard and her elbow jabbing the radio.</p><p>"-<i>ust beat 
iiiit! Beat iiit! Beat iiit! Beat iiit! No one wants ta be defea-</i>"</p><p>Her fist 
smashed the radio's power button but did not unclench afterward and Rei seemed to stare 
down at her tense knuckles for a while. Then Rei's hand moved slowly to the magic middle 
stick and put it to P before retracting to her lap where the dark haired girl continued to 
stare at it. The car was motionless. Safe.</p><p>Minako stayed still and silent, wondering 
if her moody girl was truly mad this time. She didn't <i>think</i> she'd broken the car . . 
. Though there had been a sort of scrapey noise on the bottom. Maybe a few 
scratches?</p><p>"Never. Again." Rei's voice shook a little and when she looked up the 
blonde realised she wasn't angry, she'd just had the bejesus scared out of her. "My god, 
never, never, <i>never</i> again!"</p><p>"Agreed," Minako said quickly to soothe her poor 
Rei.</p><p>"Worst idea ever," she muttered to herself. "Not even safe in an open field . . 
. What if there'd been people around? . . . The blood, oh there would have been blood . . . 
Babies . . . Forest fires . . . Giant sharks and a typhoon and-"</p><p>"Rei?"</p><p>Haunted 
eyes turned her way. A spark lit and Rei grabbed Minako by the shoulders. "Promise me you 
will never drive again!"</p><p>"Promise!" Minako complied immediately, ignoring the future 
where she may want a license. Best to go along with the crazy lady until she recovered from 
her trauma.</p><p>As Minako hoped, this seemed to pacify Rei. "And I swear to never put you
