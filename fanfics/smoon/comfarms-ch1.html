fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meikosama.html">Azfixiation</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Does anyone know where Mako-chan is? I haven&#39;t seen her all day. It&#39;s
not like her to not be in school.&quot; Ami asked while the sailor senshi
enjoyed their brief lunch break.

&quot;Well Minako? Where&#39;s she at?&quot; Rei figured Minako would be the only
to know where Makoto was. Those two were practically inseparable
lately.

&quot;How should I know? Maybe she&#39;s sick.&quot; Minako stared off into space
as she thought about where her best friend was. &quot;I&#39;ll go by her apartment
after school and check on her.&quot;

&quot;What about our study session?&quot; Usagi asked knowing full well Minako
was probably just using Makoto as a reason to skip studying.

&quot;Makoto is more important to me than school. Besides it won&#39;t kill me
to miss one day of studying.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll come with you after school.&quot; Usagi said hopefully, wanting to
get out of studying as well.

&quot;No way odango. You need to study. After all, you did fail that last test
we had didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Do you have to bring that up Rei-chan?&quot;

&quot;Only because I want you to do good in school Usagi.&quot;

&quot;Fine, but Minako, if anything really is wrong with Makoto let us know
ne?&quot;

&quot;Un.&quot; was all Minako said. She was still to busy thinking about her best
friend, who had come to mean so much more to her than anything else
in the world.

The rest of the day at school was rather uneventful for Minako. She had
a very one-track mind, and right now it was to busy imagining what it
would be like to be holding Makoto. To kiss her, and be loved by her.
&quot;If only..&quot; Minako whispered to herself as the final bell rung dismissing
her for the day.

The walk to Makoto&#39;s seemed extremely long to Minako. She was
hoping that Makoto was all right and finally remembered why her friend
hadn&#39;t been in school that day. As the realization of what day it was hit
her, she started to run, as fast as she could to her friend&#146;s house.

Once she reached Makoto&#39;s apartment she didn&#39;t bother to even knock
as she noticed the door was unlocked. &quot;Mako-chan? Are you home?&quot;
Minako called out as she cautiously stepped into the apartment. When
there was no answer Minako began to worry. She walked around the
apartment looking for her friend when she heard soft cries.

She immediately went into Makoto&#39;s bedroom to find her clutching a
picture of her parents crying. &quot;Oh. Makoto, why didn&#39;t you tell us?&quot;
Minako said startling the toughest senshi, who seemed as fragile as
porcelain at the moment. Makoto just looked at her blankly trying to
hide her tears.

&quot;Gomen ne, Minako. I just didn&#39;t want you to worry about me.&quot;

&quot;Baka, I always worry about you.&quot; Minako moved to sit on the floor
next to her friend and hugged her tightly. &#147;You&#146;re my best friend; it&#146;s as
much my duty to protect you as it is to protect Sailor Moon. I love you
Mako-chan; I&#39;ll always be here for you.&quot; Minako paused for a minute
wondering if she just said too much. What would Makoto do if she ever
figured out just how true that was?

Makoto smiled through her tears and held on tighter to her friend. &quot;I
love you too Minako.&quot; Makoto didn&#39;t care if Minako saw her so fragile.
Normally she wouldn&#39;t let anyone see her like this but she&#39;d come to
need Minako way too much. And right now she just wanted to be with
her, to be held by her like she was now.

Reluctantly Minako released her hold on her friend and looked at her.
&quot;You didn&#39;t sleep at all last night did you?&quot; Makoto just looked away
and Minako knew the answer. &quot;Come on, you need to get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t. If I close my eyes, it&#39;s all I see. I remember them dying, the
people telling me..everything..it&#39;s just so vivid. It&#39;s too scary for me.&quot;
When Makoto broke into tears again Minako&#39;s heart broke. She felt
helpless and couldn&#39;t stand it. Taking Makoto&#39;s hand into her own she
stood up bringing Makoto with her.

&quot;Just try, for me. You need to get some sleep. I&#39;ll stay in here with you.&#148;

&quot;I..&quot; Makoto didn&#39;t even have a chance to protest. Minako pulled her
over to the bed and made her lay down. Much to Makoto&#39;s surprise
Minako lay down next to her on the bed and wrapped her arms around
Makoto.

Minako noticed Makoto&#39;s confused look, and with a shaky voice told
her she was holding her just so Makoto knew she was there, and there
was nothing to worry about. In a way, Minako knew she was using
Makoto&#39;s state of mind just to get closer to her and while she felt
terrible about it, at the same time she could tell that Makoto needed that
from her. That right now Makoto needed that physical contact.

After almost an hour had gone by Minako could tell Makoto had fallen
asleep. When Minako heard her stomach begin to grumble she
reluctantly left Makoto&#39;s embrace and got up to find some food for
herself. Eventually she settled for some ramen, which seemed to be the
only thing she knew how to cook that Makoto had.

&quot;Minako?&quot; Makoto whispered as she woke up alone in her dark room.
She could have sworn Minako was there holding her when she went to
sleep but she couldn&#39;t be sure in the state she was in. She glanced over
at her clock and noticed she had only been sleeping for twenty minutes.

When she caught a smell of the food Minako had cooked she knew she
wasn&#39;t dreaming. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and got out of bed
to find her friend. When Makoto saw her friend washing her dishes in
the sink she got brave and quietly walked up behind Minako and
wrapped her arms around the blonde.

Minako tensed for a second but relaxed in Makoto&#39;s arms rather fast and
turned around to look at her friend. &#147;You&#146;re supposed to be sleeping.&#148;
Minako reminded her friend as she rested her head on Makoto&#39;s
shoulder letting Makoto hold her still.

&quot;I told you I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep.&quot; Makoto held on tighter to
Minako.

&quot;But you did for a while.&quot;

&quot;But then you left and I woke up. Come back to bed with me and I&#39;ll be
able to go to sleep.&quot; When Minako looked up into Makoto&#39;s eyes she
realized something...Makoto looked at her in the same way she looked
at Makoto. Her eyes were full of love and devotion. Makoto loved
Minako in the way Minako had dreamed...and now was the chance to
make her dreams come true.

Taking hold of Makoto&#39;s hand, Minako silently led the two back to
Makoto&#39;s room and they lay back down in the same fashion as before.
Minako was lying on her back, while Makoto was on her side, with her
head resting on Minako&#39;s shoulder and her arm wrapped around
Minako&#39;s waist. &quot;Mako-chan, I..I just want you to know I&#39;ll always be
here if you need me for anything...and that I love you.&quot;

&quot;Do you mean that Minako?&#39; Makoto looked up at her friend in the
dark.

&quot;Yes, more than anything.&quot;

Makoto started crying again and Minako worried she said too much.
When Makoto started to speak Minako couldn&#39;t believe the words
coming out of her mouth. &quot;I&#39;ve loved you for so long. With all my heart.
I never dreamed that my dream would come true. Thank you Minako.
Not only for loving me, but for making this day a little more bearable. I
love you and I want to be with you, forever.&quot;

Now it was Minako&#39;s turn to cry. She&#39;s been over this a million times in
her head. Now everything she thought she&#39;d say to Makoto just didn&#39;t
seem good enough, so she did the only thing she could think of. She
bent her head down towards Makoto&#39;s and ever so slowly brought her
lips to the other senshi&#39;s.

When the kiss ended the two lay silently in their embrace knowing no
other words were needed. They had forever and they just wanted to
enjoy the comfort of being close. Of being in love...
