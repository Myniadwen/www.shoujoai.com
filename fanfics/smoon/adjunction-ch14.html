<p><em>That  was when she, of course, chose to look up.</em></p>
<p><em>And recoiled,  hastily looking left and right as if she were a child who had  realized her parents had disappeared at the fair.</em></p>
<p><em>After all, it  couldn't have been </em>her <em>feet to take her in front of this  particular store, right?</em></p>
<p><em>Right.  She offhandedly looked through the window at the wares.</em></p>
<p><em>And  then vigorously shook herself, starting to turn away.</em></p>
<p>'How  absurd! Who and why would I be giving any diamond jewelry to?'</p>
<p>“Good  morning, can I help you with something?”</p>
<p>Rei  jerked her head up. An older woman was leaning against the door frame  to the store, smiling, or perhaps it would be better described as  grinning, at her.</p>
<p>The  priestess hastily waved her hands in protest. “Ah- no, no, not me.  I was just passing by.”</p>
<p>The  woman paused, as if evaluating her, before nodding in acceptance.  “Well, if you're sure. Feel free to come back any time, if you're  not busy, Hino-san.”</p>
<p>Rei  stopped in her attempt to back away. “H-how do you know my name?”</p>
<p>She  shrugged offhandedly. “Hino Rei, the local priestess that's braved  the front pages of our newspapers. I only know what others know.”</p>
<p>Rei  absently wondered if this was some sort of shop secret for getting  customers to come in.</p>
<p>Even  if it was, she wouldn't be the one to admit aloud that it might <em>possibly</em> be working.</p>
<p>The  shop lady, realizing that her target had stopped, smiled again and  straightened. “Hino-san? Have you changed your mind after all?”</p>
<p>At  that, Rei froze, before hurriedly shaking her head. She turned away.  “I-I have something to do n-now! G-Good day!”</p>
<p>The  woman grinned to herself as the priestess none-too-elegantly stalked  off. She walked back into the store, where she was met by the  questioning gaze of her partner at the cashier.</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>The  woman laughed and made a 'thumbs-up' sign afore heading towards the  back for her morning cup of coffee. “She'll be back. 1000 yen that  it'll be before the end of the week- no, the end of the day.”</p>
<p>The  cashier gave her a closed eye smile as she leaned against the glass  counter. “I'm not frivolous enough to go against your customer  intuition, Eika-chan. But to catch Hino Rei of all people... did you  see what she was looking at?”</p>
<p>A  hand popped out from around the corner of the doorframe. “Nothing  in particular; she seemed to only be in the beginning stages of  choosing something.”</p>
<p>Her  partner nodded thoughtfully. “Ne,” she called to the back, “Which  showcase should we put on for her today?”</p>
<p>There  was a pause, and then Eika responded, “CBNGOF-200. The Birthstone  edition. Ah, Rinka, where did you put the extra coffee filters?”</p>
<p>“On  the bottom shelf in the corner next to the spare cups. That one? Are  you sure, Eika? Why the Birthstone edition? And the CBNGOF line  is...”</p>
<p>Eika  poked her head into view with a grin, and for a moment, a fang  protruded from between her lips. “Hino-san is a priestess- most  donations go to the upkeep of her shrine, so she shouldn't have <em>that</em> much spare money on her; not for our regular wares. Aside from that,  there aren't any major gift giving holidays right now, and I don't  think Hino-san is the type of girl who would look for a Christmas  present more than a month in advance. So it's likely for an upcoming  birthday. Thus, you have our Cheap But Not Gaudy Or Fake line.  Y'see?”</p>
<p>Before Rinka could  answer, Eika went back to getting her coffee. The woman stared at the  open doorway before shaking her head in amazement. “You can't  underestimate the deductive reasoning of a detective's daughter, I  guess. I hope she's right; we need more business anyway.”</p>
<p>She went to unlock  the CBNGOF-200 case so as to place it in the special feature  compartment.</p>
<p>OOO...OOO...ooo...OOO...OOO</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rei's march had wound down  to a simple stroll, lost in thought as she headed in the general  direction of the shop she'd been planning to go to.</p>
<p><em>'Jewelry is too much... I mean...  Minako is... no matter how I...'</em></p>
<p>A flash of a memory  brought her back to an interview she had taped of the idol.</p>
<p><em>Jewelry? Mm,  yes, of course I'm fond of it- how many girls aren't? What's my  favorite? Hmm... I've worn a lot, and each stone and style has its  perks... well... I guess it's Topaz after all? </em>She laughed. <em>Favoritism towards my favorite color I guess?</em></p>
<p>Rei shook her head,  walking hurriedly past the double doors of the store, not realizing  she'd started stomping again.</p>
<p><em>'Besides that, why am I even  thinking about Minako? All I did was look through a shop window... I  do that all the time!'</em></p>
<p>Rei glanced at the  bottle in her hand, and realized that she had somehow accidentally  picked up a bottle of the famous import Vi- she nearly threw the  bottle back onto the shelf in her haste to separate herself from that  which made her cheeks a flaming red.</p>
<p><em>'Wrong aisle, wrong aisle, wrong  aisle- for the love of Kami-sama!'</em></p>
<p>She looked up at the aisle sign this  time before embarking on the first step to her hunt for  things-to-once-again-clean-up-after-Usagi-the-tornado.</p>
<p>As she was stepping out of that aisle,  she caught sight of a pyramid of stuffed animals. Among that, she  caught sight of a white cat plushie, though, upon closer inspection,  she knew it wasn't like Artemis at all.</p>
<p><em>'The Artemis-special-edition replica  plushie I found last year was of much better quality than this- AUGH!  Stop it! I'm just thinking of things related to Minako again!  Enough!'</em></p>
<p>By the time she  left the store an hour later, bags laden with the necessary cleaning  supplies, she was huffing in a guarded, yet agitated, way.</p>
<p>But then, what else  could be expected, when she had ended up trying to time herself on  how long she could operate without thinking of anything  Minako-related, and repeatedly failed?</p>
<p>By the time she had  reached the last store she needed to pay a visit to, her grandiose  record was exactly...</p>
<p>Eleven minutes and  ten seconds.</p>
<p>It could not have  helped that advertisement of Minako Aino was doubled and even tripled  in places in honor of her return for this week.</p>
<p>Usagi would pay for  making her leave her shrine.</p>
<p>Rei caught sight of  yet another poster and kicked a can that had the misfortune of being  thrown on the ground in front of her.</p>
<p>If she had never  left... if she didn't have to do this shopping...</p>
<p>Exhausted, she sat  on a bench, the sun now high in the sky, enshrouding her in its  light, though it wasn't particularly hot.</p>
<p>If she had stayed  home... at least she could have thought in peace. Maybe even done  some meditation.</p>
<p>She looked up. And  groaned.</p>
<p>Rei sat there,  staring at the sight before her, before eventually stepping up to the  plate, crossing the street to the other side.</p>
<p><em>'I feel like I've been cursed. If I  have, I give up. I'm fatally lovesick and if I don't get things off  my mind, I'll never be able to rest. Not with these thoughts.'</em></p>
<p>She stopped and  looked over at the sign propped beside the door. It read, 'Eika's  Afternoon Romance Counseling- FREE'</p>
<p>She opened the  door, distantly hearing the bell twinkle in announcement of her  presence.</p>
<p>The woman she'd  talked with this morning looked up and smiled at her. “Eika at your  service. Are you here for the counseling or the jewelry?”</p>
<p><em>'Kami-sama, if it is your doing that  guided me here, give me the strength to endure it, too.'</em></p>
<p>Rei cleared her  throat and stepped closer.</p>
<p>“Counseling, I suppose.”</p>
<p>UUU...nnn...UUU...nnn...UUU</p>
<p>Eika took a quiet sip from her coffee  mug, nodding in understanding as Rei paused in her- well, you  couldn't really call it anything else but a rant. She'd been holding  it in for a long time.</p>
<p>Rinka watched, leaning against the back  doorway, amazed at everything Rei had to say. It didn't take a genius  to figure out who she was talking about, no matter how much nearly  revealing the name had tripped the priestess up. Since she obviously  didn't want to let it be known who she was babbling about, Eika had  respected those wishes and only used 'this person' or 'him'  generically to refer to her customer's love.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate however, that Rinka  had to remind them of the time. Lunch hour would be over soon.</p>
<p>Eika glanced over at the woman as she  took a step forward. <em>'Wait a minute,' </em>her look commanded, <em>'I'll have things settled before we have other shoppers in here.'</em></p>
<p>Rinka obliged,  continuing to polish the broach in her hands.</p>
<p>As if on cue, Rei  was already winding down. “S- They'll be leaving again in a few  days if I don't do anything... I want to do something for them...  keep them from leaving if I possibly can... but... I... I don't...”  The priestess sighed, looking up. “I just don't know if I have what  it takes.”</p>
<p>Eika waited a  moment to see if she was really done. Then, she looked down at the  brightly lit glass case between them that she'd been using as a  coffee table.</p>
<p>“Hino-san... It's clear to me- and  I'm aware, to you as well- that you're very much in love with this  person. And I'll tell you this honestly; I've never heard such a  detailed story without hearing any mention of a name or a profession,  even if that's the problem. Ah- that's not a bad thing; I'm just  mentioning it.” Eika leaned forward, lacing her fingers together in  a steeple. “But, Hino-san, I am quite confident that you have more  than enough of 'what it takes' to make it work. Though it may take a  little initiative on your part. Are you willing to do that?” <em>Obviously</em>, Eika answered herself.</p>
<p>Rei nodded. Then  there was a pause, and Eika saw the look that she'd seen quite a few  times doing her hobby. The panic from talking so much about private  matters to a stranger.</p>
<p>Eika smiled. “As  I assured you when I began, nothing uttered here leaves the confines  of these walls without the permission of the speaker. Besides which,  it is simply no one else's business. Now then,” Eika straightened  in her seat. “Let me affirm a few things in particular. This person  is your friend as of currently. Do you want them to be more than that  in the future?”</p>
<p>Rei looked down,  inadvertently at the birthstone collection. “I... I don't know.  If... if it comes to that... I'll be... be... happy, I guess. But  right now, I just... want to find a way to keep them from leaving  again.” She spoke this in a whisper, but Eika heard every word.</p>
<p>“I see... If you were to confess, how  do you think this person would react?”</p>
<p>Rei froze. <em>'How </em>would <em>the Goddess of Love react?' </em>“Well... if... if I  think about it... I think they'd be... surprised... at first...  but... they have really good intuition about love so... I think they  would be able to... to... understand where it came from... at  least... but... but in the end...” Rei let out a long exhale. “I'll  probably be politely reje-”</p>
<p>“Wrong.”</p>
<p>Eika had declared  this with such dark conviction that it startled Rei into looking up.</p>
<p>Eika grinned  pleasantly at her again. “Self-destructive thoughts are bad for  people who are thinking of confessing, Hino-san. You should know more  than anyone else; it's much like praying to Kami-sama- Please help me  succeed on my test... even though I know without your help I'll  fail...” The grin widened. “We have a special order coming in  later this week that I think contains the perfect gift to your  special person, but of course, you'd have to wait for that. It might  be cutting it close, but I think we'd be able to make it. I'd show  you a picture but the catalog is... erm... it's been misplaced for a  bit.”</p>
<p>“How much does it cost?”</p>
<p>Eika considered it.  “How much was it...? Hmm... How much money do you have to spare?”</p>
<p>Rei froze.</p>
<p>Eika suddenly  realized how that might have sounded and she quickly denounced it.  “Ah, I don't intend to scam you of all your money or anything. Not  in the least. I was just asking because... well... can you pay  200,000 yen by the end of the week?”</p>
<p>Rei's eyes nearly  came out of her sockets.</p>
<p>Eika laughed. “I  thought as much. So how much <em>are </em>you willing to spend? I  promise it'll be worth your while.”</p>
<p>Rei looked down,  considering it.</p>
<p>Eika offhandedly  murmured, “I was of the mind to suggest these birthstones here;  they're all in the 20,000 yen range, but halfway through your  monologue, I realized these wouldn't cut it for the quality of your  love.”</p>
<p>Rei was silent.  Contemplating.</p>
<p>Eika went on.  “You're famous and you've done many good deeds for the sake of  charity and protecting in important times, but I understand you gave  most of the money you received for spontaneous rescuing to charity  organizations, so you don't have much now...”</p>
<p>Rei slowly clutched  and unclutched her fists. <em>'Can I do it?'</em></p>
<p>“I don't normally offer this, but if  you would be willing to affiliate with our company for the sake of  advertisement, I would be willing to stretch the payment time across  an equally long timeline. That is to say, you may pay whenever you  can in six months if your shrine endorses our store for six months.”</p>
<p>Rei looked up,  surprised. “Really?”</p>
<p>Eika nodded,  smiling. “Nothing fancy; your own recommendation would be quite  sufficient for us, via word of mouth. You're quite popular in this  area, if you hadn't noticed.”</p>
<p>Rei looked down again, fighting off a  blush. When she looked up again, she cleared her throat. “I was  just thinking... I still have about... 100,000 from the bit that I  saved, as you said, from protection award payments. I was considering  what I would do with it, since I intend to stay by my shrine, which  has quite a sound donation base with which to care for it, but... I'm  not sure if I want to spend it all towards one thing...” Rei smiled  wearily. “But I think I can do it. They aren't the type to be  bought by jewelry, but it'd be nice to get it for them, I think.  Something different. And if everything works out... they'd be able to  fund any cushioning I need to keep going should I be in need of  help.”</p>
<p>Eika paused. “Are you agreeing then?”</p>
<p>Rei smiled more firmly and stood up,  soon followed in suit by Eika. “I'd be glad to advertise for you  anyway, though the payment time extension will help me as well.”</p>
<p>Eika smiled back, outstretching her  hand. “A deal then?”</p>
<p>Rei nodded, meeting the offer to shake  the woman's hand. “I do hope that if this piece that I haven't seen  yet isn't what I like, I can pick something else?”</p>
<p>Eika grinned, not letting Rei's hand  go. “Of course. That reminds me however. If it isn't too much  trouble, might you come back, at this time, on... Wednesday and  Friday? Those are the only times that I'm officially free and at a  time that you might not necessarily be spending with your special  person. I'd... aside from showing you are current selection, there  are other things I'd like to discuss with you.”</p>
<p>Rei let her hand go slack and Eika  released her. “Discuss? Like what?”</p>
<p>Eika laughed. With a wink, Eika  replied, “Tips on how to woo a princess. Hino-chan, you've never  confessed to a girl before, right?”</p>
<p>In that moment, Rei made a very good  imitation of a statue.</p>
<p>Well, more like a person petrified by  aliens while trying to run in fear, but that's beside the point.</p>
<p>Rei gulped.</p>
