<p>Be  Careful What You Wish For</p>
<p>The cave had small piles of shattered rock in various  places, but was otherwise in fairly good shape considering the fact that six  bunker busters had impacted the castle on the cliff above. Not that Clove knew  what those were, but the devastation of her former home had made her fear her  workroom had been likewise destroyed.</p><p>
  But the flat central space was relatively untouched,  proof of the effectiveness of her warding spells. She waved a hand as a  snakelike shadow darted towards her, the minor spirit pausing as it recognized  her. Good, even with the new body, her essential essence was truly <em>hers</em>. She should have no problems with  what she planned.</p><p>
  The first thing on her list she prayed had survived as  well, or her plans would be for naught. The mere thought of returning to the  Valley of Cursed Springs made her blood turn to ice. The memory of seeing Xi’an  Chi’s mask through the water as he held her pinned to the bottom swam before  her eyes and she shuddered. The worst part was its lack of expression. No  anger, no hatred, just the smooth implacable porcelain of a beautiful  androgynous face that had twin slashes of red descending below it’s eyes like  the bloody fangs of a tiger. </p><p>
  She had to support herself against a rock pillar as  the memory robbed her legs of strength.</p><p>
  <em>Why didn’t you save me, Shi? Was Mu so  much more valuable to you that you couldn’t have spared a second to put an  arrow through his skull? Even if it didn’t slay him, it might have given me a  chance to escape…</em></p><p>
  She gritted her teeth against the sob, and forced  herself upright. <em>NO!</em> She wasn’t going  let them break her! So they had all betrayed her! She was whole again and her  revenge would be terrible!</p><p>
  She looked back at the still figure floating behind  her and grinned evilly. “You will pay for your lack of compassion, Shi. I could  not take Mu from you, but I will take her mirror. And when she finds you in  hell, I pray it will make you suffer like no other!”</p><p>
  She strode across the cave to a large iron chest, the  black metal only lightly touched with spots of rust, and ordered it to open.  Inside was a rack holding dozens of wax sealed glass bottles, each labeled in  precise ideograms. She hunted through them before anxiously reaching for one,  lifting it and sighing in relief to see it was still full.</p><p>
  She held it aloft to the comatose figure. “A present  for you, my pet. We shall correct the seeming error of your body and soul, and  then you shall be a perfect host for our little deception.” A maniacal laugh  issued from her lips. </p><p>
  There was no response from the beautiful feminine  form, but far away from the remains of the Musk Fortress, two girls on the way  to school shivered.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ukyo and Zhu Shu looked at each other as the shiver  ran down their spines.</p><p>
  “Eh, I hate it when that happens.” Ukyo muttered. </p><p>
  “Zhu Shu too. Hear that mean someone think bad at you.”</p><p>
  “Yeah. Just a superstition, sugar. So, you looking  forward to Nabiki’s opening tonight? Should be pretty busy.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Thought would wear practice dance  dress. One no see through.”</p><p>
  Ukyo grinned. “Yeah, we don’t want to start a riot. I  hear Nabiki’s planning on having Akane in a playboy bunny and plans to dress  Ranma up in dog ears. Should be called Club Hentai.”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu think draw many customers. Shan Pu even find  big bell charms for odango. Help sister sew dress to let tail through.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shook her head. “I hope Nabiki has plenty of  tissue stocked. I even called in one of the better cooks from dad’s restaurant  chain just in case it gets really swamped, or I want to take a break. I’m  thinking tonight might make up for the lost profits the last few days.”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu not worry. Not really have much use money  anyway. Give most to Kasumi for house to use.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “What, don’t you have like, a CD  collection or something?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Watch TV with Akane  sometimes, or read manga. Have friend Lum who had videos of anime, but Zhu Shu  no have player.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shook her head. “We’re going to have to correct  that, Sugar. Don’t you get bored?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “No. Have plenty time  meditate, or sometimes go out with girls to shop. Usually go school, teach  girls and work, before do homework and sleep.”</p><p>
  Ukyo gave her a disbelieving stare. “My god, girl,  you’ve got to be kidding me? I have a business to run and I still take time out  to go to the movies occasionally. Don’t you do anything for fun?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blushed. “Um… not really think should say.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked blankly for a minute, then nodded. “Oh….”  She did a doubletake. “OH!” before she blushed a bright red too. “That’s right,  you and Rei have been…” she rolled her eyes. “I <em>do</em> remember her mentioning that.”</p><p>
  “Ukyo is not upset that Zhu Shu and Rei have been  together?”</p><p>
  “Huh? Why would I care- oh yeah, right.” Ukyo  shrugged. “I hadn’t really thought about it. Things are weird enough as they  are. And I really don’t have the right to tell you not to see her or any thing.  I donno. The whole situation is still kinda brain bending with all this past  life stuff. Rei says she was once your wife, and I remember being your wife…  truthfully, it makes my brain hurt to think about all of it, so I try not to.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Zhu Shu try hard to deny she empress  too. No-one listen.”</p><p>
  “That’s because we know better, Zhu-chan.” Lo Shen  interjected from a few feet behind them. “And because those who still hunt the  Song will not take your desires into account, only your lineage.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.</p><p>
  “So who exactly is after Zhu-chan?  Besides this Clove girl.” Ukyo asked. “I’ve  gotten a few hints, but no really clear picture of what’s going on.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen looked at Zhu Shu with a raised eyebrow, and  the little dragon girl nodded.</p><p>
  “Alright, first, you mentioned you had a memory of  being married to Lin Tzu, so I know you are aware that a thousand years ago,  the world was much different than most people believe. The Earth was actually a  loose federation of kingdoms under the rule of Prince Endymion’s father, the  High King. Empress Song ruled the Empire of the Dragon, which encompassed modern  China, and the entire Indo-China area from Mongolia down to the Philippines,  including Japan. She became Empress after her father died and named her his  successor, because her older brother had proven himself an evil and corrupt ruler  during a test as governor of a province. Xi’an Chi never forgave Lin Tzu for  usurping what he saw as his divine right to rule.”</p><p>
  Ukyo snorted. “Well, at least I can rest knowing there  was no way he could have survived the wounds I gave him before he killed me.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen gave her a long look. “Unfortunately, Xi’an  Chi yet lives. He is a sorcerer, Ukyo. And he sold his soul to darkness. It was  he who turned Queen Beryl from the devoted servant of the Earth Kingdom to the  snake in the High King’s bosom by manipulating her into a trap and making her a  slave of the inhuman Metallia. When Lin Tzu won the heart of the Dragon, it  infuriated him. She became his obsession, and he crippled her ability to aid  Queen Serenity at a crucial time. When Beryl convinced the High King to begin  his assault on the Moon Kingdom, the forces of the Song Empire were mired in a  civil war with Xi’an Chi’s traitors. Lin Tzu was barely spirited out of the  Palace with her daughter before the palace was overrun. I fear we Amazons  managed to rescue only her two other wives who were with child. The other eight  sacrificed themselves to protect them as they fled.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shook her head. “I remember almost cutting him in  half. Damn.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu was looking at her in adoration, but Ukyo  failed to see the dragon girl’s shining eyes. </p><p>
  “Anyway,” Lo Shen continued. “Xi’an Chi vanished  before the Silencing, when Saturn destroyed and remade the world. From what you  say, it was no doubt due to the wounds he received at your hands. Until  recently, we were unaware he had survived. Unfortunately, we discovered that he  was behind more recent misfortunes for Clan Dragon. According to Zhu Shu’s  grandfather, he was behind the rift that started the war between Dragon and  Musk, turning a once noble clan into a pack of arrogant brigands and  scoundrels.” Lo Shen sighed. “I suppose we had our own share of the blame,  though. Clove was my rival under my master’s tutelage, and she was the daughter  of a black dragon, which made her arrogant and proud. I despised her, and Ke  Lun loved humiliating her.” She shrugged. “We were young and foolish. Perhaps  had we not treated her so poorly, she would not have turned out as she did. She  was much like your rival, Ai, Zhu Shu. I am glad to see you have not allowed  her rivalry to fester the way Ke Lun and I did.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged. “Ai have problems with self image.  She not so bad as she think is. Zhu Shu see small girl who cry inside. Ai like  hedgehog.”</p><p>
  Ukyo laughed while Lo Shen scratched her head.  “Hedgehog?” </p><p>
  “The hedgehog’s dilemma-” Ukyo said with a smile. “-is  that while it might wish to get close to someone, it can’t help that its spines  will cause hurt to whoever tries.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen blinked then nodded. “Ah, I see. Yes, Ai’s personal  tragedies have made her fearful of allowing herself to open her heart fully. In  hindsight, I learned to see that Clove was much the same way. As she grew  older, she grew more bitter, and selfish. She was utterly gorgeous, and had no  compunctions about using her beauty to seduce whoever took her fancy, but she  failed utterly with Shi. He only had eyes for Mu, and refused to marry Clove,  even when she tried to pressure him with an old engagement agreement that had  been stricken from the treaties then in force between their houses. Her father,  Garlic, thought it would be more to his advantage to keep his daughter  available for political alliance, and turned a blind eye to her lusts.”</p><p>
  “Lusts?” Ukyo asked.</p><p>
  “Clove was a bit of a nymphet. In the arts of  seduction, she had few equals and no superiors. Though she exercised her arts  mainly on women, she could inflame the passions of men just by walking through  the room, much like my niece here, but Clove always did so consciously. In  part, I fear, that was one thing I hated her for.” Lo Shen shrugged. “When I  first looked as I do now, I knew little about feminine artistry. I was a tomboy  always digging under rocks for their secrets and experimenting with our  master’s chemicals. I was sixteen and she almost twenty, and I broke my heart  over her beauty. She liked very feminine women, and I was, I have to admit,  what you call a geek these days. I took my disappointment out on her, and Ke  Lun saw her as a rival for Shi, before he meet and fell for Mu, and she married  Happosai.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu spun and looked at her wide eyed. “Great  Grandmother do what!?!”</p><p>
  Lo Shen cracked a smile. “Oh, yes. Happy was a  handsome man in those days, and a smooth talker, though even then he was an  utter letch.  Ke Lun’s always been quite  a lusty girl herself and he quite swept her off her feet, then took off on  their wedding day with the family heirlooms and quite a bit of the treasury.  Why do you think his sealing away was of such importance to us? We have had  blood feud against the demon master for nearly three hundred years, especially  since he left Ke Lun with child.”</p><p>
  “Who’s Happosai?” Ukyo interjected.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu snorted. “Him Master of Genma and Soun. Big  Hentai. Zhu Shu have to talk spirit to try find <em>Kaisufuu</em>. Him make her give panties to make tell he not know where  was.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen looked at her in alarm. “You did <em>what?</em> You did not mention this to us at  council, Little Mouse.”</p><p>
  The dragon girl blushed, her ears drooping. “Zhu Shu  too embarrassed.”</p><p>
  “I wish you had told us. I will have to go and check  the seals. He draws strength from such things.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked stricken. “Not know be so bad.”</p><p>
  “One pair of panties probably would not be enough to  enable him to break free, though it might be close. It is no matter. I will go  reinforce the seals tomorrow.”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu hope no cause disaster.”</p><p>
  “Hey, you heard her Zhu-chan. She said it was nothing  she couldn’t fix.” Ukyo looked at the worried dragon girl and tried to think of  something to distract her before she got morose. A bright idea hit and she dug  into a pocket, pulling out her iPod. “Anyway, back to the subject of fun. Here,  let’s see what you think of this.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu followed her instructions about the earbuds,  though they were a little trickier getting situated in Zhu Shu’s dragon ears,  but soon enough, she was dancing along to a catchy tune, a wide smile on her  face. “Zhu Shu see many with little boxes. Now understand why!” she shouted.</p><p>
  Ukyo laughed and turned the volume down. “You have to  be careful, sugar. You think you’re talking normally and don’t realize you’re  not.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Zhu Shu try remember. Can Ukyo show  where to get little box?”</p><p>
  Ukyo laughed. “Keep that one, I was planning on  getting a Nano anyway.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled happily and lifted Ukyo off the ground  in a twirling hug. “Thank you!”</p><p>
  “Easy, sugar!” Ukyo laughed. “I can’t fly like you.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu giggled as she set the chef back down. “Zhu  Shu like music. She hear before on show with big purple demon.”</p><p>
  “Purple demon?”</p><p>
  “Yes.  Purple  demon have boy ride in.  Fight angels.”</p><p>
  “Oh, Cruel Angel’s Thesis. You like Neon Genesis  Evangelion?” </p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Feel for poor white hair girl, Ayanami-san.  She so lonely.”</p><p>
  Ukyo grinned. “I like Asuka, she’s got a sassy  attitude.  I should have guessed you’d watched  Evangelion when you mentioned the hedgehog.” She motioned to the iPod. “I got a  ton of anime themes in there, and some American rock, and a bunch of odds and  ends, like meditational stuff.” She shrugged. “I like a weird mix.”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu like cute animals from shows. She have many  stuffies.”</p><p>
  Ukyo raised an eyebrow. “Somehow, I just don’t see you  going out and buying them.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blushed. “No. Hentai boys give.”</p><p>
  Ukyo laughed. “Before they found out you’re a lesbian,  I’ll bet.”</p><p>
  “No. Still give. Zhu Shu seem get more once school  find out.”</p><p>
  Ukyo broke out in giggles. “Sure, what am I thinking.  A lot of guys <em>like</em> lesbians.”</p><p>
  “Yes. Japan  not seem mind girl-girl like in China.  Zhu Shu have manga she given by Hentai boy about Melon and Non. Very funny and  no one seem mind they lovers.” She blushed. “But it also seem like instruction book  for girl-girl sex.”</p><p>
  Ukyo doubled over. “Oh gods, Zhu-chan. That has to the  funniest thing I’ve heard in years. Vanity Angel is a <em>boy’s</em> sex comic!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked. “No understand.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blushed. “Umm. It’s a masturbation manga… for  boys.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked, then turned nearly as crimson as her  cheongsam as Lo Shen broke out in a roar of laughter.</p><p>
  “You’ll have to pardon my niece, Ukyo. She’s had  little experience with such things.”</p><p>
  Ukyo grinned. “No problem. I think it’s cute,  actually. I’ve got a collection of shojo ai and yuri manga at home that I’ve  been given by girls who’ve chased me myself.”</p><p>
  “Maybe Ukyo could help Zhu Shu with learn Kanji. She  not very good reading yet.” the dragon girl said with a sidelong look.</p><p>
  Ukyo rolled her eyes. “Maybe. I’ll think about it.”  She nodded to the iPod. “I’ll show you how to work that with the computer too,  and we’ll fill it up with songs you like.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded enthusiastically as Lo Shen smiled  indulgently behind the pair. It was nice to see Zhu Shu happy.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Of course, the iPod ended up getting Zhu Shu sent to  the hall when she failed to hear the teacher calling her name for attendance,  but the little dragon girl didn’t mind. She was flittering halfway to the roof  as she danced in mid-air, not realizing she was dripping water everywhere when  the bell rang for the next class.</p><p>
  “Hey!” Nabiki had to poke Zhu Shu’s hip to get the  dragon girl’s attention over the music. “Put that away! You’re gonna be late  again if you don’t pay attention.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu reluctantly pulled the earbuds out. “Ukyo give  as gift.”</p><p>
  Nabiki wrung the water out of her ears. “That’s great…  but you can’t listen to it in school.”</p><p>
  The dragon girl pouted, but tucked it behind her back.  “It like nothing Zhu Shu own before. Such small box make so many songs.”</p><p>
  “Zhu-chan, honey. We could have gotten you one  anytime. You’ve still got a small fortune setting in the bank after we sold  your gold coins, and as soon as I get a buyer for a few of those oban you  brought home, we’re <em>all</em> going to be  doing pretty well. You could pretty much get whatever you want.” She looked  around. “Hell, I’m really only still selling pics to keep up my contacts.  Between Mr. Tsukino paying for the girls training, a couple of deals I’ve made  online with the stocks, and now the share of the Musk treasure you gave us, I  should have the mortgage paid off completely in a month, and be able to start  paying Sandal to do some real renovations. Money really isn’t much of a problem  right now.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged. “Not know of anything need. Zhu Shu  have everything necessary.”</p><p>
  Nabiki blinked. “Zhu Shu, honey, we have got to  educate you in the realities of modern life. You can never have too many toys.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu giggled as Nabiki pulled on her shoulder to  set her feet on the ground.  Nabiki  looked around again as Zhu Shu went to grab her book bag, and she noted Ai a  few yards away, looking at the dragon girl with an odd look on her face.  As soon as the cheerleader saw Nabiki looking  at her, she hurriedly turned away.   Nabiki’s eyebrow raised.  If she  didn’t know better, she’d have almost said Ai looked sad.</p><p>
  Then Zhu Shu was back, and she tucked a note in the  back of her mind to think about it later, and headed for their next class.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>The rest of the day passed uneventfully, but the halls  were filled with a buzz of conversation about the imminent opening of Club  Nabiki, aided no doubt by the flyers Nabiki had had posted everywhere. Then  again, she’d also released a whole slew of photos of all four of the waitresses  in their various outfits. </p><p>
  The preparations went pretty smoothly as well, other  than convincing Ranma to done her puppy eared hairband and wear the cute little  sailor outfit with the puppy tail Nabiki had gotten her. Of course, there <em>was</em> curiosity as to exactly what Akane  had whispered in the red-head’s ear to make her go from protesting to  enthusiastic. Even Soun and Genma dressed in their rented tuxedos with very  little protest, while Nodoka and Kasumi were wearing very pretty formal kimonos  with geta, Nodoka’s obi in a delicate shade of sky blue while Kasumi’s was a  rosy pink.</p><p>
  Nabiki had chosen to go in a midnight black evening  gown, cut to dip below her tail, but with a large black bow tied just above the  fluffy appendage to keep it from being too immodest. She was the owner after  all, it wouldn’t do to be mistaken as one of the waitresses.</p><p>
  Shan Pu had added two oversized cat’s bells to her  usual ball chimes, affixing them in the place of her normal odango behind her  cat’s ears, and she had even added two small bells to her collar and tag. The  short cheongsam she had chosen was a deep midnight blue silk, with small  embroidered bells in gold thread along the seams. She’d finished the outfit  with a bell tied to the end of her tail.</p><p>
  Then there was Akane, wearing the fishnet stockings  and body suit of a Playboy bunny, who was, surprisingly, looking forward to  strutting around all night in the sexy outfit. She was putting everything she  had learned from the link with Zhu Shu to use, and it showed. Even Ranma  whistled as she came down the stairs.</p><p>
  For once, Tao-Ching showed up on time, probably due  more to the chauffer than anything he was responsible for. The buff twenty year  old looked very dashing in his tux as well, making Nabiki smile as he escorted  her to the limo.</p><p>
  The Club already had a short line of people waiting as  they arrived at the entrance, the two huge bouncers in muscle shirts and jeans  giving the girls waiting with their dates their own eyecandy, while the boys  were drooling in anticipation of what would await inside. Nabiki nodded. Once  word got around that the club had beefcake as well as cheesecake, she had no  doubt business would keep booming. </p><p>
  The inside had been done up in a tasteful style, reminiscent  of the House of Blue Leaves from the American movie Kill Bill, but she had  settled for a DJ instead of a band, and the lighting was far more subdued,  having spots over the various tables rather than using the overheads. She’d set  aside the upper level balcony for VIPs with a small catered bar solely for the  adults, with men at both stairs to make sure the teens didn’t try to sneak up  in hopes of getting alcohol.</p><p>
  She got the girls set up pretty quickly, handing out  checks and pens, then assigning tables and going over the menu choices. Zhu Shu  fluttered over to help Ukyo check out the kitchen while Nabiki was briefing the  others, and smiled happily when Ukyo said she planned on letting her helper  start out while she supervised and helped the girls get the hang of  waitressing. </p><p>
  Just before the doors were opened, Tao-Ching got a  phone call, and announced that a special event would take place in a couple of  hours or so. His investigators had unearthed the last survivor of the Hasai  family, the true owners of the first sword he had to return. He asked Zhu Shu  if she would bear witness for Lo Shen that he was trying to fulfill his vow  when he arrived, and got an enthusiastic nod.</p><p>
  Then the doors opened, and the rush began.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Things were going very smoothly when Urd and her  sisters arrived at the club. She and Mara had spent the day shopping and found  a matching set of evening gowns. Both were black silk, with plunging necklines  and were backless, but the billowy skirts with high slashed hips accented their  legs beautifully. Except for the side on which the slash occurred, and their  hair color, they could have been twins.</p><p>
  Belldandy had chosen a much more subdued off the  shoulder dress in a delicate saffron, the large ruffle across her breasts and  the fluffy skirt vaguely reminiscent of a southern belle from America’s old  south, the huge yellow silk bow at her back accenting the smaller bows in her  hair. Keiichi was also resplendent in his tux, the crisp bow tie courtesy of  Bell’s clever fingers.</p><p>
  Skuld had elected to go with pink, and ribbons. Lots  of ribbons. Her main dress would have been at home in a Shirley Temple movie or  magic girl anime, but the ribbons wrapped around her upper torso made it  something that verged on sexy when taken in combination with the ribbons  wrapped around her arms and lower legs, and the small bows on her slippers.</p><p>
  Shan Pu spotted them almost the moment they arrived  and bounced over to give the white haired goddess a hug. “Shan Pu want thank  for her wish, nyah!”</p><p>
  Urd smiled at the enthusiastic catgirl. “I’m not the  only one you should thank, dear. I wouldn’t have been able to work it out so  smoothly without the help of your Blood-sister and Ke Lun. And it’s not quite  done yet.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu blinked. “No?”</p><p>
  Urd shook her head. “No. You specified everybody  concerned. I still have quite a bit to do to tie up all the loose ends.”</p><p>
  “Myah! Shan Pu not know she make such complicated  wish.”</p><p>
  Just then, Zhu Shu fluttered up. “Sister who is-” She  broke off, staring at Mara.</p><p>
  Her swords were out in a flash and she flitted in  front of Shan Pu. “You no hurt Sister, Demon!”</p><p>
  Mara held up her hands. “Hey, whoa! I’m not a demon  anymore!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked. “But you demon come Zhu Shu and give  note where find Ranma!”</p><p>
  Mara nodded. “Yes, and I’m really sorry my imp got you  killed. I really wasn’t myself!” She pointed to her goddess marks. “Look,  Legend claimed me for killing you. He broke the spells I was under!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu’s swords dropped to the floor in shock as her  feet touched the ground. “You- you send monster?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu blinked and started to glow at the same time.  “You one kill sister!?!” </p><p>
  Urd stepped in front of the ex-demoness. “Girls,  please. She’s not the same person she was then. The Dragon removed her from my  mothers influence. She’s not a demon any more, really. Legend forgave her…”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu was blinking at Urd now. “You? You storyteller  send Zhu Shu Jusenkyo!”</p><p>
  Urd blinked. “I did?” then she remembered Legend’s  words, “Oh yeah. I did. I sent you there to meet Ranma, so that you could end  up here now.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu was looking back and forth between her sister  and the still fearful Mara. “Shan Pu kill?”</p><p>
  “Please Shan Pu.” Belldandy interjected. “Mara’s  really changed. And she was our friend long before she had to be our enemy. I  know she’s done some terrible things, but she really wasn’t responsible for her  actions. She was being manipulated.”</p><p>
  The diminutive Chinese girl nodded and waved the  catgirl down “Is okay, Shan Pu. Zhu Shu must trust Dragon. See now much that  was unclear before. Kasumi say she wonder if goddess make Zhu Shu and Akane  merge chi. Dragon must have reason.”</p><p>
  Belldandy colored prettily. “Well, actually that was  me. I was trying to help Urd, and I had planned to remove the portion on you  after I had talked to Ranma and he told me how upset he was about it. But I  never got the chance before Legend modified it himself after… um…”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head and had to laugh. “Is okay. Zhu  Shu owe much to Goddess for link.” She turned to the blonde goddess. “And Zhu  Shu forgive for death. Not wish to make goddess who grant Shan Pu wish lose one  who hold her heart.”</p><p>
  Mara sighed in relief, then blinked. “Wow. Urd told me  you were good at reading auras.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Zhu Shu no see anything  around goddesses. Aura and self are same. She see how Urd feel when she step in  front of to protect.”</p><p>
  Urd blushed. </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>With the potential hostilities defused, Shan Pu  quickly warmed up to Mara, and led the group up to the balcony to mingle. Urd  hunted down Ke Lun in short order and after a conference in the bathroom, the  bunny eared elder agreed to help with another small part of the wish.</p><p>
  Doctor Tofu couldn’t remember the last time he had  worn a tux, and he tugged at the stiff collar, wishing he didn’t feel like a  fool. At least he wasn’t the only adult, and Nabiki’s limitation on black ties  and gowns for the opening night had ensured that the teens who had come were  well behaved. Of course, that might also have had to do with her inviting their  parents as well, so they could assure themselves that the club was a good place  for their children to hang out at. The bouncers were very competent and  isolated the more rambunctious boys in the arcade, and even though the  waitresses were provocatively dressed, they kept enough covered that only a few  of the mothers raised an eyebrow. </p><p>
  Ke Lun sauntered up to him holding two tall glasses of  a pale amber liquid. “Hello Tofu. I brought you some apple juice, since I  didn’t think you would care for anything from the bar.”</p><p>
  He gave her a small bow. “Thank you, elder. That was  very thoughtful of you.” He took a sip, licking his lips at the faint  aftertastes of spices that lingered. “Very good.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun smiled. “A special blend brewed up by a friend  for tonight, for those of us who prefer not to lose our wits.”</p><p>
  He took another sip. “I must get the recipe from you  someday. It is very tasty.”</p><p>
  “So what brings you here tonight?”</p><p>
  Tofu smiled. “Miss Kasumi invited me, though I haven’t  seen her yet.”</p><p>
  “Ah yes. My great-granddaughter mentioned you have  some affection for the eldest Tendo girl.”</p><p>
  Tofu laughed. “I suppose, if you can call being  utterly incapable of forming a coherent thought around her ‘affection’.” He  shook his head ruefully. “I would give my soul to tell her I love her, but I  fear she thinks of me as little more than a fool.” He drained his glass.</p><p>
  “Have you ever told her of this?”</p><p>
  Tofu sighed. “I have tried, but every time I see her  face, I just can’t seem to find words to express how much joy her mere presence  makes me feel. I just get tongue tied, and my brain refuses to work.”</p><p>
  “Yes. I can remember feeling that way in my youth.”  She gave him a sidelong glance, holding up a finger behind him where he  couldn’t see. “So, if you <em>could</em> manage to overcome your nervousness, what do you think you would say to her?”</p><p>
  Tofu stared off into space with a sad smile. “I would  tell her how I have always loved her, ever since I met her. I would tell her  how special her smile is, and how I spend every minute listening for the sound  of her voice. I would tell her how much I admire her courage, and the strength  she has shown in taking care of her family. I would tell her of how I spend  every day wishing I could ask her to spend our lives together, of how much I  desire to be for her what she has been for others.” He smiled and took a small  box out of his pocket. “And most of all, I would ask her if she would consent  to be my wife.” He opened the box to reveal a simple silver ring set with a  small, but perfectly cut diamond. He gazed at it for a long moment before  chuckling ruefully.</p><p>
  And then, a delicate feminine hand reached from behind  his shoulder and caressed his hand as the most beautiful voice in the world  whispered softly in his ear.</p><p>
  “And she would tell you that she has been waiting for  you to ask for far too long, and that she will say ‘yes, with all her heart’.”</p><p>
  He turned in surprise, to see Kasumi standing behind  him.</p><p>
  But for once, even though his heart hammered and his  glasses got steamy around the edges, the fear and nervousness were absent.</p><p>
  The faint traces of herbs lingered on his tongue, and  he finally realized what Ke Lun had used. She’d hidden it under the apple juice  and cinnamon, but it was a simple calmative he had prescribed hundreds of times  for anxiety.</p><p>
  Amazing that he had never once thought to use it on  himself.</p><p>
  A bubble of silence formed around them as he knelt and  held out the ring. “Then I shall ask in truth. Will you be my wife, Kasumi?” </p><p>
  The look of joy in Kasumi’s eyes as he slid the ring  on her finger answered his question even as she shouted “Yes!”</p><p>
  She pulled him to his feet with surprising strength  and wrapped her arms around his neck as she whispered, “with all my heart.”</p><p>
  Then she kissed him, and the world went away…</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Urd smiled as she leaned over the balcony, observing  the show on the far side of the club. “I have been waiting for an opportunity  to do that for weeks.”</p><p>
  Mara hung over her shoulder and smiled. “They  certainly look happy enough.”</p><p>
  “I hope he gets the hint. I left enough flavoring to  the potion to make him think it’s one of his herbal remedies, and now that he’s  gotten past the fear once, I think he’ll have a much easier time from now on.”</p><p>
  Mara nodded. “Looks like for once your potion worked  perfectly.”</p><p>
  Urd rolled her eyes. “Gee, thanks.”</p><p>
  “Hey, you didn’t almost get eaten by one of your  potions gone wrong.” Mara giggled. “So what else is on the agenda?”</p><p>
  “Nothing tonight. Yggdrasil just said this was the  best chance to finally get Tofu and Kasumi together. Kasumi has been doing a  lot of thinking lately since her sisters have gotten engaged, and she’s had her  own crush on the doctor for years. She’d almost given up hope on him overcoming  his anxiety attacks though. That’s why I had to mix up that triple strength  dose. He’s going to be as calm as a rock for at least the next twenty four  hours. And if she does what I think she’ll do, the good doctor will be her  devoted worshipper by morning, with nothing left to doubt as to whether Kasumi  loves him or not. The Tendos might be doing without her for a few days.”</p><p>
  Mara giggled. “Sound like he’s going to be one lucky  man.” She nodded down at the dance floor. “So now that work’s over with, shall  we dance?”</p><p>
  Urd smiled, knowing Mara’s weakness for rock music.  “Absolutely.”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Urd and Mara weren’t the only ones watching the  surprise engagement. Even Ranma let out a cheer as the new couple kissed. And  the DJ wasted no time finding a slow song as he called them down the dance  floor. </p><p>
  Fortunately, Tofu danced divinely. </p><p>
  Midway thorough the dance, the Kuno’s finally arrived,  Tatewaki looking dashing in a traditional samurai outfit fit for an appearance  at court, and Kodachi in a black crush velvet evening gown that had her  trademark rose design shaved into the plush. Though she entered on Tatewaki’s  arm, she soon found a shadowy corner to alight in and sulk. Her eyes followed  Akane in despair, but she made no effort to attract her attention. It was  obvious she had only come because Tatewaki had brought her.</p><p>
  However, her arrival did prompt Usagi and Ami to take  Makoto into the arcade and get her playing video games before the tall girl  could henshin in front of everybody and blast the gymnast. </p><p>
  Tatewaki himself had nodded approvingly at the club  and joined Tao-Ching at the bar to chat, though he seemed quite distracted  watching the various girls moving around the club as well. He seemed to be  behaving himself though, even accepting politely when Kyoko asked him to dance  and not making a single attempt to glomp anyone. He seemed to be muttering  something under his breath like a litany the entire time he was on the floor,  and was as stiff and tense as anyone had ever seen him. </p><p>
  Ai and the other cheerleaders were there as well, with  various boys they had made pay for their evening, but the boys didn’t seem to  mind too much. They were too busy ogling the waitresses to notice their “dates”  spent more time gossiping among themselves then talking to them. Only Ayeka  seemed to not be having fun, her dark eyes shifting between scowling at where  Ai was begging Mina for an autograph and glowering at Zhu Shu.</p><p>
  Even Hiroshi and Daisuke had shown up, with Sayuri and  Yuka as their dates. </p><p>
  Up on the balcony, Nabiki looked out over the crowd  and smiled. It looked like the night was going to be a smashing success.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Far to the west of Nerima, thunder rumbled over the  ruins of the Musk fortress.</p><p>
  The underground workroom had changed dramatically over  the last twelve hours, the rock falls having vanished and the walls now covered  with glowing arcane script. In the center of the cave, an octagonal hexagram  burned with an inner light, the pale red glow illuminating the body hovering in  the center starkly.</p><p>
  Clove finished the last stroke of her brush with a  flourish, smiling as the ink sank into Konatsu’s skin. The black ink seemed to  soak in the light, looking almost like bottomless abysses in the kunoichi’s  body, yet paradoxally it also possessed a form of inner luminosity that made  looking at them difficult. Clove’s smile grew wicked.</p><p>
  “I made this spell just for you, Shi. But father moved  before I was ready, before I could arrange to capture Mu, and he forced me to  kill him and made this pointless.” She laughed as she gestured and the still  figure shifted to float upright. “It would have been her this spell was cast  upon, and you would have never known that when you made love to her, you would  have been loving <em>me</em>.”</p><p>
  She looked over the figure before her critically and  smiled. The results of her little correction had been satisfying. She ran her  fingers over the smooth skin of the girl before her, admiring the pleasant  weight of her full breasts in her cupped palm, the finely sculpted cleft  between her legs. Konatsu’s body was a work of art that easily matched her  heartbreakingly beautiful face, marred at the moment only by the various  ideograms and symbols Clove had painstakingly brushed over her entire body. </p><p>
  She stepped back from the silent figure to a spot she  had painted within the hexagram. Only one last part of the spell to go.</p><p>
  A wind sprang up in the cave as she began the final  words of the incantation. It swirled around the room, making the glowing  symbols on the wall flicker like candle flames before finally seeming to blow  them out one by one until only the hexagram still burned. Strange echoes  reverberated from her words as the hexagram grew brighter and brighter and the  ink on Konatsu’s body ignited into blue fire. The light grew brighter still,  soon obscuring both figures within the hexagram as Clove’s voice reached a  crescendo and the thunder shook the earth…</p><p>
  And then, the overwhelming brilliance died to reveal a  solitary figure within the hexagram.</p><p>
  And as the light faded to just that provided by the  single lamp still burning, Konatsu opened her eyes…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Tao-Ching waved to Kasumi and Tofu as they closed the  limo door and left for the dinner at Tokyo’s  best steakhouse that he had arranged to help the newly engaged pair celebrate  their evening with, and leaned against the door frame.</p><p>
  “I’ve been waiting for that to occur for almost four  years now.” Nabiki said dryly from next to him. “I have a feeling the good  doctor might not be able to walk in the morning. Kasumi’s got a lot of built up  desire and I already know what kind of energy she has in bed. Tofu’s gonna have  one hell of a night.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching grinned. “So much the better. Nice to have  such a good omen on your opening night.”</p><p>
  “Yep.” She raised her eyebrow as another limo pulled  in. “I wonder who that is? Everybody I invited is here.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching grinned. “I think <em>MY </em>guest has finally arrived.”</p><p>
  Indeed it was, the chauffer getting out to open the  door for a very pretty nurse who helped an elderly Japanese gentleman out of  the vehicle. Nabiki found herself admiring her curves and her unusual haircut,  the short bob cut mixed with the long pony tail seeming to suit the woman very  well, as did the diamond shaped tattoos on her cheeks and forehead. Tao-Ching  noticed her gaze and grinned. </p><p>
  “Nice to see we have the same taste in women.”</p><p>
  Nabiki elbowed him in the ribs before she stepped up  to the elderly gentleman and welcomed him to the club. </p><p>
  Taking his age into consideration, she had Tao-Ching  escort him to her office while she rounded up Zhu Shu, collecting Rei and Ukyo  in the process. They arrived in the office to find Kuno had invited himself as  well, and was busy attempting to impress the nurse with his flowery prose and descriptions  of his prowess. The Nurse seemed to be amused more than angry, so Nabiki  ignored him.</p><p>
  Tao-Ching waited till Nabiki had closed the office  door, shutting out the noise from the dance floor before he knelt in front of  the old gentleman he had settled into Nabiki’s chair. </p><p>
  “Mr. Hasai, I thank you for coming on such short  notice, and I hope that you will find my reason worth having you brought from  your home.”</p><p>
  The elder waved him down. “Never mind the bother. Any  chance to get out of the nursing home is welcome, young man. It’s not everyday  I get to ride in a limo with such a pretty young girl either.”</p><p>
  The nurse moved up to his side and smiled down at him.  “It was my pleasure, Mr. Hasai. I found your stories of your family history  very entertaining.”</p><p>
  The old man laughed. “I only wish it had a better  ending.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching grinned. “Then I hope that possibly what I  have for you will let you have that, Sir.” He picked up the cloth wrapped  bundle from the desk. “A short time ago, my associates and I acquired a large  number of historical artifacts, and among them, we recovered this…”</p><p>
  He untied the cord and slowly drew the silk bag down  to reveal the crest engraved on the scabbard just under the guard. </p><p>
  For a long moment, there was no sound except breathing  as the old man stared at the sword. Then he looked to the hopeful expression on  Tao-Ching’s face, the smile on Nabiki’s, even to where Zhu Shu gripped Rei’s  hand and Ukyo leaned forward expectantly. Even Kuno seemed to be holding his  breath in anticipation.</p><p>
  Then slowly, he reached out his hand and accepted the  sword reverently. His fingers traced down the silk wrapping, along the carved  tsuba, and finally stopped touching the crest.</p><p>
  He looked up at Tao-Ching, tears bright in his eyes.  “Son, this is a gift I could never have dreamed of. My family’s sword was  stolen from us nearly three hundred years ago, and we have suffered nothing but  misfortune since. I can never thank you enough for its return.” He hugged the  blade to him and sighed. “I only wish you could have returned it when it might  have truly saved us.”</p><p>
  There was a hush, broken only by the whisper from the  nurse of “Gotcha, Urd.”</p><p>
  Then a wind began in the room as the diamonds on  Peorth’s face began to glow, and her nurse’s outfit shredded to reveal her leather  harness and black bikini. Everyone blinked as she lifted off the floor into the  air, the diamonds growing brighter and brighter as small objects began to swirl  around the room.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked as she felt static electricity tingle  across her skin, and realized she had felt a vortex like this before. She tried  to shut off her channels and block out the flows, but she was helpless as a  crystalline energy seemed to fill her and threatened to wash her away in a  flood of raw power. She felt Rei’s hand in hers as she dimly heard Nabiki  scream “What’s happening!?!”</p><p>
  Then a pulse of argent power sprang from Peorth’s  forehead to pierce the ceiling and the room seemed to fade and dissolve in the  brilliant light.</p><p>
  And then, the light faded as Peorth slowly settled to  the ground and looked around the empty office.</p><p>
  She smiled. “Your wish has been approved.”</p><p>
  And then a wave of impossible force exploded through  the room and hurled her against the wall…</p>
