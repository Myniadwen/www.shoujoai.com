<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Minako&#39;s POV, outside cemetery

&quot;Yes, you heard correctly...Why? Well...something&#39;s come up. Mhmm... 
mhmm...&quot; I quickly glanced over to Rei. She was standing up ahead in 
front of her grandpa&#39;s grave. The service hadn&#39;t been too long ago. Only 
a few people actually came.

Poor Rei... Clearing all of our engagements can&#39;t make up for what&#39;s 
happened but it&#39;s the best I can do right now.

&quot;You do realize this could hurt you&#39;re popularity...&quot; The company 
representative at the other end said with worry.

&quot;Popularity isn&#39;t the only thing that matters,&quot; I said sternly. &quot;Listen, 
we&#39;ll think up of some gimmick later that&#39;ll grab our audience again 
&#39;kay? Don&#39;t worry so much.&quot;

&quot;B-but-&quot;

Click.

How annoying... Can&#39;t they get it through their heads that money isn&#39;t 
everything?

For a few minutes I stared at the small cell phone clenched tightly in 
my right hand. I never realized how hard I was squeezing it until now. 
Maybe it was because...for once, I didn&#39;t know what to do. I never felt 
like this since I first met all the others...being a leader, one must 
always be prepared. Or at least, that&#39;s what I told myself. It&#39;s not 
something you can pretend or run blindly through and hope it&#39;ll all turn 
out. That&#39;s how you put yourself and others into dangerous situations. 
That&#39;s how you get killed.

Just like now.

Should I go over there and see how she&#39;s doing? Or should I stay here 
and watch over her until she&#39;s ready to go? Attack or retreat, go over 
or to stay put? Why is everything so hard?

&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid...&quot; I shook my head. The answer should have been plain 
obvious from the start. &quot;I should go see her. Even if...she wants to be 
alone, she has to know that I&#39;m around if she needs me.&quot;

Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.

Tup, tup, tup, tup...

Cautiously I made my way over to where the raven-haired woman stood. She 
didn&#39;t move or made any indication that she noticed my approaching 
presence. As I took a step closer and then another, I could feel the 
tension increase enormously. It was hard to describe. I know I&#39;m not a 
psychic like Rei is, but I didn&#39;t need to be in this situation. Anyone 
would be able to feel that something was wrong.

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; I called out her name and then hesitantly placed my hand on 
her right shoulder.

Rei flinched and then shrugged her shoulder and pulled away. 
&quot;Mina-chan?&quot; She asked as she turned around.

I ignored the stinging feeling of being pushed away and forced myself to 
smile. &quot;Oh, you guessed right. Good job Rei-chan! It&#39;s just little o&#39;l 
me like you said.&quot;

I almost had done my &#39;V&#39; for victory pose but I quickly repressed the 
reflex. It&#39;s not like Rei would get the joke now. Knowing her the way 
she is now, she might ask why I was doing such a goofy stance.

Because...

Rei doesn&#39;t remember anything about being the senshi of fire. When I 
think about it, she can go on living a normal life this way. Would she 
be happier? Should Usagi and myself ever bother trying to get Mar&#39;s soul 
back to Rei? What if it only causes Rei more pain?

&quot;They said...he died from a heart attack.&quot; Rei mumbled and then looked 
at the grave again.

But it was a lie... It pained me to remember what really happen to her 
grandpa. What that sick demon did...was unforgivable. If I had the power 
I would have made it pay. If I had the power...

I could have prevented this...

&quot;You&#39;re angry. Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Mm?&quot; I looked up and gave Rei a confused look. &quot;Are you reading minds 
again?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t need to. It&#39;s written all over your face, especially in your 
eyes.&quot; She pointed out.

&quot;Ah...&quot; So that&#39;s it. &quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Really... Oh... I almost forgot, I&#39;ve cancelled all of our bookings for 
awhile.&quot;

&quot;What? But why?&quot; She demanded.

&quot;Rei...&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t because of... of this is it? I&#39;m still the same person. It&#39;s 
not like I&#39;m any weaker. Don&#39;t you have any faith in me?&quot; The woman 
frowned.

Her words left me speechless for a moment. You are different...you just 
don&#39;t realize it yet.

&quot;It&#39;s the exact opposite,&quot; I lifted my arms and gripped her shoulders. 
&quot;Look Rei, I know you&#39;re a strong person. You always were...and still 
are. For your information, I have complete faith in you...it&#39;s 
just...there&#39;s always a time for a break. The music business can go on 
hold for now, there&#39;s no need to rush.&quot; The statement of what I said hit 
me. I wonder if losing Mar&#39;s soul will affect her life span? Growing up 
without Rei? It&#39;s... it&#39;s... &quot;Ahaha, besides, weren&#39;t you going to fix 
up the shrine? That would take some time. We should get that out of the 
way first, don&#39;t ya think?&quot;

&quot;I guess...Mm...&quot; She coughed. &quot;&#39;We?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think that I&#39;m going to let you do it alone,&quot; I grinned. 
&quot;So...are we done here or do you want to stay a little bit longer?&quot;

Rei shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m done with saying good-byes.&quot; She looked up at 
me with tears beginning to form in her amethyst eyes, both of them 
swirling with emotions. And then...it was gone. I saw the miko will 
herself to steel them for her sake and perhaps my own. That was the sort 
of person she was.

Yet what she said struck me as odd. I&#39;m done with saying good-byes?

Silently I took her hand in mine and lead her away from the depressing 
place. Getting away from it was what we both needed, I think.

Hikawa Shrine

I was now in Rei&#39;s old room, watching myself in the mirror. Following 
Rei&#39;s advice, I changed clothing into a priestess outfit that was 
identical to Rei&#39;s own. My hands were busying themselves with pulling my 
long hair up into a ponytail. Having hair this long was only a 
disadvantage when opportunity presented itself...which was often. Taking 
care of it, cleaning- washing and drying...there was just so much of it!

&quot;There we go.&quot; I sighed as I finished tying it up and then let my hands 
drop to my sides. &quot;Finally...humph, I wouldn&#39;t bet Rei planned all this 
so she could finish everything herself before I even finished changing. 
Well, whatever. I guess I should go find her.&quot;

Tup, tup, tup...

One left hand turn, two right hand turns and then going straight...I 
didn&#39;t find the other woman until I came upon a small room at the other 
end of the grounds.

&quot;Rei-chan, I&#39;m ready. Hm? Rei, what&#39;re you doing?&quot; I blinked as the miko 
was moving objects around at the other end of the spacious room. The 
place was surprisingly dark, prompting me to wonder, what the heck did 
they do with the lights?

&quot;Hey Mina, I was just moving some of grandpa&#39;s old things into some 
boxes. Since...well, you know, they aren&#39;t going to be used for awhile.&quot;

&quot;...I see. Do you need some help with that?&quot;

Without turning around Rei motioned me over with a hand wave. Guess that 
means &#39;yes&#39;.

&quot;The already packed boxes should go in the storage room in the back. 
Think you can handle it? Just put them on the shelves.&quot; She instructed.

&quot;Okay-Oof.&quot; Gosh, they&#39;re pretty heavy. Resisting the urge to make grunt 
noises I lugged one box at a time over to where Rei had told me. &quot;Leave. 
It. To. Me.&quot; I said a word with each step.

&quot;If it&#39;s too heavy I can help,&quot; Rei casually offered. I could feel her 
eyes on my back as she said this, making me feel indignant. It&#39;s not 
like I need to be watched like some child!

&quot;Huh? No way! I&#39;m good.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; She shot me a sarcastic look with a raised eyebrow.

Looking at what she was looking at, I looked down and noticed how badly 
my arms were shaking. Damn, it looks like my body is doing more and more 
things on its own without my permission. I felt my face burn with hurt 
pride.

&quot;Yes, REALLY. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot; I said sweetly... too soon. As I 
turned to go my feet tripped over each other. &quot;Yipes!&quot;

TUP!

Clatter!

I didn&#39;t fall? I was pretty sure when you fell, you hit a hard floor and 
hear a thud.

&quot;Eh?&quot; I opened one of my eyes and then both of them to see that Rei had 
caught me. It felt a lot like our dance pose during our first concert. 
What about the box? &quot;Oh no! I hope nothing broke!&quot; I lunged up, only to 
fall back to the ground to frantically examine the items that had 
spilled out.

&quot;Slow down... don&#39;t worry about it so much,&quot; Rei grasped my hand.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand, they&#39;re important to you aren&#39;t they? It&#39;s all you 
have left of...&quot;

Rei opened her mouth but then closed it again. She did it once more, 
making me seriously curious as to what she wanted to say. And...Was she 
staring?

&quot;Just...don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; She finally repeated.

The woman then bent down beside me and carefully began to pick up the 
items that had fallen out. To me if felt like she was picking up the 
pieces of her heart, whether she knew what really happened to her 
grandpa or not. A loss was a loss. I couldn&#39;t help but feel the strong 
sadness grip me deep inside.

When Rei reached out for an object between us, my hand had already beat 
hers to it.

&quot;If I hadn&#39;t stumbled...Let me help, okay?&quot;

&quot;You tripped,&quot; She pointed out before taking the object my hand and then 
sighed. &quot;Jeez, it&#39;s almost like you and Usagi really do share 
everything.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? I was only trying to be nice.&quot; I crossed 
my arms in false indignation.

&quot;Mm...speaking of which, where is Odango? I haven&#39;t seen her since last 
night after she crashed over here. Did you see her leave?&quot;

Since all three of us were pretty beat from yesterday&#39;s &#39;problem&#39; we all 
stayed over at the shrine to watch her in case the demon came back for 
seconds. I remember that I couldn&#39;t sleep all night worrying about it.

While Usagi and Rei were sleeping inside (yes, she fell asleep) I was 
outside watching the perimeter in my Sailor Venus guise. The reason why 
I was able to transform now of all times... I suspect it had something 
to do with Usagi&#39;s presence.

&quot;Yeah, she went out to finish some business.&quot;

&quot;Must be a phone call home. She&#39;s been around for awhile, it must be 
worrying her husband back at home.&quot;

That&#39;s not it... She&#39;s trying to get your soul back...

&quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; She lifted up the box I had dropped and paused at the storage 
room doorway.

&quot;...Are you happy? I know it may seem like an odd question with what&#39;s 
been going on lately but your life I mean, are you happy with it?&quot; Are 
you happy with your modified life and memories?

Rei lifted an eyebrow and gave me an irritated look. &quot;Why would you ask 
that? It is what it is. You can&#39;t change the past and we don&#39;t know the 
future, so there&#39;s no point in worrying about such things. We&#39;ll all 
just die someday.&quot; The woman turned and disappeared behind the doorway 
flap.

&quot;...&quot; I looked down at the tiled floor.

She never answered the question... Does that mean she&#39;s happy the way 
her life is now or does she see it more as a chore? There must be some 
way to get a straight answer!

&quot;All right, I&#39;ve got it!&quot;

&quot;Got what?&quot;

Oops, I just said that out loud didn&#39;t I? Rei had returned from the back 
room, still frowning.

&quot;After we finish up around here, let&#39;s go see a movie! Everyone needs a 
break now and then. You know what they say, all work and no 
play...hmm...oh darn, I forgot the rest but you get what I mean right?&quot;

&quot;Are you serious?&quot;

&quot;Of course! It&#39;s something to get our minds off things. Besides, if I 
left you alone you&#39;d go back to sulking or moping around. I know you&#39;d 
do it for days at a time too. Can&#39;t let that happen right?&quot;

Rei narrowed her eyes at that last comment. It looked like she was 
thinking about something but then decided to let it go.

&quot;I suppose. BUT I have to finish everything here first.&quot;

&quot;&#39;We&#39;.&quot; I corrected.

&quot;Okay, &#39;we&#39;.&quot; Rei rolled her eyes.

As the miko went to pick up another box, a different thought hit me. 
Without taking time to think about it I said, &quot;Oh, just think. It&#39;s like 
we&#39;re going out on our official first date.&quot;

Trip, CRASH!

Movie Theatre

Rei and I stood outside the building in our disguises where we were 
checking out the different shows playing at the time. As usual there was 
the &#39;romance only&#39; or &#39;action only&#39; films. I mean, I liked both but I 
wanted to see something...different. If I could get Rei to see this one 
film maybe...

&quot;How about that one?&quot; I pointed up towards a science fiction film.

&quot;You want to see that? Do you even know what it&#39;s about or are you 
feeling random today?&quot;

&quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t my fault that you tripped and fell,&quot; I smirked.

&quot;...&quot; Instead of answering back Rei growled and glared with that &#39;if you 
hadn&#39;t said that I wouldn&#39;t have fallen&#39; look.

&quot;And in fact, I do know what the movie is about,&quot; I gestured with my 
hand with the other on my hip. &quot;You&#39;ve heard of the Sailor Senshi right? 
Well, the movie is about the Senshi living on their respective planets, 
as the rulers of course. It goes along the lines that some new evil has 
&#39;arisen&#39; and the rulers are forced to go to Pluto to ward off the evil 
while leaving their kids to take their place as the rulers momentarily. 
Because their heirs were just kids, some things went off someplace and 
the planets formed alliances with each other, creating two different 
sides. It was stupid if you asked me, to put so much power into three 
individual heirs...but it&#39;s just a movie, so anything goes right? 
Besides, I heard there was a lot of fighting and romance! Supposedly the 
Uranus/Neptune heir, Kaiya gets into huge fights against the heir of 
Venus/Mars, Nozomi. I bet you&#39;re dying to see it now too, am I right 
Rei?&quot; I nudged her with an elbow.

But Rei didn&#39;t seem to notice the action. &quot;Sailor Senshi...?&quot; She stared 
at the poster in concentration.

&quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe in them.&quot;

Wha-wha-WHAAAA? This wasn&#39;t how it was supposed to go! &quot;But they are 
real!&quot; I tried to persuade her. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever read the news? They kill 
demons and monsters and, and they use powers to save the world even in 
the face of death!&quot;

&quot;And they run around in skimpy outfits and make corny speeches when they 
should be fighting.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m confused... didn&#39;t you say you didn&#39;t believe in them?&quot;

Rei crossed her arms. &quot;Believing in someone isn&#39;t limited to 
acknowledging a person&#39;s existence. It&#39;s also whether you have faith in 
them or not.&quot;

Whether you have faith in them or not...? Rei, how much do you actually 
remember? Are...are you saying that we all let you down? Is that what 
you mean?

&quot;Anyway, you wanted to see this movie? Then let&#39;s go before there&#39;s a 
long line up.&quot; She took my hand and pulled me towards the door.

But I couldn&#39;t say anything... I could only watch her back as she pulled 
me along and wonder...

After the Movie

It might have just been me, but Rei seemed to be staring intensely at 
the screen throughout the entire film. Even though we were holding 
hands, it felt like she never knew I was there. She felt far away and I 
couldn&#39;t figure it out. Although we&#39;re still going out as Aino Minako 
and Hino Rei, I&#39;m still also Sailor Venus, goddess of love while 
Rei...was only Rei now.

Despite all that...I...I still love her. But does she really feel the 
same way about me or does she do all this out of habit now?

&quot;That was an interesting movie after all,&quot; Rei said off-handedly. &quot;I 
never expected the King and Queen of Uranus/Neptune come back.&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot;

&quot;Mm? What&#39;s wrong Mina? Didn&#39;t you like the movie?&quot; She looked over at 
me.

&quot;Rei, are you really happy with your life?&quot;

&quot;I already told you. It is what it is...&quot;

We both began to walk down the sidewalk and away from the crowds.

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant! Why are you dodging the question?&quot; I demanded.

&quot;And why do you keep asking about it?&quot; She shot back.

&quot;Because--!&quot; Rei turned her head and tried to ignore me but it only 
ticked me off even more. Immediately my hand gripped her cheek and 
turned her head to face me where we glared at each other. &quot;Is there 
something... you aren&#39;t telling me?&quot; I softly said before releasing her.

&quot;...&quot; Rei was no longer glaring.

&quot;How do you expect me to understand you if you don&#39;t tell me what&#39;s 
wrong...? If something is bothering you, I&#39;d like you to tell me. I want 
to help. I&#39;ll listen to whatever you want to say...or maybe...is it 
because you don&#39;t have any faith in me?&quot;

I&#39;ve finally said it.

&quot;...That&#39;s not it,&quot; Rei mumbled but continued to stare straight ahead as 
we began to walk again. &quot;It&#39;s just...well...how to put it? I can&#39;t 
really say how my life is because...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t laugh but it feels like there are blanks in my memories.&quot;

&quot;Wh-at?&quot;

&quot;See? It&#39;s stupid, I shouldn&#39;t have told you.&quot; Rei picked up her speed. 
It had taken me an extra second to realize that she was making fast 
tracks.

I made a few quick steps of my own and caught her by the shoulder, 
prompting her to stop but not enough to force her to turn around.

&quot;No, it&#39;s not stupid. I believe you. It&#39;s just...it surprised me, that&#39;s 
all. What did you mean by blanks?&quot;

Her shoulders relaxed a bit. &quot;That&#39;s what I mean. When I think back, 
there are times where I have no clue where I was or what I was doing. I 
can remember what I was doing before and after in various spots but I 
can&#39;t remember what happened between the two. I didn&#39;t think it was 
weird at first...but when I gave it more thought, I realized that it 
wasn&#39;t in just one or two places...it was more than that, it was a lot. 
I tried asking the sacred fire but it wouldn&#39;t tell me anything. I get 
nothing...Who knows, maybe I&#39;m losing my touch...&quot; Rei turned partially 
around. &quot;I bet you think...

&quot;Do I think what?&quot;

&quot;...that I&#39;m weird now...&quot; her voice trailed off.

I surprised her with a hug and laughed. &quot;Is that what&#39;s bothering you? 
Silly, you couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth! I love you and still do.&quot;

&quot;C-Could you not say that so loud?&quot; Rei blushed as she peeled me off.

&quot;Why, are you embarrassed?&quot; I continued to watch the woman as blood 
rushed to her face. So cute... If she weren&#39;t so shy with showing 
attention in public, I would have given her a kiss right now. In fact, 
maybe I will.

kiss

&quot;Hey!&quot;

...On the cheek.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t so bad was it?&quot; I winked. &quot;Come on, admit it. You liked 
it.&quot; Rei quickly began to walk away again, trying to leave me behind. 
&quot;Sheesh, always running ain&#39;t ya?&quot; I jogged to catch up again.

Blanks in her memories huh? I&#39;m assuming she&#39;s talking about the ones in 
this life. There&#39;s no way she would remember anything about his past 
life now...

Tup! Tup! Tup...

&quot;Rei, if you could remember what filled those blanks in your 
memory...would you want to remember?&quot;

&quot;What kind of question is that? Of course I&#39;d like to remember!&quot;

I had to be sure about this.

&quot;...But what if they were sad memories? What if they were hard 
struggles...?&quot;

Rei paused for a moment before finally saying, &quot;I&#39;d still want to 
remember. Even if they were sad and especially if they were full of 
struggles. What would life be without struggling? Too easy if you ask 
me, you can&#39;t get anything for free... it sounds almost superficial, to 
never have suffered.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; But what we&#39;ve all gone through was harder than most... It&#39;s not 
the same thing as what you&#39;re thinking. There are far more burdens to 
being a part of the Sailor Senshi than being an ordinary girl.

&quot;...What if it brought more struggles?&quot; I said quietly.

&quot;I&#39;d still want to know.&quot; My head shot up. I can&#39;t say I was expecting 
that answer. &quot;If there&#39;s something that I&#39;m missing then I&#39;ll look for 
it, no matter what it takes. Good or bad.&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot;

So that&#39;s it?

I couldn&#39;t help but feel relaxed and content to hear her say all of 
this. It meant...that I have an answer-to get Mar&#39;s soul back to Rei. If 
that&#39;s what she wants, then I&#39;ll do anything I can to make that come 
true. It was after all, her missing piece, the other half to her soul.

&quot;Oh, could you wait up for a minute Rei-chan? I need to duck into our 
studio and grab my sweater. I think I left it there from our last 
recording.&quot;

The idea had struck me since we were passing the studio building anyway.

&quot;All right, just hurry okay?&quot;

&quot;Afraid of the female admirers?&quot;

&quot;Humph. Go already,&quot; She pushed me forward. &quot;I don&#39;t have to hear this 
from you.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay, I got it. I&#39;ll be right back so wait for me.&quot; I gave her 
another peck on the cheek.

&quot;Stop that you!&quot; She yelled as I made my get away.

Tup, tup, tup, tup...

Studio Room

I opened the door with my key and then entered the dark room. I guess 
everyone already left for the day...

I flicked on the light switch and ventured around the corner to a small 
waiting room. &quot;Now let&#39;s see...Aha! Found it!&quot; It was right where I left 
it, on the couch. Silly me. Rei will probably make fun of me for leaving 
it behind after she told me over and over not to forget it.

Tup...tup...

My ears perked up. Someone else is here?

&quot;Manuke?&quot; I blinked to make sure I was really seeing our manager here. 
&quot;Did you forget something too?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; The man stared blankly at me. It was kinda creepy.

Okay, is he out of it or something?

I took a step forward towards him when a sudden bad vibe tore through my 
body, sending my senses on the sudden alert. Where did this energy come 
from? Was it...from Manuke? All I did was take a step towards him and 
then...That had to be it! But why?

&quot;Welcome Aino Minako. Teen idol, or should I be more formal and bow, 
Sailor Venus?&quot;

WHAT?

&quot;Excuse me? I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about. Manuke, are 
you drunk or something?&quot;

&quot;You know perfectly about what I&#39;m talking about, goddess of love.&quot; He 
mocked. &quot;I just thought you&#39;d be interested.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m not interested in you.&quot;

&quot;...Stop talking about trivial nonsense!&quot; Manuke spat. &quot;As if this human 
was worth the time and effort you&#39;re wasting now.&quot;

&quot;Human...?&quot; It suddenly made sense. &quot;You couldn&#39;t be that demon--?&quot;

&quot;Precisely,&quot; It smirked. &quot;Perhaps I should congratulate you on figuring 
that much out,&quot; and then it clapped it&#39;s hands together with a laugh. 
&quot;Ahh...It&#39;s great to have a body again.&quot;

&quot;Stop mocking me, I&#39;m not that weak! Now hand it over!&quot;

&quot;Hand what over?&quot; It gave an amused look, trying to look innocent.

&quot;You know what I&#39;m talking about! Give me back Mar&#39;s soul!&quot;

&quot;Just like that? Don&#39;t be a silly child. I don&#39;t give anything out for 
free. And don&#39;t even think about transforming ahahaha. I may hold Mar&#39;s 
soul now but in a snap of a finger I can...shall we say, permanently rid 
this world of it.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&quot;

&quot;Do I? It appears you are in no situation to order me about Venus. Times 
change you know?&quot;

&quot;Then...what do you want?&quot; I slowly said and gave a hateful glare.

&quot;Your life...Your soul...But not in any regular way, that would be too 
boring. I want you to marry me. It would be perfectly legal.&quot;

My clenched hands were shaking, &quot;Liar, you just want to cause Rei more 
pain.&quot;

&quot;So what if I do? Does it really matter? Do you think she really cares 
about you? Mars was the one who loved you and you, only love Hino Rei 
because she was Mar&#39;s reincarnate.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re wrong, it&#39;s nothing like that. Besides, what do you know of 
love?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s irrelevant. Now answer the question, do we have a deal? I will 
return Mar&#39;s soul to Hino Rei if you agree to be my bride and give me 
your life and soul for eternity. Nothing too difficult to understand.&quot;

&quot;How do I know you won&#39;t go back on your word?&quot;

&quot;Blood contract. If I go back on my word, then I die. Simple isn&#39;t it? 
And why would I? I can get two souls for the price of one, Venus&#39;s and 
yours. It&#39;s a irresistible bargain. To actually own the goddess of 
love&#39;s soul...love you see is something we demons despise the most. 
Imagine the fun I could have torturing you.&quot;

...But what if they were sad memories? What if they were hard 
struggles...?

I&#39;d still want to remember. Even if they were sad and especially if they 
were full of struggles. What would life be without struggling? Too easy 
if you ask me, you can&#39;t get anything for free... it sounds almost 
superficial, to never have suffered.

...What if it brought more struggles?

I&#39;d still want to know. If there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing then I&#39;ll look 
for it, no matter what it takes. Good or bad.

...No matter what...Heh...

&quot;You...got yourself a deal.&quot;

FwooooooooooOOOSH!

Sometime later outside the building

&quot;There you are Mina chan! What took you so long?&quot; Rei walked over to me.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot; I turned to leave but she grabbed my arm.

&quot;It&#39;s not nothing, I can see it written all over your face.&quot; She pushed. 
Was she worried about me?

&quot;Look...I-I&#39;m sorry Rei, I&#39;m just...a bit tired that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Oh...well I told you not to overdo things. What do you say we go home 
and rest? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel better with some sleep.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

...One day...is all I have left...only one day...
