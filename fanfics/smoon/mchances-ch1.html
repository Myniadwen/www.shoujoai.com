<h1>Missed Chances</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello everyone! We hope you had a safe and wonderful Holiday 
Season! We also hope you enjoy this story. It&#39;s about ChibiUsa and 
Hotaru. It goes along the same timeline as our other stories with 
the two of them. Sorry it took us so long to finish this one, but 
we&#39;ve been pretty busy lately and it took us a while to finally 
type this up. We&#39;ve already started our next story which should be longer 
than most of our stories and it will take place in an alternate 
timeline from the one we&#39;re currently writing about. We&#39;d like to 
thank everybody who has encouraged our writing so far. And please, 
we love e-mail from people who read our stories, so if you have 
time, we&#39;d love to hear what you think.

	&quot;This college stuff isn&#39;t fair,&quot; grumbled Usagi. She, Minako, 
and Ami were sitting in the library studying.
	&quot;And why is that?&quot; asked Ami.
	&quot;Well, from what we&#39;ve heard about the future from ChibiUsa 
and Setsuna, I&#39;m going to be Neo Queen Serenity in a couple of 
years. I shouldn&#39;t be worrying about college right now,&quot; said 
Usagi.
	&quot;All the more reason to take it. That way you&#39;ll be a better 
ruler and not totally screw us all,&quot; said Minako.
	&quot;You hate it just as much as I do,&quot; said Usagi.
	&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s going to be the neo queen,&quot; 
Minako answered.
	Usagi stood up. &quot;I&#39;m going to put these books back up. Is 
there anything you want me to bring back?&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Just get back quickly. There are a few 
things I want to go over and then we can leave,&quot; said Ami.
	&quot;We&#39;re almost done? Great! I&#39;ll be back in a minute,&quot; said 
Usagi. She turned to leave and walked right into ChibiUsa, the 
armful of books the younger girl had been carrying clattered to the 
floor.
	&quot;Baka Usagi. Don&#39;t you ever watch where you&#39;re going? 
ChibiUsa kneeled down and started picking up the books she had 
dropped.
	&quot;You weren&#39;t looking either,&quot; Usagi said defensively.
	&quot;There you are. Sorry I took so long finding the books I 
wanted. Are you okay? What happened?&quot; asked Hotaru as she walked 
up. She leaned down and helped ChibiUsa pick up the books.
	ChibiUsa looked up when she saw Hotaru. Her eyes seemed to 
brighten. &quot;I&#39;m fine. Usagi and I collided. I guess I got all of my 
klutziness from her,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She picked up the last of the 
books and stood up.
	&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s bad. I think it&#39;s cute,&quot; said Hotaru. 
ChibiUsa&#39;s eyes went wide. Usagi, Ami, and Minako looked at Hotaru 
strangely. Hotaru just looked at ChibiUsa innocently. She turned to 
Usagi. &quot;So, how are you doing, Usagi?&quot; she asked politely.
	Usagi looked at her for several seconds before replying. Had 
she said that her future daughter&#39;s klutziness was cute? &quot;I&#39;m doing 
pretty well. We were just about done studying. Then we&#39;re going to 
get something to eat.&quot;
	&quot;That sounds good,&quot; said ChibiUsa, getting hungry.
	&quot;So do you both have a big test coming up?&quot; asked Usagi, 
indicating the books ChibiUsa was holding.
	&quot;No. These are all the books Hotaru wants to check out. How 
she can read like that, I&#39;ll never know. You should see her room. 
There are books everywhere,&quot; ChibiUsa said. &#39;She doesn&#39;t even 
notice me when she&#39;s reading.&#39;
	&quot;Oh, it&#39;s not that bad,&quot; said Hotaru. &quot;And I always notice 
you,&quot;
	&quot;You get really wrapped up in it. It&#39;s like the rest of the 
world isn&#39;t there,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;No. I like reading, but that&#39;s not what happens. Only one 
thing make me feel like the rest of the world isn&#39;t there, and it&#39;s 
a lot more important to me than any book I&#39;ve ever read,&quot; said 
Hotaru.
	&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Maybe I&#39;m not looking at the books as much as you think I 
am,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;So do you two want to have dinner with us?&quot; asked Minako.
	&quot;Actually, we were going back to Hotaru&#39;s house after this.
Haruka and Michiru are on a date tonight, Setsuna&#39;s rearranging 
things in the Time Palace. Don&#39;t ask me why,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;And I&#39;d be lonely by myself, so I wanted ChibiUsa to stay 
with me,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;You two have fun then,&quot; said Usagi as ChibiUsa and Hotaru 
waved and walked away.
	&quot;That was strange,&quot; said Minako.
	&quot;Yeah. I swear they act like a couple sometimes. And what 
were some of those things they were talking about?&quot; asked Usagi.
	&quot;They&#39;re kids,&quot; said Minako.
	&quot;They&#39;re teenagers,&quot; Ami corrected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hotaru and ChibiUsa arrived at Hotaru&#39;s house. Hotaru closed 
the door behind them. 
	&quot;Would you like anything to drink, Odango-chan?&quot; Hotaru 
asked.
	&quot;Yeah, that would be nice,&quot; ChibiUsa answered. She followed
Hotaru into the kitchen.
	Hotaru opened the refrigerator and started looking for 
something to drink for ChibiUsa. She felt ChibiUsa walk up to her 
from behind. Her arms encircled Hotaru&#39;s waist. She leaned her head 
against Hotaru&#39;s shoulder. Hotaru was just slightly taller than she 
was, so ChibiUsa fit perfectly against her.
	&quot;Why did you do that earlier?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.
	Hotaru smiled. &quot;You should know me well enough by now. Why do 
you think I did?&quot;
	ChibiUsa sighed, an altogether pleasant sensation for Hotaru. 
&quot;Because you hate acting like we&#39;re just friends and you want 
everyone to know that I&#39;m your odango-chan.&quot;
	&quot;Yep,&quot; said Hotaru. She turned around in ChibiUsa&#39;s embrace 
so that she was facing the other girl. &quot;And I was just being honest 
while we were talking to Usagi.&quot;
	&quot;So you really do think that my klutziness is cute?&quot; ChibiUsa 
asked.
	&quot;Absolutely. I have ever since I met you,&quot; Hotaru answered. 
ChibiUsa smiled. 
	&quot;I love you, Hotaru,&quot; she said as she kissed the dark haired 
girl. &quot;I only wish my first kiss had been with you and not Helios.&quot;
	Hotaru blushed. &quot;It wasn&#39;t.&quot;
	&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.
	&quot;It happened before I was changed into a baby.&quot; Hotaru 
blushed  deeper as she continued. &quot;I was sleeping over at your 
house. I was still shocked by the fact that you had invited me 
over. Or that you even wanted to be my friend. No one else cared 
about me, but you did. I was falling in love with you.&quot;
	&quot;But I was a kid, Hotaru,&quot; said ChibiUsa, surprised by what 
Hotaru was saying.
	&quot;That didn&#39;t matter to me. And didn&#39;t you go after some 
people back when you were that age? Anyway, you had fallen asleep 
and I stayed awake to watch you. You were so beautiful. I started 
to wonder what it would be like if you and I were together. I guess 
I got a little carried away while imagining that. I wanted to know 
what it would be like to kiss you, so after working up the courage, 
I did.&quot;
	&quot;I thought that was just a dream I had,&quot; said ChibiUsa. &quot;I 
remember feeling bad in the morning because I had had an ecchi 
dream about my best friend.&quot;
	&quot;It wasn&#39;t ecchi. It was romantic that you&#39;d dream about me,&quot; 
said Hotaru.
	&quot;Though the dream was happening in real life. I sure missed 
out,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She looked into Hotaru&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;m glad you 
were my first kiss, even if I didn&#39;t realize it.&quot;
	Hotaru giggled. &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad I did then. I almost didn&#39;t, 
but you were so cute while you were sleeping. I wanted to know what 
kissing you would be like.&quot;
	&quot;Now you know. And you can whenever you want,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;I&#39;ll have to take you up on that offer,&quot; said Hotaru as her 
lips gently met ChibiUsa&#39;s. Their kiss grew more passionate as the 
girls let down the guise of only being friends in the solitude of 
the house. Hotaru felt warm inside. It was as if so many things had 
opened for her when she had admitted how she felt about ChibiUsa to 
the pink-haired girl and herself. She had kissed ChibiUsa before, 
while she was asleep, but she had tried to suppress her feelings 
for the other girl after that. She had know that she had very 
strong emotions for ChibiUsa, but she hadn&#39;t quite known what they 
meant. She was so happy to have learned that ChibiUsa loved her, 
too.
	ChibiUsa was a bit surprised when she felt Hotaru&#39;s tongue 
push into her mouth. Their breath mingled as they kissed. ChibiUsa 
loved the way Hotaru&#39;s soft lips felt against her own. Hotaru&#39;s 
hand slowly went up to ChibiUsa&#39;s blouse and started to undo the 
bow of her school uniform.
	&quot;I don&#39;t know if you noticed or not, but I had been acting 
differently for the past couple of weeks before we got together,&quot; 
said ChibiUsa. 
	&quot;How so?&quot; asked Hotaru.
	&quot;Well, I kept coming up for excuses for what I was doing, but 
I knew. I was always trying to look my best for you. To make sure I 
made a good impression every time I saw you. I told myself that I 
was just trying to look pretty and there was nothing wrong with 
girl trying ton look pretty when she&#39;s around her friend,&quot; said 
ChibiUsa.
	Hotaru giggled again. &quot;So that&#39;s what you were doing. You 
shouldn&#39;t have worried. I had already noticed how pretty you were 
before you started doing that. And if it helps any, I kept telling 
myself that there was nothing wrong with a girl noticing how pretty 
her friend is.&quot; She kissed ChibiUsa again and started to unbutton 
her shirt. ChibiUsa blushed as Hotaru removed her clothes. She 
noticed that Hotaru&#39;s cheeks were flushed as well. ChibiUsa ran her 
hand along Hotaru&#39;s leg. She stopped when she reached Hotaru&#39;s 
thigh. She slid her fingers under the tight cloth of Hotaru&#39;s dark 
stockings. She slid the cloth down and off of Hotaru&#39;s leg. She 
repeated the process with Hotaru&#39;s other leg. ChibiUsa reached 
under Hotaru&#39;s skirt again and pulled her panties down and past her
feet.
	The two girls looked at each other. ChibiUsa was only clad in 
her unbuttoned blouse. Hotaru looked up and down ChibiUsa&#39;s lovely 
body. ChibiUsa&#39;s hand ran under Hotaru&#39;s skirt, caressing her soft 
skin. Hotaru leaned her shoulders back as ChibiUsa&#39;s other hand 
started to unbutton her school blouse. Hotaru&#39;s hands went up to 
ChibiUsa&#39;s shoulders. ChibiUsa was a bit tense, still. Hotaru 
started to rub away the weariness from ChibiUsa. Hotaru kissed 
ChibiUsa&#39;s shoulder as ChibiUsa removed Hotaru&#39;s bra. Hotaru 
felt ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers brush against her inner thigh. Hotaru let 
ChibiUsa&#39;s gentle touch envelop her. &quot;Hotaru, you are so 
beautiful,&quot; said ChibiUsa. 
	Hotaru leaned towards ChibiUsa. &quot;So are you, my Odango-chan,&quot; 
said Hotaru. She cupped the other girls breasts with her hands. 
ChibiUsa moaned lightly. ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers reached their 
destination between Hotaru&#39;s legs. She started rubbing slow circles 
around Hotaru&#39;s nether lips. ChibiUsa sighed as she felt Hotaru 
gently massaging her breasts. Hotaru slid one hand away from 
ChibiUsa&#39;s breast and started to run it down her body. Hotaru 
brought her mouth to ChibiUsa&#39;s breast. She licked ChibiUsa&#39;s 
nipple, causing the pink haired girl to shudder from the pleasure 
she was getting. ChibiUsa brought her other hand up to Hotaru&#39;s 
breasts. She pinched one of Hotaru&#39;s nipples, bringing forth a moan 
from her lover. ChibiUsa felt Hotaru&#39;s soft lips wrap around her 
nipple as Hotaru started to suckle her. Hotaru moaned again as she
felt one of ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers slide into her vagina. Hotaru licked 
to the top of ChibiUsa&#39;s breast. Hotaru lightly pushed ChibiUsa 
onto her back on the floor. ChibiUsa continued to pump her finger 
in and out of Hotaru. Hotaru&#39;s hand went down across ChibiUsa&#39;s 
stomach and down between her legs. Hotaru&#39;s hand ran through 
ChibiUsa&#39;s pubic hair before stopping at her entrance. Hotaru used 
to fingers to open ChibiUsa&#39;s inner lips. She slid one of her 
fingers into ChibiUsa. ChibiUsa gasped as she felt Hotaru&#39;s finger 
inside her. Hotaru loved the way ChibiUsa&#39;s body felt against her 
own. ChibiUsa moaned as she felt Hotaru&#39;s fingers stroke her 
clitoris. Hotaru opened her legs further to allow ChibiUsa further 
access into her. Both girls moaned the others name as they reached 
orgasm.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;ChibiUsa?&quot; Hotaru asked sleepily.
	&quot;Yes, &#39;Taru-chan?&quot; replied ChibiUsa as she absentmindedly ran 
her fingers through Hotaru&#39;s hair.
	&quot;What did you think of me after you had that dream?&quot; asked 
Hotaru.
	ChibiUsa thought for a moment. &quot;I thought you were very 
pretty. And very shy.&quot; 
	&quot;You were my first friend. I was nervous about losing you 
when you got to know me,&quot; said Hotaru. &quot;I didn&#39;t know what to do. 
With the exception of my dad, nobody cared if I lived or died.&quot;
	&quot;You seemed really lonely. I wanted you to feel better since 
you had a friend. I hated those kids at your school for treating 
you the way they did,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;They were all scared of my healing powers. They didn&#39;t want 
anything to do with me.&quot; Hotaru held ChibiUsa closer as memories 
started coming back to her.
	&quot;I really wanted to know you better. I thought it was so 
great to spend time with you,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;So, did you have any romantic feelings towards me back 
then?&quot; asked Hotaru.
	&quot;My whole childhood I was sure that one day I&#39;d meet a 
charming prince and that he and I would live happily ever after and 
rule Crystal Tokyo. That&#39;s what I heard from my parents and what I 
think everyone expected. No one ever told me what would happen if I 
fell in love with a princess instead. That&#39;s why I was so confused 
about a certain mysterious, dark haired girl,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;I wonder who that lucky girl could be,&quot; said Hotaru as she 
lovingly kissed ChibiUsa.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	ChibiUsa was sitting on Usagi&#39;s bed while Usagi was getting 
ready for a date with Mamoru. Usagi looked at different outfits in 
the mirror, trying to find the right one.
	&quot;Usagi, I have a question,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	Usagi was surprised. ChibiUsa usually didn&#39;t come to her for 
advice. &quot;Okay, what is it?&quot; asked Usagi.
	&quot;Ummmm... well, it&#39;s perfectly normal for a girl to get a 
crush on another girl, right? I mean, if the girl really admires 
the other girl and they&#39;re really close? It doesn&#39;t mean anything, 
right?&quot; asked ChibiUsa nervously.
	Usagi tried to understand what ChibiUsa had just said. From 
the way ChibiUsa had been talking a month ago, Usagi had been sure 
that ChibiUsa was going to visit a sick boy she liked, but it had 
turned out to be a girl named Hotaru that she was visiting. Usagi 
had dismissed the idea of ChibiUsa having a crush on the person, 
but what if she had been right in the first place? &quot;ChibiUsa, is 
there something you want to tell me?&quot;
	ChibiUsa looked at her annoyed. &quot;No. I just want you to 
answer my question.&quot;
	&quot;Why are you asking then?&quot; asked Usagi.
	&quot;Because, okay?&quot; Now answer my question,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;First you have to tell me why,&quot; said Usagi. &quot;It&#39;s because of 
that girl you met in the park, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
	&quot;No! It is not!&quot; said ChibiUsa. She thought quickly. &quot;It&#39;s 
just that I thought you liked Haruka and I want to make sure that 
you&#39;ll still get with Mamoru.&quot;
	&quot;I do not like Haruka. And you better not tell Mamo-chan that 
I do,&quot; said Usagi. ChibiUsa walked to the door. &quot;Where are you 
going?&quot; asked Usagi.
	&quot;Downstairs, so I can wait for Mamoru,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She 
stuck out her tongue at Usagi and ran downstairs.
	&quot;ChibiUsa!!!&quot; yelled Usagi.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hotaru smiled. &quot;Did you really ask Usagi that?&quot; 
	&quot;Yes,&quot; said ChibiUsa. &quot;I had to talk to somebody. You were 
scaring me. I was looking for a nice boyfriend and I was starting 
to feel strangely about another girl. That wasn&#39;t supposed to 
happen.&quot;
	&quot;What were you afraid of?&quot; asked Hotaru.
	&quot;I&#39;m the heir to Neo Queen Serenity and the senshi of the 
future moon and I was falling in love with the senshi of silence. I 
had a lot to worry about. And I admit that I was a little scared. 
But that&#39;s a lot for a kid to deal with. And you weren&#39;t helping. 
You just confused me more,&quot; said ChibiUsa.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;This doll is so kawaii!&quot; said ChibiUsa as she picked up the 
doll off Hotaru&#39;s dresser. It slightly resembled Hotaru with short, 
dark hair and purple eyes. It wore a beautiful kimono.
	&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Hotaru as she smiled at her friend&#39;s 
enthusiasm. &quot;My mother gave it to me when I was fairly young... a 
couple months before she died.&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s so sad,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She looked at the doll closer 
as a tear ran down her cheek.
	&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry,&quot; said Hotaru gently. &quot;I miss my mom, but I 
don&#39;t want to forget about her. I like to remember the good times I 
spent with her. The doll helps remind me of those times.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s not fair, Hotaru,&quot; said ChibiUsa, clutching the doll as 
if it could make all the sadness and despair she was feeling go 
away.
	Hotaru was shocked to see ChibiUsa so sad all of the sudden.
&quot;It&#39;s okay ChibiUsa,&quot; said Hotaru, trying to comfort her friend.
	&quot;No, it&#39;s not,&quot; cried ChibiUsa as several more tears  
trickled down her face. &quot;I have both my parents and their friends 
and I still act like a brat sometimes. You lost your mom when you 
were a little girl, your father spends most of his time in a lab, 
and all the kids at your school are so mean to you. It&#39;s not fair,&quot; 
ChibiUsa&#39;s head lowered slightly. Hotaru kissed the younger girl on 
the cheek. ChibiUsa&#39;s head jerked back up, several tears forgotten 
as they ran down her face. ChibiUsa blushed a bright crimson as 
she stared wide-eyed at Hotaru.
	&quot;Hotaru?&quot; ChibiUsa managed weakly.
	Hotaru smiled at her. &quot;ChibiUsa, you&#39;re my best friend. I&#39;m 
happy for that. Please don&#39;t cry.&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Okay,&quot; said Hotaru. &quot;I guess I didn&#39;t make it any easier for 
you.&quot;
	&quot;Nope. You had me confused for a long time,&quot; said ChibiUsa. 
&quot;When did you first know? It took me forever to sort things out.&quot;
	&quot;When did I first know I was in love with you?,&quot; Hotaru 
smiled at the pink haired girl. &quot;It was during the battle with 
Pharaoh 90. After I returned your heart crystal to you, I knew.&quot;
	&quot;I mean when you first knew for sure,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;I know. That was when I first knew for sure that I loved 
you. When I saw you open your eyes and looked at me, I knew I was 
in love,&quot; explained Hotaru.
	&quot;Then why didn&#39;t you say anything for all of these years?&quot; 
asked ChibiUsa confused. 
	&quot;Because I didn&#39;t remember. I was changed into a baby shortly 
after that. It wasn&#39;t until a couple weeks ago after I told you I 
loved you that I remembered,&quot; said Hotaru. &quot;Anyway, what would you 
have done if I had told you before I was changed into a baby? 
Actually, I think I did hint at it right after I realized I loved 
you. 
	&quot;Yes. You said &#39;It&#39;s strange. We&#39;re both girls, but its like 
fate we met,&#39;&quot; said ChibiUsa, trying to sound like Hotaru.
	&quot;What was that?&quot; asked Hotaru.
	&quot;That was my Hotaru impression,&quot; said ChibiUsa smiling.
	&quot;I do not sound like that,&quot; said Hotaru. She playfully pushed 
ChibiUsa. &quot;So what did you think I was talking about when I said 
that? It sounds to me like, &#39;ChibiUsa, even though we&#39;re both 
girls, I feel strangely about you, as if destiny brought us 
together.&#39;&quot;
	ChibiUsa stared at Hotaru. &quot;You&#39;re weird, Taru, but that&#39;s 
just one of the many things I like about you. I understood what you 
were talking about back then, but afterwards I tried not to think 
about it. I was heartbroken after you were changed into a baby. I 
didn&#39;t know what to do. I buried a lot of my feelings about you 
then. I didn&#39;t understand why I felt the way I did at the time.&quot;
	Hotaru looked at ChibiUsa for a while before replying. &quot;I 
love you, Odango-chan.&quot;
	&quot;I love you, Hotaru,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;You&#39;ll never know how glad it makes me feel to hear you say 
that,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;I do because I feel the same way,&quot; said ChibiUsa. Both girls 
looked into each others eyes. The two girls lips met as they kissed 
again.
