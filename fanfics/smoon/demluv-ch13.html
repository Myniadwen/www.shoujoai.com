<a href="../smoon/demluv-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>YURI... an angel gone too soon
 
  Ikuko had known about Rei&#39;s past for a long 
time. As she closed her eyes that night, she 
buried her face into her pillow. But she could 
still see, and hear in vivid detail, the horror 
in the death of one of her best friends as it 
unfolded... 

  Ikuko had been on shift when Senator Hino had 
brought his pregnant wife and her friend, Yuri, 
into the emergency room. Yuri was transported 
immediately to the maternity ward. 
  By Yuri&#39;s request, Ikuko had been asked to be 
one of the nurses to attend Megumi&#39;s premature 
delivery. Ikuko could still remember the knot of 
fear she felt in her guts that day... Yuri was 
hemorrhaging.
  Yuri had been excited, she knew the baby was a 
long awaited boy. She hadn&#39;t understood how 
serious her condition was. Ikuko quietly gave 
the order for blood to be given, but their blood 
supply was low, and Yuri couldn&#39;t wait. When 
Ikuko transfused her own O+ blood on the spot, 
Yuri had been confused.
  Ikuko had held Yuri&#39;s hand and watched 
helplessly by her bedside while the doctors 
valiantly tried to save her long time school 
friend and baby Megumi. She watched as Yuri&#39;s 
husband took a distraught little girl into the 
hallway to observe through the tiny window in 
the door. 
  Ikuko put her head under her pillow, and 
pressed the sides over her ears with her hands. 
But she could still hear Rei&#39;s screams of 
&#39;Mommy&#39; over and over again as she watched her 
mother bleed and not move. She could still hear 
the little girl&#39;s father try to console her in a 
strained voice. Ikuko had gotten light-headed 
and passed out when Yuri died. Megumi had died 3 
days later from complications. He had just been 
too premature.
  Ikuko could almost smell the bouquets of 
Casablanca lilies as she held Kenji&#39;s hand 
tightly the day they attended the double funeral 
service. There had been one large casket, and 
one small shoebox. 
  She had taken notice of the small dark haired 
girl, who stood silent and alone with a 
bewildered expression on her little face. Her 
grief stricken father had been surrounded by 
well-wishers. Ikuko&#39;s heart ached. 
  The funeral scene was just a premonition. Five 
years later, Ikuko saw Yuri&#39;s daughter again as 
she was rushed into her emergency room, battered 
and unconscious. 
  Ikuko was not about to let her friend&#39;s little 
girl die, and had worked hard to stabilize her. 
She and her team had barely managed to save her. 
Rei had needed immediate surgery to stop the 
internal bleeding. Rei was moved to ICU, and 
then eventually to recovery. 
  Shortly after Rei was released, Ikuko had 
handed in her resignation after 15 years of work 
in the emergency room. It had gotten to be too 
much of an emotional drain for her. 
  Kenji and Ikuko had filed for custody of Rei 
when her father was put in jail, but custody was 
awarded to her next of kin. Rei went to live at 
the Hikawa Jinja with her grandfather.
  Ikuko had been glad when, a few years later, 
Usagi had met and befriended Yuri&#39;s lonely 
daughter at the jinja. Senator Hino&#39;s request 
that Rei continue to attend the private TA 
school was honored and funded by his own 
payroll. So Usagi never had an opportunity to 
know her from school.
  Today, Ikuko had to come to grips with her own 
daughter&#39;s molestation... and her preference for 
Rei. Ikuko wept brokenheartedly into her pillow 
for the first time in many, many years... not 
since her friend Yuri had died in her arms at 
the hospital.
  Kenji slid quietly into the bed and put his 
arms comfortingly around his upset wife, &quot;Those 
haunting memories of Yuri have been bothering 
you a lot since Rei&#39;s been staying here, ne?&quot; 
Ikuko nodded against his chest. 
  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. I wish things could have worked 
out differently, too. But you know... we do 
still have each other, and two wonderful 
children of our own... and Rei makes three.&quot; 
  Ikuko blew her nose and she kissed Kenji 
tenderly, &quot;I need you, Kenji.&quot; She whispered. 
  No more words needed to be spoken as Kenji 
undressed his still beautiful bride and made 
long, slow, tender love to her.
