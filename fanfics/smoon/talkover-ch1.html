----------------------------------------------------------------------

Michiru: &#147;I don&#146;t know you anymore.&#148; 

Haruka: &#147;What? What do you mean you don&#146;t know me? Of course you do. I&#146;m 
Haruka, your lover, your partner, your soul mate, anything you put a 
name to as long as I&#146;m yours.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;That&#146;s sweet Haruka, really, but you don&#146;t tell me stuff like 
that nearly enough. You never talk to me &#150; never tell me what you need 
or want or feel... I&#146;m practically living with a stranger.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I haven&#146;t changed, Michi.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Maybe that&#146;s the problem. People do and you just... haven&#146;t. 
You&#146;re still that confused, handsome young woman who likes to race and 
play with her cars.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Play.&#148; 

Michiru: &#147;Haruka.&#148; 

Haruka: &#147;Continue.&#148; 

Michiru: &#147;See? You&#146;re pissed that I don&#146;t take you seriously and you 
still won&#146;t tell me. You&#146;re cold, Haruka. Before you were a little 
reticent but somewhere along the way you became cold.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I don&#146;t know what you want to hear!&#148; 

Michiru: &#147;What ever you have to say, Haruka.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Maybe I don&#146;t have much to say.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Fine. I&#146;m really sorry, Haruka but I can&#146;t... I-I just can&#146;t. 
I&#146;ve tried so hard but you never change! Hotaru&#146;s growing up without you 
and I can&#146;t raise her alone. Setsuna&#146;s trying to help but... she needs 
her papa, Haruka.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Don&#146;t use her against me.&#148; 

Michiru: &#147;I&#146;m sorry. That was low but... God damn it, Haruka! I&#146;m 
hurting here! Talk to me! Tell me what&#146;s wrong, tell me what&#146;s bothering 
you, tell me about your family or something I don&#146;t know but just tell 
me something!&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;*Sigh* All right... I&#146;m sorry. I just-&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Quit apologizing. It pisses me off. You say I&#146;m in the wrong 
and your sorry because you&#146;re telling me how it is.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I&#146;m tired, Haruka. I don&#146;t know what I&#146;m saying.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;You know exactly what you&#146;re saying.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I... (I can do this. This is Michiru. I can do this.) I&#146;m 
sorry, Michi, that I&#146;ve hurt you with... with my silence and... my 
indifference... I didn&#146;t mean to. Please believe me.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;You were right when you said I was... confused. Everything&#146;s 
happening for me all at once. Too fast for me... Setsuna, the Senshi, 
Silence, Hotaru... you... Michi, I&#146;ve never...&#148;

Michiru: &#147;... What Haruka...&#148;?

Haruka: &#147;You deserve better. You deserve... everything. More than I can 
give you.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Do you love me?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Yes.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Say it.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I love you, Michiru Kaiou.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Tell me what love means to you.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Damn it, Michi! I... I&#146;ve never been... good with words.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Try.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Love... for me is... it&#146;s something words can&#146;t describe. I&#146;ve 
said it before - to other women - but I&#146;ve never really known what it 
meant until... well, until you.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I know... I know the moment you walk into the room without even 
looking. I know that... just seeing you makes my heart beat faster or... 
make it stop all together. I-I know the smell of your hair, how the 
colour of your eyes changes with the sea, the texture of your skin 
and... and I know how you like your eggs in the morning and the little 
sounds you make when your happy or sad.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Um... uh... I-I know I feel cold, empty, when you&#146;re not 
around... and that I can&#146;t... stand not having you by my side.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;S-sometimes... sometimes I lay awake at night just to watch you 
sleep. Or I&#146;ll hold my breath to make sure you don&#146;t just... blow away 
or something... Ugh! This is stupid!&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I need you; I want you; I didn&#146;t even know what feeling was 
until I met you. I grew up in a garage working for my uncle until I ran 
away. Street racing was my life and I turned that into a career. The 
money I made went into my education and to the PI that I paid to find my 
family.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Haruka-&#148;

Haruka: &#147;My father died of a brain tumour. Said he was prone to violence 
and that he killed my little sister before he croaked.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;.... and your mother?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Common street whore. I tried to see her. When I told her about 
you, she said she didn&#146;t want me coming around anymore but if I was 
looking for a good time... there was a bitch around the corner.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;What?!&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Uh-huh. Still want me to talk?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I... I don&#146;t want you doing anything your uncomfortable with.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;... No. There was more wasn&#146;t it? Needs, wants, feelings, love, 
family, and... something you haven&#146;t heard before, right?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Haruka-&#148;

Haruka: &#147;You try, Michi. I&#146;ve watched you grow from... Just give me a 
moment. Um... y-you said you needed words... that you&#146;re trying... let 
me try now.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;... Okay...&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Uh... damn... (I can do this. This is Michiru. I can do this. 
For her.) Okay. I love you. I think we cleared that up. Um... damn! 
Why&#146;s this have to be so hard?!&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Haruka-&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I can&#146;t think. Uh... I&#146;m scared. I love you but I&#146;m scared. 
Terrified really.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;We don&#146;t have to do this.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;You need the words. I need to say them &#150; I think. Um... I... 
I&#146;ve never told you this but... I knew the first moment I saw you that I 
would see you again... Um... I was nine when I watched you walk past the 
garage for the first time... after school I&#146;d see you walking with your 
friends and... I&#146;d be happy... for those few seconds. I was happy 
because... I could hear your laugh... see your smile... and watched you 
blush when one of the girls teased you.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Haruka...&#148;?

Haruka: &#147;I-I remember that I wasn&#146;t jealous or envious of what you had 
because... I knew we&#146;d both do great things... Together, I mean. Um... I 
also remember that... one time when I was delivering a package - I was 
about thirteen then - I saw you sitting on the swing. You were so sad so 
naturally... I was sad...&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I got your flowers.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Did they help?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Tremendously.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Good.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I also got those letters.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;G-good.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;&#145;Chin-up&#146; &#145;don&#146;t be afraid&#146; &#145;you have a beautiful smile&#146; 
&#145;always look for the silver lining&#146;...&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Ah ha ha... I-I didn&#146;t know how to read or write then. But I 
wanted so badly for you to smile and I couldn&#146;t just... I was scared 
then... like I am now... so I did the cowardly thing.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;You sent me presents on my birthday every year since.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I was... maybe ten when I saw your picture in the paper... I 
cut it out and saved it... when I learned to read, I found out it was an 
article about your birthday... &#145;Kaiou Princess&#146; Ninth Birthday Blunder&#146;&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Ugh... How was I supposed to know that elephants were afraid 
of mice?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Hah!&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;.... Are we okay...&#148;?

Michiru: &#147;... yes.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Y-your not leaving?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Leaving?!&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Yeah...&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Where did you get - oh no, baby, I didn&#146;t mean I was leaving 
leaving. I just meant that I needed a break. Some time to myself. Clear 
my mind and sort things out.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;You weren&#146;t leaving?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;No! How could you even think I was?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Haruka?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;.... I&#146;m scared...&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I&#146;m not leaving you.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Ha ha... g-guess your not the only one... who needs the words.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I love you, Haruka Kaiou.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Kaiou?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Michi...&#148;?

Michiru: &#147;Will you take my name?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;We&#146;ll legally adopt Hotaru and be a certified family.&#148; 

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Haruka?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;... A-are you... asking me to marry you?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;We&#146;ll get Rei or Usagi to do the ceremony and have all the 
Senshi there.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;It&#146;ll be a small service here in our back yard or at the 
Hikawa Shrine. Makoto could make the cake, Minako could help with the 
decorations, Setsuna could make our suits or dresses and Ami... she 
could help with the planning.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Haruka?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Say something... please?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;....&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Your scaring me. Look, I&#146;ve even got the ring. See? It&#146;s been 
passed down since my great-great-great grandmother. It&#146;s nothing all 
that great but... it&#146;s special. To me. Haruka, please say something.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I&#146;m speechless.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Okay, that&#146;s a start...&#148; 

Haruka: &#147;I... give me a minute.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;....&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Okay... Um... I wanted... I wanted to do this right but... 
words, words... uh... This... what happened today is probably 
something... that&#146;ll happen tomorrow... or the next day. Maybe not 
exactly but... I love you, with all of my heart and soul. You&#146;re 
everything to me, and I am nothing without you.&#148; 

Michiru: &#147;Haruka-&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Wait... um... if we were to fight for everyday of the rest of 
our lives, I&#146;d be the most frustrated... and most probably happiest 
woman in the universe, if only to know th-that it&#146;s you I&#146;m fighting 
with. It doesn&#146;t matter how angry or upset with you I am, I promise... 
that by the time the sun sets I&#146;ll come back and... I&#146;ll talk it over 
with you... and every time I hold you... before I go to sleep at 
night... or when I wake up in the morning... I&#146;ll tell you that I love 
you. There. Um... I&#146;d be honoured to take your name and uh... th-this 
was the ring that... I planned on giving you... um... here.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;It&#146;s beautiful.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Hmmm...&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Thank you.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I-it&#146;s me who should be thankful...&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I love you, Haruka Kaiou.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I love you too, wife.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Here&#146;s your ring. Sorry it couldn&#146;t be more-&#148;

Haruka: &#147;It&#146;s perfect. Not too glittery, simple but elegant... and 
sentimental. And here is yours. All shine and sparkle but it&#146;s no family 
heir loom.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Aquamarine?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I-it made me think of you.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I love it.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;So... Haruka Kaiou... I like it.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Me too.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;When is Hotaru Kaiou due home?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Tomorrow evening. But you know, it&#146;s a long weekend so it 
shouldn&#146;t be a problem for her to stay at Chibi-Usa&#146;s another night.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;And Setsuna?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Gone for some conference in the states.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Mrs. Kaiou. It&#146;s not like you to be so... uninformed.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;You think I give a damn about some seminar when my fianc&eacute;&#146;s 
right here?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;How about... if your fianc&eacute; brought you to the bedroom?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Will you carry me, Haruka?&#148;

Haruka: &#147;I love the way you say my name.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Haruka... I love it when you hold me. Such contradictions. 
Strong and firm but soft and gentle.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Want me to carry you, wife?&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Oh yeah.&#148;

Haruka: &#147;All right.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;Whoa! Haruka let me down! Put me down this instant! Damn it, 
Haruka, let me go!!&#148;

Haruka: &#147;Never. ^.^ Even angry, my name sounds beautiful coming from 
your lips. And you said I was a mass of contradictions? Pick me up then 
put me down, hold me yet let me go. Well, Mrs. Kaiou, here&#146;s some news 
for you. I don&#146;t plan on letting you go for a long, long time.&#148;

Michiru: &#147;I&#146;m counting on that, love.&#148;


Hey, you know, maybe that&#146;s not half bad. I wrote it in just a couple of 
hours some time in the middle of the night. I had that first line stuck 
in my head and everything kind of worked from there. I&#146;m not sure 
whether or not to leave it in script form or write it out as a story. 

Comments? Please, I&#146;d appreciate it if you send me a letter or 
something, at least this way I&#146;ll know what my readers think of it.

Much thx,
Taryn
