<h1>Absence (part 47 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch46.html">Back to Part 46</a><pre>&quot;Look out!&quot; Sailor Mars cried out sharply, before pushing Sailor Moon 
aside and desperately springing to her feet, leaping backwards as the 
blade of Sailor Saturn&#39;s Silence Glaive scraped the section of cement 
roof where she had knelt, sending a spray of sparks into the ash filled 
air.

Mars sucked in her stomach as the Senshi of Death horizontally slashed 
at her, narrowly avoiding a disembowelling blow. Almost instantly 
afterwards, the Fire Senshi threw her head back as Saturn fluidly 
followed up the strike with a swing to the face, bringing the bottom of 
her Glaive up in an attempt to pulverise the miko&#39;s cranium. Sailor Mars 
then darted quickly backwards, willing her exhausted body to move and 
put more space between herself and the apparently insane Senshi of 
Death.

&quot;Hotaru! What are you doing?!&quot; Sailor Mars heard Sailor Venus exclaim in 
astonishment and horror as Sailor Saturn continued her onslaught, 
lunging at the frantically retreating Inner Senshi, mercilessly trying 
to skewer her on the sharp point of her Glaive.

Sailor Saturn ignored the Senshi of Love&#39;s shocked shriek, seemingly 
wholly focused on the task of slaying Sailor Mars, the pale girl&#39;s 
countenance a picture of cold and efficient purpose. She once again 
attacked the Fire Senshi, hacking at her target with her Silence Glaive 
in a downwards-vertical stroke, forcing Sailor Mars to dive to one side, 
the miko&#39;s fast manoeuvre creating a puff of grey and black ash in her 
wake. Mars tucked in her shoulder, performing a roll across a mixture of 
blood and ash that covered the ground as a shining razor sharp 
instrument only barely missed severing her spinal cord, the miko acutely 
aware of a breath of wind just behind the nape of her neck as the Outer 
Senshi&#39;s unique weapon passed by.

However, as soon as Sailor Mars righted herself, she was greeted by the 
butt of Sailor Saturn&#39;s Glaive smashing into her jaw, snapping her head 
forcefully to the upper right. A split second later, she gasped in pain 
as her left thigh was torn ruthlessly open, creating a spray of crimson 
to splatter onto the rooftop, joining the internal fluids of the many 
brutally maimed and burnt bodies densely piled up around the area. Mars 
staggered backwards, tripping over a charred and slowly rotting youma 
corpse just as the Senshi of Death performed a devastating uppercut with 
her Silence Glaive --the blade leading-- shredding the dark purple bow 
that adorned the front of the fleeing Sailor&#39;s fuku and unravelling the 
knot that held the material together as the raven-haired girl fell, the 
lucky stumble saving her from being gutted. Sailor Mars landed heavily 
on her back and quickly raised her head to get a glimpse of her 
relentless assailant&#39;s position, only to have the end of a solid metal 
pole rammed against her forehead, knocking her skull back to crack 
against the hard cement roof, making the tortured girl&#39;s eyes scrunch 
shut in torment. Half-dazed and in terrible agony, the Senshi of Fire 
blindly rolled her body to the right as she heard a sound of something 
fast swooping through the air. There was a loud clang as what was no 
doubt Sailor Saturn&#39;s Silence Glaive collided with the ground, bringing 
up a shower of cement pebbles that bounced off Mars&#39; back.

Sailor Mars opened her pain-wracked eyes and weakly clambered to her 
feet, knowing that the embodiment of Death had her lethal scythe sailing 
towards her vulnerable blindside. People were screaming out all around 
her; the survivors of the Juuban High School massacre in terror, all 
most likely speculating what new nightmare now awaited them in the form 
of their &#39;saviours&#39;; and Sailor Venus and Sailor Moon, both emphatically 
crying out to Sailor Saturn to cease her assault on the battered Sailor 
Mars. Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s voice was noticeably absent, even in the cacophony 
surrounding the miko.

Sailor Mars howled in absolute anguish as the Senshi of Death&#39;s 
murderous weapon raked down her back, ripping open cloth and flesh alike 
as if it was paper, the power of the attack enough to knock the miko 
forwards and down to her knees, scratching off several layers of skin 
from the joints on the gravel rooftop. Sailor Mars turned her abused 
form limply over onto her back, looking up at Sailor Saturn through 
blurry eyes, tears of suffering collecting in the orbs.

&quot;I won&#39;t let you endanger Chibi-Usa!&quot; the Outer Senshi screamed 
vehemently, shaking her Silence Glaive furiously at the prone and 
bleeding girl, her frosty expression breaking for an instant. So that 
was it. Didn&#39;t Sailor Saturn know that Sailor Mars would be victorious 
against Destiny? Didn&#39;t she know that Time would find a way to preserve 
Chibi-Usa&#39;s existence?

&quot;Stop it Hotaru!!&quot; Sailor Moon shouted, quickly stepping in front of her 
defenceless lover and the enraged Senshi of Death, spreading out her 
arms wide as if to somehow shield her bodyguard. &quot;That&#39;s enough! Leave 
her alone!!&quot;

Sailor Saturn merely stared at the blonde for a moment, and then glared 
at her accusingly. &quot;How could you?!&quot; she cried, her visage an image of 
pain and shattered trust. &quot;How could you do this to her?! HOW CAN YOU 
RISK CHIBI-USA&#39;S LIFE LIKE THIS?!&quot;

From her current angle, Sailor Mars couldn&#39;t see Sailor Moon&#146;s face, but 
she could imagine what it was like. Damn Saturn and her judgemental 
attitude; she threatened to ruin everything Mars had strived so hard to 
achieve. The Senshi of Fire gritted her teeth and began to climb to her 
feet, the raven-haired girl&#39;s wounded body aching all the while. Sailor 
Saturn, seeing movement from her prey out of the corner of one eye, 
roughly shoved Sailor Moon aside as her features turned to ice once 
more, the Senshi of Death bringing down her Glaive in a diagonal slice 
to silence Sailor Mars for all eternity, ensuring her best friend&#39;s 
existence in the future.

Sailor Mars desperately tried to evade the attack, willing her burning 
and liquid-like muscles to work faster but knowing her body was at its 
breaking point, and far too slow. She watched helplessly with gradually 
widening, alarmed, eyes as the Senshi of Death&#39;s curved blade came down 
at her through the ash filled air, the whole event seeming in slow 
motion. Sailor Mars had to hand it to Fate; sending Sailor Saturn out 
for her blood was a play she had never thought of, except perhaps only 
deep in her subconsciousness, the Fire Senshi remembering the instinct 
to lie to the pale young girl that had came over her outside the Tsukino 
residence. But, to the miko&#39;s pure horror, suddenly there was someone 
intercepting Death&#39;s strike, the protecting figure deflecting the 
silencing scythe with her own body in a valiant display of 
self-sacrifice. Sailor Moon howled in heart-wrenching agony as Sailor 
Saturn&#39;s Glaive tore into her right shoulder and travelled on to her 
upper arm, leaving a deep and gushing gash in its razor sharp path. The 
courageous blonde girl then collapsed to the ground, her life&#39;s blood 
spilling out all over the place in front of her stunned lover as she 
frantically clutched her appalling wound with her left hand, red fluid 
pumping out steadily between her fingers.

Sailor Mars could hear another tortured cry almost mirroring her 
princess&#146;s, but it was as if the sound was coming from far away in the 
distance, almost entirely muted. The Senshi of Fire&#39;s disbelieving gaze 
was fixed intensely on her true love as the angel writhed in anguish at 
the miko&#39;s feet, the top of the injured girl&#39;s once white fuku now 
nearly totally stained with crimson. Sailor Mars raised her head from 
the nightmarish sight to look at the origin of her princess&#39;s suffering, 
watching Sailor Saturn as the young girl alternated between staring 
dumbfounded at the struck down Sailor Moon and at her blood coated 
Silence Glaive. She tore off the remains of the bow on her Sailor Senshi 
fuku and wrapped the shredded material around her bloody and bruised 
fists, binding them tightly.

&quot;I...&quot; the Senshi of Rebirth choked out, shaking her head feebly in 
protest of the scene before her. She then looked at the object that had 
caused her such grief, and her features hardened. &quot;This happened because 
of you!!&quot; Saturn screamed at Mars, stabbing at the girl with a pointed 
finger. &quot;You made me hurt Chibi-Usa&#39;s mama! IT&#39;S ALL YOUR FAULT!!&quot;

The Senshi of Death let out a tormented howl and brought her Glaive down 
at Sailor Mars in an overhead swing, while a mix of the miko&#39;s and her 
lover&#39;s blood trailed in the air behind the blade, the incensed Saturn 
wishing to split the standing raven-haired girl in twain. However, just 
before the weapon could cave in the Inner Senshi&#39;s skull, something 
stopped it firmly in its tracks. Sailor Mars glowered at Sailor Saturn 
hatefully as she held the Outer Senshi&#39;s Silence Glaive in one strong, 
only minutely wavering hand, preventing the pole weapon&#39;s deadly blow 
from proceeding any further. Without warning, the Fire Senshi rammed her 
fist forwards, slamming the shaft of Saturn&#39;s own weapon hard into the 
girl&#39;s face. Sailor Mars was tired of being on the defensive, 
endeavouring to only avoid the deranged Outer Senshi&#39;s attacks rather 
than counter them with some of her own, not wanting to cause the young 
girl any harm. Because of the Senshi of Fire&#39;s inaction, her true love 
was now lying on the ground, bleeding, having taken a hit meant for her. 
The thought infuriated her, flowing new, blazing energy that felt like 
lava into her veins, and travelling on to refresh her sapped muscles.

Saturn reeled backwards as a small rivulet of red trickled out of her 
nose. The girl took a moment to shake her head and clear her addled 
mind, and then met Mars&#39; fiery, challenging, lavender stare with one of 
her own, frosty, violet ones. Their eyes were parallels to one another 
and yet... somehow similar. Sailor Mars was aware of the irony of it 
all; one Inner Senshi fighting for the princess of the present, and one 
Outer Senshi fighting for the princess of the future. Fire against 
Death, free will against Fate. And of course, neither girl would ever 
give up on either of their princess&#146;s.

Sailor Saturn abruptly rushed at Sailor Mars, swiping at neck height 
with her Silence Glaive, attempting to decapitate her adversary in one 
fell blow. The Senshi of Fire ducked swiftly and delivered a crushing 
punch into the Senshi of Death&#146;s exposed stomach, the burning in the 
miko&#39;s tight muscles not from exhaustion any longer. She heard Saturn 
expel a sharp breath of air from above her, and then the Outer Senshi 
chopped at her as she nimbly strafed to the side, the girl&#39;s lethal 
weapon slicing off a few tips of her long raven locks as the strands 
trailed behind. Sailor Saturn promptly whirled around as Sailor Mars 
moved, adding another cut on her nemeses&#146; torn up body, this one on her 
forearm. Sailor Mars barely felt it. The Inner Senshi stopped moving all 
of a sudden and lashed out brutally behind her with one leg at an 
unsuspecting Saturn. However, despite being taken by surprise, the pale 
girl, in a lightening quick manoeuvre, blocked the attack with the shaft 
of her Glaive, but was pushed slightly backwards by the power of the 
hit. Mars growled low in her throat and spun around to face her enemy. 
For such a frail looking thing, Sailor Saturn could certainly wield her 
weapon with substantial strength and dexterity.

Both combatants paused for a second, glaring at one another. Sailor 
Saturn twirled her Glaive in a lazy circle in her hands, wafting flakes 
of ash around to follow the ends of the spinning weapon. Sailor Mars 
merely stood watching the spectacle while she tightened the purple, and 
now bloodstained, makeshift bandages around her fists, not at all 
impressed. Without warning, the pair of senshi then bolted towards one 
another, both completely oblivious to the world around them, their minds 
entirely focused on the duel.

Sailor Saturn jabbed the butt of her Glaive into Sailor Mars&#39; 
midsection, jerking her opponent back briefly, and then fluidly brought 
the pole up to crack excruciatingly against the raven-haired girl&#39;s jaw. 
The Fire Senshi blocked with her forearm as Saturn followed up her move 
with a slash to the side, the rigid metal of the Silence Glaive jarring 
her bones. She countered the attack with a daring punch to the face, 
mashing her fist ruthlessly against the younger girl&#39;s features. Sailor 
Saturn reacted quickly, hooking the curved edge of her Glaive&#146;s blade 
around one of Sailor Mars&#39; legs and pulling on it, causing her assailant 
to stumble and also leaving a jagged scar of ragged flesh. The pale girl 
took advantage of the opening, and suddenly exploded into a whirlwind of 
destruction, swinging her Silence Glaive in a blurring display of skill, 
raining remorseless blow after remorseless blow against the miko. Sailor 
Mars moved like quicksilver, her lithe body dodging each strike, or 
using her forearms to deflect them, praying that her bones would hold up 
under the Senshi of Death&#39;s onslaught. But nevertheless, some blows 
broke through Mars&#146; defences, slicing open her fuku and body even more 
as Saturn forced her into slow but steady retreat.

Sailor Mars felt the chain link fence that surrounded Juuban High 
School&#39;s rooftop against her back as she blocked yet another powerful 
attack from Sailor Saturn, redirecting the hit to the left. Her arms 
were like lead weights, feeling sluggish to move under the Senshi of 
Death&#39;s constant cruel barrage. The Senshi of Fire had been pinned, 
defeated by a fellow Sailor of all opponents. Mars had idly considered 
sometimes who would win in a match up between herself and another 
senshi, but had never really taken such thoughts seriously; they were 
supposed to be her friends after all. But Saturn... the dark-haired girl 
surely was the most formidable, even without employing her world-ending 
abilities. Fate... that conniving force. It had certainly outdone itself 
with picking Sailor Saturn to use as its tool. Sailor Mars and the 
Senshi of Death fought with almost equal passion... Saturn must have 
cared a lot for Chibi-Usa to fight like this, more than the miko had 
realised.

Sailor Mars suddenly scowled in fierce determination, feeling the 
inferno of defiance build inside her as she recalled the sight of her 
only love being maliciously struck down, accident or not. Defeated? 
Sailor Mars? The Fire Senshi felt like laughing at such a ridiculous 
thought, wondering where such a pessimistic notion had came from. She 
was defeated *only* when she was dead. Fire against Death... how very 
amusing. Didn&#39;t Fate know Death couldn&#39;t touch her? Fire against 
Death... Death never stood a chance.

Sailor Mars moved in a flash, crouching under Sailor Saturn&#39;s latest 
strike against her, and then pounded both her fists into the Outer 
Senshi&#39;s mid drift, knocking the girl back a number of steps. The 
princess&#39;s bodyguard then sprung out of her crouch and into the air, 
before grappling onto the chain link fence behind her and kicking with 
all her might off it, directly at her nemesis. Sailor Mars delivered a 
punishing flying kick to the side of Sailor Saturn&#39;s head, the impact 
enough to nearly bring the Senshi of Death to her knees. The Fire Senshi 
landed and swiftly followed up her aerial manoeuvre with a spinning heel 
kick, crushing her foot against the other side of Saturn&#39;s dark-haired 
head. The young girl cried out a strangled scream as she was struck 
ruthlessly in succession, the unforgiving shots to the head dazing her. 
Sailor Mars didn&#39;t let up however, and thrust her right fist into Sailor 
Saturn&#39;s face, closely followed by her left, easily bypassing the Outer 
Senshi&#39;s now meagre defences and forcing the wobbling girl backwards 
into a retreat.

Sailor Saturn brought up her Silence Glaive and wildly swung out at 
Sailor Mars, frantically trying to disrupt her frenzy. But it was all 
for naught. The Senshi of Fire nimbly evaded the flailing bladed 
instrument and went on with her attack, orchestrating a devastating 
combination on Saturn&#39;s small body, beating the girl into submission and 
disarming her with sharp precision strikes to her wrists, causing the 
Silence Glaive fly out of her grasp and slide along the grey and black 
ash layered ground. Sailor Mars roared out triumphantly and preformed a 
crippling uppercut, sending a spray of crimson skyward as Sailor 
Saturn&#39;s head snapped back, a satisfying crunching noise filling the air 
as the Senshi of Death fell limply onto her backside.

Sailor Mars glared down ferociously at her princess&#39;s assailant with 
clenched teeth, and then clasped her hands together with the index 
fingers pointing straight at her vulnerable enemy.

&quot;FIRE--&quot;

&quot;NO, REI!!&quot;

The words to activate Mars&#39; finishing fireball were cut off by a loud 
and panicked shout in a familiar voice from her far left. Suddenly, 
images of a burnt and nearly strangled to death Sailor Venus flashed in 
her mind, freeing the miko from her enraged state and bringing the girl 
back to reality. She let her hands fall and dangle by her sides weakly, 
the impassioned fires inside her cooling to barely glowing embers as her 
abused body made its discomfort known. It had been so close. Sailor Mars 
looked down at the worn out Sailor Saturn as the young girl swayed where 
she sat. She had been about to incinerate her friend without a second 
thought, even pleased that she was burning the enemy who had hurt her 
princess. Gods, Mars had thought she had conquered the vicious side of 
herself already.

Sailor Mars heard a scraping sound of metal on gravel and raised her 
head, only to see Sailor Saturn had retrieved her Glaive and was 
preparing to once again swing it at her. Hadn&#39;t she had enough yet? 
Sailor Mars was exhausted! But before the Senshi of Death could follow 
through with her attack, an ebony cane suddenly stabbed down in the pole 
weapon&#39;s path, preventing its deadly journey towards Mars.

&quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen said sharply, glaring sternly at Sailor 
Saturn from behind his mask. The prince then shot an even sterner look 
at Sailor Mars. The Fire Senshi stared dauntlessly back. &quot;Both of you.&quot; 
The girl then noticed that the man&#39;s once white gloves were covered in 
blood.

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Mars gasped, remembering who had called out to her to cease her 
assault. She turned to where her princess had fallen and saw that Sailor 
Moon was still lying on the ground, but with her head resting on Tuxedo 
Kamen&#39;s rolled up cape. The Fire Senshi couldn&#39;t see Sailor Venus 
anywhere, or for that matter, any of the students and teachers from 
Juuban High School. She wondered how such a large group of people had 
managed to slip away without her being aware of it.

&quot;B-But she betrayed them!&quot; Sailor Saturn protested to Tuxedo Kamen, 
while pointing accusingly at Sailor Mars with her free hand. &quot;She 
betrayed Chibi-Usa and Setsuna-mama!!&quot; The Outer Senshi&#39;s eyes began 
welling up with unshed tears, not at all appearing like the incarnation 
of Death she had previous been. &quot;She betrayed you too! *You&#39;re* supposed 
to be Chibi-Usa&#39;s papa, not her! She *can&#39;t* be!&quot; Saturn wailed, and 
then burst into shuddering sobs, the tears now streaming down her black 
and blue cheeks as she wept her heart out.

&quot;I know... I know,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen said in an as comforting tone as he 
could after all that had happened, kneeling down next to the distraught 
young girl, his eyes narrowing behind his white mask as he saw that her 
nose was broken. &quot;But Chibi-Usa&#39;s mother needs you now. She&#39;s very badly 
hurt and needs your help. I know you&#39;re hurt too, but can you heal her?&quot; 
he asked compassionately, placing a gentle hand on the Outer Senshi&#39;s 
back.

Sailor Saturn nodded feebly and then sniffed, before whimpering and 
wincing in pain. &quot;My face hurts,&quot; she said in a small voice, before 
dragging her wounded body upright with careful help from Tuxedo Kamen. 
Despite having been mostly on the receiving end of the Senshi of Death 
and Rebirth&#39;s own attacks, Sailor Mars felt incredibly guilty.

Sailor Mars jogged ahead of Tuxedo Kamen and Sailor Saturn as best and 
as fast as she could to Sailor Moon&#39;s side, collapsing to her knees as 
they buckled beside her injured love. She quickly but gently took one of 
her princess&#39;s hands in her own as she gazed worriedly down at the girl.

&quot;It&#39;s not as bad as it looks,&quot; Sailor Moon assured her concerned lover 
with an only moderately noticeably grimace on her bloodless face as the 
raven-haired girl&#39;s frantic lavender eyes travelled over her wounded 
form, taking in the disturbing large red patch around her right 
shoulder.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have done that...&quot; Mars said softly, giving her 
princess&#39;s hand a light squeeze.

&quot;I guess you must be a bad influence on me,&quot; the wounded blonde said 
with a faint smile but in a slightly pained voice, gripping onto her 
bodyguard&#39;s hand tightly. &quot;Maybe next time you&#39;ll think twice about 
throwing yourself into danger, or else I just might follow your 
example.&quot; The girl then paused for a moment, her expression turning 
apprehensive, before continuing. &quot;Rei, I--&quot; Sailor Moon abruptly ceased 
talking as Tuxedo Kamen and Sailor Saturn approached, the prince 
supporting the Outer Senshi with one arm placed gingerly around her 
small waist.

The masked prince looked at Sailor Moon&#146;s and Sailor Mars&#146; clasped hands 
without expression while Sailor Saturn laid her own pair against the 
long gruesome gash along the blonde girl&#39;s right shoulder and upper arm, 
pouring the last vestiges of her energy into healing the injury that had 
been caused by her own hands in the first place. As Sailor Mars watched, 
the large Glaive wound slowly closed, the tattered flesh, muscle and 
skin re-knitting until there wasn&#39;t even a hint of a scar left, only 
dark red dried blood crusted about the area.

&quot;There,&quot; Saturn sighed tiredly, easing herself carefully backwards to 
sit on the ground. She fidgeted for a moment, and then looked timidly at 
Sailor Moon, some stray tears still rolling down her cut and bruised 
visage from her bloodshot violet eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Usagi,&quot; she said, 
deeply apologetic, appearing like she was about to burst into tears 
again. &quot;I really didn&#39;t mean to harm you, please believe me.&quot;

&quot;I know you didn&#39;t, Hotaru,&quot; Sailor Moon replied as she sat up 
carefully, flexing her right arm carefully, testing her newly healed 
limb. She then frowned sharply at Sailor Saturn, her features a mask of 
firm disapproval. &quot;But you intended to hurt Rei.&quot;

&quot;But... Chibi-Usa... a-and Setsuna-mama...&quot; Saturn argued softly, her 
lower lip quivering as she shot Mars a sour look.

Sailor Moon exhaled deeply, as if the weight of the entire celestial 
body that was her namesake were actually on her slender shoulders. 
&quot;Whatever your reasons, that&#39;s no excuse to attack your friends. And 
that goes for you too, Rei.&quot;

Sailor Mars blinked at her princess. &quot;But *I* was the one who was 
attacked! It was self-defence!&quot; she exclaimed indignantly. She had 
almost been killed for the gods&#146; sakes.

Sailor Moon gave her love a level look. &quot;True. But we both know you had 
other motivations to fight as well,&quot; she said in a matter-of-fact tone.

The Fire Senshi lowered her head, escaping her princess&#39;s stern blue 
gaze. &quot;You can&#39;t blame me for that...&quot; she muttered under her breath, 
glancing furtively at Sailor Moon out of the corner of one eye.

Sailor Moon&#146;s look softened marginally at her senshi&#39;s remark, and the 
miko felt the girl squeeze her hand again.

&quot;We should detransform and join Minako and the other survivors 
downstairs,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen harshly cut in, forestalling any further 
conversation between Sailor Moon and her personal bodyguard. &quot;Hotaru and 
I saw more police vehicles and ambulances heading this way when we 
arrived. I think I can hear their sirens down below. It would be best if 
we blend in with the other students and teachers and take advantage of 
the paramedics&#146; services.&quot; The prince gave the three Sailor Senshi a 
quick look over. &quot;All of you look like you need it,&quot; he added in a 
monotone.

&quot;Mamo--&quot; Sailor Moon began tentatively, all the previous confidence that 
had been shown when dressing down Mars and Saturn now vanishing from 
her.

&quot;Not now,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen said in almost a snarl, cutting off the 
princess&#39;s small, nervous voice. &quot;Later.&quot;

Sailor Moon nodded anxiously, seeming on the verge of tears herself, 
threatening to join the quietly sniffling Sailor Saturn in her weeping. 
Sailor Mars eyed Tuxedo Kamen coldly as he reached a hand down to the 
princess, inviting the blonde to take it and be helped to her feet. But 
before Sailor Moon could even entertain the notion, her senshi swiftly 
stood up --despite her body being in a depleted and tormented 
condition-- bringing her true love up with her, still holding the girl&#39;s 
hand securely. The prince narrowed his eyes at Sailor Mars and moved his 
proffered helping hand to Sailor Saturn, giving aid to the utterly 
exhausted and badly injured Outer Senshi instead, who readily excepted 
after looking bitterly at Sailor Moon&#146;s and the miko&#146;s clasped hands. 
Sailor Moon quickly extracted her hand from Sailor Mars&#39;, much to the 
raven-haired girl&#39;s surprise and disappointment. The Senshi of Fire 
wasn&#39;t really concerned however; she had expected her true love to be 
somewhat edgy, especially now that the prince knew about the blonde&#39;s 
close relationship with her best friend.

Sailor Mars detransformed as her comrades did the same and then gave one 
last look around Juuban High School&#39;s roof, taking in the abundant 
amount of bodies, all mostly human ones now that the youma cadavers had 
decayed away to nothing, apparently having a detrimental reaction to air 
in death like all the other types the miko had encountered before. So 
many innocent people dead... Rei was dreading the journey back down to 
the ground floor of the building, not wishing to relive the memories of 
seeing the results of so many people sadistically slaughtered. She 
spared a glance at Hotaru, but the young girl avoided her eyes. Fine. 
The miko hadn&#146;t meant to hurt the Outer Senshi so terribly, but Hotaru 
*had* initiated the duel-- Rei had a right to defend herself. She 
ignored the stray thought that said she had a right to punish all who 
harmed her divine angel as well.

But in the end, all of today&#39;s nightmarish events didn&#39;t truly matter. 
As promised, Usagi had informed Mamoru about Rei, and even if it weren&#39;t 
exactly the way the blonde or the miko had intended, the outcome would 
be the same. After Usagi had received medical attention, the girl was 
sure to have a long awaited conversation with her soon to be 
ex-boyfriend. Rei wondered whether the blonde would want her comforting 
presence when she talked to Mamoru or not. She had to admit; she did 
have a perverse desire to see the man&#39;s face when Usagi told him it was 
over between them, and that she wished to pursue a future with the Fire 
Senshi instead. So far Mamoru&#39;s reaction had been fairly impassive, but 
the miko could tell he was holding everything in... perhaps it would be 
better if Rei stayed by Usagi&#39;s after all; who knew how the prince would 
take the princess&#39;s rejection.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

I guess I might get some flames from Saturn fans for having her more or 
less lose the fight, but oh well. I figured I motivated Mars enough to 
whale on her anyway, and painted Saturn as a not too shabby fighter.</pre>
