<h1>The Return of Sailor V (part 12 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sailorjane.html">SailorJane</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/returnsailorv-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>THE BATTLE ON CHURCH STREET 

The position had been formed. On the sidewalk against the building, Sailor Mars and Sailor 
jupiter held their positions in front of Sailor Moon; Jupiter standing to Mars&#39; right. 
Certainly Sailor Jupiter was the muscle of the group, but Mars&#39; power of fire could hold 
back anyone. Standing to the right of Mars, protecting Sailor Moon from the side, was 
Sailor Venus. The brains of the group, Sailor Mercury, stood by Sailor Moon&#39;s right side. 
There was no way Mercury&#39;s computer could help her this time. Rather than some power 
wielding nega-monster with an energy source, the mob gathered on Church Street were only 
energized by their own greed. They had very little time before a few men pulled out their 
guns to fire at the scouts. Mercury acted quickly. 

&quot;Mercury Bubbles,&quot; the water scout called out, &quot;BLAST!&quot; 

The street was now filled with a misty fog making it impossible for the gang of low-lifes 
to see anything. Gun shots still fired, the girls all ducked hoping to avoid getting hit. 
Through the fog, Jupiter appeared before a gun-wielding killer and bashed him in the head. 
The man fell to the ground, his gun falling to the ground. 

The mob immediately charged after the scouts through the fog. It was impossible for them to 
see anything. Luckily, the fog didn&#39;t effect the sight of the Sailor soldiers. Jupiter&#39;s 
mixed-martial arts skills were more than a match for a group of possibly drugged-out 
criminals: A low Jujitsu kick to one man&#39;s leg, an immediate hard uppercut to another man&#39;s 
chin, a head-butt into a man&#39;s stomach, a titty-twister for another. Clearly she had the 
strength of a hundred men. 

The gunshots continued to fire, and Mars could see a bullet accidentally hitting one of the 
charging criminals. He fell to the floor as he screamed in agonizing pain. Raye hatted 
guns. She knew it was only a matter of time before a bullet got one of them. The shots 
needed to stop. It was to hard to see exactly where the bullets were coming from in this 
crowd, so Sailor Mars closed her eyes and pulled out one of her charms and brought it in 
front of her face. 

&quot;I call upon the power of Mars,&quot; she chanted and opened her eyes, &quot;Firearms begone!&quot; She 
threw the talisman into the air. No one had ever heard her shout this before. Though she 
had toasted hundreds of evil monsters, Raye was not about to burn these people alive. 
Scumbags thought they might have been, no human in her eyes deserved to die, especially in 
the presence of a memorial sight. 

Luckily, this non-lethal attack did it&#39;s job. The talisman burned into light. Sailor Mars 
could see through the dissipating fog, at least a few firearms being dropped to floor. 
Several men screamed and held their hands in pain. 

&quot;What was that?&quot; Sailor Moon asked her blue-haired consigliere. 

&quot;She overheated the metallic guns,&quot; Mercury responded. &quot;Nobody will be picking them up for 
a while.&quot; 

As the gunshots ceased, Sailor Mars jumped into the crowd and joined her brunette friend in 
the fight. She screamed in classic Japanese anime style as she brought several guys to the 
ground. Jupiter had the muscle, but Mars&#39; intensity could be just as damaging. Raye pulled 
out several charms and threw them onto the enemies foreheads. They cried in pain as Sailor 
Mars proceeded to kick them all to the ground. 

Jupiter and Mars continued to fend off the greedy criminals until one big guy got the drop 
on Mars. He pinned her to the ground and pulled out a large knife. The knife lunged for 
Sailor Mars&#39; eye. Jupiter had her hands full herself. 

&quot;Mars!&quot; Sailor Venus shouted running towards her. &quot;Venus Love Chain!&quot; She screamed and her 
trusted golden chain appeared before her. 

She immediately flung the metal chain into the man&#39;s knife-wielding hand. The knife flew 
out into the street. Mars immediately kneed the guy off of her as he let his guard down. 
More criminals tried to take down Mars, but Venus whipped her chain, holding them back like 
a lion tamer. 

&quot;C&#39;mon!&quot; Mina yelled with growl in her voice, &quot;Who wants some?&quot; 

It almost seemed as if some of the guys were getting turned on by this display of femdom. 

&quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; Mars said as she stood near her, &quot;They&#39;re looking at you like your a 
dominatrix!&quot; 

Mina looked to Raye and then growled in anger. &quot;Nobody fantasizes about me,&quot; She yelled as 
she charged after the criminals with her chain, &quot;Except Sailor Mars!&quot; The men ran away in 
pain as the chain hit them hard in the back. 

Sailor Moon watched her three soldiers fight for her life unsure what to do. Mercury stood 
near her protecting her in case anyone got past the three guardians. She still felt very 
weak. Serena saw Luna waiting near the side of the building. 

&quot;Any ideas Luna?&quot; She asked the cat. 

&quot;Sailor Moon,&quot; Luna looked to her, &quot;Get these people away from us and RUN!&quot; 

&quot;Run?&quot; Serena yelled, &quot;The first few years together, you told me to stay and fight, and now 
you want me to run?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s right Sailor Moon,&quot; Mercury said to her, &quot;The four of us can hold them off. You get 
out of here. They want you, not us.&quot; 

Everything raced before Sailor Moon&#39;s eyes. She had gone from the coldest corners of the 
Earth to the far reaches of space with her friends. Never once, despite all her fear, did 
she ever leave them behind. 

&quot;I&#39;m not gonna do that Mercury!&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;It&#39;s time to stop hiding!&quot; 

Luna was not sure whether to be proud of Sailor Moon&#39;s courage, or be disappointed by her 
stupidity. Either way, she encouraged her princess, &quot;Sailor Moon, the Imperium Silver 
Crystal should give you all strength to defeat this mob in a non-lethal manner.&quot; 

Sailor Moon had a confused look on her face, &quot;I thought it was called the Silver Imperium 
Crystal?&quot; 

&quot;WHATEVER!&quot; Luna snorted, &quot;Just use it!&quot; 

Serena rolled her eyes and held out her moon wand shouting, &quot;Moon Cosmic Power&quot;. She held 
the wand in the air as it glimmered brightly knocking several of the criminals to their 
backs and causing others to cover their eyes. There were still hundreds of villains waiting 
to tear them apart. 

Jupiter felt more strength in her body from the Silver Crystal. The mob continued after 
her, but punches and kicks sent them all piling on the ground. Sailor Mars knocked a man to 
his knees. She forcefully ripped open his shirt and pressed her hand against his chest. 
Fiery heat escaped from Mars&#39; gloved hand and branded a hand mark right on the man&#39;s chest. 
He screamed in pain running into the mob knocking several people over. 

Mercury stood like a new person and sighed with relief, &quot;I feel better. The crystal gave me 
back my strength.&quot; 

&quot;C&#39;mon Sailor Mercury,&quot; Sailor Moon said smiling, &quot;Let&#39;s do it!&quot; 

Mercury and Moon held hands and stared into each other&#39;s eyes for a second. &quot;Let&#39;s never 
separate again,&quot; Sailor Mercury said smiling. 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Sailor Mars shouted towards them, &quot;Are you two love-birds gonna help us or not?&quot; 

With their hands still held, Sailor Moon and Mercury extended their arms and ran towards 
the ground. They jumped together and kicked two bad guys at the same time. Now their hands 
separated. Mercury was not quite a fighter like Mars or Jupiter, but her desire to protect 
the princess was just as strong. She did a backflip towards a fat man with a bat. Her legs 
knocked the dangerous man to the ground. Sailor Moon was the weakest fighter, but her 
Crystal gave her enough power to fend off enemies. She was lucky that her four soldiers 
were doing a bulk of the fighting. 

Venus did a dance spin extending her chain out. As her body spinned around several times, 
her chain knocked several men to the ground. She stopped and spread her legs apart. As she 
smiled and admired her worked, she looked up to the building to see Sollozzo staring down 
at her. 

&quot;Is this all you got Sollozzo?&quot; She shouted at him with all her pride. 

Sailor Moon turned to the balcony. Sollozzo! They had to get rid of him. 

Sollozzo stood outside the broken window with an evil look in his eye. He rescinded back 
into his room slowly out of sight. 

&quot;Don&#39;t push him Venus,&quot; Jupiter shouted boxing with a man who looked like Mike Tyson (it 
might have even been Mike Tyson?) &quot;There&#39;s still a lot more villains here than we can 
handle.&quot; 

She was right, there was no break. They had already knocked out some 50 guys altogether, 
and the mob was still going strong. It was as if every evil-doer in New York City was right 
here on this street corner. 

&quot;I can&#39;t hold them off forever,&quot; Sailor Mars shouted. She watched another man try to pick 
up one of the guns she heated up. It was impossible, the pain from the burning metal was 
simply too much. 

&quot;Die Princess!&quot; A man&#39;s voice came through. He was a big man wielding a sword charging 
Sailor Moon. She watched him in terror. Sailor Mars instinctively reacted: 

&quot;Mars Fire Ignite!&quot; Fire escaped from her gloved hands and ignited the sword wielding man. 
He screamed in pain as his skin burned. 

Sailor Moon backed up unaware of what to do. Luckily Mercury did: 

&quot;Shine Aqua Illusion!&quot; Water escaped from her hands and distinguished the burning man. He 
fell to the ground, smoke escaping his body. His third degree burns looked painful, but he 
would live. &quot;Be careful Mars,&quot; Mercury called out, &quot;We don&#39;t wanna kill these people.&quot; 

&quot;Jupiter, Venus, cover me! Mercury get over here!&quot; Mars said as she ran towards Amy. 
Jupiter and Venus teamed up to give Raye cover as she met up with Mercury. Sailor Moon also 
covered the two. 

Raye had to speak up over the deafening crowd: &quot;I know we don&#39;t wanna kill anyone, but if I 
ignite a fire, you can just douse out the flames. Nobody burns to death, they&#39;ll all be on 
the ground in pain, we get the hell out of here.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know Mars,&quot; Mercury said, &quot;Third degree burns can kill people regardless of being 
treated with water. I&#39;m afraid to do it.&quot; 

&quot;But I&#39;m not,&quot; A loud voice came through. 

Suddenly a gigantic blast sent Mars, Mercury, the rest of the Sailor Scouts and everyone 
nearby flying from the ground. All five Sailor Scouts smashed right into the building. 
Luckily they were all still conscious. Several men had also fallen from the blast nearby 
them. They might not have been able to get up. 

Sailor Moon was still on the ground. She could still make out through the dusty air her 
Moon Wand five feet away from her. She crawled as quickly as she could on the dirty 
pavement till she could grab the instrument. Unfortunately, a black shoe came down on it. 
Sailor Moon looked up at a 9mm Pistol pointing towards her skull. The man holding the gun, 
his shoe on her moon wand, was the evil drug-dealer Sollozzo. 

All the other Sailor Scouts stood up to see several of Sollozzo&#39;s men wielding AK-47s. An 
angry Sailor Mars&#39; began to fill her fists with fire. Electricity illuminated from 
Jupiter&#39;s hands. 

&quot;Go ahead Sailor Scouts!&quot; Sollozzo shouted without taking his eyes off Sailor Moon. 

Sailor Venus calmed Mars down holding her as the gunmen smiled at her. Jupiter put her 
hands down to her sides and frowned. 

&quot;Sailor Moon!&quot; Mercury shouted seeing her Princess at gun-point. She wanted to run towards 
her, but Mina held onto her. 

&quot;Not another move out of any of you,&quot; Sollozzo said firmly, &quot;Or you will all die.&quot; 

Luna stood against the building wishing there was something she could do. 

The mob stood by not saying a word almost revering Sollozzo as a God. It was so eerily 
quiet. 

&quot;You know,&quot; Sollozzo smiled, &quot;I&#39;ve really gotta hand it to you Sailor Moon, you are a 
worthy adversary. I see now how you and your friends were able to take down Beryl, Tomoe, 
and everyone I worked with.&quot; 

Sailor Moon said nothing. 

&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Sollozzo&#39;s smile faded away, &quot;This will definitely be your last fight. 
You&#39;ve been a problem for the Negaverse and you&#39;ve been a problem for me for the last 
time.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t do it Sal,&quot; Venus cried to the man, &quot;I&#39;m the one who busted you up back in Tribeca. 
I&#39;ve played a hand in every Negaverse battle, take me!&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Raye shouted as she held onto her blonde girlfriend. The gunmen standing around them 
got closer to ensure no funny buiness, &quot;I&#39;m the one who took down everyone&#39;s guns, don&#39;t 
you want to ice me?&quot; 

&quot;You wanna take the muscle of the group-&quot; Jupiter interrupted. 

&quot;Please Sollozzo-&quot; Mercury interrupted. All four of the Sailor Scouts were talking over 
each other. 

&quot;Everybody shut up!&quot; Sollozzo said without looking at them. The Scouts fell silent. &quot;I&#39;ll 
figure out what to do with you all later. But right now, you are all going to watch Sailor 
Moon&#39;s head blow open.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s all right guys,&quot; Sailor Moon lied as she lied there thinking this was indeed the 
final final end. 

Sollozzo smiled and very slowly, his finger pressed on the trigger.
