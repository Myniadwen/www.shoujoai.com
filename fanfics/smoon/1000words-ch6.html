<h1>1000 Words (part 6 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/1000words-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The South of France, a truly beautiful place. Not a single cloud in the 
sky, warm weather, white beaches and gorgeous girls walking around in 
barely any clothes at all. If this wasn&#39;t Heaven, it was pretty damn 
close.

But it was barely a step up from Hell to Minako.

&#39;What&#39;s wrong with you, Aino? This is your dream vacation here. Not that 
you haven&#39;t had those before. You should be running around hitting on 
girls, not mourning a relationship long gone.&#39;

The start shifted, resting against a tree as she pulled her legs to her 
chest and hugged her knees. She gazed at the rolls of beautiful houses 
and felt a pang of sadness.

It was the only regret she had in life, breaking up with Rei. No, not 
even breaking up with her. Just leaving her, without an explanation... 
without a single word.

The weather that day was actually a lot like today. It had been the 
beginning of the peak of spring and the cherry blossoms were blooming 
beautifully. They were going to a cherry blossom festival, actually, and 
they&#39;d planned the perfect weekend together. It would be the two of them 
alone in a really long time, just her and her Rei.

&#39;Well, it didn&#39;t turn out very perfect, did it?&#39;

No, it didn&#39;t. She turned her back on the only person to love her, on 
that beautiful spring day. She turned from her life, her duty and her 
destiny.

&#39;It was your choice.&#39;

Yes, it was her own choice. She chose to walk this road, alone and 
without the people that meant the most to her. She chose to be a star 
and not a lover, to be selfish and forget everything else.

&#39;And yet you&#39;re back right where you&#39;re started.&#39;

Because life hadn&#39;t left her much of a choice, if she thought about it. 
It was inevitable, so why try to delay it? What was the point?

It was a little like love, actually. A confusing, twisted web of 
feelings and promises. To love was to place yourself entirely in 
another&#39;s hands, to place your trust, perhaps reluctantly, in them. IT 
was to give yourself.

But on the other hand, it was to receive the best gift of all: 
everything a person had to give. It was to be able to hurt that person 
deeply, because they allow you a side of them reserved only for you.

And you swear, to a god that you may not even believe in, that you&#39;ll 
never hurt her. Because you love her. Because it&#39;s the last thing you&#39;d 
ever want to do. Because you love them. But deep down, you know it&#39;s 
also for your own sake. You never want to give her a reason to hurt you, 
because you gave her the power to do so.

So, you swear and you promise. In a perfect love, you&#39;d both live 
happily ever after, find heaven in each other. But, for the same reason 
that the world wasn&#39;t perfect, love wasn&#39;t either. Why? Because humans 
are flawed. Tragically, inherently and undeniably flawed.

Despite loving her, despite needing her, despite wanting nothing more in 
the world than for her to be happy, despite promising both her and 
yourself you never would, you always end up hurting her.

Sometimes, it&#39;s by accident. A slip of the tongue or pure stupidity. 
Once in a while, you do it on purpose, because you can. Because it gives 
you a sense of power. And sometimes, sometimes you don&#39;t even know why 
you hurt her. It&#39;s not an impulse, not because you lack utter common 
sense. You just do it. Without reason and without explanation.

And sometimes, like for Minako, it&#39;s pure selfishness. It&#39;s not that you 
don&#39;t love her any less, but that you love yourself more. You have to 
make yourself happy, no matter how it might hurt her. You have to do 
what you do, because you find it more important than doing the right 
thing for her sake.

That&#39;s the worst thing to do to the one you love. It disregards all the 
promises you made, both those out loud and the ones in your heart of 
hearts. You love her, it means, but not enough. Not enough to remove 
yourself from the center of your universe.

And that means you&#39;re not ready for love. Not ready to love and be 
loved. That means while you thought you knew what you felt for her, that 
it was real, pure love, it wasn&#39;t. Because you hadn&#39;t given up enough of 
yourself, because you were afraid and you held back. Because you never 
actually gave up the self to her.

And it blew up in your face. Because you were scared, dead scared. So 
you hurt her. Hurt her like she promised she never would. Problem was, 
Minako still had no idea what she was so damn afraid of.


Jen stared out the window, sighing as she once again thought of her 
friends. They&#39;d been parted for only three days, but it felt like 
eternity. She missed flirting with Minako, joking around with Patrick, 
teasing Babs... hell, she even missed arguing with Mei.

They&#39;d become her family in the five years she&#39;s known them. It wasn&#39;t 
surprising, really. She spent more time with them than with anyone else. 
Flying from one country to the next, going from concert to concert, and 
living out of a suitcase for weeks at a time on tours. She saw the same 
four people day in and day out. But she didn&#39;t mind.

&quot;Am I interrupting?&quot;

The question, warm and polite, pulled the stylist from her thoughts. She 
turned to find Rei Hino at the door, a smile on her beautiful face. Her 
heart skipped a beat as she appreciatively raked her eyes over the curvy 
woman&#39;s form, finding her style a mix of sexy and professional, as 
usual.

&quot;No. To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?&quot;

The miko chuckled, enjoying the wolfish smile on the Aussie&#39;s face. She 
crossed her arms, tilting her head to the side, knowing fully well her 
hair would cascade like a raven waterfall. She was rewarded by a spark 
of lust in the green eyes that remained on her.

&quot;I have an offer I doubt you&#39;ll refuse.&quot;

Jen smirked, arching a brow as she crossed her arms. She raked her eyes 
over the Japanese woman&#39;s body again, painfully obvious this time, 
though she doubted the woman hadn&#39;t noticed before.

&quot;My, oh my. Why, Miss Hino, are you propositioning me?&quot;

The flicker in Rei&#39;s eyes told the stylist she knew that was the answer 
her statement would get and Jen felt her desire for the woman grow. She 
wasn&#39;t afraid. Good. It would make things so much more... enjoyable, for 
the both of them, she suspected.

&quot;If that&#39;s what you&#39;d like to consider it as, then yes. Otherwise, no. 
Or rather, not yet, at least.&quot;

The miko felt the familiar tingle of a good flirtation course through 
her body. She knew she would bed this woman eventually, there was no 
denying it. After all, neither party wanted it any other way. But the 
foreplay was one of the most important aspects of a good lay, second 
only, sometimes, to the act itself. Rei, however, had a feeling that in 
this case, the deed would be as enjoyable as the game they&#39;ll play.


Patrick winked at the bartender, the little pixie of a girl that blushed 
at the attention. The makeup artist gave her a charming smile before 
grabbing the drinks and heading back into the throng of dancers. The 
music pulsed in his veins, and he could feel his desire to lose himself 
build within him. He had to find the two that ordered the drinks and 
fast.

Mei smiled when she saw her friend approach. After all, how hard was it 
to miss six feet and a half of broad shouldered, well-muscled specimen 
of a man. He towered over the rest of the patrons of the club and so 
easily picked his way to their table.

&quot;Here you go.&quot;

Mei thanked him with a peck on the cheek as he sat down on the stool. 
She watched as he scanned the club, looking for someone to catch his 
eye. So far, the night had been disappointing.

The Chinese girl was downright bored. With Jen in Japan and Minako 
cooped up in her room, that left only her and Pat to roam the night 
since Babs would never set foot in a place like this. Something the hair 
stylist hated. The agent had to lighten up once in a while: she was 30 
going on 300 for god&#39;s sakes.

All right, so Babs had a lot more responsibilities than they did. But 
that didn&#39;t mean they couldn&#39;t have fun once in a while, right? Right.

&quot;That blonde&#39;s been eying you the entire night.&quot;

Mei snapped out of her thoughts and followed her friend&#39;s gaze. She 
smiled when her eyes settled on a slender young man with shaggy hair 
that fell into his eyes. It was too far to tell what color, but she 
hoped it was grey. She had a love for steel colored eyes, after all.

&quot;Wonder when he&#39;ll work up the courage to come over and ask you to 
dance.&quot;

Patrick watched with affection as the Chinese girl&#39;s eyes lit up with 
excitement. He knew she&#39;d been dying to get out of the hotel and spend 
the night out on the town since lately, the word &quot;fun&quot; could not be 
associated with their blonde boss. She&#39;d been sulking and brooding ever 
since they got to France, much to their confusion.

&quot;Maybe we need to show him what he&#39;s missing.&quot;

A shiver went down the makeup artist&#39;s spine when he heard her 
mischievous half-purr. While he thought of all of the girls like his 
little sister, he&#39;d be dead to deny that they were all very attractive.

Mei slid off her stool with grace she didn&#39;t appear to have and took 
Patrick&#39;s hand in hers, leading him toward the mass of bodies swaying as 
one on the dance floor. She let the music take over, feeling it in her 
bones as Patrick stuck close to her, using his body to shield her from 
errant elbows and hands.

The African American male felt his eyes trail down Mei&#39;s swaying form 
despite himself. At barely five feet, his friend was the embodiment of 
the petite Asian woman. With her jet black hair, doe-like brown eyes and 
subtle curves, she was the &quot;exotic&quot; Asian woman every man wanted. Add 
her infectious smile and charming innocence and you had an irresistible 
package.

Too bad most men mistake her cheerful exterior for low intelligence and 
her excitement for naivety. Mei knew how to play the game like a pro and 
loved to use her charms to lure unsuspecting men to their downfall.

His arm wrapped around her waist and pulled her close once she found a 
spot she liked. In the dark club, few people paid any attention to them 
as they danced. A subtle look in the direction of the shaggy blonde, 
however, told Mei that she had the attention of the one she wanted, and 
that was enough.

She loved being in Pat&#39;s arms. He made her feel safe and protected, even 
cherished. Only not the way she longed to be. It was a sort of familial 
love and affection with which he held her, and as much as she treasured 
that, she longed to be wanted by someone in love with her.

It wasn&#39;t failure of searching on her part. Time after time, she 
ventured into the clubs and bars of the many cities she&#39;s traveled to in 
search of that one person for her. And time after time, she&#39;d been 
disappointed.

Patrick carefully eyed the progress of the blonde Mei was hunting as he 
made his way toward them. His brotherly instinct flared up and he took 
in the details of his boy trying to dance with his Mei.

He wasn&#39;t bad look, just kind of scruffy. Not the type of guy he thought 
would suit his long time friend in the long run, but good enough for a 
temporary kind of thing. He noticed as he approached that he wasn&#39;t as 
much handsome as he was... well, pretty. His grey eyes stayed on Mei as 
he approached, now just out of arms&#39; reached.

&quot;May I cut in?&quot;

Patrick relinquished his hold at the question, giving the boy a hard 
look to warn him about messing with Mei. The hairstylist herself just 
smiled and patted his stomach with a small hand and gave him that sweet 
smile of hers. As the lanky boy took the Asian woman into his arms, the 
makeup artist realized that what he originally thought dark tawny hair 
was actually red.

His lips twitched upwards in a smile before his brows furrowed and he 
headed off the dance floor. Red hair and grey eyes, pretty body, slender 
and tall. God, Mei, when were you going to open your eyes and realize 
who you&#39;ve been looking for?

Pat made his way back to the bar, disappointed to see an older man 
serving the drinks. He ordered a beer and ran a large hand over his 
cleanly shaved head.

He&#39;s known Mei for ten years now. They&#39;d grown up in the suburbs of LA 
together. He knew her tastes and feelings better than she did half the 
time. And he hated the realization that his insight offered him his 
time.

Taking a deep swig of his beer, he turned his attention back to the 
small woman dancing with that gangly boy. Come on, Mei, red hair and 
grey eyes. How many people do you know that looked like that? He&#39;d bet 
his next paycheck that he had freckles too.

Now, if only he could get her to see what he saw.


Jen followed Rei quietly, occasionally sneaking a glance or two at the 
imposing woman beside her. The publicist was a true masterpiece of 
genetics. Beautiful, smart and charming in a rough yet seductive kind of 
way, she was the kind of woman that the stylist has been searching for.

The fact that the interest wasn&#39;t a one way thing helped. She&#39;d been 
coming to the office for the past three days, since she honestly had 
nothing better to do after waking up mid-afternoon everyday. And every 
single day, she&#39;s seen the gorgeous woman. And every day, they&#39;ve 
flirted like nobody&#39;s business.

&#39;Is this just a chance for her to practice her charms on someone, or is 
she really lusting after me like I think she is?&#39;

As if Rei knew what Jen was thinking, she turned her head ever so 
slightly and get her eyes meet the stylist&#39;s startled green orbs. With a 
smile that hinted at her perfect, white teeth, she caused a shiver to 
race down the other woman&#39;s spine.

The publicist knew exactly what she was doing, and she loved it. It 
wasn&#39;t often that she felt this comfortable with a woman and let herself 
flirt like crazy, and she basked in the experience. Rei&#39;s always been 
disgusted by those that flaunted their power, but she&#39;d learn the thrill 
of it in the past few years. That didn&#39;t mean she went out charming 
everyone she met to get something, but it did mean that she was now very 
aware of what she did to those people that found her beautiful.

She knew pursuing something with Jen wasn&#39;t smart. After all, she was 
currently an employee of Athena, although it was just a way to get 
Minako free of her contract with Siren. But she was on the company 
payroll, nonetheless. Plus, this woman worked for her ex, the woman that 
had broken her heart. She was playing with a fire that she knew could 
burn hotter than her own when tempted.

Lavender eyes took in the woman beside her and Rei felt her resolve 
crumble. Jen was a very attractive woman, rebellious and wild, a bit of 
a wolf too, it seems. Taking a chance with such a woman would leave Rei 
with no regrets, that much she knew. The only question was when would be 
a good time?

&quot;So, are you going to tell me where we&#39;re going?&quot;

Rei just smiled, her eyes twinkling faintly.

&quot;Impatient, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

Jen snorted and crossed her arms, giving the other woman a look.

&quot;No,&quot; she said dryly, &quot;I&#39;m just a girl that likes to know where she&#39;s 
going. That so wrong?&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; the publicist said, as if all the world&#39;s secrets had been 
revealed to her. &quot;A control freak then.&quot;

The stylist let out a short bark of laughter. She stopped and turned 
toward the other woman, satisfied when Rei stopped and turned to face 
her as well.

&quot;You&#39;re too much, Hino.&quot;

The Asian woman&#39;s eyes grew dark as tendrils of grief and guilt haunted 
her eyes. She turned on her heel abruptly and resumed her walk.

&quot;Some would say I&#39;m not enough.&quot;

The sudden change of mood confused Jen, and she raced to catch up. As 
she fell in step with the publicist, she allowed her eyes to take in the 
strong profile. That moment of weakness had been completely unexpected 
and rather than acting as a turn off, it only strengthened the Aussie&#39;s 
resolve to get to know this mysterious woman.

&quot;So... you&#39;re not even going to give me a hint?&quot;

&quot;Stubborn, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I prefer to think of myself as persistent.&quot;

Rei smiled and shook her head. She paused again, inspecting the other 
woman with a critical and somewhat entertained gaze.

&quot;You&#39;re going to do what your contract said you&#39;d do.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Jen said, suddenly getting a sinking feeling in her chest. She 
knew she should&#39;ve listened to Babs when she explained the contract.

&quot;You&#39;re going to be a stylist.&quot;

The Australian-native blinked a few times, trying to understand what Rei 
was saying.

&quot;I&#39;m going to be a stylist?&quot;

The publicist nodded, enjoying the confused expression on the tough 
woman&#39;s face. It made her look younger and more innocent, much to Rei&#39;s 
amusement.

&quot;You&#39;re going to design the look for one of our new artists.&quot;

Watching the excitement light up Jen&#39;s green eyes made her companion 
smile. All right, so maybe controlling her lust and attraction for the 
foreigner will be harder than Rei had thought it&#39;d be. But she&#39;ll 
triumph in the end, she always did...

&quot;Really?&quot;

Unable to hide her amusement any longer, Rei chuckled and nodded. Jen 
grinned widely.

&quot;Ready to meet your canvas?&quot;

The stylist knew the woman with her was in a good mood. Taking 
advantage, she placed her hand on the silk-covered arm, smiling.

&quot;Lead the way.&quot;


Minako knew the actress she was having dinner with was trying 
desperately to charm her. It wasn&#39;t working, seeing as how other than 
being beautiful, the woman had nothing going for her. But the singer was 
glad for the distraction, nonetheless. A good-looking companion always 
kept her libido in overdrive.

&quot;So then Ralph demanded that I wear his dress. I had no problem with it, 
of course, seeing as how the one he picked out for me was simply 
gorgeous...&quot;

The blonde smiled and nodded, having learned long ago exactly how often 
she should give some sort of a sign to pretend that she was paying 
attention. Most people with half a brain cell to rub together could tell 
when she was just pretending. But once again, the woman with her tonight 
wasn&#39;t all that bright.

&quot;Alice, what do you say we go somewhere else?&quot;

The brunette stopped mid-sentence, a sexy smile slowly working her way 
across her lips. Minako returned the favor, hooding her blue eyes with 
her long lashes. There was one thing that all stars understood and 
wanted. Besides, the singer&#39;s always wanted a taste of the French.

&quot;But of course. Let me just get the check...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Minako said, placing a hand over the actress&#39; and giving her one 
of her dazzling smiles. &quot;Allow me.&quot;

Alice smiled gratefully, her green eyes taking in her companion&#39;s form 
as she signaled the waiter. Once the check had been paid, the women 
slipped out of the restaurant and into the waiting limo.

&quot;Where shall we go?&quot; Minako asked, drawing a circle on Alice&#39;s knee.

&quot;My apartment?&quot; the actress asked, feeling her desire for the beautiful 
woman with her grow.

&quot;You heard the lady.&quot;

The driver said nothing and pulled away from the curb, raising the 
screen between the back and front. The last thing he saw in the mirror 
was Minako widening her smile into a roguish grin and leaning forward. 
As he headed for Alice&#39;s apartment, he turned his radio on just a hint 
in an attempt to keep his mind off the moans and panting he heard.


All right, it&#39;s been a ridiculous amount of time since I last updated. 
I&#39;m sorry.

This chapter&#39;s a filler, just to hint at a couple of relationships 
that&#39;ll develop as the story goes on. Sorry about that.

Hope you enjoyed it, nonetheless. Thanks for reading.</pre>
