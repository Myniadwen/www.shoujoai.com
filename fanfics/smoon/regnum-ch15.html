Mamoru caught Usagi looking at the clock again.  Leaning over, he 
whispered, &quot;Usako, the baby is fine.  Your mother would call if 
there were any problems.  We&#39;ll head home when we need to, but 
for now, please try to enjoy yourself and stop fretting!&quot;  

Usagi flashed a wry smile at her husband.  &quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; she 
promised.  

Though it had been almost 7 months since Chibi-Usa&#39;s birth, 
Haruka and Michiru&#39;s dinner party marked the first occasion that 
Usagi and Mamoru had gone out together without their baby.  It 
also represented the first time all of the senshi had gathered 
together for something other than a wedding or funeral in far too 
long.  Usagi, though having a wonderful time, couldn&#39;t help but 
worry that something was going wrong back home.  What if Chibi-
Usa was crying incessantly?  She tended to do that.  Would her 
mother call and let her know, or would she stoically try to 
withstand the gale force screams of her beloved granddaughter?  

Of course, deep down, Usagi also wondered what it meant if Chibi-
Usa was not crying.  Did her little baby not need her as much any 
more?  Her eyes drifted inexorably once again toward the clock on 
the wall.  Suddenly, a dinner roll nailed her right between the 
eyes.

&quot;Stop looking at the clock, meatball head!&quot; Rei yelled from 
across the room, another freshly-baked projectile resting 
dangerously in her hand.  &quot;Your precious little yam-head-to-be is 
just fine!&quot;  

Mamoru had gained enough wisdom over the years to stifle the urge 
to whisper &quot;I told you so.&quot;  

Glancing sheepishly at all of her friends, Usagi gave them all a 
wink and wailed, &quot;Rei-chaaannnnn, why are you always so mean to 
me!!!  Mina-chan!  Have you been holding out on her?  Rei-chan 
always gets extra cranky when she&#39;s not getting any loving!&quot;

As Mina and Rei stammered incoherent denials, blushing furiously, 
the rest of the women broke out into raucous laughter.  Seeing 
the sweat forming on their foreheads, Usagi felt slightly guilty 
for embarrassing them, so she decided to fix it the only way she 
knew how.  

&quot;Watch it, meatball-head, you almost made me spill my drink,&quot; Rei 
scolded, though she was unable to hide a joyous smile, as she and 
Mina tried to squirm out from under Usagi&#39;s patented tackle-hug.  
With one shared look, she and Mina changed tactics, grabbing 
pillows and simultaneously bonking Usagi over the head with them.  

&quot;Ami-chan!  Mako-chan!  Your princess needs you!  They&#39;re ganging 
up on me!&quot; Usagi yelled, trying unsuccessfully to dodge their 
relentless pillowistic assault.  
Ami glanced at Makoto.  Makoto glanced at Ami.  Both nodded.  

Moments later, Usagi found herself being pummeled by four 
pillows!  The feathery carnage continued until, suddenly, a 
guitar chord rang throughout the room and a folded-up red napkin 
flew through the air, landing in front of the roiling mass of 
inner senshi.

&quot;Pillows are meant to provide comfort and respite for weary 
heads.  They bring joy and happiness to all who enjoy their 
cushiony goodness.  You have turned these pillows into 
instruments of violence and aggression.  For this, there can be 
only one response.&quot;  

Mamoru rose from his seat, standing menacingly over the five 
young women scattered in a heap on the sofa and floor.  The young 
women in question hid their faces behind their hands using the 
techniques learned through years of fighting by the side of 
Tuxedo Kamen to suppress the laughter that his inane speeches 
inspired.  Before he could make good on his threats, though, he 
fell back onto his chair under a pile of five pillows, the 
largest hurled by Usagi herself.

&quot;Do we all need a time-out, children?&quot; Haruka announced from the 
doorway.  &quot;We step into the kitchen for five minutes to check on 
things and a riot breaks out?&quot;  As she turned to Michiru to share 
a witty jibe at the inners&#39; expense, she felt something soft thud 
against the back of her head.  &quot;Ok, who threw that!&quot; she 
demanded, spinning around to find five amused young women 
returning her stare with innocent smiles .  

Michiru giggled happily, reaching out to sooth her irritated 
companion with a gentle caress on the arm.  &quot;Dinner is ready, if 
you&#39;re done with the festivities,&quot; she announced to the room.  As 
Haruka tried to pick up a pillow nonchalantly, Michiru added, &quot;I 
wouldn&#39;t even dream of doing that if I were you, &#39;Ruka.  Don&#39;t 
start something you know you won&#39;t be able to finish.&quot;  

&quot;What?  I was just stretching,&quot; Haruka lied, even as she jerked 
her hand away from the pillow in question.  &quot;What&#39;s everyone 
waiting for?&quot; she asked, darting into the dining room. 

As everyone collected themselves and headed in to dinner, Mako 
whispered playfully in Ami&#39;s ear, &quot;If you think you&#39;re going to 
have me as whipped as Michiru has Haruka, you&#39;d better think 
again!&quot;  

Ami smiled devilishly, not even turning to face Makoto as she 
replied quietly, &quot;If you think I don&#39;t already, you&#39;d better 
think again.  We water senshi have a lot more in common than 
being good swimmers, Mako-love.&quot;  

Makoto grinned happily as Ami took her hand and led her to the 
table.    

-------------

Dinner proceeded more sedately, despite the barbs and jibes that 
characterize conversations among close friends.  Though everyone 
had been keeping in touch more or less, each person spent some 
time bringing everyone up to date on their lives.  

Mamoru and Usagi tried to limit their parenthood stories, 
conscious of the fact that things that seem fascinating to new 
parents are often quite boring to non-parents.  Thus, discussions 
of the consistency and frequency of Chibi-Usa&#39;s poops were left 
on the back burner.  

Haruka and Michiru described their latest trips.  Haruka no 
longer raced full-time on the circuit, but still participated in 
various events when invited to do so by sponsors seeking to spice 
up the field.  Similarly, Michiru&#39;s touring days were behind her 
as she limited herself to charity functions and filling in for 
old friends when necessary.  Though they did not yet think it 
appropriate to discuss it, both knew that their days on Earth 
were increasingly numbered.  Their duty called and soon they 
would depart.  They wanted to enjoy as much of their home as they 
could before heading to the outer reaches.  

Setsuna entertained everyone with humorous stories about the 
undergraduate and graduate students in her physics seminars.  For 
some reason, they all sought her out for advice, not only about 
their work, but also about their tumultuous personal lives.  &quot;You 
just radiate this aura of &#39;all-knowing seer&#39;,&quot; Minako pointed 
out.  &quot;Maybe because she is an all-knowing seer,&quot; Haruka joked.  
Setsuna also filled in the gaps in Hotaru&#39;s accounting of her 
schoolwork and various activities, making sure the young girl got 
full credit from everyone for her exemplary grades and excellent 
performances in dance and soccer.  

Despite her international celebrity status, Minako had little to 
say.  The fact that most of her activities were covered in the 
various newspapers around town made it somewhat redundant for her 
to describe her doings.  She hoped to have her new CD ready to 
release in conjunction with a planned summer tour of Japan and 
Korea.  

Makoto was still searching for a suitable location to open her 
own cafe.  Aside from keeping her and Ami&#39;s apartment clean and 
cooking their meals, she spent a great deal of time in a local 
greenhouse, playing with various orchid and rose hybrids.  
Despite the well-known fact that no one had ever bred a blue 
rose, she had sworn to keep trying.  Ami dropped her eyes, 
embarrassed at the happy sighs from her friends, who all realized 
exactly why Makoto wanted to do such a thing, and for whom.  

Eventually, the conversation turned to Rei and Ami, though 
everyone had left them for last by unspoken consent.  Their 
particular jobs hit very close to home, especially now that Ikuko 
had begun to grow increasingly frail.  Rei tried to present a 
very upbeat picture of the work of her committee, emphasizing the 
large sums of money that had been donated and the unprecedented 
degree of international cooperation taking place.  Unfortunately, 
Ami could not offer as upbeat an assessment of her own area of 
work.

&quot;Are the researchers making any progress at all?&quot; Michiru asked 
her.  

Ami sighed, &quot;No, not really.  The effects are somewhat similar to 
advanced cases of radiation sickness, but none of the patients 
has been exposed to those levels of radiation.  My mother has 
been coordinating a lot of the independent studies.  She says 
that none of the tests done to date show anything conclusive as 
to the cause.&quot;  

&quot;Radiation? I wonder...&quot; Setsuna said. &quot;Sometime ago, Artemis 
mentioned that they&#39;d been getting some strange readings from the 
sun.  Might there be a connection?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not aware of anything strange.  There has been a slight rise 
in solar flare activity, but studies of the energy released by 
those flares have shown nothing potentially harmful,&quot; Ami 
informed them.  

Makoto chuckled grimly, &quot;I guess we can&#39;t expect two cats to 
detect something that the world astronomical community can&#39;t.&quot;

Suddenly, Ami&#39;s eyes went wide.  &quot;Wait.  Mako-love, you may have 
just hit on something.  Maybe they can detect something that we 
can&#39;t.&quot;  Without further explanation, Ami transformed, to the 
amazement of her friends.  As Sailor Mercury, she activated her 
VR goggles and pulled out her portable computer. Moving to the 
window, she looked up at the sky.  No one spoke, not wanting to 
disturb whatever it was that she was doing.  Finally, she 
muttered, &quot;It&#39;s too faint.  I need better equipment.&quot;

&quot;Ami-chan, what are you doing?&quot; Rei prodded.  

Ami turned back to her friends, shifting wordlessly back into her 
normal form.  &quot;Well, when Setsuna mentioned Artemis and Luna, it 
occurred to me that any observations they would be making would 
be related to negative energy, like that used by our enemies.  
That kind of energy would not be detectable to modern instruments 
because it has a magical component.&quot;

&quot;Actually, some of the &#39;wilder&#39; quantum physicists out there have 
described new kinds of energy and particles that one could 
interpret as having similar behaviors to what we call negative 
energy,&quot; Setsuna offered.  

Ami nodded, &quot;Yes, but none of those are easily detected. We, 
however, have all sorts of ways to detect spikes of negative 
energy.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t see anything unusual just now.&quot;  
Seeing her friends&#39; excitement turning to dejection, Ami quickly 
added, &quot;But, that might be because my instruments aren&#39;t designed 
to detect trace amounts, only large bursts.  I&#39;ll need to do more 
research!&quot;

&quot;Sounds expensive,&quot; Haruka grunted. &quot;I know Rei&#39;s committee is 
rather well-funded, but I doubt they&#39;d be willing to pay for 
research along these lines, and that kind of research isn&#39;t 
cheap.  I remember seeing some of the class budgets for the 
advanced sciences at Mugen and they were rather pricey.&quot; She 
paused and looked over at Michiru.  With a glance, they reached a 
decision.

&quot;Fortunately, both Haruka and I have been blessed by some 
generous patrons and have invested our money well,&quot; Michiru 
announced.  &quot;We&#39;d be happy to contribute whatever you need, Ami-
chan.&quot;

&quot;Me too!&quot; Minako chipped in.  &quot;Heck, I just headlined a benefit 
concert for this illness, the least I could do is chip in my own 
funds.&quot;

Ami bowed her head shyly.  &quot;You are all very generous, but it is 
just the beginnings of an idea.  I don&#39;t even know enough yet to 
decide if it makes sense to continue.  I&#39;ll have to consult with 
Luna and Artemis.  Where are they anyway?&quot;

Michiru chuckled, &quot;They&#39;re sleeping, as usual.  I think they get 
bored watching us all eat, since they&#39;re stuck with cat food all 
the time.  They asked me to wake them when we finished dinner.&quot;

&quot;Ami, how are you going to have time for all of this?  You&#39;re 
already working sixty hour weeks with your mom,&quot; Makoto pointed 
out gently.  &quot;You can&#39;t push yourself so hard.&quot;  

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, Mako,&quot; Ami replied excitedly.  &quot;I&#39;m going to go 
talk to them right now!&quot;  Excusing herself, she placed her napkin 
on her chair and hustled off to find the sleeping cats.  

After a few moments of silence, Minako tentatively asked, &quot;Mako-
chan, how long has Ami been able to transform without her wand?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Makoto replied, &quot;she told me that when she saved those 
kids on the sailboat in San Francisco she transformed without 
it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve always been able to transform without a pen,&quot; Mamoru 
declared.  Usagi kicked him under the table and everyone else 
ignored him.

&quot;Luna always said we&#39;d be able to do that one day,&quot; Rei recalled. 
&quot;I&#39;ve never tried it, though.&quot;   The others all nodded in 
agreement.  

Finally, Haruka rose from the table. &quot;No time like the present,&quot; 
she said.  After focusing her energy briefly, she looked to the 
sky and shouted, &quot;Uranus Planet Power Make-Up!&quot;  Suddenly, the 
air began to crackle and swirl and everyone could feel the 
familiar energies of transformation.  As the bright light died 
down, everyone could see Sailor Uranus standing before them, a 
proud, happy grin on her face.  

Of course, everyone else had to try it.  Within moments, all of 
the Sailor Senshi stood around Haruka and Michiru&#39;s dining room 
table, accompanied by Tuxedo Kamen. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?  Is there a threat?!&quot; Sailor Mercury shouted as 
she dashed back into the dining room, Luna and Artemis hot on her 
heels.  &quot;I could sense all of you transforming from the next 
room!&quot;

After the embarrassed laughter died down, Makoto explained it all 
to her and everyone resumed their normal forms.  &quot;Come on, Ami,&quot; 
Makoto urged, &quot;at least finish your meal before you begin your 
research.&quot;  As Ami sat down to eat, Makoto whispered, &quot;You were 
the first of us to do that, love.  I&#39;m very proud of you.&quot;  With 
a light kiss on Ami&#39;s ear, Mako returned to her own meal.  

---------------------------------

&quot;Ami-love, are you ever going to come to bed?&quot; Makoto asked from 
a darkened doorway, idly scratching a patch of dry skin on her 
arm.  Over the last few months, she&#39;d reluctantly grown used to 
going to sleep by herself.  Usually, Ami would stay with her in 
bed for a while, but then excuse herself to continue with her 
work.  Some nights, Makoto slept right through till morning.  
Most nights, like this one, she tossed and turned and then 
retrieved Ami herself.  

&quot;In a few minutes,&quot; Ami called over her shoulder.  She sat at her 
workbench, hunched over beneath the stark light of a lone desk 
lamp.  On the desk in front of her, her mini-computer sat with 
most of its inner workings exposed as Ami made minute adjustments 
with delicate instruments.  

Makoto sighed heavily.  &#39;A few minutes&#39; usually translated to an 
hour at least.  Glancing at the wall clock, she noted that it was 
close to 3 am.  She moved slowly into the room and knelt down at 
Ami&#39;s side, waiting for her to finish whatever she was doing.  
Eventually, Ami pushed back from the desk and met Makoto&#39;s 
patient gaze.  &quot;Darling,&quot; Makoto said, &quot;it is almost three.  I 
know that you&#39;re going to insist on getting to the lab right on 
time in the morning.  If you don&#39;t come to bed now, you&#39;ll get 
less than four hours of sleep, and you yourself told me that 
missing that much sleep is bad for your health.&quot;  

Ami reached out and gently caressed Makoto&#39;s hair.  &quot;I know, 
love.  You&#39;re good to remind me.  I lose track of time when I get 
caught up in what I&#39;m doing.  Just let me make this final 
adjustment.  Then, I promise I&#39;ll come right to bed.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Makoto grunted, rising to her feet.  &quot;I&#39;m going to stay 
here and watch though, to make sure you don&#39;t &#39;lose track of 
time&#39; again.&quot;  

With a happy giggle, Ami leaned forward to kiss Makoto&#39;s hand 
where it rested at her hip.  &quot;I promise!&quot;  With that, she put on 
her jeweler&#39;s glass and went back to work on the computer.  True 
to her word, in only a few moments, she began to reassemble the 
casing.  &quot;There,&quot; she announced, &quot;we&#39;ll give this a try in the 
morning when the sun comes up.&quot;  
&quot;Which should be any minute now,&quot; Makoto noted wryly.  With a big 
yawn, she took Ami by the hand led her to bed.  

--

&quot;Wake up, Mako!  Wake up!&quot;

It took Makoto a moment to get her bearings.  She was in bed, it 
was apparently morning, and Ami was shaking her shoulders quite 
vigorously.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked, sitting up quickly.

&quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong... well, something is wrong, but now I know 
what!&quot;  Ami shouted.  &quot;Come on, let me show you!&quot;  With that, she 
darted out of their bedroom.  

Sliding slowly out of bed, Makoto paused to pull on her old green 
terrycloth bathrobe before following Ami out into the living 
room.  Though it was a bit frayed around the edges, Makoto had 
had the robe since she was a teenager and couldn&#39;t imagine 
parting with it, despite the occasional jibe from her lover.  In 
the other room, there was no sign of Ami.   Mako looked about in 
hazy confusion, wiping the sleep from her eyes, until she noticed 
the sliding glass door partly open.  Pulling the robe more 
tightly around herself, she stepped out onto the balcony.  There 
Ami stood, staring almost directly into the sun through her 
Sailor Mercury goggles, tapping furiously at her mini-computer.  

&quot;Look at this!&quot; Ami insisted, sliding the goggles off of her head 
and proffering them to Makoto. 

Makoto slid them on.  Ami had let her try the goggles a few times 
in the past, so she expected to see the usual tactical readouts 
and thermal scans.  Instead, she saw a faint black light 
glistening throughout the display.   Upon Ami&#39;s suggestion to 
look up, she turned her attention to the sky.  The darkness 
seemed to grow stronger as she did so, coalescing into an almost 
solid orb.  Taking the goggles off, she quickly had to shield her 
eyes, as she was staring straight into the sun.  

&quot;What does it mean, Ami?&quot; Makoto asked with a shiver.  It was 
cold on the deck, but the shiver arose from a rising sense of 
foreboding.  

&quot;It&#39;s just as I&#39;ve suspected. Come inside and I&#39;ll explain it.  
We have to gather everyone together!&quot; Ami declared.

---------

&quot;And that&#39;s my theory,&quot; Ami concluded, looking around the room.  
It had taken only a few phone calls and less than an hour to 
gather all of her friends.  Everyone sensed that Ami had 
something particularly important to report and made quick 
arrangements to free up the morning.

&quot;It actually explains quite a bit and meshes well with what I 
recall from the Silver Millennium,&quot; Artemis noted.  

&quot;Let me make sure I understand,&quot; Rei said carefully. &quot;You are 
saying that the sun generates both positive energy, like the kind 
that powers our abilities and the Millennium Crystal, and also
negative energy like our enemies use.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it always generates both, but not in equal amounts.  I 
believe that there is a cycle, with positive energy waxing and 
waning alongside the negative.  Periods such as the Silver 
Millennium occurred while the positive energy was dominant.  That 
might explain why there was so much more magic in use and how the 
moon and other planets were habitable,&quot; Ami explained.  &quot;At other 
times, though, the negative energy becomes prevalent.   I would 
guess that it was at such times that the foes of the Silver 
Millennium were at their peak.  I also think it could explain the 
mass extinctions that have occurred deep in the past.&quot;

&quot;And we&#39;re moving into such a time now?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;My readings show massive amounts of negative energy being put 
out by the sun.  We did not detect it before because our 
instruments are designed to register dangerous spikes of energy 
such as those used by our enemies.  This is a more constant 
barrage at a lower level,&quot; Ami responded.

&quot;A lower, but still dangerous level, you mean,&quot; Michiru 
clarified.

&quot;Yes. I believe that the degeneration that we call &#39;hypercancer&#39; 
is really an overdose of negative energy.  I&#39;m afraid that, in 
time, it will affect almost everyone on the planet.&quot;

&quot;Why &#39;almost everyone&#39;?&quot; Haruka asked.

&quot;I did some tests on myself,&quot; Ami continued, ignoring the 
concerned glare from Makoto.  &quot;I am not affected at all.&quot;

&quot;We are beings of positive energy.  That is what the Moon Kingdom 
is all about,&quot; Usagi noted.  &quot;Just as we can resist the powers of 
our foes, we can resist this.  But, what about everyone else, 
Ami-chan?  There must be something we can do!&quot;

&quot;I think there is,&quot; Ami offered. &quot;We know that there must be a 
solution, since we all have seen Crystal Tokyo.  That is what led 
me to this conclusion.  You all remember that Wiseman was trying 
to plant crystals of negative energy throughout the past to help 
his cause.  Well, just as there are crystals of negative energy, 
I believe that there are also crystals of positive energy in the 
universe.  The greatest, purest of these is most likely sitting 
in Usagi&#39;s brooch right now.  There should be others, however.&quot;

&quot;How will crystals help?&quot; Mina inquired.

&quot;I believe that if we can gather enough positive energy crystals, 
we can construct a matrix throughout the planet that would 
collect and store positive energy from the sun.  During the times 
when the positive energy was peaking, it would gather that 
energy.   Those stores could then be drawn upon on the downside 
of the cycle.  Such a construct should eliminate the threat of 
the cycle all together.&quot;  

Haruka rose to her feet.  &quot;Well, tell us how to find them.  We 
can leave immediately.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that easy,&quot; Ami went on. &quot;I don&#39;t believe there are any 
left on Earth itself.  We&#39;ll have to search for them in the other 
parts of the solar system and very likely other parts of the 
galaxy.&quot;

&quot;But that could take years, decades!  Even using the powers we 
observed the Starlights using, it is no easy thing to jaunt off 
to the nearest star!&quot;  Haruka complained.

&quot;What about the people here now?  Can they last long enough?&quot; 
Makoto wondered quietly.  

Ami shook her head sadly.  This was the one issue she had not 
been able to wrap her mind around.  The room grew quiet.

&quot;We can freeze them,&quot; Usagi whispered.  

&quot;What did you say?&quot; Ami asked, startled out her melancholy 
silence.

Raising her voice, Usagi repeated, &quot;We can freeze them.  We&#39;ve 
seen it done.  When Wiseman attacked, Neo-Queen Serenity placed 
herself in stasis, supported by all of you.   That protected her 
while we fought with Wiseman.&quot;  She raised her eyes and met the 
gaze of each of her friends calmly.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure exactly how, 
but I know I can do this.&quot;

&quot;But, Usagi, Neo-Queen Serenity enclosed a palace, not an entire 
world,&quot; Rei pointed out gently.  

Usagi leaned forward to pat Rei on the knee.  &quot;She didn&#39;t have 
the Silver Millennium Crystal and she didn&#39;t have time to 
prepare.  We do.  It will work.  Trust me. Please.&quot;

Rei nodded gravely, as did all the others.  

The calm confidence Usagi projected faltered for a moment as she 
turned back to Ami.  &quot;Is there anything we can do to heal my...to 
heal everyone that is afflicted?&quot;

Once again, Ami shook her head ruefully.  &quot;I don&#39;t believe so.  
You have cured others before, but there is a difference between 
those who were assaulted suddenly by the magics of our enemies 
and those who have been inundated for weeks, months, or years.  
It may be possible, as we construct the crystal matrix, that 
those people who have resisted the disease until now will be 
cleansed of any trace amounts of negative energy.  Those who are 
already sick, though...&quot;  Ami&#39;s voice trailed off.  

Usagi closed her eyes and took a deep breath.  After a moment, 
she set her shoulders, opened her eyes, and announced, &quot;I think 
we had all better make peace with our lives.  I&#39;m going to need 
all of...&quot;

Suddenly, the phone rang.  Makoto glanced at the caller ID.  
&quot;It&#39;s from your house, Usagi-chan.  Maybe it&#39;s your husband.&quot;  
Mamoru had remained behind to watch the baby, as Ikuko had grown 
much too ill to tend the little one on her own.   Wordlessly, 
Usagi took the receiver.  &quot;Mamo-chan,&quot; she said quietly.  Her 
friends watched in silence as she listened to her husband.  The 
blood drained from her face and her eyes grew moist.  &quot;I&#39;ll be 
home right away,&quot; she said eventually.  &quot;I love you, too, Mamo-
chan.&quot;  Hanging up the phone, she turned to the room.  

&quot;Ikuko-mama did not wake up this morning,&quot; she said in a steely 
voice.  Everyone gasped.  Some sobbed or began to cry openly.  
Usagi stood grimly, tears welling her eyes.  &quot;You all, and Mamo-
chan and Usagi, are my family now.  We have a job to do so that 
not one person more than we can avoid need suffer similar 
losses.&quot;  She smiled wanly at her friends.  &quot;I will need you all 
to do this, just as I&#39;ve always needed all of you to win any 
battle.  I will need all of your power, for we have a very large 
area to cover.   I know I can count on you.&quot;

&quot;Oh Usagi,&quot; Rei whispered weakly through her tears.  Ikuko had 
been the closest thing she had had to a mother.  

Usagi laid a hand gently on Rei&#39;s shoulder, shaking her head 
lightly.  &quot;There is only one Usagi now,&quot; she said, her tears 
flowing freely.  

Rei nodded, understanding immediately.  The world would never 
again be the same from this day forward.  Taking Minako&#39;s hand in 
her own, she slid from the sofa to the floor, onto one knee.  
Ami, Makoto, then Haruka, Michiru, Setsuna, and Hotaru all 
followed suit.  Luna and Artemis dropped their heads respectfully
