<h1>It's Sometimes Called Falling in Love (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alli.html">Haruka</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She had always been strong. The only thoughts of her demise were for 
the cause.

The cause. Heh. That&#39;s a joke.

The cause was no more. Returning to normal life would have been good, 
had she chosen to lose her memories. Those nights with Michiru by the 
sea -- all those years of working up the courage to confess and then 
celebrate their love; those years she couldn&#39;t bear to lose. She was 
disillusioned when she thought that she could live with those 
memories. Memories of times when they both were happy.

Michiru and I. There is no plural. Don&#39;t combine her with you.

Memories was all she had now. Yesterday was all that filled her mind, 
because today was lonely and desolate. Today, she was a racer, but 
knowing that Michiru wasn&#39;t out in the stands killed the passion 
almost as fast as it shredded her heart. Michiru chose to forget, and 
Haruka didn&#39;t blame her. As Sailor Neptune, she had gone through so 
many trials... more than Haruka did as Sailor Uranus. Sailor Neptune 
had watched her friends being massacred and torn apart limb-by-limb as 
Sailor Uranus was unconscious. She could only take losing the Moon 
Princess so often... she could only take losing Uranus once. The final 
battle broke her.

Haruka&#39;s thoughts returned back to the deep slashes on her wrists. She 
didn&#39;t hear the door being slammed in.

I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m going to die... maybe I&#39;m already dead.

As her vision blurred and her breath slowed to a fatal hault, she 
couldn&#39;t will her hands to touch the face of her beloved one last 
time.

~*~

White. All she could see was white. Then, the white blur sharpened to 
curtains, sheets, an IV syringe, and a heart moniter chirping it&#39;s 
monotone rhythm.

&quot;You&#39;re awake&quot; a voice too familiar involuntarily whispered hoarsly.

&quot;Looks like it.&quot; Haruka&#39;s throaght was dry. She looked around for 
liquid.

&quot;I hate you.&quot; The aquamarine-haired woman&#39;s cold statement was warmed 
by the tears that followed.

&quot;Why-why are you crying?&quot;

In between broken sobs, the woman stated:

&quot;You&#39;re stupid. Trying to commit suicide. You were supposed to be my 
friend. You&#39;re not supposed to leave like that.&quot;

Not exactly knowing what the being was doing by her bed, or why she 
had called her a friend, she felt a tug at her heart knowing that she 
had caused the foreign woman&#39;s tears. Gently, in a new but strangely 
natural movement, Haruka gently directed the nymph&#39;s chin to where she 
could gently wipe away her tears.

&quot;Don&#39;t cry over me.&quot; The words sounded like a seranade, making the 
woman uncomfortable, because the open portals of her eyes became 
filtered, and her movements constricted. All this was just augmented 
by another unrecognizable figure hesitantly standing at the door.

&quot;Michiru, you ready to go to- Oh! Haruka&#39;s up.&quot; Her voice was less 
than joyful.

Haruka felt a pang of jealousy and depression well up inside her, 
though she wasn&#39;t quite sure why.

Michiru, that apparently being her name, abruptly got up, whispered 
something about returning later, and slipped out of the room, leaving 
Haruka to delve over her emotions.

This only lasted a moment or two, however, because a face she could 
recognize entered the room. The eyes of the woman with deep green hair 
held an understanding of the feelings, knowing the reason. Haruka 
wished she knew.

&quot;There&#39;s no use in killing yourself for her.&quot; Setsuna said. &quot;I know 
what it&#39;s like to watch the person you love be with another. Michiru 
is happy right now. That should make you happy too.&quot;

&quot;...What?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no use in hiding your motives.&quot;

&quot;What motives? For what?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re in a hospital.&quot;

&quot;Yeah... why?&quot;

&quot;...do you remember trying to committ suicide?&quot;

&quot;...suicide?&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s eyes widened as she grasped the reality of the situation.

&quot;What do you remember about Michiru?&quot;

&quot;She was that girl who was here just a second ago... the 
aquamarine-haired one, right?&quot;

&quot;...you&#39;ve forgotten.&quot;

&quot;What? Setsuna.. what are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Nothing. Here&#39;s your water.&quot;

&quot;But-&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t ask questions, Haruka... just drink.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s emotions when Michiru&#39;s girlfriend walked into the room 
didn&#39;t fail to make her wince. When she and Michiru talked, the sense 
of familiarity was so natural, though the blonde didn&#39;t know quite 
why... but she knew one thing: she was falling in love with Michiru, 
encountering one thing she promised she&#39;d never experience again: 
unrequited love.

For hours she would ride on her motorcycle, trying to clear her head 
on why she was having forbidden emotions for this new woman, but she 
could never come up with a clearer explination than the feeling that 
there was a force drawing the blonde to her... greater than the tug of 
the wind upon her sleeves.

At first, she disliked Michiru&#39;s girlfriend greater than anything, 
because she wanted to believe that Michiru and she could really be 
together. She boiled with anger everytime Michiru cried over harsh 
words, but tried to keep any hint of her emotions to a minimum. These 
raging battles in her mind kept her awake until the early hours of the 
morning, trying to stop loving the beautiful Michiru. She pretended 
that she really was just joking when she complimented and worshiped 
Michiru more than friends do, saying with all her heart and a 
sarcastic tone that anyone would kill to be with her. In reality, the 
friendship was both her reason for living and the demise of her heart. 

Finally, in those wee hours, she wrote a letter to her... she read it 
to Setsuna, who had become her confidon, and the crimson-eyed mature 
woman simply nodded with painful approval. This was all that was 
needed for Haruka to board her motorcycle and speed across the vast 
city towards Michiru&#39;s apartment.

Haruka looked through the apartment window, and saw the reason that 
Michiru should never be told that the letter was for her: she was 
smiling happily chatting on the phone. She stood there watching her 
for a good hour before she remounted her motorcycle and sped off, 
dropping a trail of tears behind her.
