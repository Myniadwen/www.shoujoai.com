And your left with yesterday
Left with the memories
I, I&#39;ll always think of you and smile
And be happy for the time
I had you with me~

Sailor Moon gasped as she was slammed into the hard stone. Fear was 
clearly seen in her eyes. Tears began to stream down her face as 
Mitusakai&#39;s hand beang to tighten around her throat.

&quot;Let her go!&quot; Mars tried her attack, but Mitsuakai easily repelled it 
back towards her. 

Yung hu roared and ran to the side of his companion and then tackeld 
her to the ground. Sailor Moon fell to the ground, clucthing her 
throat gently. Yung Hu then picked up Mitsuakai by her throat slamming 
her as hard as he could into the clock tower, knocking her heart. Her 
limp body then fell to the ground.

&quot;Why in the hell did she do that,&quot; Mars cried angrily.

Yung Hu glanced up ay Mars then back down at his ward&#39;s limp body. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know.&quot; He then bent over and gently picked Mitsuakai up in his 
arms. Standing straight back up again, he looked over at Venus. 

They stared at one another for a moment, then Yung Hu jumped towards 
the trees, laniding on the branch and jumping again. Spreading his 
wings, he caught an up draft and was gone.

Venus watched him go before sprinting off.

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako banged on Makoto&#39;s door. Why had Yung Hu told her to come here 
when he contacted her pyshically. Minako stepped away from the door 
when she heard someone unlocking it.

&quot;Mako-cha-&quot; Minako began then stared at the person who had opened the 
door. &quot;Yung Hu!?&quot;

He nodded and stepped aside to allow Minako in. &quot;Follow me.&quot; He then 
walked towards Makoto&#39;s bedroom after closing the door behind Minako. 

Minako followed him, un aware of what was going on.

&quot;Whats going on, Yung Hu? And how did you know who I was?&quot;

Yung Hu pressed his talon against his lips, motioning for Minako to be 
quiet. He then opened the bedroom door. Inside was Makoto with a 
bandage on her head. Minako stared at her in shock.

&quot;Is she-?&quot;

Yung hu nodded. &quot;Hai. She&#39;s Sailor Jupiter and Mitsuakai.&quot; He then 
closed the door, allowing Makoto to continue sleep.

&quot;But...How? I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Minako said thru tears.

Minako walked to the living room and sat down on the couch, covering 
her face with her hands. She sensed a bright light in the room and 
looked up again. In front of her, sitting on the coffe table was Ace. 
She looked at him in disbelief.

&quot;Its a very long story,&quot; he said, closing his eyes.

~Please remember, please remember
I was there for you 
and you were there for me
Please remember, our time together
The time was yours and mine 
while we were wild and free
Please remember, please remember me~ 

::flash back::

A few weeks after Minako&#39;s funeral, Makoto was starting to put her 
life back together. She had started working again, to get her mind off 
of things.

Makoto worked the night shift of an electronics store. She was the 
manager and usually let the workers of her shift off if the night was 
slow. During such a night, Makoto was alone in the store. As her shift 
started to come to a close, she locked everything up and retrieved her 
things from her locker.

After locking the front door, Makoto slipped the keys into her pocket 
and began to walk home. Since she lived less than two blocks from the 
store, Makoto rarely drove to work. Unless it was very cold outside. 
She was never worried about walking home so late. She was a master at 
the martial arts, and could easily defend herself agaisnt any one.

As she walked home, she heard something rattleing behind her. She 
turned and saw nothing but an empty street. Shrugging, she continued 
to walk. 

She heard something again and when she turned around, something 
grabbed her and threw her into an alley. Makoto, caught off guard, 
fell to the ground. Quickly standing, she saw what had grabbed her. It 
wasn&#39;t human.

Makoto quickly jumped up and took a fighting stance. The youma that 
had attacked her was near black in the dark alley, bu Makoto could 
make out a few of its body parts. Such as its horns, wings and tail. 
It seemed to have been about 7 to 8 feet tall, but Makoto could have 
sworn it was much larger.

The youma had her cornored in the back of the alley so Makoto had to 
fight her way out of the alley.

The youma backed her further into the alley, towering over her. Makoto 
made a run for the side but quickly changed directions when the 
monster tried to attack her. She dodged to the left and grabbed a 
trash can and quickly threw it at the youma&#39;s face. The creature 
snarled and quickly wrapped its arm aorund Makoto&#39;s wasit as she made 
a mad dash to escape. 

It flung her back into the alley, her body hitting the wall so hard, 
the brick cracked. Makoto fell to her knees and shook her head, 
surprised she hadn&#39;t been knocked out.

*I should have known the youma would want to run a muck after Minako 
died. I&#39;ll have to take over her job I guess..*

Rain began to fall as Makoto stood and charged the 8 foot beast. The 
two fell to the ground and Makoto tried once again to escape. The 
youma, however, quickly grabbed hold of her slammed her back into the 
alley...

::end of flash back::

&quot;The fight went on for a few minutes more before the youma finally 
grabbed hold of Makoto and snapped her neck,&quot; Ace said quietly.

Minako gasped. &quot;Well, waht happened after that?&quot;

&quot;She died,&quot; Ace said bluntly as if Minako should have known.

Minako looked at the cat as if he were insane. &quot;Demo..she&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;Oh yea, I&#39;m alive, now. But it took alot of magic to get me back that 
way,&quot; said a voice from the shadow of the hallway. 

Minako looked up to see Makoto with her arms crossed over her chest, 
leaning against the wall.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said, standing. &quot;Are you-?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; She nodded her head towards the balconey and Mianko 
nodded, following Makoto outside.

------------------------------------------------------------

::flashback::

Moments after the youma had snapped Makoto&#39;s neck, her prone body fell 
to the ground. The creature fell to his knees and hands, preparing to 
feast on the poor girl who&#39;s life he had just taken.

As he lowered his head to feed, a bright light made the youma look up. 
A bright figure had appeared in the alley, intending to destroy the 
monster. The youma snarled and stood once again as the figure&#39;s body 
lost its glow. It was a young man with white silvery hair and green 
eyes. He wore garments of white and baby blue silk that were draped 
all over his body. In his hand he held a golden staff. 

The youma charged the man, but the man did not step aside. Instead, he 
raised his staff which emitted a magic that sent the monster flying 
into the same wall Makoto had hit only moments before. A light 
encircled the youma, and it screamed in pain. Soon, the youma slumped 
forward with a loud thud.

The young man looked down at Makoto and sighed sadly. He pointed his 
wand towards the sky, a light shooting from it. The light encircled 
both Makoto and the youma. The light flished several times before 
going completly white. When the light faded, only Makoto remained. 

::end of flashback::

~ Goodbye, there&#39;s just no sadder word to say
And it&#39;s sad to walk away 
with just the memories
Who&#39;s to know what might have been
We&#39;ll leave behind a life and time 
I&#39;ll never know again

Please remember, please remember
I was there for you 
and you were there for me
And remember, Please remember me

Please remember, please remember
I was there for you 
And you were there for me
Please remember, our time together
The time was yours and mine 
While we were wild and free
Then remeber, please remeber me~

Makoto was leaning forward on her railing, a cigarette in her hand. 
Minako stood behind her, completly in shock.

&quot;So, tahts how you survived? This man combined your body with that 
youma&#39;s?&quot;

Makoto nodded numbly. &quot;Hai. And, until recently, I have been able to 
keep it under control. The when I recieved my senshi powers...&quot;

Minako nodded and walked to stand next to Makoto. Her gaze fell on the 
quiet Tokyo skyline.

&quot;I can&#39;t control it any more, Minako,&quot; Makoto said quietly. &quot;I nearly 
killed an innocent tonight.&quot;

&quot;But Usagi will understand,&quot; Minako said. &quot;She&#39;ll know you didn&#39;t mean 
to.&quot;

&quot;She may. As well as the others. But Mina,&quot; Makoto said looking up at 
Minako. &quot;What will she think if it keeps happening?&quot;

&quot;Maybe she could heal you-&quot;

&quot;She heals me and I die. I may have my memories, but I&#39;m surviving on 
that beast&#39;s life force. She takes that away from me, and I will die.&quot; 
Makoto took a drag off of her cigarette and flipped it over the 
balconey.

The two stood in silence for moments on end.

&quot;I&#39;ve decided to leave,&quot; Makoto said, looking down towards the street.

&quot;Nani!?&quot; Minako looked at her in disbelief. &quot;Makoto, you can&#39;t leave 
now...&quot;

&quot;I have to, Minako. If I don&#39;t, I will hurt other people. I may even 
kill them. You know I have to do this.&quot;

Tears began to run down Minako&#39;s face. &quot;Mako-chan...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll leave in the morning. You can pretend you didn&#39;t know..&quot;

&quot;Iie! I will not aft like you left,&quot; Minako said angerily. &quot;I will not 
pretend because you will not leave. As the leader of the senshi, I 
forbid it!&quot;

Makoto just turned and raised her eyebrow, looking at Minako. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think so. I&#39;m leaving in the morning. You can&#39;t change my mind.&quot;

Makoto then turned to walk back inside. Minako stood there, so many 
things racing in her mind. She turned her head to look at Makoto.

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto stopped and looked at Minako. &quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Can I stay with you tonight?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Morning came quicker than Makoto had origanily wanted it to. She crept 
out of her bed, showered and dressed. She then packed a small duffel 
bag of clothes. She heard a whimpering noise from her bed and turned 
to see Minako still asleep, cuddled up next to her pillow.

Makoto had to hold in the tears as she walked back over to Minako and 
kissed her head gently. 

Makoto then whispered, &quot;I love you, Mina,&quot; into the blonde&#39;s sleeping 
hair before walking out of the bedroom and into the living room.

There, sititng on the living room table was Ace. 

&quot;Will you tell her goodbye for me?&quot;

Ace nodded sadly. &quot;Hai.&quot;

Makoto walked over to him and picked him up and hugged him, and Ace 
purred in her ear. Makoto could feel something wet hit her ear and 
knew he was crying.

&quot;I love you, Ace. Thanks for being there for me,&quot; Makoto said, sitting 
him back down.

Ace nodded. &quot;I love you, too. Take care of yourself, Mako-chan.&quot; He 
then watched Makoto walk out of her apartment, noticeing she had left 
her keys there.

She wasn&#39;t coming back.

~And how we laugh and how we smile
And how this heart was yours and mine
and how a dream was out of reach
I stood by you, you stood by me
We took each day and made it shine
We wrote our names across the sky
We ride so fast, we ride so free
And I knew that you had me

Please remember, please remember~ </pre>
