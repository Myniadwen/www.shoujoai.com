<body>
<p>The pervious night had been a hectic blur for the Princess of the Moon Kingdom.</p>
<p>She’d  heard the commotion; the frantic running as her warriors rushed past  her room towards the senshi wing, and she’d cracked her door open in  response, only to be met with Sailor Pluto’s unreadable garnet eyes.  The enigmatic woman had explained that Mars had returned, and that the  others believed she was fighting Minako. She had also suggested that  the Princess return to her room where it was safe.</p>
<p>And Serenity  had rebelled. She was tired of their over protection, tired of their  attempts to shield her not only from battle, but from herself. She  wouldn’t have it any longer.</p>
<p>Serenity had defied Sailor Pluto, and she took off on her heels, running after her senshi towards Minako’s room.</p>
<p>She  had stood there, standing on the edges of her toes to see over  Mercury’s head. Soon afterwards, she had felt Uranus and Neptune at her  back. Serenity had watched with them - Venus’ sobbing form, her frame  shaking as she held Rei’s unconscious body to her chest.</p>
<p>She’d  rushed into the room then, pushing between her warriors that were  transfixed by the door, to kneel by Venus’ side, eager to reassure her,  to calm her, and to see to the needs of her two friends; two of her  strongest senshi. She’d looked to Rei’s wound and shouted back at  Mercury. Rei was going to be all right, but they needed a medic.</p>
<p>And that was when her eyes had fallen on a small square of crumpled paper, held loosely in Rei’s left hand.</p>
<p>Her name was printed on it in elegant handwriting, small and precise.</p>
<p>She  had reached for it; a subtle, deft movement, perhaps born from the  training she’d received at her senshi’s hands. Mercury and Jupiter had  finally come to her side to help Rei and Minako, and Serenity had  carefully slipped the small note into the folds of her dress, where it  joined the communicator Endymion had given her.</p>
<p>But that’s where Minako and Rei’s story ended, and hers began. For now, the two of them were <em>’sleeping it off’</em>.  Although they weren’t likely ‘sleeping it off’ in the Venusian’s usual,  glorified sense of the term, Minako and Rei had been through a lot in  the time that Mars had been captured by Beryl and held to Metallia’s  will, and the fight they’d had against the dark being had taken its  toll on both women.</p>
<p>In all honesty, Serenity was happy for her  two warriors. She was. But she couldn’t curb the sadness that chipped  away at her heart, at her very soul.</p>
<p>For in the end, <em>they</em> had been reunited while she had not yet heard any news from Endymion.</p>
<p>Her  fingers bypassed the smooth plastic of the communicator that had been  silent for far too long, and she clutched the finely folded note  instead.</p>
<p>Serenity walked the perimeter of her room and double  checked that her doors were securely closed. Content that Sailor Pluto  was standing guard outside the antechamber to her bedroom without  feeling the need to keep a visual check on her, Serenity climbed onto  the windowsill next to her bed and pulled her hand from her dress.</p>
<p>With  shaking hands, she unfolded the note. Unsure fingers tore a corner, and  with her frantic grip, she nearly ripped through one of the creases. As  soon as enough of the page came into view, she began to read.</p>
<p><em>Serenity,  please do not worry. I have not switched sides. Beryl is reluctant to  brainwash me, and I hope that with that advantage, I may be able to  prevent war from breaking out between Earth and the Moon. I don’t know  how, yet, but I will try my hardest. And I promise to return to your  arms a better man and the rightful ruler of my peoples. </em></p>
<p><em>Love, Endymion.</em></p>
<p>After  she’d read it, Serenity read it again. The Earth made its trek across  the horizon and her actions began to compromise the integrity of the  note. She soon found that it didn’t matter, that by the time her tears  had drowned the ink and her shaking hands had torn the paper, she’d  already had the passage committed to memory.</p>
<p>It was a knock on her door that finally tore her eyes from the remains of the note.</p>
<p>“My Princess, breakfast has come and gone. It is nearly time for lunch and you have not yet left your quarters.”</p>
<p>Serenity  shifted on the windowsill. Her rear end had long since gone numb, and  her bloodshot eyes were dry and tired. “Thank you, Sailor Pluto, but I  do not wish to eat at the moment.”</p>
<p>“Then I wish to inform you  that I am due to meet with the rest of the senshi shortly, and to  remind you that you have an audience with your mother at twelve hundred  hours.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Sailor Pluto. I will not forget.”</p>
<p>The  guardian of the time gate went silent. Serenity listened carefully  until she could hear the senshi’s quiet footfalls as she departed.</p>
<p>Slowly,  Serenity stood, her legs tingling and her head swimming for having  spent the greater part of the night and the morning in a single pose.  She reached into her dress and examined Endymion’s communicator,  contemplating it thoughtfully for several moments.</p>
<p>Finally, her fingers flew across the keypad for a brief moment. In the communicator’s blue screen, one line was displayed:</p>
<p>-Endymion – I’m coming for you-</p>
<hr />
<p>“I… attacked you.” Rei looked put off, and wouldn’t meet the taller woman’s eyes. “I apologize.”</p>
<p>Haruka  only laughed. She reached out and laid a hand on the Martian’s  shoulder. “It’s okay. I think I deserved it. After all, you thought I  was attacking your woman, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Rei colored and Minako  grinned a toothy smile. Makoto hid a smirk by finding a sudden interest  in the program Ami was working on at her computer. Michiru made a  quiet, passing comment about the similarities between Martians and  Uranians.</p>
<p>“I have to admit,” Haruka said while scratching at the  back of her neck, “I haven’t been knocked out like that since I was a  little kid. I knew you had it in you. Perhaps we can spar for real  sometime.”</p>
<p>Rei finally offered Haruka a genuine smile. “I’d like that, Haruka-san.”</p>
<p>A  soft click of the courtyard’s door opening didn’t seem to bother the  others, but Rei’s attention drifted to the presence of a tall, dark  skinned woman. Clothed in a deep green sailor fuku, the woman strode  across the floor and took a seat at one of the chaise lounges. The  Martian found herself performing a mental scan on the new warrior,  reaching out with her still exhausted senses, just on the off chance  that this woman who seemed familiar with the others might be a threat,  but when those garnet eyes turned towards her, Rei shuddered. Although  the Martian didn’t feel the slightest threat from her, she couldn’t  read much of anything from the woman, either.</p>
<p>A strong slap to  the back of her shoulder nearly caused Rei to topple out of her chair  and the Martian was forced to tear her attention away from the  enigmatic woman and to Makoto instead.</p>
<p>The Jovian wore a winning  smile and pumped a fist into the air. “If you were able to reverse  Beryl’s brainwashing and banish Metallia from your mind, then she can’t  be <em>that</em> tough to beat, right?”</p>
<p>Rei struggled between  answering the question and revealing information while a stranger was  present. Minako noted her partner’s distrustful gaze on the newcomer.  With a shoulder pressed to Rei’s on the chaise they shared, she laid a  reassuring hand on the Martian’s thigh.</p>
<p>“This is Sailor Pluto, Rei. She’s one of the outers that aid Haruka-san and Michiru-san. She guards the time gates.”</p>
<p>Pluto tipped her head in the slightest. “Nice to meet you, Rei-san. I’ve heard much about you.”</p>
<p>Cool, amethyst eyes openly examined Sailor Pluto.</p>
<p>Michiru stepped forward and rested a hand on Pluto’s shoulder. “Setsuna,” she said pointedly, “why don’t you join us?”</p>
<p>Pluto  looked to her friend in question, but then realized her mistake. Almost  hesitantly, a sapphire light enveloped her, and her civilian persona  was left in Pluto’s wake. Without the menacing staff and the formal  warrior’s outfit, even if her eyes were still hard to read, the others  felt a little more at ease, to include the mistrustful Marian.</p>
<p>“My apologies,” she said, addressing all of them. “Rei-san, my name is also Setsuna.”</p>
<p>Finally, Rei nodded, and feeling somewhat more at ease, she returned the greeting.</p>
<p>“Please, go ahead,” Michiru prompted the Martian, “You were going to tell us more about your experience with Metallia.”</p>
<p>Rei nodded and paid careful attention to her hands in her lap. “The power that I… the power that <em>Minako</em> and I defeated, it was… a mere fraction of Metallia’s potential.”</p>
<p>“Rei?”</p>
<p>The  Martian looked to her partner. Her amethyst eyes were haunted as she  remembered the foreign presence that had tinged her world in a darkened  haze. She nodded. “The Metallia I encountered was just a small part of  the being from the Sun. She was being funneled through Beryl, her  avatar.”</p>
<p>“Her power would have been greatly diminished.” Michiru agreed sagely.</p>
<p>Finally,  Minako gripped Rei’s thigh. She forced a smile for her warriors.  “Metallia is still an enemy. And she has an avatar. She can’t be  unbeatable. We’ll find a way. I know we will.”</p>
<p>The Martian  nodded. The silence was oppressive. Ami busily inputted the new  information into her computer, but the others pointedly avoided eye  contact.</p>
<p>“So…” Rei tried her hardest to shift away from uncomfortable conversation, “How is Serenity’s training proceeding?”</p>
<p>“She’s  come a long way in such a short time. It’s truly incredible!” Minako  exclaimed, also eager for the diversion. “She’s spent time with nearly  each of us, learning different techniques and styles.</p>
<p>Haruka rose  from her lounge chair and began to pace restlessly. “But… what little  she’s learned in hand to hand combat and battle tactics will get her no  where against the enemies we’re up against, and yet you continue to let  her fool herself into letting her think she can make a difference?”</p>
<p>Rei frowned slightly. “I was under the impression that we were catering to her whims only to give her something to <em>do</em>.”</p>
<p>Minako fidgeted. “That’s partially correct. But… you have to understand, Serenity… she leads with her heart.”</p>
<p>Haruka snorted. “With all due respect, I <em>don’t</em> see how that will help us on the field of battle.”</p>
<p>“Don’t  doubt our Princess.” Everyone in the room turned to Rei’s sudden  defiance. Her voice quieted. Her gaze was distant and centered on  nothing in particular. “Somehow, I have a feeling that her fragile  heart may save us all.”</p>
<p>Minako rested her elbows on her knees to get a better look at the Martian’s shielded eyes. “A premonition?”</p>
<p>“Hardly.” Rei scowled. ”I can’t see much of anything anymore.”</p>
<p>“Nor can I.” Michiru added.</p>
<p>Setsuna  only nodded. “There are too many possible futures confusing the time  stream right now. Not even I can get a clear reading.”</p>
<p>An  oppressive silence descended once again. Makoto stood to restlessly  pace across one side of the room. Suddenly, Minako stood. “Where <em>is</em> Serenity, anyway?” The Venusian looked around the room with wide eyes. “Who was assigned guard duty?”</p>
<p>“I  had guard duty last.” Setsuna said calmly. “She told me late last night  that she had a meeting with her mother this afternoon.”</p>
<p>The blood drained from Minako’s complexion. “Queen Serenity is in war deliberations all day.”</p>
<p>“Damn  it.” Makoto cursed. “I’m going to her quarters.” Not waiting for her  leader’s approval, the Jovian became Sailor Jupiter, and she dashed for  the door.</p>
<p>“Rei!” Minako snapped.</p>
<p>“I’m already on it.” The  Martian had gone stock still, her consciousness spreading, rushing past  Makoto’s running form, slipping down corridors and through walls. She  searched Serenity’s empty bedroom twice and then cast around the rest  of the palace. “I can’t find her. She’s not in the palace!”</p>
<p>A sweat broke across Rei’s brow. There was only one other place Serenity might have gone.</p>
<p>“You don’t think she could have…” Ami’s hesitant question went unanswered.</p>
<p>Rei  ground her teeth. Her consciousness ascended to the black sky, drifted  past the pull of the Moon’s gravity, crossed the vast distance between  her new home and the Earth. Her frame began to shake. She wasn’t sure,  even with Minako’s gentle strength at her side, if she had the power to  stretch herself that far.</p>
<p>She was vaguely aware of Minako’s quiet voice. “Rei… stop. You’ve been through too much to use those powers right now.”</p>
<p>Rei’s  consciousness was slowed as it streaked through the clouds and neared  that small, island nation of Nippon. The distance from her body was so  far, and the darkness of Metallia’s taint was everywhere. She pushed  just a little further. Finally, the Martian’s eyes shot open.</p>
<p>“Earth!” She exclaimed, voicing that dirty word that the others were afraid to hear, “She’s at the Edo palace.”</p>
<p>Jupiter’s  frantic voice was amplified across the combined power of each of the  women’s communicators. “She’s not in her room!” She shouted.</p>
<p>“She’s on Earth.” Ami was the only one who could seem to get her voice to work to inform Jupiter.</p>
<p>Minako  supported Rei’s weak form while taking command and barking orders. “I’m  leading a recon mission. We’re going in after her.”</p>
<p>“I’m coming with you.” Jupiter demanded.</p>
<p>Minako growled. “No. Rei and I will go.”</p>
<p>Ami stood, her brow furrowed. “But Rei-“</p>
<p>The  Martian batted Minako’s supportive hands from her body and stood on her  own with shaky legs. “I’m fine. Minako and I will go. We saw what  happened last time when there were too many of us on the surface.”</p>
<p>“Rei  and I know the palace best. She can track Serenity directly, and we can  get in there, get her, and get the hell out. This is a <em>recon</em> mission,” she stressed, “not war with Edo or Earth.”</p>
<p>Jupiter snorted her displeasure across their communicator.</p>
<p>“Ami-chan,”  Minako commanded, “you will stay behind. You can help us track Serenity  via the Eternal Main System.” The Mercurian nodded sharply.</p>
<p>“Haruka-san,  Michiru-san, Setsuna-san, Mako-chan,” the Venusian turned towards the  outers with a steely look, “I don’t expect an attack, but can I entrust  the security of the palace against the youma threat to you four?” The  Uranian grunted and stood tall for her team.</p>
<p>“Let me go with you!” Makoto growled again. “I’ll pilot the shuttle, provide a quick escape!”</p>
<p>“No time.” Minako barked. “Rei and I will Sailor Teleport down there.”</p>
<p>“You two can <em>do</em> that?” Ami asked. “It’s always taken more than two senshi in the past.”</p>
<p>Minako all but shrugged. “We’ve done it before.”</p>
<p>“But can you teleport <em>back</em> with the Princess safely?” Makoto argued.</p>
<p>Minako’s  eyes hardened. “Fine. Mako-chan, using Ami-chan’s coordinates, you’ll  meet us on the surface with a shuttle to get us the <em>hell</em> off that planet once we have Serenity.”</p>
<p>“Roger that.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“I  told you not to come here.” In the predawn dark of the rose garden,  Endymion’s actions belied his words, and he pulled the Princess of the  Moon Kingdom closer to his body.</p>
<p>Serenity grabbed the lapels of  Endymion’s jacket in tightly balled fists as she battled back tears. “I  couldn’t help it. I was so worried! When Rei-chan came back… the note  just wasn’t enough. I had to <em>see</em> you!”</p>
<p>Endymion sighed in relief. “Rei, is she-“</p>
<p>“Minako helped her. They banished Metallia together.”</p>
<p>The exiled prince drew Serenity impossibly closer. “Then there’s hope in the fight against her.”</p>
<p>“Hope?” Serenity asked, pulling back to capture the man’s dark eyes. “There’s <em>always</em> hope, Endymion.”</p>
<p>He snorted and rested his chin on the top of her head. ‘”I wish it were so easy.”</p>
<p>“Let me help you.”</p>
<p>Endymion pulled back, nearly frightened by the determination he found in the woman he thought he knew so well.</p>
<p>“Come back with me,” she urged, “we’ll find a way to fight Beryl and Metallia together.”</p>
<p>A  frown tugged at Endymion’s lips. “I can’t leave. Beryl won’t hesitate  to declare war and attack your kingdom right away. That’s why this is  something I have to do on my own.”</p>
<p>“Endymion…”</p>
<p>“I owe it to her. You understand that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Serenity allowed for the smallest of smiles. “She loves you, doesn’t she?”</p>
<p>He tightened his grip on her unconsciously. “She does. She has for a long time. It’s always been one sided.”</p>
<p>“Of course it is. It’s why she doesn’t want to brainwash you.”</p>
<p>Endymion  could only nod in awe at Serenity’s understanding. She could be  refreshingly childlike and completely naive, but she could also be  deceptively deep and incredibly mature when the situation called for it.</p>
<p>“This is my fight.” He repeated. “Now tell me, Serenity, do you trust me?”</p>
<p>“With everything I am.” She replied. “But that doesn’t mean I won’t keep searching for a way to help you.”</p>
<p>“Then will you promise to keep on fighting no matter what happens?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Endymion.”</p>
<p>The Princess of the Moon Kingdom was lifted off her feet as the exiled Prince pulled her into a tight embrace.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Keh! Look at her. In his arms like she hasn’t a care in the world.”</p>
<p>“’Ch. We shouldn’t allow this. We should take her away from here now.”</p>
<p>Venus  smiled tolerantly. “Now, Mars, that wouldn’t be very nice. Let’s give  them a moment. How different is this from our situation?”</p>
<p>Mars scowled. “Well, for starters, he isn’t under Metallia’s sway.”</p>
<p>“Maa. Then stop worrying. He’s just a harmless human male. Let’s give them a moment, shall we?”</p>
<p>The Martian turned to argue, but then stumbled to her knees and grabbed her head.</p>
<p><em>A  dark haired man reared forward and drew his blade. It caught the glint  of the early dawn light as it drew a graceful arc aimed for a blonde  haired woman who stood her ground unflinchingly.</em></p>
<p>“Rei!” Venus hissed, accustomed to the Martian’s body language. “Was it a premonition?</p>
<p>The  crimson warrior pulled herself back to her feet and blinked.  Premonitions had been few and far between, and after her experience  with Metallia’s influence in her head, she wasn’t sure <em>what</em> she could trust. “I… don’t know,” she spat, “I don’t know anything anymore.”</p>
<p>The  Venusian rested relieved hands on the Martian. It would do no good to  act on false or incomplete information, and Venus relaxed only when  Mars did; the crimson warrior’s shoulders slumping. Venus tore her eyes  from her Princess and the exiled Prince and gazed up at the sky. On the  lightening horizon, both the Moon and Venus shone brightly in the  pink-orange band that heralded the sun’s rise.</p>
<p>“They’re so close, the Moon and Venus.” Her voice was a whisper.</p>
<p>“Well, you <em>are</em> the leader of her guard and her closest confidante. It only makes  sense.” Mars’ voice was testy, even if the intent was to try to ease  her partner.</p>
<p>The Venusian tightened her grip around her sword’s  hilt and she turned introspective. Suddenly, it was she that needed  reassurance. “That only reinforces the feeling that everything we’re  doing, all of this, is predetermined. That we can’t stop or change  whatever evils are going to happen.”</p>
<p>Her gaze still solidly on  her Princess, Mars gently touched the small of Venus’ back. “The future  can always be changed if you try hard enough, Mina.”</p>
<p>Slowly, Venus loosened her grip on her sword and rested her head on Mars’ shoulder.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bare  feet sank into the soft sand of the garden path. Still dressed from the  night before, the Queen of the Earth walked in an aimless daze, a cup  of steaming coffee clutched between her long fingernails.</p>
<p>Sleep  had been elusive. Too much had ridden her mind. She had felt the link  between Metallia and Mars break with a resounding snap, and had known  that the lynch pin in her attack against the senshi had failed. The  citizens of Earth were a rallying force, eager to do her bidding, but  beyond her desire to crush the Moon Kingdom, she had no clear plan of  yet. Her shittenou were each tasked with different, often competing  projects, and there was still Endymion to think about, too. The  reluctant, exiled Prince roamed her halls with a forlorn expression.  She would banish him from her sight, had it not been for Metallia’s  insistence to keep him around.</p>
<p>’<em>She thinks I’ll agree to turn him dark, like I did the shitennou.’</em> It was a thought she often lamented, for it was an act she didn’t want to perform.</p>
<p>She  stopped then and took a generous sip of her black coffee. Her eyes were  drawn to the light growing on the horizon, to the orange-pink band of  sky that closely hugged the mountain range to the northwest. The moon’s  luminance was finally loosing to the light, fading into obscurity  behind the white topped peak of Mount Fuji, and towards the East, the  arced, orange rim of light that broke over the land heralded the dawn.</p>
<p>Morning’s  growing light banished some shadows, but created others. Contrasting  and conflicting shapes and shadows that didn’t belong in the garden  setting came better into view, and Beryl found herself choking on a  lump in her throat.</p>
<p>Her mug tumbled from her hands and landed in  the leafy loam at her feet with a soft thud, and the steaming contents  spilled forth, burning her toes. It was not for lack of want that she  did not cry out. In fact, she couldn’t find her voice at all. Instead,  she shuddered when a cold, dark ripple sent a shiver up her spine.</p>
<p>’<em>Quiet, you fool!’</em></p>
<p>Metallia froze her, and Beryl was helpless but to stare at the sight before her.</p>
<p>Under  the protection of the low canopy of a katsura tree, Endymion and  Serenity stood, their bodies twined together in an embrace. Their lips  were locked together, and they were seemingly oblivious to any  multitude of dangers that could be waiting for the exiled Prince and  the Princess of the Moon Kingdom who had wandered into hostile  territory.</p>
<p>‘<em>Brainwash him. Brainwash him, now, Beryl. See how  he flaunts his love for that worthless Moon female? And so boldly,  right in your own palace? Do not let this chance slip through your  fingers.’</em></p>
<p>The Queen of the Earth tried to turn, tried to  avert her gaze, tried anything she could to get the hated sight out of  her vision, but Metallia forced her to watch the two lovers, and no  amount of struggling would change that. She whimpered, her hands  shaking. It was not the first time she’d caught the two in such a  position, but every time she saw proof of Endymion’s love for Serenity,  it killed another piece of what little was left of her soul.</p>
<p>‘<em>Do it now, or I’ll do it for you.’</em></p>
<p>Beryl’s voice was a quiet hiss. “Don’t you lay a <em>finger</em> on him.” It was the first time she’d ever defied Metallia openly, but  Beryl would rather perform the task herself than let another so much as  touch the man she loved.</p>
<p>Tears streamed down her face. She  released the grip she held so tightly on Metallia’s powers that resided  deep inside her. Sensing her opportunity, that dark presence streamed  forth, released from Beryl personally, but being borne of Metallia’s  dark powers.</p>
<p>Beryl felt her precarious grip on her sanity waver,  and she wrestled with the surge of power that tried to escape her body,  barely managing to snap her controls back in place to allow only the  smallest amount of Metallia’s strength through. It would be enough to  brainwash Endymion, but it wouldn’t be enough to leave him emotionally  vacant.</p>
<p>‘<em>There’s no reversing the brainwashing, Beryl.’ </em>Metallia sneered in her head, displeased with her avatar’s actions.<em> ‘The Martian was an exception. Endymion is just a worthless human.’</em></p>
<p>Beryl  watched with clenched fists as Endymion went stiff in Serenity’s  embrace before collapsing to the soft ground. The look of shock and  fear on her face was a mirror image of the Princess’.</p>
<p>“Endymion!”  Serenity bent a knee to join her lover on the ground, but the man was  already pulling himself back up, his head bowed, his body pitched  forward.</p>
<p>Endymion stood awkwardly, and the small arms that were  quick to wrap around him went stiff. “Endymion?” Serenity’s voice  wavered. “Endymion… no…”</p>
<p>Those dark blue eyes grew cloudy, and finally, they turned pitch black.</p>
<p>The  next events happened in a dizzying blur. Endymion stepped back and drew  his sword. Serenity stood in shock before him, her eyes catching the  glint of light as the arcing blade reflected the light of the orange  glow of dawn. With an efficient speed, the blade descended, aiming for  the Princess of the Moon.</p>
<p>Mars rushed through the bushes, Venus  hot on her heels. The crimson warrior shoved her Princess aside and  caught Endymion’s blade with her own. It took two hands to steady her  strength against his, but the small woman gathered her stamina and  pushed him back.</p>
<p>Venus collected Serenity from the ground,  pulling the woman to her feet and shifting to stand in front of her  protectively, her sword held at the ready. The Princess clutched the  only slightly taller woman’s shoulders, her body racked with sobs as  she called out.</p>
<p>“Endymion, no! She wasn’t supposed to do this to you!”</p>
<p>Beryl  emerged from the shadows then, her tall body sauntering into view. Her  red eyes flashed in the pre-dawn light. Her voice was thick and flat.  “I didn’t do this to him, dear Serenity. <em>You</em> did this to him by trying to steal him from me.”</p>
<p>Serenity  gathered herself, tried to be defiant, but could only stifle a sob.  Beryl laughed, her unhinged voice forcing the birds in the trees above  to take to their wings. She took several deliberate steps forward,  until she stood alongside the object of her affection and rested a hand  on Endymion’s shoulder. The man didn’t so much as blink.</p>
<p>“How does it feel, my dear Princess, to be at fault for the destruction of this man’s soul?”</p>
<p>Mars’  brow furrowed. She shifted slightly, and her blade was no longer aimed  at Endymion, but at both him and Beryl at once. The Queen of the Earth  smirked at the crimson warrior.</p>
<p>“I know I failed with you, Mars.  But don’t think I won’t try again. You were a very enjoyable toy. But  now, I have another to occupy my time.” Her mouth was a crooked grin.  “Endymion, get them.”</p>
<p>With a frightening speed, the exiled Prince  swung his blade. Mars met the attack, but could only hope to defend  against strength like that. Her grip on her sword wavered as she  battled Endymion’s power and she turned her head over her shoulder  quickly.</p>
<p>“Run!” It was a simple direction, and all she could spare, and Venus recognized it for what it was.</p>
<p>The  golden warrior turned, her hands found Serenity’s shoulders, and she  pushed her Princess into motion. They didn’t have far to go; already,  she could see the shining beacon that was one of the Lunarian shuttles,  Jupiter’s personal craft, streaming its descent through the sky and  heading right for them.</p>
<p>The sound of swordplay, two heavy blades  slamming into each other mercilessly, fought with the scream of the  shuttle’s engine as its thrusters slowed its descent. Mars defended  against Endymion’s advances while slowly and methodically backing  herself away from Beryl and towards the safety of the landing shuttle.</p>
<p>The  door had no sooner opened when Venus pushed her charge into the craft.  Serenity collapsed to her knees on the floor, her small hands balled  into fists, tears steaming down her face. Venus ran forward and rushed  to Mars’ side. While the crimson warrior parried another attack, Venus  landed a vicious kick to Endymion’s stomach that had the man reeling  backwards.</p>
<p>The golden warrior stumbled backwards to the shuttle  and pushed Mars inside with a frantic heave before throwing herself  inside the opening as the door slid shut. Venus checked Mars over  quickly before turning her gaze to her grief stricken Princess. She  knew all too well what the young woman was going through. All too well.</p>
<p>“Good timing, Mako-chan, now get us the hell out of here!” Venus barked.</p>
<p>The  Venusian rested a reassuring hand on the Princess’ shoulder. No words  were needed. There was a simple understanding that passed between the  two women. Serenity nodded and pulled herself up to look out one of the  shuttle’s small windows. As the craft’s engines hit reverse and they  took to the air, Endymion looked up at the departing shuttle with  blank, dark eyes.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t save him.” Serenity sobbed. “I couldn’t save him.”</p>
<p>“You’ll find a way.” Venus said softly.</p>
<p>As they ascended into the light of dawn, the Princess of the Moon nodded with fierce determination and wiped away her tears.</p>
<hr />
<p>The hallway wasn’t good enough.</p>
<p>Venus  had established guard duty inside Princess Serenity’s antechamber. She  would allow her Princess the privacy of her bedroom, but without a  visual, she insisted on at least being able to <em>hear</em> where  Serenity was. The stricken woman was likely no longer a flight risk,  but the leader of the senshi wasn’t taking any chances.</p>
<p>Sitting  on the floor, Venus straightened her back against the door to the  bedroom and blinked her eyes, fighting against the lull of sleep. It  had been an exhaustingly long series of days, beginning with Metallia’s  capture of Mars, and ending with Endymion stuck in the same state.</p>
<p>“I can leave, if this makes you too comfortable.”</p>
<p>Venus chuckled at Rei’s quiet words and she shook her head. The Martian had <em>insisted</em> on taking guard duty with her, and Rei’s strong, quiet presence next to her was a boon to the Venusian.</p>
<p>After  their recon mission to Earth, and especially after the battle with  Metallia, Rei was reluctant to let either her charge or her lover out  of her sight for any extended period of time. She found herself pressed  against Venus’ side, content to know she was right there; in her vision  and in her senses. There was only one way they could be physically  closer, but such activities would have to wait. To take her mind off  such thoughts, she affected a distant expression, and concentrated on  other things.</p>
<p>It was some time later when Venus noticed her partner examining the soft skin of her forearms with no small amount of interest.</p>
<p>“What’cha thinking about?” She asked quietly, so as not to disturb their Princess.</p>
<p>Rei snorted, but didn’t turn her gaze from her arms. “It’ll sound stupid.”</p>
<p>“Try me.”</p>
<p>The Martian paused, considering. “I find it strange that even scars I acquired <em>before</em> I became a senshi have healed.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”  Venus said after a moment of thought. “That prayer ritual you  mentioned. You told me that the scars had been a part of a prayer for  good luck before going into a dangerous battle, right?”</p>
<p>“Un.” Rei finally met Venus’ gaze. “It’s strange to see such a part of myself missing.”</p>
<p>“It’s  still a part of you, Rei. Even if you can’t see it.” The Martian  affected a touched expression, and Venus laid a gentle hand over her  partner’s heart. “That Martian Priestess I met back on that red planet  is still <em>here</em>.”</p>
<p>With a small puff of breath, Rei allowed for a small, but honest smile before pulling the other woman closer to her.</p>
<p>Despite  the darkness that surrounded them, despite the desperate, uncertain  times, Venus clung to the many hopes she harbored, all while forming an  idea that might lift both their spirits.</p>

<p>Authors Notes:</p>
<p><em>No</em>.  I am not insinuating that Rei was into self-mutilation, and I’m talking  about the forearm, not the wrist. More on the prayer ritual in the next  chapter. Martians are pretty interesting, so trust me when I say it’ll  be a fun scene.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite chapters, so I’d love  to know what you guys think about. It. For me, I think it’s something  about the urgency in this chapter, and the fact that all the major  players play some role in that urgency that I like so much. Please  leave a review!</p>
<p>Special Thanks:<br />
  Neuro: Go ahead. Read the preview. You know you want to.<br />
  Bruteaous: Thank you. You leave the most wonderful reviews.<br />
  Mels:  You’re awesome. And thank you for the sketches. People, if you haven’t  read Mels’ stuff, check her out here on ffdotnet, and check out her  deviant art site. She’s got some great Rei/Minako stuff:<br />

  Vatta:  I know how difficult it can be to keep the many stories you’re reading  separated from one another. How do you think I feel when I’m <em>writing</em> three stories at one time?<br />
  Crimson  Blood: Thank you for your kind praise. I know the ‘dark senshi’ arc  tends to be cliché, but I’m glad you liked my take on it. There really  are so few original ideas left, but I stand firm on using standard plot  devices so long as you can write them well and keep them fresh!</p>

<p>Preview, Chapter 17: Prayer Ritual</p>
<p>Minako  and Rei charged into the room, panting and pale as though they’d  traveled far and unexpectedly and were dreading what awaited them.  Indeed, Minako had briefed Rei as best she could based on what little  she knew, but both women looked worried and confused. No explanation  was offered to their late arrival as they took their seats among the  rest of the senshi in the warriors’ courtyard.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to Pluto, who held a small, wrapped bundle to her chest.</p>
<p>Minako’s hand balled into a fist. “Is that-“</p>
<p>“Saturn.”  Pluto said. It was not lost on the others that the guardian of the time  gates was the only one clothed in her senshi fuku.</p>
<p>Pluto pulled  back the soft, purple cloth that shrouded Saturn’s form. The playful,  dark eyes of an infant peered at the many curious faces that gazed at  her, and she offered them a bright smile and a quiet gurgle.</p>
<p>Rei lifted an eyebrow at the child in Pluto’s arms. “<em>She’s</em> the one that heralds the powers of death and rebirth?”</p>
<p>Serenity stood with wide eyes. “The senshi of death and rebirth?”</p>
<p>Somehow,  the Martian didn’t know whether to be amused or worried that their  Princess seemed to know less about Saturn’s nature than she did.</p>
<p>Pluto  held her quiet bundle and offered Serenity a blank expression. “They  are Saturn’s given powers.” She explained. “She has the ability to  destroy planets, even solar systems if need be, but that power also has  a balance in an intrinsic ability to begin the cycle of rebirth.”</p>
<p>“Destroy and start anew.” Michiru’s voice was a distant whisper.</p>
<p>“Why have I not heard of her powers before?” Serenity demanded.</p>
<p>“Saturn is not a senshi to trifle with, Princess.” Haruka said gruffly.</p>
<p>“She only comes to us when the need for her arises.” Pluto said. “Her very existence would be too dangerous otherwise.”</p>
<p>Ami narrowed cold eyes on the outer senshi. “You are basically calling her a <em>tool</em>.”</p>
<p>The senshi of time turned empty, garnet eyes towards the Mercurian and the Princess. “That’s because she <em>is</em>.”</p>
