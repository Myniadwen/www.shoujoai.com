<pre>Rei&#39;s POV

Life...I could feel myself frown in thought. What did it mean to be 
alive? I breathe... my chest rises and falls with each soft inhale and 
exhale of air. I can see...my classmates dressed in our brightly colored 
uniforms, flaunting the red and brown colors. Sunlight pouring in 
through the back windows, the brown desks shined from previous polishing 
and there was a white board attached to a wall in the front of our room. 
I can hear...hear everyone&#39;s loud, annoying voices buzzing all around 
me! Oh, why do they have to be so loud? With one hand I pinched the 
bridge of my nose hoping to fight off the on coming headache. The 
fingers of my free hand drummed monotonously on my own desk. 
Touch...each tiny pressure was noted on the pads of my fingers. They 
followed one after another.

A girl walked by and in a flash my nose wrinkled slightly. Ugh, someone 
put on too much perfume. Who am I? Why do I bother try to figure out 
life? Living in this moment I am Hino Rei, female, with long, dark-raven 
hair, amethyst eyes and single. My eyes shot open at the last comment 
and a low growl emerged from the back of my throat. Why do I keep 
thinking of it? People live every day without thought of purpose; when 
we finally acknowledge the second we&#39;re living in it has already passed 
us. Whatever, its not like I&#39;m going to grow old anyway. Sailor senshi 
don&#39;t grow old, not with our long life spans. Sometimes it makes me 
regret being sailor mars reincarnate.

&quot;I...&quot; Testing the sound of my own voice tentatively. &quot;I wonder what 
Minako is doing right now...&quot; Letting it out with a sigh. Truth was, I 
felt sick. All morning I had the urge to puke, perhaps lack of sleep. 
Things have been so stressful lately. How I wish this day over with.

Minako&#39;s POV

The sun felt warm against my face, it feels nice in a pleasant sort of 
way. I was glad I could rest my head against the window still, class can 
be such a bore sometimes. My cerulean blue eyes watched the couples 
outside. They littered the grass in crowds at a time or they huddled 
together with clasped hands as they walked. . Spring tends to do this to 
people I observed. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if I could feel what they were 
feeling? However I&#39;ve been through this too many times. What&#39;s the point 
in falling in love only to lose your special person and be left behind 
in the end? Being the Goddess of Love, sailor venus reincarnate was 
indeed a blessing and a curse.

I sighed once more, willing my eyes to move away from the happy couples 
and searched the blue sky for answers. Instead I found myself thinking 
how the clouds look so white and fluffy, making me wish I were back in 
my comfy bed. One cloud that shuffled by reminded me a lot of Usagi. It 
looked like an adorable rabbit. My thoughts were interrupted with the 
abrupt ringing of the bell.

&quot;Thank Kami!&quot;

In a flash I was out of that stuffy classroom. My mind had only on one 
thought, meeting Rei. Before I knew it I was outside, practically 
jumping out of the school&#39;s front entrance. My eyes squinted and peered 
all around the mass of students trying to pin point the fire senshi. 
Almost like trying to find a needle in a haystack. There was a flash of 
raven hair. Rei! I thought. I finally spotted her. She was there, 
standing underneath a tall, lush green leafed tree, across from the 
swarming crowd.

&quot;Rei!&quot; I called, running to her.

She lifted her head from the book she was reading and smiled. It was 
great to see a friend. But...something was different about her 
today...she looked pale.

&quot;What&#39;s up Mina chan?&quot;

&quot;The usual.&quot; I huffed, trying to catch my breath. &quot;I don&#39;t see how you 
can like all this business stuff Rei, how do you ever stay awake?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s useful that&#39;s why.&quot; She replied. There was laughter in her eyes. 
Wow, you usually don&#39;t see that everyday, she&#39;s usually so serious. 
&quot;Besides Mina chan, I did agree to take the vocal class with you if you 
took my business course. So we&#39;re even.&quot;

&quot;I guess so.&quot; I managed to grin.

Rei wanted to go into business and I wanted to go into the musical and 
vocal course. In the end we decided to take each other&#39;s course as well 
as our own so we&#39;d get to see at least one person we knew. Unfortunately 
it was required that we&#39;d take a third course as an extra curricular 
activity, separating us for one block a day.

&quot;Rei, do you want to be my partner for our music project?&quot;

&quot;Mina chan, who else could put up with you?&quot;

Oh, burn. I felt that one, feeling myself wince.

No way was she going to get away with that. I walked up close to her, 
trying for my best seductive smile. When I leaned in she tried to step 
back but I took hold of her receding hand, stopping her movement. She 
looks so surprised, that look on her face is so cute, almost like a 
shocked child. It felt great to be the one in control here. There was a 
slight tingling feeling when our hands touched, it surprised me how good 
it felt to feel her warmth...wait, what am I thinking? I&#39;m supposed to 
be getting even! Continuing where I left off my lips brushed past her 
face and I whispered into her ear,

&quot;I suppose you could?&quot;

Settling my head onto her shoulder I let myself rest, feeling the soft 
fabric of the school uniform she wore. My arms wrapped themselves 
loosely around her waist for balance. Taking in a deep breath I noticed 
she was wearing a different perfume...I would&#39;ve asked what it was but I 
felt myself distracted. She was shaking...

Rei&#39;s POV

She caught me off guard. Seeing that smile of hers, my knees almost 
buckled...I don&#39;t know why it made me feel this way. To my horror she 
leaned in. Kami, my eyes widened and my heart skipped a beat... she&#39;s 
getting too close. Unconsciously I tried to step back to avoid a 
possible contact when she grasped my hand in hers. A small electric 
shock raced through my body upon contact. There wasn&#39;t much time to 
contemplate what that shock was, Mina was getting closer! To my surprise 
I was half relieved and disappointed when she brushed past my face only 
to feel myself break out into a bright blush when she whispered,

&quot;I suppose you could?&quot; A warm flow of air hit my ear, causing me to 
shudder.

I almost jumped when her head rested on my left shoulder. It was 
uncomfortable but in a good way. Time seemed to stop. Everything felt so 
warm and comforting...I didn&#39;t notice but it was suddenly it was harder 
to breath. I could only gulp as lungs took sharp intakes of oxygen. 
Silently I hoped Mina didn&#39;t hear it. Why did I feel this way? This 
wasn&#39;t something I was used to, sure I&#39;d hug my friends all the time but 
this felt...different. If I hugged her now I had a feeling that I 
wouldn&#39;t want to let go. Damn these emotions! They never made any sense. 
I needed to get out of here, anywhere but here...a place far from her. 
My thoughts were whirling at 100km/h, my vision... everything started to 
whirl around me. No, I can&#39;t faint! My fists clenched together tightly, 
hoping the pain would keep me conscious. A cool hand felt my forehead, 
causing me to snap out of my trance.

&quot;Mina chan?&quot;

Mina was staring at me with a concerned look on her face. Did I really 
look that bad? When did she leave my shoulder?

&quot;Rei chan, are you all right?&quot;

I couldn&#39;t answer her... my mind drew a blank. I opened my mouth but no 
words came out, my throat felt so dry.

&quot;You&#39;re sweating Rei chan.&quot; She whispered, taking in my form with her 
eyes. &quot;Rei chan!&quot;

The last thing I heard was her shouting my name.

Minako&#39;s POV

I forced myself not to panic. Somehow I managed to catch Rei before she 
hit the ground. Did she have some kind of cold? I knew she looked pale 
but I didn&#39;t think it was this bad. The miko was always the most health 
conscious of our circle of friends; it just came as a surprise that 
she&#39;d push herself this hard. Honestly, she shouldn&#39;t have come to 
school today if she was ill. My hand felt her forehead once more, 
brushing away the bangs from her face. She&#39;s burning up... Quickly I 
called a cab with my cell phone and had us taken us to the nearest 
possible place, my apartment.

&quot;Mom, I&#39;m home!&quot; I pushed open the door with my legs, Rei&#39;s limp body 
lay in my arms.

&quot;Minako, what the-?&quot; She stopped.

&quot;Rei collapsed at school. I&#39;m going to put her in my bed. Would you 
please get me a cool towel and a bowl of cold water? She&#39;s burning up.&quot;

My mom nodded her head weakly and walked to the kitchen to gather what I 
had requested. Sometimes she can really jump to conclusions, I mean 
really! Her face said it all. I looked down to the unconscious senshi of 
fire in my arms. Even when slept she had such a serious look on her 
face, can&#39;t she relax even a little? A small smirk crossed my features. 
Moments later I was in my room. Gently I laid Rei onto the bed, resting 
her on her back and pulled the covers over her heated body. I sat beside 
the bed on my knees trying to shift into a comfortable position.

&quot;Mom! Did you get the towel yet?&quot; I yelled.

The small woman came a few minutes later, scowling under her breath at 
my impatience.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; I muttered, responding to her scowl. She watched me take the 
towel and spread it evenly over Rei&#39;s sweaty brow. The way her eyes bore 
into me shifted my worried mood to annoyance. What was she judging me 
for? I had nothing to hide. &quot;What is it?&quot; I snapped.

She stood there fumbling with her hands, looking down at the floor, 
fidgeting slightly. Was she nervous? A wave of guilt hit me.

&quot;Look...I&#39;m sorry. But really, what did you want to talk about?&quot; I tried 
more gently.

&quot;Minako...your... father died.&quot;

I blinked. The father that divorced my mother when I was a child? That 
so called father? Rage started to build up within my chest, slowly 
spreading down to my clenching fists. Kami, I barely remember him, 
should I feel sad? I studied my mother&#39;s face. There were a few tears 
that had already started to trickle down her cheeks. How could she feel 
something for him still when I felt nothing but hate? He abandoned her 
for another woman!

She seemed to misunderstand my silence for sadness because the next 
thing I knew she had embraced me in a hug, whispering words of comfort 
that were really meant for her. Reluctantly I wrapped my arms around her 
skinny frame. The blond hairs on her head were turning grey. She wasn&#39;t 
that old, only a bit over forty-three. I suppose sleepless nights and 
days of starving yourself could turn you into what she was now...a 
broken woman.

&quot;I&#39;m all right mom...&quot; I tried to comfort her. She continued to sob 
longer, in need of human warmth.

&quot;T-they&#39;re...having ...the... f-funeral in England.&quot; She mumbled at 
last. &quot;I&#39;m going.&quot;

For a moment I couldn&#39;t say anything. A silence echoed through the room. 
Did she say she was going to a funeral for that idiot? Something made me 
want to scream at her and bring her to her senses but I didn&#39;t, I 
couldn&#39;t. She had really loved him and nothing I would say could change 
that. Her true love...that wasn&#39;t returned. Is this how things are 
supposed to work? Sometimes love was a joke. It left me feeling bitter.

&quot;If you want to go, then go...&quot; I managed in a calm voice. She looked up 
with tear filled eyes. &quot;It&#39;s all right, I can manage by myself.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t going to go?&quot; She asked frowning slightly. At least she 
wasn&#39;t bawling anymore. There was a hint of disbelief in her voice.

&quot;Mom...&quot; My eyes steeled. &quot;Gomen ne, I just...can&#39;t. Please try to 
understand, I...I just can&#39;t.&quot; My eyes looked down to the floor away 
from hers. She seemed to feel the inner turmoil I struggled with.

&quot;Besides, Rei can help me if anything happens.&quot;

My mom peered over at Rei, still unconscious. One eyebrow raised 
sarcastically.

&quot;When she&#39;s better.&quot; I quickly corrected myself. Rei had always been 
there for me. She&#39;s my best friend after all. &quot;In the meantime why don&#39;t 
you pack and get ready to go? It wouldn&#39;t do any justice to wait till 
the last minute.&quot;

&quot;Minako...&quot;

I grasped my mother&#39;s shoulders, staring straight into her eyes now. I 
wanted her to see my resolution, that I would not go but I had no 
objection to her leaving. She sighed.

&quot;You&#39;re right...you&#39;ve grown so much my dear Minako. You know, I will 
always love you, no matter what.&quot;

There was pride in her voice... it made me feel taller inside. Very few 
times had she ever acknowledged me since father left. That old man might 
have been jealous if he were here now. After saying her bit she made her 
way quickly from the room and out the apartment door. The outside door 
closed with a slight thud and a click followed indicating it had been 
locked. Knowing my mother, she&#39;d take at least a couple hours shopping 
for supplies. That was one thing that never changed, once she made up 
her mind she&#39;d wouldn&#39;t change it for the world...unfortunately he meant 
more than the world to her. I was surprised that she didn&#39;t die of a 
heart attack from the news. That was the kind of woman she was, although 
she was strong she was also human.

&quot;M-mina...&quot;

&quot;Rei chan?&quot;

I turned back towards the bed to see Rei was mumbling something...she 
looked like she was in great pain. One of my hands touched the towel on 
her forehead. I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised that the towel had already 
dried but I was. I cursed myself for forgetting her in that one moment. 
Taking it in my hands I dipped it into a bowl of cool water and plopped 
it back onto her brow. With the knuckle of my right index finger I 
brushed it softly against her cheeks. They were so red. It was hard to 
believe that it was Rei that lay helpless before me. No. I shook my 
head, Rei isn&#39;t weak...she would fight in this condition if she had to. 
My mind wandered back to our senshi fighting days. There were many times 
where Rei fought despite her condition. Times where our team needed her 
the most, she was always there for us.

Rei chan...I looked to the sleeping fire senshi again. It pained me to 
remember the times she had gotten hurt from my careless instructions 
when I first was adjusting to being the inner senshi leader. One time in 
particular she almost died shielding me. But those days were over...both 
of us are here now, alive, living almost ordinary lives.

I never noticed when I had sat myself down on the edge of the bed. The 
soft orange quilt was lightly wrapped Rei&#39;s fidgeting form. Fidgeting? 
When I leaned in closer my eyes noticed that she was shivering slightly. 
Was she cold? But her fever made her feel so warm.

&quot;Mina...&quot;

She had said something else but I couldn&#39;t hear. Carefully, making sure 
none of my long blond locks touched her face I supported myself over her 
with my arms either side of her sleeping presence. My head tiled to one 
side as I listened intently to her fevered rambling.

&quot;Mina...chan...it hurts.&quot; I froze. There was nothing but pain was in her 
voice. She felt so far away, my heart ached, wanting to take it all 
away.

Then there was a tiny tug on my hair. I wasn&#39;t aware of it at first but 
one of Rei&#39;s hands had buried itself in between my blond strands. She 
was crying...Kami, she&#39;s crying. That was the last straw, I couldn&#39;t 
hold myself back anymore. I allowed myself to fall carefully onto my 
back beside her. There was enough space on the bed so I would not fall 
off. Protectively my right arm snaked under her neck then around the 
outline to the far side of her body while the other reached across my 
waist to clasp my other hand, pulling Rei close to my body. Words of 
comfort left my mouth constantly. She responded by rolling in my grip 
and snuggled up tight against me, her head on top of my shoulder by my 
face. I lifted my head up slightly and pulled her closer till her head 
rested in the crook of my neck before I allowed my head to rest onto 
hers. Almost immediately I heard her breathing slow to a steady rhythm. 
A sigh of relief escaped my lips. It didn&#39;t matter if I got sick... if 
it meant Rei would get better that was all that mattered.

&quot;Only for a little bit...&quot; I whispered to her. My free hand brushed away 
the raven bangs from her face again.

My eyelids started to droop. So much had happened today, I was mentally 
exhausted. Before I knew it I had fallen asleep as well.
