<h1>Rising Like Ember</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/monikku.html">Monikku</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  This story is written in a poetry form, with little regard for proper
  use of grammar. Poetic license was especially taken in the form of
  sentence structure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    As two planets in a sea of stars, distinct and separate from the
universe at hand; they stood opposite sides of the room.

    Tracing the mouth of her fluted glass with a delicate finger,
playing on it&#39;s sensibilities as though the movement would draw forth
the sweet liquid held within by sheer will; she brings it to her full,
pink lips. Waves and curls of aqua hair falling from her face as she
tips her head back, exposing a savory neck, waiting to be tasted. Her
skin, porcelain, fair. She has a glow, mystical and ravishing.
Slowly lowering the glass; her shield, her weapon. Her actions are
deliberate; peeking over its rim with luminous blue eyes, carefully
spying her prey.

    Snared.

    Short sandy blonde hair. The woman&#39;s bangs warily exposing dark,
smoldering green eyes. A knowing look plays upon her features, as if
she held all of the world&#39;s secrets. Wearing a woolen, dark grey suit;
she is handsome and she knows it. Her stance is both inviting and
inhibiting, right hand in her pant&#39;s pocket. She is chatting idly with
an adoring face, a devilish smirk on the blonde&#39;s lips meant to toy.
But she is captivated, mesmerised by the blue eyed vision.

    Casually, she glances. Not wanting to show her hand too soon, she
is losing the hard fought battle for dominance. The blonde&#39;s usual
confident demeanor is becoming overshadowed by desire, and she finds
herself consumed.

    Their eyes meet.

    Blue and green,
    tight together
    like flesh and bone,
    like mad lovers.

    Flush.

    Tearing personas, facades, false securities like fabric, like
stubborn clothing. A penetrating gaze, leaving both shivering cold,
vulnerable and exposed.

    Gravity taking its course. Pulling the two into one another&#39;s
revolution, making escape impossible.

    The aqua haired beauty sets her glass on a table. Taking those
first few steps towards her destiny. Her light blue, form fitting
dress, silky and flowing, eyes glimmering with determination. She
bypasses her obstacles, the fools in her path whispering sweet
nothings. All yearning for her affections.

    Her undeniable connection.

    All she can see is green.

    The blonde makes her own path through the crowd. Through her hurt
and suffering, her fear and sacrifice. Feeling the force of a thousand
tons, her legs moving of their own accord. She is being pulled in.
Faithless but yearning, frightened but ready.

    As they draw closer, the blue eyed woman&#39;s hips sway, like sudden
waves in a calm ocean. The wind having its way, coaxing the sea to
rise and fall... they find themselves breathing for one another.
Inhaling and exhaling hoping to take each other in.

    Both unaware as to who initiates it, the first touch is rapturous.

    The blonde puts her hands around the smaller, more feminine woman&#39;s
waist. The smaller woman, throws her smooth, soft arms around the
other&#39;s neck.

    Both ready to redefine their existences with a breath, with a kiss.

    The smaller woman raises her head with grace known only by angels
and the demons who covet them. Gently, she presses her lips to the
taller woman&#39;s ear. And with a voice stirring in the very depths of
the Green eyed woman&#39;s soul, utters such simple words.

    &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;
