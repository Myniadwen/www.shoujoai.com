<p><strong>WARNING!:</strong> I never told you I was going to make it easy for you readers... so...  in this chapter Jade features and you now know he's not a  tender-hearted guy, so... some not-too-gentle lines by him - he's a  gross, rude lag, after all. But nothing you're not going to hear from  your TV every single day.</p>

<strong>Tokyo  airport, 9.20 AM.</strong>
<p><em>The  hall was busy, people leaving and coming. Every sort of people. Most  of them on business trips, he was sure of that. Briefcases and suits  were everywhere, even some celebrities judging by the commotion of  bawling girls and camera flashlights. He walked around for a moment  then decided to sit down at a café table. He felt some kind of  exhaustion but he was perfectly conscious it couldn't be just  physical: he had had his eight-hours-long sleep, and his job at the  arcade his parents owned wasn't such a hard work. He used to spend  his time behind the counter or in the back fixing computers or every  sort of device. But he did feel very tired... tired of traveling  around, tired of worrying, tired of preparing himself to every sort  of bad news every time the phone rang or the postman stopped by their  house.</em></p>
<p><em>He  slumped down on the white chair and exhaled a sigh, then he looked  around just to distract himself from his brooding attitude. His  attention was immediately got by an enthusiastic comment about the  biggest ice-cream he had ever seen by a nearby table where an  American couple was sitting. He soon turned still smiling at the  blonde girl's behavior. At another table on his right was a beautiful  tanned woman in her thirties with a lilac elegant suit and a laptop  opened in front of her. She seemed very engrossed in her work, her  eyes didn't blink and rarely she lifted her head looking around as to  search for someone.</em></p>
<p><em>Furuhata  stared at her, 'They're all the same... they travel cause of their  job, they work while they're traveling and they'll work when they'll  arrive. They all work so much to afford the house-of their-dreams  where the family-of-their-dreams would live and where they can't  enjoy the life-of-their-dreams cause they're too busy working to  afford all of that...' He thought bitterly, then he thought of  himself, he sure wasn't like them, he liked his job but he wasn't a  workaholic... 'But again I'm always traveling around the world... and  it sure isn't for fun.' He thought about all the airports he had seen  in his quite short life so far. 'I should stop running every time...  but I promised...' He looked away when the tanned woman's garnet eyes  pierced through him intensely. </em></p>
<p><em>He  then leaned back in the white chair sighing, there was still time to  wait before his flight, he tried to wait patiently the way he always  did... but his hand on its own will crept into his pocket and pulled  out a creased sheet of paper, he unfolded the sheet and again – for  what... the hundredth time? - before him was the nervous black  handwriting, it wasn't the first letter like that he received...  '...but this time... it's different...' He traced the dried stains  with his fingers, obviously caused by salty drops fallen on the paper  as it was written, '...or not?'</em></p>

<strong>Four  days later, a completely different place.</strong>
<p>&quot;We can't leave the beach! How the  Hell can they spot us if we're not on the beach?&quot; Seiya's heated  reply aroused many comments in the small group. They were all  gathered to decide what to do after the news Haruka had given them  about the spring she had found in the forest. She had told them about  the caves too and now some of them wanted to move there to have  shelter and water at will without the long walk.</p>
<p>&quot;But there we could get refuge from  the rain, too. Ami and Umino say the raining season has just begun...  we all witnessed it yesterday.&quot; Darien reasoned. Some comments  of agreement spread through the small community though not all of  them had the same opinion.</p>
<p>&quot;I  have plenty of shelter here, so do whatever you want, I don't care.&quot;  Jade said, then he turned his back to them and made his way to his  quite comfy spot. Lita shot a deadly glare at his back and grunted  something about him having 'hoarded up everything that wasn't a  corpse!'.</p>
<p>They  all looked at him for a moment then there was a general shrugging and  they went back to their discussion. It was hard to find a common  decision and after a quite long consultation they were in stalemate.  A larger group agreed about moving to the caves, but some of them  were resolved to stay at the beach with the hope to be seen by a  passing ship sooner or later.</p>
<p>&quot;I  have no intention to become cannon fodder for that... that... <em>thing</em> in the forest!&quot; And with that Yaten left the group, his decision  clear.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...  actually...&quot; Dr. Mizuno intervened, &quot;when we made the  autopsy the evidence is that the poor girl was attacked at the beach,  she had sand under her nails.&quot; This new information was greeted  differently, some were shocked, others angry for the omitted detail  and others were quite fatalist.</p>
<p>&quot;If  we have to be devoured by that thing... at least we can have some  chance to be spotted...&quot; Lita concluded and she stepped aside to  make clear she had taken her decision.</p>
<p>Looking  at her worried, Mina said, &quot;We should stay together...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...  we should.&quot; Serena agreed quite worried too, Darien squeezed her  shoulders with his arm.</p>
<p>Haruka  looked at all of that like it was some kind of show... she felt like  they were far from her. It was difficult for her to concentrate on  the discussion, her head throbbed really painfully and her sight was  blurry. She remained silent without participating until she was asked  directly about her intentions. Mina's voice reached her as if muffled  and she wasn't able to reply immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka?&quot;  it was the second time the younger girl called for her... or was it  the third?</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka-san,  are you all right?&quot; This time the soft voice rang clearly in her  ears and the gentle touch of that hand on her arm was scorching.  Haruka winced and that took Michiru by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;I...&quot;  The car-racer spoke finally out of her dazed state, &quot;I'll move  to the caves, it's the better thing to do, water is too important.&quot;</p>
<p>Then  it was clear: the little community was split in two parties. Taiki  had obviously decided to remain at the beach with Yaten, it hadn't  been much of a hard decision for him; Molly had been long uncertain  cause of the possibility the doctor could move, but finally she had  agreed about Ami or her mother visiting her almost daily and of  course Umino had decided to stay... well... wherever she wanted to  stay; Lita had decided mainly to be able to keep an eye on Jade  despite what she had just said; Furuhata too had chosen to stay  saying that moving to the hinterland was like giving up all hope to  be rescued, and while saying that he had looked at Haruka  significantly; last of them Seiya had decided to remain with his  brothers wanting to renew some kind of relationship with them. Of  course almost all of them had justified their decision with different  excuses from the real ones, but for everyone it was clear sincerity  wasn't something valuable in that situation. They were, after all, a  bunch of strangers.</p>
<p>Darien,  Serena and Mina had agreed immediately to remain together, then they  had decided it was more reasonable to be where the water was; for the  doctor and her daughter it had been an almost inescapable choice, it  was almost impossible to do their job without available water; Rei's,  Grandpa's and Yuiichiro's consultation had  been longer cause the girl had had to translate their conversation  but in the end the old man had suggested them to move to be able to  have food and water and a shelter cause those were the important  things right off; Setsuna had been quite annoyed by the fact she had  been asked before Haruka or Michiru, she knew she wanted to be where  they were at least for Hotaru's sake, but a rapid exchange of glances  with the tall blonde made her decide it was safer for Hotaru to be  where the doctor was and of course Haruka wanted to be with them, if  they had decided to stay she would have decided so in the end too,  but that she never said out loud.</p>
<p>They  were split in two and in the middle stood Michiru. She realized she  hadn't decided and now all eyes were on her. Of course she was used  to have the attention drawn to her and were not all the eyes to make  her uncomfortable. 'And now? I have to decide...' she thought looking  from one line-up to the other and soon she found herself looking from  Seiya's expecting eyes, to Haruka's cold ones. She sure wanted to  stay with Hotaru and, despite what she was trying to convince herself  of, she would have liked to stay with Haruka too. On the other hand  she looked at Seiya and the hope in his eyes, he was in a very  difficult situation and Michiru was the only one still close to him.  She now knew what his feelings for her were and she also knew that  she could have chosen to move and in the end he would have followed  her turning the situation ideal for her... but that would have been  selfish on her part, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>'Then  don't move...' Her inner voice told her, '...or maybe you really want  to go with... her?' Michiru knew her conscience didn't intend just  Hotaru but tried to ignore it.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan?&quot;  Seiya prompted her in an intimate way in Japanese like it was  something between the two of them only. She looked once again to  Haruka, she could tell something was bothering the taller woman cause  she was stiff and her eyes were cold like she was on the defensive.  Michiru had already figured out the blonde didn't like to show her  feelings and that coldness could hide so many things... but right  then her own heart was so mixed up that she could have used some  clear signal her presence was welcome... and the only clear signal  she was seeing at that right moment was the hope in Seiya's eyes. He  was what she needed right then, wasn't he?</p>
<p>Seiya's  face fell when the aqua-haired beauty walked from him and towards the  car-racer, but he remained silent clenching his fists... oh how he  hated that woman!</p>
<p>&quot;Can  I talk with you?&quot; Michiru said when she was right in front of  Haruka, her look serious and her voice pain-filled.</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course...&quot; Haruka replied slightly confused.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>Dear  Fu-chan,</em>
<p><em>I  know it's been a while... a </em>long<em> while. I know I should ask you how is it going there? And Mama and  Papa? I know I should ask you about some kind of a girlfriend cause  it's time for you to settle down with a good girl, you deserve  that...</em></p>
<p><em>...but  I'm not going to ask you that... I know it could look like I don't  care, but it's not the case, it's just that... well... it's just that  I'm afraid of the answers cause I think I already know them.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes...  I already know Mom cries often and she often talks about me, and I  know Papa stays silent when it happens but he clenches his teeth and  frowns with that painful look in his eyes, the same he always had  when I was caught in some kind of trouble... I'd like to hear you  have finally found a good girl but I'm afraid you'll tell me you  haven't one, and it scares me cause I'll think it's because you're  too busy worrying about your hopelessly-loser-of-a-sister, the one  that calls for you in tears and makes you jump and run to her  wherever in the world she is... even in the middle of a romantic  date. I know this sound lame and stupid but you know... maybe I am...  lame and stupid.</em></p>
<p><em>Well,  like always I wrote down tons of shit... I don't want you to feel  sorry for me but like you can see I can't help but be selfish...  sometimes I think the only thing preventing me from feeling  completely self-concentrated is my love for you. Yes, dear brother,  you know you are the only pure thing in my life, the only thing I can  look at and feel like I'm something worth living.</em></p>
<p><em>I  remember once, when we were just kids I was lost in the wood and I  was crying helplessly when you found me and with a smile you said to  me:&quot;Why are you crying Una-chan? Don't tell me you've thought I  abandoned you... You know I can't be without you onee-chan... I'll  always find you and bring you back with me, never doubt that.&quot;  We were just 8 or 9 but you were already so mature...</em></p>
<p><em>Fu-chan,  now it's cause of that promise I'm writing to you... I know I called  for you so many times I can't remember the exact number... and I know  I have no rights but... </em>Wet  stain<em> I feel like I'm going to get lost </em>Wet  stain<em> My life is slipping away through my finger and I  can't get an hold of it. </em>Wet  stain <em>I'm loosing my path and I don't know if you can  bring me back this time...</em></p>
<p>Wet  stain<em>Well... I wa</em>Wet  stain<em>nted to be sure you knew I love you with all my heart  and soul and that you've always been with me, all the time... and  that you will always be.</em></p>
<p>Wet  stain</p>
<p><em>Yours</em></p>
<p><em>Unazuki</em></p>

Furuhata  looked at the group while they were still discussing the details  about their leaving to the caves in the hinterland. Then he looked  back at his own spot where he used to work on the radio devices...  yes, he was absolutely certain about his decision, no matter what the  others thought or said he wouldn't have given up his hopes. So he  waved to the others and was soon back working cause he had something  important to get ready to do that day. He cast another quick glance  to the secluded spot where Haruka-san and Michiru-san were talking  then turned to his makeshift table and his scanty tools and was soon  engrossed in the last adjustments.
<p>Meanwhile  Michiru had drawn Haruka aside from the others, the blonde seemed a  little confused and Michiru could tell she was a little nervous too.  The aqua-haired woman sighed deeply and looked up into Haruka's teal  eyes for a while. She had never let go of the blonde's hand and then  took the other one into hers as well. Haruka's surprise and confusion  was clear cause she looked dumfounded down at their joined  extremities.</p>
<p>&quot;I...&quot;  Michiru couldn't talk resolutely like she had planned to, Haruka's  look affected her in ways she was afraid to acknowledge. Her hands  were so cold she was almost trembling while Haruka's were hot and it  seemed to her they were burning where she was holding them. She  looked down too and it seemed weird for her to see her fingers  holding those hands so much larger than hers  and not the other way  round.</p>
<p>Haruka  had already figured out Michiru wasn't about to tell her anything  good, she couldn't admit it to herself immediately but she was afraid  she was about to stay at the beach. That thought was greeted in her  mind by a painful throb of her head. She was already cold and  Michiru's icy hands' touch gave her a shiver she couldn't stifle.</p>
<p>That  unintentional move broke the spell and they were out of that dazed  state, or at least Michiru was. She sighed again and tried to speak,  this time her voice didn't fail her anymore.</p>
<p>&quot;I  want to ask you a favor...&quot; She said looking the blonde again in  the eyes, now the previous coldness had disappeared to be replaced by  a twirling mix of emotion unusually showing off clearly. She sensed  it wasn't a good thing, though she had often complained inwardly for  the blonde's reserve that made her unreadable most of the times, but  now she could tell something was wrong... but what?</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;  Michiru was ripped out of her thoughts by Haruka's voice. &quot;What's  this favor you need?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...  sure... well, I wanted to ask you to bring Hotaru here at the beach  every time you have the chance and I'll promise to come to the cave  and visit her whe-...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  can't stay here!&quot; Haruka's voice raised as she cut the violinist  off.</p>
<p>&quot;Please  Haruka-san... I think Furuhata-kun and Seiya-kun are right... What  chance we have to be spotted if we move from the beach?&quot; She  told her calmly though the blonde seemed anything but calm.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  nonsense!&quot; She pulled her hands free from Michiru's and clenched  her fists as her voice raised even more.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka-san  I made my decision... I know Hotaru is safer with the doctor and...  and <em>you</em> at her side so I'm unworried, but I have to stay-...&quot;  She was again cut off by the blonde's hoarse voice.</p>
<p>&quot;They  won't come! No one will ever come!&quot; Haruka said with such fervor  that she was panting now.</p>
<p>&quot;How  can you be so sure? They're searching for us right now and-...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cause  they're searching in the wrong place!&quot; Haruka was almost  yelling, but fortunately they were far enough from the others to be  just seen but not overheard.</p>
<p>&quot;Why  the Hell would they searching in the wrong place and why do you know  such a thing?&quot; Michiru too was starting to be worked up by that  conversation, she sensed it was leading them nowhere good.</p>
<p>Haruka  was irrationally angry, she knew her voice was raising every passing  minute and that they could end up being overheard by the others, at  the same time all that conversation was coming to her like from a  distance, sound and images distant and quite blurry, even Michiru who  was not more than a meter away seemed so small and far she couldn't  have been able to touch her with her arm stretched out.</p>
<p>Those  considerations took a moment and the delay of an answer was getting  on Michiru's nerve. &quot;Are you going to give me an answer or have  you decided on your own this conversation's over?&quot; Michiru  looked at the blonde and saw the blank look in her eyes like she had  spaced out.</p>
<p>Haruka's  head throbbed painfully and she couldn't think lucidly, she shook it  a couple of times trying to gain back some clearness of mind, but it  only made things worse cause the beach and Michiru started spinning.</p>
<p>Michiru  saw the blonde shaking her head and then stumbling slightly, she  noticed she was also trembling, frowning Michiru leaned forward  trying to reassure the other but Haruka moved back.</p>
<p>Everything  in Haruka's head cried for her to follow the violinist's  unintentional advice and end the conversation there and then, but  before she could think about it she found the words slipping out of  her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Cause  the pilot said it to us... we were thousands miles out of path when  we crashed! That's why! No one knows where we are...&quot; This time  Michiru didn't noticed the feverish look in Haruka's teal eyes, she  was busy processing that information.</p>
<p>The  silence that followed was heavy, Haruka had regained enough lucidity  to realize what she had done and instinctively looked down in shame,  all the heat leaving her spirit and body too, she shivered in  coldness.</p>
<p>&quot;I  can't believe it, Haruka... you did it again.&quot; The incredulous  look turned into a disappointed and hurt one. &quot;You promised not  to lie to me anymore...&quot;</p>
<p>The  ocean-blue eyes before her watered rapidly and soon big tears were  running down that beautiful face, but not once Michiru looked away  from Haruka, no sob broke their eye-contact, no sound, no move.  Haruka was completely petrified not able to shift a muscle, she knew  she had done something terrible, she knew it had been her to bring  tears to those eyes... Right now she knew lots of things but she  couldn't remember how to speak... she wanted to explain Michiru why  she had kept that information from her, but she found out she  couldn't.</p>
<p>Michiru  too was motionless, the cold expression in her eyes didn't match the  rage swirling inside her like a whirlpool and threatening to erupt  outside. But she couldn't allow such a thing... she was Kaioh  Michiru, she was a lady and she didn't want to make a scene more than  what they had already done... she felt like she had already given  Haruka too much power on her, the power of affecting her feelings so  much... and it had been a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>So,  with a very lady-like swirl, Michiru turned her back to the taller  woman and walked away to the beach her wet cheeks shimmering in the  morning sun. Just then Seiya, having watched the scene from afar with  the others, was marching there and when he got a glimpse of Michiru  crying he soon rushed at Haruka.</p>
<p>The  car-racer didn't acknowledged him at first still dumfounded by the  recent discussion and its consequences, when Seiya shook her with a  strong hold on her shirt collar pain rushed through her body starting  from her head and then she focused her look on him. She covered his  hands with her owns and twisted his wrists until he let go of her  with a yelp of pain then she shoved him off and he stumbled back a  couple of meters.</p>
<p>&quot;What  have you done to her?!&quot; He yelled and was about to dash at her  again when two strong arms held him in place</p>
<p>&quot;Seiya!  Seiya are you crazy?! Stop it!&quot; It was Taiki who had preceded  the others drawn by commotion and curiosity.</p>
<p>&quot;Let  go of me, damnit!&quot; The younger man struggled and managed to free  himself from his brother's hold and again he was face to face with  the tall blonde. Meanwhile the others had run there and Darien,  Yuiichiro and Yaten wanted to intervene but they were too slow and  Seiya was again at Haruka's collar, this time with one hand high in  the air ready to punch her right in the face.</p>
<p>&quot;I  knew you were nothing good!&quot; He hissed and blew his strike,  Haruka ducked just out of instinct, the rush of adrenaline suddenly  clearing her blurred mind. &quot;What have you done to her?!&quot; He  repeated.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  none of your business!&quot; She replied, her rage rising like a  storm inside.</p>
<p>&quot;It  is <em>so</em> my business! It's my Michi-chan you're talking about,  you bastard!&quot;</p>
<p>At  this point Haruka exploded, the anger she felt inside was something  familiar and at the same time completely new. She didn't like him, he  was arrogant and annoying and it was easy to feel like beating him up  until that smug expression on his face was completely gone, this was  what she would have done usually. But her rage couldn't be just cause  of him... No, she was furious... and she was furious with herself.  That was the main part of her rage: she had hurt Michiru... <em>again</em>.  Though what had triggered her reaction had been his words... <em>'...my  Michi-chan...'</em>. That words had cut so deeply in her soul that she  had been breathless for a moment. That words had brought pain deep  inside, a pang she couldn't tolerate... and so her fist raised behind  her head and she readied a major blow channeling in it all her mixed  emotions.</p>
<p>For  the shortest moment everyone held their breath waiting for the blow  to collide with the dark-haired man's face. They were unconsciously  aware that would have been bad... really bad. But the punch never  came.</p>
<p>Her  hand remained there trembling slightly in the effort of restraining  all her force. Her eyes full of rage had moved from the dark-haired  man in front of her to the figure behind his back several meters  away... and she had seen ocean-blue eyes and the sorrow in them. It  would have felt good to vent some of her anger, but not at the cost  of hurting Michiru more, and sure beating up Seiya would have done  just that. Then after some moments she relaxed, lowered her clenched  fist and let go of the pop-singer's shirt, she did that never  breaking eye-contact with Michiru.</p>
<p>The  small audience gave a sigh of relief at the gesture, no one spoke but  they all relaxed visibly. It sure wasn't a nice show to watch two of  them resort to violence to solve a quarrel. It could be a sign their  community's precarious equilibrium was shattering under the weight of  the situation... after all it could have already happened cause they  were about to part in two groups... and unity could have been their  greater strength. But suddenly their momentary relaxation was shaken  by a dull noise.</p>
<p>THWACK!</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka-papa!&quot;  Hotaru yelled running to the blonde that now was bent in pain, her  hand on her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Seiya!&quot;  Taiki soon grabbed his brother by an arm and pulled him away from the  blonde.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka-papa!&quot;  The little girl was soon beside the blonde and turned to glare at  Seiya in a perfect imitation of an adult's menacing glare with her  little black brows furrowed and her purple eyes sparkling  dangerously.</p>
<p>Both  Seiya and Taiki were struck by that expression, then Taiki turned to  his brother whose fury had subsided when he had realized what he had  done.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...  you deserved that, Seiya-kun...&quot; He said referring to the kid's  look, &quot;Wow, I'm sure she'll be pretty scary when she'll be a  grown-up.&quot; He concluded with a pleased smirk. &quot;Anyway, I  won't ask you to apologize cause I know you're not going to, but  please make us - <em>all of us</em> - a favor and get gone before she  decides to return your 'courtesy'.&quot; Taiki prompted his brother.</p>
<p>Haruka  recomposed herself and when she straightened up Hotaru gasped seeing  the copious amount of blood trickling from her nose. The blonde  cleaned one hand on her pants and ruffled Hotaru's head in a  reassuring gesture.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  fine, Hime-chan. Look, it doesn't even hurt.&quot; She said smiling  down at the little girl.</p>
<p>The  others took their previously held breaths and Ami was the first  reacting quickly going to Haruka. As the blue-haired girl checked to  see if her nose was broken Haruka never broke eye-contact with the  figure in the distance who had a very sad look and was unmoving. Then  she looked down at Hotaru smiling again and then she turned glaring  to Seiya, her eyes swirling with rage, but she didn't move.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm...  let's just hope she doesn't beat him back...&quot; Mina considered.</p>
<p>&quot;Well  he sure would deserve that!&quot; Exclaimed Lita who was beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;She  won't do anything like that...&quot; A male voice said from behind  them. They turned to see Jade.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh  let's listen to the smart-ass... why are you so sure?&quot; Lita  snarled at him. But Jade didn't answer, he just looked in the  distance and smiled knowingly. The tall brunette looked at him  doubtful then turned again to the small group, Mina on the contrary  followed Jade's look and saw Michiru with a very sad look in her  eyes, then she looked back to the main group and saw Haruka looking  at Michiru too.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm...&quot;  She mumbled thinking about that fact.</p>
<p>&quot;What  it is it, Mina? You have <em>that</em> look...&quot; Usagi asked her  from her other side, a curious look in her light-blue eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;What  look?&quot; Inquired Lita now curious too.</p>
<p>&quot;The  look she always has when something concerning someone happens.&quot;  Usagi concluded, but Lita remained quite confused by her answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  please don't listen to her.&quot; Mina said to Lita, then she  continued, &quot;Anyway... she won't beat him back, believe me.&quot;  She said, a knowing smirk creeping out on her lips.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Are  you sure?&quot; The tanned woman asked, with an indulgent look. &quot;It's  never wise to leave things untold...&quot;
<p>&quot;Please!  Look what telling things had brought to me!&quot; She scoffed  pointing at her swollen and bruised nose.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  fuss or it will start bleeding again!&quot; Setsuna couldn't stifle a  laugh at Haruka's snort. She was rearranging more safely the  haemostatic plugs in her nostrils and at  the older woman remark she cast her a deadly glare.</p>
<p>&quot;If  you wouldn't have kept things from her in the first place-...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh  Setsuna-san, spare me!&quot; Haruka snapped, her head throbbing  again. She massaged her temples and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Are  you sure you haven't had a head concussion?&quot; Setsuna's half  joked, but glanced down at the blonde worried.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  not like that baka's punch was much of a  threat, it's just my stupid head that won't stop throbbing...&quot;  She murmured.</p>
<p>&quot;If  you say so...&quot; Setsuna conceded not too convinced.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka-papa,  we're ready to go!&quot; Hotaru said walking towards them with a tiny  rucksack on her shoulder more to not make her feel useless cause it  was nearly empty.</p>
<p>An  hour had passed since the fight and the 'cave-group' had prepared to  leave. Comments and suppositions had been made about Haruka's and  Michiru's quarrel and about Seiya's intrusion but all of them had  been wise enough not to mention it in the blonde's nearness. Hotaru  had spent most of that time with Michiru before the group's  departure, while Seiya had been kept wisely aside by Taiki - the  commotion and edgy situation had got the two brothers closer.</p>
<p>Now  they were ready to leave the beach and walk towards the new  adventure, a weird feeling had spread among them in the last hours,  they were strangers for one another and they had been together for  less than a week but they had started to get accustomed to each  other's company and that parting felt really uncomfortable. But then  was late for second thoughts, so rucksacks shouldered the larger  group of survivors was ready to go: Haruka led the way, behind her  were Hotaru and Setsuna, then Dr. Mizuno and Ami followed by Mina,  Serena and Darien, the last group consisted of Rei, Yuiichiro and  Rei's grandfather who brought up the rear of the small line.</p>
<p>Furuhata  watched the group entering the forest from afar, some doom-laden  feeling made his stomach clench. 'It's not like we're not going to  meet again. They'll be just a half an hour walk away...' But the  uneasiness inside him didn't vanish.</p>

<em>&quot;'Una-chan,  where are you going?&quot; He was shocked, when he had entered his  sister's room she was throwing her clothes disorderly inside a  haversack in a frenzy.</em>
<p><em>&quot;I  don't know yet.&quot; She answered curtly, her green eyes were  glistening with unshed tears.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;What's  happened, Una-chan? Why are you packing?&quot; He insisted panicking  slightly.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  can't stay here one more minute!&quot; She exclaimed vehemently.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You  argued with them again, didn't you?&quot; He had figured it out when  he had passed the living room where her mother and father were  quarreling, though they had hushed their tone when they had spotted  him at the entrance leaving his shoes and putting his slippers on, he  hadn't paid attention to it at first, cause it wasn't unusual in  their family, especially when Unazuki was involved. She had a lively  spirit and a strong inclination for getting in troubles. She was one  of those persons who can't stay away from those kind of things, sure  it was always for good reasons or out of generosity but the fact was  that she was always in some kind of mess. And that was something his  tranquil and plain parents couldn't understand. This was the mainly  reason they were always fighting, his sister couldn't stay still and  cold and his parents couldn't help but care and worry and trying to  protect her. He had always been the one balancing the two parts, he  had always interceded with his parents for her and had always tried  to keep her out of trouble whenever he could. He had tried to have  equilibrium for both of them, after all she was his sister... no, she  was more... she was his twin sister, they were two part of the same  person.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  won't argue anymore... I won't be a bother for them anymore,  Fu-chan.&quot; She said fastening up her bag. She shouldered it and  looked at him with her green eyes and soon he saw big tears run down  her smooth cheeks.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh  come on, Una-chan, what are you doing? You can't leave!&quot; He said  stopping her with a forced embrace. She didn't struggled, instead she  sunk into his arms and leaned against his chest, soon he heard  suffocated sobs coming from her and warm wetness through his shirt.</em></p>
<p><em>Furuhata  held her for a long time until her sobs subsided then he lifted her  chin with his hand and wiped her stained cheeks sweetly. They looked  at each other for a minute, since they had been kids they hadn't  needed too much words to understand what the other was feeling, it  was like they could read right into each other's heart.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;We'll  solve it out...&quot; He whispered her smiling softly. &quot;I'll  make it better, let me help.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh  Fu-chan... you're too good for me... but... I can't stay here, I feel  like I'm suffocating...&quot; She looked at him intensely, &quot;...you  see... they won't understand, they want me to be different from what  I am... and I can't.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>He  listened to her in silence, his hope to make her stay thinning by the  minutes. &quot;Hey, parents never understand offspring, you know  that.&quot; He tried to reason.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yeah...  and offspring never stays home forever...&quot; She said bitterly. At  her words he stifled, it seemed like nothing could make her change  her mind. He let go of her and looked again in her green eyes to  search for a little chance of keeping her there with them... with </em>him<em>. But he couldn't  find any, just resolve and sadness.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;They  want me to live my life emotionless... but I'm going to die this  way... I'm going to die inside. You understand Fu-chan, doesn't you?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>And  of course he understood, everything in Unazuki's  life was emotionally huge: every thing that happened to her, every  cause she decided to embrace, every person she decided to love... or  to hate. Every single moment she had to feel something and it always  had to be something strong. When she was happy she was jubilant...  and when she was sad... she was totally heart-broken, shattered.  Everything less than that it was like to be dead for her. So he  couldn't lie to her...</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  know... I know.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Then...  you have to help me.&quot; The new resolve on her face made him  shiver. Nonetheless he nodded and she continued. &quot;You have to  drive me to the airport... No no, please... let me finish. I won't  say goodbye to them we'll sneak out unseen and then you can say them  I run away.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>It  was a crazy plan, their parents would have known he was involved...  he was </em>always<em> involved... but Furuhata wasn't afraid of being blamed, it was  something he was used to and it was right cause he was responsible  for her... what scared him was to part from his sister, it was the  thought of knowing she was somewhere away from him, alone, maybe  scared and he wasn't there to help her.</em></p>
<p><em>As  reading his mind she touched his shoulder and smiled reassuringly at  him. &quot;Hey bro', you have to be brave, if you're not brave how  can I be?&quot; She said and this time it was her turn to wipe tears  from his cheeks.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;But...  Una-chan you know you've always been the brave one, not me...&quot;  She smiled at him, cupped his cheek and kissed it.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  love you, Fu-chan, I don't know what could I do without you.&quot;  Then she took her sack and motioned him to go downstairs while she  escaped from the window.</em></p>
<p><em>An  hour later they were at the airport, Unazuki had a ticket to Sidney –  Australia - in her hand and Furuhata felt like his life was about to  change forever.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Well...  it's time...&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Una-chan  promise me you'll write.&quot; He gasped, choking back tears.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Fu-chan...  You'll be always with me, you know that... and if you ever get lost  I'll find you and the same if </em>I<em> get lost... and you know </em>that<em> is more likely... me loosing my path and you bringing me back.&quot;  She smiled but she too had tears running down her face.</em></p>

The  world disappeared as soon as she put the violin under her chin and  the bow rubbed the strings. She had spent a couple of minutes tuning  the ancient instrument and then she had immersed herself in a new  world made of notes and pauses, crescendos and diminuendos, where  everything was clear, where every move and sound was something she  could feel clearly, every emotion was moldable by the movements of  her fingers, when she played she was the one deciding what kind of  emotion her audience would have felt. Most of the times she used to  transmit her own emotions, the feeling the music made her feel, but  when she wanted to she could make the music just like she wanted it  to be. That was what gave her confidence, she was the one in control  there - in the world of music - and there she could let herself feel  completely cause whenever she wanted to she could reverse the  situation.
<p>In  that right moment she wanted to forget everything but the music, she  wanted to forget the island, the dead people, she wanted to forget  the fear and the pain, truths and lies. Soon the soothing effect of  the music relaxed her tense nerves and the notes begun to come  smoothly from her skillful fingers.</p>
<p>And  so an hour passed until she felt her fingers numb for exertion and  her heart lighter. It had been so hard not being able to play for so  many days, she couldn't remember a single day without playing her  violin since she was five. She needed it like she needed to breathe.</p>
<p>When  Michiru finally stopped she felt regenerated and ready to face the  world with brand new energy. She lowered the violin and the bow and  looked around to check if Seiya was in the nearness. The young  pop-star had been a pain lately, he had asked – no, <em>ordered</em> – her to tell what had happened with Haruka. Of course Michiru  hadn't told him, it was something between her and the blonde and sure  it was none of Seiya's business. She also hadn't liked his attitude,  the commanding tone like it was his right to know and affect her life  the way he wanted. But most of all she was mad cause of the  intercourse between him and Haruka, and though Haruka had hurt her,  Michiru was really upset with Seiya too... he had hit Haruka and that  was something unforgivable. And the hard part was that Michiru  herself had been the cause of that... she couldn't help but feel  responsible. She didn't like to feel accountable for someone else's  behavior and she didn't like to feel guilty, that was the main reason  she had been so detached during the past years: she had a lot of  responsibilities towards her music, her career, her audience and her  family, she didn't want responsibilities towards people too. It was  already taxing to be 'perfect' for the world and her parents without  other persons having expectation of other kind.</p>
<p>'Besides <em>she</em> passed the test and <em>he</em> didn't...' her inner voice  said. She hated violence, it was something rude and absurd and never  made things better... no way. Michiru had seen Haruka restraining  herself from hitting Seiya earlier that morning, and she had really  appreciated it, that was the reason she had been shocked when she had  seen Seiya punching her with all his force. She was absolutely sure  it had been her look to keep Haruka back and now she felt like she  had punched the blonde herself.</p>
<p>She  realized she had started again to think about those things as soon as  she had stopped playing, that annoyed her and she forced herself to  concentrate on her instrument. The polished wooden surface was  shining but she decided to treat it like she always did before  replacing the violin in its case. It was then that she realized she  had no more wax nor chamois leather.</p>
<p>&quot;Shimatta!&quot;  She hissed, looking down at the empty small can.</p>
<p>&quot;My  my, swearing does not suit you, Michiru-chan!&quot; A male voice came  as a figure shadowed the morning sun. When she looked up at him Seiya  smiled brightly, but she didn't reciprocate. Instead she hurried to  close her violin's case and stood from her sitting position, ignoring  completely the black-haired man.</p>
<p>&quot;C'mon  Michi-chan, I was just kidding.&quot; He said in a exasperated tone,  &quot;What happened, did your violin get damaged? Of course! It takes  someone who knows musical instruments to take care of such a delicate  item and she sure isn't one.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  didn't comment, she didn't even look at him instead she walked away  at a quick pace. But Seiya sure wasn't one to give up easily, the  aqua-haired woman did know that and soon sighed resignedly when she  saw him at her side again. They walked in silence for a while, he had  at least the decency of keep quite, but Michiru knew he would have  had another go any minute and she felt she couldn't tolerate it.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen  to me Seiya-kun, you know me, right?&quot; He nodded, with a sparkle  of hope in his dark eyes, &quot;And you know how it is when I'm  upset... Well, now I'm very <em>very</em> upset. So I don't want you to  talk about me or my violin and I can't tolerate you hinting at <em>other  people</em>,&quot; she stressed the last words and cast him a glare as  to say 'we both know who and why',&quot;right now I would really  appreciate if you would leave me alone.&quot; His face fell  miserably, he had tried to lighten up the mood but he knew before  starting that Michiru wasn't the kind of person to fall for it.</p>
<p>Seiya  nodded disconsolate, his shoulder slumped, his look downcast, he had  the perfect hangdog look, but Michiru wasn't moved by that, and  walking away she clarify something.</p>
<p>&quot;And  don't make a fool out of yourself: if it wasn't for her I wouldn't be  able to play my violin at all.&quot; Said that she walked away,  searching for Lita.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  young chef was examining the rudimentary fishing net she had made out  of several luggage rack. Her look was quite skeptical, but Molly who  was sat beside her was clapping her hands enthusiastically. Shrugging  Lita put down the white net and stood to take a banana, she left  Molly engrossed in a conversation about her grandfather and their  cottage at the lake and how they used to go fishing with the very  attentive Umino.
<p>&quot;Hi  Lita-san,&quot; Michiru greeted her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  Michiru, hey!&quot; The tall brunette greeted back with a big smile.  &quot;I heard you playing, it was wonderful, you're very good!&quot;  She exclaimed bluntly. Michiru sweatdropped but thanked her for the  compliment.</p>
<p>&quot;Lita-san,  I wanted to ask you something...&quot; The aqua-haired woman began,  her interlocutor noticed the serious tone and soon turned to face her  and give her all her attention. &quot;...You said once that Jade has  every kind of item at his place, is that true?&quot; The brunette  nodded, a confused look in her eyes, then realization dawned in her  mind and she protested heatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;He's  dangerous Michiru! You shouldn't have anything to do with him, he's  trouble!&quot; Lita's firmness didn't move Michiru's resolve. The  aqua-haired woman thanked the brunette and turned walking away  quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru!&quot;  Lita called her, the violinist turned questioningly, &quot;He'll want  something from you!&quot;</p>
<p>'Doesn't  everyone?' Michiru thought to herself turning again and walking  towards Jade's spot.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Her  eyes dimmed and it was harder and harder to proceed on the awkward  path, more than once a jutting root made her stumbling. She felt her  headache getting worse every minute and she had to rest for a moment  leaning against a tree. Though Haruka tried to dismiss every  concerned gesture by Setsuna and even little Hotaru she knew  something was wrong.
<p>'I  think these days are getting onto me...' She felt exhausted and she  looked forward to when they would arrive and she will be able to  rest.</p>
<p>During  the eventless journey the tension decreased and at the end some  relaxed conversations spread throughout the group. Mina, Serena, Rei  and Ami soon seemed to get along very well and for them the journey  turned almost in a joyous trip. Rei's grandfather, Yuiichiro and  Darien were talking about more manly subjects... even too manly were  thinking two embarrassed Yuiichiro and Darien when the old man kept  making comments about female prettiness. At the front of the group  Setsuna and Kimiko Mizuno were kept in a more serious conversation  about their situation and what had happened since the crash-down.  Haruka led with Hotaru's tiny hand tightly gripped in her burning  hot, large one.</p>
<p>Finally  they reached the cave, soon everyone looked around in awe for the  beautiful spot with the little waterfall and the clear pool, Grandpa  wanted to explore the nearness of the forest to check for everything  useful. Mina and Serena immediately engaged in a quarrel about who  should have a certain spot.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  too large for just you, Mina! It would fit perfectly for me and my  Darien, though!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh  just cause I have no boyfriend... <em>here</em>,&quot; she stressed the  last word looking around to see if everyone was listening, &quot;I  have to settle in a cramped space! No way!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;C'mon  girls, there's plenty of space for everyone.&quot; Said the  embarrassed Darien trying to pacify the little 'territorial war'.</p>
<p>Way  more quiet was Rei's and Yuiichiro's choice even if Rei scolded the  young man a couple of times. Ami and her mother instead were given  the more comfortable and larger space cause they would have to  accommodate the patients.</p>
<p>Setsuna,  Haruka and Hotaru settled down quietly, the morning sun illuminating  the widest part of the den and only deeper it was still dark, the  spacious clearing on the front of the cave let the sun reach them but  not vertically. They laid their pallets and their scanty belongings  and then went to the doctor to help with the 'hospital' arrangements.</p>
<p>Haruka  and Yuiichiro were making a steady stretcher with some coats, ropes  and sturdy wooden sticks when Rei's grandfather returned from his  little exploration and offered Haruka to accompany him placing a  couple of traps.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank  you Grandpa-san... but I think I'll stay... I have to help the doctor  here.&quot; She refused the invitation. Soon Setsuna and the doctor  shot her a surprised look and exchanged a worried one. Actually right  then Haruka didn't have the strength to even stand and hoped the  excuse of helping the doctor wasn't too suspicious.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Mmh...?  I can't remember having sent invitations... but you honey... you're <em>always</em> welcome.&quot; Jade said without lifting his look from  the page he was reading. &quot;What does bring you here, baby? Maybe  is my undeniable charm... though you seem pretty busy charming people  yourself, out there...&quot; He winked at her.
<p>Michiru  didn't answer and remained impassible though inside he gave her the  shivers both for being creeping and knowing. She stood there at the  entrance of his tent for a minute in silence, he continued to read  regardless.</p>
<p>&quot;I  need something...&quot; She said not knowing what else to say.</p>
<p>He  smirked behind the book and then lowered it and looked her in the  eyes, amusement in his cold eyes. &quot;Well... you're in the right  place, then.&quot;</p>
<p>His  demeanor was more and more disturbing, but Michiru long ago had  learned to maintain a cold appearance whenever she was threatened or  scared and now she felt both ways. &quot;I need a piece of chamois  leather...&quot; In that right moment Michiru was thinking if it had  been such a good idea to come to him, after all it was only a  violin... but just thinking about the salty air and the moisten and  the sand in the breeze grazing its polished and ancient surface sent  a quiver down her spine. That instrument had been with her since she  was a child. It was a very precious item, it was almost  three-hundreds-year-old, an Italian master lutist made it in Cremona  and it had a very high value... but most of all for Michiru herself  it was priceless. It was a heirloom, and when she had wanted to play  an instrument her parents wanted to buy her another one cause that  was too precious to let it be touched by a child, but she had  promised to be careful and she had always considered that promise  valid even though more than twenty years had passed.</p>
<p>'If  I won't be able to take care properly of it I won't use it...' But  that mere thought was painful, now that she had it back she couldn't  lose the chance of playing it.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmh...  and what makes you think I have a piece of chamois leather, sugar?&quot;  His use of those rude nicknames was getting to her nerves and she  stiffened. He noticed it, figured out why and obviously didn't miss  the opportunity of letting her notice he knew. &quot;Oh yeah...  you're a lady... but I'm sure you like it rough every now and then,  don't ya?&quot; He expected to see a disgusted or shocked look on her  face but it never happened and he smirked admitting inside she was  tougher than he had thought... yeah... he liked her more and more.</p>
<p>&quot;So?  Do you have it? Or am I wasting my time with you?&quot; She said  straightforwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmh...  the lady is all business and no fun... too bad. Well, I happen to  have a piece of chamois leather, but the real question is: what have <em>you</em> to give me in exchange?&quot; His iron gray eyes piercing  through her, his handsome manly features seemed made out of pure cold  stone.</p>
<p>&quot;What  do you want?&quot; She asked back, not wanting to expose herself more  than she's been already doing.</p>
<p>He  laughed briefly, &quot;Well... there's something I'd want but I'm  sure it's beyond dispute.&quot; He looked at her greedily and  lustfully and smiled a knowing smile to which she didn't react though  inside she was petrified. &quot;But maybe... something way less  compromising...&quot; He straightened up in his seat, &quot;...the  price you have to pay in every fairy tale.&quot; His eyes sparkled  when he saw recognition in her look. He stood and rummaged in one of  his suitcases and took out a neatly folded piece of chamois leather,  then he walked to her, a cruel smile on his lips. &quot;So? Are you  going to give me a little kiss for this neat and soft piece of  leather?&quot; His voice suddenly sugary and insinuating.</p>
<p>Michiru's  first thought was that it was disgusting, he was a handsome man but  the entire situation was disgusting and <em>he</em> was just horrible,  besides the meaning of that was humiliating. On the other hand she  wanted that piece of leather and...</p>
<p>'Think  about what Seiya would do if he knew... think what <em>she</em> would  do...' Her inner voice was trying to make her see some sense, but the  result was just the contrary. Michiru suddenly thought that gesture  would have hurt back badly the two persons that had recently hurt her  instead.</p>
<p>'Well,  Seiya without a doubt cause I know how he feels about me... but  Haruka... she sure isn't... No! I'm being presuming... though she  sure seems... and Mina talked like she knew Haruka is... <em>gay</em>.  But even if she's gay that doesn't mean she'd be... attracted to  me...' The aqua-haired beauty was lost in her inner monologue and was  brought back to reality by Jade's voice.</p>
<p>&quot;So?&quot;  Michiru looked at him and then knew... The first word coming to her  mind at the sight of him was 'dangerous'... he was that, he was <em>dangerous</em>. And even if Haruka <em>surely</em> wasn't attracted  to her, Michiru had noticed how protective and thoughtful the blonde  was... 'Yes, she sure wouldn't like such thing.' The compulsive  desire of hurting those two made her decide, more than the need of  the piece of leather.</p>
<p>So  the violinist stepped closer to the taller long-haired man, cupped  his nape and brought her lips to his. As the dry male-lips touched  hers and his rough, not shaved face scratched her cheek she wasn't  thinking of how hurt Seiya and Haruka would have been... right then  she could just remember how soft and smooth an other cheek had been  when she had kissed it only yesterday, how good had felt that soaked,  shivering body against hers and how that fast heart-beat had  resembled music.</p>
<p>When  he had made his bid, Jade hadn't thought she would have accepted, he  had just intended to be provoking so it took him by surprise when she  came closer and without saying anything she kissed him, but soon the  kiss ended and he was looking right in icy ocean-blue eyes. The  long-haired man lent her the piece of leather and when she had taken  it he looked her straight in the eyes and smirked.</p>
<p>&quot;Next  time, for the wood-polish, I hope you'll put more spirit in it... or  at least more tongue!&quot; He laughed rudely and Michiru had to  stifle a sob as she walked away with the chamois leather grasped  tightly in her hand.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Sure  it would have seemed a crazy thought but Furuhata was thinking it  felt good to work there, with the mild warm breeze grazing his hair,  the comforting incessant sound of the waves on the shore and the  tuned whistling of Yaten beside him. The young singer was arranging  an improbable fishing item just to look busy with something useful  when in reality he was composing some melody. Furuhata thought it  felt like when he was home fixing some electrical or electronic  appliance in the back-room of the arcade... he used to have always  the radio on and listen to some music. It reminded him when Unazuki  still lived with them, there used to be always music coming from her  room, even at night, as a teenager she had her pop idols to cheer for  and he had even had to escort her to some concerts so that their  parents weren't too worried to let her go alone.
<p>He  chuckled remembering that time when she had been escorted away by the  Security when she had tried to reach the dressing rooms to get an  autograph and then she had waited – with him tagged along, of  course – until the singer had left the concert and had her  autograph in spite of the Security... and then she had given the  hard-won autograph to her best-friend cause she had been ill and  couldn't make it to the concert.</p>
<p>'That's  my Una-chan...'</p>
<p>The  chuckling had got Yaten's attention who was looking at the blond man  questioningly. When Furuhata realized his thoughts were manifest on  his face he blushed and returned to his work, after all he was  quite  in a hurry cause he wanted the antennas to be placed before the late  afternoon rain.</p>
<p>He  wanted to amplify the signal to be able not only to receive other's  transmission but also to send an S.O.S. He hadn't been discouraged by  his previous failures, that was his main good quality: perseverance.  In that he and his twin sister were the same, they weren't two to  give in when they believed in something deeply. Perseverance was what  had made him keep going around the world whenever Unazuki had been in  need for help; perseverance was what had made her achieve her targets  even when everything and everyone kept telling her it was a hopeless  case. But perseverance was what the last Unazuki's letter lacked...  in that letter she seemed to have surrendered... and he knew that  meant she was in one of her 'depressed' phases... a bad one. 'Please  wait for me Una-chan...' He plead in his head.</p>
<p>Despite  those thoughts his hands never stopped and soon three identical items  laid on his makeshift table. Beside each of them laid a thin  firecracker he had found in the plane wrack. Now he needed only two  trustworthy persons. He never looked at the silver-haired guy sat a  couple of steps from him, he was still engrossed in his whistling,  and the blond knew he wasn't too keen to go into the forest, instead  Furuhata walked resolutely where the pregnant girl and the  bespectacled young man sat talking.</p>
<p>Attendance  obtained Furuhata made his way to his next destination. It was a  short walk and soon he could hear the sad notes, the melody was one  of deep sorrow and heavy mood. The strain went on with slow dark  tones and the young technician couldn't help but stop at a distance  and listen to the violin sonata. He couldn't even breathe fearing  about breaking that seemingly mystical concentration. He liked music  but that was the first time it was able to move his heart in such a  powerful way. Then he thought it was the musician more than the music  itself to affect him. The <em>honesty</em> she put in those notes was  the amazing thing, it sounded like she really felt what she was  playing, that she really felt sad - and angry, when the rhythm  increased - that she was truly full of such feelings that she had to  let them out. Hers looked like a cathartic playing by which she could  lighten her soul from all the painful feelings. Actually Furuhata  didn't know exactly what was on Michiru's heart, but he knew what was  in his own.</p>
<p>Right  then the void he felt when he thought about his sister seemed to  enlarge and it felt like he was physically deprived. It burnt like  hell inside, like a piece of his body had been torn apart from him  brutally. And maybe it had been really that way.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;I  can't believe you made me do something illegal!&quot; He said that  with an incredulous smile on his lips. The hot day was giving way to  the refreshing night and the sight of the sunset was amazing. The  setting sun tinged the sky and the calm sea of crimson and the  silhouettes of the palms stood out black against the horizon. It was  true what they used to say, the sunset seen from the Hawaii was  something enchanting.</em>
<p><em>&quot;C'mon  bro'... admit it! Admit you had fun!&quot; She laughed looking at him  with sparkling eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;No  way! We were almost arrested! Wait a minute, Una-chan, you actually </em>has been<em> arrested!&quot;  He exclaimed but the amusement didn't disappeared from his voice.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh...  but you took me out... as always.&quot; She grinned.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Well...  cause I promised the police you wouldn't do that again!&quot; He had  also paid for the damage of the wall she and her 'friends' had soiled  with their slogans. And then there had been the breaking and entering  of that company-building against which they were protesting, the one  who was polluting the bay. That was her new cause to defend even with  not so legal means. But nonetheless when she had called him from  prison he had taken the first flight and had taken her out of jail.  And then he had even helped them.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh  well... </em>you<em> promised  them cause... you know... I can't swear I won't do it again next  time...&quot; She said that with a smile but he knew she was saying  it seriously.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Ok,  but next time don't even think about calling me, Una-chan! Cause I  have no intention of end up in jail for you!&quot; He too smiled and  he too was very serious, but this time she didn't believe him cause  no matter how big trouble she was in... he was always coming to her  rescue.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;It  seems like we can't be apart for more than some months.&quot; She  laughed at her thought but how true it was!</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yeah...&quot;  He agreed pensively. They remained in silence for a while, the light  was fading and in a dozen of minutes it would have been dark. In the  dim light she looked at him, his skin was paler than hers cause she  was tanned by the islands sun. Her eyes lingered on the paler mark on  his left upper arm. She had one identical on her right upper arm.</em></p>
<p><em>When  he realized she was staring at him he got her attention. &quot;What?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Do  you remember what those scars are?&quot; She gestured to his arm and  then hers, he smiled then turned to her and answered.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Of  course, we got'em falling down by a carousel when we were very little  kids...&quot; Unazuki shook her head resignedly and smiled.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;That's  what mom and dad told you... but the truth is...&quot; She looked at  him intently, he stared her out. He knew exactly what she was about  to say, they had had that conversation about a thousand times and it  had a very special meaning for the two of them. &quot;That is where  they cut us apart cause it's clear we were born joined together.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>As  always she smiled broadly and as always he laughed out loud and gave  her his reasonable answer.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh  Una-chan, we were </em>not<em> Siamese twins!&quot; That was an old joke but whenever they talked  about that it was like reasserting their bond was something  transcending mere blood ties.</em></p>

For  the fifth time Rei leaned down to scoop away a small sharp stone from  the spot they'd use for the night and for the fifth time he was there  leaned down beside her. She turned to him and her irritated glare met  with his kind smile on his unshaved face. His quite long hair dropped  on his eyes and that expression always gentle and expecting... it was  unnerving and she – despite the fact she was a miko – wasn't one  with too much patience and it was always difficult to restrain her  temper away from her grandfather's shrine. She stood, took a deep  breathe and looked at him straight in the eyes, her dark eyes glaring  mercilessly.
<p>&quot;Look  Yuiichi-chan I really don't need you to stick up onto me this way!&quot;  She hadn't even tried to keep her tone low. Yuiichiro looked down and  remained silent as usual, ready to get his lecture, seeing that  familiar attitude got to Rei who sighed exasperated. Right then her  grandfather was entering the cave.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey  Grandpa's back, go to him...&quot; Yuiichiro looked up almost  surprised, &quot;...and please don't bother coming back to me for at  least a couple of hours.&quot; And with that she turned and was back  to her job. Yuiichiro did just like he was told and walked towards  the entry of the cave where the old man was talking with Darien, the  doctor and Setsuna.</p>
<p>As  he was passing by them Mina and Serena couldn't kept from looking at  him frowning, but he seemed not to realize or just not to care.</p>
<p>&quot;What's  up with the 'bitchiness'?&quot; Mina looked  at Rei. &quot;I can't even get if he's her boyfriend or what else...  she's always so rude to him...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...  and he is always so kind and sweet. I couldn't treat my Darien like  that, I love him too much!&quot; Serena exclaimed a little too loud.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...  and that also cause he'd break up with you in a minute...&quot; At  that Serena's eyes watered and Mina rolled her eyes exasperated. Not  wanting to look to her cry-baby best-friend, Mina turned towards the  bigger group not giving her the chance of bursting out in tears.</p>
<p>Beside  the five who were standing and talking were Ami and Hotaru who were  reading out of the same book and Ami seemed to explain things to the  little girl. In front of them Haruka was looking into space with an  absent look in her dark-rimmed teal eyes. Mina didn't realized she  was staring until Serena peeped up from behind her to look what her  friend was staring at.</p>
<p>&quot;Aha!  You're looking at her again... have you a crush on her, Mina?!?!&quot;  The pigtailed girl asked with a ridiculous knowing expression on her  face.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  be silly Serena...&quot; But Mina didn't  shifted her look from the oblivious car-racer. Serena follow it and  stopped briefly to look at her too.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...  when I thought she was a boy... well... I have to admit she's quite  handsome...&quot; Mina nodded but didn't answered. &quot;Though she  looks... sad, doesn't she?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do  you think it's about what's happened this morning?&quot; Serena was  sincerely concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmmh...  definitely.&quot; Mina answered firmly, she was always interested in  others' love-lives and often she had played Cupid, maybe cause hers  wasn't too lucky, maybe cause she always acted nonchalant but  intimately she was a romantic that hadn't been able to forget her  first love who had fallen in love with her old best-friend back when  she had spent a couple of years in England as a teenager.</p>
<p>This  time she was sure to be the only one thinking about Haruka's and  Michiru's affair as a love one, she suspected even the two persons  involved weren't too aware of that. Mina, not being prejudiced, could  see Haruka's behavior and even if maybe it was just a game of her own  mind Mina couldn't think the racer's attachment to the aqua-haired  musician being something due just to the critical situation.</p>
<p>'Maybe  you want to see romance everywhere, Mina.' She thought to herself.</p>
<p>And  Michiru too was deeply sensitive when it came to Haruka, though  always kind and polite the young violinist seemed also detached but  when the little child or the car-racer were involved she seemed to  put an unusual spirit in it. And then there had been that morning's  events. In Mina's mind Michiru's sad and hurt look was vivid, like  vivid was the memory of Haruka's and Michiru's exchange of looks that  had led to Seiya's blow.</p>
<p>&quot;Mina?  Mina! Do you think...? I mean we saw them embracing yesterday, but  Michiru... well she doesn't look... I mean...&quot; Serena seemed  embarrassed, but curious about her best-friend's opinion.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh  Serena... she doesn't look what?!? <em>Gay</em>!?! You don't have to <em>look</em> gay to <em>be</em> gay... besides you'll be surprised about  how many persons who 'doesn't look gay' are indeed gay.&quot; Mina  wasn't irritated by her friend's thickness, she knew Serena since  kinder-garden and she knew Serena was naive but not obtuse nor  prejudiced.</p>
<p>The  pigtailed girl stared at Haruka for a minute then she turned to Mina  with a bright smile, her patented 'Serena's optimistic smile'. &quot;Well,  after all it's just about love, doesn't it Mina? I think they should  at least talk with each other... I feel so bad every time I fight  with Darien... I can't stand it!&quot;</p>
<p>Mina  smiled to her friend. That was Serena, the girl always quick to think  the best about people and situations, in the end Serena was capable  of seeing good in everything and everyone and that was one of the  biggest qualities her beloved ones loved most about her. And sure  Mina wasn't an exception. &quot;You're right, Serena, but I don't  think it's as easy as it is for you and Darien... There can be  things... and <em>people</em> in the way...&quot; Mina contemplated the  possibility to talk to Haruka, but she soon put aside that thought  considering probably Michiru was the more reasonable of the two. Sure  Mina didn't think that was none of her business... when it came to  such things she had always felt like it was her duty to arrange  things for people in love... some kind of mission. She had done that  for most of her friends, even for Serena and Darien.</p>
<p>&quot;You know what, Mina? It's a big  deal... for Michiru, I mean...&quot; The seriousness in Serena's  voice got Mina's attention and she looked at her best-friend who was  frowning expecting an unlikely brilliant suggestion, &quot;...I mean  Seiya and Haruka... they are both very handsome and charming, it's  hard to decide!&quot; Serena exclaimed and after a moment she and  Mina burst out in laughter getting everyone's attention but Haruka's  who had her eyes closed and her head reclined on her knees.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Thank  you Michiru-san.&quot; Furuhata thanked her for the fifth time in a  couple of minutes. Just a few hours ago he would have asked Haruka,  he had learned to trust the blonde racer even though they often had  completely different opinions – and maybe that had been a reason  for trusting her, cause she should have told him if his plans would  have been too crazy or completely hopeless, but then that right  morning their little community had split up and Haruka was no longer  there. Sure he could have asked Lita or one of the Kou brothers but  the young cook seemed more interested in keeping an eye on that  Jade-guy and with the skills with big knives she had previously shown  them he sure felt safer with her watching him. There were Taiki or  Seiya but somehow Furuhata had been drawn to the violinist, he  suspected she was way less helpless than her ladylike appearance and  manners suggested and he was sure she would have been more careful  and sensible than Seiya. That had been why he had asked Michiru to  place one of the antennas and she had accepted almost immediately.  Now they were waiting for Umino to come and getting ready.
<p>&quot;Stop  thanking me Furuhata-kun, I'm doing it for my own sake too.&quot; She  assured him kindly, they were leaned against the same big trunk  watching the waves rustling against the shore.</p>
<p>&quot;They  have to find us. They have to.&quot; He murmured oblivious of voicing  out his inner thoughts, Michiru didn't comment letting him unburden  himself from his fears. &quot;I can't stay here...&quot; The blond's  voice became clearer and the musician figured he was now talking with  her, maybe looking for some kind of comfort, &quot;Someone has to  find us cause right now she's lost and I have to go and find her. I  promised and she needs me.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  surprised looked at him, he had never talked about someone waiting  for him at home. On the other hand they had had just a couple of  conversations and mostly about practical matters. &quot;Someone will  come, Furuhata-kun... and it'll be thanks to you.&quot; Michiru said  and was soon in front of him with her kindest smile on her graceful  face. The blond man was captured by that gentle gesture and smiled  back. Michiru then noticed his green eyes were moistening and then  she found herself doing something she had rarely done in her life.  She pulled him in a sisterly embrace and made him cry on her  shoulder. After the first moment of surprise he let himself go and  soon quiet sobs shook his larger frame.</p>
<p>Michiru  was a caring person, but her life had been poor in relations, her  childhood and adolescence had been taken by violin and painting  lessons and obviously school, her early youth had passed between  rehearsal for her concerts and recordings, then art exhibitions and  college, and so friendships had been sacrificed for the sake of her  career, of course a couple of boyfriends had been approved by her  parents but she had had so little interest in them she could barely  remember their names although she had shared with them years and even  intimate moments. So it felt strange to comfort someone she barely  knew.</p>
<p>Furuhata  felt all his tension melt and he cried in the embrace of a beautiful  almost stranger, but just then he sure wasn't thinking about all the  envious men around the world if they could see that scene.</p>
<p>But  it was just a couple-of-minutes-thing, soon he recomposed himself. He  straightened and fumbled in his back pocket taking out his wallet for  Michiru's surprise. Then he slipped out a creased picture and lent it  to her with trembling hands. Michiru took it and looked at it  curious.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't  she beautiful?&quot;</p>
<p>The  aqua-haired woman at first thought about a girlfriend but soon she  noticed the incredible resemblance between the smiling green-eyed  girl in the picture and the young man in front of her. The same warm  smile, delicate features and freckled nose, just their hair color was  different, she had mahogany shoulder-length hair up in a ponytail  instead of his golden blond. It was a picture of both of them, they  were smiling like she had never seen Furuhata smile before.</p>
<p>'Well,  it's obvious, what the Hell would he smile for here?' She thought,  annoyed with herself for such a 'normal' thought. But she had the  feeling he hadn't smiled that way for way more than four days. In  that picture he looked like he was confident and... fulfilled. In  their current situation he seemed just... <em>lost</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Is  she your sister?&quot; The aqua-haired girl inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Hai.  My onee-chan, Unazuki.&quot; He had a dreamy expression and Michiru  couldn't help but chuckle briefly. Incredibly enough he soon blushed  and mimicked her with a quite but sincere laugh. &quot;Ok, I know,  I've got it bad. I'm one of those brothers... the kind who thinks his  sister is the most beautiful and brilliant and generous woman in the  world.&quot; He smiled at Michiru broadly and she thought that was a  smile very similar to the one in the picture.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  worry, everyone has their family complex, besides she actually <em>is</em> beautiful and she has a bright smile too.&quot; She concluded kindly  and at that very moment a panting Umino was approaching them,  obviously in a hurry.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry,  sorry I'm late!&quot; He managed to say between heavy breaths.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok,  now...&quot; Furuhata was immediately in business-mode and begun  giving instructions about their tasks. &quot;Don't go too far deep in  the forest we don't need that but be sure not to be on the beach we  don't want wind, salt and sun to ruin them.&quot; He pointed to the  two items on the makeshift desk. &quot;Walk for at least half an hour  with a good pace, maybe forty-five minutes it's better. When you  think the place is clear enough but with a little shelter you have to  secure the antenna to something and then you have to shot the rockets  so I can turn on the transmitter with an enhanced signal without  wasting the battery with hopeless attempts. Now, Umino-kun you will  be the first, Michiru-san you will shot when you see his signal.  Obviously Umino-kun you have to wait until you think Michiru-san has  done. Is it clear?&quot; He asked serious. The two nodded and soon  they were on their way, Umino eastward and Michiru westward.</p>
<p>They  were a dozen of meters away when Furuhata was seized by a sudden  worry. &quot;Please be careful! Don't take any unnecessary risk, if  you see or hear something suspicious run back!&quot; He yelled. A  vicious guilty feeling sneaking around his heart thinking how much he  had been wrapped up in his own issues lately and the sense of how  dangerous their task was struck him with force but it was already  late they were far and most of all he had already brought up their  hopes...</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Your  headache's still bothering you?&quot; Setsuna asked to the blonde  car-racer. She had observed Haruka from a distance for a while and it  was obvious something was wrong. She kept massaging her temples and  covering her eyes and she hadn't stood for more than an hour already,  her nose was still swollen but Setsuna was pretty sure that wasn't  the only reason for Haruka's state.
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;  Haruka lifted her head with a groan of protest.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  you do look like shit. I'm gonna call Mizuno-san, maybe she...&quot;  The older woman said but was interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;No!  No need to bother her, I'm fine. In fact I'm going to stretch my legs  a little.&quot; She replied hoping to dismiss the discussion and be  out of that situation soon, but when she gathered her little energy  to stand up the cave begun spinning, she was hit by a pang of nausea  and her knees shook violently.</p>
<p>Setsuna  saw the taller girl stumbling and promptly caught her firmly by an  arm with surprising strength.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't think fainting can go under the definition of 'fine'.&quot; The  sarcastic remark couldn't hide Setsuna's worries.</p>
<p>&quot;I  didn't fain-...&quot; Haruka wanted to reply but suddenly all went  black.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka!&quot;  Setsuna cried out trying to catch the blonde before she could hit the  ground and hurt herself. Her cry had got the others' attention and  suddenly Haruka's weight was lifted from her hands. Darien and  Yuiichiro laid the car-racer on the ground as the doctor instructed.</p>
<p>&quot;She's  burning hot.&quot; Setsuna said and doctor Mizuno nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  very high fever. Ami, we should have some paracetamol.&quot;  Without even a reply of assent the blue-haired girl was off rummaging  in the medications bag.</p>
<p>The  group was all gathered around the laying blonde. No one dared to  pronounce the question they all had in mind. They just stood there  with concern but also dread in their eyes. Doctor Mizuno obviously  knew what they were thinking, she had considered the idea herself  just for a minute, after all it was part of her job to think those  kind of things... and it was her job to give answers.</p>
<p>&quot;Setsuna-san,  you've been with her a lot, haven't you?&quot; After the tanned woman  nodded the doctor continued, &quot;Ok, let's have a little talk.&quot;  She said and motioned the other to follow her to where Ami was  collecting medications. The others remained in silence for a while  staring at the seemingly sleeping Haruka.</p>
<p>The  first to move was Rei, the miko kneeled down beside the feverish  racer and closed her eyes seeking concentration. Mina too snapped out  of her dazed state and made up her mind quickly, with resolve on her  face she walked to the cave entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;Mina  where are you going?&quot; Serena asked unreasonably worried about  her friend.</p>
<p>&quot;I  can't stay here doing nothing!&quot; Mina explained, &quot;I'll go  get Michiru.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are  you sure it's a good idea?&quot; Unusually wisely Serena tried to  made her friend think it up.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,  I'm more than sure.&quot; She replied winking at Serena trying to  reassure her, and it was true, she was damn sure Michiru <em>needed</em> to know even though maybe she <em>didn't want</em> to.</p>
<p>The  only comment by Serena was a light smile then Mina was out in the  forest with a quick pace. The pigtailed girl turned and saw the  blonde feverish racer shaking violently so she too made up her mind,  went to her pallet and pick a blanket up, but when she was about to  cover the trembling woman a soft hand stopped her. The blonde looked  up in surprise and confusion seeing Ami shaking her head no and  smiling somewhat sympathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;But...  she's cold!&quot; Was the weak protest, &quot;She's shaking...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  know... but she has to hold up, we have to reduce her fever.&quot;  The kind tone convinced Serena but she couldn't help but speak her  mind up as she folded the blanket in her lap.</p>
<p>&quot;It  looks cruel...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai...&quot;  Was the murmured – and for the American girl, incomprehensible –  Ami's comment.</p>
<p>Still  in a secluded spot the other Mizuno was questioning Setsuna who was  unknowingly confirming the doctor's suspects. As the tanned woman  talked to the pondering physician she had the uncomfortable feeling  of being observed.</p>
<p>Sadly  even kind-hearted and thoughtful adults sometimes forget about those  who can use their help, but she had been raised properly and she had  been taught not to interrupt adults that were talking, especially  about serious matters, so she stood there still and silent like a  good girl. And that was what Setsuna saw when she couldn't resist and  had to brush off the annoying sensation of being observed: Hotaru  standing unmoving with big watering eyes full of fear and a slightly  trembling lower lip.</p>
<p>&quot;Hime-chan,  come here!&quot; The always composed woman kneeled down offering her  arms for a motherly hug and soon she had a sobbing little bundle in  her lap. &quot;Don't cry honey...&quot; It was the only thing she  could manage to say caressing the black-haired head.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  I think it's time to make things clear...&quot; Doctor Mizuno said  kindly, she had an extremely brief briefing with her daughter for  about a minute then she cleared her throat and got the attention of  the whole group.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  pretty sure it's nothing infective.&quot; At that first sentence a  general held up breathe was taken and fear left room for concern and  a slight guilty feeling for being so selfish. &quot;We think it was  some kind of physical breakdown due of circumstances and exhaustion  and... well... behavior,&quot; she added with a meaningful look to  Setsuna, &quot;Maybe if she had spoke up earlier things wouldn't have  gone this far... Anyways...&quot; She kneeled beside Haruka and took  the pills her daughter had prepared and with some water made the  unconscious racer swallow them up. &quot;The fever is very high,  we'll try to reduce it, let's hope it'll work...&quot; The use of  terms like 'try' and 'hope' wasn't comforting especially when  pronounced by a doctor and Kimiko Mizuno knew that. &quot;Well she  sure isn't the most collaborative of patients but at least she's  unconscious!&quot; She joked eliciting a shocked look by her daughter  and a light knowing smile by Setsuna.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
At  the beach time passed lazily for everyone with the exception of  Furuhata who was nervously peering at the horizon eastward. Actually  it was foolish cause it was impossible that Umino had already reached  a qualified place: they had left not more than twenty-five minutes  ago. And Furuhata knew Umino had to wait for Michiru to find a  suitable place too, but he couldn't help it and was anxious and  jumpy.
<p>And  in fact he jumped when an uncomfortably cheerful Seiya approached him  from behind and patted his shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa!  You <em>do</em> can use a little relax, Furuhata-kun!&quot; The  pop-singer exclaimed with an amused smile. At first the blond looked  at the other man confused about his cheerfulness, then when the  annoying feeling it had something about the infamous happenings of  that very morning crept in his mind Furuhata dismissed the thought  not wanting to bother himself more than he already had cause of his  own turmoil.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  it's you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  the one and only.&quot; He said smiling broadly, he couldn't help but  being cheerful, although Michiru seemed pretty upset he was confident  that with the annoying car-racer out of the picture – at least  physically away – he would have been able to win the violinist's  attention and then even her heart. Why he subconsciously thought that  woman could be some sort of opponent in his gaining Michiru's heart  was something he did not want to think about.</p>
<p>After  a moment Seiya started a light conversation and soon the two young  men were chatting amiably. That was interrupted only ten minutes  later when a panting and obviously distressed Mina run to them  looking for Michiru.</p>
<p>That  declaration and the consequent reply by Furuhata got all Seiya's  attention so he inquired the blonde girl directly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why  are you looking for her?&quot; He was suspicious about all that  hurry.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  Haruka, she's sick. She fainted and now is unconscious.&quot; She  explained for Furuhata's horror and Seiya's perplexity. When Mina saw  the pop-singer's expression she added the little she knew about the  situation, &quot;The doc said she has a very high fever.&quot; Then,  addressing to Furuhata she added &quot;I thought Michiru wanted to  know it.&quot;</p>
<p>The  blond nodded, &quot;Yeah I think it too. Well she left half an hour  ago, with a good pace she can be reached in less than that.&quot; He  concluded reasonably.</p>
<p>&quot;What  direction?&quot; The girl soon asked, but as the technician was about  to answer Seiya exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll  go tell her.&quot; The other two were surprised by his concern about  the person he had fought and punched only few hours earlier, so he  smiled to reassure them, &quot;You're exhausted cause of the run, I  can get to Michiru sooner.&quot; His reason made sense and soon he  left after being instructed about Michiru's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Furuhata  and Mina remained in silence for a minute then he spoke without  looking at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Is  it bad?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't know really, I left out of an impulse. I could only think about  what happened this morning.&quot; She shrugged, &quot;Maybe I'm just  being silly... but... well... Haruka looked so... <em>lost</em> after  that. I don't know... it just seemed to be the right thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Those  words made Furuhata think about the tormented melody he had heard  Michiru playing just a short while before. &quot;I think it's not  silly.&quot; Was his laconic comment.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  thickest part of the forest was already behind her and with that the  need of concentration at every step. That was the cue for her  thoughts to regain possession of her mind. Soon images and sensations  were there accompanying her in her walk. And unbelievably those  thoughts were stronger than her fear of that mysterious and dangerous  forest, or than the excitement for the opportunity of being rescued.
<p>Most  of all Michiru couldn't free herself from the creeping feeling of  rough lips on hers. She had tried hard to ban that from her troubled  mind but nothing had worked. She had tried to justify telling herself  she had hurt Haruka and Seiya with that but she couldn't stop  thinking she was the one who was hurt the most. And it was then, in  the solitude of the forest, that a tear finally made its way down her  cheek almost unnoticed at first.</p>
<p>'Who  am I trying to fool?' She thought bitterly. She felt humiliated and  the worst part was that she had been the one humiliating herself. It  wasn't Jade's fault – he hadn't forced her after all. It wasn't  Seiya's fault, sure he had acted incredibly wrong that morning but he  had tons of excuses for his behavior such as being in a life-treating  situation, or the fact he was in very bad terms with his brothers and  he also had the excuse of being in love – or at least attracted -  to her, in the end he even had the justification of being just  himself always in need to play protagonist and be the star of the  show, that was the only way he knew of living his life.</p>
<p>And  though she had tried to convince herself that way... <em>it wasn't</em> Haruka's fault. The blonde had lied to her – twice – that was  true, but Michiru wasn't shallow, she knew perfectly why Haruka had  lied, why the least thing to do was depriving the small group of  survivors of its meager amount of hopes.  Maybe she would have bothered tell Haruka being the situation  reversed but that that wasn't the point. All of them had made their  own choices and Michiru wasn't an exception... the fact was she had  made the wrong one.</p>
<p>The  one single tear had turned into an actual stream and soon she had to  stop her walk unable to see her own path. She leaned against a tree  and found herself sobbing. All the humiliation, fear, despair and  anger she felt were running down her cheeks along with her tears. In  that right moment she just wanted one thing, she longed... to be  held, comforted, reassured, to be told all was going to be OK. And  her mind started playing tricks on her, giving her the real  impression of two warm arms circling her, a quite soft chest against  her cheek and a warm deep voice telling her words of reassurance...  and a fast heart-beat under her ear. Michiru wasn't an unaware person  either... she knew what – <em>who</em> – she longed for... she just  couldn't explain why.</p>
<p>That  elicited a new sob, all that situation was crazy. She wasn't used to  all that emotional distress, she had spent most of her adult life  trying to shut feelings away. She was too gifted to waste time and  energy with such things and she considered herself lucky being kind  of 'cold', cause she had never found too hard not to get too attached  to people, not even the bunch of boyfriends she had dated during the  years. Of course she couldn't afford 'not to feel' cause she was an  artist and feelings were part of her job, but she was able to let  herself feel just for her art. Being the clever woman she was she was  aware of her being able to feel and that when  she let herself feel she was a better person, that when she let  people and things to <em>touch</em> her deep inside then she was truly  herself but then... more important things would get in the way and  she had given up eventually.</p>
<p>Lately  she was finding harder and harder not to be touched by the horrible  situation she was living and even harder not to be touched by the  people around her.</p>
<p>She  had let herself 'feel' for Hotaru in a surprisingly 'motherly' way,  she felt responsible for the little girl but that had been easy, no  harm from that kid. What she was feeling for Haruka was a total  different matter... It scared her so much she had tried not to think  about it but Seiya kept reminding her with his jealous behavior, his  stupid need of challenging the car-racer over Michiru... but he had  no need to, had he? Whatever Haruka was to her it shouldn't be  comparable with her friendship with Seiya, should it? Then again...</p>
<p>Why...?  Why she had had to act the way she did in order to hurt Haruka? Why  was she so upset about the blonde lying to her? Why did she care so  much? Why couldn't she be her old self, kind but detached?</p>
<p>Michiru  become aware of the rough tree scratching her back every time she  sobbed and then she remembered the reason she was making her way  through the thick wood, she looked at the rucksack by her feet and  recomposed herself. She had a mission to accomplish and she couldn't  let some personal matters getting in the way. If there was one single  thing she had learnt during her life that was discipline...</p>

At  the cave the atmosphere was tense, no one dared to speak out loud and  not just not to disturb the feverish patient. The memory of the last  time someone had been feverish and unconscious was vivid for all of  them, especially for the doctor's young daughter. Ami was tending to  the blonde woman almost obsessively, like her life was depending on  her efforts but she knew that was as far from the truth as possible.  She hated to be of no help, she hated to see people dying  without being able to do a thing about it.
<p>She  was now replacing a fresh wet cloth on the blonde's forehead but the  feverish woman kept turning and tossing making that simple act almost  impossible. It had been an hour now since Haruka's deep sleep had  become a troubled delirious state of unconsciousness, she had even  opened her eyes a couple of times but it was clear she wasn't seeing  anything real, only what was going on in her mind, what her fever was  making her see and live.</p>
<p>'And  it looks like it is nothing pleasant...' The young blue haired girl  thought bitterly as Haruka murmured something incomprehensible  clearly upset and scared. As Ami managed to place the fresh cloth on  her patient's forehead she turned and the cloth was tossed on the  ground for the umpteenth time.</p>
<p>The  groan of frustration caught Kimiko's  attention, she turned towards her daughter and watched as she picked  the cloth up and tried again to place it on Haruka's rebel head.</p>
<p>&quot;We  should strap her down, it'd be much easier you know?&quot; She joked  as she was at her daughter's side. The younger woman looked up at her  with what were helpless eyes then she gave up, and tossed the cloth  back in the half coconut shell they were using as a pot.</p>
<p>Kimiko  then circled Ami's shoulders with her arm and hold her for a minute,  she knew what was in her daughter's mind and heart right now, she had  already been there at the beginning of her own career, when you have  still to learn that doctors can't fix everything and that luck and  faith are a big part of such a job.</p>
<p>The  only one who seemed apparently dealing well with the situation was  Setsuna, the tall mysterious woman had been reading through the  unbelievable huge amounts of notes Souichi Tomoe had had in his  suitcase, she had asked someone to take care of Hotaru and then she  had sit in a corner, it had been hours ago and she hasn't got up once  yet. What the other hadn't noticed were the worried looks she  periodically tossed towards the pallets near the doctor's corner.  There had been a time when she used to know things, when nothing was  new or mysterious to her, back then she had known what was about to  happen right now while they were lost on a strange island... but  those times had gone and she now could only remember with great  frustration that she had known, too bad she couldn't remember <em>what</em>.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;Excuse  me? Nurse! Excuse me, do you speak English?&quot; The blond panting  young man asked in a frenzy.</em>
<p><em>&quot;A  little... What can i do for you?&quot; The pink clothed nurse  answered with a smile.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm  here for my sister, they told me she's here! Her name's Furuhata  Unazuki.&quot; He told her.</em></p>
<p><em>The  middle aged woman typed on her computer and gave him a room number,  unfortunately he run off before she could explain he couldn't see his  sister.</em></p>
<p><em>He  had to find out himself when a sturdy security man blocked him before  he could trespass the Mental Health wing doors of the French hospital  he had reached as soon as he had been able to book a flight seat to  Paris. And that had been right after the weird intercontinental phone  call he had received from a French doctor.</em></p>
<p><em>When  he managed to explain himself he was sent to a doctor who explained  him all about the situation.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Your  sister has been brought in, three days ago after she attempted to  commit suicide. We stopped the bleeding and now she's doing fine and  she'll be able to get out in less than a week.&quot; Furuhata looked  at the young dark haired doctor with a cold expression, she was  shocked, completely shocked. How could his Una-chan doing something  like that? How?</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  can understand this can be shocking for you but i should ask you a  couple of question monsieur Motoki...&quot;  Furuhata could only nod, his mind still clouded by the fact he was in  a hospital thousand of miles away from home and he wasn't able to see  his sister.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Does  your sister has been diagnosed any manic-depressive disorder? Or  maybe you know if there is a reason she should have attempted  suicide?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>'Of  course not! My Una-chan loves life, she lives every day like it's the  last one. She's not depressed, she always try to look out for ups in  life... and she's not euphoric... she's just </em>enthusiastic<em>.  How can you even say something like that?' This was what he  thought... but none of these words left his mouth. He kept looking at  the white dressed doctor not really seeing him, he was just thinking  about his sister, his beloved Unazuki.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Monsieur   Motoki...?&quot; the doctor tried to regain his attention and then  Furuhata shook his head. He shook it and that was his answer to the  doctor's questions: No.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  see...&quot; The doctor said and then motioned the blond man to  follow him along the corridor, and Furuhata followed like a robot,  without words, without changing the dazzled expression on his face  only thinking why... why he hadn't spoken out loud what he had  thought about Unazuki... why he hadn't been  able to convince even his own self that his sister couldn't do such a  thing.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
His  green eyes hurt cause he had spent the last 30 minutes checking out  the horizon from east to west looking for Umino's signal and then  Michiru's. He knew it was foolish cause they hadn't had the time to  get wherever they had to be to place the devices but then again... he  had to look. No matter how the bright blue of the sky hurt his eyes,  he had to be ready.
<p>&quot;OK,  I'm done resting. I'll go back to the caves to see if i can help with  Haruka... I'll wait for Michiru there. Let's hope Seiya can get to  her quickly.&quot; Her words seemed to pass unnoticed by the Japanese  young man. Mina got up from her seat on the sand. &quot;I just can't  stay still waiting for things to happen, it's not my style!&quot;  Mina added winking to a very focused Furuhata, too bad he seemed to  be focused on something that wasn't her. &quot;I'm saying I'm gonna  go!&quot; She added louder and this time she obtained a little bow of  the blond's head. She shrugged and walked away.</p>
<p>Furuhata  had barely noticed her leaving, his look still concentrated on the  green line of the far forest, his mind... thousand of miles away.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Considering  the time spent leaned against the tree Michiru decided she was enough  deep into the forest to start looking for a good spot where to place  the device. Right then she was still surrounded by tall trees and she  didn't see enough room according to Furuhata's instructions.
<p>She  was engrossed in her task when she noticed a noise behind her. The  whooshing of leaves produced by something that didn't care much of  passing unnoticed. Something big... too big to be a rat or something  like that.</p>
<p>'OK,  maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all...' She thought now  totally aware of the impending danger.</p>
<p>The  noise was closer and closer and she started to panic, not knowing  what to do she turn around and picked up a branch from the ground and  hid behind a large tree trunk ready to deliver a blow.</p>
<p>'Who  am I trying to fool...? There's no way I can challenge anything this  way.' Sweatdrops were running down her neck and the grip on the  branch tightened as the noise came closer. She could even begin to  see the bushes being moved off the way by the approaching thing. And  then panic took her over and she dropped the branch and turned around  to run away. That same moment the thing reached her.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally!  I was losing hope to ever find you, Michi-chan!&quot;</p>
<p>It  took her a few seconds to acknowledge the  words and realize their speaker, then she turn around and confronted  him with burning eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;For  Kami's sake Seiya-kun! What were you thinking sneaking  up on people  like that!? You almost gave me an heart attack...&quot; She said then  she started to calm down.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  sorry Michiru-chan, i didn't intend to scare you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  OK, I'm sorry for the outburst.&quot; She sweetened her voice, almost  glad someone was with her at last, like she had just realized how  dangerous it had been on her part to come there through the forest  alone. She kept searching for the right spot comforted by his  presence, not just for some sense of safety but cause it prevented  her to sink back into her thoughts.</p>
<p>Ten  minutes later she found it, a little clearing with a single snag in  the middle of it. With her mind off that matter she decided to  question Seiya about his presence there. Though she had been glad at  first now the disturbing feeling of being stalked and somehow pressed  was back full force.</p>
<p>&quot;What  are you doing here Seiya-san?&quot; her voice ice-cold.</p>
<p>&quot;Mina  sent me to...&quot; At this point her expression turned from hard to  curious, Mina was supposed to be at the cave settling things down,  what was she doing at the beach and what she needed Seiya to be with  her for?</p>
<p>The  dark-haired singer had thought about what to tell Michiru all the  journey through the forest... well, actually he had been deciding  whether tell her or not. He didn't want Michiru to run to the blonde,  he didn't want her to even think about the racer. Why Michiru was so  close to that stranger he couldn't figured, he had seen her crying  earlier that day after having talked with the tall woman. He had  never seen Michiru crying, usually it seemed like nothing could ever  touch her, not good things nor bad ones and then that same morning he  had seen the shimmering tear running down her cheek and after the  initial shock he had found himself grabbing Haruka's shirt's collar  and blowing his fist. He didn't like to remember that episode cause a  shudder kept running down his spine every time he did. He couldn't  deny to himself the idea that someone other than him was able to  affect Michiru in ways he had never seen her affected before. He was  starting to think that was the real reason he had hit the racer for.  Jealousy.</p>
<p>&quot;To  what?&quot; Michiru prompted him to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;To...  help you.&quot; He saw her disapproving look and added, &quot;I  mean... we've all seen it's not safe to be in the forest alone.&quot;  He felt horrible lying to her but he  couldn't let the arrogant bitch spoil his chances with Michiru, he  just couldn't.</p>
<p>&quot;And  you volunteered to be with me, didn't you?&quot; The forest indeed  gave her the creep and she was sure she would never forget the bloody  scene they found on the front part of the plane, but the idea of  being always under his attentive and suffocating watch infuriated  her.</p>
<p>&quot;You  had to take your chance, uh? I managed to elude you for a couple of  hours and you couldn't bear it, could you?&quot;</p>
<p>He  didn't like the direction that conversation was taking, she sounded  furious, her tone kept hardly low while she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  sure there was no other person up to do it and you <em>had to</em>, am  i right Seiya-kun? Cause that would be the only reason for you to be  here... unless you're gone suddenly deaf or dumb and don't know the  meaning of 'leave me alone' anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  see... you rather have someone else here.&quot; He was getting mad  too. Why, why was she slipping away from him more and more every time  they talked?</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe  you're right Seiya-kun!&quot; She said that to hurt him ad from the  look on his handsome face she had succeeded.</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course, everyone's company is better than mine though I'm the one who  know you better and care for you! Yeah, you'd be way happier if that  arrogant bitch was here instead of me! Maybe we could see if she can  make you cry some more, what about that Michiru?&quot; He had raised  his voice, no longer restraining himself. &quot;Too bad she can't be  here, she's passed out on the doc's pallet. Got what she deserved!&quot;  He regretted those word the right moment they left his lips, and not  just for having told Michiru the truth and spoiled his plan but cause  the way he did it, admitting to himself the harsh remark was  uncalled-for.</p>
<p>Michiru  took a minute to process the information then she questioned him  further, &quot;What do you mean? What happened?&quot; All her  composure was gone and again Seiya had to observe that new Michiru:  the caring, worried and pained woman, showing all her feelings on her  porcelain face.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't know all the details, all I know is that Mina-san came to the  beach telling she had passed out and the doc was taking care of her.&quot;  He answered sincerely.</p>
<p>The  young violinist seemed thinking about that for some more seconds  then, made up her mind she took Furuhata's device out of the backpack  and handed it to him.</p>
<p>&quot;You  try and secure it to a tree and then you have to wait a rocket signal  from East and then you have to shoot too.&quot; She explained handing  him the device first then the rockets gun. Then she just turned to  walk away.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan!&quot;  Seiya called her. &quot;You have to hurry, Mina said the doc was  quite worried.&quot; He said, &quot;Don't worry about these, I've got  it.&quot; He added gesturing with the two items in his hands.</p>
<p>Michiru  didn't comment, she only run off through the forest.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
More  than forty minutes had passed since Umino and Michiru had taken off  and Furuhata was more and more excited. He had relentless peered the  east wood-line waiting for the spiked haired boy's signal. Mina had  long gone back to the caves and he had been alone with his thoughts  since then.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>She  seemed alone with her thoughts, nuzzled on the bed, looking outside  the barred window. Her white gown matched the sheets and the  cushioned walls. The whole scene reminded him of a blinding bright  white void. Even his sister's form seemed an empty shell, all the  life ad spirit gone.</em>
<p><em>He  walked closer, his shoes' squeaking sound  deafening in that unreal silence, but she didn't seemed to notice.  Furuhata was finally behind her and only when he circled her thin  shoulders with his arm a little shiver made clear she was a live  person.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Hey,  onee-chan.&quot; His voice was uncertain, having the disturbing  sensation he could have broken her just with the sound of his words.  She looked that fragile at the moment. Instead that very sound seemed  rip her off her catatonic state and with a very slow movement she  turned and looked up at him. Furuhata had to restrain himself from  gasping when he saw her gaunt face and those black rings under her  dull green eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>He  was speechless so he took that dear face in his hands and leaned to  place a soft kiss on her forehead then he encircled her in an embrace  able to express all the words that was failing him at the time. At  first she had remained rigid in his arms but he nonetheless held her  and after a long while he could feel her frame relaxing slowly. Then  she moved her own arms from around her legs to him, it was then that  he could see the white bandaging around her wrists and then a  treacherous tear fell from his eye, fortunately she couldn't see his  face being hers buried in his chest.</em></p>
<p><em>He  kept wondering how things had gone that far, how she had been able to  do such a thing. He was telling himself that wasn't the girl he had  known all his life, that wasn't his sister. But deep inside he  knew... he knew she had always been like that, all her excesses the  good ones and the bad ones. All those huge feelings, great loves and  greatest disappointments, the big enthusiasms and equally bad  failures had been always been inside her, they were part of her.</em></p>
<p><em>'You've  always had a big heart... maybe too big to carry it in this life.' He  thought holding her tightly and as she could hear his thoughts she  cuddled up against his chest even more like a scared child.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>A  long had passed and Furuhata felt it was time to let her go, she had  cried and now she seemed calm again. He slowly loosened his embrace  looking for a sign of disapproval, but nothing happened.</em>
<p><em>&quot;You'll  go back home now, Fu-chan.&quot; Her voice sounded so serene he was  dumbfounded for a moment, like all had been just a horrible  nightmare. He looked down at her and saw a little reassuring smile on  her thin lips, but then her pale face brought him back to reality.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You  can go, I'll be fine now that you've been here.&quot; The smile had  now reached her eyes and a little life seemed to make its way back  there. Furuhata tried to protest but she gestured him to go and he  knew she had made up her mind and knew better that disobey. So he  smiled at her to make her see he had understood. When he was about to  exit the small room she made her last request though it was spoken  out as a statement.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You  won't tell Mom and Dad.&quot; He clenched his fists but didn't turn  around nor he protested and while he walked down the hallway with  tears running now freely down his cheeks he knew he would have done  exactly as she asked.</em></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A muffled blast sound from the east was  followed by the appearance over the wood-line of a thin column of red  smoke and then an explosion of orange light clearly visible in the  darkening eastern sky. Furuhata's heart skipped a beat and soon he  turned to the west where... nothing happened.
<p>He waited and waited but nothing  happened. He waited till the sun completed its way to the western  hills and it was impossible for him to look that way without going  blind.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-san...&quot; He then  whispered terrified.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Michiru run like she hadn't done before  in her entire life. Thanks to the beaten path Rei's grandfather had  marked she had been able to reach the cave in no time. She didn't  even care it was getting darker and darker and the forest more and  more dangerous. Now that the cave's fires were within sight she  relaxed enough to feel her lungs burning from the exertion  nonetheless she sped up – if that's possible – and finally  stopped in front of the entrance.
<p>The smell of fresh-cooked meat and the  soft chatting gave the idea of daily routine but the atmosphere was a  little too heavy. Everyone seemed afraid of raising their voice to a  clearly audible tone. Michiru didn't waste time and without a word  headed to the doctor who was having her scarce dinner with her  daughter. The two of them looked up at the same time and without need  of speaking out loud the older woman got up and escorted Michiru  behind a makeshift screen they had set with some towels.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey...&quot; Setsuna's voice came  unexpected cause Michiru hadn't noticed the woman sat a couple of  feet away. She seemed captivated by the wretched form laying in front  of her: Haruka laid on her back, half covered by a blanket and  despite the little fire crackling not far away and the natural heat  she was shivering, her breaths were shallow and labored, and every  now and then she seemed to murmur unintelligible words. Her fists  held the blanket in a mortal grip, her knuckles white and the muscles  on her forearms stiff; her face was a similar picture of tension, the  jaw clenched, the eyes shut tightly and her brows furrowed like she  was engaged in some kind of effort.</p>
<p>As the wet cloth on Haruka's forehead  fell, Michiru kneeled down and replaced it after having refreshened  it.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened?&quot; She asked  never averting her look from the increasingly irrequieted blonde.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor thinks she's pushed herself  too hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Setsuna said while Michiru tried to brush  the blond rebelling locks off the damp forehead. Her delicate fingers  felt even cooler against the feverish skin.</p>
<p>&quot;And what do <em>you</em> think?&quot;  She asked turning to look straight into the garnet eyes.</p>
<p>Setsuna wasn't surprised by the  significant look of the violinist's eyes, she suspected Michiru had  sensed some sort of connection among the three of them – better  said the four of them, Hotaru not to be excluded.</p>
<p>&quot;I <em>think</em> the doctor's right  and... I <em>know for sure</em> she...&quot; and indicated Haruka,  &quot;hasn't got more than a couple of hour of sleep since the  crashdown, and who knows about before that.&quot; She paused then  continued, &quot;Things had been hard for all of us lately. But she's  strong, she can make it.&quot; She concluded reassuringly.</p>
<p>Michiru looked down again, Haruka was  wiggling and the cloth had fallen once again. The young musician  patiently replaced it but the blonde kept moving and it fell again.  The car-racer was now tossing back and forth, her legs and arms  trembling violently, she even mumbled something unintelligible more  and more agitated.</p>
<p>When Michiru picked up the cloth once  again Setsuna exclaimed, &quot;It's futile until she's calmed down.&quot;  But Michiru didn't give up, instead she leant down and caressed  Haruka's cheek with her cold hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Shh... It's ok, it's ok. Easy...  shh...&quot; She kept soothing the blonde and in a couple of minutes  the trembling subsided. &quot;That's my girl... here...&quot; Michiru  whispered to the blonde's ear while placing the fresh cloth on her  forehead unaware of the soft smile on Setsuna's lips.</p>
<p>After a while the older woman stood up  telling she was going to check on Hotaru. The aqua-haired girl  remained at Haruka's bedside, and when the feverish racer tensed up  again she took one of the larger hands in her own and caressed it,  she could still see the bruises on the knuckles but beside that the  skin seemed soft and delicate and somehow that little detail warmed  Michiru's heart. Like she had noticed for the first time how fragile  and feminine Haruka was, how vulnerable she seemed in that state.  Despite the straight nose and the strong line of her chin which gave  her a noble appearance, without the charm of her teal eyes Haruka  looked like a...</p>
<p>'...a sleeping child.' Michiru thought.  'You make someone want to protect you, like you need that!' She  thought with a smile. 'Maybe you just need to be protected from your  own self.' She considered remembering the doctor's diagnosis.</p>
<p>Delicate violinist's fingers made their  way again to the blonde's now calm features and lingered on the  swelled nose, and Michiru found herself suddenly remembering that  very morning's events. And remembering how she had felt about the  blonde and Seiya, but mostly about Haruka and she was suddenly aware  that she hadn't been able to banish the thought of her from her mind  for more than few minutes.</p>
<p>'I don't know why I let you hurt me this  way, why I allow you to affect me so much. I wish I knew...'</p>
<p>&quot;What have you done to me?&quot; She  whispered for no one to hear, not even the now peacefully sleeping  Haruka.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The sun has started to setting when Seiya  regained consciousness, as he opened his eyes he remembered what had  happened, not that he was so sure. He remembered taking the device  from Michru and trying to climb on the trunk in front of him to  secure it and then he had heard a noise from the bushes but before he  could get a glimpse behind him the world had turned black. Now he was  trying to get up when a dull pain from the back of his head remind  him the probable cause of his passing out. And it hit him, where was  the device?
<p>He sat up and turn around and here it  was, shattered in a million pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;Son of a bitch!&quot; He hissed  standing up. He masseged his sore nape and collected the racksack  then he looked worried at the impending darkness from east and  realized he had to rush back to the beach as soon as possible, but  during the whole journey he couldn't keep himself from wondering what  or... <em>who</em> could have done that to him.</p>
<p>End  of Chapter 7.</p>
<p><strong>Author's  note:</strong> I hope Michiru's behavior wasn't  too much out of character though I tried to give reasons for her to  act as she did.</p>
