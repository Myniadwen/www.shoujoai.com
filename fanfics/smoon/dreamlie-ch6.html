Her downfall

No good, stop her&#133;.

Them

-Huh? I don&#146;t get it&#133;what downfall? Who&#146;s?&#133;..Answer!-

&#147; Downfall, downfall, Downfall, DOWNFALL

Her downfall

Her majesties downfall&#148;

He finally saw it. A lone figure in the shadows. Talking to him.

-Who&#146;s downfall?-

&#147; Her majesties downfall,

It can be stopped,

You can stop it.

King Endymion can stop it,

Stop them.&#148;

-Stop what? The downfall? Of who? Stop whom? Please answer my 
questions!- 

The figure smiled gently. It walked forward, shrouded in darkness. The 
figure looked at him, eyes full of determination.

&#147; Her majesties downfall,

Queen Terrestria&#146;s downfall

King Endymion can stop this,

Stop his sister.

He can break them

Separate them,

Save her.&#148;

-Terri&#146;s downfall&#133;break them? Do you mean save her from Rei?-

&#147; Saver her

The kingdoms will cry,

Because one&#146;s Queen has died,

Death by a certain person,

Who said 3 words,

Then 2 words&#148;

&#147; The black loves the red,

But does the red love the black?

No heir will be born,

No possible way.

King Endymion can stop this,

Stop them,

King Endymion can save her.&#148;

- I can? How?-

&#147; King Endymion can stop this,

Stop them,

Save her.&#148;

&#147; King Endymion can save Queen Terrestria,

Break them,

Separate them.&#148;

The figure looked pleading, hope in it&#146;s eyes. Eyes that he couldn&#146;t 
tell the color.

&#147; Will King Endymion save her?

Break them?

Separate them?

He can save her,

The only one,

The right will come,

Right for her,

She has to just wait.

Will King Endymion save her?&#148;

- Save her? Yes, I will. Break Terri and Rei right?-

The figure nods, then smiles happily. And just as it came, was gone.

~~~~~End Dream~~~~~

Darien shot up in bed. Small beads of sweat on his forehead. He laid 
back as Serena stirred and woke up.

- I can stop them. Rei won&#146;t bring my little sister&#146;s downfall.-

&#147; Darien? What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147; Nothing, just a bad dream. Go back to sleep Sere.&#148;

&#147; O.K.&#148; After a few minutes both slipped back into dream land.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Next Day*

No one had seen Terri for two weeks now. The only ones who had were 
Serena and Darien, and that was for only 30 minutes. But today they 
would all be together. They had planned for days. They were skipping 
royal duties and have a day in the park. And at this point all they 
needed was the Planet Princess and her panther-like guardian.

&#147; You know I&#146;m beginning to wonder if she&#146;s as bad as Serena?&#148; Serena 
gave a well earned glare at Lita while everyone else laughed. A second 
later Terri walked out of the portal with Taref. She was decked out in 
an orange t-shirt, jean short shorts, sneakers, and a pair of 
sunglasses.

&#147; Hey guys! Long time no see!&#148; She walked over to her brother first, 
as Luna and Artemis went over to Taref. ( Ha! Finally got them in!) 
Amara looked at Terri, then Rei with a mischievous grin. 

&#147; Wow. Hey Rei wanna trade girlfriends?&#148;

Terri giggled as Rei put a protective arm around her waist. Then more 
giggling as Michelle smacked Amara in the back of the head. 

&#147; Come on lets go! I wanna see how high Taref can jump for a Frisbee!&#148; 
Hotaru ran out of the portal room waving the Frisbee. Taref hot on her 
heels, while Luna tried to stay on his back. 

15 minutes later they were set up in the park. Hotaru was playing 
Frisbee with Taref, Artemis, Luna, Setsuna, &amp; Mina. Lita, Ami, Serena, 
Darien, Amara, &amp; Michelle were playing a game of Soccer. Terri &amp; Rei 
were climbing about in the big oak their picnic blanket was under. 

&#147; Come on Rei, can&#146;t you catch me?&#148; Terri grinned at her love, five 
branches away.

&#147; Of course. Just gotta think how first.&#148; Terri laughed.

&#147; Just don&#146;t take too long Firebird. The faster you catch me, the 
better.&#148; She grinned again and started climbing higher and faster. Rei 
soon had only one or two branches between her dragon and herself. She 
had a half n&#146; hour to catch Terri. Chasing was fun, but so was 
kissing. After five minutes Rei went the other direction. Taking 
shelter in the leaves. Terri looked behind her, finding no Rei.

- Uh oh&#133;. I know this tactic. The victim always loses&#133;.- As if on cue, 
a red clad blur swept down from above. Grabbing Terri by the waist and 
swinging like Tarzan (or is it Jane?). Then swinging back up on a 
branch.

&#147; Oooo! Look what I caught!&#148; Rei chuckled as Terri tried to breath. 
After calming down, Rei adjusted Terri in her lap.

&#147; Dragon, chasing you is not an easy feet.&#148;

&#147; All in good fun Firebird.&#148; Terri closed the gap between them and for 
the first time in two weeks, kissed Rei. They were up there for 
another twenty minutes before it was time for lunch.

&#147; Hey chimps formally known as Rei and Terri! Climb yourselves down 
for lunch.&#148;

Rei came down first, arms open. A few seconds later Terri landed in 
her girlfriend&#146;s strong arms, and carried over to the others. Lita 
just shook her head and sat next to her blue haired girlfriend. 

The food was unpacked as conversations started. Terri and Rei acting 
like the playful lovebirds they were. Which in turn earned glares from 
Darien. He was caught many times, getting questioning stares from his 
wife and sister. 

&#147; Well I&#146;m finished. Anyone else done?&#148; Terri looked around and 
noticed Hotaru was done. Poking the 17 year olds shoulder she yelled &#147; 
Your it!&#146; and ran. Hotaru quickly going after her. Soon everyone was 
engaged in the game of Tag. 45 minutes later they picked up and headed 
home.

The Queen of Mars walked silently behind her escort. Her billowy red 
gown trailing behind her. King Endymion had called for a meeting with 
her at the Crystal Palace. The escort turned to face her. 

&#147; I leave you here your highness. King Endymion is just over that 
bridge, in the Rose Garden.&#148;

&#147; Yes, thank you Sir.&#148; He bowed and left.

King Endymion was seated at a table and motioned for her to join him. 
A servant poured them some tea and left. 

&#147; Good evening Queen Rei.&#148;

&#147; Good evening King Endymion.&#148;

&#147; Do you know why I have called you here?&#148; Rei shook her head.

&#147; My sister.&#148; One of her eyebrows arched.

&#147; Terrestria? Is something wrong with her?&#148;

&#147; No, but I&#146;m worried for her future.&#148; 

&#147; Her future?&#148;

&#147; Yes, I&#146;m afraid changes must be made.&#148;

&#147; What type of changes?&#148;

&#147; Just one. A change in her relationship with you. You aren&#146;t allowed 
to date her any more.&#148; Shock and surprise crossed her face. Staying 
put as she put her cup down.

&#147; What are you talking about? That isn&#146;t for you to decide!&#148;

&#147; I&#146;m simply trying to protect her from ruin! There won&#146;t be an heir 
to the kingdom if you marry! I won&#146;t let that happen!

&#147; No heir? Then what about the others? There are ways to have children 
Endymion!&#148;

&#147; Rei, don&#146;t you care for the future? You and this relationship will 
cause her downfall! She can&#146;t have that! If she were to die because of 
something tied to you, the Universe would fall under! Do you hear me? 
Break up!&#148; They were both standing at this point. Endymion flushed red 
with anger. Rei trying to refrain from punching him and crying.

&#147; Alright &#146;King&#146; Endymion. Since you are the husband of my Queen, then 
I must obey your orders. Do not expect anything but coldness from me. 
I&#146;ll let you explain to Dra- I mean Queen Terrestria why. Good day 
your Majesty.&#148; The Queen of Mars curtseyed and left. Letting her tears 
flow after getting over the bridge and walking faster. She bumped into 
Serenity at the entrance to the Palace. 

&#147; Rei? What&#146;s wrong?&#148; Worry etched into her gentle features.

&#147; Ask that bastard you call a husband.&#148; Rei went towards the Portal 
room then, heading straight for Terrestrial. A servant told her that 
Terrestria was in the Drawing room. 

There she found Terri working on a men&#146;s pant suit with two of her 
employees. 

&#147; Terrestria?&#148; the silver- chestnut haired beauty looked up and her 
face brightened. She quickly hugged Rei, who went rigid at contact. 

&#147; Terrestria, I need to talk to you alone please?&#148; Terrestria looked 
at her in confusion.

&#147; Yes, ok. Laurena, Tai take a 10 minute break please.&#148; They nodded 
and left.

&#147; What is it Rei?&#148;

&#147; I can&#146;t see you anymore Terrestria.&#148;

&#147; Rei?&#148;

&#147; I&#146;m&#133;we have to break up.&#148; 

Tears came to both their eyes. Terri&#146;s the only one&#146;s spilling while 
Rei looked away.

&#147; Don&#146;t you love me?&#148;

&#147; If I answer that I can&#146;t leave her single.&#148;

&#147; Then, I don&#146;t get it Rei. Why?&#148;

&#147; Ask your brother. Good day Queen Terrestria.&#148; As Rei left for Mars, 
Terri&#146;s legs gave. She fell, letting her sobs take over.

- Why? If she still loves me, why? Brother&#133;what have you done?-</pre>
