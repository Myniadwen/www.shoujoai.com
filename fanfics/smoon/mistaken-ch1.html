<h1>Mistaken</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Time is a funny thing.

It passes so quickly that sometimes it feels like it&#39;s
not there at all. Then at other times, it can drag on and on,
seeming to be neverending. But despite how time would
present itself, one fact always remained.

It was there and it always passed.

Every year it was the same for Makoto. Time
would pass and the date, it would sneak up on her. The
date that she hated more than any other.

The date of her parents death.

That crash, it still haunted her dreams, her life in
ways that no one could possibly imagine. She knew deep
down as hard as she tried to push the pain away, it would
show in her daily life, in her very personality.

Nothing is more devastating to a child than the loss
of a parent, much less the loss of both parents. Makoto
knew she&#39;d never really get over it... and the sharp pain of
it had long since turned into a dull ache in her heart.

Still, it stayed with her.

When the date finally arrived, Makoto went
through her routine methodically. She had several years
experience, after all. Shower, dress, take the long and
leisurely walk to the cemetery, stop at the small flower
shop a block before it, place flowers at her parents grave
site and tell them all that&#39;s gone on that year.

Except this year it was different. This time her
routine wasn&#39;t as methodical as she thought it would be.
Because this time someone was waiting for her when she
neared the entrance to the cemetery.

Blinking at the figure before her, Makoto
wondered what she of all people was doing there. She
realized her friends probably knew this date as well as she
did but before now none of them had... well, done this.

None of them had shown up at the cemetery. It
wasn&#39;t something she expected or even wanted. Part of her
needed solitude on this date. To be alone with all of her
memories of them as she shared her deepest secrets.

Which was why Makoto wasn&#39;t quite sure how to
react upon seeing Rei standing at the cemetery gate.
Which is also why Rei was the first one to speak.

&quot;Surprised?&quot; Rei offered somewhat wryly, her
voice and very demeanor hesitant in nature.

&quot;Rei-chan? What are you doing here?&quot; asked
Makoto, finally finding her voice and relieved to hear it
sounding much more understanding than she expected.

Rei gazed at Makoto for a long moment, deciding
something inwardly before she stepped forward and
pressed something into the taller girl&#39;s palm.

Dark purple eyes bore steadily into shining green
ones as Rei murmured, &quot;My mother died when I was little.
Sometimes I can barely remember her face and I wonder if
she really existed, it seems so long ago. My father may not
be dead but I never see him. I haven&#39;t even talked to him in
over two years. I think because of that maybe I know a bit
of what you went through when you lost your parents.&quot;
Rei pulled away from Makoto in a light and graceful
movement, her hands warming the other girl&#39;s as she
smiled softly. &quot;I just wanted to tell you that I understand
and I&#39;m here if you ever need to talk about it.&quot;

With one last smile, Rei turned on her heel and
walked away from Makoto, knowing that the other girl
needed and wanted that solitude today. And as she walked
away, Makoto opened up her closed palm to look at the
protection amulet that Rei had pressed there.

Lifting her gaze to look at Rei&#39;s departing figure,
Makoto whispered in husky tones, &quot;Thank you.&quot; 

---

The next day things seemed to go back to normal.
When at school Makoto made small talk with Ami,
Minako, and Usagi, but all the while her mind was on Rei
and what she said to her at the cemetery.

That she&#39;d be there if she ever needed to talk.

Really talk about it. Discuss her parents death and
what it did to her. How it changed her life, how because of
it she couldn&#39;t go back to the carefree girl she once was.

All she could do was pretend she felt that way and
even that was hollow to Makoto. She was sick of it, of
holding it in, of pretending she was over it.

Could she ever really be over it? Somehow she
doubted it, especially since she hadn&#39;t once talked to
anyone about their deaths.

Makoto didn&#39;t know why it was that way, but she
did know she wanted to talk to Rei about it. No, she
needed to talk to Rei about it. Rei who had lost her own
mother as a child, Rei who never got to see her own
father.

Rei who understood her.

That was why Makoto left for their usual study
session early and headed over to the temple to see Rei.
Quietly walking up the steps, she smiled on feeling the
wind fly through her hair and gazed at the blue sky above.

&quot;Pretty day,&quot; murmured Makoto, shading her eyes
just slightly to look at the expanse of the sky.

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

Freezing in her study of the sky, Makoto slowly
moved her eyes down as they locked on the figure of Rei
standing at the top of the steps, broom in hand. She was in
a pair of worn jeans, simple black shirt, and tennis shoes.
It made her look achingly innocent, much more so than
what Makoto knew her to be. 

Something about it made Makoto&#39;s heart jump.

Blinking dimly, Makoto laughed, rubbing the back
of her head with one hand while the other held up her bag
full of goodies. &quot;I made your favorite,&quot; she began.

&quot;You made sushi?&quot; Rei asked in teasing tones,
quirking an elegant black eyebrow as she said this. &quot;Really,
Mako-chan, you shouldn&#39;t have gone to all that trouble.&quot;

&quot;Funny,&quot; replied Makoto dryly, walking up the last
step to stand in front of Rei. &quot;Nope, I made some of those
cookies that you like.&quot;

&quot;The little thin ones with melted chocolate in the
center?&quot; asked Rei, her eyes lighting up at the prospect.

&quot;Those are the ones,&quot; Makoto chuckled. &quot;Here,&quot;
she continued, presenting the bag to Rei. &quot;Why don&#39;t you
snag a few for yourself before Usagi gets here and eats
them all.&quot;

Taking the bag carefully from the taller girl, Rei
looked up at Makoto. &quot;But this isn&#39;t why you came here so
early, is it?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;No,&quot; said Makoto, just as softly. &quot;It isn&#39;t.&quot;

Nodding quietly, Rei paused before she gently
leaned her broom against the nearby temple wall. She
turned back to face Makoto and in a slow, deliberate,
movement Rei reached out to take Makoto&#39;s hand in her
own then led her into the temple.

She had walked through these halls a hundred
times before but somehow, today it felt different to
Makoto and she felt nervous. It was just Rei, so why did
she feel this way? All they were going to do was talk...

Talk about their parents.

A frown now marred Makoto&#39;s pretty features,
making her look stern as she followed Rei into her room.
The look was something that Rei immediately noticed.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t wear that expression,&quot; Rei
murmured, studying Makoto with careful eyes. &quot;Serious
just doesn&#39;t suit you at all, Mako-chan.&quot;

Makoto gave a derisive snort as a small smile
played upon her lips. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t talk if I were you,&quot; she
said. &quot;You often look the same way.&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; admitted Rei. She sat on her bed as
Makoto watched her closely. She sighed then was quiet
for a long while before she said, &quot;Even though I can hardly
remember my mother, I still miss her. Sometimes I think of
how my life would&#39;ve been different if she didn&#39;t die. I&#39;d be
with them now, instead of living with Grandpa, and maybe
instead of being known as that strange psychic girl for all
these years I would just be their daughter...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not strange, Rei-chan,&quot; said Makoto
quietly. Rei lifted her gaze on hearing this as Makoto
approached and smiled at her then sat down on the bed. &quot;I
think what you can do is amazing and I bet your mother
would too. She grew up at this temple, didn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she did,&quot; Rei said softly. She looked out the
open door to her room, at the nature surrounding the
temple while she spoke. &quot;She loved it here. I don&#39;t think
she liked living in the city very much... far away from the
flowers, trees, and other growing things.&quot;

&quot;I think,&quot; Makoto began rather hesitantly, reaching
out to gently hold and squeeze Rei&#39;s hand. &quot;That wherever
your mother is, she&#39;s looking down at you and she&#39;s happy
that you&#39;re here. The place that she loved the most.&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; whispered Rei in hoarse tones that
were laced with tears. Her gaze was still fixed forward as
she looked outside the doors and Makoto could sense that
she was trying to get a hold of herself. Rei turned around
to face her and eyes still shining, she said, &quot;Tell me about
your parents. What were they like?&quot;

&quot;My mother was beautiful,&quot; said Makoto, her eyes
clouding over as she remembered. &quot;She was beautiful and
I remember when I was little I wanted so much to be just
like her. With her voice so gentle and kind, she always had
the perfect answer for any of my questions. My dad,&quot; her
voice was rough with emotion, &quot;He was more playful and
we&#39;d have fun with games. My mom used to chastise him
for getting me dirty but I loved it so much...&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t like this when they were alive,&quot; Makoto
continued, not appearing to have heard Rei say her name.
&quot;When they died, I was crushed, I just didn&#39;t know what to
do with myself. Life went on and I went through all the
motions. After awhile I decided I had to get over it,
because they wouldn&#39;t want me to be a zombie for all of
my life. So I tried hard to feel things again, to let emotions
back into my heart, but it was fake and wrong...&quot; Shaking
her head a bit, she let out a choked sob. &quot;But I did keep
one thing they told me close to my heart. Everyone should
be treated equally, no one is better than someone else. It&#39;s
why I got into so much trouble early on, I guess. I didn&#39;t
turn out like my mother, charming people with my words,
and I didn&#39;t have my father&#39;s grace... so whenever I saw a
person being picked on I just acted.&quot; Laughing dryly, she
looked over at Rei and said, &quot;Hence all the fights.&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; repeated Rei softly. She reached out
to lightly cup the other girl&#39;s chin in her hand so their eyes
would meet. &quot;They&#39;re proud of you and all that you&#39;ve
done, I know that they are.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Makoto whispered, entranced by Rei and
the power she held at this moment. &quot;How do you know?&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; Rei began in the softest and most
loving of tones as she moved her hand to gently push back
a strand of hair behind Makoto&#39;s ear. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you.&quot;

Makoto closed her eyes at this and let out a shaky
breath then murmured, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; responded Rei.

&quot;You know,&quot; Makoto chuckled quietly as she
opened her eyes but focused them on Rei&#39;s bed spread. &quot;I
seem to be saying that a lot to you lately, Rei-chan.&quot;

&quot;Well, I have done a lot to be thanked for,&quot; Rei
began in playful tones, her eyes sparkling. &quot;Being friends
with someone as tough and solitary as you isn&#39;t easy.&quot;

&quot;Tough? Solitary?&quot; Makoto echoed, wearing an
expression of indignation. &quot;I prefer to think of myself as a
stoic iron willed warrior of justice.&quot;

&quot;Iron muscled, you mean,&quot; Rei teased further.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; growled Makoto in threatening tones,
her hands reaching out towards the other girl with a look
of menace in her green eyes. &quot;You&#39;re going to get it!&quot;

When the other Senshi arrived for their usual study
session they found Makoto and Rei, still in the midst of the
oddest looking tickle fight any of them had ever seen.

Still, it was nice to see the both of them smiling.
They had both been so serious lately. Even if they were
smiling about being in very curiously ecchi positions.

But who were they to question it?

---

Two weeks now.

For two weeks now Makoto left her apartment
early so she could talk with Rei before the others arrived
for their study sessions. In those two weeks they had
talked about not just their parents but everything under the
sun.

Everything except one very important thing.

Neither of them was really sure how to broach the
subject of love and being in it to the other girl. They were
both brave people, that much was for certain, but for some
reason when it came to love they were afraid.

Afraid of what it caused in the both of them. Afraid
of how it made them feel. Even afraid of who they loved...

But their tradition carried on.

Which is why Makoto wasn&#39;t too surprised to see
Rei standing on her doorstep a half an hour before their
study session. It had been moved to her apartment for the
week as Rei and her Grandfather were busy with preparing
the temple for an upcoming festival. The entire group all
decided studying there would be distracting.

Besides Rei, it was Makoto who had the most
peaceful and private living environment. Perhaps because
it was she who lived all alone.

&quot;Rei-chan,&quot; said Makoto with a smile as she
opened the door and gazed at the priestess. Rei held her
book bag gently in her hands and gave Makoto a soft smile
in return before walking into the apartment. &quot;Do you want
some tea? I&#39;m making my favorite kind.&quot;

&quot;I like rose tea too,&quot; Rei murmured, placing her
bag carefully on the floor, leaning it up against Makoto&#39;s
couch. &quot;I&#39;d love to have some.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; Makoto said happily, turning
on her heel to walk into the kitchen and fix their drinks.
&quot;Make yourself at home while I get everything ready.&quot;

Makoto was still busily pouring the tea then
arranging it on a tray when she felt a light touch grace her
backside and froze at the sensation it caused in her. It felt
as if a line of fire was blazing up the small of her back and
an incredible sense of warmth filled her entire being.

Breathing shakily, Makoto slowly turned around to
face Rei who was looking up at her with a lost expression
of need on her sculptured features. 

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; whispered Makoto as she looked
down at Rei with some trepidation. &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Your sempai,&quot; Rei interrupted quietly. &quot;Do you
love him still? Did you ever love him, Mako-chan?&quot;

Blinking at this, Makoto tried to get control of
herself. This is how it sometimes went with her and Rei,
they would just blurt questions from out nowhere. It didn&#39;t
really matter why the questions were being asked, all that
mattered was that they knew no matter what they would
be told the truth in response.

&quot;I... I thought I loved him,&quot; confessed Makoto,
turning away from Rei as she went back to arranging the
tea on the tray. She paused to deposit a half spoonful of
sugar as she knew Rei liked, then continued, &quot;Now that I
think back on it, I wonder if I really did love him. I was so
young and trying so hard to recover from the loss of my
parents. I think that maybe I made myself love him, just to
have those feelings again. To finally care for someone else
and not have that emptiness in my heart anymore.&quot;

Makoto quietly picked up the tray with their tea
and a few cookies on it then walked into the living room,
knowing Rei was trailing behind her, watching her every
move with those attentive eyes.

&quot;He left me though,&quot; Makoto murmured, she gave
a dry, harsh, laugh as she reached for her cup of tea then
took a sip from it. &quot;Just like they left me. But at least when
they left, it wasn&#39;t their choice, not really. Not so with him,
he wanted to get away from me... from my love.&quot; Placing
the cup down with a hard clink of ceramic on the glass of
the coffee table, Makoto looked up at Rei and gave a wan
smile. &quot;He never said why it was over but I think maybe he
wanted someone more feminine. Someone who wasn&#39;t so
guarded about their past and their emotions.&quot; Shaking her
head a bit, Makoto said softly, &quot;I can&#39;t really blame him.&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Rei breathed. She took a small step
forward, her hand reaching out towards the other girl only
to freeze when Makoto lifted her head to lock their eyes.

&quot;Now,&quot; began Makoto strongly, her stare holding
Rei absolutely still. &quot;Tell me about who you love,
Rei-chan. Will you ever let her know how you feel?&quot;

Closing her eyes painfully, Rei felt a shudder run
through her entire body. Of course Makoto knew about it,
about how she felt. They had talked about so much in the
course of these two weeks, they had gotten so close and
Makoto... she wasn&#39;t like her.

She wasn&#39;t blind to what was right in front of her.

&quot;Never,&quot; Rei said in the softest of tones. Her eyes
opened to steadily meet Makoto&#39;s. At her side, her hands
were clenched into fists as she trembled with fright from
talking about something she thought wouldn&#39;t ever see the
light of day. &quot;I will never let her know, if she doesn&#39;t know
already. Usagi belongs with Mamoru, we all know that.&quot;

&quot;She loves you though,&quot; reminded Makoto kindly. 

Rei squeezed her eyes shut on hearing this. &quot;She
loves all of us,&quot; Rei enforced strongly. &quot;But it isn&#39;t the
same as how she feels about him. He is her destiny and I&#39;m
not going to try and change that.&quot;

When she opened her eyes, Rei found Makoto had
abandoned her seat on the couch and was standing before
her with a look of total understanding. Transfixed, Rei
watched as hands she knew to be so fierce and strong in
battle tenderly reached out to caress her cheek.

Leaning into the touch without helping it, Rei
released a soft sigh of contentment. Makoto&#39;s touch was
cool against her hot skin. Her touch was just like her,
electric and powerful in the reactions it caused.

&quot;We have a destiny too, Rei-chan,&quot; murmured
Makoto, tipping up Rei&#39;s head so their eyes would meet.
&quot;Not just as Senshi, but as human beings. I want you to
know that you&#39;re a part of mine now.&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Rei whispered.

The moment was endless and perfect as Rei closed
her eyes and tilted her head back, offering her lips, herself,
up to the girl who stood before her. The girl who now
knew her better than any other.

Smiling softly, Makoto leaned forward to partake
of this offering when a sudden noise interrupted them.

The noise of a knock on the front door. Soon
accompanied by the shouts of Usagi and Minako asking if
she was home and Ami chastising them both.

Makoto reluctantly pulled away from Rei and
sighed deeply as she gazed down at her. &quot;Another time?&quot;
she asked gently, wanting reassurance that she hadn&#39;t just
imagined what was happening between them.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rei nodded softly, a coy smile soon
spreading across her lips. &quot;Definitely.&quot;

This action only made Makoto wish the loud
shouts she was hearing outside of her apartment weren&#39;t
really occurring and they were truly alone. No, not alone
because now they had each other.

But still, they both longed for that time alone. Just
so they could explore these new feelings for each other.

They would soon have their wish.

---

The park was lovely at this time of the day. It was right before 
sunset, when most people were heading home or were at home 
already, eating dinner.

Because of this they knew full well the park would
be empty and they&#39;d have it all to themselves. It had taken
more time than they thought, arranging this. Lately, it was
as if their friends were with them every second, making the
time they wanted alone harder and harder to achieve.

Of course, they both knew that they could easily
get the others to back off by simply telling them what was
going on between them. Except that they weren&#39;t sure
what they could even tell them.

What was happening remained a mystery to them
and all they really knew was that they wanted to be alone
with one another to figure it all out.

The problem was, being alone was more difficult
than it sounded. But still, they had managed it somehow.

Makoto was shaking out the blanket to place it on
the grass while Rei stood further up on the hill, watching
the sun as it slowly set in the distance. They still had at
least a half an hour of dim sunlight left and that was
enough for them to have a nice picnic dinner as planned.

&quot;I like sunsets more than sunrises,&quot; Rei admitted
with a smile, tilting her head back to observe Makoto who
was busily setting their paper plates on the blanket.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Makoto looked up and gave Rei a teasing
grin. &quot;Maybe because you only see sunrises when you&#39;re
half asleep since you wake up at such ungodly hours.&quot;

&quot;Meditation is best in the morning,&quot; sniffed Rei,
folding her arms across her chest defiantly. &quot;Besides, I like
the sunsets because they happen just before night. It&#39;s just
so much more peaceful at night than during the day...&quot;

&quot;It is, isn&#39;t it?&quot; agreed Makoto, pulling out the last
of the food before she lifted her head to look at Rei who
was studying the sunset again. Her long hair flew lightly in
the wind along with the stylish red and black dress she had
on. Makoto was quiet for a long while, simply taking in
the beauty before her, then said, &quot;I think it&#39;s got something
to do with everyone going home for the day. People seem
to be responsible for disrupting any peace Earth has.&quot;

Arching an eyebrow at this, Rei said in rather lofty
tones, &quot;I know that! I happen to be a--&quot;

Whatever Rei was going to say next was silenced
as she felt strong arms encircle her waist and a jolt of pure
sensation rippled through her body. Relaxing back against
the trim body that held her close, she sighed softly. This
was no time for her to get angry or give lectures. She was
here to have fun and most importantly, be with Makoto.

&quot;Come eat,&quot; Makoto murmured in Rei&#39;s ear, her
husky voice echoing in her heart and mind, her breath hot
on the priestess&#39; skin, causing shivers to run through her.
&quot;I don&#39;t have sushi, but I did make some of your other
favorites.&quot; Rei peered up into Makoto&#39;s strong features
that looked so gentle and kind in the dying light of day. &quot;If
you&#39;re a good girl, I might even feed them to you.&quot;

&quot;Now how,&quot; began Rei in playfully sensuous tones
as her eyes twinkled, &quot;could I resist an offer like that?&quot;

Makoto didn&#39;t reply and instead, smiled wide then
pulled away to take Rei&#39;s hand in her own as she led her to
the blanket she&#39;d arranged on the grass. Quietly, she put all
the food on their plates then set her own aside and reached
her fork out to stab at a piece of food on Rei&#39;s plate.

Holding out the fork and the food on the end of it
for Rei, she smirked then said, &quot;Say ahhh.&quot;

Scowling slightly, Rei nonetheless opened her
mouth and took the food and fork into it, pulling away
when she was done. Makoto watched as the other girl
carefully chewed the food. She was about to make a stab
at another piece when Rei&#39;s hands clasped her own,
stopping her from doing so.

Looking into Rei&#39;s eyes, Makoto found herself
captured in their depths, frozen as Rei moved to take the
food in her own fingers and held them lightly before
Makoto&#39;s mouth.

Smiling at this, Makoto didn&#39;t hesitate and she
leaned forward, taking the food and Rei&#39;s fingers into her
mouth, sucking on them gently before pulling back.

And as she chewed on her meal, Makoto couldn&#39;t
help but feel just a bit triumphant on seeing the dazed look
on her Rei&#39;s features. Her eyes crinkling up a bit, Makoto
murmured, &quot;No more playing, Rei-chan. If we keep this up
we&#39;ll forget to really eat and end up starving.&quot;

&quot;Party pooper,&quot; Rei accused lightly, her eyes both
disappointed and relieved on hearing Makoto&#39;s words.

As much as she wanted this, wanted Makoto&#39;s
touch, to feel that connection deep in her soul, Rei almost
felt overwhelmed when it finally occurred. Looking in
those deep green eyes, endless and wise, feeling the hot
warmth of Makoto&#39;s lips on her skin...

It was the most incredible thing Rei ever felt.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Makoto, laughing softly as she
scooted over to sit next to Rei. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t tease you.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Rei replied, tossing her hair over her
shoulder but smiling while she looked at Makoto through
lidded eyes. &quot;You really shouldn&#39;t.&quot;

They then proceeded ate the remainder of their
meal in compatible silence as they watched the sunset.
That was another thing that they both appreciated. The
fact that not only could they be comfortable talking about
anything together, but they could also feel completely at
ease when in one another&#39;s presence.

There was no pressure to hide who they were
anymore. No fear of simply being themselves. All they
needed was each other and that was enough.

Soon they finished their meal and the sun had set in
the distance. Makoto sat leaning back into the tree behind
them, one leg stretched out and the other pulled against
her body. Rei had somehow ended up sitting between
those long legs, her back pressed into the warmth of
Makoto&#39;s chest as she gently rested her face against the
side of the kneeling leg, her arms around it.

&quot;You can see the Moon,&quot; commented Makoto.

&quot;We can almost always see the Moon,&quot; said Rei,
looking back at Makoto. &quot;Don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Do you see it in her eyes?&quot; Makoto asked quietly,
reaching out to softly touch Rei&#39;s cheek. &quot;Sometimes I can
see Mars in yours. The red planet,&quot; she finished wryly.

&quot;Your eyes always seem to have stars in them to
me,&quot; Rei informed in a whisper.

&quot;Not Jupiter?&quot; Makoto chuckled.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what Jupiter looks like,&quot; Rei replied,
giving her best teasing smile. Her expression was tender
and she said, &quot;But I know what the stars do.&quot;

Reaching up to hold Makoto&#39;s hand in her own,
Rei pressed her lips into the palm, rough from work and
Senshi duty, loving the feel of its skin on hers. Lifting her
eyes to look up at Makoto, Rei smiled sweetly.

So sweetly that Makoto released a silent gasp and
felt her breath still in her chest. Everything froze in that
moment, time itself seemed to stop, and nothing in the
world existed except Rei and her smile.

It had been so long since she had really seen it.
Then again, had anyone really seen it? A smile from Rei
that was pure? Nothing but happiness and light? Not
one tainted from the stress and worries of their lives?

No, she didn&#39;t think they had.

But Makoto... she was fortunate enough to see it.
Unbelievably, she was the one that caused it to even occur
in the first place. This knowledge was almost too much for
her and she thought her heart might burst.

Then something more amazing happened. Rei
moved forward, turning around to face Makoto fully, her
lean body pressed length for length into her as her breath
that smelled as sweet as her smile, heated her skin.

Lips finally met lips and when they did, it was
everything they had ever dreamed of and more. Rei was
lost in the pricklings of desire everywhere Makoto touched
filled her body. Makoto was drowning in the heat that
filled her, making her feel more alive with every spark Rei
incited.

One kiss wasn&#39;t enough so it led to another, and
another, and another, until finally they had to stop because
they were in a public place. And neither of them exactly
wanted a park to be where they first made love.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Rei said shakily, pulling her mouth
away from the taller girl&#39;s after several minutes. She fixed
her gaze on swollen rose colored lips and realized that she
did that, her kisses had done that, and she wanted more
than anything to do it again. A trembling hand moved out
to caress those lips lightly as she spoke. &quot;I&#39;ve never...&quot;

&quot;Me either,&quot; Makoto broke in softly, her voice
reassuring as she took Rei&#39;s hand in her own and kissed
each knuckle gently. &quot;But... I want to. Do you?&quot;

Green eyes were plaintive as they met purple,
seeking nothing but the utmost honesty. This was their one
moment of truth, that would decide how things went from
here on out when it came to the both of them.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rei&#39;s words came out in a rush and they
blew over Makoto like a warm summer breeze. &quot;I want
that more than anything but I&#39;m not sure I...&quot;

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Makoto interrupted again. This time
pressing her fingertips against Rei&#39;s lips as she smiled a
gentle smile. &quot;We have all the time in the world. Just,&quot; she
stopped in her words, voice rough with emotion and eyes
alive with happiness, &quot;lets be close now.&quot;

&quot;Always,&quot; whispered Rei.

Rei then moved gracefully forward to bury herself
in the comfort of Makoto&#39;s arms, her face resting in the
crook of her shoulder. She then breathed in the bare scent
of wild flowers that always clung to Makoto.

Holding Rei close, Makoto tenderly kissed the top
of the shining tendrils of raven hair, reveling in everything
that she was feeling. Not once did she think that she would
achieve this. That she would be able to love someone fully
and totally without any fear at all about them knowing just
exactly who she really was inside.

Somehow, neither of them never thought that they
were the type meant to find romantic love. That instead it
would be best to simply be happy with the love of all their
friends, something they never thought they&#39;d have either.

Now they had both kinds of love and while in the
hold of their embrace Makoto and Rei realized something
very significant to each of them.

That, for once, it was good to be mistaken.

The characters of Kino Makoto and Hino Rei are from the
series Sailor Moon. This is longer than my usual one shots
so I guess that it&#39;s not a one shot. Ehhh... yeah, lol.
Anyway, the reason I wrote this is I realized during a
discussion with my friend Lisa that I hadn&#39;t ever read a fic
pairing these two together. And, well, I love writing new
couples! Heh, but I seriously thought it might be fun
putting these two together in what was, hopefully, a
believable and enjoyable story. It turned out a bit more
angsty than I planned but you know, what can you do? lol.
It just happened!

&quot;So who are you? I thought I knew, but I guess I was
mistaken. And all I wanted was you.&quot;
