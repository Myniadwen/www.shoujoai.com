<h1>Aishiteru, Chibi Usa</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>We&#39;re trying to make this fit with the anime, so we&#39;ve tried to work out the 
ages as well. We&#39;re guessing that ChibiUsa and Hotaru were 8 when she left 
during Sailor Stars (if anyone knows how old they really are please tell us). 
ChibiUsa then spent four years in Crystal Tokyo and came back to the past at 
the age of 12. Hotaru had reached to the apparent age of 12 during the time that 
ChibiUsa was gone. Hotaru started to age normally after that. This is a little 
over three years after Sailor Stars. ChibiUsa &amp; Hotaru are 15. Usagi and the 
Inner Senshi are 19 (They were 16 at the end of Sailor Stars). Mamoru was 
about 20 in Sailor Stars, so he is 23 now. Michiru &amp; Haruka are 20 and 
Setsuna is in her early 20&#39;s (it was never explained how old she was in the 
anime so, if anyone knows her age we would really appreciate any help). If 
there are any important characters we&#39;ve missed with their ages, please let us 
know. This story takes place about a year before our story &quot;I Love You, Hotaru&quot;. 
This is our version of Hotaru and ChibiUsa falling in love (that&#39;s not entirely 
true. They&#39;ve been best friends and very close for a long time, so they fell in 
love over the years. This story is about them realizing their feelings for each 
other). This story was inspired by the story &quot;ChibiUsa No Pyua Na Kokoro&quot; 
by Andrea Doolan. It&#39;s a beautiful romance story about ChibiUsa &amp; Hotaru. 

Sorry for such a long authors&#39; note. We just felt like we had a lot to say
this time around. Thanks. ^_^

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hotaru stood outside of the house she shared with the three other 
outer senshi waiting for ChibiUsa to show up. 
	&quot;Aren&#39;t you a little too old to have a sleep over?&quot; asked Haruka as
she leaned against the side of the house.
	&quot;Oh, leave her alone, Haruka. They&#39;ve been sleeping over at each 
other&#39;s houses since they were little kids. I think its cute that they still
do things like that,&quot; said Michiru as she stepped outside. 
	&quot;I know, Michiru. I just like to give her a hard time about her little
girlfriend,&quot; said Haruka. She put her arms around Michiru and the two kissed.
	&quot;She&#39;s not my girlfriend,&quot; said Hotaru. &quot;We&#39;re just best friends.&quot; 
&#39;Just because they&#39;re gay doesn&#39;t mean I am. Even though ChibiUsa&#39;s nice,
my best friend, cheerful, cute, sexy, I love spending time with her......What
was I thinking?!&#39; Hotaru shook her head to clear that line of thought. 
&#39;ChibiUsa&#39;s just my best friend.&#39;
	Finally, Michiru and Haruka broke the kiss. &quot;Are you two ready?&quot; asked
Setsuna, standing in the doorway. 
	&quot;Ready for what?&quot; replied Haruka.
	&quot;Michiru and I were going to go see a movie. ChibiUsa and Hotaru are 
old enough to watch themselves. Do you want to go?&quot; asked Setsuna.
	&quot;Sure,&quot; said Haruka, slightly disappointed. She had wanted to take
Michiru out to a nice romantic dinner. 
	&quot;Okay, good. Wait here, I&#39;ve got to go get my jacket,&quot; said Michiru.
She kissed Haruka and then walked back inside with Setsuna.
	&quot;You&#39;ll be okay with us gone, right?&quot; asked Haruka.
	&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m 15 years old,&quot; said Hotaru.
	Haruka smiled at the younger girl. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll be fine. We shouldn&#39;t
be gone too long anyway.&quot;
	&quot;Oh, good. It&#39;s ChibiUsa.&quot; Hotaru said as she started to wave to the
pink haired girl walking towards the house. &quot;Hi, ChibiUsa!&quot;
	&quot;She&#39;s cute, isn&#39;t she?&quot; asked Haruka.
	&quot;Yeah, she is,&quot; said Hotaru. Hotaru blushed a deep crimson when she
realized what she had said. &quot;I mean cute in a friendly way,&quot; she said 
nervously.
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t tell anybody how you feel about her,&quot; Haruka 
said just as Michiru and Setsuna came out of the house. They waved to Hotaru 
as they walked towards the car. Hotaru wondered to herself how she felt about
ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Hi, Hotaru. Where are they going?&quot; asked ChibiUsa as she walked up
to her best friend and hugged her.
	&quot;Hi ChibiUsa. They&#39;re going to a movie. Let&#39;s go upstairs. You can 
leave your stuff there and then we can decide what to do,&quot; said Hotaru. They
walked inside. Hotaru grabbed ChibiUsa&#39;s hand and the two girls ran upstairs.
	ChibiUsa had always liked Hotaru&#39;s room. It felt so.... romantic. She
couldn&#39;t really explain it any other way. It was fairly dark even with all of
the lamps Hotaru had collected. ChibiUsa set her backpack on the bed and 
followed Hotaru back downstairs. 
	They talked for hours, enjoying each other&#39;s company. They didn&#39;t 
even notice the sky outside darkening as it got later. Both girls heard a 
small rumbling sound. ChibiUsa blushed. It had been her stomach.
	Hotaru laughed. &quot;Your hungry, aren&#39;t you, ChibiUsa? I hadn&#39;t noticed 
how late it was getting. Michiru-mama, Setsuna-mama, and Haruka-papa will 
probably be back soon, but we might as well get our own dinner.&quot; 
	&quot;That sounds good. I skipped lunch today since Usagi was cooking,&quot; 
said ChibiUsa as she followed Hotaru into the kitchen. They looked around to 
find something to eat. They couldn&#39;t find anything that looked appetizing.
	&quot;There&#39;s nothing to eat...&quot; said ChibiUsa as she closed the 
refrigerator.
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll cook,&quot; ChibiUsa looked at Hotaru skeptically. &quot;It&#39;s
okay. Setsuna-mama taught me how to cook a few things. It shouldn&#39;t take too
long,&quot; finished Hotaru. She told ChibiUsa what she needed and the two girls 
started looking for the ingredients.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;That looks great. Thanks, Hotaru. I was starving,&quot; said ChibiUsa as 
she looked in the oven.
	Hotaru smiled at ChibiUsa. &quot;I hope you like it,&quot; she said as she tried
to find glasses for the two of them.
	&quot;I think it&#39;s done,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She opened the oven and reached 
in. ChibiUsa yelled and pulled back her hand. 
	&quot;ChibiUsa!&quot; Hotaru rushed over to her friend. ChibiUsa had tears in
her eyes as she held her hand. Hotaru gently held onto ChibiUsa&#39;s hand. She
had burned herself when she had tried to get their dinner out of the oven. 
Hotaru concentrated as she held ChibiUsa&#39;s hand. The burn started to fade. 
&quot;How&#39;s that, ChibiUsa?&quot;
	&quot;It still hurts,&quot; said ChibiUsa as she tried to flex her hand.
	&quot;Wait right here,&quot; Hotaru ran off. She came back with a first aid kit.
She grabbed ChibiUsa&#39;s hand again and started to bandage it. &quot;Done,&quot; said 
Hotaru. She looked at ChibiUsa. &quot;You scared me. I hate to see you hurt.&quot; 
	ChibiUsa blinked away the tears of pain. She and Hotaru looked into 
each others eyes. Both girls started to lean closer to each other. Just as
they were about to kiss, they heard a door close. They pulled away, neither
quite sure about what had been about to happen.
	&quot;We&#39;re home,&quot; Setsuna shouted as they walked in the front door. &quot;You 
two have fun  while we were gone?&quot; she asked.
	&quot;Yeah, we did,&quot; said Hotaru. &quot;How was the movie?&quot;
	&quot;It was great,&quot; said Michiru. &quot;It was very romantic.&quot;
	&quot;Next time we&#39;ll go watch an action movie. Then I won&#39;t have to be
reminded of how alone we all are, or in my case, how alone I am. That and the
sweet couple here,&quot; she said, indicating Haruka and Michiru, &quot;kissing the 
whole time just helped me realize that it&#39;s been a thousand odd years and I 
still don&#39;t have anyone. On that note, I&#39;m going to bed. Good night.&quot; 
Setsuna walked off towards her room. The other girls sweat-dropped. 
	&quot;I hope she&#39;s doing okay,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Yeah. That was kind of scary,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;It&#39;s late. Maybe you two should go to bed,&quot; said Michiru.
	Hotaru yawned. &quot;Yeah, it is getting late. Come on, ChibiUsa.&quot;
	&quot;Good night,&quot; said Haruka.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Both girls washed up and got ready for bed. ChibiUsa was rummaging 
through her backpack for her night shirt. She glanced to her left and saw
Hotaru&#39;s clothes on the floor. She looked up and saw Hotaru pulling on her
nightie. Her gaze slowly went higher as she looked at her best friend&#39;s nude
body. The moonlight from the open window splashed across Hotaru&#39;s body. She
tried to avert her gaze but she was entranced. Hotaru was beautiful. ChibiUsa
and Hotaru had changed in front of each other before. Why was this so
different? 
	&quot;ChibiUsa, are you okay?&quot; asked Hotaru.
	&quot;I...I&#39;m fine,&quot; said ChibiUsa as she looked away, blushing. She found
her night shirt and walked to another room to change. She started to unbutton
her blouse when she heard something behind her. She turned around to see that 
Hotaru had followed her. She was looking at ChibiUsa questioningly.
	&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Hotaru. She was wondering why ChibiUsa 
had walked off.
	&quot;I&#39;m just changing,&quot; said ChibiUsa defensively. She didn&#39;t really 
have a reason why she had gone to change in another room. She never had 
before. She decided to change quickly. If she kept trying to get Hotaru out,
she might get suspicious. &#39;Suspicious of what?&#39; thought ChibiUsa. She pulled 
the half unbuttoned blouse over her head. The shirt got caught when it was 
around her head. Hotaru giggled lightly as she walked over to help her friend.
	ChibiUsa turned to face her when she heard her footsteps. &quot;I&#39;m stuck,&quot;
she said simply.
	Hotaru stifled another giggle. &quot;Here, let me help you. It&#39;s caught on
one of your odango.&quot; She brought her hands up and started to unbutton the 
shirt the rest of the way. She smiled as ChibiUsa&#39;s face came into view. 
ChibiUsa looked emberassed for needing Hotaru to help take her shirt off. 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, ChibiUsa. When you have an intricate hair style like your 
odango, something like that&#39;s bound to happen sooner or later. You should 
let your hair down before you go to sleep, anyway.&quot;
	&quot;Do you think so?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Hotaru. Since she was only slightly taller than 
ChibiUsa, she stood on her on the tips of her toes and started to undo her 
odango. She could smell the scent of her hair. After some of the things that 
had happened that day, just breathing in the scent of ChibiUsa&#39;s hair calmed
her. Finally she finished and took a step away. &quot;There, done,&quot; she said. 
	ChibiUsa looked into a mirror on the wall. Her pink hair cascaded 
lightly down. It reached just below her bare shoulders. She saw Hotaru behind 
her in the mirror.
	&quot;How do I look?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Gorgeous,&quot; Hotaru murmured more to herself than to ChibiUsa. &quot;You 
look great.&quot;
	&quot;Thanks, Hotaru,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She looked at Hotaru and followed 
her gaze downward. She saw that she was only wearing her bra and her skirt.
Both girls blushed immensely. ChibiUsa pulled her skirt off and grabbed the 
night shirt, dressing as quickly as possible. ChibiUsa turned around when she
was done, but Hotaru was already gone. She picked up her clothes and walked 
back to Hotaru&#39;s room. Hotaru was on her bed reading. She put her clothes in 
the backpack. 
	&quot;What are you reading?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Some poetry. It&#39;s interesting,&quot; answered Hotaru. She lifted up the
blanket. &quot;You should get in. It&#39;s getting pretty cold tonight.&quot; ChibiUsa 
climbed under the blankets. 
	&quot;Do you still like Helios?&quot; Hotaru asked.
	&quot;Where&#39;d that come from?&quot; replied ChibiUsa.
	&quot;I was just wondering,&quot; said Hotaru. &quot;It has been seven years since 
you&#39;ve seen him.&quot;
	ChibiUsa thought for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Back then I knew I had
to protect him. I don&#39;t really know if there was anything between us in the 
first place. And by now he&#39;s probably forgotten about me, so I shouldn&#39;t 
worry about it.&quot;
	&quot;How could he forget about you? You&#39;re beautiful, charming, sweet...&quot;
Hotaru&#39;s voice trailed off.
	&quot;Thanks, but I&#39;m sure Helios didn&#39;t think of me like that,&quot; said 
ChibiUsa.
	&quot;If he didn&#39;t see you like that, then he must not have known you very 
well,&quot; replied Hotaru. 
	&quot;ChibiUsa? Are you awake?&quot; asked Hotaru some time later. She turned 
over and looked at ChibiUsa. Hotaru smiled lightly. ChibiUsa had fallen asleep
while they had been talking. Hotaru pulled the blanket up higher on ChibiUsa.
Hotaru fell asleep several minutes later.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Sunlight filtered in through the window onto the two sleeping girls.
ChibiUsa rolled over onto Hotaru. Hotaru&#39;s arms encircled ChibiUsa&#39;s waist.
ChibiUsa slowly opened her eyes when she felt the arms around her. Her vision
started to clear as she looked at Hotaru. She panicked and tried to pull 
away. Both girls tumbled off of the bed. 
	&quot;Owww...&quot; Hotaru opened her eyes when she hit the floor. Her arms were
pinned at the small of ChibiUsa&#39;s back. Their faces were mere inches apart. 
Their legs were intertwined beneath the blankets, with one of Hotaru&#39;s legs 
between ChibiUsa&#39;s. ChibiUsa&#39;s hands were pressed up against Hotaru&#39;s breasts.
Her hands were caught between both of their bodies. Hotaru&#39;s nipples brushed 
ChibiUsa&#39;s palms through the thin fabric of her nightie. Both girls looked 
deep into each other&#39;s eyes. Something was partially obscuring Hotaru&#39;s 
vision. ChibiUsa pushed Hotaru up slightly with one hand and brought her 
other hand to Hotaru&#39;s forehead. Both girls blushed furiously and got into 
sitting positions. 
	&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Hotaru nervously.
	&quot;It&#39;s a Post-It note,&quot; said ChibiUsa, feigning a great amount of 
interest in the piece of paper. ChibiUsa gave Hotaru the note.
	&quot;It says, &#39;Hi, Hotaru! You and ChibiUsa are home alone with an 
axe-murderer.&#39;&quot; Both girls looked at each other for a moment. &quot;&#39;Just kidding.
Michiru, Haruka, and I went shopping. We&#39;ll be back around noon. Have fun, 
you two. Love, Setsuna&#39;. That&#39;s strange. I guess we&#39;ll see them later,&quot; said
Hotaru. 
	Both girls sat in silence for several minutes. At the very least, 
they had had a very embarrassing way to wake up. At the most, it was far more
significant. 
	&quot;ChibiUsa, would you like some breakfast?&quot; asked Hotaru, breaking the
tense moment.
	ChibiUsa smiled at her best friend &#39;And nothing more,&#39; she thought
to herself. &quot;That would be great.&quot; Both girls walked downstairs. Hotaru found
some food Setsuna had left for them. The both sat down at the table, still a 
bit uneasy after what had happened that morning. They ate in relative 
silence, trying to keep up a small conversation. When they finished eating,
ChibiUsa and Hotaru cleaned up the food and dishes. 
	&quot;I&#39;m going to change my clothes. I&#39;ll be back in a minute,&quot; said 
ChibiUsa. She walked back to Hotaru&#39;s room. She slumped down on the floor 
near the foot of Hotaru&#39;s bed. &quot;What am I going to do? Hotaru&#39;s my best 
friend. I can&#39;t be in love with her. I can&#39;t,&quot; she said, not knowing she had 
spoken out loud. Hotaru stood in the doorway, stunned by what she had heard. 
	&quot;Aishiteru, ChibiUsa,&quot; said Hotaru as she walked into the room. 
	&quot;Hotaru?&quot; ChibiUsa looked at Hotaru. Hotaru sat by ChibiUsa. She 
gently laid her hand upon ChibiUsa&#39;s.
	&quot;ChibiUsa, you&#39;ve been there for me when no one else was. You were
there for me whenever I needed you. You cared when no one else did. We&#39;ve 
been friends for a long time now, but during that time I couldn&#39;t help but fall
in love with you,&quot; Hotaru&#39;s voice was heavy with emotion. Tears were running 
down her face. 
	&quot;Hotaru,&quot; ChibiUsa grabbed the other girl and pulled her into an 
embrace. &quot;I hadn&#39;t realized how important you were to me before today. I 
remember the hardest part of going back to the future was that I thought I&#39;d
never see you again. I couldn&#39;t wait to see you when I came back to the
past. I fell in love with you during all this time, too. I love you, Hotaru.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s strange. We&#39;re both girls, but its like fate we met,&quot; said
Hotaru between sobs as she held onto ChibiUsa. ChibiUsa brought her hand to
Hotaru&#39;s chin and lifted her head up. Hotaru saw that ChibiUsa had tears in 
her eyes as well. Both girls leaned toward each other. Their lips brushed 
together lightly at first. They kissed passionately as they let go of all of
the pent up emotions they had had over each other. ChibiUsa ran a hand 
through Hotaru&#39;s hair. Hotaru placed her hand on the side of ChibiUsa&#39;s 
face and gently started to caress her cheek. They finally broke the kiss after
what seemed like hours. ChibiUsa&#39;s cheeks had a rosey blush to them. 
	&quot;ChibiUsa, don&#39;t be embarrassed. There&#39;s nothing wrong with this. We&#39;re
in love. That&#39;s all that matters,&quot; Hotaru said, realizing how right those
words sounded. All that really mattered to her was ChibiUsa. 
	&quot;I know, Hotaru. It&#39;s just weird finding out that you&#39;re in love with
your best friend,&quot; said ChibiUsa. 
	&quot;I&#39;m going through the same thing. Don&#39;t worry. Just think about it
this way. We won&#39;t have to go through that awkward part of the relationship
where you have to find out everything about the person,&quot; said Hotaru.
	ChibiUsa laughed. Hotaru smiled. She loved to hear the pink haired 
girl laugh. They both sat on the edge of the bed. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going
to happen, but it doesn&#39;t matter as long as I&#39;m with you,&quot; said Hotaru as she
rested a hand on ChibiUsa&#39;s thigh. 
	ChibiUsa brushed some strands of hair away from Hotaru&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;ll
be with you forever, Hotaru,&quot; said ChibiUsa. 
	The two girls leaned into another kiss. Hotaru started to caress 
ChibiUsa&#39;s inner thigh. Hotaru gently pushed ChibiUsa back onto the bed. 
ChibiUsa cupped Hotaru&#39;s breasts through the thin fabric of her nightie. 
Hotaru&#39;s hand traveled farther up ChibiUsa&#39;s bare leg. ChibiUsa felt Hotaru&#39;s
body atop her own. She pulled Hotaru&#39;s nightie slowly down past her waist. 
Hotaru slid the nightie the rest of the way off, past her supple legs and 
onto the floor. ChibiUsa blushed. She was looking at Hotaru&#39;s body in a way 
she never had before. Before she had always thought of her as a friend. Now 
she thought of her as the most beautiful girl she had ever seen. ChibiUsa 
felt the heat between her legs rising as she felt Hotaru&#39;s naked form against 
her own lightly clothed body. They kissed as their bodies pressed together. 
ChibiUsa brought her hands up to the bare skin of Hotaru&#39;s breasts. Hotaru&#39;s
nipples were pressed against ChibiUsa&#39;s palms. Hotaru reached under the bottom
of ChibiUsa&#39;s night shirt. She pulled ChibiUsa&#39;s panties down and off. The 
panties fell on the floor next to Hotaru&#39;s nightie. Hotaru&#39;s hand slid back
under the night shirt. She felt ChibiUsa&#39;s soft curves against her hand. She
felt the rising swell of ChibiUsa&#39;s breasts as her hand went higher. With her
other hand, she brushed gently across ChibiUsa&#39;s pussy, causing the pink 
haired girl to shudder slightly from the new sensation. Hotaru brought both
hands up and pulled ChibiUsa&#39;s night shirt off. Since ChibiUsa&#39;s hair was 
still down, it was easy to pull off. Both girls looked up and down the others
body. ChibiUsa&#39;s cheeks were flushed from the sensation of Hotaru&#39;s naked 
body atop her own. Hotaru&#39;s hand tickled ChibiUsa&#39;s inner thigh. One of 
ChibiUsa&#39;s hands fondled one of Hotaru&#39;s breasts while her other hand ran up
and down Hotaru&#39;s back. Hotaru&#39;s hand brushed against ChibiUsa&#39;s pussy again.
This time her fingers lingered there. She started to rub ChibiUsa&#39;s inner
lips. She could smell ChibiUsa&#39;s musky scent as she slid a finger into 
ChibiUsa&#39;s pussy. ChibiUsa pinched one of Hotaru&#39;s nipples. Hotaru rubbed her
thumb over ChibiUsa&#39;s clit. ChibiUsa moaned as she felt Hotaru slide another 
finger into her pussy. ChibiUsa&#39;s love juices started running down her
upper thighs and onto the bed. ChibiUsa felt Hotaru push her fingers deeper
inside her. Hotaru continued to stroke ChibiUsa&#39;s clit. ChibiUsa started
to move her hips along with Hotaru&#39;s fingers. 
	&quot;Ohhhh...Hota..Hotaru...&quot; ChibiUsa moaned Hotaru&#39;s name. ChibiUsa
reached orgasm as she felt Hotaru kissing along her neck and shoulder. 
	Hotaru felt ChibiUsa&#39;s muscles tense as she orgasmed. Hotaru brought 
her hand to her mouth and licked away ChibiUsa&#39;s cum. 
	ChibiUsa kissed Hotaru. &quot;Oh, thank you, Hotaru. That felt so good.&quot;
	Hotaru brought a hand up to the side of ChibiUsa&#39;s face and smiled.
&quot;I love you, ChibiUsa. That was just one way of showing it.&quot; Both girls 
kissed again. 
	ChibiUsa rolled over so that she was on top of Hotaru. ChibiUsa 
kissed Hotaru&#39;s shoulder and traveled down to one of her breasts. ChibiUsa 
licked the top of Hotaru&#39;s breast. She brought her mouth farther down to 
Hotaru&#39;s pebble-like nipple. She ran her tongue across the nipple and then 
started to suck on it. ChibiUsa brought her head to Hotaru&#39;s other breast and
repeated sucking on her nipple. Hotaru moaned as she felt ChibiUsa start 
moving downward. She ran her hands through ChibiUsa&#39;s hair, feeling the 
strands between her fingers. ChibiUsa ran her tongue across Hotaru&#39;s stomach,
stopping at her belly button for several seconds before moving on. ChibiUsa
could smell Hotaru&#39;s arousal as her face paused just above Hotaru&#39;s slit.
ChibiUsa gently licked Hotaru&#39;s sheath. ChibiUsa brought her hand up and 
used two fingers to hold her pussy open, so she could gain further access to
Hotaru. ChibiUsa licked Hotaru&#39;s inner lips. Hotaru panted as she continued 
to run her hands through ChibiUsa&#39;s hair. ChibiUsa&#39;s tongue went deeper into 
Hotaru, emitting a moan from the other girl. ChibiUsa went further up and
licked Hotaru&#39;s clit. She brought her mouth to Hotaru&#39;s clit and started to 
suck on her pearl. She brought her hand up across Hotaru&#39;s leg and started
caressing her inner thigh. Hotaru felt ChibiUsa&#39;s tongue wash over her clit.
ChibiUsa&#39;s hand went farther up from Hotaru&#39;s thigh to her sheath. ChibiUsa
pushed a finger up to the first knuckle into Hotaru. Hotaru reached orgasm 
as she felt ChibiUsa add another finger. ChibiUsa got up and crawled back by
Hotaru. Hotaru put her arms around ChibiUsa as they laid in the bed. They 
kissed once more as they lay, looking into each others eyes.
	&quot;I love you, ChibiUsa,&quot; said Hotaru as she looked at the other girls 
lovely face.
	ChibiUsa sighed contentedly. &quot;I love you, too, Hotaru,&quot; replied 
ChibiUsa as she looked into Hotaru&#39;s purple eyes. 
	&quot;We better go take a shower, before everyone gets home,&quot; said 
Hotaru.
	&quot;What time is it now?&quot; asked ChibiUsa worriedly.
	&quot;It&#39;s almost ten. They said they&#39;d be home by noon, so we have plenty
of time to take a long, relaxing shower,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;Whatever could you mean?&quot; asked ChibiUsa, feigning innocence. Both 
girls giggled. 
	&quot;You start the water. I&#39;ll take care of the sheets and our clothes,&quot;
said Hotaru. 
	&quot;Okay, that sounds good,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She kissed Hotaru lightly
on the lips before walking toward the bathroom. Hotaru changed her sheets and
packed ChibiUsa&#39;s clothes in her backpack. By the time she got to the 
bathroom, ChibiUsa was already in the shower. Hotaru came up behind ChibiUsa
and put her arms around her waist. ChibiUsa was a bit startled, but relaxed 
into the embrace. 
	&quot;How did I never notice how beautiful you are?&quot; asked ChibiUsa as 
Hotaru stepped under the shower head.
	Hotaru smiled. &quot;Thanks, ChibiUsa. I&#39;ve had strong feelings for you
for a long time now. I just never expressed it as love. I always thought of
it as friendship. I thought you were cute since the first time we met.&quot;
	&quot;When we met, you were twelve and I was eight,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;You were a very cute little girl, then,&quot; said Hotaru. She got a 
wistful look in her eyes. &quot;What a romantic way to meet. I managed to catch 
your hat before it flew away and you saved me from a daemon. Too bad it took
years for anything to happen.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, but we were really young back then. It had to take years for
us both to grow up,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;I know,&quot; said Hotaru. &quot;I just wonder why it took us both so long to 
realize anything. We&#39;ve been best friends for over three years.&quot;
	&quot;Actually, I was wondering about that,&quot; said ChibiUsa. &quot;From some of 
the things you said a while ago I was wondering how you felt about me. I&#39;d 
only think about it for a couple seconds before getting rid of the idea, but
now it makes more since.&quot;
	Hotaru looked puzzled. &quot;What did I say?&quot; 
	ChibiUsa blushed. &quot;Well, one time you and I were walking to school
and Usagi showed up. We were holding hands at the time and she said she 
thought that we were getting a little to friendly. You replied by saying that
it&#39;s okay to hold hands and didn&#39;t she and Mamoru hold hands.&quot;
	&quot;Ohhh, yeah, that.&quot; Hotaru smiled at ChibiUsa. &quot;I guess I always knew
I loved you, if only on a subconscious level.&quot;
	&quot;And the time you were calling my friends Ruruna and Naruru bimbos
when they said I was their best friend,&quot; continued ChibiUsa.
	&quot;I got really attached to you. You were my first and best friend. And
they were bimbos,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;And the time you and I danced together at Usagi and Mamoru&#39;s 
wedding,&quot; ChibiUsa smiled at the memory.
	&quot;Well, at the time, I thought it was just because there weren&#39;t many 
boys there and none of them had asked us, but looking back on it, I did want
to dance with you that day,&quot; replied Hotaru.
	ChibiUsa hugged her. &quot;Oh, good. I liked dancing with you, too, 
Hotaru.&quot;
They lathered each other up and washed off together. Hotaru grabbed a towel 
when they got out of the shower and started to dry ChibiUsa off. ChibiUsa 
dried Hotaru when she was finished. The girls walked out of the bathroom 
holding hands. They went back to Hotaru&#39;s room and helped each other get 
dressed. They sat on the bed in silence for a while.
	&quot;I&#39;m kind of worried,&quot; ChibiUsa said suddenly.
	&quot;What about?&quot; asked Hotaru.
	&quot;Just different things. First, how are we going to tell everyone. I
want to tell my mom and dad, but I don&#39;t really think about Usagi and Mamoru
as my parents yet. Another is that I&#39;m from the future. I haven&#39;t even been
born yet. And last, I&#39;m the princess of Crystal Tokyo. After I take over, I
have to have an heir,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	Hotaru held ChibiUsa in her arms. &quot;Whatever happens, we&#39;ll be 
together. I love you. You&#39;re all that matters to me. Things will work out. 
And I&#39;ll be there with you no matter what happens.&quot;
	Both girls leaned into a passionate kiss, holding each other and
wishing the moment would never end.

Well, we hope you all enjoy this story. Sorry it took so long to get out, but
our personal lives interfered a lot. We hope to get back to writing more this
week. We&#39;re gonna try to address some of ChibiUsa and Hotaru&#39;s problems (What
ChibiUsa was talking about at the end) in later stories. If you have any 
ideas for ChibiUsa and Hotaru, please write us.
