It took them two hours through the dense forest, cutting through the 
marsh more than often, to finally reach the small village that Juuban 
Town was. In truth, they got lost, you see... Sense of direction wasn&#146;t 
one of Donkey Pelt strong points.

&#145;Does she have any?&#146; A little voice in Michiru&#146;s head perfidly asked. 
She guiltily battered down the voice. It wasn&#146;t like her to be that 
cynical. After all, the girl didn&#146;t deserve it. Yes, she was a bit... 
Err, incredibly clumsy and, hum, rather oblivious, but she had sincerely 
tried her best. Not that it was really helpful, but she had also been 
genuinely interested in Michiru&#146;s life. She had even asked her to play 
the violin, a request that the young ogress was more than happy to 
grant. It was the first time that someone really wanted to listen to 
her, after all, she couldn&#146;t let the chance pass. Even if she played for 
only one person, in the middle of the woods, covered in mud and 
unidentified plants. And the girl had actually shed a tear upon hearing 
the sad piece Michiru had chosen. The ogress didn&#146;t know why, but she 
felt flattered. She couldn&#146;t recall the last time anyone had taken 
interest in her. She couldn&#146;t recall the last time someone had tried so 
hard to befriend her.

That girl, Michiru decided, hid a diamond under this pelt. The ogress 
wondered why she always wore this horrendous thing. Curiosity stung her. 
What did Donkey Pelt really look like? What was her real name? What was 
her story? Michiru had tried to get answers to these questions, but 
Donkey Pelt had cleverly diverted her by asking again about Setsuna&#146;s 
last words.

Setsuna&#146;s words. The main thing that had preoccupied her thoughts since 
she had taken on this quest. &#145;My heart&#146;s desire?&#146; Well she wanted a lot 
of things. The most urgent one at the moment being a bath...

&#147;AAHHH!!! MONSTERS! MONSTERS ARE ATTACKING THE VILLAGE!!!&#148;

The high-pitched scream wrenched her out of her thoughts. She and Donkey 
Pelt frantically looked around them, trying locating the new threat. 
That&#146;s when she saw the mob of villagers with sharp scythes and nasty 
pitchforks heading towards her and the servant that she understood who 
the monsters were. She back-pedalled hurriedly, dragging Donkey Pelt 
with her.

&#147;NO!!! We aren&#146;t monsters!!! We are on a quest for Prince Endymion!!!&#148; 
With her free hand, she reached in the cleavage of what was left of her 
dress and produced the cardinal&#146;s envelope. It was dripping pitifully. 
Nevertheless, she threw it at the mob.

The mob backed away in perfect synchronisation, staring at the wet 
envelope lying in the grass as if it was going to blow up. One of the 
peasants even poked it with his pitchfork to verify it wasn&#146;t alive... 
They whispered among themselves, occasionally glancing nervously at the 
two women. Finally, they seemed to come to a consensus.

&#147;We haffta get Thinker!&#148; She could hear them say. &#147;Yeah, Thinker can 
read &#145;nd all... And it ain&#146;t like she&#146;ll be a loss for da village if 
they eat her...&#148; &#147;Yeah, we dun need a useless doctor! We&#146;re all healthy 
as horses.&#148; &#147;And her fees&#146;re too high!&#148; &#147;But she ain&#146;t asked to be 
paid...&#148; &#147;That&#146;s what I said! That ain&#146;t normal!!!&#148; &#147;Yeah!!!&#148; &#147;Yeah!&#148; 
&#147;Yeah!&#148; &#147;Yeahh!!!&#148; They finally claimed in unison.

A peasant was quickly selected to go fetch the person called Thinker. He 
came back two minutes later, a rather petite, well dwarfish was more 
accurate, woman, tagging along, a curious look painted on her gentle 
face. She had deep intelligent blue eyes and short dark blue hair. She 
wore a plain white dress with plenty of pockets, writing feathers stuck 
in them, and carried a black handbag. She looked at the ogress and her 
companion with an amused glint dancing in her eyes. She neared the 
envelope, kneeled and carefully picked it up as the mob backed further 
away, not so far as they&#146;d miss the show, though.

She opened her bag, took a small, very sharp-looking knife and opened it 
without breaking the seal. She opened the letter, read it silently and 
carefully folded it back. Then she turned to the expectant villagers. 
&#147;They are not lying. They have really been sent on a quest by the Prince 
himself.&#148; She said quietly.

&#147;But what if these monsters had killed the real hero and taken the 
letter?&#148; A peasant asked dubiously.

Thinker smiled confidently. &#147;That was a very intelligent question and I 
am glad that you pointed it out.&#148; She saw him literally inflate with 
pride. &#147;However, as you can see, this envelope has been sealed with the 
Cardinal&#146;s personal holy seal, which means that it has been blessed by 
the church and God Himself. Thus, no SINNER, much less monster, would be 
able to touch it without being immediately burned to ashes and their 
soul sent to hell to suffer an eternity of torments.&#148; She handed the 
letter to them. &#147;Does anyone want to have a look?&#148;

It was amazing to see how perfectly healthy people could suddenly look 
so ill. &#147;NO!!! Err... No, we trust you completely, Thinker. Now, err... 
Oh! The sun&#146;s setting already! So late! Gotta go, by!!!&#148; and they 
dispersed hurriedly.

-----------------------------------------------------

In a dark little street, not far from the trio, a blue-eyed shadow was 
cursing their luck. Plan A was in the drains. It was time for plan B, 
then...

-----------------------------------------------------

Left alone, Thinker turned to the two newcomers and walked to them. She 
extended her hand. &#147;Good evening, travellers. My name is Ami, the town&#146;s 
doctor, but everybody here calls me Thinker.&#148; She looked them over as 
each one alternatively took her hand and shook it. &#147;And I believe you 
are looking for an accommodation for the night?&#148;

Donkey Pelt bounced enthusiastically. &#147;Oh wow! You&#146;re so clever! How did 
you guess?&#148;

Michiru and Ami sweat dropped.

&#147;Err... Indeed. She&#146;s called Donkey Pelt and my name&#146;s Michiru. Thank 
you for helping us out!&#148; Ami smiled in return, a slight blush colouring 
her cheeks. Yep, Michiru really liked the blue-haired doctor, she 
decided. &#147;We heard about a famous inn in this town and thought we would 
spend the night. It&#146;s called the &#145;Snow White Inn&#146;, I believe...&#148;

At this, a smile like no other blossomed on the young dwarf&#146;s face. &#147;Oh! 
Mako&#146;s tavern! Of course, it&#146;s the best in the whole kingdom. I was 
going there myself, I&#146;ll show you the way...&#148; The blush on her pretty 
face considerably deepened at mentioning the inn&#146;s owner name. Michiru 
had to smile to herself. Of course a pretty little thing like her would 
be taken...

It was a short walk, really. And Michiru wasn&#146;t disappointed. It was 
huge, considering the size of the village, there was large stables in 
the backyard. Indoor, it was brightly lighted, and spotless! The ground 
floor was obviously a bar-restaurant, already packed with patrons of all 
origins, waiting for the evening meal, which was absolutely delicious, 
if the smell coming from the kitchen behind the bar was any indication. 
Michiru noticed a stage in the far end of the room, but nobody was 
currently performing. A staircase on her right led to the bedrooms, 
upstairs. The inn was probably a coach stop.

Ami disappeared directly in the kitchen and came back minutes later, 
pulling on the hand of the tallest woman Michiru had ever met. She knew 
she wasn&#146;t the tallest of ogresses by far, but still! This woman was 
really impressive! She blinked several times, her gaze jumping from the 
giant to the dwarf and back again. And for once, Donkey Pelt was 
speechless as well. Imagination was launched into stratosphere for both 
of them.

&#147;You better not make any tasteless joke!&#148; The giant warned in thunderous 
tone.

Michiru suddenly realised that she was staring. &#147;Oh my! I apologize for 
my unforgivable behaviour. I didn&#146;t intend to be so rude!&#148; She nudged 
the still awe-struck Donkey Pelt, who snapped out of her private fantasy 
and followed the ogress&#146;s example. Err, actually she literally jumped to 
the tall woman&#146;s feet, mumbling incoherently about being deeply sorry, 
delicious smell, plush beds...

Ami smiled reassuringly while helping the prostrated girl up. &#147;Please, 
don&#146;t be embarrassed, we get that look all the time...&#148;

&#147;It is still not an excuse for my unacceptable behaviour, but I thank 
you for your understanding and forgiveness.&#148; Michiru replied firmly, 
which earned her a smile from the Snow White&#146;s owner.

&#147;Yeah, you can thank her, personally I&#146;d have flattened you.&#148; Her smile 
widened when the two women paled down, swallowing nervously.

The petite doctor swatted her arm. &#147;Ow! Okay, okay! I&#146;ll be nice now.&#148; 
She turned to her two new guests. &#147;So, Ami tells me that you&#146;ll be 
spending the night?&#148;</pre>
