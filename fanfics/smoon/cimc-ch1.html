<h1>Come into My Chamber (part 1 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Come into my chamber,&quot; said the Spider to the Fly..
 
She could hear it...tearing through the forest...after her...
 
Clad in only her nightgown, she ran as fast as she could, the branches 
of the trees snagging on the silky, thin garment. She whimpered, pulled 
away. She had to run, it was after her...she was going to die...run, run 
faster..
 
But oh, the creature was far faster than the tiny girl, and it watched 
as she feverishly weaved through the trees, trying so hard to run...it 
almost broke the beast&#146;s heart..
 
But it could save her...she would resent it...for centuries to come, but 
it had to..it  had to..
 
Taint her...
 
And as quick as lightning...it was upon her, sinking its teeth into the 
skin on her beautiful neck...and like music, the blood sung in its 
veins...her blood...their blood...
 
Tainted...forever...the two of them...for all eternity..

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;Hino! Are you asleep again?!&quot; Rei Hino&#146;s eyes slowly opened, and she 
gazed in disdain at the man looming over her desk. She brushed stray 
strands of silky black hair from her face and sighed. &quot;Hey Mamoru. And 
it&#146;s Detective Hino, for your information. I earned that title.&quot; She was 
quite pleased when she saw the man&#146;s sapphire eyes darken. &quot;And it&#146;s 
Captain Chiba, for YOUR information, miss. Anyway, as much as I hate 
coming into this impossibly clean office of yours,&quot; Rei scoffed, and 
Mamoru ignored her, &quot;I don&#146;t understand how you can be so 
organized...anyway, I&#146;ve got a case for you.&quot; Rei&#146;s violet eye&#146;s lit up, 
and she grinned brightly. &quot;Really?&quot; Mamoru rolled his eyes. 
&quot;Yeah...there&#146;s some real freaky shit happening...we&#146;ve found some 
bodies...the blood is all sucked out of them.&quot; Rei shook her head. 
&quot;Vampires? Yeah, okay Captain...&quot; Mamoru laughed. &quot;That&#146;s what some of the 
guys are saying...&quot; Rei scoffed. &quot;Rookies...probably some weirdo...&quot; Mamoru 
sighed. &quot;Maybe...maybe not...&quot;  Rei rolled her eyes, and looked at the 
ceiling. &quot;You have gotta be kidding me...Captain, you don&#146;t think it&#146;s 
vamps, do you?&quot; Mamoru rubbed the back of his head, looking perplexed. 
&quot;Well...hmm...the victims...have these tiny marks on the side of their 
necks...weird, ne?&quot; Rei&#146;s eyes widened slightly. &quot;That IS weird...&quot; Mamoru 
sighed, and handed her a file folder. &quot;Just look into it...and be careful, 
ok?&quot; Rei smirked and sat back in her chair. &quot;Please Captain...I can handle 
it...&quot;
 
===================
 
She had been sloppy...they both had...now the police...gods, they were going 
to be in trouble when they arrived home...
 
She felt a comforting hand on her shoulder. &quot;Don&#146;t worry...I&#146;m sure we&#146;ll 
be forgiven, love...&quot;
 
She didn&#146;t understand...she was so sweet, and despite the fact that it was 
endearing...she had no idea...
 
&quot;Michiru...she will not be happy...this has never happened before..ever..&quot;
 
The aqua haired girl looked slightly affronted, but she sighed, and 
gently brushed a stray strand of blond hair from her lover&#146;s face. &quot;I 
know Ruka, but...we&#146;ll be fine...and you said yourself....the animals aren&#146;t 
enough anymore...we need humans...&quot;
 
Haruka frowned, &quot;I know, Michiru! And she said we could! But damn...we 
were sloppy about it...we should have destroyed the bodies.&quot; She saw 
Michiru shudder.
 
&quot;Ruka...how grotesque...destroy them? How? Rip their bodies to 
shreds...disgusting.&quot;
 
Haruka sighed, and softly laughed in the moonlit night. &quot;You are 
such...a girl sometimes, darling...&quot;
 
===================
 
She forced down a laugh as she watched the young man clumsily run down 
the streets. He thought he would just get away with calling her such 
names, hmm? How dare he! Monster? Beast? And the worst...the little 
bastard called her a whore. Fueled by anger, she swooped upon him, 
holding him close, her warm breath against his neck. &quot;Before I kill you 
darling,&quot; she whispered in his ear, causing the hair on the back of his 
neck to stand up, &quot;I&#146;d like to tell you my name.&quot; She licked his 
earlobe, and he shivered, whimpering weakly. &quot;It is not monster,&quot; her 
lips brushed down to his neck, &quot;nor beast,&quot; she kissed the pulse, 
smiling softly as he gasped, &quot;nor whore..&quot; her fangs grazed across the 
beating pulse of his neck, &quot;it is,&quot; and her voice morphed into a snarl, 
&quot;Minako..&quot; She bit down into his neck, savoring the sweet, precious 
taste of his blood, reveling in it, moaning softly. She sighed softly, 
still drunk on the euphoric taste of his blood, the sweet scent of it 
making her nostrils flare, and whispered, &quot;And the power...and the 
glory...forever and ever...&quot;

&quot;Amen..&quot; 
 
===================

It was too dark outside. Her mother had told her to come home early, but 
she had got sidetracked.  &quot;Umino..&quot; she whispered, trying to keep her 
voice from shaking, &quot;where are you?&quot; She did not hear the rustling of a 
cape behind her. &quot;Umino....where could he have gone?&quot; She detected a 
slight movement in the shadows. &quot;Who...who&#146;s there?&quot; A soft, slightly 
husky voice spoke, and the girl almost immediately took a step back. &quot;I 
am...Setsuna. And Umino is not here...he&#146;s a bit preoccupied.&quot; She did not 
care to mention that another one of her &quot;sisters&quot; had already taken care 
of him. Like a flash, she was behind the petite woman, idly brushing the 
strands of red hair away from the girl&#146;s neck. &quot;What is your name?&quot; She 
asked, her voice just barely audible. &quot;N-Naru,&quot; the girl stammered, 
trying to ignore the grip the taller woman had on her. Setsuna sighed 
softly,` and gently strummed her fingers along the other woman&#146;s 
jawline, taking delight in the shiver that ensued. &quot;Naru...you should not 
be out this late. Perhaps you should go home.&quot; She released Naru, and watched with a hint of amusement as she stumbled along, trying to find 
her equilibrium. She shrugged, and smiled as the girl gained her 
bearings, walking out of the alley. And then she stopped. &quot;Wait...how 
did she know Umino&#146;s na&#151;&quot; Before she could finish the thought, Setsuna 
was already there, sinking her teeth into the delicate skin of the 
redhead&#146;s neck. &quot;So sweet,&quot; she murmured softly, &quot;and oh, won&#146;t Umino be 
happy to know you&#146;re joining him...&quot;
 
===================

Rei sighed softly, staring at the body of the teenager. Taking a shot in 
the dark, she checked the girl&#146;s neck. &quot;Fuck,&quot; she hissed, noticing the 
miniscule puncture marks. Two of them, as neat as could be. &quot;Boys,&quot; she 
called out to the other officers, &quot;we&#146;ve got us a goddamn lunatic!&quot; 
Five...no...at least six in one night, she thought, raking her fingers 
through her raven-black hair, what kind of monster could be doing this? 
Another officer, one she particularly didn&#146;t like, ran over to her. 
&quot;Hino-san, we found another...a boy this time.&quot; Rei sighed. &quot;Did you check 
for the wounds, Yuuchirou?&quot; Yuuchirou shook his head gravely, brushing 
his shaggy hair from his face. &quot;Yes ma&#146;am...the same thing. Um...I was 
wondering..&quot; Rei clenched her teeth. &quot;Yes, Officer?&quot; Yuuchirou shuffled 
a little bit. &quot;Um...maybe, after um...after you&#146;re done, we could go out 
somewhere?&quot; Rei bit her lip to keep from screaming. &quot;Officer...I&#146;m gonna 
be on this for a looong time...I don&#146;t have time.&quot; Yuuchirou looked 
slightly hurt. &quot;Oh...I see. Well...um...ok.&quot; He walked off, and Rei sighed 
weakly. &quot;Damn...I&#146;m always the bad guy.&quot;
 
===================
 
&quot;Blood is life. We need the blood...but foolishness...is not tolerated.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes Mistress,&quot; they all murmured softly, almost simultaneously looking 
down.
 
&quot;I am...ashamed in all of you. The authorities will be keeping a close eye 
on night activity...if we are discovered...we will have to leave again. Be 
careful.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes Milady..&quot;
 
&quot;And especially you older ones. Has your lust for blood truly blinded 
you? Must I show you what happens to our kind when they are discovered?&quot; 
The woman&#146;s voice had taken on a slight edge.
 
&quot;No Mistress,&quot; some of the others murmured, Haruka among them.
 
&quot;Well then...heed my words. Be careful. I need to rest...I have not fed in a 
while...&quot;
 
&quot;Milady,&quot; Minako said, looking concerned, the firelight playing shadows 
on her alabaster skin, &quot;might you like to join the hunt tomorrow?&quot;
 
&quot;No. I simply need rest. I will be fine.&quot;
 
&quot;Alright...&quot;
 
The others left to let the woman rest, and before she fell into a 
restless slumber, she watched the firelight dim, and then flicker out.
 
&quot;Blood...is...life...and we steal it...we are thieves...murderers...&quot;
 
She did not notice as tears blurred her vision....
