----------------------------------------------------------------------

Haruka didn&#39;t snore in the strictest sense of the word, but she did make 
a soft whispery whistle sound every time she breathed.  Michiru watched 
as the Uranian Princess slept, her chest rising and falling with each 
breath, sun-darkened skin changing color as the light and shadows moved.  
She was so calm, so beautiful, so velvety soft.  Michiru reached out and 
caressed her lover&#39;s cheek, leaning over to kiss her slightly-parted 
lips.  Haruka&#39;s hands snaked out from under the blanket and pulled 
Michiru closer as the woman pulled herself to full consciousness.
 
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Haruka whispered when Michiru pulled away.  &quot;What was 
that for?&quot;
 
&quot;I like the sound you make when you&#39;re sleeping.  That whistling 
whispery sound.&quot;
 
Haruka shook her head.  &quot;You are so strange, Michi.&quot;
 
&quot;I know.  Michi?&quot;
 
Haruka shrugged and stretched, relieving some of the tension in her 
muscles.  &quot;It sounded nice in my mind.  Do you mind?&quot;

&quot;No.  Michi is fine.  What should I call you?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
 
Michiru shrugged, her aqua hair tickling Haruka&#39;s belly and breasts 
every time she breathed.  &quot;A pet name.  Like Michi.  What should I call 
you?&quot;
 
Haruka shrugged, running a finger down Michiru&#39;s soft cheek.  &quot;Call me 
what you want to.&quot;  She rolled over and looked out the window.  &quot;What 
time is it?&quot;
 
&quot;Midday, time for lunch.  We should get up, because I&#39;m hungry, even if 
you&#39;re not.&quot;
 
&quot;What do you mean, &#39;you&#39;re hungry&#39;?  Miss perfect princess who always 
nibbles her food admitting that her little tummy is empty?&quot;
 
&quot;Watch it, blondie; I&#39;m not so perfect anymore, not after I met you.  
I&#39;m a rebel.&quot;
 
Haruka laughed at the sight of Michiru, trying her best to look 
threatening, her tousled hair and smile making her look cute and so 
kissable.  &quot;I&#39;m going to kiss you now,&quot; she warned before leaning up and 
letting their lips touch.  What she had intended as friendly quickly 
morphed, and she felt her passions rising once more.  She pulled away a 
moment later, her stomach threatening to do something drastic if she 
wasted more time in her lover&#39;s arms, catching her aqua-haired wife&#39;s 
wandering hands and pulling them up where she could see them.  &quot;Huh.  
Would you look at that.  Now you&#39;re the sexmaniac.&quot;
 
&quot;I knew you were contagious!&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;d better get away before it gets any worse.&quot;  Michiru purred as she 
moved on top of Haruka, resting her entire weight on her lover.  Haruka 
groaned and pushed her off.  &quot;Come on, please don&#39;t.  I want to as much 
as you, but our bodies require sustenance to sustain prolonged 
activity.&quot;
 
&quot;I never get to have any fun,&quot; the princess pouted.  She heard Haruka&#39;s 
stomach protest the extended fast, and she smiled.  &quot;Are you hungry, 
Haruka?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m always hungry.  Please let me up before I faint from malnutrition.&quot; 
 
&quot;That will never be a problem.&quot;  Michiru rolled to one side as Haruka 
slipped out of bed, sauntered to the closet, and rifled through the 
suits and dresses hanging there. 
 
&quot;I wonder what I should wear,&quot; she murmured to herself.  &quot;What about 
this one?&quot;
 
Michiru laughed.  &quot;Not a chance!  That&#39;s my dress!&quot;
 
Haruka twirled, the sparkling gold dress wrapping around her long legs.  
&quot;You said you wanted to see me in dresses.&quot;
 
&quot;I do,&quot; Michiru conceded as she joined her lover, &quot;but if you think you 
I am going to let you leave our room wearing THAT you are sadly 
mistaken!&quot;
 
Haruka could hear the laugh in her wife&#39;s mind, so she grinned and 
crossed her arms over her chest.  &quot;I don&#39;t have to wear anything at all.  
I don&#39;t mind.&quot;
 
&quot;Moons of Neptune, no!  You&#39;d have more suitors than ever!&quot;  At the 
blonde&#39;s challenging smile, Michiru sighed.  &quot;Okay, sweetheart, you win.  
If you want to wear dresses and let the whole kingdom know that you&#39;re a 
woman, go for it.&quot;

Haruka watched her wife slip into an aquamarine dress, its delicately 
laced and gemmed hem softly caressing the deep carpet.  Her tone became 
serious.  &quot;It&#39;s not up to me, Michi.  What about you?  If the rest of 
the world knows, you&#39;ll be the one most effected, not me.&quot;
 
Michiru took the sparkling dress and held it up to Haruka, tilting her 
head.  &quot;This was always a little too long for me, anyway.  It was a gift 
from my aunt, even though I told her gold isn&#39;t really my color.  It 
would look good on you, love.  Wear it, though I have no shoes for you.&quot;  
The taller Senshi raised an eyebrow, and Michiru laughed.  &quot;I&#39;ll have 
some made while we eat with the royals.  Put it on.&quot;
 
Haruka slipped the golden dress on, letting Michiru help her fasten it.  
Her back was bare, revealing the toned muscles she used for running and 
fighting, and she shivered.  &quot;I am going to freeze in this thing!  It 
has no back.&quot;  She looked down at the incredibly low neckline and raised 
an eyebrow.  &quot;Isn&#39;t the point of clothing to cover yourself?  Why, then, 
does this dress insist on showing my breasts?&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s the point,&quot; Michiru laughed, making a few adjustments.  &quot;Most 
women want everyone to see their attributes.  If you have such nice 
breasts you should show them off.&quot;
 
She stepped back and turned around slowly, letting her wife look at her.  
&quot;What do you think?&quot;
 
Michiru&#39;s sapphire eyes were sparkling.  &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful, Ruka.  So 
very beautiful.  Why do you hide behind men&#39;s clothing?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ve never had anybody to notice before,&quot; Haruka whispered, her voice 
lighter and far more feminine than Michiru had ever heard it.  &quot;I never 
had anybody to dress up for.&quot;
 
&quot;You have me now, Ruka, and you always will.&quot;  Michiru leaned up to kiss 
her wife.  &quot;Let&#39;s go eat now.  After last night, I need something to 
keep my energy up.&quot;  Haruka chuckled and caught Michiru&#39;s hand as she 
followed her lover into the hall and headed for the dining room.  She 
bowed to the other royals waiting as she sat down, smiling secretly at 
the murmurs spreading.  They had been told that she was a woman, but 
they never really believed it.  Haruka looked at the varied foods 
arranged before her and blushed slightly when her stomach growled.
 
&quot;I never imagined that you could look so much like your mother until I 
saw you in that dress,&quot; Shousha commented.  &quot;You look nice.&quot;  The meal 
progressed smoothly after that, Michiru leaving for a moment to have 
shoes made for Haruka to match her dress.  Just before the meal ended, 
the Neptunian Queen turned to her daughter and daughter-in-law.  &quot;Are 
you two heading back to Ten&#39;ousei today?&quot;
 
&quot;I imagine so, yes.  I miss my father.&quot;
 
&quot;Our Queen has a mission for you, young princess.  Serenity says that 
her daughter has gone on a tour, shall we say, and her mother cannot 
find her.  She would appreciate your help, since you know the young 
princess so well.&quot;
 
Haruka looked at Shousha, and her green eyes widened.  &quot;Oh.  Sure, we&#39;ll 
go.  As soon as we pack for the trip, Michiru and I will head for the 
Moon.&quot;  Serenity was on Earth and her mother had no idea where she went.
 
After the meal, the other royal families decided to return to their 
homes, and they gathered in the transport room to bid farewell to the 
queen, her daughter, and her daughter-in-law.  The four Inner Princesses 
smiled as Haruka and Michiru embraced them, having formed a wondrous 
bond of friendship that marked a great Senshi team.  &quot;Good luck,&quot; Makoto 
whispered as she and Ami vanished with the Mizuno family.  Rei would not 
be so expressive, but she smiled as she and Minako disappeared with the 
Aino royal family.  Kazan kissed Michiru&#39;s hand, smiling as he joined 
his parents and little sister.
 
&quot;Maybe I was a little sore because I lost to a girl,&quot; the prince 
admitted.  &quot;I&#39;ll say this; the best man won.&quot;  Haruka laughed at the 
family vanished, taking Michiru&#39;s hand as Makoto&#39;s brothers gathered 
around them.
 
&quot;Well, you seem to have done alright after all,&quot; Ken&#39;nin grinned.  &quot;You 
may look like a prince, but do try to remember that you are the princess 
and heir of the Ten&#39;ousei kingdom.  Fun is good, but there are 
responsibilities there for you.  You&#39;ll have to worry about your kingdom 
one day, once you finally settle down.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll try to remember, Ken&#39;nin-kun.  Thank you for being so kind to us.&quot;  
Haruka bowed to the princes, then she stepped back and curtsied.  &quot;Good 
luck.&quot;
 
The princes left, vanishing with their parents, and Haruka crossed her 
arms, staring at Setsuna.  &quot;Well?  What are you thinking about?&quot;
 
Setsuna took one of Haruka&#39;s hands in her free one, closing her eyes a 
moment.  &quot;You have changed, young princess.  I think this trip has done 
you good.  Good luck, no matter what happens.&quot;
 
Michiru touched Setsuna&#39;s arm before Haruka pulled away, and the 
red-eyed queen gasped as a vision seared itself in her mind.  Haruka and 
Michiru, Uranus and Neptune, lay on the ground, fading away, reaching 
for each other.  Their fingers touched, and both smiled as they died.
 
Setsuna jerked back, touching her forehead with her free hand.  &quot;Please 
don&#39;t do that again.&quot;
 
&quot;Do what?&quot;  Michiru reached out to help the queen, sensing that she 
shouldn&#39;t touch the tall, green-haired woman.
 
&quot;You can&#39;t both touch me at the same time.  I see things, visions of the 
future that I don&#39;t want to.  Just don&#39;t do it, okay?&quot;  Haruka and 
Michiru nodded as Setsuna took Hotaru&#39;s hand.  &quot;I&#39;m going to take her 
home now, and I will see you guys again.  Farewell.&quot;  She vanished.
 
Shousha touched Haruka&#39;s arm.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about her.  She has never 
wanted more than one Senshi touching her at once.  Our conflicting 
destinies and the visions she has of things that may or may not happen 
always upset her.  She could have seen anything.&quot;
 
Haruka led Michiru back to their room, and they gathered the last of 
their belongings.  &quot;Are you ready to head for the Moon?&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Serenity looked up from her boyfriend&#39;s shoulder as the wind suddenly 
picked up, powerful and ready for action.  Shocked, Serenity looked 
around and spotted the tall woman in an exquisite golden dress sitting 
on a large, smooth rock nearby, an aqua-haired woman beside her.  
Standing up, Serenity and Endymion faced the pair.  &quot;Haruka-kun?  You&#39;re 
wearing . . . a dress?&quot;
 
The Uranian Senshi grinned, one knee pulled up to her chin, fancy golden 
half-boots resting on the rock.  &quot;It was Michiru&#39;s idea.  How have you 
been?&quot;
 
&quot;I ran away.&quot;
 
Haruka raised an eyebrow, feeling Michiru&#39;s hand on her arm.  &quot;I see 
that.  To Earth, though?  Your mother knows that you&#39;re here.&quot;
 
Serenity nodded, the golden crescent moon on her forehead shining in the 
sunlight.  &quot;I knew that she&#39;d never come here.&quot;
 
&quot;She worries about you.  She loves you a lot, Koneko-chan.  You should 
go home.&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe she wants to stay here with me.&quot;
 
&quot;As much as I respect you, Endymion-san, she has a kingdom and a destiny 
to worry about.&quot;
 
&quot;I went to the party,&quot; Serenity whispered.  &quot;We both did.  And when we 
got back, Mother said I could never see him again.  So I left.&quot;
 
Haruka left her rock and joined the pair.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s do this.  Come 
back with me, and we&#39;ll make a deal with your mother.  You can&#39;t come to 
Earth, but he can visit the Moon as long as he is in some sort of 
disguise.&quot;
 
&quot;You can get her to agree to that?&quot;
 
Michiru laughed.  &quot;She already has.  Come on, let&#39;s go.&quot;</pre>
