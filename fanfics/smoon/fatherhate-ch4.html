<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ring. Ring. Ring.</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  ears perked up and she ran to where the phone was, leaping over the arm  of the couch and sprawling over Setsuna, just to pick it up and go,  “Moshi moshi! Meioh and Aino residence! Minako speaking!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“M-Minako-chan?” Oh dear Lord…was that…?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan?” Minako gasped, catching Setsuna’s attention. “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-it’s Rei! She’s…oh God she’s…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usa,” Minako began, masking her growing fear with a soothing voice.” I can’t help if you don’t tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s been shot Minako-chan!” Usagi dissolved into sobs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna  caught the phone before it slipped from Minako’s limp fingers. “Usagi,  tell me everything.” Setsuna commanded, gently holding Minako as the  blonde tried to absorb the information. After hearing the story-minus  the activates that they had participated in-Setsuna herself was near  tears. “Where is Rei hospitalized Usagi-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-Seidou. Just…get here quickly okay? Ami-chan and Mako-chan already told the others—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  be there as soon as we can Usagi-chan.” Setsuna promised, before  hanging up. She let out a watery sigh and clutched her Venusian Senshi  in a brief hug. Minako whimpered, quietly, before standing up with  Setsuna and leading the green-haired woman to the car.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seidou  Hospital wasn’t the biggest or the fanciest, but there was no denying  that it was the best, thanks to its large supply of well-seasoned  doctors, surgeons and nurses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Added to the fact that none other than Mizuno Shizuro was on their staff, Seidou was truly the beast option.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami  knew, without a doubt, that her mother would never allow one of her  friends to die. The fact that Rei’s wound wasn’t particularly life  threatening was also a plus. There was very little surgery required,  thank the gods, even though the wound was dangerously close to her  heart. The bullet had torn a bit of tissue, but Ami knew that if it  hadn’t exited Rei’s body, the situation would be much more dire.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto,  on the other hand, was much like her element at this point. Deadly and  unpredictable; bloodthirsty, as much it worried Ami to admit it. While  Makoto would be in a similar state if one of the Outers were injured  like this, the severity of Makoto’s temper would be tempered, if only  by a small fraction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it had been Rei. One of the Inners.  Their group had faced death and Hell together, and they were as much a  family even though their birth certificates and blood said otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll fucking kill him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The growl startled Ami out of her revere. “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m gonna fucking wring that bastard’s <em>throat</em>.”  Makoto snarled from her position of leaning on the wall. She hadn’t  moved from her spot once since coming into the waiting room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who?” Ami whispered, a tinge of fear tugging at the end of her question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Him.</em>” The brunette hissed. “Her so-called <em>father</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mako-chan—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t try and talk me out of it Ami!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We don’t have any proof that he—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  got his stink all over it! I don’t need proof to know that he did it!  Motherfucking sicko, just to get his hands on the Jinjia! I swear I’ll—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Makoto.”  The cold, icy tone that Ami rarely used stopped Makoto’s rant in record  time. The Senshi of Jupiter gulped. “I was trying to say we don’t have  any proof…yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Emerald eyes widened. “Y-you mean—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  going to find the culprit.” Ami’s blue eyes flashed dangerously. “And I  know just the way to do it. A gun, when fired, leaves a microscopic ion  trail invisible the naked eye and the most advanced Earth technology.  This ion trail sticks to anything; including skin. It is impossible to  wash out without the proper elements, which our scientists haven’t  figured out yet. So the trail will be very easy to follow, assuming no  one fired a gun near our culprit’s ion trail. They could—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ami-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, yes Mako-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Japanese please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. Gomen Mako-chan. In simple terms, we would need technology far beyond today in order to track him or her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the point of this explanation is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We have Mercurian technology Mako-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a brief moment of silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ami-chan, I am seriously in love with you right now.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  this is it. The spot where Rei was…” Sailor Jupiter left the sentence  hanging, not that Mercury needed to be told. The blue haired Senshi  nodded and activated her visor. The Mercurian technology bleeped and  flashed, producing streams of data that, to an inexperienced user,  would have been impossible to follow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But if there was one thing Ami was, it was a well-seasoned veteran of computers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  mother told my that the bullet was a nine millimeter. Just let me input  the data into my computer…” Mercury’s fingers flew over the miniature  keyboard with impassable accuracy, entering the correct data and  pressing enter. There was a tense silence as they waited for the  results. Sailor Mercury smiled and let out a sound of triumph as a  silvery trail appeared on her visor-the ion trail.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve got it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  then, what the hell are we waiting for?” Sailor Jupiter smirked,  slamming a fist in her palm. “Let’s get that little bastard!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury  giggled at her lover’s enthusiasm, silently pondering why Jupiter had  never been this energetic during one of their dates…<em>A question for later. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Mercury put away her compact computer and  adjusted her visor so that it would only pick up ion trails similar to  the one they needed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two hours later would find Sailor Mercury and Jupiter outside the house of the suspected culprit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure?” Sailor Jupiter asked, popping her knuckles.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Positive. The ion trail ends here, not counting that bundle of clothes we found in the garbage a while back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good.”  Jupiter lifted a leg and rammed it into the solid wood of the door,  smiling almost manically when it gave way under her superhuman strength.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Knock knock.” The brunette Senshi hissed as she entered the dwelling of Rei’s attacker.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury  flinched at her friend’s tactless entry. The very brief desire to shout  out, ‘Who’s There?!’ crossed her mind. Shaking her head and muttering  something about, “hanging around Minako too much.” She followed Sailor  Jupiter in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Holy sh—Who the hell are you!?” Shrieked a  middle-aged man who had been cozying on his couch. Sailor Jupiter  strode over and turned on the light.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh <em>fuck!!</em>” the man  screamed, recognizing the two figures as Juuban’s very own Sailor  Senshi. He tried to scramble away, only for Jupiter to fist the front  of his shirt roughly and slam him against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now we can  do this easy my friend,” Jupiter began, her voice just barely hiding  the growl in her throat. “Mercury here has a lie detector built into  her computer; she’ll know when you’re lying.” Mercury summoned her  computer and set up the program.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me,” Jupiter applied a bit  of pressure to the man’s windpipe. “Why did you shoot the girl?” The  man wheezed, but answered truthfully, “I-I was paid to!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor  Jupiter cast a look to Mercury and received a nod. Returning to the  task at hand she loosened her grip on the man’s neck. “You’re an  assassin?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He took in a few gulps of air and scowled a bit. “In a manner of speaking…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who took out a contract on her?” Sailor Mercury asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  girl? Sorry lady, that’s classified informa—“ He was cur off again as  Jupiter reapplied pressure. “Okay! Senator Takeda!” The brunette let  out a small snarl of frustration.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Last</em> name dumbass!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hino! It was Senator Takeda Hino!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A/N:  Oh c’mon. How many of you saw that coming? And please don’t ask me if  that ion-trail thingie crap is true. It’s not. That was what we authors  call, a clever plot-device.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seidou- Sanctuary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seidou Hospital- No friggin clue what the real hospital is called. Soooooo, we have an OP- Original Place!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Takeda Hino- No idea what his real name is. Aaaaaand I wasn’t going to look for the translation for “bastard”.</span></p>
