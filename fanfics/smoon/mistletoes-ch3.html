(Usagi)
Quietly I slipped away from the dark corner I had been hiding in, 
unseen by both Minako and Hotaru. I had seen enough, the healing was 
starting to begin. Inwardly I was as much surprised as I was 
relieved. Never had I anticipated that this night would work out so 
smoothly. Sure, there still would be a lot of work to be done, a lot 
of barriers had to be torn down but my two friends had made the first 
step in the right direction. Towards a better future, that would look 
at least a little brighter than this one. They deserved it.
	Looking back one last time, I smiled softly as Minako and 
Hotaru continued their kiss for a small eternity under the arch of 
the roof. A lone mistletoe had been hung over them. You could almost 
grasp the love radiating from them and also the tension leaving the 
air.
	I took this at my cue to leave. As pure as the kiss was, 
surely it would not be the only thing exchanged tonight. Walking 
through the darkened streets, my thoughts kept wandering back to my 
two friends in the backyard of the bar. Maybe their lives would look 
up now, maybe they could get some normality into them again. And 
maybe, just maybe I would be able to do so as well. Seeing them 
happy, made me happy and I would do anything to keep it that way.
	So lost in my thoughts, I hadn&#39;t really paid attention to my 
surroundings, other than the general way back home. That proved to be 
fatal.

(Hotaru)
As lips finally parted, I could not quite describe what I felt. 
Relief? Desire? Hope? Fear? But one thing that was sure like a 
constant was the spark of emotion, of a good emotion. A feeling had 
suddenly ripped right through the shell I had put it in ever since 
the fateful day. Love. The love for the amazing, blonde angel who had 
once again totally turned my world upside down and melted every 
resistance there might be, every hate and harsh feelings like butter. 
With one touch, one kiss there had been more said and done as in 
years before. It left me vulnerable, exposed and more than a little 
scared. Scared of what was about to come, the consequences. Tomorrow, 
I was sure I would face the world differently and I wasn&#39;t sure how I 
felt about it.
	&quot;Minako...&quot; I breathed in a hushed whisper as gentle fingers 
were tiptoeing on my cheek. I stared up in blue eyes and wondered if 
it was possible to get lost in them. Lost in these orbs sparkling 
with the kind of adoration that made you all tingly inside. I was 
slowly losing myself in the situation.
	&quot;Are you alright now?&quot; her voice soft but inquiring broke 
through the helpless state she had sent me into herself. Slowly I 
nodded and brought my own hands up to caress her face. Following a 
sudden urge I pulled her head down and this time the contact was much 
more heated, fueling the flame of passion between us anew, just like 
on this evening a few days ago, but this time I hoped it would not be 
blown out again. Tongues soon met in a game for dominance and I could 
feel her hands on my hips with the clear intentions of moving 
somewhere far less clothed.
	I growled deeply but pulled her up anyways. It was hard to 
resist the primal call from my body but I had to make sure that this 
would not turn out as the last time. Minako didn&#39;t seem to be 
offended by the temporally repulsion. I put a finger on her lips to 
still her question. &quot;Not here. Let&#39;s go over to my place. It&#39;s just a 
few blocks.&quot; She nodded, her face lightening up a bit. I suppose she 
had feared that I had changed my mind and would reject her. &quot;If you 
don&#39;t want to, we don&#39;t have to...&quot; she started but I just shook my 
head and took one of her hands between mine. &quot;Just promise that you 
won&#39;t vanish on me again.&quot;
	Minako looked down at our intertwined hands and then back up 
to me. Her eyes sincere and her smile kind of shy. &quot;I won&#39;t.&quot;

(Usagi)
I had no time to react. Looking back on this event I should have been 
able to do something. While mostly despising physical strength my 
developed body was as much attuned to the benefits of my Senshi self 
as Minako and Hotaru&#39;s were.
	As it was I was brought rudely out of my thoughts when hands 
grabbed me from behind in a steel-like embrace and pushed me into a 
nearby alley. All was happening so fast I could barely follow. At one 
moment I was walking down the street to my home, happy about the 
successful matchmaking and the next I was thrust brutally against the 
stone wall of a back alley.
	Thick hands started to rip through my clothing and I gasped 
as another pair tore down my pants with almost systematical force. 
The strong, definitely male hands reached up to grip my breasts and 
squeeze down as if they were just buttons that could be pressed.
	Enduring the inevitable ordeal until now in silence I cried 
out as I felt my unknown attackers dick being rammed right up my butt 
without warning. My head snapped up and I felt my vision blur, almost 
whiten from the hot, blazing sting. I could not believe how much pain 
there was as my insides were filled against their will and beyond any 
capacity. Through the tears of anguish I caught a glimpse of a woman 
in front of me. I would not have made the connection from the leather 
jacket and the dyed-scarlet hair alone but the marks on her throat, 
almost impossible to be seen in the darkness, made it horribly clear 
who I had happened to run into.
	That recognition was not a relief though as behind me another 
thrust rocked me forward and I would have let loose with another 
bloody scream, if my own bra hadn&#39;t been forced into my mouth. The 
woman grabbed my hips, her fingernails scraping my flesh sharply and 
without warning bent forward to dive between my traitorous dripping-
wet pussy lips. It didn&#39;t have much to do with the term of 
lovingly &quot;eating someone out&quot; though.
	I simply pressed my eyes tightly shut as another wave of 
agony crashed through me as the cock behind me was drawn back and 
lined up for another thrust while the woman did not waste time with 
stimulating either as I felt her teeth smash down hard on my clit 
immediately sending another orgasm that had nothing to do with 
pleasure through me.

(Minako)
Hotaru fondled nervously with her keys. I could not blame her that 
her concentration was evaporating into the cold air of the late hour. 
We had barely made it to her home with our clothing still intact. Her 
leather jacket was open and I had lost mine already, only loosely 
hanging from my sleeves. Before the raven-haired beauty had found the 
lock completely, she had to suddenly stop and gasp as my hands 
couldn&#39;t be restrained any longer and found their way under her shirt 
and bra. I was delighted to see that the nipples under my touch 
already stood to attention. The small moans I drew out while making 
small, circular patterns on her sensitive skin turned into a 
surprised squeal as in one incredible maneuver I had managed to 
withdraw my hands, holding the black leather bra in my hands. So, 
little Hotaru was a bit of a fetish, ne?
	Staring at me with round eyes, as she finally managed to 
unlock the door, Hotaru only managed a weak &quot;How?&quot; before I had her 
inside the apartment and the door shut. I think we knocked a lot of 
things over that lay in our path towards the bedroom. My attack was 
swift and furious as I let loose on the tight control I usually 
regaled myself with, even with Usagi. This time though it was not a 
haze of alcohol clouding my mind but an open, honest expression of 
feelings.
	Hotaru found herself bare of anything but her panties - 
leather too - when we finally managed to find her small but cozy 
bedroom. The shriek from suddenly being airborne and landing on the 
bed, turned into almost ceremonial silence when I climbed onto the 
bed on the edge. Slowly, lecherously I crawled up her naked body like 
a cat cornering her prey, refusing any kind of contact. Hotaru&#39;s eyes 
followed my ascend transfixed as I took in every inch, every subtle 
movement of her birthday&#39;s suit at once. Finally coming up to the 
same level as her my desire-filled eyes found hers and the whimper 
from her mouth was enough to ignite the love I felt for the smaller 
girl ablaze anew.
	&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful.&quot; Hotaru whimpered again and was now 
squirming at the loss of contact, almost whined when I sat up 
momentarily, straddling her hips and the sounds turned into another 
series of gasps and moans when I slowly slipped out of my shirt and 
bra. Taking in the white, albino skin so naturally beautiful and the 
absolute obvious want in her eyes, my decision was already made. No 
stops today. I would give her everything. My colleagues from work 
knew from experience that I was good, a natural talent but I had 
always resigned myself to a certain control. Before this night was 
over I would make the wonderful, young woman below squirm and 
shudder, yes beg before bringing her to release. No less she deserved.

(Hotaru)
Goddess, was it that what girls and women alike went on about? 
Feeling like the most special woman alive? If yes then I was 
certainly already beyond that point. The wanton need I could easily 
read in the blonde&#39;s eyes was breathtaking. This wasn&#39;t a dream, this 
wasn&#39;t a fantasy, Minako really did want me. Me. Wow...
	Her body I noted with fascination was like a sculpture, the 
work of a great artist and definitely worthy of her nickname. A 
Goddess of Love and Beauty she truly was. Her breasts not too big, 
just... right, wonderfully round-shaped, already hardened now from 
her own arousal. Her skin flawless, without any traces, neither 
battle scars nor love markings. It seemed to be actually glowing in 
my eyes.
	I craved more contact, wanted this beautiful angel to touch 
me, wanted to touch her myself but to my dismay she slapped my eager 
hands away and waved one finger in front of my face. Before I could 
voice a protest there was only a flash of movement warning me, as 
lips tickled and caressed my earlobe. No teeth, no nibbling, just 
kissing and I could not believe how good that felt.
	A shudder ran down my spine as the blonde vixen continued her 
torture-like treatment of kisses down my cheeks and on my neck and 
throat, momentarily reaching up to bring my mouth to hers but again 
denying the pleasure of the tongue. Whimpering under her touch she 
continued downward on my chest, as her hands were added below, 
fingernails, just the nails, stroking along my inner thighs, stopping 
inches away from the entrance of my lips below which were burning 
with anticipation by now. I growled as she withdraw, instead 
continuing her treatment on my ass cheeks with the same restraint as 
before.
	Meanwhile her lips had found my right breast and I wanted to 
scream for her to stop killing me a thousands times over with that 
sweet but unfulfilling kisses, brushing over my by now hypersensitive 
skin. Like a mantra, the only thing I could mumble was a 
muffled &quot;Onegai&quot; again and again.
	When she finally did it I was suddenly lifted into a world of 
unbelievable bliss. Without warning her mouth closed over one erect 
nipple, teeth raking on impatiently waiting flesh, sucking the round 
nub in her mouth. My hands gripped the bed sheets and I let loose 
with an almost bloodcurdling screech that I was sure jolted every 
neighbor out of their sleep, as I came from Minako&#39;s mouth on my 
breast alone. I never knew that was possible until now. And from the 
looks of it and the sly grin as she looked up at me through heavy 
eyelids she was not finished by a long shot. I closed my eyes in 
preparation as she turned her attention at my other breast.

(Usagi)
Another bloodcurdling scream was gagged when I felt my tight hole 
penetrated once again by the man&#39;s enormous member that felt like a 
sword hilt inside of me. This time it just wasn&#39;t the bra anymore. 
That has been discarded as I had been forced to &quot;eat out&quot; the 
redheaded woman myself. When the ruthless motions from behind 
increased in relentless speed I could only do so much to hold on as 
complying willingly with my rapists&#39; demands and could only wonder, 
if it was possible to suffocate from swallowing too much cum. I was 
beyond caring though.
	In the last minutes that seemed like an eternity for me the 
two assailants had done almost anything humanly imaginable and beyond 
to my aching and screaming body. Switching positions constantly I had 
been forced to swallow that huge dick until I thought it would go 
right down my throat. While the man was simply brutal and fixed on 
his own pleasure, the woman was worse. She seemed to enjoy the ordeal 
with a maddening gleam in her eyes. Not only did I have to literally 
swallow fluids from her ass until I threw up in disgust but for that 
I only got more punishment from her for my troubles. With her thick 
leather belt she had continued in an appalling rhythm to first whip 
my exposed clit with the metal buckle. I almost passed out from the 
searing, stabbing pain. I could not even scream as the man had taken 
his turn to gag me with his fat ass as he apparently watched 
interested when the women finally rolled up the belt and forced it 
down my swollen, sore, blistering and surely already infected opening 
with a brutality that defied description.
	My tears must have turned bloody somewhere during all 
the &quot;action&quot; and I could only pray that they were finished soon 
because I doubted that I could take much more. The pumping increased 
again while the woman yanked at my odangos to pull my face even 
deeper in her own opening. My breasts were torn apart and above any 
erection state, held by nipple clamps which the woman had pulled out 
with pure delight and chained them on the metal box she was currently 
sitting on. Every thrust, every movement caused them to stretch like 
bubblegum and it hurt like hell.
	My stamina was long gone and if the situation had been 
different I wondered how the male could stand it. He didn&#39;t seem to 
care though as he filled me again and again with his hard member and 
seed.
	And then they suddenly stopped. Leaving me on the verge of 
another unwanted but sadistically needed release with the sticky 
taste of the woman&#39;s salvia smeared around my face. I didn&#39;t dare to 
move despite the agonized cries of my body that was racked with pain, 
cries pounding like a jackhammer in a never-ending rhythm. I heard 
clothing being donned again but still did not dare to do more than 
suck in long breaths of the chilly air that now began to add its 
sensation to my naked and battered body. Senshi stamina be damned, I 
don&#39;t believe even a god could have come out of this without being on 
the verge of death. At this point I think only the Ginsuishou had 
kept me awake and alive.
	&quot;Useless whore,&quot; I heard the feminine laugh behind me, before 
her belt once again struck home setting me off one last time, rocking 
me from the box surface and making my nipples burn as they were 
almost ripped off. &quot;She lasted long though.&quot; The woman laughed again 
as footsteps began to walk away. &quot;Do you feel better now?&quot; the man 
asked. &quot;Much.&quot;

(Minako)
The poor girl was practically out of her mind by the time I finally 
ended my seductive trail of butterfly kisses and took more severe 
action. If I wouldn&#39;t be too occupied I would have applaud myself for 
making Hotaru come from a gentle love bite on her breast alone. I 
knew what she was going through right now and that I was on the verge 
of accomplishing the goal I had set myself. In my dim memory I knew 
that I had done this once before in my past life but wasn&#39;t quite 
sure how or with whom but from that experience alone I was sure 
Hotaru was about to literally pounce me through the bed in an effort 
to satisfy the raging fire that was only fueled more by the first 
release. It was like she was cumming but it felt different, slow. Too 
slow. Instead of scratching that itch inside of her, it was making 
her even hornier!
	Another hoarse scream tore from her throat as I finally 
succumbed to my own hunger and sought out her mounds like devouring 
food. Lips racked over skin that was literally on fire from the 
earlier treatment and my hands instinctively shot up below to press 
two fingers from each hand in her center. Hotaru would have rocked 
off the bed from the sensation if I wouldn&#39;t have pressed her down 
with my own body and her screams of pleasure were music in my ears.
	The sensation on her cum immediately spilling out as my 
fingers squeezed her clit and the wild passion and craziness in her 
eyes as she looked down to me was enough to completely sent me over 
the edge. I think I must have hissed like a wildcat. In one swift 
movement I was down between her swollen pussy lips, widening the 
entrance forcefully with my fingernails and diving right to the 
source. My tongue shot out and hit her delicious button immediately 
while my mouth clamped down on the opening, prepared to take the full 
load of what was to come. And coming it did. With a piercing screech 
that sounded like someone was murdering her over and over again, her 
sweet salvia came rushing out like water behind a dam when a hole was 
smashed into it. I proceeded to drink every inch of.
	The powerful taste and Hotaru&#39;s hand clawing on my head, 
pushing me even further in to the point where it wasn&#39;t possible 
anymore, I felt my passion-ignited mind totally slip into a frenzy. 
The smell was intoxicating, like a drug leaving you totally 
lightheaded and I could feel my body quiver from a sudden orgasm that 
hit me so unexpected that I had to cease my actions momentarily. She 
hadn&#39;t even done anything but the heat that was charging the air with 
pure energy was so strong I felt like being electrocuted from the 
experience of bringing her to release alone.
	Acting on my own fire down below I smashed one thigh in 
between hers, crashing our centers together and sending both of us 
over the edge immediately. I fell forward, seeking out her breasts 
once again for some time, before devouring her mouth with a hunger 
leaving her panting afterwards. Her hands were on my back, 
fingernails digging into my flesh and when I rocked forward even 
further, my pelvis now not far from defying the impossible of being 
merged with hers, Hotaru didn&#39;t waste any time to pull me down and 
suck... no, make that gnaw on my own blistering breasts.
	I shrieked in ecstasy from the contact and nearly fell off of 
her. It was like a geyser was inside of me and shooting streams of 
hot, burning water up my very soul again and again. It took me a time 
to finally forfeit my own pleasure and move back to the task I had 
set for myself.
	Finally untangling my legs I did not let up on the pace as my 
right hand sought out her center while the other cupped her breast. 
Sliding down her body again, I left a steady, visible trail of 
simultaneously scraped from teeth and softened by tongue and kisses 
skin behind. I had her whimpering, moaning, groaning and panting at 
the same time when I reached her breasts again. Clamping down hard on 
one nipple, I balled up my fingers into a fist below and thrust 
deeply into her core, sending shockwaves through the air from the 
backlash of screaming and power filling the air. It was almost... No, 
it was touchable now, the heavy, prickling sensation of energy and I 
shuddered with tiny, mini-orgasms from that high-charged air on my 
bare skin.
	I hadn&#39;t counted how often I had set Hotaru off with my fist 
and my other hand teasingly fingering the tight hole between her ass 
cheeks but when I finally withdraw, Hotaru amazingly begged in a 
crescendo of cries to continue. Not one to question in such a 
situation, I dipped my head down between her thighs again and latched 
onto the sweet fountain in renewed frenzy.

(Hotaru)
I doubt my mind was still present because any rational thoughts had 
vanished the moment Minako had elicited the first wave of pleasure. 
Instead of a release that I expected I was thrilled to encounter the 
passion slowly filling me and heightening my arousal even further. 
When she started to attack me without restraint, I could feel my very 
soul shooting up from its resting place and latching onto... 
something. With every release, every mixture of sweet pain and bliss 
she brought upon my flesh, the waves of never-ending sensations only 
came in higher quantities. Every nerve ending of my body was 
screaming as my body yielded to the incredulous treatment that this 
human goddess was lavishing on me. Every time my form rocked with the 
steadily heightening shudder of another release. There already was 
the craving for another. I didn&#39;t know someone could last that long 
or set off so much cum in one session but somehow that blonde animal 
managed to do just that.
	My throat was already hoarse from the screaming as her fist 
hit my clit once again with merciless force that was almost 
sadistically arousing. I had to bite down hard on my bottom lip, 
drawing a small line of blood in an effort to not rip my vocal cords 
apart. After that I just thought I couldn&#39;t take any more but as I 
looked down to her, her face hovering over my thighs my body once 
again betrayed any belief as it was craving even more.
	Minako didn&#39;t hesitate either and when her mouth went again 
to the task of literally drinking up my sex-inflicted wetness, I 
reflexively put my legs around her neck as my body shot off from the 
bed like a bowstring being tightened. Squeezing my thighs further 
together to a point where it must have hurt, the only thing I could 
do to hold on to sanity and gravity alike was to claw on the bed 
sheets.
	Like a tape on auto reverse she sucked and licked my clit 
relentlessly as her hands sought out my ass again and pressing into 
the opening throwing away every idea of foreplay. Again and again the 
avalanche of releases tumbled over me and my vision slowly began to 
turn blinding white, spots of multicolored light occasionally adding 
to it.
	Then, finally - although I could honestly not tell me if my 
body did not weep in regret -, Minako ended the ride on the burning 
fires of hell and the sweet currents of heaven alike. In one last 
effort to bring out the most pleasure possible, she managed to do 
everything at once. Her tongue thrusting against my pleasure spot, 
her teeth tightening without restraint around my clit, her fingers in 
my anus, plunged in deeply. Everything together sent such a explosion 
off in my body that I cried out her name to the heavens above in one 
long, drawn-out scream that defied description and any sound barrier. 
My world erupted into a shower of colors in my vision and quivers 
from my body. For one instant, one incredible, long and infinite 
moment I was sure to be completely lifted from the physical plane 
into something higher, something more spiritual, more pure.
	I had no idea at all how much time passed. The next thing I 
managed to weakly register was Minako leaning over me and kissing me 
softly, stroking my damp hair with her fingers. She pulled me on top 
of her and wrapped her arms around my body which was to my amazement 
totally relaxed, in a state where nothing could have inflicted pain, 
so powerfully good it felt.
	My head rested against her chest, just a little above her 
breasts. I was astonished that a small part of me was still able to 
feel regret, regret that she had done most of the work. However, I 
was far too weak to return the favor right now. In the morning maybe 
and that was the last thought before my eyes drifted shut and my 
breathing calmed in blissful happiness. Life was looking up again.

(Usagi)
The alley was silent as I lay unmoving still draped over the box, my 
blistering center still pressed against the metal and the clamps 
still straining my breasts somewhat, more like pressing against them 
harshly as I lay on the surface. I had no idea how long I was lying 
there, the cold, chilly air crawling up and down my body and in an 
ironic way &quot;freezing&quot; the &quot;heat&quot; of the soreness on my whole body.
	It began as a slow ripple of soft fingers and even those were 
leaving burning trails like stigmatizing the skin. At the same time I 
knew though that the wounds, slashes and bite marks were slowly 
fading under the infinite power of the Ginsuishou.
	Slowly I reached up to unhook the nipple clamps, brushing 
over one nipple in the process almost in wonder at how erect it still 
was. What I felt at that moment? Nothing. Completely, totally 
nothing. I had heard and read about rape victims and the experiences 
they were going through, the shame that followed through the rest of 
their lives. But there was nothing at all right now. My mind drew a 
complete blank and my movements were trance-like, almost hypnotic 
when I gathered my barely recognizable clothing and wrapped it as 
best as possible around my slowly freezing skin. I don&#39;t know what 
had befallen me as I reached for the nipple rings on the box and on a 
whim dropped them into the pocket of my jacket.
	Returning to the main street, I resumed my original path back 
home. After all it was late and I had to be home sometime, right? My 
arms were wrapped tightly around my body and my head had fallen down 
to chest level, almost touching breastbone while my legs moved on 
their own, continuing on their path home.
	Useless whore. Even the voice of the woman didn&#39;t seem to be 
able to jolt me out of my state. Useless. Pathetic. Selfish. A good 
ride... whore. Useless. The words kept up and only intensified with 
every step, every beat of my heart. But I didn&#39;t care. What was there 
to care for anyway? I was all this things, had become a sickening, 
twisted mirror of the Princess I once had been and the Queen all had 
hoped I would become. I couldn&#39;t even get my own life in order, 
pitying and losing myself in self-misery. It only served me right to 
be denied touching the happiness that had come into reachable 
distance at the beginning of this night. I didn&#39;t deserve any better, 
I deserved every inch of the beating and mauling I received today. 
Every bit of it.
	Without a noise I slipped into the dark house and up the 
stairs, not disturbing any of the already sleeping occupants. Of 
course they wouldn&#39;t worry, I told them I would stay out late with a 
friend. Okaasan had been pleasantly surprised. Entering my room, I 
locked the door behind me and pulled my useless clothing off. 
Throwing it all into a pile in a corner, I decided to burn the 
evidence first thing in the morning. It wouldn&#39;t do any good for 
someone to accidentally discover it. I wouldn&#39;t deserve the pity 
anyway, they were better off not knowing.
	And Minako and Hotaru? Well, they were happy now, right? I 
still had to make sure that this happiness would last. That was the 
plan and what was I to deviate from my responsibility again because 
of such a trivial matter? No, it did not matter what happened to me 
but I would make sure that they were happy before... Before what? I 
did not know and did not care either.
	As I sat on the edge of the bed I looked down in only mild 
surprise that my hands were playing with the nipple clamps. The 
trance began to cloud any rational thought again as I lay back and 
pulled the covers up before in a clinical fashion snapping the tiny 
metal clamps over my exposed nipples with abrupt force. I whimpered 
slightly but proceeded to fasten the chains hanging loosely from the 
clamps over my clit immediately seeking out the most painful spot, 
pulling both rings together right over the swollen nub.. My knees 
were drawn up to my body to allow access for the short chains and 
every time I tried to stretch jolts of pleasure and pain would be 
racing through my body. Closing my eyes I &quot;gently&quot; rocked back and 
forth as I cried myself to sleep. Life was being dark again.
	Yet what should I care? What else should I expect to deserve 
other than punishment? Punishment for my failure.
