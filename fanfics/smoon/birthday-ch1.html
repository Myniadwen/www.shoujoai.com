<h1>Birthday (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a cold January evening as the group of women made their way
through the streets of the Shinjuku region of Tokyo. Normally a
group of ladies such as this might have problems in this part of
town, but all four of them had a certain aura of danger around them.

Haruka Tenoh lead the way, her business suit hugging the slim
blonde&#39;s form. A member of the Yakuza she was a underboss, in charge
of certain illegal activities in her district and well respected by
the people there. While commonly considered a criminal, she was
looked upon as a protector and business woman here who had gone to
great lengths to help people in need.

&quot;So where was that club again?&quot; Haruka asked wryly, looking around
her in confusion.

&quot;I think it&#39;s a block or so ahead,&quot; Michiru chuckled softly.

Beside her walked Michiru Kaioh, Haruka&#39;s lover and partner. A
classical musician and painter, those who were unaware often thought
of her as a softening influence on Haruka. In truth the green haired
beauty could be as ruthless as her lover, and in many ways more
pragmatic. In the business world of the Yakuza she was Haruka&#39;s
chief negotiator, a woman with cool turquoise eyes that could be
steel hard when needed.

&quot;Neither one of you brought a map?&quot; the tall third woman asked,
amused.

Beside them and watching the crowds warily was their bodyguard, the
amazonian Setsuna Meioh. Nearly half a foot taller and a few years
older, she was officially a accountant in the organization but
everyone knew of her deadly skills. Using anything at hand she could
unleash devastating violence all while still maintaining a cool
smile. Yet, with friends and comrades she was considered gentle and
kind, part of why Haruka had entrusted her with the protection of
the fourth member of their party.

&quot;For a exciting birthday,&quot; the youngest of them noted, &quot;this isn&#39;t
starting well.&quot;

Hotaru Tenoh-Kaioh was the adopted daughter of Haruka and Michiru,
raised as their own for nearly the last ten years. A black haired,
serious child she had grown into a beautiful young woman, even if
she did have a tendency to wear black a bit too much. Her violet
eyes were hard to read by some, but those who knew her could tell
they were brimming with amusement.

&quot;Hotaru,&quot; Haruka protested cheerfully, &quot;didn&#39;t we take you to a
great dinner?&quot;

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll give you that,&quot; Hotaru conceded the point, &quot;and you
can not go wrong with Makoto Kino&#39;s cooking, either. But we&#39;ve been
walking for twenty minutes, looking for this place you wanted us to
go.&quot;

&quot;Now, now,&quot; Michiru teased, &quot;Haruka couldn&#39;t have just stopped for
directions. It&#39;s a male pride thing, I think.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Haruka protested.

&quot;Crowd&#39;s getting a bit thicker up ahead,&quot; Setsuna cooly noted as
they turned a corner, the always elegant woman well aware of the
world around her.

This section of the street was busy, the lighted signs indicating
night clubs and taverns. Men and women waited in line at a few of
the busier places, but one club had the longest line of all.
Called &#39;Luna&#39;s&#39; it seemed incredibly popular, with a long line of
people waiting eagerly to get inside.

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Hotaru asked, feeling a surge of disappointment at the
length of the line. &#39;We&#39;re going to be waiting for hours.&#39;

&quot;There you are, Ms. Tenoh,&quot; the woman watching the line called, her
long black hair gleaming. She wore a slinky red dress, the cloth
shimmering in the light and her smile was gently amused. &quot;What took
you do long?&quot; she asked as they walked up, bypassing the line.

&quot;Haruka refused to ask for directions,&quot; Setsuna shrugged eloquently.

&quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; Haruka pouted a bit.

&quot;Rei Hino,&quot; Michiru gracefully preformed the introductions, &quot;I&#39;d
like you to meet our daughter, Hotaru. It&#39;s her twenty-first
birthday, and we wanted to take her someplace special.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be sure to offer you all a good time,&quot; Rei agreed. She
dropped her voice and stepped closer to Michiru, &quot;Would she prefer
male or female company?&quot;

Michiru&#39;s eyes gleamed with amusement, &quot;She likes the ladies.&quot;

Rei smiled, &quot;Good, then I have just the thing in mind.&quot; Waving to
the group she ordered the doors opened, &quot;Go on in, your table is
waiting.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Hotaru asked suspiciously as they headed inside.

&quot;Wait and see,&quot; Haruka grinned.

&quot;If it helps any we have been here before,&quot; Setsuna
murmured, &quot;though I was driving and we didn&#39;t get lost.&quot; Haruka made
a pained sound while Hotaru chuckled. &quot;I think you&#39;ll have a good
time,&quot; she reassured her.

The club was a bit dimly lit, with tables set up around a long
central stage as scantily clad waitresses moved between tables
serving customers food and drink. Their costumes looked like a cross
between sailor outfits and bathing suits, but with added bows and
decorations. The place had a stylish, almost forties feel, with
period lamps and posters on the walls of film stars.

&quot;Is this a comedy club...?&quot; Hotaru started to ask when she noted the
gleaming metal poles on the main stage and two side stages on either
side. &quot;Oh my god, you didn&#39;t!&quot; she blurted.

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s a strip club,&quot; Michiru chuckled impishly as they all sat
down around a prize table by the main stage, &quot;surprise.&quot;

&quot;Mom,&quot; Hotaru blushed, &quot;I may be into girls but...&quot;

&quot;Welcome to Luna&#39;s,&quot; a young woman said as she walked up to their
table. Her short blue hair gave her a boyish look, while a very
scholarly looking set of glasses gleamed on her face.

&quot;Hello, Ami,&quot; Setsuna nodded, a slightly predatory look stealing
across her face.

&quot;Setsuna,&quot; Ami blushed cutely.

&quot;Friend of your&#39;s?&quot; Haruka asked Setsuna, her expression faintly
surprised.

&quot;We&#39;re acquainted, yes,&quot; Setsuna agreed as the young lady in
question blushed.

&quot;Would you like some drinks,&quot; Ami tried to sound professional as she
asked, &quot;or maybe some snacks before the next show?&quot;

&quot;Wine cooler,&quot; Michiru ordered for herself, &quot;sake for Setsuna,
whiskey for Haruka and...&quot; Michiru looked questioningly at Hotaru.

&quot;Just a coke,&quot; Hotaru smiled, &quot;with a small splash of rum.&quot;

&quot;Any food?&quot; Ami asked politely. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; she bowed
before hurrying off, returning surprisingly quickly with the drinks.

As they settled down the lights dimmed, and a spotlight flashed up
on the stage. A smiling black haired woman strode out, her long
dress swirling around her as she walked into the spotlight. &quot;My name
is Luna,&quot; she smiled, &quot;welcome to my club, I hope you&#39;ll enjoy your
visit.&quot; A cheer rang out and she paused to give it time to die
out, &quot;Our first act will be the lovely Lady Venus!&quot;

As Luna left the stage music began, a sweet song that soon shifted
to a rock beat. After a moment or two of anticipation she nearly ran
out from behind the curtain, her blonde hair gleaming. The dancer
wore a similar sailor suit to the waitresses and, oddly, a over
sized mask, her eyes entirely hidden from view.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Hotaru murmured, the young lady gazing up at the beautiful
woman who strode by on long and sexy legs.

Lady Venus swung around the pole gracefully, her grin saucy, then
reached up to a piece of fabric around her neck. A tug and the first
piece came free, stripping away much of the top of the costume,
revealing breasts held back by a glittering golden bikini top.

Hotaru gulped as Venus&#39; movements brought her around once again
towards her. Of course she had seen naked women before, she had the
internet, but it was very different sitting here seeing this woman
so close, sweat beading on her lightly tanned skin. `She&#39;s
gorgeous,&#39; Hotaru admitted, not even noticing as her family chatted
away.

Then Venus grabbed at the little skirt, teasing the audience as she
strutted around the stage. To the cheers of the crowd she smoothly
pulled, the white bottom and red skirt fluttering away to revealing
matching bikini bottoms to the top, hugging her sexy body.

The next ten minutes were a stunning show of barely restrained
sexuality as Venus strutted and posed, dancing as everyone drank in
her beauty. Men and woman gathered around the stage to wave money, a
few lucky ones sticking bills in her gleaming white stockings, only
the rare chosen one getting to put a bill in her bikini or panties.

`And the ones who do are only women,&#39; Hotaru found herself noting,
her breath coming quite a bit faster than usual.

&quot;Here,&quot; Haruka murmured as she pressed a bill into Hotaru&#39;s hand.

&quot;Should I?&quot; Hotaru asked, fearing being turned down.

&quot;Go for it,&quot; Michiru smiled, &quot;she&#39;s been smiling at you all evening.&quot;

Hotaru got up and moved up to the stage, watching as Venus swept
around the other side of the stage then up to hers once more.
Nervously she held the bill aloft as men and women beside her did,
feeling her heart skip a beat as Venus slowed. Stopping Venus looked
down at her, a smile teasing her lips and Hotaru realized that even
through the mask she could see her blue eyes.

Then Venus gracefully knelt, sliding close to Hotaru as if to allow
her to stick the bill in her bra. As Hotaru reached to do so Venus
took her hand, shuffling forward a bit more. &quot;I&#39;ve been hoping you&#39;d
come up all night,&quot; she murmured to Hotaru as she let the young lady
slip the bill into the edge of her bikini panties, then kissed her
gently.

&quot;Way to go,&quot; Hotaru clapped Hotaru on the back as she stumbled back
to her seat, Lady Venus waving as she left the stage.

&quot;That was... incredible,&quot; Hotaru admitted after a moment. A horrid
thought occurred to her as she asked, &quot;You didn&#39;t pay her to...?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; Haruka looked wounded.

&quot;Incoming,&quot; Setsuna warned softly.

The blonde cut through the crowd dressed in a robe, the crowd
clearing the way respectfully as she did so. Even in the simple but
comfortable blue cloth she looked lovely, her mask having been shed
somewhere back stage. She smiled as she reached their table, &quot;May I
join you?&quot;

Without really thinking about it Hotaru jumped to her feet and
offered a chair, &quot;Please do.&quot; Dragging another chair over she
noticed that her seat mates had deliberately left the only open are
beside the lovely lady. &quot;Ms Venus,&quot; Hotaru said as she sat back
down, &quot;it&#39;s a honor.&quot;

Venus smiled, her eyes remarkably warm as she met Hotaru&#39;s
eyes. &quot;Please,&quot; she nearly purred, &quot;call me Minako.&quot;</pre>
