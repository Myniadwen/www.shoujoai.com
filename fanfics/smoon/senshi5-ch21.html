<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 21 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>      The black haired girl that was dressed in the white
and red garb of a miko watched with a certain
amusement as the small man bustled about the living
room, putting up all the Christmas decorations
cheerfully. &quot;I wasn&#39;t really expecting you to go this
far,&quot; Rei Hino commented.

      Grandfather looked at her in amusement, &quot;Oh come on,
you have to admit it&#39;s fun.&quot;

      &quot;Well, yes,&quot; Rei admitted, the normally serious young
woman hanging up a wreath on the wall. She blinked in
surprise as he clambered up short the ladder, setting
a sprig of mistletoe above the doorway. Rei raised an
eyebrow, &quot;What is THAT for?&quot;

      Grandfather grinned, looking positively devilish. &quot;I
will be here long enough to say hello to them,&quot; he
explained with false innocence.

      Rei shook her head, smiling impishly. &quot;You&#39;ll be
getting kisses on the cheek, tops,&quot; she predicted with
a cheerful laugh.

      &quot;I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re doing this,&quot; he added
seriously. Grandfather smiled up at her fondly, &quot;I&#39;ve
tried to be a father to you since your mother died and
father left, but we&#39;ve had some pretty quiet Christmas
evenings together.&quot;

      &quot;And they were lovely times,&quot; Rei smiled down at him.
She looked up to gaze out at the softly falling snow,
&quot;Just like tonight, hopefully.&quot;

      Just then Makoto carried the first covered plates
into the room, the escaping scents still making both
their mouths water. &quot;Thanks for letting me use your
kitchen,&quot; the brown haired amazon smiled, her dress
swirling around her long legs. Her favorite rose
earrings glinted in the light, the expression on her
face truly happy.

      &quot;Considering you&#39;re cooking dinner for us all, you&#39;re
quite welcome,&quot; Grandfather smiled happily. Dropping
his voice he murmured, &quot;I just wish Rei could cook
that well.&quot;

      &quot;I heard that,&quot; discretely Rei elbowed him in the
ribs for that remark. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re doing
all of this for us,&quot; she added with a wry smile.

      &quot;It was my idea,&quot; Makoto shrugged, &quot;and since
everyone chipped in for the cooking supplies I thought
I should do a good job on the food.&quot; She arranged the
dishes on the table thoughtfully, &quot;I wonder when the
others will get here?&quot;

      &quot;Knowing Usagi she&#39;ll be here now that the food&#39;s
ready,&quot; Rei chuckled.

      Not too far away from the temple two figures walked
through the snow, crunching the powder beneath their
feet. &quot;I still don&#39;t see why I have to go,&quot; Luna
softly complained from her perch on Usagi&#39;s shoulder.

      &quot;Just think of it as a group bonding thing,&quot; Ami
Mizuno commented, the blue haired professor smiling
slightly. Instead of the suits that Ami usually wore
she was dressed casually, white shirt and blue skirt
along with a protective jacket. Over her shoulder she
carried her usual beg, though she had remained silent
on the contents.

      &quot;I wonder if he&#39;ll be there,&quot; Luna muttered
irritably.

      As they neared the temple they saw a sleek sports car
parked there, a familiar figure leaning up against the
still warm hood. Minako Aino&#39;s face lit up with a
smile as they walked up, the blonde haired idol
casually dressed in simple skirt and sweater.

      Artemis looked over at them tentatively, the little
white cat wincing under Luna&#39;s glare. &quot;Ah, hi,&quot; he
managed, smiling weakly.

      Luna growled, a low rumble from deep in the back of
her throat. With a sigh Usagi suddenly reached to grab
the little cat by the scruff of her neck, bringing her
around to stare into the cat&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;m declaring a
truce for tonight,&quot; she told the startled feline
firmly, &quot;there&#39;s to be no fights or sniping at each
other, got it?&quot;

      &quot;But,&quot; Luna protested.

      Dropping her voice dangerously Usagi continued
firmly, &quot;Got it?&quot;

      Luna cringed under her mistress&#39; glare. &quot;Understood,&quot;
she sighed.

      &quot;Very nice,&quot; Minako murmured, an amused smile on her
face. She fell into step beside them as they went up
the stairs, Artemis perched on her shoulder. Minako
looked over at the other two and confessed, &quot;I&#39;ve been
looking forward to this.&quot;

      &quot;Me, too,&quot; Ami admitted. She smiled slightly, tilting
her head up so that the snowflakes could settle on her
cheeks, &quot;The prospect of having a home cooked meal is
enough to fill me with joy.&quot;

      &quot;Not a cook?&quot; Usagi asked curiously.

      &quot;If it was possible to burn water,&quot; Ami said dryly,
&quot;I&#39;d probably do it.&quot;

      &quot;Seconded,&quot; Minako held up her hand sheepishly.

      Usagi echoed the gesture, &quot;Third.&quot; She smiled happily
as they reached the top of the stairs, &quot;I&#39;m just glad
it&#39;s Makoto who&#39;s cooking.&quot;

      The shrine itself was mostly deserted by now, a path
cleared through the snow towards the buildings and
other sections. Only a few people lingered, offering
prayers for the season before returning to their
homes. The door leading into the shrine itself was
open, warmth and light spilling out onto the white
dusted ground.

      &quot;Welcome,&quot; Rei looked up to greet them with a smile,
fighting back a laugh as she saw her Grandfather
waiting underneath the mistletoe. Collecting the
predicted three pecks on the cheek he excused himself,
wishing them all a merry Christmas.

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; Usagi said simply, surprising Rei with a
gentle hug.

      &quot;Hey, I&#39;m getting a great meal out of this, too,&quot; Rei
answered quietly.

      Ami looked around with a frown, her serious
expression changing to a welcoming smile as Makoto
walked inside, wiping her hands on a towel. &quot;About
time you got here,&quot; Makoto said gruffly, &quot;dinner&#39;s
just about ready.&quot;

      Luna leapt down smoothly, the slim black form
blurring slightly as she swiftly expanded. In seconds
a young woman stood there, black hair framing a lovely
face, the crescent moon glowing on her brow. &quot;Is there
anything I can do to help?&quot; Luna offered with a bow.
Artemis looked tempted to transform as well, but good
sense held him back.

      &quot;I&#39;m pretty much done,&quot; Makoto grinned, &quot;I could use
some help bringing in the rest of the dishes in a few
minutes.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ll help wash dishes,&quot; Minako offered, &quot;it&#39;s the
least I could do.&quot;

      &quot;Me, too,&quot; Usagi volunteered reluctantly.

      Dinner was dished up around the low table, everyone
talking quietly while they ate the wonderful dishes.
It was a western style meal, fitting for the western
holiday, but that merely lent an exotic air to the
meal.

      &quot;This is wonderful,&quot; Ami murmured from her seat
beside Makoto. Oddly she had moved almost as soon as
Makoto sat, taking that spot before anyone else could.

      Makoto smiled back, reaching out to retrieve a bowl
of cranberry sauce. &quot;Here, try this,&quot; she passed it
over, their fingers brushing as she did so.

      Minako watched them with a smile, pausing with a
forkful of turkey in the air then she ate it with a
smile. &quot;Don&#39;t even think about matchmaking,&quot; Artemis
muttered from where the cat sat at her side, trying
very hard not to be noticed by Luna.

      &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll need to,&quot; Minako answered with a
smile.

      &quot;So how are things at the temple?&quot; Usagi asked
curiously, looking over to where Rei sat close beside
her. Remarkably she managed to eat and talk easily,
scarfing down the turkey and potatoes seemingly
effortlessly.

      Rei watched her eat and sweatdropped. &quot;I&#39;m still
fairly busy,&quot; she admitted, &quot;people want me to do
visions for them, as well as the other duties of a
miko.&quot;

      &quot;Exorcism, wardings and other things,&quot; Usagi nodded.
At Rei&#39;s surprised look Usagi blushed, &quot;I was curious,
so I asked your grandfather.&quot;

      Once the food was done Ami surprised them with a
gift, slim wristwatches that she passed around.
&quot;They&#39;re communicators,&quot; she explained, &quot;improved
versions of the ones I gave you earlier.&quot; A slight
frown, &quot;They do have a limited range, so if one of us
leaves the city we may be out of touch.&quot;

      &quot;Green,&quot; Makoto noted the color of the wristband and
the oak leaves etched on the metal, &quot;just my color.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ami blushed faintly.

      Usagi got up to change the Christmas CD playing in
the background even as Rei went to get a drink, the
two passing by each other a moment. &quot;Look who&#39;s
standing under the mistletoe,&quot; Minako noted with a
smile, &quot;kiss!&quot;

      &quot;Kiss! Kiss!&quot; Makoto echoed even as Ami blushed
fiercely.

      Rei gave Usagi a rueful smile, &quot;You know they&#39;re
going to keep nagging us until we do.&quot;

      &quot;Best get it over with,&quot; Usagi agreed, a bit of red
to her cheeks.

      Later on, Rei would insist that all she had planned
was a simple peck on the cheek. Bending forward Usagi
had turned slightly, tilting her face up then
surprisingly lips were pressed to lips. They stood
there a second, then Usagi slid her hands up Rei&#39;s
arms for support as the kiss continued.

      &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; Rei managed breathlessly once they
separated.

      &quot;You too,&quot; Usagi answered, looking up at Rei with an
decidedly unreadable expression on her lovely face....</pre>
