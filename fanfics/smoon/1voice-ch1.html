</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A single voice shattered the stillness of the desert.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Martian  Warrior!” The language of the red planet felt as coarse and grainy to  the foreigner’s tongue as the invasive red sand, yet she projected her  voice into the oppressive heat. “Why have you strayed so far from the  field of battle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The figure she had called to in the distance  paused, but only momentarily; it was a second’s hesitation before the  small, red pony resumed its course, urged on by a white clad rider.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus-sama,”  an aide broke rank and pulled near to his leader, cautious to remain a  half pace behind his commander’s horse, “I believe she is not just a  warrior, but a Priestess of this planet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman’s blue eyes  hardened. It was the aide’s only clue to discern his leader’s thoughts,  for the customary Martian attire she wore not only shielded her face  from the harsh desert elements, but also hid her normally expressive  features from view.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had no time to react to his commander’s  whims. In a flourish, her white steed had reared onto his hind legs and  galloped forward in one fluid motion, devouring the distance that  separated himself and his rider from their target with thundering  hooves and flared nostrils.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian drew her agile stallion  to a sliding halt in front of the small, sturdy pony, and the shaggy  creature’s wild, barely tamed eyes widened as he found his passage  blocked. They were eyes that mirrored his master’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Violet eyes?’</em> Trapped in the Martian’s gaze, the Venusian’s anger slipped and she  found it hard to tap back into, though she managed well enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  are a Priestess are you not? I’m here to help you and your people.” The  woman raised a hand towards her head and was unsurprised to find the  Martian’s own dart for the hilt of her sword, passing over a bow and  arrow also strapped to her person. The foreign commander didn’t allow  this defensive reaction to alarm her. Instead, she pulled the  concealing headpiece from her face. Her long golden hair falling freely  to her waist, her upturned nose thrust into the air, it was her  confident smile that shone the brightest. “Why don’t we join forces?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess hesitated, though whether it was from the foreigner’s gesture  of friendship so brazenly displayed by the removal of her headpiece, or  the incomparable beauty that was revealed through that incredibly  trusting act, she wasn’t sure. Long moments passed slowly, the only  movements were the occasional swish of a horse’s tail and the  unrelenting heat waves that rippled across the red sands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”  The Priestess finally replied, and with a slight nudge of her left leg,  her pony turned to the right and began to plod off once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a rustle of shifting sands and the Martian was unsurprised to find the Venusian blocking her path once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you know what you’re turning down?” The woman barked, anger sparkling  in those blue eyes. How dare this little barbarian ignore her! “We can  help you in your fight against the youma!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess found  herself sighing. This was not the first diplomat to waltz onto her  planet with a romantic notion of helping a fractured nation, but in <em>this</em> woman, the Martian sensed a determination and fierceness that went far  beyond her delicate beauty, and she felt the smallest amount of  interest stir within her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know of the youma?” Her voice was raw and quiet, as though it hadn’t seen much use.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that they’ve been ravaging your planet for the past several years  and that they’re gaining in numbers, slowly wiping out your peoples. “</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And how does that matter to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Martian glared – the comment had only served to amplify her mistrust,  but the Venusian seemed to show little regret for her harsh words and  her cerulean eyes only hardened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That is, it <em>didn’t</em>.” The foreigner clarified with a deep growl. “Not until those monsters starting showing up on <em>my</em> planet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  shred of honesty and display of sheer determination seemed to have the  desired effect. This woman had a people, a planet worth protecting,  just like the Priestess herself. Finally, the Martian’s hand loosened  from the hilt of her weapon. Slowly, she returned the other woman’s  gesture and lifted her own headpiece, releasing wild, unbound raven  hair that reached the tattered leather of her pony’s saddle, and she  was not so blind not to notice the other woman openly staring at her  own appearance as much as she had discreetly admired the other’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want to know everything,” the golden haired woman demanded, “when they  first arrived, how quickly they multiplied, where they came from, what  their powers are…” she paused, her tightened fists releasing slowly  from around her steed’s weathered leather reins, “will you help me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian frowned. This woman… talked too much. She was brash, irrational…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly,  the Priestess’ pony shuddered underneath her and her hand darted to his  neck in a calming manner, though the emotion she felt was far from it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>They’re here.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  scream pierced the thick air, slicing through the dry heat, and both  women turned in its direction - to the Venusian’s traveling party. The  group of two dozen men and women were at arms; drawing swords against a  dozen youma the size of horses; huge, lumbering brown monsters with  red, beady eyes and too many teeth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red pony was halfway  across the distance that separated them when the foreigner could  finally react. Panicking, she spurred her frightened stallion forward,  chasing after the black haired woman even as the Martian dropped her  reins and slung her bow mid stride, notching an arrow and taking aim  into the midst of the traveling party through a bumpy gallop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Around  and around the battlefield the Martian galloped, notching arrows and  sending them sailing into the fray, each arrow effortlessly hitting  their marks with an unmatched accuracy. But the youma had thick skin  and size to their advantage and the Priestess’ arrows had little  effect; it took several of the projectiles to take just one of the  creatures down, and for each one she felled, another of its party took  down two of the brave Venusians.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And that’s when, with her mouth  ajar, the Priestess watched that strange, brazen woman gallop forward  on her white stallion, right into the midst of the battle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Standing  tall in her stirrups, her sword raised to the air, her golden hair  streaming behind her, the Venusian met one of the creatures head on.  Her sword caught the glint of the sun as she drew it in a wide arc and  effortlessly plunged its sharp point into the thick flesh of the  youma’s head, drawing both an unearthly scream and a spray of crimson  blood that she galloped through unflinchingly. The monster fell to the  ground with a resounding crash but two more were ready and waiting for  her on the other side of its body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then that damnable woman  jumped off her galloping horse, landing gracefully in a defensive  crouch right in between the two hulking creatures. Red eyes widened and  small arms grabbed for the Venusian’s slender frame but a sudden,  blinding light that enveloped the woman’s form pushed the youma back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  when that light cleared, the Venusian was revealed in a scant costume -  a short orange skirt, a golden band around her forehead and… high heels?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>How will she protect herself?’ </em>The  Martian felt her heart skip a beat as the youma convened on the  foreigner once more and she knew she had to act. She singled out one of  the two monsters.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her arrow made it there first, sinking into the  flesh between those two red eyes, but her pony had carried her swiftly  and her sword was right behind her preferred weapon, slicing through  the youma’s throat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And when she turned to find the woman’s  second assailant, she was surprised to find it already on the ground;  the blonde haired warrior standing over its body, a chain of golden  light tightened around its neck and the heel of that dainty orange shoe  plunged into its chest as it breathed its last in a hoarse gasp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian turned and met the observant gaze of the violet eyed Martian,  and only then did they realize that the din of the battle had ended.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian fell to her knees with the slightest of tremors to her frame,  and the same bright light that had brought her strange transformation  into fruition enveloped her once more; this time reverting her back to  her original appearance. Her eyes scanned the carnage left of the  impromptu battlefield. She was no stranger to warfare, but the sight of  her traveling party, more than half of them either maimed, dismembered,  or worse, was a tough blow for the commander to take, even as her  surviving men rose to make order of her remaining camp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  golden warrior bowed her head then, and quietly muttered a string of  words in a softly flowing tongue, a rite of death to which the Martian  quickly offered her own silent prayers. And when the foreigner looked  up once more, she had mastered back most of the tears that had  threatened to spill from her watery eyes, and was wholly surprised to  find the Martian Priestess on the ground, beside her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I regret that you’ve lost such valuable warriors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian smiled a distant smile, thankful for this small condolence,  for it seemed like much coming from the stoic woman she’d only just met.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You must have lost much to these youma as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess could only nod and avoid the Venusian’s prying gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly,  the foreign commander rose and closed the distance between herself and  the other woman. “My name is Venus Minako.” She said, even as she  noticed the Martian’s stiffening body language as she stared at the  hand she offered her. “I am Princess of Venus and leader of the senshi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Senshi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  war you have been fighting against the youma has kept your people in  the dark about many things. It is the power of my planet which I  utilize to guard Serenity, Princess of the Moon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That strange costume?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the manifestation of that power.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Armor would have been more appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  raised an eyebrow. Sarcasm? So the woman had emotions after all. “Your  skill in battle was commendable as well. I’ve never seen such accuracy  and calm calculation on the battlefield, Priestess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, the Martian met the hand offered to her in a firm shake, only to find that Minako had met her strength evenly. “Rei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei.”  The Venusian echoed, and when the Priestess saw the smile that  accompanied her name, she wondered at her quickly beating heart and  fell to the defensive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A Princess, hmm? You fight well for a <em>Princess</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s smile widened into a smirk. “Not so bad yourself, for a vagrant savage.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Hardened feet paced across finely woven rugs impatiently.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian commander, this Minako, had been out amongst the  remains of her traveling party; giving orders and reassuring her  people. Rei understood this necessity, but felt she had already  lingered long enough, and the luxurious comforts of this woman’s tent  did little to ease her need to continue her quest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?” That  gentle voice heralded the golden haired warrior, and as the tent’s  leather flap was pulled aside, letting the brightness of the afternoon  sun into the dimly lit space, the Martian blinked several times to  adjust her vision. When the sunspots faded, she found herself toe to  toe with Minako, who held a small tray of breads and meats, and two  hammered steel cups of water between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To this, the Priestess frowned. “I really need to—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nonsense.”  Minako said, and with her free hand, she wrapped her fingers around  Rei’s wrist, leading the hesitating woman to the tent’s center where  she placed the tray of food on a low table and sat at the other end.  “You aided my people and you helped me in battle. Besides, I had almost  gotten you to tell me more about the youma before… before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  sighed. To see Minako’s smile fade hurt her somehow. With a huff and a  roll of her amethyst eyes, she folded her legs beneath her and  surrendered to the comforts of the plush cushions that surrounded the  low table. Her hand darted forward and she grabbed a small loaf of  grainy bread, which she thrust into her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know the  basics.” She said between mouthfuls. “They started appearing three  years ago, attacking at random. They would appear out of nowhere and  decimate entire clans of peoples and when they were done, they would  leave no trace of their whereabouts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako set her fork down gently. “No trace at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve traveled this planet from top to bottom and not found a single camp of youma.” Rei attacked a chunk of meat, next.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No base of operations?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What of their powers?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you’d call it such, they seem to drain the life-energy from their victims before they kill them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako frowned distantly. “That’s what they do… and what do they do with that energy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian shrugged. “I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then what of their weaknesses?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  have few. Their thick skin and large size is little match for our  weapons. Our tribes are nomadic and since there’s little governing  force that binds them together, communication between them is rare.  Still, just like you and your people found out easily enough, head and  neck shots seem to be the easiest way to kill them. It is the only  tactic we can utilize.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian’s eyes softened. “And you’ve been chasing after them all these years?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  a priestess.” The Martian barked. “It’s my duty to help the people, and  my personal goal to find answers to the youma attacks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yet you seem to have hope. Where were you heading when I ran into you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The only place I’ve yet to search for the youma base,” Rei pierced Minako with cold eyes, “is the pole.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako involuntary shuddered. “The… pole?” A dark place connected to even darker legends, <em>no</em> planet had a use for their pole, and here was this woman determined to enter hers… alone. <em>‘Is she crazy?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  stood so fast that she nearly toppled the table over. Turning quickly,  she headed for the door. Her hand paused at its flap, and the warmth of  the slight sliver of sunlight it allowed didn’t reach the coldness of  her distant expression. “Everything I’ve ever cared for, I’ve lost to  them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei, wait!” Minako stumbled to her feet to chase after the retreating Priestess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  she put as much distance from the commander’s tent as possible, the  Martian bristled. She really wished the Venusian would stop saying her  name with such emotion. She spotted her pony easily enough amongst the  tall, white steeds and made a beeline for him, but she knew Minako was  hot on her heels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t be serious- you’d travel to your pole all by yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  lifted her heavy saddle from the makeshift hitching post and  effortlessly slung it onto her pony’s back and quickly cinched the  girth. “Then you already know the pole’s dangers. I do <em>not</em> encourage you to follow me, Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  stared dumbly as Rei swung her lithe body into her saddle. Without so  much as a backwards glance, the pony began a slow plod through camp,  her men moving to the side as the raven haired warrior passed through.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Martian’s hackles rose and when she turned to look behind her, the  shock she felt was enough to halt her sturdy pony beneath her; as  closing the distance, the Venusian was a sight to behold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  lack of saddle and bridle, long legs wrapped around her steed’s bare  back, and her fingers, woven through his long mane steered her towards  the retreating figure. The urgency of the action and Minako’s ensuing  words left Rei defenseless against the commander’s demands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t… don’t go alone!” Once again, she had blocked the Martian’s path.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you I came here to help you and your people. Will you wait? Just  until the morning? Our horses will be rested. We’ll be well  provisioned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even if she was hesitant to gain a traveling  partner, the Martian could not deny the logic behind the Venusian’s  plan. Narrowed eyes and a pursed brow seemed to consider the suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can even share my tent tonight!” Minako suggested leadingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snorted. “I’ll wait until morning,” she stuck her nose to the air, “but I am <em>not</em> sharing your tent.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Dim orange rays of dawn invaded the commander’s tent, and slowly, Minako’s cerulean eyes opened.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She sat up with a start.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Stumbling from her tent, still  adjusting the billowy white Martian attire around her body, the  Venusian searched her quiet camp. She was unsurprised to find Rei on  its edge, sitting atop her red pony, his nose turned towards the  southern highlands, and beyond that, the looming outline of Olympic  Mons above it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow, the Venusian couldn’t help but wonder if the Priestess had stood guard like that all night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She quickly banished the thought and hurried to tack her horse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  slight jingle of metal and creaking of leather was enough to announce  her presence, but Rei didn’t acknowledge Minako’s arrival until the  woman drew to a halt next to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m heading to a teleport  circuit. It will take us close to the pole’s center.” No words of  greeting were uttered. “Where we’re going, your desert horse will be of  little use.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a moment’s consideration, the Venusian slid  from her stallion’s side, stepped to his front and then laid an open  palm to his forehead. Dark eyes examined his master for the briefest of  moments before he silently turned and headed back for camp obediently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  pony didn’t seem to mind, but Rei stiffened as Minako slung her agile  body behind her saddle, and when two strong arms settled gently around  her waist, she wasn’t aware she’d begun to hold her breath until her  voice registered as a hoarse whisper,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would you so readily trust me, Princess of Venus?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  frowned. She’d spent the majority of the night milling over that very  question, only to find that her answer hadn’t differed from her first,  impulsive decision to follow Rei to whatever dangers awaited them at  Mars’ pole.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I would, Priestess of Mars.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
On the pole, winter was breaking.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Sun tentatively hung low to the horizon. Phobos was a small  point of irregularly shaped light creeping into the western sky, but it  was the clouds of frost driven by harsh, howling winds that heralded  the change in season.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s teeth chattered in Rei’s ear. A  large, furry animal skin was draped across both their bodies, and even  the stoic Martian had since ceased her nervous fidgeting at the  Venusian’s proximity; for their shared body heat was all too welcome in  this bitter climate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly, Rei pulled back on the reins and  the pony came to a hesitant stop. They stood still for a moment, and  the driving frost began to accumulate on the pony’s red forelock and he  stamped a foot impatiently. Finally, the Priestess nudged him with her  right foot and urged him to the left.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?” Minako asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re close.” The Martian said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How do you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I sense it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian rested her chin on the Priestess’ shoulder. “Sense?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I may not have… <em>senshi</em> powers, but I do have certain abilities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.”  Minako said more to herself, for the Martian was clearly not willing to  discuss the matter further. Silently, they rode on, until they nearly  crested a rocky hill.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pony stopped once more, but this time,  the Martian slipped from the arms of the Venusian to dismount. Like an  animal stalking prey, Rei lowered her center of gravity to her haunches  and crept the rest of the way up the rise, hiding her body behind a  massive rock at its top.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Crouching behind the same rock, Minako  was quick to join her, hurriedly tossing the warm fur back over both of  their bodies, but Rei didn’t seem to notice this thoughtful gesture.  Instead, her cold, violet eyes were trained on the snow-strewn valley  below. The Venusian’s eyes widened in response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There were  hundreds… thousands of youma! Oblivious to the biting winds and driving  frost, they were all milling around a central point… and their numbers  were growing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An access point!” Minako exclaimed, finding the  metal contraption from where the creatures seemed to spawn. “They’re  invading from another planet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Invasion?” The Martian asked slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  face only hardened, and for a brief moment, Minako worried that the  barbarian would fling herself into the youmas’ midst; one woman  equipped with a bow and a sword against a few thousand monsters. And  though she envied the Martian her bravery, she found herself wrapping  her arms around the other woman even tighter, just in case.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The answer you seek is not on Mars, Rei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  calm voice served its purpose and the battle readiness the Martian had  felt faded significantly; she couldn’t help but feel robbed. Although  she hadn’t known what to expect to find on the pole, she hadn’t  expected to find more questions instead of answers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bonelessly,  she fell to her knees, barely aware of the warm presence that had  followed her descent with warm arms and protective blanket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is no longer your battle, alone, Priestess.” Minako’s voice was almost harsh in her ears. “Come to the Moon with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Moon?” Rei asked detachedly, her eyes still locked on the youma in the valley.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Queen  Serenity, the Princess, they need to know what we’ve found here. My  comrades, the Princesses of Jupiter and Mercury, have been researching  the youma as well. You’d be a great asset to our cause.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei merely snorted and Minako frowned at her response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  have more collective knowledge of the enemy than all of us combined.  And even though you’re no senshi, your skill in battle would be useful,  along with your sensing abilities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ch’.” The Martian cursed,  her eyes narrowing on the monsters pouring through the access point,  invading her home from some foreign location.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s voice  deepened. “If you truly want to help your people, and if you truly want  revenge against the youma, then come with me, Rei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian  turned to meet the Venusian’s confident gaze, and in those cerulean  eyes, she could see why the woman was named leader of so powerful a  force. It was rare for the Martian to meet one as dominant and driven  as herself, and though she didn’t plan on calling this woman her leader  as others might, she found it surprisingly easy to fall into step  behind Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll join you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The hesitant Priestess was met with a cocky grin. “Would you so readily trust me, Priestess of Mars?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  frowned. She wouldn’t have trusted a battle tested tactician or a  wizened advisor after several years of serving alongside them. Yet  somehow… somehow… she found herself meeting that grin with one of her  own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I would, Princess of Venus.”</span></p>

Author’s Notes:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I know what you’re thinking. Oh no, another Silver Millennium fic, I  know exactly how this is going to end! But remember, this is an  Alternative Universe, so stick with it! The Titanic just might not hit  that particular iceberg… although I can’t promise that it might not hit  others.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For those of you who have followed me from past fics, A  Single Voice will be a bit of a departure from my regular style. A  little less descriptive, a little more plot and dialogue driven, but I  hope I will continue to please. </span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 2: Together</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Queen Serenity, Princess Serenity, this is Rei, and-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  stepped away from Minako and locked gazes with the Queen and the  Princess. “And I am a Priestess of Mars.” The Martian declared this  boldly, and she could feel the Venusian fuming beside her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t tell me you could speak Common!” Minako snapped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei regarded Minako with cool eyes. “You never asked. I may be of a <em>barbarian</em> people, but I am not uneducated, <em>Princess</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian nearly growled. Payback, after all, was a bitch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  melodic laugh broke the room’s tension and the younger of the two  women, the Princess, rose from her throne. She descended the steps in a  slow and measured gait until the last step, on which the long hem of  her white gown lodged under her delicate shoe, sending the woman  sprawling towards the floor, her arms pinwheeling and long golden  pigtails streaming out behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was the quickest of those  that lunged forward, and without thinking, she soon found a teary eyed  Princess Serenity in her arms. Watery, cobalt eyes peered up at her and  the Martian couldn’t help but notice the young woman’s petite frame and  apparent fragility. A slight blush dusting her cheeks, the Priestess  righted the heir to the Moon Kingdom and shrugged off her clinging  embrace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That seemed to break the spell, and big, round crocodile  tears began spilling down the Princess’ face. “I’m sorry! “ She wailed.  “You’re just so beautiful, I had to get a closer look!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Frowning,  the Martian stiffened and backed up slightly, only to find herself  surrounded. Minako stood at her back, and behind her, two other women  stood at the ready; one was exceptionally tall with long brown hair  tied into a pony tail, and another with loose, short blue hair; both  had observant eyes trained on not the Princess, but on Rei. The Martian  forced herself to relax her posture, for she could sense their mistrust  and she was very aware that if she had to fight over an apparent  misunderstanding, she was terribly outnumbered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And only then did she realize that the Princess had never stopped her animated gushing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne,  Ami-chan? Mako-chan? Minako-chan? I can feel it.” Serenity’s voice was  a whisper as she approached Rei once more. A steady hand reached  forward and touched the flinching Martian’s cheek softly. “We’re all  together now.”</span></p>
