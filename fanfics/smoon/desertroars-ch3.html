<h1>And the Desert Roars (part 3 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arashi.html">arashi-enkou</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/desertroars-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Setsuna rubbed her temples and walked slowly down the halls. Boy, what a 
night this had been. First, her princess had admitted to...prefering the 
company of women. There wasn&#39;t anything wrong with that, of course, but 
her interest had lay in the form of the raven-haired warrior from the 
desert, Rei. A warrior that was also serving as the princess&#39;s personal 
bodyguard. As if this wasn&#39;t enough, a few minutes ago she had learned 
that her princess had allowed herself to be de-flowered by a total 
stranger! Of course, Rei was no longer a stranger afterwards, but it was 
the sheer thought of it that made the sorceress&#39;s head throb and her 
heart ache with motherly worry.

Now the green-haired woman was faced with a set of choices; tell Pharoh 
Endyimon and seal Rei&#39;s fate, or keep it a secret and allow Rei to fight 
and then perish underneath the strength of Pharoh Endyimon&#39;s armies.

By Ra this was difficult.

&#39;A woman of my age should not be pressured like this,&#39; she thought 
wearily in her mind. Quite suddenly, a vison invaded her mind, so sharp 
and vivid it made her stiffen.

Golden hair cascaded over her shoulders.

Eyes as blue as the sapphires in the royal treasure chamber.

A body seemingly carved out of stone.

And an arrow pointed at her heart.

&quot;Tonight you die sorceress,&quot; the yellow haired goddess growled. &quot;This I 
vow.&quot; Setsuna&#39;s face never changed. &quot;Well?&quot; the blonde barked. &quot;Aren&#39;t 
you going to scream?! Cry out for help?! Be my guest; I&#39;m itching for a 
good scuffle.&quot;

&quot;If you wish to kill me do so. Now. &quot;The blonde snarled and released the 
arrow.

Then the vision shifted to another...

&quot;Setsuna,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Gods, I love you. I love you...&quot; Setsuna 
smiled amongst her tears.

&quot;Say it again,&quot; she pleaded against silky wheat colored hair. &quot;say it 
once more for me?&quot;

&quot;I love you Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;I love you too Min--&quot;

The creak of a bow surfaced her from the vision. Setsuna steeled her 
face and slowly turned.

It was the woman from the vision.

Golden hair cascaded over her shoulders.

Eyes as blue as the sapphires in the royal treasure chamber.

A body seemingly carved out of stone.

And an arrow pointed at her heart.

&#39;Ah,&#39; Setsuna thought with a small smile. &#39;This is how it ends then? 
Pity. I really wanted to say good-bye to Usagi.&#39;

Minako was expecting a whithered old man when she climbed through the 
window of the palace. Or at least a priest that had been so rightous in 
his lief, the gods would grant him the gift of the second sight.

She never expected to see a flesh-and-blood goddess there.

The woman had lonng, slender legs that seemed as long as the Nile 
herself. Moccha colored skin was covered in a sheer fabirc that flowed, 
more erotic than modest. Green hair, smooth and silky drifted down to 
mid-back. And her eyes...

&#39;Are they the eyes of a demon?&#39;

Garnet eyes, slightly slanted at the edges to accent the genlte hollows 
of her face, stared at her own blue eyes.

&#39;No...they&#39;re too beautiful to be a demon&#39;s...&#39;

It was such a pity that Minako had been given orders to slay the 
sorcerer. Or, sorceress to be exact. Such was the life of an assasin.

&quot;Tonight you die sorceress,&quot; she made herself growl. Leveling the bow at 
the sorceress&#39;s heart, she made her voice harden. &quot;This I vow.&quot; The 
woman&#39;s face never changed. They stayed like that, simply staring each 
other down. A test of wills.

Never being the one to listen to, &#39;Patience is a virtue&#39;, Minako drew 
the bowstring taunt and barked out, &quot;Well?! Aren&#39;t you going to scream?! 
Cry out for help?!&quot; She chuckled darkly. &quot;Be my guest; I&#39;m itching for a 
good scuffle.&quot;

&quot;If you are going to kill me, do so. Now.&quot;

Setsuna was ready. She had lived long enough. She had seen enough. She 
was going to embrace death with open arms.

Death came in the form of a golden haired goddes.

The bow seemed to tremble for a small moment. Then, the assasin snarled 
and realeased the arrow. Setsuna closed her eyes and waited for the 
arrow to penetrate her chest.

It never did.

Instead, she felt the breeze as the arrow missed its mark and buried 
itself in the stone walls.

Setsuna blinked open her eyes and was very surprised to see her 
executioner staring her right in the face, only inches from her lips. 
Their breaths intermingled; their hearts pounded together.

It was magical; it was erotic; it was amusingly romantic.

&quot;One taste,&quot; the blonde murmured as she ran the pad of her thumb over 
Setsuna&#39;s lips. &quot;I just need one taste,&quot; the green haired sorceress felt 
the cold steel of a dagger press against the small of her back. &quot;before 
I send you to the afterlife.&quot;

&#39;As do I...&#39; Setsuna whispered in her mind as the assasin closed the 
minor distance between them.

Minako groaned. Oh...Gods

A kiss had never been this...electric before. White hot lightning raced 
from her lips and traveled to her toes, then back to her lips. There was 
a dull clatter as the dagger hit the floor. She wrapped her arms around 
the sorceress, fisted a hand in that wealth of green hair, and tipped it 
back. She opened her mouth, just a bit and swept her toungue across the 
moccha colored goddess&#39;s lips.

There was a pause.

Then, with a sexy sigh, the green-haird beauty&#39;s lips opened 
and...Gods!!

Minako moaned again and pinned the woman to the wall.

When the sorceress&#39;s arms wrapped around her neck to hold her there, 
Minako knew that one taste would never be enough.</pre>
