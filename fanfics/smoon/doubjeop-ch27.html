<h1>Double Jeopardy (part 27 of 28)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/neuro.html">Neuroleptic</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/doubjeop-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>Of Apples and Oranges

Kneeling in a puddle of rain-slicked blood, Sailor Mercury tightly clung 
to Makoto&#39;s body. She shook her head while burying her face in Makoto&#39;s 
shoulder. Nothing else mattered at this point to her. Besides, with the 
odds stacked so heavily against her, there just wasn&#39;t any reason to 
fight back at this point anyway.

Trista stepped forward and placed a hand on Ami&#39;s shoulder tightly, 
ready to rip her away from her trophy, but Ami was able to yank her 
shoulder out of her grip, still holding onto her dead lover.

Dark Saturn said, &quot;You weak fool! Stand and defend yourself!&quot;

&quot;Give her a moment, for pity&#39;s sake!&quot;

Trista pointed her glaive in warning at Amy, then said, &quot;You want a go, 
little girl?&quot;

Amy stepped forward and said, &quot;She is suffering. It is not right.&quot;

Trista laughed, then said, &quot;She is an enemy to the throne, and must be 
dealt with. Besides, since when did you care about how any of them felt? 
I hear you electrocuted this one just for sport.&quot;

Amy narrowed her eyes at the taller woman, then said, &quot;It was the most 
efficient way of making her talk. Don&#39;t you dare judge me for what I had 
to--&quot;

Mina put her hand on the bluenette&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;That&#39;s enough, 
Amy.&quot; Then to Dark Saturn she said, &quot;Trista? I thought the plan was to 
kill them one by one.&quot;

Trista looked past Ami, and into Makoto&#39;s lifeless gaze. Even in death, 
the woman appeared to have courage and strength. &quot;We can kill three of 
them right here, right now.&quot; Glaring at Amy, she said, &quot;It&#39;s the logical 
thing to do.&quot;

Thinking quickly, Dark Venus said, &quot;Leaving these two alive would work 
to our advantage.&quot;

Dark Saturn said, &quot;If you know what is best for you, you will not step 
outside of your new lesser role. If you think you can convince me 
that--&quot;

Mina stepped forward, speaking rapidly, &quot;Killing them one by one will 
demoralize them. With every victory, we would gain strength while theirs 
will leave them. It may take longer, but it is a far more efficient 
means of defeating our enemies.&quot;

Trista tilted her head, saying, &quot;Yes, I know. That was the original 
plan. But you saw this one yourself. If she is any indication, they are 
far stronger than we anticipated. It is dangerous to risk letting even 
one of them live, even for a matter of moments. Especially when such a 
perfect opportunity to eliminate many of them presently exists.&quot;

Dark Venus had now moved so she was standing between Ami and Trista. She 
looked right into the woman&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;What you call strength, I 
call desperation. Go ahead and kill her if it pleases you, but at the 
very least, you know it won&#39;t be as thrilling for you this way.&quot; That 
was the major difference between Mina and the rest of the Sekkou, and 
what had allowed her to lead them for so long. She could read people.

And if there was one thing she knew about Trista, it was that she lived 
to watch the life leave her victim&#39;s eyes.

Dark Saturn looked down at Ami in thought, then lowered her weapon 
slowly and stepped away. &quot;Enough of this. We must show Beryl proof that 
we are worthy of carrying out her orders. This lone dead Senshi is more 
than enough of a trophy. We shall leave these two so that they might 
amuse us more in the future.&quot;

Then she said to Amy and Mina, &quot;Prove your loyalty to me, and retrieve 
the body.&quot;

Mina held up a hand, stopping Amy. &quot;No, I&#39;ll do it. It&#39;s my 
responsibility alone.&quot;

She knelt down beside Sailor Mercury and said softly, &quot;She&#39;s gone, Ami. 
You can&#39;t follow her where she is now.&quot; Mina put a reassuring hand on 
her shoulder and continued, &quot;Let her go. It will be easier this--&quot;

Ami finally lifted her head, looking right into Mina&#39;s eyes. In that 
moment, the Sekkou knew there was something that had died within the 
woman. And it had been replaced by intense pain and hopelessness. Ami 
didn&#39;t need to say anything for Dark Venus to know she would never let 
go of Makoto willingly.

Then without letting go of Makoto&#39;s body, Ami punched Mina as hard as 
she could manage.

Mina rubbed her cheek gently, and was glad for the fact that this Senshi 
wasn&#39;t physically any stronger.&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ami, but this is for the 
best.&quot; Mina took a step back, then delivered a hard kick to the side of 
Ami&#39;s head, sending her sprawling on her back into the mud.

Mina gave one last longing look at Rei&#39;s unconscious form, then beckoned 
for Amy to help her lift Makoto&#39;s body.

As the two of them started to lift the corpse, Ami groaned, then pushed 
herself to her feet, trying to look as defiant as she could, staggering 
toward them to make one last attempt to reclaim Makoto&#39;s body.

Dark Saturn stepped in front of Ami as she said &quot;You Senshi just don&#39;t 
give up, do you?&quot; Then she nodded her head, saying, &quot;Take care of my 
light work.&quot;

Ray and Lita had moved so that they were now standing behind Ami. 
Without so much as a thought, Dark Mars delivered a well placed punch to 
her back, sending Ami to her knees. Then Dark Jupiter gave Ami a sharp 
kick to the gut before stepping over her to join the others.

Dark Neptune activated her pendant, and as Ami watched from her place on 
the ground, the Sekkou left, taking Makoto&#39;s body with them.

The first thing Rei was aware of was a splitting headache.

Opening her eyes didn&#39;t help anything either.

Once her senses started to return to her, she realized she was laying in 
a bed . As Rei touched her head in an attempt to ward off the pain, she 
noticed that someone had carefully wrapped the top of her head with 
gauze. Then she remembered what, in her mind, had just happened.

&quot;Mina!&quot;, Rei yelled as she sat up quickly. She immediately regretted the 
action as a wave of nausea overtook her, and found herself slumping back 
to her pillow.

Rei groaned loudly, as she pressed her fingers against her head, saying, 
&quot;This feels far worse than any hangover I have ever had.&quot;

She started to stand, and felt a hand reach out and grab hers, helping 
her to her feet. Rei&#39;s head started to spin as her eyes lost focus for a 
moment. A pair of slender arms wrapped around her waist, supporting her.

Minako said gently, &quot;Hey, take it easy. You took a nasty blow to the 
head.&quot;

With Minako&#39;s help, Rei staggered over to a chair. Once Rei was sure she 
wouldn&#39;t fall out of her seat, she asked, &quot;Where&#39;s Mako-chan and 
Ami-chan?&quot;

Minako knelt in front of Rei and stammered, &quot;Rei, you . . . just need to 
relax for a minute. Ami says you could have a concu--&quot;

Rei held up a hand and said, &quot;You know better than to mess with a woman 
with a migraine, Minako-chan. I&#39;ll heal. Ami was doing pretty bad last 
thing I remembered, and Makoto . . . how bad is it?&quot;

The blonde looked down at her hands the moment Rei started talking, but 
even then, she had seen just enough of Minako&#39;s eyes to know that she 
was crying. Minako said between sobs, &quot;I tried Rei . . . we . . . all 
did. It&#39;s just . . . Tokyo&#39;s such a . . . big city, and traffic . . . 
getting away from our jobs . . . and . . .and . . .&quot;

Minako stopped talking a moment, as she sucked in air, trying to force 
herself to calm down. &quot;Makoto . . .Makoto is. . .&quot; She closed her hands 
into fists, then managed to gasp out, &quot;She&#39;s dead, Rei. Makoto&#39;s dead.&quot;

Rei shook her head in disbelief. &quot;No . . . She was holding her own. She 
. . .&quot;

Still looking at her fists, Minako continued, &quot;Ami&#39;s distraught. She 
blames herself.&quot;

Still numb, Rei moved down to the floor and pulled Minako close while 
saying, &quot;I&#39;m sure she did her best. If anything it&#39;s my--&quot;

Rei could feel Minako&#39;s tears starting to dampen her shoulder as Minako 
said softly, &quot;No, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s my fault, Rei. I didn&#39;t even get there 
until . . . maybe 20 minutes after it was . . . over. Ami . . . she was 
covered in blood. I thought it was yours at first, since she was trying 
to drag you away by herself . . . She was totally alone . . .&quot; After 
that, Minako just couldn&#39;t talk anymore.

Finally, Rei could feel her own tears starting to run down her cheeks. 
She held Minako close to her as she whispered, &quot;It was no one&#39;s fault, 
Minako. Like you said, we all did our best.&quot; Rei shrugged weakly as the 
full implications of what had happened finally hit her, and finished by 
saying, &quot;Fate just . . . wasn&#39;t on our side today.&quot;

Ami ran a hand through her still-damp hair, then hunched back over the 
apartment&#39;s small dining room table to hide her face. It was the only 
movement in the room for several minutes.

Aside for his wife, Mamoru considered himself closest to Ami out of the 
Senshi. One of the things he admired Ami for was her ability to control 
her emotions, and to think logically in any situation. For him, seeing 
her unable to do both was even worse than learning of Makoto&#39;s fate.

Moving closer, he said, &quot;Ami . . .&quot; Then he stopped. He was about to say 
that Makoto wouldn&#39;t have wanted her to be like this, but that was as 
far as he managed to get. Somehow, he didn&#39;t feel it was enough. Instead 
he placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder for a moment, then stepped 
back. Sometimes, all one could do was be there for a person.

Usagi sat across from Ami, wiping her own tears from her cheeks. Finally 
she said, &quot;I know you&#39;re hurt, Ami, we all are. But you need to talk to 
us.&quot; She tried to smile as she said, &quot;Don&#39;t you always tell Rei that 
bottling up her emotions is a bad thing?&quot;


Ami said, &quot;No . . . Usagi-chan, I could have saved her. There had to be 
a way. All I had to do was--&quot;

Mamoru interrupted her, saying, &quot;Ami-chan, you&#39;re being too hard on 
yourself. You did your best. Makoto would be proud of you.&quot;

Still not looking up, Ami shook her head. &quot;No! You don&#39;t understand. I 
was . . . Mamo-chan . . . I didn&#39;t even try to fight. I just . . . I did 
. . . what I did last time. I just . . . I gave up. What if I could have 
gotten Makoto away? What if I had been able to revive her? What if--&quot;

Usagi said, &quot;Ami . . . I know my math skills aren&#39;t good but . . . even 
I know nine against one wouldn&#39;t have been a fair fight.&quot;

Ami clenched her hands into fists, then, without looking up said, &quot;I 
just . . . I don&#39;t get it.&quot;

Mamoru and Usagi looked at each other, then back at Ami. That was the 
first time they could ever remember her saying that.

Ami unclenched her hands, saying, &quot;I must have done something wrong. I 
should have anticipated that they would try to ambush Makoto today. It 
was such an obvious thing for them to have done . . . I should have gone 
to you all earlier and . . .&quot;

Ami&#39;s voice trailed off as she said softly to herself, &quot;No . . . wait . 
. . that&#39;s not possible.&quot;

Mamoru said, &quot;Ami, you need to listen to us. It was not your fault. 
There wasn&#39;t anything you could have done by yourself. You gave it your 
all. Regardless of how all of us feel, you can&#39;t blame yourself for 
this, and we aren&#39;t going to let you.&quot;

Ami finally raised her head as she pushed her chair back, then looked at 
the two of them for a moment. She had stopped crying, but the lost 
expression she wore seemed even more out of place. &quot;No! You do not 
understand. I . . . I don&#39;t get it. When we went into the future, she 
was still alive thousands of years from now. I saw it myself. So did 
you.&quot;

Usagi interrupted her, saying carefully, &quot;Ami . . . this isn&#39;t a math 
problem that you can just figure your way out of. There wasn&#39;t a right 
or wrong answer. You need to sto--&quot;

Ami shook her head, then put her glasses back on as she tried to regain 
control of her emotions, saying frantically, &quot;No, not math, physics!&quot;

Usagi sat back up in her chair and said, &quot;Uh . . . did I miss 
something?&quot;

Ami&#39;s eyes lost focus as she looked through Usagi at some unseen 
formula. Then she looked at Mamoru and said, sounding just a bit 
uncertain, &quot;Novikov&#39;s Self Consistency Principle?&quot;

Usagi blinked her eyes in confusion, then looked at Ami as if she had 
finally cracked. &quot; Uh . . . Ami, that&#39;s kinda out of the blue, isn&#39;t it? 
I can&#39;t even pronounce that . . . Nike&#39;s self continent principal? 
What&#39;s that?&quot;

Mamoru looked at Ami, shook his head sadly and said, &quot;You know that&#39;s 
only a theory, Ami. There&#39;s just as much chance that Polchinski&#39;s 
Paradox is possible. I just . . . I don&#39;t know if this is something you 
want to place your heart on, Ami.&quot;

Ami shook her head, as tears started to run down her cheeks, but at the 
same time, she started to smile. She looked at Usagi, and said, &quot;But if 
I am correct . . . We know that various solutions to theory of general 
relativity allow closed time like curves such as Goldel Metr-- . . .&quot; 
Seeing Usagi&#39;s eyes start to spin, Ami said, &quot;No wait, let me start 
over.&quot;

Ami started pacing around Usagi and Mamoru, then she went over to the 
counter and picked an apple out of the fruit basket. &quot;Ok . . . if . . . 
no . . . that is not right. Setsuna has proven that time travel is 
possible. So . . . since time travel is possible, in theory if I throw 
this apple through a worm hole that has an opening that is located 
approximately three seconds into the future at just the right angle, it 
should be able to strike itself, thus preventing the apple from going 
into the future.&quot;

Usagi nodded dumbly, then said, &quot;Uh . . .ok?&quot;

&quot;That is what Mamoru is talking about. That&#39;s Polchinski&#39;s Paradox. 
However, because of Novikov&#39;s Self Consistency Principle, the apple 
comes through at a different angle, not the same one. So, the apple 
still strikes itself in the past, but it knocks it in such a way that it 
alters its trajectory so that it winds up being the cause of what sends 
it through the worm hole.&quot;

Ami continued, &quot;Or, the apple comes through at the same angle, hitting 
the apple that came through so that instead of the apple I threw, the 
apple that exited the worm hole ricochets off of the one I threw and it 
enters the worm hole that takes it into the future instead, thus 
knocking itself back through time so that it still strikes itself in 
such a way that it penetrates the future. Thus, the apple will always go 
into the future when I throw it, no matter how I throw it, or how it 
comes out of the worm hole three seconds into the future. The apple will 
always get to the worm hole to get into the future.

Usagi got up, and shook Ami&#39;s shoulders, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you just 
said, but that&#39;s crazy talk, Ami-chan . . . and besides, you&#39;re not an 
apple . . .&quot;

Mamoru nodded, then said, &quot;Usagi&#39;s right.&quot;

Usagi said dumbly, &quot;I am?&quot;

Mamoru sighed, then said, &quot;Yes. Ami, what Usagi is saying is, we don&#39;t 
want to see you get hurt by putting your hopes up. Plus, even if the 
theories are correct, then you also should know that we need to factor 
in parallel universes, an orange being tossed at your apple by me, if 
you will, into your equation. Now that we are aware of there existence, 
we have to acknowledge that there is always the chance that you are 
wrong about the . . . uh well, your apple. The amount of variables to 
consider are so extreme that--&quot;

Ami shook her head, as hope began to fill her voice. &quot;No! Mamoru, . . . 
Usagi . . . the apple, destiny, fate, what have you. I am saying you can 
not change the future. Well . . . you might be able to do minor changes 
. . . but the outcome will always be the same. So Makoto can&#39;t be . . . 
and if she&#39;s not then . . . but even if she is . . .&quot;

Usagi looked worried as she said, &quot;Yeah, Ami-chan, we need to think 
about Mamoru&#39;s idea too. We have to think about the . . . uh . . . idea? 
. . . Fact? That there is a bad apple . . . or an orange . . . or 
something being thrown and . . . not that there&#39;s anything wrong with 
your apple! I mean . . . it&#39;s such a nice red apple. It&#39;s . . . It&#39;s 
just . . . well . . . uh . . .&quot; The blonde turned to her husband and 
said, &quot;Well, you explain it to her!&quot;

Mamoru said to both of them, &quot;Either way, it means we have a serious 
problem on our hands.&quot;

Queen Beryl stood in the shadows, waiting patiently. She knew her 
minions had returned, and was eager to hear what message they had to 
deliver. Either way, she felt it would prove . . . entertaining to her.

The door to her chamber opened, and Trista strolled confidently up to 
Beryl, then knelt before her queen. Holding both of her hands out 
dramatically, she presented her lady with a chrome serving tray.

Standing beside Beryl was her new guard, Dark Sailor Moon. The woman 
glared at the intruder, then demanded, &quot;What is the meaning of this.&quot;

Dark Saturn stepped aside, then commanded, &quot;Bring her in.&quot;

The rest of the Sekkou entered the room. The first two, Rei and Lita, 
carried Makoto&#39;s body. Once they reached their queen, they tossed her at 
Beryl&#39;s feet, then once again, formed a line before their queen, 
patiently waiting to hear what she would say.

Beryl stepped back from the corpse nervously, then looked at Trista. 
Forcing herself to become calm, she asked, &quot;Is she dead?&quot;

Trista nodded, then glanced at Dark Moon as she said, &quot;Unlike 
someamongst us, I would never allow a living Senshi to get near our 
beloved queen.&quot;

The queen glared down at the remains, then said to Serena, &quot;Ensure that 
it is so.&quot;

Dark Moon walked over to Dark Saturn, held out her hand, motioning for 
the other Sekkou to give her the Silent Glaive.

Dark Saturn narrowed her eyes at the woman, but did as was requested of 
her.

Serena turned, then kicked Makoto&#39;s body so that she rolled onto her 
back. Sunken unseeing eyes gazed up at the ceiling, and her slack jaw 
lay open as if yawning.

Serena said sarcastically, &quot;Well . . . she certainly looks dead, but one 
can never be too sure, can they?&quot;

She gently tapped Makoto&#39;s side a few times with her foot. Then, in a 
fit of unprovoked rage, Dark Moon stomped on the dead woman&#39;s chest, 
causing what little remained of Makoto&#39;s breath to escape in a soft, 
lifeless gasp.

Then she stabbed the blade deep into Makoto&#39;s stomach. With the 
exception of herself and Trista, the rest of the Sekkou either closed 
their eyes for a few moments, or turned their heads away. This had long 
since passed barbaric, even for them.

Trista looked at her queen, then said, &quot;Satisfied?&quot; She didn&#39;t bother to 
hide her frustration with the situation. Being robbed of her victory by 
one who had essentially done nothing infuriated her beyond words. But 
one did not say such things to a queen with as much power as Beryl.

Rather than responding, Beryl lifted her Ginzuishou, incinerating 
Makoto&#39;s battered body with the wave of her hand. As with the Sekkou, a 
small ball of light emerged. But Makoto&#39;s was different.

The spirit of Makoto Kino glowed with a brilliance far brighter and 
vivid than any of the Sekkou&#39;s had. It also had a slight green tint to 
the light that radiated from it. Her spirit brought light to every 
corner of the room, virtually smothering out the shadows. Her spirit was 
proud and strong. And it resisted Beryl&#39;s power.

Beryl glared angrily at this strange powerful being. &quot;How dare you defy 
me.&quot; Then, with the flick of her wrist, darkness returned to the 
farthest reaches of the room, slowly starting to twist and weave it&#39;s 
way around the glow of Makoto&#39;s spirit. Slowly smothering the light. 
While Makoto wasn&#39;t able to push back, she was able to slow it.

The spirit flashed for a few seconds, sending sparks of electricity 
arching around the speck of light.

The queen growled, &quot;I think not, you fool!&quot;

More sparks flew from the ball of light, as Beryl tilted her head 
slightly to the side, listening to an unheard voice. Whatever was said, 
caused anger to flash in Beryl&#39;s eyes.

Beryl clenched her teeth together for a moment. Then she said back, &quot;She 
cannot save you. No one can save you. You are mine now.&quot;

Then, as Beryl gripped the Ginzuishou tighter in her hands in 
frustration, the shadows of the room swirled around the green light, 
causing it&#39;s glow to soften considerably, and in it&#39;s own way, 
violently. There was one last bright flash from the light in protest, 
then it was wrapped in a darkness that allowed only the smallest amount 
of light to radiate from it.

Beryl motioned to Makoto&#39;s spirit. Crushed and cloaked in shadow, it 
obediently hovered over the queens open hand. Queen Beryl whispered, 
&quot;You see, I can break your kind. Mold you into whatever I want. Your 
power and stubbornness will make you the perfect killing machine, my new 
pet.&quot;

Then, she tossed her prize into the ashes, and watched as bright light 
formed around the pile, slowly forcing it to take shape.

She had Makoto&#39;s body, but one could tell by looking into her eyes that 
she possessed little of her own soul. Like the other Sekkou, Makoto&#39;s 
leotard was now black, and her tiara titanium instead of gold. The cloth 
that had once been a vibrant green, was now white. Beside her lay a long 
black javelin.

Makoto&#39;s new body lay on the ground motionless for a moment before 
taking her first, loud greedy gasp for air.

Beryl said almost mockingly, &quot;Rise, Dark Sailor Europa, and abandon all 
hope. For you, it is forsaken.&quot;

Wordlessly and obediently, Dark Europa picked up her javelin and got to 
her feet.
