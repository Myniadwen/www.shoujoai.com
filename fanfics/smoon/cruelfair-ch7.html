<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 7 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crawlspace.html">Crawlspace</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>	The door to the waiting room opened, causing Chisa to look up 
from her computer.  &#147;Afternoon, Kaya,&#148; she said cheerfully as the other 
woman came into the office.  &#147;He&#146;s with a patient.  He should only be a 
few more minutes.&#148;
	&#147;Thanks, Chisa,&#148; answered Kaya.  She took a seat and picked up 
one of the magazines from the coffee table.  As she flipped through the 
pages, Kaya laughed to herself.  Some of these magazines made taking 
care of a baby seem unbelievably complicated.  As far as Kaya was 
concerned, after nine months of pregnancy hell and two days of labor, 
taking the baby home was the easy part.
	Fifteen minutes had passed when Ken walked out behind his patient.  
The poor woman looked like she had swallowed a beach ball.
	&#147;She looks like she&#146;s about to pop,&#148; commented Kaya after the 
woman had left.
	&#147;She is,&#148; answered Ken.  &#147;I give it a week, tops.&#148;  He motioned 
for Kaya to follow him back to his office.  &#147;Do you have time for lunch?  
My next appointment isn&#146;t until two.&#148;
	Kaya shook her head.  &#147;Sorry, can&#146;t.  But I was hoping you would 
do me a favor.&#148;  She perched on the edge of the desk as she reached 
into her bag.  Kaya pulled out a box of lollipops and handed it to Ken.  
&#147;I swiped these from oncology.  When Makoto comes in this afternoon, 
give them to her.  Tell her they&#146;re a free sample or something.  The 
number to order more is on the side of the box.&#148;
	Ken chuckled.  &#147;Stealing candy from cancer patients.  There has 
got to be something unethical about that, Doctor.&#148;
	&#147;Oh, please,&#148; said Kaya with a wave of her hand.  &#147;They&#146;ve got 
cartons of them.  They won&#146;t miss one little box.  Besides, this girl 
is just as needy.&#148;  She frowned in remembered sympathy.  &#147;Ami had her 
over to the house a few weeks ago, and I thought the poor thing was 
going to have to move into my bathroom.&#148;
	Ken made a mental note to ask Makoto about the morning sickness 
and double check her dietary habits.  Then he asked, &#147;Why not have Ami 
give them to her?&#148;
	&#147;Because I already sent some over with Ami,&#148; explained Kaya.  
&#147;She mentioned that Makoto liked them, but if I give her any more it 
will seem like I&#146;m being too familiar with the girl.&#148;
	Ken knew he would love this woman for the rest of his life, but 
he doubted he would ever understand her.  &#147;You don&#146;t want to seem too 
familiar with her, yet you found her a doctor, had your daughter force 
her into an appointment, and now you&#146;re keeping tabs on her checkups.  
I think I&#146;ve missed something here.&#148;
	&#147;Don&#146;t get smart,&#148; replied Kaya.  &#147;Anyway, it isn&#146;t Makoto I&#146;m 
keeping tabs on, it&#146;s Ami.  She has school, a doctor&#146;s appointment with 
Makoto, a study session, then cram school,&#148; finished Kaya, having used 
her fingers to tick off the points of Ami&#146;s activities.  She smiled.  
&#147;My daughter has a full and busy life that will keep her out until at 
least ten tonight.  Since I get off at seven, it leaves me with several 
hours free.&#148;
	&#147;You wouldn&#146;t by chance have any plans for those few hours, would 
you?&#148; asked Ken.
	Kaya moved forward and took hold of the lapels of Ken&#146;s white 
jacket.  Letting the edges run through her fingers, she answered, &#147;I do.  
I&#146;m going to have dinner with a very handsome doctor.  Someplace nice, 
but not too fancy, where we can have a peaceful meal without any 
interruptions.&#148;
	Ken doubted such a place existed.  Rather than saying this, he 
replied, &#147;How about the Italian place out on the strip?  It&#146;s still 
early enough for us to get a reservation.&#148;
	&#147;Perfect,&#148; said Kaya, standing on tiptoe to reward him with a 
kiss.


*            *            *

	&#147;Everything looks good,&#148; said Ken.  &#147;You say the morning sickness 
is starting to ease up?&#148;
	Makoto nodded.  &#147;Either that or I&#146;m getting used to it.&#148;
	Ken chuckled.  &#147;I don&#146;t think I&#146;ve ever had a patient say they 
were getting used to it.  And while we&#146;re on the subject, I&#146;ve got 
something for you to try.  It&#146;ll make things more tolerable when it is 
bothering you.&#148;
	Makoto took the small, cardboard box that was handed to her.  She 
smiled.  &#147;Ami&#146;s mom gave me some of these a few weeks back.  Thank you.  
They do help.&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re welcome,&#148; Ken smiled back at the girl.  &#147;Now for the fun 
part.  Would you like to hear the baby&#146;s heartbeat?&#148;
	Makoto hesitated just long enough to make Ken wonder if she was 
going to say no.  Then she asked, &#147;Can Ami come in for this part?&#148;
	&#147;Of course.&#148;  Ken turned to his desk and pushed a button on his 
phone.  &#147;Chisa,&#148; he said into the intercom, &#147;could you ask Mizuno-san 
to come in here, please?&#148;
	A moment later there was a slight knock on the door before it 
opened.  &#147;Is everything all right?&#148; asked Ami as she came into the room.
	Makoto grinned at her.  &#147;Wanna hear the heartbeat?&#148;
	Ami&#146;s face lit up.  &#147;Can we?&#148;
	Ken nodded.  To Makoto he said, &#147;Lie back and get comfortable.  
We&#146;ll see how cooperative he&#146;s being today.&#148;
	&#147;She,&#148; corrected Makoto.  &#147;It&#146;s a girl.&#148;
	&#147;Right,&#148; replied Ken.  &#147;How cooperative she&#146;s being, then.&#148;
	Ami was standing next to her, and Makoto&#146;s hand reached out for 
hers.  Ami smiled down at her friend.  &#147;Excited?&#148; she asked.
	&#147;A little nervous,&#148; admitted Makoto.  &#147;You know, if this was a 
soap opera this would be the big Oh-God-there&#146;s-something-wrong 
moment.&#148;
	&#147;This isn&#146;t a soap opera, Mako-chan,&#148; said Ami reassuringly.  She 
reached out and brushed her fingers through Makoto&#146;s bangs.  &#147;There 
isn&#146;t going to be anything wrong.&#148;
	&#147;Ready?&#148; asked Ken.
	&#147;Yeah,&#148; answered Makoto even as her grip on Ami&#146;s hand tightened.
	Ken held what looked like an oddly shaped microphone attached to 
a mini amplifier.  It made Makoto think momentarily of Minako and how 
she would be jealous of this because she wanted to take the baby to her 
first karaoke session.
	After a bit of prodding and guess work, Ken positioned the 
microphone on Makoto&#146;s stomach.  He moved it a bit to the right, and 
after several seconds sound emerged from the amplifier.  The baby&#146;s 
heartbeat was steady and rapid and a bit muffled, as if it was coming 
from under water.  Which, Ami supposed, in a way it was.
	Makoto&#146;s expression changed from one of worry to that of quiet 
awe.  The sound was soothing in its own way.  She could listen to this 
forever, she thought.
	After several moments, a thought came to Makoto.  &#147;It sounds kind 
of like a starship engine at warp 10,&#148; she said.  &#147;Is it supposed to be 
that fast?&#148;
	Ken held back a laugh at both the comparison and the look on 
Ami&#146;s face.  He&#146;d heard the example before, but not being a &#145;Star Trek&#146; 
fan, he couldn&#146;t validate it one way or the other.  &#147;It sounds exactly 
the way it&#146;s supposed to,&#148; Ken answered Makoto&#146;s question.  He turned 
off the amplifier.  &#147;You&#146;re doing a good job taking care of the two of 
you.  Be proud of that.&#148;
	Makoto smiled.  &#147;I&#146;ve had a lot of help.&#148;  She winked at Ami, 
which made the smaller girl blush slightly.
	Ken noticed this and thought back on some of the things Kaya had 
said to him.  ~So it wasn&#146;t just her imagination,~ he thought.
	Makoto finished dressing in private.  On her way out, she 
scheduled her next appointment.  She wanted to hug everyone goodbye she 
felt so good, but managed to restrain herself long enough to get out of 
the office.
	If there was to be any quiet reflection on this afternoon&#146;s event, 
it was being put off until later.  As the two girls headed to Rei&#146;s, 
Makoto was nursing a hyperactivity that would have tired out Usagi.  
Ami hurried to keep up with her friend and the conversation Makoto was 
having mostly with herself.


*            *            *

	When Kaya got home that night there was a note waiting for her in 
place of her daughter.

	Mom,
		If it&#146;s okay, I&#146;m going to spend the night at 
	Mako-chan&#146;s tonight.  She&#146;s restless and needs some 
	help staying occupied.
		We got to hear the baby&#146;s heartbeat this 
	afternoon.  It was incredible.  I&#146;ve heard the sound 
	before, but never up close like that.  Mako-chan 
	thinks it sounds like a warp engine.  I think she&#146;s 
	been watching too much television.  I promise to tell 
	you all about it tomorrow night.

	Love, Ami

	Kaya sighed.  If she&#146;d known Ami wasn&#146;t coming home tonight, she 
wouldn&#146;t have either.  Rereading the note in her hand, Kaya thought 
back to her earlier actions.  A few pieces of candy didn&#146;t mean she was 
getting too involved.  She had to believe that this note didn&#146;t mean 
Ami was either.


*            *            *

	When Ami walked into Usagi&#146;s living room, the others were all 
seated on the floor surrounded by wrapping paper and bows.  It was 
early Sunday afternoon, and with Makoto&#146;s birthday only four days away, 
the girls were getting everything done and wrapped in one last minute 
group session.
	Minako leaned forward and picked through a pile of bows.  &#147;So she 
sees the stuff before I can put it away,&#148; she continued her story.  
&#147;Mom asks who all the baby stuff is for.  I tell her, and she gives me 
this blank look as she tries to remember which one of you Makoto is.&#148;  
Minako giggled.  &#147;Apparently it&#146;s a good thing she isn&#146;t Ami, because 
&#145;she doesn&#146;t have the hips for it.&#146;&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m not sure how I should take that,&#148; said Ami.  She sat next to 
Rei as the other girl struggled with the object she was trying to 
assemble.
	&#147;It gets better,&#148; said Minako.  She pressed the bow on top of the 
package, leaving both her hands free to better dramatize her story.  
&#147;Just as I think she&#146;s done with it, Mom suddenly realizes I&#146;ve never 
mentioned anything about any of my friend&#146;s getting married.  When I 
told her that was because none of them had, I thought she was going to 
have a stroke.&#148;  Minako put the back of one hand to her forehead, the 
other against her chest, and said dramatically, &#147;The things you young 
girls think you can get away with these days.  And just think of this 
girl&#146;s poor parents.  What they must be going through.&#148;
	The others giggled as Minako reverted back to her normal self.  
With a frown she said, &#147;I swear that woman remembers none of what I 
tell her and all of what I don&#146;t.&#148;
	&#147;I think I&#146;ve got it this time,&#148; said Rei triumphantly.  She held 
up her project for the others to see.
	The mobile turned slowly as Brahms Lullaby played softly.  The 
canopy of the mobile was yellow with a blue ruffle.  Pastel stars and 
swirls were dotted across the fabric.  From each of the four corners 
hung a plush star &#150; two yellow and two blue.  Hanging stationary in the 
middle was a cow jumping over a crescent moon.
	As Ami watched the mobile turn, something Minako said replayed 
through her mind.  &#147;How much baby stuff did all of you get?&#148;
	The girls laughed a bit nervously as Chibi-usa scooted back so 
she was half hidden behind Minako.
	&#147;I know we agreed no baby stuff,&#148; began Rei, &#147;but when you 
disappeared with Makoto and left us to our own devices, well&#133;&#148;
	&#147;We couldn&#146;t help it,&#148; picked up Usagi.  &#147;We went by this store, 
and it had a really cute crib all set up.  There were white rabbits 
carved into the posts of the crib and the bedding was all pink 
bunnies.&#148;
	&#147;So we went in,&#148; continued Minako.  &#147;It was just to look, honest.  
But then we saw all the clothes and toys and stuff.&#148;
	Back to Rei now.  &#147;And we saw the mobile and thought one little 
thing couldn&#146;t hurt.  Then we saw the picture frame that matched it.&#148;
	Minako held up the box she&#146;d just finished wrapping.  &#147;The moon&#146;s 
wearing a backwards baseball cap,&#148; she said with a grin.
	Usagi reached around and opened the box that was sitting next to 
her.  &#147;The picture frames were next to all those tiny, cute clothes, 
though,&#148; said Usagi as she laid out the contents of the box for Ami to 
see.  &#147;We are girls, after all.  It was inevitable.&#148;
	Ami had to admit the outfit Usagi was laying out was cute.  The 
light blue t-shirt had an embroidered teddy bear holding a balloon on 
it.  The words &#145;Baby&#146;s First Smile&#146; were stitched below it.  The 
matching shorts had a bear face sewn onto the seat.  The cap and 
booties were striped white and blue.
	&#147;Then I saw this,&#148; chimed in Minako.  &#147;And look, matching socks.&#148;  
She held up a pair of impossibly small yellow socks and a red onesie 
with &#145;Party.  My crib.  Three am.&#146; written in a childish scrawl across 
the front.
	Ami smiled at that.  The baby might think his three am feedings 
were a party, but she doubted Makoto would.  Then it hit her.  &#147;Did 
Chibi-usa help you pick these out?&#148; asked Ami, fairly certain she 
already knew the answer.
	The girls hesitated.  It was Usagi who finally spoke up to answer 
Ami&#146;s question.  &#147;It&#146;s not like she told us anything.  She just helped 
us pick out which would be better to get:  Pink bunnies or blue 
teddies.&#148;
	&#147;We got regular stuff, too,&#148; said Rei.  &#147;We didn&#146;t forget why we 
agreed not to buy a bunch of stuff for the baby for Makoto&#146;s birthday.&#148;
	Usagi&#146;s face lit up.  &#147;That&#146;s right,&#148; she said happily.  She 
scrambled to her feet and went over to Ami, pulling her up as well.  
&#147;You have to see what I got for her.  I was almost gonna give up, but 
then I saw this.  I think it&#146;s going to be a really good present, 
especially for Mako-chan.&#148;
	Usagi drug Ami into the kitchen.  She let go of the other girl to 
open the refrigerator and pull out a box with the logo for Usagi&#146;s 
favorite candy store on the lid.  Usagi pulled back the lid and her 
smile got even wider.
	&#147;Well?&#148; asked the blonde.  &#147;What do you think?&#148;
	Inside the box was a giant, cake-sized peanut butter cup.  &#145;Happy 
B-day Mako-chan&#146; was written across it in a combination of white 
chocolate and peanut butter chips.
	&#147;Usagi,&#148; said Ami with a grin, &#147;I think that when Mako-chan opens 
this you are going to be her most favorite person ever.&#148;
	Usagi beamed, obviously very pleased and happy with herself.
	Ami&#146;s smile lessened just a bit.  &#147;I have a favor to ask you, 
Usagi.  But I don&#146;t want you to misunderstand why I&#146;m asking and become 
unhappy.&#148;
	Usagi regarded her friend closely.  She could sense the unease 
Ami was feeling at what she was about to ask.  &#147;You can ask me anything, 
Ami.&#148;
	Ami took a breath, then said, &#147;The things you bought for the baby 
are all very nice.  I&#146;m sure Mako-chan will like them.  But could we 
hold off on giving them to her?&#148;
	&#147;Why?&#148; asked Usagi.
	&#147;Because of a very noticeable lack of the color pink,&#148; answered 
Ami.
	Usagi nodded her head.  Her eyes got slightly wider as what Ami 
was saying really clicked into place.  &#147;Oh, I get it.  We hadn&#146;t 
thought of that.&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s all right, Usagi,&#148; reassured Ami.  &#147;It&#146;s just that I think 
it would be better for her to find out it&#146;s a boy when she gets her 
ultrasound in a few weeks rather than through the birthday presents we 
give her.&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re right,&#148; said Usagi.  &#147;The others will think so, too.&#148;
	Ami relaxed a bit.  She understood the urge to baby shop for 
their friend.  She&#146;d indulged in it a bit herself.  The yellow onesie 
with &#145;Laptop Model&#146; printed on it that she had hidden on her closet 
shelf was a partial testament to that.
	Usagi returned the box to the refrigerator.  After closing the 
door, she leaned back against it.  &#147;How did you know?&#148; she asked Ami.
	&#147;Know what?&#148;
	&#147;That it was going to be a boy?&#148; answered Usagi.  &#147;Everybody else 
thought it was going to be a girl.  Even Mako-chan.&#148;
	~Because it&#146;s what I see when I think of her that way.~  Rather 
than giving that reply, Ami answered, &#147;It was just a guess.&#148;
	The slight color that rose in Ami&#146;s cheeks gave Usagi the 
impression there was more to it than what Ami was telling her.  &#147;Do you 
wanna know how I knew?&#148; questioned Usagi, her grin mischievous.
	&#147;How?&#148; asked Ami.
	&#147;Because you&#146;re never wrong.&#148;  Usagi laughed as Ami&#146;s cheeks grew 
even redder.  &#147;I told the others they should have let you bet first.&#148;
	Ami realized then why Usagi was so happy about this.  Between the 
two of them, they had just pocketed 4000 yen.  No doubt the blonde was 
having visions of video games and ice cream at the Crown.
	And just because it felt good to be on the winning end of things 
this time, Ami allowed herself to laugh, too.


*            *           *

	Ami relaxed back into her favorite reading chair at the public 
library.  She let out a deep breath as her body settled into the 
cushions.  This was a quiet corner away from the eyes of others.  
Sunlight filtered in through the window behind her, warming the area 
without giving any hint to just how cold it was outside.
	Ami almost felt bad about being glad to be away from Makoto this 
afternoon.  Almost, but not quite.  The other girl had been in a foul 
mood since she&#146;d woken up this morning.  It had all started because she 
refused to upsize her uniform (she didn&#146;t want to deal with the 
administration yet, even if half her teachers had figured it out 
already) to accommodate her expanding waistline.  She&#146;d been stabbed by 
the safety pins she was using to hold the skirt together more than once 
as she tried to get the clasps closed.  Then at breakfast, just to make 
Makoto&#146;s disposition even more unpleasant, she hadn&#146;t been able to 
scrape more than half a spoonful of peanut butter out of the jar.  
Makoto had gone on to curse every god she could think of for not 
reminding her to buy more the last time she was at the store.  The 
girls had given their friend a wide berth on the way to school and 
again on the way home, as her mood seemed to be getting increasingly 
worse.
	~She needs to sit and brood to herself for awhile,~ Ami told 
herself.  She then made the excuse that she needed to go do some 
research at the library.  Alone.
	Taking her reading book from her bag, Ami opened it to her 
favorite of the stories inside.  This was how Saturday afternoons were 
supposed to be, she thought, quiet and peaceful.
	Some time later, the quiet was abruptly shattered by the sound of 
liquid being slurped through a straw right behind Ami&#146;s head.
	Startled, Ami jumped and slammed her book shut.  She turned 
around to see Usagi standing behind her with a can of soda in her hand.
	&#147;Awww,&#148; said the blonde, disappointed, &#147;it was just getting to 
the good part.&#148;
	Usagi had obviously been reading over her shoulder.  Ami, not 
wanting to discuss the &#145;good part&#146; Usagi was referring to, diverted 
with, &#147;I&#146;m surprised to see you in the library, Usagi.  I thought you 
were going to the arcade with Rei and Minako.&#148;
	Usagi flopped down in the chair beside Ami&#146;s.  &#147;Yeah, that was 
what I wanted to do.  But Chibi-usa has a report due on Monday, and Mom 
made me bring her here so she could work on it.&#148;
	&#147;Oh,&#148; replied Ami, not really sure what else she could say.
	&#147;So,&#148; said Usagi, her demeanor brightening as she leaned forward, 
&#147;are you going to read the rest of that book?&#148;
	&#147;I&#133; I&#146;ve read it already,&#148; stuttered out Ami.
	&#147;It&#146;s a reread, huh,&#148; replied Usagi.  &#147;I didn&#146;t think you could 
do that with regular books.&#148;  The blonde&#146;s smile widened as she asked, 
&#147;Can I read it, then?&#148;
	Ami held the book protectively to her chest.  &#147;I really don&#146;t 
think you&#146;d like it, Usagi.  Maybe a more traditional romance&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Oh, come on.  Please,&#148; wheedled Usagi.  &#147;I&#146;ve read stuff like 
that before.  You should see some of the doujins Rei sneaks from her 
grandfather.&#148;
	&#147;She let you read them?&#148; asked a surprised Ami.
	&#147;I read all of Rei&#146;s manga,&#148; said Usagi as if it was silly for 
Ami to even ask such a thing.
	Ami&#146;s grip on the book loosened as she considered her friend&#146;s 
request.  &#147;All right,&#148; she said finally.  &#147;If you really want to.&#148;
	Usagi took the book eagerly.  &#147;&#146;Raindrops in the Garden.&#146;  It&#146;s 
not a library book?&#148; she asked after quickly flipping through the pages.
	&#147;No,&#148; answered Ami.  &#147;It belongs to me.&#148;
	Usagi nodded and opened the book to the table of contents.  &#147;Hey, 
it&#146;s Mako-chan&#146;s butterfly!&#148; she exclaimed.  She held the book around 
so Ami could see the pencil sketch at the corner of the page.  &#147;Is this 
the book that was a gift?&#148;
	&#147;Yes.&#148;
	Usagi giggled.  &#147;Now I know why it made you so happy,&#148; she teased.
	Ami&#146;s cheeks turned bright red.  &#147;I didn&#146;t know what it was about 
when I picked it up,&#148; said Ami in a quiet rush.  &#147;I didn&#146;t even know it 
would get that&#133; graphic&#133; until I got to that one story.  The rest of 
them are just regular stories about the women of the house, all of them 
connected through that butterfly.  And Mako-chan never read it at all.  
She just took it out of my hands and bought it for me&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Ami,&#148; cut in Usagi.
	Ami took a breath and blinked at the blonde.
	Usagi laughed softly.  &#147;You are way too easy to fluster.&#148;  Usagi 
leaned back in her chair and reopened the book.  &#147;Now, which story were 
we reading?&#148;
	&#147;Are you certain you wouldn&#146;t rather start with another story?&#148; 
tried Ami.  The idea of Usagi reading this book, not to mention this 
particular story, had her more nervous than she could explain.  &#147;There 
are some good ones in there.  My favorite is &#145;The Stone Pathway.&#146;&#148;
	Usagi pulled the book back as Ami tried to reach for it.  &#147;I&#146;ll 
read that one later,&#148; said Usagi.  &#147;Tell me which one, please, Ami.&#148;
	Ami sighed and sunk back into her chair.  &#147;&#146;After the Storm.&#146;&#148;
	Hiding behind another book, Ami tried not to watch Usagi as she 
read.  She couldn&#146;t shake the feeling that she was somehow corrupting 
this girl.  So Ami watched as Usagi&#146;s facial expression and posture 
changed as she got further into the story.  One minute the blonde would 
be sitting upright, her eyes wide.  The next, she would be laying 
across the chair, her feet dangling over the arm as she chewed on her 
finger.
	Ami peeked over her book once again to peer at Usagi.  She was 
once again upright.  Her eyes were round as saucers and her head was 
tilted slightly to the side as if she were trying to make out a 
particularly jumbled picture.
	&#147;I wonder if Rei and Minako ever do anything like this,&#148; Usagi 
wondered out loud.  She looked over at Ami and promptly burst into 
hysterical giggles.
	Ami could feel the heat in her cheeks.  She fidgeted, hoping she 
could disappear into the cushions of the chair.
	Usagi sobered a bit.  &#147;Don&#146;t worry, Ami.  I promise I won&#146;t tell 
anyone you read naughty stories.  Or that Mako-chan bought them for 
you.&#148;
	Somehow that assurance did nothing to make Ami feel any better.


*            *            *

	Makoto was sitting in front of the computer, a spoon dangling 
from her mouth.  She carefully read over the last few paragraphs she&#146;d 
typed.  Deciding they looked fine, she saved the document and reached 
for her jar of peanut butter.  It was amazing how such a simple thing 
could make one feel so much better when the world was so obviously out 
to get you.
	The front door opened and Ami walked in.
	&#147;Hey.  I was wondering when you&#146;d get home,&#148; called Makoto, 
considerably happier than when Ami had last seen her.  &#147;Did you do what 
you needed to?&#148;
	&#147;Yes,&#148; answered Ami.
	&#147;Great,&#148; replied Makoto.  &#147;I went shopping while you were out.&#148;  
She held up her peanut butter as proof.  &#147;Hope you&#146;re hungry.  I&#146;m 
going to start dinner as soon as I finish this paper.  A few more 
paragraphs and it should be done.&#148;
	&#147;What are you working on?&#148; asked Ami as she moved over to stand 
beside Makoto and look at the monitor.
	&#147;My history report,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;There isn&#146;t a thing in 
this paper that man can complain about.&#148;
	Watashi-sensei again.  Ami wondered if he was part of the problem 
earlier.
	&#147;I could proof read it for you,&#148; offered Ami.
	&#147;Would you?  I&#146;d appreciate it,&#148; replied Makoto.  &#147;But not until 
later.  I feel like cooking.  Heh, I haven&#146;t said that in a while.&#148;
	&#147;What are we having?&#148;
	&#147;Stew sound good?&#148;
	Ami nodded.
	&#147;All right.  I&#146;ll get to it, then.&#148;  Makoto closed her program, 
having had enough of homework for tonight, and left the computer for 
Ami to play with.
	Ami had checked her e-mail and was browsing through one of the 
websites she frequented when Makoto called to her from the kitchen.
	A pot was boiling lazily on the stove, and Makoto was leaning 
against the breakfast counter.  She was staring down at nothing, as if 
she were concentrating to hear a faint sound.  Without looking up, she 
motioned to Ami.  &#147;Come here.  Quick.&#148;
	Ami was trying not to panic.  &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; she asked as she 
hurried to Makoto&#146;s side.
	Makoto shook her head and grabbed for Ami&#146;s wrist.  She held it 
for several seconds, making a few indecisive sounds.  Then she placed 
Ami&#146;s hand against her stomach, shook her head no, and moved the hand 
to the same position under her shirt.
	Ami&#146;s heart rate doubled at the physical contact.  Soft skin was 
beneath her palm, which was being held in place by a strong and gentle 
hand.  Ami could hear her blood rushing in her ears, and she was 
certain she was blushing clear to the tops of her ears.
	&#147;There,&#148; said Makoto excitedly.  &#147;Can you feel it?&#148;
	&#147;Wh&#133; what?&#148; asked Ami.
	&#147;The baby,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;Can you feel it?  I thought I felt 
her move earlier, but I wasn&#146;t sure.&#148;
	Ami snapped out of her daze as she realized what was happening.  
Makoto&#146;s smile lit up her whole face.  Ami returned some of it shyly.  
&#147;He&#146;s still too small for anyone but you to feel him,&#148; said Ami quietly.  
Without meaning to, she began to stroke her thumb against Makoto&#146;s skin.  
&#147;This is something special for just you right now.  A secret only the 
two of you get to know.&#148;
	Makoto&#146;s eyes met and held Ami&#146;s.  &#147;I wanted to share,&#148; she 
replied just as quietly as Ami had.
	&#147;You&#146;ll get to soon enough.  Then you&#146;ll wish we&#146;d all go away 
and stop touching you,&#148; said Ami with a small laugh.
	&#147;No,&#148; said Makoto seriously.  &#147;I&#146;d never want you to go away.&#148;
	Ami felt like she was drowning.  She was trapped in the green 
depths of Makoto&#146;s eyes.  Everything she saw there stole her breath 
away and left her mind spinning.  It wasn&#146;t until Makoto&#146;s hand over 
hers tightened that she had any sense of what she and her wayward thumb 
were doing.
	Quickly averting her eyes, Ami carefully extricated her hand from 
Makoto&#146;s.  &#147;Do&#133; do you still want to have dinner?&#148;  It was a stupid 
question, but it was the only thing that came to her.
	Makoto stood straighter, away from the counter.  &#147;Yeah,&#148; she said 
haltingly.  &#147;Yeah, of course.  I just have to&#133;&#148;  She made a vague 
gesture at the stove.
	Ami started backing away towards the door.  &#147;I&#146;ll shut down the 
computer and then set the table.&#148;
	Ami disappeared through the kitchen door as quickly as she could.  
She never heard Makoto curse herself for being stupid and careless.  
Though she did here the cupboard door slam shut as the taller girl&#146;s 
foot made contact with it.
	Once outside the kitchen, Ami sagged against the wall.  She took 
a few calming breaths and prayed to whatever higher powers were 
listening to help her make it through the rest of the night.
