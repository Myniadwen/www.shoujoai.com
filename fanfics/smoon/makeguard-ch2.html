Three weeks earlier...

Queen Serenity, ruler of the Moon Kindgom, sat behind a large white desk 
drumming her fingers thoughtfully along the hard surface. Her eyes were 
closed in concentration as she considered her choices in the matter at 
hand. Her daughter Usagi&#39;s birthday was little more than a month away 
and she had yet to make any plans. Procrastination was not something she 
was akin to, but in this matter it was hard. This was to be her 20th 
birthday celebration and it was supposed to be a special event for all.

A knock at the door broke into her troubled thoughts. She looked up 
towards the door across the room from her desk. &quot;Please come in.&quot; She 
tried to use a cheerful voice, but decided she inevitably sounded 
cheerfully tired. A small girl stepped in with a bright smile on her 
face and bowed lowly. &#39;Well, at least someone is happy today,&#39; she 
thought. The girl stood straight and announced in the most official 
sounding voice she could muster, &quot;Your Highness, Queen Pluto would like 
to request an audience with you.&quot;

&quot;Please bring Lady Setsuna in,&quot; she said, nodding to the retreating 
girl. &#39;I wonder what this is about. The Guardian of Time does not leave 
her post for reasons to be taken lightly.&#39; She sighed in frustration. 
&#39;This is all I need now.&#39;

A few minutes later, the door opened once more. This time a tall 
brunette walked in. Her dark hair flowing behind her as she walked 
purposefully towards the other woman. She stopped in front of Serenity&#39;s 
desk and bowed before her.

&quot;Arise Lady Setsuna, for it has been so long since I have last seen 
you.&quot; Smiling, Serenity stood and rounded the desk. She embraced the 
tall woman before her in a tight hug.

&quot;It has not been that long. Only a few years.&quot; Setsuna replied, equally 
please with seeing her queen.

&quot;Oh, but the absence of a friend&#39;s company always seems so long. Whether 
it be a day or a hundred years,&quot; the queen said hastily.

Setsuna smiled in her mysterious way. &quot;It is the thought that I have 
such friends here that keeps me moving forward. If not for that, my duty 
would be an unbearably lonely one. To have companions is a great thing.&quot; 
While she was speaking her face became sad. &quot;I have come here today to 
discuss something important with you Highness.&quot;

Serenity offered the woman a seat, which she took gratefully. She waited 
forSetsuna to begin speaking. &quot;It is in regards to one of your 
daughter&#39;s guardians. It is faint now, but I can sense a darkness. Right 
now it is so small, it is almost undetectable. With time, however, it 
will grow. This could become a very big problem for you.&quot; She paused and 
hesitantly went on. &quot;It is discouraging that the court of the Moon might 
become so disunited if this happens. You must understand, though, that I 
can not tell you anymore than I already have. It is your duty to locate 
the guardian that harbors this darkness. Then it is you obligation to 
help them. You must come up with the solution on your own.&quot; Setsuna 
smiled at the confused and surprised looked that graced the Queen&#39;s 
beautiful features. &quot;Do not worry, Milady, for I am certain that you can 
do this. You are our leader, and it is you whom we protect. We would not 
do so if we did not find you worthy of pledging our lives to.&quot;

&quot;Do nottalk in such a way Setsuna. I would never allow any of you to 
give up your lives. You all are my closest allies and friends. You know 
that.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Milady, I do know this. However, do the rest of your guardians 
know this? The outer guardians as well as the young inner guardians?&quot; 
Setsuna stood gracefully. &quot;I must go now Highness. What little time I 
have spent here is more than I had expected.&quot;

Serenity stood as well. &quot;You just arrived and you are leaving already? 
Tell me Setsuna, how am I supposed to know which one it is? I only know 
a few of the inner guardians. They mostly converse with my daughter, for 
they are her guardians after all. Is my daughter to share this burden? 
Should I tell her of what the future may hold?&quot; Serenity&#39;s voice was 
desperate.

Setsuna had reached the door by this point. Turning to look over her 
shoulder she addressed her Queen. &quot;You do not have to tell her anything 
at all. Suspicion will only lead to misunderstandings. This guardian is 
not a criminal or enemy, they are merely confused. It is understandable 
why.&quot; She turned the handle on the door and opened it. &quot;I am going to 
return now, to the gates. I will go about my duty happily because I know 
whom I protect and why. To not know, however, that is completely 
different. When I was younger, I wonder what path I would have taken if 
I was not loved as I am now. I would probably still be somewhere within 
the depths of the Castle of Pluto...or maybe worse. Goodbye for now Lady 
Serenity. Until we meet again.&quot; Shethen walkedout, closing the door 
behind her in the silent room.

Serenity stood looking at the closed door through which the Guardian of 
Pluto had just left. &#39;What am I supposed to do now? I have to do 
something about a possible rogue guardian, and my daughter&#39;s birthday.&#39; 
She sat in her chair, thinking. It was one of her daughter&#39;s guardians 
then.

&#39;It could not be any of the Outer guardians...I speak with them every 
week by messenger.&#39; She tried to remember all the times she had 
encountered any of her daughter&#39;s guardians. Most of them came to the 
Moon Kingdom when their parents were summoned for meetings of the royal 
court. Though she could remember seeing Princess Minako a bit more than 
the rest. Her daughter was very good friends with the princess of Venus. 
She smiled, thinking about all the times Minako and Usagi had gotten 
into trouble together. In fact, one particular trouble session had 
occurred not three months ago. Minako had discovered some sort of love 
dust that was a specialty of Venus, and only to be issued by the royal 
court. It had not turned out well when the two made a sweep of the 
Palace, matchmaking everywhere. It had the opposite effect on most, and 
the two were cooped up in their respective rooms for two days writing 
apology letters to their victims. She remembered being furious at the 
time, but now that she looked back on the event, she found it very 
amusing.

Leaning forward on her desk, she began to recount the times she had met 
the others. The princess of Mars came regularly to report any visions 
she may have had. She would also visit with Usagi often, but this 
usually ended with her daughter running to her reporting that the 
Martian princess was picking on her again. Her daughter could be such a 
crybaby at times, but she loved her just the same. She didn&#39;t scold Rei 
for her treatment of her daughter either. Thinking that it would be 
healthy for Usagi could use some of the criticism, and she knew Rei 
would never do anything to hurt her.

&#39;Let&#39;s see now, that leaves Ami and Makoto...Ami is always in her study 
reading, but she does pay visits to the palace. Even if it is just to 
spend time in the royal library. It is the largest in the universe after 
all,&#39; she thought. She had come to the conclusion long ago that the 
young princess of Mercury loved knowledge and seemed to do most of her 
living in her head. The girl was the smallest of the guardians and was 
not as strong as the rest. Her power lay in her mind.

&#39;The princess of Jupiter...&#39; Serenity sat up straight as she remembered 
something. She felt so stupid for having forgot. Makoto&#39;s parents were 
dead. The last she had seen of the girl had been many years ago when she 
was but a child. Serenity had always tried to invite the girl to various 
events such as balls and parties, but the girl always declined. 
Respecting what Makoto had gone through, she decided to let her have her 
space. She even went so far as to let her send a representative to the 
royal court meetings. She remembered the young man now, he was Makoto&#39;s 
Captain...Shinozaki if she remembered right. He would report on the 
statistics of the population of Jupiter&#39;s satellites and various other 
idiosyncrasies. One thought had struck her as odd lately in their 
meetings. The Jovian princess&#39;s army had grown to twice its original 
size within the past year. That was a lot considering the population of 
Jupiter was the lowest among the 9 planets. Then she had disregarded it 
because the Jovian people were very rugged. They were more prone to 
become soldiers than say the people of Mercury or Venus. The same could 
be said for Mars and Uranus, however, and their armies were growing at 
an even rate.

&#39;There is too much to consider. I need to get them all in one place, 
then I&#39;ll compare their distinctions and how they react with each other. 
I do not think I have ever seen them all together at once in fact. I 
also need to figure out something to do for Usagi.&#39; A thought hit her 
like a bolt of lighting. &#39;A ball. They will all attend and I can oversee 
them there...as well as all the other guests.&#39; She sighed. &#39;That will 
not work. I need more time than one night to observe them, and I can not 
devote all my time to five girls in a room of over three hundred.&#39; She 
continued to think. Another knock at the door disturbed her thoughts.

&quot;Come in.&quot; She said dejectedly.

&quot;Hello mother!&quot; Her daughter came flying through the door and threw her 
arms about her mother&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Are you busy right now?&quot;

Serenity hugged her daughter back and noticed another figure slip 
through the door of her study. &quot;Hello your Highness,&quot; said princess 
Minako, bowing.

Serenity smiled in return. &quot;Hello Minako. You two are staying out of 
trouble I assume.&quot; She gave them both a stern look as her daughter 
finally released her.

&quot;Of course mother.&quot; Usagi answered, looking innocent. &quot;Anyway, we were 
wondering if Minako could stay for a couple of days. Pleeeease, we&#39;ll be 
good and won&#39;t get into any trouble. I&#39;ll even do some extra lesson to 
make up for it.&quot; Her daughter gave her a beseeching look that Minako 
mimicked behind her.

The Queen was on the verge of laughing. Here she was worrying over 
Usagi&#39;s future and birthday, and her daughter&#39;s top priority was 
spending a couple days with her friend. &#39;I should be so considerate of 
my own friends,&#39; she thought. &quot;Yes, my daughter, she can stay the next 
few days here.&quot; Usagi began doing something akin to a victory dance 
while hanging from Serenity&#39;s shoulders once again.

&quot;This is great mother. Isn&#39;t it Minako?&quot;

&quot;Yep. Though, it would be incredibly so if it was about a month long 
stay!&quot; she replied jokingly. &quot;Think of all the stuff we could do then.&quot; 
Usagi laughed in reply and started making her way toward the door.

Queen Serenity sat still for a moment watching her daughter go to leave. 
Something about what Minako had just said struck her as a great idea. If 
she had all the guardians stay for a month, then she would have plenty 
of time to get to know them. &#39;Yes, this will work perfectly!&#39; she 
thought triumphantly.

&quot;Usagi, wait a moment dear.&quot; Her daughter froze and turned around. She 
looked at if she expected her mother to changer her mind about letting 
Minako stay for a while. &quot;You have not let me tell you what I have 
planned for your birthday celebration.&quot; She smiled as Usagi&#39;s face lit 
up. &#39;Yes, this will work very well...I hope.&#39;</pre>
