<h1>Aishiteru (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pyrovenus.html">Pyro Venus</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/aishi-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Chapter Three:

Rei&#39;s wine-colored eyes fluttered open, suddenly realizing that the 
slim, warm pair o arms that had held her as she had fallen asleep were 
no longer there. She could feel no presence emitting from anywhere in 
the room, or the house for that matter, and there was a feeling that 
wouldn&#39;t subside in her stomach. Something was desperately wrong. She 
rolled over to face the place where her dear Minako would be- only she 
wasn&#39;t. Instead, nearly poking her in the eye with it&#39;s corner, lay a 
piece of paper.

It had no name, yet Rei somehow knew it was from Minako, and that it 
wasn&#39;t good.

She hastily plucked it from her pillow and unfolded it, cutting her 
index finger in the process. 

&quot;Rei, I am truly sorry for my unwelcome departure, but I don&#39;t know 
what to think anymore...&quot; She began to read, tears streaming down her 
face as each word spilled from her lips. She loved Minako. She truly 
did! And yet... As much as the miko hated to admit it...the blonde had 
a point. Maybe they should move on, and just forget about it.

&quot;No.&quot; The ebony-haired woman murmured to herself. &quot;No. I won&#39;t let you 
go, Minako.&quot; She vowed, her amethyst eyes taking on a dangerous gleam. 
&quot;No, Minako. You&#39;re not getting away. Not that easily.&quot;

	

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Minako ran blindly for what seemed like hours, but in reality was only 
about twenty minutes. By two in the morning, she found herself on the 
Tsukino&#39;s doorstep, now unsure what to do. 

&quot;When all else fails...&quot; She muttered. Pressing the small circle that 
served as a doorbell, she held her breath and hoped that she didn&#39;t 
wake Ikuko or Kenji. She got her wish. 17-year-old Shingo opened the 
door, and stared wide-eyed at the curvaceous blonde on his doorstep.

&quot;Mi-Mi-Mi-Minako...&quot; He stammered, blinking once or twice to make sure 
she wasn&#39;t a sudden apparition. &quot;What&#39;re you doing here?&quot; He asked.

Minako knew Shingo&#39;d had a crush on her for the past three years, but 
wasn&#39;t in the mood to deal with it. &quot;I&#39;m here to see Usagi, Shingo.&quot; 
She croaked, her voice hollow and choked, suddenly. Rei was sure to 
have read her letter by now. 

&quot;Uhhh...come on in.&quot; The sable-haired teenager stuttered, looking 
Minako&#39;s voluptuous body up and down. (A/N~ all the Inner Senshi are 
19)

She gratefully accepted the invitation, shivering as she entered the 
Tsukino&#39;s living area, and immediately whisking past Shingo to go up 
the stairs to Usagi&#39;s bedroom.

She found her fellow blonde, snoring away on her futon. 

&quot;Usagi?&quot; Minako whispered, poking the ditz in the forehead. She didn&#39;t 
stir. &quot;Usa-chan?&quot; Poke. &quot;Uuuuusssaaagggiii...&quot; Pokepoke. &quot;USAGI YOU 
DITZ!!!&quot; SMACK!

&quot;Huh? What is it Lu-Minako?&quot;

&quot;Oh great. I am now Lu-Minako, Such love!&quot;

&quot;Gomen, Mina-chan, I thought you were Luna. What&#39;re you doing here?&quot; 
Usagi questioned, oblivious to the tears streaming down Minako&#39;s face. 
Only when Minako turned the bedside light on did she see them. 
&quot;Mina-chan? What happened?! Why are you crying?!&quot; Her voice began as a 
hushed whisper so as not to wake her parents, but ended up almost a 
shriek of pure concern.

&quot;Oh, Serenity!!! I did a terrible thing to Rei!&quot; The golden-haired girl 
sniffed, sitting on the edge of Usagi&#39;s bed and telling her what had 
happened.

~A Half-hour Later~

&quot;So you just walked out on her after that?&quot; Usagi asked, having been 
all-ears during her friend&#39;s confession. Minako nodded, her azure eyes 
full of self-revulsion. 

&quot;I mean.... I love Rei and everything, but I have a duty to my family. 
All my life, I&#39;ve always been the oldest child, and my parents expect 
me to settle down with a good husband, have some kids and live my life 
the way they&#39;ve always told me too. I&#39;m supposed to please them, and 
during this thing going on with my little sister...learning she&#39;s 
bisexual and all...I just don&#39;t want to disappoint them! Is that so 
wrong?&quot;

&quot;Minako...I have no problem with that, but is pleasing your family 
worth breaking the heart of somebody that&#39;s given you all her love? 
I&#39;ve seen it in her eyes, and I can&#39;t believe you of all people would 
be so blind as to not recognize it, and when you finally do recognize 
her love for you...you walk out on her like you can both just forget 
it! You&#39;re such a baka, Minako. She loves you, you love her, and that&#39;s 
all that matters! Can&#39;t you see that? Can&#39;t you tell?&quot; Usagi demanded 
of Minako, her voice holding such ferocity that her fellow Senshi 
turned away in embarrassment as she realized that her Princess was 
right.

&quot;But...my family...&quot; Minako began weakly.

&quot;Minako, you haven&#39;t heard a word I&#39;ve said, have you? I may be a 
klutz, and I may be a crybaby, but, unlike you, I&#39;M NOT BLIND when it 
comes to true love!&quot; 

&quot;True love doesn&#39;t EXIST for me, Usagi! I&#39;ve accepted that fact for 
years, and now this thing with Rei has come up and... I feel so 
confused...I don&#39;t know what to think anymore! I need some time!&quot; 
Minako said, laying her head down on Usagi&#39;s pillow. &quot;And some sleep 
while I&#39;m at it.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Sitting at the Fire Shrine, Rei realized that she&#39;d been sitting in the 
same spot for over three hours, wondering what to do about Minako. She 
had come to the conclusion that she wouldn&#39;t let Minako do this to her, 
but she didn&#39;t know how to confront her about it. Where would the 
blonde have gone to? Another Senshi&#39;s house? Her home? 

Maybe she had gone to the park to think things over. Or possibly her 
college dorm. The possibilities were endless. Nevertheless, she tried 
the Senshi communicator first. Haruka and Michiru were the most likely 
candidates, due to she and Minako&#39;s situation and all. So she pressed 
the gold and blue striped button for Sailor Uranus, and a sharp-eyed 
Haruka answered.

&quot;What is it Rei, a Youma attack?&quot; She queried harshly. Rei noted that 
the top-half of the slim woman seemed uncovered. 

&quot;Uhhh...sorry to...interrupt...&quot; The amethyst-eyed miko began. Haruka 
waved a hand in the air, as if dismissing the comment. 

&quot;Never mind what we were doing, just tell us what&#39;s the matter. Being 
as how you don&#39;t look like you normally do before a battle, I&#39;m judging 
it&#39;s not a Youma. What&#39;s the matter, Rei? Girl trouble?&quot; How did she 
guess? Rei decided to play it cool and calm.

&quot;What do you mean by &#39;girl trouble&#39;?&quot; She asked suspiciously.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen the way you look at Minako, Rei. Need advice?&quot; Haruka asked, 
this time more gently than before. 

&quot;Well...not exactly...&quot; She muttered, looking down. &quot;We 
kinda...sorta...well...you know...&quot;

&quot;Slept together?&quot; Suggested the dirty-blonde as Rei turned even redder 
and redder until she look ready to burst into flames. &quot;Nothing to be 
ashamed about, Rei. 

&quot;I know!&quot; The still-blushing miko exclaimed, a bit rudely. &quot;It&#39;s 
just...well...she left afterward and left a note... And now I don&#39;t 
know where she is. Obviously she&#39;s not with you guys, and-&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s probably with Usagi. You know... Two blondes. Let&#39;s just hope 
that...&quot;

Rei caught the drift of what Haruka was trying to say, and her mind&#39;s 
eye flashed upon an image of Usagi and Minako in the Odango Atama&#39;s 
bed, the Princess stroking her first-in-command Senshi&#39;s hair and 
kissing her neck passionately. She blinked once, the picture wouldn&#39;t 
leave her. A second blink, and it was as if she was actually seeing her 
beloved and her Princess together. The picture was more than she could 
bear, and she sat bolt-upright. Her vision cleared, and she was looking 
into Haruka&#39;s concerned face. 

&quot;Rei? Rei-Chan, are you OK? It was just a joke!&quot; The short-haired 
blonde exclaimed, cocking her head to the side at the disturbed look 
upon the miko&#39;s facial cast.	

&quot;Huh? Oh...yeah, I know you were joking, Ruka-san. It&#39;s just...I&#39;m 
going to go call Usagi now. Bye. Mars out.&quot;

&quot;Good luck, Rei. Uranus, out.&quot; The tiny picture on the screen of Haruka 
disappeared, and the stunning ebony-haired woman was left alone with 
her own imagination of what was going on at Usagi&#39;s house.

Finally, she got up the nerve to press the pink button on her 
communicator

&quot;Hai?&quot; Usagi asked as soon as she appeared on the screen. Rei could see 
that the Odango Atama was still in her pajamas. &quot;Oh...hi, 
Rei-chan...what are you calling me for at two-o&#39;clock?&quot; She questioned, 
looking around quite nervously

&quot;Uhhh...hey Odango-chan...have you seen Minako? She left my house and-&quot;

&quot;Oh! After...&quot; Usagi let her sentence hang in the air, hoping Rei would 
get her meaning. The violet-eyed miko looked extremely guilty and 
suspicious.

&quot;After what, Odango?&quot; Rei asked, arching a perfectly-formed eyebrow and 
attempting not to look embarrassed.

&quot;Pyro, you know what I mean!!!&quot; Usagi said, glaring at somebody behind 
her and turning her softer gaze toward Rei, who knew immediately who 
was receiving Usagi&#39;s icy glare.

&quot;Minako IS there, isn&#39;t she, Usa-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hai, but I don&#39;t know if she is ready to talk to you yet, Rei. She 
told me everything, and she&#39;s pretty ashamed of herself. Aren&#39;t you, 
Mina-chan?&quot; A bump was heard and then a hiss of &quot;Answer me&quot;. 

&quot;H-h-h-hai...&quot; Minako&#39;s muffled voice could be heard in the background. 

&quot;Please put her on the communicator.&quot; Rei pleaded &quot;PLEASE.&quot; Her voice 
was choked with emotion and force. Normally, Usagi would have relented, 
but she stood firm in her determination.

&quot;Gomen nasai, Rei-Chan. I can&#39;t do that. Minako can&#39;t be forced to 
speak against her will. Now, I have to go. Bye.&quot;

&quot;Usa-chan...wait...&quot; She begged feebly, only to be met by the faint 
buzz as the screen went black, and Rei was once again left with the 
weak comfort of the flickering, dying fire.

A/N: Wheeeeee! Yet more to come... MUCH more! This is kinda like a 
soapbox if you think about it. Too much drama!!! TOO *gag* MUCH *choke* 
DRAMAAAAA!!! Anyway, hope you guys can give little old me some ideas on 
how to improve my story and/or writing style. If so, e-mail me at 
gothic_pyro66613@yahoo.com Hope to hear from u soon!!! :)

Bye-bye!
