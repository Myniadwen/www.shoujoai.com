<h1>Tints of Red, Shades of Pink</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grandmoff.html">GrandMoff</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The pink-haired girl glanced up from the book she was grudgingly 
reading.  She heard footsteps in the long hall.  The approaching 
person was obviously light, wearing high heels.  She would know who 
the lady was once she got to her room door.  That would be any step 
now.

Red skirt.  Black hair, long, straight, and fine.  Deep, violet eyes.  
A serious, almost severe face that quickly put on a joyful smile when 
she saw the young lady she&#146;d been looking for.

&#147;ChibiUsa!  Ohayo-gozimasu.&#148;

&#147;Ohayo, Rei-chan!&#148;  A goofy grin appeared on ChibiUsa&#146;s lips and 
refused to leave.  It made the young, odangoed princess look even more 
cheerful than usual.

&#147;It seems that you&#146;re having a good time this morning,&#148; Rei said 
casually as she approached ChibiUsa&#146;s chair.

&#147;Now I am.  Rei-chan, why do I have to study, anyway?  I&#146;m the Moon 
Princess.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s exactly why.  You need to be able to understand and try to 
solve the problems that people will bring to you.  They will be 
looking to you for wisdom.&#148;

Rei&#146;s voice softened, growing playful.  &#147;But since I&#146;m your tutor for 
today, how about we put aside musty old books for a while?  I have a 
more interesting way to teach.&#148;

&#147;Yes, please!  I could go crazy sitting here.&#148;

&#147;All right.  Let&#146;s go to the Shrine Wing.&#148;  ChibiUsa leapt from her 
chair, gave Rei a grateful hug, and held her hand as they strolled 
through the palace.  ChibiUsa had re-aged to sixteen now, but her 
cute, endearing mannerisms still reminded everyone of her mother.  She 
was taller than the queen, and she kept her bushy pink hair in a very 
similar style.  With the way she charmed everyone she met, she was 
obviously Serenity and Endymion&#146;s daughter.

&#147;You always teach the best lessons,&#148; ChibiUsa complimented the 
black-haired priestess.  &#147;I learn a lot every time you&#146;re my tutor.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m glad,&#148; Rei said, beaming.  &#147;I don&#146;t mind being old and boring as 
long as I can help your education.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll never be old or boring!&#148; ChibiUsa rebuked forcefully.  She 
unconsciously tightened her grip on Rei&#146;s hand.  She and her 
purple-eyed teacher looked at each other in surprise.  &#147;I-I just don&#146;t 
like hearing anyone talk badly about you,&#148; the pink-haired girl 
explained as she blushed.

&#147;Thank you, Odango-chan,&#148; Rei responded.  She was embarrassed but 
touched by her younger friend&#146;s strong feelings.

The two young women got to Rei&#146;s suite or rooms, removed their shoes, 
and entered.  ChibiUsa had always loved Rei&#146;s apartment, even when she 
was a little girl.  Well, the spacious complex was really more like a 
mansion than an apartment, but Rei called it an apartment.  It had 
high, vaulted ceilings supported by thick cedar beams.  The floors 
were rose marble with fuzzy crimson rugs strewn freely around making 
random, asymmetrical shapes.  The exterior walls were giant panes of 
translucent crystal of all different pastel hues.  Colossal baby blue 
drapes hung from brass rods, held open by dark blue sashes.  Every 
room had a fireplace.  In this room, the fire pit was right in the 
middle and the roof above it was open to the sky.  The scent of pine 
smoke and jasmine hung in the air.

&#147;It&#146;s high time that I showed you how I consult the flames, so that is 
how we&#146;ll start today,&#148; Rei instructed.

&#147;I thought only you could do that.&#148;

&#147;No, anyone can do it.  Some people will get more from it than other 
people will, but anyone can learn this type of divining.&#148;

&#147;But you&#146;re better at it than anyone else is, ne?&#148; ChibiUsa inquired.

&#147;I am fortunate that the fire shows me a lot.  Yes, I glean more 
information than most people would; but who knows?  You may have the 
same gift.  You are a very bright girl.&#148;

Rei busied herself with the incense and materials while ChibiUsa sat 
on a huge cushion and watched the fire.  &#147;Okay,&#148; Rei said at last, 
&#147;are you ready to try it?&#148;

&#147;How do I start?&#148; ChibiUsa asked nervously.

&#147;First you make sure you have your incense and your fan ready.  Now 
you kneel close to the fire.&#148;

&#147;Like this?&#148;

&#147;Yes, that&#146;s right.  Now you take just a pinch&#148;&#151;here she showed her 
student what she meant&#151;&#147;of the incense and toss it into the fire.  The 
closer to the center that you can get your incense, the better your 
efforts will be rewarded.&#148;

ChibiUsa lobbed the incense into the fire.  She thought that she might 
have thrown a little too far to the right, but Rei didn&#146;t remark on 
her aim.

&#147;Okay, get your fan and use it to make the fire grow a little.  Don&#146;t 
worry about the smoke; the fire is what we&#146;re concerned with.&#148;

&#147;How&#146;s this?&#148; ChibiUsa asked.

&#147;Very good, just go a little more slowly.  There.  Next, set down the 
fan and place your hands on your legs like this&#151;that&#146;s right&#151;and close 
your eyes.  Don&#146;t open your eyelids until you&#146;ve finished asking your 
question.&#148;

&#147;And how do I do that?&#148;

&#147;Do what?&#148;

&#147;Ask the question?&#148;

Rei tried&#151;really, honestly tried&#151;to hold back her laughter and was 
almost successful.  &#147;Just like you&#146;d ask anyone a question,&#148; she 
chuckled.  &#147;How did you think you&#146;d ask?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know; I guess I thought&#133;I could just think the question&#133;or&#133;&#148; 
ChibiUsa trailed away, feeling stupid.

&#147;I didn&#146;t mean to laugh,&#148; Rei said contritely.

&#147;No, it&#146;s okay.  I know you weren&#146;t laughing at me.  But I did sound 
pretty dumb, huh?&#148;

&#147;Definitely not!  It was a fair question.  If anything, I should have 
clarified.

&#147;When you talk to the fire, it&#146;s best to quickly get rid of as many 
distractions as you can, then speak clearly, and try to watch your 
wording.  Ideally, the time from setting down the fan to finishing the 
question should be fifteen seconds or less.&#148;

&#147;Oh.  I guess I&#146;m out of my window already.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s no big deal.  Just toss in a little more incense, do your 
fanning, and ask your question.  The fire isn&#146;t particularly finicky.

&#147;So, are you ready to give it another go?&#148;

&#147;I think so.&#148;  ChibiUsa grabbed a small amount of incense and pitched 
it into the fire.  Then she fanned the flames once more.  Her motions 
were smoother this time.  She closed her eyes.  &#147;Am I going to have a 
date for the winter formal dance?&#148;

Rei couldn&#146;t believe her ears, but she kept her mouth shut.  Had she 
ever asked such a frivolous question, even in her youth?  Or maybe she 
was being too harsh; socializing had never meant as much to her as it 
did to ChibiUsa.

Speaking of ChibiUsa, her eyes were opened and she was smiling 
delightedly at Rei.

&#147;I take it you got a &#145;yes&#146;,&#148; Rei said.

The pink-haired girl looked puzzled.  &#147;You mean you didn&#146;t hear it 
too?  Did I imagine it?&#148;

&#147;Only the person who asks the question hears the answer.&#148;

&#147;Really?  You&#146;re so good at this, I figured you must have heard it 
too.  That&#146;s interesting.&#148;

&#147;Okay, now that you&#146;ve learned how to inquire, let&#146;s take a break.  
Would you care for some tea, Princess?&#148;

I love it when she calls me that, ChibiUsa thought.  Of course, 
everyone does, but coming from her it sounds so wonderful.  &#147;What I&#146;d 
really like is some hot cocoa, if you have any.&#148;

&#147;I thought you&#146;d have outgrown that by now,&#148; Rei kidded.  &#147;Luckily, I 
always have some on hand for visits from you or your mother.&#148;

ChibiUsa sweatdropped.  &#147;I didn&#146;t think the queen still drank cocoa,&#148; 
she sputtered.

&#147;Her greatest love is her family, but her first love is sweets,&#148; the 
purple-eyed woman said with a pretty smile.  &#147;It&#146;s one of the things 
that makes her, her&#133;&#148; She looked deep into ChibiUsa&#146;s eyes with a 
fond, warm expression.  &#147;&#133;And you, you.&#148;

While Rei was fixing the drinks, ChibiUsa stared into the roaring 
fire.  &#147;You will attend the dance with the one you love best,&#148; that 
was what the fire had told her.  It sounded perfect when she first 
heard it, but now the red-eyed girl frowned slightly.  Who was it?  
She knew whom she cared about&#133;but love?  The mysterious force had 
hidden itself from her for sixteen years.  Perhaps I should ask the 
fire who I&#146;m going with to the dance, she thought.  But just before 
she approached to ask, Rei arrived with the hot beverages.

&#147;Here you go,&#148; Rei said, setting the steaming mug in front of her 
guest.  &#147;So it was pretty easy, wasn&#146;t it?&#148;

&#147;Hmm?  Oh yes, you were right.&#148;  ChibiUsa idly swirled the cocoa in 
her mug.

&#147;What is it?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know.  Is the fire ever wrong?&#148;

Now Rei was a little worried.  ChibiUsa had looked quite happy when 
the fire had answered her.  Where had this question originated?  &#147;In 
my experience, no.  But I almost never ask about the future.  That&#146;s 
Setsuna&#146;s department.&#148;

ChibiUsa nodded and continued to study her cup.

&#147;Are you all right, Princess?&#148;

Rei&#146;s concern lifted the young lady from her reverie.  &#147;I&#146;m fine, 
Rei-chan.&#148;  She flashed a winning smile at her tutor.  &#147;I just have 
more questions now, that&#146;s all.  I guess I&#146;ll have to make another 
inquiry.&#148;

&#147;Oops!  I forgot to mention that.  Gomen ne, Odango-chan; you can&#146;t 
ask more today.  For one thing, you&#146;re a novice.  You don&#146;t feel it, 
but trust me; you used a lot of energy a few minutes ago.  For another 
thing, certain astrological and meteorological events determine how 
well the fire will be able to aid us.  Conditions are pretty crummy 
right now.  I wouldn&#146;t have asked anyone else to make her first 
attempt today.  I just suspected that you could do it.  And you proved 
me right.&#148;

ChibiUsa&#146;s ears and cheeks went as pink as her hair at Rei&#146;s 
compliment.  &#147;I&#146;m glad I didn&#146;t disappoint you.  I probably only got 
lucky.&#148;

&#147;No.  That was talent.

&#147;But if you have more questions, I could ask them for you.  I have 
enough experience to make a few successful inquiries.&#148;

Some small part of ChibiUsa&#146;s subconscious mind forced her to decline 
the offer.  As nonchalantly as she could, she said, &#147;No need for that, 
Sensei.  I&#146;ll use the questions as practice.&#148;

&#147;Good for you, wanting to do things for yourself.  If I may change 
topics, who assigned that book you were reading earlier?&#148;

&#147;Minako did.&#148;

&#147;Oh?&#148;  Rei&#146;s mild curiosity multiplied itself.  &#147;That&#146;s unheard of.  
What&#146;s it called?&#148;

&#147;Hold on,&#148; ChibiUsa said.  She rummaged through her pack and found the 
book.  &#147;It&#146;s&#133;Destiny Versus Tendency: Identifying Your Soulmate,&#148; the 
pink-haired girl read.

&#147;That&#146;s definitely Minako-chan; if she was to assign a book, that 
would be it,&#148; Rei said.  &#147;But I still think it&#146;s strange.  She teaches 
via story or lecture usually.&#148;

&#147;Maybe the book was Ami-chan&#146;s idea,&#148; ChibiUsa theorized.

&#147;There are some things that can&#146;t be taught conventionally.  Ne, 
Chibi-chan, at least it&#146;s not a thick book.  You&#146;ll be able to handle 
it.

&#147;But let&#146;s get to our main lesson today.  The piano is in the parlor, 
as you know&#133;&#148;

ChibiUsa enjoyed her class.  After dinner, she recalled her earlier 
problem and decided that she should talk to her best friend about it.  
She called Hotaru and invited her to the palace.  In a few minutes, 
the dark-haired girl arrived.

&#147;Konnichiwa!  You sounded kind of worried, Chibi-chan.  Is everything 
all right?&#148;

&#147;Konnichiwa.  Yes, everything&#146;s fine.  But I&#146;ve got a question that&#146;s 
been bugging me.&#148;

&#147;Do tell.&#148;

&#147;I had Rei teaching me today.  So she showed me how to use the fire&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;She did?&#148; Hotaru exclaimed.  &#147;That&#146;s incredible.  You&#146;ve got to be 
only the third or fourth person she&#146;s ever shown.&#148;

&#147;I&#151;she&#133;Really?  No way!&#148;

Hotaru nodded, ending her friend&#146;s argument.  &#147;Rei-chan doesn&#146;t show 
just anyone.  I think that a lot of the time, she doesn&#146;t believe the 
person has what it takes.  She must think very highly of you.

&#147;But I interrupted.  Gomen.  Please continue, what happened with the 
fire?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.  Anyway, I asked if I&#146;d have a date to the winter formal, and 
it said yes.  It said that I would go with the one I love best.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s great!&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s where I need your help,&#148; ChibiUsa said soberly.  &#147;I don&#146;t have 
any idea who that is.&#148;

&#147;You want me to help with that?  How would I know who you love more 
than anyone?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re really smart, Taru-chan,&#148; the pink-haired girl flattered.  &#147;If 
anyone can help me, it&#146;s you.  Come on, this is important to me.&#148;

&#147;Hmm.  Why don&#146;t we list who you love?&#148; the black-haired girl 
suggested.  &#147;We can pick from the list once we have it.&#148;

&#147;Great idea!&#148;

&#147;Thanks.  Let&#146;s see&#133;I really don&#146;t know many of your guy friends.  
Start naming some off.&#148;

&#147;There&#146;s Fuji&#151;but I don&#146;t love him&#133;Jun&#151;no, I don&#146;t love him either; I 
just like him&#133;Kaji?  Hmm, no&#133;&#148;

&#147;Come on!  You must love someone!&#148;

&#147;Not really.  Now that I think about it, the only&#151;&#147;

ChibiUsa stopped talking abruptly.

&#147;Yes?&#148; Hotaru encouraged.

The young princess felt her blood boiling beneath her skin.  &#147;I&#146;m sure 
it&#146;s nothing, just a ridiculous thought,&#148; she fibbed.  &#147;But you&#146;re 
going with Hashiro, right?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s right, but&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;And have you got your dress picked out?&#148;

ChibiUsa kept her line of questions going until Hotaru finally gave up 
asking about the person the Moon Princess thought she might love.  She 
was sure that ChibiUsa would tell her eventually, when she was ready.

When Hotaru left for the night, ChibiUsa was tired, but she was still 
very curious and a little suspicious.  She couldn&#146;t sleep.  I might as 
well do something since I&#146;m up, she sighed to herself.  The ruby-eyed 
girl pulled out her assigned book and started reading where she had 
left off that morning.  Usually, homework put her right to sleep.  
Tonight, she became engrossed.  The book was relevant to her dilemma!

	&#147;One of the ways to identify your Soulmate is catching

yourself modifying your behavior.  If you voluntarily, perhaps 

even subconsciously, do your best for someone you know, you may 

be in love with that person.&#148;



Who did I nearly tell Taru-chan that I loved?  The Senshi, of course, 
ChibiUsa realized.  I love them all.  Particularly Ami, Minako, and 
Rei.  Especially Rei.

ChibiUsa&#146;s mind wandered.  Today, Rei had chosen her to learn how to 
read the fire.  She had been nervous.  She had succeeded.  If she&#146;d 
failed, Rei might not have smiled.  ChibiUsa adored Rei&#146;s smile.  She 
definitely had a grin that would light up a room.  Her dark eyes would 
sparkle, her inky black hair would shimmer, her cheeks would 
glow&#133;ChibiUsa did everything she could to make Rei smile.  Any effort 
would be worth the reward.

Kami-sama!

ChibiUsa dropped her book as she suddenly gained illumination.

It was Rei.  Rei was the one she loved most.  And though ChibiUsa had 
just realized it, she had always known it.  The confident, wise fire 
priestess held her heart in the palms of her hands.

Questions.  Doubts.  Worries.  Hopes.  ChibiUsa&#146;s young mind was 
assailed with emotions.  Could she possibly be right about this?  Or 
had the fire been wrong, perhaps?  Rei had said that it never had 
been, but there was a first time for everything, right?  On the other 
hand, she might simply have misinterpreted one of the many elements 
involved in this dilemma.

Whatever the case, she needed to talk to Rei.  Trying to solve this 
puzzle alone, with her tired brain already half asleep, was obviously 
futile.  Morning, she decided.

She shut off her light and went to sleep.

ChibiUsa woke the following morning with her heart pounding wildly in 
her chest.  Someone, possibly her mother, had once told her that 
dreams could foretell the future.  If the dream she&#146;d had last night 
was one of those, then she&#146;d be very, very glad that she told Rei.  
She&#146;d dreamed about Rei before, but never like that&#133;the young princess 
blushed at the though of it.

Rei had been doing a bit of thinking herself.  When she&#146;d seen 
ChibiUsa at first elated, but then troubled, it had struck her mind.  
Any problem of the princess&#146;s was her problem.  Rei tried not to worry 
about the pink-haired girl&#151;after all, who was more protected&#151;but she 
couldn&#146;t help it in this instance.  No one could aid the young woman 
in affairs of the heart.  Except for Minako, or Setsuna&#133;or maybe even 
she could, perhaps?  But what had made ChibiUsa anxious?

After she&#146;d turned it over in her mind for a few minutes, she guessed.  
If she asked the fire&#151;but no, she wouldn&#146;t.  She&#146;d already offered to 
ask.  ChibiUsa had declined.

Wait a minute.  Didn&#146;t the young lady trust her?  Rei frowned.  That 
thought really hurt.  Perhaps she should talk to ChibiUsa.

Someone knocked on Rei&#146;s door.  She hurried to open it.  &#147;Ohayo, 
Mina-chan,&#148; she greeted the blonde senshi.  &#147;Come in, please.&#148;

&#147;Ohayo gozimasu.  I&#146;ll come in, but I can&#146;t stay long.&#148;

&#147;Long enough for tea?&#148;

&#147;Yes, arigatou.&#148;  Mina took a seat on the long couch while Rei poured 
the beverages.

&#147;So what&#146;s up?  You&#146;re rarely in a hurry.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve got a favor to ask.  I&#146;m supposed to be teaching ChibiUsa today, 
but, er&#133;&#148;

&#147;You want me to do it.  Of course I will.&#148;

&#147;Rei-chan, you&#146;re the best!  Thanks!&#148;

&#147;So what did you forget?&#148;

&#147;&#133;anniversary&#133;&#148; Mina muttered, embarrassed.

&#147;Hmm?  What did you say?&#148;

&#147;I forgot our anniversary, all right?&#148; the blonde woman snapped.

&#147;You, the senshi of love&#151;you forgot your anniversary?  I&#146;ll bet that 
Ami&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;Okay!  What&#146;s the price of your silence?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m wounded.  I&#146;d never blackmail you.  But since you brought it up, 
I do need a little information.&#148;

&#147;Oh?&#148;

&#147;Why did you assign ChibiUsa that book?&#148;

A malicious smile scampered across Mina&#146;s features.  She quickly hid 
it.  &#147;I&#146;m just trying to help her see the obvious,&#148; she said in a 
sugary tone.

&#147;The obvious?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s in love.  I&#146;ve noticed, and by now, she may have understood it 
too.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s great!&#148; Rei announced.  Even as she spoke, she felt an 
undeniable pang of envy.  Wherever the feelings had come from, they 
weren&#146;t welcome; Rei hurriedly suppressed them.

Minako finished her tea.  &#147;Well, thanks for everything.  I&#146;ve got to 
run.&#148;

&#147;Hey, wait a minute!  Who&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;No time, sorry.  I&#146;ll see you later, Rei-chan.  I owe you.&#148;  Minako 
bustled out of the Shrine Wing.

&#147;People sure have been acting weird lately,&#148; the black-haired woman 
reflected aloud.  &#147;I&#146;d better go get ChibiUsa; she&#146;ll be wondering 
what&#146;s happened.&#148;

ChibiUsa heard approaching high-heeled feet as she had yesterday.  It 
was Rei again.  This wasn&#146;t her day to teach.  The pink-haired lady&#146;s 
throat felt dry, but her hands were suddenly sweating.  I&#146;m nervous, 
she realized.  I&#146;ve got to stay calm, or she&#146;ll know something&#146;s up&#133;

There was the knock.  ChibiUsa inhaled deeply and opened the door.  
&#147;Ohayo, Rei-chan,&#148; she cheerfully greeted.

&#147;Ohayo, Princess.  I&#146;m you&#146;re tutor again today.&#148;

&#147;Y-you are?  But it&#146;s Minako&#146;s lesson today.&#148;

&#147;True.  She has a prior engagement, though.  I&#146;ll be taking her 
place.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m almost ready,&#148; ChibiUsa said in a rush.  Her cheeks reddened.  
&#147;I&#146;m being so rude!  Please come in.  I&#146;ll only be a minute.&#148;

&#147;Is something the matter?&#148; Rei asked in confusion as ChibiUsa dashed 
to her room.

&#147;No, of course not,&#148; the young woman called back.  If Rei was going to 
be her tutor, she&#146;d have to look a little better.  She quickly changed 
her skirt from the usual white to a blue and red plaid mini that left 
much of her thighs bare.  The yellow blouse she was wearing was okay, 
but she undid two more buttons, letting it tactfully display just a 
little more cleavage.  She dabbed on a bit more of her citrus perfume.  
She carefully applied a thin coat of emerald eye shadow to her 
eyelids.

It&#146;s not enough, she thought, but Rei&#146;s waiting.  With a grimace, she 
headed back to her living room.

Rei&#146;s eyes widened for an instant when ChibiUsa returned.  &#147;You look 
great,&#148; she said honestly.  &#147;What&#146;s the occasion?&#148;

&#147;There isn&#146;t one,&#148; ChibiUsa answered.  Yet, she added silently.

&#147;I have an outdoor lesson planned today,&#148; Rei stated.  &#147;But we need to 
stop at the Shrine Wing first.  Are you ready to go?&#148;

&#147;You bet,&#148; ChibiUsa said, using her most charming smile.

The two ladies clasped hands and walked to Rei&#146;s apartment.  ChibiUsa 
grew more nervous and excited with every step.  When they entered the 
huge living room, ChibiUsa tugged Rei&#146;s hand, halting her.

&#147;Nani?&#148; Rei asked lightly.

ChibiUsa had to look away from the fire maiden&#146;s gaze.  &#147;I-I would 
l-like you to ask the fire a question for me,&#148; she stammered.  &#147;Who am 
I going to the dance with?&#148;

Rei looked kindly at her student.  &#147;You ought to ask yourself,&#148; she 
said.  &#147;And I mean, &#145;Ask yourself,&#146; not the fire.  You know who you 
love best.&#148;

ChibiUsa&#146;s eyes met Rei&#146;s shyly but determinedly.  &#147;Could you please 
ask?&#148;

Rei truly wanted to refuse, but she couldn&#146;t.  She&#146;d never been able 
to say no to the pink-haired girl.  &#147;Okay,&#148; she relented.  She 
gathered the fan and the incense and she and ChibiUsa knelt in front 
of the fire.  Rei tossed the incense and closed her eyes.

ChibiUsa turned to Rei and mustered her courage, waiting for Rei&#146;s 
eyes to open.  She swallowed hard and leaned toward the black-haired 
priestess.

Rei&#146;s eyes shot open in shock.  Quick as lightning, she felt 
ChibiUsa&#146;s lips pressing against hers.  The girl put an arm around 
Rei&#146;s waist.

&#147;Stop,&#148; Rei ordered, pulling away from ChibiUsa and standing in one 
smooth motion.

ChibiUsa was crushed.  Immediately, she began to cry softly.  Rei felt 
guilty and angry and confused and sympathetic all at once.  She hugged 
the sobbing girl tightly.  &#147;Gomen nasai, Chibi-chan.  I&#146;m not trying 
to hurt you.  I love you.  You know I do.  Please don&#146;t cry.

&#147;I&#146;m confused&#133;and scared.  I was in love with your father once, for a 
short while.  I was in love with your mother, too, for several years.  
And now you, their beautiful, wonderful daughter, show me that you 
love me.  What should I feel?

&#147;But that doesn&#146;t matter.  It&#146;s you I&#146;m worried about.  You&#146;re the 
Moon Princess.  You deserve someone strong, kind, and loving: someone 
better than I am.  Please consider that you may be mistaken about your 
feelings for me.  You are very smart, but also very young.  What seems 
like love at your age often vanishes.  I want you to avoid that 
mistake.&#148;

ChibiUsa&#146;s crying slowed but didn&#146;t stop.  She kept a firm hold on 
Rei&#146;s shirt.

&#147;Please don&#146;t cry,&#148; Rei begged.

&#147;Why are you so mean, Rei-chan?&#148; the ruby-eyed woman sniffed.  &#147;I do 
love you.  I&#146;m more sure of that than of anything.&#148;

The statement, the confession, broke Rei&#146;s fragile shell.  She started 
crying with her young charge.  &#147;How is this fair?&#148; she asked through 
her clenched teeth.  &#147;I gave up on love long ago.  I forbid you to 
love me!  Don&#146;t do this to us, Chibi-chan.  Hino Rei is not to be 
loved.&#148;

The miserable young ladies stayed hugging each other, crying, on the 
floor for long minutes.  ChibiUsa finally stood on shaky knees.  The 
women avoided each other&#146;s eyes.  &#147;I can&#146;t stop my love for you,&#148; 
ChibiUsa said quietly.  &#147;I&#146;m not going to try.  But you seem to enjoy 
hurting me and I&#146;m not going to stick around for that.  Sayonara.&#148;

The door slammed and Rei cried even harder.

Much later that day, ChibiUsa was sitting on her bed, thinking of 
nothing.  It was nothing or Rei, and that was no choice at all.  She 
wanted to despise Rei, but she couldn&#146;t.

Her door hinges creaked.  &#147;Get out!&#148; she snarled.

&#147;It&#146;s your mother,&#148; the queen called gently.

&#147;So what?  Just leave me alone!&#148;

Usagi held her daughter.  ChibiUsa had thought she was cried out, but 
she was wrong.

&#147;What happened, darling?&#148; Usagi asked.

Slowly, the whole story came out.  By the end, Usagi&#146;s heart was 
throbbing dully.  It had to be infinitely worse for her daughter.  
&#147;It&#146;s all my fault,&#148; the queen confessed.  &#147;I&#146;m so sorry.&#148;

&#147;No, it isn&#146;t.&#148;

&#147;It is.  I&#133;knew that Rei was in love with me.  All these years, I&#146;ve 
never said anything to her.  I avoided ever discussing love with her.  
So I haven&#146;t hurt just her, but you as well.&#148;

&#147;You knew?&#148; ChibiUsa shouted.  &#147;How could you be so cruel?  Rei is 
your best friend!  She doesn&#146;t believe that anyone can love her, and 
it&#146;s your fault!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;What good does sorry do?&#148; ChibiUsa pressed in anger.  &#147;It&#146;s about 
time you talked to her.  How can you be queen if you can&#146;t even talk 
to your friend?  Don&#146;t you understand that she feels worthless?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re right,&#148; Usagi said as tears streamed from her eyes.

When she heard the bell, Rei was nearly done packing her belongings.  
She ignored the caller, hoping she or he would leave.  The person at 
the door tried the knob.  Of course, it was locked.  Rei figured that 
would be the end of it.

The heavy oak burst apart before the queen&#146;s sword.  Rei didn&#146;t look 
up from the dress she was folding.

&#147;I thought you wouldn&#146;t mind if I let myself in,&#148; Usagi feebly joked.  
The fire priestess didn&#146;t answer.

&#147;Are you planning on leaving?&#148; Usagi tried again, noticing the boxes 
and the luggage.  Rei kept working silently.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.  I knew you loved me.&#148;

&#147;Shut up, your Majesty.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t leave, Rei-chan.&#148;

&#147;Why the hell shouldn&#146;t I?  I like to suffer as much as anyone, but 
enough is enough!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t punish her for my sins.  She is not me.  She is smarter, 
kinder, and&#133;she truly loves you.  I could never love you as much as 
she does.  I&#133;I haven&#146;t even been a&#151;been a g-good friend&#151;&#147; Usagi burst 
into tears.

Rei couldn&#146;t bear to hear her oldest friend crying.  Angry as she was, 
she embraced Usagi tightly and spoke comfortingly.  &#147;It&#146;s okay.  I 
forgive you, Usagi-chan.  You were in a tough situation, I know.&#148;

&#147;I never&#151;never wanted t-to hurt you.  I&#133;I just couldn&#146;t handle you.  I 
couldn&#146;t face you and tell you that I didn&#146;t love you; because 
I&#133;couldn&#146;t lie to you.&#148;

&#147;Telling me a while ago would have been nice; but I&#146;m glad that you&#146;re 
telling me now.  While I&#146;m gone, I&#146;ll&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;What?  You can&#146;t!  You can&#146;t leave!&#148;

&#147;I have to leave.  I&#146;m not ready.  I might never be ready.&#148;

&#147;Talk with ChibiUsa, please.&#148;

&#147;I hate goodbyes.  But I will.  I owe it to her.&#148;

For the third time in two days, ChibiUsa heard Rei&#146;s footsteps drawing 
nearer to her door.  The fire priestess was wearing sandals, but the 
pink-haired girl recognized her footfalls just the same.  The sounds 
stopped.  The silence grew longer.  ChibiUsa accurately pictured Rei 
standing in the corridor, hand raised, arguing with herself about 
knocking.  The young lady padded to the door and opened it, startling 
Rei.

&#147;Konnichiwa, Princess,&#148; Rei said solemnly.

&#147;Good evening,&#148; ChibiUsa replied.  &#147;I didn&#146;t know the whole story.  
I&#146;m sorry for calling you mean.&#148;

&#147;No, I&#146;m sorry,&#148; Rei countered.  &#147;I was mean.

&#147;Your mother visited me.  A lot of things she said made sense.  And I 
know that you are not her.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry that I didn&#146;t give you the chance that you deserved.  
Believe me, I know what it&#146;s like, to be denied that one chance.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry that I still can&#146;t give it to you.  Farewell, Chibi-chan.&#148;

Faster than a cheetah, ChibiUsa gripped Rei&#146;s upper arm and spun her 
around.  &#147;Don&#146;t you dare,&#148; she growled.  &#147;We&#146;ve already suffered 
enough.  I won&#146;t let you perpetuate it by leaving.

&#147;I don&#146;t care if you&#146;re &#145;healed.&#146;  I don&#146;t care if you&#146;re &#145;worthy.&#146;  
Aishiteru.  The only way you&#146;re leaving is with me.&#148;

It was impossible to say who initiated the kiss or, minutes later, who 
broke it.  Both senshi felt a bit lightheaded.

&#147;Aishiteru,&#148; Rei whispered.  &#147;Arigatou.  No one&#146;s ever told me she 
loved me.&#148;

&#147;Same here,&#148; ChibiUsa said.  She pulled Rei into her arms and kissed 
her again, deeply but gently.  She didn&#146;t linger on Rei&#146;s mouth as 
long this time, instead moving to kiss her neck.  She pressed her body 
against Rei&#146;s.  She let her hands slide down the fire priestess&#146;s back 
to her firm rear end.

&#147;Not yet,&#148; Rei objected, pulling back a bit.  &#147;I love you, but I&#146;m not 
ready for that.  I want to take it slow.&#148;

&#147;Okay,&#148; ChibiUsa said lightly, although she looked somewhat 
crestfallen.  &#147;I understand.&#148;

&#147;Will you go to the winter formal dance with me?&#148; Rei asked shyly.  A 
pretty blush painted her cheeks.

&#147;Of course,&#148; ChibiUsa laughed, &#147;if you&#146;ll be my girlfriend.&#148;

&#147;I can handle that.&#148;
