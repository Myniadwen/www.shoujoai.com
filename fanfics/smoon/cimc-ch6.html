<h1>Come into My Chamber (part 6 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;It begins today. And the  ending...it is eternal. There is no end.&quot;

&quot;Here, here! Very good, Milady.&quot;

&quot;To the blood...for it grants us eternal life...and eternal death. And to 
me, for I will grant humans the tranquil death they so richly deserve.&quot;

&quot;I am Serenity. I am Peace...&quot;
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;None of us really changes over time; we only become more fully what we 
are.&quot; -Lestat
 
What am I doing? Rei asked herself, staring blankly at the road ahead 
from her windshield. &quot;This is stupid...&quot; she murmured to herself, 
&quot;Insane...what am I, a superhero now?&quot;
 
&quot;You are special...&quot;
 
&quot;Dammit!&quot; Rei growled, thumping her hand on the steering wheel. &quot;She&#146;s 
probably some sort of monster...&quot;
 
Can monsters really be that beautiful? A voice in her head murmured. Rei 
frowned and shook her head, the teasing memory of Usagi&#146;s lips so close 
to her neck taunting her, offering soft whispers of what was to come.
 
&quot;Damn!&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Hunger.

The pulsating throb of blood intertwined, two hearts melding with each 
other to beat as one.

Only the body dies, the mind and soul lie eternal. 

And the heart.

Rich, crimson liquid dripping from the necks of victims, lovers, and 
friends. The mingled pain and pleasure of sharp fangs sinking into 
delicate flesh. And the heart, for a moment...the hearts beat in tune. The 
sweet melody of death.
 
Serenity sat on the ornate ebony throne, running her fingers along the 
smooth surface of the armrest. And she waited. Waiting was the most 
difficult, as always.
 
She had never been patient.
 
She sighed, shuffled, and stirred the blood in the wineglass she was 
holding with her fingers. Closing her eyes, and lapping the liquid from 
her hand, she briefly contemplated exactly how she would kill the 
detective. The all-too-familiar pang of guilt wrenched through her 
stomach before she forced it down. She gulped down the crimson liquid in 
the wineglass, and crushed the fragile crystal with her hands, watching 
in dull fascination as the wounds she had caused healed almost 
immediately.
 
She was starving. She had always hated waiting for her food. It was a 
very annoying, tedious process. The oddest thing was, she was not sure 
if killing the young investigator quickly would be the most intelligent 
of things to do. Usually, she preferred getting it over with. Killing 
had never been enjoyable for her, and she always made sure her victims 
experienced as little pain as possible.
 
But this time was different.
 
She didn&#146;t want the girl to experience pain so much as she wanted to 
extinguish her will. The bravado and obstinacy of the young woman was 
unbelievable. The sheer nerve, the gall of her to dare try to poke and 
prod her way into a realm she knew nothing about.
 
This would be a bending of wills. Serenity had never experienced 
such...anger before. What she was angry about, she had no idea what. 
Perhaps she was angry at herself for experience such unbridled hunger, 
such wanton lust for that silly little detective. She did not want her 
blood, she wanted her will, her heart, her courage.
 
She wanted her.
 
&quot;Do not worry,&quot; she whispered to no one in particular in the still 
darkness of the throne room.
 
&quot;It is only your body that dies.&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Ami, still shaken from the turn of events earlier, hoisted herself up 
from the floor where she had been shivering uncontrollably. Every ounce 
of logic was thrown out the window as her mind formulated one clear-cut 
thought.
 
There are vampires in Tokyo. An invasion of vampires.
 
Still nervous, weary, and confused, the good doctor mechanically walked 
to the hospital&#146;s parking lot, climbed into her car, and trailed Rei.

She doubted she would ever sleep again if she didn&#146;t get to the bottom 
of this mystery.
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
The sun had not risen yet, and Minako was restless, trying to clear her 
mind of the odd haze that had penetrated her psyche. The Queen must be 
very agitated, she thought, running her fingers through her hair. The 
blonde woman climbed out of bed, slightly surprised when she heard the 
crack of joints. &quot;Getting old, I guess, &quot; she murmured, going into the 
living room where she was sure Mitsuki still slept. The young woman was 
indeed asleep on the couch, and Minako took a moment to admire her. She 
looked so peaceful in sleep, her white hair tangled about her,  the 
swell of her breasts barely visible underneath the thin blanket, eyes 
hidden by sooty black eyelashes. Fenrir slept next to the couch on the 
floor, his breathing slow and steady, much like his owner&#146;s. Mitsuki was 
so beautiful that Minako knelt down and gave her a soft kiss on the 
lips. Her pale hand trailed along the girl&#146;s jawline, and she sighed 
sadly, straightening up and staring out the window. &quot;It&#146;s a shame that I 
can&#146;t be with you, Mitsuki,&quot; she whispered softly, closing her eyes 
tightly, &quot;but I...can&#146;t bear to change you. I&#146;m a monster...we...I don&#146;t 
deserve you. I wish...I wasn&#146;t like this...I wish that it was different.&quot;
 
She shuffled, and gave Mitsuki another kiss, feeling tears blur her 
vision.
 
&quot;...I love you...&quot;
 
And once again Mitsuki awoke with Minako nowhere to be found.
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
~Love?~
 
What do you want?
 
~You&#146; intend to kill her this time, don&#146;t you?~
 
Of course I do Setsuna. I am a hunter.
 
~But...I see. You are like us too, you know. You are a...contradiction of 
yourself. A fool among fools, love.~ 
 
Fuck you.

~Such colorful language, dear Kazuki. I&#146;m not going to let you kill her. 
You should return to us. You will be forgiven.~
 
I&#146;m shaking Setsie.
 
~Don&#146;t call me that, Kazuki. I hate that. You know it. Somebody&#146;s 
dealing with sexual tension. That&#146;s your...little pet name for me isn&#146;t 
it?~
 
...Go to hell.
 
~I knew it! I miss you...forget this silly little feud you have with the 
Queen. Calm down, relax. It will get better, I promise.~
 
I doubt it. Leave me.
 
~...Very well...~
 
The mind conversation ended, and the hunter known as Kazuki Nekura 
sighed and rubbed her temples, groaning in disgust. 
 
&quot;If Serenity wasn&#146;t such a complete fool, I would not have to kill her, 
Setsuna. I am...sorry.&quot;
 
The familiar jangle of her door chime was heard, and she lifted her head 
to be greeted by the detective from before.
 
&quot;Oh...this is just what I need. What is it Detective Hino?&quot;
 
The raven haired woman stared closely at Kazuki, frowning a bit. 
 
&quot;You&#146;re one of them...fuck...before I go...how many vampires are there in 
Tokyo?&quot;
 
Kazuki rose a finely arched eyebrow, and smiled grimly, showing her 
fangs.
 
&quot;More than I care to count, Detective.&quot;
 
A string of curses escaped the young woman&#146;s mouth, and she stormed out 
of the store, still huffing and puffing about &quot;fucking demon vampires.&quot;

Kazuki sighed, stood up, and cracked her knuckles. She had a feeling the 
detective would need her help. 

She really hated playing hero.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

She was here. 

Serenity smiled, and almost clapped her hands in delight. Hotaru ran off 
to open the door for her, and Serenity leaned back, smiling brightly, 
for once.

&quot;I finally get to meet you Rei...in my domain.&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

When the small girl who introduced herself as Hotaru bowed, and quietly 
welcomed Rei before leading her into the large mansion, the detective 
couldn&#146;t help but feel as if she was being followed.

She was of course, by Ami and Kazuki, respectively, but that was not all 
that was bothering her.

Her mind had run through a million fables that she remembered, and one 
line stuck in her head.

&quot;Come into my chamber,&quot; said the Spider to the Fly.

She was starting to feel like she was the fly in this particular 
situation.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Supremia: Suspense is lovely, isn&#146;t it?

Lulu: You are very cruel.

Supremia: I KNOW, right? Ahh, what will happen next? Lust, love, and 
hatred all intertwined, and the revealing of Serenity&#146;s sire in the next 
chapter of Come Into My Chamber. See you all then.

Both: Ciao.

Note: The conversation between Kazuki and Setsuna was NOT a flashback, 
simply a mental t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with each other. Just clearing that up now, 
in case someone got a bit confused.
