<h1>Mistaken Affection (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tung.html">Tunguska</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ah yes.another broken pathetic attempt at fanfic. Well, you&#39;ll find no 
youma here. Just a bit of interaction between two of my favorite 
characters. Bit of a warning, this will get depressing and angsty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mizuno Ami. She was the one who stuck in my mind. I knew the others and 
would call them friends, but she was different somehow. She seemed so 
compassionate, caring, genuinely concerned about me. I don&#39;t know what 
caused this. But it happened. I can&#39;t explain it. Ask her, she probably 
has a better grip on it than I do.

--Kino Makoto

The GroundWork

&quot;Now, this is how it works Mako-chan.&quot; Said Ami patiently as she explained 
again how the quadratic formula worked to Makoto. They were in Makoto&#39;s 
apartment, the others were visiting one of Usagi&#39;s relatives in Osaka so 
they decided to study without them. Makoto had suggested going to her 
place, with the Hikawa Shrine not an option her spacious apartment was the 
quietest place around.

&quot;Yosh! Thanks Ami-chan.&quot; Exclaimed Makoto triumphantly after she finally 
understood what Ami was telling her. Ami laughed softly and for some reason 
Makoto smiled broadly at that. &quot;Wow...Ami has such a pretty laugh,&quot; she 
thought to herself, &quot;she should really laugh more often.&quot;

&quot;No problem Mako-chan.&quot; Said Ami as she looked back to her book. They were 
done with the chapter they had been working on. Suddenly a low grumble rose 
out of Ami&#39;s abdomen. Ami&#39;s cheeks flushed slightly, &quot;Oh, gomen.&quot; She 
said, embarrassed by her body&#146;s unwanted noise.

&quot;Hungry?&quot; Asked Makoto.

&quot;A little.&quot; Acquiesced Ami. Without a word Makoto rose and walked to the 
kitchen. Once she was there it occurred to her that she had no idea what 
Ami liked to eat.

&quot;Hey Ami!&quot; She called to the other room, &quot;What do you want to eat?&quot;

&quot;Um, I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Ami as she stood and stretched her legs, &quot;normally 
I&#39;d just make myself some miso.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Makoto charged out of the kitchen with a bizarre look on her face. 
&quot;In the middle of the afternoon?&quot;

&quot;Is that wrong?&quot; Asked Ami meekly.

&quot;Oh, I suppose not,&quot; said Makoto while she considered miso in the middle of 
the afternoon, &quot;it&#39;s just I&#39;ve never thought of it as something you&#39;d eat 
during a study break is all. What kind do you like? I might be able to 
make some.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know, I just usually make whatever instant stuff we have 
around.&quot; Said Ami, noticing that Makoto suppressed a shudder at her words.

&quot;Well, I think I have the ingredients to make either a Kyoto or a Hatchou 
miso.&quot; Makoto said while drawing up a list of the things she&#39;d need in her 
mind. Ami&#39;s eyes lit up at the mention of the Hatchou miso.

&quot;The Hatchou would be great if you have the ingredients.&quot; Said Ami with a 
hungry smile. Makoto smiled back at her.

&quot;Let me go check, I think I have the right stuff for that.&quot; She said as she 
went back into the kitchen. Ami briefly considered following her friend but 
decided that by going into the kitchen she might be treading on sacred 
ground. A moment later Makoto emerged smiling.

&quot;Yep, I can have some Hatchou miso ready in a few minutes.&quot;

&quot;Wow, your amazing Makoto.&quot; Said Ami to the culinary wonder that stood 
before her. For a moment, she thought she saw something change in Makoto&#39;s 
smile. For the briefest of instants she saw something there in that smile 
that she couldn&#39;t place. Makoto went back into the kitchen and began making 
the Hatchou miso.

A few bowls of miso and some light conversation later Makoto was in the 
kitchen with the used dishes piled up on the counter. Makoto was just about 
to start washing when Ami entered the kitchen.

&quot;Need any help?&quot; She offered.

&quot;Sure, you dry.&quot; Said Makoto with a smile.

&quot;That miso was really good, a lot better than the instant stuff.&quot; Said Ami 
while she dried a dish. From the corner of her eye she saw that Makoto had 
the same look she had on when she had mentioned instant miso earlier.

&quot;Ami, you are never to eat instant miso ever again.&quot; Said Makoto coolly.

&quot;Sure thing Mako-chan,&quot; laughed Ami. The next few minutes saw Ami and 
Makoto wash and dry the dishes then put them away. Just as they were about 
to leave Ami caught sight of a small photograph that was held to the 
refrigerator by a magnet. She walked over to it and saw a four year-old 
Makoto being cradled in her mothers&#39; arms with her father by their side. 
&quot;Wow, so this is what your folks look like, you know I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever 
met them.&quot; She said thoughtfully.

&quot;They&#39;re in America on business.&quot; Said Makoto quickly as she left the 
kitchen. Ami saw that she had a very distant expression on her face. 
Something was up.

When Ami got back into the living room she saw that Makoto was already 
sitting with her book open and a pencil in hand. &quot;Makoto, can I see your 
folks room?&quot; Makoto froze.

&quot;I&#39;m not allowed in there.&quot; She said after a moments hesitation.

&quot;Well, just show me which room is theirs.&quot; Pressed Ami.

&quot;Look Ami, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nice to go looking at my parents private 
things.&quot; Snapped Makoto harshly. Ami swallowed loudly and looked away from 
her friend. She took a deep breath and sat down across from Makoto. After 
a few moments of reading Ami closed her book and looked across at Makoto. 
Makoto tried to ignore her but stole a few brief glances up at her blue 
haired friend

Ami stood suddenly and walked down the short hallway to where three doors 
were before her. One in front, one on the left, and one on the right. 
&quot;Well,&quot; she began, &quot;this one is your room.&quot; She said while opening the door 
in front of her. The door swung wide and revealed Makoto&#39;s unmade bed. 
&quot;And this one,&quot; she said while turning to her right, &quot;is the bathroom.&quot; She 
opened the door and flipped on the light. &quot;Yep, the bathroom.&quot; She turned 
to her left. &quot;So, unless you have some other secret rooms in this place, 
this must be your parents room.&quot; Her hand reached out to open the door but 
was stopped by Makoto forcing her hand away.

&quot;Ami,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;please don&#39;t.&quot; She let go of Ami&#39;s hand and her 
head hung low.

&quot;Mako-chan, you need this.&quot; Said Ami softly.

&quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;You do.&quot;

A closet. Towels, cleaners, various bathroom accessories, a camera, 
batteries. A closet. Makoto slumped against the wall and slid to the 
ground. &quot;You can&#39;t know this...&quot; She mumbled softly to herself.

&quot;Are you talking to me, or yourself?&quot; Asked Ami.

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Screamed Makoto suddenly. Ami jumped back from her friends&#39; 
sudden rage. Makoto was on her feet in an instant. She shoved Ami through 
her bedroom door and Ami fell backwards onto the bed. Before Ami could get 
up Makoto had straddled her waist and grabbed a handful of the front of her 
shirt. She pulled Ami up and raised her other hand in the air. Ami closed 
her eyes and waited for the blow to come. It didn&#39;t. Ami opened her eyes 
to see Makoto&#39;s arm had fallen, but her grip on Ami&#39;s shirt was still 
strong. Ami sat up and pried Makoto&#39;s hand off of her shirt.

&quot;Makoto, what happened?&quot; Asked Ami. Makoto began shaking her head slowly 
from side to side.

&quot;You killed them, why did you have to kill them?&quot; Tears began to build 
behind Makoto&#39;s eyes as a wave of grief and pain washed over her.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Ami asked again.

&quot;They were coming home,&quot; said Makoto as she choked back her tears, &quot;now 
they&#39;ll never be home. Why did you have to take that from me?&quot; She broke 
down after those last words and collapsed into Ami. She buried her face in 
Ami&#39;s blouse as sob after sob came wrenching out of her body. Ami put her 
arms around her friend and held her gently as Makoto cried herself to sleep. 
Ami wasn&#39;t too comfortable with Makoto&#39;s weight on top of her, but a bad 
nights sleep was worth seeing Makoto comforted.

&lt;&lt;&lt; The Next Morning &gt;&gt;&gt;

&quot;Ohayo Mako-chan.&quot; Said Ami as Makoto lifted her head off of Ami&#39;s 
shoulder. Makoto rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and looked down at Ami.

&quot;Ohayo...&quot; She said. She looked around her room and the slight twitch at 
the corner of her mouth betrayed her embarrassment over the situation. 
&quot;Gomen nasai.&quot; She said meekly. Ami wrapped her arms around Makoto and 
gave her a reassuring hug.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; she said, &quot;feel better?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I think so.&quot; Makoto stood and stretched. &quot;Umm, Ami?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ami stood up and straightened out her blouse and skirt.

&quot;Are you going to tell anybody?&quot; Asked Makoto cautiously.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; began Ami, &quot;I won&#39;t, if you don&#39;t want me to. But I think you 
need to be honest with the others.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Ami-chan. I&#39;m sorry this night was so difficult, I didn&#39;t mean 
to make you uncomfortable.&quot; Makoto&#39;s voice was small and weak. It was so 
unlike her normal tone that Ami barely registered that it was in fact 
Makoto&#39;s voice that she was hearing. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to get cleaned up 
and change. You can wait in the living room if you like.&quot; Said Makoto&#39;s 
weak voice.

&quot;Actually I think I&#39;m going to go home, I need to change and my folks are 
probably worried about me.&quot; The instant the words came out of her mouth Ami 
mentally slapped her self. She saw Makoto wince when she mentioned her 
parents. &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I need to learn to deal with it.&quot; Said Makoto with a stronger 
voice. The two said their good-byes and Ami left Makoto&#39;s apartment.
