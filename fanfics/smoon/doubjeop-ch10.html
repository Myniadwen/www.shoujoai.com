Morning had come to the land of the rising sun, with a reddish color to 
it, slowly rising into the sky. Long, thin shadows formed as light 
spilled through the streets between the buildings, bathing the city in a 
soft glow, as if to purify the city of darkness once again. That same 
light spilled into the bedroom of Makoto Kino, causing her green eyes to 
slowly open.

She yawned quietly for a moment as the gears in her mind started to 
crank up for the day. The realization that the previous night&#39;s events 
hadn&#39;t been a dream came to her as she took in her surroundings. She had 
fallen asleep in bed on her side, with her arm draped over Ami&#39;s waist, 
almost protectively. Makoto had let Ami borrow one of her t-shirts, 
which, on Ami, almost acted as a short nightgown. Her companion had 
fallen asleep with her back pressed against her, facing away. It 
reminded Makoto of Ami&#39;s lesson in Tai Chi from the night before. Makoto 
smiled softly as she took Ami&#39;s soft, slow breathing as a sign the other 
was still asleep. While the brunette didn&#39;t know it, it was also the 
first full peaceful night of sleep Ami had had in three weeks.

Then, as if sensing her tall partner was awake, Ami rolled over to face 
her, but kept her eyes closed. She wrapped her arms and one leg around 
Makoto, squeezing her as if she could somehow bring the other closer to 
her. As if admitting defeat, Ami&#39;s soft voice purred quietly, and 
despite its low volume, it seemed to fill the room. &#147;What time is it?&#148;

Makoto stretched her arms, then turned the clock on the nightstand a bit 
so she could read it. &#147;Almost eight thirty.&#148; Looking down at Ami&#39;s mop 
of blue hair, she said almost as if delivering bad news, &#147;Sorry, Ami, 
time to get up.&#148; Ami, for her part, pretended she hadn&#39;t heard Makoto, 
favoring trying to fall back to sleep again instead.

Makoto poked Ami&#39;s shoulder and Ami promptly ignored her. &#147;Come on. 
We&#39;re supposed to meet the others to go shopping in an hour. Haruka will 
be here soon to pick us up.&#148;

Ami opened one blue eye and regarded Makoto. Smiling, she said in her 
defense, still purring sleepily, &#147;Haruka is coming to pick you up in an 
hour. She doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m here.&#148; Ami paused a moment to yawn, then 
said, &#147;So there wont be enough room in that small car of hers for 
herself, Michiru, Setsuna, Hotaru, you, and me. My car is parked in your 
space, so I&#39;ll catch up later.&#148; Then she closed her eyes with a happy 
smile as if she had won the argument, hugged Makoto tight again, and 
started trying to go back to sleep.

&#147;Come on, don&#39;t be like that. You can sit on my lap.&#148; When Ami didn&#39;t 
respond, Makoto sighed and laid her head back down on the pillow for a 
moment, letting Ami think she had won. Then she said quietly, &#147;You know, 
we both learned a lot about each other last night.&#148;

Ami, sounding a little more distant and closer to her destination of 
sleep again, said, &#147;Mmm hmm. I found it interesting that you curl your 
toes when you are particularly enjoying yourself.&#148;

Makoto had to stop and fight her cheeks from turning pink at that 
comment. No, the previous night&#39;s events had definitely not been a 
dream, then. Once she had composed herself more, she said, returning to 
her strategy to get Ami moving, &#147;and I learned where you are ticklish.&#148;

Opening both eyes, and suddenly awake, the bluenette lifted her head to 
look at Makoto. &#147;You wouldn&#39;t.&#148;

Makoto looked into Ami&#39;s eyes and smiled. Nearly laughing, she said, &#147;I 
would, and you know it.&#148;

There was a sudden fury of movement and frantic rustling of fabric as 
Ami jumped out of bed. Laughing, she said happily, &#147;That&#39;s not fair. All 
I want is to get a few more minutes of sleep.&#148;

Just then, the radio alarm on Makoto&#39;s clock kicked on. Apparently, 
Minako was at work because her voice spoke over the radio in that happy 
cheerful morning person tone she used while at work. It fooled all but 
those who knew her most. Despite being a morning radio DJ, Minako was 
anything but a morning person. &#147;This is Minako Aino for the WKLTX 103.5 
Weekend Morning Show With Ritsuko, filling in for Ritsuko Hinokicho,&#148; 
she added angrily, &#147;who called in so she could go shopping! I&#39;m on to 
you, Ritsuko!&#148; Ami could almost see Minako in the studio, standing up 
shaking her fist in frustration.

&#147;See? Even Minako agrees with me. Time to get ready.&#148; Makoto said 
teasingly.

Then, remembering she was still on the air, Minako continued. &#147;Rise and 
shine Tokyo! It&#39;s a beautiful day! The celebration for the completion of 
the Tokyo Midtown Project is still underway. Sales are still on at the 
Dressterior, T-square, Beams House, Equation du Temps, in Touch, and 
more! Several of my friends are going to be there today.&#148; Finally taking 
a breath, she said, sounding a little disappointed, &#147;I wish I could be 
there with them, but no! I have to work! No rest for the best! Eh . . . 
I&#39;ll be going later today anyway, so nyah!&#148;

Picking up with her cheerful radio voice again, she continued. &#147;Well, to 
help those of you on your way to the sales, I, Minako Aino, will play 
Kiwi Love by the pop band Speed! Wow! That came out while I was in my 
senior year of high school! Well, now that I have dated myself for my 
viewers I sha --&#148; The radio beeped softly as Makoto clicked off the 
alarm.

Shaking her head, Makoto said, &#147;I keep telling her that people on the 
radio have listeners not viewers, but she still says that.&#148;

Ami shrugged and said, &#147;By now I figure she knows, and just does it as a 
gimmick. She loves to portray herself as the typical stupid blonde even 
though when she wants to, she can be quite clever . . . occasionally.&#148;

&#147;Speaking of a particular occasionally clever blonde, you have a 
suitcase with three days worth of clothing in it in the guest bedroom, 
packed courtesy of Minako.&#148; Makoto had told Ami about her visit from her 
double nearly three weeks ago now, but felt she didn&#39;t need to bring 
that little devil up at the moment. She hadn&#39;t even remembered about 
Ami&#39;s clothes until just now.

Ami walked over to Makoto, and put her arms around her, saying, &#147;Three 
days with you wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing.&#148;

Smiling again, Makoto said, pretending to be frustrated, &#147;Quit stalling. 
You&#39;re not getting back in this bed &#39;til much later in the day. Come on, 
we need to get ready or we are going to be late.&#148;

Sighing, Ami said, &#147;All right,&#148; and as she pulled away from Makoto she 
added, &#147;I assume you&#39;ll be there to tuck me in?&#148; As the two flirted 
shamelessly for a while, Ami couldn&#39;t help but think how normal she 
felt. How normal everything felt. Wasn&#39;t she supposed to feel different? 
Then she noticed that in a small way, she did feel different. She felt 
amazingly relaxed, comfortable, like nothing could ruin her day, so long 
as Makoto was with her.

After a few flirtatious comments back and forth between the two, Ami 
went to the guest bedroom and gathered her clothes for the day while 
Makoto went and brushed her teeth. After a few minutes, Ami walked in 
and found the sight of Makoto flossing her teeth to be amusing. Makoto 
just looked so undignified with her tussled hair, mouth opened as wide 
as she could, and her lips pulled back so she could see her teeth. For 
some reason it felt like the most ridiculous thing Ami had seen.

Makoto finally realized Ami was there, when she started to laugh. &#147;Is 
something funny?&#148; Makoto said, pretending to be upset. &#147;I can think of 
something equally funny.&#148; She picked up the container of dental floss, 
pulled out a section of it, and ran at Ami, who by this point held up 
her hands in self defense while she started to laugh again and tried to 
run away. For the first time in weeks, Ami seemed to be perfectly at 
ease to Makoto. It was a welcome change from her usual mood to see Ami 
happy once again. 

They were so preoccupied with each other as the two playfully ran out of 
the room, that neither noticed their reflections in the mirror had 
stayed right where they were, watching them as if they were hunting 
prey.

----------

Haruka had her yellow 2003 TVR Cerbera sports car parked next to the 
curb in front of the apartment building, waiting for Makoto. She was 
outside the car, leaning against the driver side door which had the 
window rolled down, flipping through an old car magazine and making no 
attempt at hiding her boredom. Michiru was sitting in the car on the 
front passenger side seat reading a romance novel. Hotaru was laying 
across the trunk of the car catching up on her homework assignment for 
her science class. They had already been waiting for fifteen minutes.

Not looking up from her book, Michiru said, &#147;You wouldn&#39;t have to wait 
so long if you wouldn&#39;t speed.&#148;

Lazily flipping to the next page, Haruka responded with a frustrated 
growling sound.

&#147;Speaking of which, you shouldn&#39;t speed when Hotaru is in the car. Isn&#39;t 
that one of our rules?&#148;

Haruka growled again. She had known that was going to come up.

Hotaru picked this moment to speak up. &#147;Don&#39;t worry, Michiru Mama, 
Haruka Papa only goes 24 kilos over the speed limit when she takes me to 
school.&#148;

Haruka looked up, originally intending to vent her frustration on the 
concrete wall in front of her. As she was doing that, the door to the 
apartment building opened, and her expression changed to one of 
confusion, then her lips made an O shape as realization dawned on her. 
Then a mischievous smile as she thought to herself, &#39;They&#39;re sleeping 
together! HA! Michiru owes me twenty yen! Then again . . . just because 
they are sleeping together, doesn&#39;t mean they are having sex . . . so 
maybe not.&#39;

Ami said cheerfully, &#147;Good morning, Hotaru,&#148; as she walked out the door 
behind Makoto. &#147;My homework assignment isn&#39;t giving you too much 
trouble, is it?&#148;

Hotaru, who had rolled over onto her back as she read, looked up, 
causing her hair to scrunch up a bit around her head. Seeing her teacher 
unexpectedly caused her to jump off the trunk of the car and stand up 
straight, as if it were the beginning of class. &#147;Good morning, Mizuno 
Sensei!&#148; Then she got a slight look of embarrassment on her face as Ami 
started laughing. She seemed in an unusually good mood today to Hotaru.

&#147;We&#39;re not in class, Hotaru-chan.&#148; Ami used the honorific to emphasize 
her point. When they were in school, Hotaru had to call Ami, Mizuno 
Sensei. When Hotaru had been assigned to her class, there had originally 
been some worry that Ami would show favoritism to Hotaru. Instead, Ami 
actually expected more from her than her other students, and was even 
known to lean harder on her. Still, when they were outside of class, Ami 
preferred Hotaru to refer to her less formally. It had taken Ami quite a 
while to get her to do that, and she wasn&#39;t about to let Hotaru get out 
of the habit, since Ami felt it mucked with standing and camaraderie 
among the Senshi.

Makoto, still nibbling on a piece of toast she had left over from 
breakfast, greeted Haruka. &#147;Good morning, Haruka. I hope we didn&#39;t keep 
you waiting too long.&#148; Then she leaned down a bit and waved at Michiru. 
Even though Michiru wasn&#39;t looking up, she still waved back politely, 
still engrossed in her book. &#147;Where is Setsuna?&#148; the brunette asked as 
she looked around. She was hoping to get the chance to thank her for her 
advice last night, and was a little disappointed not to see her.

Michiru replied from behind her book, &#147;She said she would take her car 
and join us later since she had a few things to do this morning.&#148; 
Finally looking up, she said, &#147;I&#39;m guessing now, her real reason was she 
knew there wouldn&#39;t be enough room. It&#39;s nice to see you both again. You 
both look rather . . . refreshed.&#148;

Ami blushed a dark crimson color upon hearing the comment, taking it to 
mean Michiru had taken a guess at the previous night&#39;s activities. 
Makoto didn&#39;t seem to notice, as she said happily as she finished off 
her toast, &#147;Yep! A good night&#39;s sleep works wonders for people.&#148;

Then Haruka said less cryptically, with a grin that could put a Cheshire 
cat to shame, and causing Ami to actually turn even redder, &#147;She wasn&#39;t 
referring to your good night&#39;s sleep, Mako-chan. Come on, we want 
details.&#148; That caused Makoto to turn a bit pink, and even Hotaru caught 
the meaning of it, clearing her throat quietly as she looked back and 
forth at Ami and Makoto.

Makoto asked a little shyly, &#147;Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a rather personal 
question, Haruka?&#148;

Trying to get Hotaru&#39;s mind off of what Ami was sure the girl was 
thinking she said, trying to sound confident and failing miserably, &#147;So, 
uh . . . what part of your homework are you on?&#148; It just seemed awkward 
to her knowing one of her students, even if it was one who was a friend 
of hers, was interested, or had any knowledge about her romantic life.

Hotaru, feeling a little awkward herself for the same reason, decided to 
try to help Ami save face and, to keep her from suffering more 
embarrassment said, &#147;You know what? I just finished it. How about we get 
going? I&#39;m told one of the stores in Midtown sells some rather 
interesting lamps I&#39;d like to add to my collection.&#148;

As their group got in the car, Haruka couldn&#39;t help but wonder why, of 
all things, Hotaru enjoyed collecting lamps so much.

The car ride up to now had been fairly quiet for the most part. Haruka 
was driving, and Michiru was next to her reading her book. Hotaru was 
looking out the window and watching the world go by, as was Makoto who 
had the other window seat in the back. Ami, squeezed between the two in 
what passed as the third passenger seat in the back, had taken the 
opportunity to rest her head on Makoto&#39;s shoulder and was getting a 
little more sleep.

Just as Minako&#39;s voice over the radio started commenting about the 
weather, they wound up having to stop for a traffic light at an 
intersection. Haruka was drumming her fingers on the steering wheel when 
she heard a car horn beep twice from the car beside them, then the sound 
of the driver of the next vehicle revving their engine.

Haruka looked over at the other car. That was the universal signal 
amongst street racers for &#39;Hi there, wanna race?&#39; There was of course no 
way Haruka was about to race someone with her family and a few friends 
in the car. However, once she got a good look at the driver, her eyes 
opened wide in surprise.

Michiru, not looking up from her book, said, &#147;Don&#39;t even think about it, 
Haruka.&#148;

Haruka, still surprised by who the driver of the other car was, narrowed 
her eyes and answered with the tone she used when she was looking for a 
fight. &#147;I don&#39;t think we have a choice in the matter.&#148;

Michiru looked up at Haruka, then she said, irritated, &#147;What are you 
talking about?&#148; Seeing her lover&#39;s expression, she followed her gaze out 
the window and saw what for a second she was sure was a trick of her 
reflection on the window. Then she realized what she was seeing. Michiru 
was seeing herself driving the other car, as well as the doubles of 
Haruka, Setsuna, and Hotaru, as passengers. Her double waved almost 
cheerfully, as Michiru made eye contact with her.

The moment the light turned green, the other car squealed its tires on 
the pavement, causing Ami to wake up. She couldn&#39;t see the occupants of 
the other car, but she recognized the familiar opulent blue pearl 2001 
Honda Acura RL almost immediately. Watching as the car flew forward, she 
said from the back seat, &#147;That&#39;s funny, that looked just like my car.&#148; 
Then, as she got a look at the license plate, she said loudly, &#147;Oh my 
god, that is my car!&#148;

Haruka wasted no time, slamming her foot down on the gas pedal, quickly 
closing the distance between Ami&#39;s car and hers. The blue Acura stayed 
in its lane, then slammed on its brakes, letting Haruka pass it, then 
sped up, switched into the same lane as Haruka, and rammed her car from 
behind, causing the lock on the trunk to break, sending it flying open 
for a moment, spilling some of the contents onto the road as it did so, 
then slamming back down and vibrating with every bump of the road. All 
of the passengers screamed out in either surprise or panic. Makoto 
looked over her shoulder and said angrily, &#147;It&#39;s them!&#148; Ami and Hotaru 
didn&#39;t need to ask who.

Michelle grinned, watching the reaction of the people in the car in 
front of her. Trista leaned forward and said calmly, as if giving advice 
to someone playing a game of chess, &#147;Ram them again.&#148; Michelle was all 
too happy to oblige as she sped up, and side swiped the rear left side 
of Haruka&#39;s car, sending sparks flying and nearly knocking the yellow 
car into a spin.

Haruka gritted her teeth as she fought to keep control of her car and 
said, &#147;Ideas, anyone?&#148;

As the car shook violently from a third impact, Ami said as she made 
sure her seat belt was fastened tightly, &#147;Just one! Head to Midtown like 
we were planning since the others will be there! We might be able to 
outnumber them if the ones in the car are all of them!&#148;

Haruka sped up and said, &#147;Good plan, but we gotta put some distance 
between us and them. I know a short cut, but it&#39;s risky.&#148;

As Hotaru watched the Acura closing in again like a shark chasing a 
fish, she said, &#147;Do it, Haruka Papa!&#148; Then she added with an edge of 
panic to her voice, &#147;Incoming!&#148;

The now-familiar sensation of being knocked around occurred again. Ami 
said, &#147;I think they want us alive!&#148;

&#147;What makes you think that?&#148; Makoto said, trying to stay calm. Dying in 
a demolition derby wasn&#39;t something that had been on her top ten list of 
things to do today.

&#147;They aren&#39;t using their attacks,&#148; Hotaru said for Ami. Just about any 
offensive attack from any of the Sekkou would be enough to take out a 
car in one hit.

The sound of the pavement rushing under the car changed as Haruka sped 
the car up and got onto a bridge. Their pursuers caught up again. This 
time Michelle slammed their car into the side of Haruka&#39;s, pressing the 
yellow car against the concrete barrier dividing the opposite lanes, 
sending sparks flying from both sides of Haruka&#39;s car.

Yelling above all the sound, Haruka said, &#147;You wanted me to take this 
short cut! I want you to know that, Hotaru!&#148; As the two dueling cars got 
halfway across the bridge, the concrete barrier had an opening in it so 
that emergency vehicles could turn around quickly if they had to. Haruka 
swerved her car through it, bringing her car just inches from the other 
barrier, then started weaving in and out of the traffic that was now 
going the opposite direction from them.

A look of fear crossed Haruka&#39;s face as she said, &#147;This could be a 
mistake.&#148; In front of them were two semi trucks in both lanes. Haruka&#39;s 
only chance of avoiding them was to drive between them and hope there 
was enough room for her car.

Michiru put both her hands on the dashboard and screamed at Haruka, 
&#147;Tenoh Haruka! This is insane! You&#39;re driving like an American!&#148; Then, 
to the passengers in the back seat, she yelled, &#147;Hang onto something!&#148;

&#147;They&#39;d be crazy to follow us, wouldn&#39;t they?&#148; Haruka yelled out, at the 
same time Michiru had told the others to hold on.

Ami had a perfect view of the two trucks in front of them and covered 
her face with her hands. She knew if either one, or worse, both, of the 
trucks hit them, seat belts and holding onto anything would not help. 
She had heard stories from her mother of what bodies looked like after 
being in a car versus semi truck accident and wasn&#39;t looking forward to 
being another example. Makoto held onto the back of Haruka&#39;s seat with a 
look of someone resined to their fate. Hotaru held onto her door, 
hyperventilating and looking for all the world (if it weren&#39;t for the 
child safety locks) like she would open the door and jump out. Their 
lives were in the hands of Haruka&#39;s driving skills, and luck now.

The yellow Cerbera slammed between the two semis, just barely fitting. 
The side mirrors went flying off, and about halfway past the trucks, the 
side windows exploded inward, sending glass flying everywhere, cutting 
into the occupants and getting stuck in their hair. Hot sparks rained 
inside the car, causing all but Haruka to close their eyes and turn away 
from the windows as best they could while fastened into their seats. The 
whole experience seemed like being way too close to a person cutting a 
metal sheet with a buzzsaw.

Then, just as quickly, it was over and they were alive! Fresh air blew 
in through the shattered windows, making it almost impossible at the 
speed they were going to hear what anyone was saying. However, over the 
sound of the wind and smell of burnt metal, rubber, and plastic, the 
sound of shearing metal and breaking glass could be heard as their 
pursuers&#39; car came flying from between the semi trucks at the Acura&#39;s 
top speed, still in hot pursuit.

Haruka swerved her car past a sport utility vehicle and watched in her 
rear view mirror as their pursuers&#39; car, its driver acting as if they 
were taking frustration out on the vehicle, side swiped the SUV, causing 
it to roll. Apparently, the Sekkou were not concerned about collateral 
damage or loss of innocent life. The sight of parts of the SUV flying in 
the air made Haruka&#39;s blood boil. It was time to stop playing around and 
take out the Sekkou once and for all, before they killed someone, if 
they hadn&#39;t done so already.

At the edge of the bridge, she swerved off the exit ramp, and then drove 
back to the proper side of the road the first chance she got. Watching 
as the car behind them did the same, she slammed on her brakes and 
jerked the wheel of her car so that their car came to a stop facing the 
opposite direction, causing the trunk to fly open and slam shut again. 
The Acura missed them by inches, but executed the same maneuver a moment 
later, not wasting any time to catch back up with Haruka.

Haruka smashed the gas pedal down as hard as she could, pressing 
everyone back in their seats, flying back up the exit ramp, staying on 
the outer part of the turn. Michelle brought her car up alongside 
Haruka&#39;s and was just about to try to smash them against the concrete 
barrier again, when Haruka gave her yellow Cerbera a violent jerk toward 
the blue Acura. Now on the bridge again, their opponent&#39;s car smashed 
into the wall. At the high speed they were going, the car became 
airborne, flying up and away from the bridge, small parts of the car and 
one of the doors flying off in every direction as it did so. Haruka 
noted that at least one of the Sekkou, the one that resembled Setsuna, 
got knocked out of the vehicle, flailing her limbs futilely as she flew 
through the air. Then the entire car, and the rest of its occupants, 
fell out of view, plunging to what Haruka hoped would be their deaths 
when they hit the hard, unforgiving ground below.

Haruka slowed the car back to a normal speed after swerving back into 
the proper lane and resuming their course. It was suddenly hard not to 
drive fast from the adrenalin still pumping through her. &#147;Everyone OK?&#148; 
she asked, still gripping the steering wheel so tightly her knuckles 
where white.

Somewhere after passing between the two trucks, Ami had put her arms 
around Makoto and was still squeezing the life out of her. Makoto, still 
trying to pry Ami&#39;s arms loose enough so she could breathe, managed to 
wheeze out, &#147;We&#39;re fine. Hotaru?&#148;

Hotaru was still holding onto the door, with her teeth clenched together 
as tight as she could, still afraid to open her eyes. &#147;Is it over?&#148;

Michiru said calmly and reassuringly, as she picked glass out of her 
hair, &#147;Yes, sweetheart, it&#39;s over.&#148;

Not moving, Hotaru said angrily, &#147;This is the last time I get in the car 
when Haruka Papa is driving.&#148;

Haruka shook her head a bit, finally feeling herself start to calm down, 
and let out a quiet laugh at Hotaru&#39;s comment. It had been a rush for 
all of them. Checking her gauges, she suddenly didn&#39;t want to know how 
badly damaged their car was. The gas gauge didn&#39;t appear to be working, 
and the car was severely overheated. Nearly every warning light, 
including the dreaded service engine soon light, was glowing on the 
dashboard. It was almost certainly going to be so expensive to repair, 
that they might as well buy a new one. &#147;Well, on the bright side, we 
took out four of the --&#148;

Haruka&#39;s words were cut off by a loud bang as a body slammed down on the 
hood of the car. At first Haruka had thought they had hit the enraged 
Dark Sailor Saturn. She must have landed in the road when their car went 
over the edge! Surely that was it!

Trista, Dark Saturn, welding her version of the Silence Glaive, slammed 
the sharp end of her weapon into the hood of the car, giving herself 
something to hold onto, and glared in at its occupants. Her long, dark 
green hair billowed around her almost like a cape.

Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Hotaru, Dark Pluto, slammed down on the 
trunk of the car, smashing in the back window with her version of the 
Garnet Rod, and reached in for Hotaru, wrapping her arm around her 
double&#39;s neck as she tried to choke the life out of her.

There were two more loud pounding sounds, as Ami guessed the other 
Sekkou that had been in her Acura crashed down onto what was left of the 
roof of Haruka&#39;s Cerbera like a hive of angry wasps attacking someone 
who had disturbed their nest. She reached over and tried to help Hotaru 
pull Dark Pluto&#39;s arm away from her neck.

Amara threw herself in through Makoto&#39;s window, landing on top of her, 
hitting her mercilessly and without pity repeatedly, at the same time 
that Michelle reached in and grabbed the steering wheel, trying to 
wrestle control of the car from Haruka.

Apparently, things were about to get even uglier than the car chase.

Author&#39;s note: In Japan, they say just say kilo for speed instead of 
kilometers, which is confusing because kilo is also associated with 
metric weight. For my fellow Americans, 24 kilometers is the equivalent
