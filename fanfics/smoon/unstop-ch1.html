<p align="center">Right, what do we call these? Drabbles? Yes, that  sounds infinitely better than admitting to being too lazy to string my  thoughts together into a proper story. Drabbles it is.</p>
<p align="center">First  off, they jump around a bit. Come now, lovely confusion. Secondly, this  is quite AU so don’t expect the other Senshi to show up . . . or for  there to be any Senshi at all.</p>
<p align="center">Off with you now. Shoo, go read.</p>

</p>
<p>Rei  drummed her fingers on the table in front of her, subtly wishing death  on her grandfather and anyone who came near. Alright, not Grandpa. Rei  loved him too much, for all that he was a misguided lecher. But <em>damn him</em> for making her sit at this damn booth in the damn mall waiting for  simpletons to wander up and ask for their fortunes. Every time a new  customer waltzed over, Rei resolved to predict their sudden, painful  death in as much detail as she could conjure. Each time, her conscience  got the better of her and she ended up telling them the truth about  what she saw.</p>
<p><em>Will my grandchild get better? </em>It’s just a bad flu. He’ll be fine in a few days.</p>
<p><em>Will my girlfriend say yes if I propose this weekend?</em> Yes, go for it. She’s been waiting for weeks.</p>
<p><em>There’s a dress over there on sale, should I buy it?</em> Of course not. It’ll make your ass look like a park bench. <em>Pardon?</em> It would be wise to continue searching. The best things in life are often revealed through effort and perseverance.</p>
<p>“¥500 per question,” Rei recited to her next client.</p>
<p>A ¥1,000 bill was handed over, slipped into the box beneath the table, and the girl took the seat across the table.</p>
<p>“What type of fortune telling would you like?” Rei gestured to the cards, crystals and candles set out on the table.</p>
<p>The girl shrugged. “Whichever you’re best at.”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded and set out the candles. She lit three of the four scented  candles and handed the matchbox to the blonde. “Ask your first  question.”</p>
<p>The girl took a thoughtful pose for a moment and then decided, “Am I going to pass the quiz we have this Monday?”</p>
<p>Irritated  at such a useless question, Rei paused and looked closer at the girl  before her. “You’re in my class.” The girl nodded. “You’re the one that  sits next to me and stares.”</p>
<p>Minako didn’t seem embarrassed at  all, just grinned. “What can I say? You’re nice to look at.” All she  received was a flat, annoyed look.</p>
<p>“Light the last candle.”</p>
<p>Minako  did so, put down the matches, and watched as Rei glanced at the flame  and closed her eyes for a moment. It was only a few seconds before she  looked back at Minako and said, “Nope. I’m seeing about a forty percent  on the next quiz. Have you studied at all?”</p>
<p>“Forty!? What? Aw, crap – I, well, not yet, but, eheh . . .” Minako gave a guilty little grin and scratched the back her head.</p>
<p>“That’s  pathetic,” Rei told her. She blew out the fourth candle and offered  Minako the matchbox again. “You get to ask another question.”</p>
<p>The  blonde fiddled with the little bow of matches. “I do have another  question . . .” She took out a match. “Should I break up with my  boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a matter of opinion?” Rei hardly found this question any more worthy than the last.</p>
<p>“Just tell me if it’s time to move on,” Minako specified.</p>
<p>Rei  sighed and gestured for Minako to light the candle once again. The  blonde struck the match, set it to the wick, and watched as Rei became  absorbed in the small, dancing flame. With a final frown of  concentration, the fortune-teller looked up. “You could stay with him  and be reasonably happy, but if you look elsewhere, chances are there’s  someone better for you.”</p>
<p>Minako sighed, “That’s kind of an iffy answer.”</p>
<p>With a scoff, Rei’s arms folded. “Well if you’re already considering leaving him, things can’t be that great.”</p>
<p>“So . . .”</p>
<p>“It’s time to move on.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>Sorry,  her friend mouthed with a shrug when Minako looked around and saw all  the nearby chairs taken. She was still panting a little from sprinting  to class – first day of school and she was already late. Everyone was  already settled and some of them watching her surreptitiously. The only  open seat was at the very back, second from the corner.</p>
<p>With a  little smile and a return shrug, Minako slipped through the rows to the  end and slid into her chair. She didn’t know any of the people sitting  around her. She wasn’t particularly interested in them either, until  she glanced at the girl to her left. Sunlight from the windows behind  her entered softly, shaded the angles of her face and made her dark  hair shine. Her profile was probably the closest to perfect that Minako  had ever seen.</p>
<p>The dark haired girl did not look over once during  the hour and a half where the teacher introduced himself, drew up a  seating plan and started reviewing their previous year.</p>
<p>It didn’t  really matter. It hardly mattered at all. In fact it was convenient  that she was isolated in this uncommunicative little corner. Someone to  talk to would only distract her. Better that Minako pay attention in  this class, as math had a habit of pile driving her average into  not-so-stellar regions. She had resolved that this year, academically,  would be different from the last, and the one before.</p>
<p>The dark  haired girl who did not look at her had amazingly stiff posture, Minako  noticed. Her back could not have been straighter if her spine had been  swapped for a steel pipe. Her arms were rigid too, braced on the desk  and set into unyielding shoulders. Only her hands, supple and elegant,  took part in any sort of movement. She wrote her notes in cursive.</p>
<p>Minako  glanced at the teacher every now and then, but inevitably returned her  attention to this girl. There was nothing amazingly different about  her, but she was captivating. Her uniform was clean and ironed. Her  shoes were dark and shiny; her hair was darker and shinier. It was  longer than her own, Minako realized. When she was ten, it had been her  greatest accomplishment – owning the longest hair in the class. She had  cried and sulked when her mother had trimmed her split ends off.</p>
<p>Minako  imagined touching that hair for a moment, and then figured that it  would not go over so well. The girl’s profile was very serious. Her  dark eyes focused ahead unrelentingly right until the end of class.</p>
<p>The  bell rang and the dark haired, stiff postured girl who did not look at  her slid her belongings into her bag and left. Minako put away her  books as well and reached to put away her pencil, only to realize she  had never taken it out.</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>Chatting to Rei was like  jogging up an escalator going down – maximum energy applied, minimum  distance covered. While she didn’t rebuff Minako’s attempts at  friendship, there was zero encouragement.</p>
<p>- Are you doing anything this weekend?</p>
<p>- Hopefully not.</p>
<p>She  seemed to have no interest in starting conversations and very little in  keeping one going. Back straight, scribbling away at math problems, she  hardly even glanced at Minako when she spoke.</p>
<p>- I don’t get number 23. Do we have to factorise it or work with it like it is?</p>
<p>- Maybe you should study your notes.</p>
<p>She  also seemed to have no qualms about being rude, though she didn’t seem  to go out of her way to be blunt either. There was very little Minako  could do to get reactions from the composed girl other than mild  irritation, though Rei would occasionally grow exasperated if Minako  asked enough pointless questions.</p>
<p>- Who would you rather be stranded on an island with, James Dean or Johnny Depp?</p>
<p>- . . .</p>
<p>-Young Catherine Hepburn or young Audrey Hepburn?</p>
<p>- . . . I have no idea who you’re talking about.</p>
<p>- Just say James Dean. You can’t go wrong with the hot, brooding type right, <em>Rei</em>?</p>
<p>- . . .</p>
<p>- <em>Right</em>?</p>
<p>- . . . sigh.</p>
<p>Slowly,  Minako began to wheedle details of her life out of Rei. She was a miko  at a shrine and didn’t watch TV, only rarely reading the newspaper to  keep up with the times. She scored well on tests, usually only a couple  marks off from 100 and wrote her notes in shorthand. She also turned  out to be rather self-conscious.</p>
<p>- Stop staring at me.</p>
<p>- . . . Do I have to?</p>
<p>- Yes, do your work!</p>
<p>- But watching you work is much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>- I’m sure.</p>
<p>- No, really. You make the cutest face when there’s a question you can’t solve.</p>
<p>- I . . . what? Never mind. Leave me alone.</p>
<p>- Awww, you’re blushing.</p>
<p>The  irritable student, though she preferred to settle into her own little  zone, always helped the blonde when she was having real difficulties.  She would touch Minako’s hand, take her pencil and lean in to explain a  concept. Then she would have to go over it again because the volleyball  player was distracted.</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>“Don’t pout at me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Stop it.”</p>
<p>“But, Rei . . .”</p>
<p>“No. I said no.”</p>
<p>“But  what if I fail? What if I fail this test and then fail this course and  I end up never going anywhere in life, living penniless and alone,  working street corners and selling my babies for –”</p>
<p>“Shh. I’m trying to work. Maybe if you did the same you wouldn’t have time for ridiculous fantasies.”</p>
<p>“Please, Rei? I’ll be good, I promise! I’ll focus, and listen and be serious the whole time.”</p>
<p>“ . . . The whole time?”</p>
<p>“Eheh. Well, half of the time, at least.”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“ . . . But –”</p>
<p>“Yes, really! Just walk with me after school and we can study for the afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Rei!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p>
<p>“You’re so kind.”</p>
<p>“Unh-hunh”</p>
<p>“And smart, and funny.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“And <em>sooo</em> pretty.”</p>
<p>“You can stop now.”</p>
<p>“You sure?”</p>
<p>“ . . .”</p>
<p>“Because there’s more.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. Save it for later.”</p>
<p>“Okay! . . . Oh, don’t roll your eyes at me.”</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>“You’re  incredibly hard to get on your own, you know.” Rei’s tone was slightly  surly like she was feeling impatient. Minako wondered how long Rei had  waited for her to part with her friends.</p>
<p>She grinned in a way  that her mother always called impish. Minako preferred the term ‘coy’.  “Am I? And why would you want to get me on my own?” She held the door  as they exited the school.</p>
<p>She wasn’t really trying for an  embarrassed reaction and wasn’t too disappointed when Rei only snorted,  “Because I don’t want to go near your bimbo-headed posse. I’ve heard  idiocy is contagious in large, blonde groups.”</p>
<p>Rei didn’t even  flinch at the smack Minako dealt to her arm. “You’re just jealous!” The  volleyball player gave her a snooty look. “And besides, you could never  pull off blonde hair.”</p>
<p>“I guess I’m safe then.” Rei grinned but still shook her head. “I think I’ll keep my distance anyway.”</p>
<p>“You don’t really like big groups, do you?” Minako observed.</p>
<p>“Nope. Don’t do them.” They waited at a crosswalk for the lights to change.</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p><em>What about you? You tell me.</em> “You’re not a big group.” They crossed the street.</p>
<p>“So you’d do me?”</p>
<p>Rei  gave her a sharp look that turned into one of exasperation when Minako  started laughing. The blonde was always slipping quips like that into  otherwise acceptable conversations. Rei had found that a glare did not  seem to go very far in stopping the annoying girl’s giggles. “Lose some  weight and we’ll talk,” she muttered.</p>
<p>It shut Minako up as planned. This time, Rei did flinch when Minako screeched and socked her in the arm. Repeatedly.</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>“Don’t  I get the tour?” Minako prompted from behind Rei, tagging along with  the miko as she strode through the shrine grounds. They were both  slightly out of breath from the trek up the massive flight of steps  leading to the shrine.</p>
<p>Rei pointed and eloquently described, “Courtyard, shrine, home.” They stepped up to the sliding door and took their shoes off.</p>
<p>“Ah, lovely, lovely, I can see you’ve got a real future in pleasing patrons.” Minako jibed.</p>
<p>“Like your future in mathematics?” Rei returned. She led them from the door down a hall.</p>
<p><em>Touché</em>, the blond silently noted, and grinned. “Well that’s where you, my lovely assistant, come in!”</p>
<p>“I am <em>not</em> your –”</p>
<p>“Rei, is that you?” a voice called from another room. “Are you talking to yourself again?”</p>
<p>“I  do not talk to myself,” she muttered and turned into a room. Minako  followed and peered over Rei’s shoulder at an old man sitting at a  table, sipping tea. “I’ve brought a . . .” Rei turned her head, eyed  the blonde and settled on, “classmate over to study.”</p>
<p>“Ahh! I see, and such a pretty girl I see, too!” He squinted and gave a wrinkled grin to Minako.</p>
<p>“Grandpa . . .” Rei sighed.</p>
<p>“You  two behave! Off with you. Study, study . . .” His cheery smile never  faded as he returned to his cup of tea. “It’s nice that you’ve brought  a friend over, Rei.”</p>
<p>The miko sighed and led the way to her room.  Minako glanced sidelong at her face, expecting to see exasperation, and  was instead encountered with a strange, sad smile.</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go out to dinner with him, Grandpa.”</p>
<p>“I know you don’t.”</p>
<p>“I don’t even want to see him.”</p>
<p>“That’s perfectly understandable.”</p>
<p>“We’re  meeting clients, did I tell you that? He’s dragged me into this like an  amusing little sideshow for his stupid, loaded sponsors to distract  themselves with. They’ll stare and he’ll preen and then we’ll get in  the car and he’ll drop me off and I won’t see him for another five  months.”</p>
<p>“Pretty girls <em>are</em> always welcome . . .”</p>
<p>“I hate him.”</p>
<p>“Now, I’m not sure that you do, Rei.”</p>
<p>“I am. I hate him.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you going?”</p>
<p>“Because . . .”</p>
<p>“You could tell him no.”</p>
<p>“I hate him so much.”</p>
<p>“But not completely.”</p>
<p>“. . . N-no . . . but I . . . I sh-should. I . . .”</p>
<p>“Shh,  there now, don’t cry. He will come to his senses some day and see what  a beautiful, talented daughter he has and pay you all the attention you  deserve.”</p>
<p>“. . . And I will be sure to ignore him.”</p>
<p>“No you won’t. You are far more forgiving than you give yourself credit for.”</p>
<p>“ . . . I . . . suppose. Do you think he’ll like my new dress?”</p>
<p>“Of course he will . . . I paid enough for it.”</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>Seated  properly at the table, diligently completing her current math equation,  Rei resisted the urge to grit her teeth. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Just  looking around.” Rei’s room was neat and organized to the point of  seeming suspicious. Minako was nearly convinced that she would find  something disorderly <em>somewhere</em> if she searched in the right place.</p>
<p>“I  was under the impression you wanted to study, seeing as how your entire  future is on the line.” It was only through conscious, <em>strenuous</em> effort that Rei managed not to growl this small prompt.</p>
<p>Minako  seemed to sense her impending doom and skipped back to where her  binders and notebooks were sprawled about. She seated herself, took up  her pencil, and poured her focus into her work. It was only a matter of  seconds before her attention wandered once again. “Do you like living  in a shrine?”</p>
<p>Rei punched numbers into her calculator and copied down the answer. “Why?”</p>
<p>“I  think it would be cool. Everything is so ancient and you own so much  land – it’s like your own castle.” She grinned and poked Rei’s cheek  with the eraser end of her pencil. “Right, Princess?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s a  pain in the ass, actually.” Rei grabbed the pencil from Minako. “I  sweep the steps everyday in the morning before school and in the  evening before sunset. I clean the entire shrine room daily and tend to  the courtyard, and on top of all that I have to put up with swarms of  tourists.”</p>
<p>“So why do you live here if you don’t even like it?” Minako snatched for her pencil but it was held beyond her reach.</p>
<p>“I never said I don’t like it.” She dangled the pencil closer. “It’s not my choice anyway.”</p>
<p>Minako stopped reaching and turned to Rei. “Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because.”  Her throat felt very tight and she paused until she was sure her voice  wouldn’t give her away. “This is where my father left me.”</p>
<p>“And your mother?” Minako asked softly.</p>
<p>The  tightness in her throat welled upward somewhere behind her eyes and her  nose and threatened to push its way out. Rei looked away, got the  feeling under control, and gave Minako her pencil back. “Show me which  questions you have problems with and I’ll help you with them.”</p>
<p>The  blonde just nodded and flipped through her notebook, glancing at the  miko, who would not meet her eyes. They studied quietly for the next  half hour and Minako felt she may have actually made enough progress to  pass their exam. Rei told her not to get cocky.</p>
<p>Minako gathered  her books and put them away. “Thank you, Rei,” she said, seriously  enough that the dark haired girl knew she meant things other than  studying. The girl’s blue eyes were also serious for once.</p>
<p>Rei  considered thanking her in turn, but couldn’t reconcile the notion with  her pride. Her lips smirked. “You’re welcome. Next time, you’re paying.”</p>
<p>Then Minako grinned and all was right again. “Oh, I’ll find a way to repay you.”</p>
