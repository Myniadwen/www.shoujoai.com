<h1>Spice with a Pint of Life (part 6 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Minako&#39;s POV, Hikawa Shrine

Okay, I have to tell her about our concert...I fumbled my hand 
nervously, staring up at the shrine entrance. Somehow I decided that 
telling her in the morning would be best; she wasn&#39;t a rise and shine 
waker but if she&#39;s too muddled to completely understand then I&#39;d be safe 
for a few hours to the very least. Seriously I don&#39;t know if I could 
stand it if she wants to back out now...Would I be reduced to begging? 
The former leader of the inners forced to pleading? No, Rei wouldn&#39;t do 
that would she?

Again I forced myself to gulp.

&quot;Here goes...&quot;

I made my way up the stone steps, pondering upon the speech that I had 
prepared only a hour ago. It wasn&#39;t anything special due to the short 
notice, but imagine what Rei would do if I delayed the news by a day; 
she&#39;d probably go on a rampage screaming &#39;It&#39;s tomorrow!&quot; I winced at 
the thought; it wouldn&#39;t be pretty to see. Then again, I wouldn&#39;t be 
able to delay this anymore even if I wanted to. There was the set up 
rehearsal late this afternoon...And we both had to be there.

&quot;Rei, are you home?&quot; I called out, searching the grounds with a nervous 
eye. &quot;Oh well, guess she&#39;s not here.&quot; I said almost too cheerfully. As I 
spun to go, I ran into something hard, er, soft?

&quot;Mina chan? What are you doing here so early?&quot; A pair of amethyst eyes 
bore down onto me.

Rei...Gaaaaah, I don&#39;t know if I can do this, I started to panic. But 
she&#39;s here right now! Calm down, calm down, try not to look so 
flustered...My eyes darted up to see the miko staring at my peculiar 
behavior with a confused expression upon her face. The way she was 
looking at me so intently only made me more nervous; what&#39;s she 
thinking? Probably thinks I&#39;m a nutcase or something...I knew I 
shouldn&#39;t come here! How can I concentrate when she&#39;s around?

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; She put a hand on my shoulder, making me jump at 
the unexpected touch.

Eep. &quot;Y-yeah, just great.&quot; I lied. Yeah, I&#39;m peachy...

&quot;So why are you here? You don&#39;t usually get up this early, let alone 
coming here at this time of day.&quot;

&quot;W-well...I...It&#39;s about Manuke.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes flashed dangerous at the mention of the man&#39;s name.

&quot;Did he do anything to you?&quot; She almost demanded.

Both of her hands were on my shoulders now. Ouch! The grip was 
unbelievably strong! It felt like she wouldn&#39;t ever let go. But as much 
as I enjoyed the contact, it was kind of painful.

&quot;Rei...could you let go? That hurts.&quot;

&quot;...Ah, I-...Wasn&#39;t thinking. Sorry...&quot; She mumbled the last word. &quot;But 
he didn&#39;t do anything to you did he?&quot;

&quot;Nothing Rei.&quot; I thought I heard the miko sigh a breath of relief. &quot;He 
called yesterday and told me to tell you...&quot; I took a deep breath, here 
goes, &quot;...That-our-first-concert-is-in-two-days.&quot; I blurted.

As soon as the words left my mouth, my hands immediately came up to 
silence anything else I might&#39;ve said next.

Rei&#39;s face turned dark. I wonder what she&#39;s thinking...Nervously I 
shifted my weight from one foot to another, awaiting the fire senshi&#39;s 
reply. She was angry...That much I knew.

&quot;What...?&quot;

&quot;T-that&#39;s what he said.&quot; Please don&#39;t hate me!

&quot;That&#39;s...all...he said?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; I squeaked. &quot;There&#39;s a rehearsal later today.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; The miko fell silent. Come on Rei, don&#39;t let me down now. You 
signed the contract! I wanted to remind her of that but I didn&#39;t because 
I also knew of her temper. Immediately a wave of guilt washed over my 
weary mind; if she doesn&#39;t really want to do this I shouldn&#39;t force her. 
Besides...If things don&#39;t work out, there might be a next time right? 
It&#39;s...not like any of us are going to grow older. What do you want Rei?

Rei&#39;s POV

I&#39;m going to kill him! I&#39;m going to kill him! I&#39;m going to kill him! 
ARGH! He planned this on purpose that bastard! Probably hoping I&#39;ll quit 
now and leave Minako to his care. Well dream on buddy... But damn, this 
is a problem; I&#39;m not very good at last minute stuff. Even if it is a 
rehearsal, two days isn&#39;t enough for me to get any dance session or song 
memorized...I just don&#39;t have the patience to do that. Scratch that, 
patience for things I absolutely dislike.

I glanced over at the fidgeting blonde only to see her eyes never 
leaving my face. Oh...It made me groan inwardly. With her looking at me 
like that, how can I concentrate? Those puppy dog blues were really 
starting to take its toll on me, as though they were draining away my 
anger. I mean, how can you stay mad at anything looking at something 
like that?

I gave out a long sigh; this is definitely not my day...

&quot;What time?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mina seemed to perk up at that. &quot;3:30 p.m., down at the stadium 
behind their company.&quot;

&quot;...All right.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll be there?&quot; I was startled at how close her face at gotten to 
mine; it was too close, making me stumble back in surprise.

&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot; I turned away, trying to fight the blush that had risen up. 
Hopefully Mina didn&#39;t see that...

&quot;EeeeeEEee, ARIGATO REI CHAN!&quot;

From the moment I heard that high pitched squeal I knew it was coming; 
it was her flying tackle squeal.

Whap!

&quot;Oof!&quot; She had landed on top of me again. &quot;Miiiiiina chaaaan...&quot; 
Although I did know it was coming, I couldn&#39;t avoid it; she could really 
hurt herself if I let her fall. I felt her grip around my waist tighten, 
rudely awakening my mind to the situation at hand.

AH! Get off get off! My mind screamed. Too much contact. &quot;Uhh, I&#39;ve got 
to do some chores now, see you later!&quot; I wriggled out of her grip and 
ran off, not daring to look back to see the unavoidable confused look 
she probably bore.

As soon as I was out of sight and was sure no one was around I dropped 
onto my knees, feeling weakened. What was happening to me? My eyes 
searched the palms of my hands for answers. I could still feel the 
warmth of Mina&#39;s body embracing me still lingering on their fingertips. 
It&#39;s getting worse, that time I didn&#39;t want to just hold her...

&quot;I wanted...to kiss her.&quot;

What&#39;s this strange heart beat in my chest? Why do I keep blushing when 
she&#39;s close? Why do I feel like my day is complete when she&#39;s by my 
side? I don&#39;t understand! &#39;Oh, you understand. You just don&#39;t want to 
believe it.&quot; A voice in my head naggedDoes...does this mean I really 
l-love her? Or is it something worse?

Hino Rei or Mars, who am I?

Minako&#39;s POV

I watched until her raven hair whipped up and around the corner of the 
shrine. That was...a bit strange; normally she&#39;d get angry and scold me 
for acting without thinking. Come to think of it, Rei&#39;s had been acting 
strange altogether lately. There were times where she&#39;d be happy and 
cheerful one moment, then all of the sudden she&#39;d go quiet and refuse to 
look at me! Like now... Did I have something stuck in my teeth or what?

Hmm...I pondered on the possibilities as I walked back down the shrine 
steps. If there was something wrong, Rei should tell me! I can&#39;t help 
but worry when my friend&#39;s have problems, especially her.

&quot;Heeeeeey Mina chan!&quot; I looked up to see a familiar blonde calling me.

&quot;Usagi? What are you doing here? I thought you went home... N-not that 
I&#39;m not happy to see you but...&quot;

The other woman smiled, easing the nervous knot in my stomach. I was 
really happy to see her but she&#39;s been here for so long; wouldn&#39;t Darien 
be missing her and vice versa? How long was she going to stay?

&quot;Well yeah, I&#39;m just hanging around.&quot; Hanging around...? She makes it 
sound like it was a casual matter. &quot;You know, catch up on old times, 
taste test all the foods here.&quot;

I knew it...My eye brows twitched at the thought of a food crazed Usagi 
on the rampage.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? You were looking so down.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Rei chan; she&#39;s been acting weird lately.&quot;

&quot;Weird...?&quot; Usagi raised an eyebrow. &quot;Does she have a stomach ache? Or 
is it that time of the month? Don&#39;t worry about that, you know Rei&#39;s 
always grouchy.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;No...It&#39;s not like that.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Usagi had stopped laughing, a serious look had crossed her facial 
features.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I asked her. It was so rare to see our future queen like 
that; the last any of us saw that look was during our senshi fighting 
days.

&quot;Mm...Nothing!&quot; Her mood shifted again. &quot;Forget about Rei for second, I 
know what will cheer you up!&quot; She suddenly grabbed my hand.

&quot;W-what? Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;

Crown arcade

Sluuuurp!

&quot;Usagi, that&#39;s your fifth chocolate milkshake! Slow down will you?&quot;

My &#39;twin&#39; was just devouring those poor milkshakes...And here I thought 
I was the one who was supposed to be drowning my sorrows. What to do...I 
found myself searching the murky liquid of my own untouched drink for 
advice; it certainly seemed worth a try compared to asking Usagi in her 
frenzy state. But it didn&#39;t seem to be helping much either; I couldn&#39;t 
see anything. If only I had Rei&#39;s sensing abilities, like the way she 
could find answers by staring into the sacred fire. Wouldn&#39;t it make 
life easier?

I gave the shake a stir with a straw, watching the shades of chocolate 
swirl and meld into each other. We&#39;ve been fighting for so long, but 
even now we really haven&#39;t stopped. Somehow all of us are struggling to 
stay together...Makoto and Ami, Usagi and Darien, Rei and me...Until 
that day when Usagi takes the throne we&#39;ll be like this.
Ah, everything just feels so muddled!

&quot;Gomen nasai, I couldn&#39;t help myself.&quot; Usagi finally stopped. &quot;So what&#39;s 
this about grouchy Rei chan?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; I thought about my words carefully. &quot;There are times when she 
would be cheerful...&quot; Usagi&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;Yes, cheerful...Then a split 
second later she&#39;d avoid me like there was no tomorrow. Which reminds 
me! Do I have anything in my teeth?&quot; I smiled.


My companion shook her head. &quot;Nope, I don&#39;t see anything.&quot;

Huh...So scratch that off the list.

&quot;So she&#39;d just do all this for no reason?&quot; I nodded.

&quot;We didn&#39;t have a fight or anything, if that&#39;s what you mean. 
Although...she was pretty mad when she found out our first concert was 
in two days...&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe she&#39;s feeling a bit stressed. You know how she hates 
surprises...What did she do once she found out? Did she ignore you 
then?&quot;

&quot;Nope... Wait, actually, a bit at first...But then she agreed to show up 
and I sort of gave her a hug.&quot;

&quot;Then she ignored you?&quot;

&quot;She ran away!&quot; The memory was making my eyes sting, however, I really 
didn&#39;t want to cry.

I could see Usagi take the new information into consideration. &quot;You 
know...I don&#39;t think you should worry.&quot;

&quot;What? B-but why not?&quot;

&quot;Just trust me on this Mina chan. Perhaps what you really should 
concentrate on is your concert. Besides, don&#39;t you guys have a rehearsal 
or something?&quot;

Oops, that&#39;s right! We do. &quot;You&#39;re right! I better go home and get 
ready, got to choose what to wear and get the make up done. Thanks for 
listening Usagi, talk to you later okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you got it.&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV, later at the stadium

The place represented doom itself, the thoughts of what awaited me was 
unbearable. What does that jerk have in plan for us? Perhaps he&#39;ll have 
us dressing up as clowns and do ballet across the stage? Or maybe we&#39;ll 
have to sing something stupid like &#39;mary had a lamb&#39;? Yes, having him 
for a manager was almost as good as death itself; it definately didn&#39;t 
give you that warm and fuzzy feeling.

Then again...I&#39;d better watch it. Who knows what Manuke will do; there&#39;s 
a chance that he&#39;ll try to take me out somehow. If he&#39;s desperate enough 
to get Minako...

I walked down a large, white corridor until I found the stage entrance. 
For a moment I studied the handle cautiously, trying to decide whether a 
trap had already been set for my arrival. At the moment I didn&#39;t sense 
any bad will...but that doesn&#39;t guarantee it&#39;s absolutely safe; I should 
be on guard either way.

With that problem resolved, I twisted the knob and opened the door, 
finding relief that everything seemed normal. The stage was lying ahead, 
its brightly-lit area shining out of the surrounding shadows. Whew, 
almost there...I took a few heavy steps across the wood, listening 
intently for any other sound. However, there was none to my surprise.

&quot;Anyone here?&quot; I was now at the center of the stage, scanning the 
grounds for any sign of human life. Maybe I was expecting too much; I 
was early after all. The others may not get here for some time now...

Tup, tup...

&quot;Ah, what a pity. You arrived first.&quot;

I spun on the spot. Manuke!

&quot;What do you mean, &#39;a pity&#39;? Expecting Mina were you? Hoping to get some 
alone time?&quot;

He sneered, giving that &#39;how did you know&#39; glare. &quot;Better watch it; we 
wouldn&#39;t want any accidents do we?&quot;

I knew it!

&quot;Your definition of an accident is very vague, care to explain?&quot; As I 
said this, I crossed my arms; it gives a person a defiance pose.

We both glared at each other, neither willing to back down from their 
position. Whatever he had planned for me, I was sure I could handle. And 
if he even dared to hurt Mina he&#39;ll lose his life; I&#39;ve already informed 
him of that little fact. So...What will you do?

Slam.

&quot;Haa...haa...S-sorry I&#39;m late! Did I miss anything?&quot; Mina had arrived. 
&quot;Hey, why do you guys look so serious?&quot;

&quot;That...&quot; I started.

&quot;Nothing at all! You see, Rei &#39;chan&#39; and I were discussing our routine!&quot; 
Great, he&#39;s gone into his fake happy/stupid man mode. &quot;What do you think 
about dressing up as clowns and doing ballet across the stage? Hmm...?&quot; 
I twitched as the jerk put his arm around Minako.

&quot;Ballet...?&quot; The blonde pondered. Don&#39;t tell me she&#39;s actually 
considering it!

&quot;NO! He&#39;s just joking, aren&#39;t you Manuke?&quot;

&quot;...Am I?&quot;

&quot;Stop kidding around.&quot; Oh, he&#39;s going to pay for this.

&quot;But...Dancing would really make it unique wouldn&#39;t it Rei chan?&quot;

I blinked. It probably would...only all I can do is the waltz. Eh 
heh...The memory of the event came rushing back but I quickly fended it 
off.

&quot;Are you sure? I mean, wouldn&#39;t that take too much time? The concert is 
in only two days.&quot; I wonder whose fault is that? Manuke only smiled when 
I sent him another glare.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m sure. Manuke didn&#39;t tell you did he?&quot; My mind went blank for 
a moment. Okay, so what didn&#39;t he tell me? &quot;This one is the huge one 
Rei, it&#39;s a popularity thing; unless we make a big hit on our first 
appearance, we&#39;re not ever likely to do well later on.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Someone up there hates me.

&quot;Great, so it&#39;s decided! I just so happen to have the choreography ready 
to go. And no Rei &#39;chan&#39;, I didn&#39;t make it myself; our company paid a 
professional for this.&quot;

Then it couldn&#39;t be that bad...Could it?&quot;

But something told me that I was really going to regret those words.

Rehearsing

&quot;No, that&#39;s all wrong Rei! You have to spin and then twist. Try it 
again.&quot; Damn him, why won&#39;t that deceiver shut up? I&#39;m trying okay? It&#39;s 
just...not as easy as I thought it&#39;d be.

I looked over to my dance partner, who was pulling off the routine with 
precise perfection. Mina...is really good at this. I found myself 
staring as she rehearsed the exact part I had been. Her blonde hair 
whipped around as she performed the spin and twists with such grace that 
would have rivaled Michiru. It made feel content...just watching her. 
Then immensely guilty for screwing up so horribly at my own effort 
because I was supposed to be the lead!

All right, let&#39;s try again. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, 
trying to imagine the setting as if we were really performing. 
One...two...three. Mina would be standing on the opposite end of the 
stage. With one hand I reached out towards her, as if extending a far 
away invitation. The blonde was still singing, the mike in her hands and 
watching the crowd. Her gaze slowly turned until it finally came to rest 
on my own. My own voice made itself known, as if coaxing the blonde it 
was okay to travel the distance. Soft words...Our song... the one we 
created together started sad. It was one of loneliness, then it became 
one of searching.

Can you find the real me?
Somewhere here, dreaming somewhere, hurting everywhere
For a far off memory...

The stage lights steadily grow brighter, the audience holds their breath 
in anticipation. Officially the routine would become faster, the two of 
us becoming closer and closer until our hands finally meet.

Only...That&#39;s the way it was supposed to happen.

&quot;Yipe!&quot;

&quot;Oof!&quot;

Thud.

&quot;Owww...You really shouldn&#39;t practice with your eyes close Rei.&quot; Mina 
chan groaned. Somehow I had bumped into the blonde on the spin.

It was embarrassing, that was the only word for it. Okay, perhaps 
humiliating as well, nothing was going right! Every time I kept screwing 
up right where our hands are supposed to contact. Spin, then twist! Spin 
and then twist!

&quot;You really suck at this.&quot; Manuke &#39;kindly&#39; reminded me.

That did it. &quot;I&#39;m going.&quot;

&quot;What? Where to?&quot; Mina called after me.

&quot;Home.&quot;

&quot;But Rei, what about practice?&quot;

&quot;No need to worry Minako, it&#39;s probably time we stop; getting late you 
know.&quot; I could hear the jerk&#39;s voice try to assure the blonde but it 
didn&#39;t matter. Right now it felt like nothing mattered.

Slam!

Minako&#39;s POV, evening at the Hiwaka shrine

I can&#39;t believe Rei ran off again...

And it was sure nice of Manuke to excuse it and called the practice off 
early. If he hadn&#39;t I don&#39;t know what I would&#39;ve done; would I have 
chased Rei? It scared me, scarier than fighting any youma, demon or 
monster. Was it something I did? Why does it feel like we&#39;re growing 
farther apart?

I moved routinely up the steps, continued past the front gate until I 
made it to the shrine. The lights were still on, which meant, the miko 
must be still up. And by the looks of it, she&#39;s in her room at the 
moment.

Slowly and silently I moved across the outside boardwalk, groping the 
wall for balance. It was still a bit difficult to see, I don&#39;t know how 
Rei does it!

&quot;One, two, three.&quot;

I paused for a second to listen. Someone was counting, does that mean 
Rei is practicing?

When I finally made it to her room I slid the door partially to the 
side, just enough to peek through the crack. Sure enough, the 
raven-haired woman was reaching out, the beginning of the act I 
realized. Although it appeared Rei wasn&#39;t aware of my presence, it felt 
like she really was reaching out; her hand was facing my direction. 
I...wanted to take it.

And that&#39;s what I did.

&quot;What!&quot; Rei violently flinched backed from the touch, forcing her to 
step back. That kind of hurt but I suppose I shouldn&#39;t have been 
surprised; she did have her eyes closed, silly Rei.

&quot;Hey there.&quot; I cheerful greeted the shocked woman. And this time I had 
made sure there wasn&#39;t anything stuck on my teeth. &quot;Need a dance 
partner?&quot;

&quot;I-you...whaaaat?&quot;

&quot;Need. A. Dance Partner? Come on Rei, don&#39;t go blonde on me now!&quot; Oops, 
I just burnt myself didn&#39;t I?

Huh...

&quot;Yeah, I heard you, it&#39;s just.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t expect to see me?&quot;

She nodded. Okay, this isn&#39;t going to go anywhere with Rei leading the 
conversation.

&quot;Anyway, it seems like you have problems right when the music picks up.&quot; 
I was watching her this entire time after all. And personally, I don&#39;t 
think it would be too hard to correct.

Rei didn&#39;t nod this time, but instead looked away in an ashamed manner.

&quot;Yeah...I don&#39;t know what it is.&quot; She finally admitted. It always amazed 
me how she could make almost anything sound like torture.

&quot;Maybe you need the actual feel of it.&quot;

&quot;What do you mea-&quot;

Before she could finish I had pulled her up close to me, our bodies 
pressed tightly against each other. She made a small gasp of surprise 
and then... silence. I kind of like this silence; she looks so cute. 
Uhh, but I should probably say something before she gets the wrong idea. 
Not that it was a bad thing but...oh, you know.

&quot;Isn&#39;t this how we are when the music starts to speed up?&quot;

Rei mumbled something, but it was too soft. What did she say? I strained 
to hear.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;Not quite, I&#39;m the lead!&quot;

Eep! In one quick motion our positions had been shifted. Although, it 
didn&#39;t help to expand the distance between us one bit. It just...took me 
by surprise, but who cares?

&quot;Fine, fine.&quot; I flicked the grinning woman in the forehead. Of course, 
she immediately glared back, making me grin inwardly. Sometimes you have 
to remind Rei that she can&#39;t control quite everything. That everything 
includes me. &quot;Okay, from the top!&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV-An hour and a few crushed feet later...

&quot;Ow, ow, ow...&quot; I heard Mina complain as she walked back into the room 
in a pair of pajamas. We both agreed that she should stay over for the 
night; it was way too late to go out now.

&quot;Did the shower help?&quot;

The blonde dropped right beside me and gave me this really sarcastic 
&#39;are you kidding look&#39;.

&quot;I...guess that&#39;s a no?&quot;

Whap!

A pillow slapped me in the face!

&quot;Mina!&quot; I roared after the recovery.

&quot;Hai Rei chan?&quot;

WHAP!

&quot;Hey, no fair I didn&#39;t hit you that hard!&quot;

&quot;All&#39;s fair in love AND war!&quot;

Mina glared back, her eyes mere slits of ice. I wonder what she plans on 
doing now?

&quot;That so?&quot; She sweetly whispered.

That was definitely not what I was expecting. In fact, I expected her to 
throw the pillow this time. Instead she threw herself!

Wha!

Bump, thud!

No fair! No fair! Where was the warning shrill? &quot;That wasn&#39;t fa-mmpf!&quot;

Time seemed to freeze, taking me nearly forever to understand what was 
happening. She...we&#39;re kissing!

Her lips were very warm and soft, better than I ever imagined. Except I 
was still too confused to know what to do. That&#39;s where she came in 
again...

WHAP!

&quot;Got you Rei-chan.&quot; She giggled. So it was planned all along?

I tried to hold back a blush as I growled back, &quot;T-that&#39;s cheating!&quot;

&quot;All&#39;s fair in love and war.&quot; The blonde mimicked.

&quot;Ah...never mind! Just go to bed.&quot;

&quot;Party pooper.&quot;

I got up and turned off the lights before coming back to my own sleeping 
bag to find that Minako had somehow decided to put her sleeping bag 
beside mine. And I would&#39;ve argued against the idea but it was now 
impossible as they blonde had already fallen asleep. Now I know I&#39;m 
cranky in the mornings but this woman is ten times worse if you wake her 
from her &#39;beauty sleep&#39;.

&quot;Damn you...&quot; I whispered under my breath.

I found myself blushing again at the recent memory. She just did that to 
catch me off guard right? It&#39;s never going to happen again right?

I checked around the room to make sure no one was watching and then 
listened for any footsteps. When I found none, I leaned in and quickly 
gave the sleeping goddess of love a peck on the forehead.

&quot;Mm...night Rei chan...&quot; Instinctively I froze. But to my luck she 
merely rolled over and continued her slumber. Still dreaming as usual...

&quot;Night...Mina chan...&quot;
