<pre>Setsuna sighed as she continued to brush Usagi&#39;s hair. &quot;My princess,&quot; 
she murmured. &quot;Pharoh Endyimon only wishes for your happiness.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; Usagi whispered. &quot;my happiness is here. I,&quot; the pharoh&#39;s daughter 
paused to blush. &quot;I&#39;ve found her already.&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s eyebrows rose at that. &quot;This may be none of my business, but 
may I ask who it is?&quot;

&quot;Only if you promise not to tell!&quot; Usagi cried. Setsuna chuckled. &quot;You 
have my word.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s--&quot; They were interupted once more when a knock came from the door. 
&quot;Enter.&quot; Setsuna ordered. The golden door dwung open and one of the 
soldiers came in.

&quot;M&#39;lady sorceress,&quot; the long haired woman said, bowing her head low. &quot;My 
princess.&quot;

&quot;Ah, Rei.&quot; Setsuna greeted. Exotic eyes opened and the raven-haired girl 
stood. &quot;It is good to see you. I take it the army has returned?&quot;

&quot;Victorious.&quot; the soldier repliyed. Setsuna&#39;s eyes strayed to the white 
fabric tied tightly to Rei&#39;s side. A small patch of ruby was visable. 
&quot;You were injured?&quot;

&quot;Nothing serious.&quot; Rei reported. &quot;Minor flesh wound.&quot;

&quot;Oh Rei!&quot; Usagi gasped. She leaped from the bed and ran to the soldier&#39;s 
side. Her hands hovered over the girl&#39;s wound. &quot;You&#39;re hurt!&quot; she 
whimpered.

&quot;Ah, p-princess!&quot;

Setsuna giggled quietly behind her head. In all the years she had known 
the feirce warrior from the desert, she had never heard Rei stutter. 
Usagi grabbed the desert girl&#39;s hand and litterally dragged the girl 
around the corner and into the bath house. Setsuna looked around to make 
sure no one was watching before getting up from the bed and padding to 
the bath house. As she peeked in through the gauzy curtains, she saw the 
princess unwrapping her warrior&#39;s middle.

&quot;Rei, you&#39;re so irresponsidble!&quot; Usagi hissed. &quot;You need to be more 
careful! You got hurt and you could have been killed!&quot;

Rei shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m a fast healer.&quot; she said with a smirk.

Setsuna frowned. &#39;What are you hiding?&#39;

As the final bandage came undone, Usagi gasped. &quot;Wha--How--?!&quot;

&quot;What ever is the matter my princess?&quot; Rei practically purred.

Setsuna felt her heart flutter. While Rei&#39;s voice was a seduction all in 
its own, the added rumble made even the experienced sorceress fluster up 
a bit.

&quot;You--There&#39;s no wound!&quot; Usagi whispered. She turned her eyes up to Rei 
again. &quot;What magic is this?&quot;

Rei grinned cat-like. &quot;You want to know?&quot; Usagi nodded 
enthusiacstically. Rei looked her in the eye. &quot;Come closer.&quot;

Usagi leaned up an inch. &quot;Closer...&quot;

The golden haired child leaned forward even more. &quot;Closer...&quot;

Their faces were only seperated by a few scant inches.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Usagi breathed.

Setsuna found herself holding her own breath, completely caught up in 
the web of fantasy the two girls radiated. Rei chuckled darkly and 
grasped the princess&#39;s chin. &quot;It&#39;s this,&quot; she whispered before she 
sealed her lips over Usagi&#39;s.

Setsuna clamped a hand over her mouth in order to keep from gasping. 
Usagi&#39;s eyes widened before she closed her eyes and wrapped her arms 
around the desert warrior&#39;s neck. Rei grinned against her mouth and 
pulled the princess even closer.

The green-haired sorceress blinked serveral times.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; she whispered.

The sound of a door opening had Setsuna leaping up and sheilding the 
curtain with her body.

&quot;M&#39;lady sorceress,&quot; one of the pharoh&#39;s guards said bowing low. &quot;The 
pharoh has requested that her daughter attend the feast tonight.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Setsuna paused to think of a lie. &quot;T-the princess is preparing. 
She has begun her bath right now.&quot; She turned to the curtain and called 
out, &quot;Haven&#39;t you my princess?&quot;

There was the sound of a large splash. &quot;Yes Sorceress!&quot; Usagi yelled 
back.

Setsuna turned back to the guard. &quot;I see.&quot; he said bowing once more &quot;I 
shall inform the Pharoh.&quot; With that he stood and walked out of the 
princess&#39;s quarters.

The sorceress frowned and threw open the curtains. She then crossed her 
arms over her chest and glared at Usagi, who was naked and in the bath 
water.

&quot;You have a bit of explaining to do---&quot; then she noticed. &quot;Where is 
Rei?&quot;

Usagi gulped. &quot;Rei? What Rei? I know no Rei.&quot;

&quot;Usagi...&quot;

&quot;Uh, I think she, uh...had to g-go to the bathroom! Uh--that is, if I 
knew a Rei! Which I don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Usagi.&quot;

A rush of bubbles came from beneath the blonde.

Setsuna stared. The princess blushed. &quot;It wasn&#39;t me!&quot; she squeaked. She 
squealed as she was thrown backwards. Rei shot from the water, naked as 
well, as she gasped in one big lungful of air after another. &quot;What the 
hell Usagi!?!?&quot; she seethed as she turned to the blonde.

&quot;Were you trying to kill me!?&quot; she hissed. Usagi groaned and covered her 
eyes. The soldier blinked. &quot;What?&quot;

Usagi whimpered and pointed at Setsuna behind Rei.

Rei closed her eyes and sucked air between her teeth. &quot;There&#39;s someone 
behind me, isn&#39;t there?&quot; she groaned.

She turned slowly and gulped as she came face to face with Setsuna. The 
sorceress arched an eyebrow, not at all phazed by the raven-haired 
girl&#39;s nudity.

&quot;I can explain this.&quot;</pre>
