<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 23 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><p>“Luna. Artemis. It has been awhile.”</p><p>“Yes, it has. It’s good to see that you are 
doing well, Setsuna.” Artemis greeted in a cheerful manner. Luna, on the other hand, 
appeared to look somewhat grumpy. “Oh, and don’t mind Luna. She’s always like that when she 
first gets up in the morning.”</p><p><i><b>Whack!</b></i></p><p>“Ow!”</p><p>“I can speak for 
myself.” The woman huffed. Little did she know, but the familiar action almost brought 
Setsuna to smile.</p><p><i>Even after a few centuries, they’re still very much the same. 
</i>“It’s good to see that the two of you are doing well as well. However, there are a few 
pressing matters that we must attend to. Now that Lady Usagi and Lady Hotaru are both 
awake--”</p><p>“Wait. Did you just say...Hotaru?” Luna interrupted.</p><p>“Yes. I 
did.”</p><p>“But I thought...”</p><p>“Due to the circumstances, she has regained her senses 
and is no longer a threat to us.” The former advisor assured them both. With a simple 
gesture, she indicated where the two twins were sitting together. The sight brought a smile 
to Artemis’s face, but his partner still appeared somewhat apprehensive.</p><p>“I 
see.”</p><p>“Are you kidding me? This is great! I’m going to go and say hi right now!” 
Artemis was about to dash off, but Luna caught him by the collar of his suit.</p><p>“Work 
first, play later.” She remarked.</p><p>“Wha? Oh. Right...”</p><p>“Ahem,” Setsuna cleared 
her throat. “As I was saying... Now that Lady Usagi and Lady Hotaru are both awake, it is 
imperative that we re-establish the Kingdom’s Planetary Core Defence System before Apollo 
notices their presences. Do you think the two of you can handle it?”</p><p>“Of course.” Luna 
replied confidently.</p><p>“Leave it to us.”</p><p>“All right. After you have completed the 
task, I will fill you in on the rest of the situation. We should also be expecting visitors 
shortly.”</p><p>“Visitors...?” She heard the pair question behind her back.</p><p>Setsuna 
then shifted her attention toward the Moon heirs. The elder woman approached the two girls, 
and stopped a short distance away before she saw two pairs of contrasting eyes peer up at 
her in curiosity.</p><p>“Lady Usagi, Lady Hotaru,” She nodded to the newly returned Moon 
heir. However the dark-haired girl did not reply to the greeting and instead averted her 
gaze away guiltily. If the action had bothered her guardian, the woman didn’t show it. “It 
is good to see that you both have returned home safely. However, I am afraid that I must cut 
this reunion short. As I speak, Luna and Artemis are going to re-activate the Moon’s defence 
system.”</p><p>“Luna and Artemis? You mean they’re both all right?!” Usagi cried out. The 
girl must have sensed Setsuna’s foul mood because she immediately shut her mouth. “I’m 
sorry... I didn’t mean to interrupt you.”</p><p>“It’s fine... And yes, they are both in good 
health.” Setsuna replied, wearily. “As I was saying, they are both going to re-establish the 
shields. Until this is done, it is too dangerous for you to remain outside. That is why the 
both of you should return to the palace and take shelter for the time being.”</p><p>“But 
Setsuna--” Usagi protested.</p><p>“There will be time to discuss matters later.” She noted 
the crestfallen look and felt a twinge of guilt. “Forgive me if my requests are a burden to 
you, but there are certain criteria that take priority. The young woman over there, for 
instance, is one of them. As your guardian, may I request that bring the Martian, Lady Rei, 
into the palace with you? I will need to tend to her wounds at a later 
time.”</p><p>“Martian?” Blue eyes blinked back. Usagi followed Setsuna’s indicated direction 
until she spotted the motionless body of a raven-haired woman across the garden. She had 
nearly forgotten all about the stranger amidst the crisis they faced at the time. “Oh right. 
I remember her. She was the one who was holding up Hotaru’s barrier.”</p><p>The sudden 
absence of warmth from her side brought Usagi to look up to see Hotaru standing up to comply 
with their guardian’s wishes.</p><p>“I understand.” Hotaru replied in a soft, monotone-like 
voice. The woman kept her back turned to the green-haired woman’s watchful gaze as she made 
her way over to Rei.</p><p>“Hotaru...?” Usagi questioned her sister’s peculiar behaviour. 
Usagi’s eyes flew back when their guardian also turned her back and retreated towards the 
palace. “Setsuna...?”</p><p><i>What’s going on…? Is it just me, or do they seem a little 
cold to one another? Hmm...</i></p><p>“Usagi! Would you please come over here?” Hotaru 
called over to her.</p><p>“Oh! Yes, just a moment.” She stood up and ran over to where the 
girl was standing. “What is it?”</p><p>“I know this may sound strange, but will you please 
help me carry her? I believe it will take the both of us to bring her inside.” Hotaru 
requested.</p><p>“Ah, yes, of course. It’s not a problem at all, silly.” Usagi caught on. 
“Goddess forbid that I would allow you to carry her alone. She looks like she weighs a ton 
with all of that armor on. Do you think we should take it off first?”</p><p>Hotaru tilted 
her head thoughtfully. “I think... it would be better if we saved that for later. It could 
complicate things if we have to keep track of all of the pieces and I’m sure she would be 
upset if we lost something. From what I remember, she has quite the temper when she’s 
angry.”</p><p>Usagi bent down to pick up Rei’s legs. “Really...? So does that mean that you 
know her, Hotaru?”</p><p>“Well, I’m not quite sure if you can call it that. But I’ll explain 
it to you later, all right? In the meantime, where are we going to put her?”</p><p>“You 
know, I haven’t even thought of that. That’s a good question.”</p><p><i>Hmm...</i></p><p><u> 
(Minako, Space shuttle)</u></p><p><i>Rei… I hope she’s all right. When Hotaru suddenly 
vanished I thought I was going to a heart attack.</i></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p><i>Minako 
stood alongside with Ami on the upper floor of the bridge, holding Hotaru’s heart crystal 
close to her chest protectively. The Venusian was lost within her own world while her 
companions tended to one another’s wounds on the lower deck below. It hadn’t been an easy 
battle, but they all had made it out in relatively one piece. Now if only they could say the 
same for their two other comrades. Rei’s last thought transmission before the link was 
terminated worried Minako terribly, especially when Michiru informed them that the pair was 
no longer on Pluto. It wasn’t until Hotaru had graciously lent Michiru her spiritual 
signature that they were able to determine where their missing friends had disappeared 
to.</i></p><p><i>The blonde was about to let out a frustrated sigh when a warm light 
exploded between her arms.</i></p><p>“<i>Hm? Woah! 
W-What?!”</i></p><p><i><b>Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen…</b></i></p><p>“<i>The circumstances have 
changed. I must go on ahead.” A voice rang in the air.</i></p><p>“<i>Hotaru?” The crystal 
shone a purple light and lit up the surrounding area. “Wait! Where are you going? 
HOTARU!!”</i></p><p><i><b>FLAAAAAAAAAASH!</b></i></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p><i>She just 
disappeared, and none of us have heard from her since. Now instead of missing two people, 
we’re missing two and a half! What’s going on here?!</i></p><p><b>Bleep! Bleep! 
Bleep!</b></p><p>Everyone on deck halted in their actions once they registered the sound. Up 
where Ami was situated a screen on the computer monitor flashed yellow, indicating an 
incoming transmission.</p><p>“It’s an incoming message? But from who?” Haruka 
mouthed.</p><p>“I can’t identify the code.” Ami reported back.</p><p>“Open it 
anyway.”</p><p>“I’m already on it.” The blue-haired genius immediately hit a series of 
buttons on the main control panel and opened the line.</p><p><b>…</b><b>Channel 
secured…</b></p><p><b>...opening transmission…</b></p><p><b>Bleep!</b></p><p>Everyone was 
shocked when Setsuna’s face appeared on the overhead projector. Although the woman 
stubbornly upheld her mask of indifference, it appeared that she had run into her own share 
of troubles.</p><p>Haruka was fazed for only a few seconds. “It’s you! About time! Where 
have you been? What’s happened? And where’s Rei?! Is Hotaru with you?”</p><p>“We are all 
here, safe and sound. The threat has subsided and the injured are being treated as I speak.” 
The former advisor calmly stated.</p><p>“And...?”</p><p>Setsuna momentarily closed her eyes 
in thought.</p><p>“There is much that I wish to discuss with you all. However, I would 
recommend that you take some concern for your own well being and concentrate on reaching 
here safely. I will provide a map for you. Please hurry.”</p><p>“What? Can’t you just tell 
us over the—Oh for!!” Haruka cursed as Setsuna abruptly terminated the link. “That damn 
woman thinks she can do whatever she wants! She wants a talk? Oh, then she’ll get a talk! 
Everyone, if you need me I’ll be in my room. Tell me when we reach wherever she wants us to 
be.”</p><p>Minako observed from a distance as the wind ruler stormed out of the bridge. She 
couldn’t comment much on the other blonde’s attitude, but she secretly felt relieved knowing 
that there weren’t any casualties.</p><p><i>She said that everyone was safe and sound. Then 
that mean, that Rei must be all right. But knowing her, she’s probably all bruised and 
battered again. I can almost see it right now. She’s just so reckless 
sometimes...</i></p><p>Minako allowed herself a small smile at the thought. She couldn’t 
wait to get to the Moon now; not only would it be her first time visiting there but she was 
also going to see her friend again.</p><p><i>Heh. You know, I can’t stop thinking about 
it...but that battle on Saturn was really something else. It felt like she was right there 
with me the entire way... watching my back, watching out for me in general. It felt like she 
was really concerned about me. </i>She couldn’t deny that she had liked the comfort that she 
felt. It had been nice. <i>But...I can’t keep leaning on her forever. Honestly, it scares me 
a little. Lately, when I’m with her...it’s like, I forget about everything that worries me. 
Even after I lost my family, it didn’t hurt as much as I thought it would. If this keeps up, 
then I just might... </i></p><p><i>No. Rei is just a friend and nothing more. The war is all 
that matters now. </i>The young woman continued to repeat the mantra despite the painful tug 
on her heart. <i>All that matters… is winning.</i></p><p><u>(Usagi, Moon 
Kingdom)</u></p><p><b>Click.</b></p><p>Usagi closed the bedroom door behind her and sighed 
in relief.</p><p>“Whew. I never expected her to be so heavy... It’s a good thing that we had 
one of these spare rooms handy, huh, Hotaru?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>When her sibling didn’t 
reply, Usagi realized that her sister was in no mood to joke. Past the bed where they had 
laid the Martian down, Hotaru was leaning against a wall beside the terrace and was staring 
outside the balcony. She seemed to be preoccupied about something.</p><p>“Did you find 
something interesting to look at?” Usagi gently asked as she approached the balcony. “You’ve 
been staring out of this window for some time now.”</p><p>Hotaru’s dark eyes flickered back 
to her twin long enough to understand that the woman had stopped right beside her. Although 
Usagi acted casually, she knew that she was only pretending to be interested in the 
view.</p><p>The dark-haired girl shrugged, but offered no reply.</p><p>“Glad to be home?” 
The question seemed to have caught Hotaru off-guard. Usagi watched her reaction intently, 
but decided not to push it. “You know, if you’re tired, you can go back to our room and 
rest. I can stay here and watch our patient until she wakes 
up.”</p><p>“...Usagi.”</p><p>“It’s not a problem, really!” She grinned. “Besides, I’ve been 
asleep for awhile. I think I’d like to stay awake for a little while longer.”</p><p>“Well, 
if you’re sure...All right. I’ll leave it to you then. Please take good care of 
her.”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>“Good night.”</p><p>“G’nite.”</p><p>But as soon as Hotaru left 
the room, the smile on Usagi’s face faded and was replaced by a sad expression.</p><p><i>Oh 
Hotaru...</i></p><p>A blast of light from outside caught drew her attention. Usagi whipped 
her head towards the window and squinted against the bright light.</p><p>In the outside 
hallway, Hotaru felt the energy surge as well. <i>So, they’ve succeeded in re-establishing 
the planet’s shield. She will summon us again soon...</i></p><p>When the light faded, Usagi 
saw a glint of light in the sky.</p><p><i>What is that? Is that...a falling 
star?</i></p><p><u> (Setsuna, Moon Palace, Audience 
Chamber)</u></p><p><i><b>Whup.</b></i></p><p>After dismissing everyone, Setsuna staggered 
into the Audience Chamber of the palace by her lonesome. Despite appearances her injuries 
hadn’t been quite as simple as she had hoped. Her muscles were so tense and sore that the 
woman was left hobbling and groping along the wall in the dark until she could go no 
further.</p><p>With a pained gasp, Setsuna threw herself against one of the pillars and 
allowed herself to rest.</p><p><i>Now that the planet shield has been activated, we should 
be safe for now… even if it’s only a little while longer. </i>The woman’s pupils constricted 
and she let out a string of coughs. With her eyes tearing a little she thought: <i>This 
isn’t good.</i> <i>It appears that I have expended too much energy. </i>She peered through 
the darkness at the familiar surroundings and felt herself become strangely reminiscent. The 
loneliness that had accumulated throughout the years suddenly came crashing down on her, 
amplifying the burden she had carried through the centuries.</p><p><i>...Serenity... </i>She 
could still see her smiling face. The memory rekindled a vow that she had made long 
ago.</p><p><i>No. I cannot rest yet. This battle is still far from over. There is much that 
I still need to do if we expect to stand any chance against him. </i></p><p>Leaning her 
weight against her staff, the woman began to concentrate on taking slower and deeper 
breaths. It helped a bit, since her energy began to replenish itself. A faint crimson light 
lit up around her body and began to heal her injuries.</p><p>Before she could stop herself, 
she thought: <i>It’s a good thing that the others cannot see me now.</i> The thought shocked 
woman.</p><p>“What am I thinking?” <i>When did it ever matter what others thought of me? 
</i></p><p><i>Between back then...</i> When she was under constant suspicion of being a 
traitor, <i>and now... </i>When she was under the assault of everyone’s accusations, 
especially Haruka’s and Luna’s,</p><p><i>...there is no difference.</i></p><p><b>Tup… 
tup…<br>Tup… tup…</b></p><p>The sound of approaching footsteps reached Setsuna’s ears. From 
the two auras in the lead the woman realized that Luna and Artemis were escorting their 
guests her way.</p><p><i>It seems that Luna and Artemis have found them. They have all 
improved to a degree, but it is still not enough.</i></p><p><i>To stand a chance against 
Apollo, they will all need to undergo strenuous training. The children still lack many 
important qualities that their former predecessors had possessed, and yet their mentors have 
all fallen. Keeping this in mind, and the uncertainty in the amount of time that we will 
have to prepare, a greater emphasis should be placed on our strategy if we ever hope to 
defeat him once and for all. </i></p><p><i>Come to think about it... when we defeated him 
all of those years ago, could it truly be considered a victory? Perhaps it was merely 
another prelude in this twisted maze of life. I wonder...This new path... will end in our 
destruction, or our salvation? It is strange, but as old and powerful that I am, even I 
cannot foretell this future.</i></p><p>The footsteps stopped outside the doorway, and 
Setsuna stood up and straightened her back. She then walked to the center of the floor and 
waited in anticipation as the doors began to open and light streamed into the dark 
room.</p><p><i>However...the new generation has an advantage that we did not have in the 
past. Now that Lady Usagi and Lady Hotaru have re-joined our ranks, perhaps...</i></p><p>As 
the Audience Chambers doors opened and a group of familiar faces walked inside, Setsuna 
could do nothing more but hope.</p><p><i>Now is it the 
time.</i></p><p><i><b>Creeeeeeak.</b></i></p><p>“I bid thee welcome. Please come in, there 
is much to be discussed.”</p><p><u>(Usagi, Upper Floor Bedroom)</u></p><p>After Hotaru had 
left the room, Usagi had pulled over a chair and sat down at her guest’s bedside. The Moon 
Princess was currently tending to the woman as promised; Usagi’s arms were stretched out 
over the unconscious woman’s body, palms down. A white light was being emitted from her 
hands. Everything the light touched was being completely healed at an unusually quick rate. 
It wouldn’t be long before she had finished the task.</p><p>“Whew. Done...” Usagi breathed a 
sigh of relief and sat back into her chair. She had to admire her handy-work. <i>I’ve got to 
admit, I still got it. </i>She smiled in satisfaction to herself. However, without anything 
to preoccupy her mind she soon found herself staring at the other woman in 
wonder.</p><p>“Well, how do you feel? Are you feeling any better?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Are 
you, having a good sleep?” Unconsciously, she reached out and stroked the woman’s cheek. Her 
blue eyes were filled with emotion. “It’s strange... I’m talking to you, but I don’t even 
know your name. My name is Usagi. What’s yours?”</p><p>When Rei didn’t reply, Usagi’s hand 
fell down into her long, silky strands and started playing with them.</p><p>“You know...I 
think this is the first time that I’ve met anyone my look at all the armor you were 
wearing,” she referred to the pile of metal on the floor. There were still a few pieces on 
Rei’s upper chest remaining. “Setsuna said that you are a Martian. So, that must mean that 
you’re from Mars, right? It’s kind of funny, because you remind me of someone else that I 
met from Mars. His name is Ares. Have you ever heard of him? They say that he’s the God of 
War, and one the strongest fighters amongst the Gods. I was just thinking... that you almost 
look like him. Oh! B-But I mean, you’re not as big of course, and you’re female... You’re 
also... a lot prettier,” she quickly added and was met by silence once more.</p><p><i>What 
am I doing, talking to her? It’s not like she can hear me.</i> <i>Still, even if she isn’t 
talking back, I do feel a little better. I wonder why that is...</i></p><p>“It’s really 
strange...” She wondered aloud. The woman absent-minded removed the last piece of Rei’s 
armor and was surprised when something dropped out. “Huh? Oh, what’s this?” Usagi picked up 
the pouch.</p><p><i>It’s light. I wonder what’s inside of it. </i>A thoughtful look crossed 
her expression. <i>No, I shouldn’t open it. It’s none of my 
business.</i></p><p>“Mm...”</p><p>Usagi blinked when the figure in the bed groaned and began 
to stir. She quickly stuffed the pouch into a nearby drawer. <i>Wait a second! Is she waking 
up already?! But her wounds—</i></p><p>Rei tried to sit up, but she felt a hand gently 
pushing down on her shoulder.</p><p>“Hey, you shouldn’t move around too much. You may 
re-open your wounds if you do.”</p><p>“What...?” The Martian opened her eyes and blinked 
back at the bleary face. “Why is the ground so soft?” She was surprised by the giggle that 
followed the comment. Rei immediately tried to bolt upright, but she yelped when there was a 
painful tug on her hair. “Ow! What the--?! What do you think you’re doing--” She whipped her 
head in Usagi’s directly, ready to shout out a string of curse words when she was stunned 
into silence.</p><p>Usagi was looking back at her with an uneasy expression, but Rei thought 
she was seeing double.</p><p><i>No way. It can’t be, can it? </i>“...M-Minako?” She didn’t 
dare to breath.</p><p>The blonde woman tilted her head and peered at the Martian with piqued 
interest.</p><p>“No. I’m afraid not. You must have mistaken me for someone else. But I’m 
guessing that I look like this Minako person?”</p><p><i>That’s right, she isn’t Minako. 
</i>Rei tried to grasp the situation and calm down a little. In her confusion she had made a 
silly mistake. <i>Her hair and her aura are different. </i></p><p>“If you aren’t Minako, 
then who are you?” She shot back suspiciously. Usagi was momentarily taken 
aback.</p><p>“...My name is Usagi.”</p><p>“Well then, Usagi... would you please let go of my 
hair?”</p><p>“Oh? Oh! I-I’m so sorry! I- I umm…” Usagi let go of the strands, thoroughly 
embarrassed. Her face turned beat red. She couldn’t quite believe that she had been scolded 
by another person who ‘looked’ her age and wasn’t family.</p><p>“Anyway, what happened after 
I passed out? Where are Hotaru and Setsuna?”</p><p>“I-I... well... that is...” <i>Ahhh...why 
am I stuttering?</i> “Hotaru is resting, and I don’t know where Setsuna is.”</p><p>“She’s... 
resting.” Rei arched an eyebrow. “So what are you saying? Did she receive her heart crystal 
back or something? The last thing I remember, the two of you were fighting. And the 
ruins...!” She gasped. “I need to talk to Setsuna!” She suddenly declared.</p><p>“Wait! You 
can’t!”</p><p>“Get--out of my 
way!”</p><p><i><b>Clatter-!</b></i></p><p>“Eeek!!!”</p><p><i><b>Ping!<br>Creeeeeeeak.</b></i></p><p>Without 
warning, the door opened to reveal a pair of troubled blue eyes staring back.</p><p>Minako 
stood in the doorway with her face flush and her mouth slightly agape at what she saw. She 
had no idea that Rei was such a player in her absence. The way her raven-haired friend was 
pressed up tightly against another woman on the floor was… no, wait. No, the coldness that 
was beginning to make her see red was definitely NOT from amusement. Behind her, Hotaru 
stepped forward and saw the scene with an ‘oh my’ face.</p><p>Rei had hit her head fairly 
hard, so she was a little slow on the uptake. But Usagi noticed Minako right 
away.</p><p><i>That girl…looks like me. </i>Usagi realized. “Is that Minako?” She 
questioned.</p><p>“Minako?!” Rei instinctively scrambled to get back on her feet, resulting 
in some near trips before she finally found her balance. She nearly ran into Minako in her 
hurry. “Umm...H-Hey. I didn’t expect to see you so soon.” She tried to greet with a straight 
face.</p><p>“You look like you were doing well.” Minako replied coolly.</p><p>“Huh? What do 
you mean by ‘doing well’? If you haven’t noticed, Minako, I’m covered with cuts and bru—wait 
a minute! Where did they go…? Well, I was anyway!”</p><p>“Uh huh, sure.” The Venusian 
ignored the comment and turned her back to the bewildered Martian, waving her hand 
nonchalantly. “Well, it looks like I was worried for nothing.”</p><p><i>Wait, she was 
worried about me?</i></p><p>“Umm...where are you going? You’re just going to 
leave?”</p><p>“Well, I only came up here because Setsuna asked me to bring you all down for 
our meeting,” Minako lied. “She said she had something to tell us. So? Are you coming or 
not?”</p><p>“We shouldn’t keep Setsuna waiting…” Hotaru muttered in 
agreement.</p><p>“Hotaru?” Rei was apprehensive at first, but the dark-haired heir past her 
to help her sister back up.</p><p>“Rei, can you walk on your own?”</p><p>Rei felt Minako’s 
piercing gaze on her back, and her face blushed at the humiliating implication.</p><p>“O-Of 
course I can!”</p><p>“Then... shall we go?”</p><p>Hotaru and Usagi walked out into the 
corridor together, leaving Minako and Rei trailing in an awkward silence behind 
them.</p><p>The walk was like torture for the Martian. <i>Umm... </i>Rei persisted on trying 
to establish eye contact most of the way, but her blonde companion was refusing to meet her 
gaze. It was down-right obvious that there was something on the Venusian’s mind; Minako’s 
brow was furrowed in concentration and she only stared straight ahead at their two 
guides.</p><p>As much as Rei would have loved to interrupt the daydreamer and ask her 
bluntly what her problem was, her instincts warned her that the situation that earned her 
Minako’s the ice queen demeanour could become considerably worse.</p><p><i>Somehow... I get 
the feeling that she’s mad at me. I don’t get it. What did I do? </i>Rei 
wondered.</p><p>(<u>Audience Chamber)</u></p><p>The twins led the other two back to a set of 
large, double doors.</p><p>“They should be in here.” Usagi informed them.</p><p>Hotaru 
lifted a shaky hand up and pressed against the doors. They both opened easily, revealing the 
rest of the group expectantly waiting inside. Everyone turned to look as the four women 
joined them at the center of the floor.</p><p><i>The atmosphere... it’s so tense. </i>Rei 
thought. Her dark eyes noted the two other strangers standing beside Setsuna, but said 
nothing of it. There was also a brief exchange of glances between Setsuna and 
Hotaru.</p><p><i>Hotaru...</i> No one could quite believe that the girl was a young woman 
now. She was the spitting image of the spirit on Saturn but in the flesh.</p><p>“So, are we 
all here now?” Setsuna asked.</p><p>Haruka whipped her head back towards at the woman. “It’s 
obvious that we’re all here, so quit stalling. Now... are you going to talk, or are you 
going to keep wasting our time?”</p><p>“Impatient as ever I see.”</p><p>“Well maybe you’re 
just too patient,” She countered.</p><p>“Would you be quiet already?!” Luna snapped at 
Uranus, who was completely taken aback by this. “Try to show some respect. You have done 
nothing but argue endlessly with Setsuna even though she has already clearly indicated that 
we would not answer your questions until all of us were present. Or, perhaps, are you 
implying that you think you’re more important than the rest of us?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Then 
I would suggest ceasing this child-like behaviour <i>Sir</i> Uranus.”</p><p>Haruka’s green 
eyes darkened in anger. <i>Who does she think she is?! If anyone here has an over-inflated 
ego, it’d be her!</i></p><p>“Luna, Uranus, please, that is enough,” Setsuna stepped in to 
quell the tension between her comrades. “I understand that you are all tired from your 
journey, but now is not the time to be quarrelling with one 
another.”</p><p>“But--”</p><p>“Now that we are all here, we will begin the meeting.” The 
room quieted down and all attention was now intently fixed upon the tall, green-haired 
woman. “First off, I believe that introductions are in order. As all of you have already 
seen, we have a few new faces in our group. The woman to my right is Luna. She was the Moon 
Kingdom’s scheduling coordinator and was the vice advisor to her former Majesty, Lady 
Serenity. The man to my left is Artemis. He was the highest authority in the Kingdom when it 
came to combat expertise.”</p><p>Both Artemis and Luna made small gestures of respect as 
they were addressed. Of course, some members of the group were not as 
impressed.</p><p>“Also, you may have noticed that two others have also recently joined your 
group. One of whom you’ve already met, is Lady Hotaru,” The Goddesses all nodded in unison. 
“Then... may I formally introduce you to Lady Usagi, the twin sister of Lady 
Hotaru.”</p><p><i>Usagi.</i></p><p><i>So that’s who she is. </i></p><p>Both Rei and Minako 
mentally noted of the blonde-haired stranger that they had recently met.</p><p>“They are 
both the rightful heirs to the Moon Kingdom’s throne.” Setsuna finished.</p><p>Michiru 
narrowed her eyes thoughtfully at the statement, but she didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Is it a 
pleasure to make all of your acquaintances,” Usagi smiled and curtsied.</p><p>Rei nearly 
face-palmed at the expressions Usagi was receiving.</p><p><i>Just look at them all. They 
have no clue how powerful she is. </i>Rei sighed. <i>But, that battle...When the two of them 
fought, that was some serious power they were using. Could they...possibly become even 
stronger than that? </i></p><p>“As you all already know who I am, I will not ‘waste’ your 
time any longer. Thus this brings us to the true objective of our discussion now.”</p><p>She 
paused. The others were left unaware of her need for a brief rest.</p><p><i>Just a little 
longer… </i>Setsuna assured herself. She was starting to feel dizzy.</p><p>“Many of you, if 
not all, have witnessed the destruction of our Kingdom. Even fewer have recently seen its 
rebirth. However… none of you have witnessed <i>The Battle Against the Sun</i>, the war in 
which Apollo’s Court, his once most trusted, loyal subjects, rebelled against him and 
overthrew him. These people... were your predecessors.”</p><p>‘<i>The Battle Against the 
Sun?’ </i>The mention had stirred something within Haruka’s memory. <i>Oh, </i><i>that’s 
right! The old man mentioned something about this before…</i></p><p>“If you still intend to 
defy him as they did many centuries ago, then it is imperative that you understand what you 
are going up against. For this time, your battle will be far more difficult than theirs 
was.”</p><p>The green-haired woman raised her garnet staff into the air. Both Luna and 
Artemis watched on in apprehension at what they were about to see. Hotaru turned her face 
away.</p><p>“It started shortly after the fall of the Moon Kingdom…”</p><p>The staff fell 
and its tip touched the floor, unleashing the familiar crimson 
light.</p><p><b>FLAAAAAAAASH!</b></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p><i>The Sun King’s throne room 
appeared before their eyes to reveal an image of Apollo sitting upon his throne with an 
amused smile. Before the God was a young, palace servant. He was down on his knees with his 
head pressed against the floor as he trembled in sheer terror. The subject had been summoned 
to report to His Majesty with news of the Moon Kingdom, the worst task that a subject of his 
rank could be given. He knew that he was disposable to His Highness. He could very well be 
killed without a second thought, especially of late, given the God’s progressive cruelty 
towards his subjects; even the noble Lords and Ladies of his court were not spared of his 
tyranny. Thus, where did that leave him?</i></p><p>“<i>So... you say that the Moon Kingdom 
has fallen?” Apollo questioned again.</i></p><p><i>The servant gulped and stuttered, “Y-Yes 
Your Highness. It also appeared that Her… Her Majesty... Lady Artemis has also 
p-perished.”</i></p><p>‘<i>Now he’s going to kill me, he’s going to kill me!’ The servant 
fearfully fretted. Please make it fast!</i></p><p>“<i>So my sister is dead...?” Apollo 
leaned over his seat and interlocked his hands in a thoughtful 
pose.</i></p><p>“<i>Y-Yes…”</i></p><p>“<i>I see. And what of my ‘beloved 
nieces’?”</i></p><p>“<i>Dead! They’re all dead!” He wailed in despair. “I’m so sorry Your 
Highness! Please forgive me for delivering such terrible news! None of us thought a tragedy 
like this would ever happen! I’m sorry! I’m so sorry!”</i></p><p><i>Apollo inwardly 
chuckled.</i></p><p>‘<i>Terrible news...?’ He thought to himself. ‘On the contrary—this is 
perfect! They’re all dead at last! It looks like my niece, Hotaru, did a good job. But to 
think that she also perished…Hmph. I expected as much.’</i></p><p><i>The God hid his twisted 
smile behind the back of one hand, and with the other he dismissed the apologetic servant. 
He was in a good mood, so he’d let the boy live.</i></p><p>“<i>You are 
dismissed.”</i></p><p>“<i>I-I am?!” The youth’s head shot up in 
disbelief.</i></p><p>“<i>Yes, you may go.”</i></p><p>“<i>T-Thank you Your Highness! Thank 
you!”</i></p><p><i>As the servant rushed out of the Audience Chamber, another figure 
entered. A black haired man with dark eyes strode up to where the Sun God sat, stopping 
short only to bend himself to one knee. His red armor gleamed in the light with Mars’s 
insignia on the shoulder guards.</i></p><p>“<i>Ares! How good of you to come.” Apollo 
greeted the God. In the past Apollo would have done away with this formal display of respect 
and insisted that the man would stand with him-- the two would have shook hands-- however, 
this time the Sun King made no inclination.</i></p><p><i>Ares remained kneeled as he 
addressed his Lord.</i></p><p>“<i>My Lord, I presume that you have heard the 
news?”</i></p><p>“<i>If you are referring to Moon Kingdom, then yes, I 
have.”</i></p><p>“<i>What shall we do about it?”</i></p><p>“<i>What do you 
mean?”</i></p><p>“… <i>I have spoken to Uranus of late. He believes that we should attempt 
to find the perpetrator of this heinous deed and bring them to 
justice.”</i></p><p><i>Apollo’s blood ran cold and his dim, gray eyes coolly stared down at 
his subject. Ares noticed the shift in the King’s aura, but said nothing of 
it.</i></p><p>“<i>Nothing needs to be done. Nothing can be done!” Apollo stated clearly and 
slowly as if the other man were dumb. “They are all dead. Why should we be wasting our 
resources trying to find this ‘perpetrator’? Or are you implying that there exists someone 
with the power to destroy an entire civilization in one night? A Lord or Lady of my court 
perhaps...? Are you saying… that there is a traitor amongst 
us?”</i></p><p>“<i>...”</i></p><p>“<i>What is the problem now?” He 
snapped.</i></p><p><i>Ares was largely unaffected by the hate in his voice, and continued to 
peer around the room as if he were looking for something.</i></p><p>“<i>I have not seen Lady 
Hotaru for some time now my Lord.”</i></p><p>“<i>Are you worried about the girl? How very 
unlike you, Ares-- to be worrying about another! Sometimes it is hard to imagine that you 
are the most ruthless of my court.”</i></p><p>“<i>The child usually sits next to you, Your 
Highness.” The War God merely stated. For a moment, Apollo thought he saw something else in 
those usually emotionless eyes.</i></p><p>“<i>Are you... hiding something from 
me?”</i></p><p><i>They both steadily met the other’s gaze, none of them breaking contact. 
But to Apollo’s frustration, he could find nothing in the blank gaze.</i></p><p>“<i>No, my 
Lord.” Ares finally replied.</i></p><p><i>The Sun King fell back into his seat, not quite 
satisfied. He was sure that he had felt another presence… but then again, perhaps it was his 
imagination playing tricks on him?</i></p><p>‘<i>No matter… If need be, I will do away with 
him.’ Apollo assured himself.</i></p><p>“<i>Then you are dismissed.”</i></p><p>“<i>Yes, Your 
Majesty.”</i></p><p><i>Ares rose to his feet and left the room. As soon as the man was out 
of the palace and beyond the range of detection, he suppressed his aura and quietly 
thought,</i></p><p>“<i>Did you hear that Neptune?”</i></p><p>“Unknown to Apollo, I had 
already met with the Lords and Ladies of his court prior to Sir Ares’s visit.” Setsuna’s 
voice rang out. “As it turned out, I was not the only one who shared the same suspicion 
regarding the incident. However, it would be irresponsible to declare war over speculations. 
Thus, we developed a plan to gather information. It was decided that Ares would infiltrate 
the palace under the pretence of a visit. Lady Neptune, due to her highly developed sixth 
sense, would connect through the War God once he was within the throne room. After reading 
Apollo’s aura, and hearing his lack of explanation for Lady Hotaru’s abrupt disappearance, 
we made our decision.”</p><p><i>The scene warped, flashing to the dark depths of space. 
There was a fleet of ships hovering just beyond the Sun’s gravitational pull. It could be 
seen that each planetary ruler was within his or her own silent thoughts, or consorting with 
their tacticians. Setsuna, in particular, had accompanied Lady Neptune and was keeping busy 
by confirming the last of their battle plans with the other tacticians.</i></p><p><i>The 
surroundings shifted once more to show Helios, the capital city of the Sun, as the main 
battlefield.</i></p><p><i>Two particular individuals within the City Square were zoomed in 
upon. Both Ares and Uranus stood back to back, each of them with their swords raised. 
Surrounding them was a crowd of children. Each child was armed with a small dagger and 
possessed red, glowing eyes. Neither party gave a second thought to the corpses of defeated 
soldiers that littered the ground around them.</i></p><p><i>The War God gave a disdainful 
shake of his head towards their new opponents.</i></p><p>“<i>So, is that all Apollo’s got?” 
The crimson aura around Ares flared up dangerously.</i></p><p>“<i>Ares, don’t do it! They’re 
only children!” Uranus protested.</i></p><p>“<i>Just children?! They aren’t children anymore 
Uranus! You can see that just as plainly as I can.”</i></p><p><i>Uranus averted his gaze. 
</i></p><p>“<i>You know, I never would’ve given Apollo this much credit. How long do you 
think has this been going on? When did he come up with this ingenious plan to train children 
to become soldiers? They’re practically perfect. I almost didn’t sense them!”</i></p><p>“… 
<i>Most likely, they were orphans.” The wind ruler quietly replied.</i></p><p>“<i>...Yeah.” 
Mars paused. He watched as the enemy slowly closed in on them from all sides. “Yeah, you’re 
probably right. They probably have no one to care for them. No family, and in this state, no 
friends either. Poor little bastards.”</i></p><p>“<i>...”</i></p><p>“<i>Uranus... I know how 
you feel, but it’s impossible to take them down gently. Apollo must have planned for this to 
happen even before he found out that we’ve betrayed him. They are his tools now, his pawns. 
They won’t stop fighting until they take their last breath. You can see it in their 
eyes.”</i></p><p>“<i>I know. You don’t have to say it.” The blonde man had known the rules 
of War for a long time now. He knew the risks that were involved. “It’s best to just put 
them out of their misery.”</i></p><p><i>Both men raised their swords and bolstered their 
powers.</i></p><p><i><b>SssssssssssSSSSSSSH--</b></i></p><p><i>In the decisive moment that 
their enemy attacked, the swords fell and two massive energies of gold and crimson were 
unleashed.</i></p><p>“<i>Rest in 
peace.”</i></p><p><i><b>KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</b></i></p><p><i>Even as the light faded, the 
two Gods were already walking away from the area; neither was eager to stay and admire the 
results of their work. It was also at that moment when Uranus and Ares heard Neptune’s voice 
call out to them.</i></p><p>“<i>Hurry to the palace! We have located Apollo’s 
whereabouts!”</i></p><p><i>Both Gods exchanged knowing glances. Their plan must have worked; 
their decoy had allowed the others to infiltrate inside the stronghold.</i></p><p>“By this 
time, Apollo had attempted to seal himself off within a secret, underground chamber below 
the palace. With his forces becoming effectively depleted, he came to realize that he was 
cornered…”</p><p><i>The images blurred, and came back into focus within a dark and dank 
chamber. On the center of the marble platform there was an intricate, golden pattern that 
spun outwards within the outer marked circle. The outer perimeters of the chamber were 
rounded as well and were supported by a ring of evenly spaced-out columns. The spaces 
between the pillars were like pockets of darkness in the already abysmally dim room. 
</i></p><p><i>A loud sound resounded throughout the chamber when Apollo punched the marble 
ground and dented it.</i></p><p>“<i>Blast it! When did they become so strong?!” The God 
panted for breath. “But… huff, huff… they’ll never find me here. I’m the only one left who 
knows that this place exists.”</i></p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Who’s there?!” He 
demanded. When a slim figure in the shadows stepped forward, the Sun God’s gray eyes grew 
feverish.</i></p><p>“<i>N-No... it… it can’t be! You’re supposed to be 
dead!”</i></p><p><i>Setsuna regarded her former Lord with a calm stare, but underneath it 
she was barely restraining her impulses to lash out. As she took another step forward, the 
man took another back. He was too shocked to do anything.</i></p><p>“<i>Perhaps you would 
have been the only one to know of this place… IF I had died,” She corrected 
him.</i></p><p><i>Apollo felt his throat constrict and his mouth go dry. Once glance at 
those crimson eyes told the man everything he needed to know and more. Stunned, he watched 
his former advisor lifted her garnet staff into the air.</i></p><p>“<i>W-Wait a minute 
Setsuna! Can’t we talk this out? It was all a simple mistake!”</i></p><p>“<i>...You’re 
right. It was a mistake, but on your part.” </i></p><p><i>As if on cue, all of Apollo’s 
former court emerged from the shadows. Each God and Goddess took their respective places in 
the spaces between the pillars, completely surrounding their corrupted Lord who stood at the 
center of their formed circle.</i></p><p>“<i>W-What?!” The Sun God whipped his head around, 
fearfully. His eyes came to stop on Setsuna as the red jewel of her staff began to glow. It 
suddenly dawned on him of who the mastermind of this trap was.</i></p><p>“<i>You’re the one! 
You organized this! It’s was all you, wasn’t it?! Ares!” He turned towards the War God. “Are 
you really going to betray me? You’ve always been my most loyal subject!”</i></p><p><i>Cold, 
dark eyes stared back at the grovelling man. The images of the possessed children were still 
very vivid in his mind.</i></p><p>“<i>That is enough Apollo.” He 
growled.</i></p><p><i>Apollo’s eyes widened as the rest of his ‘loyal’ subjects 
agreed.</i></p><p>“<i>Though you may not realize it, you have already fallen…”</i></p><p>“… 
<i>You are no longer the ruler you once were, but rather, a shadow of your former 
self.”</i></p><p>“<i>Once we all were proud to serve under you as our Lord…”</i></p><p>“… 
<i>But no longer.”</i></p><p>“<i>In light of your cruelty and crimes, we of your former 
court will pass judgement.”</i></p><p>“<i>No!” Apollo cried out. Now entirely cornered, the 
man’s survival instincts kicked in; his powers surged up and radiated throughout the room. 
“I will not... be defeated by the likes of you! Who do you think you are to pass judgement 
on ME?!”</i></p><p><i>In stride, the Gods and Goddesses also called upon their powers. The 
ground began to quake…</i></p><p><i><b>RMM! RMM! RMM!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Mercury Planet 
Power!”</i></p><p><i>Mercury’s insignia lit up on the blue-haired man’s forehead, and his 
aura flared up. Just as Apollo braced himself for the inevitable attack, he quickly found 
himself both astonished and confused as the blue light flew to the jewel on Setsuna’s staff 
instead.</i></p><p>‘<i>It can’t be!’ He realized. ‘They’re using her as a 
conductor?!’</i></p><p>“<i>Jupiter Planet Power!”</i></p><p>“<i>Mars Planet 
Power!”</i></p><p>“<i>Uranus Planet Power!”</i></p><p>“<i>Neptune Planet 
Power!”</i></p><p>“<i>Venus Planet Power!”</i></p><p><i><b>Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! 
Ping!<br>Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen---</b></i></p><p>“<i>This ends now!” Setsuna cried. The 
energy gathered within her jewel exploded into a white beam of light and charged the Sun 
God.</i></p><p><i><b>FwooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOSH!!!</b></i></p><p>“<i>NOOOOOOOOOOO!! I won’t 
forget this! I won’t forgive any of yooooou! I-I- 
GAAAAH-AH!”</i></p><p><b>FLAAAAAAAASH!</b></p><p><i><b>. . .</b></i></p><p>The crimson light 
receded, leaving the young group of women strangely silent. All that could be heard was the 
soft panting for breaths; the vision’s intensity had been far greater than the destruction 
of the Moon Kingdom. Each and every individual felt as though they had been actually 
witnessing the event personally through the ghosts of their mentors. Every uncertainty, 
every sense of regret, of relief, had been engrained into their souls.</p><p>Both Luna and 
Artemis had been equally affected as well. None of them knew of what to expect when Setsuna 
had informed them of the aftermath of the war. None of them knew of the crucial role their 
comrade had played either-- especially Haruka, who was now starting to see quiet woman in a 
different light.</p><p><i>I guess... she’s got some guts after all. I almost feel bad for 
yelling at her earlier. </i></p><p>Setsuna was the first to break the silence.</p><p>“That 
is how the war ended...” She spoke softly at first. “However, as I’ve said before, if you 
choose to follow the same path as they did, then it will not be as simple for you. Apollo is 
no longer trapped within a physical body. And although he is far too weak at this time to 
extend his influence to us directly, he has amassed his old allies to do his 
bidding.”</p><p>“The shadow creatures,” Makoto muttered. “So, they really were those 
children that we saw…”</p><p>Both Rei and Haruka’s gazes fell to the floor.</p><p>“Yes.” 
Setsuna affirmed. “It appears that their spirits have yet to find rest.”</p><p>“Then we will 
just have to defeat Apollo, won’t we?” Another soft voice spoke out.</p><p>The former 
advisor found it greatly ironic that it was Hotaru who had made the suggestion.</p><p>“I’ve 
made my decision. Even if no one else will do it, I will fight.” The dark-haired Moon 
Princess clarified. “I’ve… I’ve caused so much trouble for all of you, but I also need to do 
this for myself. Apollo uses people, and he’ll keep doing it to get whatever he wants. I 
know what it’s like to be used... So…”</p><p>Usagi gently held Hotaru’s shoulder, smiling a 
little at her sister’s decision.</p><p>“Not alone,” Usagi promised. “I’ll be right here at 
your side. After finally finding each other, there’s no way I’m going to let you do this by 
yourself.”</p><p>“Usagi…”</p><p>“I’m in too.” Minako stepped forward. “I know this is 
probably going to be the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done in my life... but... it’s still 
my life! Apollo has taken away too many precious people from me.”</p><p><i>I can’t forgive 
him…</i></p><p>“I’m in as well.” Makoto agreed. “I just want there to be peace again. I 
don’t think it’s right that we should be forced to fight against one another.”</p><p>Ami 
peered up at her friend, pausing for a brief moment. The battle where she and Makoto were 
forced to fight was still a blur to her, but she vividly remembered almost losing the other 
woman afterwards.</p><p>“Then I volunteer as well. I may not be as useful as a fighter, but 
I can help with strategy and back-up support.”</p><p>“Ami, are you sure?” Jupiter 
asked.</p><p>“Yes.” She nodded.</p><p>“Hell! Can you guys get anymore mushy?!”Haruka shut up 
when she noticed that her outburst had earned her many stares-- it was more than she could 
hope for. “Ahem. I think I can safely say that we’ve all lost something important because of 
this Apollo bastard. And considering everything that we’ve gone through together, why would 
any of us stop now? Why does Setsuna even have to ask us? I know I’m in.”</p><p>“That’s 
right.” Michiru nodded.</p><p>Unknown to the group of friends, there was an awkward air 
between Minako and Rei as their eyes met for the briefest of moments. The Martian had 
definitely noticed the uncertainty in those blue eyes.</p><p>Before the raven-haired soldier 
knew it, the others had come to set their gazes upon her as well.</p><p>Rei knew what was on 
their minds. The majority of them, if not all, knew by now that she was merely a human with 
uncanny heightened abilities. In a battle of Gods against Gods, did she really stand a 
chance? Or would she be the first one to die on the battlefield? The possibility was never 
wasted on her.</p><p>“What?” Rei stared back indignantly. “Do you think I’m going to back 
out now?” The Martian crossed her arms and twitched. “You people are impossible! Of course 
I’m going! Gaaa-ah!”</p><p>She cried out in surprise when Haruka ambushed her from behind 
with a rough hug.</p><p>“Yes! That’s the spirit Rei! Now we’ll just have to toughen you up 
with some more training!”</p><p>“G—aah! Get off of me 
Haruka!”</p><p><i><b>Whack!</b></i></p><p>“Ow…”</p><p>“Ahem.” Setsuna gave a little cough. 
“Then I take it that you are all committing to this path?”</p><p>“Yes!” Everyone cried out 
in unison.</p><p>Setsuna had to admit she was impressed by this display. <i>So, even after 
hearing everything I had to say, they’re still going to fight? </i>Whether it was due to 
foolishness or bravery, it was unknown to the woman, but she was certain about one 
thing—their hearts were in the right place.</p><p><i>Now, the rest is up to us. </i>She 
affirmed to herself.</p><p>“Luna.” The former advisor requested.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“If you 
will?”</p><p>“… I understand.” She curtly nodded back. “If you will all please follow me, I 
will show you to your rooms. You will be allowed to rest for the remainder of today, but 
starting tomorrow we will begin your training.”</p><p>As everyone turned to follow the 
woman, Rei hung back for a moment.</p><p>“Umm, Minako?”</p><p>The blue-eyed Goddess briefly 
considered stopping to talk to her friend until the image of seeing Rei in that other 
blonde’s arms came back to mind.</p><p>“...Not now Rei.” Minako sighed and then followed 
after the group, leaving the Martian the last one to follow.</p><p>As the distance between 
them increased, all she could think was,</p><p><i>What the hell?!</i></p>
