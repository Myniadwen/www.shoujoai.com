<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 36 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/etercity-ch35.html">Back to Part 35</a><pre>Jun Fudoh watched Alucard walk away, the red garbed
vampire leaving her after their completing another
assignment for their mysterious patron. &#145;This might
just be my chance,&#39; she thought, moving into a dark
alley before letting her transformation take hold of
her.

The slim, almost too light Jun bulged as muscles
swelled and grew, her body expanding as a thin layer
of fur grew over her body. AS her hair swept up into
tiny wings real ones burst from her back, the Devilman
form making her nearly a foot taller. With a sweep of
her wings she was in the air, inhuman vision tracking
her prey easily.

Alucard was a vampire, well over a thousand years old
if you believed him, and with his senses tracking him
from the ground would be impossible. From the air,
however, might give Jun a chance, especially if he was
overconfident as usual. On the breeze Jun soared as
Alucard walked the darkened streets, her eyes never
leaving him.

When Jun had been recruited by Alucard and the
mysterious Major Motoko Kusanagi she had assumed they
were privately operating, but the mission to Xena had
convinced her otherwise. It had been a full military
action, and the Major had clearly been in charge. That
meant she worked for the government...and Jun wanted
to know more.

Alucard passed by the police station then surprisingly
turned to enter the Memorial Park nearby, weaving
through the garden and many statues until he reached a
certain marker. He stood there for a few moments until
the Major appeared, accompanied by another woman...one
that Jun instantly recognized.

&#145;Sailor Venus,&#39; Jun felt a shock then a wave of black
rage, &#145;I&#39;ve been working for the damned Sailor
Senshi?!&#39;

Fighting for control Jun left not knowing what she
might do otherwise. Her transformation, the death of
her beloved were all Asuka Ran&#39;s doing, but the blonde
witch&#39;s reserarch couldn&#39;t have begun with out Sailor
Mercury&#39;s research...and the Beast Progress might have
been stopped completely if the Sailor Senshi had been
there to help.

Driven by her fury Jun reached her apartment, landing
on the balcony as rage simmered in her blood. Too
angry to revert to human the Devilman proceeded to
trash the place, claws and muscle destroying furniture
and cloth with hideous ease...

Nearly a week later Nadesico Kinimoto put down the
phone with a frown on her pretty face. She ran a hand
through her short red hair as she looked out her
office window and thought worriedly, &#145;Jun still isn&#39;t
answering.&#39;

Nadesico had wanted to invite Jun out during the fall
festival, the three nights that ended with a night of
costumed revelry, but so far she hadn&#39;t been able to
reach her. She hadn&#39;t gone to her apartment because
she knew how much Jun valued her privacy, but...

With a sigh Nadesico got up from her desk, picking up
her jacket and slugging it on over her work clothes.
She headed up the hall and knocked, &quot;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m
heading out.&quot;

Mai Tokhia looked up from her own work, the orange
haired young woman smiling slightly. &quot;No problem,&quot; she
said, &quot;we&#39;re about done for the day.&quot; She smiled as
she looked at Nadesico, &quot;So, did you ask her out for
tonight?&quot;

Nadesico blushed. &quot;No,&quot; she confessed, &quot;I can&#39;t seem
to get a hold of her.&quot;

Mai gave her a perceptive look, &quot;And you&#39;re worried
about her.&quot;

&quot;Jun has only been out of seclusion a few months now,&quot;
Nadesico fretted, &quot;I keep wondering if she&#39;ll decide
just to leave...&quot;

&quot;And you like her,&quot; Mai noted. She leaned forward,
&quot;You and I both know her background, she&#39;s grieved for
her lover Kazumi for centuries. She may not be ready
to accept your feelings.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want her to be forced to accept how I feel,&quot;
Nadesico smiled wryly, &quot;I just want to be her friend.&quot;

&quot;She may not be ready to accept that, either,&quot; Mai
smiled, remembering a certain friend of her own from
long ago. Shaking off her memories she said, &quot;We do
have that new contract for Jun to look at...&quot;

Nadesico met her boss&#39; smile, &quot;A good excuse to check
in on her.&quot; She rose then bowed slightly, &quot;Thank you,
ma&#39;am.&quot;

Mai waved her off with a laugh, &quot;Good luck!&quot;

Nadesico hurried home, first, changing from her
business wear to a casual dress and simple shoes, then
hesitated over the costumes she had purchased.
Deciding on a catgirl she crabbed the bag and Jun&#39;s
costume then headed out, noting that twilight had come
and the children and adults in costume had appeared.

The fall festival was a mix of traditions dating back
centuries, from the Day of the Dead to Octoberfest to
Halloween. For three days there was a celebration of
the change of seasons, a shift from light to dark and
finally a night of costumed craziness as we formally
said goodbye to summer and hello to fall.

Reaching the apartment Nadesico hesitated, then used
the code Jun gave her to get by security and enter.
She felt a bit guilty about not calling ahead but
squelched the feeling, hurrying upstairs to the upper
floor apartment. She knocked once, waited, then
knocked again into the almost eerie silence.

&quot;Jun? It&#39;s Nadesico,&quot; she called, feeling remarkably
foolish.

There was a moment of silence, then the door opened
slightly as Jun croaked, &quot;Go away.&quot;

Nadesico caught a glimpse of a pale face and bloodshot
eyes and felt a surge of alarm. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;
she demanded, pushing forward.

Jun staggered backward, clearly drunk, then fell on
her butt in the wreckage of her apartment. The
furniture had been turned to rags and twisted metal,
the pictures torn down and even the walls scored by
claw marks. Empty bottles littered the floor and
pieces of broken glass crunched underfoot.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jun managed to get up, &quot;you caught me at a
bad time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Nadesico moved to support the other
woman. She looked around at the destruction in awe,
&quot;What happened?&quot;

Jun sighed, feeling her system shrugging off the
effects of the booze. &quot;I got angry,&quot; she said grimly,
realizing how much of a mess she was.

&quot;If this is angry I don&#39;t want to see furious,&quot;
Nadesico quipped.

Jun looked at her in shocked surprise then began to
laugh. &quot;No you don&#39;t,&quot; Jun agreed with a chuckle,
finding the strength to stand on her own. She looked
around the wreckage, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you had to see this.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Nadesico hesitated, &quot;I tried calling
but...&quot;

Jun gestured to a pile of junk in the corner, &quot;I think
I thrashed the phone pretty early on.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Nadesico looked around the ruined suite and
knew her hope of taking Jun out tonight was wrecked.

A firework whistled then exploded outside, filling the
night with light as Jun winced. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; she
scowled.

&quot;The fall festival,&quot; Nadesico responded automatically.

Jun mentally calculated the date then sighed,
&quot;Halloween, of course.&quot;

&quot;I remember it was called that,&quot; Nadesico realized she
had dropped her costume bag and went to go pick it up.

Jun smiled slightly as she saw the pink cat ears that
were sticking out the top of the bag, &quot;Planning to go
out?&quot;

Nadesico confessed, &quot;I was planning to ask you to join
me.&quot;

Jun raised her eyebrows at Nadesico, then looked
around her suite. Now stone sober she knew she should
clean up after her fit of irritation, but the silent
appeal in Nadesico&#39;s eyes was compelling. &quot;You want to
change in the bathroom?&quot; Jun offered with a faint
smile, &quot;I&#39;ll see what I can come up with.&quot;

&quot;Uhm, I actually brought something for you, too,&quot;
Nadesico tentatively offered the bundle from her bag.

Jun held up the red devil costume with little horns.
&quot;I&#39;m not sure to laugh or be offended,&quot; she finally
admitted.

&quot;Laugh, please,&quot; Nadesico blushed.

Jun did laugh as she said, &quot;Okay, I put myself in your
hands.&quot;
