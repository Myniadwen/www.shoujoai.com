<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 6 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>With in two weeks after the first attack, Lita and Mina had moved into 
the mansion. Life was good when Terri arrived and even got better. No 
matter that a new enemy came with the young Princess. They all had 
quickly attached to her, and she to them. No one new how glad Terri 
was to be with her brother and friends. Terrestrial was a lovely 
planet, but terribly lonely when you&#146;ve been stuck there for over 
1,000 years. Not to mention how well Terri&#146;s career was doing on 
Earth. The clothes she created at UN Productions were among the best. 
If not the best. She often liked using the girls as her models and 
paid them for their work. Life was just getting better!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&#147; My Lord, you called me?&#148; Naraiah stood in front of Lord Dradian 
respectably. 

&#147; Yes, I would like to know how the battle went. Are they strong?&#148;

&#147; Yes my Lord, I believe they are. Though if we go according to plan, 
the warriors shall fall easily.&#148;

&#147; Very well, on our third attack we will put the plan into motion. 
Prepare the youma for battle. The 2nd attack will take place in just 4 
hours.&#146;

&#147; Yes my Lord.&#148; Naraiah vanished to prepare.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Another battle soon&#133;.I can sense it. I hate putting them through 
what&#146;s coming.- 

Terri was thinking this as she worked on a dress Mina was modeling. 
She snapped out of it when she heard a loud &#147; Ouch!&#148;.

&#147; Terri! You just pricked me with that stupid needle! You never do 
that. Is something wrong?&#148; Terri stood up, glad to be done with the 
hemming of the dress. She moved around the Love Goddess. 

&#147; Oh nothings wrong, but I can sense the next battle coming.&#148;

&#147; When?&#148; 

&#147; Maybe today. Possibly in just a few hours.&#148;

&#147; Shouldn&#146;t we warn the others?&#148;

&#147; Yes, you contact the inners and I&#146;ll tell the outers. Wait, Mina 
what time is it?&#148;

&#147; Ummm&#133;3:00, why?&#148; 

&#147; Just seeing if Hotaru is out of school yet. The battle will be later 
in the evening I&#146;m sure.&#148; 

&#147; OK&#148;

Mina called Serena at her Auto Repair shop, Rei at the Temple, Ami at 
the Hospital, Lita at her new Restaurant,&amp; Darien at Shields Inc. 
Terri in turn called Hotaru at the Mansion, the racetrack for Amara, 
Michelle at the Museum,&amp; Setsuna at the Police Department. Each 
leaving for the Mansion immediately. With in half n&#146; hour everyone was 
sparing and training for the upcoming battle. 

- This battle will be difficult. The more training, the better.- Mars 
moved with fierce agility as she spared with Terrestrial. Twenty 
minutes later the Senshi felt dark energy by the lake. Instantly 
teleporting for a fight.

There in front of them were the ugliest youma ever seen! At least 30 
of them drooling everywhere. In the black sky was Naraiah, smirking 
evilly.

&#147; Kill anything that attacks you. Be careful they may take forms as 
one of us, do not be tricked!&#148; Understanding their orders the Senshi 
waited for the youma to attack. It didn&#146;t take long for most of the 
youma to be slayed. Though they thought Sailor Moon was a great 
target. Mars &amp; Terrestrial went to her aid as she fought. In a matter 
of minutes the youma were dead and dissolving. Yet again the Senshi 
had received extensive damage. Venus &amp; Mercury were unconscious. Being 
held by their loves Pluto &amp; Jupiter. 

&#147; Nicely done Sailor Scouts!&#148; This came from a new voice. Everyone 
looked up to see a man floating near Naraiah. The man had short black 
hair and his silver suite rivaled with his eyes. 

&#147; Princess! How nice to see you again. You have trained them very 
well.&#148; he had a evil grin on his face, looking at them as if they were 
ants.

&#147; You dare to show your face Dradian? I&#146;d think you might wait 
awhile.&#148; There was anger &amp; hate in Terrestrials voice. Which stunned 
the others quite a bit. 

&#147; I&#146;m stunned by your hateful tone my dear Princess! A person would 
hope that tone was loving.&#148;

- That&#146;s it! I&#146;m tired, in pain, and I don&#146;t wanna listen to this jerk 
talk. Plus he&#146;s provoking my Terri! I know he hasn&#146;t said anything 
yet, but I can tell where this is leading.- Mars limped over to stand 
beside to the angry Sailor. 

&#147; Listen you fool. Leave now or later your going to need some burning 
gel!&#148; Dradian seemed to take the hint and vanished at her warning. 
They waited to make sure he was completely gone and detransformed. Rei 
promptly collapsed into Terri&#146;s soft arms. Her ankle an odd plum 
color. Terri looked at the girl in her arms.

&#147; So does this mean Jayton has competition for his position as my 
personal bodyguard?&#148; Rei smiled &#147; Possibly&#148; and fell asleep 
teleporting once again to the Mansion for recovery. </pre>
