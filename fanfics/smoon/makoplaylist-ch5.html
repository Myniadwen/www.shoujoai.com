<h1>Makoto's Playlist (part 5 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chakeroo.html">chakeroo</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makoplaylist-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><p class="p1"><i>A few days after Valentine’s day.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako was walking down with Makoto as the brunette was walking her home 
after the group study. Makoto gave Minako an almost life sized teady bear after the 
brunette arrived at the study group. The blonde was hugging the teady bear and had a hard 
time walking so Makoto asked her if she could carry the teady bear for her but the blonde 
refused. Makoto laughed. After that, they quietly walked towards Minako’s home.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">………</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Minakochan come on. Spill!!! How was the date?” asked Usagi as she took the 
Minako’s shoulders and shook her. Minako sweat dropped. She was leaning on the teady bear 
Makoto gave her earlier.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah Makochan, how did the date go?” Rei turned to Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The two turned beet red and everyone ended up teasing the two until Minako 
finally gave up.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I almost burned her apartment down after I knocked a few candles from the 
table. I tried wiping the wine out her suit.” Minako laughed she was now hugging the teady 
bear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto was blushing again. “I accidentally spilled some to my shirt.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh I thought you knocked the candles down because you were…” before Usagi 
could finish what she would say, Rei covered her mouth and said, “So what happened 
after?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Makoto sang to me as we danced. She gave me a dozen beautiful roses. It was 
an apple green colored roses! It was a great date.” Minako then looked at Makoto and then 
went to her and hugged her, “<i>Really </i>great! Best date ever!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Both of them blushed. Minako could feel Makoto’s pulse racing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhh!!!!!!” Everyone exclaimed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Usagi then took the teady bear that Makoto gave Minako and hugged it. “What’s 
the name of this teady bear?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Jupiter?” Minako answered in a laugh, she then took the teady bear, hugged 
it and sat beside Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Usagi thought that she sniffed a familiar scent as she hugged the bear 
earlier. “Did you put some of your perfume on the bear Makochan?” asked Usagi.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Eerrrm… Sort of…” Makoto answered and tried to look away from Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I like it Makochan. At least when I’m asleep I’ll know you’re there.” Minako 
whispered to Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto’s face went beet red and then everyone laughed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">……...</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While walking, they saw two girls, about their age, kiss on the street.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They both blushed. But they were surprised to what came next.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Suddenly a car stopped at the side a man came running towards the two girls. 
The man took one of the girls by her arms and shook her while he shouted, “Get away from my 
daughter you freak!” A woman also exited the car and slapped both girls.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The other girl tried to protect the daughter but she was pushed to the ground 
by the mom.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The dad was trying hard not to let go of her daughter as she was fighting to 
let go. The dad’s hand accidentally slipped and the daughter ran towards the other girl and 
kissed her. With tears running through her eyes, she said, “I am sorry my angel. I am 
really sorry. I love you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The other girl kissed her also and said, “I love you so much but I can’t see 
you get hurt by your own parents. Forget about me.” And then the other girl stood up and 
ran.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The daughter was shocked and was still looking at the girl who ran. She 
didn’t notice that another girl came out of the car and hugged her. She whispered something 
to the younger girl and looked at her sadly. The older girl then lead the younger one to 
the car. The parents were still shouting at the girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As they were walking towards the car, the older girl accidentally looked at 
Makoto. She looked shocked and then she looked like she would cry and wanted to go towards 
Makoto. The mom saw this and held her daughter’s arm and shot an angry look at Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The car passed by Makoto and Minako and the blonde saw Makoto look inside the 
car. The parents glared at the two while the daughters didn’t look. Both daughters looked 
like they were crying.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>What was that for?</i> Thought Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako looked at Makoto and saw that the brunette was gritting her teeth and 
her hands were clenched. She touched Makoto’s arm and the brunette calmed a bit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Let’s go Minachan. I’ll walk you to your house.” Makoto became serious and 
gestured without looking at her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako was worried with Makoto but she didn’t say anything. She held Makoto’s 
hand and they walked towards her house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">……..</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After that incident, Makoto gradually became distant to Minako day after day. 
Minako was really worried but she can’t get the courage to ask the brunette why.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>It’s been months now and I haven’t asked her why she became distant 
gradually. She thinks I don’t notice but I do. She says it’s because she’s busy with café 
opening but I know that is not the reason. Oh Makochan why won’t you tell me… </i>Minako 
thought while walking towards the shrine for the group study. When she got to the shrine, 
she noticed Makoto was still not there and when she looked at Rei, the miko gestured that 
Makoto wasn’t coming today.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Not again. That’s the 4<sup>th</sup> time this week. She won’t even talk 
to me on the phone for 5 minutes. I can’t be thinking about this. The final exams are 
coming up.</i> Minako distracted herself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She then she went inside the shrine and tried her best to study.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">……..</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After the exams as Minako walked home alone then she saw Michiru in a store. 
She walked up to her and said hi.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hey Minachan. Are you ok? Do you want to talk about it?” asked Michiru 
looking at the troubled girl. Minako looked like she would burst out in tears at any 
moment.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is it okay with you? I don’t want to impose or something.” Minako 
answered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, I don’t mind. Let’s go to a café to talk.” Michiru then lead the 
way.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">……...</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Makoto’s kind of ignoring me. And it’s troubling me a lot. She’s sweet and 
everything and then she gradually became distant. She even gave me a teady bear with her 
perfume on it. But now, every time I see the bear, it reminds me of her. I feel that 
something is troubling her but she won’t tell me. I miss her badly and it’s making me 
insane. It’s like I can feel her pain even when I’m not with her and it’s even worse when I 
look into her eyes. I know she’s holding back something and its making her feel pain 
everyday. I want to hug her and say everything will be ok or just do anything so that her 
pain would stop. How would I do that if she doesn’t even give me a chance to do it?” Minako 
told Michiru trying not to cry.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now now Minako. Don’t cry. Do you know why you feel this way about her? Why 
you are so concerned on what she’s feeling?” inquired Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To tell you the truth I don’t know. I felt this <i>thing</i> about her that 
I can’t fully describe since we met. I just locked it out because I didn’t want to scare 
everyone I know. Then one day, the others started teasing me and my mom was ok with the 
date with Makochan and suddenly all these feelings came out and now I’m confused!” cried 
Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Michiru smiled. “Is it the same thing that you feel about your other 
friends?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“… Not really. It’s like she’s special or something.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Have you considered the thought that maybe you’re in love with her?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In love?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako blushed and Michiru laughed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is this it? That’s what I am feeling?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Michiru nodded. Minako then hugged the Michiru after realizing 
everything.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You’re funny Minachan. You know when everybody else is in love, being Venus 
and all, but you can’t tell if you’re in love with someone. Hahaha…” Michiru laughed 
teasingly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not that I didn’t know, it’s just that I didn’t know what to call 
<i>that</i> feeling. It’s different from the feelings that I read from other people.” 
Minako said blushing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I was just joking Minachan… And now you know why Makochan was acting weird 
around you?” asked Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako thought about it for a while and her eyes became wide after realizing 
the answer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>She’s in love with me? Oh Kami! Why didn’t I notice?!? I just thought 
because I was like a special friend… Wait… That was what I thought about her! Baka baka 
baka Minako!!!</i> She thought then face palmed herself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Michiru smiled. “Go on, talk about anything about Makoto then you’ll realize 
on what’s troubling her.”<i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Minako talked about the 1<sup>st</sup> time she and Makoto met, her mom’s 
reaction when she told her that Makoto had asked her out, the best date ever, the life size 
teady bear named Jupiter and how it smelled like Makoto and then the scene that they saw a 
couple of months ago. Minako suddenly stopped after telling the story of the two girls. 
Michiru smiled as she saw Minako realize what was bothering Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>She’s afraid that my parents will hurt me and my friends will leave me? So 
she’s opting to just be a martyr and torture herself instead? But that’s ridiculous. 
</i>Minako thought annoyingly. <i>My parents and friends won’t leave me if they knew that I 
love Makoto.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">As if Michiru could read the blonde’s mind, she started saying, “You know 
Minachan, not everybody is as lucky as you. As you said, your parents seemed to approve of 
Makoto and we definitely would love to see you get together with her but most people would 
have to cut their communications with their loved ones if they found out they’re gay, some 
fathers even let their daughters be raped by another man just to prove that their daughter 
is not gay. I’m not joking about this.” Michiru told Minako as she held her hand on the 
table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It wasn’t easy for me and Haruka at first. My parents almost disowned me and 
Haruka as well. We just fought for our love and luckily they gave in with the thought of 
that. But for some reason, we had to still prove to them that the relationship is genuine 
and we always prove that no matter what.” She continued.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako listened intently at Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Maybe that’s the reason why Makoto’s holding back. She doesn’t want you to 
get alienated by your loved ones. She knows the feeling of being surrounded by a lot of 
people and she still felt alone.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako tried hard not to cry. She felt the pain of Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is big difference between friendship and true love Minachan. She loves 
all of us but friendship can’t fully fill the void that’s meant for a lover. She feels that 
pain everyday and yet she endures it for you. Do you get what I mean?” asked Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But you’re all okay about it right? So why is she still holding back?” 
Minako was now sobbing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Because she doesn’t know that your parents are alright about this and she’s 
afraid she might lose all you. For her, it’s better to see you end up with someone else 
than not seeing you at all. Friendship or none at all and she chose friendship. She may 
have had an experience about this in the past that’s why she’s not risking anything now. 
You should at least talk to your parents about this to confirm that they’re alright if you 
pursue a relationship with Makoto then tell her yourself that it will be alright.” Advised 
Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Michiru then hands over a tissue to Minako to wipe her tears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You want us to help you to talk to Makoto?” Asked Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako nodded.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">…….</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hey Makochan! Wait up!” Rei shouted as the miko tried to catch up with the 
brunette.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto looked back and said, “Oh hi Rei. What you’ve been up to?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I should ask you that question.” Rei responded while panting as she got to 
where Makoto was.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why?” Makoto was confused.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t see us anymore and we know that you’re trying to shut everyone out 
Makoto. What’s wrong with you? You think we don’t notice that? We are being affected on 
what you’re doing with Minachan. Why are you doing this?” Answered Rei. The miko was 
getting angry with Makoto and it showed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you still have school tomorrow?” asked the brunette without looking at 
Rei.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Huh? None. Why?” asked the confused miko.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Just come with me.” Then Makoto walked away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After a few rides and a couple of hours passed, Makoto and Rei was walking in 
a park. There were a lot of benches but Makoto seemed to search for a particular one.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This is it!” exclaimed Makoto and sat down. She gestured to the miko to sit 
down with her. Rei looked at the brunette and sat down.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What’s so special about this bench anyway?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This is where my parents met.” Makoto smiled as she told Rei.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei was surprised. Makoto didn’t tell much about her parents to them, let 
alone her past.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My parents used to take me here when I was little and told me about their 
story. My dad was sitting at this very bench when my mom walked by. Ever since she saw her, 
he waited everyday just to get a glimpse of her and finally after a few weeks, he had the 
courage to introduce himself and the rest was history.” Makoto then took a small box out of 
her pocket and opened it. There was a ring inside. Rei looked at the ring then to Makoto. 
She knew that it is better to just let the brunette talk.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“When I was young, I went to a school here and because I grew up faster than 
the other kids, I had to wear the boys’ uniform. I got teased about it but I didn’t care 
because my mom said it fit me right and she would always smile at me every morning and my 
dad pats me at the head.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“One day, a girl, a year older than me, was being bullied by some boys and I 
helped her. We became friends after that and I kind of joined their group of friends. After 
that and we were all happy and I thought I found friends that I could trust. I didn’t know 
at that time that I was kind of having this puppy love situation with the girl I 
rescued.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“One afternoon, after the classes were over, I waited for her at the gates of 
the school. Our other friends went ahead to do some shopping but she didn’t want to go so I 
walked her home and she suddenly kissed me in front of their house. I didn’t notice that 
her mom was looking at us through their window. Our relationship kind of grew from there, 
we would hold hands, kiss and hug one another. Our friends were sort of okay with it. They 
only talked to me when I’m with her and our relationship became gossip at the school. Then 
day came when her parents just took her away without notice. She just didn’t come to class 
anymore and because of the gossip, my friends left me. I was alienated by everyone and that 
was the start that I got into fights almost every day.” Makoto was now looking at the sky 
as she narrated her story.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My parents knew about the relationship and what had happened but they didn’t 
talk to me until they saw come home looking sad and black and blue all over. My parents 
brought me here and talked to me. I will never forget what my dad said to me that day. He 
said that I shouldn’t mind what when other feel tell what and what not to feel. And 
everything will be alright and I shouldn’t be ashamed of what I am and who I love because 
love is love. It doesn’t know gender, race or anything. It only knows love.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“After the talk, my mom gave me this ring. It was her engagement ring. She 
didn’t know why she wanted to give it to me that early but she said when I meet that 
special girl, I should give that ring to her. A week after that, their plane crashed.” 
Makoto was now looking down and tries to hide the tears that were coming out of her 
eyes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I got so traumatized about everything after that. I blamed myself with 
everything that had happened. I had no support system of whatsoever that is why I got into 
many fights and transferred from different schools. I reasoned to myself that I’d start all 
over again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then there were you guys and Minachan. I thought maybe I should hide the 
feelings that I felt for Minachan because I thought that history might repeat itself if I 
told her I love her.” Makoto looked at the ring and was now visibly crying. “I just didn’t 
want to lose you guys. I don’t want to be alone again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Makochan… we would never leave you.” was the only thing that Rei could say 
after that. She hugged the brunette and rocked her to make her calm down.</p>
