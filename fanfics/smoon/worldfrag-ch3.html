<h1>World in Fragments (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/worldfrag-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>She didn&#146;t know how long she stood in the small shop at the end of the 
world. Staring at small packages. People were passing by. They all 
were in a hurry. None of them looked at the young woman standing in 
front of a white shelf looking down at several white packages. Her 
dark green eyes looked tired and her face was very pale. She wore a 
thick, black jacket but her body still trembled as if she was really 
cold.

I am crazy.

Haruka shook slightly her head. After her training at the race track 
she sat down in her silver Ferrari and drove over two hours like hell 
to get into a village at the other side of the big island. To make 
really sure that there was no one who would recognize her. Who knew 
her.

What if I am right?

Her hands shook as she reached for one package and looked closer at 
the cover. She saw a laughing woman and wondered if any women who used 
it would be so happy like this one.

No, I am certainly wrong. But instincts never betrayed me...

Haruka looked after the price and raised surprised one eyebrow. It was 
very expensive. Too expensive for the sense it had been made once.

Well, if you&#146;re desperate enough you&#146;d spend every yen you have just 
to be sure.

She sighed deeply, searched shortly for her cheque card and walked 
over to the counter to pay it. The old man behind it looked up at her 
and frowned. He knew that a lot of women came in his shop to buy it 
but it was seldom that a man bought it. A man with such a concerned 
look in his dark green eyes. He told him the amount and the young man 
paid.

&#147;Wish you luck. You and your girlfriend.&#148; Said the old man and smiled 
an understanding, pity smile Haruka hated. It was the same smile she 
got when she had to tell strangers that she was indeed a woman. That 
she was indeed Michiru&#146;s girlfriend. That she was indeed Hotaru&#146;s 
&gt;papa&lt;.

She grabbed the package and put it deep into the pockets of her 
jacket. Then she climbed into the silver Ferrari, speeded up and flew 
over the small street not caring about red lights or rights of way. 
Some horns honked but she didn&#146;t hear them.

Her race down the highway towards Tokyo looked like a flight.

***

&#147;Ten&ocirc;-san? Are you ready? The manager wants to talk to you and the 
mechanic wants to tell you something about your car.&#148;

Haruka took a deep breathe.

&#147;Hai. I am coming. Just two more minutes.&#148; She shouted back and heard 
how the steps went away.

My goddess...

The young car racer raised her head and looked out of the tiny window 
to see the snow flakes falling down. They looked so light, so 
weightless. But at the same time so full of energy. So full of life...

Haruka sat on the toilette of the race track. She had locked herself. 

For over half an hour now. Of course some one mentioned it. They all 
did sooner or later when the wildest and best car racer they ever had 
in their team, simply disappeared. The training wasn&#146;t over now but 
the senshi of the wind was sure that she wouldn&#146;t take part in it any 
longer for today. Last weekend she won the Grand Prix of Japan and now 
they practised for the World&#146;s Championship. But Haruka wasn&#146;t in the 
mood today to sit down behind a steering wheel and to feel the horses 
under the red bonnet.

It can&#146;t be!

She swallowed hard and slowly she lowered her head from the snow 
outside. Only one week until Christmas and for the first time of her 
life the young car racer was scared of the festival of love. Afraid of 
being alone. Total alone. Forever...

It can&#146;t be!

For another ten minutes she stared back at the red sign in her hands.

It was obviously and she knew if she would repeat it the red sign 
would appear again.

It won&#146;t change.

Haruka swallowed hard and came back to her feet. She put the white 
thing back into her jacket and slowly left the toilette.

It can&#146;t be, but it is true!

***

&quot;The Christmas tree should stay in that corner.&quot; Sceptically Minako 
observed the large living-room and walked around with a big ruler. 
Everything should be perfect. Of course it should be.

&quot;I am so exited what Mamo-chan will give me and what he will think of 
my gift.&quot; Usagi sat on the white couch and looked dreamy into the 
chimney. A nice, light fire burned in it and with some candles 
lightened it made a comforting atmosphere. Like real Christmas. Still 
they had to wait for almost another week but they were all crazy about 
it now. Usagi&#39;s parents invited some of their friends and Rei&#39;s temple 
was closed during the Christmas time, because her grandfather wanted 
to tidy it up. At least one time at the year, he told his 
granddaughter and all the senshi looked with big, pleading eyes at 
Haruka and Michiru.

&quot;What is it this time? A handmade scarf no one can look at it because 
all assume it to be a pullover without any holes for the head or the 
arms?&quot; asked Rei and soon they both got into a nice argument. Ami 
didn&#39;t listen to them. She had put her thick book away and looked in 
the chimney, too. She loved Christmas. Especially since she could 
celebrate it with her friends. Of course her mother had to work that 
special evening but the senshi of the water knew that she wouldn&#39;t be 
lonely that night. Never again.

The senshi of the wind entered their house and shook the snow out of 
her jacket while she changed her shoes. She ran a icy hand through her 
slightly wet hairs and put down some bag on the kitchen&#39;s table. She 
could hear how Rei and Usagi argued and a thin smile appeared on her 
pale face.

&quot;More gifts?&quot; asked Makoto who observed the kitchen and made notes on 
a sheet what else she had to buy. Or at least Michiru had to buy for 
her. Because the inner senshi were still at school and so the outer 
senshi decided to invite them in this Christmas.

&quot;Hai.&quot; Haruka oppressed a yawn. She looked really tired. &quot;Your 
trainer&#39;s too hard with you. Did you train up to now?&quot; Makoto opened a 
cooking book and studied the table of contents.

&quot;Next year&#39;s the World Championship and he wants me to win it.&quot;

&quot;As always.&quot; Giggled the senshi of thunder and looked curiously at the 
bags.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare to risk a look, Mako. Otherwise I&#39;ll have to punish 
you in the name of Uranus.&quot; Laughed Haruka and went over to the great 
cook. &quot;And, what are we supposed to eat in about a week?&quot;

&quot;That shall be a surprise.&quot; Answered Makoto with a smile and yawned, 
too. Christmas time was a hard time.

Especially when she had to bake so many cakes, ginger breads and Santa 
Clauses.

&quot;Ohhh....&quot; Haruka seemed to be disappointed. The smaller senshi 
giggled, then concentrated on the receipt again.

&quot;It&#39;s already seven, isn&#39;t it? Damned!&quot; cursed Michiru as she ran 
through the living-room. Shortly she embraced her lover and gave her a 
quick kiss on the still cold lips. The senshi of the wide ocean wear 
her violin case in her hands and she almost strangled herself with the 
long scarf she war wearing. Then they heard the horn outside.

&quot;Hell, they&#39;ll be angry with me when I am too late.&quot; Said Michiru but 
kissed her Ruka again. They didn&#39;t see the whole day and this time was 
simply busy. Christmas time. A lot of tests, a lot of concerts. This 
was the best time to get money from rich people. For poor children. 
And some of the concerts were tradition. She couldn&#39;t simply cancel 
them all, only the ones that weren&#39;t so important. She knew she needed 
more time with her Haruka and she swore to herself that she would take 
it after Christmas.

&quot;Gomen, I don&#39;t have the time. They wanted to fetch me up ten minutes 
ago and...&quot; Michiru kissed her Haruka again and Makoto couldn&#39;t 
oppress a giggle. &quot;And I simply forgot time. I wanted to practice that 
complicate part again and...&quot;

&quot;I have to talk to you.&quot; Whispered Haruka and Makoto frowned as she 
suddenly heard sadness in that always joking, always teasing, always 
laughing voice.

Michiru hesitated and stared into dark green eyes. Then they heard the 
horn again. Honking impatiently. Some of her fellow musicians sat in 
the car and they all knew how angry the conductor could react if they 
were late.

Especially before Christmas.

&quot;Can we talk about it later?&quot; asked Michiru and hated herself for 
those words. But she couldn&#39;t simply cancel the whole thing. The 
beneficial concert she would give at Christmas Day and at Sylvester 
were too important for the foundation.

&gt;But if you can help only one of those children to become healthy and 
strong again, it&#39;s worth it.&lt; she heard the soft voice in her head 
while she headed towards the door and knew that she did the right 
thing.

&quot;Sure...&quot; answered Haruka and felt how her throat tightened. Then the 
senshi of the wide ocean was gone and she felt suddenly very alone.

I wanted to tell you. Right now. When I didn&#39;t have the time to think 
about it. To understand it. 

Haruka ignored Makoto&#39;s asking looks and went over to the living-room. 
She saw how Rei haunted Usagi, Minako observed the wall with stars 
sparkling in her eyes and Ami looking dreamy into the steady flames. 
Mamoru and Setsuna were still at university and at work. They would 
join them later.

&quot;And then the big bear said to the little dragon: Hey, bear, don&#39;t you 
know it&#39;s cold out there?&quot; Haruka turned her heard as she heard the 
high voice and another one laughing happily. Chibiusa said on a big 
blanket in front of the couch. She hold two toys in her hands and 
played for Hotaru. The small girl clapped exited in her hands and her 
dark eyes sparkled. A lucky smile laid on her now redden face and her 
hands tried to touch the animals moved by the future Princess of 
Crystal Tokyo.

I love you so much.

Haruka took a deep breathe but couldn&#39;t enter the living-room. She 
simply stood their, leaned her right arm against the door frame. Her 
Michiru was gone to have another test that would last very long. Maybe 
up to midnight. Maybe up to dawn. Suddenly Haruka felt like a stranger 
in her own house. So absent under all those happy laughing girls. So 
wrong because she couldn&#39;t feel any joy for the coming Christmas. All 
she felt was fear. Deep fear she didn&#39;t even feel when they found the 
talismans andalmost died. When Sailor Saturn wanted to sacrifice 
herself for the world and Sailor Moon almost missed to transform 
herself. When the rude man wanted to kill her Himme-chan and took her 
instead of her money. This fear was stronger and it increased like the 
nausea she felt almost every morning now. She could hardly eat 
anything without throwing it up afterwards. Michiru didn&#39;t mention, 
because she had to stood up earlier than her. And every time Haruka 
wanted to tell her the smaller senshi was in such a hurry or there 
wasn&#39;t the right place to tell her.

Haruka lowered her head and closed her burning eyes.

What shall I do when I am never able to tell her at all?

***

It was cold in the white room. She froze and automatically pulled the 
sleeves of her wide dark pullover over her icy hands. The older woman 
looked at her with a concerned expression on her face, frowned and 
sighed deeply. They had talked for over an hour now and silence 
surrounded them for another one.

&quot;You know what it means?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re sure that you want to do it?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;I mean, really, really sure.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;It will change your life forever. Do you know the consequences?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

Please, think it over. Four days are a long time. Talk to other people 
and imagine how your life will be after you made your decision.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;And change your mind, for heaven&#39;s sake!&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

Haruka rose from her chair, bowed slightly before the doctor and went 
away. Holding a crumbled paper tight in her trembling hands.

***

As always Rei was haunting Usagi through the whole house. They got 
used to it. And to a crazy cook, a crazy organisator and a crazy 
violinist.

Haruka sighed deeply as she sat down in front of her piano. She opened 
it and her hands touched the keys. But she wasn&#39;t able to play. Tears 
burned in her deep green eyes as she looked at her trembling hands. 
But she simply wasn&#39;t able to play melodies that once had made sense. 
No they were all too happy, too loving. Too unreal.

&quot;Michi-chan&#39;s at the opera?&quot; asked the senshi without looking up as 
the door was opened. Ami sneaked into the room and it was one of the 
few times when she didn&#39;t wear a heavy book in her hands.

&quot;Hai.&quot; Answered the senshi of the water and frowned. Haruka looked so 
strange today. So sad. So lonely.

So alone...

Ami swallowed hard and came nearer. There were no notes on the piano 
and she asked herself why the young car racer didn&#39;t play the 
instrument anymore. Why she didn&#39;t want to accompany her Michiru in 
her concerts this year as she always had done at Christmas.

&quot;I shall greet you for her and say that she won&#39;t be at home before 
dawn.&quot; Automatically both looked out of the huge windows. It was 
already dark outside. Both sighed slightly. &quot;Hope we don&#39;t annoy you 
changing your whole house into a big festival. But you know Mina-chan. 
You can&#39;t hinder her when she has her ideas. And Makoto already filled 
your fridge, I thought it was going to explode.&quot; Ami giggled but 
Haruka didn&#39;t even smile.

&quot;Michiru said that she&#39;s very sorry  and that she&#39;ll take more time 
for you after the concerts.&quot;

The senshi of the wind nodded thoughtfully, her hands still resting on 
the keys. Motionless. Then they heard how an exited voice shouted for 
Ami from downstairs. The senshi of the water hesitated. But then there 
were another impatient voice demanding for her. She glanced shortly at 
Haruka and shrugged helpless her shoulders.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Ami. Help them before they&#39;re burning down the house and 
we have to celebrate Christmas at the snowy beach.&quot; Said Haruka and 
turned her face away. So that the younger senshi couldn&#39;t see the 
tears sparkling in her eyes. Tears she couldn&#39;t hold back any longer.

&quot;If you need anything, Haruka, just tell. We&#39;re your friends.&quot; Ami 
placed her hands on the taller woman&#39;s shoulders and squeezed them 
tight for some seconds. Then she went away and closed the door 
silently behind her.

In that very moment Haruka covered her burning face with her icy hands 
and couldn&#39;t held back a desperate sob.

She gasped hard for breathe and her whole body trembled.

Maybe it&#39;s better that way.

The young car racer sat there for a very long time. Motionless. Unable 
to think of anything than the appointment she had with the doctor. 
Soon. Maybe it&#39;s better for Michiru that she never got to know about 
it.

Haruka swallowed and knew that it would be very hard for her without 
her girlfriend&#39;s help. Without her understanding words. Without her 
comforting gestures. Without her love.

And suddenly the strong senshi of the wind wasn&#39;t sure if she was able 
to survive it all alone.

I have no other choice...

Haruka lowered her head and simply let her tears fall. No one heard 
her desperate sobs. No one hold her tight.

***

Her alarm clock interrupted her dreams and she almost fell out of her 
bed. Michiru reached over to it and slammed it with a tortured 
expression on her tired face. She rubbed her eyes and turned around to 
look at her girlfriend. She liked it to watch her lover sleep. Deep 
and tight. Without any nightmares haunting her down. Not as long as 
she was with her.

But the bed was empty beside her. Haruka was gone.

I didn&#39;t remember that there was any training with the guys.

Michiru frowned as she left the bed and went slowly into the bathroom. 
A very tired face greeted her out of the mirror and Michiru turned 
away quickly. She felt like she had run a long way and she knew that 
the busy time wasn&#39;t over yet. Christmas was in two days and tonight 
would be another concert.

I still don&#39;t have all presents.

She opened the wardrobe to took out a new towel. A fresh shower would 
help her to awake a little bit more. She didn&#39;t want to cause an 
accident when she tried to get to the opera because she fell asleep. 
She felt weak and guilty. She only saw her Ruka when she sneaked into 
the bedroom late at night or even early in the morning. It seemed as 
if Haruka wanted to talk to her. About something important. But she 
simply didn&#39;t have the time and when she came home she didn&#39;t want to 
wake her lover up.

She looks so cute when she sleeps. So innocent.

Mostly the young violinist was gone before her lover awoke and the 
whole chaos started again.

Hopefully she forgives me for my lack of time.

Michiru grabbed energetically the towel as it didn&#39;t want to come out 
of the wardrobe and almost flew against the next wall as she hold it 
suddenly in her hands. It cracked as something hit the tiled ground 
and Michiru picked it up to put it away.

As she saw the cover, read the few lines, she froze in motion. She 
frowned as she opened the package and gasped hard for breathe as she 
saw the red sign. Her eyes widened and suddenly she knew what Haruka 
wanted to tell her so badly during the past days.

I baka...

Michiru swallowed hard and slowly went on her knees. The towel landed 
somewhere next to her on the ground but she didn&#39;t mention it. She 
looked at the sign again and again until she was sure that she 
understood what it meant. With trembling hands she closed the package 
again and almost screamed as she saw her lover&#39;s shaky writing on the 
paper. Haruka had written down the name of the hospital and a date. 
And a time. Michiru looked at her watch and her eyes widened even 
more. Now they were filled with tears while she got to her feet as if 
she was beaten by lightening. The package fell unseen on the towel as 
she returned into the sleeping room and opened all their wardrobes. 
Her whole body trembled as she took some warm winter clothes outside 
and pulled them over herself without stripping the blue night dress. 
She didn&#39;t brush her hairs, only knotted them together with a 
determined motion. Then she run over to her daughter&#39;s room. Not 
mentioning that tears were running down her suddenly pale cheeks. 
Again she looked at her watch and shook her head fiercely. She can&#39;t 
do it. Michiru sobbed slightly as she woke her daughter up.

She can&#39;t do it. Not all alone..

***

&quot;Nani?&quot; Usagi yawned and looked surprised at Michiru who handled her 
an almost sleeping Hotaru.

&quot;Please, baby-sit her for today. It&#39;s very import.&quot; Said the young 
violinist and Usagi could see that the taller woman had been crying. 
Her hairs were messed and her clothes looked crumbled. And they didn&#39;t 
fit together. The colours looked strange. A light green with a dark 
yellow and an ugly grey.

&quot;Michiru! What happened!&quot; she demanded to know but the senshi of the 
wide ocean already returned to the parking silver Ferrari and Usagi 
didn&#39;t get another answer than the roaring of the engine as Michiru 
drove away.

As fast as Haruka always did on the race track.

***

Why am I sitting here?

She stared at the newspaper in her hands without really seeing it. A 
small bag laid on the ground of the waiting room, touched her 
trembling legs.

What am I doing here?

Haruka closed her eyes and clenched her fists. She made her decision 
that day she got to know about it. It wasn&#39;t a good decision and she 
wasn&#39;t sure if she would be able to live with the consequences. But it 
was the best decision she found. The decision that seemed to be fair 
for herself.

And for the other person.

Do I really want to go over to that room and simply let it happen?

She bowed her head and sighed deeply. She didn&#39;t want to look up 
again. To see the pregnant woman sitting next to her. With her husband 
by her side. They both looked so happy. They talked the whole time 
about their unborn child and what they would give it. They talked 
about the baby clothes, about the cradle and about the baptism. Haruka 
wanted to put her hands over her ears so that she wasn&#39;t forced 
anymore to listen to their happy whispers.

But she couldn&#39;t move. She was simply to weak to.

Am I really weak? Am I a coward?

She didn&#39;t know. All she knew was that she would never be able to love 
it. That she would hate it for something that wasn&#39;t it&#39;s fault. And 
that she didn&#39;t want it to feel her angry feelings towards it.

&quot;Ten&ocirc; Haruka?&quot; she heard the nurse&#39;s voice and slowly raised her head. 
Her eyes were dry but her face was as white as the wall behind her. 
She grabbed her bag and slowly, very slowly came to her feet. The 
nurse smiled at her and she wondered is she would ever be able to 
smile such a nice smile again in her whole life.

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; The nurse waited patiently for her and how she stood 
there made sure that she would hold the patient if the young woman 
would faint.

Am I ready?

Haruka sighed deeply as she left the waiting room.

She didn&#39;t find an answer.

***

Half an hour too late!

Michiru pushed the door open and stumbled over her own feet. She 
almost crashed into a palm tree that stood next to the reception. Her 
hands slammed hard the board and an astonished nurse looked up.

&quot;Can I help you?&quot; she asked and smiled friendly up at her. She ignored 
the messed hairs, the crumbled clothes and the wild looks of the young 
woman. This was a hospital. Most of the people looked that way. During 
her long years as a nurse she got used to it. She got to know that the 
appearance didn&#39;t tell anything about the person behind it.

&quot;Ten&ocirc; Haruka...&quot; gasped the young woman and suddenly tears were 
running down her cheeks. &quot;Is she here?&quot;

Then she started desperately to sob and lowered her head. Her 
shoulders trembled and she simply couldn&#39;t calm herself down.

Half an hour too late! It&#39;s all my fault! Because of those silly 
tests! Of those stupid concerts! She wanted to tell me. And I didn&#39;t 
listen...

&quot;Hai, her appointment started at nine.&quot; The nurse left the reception 
and ran over to the young woman as she went on her knees. She covered 
her face with her hands and the car keys jingled as they fell upon the 
soft carped that covered the whole practise.

Damned! Too late!

&quot;Hey, young lady! Can I help you?&quot; The nurse looked concerned at her 
and shrugged her shoulders as the doctor came out of her room. Of 
course she heard the sobs, too. Although the young woman and her 
husband spoke very loudly about their unborn child. About their son. 
About the brother for their five year old girl. Dr. Sagurasa frowned 
as she recognized the young woman. She had seen her once. Now it was 
almost two months ago but she still remembered her. How she had been 
so concerned about her girlfriend in the hospital.

&quot;Calm yourself down, Kaioh-san.&quot; The old woman went on her knees and 
handled the still crying young woman a handkerchief. Tear filled blue 
eyes looked desperately into understanding dark ones. The doctor 
smiled and laid one hand on the shaking shoulders. She really loves 
her. That&#39;s good. Maybe she has the powers the other believes she 
lost.

&quot;Ten&ocirc;-san was here. She came into my room, thanked me for my help, 
took her jacket and left the hospital.&quot; The doctor had been really 
relieved when she saw the young woman go. The whole night the old 
woman had different nightmares because she was sure that this step 
would have destroyed the other one&#39;s life forever.

&quot;She didn&#39;t want my help today. And I hope that I can help her in a 
complete different way when I&#39;ll see her the next time again.&quot; The 
doctor smiled understanding at the still crying young woman and 
automatically started to stroke the sea green hairs. As if the senshi 
of the wide ocean was her daughter.

&quot;Be strong for her.&quot;

Michiru only nodded.

*** 

Wind played with the strands of her short blonde hairs that weren&#39;t 
covered by her black cap. Snow flakes danced through the air like 
little ballet dancers. The beach was covered with snow and looked 
strangely white. Still the waves of the sea touched it but they 
couldn&#39;t free it from it&#39;s blanket anymore. Some floes swam slowly 
over the surface and the ocean looked as dark as the grey sky above. 
It doesn&#39;t look as if it would stop snowing during the next days and 
whole Japan was happy over a white Christmas. The first one after five 
long years.

Two dark green eyes stared blank at the moving ocean, watched how some 
sea birds tried to catch their lunch between the cold waters.

Haruka sat in the snow. She didn&#39;t mention the bitter cold that 
surrounded her. She didn&#39;t mention that her trouser became slowly wet. 
And she didn&#39;t mention the silver car that stopped with a high voice. 
As if someone stepped very hard on the brakes. Haruka&#39;s right hand was 
clenched in the snow while her left one rested under her black jacket. 
Touching her still slim belly. Wondering if that decision had been the 
right one.

I am such a coward!

Tears shimmered in her eyes and she winced badly as someone suddenly 
embraced her from behind. Hold her determined tight as she wanted to 
stand up. To escape. To run away forever.

&quot;Gomen nasai, Ruka. Please, forgive me that I didn&#39;t...&quot; whispered 
Michiru with a shaky voice and sobbed quietly. Haruka smiled a sad 
smile and reached for those soft hands and leaded them under her 
jacket. Let them touch her belly. Swallowed hard as Michiru started to 
stroke it.

&quot;Hope you&#39;ll have time now, &#39;cause there&#39;s something very important 
I&#39;ve got to tell you.&quot; She declared with a quiet voice and heard a 
shaky laughter.

&quot;There won&#39;t be any concerts nor tests in the next days.&quot; Answered 
Michiru and leaned her head against her lover&#39;s shoulder, still 
stroking over the slim belly. Knowing that it would arche within the 
next months.

&quot;I am pregnant, Michi-chan.&quot; Haruka took a deep breathe. It was the 
first time that she admitted it to herself. That she spoke it out 
aloud. That she knew that it was true. &quot;Pregnant from that asshole...&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Michiru sighed deeply. &quot;I&#39;ve been at the hospital half an 
hour ago.&quot;

For a long time Haruka didn&#39;t respond anything. She didn&#39;t ask why 
Michiru suddenly knew it. She simply sat there and enjoyed the soft 
touches of her lover. The woman she loved more than anyone else. The 
woman who understood her. Who would never leave her.

&quot;I made that appointment shortly after I made a pregnancy test and it 
was positive.&quot; Haruka lowered her head and shook it slightly. &quot;I had 
been so afraid of the AIDS test that I simply forgot that I could get 
pregnant. Because there&#39;s no way for two women... and I didn&#39;t think 
much as I didn&#39;t had my period. I was so scared of being infected by 
AIDS and never be able to have a future with you and Himme-chan, that 
I ignored the signs.  Hell, I threw up my dinner every morning and 
felt really ill, but I thought that it was only the stress...&quot; Again 
Haruka shook her head. 

&quot;When I got to know about it, I only wanted to get rid of it. I really 
wanted to abort it. Today was the doctor&#39;s appointment for the 
abortion and I thought it was the best solution. For me - and for the 
child. Because I&#39;ll never be able to love it. Maybe it looks like him 
and every time I&#39;ll look at it I&#39;ll think of him and how he... how he 
hurt me so much. I&#39;d hate it the rest of my life and I didn&#39;t want 
such a bad destiny for that poor child. It wasn&#39;t it&#39;s fault, was what 
I thought.&quot; Haruka swallowed and looked back at the endless sea, still 
feeling Michiru&#39;s warm hands on her belly. Now they slipped under her 
dark pullover and stroke over the soft skin under it. &quot;Then I looked 
at the doctor and knew that she was right. It wasn&#39;t it&#39;s fault. Why 
shall I punish it for something that it&#39;s... it&#39;s producer did to me? 
We got a second chance from Sailor Moon and Himme-chan even a second 
life. Why shouldn&#39;t I give it the chance to live? There&#39;re many people 
out there who want badly to have their own children but aren&#39;t able to 
get them. There&#39;re so many loving parents in spe out there who would 
adopt it - and love it. With a love I can&#39;t give it.&quot; 

Michiru raised her head and tears were running down her cheeks. She 
squeezed her lover tighter. &quot;Think about it, Ruka. You&#39;ve got nine 
months time, sweetheart.&quot; The senshi of the wide ocean whispered and 
her hands rested motionless on the still slime belly. Warming. 
Healing.

&quot;Seven months.&quot; Corrected Haruka and sighed deeply. &quot;Maybe I am a 
coward but I simply couldn&#39;t kill it.&quot; She sighed again a shaky, husky 
sigh. She felt how Michiru embraced her tighter. She heard those soft 
words in her ears and knew that they were true.

&quot;I love you, Ruka.&quot;

They sat there for another long while and when they finally went back 
to the silver Ferrari they still hold each other&#39;s hand tight.

***

&quot;I am dreaming of a white Christmas...&quot;

Minako stood in the middle of the living room near the chimney and 
sung with all her passion. The other senshi sat around the already set 
table and listened to her or simply accompanied her. Even Makoto 
forgot about her dinner for a few moments and listened to the 
beautiful voice of the senshi of love.

I could listen to her the whole evening.

Not only she thought it. But they all knew that there was a delicious 
dinner waiting for them. And a lot of gifts.

Chibiusa had wrapped her arms around Hotaru. The little girl looked 
with her big dark eyes at the huge Christmas tree and at the candles 
sparkling all over it. She didn&#39;t understand what Christmas meant but 
she knew very well what the coloured presents meant under the tree. A 
smile laid on her face and she giggled as Chibiusa whispered something 
in her ear.

Soon the song was over and they decided for nice, silent music for the 
background. They all applauded and Minako bowed with a happy grin on 
her face.

One day I&#39;ll be a great singer. And a great actor. Then I&#39;ll be a 
star.

No one doubt it.

&quot;I am so curious about my gifts!&quot; said Usagi as they all sat down 
around the table. Only Makoto and Ami ran between kitchen and 
living-room the carry the food to the table. The rest wanted to help 
them but they declared determined that two women were enough. And that 
they didn&#39;t want anything to waste on the nice carpet.

&quot;You are so greedy.&quot; Scolded Rei and again they showed each other 
their tongues.

&quot;Girls! Please!&quot; Mamoru rolled his eyes but returned the knowing smile 
of Michiru. The young woman reached for her lover&#39;s icy hands under 
the table and they both exchanged short glances. Then Michiru stood 
up, took Hotaru in her arms said something of a surprise and left with 
the two children the living-room.

&quot;I am not greedy! After all it&#39;s enough food for all of us.&quot; Replied 
Usagi and showed at the first bowls that stood on the table.

&quot;It would be enough for us. But I am not sure if it&#39;s enough for you!&quot; 
The young priest showed again her tongue and both rose and haunted 
around the table. Being scolded by Makoto who tried to get the rest of 
the food on the table. The roast was still missing and one bowl with 
rice Ami balanced concentrated in her hands.

Haruka took a deep breathe.

Now or never.

&quot;I... I&#39;ve got to tell you something.&quot; Said the senshi of the wind but 
wasn&#39;t heard because of the shouting of the girls. &quot;I...&quot; she took 
another deep breathe and was thankful as Mamoru rose from his chair 
and said with a determined voice that they all should be quiet now. He 
had seen something in Haruka&#39;s eyes that made him shiver. That made 
him know that she wanted to tell them something really important. 
Usagi made a face as if she would start to cry in the next moment and 
Ami frowned as she balanced the hot bowl.

&quot;You&#39;re my best friends.&quot; Haruka started and swallowed hard. Suddenly 
she wasn&#39;t able to look in several loving pairs of sparkling eyes any 
longer. She grabbed her knife and played thoughtless with it. &quot;No, 
you&#146;re not only my friends. You&#39;re the Sailor Team, my family and you 
should know it. Well, you&#39;ll know it in some months and it&#39;s simply 
fair to tell you before you ask stupid questions.&quot; Haruka took another 
deep breathe and looked finally up again. She looked directly into 
blue shinning eyes and the senshi of love smiled friendly at her.

&quot;I am pregnant.&quot;

Now it was out. The reaction was like a bomb exploding in the 
living-room. There was impenetrable silence and all stared at the 
young woman in disbelieve.

Shall I congratulate her? 

Mamoru frowned as he looked at the young car racer. But Haruka didn&#39;t 
look like a happy becoming mother.

And where was Michiru? Why looked the senshi of the wind so sad? So 
depressed?

The silence ended abrupt as the bowl escaped Ami&#39;s trembling hands. It 
cracked as it hit the ground and hot rice covered the white carpet in 
front of her feet. The senshi of the water remembered too well the 
sadness that seemed to surround the taller woman during the past 
weeks. She heard the shaky voice again in her head, saw the young car 
racer again sitting alone at the black piano.

No. It can&#39;t be true.

But the genius knew that it was.

&quot;The date of birth is on July the 10th.&quot; Whispered Haruka and 
swallowed hard. She lowered her head so that she didn&#39;t has to look 
into worried dark eyes any longer. Setsuna frowned and ask herself why 
she didn&#39;t mention it.

&quot;How...?&quot; asked Rei surprised and several pairs of surprised eyes 
looked at Usagi who only shook her head.

&quot;I didn&#39;t misuse my powers. Hai, I am Sailor Moon and I am the future 
Queen of Crystal Tokyo, but I don&#39;t think that I am that powerful.&quot; 
She shrugged her shoulders and Makoto silently helped Ami to tidy up 
the messed rice.

&quot;Well, then, my congratulations to you and Michiru.&quot; Mamoru came over 
to her and shook a icy hand. A trembling hand.

&quot;Do you already know what it will be? Will Hotaru has a baby brother 
or a baby sister?&quot; Minako started to smile and Rei laughed as she 
heard Makoto&#39;s teasing words.

&quot;Where&#39;s the list for the future aunts to sign in for the 
baby-sitting?&quot;

&quot;July? That are seven months now. You&#39;re still slim. But soon one will 
see it.&quot; Declared Ami and swallowed hard. &quot;I read in a book that...&quot;

&quot;You always read things in a book.&quot; Makoto rolled her eyes.

&quot;Hai, our living library. A real competition for you, Setsuna. So if 
you ever have a question just ask Ami.&quot;

&quot;Rei!&quot;

&#147;May I sing a song for it when it&#146;s going to sleep?&#148;

&#147;Just let her be born first, Mina-chan!&#148;

&#147;Hai, and we want it to fall asleep not to start terrified to scream 
because of your singing.&#148;

&#147;My voice is nice. You&#146;ll regret this!&#148;

&#147;But I read in a book...&#148;

&#147;Ami!&#148;

Suddenly they teased themselves around as ever and Haruka was relieved 
about their reaction. She had await worse. No one asked who the father 
was. They simply accepted that the child she was caring was also 
Michiru&#39;s child.

The young car racer smiled slightly and looked over to Michiru who 
stepped back into the room. She was alone. The kids were still at the 
child&#39;s room. Playing with a card play the young violinist gave them 
some minutes ago. But they didn&#39;t count on Usagi&#39;s stupidity.

&quot;How could this happen?&quot; asked the future Queen of Crystal Tokyo and 
the arguments died away at the next moment. They all stared at 
everything but the young woman who was very pale with a sudden.

&quot;I didn&#39;t misuse my powers and I am good enough in biology to know 
that it&#39;s impossible for two woman to have their own child on the 
natural way.&quot; Usagi looked innocently asking at Haruka. That look 
almost drove her crazy. She swallowed hard and felt how she blushed. 
Deeply blushed. Hard she fought against her tears and finally won the 
battle. She didn&#39;t know for how long.

&quot;How could you do it? I mean becoming pregnant?&quot; Usagi frowned but she 
ignored the warning looks of her boyfriend. Maybe she didn&#39;t see them. 
Maybe she didn&#39;t even realize how stupid her own questions were. How 
superfluous. They all wanted to be happy about the new life that would 
be born in the next summer. To be happy with the becoming parents. 
They all knew that it wasn&#39;t their task to ask after the how and the 
why. They all knew that it was a great honour that they got to know 
about it before it was obviously. That the two outer senshi trusted 
them so much that they told them - at Christmas Eve. That they really 
wanted them to be the aunts of the new member of their great, lively 
family.

But Usagi didn&#39;t think that much. Maybe her words weren&#39;t meant the 
way she asked so silly. Maybe she was simply too surprised. And a 
little bit curious. And Haruka didn&#39;t think about it, too. That she 
knew the always crying girl for a long time now. Almost three years. 
That she knew that it was Usagi&#39;s style to ask such stupid questions. 
That she didn&#39;t want to hurt her by asking them. That she only wanted 
to be happy with her friends.

&quot;How...&quot;

Haruka rose from her chair and interrupted another stupid question of 
her future Queen. Tears sparkled in her eyes as she yelled at Usagi.

&quot;I slept with a man, you baka! What did you think?!&quot; She took a deep 
breathe, then she turned away and went into the kitchen. Slowly she 
went to her knees and opened the oven. The roast smelled delicious but 
she wasn&#39;t hungry any more. Nor did she know if she would eat anything 
when she had to throw it all up again the next morning.

&quot;But...&quot; Now Usagi looked very confused and started frightened to cry. 
Mamoru took her into his strong arms and they all looked quietly at 
Michiru who only nodded. All bowed their heads as they understood the 
unspoken words.

Michiru moved first. She went over to the kitchen and kneeled behind 
her girlfriend and embraced her trembling body. She didn&#39;t say 
anything. She didn&#39;t need to. Haruka understood her without many 
words. She simply leaned herself against her lover and winced slightly 
as Michiru touched gently her still slim belly.

Someone put on the CD player and soft Christmas music evolved from the 
living room. Dishes jingled and someone scolded another one softly by 
tumbling over a glass. A filled glass. Filled with apple juice. 
Suddenly action returned into the inner senshi and Ami ran into the 
kitchen, fetched cursing a towel and disappeared back into the living 
room. They heard how Usagi stopped to cry and how Rei enflamed some 
candles at the table with her powers. Usagi screamed as Rei tried to 
burn her, too, with another really tiny fireball.

&#147;Hey, that&#146;s my task.&#148; Makoto came over to the still kneeling outer 
senshi and kneeled down next to them. So all the three of them looked 
into the oven. At the brown roast.

&#147;It smells delicious.&#148; Whispered Haruka after a long while but didn&#146;t 
look up.

&#147;You did a good work, Mako-chan.&#148; Agreed Michiru and smiled into an 
understanding face.

&#147;Arigato.&#148; Makoto took the roast out of the oven and at the huge 
kitchen table. Then she turned again to the two outer senshi. Her long 
brown plaid fell on her right shoulder as she bowed over them so that 
she could look directly into two pale faces.

&#147;Congratulations, you two. Whatever happened, it&#146;s your child.&#148; She 
giggled a little bit and blinked at them.

&#147;Hope it&#146;s strong enough to survive us aunts.&#148; She pointed over to the 
living-room where a wild priest was haunting a screaming Usagi. Then 
Makoto reached for two icy hands and tried to help the outer senshi 
up.

&#147;Today&#146;s Christmas. The festival of love. We should celebrate it and 
be happy about the things we have and stop to moan about the things we 
don&#146;t. After all we have Mina-chan to party. This is a happy evening 
and we should enjoy it. Arigato, you two, that we are allowed to 
celebrate it here &#150; with you.&#148;

Haruka and Michiru smiled back at her and nodded. They knew how much 
this Christmas meant for Makoto. Her parents died some years ago and 
she had been very lonely before she got to know the Sailor Team. She 
enjoyed every minute she could spend with them.

Slowly they entered the living-room again and although Haruka felt 
like she had to cry she burst out into laughter. Rei laid near the 
Christmas tree. Some silver sparkling balls covered her dark hairs and 
she hold a burning candle in each hand. Angry she stared up at Usagi 
who stumbled over a gift and laid next to her. She was covered with a 
blanket she seized on. Minako stood between them, a spoon in her hand, 
and commented what happened. Only Mamoru rolled his eyes, but he had 
to smile, too. Especially as he heard the low laughter he had to admit 
he missed during the past weeks.

&#147;The judges aren&#146;t sure yet who won the race. But they surely will get 
great notes. We&#146;re still waiting for a judgement. Maybe 5.9? Or even 
6.0? Who will win it? Both jumps were graceful and full of movement. 
Will Usako win who stumbled with so much passion over a gift? Or Rei 
who fell almost in slow motion over the laying girl? How she reached 
for the candles and then the balls landing on her black hairs &#150; that 
was genial!&#148; Minako giggled wild as she heard several mumbles from the 
fallen senshi underneath. It sounded like &gt;Kill you!&lt; and &gt;Free me!&lt;. 
Ami had put her book aside and climbed at one chair and rose a sign 
pointing a 6.0.

&#147;Amazing! That&#146;s the first time after five years that we see a 6.0!&#148; 
explained Minako exited then they all burst out into laughter. Michiru 
gently touched her lover&#146;s hands and was happy to see her not so sad 
anymore. For the first time after over two months now.

After they finished their comments, Minako and Ami helped the other 
senshi up.

&#147;Okay, Ami, you&#146;ll fetch the girls, I&#146;ll fetch the roast. And the rest 
sit down, again.&#148; Makoto observed shortly the set table and pulled 
away the now wet towel. It smelled of apple juice.

&#147;Haruka?&#148; Light blue eyes looked guilty up into dark green ones.

&#147;I...&#148; Usagi looked as if she would start to cry again and she plucked 
at her white dress she was wearing today. Because it was Christmas. &#147;I 
didn&#146;t want to hurt you. Sometimes I am such a baka and...&#148; She 
shrugged her shoulders and a relieved smile appeared on her face as 
Haruka slightly shook her head.

&#147;It&#146;s okay, Usako. I wasn&#146;t that nice, too.&#148; Before she could react 
the future Queen of Crystal Tokyo had embraced her. Then Usagi turned 
around and pointed at the gifts.

&#147;The big one&#146;s for me. I already read the sign on it.&#148; She declared 
and Haruka had to giggle as she saw light blue eyes sparkling.

It&#146;s amazing how she kept so innocent through those rough times with 
Mistress 9. How she could save our world, how she could rescue 
Himme-chan without ever losing her faith in the people around her.

Sometimes Haruka envied her &#150; even for her stupidy.

Maybe that&#146;s why she&#146;s our future Queen. Because she never gave up. 
Always she fought for the people she loves. She cares about a lot. 

The senshi of the wind sat down next to her lover and looked into the 
flame of a candle.

Maybe I should think of her each time I am down. To see how she 
survived all those terrible times knowing that there&#146;s still some 
hope, as long as there&#146;s still some will to fight.

&#147;Love you.&#148; Whispered Michiru and gave her a short but loving kiss and 
of course Usagi wanted a kiss from her Mamoru who blushed deeply. And 
of course Makoto returned from kitchen with a delicious smelling, huge 
roast in her hands.  And of course Ami entered the living-room with 
two exited children. Looking curiously at the tree asking when it was 
the right time to get their presents. 

Makoto is right.

Haruka watched how they all talked happily at the table about 
different things. How they all laughed, ate and looked more than once 
at the still wrapped gifts. Hotaru climbed on her daddy&#146;s lap and 
enjoyed it to be fed by her. 

I should be happy for the things I have. Not moaning over the things I 
don&#146;t. I can&#146;t change.

***

It was late at night. A special night. Christmas night. It was four 
o&#146;clock and they celebrated very long. After midnight the two children 
slept deep and tight on the soft couch. Chibiusa had wrapped her arms 
around Hotaru and Usagi smiled like a loving mother down at them as 
she covered their small bodies with a warm blanket.

They talked the whole evening while they unwrapped curiously their own 
presents. Usagi almost screamed of joy when she saw the nice ring her 
Mamoru gave her. It was golden with a sparkling jewel. It shimmered in 
all colours of the rainbow in the dimmed candlelight. Ami got a big 
dictionary and for the rest of the evening she didn&#146;t mention anything 
else then the lines in the book. She only put it away and thanked the 
outer senshi of the soft scarf Michiru had knotted for her. It was a 
light blue with fishes all over it. And she laughed over Minako who 
gave her a pink unicorn who could really neigh.

&#147;For my genius. You&#146;re always so serious.&#148; Declared the senshi of love 
while Ami let the tiny horse gallop over the carpet they were sitting 
at. In front of the chimney. Feeling the warm flames next to them.

Rei made special talismans for them and was very happy about the 
t-shirt Makoto gave her. It was black with a huge fireball in the 
middle. In fire letters was written above: Stop me and I&#146;ll burn you. 
Rei laughed until she had to cry and of course she wore it the whole 
evening. With pride. It was such a nice evening.

Haruka yawned and sat down on her bed. The rest of the senshi slept 
downstairs in the guest room. Only Chibiusa insisted to sleep with her 
Hotaru in the child&#146;s room.

Now it was silent again at the light house by the sea. The candles 
were switched off but you could still smell the roast. The smoke of 
the flames. Time by time you could hear how a senshi sneaked over the 
corridor. To the kitchen to drink something. Or to the toilette. Or 
simply to the living-room again to look again at her present. And to 
know that they would celebrate a nice Sylvester in about one week. 
With her friends, too.

&#147;They&#146;re very good friends.&#148; Said Michiru and changed into her night 
dress. Haruka already wore her pyjama and sat on her bed, watching at 
the moon shinning through the window. The world was white outside and 
the feeling of Christmas could calm her nerves down. She felt as if 
she was a little child again. Five years. When her parents still loved 
her. Before they left her. When she had been happy.

That was such a long time before I met my Michi-chan.

&#147;Hai...&#148;

&#147;Guess that was the last festival you got normal presents. Guess 
they&#146;ll give you other things to the next celebration like your 
birthday.&#148;

&#147;Then I am 21 and I am able to become president.&#148;

Haruka felt how Michiru climbed on the bed and embraced her from 
behind. Something crackled and she asked if Michiru really wanted to 
take her new evening dress with her into the bed as she threaded 
laughing about three hours ago.

&#147;My little president.&#148; Teased Michiru and the senshi of the wind felt 
soft kisses that covered her neck. She shivered and hold a tiny gift 
the next moment in her hands. &#147;I didn&#146;t want to give it to you under 
the tree. It&#146;s a little bit personal.&#148; Whispered Michiru and 
automatically hold her girlfriend tighter as Haruka unwrapped it. Her 
hands trembled suddenly and she stared in disbelieve at the tiny baby 
pyjama. It was dark blue with moons and stars sparkling all over it. 
Haruka swallowed hard and slightly shook her head. She felt how 
Michiru pulled her closer to herself. She knew what that cloths in her 
hands meant. She knew the promise her lover gave her with it. Haruka 
took a shaky breathe and didn&#146;t know how to react. Didn&#146;t know what to 
say as she heard the tender voice whispering behind her.

&#147;What ever will happen, Ruka, I&#146;ll be there.&#148;
