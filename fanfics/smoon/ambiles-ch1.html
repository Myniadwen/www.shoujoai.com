***Tonight&#39;s Episode: You Couldn&#39;t Eat Your Way Out of a Cardboard Box***

[Scene opens in a dark throne room.  Seated in the throne is Prince 
Diamond, who is surrounded by his Dark Moon minions.  The door 
opposite Diamond&#39;s throne slides open and in walks Black Lady.]

DIAMOND: Ah, Black Lady.  Tell me, what news from the front?

BLACK LADY: Our forces are massing, Your Highness.  Soon we will be 
able to conquer Tokyo.  The only thing that stands in our way is that 
insufferable duo, Haruka and Michiru!

DIAMOND: Yes, they have always thwarted our plans in the past.  But my 
latest plan will finish them once and for all!

BLACK LADY: What plan, Prince?

DIAMOND: We will strike against Tokyo with too many minions for them 
to stop, leading them to believe the only way to save their city is to 
stop the source of the invasion.  We lure them here, and then I seduce 
them with my manly charms!

BLACK LADY: (staring) Uh, with all due respect, Prince Diamond, I 
don&#39;t think that plan will work.

DIAMOND: Why not?

BLACK LADY: Isn&#39;t it obvious?  Haruka and Michiru are *lesbians*!

MINION: Yeah, I&#39;ve never seen a bigger pair of lesbians!

DIAMOND: What do you mean, they&#39;re lesbians?

BLACK LADY: Didn&#39;t you see the last episode?  The little one was 
riding the big one like a rocking horse!

DIAMOND: No, I missed it.

MINION: Aren&#39;t they also cousins or something?

BLACK LADY: Oh, come on.  They like Indigo Girls!

DIAMOND: Liking Indigo Girls makes you gay?

[Prince Diamond shifts in his throne to block his CD collection from 
Black Lady&#39;s view.]

[Meanwhile, at a Tokyo fitness club...]

MICHIRU: Work it, Haruka!

HARUKA: You got it, lifetime companion!

[Haruka and Michiru are wearing gray spandex body suits with bright 
yellow trim, blue-and-black masks over their eyes, and have a large 
&quot;H&quot; and &quot;M&quot; on their chests, and are currently engaged in a VERY 
suggestive boxing match.  Twenty or thirty fanboys are watching with 
their mouths hanging wide open.]

HARUKA: What&#39;s everybody looking at?

CROWD: Nothing!

[Suddenly, the phone rings.  Michiru pulls it out of some unseen 
pocket and answers it.]

MICHIRU: Hello?

[Scene cuts to Commissioner Chiba&#39;s office.  About half a dozen city 
officials are in there, looking worried.  About two dozen youma can be 
seen in the background, chasing people and smashing things.]

CHIBA: Michiru?  Haruka?  We&#39;ve got one hell of a situation downtown!

MICHIRU: What kind of situation, Commissioner?

CHIBA: Youma are running around down here like it&#39;s some kind of 
amusement park!  This must be the work of Prince Diamond!  We&#39;re 
counting on you to break into his headquarters and stop this madness!

MICHIRU: But sir, Haruka and I were in the middle of our workout!

OFFICIAL: &quot;Workout&quot;?

[Two officials make mocking kissy faces at each other.  Commissioner 
Chiba motions for them to shut up.]

CHIBA: The time for workouts is over, Michiru!  Now is the time for 
action!  If you don&#39;t do something quickly, Tokyo is finished!

MICHIRU: Understood, sir.  You can count on us!  Michiru out.

[Scene cuts back to the gym.]

HARUKA: What was that?

MICHIRU: It&#39;s time to go to work, &#39;Ruka.  Let&#39;s go!

[A turbo-charged car shaped like a female torso breaks through the 
wall and skids to a halt, scaring the crowd of gawkers away.  Two 
breast-shaped bubble domes slide open and the two heroines jump in and 
blast off.  Scene cuts back to Diamond&#39;s throne room.]

DIAMOND: All I&#39;m saying is that with today&#39;s media it&#39;s easy to make 
something *sound* gay when it&#39;s really not.

BLACK LADY: Sure, but with those two?  Give me a break.

MINION: They make Ellen Degeneres and Anne Hesche look like Fred and 
Barney.

DIAMOND: But do you have any *proof* they&#39;re gay?

BLACK LADY: They&#39;re always hanging out in these bars that never have 
any men in them.

DIAMOND: And how would *you* know about that, Black Lady?

BLACK LADY: Hey!  This isn&#39;t about ME!

DIAMOND: Well, there, you see-

[Suddenly, the duo&#39;s car crashes through the wall.  They jump out and 
assume patriotic stances, surprising the Black Moon gang.]

HARUKA: Prince Diamond!  We demand you cease your attack on Tokyo!

MICHIRU: If you don&#39;t stop, we will punish you!

HARUKA: That&#39;s right, friend of friends.

[Haruka pats Michiru&#39;s ass.  Everyone stares.]

HARUKA: What?  Do I have something in my teeth?

[Black Lady glares smugly at Diamond.]

DIAMOND: (whispers to Black Lady) Now, just watch... (aloud, to the 
duo) Well, it seems you&#39;ve somehow managed to find my secret 
headquarters.  I shouldn&#39;t have underestimated a pair of lovely and 
intelligent ladies like yourselves.

HARUKA: Flattery will get you nowhere, Dark Moon sleaze!

BLACK LADY: *See*?

DIAMOND: That doesn&#39;t mean anything!  Youma attack!

[The youma begin to close in on Haruka and Michiru.  The duo fights 
them off with punches, kicks, and shooting lasers out of their eyes.  
The youma fall slowly but surely.]

BLACK LADY: They&#39;re starting to win!

DIAMOND: Oh yeah?  Watch this!

[Diamond pushes a button on a remote control-lookin&#39; thingy and more 
youma appear out of thin air.  Haruka and Michiru soon find themselves 
hopelessly outnumbered.]

MICHIRU: Oh no, Haruka!  There&#39;s too many of them!

HARUKA: Come on, life partner, turbo spin!

[Michiru lies on her back with her knees raised.  Haruka puts her 
knees on either side of Michiru&#39;s head and puts her own head between 
Michiru&#39;s knees.  They begin rolling around like a human tire, gaining 
more and more speed, until they begin knocking youma down like bowling 
pins. Eventually all the youma have been defeated and the duo comes 
out of their roll.  Diamond, Black Lady and the Dark Moon generals 
stare, open-mouthed.]

MICHIRU: Now what&#39;s everybody looking at?

ALL: Nothing!

DIAMOND: You haven&#39;t won yet!

[Diamond pushes his button again and yet more youma appear.  Haruka 
and Michiru are again surrounded.]

HARUKA: Oh no!  What do we do now?

***Tune in for next week&#39;s episode, same ambiguous time, same 
ambiguous channel!***
