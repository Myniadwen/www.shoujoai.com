<h1>Kazeko (part 6 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Makoto held one of Ami&#39;s hands in hers, thumb caressing the shorter 
woman&#39;s smooth skin.  Ami was blushing slightly, eyes flicking to their 
linked hands every so often.
 
She covered Makoto&#39;s hand with hers as their conversation lulled, and 
deep sapphire eyes met sparkling emerald.  &quot;Mako, why . . . why would 
you choose me?&quot;  In that simple question were all of the others that Ami 
could not yet ask, but Makoto understood.  She had always been able to 
hear what Mercury did not say.
 
&quot;I was wondering the same thing, Ami.  I&#39;m not the most feminine of 
women, and I&#39;m so tall&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;That no one wanted to dance with you,&quot; Ami laughed kindly.  &quot;I didn&#39;t 
ever care what anyone else thought, Mako-chan.  I liked you for who you 
were and I danced with my best friend because she was lonely.  You may 
not be all that feminine in the way you act, but you are a very gorgeous 
woman and I know anyone would be honored to have your respect, your 
friendship, your love.  You may be tall, but so is Haruka-san, and she&#39;s 
never had a problem in the love and friendship department.  If you&#39;ll 
remember, she and Michiru-san are getting married.&quot;
 
Makoto smiled as she pulled Ami&#39;s hand up and kissed the sensitive 
inside of her wrist.  &quot;I think that&#39;s what I love the most about you, 
Ami.  You never judge anyone.  You even like Shingo-kun, and that&#39;s a 
miracle!&quot;
 
Ami giggled again.  &quot;Mako, do you think we were . . . lovers back in the 
Silver Millennium, even if we were princesses of our planets and senshi 
in the service of the Moon Princess?&quot;
 
&quot;Setsuna-san says so.&quot;
 
Both women looked up almost guiltily at Rei, and Makoto held Ami&#39;s hand, 
preventing her from pulling it away.  They had no reason to hide, 
especially from their friends.  &quot;Rei-chan!&quot;
 
&quot;Hello, Mako-chan, Ami-chan.  I hope I&#39;m not interrupting anything.  
Actually, as happy as you two looked when I walked by a minute ago, I 
really hope I am.&quot;
 
Makoto grinned, gesturing for Rei to sit as she scooted closer to Ami in 
the booth the senshi always used.  &quot;You know that you are, but we don&#39;t 
mind.  We were going to tell you guys sooner or later, and I imagine you 
are the first person to find out.  Setsuna-san told you that we were 
lovers?  She never tells anyone anything.&quot;
 
Rei grinned.  &quot;You&#39;re right.  She didn&#39;t exactly tell me about you guys; 
I kind of forced it out of her.  I think she&#39;s the one that&#39;s been 
keeping us from remembering our past lives.  When I asked her about it, 
asked if she would do this to Queen Serenity&#39;s daughter, she kind of 
exploded.  I think she and Queen Serenity had a relationship in the 
Silver Millennium, and she seems to have some kind of link to Usagi-chan 
that I can&#39;t figure out.  She did say that we all had lovers but she 
wouldn&#39;t tell me who.&quot;
 
Ami smiled at Makoto, eyes sparkling.  &quot;I know who mine was.&quot;
 
&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;Maybe I don&#39;t want to.  You two fell 
in love without knowing your past, but what if I discover whom I loved 
and only fall in love with them again because of our past?  Would that 
be true love or more like duty?&quot;  She sighed.  &quot;I think I understand why 
Setsuna-san is blocking our memories.  Maybe we even asked her to, in 
the Silver Millennium, because our loves didn&#39;t work out.  After all, if 
it first you don&#39;t succeed, destroy all evidence proving that you tried 
so that you won&#39;t make the same mistakes again.&quot;
 
Makoto took the miko&#39;s hand with her free one and smiled.  &quot;I think if 
we loved someone back then and we fall in love with them again now then 
it&#39;s not because of duty but because we are bound by the red string of 
fate and will always meet and fall in love.  I can&#39;t imagine not wanting 
to remember Ami or the wonders of the Silver Millennium.  All I remember 
about your lover is that your brother most definitely did not approve.&quot;
 
A moment of silence reigned before the three women realized what Makoto 
said.  Mercury and Mars turned to Jupiter, all three with wide eyes.  
&quot;What did you say?  Mako-chan, I&#39;m an only child, like you two, 
Mamoru-san, Michiru-san, Haruka-san, Hotaru-chan, and Minako-chan.  I 
don&#39;t have a brother.&quot;
 
&quot;You did,&quot; Ami whispered, eyes clouding as she desperately tried to get 
past the block in her mind.  Images hung just at the edge of 
comprehension, teasing her.  &quot;We all had siblings.&quot;
 
&quot;I had three brothers&#151;two younger, one older,&quot; Makoto continued.  &quot;What 
about you, Ami?&quot;
 
&quot;I can&#39;t . . . remember.  It&#39;s right there, but I can&#39;t quite reach it.  
I think, twins, younger, a boy and a girl.  Rei-chan? 
 
&quot;I don&#39;t remember anything, not even this brother you speak of.  We have 
to get Setsuna-san to release our memories!  I want to know about my 
life back then.  And my lover.  I want to know who I loved . . .&quot;  She 
whispered the last part, but there was no hiding from her friends.  
Makoto laid her hand on Rei&#39;s shoulder, sympathy in her eyes and an urge 
to end the miko&#39;s pain.
 
The three women looked up at a familiar giggle as Usagi, Mamoru, and 
Minako entered the diner together.  Minako&#39;s eyes met Rei&#39;s, and the 
blonde looked away.  She turned to leave, but Usagi pulled her to the 
table, eager to have all of her friends together again.  That was so 
rare after they graduated High School, even rarer since Galaxia left.  
Makoto and Ami moved further over in the booth, Rei beside Makoto, and 
Minako was pushed in before Usagi and Mamoru slid in.  Minako sat with 
her hands in her lap, and Rei cleared her throat.
 
&quot;I only meant to stop for a moment,&quot; she murmured, her friends straining 
to hear her.  &quot;I really should get back to the shrine.&quot;
 
&quot;You can&#39;t go, Rei-chan!  We&#39;re going over the Haruka-tachi&#39;s house so 
we can be fitted for our bridesmaids&#39; dresses.  They asked us to find 
you and bring you along.&quot;
 
&quot;Usagi, I need to get back.&quot;
 
Usagi pouted, her blue eyes filling with tears, secretly wondering if 
Rei would let herself fall for the old trick or if she would explode as 
she had so long ago.  They hadn&#39;t fought in a very long time, so chances 
were she would give in.  Rei sighed, and the princess knew that she had 
won.  She looked at Ami and Makoto, and her eyes locked on their linked 
hands.  &quot;Mako-chan?  Ami-chan?&quot;
 
The senshi of water blushed, her thunder god partner laughed.  &quot;We would 
have told you sooner or later, Usagi-chan.  Ami and I finally realized 
why we always wanted to spend so much time together.  We&#39;ve fallen in 
love.&quot;  Ami blushed at her girlfriend&#39;s blunt choice of words, but she 
really couldn&#39;t have said it better herself.
 
Usagi&#39;s eyes widened to an almost magical size, and she squealed as she 
leaned over and took her friends&#39; hands.  &quot;I&#39;m so happy for you,&quot; she 
whispered, almost glowing in the light.  She never noticed Rei clench 
her fists under the table, nor did she see Minako look away, tears in 
her light blue eyes.  Not all of her senshi were happy.</pre>
