<p><u>Death Buster  lab</u></p>
<p>“So…Kaolinite is dead? Hmm…” The doctor picked  up the telephone and dialed a new number.</p>
<p><strong>Briiiing,  briiiing.</strong></p>
<p>“Hello, Eudial speaking.”</p>
<p>“Kaolinite  has outlived her usefulness, you’re up.”</p>
<p>“OoOo, I knew  she’d bite the dust one of these days. She was incredibly  useless!”</p>
<p>“Not entirely. We’ve discovered that gathering  pure hearts from surrounding towns won’t shake those sailor senshi  from our backs. Looks like operations will be carried out here  forthwith. I can have the experiment ready for you-“</p>
<p>“If I  may say so, I already have an unique plan that I’m sure you’d  approve of…And a youma is not necessary for it.”</p>
<p>“…Really  now? Saves me some work too…Very well do as you wish. I’ll be  expecting success.”<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Yes doctor.”</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p>The red-haired  witch let her hand linger over the device a few seconds longer,  savoring this once in a lifetime chance. Now it was her turn to prove  her worth…perhaps even gain a promotion as a side bonus!</p>
<p>There was a whirl of a white lab coat as she spun on her chair,  directing herself towards the tool that determined future success or  failure.</p>
<p>“It’s almost done.” She smirked. Her fingers  typed ferociously, anxious to complete the remaining project designs.  “Technology really is the only way to go, besides, who would want  to dirty their own hands? Dum-de-dum…Now!” Her hand came down  onto the final button.</p>
<p><strong>Bleep.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Her face broke  out into another satisfied grin as the screen read ‘project  completed. Initiate?”</p>
<p>Oh no, who would ever dream of it? The  witch thought. “Me, that’s who! And I say, take the problem to  the source!”</p>
<p><strong>Bleep!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Project initiation  confirmed…Waiting…<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Ha ha…hahaha…”A  loud, thunderous churning sound rumbled around the room. The noise  soon gained momentum and left through the underground pipes, anxious  to do its master’s bidding and deliver the ‘goods’.</p>
<p>“Sweet  dreams Sailor Senshi! Ahahahahahaha!”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV, hospital room in Tokyo</u></p>
<p><strong>Beep… Beep… Beep…  Beep…</strong></p>
<p>I listened to the rhythm with a wavering patience  while I sat on a chair by Kaiya’s bed-side.</p>
<p>“It seems she  passed out from blood loss.” The doctor reported absent-mindedly as  he flipped through the charts beside me.</p>
<p>That’s obvious!  What I want to know is…will she be okay?</p>
<p>“Ah… but don’t  worry, we’re expecting a full recovery.” He quickly  finished.</p>
<p>His words reached my ears but my mind somehow  couldn’t process them. Even though it was what I wanted to hear the  most, it almost seemed too good to be true. Kaiya’s shoulder wound,  all bandaged now, was clear as day. Looking at it would make any  normal person shudder; already her blood started to bleed through for  the second time today.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” The doctor commented.  “Looks like they need to be changed. I’ll notify a nurse on my  way out.”</p>
<p>“No need.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I can  do it…”</p>
<p>“But Kaioh san! Regulations state…” He tried  to protest.</p>
<p>“I am well aware of what the regulation’s  state…” I turned to look at him for the first time and he froze  under my gaze. “However, there must be other patients who require  professional aid only your nurses can administer. My ‘sister’s  wound can be easily fixed and I believe I am <em>more</em> than  qualified.”</p>
<p>I watched the man’s shoulders suddenly  slack, signaling the first sign of defeat. “I-I see…Perhaps…You  can find the bandages and gloves in that drawer.” He pointed to the  standing table to my left. “But please take care of yourself as  well Kaioh san. You have lost quite a bit of blood as  well.”</p>
<p>“Arigato.”</p>
<p>The doctor turned to leave but  I did not watch him or more specifically only his shadow from the  corner of one eye. His dark follower slowly diminished until it faded  into the larger shadows quickly swallowed the single stream of light.</p>
<p>I blinked a few times, allowing my eyes to adjust to the low  level of light. And then turned to switch on the small lamp on  Kaiya’s bedside table to begin the task at hand.</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p>A  new warm glow filled the room, especially the small area where I  would be working. As I pulled out the drawer, I found all the  necessary materials where the doctor said they would be. Gauze,  disinfectant and clean bandages…A bottle of tylenol conveniently  stood in the far corner but I left it be; an unconscious person  wouldn’t need pain killers…</p>
<p>In a matter of moments the  bandages were replaced and the old ones were thrown in the garbage  bin. The smell of dried blood lingered for a few minutes afterwards  but I paid it no mind. Part of it was mine. It wasn’t a sailing  solution in Kaiya’s I.V unit… the clear bag was filled with my  own blood.</p>
<p>As I wearily looked up the bright color of red  shone back, quick to remind me of my lack of energy. Yes I was tired  but it didn’t matter; after a bit of rest I’ll be fine. I’ll  always be fine…because it’s expected.</p>
<p><u>Flashback</u></p>
<p><em>“I  need help!” I huffed out of breath as I dragged in my companion  over one shoulder. Blood was spilling from her wound, into the  temporary bandage I had applied only hours earlier.</em></p>
<p><em>The nurse  stationed at the front desk took one look and then hastily dialed  some number into her phone.</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m taking a patient up to  emergency. Prepare a room, we’ll be there in five minutes!”</em></p>
<p><em>The  woman came around to my other side and took hold of Kaiya’s  legs.</em></p>
<p><em>“Wait, isn’t it better to use a stretcher?” I  asked.</em></p>
<p><em>“There aren’t any available right now.” She  grunted.</em></p>
<p><em>An immense feeling of guilt poured over me. I knew  we should’ve her looked at before she left! If only Kaiya hadn’t  insisted she was fine…Ohhhh, but I shouldn’t have listened to her  anyway. I bet the teen thought she was all right because of all that  adrenaline pumping through her blood. Doesn’t she know that the  body in ‘flight or fight mode’ would blind the senses to pain? It  wasn’t until after her wound broke open during the ride back that  we had to high tail it to Tokyo.</em></p>
<p><em>Why does she have to be…so  childish?</em></p>
<p><em>The three of us barged through two double doors  into the emergency faculty where a pair of doctors stood waiting.  Immediately I noticed that it would be difficult distinguishing the  two other than by their difference in height.</em></p>
<p><em>“Room 206 has  been prepared.” The first doctor greeted. “Please lay her down on  the stretcher.”</em></p>
<p><em>Thank Kami…I thanked. My arms were  starting to give out on me.</em></p>
<p><em>The second doctor stepped forward  and checked the teen’s pulse as we placed her on the mobile  instrument. “She needs an immediate blood injection. Miss, do you  know her blood type?” The question fell onto me.</em></p>
<p><em>Blood…type…?</em></p>
<p><em>The smaller doctor who had asked the question shook his head  in frustration and order the present nurse, “Check the patient’s  blood type and quickly!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes sir.”</em></p>
<p><em>Feeling  slightly useless, I followed the small group of people as they rolled  the teen towards the destined room. While jogging, the nurse took  small samples from the girl’s wound and mixed it with a yellowish  liquid in tiny tubes. It was one of the quickest ways to analyze a  person’s blood type if I remember correctly. Each type has specific  markers that determine which types would clot if mixed. And depending  which tube Kaiya’s blood clots will determine which antigens her  blood possesses.</em></p>
<p><em>Well…I may not know what blood type Kaiya  has, but if they need a blood donor…</em></p>
<p><em>“I volunteer!”  Everyone turned to look at me. “My blood type is O negative.”  Anyone in the medical field would know that O negative could be  transferred into any person without rejection complications. In a  short sense, it’s the ‘universal blood type’.</em></p>
<p><em>“Right,  and your relation to the patient?” One of the doctors inquired as  he wrote down the new information into his clip board.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kaioh  Michiru…” Umm…anything would do right now! “Her  sister.”</em></p>
<p><em>When we arrived at the room, they hooked me up to  a machine and that was that. It started as a direct blood transfer  until Kaiya’s condition stabilized. Soon after the machine altered  the pathway into a container.</em></p>
<p><u>End flashback</u></p>
<p>That’s  how we got here…</p>
<p>They didn’t let me come back to see her  until they were sure I was strong enough. To think, I almost missed  Haruka’s race on television.</p>
<p><em><br />
</em>With one  hand I reached out to push aside a few strands of blonde away from  Kaiya’s closed eyes. “Did you hear that? The doctor said you’ll  be all right.” The girl continued to sleep, with no change in her  breathing whatsoever. No sign that she understood my words. But that  was okay, even if she isn’t here right now I’ll wait for her  return. “Haruka also won her race.” The words just came out.  Somehow I felt this was something important. “They all started very  close but she out-did them all by half a lap in the end. It seemed  like everyone loved her…”</p>
<p><strong>Beep… Beep…  Beep...Beep…</strong></p>
<p>I paused for breath. Everyone loved  her…Does that everyone include…me?</p>
<p><strong>Beep. Beep.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Huh?  My own heart gave a quick skip.</p>
<p><strong>Beep… Beep… Beep…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  thought I heard…My hands took one of Kaiya’s and gave it a light  squeeze. Or did I imagine it? She still felt very cold, couldn’t be  anything but barely below normal body temperature. But the color of  her skin! It was starting to show signals of her recuperation. Blood  was making the paleness flush a rosy-pink once more, my blood that  is.</p>
<p>How lucky…</p>
<p>I held back a yawn caught in my  throat and gave my head a little shake. I can’t fall asleep yet;  who knows when Kaiya will wake up? Besides…This was my fault,  everything was and my guilt won’t let me forget it. They’re all  sad because of me. Kaiya, Haruka and Obaa chan, look at them all now.  If I hadn’t lost hold of Obaa chan…</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” I  tried to apologize but the oncoming tears made it extremely difficult  to get the words out. “If I could… I’d trade places with you  right now.” I would take your place in this hospital bed, take away  this hindering weakness and pain. Don’t ask me why…All I know is  that I would if I could.</p>
<p><strong>Beep… Beep. Beep. Beep…</strong></p>
<p>I  continued to watch the teen in silence for as long as I could. Soon  my own weariness overtook me and I allowed my head to rest on the bed  from my seat.</p>
<p>Wake up soon…</p>
<p><u>Morning…</u></p>
<p>“…chi.  Michi, wake up.” Someone was shaking my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Mm…?”  I guess…I fell asleep?</p>
<p>“You were here all night?” The  familiar voice said again in disbelief. “Look, why don’t you take  a break, I’ll watch her for awhile.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know  Haruka…” I took in a deep breath and pushed myself off the bed  with stiff limbs until I was sitting up once more. Must remind myself  to never sleep in <em>that</em> position again.</p>
<p>For a moment I  considered stretching out, it would help quite a bit…But…I could  see Haruka eyeing my behavior with a scrutinizing gaze. There’s no  way that I’d stretch with her watching me! It would be too  embarrassing!</p>
<p>“…Haru-eep!” Suddenly a strong pair of  arms gripped mine.</p>
<p>“Here, let me give you a hand with the  stretching.” The blonde laughed. “You have to outstretch your  arms like so…”</p>
<p>“! Wha, stop that!” I jerked out of her  grip. By now I was sure that I was blushing.</p>
<p>“Looking a bit  flushed there Michi.” She laughed again. Now if I wasn’t the lady  I was…“Well, at least you’re awake now. How do you  feel?”</p>
<p>“Sore.”</p>
<p>“See you do need a break! Like I  said, I’ll watch Kaiya for a bit. Why don’t you take a swim or  something; I’m sure it’ll help you relax.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“No  buts. Look, I’ll call you when she wakes up, sound good?”</p>
<p>“…You  promise?”</p>
<p>“That I’ll tell you?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “And  that you won’t try anything while I’m gone.”</p>
<p>“You  don’t trust me?” Oh here we go with the dramatics again. You  know, if Haruka wasn’t so interested in racing she’d make a  decent actor.</p>
<p>“Never mind…Just… don’t do anything  okay?” I could feel a headache coming on. I applied some pressure  on the bridge of my nose and waited for the blonde’s  response.</p>
<p>Haruka sighed. “Promise…”</p>
<p>“Well, then  I’ll be off.” I made my way to the door but stopped at the handle  to make a quick look back. Haruka had seated herself in my vacated  spot and seemed to be watching Kaiya properly as promised. Maybe this  isn’t such a bad idea after all…I left the room with that thought  in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>As  soon as I heard the signal I turned my head to double-check. Yup,  Michi has officially left the room. I’m glad that I convinced her  to take a break, she really needed it.</p>
<p>“The race went on  longer than I thought it would, but I came here as soon as I could.  As soon as I entered the building I remember marching up the front  desk and demanding to know where you both were.” I chuckled. “  Imagine to my surprise when they told me that Michi had donated some  of her blood for you. Ha, even asleep you’re a pain!”</p>
<p>The  sleeping girl remained silence as I expected. But even a pain needs  people too…</p>
<p>Yeah, Michi lost so much energy in the process;  she’d always be giving trying to hide back a yawn and those sleepy  nods while she watched Kaiya. Although I was outside the door all  this time, I wasn’t sure what to do at that point. Was I supposed  to waltz in and startle her?</p>
<p>“Don’t tell Michiru, but I  was watching you both all night too.”</p>
<p>Come on… Wake  up!</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>Darkness…and water.  Again…A stream of bubbles flew up to the surface overhead. Over and  over I come here, why?</p>
<p>I slowly opened my tired eyes,  indulging in the coolness of relief. It felt good…</p>
<p>It’s…“Quiet.”  The word came out as a blurb of bubbles but I didn’t care. It was  expected to happen.</p>
<p>Is there any real reason for this place,  for this existence? Just look at it, it’s only a void filled with  water and artificial light. You can’t say that the light above is  really real can you? I know I can’t; I haven’t ever broken that  taunting surface. And that’s because…of these blasted chains.  Well, for the few remaining anyway… I wonder why they’re  disappearing, I leave for awhile only to come back and find another  missing- not that I miss it mind you.</p>
<p>What exactly am I  looking for? Why am I here again? I frowned in puzzlement, trying to  recall the recent events. ‘Fire’, the word came to my mind first.  That’s right, there were embers everywhere: on Obaa chan’s house,  in the wind…It made me see red. Kaolinite wasn’t it? Ah! I  remember now, I was stabbed! But my shoulder…I shifted a bit in the  chain’s hold to gain a better view of the injury, only to find a  dark shadow over the inflected area. So I tried moving it. Slowly at  first until I realized that I felt no pain whatsoever from it.</p>
<p>That’s…weird.</p>
<p>Maybe…you can’t  feel pain in this space? But that means when I go back…It’ll  probably return with a vengeance.</p>
<p>I gave out a tiny sigh; too  bad I can’t transform like the other sailor senshi, supposedly your  wounds would heal almost instantly with a quick transformation.  Uranus and Neptune probably have a field day with it. Wait a minute,  weren’t they there too? They’re faces seem so clear to me now in  the battle replay. They <em>were</em> there, I’m sure of it! Uranus  destroyed that youma…and Neptune…I shook my head angrily, it’s  in the past now.</p>
<p>But why were they there? How? We were out in  a different town for crying out loud! Do they spy on people or  something? Or maybe they have some sort of power that allows them to  sense this sort of stuff…? Could it be that they have a special  sensing ability? Now that I think about it, it’s very likely…With  the technology around here they can’t map out energy fields like in  the future. So it has to be a power!</p>
<p><em> “Do you want  it?”</em></p>
<p>What? Suddenly I was on the alert; I thought I was  alone!</p>
<p>“Who’s there!”</p>
<p>The watery liquid shifted  shades of blue in smooth motions, as if taunting my sudden impatience  and lack of understanding. It sounded like…a human voice. But that  can’t be possible! Frantically I searched for its source from my  immobile position. It’s underwater, it’s…it’s inside me.  Could it be Neptune? I tried to recall the voice again. Wait, no,  that can’t be it either; the voice was more towards child-like.  Soft…haunting almost, but with an unusual aggressiveness by being  straight to the point.</p>
<p><em>“So, you do want it.”</em></p>
<p>“What  do you mean?”</p>
<p>Of course I do who wouldn’t? Imagine the  time I would save getting around to battles instead of depending on  random encounters or coincidences. Imagine the lives that could be  saved…</p>
<p>“Why don’t you show yourself? I’m right here,  so stop screwing around!”</p>
<p>A bright, orange light began to  pulse around me, no, it was…the chain. Wh-what’s going on? Is it  reacting to something?</p>
<p>Suddenly the binds clamped down.  “Yaaah!” Geh…Not this again! I tried to loosen the chains  through a renewed struggle. As I did so the irregular pulsing soon  slowed and began interchanging between soft and intense flashes of  light…Then to my surprise,</p>
<p><em>“It’s approaching, so very  soon now...”</em></p>
<p>Wait, what is? Does it mean the deadly  silence Uranus and Neptune were talking about?</p>
<p>“<em>The  decision is drawing near. Can you find it?”</em></p>
<p>“The…Talis-mans?”</p>
<p>Another brief  mocking silence answered. <em>“Of course you’ll find it…” </em>The  voice seemed to answer itself, ignoring my questions. By the sound of  it, if it were a person they’d be smiling. <em>“You have no  choice. But…I wonder, will you ever <strong>use</strong> it?”</em></p>
<p>No  choice, decision, finding something, WHAT IS THIS CRAP! Stop ignoring  me!</p>
<p>A rush of oxygen shot upwards out of my near bursting  lungs.</p>
<p>“Come on…Wake up!”</p>
<p>Haruka?</p>
<p><u>Hospital  room</u></p>
<p>A slightly gentler slight dimmed over my eyelids,  startling me for another rude awakening. I always hate waking up so  abruptly!</p>
<p>“…Ah! Morning sleepy head!”</p>
<p>I  ignored the teasing voice, knowing its owner instantly. Instead, I  focused on the warmth flooding back into me where the cold had been.  Strange…For some reason, I feel…different. It’s not the same  type of warmth I usually feel; it’s like there’s something there  that was missing before. Another…presence?</p>
<p>Through half  lidded eyes I searched the room. No, it was definitely in me, not  this room.</p>
<p>“Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“H-Huh? What is  it?”</p>
<p>“You…really aren’t scared of needles are  you?”</p>
<p>“…Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>The other blonde’s  face lit up with a wide spread grin and then pointed to my wrist.  Everything seem to freeze over for a split second.</p>
<p>“A  NEEDLE!”</p>
<p>My opposite arm shot over to rip the piece of  metal from its hold, but Haruka was much faster!</p>
<p><strong>Whup!</strong></p>
<p>“Nope,  don’t even think about it.” Damn…”It’s going to help you  get better.” For that brief second a strong urge of punching that  idiot surged up.</p>
<p>“…” Instead of putting into words I  growled.</p>
<p><strong>Grrrrrrrr…</strong></p>
<p>“Not a morning person  are ya?” She squeezed on my arm, giving a subtle hint of her  position.</p>
<p>“…” Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!</p>
<p>She  finally released my arm once it had gone limp.</p>
<p>Oh…she’s  going to get it once I’m out of here! As my arm dropped I winced,  noticing the shoulder wound for the first time. So it was still  there…Without that shadow of course and the pain was as I  anticipated- a thorn in the side…er, shoulder. On the bright side,  it was definitely better. Not good enough to go straining it  though.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Haruka spoke up.</p>
<p>“Needle.”  My companion rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Sorry, it ain’t going  anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because I said  so.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t count for anything.” I crossed my  arms the best I could and avoided the blonde’s accusing glare. It’s  always amusing to watch her eyebrows when they twitch like  that.</p>
<p>“Why you little…”</p>
<p>“Hey, by the way,  where’s Michiru?” Come to think of it, I haven’t seen the other  teen since she brought me here. Did she go home or something? Maybe  she got tired from dragging me here, I feel kind of bad for making  her do that. But jeez, you’d never expect someone like her to be  so…physically strong. It almost boggled the mind- she must  seriously work out or something. “Did she go home?”</p>
<p>Haruka’s  eyes suddenly softened after hearing the other girl’s name but only  for a mere moment. “Nah, she went to take a swim.” She did? “I  told her to,” Haruka continued, “she was watching you all night  and really needed a break. Sometimes she can be sooooo stubborn; if I  hadn’t coaxed her into it she’d still be here right now.”</p>
<p>She  was here all night? That’s…</p>
<p>“Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“What  happened to you anyway?”</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong><u>Haruka’s  POV</u></p>
<p>Should I tell her that I was here as well? Hmm…Nah.  It’s not important. But it’s weird; you’d think most people  would mope around after losing family right? Instead I came straight  here. In a strange way I felt like I had to be here, something deep  down wanted to be here and watch over those two. What’s a strange  feeling…</p>
<p>Michiru has been acting strange lately as well;  the air around her seems different somehow. It was almost peaceful  and calm, very similar to her presence after her usual swim. And  these dreams lately aren’t the usual ones of death and destruction.  When did it start to change?</p>
<p>“Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“What  happened to you anyway?”</p>
<p>The other blonde seemed taken  aback by the sudden question. She has to remember, I won’t take  ‘no’ for an answer this time. This time, don’t deny it.</p>
<p>“I  mean, this isn’t the first time we’ve found you all beaten up.”  Even though the first time was because of me, I reminded myself.  Annnnyway… “There’s obviously something going on with you. You  aren’t being bullied or picked on right?”</p>
<p>“I…Well you  see…” She paused again.</p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p>Came the sound  of a door ricocheting off the wall.</p>
<p>“Huh?” The noise  startled me, bringing me abruptly to my feet.</p>
<p>A nurse rushed  into the room, slightly out of breath and red faced. Her eyes made a  quick examination of the I.V unit before she breathed a sigh of  relief. “Good, good…” She muttered, wiping her sweaty brow with  a small hand cloth.</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” I  tried politely asking. Only…it didn’t seem to come out the right  way; I was still recovering from the surprise visit.</p>
<p>And of  course… the nurse ignored me while seemingly absorbed in her own  thoughts.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, but what do you mean by ‘good’?”  Kaiya curiously inquired.</p>
<p>“Ah sorry, no time to talk.” She  said as she turned to leave. Oh sure, now she talks! “It’s on the  news.” And with that comment she was out the door as quickly as she  came.</p>
<p>Kaiya and I exchanged confused expressions. What did  she mean by ‘it’s on the news’? What was ‘it’?</p>
<p>In  mutual agreement I turned on the television and went back to my seat  to watch the screen come to life.</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p>“…By  5:00am this morning, all of Tokyo’s water systems have been shut  down due to contamination.”</p>
<p>The camera angle zoomed in onto  a main water plant in the scenery below. From the looks of the  picture, the reporter was commenting from a helicopter.</p>
<p>“Health  officials have experimented on numerous test samples of the infected  water to find the presence of an unknown microscopic organism. Since  then, ten cases have been reported. Symptoms common in all victims  include fever, hallucination and nausea. Not much more is known other  than the fact that these creatures are currently a threat to  humans…”</p>
<p>The camera zoomed in once more onto a mob of  people outside the particular plant. Many of them were holding  pickets and raising their fists.</p>
<p>“In light of the new  circumstances, government officials have unanimously vouched to  import bottled products under a temporary act that will allow  citizens an equal share of the supplies. Each individual must present  their I.D at any local store to gain access…”</p>
<p>This…sounds  really bad. The idea of it all made me feel sick- think of all the  crowds and being limited to a water source. It would be sheer  torture, especially in this warm weather front! …I wonder how long  will this last? I looked over to Kaiya, who seemed to have a dark  look in her eyes. Maybe she’s scared…?</p>
<p>“Currently there  is no known cure to the disease. To best prevent the infection, avoid  any contact with the contaminated substance…”</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p>“Wow,  what rotten luck huh?” I asked Kaiya. “We come back just in time  to get hit by epidemic.” It really caught me off guard; something  like this happening out of nowhere was really fishy. But they said it  was an unknown ‘organism’, which I’m assuming they meant ‘bug’.  So it had to be natural right? Maybe this is something I couldn’t’  blame the death busters on.</p>
<p>“What’s  wrong? Not feeling well? …Hey, they said that all we have to do is  to avoid the stuff, so everything will be fine.”</p>
<p>“…Where  did you say Michiru was going again?”</p>
<p>“To the poo-“ My  eyes suddenly widened in realization. “But wait, wouldn’t they  have drained them or something?” I tried to reason.</p>
<p>“What  do you think? The news said they only turned off the water supply!  What are the chances that they drained every pool in Tokyo in only  six hours?”</p>
<p>“…I’m going.”</p>
<p>“Wait! Ah…  never mind!” Kaiya shook her head. “I’ll catch up to you  later.”</p>
<p>“Ja!”</p>
<p><u>Pool side, inside the  fitness building</u></p>
<p>Hah…Hah…Hah!…Hah! Hah!</p>
<p>I  threw the changing room door forcefully back as I entered the damp  atmospheric room. “Michiru!”</p>
<p>Frantically I called out her  name and each time, I was met by a silence. Maybe she’s gone home?  That hopeful thought was crushed in a matter of seconds; Michi  wouldn’t just leave if the pool was filled, she did spend hours  swimming at a time after all.</p>
<p>“Michir-“</p>
<p>…Ah…I  finally caught sight of her lying with her face down on the deck in  the far corner. What if…What if she…</p>
<p>“Michi!”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, outside the shrine</u></p>
<p>I can’t believe they kept me in  the hospital for this long! Aww man…Haruka is probably long gone,  there’s no way I’ll be able to catch up to her now. Just  great…And I don’t even know where she lives either. Speaking of  which, I wonder if she found Michiru? Or perhaps the questions should  be… I wonder if Michiru is all right?</p>
<p>I momentarily stopped  my steps to re-check my surroundings; sometimes you can lose yourself  in deep thought. Good thing this wasn’t one of those times.</p>
<p>Right,  all I need to do is go up these steps and I’ll be home.</p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup, tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p>That disease is bothering me for some  reason. There’s this voice at the back of my head that wouldn’t  shut up…It’s like I’ve heard about it somewhere.</p>
<p>As I  reached the top of the steps I routinely called out, “Rei, I’m  home.” To my surprise I received no answer whatsoever; normally I’d  get scolded for coming back late or for not calling… “Anyone  here? It’s Kaiya!” I tried again.</p>
<p>“Oh! So you’re  back!” Yuuchiro popped his head out of the front entrance. “Great  timing, get in here!”</p>
<p>Is there something wrong?</p>
<p>“Here,  take a look.” The man pointed to a closed door. “I don’t know  what to do…” He hung his head in shame.</p>
<p>Automatically I  assumed he was talking about Rei and when I slid the door aside, my  suspicions were confirmed. Unfortunately, it looks like the infection  got to her!</p>
<p>I held my breath as I tentatively I crawled  around the futon the girl slept on, trying my best not to wake her.  Rei was sweating profusely from the fever and her cheeks were  flushed. She needs water! My mind snapped. Immediately I turned to  the cup of clear liquid already set out but stopped short; this was  probably the cause of it.</p>
<p><strong>Swip, crash!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“H-Hey!  What are you doing?” Yuuchiro cried out.</p>
<p>“Where did you  get this water?” I thought they turned off the water system! Unless  this was…</p>
<p>“F-From the well.” He stuttered. “Rei was  meditating harder than usual by the sacred fire and I thought she  needed a drink. But when I tried the taps nothing came out…So I got  it from the well!” The last sentence came out quickly. As soon as  those words left his mouth he took a step back as if he was afraid  that I’d hit him. “Is…there something wrong with it? Did I do  something wrong?”</p>
<p>For a moment I really did feel like  hitting him, what an idiot! But that wouldn’t be right, he really  didn’t know; I doubt this guy ever watches t.v. Besides, I wouldn’t  have known either if I hadn’t been at the hospital.</p>
<p>“Look…”  Oh, how was I going to put it without making him feel extremely  guilty? “There’s no running water anywhere in the city, because  basically, it’s bad stuff right now. BUT!” I continued when he  tried to open his mouth, “So far no one has died from whatever is  making people sick. I’m sure Rei will be just fine…Nod your head  if you understand.”</p>
<p>He nodded quickly.</p>
<p>“Good. In  the meantime, go down to the local supermarket and get supplies of  bottled water for everyone here at the shrine. Bring your citizen I.D  with you.”</p>
<p>“So you’ll…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll stay  here. So get going!”</p>
<p><strong>Thump! Thump! Thump. Thump.  Thump…</strong></p>
<p>I waited until the man left before I let out a  long sigh. This is really bad…Yuuchiro said he got the water from  the well, I thought that would be safe at least. But what it means…is  that this ‘pest’ is in the groundwater system too. It would be a  disaster if it rained!</p>
<p>“Mm…No…”</p>
<p>Rei’s  talking in her sleep?</p>
<p>“It’s not really there! It’s not  going to happen!” Her eyes suddenly sprung open and turned to  towards me. Instead of staring into raging amethyst eyes I found the  opposite; they were dull, hollow almost. “It’s not going to  happen right…?” She gripped the sleeve of my shirt tightly and  quietly begged.</p>
<p>The whisper of her voice shook me, it was  unbecoming of the Rei I knew. It was actually starting to scare me a  bit.</p>
<p>“I…” What should I say? What did she mean by ‘it’…?  “No… it won’t happen.” I assured the dream-dazed girl. She  seemed to relax somewhat but refused stubbornly to release me from  her hold.</p>
<p>I guess I’m stuck here for awhile…</p>
<p>“Go  back to sleep, I’ll be right here okay?” In that brief second her  eyes flickered back to normal before she closed them altogether and  allowed herself to doze once more.</p>
<p>Yuuchiro better hurry with  that water…</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>…Everything  is blurry…Where am I?</p>
<p>“Kaiya? I’m glad I’ve gotten a  hold of you, Michi’s in the hospital.” Haru…ka? “Yes… yeah,  I brought her. What! Rei too?” I heard the blonde pause.</p>
<p>Wait,  so Kaiya is out of the hospital? That thought made me so happy…but  what were they talking about? What happened to Rei? What happened to <em>me</em>? The painful throbbing of my head made me groan softly.  It’s gotten worse…</p>
<p>“Right, I’ll keep you updated. Uh  huh, you too.”</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p>There was a series of  soft footsteps until they stopped by my bedside. In response I tried  to turn my head and greet my friend but couldn’t quite make it. I  feel…so tired.</p>
<p>“Haru…ka?” I tried.</p>
<p>“I’m  right here.” A pair of warm hands folded over my own ice cold ones.  Her warmth was so reassuring…</p>
<p>“What’s…wrong with…me?”  Again the swirl of colors ran rampant again. I couldn’t focus  anymore, so I closed my eyes. It couldn’t have been because of the  blood, my powers healed that problem since this morning.</p>
<p>“Shh…”  Haruka pulled my blankets up and tucked me in again. I heard her take  a deep breath. “It’s…Well, you’re sick.”</p>
<p>Oh  Haruka…The blonde really had a bad habit of beating around the bush  with important matters. Please tell me…What’s wrong with me? I  tried to give her the courage to continue by gently squeezing her  hand. That itself took almost everything I had.</p>
<p>“The  doctor’s said there’s something in the water…and, and you have  it. Also…no one is allowed to be in contact with any water other  than the bottled stuff the city is importing until this thing is  cleared.” I thought I heard her almost choke somewhere in the last  sentence.</p>
<p>Does that mean…I can’t swim?</p>
<p>“But  let’s concentrate on getting you better first…okay?”</p>
<p>I  don’t know…what to think. Instead, I felt a single tear run down  the side of my face.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry…don’t cry…” She  whispered as she wiped away the tear and cradled my limp body,  rocking me slowly.</p>
<p>I soon fell asleep in the warm  embrace.</p>
<p><u>Dreaming…</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>Flaaaaaash…</strong></p>
<p><em>I  stared up at the ceiling, wondering if school would be different  today. Probably not…The silent ticking of the clock reminded me of  the time; school would start in two hours. Should I get up now, or  wait until Nomi comes to get me?</em></p>
<p><em>…No, what difference would  it make? I sighed.</em></p>
<p><em>I pushed aside the bed sheets and slipped  into a pair of foot warmers before strolling over to the dresser. It  wasn’t anything special; it was plain, brown…made from an  assortment of regular wood. How ironic, I found myself thinking  bitterly. When I pulled out the first shelf I eyed the set of  ordinary, cheap clothes compared to the costly school uniform. The  sight almost had me puking. It made me extremely thankful that I  didn’t open the closet door that held all the fancy party dresses  instead.</em></p>
<p><em>I quickly grabbed the uniform and forcefully pushed  the shelf shut…then stared at it for a moment longer. I really have  to stop taking my anger out on others; even inanimate objects don’t  deserve this…</em></p>
<p><em>With that settled I quickly changed with a  bored routine. Skirt, blouse, scarf- all should be perfect. ‘Anything  but that isn’t acceptable’ is what she would say. It made me sad  but I didn’t let it deter me; dad wouldn’t have wanted it.</em></p>
<p><em>Soon  an expected knock came at the door. I had almost finished brushing my  hair.</em></p>
<p><em>“Come in.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Michi? So I didn’t have to  wake you this time?” She gave me a suspicious look before entering  the room and closing the door. “What’s going on?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Huh?  What do you mean?” I put the hairbrush down and strolled out onto  the balcony.</em></p>
<p><em>The sun was just rising…So beautiful I mused.  It was one thing that always brightened my day… to have something  certain in this world. It certainly wasn’t as fragile as human  life…</em></p>
<p><em>“You can’t fool your auntie. I have raised you all  these years after all.” Right now if I turned around I would’ve  seen the middle aged woman crossing her arms with impatience.</em></p>
<p><em>“To  be honest, I don’t know…”</em></p>
<p><em>“It just  feels different, that’s all…But if I figure it out… I’ll tell  you, ‘kay?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Sounds good to me.” When I turned around,  we both shared a hearty laugh. Well, she laughed and I giggled, but  close enough. “Shall we go? The mistress will be  waiting.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hai…”Yes…She’ll be waiting. Somehow,  the prospect always displeased me. “Let’s…”</em></p>
<p><em>We left  the room and purposefully headed down the long corridor until we came  across a set of stairs. My room was on the top floor, so it often  took some time to actually get down to the main room.</em> <em>When I  was younger, I remember being afraid of tripping and falling these  stairs when we first moved into this gigantic place. Nomi used to  have to hold my arm every time we went up or down…Even now I found  them annoying, not because of that pitiful fear or frequent use of  the steps. It was more of the reason why!</em></p>
<p><em>“So, finally woken  up?” I watched a slender figure known as my mother scold me from  the bottom of the main steps. It was amazing that we were related;  we’re nothing alike. Both of her eyes and hair color was a dark  brown. She was also slightly shorter than I was as well. Oh, but it  wasn’t just the physical aspect, oh no… “Well, come  down.”</em></p>
<p><em>Instinctively I refused to budge; I hate her voice,  her words…But most of all…</em></p>
<p><em>When I did not move she made  a displeased sigh and complained, “You know I have a important  meeting. Get down here NOW!”</em></p>
<p><em>Nomi gave me a small push and  I reluctantly crossed the room.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hmm…Tie is properly  done…Good…Skirt and shirt have been ironed…Excellent.” She  muttered to herself. “Oh, and don’t give me that look.” She  suddenly snapped.</em></p>
<p><em>…I pity you.</em></p>
<p><strong>Slam.</strong></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, shrine room</u></p>
<p><u></u>Huh? My eyes snapped open and peered  through the darkness. To my right, Rei was still snoozing away and  outside, it was still evening.</p>
<p>I thought I heard a door  slam…</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, dreaming…</u></p>
<p><em>“Would  you like your usual cereal Michi?”</em></p>
<p><em>“That would be great.”  I smiled.</em></p>
<p><em>Both Nomi and I walked passed the grand piano and  vases in the main lobby until we made it to the kitchen The older  woman parted to the right to grab breakfast while I went to take a  seat at a small table to the left.</em></p>
<p><em>For all those fancy and  expensive crap she buys, you’d think mother would be able to afford  as much in food. Everyday it’s almost the same thing- cereal for  breakfast, sandwiches for lunch and rice with some vegetables for  dinner. That was the norm…But if we had guests over, that was an  entirely different matter. That woman would cater in some exotic  buffet for thousands of dollars!</em></p>
<p><em>“Here you go.” Nomi  placed a bowl in front of me and proceeded to serve the rest of the  breakfast.</em></p>
<p><em>“Arigato…”</em></p>
<p><em>If mother wasn’t so  jealous and competitive of her older sister, this would never have  happened. We wouldn’t have to pretend being so rich; buying the  newest cars, living in this huge house or hosting huge parties for  her business associates every few weeks. It could be simpler…What’s  wrong with living in a normal house and wearing casual clothing? Why  is pretending to be rich and perfect so important? I don’t even  know who I am anymore…</em></p>
<p><em>“Michiru, you should really  eat…We’ll have to leave soon.” Nomi gently tapped my shoulder.  I didn’t realize that I had been poking at the floating flakes all  this time.</em></p>
<p><em>“…Mhmm…” I finally nodded.</em></p>
<p><em><u>Later</u> <u>at school</u></em></p>
<p><em><u></u>“Take care.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yeah…You too.  Thanks for the ride Aunt Nomi.”</em></p>
<p><em>I watched the car until it  disappeared from view before engaging in another thought.</em></p>
<p><em>My  mom is so cheap that she’d rather get my dad’s sister to come and  play ‘maid’ instead of hiring a real one. It wasn’t fair  either…Since dad passed away that woman knew that Nomi had no kids  and pitied her, wanting to help in whatever way she could. And  somehow, she had convinced Nomi that this was the best arrangement  possible. Yeah…great for her; she gets to save a few extra pennies  for those huge parties. It made me…sick!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tap,  tap.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Someone tapped my shoulder and muttered, “You’re  in the way.”</em></p>
<p><em>I spun on the spot, ready to tell whoever it  was off. “What? It’s a free world you …Oh… it’s you  Haruka.”</em></p>
<p><em>The blonde shrugged the half-hearted comment  nonchalantly but continued to watch me. “…?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What is  it?”</em></p>
<p><em>“You’re being cranky. Time of the  month?”</em></p>
<p><em>Wha-wha-whaaat? “Excuse me? Certainly not!” I  still can’t believe this person was actually crying the entire  time; she’s really rude.</em></p>
<p><em>“…” I watched Haruka’s  face as I wondered. Her facial expression wasn’t changing much, but  her eyes seemed to be in deep thought as well…</em></p>
<p><em>What’s she  thinking? Ah! Since when did I care? Probably since she grabbed my  arm and started dragging me away. “W-wait! Isn’t school the other  way?”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s just a class.” She mumbled.</em></p>
<p><em>Just a  class? Oh…if mother finds out, I’m dead!</em></p>
<p><em><u>Beach  pier</u></em></p>
<p><em><u></u>“We really shouldn’t be here.” I tried for the  seventh time.</em></p>
<p><em>“…” The blonde sat on the pier, seeming  content to ignore my warning.</em></p>
<p><em>Ignoring me are we? I checked  down at my watch and sighed; there’s no way we’d make it back to  first class now…</em></p>
<p><em>So, I might as well… “What are you  looking at?” I took a seat beside the blonde.</em></p>
<p><em>“Stuff…”</em></p>
<p><em>That…was  helpful. “You mean to tell me we’re here just to look at the  ocean?” Although, I actually liked the idea a lot… it was very  pretty the way the water would sparkle. And if you thought about it,  you’d wonder what is beneath all those dark shadows up ahead.  People can’t explore it all; it’s too big! That’s what makes it  so mysterious I concluded. The thought made me strangely fulfilled,  like I’ve found something to connect with. I wonder why I never  came here before?</em></p>
<p><em>“…” I saw Haruka turn her head  slightly to look at me.</em></p>
<p><em>“Something wrong?” I asked  her.</em></p>
<p><em>She shook her head and turned back to look at the  water.</em></p>
<p><em>Although we’ve known each other for a few weeks now,  I still couldn’t get her to say much more than that. When she does  make a comment, it usually comes out in some rude way! Somehow  though, I have a feeling it’s her way of getting along with people.  But it could definitely make a person wonder. Like today, I almost  blew up in her face…I really wasn’t in the mood for it. Maybe  that’s what we should work on, her timing.</em></p>
<p><em>The both of us  continued to sit in silence for who knows how long. Time didn’t  seem to matter anymore… So it startled me when Haruka suddenly  stood up.</em></p>
<p><em>“…? Where are you going  now?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Second class. Coming?” Okay, now I was a bit  confused; why would she skip a class but then go to the others?</em></p>
<p><em>“I  guess…Oh, thanks for taking me here.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…No problem…”</em></p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Death Busters  Lab</u></p>
<p><u></u>Eudial was lying back on her chair, watching the  statistics screen with great interest. Her red eyes reflected back  the flashing numbers, meaning anything <em>but</em> good fortune for  Tokyo.</p>
<p>“This is great!” She exclaimed with unnatural  enthusiasm. “If things continue at this pace…hehe, then part two  can be executed sooner than  planned.”</p>
