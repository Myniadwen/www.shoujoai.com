<h1>My One, My Only, My Eternity (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/1only-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>(Behind Galaxia&#39;s barrier.)

A quiet had settled over the ranks of dark creatures, each stopping 
it&#39;s attack on the wall as their dark queen walked before them, pacing 
back and forth beside the golden barrier. &quot;You promised to have the 
barrier down for the attack Galaxia.&quot; Beryl murmured quietly to the 
wavering form shown in the dark orb in her hand, elegantly flicking a 
cascade of long crimson hair over her shoulder. &quot;The kingdom is yours 
once my princess returns to me.&quot; the golden senshi murmured in return, 
obviously in a stronger state of mind now that the attacks had 
stopped. &quot;And Endyimon? He is destroyed? I want him dead Galaxia!!&quot; 
Beryl screeched, causing the ranks behind her to fall back and cringe. 
&quot;It will be done! I will receive great pleasure from killing him. I 
shall lower the wall, but give me an hour. Then you may attack.&quot; Beryl 
nodded slowly, a slow smile crossing her lips as she turned from the 
orb. &quot;Oh, and Beryl? If you do not obey me.I will also take pleasure 
in delivering your head to the Abyss.&quot; The smile faded slowly as Beryl 
looked back to the now dark orb floating gracefully toward her. 
Turning in a swirl of long purple skirts, she looked down on her army. 
&quot;Attack now.Find the Princess.and kill her.&quot; the dark queen ordered, 
watching her dark generals walk past the slowly receding barrier.

island.)

&quot;Galaxia.was that wise?&quot; the retransformed sailor Saturn asked 
quietly, touching her lieges arm with concern, an act so out of 
character for the death senshi that Galaxia simply stared for a 
moment. &quot;No.it most likely was not.but I have no choice, any further 
wounds would make it impossible to fight and transport from here with 
my outer senshi and Serenity.&quot; she whispered back, watching with 
hopeful eyes as the voices of Haruka and Michiru could be heard. 
Sudden raw fear soon replaced the feeling, as the two emerged from the 
mist alone. &quot;Where is Serenity!!&quot; Galaxia demanded harshly, earning a 
slightly scared look from the two, immediately making her regret her 
harsh tone. &quot;She asked to be let alone to say goodbye to her court and 
her family. I&#39;m sorry Lady Galaxia, but she is our princess and we 
could not disobey.&quot; Michiru offered timidly, feeling more confident 
with her decision when her lover placed an arm around her waist. 
Galaxia nodded, turning from the three girls to lean against the tall 
tree that hid them from the moon&#39;s sight, forbidding them from seeing 
the dark clouds gathering around the palace as the first unheard 
explosions silently crept by the four safe senshi.

&quot;FALL BACK!!!&quot; Sailor mars screamed to the other senshi as swarms of 
demons massed at the first set of gates, taking out most of the upper 
guards. The four senshi jumped from the tall gates, running to the 
place where Pluto stood, ready to attack. &quot;Stand with me senshi!&quot; the 
green haired woman called, powering up her long staff. &quot;We&#39;re with you 
Pluto!&quot; Jupiter called, standing ready beside the time guardian, 
powering up a blast of electricity. &quot;When the gate is down ladies! 
Wait till you see them then take &#39;em out!!&quot; Sailor Venus called, 
stepping forward to use her power, being the strongest of the inner 
senshi and leader of the scouts. Flashes of every color were seen as 
the first attacks were thrown at the swarming army, each blast seeming 
to add space for more and more of beryl&#39;s demons. &quot;There&#39;s too many of 
them!&quot; Mercury called, shrouding the planes with mist as she tapped 
away on her computer, &quot;We must fall back or we&#39;ll be destroyed!!&quot; 
&quot;I&#39;ll fight these demons to the end! Are you with me girls?!&quot; Venus 
screamed over the rising noise of the attacks. Three answers were 
heard from the inner court as Venus turned to nod at Pluto, &quot;go 
protect my princess!&quot; Pluto nodded, turning with tears welling in her 
eyes to flee the scene, heading, not to the queen and her daughter, 
but to her position at the gates, leaving the senshi.the kingdom.to 
their own ashes. @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ @}~ 
(Palace grounds.)

&quot;Mother!! Mother where are you?!&quot; Sere screamed, hitting the hard 
marble wall of the main hallway of the palace, as the grounds were 
shook by the force of the fight raging outside. The Senshi had fallen 
back to the inner gates, a bare distance from where Serenity was. 
&quot;SERENITY!!&quot; the queen yelled from the top of the elegant, yet 
crumbling stairway at the other end of the hallway. Serenity stepped 
forward, only to have her attention drawn away as the sound of one of 
her friends screaming in pain had her running in the opposite 
direction, toward the sound. As she broke through the barrier that 
stood at the arched doorway of the palace, a pained sound ripped from 
her throat as she saw her closest friend, Mars, lying on her side, a 
dark saber of energy thrust in her side as the dark blood of her life 
spilled from her wound. &quot;P-princess.&quot; the senshi choked, crimson blood 
gurgling in her throat as she tried to warn her princess away. 
Unheeding of her friend&#39;s plea, the silver haired girl ran forward, 
unaware of the swarming demons that flooded the palace grounds. 
Kneeling beside the raven haired girl, she tenderly picked her 
friend&#39;s head off the ground, cradling it close to her chest as tears 
welled and spilled onto the senshi&#39;s face, making new trails in the 
drying blood. &quot;Don&#39;t leave me Rei.please don&#39;t leave me.&quot; Sere 
whispered, gently brushing a few blood soaked strands of hair from the 
other girls face. Mars smiled up at the younger girl, taking her hand 
in one crimson stained white glove. &quot;I live forever princess, I&#39;ll see 
you someday.I promise.&quot; Sere let out a pained sob as the fingers 
holding her own relaxed, the girl in her arms going limp with the cold 
surge of death. Throwing her head back, the silver haired girl let out 
a piercing scream, throwing all of her pain and anguish into the one 
vocal moment, before standing up, her hand reaching for the small 
crystal on her necklace. Pulling it roughly from the chain, she 
watched in morbid silence as it transformed, not into her usually 
colorful pen, but into a darkly colored black transformation pen. 
Looking around her, she stared at the cleared area, the swarming army 
already having past the outer gardens to invade the palace. Lying in 
the littered mess of blood and corpses, the bright uniforms of the 
senshi were among the fallen. &quot;Venus.&quot; Golden hair lay matted with 
blood, as the beautiful love senshi&#39;s chest had been ripped open, 
almost allowing Sere to see her unbeating heart. &quot;Mercury.&quot; The small 
computer Serenity had given the genius senshi lay smashed, next to the 
girls&#39; broken, torn body. &quot;Jupiter.&quot; The girl seemed to be asleep, the 
only mark on her body being the small hold in the front of her sailor 
fuku, which seemed to prove to be a saber of energy letting her blood 
flow out of her back. &quot;Mars.I&#39;ll avenge you all.&quot; Sere murmured, her 
tone seeming to deaden further with each passing second, the sight of 
her friends dead bodies killing her senses of justice and mortality as 
the pen in her hand darkened further. &quot;Serenity don&#39;t!! Please darling 
don&#39;t!!!&quot; Queen Serenity screamed from behind the barrier that kept 
her safe from harm. &quot;My Queen don&#39;t!&quot; a sudden warning kept the queen 
from moving past the barrier as the arm of Endyimon blocked her path. 
&quot;Endyimon! My daughter! The pen has been corrupted! I&#39;ll loose her if 
she transforms into a senshi!!!&quot; the queen screamed, struggling 
against the young terrain prince&#39;s restraining arm. Serenity stood in 
the center of the blood bath, watching as the second wave of demons 
came forth, led this time by the red-haired demon known as Beryl. 
&quot;Little princess.planning to fight?&quot; Beryl whispered as she landed 
gracefully on the litter of dead bodies, seeming to enjoy the blood 
soaking her deep purple heels. &quot;Moon.Prism.Power!!!&quot; Time seemed to 
stop as Sere stared up at the transformation pen in her hands, waiting 
for her transformation. &quot;Looks like you&#39;ve broken it. Time to die you 
little brat!&quot; Beryl screeched, raising her hand to end the princess&#39; 
feeble life.</pre>
