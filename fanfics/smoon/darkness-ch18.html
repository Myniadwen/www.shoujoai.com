Five years has past since Serena and the gang moved in with Luna and 
Artemis. Life has been good as the thought of the slayers slowly 
slipped from the vampires&#39; minds. Melvin had hooked up with Diana as 
Molly and Ami were doing the same.

Michelle had finally lighten up and let the kids go out to hunt, being 
that it&#39;s their nature. The kids, know teenagers have been training to 
become stronger than ever. Making contest on out doing the other. Life 
seemed to be getting perfect, but that will be changing soon.

***************

Serena walked out of the training room with Rei drenched with sweat. 
She had a white towel wrapped around her shoulders. Serena kept her 
arm around Rei&#39;s waist as they talked happily towards each other. 
Serena had grown taller with her body forming curves in the right 
places.

Well-toned muscles adorned her body wearing a silver sports bra and 
black sweat pants. Her long silver hair stopping mid back was held up 
in a ponytail. Her large silver eyes with specks of blue were lit 
lively as she talked to her girlfriend.

Rei had grown taller as well becoming an inch taller than Serena. 
Rei&#39;s hair too went to mid back with red streaks running through it. 
Her eyes were still a amethyst color as she too gained shape to her 
body as well as muscles hinting her body. She wore a red tank top and 
dark blue sweats.

Both girls walked down the hallway and into the den. Hotaru sat on the 
couch watching TV with Rini lying against her asleep. Hotaru had her 
arms wrapped around Rini&#39;s waist as Rini laid her head against 
Hotaru&#39;s chest.

Hotaru&#39;s hair was still shoulder length as well as her eyes matching 
the color of her sister&#39;s. She wore a black long sleeved shirt and 
dark blue eans. Rini had her long pink hair, which as was a bit longer 
than shoulder length lying out freely. Her large red eyes had also 
darken a bit but were know closed and had a couple of loose hairs 
covering them.

On another couch, Lita sat watching TV as well. Jet laid on his 
stomach with his head resting on Lita&#39;s lap. Lita ran her fingers 
through Jet&#39;s soft spiky hair as her boyfriend slept. Lita had her 
long chocolate colored brown hair in a high ponytail. She wore a dark 
green t-shirt and pajama pants.

Jet lay shirtless and wore a pair of baggy tan khakis.

In the room next to the den you could hear Mina and Tray playing video 
games. Tray too was shirtless and wore only black jeans. He sat in a 
bean bag chair with Mina sitting on his lap. His goldish-blonde hair 
was spiked up.

Mina&#39;s long blonde hair cascaded down her back. She wore a orange 
shirt and black sweat pants. Molly and Amy were on the other side of 
the room playing a game of chess. Amy&#39;s blue hair was still short as 
well as dark blue matching eyes.

Amy wore a dark blue tank top and dark blue jeans. Molly who was 
sitting across from her wore a black t-shirt and light blue jeans. Her 
dark brown hair was up in a bun and her large brown eyes lit up as she 
conversed with Amy.

Serena and Rei walked past the den and walked into the kitchen. Diana 
sat on Melvin&#39;s lap talking to her mother Luna. Artemis scrutinized 
Melvin from across the table making sure he wouldn&#39;t try and pull 
anything on his daughter.

Setsuna sat next to Amara and Michelle sat on the other side of Amara. 
The three woman conversed over a cup of blood. The adults looked 
pretty much the same considering they don&#39;t age that much. Michelle 
looked up from her drink and looked towards Serena and Rei.

&quot;Hey guys&quot; replied Michelle.

&quot;Hi Michelle-mama&quot; replied Serena and Rei in unison. Rei took a seat 
next to Melvin and Diana. Rei pulled Serena into her lap and Serena 
leaned back against Rei.

&quot;Do you two want something to eat?&quot; questioned Michelle while taking 
another sip of blood. She smiled slightly as she saw the two teens nod 
their heads enthusiastically. Michelle stood from her seat to prepare 
the two cups blood.

&quot;So what were you two doing?&quot; questioned Amara.

&quot;We were training in the weight room&quot; replied Serena. She smiled 
thankfully when Michelle set her a cup of blood. Serena guzzled down 
have the cup in one gulp. When she set the cup down everyone in the 
room was staring at her.

&quot;What I&#39;m hungry.&quot; replied Serena as she finished off the cup of 
blood.

&quot;Are you guys going to do anything later?&quot; questioned Setsuna.

&quot;No, we&#39;re staying in tonight.&quot; replied Serena as she stood from her 
seat.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; questioned Michelle. Serena turned around as 
Rei stood from her seat as well.

&quot;I&#39;m going to go and take a nap.&quot; said Serena. Michelle nodded her 
head and watched as the two girls walked out of the kitchen. 
Unbeknownst to the group in the kitchen or the people who were in the 
kitchen, that they were being watched.

**************

Two males stood outside the kitchen window watching the scene being 
displayed before them. One of the males had short blonde hair and 
light blue eyes. He turned towards the man who&#39;s long brown hair was 
in a ponytail and had dark green eyes. The blue eyed man grinned 
evilly as he looked back at the scene and than back towards the other 
man.

&quot;Well Zack, looks like we&#39;ve found what we&#39;ve been looking for.&quot; 
replied the blue eyed man. The man named Zack turned to the blue eyed 
man and smirked slightly.

&quot;Yes we did Andrew. Let&#39;s go tell Darien that we&#39;ve found her.&quot; said 
Zack. The two slayers stood from their hiding spots and ran towards 
the entrance they broke into. Once outside they sat on their black 
motorcycles and took off down the street.

The two men sped down the street until they came up to what looked 
like an abandoned ware house. Zack and Andrew drove their bikes inside 
the building. The got off of their bikes and walked up a couple of 
flights of steps.

Once they met their destination, they came to a door. Andrew raised a 
hand and knocked on the door. After a moment they heard a gruff reply 
of &#39;come in&#39; Andrew and Zack did as the were told and opened up the 
door and walked inside.

When they walked inside the room they saw a man lying on his bed, arms 
behind his head and eyes closed He had dark black hair with several 
brushing against his closed eyelids boyishly. Andrew and Zack quickly 
walked towards the bed until they were standing next to it.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; questioned the man. Andrew and Zack looked towards 
each other and smiled.

&quot;We found her Darien.&quot; replied Zack. Darien opened his eyes to reveal 
midnight blue colored eyes. He looked over towards the two men in 
slight annoyance.

&quot;Stop messing around and tell me why you are in here.&quot; replied Darien 
with a frown. Zack and Andrew&#39;s smile turned into a frown as well.

&quot;We are not lying. We found her.&quot; replied Andrew. Darien sat up from 
the bed with a surprised expression.

&quot;You found her.&quot; remarked Darien as he looked over towards his best 
friends to see if they were lying.

&quot;Yes we did.&quot; replied Zack. Darien stood from his bed with a smile.

&quot;Great. Bring her here.&quot; said Darien. Zack and Andrew frowned again.

&quot;She&#39;s not here.&quot; replied Andrew. Darien lost his smile and looked at 
the two men that stood before them.

&quot;Were is she.&quot; replied Darien. Andrew and Zack looked at each other.

&quot;She&#39;s at her home.&quot; replied Zack. Darien glared at the two slayers 
and began to pace around the room.

&quot;Why isn&#39;t she here?&quot; growled Darien. Andrew and Zack took a step back 
in surprise.

&quot;She surrounded by several vampires. We would not have made it out 
alive.&quot; replied Andrew. Darien stopped his pacing and looked towards 
Andrew and Zack.

&quot;Okay we&#39;ll get her tonight.&quot; replied Darien with a smile. Andrew and 
Zack too returned the smile.</pre>
