<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 5 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Makoto yawned and streched. She was so tired. The battle from last 
night was hell on everyone involved. Except for the attacker, who 
seemed to be having a great time.

Makoto groaned and closed her eyes again, scenes from the battle 
flooding her mind.

The battle had started off bad just as Mercury hit her head and was 
knocked out. From the dust, she and Minako were able to see a person 
walk towards them, his hand out streched and a light blazing from it.

Makoto, in her senshi form, had jumped from her spot on the floor and 
ran over to Mercury, trying to give the unconsious senshi some 
protection. 

As the man walked from out of the smoke, the two senshi saw their new 
enemy. He had flaming red hair, that stood from his head as if it were 
actual fire and his eyes were a cold ruby red. He wore a brownish red 
vest, green pants and boots that went to his calfs. The light in his 
hand was a purplish flame.

&quot;Hello, sailor senshi,&quot; he said calmly, but cruely. &quot;I am here to kill 
you.&quot;

Jupiter and Venus took fighting stances. He smiled at them, just as 
Sailors Moon, Mars, and Yung hu arrived. 

Mars ran ahead of the group and flung a giant fire ball towards the 
man, who smiled and disappeared. Jupiter&#39;s eyes widened as the 
fireball was now aimed at her. She quickly grabbed Mercury and 
everyone ran from the building, seconds before the fire attack hit a 
gas pipe, blowing the school up.

Makoto opened her eyes, remembering how Mercury had looked at her 
after she had woken up. She hadn&#39;t looked at her with hate and disgust 
like she usually did. This time she blushed and looked away. As if she 
knew something she shouldn&#39;t know about Makoto.

Makoto closed her eyes, took a deep breath and released it slowly. She 
thought of getting up, but the body snuggled up behind her made her 
change her mind.

Makoto smiled and turned onto her back, Minako finding her way thru 
her sleep and layed her head on Makoto&#39;s shoulder. Makoto couldn&#39;t 
help but smile more as she wrapped her arms around her angel.

Makoto thought about things while Minako continued to sleep. She 
thought the two of them should explain to the group they were a 
couple, about their past, everything.

She also thought about Minako moving in with her. Makoto&#39;s loft was at 
least ten times larger than Minako&#39;s apartment, so there would be 
plenty of room for the both of them as well as their &#39;pets&#39;. 

Makot smiled and rolled onto her side, Minako moving to bury her face 
at Makoto&#39;s chest. Makoto reachd one hand out and gently brushed 
Minako&#39;s hair behind her ear. Makoto finally seemed calm.

But no matter how calm she was, she couldn&#39;t lay in bed much longer. 
She knew she&#39;d get a headache if she continued to lay down. 

Sighing, Makoto gently pulled away from Minako and walked out of the 
bedroom into the kitchen to begin breakfast.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ami walked out of her house and locked the door behind her. Her mind 
was flooded with images of her vision from the night before. She had 
decided to finally to see and talk with Luna about this. She had to 
know who her lover was in the past.

She walked down the streets to Usagi&#39;s house, still thinking about her 
dream. She blushed when she remembered herself moaning in the image. 
That made her walk faster, tho, and soon she had reached her 
destination.

She knocked on Usagi&#39;s door, and her mother answered the door.

Ami bowed and asked,&quot; Konnchi wa, Tsukino-san. Is Usagi home?&quot;

Mrs. Tsukino smiled at Ami. She was always so proper with her. &quot;Iie, 
Ami-chan. She left a few minutes ago to go to Rei&#39;s temple.&quot;

Ami looked at her, blinked and her eyes widened. &quot;The meeting..I 
FORGOT!&quot; Ami turned quickly and ran as fast as she could to Rei&#39;s 
temple, yelling loudly to thank Usagi&#39;s mother, who stood there with a 
large sweatdrop on her head.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So, everyone is here but Ami,&quot; Rei said. &quot;Thats a first-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;M HERE!&quot; All heads turned to see Ami standing in the doorway of 
Rei&#39;s bedroom, panting and sweating. &quot;I was thinking and I lost track 
of the time.&quot;

Makoto looked at Ami as she sat down at Rei&#39;s desk, her face red from 
running. Her eyes snapped shut as a dark image flooded into her mind. 
One of Ami laying under her, red faced as she was now, calling out her 
name..

&quot;Mako-chan.&quot; Minako&#39;s sweet voice brought Makoto out of her little 
world and she looked at her angel.

&quot;Hai, Mina-chan?&quot;

&quot;I thought you said we had something to tell the girls?&quot;

Makoto blinked and nodded quickly. &quot;Hai, *we* do. You&#39;re not going to 
make me tell them all by myself.&quot;

&quot;Fine fine,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;Just tell us, I&#39;m hungry.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re always hungry.&quot;

&quot;Fuck you, Rei.&quot;

&quot;Suck my left titty and make the right one jealous, Usagi.&quot;

&quot;ME AND MINAKO ARE LOVERS!&quot; Makoto was not in the mood for a fight 
between those two, especially right now.

Usagi, Ami, and Luna all looked at the two in disbelief. 

&quot;What,&quot; Usagi said.

&quot;They&#39;re lovers,&quot; Rei said, deciding to help her friends out. &quot;Minako 
told me a while back, but asked me not to tell anyone.&quot;

Makoto looked at Minako stunned. &quot;It was after you left, Mako-chan,&quot; 
Rei said. Makoto nodded.

Luna looked at the two and as she was about to open her mouth, Makoto 
cut her off.

&quot;Hai, Luna. I know what you&#39;re about to say. Minako and I love one 
another but we know who we know who we must put first; the princess. 
Her safety above all others. Mianko agrees with me on that.&quot; Minako 
nodded in agreement. Luna sat there and remained silent.

Usagi smiled. &quot;Cool! Can we eat now?&quot;

&quot;Iie,&quot; Minako said. &quot;We have something else to say.&quot;

&quot;What,&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;I&#39;ve known Makoto since I was eight years old.&quot;

Everyone in the room except Artemis and Ace blinked and at the same 
time said, &quot;Huh!?&quot;

Makoto sighed and explained her and Minako&#39;s past to the rest of the 
group, Minako staying quiet for the most part. Makoto aslo told them 
about her dying and being brought back to life by usaing the life 
force of the youma that had killed her.

&quot;So thats why you were so insistant about wanting to come back to 
Tokyo,&quot; Rei said, smiling a little. &quot;You saw Minako in that photo I 
sent you and you had to see her again.&quot;

Makoto nodded and blushed a bit. &quot;Pretty much, yeah.&quot;

Usagi had tears in her eyes. Makoto looked at her. &quot;You alright, 
Usagi?&quot;

&quot;That...was...just...so.....BEAUTIFUL!!!!&quot; Tears erupted from her eyes 
as sobs escaped her mouth. Everyone sweatdropped.

&quot;You said a man brought you back to life using the life force of the 
youma that killed you, right?&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai, thats right, Ami. Why?&quot;

&quot;Well, can Usagi heal you?&quot;

&quot;Iie. I&#39;ll tell you the same thing I told Mina-chan. I&#39;m surviving on 
that beast&#39;s life force. Usagi tries to cure me by getting rid of 
that, and she&#39;ll kill me.&quot;

&quot;But that was before we all died and Usagi wished us back to life,&quot; 
Rei said. &quot;Maybe she cured you when she wished you back.&quot;

&quot;I doubt that and I dont want to try it,&quot; Makoto said firmly.

&quot;And the man..?&quot; Luna asked.

Makoto shook her head. &quot;I never saw him after that. I&#39;m not even sure 
if it was a man. I was still very groggy when I woke up and saw him. 
All I saw was his out line and shadow. The way he was dressed reminded 
me of Clef.&quot;

Ami blinked. &quot;Who&#39;s Clef?&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;Master Clef from Rayearth. Its a great 
anime.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, I saw that,&quot; Rei burst in.

&quot;So how did you and Ace get together,&quot; Luna asked, trying to bring 
order back to the meeting.

&quot;I&#39;ve had him since he was a kitten. I was thirteen at the time. He 
didn&#39;t start talking, tho, till after the youma attack.&quot;

All eyes fell onto the blue, tiger striped cat sitting next to 
Artemis. He sighed, knowing he had to explain some things.

&quot;Stop with the looks already, sheesh. I was sent here, from the 
future. Dont look at me like that. And before you ask, no, I can not 
tell you anything about the future. I was sent here to help Makoto 
thru her rough times. She wasn&#39;t meant to die by that youma&#39;s hand but 
when she did, I regained my memory as to why I was with her in the 
past. Kind of like how Luna and Arty were &#39;dorimant&#39;, I was too. I 
know thats very confusing, but it will make sense i fyou think about 
it.&quot;

All eyes blinked as Ace finished his speech.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Rei said. &quot;And I thought Usagi was long winded...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

As the meeting ended, Ami caught up to Usagi and Luna. 

&quot;Luna, I need to speak to you about something,&quot; Ami said.

Luna nodded. &quot;Alright.&quot;

Ami looked at Usagi, blushed and said, &quot;Alone, please.&quot;

Luna nodded, jumped from Usagi&#39;s shoulder to Ami&#39;s and they were off.

&quot;Hey Usagi.&quot; Usagi turned her head and smiled as Makoto and Minako 
walked down the temple stairs, holding hands.

&quot;Hey,&quot; she called back cheerfully. &quot;Whats up?&quot;

&quot;Nothing. Where&#39;d Ami go,&quot; Minako asked.

Usagi shrugged. &quot;Dunno. Ami came up to me and asked to talk to Luna in 
private and the two took off. I&#39;m guessing to Ami&#39;s place.&quot;

Ace and Artemis trotted down the stairs and sat next to their wards. 
&quot;I wonder what she had to talk to Luna about,&quot; Artemis wondered out 
loud.

Ace shrugged and then blinked and stood from his spot. &quot;Ya know, I 
have something to do. I&#39;ll be home tonight, Mako-chan.&quot; And before any 
one could question what he was doing, Ace was gone.

Usagi sighed and turned to go. But Makoto stepped forward and placed a 
hand on the younger girl&#39;s shoulder stopping her.

&quot;You alright, hime-chan?&quot;

Usagi smiled and turned to face Makoto. &quot;Hai. I&#39;m just lonely with out 
my prince. Please, excuse me.&quot; Usagi then turned to walk home alone.

~I didn&#39;t hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
I don&#39;t want to move a thing
It might change my memory
Oh I am what I am
I&#39;ll do what I want
but I can&#39;t hide~

Ami sat dazed on her bed as Luna finished telling her everything she 
wanted to know. So what she saw was an actual memory and not just a 
whacked out dream.

Ami blinked, trying to get over her confused state. &quot;I don&#39;t 
understand, Luna. If we were together then, why isn&#39;t Ma-&quot;

&quot;Destiny is never carved in stone, Ami,&quot; Luna said flatly. &quot;Besides, 
you two weren&#39;t together when the Moon Kingdom finally fell. You know 
that right? Thats why you aren&#39;t together now.&quot;

&quot;Can I change that,&quot; Ami asked, hope evident in her voice.

Luna raised an eyebrow. &quot;You&#39;d really ruin your best friend&#39;s 
happiness to make yourself happy?&quot;

Ami was silent.

Luna sighed as she padded her way to Ami. Gently, Luna rubbed her face 
agaisnt the girl&#39;s arm. &quot;Gomen, Ami-chan. Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t be so 
harsh.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s alright,&quot; Ami said. She took a deep breath and released it 
slowly. &quot;Thank you, Luna.&quot;

~I won&#39;t go
I won&#39;t sleep
I can&#39;t breathe
until you&#39;re resting here with me
I won&#39;t leave
I can&#39;t hide
I cannot be
until your resting here with me~

Usagi sighed as she clutched her pillow tightly. How she missed 
Mamoru. It was pure torture to know her love did not remember her. She 
needed him. And she knew he needed her.

Usagi turned over and looked at her clock. One in the morning. Usagi 
made a face and violently turned her clock away from her. She was 
thankful tomorrow was sunday. Tonight, it seemed, would be another 
sleepless night.

She turned over again when she heart a pawing at her window. She sat 
up, pulled her curtains aside and opnened the window.

&quot;Hey, Luna.&quot;

Luna jumped inside and landed on the bed next to Usagi queitly. 
&quot;Hello. WHy aren&#39;t you asleep?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t sleep, Usagi said, staring out the window and up at the moon.

Luna nodded. The nights in which Usagi didn&#39;t fall asleep became more 
and more frequent.

&quot;Perhaps you should talk to your mother about this?&quot;

Usagi shook her head. &quot;Iie, best not to worry her.&quot;

Luna nodded again. She stared up at her ward and smiled to herself. 
Usagi had grown up so much over the years. Looking back on how she was 
then and comparing to how she is now, it was almost a miracle they 
were the same person.

Usagi sighed and looked down at Luna, lost in her own world. She 
smiled slightly and petted Luna&#39;s head gently. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Luna blinked and looked up at Usagi. &quot;Nani? For what?&quot;

&quot;Just for helping me.&quot;

Luna smiled and jumped up on the window sill and purred against 
Usagi&#39;s chin as she nuzzled her. &quot;I love you, dear princess of mine.&quot;

Usagi smiled and held in her tears. Blinking them back she smiled at 
Luna. &quot;Thank you. Its nice to know.&quot;

Luna jumped down so Usagi could shut the window. When the two were 
under the warm blankets of Usagi&#39;s bed, a small tapping noise was soon 
heard. 

Usagi blinked her eyes open and soon saw it was small pebbles being 
thrown to hit her window. She sat back up, opened her window to look 
out side, her breath catching in her throat.

&quot;Mamo-chan...?&quot;

Sitting on the wall that surrounded the Tsukino household, hidden in 
the shadows, was a small blue house cat, smiling to himself.

&quot;Be happy, Princess,&quot; he thought out loud to himself. &quot;You more than 
deserve it.&quot;

~I don&#39;t want to call my friends
they might wake me from this dream
and I can&#39;t leave this bed
risk forgetting all that&#39;s been

Oh I am what I am
I&#39;ll do what I want
but I can&#39;t hide
I won&#39;t go
I won&#39;t sleep
I can&#39;t breathe
until you&#39;re resting here with me
I won&#39;t leave
I can&#39;t hide
I cannot be
until your resting here with me~ </pre>
