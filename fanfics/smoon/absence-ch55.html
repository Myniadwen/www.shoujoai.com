<h1>Absence (part 55 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch54.html">Back to Part 54</a><pre>&quot;There,&quot; Sailor Moon said with a slight quaver in her voice. She tied 
off the mauve strip of cloth turned bandage that had once been the bow 
on the back of her fuku securely around Sailor Mars&#39; shoulder, 
effectively applying constant pressure against the miko&#39;s arrow wound in 
her upper back and reducing the possibility of it starting to bleed 
again. The princess tied the improvised dressing into a neat big bow on 
the right side of Mars&#39; chest, finishing the treatment of her 
bodyguard&#39;s injury with a faint smile of satisfaction. &quot;All done.&quot;

Sailor Mars watched Sailor Moon&#39;s slender fingers deftly tie the bow and 
then pat the knot gently, before she lifted her head to look at her 
love. The blonde looked back at Mars with misty eyes and sniffled a 
little, the girl&#39;s gaze dropping down to her bloodstained right hand. 
Sailor Mars said nothing as Sailor Moon&#39;s red-gloved hand trembled, her 
princess&#39;s wide blue eyes seeming to be held in a haunted enchantment at 
the sight of the miko&#39;s split blood. Instead, after a brief hesitation, 
Mars tenderly took her true love&#39;s shaking hand in her own two, bringing 
it up and placing it over her heart.

&quot;I&#39;m alright,&quot; Sailor Mars reassured Sailor Moon finally in a subdued 
voice, her steady heartbeat beneath the blonde&#39;s hand hopefully helping 
to put the girl at ease. Her eyes flicked down to the arrow lying in a 
small pool of sanguine fluid on the elevator&#39;s floor, before quickly 
returning to her princess&#39;s upset and apprehensive gaze. &quot;Really.&quot;

Sailor Moon nodded unsurely, not taking her earnest eyes from her 
bodyguard&#39;s. She simply stared silently at Mars for a few moments, 
studying the raven-haired girl&#39;s bloodied features intensely, as if only 
for the first time really looking at her. Mars merely stared back, her 
lavender eyes affixed to her love&#39;s blue ones, indulging her princess, 
the blonde&#39;s intent scrutiny not making the miko uncomfortable in the 
slightest. She was acutely aware of Sailor Moon&#39;s dainty hand held to 
her chest, the warmth radiating from it chasing away the dull throbbing 
pain from the Fire Senshi&#39;s sore body. After what seemed like hours to 
Sailor Mars, the miko losing herself in her love&#39;s blue crystal gaze, 
Sailor Moon reached up with her free hand and gently cupped her 
bodyguard&#39;s scarred cheek.

&quot;Do you remember...&quot; she whispered, tenderly rubbing her thumb over the 
smear of blood marring half of Mars&#39; face, as if in an attempt to clean 
it. &quot;Do you remember the promise you made to me?&quot;

Sailor Mars inclined her head slightly in affirmation. She never forgot 
any of her promises, especially those she had made to the love of her 
immortal life. She had sworn that she wouldn&#39;t die, at least, not before 
Sailor Moon herself did, may the day never come. It was her princess&#39;s 
wish, and so Mars had to obey it. But the Senshi of Fire also had a duty 
to protect Sailor Moon, and that obligation took precedence over the 
preservation of her own life. Sailor Mars suspected that her love knew 
that fact, which was probably why she was always so concerned for her 
welfare. It warmed her heart that her princess cared about her so much, 
but then the girl&#39;s care did extend to all of her senshi. Still, 
regardless of why Sailor Moon cared about her, it pleased Sailor Mars. 
She took what affection she could get from her love, no matter how 
small. Just like the old days really, before she had left Tokyo and 
before all this agonising heartache had occurred.

&quot;Good,&quot; Sailor Moon said quietly in response to Sailor Mars&#39; nod, 
continuing to stroke the raven-haired girl&#39;s torn cheek. &quot;I wish...&quot; she 
started, but then closed her eyes and shook her head slightly. The 
princess then opened her eyes again, returning them to her bodyguard&#39;s 
and smiled softly, the small but warm gesture doing wonders to Mars, 
helping to revitalise her drained body and mind by just its sheer 
splendour. &quot;Just be more careful, Rei,&quot; Sailor Moon said instead, 
imploring the Senshi of Fire with her teary blue eyes. &quot;Please... for 
me.&quot;

Looking into her princess&#39;s heartfelt gaze while the girl caressed her 
cheek softly, it was hard for Sailor Mars to deny her anything. If 
Sailor Moon had asked the Fire Senshi to forever devote the rest of her 
life to her, then she would have gladly agreed in a nanosecond with a 
song in her heart. But perhaps that wasn&#39;t the best example.

&quot;Okay, Usagi,&quot; Sailor Mars said reluctantly in a sigh, forced to say 
something to relieve the worry in her love&#39;s heart and mind, even if she 
didn&#39;t truly mean to follow the words. &quot;I&#39;ll try not to be so reckless, 
if that&#39;s want you want.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Rei,&quot; Sailor Moon said softly, her smile growing slightly.

Sailor Mars just let out a small wordless sound of acknowledgement and 
then swallowed, her eyelids becoming heavy as her princess&#39;s soothing 
touch on her face lulled her thoughts, spiriting them away from reality. 
Mars willing let them go. Now it was just her and Sailor Moon, her true 
love, both taking a brief respite from the conflict around them while 
the blonde comforted her adoring lover with an affectionate caress. 
Sailor Mars&#39; eyes glazed over as her lips began to form into a dreamy 
smile, despite the strange painful twinges coming in her chest. She 
wondered why she hurt so much there, even though her lover covered the 
area with her warm hand.

Suddenly, the loving caresses ceased and Mars felt the hand over her 
heart break free of her grasp, the unwelcome sensations jarring the 
raven-haired girl out of her fantasy world. The Senshi of Fire&#39;s eyes 
quickly popped open, blinking in confusion.

&quot;Come on, Rei,&quot; Sailor Moon said quietly from in front of Mars. &quot;We&#39;ve 
rested long enough; the others need our help.&quot;

Sailor Mars continued to merely blink in bewilderment at her princess, 
before harsh reality came crashing back down to her mind. Hurriedly, she 
turned away from Sailor Moon to the elevator&#39;s control panel, hiding the 
tears that had sprung to her eyes.

&quot;Right,&quot; the miko said, her voice somewhat thick as she hit the button 
to resume the elevator&#39;s ascent. She quickly wiped the collecting 
moisture from her vision with surreptitious care, mentally chastising 
herself for being so weak willed. Already Mars was becoming like 
Setsuna, losing herself in make believe.

&quot;Rei...?&quot; Sailor Moon&#39;s sweet voice said from Sailor Mars&#39; left, laced 
with concern. &quot;Are you okay...? Does your back hurt?&quot;

&quot;No. I&#39;m fine. Just... I&#39;m fine,&quot; Mars assured her princess, keeping her 
face averted from her, seemingly engrossed in the metallic control panel 
of the elevator. &quot;I guess maybe it does hurt a little,&quot; she then said, 
needing some sort of excuse for her behaviour. Sailor Moon was so 
perceptive nowadays.

Before Sailor Moon could question Sailor Mars&#39; words, all of a sudden 
there was a hard jolt as the elevator came to a sharp and unexpected 
stop, causing both surprised occupants to stumble before they regained 
their footing.

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Sailor Moon whined, looking at Sailor Mars accusingly 
as if the girl had intentionally made the elevator halt.

&quot;Nothing, odango atama,&quot; Mars replied somewhat absently, more engrossed 
in warily scanning her eyes along the ceiling of the elevator. She noted 
the floor indicator displayed the number eighteen, telling the Fire 
Senshi that her and her princess&#39;s ride had been cut short somewhere in 
between levels eighteen and nineteen. &quot;I have a bad feeling...&quot; she 
mumbled to herself.

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Sailor Moon despaired, looking at her bodyguard for guidance 
with an anxious expression. &quot;Do you sense youma?&quot;

&quot;In this place, nearly all the time. But our elevator just stopping by 
itself is what&#39;s really worrying me. The youma must know we&#39;ve in here,&quot; 
the Senshi of Fire explained while she continued examining the ceiling, 
her brow creasing in thought as she spied a trapdoor. &quot;We better get out 
of here fast.&quot;

Sailor Moon nodded, and then briskly walked next to Sailor Mars by the 
elevator&#39;s control panel and quickly hit the &#39;open door&#39; button. The 
blonde blinked in puzzlement at the non responsive silver double doors 
in front of her, and then pressed the button several more times in rapid 
succession.

&quot;Rei! It isn&#39;t working!&quot; Sailor Moon wailed in a panic, hitting the 
button frantically a couple more times. &quot;We&#39;re stuck in this tin can!&quot; 
she added in a cry before turning to Sailor Mars for help. Except, the 
Fire Senshi wasn&#39;t beside her anymore.

&quot;Over here, odango atama,&quot; Sailor Mars said with feigned forced patience 
from behind her love near one corner of the elevator. Sailor Moon turned 
around at the sound of Mars&#39; irritated voice and smiled sheepishly as 
the raven-haired girl pointed up at the trapdoor above.

&quot;Oh. Right,&quot; Sailor Moon said, walking up to Sailor Mars and rubbing the 
back of her head.

Sailor Mars smirked at her princess&#39;s endearing antics and then knelt 
down on one knee before the blonde girl, the miko interlocking her 
fingers and positioning her laced hands in a improvised step for her 
love. She looked up at Sailor Moon expectantly.

&quot;Climb up, I&#39;ll give you a boost,&quot; Mars said while the odango atama eyed 
her bodyguard&#39;s kneeling form dubiously.

&quot;But you&#39;re hurt,&quot; Sailor Moon argued with clear apprehension. &quot;Maybe I 
should give *you* a boost.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll endure your plump weight *somehow*,&quot; Sailor Mars said 
in a mock sigh of resignation, shaking her head at the unavoidable 
plight she would have to suffer through.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Sailor Moon cried indignantly, stamping one foot. &quot;I am not 
*plump!*&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Mars said. She then exaggeratingly inspected her princess&#39;a 
lithe figure, pretending to study it closely. &quot;But your fuku does seem 
to be bulging a little at the seams...&quot; the Fire Senshi said in a 
thoughtful tone, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;No it&#39;s not!&quot; Sailor Moon exclaimed, but glanced down at her body 
self-consciously. &quot;I&#39;ll show you! If you can&#39;t support me, then you&#39;re 
just not strong enough!&quot;

Sailor Mars smiled inwardly as her princess determinedly placed one 
booted foot in the stirrup made out of her hands and hoisted herself up 
precariously on the miko&#39;s back, swinging her left leg over the girl&#39;s 
right shoulder. Sailor Mars had doubted that Sailor Moon would have 
possessed the strength to act as a footstool for her no matter how good 
the blonde&#39;s intentions were, so she had deliberately manipulated her 
na&iuml;ve princess into doing what was best. Plus not to mention that it was 
immensely fun to tease Sailor Moon. Sailor Mars didn&#39;t think that she 
would ever tire of playfully tormenting her, no matter what the future 
held for the two of them. The fact that she still could was a load off 
her heart; perhaps that future wasn&#39;t so bleak after all. Perhaps.

The Senshi of Fire grunted in pain as her arrow wound was disturbed; 
Sailor Moon&#39;s energetic movements while she scrambled into a comfortable 
position on her shoulders caused the muscles around the injury to be 
stretched, making stabs of pain shoot into Mars&#39; head. Sailor Mars did 
her utmost to remain as quiet as possible however, hoping to keep her 
princess oblivious to her discomfort. Finally, after several near 
eye-pokes and many hair pulls, Sailor Moon was sitting fairly 
contentedly on Sailor Mars&#39; shoulders, her legs dangling over the Fire 
Senshi&#39;s chest while she held on to the raven-haired girl&#39;s head for 
balance. Sailor Mars reached up and grabbed Sailor Moon&#39;s legs, getting 
a firm grip on the blonde&#39;s thighs before she slowly stood up into a 
semi-crouch, her injured body only minutely trembling due to the effort 
it took.

&quot;Okay. Now open the trapdoor, Usagi,&quot; Sailor Mars instructed Sailor 
Moon. She felt the muscles in her legs burn as she held her 
half-crouching pose and tightened her hold on her princess.

&quot;Gotcha,&quot; Sailor Moon chirped, and then proceeded to push up on the 
trapdoor. After several moments of frustrated grumbles, the blonde 
finally exhaled heavily in annoyance and disappointment. &quot;It&#39;s not 
opening!&quot; she fretfully informed Mars.

&quot;Push harder,&quot; Sailor Mars suggested unhelpfully in a slightly strangled 
voice. Sailor Moon had unconsciously started to squeeze the miko&#39;s head 
between her thighs with every hard push on the trapdoor, almost cutting 
off the girl&#39;s air supply.

&quot;I&#39;m pushing as hard as I can already!&quot; Sailor Moon complained. She 
squirmed on the Fire Senshi&#39;s shoulders for a few seconds and then 
stopped suddenly. &quot;Wait, I have an idea,&quot; she said.

&quot;Hurry...!&quot; Mars squeaked as her princess locked her ankles together, 
applying even more pressure on the Fire Senshi&#39;s trapped head.

&quot;MOON TIARA ACTION!&quot;

Sailor Moon&#39;s spinning tiara flashed into the stubborn trapdoor and 
blasted the entire thing clean off its hinges with a loud boom, sending 
it rocketing into the elevator shaft.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Sailor Moon shouted in triumph, nimbly snatching her tiara out of 
the air as it flew back through the now open trapdoor. She replaced the 
tiara in its rightful spot on her head and then patted Mars on the top 
of her head. &quot;Stand up further,&quot; the odango atama ordered.

Sailor Mars grunted in compliance and willed her tired legs to 
straighten, allowing Sailor Moon to easily reach the trapdoor opening 
and heave herself up off the miko&#39;s shoulders and onto the roof of the 
interrupted elevator. Mars looked up in time to see her princess&#39;s legs 
disappear from sight, and then heard clunking thuds as the girl no doubt 
stood up and walked around on top of the elevator. Sailor Mars took a 
few shuddering breathes, thankful to be able to breath properly again 
despite how delightful it had been to have her love&#39;s bare legs wrapped 
around her head, and then leapt high into the air, latching on to the 
edge of the trapdoor with both hands. She then pulled herself up, the 
arrow wound in her back screaming in pain all the while, before 
collapsing exhaustedly on top of the elevator beside a waiting Sailor 
Moon, cursing herself for not giving her body enough time to recover 
from near suffocation by the odango atama.

&quot;You sound out of breath. Are you okay?&quot; Sailor Moon asked with genuine 
concern as Sailor Mars panted for breath. The Fire Senshi merely gave 
her princess a withering look in reply.

Once Mars&#39; breathing rate had finally subsided to its normal level, she 
stood up and surveyed her new surroundings. The elevator shaft was 
large, large enough for the two elevators of the office skyscraper to 
operate in. Two maintenance ladders ran up the right and left walls of 
the shaft bolted near to the doors to each floor, and every five metres 
or so there was a red caged light bulb that basked the area in a crimson 
haze.

&quot;Nice lighting,&quot; Sailor Mars commented, eliciting a dry look from Sailor 
Moon.

&quot;I guess we have to climb to the next floor,&quot; Sailor Moon said, looking 
up at the ladder that ran next to the double doors above them that 
surely led to level nineteen.

Both girls&#39; ears pricked up when the sound of a motor operating filled 
the shaft, making the pair look around for the source of the noise. In 
her search, Sailor Mars noticed that one of the long steel cables 
running up to the top of the shaft to her left was actually moving. She 
walked carefully to the edge of the elevator she was standing on and 
peered cautiously over the side. The other elevator was ascending. Maybe 
Tuxedo Kamen or some of the other Sailor Senshi had made it to the 
elevator and were taking advantage of its services.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Sailor Moon asked from beside Sailor Mars, also gazing 
over the side of the elevator.

&quot;Just the other elevator,&quot; Mars said, straightening. &quot;We should get 
going, we&#39;ve dallied for too long.&quot;

At the same time Sailor Moon opened her mouth to respond, the second 
elevator came to a halt slightly below them on floor eighteen. There was 
a bang that echoed up and down the long shaft as the trapdoor on the 
newly arrived elevator flew open, smashing hard against roof. To Sailor 
Mars and Sailor Moon&#39;s collective horror, a string of black-garbed youma 
suddenly leapt out of the trapdoor and landed nimbly on top of the 
elevator. A total of four assassins had revealed themselves, all of the 
creatures directing their eyes towards the elevator only a couple of 
feet above and across from their own.

&quot;Looks like we&#39;ve got unexpected company...&quot; Sailor Mars remarked 
grimly. &quot;Look alive, Sailor Moon!&quot; she then yelled. &quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

A fireball hurtled towards the assembled youma, but the dark assassins 
abruptly burst into motion, all taking a step backwards and then 
sprinting forwards, bounding off the roof of the stationary elevator 
with their black cloaks billowing out behind them, and catching on to 
the edge of the two Sailors&#146; elevator. Mars&#39; hot projectile exploded on 
top of the elevator, the blast helping to further boost the assassins&#39; 
jumps.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Sailor Mars muttered as her and Sailor Moon&#39;s elevator lurched 
under the impact of the leaping youma and the Fire Senshi&#39;s attack, 
making the blonde odango atama cry out in fright as she wobbled 
unsteadily on her feet. &quot;Stay away from the edge!&quot; the miko warned her 
princess as the youma began swiftly climbing up to their position.

&quot;Right!&quot; Sailor Moon nodded, flicking her wrist and making her Spiral 
Heart Moon Rod appear in her right hand in a burst of sparkles.

One youma poked its hooded head up to the top of the elevator, only to 
be promptly kicked in the face by Sailor Mars, the force snapping its 
head back sharply-- but unfortunately the creature retained its grip. 
The Fire Senshi quickly brought back her foot to deliver a second kick, 
but just before she connected, the assassin grabbed her leg in an 
iron-like hold, halting the attack prematurely. Sailor Mars cried out 
more in surprise than pain, but stumbled, falling on her backside.

&quot;Rei!&quot;

Sailor Moon was instantly by Sailor Mars&#39; side and bopped the youma on 
the head hard with her Moon Rod, making the creature bark out a bestial 
grunt of pain and let go of her bodyguard&#39;s leg. Sailor Mars flashed her 
princess a smile of gratitude, and then clasped her hands together in 
front of her.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

The youma&#39;s shrieks were ghastly as its face was engulfed in searing 
flames, setting its head and shoulders alight. It instinctively clutched 
at its melting visage with both hands, letting go of the edge of the 
elevator and ending up plummeting down the shaft in a blazing inferno, 
its burning corpse still able to be seen as a spot of bright light when 
it hit the bottom.

Sailor Moon grabbed Sailor Mars arm and helped the raven-haired girl get 
to her feet, before the two senshi whirled around to confront the other 
three youma who had used their wayward attentions to hurriedly climb up 
onto the roof of the elevator. The trio of assassins were dressed like 
most of the others Mars had seen, but it was their weapons that made 
them stand out. Each wielded a sai dagger in each hand, with a third 
stuck in a belt on their waists. The Senshi of Fire narrowed her eyes 
threateningly at the youma; half her face was caked in blood while the 
rest of her was bathed in eerie red light, giving the girl a menacing, 
almost evil, appearance. The youma enemy seemed to hesitate, altering 
their grips on their weapons nervously at the malevolent sight of the 
sinister miko, the three looking unsure of how to proceed. Sailor Mars 
decided to take the choice of how away from them.

&quot;FIRE SOUL BIRD!&quot;

A phoenix streaked towards the centre youma, the firebird&#39;s beak open in 
a baleful screech of impending fiery doom. The other two assassins 
appeared to regain their wits at the sight of the rapidly approaching 
attack, both darting as far away from the burning bird as the roof of 
the elevator would allow. But the targeted youma seemed frozen however, 
standing rigid in place despite the obvious danger. The firebird crashed 
into the petrified creature pitilessly, opening up its beak widely as if 
to swallow it in a maw of intense heat and flames. The youma howled in 
torment, and flailed around wildly, its statue-like state broken by the 
feeling of its body being incinerated. In its violent thrashings of 
blistering pain, the assassin accidentally stepped over the edge of the 
roof and tumbled downwards, its life mercifully ending when its body was 
pulverised at the bottom of the elevator shaft.

Meanwhile the remaining two youma had recovered, and in lightning quick 
moves, both hurled a sai at Sailor Mars and Sailor Moon respectively. 
Sailor Moon let out a desperate wail and reflexively swung out with her 
Spiral Heart Moon Rod, dashing the spinning sai dagger away from her in 
a move made up of luck... and natural skill. Mars dexterously angled her 
body to the back and to the right, allowing the thrown three pronged 
weapon to sail past her-- but the Fire Senshi&#39;s intent lavender eyes 
never strayed from her princess, ready to intervene in a split second if 
the blonde looked like she wouldn&#39;t be able to deal with the attack. 
Sailor Mars smirked at her love&#39;s frantic swing with her Moon Rod, 
watching the struck sai fly off into the air, the miko having been quite 
confident that the girl would have been able to deflect the dagger. 
Sailor Moon herself didn&#39;t know what she was capable of when it really 
counted.

Sailor Mars straightened and then bolted towards the nearest youma, 
while it drew the another sai to replace the one it had thrown, and 
grabbed the thick steel cable attached to the centre of the elevator 
with two hands and swung herself around it, smashing her feet into the 
face of the creature and causing it to stagger back and nearly fall down 
the red-lighted shaft. Mars let go of the cable and lashed out with one 
fist at the distracted assassin&#39;s face, hoping to knock it off the 
elevator and to its death. However, the darkly dressed youma recovered 
its footing quickly and blocked the Fire Senshi&#39;s blow with its arm, and 
then fluidly countered with a stab with a sai dagger at the girl&#39;s 
stomach. Mars batted the thrust away from her with a hand, the sharp 
weapon only tearing a light slash in her right side, and then rammed her 
knee into the enemy&#39;s midsection. The youma grunted at the force of the 
impact and hunched over slightly, allowing the Senshi of Fire to grab 
two handfuls of the its black cloak and then throw it head first into 
the metal mechanism that held the elevator&#39;s cable, a loud crack 
resounding as the assassin&#39;s skull made painful contact.

Sailor Mars took the opportunity to viciously kick her prone and 
temporarily stunned adversary in the ribs while she spared a glance at 
Sailor Moon to see if she was fairing all right. She saw that she was 
currently engaged in combat with the other youma, the girl&#39;s Spiral 
Heart Moon Rod locked in between the prongs of the assassin&#39;s sai 
daggers, both combatants absorbed in a test of strength, one furiously 
trying to stab the long points of its weapons into its assailant, the 
other desperately trying to push her enemy off the elevator and prevent 
being skewered.

As Mars was about to move to help her princess, her own youma opponent 
had already recuperated from its head wound and ferociously slashed 
upwards with both daggers, scoring thin red lines in the front of the 
rapidly recoiling Fire Senshi&#39;s fuku. Sailor Mars cursed her lack of 
awareness; if it weren&#39;t for her sharp reflexes, she would have been 
gutting by the dual strike. The now standing assassin cruelly lunged at 
the caught-off-guard senshi, forcing the girl to madly retreat under an 
unyielding barrage of stabs. Mars blocked feverishly, every nick of a 
sai on her body fuelling a burst of added energy to her fast 
deflections. But still she was being forced back despite her heated 
efforts, until suddenly she stepped back once more... into empty space. 
Sailor Mars panicked, pin-wheeling her arms to retain her balance and 
stop herself from falling to an untimely end. Her assailant laughed 
roughly and jabbed its sai daggers at her vulnerable form, knowing that 
she was finished. Realising that there was no choice, Mars willingly 
darted backwards off the elevator&#39;s roof, letting herself drop. The 
youma lurched forwards clumsily, not expecting the manoeuvre, while the 
Senshi of Fire grabbed the edge of the elevator, her body slamming 
against its side with a thump. She swiftly pulled herself up and then 
seized one of the youma&#39;s overshot arms with one hand, and tugged on it 
as hard as she could. The assassin lost its balance and screamed as it 
careered off the roof of the elevator and past the dangling Mars, down 
to join its dead comrades in a bloody mess at the bottom of the 
eighteen-storey deep shaft.

Sailor Mars breathed a sigh of relief and then hoisted herself up all 
the way back onto the roof of the elevator. She looked up to see Sailor 
Moon kicking her youma opponent in the groin, making it cry out with a 
strange squealing sound and drop its guard for a moment as it bent over 
in torment. Sailor Moon quickly took advantage of the assassin&#39;s 
preoccupation and clubbed it on the side the head with her Moon Rod, 
sending it staggering near the edge of the roof. She then planted a boot 
on the now howling enemy&#39;s behind and pushed forcefully, shoving the 
unfortunate creature off the elevator. Its howls gradually got fainter 
and fainter as it plunged down the shaft until they abruptly cut off 
altogether.

Sailor Mars clambered to her feet and walked to her breathless love, 
giving the girl a speedy look over with her eyes. Sailor Moon had a few 
minor injuries, but she had come out of the scrape fairly well, for 
which the Fire Senshi was very thankful.

&quot;You look sort of banged up, Rei,&quot; Sailor Moon said as she frowned at 
her bodyguard&#39;s slashed and bloody body, noting the many rips in her 
fuku. &quot;Are you going to be alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still breathing,&quot; Mars said glibly, waving off her princess&#39;s 
concerns.

&quot;Good...&quot; Sailor Moon breathed, smiling fondly at the miko, the red 
light illuminating the blonde not detracting the lovely picture of 
beauty in the least. &quot;Just make sure you keep doing that.&quot;

As Sailor Mars was just about to give a witty retort to her love, there 
was a squealing noise of metal on metal directly above the pair. Both 
girls looked up in time to see a figure descending like a rocket down 
the elevator&#39;s steel cable, using some sort of weapon to slow its drop. 
Sailor Mars and Sailor Moon jumped back as the figure landed with a 
powerful and loud slam against the elevator in a crouch, making the 
whole structure sway precariously.

Sailor Mars tensed and stood in front of Sailor Moon, eying the new 
adversary warily. It looked like some sort of mummy. The youma was 
completely wrapped in black bandages from head to toe, several hanging 
off its spindly body in frayed strips. Its legs were too long in 
proportion to its body and were bent in a low squat, giving the assassin 
a frog-like appearance. The only bit of skin Mars could make out in the 
red tinted light of the elevator shaft was around its fevered eyes, but 
the flesh looked coarse, like it was covered entirely in scar tissue. In 
one hand the youma held a short length of wood with a slightly curved 
blade affixed to one end, akin to a small scythe. Attached to the bottom 
was a long length of weighted chain, which the assassin swung around 
lazily with its other hand. The weapon was a kusari-gama, Sailor Mars 
knew, a kama with a chain added to one end.

The youma let out a low hiss and then sped up its spinning of the 
kusari-gama&#39;s chain, before launching the egg-shaped weighted end in the 
direction of Sailor Mars and Sailor Moon. Mars grabbed her princess and 
immediately pushed the girl out of way as she herself follow suit. 
However, the assassin&#39;s opening attack was too fast, and the Fire Senshi 
felt the weight smash into her right shoulder, knocked her away from 
Sailor Moon and backwards, nearly depositing her through the open 
trapdoor of the elevator. Sailor Mars lay still for a second, a bit 
stunned, until the hit made itself known, a dull throbbing pain erupting 
in a delayed reaction at the location of the blow. The Senshi of Fire 
gritted her teeth and clutched her aching shoulder as she stumbled to 
her feet, seething at the youma.

Sailor Mars saw that the wiry assassin was hacking wildly at Sailor Moon 
with the kama part of the kusari-gama, while the blonde was desperately 
fending off the assault somehow with her Moon Rod, the effort it took 
clearly showing on her face. The girl&#39;s expression was scrunched up into 
one of intense concentration... and also immense distress. Sailor Mars 
certainly couldn&#39;t stand for this.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Mars let loose a blazing arrow from her equally blazing bow straight at 
the youma, hoping to destroy the loathsome thing in a single strike, or 
at the very least provide her princess with a reprieve from the 
creature&#39;s relentless onslaught. The assassin looked in Mars&#39; direction 
as the fiery projectile soared towards it, and then agilely back-flipped 
out of its path, its long sinewy legs springing the heavily bandaged 
creature easily into the air.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

Sailor Mars didn&#39;t let up her offensive, firing a fireball at the youma, 
aiming it at the spot the assassin would most likely land. However, the 
youma threw the chain of its weapon high around the elevator&#39;s cable in 
a tight knot, effectively pulling its body away from the resulting hot 
explosion of Mars&#39; attack. The assassin whipped the kusari-gama&#39;s chain 
free of the cable and dropped to the roof of the elevator near Sailor 
Mars. It sliced with its scythe-like blade at the Fire Senshi in a blur, 
slitting a gash across the raven-haired girl&#39;s left thigh before she 
knew what had hit her. Mars hurriedly skirted around the elevator&#39;s 
cable as the youma followed up its attack with more swipes, zealously 
trying to cleave into her. The miko ducked as one erratic blow chopped 
into the steel cable, severing many of the fine wires that it consisted 
of. The elevator creaked forebodingly beneath Sailor Mars&#39;, Sailor 
Moon&#39;s, and the assassin&#39;s feet, and there was a fleeting pinging sound 
as another steel wire snapped. This definitely was not a good thing.

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Sailor Mars called as she evaded a vicious uppercut from the 
blade of the youma&#39;s kusari-gama, the weapon nearly ramming straight 
through her throat. Sailor Mars quickly glanced back to Sailor Moon, and 
saw the girl holding her tiara in one hand, appearing to be searching 
for an opening in the fight to help the miko. &quot;You have to get off of 
this thing!&quot; the Fire Senshi yelled, rolling to her side as the kama of 
the kusari-gama brought up a shower of sparks on the roof of the 
elevator, barely missing her.

&quot;I can&#39;t just leave you!&quot; Sailor Moon shouted, making no effort to move.

&quot;Damn it, Usagi! Do as I say!!&quot; Mars snarled, punctuating her last word 
with a vicious punch to the youma&#39;s wrapped up face, followed by a quick 
leg sweep, sending the creature sprawling. &quot;Now, Usagi! NOW!!&quot;

Sailor Moon hesitated for a fraction of a second more, and then stuck 
her tiara back on her head and dashed towards the edge of the elevator, 
leaping a few feet into the air and landing in an uncontrolled roll on 
the other, lower, elevator&#39;s roof, before crashing into the steel cable 
attached to it, bringing her to a painful halt.

Sailor Mars heart rested easier once she had saw Sailor Moon had landed 
relatively safely on the other elevator, allowing her to focus on the 
fight... and on getting her own fat out of the fryer. There was another 
pinging sound as yet more wires gave way under the weight of the 
elevator, making it creak all the more. And the fierce battle taking 
place on top of it didn&#39;t help its stability either. Sailor Mars had to 
get off of the elevator fast.

Mars exhaled sharply as the heavy weight on the chain of the youma&#39;s 
kusari-gama rammed into her chest, knocking the wind out of her. The 
assassin then dived towards the raven-haired girl, bringing the kama 
down in a smooth stroke at her head. Sailor Mars swiftly grabbed the 
shaft of the kama with one hand, forestalling the creature&#39;s blow, and 
then smashed the palm of the other into its face, cracking its head back 
hard. Sailor Mars heard another ping, and knew she was long overdue to 
get the hell out of there. She kicked the youma in its chest, forcing 
the enemy back even more and making it lose its grip on its kusari-gama, 
leaving the weapon in her hands. She hurriedly gathered up the chain and 
then swung the kama around in circles, gaining momentum. The Fire Senshi 
then launched the kama at the elevator&#39;s cable, wrapping the curved 
blade around the bundled wires above the breakage and locking it 
securely with the kusari-gama&#39;s chain, creating a makeshift noose. 
Sailor Mars then grasped the chain tightly, feeling the elevator lurch 
greatly beneath her. Without warning, there suddenly wasn&#39;t anything 
under Mars&#39; feet but air, the steel cable having finally given up its 
struggle to support the elevator, letting it plummet over 
eighteen-storeys to crash with an enormous boom at the very bottom, 
shaking the shaft. The chain of the kusari-gama was pulled taut as 
Sailor Mars hung on desperately to it, dangling in the air, praying that 
the kama&#39;s hold on the cable would last. She heard Sailor Moon scream as 
the elevator fell, and she looked over to see her princess watching with 
great trepidation at the events unfolding, the girl clutching her heart 
in obvious relief at seeing that Mars did not drop with the elevator.

Sailor Moon&#39;s lowered head then abruptly snapped up, and she pointed 
frantically at something. &quot;Look out, Rei!!&quot; she yelled in warning.

Sailor Mars felt the kusari-gama&#39;s chain rattle below her, and she 
looked down only to see that the mummy youma was slowly but surely 
climbing up the bottom of the chain, hissing vehemently at her. Mars 
cursed under her breath and began wiggling her body back and forth, 
shaking the chain and trying to dislodge the scaling youma without 
actually freeing the chain from the now tattered elevator cable. But the 
assassin was persistent, and retained its grip on the chain. Mars kicked 
like mad as the youma grabbed her leg, its bony fingers wrapping 
revoltingly around her ankle and pulling hard on it, trying to make the 
Fire Senshi lose her grip.

&quot;Rei! The elevator, it&#39;s moving!!&quot; Sailor Moon wailed as the sound of a 
motor filled the shaft. Sailor Mars spared a fleeting look to her left 
as she continued in her attempt to beat off her youma assailant, to see 
that the elevator her princess was on was indeed starting to move 
downwards. Things really couldn&#39;t get any worse.

Sailor Mars swore loudly at her life-threatening predicament, her curse 
bouncing off the walls of the elevator shaft. She felt the youma&#39;s hand 
travel further up her leg, and she violently kicked downwards, 
repeatedly bashing her foot into the creature&#39;s head. Her arms ached 
from hanging on to the chain and her arrow wound stung unbearably; she 
was certain that it was starting to bleed again. Mars&#39; hold on the 
kusari-gama&#39;s chain began to slip, and she clenched her teeth in 
stubborn determination, willing her drained hands and arms to hold on 
longer. She was *not* dying yet, not when her goal was so close. The 
Fire Senshi still had Lazarus&#39; mask to retrieve, and by the gods, she 
intended to get it.

&quot;MOON TIARA ACTION!&quot;

Suddenly, Sailor Mars felt the hand on her leg scrape over her flesh 
painfully and then disappear completely, a shrill cry accompanying its 
disappearance. She looked down to see the youma clawing hysterically at 
the air with one hand as it plunged down the elevator&#39;s shaft, a broken 
length of chain that evidently belonged to the kusari-gama clutched in a 
death-grip in the other. Sailor Mars moved her eyes away from the 
welcome sight to Sailor Moon who was waving at her from the rapidly 
descending elevator, the blonde&#39;s tiara held in her hand.

&quot;Sailor Moon saves the day again!&quot; Sailor Moon called jubilantly, her 
voice becoming barely audible the further the elevator went. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, Rei! I&#39;ll get back to you as soon as I can! But you better not 
fall, okay?!&quot;

&quot;O-Okay!&quot; Sailor Mars yelled back somewhat hoarsely as her princess 
became smaller and smaller in her sight, still a little shell-shocked by 
her ordeal.

Mars didn&#39;t like these turns of events, but perhaps it was for the best. 
The Fire Senshi had to hunt down and fight Lazarus, a surely formidable 
enemy, and she didn&#39;t want to have to worry about Sailor Moon during the 
battle. No one else here in the building knew what ability Lazarus had 
but her, and no one else would be able to defeat him but her. The other 
Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen would just get in the way. For everyone&#39;s 
safety, it was better if Sailor Mars faced Lazarus solo. Sailor Mars 
prayed that Sailor Moon would be okay without her vigilant presence, 
however. She had to beat back the impulse to just abandon her hunt for 
the masked youma and follow her princess instead. What if Setsuna&#39;s 
prophesised &#39;moment&#39; occurred while she was off gallivanting around the 
upper levels after a specific youma? It was a possibility, but Sailor 
Mars couldn&#39;t afford to think about it, or she was certain she would 
definitely forsake her hunt for Lazarus in favour of tracking down 
Sailor Moon. Besides, it was her duty to deal with Lazarus. The assassin 
was obviously a great threat, and if her princess met up with him, she 
would be in substantial danger. It would be better if Sailor Mars 
disposed of him before her love or any of her friends arrived on the 
scene.

Sailor Mars nodded to herself, coming to a decision. She started to 
gently swing the steel elevator cable back and forth while she continued 
to hold on the kusari-gama chain, trying to gain enough momentum to 
reach the maintenance ladder on the shaft wall to the right. After a few 
minutes, the Fire Senshi finally reached the ladder. She grabbed a rung 
and then whipped the chain of the kusari-gama several times, freeing it 
from the cable. Mars would need the kama blade to pry open the doors to 
the next floor.

As Sailor Mars forced the doors to level nineteen open, she had trouble 
controlling the eager, almost fervent, feelings inside of her. Lazarus 
was so close. She just knew it. So very soon the Senshi of Fire would 
get her hands on the mask that had the potential to change her and 
Sailor Moon&#39;s lives forever. Clearly for the better.
