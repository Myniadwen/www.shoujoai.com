Ailan caught the barest whisper of movement out of the corner of her 
eyes, and she spun to face that patch of darkness.  She felt an old 
power wash over her, a power she knew once, long ago, and her clothes 
changed to the white silk dress she wore as Queen Serenity, her long 
silver hair returning to the Royal hairstyle she had refused to wear as 
a human.  The gold crescent moon returned to her forehead, and she was 
surrounded by the faintest silver aura, making her dismal surrounding a 
little easier to detect.  A flash of green indicated that her lover was 
there, just out of reach.
 
&quot;Why did you follow me?&quot;  Ailan flinched from the pain in the voice and 
the age that Setsuna would let no one but her queen hear.  She was tired 
and falling apart.  &quot;I came here to be alone, like I&#39;ve always been 
since you sent me away.&quot;
 
Ailan winched, tears in her eyes.  Setsuna had never been angry at her 
before, even when she told the green-haired beauty that Pluto had to 
leave the Moon forever for their daughter&#39;s sake.  &quot;Setsuna, you know 
why I did what I did.&quot;  Both times.
 
&quot;No I don&#39;t!  I left because I love you more than my own life, I lived 
because you asked me to, but if you loved me you would have let me die 
for you.  All of the other senshi died with the woman they loved!  I was 
denied the right to die for my wife and my daughter.  How could you be 
so cruel?&quot;
 
Ailan shook her head, Setsuna&#39;s pain worse than the shattering she felt 
inside at the end of the Silver Millennium when the ginzuishou took her 
life force to power itself.  She knew that her lover resented having to 
give up the Moon King disguise even though they both agreed that it was 
the only way.  &quot;You don&#39;t understand, Setsu-chan,&quot; Ailan whispered, her 
voice choked with tears.  &quot;When you told me that our daughter would die, 
I realized what a fool I had been.  Haruka was right all along, when she 
told me to teach Serenity how to fight, but I thought I could protect 
her.  Even without you, I thought I could.  But then you told me that it 
was hopeless, and I knew that my beautiful kingdom would fall, despite 
all we did to save it.  When I realized that all of the senshi, the 
queens, the kings, their little children, even the powerless commoners 
would die, I panicked!  I panicked, Setsuna, for the first time in my 
life!  I knew that you would demand to fight, to protect our daughter 
and our kingdom as I would, and I knew that you would die.  I couldn&#39;t 
allow that!  I couldn&#39;t die knowing that even you would not escape.  I 
love you to much to ask you to die with me.  So I sent you away, as I 
always did when I was afraid.&quot;
 
A tall green-haired senshi stepped out of the black mist and wiped the 
tears off Serenity&#39;s cheek.  Those red eyes, always so cold and distant, 
softened in love, and Ailan&#39;s heart jumped.  She had missed that look!  
&quot;We were married for a year, Serenity, and you were very loving in 
public, telling me that you loved me all the time.  But I always had 
this nagging fear that you didn&#39;t love me, you loved him, the man I 
pretended to be.  Then you said that you loved me for the first time you 
told Setsuna that you cared, and I have always wondered if you would 
have said it if we were not about to die.&quot;  She kissed Ailan&#39;s forehead, 
the moon glowing there, and the former queen shivered.  &quot;I was so 
stupid, Serenity.  I should have known that you could never have been 
false.  The others were all right, in their own ways; you sent me away 
because you love me, and I resented you for it for the exact same 
reason.&quot;
 
&quot;I didn&#39;t want you to face the centuries alone without telling you&#151;the 
real you, not the king we invented to fool the kingdom and protect 
Serenity.  I do love you, Setsuna, but it wasn&#39;t right for the queen to 
be more attached to one senshi than the other six.  At least when you 
were the king I could pretend that I wasn&#39;t betraying the others.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you felt that way,&quot; Setsuna whispered.  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, 
beloved.  Our affair cost us more than either of us realized at the 
time.  And, at times, when this place was darkest, knowing that you 
loved me for me made the loneliness just that much more bearable.&quot;  She 
glanced at the Time Staff waiting patiently for her next command, and 
she sighed.  &quot;Would you have come to me, come to find me, in this time, 
in this life?&quot;
 
&quot;In all fairness, Setsu, you weren&#39;t here very long before you died 
using that Time Stop power you&#39;re not supposed to use.  Years ago, when 
I sensed you return to help Uranus and Neptune in their mission, I might 
have.  Maybe I would just have looked at you and loved you, but I 
thought my chance was gone after that.  Imagine my surprise when I felt 
you die for a second time a year later.  You weren&#39;t reborn again, you 
just returned to this plane, and I knew the instant your Star Seed was 
taken.  I mourned you then, my love, but when I turned around in that 
room a few minutes ago, I thought I was hallucinating.  I wouldn&#39;t have 
believed that it was you if I just saw you, but you recognized Shou-chan 
and I knew it had to be you.  I wanted to run, Setsu, as fast and as far 
as I could.  But I love you, and that held me.  I wouldn&#39;t have come, I 
wouldn&#39;t have disrupted your life and reminded you of an unhappy past, 
but destiny, as usual, had different plans for us.&quot;
 
&quot;You knew when I died?  Ailan, that power usually belongs only to the 
Moon royals.  You said you have no power left.&quot;
 
&quot;Only what I was born with, the power that makes me a senshi, but I 
don&#39;t have the power to become a senshi.  Usagi has the ginzuishou, as I 
wished, and I&#39;m just a mortal.&quot;  Ailan pulled out of Setsuna&#39;s arms, 
glancing at her dress and the hairstyle she had abandoned as a teen when 
she regained her true memories.  &quot;I can&#39;t stay, Setsuna.  I&#39;m mortal 
now, and I&#39;ll die in less than a century.  You&#39;ll live forever, or at 
least into my daughter&#39;s reign, and I can&#39;t make you lose me again.  
Serenity need Sailor Pluto, and I would just take you away from her.&quot;
 
&quot;No,&quot; Setsuna whispered.  &quot;You&#39;re mine, and no one and NOTHING is going 
to come between us!  I will not lose you again!  It&#39;s not fair.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s not fair for you to fall in love with me all over again because 
I&#39;ll grow old and die and you&#39;ll be even more alone than you are now,&quot; 
Ailan sobbed, fists clenched at her sides.  &quot;You deserve better than 
that.&quot;
 
&quot;I loved a queen,&quot; she whispered, pulling the slender woman back into 
her arms.  &quot;Maybe Usagi can use the ginzuishou to make you live a long 
time, too, since you still have some power.&quot;  At Ailan&#39;s muffled 
refusal, Setsuna kissed her bowed head and let her love wash over the 
younger woman.  &quot;Or maybe you could stay just for a little while?  You 
could stay to make sure the six senshi princesses find happiness.  That 
won&#39;t take until Crystal Tokyo, I assure you.  Maybe you can stay long 
enough to see Usagi marry Mamoru-kun.&quot;
 
Setsuna&#39;s gentle persuasion calmed Ailan, and she sighed as she looked 
up.  &quot;How do you do that, my love?  Fine, but I&#39;ll only stay for a 
little while.  Only a few months, at most.  Then we&#39;ll both return to 
our lives and we won&#39;t try to contact each other ever again.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay.&quot;
 
&quot;Where did you learn that, anyway?  Calming people was never your 
specialty.&quot;
 
&quot;Kazeko&#39;s grandson taught me.&quot;
 
&quot;What?  Haruka and Michiru had a child?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah.  When they combined their powers the night all of the senshi 
absorbed their stones, they apparently conceived a child in Michiru&#39;s 
womb.  They didn&#39;t know until he healed Michiru in the final battle.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka told Michiru to run, didn&#39;t she?&quot;
 
Setsuna paused, nodding.  &quot;Yeah, she did.  I never thought about that 
before.  I guess if I needed to know that you loved me, I should have 
looked more closely at those two.  Michiru summoned me with the Space 
Sword and had me take the boy so she could die beside her lover.  I 
carried him, birthed him, and raised him to be the protector of Earth, 
guardian of the Golden Crystal, and when he was old enough I took him 
back in time and installed Helios in Elysion.  He&#39;s the only reason 
Earth survived for our daughter; if the Golden Crystal was left 
defenseless, Earth would have fallen long ago.&quot;
 
&quot;So it&#39;s a good thing you lived or no one would have been reborn.  
Destiny had a duty for you in the form of Michiru&#39;s child.&quot;
 
&quot;She wouldn&#39;t become her mother,&quot; Setsuna whispered.  &quot;I just became 
you.  Thank you, for making me run.&quot;  The two women embraced, the bond 
they had forged centuries ago beginning to return.  When they pulled 
apart, the Garnet Orb glowed, reminding Setsuna that the Time Portal was 
not a refuge for lovers.  &quot;We should return to the girls; they&#39;re 
probably worried sick.  I think we should return just in time for the 
wedding.&quot;  She waved her hand, and her sailor fuku vanished, leaving the 
form-fitting tuxedo Ailan&#39;s assistants had finished before the two 
queens retreated to the Time Portal.
 
Ailan looked at her queen dress and willed it to fade into the shirt and 
skirt she had worn to work on Michiru&#39;s wedding gown.  &quot;I&#39;m not dressed 
for a wedding, love.&quot;
 
&quot;Easily remedied.&quot;  Setsuna touched her orb and waved her free hand.  
&quot;That&#39;s nice.&quot;  She waved her hand through the mist, and a mirror 
formed.  &quot;Look.&quot;
 
Ailan gasped at her full-length reflection.  Her plain working dress had 
changed into an elegant, shimmering silver silk gown with tiny golden 
crescent moon designs decorating the skirt, and her shoes had become 
sandal-like silver high-heels, sparkling with tiny diamonds.  Her long 
hair was curled on top of her head, hanging down only to her waist, one 
silver curl caressing her cheek.  Chains of diamonds sparkled from the 
depths of her locks, twinkling even in the dim light of Setsuna&#39;s 
domain.  Tears sparkled on her cheeks.
 
&quot;I&#39;ve had a few centuries to learn some tricks.  What do you think?&quot;
 
&quot;I love it.  Thank you.&quot;
 
&quot;Anything for my beloved queen.&quot;  Setsuna held out her arm, which Ailan 
took, and touched her staff, commanding it to form a portal back to the 
mundane world.  They stepped through the space/time disturbance, the 
Time Staff vanishing, and entered a room filled with excited, nervous 
senshi.</pre>
