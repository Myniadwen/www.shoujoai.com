<h1>Eternity (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saun.html">Saun</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A young woman made her way through the park. A
particularly strong breeze blew the silken curtain
of her hair and she reached a delicate hand up and
smoothed a few tendrils from her face. Michiru had
finished a hour and a half early and was making her
way to the place where her blonde partner would know
to find her.

&quot;Michiru-san!&quot;

The elegant woman tucked an errant curl behind her ear.
A smile stole over her perfect features.

&quot;Usagi-chan,&quot;she acknowledged.

The blonde haired girl skidded to a halt. &quot;Is Haruka-san
with you?&quot;

&quot;No, Haruka won&#146;t be here to pick me up for a while
yet.&quot;The elegant woman smiled warmly. &quot;Would you like
to keep me company until she arrives?&quot;

Usagi nodded eagerly.

&quot;Let&#39;s find a place to sit, ne?&quot;

&quot;Hai!&quot;

A short time later Usagi lay staring up at the
blue sky with her head in Michiru&#146;s lap.

&quot;Michiru-san?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot;the elegant violinist was gently undoing the
trademark buns.

&quot;Do you ever think about the future?&quot;

&quot;Of course. It is my duty to be concerned about the future,&quot;
Michiru offered up the pat reply. She absently ran fingers
through her Princess&#146; bangs.

&quot;I don&#146;t mean that future.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;I mean a future with Haruka-san.&quot;

&quot;If I were allowed to dream of such things.&quot; She sighed softly.
&quot;I would want to live in a house by the seashore with Haruka.&quot;

&quot;Would you have children?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s not possible Usagi-chan.&quot;Michiru lightly touched the Princess&#146;
nose, ignoring the soft pang of yearning in her heart.

&quot;But if you could?&quot;the blonde persisted.

&quot;If we could, then yes, I would love to have children with Haruka,
but we do have Hotaru and that is more than we had ever hoped for.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; Usagi&#145;s thoughts drifted to her future daughter and her best
friend. &quot;Michiru-san?&quot;

&quot;Hai, koneko -chan?&quot;Michiru answered tenderly, borrowing Haruka&#146;s
nickname for the girl.

Usagi looked up at her. &quot;What would your house look like?&quot;

Michiru sighed internally but decided to indulge the girl&#146;s curiosity.
She took out a pencil and pad and lightly sketched her dream home.
It wasn&#146;t large, but it was two stories.

Usagi sat up to watch the artist&#39;s vision take shape. Michiru put her
heart into the drawing, under her skilled pencil tiny details
sprang to life.

&quot;Suuugoi,&quot; Usagi whispered reverently. Wide blue eyes drank in
everything.  &quot;What are those?&quot;

&quot;Sea gulls,&quot;the aqua haired woman informed her princess. &quot;I
don&#146;t think I could stand to live very far from the ocean.&quot;

&quot;Mh.&quot;Usagi nodded quickly, her expression joyful.

After a few more minutes, she stopped, satisfied with the
sketch.

&quot;It&#146;s beautiful, Michiru-san.&quot;

The artist smiled. She glanced over at the image with longing,
wishing again for its seemingly impossible happy future before
setting aside her sketchpad. She gestured for Usagi to lie back
down and returned to braiding the younger woman&#146;s hair.

The warm sunlight combined with the gentle movement of Michiru&#39;s
hands brought a powerful urge to sleep. Having no need to fight
it, Usagi was soon lightly dozing on the edge of the artist&#146;s
skirt.

A flurry of petals cascaded down tickling her face and Usagi wriggled
slightly, before opening her eyes.

&quot;Haruka-san!&quot;She smiled brightly at the sandy blonde who stood
over them.

Usagi&#146;s impossibly long hair was now woven around her head like a
crown. She looked very much like the Princess she was.

Michiru looked up at Haruka lovingly.

&quot;Our princess is growing up.&quot;

&quot;So I see.&quot;Haruka&#146;s teal eyes were wide.

&quot;Usako?&quot;an unsure voice asked.

Haruka turned to see Mamoru behind her.

&quot;Mamo-chan!&quot;The princess flung herself into her fianc&eacute;e&#146;s arms. With
a few waves they were on their way.

Haruka offered a hand and helped Michiru to her feet. The
violinist brushed out her skirt. Haruka retrieved her case.

&quot;So you spent the afternoon with Odango?&quot;

Michiru gave a rueful chuckle. &quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;What did you talk about?&quot;Haruka was curious.

&quot;Silly things.&quot;Michiru said dismissively.

Haruka nodded. &quot;After everything... she can still be so
childlike sometimes.&quot;Her low voice held a note of wonder.

&quot;Hai.&quot;Michiru whispered with a nod before she switched gears into
Michiru-mama. It was all right to indulge in dreams with Usagi for
a little while, but in the present she had responsibilities. Hard
responsibilities sometime, but she also had her family so she was
content. &quot;We&#146;d better pick up something for dinner before Hotaru
gets home. She needs to eat more than just packs of rice candy.&quot;
After all, even Setsuna didn&#39;t know the exact future, only
possibilities. It was their duty to work toward bringing the
best of those to fruition, whatever the cost.
