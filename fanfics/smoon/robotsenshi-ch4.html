<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The mushy, gushy, fuzzt wuzzy romance Omake</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Static fizzes until  the screen clears to show us that Rei and</em> <em>Usagi</em> <em>are  relaxing at the park…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi inhaled the sweet  smell of autumn, feeling the crisp chill sting her cheeks lightly.  Rei sat next to her reading a book with one hand while her left arm  had draped itself behind Usagi, though neither girl noticed this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi smiled and leaned  back, shivering when a gust of wind cut through her layers of  clothing. Subconsciously, she snuggled closer to the miko, laying her  head on Rei's shoulder. She felt Rei tense, then relax again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi breathed deeply  again, only to smell Rei's gentle scent, a mixture of spices and  incense.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smelled like fire,  Usagi decided snuggling even closer to her guardian. She rested her  nose at the junction of Rei's neck, delighting in the shiver she  invoked from the normally upbeat shrine maiden. Usagi wrapped her  arms around Rei's waist, her heart soaring when Rei tightened her  left arm around Usagi's shoulders. She grinned against Rei's neck  when she felt the miko rest her own head atop the blonde's.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You smell nice.”  Usagi murmured. She heard Rei grunt in reply, the book in her hand  completely forgotten in favor of holding the moon princess tighter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I was right at the  part where Voldemort had Harry cornered…</em>Rei thought lazily. <em>Oh  well. I guess I'll never know if Harry survives.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was then that the  two girls noticed the romantic violin music that had been playing  since the omake had started.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the—?” Rei  started, turning to look over her shoulder at the grove of trees.  They heard the violin strike a sour note, before a <strong><em>very</em></strong> familiar voice shouted,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh shit! They're on  to us! RUN MICHI-KOI!!” Haruka shouted, jumping out of the bushes  and running for her life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait Ruka-no-baka!”  Michiru screamed, infuriated that her wife had completely abandoned  her. “You'll be keeping Mr. Couch warm all through next year!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi growled, then  turned to the poorly concealed authoress and her associate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh-oh.”  Tempestflame muttered. “Retasu-chan?” she said to her fellow  Usa/Rei shipper, LunarMiasma. “I <strong><em>think</em></strong> we may be  breaking the fourth wall here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”  LunarMiasma murmured, holding her camera (which had taken several  photos of Usagi an Rei to sell on the internet) , “I hadn't  noticed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When Usagi cracked her  knuckles threateningly, Tempestflame panicked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh shit! They're on  to us! RUN RETASU-CHAN!!” And with that, the two  artists/authoresses disappeared into a puff of multicolored smoke.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei sighed and buried  her face in her hands. “She just couldn't resist the self-insertion  huh?” she asked dryly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And she couldn't  resist the potentials for comedy.” Usagi moaned, sad that her  fluffy moment pf romance was ruined by the authoress.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Static fizzes, then  the screen goes blank.</em></span></p>
