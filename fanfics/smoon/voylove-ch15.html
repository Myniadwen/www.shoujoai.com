<p>Stone of Lust that Fuses Love and Passion</p>
<p><strong>Usagi's POV:</strong></p>
<p>She's mad at me. I can tell. What did I do now?</p>
<p>I  watch her trample leaves underfoot, and soon, I realize she repeatedly  looking on both her sides. She's looking for something. I rush up and  fall into step beside her. Making sure I have her attention, I ask,  “Rei-chan, what's wrong?”</p>
<p>She looks the other way. “What makes you think there's something wrong?”</p>
<p>I point out, “You're avoiding me.”</p>
<p>“I'm still answering you, aren't I?” She still has that agitated look. And then I get a <em>new</em> revelation. She's nervous about seeing someone, excited, happy, kind of nervous. Could it be...?</p>
<p>“Hey, is Mina-chan nearby?”</p>
<p>My  sudden question must have startled her, because she stares at me for a  moment before vigorously shaking her head and stepping up the pace.</p>
<p>As  I see her walk farther away, I sense something inside me telling me to  go for it while I still can, before they're reunited. As we reach the  hill, my mind is made up.</p>
<p>She pauses to make sure I'm still  behind her, and then starts climbing the hill. I look up, and I find  it's rather steep. Shaking it off, I start climbing, following the path  Rei is setting.</p>
<p>Halfway up, the rock I use as a hand leverage  slips, and I yelp as I nearly go sliding all the way down. It's enough  warning for Rei, though, and she snatches my hand from mid air. Once  I've calmed down, she asks if I'm all right, and I manage a nod. She  waits until I start climbing again before doing the same.</p>
<p>That's  when I notice. Right now, Rei is wearing a blouse and tight leggings,  and it shows her curves really well. Actually, from my view behind  her... Ack! What am I doing? These aren't the thoughts of a Princess!  Concentrate on climbing, baka! Every so often, I find my gaze traveling  to places where it shouldn't, and I have to berate myself to stop  looking. It doesn't really last.</p>
<p>We reach the top landing fairly  easily- it just took a while. Rei helps me up the last part, and I find  that the hill is so steep, there's only a gazebo to take up the whole  top. Oh well. At least it's flat. And it has some benches to sit down  on.</p>
<p>Rei apparently appreciates this, too, and by unspoken  consensus we both sit down. I watch as she absently grips the thin  column for support as she looks behind the bench to the horizon. I  look, too, in case she catches me staring. Oh what the hey- we're both  sitting, there's no entertainment- why not? I rest my head on my folded  arms on the back of the bench, and turn my head so I can watch her  undisturbed.</p>
<p>Rei's so beautiful... I wish I could be like her.  Everyone knows that if she were into guys, if she cared to go to  parties, she'd be the queen of every ball. It doesn't matter that I'm  the Princess of the Kingdom, or that Mom is the Queen- she'd be crowned  as soon as someone could get her to accept it. And it's not just looks  either. Rei-chan is so calm, and rational, and she understands the  people who throws tantrums, and she can humble them all with her own  fits... She's loyal... fiercely loyal... and protective... and  trustworthy... and... and...</p>
<p>Kami-sama, I want her so much.</p>
<p>She  finally takes notice of my staring, and turns to me. From the look in  those lavender orbs of hers, she's known I've been watching her for a  while now, and is unsurprised. Nevertheless, she asks, “Is something  wrong?”</p>
<p><em>Yes- my whole life is incomplete because I can't have you.</em> And I don't mean as a companion, as a friend, as a confidante. <em>I can't have </em>you</p>
<p>Instead  of saying that, though, I shrug. But it's as if she can read my mind,  and she turns towards the horizon again. “I wonder how Mamoru-san is  doing...”</p>
<p>A haziness begins to fog my brain, and before I can  assure her that he's fine, I begin to wonder who this Mamoru is...  there's only Rei here... “Rei's the only one that matters to me...”</p>
<p>Her  head snaps up and she stares at me. A part of me recoils, wondering how  in the world that had gotten out. But figuring I might as well  continue, I add, “Thank you, Rei-chan. I don't say it enough- you're  always looking out for me.”</p>
<p>Her eyes soften and a light smile  graces her features. Oh that smile... those lips... how I yearn to kiss  them! Again, it's as if she can read my mind, her smile fades and she  gives me a strange look. “U- usagi-chan? Are you feeling all right?”</p>
<p>She  reaches out, from the angle, most likely to feel my forehead, but I  latch out, holding her delicate wrist, purring as I nuzzle that hand.  Her skin is so silky smooth, so perfect...</p>
<p>I can sense in her  voice as she repeats my name, that she's really growing concerned. I  murmur a few words in hopes of reassuring her. “I'm fine... I'll be  blissfully happy as long as I'm with you, Rei-chan. With you... all  alone... my Rei-chan...”</p>
<p>Abruptly, I find that the hand I held is  gone- she's stolen it back. I open my eyes to look at her, and she's  standing before me. The multiple hand signs she makes are hypnotic, and  I find my eyes growing leaden. Then I see that strip of paper again,  and I remember when we first met.</p>
<p>I smile languidly. “I'm not a youma, Rei-chan...”</p>
<p>She releases it, after which she declares, “Maybe not, but <em>something's </em>influencing you. Wake up, Usagi!”</p>
<p>Usagi...  Bunny... no, don't call me that. Bunny's for everyone else. I snatch  the paper out of the air like an unearthly feline. Slowly, I make my  way to a standing position, and attempt reaching out for her. She takes  a step back for every one I stagger forward. “Rei-chan... call me...” A  small voice inside my head tells me there's something wrong, that I'm  not being myself, that the Rei-chan I know never looks at me with that  much fear in her eyes, that much contempt.</p>
<p>Then again, the Rei I knew also wasn't my lover. <em>Something</em> obviously needed to change.</p>
<p>I  advance closer, she keeps backing up, until she hits a post at the  other end of the gazebo. “Usagi... come to your senses and wake up!  You... you aren't acting like you usually do. You-”</p>
<p>The last of  my refusal snaps, and I sprint the last of the distance, taking her up  in a hug, even as she struggles. “I love you, Rei!” Suddenly, all her  movements stop, though I can hear her soft, rushed breathing, and feel  the fall and rise of her chest. Confidence strengthening, I continue,  knowing she's listening.</p>
<p>“No one complements me better than you.  You're everything I'm not and more. You're beautiful, graceful, smart,  strong, loyal, trustworthy... I love you Rei! I want to be with you. I  don't want anyone else but you. And I don't care what anyone else says- <em>I want you.</em>” Finding that my mouth's run dry of words to spout,  I slowly back up so I can see her expression. Her head is hung, and  there's a strange smile on her face. It isn't one of rejection... or  acceptance... more like... that small voice inside me revives just a  little. I see sympathetic irony in that smile.</p>
<p>After a long  silence, in which I allow her to gather her thoughts, she speaks. It's  a quiet whisper, but I can hear it all. And I'm not liking it at all.</p>
<p>“There  was a time, maybe a week ago now, that Mina asked me a simple question.  'Why do you want me to wait?' I told her there were some things I  needed to search out, to let go, to fully satisfy my curiosity before  anything else. She understood, and let it be. Then I had to figure out  exactly what it was that was bothering me so much.</p>
<p>“It wasn't  you, Usagi. It never had anything to do with you. Or Mamoru for that  matter. I knew since before I even knew what love was, that you two  belonged together. And I never felt that spark that was needed to start  any romantic feelings, for us anyway.</p>
<p>“But I felt it with Mina,  instantly. I thought it was just because of who she was, the Senshi of  Love. I befriended her all the same, and slowly, I began to realize it  wasn't just that. I got scared, and ran. The first thing I bumped into  was Mamoru. I was young and naïve then; I tried using him as a shield,  to hide my growing feelings for my leader, my best friend, my fellow  female Senshi.</p>
<p>“It didn't work. He was getting too attached to  you to be an effective obstacle. Then I saw you, and the power you had  with the Silver Millennium Crystal. I thought if you could wield that  much power for love and justice, you would be a suitable hindrance  between me and Mina. It worked longer, but then you clung and wouldn't  let go. My plan was backfiring. If I couldn't make you let me go,  Mamoru might leave, <em>Mina</em> might give up. The latter, I realized,  scared me more than everything else combined. I didn't care what  society told me was wrong anymore. I needed Mina, and in being her best  friend, I already knew I would be safe in refuge with her.</p>
<p>“I  tried to get close to her, I tried to show her how I felt, without  having to say it. She didn't show any signs of knowing, or  reciprocating. She flirted at all the balls (and parties), with all her  suitors. I began to think it was too late.</p>
<p>“But then, on the  short voyage that I was never supposed to go on, at least, I hadn't  planned to two weeks beforehand, she triggered something. Just by  asking what I wanted for my birthday, she figured it out, and she told  me she felt the same. If I hadn't been suspicious of her motives, I  would have died with the happiness she gave me then.</p>
<p>“I'm getting  off track. What you just said, Usagi... I can't reciprocate it. My  heart belongs to Mina, and only Mina. I'll always protect you, as the  Princess and as my friend, but I can't love you like that. I also  realize... I can't love anyone else like that either. Only Mina.</p>
<p>“That...  that makes me believe... the one thing that was hindering me from being  with her... is whether or not I can accept that. We don't live in an  age where we can have children without the 'help' of a male. I've  always hated that fact. Maybe in the future, we will, but not now.</p>
<p>“This...  in turn... means several things. One, by lineage, there won't be heirs  to take on our names. Unless we adopt, but that isn't the same as a  child born from us, and only us. Two, unless we trick the priest-  Kami-sama forbid- we'll never be 'married' by law. Not in this day and  age. I doubt it will really happen in the future either. Three, I can  be happy that I won't have to watch my family die of old age; I only  have to worry about Mina falling in battle. But I can deal with that;  if I'm on the battlefield then, or afterwards, I can deal with that.  Four, loving the Senshi of Love, I can feel confident that she knows  how much I love her- if she doesn't, I can try again and again until  she knows it by heart- and will never really leave me after she knows  we're together. She knows how much heartbreak hurts, so unless it's  circumstances that can't be avoided anyway, I know I can depend on her  to be there for me. Five,” Rei pauses to widen her ironic smile, “she  understands me in a way no one else, male or female, can. And for that,  I have no reason left to believe that she and I <em>don't</em> belong together.”</p>
<p>Rei meets my gaze, and I can see the sadness in her eyes. I try to deny it, but I know it's because she misses Mina.</p>
<p>Something  other than my heart pulses inside me, and I suddenly feel pure hatred  for Mina swell and grow within my bodily limits. How dare she steal my  Rei from me. The witch! She's brainwashed my Rei! I won't stand for it!  Rei is mine!</p>
<p>A red haze filters through my eyesight, and I take  it to be Rei's passionate flames. I can't hear her call my name, even  as I see her lips move. She's clutching my arms, shaking me, but I  don't feel any pain. I'm numb. I force my body to lean forward, and it  instantly complies.</p>
<p>I'm kissing her! I'm actually kissing her!  Kami-sama, you must have blessed these lips; they are so perfect, so  soft, so delicious...</p>
<p>She pushes me away, but my body won't even listen to <em>me</em> anymore. That little voice that would ask me to stop, that she's my  friend, that I know she doesn't want this, but I don't care. I close my  ears to it. I approach her, she's in the middle of her transformation  sequence- No! I grab her arms, disrupting the change. I clutch tightly,  trying to kiss her again, but she seems to know my goal, and fights  against it.</p>
<p>We miss the post.. I trip over the edge of the  gazebo... I lose my grip on her... I'm falling... falling... Rei, help  me, it hurts...</p>
<p><strong>Setsuna's POV</strong></p>
<p>“She's close, I can feel it! Sets-chan, do you sense it? They're close!”</p>
<p>Mina  turns around, an eccentric grin plastered on her face, her hands behind  her back to further signify that she is honestly and innocently happy.  I can only give her a small smile and nod in return.</p>
<p>We reach the  hill, but just as she starts making ready to climb it, I notice  something and bid her to wait. A curious look in her eye, she nods and  stops. I start to walk around the hill, and before long, I see an  unnatural path of weeds growing in a particular spot. Weary of poison  and danger, I use a stick to clear a spot, and I'm rewarded with a  clear cave entrance. Mina looks over my shoulder in awe.</p>
<p>“Wow Sets... how'd you know that was there?”</p>
<p>I smile wanly. “Intuition I suppose. Come, let's see what this cave has to offer.”</p>
<p>She  hesitates, and I know she's looking towards whatever direction she  feels Rei from. I don't feel it, even for the Princess, but I lost  track of them dozens of yards back. The only one I can sense is Mina,  and I can visibly <em>see</em> her. “What about climbing...?”</p>
<p>I  shake my head. “Rei-san has most likely already climbed it, and will  soon come down. If you like, we can leave a marker, to tell her that  we've been here, and she should wait for us if we don't come out before  she descends.”</p>
<p>She jumps up and down with excitement. Then,  concentrating, she summons whip, and unleashes it on the nearest tree.  As I clear away a sufficient amount of the weeds that act as a guard, I  watch her at work, and soon realize her intentions. Eventually, she  claps the imaginary dirt off her hands, signifying that she has  finished her ten-minute masterpiece.</p>
<p>The tree is alight with  golden heart formations, blazing on each and every leaf, and encircling  like a vine on the bark. A tree specially done for the Winter Solstice  Festival could not have been more exquisite. “How long will that last?”  I ask her ask she walks back over.</p>
<p>She grins and gives me a 'V'  sign for... victory in this case, I suppose. “No worries, no worries;  so long as I don't die or lose my powers, that'll stay bright.”</p>
<p>I cast her a concerned gaze. “Won't that detract from your normal output of power? We might need it inside.”</p>
<p>She  grinned and waved it off, explaining, “I'll be fine, I'll be fine. I  have energy to burn because of how much my love and need for Rei-chan  has been growing. (w)”</p>
<p>That explanation, at least, I can believe  very well. I know she has tried to suppress it the past few days, but  it becomes blatantly obvious at night when she talks and moves in her  sleep. She misses Rei. I can see that very well. “Since you seem to  have so much light, might you lead the way? If I had my staff, I would  do so surely, but as it is...”</p>
<p>Mina is happy to comply. It seems  the opportunity to leave a big fat beacon for Rei in the form of a  heart tattooed tree has completely outweighed her wish to climb the  hill to see Rei sooner. She walks in, holding an orb of light over her  hand, and I soon follow.</p>
<p>The tunnel is small, but there's just  enough room for one and a half people to walk side by side. It goes on  for perhaps twenty yards, before I start to feel something inside me  changing. I look up as it momentarily fades, and I see Mina's features  highlighted by the orb.</p>
<p>In that instant, I know she is the one  and only Senshi of Beauty. To me, no beauty is parallel to hers, nor so  perfectly preserved. Her fair skin, her luxurious hair, her well-toned  limbs, those delicate features... all is aglow, exuding warmth, love,  shining with happiness.</p>
<p>I want to share in that light. I wish to  feel all that for myself. I don't remember doing so, but I call out  something that makes her stop. Before she can turn around all the way,  I'm holding her in an embrace, not too tight, not too informal. Just...</p>
<p>I  can smell the scent of her love, that which she was bathed in as a mere  babe. That which exudes from her very existence. “I love you, I love  you so much.”</p>
<p>It isn't until she responds, that I realize I've  said this aloud, but I no longer care. She puts me at arm's length, and  smiles at me, softly, gently. “I know, Setsuna, I know. I'm just sorry  I can't say the same.”</p>
<p>An irrational side surfaces, what I felt  just moments before, and my grip on her tightens. She squeaks, looking  at my hands, and then back at me. “Sets...una?”</p>
<p>“Love me.” I plead. “For one night, love me as you would your lover, and let me remember it.”</p>
<p>Her  smile changes origin, but it's a smile nonetheless. Slowly, she reaches  up to take hold of my wrists, and gently makes me release my hold. “You  know I can't do that, Sets. I won't break Rei's trust. Besides... I  couldn't... 'love you as a lover' anyway... even for a night. I... I'm  not the one for you, Setsuna.”</p>
<p>The rash spirit fluctuated again-  I held her shoulders and kissed her. She's surprised, and I sense  that's the only reason her mouth is open to me. But even as I chance a  moment to deepen the kiss, she pulls away, stepping back. That  warmth... I have to have it! I felt it for a blissful moment... in that  kiss... Mina! Let me feel it again!</p>
<p>“Don't do this, Setsuna... Don't do this to yourself.” I still advance. “Stop! This... this isn't like you! Snap out of it!”</p>
<p>Her  words slowly fade away, and a red haze filters my vision. I approach  her again. She streams the light so that it follows her, growing  longer, as she turns and sprints down the passage. I give chase, though  my limbs begin to feel numb and leaden.</p>
<p>Moments later, I hear her  squeal echo through the tunnel, and I inherently pick up the pace. It  isn't long before I come to a staircase leading down, and I assume  she's tripped and fallen. I lethargically make my way down. There's an  unladylike “Umph” that signifies Mina has reached the bottom of the  staircase, I try to force my muscles to go faster, and I trip. The way  is a lot faster, but had I not been numbed, I fear it would have hurt  drastically. In any case, it seems Mina had not been able to move, for  I landed in a quite compromising position on top of her.</p>
<p>She is  facing me, and her eyes open wide at that moment. Mina struggles to  throw me off, but something about my leaden muscles make this  impossible. I move down to kiss her, and she turns her head to the  side. I get her ear. It doesn't matter much to me; I begin to kiss it,  suckle it, lick it softly. She struggles even harder at the first  contact, but eventually, all movement ceases.</p>
<p>Believing it to  mean she'll allow me to continue without a fight, I slowly begin to  unbutton her blouse. Her hand stops me, and I realize I never really  held back any of her limbs. Her voice is soft, but it echoes. “This  isn't right, Setsuna. Stop this. You're above this, I know you are.”</p>
<p>A  rough snarl is emitted from my throat as I nuzzle her neck. A voice  that we both know not to my mine, spoke out, “As long as I get what I  want, I am willing to shed dignity.”</p>
<p>She stares at me a moment, and then her head jerks to the side. I can hardly hear anymore, but I sense another's arrival. <em>No, she is </em>mine<em>! No one else shall have her!</em></p>
<p>But  in my moment of distraction, she's summoned a small, heart-shaped  shock, and she presses it to my forehead. Her face is spinning all  around... and the last thing I see are her gentle eyes... the eyes of  one who rejected me, but had no wish for me to be hurt by it.</p>
<p>An unlikely outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Rei's POV:</strong></p>
<p>Running  after the Princess, I just barely manage to grab her hand before the  rest of her body drops out of my line of vision. A split-second later,  I follow her. Idiot Bunny that she is, she just <em>has</em> to go  tumbling into a burrow that was meant for someone more than half her  mass. Nevertheless, I manage to curl around her so as to protect her  from the greater brunt of the bumps.</p>
<p>The long spiral tunnel  eventually comes to an end, and I unwrap myself from Usagi. Looking  around, and wincing as I raise my hand to light a small fire, I see  that we're in a rather spacious cavern. The hill must be almost  completely hollow- and the hole deliberate.</p>
<p>Before I can think on it any longer, Usagi's revived and starting on me again. Kami-sama help me, I know she's possessed by <em>something</em>! I try to push her away, to move, but even the attempt aches my bones. <em>Damnit Usagi, I know you're the Princess, but stay the hell away from me!</em></p>
<p>It's then that I catch sight of a dim light from the other side. <em>Could it be...?</em> Despite how much it hurts, I try to rise as I call out, “MINA! ARE YOU HERE?”</p>
<p>I  hear a rustling, but there's no other reply. The light momentarily  flares, before going completely out. I nearly lose all hope, but then  the dim light is back, and it's moving.</p>
<p>I try to stand again, but Usagi, perhaps realizing I can't get away with her on top of me, maneuvers to be just so. <em>Gah! Usagi, when we get back- I'm putting you on a diet!</em></p>
<p>The footsteps echo as they draw nearer, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. It's Mina. It just <em>has</em> to be her...!</p>
<p>I  hear rustling again, but it's one of a different nature, and much  closer to me. Even in my dim lighting, I can feel the heat rise to my  cheeks, as the leaf dress I made for Usagi falls apart, and the slashes  the ragged rocks in the tunnel made in my shirt leave the garment in a  similar manner. I struggle to throw her off me again, but the pain  becomes even more noticeable as a strange draft blows through the  cavern.</p>
<p>Momentarily, I debate smacking her over the head hard  enough so that she becomes unconscious, but there are two problems with  that. One, she's the heir to the Kingdom, and hitting her that hard, no  matter what the circumstances, might be considered a treason of sorts.  Two, my whole body hurts so much right now- I don't think I could  summon the power to even if it was allowed. Still, the fire might be-  psh, never mind that- it's gone out on me.</p>
<p>And then I hear it. “R-rei-chan?”</p>
<p>I  look up. There she is. Her hair is messy- the bow's missing- a few of  her buttons are missing, she's barefoot, and there's a dumbfounded look  on her face, but yes, it's her all right.</p>
<p>“Mi...na.” I find that  my voice is hoarse, and cough to clear it. Bracing myself, I spurt out,  “Since you seem able to move your limbs... think you can help get this  Royal anvil off me?”</p>
<p>She hesitates, and I suppose it's because of  our state of undress, but then she starts forward. That's when I see  something that makes my own eyes widen in surprise. Setsuna saunters up  behind her- from what I can see, outer garments shed- and wraps her  arms around Mina's neck, holding her back. Mina's eyes widen as well.  Even from the distance we're apart, I can sense her shiver as Setsuna  whispers something in her ear.</p>
<p>But she shakes it off and takes a  deep breath. Then she does something I can't do; she uses her Senshi  powers against a fellow teammate, and Setsuna falls to the ground.  Bending down, Mina then does something to her hand, and with the tips  of her fingers, emblazons something on Setsuna's neck. With a wistful  smile, Mina rearranges Setsuna's limbs, parts her hair away from her  sleeping face, and then stands to make her way towards me.</p>
<p>As if  completely understanding Usagi's condition, she avoids Usagi's venomous  swats, tranquilizers her- without getting me- and then places that mark  on her neck. As she slides Usagi off me, I see that it's the shape of a  golden flower. Still, I can't help but ask as she rearranges Usagi  comfortably as she did Setsuna, “What did you do to them?”</p>
<p>With  that same motherly smile- I realize that's what it is now- she answers  me as she brings over the largest remaining leaf, and drapes it over  Usagi. “It's just a small tranquilizer. It's for emergency purposes if  someone is delirious and needs sleep, or if you just don't want to hurt  the target.”</p>
<p>After finishing, she extends a hand down to me, and  suggests, “Now what do you say we find the source of all this mayhem  and set it right?”</p>
<p>I try to smile but even that hurts. She sees  me wince, and instantly, she bends down next to me. “What's wrong?  Where does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Through a grimace, I answer, “Everywhere. I  rolled around Usagi to protect her as we tumbled down the chute, and  all the rocks got me.” I hiss through my teeth as she traces one deep  abrasion on my arm, before adding, “I would transform, knowing that  alone would get rid of most of it, but I can't seem to raise enough  strength to go through with it. But... ah... how are you faring?”</p>
<p>Mina  grins at me sheepishly. “We found a staircase down here after a  horizontal tunnel- and I fell down all five-hundred something of the  steps. Somehow, I can still move. But like I told Setsuna, my love  gives me enough energy to not only stay conscious and strong, but it  heals my wounds a bit faster.”</p>
<p>I can't help but verify, “Love for who?”</p>
<p>She  gives me a good-humored stern look as if daring me to ask that again,  knowing the answer. But she laughs it off and instead asks back, “Do  you still love me, Rei-chan?”</p>
<p>She asks it so easily, as if this  is an everyday question, a joke, but I can see in her eyes that she  really wants to be sure of my answer.</p>
<p>Playing off another grimace, I whisper her, “Move closer, my voice is starting to fail me.”</p>
<p>Believing  it, she leans over until we're almost an inch apart, and I close the  distance to press my lips against hers. She smiles into the kiss, and  deepens it. But as soon as she starts to push me back, we both hear my  spine crack, and she pulls away quickly, concern written all over her  face.</p>
<p>As if it wasn't obvious, she murmurs, “Rei-chan... you really <em>are</em> in pain, aren't you?”</p>
<p>Through clench teeth, I hiss a few haggard breaths, before I can manage, “Nice diagnosis, Nurse Mina. Now got any painkillers?”</p>
<p>There's  a mysterious glint in her eyes as she smiles, and she tilts up my head.  “Would the Patient be willing to work with my ministrations?”</p>
<p>I try to smile back, but it really does hurt too much. “So long as you don't make it worse or kill me, do whatever you like.”</p>
<p>The  smile widens, and she stands to walk around me. “All right... just  remember it tends to get worse before it gets better, all right? Here  goes...!”</p>
<p>I didn't think it was possible, but that day, Mina succeeded in extracting a howl of pain from me.</p>
<p><strong>Mina's POV:</strong></p>
<p>“There now, that wasn't so bad, was it?”</p>
<p>She glares daggers at me, and I smile innocently in an attempt to alleviate it. “Define bad, and whatever you answer, I'll say <em>that</em> was a hundred times worse. Mina?” I hum questioningly, and she adds,  closing her eyes, “Do the world a favor and never go into the medical  field.”</p>
<p>I blink in surprise. I learned that remedy from my aunt, the masseuse! Hmm... did I do it wrong? “Does it still hurt?”</p>
<p>I'm  sure she's about to say “Of course it does,” but then, surprise passes  her expression, and she easily moves her limbs about. “Wow... it really  doesn't hurt! Hnh.. you actually got something right for once, imagine  that.”</p>
<p>I puff my cheeks in a stubborn pout at the retort. “Hmph, see if I ever help you out like that again.”</p>
<p>She  grins at me then, and on rickity steps, stands and extends her hand to  me now. I take it, and in an instant, she's embraced me. “Thank you,  Mina. But you know... if you never help me again... how can I ever find  an excuse to really <em>thank</em> you...?”</p>
<p>For some reason, heat  begins to rise to my cheeks, but as I kiss her cheek and move away,  tugging at her hand, I tell her, “I'll take a very temporary rain check  on that one. Come on, let's get the lusty source out of the way so our  two stalkers don't revive and start after us again.”</p>
<p>As we find a  third doorway to go through, we head towards it, still talking. “I  suppose that means Setsuna was possessed by the same thing Usagi was?”</p>
<p>I  couldn't help a giggle, knowing the feeling that I had sensed from  Setsuna, Usagi, and the other now dormant thing in this cave.  “Possessed, sure, but I don't think this is our typical Youma, if it's  an evil thing at all.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing, nothing,” I grin as I wave the question off. “It should be just ahead, come on!”</p>
<p>I  see the stone upon the altar, and I race towards it, the still slightly  weary Rei following behind. If I wasn't already sure of it by now, the  caption inscribed into the side of the altar proved it. I pointed at it  with as much excitement as I could reveal, and started reading it aloud  as Rei came up behind me, resting her chin on my shoulder as she  followed my narration.</p>
<p align="center">“<strong>THE STONE OF LUST</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Dated 1000 B.C.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>I,  Aiyokuno Gokai°, hereby declare that this artifact will be the monument  of my life's work. For many years I have toiled alongside Yaku Zaishi°°  and Dou Seiai°°° to create this masterpiece.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>The  Stone of Lust is a unique creation that draws upon the nearest source  of the most powerful entity known to Man- “Love” and from it also  extracts its counterpart “Passion” to produce the untouchable substance  referred to as “Lust”.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>It is designed to  unite two people who, under other circumstances, would not be able to  find Love in another. That is, this was the original plan, but  somewhere along the line, our experiment went awry. The Love it  produces, while valiant, is false, and will fail once out of contact  with the Stone. To spare people of the misery of either isolation or  broken faith, I have sealed it away on this here island. Should any  others arrive after we depart, and wish to deactivate it, there is but  a simple, though rare, antidote.</strong></p>
<p><strong>'Recipe'</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 People on the Island that still retain full use of their own senses even in close proximity of the stone<br />
  </strong><strong>-1 of which is the embodiment of Love and has full control over thus<br />
  </strong><strong>-1 of which is the embodiment of Passion and has full control over thus<br />
</strong><strong>-Both of which were in love with each other before arriving on this here Island</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directions:  While in direct contact with each other in a frenzy of submitting to  self inspired “lust”, one or both may touch the Stone, transferring a  register of the involved parties' emotions. If the true love between  the people is stronger than the false love of the Stone, the Stone will  power down, and its effect on any other patrons will be nullified until  the same party, or one of stronger love, touches the stone again, in  the same fashion.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Signed,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gokai, Zaishi, and Seiai</strong></p>
<p><strong>P.S.  If we are still alive when someone succeeds in turning the Stone off,  if it is possible, please record it and send to the following address.”</strong></p>
<p>At  that point, I had to stop reading as I'm overcome with giggles. I  happen to glance at her as she does the same, and our noses touch. We  both collapse in laughter.</p>
<p>When our mirth has subsided, I look at her through one eye- the other squeezing out a tear- and verify, “One Senshi of Passion?”</p>
<p>She grins. “Check. One Senshi of Love?”</p>
<p>I grin to match hers. “Check. In love since before the island?”</p>
<p>We say in unison, “Check!”</p>
<p>Then  Rei adds, lightly nudging me to the floor- which is remarkably clean  for being however old it is, and being underground- “Any chance you'd  be willing to pick up that rain check now?”</p>
<p>I put a finger to my lips, as if considering it. “Well, I have nothing better to do so...” I shrug. “Sure, why not.”</p>
<p>As  she bends down and kisses me, a distant part of my mind wonders if I  can touch the Stone at the right moment, or if she'll make me forget  all about it. But as we deepen the kiss, I shrug it off- I can always  make her go for another round.</p>
<p><strong>Time Lapse</strong></p>
<p>I stir  from a very sated sleep, and turn over, startling myself awake upon  realizing there's a body missing that should be with me. Sitting up, I  look around, and indeed, Rei is nowhere to be seen. I concentrate my  power, and I sense her at the top of the hill. I sigh with regret, but  then a smile grows as I anticipate how she dressed for it, knowing her  clothes are still in shreds. I pick up, dust and throw on my shirt and  pants. I'm about to sprint for the outdoors, but then I remember the  Stone, and deciding not to leave anything to chance, I grab it and  stick it in my pocket before running off.</p>
<p>Briefly, in the first  cavern, I check to make sure the Princess and Setsuna are all right-  they are, and they're still sound asleep. I move them both over to the  end of the staircase, so when they wake up, they catch the hint and  come up after us. Then I bound up the steps three at a time.</p>
<p>The  sight that meets me upon exiting the cave makes me pause, but I smile  and begin to climb. Rei's been here- only she could have wrapped every  single one of my heart insignia's in a little flame. Poor tree.</p>
<p>It's  all but forgotten though, as I reach my destination. She's there,  staring at the horizon whose sun is barely rising, and I briefly wonder  if I should bother her at all.</p>
<p>I can't see her face, but I don't  doubt that she's in some form of meditation, or at least, in deep  contemplation. She's wearing her sailor fuku, which, all things  considered, is probably the easiest outfit at hand.</p>
<p>“Mina.”</p>
<p>The  name on her lips, gone as quick as it had come, startles me out of my  dazed expression. She doesn't turn to me, but I know she knows I'm  there. So I climb up all the way and answer in a drawl,  “Yyyyeeeeeeeeessss?”</p>
<p>Apparently, she really <em>didn't </em>know I  was there, because she jumps and swirls around. Hm, maybe I'm  underestimating her this morning. But just as quickly, she turns back  around, without another word. I walk over and sit beside her.</p>
<p>We  lapse into a silence, and, as sleep begins to call me again, that's  fine. At least I know where she is now. But just as I drift off, I hear  her voice, and instantly force myself to wake up.</p>
<p>“They cast a  smoke signal for us... they're all gathered. Once the Princess and  Setsuna recover, we'll head there. They've probably already found a way  off.”</p>
<p>Even if I'm awake, I'm still really sleepy, so my assent  comes out in an incoherent murmur. A few moments later, I feel her  gloved fingers move stray hairs behind my ear, and caresses my cheek. I  smile and try to lean into it, but I'm too lethargic. Oh well... it  still feels nice.</p>
<p>“Sleep Mina... sleep. I'll wake you when they come out. So... just sleep.”</p>
<p>Somehow,  there's something hidden in that voice that makes me wonder, and I can  never deny my curiosity anything. So I control my breathing and my  energy level to a point where I really could be considered sleeping,  and I wait to listen.</p>
<p>There's a long silence, and all she does is  run the back of her fingers over my cheek. Then, just as I can stand to  stay awake no longer, I hear her whisper, “What's wrong with me, Mina?  I love you so much, but... why can't I...”</p>
<p>At that point, I curse  my brain for failing on me and shutting down to hibernate. When I come  to again, I'm on Setsuna's back, and she's walking. I raise my head and  look around. Usagi's next to Setsuna, and her face lights upon seeing  that I've awoken. I ignore her little comments of delight, as I see  some twenty paces ahead, Rei.</p>
<p>Something's wrong. Something's <em>horribly</em> wrong. I motion for Setsuna to let me off, and she complies. Briefly,  I'm sidetracked by my concern that last night might have left ill will,  but there's none in her eyes, or Usagi's. I smile at them, say I'm  going to go up to Rei, and leave them to do just that. There's no bad  feelings from them.</p>
<p>But as I glance at Rei's slightly downtrodden  gaze, lifeless as if her body is a robot that moves without  consciousness, I worry. I wave a hand in front of her face, and she  absently swats it away. Her expression doesn't change.</p>
<p>“Rei...?”</p>
<p>Her reply is quick, soft, and abrupt. “I'm fine Mina.”</p>
<p>I don't... I <em>can't</em> believe her. There's something bothering her. I say just so.</p>
<p>She  doesn't answer me. But ever so slightly, her speed increases. When she  passes me and I'm about to follow, she tells me, “There are man-eating  snakes here. I killed one just after waking up. Make sure the Princess  stays safe.”</p>
<p>I want to question her further, find out what's  bothering her, but... the snake thing gets to me, and I glance back.  When I look at Rei again, she's already fading behind a tree. But she's  safe. I skip over to Usagi and Setsuna, and with Usagi in the middle, I  keep my eye on Rei.</p>
<p>She worries me, but until we make sure the Princess is safe, and off the island, I suppose I'll have to wait.</p>
<p>When the time comes, I hope I'm not too late.</p>
<p>A/N:  For the degree signs, I looked up in a Japanese dictionary to find  the names, and these are the translations (that I found):<br />
  <em><br />
    °Aiyokuno Gokai </em>Passion/Love/Lust of Misunderstanding</p>
<p><em>°°Yaku Zaishi </em>Chemist/Pharmacist</p>
<p><em>°°°Dou Seiai </em>Homosexual Love</p>
