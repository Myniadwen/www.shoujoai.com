- That was an outrageous display, Miss Kaioh! I will have you know that 
you&#39;ll receive no payment whatsoever for this performance and consider 
yourself luckyif we don&#39;t sue you and your despicable partner!

A loud, heated voice echoing between the walls as heavy feet drum over 
the floor, trying to catch up with an elegant pair of high heels.

- Oh, that&#39;s perfectly alright, Reynolds-sensei. Fortunately, I didn&#39;t 
come here for the money; the payment was quite insignificant as it was.

A white silk dress shining in the artificial yellow light of the hallway 
as the sharp turn of the bearer makes her aquamarine hair bounce around 
her face. A softness in expression and voice that does not conceal the 
sarcasm of the reply.

- I&#39;ll press charges!

A threatening, self-justified murmur as a fat finger jabs angrily at the 
woman&#39;s shoulder, unsuccessfully trying to make her lose her poise.

- But we didn&#39;t do anything illegal, now, did we?

A truly concerned question asked in great earnestness, dark blue eyes 
shining with the flame of victory, not dimmed by any kind of 
intimidation.

- You must understand that the moral codex of America and Japan 
respectively are vastly different...

An excuse; half regretting, half accusing but bitter all the same.

- Maybe it&#39;s not the Japanese one that is wrong?

The sound of heels against the floor; a slow pace at first as a 
thoughtful glance is aimed at the enormous silhouette visible over one 
slender, bare shoulder followed by a smile bordering on friendly; 
coloured serene by an inborn compassion.

- Michiru, there&#39;s a Brad Summers who wants to meet you and properly 
congratulate you on the &quot;awesome show&quot; as he called it.

Dark grey eyes intentionally ignoring the bulky shadow of the man left a 
couple of steps behind as long legs clad in light silk trousers come to 
a halt next to the shorter woman. Attention fixed on her partner, the 
owner of the somewhat hoarse voice smirks around the American words of 
her message.

- Can you follow him to my dressing room in ten minutes time? Ara, and 
please bring these flowers as well, would you?

A couple of beautiful bouquets change hands, the warmth of the answering 
enquiry reflected in a caring gaze passing between the blonde, tomboyish 
woman and the smiling, aqua-haired violinist. A frail melody not unlike 
&quot;Shojo no Koi&quot; is traceable in the air between them, audible to those 
who listen carefully.

- Hai. You... don&#39;t need help with anything?

A suspicious, teal gaze moves to the still present form of the offending 
organizer further down the corridor.

- Daijoobu-yo. I can take care of this myself.

A teasing joke, softened by impeccably manicured fingers brushing short 
locks of dark blonde hair out of the way before her partner disappears 
around the nearest corner.

- Freaks! That&#39;s what you are... FREAKS!

A livid whisper, the last word screamed in a furious manner, emphasized 
by a vein bulging underneath the flushed skin stretching out over the 
white-haired man&#39;s temple.

- Maybe we are, but then again... normality is such a vague concept, ne?

A look of silk-wrapped steel flashes in eyes with the strength of the 
ocean, a smiling mouth delivering the final hit to the wall of 
intolerance between them, leaving Luke Reynolds to gape at Kaioh 
Michiru, dumbfounded

A polite farewell slices the quiet open like a sword...

- For this opportunity to participate in your concert, domo arigato 
gozaimasu. And now I bid you goodnight, Reynolds-sensei.

In front of a small dressing room, the Senshi of the Sea stops, bowing 
respectfully. Without her waiting for a response, the door is closed 
softly in a sweaty face, red from seething anger.

Epilogue

Once safely inside, Michiru leans her head back against the doorframe 
and laughs, one bent finger pressed to her lips; unregretful and 
unapologetic.
