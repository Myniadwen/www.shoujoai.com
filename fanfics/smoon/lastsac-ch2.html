----------------------------------------------------------------------

Haruka twirled awkwardly, her nose crinkled in disgust.  &quot;Do I have to 
wear this?  I like my suits much better.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re a princess, Haruka, and should dress the part.  That means an 
actual dress.&quot;
 
Haruka huffed and dropped onto her bed.  &quot;Why do I have to go, anyway?  
She&#39;s the princess of the Moon and I won&#39;t ever have anything to do with 
her.&quot;
 
&quot;Sure you will.  We of the Outer Kingdoms must protect the Moon Kingdom 
from threats outside the Solar System, and one day you will carry that 
burden.&quot;
 
&quot;You mean a Sailor Senshi?  I&#39;m one of them?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, just like your mother.  I&#39;ll show you her sword and henshin stick 
in a moment.  One day you&#39;ll wield them, and you need to be familiar 
with your power.&quot;
 
Haruka smiled, forgetting the hated dress in her excitement as she 
followed her father into the tallest tower of their castle.  He opened 
the only door in the topmost level and stepped inside.  Haruka gasped at 
the treasures hidden inside, but her gaze was drawn to the powerful 
sword basking in the light from the single tiny window in the room.  
Beside it, on a shallow shelf on the side of the pedestal, sat a blue 
and yellow henshin stick, and Haruka knew that it was hers.  She reached 
out her hand, and the stick flew over to her, a part of her from the 
moment she was born and her mother relinquished her claim. 
 
&quot;Mother was Sailor Uranus.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, she was.  No touching the sword, daughter.  It&#39;ll be yours soon 
enough.  Your mother was the daughter of Uranus, princess of Ten&#39;ousei 
and it was her destiny to fight for our kingdom.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m the Princess of Ten&#39;ousei now; is it my destiny to fight?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, one day.  But not now.  You&#39;ll carry your henshin stick to the 
princess&#39;s party, but the sword is too big for you now.  Now, finish 
getting dressed so you can meet the princesses of the other planets.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka followed her father into the palace, proud of the henshin stick 
her mother had used, uncomfortable in the huge group of royals and their 
subjects in the Moon castle.  She knew that she was one of them, but she 
felt so different.  She took her place in the throne room as everyone 
waited for the queen to emerge.  Haruka looked around, easily able to 
recognize the royals of the other kingdoms, and none of their princesses 
were as old as her.  One of them, a slender little girl with soft aqua 
hair and strong sapphire blue eyes, caught Haruka&#39;s attention, and she 
touched her father&#39;s arm.
 
&quot;Who is that girl?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s Kaiou Michiru, Kaiousei&#39;s princess, future Sailor Neptune, 
only daughter of Kaiou Shousha.&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s cute.  Where&#39;s her father?&quot;
 
&quot;He died.  You will meet her and the other girls later, after Queen 
Serenity arrives.&quot;
 
&quot;Tell me who the other ones are, Father.&quot;
 
&quot;The tall girl there with brown hair is Princess of Mokusei, future 
Sailor Jupiter, Kino Makoto.  Her parents there are King Meisha and 
Queen Meika.  Beside Jupiter&#39;s Royal Family is the family of their 
closest ally Kingdom, Suisei&#39;s, led by King Mizuno Kashin and Queen 
Amami.  Kashin-kun&#39;s father died in the same battle that took the 
previous Neptunian King, Saturn&#39;s previous king and queen, and Queen 
Pluto&#39;s two brothers and mother, making her the queen, though she had 
been Sailor Pluto and the Guardian of the Gate of Time for a while by 
then.  That was the last great battle against Queen Metallia&#39;s forces, 
completing the seal started generations ago.  The queen of Pluto has 
already paid her respects, so she&#39;s not here today.  She&#39;s the one that 
introduced me to your mother.  She has no family left.  Those girls will 
be Sailor Senshi even as you are Sailor Uranus, and one day you two will 
fight together to defend the Silver Millennium.&quot;
 
&quot;I think I&#39;ve met the little girl with yellow hair.  Isn&#39;t she Kino 
Minako, the Princess of Kinsei?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, Haruka-chan.  Her mother, Queen Aino Asakaze, is Sailor Venus, and 
beside her is King Shinrai, a close friend of the Ten&#39;ou Family.  
Kinsei&#39;s partner is Kasei, and the tall woman with red-black hair is 
Queen Hino Rikuriko, the current Sailor Mars.  Her husband is King 
Akaneiro and their daughter is little Rei.  Like the Royals of the Kaiou 
Line, Royals of the Hino Line can often see or sense some of the future, 
though not as strongly or with as much accuracy.  Here comes Queen 
Serenity.&quot;
 
With little more warning than that, the tall, smiling, silver-haired 
queen entered the throne room, her long hair floating behind her.  She 
carried her newborn daughter in her arms, her tall, dark-haired husband 
following in her wake, his garnet eyes glancing at all of the lesser 
royals.  The kings and queens of the other planets, their young 
daughters quick to copy their actions, bowed.
 
&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; Queen Serenity whispered, her voice easily 
audible to the gathered royals.  She placed her tiny heir in the crib 
beside the thrones and gestured for the royal families to take a look.  
Haruka followed Koshu, eyes wide at the tiny girl.
 
&quot;She&#39;s going to be my queen?&quot;
 
&quot;One day, my child.  She&#39;s your princess now, and you must always 
protect her, no matter what and regardless of the sacrifice.&quot;
 
Haruka touched baby Serenity&#39;s white cheek, one golden curl brushing her 
finger, and she smiled.  &quot;I will.  But how will I recognize her in the 
future?&quot;
 
Queen Serenity gasped, sensing that Ten&#39;ousei&#39;s princess was not 
speaking about her future but her next life.  &quot;She&#39;ll save the world as 
Sailor Moon without losing any friends, she&#39;ll love everyone without 
prejudice, she&#39;ll save your life even if you try to kill her, and she 
will reveal her true power if you confront her.  When you feel the need 
to bow to her, you&#39;ll know that she&#39;s your princess,&quot; Haruka&#39;s father 
answered, sure of his response.  &quot;I learned that from your mother; she 
tested Queen Serenity that way once.  When the time comes, you&#39;ll know.&quot;

Haruka looked at the henshin stick in her hands, running her finger over 
the round blue representation of her planet, touching the yellow star on 
top, and she curled her thin fingers around the stick itself.  &quot;I&#39;ll 
protect her, Father.  I&#39;ll protect your daughter, Your Majesty; I 
promise.&quot;

Queen Serenity bowed her head and clasped Haruka&#39;s hand briefly.  &quot;You 
have your mother&#39;s fire, young Sailor Uranus.  I trust you.&quot;</pre>
