Laodameia rearranged herself into a more comfortable position as she 
lounged contentedly on a large pile of soft, plush cushions. She let out 
a sigh of satisfaction then, with elegance, brought the fine crystal 
flute she held between delicate fingers to her lips and took a sip of 
the delectable red wine. Laodameia was enjoying this world. She rather 
liked the human culture and found their food and drink quite agreeable. 
Not to mention the lovely humans themselves.

The gorgeous woman stretched out her left arm and admired its graceful 
shape. It was sheer splendour. She had truly grasped the meaning of 
human beauty and adored her human form; it was absolutely perfect in 
every way. Laodameia moved to put down her wineglass, not even bothering 
to look at what she was doing, and a tray was hurriedly extended to meet 
it.

The pink-haired woman glanced absently down at the scantly clad human 
male kneeling to her right who looked upon her with utter rapture and 
veneration. That was something else Laodameia liked about the humans; 
their minds could be so easily dominated. It had been a simple matter 
for her to waltz into the five-star hotel in downtown Tokyo and 
completely take over the top floor for herself, all through the power of 
suggestion. She found it enormously delightful that the humans lacked 
the mental strength to pose even the most marginal of contests to her 
indomitable will. Laodameia was definitely going to relish her stay in 
this dimension, even if she did end up slumming on most of these 
&#39;operations&#39; as Makareus liked to call them.

Laodameia let out another sigh, but this time, it was a small one of 
mild irritation as she looked around her penthouse suite. It was the 
best, and biggest, room in the hotel. Although the d&eacute;cor of the suite 
and the luxuries in it weren&#39;t up to her usual standards, they still 
provided enough comfort and pleasure. Just barely.

The alluring creature&#146;s deep pink eyes, the shade almost purplish, then 
moved to take in the exquisite human female who knelt on her left. The 
female beheld her vacantly, totally consumed by feelings of love and 
worship. Laodameia&#146;s sensuous lips curled into a faint smile at her pet. 
The gesture was enough to make the human gasp in delight and form a 
trace of joyful tears in her eyes. Laodameia&#146;s smile grew wider. But no 
matter; sometimes even slumming could be quite fun.

Laodameia broke her gaze away from the female and ran her fingers 
through her dark pink hair several times to fluff up the waves of silky 
tresses. She wondered how Khairephon was doing back in.... Yokohama was 
it? Though the names of the human cities were peculiar ones, they all 
seemed alike to her. Laodameia imagined the ruffian was busy indulging 
in the same boorish &#145;hobbies&#146; he always practiced; inflicting crude and 
violent behaviour upon the human populace. She made a disapproving sound 
in the back of her throat at the thought of her younger brother&#39;s 
habits. Oh well, to each their own, Laodameia supposed. Even she, on 
occasion, took amusement in exacting the most delicious tortures upon 
her pets, though hers were much more... refined than her fierce 
brother&#146;s. And Laodameia&#146;s pets seemed to enjoy her ministrations 
considerably more than Khairephon&#146;s victims did, also.

Laodameia pulled out her fan and started to fan herself lightly, a fond 
smile gracing her features. The relationship she had with her younger 
brother was certainly a strange one. Despite their heated bickering, 
they shared a sort of... affection for one another that was rather rare 
back in their home dimension. Laodameia had long ago ceased trying to 
analyse the foreign emotion she felt for Khairephon; it was quite beyond 
even what her considerable mental capabilities could understand.

Khairephon reciprocated her sentiment in his own way. He usually lent 
his &#39;dear sister&#39; a few of his most adept youma warriors as protection 
when she went travelling to another plane alone, or with other siblings. 
This trip had been no different. All of the creatures chosen to 
accompany Laodameia had been most pleased to do so and, in turn, she 
found them useful both as an active part of her personal guard and in 
the sorties against the Sailor Senshi.

The Sailor Senshi. The pale woman fashionably attired in a magnificent 
gown made up of different shades of pink silk, licked her lips. Her 
raspberry eyes seemed to smoulder as her fanning hastened somewhat. 
Thrinakie hadn&#39;t told her that they were such pretty girls... and that 
man who fought beside them wearing a cape...

Laodameia smiled lecherously. Another thing she liked about humans was 
the way their lovely bodies reacted to certain... stimuli; especially 
her own elegant human manifestation. It was different when Laodameia was 
in her true form; her body didn&#39;t feel, or react, in quite the same 
way...

The woman fanned a little faster. Laodameia didn&#39;t really need to kill 
*all* of the Sailor Senshi, or their male friend. No, she could keep 
one. Or perhaps two. She tapped a slender finger on her chin as she 
contemplated which one of this world&#146;s defenders would be spared her 
terrible wrath. The blonde one with the ribbon in her golden locks 
perhaps... yes, and that masked male too. Laodameia decided she would 
let the two of them keep their odd outfits; it would be more... 
entertaining that way.

With thoughts of her new plans in mind, the woman reached over to a 
small silver bell that sat beside her on the cushions and rang it 
gently. After the briefest of moments the double doors of her room 
opened and her youma assistant, Aiaia, walked in briskly. She was in her 
human form because Laodameia liked her youma to present themselves in 
that way when before her. Many of her youma worshipers had human figures 
quite pleasing to the eye.

&quot;Aiaia, I want you to send this request to all the youma under my 
command,&quot; Laodameia ordered as soon as her aide was a few feet in front 
of her.

&quot;As you wish, my Lady,&quot; Aiaia said in deference with her head bent low, 
her shoulder length brunette hair slightly hiding the light pink flush 
on her cheeks.

&quot;I want one of the Sailor Senshi captured *alive* and also that male who 
fights alongside them... you know, the one they call Tux-- something. I 
would much prefer it if the blonde senshi with straight hair were 
captured. And don&#39;t hurt them too much! It would not do if you 
permanently damaged their bodies...&quot; Laodameia licked her lips again as 
she imagined getting one of the Sailor Senshi and their male friend into 
her possession.

Aiaia raised her head and looked at her mistress, her mouth open as if 
she were going to say something.

Laodameia tapped her hand on her leg in impatience. &quot;Well? Get going!&quot; 
she commanded with annoyance, making a shooing motion with her fan.

The youma lowered her head again, her blush deepening. &quot;Y-Yes, my Lady,&quot; 
she stuttered. Aiaia stepped backwards several paces, bowing as she 
went, then quickly turned and strode from the room, closing the suite&#146;s 
doors behind her.

Laodameia ignored her servant&#146;s departure and relaxed back onto her 
cushions. She couldn&#39;t wait until her new pets arrived. Perhaps she 
should have told Aiaia to capture more of the Sailor Senshi. Was one 
going to be enough? She rather liked that cute one with the short blue 
hair too. Laodameia let out a small breath of air. She couldn&#146;t really 
decide. They were all just so exquisite!

Sanjuro yawned widely, making no effort to cover his mouth. He stretched 
his arms and slouched back into the chair in front of his desk in the 
newsroom of the Yokohama Daily. It had taken two full days of work, a 
level of effort that was indeed a rarity for him, but he had nearly 
finished his two-page spread on the masked fire woman. All he needed now 
was an exclusive interview with her, some pictures of her in action... 
and a heroic name. Sanjuro couldn&#39;t think of a decent name for the life 
of him. He was beginning to consider that maybe he should just rip one 
off from an anime series or something.

Sanjuro rubbed his bleary eyes, and then stuffed the remainder of his 
potato chips into his mouth. While he munched away, the reporter looked 
at his computer clock... it was nearly nine at night. Sanjuro had been 
at work entirely far too long today... but it had been worth it to get 
most of his feature done. His story was going to blow the editor&#146;s mind! 
The reporter scrunched up his chip packet and threw it into the bin 
beside his desk.

Sanjuro looked over at the only other person in the office; Tetsuya 
Arisawa. Sanjuro didn&#39;t know Tetsuya very well; the man hadn&#39;t been with 
The Daily that long. If he remembered right, the newcomer covered 
sports. Tetsuya seemed a little uptight to the spiky-haired man. He 
always came to work right on time and dressed immaculately in a suit and 
tie everyday. He was definitely not the kind of person a laid-back 
reporter like Sanjuro would get along well with. Tetsuya didn&#39;t usually 
work this late, though. But, come to think of it, Sanjuro did recall him 
working late into the previous evening, too. He guessed that Tetsuya 
must have been covering some big sporting special for the newspaper, or 
something similar. The reporter put thoughts of the stuffy Tetsuya out 
of his mind; he had worked long enough and it was time to go home.

Sanjuro shutdown his computer, packed his things into a shoulder bag, 
then switched off his desk lamp. Picking up his bag, he began to walk 
across the newsroom towards where the elevator was located. He hadn&#39;t 
gotten far before the phone on his desk rang. Sanjuro halted in his 
tracks and turned back towards his desk, frowning in annoyance. Who the 
hell would be calling the office this late at night?

Sanjuro simply stood there for a moment, wondering if he should just 
ignore the phone and go home already. He hadn&#146;t even eaten dinner yet! 
Well, unless you counted snack foods, which Sanjuro didn&#146;t. While he 
pondered whether or not to answer the call, he noticed Tetsuya watching 
him closely. Sanjuro swallowed somewhat uneasily under the rather 
intense scrutiny of his co-worker as the shrill rings of the phone 
continued to puncture the oppressive silence of the newsroom repeatedly. 
A silence the spiky-haired man hadn&#146;t even realised existed until now. A 
cold shiver went down the reporter&#146;s spine. He blinked, and then shook 
his head to clear it. Sometimes Tetsuya gave him the creeps.

Not wanting to look like a jerk in front of the new employee by ignoring 
the phone, Sanjuro reluctantly walked back to his desk. He felt his 
colleague&#146;s eyes follow him eerily all the while. When he reached his 
phone, he quickly picked up the receiver.

&quot;Sanjuro Watanabe, Yokohama Daily,&quot; he yawned out casually, though his 
eyes surreptitiously darted towards Tetsuya. He was still watching. Damn 
weirdo.

&quot;Sanjuro?&quot; questioned a girl&#39;s voice on the other end of the line.

&quot;That&#39;s what I said. What do you want?&quot; Sanjuro answered rudely; he was 
too tired for this. Plus Tetsuya was freaking him out and he was hungry. 
All he wanted to do was go home.

&quot;Umm... you don&#39;t know me, but we have a mutual... friend,&quot; the voice 
ventured tentatively, the last word being noticeably forced out.

&quot;Yeah? Well I have lots of friends,&quot; Sanjuro replied as he idly played 
with some paperclips on his desk.

The voice paused for a second, as if not believing his claim. &quot;I&#39;m sure 
you do, but this friend wears... a mask,&quot; the voice continued.

Sanjuro let his bag slip off of his shoulder and hit the floor. &quot;A 
mas...!&quot; he started loudly, but then hastily cupped the receiver 
slightly with his free hand, not wanting Tetsuya to overhear. &quot;A mask?&quot; 
Sanjuro questioned more quietly. &quot;You mean, you know... you know *her*?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and we need your help right now,&quot; the girl responded anxiously, 
while an unidentifiable someone in the background added, &quot;Yeah, like 
right the hell *now*!&quot; in a fretful, yet substantially muted cry.

&quot;Wicked!&quot; Sanjuro exclaimed elatedly. &quot;She needs my help? That is just 
so... wow! What does she want me to do? Does she want me to investigate 
something?&quot; the reporter went on, practically bursting with excitement.

&quot;No, nothing. We need a place to hide out,&quot; the girl explained.

&quot;Hide out?&quot; Sanjuro parroted, obviously a little confused.

&quot;Yes, damn it! We need somewhere to hole up for awhile and we want to 
use your place!&quot; the girl declared irritably, her patience lost.

&quot;Well, I... uh... I guess you and her can crash at my place...&quot; Sanjuro 
said uncertainly. &quot;Wait. There aren&#39;t any ugly monsters that shoot light 
out of their mouths involved in this, are there?&quot; he then asked 
apprehensively, the scary memories from his recent encounter with the 
paranormal coming back to him.

&quot;Monsters that shoot light out of their mouths? Uh... no, of course 
not,&quot; the girl reassured the somewhat rattled reporter. &quot;Can you hurry,&quot; 
the girl urged, &quot;we need to get to your place right away!&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Sanjuro relented, &quot;I&#39;ll pick you up, I guess, just give me the 
address.&quot; He copied the information down on a notepad near the phone, 
said his goodbyes, and then set the receiver back onto its cradle. After 
tearing off the page with the address the spiky-haired man grabbed his 
bag from the floor and strode briskly, yet calmly, towards the elevator 
around the corner. He could still feel Tetsuya&#146;s eyes on him, only this 
time, they were boring holes into his back.

Once out of sight, Sanjuro ran as fast as he could to the metal doors 
and pressed the button for the basement garage where his car was parked. 
The reporter had finally gotten his big break. Contact with the 
mysterious masked woman; it was just too perfect! With Sanjuro by the 
heroine&#39;s side, it should be a simple matter to snap the action photos 
of her he wanted. Acquiring consent for a one-on-one interview might 
take some convincing, though... but Sanjuro was pretty confident about 
his persuasion abilities. He grinned gleefully as he descended in the 
elevator. This story was going to make him reporter of the year!

******

Rei rested her head on the back seat of Sanjuro&#146;s car, the front 
passenger seat having been occupied by all sorts of junk ranging 
anywhere from old newspapers and crumpled food packaging, to rolls of 
film and floppy disks; all evidently belonging to Sanjuro. She exhaled 
heavily; she was exhausted. The miko rolled her head groggily to the 
left to look at Tsubasa who sat next to her in the rear of the vehicle. 
Her neighbour still seemed pretty shell-shocked. His brown eyes appeared 
somewhere between vacant and feverish as he stared straight ahead at the 
back of the front seat.

Rei smiled a little at the sight. It wasn&#39;t every day that your world 
was turned upside down. Being attacked by a monster and then being 
forced to flee because more of them were about to storm your apartment 
was certainly not a crisis one would expect to be faced with in normal 
everyday life. Rei turned away from Tsubasa and closed her eyes. She 
tried valiantly to block out Sanjuro&#39;s nagging voice that constantly 
asked where &#39;she&#39; was. Sanjuro certainly was annoying... but Rei doubted 
that the youma would be able to find her, or Tsubasa, while staying with 
him. The Fire Senshi opened her eyes several minutes later when Sanjuro 
brought her out of her musings with the announcement of their arrival.

Sanjuro lived on the second floor of a small motel-like apartment 
complex. Sanjuro&#39;s standard of living was the complete opposite of 
Tsubasa&#39;s and her own. So much so, that Rei first thought the youma had 
somehow figured out where she was heading and ransacked the place in 
search of their prey. But when Sanjuro reacted as if everything was all 
right, the miko realised with horrible clarity that the apartment was 
how it always was--a complete sty.

There were clothes just about *everywhere*. Rei thought she even spotted 
some underpants hanging off the ceiling fan in the main room, which also 
doubled as the bedroom and kitchen. Used takeout boxes littered the 
tables and the old newspapers that blanketed the floor nearly hid the 
dirty brown coloured carpet beneath totally from view.

Rei glanced through the half opened bathroom door near the entrance and 
sighted wet towels jammed into metal rails and more decorating the tiled 
floor. The kitchen looked like a cockroach&#39;s paradise. There were 
liberal scatterings of crumbs and other food particles all over the 
place... including the cracked tiled floor partition. There were also 
dirty dishes stacked high in the sink and on the counter tops. Rei shook 
her head in disgust. Gods, how could Sanjuro live like this?

&quot;Welcome to my humble abode!&quot; Sanjuro invited enthusiastically as the 
trio entered the reporter&#146;s home, two however clearly reluctant. If 
Tsubasa&#146;s sickly expression was anything to go by, it looked like he 
wanted to go back to his own apartment, monsters be damned.

Rei stood there in the doorway, not knowing what to say. &quot;It&#146;s... um... 
nice,&quot; she finally settled on.

Sanjuro grinned at what he perceived was a genuine complement and told 
his guests to make themselves at home.

Rei asked if she could use his bathroom, and after receiving a ready nod 
of consent, went in with her bedclothes and a bag of medical supplies 
she had taken with her from Tsubasa&#146;s apartment. She showered and 
treated all of her wounds properly, replacing the quick patch job she 
had done after the fight at Tsubasa&#146;s. She imagined the place was packed 
with ravenous youma by now. Rei prayed that the creatures wouldn&#146;t take 
their frustrations out on the other tenants in the apartment building 
after finding Tsubasa and her long gone.

After taking ages to find a clean, dry towel to use on herself, Rei 
dressed for bed and left the bathroom. When she went back into the main 
room of Sanjuro&#146;s apartment, the raven-haired girl saw that Tsubasa had 
cleared all of the rubbish off of the reporter&#146;s couch and was now 
sitting on it. She hadn&#146;t even noticed that there was, in fact, a couch 
underneath all of that trash earlier.

&quot;You can use the bathroom next,&quot; Rei informed Tsubasa as she noticed him 
examining the four blood encrusted scars across his bare chest by 
carefully prodding them with one finger.

Tsubasa looked up from his inspection and nodded his thanks to the miko. 
He then got up and went into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.

Seeing that the raven-haired girl had come out of his bathroom, Sanjuro 
walked over to speak to Rei. &quot;Umm, are you hungry? I don&#39;t have any food 
in the fridge that you&#39;d want to eat... but I could order a pizza if you 
want,&quot; Sanjuro said, his eyes occasionally darting to the bandages that 
visibly graced the girl&#39;s bare legs.

&quot;Well, if you would be so kind... but Tsubasa and I don&#39;t have much 
money,&quot; Rei replied courteously, while trying to ignore the reporter&#146;s 
scrutiny of her wounds. She hoped that he wouldn&#146;t put two and two 
together. The miko internally chastised herself for not wearing 
something that would have hidden all of the dressings.

Sanjuro held up a silencing hand. &quot;It&#39;s cool. This one&#146;s on me. You&#39;re a 
friend of a friend after all.&quot; He winked conspiratorially at Rei.

The Fire Senshi smiled at him in thanks and sat on the couch Tsubasa 
recently vacated to rest her sore, weary legs. While Sanjuro went to the 
phone and ordered dinner, Rei closed her eyes and thought back to what 
the shadow youma had told her... with some motivation. The youma were 
apparently coming through some sort of gate at a Wong Fei&#146;s--whatever 
that was--in Chinatown. It was obvious what Rei had to do. It looked 
like the Senshi of Fire would be heading to Chinatown in the morning....

Rei then wondered what she was supposed to tell the two men. She could 
probably spin some tall tale to dupe Sanjuro into believing that she 
wasn&#39;t the masked woman he had encountered at the warehouse; but Tsubasa 
had been physically attacked and injured by a youma, then subsequently 
witnessed Rei beat it up. Panicking when the monster escaped from her 
neighbour&#146;s apartment probably hadn&#39;t helped her cover much, either. 
Maybe she could just not bring it up and act as though nothing had 
happened. Rei pursed her lips. No, Tsubasa would ask questions for sure; 
he had just abandoned his home and most of his belongings. The miko 
sighed. Just what *was* she going to tell him?

Rei snapped out of her thoughts when Tsubasa emerged from the bathroom 
dressed in a t-shirt and sweatpants. She quickly avoided his gaze and 
focused instead on Sanjuro&#39;s television in front of the couch. Tsubasa 
gingerly sat next to Rei and merely watched the TV too, not saying a 
word. At the point when Rei began to find the silence between herself 
and Tsubasa uncomfortable, Sanjuro declared that he was going to take a 
shower and went into the bathroom.

&quot;The money for the pizza&#39;s on the kitchen counter!&quot; he called before 
shutting the door with a bang.

Once Sanjuro was out of the room Tsubasa turned to Rei, the question she 
dreaded most clear in his eyes. The miko knew what was coming, but hoped 
she would be wrong, nevertheless....

&quot;Megumi, what happened back in my apartment? You called that thing a 
&#39;youma&#39;. You seem to know a lot about what is going on and you can 
fight; I mean, you can *really* fight! You&#39;re right in the middle of all 
this somehow, aren&#146;t you?&quot; Tsubasa said.

Rei continued to stare at the television screen, though the images it 
displayed didn&#146;t register in her mind. &quot;It&#39;s... complicated,&quot; she began 
after several moments of internal struggling to find the right words, 
&quot;and it would probably be better if I didn&#39;t say anything... for you own 
safety.&quot; She sighed and paused to rub her temples, before resuming, 
&quot;Just know that there are some terrible things out there... things that 
come straight from your worst nightmares... but there are also a few 
good things too. There are good people who fight those terrible 
things... do you understand what I&#39;m saying?&quot;

Tsubasa stared at the Fire Senshi&#146;s profile for a few seconds while he 
absorbed what she had said. Then he nodded slowly. &quot;I think so. You&#39;re 
saying that you&#39;re... that you&#39;re one of those good people.&quot;

Rei nodded gravely, her lavender gaze still fixated on the television. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t tell you more but...&quot; she started to apologise, but 
was quickly interrupted by Tsubasa.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I understand. I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re on our side,&quot; he 
commented with a smirk.

Rei finally turned to look at her neighbour turned confidant and gave 
him a rakish half-smile. &quot;Hope I didn&#39;t scare you back there.&quot;

Tsubasa waved a hand in a dismissive gesture and grinned. &quot;Nah, a young 
girl beating the snot out of an invisible monster in my very own 
apartment? Pfft, I saw that last weekend!&quot;

The pizza soon arrived and Sanjuro came out of the bathroom just in time 
to chow down the most slices. By the time dinner was finished, it was 
late into the night. All three of them were really feeling the rigours 
of the day, though the specific events each had experienced were quite 
different. Regardless, Rei and the others decided to get some sleep. The 
two men graciously offered Rei the double bed, as they should, and she 
accepted it gratefully. Sanjuro took the couch, leaving Tsubasa to sleep 
on the floor.

While a hesitant Tsubasa arranged Sanjuro&#39;s spare blankets on the grubby 
floor, Rei sat on the bed and rummaged around in her bag for the picture 
of Usagi. The Fire Senshi found it wedged between some skirts and pulled 
it out. As she was taking a good long look at her love, she was suddenly 
filled with a painful longing.

Tsubasa noticed the girl&#39;s obvious expression of yearning. &quot;Who&#39;s that? 
Is that other girl your friend Usagi?&quot; he asked conversationally while 
he fluffed a pillow and sat beside her.

Rei was startled; she hadn&#39;t realised Tsubasa had been watching her. 
&quot;Yes... that&#39;s her,&quot; the miko responded in a quiet voice, still gazing 
at the framed photograph in her hands.

Tsubasa studied Rei&#39;s face and the deep sadness that darkened her 
lavender eyes. He was afraid to ask the next question, but did so 
anyway. &quot;Is she... is she still... with us?&quot; he asked carefully.

A small smile came to the Fire Senshi&#146;s lips. &quot;She&#39;d better be. I&#39;ll 
kill Setsuna if she isn&#39;t.&quot;

Tsubasa let out the breath he had been holding. He didn&#39;t bother asking 
who &#39;Setsuna&#39; was. &quot;Oh. Then why do you look so sad? Haven&#39;t you seen 
her in a while? Does she live far away, or something?&quot;

&quot;No.... she lives in Tokyo, but I haven&#39;t seen her for some time now,&quot; 
Rei answered softly. Nor will I likely ever see her again, she mentally 
added.

&quot;Tokyo? That isn&#39;t far. Why don&#39;t you go for a visit after all of this 
&#39;youma&#39; business is over and done with?&quot; Tsubasa suggested, still 
puzzled by why the miko looked so depressed.

Rei smiled forlornly, her expression falling even more if that were 
possible. &quot;It&#39;s not that simple,&quot; she explained sadly, &quot;I&#39;ll probably 
never see her again... except for in this picture... and in my 
dreams...&quot; she finished in a whisper, tenderly stroking the image of 
Usagi in the picture with her thumb.

Seeing that the raven-haired girl was becoming even more downcast, 
Tsubasa briefly considered dropping the whole subject; but his interest 
was piqued, so he decided to persist, instead. After all, he had just 
learned that Rei was some sort of fighter for justice. What could 
compare to that?

&quot;Did you have a falling out with her?&quot; he questioned.

&quot;No,&quot; Rei replied, tears beginning to form in her eyes, &quot;we were always 
arguing, but that wasn&#39;t why I left. It was... it was...&quot; More tears 
gathered in Rei&#39;s lavender eyes and were on the verge of spilling out to 
run down her cheeks.

Why was she talking to Tsubasa about this? He didn&#39;t need to know about 
her personal life; he probably didn&#39;t even really care... he was just 
curious. Rei and Tsubasa weren&#146;t that close; she had only known him for 
slightly over a week. He could almost be called a stranger. Just because 
they had been neighbours in the same apartment building, and sometimes 
had breakfast together, didn&#146;t mean that they were automatically good 
friends.

Tsubasa&#39;s prying just served to remind her of the one-sided love she 
held for Usagi. And it hurt so much. The pain was stronger than anything 
Rei had ever experienced mentally or physically. There was no willpower 
great enough to block it out, no attack powerful enough to defeat it. It 
was just pain, raw and true. Rei didn&#39;t know she carried such pain, such 
torment in her heart. All of the recent fighting had distracted her from 
feeling it. She had only been allowed to remember during the fleeting 
moments of peace when she was alone. But now all of the pent up misery 
she felt was resurfacing and pouring out unbidden... no matter who the 
audience was. Or perhaps the grief inside her heart was not coming out 
unbidden after all. Either way, it didn&#146;t matter; she had to let it 
out....

&quot;It was...?&quot; Tsubasa encouraged.

The trembling tears that brimmed in Rei&#146;s eyes finally fell and rolled 
down her cheeks, gathering in droplets at the bottom of her chin. &quot;It 
was... because of me,&quot; Rei began. &quot;You see, Usagi is the most 
courageous, compassionate person I know... m-my best friend...&quot; Her 
voice faltering a little, and she took a deep breath to help steady 
herself. &quot;I would have done anything for her, I still would... I would 
die for her without hesitation...&quot;

The miko smiled and looked up at nothing, her blurry eyes vacant as she 
stared inwardly at a beautiful vision only she could see. &quot;She is the 
most gorgeous, divine creature on this earth....&quot; she whispered, before 
her gaze fell back down to the picture still clutched in her hands. &quot;I-I 
love her so much that it hurts; but I would rather have this pain than 
feel nothing for her.&quot;

Rei paused then, her face frozen in an expression of deep sorrow. 
&quot;But...&quot; she continued after a moment, her voice thick, &quot;but Usagi 
doesn&#39;t love me like I love her. She has someone else. The love of *her* 
life, her true love... her soul mate... her prince... her... 
destiny....&quot;

Rei swallowed hard as the last word she spoke rang through her, then 
whatever semblance of control she&#39;d had over her heartache, suddenly 
failed. She pressed a hand over her face as she started to sob, her 
heaving body wracked with grief.

Tsubasa didn&#39;t know what to do as Rei broke down. He felt like such an 
insensitive idiot for pushing the girl. Tsubasa awkwardly put an arm 
around Rei&#39;s shoulders to offer some comfort.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have pressured you... but, you know, maybe 
you&#39;ll find someone else,&quot; he offered as reassuringly as he could 
manage.

Rei continued to weep uncontrollably, her tears running through her 
fingers and down the back of her hand. She shook her head. &quot;N-No, there 
will never be anyone e-else. Usagi was the *only* one... *is* the only 
one... my only love. Don&#39;t you understand? She&#39;s the *one*. I thought 
that I could just forget her, or at least put her behind me, and let her 
live her life. But I can&#39;t. I don&#39;t think I ever will forget Usagi... I 
will love her forever....&quot;

As Rei shared those last four words; she knew them to be true. Rei would 
never resent Usagi for not loving her the way she desired. She could 
never ever hate her princess for it, either. Hers was a love that was 
inextinguishable; it would burn strongly in her heart. Forever.

Tsubasa looked desperately to Sanjuro for help, but the coward was lying 
on the couch with his eyes closed, pretending to be asleep. Tsubasa 
looked back at the distraught girl, frantically searching for words to 
console her with. But he had no words that would give comfort to Rei; no 
advice that he could give. Sometimes things were just plain bad and 
there was nothing one could do but simply endure it. It was one of those 
harsh truths about life.

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know what to tell you,&quot; he admitted quietly after a few 
seconds.

&quot;G-Gods... how can I go on like this? I can&#39;t take this *every* *single* 
*day* for the rest of my life. Without her, life is so... it&#39;s just too 
much... th-there&#39;s nothing left for me now....&quot; Rei snivelled, her tone 
filled with hopelessness.

&quot;There *is* something left. You mentioned that you were a fighter on the 
side of good,&quot; Tsubasa argued, not caring if Sanjuro was listening. &quot;You 
have that. You have people who rely on you to help them, to defend them. 
Where would I be without you? I would have been killed!&quot;

Rei shook her head vehemently, her tears continuing to fall as she 
contradicted him, &quot;No, Tsubasa. If I hadn&#39;t been there, the attack on 
y-you wouldn&#39;t have happened in the f-first place.&quot; Then a depressing 
comprehension dawned on her like a heavy shroud, the weight of its 
mantle making her shoulders slump even more. She was a senshi. Her voice 
took on an edge as she acquiesced, &quot;You&#39;re right, Tsubasa, I am a 
fighter. It&#39;s all I have left now. I&#39;ll fight, and keep fighting, until 
there is nothing evil left in this world... or until I&#39;m finally granted 
death. I have nothing left to lose....&quot; she declared.

Tsubasa didn&#39;t like the sound of that.

Rei dropped the hand from her face, took a deep, shuddering breath, and 
then let it out slowly. She wiped the tears from her face and blew her 
nose on the tissue Tsubasa handed her.

Tsubasa looked into Rei&#146;s red, bloodshot eyes. They weren&#39;t sad 
anymore... they were dull and lifeless; resigned. It was as though the 
death she had wished to be granted had already laid waste to her on the 
inside, leaving behind a mere shell that lacked a beating heart or a 
vibrant soul. It was an unnerving sight.

&quot;I&#39;m going to sleep now,&quot; Rei stated, as if nothing had happened. 
Ignoring Tsubasa, she then climbed under the bed covers and closed her 
eyes. She never let go of the photo of Usagi.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

Well, I was actually going to write more but I didn&#39;t have the time. 
Besides, this seemed like an okay place to stop. There aren&#39;t many 
chapters left in this Yokohama story arc. As before, I hope the 
angsty-mushy scene wasn&#39;t too cheesy.</pre>
