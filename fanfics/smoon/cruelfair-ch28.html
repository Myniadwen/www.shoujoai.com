<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 28 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>	The bristles of the broom scraped lightly along the path, playing 
chase with an errant piece of paper.  Minako laughed quietly at her 
little game as the broom finally captured the paper and brushed it off 
to the side with the other debris.
	It was a warm Thursday evening, and Minako was enjoying being 
outside, even though she&#146;d been left to finish the remainder of the 
light work to close up the shrine.  Leaning against her broom, she let 
out a sigh and surveyed the front yard.  It looked pretty good, if she 
did say so herself, and this was a nice change of pace from the 
hecticness of work and school that followed her around during the week.  
Not that she was complaining about any of it.  She was having too much 
fun to do that.
	&#147;Hey now, no slacking off,&#148; came Rei&#146;s chiding voice from behind 
her.
	Minako stood straight and turned around, a smirk on her features.  
&#147;I could say the same to you.  You do know you have to use soap when 
you wash the dishes, right?&#148;
	&#147;Ha!  Those dishes are so clean they squeak,&#148; returned Rei with a 
smug grin.  She hefted the bag that was over her shoulder up a bit 
higher and added, &#147;They&#146;re drying.  I&#146;ll put them away when I get back 
from Ami and Mako-chan&#146;s.&#148;
	Minako nodded, then asked, &#147;What&#146;s in the bag?&#148;
	Rei reached into her bag and pulled out a small oil burner and 
one of the little scented oil bottles they sold at the charm booth.  
&#147;Those classes we went to were all well and good, and they&#146;ve got the 
right idea with the breathing and visualization, but their way is more 
likely to have Mako-chan hyperventilating than anything else.  So, now, 
I&#146;m going to teach her how to do it the right way.&#148;
	With a smile, Minako teased, &#147;How good of you to do that for 
her.&#148;
	Rei nodded.  &#147;Yes, it is.  Besides, I&#146;m hoping it&#146;ll work as a 
good distraction, since Ami said Mako-chan&#146;s been cranky as hell all 
afternoon.  Well, she didn&#146;t exactly use those words, but that&#146;s what 
she wanted to say.  But she did say Mako-chan has decided that if she 
has one more contraction that isn&#146;t actual labor between now and when 
she delivers, she&#146;s going to kill someone.&#148;
	&#147;Poor Mako-chan,&#148; sympathized Minako with a chuckle.
	&#147;More like poor Ami,&#148; replied Rei.  &#147;If I didn&#146;t know her better, 
I&#146;d swear this whole &#145;research&#146; thing she has to do tonight is just an 
excuse to get away for a few hours.&#148;  Rei laughed and shook her head.  
&#147;But whatever the reason, it&#146;ll be one more thing she can cross off her 
list.  And I need to get going.  I&#146;ll see you in a few hours,&#148; she said 
as she stepped up to Minako and kissed her lips lightly.
	Minako waved as Rei walked away and disappeared down the stairs.  
As she finished cleaning up, she wondered how late Artemis would be out 
tonight.  He&#146;d seemed in an awful hurry when he&#146;d left after dinner.  
Her smile growing, Minako murmured to herself, &#147;I guess even those two 
can&#146;t fight their destinies.&#148;
	The tap of footsteps on stone caught Minako&#146;s attention, and she 
turned around with a teasing grin on her face, ready to poke at Rei 
about whatever she&#146;d forgotten.  The grin faded quickly, however, when 
she saw the man standing there.  Her hands gripping the broom handle 
tightly, she said in quiet surprise, &#147;Daddy?&#148;
	&#147;Minako,&#148; he said by way of greeting.  He cleared his throat 
nervously and stuck his hands in the pockets of his slacks.  &#147;How have 
you been?&#148;
	&#147;Okay,&#148; she answered faintly.  For a moment, her feet fidgeted, 
then she said more clearly, &#147;I&#146;ve been okay.  Everything&#146;s been going 
pretty well.&#148;
	&#147;Good, good,&#148; her father replied, nodding his head.  &#147;I&#146;m glad to 
hear that.  You&#146;re still going to school?&#148;
	&#147;Yes, sir.&#148;
	&#147;Good.  That&#146;s an important thing.&#148;  He took a breath.  &#147;So... 
yes.  Well&#133;&#148;
	&#147;I got a new job, too,&#148; blurted Minako quickly.  Her fingers 
twisted around the broom handle as she continued to speak at a rapid 
pace.  &#147;It&#146;s at a production company, but I don&#146;t really do much other 
than copying stuff, and getting coffee, and I follow Colleen around a 
lot and help her with stuff.  Oh, and Tuesday I stayed late and got 
sandwiches for the last minute meeting that was going on.  But that&#146;s 
what I&#146;m supposed to do, so it wasn&#146;t really a big deal, and if I stay 
late sometimes I leave early the next night, so it all evens out.  And 
my boss-boss is pretty nice, even if he can&#146;t remember my name and 
calls me &#145;New Girl&#146; all the time.  Colleen&#146;s great, you&#146;d probably like 
her.  She&#146;s American, but her stepdad is Japanese, and she&#146;s lived here 
since she was seven, so she&#146;s really more Japanese than American, and 
my English is better than hers.&#148;  Minako took a deep breath.  Her mouth 
opened to continue, but slowly closed again.  There was so much she 
wanted to say, but she didn&#146;t want to say the wrong thing, and there 
was so much that could be the wrong thing.
	The elder Aino listened and tried to keep up with his daughter as 
she spoke.  When she paused, he could feel an awkwardness settling over 
them.  He sighed and let his eyes close, letting the words fall from 
his lips before he had a chance to second guess them.  &#147;I&#146;m glad you&#146;re 
happy, Minako.  Really I am.  Adult or not, you&#146;re still my child, and 
I was concerned about you.&#148;  His eyes opened again, and he looked 
directly at her.  &#147;But just because I love you doesn&#146;t mean I&#146;ll sit 
back and pretend to approve of all of what you&#146;re doing.  I do want you 
to have a good life, though, and I&#133;&#148;  He faltered for a moment, his 
hands balling into fists in his pockets.  He cleared his throat and 
looked down at his feet as the words rushed out.  &#147;I would like to know 
that you&#146;re okay, and also when you&#146;re not.  So if you would tell me 
from time to time, I would appreciate it.  Though, if you need to call 
me, it would be best if you did at the office.  We both know how your 
mother is, and regardless of what she may be feeling&#133;  Well, she just 
doesn&#146;t forgive easily.&#148;
	Minako stared at her father through tears that were beginning to 
well up in her eyes.  &#147;Daddy, I&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Do you still have your key?&#148;
	The question was sudden and brought her father&#146;s nervous eyes 
back up to hers.  Minako hesitated, the question clear on her face.  
&#147;My house key?&#148;  At her father&#146;s nod, she went on, &#147;Yes, I still have 
it.  I suppose you want it back?&#148;
	&#147;No,&#148; he answered with a shake of his head.  &#147;I just wanted to 
make sure you still had it.  I&#146;m taking your mother out of town next 
weekend, and I thought you&#146;d like to come by and pick up anything you 
might&#146;ve left behind.  I know you couldn&#146;t have brought everything 
you&#146;d want with you.  And it&#146;s all still in the awful state you left it 
in.&#148;
	&#147;Um, yeah, I did leave some stuff,&#148; answered Minako.  &#147;Thank you.  
And, um, I&#146;m sorry about the mess.&#148;
	They stood in silence for several seconds, neither exactly sure 
what to do or say.  Then, without any warning, Minako&#146;s father stepped 
forward and put his arms around her.  Minako stood against him, too 
shocked to move, as his arms tightened and then released her.  He took 
several steps further back than before and spoke hurriedly.
	&#147;I have to leave,&#148; he said as he began to turn away.  &#147;Your 
mother&#146;s expecting me, and I don&#146;t want to be too late.&#148;
	As he walked quickly away from the shrine, Minako could only 
stare after him, her hands never loosening their grip on the broom.


	When Rei got home a few hours later, she was greeted by her 
grandfather with the news of their earlier visitor.  Worried and more 
than a little angry and annoyed, Rei hurried around to her room, where 
she found Minako sitting on the porch outside.
	Quietly, Rei sat beside her and stared up at the same stars 
Minako&#146;s gaze was fixed on.  &#147;Hey,&#148; she said softly.  &#147;How are you 
doing?&#148;
	Minako looked down at her hands and the keychain she was holding.  
&#147;My dad came to see me.&#148;
	&#147;I heard,&#148; answered Rei.  She put her arm around Minako&#146;s 
shoulders and the blonde rested her head against her.  &#147;What did he 
say?&#148;
	Minako grinned a little.  &#147;That he was worried about me and 
wanted to how I was.  And that he still loves me.&#148;
	Rei stiffened and had to force herself not to say the first 
things that popped into her mind.
	Feeling Rei&#146;s reaction, Minako set aside the keys and took Rei&#146;s 
hand.  She played with her fingers as she said, &#147;I know how you feel 
about this, Rei, but please just let me have it.  I didn&#146;t think he&#146;d 
ever speak to me again, and my mom probably won&#146;t.  He&#146;ll never approve 
of me, but he doesn&#146;t hate me either.  And I don&#146;t think he&#146;ll be angry 
forever.  That&#146;s all I want right now.&#148;
	Rei took a deep breath and nodded her head.  &#147;I know, Mina, and 
I&#146;m glad you&#146;ve got at least that.&#148;
	 Minako gave Rei&#146;s hand a squeeze in thanks, and then she asked, 
&#147;So, how was Mako-chan?&#148;
	With a smirk, Rei answered, &#147;Pretty much exactly as Ami 
described.  She&#146;s ready for this to be over.  As if the next 20 years 
are going to be any easier.&#148;
	Minako smiled and snuggled closer to Rei&#146;s side.  For a while 
longer, they sat and talked, enjoying the warmth of each other and the 
clear night.


*            *            *

	The sound of pens scratching against test papers was the dominant 
one in the classroom.  Every now and then, it would be offset by a foot 
scuffling or a chair creaking as one of the students shifted.  Yukiko 
was used to these sounds and could easily ignore them as she graded the 
homework assignments her students had handed in that day.  What she was 
having a hard time ignoring, and what was making her crazy in the 
process, was the silent, almost constant fidgeting coming from what had 
once been her calmest, most focused pupil.
	Yukiko let out a sigh and turned over another paper.  When Kino 
had left, she had been so relieved she hadn&#146;t even minded Keiko&#146;s 
giggles at her expense.  The girl was gone and could now give birth 
properly in an elevator or taxi cab rather than in her classroom.  
Because of that, Yukiko had walked into school last Monday completely 
relaxed for the first time since the start of the trimester.
	Then Mizuno had happened.
	Every midmorning and afternoon, Mizuno had taken to checking up 
on her girlfriend.  Keiko thought it was sweet and cute.  Yukiko 
figured she would have also if the afternoon call hadn&#146;t wound up 
during the break in the double period she had with Mizuno&#146;s class.  The 
girl almost seemed to expect something to be wrong when she called 
home, and her bearing near the end of their first period would reflect 
that.  Then, after she&#146;d made her call and assured herself all was 
well, the relief she felt was palpable and showed in the small smile 
she wore for the rest of class.  Those swings in her behavior were 
making Yukiko jumpy as hell.  Especially today, because when she&#146;d come 
back to class, Mizuno hadn&#146;t been smiling.
	Yukiko&#146;s foot tapped anxiously against her chair as her 
peripheral vision picked up Mizuno&#146;s movements.  The girl looked up 
from her test to the clock on the side wall.  She started chewing on 
her lip as she looked back down.  Her pen jittered nervously in her 
fingers as she looked back up and down again, as if more than 20 
seconds had passed.  She sat up straighter and stared at her paper for 
a full 30 seconds before her pen went into her mouth and she looked 
back up at the clock.
	Without conscious effort, the red pen Yukiko was using wound up 
between her teeth and she bit down hard.  A foul, metallic taste filled 
her mouth and she grimaced, cursing silently.  Her pen fell to her desk 
as she barked out, &#147;Mizuno!&#148;
	Every head in the room immediately snapped up.  Ami sat frozen in 
her seat, her eyes wide as she stared at her teacher.  Finally, she 
managed to stutter out, &#147;Yes, Kume-sensei?&#148;
	After a deep, calming breath, Yukiko asked, &#147;Are you done with 
your test?&#148;
	Ami swallowed hard.  &#147;Yes.&#148;
	&#147;Are all of the questions answered fully to your satisfaction?&#148;
	&#147;Yes, sensei.&#148;
	&#147;Then would you bring it up here, please?&#148;
	Ami nodded and rose slowly from her seat.  She tried to ignore 
the stares of the other students and the embarrassed flush she felt in 
her cheeks.
	As Ami stopped in front of her desk, Yukiko looked around her and 
glared at the others who were still watching them.  &#147;Since everyone&#146;s 
stopped writing, I&#146;m going to assume the rest of you are done also.&#148;
	Every set of eyes snapped back down to their tests.  All except 
for one.  Yuu kept his head down and his pen against his paper, but his 
focus was on Mizuno&#146;s back and the quiet conversation going on in front 
of him.
	Yukiko focused back on the girl in front of her and the papers 
she was being handed.  Taking them, she leaned forward and gestured for 
Ami to do the same.  Ami looked a bit puzzled by this, but did as 
requested and leaned in over the desk.
	With her chin propped in her palm, Yukiko asked quietly, &#147;You 
couldn&#146;t get a hold of her, right?&#148;
	Ami&#146;s cheeks flushed a brighter pink and her eyes fell to some 
spot on the desktop.  &#147;No, sensei,&#148; she answered in an equally quiet 
tone.
	Yukiko nodded slightly.  &#147;And it&#146;s making you a little nuts, 
isn&#146;t it?&#148;
	Ami shifted uncomfortably.  &#147;I&#146;m sorry.  I didn&#146;t mean to be 
disruptive.  It&#146;s just, she isn&#146;t by herself, and it&#146;s odd that no one 
answered the phone.  I&#146;m sorry.&#148;
	Lifting her head so she could wave her hand dismissively, Yukiko 
answered, &#147;Don&#146;t look so concerned about it, Mizuno.  Are you sure 
you&#146;re done with this?&#148;
	Ami nodded at the papers her teacher held up.
	&#147;Then go,&#148; said Yukiko.  &#147;Class is almost over, so make your call 
and reassure yourself.  Then come back and reassure me.&#148;
	Ami looked up and smiled thankfully at her teacher.  &#147;Thank you,&#148; 
she said.
	Yukiko waved her off and sat back in her chair.  She slumped down 
a bit and let out another sigh as Mizuno retrieved her cell phone and 
hurried out of the room.  Yukiko didn&#146;t know how much longer she had 
until Kino delivered.   Keiko refused to tell her no matter how she 
tried to wheedle the information from her.  She just hoped it was soon, 
because she didn&#146;t think she could handle too many more missed phone 
calls.


	As had become her recent habit, Ami walked to the side door 
closest to her classroom.  Once outside, she pushed the speed dial 
button that would connect her to Makoto and held her phone to her ear, 
a concentrated frown appearing on her face as she listened to it ring.
	On the fourth ring, Makoto picked up.  &#147;Hey, sweetheart,&#148; she 
said.  Then, knowing she&#146;d missed their regular call and that this 
would have worried Ami, added, &#147;I&#146;m sorry I missed you last time.  I 
swear I&#146;m okay, though, and that everything&#146;s fine.&#148;
	Ami let out a relieved breath at hearing Makoto&#146;s voice.  Just 
for a moment &#150; well, perhaps more than just one &#150; she&#146;d been certain 
something had gone wrong.  &#147;I&#146;m glad you&#146;re okay,&#148; she said calmly and 
honestly.  &#147;It&#146;s unusual that no one would answer when I call, though.  
My imagination was beginning to conjure all sorts of terrible 
scenarios.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m sorry.  Really I am,&#148; answered Makoto, sounding contrite.  
Then, with a smile creeping into her voice, &#147;I&#146;d ask what sort of 
scenarios you were conjuring, but I&#146;m more curious about why you&#146;re 
calling me and not taking your AP test.&#148;
	Ami grinned a bit self-consciously as she answered, &#147;I was being 
more outwardly nervous than I realized after I finished the test.  
Rather than checking my answers, I&#146;m afraid I was making Kume-sensei as 
jumpy as I was.  She kicked me out and told me to do what I needed to 
do to calm myself before coming back to class to reassure her there was 
nothing to be jumpy about.&#148;
	Makoto chuckled, pretty certain that if Ami had really been in 
trouble with the teacher, they wouldn&#146;t be speaking to each other right 
now.  &#147;First I get you in trouble with your mother, and now I&#146;ve gotten 
you kicked out of class.  I think I&#146;ve been a bad influence.&#148;
	&#147;Of course you have,&#148; answered Ami matter-of-factly, but with a 
smile.  &#147;That&#146;s why I like you so much.&#148;  She listened to Makoto laugh 
at that, and then said, &#147;Now it&#146;s your turn.  What were all of you 
doing when I called?&#148;
	&#147;We went for a walk,&#148; answered Makoto.  She shifted, and Ami 
heard the chair creak at the same time the school bell rang behind her.  
&#147;Bug&#146;s in a bad position or something,&#148; went on Makoto.  &#147;I thought 
maybe if I walked around for a bit, I could jostle him enough to get 
this backache to go away.  So, we went around the block.  Only it took 
longer than I remember it taking, and when we got back, the message 
light on the machine was blinking.&#148;
	&#147;Did it help at all,&#148; asked Ami, that niggle of concern sneaking 
back in.  &#147;And don&#146;t tell me it did if it didn&#146;t, because I&#146;ll know 
you&#146;re lying and worry even more.&#148;
	&#147;It helped,&#148; answered Makoto with no hesitation.  &#147;I think part 
of the problem was me sitting in one spot for too long and not moving 
anything but my toes.  Luna and Artemis tried really hard to talk me 
out of going, though.  You&#146;d have been proud.&#148;
	Ami smiled, a quiet laugh escaping.  &#147;I&#146;m sure.  What are you 
doing now?&#148;
	&#147;Right now, I&#146;m sitting here in my nightshirt and trying to 
decide what level of laziness I&#146;m going to achieve.  General Laziness,&#148; 
listed Makoto, and Ami was certain she was using her fingers to count 
off as she talked, &#147;which is me crashing in bed with a book until you 
get home.  Super Laziness, which includes the rest of the mint chip in 
the freezer, the TV remote, and me crashing in bed until you get home.  
Or Super Duper Laziness, which includes all of the above plus a nice 
soak in a moderately hot tub.&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re going to pick number three,&#148; said Ami sagely.
	&#147;Good guess,&#148; replied Makoto with a laugh.  &#147;And I guess, now 
that that&#146;s been settled, I should say goodbye and give you back to 
your teachers.&#148;
	&#147;I suppose,&#148; answered Ami, nodding her head.
	&#147;I love you, sweetie.  And don&#146;t worry about me so much.  I&#146;m 
fine.&#148;
	&#147;I know,&#148; said Ami, a warm smile spreading on her face.  &#147;I&#146;ll 
see you when I get home.  I&#133;&#148;
	She had started to turn towards the door, preparing to end her 
call the way she always did.  Instead, she froze midsentence as her 
eyes locked on to those of the boy standing at the top of the steps.  
She hadn&#146;t heard him come out at all, didn&#146;t have any idea how long 
he&#146;d been there watching and listening.  Her heart sped up as her eyes 
held on to Yuu&#146;s, and quietly, her voice steady and firm, she said to 
Makoto, &#147;I love you, too.&#148;
	Neither one of them blinked.  Ami&#146;s call ended, and she turned 
off her phone without ever once looking down or away.  Yuu didn&#146;t 
frown, or smile, or give any reaction at all to Ami&#146;s precise 
movements.  His face remained expressionless even as the smile Ami had 
worn swiftly turned to a line that wasn&#146;t quite a frown.  They stood 
like that for several long moments, neither moving or speaking, only 
staring at each other.
	She wasn&#146;t sure how much time had passed when Yuu broke eye 
contact by turning away from her.  His movements were easy and casual, 
one hand resting in his pocket as the other opened the door, as if he 
hadn&#146;t just stood there and pinned her with one of the most eerily 
intense stares she&#146;d ever been subjected to.  Ami blinked a few times, 
not at all able to interpret what had just happened or what she had 
seen in those brown eyes.  The whole thing had just been&#133; odd.
	Out of time, and not really wanting to think about it anymore, 
Ami walked back inside.  All she wanted now was to finish the day and 
go back home.


*            *            *

	Back in her nightshirt after a long soak in the tub, and with a 
pair of thick, fuzzy socks on her feet to keep her toes warm, Makoto 
was lying in bed when Ami came home.  Luna and Artemis heard the girl&#146;s 
footsteps before Makoto did, and Artemis lifted his head and blinked 
sleepily over Makoto&#146;s side as the bedroom door was opened.  Luna was 
already standing and stretching in the V formed by Makoto&#146;s knees when 
Ami walked in.
	&#147;You all look rather comfortable,&#148; said Ami softly as she sat on 
the edge of the bed closest to Makoto.
	&#147;We are,&#148; answered Makoto with a lazy grin.  &#147;You should join us 
for a while.  We&#146;ve got a few hours before Usagi gets here.&#148;
	Ami smiled at her and ran a finger lightly over the arm that held 
one pillow to Makoto&#146;s chest.  &#147;That sounds like a good offer.  Let me 
take care of one thing first, and then I&#146;ll come back.  It won&#146;t take 
long.&#148;
	Makoto nodded, then reached for the hand against her arm and held 
it briefly to her lips.  &#147;Okay,&#148; she answered as her fingers played 
with Ami&#146;s.
	Artemis, realizing he was going to be moved sooner rather than 
later, stood from his spot against Makoto&#146;s back and meandered down to 
the end of the bed.  He picked a new spot against the front of Makoto&#146;s 
legs and lay down next to Luna as Ami stood to leave.
	Sometime later, after the four of them had resettled and were 
lying comfortably in the dim, early evening light, they heard the front 
door open.  Usagi&#146;s voice drifted into the room, announcing her arrival 
with Chibi-usa.  The cats were the first up, and they jumped down from 
the foot of the bed to go and greet the newcomers.
	Ami&#146;s hand was warm against Makoto&#146;s back, and when its gentle 
movement didn&#146;t stop, Makoto sighed just a bit wistfully.  A half-smirk 
forming, she said, &#147;I suppose we should get up now.  So you aren&#146;t late 
for class.  Not to mention it would be pretty rude to just ignore our 
guests.&#148;
	&#147;Mmm,&#148; murmured Ami from behind Makoto, and without even having 
to look, Makoto knew a contemplative frown had appeared.   Then Ami 
said, &#147;Perhaps I should stay home tonight.&#148;
	&#147;Will you keep rubbing my back?&#148; joked Makoto.
	Her tone sincere, Ami answered, &#147;If that&#146;s what you want.&#148;
	Makoto shook her head and maneuvered onto her back so she could 
see Ami.  &#147;I was kidding,&#148; she said with a kind smile.  &#147;I don&#146;t want 
you missing school just because I have a few aches.  And as much as I 
would like to keep you here all to myself, what I want is for you to go 
to class and learn all sorts of really important stuff.  That way, you 
can get into the best med school on the planet, become a world famous 
doctor, and have everyone adore you as much as I do because you cured 
all sorts of terrible things like runny noses and chicken pox.&#148;
	A soft grin formed on Ami&#146;s lips, and she nodded slowly.  &#147;All 
right.  I suppose everything will be okay here, with Chibi-usa around 
to keep all of you in line.&#148;
	Makoto huffed in amusement.  Then, as she moved to sit up on the 
side of the bed, she grimaced and said, &#147;Well, things will be okay.  
Once I get this task with Usagi over and done with.  I can&#146;t believe 
I&#146;m about to do this after all the times I swore I never would.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s grin widened, and she answered, &#147;It&#146;s not all that bad a 
thing, Mako-chan.  And you still refused to use the canned icing, so it 
isn&#146;t a complete compromise of your values.&#148;  The grin she wore turned 
to giggles at the affronted look Makoto shot her.
	&#147;I&#146;m glad you find this so amusing,&#148; returned Makoto, her glare 
only half serious.  &#147;Just remember you think this isn&#146;t *so bad* the 
next time you want chocolate and I pull out another box of cake mix 
instead of the real thing.&#148;


	Rei stood outside her bedroom door, rattling the car keys she&#146;d 
just retrieved.  The downside to Minako&#146;s new job, she lamented 
silently, was the amount of time it took away from other things.  
Things like the date they&#146;d had planned for Saturday night.  However, 
her boss, bless his yen-pinching heart, preferred to give Minako her 
time back rather than pay her overtime.  So Saturday&#146;s date was 
rescheduled to tonight.
	Rei tossed the keys up and caught them in a tight grip.  &#147;We&#146;re 
going to be late!&#148; she called through the closed door.
	&#147;It doesn&#146;t start till 7:30,&#148; came back an unhurried reply.
	She pursed her lips and tried again, shooting back, &#147;We won&#146;t get 
good seats!&#148;
	Minako opened the door and stepped out onto the porch.  &#147;It&#146;s 
Monday night, Rei.  No one goes to the movies on Monday night.&#148;
	&#147;We do,&#148; smirked Rei.
	Minako grinned and looped her arm through Rei&#146;s.  &#147;We&#146;re 
special.&#148;


	Hotaru hurried ahead of Haruka, the small bag from the camera 
shop held tightly in one of her hands.  They had to pass the bakery on 
the way back to the car, and her papa had promised they&#146;d stop in 
before they left for home.  All of their after dinner errands were done 
now, and Hotaru knew just what she wanted to take home for everyone&#146;s 
dessert.
	A few steps ahead of Haruka, Hotaru stopped on the sidewalk 
outside the bakery window to wait for her.  The cheese cake was sitting 
on display, a layer of cherries decorated with puffs of whipped cream 
covering its top.  Hotaru licked her lips in anticipation.
	A moment later, Haruka came up behind her.  Smiling over her 
daughter&#146;s head, she asked, &#147;Are you sure that&#146;s what we should get?&#148;
	Hotaru nodded enthusiastically.
	&#147;All right.  Let&#146;s go,&#148; she said.  With Hotaru beside her, Haruka 
opened the door, and the scent of baking chocolate and other sweet 
things wafted over them as they went inside.


	She could hear Usagi over at the counter quietly counting the 
number of strokes as she stirred the chocolaty mixture in her bowl.  
Beside her at the table, Chibi-usa carefully held the bottle of red 
food coloring over the icing she had mixed up and very slowly squeezed 
out the number of drops she&#146;d been told would make pink.  Makoto 
grinned and finished placing the paper cups in the second cupcake pan.  
This actually hadn&#146;t been so bad, after all.
	&#147;Okay, Mako-chan, I&#146;m done,&#148; called Usagi.
	&#147;All right, next step,&#148; answered Makoto.  She stood slowly, her 
movements awkward as she found her balance.  Picking up the two cupcake 
pans, she walked the few feet to Usagi and set them on the counter.  
&#147;Fill each one evenly, up to here,&#148; she instructed.  &#147;The pre-heat 
light&#146;s off, so after you do that, put them in the oven.  Don&#146;t forget 
to set the timer.  And then, when they&#146;re done, while we wait for them 
to cool, whatever&#146;s left over in the bowl is ours.&#148;
	Usagi mirrored the grin her tutor was wearing and followed her 
instructions.
	&#147;Hey, Mako-chan,&#148; said Chibi-usa.  She pushed aside the bowl she 
was done with and looked over at the older girl as she asked, &#147;Can we 
spend the night tonight?&#148;
	Makoto leaned back against the counter and smiled at the girl.  
&#147;But it&#146;s a school night.  No sleepovers on school night&#146;s, I&#146;m 
afraid.&#148;
	&#147;You don&#146;t have to go to school, though,&#148; returned Chibi-usa.  
&#147;It won&#146;t hurt if we miss one day so someone can stay here with you.&#148;
	&#147;Luna and Artemis will be here,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;I think I can 
make do with them.&#148;
	&#147;Please, Mako-chan.  We could give them the day off,&#148; continued 
the little girl.
	Usagi, after closing the oven door, decided to insert herself 
into the conversation by walking over to Chibi-usa and whapping her on 
the head with a potholder.  &#147;Don&#146;t be a pest.  She already told you 
no.&#148;
	Chibi-usa cringed under the assault, then shot Usagi an indignant 
glare.  Standing on her chair so they were eye to eye, she said, &#147;I 
know what she said.  But I want to stay, so I asked again.  That 
doesn&#146;t mean I was being a pest, and it doesn&#146;t mean you have to hit me 
for it.&#148;
	Usagi waved the potholder dismissively.  &#147;That was hardly a hit.  
Besides, you were being a pest.&#148;  She waved the potholder over in 
Makoto&#146;s direction.  &#147;See, look, she&#146;s in pain just from having to 
list&#133; en&#133;  Um&#133; Mako-chan?  Are you okay?&#148;
	Usagi&#146;s voice quieted quickly as her eyes widened in surprise and 
concern.  Makoto&#146;s eyes were squeezed shut and her lips were pressed 
into a pale, thin line.  One of her hands gripped the edge of the 
counter to the point her knuckles were turning white, while the other 
arm held her middle.  The small whimper that escaped as she tried to 
suck in a breath pushed Usagi passed her initial second of confused 
panic, and the blonde hurried to her friend&#146;s side.
	She knew Usagi was beside her, and that it was her hands on her 
shoulder and stroking her arm.  Makoto also knew what was happening, 
regardless of the fact that she&#146;d been told just two days ago that she 
wouldn&#146;t deliver for at least another week.  She was shaking her head, 
some part of her still trying to deny it, even as the words passed her 
lips.  &#147;That was a real one.&#148;
	&#147;A real what?&#148; questioned Usagi uncertainly, not quite ready to 
accept the inevitable.
	Makoto turned her head to look at Usagi and said, &#147;A contraction.  
They&#146;ve been a little more regular, but I didn&#146;t think&#133;  I&#146;m in labor.&#148;
	Usagi let out a nervous laugh and began to shake her head.  &#147;No, 
that can&#146;t be right.  It&#146;s the 5th.  You&#146;re not due until the 14th,&#148; 
she said logically.  &#147;So that can&#146;t be what it is.  What&#146;d you have for 
dinner?&#148;
	Makoto stared at her in disbelief.  &#147;Usagi, that was not my 
dinner.&#148;
	&#147;Well, it has to be something,&#148; argued the blonde.  She looked 
down at Chibi-usa, who now stood halfway between them and the chair 
she&#146;d been on.  &#147;It&#146;s something else, right?&#148;
	The little girl bit her lip and looked down, not answering.
	&#147;Chibi-usa,&#148; said Makoto calmly.  &#147;Answer her, please.&#148;
	Chibi-usa dug her toe into the floor as she said softly, 
&#147;Tomorrow.&#148;
	Makoto paled at that word and its implications.  &#147;What time 
tomorrow?&#148;
	Chibi-usa shrugged her shoulders.  &#147;I don&#146;t know.  But it doesn&#146;t 
happen until tomorrow.&#148;
	Usagi continued to shake her head.  &#147;Un un, no.  It&#146;s too soon.  
Ami has a plan and everything, and none of it starts until Friday.  
Besides, she said it wouldn&#146;t happen until the 17th, and Ami is NEVER 
wrong.&#148;
	&#147;Well, she is this time!&#148; bit out Makoto as another contraction 
tore through her.
	Usagi may have been in deep denial, but she stayed beside Makoto, 
talking to her and trying to get her to breathe through it, just the 
way they&#146;d been taught.  When it passed, Makoto opened her eyes.  Her 
breathing was hard, but she still managed to get out a command for 
Usagi.  &#147;Call Ami.  Now.&#148;


	The noise had no real directionality.  At least, to Rei it 
didn&#146;t.  If it hadn&#146;t been for the very distinctive ring tone, she 
would have been glad to be annoyed with the couple two rows ahead of 
them for leaving their cell phones on.  Instead, as the sound of Sailor 
V finishing off one of her enemies emanated from Minako&#146;s sweater 
pocket, she sunk down in her seat and tried to pretend it wasn&#146;t them.
	&#147;You know, you&#146;re supposed to turn that off before the movie 
starts,&#148; muttered Rei as Minako finally pulled the phone from her 
pocket.
	Seemingly oblivious to the death stares they were getting from 
the group on their right, Minako whispered back, &#147;I usually do.  Guess 
it&#146;s a good thing I forgot to this time, huh?&#148;  She hit the answer 
button on the phone, but before she could even say hello, Usagi&#146;s 
panicked voice came roaring through.
	&#147;I know you&#146;re on a date, and I&#146;m sorry, but she&#146;s in labor, and 
I can&#146;t get a hold of Ami!&#148; rambled out Usagi at a rapid fire pace.  
&#147;She&#146;s in class, so Luna won&#146;t let me use the communicators, but she 
won&#146;t answer her phone, and Luna told me to call you instead since I 
couldn&#146;t get her, and&#133;  Help!&#148;
	They&#146;d left their seats among the annoyed grumbles of the other 
moviegoers as soon as they heard Usagi&#146;s voice.  They were halfway 
through the lobby when that last plea made Minako reflexively pull the 
phone from her ear to save her hearing.
	&#147;We&#146;re closer to Ami than Mako-chan,&#148; thought Rei out loud.  &#147;Get 
her, then go to the apartment?&#148;
	Minako nodded, then said into the phone, &#147;Try and stay calm, 
Usagi.  It won&#146;t take us long to get there.  Can she wait long enough 
for us to pick up Ami first?&#148;
	Usagi started to answer, but was cut off by someone shouting 
something to her from across the apartment.  Minako couldn&#146;t make out 
what was said, though she did think she heard the words &#145;damn&#146; and 
&#145;water&#146;, but Usagi&#146;s answer came through loud and clear.
	&#147;What do you mean it broke?&#148; called back Usagi.  &#147;Well then, fix 
it!&#148;
	Minako took a deep breath and looked at Rei.  &#147;I think we&#146;re 
going to need a plan B.&#148;


	Hotaru watched from the passenger seat as Haruka clicked open her 
cell phone with a practiced ease.
	&#147;Hi, Michiru,&#148; answered the blonde.  &#147;You&#146;ve got great timing.  
Any later and you would have missed us.  We just passed Sagawa&#146;s and 
should be home in about 15 minutes.&#148;
	&#147;What does she want us to get?&#148; asked Hotaru curiously.
	Haruka shrugged one shoulder, then said into the phone, &#147;Why do I 
have to pull over?  I can drive and talk at the same time.  Just tell 
me what it is you want me to pick up.&#148;  Haruka sighed and paused for 
several seconds, blowing air through her lips.  As they stopped at a 
red light, she went on, &#147;Okay, I pulled over.  What?  Why?&#148;
	Hotaru raised her eyebrows, wondering what was being said on the 
other end.  Then she began to giggle as Haruka frowned and handed her 
the phone.
	&#147;Your mother wants to talk to you.&#148;
	Still grinning, Hotaru took the phone.  &#147;Hi, Michiru-mama.  Well, 
we were stopped, but the light changed and we&#146;re starting to drive 
again.  Okay.&#148;  Hotaru held the phone away from her and looked up at 
Haruka.  &#147;Michiru-mama says she&#146;s glad you like the couch so much since 
that&#146;s where you&#146;re going to be sleeping for the next month.&#148;
	Haruka rolled her eyes and finally gave in.  Muttering her 
annoyance under her breath, she flipped on her turn signal and pulled 
out of traffic.  When the car was safely parked on the side, Hotaru 
gave back the phone.  &#147;Okay,&#148; said Haruka, &#147;I really did pull over this 
time.  Now will you tell me what it is you couldn&#146;t tell me while I was 
driving?&#148;
	It all happened rather quickly after that.  Hotaru watched as her 
papa&#146;s eyes went wide and her hand clenched tight around the steering 
wheel.  After a rushed, &#147;Are you sure?&#148; and &#147;We&#146;ll meet you there,&#148; her 
papa tumbled the phone at her without fully closing it and threw the 
car into gear.  Hotaru didn&#146;t have time to check and see if anything 
was coming at them before Haruka made an illegal U-turn across four 
lanes of traffic.  However, the screeching of tires and blaring of 
horns let her know that, yes, there had indeed been traffic heading at 
them.  She gripped her seat and closed her eyes, because while she had 
absolute confidence in her papa&#146;s driving skills, Hotaru wasn&#146;t quite 
so trusting of the rest of Tokyo.
	After several seconds, Hotaru opened her eyes.  There were no 
flashing lights or sirens chasing them down, and even though they were 
passing the other drivers at a rate Haruka generally saved for the race 
track, Hotaru felt secure enough to ask a few questions.  &#147;What&#146;s 
happening?  Where are we meeting Michiru-mama?&#148;
	&#147;At the hospital,&#148; answered Haruka, never taking her eyes off the 
road.  &#147;After we pick up Mako-chan.  Looks like that kid of hers 
decided to make his appearance a little early.&#148;
	&#147;She&#146;s having the baby?&#148; said Hotaru, instantly perking up.  
&#147;Now?&#148;
	&#147;Yep,&#148; replied Haruka right before she slammed her hand against 
her horn to get the guy driving his Mercedes at the speed limit out of 
the passing lane.  
	Sinking into her seat a bit, Hotaru left Haruka alone so she 
could concentrate on the course ahead of her and reached for the cell 
phone that had fallen at her feet.  &#147;We were supposed to have another 
day,&#148; she muttered under her breath as she dialed quickly and fidgeted 
until Michiru answered.  &#147;It&#146;s me.  I&#146;m glad you didn&#146;t leave yet.  No, 
we&#146;re still in the car, but we should be there soon.  I just need you 
to get my bag for me.  It&#146;s got my cameras and everything in it.  No, 
it&#146;s by my bed.  Just bring it with you, please.  Okay.  Thank you.  
Bye.&#148;
	Hotaru closed the phone and held it securely in her lap.  It was 
a good thing she had listened all the times Setsuna-mama told her about 
being ready early and not waiting until the last minute to finish 
things.  If she&#146;d waited to pack until she got home tonight, she would 
have missed everything.


	The class was entering its second hour, and Ami supposed she 
couldn&#146;t blame the other students in the lecture hall for feeling a 
little restless.  A boy down on the left yawned and stretched when the 
professor turned his back to add more notes to the board.  Behind her, 
she could hear the quiet shifting of feet and bodies and whispers of 
what she thought might be apologies for stepping on a foot or nudging 
an arm.
	She pulled her bag a little closer, allowing an extra few seconds 
to glance at the phone clipped to the outside of it.  It was still on 
and with a full battery, but the nonexistent signal bar bothered her.  
Granted, it had worked perfectly well when she&#146;d called home earlier, 
even though the phone wasn&#146;t registering any signal, so she had no 
reason whatsoever to worry.  She reminded herself of that one more 
time, and looked back towards the front.
	Ami had just given her attention back to the professor when she 
heard the hushed voices behind her.  She tuned it out the way she 
always did with such distractions, until a finger tapped her shoulder.  
Mildly annoyed, she turned around, then leaned back closer when the 
girl indicated she should.
	Leaning down as best she could to whisper, the girl continued the 
chain that had started at the top of the hall.  &#147;Red peanuts roll down 
matched bugs car Ali is bored says hi and Mako-chan&#146;s in labor.&#148;  The 
girl nodded and grinned, quiet pleased with herself for being able to 
remember the whole convoluted thing.  Then her eyebrows knit together 
in confusion over why Mizuno had suddenly gone so pale.
	Ami looked around the girl and up at the back of the lecture hall 
frantically.  Her eyes finally landed on Minako in the last row, and 
the blonde waved at her.  Ami stood quickly, knocking her papers to the 
floor as she did, and said in a rush, &#147;But she isn&#146;t due for another 
week!&#148;
	The entire class stopped and stared, but Ami didn&#146;t even notice.  
The professor was the one who got her attention away from Minako.  &#147;Is 
there a problem?&#148;
	&#147;Yes,&#148; answered Ami bluntly before turning back to Minako for 
further information.
	&#147;Family emergency,&#148; picked up Minako.  &#147;We need to take Ami home 
with us.&#148;
	&#147;Fine, fine,&#148; said the professor.  &#147;Just get your things and go, 
Mizuno.&#148;
	Ami nodded and quickly grabbed her things, shoving them 
haphazardly into her bag.  She practically ran to the top of the 
stairs, oblivious to the whispers that followed her.  As they were 
hurrying to the car Rei had double parked and idling, Ami asked, &#147;Is 
she okay?  What happened, and why didn&#146;t anyone call me?  Or is it so 
bad that you had to get me in person?&#148;
	&#147;She&#146;s fine,&#148; reassured Minako.  &#147;Usagi tried to call you, but 
couldn&#146;t get through, so she called us instead.  Haruka&#146;s getting them, 
and we&#146;re all going to meet at the hospital.  We&#146;ve got everything 
covered, Ami.  It&#146;s all going to be all right.&#148;
	Ami shook her head as they climbed into the back seat of the car.  
&#147;I should have been there.  I knew I shouldn&#146;t leave her tonight, and I 
should have stayed home, no matter what she told me.&#148;
	Minako put her hand on Ami&#146;s arm and gave it a gentle squeeze.  
&#147;It&#146;s okay, Ami.  You made sure she wasn&#146;t alone when you couldn&#146;t be 
there, and no one expected anything to happen this soon, anyway.&#148;  She 
grinned, then said in a more teasing tone, &#147;Not even born yet, and he&#146;s 
already surprising you and making all of us crazy.  Just imagine what 
it&#146;s going to be like after he gets here.&#148;
	Ami smiled at her.  &#147;Thank you,&#148; she said softly.  Then she and 
Minako both looked down as Ami&#146;s phone started to beep.  She pulled it 
up and frowned at the full signal bar and the little voicemail icon 
with a number beside it.  &#147;Five?&#148;
	&#147;You know what?&#148; said Minako slowly as she reached over and 
extricated the phone from Ami&#146;s grip.  &#147;I bet all of those are from 
Usagi.  So how about you just let me handle checking them for you?&#148;
	&#147;Why?&#148; asked Ami, some paranoia creeping back in.  &#147;What aren&#146;t 
you telling me?&#148;
	&#147;Nothing,&#148; answered Rei quickly.  &#147;It&#146;s just that Usagi started 
to panic when she couldn&#146;t reach you.  And I think by the time she got 
us, she was more panicked than you really need to hear right now.&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re not telling me something,&#148; repeated Ami.  &#147;Is she really 
okay?&#148;
	&#147;She&#146;s fine,&#148; answered Minako.  &#147;We wouldn&#146;t lie to you about 
that.  But&#133;&#148;  Her eyes met Rei&#146;s in the rearview mirror, and the miko 
shrugged.  &#147;It&#146;s nothing bad,&#148; went on Minako.  &#147;It&#146;s just that, when 
Usagi was on the phone with us, Mako-chan&#146;s water broke.&#148;
	Ami sunk back against the car seat.  &#147;Already?&#148; she said quietly.  
&#147;All of that happened already, and I wasn&#146;t there.  I wanted to be with 
her.&#148;
	&#147;You will be,&#148; replied Rei.  &#147;Just like you&#146;ve always been.  
You&#146;ll be there so she can hold your hand and curse at you between 
contractions.  And you&#146;ll be there when your son is born.  That&#146;s the 
important part.&#148;
	Ami nodded, the disappointment still there, but understanding the 
truth in Rei&#146;s words.  &#147;How much longer until we get there?&#148;
	&#147;Twenty minutes if we don&#146;t hit traffic,&#148; answered Rei.  &#147;Thirty 
if we do.  We&#146;ll get you there in plenty of time, Ami.  Don&#146;t worry.&#148;
	Ami tried to relax and not think too hard about it.  She felt 
Minako&#146;s hand cover hers, and realized then how rapidly her foot was 
tapping against the floor.  Last time, she thought suddenly, it had 
been Usagi holding her hand, and the anxiety she felt had been tainted 
with fear.  She was still nervous and anxious, but this time it wasn&#146;t 
because of the fear.  Ami closed her eyes and took a deep breath, a 
smile slowly beginning to form on her lips.
	

	The door to her office always creaked slightly when it was opened 
slowly.  Some part of Kaya&#146;s tired mind registered the sound, but the 
familiarity of it relegated it to being ignored.  Her eyes never 
opened, and she turned a bit more onto her side as she dozed 
comfortably on the couch.
	Ken walked quietly through the dimly lit room, the only light 
coming from the small desk lamp Kaya was using as a nightlight.  He 
knelt beside the couch and smiled down at her before running the backs 
of his fingers lightly across her cheek.
	Kaya woke enough to open her eyes a slit and do a quick survey of 
her surroundings.  Hospital office, no lights, no nurses or beepers.  
No emergencies that needed her immediate attention.  And Ken.  She 
smile sleepily and raised a hand to pat his cheek.  &#147;Later,&#148; she rasped 
out.  &#147;Too tired now.  Need sleep.  And you shave.&#148;  With that 
pronouncement, her hand dropped back down and she rolled over onto her 
other side.
	Chuckling softly, Ken crossed his arms over his chest.  &#147;You are 
a stubborn one sometimes, aren&#146;t you?&#148; he said to her back.  &#147;Well, I&#146;m 
willing to wait, but I&#146;m not sure your grandson is.&#148;
	That penetrated the haze Kaya had been resting in, and she 
quickly turned back over.  &#147;What does that mean?&#148;
	&#147;It means,&#148; answered Ken, &#147;that Makoto&#146;s on her way in.  I just 
got the call from my service.&#148;
	Kaya sat up quickly and reached for the lamp beside the couch.  
&#147;But she isn&#146;t due for more than a week, and Ami seemed to fully expect 
her to go over her due date.  Is it still Monday?&#148; she asked, reaching 
for Ken&#146;s wrist and pulling it closer to squint at his watch.  &#147;Ami has 
class tonight.  Are they together?&#148;
	&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; answered Ken.  He stood and pulled her up with 
him.  &#147;The message only said that her water broke while she was at 
home, and that she was on her way to the hospital.&#148;
	&#147;What a mess,&#148; sighed Kaya.  &#147;I hope Ami was with her.  They 
haven&#146;t tried to call me at all, but they knew I was here, so they 
wouldn&#146;t have to.  She had an appointment with you over the weekend, 
didn&#146;t she?&#148;
	Ken nodded.  &#147;She&#146;s in perfect health.  There weren&#146;t any 
indications that she&#146;d go into labor just yet, but I don&#146;t expect any 
problems.&#148;
	&#147;Okay then,&#148; responded Kaya, rubbing her hands together and 
looking for all the world to Ken like she was about to start pacing the 
room.  &#147;First thing to do is get down to Labor and Delivery.  Make sure 
they know just who it is they&#146;ve got coming in.&#148;
	&#147;Throwing your weight around a bit, Mizuno-sensei?&#148; teased Ken 
with a wide grin.
	Kaya gave him a high class smirk in return.  &#147;Some people around 
here believe that just because I can garner a certain amount of respect 
and admiration from my peers that I have the same amount of clout to 
balance it out.  I have the reputation, so I might as well use it.  And 
what better way to use it than for my daughter?&#148;
	

	The car turned into the parking lot and pulled to a stop as close 
to Makoto&#146;s stairs as Haruka could get without actually parking on the 
lawn.  Hotaru had her door open before the keys had even been taken 
from the ignition.  Wanting to keep up with her papa&#146;s pace, she 
sprinted for the stairs.  When she wasn&#146;t overtaken by the fourth or 
fifth step, Hotaru stopped and turned around to see what was taking 
Haruka so long.  She stared in confusion as Haruka paused at the back 
of the car and opened the trunk.
	Haruka leaned into the trunk and moved a few things aside.  
Successful in her search, she straightened up and held in front of her 
the rubber mat she kept in case she needed to change a tire or get 
under the car while away from home.  The grey material was a bit 
spongy, kind of like the bathmat in their tub, only sturdier.  Having 
only been used once, it was still perfectly clean and would serve 
Haruka&#146;s purpose just fine.
	After closing the trunk, she moved around to the passenger side 
of the car.  Haruka knelt down and carefully laid the mat across the 
seat, tucking in the sides as best she could.  Taking a step back to 
survey her work, she nodded in approval and then gave the seat a gentle 
pat before closing the door.  That detail taken care of, she ran over 
to the steps and passed a still confused Hotaru.
	&#147;Aren&#146;t you coming?&#148; asked Haruka over her shoulder as she took 
the steps two at a time.
	Hotaru shrugged at her papa&#146;s retreating back, realizing there 
were some things she was better off not asking about.  Then she hurried 
up the stairs after her.
	Haruka didn&#146;t have any idea what to expect when she opened the 
door, but she had been expecting something just a bit more&#133; chaotic.  
Instead, Makoto was sitting in one of the dining room chairs, her eyes 
closed as she tried to keep her breathing even.  Usagi was beside her, 
holding her hand and looking like she was in more pain than Makoto.  
Luna was on the table behind them, while Artemis had taken up position 
further away on the back of the couch.
	Hotaru edged passed Haruka, who had stopped in the doorway, and 
hurried over to Makoto and Usagi.  When Makoto opened her eyes again, 
Hotaru smiled at her.
	&#147;Hey there,&#148; said Makoto after a few breaths.  &#147;Thanks for 
coming.  I was wondering when you would get here, and that was pretty 
quick.&#148;
	&#147;We hurried,&#148; said Hotaru.  &#147;Are you still okay?&#148;
	&#147;Yeah,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;As okay as I&#146;m going to be for awhile, 
anyway.&#148;
	&#147;Do you have everything?&#148; asked Haruka, coming further into the 
apartment.
	&#147;Almost,&#148; said Usagi.  She rubbed her hand, trying not to be too 
obvious about it.  &#147;Chibi-usa&#146;s getting the last thing.&#148;
	Right then, the little girl appeared from the hallway.  &#147;This is 
it, right, Mako-chan?&#148;
	Makoto nodded at the little cow Chibi-usa held.  &#147;That&#146;s it.  
Just put her in the pocket on the side of my bag.  We thought Suu would 
make a good focal point,&#148; explained Makoto at Haruka&#146;s questioning 
look.
	&#147;Whatever works for you, Mako-chan,&#148; replied Haruka.  She offered 
a hand and helped Makoto slowly to her feet.  &#147;Ready now?&#148;
	Makoto gave her a weak grin.  &#147;I think so.&#148;  Then she looked down 
at the cats, who were already moving towards the door.  &#147;I promise not 
to keep you in Usagi&#146;s backpack for long.  As soon as we get a room, 
we&#146;ll find someplace for you to stay.&#148;
	&#147;Don&#146;t worry about it,&#148; said Artemis.  &#147;We&#146;ve gotten used to 
these sorts of travel accommodations.&#148;
	&#147;Besides, we don&#146;t have to get in until we&#146;re at the hospital.  
So it won&#146;t be so bad,&#148; added Luna.
	&#147;Okay.  It looks like we&#146;ve got everything, and Ami&#146;s meeting us 
there,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;Let&#146;s get going.&#148;
	Everyone agreed except for Haruka.  A concerned look suddenly 
crossed her face, and she asked, &#147;Do you smell that?  Is something 
burning?&#148;
	&#147;The cupcakes,&#148; murmured Makoto, suddenly remembering what they&#146;d 
been doing before they&#146;d all been severely sidetracked.
	&#147;Oh no!&#148; yelped Usagi at the same time.  She dropped her bag and 
made a dash for the kitchen.  &#147;I forgot to set the timer!&#148;


	By this point, Ami had reached an entirely new level of 
frustration and anxiousness, and all her friends could do was stand 
there and watch as she vented some of it at the young nurse in the 
maternity ward.  &#147;What do you mean there&#146;s no one here by that name?!  
She has to be here!  There isn&#146;t anyplace else they would take her.&#148;
	The three of them had made it to the hospital without any 
problems and fully expected everyone to be there when they arrived.  
Instead, they&#146;d found an empty hallway and a proverbial brick wall.
	&#147;Check again, please,&#148; went on Ami as her hands gripped the 
counter around the nurses&#146; station.  &#147;Her name is Kino.  K-I-N-O.&#148;
	The nurse, who&#146;s ID read Shiana, smiled up at Ami and spoke 
calmly in an attempt to dispel some of the desperateness she could 
hear.  &#147;We don&#146;t have anyone checked in by that name, sweetheart.  
You&#146;ve probably just beaten her here, if this is where they were 
bringing her.  Tell you what, though.  I&#146;ll call downstairs and double 
check, just in case someone down there has seen her or heard something.  
Okay?&#148;
	Ami nodded and thanked her, relaxing and backing off a bit.
	&#147;What&#146;s going on?&#148;
	The voice of one of her coworkers caught Shiana&#146;s attention just 
as she picked up the phone.  She looked over at the woman who had 
walked up behind her and answered, &#147;We&#146;re trying to find a patient.  
I&#146;m calling downstairs to make sure she isn&#146;t here yet.&#148;
	The new arrival nodded as she picked up some paperwork.  &#147;Who are 
we looking for?&#148;
	&#147;Kino Makoto.&#148;
	Surprised green eyes looked away from the papers they&#146;d been 
scanning.  &#147;Mizuno-sensei&#146;s Kino Makoto?&#148;
	Shiana looked at her questioningly as Ami quickly answered, &#147;Yes.  
She is here, then?&#148;
	The nurse shook her head, &#147;No, I&#146;m afraid not.  But Mizuno-sensei 
wanted us to let her know when she and her daughter got here.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m her daughter.&#148;
	The nurse smiled at her.  &#147;It&#146;s good to meet you.  Kino-san isn&#146;t 
here yet, I promise you.  Why don&#146;t you and your friends have a seat 
over there for a few minutes, and we&#146;ll give your mother a call.  Maybe 
when she gets up here, your friend will have gotten here also.&#148;
	&#147;All right, and thank you,&#148; said Ami before moving back to Rei 
and Minako.
	As the girls went over to the chairs across from the nurses&#146; 
station, Shiana looked up at her friend and asked quietly, &#147;How did you 
know who she was?&#148;
	The other nurse grinned.  &#147;That&#146;s what you get for being on break 
when important people come for a visit.&#148;


	Once she got the call, it only took Kaya a few minutes to get 
herself together and down to where Ami was waiting.  The worry and 
excitement over it all were already there, carried quietly inside her 
and hidden from most of the people who saw her, but when she saw Ami 
for the first time that night, the true significance of the moment 
struck her.  Her steps slowed as she remembered with perfect clarity 
how it had felt to hold her daughter for the first time and see her own 
eyes staring up her from a tiny, scrunched up face.  Every other moment 
in her life paled in comparison to that one, and she was almost as 
overwhelmed by the idea that tonight it would be Ami in that position 
as she had been all those years ago when it was she herself.
	&#147;Mom!&#148;
	Ami&#146;s voice and the suddenness with which she approached snapped 
Kaya out of her memories.  As Ami&#146;s arms wrapped around her waist in a 
tight hug, Kaya smiled.  Returning the hug, she asked calmly, &#147;You were 
in class, weren&#146;t you?&#148;  When Ami nodded, she went on, &#147;I was afraid 
that had happened.  How&#146;s Makoto getting here?&#148;
	Ami pulled back from her mother and, with some help from Rei and 
Minako, explained everything up to the present point.
	&#147;We seem to be missing some key people,&#148; said a voice from behind 
them.
	Everyone looked over as Michiru and Setsuna arrived.
	Michiru, who&#146;s words had gotten their attention, smiled kindly at 
Ami.  &#147;How are you?&#148;
	Ami took a deep breath, then answered, &#147;I&#146;ll be much better once 
Mako-chan gets here.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m sure they aren&#146;t too far away,&#148; said Michiru.
	A wide smile formed on Minako&#146;s face.  &#147;Actually, she&#146;s a whole 
lot closer than you think.&#148;
	Following Minako&#146;s line of vision, Ami looked over into the 
hallway and immediately forgot everyone else around her as she hurried 
to meet the ones heading towards them.  Haruka stopped the wheelchair 
and grinned down at them as Ami reached for Makoto.  One hand found 
Makoto&#146;s as the other first went to Makoto&#146;s bangs and carefully 
brushed them away from her eyes before moving to gently stoke her 
cheek.
	Clearly relieved, Ami let out a sigh.  &#147;How are you doing so far?  
How much time between contractions?&#148;
	Unconsciously flexing her fingers around Ami&#146;s, Makoto answered, 
&#147;I&#146;m okay, I think.  There were a few that were really close together, 
but most have been about four or five minutes apart.&#148;  Makoto stopped 
and grinned at Usagi.  &#147;Truthfully though, I think so far, she&#146;s having 
a worse night than I am.&#148;
	For the first time, Ami really took notice of the people standing 
around her.  Holding Makoto&#146;s bag, Hotaru stood beside Haruka, who 
still had her hands on the wheelchair&#146;s handles, ready to take them 
wherever they needed to go.  Chibi-usa was standing closer to Usagi, 
who wore a sheepish expression on her face and was holding her backpack 
at an odd angle behind her back.
	&#147;It was dark and I couldn&#146;t see it,&#148; stated Usagi before Ami 
could ask.  &#147;I didn&#146;t know it was there.&#148;
	&#147;She sat on a cheesecake,&#148; explained Chibi-usa.  &#147;Splat!  Right 
down in the middle of it.&#148;
	&#147;My poor, genuine leather car seat,&#148; lamented Haruka piteously.
	&#147;I really am sorry,&#148; said Usagi as she turned pitiful blue eyes 
onto her senshi.
	Haruka closed her eyes and sighed.  &#147;Don&#146;t worry about it, 
Odango.  It&#146;s easily enough fixed.&#148;
	&#147;Excuse me,&#148; interrupted a nurse.  She smiled pleasantly at them.  
&#147;There&#146;s some paperwork that needs to be filled out.  If someone 
doesn&#146;t mind taking care of it, we can take her to get settled in.&#148;  
Several heads nodded as the nurse turned to Haruka, ready to hand over 
the clipboard she was holding.  &#147;Would you be the father?&#148;
	Caught off guard by that, Haruka hesitated in answering.  Amid 
the quiet giggles and snickers coming from her child and friends, she 
opened her mouth to say something, but was cut off by Usagi.
	&#147;No, no, no,&#148; laughed Usagi.  &#147;Haruka&#146;s&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Just a very good friend,&#148; inserted a mischievously grinning 
Michiru, stepping up and placing a hand on Haruka&#146;s arm.
	&#147;Oh,&#148; answered the nurse.  She looked around for any other 
suitable candidates.  &#147;Well then&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Here, we&#146;ll do it,&#148; offered Rei.  &#147;You guys go and do what you 
need to.&#148;
	Ami and Makoto thanked her, and then Ami took the bag Hotaru was 
holding.  Usagi reluctantly gave up her backpack to Makoto just before 
Haruka wheeled her away, following after the nurse and Ami&#146;s mother.
	When they were out of sight, Rei circled around behind Usagi.  
She shook her head at the cheesecake-colored stain on the back of 
Usagi&#146;s skirt and &#145;tsked&#146; a few times.
	Usagi sighed.  &#147;Yeah, I know.  I burned the cupcakes, too.  But 
at least we got here.&#148;
	Rei chuckled and folded her arms, holding the clipboard to her 
chest as she did.  &#147;Are you going to need a change of clothes?  I&#146;m 
sure we&#146;ve got enough time.  I can run you home if you want.&#148;
	Usagi looked at her in surprise.  &#147;You&#146;re not going to tease me?&#148;
	Rei shook her head.  &#147;Not tonight, Usagi.  I think you&#146;ve been 
traumatized enough.&#148;
	Usagi smiled hugely and, on pure impulse, threw her arms around 
Rei.
	Rei made a sound that was close to a surprised squawk as the 
clipboard was crushed between them.  &#147;Okay, okay,&#148; she said after a few 
seconds and an amused chuff.  &#147;Enough.  Do you need clothes or not?&#148;
	Letting her go, Usagi shook her head.  &#147;Haruka let me call home 
while we were in the car.  Mama&#146;s going to bring me some.  Besides, I 
needed to let her know what was going on and to make sure she would let 
both of us stay.&#148;
	 &#147;Is she going to?&#148;
	&#147;Yes.  She thinks this will be a good experience, and as long as 
Mako-chan doesn&#146;t mind, she doesn&#146;t either.&#148;  Then Usagi frowned as she 
remembered the rest of that conversation.  &#147;She also told me to pay 
close attention to what was happening, because she had to go through 
that for 17 &frac12; hours with me and 15 with Shingo.  Then she reminded me 
that long labors run in the family.  Have I mentioned lately that I 
want to be unconscious?  Cause I really don&#146;t think anyone&#146;s taking me 
seriously when I say that.&#148;
	Rei laughed and clapped a hand on Usagi&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;Don&#146;t 
worry, Usagi.  Even if we do forget, I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll find lots of ways 
to remind us.&#148;
	Hotaru giggled to herself as she passed by and overheard them.  
After some of the things she&#146;d heard coming from Makoto on the drive 
over, she wondered just how Usagi would choose to remind them when the 
time came.  And if it would be as varied and colorful as Makoto&#146;s.
	&#147;Did you bring it?&#148; asked Hotaru when she stopped in front of her 
mothers.
	Setsuna held out the small, purple duffle bag that very obviously 
held more than just Hotaru&#146;s cameras.  Before allowing the child to 
take it, she said quietly, &#147;I&#146;m certain Makoto will want pictures of 
the baby after he&#146;s born, but, for right now, I want you to respect her 
privacy and leave her be.  And when all of this is over, you, Chibi-
usa, and I are going to sit down and have a long discussion about the 
merits of discretion, keeping secrets, and preserving the timeline.&#148;
	&#147;Yes, Setsuna-mama,&#148; answered Hotaru contritely as she took the 
bag.  Her contriteness was short lived, however, as she and Chibi-usa 
led the charge to the waiting area, where everyone began to settle in 
for the long haul.


	Suu, CD&#146;s, snack bag, stopwatch to time the contractions&#133;  Ami 
held up the stopwatch and gave the buttons a few quick, experimental 
clicks before setting it aside and pulling out Makoto&#146;s dark green 
nightshirt.  They were alone in the room now, save for Artemis and 
Luna, who were making themselves scarce by hiding out in the bathroom.
	&#147;Here we go,&#148; said Ami as she slung the nightshirt over her arm 
and reached for Makoto.  &#147;Can you stand up for a few minuets?  That 
would make this easier.&#148;
	Makoto smiled at her from where she sat on the edge of the bed.  
&#147;I can stand.  I could have walked up here if Haruka would have let 
me.&#148;  But rather than move, she took Ami&#146;s hand and held it loosely in 
hers, watching intently as she twined their fingers.
	Able to feel the slight tremble in Makoto&#146;s hands, Ami laid the 
nightshirt on the bed.  Her free arm wrapped around Makoto&#146;s shoulders 
and gently pulled the girl to her.
	Makoto let go of Ami&#146;s hand and circled her arms around her 
waist, resting her head against Ami&#146;s chest.  &#147;I&#146;m never going to make 
you go to school ever again,&#148; she said around a deep sigh.  &#147;Everything 
just happened so fast, and then I wanted Usagi to call you, but she 
couldn&#146;t.  And we almost burned down the apartment.&#148;  She paused for a 
moment, enjoying the comforting feel of Ami&#146;s hand stroking her back.  
Then she said very quietly, &#147;Chibi-usa said tomorrow.  I think we&#146;re 
going to be here for awhile.  A really long while.&#148;
	She was trying not to let it show, but Ami could hear the faint 
fear and uncertainty in Makoto&#146;s words.  She bent down to place a kiss 
on the top of Makoto&#146;s head, then moved her back so she could see her 
eyes.  &#147;You can do this, Mako-chan.  And I&#146;ll be with you the whole 
time.&#148;
	Makoto smiled at her.  &#147;I&#146;m glad you&#146;re here.  I could never want 
anyone with me more than I do you.&#148;
	Ami smiled back and ran a finger slowly down Makoto&#146;s cheek.  
&#147;How about we get you changed now?  Saatchi-san should be here in a few 
minutes.  We&#146;ll be all ready by then.&#148;


	Rei stretched her arms out behind her as she walked back to the 
waiting area.  At just passed midnight, everyone was still awake and 
holding on, but some of them just barely.  Chibi-usa, Hotaru, and Usagi 
were on the floor together, juice boxes and coloring books on the table 
in front of them.  Or, in Hotaru&#146;s case, under her.
	The little girl looked up at Rei from where her head was resting 
on her folded arms.  &#147;How much longer?&#148; she asked.
	&#147;They&#146;re guessing maybe four or five more hours.&#148;
	Hotaru nodded at the answer, then abandoned her coloring book in 
favor of Setsuna&#146;s lap.  The older woman set down the magazine she&#146;d 
been looking through and adjusted them until they were both 
comfortable.
	&#147;Are we switching again?&#148; asked Usagi.  &#147;I think it&#146;s my turn to 
stay with them this time.&#148;
	Rei nodded.  &#147;But she wants to move around a little.  She said 
she&#146;s too uncomfortable just lying there for too long.&#148;
	&#147;That means it&#146;s my turn,&#148; said Haruka.  She grinned down at 
Michiru, who&#146;s head was resting against her shoulder.
	Michiru grinned back, then hid a yawn behind one hand as she sat 
up.  &#147;I&#146;ll be here when you get back.&#148;
	&#147;Where&#146;s Minako?&#148; asked Rei after Haruka had left.
	&#147;She said she wanted to walk around for awhile after we let Luna 
and Artemis outside,&#148; answered Usagi.  &#147;I left her down by the 
nursery.&#148;
	Rei nodded and went off in search of Minako.  She found her a few 
minutes later still standing in front of the nursery window.  &#147;Whatcha 
been doing?&#148; she asked as she stepped up and stood beside her.
	Minako grinned and answered quietly in deference to the stillness 
around them, &#147;Window shopping.&#148;
	Rei chuckled softly.  &#147;Really?&#148;
	&#147;Mm hm.  I want that one,&#148; said Minako, pointing to a bundle of 
pink.  &#147;She&#146;s so cute.  She can&#146;t be more than a day old, and look at 
all those curls.  She keeps scrunching up her face like she wants to 
cry, but then changes her mind, and she&#146;s so tiny.&#148;
	Putting an arm around Minako&#146;s shoulders, Rei replied, &#147;I told 
you before, Mina, babies aren&#146;t like kittens.  You can&#146;t just walk up 
to a window, pick out a cute one, and then bring it home like a stray.  
Besides, I don&#146;t think her mom would like that very much.&#148;
	Minako smiled at Rei&#146;s teasing and leaned in a little closer.  
They were alone in the corridor, the lights muted because of the hour.  
The stillness of everything made the movement of the reflection in the 
glass stand out even more, and out of reflex, her eyes glanced over in 
the newcomer&#146;s direction.  An uncharacteristically deep frown formed 
when she recognized who it was standing at the other end of the glass.  
&#147;What&#146;s he doing here?&#148; she asked, pulling Rei&#146;s attention to him.
	Rei mirrored Minako&#146;s frown when she saw Yuu standing there, his 
hands in the pockets of his jeans as he tentatively edged closer to the 
nursery window.  He wasn&#146;t looking towards them, but Rei didn&#146;t 
particularly care if he was ignoring them or just hadn&#146;t noticed them 
yet.  Dropping her arm from Minako&#146;s shoulders, she walked over to him.  
With her arms folded over her chest, she fixed him with the most 
intimidating stare she could and demanded to know what he was doing 
there how he&#146;d even known to come here to begin with.
	Yuu seemed startled by Rei&#146;s sudden nearness.  Minako watched him 
take a few reflexive steps back as she caught up to Rei.  Part of it, 
Minako guessed, was that he didn&#146;t recognize Rei right away.  But when 
she came up behind her, he finally put it all together.  Yuu pulled 
himself to his full height, which seemed to her to be just an inch or 
two taller than Makoto, and tried to match Rei&#146;s stare.
	&#147;It&#146;s none of your business why I&#146;m here,&#148; he returned defiantly.  
&#147;And you shouldn&#146;t even have to ask how I know.  Half of Mizuno&#146;s cram 
class goes to our school.  By tomorrow, everyone&#146;s going to know.&#148;
	&#147;It doesn&#146;t matter who knows or how,&#148; said Minako.  &#147;But Makoto 
and Ami are our family.  That makes all of this our business.  And it 
has nothing to do with you.&#148;
	&#147;Look,&#148; said Yuu, becoming more defensive, &#147;I just had some 
morbid curiosity about what was going on.  A friend&#146;s sister said 
Mizuno had lost it completely, and she&#146;s been acting weirder than usual 
lately.  It&#146;s got nothing to do with you, or them, or anything else.  I 
just wondered if Kino&#146;d had it yet&#133;&#148;  His words began to drift with his 
eyes as they turned back towards the window, only to be cut off as Rei 
placed herself deliberately between him and the glass.
	Throwing his hands up in exasperation, Yuu began to back away 
from them.  &#147;You know what,&#148; he said angrily, &#147;I don&#146;t care.  Kino and 
the rest of you be damned.  This isn&#146;t my problem.&#148;  With that, he 
turned and walked quickly away.
	&#147;Jerk,&#148; muttered Rei to his retreating back.
	Several moments passed in silence before Minako finally asked, 
&#147;What do you think that was all about?&#148;
	Rei shook her head.  &#147;I don&#146;t have a clue.&#148;
	&#147;We should tell Ami.&#148;
	&#147;No,&#148; said Rei.  She saw the question in Minako&#146;s eyes and 
explained further, &#147;We certainly can&#146;t tell her now, and saying 
anything later would be pointless.  Just mentioning him upsets both of 
them, so let&#146;s just let it go.  We handled it, and brining it up later 
isn&#146;t going to do anyone any good.&#148;
	Rei&#146;s logic didn&#146;t completely satisfy her, but Minako found 
herself agreeing nonetheless.  Casually taking Rei&#146;s hand, she said, 
&#147;Let&#146;s go back.  I want to see how Mako-chan&#146;s doing for myself.&#148;
	With a grin, Rei draped her arm back around Minako.  Together 
like that, they made their way back to the waiting area.


	There were times when she had to remind herself that just because 
she was at the hospital didn&#146;t mean she was on duty.  The work, 
however, provided Kaya with a distraction she was glad to have tonight.  
As much as she liked Ami&#146;s friends, she wasn&#146;t really comfortable 
sitting and waiting with them, just as she wasn&#146;t completely 
comfortable hovering over Makoto as much as she felt she wanted to.  So 
the work was welcome, in its own way, and helped her pace out the time 
between visits.
	She passed the girls in the waiting area, all of them finally 
given into the need for sleep.  In the room, she found Usagi the same 
way, curled up on the couch with Ami&#146;s stuffed animal hugged tightly to 
her.  She might have smiled at the sight if she hadn&#146;t been so 
completely focused on Makoto and Ami.
	The regular room lights had been turned out and replaced by the 
bluish white of the nightlight over the bed.  Makoto sat in the middle 
of the bed, several pillows in her lap for her to lean on, while Ami 
sat behind her, rubbing her back and talking too quietly for Kaya to 
make out the words.  Makoto&#146;s eyes were squeezed shut beneath her 
sweaty bangs, and one fist was twisted tightly around the sheet as a 
sound somewhere between a hum and a whimper slowly escaped from her.  
After several seconds, she began to relax marginally, though her eyes 
didn&#146;t open.  She was holding up remarkably well, in Kaya&#146;s opinion, 
but the exhaustion was plain to see in her features.
	Kaya walked over to the bed and carefully sat on the corner.  She 
smiled at Ami, who gave her a tired grin in return, before reaching 
forward to smooth back a few strands of hair that had come loose from 
Makoto&#146;s ponytail.  Quietly, she asked, &#147;How&#146;s everything going?  
Everyone out there tells me you&#146;ve been doing very well.&#148;
	&#147;I am never doing this again,&#148; answered Makoto tensely.
	Kaya nodded, sympathizing with the sentiment.  Her hand dropped 
back into her lap and folded with her other as she said, &#147;It shouldn&#146;t 
be too much longer, though I remember when people said that to me, it 
really didn&#146;t make things much better.  And Ami was taking so long&#133;&#148;
	Makoto cracked her eyes open to peer at the woman in front of 
her.  &#147;How long?&#148;
	Kaya grinned in spite of herself.  &#147;Well, from the time I first 
realized I was in labor until she was born, it all took about 34 
hours.&#148;
	For a moment, Makoto&#146;s jaw went slack.  Then her lip began to 
quiver as her eyes filled with weary tears.  Shaking her head, she 
whispered hoarsely, &#147;I can&#146;t.  I can&#146;t do it for that long.  I&#146;m so 
tired, and I just want it all to be over.  Please don&#146;t make me do it 
for that long.&#148;
	Kaya&#146;s heart broke at that, and she wished dearly that she could 
take it back.  Ami looked like she wanted to cry herself as she tried 
to reassure Makoto that it would only be another hour or two, and Kaya 
once again reached out to her in an attempt to repair the bit of 
damaged she felt she&#146;d done.  Her thumb wiping away the tear that was 
trailing down Makoto&#146;s cheek, Kaya went on, &#147;I didn&#146;t mean to make you 
cry, sweetheart.  Most people usually find it amusing when I tell them 
that, but I suppose now just wasn&#146;t the right time for it.  And I know 
for a fact you&#146;ll have this baby by the time the sun rises.  He&#146;s like 
you that way.  Ami just needed some extra time to think things through 
and make sure being born was the right decision for her, and she wasn&#146;t 
going to be rushed into it.  That&#146;s always been her nature, even back 
then.&#148;
	Kaya startled as Makoto&#146;s hand unexpectedly latched onto the 
white jacket she wore and tried to tug her closer.  Still a bit 
surprised by the action, Kaya moved forward until Makoto stopped her by 
awkwardly putting her arms around her and resting her forehead against 
her shoulder.
	&#147;Promise?&#148; asked Makoto.
	&#147;I promise,&#148; answered Kaya reassuringly.  She carefully moved the 
pillows on Makoto&#146;s lap out from between them to make things less 
awkward, and then began a gentle, tentative stroking over Makoto&#146;s 
hair.  The girl&#146;s grip on her remained, her fists tightening into the 
white material on each contraction as the first syllable of a curse 
would be cut off by that same humming until it had passed.
	Glad to be here and able to help, Kaya began to ease into the 
role she was playing, taking some of the pressure off of Ami for 
awhile.  &#147;You know,&#148; she began somewhat aimlessly, &#147;my grandmother 
would be very impressed by you if she was here right this moment.  
&#145;Times may change, but people don&#146;t.&#146;  She&#146;s always saying that to me.  
Back when I had Ami, she didn&#146;t understand why I insisted on going to a 
hospital, because if having her children at home with nothing but her 
mother and a midwife was good enough for her, then it was certainly 
good enough for me.  She completely missed the point.&#148;
	&#147;The epidural,&#148; supplied Ami, enjoying listening to her mother 
talk.  More so than usual because Makoto seemed glad to have her there 
as well.
	&#147;That&#146;s right,&#148; answered Kaya.  She reached back and patted Ami&#146;s 
cheek affectionately.  &#147;Pregnancy didn&#146;t really suit me very well.  The 
result was worth it, though, even if it did throw off my plan.  Ami 
came a few years early, you see, since I wasn&#146;t planning on having my 
first until I was 30.  Then I was going to have the second four or five 
years later.  One of each, that way, Suoh and Father would have a boy 
to keep them happy, and Mother and Gram would have a girl.&#148;  
	Kaya chuckled lightly as she reflected back on that part of her 
life.  &#147;It seems almost silly to me now, thinking Suoh could have been 
any happier with a son.  He was so absolutely fascinated by Ami, and so 
completely in love.  Every little thing she did captivated him, and he 
always talked about how she would follow him with her eyes when he 
worked.  Those first few weeks after we brought her home, even with 
Gram and my mother there, I was terrified.  She was so small, and it 
felt like everything I was doing was wrong because none of it was 
working the way the books said it was supposed to.  Suoh, on the other 
hand, would just pick her up like he&#146;d done it a million times before 
and stick a bottle in her mouth without even thinking about it.  And he 
would keep her tucked in one arm like she was a football while he 
showed her how to sketch out a landscape or portrait.&#148;
	Makoto grinned against Kaya&#146;s shoulder as Ami said, &#147;That made 
Gram crazy, didn&#146;t it?&#148;
	&#147;There were a lot of things about your father that made Gram 
crazy,&#148; replied Kaya evenly.  &#147;The only time she ever lost her temper 
with him, though, was when I was in labor and his fidgeting got to be 
too much for all of us.  She and Mother banished him out to the waiting 
room with the rest of the men, which was where Gram thought he should 
have been to begin with, until you were actually being born.&#148;  Kaya had 
never asked how all those hours had gone for him.  She knew 
instinctively that putting Suoh, her father, and Kyo into the same room 
together wasn&#146;t a good idea, but at the time, she hadn&#146;t really cared.  
Now, she just flat out didn&#146;t care to think about it at all.  Instead, 
she chose to muse over a personality that a part of her, on very rare 
occasions, missed.
	&#147;That was one of the odd things about Suoh,&#148; she went on.  &#147;He 
could sit for hours and look out over a field or up at the sky without 
ever putting pencil to paper.  Then he&#146;d lose days in his studio just 
starting at a blank canvas without moving.  But with anything else, he 
was like a child with ADD.  If something wasn&#146;t happening right then 
and there to hold his attention, he would start to fidget until someone 
granted him freedom.&#148;
	&#147;Ami&#146;s like that,&#148; inserted Makoto.  She shifted a bit, trying to 
find a better angle to sit at and adjusting herself more comfortably 
against Kaya.  &#147;Not that last part, but the part about losing time.  
She does that when she studies.  She works too hard sometimes.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s cheeks reddened just a bit at the observation, and Kaya 
smiled.  Tilting her head down just a bit, she said softly against 
Makoto&#146;s ear, &#147;That&#146;s why I&#146;m glad she has you.&#148;


	Usagi had never woken up so fast in her life.  Under the bright 
lights of the hospital room, she scrambled from the couch to her feet 
and watched in wide-eyed wonder as the medical staff moved quickly into 
place.
	Ami and her mother stood next to Makoto, one on each side, 
holding her hands and helping support her when the doctor told her to 
push.  Red-faced from the exertion, Makoto had given up any and all 
pretense of quiet and civil.  The deep-throated string of invectives 
that issued from her as she put the last of her energy reserves into it 
reverberated through the room and caught the surprised attention of the 
people several rooms away.
	&#147;Good girl,&#148; said Ken when they paused for Makoto to take a 
breath.  &#147;We&#146;re almost there.  One more good push should do it.  As 
soon as you&#146;re ready.&#148;
	Makoto nodded once, then tightened her grip on the two standing 
beside her.  A grunt of effort turned into another hard yell until, 
finally, she fell back, gulping in relieved breaths as her own voice 
was replaced with the high pitched cries of newborn.
	A shaky laugh escaped from Ami, and she could feel the tears that 
had suddenly started to run down her cheeks.  She wiped at them hastily 
before reaching down to stroke Makoto&#146;s bangs away from her eyes.  As 
Saatchi-san announced for everyone that it was a healthy boy with all 
his fingers and toes, Ami placed a kiss against Makoto&#146;s forehead, 
smiling against her skin in a way the reflected Makoto&#146;s own happy-but-
tired grin.  Still holding onto Makoto, they watched as Saatchi-san 
clamped off the cord and finished cleaning the baby&#146;s mouth and nose.  
Then he smiled up at Ami as a nurse held out a pair of surgical 
scissors to her.
	&#147;This is your big moment, Ami,&#148; he said happily.
	Ami nodded, her smile widening even more.  She swiped at her eyes 
one more time and forced her hands to steady before nearing her still 
mewling son.  The small snip seemed to startle him a bit, and his 
crying started again in earnest before a blanket was wrapped loosely 
around him and he was handed to his mother.
	As the baby was placed against her chest, Makoto&#146;s perspective 
narrowed down to nothing more than this one, tiny person.  His skin was 
red and wrinkled, the little bit of brown hair on his head dark and 
matted.  His feet were smaller than her palm, and his fingers barely 
fit around her thumb as she stroked his hand with her finger.  His 
crying had slowly calmed, and his lips moved just a bit, putting a 
dimple in one chubby cheek.  Makoto gently ran the back of a finger 
over his dimple, letting out a soft laugh as she did.  At the sound of 
her voice, his eyes started to ease open.  He blinked a few times, 
looking almost dazed, before turning his unfocused gaze up to hers.
	And for a just a moment, the universe stopped as she saw eternity 
in a pair of deep blue eyes.
	&#147;Hey, look,&#148; said Usagi in quiet awe as she slid up to them and 
stood beside Kaya to look down at the baby.  &#147;His eyes are almost 
exactly like Ami&#146;s.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s smile turned shy as her hand moved carefully over the 
baby&#146;s head.  &#147;Most babies are born with blue eyes, Usagi,&#148; she said 
softly.  &#147;In a few days, they&#146;ll begin to change to green.&#148;
	&#147;Maybe,&#148; answered Usagi dubiously.  She held a finger out for the 
baby, and he caught it in an uncoordinated grip.  Usagi giggled happily 
at him, telling him how cute and perfect he was.  After a few minutes, 
she unwillingly pulled herself away from his attention.  &#147;I gotta go 
tell the others.  If I wait too long, they&#146;ll hurt me.&#148;  Then, after 
one more glance down at the baby, she excused herself and hurried out 
to her friends.
	Ken smiled after her, then looked over at Kaya.  She was biting 
her lip, partially obscuring the smile she wore, and refusing to let 
the shine in her eyes spill over.  He&#146;d already heard how she&#146;d 
promised death and double shifts to the first person on staff who 
called her &#145;Grandma,&#146; but he knew she was just as happily caught up in 
it all as the girls were.  Turning back to Makoto, he smiled almost 
mischievously, and said, &#147;How about you give him to Grandma for a few 
minutes, so we can get both of you fixed up a bit.  I promise we&#146;ll 
give him right back.&#148;
	Not seeing the look that earned him from Ami&#146;s mother, Makoto 
agreed, albeit reluctantly.  After handing the baby to Kaya, she smiled 
up at Ami and nodded, giving her the permission she wanted to go with 
them.
	&#147;Does he have a name yet?&#148; asked the nurse as she began to fiddle 
and fuss with the baby.
	&#147;Miki,&#148; answered Ami.
	&#147;That&#146;s a good name.  Now, let&#146;s see&#133;  You joined us on May 6th 
at 5:23 am,&#148; she went on as she checked the numbers on the side of the 
small table.  &#147;Twenty-one inches and seven pounds, twelve ounces.  
You&#146;re going to be a big boy, aren&#146;t you?&#148;  She finished wrapping a 
blanket around him and put a blue cap over his head.  Just before 
handing him to Ami, she smiled at him and said, &#147;Welcome to the world, 
Kino Miki.  I hope you have a long and happy stay.&#148;


*            *            *

	Several hours had passed.  All of their friends had come and 
gone.  Kaya had left them alone to give them time to get to know each 
other as a family, but now she was ready to head home herself, and she 
wanted to see them one more time before she did.  Stopping at the door 
to Makoto&#146;s room, she stood and stared inside, trying to take it all 
in.  She felt the presence of the man behind her before she saw him, 
and on instinct, leaned back against him.
	Ken wrapped his arms around her for the few minutes she would 
allow it and said, &#147;You&#146;ve had some time to really think about it now.  
How does it all feel?&#148;
	&#147;Surreal,&#148; answered Kaya without missing a beat.  Then she 
grinned.  &#147;But good.  It feels good.&#148;
	&#147;How about coming back to the apartment for awhile?&#148; asked Ken.  
&#147;I can at least give you breakfast and a little time for some real 
sleep before I have to leave again.&#148;
	Kaya smiled, surprised at how easily she found herself agreeing 
to it.  &#147;Just let me say goodbye first.&#148;
	Ken nodded, then kissed the top of her head before leaving her 
alone with the girls.
	Kaya took a few more minutes to gather her thoughts together and 
then went into the room.  In the soft morning light, Makoto slept 
soundly, the combined result of her own exhaustion and pain killers.  
Ami sat in a chair beside the bed with Miki asleep in her arms.
	Smiling down at her daughter, Kaya traced a finger along the 
baby&#146;s ear and said, &#147;I have to leave for a while, but I&#146;ll be back 
this afternoon.  You should let them take him to the nursery for a bit 
so you can get some rest, too.&#148;
	Ami shook her head, the act reminding her mother of a petulant, 
overly tired toddler.  &#147;They said we could keep him as long as we 
wanted,&#148; she argued quietly, her eyes staying focused on the baby.  
&#147;Besides, Mako-chan had him all to herself for nine months.  It&#146;s my 
turn now, and I want to make sure he knows who I am before I have to 
give him back.&#148;  Then she grinned widely and looked up at her mother 
with a sleepy-drunk kind of happiness.  &#147;He has blue eyes.&#148;
	Kaya couldn&#146;t help but chuckle.  So much for rational logic, she 
thought.  &#147;I saw,&#148; she said softly, grinning back at Ami.  &#147;He has very 
nice eyes, sweetheart, and so do you.  Except, right now, yours are 
drooping so much I can barely tell.  So, here, let me have him, and 
we&#146;ll compromise,&#148; she went on as she carefully lifted Miki from Ami&#146;s 
arms.
	Ami frowned at her mother in silent protest while the baby fussed 
at being moved from a warm and comfortable spot.
	Experience had taught her how to resist Ami&#146;s pout, even if the 
attempts weren&#146;t always equally successful.  This time, she distracted 
herself by humming softly to the baby as she walked him over to the 
hospital bassinet.  &#147;I know you like it better when your mama holds 
you,&#148; she said quietly.  &#147;And I understand why she would rather be 
holding you.  But right now, you all need some rest, so be a good boy 
for your Grandma Kaya and sleep.&#148;
	&#147;His Nana,&#148; corrected Ami as she walked up behind her mother.  
&#147;Mako-chan asked if you would mind.  It was what she called her 
grandmother, and she never really thought he would have one, but now 
that he does&#133;&#148;
	     Kaya smiled at Ami, touched deeply by what she was being 
given here.  &#147;I would like that very much,&#148; she said.  Then she turned 
her attention back to the baby, placing a kiss against his cheek before 
laying him down.  To Ami, she said, &#147;Let him sleep here for awhile, and 
you lie down and do the same.  When you wake up, he&#146;ll be right here 
waiting for you and wanting attention.&#148;
	Ami nodded, hiding a long yawn behind her hand.
	&#147;Good,&#148; replied Kaya to Ami&#146;s almost answer.  Then she reached 
forward and pulled her into a hug.  &#147;I love you, sweetheart.&#148;
	&#147;I love you, too, Mom.&#148;
	After a few quiet moments, Ami walked her mother to the door, 
grinning to herself when she saw Ken standing at the end of the hall 
trying to look like he wasn&#146;t waiting.  When her mother was gone, 
rather than going to the couch, Ami went back to the chair she&#146;d been 
sitting in and pulled it closer to the bed.  Her fingers brushed 
against Makoto&#146;s as she lay her head down beside Makoto&#146;s arm.  Her 
eyes had drifted closed and she was almost asleep when she felt fingers 
move against her own.  Those fingers moved up and began slowly brushing 
through her hair.
	Ami turned her head and smiled at her barely awake partner.  &#147;Hey 
there.  Are you feeling okay?  I thought you&#146;d sleep longer.  Mom made 
me put the baby down, but I&#146;ll get him for you if you want.&#148;
	Makoto smiled back at her and would have nodded if her eyes 
hadn&#146;t started to slip shut once again.
	&#147;When you wake up,&#148; whispered Ami as she allowed her own eyes to 
close and her fingers to thread through Makoto&#146;s.  &#147;I&#146;ll get him for 
you when we wake up.&#148;</pre>
