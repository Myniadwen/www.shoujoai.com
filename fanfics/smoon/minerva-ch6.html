<a href="../smoon/minerva-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Do we call woman whore? Ay, verily and amen, she is that; the air 
shudders and burns as we shout it, exulting and eager.

O ye! Was not this your sneer, your vile whisper that scorned her and 
shamed her? Was not &quot;whore&quot; the truth of her, the title of terror that 
you gave in your fear of her, coward comforting coward with furtive 
glances and gesture?

But we fear her not; we cry whore, as her armies approach us. We beat on 
our shields with our swords. Earth echoes the clamor!

Excerpt from The Law is for All by Aleister Crowley.

----

---The Silver Millennium---

There was no military per se on the small planet. None was needed. Under 
Minerva&#39;s guiding hand there&#39;d never been any wars, and without nearby 
hostile neighbors there was little necessity for any armed militias. 
There was however an ever present threat from the asteroids and comets 
swirling around in the Kuiper Belt, and the planet did have a defense 
system to defend itself from such outer space disasters.

It was this network of defenses that the enemy warships attacked first. 
By the time Minerva had exited what was left of the emissarial ship, 
these defenses were already destroyed and the enemy had already begun to 
open fire on her palace and her unarmed subjects.

She looked around at her once beautiful capital city, now little more 
than ashes and corpses. She then looked up at the hundreds of ships 
darkening her sky. Clutching her magical shield at her side, she 
launched herself into the air towards the unknown enemy who had 
destroyed all she loved and held dear. As she approached them, a yellow 
ball of light began to form between her hands.

------

From the mother ship, Commander Yukio smiled as he saw the ships of his 
fleet spread out around the small planet below him. As the blue-skinned 
warlord watched, missile after missile burst on the planet&#39;s surface. 
The once beautiful green planet slowly began to take on a dull 
brownish-red hue, as the explosions began to trigger volcanic activity. 
It would soon be over, he thought with a chuckle. They would then move 
on and...

Just then a warning siren began to blare out over the ships intercom. 
From the bottom left corner of the view screen, Yukio saw first one, and 
then three more warships explode as a small golden-yellow orb moved with 
incredible speed from the surface of the planet, firing some sort of 
small projectiles at his fleet. The orb then began flying back and forth 
from one ship to the next, swerving and weaving around the laser fire 
being aimed at it as it continued to take ships out.

&quot;Ensign!&quot; Commander Yukio barked, &quot;Get me magnification of the enemy, 
now!&quot;

The image on the view screen went in for a closer look. The image of a 
woman warrior in a golden skirt appeared on the screen, a bronze shield 
on her left arm and she appeared to be yelling something. Each time she 
did, a large yellow ball containing hundreds of long electric blue 
arrows materialized on their own, white sparks of static electricity 
encircling the shafts and arrow points. As she threw the ball and sent 
her projectiles flying, they exploded on impact with the warships, 
tearing them apart.

She moved so fast, and sent her arrows with such speed, that the ensign 
soon lost sight of the warrior. The commander&#39;s jaw dropped. He&#39;d faced 
battlefields before, fought in dozens of campaigns, but never had he 
seen the likes of this.

&quot;P... Pull the view back.&quot; he managed to stutter out, &quot;Get me a long 
shot.&quot;

The long shot revealed that their mission had been a success. The 
planet&#39;s surface had been transformed from a green paradise into a 
red-hot hell. Unfortunately, he&#39;d lost almost his entire fleet. Worse 
yet, the thing from the planet&#39;s surface was beginning to come toward 
his command vessel.

------

&quot;War Arrows!&quot; she screamed, sending yet another of the ships to 
oblivion.

Tears, warm and bitter, fell down Minerva&#39;s face. She could no longer 
feel her people; no longer sense her subjects calling to her to save 
them. The voices of planet Minerva had been silenced forever in a 
preemptive attack by these monsters from deep space. Waves of sorrow 
washed over her as she realized she had failed her people; there was no 
one left to save. Her people&#39;s culture; their music, their festivals, 
even their language, were now no more. As she looked at the three 
remaining warships and their command ship, her eyes narrowed angrily as 
she clenched her fists. For Minerva, there was nothing left but 
vengeance.

Before she could extract it, however, something came flying up towards 
her from the surface of the planet. Slamming into her force field, it 
took her momentarily by surprise. Dark, sinister energy swirled around 
the object as it reached out and penetrated through the protective 
field, swiping downward and cutting deep into her left shoulder blade 
before flinging her back down to the planet&#39;s surface. The thing watched 
with glee as a small impact crater formed where she landed. It then flew 
down after her.

As Minerva slowly began to crawl out of the crater, she winced at the 
pain from the gaping wound in her shoulder, as well as the three broken 
ribs she&#39;d received upon impact with the planet&#39;s surface. If not for 
her shield, she would be dead now. Clutching her ribs, she forced 
herself back up on her feet as she looked up to see something surrounded 
by a black ball of energy come towards her. When less than fifty feet 
away, the energy dissipated to reveal the form of her chancellor Maiya 
frowning angrily at her, blood dripping from the nails of her right 
hand.

&quot;You filthy bitch!&quot; she spat out at the princess, &quot;My fleet. You&#39;ve 
destroyed my fleet! No matter, princess; victory shall still be mine!&quot;

Minerva shook her head in dismay at what she was seeing and hearing. 
&quot;M... Maiya...&quot; she gasped out, each breath a new experience in pain as 
one of her ribs had punctured her left lung &quot;Why?&quot;

The thing in front of her smiled as its eyes glowed red. &quot;Sorry 
princess, Maiya no longer exists. There is only me now.&quot;

&quot;W... What... are you?&quot; Minerva managed to get out. She could feel her 
knees buckling beneath her as a small pool of blood started to form at 
her feet from her shoulder wound.

&quot;I am the cosmic whore,&quot; the thing answered, &quot;the scarlet woman who 
drinks deep of the cup of my abominations. I am incest and rape and 
murder and adultery and the lust for power and riches that lead to 
madness. I AM BABYLON, and I claim this planet and the rest of this 
small solar system for my own!&quot;

Personal journal of John Whiteside (Jack) Parsons

--

I&#39;ve been tricked.

We&#39;ve all been tricked. Crowley, the members of the O.T.O., myself. We 
were all patsies, all mere marionettes being played by higher 
intelligences. No, not intelligences; a single intelligence. I look at 
my work from six years ago with disgust and loathing. I had such high 
hopes for the future of mankind through the liberation Babylon was to 
bring. I can still remember the late nights, utilizing the Enochian 
Tablet of Air as I and my then brothers and sisters in the O.T.O. tried 
to give substance to the elemental summons.

I learned too late that Babylon was no goddess, no shining star of 
freedom and liberation. Too late, I learned I&#39;d become the butt of a 
cosmic joke. Her cosmic joke.

Three years ago with the hope of using darkness to battle darkness, I 
took the Oath of the Abyss, and took the new magical name Belarion 
Armiluss Al Dajjal AntiChrist.

Needless to say, it didn&#39;t work. The magical child simply absorbed the 
darkness into itself, becoming more powerful.

The thing must die. Now, before it becomes any more powerful.

Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be moving some explosives in my garage laboratory. The 
U.S. government is interested in some of my recent experiments with 
fulminate of mercury. Once I have the volatile material safely stored 
away, I intend to take my thirty-eight caliber and find the monster. 
What becomes of me is no longer important. It must end now.

---Tokyo, the Present---

Haruka held Michiru close as they watched the concert on T.V. Michiru 
hadn&#39;t spoken much overthe last hour, and her wife was nervous about 
breaking the silence. From upstairs, they heard their daughter Hotaru 
coming down the stairs.

&quot;Is Setsuna-mama home yet?&quot; the teen asked, anxious for any news about 
the date one of her moms was having with her teacher.

&quot;No, and shouldn&#39;t you be in bed?&quot; Haruka asked, &quot;Tonight&#39;s a school 
night, remember?&quot;

Michiru nodded in agreement. &quot;You can find out all about it tomorrow 
morning hon. Now go get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot; their daughter said, &quot;I just hope everything went alright for 
her.&quot;

&quot;We all do.&quot; Haruka answered, &quot;Good night.&quot;

As they both heard Hotaru go back upstairs and her bedroom door shut, 
Haruka turned to Michiru and finally broke the silence.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Michi-chan.&quot; she began, &quot;I know you&#39;re upset and disappointed 
in me, but I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of you suffering anymore, not 
like you did yesterday.&quot;

Michiru smiled at Haruka as she brushed a few of the blonde&#39;s bangs 
back. &quot;I know you worry about me dear, and I love you for it. But you 
have to remember; I am a Senshi. I&#39;m not made of glass, and I&#39;m not 
going to break every time something attacks me.&quot;

Before Haruka could respond, Setsuna entered through the front door. 
Michiru turned to her friend with a smile. The smile quickly faded when 
she saw the woman&#39;s dejected face as she took off her shoes to enter the 
house. She picked the pair of high heels up and sullenly set them to the 
side next to the doorframe. She then closed the door, leaning her head 
against the wood as she sighed deeply.

&quot;Sets?&quot; Haruka asked, likewise concerned by the Time Senshi&#39;s behavior. 
She removed her arm from around Michiru as she got up off the couch to 
go over to the morose looking woman, &quot;Sets, what happened?&quot;

Setsuna looked at the handsome tomboy in her dress shirt and black 
slacks, and slowly shook her head.

&quot;Why?&quot; she asked as her voice began to crack, &quot;Why am I destined to 
always be alone, bereft of companionship or comfort. Why... am I...&quot; she 
broke down and started to weep. Haruka took Setsuna in her strong arms 
as Michiru rushed over to likewise comfort her.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;We... We were having a wonderful time. She was so sweet, and I... we 
kissed, and... And the timegate... I had to leave her.&quot;

Michiru gave Haruka a look, and the blond nodded and went off to the 
kitchen. The Sea Senshi was always better in these situations, and while 
she was comforting Setsuna, Haruka began to fix them all something to 
drink.

&quot;She&#39;ll never want to see me again.&quot; Setsuna whimpered, &quot;Why? Why am I 
cursed with the timegate?&quot;

Michiru was about to offer words of comfort when something suddenly 
occurred to her. &quot;Setsuna, when did you feel the call of the timegate?&quot;

Setsuna sniffed as she looked at her friend funny. &quot;Around ten.&quot; she 
answered, &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because I felt something just around the same time.&quot; she said, &quot;And 
yesterday you were called away when I was attacked, and the day before 
that it was when Rei was knocked out.&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s eyes widened as she began to comprehend what Michiru was 
getting at. &quot;You think there&#39;s a connection?&quot; she asked as she wiped 
away her tears. The Sea Senshi nodded.

&quot;Look, now that we know there&#39;s a possible connection, it leaves us a 
little bit less in the dark. As for you and Kihomi, you need to talk 
with her.&quot;

&quot;Michi-chan&#39;s right.&quot; Haruka said as she entered the room with two small 
wine glasses, passing one to each of her fellow Senshi. &quot;At the very 
least, just tell her you were sorry to leave like that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll call right now.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if that would be such a great idea.&quot; Michiru said, &quot;It&#39;s 
getting late.&quot;

Haruka nodded, &quot;Talk with her tomorrow. If she&#39;s as nice as you say, I&#39;m 
sure she&#39;ll understand.&quot;

Setsuna smiled sadly. &quot;Thank you.&quot; she said. She gave Haruka back the 
wine glass without having sipped anything from it and slowly went 
upstairs to her room.

---The Next Day---

&quot;A leave of absence?&quot; Principal Hoashi Daisuke asked as he wiped his 
glasses with a handkerchief.

&quot;Yes, Hoashi-sempai. For medical reasons.&quot; Kihomi answered glumly. 
Everything had been going so wonderfully for the teacher; she&#39;d earned 
her teacher&#39;s diploma, had landed a job, and it looked like she&#39;d found 
the love of her life. Then her date ran away, she began to hallucinate 
about voices and naked people with knives and swords cutting themselves, 
and she ended up waking up this morning behind the wheel of her car with 
dried blood clotted down her face and the sides of her neck from her 
nose and ears.

How had everything gone so wrong?

From behind his desk, the principal nodded understandingly.

&quot;Yes, I heard from the janitor Nobuhiro-san all about the incident last 
Friday.&quot; he said as he put his glasses back on, &quot;It&#39;s a shame that this 
kind of thing has to happen to a young teacher such as yourself, 
especially in her first year before she&#39;s earned tenure. We can have a 
substitute take over your classes by tomorrow, of course, but we would 
need you for today, if you think you&#39;re up to it.&quot;

&quot;Yes sempai, I&#39;m up to it.&quot; she answered. Daisuke noticed the young 
teacher&#39;s melancholy tone and quickly gave her a reassuring smile.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Saito-sama; you&#39;ll have a job when you&#39;re ready to come 
back. I promise you that. In the short time you&#39;ve been here you&#39;ve 
managed to win over both the students and the faculty. Teachers like you 
are indispensable in a school like this.&quot;

Kihomi returned the smile as she bowed in her seat, &quot;Thank you sempai.&quot; 
she said, blushing at the compliment.

&quot;Of course. Just be sure to keep us all updated as far as your health is 
concerned.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sempai. I will, sempai.&quot;

------

Rei woke up feeling miserable. There was something out there threatening 
not just her, but everyone else, and she was being ordered not to pursue 
the matter. Looking over across from her at the family shrine, she saw 
the picture of her late grandfather and frowned. Whatever was out there 
was powerful, and even if she couldn&#39;t have sought help from the old 
man, it would&#39;ve been a comfort to have him around right now.

As she walked from her bedroom to the kitchen, she could hear the sounds 
of someone frying something in a pan. Entering the room, she saw Makoto 
fixing eggs and bacon in a skillet for them.

&quot;Makoto?&quot; Rei asked, &quot;You stayed over last night?&quot;

The cook shrugged her shoulders, &quot;You looked like you could use the 
company, and I didn&#39;t have any plans for today.&quot;

Nodding, Rei looked over to the kitchen table where a paperback 
translation of Edith Hamilton&#39;s Mythology was resting. She picked up the 
book and examined it.

&quot;Is this yours?&quot; she asked.

Makoto looked over from her skillet and nodded, &quot;I was, well, reading 
about Minerva. Rei, I hate to agree with Usagi on this, but if there is 
a Sailor Minerva out there somewhere, chances are she&#39;s not the one 
attacking us.&quot;

Rei raised her eyebrow, &quot;Oh?&quot; she asked. &quot;And what makes you say that?&quot;

&quot;Minerva is the Roman name for the Goddess Athena. She was a goddess of 
war, but also of wisdom and reason. The Greeks credited her with 
protecting civilized life. It just doesn&#39;t make sense that a Senshi 
named after a goddess like that would be attacking others from a 
distance psychically, does it?&quot;

Rei just shook her head.

&quot;She&#39;s named after a goddess of war.&quot; The Shinto priestess reminded her, 
&quot;Until we come face-to-face with her, how are we to know what a &#39;Senshi 
of War&#39; would or wouldn&#39;t do? By the way, this is somewhat unusual 
reading material for you, isn&#39;t it? Where&#39;d you get it?&quot;

Makoto shrugged her shoulders as she began to dish the food out onto the 
plates. &quot;Ami loaned it to me. Why.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see.&quot; Rei said with a quirky smile. Makoto looked over to the 
priestess.

&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Mako-chan, you and Ami may have the others fooled, but you didn&#39;t 
honestly think I wasn&#39;t going to figure it out, did you?&quot;

The cook felt her breath catch in her throat, &quot;You&#39;re not going to tell, 
are you?&quot;

Rei looked hurt, &quot;What? No, of course not. But you really should tell 
the others what&#39;s going on between you two.&quot;

&quot;We plan to.&quot; Makoto said as she set the two plates down on the table, 
&quot;Just as soon as we know what&#39;s going on between us.&quot; she quipped before 
sitting down across from Rei to eat.

---Afternoon---

&quot;And tomorrow you will have a new teacher coming in for a while, while I 
go on a leave of absence for... personal reasons. I expect you all to 
treat the new teacher with the same level of respect you&#39;ve given me 
during my short stay here.&quot; As Kihomi struggled with delivering her 
speech for the fourth time that day, a hand went up. &quot;Yes Watsuki-san, 
you have a question?&quot;

The young man stood up from his desk, &quot;Sensei, how long will you be 
gone?&quot;

The teacher suddenly looked very sad. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; she admitted just 
as the bell rang for class to end. As the last student left, she turned 
away from the classroom door and sighed. If she tried to focus on 
everything that was happening to her right now, it became too 
overwhelming. Her health and her social life were in the toilet. If only 
she hadn&#39;t pushed Setsuna last night. She didn&#39;t think she was, but 
obviously she had, and in the process had driven the young woman away. 
And now...

Kihomi blocked it all out of her mind as she began erasing the 
blackboard. From behind her, she could hear the classroom door open. No 
doubt either a fellow teacher or a student had decided to say goodbye to 
her. She felt like crying. Why was this happening to her? Why now? This 
was going to be hard enough without a bunch of well wishers trying to 
cheer her up before she left. With a resigned sigh she turned to see who 
it was.

There, standing in the doorframe to her classroom, stood Setsuna.

&quot;Hello.&quot; Setsuna offered weakly. She couldn&#39;t bring herself to look at 
those beautiful grey eyes staring back at her. She was too afraid of the 
look of anger she felt sure was waiting for her there.

&quot;Hello.&quot; Kihomi offered back. She sadly noted that the attractive woman 
in front of her was avoiding eye contact. She bit her lower lip as she 
waited for her to say whatever she felt needed to be said. As she 
watched, Setsuna shifted her weight from one shapely leg to the other.

&quot;May I come in?&quot; the Senshi nervously asked. Kihomi nodded as she 
motioned for her to enter. As Setsuna walked in, the teacher walked over 
to the door and locked it. She then lowered the blind on the door&#39;s 
glass window and turned to see Setsuna watching her silently from in 
front of the large desk at the front of the room.

&quot;So.&quot; the Senshi muttered.

&quot;So.&quot; Kihomi answered back.

In the awkward silence that followed, the teacher watched as the woman 
fidgeted a bit with her jacket sleeve. Setsuna then stared down at the 
tile floor.

&quot;I overheard outside the door. You... You&#39;re leaving?&quot;

Kihomi took a deep breath, &quot;Yes, for a little while.&quot; she answered.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Setsuna said flatly. Now it was Kihomi&#39;s turn to look away as she 
rubbed the back of her head with her hand.

&quot;Look, Setsuna, about last night...&quot;

&quot;You must hate me, don&#39;t you?&quot;

The teacher was caught completely off guard by the question. Setsuna 
looked up from the floor as tears started to form at the corners of her 
violet eyes.

&quot;I... I can&#39;t say that I blame you. I never meant to leave you like 
that, to run away and hurt you. I didn&#39;t want to go. You have to believe 
me, Kihomi... I wanted to stay with you. I&#39;ve... never felt this way 
about anyone before. You&#39;re sweet and compassionate and... and...&quot; she 
paused as a tear ran down her cheek, &quot;Please don&#39;t turn me away.&quot; she 
whispered, &quot;I... I&#39;ve been so alone for so long. I&#39;m sorry. Please 
don&#39;t... leave... because of me...&quot;

Setsuna was cut off as Kihomi crossed the room and took her in her arms. 
As she held her the shorter woman buried her head in her shoulder. She 
could feel Setsuna softly shudder as she began to weep. She started to 
run her fingers through the woman&#39;s long, silky hair as she held her 
close.

&quot;Shhh...&quot; Kihomi whispered, &quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not leaving because of you. 
Honest&quot;

Setsuna looked into Kihomi&#39;s kind face. The teacher gently wiped away 
her tears with her index finger.

&quot;And... And I thought all this time you were upset with me.&quot; Kihomi said 
as she stroked the Senshi&#39;s cheek. &quot;I was afraid I was the one who drove 
you away.&quot;

Setsuna looked at the other woman in surprise. &quot;Really?&quot; she asked.

The teacher nodded. &quot;Setsuna, you&#39;re the most wonderful woman I&#39;ve ever 
met. You&#39;re incredibly intelligent, you have a beautiful laugh, and a 
lovely personality. When you rushed off yesterday, I was afraid that I&#39;d 
pushed you away.&quot;

Setsuna looked at her questioningly. &quot;Then why are you going on a leave 
of absence?&quot;

Kihomi swallowed hard, &quot;Medical reasons.&quot; she admitted.

The Senshi pulled away and looked at her in alarm, &quot;Medical reasons? 
What kind of medical reasons? Kihomi, what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;I... I wish I knew.&quot; The teacher said sadly, &quot;I&#39;ve been having these 
incredibly severe migraines for the last three nights. No, not 
migraines; more than migraines. Yesterday and last Friday there... there 
was blood as well, coming from my nose and ears. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a 
possible aneurism or maybe a tumor, but the local hospital can&#39;t find 
anything. And now...&quot; Kihomi hesitated before going on, &quot;Now I&#39;m 
starting to hallucinate during the attacks. I can&#39;t go on like this, I 
just can&#39;t. There&#39;s supposed to be a good hospital in Nagoya. Hopefully 
they can tell me what&#39;s going on.&quot;

Setsuna felt her heart sink for the woman in front of her. &quot;You... You 
had another one of these attacks last night?&quot;

Kihomi nodded glumly, &quot;Just after you left.&quot; she said.

The guilt-ridden Senshi shook her head as she looked at the teacher. &quot;I 
should&#39;ve been there.&quot; she said, &quot;I should&#39;ve stayed.&quot; She&#39;d always felt 
the obligations of being the Senshi of Time, of having to watch over the 
timegate, but she&#39;d never felt it to be such a painful burden until now. 
Kihomi had been in pain, suffering intensely, and she&#39;d been unable to 
help her.

The other woman put her index finger under Setsuna&#39;s chin as she gently 
stroked the soft skin under her jaw.

&quot;You didn&#39;t know, Setsuna.&quot; Kihomi said, her grey eyes full of 
compassion, &quot;Don&#39;t beat yourself up about this.&quot; she added as she kissed 
her on the forehead. Setsuna responded by kissing her on the cheek.

Both women could feel the mood in the room change.

Kihomi returned the kiss, lightly pecking Setsuna on her cheek, and 
tasking the saltiness that her tears had left behind. The Senshi then 
pressed her lips to Kihomi&#39;s.

The teacher deepened the kiss even as she maneuvered Setsuna back toward 
her desk in front of the blackboard. As the Senshi felt her rear bump up 
against the desk, Kihomi broke away from her lips and began to kiss her 
throat.

&quot;When... aaaaaa... When are you leaving?&quot; Setsuna managed to get out.

&quot;Tomorrow morning.&quot; Kihomi answered as she brought her lips up to the 
other woman&#39;s ear, &quot;It&#39;ll only be for a little while. For the rest of 
today though, I&#39;m all yours.&quot; she whispered as she flicked the Senshi&#39;s 
earlobe with her tongue before sucking on it. Setsuna let out a low deep 
moan from the back of her throat as she wrapped her right leg around 
Kihomi, sitting on the edge of the desk as she did so.

They brought their lips together again. Kihomi kept one hand behind the 
Senshi&#39;s head as she brought her other hand down to grip the woman&#39;s 
right hip. The sudden sensation caused Setsuna to take in a quick breath 
as she began to feel a heat rising up within her. As the Time Senshi 
lost herself in the sudden flood of new sensations coursing through her 
body, Kihomi opened her eyes a crack to look at the wall clock.

&quot;Setsuna-chan.&quot; Kihomi whispered as she broke the kiss, &quot;My next class 
starts soon.&quot; she said sadly.

Setsuna looked at her with a pained expression for a second or two 
before nodding her head.

&quot;I... I understand.&quot; she answered. Kihomi stroked her cheek as she 
reached into her pocket for a tissue and quickly wiped off the lipstick 
smudges from Setsuna&#39;s face.

&quot;I only have three more classes. After that, I&#39;m all yours. Honest.&quot;

Setsuna smiled at her as they both separated. From her purse she pulled 
out the same small notebook she&#39;d used two days ago at the mall and 
wrote down her home address. She then ripped the page out and handed it 
over to the teacher.

&quot;Come over after classes.&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting for you.&quot; Kihomi 
took the slip and smiled at the woman giving it to her.

&quot;I will. I promise.&quot; she said as she showed the beautiful young woman to 
the door. After she left, Kihomi raced to her desk, pulled out her 
compact from her purse, and fixed up her hair and makeup just in time 
for the next class.

------

The smell of the sea was coming in from the harbor, filling her 
nostrils. She walked by a drunk who was passed out sleeping next to a 
garbage can and two teenage boys looking through a stolen pornographic 
magazine as she came to the entrance. Entering, she found one of the 
female members of the circle shooting up as another member, completely 
ignoring the junkie, played solitaire with a pack of tarot cards.

Walking past the large machine of Professor Miyagawa, Beniko came to a 
back room in the giant warehouse. Opening the door, she saw the redhead 
curled up on the couch, using her leather jacket as a makeshift blanket. 
The plan had been so simple; she&#39;d made out the contract, signing it in 
her own blood. Marika would help until the new Senshi was found, and 
then she would use the Senshi&#39;s power to break the contract.

So how had this happened?

How had she fallen in love with the redhead?

Marika sniffed the air before yawning, her forked tongue clearly visible 
in her open mouth. Opening her eyes a bit, she smiled as she saw Beniko. 
As the blond came over, she sat up to give her room to sit on the couch. 
Beniko took the offered spot, pulling Marika&#39;s head back down so she 
could use her lap as a pillow. As she ran her fingers through the 
woman&#39;s red hair and heard her softly purr, she frowned.

It had been so simple.

Exactly when had it become so complicated?

------

Hotaru got off the bus and ran over to her house where Haruka&#39;s 
convertible sat parked in the driveway, her papa looking over the engine 
under the hood. At the sounds of her footsteps, the sandy-blond turned 
around.

&quot;Hey firefly.&quot; she greeted with a smile.

&quot;Hey papa&quot; Hotaru answered, &quot;Any luck yet on finding the tenth Senshi?&quot;

&quot;No, and I wish everyone would stop referring to her as &#39;the tenth.&#39; I 
mean, Galaxia was a Senshi, and so was Princess Kakyuu and her three pet 
idiots, remember?&quot;

Hotaru rolled her eyes, &quot;You know what we all mean, papa.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. So, you ready to learn that &#39;grease monkey stuff&#39;?&quot;

Hotaru mock pouted, &quot;I&#39;d hoped you&#39;d forgotten about that oil change 
stuff.&quot; she said.

&quot;No such luck. Get some beat-up old clothes on and get back out here.&quot; 
Haruka said as she sat down on a creeper lying next to the car.

Hotaru smiled as she ran inside to change. For all her teasing, she&#39;d 
been looking forward to this time together with her papa as much as 
Haruka was. The two shared a very special father-daughter type of 
relationship, and both cherished these moments when the Formula-one 
racecar driver was able to set aside time just to bond with the junior 
high student.

As Hotaru closed the door behind her and Haruka pushed herself 
underneath the vehicle, a car pulled up to the house, parking next to 
the curb in front of the lawn. Haruka, who was under the car and hadn&#39;t 
heard the other vehicle pull up, now heard footsteps in the driveway 
close by.

&quot;That was fast.&quot; she mumbled to herself as she reached for the drain 
pan. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; she called out from under the car.

Kihomi stopped dead in her tracks, afraid that she was hearing voices 
and another attack was imminent. She did a quick survey of her body and 
realized there was no intense pain this time.

&quot;Bring the toolbox over, and grab the extra creeper for yourself.&quot;

She looked down to see a pair or legs sticking out from underneath the 
vehicle next to her and put her hand on her chest as she took a quick 
breath of relief. Looking around, she found the toolbox and creeper in 
question lying near a bird bath in the lawn and brought them over.

&quot;Well, don&#39;t just stand there. Grab the socket set and the filter 
wrench, and then get under here with me already.&quot;

Kihomi raised her eyebrow at that. Setsuna had told her a bit about 
Haruka, her love for cars, and her quirky sense of humor. She didn&#39;t 
know how she was expected to take this call for help. She didn&#39;t want to 
get her suit dirty, but at the same time she didn&#39;t want Setsuna&#39;s 
friends or family to think of her as a stuffed shirt either. Removing a 
scrunchie from her pocket, she tied her hair up, took the socket set and 
the oil filter wrench Haruka had requested and lay down on the creeper. 
As three pairs of eyes watched from the living room window, Kihomi 
pushed herself under the vehicle next to Haruka.

The blond took out the socket handle from the box offered her and held 
it up to the undercarriage. &quot;This is the drain plug.&quot; she said, using 
the handle as a pointer, &quot;This is the oil filter, and this is the drain 
pan. Now, what do you do first?&quot;

&quot;First you put the drain pan under the drain plug, then you unscrew the 
plug and let the old oil flow into the pan, then you change the oil 
filter, re-screw the plug back in, and fill the vehicle with new oil.&quot;

Haruka turned to the speaker with a surprised look. &quot;Saito-sama?&quot; she 
asked, &quot;What are you doing under here?&quot;

Kihomi smiled, &quot;You told me to bring over the tools and the creeper 
to...&quot;

Haruka started to laugh, &quot;That&#39;s because I thought you were Hotaru.&quot; she 
said.

Kihomi started to giggle as well, &quot;Oh, I see. Well, Setsuna had told me 
about your sense of humor, so when I heard you tell me to come under 
here, I thought...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t drag me into this.&quot; a voice said from above. Both women pushed 
themselves out from under the car to see Setsuna, Hotaru and Michiru 
smirking down at them.

Ten minutes later, after everyone had stopped laughing, Michiru went 
back into the house as Haruka and Hotaru went underneath the 
convertible. Setsuna got into the passenger seat of Kihomi&#39;s car next to 
the teacher as she started up the vehicle.

&quot;So,&quot; Kihomi said, &quot;You have me for the rest of the day. Where do you 
want to go?&quot;

Setsuna thought for a second. This blissful feeling she felt with 
Kihomi; was she really allowed it as the Time Senshi? Closing her eyes, 
she stretched out her consciousness looking for an answer. The response 
she got back from the fates was completely unexpected. No condemnations, 
no disapproval, no reproof to her relationship with the teacher. 
Instead, she received a very different response from the fates.

Joy.

More than joy; a feeling of a long overdue happiness, as if she and 
Kihomi had always been meant for one another, but somehow had been kept 
apart until now. The fates smiled happily upon her and her relationship.

She opened her eyes again and smiled at the woman next to her, happier 
than she&#39;d ever felt.

&quot;Your place.&quot; she finally answered, &quot;I... I want to go to your place.&quot;

Kihomi felt her heart skip a beat. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asked.

Setsuna nodded with a smile, &quot;I&#39;ve never been so sure of anything in my 
life.&quot; she replied.

Kihomi smiled as she nodded. A few seconds later, the car had pulled out 
from the curb into traffic as the two women headed to the teacher&#39;s 
apartment.
