<h1>A Beach Story</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello! ^^ This is a Sekkushiaru Roman about Hotaru and ChibiUsa.
They are both 15 in this story and its part of the continuity
we have with most of our other stories. Basically all of our 
stories use the same continuity except the very early ones. 
This takes place after &#39;Moonlit Nights&#39;, we just haven&#39;t 
finished it yet. ^^ Hopefully we&#39;ll be done soon. Anyway, we&#39;d 
like to thank those of you who read this and if you could 
e-mail us we&#39;d love to hear from you. ^^ 

We hope you enjoy the story. Bye! ^-^

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Wow!&quot; ChibiUsa exclaimed as she stepped out of 
Haruka&#39;s car.
	Hotaru smiled as she followed the enthusiastic pink
haired girl out. &quot;I&#39;m glad you like it. I came up here with 
my dad almost every summer. This was our beach house. My 
dad gave it to us the last time we saw him. He said that I
should come down here sometime.&quot; 
	&quot;So here we are,&quot; Haruka leaned against the car as
Michiru and Setsuna got out. She pulled the sun glasses she
was wearing down a bit. &quot;It&#39;s a nice place.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Michiru said. She took off Haruka&#39;s
sunglasses and put them on. She smiled at Haruka. &quot;Help me 
get the luggage. I want to go down to the beach as soon as we
can.&quot;
	&quot;Are you sure there are enough rooms?&quot; Setsuna asked.
	&quot;Sure. It was just me and dad when I used to come up
here, but there should be plenty of room. ChibiUsa can sleep
with me,&quot; Hotaru answered.
	Haruka unlocked the trunk. All five girls grabbed 
luggage and headed for the beach house. Hotaru was breathing
heavily by the time they reached the door. 
	&quot;Hotaru-chan, are you okay?&quot; ChibiUsa asked. 
	Hotaru nodded. &quot;I&#39;m fine...&quot; Hotaru hefted the 
suitcase she was carrying. She was stronger in this life than
she&#39;d been before, but she was still very weak.
	&quot;Hime-chan, be careful not to overexert yourself,&quot;
Setsuna chided. &quot;If you need us to get the rest of the 
luggage, just tell us.&quot;
	&quot;Hai, Setsuna-mama,&quot; Hotaru answered.
	Michiru unlocked the door and they all walked in. The
group of women looked around as they entered. Memories 
returned to Hotaru of happy summers spent there with her 
father. She blinked several times as tears built up in her 
eyes. It had been so long since she had been there last, but 
it was the same as it had been years ago.
	&quot;Hotaru-chan?&quot; ChibiUsa asked concerned.
	Hotaru blinked again and smiled warmly at ChibiUsa. 
She took the other girl&#39;s hand in her own. &quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m just 
remembering a lot, that&#39;s all.&quot; ChibiUsa gave her hand a quick 
squeeze. Hotaru&#39;s fingers intertwined with ChibiUsa&#39;s as the 
two girls looked at the interior of the beach house.
	&quot;Hmmm... We&#39;ll have to make at least another trip to 
the car. Let&#39;s leave what we&#39;ve already got here. We can take 
them to the rooms later,&quot; Setsuna said as she put the luggage
she was holding by the door. The rest of the girls quickly 
followed.
	&quot;That sounds good. Then we can see the rooms and find 
out who sleeps where.&quot; Michiru yawned from the long drive.
	Haruka smiled. &quot;Maybe you should stay here and sleep 
while we go down to the beach.&quot;
	&quot;And miss one of my few chances to see you in a bikini? 
I&#39;m not going to sleep until after I see that.&quot; Michiru 
giggled.
	The three other girls stood in silence for a moment 
before Setsuna spoke up. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get the rest of the 
luggage and then we&#39;ll head to the beach.&quot;
	&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Michiru said smiling. 
	They returned to the car to get the rest of their 
things.

	Hotaru pulled her bathing suit up past her legs. It was 
a black one piece. ChibiUsa was sitting on the bed in front of 
Hotaru. She was blushing a she watched the girl dress. It was 
only halfway on, so ChibiUsa had a good view of Hotaru&#39;s 
breasts. 
	&quot;ChibiUsa-chan, are you okay?&quot; Hotaru asked. She 
smiled. She enjoyed being able to affect the pink haired girl 
the way she did. ChibiUsa affected her much the same way. It 
was so different than the looks she had received from ChibiUsa
several months before. 
	&quot;Hai,&quot; ChibiUsa nodded. 
	&quot;Good. Can you help me?&quot; Hotaru pulled the bathing suit 
the rest of the way up and put the strings over her shoulders. 
&quot;Can you tie it for me?&quot;
	ChibiUsa walked over and tied the string behind Hotaru&#39;s
neck. Hotaru was about to walk towards the door when she felt 
ChibiUsa&#39;s hand slide beneath her bathing suit. The tight cloth 
pushed ChibiUsa&#39;s hand close to her body. ChibiUsa cupped one of
Hotaru&#39;s breasts under the thin fabric. Hotaru let out a light 
moan as she felt the other girl squeeze her breast. ChibiUsa 
started kissing her shoulder. 
	&quot;Od...Odango-chan....&quot; Hotaru said quietly.
	They froze when they heard a knock at the door. The 
door knob slowly turned and the door was pushed open. ChibiUsa 
quickly pulled her hand out from underneath Hotaru&#39;s bathing 
suit. Both girls were blushing profusely.
	&quot;Hi, Michiru-mama,&quot; Hotaru said quickly.
	&quot;Are you two almost ready?&quot; Michiru asked. 
	They both nodded. &quot;We&#39;re ready,&quot; ChibiUsa responded.
	&quot;Okay. Then let&#39;s go. Haruka and Setsuna are waiting,&quot; 
she smiled and led them out of the room.
	&quot;I should have changed in the bathroom. It&#39;s safer 
there,&quot; Hotaru whispered to ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Only if you&#39;d have let me change with you,&quot; ChibiUsa 
whispered back impishly. 
	Hotaru turned around as they walked out of the house, 
trying to get a good view of it. She smiled as she recalled the
happy memories she associated with it. ChibiUsa called for her
after a couple seconds. Hotaru ran to catch up to the two other
girls. 
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Haruka and Setsuna were already on the beach by the time
they arrived. Michiru smiled as she ran up to Haruka. Sure 
enough, the tall blonde was wearing the bikini Michiru had 
bought for her. It was dark blue and fit the contours of her 
body well. Haruka blushed and coughed into her fist as Michiru 
tugged a bit at the material, trying to make it fit better. 
	&quot;Michi...&quot; Haruka said as she took a step back.
	&quot;Haruka, you look beautiful in it. Now let me help you. 
Its not on completely right,&quot; Michiru replied.
	Haruka sighed. She stood as Michiru adjusted it. &quot;I knew
I should have bought my own swimsuit.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t. Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t have been 
able to get this one,&quot; Michiru said.
	&quot;Exactly,&quot; Haruka put her hands behind her head as 
Michiru stepped away.
	&quot;Perfect,&quot; Michiru said as she studied both the bikini 
and the fit woman beneath.
	Hotaru giggled as she listened to the exchange between
two of her parents. She turned to spot ChibiUsa. She saw the 
pink haired girl spreading out a towel on the sand. &quot;Need any
help, ChibiUsa-chan?&quot; Hotaru asked.
	&quot;No, I&#39;m fine. Just lie on the towel. You need some 
sun tan lotion if we&#39;re going to be out here long,&quot; ChibiUsa 
said.
	&quot;Since when were you so health conscious?&quot; Hotaru asked
as she complied. &quot;Or does it serve some other purpose, like 
what happened when we were changing?&quot; 
	&quot;Maybe,&quot; ChibiUsa said and laughed. &quot;Actually, you&#39;ve 
got pretty pale skin and I was worried you&#39;d get sunburned.&quot; 
ChibiUsa started to rub the cold lotion on all of Hotaru&#39;s 
exposed skin. Hotaru closed her eyes. They heard splashing 
coming from the water.
	Hotaru sighed happily as she felt ChibiUsa&#39;s hands 
moving across her skin. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked.
	ChibiUsa squinted as she looked towards the beach. &quot;I 
think they&#39;re having a water fight. Setsuna and Haruka are 
teaming up on Michiru.&quot;
	&quot;Poor Michiru-mama.&quot;
	&quot;You could always go help her,&quot; ChibiUsa suggested.
	&quot;Maybe later. It&#39;s your turn,&quot; Hotaru got up as ChibiUsa
took her place on the towel lying on her stomach. Hotaru 
brushed some hair out of her eyes and looked to the water. She 
could still hear the splashing, but she could barely see 
Setsuna, Michiru, and Haruka anymore. She smiled as she grabbed
the suntan lotion. &quot;I want you to relax, Odango-chan.&quot;
	ChibiUsa nodded as she closed her eyes. She stretched 
out on the towel. She was tired after the drive up there and 
lying on the towel felt great after being in the car for so 
long. Her eyes closed as she started to drift off. She felt 
Hotaru&#39;s hands rubbing the lotion into her skin. She continued 
to drift off as she lay there. She was brought back as she felt
Hotaru&#39;s hands moving under her bathing suit. She shivered as 
she felt Hotaru start to rub the cold lotion onto her right 
breast. ChibiUsa rolled over and looked up at Hotaru. The dark 
haired girl smiled evilly. &quot;Hotaru-chan, what are you doing?&quot; 
ChibiUsa asked.
	&quot;I want to make sure you don&#39;t get sunburned,&quot; Hotaru 
said innocently. She put some more lotion on her hand and ran
it over ChibiUsa&#39;s exposed stomach. Her hand continued to go
lower until it had slipped beneath the fabric of the bathing 
suit. ChibiUsa tried to remain calm, but Hotaru&#39;s touch was
exciting her greatly. &quot;Hotaru, we shouldn&#39;t do that here,&quot; she
managed.
	Hotaru looked at her and smiled. &quot;I know. I don&#39;t plan
on doing anything. I just want to make sure that I get the
suntan lotion everywhere.&quot;
	ChibiUsa tried to breath deeply as Hotaru worked the 
lotion in under her bathing suit. The sleep she had been 
drifting towards earlier was now far from her mind. 
	&quot;Okay. Now roll over. I need to get your other side,&quot;
Hotaru said.
	ChibiUsa rolled onto her chest. She giggled. &quot;This 
isn&#39;t fair. I want you to have your turn over again.&quot;
	&quot;Yes it is. This is for what happened when I was 
changing.&quot; Hotaru said as she started to massage ChibiUsa&#39;s
shoulders. 
	&quot;That wasn&#39;t my fault. I had to watch you change,&quot;
ChibiUsa said in defense. She started to move when she felt
Hotaru&#39;s hand slip under the bottom half of her bathing 
suit again. Hotaru gently pushed her back down. 
	&quot;I had to watch you change, too. And as I recall, I 
kept my hands to myself,&quot; Hotaru said. 
	ChibiUsa was silent for a moment. Hotaru pinched her.
&quot;Owwww...&quot; 
	&quot;See. I win,&quot; Hotaru said triumphantly.
	&quot;I don&#39;t mind as long as we discuss what you&#39;ve won
back at the beach house.&quot; ChibiUsa turned over so she could
see Hotaru.
	&quot;You&#39;re pretty anxious about it. I am, too, but you&#39;ll
have to wait until later. It&#39;s been a long time since I was 
last here and I want to wander around the beach.&quot; Hotaru 
brushed a hand through ChibiUsa&#39;s soft, pink hair.
	ChibiUsa pouted. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t tease me like that.&quot;
	&quot;I know. But you&#39;re so cute when I do.&quot;
	&quot;Hotaru...&quot; ChibiUsa chided.
	Hotaru leaned down. Her lips met ChibiUsa&#39;s for 
several seconds before she sat up. ChibiUsa sat up as well
and gave the dark haired girl a deep kiss. Her arms went 
around Hotaru&#39;s waist as her tongue dueled with Hotaru&#39;s. 	
	Several minutes later both girls sat out of breath.
	&quot;Maybe we should go back to the beach house,&quot; Hotaru
said after a moment of silence. 
	ChibiUsa sighed and leaned her head on Hotaru&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;This is really nice, Taru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said as
she looked across the beach.
	&quot;Isn&#39;t it? I used to love coming here with my dad when
I was younger. He was always so busy, but he&#39;d always make the
time to come down here.&quot;
	&quot;Do you miss him?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.
	&quot;Yeah. Sometimes. But I have Michiru-mama, 
Setsuna-mama, and Haruka-papa now. I wouldn&#39;t want to give 
them up for anything.&quot; Hotaru looked at the distant figures of 
her three parents in the distance. 
	ChibiUsa stood up. She grabbed Hotaru&#39;s hand and helped
her up. &quot;Come on. You wanted to enjoy the beach, so let&#39;s. I&#39;m
sure Michiru still needs our help.&quot;
	Hotaru hugged the pink haired girl. &quot;Thanks, 
Odango-chan.&quot; ChibiUsa hugged her back before they ran towards 
the water.

	ChibiUsa sat up in bed. She blinked a couple times to
adjust her vision to the darkness. The open window let in the
moonlight and illuminated the room for her to make out slight 
details. She saw Hotaru standing by the window. The moonlight
gave glimpses of Hotaru&#39;s naked body. ChibiUsa was still 
wearing her pajamas, but she knew that Hotaru didn&#39;t wear 
anything when she slept. ChibiUsa blushed as she gazed at her
lover. She got up and stood beside Hotaru. 
	Hotaru turned to ChibiUsa. &quot;I thought you were asleep.
Did I wake you?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m glad I did, though. What are you 
thinking about?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.
	&quot;A lot of things. Mostly just about other times I was 
here,&quot; Hotaru answered.
	ChibiUsa nodded. &quot;It must be strange being here again.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m glad. I&#39;ve been wanting to come back for a 
while now. I like having my parents and you here. I can make 
new memories here instead of dwelling on the old ones,&quot; Hotaru 
said. She gave ChibiUsa a quick kiss.
	&quot;What type of memories do you have in mind?&quot; ChibiUsa
asked innocently. 
	Hotaru looked out the window again. &quot;I was going to go
out to the beach right now. Will you come with me?&quot;
	&quot;Okay. That sounds good. It&#39;s kind of late, don&#39;t you
think?&quot;
	&quot;Yes, I do. It looks nice.&quot; Hotaru grabbed ChibiUsa&#39;s
hand and led her out of the room. 
	ChibiUsa stared shocked at Hotaru&#39;s bare body. &quot;Don&#39;t 
we need our bathing suits first?&quot; 
	Hotaru smiled at her. &quot;Nope. Haven&#39;t you ever gone 
skinny dipping?&quot;
	&quot;No,&quot; ChibiUsa answered. &quot;Have you?&quot;
	&quot;Not really. It sounds fun, though,&quot; Hotaru said.
	&quot;Don&#39;t we need towels?&quot;
	&quot;Odango-chan, you worry too much,&quot; Hotaru whispered to
her as she opened the door. The two girls walked out into the
warm night air.
	They reached the water&#39;s edge and stopped. ChibiUsa
looked at the sea water as it splashed along the beach. &quot;You
go ahead. I&#39;ll watch. It looks cold.&quot;
	&quot;ChibiUsa-chan...&quot; Hotaru said pleadingly.
	ChibiUsa sighed nervously and started unbuttoning her
pajama top. She put her pajamas on the beach towel she&#39;d left 
there earlier. The pink haired girl stood there for several 
seconds to adjust to the gentle breeze blowing across her body.
&quot;I hope Setsuna and the others don&#39;t get up.&quot;
	&quot;Just think about trying to explain it,&quot; Hotaru said.
&quot;Come on, ChibiUsa. Check the water.&quot;
	&quot;It looks too cold,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	Hotaru dipped her foot in the water. &quot;It&#39;s not bad.&quot;
She took a step further in. She shivered at first but continued
walking. &quot;See? Now you try.&quot;
	ChibiUsa hesitated for a moment before walking in. She
went faster than Hotaru had in an attempt to get it over with
all at once. ChibiUsa hugged herself to try and stay warm. &quot;It
was a lot better this afternoon.&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s more peaceful now,&quot; Hotaru said.
	&quot;And its just us,&quot; ChibiUsa said as she swam near 
Hotaru.
	The two girls talked for a long time while the swam,
enjoying each others presence. While Hotaru was swimming,
ChibiUsa finally got out and walked over to the beach towel. 
She sat down quickly, the cold water dripping off her body.
	&quot;ChibiUsa?&quot; Hotaru got out of the water and walked over
to the pink haired girl. She shivered as she stood there. 
	&quot;It&#39;s too cold in the water,&quot; ChibiUsa said as she lay
down on the beach towel to dry off.
	&quot;It&#39;s too cold out here,&quot; Hotaru said when a breeze
started up. 
	&quot;Should we go in?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.
	Hotaru shook her head. &quot;Not yet. I think I know what 
would warm us up.&quot; She kneeled by ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Taru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said quietly. They kissed as Hotaru
lay atop ChibiUsa. ChibiUsa could feel one of Hotaru&#39;s breasts
pressed against her own. Her nipples were hard from the cold 
water and now the wind. Hotaru and ChibiUsa rolled over several
times with Hotaru ending up on the sandy beach. ChibiUsa kissed
down her jaw line while she cupped Hotaru&#39;s breasts. ChibiUsa 
began rubbing Hotaru&#39;s nipples softly at first. 
	Hotaru moaned as she felt ChibiUsa&#39;s hands against her 
breasts. Her hand went up along ChibiUsa&#39;s side before pushing
against the other girl&#39;s breast. Hotaru moved her head downward
and started kissing ChibiUsa&#39;s other breast. She could taste the
salty sea water that was still dripping off of their bodies. 
ChibiUsa let out a gasp as she felt Hotaru&#39;s mouth around one
of her nipples. Hotaru licked it at first before she started 
to suckle the pink haired girl. 
	One of ChibiUsa&#39;s hands left Hotaru&#39;s breasts and 
started to descend over the dark haired girl&#39;s body. The tips
of her fingers gently caressed Hotaru&#39;s stomach as they 
continued down. Hotaru felt ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers move over her
already swollen nether lips. A moan escaped her lips as ChibiUsa
parted her labia. She could feel the tip of ChibiUsa&#39;s finger 
slide into her vagina. Hotaru moved her head to ChibiUsa&#39;s other
breast and began to suckle her nipple. Hotaru&#39;s free hand 
roamed ChibiUsa&#39;s back. ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers brushed along 
Hotaru&#39;s labia again. Hotaru shuddered visibly after ChibiUsa 
found her clitoris. ChibiUsa stroked the dark haired girl&#39;s 
jewel as other hand slid along Hotaru&#39;s bare side.
	Hotaru could feel the heat building up inside her as
she moaned ChibiUsa&#39;s name. She could feel her climax coming.
Her hand mover way from ChibiUsa&#39;s breast and down between her
legs. She began to rub the pink haired girl&#39;s vagina. Hotaru
could feel herself reaching climax. She moaned as she reached 
it, her mind losing all conscious thought for a few blissful
seconds. 
	Hotaru lay still for a few moments. She saw ChibiUsa
sitting by her, licking her fingers clean. Hotaru sat up. She 
took some deep breaths to stop her heavy breathing. &quot;Your turn,
ChibiUsa-chan.&quot;
	ChibiUsa smiled and kissed her. &quot;We keep taking turns 
today, don&#39;t we?&quot;
	Hotaru had ChibiUsa lie down on the towel. The pink 
haired girl gladly obeyed. Hotaru positioned herself so her 
legs were on either side of ChibiUsa&#39;s head. She pushed 
ChibiUsa&#39;s legs apart. Her tongue ran over ChibiUsa&#39;s nether
lips, causing the pink haired girl to squirm under Hotaru. 
Hotaru licked ChibiUsa&#39;s swollen labia before using her fingers
to part them. She started licking inside ChibiUsa, her tongue
sliding into ChibiUsa&#39;s vagina. The future princess moaned as
the purple haired girl continued to lick her. ChibiUsa&#39;s nose
brushed the other girl&#39;s still sensitive lips. She began to
mimic Hotaru&#39;s movements with her own tongue. ChibiUsa started
panting as she started moving her hips against Hotaru&#39;s invading
tongue. She was panting heavily. 
	Hotaru felt ChibiUsa&#39;s tongue lick her clitoris before
moving on. Hotaru involuntarily brought her legs closer 
together, bringing ChibiUsa&#39;s head closer to her vagina. Hotaru
felt the sensations increase as ChibiUsa added a finger into 
her vagina. ChibiUsa felt the dark haired girl licking her more
voraciously. ChibiUsa couldn&#39;t last much longer. She arched her
back as she reached orgasm. 
	Hotaru was taking quick, shallow breaths as she felt 
ChibiUsa continue. Hotaru moaned again before she climaxed a 
second time. 
	Hotaru rolled off of ChibiUsa and snuggled against her.
&quot;I told you it would be fun out here.&quot; Her arms went around
ChibiUsa. Her dark purple eyes met gentle crimson ones. The sky 
was a light pink from the rising sun. &quot;How long have we been 
out here?&quot; she asked.
	&quot;We should get back in,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	&quot;Do you want to?&quot; Hotaru asked.
	&quot;No,&quot; ChibiUsa replied. The girls smiled. 
	&quot;Let&#39;s wash up first, then we&#39;ll go in later,&quot; Hotaru 
said grinning. 
	&quot;That sounds good.&quot; ChibiUsa kissed the raven haired 
girl again. They both walked back to the water&#39;s edge. The water
didn&#39;t seem as cold as they washed each other off. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hotaru looked back at the beach house. She&#39;d had a lot
of great memories of it and after this weekend she had even 
more. She smiled a bit as she looked over to the beach one last
time before they left. She knew seh&#39;d be back, but she still
didn&#39;t want to leave. She felt a hand grab her own. She squeezed
ChibiUsa&#39;s hand and turned to her. 
	&quot;Is everybody ready?&quot; Haruka asked from the car. 
	Hotaru turned back to the beach house to see it once 
more before walking back to the car. She smiled again, this time
happier. She&#39;d be back. And she&#39;d be able to make more memories
for this place she treasured.
