<p>Professor Souichi Tomoe frowned as he pulled the sheets of his bed  back. Today had not been a total waste of time. After all, he had been  able to offer the Mistress a pure young heart crystal. And Zultan had  managed to infiltrate into what she claimed to be a prime source of  pure hearts.</p>
<p>But that was not what he'd sent the young witch out  to do. He needed the Grail, and to obtain the Grail he needed the three  talismans.</p>
<p>Perhaps Kaolinite was right. Perhaps he should've  handed the task over to her instead of to the young witch. With a yawn,  he decided that for the moment such considerations could wait. If  Zultan didn't come through soon though, he would turn things over to  Kaolinite. And no doubt after he made a necessary example of Zultan the  Witches Six would become the Witches Five.</p>
<p>Professor Tomoe turned off the lights and crawled into bed.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Ever  since she could remember, Michiru has had a love affair with the ocean.  Her earliest memories were of her mother's beach house, playing on the  shore and collecting seashells. When she was six, her mother took her  out on a boat with other tourists to go whale watching. Gigantic,  majestic and, to the youngster watching, almost all powerful, they both  terrified and attracted her at the same time. It had filled her with a  sense of awe which nothing before or since had ever been able to  compare to.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>&quot;Pluto?&quot; Michiru asked. &quot;Wait a minute, Pluto was the god of the underworld. Then... Then am I in...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Pluto quickly interrupted. &quot;You are still very much alive, and this is no land of the dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru allowed a small sigh of relief to escape her.</p>
<p>&quot;I  am not the god or goddess of any underworld. I am the Guardian of the  Time Gate, charged with the administration of temporal affairs. Do you  understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I'm not in Hell, yes,&quot; Michiru answered, the  young teen still sitting on the ground. &quot;I also get the feeling that,  although you're no doubt quite powerful, I'm in no danger at the  moment. But other than that no, I don't understand.&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto smiled slightly. &quot;That 'feeling' you have is part of your awakening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here,&quot;  she responded as she held her hand out, &quot;Let me help you up. Do you  remember two days ago when you saw that strange girl in the red mask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean Sailor V?&quot; Michiru asked, noting as Pluto lifted her that she was stronger than she looked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sailor V. Sailor V is a Sailor Senshi, just as I am. And just as you are.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru's eyes widened. &quot;Me?&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto  took a deep breath. &quot;I can better understand Serenity's decision now.  Such news is better coming from a cat. More subtle, less threatening,  with the added advantage of being almost whimsical.&quot; Ignoring Michiru's  confused and questioning gaze she continued, &quot;But as I've already said,  we haven't much time, and thus I don't have the extravagance of a cat's  subtlety at my disposal. Michiru, a new age is coming, but what kind of  era it will be depends upon us, the Sailor Senshi. The Earth is about  to be caught in a series of conflicts against enemies both new and  centuries old.&quot;</p>
<p>She turned away from Michiru and began to walk  towards something partially obscured by mist. Michiru followed. &quot;Wait,  please, I... I think there's been some sort of a mistake. I'm no  warrior...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twelve thousand years ago, I pulled this from the  cold fingers of someone very close and dear to me,&quot; Pluto said, turning  around with something wrapped in rotting leather. Patches in what  remained of the leather had been hand-sewn in, and even the patches had  an appearance of decrepit antiquity. &quot;I now give it back to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Back?&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto  strode over to her, an almost unbearable intensity flashing across her  normally stoic eyes. &quot;Guided by a new eon, you are Sailor Neptune.&quot; She  then carefully placed the rotting leather package into Michiru's hands.  &quot;Unwrap it.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru looked up at the taller woman, and noted the  look of anticipation evident in her crimson eyes. Looking back down at  the bundle in her hands, she began to peel the leather away, the  timeworn and tattered material ripping and crumbling to dust under her  fingertips to reveal a strange looking wand. It was light blue in  color, and was topped with a shiny green crystal carved in a crescent  shape, with a ring surrounding the crescent at an angle. A six-pointed  star of gold jutted out of the top of the crystalline sculpture, with  what looked like a stylized trident engraved into it (even though she'd  never seen the symbol before, she somehow recognized it as the  planetary symbol of Neptune). The other side of the wand ended in a  golden orb, and as she held it she noted that the rod part fit  perfectly in the palm of her hand, almost as if it had been tailored to  her.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold the henshin wand up,&quot; Pluto explained, &quot;And say 'Neptune planet power, make up!'&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  was about to protest again, but stopped. Pluto had an air of authority  about her, and it wasn't as if the young freshman had much of a choice  in the matter. After all, what was she going to do? Run? Run to where?  And while swimming had made her more physically fit, the woman standing  before her was taller than she was and had a large ornate staff that  could easily double as a weapon. She also hesitated because, strange at  it might seem, she was experiencing a sense of deja vu as she held the  wand.</p>
<p>She held the wand up above her head. &quot;Neptune planet power, make up!&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  wasn't quite sure what happened next. If she had to, she might've  describe the euphoric sensation as something of a cross between a  religious ecstasy and an orgasm. The seas swirled and blew around her  like a hurricane with her in the eye of the storm as her clothing  disappeared, an ocean wind blowing up and around her. She closed her  eyes and held out her hands as a fuku similar to that of Sailor Pluto  and Sailor V formed itself around her, and she could feel the threads  weaving themselves into place around her body as a tiara appeared on  her forehead.</p>
<p>Opening her eyes again, she felt different.</p>
<p>She felt <em>powerful</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Destiny  has chosen you, Michiru,&quot; Pluto said. &quot;There is a great evil at work in  the world, and it has recently struck within your school. Aya's death  was no heart attack. She was attacked by a daemon, and her pure heart  crystal was stolen from her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see...&quot; Neptune began, &quot;Then the three of us are to stop the daemon, correct?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Three?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You did say Sailor V was one of us, correct?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is, but she will not be helping you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, I don't understand. You just confirmed that Sailor V is a fellow Sailor Senshi. Why wouldn't she be able to help us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She  can't. She musn't even know of our existence, not yet anyways. She has  her own mission, one that only she can perform and which, even now, has  called her to travel half a world away to England. You likewise have a  mission...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Neptune interrupted, &quot;Catch the daemon that killed Aya, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto's face was unwavering as she shook her head. &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>No</strong>?&quot; Neptune asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&quot;This  is bigger than Aya,&quot; Pluto began, &quot;Bigger than your school, bigger than  Japan even. I'm not all seeing, unfortunately, but from what I can see  through my Time Gate the enemy appears to be hunting for the talismans  necessary to create the Holy Grail. The Grail can either be used for  great good or to unleash an unspeakable evil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unspeakable evil?&quot; Neptune asked. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neptune, do you not remember the dream of the great Silence?&quot;</p>
<p>Neptune's eyes widened. &quot;Then... that was real too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not  if we can stop it. Your mission is to find the talismans first. The  daemon struck your classmate because it thought the girl might have one  of them within her. Sooner or later, one of the talismans will be  found, and when that happens you must be there to snatch it first, to  keep it out of the hands of our enemies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But... You say that  one of these things stole Aya's pure heart crystal, and that's the true  reason she died. If one of them finds one of the talismans and I take  it away, the victim will still die, won't they? Only then I'd be the  cause of their death, not the daemon. Correct?&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto looked away  from Neptune's gaze and sighed sadly. &quot;This is a war, Michiru. A  crusade, if I might borrow terminology a girl such as yourself with a  Catholic background might better understand. Yes, innocent people will  have to die, just as one already has, before this crusade is over. For  what it's worth, we don't need the heart crystals of those who do not  possess one of the three talismans. Those you may return to their  rightful owners after you dispose of the daemon who stole them. Such is  the path of a warrior that destiny has chosen for you. I wish I could  tell you more, but for the moment I must not.&quot;</p>
<p>Neptune listened  to everything Pluto had to say, and thought about all she'd just  learned. Slowly, she began to frown as she narrowed her eyes at Pluto.  &quot;Then, if everything you've said so far is true, that means in essence  that we are more or less equals, correct?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To a point, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Then here's my conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto's eyes widened ever so slightly. &quot;Conditions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  won't be lied to or manipulated, nor will I allow myself to be  patronized. If, as you say, there are reasons why you cannot divulge  certain things to me at this time, fine, but do not think me a fool.  This is no grand crusade, and I am no hero. The role you have cast for  me is that of a vulture, a scavenger who must wait until innocent  people are attacked to see if they are carriers of the talismans.  'Destiny' has given me the exact same mission as the enemy, only our  ends differ. The carriers of the talismans will still have to die.&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto  did not become angry by the outburst, nor did she seem apologetic  either. If anything, she looked at Neptune with a bit of pity. &quot;You see  things very black and white, don't you?&quot; she asked rhetorically.  &quot;Michiru, if you were able to travel back in time, to Austria in the  year 1894, and ran into a five year old Adolph Hitler, would you be  able to kill him? Or would you not, knowing that by not doing so you'd  be sentencing six million Jews to death, to say nothing of the other  victims of the holocaust and World War Two?&quot;</p>
<p>Neptune was taken aback. &quot;What kind of a question is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've  seen the dream, and the vision you saw is the same as the one I saw.  All life on Earth, every man, woman, child, plant and animal down to  the smallest of insects will be destroyed in the event known as the  Silence. To prevent the Silence, we must have the talismans before the  Death Busters do. This is a war, Michiru. It is a war for all of life  on Earth, and if it should cost two or three lives to save six billion,  then it must be.&quot;</p>
<p>Neptune was silent.</p>
<p>&quot;When you come upon a  daemon and wish to attack, say 'Deep Submerge!' and aim the attack at  the enemy. Afterwards, close your eyes and will yourself to transform  back into Michiru Kaioh. And now,&quot; she said as the mist surrounding  them became thicker, &quot;You must go back. Trust in your growing psychic  powers. They will alert you to when Sailor Neptune is needed, and will  help you to survive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, wait!&quot; Neptune yelled out as the mist  began to slowly clear, &quot;I...&quot; her voice died off as she found herself  once more in her dorm's bathroom at St. Agatha's. She closed her eyes  as Pluto had instructed, and willed herself to transform back. This  time she could feel the fuku dissolving around her even as power  drained from the young girl, leaving her momentarily light headed. Once  again she could feel cloth weaving itself around her, only now it was  her nightgown reforming itself.</p>
<p>She left the bathroom a short  time later and checked the time. It was four thirty in the morning. She  wasn't scheduled to be up for another two and a half hours, but she  knew she wasn't going to be getting any more sleep tonight. She turned  the lamp on next to her bed and sat on the edge of her bed, still  feeling frazzled and shell shocked from all she'd just learned. As she  looked over to see her roommate still fast asleep, something suddenly  occured to her.</p>
<p>&quot;I should have asked about the blonde in my dream,&quot; she whispered to herself.</p>
<p>When  morning came, Takayo was surprised to find Michiru already up and  showered. After she had showered herself, both girls got dressed.  Takayo noted with some concern that Michiru was quieter than usual that  morning, as if something was heavily weighing on her mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan,&quot; she asked, &quot;Is everything okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everything's fine,&quot; Michiru responded as she covertly slipped her henshin wand into her violin case. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Just then there was a knock at their door. Takayo answered it, and smiled pleasantly. &quot;Konichiwa, Miyuki-san.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Onee-sama?&quot;  Michiru asked, grabbing her books and violin case as she rushed to the  door. Quickly bowing, she blushed involuntarily beneath the older  girl's gaze. Miyuki had her hair pulled back into a pair of French  braids, the bangs in front cut just above her eyebrows. The older  girl's dark eyes seemed to mesmerize Michiru, holding her captive as  she watched the light glitter and dance across their surfaces.</p>
<p>&quot;Konichiwa, Michiru-chan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Onee-sama, I... What are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>Miyuki  chuckled a bit. &quot;I was on my way to first period classes, and thought  I'd stop by and see if you'd like to go with me as far as your own  classroom. Of course, if you had other plans...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru?&quot; Takayo quipped, &quot;Are you kidding?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru flashed her roommate an icy stare.</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Then let's get going, ne?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Oh, hai,&quot; Michiru answered, consciously pushing last night's events out of her mind as she followed the older girl.</p>
<p>Elsewhere,  Pluto was contemplating their conversation. It was funny how the old,  familiar personality traits were still there just under the surface. As  soon as the wonder and fear of the situation had subsided, Neptune's  strong-willed personality flashed through the girl. Michiru had  demanded not to be lied or manipulated with, and Pluto had given her  word not to.</p>
<p>Ignoring the pangs of guilt threatening to rear  their ugly heads, Pluto reasoned that she'd had to lie to Michiru, that  it was for her own good and the situation demanded it. She needed  Neptune, not just to hold back the tide of what was to come but to find  Uranus. Just as fate had decreed that the love between Prince Endymion  and Princess Serenity would unite them again in this day and age, so  the unbreakable bond between Uranus and Neptune would soon begin to  call out to Michiru. When that day came, surely she would forgive Pluto  her machinations, wouldn't she?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the St. Agatha's school library, something began to stir...</p>
