<p>Mamoru stepped outside the airport to be greeted by the cold air  that filled his lungs. He looked around and saw that Usagi was waiting  for him, jumping up and down to catch his attention. He waved and ran  towards her.</p>
<p>“Mamoru! Mamoru!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Usagi! It’s  so good to see you!” he replied as he held her in his arms. Suddenly,  he withdrew from the embrace and kissed her forehead. “I missed you so  much.” They both walked towards the parking lot and loaded his luggage  into the car. As Usagi was driving towards his apartment, Mamoru  couldn’t help but keep his eyes on her. <em>She seems to have lost a lot of weight since I last saw her. </em>He felt worried.</p>
<p>“Something wrong Mamo-chan?” asked Usagi when she felt his eyes on her.</p>
<p>“Oh it’s nothing. You just look different that’s all.”</p>
<p>Usagi  gulped. She hoped that he hadn’t noticed the weight loss. “It’s  nothing, just a little stressed and I recently recovered from a slight  cold.” It was partly true. She did just recently recover from a cold  two days ago. Apparently the outing with the girls along with the cold  air made her weak. She woke up the following morning with a high fever  and had finally recovered in time for Mamoru’s arrival.</p>
<p>“You’re okay now, right? Maybe you still feel a little weak...”</p>
<p>“Hai. I feel better now. Especially now that you’re here!”</p>
<p>When  they arrived at his apartment, Usagi settled on the couch nearby the  fireplace. It was beginning to get darker outside, which meant that the  temperature probably got colder. Mamoru finally settled next to Usagi  after grabbing a blanket to put on her. She looked at him, “Arigato  Mamo-chan.”</p>
<p>“Hai. You were shivering. So what’s the late news? I feel like I haven’t spoken to you in ages.”</p>
<p>“Nothing much as happened. The girls and I went shopping a few days before you got back.”</p>
<p>Mamoru  nodded, but he recently received a phone call from Rei explaining the  surprise party she and Minako had in store for everyone. Mamoru was  asked to bring Usagi to Crown Karaoke as soon as they gave him a call.</p>
<hr />
Rei  struggled with hanging the streamers on the wall. She was on one of the  ladders that Motoki had lent them and it was a little wobbly whenever  she would lean too far.
<p>“Minako, could you pass me the tape?”</p>
<p>The  idol grabbed it and reached over to give it to Rei. She then turned  around, without noticing that part of the streamers had stuck to the  bottom of her shoe. As she walked farther away, the streamer began to  pull against the ladder. Minako started to decorate the table with its  centerpiece and the food, when suddenly she heard Rei yelp. Minako  turned around and found Rei trying to grab hold of something. Before  she could take a step forward, the ladder fell and Rei screamed. She  landed on the couch and the streamers followed along with her.</p>
<p>“Ow  ow ow ow!” she exclaimed as she tried to get up. All Rei could see was  the pile of streamers that tangled around her and from Minako’s point  of view, Rei looked like a big ball of yarn struggling to get up.</p>
<p>Minako ran towards the miko, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Other than a sore butt, I’ll be fine.” Minako couldn’t help but laugh and Rei glared at her and threw a pillow, “Not funny!”</p>
<p>“Is funny!” replied Minako as she threw the pillow back “Come on. Let’s get these things off you before you get strangled.”</p>
<p>As the idol began to brush one of the streamers from Rei’s face, Motoki came running in.</p>
<p>“Everything okay? I heard someone yell.”</p>
<p>“We’re  fine Motoki, just keep a look out for us.” Motoki nodded. He had gotten  the news about Rei and Minako’s plans and offered to help them out.</p>
<p>“How much longer? All this excitement is putting me on my toes.”</p>
<p>“Just a little longer.”</p>
<hr />
Meanwhile, Makoto was seated in her car with her cell phone pressed against her ear.
<p>“Ami-chan,  you don’t mind coming with me to go shopping for the girls?” asked  Makoto. She couldn’t get a hold of the others and knew that Usagi was  spending time with Mamoru. Makoto had gotten so caught up things that  she was behind in her Christmas shopping.</p>
<p>“Eh? You still didn’t find anything for them?”</p>
<p>“Well, I found something for Usagi and of course you, but Minako and Rei are hard to shop for.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m free the whole day, meet you there?”</p>
<p>“Actually I’m outside your building right now.”</p>
<p>Ami looked outside her window and found Makoto’s car parked nearby the curb.</p>
<p>“Ah. Let me get my coat and I’ll be out in a minute.”</p>
<p>“Ja.”</p>
<p>As  both girls stepped inside the mall, they began to look at stores that  would suit Rei. They found a store and inside were a soft plushy Nako  Nako doll. Ami picked it up as it yelped, “Kupi!” Makoto giggled and  picked up a similar one.</p>
<p>“Do you think Rei-chan would hate me if I gave her this?”</p>
<p>“I think she’d have a fit.”</p>
<p>“But it’s so cute! I’m buying it.”</p>
<p>They  walked into the next store, which was a hat store and they began to  playfully try on the different hats, they spotted one in particular. It  was a simple black and white trucker hat with a few rhinestones that  formed into the shape of the Venus sign. “Oh this is perfect for  Minako!” Makoto exclaimed as she picked it up. After they purchased it,  they began to head towards the exit. Before both girls could leave the  store, they cell phones began to ring.</p>
<p>“Everyone, emergency meeting at Crown Karaoke! Hurry!” The phone call cut off, but Minako’s voice was distinct.</p>
<p>Ami gasped, “Minako!!”</p>
<p>“They  must have gotten cut off, we need to hurry.” Ami nodded and they both  ran outside towards Makoto’s car. She started the ignition and hurried  towards Crown Karaoke.</p>
<p>Mamoru received a similar phone call,  although he knew what was going on and drove Usagi. As soon as they  arrived, they saw that Ami and Makoto were running in. Usagi ran to  join them, but looked back at Mamoru.</p>
<p>“Go on. I’ll be with Motoki.” She nodded and joined her friends as they entered the room.</p>
<p>“SURPRISE!!!” yelled Minako and Rei.</p>
<p>All  three girls looked around in confusion as confetti began to scatter the  room. The whole place was decorated in green and red, and in the middle  of the table, was a small, but incredibly beautiful Christmas tree, and  food. Mamoru and Motoki walked in as Usagi and Makoto eyed them. “Did  you two know about this?” They looked at them guiltily and nodded.</p>
<p>“We’re going to go now,” said Motoki.</p>
<p>“No! Stay since you guys helped,” said Minako.</p>
<p>Mamoru  turned and smiled. “Well, Motoki, the Shitennou, and I actually planned  something as well. You girls have your fun, we’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Usagi looked at him, hugged him, and whispered “Thank you.”</p>
<p>She then turned around to everyone and said, “Arigato! This is the best Christmas present!”</p>
