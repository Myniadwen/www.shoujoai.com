<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 1 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<p>Aphrodite, the Goddess of love and beauty was also the ruler of the planet Venus. Her 
subjects adored her; the entire solar system adored her. She was often showered with praise, 
all of it attributed not only to her undying beauty but also for her seemingly boundless 
wisdom (the occasional offerings weren’t too shabby either). It was well known that the 
royal family resided within the great Cupid Palace, the symbolic core of Venus’s planet. It 
was built from the finest white marble, made to tower over the Capital city, 
Cytherea<b>,</b> from atop of the highest hill, and was supplemented by luxurious grounds 
which were decorated by large statues and exquisite fountains. Living as a Goddess should 
live, being the supreme ruler of her element and of a planet…while also being praised as any 
God or Goddess of her rank rightfully should…</p><p>This ruler was not happy.</p><p>There 
was a heavy, unsettling atmosphere in the throne room that was causing a stir amongst her 
audience. Queen Aphrodite sat with a deepening, furrowed brow as she gazed into the royal 
viewing orb. Past the red haze that clouded the crystal’s surface, the Goddess found herself 
standing amidst a bloodied battlefield and on that battlefield emerged a familiar figure 
adorned in magnificent, red armor. There was the lifeless, dead corpse of a woman in his 
arms; anger sparked deep within the Goddess’s bosom.</p><p>“Ares…” Aphrodite mumbled, 
fighting to quell the rage that she felt. <i>He’s at it again! </i>“One war after another, 
day after day! This is going too far, even if he is the God of War!”</p><p>Her subjects 
shrank at the sound of her powerful voice.</p><p><i>For what you have done...I will never 
forgive you! A</i><i>s the Goddess of love, I must do something about this…but with what and 
how…</i></p><p>The maids and servants in the audience chamber eyed their ruler warily; they 
were unsure of what to do or say that would please their ladyship. However, the truth was 
that many would rather say nothing at all; the conflict between Aphrodite and Ares was a 
fierce, on-going battle that spanned across many centuries or even millennia perhaps. They 
were both leaders of opposing elements and it <i>was</i> a ruler’s rightful duty to promote 
their own sphere of influence, whether it was Love or War.</p><p>“I have it! Bring me Minako 
immediately!” Aphrodite’s voice boomed.</p><p>A summons had been issued.</p><p>In no time at 
all, the large, grand doors of the audience chamber re-opened to reveal the appearance of a 
beautiful, slender girl who looked to be in her late teens. She possessed long, flowing 
strands of golden-blonde hair which fell down just past her waistline, and she possessed the 
most enrapturing cerulean blue eyes that any had laid eyes on. Those blue eyes twinkled with 
excitement of a mysterious kind as her reddish-pink, luscious lips curled up into a smile. 
Although she was not as well known as Aphrodite, the girl still had her share of 
admirers.</p><p>“You summoned me Mother?” She addressed the Goddess as she entered the 
room.</p><p>In the background, a servant announced, “Presenting her royal highness, Princess 
Venus Minako, the youngest of Her Majesty, Queen Aphrodite’s daughters!”</p><p>Minako spared 
a quick glance around the audience chamber, and was surprised by the unusually large 
crowd.</p><p><i>I wonder what’s going on... </i>She was starting to get nervous. <i>Was 
there some kind of scheduled event that I forgot about? Hmm…I know! Just smile and nod, it 
ALWAYS works! Yeah, that’s what I’ll do!</i></p><p>“That is correct,” Aphrodite nodded. She 
was pleased that her daughter had remembered to curtsy this time around after forgetting the 
last ten times consecutively (this formality was not required in their private gatherings 
but it served as a good show for the guests during social events).</p><p>“I have an urgent 
mission for you, one that I am unable to fulfill myself with the duties I need to uphold 
here.”</p><p>“A mission?” Minako repeated.</p><p><i>A mission? Did I hear what I thought I 
just heard?! A MISSION?! OMG. I’ve never actually gone on a mission before! Okay Minako, 
stay cool. You don’t want to blow this chance.</i></p><p>“What is it about, if I may 
inquire?”</p><p>“I was about to explain that.”</p><p><i>Fudge. </i></p><p>“Yes, of course 
Mother.”</p><p>“You are already aware of the circumstances surrounding Ares and myself, 
correct?” Minako gave a slight nod in response. Already she could feel a sinking feeling 
beginning to form in pit her stomach at the mention of the War God. “As of today, I’ve 
decided that I’ve had enough of his antics. I would like to settle things once and for 
all.”</p><p>The silence was instantly broken by a murmur of voices.</p><p>“Did you hear 
that?”</p><p>“I-I think I did…are you sure you heard what we thought we heard?”</p><p>“There 
won’t be a war with Mars will there?”</p><p><i>A war with Mars?</i> Minako also found 
herself questioning her mother’s intentions. <i>But we would be outclassed for sure if it 
came down to a physical fight.</i></p><p>“SILENCE!” Aphrodite commanded, and all obeyed. “I 
assure you, there will be <i>no</i> war with Mars. Instead, I was merely contemplating on 
negotiating with the God of War. Peaceful talk, nothing more...”</p><p>But Minako caught the 
mischievous gleam in her mother’s eye. It was the very same one reflecting in hers as well. 
Suddenly, it all became clear.</p><p>“Ahh…and I assume you would like me to do these 
‘peaceful negotiations’ in your place Mother?”</p><p>“That is correct. Do you think you can 
handle such an important task?”</p><p>Minako answered her mother’s smirk with a hearty 
laugh. Her blonde hair swept to either side of her back while some strands came to lie over 
her shoulders.</p><p>“Yes, of course!” She answered. Her voice was bursting with 
confidence.</p><p><i>After all, there is no man that I cannot seduce! </i>Minako inwardly 
grinned. <i>One look of me and he’ll instantly be putty in my hands. The wars WILL stop. 
Just think about it. The Universe at peace, no more fighting... I never saw a point to the 
whole killing-for-the-sake-of-killing thing anyway.</i></p><p>“I will do 
it!”</p><p>“Excellent! I will expect good news from you, my child. You will depart later 
this afternoon. Do not let me down!”</p><p>“I won’t Mother!”</p><p><u>(Corridor in the Ram 
Palace, Planet of Mars)</u></p><p>“Sir, we’ve just received a report from Venus. It appears 
that a representative from Venus is currently on her way here.”</p><p>Several footsteps, 
accompanied by the loud clanking of metal echoed throughout the marble hallway.</p><p>“What 
a bother…” A commanding voice muttered in annoyance. “Who is it? Surely it cannot be 
Aphrodite herself.”</p><p><i>It must be some unimportant pawn.</i></p><p>“No. We have reason 
to believe that it’s her daughter.”</p><p>The leader’s footsteps momentarily stopped. 
“...Her daughter?”</p><p>“That is correct, Sir.”</p><p><i>How unusual. I wasn’t even aware 
that Venus had an heir.</i></p><p>“I see. Did the messenger state the reason of her 
visit?”</p><p>“No Sir. When inquired, the messenger said that the reason of the visit is to 
be delivered personally by the Queen’s representative herself.”</p><p>“Is that right? So 
they intend to keep it a secret until then...”</p><p>The man flinched as the commander 
brushed past him. When no blows were exchanged, he quietly let out a sigh of relief and then 
fell back into line with the others behind their leader.</p><p><i>Why would Venus’s ruler 
send her only child? Any normal diplomat should be more than adequate to deliver a simple 
message. Unless... is Aphrodite up to something? Ha, like I should worry about some a little 
girl.</i></p><p>“Sir, what shall you have me do?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“SIR?” The man’s heart 
nearly leapt from his chest when his superior suddenly spoke up.</p><p>“Send the girl in the 
moment she arrives. I will meet with her in the throne room.”</p><p>“Uh…Y-Yes! Of course! 
Very good Sir.”</p><p><i>This should prove to be interesting… </i></p><p>Long raven hair 
whipped behind the superior’s back as they marched towards the throne room.</p><p><i>Very 
interesting indeed...</i></p><p><b>Tup, Tup, tup, tup…</b></p><p><u>(A time later, Courtyard 
of the Ram Palace)</u></p><p>Minako had finally arrived at her destination. She now stood 
directly outside the palace, reluctantly admiring its uniqueness.</p><p><i>Wow, Mars is far 
different than I had imagined it to be. </i>She thought to herself in mixed awe and 
disappointment.</p><p>The scenery around her contrasted greatly with her memories of home; 
Mars was dry, dusty and environmentally harsh in its overall appearance. There was red sand 
for miles around without another, single building in sight. And the atmosphere, as soon as 
Minako had stepped off of the shuttle she immediately noticed the massive difference in 
temperature between her home planet and Mars. The intense heat continued to barrel into her, 
and, already, her throat felt parched. Her mother sent her to a bloody desert of all 
places.</p><p><i>Jeez... I really, really, REALLY hope this won’t take too long. I sure 
don’t want to stay here for too long if I can help it. What a time to forget my suntan 
lotion.</i> She sighed and checked the time.</p><p><i>Where </i><i><u>is</u></i><i> that 
servant already?! They sure have crappy service over here.</i></p><p>In an attempt to 
distract herself from the discomfort, she glanced around at what sparse decoration there was 
in the Martian courtyard. To her luck, she found herself surrounded by statues, statues and 
more statues; worst yet, she couldn’t help but notice how they were all carved to resemble a 
sole warrior- it was of a man (she could feel the excitement already oozing out). He 
possessed short, curled hair, and a strong, muscular body that was shielded by a heavy, but 
well crafted suit of armor. In each of the statues he was presented in different poses. Many 
times the statues centralized on heroic idolization of the man. One statue showed the man 
brandishing his sword at an unseen enemy, while another depicted him striking a confident 
pose while he is surrounded by loyal subjects- and, Minako’s personal favourite, there was 
one where he had rammed a sword through a poor peasant boy’s chest.</p><p>She needed to do a 
double take when an attendant emerged from the palace’s front entrance (although the man was 
wearing a helmet, she had a funny feeling that he resembled the skewered peasant boy a 
little too much).</p><p>“Lady Venus?” The soldier addressed 
her.</p><p><i>Finally!</i></p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“I don’t mean to be impolite or a bother, but 
our leader is waiting for you patiently in the throne room. I’ve been ordered to bring you 
there first before all else… Please don’t hate me!” He blurted out and quickly begged 
forgiveness.</p><p><i>That’s the funny thing with people… it’s like no one has ever spoken 
to a Goddess before.</i></p><p>Minako sighed. “It’s no problem at all. Actually, I was 
hoping to speak with Mar’s leader as soon as possible. This is 
perfect.”</p><p>“R-Really?”</p><p>“Yes. Really. Now, if you would please show the 
way?”</p><p>“Ah, yes! Please follow me!”</p><p>Minako followed the soldier into the palace 
and walked behind him as he steered them down a series of long corridors made from a mix of 
red and white marble. She couldn’t help but inwardly groan at the sight of more statues of 
guess who?</p><p>She stopped the man in front of relatively harmless statue where the figure 
held a sword and shield in a prideful stance.</p><p>“Hey, if you don’t mind asking... I’ve 
been noticing that you guys have an awful lot of statues of this man. Who is he?” She 
asked.</p><p>The question seemed to greatly surprise her tour guide. “Y-You mean you don’t 
know who that is? That’s astounding! And you’re here as a representative? I-I mean, not that 
I mean you should have known or you would have known but… it’s no big deal!” He quickly 
corrected himself when he caught a glance from the blonde beauty. He then cleared his throat 
with a small cough, trying to keep his thoughts away from anything ‘distracting’. “The 
statue that you see before you is modeled after Ares, the God of War. He’s our leader and a 
great one at that! I can’t even begin to tell you what an amazing strategist he is; the 
casualties on our side are always kept to a minimum. And his fighting spirit, it is truly a 
sight to behold! In brilliantly, flashing red armor our leader charges into battle at the 
FRONT lines, bringing down his wraith on any poor fool that would dare stand up against him. 
Watching him is an inspiration to our troops!”</p><p><i>Great, an obsessed fan boy... 
</i>Minako rolled her eyes. <i>So that’s Ares, my target. Huh, he sure doesn’t look like 
much. If the rumours about him are true, then his lust for pleasure should be as great as 
his lust for war. </i></p><p>“Sounds like quite the guy. I can’t wait to meet 
him.”</p><p>“You will soon enough.” The attendant nodded approvingly, yet his face seemed a 
tad bit flush as he spoke to the woman in front of him. “L-Let’s continue shall we? The 
throne room isn’t far from here.”</p><p>Another several right turns, and a few wrong turns 
(Minako was convinced her guide was beginning to have some trouble concentrating), the pair 
had finally reached their destination. Before them was a large set of doors. They were very 
similar to the ones in Cupid Palace, but they instead bore Mar’s unique insignia instead of 
Venus’s within the metal frame. Long, thin lines of gold also danced intricate patterns 
around the core.</p><p>“This is as far as I can go. But in here is where you will meet our 
leader. She might be a bit scary at first but don’t let her intimidate you. It’s the best 
advice I can give you.”</p><p>“W-Wait a second, did you just say ‘she’?” <i>I thought Ares 
was male!</i></p><p>“Well, I’ll leave you to your business Lady Venus. Please excuse me 
while I go put your luggage away. I do hope you that will enjoy your stay,” The man rambled, 
completely ignoring the previous question before running off.</p><p>“H-Hey! Ah…fudge, he’s 
gone! But… what was that about?” Minako crossed her arms in worried thought. “I’m pretty 
sure I heard him say ‘she’ but, oh, that can’t be right!” <i>Right? </i>“Gah, what-ever! All 
this thinking is making my head hurt... I guess I’ll just have to see for myself. But I know 
I must’ve heard wrong, that’s all.”</p><p>With little effort Minako pressed on the large, 
grand doors and opened them, allowing herself entry into Mar’s throne room. Inside there was 
a solid red strip of marble leading from the doorway up to the throne seat. The lustre of 
the marble material had caught Minako’s gaze for a moment; she was surprised at how 
reflective its surface was. It was definitely much more pleasing to the eye that some of the 
structures outside. There weren’t large statues in the room either, something she was 
internally grateful for; there were only so many statues of Ares that she could take. But 
with that thought, it made her wonder what it would be like to see the actual model in 
person.</p><p>Her eyes trailed up to the throne’s seat and immediately they connected with a 
pair of cold amethyst. Minako let out a small gasp.</p><p><i>What’s a woman doing here? And 
on the throne no less! Wouldn’t she get in trouble? Where’s Ares?!</i></p><p>As Minako 
approached the throne she couldn’t shake the uneasiness she felt from the amethyst eyes that 
observed her every move. She also couldn’t help but, in turn, unconsciously evaluate the 
figure before her; silky, long raven hair, a perfectly shaped face and a nearly perfect 
complexion. Her imagination took one step further and predicted a muscular and well shaped 
body underneath all of that armor as well. Minako was captivated. Out of all the things she 
found on Mars, this being sparked more curiosity in her than any of Ares’ statues. For one, 
the woman was before her in flesh and blood and she couldn’t very well ignore the fiery 
quality in her eyes. She possessed a strong, dominating spirit. Minako was certain of it. 
But where had she felt something like this before?</p><p><i>She surely couldn’t be an 
ordinary soldier. Her aura… it feels too strong for that. </i>Minako’s observations were 
briefly postponed as she came to a halt.</p><p>In the most formal tone she could muster she 
then stated, “I am a Princess of Venus, Venus Minako. I came here to request an audience 
with Ares, the God of War.”</p><p>“Ares?” The raven-haired woman looked slightly amused. 
“Well, as you can see... he’s not here at the moment.”</p><p>“Oh. Well, yes, I can see that. 
So then, where is he? Or do you know when he will be back?”</p><p>“I cannot reveal his 
location nor do I know when he will be back.”</p><p>“Wow, that’s helpful…” Minako whispered 
in frustration under her breath.</p><p>If the other woman had heard her, she chose to ignore 
the comment. “My name is Mars Rei. For the time being, I am the acting leader. So if you 
have some business with Mars, I’m sure I am more than adequate. Please state your business 
now, Princess of Venus.”</p><p><i>What kind of attitude is that? </i>Minako inwardly 
grumbled. <i>She making it sound like I’m the kid and she’s the grown up! Yeah… right! We 
look like we’re the same age! </i></p><p>“So basically...what you’re saying is that anything 
you say goes, Rei?” The blonde asked for clarification.</p><p>Minako’s use of her name 
seemed to actually had Rei taken aback.</p><p>“Ahem, that would be Sir to you. Now, if you 
would please state your business.” The woman quickly said more forcefully.</p><p><i>Is this 
girl brain-dead or something? I can’t believe I had to ask twice! How incompetent; any 
soldier would have answered without asking any questions at all. Or maybe she didn’t 
understand a word I said? Maybe if I said each word slowly…</i></p><p>Minako ignored the 
cold stare she was getting from the substitute Martian leader. She was too busy wrapped up 
in her own thoughts.</p><p><i>So let’s see…if this woman says something goes then that’s as 
good as getting Ares to agree on something? I cooooould wait until Ares gets back but then 
again I just want to go home from this icky place and since I DON’T KNOW when Ares will get 
back!</i></p><p>“Then I guess I have no choice,” Minako sighed aloud.</p><p>“No choice about 
<i>what</i>?” Rei narrowed her eyes suspiciously.</p><p>“I uhh…I came here to inspect your 
planet. You know, spend time with you, learn what sort of things you do, that sort of thing. 
To uhh… improve the relationships between our planets! 
Aha…hahahahaha….ha…”</p><p><i>Yeeeeeah right. </i>They both simultaneously 
thought.</p><p>“Is that so?” Rei finally replied with a raised eyebrow. “Well then, I 
suppose you can stay.”</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>“Yes. But if you insist on observing our daily 
activities then you will be forced to participate in a few as well. Also you must stay close 
to the guard duty that I assign to you. Do you agree with these terms-”</p><p>“Wait! Hold up 
a sec! Can’t I just stay with you?”</p><p>“E-Excuse me?” Rei stuttered. She had barely 
blinked an eye when the blonde had already swooped up beside her and was leaning 
suggestively into her side.</p><p>“I mean, I <i>am</i> a Princess of Venus. And I assume 
you’re the strongest warrior on this planet since you <i>were</i> chosen to be the 
substitute leader. Wouldn’t I be safer with <i>you</i> guarding me?”</p><p>And when Rei 
thought about it, as infuriating as it was, it was a perfectly, logical statement. “I 
suppose…” Yet she couldn’t shake the foreboding feeling that this woman was up to 
something.</p><p>“Great! So you can call me Mina and show me to my room!”</p><p>“Mina?” Rei 
repeated as the energetic girl began to drag her away out of the throne room. What was going 
on here? This wasn’t supposed to be happening!</p><p>“Yup! And I’ll call you Rei. Sound 
good?” Minako then interlocked her elbow with one of Rei’s despite the armor that separated 
their flesh.</p><p>Rei silently groaned. <i>What am I getting myself into? </i>She concluded 
it was partially due to shock that she was putting up with all of this. From one minute she 
was staring down a formal representative and the next, the official was acting like a 
child.</p><p>“Whatever. Let’s just show you to your room, all right?”</p><p>“Aww… don’t be 
like that.”</p><p>“Hmph.”</p><p><i>Okay, so</i> <i>no big deal...all that changes is that my 
target is a girl. Easy as cake, </i>Minako tried assuring herself. <i>In fact, it might even 
be easier! No one is going to question two girls hanging out all the time. Besides, I think 
I just know how to do this.</i></p><p>A grin then lit her face.</p>
