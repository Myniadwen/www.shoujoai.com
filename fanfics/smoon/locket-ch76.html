<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 76 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/locket-ch75.html">Back to Part 75</a><pre>Arisugawa Juri took a deep breath, the orange haired woman honestly 
looking more than a little frightened. &quot;She&#39;s here, right?&quot; she 
asked softly, her black suit clinging to her form, &quot;Something didn&#39;t 
call her away?&quot;

&quot;Calm down,&quot; the similarly tuxedo clad Haruka Tenoh said, her sandy 
blonde hair falling into her eyes, &quot;she&#39;ll be out here soon.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right, Arisugawa-san?&quot; the Goddess Belldandy asked 
gently, standing there beside them in front of the bar of 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. Her long brown hair flowed down her back in a 
shimmering wave and her robes gave her a formal air that went well 
with the ceremony they were about to do.

&quot;Just nerves, ma&#39;am,&quot; Juri admitted.

&quot;It&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Belldandy reassured her, somehow carrying pure 
confidence just in her tone of voice.

&quot;How come Haruka gets to be best man?&quot; Keiko softly asked from one 
of the front seats in the rows of chairs that had been set up for 
guests. Her brown hair was in it&#39;s usual braid, but this time she 
wore a dress in a soft blue.

&quot;Keiko,&quot; May quietly scolded, the brown haired cyberdoll hitting her 
lover in the shoulder gently. &quot;She&#39;s known Haruka for years.&quot;

&quot;Not for my sake,&quot; Keiko whispered back, &quot;but Utena&#39;s.&quot;

May smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;m not sure Utena would be all that 
comfortable with the job, honestly. You yourself told me that Juri 
hit on Utena that time.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Keiko conceded.

&quot;Do you think Shiori will cause trouble?&quot; Hyatt asked from May&#39;s 
other side.

&quot;Juri invited her?!&quot; Keiko paled.

&quot;Shhh!&quot; both May, Hyatt and Excel shushed her. &quot;I heard she got a 
invitation,&quot; Excel nodded, &quot;you know she and Juri have been keeping 
in touch, sorta.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; Keiko shook her head with a sigh.

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;d cause trouble,&quot; Sasami offered from where the 
little princess sat beside Minagi, &quot;I&#39;m sure she just wants Juri to 
be happy.&quot;

&quot;Occasionally, love,&quot; Minagi murmured, &quot;I think you&#39;re too kind.&quot;

Nabiki Tendo nodded, &quot;I&#39;m glad Utena and the others are sitting with 
Shiori. That ought to stop anything from happening.&quot;

Ayeka and Ryouko sat a few chairs over, along with several residents 
of the Misaki shrine. &quot;So,&quot; Ayeka murmured as she adjusted her 
formal Jurai robes looked up at Ryouko, &quot;when are you planning to 
make a honest woman out of me, pirate?&quot;

&quot;Whenever you want, wench,&quot; Ryouko teased, wearing a more formal 
version of her battle suit, a cape and armor added to the one piece.

&quot;A wedding?&quot; Mihoshi squealed, eyes widening happily.

&quot;Not now, damn it,&quot; Kiyone whacked her girlfriend and partner over 
the head.

&quot;Kiyone, you&#39;re so mean,&quot; Mihoshi&#39;s eyes grew large with tears.

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Kiyone leaned forward to kiss her gently, &quot;don&#39;t cry, love.&quot;

&quot;I was pleasantly surprised to be invited,&quot; Yosho admitted, still 
disguised in his old, grandfatherly form.

&quot;Me too,&quot; Tenchi Masaki admitted, his black hair flowing down his 
back in a ponytail. He smiled slightly, &quot;Juri may have relaxed her 
no males rule, but there&#39;s just us, Mamoru, Touga, Miki, Saionji, 
Saotome-san and Tendo-san.&quot;

&quot;One other,&quot; Tenchi&#39;s grandfather added calmly.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Tenchi blinked.

&quot;Brown haired woman, third row, middle seat. That&#39;s a woman,&quot; 
Grandfather pointed out to him calmly.

Tenchi tried not to look astonished as he took in the elegant beauty 
sitting in another row. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it,&quot; he shook his head.

&quot;You&#39;re being watched,&quot; Yoriko said with some amusement as the 
smaller woman pushed up her glasses, &quot;slightly stunned guy two rows 
back.&quot;

Aoi shook her head as the taller woman sighed, &quot;I assume that 
someone told the poor soul about me.&quot;

Yoriko leaned her head on Aoi&#39;s shoulder, &quot;From what you told me I 
expected Juri to be the last person to get married.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s grown up a lot since I first met her,&quot; Aoi conceded. She 
smiled, &quot;But from what I&#39;ve seen, Setsuna will make her happy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad I threw the Tarot before we came,&quot; Hitomi murmured, the 
brown haired girl sitting beside her lover.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Milerna asked, the taller woman smiling down at her.

&quot;Things are changing,&quot; Hitomi smiled, &quot;but they&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

Standing over in the curtained off library Setsuna Meiou took a 
nervous breath even as she made the final adjustments the white gown 
she wore. &quot;I have never been this terrified in my life,&quot; she smiled 
weakly.

Michiru smiled reassuringly, &quot;You look gorgeous, SEtsuna. I&#39;m sure 
that Juri won&#39;t know what hit her.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Hotaru agreed, the black haired teen smiling up at her 
adopted mother.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Setsuna took a steadying breath.

Minako grinned from where the blonde was sitting in one of the 
library chairs, &quot;And Juri looks hot in that suit.&quot;

&quot;Minako,&quot; Usagi chided as she carried the veil over to Setsuna, her 
golden hair falling down in twin streams.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;d do her,&quot; Minako winked.

&quot;I swear,&quot; Michiru laughed, &quot;Natsuna should keep you on a leash.&quot;

&quot;Who says she doesn&#39;t?&quot; Minako asked impishly.

&quot;Oooh,&quot; Usagi visibly shuddered as she carefully put the veil on 
Setsuna&#39;s head, &quot;mental image I did NOT need, thank you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I ever expected this to happen,&quot; Touga Kiryuu wryly 
admitted from where they sat in the crowd, his white suit gleaming, 
red hair flowing down his back.

&quot;Big brother,&quot; Nanami scolded, the smaller blonde giving him a 
disapproving look.

&quot;He does have a point,&quot; Miki Kaoru reached out to squeeze her hand 
gently.

Saionji smiled, his dark green hair tied back, a wooden boken over 
his shoulders. &quot;I think it was almost worth breaking my training 
regimen for this,&quot; he noted.

&quot;Thank you all for letting me sit with you,&quot; Shiori said quietly, 
the purple haired woman looking lovely in a stylish dress.

&quot;It was no trouble,&quot; Utena Tenjou answerd, her pink hair shining on 
the simple pant suit she wore.

&quot;Besides,&quot; her lover Anthy added wryly, &quot;we wanted to keep an eye on 
you, too.&quot;

Shiori chuckled, &quot;Thank you for the honesty.&quot;

Priss Asagiri saw Belldandy nod, and knew it was time. &quot;Okay Nene,&quot; 
she ordered her friend on the keyboards.

&quot;Right,&quot; Nene Romanova nodded, her blonde hair neat and AD Police 
uniform crisp. Her hands flew across the keyboard as Linna Yamazaki 
set the beat on the drums.

&quot;This rose is our destiny,&quot; Priss sang as Sylia backed her up on 
guitar, &quot;michibikare.Futari wa ima, mou ichido deau.&quot;

Juri felt her heart skip a beat as Setsuna emerged from the library, 
a shimmering vision in white that nearly took her breath away. 
Following the path that had been set up through the many guest she, 
Hotaru and Chibi-Usa walked up to the bar, the girls spreading roses 
as they went and cameras flashing as guest caught the moment on film.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Setsuna asked softly as she reached Juri&#39;s side.

&quot;I am now,&quot; Juri smiled at her warmly.

&quot;Beloved friends and family,&quot; Belldandy said, &quot;we are gathered here 
today to celebrate the joining of two hearts.&quot; A sunny 
smile, &quot;Despite different backgrounds and circumstances these women 
discovered one another, and in each they found the mirror of their 
soul.&quot;

&quot;Aww,&quot; Ami Mizuno sniffled softly as she dabbed at her eyes, Rei 
Hino sitting beside her with an arm over her shoulders.

&quot;Juri Arisugawa,&quot; Belldandy looked over at her, &quot;like many here you 
are a person of destiny. Do you choose to wed your fate and life to 
Setsuna Meiou?&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; Juri asked, not letting her surprise show. &#39;Person of 
destiny?&quot; she thought wildly.

Turning to Setsuna Belldandy said, &quot;Setsuna, guardian of time and 
defender of the ages, do you wish to join your fate and life to 
Juri?&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; Setsuna declared.

&quot;Then by my power and the higher authority I represent,&quot; Belldandy 
smiled, &quot;you may kiss the brides.&quot;

Juri stepped close and flipped up Setsuna&#39;s veil, meeting those 
loving eyes. Bending close she kissed her gently at first, then as 
Setsuna firmly pulled her close kissed her again much, much more 
thoroughly.

&quot;Should we really be here?&quot; Ran Mizuno asked, the tall, blue haired 
young woman watching as Setsuna tossed the flowers then she and Juri 
being swamped by well wishers.

Erica Tenoh smiled, her sandy blonde hair giving her a even greater 
resemblance to her &#39;father&#39; Haruka. &quot;I couldn&#39;t resist,&quot; she 
said, &quot;even if Setsuna&#39;s going to be annoyed we went joyriding with 
a time-key.&quot;
