EPILOUGE

Trumpets blasted and drums sounded across the Great Hall. Everyone knelt 
as Neo Queen Serenity glided into the room from the back of stage. The 
senshi all stood in full dress, standing side by side on either side of 
the Queen&#39;s entrance. Endymion stood near the front of the stage, bowing 
slightly as Serenity approached. Serenity nodded to all of her senshi as 
she passed. Mercury and Jupiter standing next to one another, wearing 
matching gold bands. Mars and Venus standing next to them, silver 
engagement bands glittering in the sun. She smiled at Endymion briefly 
before approaching the lone figure who was on one knee at the front and 
center of the stage, the sole reason for this ceremony. The girl raised 
her head as Serenity approached and the Queen smiled down at Kira.

&quot;Kira-san, &quot; She began, &quot; You and I did not first meet on the best of 
terms. The senshi and your kind were in constant battle, opposite sides 
from the start. But you turned your back to their evil, choose to fight 
for good, to fight for us. Since that day you have proven yourself loyal 
to the Crown, an invaluable member of this team.&quot; Kira cocked her head 
curiously and Serenity almost laughed. It had been hard to keep all of 
this a secret from Kira, but seeing her face when she found out what 
this was all for would be worth it. Serenity raised her arms and called 
forth her septor, the Millennium Crystal nestled in it&#39;s edge. She stood 
directly before Kira, and lowered it to tap Kira&#39;s left shoulder.

&quot;Kira-san, as Queen of the Millennium Kingdom, holder of the Millennium 
Crystal,&quot; She touched Kira&#39;s right shoulder with the glowing crystal and 
smiled. &quot;I hear-by name you a guardian to the Kingdom. An honorary 
Sailor Senshi.&quot; Kira&#39;s jaw dropped and her eyes went wide but Serenity 
only grinned. &quot;Stand Kira.&quot; She commanded and Kira did, looking at 
Serenity in shock and wonder. To have been accepted by them was one 
thing, but this? &quot;Do you accept this position and all of the 
responsibilities it entails?&quot; Serenity asked carefully and Kira&#39;s eyes 
darted behind the Queen briefly, seeking out the security of Pluto. The 
guardian of time gave her a proud grin and Kira straightened her back 
and faced the Queen. She inclined her head slightly and forced her voice 
to sound calm.

&quot;I would be honored, your majesty.&quot; She said and the Queen nodded to 
her. The senshi all broke out into cheers and, unable to help herself, 
Kira gave the Queen a big hug. When she pulled back Serenity just 
squeezed her shoulders lightly and steeped back as the others came to 
congratulate her. Kira shook hands and gave hugs and took 
congratulations for a while, still in shock. Me, a sailor senshi. 
Finally, the senshi she wanted to greet the most approached her and she 
held Pluto tightly. &quot;Now I&#39;m like you Pluto. Now we&#39;re both senshi.&quot; She 
whispered happily and grinned broadly into her lover&#39;s shoulder, tears 
welling in her eyes. Pluto beamed with happiness, proud of Kira and 
pleased that she had earned this right. She kissed her love gently and 
did her best to ignore the whistling from Uranus.

After a bit and a final congrats, Neo Queen Serenity left with Endymion 
and the senshi all transformed back. Kira was snuggling happily with 
Setsuna when Ami and Makoto walked up again.

&quot;Hey, congrats again Kira-san.&quot; Makoto said happily and Kira grinned.

&quot;Thank you. Now I just have to decide on whether or not to get a fuku 
myself. What do you think I should do Suna-chan?&quot; They all laughed as 
Setsuna fought a small blush.

&quot;I&#39;m sure Setsuna-san will be happy no matter what you do. Though I 
think she&#39;d prefer the skirt.&quot; Makoto said with a grin and Setsuna 
blushed again though the idea of her girlfriend in said short skirt was 
a happy thought indeed. Kira gave them both hugs and they walked out 
hand in hand. Watching them leave Kira gave a small chuckle.

&quot;You know, I&#39;m glad Makoto-chan finally got over my and Ami-chan&#39;s 
little thing so long ago.&quot; Setsuna laughed a little remembering just how 
long Makoto had been annoyed with Kira after discovering just what her 
girlfriend&#39;s vacation had consisted of. Rei and Minako headed their way 
and Setsuna hid her laughter.

&quot;Hey you two.&quot; Kira greeted happily and hugs were exchanged all around.

&quot;Aw no uniform? And here I thought you&#39;d look good in red and orange.&quot; 
Rei quirked and Minako nodded adamantly.

&quot;Yeah. Orange and red go very well together.&quot; Kira laughed realizing 
that their colors would probably be her own.

&quot;Oh hey. &quot; She mentioned, a thought popping to mind. &quot;Speaking of 
colors, did you ever decide on a color scheme to use at the wedding?&quot; 
Minako sighed heavily and Rei shook her head.

&quot;We still haven&#39;t been able to decide. The decorators are going crazy 
with the date only a month away too.&quot; Minako took Rei&#39;s hand and 
grinned.

&quot;We actually have to get going. We have an appointment with them this 
afternoon.&quot; Kira waved to them as they walked out, bits of a 
conversation that consisted of &#39;pastels!&#39; and &#39;neons!&#39; hitting both Kira 
and Setsuna as the girls disappeared from view. Seeing the amused look 
on Kira face Setsuna giggled and nudged her shoulder.

&quot;At least Minako-san was never mad at you.&quot; She said and Kira made a 
face.

&quot;Actually, she had a bit of an odd gleam in her eyes when she told me it 
was okay. Blasted doujin writers&#133;&quot; Kira said and Setsuna sweat-dropped. 
She took Kira&#39;s hand and with a smile they started on their way out, 
meeting with Haruka, Michiru and Hotaru near the door.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s been a long day. What do you say we all head home?&quot; Haruka 
asked and Kira smirked.

&quot;Are you sure we should go home? I mean, it is a weekend tonight.&quot; 
Michiru flushed lightly Haruka&#39;s face turned slightly sour.

&quot;It should be okay. We&#39;re both a bit too tired tonight considering that 
someone kept us up last night.&quot; She grumbled and it was Setsuna&#39;s turn 
to flush as Kira laughed sheepishly. Hotaru just rolled her eyes and 
trotted along side her parents, laughing lightly with them as they 
walked out the door.</pre>
