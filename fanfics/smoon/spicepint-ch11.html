<h1>Spice with a Pint of Life (part 11 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Rei and Minako sat on the bed while their clothes lay scattered on the 
floor to the side.

Both girls sat apart, facing each other. Neither of them spoke, feeling 
that any words would fail to describe what either of them felt right 
then. The situation they found themselves in was something too 
wonderful, familiar and new all at once. Their relationship had existed 
some time ago in the past but this was a new life, a new existence only 
with the same feelings.

Rei&#39;s gaze was fixed on a spot on the bed sheets, taking everything in. 
The coolness of the room was causing goosebumps to appear on her arms, 
fueling an inner desire to huddle close with Minako right there and 
then. She wanted to feel the other woman against her, to feel the warmth 
of her body against hers to convince herself this wasn&#39;t a dream. She 
wanted to hear Minako whisper her name. What she wanted...what Hino Rei 
wanted...was to love and be loved.

Is it too much to ask for? Rei thought to herself.

Minako&#39;s hands loosely gripped the bed sheets while listening to her own 
heartbeat pounding in her chest. It was fast...but she was happy. 
Ecstatic even. After waiting and searching all this while for the one 
person to fill the emptiness in her heart, the one person who was the 
other half to her soul. I&#39;ve finally found her. Minako felt a warmth 
feeling grow inside her chest and spread throughout the rest of her body 
with that one simple thought. No, we&#39;ve found each other...

&quot;Mina...&quot; Rei broke the silence.

Minako looked up at the utterance of her name, loving the way it rolled 
off Rei&#39;s tongue. &quot;Rei...&quot; She softly spoke, sending similar shivers 
down Rei&#39;s spine. It wasn&#39;t the cold this time.

Taking the initiative Minako gently pushed Rei down on the bed. The way 
Rei&#39;s eyes looked up at her, the way the miko&#39;s body trembled although 
they weren&#39;t touching brought realization to Minako. Rei was scared. To 
be this much deprived of love...The blonde woman bitterly regretted 
leaving Rei alone for so long.

&quot;It&#39;s all right Rei, I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot; Minako promised. She could feel 
the other woman relax slightly upon hearing her soothing words.

Slowly Minako lowered herself down onto Rei, bit by bit, allowing the 
raven-haired woman time to adjust, until they lay completely atop of one 
another. Minako&#39;s head to fell into the crook of Rei&#39;s neck and was 
supported by the priestess and a soft pillow.

Silence

The two of them stayed there for a few minutes, listening to each 
other&#39;s breathing and to their hearts beating together.

Rei breathed in Minako&#39;s perfume, trying to imprint it deep within her 
memories. The way their bodies fit into each other&#39;s delighted the miko, 
bringing a greater hope that perhaps they were meant for each other. It 
was something she wanted to believe with all her heart. To believe that 
there was someone out there for you was one thing but having that 
someone being your best friend and past lover was an indescribable joy.

Rei&#39;s arms then came up and gently encircled around Minako&#39;s waist, 
lightly pressing them together. Feeling that Rei was ready, Minako 
brought her head back up and made eye contact with the other woman, 
searching for the go ahead. She didn&#39;t need to look far. Seeing this in 
Rei&#39;s eyes, Minako leaned in and gently brushed their lips together.

There was another pause. For a moment both woman felt their breaths 
intermingling, tickling their faces. And then their lips met again in a 
full kiss. Minako&#39;s tongue slid into Rei&#39;s mouth and their tongues 
touched, sending something electric through both of their bodies.

The kiss then deepened.

When they parted for air Minako began to kiss down the one side of Rei&#39;s 
neck, careful to watch for any hesitation in the other woman. She would 
not force Rei to go further than she was comfortable with.

Minako soon reached Rei&#39;s chest and paused to glimpse up at the woman&#39;s 
face. Rei&#39;s eyes were closed yet by the way her body would quiver under 
Minako&#39;s touch the blonde knew that Rei knew where she was.

&quot;I&#39;m right here...&quot; Minako brought up a hand and gently stroked Rei&#39;s 
cheek, reassuring her the best she could. &quot;How do you feel? Do you want 
me to go on?&quot;

Without whispering a word, Rei slightly opened her eyes and gave a small 
nod. She trusts me...Minako realized. The blonde was determined not to 
betray that trust, not as her leader but her lover.

Rei gasped when she felt Minako take her right nipple into her mouth and 
massaged her left breast with one hand. Instinctively she tensed but 
then she allowed the new sensation wash over her. Soft moans left her 
mouth. Every once in awhile she called out her lover&#39;s name, especially 
when the blonde switched to the other breast, eager to lavish as much 
attention as its twin received.

With her eyes closed Rei soon felt Minako&#39;s finger travel down south, 
skimming her skin lightly along the way. Rei&#39;s hips automatically bucked 
up when Minako stopped short.

&quot;M-Mina-chan, p-please...&quot; The heat had built up and was growing 
unbearable. Rei needed this.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Minako asked again. Once again Rei nodded.

Minako tentatively slipped one finger into Rei&#39;s heat, eliciting a loud 
moan from the other woman immediately. Feeling bolder, Minako added 
another digit and began to thrust them into her love. It had started 
slow...but it soon become faster and faster with Rei&#39;s urgent moans.

&quot;Mi----ah, ah...AH!&quot; Rei&#39;s moans escalated until she screamed Minako&#39;s 
name when waves of pleasure hit her. &quot;MIIIIIIIIIIIIINA!&quot;

Rei couldn&#39;t tell where anything was anymore. She felt lost, her mind 
clouded with this pleasurable sensation that caused her body to stiffen 
and shake uncontrollably.

&quot;Shhh...&quot; The blonde cooed as she brushed aside Rei&#39;s bangs, watching 
the woman come back down to Earth.

There was a pleasant silence as Rei&#39;s breathing steadied again.

&quot;Hah...hah...&quot;

Minako smiled at the sight and gave her love a peck on the forehead. 
&quot;Rei?&quot; She called to the woman.

Rei&#39;s movements stilled for a split second. When Minako blinked she 
found herself flipped onto her back and their positions reversed. She 
was startled to see the passion in Rei&#39;s amethyst eyes. &quot;Rei...&quot;

Hovering over her partner Rei blinked and tried to steady herself. She 
felt so many things, desire one of many as she eyed the woman under her. 
Golden blonde hair, the most beautiful set of cerulean eyes that she had 
ever laid eyes upon. A good heart to match her beauty. In Rei&#39;s eyes, 
Minako was perfect.

What about my heart?

Rei knew what she wanted but unsure of how to do it. Under her was a 
person, a human being with emotions and feelings. A goddess...The last 
thing she wanted to do was to hurt Minako.

Meanwhile Minako felt a blush creep across her cheeks under Rei&#39;s 
intense stare. She held her breath when Rei&#39;s hand touched her hand and 
slowly trailed up from it to her shoulder. The miko then did the same 
with her other hand. From there the raven-haired woman gentle ran her 
hands down her body, feeling every place, adventuring to where each 
curve would lead. Her silent ministrations left Minako&#39;s skin tingling 
and her heart racing.

Finally Rei followed Minako&#39;s earlier example. She kissed down one side 
of the blonde&#39;s neck and then switch to the other. Unlike Minako though, 
Rei momentarily stopped at Minako&#39;s collarbone and gently sucked on it, 
sure to leave a mark for later on.

In response Minako hissed for breath. Her slender fingers came up and 
buried themselves in Rei&#39;s raven hair, pulling the miko closer.

When Rei reached Minako&#39;s breast she took in one nipple and lightly 
sucked on it, while every so often she would alternate between nipping 
the hard nub and flicking her tongue against it. Her other hand 
carefully kneaded Minako&#39;s other breast with her index and middle 
finger. Soon she switched.

Minako on the other hand was left squirming under Rei, trying hard to 
keep back the string of moans but found it futile. Instead she began to 
voice her pleasure louder, often enough fighting for air, only to lose 
her breath as quickly as she gained. She just loved this woman so much 
and what she was doing to her.

Rei then moved down once more. She lowered herself to stare at her 
lover&#39;s most intimate part with curiosity.

&quot;Can I?&quot; She asked. When she felt Minako&#39;s fingers tighten in her hair 
she knew it was a yes.

Carefully Rei flicked her tongue between the lips and found something 
hard. The way the blonde twitched told her it was a good thing. The miko 
began to lap at it, making Minako scream.

She kept at it until she felt Minako push her downwards, eager for her 
to complete the journey.

This is... Rei inserted her tongue into the place Minako desired her to 
touch the most and tentatively tasted her fluids. They had a taste that 
Rei couldn&#39;t quite described. She did know however that she didn&#39;t 
dislike it.

When Rei felt Minako become more urgent she replaced her tongue with 
fingers and followed Minako&#39;s earlier motions.

The room was followed by another loud scream as Minako called Rei&#39;s name 
repeatedly. Rei continued to thrust into her love, slowing the rhythm as 
the sensation her partner experienced soon began to pass.

&quot;Mina...?&quot;

Rei brought herself back up and pulled the blonde woman close to her 
chest, hugging her protectively. She could feel her partner shake with 
the pleasant trembles, her chest heaving for air as she herself once 
had.

Comfortingly Rei brought up a hand and brushed it through Minako&#39;s hair 
and then stroked the woman&#39;s face. She couldn&#39;t help but blush when 
Minako slowly opened her eyes, watching her with complete adoration.

Without saying a word they then brought their lips together again in a 
soft kiss, feeling satisfied and content.

After they parted Minako softly asked, &quot;Have you ever been loved?&quot;

Rei tightened her arms around the woman and sincerely answered, &quot;Never 
in the same way or as much as you loved me.&quot;

&quot;I still do love you...&quot; Minako gave a sigh and blinked sleepily as she 
leaned her head against Rei&#39;s chest.

Thank you... Tears stung Rei&#39;s eyes. &quot;And I love you.&quot; Rei bent down and 
gave her love a peck atop of her head.

They both continued to hold each other and soon fell asleep in each 
other&#39;s arms. As they drifted off they couldn&#39;t help but think that 
whatever awaited them the next day, they would surely face it together.
