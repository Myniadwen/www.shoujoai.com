<h1>Thunderstorm</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yarassno.html">YaRassno</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hi. I have here a short, short story written especially for ChibiUsa and 
Hotaru fans. It is not a hentai piece - sorry, guys.  ^^; It&#39;s a nice one 
though.

Anyway, enjoy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChibiUsa woke up with a start.  She thought she heard a rumbling noise 
from somewhere far away, and she tensed with anxiety. [That sounds like a 
thunderstorm approaching!]  Nervously, she sat up and looked around.

The room was dark except for a soft glow of moonlight steaming in through 
the window. As her eyes adjusted to the dim light she blinked in surprise. 
[Wait a moment - this is not my bedroom!]  For some moments she 
contemplated her unfamiliar surroundings, wondering whose room she was 
sleeping in.   Just then ChibiUsa noticed several very pretty unlit lamps 
of different shapes and sizes on the dresser in the corner. [Oh, yeah. 
That&#39;s right - I&#39;m staying overnight at Hotaru&#39;s house this weekend!] 
This was not the first time ChibiUsa spend the night there, however. 
Hotaru often traveled with her parents, Haruka and Michiru, so the young 
girls didn&#39;t get together as much as they wished. So, staying overnight 
at each other&#39;s place whenever possible was always a special occasion for 
them.

Shifting around on a spare futon they had brought in the room for her, 
ChibiUsa looked at her friend curled up under the covers in the bed close 
by.  The thin, dark-haired 14-year-old girl was sleeping quite soundly. 
Hotaru always looked so peaceful in her sleep, like she have no worries 
whatsoever.

&quot;Hotaru-chan...&quot;  ChibiUsa said softly because she could still hear 
rumbling noises out there, and it was scaring her.  When Hotaru did not 
wake up ChibiUsa leaned over and tired again.  &quot;Hotaru-chan!&quot; she said, a 
little louder this time.  Finally, the slumbering girl stirred and her 
eyes fluttered open.  

&quot;What...&quot; Hotaru mumbled sleepily. &quot;ChibiUsa-chan, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;  

&quot;Can you hear it?&quot;  ChibiUsa whispered anxiously, but then the rumblings 
stopped. 

&quot;Mmm?&quot;  Hotaru sat up in her bed and tilted her head to one side as 
though listening.  &quot;I don&#39;t hear anything. What is it?&quot;

&quot;Wait,&quot; ChibiUsa said.  After a while, the rumbling sounds resumed.  She 
wasn&#39;t sure, but it sounded as though the noise level had increased 
significantly. &quot;There!&quot; She said, her eyes wide with fear, &quot;Hotaru-chan, 
that&#39;s a thunderstorm!&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s face cleared. &quot;Oh. So you&#39;re scared of lightning, ne? Don&#39;t 
worry, it&#39;s really nothing to be frightened of, ChibiUsa-chan,&quot; She 
paused, looked at ChibiUsa and laughed softly. &quot;I&#39;m surprised at you!  
You are 13-year-old and a Sailor Senshi, agent of love and justice ready 
to fight fearlessly against all kinds of enemies - yet you flee at the 
sound of the approaching storm?&quot;

Blushing, ChibiUsa pouted;  &quot;Gee, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re teasing me. 
Thanks a lot!&quot;  

&quot;Sorry, I guess I shouldn&#39;t tease you like that,&quot; Hotaru grinned at her 
young friend,  &quot;But then again, that&#39;s what the best friends are for!&quot; 

BOOOOM!  BOOOOOM!  With a yelp of fright at those tremendous thunderclaps, 
ChibiUsa jumped out of her futon and dove into Hotaru&#39;s bed, clinging to 
her friend as the rain started pouring down and pelting heavily against 
the window panels. Flashes of lightning bathed the entire room in eerie 
light.

&quot;Whoa. There, there, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Hotaru said. She put her arms 
around Chibiusa in a gentle, reassuring hug and rocked her slowly forth 
and back.  &quot;Don&#39;t be scared, okay, ChibiUsa-chan?&quot;

ChibiUsa nodded slowly. Even so, she shuddered, whimpered a little at 
another resounding thunderclap and continued clutching tightly to Hotaru 
as if her very life depended on it. &quot;I can&#39;t help it. I guess I just 
don&#39;t like loud noises.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;ll be over soon,&quot; Hotaru said, rubbing the young girl&#39;s back 
soothingly.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; ChibiUsa snuggled against the raven-haired girl and sighed 
contentedly. &quot;I don&#39;t know why, but I really like being with you.&quot; She 
raised her head and looked into Hotaru&#39;s face. &quot;Know what? I always feel 
safe whenever you&#39;re around. I know you will not let anything happen to 
me.&quot;

&quot;Good. I&#39;m glad to hear that,&quot; Hotaru said, pleased that her friend has 
so much confidence in her. &quot;I like being with you too, ChibiUsa-chan.&quot;

ChibiUsa rested her head on Hotaru&#39;s shoulder. She was becoming sleepy 
now. &quot;And by the way, you smell good, too...&quot;

Hotaru chuckled, pulled the covers up around ChibiUsa and held her gently 
until the pink-haired girl drifted off to sleep in her arms in spite of 
the rumbling thunderstorm. She glanced down and smiled, feeling  - not 
for the first time - new and oddly pleasant warmth whenever ChibiUsa was 
with her.   She didn&#39;t know why she felt that way lately - she had hugged 
ChibiUsa this close so many times before in the past. All the same, it 
sure felt good.   [I wonder if she&#39;s feeling the same thing about me?] 
Hotaru mused. [Who knows? Perhaps one day we will find out.] She pushed 
the waylaid strands of pink hair out of her friend&#39;s small face then, on 
a sudden impulse, she bent over and ever so softly as not to wake the 
young girl, Hotaru kissed ChibiUsa on the forehead. [ChibiUsa-chan, my 
dear friend - I love you and I will always protect you.  You can be sure 
of that.]

The rain continued to run down the window panels in ever-changing 
patterns.  ChibiUsa remained asleep but Hotaru lay awake for a long while 
with a small dreamy smile, holding her friend next to her and absently, 
lovingly stroking the soft pink hair.
