<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 34 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch33.html">Back to Part 33</a><p><u> (Martian Shuttle, Rei)</u></p><p><i>Things became pretty hectic after that. Unknown 
to the celebrating civilians, the preparations had already been long underway. 
</i></p><p><i>It took twenty-minutes to declare the unification of our forces, and another 
ten minutes to give out the orders and commands. </i></p><p><i>Eight hours after the given 
commands: Inventory of all our available resources had commenced; food, water, clothing, 
ammunition and outfit gear. The recruitment list was piling up by the minute and we needed 
everything we could get our hands on. </i></p><p><i>Twenty-four hours after the given 
commands: All participating military combatants were boarded onto the transport shuttles. 
Fifteen minutes to review the reports, five minutes between piles... Two minutes to send 
word to Zen to increase docking capacity through the opening of another ten ports. Thirty 
seconds to sign the signature and grant approval, one and a half seconds to 
breathe…</i></p><p>…<i>Minako…</i></p><p><i>The preparation for battle was always strenuous 
but something at this scale...it’s in a league of its own. </i></p><p><i>Our strategic 
meeting came soon enough. Given the extent of our duties we were forced to conduct the 
meeting online, via projection. It was painfully obvious to everyone there that the mass 
majority of us were severely sleep-deprived. But that wasn’t about to stop any of us from 
listening to Setsuna’s careful instructions.</i></p><p>“<i>...Uranus and Mars’s units will 
concentrate on breaking through the enemy’s front line, while Jupiter and Venus are to 
provide secondary support. We will delay the second wave until I give the signal. Do 
</i><i><u>not</u></i><i> give the command to attack until you are instructed to. Although 
power is important in battle, patience and strategy is what determines the victor in 
war.”</i></p><p><i>While the majority of us would focus on offence, Ami and Michiru’s people 
would be in charge of the backup support. Mercury, due to their technology and their 
advanced computer intelligence, will record statistical data on the field and relay those 
results to the tacticians in regular, periodic updates. Neptune’s forces on the other hand 
will be split into two units-- a small minority will join the battlefield in the fourth 
wave, after Earth, while the majority of their force will be assigned to medical 
aid.</i></p><p><i>Lastly, in the third wave... Earth will attempt to clear a path through 
the weakened enemy forces for the infiltration.</i></p><p>“<i>The palace is our main 
objective. Apollo has hidden himself within it and is using it as his stronghold. It is very 
likely to be guarded by an army of his assassins. There is also high probability that we may 
be outnumbered. However… if we can infiltrate and defeat Apollo, their source of power, then 
the war will instantly end.”</i></p><p>Rei was sitting at the tactician table in the head 
Martian shuttle. It was a long, rectangular table that sat squarely in the middle of the 
lower floor in the bridge. Up until now, the room had been relatively quiet; many of her 
soldiers had been doing self-preparations, ie. final gear checks, weapon maintenance, 
whatever they needed. She couldn’t be sure if some of them prayed, but she wouldn’t have 
batted an eye if they did now. The overhead projector in the bridge displayed the Sun, their 
final battleground. Although they were still at a distance away, the anticipation that it 
was stirring up in the troops was not a good one—even by Martian standards.</p><p><i>The 
Sun…</i></p><p>The planet fiercely spat its flames at them upon their approach as if were 
daring the ‘infant’ alliance to discover what hid behind its imaginary guard. It took a 
question from one of the troops to snap Rei out of her trance. Once the matter had been 
dealt with, she remembered that she had much more to do. The pile of papers in front of her 
had diminished significantly over the past few hours, but there was still a handful and she 
was beginning to get tired; the words on the papers were starting to blur in her 
vision.</p><p>Suddenly there was a light pressure on her shoulder. She turned her head to 
see that it was Zen.</p><p>“What is it?” The question had come out harsher than she had 
intended it, but her officer didn’t even flinch.</p><p>“Still working away at it Your 
Majesty?” He gestured to the pile.</p><p>“Something like that,” she muttered 
back.</p><p>“You know...if you’d like, I could do those for you while you go and 
rest.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’ve been working non-stop since the alliance’s declaration. 
If you keep this up, you may not be able fight to your max potential in battle. Besides, 
isn’t that why you promoted me to the position of Commander? So I could help you with this 
kind of stuff?”</p><p>Rei eyed him with a disbelieving stare. She couldn’t imagine why 
someone would be so excited to do paperwork, but then again she supposed she was similar, 
granted, less expressive than he was, when she was given more responsibility for the first 
time.</p><p>“Hmm... All right, since you want to do paperwork so badly, here.” She cut the 
stack in two and gave one half to him.</p><p>“Huh? But--”</p><p>“I appreciate your help Zen, 
but I can finish these by myself.” She rose from her chair. “If you need me, I’ll be in my 
quarters.”</p><p>“Oh. O-Of course! Thank you, Your Highness!”</p><p><i>...Sheesh... The help 
I have to deal with. </i>Rei didn’t know why she smiled at that. She was on her way to her 
quarters when she ran across Nozomi. For some reason the child was sitting all by lonesome 
in the corridor.</p><p><i>Hm? Is that...? What is she sulking about now?</i> Rei had a good 
enough mind to walk right on by and leave her be, but, despite herself, she stopped right in 
front of the girl.</p><p>“So?” Nozomi didn’t even look up at the question. “What’s the 
problem now?”</p><p>When she remained silent, Rei sighed and dropped against the floor 
beside her. Nozomi quickly turned her head to stare at her superior with disbelieving eyes; 
she hadn’t expected her to actually stop on her account.</p><p>“I asked you a question and 
I’m not leaving until you answer it.”</p><p>“And you thought I act like a child...” the girl 
mumbled despite herself.</p><p>“Well, that’s because you are one.” She noticed the girl 
tense. Had that hit the mark?</p><p>“...I don’t like it.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“I don’t like 
being a kid! I wish I was more grown up like you and Zen.” She gasped when she realized what 
she had just said, and then turned her head away in shame.</p><p><i>Oh great, now I did 
it.</i> She thought to herself. <i>Now she won’t let me do 
anything!</i></p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Why do you want to be grown up so 
badly?”</p><p>“W-Well... It just doesn’t seem fair. You and Zen...You’re now the ruler and 
Zen is the Commander. But me...?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“I’m not even a soldier...”</p><p>“I 
thought you didn’t want to be in the military.”</p><p>“Yeah, but--!! That was--”</p><p>Rei 
adjusted her sitting position. “Nozomi, do you remember our deal? If you train for five 
years and prove at the end of it that you’re stronger than your military counterparts, then 
you’re free to choose. If you really want to become a soldier later on, then you 
can.”</p><p>“I haven’t forgotten. It’s just...I want to fight <i>now.</i> Even though I 
helped you guys out on Uranus, Zen won’t let me help out this time. He said I was too 
young...”</p><p><i>Ah, I see. So that’s the problem. </i></p><p>“I agree. You are too 
young...” she saw the girl lower her head, “...for that position.”</p><p>“Huh? What do you 
mean?”</p><p>“What you need to understand, is that this battle will be very different from 
the one on Uranus. Our enemy will not be human, Nozomi. They’re monsters.”</p><p>“Monsters?” 
She saw Rei fall silent and wondered what she was thinking. “But even if that’s true, you’re 
all going to fight anyway! I want to fight too!”</p><p>Rei shot her a sharp look and the 
girl clamped up. “On Uranus, I acknowledge that you were on the front line with Zen...but 
you were allowed to go because it was intended to be a peacekeeping mission. But this 
upcoming battle... it will be a vicious fight where both sides fully intend to wipe the 
other out.” She looked away and Nozomi felt the pressure around her drop.</p><p><i>Anyone 
can die in this fight. We were just lucky that none of us have so far.</i></p><p>“Due to the 
alliance, we have more experienced fighters now. They will be more suitable at the front 
lines than someone of your caliber. You’ll just get in the way...”</p><p><i>I knew it.</i> 
Nozomi was so frustrated that she felt tears starting to sting her 
eyes.</p><p>“However...there is something you can do. It’s not as exciting as the front 
lines, but it’s a very important task.”</p><p>“You mean be part of the cheering squad?” She 
asked sulkily.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>This piqued the girl’s interest. “You mean I’d actually be 
doing something?! Well, what is it? Oh, c’moooon...Don’t keep me waiting! Spit it out 
already!”</p><p>“It’s guard duty.” She saw the girl blink, but as she continued on there was 
excitement growing in her dark eyes. “The person is a friend of mine, but she tends to be 
somewhat absent-minded at times so I could really use an extra pair of eyes on her. She’s 
also a Goddess. Are you interested?”</p><p>“What...?” <i>So, the person she wants me to 
guard is a friend of hers? AND she’s a Goddess? </i>“Of course I am! You can count on me, 
Sir!”</p><p>“Excellent. I shall inform her immediately then.” Rei remarked as she stood up. 
“In the meantime, go to the bridge and inform Zen. Have him equip you with the necessary 
armor and equipment. If there are any problems, tell him to speak to me. 
Understand?”</p><p>“Yes!” She was about to speed off when Nozomi remembered something. “Oh, 
I mean...Of course, Your Majesty.”</p><p>Rei watched her give a quick bow and then dash off 
down the corridor in high spirits. She almost chuckled at the sight.</p><p><i>She’s an 
interesting kid. </i></p><p>“Now, let’s see...I have to make a call and then get back to the 
paperwork.” She sighed. <i>I guess a ruler’s job is never done.</i></p><p>As she walked 
towards her quarters, she couldn’t help but wonder how the others were fairing.</p><p><u> 
(Uranus Shuttle, Haruka)</u></p><p>Haruka gazed out of her bedroom window with a 
scrutinizing gaze. Beside her, emitted from her communicator, was Michiru’s projection. The 
ruler of Neptune analyzed her partner with a neutral face, being receptive to every detail 
and movement that the other woman unconsciously made; the occasional shuffle of her weight, 
the half-hearted sighs-- even the soft swaying of her sandy blonde hair. The serene 
atmosphere that the warrior carried about her was being committed to memory.</p><p>“Who 
would have thought…” Haruka finally mumbled. “…that the Sun we see isn’t just a hot, flaming 
ball of gas, but an illusion?”</p><p>“Yes, it does boggle the mind. However, it would 
explain how Ami’s people were able to design the Planet Core Defence System that all of us 
use now. I suspect that they must have modeled it after the Sun’s technology.”</p><p>“Yeah, 
that’s true. But knowing that isn’t going to help us. The Sun’s defence system is a lot 
stronger than any of our own. Setsuna said that it could take all of us to break its barrier 
and I believe her...You can sense it too, can’t you? The power that’s coming from that 
thing, he’s really down there...” Haruka shifted her gaze and locked eyes with Michiru. “It 
could be a rough battle ahead of us.”</p><p>The two women silently regarded each other, 
wordlessly contemplating the other’s stern face. No words were spoken; nothing was said; 
lips never moved. The warm beating of a heart sped up and cheeks blushed when emotions 
reached across the space to their other half. In a blink of an eye, their world dimmed and 
fell away. They were standing before one another now, both of them wrapped in a thin veil of 
light.</p><p>Nothing else, no one else…</p><p>Slowly, simultaneously, they both raised their 
hands and reached out. When hands clasped and fingers intertwined, smiles were finally 
revealed and eyes softened. One thought, one single precious thought…</p><p><i>I love 
you…</i></p><p><u>(Mercury Shuttle, Ami)</u></p><p>Ami typed furious in front of a monitor, 
completely forgetting everything else as she entered a new series of data points and created 
the necessary graphs. Figures flashed before her on the blue face-screen; in its center 
there were varying statistics based on the strength of their forces and their current 
provisions, while to the side her inbox flashed with a pile of online reports that awaited 
her approval. In a mechanical like fashion, the woman opened, read and replied to each 
message. Much of the time she frowned as she requested for additional information from the 
sender or suggested an alternative to the plan. On and on it went. It seemed to be a 
never-ending cycle, yet Mercury’s ruler knew she couldn’t stop now; she wasn’t the only one 
who was working hard. All around her people rushed back and forth-- either they were 
messengers delivering hand written calculations or they were technicians delivering the 
essential mechanical parts needed to upgrade the system. It was the everyday routine—but in 
a heightened frenzy.</p><p>Ami finished up the last set of reports. Upon clicking the send 
button, she leaned back into her seat with a relieved sigh and disengaged her 
headgear.</p><p><i>Whew. Now, I just need to wait for their replies…</i></p><p>She was about 
to relax when her inbox blipped again. Ami inwardly sighed, but when she saw who it was from 
she immediately sat up.</p><p>“Oh. It’s from Rei.” She had begun to skim through the 
attachments when something cool pressed into the side of her cheek and made her 
jump.</p><p>“Wha---?” She whirled on the spot as the cloth was drawn away, and found herself 
staring up at an innocent pair of green eyes blinking back. She almost couldn’t believe 
it.</p><p>“Makoto? W-What are you doing here?” <i>Oh no... I must have been working on those 
reports for too long. I’m hallucinating now. </i></p><p>“Ahh…Well, I was supposed to send 
you my report, but our computers are sorta undergoing maintenance repairs right now. So, I 
came to give it to you myself! But...I can’t stay long though…”</p><p>“Oh, I see...” Ami 
mouthed as the taller woman handed her a disc. She turned her chair around and popped it 
into the system. “Hmm...I was wondering where this was.”</p><p>“Thought I forgot, didn’t 
you?”</p><p>“Well, it was a plausible explanation.” She lightly joked back.</p><p>Ami re-did 
the upgrades in a blink of an eye. In no time at all, she finished both tasks; she sent an 
approved documents back to their Martian friend and returned the disc back to its 
owner.</p><p>“It’s really busy over here, huh?” Jupiter commented as she pocketed the disc. 
There were rushing workers all around them.</p><p>“Yes. We’ve been working on the 
preparations even before the official declaration was made. It is a difficult job, but we 
are all doing the best we can. It’s all I can really ask of 
them.”</p><p>‘...’</p><p>“Umm...Is there... something bothering you, Makoto? Is there 
something on my face?”</p><p>“You’ve been pushing yourself again, haven’t you?” Makoto 
gently slid a hand under the other woman’s chin and carefully pulled her face up just until 
she could see her better. It was deceiving at a distance, but Ami was covered in a thin 
layer of perspiration and her eyes were slightly unfocused.</p><p><i>I thought so.</i> She 
narrowed her green eyes.</p><p>“Hold still.” When she brought up the face cloth again, Ami’s 
began to protest—only to be shushed and gently pushed back into her chair. Makoto sternly 
looked at her with an almost motherly expression before shaking her head in a ‘what am I 
going to do with you’ way and continued with her task.</p><p>“Have you eaten 
lately?”</p><p>“Well…No…But I must finish the work that is assigned to me.”</p><p>“Yeah… 
but, you’re entitled to a break every once n’ awhile too, you know? You aren’t a 
robot.”</p><p>“Makoto...”</p><p>“I know your work is important, but if you don’t take care 
of yourself, then you’re just going to burn yourself out. There are people that worry about 
you, you know?”</p><p>Ami averted her gaze. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“No. There’s no need to 
apologize…”</p><p>Makoto carefully considered what to say next. At times, she was 
uncomfortable with her words. How could express them so that Ami could understand?</p><p>“I 
know that there’s a big burden on you right now. Everyone is sending you all their reports 
and you have to go through each and every one of them just to make sure that we aren’t 
exceeding our limit. It’s a big job… there’s no doubt about it. But... can’t you rely on 
others just a little bit more?”</p><p>“…?”</p><p>“My father always told me, that taking 
pride in a skill that you are really good at isn’t a bad thing… but there can be times where 
that kind of pride can also become an unbearable burden. You start to think that you need to 
take the whole world onto your shoulders, like you can’t afford to stop or slow down, 
because if you do… you’d feel worthless.”</p><p>…<i>Just being wanted…</i></p><p>…<i>To feel 
needed…</i></p><p>“…”</p><p>“Can’t you see, Ami? You haven’t eaten and you probably haven’t 
slept at all these last few days. You’re hurting yourself! Can’t you let someone else take 
over for a bit while you take a short break? I know they might not be as fast as you are but 
it’s do-able, isn’t it?” She took her hands into hers. “Please? I’m really worried about 
you…”</p><p>Ami wearily stared at the pleading eyes. She did feel tired, and perhaps hungry 
too if she gave herself a chance to even think about food. Now that she did think about it, 
she didn’t know how long she had been working. When was the last time she actually relaxed? 
Her memory of the last few days was like a blur to her. But what she did know was standing 
right in front of her; the warmth that touched her as it did those many years ago. 
Understanding, unconditional love…</p><p>Makoto heart almost burst with joy when she watched 
her friend flag someone over and instructed them on what to do. She was secretly even more 
floored by the smile that graced Ami’s lips as she helped the shorter woman onto her 
feet.</p><p>“Come on, let’s go to the kitchen and get you something to eat. I’ll whip up 
something special for you!”</p><p>Ami weakly nodded and leaned against Makoto for support as 
she allowed herself to be led away. She couldn’t help but feel calm, and… happy.</p><p>With 
a content sigh she thought to herself,</p><p><i>What would I do without you, 
Makoto?</i></p><p><u>(Martian Shuttle, Rei)</u></p><p>Rei’s quarters were usually silent. 
The stack of papers that she had brought in with her lay atop of the desk, but there was no 
one sitting at the chair. To the far side of the room, the woman had dozed off on the floor. 
She was sitting upright against the tip of the bed with her sword by her side. However, it 
was not a peaceful sleep.</p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p><i>Her eyes were closed, but somehow she 
knew it was dark. However, it was not about to stay dark for very long.</i></p><p><i>Rei 
opened her eyes a crack when a light flickered in the darkness. There was a small, circular 
orange flame hovering in the space directly in front of her. Before she could comprehend its 
meaning, more lights lit up all around her. Soon, she was surrounded by a circle of them. 
</i></p><p><i>The woman sunk into a defensive position and waited for one of them attack, 
but the lights merely hovered in their respective places. </i></p><p><i>In the distance, 
something large shifted. Rei was startled when the ground began to shake. A terrible 
screaming filled her ears as the flames began to alternate between orange and blue. 
</i></p><p>‘<i>W-What’s going on?!’</i></p><p><i>She gasped when she caught a glimpse of the 
being staring back at her from the shadows. The flames instantly scattered when a two-headed 
dragon lunged forward and began to attack them. </i></p><p>‘<i>No! Get away from 
it!’</i></p><p><i>She reached out just as one of the flames was extinguished by the 
creature’s jaws.</i></p><p>‘<i>No!’</i></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p>“No!” Rei awoke with a 
start. Still a little shaky, the woman scanned her surroundings and recalled that she was in 
her quarters. She slumped back against the bed in relief. “Hah! Hah...hah...”</p><p><i>I 
guess I fell asleep... But...that dream!</i></p><p>She was distracted when there was a 
distinct bleeping coming from her clothing. Rei rummaged through the pocket and pulled out 
her communicator. She recognized the channel code, but she was reluctant to open it at the 
time. Did she really want Minako to see her like this? Despite herself, she pressed the 
button and Minako’s projection appeared.</p><p>“Hey. Long time no see.” Minako said wearily. 
She did a double take at Rei. “Did I call at a bad time?”</p><p>“No, not really... I 
was...just taking a nap.”</p><p>“A nap?! Awww... Lucky bum!”</p><p>Rei had to smile at that. 
“I take it that you guys are busy?”</p><p>“That’s an understatement.” Minako shrugged. “All 
of tacticians are in a meeting right now to finalize our strategies. It’s pretty intense in 
here.”</p><p>“Heh, I believe it. Who’s over there?”</p><p>“Well, aside from the informants, 
we have Taya, Setsuna and Michiru.”</p><p>“Wait. Did you just say Setsuna?” Rei saw Minako 
nod. “How long has she been over there?”</p><p>“Umm...well, for awhile now. I think ever 
since our meeting ended.”</p><p><i>...Shit.</i> <i>That stubborn woman is going to work 
herself to death! </i></p><p>Minako saw her partner frown. “I know. I don’t think she’s 
taken a single break since this entire thing began. I mean, I’ve tried telling her to take 
it easy, but she just won’t listen.” She glanced over her shoulder at something behind her 
and then turned attention back to Rei. “She’s working with Taya right now. I’m not sure what 
they’re working on, but I’m getting this feeling that 
something’s...wrong.”</p><p>“Wrong?”</p><p>“How to put it...? Setsuna is looking calm like 
she usually does, but...I’m getting the feeling that she isn’t telling us something. It’s 
not that I don’t trust her, it’s just...She’s been working really hard. It’s like she’s 
trying to work out every possible ‘what if’ there is since she got here. I dunno, it just 
might be me.”</p><p>“It could be. I mean, she is the head tactician. If there’s a flaw in 
her plans then there could be some pretty terrible consequences for the rest of 
us.”</p><p>“Yeah...”</p><p>The both fell silent.</p><p>“...So...what did you want to talk 
about?” Rei asked.</p><p>“Well, Setsuna said that we’ll be moving out soon... So, I was just 
wondering how you were holding up. I mean, we haven’t spoken since the declaration. And, 
umm...Also, I just wanted to say thanks for your support the other day. It meant a lot to 
me.”</p><p>Rei blinked. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. You pulled through on your 
own.”</p><p>“Hah!” Minako grinned. “In any case...Seriously, how are you doing? I mean...you 
aren’t nervous at all, are you?”</p><p>“No. Not at all...” She saw Minako stare back 
expectantly.</p><p>“Honestly.”</p><p>The word made the Martian twitch. 
“Well...”</p><p>“C’mon.”</p><p>“I was just thinking...”</p><p>“About?”</p><p>Rei took a deep 
breath. It was now or never.</p><p>“There’s been something on my mind for awhile. Before we 
go and fight, there’s something that I need to know. Would you hate me... if I didn’t become 
a God?”</p><p>She could hear a silence from the other end of the line.</p><p>“...Why are you 
asking me this?”</p><p>“Think about it. Even though the people of Mars follow me, I’m still 
only human. If we survive this war, I’ll eventually grow old and die...if I’m lucky.” She 
added and took a deep breath. “After the war is over, my condition will continue to weaken 
me and I won’t be able to stop it.”</p><p><i>Setsuna’s right...</i></p><p>“Not even the 
medicine I’m taking can stop it. In a way...That’s worse than being with a human, isn’t 
it?”</p><p>“...You’re right.”</p><p>Rei tensed.</p><p>“One day you are going to grow old. 
You’ll probably get grumpier, and maybe, you’ll complain about your appearance 
too.”</p><p>“Mina, I’m serious!” <i>Does she think this is a joke?</i></p><p>“I am 
too.”</p><p>Rei was startled when the woman met her eyes, nodding solemnly.</p><p>“I won’t 
deny it. Some things will change, no matter what we do...That’s just the way life is. But... 
even if everything else changes, the important things will stay the same. You’ll still be 
proud and courageous... You’ll still be protective of the people you love. Not to mention, 
you’ll always be a stubborn, hot-head who’ll never let me win at a game of cards.” She 
grinned. “...But... more importantly...you’ll always be honest with me, even if I can’t be 
honest with myself. I love you, Rei... I’m here for you now and I still will be even after 
this is all over.”</p><p>Rei wasn’t sure if she was breathing anymore.</p><p>“Besides, you 
can’t die on me. We have a promise, remember?” She winked.</p><p>When the woman found her 
voice again she said, “...Yeah...Don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten.”</p><p><i>It’s 
strange...even though this could be the last time we can speak to one another like this...I 
don’t feel sad at all. </i></p><p>“...Thanks Mina.”</p><p><u> (Earth Shuttle, 
Usagi)</u></p><p>With a solemn face, Usagi eyed the passing lights from inside of her 
shuttle quarters. As they approached their destination, there was an orange light filling 
the room. From the inside it could be mistaken as light from a sunset, but the woman saw its 
true face. The stars outside became dim due to its intensity, a grim reminder that they too 
were like the stars. Going against the Sun, it was very possible that they too may be 
swallowed by its might.</p><p>Usagi placed a remorseful hand against the cool 
glass.</p><p>“We’re getting closer...” she whispered.</p><p>“Mm...”</p><p>Hotaru was sitting 
on one of the beds with a pensive expression upon her face. Despite the nearing danger, 
unlike the others, she was calm.</p><p>“Did you get Rei’s message?” She asked.</p><p>“Mm. 
She said that she would be sending a guard over. Though, I’m not really sure why...” She 
never noticed flicker of emotion in her sibling’s eyes. “Hey, Hotaru… I’ve been wondering 
about this for awhile now, but... what do you think our mother would say, if she knew what 
we were about to do?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“When everyone came to our home, Setsuna showed us a 
vision. Do you remember it? In it, our enemy, Apollo...said that he had nieces.” Hotaru felt 
her heart skip a beat. It couldn’t be. “Sir Ares also mentioned your name. He asked Apollo 
where you were, and...Artemis? That was our mother’s old name, wasn’t 
it?”</p><p>“Usagi!”</p><p>“Our enemy...the one who we are to kill is our 
Uncle.”</p><p>Hotaru couldn’t believe her ears. She almost cursed Setsuna for allowing Usagi 
to see that vision as well; her sister wasn’t as stupid as some people thought she 
was.</p><p>“If you knew all of that then why did you say you’d fight with us?”</p><p>Usagi 
was silent for a moment. “...Because...”</p><p>Hotaru stared hard at her twin. She could see 
the doubt in her eyes. For all her earlier speeches, words were just words after all. 
However, she strangely found that she was not disappointed by this. In fact, she felt a 
little relieved.</p><p>“Mother was… She was always praising you for your intentions, Usagi. 
And if she were here now, I truly believe that she still would.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Not 
only have you re-established connections with Earth, with our people, but you have also 
taken her place as ruler. I think she would be very proud of you.”</p><p>Usagi was 
momentarily speechless. “She loved us both.” She firmly said.</p><p>“In any case... You were 
right. Our enemy is our Uncle.” Their eyes met. “I’ll be honest with you. You don’t belong 
in the battlefield.”</p><p>Usagi’s blue eyes widened. “What are you saying?”</p><p>“Haruka 
was right. You may have power to fight, but you don’t have the will to use it. You should 
just stay here and wait until the battle is over.”</p><p>“But that’s--” She was about to say 
more but Hotaru’s raised a hand up for silence.</p><p>“It would also be...disrespectful to 
our mother’s sacrifice.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“She died so that you could live.”</p><p><i>I 
couldn’t stop myself. But because of her...I was able to snap out of it. That’s the only 
reason why they’re all alive now. She saved them. </i></p><p>“Stop and think about this for 
a second. If you go into battle, and somehow we both die...then who will be left to lead? 
The legacy that she left behind would be dead! And not only that...but you would let our 
people down as well. The people of Earth have placed their trust in you. If you perish in 
battle then who will be left to re-build the Kingdom?”</p><p>“...I...Well, that 
is...”</p><p>“Apollo’s power… you’ve never seen it before, have you? He is not a being to be 
taken lightly.”</p><p><i>He’s already seen you. There is no telling what he would do to you 
if the two of you met. That’s why...!! You must stay behind.</i></p><p>“On the battlefield, 
Usagi…Once you step onto that soil, into that tension, you will quickly realize that it is 
impossible to save everyone. In this war, no matter how much power you have, people will 
inevitably die. They will fall all around you, writhing and screaming in agony if they can 
scream at all. Do you really think you could handle such a reality? It is not as simple 
facing against a loved one in a practice match. It is far different from the training you 
have endured under Setsuna’s tutorage.”</p><p><i>Your heart is still slowly awakening to the 
reality which embraces you. You have finally accepted that you are the ruler, and there are 
people who look up to you and rely on you now. Try to understand that.</i></p><p><i>What am 
I trying to say is...</i></p><p>“Unlike our Mother you must protect yourself. You have to 
live! That’s why...I shall go and fight in your place.”</p><p>…<i>you cannot follow me 
anymore.</i></p><p>…<i>I’ll fight for you…</i></p><p>…………<i>..I’ll protect 
you…</i></p><p><b>Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!</b></p><p>“Ah. It looks like we are approaching the 
planet shield. Setsuna is summoning us.” Hotaru muttered. “I should get going. Stay here, 
all right?”</p><p>Without hesitation, Hotaru turned her back on her sister and began walking 
towards the door. She had reached the doorway when she heard Usagi say, “Wait.” Reluctantly, 
she turned around as the blonde ran up to her.</p><p>“Pinky swear.”</p><p>“What?” Hotaru 
blinked back. She wondered if Usagi was joking, but she was dead serious. The blonde lifted 
her hand up and determinedly waited for her reply.</p><p>“Pinky swear that you’ll come 
back.”</p><p><i>Oh.</i> A smile lit Hotaru’s face, but she could feel the heart in her chest 
clench at what she was about to say.</p><p>“...All right. I swear that I’ll come back.” She 
reached out and shook her hand.</p><p>Hotaru finally left the room and left her sister 
behind her. In her mind the promise had been a silly thing to do, but in her heart she was 
left torn up inside. She hadn’t thought it was possible to bear anymore scars, but she had 
just received another: The way her sister, the only remaining family that she had, looked at 
her so innocently as she saw her off—she was completely oblivious to what she was about to 
do.</p><p><i>Good-bye...Usagi...</i></p><p><u>(Shuttles orbiting the Sun)</u></p><p>Setsuna 
gave the signal and all of the rulers began to summon up their powers, leaving the rest of 
their people watching on in awe. With their auras shining brightly around them, at last 
contact was made with the shield; powerful streams of energy lashed out from the Sun in 
response and crashed head on with each individual. There was another flash of light as the 
energy streams were converted by each ruler into a massive extension of their power. In a 
blink of an eye the power was hurled back with such a force that the barrier instantly 
shattered.</p><p>“All units move out!”</p><p><u>(Sun, sometime after the 
landing)</u></p><p>“<b>Bzz…crackle…crack--- enemy radius detected…”</b> Mercury 
reported.</p><p>Just beyond the capital city’s limits, the Planetary Alliance was busily 
establishing camp. The terrain was as the tacticians had anticipated; there was desert as 
far as the eye could see, and high gusts of wind upon their arrival. While up above, there 
were swirling, dark gray clouds.</p><p>At the furthest most site Mars and Uranus troops were 
marching into formation. The soldiers obediently lined up in rows, all facing forwards as 
the wind blew sand into their faces. Despite the discomfort none of them moved. At the very 
front Zen and Uranus’s three commanders rallied morale, while Rei and Haruka huddled close 
together and strained to make-out Ami’s updates from the Ami.</p><p>“What was that Ami?!” 
Uranus shouted into her head speaker.</p><p>“She just said hold on,” Rei shouted back over 
the wind.</p><p><u>(Mercury Shuttle, far south of the City)</u></p><p>From the other end Ami 
signalled to her communications group to flick a switch on the back wall. The pair of twin 
turbines outside the station promptly sprung to life. As the blades gained momentum, energy 
was funnelled towards the radar plates—the crew within the shuttle cheered as a gigantic map 
of the terrain flew up on the overhead projector. It depicted where their forces had landed 
with yellow dots and the foreign signatures with red. However, it appeared that their 
infiltration had not been quite the surprise they were hoping it to be; the City of the Gods 
was completely surrounded by a growing mass of red, blinking lights.</p><p>“Radar initiated! 
Channels are successfully opened!”</p><p>“Red body mass is growing at a steady 2% rate! 
Error reading is greater than 4!”</p><p>“Adjust station one’s instruments to level ten, and 
lower station two’s to five!” Ami commanded.</p><p>“Adjustments complete! Now 
re-calculating… Red body mass is currently growing at a rate of 0.2! Error reading is now 
0.00008!”</p><p>Several more adjustments were made until Ami finally re-tried her 
communications.</p><p><u>(Sun, desert)</u></p><p><b>“</b><b>crac—Can everyone hear me 
now?”</b></p><p>“Yeah, we hear you loud n’ clear!” Haruka shouted back.</p><p>“<b>All right, 
then I will begin with the briefing. At this moment our computers are picking up enemy 
signatures surrounding the City in a circular-wide radius of approximately 3km. Also, it 
appears that their numbers are steadily increasing, but we haven’t been able to pin-point 
where they are coming from yet. Therefore... there is a high probability that our plan of 
action will continually be shifting throughout the fight. Both Setsuna and myself will relay 
the messages if there are any changes. I am now switching over to 
Setsuna!”</b></p><p><b>Bleep!</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>This is Setsuna speaking. As I am 
informed, the enemy has completely surrounded the City. Therefore, the direction in which we 
launch an attack is now irrelevant. To successfully infiltrate, we will simply need to clear 
a path long enough for you to get through. Our current plan of action is as follows. 
Concentrate heavily on long distance fire and try to draw a portion of their wall away from 
the main masses. We will try to diminish their numbers for now! …You may begin when you’re 
ready…”</b></p><p>Setsuna’s words barely trailed off when Haruka transformed.</p><p>“Uranus 
Planet Power, Make-Up!”</p><p><b>FLAAAAAAASH!</b></p><p>“A long distance attack huh?” The 
blonde loosened up her shoulders. Her green eyes were already flashing eagerly in 
anticipation. “Okay then! Are we all set to go?!”</p><p>Rei glanced behind them at their 
front line. She was going into battle with the knowledge that, once again, this was going to 
be it for many soldiers. As hard as it was, she nodded to Haruka and gave her the go 
ahead.</p><p>“World… 
SHAKING!”</p><p><i><b>Wham!</b></i><b>Whiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiiiIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRR</b></i><b>RRRRRR-----KABLAM!!</b></p><p>In 
the distance, a column of dust flew up into the air. From Ami’s side, there was a small hole 
in the enemy forces depicted on the map. Almost immediately she spotted reactionary 
movement.</p><p><b>“</b><b>The</b> <b>enemy forces are on the 
move!”</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Are they all moving or is it just the front flank?!” </b>Setsuna 
demanded.</p><p><b>“</b><b>Hold on... A quarter of their numbers are advancing towards Rei 
and Haruka’s position! Confirming... Yes, none of the others are budging. It is just the one 
section!”</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Initiate the Martian ‘Pincer’ formation! Surround them from 
all sides and then close in!”</b></p><p>“Does it ring a bell, Haruka?” Rei was practically 
grinning ear to ear as their enemy blackened the horizon.</p><p>“Shut it! You just better 
hope that it works this time!”</p><p>“It will if your soldiers can follow the 
formation!”</p><p>“Hmph. Well I guess we won’t know ‘till we try!” She sunk into an 
offensive position. “Here we go!!”</p><p><u>(Venusian Shuttle)</u></p><p>Where Setsuna was 
based she could barely make-out the backs of their front line from the camera monitors. 
There was something about their enemy’s movement that disturbed her.</p><p><i>Why did only 
the one section move? Do they mean it to be a defensive tactic to test us? Even so, their 
numbers can be easily worn down if their casualties exceed that of their 
growth.</i></p><p><i>Wait a minute.</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>Mar and Uranus have engaged with 
the enemy!” </b>Ami radioed in. <b>“Enemy numbers have been caught within the trap. Their 
numbers are rapidly decreasing!”</b></p><p>“…”</p><p><b>“</b><b>From the initial quarter we 
are approaching twenty-five percent remaining… nineteen percent… eighteen, 
seventeen…”</b></p><p>“…”</p><p><b>“…</b><b>Two…one… The enemy unit has successfully been 
defeated! There are still no movement from the remaining mass.”</b></p><p><i>The enemy unit 
has been annihilated, and yet none of the others have moved? Why? Are they purposely going 
to leave the one side vulnerable?</i></p><p>“Advance the front line one kilometer!” Setsuna 
ordered.</p><p>The green-haired woman stared at the disappearing front line until half a 
kilometer later…</p><p><b>“</b><b>Approaching target. Half a kilometer has been 
gained---Wait! Enemy radius is rapidly expanding! It’s covered the front line! No, the 
enemy’s territorial influence is passing us!”</b></p><p><i>It was a trap?!</i></p><p>“Pull 
back!”</p><p><b>“</b><b>It’s no use! Current projection has reached five 
kilometers!”</b></p><p>A scream erupted out of the shuttle’s speakers.</p><p>“What is 
happening out there?!”</p><p><u>(Front lines)</u></p><p>In the battlefield, the frontline 
was swamped by a red wind. The gust swept through their numbers and instantly induced 
light-headedness amongst the soldiers. However, it was only the beginning; the longer the 
Alliance’s troops were exposed to the toxic atmosphere, the greater the anxiety in them 
intensified. Many of them had begun to shiver despite being outfitted with armor; a sense of 
overwhelming hopelessness clawed its way deep into their bodies and drew many of them to 
whip their heads around as if an invisible presence were encircling them.</p><p>Rei blinked 
back against the sea of red, stubbornly resisting its effects. The unknown substance wasn’t 
quite as thick as she had initially perceived it to be, but it still inhibited her vision 
nonetheless. It was now nearly impossible to tell which direction to venture in without 
encountering harm’s way.</p><p>“Ami? Ami, can you hear me?” Rei tried contacting the woman. 
She cursed when all she received was static.</p><p><i>Damn it! Just what is this fog? It’s 
jamming up the radio signals!</i> The Martian barely noticed the inkling of a shadow forming 
behind her.</p><p>“Rei, behind you!” Haruka cried out. She instinctively dodged the 
assassin’s downward strike as Haruka lunged forward. The blonde took it down in one 
strike.</p><p><i><b>Slash!</b></i></p><p>Rei break-rolled and ran over to her companion’s 
side. “W-Where did that thing come from?”</p><p><i>I didn’t even sense it! Does this fog 
have anything to do with it?</i></p><p>Haruka gritted her teeth and whipped out her sword. 
“I dunno, but there are a ton more!”</p><p>“But that’s impossible! We were at least two 
kilometers away from where the enemy was, weren’t we?”</p><p>“Tell that to them! World… 
SHAKING!”</p><p><b>Kablam!</b></p><p><u>(Venusian shuttle)</u></p><p>Back at the Venusian 
shuttle, Ami was relaying the current statistics to Setsuna.</p><p><b>“</b><b>Enemy numbers 
are increasing exponentially within the radius! T-They’ll be outnumbered if this keeps 
up!”</b></p><p><i>Our forces should not have encountered the enemy this soon. They were 
still a distance away from where the sensors were picking up their signatures. However...it 
appears that the enemy are materializing out of thin air.</i></p><p><i>...Wait a 
moment.</i></p><p>“Ami, please perform a spiritual scan on the 
field!”</p><p>“…”</p><p><b>“</b><b>Scan is complete. It has been confirmed. Spiritual 
ratings far exceed that of normal dimension perimeters and they are still 
rising!”</b></p><p>“!” <i>That place is---</i> “Jupiter, Venus and Neptune units, move out! 
Earth, remain where you are and continue on standby for backup support!”</p><p>“Setsuna, 
where are you going?” Taya inquired the woman.</p><p>“To the battlefield.”</p><p>“But you 
are a tactician! It is far too dangerous for you to go out there!”</p><p>“I can assure you 
that I am not defenceless,” she reassured her. “There is something that I must do. Please 
take over in my absence. I have faith in your abilities.”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p><i>If my 
hypothesis is correct, then it will not matter how many of the enemy numbers we defeat. They 
will continue to multiply endlessly because he turned this ground…</i></p><p>…<i>into a 
spiritual graveyard!</i></p><p><u>(Mercury shuttle)</u></p><p>Ami pushed herself up from her 
desk. She already knew how the situation was turning out but out of morbid curiosity she 
glanced at the overhead projector again. The numbers were indicating the worst.</p><p>“The 
enemy keeps multiplying, while our own forces are… No, the only way for our plan to succeed 
now is to force our way into the city in one massive attack. We must break through their 
line!”</p><p>“Your Highness, please wait!”</p><p>“Don’t try to stop me.” <i>Makoto is out 
there fighting right now.</i></p><p>“I-It’s not that!” The technician shuddered. “Our 
machinery seems to have lost Lady Hotaru’s signal!”</p><p>“What? She’s 
missing?”</p><p>“Please forgive us! We don’t know how it happened, but suddenly she just 
disappeared from detection! The radar cannot sense her presence 
anywhere!”</p><p><b>KABOoOoOoOoM!</b></p><p>The entire ground beneath the shuttle shook with 
a tremendous force as a blast sounded in the air. Everyone was sent off balance and was 
forced to grip onto any solid, stable object for support.</p><p>“W-What was that?!” One of 
the crew members exclaimed.</p><p>Ami looked to the overhead map and noticed that a massive 
hole had appeared in the enemy’s forces. There was another startling explosion before 
another chunk of the red mass was eliminated.</p><p><i>I think…I’ve just found her…</i> Her 
expression was stern. <i>But what is she doing down there? Earth’s forces, the current 
representative body for both the Earth and the Moon, was instructed to stay and guard our 
back flank.</i></p><p>That was when it dawned on the woman.</p><p><i>Wait! She’s isn’t going 
to… Oh no! I need to get down there right away!</i></p><p>“Take over while I’m gone!” She 
shouted over her shoulder as she dashed out of the bridge.</p><p>“But—Your 
Highness!”</p><p><u>(Earth Shuttle, Nozomi)</u></p><p><b>RUMbLe…</b></p><p>“W-Woah!” The 
girl clung tightly onto the hallway railing for support. “D-Damn it! What in Mars are they 
doing out there?!”</p><p><i>Grr… This is just ridiculous! Of all the things to happen when 
you need to go to the bathroom! </i></p><p>Nozomi continued to grumble to herself as she 
waited for the explosions to die down in intensity. The girl had started on a self-rant 
about Hotaru’s miraculous transformation when a pool of black particles began to form in the 
dim corridor behind her.</p><p><i>--I mean what kind of growth spurt did she hit?! She’s 
taller than me now! Not to mention she’s miraculously older looking and speaks all 
intelligently n’ all, and… I wonder if she’s out there fighting right now... She seemed like 
she was in a huge rush to go somewhere.</i></p><p>“Lucky bum,” The girl sighed. She was a 
short distance away from Usagi’s room now.</p><p><i>I know Sir Rei meant well but what’s the 
point in guarding someone who’s already being protected by the entire army? It’s not like 
the enemy will ever make it back here.</i></p><p><b>…</b><b>Artemis…</b></p><p>“Hm?” <i>Did… 
someone just say something?</i> “Hey. Is somebody there?”</p><p>“<i>I don’t suppose you’ve 
heard stories of the Sun Kingdom, Nozomi?”</i></p><p>The girl peered into the back hall 
behind her but it was too dimly lit to see anything.</p><p>“Look, what is your problem? Stop 
hiding around that corner and come out! It’s not like I’m going to hurt you.” She took a 
step towards the dark area. <i>Is it that King guy again?</i> “If it’s Endymion or whatever 
your name is I already told you! Usagi can’t see anyone right now. I’m supposed to be 
guar—”</p><p><b>Swip--!</b></p><p>“Aah!!”</p><p>A black substance had shot out of the 
shadows and wrapped tightly around her forearm.</p><p>“W-What?! What is this thing?!” She 
began to panic.</p><p>“<i>As the stories go, they say Apollo used an army of children, armed 
with the knowledge of aura suppression, to spy upon the other Gods and Goddesses in his 
court for him.”</i></p><p>“Rrg!!! LET GO OF ME!!!” She snapped out of shock and began to 
struggle against the sludge-like substance. She threw a series of punches, karate chops, and 
even delivered a direct roundhouse kick to it, but all of her attacks were absorbed like it 
was rubber. All the while, the girl thought her heart was going to burst from panic; there 
was a cold chill spreading up her arm and throughout her entire body from the point of 
contact. Fear and exhaustion spread with it like a virus.</p><p><i>D-Damn… Why… am I 
get--ting… so tired…?</i></p><p>Nozomi clumsily stumbled onto the tips of her toes in a last 
ditch attempt to stay upright, but her balanced failed her; all it took was one strong tug 
to drag the girl down face first onto the floor.</p><p><b>Thud!</b></p><p>Nozomi felt 
paralyzed. There were voices whispering inside of her head and the world was spinning as she 
sensed that something was inching towards her. Despite the nausea she attempted to look up 
for some clue as to what was going on, but she found that couldn’t move her head; the colour 
in her eyes dulled and they became hollow when another pair of bright eyes found hers. In 
that instant all sense of consciousness began to fade.</p><p><i>...Sir Rei!</i></p><p><u> 
(Earth Shuttle, Usagi’s room)</u></p><p>Usagi remained dutifully in her room as her sister 
had requested. However, as soon as the tremors had started she knew their source; the woman 
could already picture her sister in the midst of battle, wielding her silence glaive as she 
gracefully decimated their enemy’s numbers with unrivalled skill and 
power.</p><p><i>Hotaru...</i></p><p>The rumbling continued to decrease in intensity. 
Distance; she was painfully aware of the distance that separated them.</p><p>“<i>I’ll be 
honest with you. You don’t belong in the battlefield.”</i></p><p>Usagi 
trembled.</p><p>“<i>It would also be...disrespectful to our mother’s sacrifice. She died so 
that you could live.” </i></p><p>She shut her eyes tight.</p><p>“<i>The people of Earth have 
placed their trust in you. If you perish in battle then who will be left to re-build the 
Kingdom?”</i></p><p><i>You’re out there fighting this instant, aren’t you? </i>She walked 
over to the window and peered out of it. In the distance she could make out swirling clouds 
and hear the distant clashing of blades. From where she stood, the battle didn’t appear to 
be as grim as her sister had described it to be.</p><p><i>Lately...I can’t help but feel 
that you’ve been acting strange. When we met with the people of Earth and they attacked us, 
why didn’t you try to fight back? I asked you many times why you didn’t, and each and every 
time you’ve avoided the subject. You accuse me of faking a smile, but you also do the 
same...</i></p><p>“You were adamant about fighting in this war the very moment Setsuna had 
mentioned it. But, this isn’t just about protecting me, is it?”</p><p><i>Sir Ares had asked 
Apollo where you were. While you were missing from home, were you with him? But...our Uncle 
betrayed our mother. Does that also mean that he betrayed your trust as well? 
</i></p><p><i>Do you hate them that much? </i></p><p>She thought back to their pinky swear 
promise. Now that she thought about it, Hotaru had said something very strange during their 
conversation.</p><p>“<i>If you go into battle, and </i><i><u>somehow we both 
die</u></i><i>...then who will be left to lead?” </i></p><p>Usagi’s mouth opened in a 
wordless gasp. It couldn’t be.</p><p><i>No...</i> <i>Don’t tell me you plan on sacrificing 
yourself!</i></p><p><u>(Battlefield)</u></p><p><b>“</b><b>bzzt—The dimension over the city 
is warping! Spiritual levels are still rising!”</b></p><p><u>(Earth Shuttle, 
Usagi)</u></p><p>“No! I’ve-- I’ve got to stop her!” In haste she stepped towards the door, 
but was surprised when it abruptly opened by itself. A familiar figured stepped inside and 
the door slid shut behind her.</p><p>“Oh! Nozomi… You frightened me for a moment there. I 
assume you found the restrooms without a problem?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The girl remained 
motionless. Her chin was tilted downwards so that her bangs hung over her eyes. Usagi 
unconsciously shivered at the sight of the child. She never found people of other planets 
repulsive or foreign in any disgusting, alien type of way, but the young Martian’s aura was 
something else entirely. Unstable—the word came to mind.</p><p><i>Where did this chilling 
atmosphere come from?</i></p><p>Any second now she expected the young girl to tilt her head 
to the side and beam up at her with a big grin like she always would. Then she would go into 
a rant about how great ‘Sir Rei’ was and how the Moon ruler should just be ‘a good girl’ and 
stay put while she’s assigned to guard duty, thus putting the blonde’s unfounded fears to 
rest.</p><p>Usagi had hoped.</p><p>“Nozomi…? Is something wrong? You’re being awfully 
quiet.”</p><p><b>“…</b><b>Artemis…”</b></p><p><i>Artemis?!</i></p><p>A fierce wind suddenly 
tore throughout the room and Usagi was forced to step back with her arms up to shield 
herself from the icy entity.</p><p>“N-Nozomi?!” To her horror, Usagi watched the young 
Martian’s head slowly come up and made eye contact with her.</p><p><i>She has crimson 
eyes.</i></p><p>Nozomi broke out into a maniacal laughter as darkness erupted within the 
room and swallowed 
everything.</p><p><i>Hotaru!</i></p><p>“<i>AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!</i>”</p><p><u>(Battlefield)</u></p><p><b>Ting! 
Ting! SLASH!</b></p><p><i>They just keep on coming! There’s no end to them in sight!</i> 
Haruka grunted as she cut through five shadow assassins.</p><p>Meanwhile, a few meters away, 
Rei was having the exact sentiments.</p><p><i>If we cut one down, three more take its place! 
It’s just like on Venus, but worse!</i></p><p>“HaH!</p><p><b>SLASH!</b></p><p>“Stay down!” 
She roared as more tauntingly materialized before her eyes. The newly re-formed group of the 
enemy charged forward to challenge the enraged soldier, only to disintegrate when an 
aquamarine light broke through the 
mist.</p><p><b>Sheeeeen…</b></p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p><p><b>Whiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiIIIIRRRRRRRRRR</b></i><b>----KABLAM!!!</b></p><p>“KREEEEEE?!?! 
”</p><p><b>Shroom!</b></p><p>“Push forward!” Michiru shouted to them. Ami and Makoto had 
also joined the fight behind her.</p><p>“What?!” Haruka shot back. “But isn’t that 
suicide?!”</p><p><i>Can you not sense her? She is already gathering 
power--!</i></p><p>“Hotaru has left her post with Earth’s forces and is taking matters into 
her own hands! If we don’t hurry she’ll lock us out! Look!”</p><p>“Lock us out?” Uranus 
whipped her head towards the Capital City and instantly she felt a huge spiritual pressure 
pull down on her body. <i>What?! </i>Haruka gritted her teeth and felt her eyes go wide. 
Along the perimeter of the city there was purple lightning crackling in the air.</p><p><i>I 
see it! Her barrier is still incomplete. Hotaru must be trying to initiate it from a 
distance! But if she were to make it to the city, then it will be impossible for us to get 
in!</i></p><p>“HAH!!” Haruka then lunged forward and struck down another group of enemies. 
<i>No matter what, I can’t let that happen!</i> “Everyone! Ignore the foot soldiers and head 
for the city!”</p><p>“But what about Setsuna?!” Ami shouted.</p><p>“Knowing her, she’s 
probably already on her way here. But whether she catches up to us or not is up to her. 
We’ll fight without her if necessary!”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>“Setsuna? But what about 
the others?!” Minako protested behind her. “We can’t just leave them here! Look around you! 
Can’t you see what’s happening?!”</p><p>Fear grew in the blonde’s eyes as the hoarse screams 
of the fallen tore across the field. They were still falling in droves all around them. No 
matter where they looked, it was impossible to block out the carnage and destruction from 
their minds.</p><p>“So many have already died! Can you really tell us to abandon them when 
they need us the most?!”</p><p>Minako’s blood ran cold when Haruka whirled on her with a 
stern expression.</p><p>“Don’t make me repeat myself. I said leave 
them!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“Our primary objective was to infiltrate the City of the Gods! 
You already knew that we would have to leave them at some point, and that time is 
now!”</p><p><i>You are still too inexperienced to understand the 
priorities…</i></p><p>“Don’t become hung up over what is in front of you! Open your eyes! We 
can fight here forever and still do nothing for them!”</p><p>To their side, Rei guarded 
herself and counterattacked with a fiery strike. Another three shadow assassins perished. 
They were replaced by five more, forcing the raven-haired woman to leap back from harm’s 
way. The two Martian soldiers nearby were not as lucky; they were instantly swallowed up by 
the multiplying masses.</p><p><i>Damn it!!</i> Rei cursed in frustration.</p><p>By now the 
determination in Haruka’s eyes were casting doubt over Minako’s wavering blue.</p><p>“Our 
real opponent is inside! This is why we’ve been training so hard together! Because it will 
take every one of us to defeat him! If we stay and fight out here, we’ll eventually tire out 
and die, just like them!” She pointed to the piles of corpses nearby. Behind her, Michiru, 
Ami and Makoto concentrated on clearing a path through the enemy 
numbers.</p><p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p><p>“Sparking…Wide Pressure!”</p><p>“Shine…Aqua 
Illusion!”</p><p><b>BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!</b></p><p>“But there is a chance if we defeat Apollo. 
If we stop him then the war will instantly end. Just like Setsuna said! We can save millions 
by sacrificing the lives of a few!”</p><p><i>What is crueller in the long run? What method 
will save the most? Is my command unreasonable? Do you… think that I want to sacrifice any 
at all?</i></p><p>“Tell me Venus Minako… between staying here and waiting for death… or 
ordering the leave for a chance… WHAT WOULD YOU DO?!” Haruka roared.</p><p>Minako stumbled 
back and swallowed hard. It felt like a lump had grown in there since the last time she 
spoke. She knew that Haruka was right, but it wasn’t fair.</p><p><i>I’ve only met my people 
and was truly accepted for who I am… and now, to save them, I have to abandon them? But, who 
will die in my absence? They are all precious to me!</i></p><p><b>SLASH!</b></p><p>The hairs 
on the back of the Venusian’s neck rose when a cool wind brushed up against her. Venus’s 
elite guard broke past the line and aided the Goddesses in their goal to farther 
ahead.</p><p>“Clear a path for them! Do whatever it takes!” A male’s voice gave the command. 
Then, in a softer, reassuring tone he advised his ruler, “There’s no need to worry about us! 
Rest assured... we will be able to handle this!”</p><p>“Render?!”</p><p>The young man was 
panting for breath, but he still wore a confident smile on his face. He was no longer garbed 
in his regular soldier’s uniform, but wore the special elite guard armor; its golden pieces 
and Venus’s insignia gleamed proudly upon its new master.</p><p>“It is not only our duty, 
but our wish to serve you! Please go on ahead! Even if we were to fall here, today, keep in 
mind that we came here willingly. Keep no regrets in your heart, no matter what the 
outcome!”</p><p>White lightning struck in the distance ahead, wiping out the wall of enemies 
that adamantly blocked their route.</p><p><b>KABLAM!</b></p><p><i>That power!</i> Minako and 
the other’s hearts skipped a beat.</p><p>“It’s Artemis!”</p><p>The man materialized his 
spear and smiled pleasantly despite being surrounded by the enemy. However the deceiving 
gesture bared its destructive fangs with a single swing of his arm! They were no 
longer!</p><p><b>Swish-----</b></p><p>“KREeEeEeE!!!!”</p><p><b>Shroom!</b></p><p>“Like the 
young man has said, there is no need to worry! I will also remain here and command our 
forces in your stead!” With that Artemis unleashed another thunderous bolt of energy and 
split a clear path for his comrades.</p><p>“There is it!” Haruka cried out. But her relief 
shrivelled away when purple lightning to the East Side of the City tore another path through 
the enemy lines.</p><p><i>It’s Hotaru!</i> The wind ruler briefly glimpsed the dark-haired 
woman before she disappeared behind the black bodies.</p><p><i>We don’t have any time to 
lose!</i> Uranus sprinted down the path Artemis had cleared for them only seconds before 
with Michiru, Ami, and Jupiter following closely behind her.</p><p>“Mina!” Rei approached 
the hesitant blonde and saw her look back uncertainly. She could see the answer in her blue 
eyes. It was obvious that Haruka had gotten through to her, but the inner conflicting 
arguments still loosely lingered there.</p><p>The Martian gritted her teeth and she seized 
the other woman’s hand!</p><p>“Come on, don’t just stand there!”</p><p>It was a race against 
Hotaru now! Both groups hurriedly cut through the enemy ranks, eager to reach the City of 
the Gods, while unconsciously denying the other’s party’s sense of mercy and honour. They 
had all fought and trained as a group, as a team that had persevered through all the 
struggles for this one chance. Why should that change now? Why should one person be allowed 
to suffer and fight alone?</p><p>Both Hotaru and the other Goddesses broke through the enemy 
lines and sprinted across the last stretch to the city limits. It all came down to timing 
and they were both unbelievably close. Whether it was desperation or the strength of their 
wills, all it took was one step; one step over the invisible line and Hotaru’s spell sprung 
to life and encased the entire city within one massive, dome 
barrier.</p><p>“Oof!”</p><p><b>WhoooOOOOOOOOOSH!</b></p><p><u>(Hotaru, Eastside City of 
Gods)</u></p><p>Hotaru’s balance wavered as she felt the massive pull on her powers. The 
spell had drained her terribly, but she assured herself that the effort would be rewarded in 
the long run.</p><p>With a curious gaze, she peered at her creation up and down; it 
stretched over the city, looming over her once to-be home as a new night that had descended 
with the promise of destruction. At the same time, however, it was not a mere messenger of 
doom but a shield. Whatever should happen within its spelled walls should stay 
inside.</p><p>It was supposed to be perfect. Her carefully thought out plan was nearly 
flawless in every aspect except for one, and she had just discovered 
it.</p><p>“<i>Hotaru!”</i></p><p>“Usagi?!” Hotaru whipped her head around in question to the 
empty space. The call to her heart had been strong and recent. There was no doubt about it; 
his stench in this deed was undeniable.</p><p><i>Apollo!</i></p><p>Hotaru bit down hard on 
her bottom lip and curled her fingers into shaking fists. Her aura crackled by her sides 
like ravenous serpents ready to devour the fallen King of Gods.</p><p>“I won’t forgive 
you!”</p><p><u>(Rei, Southside of City of Gods)</u></p><p><b>shf…shf…</b></p><p>Rei groaned 
as she pushed herself up onto her knees. For a brief second, it slipped the Martian’s mind 
of where she was. But upon quickly scanning the foreign surroundings around her, she 
proposed that she had been sent flying into a new world.</p><p><i>Ugh...What is this 
place?</i></p><p>She blinked as she mysteriously felt her spirit being beckoned by the 
mysterious structures. There were tall, golden buildings that towered over them, guarding 
the motionless history that remained engrained within their dusty walls. Similarly, the 
sandy streets below, where they stood, were vacant of all life for possibly centuries now. 
Only old footsteps of the fallen remained preserved within the ancient grains.</p><p>Rei 
gathered some courage and walked forwards to where she bent down to observe such a mark. The 
wind scraped across it and shifted the grains of sand a bit, but it could not entirely 
extinguish its existence. Out of morbid curiosity, she touched it. Instantly, a peculiar 
sensation flooded into her. In her mind’s eye she could see the backside of a man. He was a 
golden haired individual and was staring up at the sky in sad thought.</p><p>“…<i>Why is it 
so wrong to want to be with her…?”</i></p><p>He began walking forward into the 
city.</p><p>“--ei...Rei! Hey Rei, are you all right?!” Someone shook her shoulders. The 
Martian snapped out of it and jumped up to her feet to find the others observing her with 
curious expressions.</p><p>“You were spaced out.” Haruka offered.</p><p>“Huh? I was?” 
<i>But, just now...What did I just see? Who was that person?</i></p><p>“Yeah, but then 
again, I guess I can’t blame you. This place is pretty amazing, isn’t it? I’m still kinda 
surprised that we all managed to get through before the barrier came up.”</p><p><i>It was a 
close call. I wonder if Setsuna made it as well…</i></p><p>“Hey, where do you think you’re 
going?”</p><p>“Well, we can’t stand and wait around just because we made it this far. Things 
are going to get harder for us from here on.” Rei advised her friends as she walked past 
them. “We should get moving and try to catch up with Hotaru before she does something she’ll 
regret… because of her, we’re already down one person. Without Setsuna, it’s two. We can’t 
afford to lose Hotaru as well.”</p><p>It was true. Now that they’ve been isolated from the 
outside world, it was impossible to escape. They needed all the strength they could 
get.</p><p>Some of them hesitantly peered back at the chaotic battlefield raging on at a 
distance away. Their dearest friends and comrades were all struggling for survival amongst 
the thunderous lightning and roaring wind over there.</p><p><b>“</b><b>Bzz—crack… Uranus 
Commander Kali Auranos is withdrawing from battle. Condition is 
unknown.”</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Neptune medical units 20 to 22 are to intercept and provide 
medical aid!”</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Ksss…kss… A quarter of Venus’s elite guard has been 
annihilated!”</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Temporary withdraw unit!”</b></p><p><b>“… </b><b>Unit 
refuses to retreat!”</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Then send in Earth’s units four to ten! The rest 
shall guard our back flank!”</b></p><p><b>“…</b><b>Orders</b><b> have been received and are 
moving out under the direct leadership of King Endymion!”</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>What? That 
isn’t what I specified!”</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Communications to Earth’s units four to ten 
have been cut off.”</b></p><p>“…”</p><p>“<i>We can save millions by sacrificing the lives of 
a few!”</i></p><p>“<i>WHAT WOULD YOU DO?!” </i></p><p>The group reluctantly turned their 
backs to the pain they left behind. It still existed, and they acknowledged that, but they 
would no longer allow its influence to stray them from their paths.</p><p><i>We must go 
forward, even if it leads to our destruction.</i></p><p>…<i>But we are never alone. For 
those who are precious to us, and for the future…</i></p><p>…<i>Together… we will step 
forward and fight for this one chance!</i></p>
