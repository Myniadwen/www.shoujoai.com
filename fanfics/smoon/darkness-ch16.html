<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>&quot;Well it seems that Serena here has made a name for herself.&quot;, said 
Amara as she ran a hand through her short bangs.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;,asked Serena.

&quot;What she means.&quot;, said Michelle. &quot;Is that word got out that you 
killed two slayers. All the vampires now you.

&quot;So that&#39;s a good thing.&quot;, replied Serena with a smile. Amara and 
Michelle shook their heads &#39;no&#39;.

&quot;No it&#39;s not.&quot;, said Michelle. Serena&#39;s face scrunched up in 
confusion.

&quot;Why not?&quot;, she asked.

&quot;Because it&#39;s going around through the slayers that a mere child 
killed two slayers. Their leader isn&#39;t pleased and they&#39;re looking for 
you.&quot; said Amara.

&quot;Who&#39;s their leader?&quot;, asked Rei.

&quot;Darien Chiba.&quot;

&#39;Darien Chiba?&#39; thought Serena, contemplating the name in her head.

&quot;So this Darien guy is the leader?&quot; asked Serena. She watched as the 
three women nodded their heads.

&quot;Then he must die.&quot; replied Serena.

&quot;Say what?&quot; exclaimed the three women in shock.

&quot;I said Darien must die.&quot; repeated Serena. Amara, Michelle and Setsuna 
looked at each other before they burst in a fit of laughter. Serena 
frowned, not finding anything funny about this.

&quot;What is so funny?&quot; growled Serena. Michelle calmed her laughter and 
wiped the tears from her eyes.

&quot;You think that you.&quot; said Michelle as she pointed a finger at Serena. 
&quot;Can beat Darien?&quot;

&quot;Yes I believe that I can beat Darien.&quot; said Serena with confidence.

&quot;Child please. Darien we kill you in a heartbeat.&quot; said Setsuna as she 
stopped laughing and put up a smile.

&quot;I so can kill Darien.&quot; exclaimed Serena. &quot; I mean, he killed my 
parents and I told you I will avenge their deaths no matter what. I 
will keep my word.&quot;

&quot;I know you want to avenge your parents&#39; deaths and all, but Darien is 
way to strong for you kid. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I would love to beat 
the crap out of him myself, but I now my limits.&quot; said Amara. Serena 
stood up from her seat angered.

&quot;I don&#39;t care how strong he is. I will kill him if it&#39;s the last thing 
I do.&quot; exclaimed Serena as she left the kitchen. Rei got up from her 
seat and chased after her girlfriend.

Michelle sighed quietly to herself. &quot; That went well.&quot;

Amara slouched down in her seat and drummed her fingers on the table. 
&quot;I have to make a phone call to Artemis.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; questioned Setsuna.

&quot;We can&#39;t stay here, we&#39;ll be easily found. I&#39;ll ask Artemis if we can 
stay there for the time being. Plus Serena would be happy to see her 
brothers again.&quot; said Amara.

&quot;Alright, Setsuna and I will get the kids ready.&quot; said Michelle as she 
sat up from her seat with Setsuna. Amara nodded her head as she left 
the kitchen and went to use the phone.

Michelle left the kitchen followed by Setsuna to get the kids packed 
up. They both split up in different directions and continued down the 
hallway.

Michelle went to Hotaru and Rini&#39;s room first. She lightly knocked on 
the door and walked inside. She was surprised to see Rini in Hotaru&#39;s 
lap sitting quietly.

Michelle cleared her throat to gain some attention. The two girls 
looked over towards Michelle in squealed in surprise. Rini jumped out 
of Hotaru&#39;s lap blushing as Hotaru began to blush as well. Michelle 
smirked knowingly, which made the girls blush deepened.

&quot;Well well, what do we have here?&quot; questioned Michelle. Hotaru and 
Rini looked at each other before looking back at Michelle.

&quot;Nothing!&quot; they both replied sheepishly. Michelle quirked and eyebrow.

&quot;That surely didn&#39;t look like nothing&quot; said Michelle as she walked 
further into the room.

&quot;Well, we were just....&quot; started Hotaru trying to make up a excuse.

&quot;Your just lucky Amara didn&#39;t walk in here. You would never hear the 
end of it.&quot; said Michelle. Hotaru ad Rini shared confused glances at 
each other.

&quot;So you&#39;re not mad?&quot; asked Rini.

&quot;Of course not. I knew you liked each other.&quot; said Michelle. Hotaru 
and Rini looked at each other again and decided not to ask how she 
knew.

&quot;What did you want us for?&quot; asked Hotaru.

&quot;You guys have to get packed up. We&#39;re leaving.&quot; said Michelle.

&quot;Leaving? Why?&quot; asked Rini.

&quot;Well were just have some difficulties you guys don&#39;t need to know.&quot; 
said Michelle as she brought out some suitcases and thing from the 
closet.

&quot;So you guys must hurry up.&quot; said Michelle as she walked out of the 
room to see Rei and Serena. Michelle knocked on their door before she 
walked inside.

She saw Serena lying face down on the bed with Rei sitting next to 
her. The young raven-haired girl was rubbing Serena&#39;s back and 
whispering things to her.

Rei looked over to Michelle and smiled at her. Michelle returned the 
gesture and walked over to the bed and sat down.

&quot;Come on we have to go.&quot; said Michelle as she placed her hand on 
Serena&#39;s back.

&quot;We are we going?&quot; asked Rei.

&quot;You&#39;ll see, but we must hurry.&quot; said Michelle as she stood up from 
the bed.

&quot;Are we coming back?&quot; asked Serena as she sat up and looked towards 
Michelle.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I can assure you we won&#39;t be coming back anytime 
soon.&quot; said Michelle.

&quot;So come on.&quot; said Michelle as she brought out the suitcases. Serena 
and Rei got off of their bed and advanced towards the suitcases and 
began packing anything they could.

*********************

About 2 hours or more later, everyone had their bags packed and 
settled by the front door.

&quot;Come on and let&#39;s bring everything to the truck.&quot; said Amara as she 
picked up a couple of bags and walked out the front door.

Everyone followed her lead and walked outside with the respective 
belongings. Once everything was packed inside of the black Excursion 
XLT, the group piled up inside of the truck.

Amara and Michelle sat in the two front seats. Next sat Setsuna, Ami, 
Molly and Melvin. In the last row sat Rei, Serena, Hotaru and Rini.

Amara started up the car and began the journey to Luna and Artemis&#39;s 
house. Serena looked over to Hotaru and Rini and noticed them cuddling 
with each other.

Serena lightly nudged Rei in the side who was resting against Serena. 
Rei looked at Serena startled and followed Serena&#39;s gaze. She looked 
at Hotaru and Rini and smiled slightly.

&quot;I guess Setsuna was right.&quot; whispered Rei into Serena&#39;s ear. Serena 
smiled back and leaned further into Rei. She took a quick glance at 
Amara who was glancing at Hotaru and Rini every know and then. She 
held a smirked that showed non-stop torture of teasing towards Hotaru 
and Rini.

Serena turned her attention towards Michelle, who was shaking her head 
towards Amara&#39;s antics.

Serena smiled to herself and closed her eyes to get some rest. The car 
ride was pretty much quit considering the light chatter of Amara, 
Michelle and Setsuna.

Amy slept with her head a against her mother&#39;s lap. Setsuna 
absent-mindedly ran her fingers through Ami&#39;s short blue hair as the 
young girl slept.

Molly leaned against her brother as she slept. Melvin wrapped a 
protective arm around his sister&#39;s shoulders. Melvin stared down at 
his sister watching her sleep.

Hotaru had her arm wrapped around Rini&#39;s waist, keeping each other 
close to one another. Both the girls were asleep. Serena had both her 
arms wrapped around Rei&#39;s waist as she slept peacefully. Rei ran her 
fingers through Serena&#39;s loose soft hair as she looked out the window.

***********

Amara pulled her truck up to what looked like a large truck. She 
rolled down the window and hit a certain part of the rock. The front 
part of the rock began to rise to show a secret entrance.

Amara smiled slightly and drove the car inside. The rock closed behind 
her. Inside waiting for them was Artemis and Luna.</pre>
