<h1>Wasting the Moonlight</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/majean.html">Majean</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Minako walked down the street in that slow, languid way that movement takes on 
when one isn&#39;t paying attention to the world around her. Though the brilliant 
sites and sounds of Tokyo were all about her, the girl&#39;s thoughts were very much 
elsewhere. She sighed and with that sigh came the remnants of so many hopes and 
dreams - the kind often found in a young girl&#39;s heart. Aino Minako; yes, that 
pretty much said it all; Sailor Venus. Minako&#39;s thoughts were drifting on love: 
Makoto and her old sempai; Usagi and Mamoru; even Luna and Artemis. Of course 
her thoughts drifted to Asai-kun, her old friend and fellow volleyball player. 
It was very sweet of Artemis to bring her those flowers, he&#39;d knows just what 
she&#39;d needed then. It had even cheered her up for quite a time, but all things 
fade and this was no exception. Now Minako walked Tokyo, lonely and searching. 

&quot;Hey, little kitten, isn&#39;t it a little late for you to be wandering alone?&quot;

Minako turned, startled, to find whom had spoken. An incredibly handsome young 
man leaned against his bike at the curb near her. She took a step closer, 
realizing that no, it wasn&#39;t a handsome young man, but a handsome young woman - 
Tenoh Haruka to be specific.

&quot;Ha... Haruka-san!&quot; gasped Minako. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Haruka smiled her sexy half-smile and stood. &quot;It isn&#39;t good for little kittens 
to be out at this time of night.&quot; Minako blushed as the other girl stepped close 
to her. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t like some company, would you?&quot;

Minako looked down, flustered. Haruka was a girl, it was okay, Haruka was a 
girl, she kept telling herself.

&quot;Say,&quot; said Haruka, as if suddenly struck by an idea. &quot;How about I take you for 
a ride on my bike? It&#39;s a shame to waste the moonlight.&quot; She bent down and 
smiled in the other girl&#39;s face. &quot;Isn&#39;t it?&quot; She handed her a spare helmet and 
Minako accepted. &quot;Hold on tight,&quot; cautioned Haruka as she started the engine.

Minako gasped as they sped off, hugging her companion tight. The lights of the 
city flashed by them in bright streaks. It wasn&#39;t too long before she was 
smiling and resting her head (as best she could) against Haruka&#39;s back. She even 
closed her eyes, lulled by movement of the bike and the oh-so-comforting 
presence of its rider.

&quot;Where are we?&quot; Minako asked, a tad sleepily, as Haruka stopped the bike and 
gently helped her off.

&quot;That&#39;s a secret,&quot; the other replied.

Minako looked around her. They were along the shore in what appeared to be a 
small Japanese garden. &quot;This is so pretty!&quot; she exclaimed. 

Haruka strolled over to the drop-off, looked down into the water, then sat down 
in the grass, reclining back on her elbows. Minako joined her, kneeling, and 
stared up at the moon. She soon began to fidget and said a little too loudly, 
&quot;Uh, isn&#39;t the moon lovely tonight?&quot; Immediately embarrassed, she looked down, 
face red.

&quot;Not half as pretty as a young girl blushing,&quot; Haruka softly replied. Minako&#39;s 
blush darkened to a deep crimson as Haruka took her hand. &quot;So many people waste 
the moonlight, too.&quot;

Minako stammered a little, unable to form any thoughts. Music and laughter 
spilled out from a little place across the street.

&quot;Do you like to dance?&quot; asked Haruka, standing. Minako looked up and met her 
eyes. &quot;Would you like to dance?&quot;

The younger girl couldn&#39;t stop herself from rising and taking Haruka&#39;s extended 
hand. It was as if she were under a spell - a spell of the moonlight. The two of 
them danced together by the water in the midst of that beautiful garden.

Resting her head against her partner&#39;s shoulder, Minako sighed. Even if Haruka 
was a woman, even if it wasn&#39;t quite the same... It still felt wonderful to be 
held, and the holder was really very sweet. It was almost... everything she&#39;d 
been looking for... Her words to Usagi in the restaurant when first they&#39;d 
glimpsed that handsome young &quot;man&quot; came back to her. Slowly, the pair stopped 
dancing.

&quot;Are you thirsty?&quot; asked Haruka. &quot;Shall we get something to drink?&quot;

Minako nodded and the two of them remounted the bike and rode off. The younger 
girl thought she recognized the area they were speeding through then, but the 
scenery went by too fast for her to get a good look. They stopped at a small 
cafe, mostly empty with a pleasant atmosphere. Haruka guided her to a booth by 
the window and the two sat opposite each other. A waiter came by and Haruka 
ordered some tea, Minako, a cola. The girls sipped their drinks in silence. 

Minako broke the calm with a stumbling question: &quot;So, uh, what were you doing 
out tonight?&quot;

&quot;Pleasure ride,&quot; Haruka replied. &quot;But it&#39;s more pleasurable with someone along. 
How about you?&quot;

&quot;I... was just thinking...&quot; She looked down and played with her glass.

&quot;Oh? About love?&quot; Minako choked and Haruka chuckled softly. &quot;It&#39;s what all girls 
think of,&quot; she said.

&quot;Even you?&quot; inquired Minako.

Haruka set down her teacup and gazed out the window. &quot;Sometimes...&quot; She looked 
back, a half smile playing upon her face. &quot;There&#39;s plenty of time to find the 
right person. In high school, there&#39;s no doubt you&#39;ll have your pick of guys.&quot; 
Here, Haruka gave a full smile and chuckled. &quot;You&#39;re so cute.&quot;

Minako blushed, but smiled and nodded once.

The two girls finished their drinks in silence and Haruka offered to give Minako 
a ride home. As they sped off down the street, the latter dreamed happily about 
love. When they reached their destination and Minako was climbing off, Haruka 
reached for her hand and held it softly. &quot;You&#39;re so cute,&quot; she said and gave 
Minako a light kiss at the corner of her mouth. &quot;Later,&quot; Haruka nodded and rode 
off. 

Minako stood there in the glow of the street lamp, blushing profusely, thinking, 
&quot;I hope I find a guy as sweet as that one someday...&quot;
