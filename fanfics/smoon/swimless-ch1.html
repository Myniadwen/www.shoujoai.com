Haruka=Amara	
Michiru=Michelle		
Setsuna=Trista	
Mamoru=Darien

Finally, Haruka and Michiru are NOT cousins.

------------------------------------------------------------

Michiru glided along the length of the indoor pool, her eyes closed 
and  her consciousness in another world. She felt the sensual pleasure 
of the water  pass over her skin. She was aware of the cooling effect 
it had on her body.  She enjoyed the way the water made her green 
backless one piece cling to her  slim body.&nbsp;

And she sensed the slowly expanding hunger she felt between her legs.  
Being in the water frequently did that for her.&nbsp;

A gentle circle of her arms pulled her under. There, the water 
surrounded  her like a huge comforting womb. Thinking of it in those 
terms made her groin  tighten even more.

&quot;How Freudian,&quot; she thought. &quot;A sub-conscious desire to return to the  
womb?&quot;

Michiru languidly glided to the bottom of the pool and slid her hand  
against it, then slowly kicked to the surface. If only she could stay 
submerged  forever, where there were no such things as The Silence and 
Messiahs and  invaders from space. If only she could live in the water 
forever. If it  weren&#39;t for Haruka . . .

Her face broke the surface of the water and saw Haruka standing by the  
edge of the pool, smiling at her. The lanky blonde was dressed, as 
usual, in  jeans and a muscle shirt. The black smudge on her cheek 
told Michiru that the  woman had been with her other lover - - her 
car.

&quot;You always look so happy when you&#39;re swimming,&quot; Haruka said, her 
husky  voice making Michiru&#39;s loins rumble all the more.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you come in,&quot; Michiru proposed, &quot;and find out what the  
attraction is.&quot;

&quot;No suit, remember,&quot; Haruka replied.

&quot;That&#39;s OK,&quot; Michiru leered. &quot;There&#39;s no one here but us and I won&#39;t 
be  shocked seeing you naked.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but you won&#39;t be able to keep your hands off me,&quot; joked Haruka.

&quot;And that&#39;s a bad thing how?&quot; Michiru asked, looking at her curiously.

&quot;Pass,&quot; Haruka said, turning to leave.

&quot;Sissy,&quot; Michiru teased and splashed her.

&quot;Hey! Watch the water!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not going to melt.&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re going to get psycho, I&#39;m leaving.&quot;

&quot;Haruka!&quot; Michiru sighed in frustration. &quot;I&#39;m trying to seduce you!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve heard about how you mermaids lure us unsuspecting mortals to 
watery  deaths.&quot;

&quot;I promise I won&#39;t kill you,&quot; she smiled sweetly. &quot;Although I may make  
you groan a little.&quot;

&quot;Uh uh.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just scared,&quot; Michiru smirked.

&quot;I am not!&quot; Haruka growled. Michiru looked at her funny, sensing her 
lover&#39;s mood.

&quot;You never want to go swimming with me. Are you scared of the water?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; she muttered, avoiding her gaze. &quot;It&#39;s just water.&quot;

&quot;Well then what is it?&quot;

&quot;Nothing! I&#39;m . . . just not into swimming.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s very relaxing. And with all the stress we have at Mugen High, we  
need to grab every chance we can to relax.&quot;

&quot;Swimming is exercise,&quot; countered Haruka. &quot;Driving is relaxing.&quot;

&quot;Oh, poo! Come on in - - for me?&quot;

Haruka turned away from her. This surprised Michiru.

&quot;There is something you&#39;re hiding,&quot; she said. &quot;What is it?&quot; Haruka  
didn&#39;t respond, so Michiru climbed out of the pool. She padded over to 
her  lover and grasped her shoulders gently. She felt Haruka tense up 
at her touch.  &quot;Haruka, I love you. I&#39;m not like the others. There&#39;s 
nothing about you  that&#39;ll make me turn away from you - - or on you.&quot;

Haruka exhaled loudly.

&quot;Haruka? You can trust me.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t swim,&quot; Haruka whispered, pulling the words from her mouth 
like a  throbbing tooth.

Michiru stared, stunned.

&quot;I never learned. They wouldn&#39;t let me dress in a guy&#39;s swimsuit when 
I  was younger and I was never . . . well, comfortable wearing a 
girl&#39;s suit. So I  never learned.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; marveled Michiru. &quot;That&#39;s what you&#39;re so ashamed of?&quot;

&quot;Sure, easy for you to say! Nothing ever bothers you!&quot; Instantly 
Haruka  regretted her tone and forced herself to calm, no mean feat 
for her. &quot;I thought  you&#39;d - - look down on me,&quot; Haruka replied. She 
still refused to face her lover.

&quot;If you thought that,&quot; Michiru said, hugging the woman from behind, 
&quot;then  you must not think much of me. I&#39;ve decided I love you, my 
dear; your bad  points as well as your good. And you have a couple of 
points that are a lot  worse than this.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t understand,&quot; Haruka responded. &quot;I couldn&#39;t admit it - -  
couldn&#39;t risk it. I couldn&#39;t risk driving you away.&quot; She turned around 
in  Michiru&#39;s arms to face her. &quot;You&#39;re so - - important. I have 
nightmares that  someday you&#39;ll wise up and realize what a raw deal 
you have loving me.&quot;

&quot;Shh,&quot; Michiru said, placing her fingers on Haruka&#39;s mouth. &quot;Don&#39;t.  
Don&#39;t you dare talk like that. I&#39;m not here against my will. I&#39;m not 
deluded.  I know what you are and I know a lot of what haunts you. In 
spite of that, I  chose to love you. Don&#39;t you dare tell me I made a 
mistake in judgment.&quot;

She pressed her head to Haruka&#39;s chest. Haruka responded by folding 
her  arms around the woman.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Haruka grinned shyly.

They hugged while the reflection of the overhead lights shimmered on 
the  surface of the water poolside.

&quot;You&#39;re getting me all wet,&quot; Haruka chuckled.

&quot;You&#39;ll dry out,&quot; she told her, her hands massaging Haruka&#39;s lower 
back.  &quot;If you&#39;d like, I can teach you how to swim.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t laugh at me?&quot;

&quot;If I do, you can spank me,&quot; grinned Michiru.

&quot;Do I have to wear a woman&#39;s swimsuit?&quot;

&quot;Wear anything you like,&quot; Michiru said. Then she grinned 
mischievously.  &quot;Or wear nothing at all. I&#39;ll be less likely to notice 
if you&#39;re bad that way.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re teasing me,&quot; Haruka scowled playfully. Her skin was tingling  
because Michiru&#39;s fingertips were running up and down the base of her 
spine.

&quot;Just a little payback,&quot; Michiru smiled.

&quot;When do we do this?&quot; Haruka asked, showing a slight degree of 
eagerness.

&quot;How about tomorrow? No school on a Sunday.&quot;

&quot;Not now?&quot; Haruka asked, delightfully obtuse to Michiru&#39;s body 
language.

&quot;No,&quot; Michiru said, looking up longingly at her lover. &quot;I&#39;d kind of 
like  to do something else right now.&quot;

Haruka arched an eyebrow. Prompted by the skittering fingertips on her  
spine, she leaned in and gathered Michiru&#39;s mouth to hers. Michiru 
sighed  happily as they kissed, then jumped in surprise as she felt 
Haruka&#39;s hand  probing under her wet swimsuit between her legs.

&quot;Something like that?&quot; Haruka asked.

&quot;You naughty girl!&quot; giggled Michiru.

She pressed her mouth to Haruka&#39;s again. As she did, she worked 
Haruka&#39;s  shirt up. She felt Haruka&#39;s hand brush the straps of her 
swimsuit down her  shoulders. Haruka paused only to allow her top to 
pass over her head. The  blonde was bra-less as usual.&nbsp;

Michiru pressed her hand to her lover&#39;s breast. She squeezed slightly,  
the nipple bulging out, then pressed her lips to it. Her tongue 
emerged and  began swirling around the hardening nipple. She heard 
Haruka&#39;s breath shudder  out and it was like a concerto to her.

She felt Haruka&#39;s hands work her swimsuit over her hips. Haruka held 
her  close, resting her chin on her wet green hair. They sank as one 
to the poolside  tile, Michiru relentlessly worrying the nipple and 
aureole in her mouth.  Haruka&#39;s other breast was in her hand and 
Michiru would occasionally brush the  other nipple with her fingers.

&quot;Michiru,&quot; moaned Haruka. &quot;I . . . uhhhhh . . . your mouth . . . 
driving  me . . . uhhh . . .&quot;

Out of the blue, Haruka held her lover by the ribs and leaned in, 
forcing  her onto her back. Michiru squealed in surprise. Pinning her 
down by laying on  her right leg and draping her arm over Michiru&#39;s 
stomach, Haruka pulled her  partner&#39;s legs apart and began lavishing 
attention on her groin.

&quot;Ahh!&quot; Michiru gasped. &quot;I wasn&#39;t done yet!&quot;

&quot;Yes you were,&quot; rumbled Haruka, her tongue lapping at the young 
woman&#39;s  clitoris and vulva.

&quot;Oh! Ohh!&quot; she cried, squirming helplessly on the tile beneath Haruka.

&quot;You taste like chlorine.&quot;

&quot;You monster!&quot; Michiru giggled, her laughter intermixed with moans.

It was coming. Michiru had been keyed up for a while, so her orgasm 
began  building quickly. She felt it begin to bud, the fires stoking. 
She was filled  with anticipation. She needed to feel it wash over 
her.

Then her mind clouded by familiar premonitions. The dark thoughts  
overwhelmed her and the flower wilted.

&quot;H-Haruka,&quot; she murmured, unable to conceal her disappointment.

&quot;I know,&quot; Haruka scowled. &quot;I feel it, too. They&#39;re about to make a 
play  for another heart crystal.&quot; She seemed to hover, reluctant to 
abandon her  passion. But the moment was ashes and there was no 
reclaiming it.

Haruka got up and offered her hand. Michiru took it and pulled herself 
to  her feet. As one, they produced their henshin sticks.

------------------------------------------------------------

The battle with the Eudial lasted the rest of the afternoon and 
resumed  the following day. It was almost twenty-four hours later when 
Haruka and  Michiru were able to return to the vast high-rise they 
shared. Though  Eudial had been defeated, the battle had not exactly 
gone as they had hoped.

&quot;That girl!&quot; fumed Michiru. &quot;Is she just so dense that she doesn&#39;t  
understand?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s an optimist,&quot; Haruka said, massaging Michiru&#39;s shoulders from  
behind. &quot;They think like that.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t afford na&iuml;ve optimism, not at a time like this! If Sailor 
Moon  continues down this path, we may have to do something about her. 
Honestly,  sometimes she&#39;s just as weepy and childish as - - as 
Usagi!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll win. We have to.&quot; Haruka kept massaging her lover&#39;s shoulders. 
&quot;You are so tense. Why don&#39;t you take a dip? That always makes 
everything better for you.&quot;

Michiru smiled at the thought. &quot;Why don&#39;t you take one with me?&quot; 
Michiru  purred, placing her hand on Haruka&#39;s.

&quot;Um . . .&quot;

&quot;I promised to teach you, remember? Don&#39;t chicken out on me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not chickening out,&quot; Haruka snorted. &quot;I, um, just haven&#39;t gotten 
a  suit yet.&quot;

&quot;And I told you that you didn&#39;t need one,&quot; Michiru said seductively,  
turning to Haruka and staring up at her with bedroom eyes. She eased 
the blouse  off the woman&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;But, um,&quot; Haruka stammered, breathing more heavily, &quot;that&#39;s not 
really  going to help me concentrate.&quot; Michiru was undoing the button 
on Haruka&#39;s jeans.

&quot;If it&#39;ll help,&quot; Michiru smiled, easing Haruka&#39;s jeans over her hips 
and  letting them fall, &quot;I won&#39;t wear anything, either.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s that supposed to help?&quot;

Michiru smothered a laugh. &quot;Stop being a baby and come swim with me! I  
don&#39;t say anything when we waste countless hours driving around in 
that old  car!&quot;

Haruka scowled at her. She bobbed up, kissed Haruka on the mouth, then  
stared sweetly, yet insistently.

&quot;OK,&quot; sighed Haruka. &quot;But if you laugh at me, I&#39;m holding you under.&quot;

&quot;Now you&#39;re taking all the fun out of it,&quot; teased Michiru. She hurried  
out of her clothes.

Naked, Haruka eased herself into the shallow end. As long as her feet  
could touch bottom, she could convince herself that it was a giant 
bath. The  water was cool enough to be invigorating without being 
uncomfortable. This was  good. Being naked was uncomfortable enough. 
Growing up with gender identity  issues wasn&#39;t usually conducive to 
having a good body image. She glanced as  Michiru dove in effortlessly 
and glided through the water like a dolphin.  Haruka envied her. The 
woman always seemed at ease with her sexuality, just  like she seemed 
at ease with almost every aspect of her life.

Water sprayed on her back. She turned around just in time to see 
Michiru  bob to the surface and glide over.

&quot;Ready?&quot; Michiru asked, water beads glistening on her cheeks and her 
bare  bosom.

Haruka nodded uncertainly. Michiru boosted herself up by placing her  
hands on Haruka&#39;s shoulders and kissed her.

&quot;I appreciate you doing this for me,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I can see this 
makes  you nervous. Just trust me and don&#39;t be scared. I&#39;ll look out 
for you.&quot;  Haruka nodded. &quot;Now I want you to lay across my hands on 
your stomach,&quot; and she  extended her hands just under the surface of 
the water.

Haruka eyed her skeptically. &quot;You&#39;re stronger than you look.&quot;

&quot;Buoyancy is a powerful ally, my dear,&quot; she replied, wrinkling her 
nose.&nbsp;

Haruka complied, stretching out in the water. She fully expected to 
sink  like a submarine, but Michiru&#39;s hands supported her.&nbsp;

&quot;Now keep your legs straight, point your toes and just move your legs 
up  and down.&quot;

Following instructions, Haruka moved her legs. It was immediately 
obvious  she lacked coordination.

&quot;Coordinate your motions,&quot; advised Michiru. She smiled as inspiration  
struck. &quot;Picture the way the pistons move in your car.&quot;

&quot;Ha ha,&quot; scowled Haruka. However, the advice worked and soon Michiru 
was  hard-pressed to keep her pupil in place.

&quot;OK, now kick faster,&quot; Michiru said. Haruka complied and the 
green-haired  beauty nodded. When her motions got coordinated, Haruka 
would have a powerful  stroke. &quot;Did you know how cute your butt looks 
when you&#39;re kicking?&quot;

&quot;Keep your mind on your work,&quot; Haruka growled playfully.

When she was satisfied with her pupil&#39;s kick, Michiru eased her back 
into  the water, then crossed in front of her.

&quot;Take my hands,&quot; Michiru said, extending hers. &quot;I want you to propel  
yourself with your legs while I lead you.&quot;

&quot;I feel like a little kid,&quot; muttered Haruka.

&quot;Don&#39;t be ashamed of learning,&quot; smiled Michiru. &quot;You&#39;re doing fine.&quot;

They spent the entire afternoon in the pool. When she was satisfied 
with  Haruka&#39;s kick, they practiced her arm stroke. Then she showed 
Haruka how and  when to breathe. Despite all of her misgivings, which 
Haruka took every  opportunity to vocalize, her natural athleticism 
allowed her to adapt quickly to  each new lesson.

Finally, when Michiru was confident enough, she sent Haruka for a lap  
across the width of the pool. The woman&#39;s stroke was very mechanical, 
but she  got across and back without incident.

&quot;I did it!&quot; bellowed Haruka, shooting out of the water as she touched 
the  wall, then sank back in to her chest and touched bottom with her 
feet.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so proud of you!&quot; Michiru beamed. She hugged Haruka tight and  
gave her a passionate kiss. &quot;I told you that you could do it!&quot;

&quot;Teach me another stroke!&quot; gasped Haruka.

&quot;Another day, my love. Let&#39;s master this one, first. Besides, you 
should  be feeling it in your thighs right about now.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; sighed Haruka. Then she leered. &quot;I know what I&#39;d like to 
feel  in my thighs.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s mouth flew open in shock at her lover&#39;s audacity, then 
closed  into a lecherous smile.

&quot;Just hold onto the pool rim,&quot; she said with a devilish gleam in her 
eye.

Michiru bobbed her head under the water and thrust herself down until 
she  was level with Haruka&#39;s groin. Her hands curled around Haruka&#39;s 
hips and  grasped her butt; then Michiru pulled herself in and began 
licking Haruka&#39;s  groin.

Haruka eased her head back on the rim of the pool and let the erotic  
tension spread up through her body. Her buoyancy lent an air or 
unreality to  what she was experiencing. It was like floating in a 
vast tranquil nothingness.  All she had to focus on was her grip on 
the pool rim and the constant tongue  strokes on her most sensitive 
area.

&quot;Uhh!&quot; she grunted as the tip of Michiru&#39;s tongue twittered against 
her  clitoris.

Through the fog of ecstasy covering her brain, Haruka thought suddenly 
of  her partner. How long had she been underwater? There was no way 
she had been  keeping any sort of track of time, but it seemed like a 
while to her. A small  seed of worry began to grow; but for all her 
concern, another voice in her head  greedily shouted them down and 
demanded more of what she was experiencing. At  last Michiru&#39;s head 
bobbed to the surface and took a breath.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Haruka asked, her husky voice even deeper with 
sexual  tension.

&quot;I know what I&#39;m doing,&quot; Michiru smirked. &quot;How&#39;s it feel?&quot;

&quot;Heavenly,&quot; she sighed. &quot;It&#39;s too bad you had to stop.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not finished yet,&quot; Michiru leered. &quot;Get ready to have your toes  
curled.&quot;

She took a deep breath and dived under the water again. Haruka steeled  
herself, but the touch of Michiru&#39;s mouth sent her dying excitement 
level  shooting up again. She gripped the rim of the pool, resisting 
the urge to pull  away and end the torment that felt too good to 
endure.&nbsp;

Air bubbles trickled up from Michiru&#39;s mouth. They danced along 
Haruka&#39;s  pubic mound, tickling already sensitive flesh and brushing 
against the fine  hairs. Haruka felt her insides contract until they 
seemed clenched by a huge  fist. She tried to cry out, but there was 
nothing in her to form words with.  The world was gone. The universe 
had, for her, narrowed down to a patch of skin  between her legs that 
had reached up and grasped her throat, squeezing it shut.&nbsp;

And Michiru continued mercilessly.

So, almost out of self-defense, Haruka climaxed. Like a tidal wave, it  
washed over her, the pent-up tension flooding through her. She felt it 
from the  hairs on her head to the nails on her big toes. Her body 
went limp and slid  under the surface of the water. Only having water 
rush up her nose roused  Haruka. She pushed off the bottom with her 
feet and thrust her head above the  surface. Michiru surfaced amid the 
hacking and coughing of her partner.

&quot;I&#39;m guessing you came,&quot; giggled Michiru. &quot;Want to do it again?&quot;

&quot;Get away from me. You&#39;re dangerous,&quot; joked Haruka, snorting water 
from  her sinuses.

Michiru wrapped her arms around Haruka&#39;s neck and chest from behind.  
&quot;You&#39;ll live. Now tell me true: did you like it?&quot;

&quot;Well you were clearly into it. I&#39;ve rarely seen you that - - 
aggressive?&quot;

&quot;Guilty. There&#39;s something about being submerged that just gets me 
hot.  But you&#39;re avoiding the question. Did you like it?&quot;

Haruka shifted around so they were face to face. Their breasts mashed  
between them as they held each other close.

&quot;Call me old fashioned,&quot; Haruka said. &quot;I still prefer doing it in bed.  
But I&#39;ll admit that you&#39;ve shown me that the water can be fun.&quot;

&quot;And sexy,&quot; Michiru added.

&quot;And sexy.&quot; She glanced wickedly at the ceiling. &quot;I wonder if Usagi  
would be interested in a pool party anytime soon.&quot;

&quot;YOU RAT!&quot; Michiru gasped in mock horror. She jammed her hands on the 
top  of Haruka&#39;s head and pushed the woman under.

Beneath the water, Haruka shifted. She pushed up against Michiru, then  
rose up, throwing the woman over her shoulder. Pulled off her feet, 
Michiru let  out a shriek. Haruka waded to the edge of the pool, but 
was too tired to climb  out burdened with her lover on her shoulder. 
Finally, she set the wriggling  Michiru down.

&quot;You&#39;ve got to lay off the sweets,&quot; panted Haruka.

&quot;Don&#39;t blame me for your lack of conditioning, you beast,&quot; Michiru 
huffed  playfully.

&quot;Lack of conditioning? I&#39;ve only been in this pool all afternoon!&quot; 
With  some effort Haruka hoisted herself out. Crawling up to stand on 
leaden legs,  she lumbered to the bench where towels sat. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m 
going to be so sore  tomorrow - - and my legs will be, too.&quot;

Michiru giggled. &quot;Funny, I&#39;m not a bit tired.&quot;

&quot;Then you can cook tonight.&quot; Haruka bent down slowly and retrieved her  
clothes after drying off. &quot;Seriously, can we practice swimming again - 
- um, in  a few days, when I&#39;ve had a chance to recover?&quot;

&quot;I think I can fit that into my schedule,&quot; Michiru smiled coyly, 
pulling  her clothes on. Haruka watched her wrap her hair in a towel. 
&quot;Oh, I can&#39;t wait  until you&#39;re a really good swimmer. There&#39;s so much 
I want to show you.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s more?&quot; Haruka asked doubtfully, giving her hair a last 
rubdown  with the towel.

&quot;Let me just whet your appetite,&quot; Michiru said, mincing up to her. She  
leaned up to Haruka&#39;s ear. &quot;A &#39;69&#39; at the bottom of the deep end,&quot; she  
whispered, then lightly kissed Haruka on the cheek and walked off with 
an  amorous wiggle to her bottom. Haruka just stared straight ahead, 
then swallowed.

&quot;I think I&#39;d rather face down The Silence,&quot; she mumbled, in shock.</pre>
