<h1>Power Transcendent (part 30 of 31)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessica.html">Jessica</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/powertrans-ch29.html">Back to Part 29</a><pre>Minako knelt by Ami&#39;s bed, resting her head in her folded arms on the 
mattress, watching Ami sleep with a gentle smile on her face. While they 
had spent some very enjoyable time lost in each other&#39;s arms after 
arriving at Ami&#39;s home, the blue haired girl found it difficult to 
pursue that distraction for long. She was still worried about her 
mother, and rather tired from her studying bender the night before. 

So they rested together in Ami&#39;s bed for some time, and when Minako left 
for the bathroom, she had returned to find Ami asleep, snuggled into the 
blankets her girlfriend had just occupied. Ami&#39;s sleeping face seemed a 
bit worried, and Minako thought that she must have trouble escaping her 
problems in her dreams as well. But when Minako couldn&#39;t help herself 
anymore and reached out to gently stroke the sleeping girl&#39;s cheek, she 
stirred, turning her face into Minako&#39;s palm and smiled, though she 
didn&#39;t wake. 

When Ami continued to smile after Minako removed her hand, the blonde 
girl got up and walked out of Ami&#39;s room, wandering silently through the 
living room and thinking. A picture on an end table caught her eye and 
she picked it up. It was a photograph of Ami and her mother, taken not 
too long ago. Dr. Mizuno stood behind her daughter, her arms draped over 
Ami&#39;s shoulders. Both seemed so genuinely happy...it sent a jumble of 
emotions though Minako&#39;s heart. 

She was a bit jealous, she had to admit, but at the same time she was 
happy for Ami&#39;s relationship with her mom. That brought up the usual 
melancholy about Minako&#39;s relationship with her mother, along with the 
anger and guilt left over from their last big fight, which had been the 
last time they&#39;d said two words to each other. 

Then Minako thought of the painting of the snowcapped mountain that was 
hanging on Ami&#39;s bedroom wall. Painted by her father. Ami never talked 
about her divorced father much, but Minako got the feeling that far more 
warmth existed there than between herself and her father, who was still 
nominally married to her mother. 

The man was always away, in England or elsewhere, on business. He was at 
home as little as possible, and Minako frequently suspected that he had 
at least one mistress abroad. Knowing her mother, Minako couldn&#39;t really 
blame him...but she was always a little surprised that he managed to 
remember her name. 

Minako set the picture down and returned to Ami&#39;s room, leaning against 
the doorframe as she watched her love sleep. -Feeling guilty?- The 
little thought trickled through her head and almost went unnoticed 
before Minako recognized it and stood up straight, looking all around 
the room. 

-Who are you?- She called out in her mind, peeking out the door and 
looking around carefully. Of course, there was nothing out there and she 
felt a bit silly for the attempt. When that tiny mental voice made no 
reply, she sighed and decided to answer the question. -Yeah, I guess I 
am.-

-Why? Ami&#39;s worried about her mom discovering she&#39;s a Sailor 
Senshi...she&#39;s really too preoccupied to think about telling her about 
the two of you. It seems like it&#39;s out of your hands for now.-

-That&#39;s the problem.- Minako sighed again. -She&#39;s being silly, and I 
know it. If she wants to tell her mother about all of this, it shouldn&#39;t 
really matter in what order she finds out. But you know how Ami can get 
when she has a plan that isn&#39;t working out. Well, it *seems* like you&#39;d 
know, anyway.- She finished on an accusing note, hoping to get some sort 
of response from this inner voice that sounded so like her. 

But whoever it was refused to take the bait. -So, what are you going to 
do?- Was all it asked. 

-I don&#39;t know...-

-You&#39;re still afraid to admit that you love her.-

-That&#39;s ridiculous.- 

-Have you told her that you love her yet?-

-Well...no.-

-You still think love is a weakness. Your parents, and then Alan and 
Katarina, have made you believe that loving someone will cause them to 
hurt you, intentionally or not. You&#39;re still afraid to love. And with 
how strongly you feel for Ami, you&#39;re very scared indeed.-

-What *are* you?- Minako demanded. -How do you know all this? How are 
you doing this?- But the voice was gone, and again the blonde Senshi was 
forced to wonder if she wasn&#39;t just talking to herself a little too 
much. 

At that moment, Ami began to stir, and Minako quickly slipped into bed 
next to her, sliding her arms around her waist just as she opened her 
eyes. Ami smiled as she felt Minako land next to her. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t 
have let me sleep.&quot; She murmured. 

&quot;But you&#39;re just so cute when you&#39;re asleep.&quot; Minako whispered with a 
grin. Ami blushed sleepily. 

&quot;What time is it?&quot; When Minako told her, her eyes opened fully and she 
started to climb over the other girl to get out of bed. &quot;We&#39;re going to 
be late for the meeting!&quot; She exclaimed, then gave a little yelp as 
Minako pulled her back down, laughing. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry so much.&quot; She chided, giving her a kiss on the forehead. 
&quot;Remember...Usagi and her gang is out with Michiru and hers. Even if we 
take our time, I doubt we&#39;re going to be any later than they are.&quot;

-------------------

That group was currently making their way through the park from the 
skating rink to Haruka and Mamoru&#39;s cars, and an interesting chain 
reaction was taking place. First Haruka, a slight, mischievous smile on 
her face, leaned down and whispered something to Usagi that made her 
eyes widen and her cheeks turn crimson. Not to be outdone, Michiru 
placed a hand on Mamoru&#39;s arm and asked him a question in a flirtatious 
tone that made him cough uncomfortably. 

In response, Usagi immediately seized Mamoru&#39;s other arm possessively 
and yanked him close, still blushing. That, of course, caused Chibi-Usa 
to take hold of his other arm and attempt to pull him away from Usagi. 
This tug-of-war continued for several seconds before Hotaru gently 
placed her hands on the smaller girl&#39;s shoulders. Chibi-Usa immediately 
blushed and let go of her future father&#39;s arm. &quot;Sorry Hotaru.&quot; She said 
softly. 

Hotaru smiled. &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; The two young girls shared a quick embrace 
and began walking again, hand in hand. Everyone else smiled at how cute 
the two of them looked, and when they resumed walking again Haruka 
carried herself with a posture that suggested she wanted everyone to 
believe she had planned the entire thing. Michiru simply smiled 
knowingly at her lover and slid her arm into hers. 

&quot;Was that some kind of game humans like to play?&quot; Diana asked Luna. 

&quot;Sort of.&quot; Artemis supplied. &quot;But it&#39;s sort of hard to follow unless you 
know who playing.&quot;

Diana tilted her head curiously and looked up at the paired-off humans. 
&quot;It looked like they were all playing.&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s a difference between playing and being played with, dear.&quot; Luna 
said. Ahead of them Mamoru rubbed the back of his head in sudden 
embarrassment. 

&quot;So who won?&quot;

&quot;Under the circumstances, I&#39;d say Hotaru.&quot; Luna replied, and the young 
girl suddenly blushed as she walked beside the cats. Chibi-Usa smiled 
and gave Hotaru another hug. 

&quot;What&#39;s going on over there?&quot; Usagi suddenly said, pleasantly oblivious 
and using her free arm to point. Ahead of them on the paved walkway 
there was a knot of people gathered. Their posture suggested that they 
were looking at something on the ground. As the group approached, they 
could hear them discussing whatever it was. 

&quot;Is it oil?&quot; 
 
&quot;I don&#39;t think so...why would oil be piped through the park?&quot; 
 
&quot;It stinks...maybe it&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t smell like sewage. Phew...it *does* stink though.&quot; And 
as the Sailor Senshi approached, they were all forced to agree, holding 
their noses as they crept closer to the source of the odor. It wasn&#39;t 
sewage, but it was an intense stench nonetheless, the smell of a swamp, 
of stagnant water and rotting plants. 

Finally, Mamoru and Haruka, the tallest of the group, were able to 
shoulder forward enough to see what it was. A thick, black liquid, 
almost like tar, was bubbling up from the cracks in the sidewalk. It had 
formed a slick over the concrete and frozen ground almost five feet wide 
already, and still seemed to be growing. 

Then, as they watched, the center of the puddle began to rise up on it&#39;s 
own. When it had lifted about two feet high, it was obvious that it was 
forming itself into a roughly humanoid shape. The crowd began to back up 
slowly, and then a voice came from what looked like the head. It was a 
wet, thick gurgle that sounded like it was coming from the bottom of a 
well, and all it said was, &quot;I smell blood.&quot; 

That was enough for Haruka and Mamoru, and for the rest of the crowd as 
well, who turned and ran immediately. The two looked at each other and 
nodded, turning and hurrying everyone off the path and into the trees. 

&quot;Mamo-chan?&quot; Usagi asked in a confused voice as she was nearly pushed 
into the trees. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s a daeva.&quot; He replied, glancing back over his shoulder. There was 
no sign of it through the fleeing crowd, but the stench in the air was 
thicker than ever.

&quot;You two get Diana out of here and call the others.&quot; Haruka said, 
glancing down at Luna and Artemis. The cats nodded and hurried off 
through the trees. The gathered Senshi all looked at each other and 
nodded. 

&quot;MOON COSMIC POWER!&quot; 
 
&quot;MOON PRISM POWER!&quot; 
 
&quot;SATURN PLANET POWER!&quot; 
 
&quot;URANUS PLANET POWER!&quot;		 
 
&quot;NEPTUNE PLANET POWER!&quot; 
 
&quot;MAKE-UP!&quot;

Transformed, the Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen all leapt out of the 
woods. Everyone had left by now, and the daeva had pulled itself up 
completely. It was humanoid, looking like a person covered in thick, 
clotted mud. It had no visible facial features, and pulled itself along 
as if its feet were sticking to the ground.  

&quot;Hey, daeva!&quot; Sailor Moon called out, and it seemed like the creature 
turned to look at her. With no discernable feature, however, it was hard 
to tell. &quot;You think you can come here and terrify innocent people? 
Whatever you&#39;re here for, we&#39;re going to stop you. I am Sailor Moon, and 
in the name of the moon, I will punish you!&quot;

For a moment, it seemed like the daeva wouldn&#39;t react at all. Then, on 
the rough shape of its head, features finally appeared. There were two 
perfectly round, white eyes with tiny black pupils. And below that, 
teeth. No lips before them or mouth behind, just white, flat teeth. 
&quot;Sailor Senshi...&quot; It gurgled, its teeth moving up and down as it 
spoke. &quot;How fortunate that I find you already.&quot;

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Haruka asked, stepping forward threateningly. 

The thing made a wet, cracking sound and it took the Senshi a moment to 
realize that it was laughing. &quot;My name is meaningless. Among my people, 
I am known as a Gu&#39;tvak. And I am here for you, Sailor Senshi.&quot; Without 
warning it stuck, its body elongating into a snakelike form that whipped 
out towards Uranus with a screeching hiss. Uranus threw herself to the 
ground heavily, revealing Neptune standing just behind her. 

&quot;DEEP SUBMERGE!&quot; The Gu&#39;tvak immediately reared backwards and twisted, 
narrowly avoiding the attack. A hail of roses flew out of the branches 
above the creature and struck in a line down the thing&#39;s length as it 
reformed back into its previous shape. But the projectiles went right 
through the Gu&#39;tvak, hitting the ground covered in black goo. 

&quot;Useless.&quot; It gurgled, and threw itself against the tree Tuxedo Kamen 
stood in. In seconds it had covered the entire tree like a second skin, 
its bizarre face appearing halfway up the trunk. The tree&#39;s branches 
grabbed for Tuxedo Kamen before he could leap away, holding him fast. 

&quot;SPACE SWORD BLASTER!&quot; The gleaming energy blade sped out and cut Tuxedo 
Kamen free, allowing him to leap nimbly to the ground. &quot;Now, Sailor 
Moon!&quot; Uranus called over her shoulder. 

&quot;Right! MOON SPIRAL...&quot; But before Sailor Moon could finish her attack, 
the black thing had left the tree, flying up into the air in a thin, 
amorphous sheet. Seeing a chance, Sailor Saturn leapt into the air, her 
Silence Glaive sweeping through the Gu&#39;tvak. But the blade had no more 
effect than the roses had, save perhaps an increase in the fetid stench. 
Laughing again, the creature drifted away over the trees. 

&quot;We have to catch that thing!&quot; Sailor Moon shouted, running after it. 

&quot;It&#39;s headed for the street!&quot; Neptune called out as the rest began to 
follow. Sailor Moon sprinted through the trees, her eyes on the ominous 
black shape of the Gu&#39;tvak through the leafless branches. As such, she 
was completely unaware of the rather large elm that seemed to jump out 
right in front of her. 

&quot;Ouch! Ow ow ow ow ow!&quot; Sailor Moon landed heavily on her back, 
clutching her face. Tuxedo Kamen stopped to help her up and another 
shape blurred right past them. It was Sailor Uranus, putting all her 
energy in her dash to head the strange daeva off before it could hurt 
someone. The rest of the group fought just to keep her in sight. 

Meanwhile, Sailor Mercury and Sailor Venus were crossing the street 
towards the brick wall that surrounded the park. Artemis was running 
ahead of them, the white cat having split off from the other two cats to 
collect Mercury and Venus, who had been closer than anyone else. 

&quot;Mercury!&quot; Just as Venus hit the sidewalk she stopped and pointed up. 
The Gu&#39;tvak was swiftly drifting down towards them. &quot;What is that 
thing?&quot; 
 
Mercury had her computer on in an instant. &quot;I think it&#39;s the daeva.&quot; She 
said tersely. 

&quot;Good enough for me!&quot; Venus said with a brash smile. &quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot; 
The golden beam sped out, but before it could hit the Gu&#39;tvak it pulled 
itself into a ball, plummeting to the pavement behind them with a loud, 
wet smack that filled the air with its stink. It sat in the street in an 
unmoving pool, and Mercury and Venus cautiously crept forward to 
investigate. 

&quot;Get away from it!&quot; Uranus shouted, leaping over the high brick wall. 
Venus whipped her head around to look at the exact moment the Gu&#39;tvak 
stirred, twisting out of its puddle form into a shape like some 
gargantuan, wide-mouthed eel that sped right for her. 

&quot;No!&quot; Uranus shouted, smashing Venus out of the way with her shoulder as 
she landed. The save cost her, however, as the Gu&#39;tvak enveloped her 
instead. With a triumphant shriek the long black shape turned and, quick 
as thought, smashed through a manhole cover and vanished into the 
sewers. 

&quot;Haruka, NO!&quot; The anguished wail made Mercury and Venus turn back to the 
wall, where Neptune had arrived just in time to see the whole thing, a 
disbelieving, horrified expression on her face.  

-------------------

An hour later, the light began to fail and the Sailor Senshi began to 
gather at Rei&#39;s shrine. They had split into three groups to search the 
sewers, and were all rather the worse for wear. Tuxedo Kamen, Sailor 
Moon, Chibi-Moon and Saturn were the first to arrive, followed by Venus, 
Mercury and Jupiter. Quite a bit later, Pluto and Rei arrived, 
practically holding Neptune up between them. They were all tired and 
filthy, and didn&#39;t even bother transforming back. 

&quot;She&#39;s exhausted.&quot; Pluto explained. &quot;She must have covered twice as much 
ground as we did.&quot; They carefully sat Neptune on the steps. She was 
conscious, but her eyes showed that she was a very distant and extremely 
unpleasant place. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t find anything?&quot; Sailor Moon asked Mercury, who sadly shook 
her head. 

&quot;I couldn&#39;t pick it up again on my computer anywhere. It&#39;s probably in 
Tachyon&#39;s lair, wherever that is.&quot; She nearly wiped her eyes with her 
hand, but seeing the condition of her gloves, reconsidered. 

&quot;I want to go back.&quot; Neptune said in a soft, neutral tone. 

&quot;Neptune...&quot; Sailor Moon said softly, her own face a mask of worry and 
sadness that was mirrored on everyone else. 

&quot;We can&#39;t do anything more down there.&quot; Pluto said in a gentle tone. &quot;We 
should get cleaned up and rest, and try to think of something else...&quot; 
 
&quot;There&#39;s no time!&quot; Neptune said in a harsh, shaking voice. &quot;Tachyon 
probably sent that thing, and who knows what she&#39;s doing to Haruka?&quot; 
Biting her lip to hold back her tears, Neptune hugged herself tightly, 
her shoulders jerking with repressed sobs. 

Rei stood back from the group a short distance, watching. Her hands 
curled into tightly clenched fists and when Neptune finally broke down 
and began to cry, she turned her face away, her eyes closing to hide her 
own tears that were threatening to well up. She took a deep breath, and 
let it out slowly as she walked over and sat next to Neptune, placing a 
hand on the aqua-haired Senshi&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;Go on home...&quot; She turned and looked at all the others. &quot;All of you. Go 
home, clean up and rest for a bit. Then come back here. I have an idea.&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; Neptune asked, her crying fading as she turned to look at 
the dark-haired miko. Rei gave her a small smile.  
 
&quot;Trust me.&quot; Rei stood and headed into her room. She could hear the 
Sailor Senshi leaving, muttering questions among themselves. 

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; Rei turned. It was Jupiter. &quot;What are you going to do, Rei-
chan?&quot;

&quot;Something.&quot; Rei said with quiet confidence. &quot;Just like you told me to.&quot; 
 
Jupiter blinked in surprise, then smiled herself, and nodded. &quot;Just be 
careful.&quot; She said, leaving Rei to her darkened room. Rei took another 
deep breath, then stopped with a cough. With the smell of the sewers 
surrounding her, she realized she should take as few deep breaths as 
possible until she was in the shower. She smiled again. Suddenly, she 
felt more purposeful and at peace with herself than she had in many 
days. For the first time since Tachyon had wounded her, she knew 
precisely who she was and what she had to do. Now, it was just a matter 
of doing it. 

Rei took a very long shower, both to remove all trace of the sewer and 
to clear her mind. She would need all her concentration for what was to 
come. Once she was out and her hair was more or less dry, she put on her 
white kimono and red hakama, and headed into the shrine. After feeding 
the flame a bit, she knelt down in front of it and began to chant. 

This idea had been percolating in Rei&#39;s head ever since Makoto had put 
her in her place. She couldn&#39;t become a Sailor Senshi thanks to Tachyon, 
it was true. But she was still a priestess, and that gave her abilities 
she doubted the little psycho was prepared to deal with. 

As she chanted, the room around her began to fade from her senses. Soon, 
she was all alone; the only things she was aware of were the fire and 
the soft sound of her own voice. She had driven herself to exhaustion 
like this once before, but then she had been trying to scry the future, 
which Tachyon had specialized in hiding from her and Setsuna&#39;s view. And 
seeing the future like this was always chancy, at best. 

But now, she was trying to find something that had been lost, and that 
was something Rei had always had a talent for. The fact that this 
&#39;thing&#39; was the beloved of the woman *she* loved made no difference. 
Haruka was lost, and Rei *would* find her. 

With Rei&#39;s intense level of concentration, she didn&#39;t realize she was 
being watched by a figure crouched just outside the door to the shrine. 
This figure peered carefully through the crack between the sliding 
doors, 
watching silently. Then she felt a hand on her shoulder and nearly 
jumped a foot in the air in shock. 

&quot;Mako-chan.&quot; Michiru said softly, offering the smallest of smiles in 
greeting. Makoto caught her breath and nodded. &quot;What are you doing 
here?&quot; The older girl whispered. 

&quot;I wanted to make sure she wasn&#39;t doing anything dangerous.&quot; Makoto 
replied, just as softly. 

&quot;I did too...as worried as I am for Haruka, I didn&#39;t want Rei to be on 
my conscience again.&quot; Michiru said, looking into the shrine over 
Makoto&#39;s head. Makoto glanced up at her, the corner of her mouth quirked 
upwards. 

&quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot; She offered softly. Michiru glanced down and 
smiled a bit.  
 
&quot;Thank you, Mako-chan.&quot; They watched in silence for a long moment. &quot;What 
do you think she&#39;s doing?&quot; 
 
&quot;Looking for Haruka.&quot; 
 
&quot;Do you think it will work?&quot; 
 
&quot;I think she&#39;s not moving until it does.&quot;

Rei had sunk into a kind of subspace. Even the sound of her own chanting 
had faded away, and there was only the fire before her. -Haruka, where 
are you...- Without warning, the image of Tachyon&#39;s laughing face 
appeared before Rei&#39;s eyes. -There!- Before, when she had been trying to 
find a vision of the future, she had seen that face when Tachyon had 
blocked her. Then, she had been unable to fight back against it, that 
block too firm a seal on visions of time. 

But now Rei wasn&#39;t trying to see through time. And now that wall that 
the child had put up had a substance that Rei could push back against. 
Rather than let that image slip away, Rei grabbed hold of it and tried 
to force her way through it. The fire suddenly sprang up twice as high, 
but Rei couldn&#39;t feel it as she bent the full force of her formidable 
will against Tachyon&#39;s shield. 

Now the fire was all around her, licking hungrily at her clothes. Her 
hair flew up in the hot wind of the flames, and still she fought. The 
heat was rising up to choke her, but she knew that it couldn&#39;t harm her 
unless she let her concentration wane. Then, just as she had reached the 
last of her strength, Tachyon&#39;s grinning face shattered like a mirror, 
and Rei&#39;s awareness was sent hurtling outwards. For an instant, she 
could see all of Tokyo spread out before her, glittering with lights in 
the night air. 

Then she was falling, falling...there was an mansion, an old, western 
style mansion, just outside of the city. And there, in a bedroom on the 
top floor...there she was! Feeling her will fading utterly, Rei quickly 
flew back to her own body, feeling the return of gravity with a 
suddenness that made her head spin. 

Michiru and Makoto had been watching her this whole time, and now they 
rushed in, catching Rei just before she pitched forward face-first into 
the flame. They laid her back against the floor, carefully. There was 
blood trickling down from her nostrils, and her eyelids fluttered. 

&quot;Rei-chan? Rei-chan!&quot; Makoto shook her shoulder firmly, and Rei&#39;s eyes 
cracked open. 

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot; She murmured. &quot;I did it!&quot; There was triumph in that 
whisper, and her eyes drifted over to Michiru. &quot;I found her Michiru-
chan...I know where she is...and she&#39;s alright.&quot;

Michiru smiled, tears running down her cheeks as she nodded. &quot;Thank you 
Rei-chan...thank you!&quot;

&quot;We can go...when the others get here.&quot; Rei said, trying to push her way 
up. Makoto stopped her. 

&quot;You should rest...it looks like that took a lot out of you.&quot; She said 
gently, but firmly. 

&quot;No...I need to go, to make sure Haruka gets out safely.&quot; Rei said, too 
tired to do anything but protest weakly. Michiru suddenly looked down at 
her, an unreadable expression on her face. 

&quot;Mako-chan...I&#39;m sorry, but would you let me talk to her for a moment?&quot; 
She asked, and Makoto paused for a moment, then nodded and left without 
another word, her face devoid of expression. Michiru helped Rei up into 
a sitting position and neither said anything for a long moment. 

&quot;Rei-chan...I think I owe you another apology.&quot; The aqua-haired woman 
finally said. Rei blinked in surprise and looked over at her. 

&quot;For what?&quot; 
 
&quot;For underestimating your feelings. This whole time, I&#39;ve been passing 
this off as nothing more than a crush, but it *is* more than that, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

Rei, who had been cleaning herself up with a handkerchief, froze. &quot;I...I 
don&#39;t...&quot; She stopped and closed her eyes. &quot;So you know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve known for awhile, Rei-chan.&quot; 
 
&quot;I guess I sort of realized that.&quot; Rei said, standing up and walking a 
short distant away. &quot;If you knew, why didn&#39;t you say something before 
this?&quot; She demanded, turning back sharply. 

&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m apologizing, Rei-chan.&quot; Michiru said softly, and Rei 
blushed and nodded. To be honest, I thought it was just a crush. An 
angry flush appeared on Rei&#39;s cheeks and Michiru held a hand up to fend 
off Rei&#39;s retort. &quot;Please let me finish. You have to understand, I had 
no way of knowing the depth of your feelings. And if it had been just a 
crush, telling you that I know would have just embarrassed you. And so I 
decided the best course of action was to let things run their course. 
All crushes fade away, given time.&quot;

Michiru got up then and walked over to where Rei stood, and placed her 
hands on the raven-haired miko&#39;s shoulders. Rei looked up, her cheeks 
pink again, but not with anger. &quot;I was wrong, very wrong.&quot; Michiru gave 
her a small, sad smile. &quot;I saw it in your eyes, Rei-chan. What you&#39;ve 
done here, you&#39;ve done for me.&quot;

Rei lowered her eyes, and Michiru smiled. &quot;Why, Rei-chan?&quot; She asked in 
a voice of soft encouragement. 

&quot;I...I just want you to be happy.&quot; Rei whispered. &quot;And I know...Haruka 
can make you happier than I ever could.&quot; Michiru saw a single tear 
trickle down Rei&#39;s cheek and fall to the wooden floor. &quot;I love you 
Michiru-chan.&quot; Her voice began to shake. &quot;But it&#39;s not just 
that...that&#39;s not the only reason I did this...&quot; 
 
&quot;Shhh, I know, I know. You would have done all you could to help, even 
if you didn&#39;t feel this way. But there&#39;s nothing selfish about doing 
something good for the sake of love. And sometimes love can drive us to 
do things that we normally couldn&#39;t. And I&#39;m very grateful for that, 
Rei-chan.&quot;

&quot;I never had a chance from the beginning, did I?&quot; Rei asked in a dull 
voice, staring at the ground. Michiru&#39;s expression was deeply 
sympathetic as she took her hands from Rei&#39;s shoulder and looked at her 
closely. 

&quot;Because I think you need to hear it, I&#39;ll say it.&quot; Michiru finally 
said. &quot;No, Rei-chan. You didn&#39;t. But...&quot; Michiru slipped her hand 
beneath Rei&#39;s chin and lifted her eyes to meet hers. &quot;I care for you, 
very much. Even among the Sailor Senshi, you&#39;re one of the people who 
are most precious to me. I know it&#39;s a poor substitute for what your 
heart longs for, but I want you to know how important you are to me.&quot;

&quot;I know, Michiru-chan...&quot; Rei sniffed and rubbed at her eyes. &quot;I know.&quot; 
 
&quot;It hurts, I know...&quot; Michiru started, reaching out to Rei, but Rei 
gently deflected her hand. 

&quot;No...please stop. I couldn&#39;t take it right now, and you don&#39;t have 
time. You have to go rescue the one you love, right?&quot; Rei&#39;s voice gained 
in strength and she looked back at the fire. And at that moment, Makoto 
knocked softly on the door. 

&quot;Rei-chan, Michiru-chan...everyone&#39;s here.&quot; 
 
Michiru smiled. &quot;Well, are you ready to go?&quot; Rei looked up in surprise, 
and Michiru nodded. &quot;I don&#39;t have the right to tell you to stay behind 
if you&#39;re willing to come, Rei-chan. You&#39;re capable of taking care of 
yourself, and of looking out for the rest of us. Just as we&#39;ll be 
looking out for you. That&#39;s part of being a Sailor Senshi.&quot;

A small, determined smile appeared over Rei&#39;s lips, and she nodded a 
bit. A very short time later, the doors to the shrine opened, and 
Michiru and Rei stepped out. The rest of the Sailor Senshi and Mamoru 
stood expectantly in the courtyard, and Rei looked over them all 
carefully. She took a deep breath. &quot;I know where Haruka is.&quot; She said. 
&quot;And tonight we&#39;re going to get her back.&quot;

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: If one was to look back at Chapter 29, you might notice 
that the little teaser at the end is gone now. That applied to the 
earlier version of this chapter which I realized absolutely sucked after 
I&#39;d written about half of it. I like this new version much, much better. 
I&#39;m hoping you like it too!

I don&#39;t own Sailormoon or any of the characters thereof. I do own the 
original characters, though, so keep your hands off them!
