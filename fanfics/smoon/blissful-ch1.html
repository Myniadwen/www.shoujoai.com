<h1>Blissful Beginnings</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragon.html">Dragon</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Usagi stepped into the room and stared at the Shinto priestess.  She 
was in nothing but a towel, and it wasn&#39;t wrapped around her body.  Her
eyes widened as the raven-haired goddess stretched sensually in front of
her, arching her back and protruding her breasts into the air.  Her
nipples were hard from the cold, and her milk white flesh was glistening
with water droplets from the tub she had just stepped out of.

Usagi watched in fascination as the beauty before her shook her hair out
of the white towel, and then continued to shake her hair till the rest
of the water was out of it.  The blonde didn&#39;t even notice the drops of
water that landed on her clothes and skin.  Usagi wanted to reach out
and touch the girl, caress the silky skin only a few feet away from her
hands; she burned with the need to feel that body beneath her hands...
and her lips.

It was then that the woman noticed her staring at her.  She turned 
toward Usagi, not bothering to cover her nude body.  Her nipples stood
at perfect attention, swollen to the size of raspberries and begging for
a hand or mouth to play with them.

&quot;Usa, what are you doing here?&quot;  The pet name only a select few were 
aloud to use caused Usagi to shiver with pleasure.  She wanted the 
priestess in a way she had never wanted anybody else.  Her body ached
for the woman, causing her groin to become tight with need.

&quot;I-I was looking for you.&quot; The answer sounded silly, even to her own 
ears, but she didn&#39;t know what else to say.  She tried to continue, but
she couldn&#39;t get her mouth to work.  She could feel it moving, but no
sound was protruding past her lips.

&quot;Well, here I am.  What did you want?&quot;  Rei continued to dry her hair 
with the towel, bending over and letting her breasts dangle.  They
swayed in the air, dripping water, and it caused Usagi to inhale
sharply.

&#39;I want you&#39; she thought, her eyes wandering all over the woman&#39;s bare
body, memorizing every inch of the creamy flesh.  &quot;Well?&quot;

Usagi looked into Rei&#39;s face and tried desperately to remember why she 
had come barging in here.  It took her a moment, but only because Rei 
decided that was the perfect time to stretch her arms into the air and 
moan slightly.  Usagi shivered with desire, but quickly bit down on her 
tongue to stop her wandering thoughts.

&quot;I-I thought we were going o-out today.&quot;   She was trying so hard not to
stammer, and, of course, it failed miserably.  She could feel her face 
become warm with a nice crimson blush, but decided not to fight it.  
Instead she decided to look around the room and focus her attention on 
something, anything, besides Rei.

&quot;Oh yeah.  I didn&#39;t realize it was twelve o&#39;clock already.&quot;  Despite how
hard she tried to keep them focused on other things in the room, Usagi&#39;s
eyes continued to wander in Rei&#39;s direction.  The posters of hot, female
singers didn&#39;t even keep her gaze for long, and as she feared, Rei 
noticed.

&quot;Usagi, does my being naked bother you?  If it does, tell me.&quot;  Rei&#39;s 
red-black eyes stared into Usagi&#39;s baby blue ones, the concern in them 
causing the blonde to want to tell her everything was fine, that she 
didn&#39;t mind.  But she did mind.  Usagi had been hiding her attraction
toward women for years, and she didn&#39;t want any of her friends to find
out.  If they did, they&#39;d freak, and probably decide that Usagi was one
to stay distant from.  The only soul to know was her mom, and that was
only because mothers have this strange way of sensing things like that,
and hers had confronted Usagi on it when she was thirteen.  Now she was
seventeen, and her very happiness depended on no one else finding out 
that she was a lesbian.  However, at the moment, Rei was making it very 
hard for her to keep said secret.

&quot;No, it&#39;s fine.  I just feel embarrassed because I barged in like that 
without knocking first.  It was rude, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  Usagi smiled her best
smile, then focused her attention on another pop idol to keep her mind 
from wandering toward how very naked Rei was.

&quot;Oh, okay then.&quot;  Usagi glanced over at the black haired beauty to see
if she really believed her.  What she saw, however, nearly made her
gasp.  Rei had smirked; that little smile that says &quot;I know what&#39;s
really up, you can&#39;t hide it from me.&quot;  If Usagi hadn&#39;t looked over, she
never would have caught it, and now she didn&#39;t know what to do about it.

&#39;She knows! Oh, Goddess, she knows.  And she&#39;s probably trying to get 
me to crack so she can prove it!  What am I going to do?&#39;  Usagi&#39;s
thoughts raced through her head, swirling around as if in a whirlpool.
She couldn&#39;t think of what to do or say, and all the while her eyes 
continued to watch the beauty before her as if Rei was a chocolate
milkshake, and she were starving.  &#39;Just stay cool, nothing can happen
if you stay cool.&#39;  She thought to herself, taking a deep breath and
averting her eyes once again.

&quot;Mmmm.&quot; Usagi stuffed her fists into the pockets of her jacket and 
clenched them in frustration.  The soft moans coming from her friends 
lips were driving her insane.  &#39;Why IS she moaning, anyway?&#39;  Usagi 
wondered.  She looked around for something to look at and finally found
a recent magazine about the idols in Tokyo.  Picking it up, she began to
leaf through the pages as if she were reading, all the while watching
Rei from behind it.

Rei sat on her bed, staring at her ceiling as she arced her back in a 
stretch.  Usagi&#39;s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as she 
watched the beautiful woman raise her arms into the air.  The pale pink
of the girl&#39;s nipples was no longer perked and hard, but it didn&#39;t
matter, the sheer sight of her being naked caused Usagi&#39;s groin to
tighten more.

Thinking her gaze was hidden behind the magazine, Usagi let her eyes 
wander up and down the girl&#39;s body.  She was wearing a pair of black
silk panties now, her other clothes sitting beside her on the bed.  Her
thin stomach was flat and hid her well-developed abs quite well, though
they were presenting themselves as Rei twisted her upper body to try and
crack her back.  Her breasts swayed as she did so, the cool breeze the
movement made causing the nipples to harden slightly, but not
completely; not the way they had been when she was wet from her bath.

&quot;Ohh...I can tell it wants to pop.&quot;  Her voice was husky, her full lips 
forming each word slowly as she fought the strained muscles in her 
back, her eyes closing to concentrate.

&quot;What?&quot; Usagi shook herself out of her reverie to pay attention to what 
Rei was saying.  Rei looked at her, a smile in her eyes, and mentioned 
how much she wished to pop her back, but that it wouldn&#39;t oblige her.

&quot;Well, maybe I can help.&quot;  Usagi stood, her need to feel Rei&#39;s silky 
skin beneath her hands overcoming her sensibility.

&quot;Would you really, Usa?  I know you&#39;re really good at popping people&#39;s 
backs, and it would be wonderful if you&#39;d pop mine.&quot;  Rei beamed at 
Usagi as the blonde walked toward the bed, then quickly lied on her
stomach, presenting Usagi with a beautiful rear view of her body.  Usagi
inhaled sharply as her eyes traveled up and down the curve of Rei&#39;s
back, first starting with her neck, then falling down her spine and
stopping at her taught buttocks.  She was only a little surprised to see
that the black panties she had thought Rei was wearing were really a
thong, and the view she had of the tight, milky flesh of Rei&#39;s butt made
her quiver with desire.

Shaking it off, Usagi straddled Rei&#39;s back so as to use her body weight
to crack it.  Her eyes widened as the feeling of the woman&#39;s soft skin 
against her exposed thighs reminded her she was in a skirt.  She nearly
broke then, but swallowed and continued to settle herself so she could
help out her friend.  She ran her hands up and down Rei&#39;s back, asking
her to breath in and out, then she pressed down with her palms and was
pleased to hear several soft cracks as Rei&#39;s spine settled into a more
comfortable position.

Rei moaned in pleasure as Usagi continued to rub at her back to make 
sure everything was okay.  The blonde breathed deeply as she did so,
trying to get a hold of her emotions, but she was fighting a loosing
battle, and she knew it.  She sat up and unstraddled the tempting body
of the black haired goddess, praying that Rei hadn&#39;t felt how wet she
was, and watched the beauty as she stretched, catlike, into a sitting
position.


&quot;That feel&#39;s so much better.  Thank you so much, Usa.&quot;  Rei turned to 
her friend and smiled a dazzling smile of thanks.

&quot;No problem, what are friends for?&quot;  Usagi swallowed as she looked into 
Rei&#39;s mesmerizing eyes and felt her body go alternately hot and cold.  
Their bodies were so close to one another, teasing the blonde with how
easy it would be to just reach out and touch her.

She tried desperately to play it &#39;cool,&#39; but she found it to be a lot 
harder than she could have wished.  Her eyes kept falling to the supple 
breasts only a foot from her hand, breasts that were just the perfect
size to be cupped in the blonde&#39;s delicate fingers, or placed in her
mouth to taste and feast upon.  They kept wandering down the toned
stomach and perfect thighs, thighs that were spread apart just so,
giving a perfect view of the clean-shaven sex between them, even if the
sheer fabric of the thong covered that sweet place.

&quot;Usa, are you okay? You seem distracted.&quot;  Rei&#39;s voice whispered 
sensually into the air, husky, deep and sexually demanding to the 
blonde&#39;s ears.  She could feel a hand settle on her own, and her baby
blue eyes glanced at it briefly, realizing how much she wanted that
hand to be touching something a little higher than her hand.  Then she
gazed into the red-black eyes of her temptress.  She couldn&#39;t read the
need that gleamed in those eyes, a need that matched her own.  She was
too busy trying to fight her body for control.  Then the black haired
beauty caressed the blonde&#39;s hand ever so softly, and her control broke.

Usagi could hear the rational part of her mind yelling at her as she 
leaned forward, but she ignored it.  She could see the images of all her
friends turning away from her because Rei would tell them what happened,
but she didn&#39;t care.  All that she wanted at this moment was to feel
those full lips against her own, to feel that gorgeous body wrapped in
her arms and pressed to her.

Her left arm snaked around Rei&#39;s delicate waist while her right hand 
cupped the back of her neck, entwining it&#39;s fingers into her silky,
black hair.  She didn&#39;t realize that Rei wasn&#39;t fighting; all her
attention was focused on those lips and how wonderful it would feel to
taste them.  She tilted the priestess&#39; head back, then brushed her pink
lips against Rei&#39;s ever so softly, and as the craving took over, she
kissed Rei hungrily, pressing their lips together with fierce passion.
Then she stopped, her eyes opening wide as she realized what she was
doing.  She was about to pull away, when Rei&#39;s arms encircling her waist
stopped her from moving any further.

&quot;No, don&#39;t stop.  I want this.  I want you, Usa.  Please, keep going.&quot;
Usagi looked deeply into Rei&#39;s eyes and nearly chocked at what she saw 
there.  They were filled with a hunger as deep as her own, and what&#39;s 
more, they were filled with love.  It was a love Usagi thought she&#39;d
never see directed toward her, and it made her heart melt.

So, instead of pulling away, the blonde pulled her lve closer to her 
body and pressed her lips to Rei&#39;s once again in a tender kiss.  The
beauty in her arms arched her back and pressed her lips deeper into the
kiss, enhancing the passion to new heights and causing the blondes body
to shiver with pleasure.  It wasn&#39;t enough.  Usagi wanted a better
taste, and there was only one way to get it.  She slipped her tongue
into Rei&#39;s mouth and explored it, taking in every inch of her mouth.
Their tongues twined around each other like snakes, playing with each
other and causing the heat to rise between them, as well as between
their legs.

Usagi pressed Rei to her, feeling her bare breasts rub against the 
cloth that covered her own, aching breasts, and it drove her insane.
She wanted, needed to feel her bare body against that of Rei&#39;s.

&quot;This will never do.&quot; Rei broke off the kiss and took the hem of Usagi&#39;s
shirt in her hands.  &quot;It just will never do.&quot;  Her voice was hushed, her
eyes telling of how much she wanted to be Usagi&#39;s lover.  She lifted the
shirt, slowly removing it from the blonde&#39;s body until it was completely
off and tossed to the floor.  Then she wrapped her arms around Usagi and
took the blonde&#39;s bra into her hands and began to slowly unclasp it.

&quot;I want your naked body against mine.  I want to touch you and taste you
in every way, Usa.&quot;  Rei pulled the bra off, letting the straps drag 
against the blondes skin sensually.  Usa moaned deep in her throat, her
body aching for Rei&#39;s delicate fingers to roam all over it.  As she
tossed the bra behind her to be forgotten, her hand continued to caress
down her back until it reached the zipper of her skirt.  She unzipped
it, dragging it down, making Usa bite her lip as the heat between her
legs became stronger.  Fingernails skimmed across Usa&#39;s thighs as the
skirt was pulled off, her body shivering in response.

Usagi couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  Leaning forward she began to kiss 
down Rei&#39;s neck, nibbling as she did so, until she reached the supple
flesh of her lover&#39;s right breast.  She fondled it gently, pinching at
the hard nipples and massaging the skin playfully with her hands.  Rei&#39;s
head tilted back and a soft moan escaped her full lips, then she gasped
as Usa began to suck on her hard nipples.

&quot;Oh, Usa...&quot; She closed her eyes in pleasure, her head tilting back as
she moaned with each soft suckle of Usa&#39;s mouth.  Usagi alternated
between breasts, suckling one while fondling the other. Then, as she
sucked on Rei&#39;s left breast, she took the straps of her lover&#39;s thong
panties in her fingers and slid them down Rei&#39;s thighs.  She gazed at
her love&#39;s sex, taking in everything about it, then looked into Rei&#39;s
hazy eyes. She kissed her love&#39;s mouth softly, while spreading her
thighs apart.

&quot;Oh, yes! USAGI!!&quot; Her words were moaned at the top of her lungs as Usa 
pushed two fingers in and out of her wet tunnel.  She sucked on Rei&#39;s 
breasts and pumped her fingers madly, quickening her speed as Rei 
bucked beneath her.  Rei fell back on the bed as Usa pumped her fingers
in and out of her, her moans filling the room.  Then Usagi dipped her
head down and began to suck at her lover&#39;s clit, continuing to pump her
fingers in rhythm with Rei&#39;s bucking.  Rei screamed as thrills of
pleasure rolled up and down her body.

&quot;Oh yes! Oh God, Usagi, don&#39;t stop!&quot;  But the moaning emanating from her
lover&#39;s mouth was only making her need to be touched grow, until, 
finally, it was too much for her.

Usagi stopped her ministrations and looked at her lover&#39;s angel-face.  
It was flushed and a light beading of sweat was already glistening on
her forehead.  She looked at Usagi, a pout forming on her lips as her
moans of pleasure turned to groans of frustration.

&quot;W-why did you stop?&quot;  Her voice was a mere whisper, but the intense, 
aching need that Usagi could hear in it nearly made the blonde forget 
her own needs and continue pleasuring her goddess.  She couldn&#39;t ignore
the wetness of her sex, though, so she did the only thing she could
think of.

Rei was about to speak again, so Usagi pressed her lips to Rei&#39;s once 
more in a wet, passionate kiss.  When the kiss broke Usagi pressed her
lips to Rei&#39;s ear, then said the only thing she wished to say.

&quot;I love you Rei.  I always have and I always will.&quot;  With that, Usa 
straddled Rei so that her wet sex was against that of her lovers, then
she rubbed them together, bringing them both a pleasure that they had 
never felt before.  Waves of pleasure wracked their bodies as they 
bucked with each other on the bed, their lips meeting in warm, wet
kisses as they moaned.  Then, as their motions quickened with the rising
feeling of sweet pleasure, Rei screamed.

Usagi opened her eyes wide and looked down at her lover.  Rei&#39;s back 
was arched, her head tilted back and her mouth opened in a silent
scream.  Usagi bucked her hips, her slick sex rubbing against that of 
her lovers, then shuddered deeply as her own climax passed over her,
starting from the center of her sex and spreading like a wildfire
across her body.  She moaned loudly as her body slowed with her passing
orgasm, and then she collapsed onto the bed, falling sideways so as not
to land on her partner.  Rei lay on her back, her breasts heaving as she
gasped for air.

&quot;That...was...a...mazing!&quot;  Rei looked over at Usagi and smiled, her
eyes had a glazed over look to them and her cheeks were still flushed
from their excursion.

&quot;Yes...it was.&quot;  Usa turned on her side, then scooted closer to her new 
lover and wrapped her arms around her.  She couldn&#39;t help but smile with
happiness at everything that had happened.  It was almost to good to be 
true, but it was true.  She had just had sex with the most beautiful 
woman she knew.  And to top it all off, it was the one woman she had
been in love with since she was 13.  She had never dared dream that she
would have Rei in her arms, but here she was, holding her beloved after
making love to her.

Rei snuggled closer to the exhausted blonde, folding her arms into her 
chest and laying her head against Usagi&#39;s soft bosom.  She felt her 
love&#39;s soft hands entwine into her hair, brushing it slowly with her
nails, and was amazed at how good it felt.  Then, as her eyes drifted
closed and both their breathing started to settle into that of the
sleeping, Rei&#39;s soft voice whispered into the blissful moment.

&quot;I love you, too, Usa.&quot;  And with that, she settled into her love&#39;s 
embrace as they both drifted into dreamland, their mouths curved into 
small smiles as they slept.
