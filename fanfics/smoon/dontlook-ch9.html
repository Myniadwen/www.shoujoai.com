<h1>Don't Look Back (part 9 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dontlook-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>7am seemed to come too early for Haruka as she reached up to slam her 
hand onto the annoying alarm-clock that kept telling her it was time 
to get up. She sat up; groggily running a hand through her hair as the 
regretful turn of events for the night before came back to her full 
force. It had been going well for her, Michiru had been willing and 
able, but something had pulled the blonde back, something nagging her 
at the back of her mind. Michiru had taken her withdraw the wrong way, 
and Haruka had ended up sitting there with a glass of Bailey&#146;s dumped 
on her head.

Definitely not the way she&#146;d have liked things to have gone.

Walking out of the bathroom after a quick shower, she was shocked to 
find a note in the kitchen rather then the cheerful morning person 
who&#146;d been living with her for the last week. Picking up the note, she 
felt slightly disappointed.

Hey Haruka,

I came and took your beloved Michiru away with me. Sorry girl, but the 
poor thing needed more new clothes. Not everyone can live on the sorry 
amount of clothes you call a wardrobe. Anyway, we&#146;ll be there on time. 
Setsuna is with us to make sure of that. Mike will pick you up in half 
an hour since you&#146;ve probably just dragged yourself out of bed an hour 
before we have to LEAVE. Get a grip girl. See ya later.

Lil.

PS: Michiru&#146;s still mad about something, watch it.

&#147;She has to find out about everything doesn&#146;t she.&#148; The blonde 
grumbled irritably, crunching the note in one hand before setting to 
finish packing up her stuff before her cousin arrived.

Mike probably knew too, and she&#146;d never make it to the meeting without 
having all the details dragged out and made fun of.

Joy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&#147;Smile Michiru, you can&#146;t stay mad forever.&#148; Lil laughed, her accent 
seeming slightly frosty after two hours of having the other girl sulk.

Setsuna frowned at her, shaking her head slowly as they all sat 
waiting with the other girls by the buses, suits and equipment being 
loaded up and packed into dark vans with &#147;Ten&#39;oh Inc.&#148; plastered on 
the sides.

Michiru gave them a weak smile, still badly hurt from Haruka&#146;s 
rejection but understanding of Lil&#146;s irritability. She fought down a 
flutter of anticipation as the sound of a motorcycle could be heard 
roaring toward them, before it was seen following a dark black jeep 
into the parking lot.

&#147;Mike!&#148; Lil called, jumping up from the bench as the bike slowed to a 
crawl before stopping completely. Grey eyes glinting devilishly, Lil 
grabbed hold of Michiru&#146;s arm, dragging her off the bench as she ran 
toward the bike, surprising Michiru with her strength as she was 
dragged helplessly along.

&#147;Hello darling, I missed you.&#148; The British murmured adoringly as she 
leaned up to kiss her lover, taking a moment to whisper something in 
the tomboy&#146;s ear. Mike nodded, giving Haruka a wink before leading a 
triumphant Lil away before she could cause anymore havoc.

&#147;Michiru, please listen to me-&#148;Haruka began before a shrill voice 
called her name, seconds before a scantily clad body threw itself at 
her. Haruka caught the girl, glaring harshly as she noticed whom it 
was she had caught.

&#147;Hello baby, how&#146;ve you been without me?&#148; Sarah murmured, flicking a 
disgusted look at Michiru over her shoulder, &#147;do you mind?&#148;

&#147;No actually, not at all.&#148; The aqua haired girl snapped, turning on 
her heel to storm away, causing a few people to glance after her 
before giving Haruka dirty looks. Setsuna glared at the beautiful 
black haired girl clinging to her employer before walking up, tapping 
the girl politely on the shoulder.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry Sarah, but you&#146;re not in this shoot. You&#146;ll have to leave 
now, the group must go.&#148; The green haired woman murmured, reaching 
forward to untangle the girl&#146;s arms from around Haruka&#146;s neck. Haruka 
gave a sigh of relief before running in the direction Michiru had 
gone. Setsuna felt a slight chill run up her spine as the girl turned 
to regard her coldly.

&#147;Listen up Setsuna, no sense giving me that little I&#146;m-the-boss act. 
Haruka is mine, you little bitch, and if you check your little board 
again, you&#146;ll find I *am* on this trip, got me?&#148; Sarah snarled, 
flicking her short black hair back from her face before turning on a 
heel to storm onto one of the buses.

&#147;She&#146;s right Setsuna. I ordered her to come. You can take the subject 
up with me if you want to, but leave Haruka out of it. Mr. Ten&#39;oh has 
personal feelings in the matter, so he is not aloud to make business 
decisions on the matter.&#148; Derek chided, slipping up to stand beside 
the woman, sliding an around about her shoulders. Setsuna felt ill as 
she shrugged his hand off her shoulder, but had to admit he was right. 
Looking over at where Haruka was nearly pleading Michiru for her 
forgiveness, she felt a slight premonition that the two wouldn&#146;t have 
happiness for a while&#133;

~*~

Haruka sat in the sun on the beach she&#146;d been on last night with 
Michiru, a brooding look in her eyes as she stared blankly down the 
beach a patch of messed up sand, the tire treks from her bike still 
slightly visible.

&#147;Mr. Ten&#39;oh! Everything is ready for you and Mrs. Chiba to start 
shooting now.&#148; Setsuna called, smiling as she turned to catch a 
glimpse of the aqua haired Michiru gazing dreamily at the blonde 
before she found something interesting on the canopy above her head. 
Everyone was slightly tense, as it always was before they got into the 
swing of a long-term project. Each of the models wore a suit to match 
them, as Setsuna had made sure of. The first line being string bikinis 
with a Dragon design on them, she&#146;d matched each with a color that 
would set the standards for the rest of the shoot. Rei was in colors 
of Red and purple, Makoto in pinks and greens, Ami in Blues and 
silvers, Minako in yellows and oranges, and Michiru in majestic 
pastels that matched the ocean. Sarah, on the other hand, wore black 
and brown, which she seemed insulted by, claiming she should wear 
Michiru&#146;s lines of suits.

Sighing, Haruka picked up her camera, and walked over to Usagi, who 
already had hers loaded and ready, Derek standing by with extra film 
and lenses.

&#147;Now, don&#146;t look at the camera! Act like it&#146;s a normal day at the 
beach!&#148; Usagi called cheerfully, before running off to chase the 
regulars, leaving Michiru and Sarah to Haruka, as both hadn&#146;t moved 
from their places.

&#147;Michiru, just relax&#133;be yourself&#133;&#148; Haruka whispered to her, urging her 
with her eyes. Sarah moved in front of the shy girl, smiling 
seductively into the camera while posing in every way she could. 
Haruka stepped forward to reprimand the obnoxious girl but stopped as 
Michiru smiled reassuringly at her. Turning silently, she walked into 
the water, looking completely natural as she stretched, turned, and 
slid the gossy beach skirt off, letting it flutter into the water as 
Haruka followed her, snapping pictures rapidly. The blonde vaguely 
heard Lil behind her with her digital camera laughing softly while 
Mike stood beside her, trying hard to get the defiant Sarah to smile 
and ignore everyone else.

&#147;How am I doing Haruka?&#148; Michiru asked, drawing Haruka&#146;s attention to 
her eyes rather then her camera.

&#147;You&#146;re doing wonderful Michi&#133;absolutely wonderful&#133;&#148; the blonde 
smiled, snapping another two rolls of film before looking up again.

She was startled to see Michiru gazing at the spot they&#146;d been last 
night, obviously remembering the events, judging by the hurt in her 
eyes. Dropping her camera into its case by her feet, Haruka waded into 
the water, grasping Michiru&#146;s cold hands in her own.

&#147;I never meant to hurt you. Please&#133;please believe me? We&#146;ll be setting 
up camp at the fourth beach we visit today, have dinner with me? Let 
me make it up to you.&#148; The blonde pleaded, bringing Michiru&#146;s hands to 
her lips.

Michiru smiled softly, nodding her head before raising her face, 
leaning on tiptoe to give Haruka a quick kiss, fairly jumping back as 
a few catcalls and whistles could be heard from the shore.

&#147;Later&#148; Haruka whispered as she slowly released the woman in her arms 
bending down to get the beach skirt for her before turning to snap at 
everyone to get back to work.

Sighing again, Haruka realized it was going to be a VERY long day&#133;
