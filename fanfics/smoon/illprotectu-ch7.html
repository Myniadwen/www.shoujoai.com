<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Agent Kimimoto, where is General Satoshi&#39;s office again?&quot;

Minako asked her young bodyguard

&quot;His office is located near the Sunrise Bank beside the famous Blue 
Marlin Sushi bar, why did you ask Aino-san?&quot;

&quot;Oh&#151;I...because I think I have been in there before&quot; Reasoned Minako

&quot;Oh, I see&quot; Said Rinka

&#39;Yes, I definitely know the Blue Marlin, dad always treats me and mom 
there before I became a pop star&#39; Minako thoughtas she approaches Wendy

&quot;Wends, I need your help&quot; Whispered Minako

&quot;What is it Aino&quot; Asked Wendy curiously

&quot;Cover me up to the concert director&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Wendy hissed

&quot;Shhh, stay quiet! I&#39;ll be gone for just an hour&quot;

&quot;Are dreaming that I would just agree and let you go anywhere you wanted 
to?&quot; Said Wendy

&quot;Please Wendy, this will be the last, I promise!&quot; Pleaded the pop star

Wendy sighed

&quot;You&#39;re going to find her right?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot; Minako admitted, her eyes filled with emotions Wendy never had 
seen before

Wendy was silent. Then...

&quot;What about agent Rinka?&quot; Asked Wendy as she look at the young agent

&quot;I&#39;ll take her with me&quot; Minako said

&quot;...Just make sure nothing will happen bad to you Aino. I don&#39;t want to 
imagine that either so better be extra careful and stay beside agent 
Rinka&quot;

&quot;Oooh thank you so much Wends, I owe you so much!&quot; Minako then grabbed 
her duffle bag then approached to Rinka

&quot;Agent Kimimoto, I&#39;ll change my clothes in the dressing room, I kind of 
feeling sticky and sweaty already&quot;

&quot;Okay Aino-san, I&#39;m at your back&quot; Said Rinka

Minako and Rinka head towards the dressing room. As Minako finished 
changing her outfit, she got out of the dressing room

&quot;Aino-san, is that you? Why are you&#151;&quot;

&quot;Shh!&quot; Minako stopped Rinka from talking and grabbed her inside the 
dressing room

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Aino-san, but why are you dressed like that?&quot; Whispered Rinka

Minako is now wearing fit denims and simple pink printed blouse; her 
hair now has braids on each side, her teeth has retainers to make her 
unrecognizable. She&#39;s also wearing a cute cap and huge shades to hide 
her famous sparkling blue eyes

&quot;I&#39;m going to where Rei is, I&#39;ll come to get her in that General 
Satosho-shu-sha...whatever&#39;s office. Take these dress and change your 
outfit&quot; Explained the pop star as she hands Rinka another denims pants 
and yellow sleeveless blouse

&quot;But Aino-san, if I let you go out there, Rei-sama will surely be mad at 
me. She said she&#39;ll be back by afternoon right?&quot; Said Rinka

&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for her almost all this afternoon and she still isn&#39;t 
here. That&#39;s why I&#39;m coming for her&quot; Said Minako

&quot;Aino-san do you need something from Rei-sama? Maybe I could&#151;&quot;

&quot;Okay let&#39;s go!&quot; Said Minako as she exits the dressing room

&quot;B-but Aino-san&#151;w-wait&#151;I-I&#39;m still changing my dress...&quot; Hissed Rinka as 
she now enters the fitting area

------

As they got out...

&quot;Tell everybody that I&#39;m your friend who wanted to see Minako Aino in 
case they ask, okay?&quot; Whispered Minako to Rinka

Rinka sighed but followed Minako and her orders anyway

As Minako approaches at the sight of Wendy she saw her manager waving 
her cell phone, Minako knows what that means. It means call if anything 
bad happens, then Minako nodded and pats her pocket to tell Wendy she 
has her cell phone in there

Minako&#39;s heart is beating fast; no matter the all the doubts entering in 
her mind she must see Rei. She doesn&#39;t know why but she needed Rei by 
her side now

Good thing there are fewer agents around than yesterday, Minako and 
Rinka luckily passed through them towards the exit.

&quot;Agent Kimi...Can I just call you Rinka?&quot; Whispered Minako as they made 
their way through the first exit

&quot;Sure you can call me that. What is it?&quot; Asked the young agent

&quot;Rinka, aren&#39;t these men your fellow agents? It seems that they didn&#39;t 
recognize you&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s because I just started my training three weeks ago in the 
field, I always do my training in the headquarters&#39; office as a police 
assistant. That&#39;s why these men didn&#39;t know I&#39;m one of them&quot; Explained 
Rinka

&quot;Oh, I see that. And how did you meet Rei?&quot; Minako Said. Rinka giggled 
first then she continued

&quot;I really thought Rei-sama was a trainer like me back then, because I 
first saw her cleaning the head chief&#39;s office&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Said Minako

&quot;Uh-huh. But I discovered I was wrong when she helped me at my paper 
files that I&#39;ve been trying to finish for three months, she easily 
finished it for me in one week&quot; Said Rinka as they finally passed the 
last exit.

Minako didn&#39;t notice that she&#39;s now acting naturally and she wasn&#39;t 
nervous at all because she was listening to the young agent

&quot;And the head chief always includes her in dangerous missions. That&#39;s 
when I started to be inspired by her&quot; Said Rinka with determination in 
her voice

Then suddenly a voice called them

&quot;Hey there!&quot; The security guard said as he approaches Minako and Rinka

Minako&#39;s heart stopped. Did that man recognized her?

Rinka bravely turned to the security guard

&quot;Yes, can we help you sir?&quot; Asked Rinka with slight nervousness on her 
voice

Minako turned to the guard so that he won&#39;t get suspicious

&quot;Is this picture of Minako Aino yours? You may have probably dropped it 
by accident&quot; Asked the guard as he shows a wallet size picture of Minako

Minako decided to act

&quot;Oooh why yes mister! That is definitely mine; I&#39;ve been looking for it 
all over this place! Now that you found it I can finally go home, thank 
you mister kind stranger!&quot; Said Minako as she grabbed the picture from 
the man

&quot;You&#39;re welcome girls!&quot; Said the kind security guard as he waves goodbye 
to Rinka and Minako

Then they both sighed as they went out at the Visitor&#39;s gate of the 
studio

&quot;Wow Aino-san, you should have taken acting&quot; Whispered Rinka

&quot;That&#39;s a hidden talent&quot; Minako said as she winked at the young agent

&quot;While we are in the streets, call me Rui okay?&quot; Said Minako

&quot;Okay Rui-san&quot; Confirmed Rinka

Then they called a taxi to take them to where the general&#39;s meeting is 
being held

&quot;Where are we going young ladies?&quot; Asked the old driver

&quot;To the Blue Marlin Restaurant&quot; Said Rinka

Then the driver started to move his car to take them to that place

&quot;Uh, Rinka, did you exactly know where the general&#39;s office is?&quot; Asked 
Minako

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been there a year ago, so I definitely should remember it 
when we get there&quot; Said Rinka

-----

-General Satoshi&#39;s office-

&#39;Finally the meeting&#39;s finished. I felt like I&#39;m going to die from 
boredom in there!&#39; Rei thought as she walks towards the exit

&quot;Hino-san&quot; A voice called her then she turned

&quot;General Satoshi, sir&quot; Rei saluted as the head chief and the general 
approached her

&quot;Good job with the report, all who attended the meeting said they 
understood your report because your voice is clear and whole&quot; General 
Satoshi said

&quot;Thank you very much for the praise general sir&quot; Rei said as she bows

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be going. I have lots of paper works to finish. Take care 
both of you&quot; Said the general as he went back to his office

The head chief turned to Rei then patted her head

&quot;Good job Hino!&quot; The head chief said proudly. Rei pushed his hand away 
from her head

&quot;Hey your hand&#39;s heavy, are you going to crush your niece&#39;s head?&quot; Joked 
Rei

The head chief looked at Rei deeply, which annoyed the raven-haired girl

&quot;Why are you looking at me like that?&quot; Asked Rei

The head chief chuckled

&quot;Nothing. It&#39;s just I never realized you&#39;re almost as tall as I do, 
you&#39;re just one and a half inch shorter&quot; Said the head chief then he 
continued

&quot;The more you grow up, the more you looked like your father. But your 
eyes, voice and lips came from your beautiful mother&quot;

Rei smiled

&quot;Big bo&#151;er&#151;uncle Namada, why didn&#39;t you have your own family like dad?&quot; 
Rei felt it was a good time to ask

The head chief was silent

&quot;Y-you don&#39;t have to answer that, I&#39;m sorry&#151;I&quot;

&quot;No. I think this is the right time to tell you the truth&quot; The head 
chief said as he sighed and then he sat in the couch near him

Rei followed and sat beside him then listened

&quot;It all started with a woman. She&#39;s a singer back then&#151;&quot;

&quot;Just like mom?&quot; Rei cut in

The head chief just smiled

&quot;Your father was a political adviser, and I was an agent in training 
that time. I first saw her in a politic press conference where I was 
assigned. She was the representative and speaker of the campaign against 
your father&#39;s client politician&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh, then what happened next?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;A week after the press conference, I bumped into her at a Chinese 
restaurant. That was the day I finally met and know her&quot; Replied the 
head chief

&quot;Then after that, we almost see each other daily and eat at that 
restaurant because she usually eats there. She&#39;s the most beautiful 
woman I ever saw yet back then&quot; He continued

&quot;Oh really? Who&#39;s the most beautiful woman you recently saw now?&quot; Rei 
asked teasingly

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later&quot; The head chief winked

&quot;Then when your father arrived from a meeting in Singapore, I asked him 
to drop by at the restaurant to meet her. When they finally met, they 
recognized each other at once. But they didn&#39;t argue. Because she fully 
understands that your father was just doing his job&quot;

&quot;Wow dad already went to Singapore?&quot; Rei asked in disbelief. The head 
chief nodded

&quot;After the day they met each other, it was like the day I regret that I 
let your father meet her&quot; The head chief said as he frowns

Rei noticed him and she frowned too. Is that...?

&quot;They had started seeing each other often and eats in a different 
restaurant. I like her...no, I love her. But she doesn&#39;t feel the same 
for me. She loves your father, and I know that I cannot force her to 
love me&quot; Said the head chief

&quot;Uncle...Namada...&quot;

&quot;But instead of feeling deep hatred to both of them, I didn&#39;t know why 
but I couldn&#39;t and would never ever hate them. I love your father 
because he&#39;s the best brother in the world for me. I love her because 
she cares about me and what I do&quot;

The head chief smiled as he recalled his brother&#39;s marriage from his 
memories

&quot;I cannot take to hate them...because they love each other in the bottom 
of their hearts with pure sincerity. My brother loves her more than 
anything and she feels the same for him. And I love her, and I want her 
to be happy...so I let her go. She will always be the first and the last 
woman I&#39;ll ever love&quot;

&quot;Big boss...You love my mom and dad so much that you unselfishly gave up 
your happiness for theirs?&quot; Rei said

&quot;And I never regretted that decision. A year after they got married, you 
were finally born. The most beautiful child I ever saw&quot; Said the head 
chief as he looked at Rei who smiled and blushed at the same time

&quot;And now that you are here at my guidance, I promised my brother that I 
will take care of you just like your grandfather did to you when he was 
alive. And I am inspired by you everyday because every time I see you, 
you always remind me of the most important persons to me&quot; The head chief 
said as he pats Rei&#39;s left cheek lightly

&quot;Your gentle attitude and strong personality, reminds me of your wise 
father. Your bluish lavender eyes and crimson lips remind me of your 
beautiful mother. And your bravery? Of course it reminds me of myself 
when I was young!&quot; Joked the head chief then his face straightened

&quot;And now those features made you the most beautiful woman I ever saw&quot; He 
finally said

&quot;Oh, Big boss!&quot; Rei gave her uncle a bear hug

&quot;But of course, Aino-san is tied up with your beauty for me&quot; He 
commented. Rei rolled her eyes

&quot;Naughty as usual&quot; She said. Then suddenly the head chief&#39;s cell phone 
rang

&quot;I&#39;ll call you later, Hino&quot; He said as he answered the phone and walked 
back to the hall of the general&#39;s office

&quot;Thanks for sharing your life, big boss&quot; Rei whispered then finally went 
outside the door

As Rei walk outside the building she saw a record bar two buildings away 
at the other side of the road

&#39;A record bar! Now is the best time to buy those&#39; She thought

-----

-At the streets of Tokyo-

Minako and Rinka walked at the busy streets of Tokyo, trying to find a 
familiar Bank near a Sushi restaurant

&quot;I can&#39;t understand, the Blue Marlin is supposed to be beside the 
Sunrise Bank, but there isn&#39;t any Sunrise Bank in here&quot; Said a confused 
Rinka

&quot;But the Blue Marlin is here, aren&#39;t you suppose to be familiar to where 
the general&#39;s office is when you see this restaurant?&quot; Asked Minako

&quot;Oh, I really can&#39;t remember! I&#39;m really-really sorry Ain&#151;I mean 
Rui-san!&quot; Said Rinka as she slapped her hand on her head and bows 
apologetically

Minako just sighed and sweat dropped

&quot;It&#39;s alright; we&#39;ll just walk or ask someone and read all the sign 
boards that could possibly become a hint to the general&#39;s office&quot; Minako 
said as they continue to walk

After asking some people they suddenly passed an appliance shop with 
different television sizes and models are displayed inside the glass 
window. The biggest of them all has been showing the commercial 
endorsement of Minako&#39;s upcoming concert. This caught Rinka&#39;s attention

&quot;Rui-san, look at this. It&#39;s your&#151;I mean Minako&#39;s concert is being 
endorsed at channel six!&quot; Rinka said as she was completely taken over by 
the television. Minako sighed

&#39;Rinka is still young indeed, she still adores television&#39; She smiled in 
that thought. Then she looked at the other side of the road, she saw a 
building with a small gold plate placed near the entrance door of it

She tried to read the golden plate&#39;s silver encryption. Her heart 
stopped. She is not sure but she thinks she read a &#39;Satoshi&#39; in that 
golden plate. She may have mistaken, but she has to confirm if she&#39;s 
right or not. There&#39;s no harm on trying right?

She turned to Rinka. She noticed that the young bodyguard had been 
completely taken over by the television

&quot;Uh...Rinka? I&#39;ll cross over the road to look at the encryption of the 
golden plate in that building. Is that okay with you? ...Rinka?&quot;

Rinka is now hypnotized and wasn&#39;t responding. Minako sweat dropped 
again

&quot;Okay, I guess I have to check it myself. You wait here okay?&quot; She said 
as she left Rinka and crosses the road

-----

-Record Shop-

Rei approaches the counter as she excitedly carries three CDs that she 
was going to purchase

As she approaches the counter she hands out the CDs to the cashier. The 
cashier looked at her and then looked at the CDs she&#39;s buying. And 
finally she let out an uncontrolled giggle that annoyed Rei

&quot;What? Is there anything funny in my face?&quot; She said heatedly

&quot;No, nothing. I&#39;m sorry about that. I just never thought that a even 
policewoman like you appreciate this kind of albums&quot; The counter said

Rei looked at what she&#39;s wearing. She&#39;s wearing her police uniform and 
even the hat! She can&#39;t blame herself; they are required to wear proper 
uniform especially at meetings!

She paid for the CDs and the bagger wrapped it in a plastic and gave it 
back to her. As she leads her way to the glass door exit, she saw a 
familiar blonde crossing the street, wearing a cap, hair braided on each 
side. Only one person has that slim but perfectly shaped legs and walks 
that graceful even when her back is turned: Minako.

What? Minako? What the hell is she doing there?

As Rei confirmed it was really Minako, she ran out of the exit door and 
ran back to the building of the general&#39;s office where Minako is 
standing in front of the entrance door

Minako is now at the front of the building entrance. Now she can finally 
read what words were encrypted in the golden plate. It says:

General Hondura Satoshi IIX Building

Minako wanted to shout and cry for joy

&quot;At last I found where Rei-chan is&quot; She said as she caress the golden 
plate

Then the security guard of the building noticed her

&quot;Is there anything I can do for you, young lady?&quot; He asked

&quot;I&#151;I---well...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright, I know her&quot; Minako was cut of by a voice behind her

She turned as she hears the familiar voice she has been dying to hear 
again

&quot;Rei-chan!&quot; Minako ran and hugged Rei tightly around her waist

Suddenly it began to rain heavily. Both of them are now soaking wet 
under the rain. The guard tried to offer them an umbrella but he was 
ignored so he gave up

&quot;What are you doing in here? Didn&#39;t you know the risks if the people 
around here recognizes you?&quot; Rei hissed as she whispers to Minako, but 
the pop star is still hugging her

Rei softened as she felt Minako&#39;s hug warmth her

&quot;Rei-chan, what took you so long? You promised you&#39;ll be back as soon as 
you can right?&quot; Minako said as her face is still buried on Rei&#39;s chest 
making her voice blur</pre>
