<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 16 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>&#147; Listen Jimmy! I told you this already! Don&#146;t bring out the swimsuits 
until I find a new model first. After that prissy brat Linda quit&#133;&#148; 
Johnny Smith stopped speaking into his Motorola cell phone as his 
black limo shook suddenly. He rolled down the window to the cab.

&#147; Benson what happened&#133;&#148; The forty year old looked into the cab to see 
the window shield shattered and his driver unconscious. On the hood 
was a white&#133;something or other. Johnny climbed out of the dented 
limacine and walked around to the front. He brought a manicured hand 
to his mouth as he gasped and gaped at the white thing atop the limo. 
A young woman had crashed on his limo in a now blood soaked wedding 
gown.

&#147; My God!&#148; He flipped his cell phone open and quickly dialed a number.

&#147; 911? Yes, a young woman just landed on my limo and my driver is 
unconscious&#133;&#133;fourth and fifth&#133;right.&#148; Pressing the end button the 
Motorola beeped and he took a closer look at the girl. She was pretty, 
no gorgeous.

- Well, I just found my model.-

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

&#147; Ami! Can we leave yet?!&#148; Rei paced back and forth impatiently.

&#147; No Rei! The spot has to calm first! Soon though.&#148; Rei growled and 
stalked off. Hotaru sighed and laid back onto the empty pew cushions.

&#147; I feel so horrible for her. This must be frustrating. Why did Terri 
have to be so noble?&#148; Setsuna smiled at the Saturn princess. 

&#147; Because within her is the power to keep everyone safe, no matter how 
she must do it. Terri has chosen her fate just like the rest of us. 
None of us had to be a Senshi, if we had wished, the power would have 
searched for another. Rei will get her back, don&#146;t worry firefly.&#148; 
Hotaru&#146;s eyes watered a bit.

&#147; Rei and Ami get to search for her while the rest of us must wait and 
wonder if they&#146;ll come back alive or if she&#146;s already dead! Sometimes 
you are wrong though Setsuna mama, I never had the choice. The spirit 
of my past self and Saturn found me. I don&#146;t think Terri or Serena had 
the choice either. With the power held within them, no one else could 
have held it and not been consumed. Think about it, Terri was born 
with a planet. Who else could hold that responsibility?&#148; Setsuna 
smiled down at the girl.

&#147; Hotaru you grow smarter every day. Your correct, you three really 
couldn&#146;t have chosen your destiny. Darien had always been meant do die 
the way he did and Rini was to be born with pink hair. Destiny though 
can only claim a part of you firefly. &#147; Hotaru giggled as she 
remembered Rini&#146;s soft pink hair. Rei had stormed back into the 
chapel. Staring venomously at the spot that had sucked her true love 
away from her. Rei broke down then, her legs shook as she fell do the 
floor. Crystal tears streaked her pretty face. Anger and fear 
caressing her cheeks. In fury she pounded the ground as Serena tried 
to get her to stop.

&#147; Oh Rei! Please stop, your not going to get Terri back by ruining the 
chapel. Save it for the bad guys.&#148; The raven haired woman turned her 
head to look at her best friend.

&#147; Why? Why did Terri have to save us all? She left me again, for the 
third damn time! When can we have peace and rule our lives the way we 
wish? I hate this, I hate the way we all suffer!&#148; Rei cried into her 
hands as Serena hugged her close. The others looked on sorrowfully at 
the scene.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

&#147; Mr. Smith? You are the man who brought in the young girl yesterday, 
am I correct?&#148; The red haired man stood from his seat. 

&#147; Yes, is she doing well?&#148; 

&#147; Yes. We&#146;ve placed her in a private room at your request.&#148; They 
walked through the white walled hallways and through the colorful 
children&#146;s ward. Thus bringing them into another care unit of the 
hospital through tall dark blue doors. Through a light green door and 
behind a curtain was the young woman that had smashed onto Johnny&#146;s 
limo. A middle aged nurse finished what she was doing and turned to 
the doctor. 

&#147; Her pulse has remained steady Doctor Jhiles.&#148; The tall dark doctor 
smiled at her and she exited the room. 

&#147; Amazingly she isn&#146;t that bad off.&#148; The Dr. Jhiles held a small bit 
of shock in his eyes as he continued he looked over the young woman&#146;s 
chart.

&#147; Her ankle is sprained, there are two deep gashes on her arms from 
glass shards, and everything else is bruises and scratches. Most of 
which have healed miraculously fast. Her face had many more cuts than 
it did now. I&#146;ve examined her blood and there was nothing irregular. 
She&#146;s just a very fast healer I suppose. Though she hasn&#146;t waken up 
yet. &#147; Smith nodded, very pleased with the girl.

&#147; Did the police find anything on her?&#148; 

&#147; No unfortunately. They&#146;ve dubbed her Jane Doe. We&#146;re hoping that 
when she wakes she&#146;ll know. We can place her into your care, that is, 
if she is under eighteen.&#148;

&#147; Thank you. I already have my secretary setting up her room.&#148; At that 
moment her eyelids fluttered open, revealing deep navy blue orbs. 

&#147; Oh my&#133;sleeping beauty finally awakes. Glad you came back to the 
living Miss.&#148; With clouded vision she looked over at them, her eyes 
focusing on the two men. 

&#147; Where am I?&#148; The doctor stepped over to take her pulse. 

&#147; In Los Angeles Memorial Hospital. Mr. Smith here brought you here 
after you crash landed onto his limo. Do you happen to know your name 
Miss?&#148; her eyes closed for a minute. They opened again and she shook 
her white and chestnut locks. 

&#147; I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s all blank.&#148; Both men sighed a bit and smiled at her 
warmly.

&#147; It&#146;s alright dear. We can figure out your age by taking some X-rays. 
I&#146;m going to go get a wheel chair for you. Mr. Smith would like to 
speak with you anyways.&#148; Dr. Jhiles left, leaving Her and the older 
man alone. Johnny smiled at her and she looked at him a bit nervously.

&#147; Hello Miss, I&#146;m Johnny Smith. First of all I suppose you need a 
name. Mind if I pick one out for you?&#148; She shook her head.

&#147; No, I don&#146;t mind.&#148;

&#147; Well then, how about Jena Smith?&#148; She quirked an eyebrow at him. 

&#147; Your last name?&#148; 

&#147; Well you see I&#146;ve come with a proposition. Since you have amnesia 
you will need housing and a job. I hold both for you Miss.&#148; She looked 
skeptical.

&#147; What type of job?&#148; 

&#147; Modeling. Your absolutely perfect. What do you say?&#148; Johnny looked 
at her as she thought of the idea. Then she smiled and handed out her 
hand. 

&#147; I don&#146;t believe we&#146;ve been properly introduced Mr. Smith, I&#146;m Jena.&#148; 
He chuckled and shook her tan hand.
