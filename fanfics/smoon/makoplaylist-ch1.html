fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chakeroo.html">chakeroo</a><br> </h2>
<p class="p1">“No… wait… what?!” Makoto shouted then looks at the raven haired girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I asked if you actually asked her out on a date yet.” Rei said grinning.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“W..why… do you think that… I’d… you know…ask her?” Makoto stuttering and 
gradually blushing. She was playing with the spoon on her right hand and slightly moving 
the cake on the side.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s <i>soooooo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> obvious that 
you like her Mako chan.” Rei answered then took a sip of her soda. “And everybody knows 
that you like her, even Usagi.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Everybody?” shouted Makoto and Rei coughed out the soda she was sipping. 
Almost all of the other customers turned around and looked at her. “Sorry…” addressing the 
people and Rei.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto moved nearer to Rei and whispered, “Everybody?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well almost everybody…” answered Rei while wiping her chin with a 
tissue.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Huh? You said everybody. Who else doesn’t know about <i>it</i>?” Makoto puts 
her hand on Rei’s shoulders and starts shaking her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The miko lets out a sigh and points outside.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Oh Kami no… It’s not… No… Shit… Kami… she’s so cute wearing that uniform… 
Stop thinking that!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> thought Makoto as a 
blond girl with a red bow talks outside with some of the boys that walked up to her. 
<i>Shut up! Shut up! Stop talking to her you baka! They’re so pathetic, flirting with her 
like that.</i> Makoto made a face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto’s face turned red, not because she was blushing, because she was 
getting really jealous and angry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To ease her 
anger, she popped her earphones to her ear and pushed play. A familiar song began…</p>
<p class="p3">… Invitation only, grand farewells<br>
Crash the best one, of the best ones<br>
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed, too early to say goodnight<br>
<br>
You have stolen my heart<br>
<br>
And from the ballroom floor we are in celebration<br>
One good stretch before our hibernation<br>
Our dreams assured and we all, will sleep well<br>
<br>
You have stolen<br>
You have stolen my heart<br>
<br>
I watch you spin around in your highest heels<br>
You are the best one, of the best ones<br>
We all look like we feel<br>
<br>
You have stolen my<br>
You have stolen my heart…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>This is torture. Well only to me and besides its working. It makes me sad 
but at least I can control what I’m feeling after. You’re so emo Makoto! </i>Thought Makoto 
as she was staring at Minako through the window.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei was smirking and an imaginary devil horns grew through her hair. An idea 
popped in her head and she would need accomplices to make this work.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ehem…” Rei coughed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">No answer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“EHEM!” Rei repeated now slamming the table a little bit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto was startled. She got up and shouted, “WHAT?!?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The people started staring again. They looked at Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei pointed out to Makoto’s ear. Makoto realized that she was still listening 
full blast at the song, she took off the earphones, sat again and looked at Rei.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So she <i>stole</i> your heart, what you gonna do about it?” Rei was 
chuckling then she pointed outside to the blonde that was walking nearer to the entrance of 
the Crown.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Shit! You heard that? Was the volume that loud?” Makoto blushed then faced 
palm herself.</p>
<p class="p1">As Rei was nodding, Minako walked over to their seats.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hi guys!!!” Minako cheerfully greeted the two.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto slid her iPod under the table and was having a hard time turning off 
the gadget. As she finally turned it off, she sighed with relief. She looked at Rei, who 
was smirking and signaled to the left with her eyes, and then she looked to the left and 
Minako was looking at her quizzically. Makoto blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What’s the matter my Makochan?” asked the blond.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Did she just say my Mako? Oh shush it Makoto. She would never call you 
that. That eyes… Those red… red… lips… Stop it. Control yourself!</i> Makoto thought and 
her heartbeat became faster and her face redder. “N..n..nothing.” she stuttered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you sure? You don’t seem fine. Scoot over dear…” Minako pushed Makoto 
more over to the window side. “Ooooh… strawberry shortcake!” and got the spoon from Makoto 
and ate the cake.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto’s head was still down, she seemed paralyzed and she was still 
blushing… a lot.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Those boys are funny. They had to be in a group just to approach me. Ha-ha.” 
Minako said still eating the cake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Two of them 
asked me if I could go out for a date tomorrow and I said I don’t know. They almost fought 
each other.” She was smiling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t you like at least one of them?” Asked the miko, then she looked at 
Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nah… I really don’t like those types of guys.” Licking the spoon of the last 
crumbs of the cake.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If you’re that picky, you won’t have a date on Valentine’s.” Rei said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You know <i>that</i> won’t be a problem. Besides it’s couple weeks away 
anyway.” Answering Rei confidently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While they were talking, a part of the song kept playing on Makoto’s 
head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">… Invitation only, grand farewells<br>
Crash the best one, of the best ones<br>
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed, too early to say goodnight…</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Right….</i>” Rei rolling her eyes then she kicked Makoto’s shin under the 
table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then suddenly Makoto stood up excused herself and ran outside the Crown.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What the hell is wrong with that girl?!” Minako asked Rei, irritated.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know. Ask her yourself.” Rei smiling evilly and then she remembered 
something, “Oh we got to get going or will be late for our study group.” Rei stood up.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh right.” Answered Minako and went with the miko.</p>
