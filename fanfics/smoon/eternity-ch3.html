<h1>Eternity (part 3 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saun.html">Saun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/eternity-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The next morning saw the couple hurriedly packing all of their wedding 
clothes to meet Setsuna and Hotaru at the wedding site. The chapel they 
had chosen was small and tucked in the heart of a nearby harbor. Rows of 
white chairs sat to either side of a blue carpet running up the aisle. 
Its huge glass windows were so clear they were almost transparent and 
the vibrant blue ocean was very visible through the crystal panes. It 
was the next best thing to being actually on the beach. They wouldn&#39;t 
have to be concerned about the elements and also the music would be 
easily heard over the muted roaring of the waves.

As luck would have it the day was sunny and bright with a nearly 
cloudless sky. The curator greeted them and opened the doors when they 
pulled up to the chapel. As Haruka handed Michiru her make-up kit from 
the car, the violinist took a deep lung-full of the salty air and sighed 
contentedly.

Another car pulled up.

&quot;What are you doing! You aren&#39;t supposed to see each other before the 
wedding!&quot; Setsuna raised her sunglasses to arch an eyebrow at Haruka.

&quot;You wanted me to make Michiru walk?&quot; Haruka feigned shock.

Her lover made a disapproving sound. Hotaru just shook her head as she 
retrieved two bags from the back seat.

The garnet eyed time guardian took charge of Michiru&#39;s large dress bag 
and together the three members of the bridal party disappeared into the 
room designated as their base of operations.

The blonde was still outside when the florist arrived and she showed 
them into the sanctuary and let them get to work. One of the women 
handed her a large box containing the bridal flowers. Haruka went over 
and knocked sharply on the door to the bride&#39;s changing room.

&quot;Delivery!&quot; she called.

There was a rustling noise. &quot;Close your eyes,&quot; came the demand.

Obediently the blonde closed her eyes. The door swung open and she was 
divested of her charge. As the door swung shut she could have sworn she 
heard Michiru call out to her but it was suddenly muffled. Shaking her 
head in amusement the blonde went to change.

An hour later Setsuna was putting a coat of gloss over her lipstick 
while Hotaru fussed with her hair. It was a little longer than the 
pageboy cut of her youth, but it was still hard to get the straight 
black strands to cooperate in any kind of styling endeavors. They were 
both already dressed in long flowing gowns of marine blue, Michiru&#39;s 
favorite color. In their arms they would cradle long stemmed lilies 
while the bride carried a bouquet of stephanotis and white roses.

Michiru was radiant in white silk. She had begun to think this day would 
never come. While she had secretly dreamed of a wedding for herself, 
this wonderful reality was still a fantastic surprise for her. All of 
those details tucked away in her heart of hearts had been made into 
reality. She watched her best friend and daughter with a smile on her 
face. Around their necks were the identical pendants Michiru had given 
the two women she treasured. Setsuna and Hotaru had helped with as many 
details as they could and their presence alone added tremendously to her 
joy on this wonderful day.

Setsuna brushed invisible lint off of her skirt and rechecked her 
appearance, looking uncustomarily nervous.

&quot;If you don&#39;t quit that, I&#39;ll have to do your makeup again,&quot; Michiru 
teased. Setsuna grimaced at the cosmetics queen.

Their dark haired daughter was looking out the blinds.

&quot;Wow, a lot of people are here already,&quot; she commented. Immediately, the 
bride and her best friend were at the window.

&quot;Michiru-mama! They can&#39;t see you yet.&quot; Hotaru tried to tug her back.

&quot;Shh. They won&#39;t!&quot; Setsuna whispered. She was curious too.

The dress code had been listed as a summer dressy casual. The men looked 
great in their khakis and polo shirts while the women wore flowing 
summer dresses with wide brimmed hats.

&quot;Wow look at Ami-chan,&quot; the violet eyed woman breathed.

Setsuna looked over her with a practiced eye. &quot;Good style and color 
choice.&quot;

&quot;Pinch me,&quot; a voice said softly.

&quot;Nani?&quot; Hotaru glanced out of the corner of her eye at Michiru.

The aqua haired woman looked amused. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m dreaming!&quot;

Setsuna looped her arm through Michiru&#39;s clasping her hand.

&quot;Are you nervous?&quot; the time guardian asked.

Michiru shook her head. &quot;Not at all. In fact, I feel...&quot;

&quot;Hey! There&#39;s two limos. Chibi Usa-chan!&quot; Hotaru was excited to see her 
best friend.

The other two occupants of the room looked back to the window to watch 
the King, Queen, and Princess.

Inside the chapel Haruka was calmly awaiting the arrival of the Royal 
family as Endymion and Serenity were performing the civil ceremony. She 
had already greeted the musicians who had taken their places on the 
raised dais.

The blonde was suddenly swarmed by several young women.

Haruka looked dashing in a sand-colored suit and open necked white 
shirt.

&quot;Kakkoi!&quot; Minako shouted grabbing the blonde&#39;s arm. &quot;I guess now 
Haruka-san is officially off the market!&quot;

&quot;Minako-chan.&quot; Makoto shook her head and smiled knowingly. &quot;Haruka-san 
was already off the market on the first day we met her.&quot;

The sandy blonde leaned in and gave Minako a sisterly kiss of the cheek. 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you still have a chance.&quot; She winked at the other girl.

Minako didn&#39;t look impressed. &quot;Of a snowball in he-...&quot;

Makoto elbowed her.

Haruka crossed her arms across her chest. &quot;Hey, I never said it was a 
good chance.&quot;

&quot;Haruka-san!&quot; The queen in a lovely pink and white sundress accosted her 
blonde protector. Haruka returned the hug affectionately. Behind 
Serenity strolled Endymion.

&quot;How do I look?&quot; The king was not in his customary lavender, but rather 
a nicely tailored dark blue suit. He was tinkering with a stubborn 
cufflink.

&quot;You clean up pretty well,&quot; the senshi of the wind teased as the two 
shook hands. The three moved to the back of the chapel where they would 
await their cue to enter.

More and more guests filed in to take their seats and a low murmur 
filled the chapel as they began to talk amongst themselves.

The blonde was taking deep breaths to calm herself. She flexed her hands 
slightly. Beside her the king and queen exchanged amused glances, but 
Haruka was oblivious to everything except her growing nervousness. She 
was irritated with herself as well; she&#39;d never been anxious - not even 
before a race.

&quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; a retainer said. The three took their places at the front 
of the chapel. The guests instantly hushed and a quiet air of 
expectation fell over the room.

The music started as a very gentle tune and the bridesmaids came down 
the aisle. Hotaru was first, her joy at being part of this special day 
for her parents obvious. Setsuna followed with a kind smile for Haruka 
who stood alone. The blonde didn&#39;t have a best man, although a few 
nights ago she and Makoto had gone out for drinks in lieu of a 
Bachlorette party.

No one really noticed as the slight senshi of destruction went up and 
joined the small orchestra. A hush fell over the room as they awaited 
the arrival of the bride. Hotaru picked up her violin and with a 
well-practiced sweep of her arm began to play a rich melody. The pianist 
joined and the duet created was quite different from the wedding march 
of old, but seemingly appropriate. All of the guests rose and stood with 
respectful attention as Michiru made her entrance. Breath-takingly 
beautiful, she calmly glided down the aisle with her skirt billowing at 
her feet like gentle waves.

Her hair was down and pinned back on one side with an orchid above her 
ear. In her arms was bouquet of white roses and Stephanotis. Each little 
flower carried a pearl in the center as it had been crafted by a master 
florist. When she reached Haruka, the blonde bowed slightly and offered 
her arm. Michiru took it beaming at her fianc&eacute;e. Setsuna quickly took 
charge of Michiru&#39;s bouquet and handed it to Hotaru, who had rejoined 
her, before fluffing out Michiru&#39;s short train.

Michiru knew she was blushing. She was so happy she thought her heart 
would burst. She looked at Haruka and found the blonde watching her. 
When their eyes met it was like an electrical shock went through them 
both.

King Endymion greeted the guest and made his statement.

----------

&quot;It has been said that it is love that makes the world go around. 
However, without a doubt, it is friendship which keeps our spinning 
existence on an even keel.

True friendship provides so many of the essentials for happiness in life 
- it is the foundation on which to build an enduring relationship. It is 
the music which bonds us all together in harmony, and it is the calm, 
warm protection that we sometimes need when the world outside seems 
unstable and chaotic. True friendship holds up a mirror to our faults 
but embraces us in spite of them. True friendship nurtures our hopes, 
supports us in disappointment and encourages us to grow into our fullest 
potential. A long time ago Haruka and Michiru came together as friends, 
but it was a friendship so strong and deeply devoted that it became a 
powerful love. Today before these assembled witnesses they will pledge 
their eternal commitment to each other and in making these vows will 
cement their marriage before the Crown.&quot;

Serenity smiled and took over. &quot;A successful marriage requires falling 
in love many times, always with the same person...&quot; she smiled a 
secretive smile. &quot;...May your marriage always be a safe haven in the 
world. A place of love and peace. Haruka, Michiru, your vows.&quot;

Haruka was nervous and when she started to speak her vow for a moment 
the world contracted to a point and then burst back into marvelous 
technicolor focus. She swayed slightly holding Michiru&#39;s hands in her 
own. &#145;Baka&#39; she shouted to herself. &#145;Don&#39;t faint!&#39; She&#39;d done this 
before.. well she&#39;d done the love contest. But that had been a game to 
her then, this was wonderfully real. From this day the state would 
recognize Michiru as her legal wife and no one could take that from 
them. A strong and confident voice she almost didn&#39;t recognize as her 
own began to speak the wedding vow they had chosen.

&quot;I, Tenoh Haruka, take you Kaioh Michiru to be my wife, my partner and 
one true love. I will cherish our union and will strive to love you more 
each day than I did the day before. I will trust and respect you, love 
you faithfully through good times and bad, regardless of what obstacles 
we may face together. I vow to give you my hand, my heart, my soul and 
my love, from this day forward into eternity.&quot;

Michiru sniffled a bit and squeezed Haruka&#39;s hands before repeating her 
own vow in a strong clear voice.

----------

&quot;I, Kaioh Michiru, take you Tenoh Haruka to be my wife, my partner and 
one true love...&quot;

Under Endymion&#39;s direction they exchanged rings that were platinum bands 
with a thin river of gold through the center. They complimented 
Michiru&#39;s engagement ring while incorporating Haruka&#39;s favorite color. 
Haruka took great care placing the ring on Michiru&#39;s slender finger. The 
hand she knew so well. Michiru&#39;s hands were sure as she slid the ring 
home on Haruka&#39;s finger.

&quot;Under the power vested in us as the rulers of Crystal Tokyo and all of 
her inhabitants we hereby pronounce you two, one in the eyes of the 
Crown.&quot; There was a bright flash from the crystals and Haruka felt the 
warmth of their embracing power surge through her. The newly married 
couple paused for a second smiling at one another. Then Michiru reached 
up and cupped Haruka&#39;s cheek before moving in to tenderly kiss the 
blonde.

The crowd broke into applause for the newlyweds, rising to their feet.

Although time for the recessional, Haruka caught Michiru&#39;s hand and 
pulled it back against the blonde&#39;s own chest over her heart, just as 
the violinist turned for them to leave. Haruka took a deep breath. She 
needed to say this, needed to let Michiru and all of these guests know 
how much her wife meant to her. Surprised blue eyes looked up into her 
own.

&quot;Michiru... when we first met. I was always running, but you always 
found me. ...I was the soldier of battle and you ...you were the soldier 
of smiles ...with the sea in her eyes. You always knew my true feelings 
even when I tried to hide them from others. I know that before I could 
never bring myself to say to you in front of the world...aishiteru. But 
I&#39;m through running.&quot; Her voice had dropped an octave as her tightly 
caged emotions surged to the surface. &quot;My heart is full...&quot; the blonde 
whispered. &quot;Aishiteru.&quot;

Michiru gave a soft gasp as she heard the word that Haruka rarely said, 
but she always knew burned brightly in the blonde&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Haruka.&quot; The violinist repeated her wife&#39;s name rawly, her voice choked 
with emotion.

Haruka&#39;s right hand was tangled with Michiru&#39;s left and they leaned in 
at the exact same moment and found each other&#39;s lips.

Off to the right Setsuna looked down and wiped away a few tears.

When the couple turned to walk out, the guests burst into applause. The 
blonde ducked her head and flushed slightly as she acknowledged her 
vulnerability, but Michiru was her strength. After Haruka&#39;s wildly 
romantic speech there was barely a dry eye in the house. The queen was 
weeping tears of joy and the king had his arm around his wife, but was 
positively beaming for his friends.

Preparing for the reception after the formal pictures, Michiru slipped 
off her silk dress and turned to see exactly what Haruka intended to 
wear.

&quot;Oh.&quot; The comment was soft because all the air had left Michiru&#39;s lungs 
the second she&#39;d set eyes on her gorgeous mate.

The blonde smiled with a mischievous sparkle in her verdant eyes. She 
was positively radiant.

Michiru concentrated and was soon similarly attired.

The Princess of Uranus offered her arm to her new bride.

The aqua haired woman laughed. &quot;You don&#39;t intend to take it easy on them 
do you?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Her wife answered in a low happy voice. She was going to 
have a lot of fun with this.

In the palace ballroom everyone was waiting for the newly married 
couple&#39;s appearance. When they swept down the huge, elegantly decorated 
staircase a soft gasp rose up from the crowd. Together the newlyweds 
made a striking but beautiful contrast with Uranus&#39; royal blue gown and 
its ornate straps set off by Neptune&#39;s aqua gown full of gentle 
wave-like gathers.

The cutting of the cake was a fun ceremony as they held the knife 
together. Uranus grinned for a moment as the knife sliced through the 
icing.

&quot;Space Sword...&quot;

Neptune elbowed her lightly although she looked amused.

The other senshi in attendance laughed. King Endymion looking the most 
entertained. It was good to see them both so free and open. Only rarely 
would anyone see Uranus&#39; playful side but after the ceremony she was on 
a kind of high from the release of the tension.

They fed each other cake. Staring into each other&#39;s eyes as they tasted 
small forkfuls of the elegant dessert.

There were several toasts to the new couple. One of them by a certain 
short palace retainer was funny and sent a few gentle barbs in Uranus&#39; 
direction. The blonde slunk in her seat and brought her hand to her 
mouth, but you could see her lips quirked in a smile. The toasts went 
on, some sweet, others silly, but all wrapped in love.

At the queen&#39;s subtle hand gesture, the band began to play. Uranus rose 
and offered Neptune her hand and guided her beloved to the middle of the 
ballroom floor. Uranus&#39; leading was so flawless that one almost forgot 
she was wearing a dress. She twirled Neptune around and brought her back 
close. They locked eyes and kept the intense gaze.

Inside Michiru felt like her heart would explode. She&#39;d loved this woman 
for centuries and today they had sealed their union in front of the 
people that they loved. She pressed closer to Haruka, afraid that the 
vision might shatter and she&#39;d find herself alone. Her gaze flicked to 
her wife&#39;s face only to find Haruka&#39;s eyes closed and a gentle smile 
playing on her lips.

&quot;You smell so good,&quot; she whispered.

The other woman giggled. They smiled at each other as the melody ended. 
Everyone applauded and Uranus bowed gallantly and kissed her wife&#39;s 
hand. To the violinist&#39;s surprise she felt a soft blush tinge her 
cheeks. So many years and she was still affected this way.

As the music was starting again, the king and queen advanced on the 
newlyweds. Endymion took Neptune&#39;s hand and Serenity was left with 
Uranus.

&quot;You look happy, Haruka-san.&quot; The queen seemed pleased.

Uranus spun her around and deftly brought the white-clad queen back into 
line.

&quot;Hai.&quot; The answer was simple but there was a joyous light there.

&quot;Still as good a dancer as I remembered.&quot;

The blonde laughed softly. &quot;It has been a long time, Princess.&quot;

When the song ended they traded partners yet again before coming back 
together for another song. Uranus didn&#39;t mind entertaining, but tonight 
she wanted to stay near her wife. This day was to celebrate their love 
and being apart from each other for long was not in her plans.

The place settings had silver chopsticks and the brides&#39; were engraved 
for them to have as keepsakes. Neptune made a point to sample a little 
of everything, but Uranus wasn&#39;t hungry at all. She only picked at her 
food. The photographer flitted around capturing unwary guests as they 
feasted on the delicacies the palace chef had created for the reception.

Overall, dinner was beautiful as many traditional dishes were served in 
honor of a not so traditional couple. When she was able to relax for a 
moment from the seemingly endless rounds of dancing and pictures, 
Michiru took in the tiny details. Everything was softened by a pinky 
taupe drape over white. There was a loosely followed sea motif as the 
cake had been decorated with seashells. The silverware was wrapped in 
napkins that were ornately tied with pink ribbon and nestled within the 
bow was a pink and white orchid.

She heard low, sexy laughter and followed it to its blonde source. 
Uranus was posing for pictures with Jupiter and Mars. They were all 
making fists for the camera. It was a show of strength that belied their 
dresses. After that they hugged and the blonde avatar of the wind made 
her way back to her bride.

Neptune touched her wife&#39;s arm and slid her hand down tugging Uranus 
closer. The blonde inclined her head.

&quot;I love you,&quot; the aqua haired woman whispered softly.

The blonde&#39;s look was tender and passionate as she cupped her wife&#39;s 
face and kissed her fully.

There were a few catcalls at that point and Haruka pulled away with a 
grimace realizing they were still very much the center of attention.

&quot;I&#39;m ready to go,&quot; Michiru whispered.

&quot;Me too.&quot;

They didn&#39;t have to leave the palace. A suite had been prepared for them 
and it was more sumptuous than any hotel could be. Only a few people 
knew that they would be there and they liked it that way. As they made 
their way for the door hands linked, several people noticed.

&quot;Wait! Wait!&quot; Venus shouted stopping her two friends in their tracks. 
&quot;Bubbles!&quot; she yelled with the authority of a field marshal.

There was a flurry of movement and it seemed only seconds passed before 
everyone had tiny white jars of bubbles with entwined rings.

The king and queen were in the center of the room resplendent in white 
and lavender. They waved Uranus and Neptune back to them. Mars tossed 
Serenity a microphone and the queen tapped it before making a smiling 
announcement.

&quot;We want to thank everyone for coming tonight to honor our close 
friends, Uranus and Neptune, on the day of their marriage.&quot; There was 
applause. The queen continued, &quot;They are leaving us now, but the party 
will go on.&quot; Cheers went up. &quot;Let&#39;s give our friends all of our good 
wishes and a proper send off.&quot; The giggling queen set the microphone 
aside as the king handed her a bubble jar.

The first few exploratory bubbles went up and then they began to 
multiply as more guests got the hang of it. Mercury stood in the corner, 
her planet symbol burning brightly on her forehead. She winked at the 
couple as they passed her and suddenly there was a cascading curtain of 
glittering balls floating around the room and out in the foyer giving 
the place a magical air. Uranus and Neptune ran through them laughing 
and sometimes gasping as several cold bubbles popped when they hit them, 
leaving icy kisses on their bare shoulders. When they reached the top of 
the stairwell, they were alone again. They went down the hallway hugging 
one another, blissfully happy and lost in each other&#39;s company.

In the room champagne was chilling, but Haruka ignored it, whispering to 
her lover in fervent tones.

&quot;Come now ...to your bedroom, to your bed and play there gently and 
sweetly with your bridegroom.&quot;

&quot;Sappho?&quot; Michiru questioned softly

Haruka&#39;s voice was barely audible as desire overwhelmed her. &quot;I think 
it&#39;s appropriate.&quot;

&quot;Mmm...&quot; Their lips met.

There was smoldering emotion in her teal eyes as the blonde kissed her 
wife. Michiru too didn&#39;t want to waste any more time and she pressed her 
body against her new bride. A powerful wave of passion tore through them 
leaving in its wake two very sleepy but well-satisfied women.</pre>
