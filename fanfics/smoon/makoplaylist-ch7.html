<h1>Makoto's Playlist (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chakeroo.html">chakeroo</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makoplaylist-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><p class="p1">“Hey Makochan! Come in! Come in!” Haruka said as she opened the door. “That’s 
a lot of food Makochan.” Haruka saw 3 bags full of food and tried to help Makoto 
inside.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well I thought I would make it a special day for… umm… Minachan.” Makoto 
blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So are you finally telling her how you feel about her?” inquired by the 
blonde while having a hard time carrying one of the bags to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">”Actually I don’t know. I’m just going with the flow today.” Makoto said and 
she put the two bags on the kitchen table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">”Oh okay. Well at least you came.” The blonde smiled. “Would you like me to 
help with anything…” her voice trailed off as she inspected the different foods of the 
bags.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s okay. I can handle this. Just go and have some fun with the others.” 
Makoto smiled and started preparing some utensils from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you sure?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yup.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Okay just call me or Michiru when you couldn’t find something or you need 
help with anything. We’ll be at the pool side arranging some stuff.” Haruka said then left 
the kitchen and went to the pool.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">……</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She’s already here. She’s in the kitchen.” Michiru gestured to Minako as the 
4 girls arrived.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako went to the kitchen and she saw Makoto cooking and preparing food. 
<i>She looks comfortable in a kitchen. Oh and she’s kinda dancing while doing it. She looks 
so cute.</i> She thought.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ami walked up to Minako and told her to get change so they could swim. Minako 
looked at Makoto lovingly then went to change to her swimsuit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto was almost done with all the food when Minako walked up to her. The 
blonde noticed that Makoto was smiling to herself. She patted Makoto’s shoulder and the 
brunette got surprised because she was still listening to the music really loud.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Oh her eyes, her eyes</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Makes the stars look like they’re 
not shining</p>
<p class="p3">Her hair, her hair</p>
<p class="p3">Falls perfectly without her trying</p>
<p class="p3">She’s so beautiful and I tell her everyday</p>
<p class="p3">I know, I know</p>
<p class="p3">When I compliment her she won’t believe me</p>
<p class="p3">And it’s so, it’s so</p>
<p class="p3">Sad to think she don’t see what I see</p>
<p class="p3">But every time she asks me</p>
<p class="p15">“Do I look okay?” I say…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When she saw Minako, who was wearing this white 2 piece bikini and her hair 
was tied in a pony tail, the brunette didn’t realize that she was staring at her and she 
stopped midway as she dumped the pasta water unto the sink. The hot water was scalding her 
hands quite a bit but she didn’t notice.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">When I see your face</p>
<p class="p3">There’s not a thing that I would change</p>
<p class="p3">Coz girl you’re amazing, just the way you are</p>
<p class="p3">And when you smile</p>
<p class="p3">The whole world stops and stares for a while</p>
<p class="p3">Coz girl you’re amazing just the way you are</p>
<p class="p17"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you okay Makochan?” Minako said as she got Makoto’s hands and inspected 
it. Makoto then unplugged one earphone from her ears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh yeah. Sorry.” Makoto blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Her lips, her lips</p>
<p class="p3">I could kiss them all day if she’d let me</p>
<p class="p3">Her laugh, her laugh</p>
<p class="p3">She hates it but I think it’s so sexy</p>
<p class="p3">She’s so beautiful and I tell her everyday</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto started to stare at Minako’s lips and they both blushed. Then the 
brunette brought the blonde closer to her and put one of the earphones to Minako’s ear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Oh you know, you know, you know</p>
<p class="p3">I’ll never ask you to change</p>
<p class="p3">If perfect’s what you’re searching for</p>
<p class="p3">Then just stay same</p>
<p class="p3">So don’t even bother asking if you look okay</p>
<p class="p3">Coz you know what I’ll say</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">When I see your face</p>
<p class="p3">There’s not a thing that I would change</p>
<p class="p3">Coz girl you’re amazing, just the way you are</p>
<p class="p3">And when you smile</p>
<p class="p3">The whole world stops and stares for a while</p>
<p class="p3">Coz girl you’re amazing just the way you are…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako turned beet red but Makoto didn’t notice because she was still staring 
at Minako’s lips. The blonde then took out the earphones after the song ended and gave it 
back to Makoto. She gave the brunette a kiss in the cheeks and then ran towards the pool 
area. Makoto smiled.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The whole day turned out to be great. Makoto and Minako seemed to get along 
fine, teasing and playing around with each other. Minako was even feeding Makoto while she 
served the food to the others. The other girls were watching intently and were happy with 
what was going on. After eating, Makoto then changed her clothes to a short shorts and 
bikini top and went to the pool area to swim with the girls.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Oh Kami… she’s so… beautiful… That toned and tanned body. Oh Kami those 
abs…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> Minako thought as Makoto walked 
towards the pool.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You might need a towel to wipe that drool…” Ami teased as she splashed some 
water to the blonde who was sitting at the edge of the pool. Minako blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto then sat beside the blonde and put her arms around her. Ami got up and 
excused herself. The rest of the group was still watching their every move. After a few 
minutes, they got up one by one and went inside the house to give them some privacy but 
were still peeking from the window but the two didn’t notice. They were all grinning and 
smirking.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So… when will you tell me that you’re leaving for England?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I… I told you last week. When you were at the location site of the café but 
you weren’t listening…” Minako’s heart was beating faster.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh…. Sorry…” Makoto tried to pull away but Minako didn’t let her. “So when 
will you come back?” she continued.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Before the summer ends I guess. I have to visit my parents there and look 
for some universities that I could attend.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“…”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh before I forget…” Minako stood up and went inside. After a few seconds 
she came back holding a big gift.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What’s this?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Just open it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto then unwrapped the gift. It was a teady bear, the same size as 
Jupiter. Makoto laughed and hugged the bear. She got up from the pool and held the bear 
towards the sky and said, “I shall name you, Venus.” Makoto laughed again then hugged the 
bear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako was giggling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Smells like you.” Blushed Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So you won’t be alone and forget about me when I go to England.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto then put the teady bear down and hugged Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I can’t forget you even if I try.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>That is the corniest, no, cheesiest pick up line Makoto.</i> The brunette 
thought. But Minako was happy Makoto said that.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The two didn’t notice that the group of girls were inching their way towards 
the two. They voted whether they will listen or not to the two’s conversation and listening 
won. They couldn’t hear much so they decided to hide behind the pool chairs near the pool. 
After the two’s conversation, Usagi couldn’t take it more and jumped up and said, 
“Soooooooooo sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!!!!!!!” The other girls joined her and teased the two.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After an hour or so, the excitement died down and all of them got changed, 
Minako was helping Ami and Rei with dishes as the other three cleaned up the mess at the 
pool area. After washing all of the dishes, Ami and Rei went outside and as Minako was 
walking towards the door, she saw Makoto’s iPod at the table. She got curious and turned it 
on then she saw “Minachan, my Tenshii” playlist. She smiled. She then listened to the songs 
and browsed through the iPod.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">There’s something about the look in your eyes</p>
<p class="p3">Something I noticed when the light was just right</p>
<p class="p3">It reminded me twice that I was alive</p>
<p class="p3">And it reminded me that you’re so worth the fight</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">My biggest fear would be the rescue of me</p>
<p class="p3">Strange how it turns out that way</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Could you show me dear</p>
<p class="p3">Something I’ve not seen</p>
<p class="p3">Something infinitely interesting</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">There’s something about the way you move</p>
<p class="p3">I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing</p>
<p class="p3">More subtle than something someone contrives</p>
<p class="p3">Your movements echo that I have seen the real thing</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you</p>
<p class="p3">Strange how it turns out that way</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Could you show me dear</p>
<p class="p3">Something I’ve not seen</p>
<p class="p3">Something infinitely interesting</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p8">She was listening to this song as she noticed a folder full of pictures of 
the group. She noticed in the pictures that they always end up besides in each other. She 
smiled and repeated the lyrics of the song, <i>Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you. 
Strange how it turns out that way.</i></p>
<p class="p5"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p8">Her face went beet red when she heard the full lyrics of the song Makoto let 
her listen to earlier. She listened intently and giggled.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Her lips, her lips</p>
<p class="p3">I could kiss them all day if she’d let me</p>
<p class="p3">Her laugh, her laugh</p>
<p class="p3">She hates it but I think it’s so sexy</p>
<p class="p3">She’s so beautiful and I tell her everyday</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her smile grew wider when “You’re the only exception” song played. <i>So 
that’s why I was singing it the morning after our date. She must have sung it to me while I 
was sleeping.</i> Minako thought.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Another song played and this particular song struck Minako. She also saw 
hidden folder containing pictures of just the two of them. Most of the pictures, Makoto was 
looking at Minako lovingly and Minako was just smiling, oblivious to Makoto’s emotions.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You by light, is the greatest find</p>
<p class="p3">In a world full of wrong</p>
<p class="p3">You’re the thing that’s right</p>
<p class="p3">Finally made it through the lonely</p>
<p class="p3">To the other side</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You said it again, my heart’s in motion</p>
<p class="p3">Every word feels like a shooting star</p>
<p class="p3">I’m at the edge of my emotions</p>
<p class="p15">Watching the shadows’ burn in the dark</p>
<p class="p17"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako’s eyes went wide as she heard the next lines.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">And I’m in love</p>
<p class="p3">And I’m terrified</p>
<p class="p3">For the first time and the last time</p>
<p class="p3">In my only life</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then she saw photos of them hugging each other or Makoto’s arms around the 
blonde’s shoulders, both of them were blushing and a single picture where Minako was the 
one looking at Makoto lovingly while their arms were around each other’s waists. But the 
brunette was looking at the camera and was laughing while blushing. The picture was taken a 
few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p3">This could be good</p>
<p class="p3">It’s already better than that</p>
<p class="p3">And nothing’s worse than knowing you’re holding back</p>
<p class="p3">I can be all that you needed</p>
<p class="p3">If you let me try</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">You said it again, my heart’s in motion</p>
<p class="p3">Every word feels like a shooting star</p>
<p class="p3">I’m at the edge of my emotions</p>
<p class="p3">Watching the shadows’ burn in the dark</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">And I’m in love</p>
<p class="p15">And I’m terrified…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>All of these songs described how she feels about me.</i> Minako began to 
cry tears of joy as she finally proved to herself that Makoto did have feelings for her. 
That everything the brunette were doing was not a coincidence or just being nice.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Just as she was wiping some of her tears, Makoto entered the room and was 
shocked when she saw Minako listening to her iPod. But Makoto misunderstood the tears as 
anger and disappointment in her as Minako found her feelings about the blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">”Minachan… I can explain… I… I’m…” before Makoto could finish her sentence, 
Minako hugged her and then the blonde went outside still holding the iPod. Makoto again 
misunderstood this and thought that blonde was shocked with what she found on the iPod that 
Minako just hugged her instead of confronting her. Makoto couldn’t take it anymore so she 
stormed out of the house and ran home.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako and the others went inside the house and just found the front door 
open.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh no! She misunderstood why I was crying!” Minako exclaimed. Minako 
couldn’t move. She didn’t know what to do at the moment. She didn’t want to scare Makoto 
further away from her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Haruka tried to call the brunette but she wouldn’t answer. Rei and Ami tried 
to catch up with Makoto but the brunette but they were too late. Michiru and Usagi tried to 
comfort the bewildered blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto got to her apartment fast. She bolted the door and then went straight 
to her room. She was crying like crazy and she didn’t know what to do. She threw her 
cellphone and it almost broke apart. She then sat at her bed holding her legs and cried 
herself until she fell asleep.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All of the girls came knocking on Makoto’s apartment but to no avail. She 
couldn’t hear them because she got so tired and stressed with all the thinking and crying 
that she fell in a deep sleep after. Minako stayed outside the door, holding Venus, after 
the others went home. She stayed until the sun came up, left the stuffed toy by the wall 
and a note. She had no choice but to leave because her flight was later that afternoon and 
she needed to fix her things for the flight.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto woke up a couple of hours later. She couldn’t see straight because her 
eye lids were almost closed as the effect of crying all night. She couldn’t bring herself 
to go to the airport and see Minako off so she tried calling Rei instead.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei’s phone rang and when she saw Makoto’s number, she answered, “Where are 
you Makochan? What the hell happened last night?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She had my ipod Rei. She knows what I’m feeling about her. She’s 
disappointed at me for falling in love with her. She was crying Rei. I scared her. I didn’t 
mean to.” Makoto’s voice was shaky. “Did she board the plane already?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“About 15 minutes ago. She waited for you here at the airport until the last 
minute. She even stayed outside your door until the morning. She left Venus outside your 
door” Said the miko. “She said just don’t do anything rash when she’s away. She needs to 
talk to you in person when she gets back.” Added the miko.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is that a bad thing or a good thing?” Makoto was holding back her tears 
while she got up and walked towards the door. She then opened the door and saw Venus the 
teady bear sitting up right by the wall on her apartment. She got the teady bear and hugged 
it and read the note.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Makochan. I am not angry with you. I promise. I just have to do something 
very important before we could talk about all of this. Please trust me on this one. Love, 
Mina.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>P.S. Just hug Venus if you feel sad or anything. I hope it will help. It 
helps me when I hug Jupiter. </i><span class="s4"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know Makochan. You should just wait and talk to her. It’s better 
that way. You wouldn’t believe any of us if we told you what really happened anyway and 
besides she said that she just needs to do something very important before she could face 
you and made us promise that we wouldn’t interfere.” Rei said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“…”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Makochan? Are you still there?” Rei was really worried.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, I’m still here. She left a note. She said I should trust her and wait 
for her.” Makoto was giving herself a mental slap for over reacting last night.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ami then got the phone from Rei and started talking Makoto. “I know this is 
hard on you Makochan but please trust us. Trust <i>her</i>. When she gets back, all of 
these will be sorted out. Don’t do anything stupid, okay? Will be there in an hour. Just 
keep your mind busy for a while.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Usagi and the others were nodding as they saw Minako’s airplane go to its 
designated runway.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Okay. Okay. I just wished I got to talk to her before she left.” Makoto 
said, burying her head at Venus as she cried.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She wished you were here too.” Ami said sadly.</p>
