<h1>Senshi Sabers (part 9 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sensabers-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The explosion lit up the night sky, a fireball rising
up against the velvet blackness. &quot;Damn it&quot; Rei
scowled, a thought and the tensing of muscles throwing
the scarlet armored figure aside, barely avoiding
being struck.

The Bio-boomer raced by, the artificial organic being
blending with the structure of the sleek sports car.
It almost looked like it was enjoying itself, raising
it&#39;s manhgled face to the wind as it streaked down the
crowded street.

&quot;We need to catch up with that thing&quot; Ami said
crisply, her ice blue armor skimming on the ground via
her boot jets&quot;before someone get&#39;s hurt.&quot;

Makoto fell in beside her&quot;We&#39;re not fast enough in
just the armor, ma&#39;am&quot;

Above them, using her suit to bound from rooftop to
rooftop, Minako kept track of their target. &quot;It&#39;s
still accellerating&quot; she reported&quot;probably overrrided
the safety features on the car.&quot;

There was a sound, the squeal of tires and the sleek
sportscar came around the corner to catch up with
them, the opentop convertable gleaming glossy black.
The sandy haired young woman caught up with the Senshi
easily, eyes focused on the road even as she
barked&quot;Need a lift&quot;

&#39;Haruka Tenoh?&#39; Rei thought in surprise, recognizing
the young woman she had seen at one of her concerts
not long ago. &quot;Stay out of this, it&#39;s a dangerous
situation&quot; she said, hoping the vocal distorters in
her armor were enough to disguise her voice.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be here, Tenoh&quot; Ami barked, her voice
sounding somewhat stressed.

&quot;You aren&#39;t going to catch this thing otherwise&quot;
Haruka shot back crisply&quot;now are one of you getting on
or not&quot;

There wa a moment they considered, then Makoto used a
burst of her bot thrusters to toss her up and down
into the passenger seat. &quot;Go&quot; she said crisply and
Haruka floored it, leaving Ami, Rei and Minako quickly
behind them.

&quot;Makoto&#39;s been hanging around you too long, Hino&quot; Ami
scowled as she tried to speed up.

&quot;Hey, I resemble that remark&quot; Rei shot back with a
grin.

Haruka kept an eye on the slowly growing figure ahead
of them, keeping a firm hand on the wheel as she did
so. &quot;Do you have a plan once we reach the Bio-boomer&quot;
she asked, swerving to dodge another vehicle.

&quot;I&#39;m going to have to jump aboard&quot; Makoto said
crisply.

&quot;Nice plan&quot; Haruka twisted the wheel to dodge an out
of control motorbike. The distance was quickly closing
between them and the car, the odd warping of the once
sleek car by the Bio-boomer becoming more and more
aparent.

Makoto slid to her feet, the green armored figure
carefully watching the distance as Haruka brought them
up alongside. She tensed her body, shifted forward,
then leapt even as she activated her boot thrusters
once again. With a loud crash she crossed the
distance, slamming a arm through the glass of a window
to get a grip.

The Bio-boomer twisted in it&#39;s perch to look down at
Makoto, then caught a glance at Haruka. The boyish
young woman narrowed her eyes, sparks rising around
her, then unnoticed by Makoto a powerful surge of
electricity leapt to strike it!

Makoto leavered herself up only to blink in surprise
at how... disoriented the Bio-boomer looked, almost
catatonic. Taking advantage she scrambled up towards
the creature, tearing at the artificially engineered
organics to wrap her hand around the heart crystal.
Clenching her fist she crushed it,. the car suddenly
slowing down before coasting to a stop.

&quot;Makoto&quot; Minako caught up in a few moments, the golden
armored figure looking her over worriedly&quot;Are you all
right&quot;

Makoto reached out to put her hand on her lovers
armored arm&quot;I&#39;m fine, really.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s sports car had made a u-turn and returned,
the sandy haired woman smiling a very self-satisfied
smile. Ami seemed almost chillingly stiff as she
said&quot;That was a very foolish thing you just did, young
lady.&quot;

&quot;Seemed like the right thing to do at the time&quot; she
answered mildly. Haruka smiled slightly&quot;Aren&#39;t I at
least going to get a thank you from the infamous
Senshi Sabers&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say thank you&quot; Makoto said simply&quot;I don&#39;t think
our thrusters could make it.&quot;

&quot;Not bad&quot; Rei admitted with a smile.

Haruka started her car, smoothly puling out into
traffic. She gave them a wave as she went&quot;I&#39;ll see you
again, ladies.&quot;

As sirens wailed in the distance they took off,
returning to the modified Silky Doll van and heading
back to base. Rei took her helm off, shaking her head
to get sweaty hair away from her face&quot;You were awfully
hard on that kid, Ami.&quot;

Ami already had her helmet in her lap. her expression
remote. &quot;You have no idea how dangerous that girl&#39;s
involvement was&quot; she answered coldly.

Rei couldn&#39;t resist the flash of anger&quot;Maybe I would
understand if you&#39;d actually break down and tell us
some of the secrets you keep.&quot; At Ami&#39;s surprised look
Rei smiled grimly&quot;Yes, I know you&#39;ve been holding
things back.&quot;

&quot;Information is need to know, only&quot; Ami answered
crisply as she moved towards the front of the van,
leaving Rei behind her while pulling the rest of her
armor off. &#39;She&#39;s more perceptive than I gave her
credit for,&#39; Ami admitted, &#39;I&#39;ll have to watch for
that.&#39;

Makoto Kino was comfortable behind the wheel, the
brown haired amazon having stripped herself of her
armor first so that she could drive. &quot;Hey boss&quot; she
nodded as Ami sat beside her.

&quot;It was foolish, bringing a civilian into our fight&quot;
Ami said crisply.

&quot;It was also necessary&quot; Makoto answered calmly&quot;I
didn&#39;t see any other way we were going to catch up
with that thing.&quot;

Coldly Ami said&quot;I had modules in the van to enhance
our speed, we could have caught it...&quot;

&quot;And how much damage could that thing have gone and
done while we were getting equipped&quot; Makoto challenged
Ami. She shook her head&quot;No, I think that was our best
choice, even if you don&#39;t want to admit it.&quot;

Ami sat back in her chair with a sigh. &quot;Hino has
deffinately been a bad influence on you&quot; she
muttered&quot;you never gave me this much trouble before
now.&quot;

&quot;Maybe so&quot; Makoto agreed&quot;but is that really a bad
thing&quot;

Ami smiled reluctantly&quot;Maybe not.&quot;

Rei kicked her helmet, bouncing it off the wall of the
van. &quot;Damn her&quot; she growled out&quot;condescending stuck up
piece of...&quot;

&quot;You need to cut down on your caffine&quot; Minako
commented, the gorgeous blonde not even looking up
from the game she was playing.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t bother you that Ami&#39;s holding information
back from us&quot; Rei waved her arms angrily, eyes
flashing.

&quot;No&quot; Minako answered simply.

&quot;Why&quot; Rei asked indignantly.

Reluctantly Minako put the game aside and looked up at
Rei with a smile. &quot;Because&quot; she explained
patiently&quot;while Ami holds certain things back, she
also will give us the information we need when we
really need it.&quot;

&quot;You trust her&quot; Rei realized.

Minako nodded&quot;Trust she&#39;s earned, Rei. When ever we&#39;ve
needed her Ami has delivered, even when it&#39;s cost her
badly.&quot;

Rei sighed softly, still looking more than a bit
annoyed. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll let it go for now&quot; she
scowled&quot;but I hope she comes clean soon.&quot;

Minako just smiled. Looking innocent she perkily
asked&quot;And have you gone to see the lovely Officer
Tsukino yet&quot;

Rei just growled under her breath.

Up front Ami dialed her cellphone, connecting with the
Mercury computer sustem back at home. &quot;One message
waiting, Ms. Mizuno.&quot; it said&quot;do you wish to play&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot; Ami answered.

&quot;Ami Mizuno&quot; the unfamiliar voice continued&quot;This is
Hotaru Tomoe. I&#39;d like to meet with you at your
earliest convenience regarding your mother&#39;s work for
the Infinity Organization.&quot;</pre>
