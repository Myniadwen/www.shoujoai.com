<h1>Red Senshi Diaries: The Next Chapter</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  Notes and Disclaimers: 
  In keeping with my self-appointed title as the Queen of the Derivative, this 
  is a sequel to &quot;Red Senshi Diaries&quot; written by Adam Jones.
  And yes - I know I&#39;ve already done the red bean bun bit - I&#39;m stealing it back 
  from Adam, who stole it from me. I had to throw it in for continuity&#39;s sake. 
  And because Stirling insists I always beat a joke to death anyway. I am more 
  annoyed about writing yet another Ami/Makoto fic...I hate being redundant. J 
  I also want to extra-super duper thank the members of the HAML who went over 
  this document with a fine tooth comb, finding all the errors, grammatical and 
  syntactical, for me, only to be told that I put &#39;em there on purpose. 
  And finally, this story is dedicated to the incomparable Dorothy L. Sayers - 
  if you&#39;ve read Gaudy Night you&#39;ll recognize the bit I stole. 
  You know the drill - tell me you found this amusing or diverting or at least 
  goofy.

Dear Diary, 

I have no idea why I wanted to write this down, I&#39;m not even sure I can tell the 
story right. But I had to tell someone and frankly, I didn&#39;t know who to tell. 
So here I am, telling it to my computer. Sheesh, how sad. 

Anyway, this story kind of starts with me in the kitchen. Well, not really, but 
I&#39;m starting it there, because that was where I realized what was going on. And 
it took me a while, mind you. I&#39;m no brainchild, but I&#39;m not the big stupid type 
either. If truth be told, I&#39;m better in school than Usagi and Minako, not that 
that means anything. I&#39;m at least as good as Rei, if not Ami. Heck, no one&#39;s 
better at school than Ami. Except for maybe Haruka and Michiru, and they&#39;re 
perfect, so it doesn&#39;t count. 

OK, I&#39;ll be honest, the real reason this story starts in the kitchen is that&#39;s 
where I do my best thinking. It relaxes me to cook. At first I did it because I 
thought that someone as naturally large and strong as myself ought to have a way 
to be more feminine, but that was years ago, and by now, its just natural that 
when I come home I sit down and start thinking. Which gets me hungry. Which 
makes me think of something I want to eat, which leads me to the kitchen. And so 
on. 

I&#39;ve just reread this beginning and I realize that, as I feared, I&#39;m going about 
this all wrong. Sigh. 

I guess I&#39;m going to have to start at the beginning beginning. 

It was summer vacation. Usagi had asked me to cover for her and tell anyone who 
asked that she was over my house when she wasn&#39;t. She said it was so she could 
go to a midnight movie, but pul-leease! How stupid does she think we are? 
Obviously, she was planning on seducing Mamoru, and if what Minako was telling 
me was true, later Rei. I&#39;m amazed it took that long, frankly. But that&#39;s 
entirely besides the point. 

The point is, we had been getting together almost every day for weeks, what with 
school and Senshi business, and vacation was kind of like a culmination of that. 
We literally were spending days and nights together. That whole summer it seemed 
like every memory I have has at least one of the others in it. 

I&#39;d been doing a lot of cooking for us, and to take the pressure off of Rei, I&#39;d 
invited the others over my house a few times a week. Ami never seemed 
comfortable in her own home, and Usagi and Minako had families around, so I 
thought I&#39;d be nice. This way I could serve good meals and make my friends 
happy. 

And that&#39;s when I noticed it, or thought I did. 

After a couple of years together, we pretty much knew everything about each 
other, I thought. Even the not so obvious stuff. Like Rei and Usagi never 
actually admitted they could stand one another, much less mentioning their 
attraction to each other, but like I said, we knew. So by that time, I could 
pretty much pick out what kind of guy Minako liked and when Rei and Usagi were 
going to argue, you know stuff like that. And I thought I had Ami figured out 
too. She was a classic shy romantic. The stuff that made all of us sigh 
wistfully, she was a total sucker for. She&#39;d sniffle at romantic films, and a 
single rose (NOT red, none of us can even look at one without giggling or 
shuddering these days) makes her melt. The last thing I&#39;d ever expect from Ami 
was...how do I put this? 

One day, a little before vacation, we&#39;d been at Rei&#39;s as usual. It had actually 
been quiet, Senshi-wise, and Usagi suggested we all go out for ice cream. Not 
like that was a rare occasion - she pretty much suggested it every day. But that 
day we agreed and we were all at the Crown, at our usual table. Minako thought 
she had a bead on some idol and she was going on about him, and Rei, who thought 
he was cute, was chiming in now and then. I had pretty much gone off boy idols 
after the whole Starlights thing, and was staring out the window. 

I felt a ping, you know, the kind of thing when someone&#39;s watching you, hard. So 
I turned away from the window and looked around. The only person facing me in 
the place was Ami. I caught her eye and she smiled at me, quietly, almost, well, 
almost mysteriously. I&#39;ve never seen that look on her face before. She&#39;s always 
had eyes that looked a little sad, almost worldly, but this time there was a 
twinkle in them, a mischievous twinkle, I thought. 

She licked her lips with the tip of her tongue, then lowered her mouth to the 
straw in her drink. I must have been gaping, because Minako immediately caught 
my expression and looked past Ami into the Crown&#39;s interior. 

&quot;OK, where is he?&quot; she asked, loudly. 

&quot;Who?&quot; My voice cracked a bit and I&#39;m sure I blushed. 

&quot;The guy who looks like your old sempai.&quot; I&#39;m sure that phrase wouldn&#39;t have 
been half so offensive if they hadn&#39;t all said it at the same time. 

I laughed and waved it off, and took the tease with a fair amount of grace, but 
out of the corner of my eye, I&#39;m positive I saw Ami smirk. 

When later I turned to address her, her face was as it always was, a little sad, 
quiet and reserved. And her voice was perfectly normal. I thought I must have 
made the whole thing up. 

And it might have stayed at that, but then I got this idea. I invited everyone 
over for a snack the next day and made one of my favorite treats. Usagi&#39;s nuts 
for meat buns, but I love the sweet red bean buns. Can&#39;t get enough of &#39;em. So I 
thought I&#39;d make them and while everyone was eating, ask Ami for some help and 
ask her what was up. What can I say - I&#39;m a blunt kind of a girl. One more thing 
my old sempai didn&#39;t like. Jerk. 

But it didn&#39;t work that way. We were sitting there, and Rei and Usagi were, as 
usual, bickering over how much Usagi ate. It had taken me a while to realize 
that this was the way they masked their flirting. Minako and I talked about it 
once and we decided that if they don&#39;t actually resolve this soon, we&#39;re going 
to tell them to take it to a motel room. We had a good laugh about that, anyway. 
So now, when they start in, we all pretty much just tune it out. 

Minako had gone off to the toilet and Rei and Usagi were actually rolling on the 
floor, pinching and yelling at each other. I rolled my eyes and turned to catch 
Ami&#39;s, figuring she&#39;d understand what I felt. And I felt it again. That ping. 

A little slowly, like in a movie, you know - the significant turn towards a 
person - I turned. And sure enough, Ami was watching me. I could hear Usagi and 
Rei in the background, but only barely over the buzz in my own head. 

Ami never took her eyes off me as she lifted one finger, drew it through the 
filling of the bun, then very delicately, very seductively licked off the tips 
of her finger. I must have blacked out or something, because the next thing I 
know, I hear Usagi asking Ami about the bun and Rei and she making some comment 
about it. I have no idea what I said, or they said --all I could see was the 
blood pulsing in my eyes, and that vision of Ami, her eyes actually sparkling at 
me as she licked her finger. Just thinking about it made me pant. 

Eventually the evening ended and I managed to get everyone to leave, closed the 
door behind them and leaning back against the door heaved a sigh. I have no idea 
what Ami was trying to do, but I knew what she was doing...to me anyway. 

Let me back up here. I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m some kind of pervert. I&#39;m 
not. I&#39;ve always been attracted to guys...guys with longish brown hair. Or short 
blond hair. Or black hair... and nice eyes. Or blue hair...yeah, short blue hair 
and blue eyes. And really smart. I definitely like guys like that. But that&#39;s 
not the point. The point is, I like guys. Why am I even trying to justify this? 
I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m thinking these days. Okay, the point is, well, if I 
did like girls, I&#39;d have to like girls like Ami. She&#39;s so sweet, not in a 
bubble-headed way like Usagi, or a tougher-than-nails way like Rei, or &quot;I want 
everyone to love me&quot; way like Minako. She&#39;s very real, very down to earth, 
despite being a super brain. And she is a brain - one of the smartest people on 
the planet, I bet. And she doesn&#39;t even really realize it. That&#39;s part of her 
charm. 

Charm. What a funny word. She does have it though - she can dance, she&#39;s really 
naturally graceful... 

Anyway, well, I guess I&#39;ll be honest. Yes - I had thought about her that way, 
you know...that way. You can&#39;t stop what you imagine can you? But that&#39;s not the 
same as doing anything about it, is it? 

I went into the kitchen and without even thinking about it, began to cook. So 
there I was, beating some eggs like they were the damned and I was an infernal 
demon (can you tell we&#39;re doing Dante&#39; in literature class?) when it dawned on 
me. And all of a sudden, a germ of an idea came to mind. It seemed so natural 
that I wasn&#39;t even surprised at the time. 

And while I have never actually heard that the way to a woman&#39;s heart is through 
her stomach, I have frequently seen Usagi&#39;s finer instincts completely overruled 
by her baser ones, so I thought I was pretty much safe. And if my plan failed, 
well, then, I&#39;d have a nice meal with a friend and that would be it. 

And I remember nodding the way we do when we&#39;re given an order in school, 
because it seemed like the thing to do. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

The weekend couldn&#39;t come fast enough, and came way too fast, if you know what I 
mean. We were sitting, as almost always, at the Shrine and Rei announced a pool 
party at a school friend&#39;s house. Usagi grinned and Minako and I shared a look 
that clearly said &quot;Finally!&quot; but Minako, being Minako, also said she&#39;d go. That 
girl should work for the tabloid papers as an investigative reporter. 

Ami demurred, as we all kind of expected, and when it got to me I found myself 
speaking as if what I was saying was the complete truth. I couldn&#39;t believe how 
good an acting job I did! I told them that I still had the history class project 
to do (I didn&#39;t, it had been done for over week) and looked sheepish when Minako 
remonstrated with me. As I had hoped, Ami jumped at the chance to assist me with 
the assignment. Like I said - I thought I knew her pretty well. I looked more 
cheerful and it was agreed. She&#39;d come over the next morning and we&#39;d get to 
work. 

Yes indeed - that was just what I had in mind. 

I spent that night cleaning up, which wasn&#39;t hard since I live in a small place 
and keep it pretty neat. I did go through the cabinets and take stock of what I 
had lying around. I&#39;ve never cooked a meal with the purpose of a 
seduction...excluding the time I cooked for Motoki, but that doesn&#39;t count. No - 
it doesn&#39;t, whatever you might think. 

I was just being nice. 

So of course, when I finally lay down to go to sleep, it was way too late. I 
felt terrible and then couldn&#39;t get to sleep at all. I lay there, listening to 
the traffic go by for hours. Eventually I turned my clock over so I couldn&#39;t see 
what time it was, it was just too damn depressing. About 4 AM I must have 
finally fallen asleep. 

When I awoke, my head pounded, I felt plain awful and there was someone knocking 
at the door. It took me a little longer than it should have to figure out what 
was going on, but when Ami&#39;s voice called out my name in a tone that was 
genuinely worried, I realized, at last, that I had overslept. I grabbed the 
clock and sure enough, when I flipped it, I had accidentally turned off the 
alarm! I bet my face was pretty comical as I gaped at the time, but I was in no 
position to appreciate it. 

In a rush, which only made me feel even worse, I stood up and ran to the door. 
When I pulled it open, Ami stepped back in alarm. I know I&#39;m not a pretty site 
in the morning - I bet had bags under my eyes and everything...but geez! 
Whatever happened to manners? Ami&#39;s hand covered her mouth and she turned away 
as she began to laugh at me. Nice. What did I say? Charm? Hunh. She was 
hysterical at my expense and I felt like utter crap. 

When she got herself under control she pushed me lightly back into my room and 
closed the door behind her. I wonder if anyone has ever told her that those 
little boots she wears are adorable? I watched her remove them and step up into 
the living area. 

&quot;You look awful!&quot; She looked around the apartment and smiled ruefully. &quot;I bet 
you stayed up late cleaning and cooking, didn&#39;t you?&quot; I just nodded, liking the 
way she was moving around my apartment so confidently. She seemed so, so, out of 
character somehow, like there was a separate personality that lurked underneath 
the quiet, reserved Ami we all knew. I was rather enjoying it, to tell the 
truth. 

&quot;Did you,&quot; she commented as she moved into the kitchen, &quot;bother making yourself 
anything for breakfast?&quot; I shook my head...a bad idea. I groaned and she looked 
at me sharply. &quot;Sit!&quot; she pointed towards my futon. 

I looked at her balefully, then seeing the fierce demeanor, the strength in her 
and mostly, the fact that someone was willing to take care of me for a few 
minutes, I gave up and crawled back into my bed. 

I let my eyes close, listening to the sound of someone puttering in my kitchen. 
I thought it would bother me, but I was surprised to find that it was soothing, 
almost comforting. I relaxed back onto my pillow with a sigh. 

What seemed like a few minutes later, Ami touched me gently on the shoulder, and 
my eyes popped open. My head didn&#39;t hurt as much and I felt marginally better. 
Ami was kneeling next to my bed holding a cold compress and a cup of tea. A bowl 
of tea rice sat next to her. I took the tea and smiled as she draped the 
compress across my neck. I sipped, then traded the cup for the bowl and 
chopsticks. After a few bites, we traded again. The food and tea made me feel 
much better and at last I felt well enough to engage Ami in conversation. 

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry about oversleeping...&quot; I began, but Ami shushed me. 

&quot;Don&#39;t mention it. Mako-chan, you do too much for us as it is. Maybe its time 
you let someone take care of you.&quot; Her eyes met mine and she smiled brilliantly 
at me. But there was that sadness I could always see in her. I opened my mouth 
to speak, but she spoke first. &quot;I never get to take care of my Mother - she&#39;s 
always so busy.&quot; She turned away slightly, and set down the empty bowl and 
chopsticks. When she turned back, I could see that the sadness had passed. Well, 
heck, if it would make her feel better to take care of me, then I&#39;d be useless 
for a day. 

At last she let me up from the futon, and I mentioned that I ought to dress, so 
we could start on that project. She grimaced slightly and made a vague gesture. 

&quot;You don&#39;t really want to work on that yet, do you? How about we get you to a 
bath first? In your condition, it might make you feel better.&quot; She used that 
&quot;doctorly&quot; voice she unconsciously uses when she&#39;s ordering you to do something, 
so I just smiled and agreed. Like I was going to refuse. I may have felt 
terrible, but I hadn&#39;t forgotten what I was planning on for later. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

So that&#39;s how I ended up in the bath with Ami. 

Of course, we had shared a bath before. All of us, or some of us. We&#39;d even been 
together at hot springs more than once. But that wasn&#39;t the same. OK, the only 
real difference was in my head, but it was real enough! 

I tried not to look like I wasn&#39;t trying to look as we undressed. That&#39;s pretty 
hard, I&#39;ll have you know. We were chitchatting like you do, but when Ami took 
off her shirt, I had to turn away slightly and fight a sudden knot in my laces 
on my blouse. Mostly because the one in my throat made it hard to speak. So I 
didn&#39;t try for a moment, and focused on the knot until I got the lace untied. By 
that time, Ami was wrapped in a towel and I was able to communicate again. I 
think I&#39;m not cut out for subterfuge though, because I&#39;m fairly sure that Ami 
was grinning at me the whole time. 

We sat ourselves down to wash and she pulled her stool close to mine. I felt 
reasonably secure about this - we were in public after all, she wasn&#39;t going to 
try anything too obvious. I found myself rather disappointed, to be honest. 

&quot;I&#39;ll wash your back first, then you can do mine.&quot; I was amazed that her voice 
was so rational, so calm. I could barely get the basic syllables of &quot;yes&quot; and 
&quot;no&quot; to come out of my mouth. If she hadn&#39;t been enjoying my discomfiture so 
much, I might have even tried to leave. 

Backscrubbing went by without incident, as did the bathing itself. Nonetheless, 
everytime I looked at her, her eyes were there, meeting my own. I found it hard 
to breathe in the hot, wet air. 

&quot;I&#39;m hungry.&quot; I dissembled, wondering when this whole affair had left my 
control, not sure I had ever had any control of it, &quot;let&#39;s go back to my place 
for some lunch.&quot; By now I felt much more like my old self. I stood and 
stretched, blushing as I caught her watching me. But as I lowered my arms, I 
wondered what it was that I was afraid of, and stretched again, this time, not 
worrying that she watched. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Once back at my place, I felt far more confident than I had up to this point. 
After all - I&#39;m the chef. A woman&#39;s kitchen is her palace, as Minako would say, 
and with that thought it was my turn to order Ami to sit, while I prepared 
lunch. 

I was pretty sure I had overthought this, but I had decided on a lot of little 
finger foods for lunch. Small sandwiches, like they eat in all those English 
novels, cookies, hors d&#39;ouevres, that kind of thing. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever 
noticed, but you can really tell a lot about a person by the way they eat. Take 
Usagi for instance - she wolfs her food, with obvious relish and an absolute 
lack of grace. Says it all, huh? 

And I would have said that Ami was exactly the way she ate her food, polite, 
delicate, but not reticent...except for that red bean bun. With that thought, I 
felt a little warm, and stepped out of the kitchen for a moment, to get some 
fresh air. 

Ami was kneeling quietly at the table, reading. Her eyes were on the page, 
anyway, but they looked far away. I watched her for a moment, noticing the way 
her hair almost fell into her eyes, the soft line of her shoulders and I 
realized that leaving the kitchen hadn&#39;t helped at all. I took a step back and 
she glanced up for a second, then back down at her book. When I was able to 
focus on her again, I could see that she was flushed, the color flaming across 
her cheeks, and she was panting like she had run a great distance. I felt a bit 
out of breath myself, and turned quickly to retreat into the kitchen. 

At last I felt that I could look at her again without fainting, so I picked up 
the tray and came into the living area. Ami stood to help me, her fingers just 
brushing mine as she took the tray from me. I know I blushed, but I smiled at 
her anyway and went back into the kitchen to retrieve the drinks. 

What a meal that was! We began with the hors d&#39;ouevres and I waited with bated 
breath to see if Ami took the bait, as it were. She didn&#39;t disappoint. We must 
have seemed a bit silly, I guess, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re the first people to flirt 
over food, but neither of us had ever done it before and it was a bit of a 
revelation. To me, at least. 

I have never noticed, for instance, what very graceful hands Ami had. I&#39;ve 
watched her fingers fly over her computer keyboard, but never realized how 
precise they had to be to type so accurately. This afternoon, for the first 
time, I was captivated, as Ami picked up a sandwich wedge and brought it towards 
her mouth. Her lips parted slightly, then she paused and laughed at me. 

I&#39;m sure by now I was beet red, but we had pretty much obviously come to the 
same conclusion, - we were here for the same reason. So I was not going to let a 
little embarrassment stop me. 

Ami leaned forward and gestured at me slightly with the sandwich. I looked at 
her, then her hand, and slowly opened my mouth. She leaned forward a little more 
then inserted the tip of the sandwich into my mouth. I bit down and she pulled 
away, then resumed the motion of sandwich wedge towards her own mouth. When I 
was little, I was told not to share food with other kids because it was an 
indirect kiss. I thought about that now, as I chewed and swallowed the sandwich. 
Still smiling at me, Ami repeated the motions and the sandwich was completely 
consumed. 

I have no idea what it tasted like. 

I kept having trouble not giggling and asking this girl in front of me where Ami 
was and what she had done with her. 

I probably hadn&#39;t taken a real breath in ten minutes. 

I never wanted this moment to end. 

But it did. It was obviously my turn this time. I chose an hors d&#39;ouevre - 
something cute and decorative that I knew would taste good, since I had sampled 
it last night, some canape or other. I picked it up, trying like hell not to 
bobble it and held it up for a moment. Ami nodded and I grinned at her, swiped 
one finger through the topping and held it out towards her. She closed her eyes 
and opened her mouth. 

What else could I do? It was too great a temptation... 

I smeared her nose with the filling on my finger, licked the rest off, sat back 
and howled with infantile laughter. 

Her eyes opened, glittering strangely. She wiped her nose off, looked at me hard 
and did the only rational thing she could have done...she grabbed up another 
canape and shoved it into my face. 

And naturally, a food fight ensued. You have no idea how easy it is to toss 
small hors d&#39;ouvres and finger food across a small apartment until you try. Ten 
minutes later there was barely a thing left on the table, we were both covered 
in food and breathlessly hysterical. 

We lay back on the floor, catching our breath and giggling, when she rolled over 
and hovered above me. Immediately my laughter caught in my throat. Her hair 
looked so soft, I reached one hand up to touch it. Her smile disappeared and she 
looked quite seriously at me. 

&quot;You have some food on your face.&quot; She said, still immensely earnest. I moved to 
wipe it away, but she stopped my hand before it reached my cheek. Lowering her 
head to mine, I could barely feel the brush of her lips against my skin, then 
gasped as the cool wetness of her tongue removed the offending food. I closed my 
eyes as her hair moved over my face, her lips closer to my own now. She kissed 
me again, pressing into my cheek warmly. I turned lightly and our lips met. 

Should I bother trying to describe the sensation? Its been done so many times, 
by people who write better than I can...well, it was sweeter than anything I&#39;d 
ever felt before. My whole body exploded. I know I put my arms around her neck 
and drew her into me. I felt like my skin could breathe for me, like I never 
wanted to let go. 

After a long time we broke apart, gasping for air. She lay back on the 
food-spotted carpet once again and it was my turn to hover over her. I grabbed 
up a strawberry - one of the few items that had remained untossed in our 
previous battle - and held it over her mouth. Obediently, she opened up and I 
lowered it gently onto her tongue. She closed her mouth, then leaned upwards 
towards me. I met her halfway and kissed her. When her mouth opened under mine, 
the sweetness of the strawberry was nothing compared to the sweetness of her 
tongue. It was sublime. 

From there we made short work of whatever food we could get our hands on. And 
all the while I was learning what Ami felt like and what she tasted like. For 
the second time that day I got to see her without her shirt, and this time I 
wasn&#39;t forced to look away. For the second time I completely lost my ability to 
speak, but this time it was because she had lifted one breast to my mouth. Thank 
you gods that I was able to live to this moment - that&#39;s all I have to say. 

Once upon a time, a couple of years ago I made a statement that I have since 
come to regret. I said, in front of a whole group of people that I should be 
able to play Snow White because my breasts were bigger...you&#39;d have think I 
shucked my clothes right there and then. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had a moment of 
peace where someone didn&#39;t tease me about it. Minako, mostly, but I always just 
tell her she&#39;s jealous and that shuts her up. 

The point is, at last I had cause not to regret the truth of the statement. Ami 
didn&#39;t seem put off by their size, and she devoured me, running her tongue 
across my nipples until I squirmed. 

Needless to say, it got hotter and heavier at that point. What can I say that 
hasn&#39;t been said? That Ami tasted like ambrosia? That her lips and tongue made 
me scream with rapture, that when she entered me if I had died that moment I 
would have regretted missing nothing in my life? What is left to say? I suppose 
only this, at some point I realized that Ami knew me better than I knew her, or 
myself, and I abandoned myself to her. After so many years alone it was a very 
nice feeling. And I swore in my mind that I&#39;d do anything to make her happy. 

I moved between her legs, tickling her with my hair, catching her hands in my 
own, placing them on my head, so she could direct me. I ran my tongue across her 
lower lips tentatively, then a little more firmly when she rewarded me with a 
heartfelt moan. I teased her, but not too much, then I treated her to the same 
sensation she had given me. And it was just as nice on this side. 

That was pretty much the way it went all afternoon, into the evening. Night had 
fallen at some point. We lay together on my futon, stroking each other softly 
and murmuring the kinds of things you do (or at least I assume so, since it&#39;s 
always like that in books and movies.) 

All of a sudden I realized the flaw in my clever plan. I cleared my throat and 
spoke in a &quot;normal&quot; tone of voice. 

&quot;Um, Ami? About that history project?&quot; 

&quot;Mmmm?&quot; She looked up at me. 

&quot;Uh, well, that is...I don&#39;t actually need your help with it. I finished it 
already.&quot; 

She smiled gently and kissed me on the lips. &quot; I know. I saw you finish it at 
Rei&#39;s last week.&quot; 

&quot;You knew?&quot; I was incredulous, but then, began to laugh. &quot;You had me all figured 
out, didn&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;Mmmm...&quot; Ami didn&#39;t bother answering, but pulled my head down to hers...

&quot;Whatcha readin?&quot; Minako&#39;s voice was muffled with the cake she was eating. She 
leaned over Usagi&#39;s arm, but the smaller girl leaned away protectively. 

&quot;Nothing. Just something Umino was showing me.&quot; Usagi smiled slyly, 
&quot;Although...you&#39;d probably get a kick out of it too...&quot; 

And she handed the sheets of paper over to Minako and settled down to watch her 
read it.
