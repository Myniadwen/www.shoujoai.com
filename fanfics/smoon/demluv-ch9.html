  Ikuko felt frustrated as she crawled her way 
through the congested traffic, and arrived home 
some forty minutes later. She parked behind 
Usagi&#39;s electric blue WRX wagon. It was stuffed 
with what Usagi deemed her &#39;traveling rig&#39; which 
generally meant a trip to Makoto&#39;s house for a 
&#39;drum session&#39;. Ikuko smiled.
  Out of all Usagi&#39;s friends, Ikuko enjoyed 
Makoto the most. Makoto was open, frank and fun 
to be with. She was a whiz in the kitchen and 
with plants... Ikuko&#39;s favorite things. Ikuko 
loved it when she saw Mako&#39;s green pick-up 
parked outside her house. She always seemed to 
be involved with something, and what she hauled 
in the back of her truck reflected it... usually 
her drum set, plants, and garden or kitchen 
supplies.
  She turned her head towards the back seat and 
noticed both girls had crashed. She sighed. Good 
grief! She walked around the car and opened the 
passenger seat door and picked up Usagi&#39;s 
backpack and put it on. She determined there 
must have been bricks stored in it. Ikuko opened 
the door closest to Rei to grab the guitar and 
Rei&#39;s gym bag with a sigh. She walked back 
around to open the girl&#39;s door. Rei opened her 
eyes and noticed with Ikuko, Usagi&#39;s heavy 
labored breaths. 
  Rei looked up at Ikuko. 
  &quot;I&#39;ll help her to her bed, Mrs. Tsukino. It&#39;s 
no problem.&quot;
  Ikuko looked relieved. 
  &quot;Thank you, Rei, you&#39;re a real life-saver! 
I&#39;ll go open the door for you.&quot;
  Rei crawled out the other car door, grabbed 
and put on her backpack and walked around to 
Usagi&#39;s door. She didn&#39;t want crawl over the top 
of her and hurt her. 
  &quot;Usagi, you&#39;re home, wake up!&quot;
  Usagi roused and mumbled something incoherent. 
Rei shook her gently and spoke louder. 
  &quot;I&#39;m coming!&quot; Usagi responded grumpily.
  Rei had her arm around Usagi&#39;s waist and 
walked slowly, but Usagi began to sag.
  &quot;Rei, I feel... weak.&quot; 
  Usagi took two steps and passed out. 
  Rei scooped her friend up effortlessly and 
carried her the rest of the way.
  Ikuko marveled at Rei&#39;s strength, and wondered 
at the same time, what the back of Rei&#39;s shirt 
had meant. She decided she didn&#39;t want to know. 
It was some personal statement... a teenager 
thing. She ran ahead of Rei to open Usagi&#39;s room 
door upstairs.
  Ikuko reflected on how small the room had 
become over the years with the clutter of 
musical equipment and artwork supplies. She 
smiled slightly as she set the gym bag and 
guitar on the floor near the door. She shrugged 
Usagi&#39;s backpack off and put it on the computer 
chair. 
  Shingo&#39;s room was in a similar state with 
sports equipment. 
  Her babies had grown up, but they still needed 
her she noted as Rei climbed the stairs and 
carefully approached with a limp Usagi. It 
seemed as though Usagi had rapidly deteriorated 
right before her eyes.
  Rei entered the room with her precious burden. 
Rei could audibly hear Usagi&#39;s chest rattle now, 
and could feel the heat of her slight body 
through her clothes. Rei personally felt that 
Usagi was too sick to be at home, and wanted 
desperately to take her to the hospital, but she 
kept it to herself. 
  Rei didn&#39;t know whether or not to curse Usagi 
for not being more careful with herself while 
she was with Mamoru, or curse herself and the 
other senshi for not insisting that she slow 
down. Not everything was so important it 
required all her heart and soul poured into it.
  Over the last month or so, all of them had 
seen she was under some sort of strain, but 
since Usagi had never complained, they hadn&#39;t 
taken it seriously. Then she realized how none 
of them had ever really taken Usagi&#39;s complaints 
of hunger seriously, and had for the most part, 
made fun of her eating habits. They hadn&#39;t paid 
much attention to her tiredness either, and 
there again everyone had picked on her. 
  It dawned on Rei that somewhere along the 
line, Usagi had either grown up, or gotten tired 
of the snide remarks about her habits. She had 
stopped in her effort to bring attention to her 
needs. 
  Rei felt a lump rise in her throat and tried 
to blink away tears that suddenly formed in her 
eyes. Usagi had given the world herself as its 
Messiah many times, the last time was to fight 
the demon Chaos and free Galaxia. 
  She held the most important person in their 
entire universe in her arms, and knew in her 
heart that she, and the other senshi had blown 
it big time. Usagi graciously loved them all, 
anyway. 
  Rei swallowed the lump in her throat, 
painfully, and almost choked on it. Usagi loved 
and trusted Mars, the worst offender, most of 
all. Rei felt like a jerk.
  Rei lay Usagi down on her bed carefully, then 
impatiently wiped her tears away, and looked at 
Ikuko. 
  &quot;I&#39;ll get her PJs on her, if you will get her 
medicine ready, Ikuko Mama.&quot; Rei shucked her 
backpack near Usagi&#39;s desk.
  Ikuko hadn&#39;t missed Rei&#39;s tears, and came over 
to put her arms around her. As Ikuko squeezed 
Rei, she smiled. 
  &quot;Thank you, Rei, for catching her before she 
fell. We&#39;ll get through this, I promise. She&#39;s 
been sick before, and it will happen again. 
Believe me, she&#39;s really a lot tougher than she 
looks. 
  I&#39;ll leave you two alone while I find out what 
her medicine instructions require. I want to 
take her temperature, too. Then I need to 
seriously cook dinner before Kenji comes home, 
and skins me alive!&quot; Ikuko left, and closed the 
door quietly behind her. 
  Rei smiled slightly as she tried to imagine 
Kenji in an attempt to catch her first.
  Rei rummaged through Usagi&#39;s pajama drawer and 
settled on a comfortable boxer short/T-shirt 
combo. She brought her selection over to the 
western style bed. Rei lifted Usagi&#39;s torso, 
pulled the borrowed shirt up over Usagi&#39;s head, 
then quickly unhooked the white lace bra. Rei 
slid both garments over Usagi&#39;s arms. Rei took 
out the odangos, and let the long platinum blond 
hair cascade down onto the bed. 
  Usagi was as light, as Rei was dark. 
  Rei took the pajama top and pushed it over 
Usagi&#39;s head, then drew the mass of soft blond 
hair through. She next pulled Usagi&#39;s arms 
through the arm holes one at a time. 
  Usagi started to come around with all the 
activity, but made no protest. 
  Rei unfastened Usagi&#39;s short pink skirt, and 
pulled it down over the long slender legs, and 
exposed a pair of red silk underwear, borrowed 
from her own drawer. Rei smiled at the slight 
bagginess, and pulled the boxers up over the 
underwear.
  Finished, Rei leaned forward and kissed 
Usagi&#39;s cheek.  
  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry about everything, Usa, I feel 
like such a jerk. I have given you so little 
attention. I promise from now on I will never 
again ignore your needs. You can complain about 
anything you want to, and I will fulfill your 
every desire and spoil you rotten! This will 
never, ever happen again. I hope you can forgive 
all of us one more time.&quot; She declared, softly. 
  Usagi drowsily replied. 
  &quot;Be careful what you promise, it could be 
construed as an oath, and I may hold you to it!&quot;
  Rei happily kissed her cheek again and gave 
her a small hug. 
  &quot;You little trouble-maker! Do you need any 
help to get to the bathroom, or anything?&quot; Rei 
asked.
  Usagi couldn&#39;t resist.
  &quot;No thank you. I gave at the office!&quot; She 
snickered. 
  Rei guffawed. 
  &quot;Oooo, Usa, that was really bad! Will you let 
me know if you need anything at all? I&#39;m here 
for you.&quot; 
  Usagi nodded. 
  &quot;Oh you&#39;ll be the first one I call... 
particularly if my stomach hurts!&quot;
  &quot;You are just too kind!&quot; Rei mocked.
  &quot;Um... Rei?&quot; Usagi began.
  &quot;Hmmm?&quot; Rei answered.
  &quot;I think I am... um, sick. I... I feel like I 
have a fever. 
  If I do, I know my mom won&#39;t let me see 
anybody. Rei, I really need to see Mamoru and 
Setsuna right away. When Mom says I can have 
visitors, could you please arrange to have them 
come over? 
  Its important.&quot; 
  Usagi coughed hard and deeply.
  Rei held Usagi up and close to her own chest. 
She rubbed her friend&#39;s back gently in the hope 
that it would help her to breathe easier. 
  When the paroxysm had subsided, Rei whispered 
to her. 
  &quot;Of course, Baby, I&#39;d be glad to!&quot; Rei felt 
real fear for her friend. She felt miserable as 
she watched Usagi shiver and her teeth chatter 
uncontrollably. 
  &quot;Here let me at least help you under this 
bedding.&quot; Rei offered. 
  She lifted Usagi&#39;s backside up with her right 
arm, while she pulled the sheet and blanket down 
with her left. Usagi slipped her legs between 
the cotton sheets. Rei covered her friend up all 
the way to her neck. 
  Usagi coughed again so hard, it frightened 
Rei.
  &quot;Don&#39;t you dare die on me,&quot; Rei hissed, 
&quot;doesn&#39;t your ginsuishou ever do anything 
besides suck the life out of you? 
  Can&#39;t it heal you?&quot; She spat angrily.
  Usagi blinked at her, and gasped for air as 
she grasped Rei&#39;s upper right arm, and pulled 
her right ear closer. 
  &quot;It is... healing me... it just takes... time. 
I&#39;m not going to... die! I want to live... 
because of you! I... won&#39;t leave you... alone.&quot; 
Usagi relaxed her grip and closed her eyes. 
  &quot;I love you, Rei.&quot;
  Rei kissed her hot forehead tenderly. 
  &quot;And I love you, my angel.&quot; Rei rasped out 
softly.  
  Ikuko chose that moment to knock on the door. 
She had heard Usagi&#39;s coughs and hurried. 
  &quot;Come!&quot; Rei called, relieved.
  Ikuko came in, and put a small tray of 
steaming food down on the bedside table. She 
looked at her daughter, and apologized for the 
long wait. Kenji had gotten home early. She 
nonchalantly smacked Rei&#39;s hand away and 
thwarted her invasion on the food. 
  &quot;You can go keep Kenji, and Shingo company 
downstairs at the supper table, young lady! I 
hope you like baseball. I&#39;ll be down in a few 
minutes to rescue you, ok?&quot;
  Rei made a sour face and stuck her lower lip 
out, but Ikuko pointed emphatically at the door. 
  Usagi tried to laugh, but a deep painful cough 
came out instead. 
  Rei squeezed her hand under the bedding, and 
wished she could crawl in and keep Usagi warm. 
Her teeth still chattered, even with all the 
bedding over her. 
  Rei whispered close to Usagi&#39;s ear. 
  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Usa. I wish it were me in this 
condition instead of you! I&#39;ll be back soon, and 
in the name of Mars, I&#39;ll keep you warm.&quot; 
  Usagi smiled at her, she had no doubt Rei 
meant just that! 
  Rei left Usagi&#39;s room with regret.
  Ikuko popped a thermometer into her daughter&#39;s 
mouth then busied herself around the room. She 
closed the open window first. The heat of the 
day had rapidly been replaced by a much cooler 
night. She closed the cotton curtains so the 
light would not disturb her Usagi&#39;s much needed 
rest. 
  Ikuko pulled a spare quilt down from the 
cupboard and put it at the foot of the bed. She 
checked her watch, and sat on the edge of the 
bed near Usagi&#39;s chest. 
  Usagi struggled to keep the thermometer still 
in her mouth so Ikuko held it for her. She 
stroked Usagi&#39;s bangs out of her eyes with her 
other hand and watched as her daughter relaxed a 
bit.
  &quot;Coach Kennin called to apologize for his 
behavior towards you today. He thought 
afterwards that you might have been sick, 
though, he hoped you weren&#39;t. He said his team 
resembled poisoned flies. 
  I told him he could consider you a poisoned 
fly.&quot; Ikuko grinned impishly. 
  She checked her watch again and pulled the 
thermometer out from Usagi&#39;s lips. Ikuko stared 
at the 102&deg;.
  &quot;Well, you are definitely sick and you&#39;re not 
to leave this bed except to use the bathroom! I 
don&#39;t want an entourage of friends through here, 
either. Honestly, Bunny, you run the highest 
fevers so quickly. You might stand a better 
chance at fighting them if you had a little 
fat!&quot; 
  Tears pricked Usagi&#39;s eyes.
  &quot;I can&#39;t help it. My coaches put me on a 
&#39;health food&#39; diet and scared all the fat away. 
  Will you let Rei stay for a while, please, 
Mom?&quot; Usagi wanted Rei&#39;s warmth badly.
  &quot;If Rei wants to stay, I&#39;ll let her. With you 
sick, I could use the help. It seems she&#39;s 
closer than a sister to you, and is practically 
family anyway. 
  Do you think can you sit up for me and eat a 
little bit of food for me? Your medicine needs 
to be taken with food and plenty of fluids. I 
need to tend to the rest of the family right 
now, so you be a good girl and eat this food. I 
think it has cooled enough.&quot; 
  Usagi nodded.
  Her mother arranged the pillows to help prop 
her up. 
  Usagi&#39;s throat hurt and didn&#39;t feel too 
hungry, but she obeyed her mother. She took her 
medicine, and couple of pills to reduce her 
fever with water. The herbal tea made Usagi&#39;s 
throat feel better and helped to ease the 
tightness in her chest, so she drank it all. 
  She lay back on the pillows and sighed. 
  Her mother came back a little while later to 
take the tray.  
  &quot;Thank you for supper, Mom.&quot; Usagi smiled a 
little.
  &quot;Um, do you remember when I called you about 
Rei yesterday?&quot; 
  Ikuko nodded. 
  &quot;Hai, did you give her what I told you to?&quot;
  Usagi hesitated slightly.
  &quot;I tried, but I couldn&#39;t find all of the 
ingredients. I&#39;m worried about her. She still 
has a hard time with food, and I can&#39;t help her 
while I&#39;m like this, so I need you to help her. 
She will never come to you and admit she needs 
anything.&quot; 
  Usagi closed her eyes tiredly. 
  &quot;I think I&#39;d like to rest, now, please.&quot;
  Ikuko patted her girl&#39;s hand.
  &quot;Of course, dear, and you are welcomed for 
dinner. I&#39;ll take care of Rei for you, she 
certainly didn&#39;t eat very much at supper. All of 
us thought it was just to be polite. Shingo 
wanted to know if we could trade you in for Rei! 
  I&#39;ll have her bring some ice bags up for you. 
Your temperature is a little high. I think you&#39;d 
prefer her company over your boring old mom&#39;s, 
ne?&quot;
  Usagi smiled slightly. 
  &quot;You&#39;re not old, Mom.&quot;
  Ikuko tweaked Usagi&#39;s ear. 
  &quot;I love you too, imp!&quot; Ikuko kissed her 
daughter&#39;s hot forehead, picked up the tray and 
left the room. 
  She left the door ajar. 
  Ikuko passed Shingo in the hallway, whom at 15 
was already taller than she was. She looked up 
at his face, wagged a finger at him and barked. 
  &quot;Don&#39;t even think about teasing your sister, 
or I&#39;ll call your girlfriend and tell her 
something embarrassing about you!&quot;
  Shingo scowled at his Mom. 
  &quot;Kill joy!&quot; Moms were truly evil. 
  He peered into his sister&#39;s disaster area for 
a room, but his focus was on his sibling who 
seemed to cough non-stop. She looked and sounded 
really miserable. Shingo felt bad for her. 
  &quot;Sorry sis, hurry up and get better, so I can 
pick on you guilt-free!&quot; 
  Shingo sidestepped his mother&#39;s foot, and 
headed for his not so much neater room.

                   * * * 
  Rei suspected a little Usa-rat when Ikuko 
offered her special tea blends and soups 
throughout the course of the evening. 
  Rei didn&#39;t mind so much... her stomach did 
feel a lot better. 
  While Rei helped with the chores, Ikuko asked 
Rei if she would rather stay with them, or go on 
the yearly fall pilgrimage. 
  Rei had confided to Ikuko that it had never 
occurred to her she might be permitted to stay. 
  Grandpa was usually very adamant about 
training expeditions, also she would need a few 
things from home... like her piano, clothes, and 
some personal items. 
  Ikuko ran upstairs to check on Usagi. She had 
fallen into a fitful asleep. 
  Ikuko found Kenji in the study as he worked on 
his newspaper article. 
  &quot;Kenji, darling, could you keep an ear out for 
Usagi? 
  I need to get Rei home. If her Grandfather 
lets her, I&#39;d like for her to stay with us while 
he is on his pilgrimage. She&#39;s been under the 
weather and needs care. She needs to pick up a 
few things if she is allowed to stay.&quot; 
  Kenji mumbled his assent. 
  Ikuko kissed his only exposed cheek. 
  &quot;I&#39;ll be back shortly, and I&#39;ll keep the cell 
phone on, in case Usagi gets into trouble.
  Rei spoke to Grandpa briefly to let him know 
what had happened, and to ask his permission to 
stay with Usagi. 
  He told her the fall pilgrimage to the 
mountains the next day was important, but agreed 
that she could stay with the Tsukino&#39;s. She was 
far enough ahead in her training she could be 
spared... this once. 
  Secretly he was a little relieved. Rei needed 
a break. It seemed she had taken Yuuichiro&#39;s 
departure harder than he thought she would. 
Perhaps Usagi would keep Rei&#39;s mind off of 
herself.
  Rei thanked him, grabbed a duffle bag and 
threw some clothes and her personal items in it. 
She put her digital keyboard in its hard travel 
case. Rei ran out of the jinja, her keyboard 
grasped in one hand, and her duffle bag in the 
other. 
  Ikuko was impressed, it had taken Rei less 
than 15 minutes.
  They arrived back home in about an hour. They 
both heard Usagi&#39;s coughs as soon as they 
entered the door. Rei dropped her things at the 
front door and bolted after Ikuko four steps at 
a time. 
  Rei marveled at Ikuko. Boy, Mrs. Tsukino was 
fast. Usagi hadn&#39;t joked when she said her Mom 
could literally smell disaster and teleport 
there! They entered Usagi&#39;s room at the same 
time. She looked delirious, and her breathing 
was fast and shallow.
  &quot;Oh Rei, she&#39;s burning up! Hold her up so she 
can breathe better.&quot; Ikuko ran to the bathroom, 
and returned moments later with a thermometer.
  Rei looked at Ikuko with trepidation. 
  &quot;Ikuko Mama, she can barely breathe!&quot;
  Ikuko replied briskly.
  &quot;I hadn&#39;t planned to put it there. I want you 
to put it in the other way, while I go fix an 
herb tea that will help knock her temp down. I 
need to call Dr. Mizuno&#39;s pediatric office, and 
make up some ice bags, as well.&quot; Ikuko smiled 
pleasantly, and handed Rei the thermometer and a 
small tube of lubricant. 
   Rei sat and stared after Ikuko, her mouth 
slightly agape. She thought she heard a cackle 
as the room door closed.
   &quot;Um, Usa, your mom wants me to take your 
temp.&quot; Usagi nodded, her teeth chattered 
together against Rei&#39;s chest. 
  &quot;Um, I have to take it the other way, Baby.&quot;
  Usagi nodded again, she swallowed painfully.
  Rei lay Usagi on her side, and pulled the 
covers and the red silk underwear down. She 
lubed and inserted the thermometer with no 
protest from her victim. Usagi was too sick to 
care. 
  Rei sat against the propped up pillows, and 
gently pulled her loved one on top of her while 
she held the thermometer in place. Usagi 
shivered hard, and cuddled as close as she could 
in a feeble attempt to keep warm. Rei pulled the 
bedclothes up to cover Usagi&#39;s lower body, and 
put her free left arm snugly around her. 
  Usagi&#39;s coughs were like short barks. Rei was 
seriously worried, and prayed Ikuko would be 
gone long enough so she could funnel some of 
Mars&#39; energy into the ginsuishou. Rei 
concentrated and drew on the powers of Mars her 
sigil glowing lightly.
  &quot;Power to ginsuishou!&quot; She whispered.
  Usagi&#39;s sigil glowed faintly and the 
ginsuishou sparked to life upon her chest. 
  Rei&#39;s communicator went off seconds later and 
Rei had to trade hands to answer it. Ami&#39;s face 
appeared.
  &quot;Rei, what&#39;s going on? My computer detected 
the power from Mars being used at a low level. 
Are you in trouble?&quot; Ami asked.
  &quot;No, but Usagi is. She&#39;s real sick, and I need 
to do something to help the ginsuishou heal her. 
She is too weak and her energy level too low for 
the ginsuishou to help her effectively. I don&#39;t 
know what else to do, and I&#39;m scared. 
  I wish I had you here, Ami, I could really use 
your help, but Ikuko-Mama doesn&#39;t want a lot of 
friends in here.&quot; She added cheekily, &quot;if you 
want to help, you&#39;ll have to wait until everyone 
here goes to sleep!&quot; 
  Then more seriously, she iterated.
  &quot;Under no circumstances is anyone to call 
Usagi into battle until her fever breaks.&quot; 
  Ami nodded in affirmation, she could hear 
Usagi&#39;s coughs in the background, then her face 
blipped off of Rei&#39;s communicator.
  Meanwhile, downstairs a flurry of activity 
took place. 
  Ikuko found some herbal tea that would help 
bring down a high fever. While tea water heated, 
Ikuko whooshed into the study to discover why 
her errant husband hadn&#39;t called her. 
  Kenji&#39;s head lay upon the news article he had 
worked on. Feeling a little out of sorts... she 
left him there. 
  Shingo had been in a similar state of oblivion 
with his headsets on, bent over homework when 
Ikuko peeked into the open door. Oy. Usagi could 
have died, and they would have never known. 
  The pediatric office had already closed for 
the day, so she had to leave a message for the 
emergency doctor on rotation.
  The water boiled, and Ikuko returned to brew 
the tea. She filled some bags with ice and 
wrapped them in tea towels. 
  Ikuko raced back upstairs two at a time with 
the ice bags, and never broke a sweat. She slid 
on her socks to a halt in the hallway right in 
front of Usagi&#39;s closed door. 
  She opened the door quietly and drew her 
breath in. 
  Rei&#39;s cheek rested on the back of Usagi&#39;s 
flaxen head, which lay on her left shoulder. 
Ikuko could tell Rei&#39;s right hand cradled 
Usagi&#39;s bottom while she held the thermometer 
still, through the bedclothes. Her left arm was 
around Usagi&#39;s ribcage and she gently ran her 
fingernails soothingly along her daughter&#39;s 
spine. 
  Usagi in turn lay on top, her left arm draped 
along Rei&#39;s torso under the arm that held the 
thermometer. Her right hand rested deliberately 
on Rei&#39;s left breast, her eyes closed. 
  They clearly enjoyed their intimacy, and were 
totally unaware they had been observed. 
  Ikuko&#39;s face flushed. She wondered if they 
were actually lovers, though, the tender concern 
expressed on Rei&#39;s face spoke volumes. She 
didn&#39;t know how she felt about that. 
  She knocked and pushed the door open wider. 
  Rei looked up, captured Usagi&#39;s right hand 
with her left, and held it gently where it was. 
Rei smiled with not a trace of guilt or guile. 
  Ikuko raised an eyebrow at her.
  &quot;Is there something you need to tell me, Rei?&quot; 
Ikuko prompted. 
  &quot;Um, I love her?&quot; Rei responded questioningly.
  &quot;Does my daughter have the same inclination?&quot; 
Ikuko pressed.
  This time Usagi nodded her head. 
  Ikuko quit holding her breath and let it out 
slowly. 
  &quot;Well, this is not the time to discuss this, 
so I won&#39;t. Let&#39;s have a look at her temp.&quot; 
Ikuko directed, and pulled the bedclothes down. 
She noticed Mamoru&#39;s engagement ring was still 
in place on her daughter&#39;s left ring finger.
  Rei carefully took the thermometer out and 
wiped it off on the tissue Ikuko had handed her. 
She rocked it until she could read it and felt 
the color drain from her own face... 104&deg;. She 
silently handed it to Ikuko&#39;s patient fingers. 
Rei clothed Usagi&#39;s nakedness and pulled the 
bedding back up over the two of them. 
  Ikuko handed the ice bags to Rei just as 
silently.
  &quot;Here, Rei, put these under her arms and 
between her legs. All we can do is wait, and 
make her as comfortable as possible, until the 
doctor&#39;s office calls back.&quot;
  Ikuko excused herself from the room to go 
retrieve the steeped tea. Ikuko closed the door 
and her fingers trembled on the knob. She rested 
her forehead on the doorframe, and wept. She was 
never more confused in her life, what had 
happened to her usually open daughter? For the 
first time in 18 years, Ikuko felt like a 
stranger to her daughter. Usagi&#39;s fever 
terrified her even more.
  The minute Ikuko left, Rei resumed her energy 
donation to Usagi. The girl was seriously ill, 
and it wasn&#39;t just a little cold. She slipped in 
out of consciousness and delirium. Rei tried 
hard not to freak out and was still convinced 
Usagi needed an IV and a catheter.

                   * * *           
  Ikuko knocked on the door and let herself in. 
She could have sworn she saw Rei&#39;s forehead 
glow. She decided that she must be so tired and 
traumatized over Usagi, she simply hallucinated. 
  Ikuko shook her head to clear her mind and 
brought the special herb tea over to Usagi&#39;s 
bedside. She woke her with difficulty and held 
the teacup to Usagi&#39;s lips.
  &quot;Here, Bunny, this tastes bitter, but it 
should help you to feel better a little more 
quickly.&quot;
  Usagi sipped it with wry expression and 
croaked. 
  &quot;This better be worth it, or I&#39;ll tell Luna to 
hide her lizard tails under your pillow!&quot; 
  Ikuko blanched. 
  &quot;You wouldn&#39;t! Where is that cat, anyway?&quot;
  Usagi couldn&#39;t tell her mom Luna was doing 
some research with Artemis, so she quipped. 
  &quot;I saw her with Mina&#39;s cat, Artemis. They&#39;re 
probably on a secret search for alien rats with 
mysterious powers and an evil agenda, or, maybe 
they seek to overthrow the great lizard king who 
garners the most prized tails.&quot; 
  Usagi coughed and took another sip of tea. 
  Finishing the cup, she lay her head down on 
Rei&#39;s quivering right shoulder, her forehead 
resting comfortably on Rei&#39;s neck.
  Ikuko watched them in uneasy silence a few 
moments. Rei still had mirth written all over 
her face.
  She sighed audibly. If Rei wanted to sleep in 
an uncomfortable upright position so Usagi could 
breathe better all night, Ikuko decided she 
would not fight it. It seemed Rei had appointed 
herself bodyguard over her daughter.
  Usagi had already passed out again.
  &quot;Rei, that child either has the most 
outrageous imagination, or she&#39;s delirious. 
Please shout if you notice any changes in her 
temperature or behavior. I&#39;ll be back around 
midnight to check on you both and to give her 
some aspirin. I hope you can get some sleep, 
Rei.&quot; Ikuko swept Rei&#39;s bangs away from her 
forehead and planted a warm &#39;mom&#39; kiss there. 
  &quot;Thank you for your love and care of my 
impetuous Bunny. You truly are a gem!&quot;
  Rei smiled shyly in thanks. She relaxed as 
soon as Ikuko left the room. She closed her 
eyes, and with her sigil aglow, she prepared her 
mind for rest. 
  Rei&#39;s rest eluded her, though, as she held 
Usagi close in fear. She suffered in silence as 
Usagi&#39;s body jarred with coughs and shook with 
fever. She wept silently as Usagi cried out, 
&#39;nooo... mother... don&#39;t leave me&#39;, or screamed, 
&#39;stop... you&#39;re killing them... not Rei, 
please... not Rei... take me&#39;, or moaned &#39;God... 
help me... can&#39;t do it... alone&#39;, and begged, 
&#39;please stop Mamo... don&#39;t hurt me... you&#39;re 
hurting me... Mamo...&#39;. Rei&#39;s shoulder was 
soaked with sweat and tears.
  Ikuko returned as promised around midnight to 
a relatively quiet room, save for Usagi&#39;s heavy, 
rapid, shallow breaths. Rei&#39;s forehead was 
covered by thick dark bangs that fell onto 
closed eyes. 
  Ikuko turned a small desk lamp on, and Rei 
stirred. She came over to the bedside and set a 
cup of water, two aspirins, and a thermometer 
down beside the warm ice bags on the bedside 
table. 
  She brushed Rei&#39;s bangs from her eyes briefly 
touched her forehead to make sure Usagi&#39;s 
illness hadn&#39;t affected her, too. 
  Rei smiled shyly.
  &quot;I&#39;m fine, Mrs. Tsukino, thank you. I&#39;m a bit 
smooshed, though... I would kill for some water,
toothpaste, and a nightgown! Can you hold down 
the fort?&quot; 
  Ikuko smiled back. 
  &quot;Of course!&quot; She turned the covers down. 
  Rei gathered Usagi up and slid gently out from 
under her. 
  Ikuko chuckled as Rei bolted for the door. 
  Her attention was brought back to her daughter 
when she mewled. Ikuko had shifted her again and 
placed her on her side. Every jostle seemed to 
hurt her. Ikuko put the thermometer in. She held 
Usagi&#39;s wrist for a count and then held her hand 
while she waited a few more minutes. 
  Rei returned to the room, with her duffle bag 
in hand, just as Ikuko read the thermometer.
  Ikuko noted that Rei had dressed for bed. She 
wore a long royal purple silk gown which seemed 
to accentuate her attributes. Rei&#39;s silken ebony 
tresses were lustrously brushed. Her unusual 
large clear purple amethyst eyes, were framed by 
beautiful long black lashes, and glittered like 
gems.
  Ikuko blinked at Rei. Goodness! She was 
certainly elegant in that gown... but then, Rei 
could probably make a potato sack look good!  
  Rei felt much more refreshed, and her neat 
pearly teeth flashed engagingly for a moment as 
she hoped for a miracle. 
  Ikuko dispelled the smile with a look.
  &quot;Her temperature hasn&#39;t come down hardly at 
all. It&#39;s still hovering around 104&deg;. Nothing 
seems to be working, and she&#39;s being such a 
trooper... she&#39;s fighting so hard!&quot; 
  Ikuko&#39;s voice quavered. Rei rushed to her side 
and held Ikuko as she cried.
  &quot;Ikuko Mama, the medicine is working, she 
hasn&#39;t been like this long. I was going to call 
you, but you were already up. I was just resting 
when you came in. Lets get the aspirin into her, 
and I&#39;ll carry her to the bathroom if she needs 
it, all right? She needs her Mom right now to be 
strong and to help her fight.&quot;
  Ikuko dried her tears. 
  &quot;You&#39;re right. Sit her up please, Rei, she&#39;s 
too heavy for me. She may be skinny, but what 
she has is all meat... just like you!&quot;
  Usagi mewled again as Rei lifted her into an 
upright position then coughed so hard she 
retched. 
  Rei rubbed her chest and hoped Usagi could 
hang onto her food. She gently whisked the tears 
away. 
  &quot;Here sweetie, take these so you&#39;ll feel 
better.&quot; Ikuko implored, and held the pills out 
for Usagi to take. 
  Usagi drank the water thirstily, and ignored 
how much it hurt. 
  Rei grinned mischievously.
  &quot;So, are you floating yet?&quot; Rei asked. 
  Usagi nodded. 
  &quot;Want me to carry you?&quot; Usagi nodded again.
  Rei picked her up carefully, and when they got 
back, Ikuko was gone. Rei sat on the edge of the 
bed and held her unconscious princess close. She 
murmured words of encouragement and love between 
kisses on her forehead. 
  That&#39;s what Ikuko walked in on with fresh, 
cold ice bags. Her breath caught and she cleared 
her throat. 
  &quot;Here Rei, climb back in and use these. The 
office called back and said both of their 
doctors had gotten called into the emergency 
room at the hospital, and I could take Usagi 
there as a last resort... they were swamped. She 
told me they scheduled Usagi for their first 
appointment at 8am. in the morning.&quot; Ikuko 
sighed.
  &quot;At 4am, she needs another dose of her 
antibiotic, I&#39;m going to try to get some sleep 
now, and so should you.&quot; Ikuko brushed Rei&#39;s 
tears from her cheeks and left the two alone.
