&#147;I can hardly wait.&#148; Two little brunettes press their faces to the 
window at the same time.

&#147;I know what you mean.&#148; The girl, about eight or nine, comments. &#147;I 
wonder how they stay up there. They&#146;re so...big.&#148;

&#147;They must way a ton.&#148; The little boy turns to the girl and grins. He 
was possibly ten at the time. &#147;I&#146;m Makoto.&#148; The boy sticks his hand 
out.

&#147;Really?&#148; The girl blinks her emerald eyes. &#147;But I&#146;m Makoto. Ah...just 
call me Mako.&#148; She reaches up and touches Makoto&#146;s charcoal hair. &#147;So 
you&#146;re like...my counter part?&#148; The boy laughs.

&#147;Maybe.&#148; He looks at the girl, fascinated by her eyes. &#147;You have 
pretty eyes, Mako.&#148;

&#147;I would say the same for you,&#148; She flings her hair over her shoulder 
and smirks. &#147;If it were true.&#148; She and the boy share a laugh before 
taking seats next to each other. &#147;So you&#146;re French?&#148;

&#147;Yep. My sister&#146;s British, but she doesn&#146;t sound like it.&#148; The boy 
pulls his tie off and hands it to Makoto. &#147;How&#146;d you tell?&#148;

&#147;Your accent. Didn&#146;t recognize it, so I guessed.&#148; Makoto shrugs. She 
accepts the yellow plaid tie with great amusement. &#147;Thanks. I 
think...&#148; She puts it around her neck, feels around then hands him her 
ticket. &#147;I&#146;m not sure what else to give you.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t have to give me anything.&#148; He tries to hand it back but she 
refuses. &#147;Well...how about your burette?&#148;

&#147;All right.&#148; She takes it off and hands it to Makoto. &#147;Here.&#148; 

&#147;My memento of my other self.&#148; He ties back his hair into an unusual 
ponytail. Makoto laughs and redoes it, making it look a little better.

&#147;You kinda look like me.&#148; Makoto comments with a cocky grin on her 
face. &#147;If you&#146;re French and your sister&#146;s British...what happened?&#148;

&#147;Parents&#146; marriage didn&#146;t work so my father brought me back to 
France.&#148; Makoto shrugs and puts his tickets down on the seats. &#147;My 
younger sister stayed in England with my mother but they&#146;re talking 
about moving. That&#146;s why I&#146;m going there.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148; Makoto sits back uncomfortably. &#147;I didn&#146;t mean-&#147;

&#147;It&#146;s alright &#145;Koko&#146;.&#148; Makoto grins at the irony of it. &#147;Well, I kind 
of got lost earlier-&#147;

&#147;Me too.&#148; Makoto grins sheepishly, ignoring the insult. &#147;But I just 
had to see the planes take off.&#148;

&#147;Me too. Well...I should get going.&#148; He takes one ticket and pushes 
himself off the seat. &#147;You&#146;re a cool kid, Makoto.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not a kid.&#148; Makoto replies indignantly. She pushes off her seat 
and takes the other ticket. &#147;I&#146;m sure your sister&#146;s a cool one too. 
Tell her I said hi.&#148; After saying their goodbyes, both Makoto&#146;s part 
in opposite directions. After a few minutes, our Makoto gets fed up 
with being lost and decides to ask someone for help. &#147;E-excuse me 
but...I&#146;m lost and need some help finding, ah...the proper gate.&#148;

&#147;Makoto!&#148; A man yells. He rushes over and turns her around. &#147;Your not 
Makoto...&#148;

&#147;Yes, sir. I am.&#148; She hands him her ticket to prove it. &#147;Kino Makoto.&#148; 
He reads the ticket over a few times.

&#147;Oh, God.&#148; His face goes pale. &#147;This is my son&#146;s ticket.&#148; He drops the 
ticket and takes both her shoulders. &#147;Where&#146;s your flight going?&#148;

&#147;I-I&#146;m not sure.&#148; Makoto pulls away, frightened tears in her eyes. &#147;It 
was a surprise from my parents-&#147;

&#147;No.&#148; The man shakes his head and takes off running. &#147;I can&#146;t lose 
him!&#148;

&#147;Makoto...&#148; Makoto kneels down, picks up the ticket and takes off into 
an all-out run. She runs back to where they met and watches her plane 
take off. She looks down at the ticket to read the name but-

BOOM!! The plane blows up. Makoto watches in horror as the plane&#146;s 
wing takes fire. The first engine blows, then the next. Suddenly the 
glass shatters and Makoto is thrown off her feet and rendered 
unconscious. The last thing she saw were the plane&#146;s parts falling to 
the ground, burning. Then everything went black.

25 August 2003

Makoto wakes up covered in sweat. She wipes her tears away and 
collapses back into bed. She glances over at her clock. It was only 
3:43 a.m. which meant if she went back to sleep, she&#146;ll have an even 
harder time sleeping tonight. If she stayed up, she&#146;ll be grumpy and 
her friends will ask what&#146;s wrong. 

Makoto pushes the blankets back and sits up. &#145;It&#146;d be better if it was 
only one day.&#148; She just blows out a breath and stands up. She makes 
her bed, sets out her hand-made uniform and takes off down the hall 
and into the bathroom.

@;-&gt;--

&#145;Makoto...&#146; Makoto blinks back tears and looks around. School had gone 
by painstakingly slow and instead of being rude like she thought she 
would be. Instead she had gone into silence. 

/I can&#146;t lose him!/

Makoto gently rocks back and forth, ignoring her friends&#146; concerns. 
&#145;What was his name!&#146; She shakes herself out of it. &#147;Sorry, what?&#148;

&#147;I asked if you&#146;re alright.&#148; Minako leans forward and gently lays her 
hand on Makoto&#146;s forehead. &#147;Obviously, you&#146;re not.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m alright.&#148; She smacks Minako&#146;s hand away. &#147;I haven&#146;t had much 
sleep last night.&#148; She snaps. Makoto runs a hand over her face and 
sighs. &#147;Sorry. It&#146;s because of that that my mind wanders. It&#146;s not 
always pleasant.&#148; Makoto grins tiredly and scratches her cheek.

&#147;I&#146;ll take you home, then.&#148; Makoto turns to see Ami putting her books 
away. &#147;I&#146;m sure the other girls won&#146;t mind.&#148; She stands up slowly and 
puts her bag over her shoulder. &#147;Will they?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Rei shakes her head before turning back to her book.

&#147;No...&#148; Minako agrees, somewhat reluctantly.

&#147;Aww... You&#146;re just-OWE!&#148; Usagi&#146;s face goes blue. She doubles over and 
rests her forehead on the table. &#147;No...&#148; Her voice wavers. Ami sends 
Usagi a sympathetic look. Rei had done that to her, too.

&#147;Alright.&#148; Makoto starts cleaning up her space, ordering her papers, 
straightening her books, and putting them in her bag. She stands up 
shakily and waves goodbye. Walking out the door, she stumbles. 
Deciding it best, she leans on the wall and continues to walk. Behind 
her, she could hear the others already speculating about her 
condition. She grins tiredly again and pushes away from the wall. She 
walks a little more steadily towards the stairs. Thinking it better, 
she makes her way beside the stairs and walks down the slope. &#147;Hey, 
Ami?&#148;

&#147;Yeah?&#148; 

Makoto looks down at her and blinks. &#145;When did she do that?&#146; Ami had 
her arm wrapped around Makoto&#146;s waist to keep her steady. If Makoto 
weren&#146;t already blushing...Makoto grins oddly. &#147;In all the years we&#146;ve 
known each other you never told me when you&#146;re birthday was.&#148;

&#147;...It&#146;s not that I&#146;m shy, Mako.&#148; Ami carefully leads Makoto to the 
bus stop and sits her down. She quickly checks her temperature. 
&#147;You&#146;re really hot.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t really think so.&#148; Makoto shakes her head, exaggeratedly. 
&#147;I&#146;ve always thought I looked more like a boy.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s not true.&#148; Ami giggles. She spots the bus and pulls out her 
purse. &#147;And that&#146;s not what I meant.&#148; Seeing she has enough, Ami pulls 
Makoto to her feet and wraps her arm around her waist. &#147;You&#146;re a 
very...&#148; A light blush creeps across Ami&#146;s face. &#147;Attractive woman, 
Makoto.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m taking you home.&#148; Ami pays the fair and sits down beside Makoto, 
doing her best not to blush. &#147;You&#146;ve got a fever, Makoto.&#148;

&#147;No, I&#146;m just...&#148; Makoto shakes her head. She looks around the bus, 
frowning. &#147;Okay...&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Nothing...&#148; Makoto blinks back tears. She leans over and rests her 
head on top of Ami&#146;s. &#147;I&#146;m just tired.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t go to sleep yet.&#148; Ami shakes her lightly. &#147;Not until we get to 
your house.&#148; 

&#147;Hm kay.&#148; Makoto sits up straighter and shakes her head. &#147;Not until we 
get to our house.&#148; Makoto looks down at Ami through glazed eyes. &#147;You 
look very familiar.&#148;

&#147;Makoto.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s alright, Ami.&#148; Makoto grins, settling Ami at ease.

&#147;Geez. Don&#146;t do that.&#148; Ami pats her chest, right above her heart.

&#147;I&#146;m just saying you look very familiar. Like I&#146;ve met you before.&#148; 
Makoto reaches up and touches Ami&#146;s hair. 

&#147;Makoto,&#148; Ami grins, moving her face into Makoto&#146;s hand. &#147;We&#146;ve known 
each other for four years and a life time before that. Of course I 
look familiar.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re probably right.&#148; Makoto strokes Ami&#146;s cheek gently before 
pulling away. &#147;Anyway. Isn&#146;t your mother getting the night off?&#148;

&#147;Yeah...&#148; Ami sighs. She barely ever got to see her mother. At least 
when she was awake. &#147;But I&#146;m positive she&#146;ll understand.&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Makoto shakes her head. &#147;I&#146;m not going to get in the way of you 
and your mother.&#148; She takes her bag and stands up. The bus stops and 
she goes stumbling face first. 

&#147;Makoto!&#148; Ami reaches out to break Makoto&#146;s fall. Instead, she just 
goes down with her. Ami giggles nervously, looking up into Makoto&#146;s 
glazed eyes. Makoto was presently lying half on top of Ami, looking 
down. &#147;Ah heh...hi.&#148;

&#147;Hi...&#148; Another sleepy grin crosses Makoto&#146;s face. &#147;I...our stop&#146;s 
coming up.&#148; Makoto stands up slowly and collapses in the chair. Ami on 
the other hand, stayed on the floor, collecting her thoughts and her 
composure. Once successful, she gets to her feet.

Ami silently helps Makoto to her feet. She wraps her arm around her 
waist and they exit the bus together. They walk down the street, 
towards Makoto&#146;s apartment. Ami presses the button and waits, in 
silence, for them to get to Makoto&#146;s floor. The doors open and Ami 
lead Makoto down the hall. &#147;Where&#146;s your spare?&#148;

&#147;My spare?&#148; Makoto looks at Ami blankly.

&#147;Never mind.&#148; Ami reaches into Makoto&#146;s hidden pocket and feels 
around. Blushing furiously, Ami pulls out a set of keys. &#147;Got them.&#148;

&#147;I noticed.&#148; 

Ami looks back at Makoto&#146;s red face. Maybe part of that was a blush. 
Ami turns back to the door and tries a key at random. She was smiling. 
Ami opens the door and tries to sober up. &#147;Come on.&#148; She takes Makoto 
by the waist and leads her to the bedroom. &#147;I&#146;m here, Makoto.&#148;

&#147;Thank you.&#148; Tears well up in Makoto&#146;s eyes. But this time, she didn&#146;t 
try to blink them back. Even through her fever-ridden phase, Makoto 
was able to catch the double meaning.

&#147;It&#146;s alright, Mako.&#148; Ami crawls onto the bed and takes Makoto into 
her arms. &#147;Just let it all out.&#148;

@;-&gt;--

26 August 2003

&#147;She&#146;s got a really bad fever, mom.&#148; Ami whispers into the phone. &#147;She 
may even be delusional.&#148;

&#147;Just calm down, Ami.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m trying.&#148; Ami runs a hand through her hair and sighs. &#147;But she&#146;s 
my friend.&#148;

&#147;I understand that, Ami. I really do.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve been able to keep calm when she&#146;s around but once she&#146;s gone, I 
just... can&#146;t.&#148; Ami waits for her mother to say something, good or 
bad.

&#147;What&#146;s she doing now?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve got her sleeping.&#148; Ami looks down at Makoto. They were on the 
bed right now. Both of them. &#147;I&#146;ve been treating her fever and it 
seems to have gone down. But when she&#146;s awake she rambles.&#148;

&#147;What does she say?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not sure I understand, though.&#148; Feeling calmer, Ami starts 
brushing Makoto&#146;s hair. &#147;She keeps talking about her parents and 
herself.&#148;

&#147;Herself?&#148;

&#147;I think so.&#148; Ami traces Makoto&#146;s jaw, then her lips. &#147;Who&#146;s Makoto?&#148; 
She whispers. Makoto&#146;s eyes open slowly. 

&#147;Hm?&#148;

&#147;How are you feeling?&#148; Ami moves the phone so her mother could hear. 

&#147;I could get used to waking up to you.&#148; Makoto rests her head back on 
Ami&#146;s chest; both obviously make Ami blush. &#147;How&#146;s my fever?&#148;

&#147;B-better.&#148; Ami shifts her position and wraps her free arm around 
Makoto&#146;s shoulders. &#147;How are you feeling?&#148;

&#147;Dizzy. Light headed. And...Ah, Aims?&#148;

&#147;Yeah?&#148;

&#147;This is my room, right?&#148; Makoto glances around the room. Her gaze 
falls on a spider plant. &#147;Never mind.&#148; She shakes her head and closes 
her eyes. &#147;I&#146;m sorry...&#148; She whispers.

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;Makoto...&#148; Makoto begins to ramble again about the night of the 
crash.

&#147;See?&#148; Ami watches the sad expression and wipes the tears off of her 
own face. &#147;I don&#146;t know what to do when that happens.&#148;

&#147;Is she still awake?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Ami kisses the top of Makoto&#146;s head. &#147;She&#146;s been like this since 
last night.&#148;

&#147;Hm...My offer to come over is still open.&#148;

&#147;...Just wait.&#148; Ami sets the phone down on the bed, so her mother 
can&#146;t hear her. &#147;Makoto.&#148; She shakes her sleeping friend by the 
shoulders. Ami leans over and whispers into Makoto&#146;s ear. &#147;Please wake 
up. Please?&#148; 

&#147;Hm...&#148; Makoto&#146;s face contorts. It takes on a painful expression 
before peace takes over. Makoto opens her eyes slowly and looks up 
into Ami&#146;s. &#147;Why are you crying?&#148; Makoto reaches up and wipes Ami&#146;s 
tears. 

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148; Ami moves out of Makoto&#146;s grip and looks away.

&#147;Don&#146;t be Ami.&#148; Makoto sits up and rubs Ami&#146;s back. &#147;Please tell me?&#148;

&#147;My mother wants to come here.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s not why you&#146;re crying.&#148; Makoto moves closer and rests her head 
on Ami&#146;s shoulder.

&#147;I...I&#146;m not sure.&#148; Ami looks down at Makoto. &#147;She&#146;ll only come if you 
want her to.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s your mother, Ami. I&#146;d really like to meet her.&#148; Makoto looks 
down at her wrinkly uniform in disgust. &#147;Just let me take a shower 
then I think I&#146;ll make...&#148; Makoto glances at her clock. &#147;An American 
dish. It&#146;s simple really. Just pour the macaroni into the pot, add 
three cups of water. Wait until...&#148; Makoto looks up into Ami&#146;s smiling 
face. &#147;I&#146;ll take a shower first.&#148;

&#147;Alright.&#148; Ami watches Makoto get out of bed and make her way out of 
the room. The only time Makoto really feels good is when she&#146;s in the 
kitchen. Maybe this will do her good. She picks up the phone and 
brings it to her ear. &#147;Come by in one hour. I think She&#146;ll feel better 
by then.&#148;

&#147;If she&#146;ll feel better-&#147;

&#147;She said she&#146;d like to meet you.&#148; Ami smiles.</pre>
