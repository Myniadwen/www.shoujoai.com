<h1>Absence (part 7 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Minako Aino yawned and stretched her arms, letting out a small moan as 
the muscles ached. She then knuckled her back, trying to work out the 
uncomfortable kinks. Hospital seats certainly didn&#39;t do much for a 
person&#146;s comfort. The Senshi of Love sighed and looked at the clock on 
the wall nearby. It was just going off two in the morning. Great... and 
on a school night too. It seemed that every night these days was a late 
one. She hoped her parents were both sound asleep and, with any luck, 
hadn&#39;t bothered to check up on her by peeking into her bedroom at home. 
If Minako&#146;s parents caught her out at this hour, they would probably 
think she was partying or something. Nothing could have been further 
from the truth.

Minako slouched back in her plastic chair. She wished she was partying 
and not waiting to hear if one of her friends was going to see tomorrow 
or not. The blonde looked up and watched Haruka pace past her for what 
had to be the fiftieth time that night, the woman&#146;s expression a grim 
rictus. She couldn&#39;t imagine what was going through her friend&#146;s mind. 
She didn&#39;t know what it was like to have the one you loved most hanging 
onto life by just a thread and could do nothing to help her... except 
simply pray. But it was the waiting; that&#39;s what really got to you. Your 
mind would come up with dozens of different scenarios, each one worse 
than the last... but sometimes... sometimes even they couldn&#146;t compare 
to reality.

Minako remembered what it had been like waiting for Rei to be dug out of 
the collapsed clothing store, only slightly more than a week ago. After 
hearing what Rei had done from a distraught Usagi, Minako had clung to 
the hope that the miko had somehow made it out all right... or she at 
least had miraculously survived the cave in and would be found alive. 
They had been through so much together, faced so many dangers... it had 
never occurred to the Senshi of Love that one of the Sailors could 
die... and for good. Even when Rei couldn&#39;t be found, Minako had still 
believed that the Fire Senshi was alive and well; that she had, by some 
means, escaped the building on her own. But that belief had dimmed with 
every passing day....

Minako looked over to where Usagi and Mamoru were sitting next to one 
another. The couple appeared so worn out. Usagi hadn&#146;t been the same 
after Rei&#39;s death. It seemed her carefree spirit had died with the Fire 
Senshi. She was just so... serious... as if a bleakness and filled her 
heart and soul. Minako couldn&#39;t even remember if she had seen the girl 
smile once since the incident. She supposed that Usagi blamed herself 
for the loss of Rei, despite all of her friends&#146; earnest words to the 
contrary, and that was the reason for her new behaviour. It would be so 
like Usagi.

While the Moon Princess had always cared about the wellbeing of her 
fellow Sailors, she had now become extremely protective of them... 
overprotective. She didn&#39;t even call for help when she encountered a 
youma anymore, preferring to face it, or them, alone. There had been too 
many times that Mamoru had had to save the girl from a fight against 
impossible odds. Usagi just wouldn&#39;t let the Sailor Senshi, or anyone, 
protect her any longer. Nothing seemed to get through to her, not even 
Mamoru, regardless of his efforts.

The youma... they had made the night theirs. There was hardly ever a 
night when there wasn&#146;t youma activity to deal with. Minako had lost 
count of the number of skirmishes she had been in. No matter how many 
youma the Sailor Senshi destroyed, their numbers remained strong; they 
simply just kept coming. It wasn&#39;t fair. How could there be so many in 
Tokyo? Where were they all coming from? The youma didn&#39;t always travel 
alone, either, they appeared in groups... sometimes just as a pair, 
sometimes up to five. Those battles were always the most brutal. Minako 
constantly had some sort of injury on her body now. She got the 
impression that her parents even thought she was getting bullied at 
school with all of the bruises and half-healed cuts seen on her... The 
Senshi of Love smiled bitterly. If it were only that.

Minako&#146;s tired blue gaze moved on to Ami and Makoto. Ami was asleep, her 
head resting on the taller girl&#39;s lap. Makoto idly stroked her fingers 
through the geniuses&#146; short blue hair, her rhythmic caresses seeming to 
help keep the girl in her state of peaceful slumber. At least those two 
were still keeping it together, which was a good thing considering the 
state Usagi and Mamoru were in.

After what had happened to Michiru, Minako wasn&#146;t sure what Haruka was 
going to be like. If the Senshi of the Sea didn&#146;t recover... Minako put 
her elbows on her knees and rested her head in her hands, closing her 
eyes tightly. How had things gotten so bad? Ever since Rei... ever since 
then, everything had slowly fallen apart. If Michiru were to... to 
die... No. No way the Sailor Senshi would be able to handle another loss 
like that. Morale was already shot to pieces; a second senshi, a second 
*friend* dying would just be too much. Minako took deep shuddering 
breaths as she fought to keep the tears back. She knew if she were to 
start crying, she wouldn&#39;t be able to stop.

&quot;Ms. Ten&#39;ou?&quot;

Minako quickly wiped her brimming eyes and looked up to see that Dr. 
Mizuno had emerged from the operating theatre, still dressed in her 
surgery gown.

Haruka had immediately ceased her pacing at the sound of her name and 
whirled around to look at the doctor, half in hope, half in fear.

&quot;We&#39;ve managed to stabilize her,&quot; said Dr. Mizuno, causing Haruka to let 
go of the breath she had been holding. &quot;There was extensive internal 
bleeding... but we were successful in stopping it.&quot;

&quot;Is she going to be okay?&quot; asked Haruka worriedly.

&quot;In time I believe she will make a full recovery,&quot; Dr. Mizuno said 
confidently.

Haruka lowered her head and closed her eyes. &quot;Good... that&#39;s... good,&quot; 
she said quietly, barely above a whisper. After taking a moment to calm 
her nerves, she opened her eyes and raised her head to the doctor again. 
&quot;May I see her now?&quot; she then asked in a louder, stronger voice.

&quot;She&#39;s in recovery at the moment, but you can wait in her room if you 
wish,&quot; Dr. Mizuno answered with an understanding smile, gesturing to a 
hallway to her left with a hand. Haruka nodded in acceptance and then 
turned back to her friends.

&quot;It&#39;s alright Haruka; you should see her alone,&quot; Makoto said 
sympathetically.

Haruka nodded again and gave a strained smile. &quot;You guys should go home 
and get some sleep... you all look like you need it,&quot; she said, before 
glancing at the snoozing Ami. &quot;Well, almost all....&quot;

Minako watched as Haruka and Ami&#39;s mother walked away down the hall, 
before disappearing down an intersecting corridor. So Michiru was going 
to be fine... eventually. The Senshi of Love exhaled heavily, the relief 
she was feeling almost a tangible thing. It certainly was a weight off 
of her shoulders. Minako rubbed her red, weary eyes. She had better take 
Haruka&#146;s advice; she felt exhausted.

&quot;We&#39;ll make them pay for what they&#39;ve done,&quot; growled Makoto, catching 
Minako&#146;s attention. &quot;We&#39;ll find the source of these things and cut it 
off. Whoever&#39;s controlling the youma will find out what happens when you 
hurt one of our friends!&quot;

Minako smiled a little. Makoto was always trying to keep their spirits 
up. The problem was, with their current technology, they couldn&#39;t find 
any source... and each youma they had managed to question, seemed 
utterly and completely loyal to their so-called &#39;mistress&#39;. It wouldn&#39;t 
give up any information. Haruka had suggested capturing one of the 
creatures and torturing it until it talked... but it hadn&#146;t quite come 
to that yet. Thankfully. However, Minako wasn&#146;t too sure if she and the 
other senshi could avoid preforming such... unpleasant... measures if 
things continued as they were now. Their sensibilities were secondary to 
the safety of the city and to the Earth.

Ami stirred on Makoto&#39;s lap, the brunette&#146;s rousing declaration no doubt 
disturbing her nap. She blinked in confusion for second before realising 
where she was exactly and sat up. Haruka was missing. &quot;Oh! Is Michiru 
alright?&quot; Ami instantly inquired, looking anxiously between her friends&#39; 
fatigued faces and trying to gauge their expressions for any signs of 
grief.

Makoto smiled at the blue-haired girl, dispelling her fears. &quot;She&#39;s 
going to be fine,&quot; the taller girl assured her friend.

&quot;I knew my mother wouldn&#39;t let her down,&quot; Ami sighed in relief.

Minako let out a sigh of her own. Things were bad. With Sailor Neptune 
out of commission for the foreseeable future, they were down to five 
Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen. She really didn&#39;t want to have to call 
Hotaru or Chibi-Usa into battle. While they could fight --Hotaru 
especially-- seeing them get injured... no. Six would be enough to 
continue to patrol the night and beat back the multitude of prowling 
youma. It had to be.

******

Sailor Mars travelled quickly through the shadows of the night like a 
ghost. She was fully aware that something... no... someone was following 
her and that the person was no expert in the art of stealth. It was 
probably just one of the surviving thugs... but for what reason he would 
be tailing her, she had no idea. Mars smirked. Perhaps he wanted the 
Fire Senshi to join their gang. But enough was enough. Sailor Mars 
swiftly took a detour into a nearby alleyway, flitting into the darkness 
and effectively vanishing from sight... and then waited.

******

Sanjuro stopped chasing after the mysterious woman and leaned against a 
wall to catch his breath. Man, did she ever move fast. Sanjuro wasn&#146;t 
cut out for this kind of strenuous activity. He held onto the camera 
around his neck tightly while he rested, as if it were more precious 
than gold to him. But in a sense, it was. The photos he had taken back 
at the warehouse had to be worth a fortune. The reporter grinned 
gleefully. The pictures inside his camera would make the front page of 
the Daily for sure!

At the moment, though, Sanjuro really wanted to know what was behind the 
mask of the black swathed hero, so he had decided to follow her as 
discreetly as he could. Plus, there was also the added bonus that if 
some homicidal maniac or ugly mutant killing machine were to attack him, 
she would be close enough to save his ass. Maybe she even had some cool 
secret hideout or something! With lots of gadgets! Sanjuro just *had* to 
get photos of all that! Ryoji was going to be spitting nails out of 
jealousy! The reporter gave a low chuckle, his mind conjuring up all 
sorts of images that would ultimately make him a rich man.

Sanjuro pushed off the wall and continued to move as quietly as he 
could. He had noticed the woman turn into a side alley before he had 
stopped for a breather. Sanjuro jogged over to the alley and pressed 
himself against the wall by the entrance. He then leaned out to take a 
peek inside... and was suddenly grabbed by two strong hands, which 
pulled him into the darkness.

&quot;Yaaah!&quot; cried out Sanjuro in fright, who was sure he was about to get 
sliced and diced by one of those creatures he had seen earlier at the 
warehouse.

Sanjuro was pushed roughly down onto a pile of soggy newspapers. He 
looked up apprehensively at the shadowy figure standing over him, 
expecting to see some horrible monster. But instead... uh oh... he had 
been caught.

&quot;Who the hell are you and why are you following me?!&quot; the masked woman 
demanded sternly, glaring down at the reporter.

&quot;I, uh... what I mean is... um...&quot; Sanjuro found it difficult to pry his 
eyes away from her outfit. It was even better close up. It conformed to 
every delicious curve of the woman&#146;s body, emphasising her figure 
delightfully. He felt a nosebleed coming on.

The woman looked down at herself and realised what Sanjuro was gawking 
at. She scowled and quickly pulled her coat tighter around her body. 
Sanjuro heard her mutter something about &quot;men&quot; and &quot;hentai&quot;.

&quot;I am about five seconds away from torching you,&quot; the black-clad figure 
declared angrily.

Sanjuro shook his head to clear his ecchi thoughts. &quot;I-I&#39;m Sanjuro 
Watanabe, from the Yokohama Daily,&quot; he then blurted out.

The woman raised an elegant raven eyebrow. &quot;A reporter...?&quot; She seemed 
to contemplate this for a second, and then stabbed a pointed finger at 
Sanjuro, causing the man to flinch. &quot;You&#39;re the one who wrote that story 
about me!&quot;

&quot;What? No! That was in the Telegraph, I&#39;m from the Daily!&quot; Sanjuro 
hastily explained.

The woman tilted her head to one side, as if considering Sanjuro&#146;s 
words. She then seemed to notice the camera hanging around his neck. She 
frowned and held out her hand. &quot;Give me your camera,&quot; she ordered 
plainly.

At first Sanjuro thought the woman was mugging him, then realised she 
actually wanted the film inside. She wanted his award-winning pictures! 
&quot;Umm... why? There&#39;s nothing on here except photos of buildings and drug 
dealers, you know, uninteresting things like that,&quot; Sanjuro lied as 
nonchalantly as he could. The woman merely looked at him, her hand still 
extended. &quot;Oh, come on!&quot; whined the spiky-haired man. &quot;Do you know what 
I went through to get these?!&quot; Sanjuro thought about just bolting. But 
then he remembered that she could probably outrun him or simply chuck a 
fireball and barbecue his helpless fleeing butt. He sighed in defeat and 
gave her the camera.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said.

Sanjuro could just imagine the evil and victorious grin behind her red 
scarf. He winced as the woman wrenched the film out of the camera before 
slipping it inside of her coat. She then handed back his camera... for 
which the reporter was somewhat thankful. At least she hadn&#146;t smashed it 
to pieces or anything.

&quot;Don&#39;t follow me again,&quot; the woman commanded coldly.

As she began to walk away and out of the alley, Sanjuro madly wracked 
his brain for a way to save his story. &quot;Wait! Here, take my card!&quot; he 
called desperately after the mysterious woman.

The masked woman stopped in her tracks and turned back to him. &quot;Why 
would I want your card?&quot;

&quot;Well, you know, if you ever wanted to do an exclusive inter--&quot; 
Sanjuro&#146;s words abruptly cut off as she began walking again. &quot;What I 
mean is, I&#39;m one of the top investigative reporters in this city!&quot; the 
man exaggerated. The woman looked back over her shoulder, Sanjuro 
finally believing himself successful in capturing her attention.

&quot;So...?&quot; she questioned.

&quot;So maybe I can investigate stuff for you, dig up intelligence and all 
that...&quot; said Sanjuro, &quot;superheroes always have an intelligence guy.&quot;

She looked at him impassively for a second. &quot;I&#39;m not a superhero,&quot; she 
stated levelly.

&quot;Yeah, maybe... but still, I&#39;m really good at what I do!&quot; boasted 
Sanjuro, hoping the woman would buy into his lies.

She frowned as though deep in thought. After a short time, she seemed to 
come to a decision. &quot;Fine. Give me a card,&quot; she conceded.

Sanjuro grinned broadly and trotted up to her and handed out one of his 
cards. &quot;You want me to put my home number on that?&quot; he asked.

&quot;I think I&#146;ll somehow manage without it,&quot; the masked woman replied 
sarcastically as she pocketed the business card and started to walk away 
once again.

&quot;Hey, wait! What&#39;s your name? What do you call yourself?&quot; Sanjuro 
inquired.

The woman stopped walking and turned her head slightly back in his 
direction, her long raven locks hiding most of her masked features. &quot;I 
don&#39;t have a name,&quot; she said softly, &quot;...not any more.&quot;

As Sanjuro was about to suggest a suitably heroic one, his instincts 
told him to leave it alone. He watched her walk away, a slight wind 
blowing her long hair and coat about. Sanjuro absently wondered how long 
it would take to put more film in his camera and take a shot of her like 
that. While he was thinking, he glanced around the street he stood in. 
Wait a minute... just where the hell was he?

&quot;Hey, wait!&quot; Sanjuro called out once more to the departing woman.

&quot;Geez, what is it now?!&quot; she answered irritably, whirling back around to 
the reporter.

Sanjuro ran up to the mysterious woman and then dropped his gaze to the 
ground, shuffling his feet. &quot;Would you walk me out of this 
neighbourhood?&quot; he asked sheepishly.

She blinked at him, and with a sigh, motioned with her head for him to 
follow her.

******

Sailor Mars internally groaned as she walked with Sanjuro who kept 
shooting her happy looks. Why did she always attract the idiots? But 
with any luck, this guy might come in handy. Having someone who could 
gain access to special information on buildings, people, and 
organizations could be useful in finding out the youma&#39;s headquarters or 
entry point into this world. The sooner Mars destroyed Khairephon, the 
youma&#39;s apparent leader, the better. Hopefully by doing that, it would 
stop the youma influx... or at the very least, disorient them enough so 
she could take care of every single one of them easily.

Sailor Mars flicked her lavender eyes towards Sanjuro. He sort of 
reminded her of Yuuichirou back in Tokyo. The miko wondered if the 
accolade was still at the Hikawa Jinja. She hoped so; her Grandpa would 
need his help maintaining and running the shrine with her gone.

After a half-hour or so of walking, the pair finally reached the end of 
the Hikodo gangland and entered a safer, but still somewhat seedy, 
district.

&quot;Now get lost,&quot; said Sailor Mars, &quot;and if I see anything about what 
happened back there in the Yokohama Daily....&quot; The Senshi of Fire 
trailed off, her threat implied.

Sanjuro opened his mouth to say something, but then clamped it shut. 
Instead, he simply nodded.

&quot;Good. And remember; don&#39;t follow me,&quot; Sailor Mars reminded the reporter 
before she ran off to search for a sufficient place to detransform. 
Sanjuro was left far behind and standing alone in the street.

******

It was nearly three in the morning by the time Rei arrived back at her 
apartment building. She plodded up the stairs to her apartment, and 
after gathering her toiletries, the miko went to the bathroom to take a 
shower and clean and bandage her wounded arm. When Rei was finished in 
the bathroom, an anxious Tsubasa was waiting for her outside in the 
hall.

&quot;Megumi! Where have you been? I thought you got attacked or something!&quot; 
he cried, obviously concerned.

Rei pulled the towel she was wearing a little higher over her chest. 
&quot;You waited up for me?&quot; she questioned curiously.

&quot;Well, I...&quot; Tsubasa blushed and looked away from the raven-haired girl. 
He rubbed the back of his neck nervously. Rei&#146;s neighbour had certainly 
been acting weird lately.

Tsubasa looked back to Rei and his eyes widened as he noticed her 
bandaged arm. &quot;You&#39;re hurt! You weren&#146;t really attacked, were you?!&quot;

Rei looked down at her arm as she frantically searched for an excuse. 
&quot;Uh... no, umm... a dog. A dog bit me.&quot; The Fire Senshi mentally slapped 
her forehead for coming up with such a lame explanation.

&quot;A dog? You should get a rabies shot,&quot; Tsubasa advised.

&quot;Uhh, already got one!&quot; Rei said cheerily. &quot;Look, it&#39;s late, I&#39;ll talk 
to you in the morning... &#39;night!&quot; She then quickly scurried into her 
apartment, then closed and locked the door behind her to prevent any 
further questions from the rather stunned man in the hallway. Tsubasa 
was really beginning to pry into her life more and more these past 
couple of days.

Rei unwrapped the towel from around her body, and then changed into a 
vest and boxers. She tossed Sanjuro&#39;s film and business card onto her 
desk top, switched off the light, then clambered into bed. All the 
while, her mind was thinking about other, more serious, matters. How was 
the Fire Senshi supposed to find out where the youma were truly all 
coming from? She couldn&#39;t really use Sanjuro until she had some lead to 
go on. She needed to get one of the creatures alive and willing to 
talk... which meant going back on yet another hunt through gang 
territory. Rei let out a weary sigh... there had to be another way...

Rei yawned widely. She should get some sleep and let her body rest for 
the upcoming battles ahead... she just knew there would be more. Rei 
reached over and picked up the picture of her and Usagi. She ran her 
fingers gently down the glass in a form of caress. The miko wondered how 
her princess was doing, if she was all right. She wondered if Usagi 
still missed her. Rei believed that her &#145;death&#146; would become a distant 
memory, and in time, her love would forget her. &#145;Time heals all wounds&#146;, 
as was said. Rei placed a light kiss on the image of Usagi, then 
replaced the framed photograph on the bedside table.

&#145;Time heals all wounds&#146;... no, not all wounds... not wounds of... the 
heart. Rei drifted off to sleep, this time dreaming of the girl she 
loved and had left behind.
