----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Did you have a nice day?&quot;
 
Serenity nodded, smiling.  &quot;Yes, Mother, I did.  Haruka-san and 
Michiru-san were very kind to escort me through the city.  The guard 
fell asleep, though.&quot;
 
&quot;I know.  He&#39;s been reprimanded.  I will assign another guard to you.  
Haruka-san, Michiru-san, would you like a room for the night?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, Your Majesty,&quot; Haruka answered for the pair.  &quot;Your offer is very 
kind.  We will retire now.&quot;
 
Later, when the two senshi were in their rooms, Michiru slipped though 
the connecting door and jumped into Haruka&#39;s arms.  The taller woman 
held her wife, knowing that her Michiru was troubled by something.  
&quot;Michiru?&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s right, Haruka.  The world cannot survive the combination of two 
senshi.&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe it can.  Maybe the rule was created because two women cannot have 
children.  That could be the damage to the future Setsuna-san was 
talking about.&quot;
 
&quot;We can&#39;t have a child, Haruka.&quot;
 
&quot;If we need a child, Michiru, we will have a child.  There is nothing 
you and I cannot do, if we want to.&quot;
 
Michiru kissed Haruka and let the taller woman help her out of her 
dress.  There were some parts of marriage she could begin to enjoy.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Unfortunately, we really must return to our own planets.  Perhaps I 
will go home.&quot;
 
Queen Serenity smiled and held out her hand to the pair of Outer Senshi.  
In her palm, she held two necklaces on golden chains; one bore a 
beautiful aquamarine inscribed with the symbol of Kaiousei, and the 
other bore a golden topaz marked with Ten&#39;ousei&#39;s symbol.  &quot;Then please 
accept these gifts.&quot;
 
Haruka stared at the necklaces, reaching out slowly to take hers.  &quot;It&#39;s 
beautiful.&quot;
 
Michiru couldn&#39;t say anything, wiping the tears from her cheek.  Haruka 
fastened the chain around her neck and took Michiru&#39;s, reaching around 
her wife&#39;s neck to fasten the clasp.  &quot;Thank-you,&quot; Michiru managed.  
&quot;They are gorgeous.&quot;
 
Serenity nodded as the pair of senshi stepped back, Haruka wrapping her 
arm around Michiru and pulling out her henshin stick.  Closing her eyes, 
she concentrated her power and teleported herself and her wife to Phobos 
Deimos Castle, where the four Inner Senshi and a priest Serenity had 
never met were waiting for them.
 
As the pair vanished in a swirl of wind, Serenity wondered what was 
going on between them.  They were certainly more than friends.
 
Just like Kazeko and Shousha.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;You have to go home?  What about Rei-chan?&quot;
 
Minako hung her head, glancing at the pile of her belongings that Rei&#39;s 
servants were creating.  &quot;I love her, Haruka-kun, but I don&#39;t have your 
courage or your power.  I have to go home.&quot;
 
&quot;Then take her with you.&quot;
 
Minako looked up, eyes wide, and Rei stopped at the scene when she 
entered the room.  Ami and Makoto were just behind her.  Kiyoshi was 
busy conversing with the priests of Kasei who were visiting the palace, 
wise enough to stay out of the affairs of the Senshi until it was time 
to leave.  &quot;What?  Haruka-kun, Father is calling me home to marry me 
off.  He doesn&#39;t want me to see Rei anymore.&quot;
 
&quot;There is not enough time in one short life to live as you would wish 
and as your father would wish.  Embrace the truth you know in your heart 
and take hold of those you love for they will not always be around,&quot; Ami 
whispered, echoing Haruka&#39;s advice to her.  &quot;You can obey your father 
without obeying everything he wants.  Take Rei-chan with you.&quot;
 
Minako looked at Ami, eyes wide.  &quot;Where did you learn that?&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka-kun told me a while ago.  She was right back then and she&#39;s 
right now.  Mako-chan is going back to Suisei with me, no matter what my 
father says.  Don&#39;t be afraid of anyone.&quot;
 
Rei looked at Minako, grayish purple eyes full of tears.  &quot;Don&#39;t leave 
me behind,&quot; the princess whispered.  &quot;My parents aren&#39;t home right now 
and they won&#39;t know I&#39;m leaving until we get to your palace.&quot;  The other 
Senshi pulled away, leaving the pair alone in the room.
 
Minako touched Rei&#39;s cheek, brushing the tears away.  &quot;I don&#39;t want my 
parents to hate you, my love.  That&#39;s all that will happen if you go 
home with me.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t care, Mina.  I don&#39;t care.&quot;  Rei kissed Minako&#39;s palm, watching 
her partner for a reaction.  &quot;I know you&#39;re scared of your father, but 
you&#39;re forgetting one thing&#151;that I&#39;m in love with you.  I don&#39;t want to 
lose you.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Makoto held Ami, watching the closed door, wondering what was going on 
between the other two princesses.  &quot;Do you think Rei-chan will go to 
Kinsei?&quot;
 
&quot;I hope so, Mako-chan.  If I can defy my father, anyone can.&quot;
 
Haruka watched Ami and Makoto from her chair on the other side of the 
room, Michiru seated securely in her lap.  Idly, she ran her finger up 
and down Michiru&#39;s arm, watching the light play across the other woman&#39;s 
soft skin.  What would happen to them when Shousha found out that she 
was a woman?
 
&quot;She can&#39;t do anything to us.&quot;
 
It took a moment for Haruka to register that Michiru had even spoken, 
and a moment longer to process her words.  &quot;What?&quot;
 
Michiru laughed, catching Haruka&#39;s hand.  &quot;I know what you were thinking 
about.  My mother can&#39;t undo what we&#39;ve done and no one can keep us 
apart.&quot;
 
Haruka twisted her hand around and wrapped her fingers around Michiru&#39;s 
wrist.  &quot;I guess you&#39;re right; no matter how much your mother hates me, 
she doesn&#39;t have the power to keep us apart.  Besides, I love you, and I 
can always find you.&quot;
 
The door suddenly opened, and Rei emerged, wiping tears off her cheeks.  
She looked around before heading to her room, gesturing for three 
servants to follow her.  Minako exited right behind her, grabbing her 
hand as the two met.  Rei smiled, and the other Senshi sighed in relief.  
They knew what had happened.
 
Haruka helped Rei&#39;s servants gather the belongings she would need for 
the trip to Kinsei, not actually sure why she was helping.  But then she 
looked at Michiru and knew that love was worth a little hard work, 
especially for the more timid Inner Senshi.
 
Rei and Minako were examining the pile of belongings to make sure they 
hadn&#39;t forgotten anything when Michiru fell to the floor, hands holding 
her head.  &quot;Michiru!&quot;  Haruka pulled the aqua-haired girl into her arms, 
watching as Neptune&#39;s henshin stick rolled onto the floor, glowing 
fiercely in agitation.  Beside the stick, the Aqua Mirror, talisman of 
Sailor Neptune, appeared, its surface black and dull.  Kaiou Michiru 
collapsed, her hand falling on the dim surface as she lost 
consciousness.</pre>
