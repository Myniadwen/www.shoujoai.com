<p>Ami, Makoto and Rei were seated in their chairs. Makoto sighed while  Rei repeatedly tapped her foot. Ami looked nervously between the two  girls and the door. “Maybe something came up?” said Ami who was  beginning to look even more nervous.</p>
<p>“Baka Usagi. Always late as usual,” said Makoto.</p>
<p>Rei just stayed silent. She was not tapping her foot because of impatience. <em>If something came up with Usagi, then I hope it is nothing bad.</em></p>
<p>Rei closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Flashback:</p>
<p><em>Minako  and Rei were walking nearby the temple discussing how they were going  to approach Usagi about what they know about her. As they both sat at a  nearby bench, Minako’s phone suddenly rang. Rei looked at her and  Minako showed that it was Usagi. </em></p>
<p>“<em>Oh. Hi Usagi. I was about to call you.” </em></p>
<p><em>Rei looked worriedly at Minako and whispered, “Did something happen?” Minako shook her head.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Hang on a minute,” She covered her phone so that Usagi could not hear. “She’s just bored.” Rei sighed with relief.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Okay I’m back. Get ready and I’ll pick you up in a few minutes. See you.” She closed her phone and looked at Rei.</em></p>
<p>“<em>You  go on. I still have my temple chores to finish. I’ll just see the both  of you tonight.” With that, both girls embraced and Minako began to  walk towards her car.</em></p>
<p>End of Flashback.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the  door quickly opened and Usagi and Minako rushed inside. Rei opened her  eyes at the sound of the door slamming closed and footsteps running  down the stairs towards them.</p>
<p>“Gomen!” exclaimed Usagi.</p>
<p>“Usagi! Do you know what time it is? You’re late. Again,” said Makoto.</p>
<p>Usagi looked up at her nervously and Minako intervened.</p>
<p>“It was my fault. I decided to pick up Usagi, but my car endured a flat tire on the way.”</p>
<p>Usagi looked at Minako confused. Makoto sighed, she could never stay angry with Usagi.</p>
<p>“You should have at least called. We got worried,” said Ami.</p>
<p>Rei simply looked up at Minako as she mouthed, <em>meet me after this.</em> Minako nodded.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s just get started shall we?” Rei addressed everyone.</p>
<p>Luna  and Artemis joined the girls in the table and they were discussing  tactics and the importance of remembering past memories in order to  keep from making the same mistakes in the past life. Although they have  been given a second chance, there is still a possibility of something  recurring.</p>
<p><em>Like losing a friend, </em>thought Rei. Her heart felt heavy whenever she thought about that possibility and eyed Usagi. <em>Why do the people I care about so much have to suffer? First it was mama, then Minako, and now Usagi?</em></p>
<p>After  the meeting, all five girls began to leave the room. Minako offered to  drop everyone home, in which they all agreed due to exhaustion. After  dropping Ami and Makoto home, Rei and Usagi were the only ones left.  Usagi had fallen asleep during the ride and instead of heading towards  her house or the Hikawa temple, the car pulled over at Minako’s  penthouse.</p>
<p>She opened the door while one of her bodyguards  carried Usagi inside. Rei trailed behind and followed them inside.  Minako had Usagi placed on her bed and dismissed the bodyguard. She  stirred a bit, but fell silent once again. When she knew that Usagi  would be all right Minako kept one dim light on and shut the door as  quietly as she could. Minako picked up her cell phone and started to  dial numbers.</p>
<p>“Moshi moshi!”</p>
<p>“Oh good evening Mrs. Tsukino,  it’s Minako. Is it okay if Usagi spent the night here? She fell asleep  and I didn’t want to wake her.”</p>
<p>“Is she okay? I hope you girls didn't tire her out too much.”</p>
<p>&quot;She's fine. Nothing we can't handle. We'll call you if anything. I promise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, please take care of her then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai.&quot;</p>
<p>The idol closed her phone, then walked towards the living room and settled next to Rei.</p>
<p>“She didn’t show it much, but she was really exhausted today,” stated Rei with anxiety.</p>
<p>Minako nodded, “Rei, she opened up.”</p>
<p>The miko was now intently listening, “And?”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t want to tell anyone. At least not yet.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not fair! Their friend…<em>our</em> friend is dying and they have no clue about it!”</p>
<p>“Give her time and she’ll come around.”</p>
<p>Rei sighed. “ Does she even have time?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And she has us”</p>
<p>Rei  was silent, and tears began to form. “Minako. I’m scared. I’m scared of  losing Usagi like how I lost you once. That was already too much for me  to see you die before my eyes, and now Usagi?! She was the one who even  became my friend when nobody else was there. She was the reason I was  even able to meet you.”</p>
<p>Minako embraced Rei in her arms. “We just need to be there for her. Right now she needs us.”</p>
<p>Rei  sobbed as she stayed in the idols arms. She agreed to spend the night  in order to keep a close watch on Usagi. Inside Minako’s room there was  a small couch that could be unfolded into a bed. Rei lay down and  stared at the ceiling. She sighed, then turned around and found that  Minako was already sound asleep. She looked over towards the bed Usagi  slept in. <em>It’s hard to believe that she’s going though all of this,  and still be able to muster up some energy and devote it to her friends  and family. </em></p>
<p>The miko tossed and turned in bed, she must  have stirred Minako because the idol mumbled a few words and went  silent once again. It was always hard to Rei to find sleep anywhere  other than her own room. Finally, after giving up with trying to fall  asleep, she stepped outside to the balcony. It was a cold and Rei  hugged her arms for warmth. She settled on one of the chairs outside  and looked up towards the night sky. She could spot the planets Venus  and Mars shining brightly against the dark sky, and of course, she  spotted the moon. Funny how, they once used to live there, happy and  protecting their princess. A few of her past memories flooded her mind,  one of which stayed in her mind. A memory of all five girls together,  laughing as if nothing were to happen to them at all. Back when nothing  mattered to them except trying to pull pranks on Luna and Artemis.  Within a few minutes, Rei closed her eyes and finally drifted into  sleep.</p>
