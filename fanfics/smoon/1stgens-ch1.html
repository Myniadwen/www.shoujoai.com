<pre>Author&#39;s Notes

Ok, this is my first actual attempt at a lemon (breaking yet another 
unspoken law of things I thought to never write). So be gentle with 
me. I usually don&#39;t do this.
I posted this as a single story and not an added chapter because of 
the rating.

Hi!

I think you can guess what this is, right? Honestly, you don&#39;t have 
to read this if you are in any way disgusted by such a thing. I&#39;m not 
even sure, if I... err, we... are actually in the best way 
descriptive of That Night&#39;s events but we&#39;ll try. Since I don&#39;t feel 
like adding much more to this, read or not read on, it&#39;s your choice.

Your for once extremely embarrassed and blushing

Minako

(Minako)
I sat there stock-still for a moment, fully aware of how close I was 
to the other girl, VERY aware of the cool hands on my back, stroking 
softly up and down without doing much more. Until now, the initial 
pain of the dream-memory had overshadowed every other conscious 
thought. The only thing I had felt was pain. Hebe&#39;s pain mostly, but 
a lot of it my own because it reminded me of what could have been, 
what might had been, if I just remembered when we were reawakened. I 
could have rescued Kunzite... maybe. At least I could have tried, 
couldn&#39;t I? Again, a lot of this was Hebe&#39;s wishful thinking mixing 
with my own guilt. I was barely aware of Hotaru&#39;s soothing words and 
even the realization that my Firefly had actually experienced this 
second last, dreadful nemesis - seeing the Princess and Prince die 
was the last - just nagged on my mind, if anything, just increasing 
my pain and guilt. Adonis had been right after all. There would never 
be true love for me, I was only devoted to my mission, to protect the 
Princess. I was... kissing Hotaru?
	Even though I had previously been in a pain-filled trance, it 
was hard to ignore the powerful swirling of energy and the demanding, 
primal need slowly forcing its way out from whatever hole it had 
crawled into after the shower. My highly attuned senses became 
strikingly more and more aware of the other girl&#39;s movements of her 
hands on my bare skin. I couldn&#39;t suppress the low growl coming from 
deep inside my throat.
	&quot;Raven, if you don&#39;t stop now...&quot; I started, knowing how 
useless it was. Hotaru wouldn&#39;t stop, somehow I knew she wouldn&#39;t. 
And I knew with a frightening clarity that I didn&#39;t want her too. 
However, I was scared, scared of what could happen because although I 
had never done it before, I had a distinct idea of what would happen, 
if I submitted to my primal needs - and it didn&#39;t help that some of 
Hebe&#39;s memories confirmed that. I was strong, even in this form, and 
my body reacted to it in a natural way that often frightened me to an 
extent. I felt the need to dominate, to posses, to... take. For a 
Senshi, and one who represented the planet of love, that should be 
something deeply repulsing but strangely it wasn&#39;t. I knew it was 
part of me, part of what I was and what the Senshi of Love ultimately 
craved for. The urge to mate... And that frightened me even more, 
because I could not be really certain of what I would do to this mate.
	&quot;Hush, Hebe. Let me make it go away.&quot; That was the final 
straw, I think. Even Hebe who was demanding inside of me to stop, 
screaming betrayal, betrayal for the love of Kunzite who I had just 
dreamt of and grieved for. I should not do this now, I should not 
give in, at a situation like this. It wasn&#39;t healthy. Not for me and 
not for a relationship. But, hearing Hotaru&#39;s gentle words, promising 
relief, promising a place better than the constant pain, I truly 
didn&#39;t care anymore. I was tired of waiting, I was tired of the pain, 
the grieving, the tears and the endless self-misery. I was tired of 
letting every relationship slip through my fingers because I was too 
damn shy to take action when necessary, to fight for love. I always 
tried and tried, but I was never able to hold onto it when it was 
really important. Not this time, I stated firmly and didn&#39;t know what 
emotions actually went with that silent statement. Love, need, lust, 
desperation...  I could not differ anymore and I was tired to do so.
	My head snapped up as I felt Hotaru&#39;s lips suddenly on my 
neck, nibbling softly on the flesh and her hand brushing ever so 
slightly under the waistline, igniting the already fueled fire within 
me even further. Energy danced around us and I think I never felt so 
aware of every square inch of my body before. Never, not even the 
time we fought the DD Girls. The strange, radiant power that so 
mystically formed between us was stronger than ever, enveloping us as 
much as it filled us from the inside - filled us with power, peace 
and newly-built arousal. It caressed my skin beneath and sent me 
already almost over the edge before we even began.
	I growled again and then cried out as Hotaru actually bit 
down a bit on the sensitive flesh, sending waves - and this was 
probably more true than descriptive - of pleasure and energy down my 
body, washing over me and pushing the primal force lingering right 
under the surface sky-high...
	With one quick movement, that I was sure she was barely able 
to register, I had her pinned down below me, my hands pushing hers 
down at the raven-haired girl sides. I knew I was seconds away of 
losing full control and took the short moment to look down into her 
face and beautiful violet eyes, searching for one last trace of 
resentment that would convince me to clamp down on the primal need 
beginning to drive my body, as hard as it might be. There was only 
deep, open love and an unspoken invitation with which she told me 
that whatever would happen, would be all right.
	&quot;You wanted it that way...&quot; I growled and dove down with my 
face to capture her lips with mine in a raw display of passion that 
no one of this world had ever know until now. The passion of a 
Sailorsenshi mating.

(Hotaru)
I think I blindly overestimated myself and my actions. A surprised 
gasp - or was it a moan? - escaped my lips as Minako pushed me down 
on the bed, roughly pressing me hard into the mattress. I should have 
known better actually. She was a Senshi and even in this form she was 
probably a tenfold stronger than me. If she wanted to, she could 
probably hold me up with one hand. That alone should have scared me 
but the fact that she was looming over me, silently searching for an 
answer that I knew I had already provided, that way, the posture, the 
eyes... All of it held something animalistic and over all dominating. 
As a male animal making clear to his mate who is the stronger one. 
That should really have scared me. Strangely, it didn&#39;t. Truth be 
told, as much as I hated to be dominated by others, this was 
different. This wasn&#39;t classmates testing their influence on me 
because it gave them some sort of sadistic satisfaction. No, this was 
a beautiful blonde, senshi and all-powerful human - hell, other-
worldly being - dominating because she wanted ME! Me, of all people, 
this tiny unworthy, mere Earth girl with a dark past and possibly 
horrible secrets, this...
	Oh Kami-sama! Any coherent thought fled from my mind as I 
felt her lips pressed to mine, our bodies touching roughly, her 
breasts pressing against mine with only the thin nightgowns between 
them. Minako was nipping at my lower lip, her tongue furiously 
demanding entrance in a way that left only compliance as the sole 
healthy reply. I tried to tangle my own tongue with hers but she 
didn&#39;t let me, diving deep into my mouth with hers and sending energy 
reactions full-force into my chest, fueling a need in me that I never 
had known before.
	As she finally let me kiss back properly it was like an 
explosion of fireworks and I had actually shut my eyes to not go 
blind from the sudden tsunami-like energy shooting skywards in 
response to the sensations. Minako tasted sweet, a bit like cherries, 
but it reminded me more of flowers, lilies maybe, but I could be 
wrong. All too quickly she pulled away and I looked confused and a 
bit disappointed just to roll back my eyes again, as she continued 
her tongue-exploring first nibbling on my earlobe, then descending 
down to shortly suck on my neck before she did the same to my throat. 
All the while, the blonde goddess had me pinned down with raw force 
that hurt, but at the same time strangely aroused me even more.
	I was in a world of bliss as Minako stopped and looked down 
at my chest for a moment. Sensing her intention and driven by my own 
need for closer contact, I tried to help matters by slowly lifting up 
and allowing her to take off my nightgown. My lover, however, had 
different ideas about it as she pushed me back onto the mattress and 
studied me for a moment more. I sought out her eyes and saw almost 
frightening amounts of lust mixing with passion and love.
	I suppressed a scream that could have been surprise as well 
as shock and dimmed it down to a mere squeak as with one quick motion 
Minako had torn open the gown, the front of the material falling to 
either sides of me. Her blue eyes flashed once and before I knew it, 
she had her mouth closed over one already erect nipple, biting down 
with painfully-pleasing force. The intensity made me scream so loud, 
I was sure the whole town heard, but I didn&#39;t really care about it at 
the moment.
	The energy-aura probably had the appearance of being on fire 
now and reacted to any oh-so-little touch tenfold. I had my eyes 
pressed shut and my head buried back into the pillow as my breathing 
came in short, labored gasps. This only was intensified as Minako, 
while still sucking madly on my left breast, brought up one hand to 
grip the other in a painful way, squeezing it and rubbing the nipple 
with mind-blowing accuracy and force.	
	Again she tore away to lick her way upwards while her hands 
were still paying my breast furthermost attention. We met back in a 
passionate kiss, which left my head swimming and my blood pumping in 
my ears. &quot;Minako...&quot; I managed to croak out between cries of pleasure 
and pain. Both had already mixed together and were part of the same 
play of passion. But I needed contact, more contact, full contact. 
But once again she didn&#39;t give it as she drank my mouth deeply as I 
felt one of her hands traveling downwards, brushing over my navel, 
while the other one was still inflicting torture-like pleasure to one 
of my breasts. I called out her name once again in desperation as her 
other hand had reached my inner thighs and was surprisingly softly 
brushing against the curls of my center, testing my reaction 
thoroughly.
	The blonde looked down at me for a moment as if she had just 
registered my plea and the more than telltale signs I was giving off. 
For a moment, I thought she would be taking me right there on the 
spot, without giving me even time to do something myself. Again, I 
didn&#39;t even have time to blink as she pulled her own nightgown open, 
actually taking her time to slide it off her body and then throwing 
it aside. I could only stare up at the perfection of female beauty, a 
Goddess among Goddesses that no one could even dream to walk Earth in 
an eternity. And she was mine or I was hers, that didn&#39;t matter. She 
was here only for me. The not oversized but neither skinny breast, 
perfectly round with lovely pink nipples, the perfect curves, the 
long slender legs with the already wet center covered by beautiful, 
golden public-hair. And even more magnificent was the raw play of 
muscles containing superhuman-strength. They could crush a mere 
mortal beneath them, but also be so gentle and passionate as 
necessary. The Goddess of Love, Venus, was all mine...

(Minako)
That&#39;s exactly what I was afraid of. This was not at all how I 
picture my first time. In my dreams, it was all sweet and soft, not 
this rough mating swinging between painful torture and agonizing 
pleasure that I was giving to Hotaru. But strangely, it felt just 
right. I expected it to please the Senshi in me, maybe even Hebe 
since she was already used to it. But me? No, I clearly didn&#39;t expect 
me to be so totally content with the act. It just felt so right, I 
couldn&#39;t help it.
	I also couldn&#39;t help to wet my lips in anticipation as I 
noticed Hotaru&#39;s eyes mesmerized by my now naked body. Thereby Raven 
didn&#39;t have to hide anything herself. Her body was well-developed for 
a fourteen-year old, her breasts a little small but lovely - and 
quite frankly tasty - nonetheless. Her body was like a picture drawn 
by a great artist with powerful compassion. And the feel of the cool 
skin was intoxicating to my Senshi senses.
	Allowing the other girl for once to free her hands from the 
mattress which I had held down with my elbows alone while using my 
hands, I let loose with a gasp and an intake of breath of my own as 
Hotaru eagerly reached up to touch my breasts, first feather-light 
than more passionate and actually hungry. Her fingers pressed into my 
skin and she dug a fingernail into my left nipple, which surprised 
and let me throw my head back with a cry.
	Something told me it wasn&#39;t time for that already so I firmly 
gripped her hands and pressed them back down on the bed and her own 
nightgown still lying under the helpless girl. Hotaru groaned 
frustrated, trying to break my hold but quickly relenting as I 
descended down on her, pressing skin to skin, capturing her lips once 
more and darting forward with my tongue, tasting the sweet scent of 
Hotaru&#39;s mouth, leaving her occupied for a moment while one hand 
slowly left her place on the girl&#39;s wrist once again on a direct path 
to its earlier origin.
	Hotaru&#39;s eyes fluttered open as my fingers brushed over raven-
hair below and pushed her legs apart with ease. I felt her moaning 
into my mouth as I pushed deeper, slowly but roughly stroking the 
inner regions of her most private area, thrusting in and out, adding 
another finger to the first two, as I pressed down at the center of 
her womanhood, causing a muffled scream to filter through our still 
locked lips. Any thoughts about waiting left me, when I increased my 
rhythm. In and out, two fingers, then a third one, slowly driving her 
over the edge, the now supernova-like energy filling and pushing her 
need again and again.
	I sought out her eyes now, dreading a confirmation that I 
wasn&#39;t destroying anything if I continued now. I needed to know, if 
she wanted me take her. &quot;Onegai, Minako, onegai... It&#39;s too much! 
Take me! ONEGAI!&quot; And I did. Closing my hand into a fist I thrust 
hard once against the barrier of her virginity and broke through, my 
head snapping up from the backlash of the energy and the howl of pain 
and passion from Hotaru&#39;s release at its intense 
peak. &quot;MMMMINAKOOOOO!&quot;
	As her orgasm crashed over us, I held onto her tightly, 
steadying her body with the other hand. Quite frankly you would think 
a release like this would be enough for normal people, right? Well, 
we weren&#39;t normal people. The energy catapulting to new heights 
almost send me over the edge behind my lover. But with an audible 
growl, I declined myself the pleasure. Instead I dug down between 
Hotaru&#39;s legs before she could even protest - I guess both of us 
weren&#39;t even able to think one percent clearly at the moment -, 
driven by an undeniable frightening and exciting hunger altogether, I 
took my hand away and replaced it with my lips, closing quickly 
around the sensitive flesh that practically burned by now. I tasted 
blood mixed together with the sweet musky scent that was Hotaru&#39;s 
center. The smell alone made me bite down in ecstasy, another cry of 
pain from Hotaru reaching my ears, her hands by now gripping my head 
through the blonde mess of hair and pushing me further inside of her.
	I sucked, first gently than rougher at her clit, drawing 
juice as much as the remains of her taken virginity. Sending out my 
tongue, I made wide circles around her pleasure spot, making them 
thinner with every stroke. Finally reaching my destination, I pushed 
my tongue as far as I could inside of her, pushing her over the edge 
once again with one long stroke from one side to the other. Hotaru 
quivered and shuddered as she came a second time in seconds and her 
salvia splashed into my waiting, hungry mouth.
	Slowly I lifted my face after drinking every last drop of her 
intoxicating fluids, meeting her passion-filled gaze with one of my 
own. We were both panting hard - even though I didn&#39;t have my own 
release yet and there was a wild lust in both of our eyes now. It 
wasn&#39;t enough. It was far from enough. The energy bond already began 
to fill Hotaru with more need and necessary stamina. There was no 
immediate escape from this cycle other than one possible option.
	Sliding up Hotaru&#39;s body once again, I pushed one of my legs 
over hers, placing my own wet clit over hers, rubbing the centers of 
our sexual pleasure together while I once again took her breast in my 
hands, giving them the same ministrations of pleasure and pain as 
before, my fingernails boring into her flesh. Hotaru responded in 
kind, her hands free from restriction now penetrating my own flesh 
and sending me higher and higher with every squeeze, every cut, every 
stroke...
	Our lips met fiercely once again, our tongues now dancing in 
perfect rhythm, our breathing labored and matching a steaming train 
on full fuel. Our bodies came together as I nearly crushed the 
fragile girl beneath me, breast pressing into breast, skin into skin, 
center against center. My nails dug into her flesh as I held her hips 
steady while riding waves of otherworldly-intense pleasure and I let 
loose with another cry as I felt her hands on my back, her own nails 
surely leaving red marks there.
	I could feel my own climax approaching as I abandoned 
Hotaru&#39;s mouth for her neck, sensing that she needed a little more 
help in order for us to come together.
	&quot;Megami-sama, Minako... yess...&quot; she hissed as I sucked hard 
on her white skin, pushing her hips up further against mine, 
increasing the tempo of our bodies. &quot;I... I&#39;m going to come now,&quot; I 
rasped feeling the inevitable approach of my release. &quot;I&#39;m... going 
to come tooooo..aahhh!&quot;
	As the wave of my first lover-initiated, ultimately 
fascinating-beyond-belief orgasm shook me to the core, taking Hotaru 
over the edge at the very same moment, the energy settling completely 
into our touching centers became unbearable and I clamped down 
ecstatic on Hotaru&#39;s neck. Blood was drawn almost immediately but not 
really much. I held onto her, sucking lust-driven at the mark I had 
made while the outbreak of our combined release slowly, ever-so-
slowly subsided, leaving me drained and near exhaustion to which the 
battle fatigue from the evening was nothing.
	With the last bit of strength, I rolled of my lover and 
pulled her into a tight embrace while her shuddering body still dealt 
with the ride I just put her through. Whispering words of love over 
again, I finally rested my head on the pillow and heaved a truly 
blissful sigh which was answered by one of Hotaru&#39;s own as her body 
relaxed against mine.

(Hotaru)
Giddy, peace, comfort, love, pain, passion, lust... If you&#39;d ask me 
to put out any of these emotions I would bluntly tell you that this 
was as impossible as walking right through the sun - with the latter 
even closer to possibility. My breath slowly returned to normal while 
I lay there, cuddled closely in Minako&#39;s arms. Kami-sama, what had I 
done? What had driven me to this reckless action? No, no, I didn&#39;t 
regret anything and as my conscious mind slowly returned to me, I 
still believed that it had been the best solution for both us. But... 
that. I shuddered a little from the aftereffects of the experience - 
or better the lack of remarkable outstanding ones. I should ache, I 
should hurt from the partly painful lovemaking, by all means, I 
should already be deep asleep from the wild ride. Now, however, I 
just felt content and right where I belonged. In the arms of my... 
mate? I guess you could count that as mating. Mating with the Goddess 
of Love... I think they&#39;d put me into a clinic, lock me up and throw 
the key away, if I told any of this to my classmates back home.
	&quot;Raven? You alright...?&quot; Minako&#39;s quiet voice came from 
behind me and I noticed that it was laced with distinct worry. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t mean to hurt you, I just... well, I warned you that I wouldn&#39;t 
be able to stay in control and uh... You see, err... know now that 
there are certain aspects to sex with a Senshi that are...&quot; Her voice 
was frantic now, trembling more and more with every word. I turned 
around in her arms slightly and hushed her with a short but sweet 
kiss to her lips. &quot;Aishiteru.&quot; Minako looked at me uncertain but was 
met with total reassurance in my eyes. Though the act was painful to 
some point, it was incredible beyond belief and I was sure that at 
the moment I was the only being on the planet who could claim such an 
experience her own. That, I was quite proud of. &quot;Just thinking about 
the definite creepiness of the bond. I mean we are still awake and 
just a little... uh, resting?&quot;
	Minako laughed lightly at that and tightened her grip around 
me. &quot;So,&quot; she asked mischievously, &quot;you haven&#39;t had enough already?&quot; 
I thought about the question for the exact time of two seconds before 
responding in my own way that spoke volumes. Either I surprised 
Minako or she let me do it - I would probably opt for the latter - as 
I managed to roll us around and land on top of her. My blonde lover 
smiled up at me. &quot;Thought so.&quot; I answered her smile with a 
calculating and far from coy and innocent one. &quot;It&#39;s payback now for 
leaving me hanging so long,&quot; I finally said seductively. Minako 
shivered a bit under my gaze but I could not quite determine if it 
was from excitement or fear. Good.
	She let out a startled squeak however as I dived directly to 
the source, sending my tongue out to give one long stroke over her 
nether lips, then pulling back and settling myself firmly on her 
chest, purposely ignoring her lower region. Minako growled in 
frustration as I bent down to kiss her softly and pull back nearly as 
quickly as before. My hands were working her swollen breasts with 
soft, methodic accuracy. Not pinching or anything of that matter, 
just soft, barely touching strokes. I think my lover actually 
purred... Though her eyes betrayed her content, she wanted more 
contact, but I just waved a finger in front of her face. &quot;No, no, you 
wait.&quot; I knew she could have easily flipped us over or disobeyed my 
silent plea for not taking any actions, but she just rolled her eyes 
with an audible moan.
	I worked my way to her neck, abandoning her breast to slide 
my hand down behind me, over her lips and further downward before 
they found the smooth curves of Minako&#39;s butt, lingering there for a 
few moments on the smooth flesh while I gave a few gentle kisses over 
my lovers exposed neck and throat.
	&quot;Get up a bit and turn around,&quot; I instructed and lifted a bit 
of her. Minako complied eagerly and I used the moment to finally tug 
my own, probably now unusable nightgown from the covers and toss it 
on the ground in the general direction of Minako&#39;s own. I sat back to 
admire my lovers backside for a moment and Minako helped matters 
wonderfully by giving the expression of lolling like a feline. When I 
covered her body with mine, she let out another content purr. My 
breasts were pressing into her flesh, while I pushed some golden hair 
away to nibble on her neck again.
	A few seconds later I slowly descended, sliding my body down 
her back, my breasts clearly enjoying the sensation and if the play 
of muscles was any indication, Minako did to. I reached deep into 
myself drawing onto the energy that had been a bit less outward after 
our first combined release; I began testing a theory. I had noticed 
while I lay helplessly under Minako&#39;s ministrations earlier that the 
power could be manipulated to a certain degree of what exactly it 
should to. So it came that while I kissed my way downwards, I sent 
the energy under Minako, extending soft, not solid fingers to caress 
her breasts softly - to a point where it became torturous which was 
only fair after what Minako did to me. The person in question gave a 
startled yelp as an indication of my success, followed by a growl-
like moan. I pinched down a bit harder with my invisible fingers and 
drew a second, this time really more growl than moan. Switching from 
gentle torture to a bit more rougher method that my lover seemed to 
actually crave, I gathered a bit more energy and squeezed both of her 
nipples hard, while pressing down merciless on the breasts 
themselves. The result was a sharp screech. &quot;Hotaruuuhh... Oh, my...!&quot;
	Excellent, just the distraction I needed, she wasn&#39;t prepared 
as I reached my actual destination. My lover was so surprised her 
head shot up from the pillow as she let out a gasp, then fell down 
again taking in a sharp breath. I was mildly surprised at myself for 
kissing her quite perfect butt cheeks and then flicking my tongue 
around her rear end. Some people might find it offending or even 
disgusting, but there was nothing of this sort considering Minako&#39;s 
firm butt cheeks. Her whole body, including this particular area, was 
a work of art, perfect like a statue. The true Goddess of Love. What 
should there be to be offended at? If I looked at this most perfect 
creature of nature, I could only wonder again, with what exactly I 
deserved someone like that. How had I earned the divine blessing in 
my miserable existence so far that I could interact with someone like 
her on that level? I truly didn&#39;t know, but without doubt I know it 
was happening just now and I had to do my utmost best to please the 
Goddess below me. And I would do so.

(Minako)
Megami-sama, Aphrodite, Serenity... What was she doing to me? I 
shuddered in pleasure and delight as I felt Hotaru&#39;s lips and tongue 
on the smooth flesh of my butt and hundreds of volts just coursed 
through my system that did not even had anything to do with the 
energy. My head plumped down on the pillow again as the energy wave 
hit me and that was only the foreplay! When Hotaru suddenly pressed 
forward with two fingers at once into my anus, I was on the verge of 
exploding already. &quot;Oh... Hotaru,&quot; I moaned, which turned into a hiss 
as she paid me back for my own harsh methods with equal 
mercilessness, adding a third finger and ramming all three of them 
right into my hole, inflicting an orgasm within moments.
	The raven-haired goddess didn&#39;t let up though. Even before my 
release fully subsided, she began plunging in and out on a steady 
rhythm. I let out a startled gasp as Hotaru pulled me up against her, 
her fingers never leaving her work below. Her other hand found my 
left breast again and scraped hard over erect nipple. I turned my 
head slightly and was met by Hotaru&#39;s lips on mine, her tongue diving 
in without hesitation.
	At the moment, I already thought I was in heaven. It couldn&#39;t 
possibly get any better than this right? Kami, was I wrong. Hotaru 
proved to be a surprising, a little genius in mastering the strange 
energy between us. As the pressure of the invisible fingers on my 
breast lowered noticeably, I let out a groan of disapproval but that 
quickly turned into an audible shriek as my head shot up from the 
sensation of gentle but probing energy over my aching clit. The 
unnatural tendrils picked up their pace quickly and I think I was 
torn apart from the sheer ecstasy of it all.
	Hotaru brought her lips back to mine, her left hand still 
pleasuring the respective breast. In between the glorious bliss of 
being probed on both of my sex centers at once, I became restless and 
strongly craved to return the sensation to my mate. Getting a hold of 
some of the now literally blazing energy and directed it into 
Hotaru&#39;s own center below, feeling the moan drawn out of her throat 
in my own mouth. It didn&#39;t take both of us very long to reach a 
blinding peak of pleasure. I had grabbed Hotaru&#39;s head with one hand, 
while I had dug the fingernails of the other in my own breast in 
order to intensify the pleasure even more.
	As Hotaru&#39;s fingers shot forward simultaneously with her 
energy ministration of my clit the world around me went white and the 
last I heard was Hotaru&#39;s own crescending screech as I instinctively 
brought her over the edge as well. My body went totally stiff and I 
felt waves of pleasure hit me again as well as another awareness 
right beside me. It was a soft, soothing touch and one that felt 
completely safe. Two souls brushing up against each other. But there 
still was a tiny barrier for us to become totally whole, something 
that didn&#39;t feel alike as it should.
	I blinked my eyes at the sensation and noticed that I was 
lying back on my chest, breathing hard next to an equally shaken 
Hotaru, our faces turned towards each other. &quot;That was...&quot; she began 
but trailed off, either still too breathless or just at a loss for 
words. &quot;Indescribable?&quot; I offered weakly but feeling the energy 
return already. It was, as if it was telling us that there was still 
something to do, still something to accomplish that would ensure the 
joining... the mating. I smiled wickedly as I noticed what exactly it 
was. Let&#39;s see, if she found out herself. An idea formed in my mind 
and my grin only spread wider. Hotaru gulped. &quot;Nan...&quot;
	In a flash I was on top of her, kissing and licking my way 
downward. Stopping shortly to give her swollen and already clearly 
marked breasts another thorough exploration with tongue, teeth and 
fingernails, a bit softer this time and more controlled, maybe even a 
bit playful. Hotaru at least couldn&#39;t describe if she wanted to 
groan, moan, cry out or even giggle... She did giggle when I flicked 
my tongue playfully and testing over her bellybutton.
	Parting her legs wide, I gently stroked along her inner 
thighs first with my hands when with my tongue, while grabbing her 
around her hips lifting her up to stroke her firm cheeks as she did 
before. I continued my actions, occasionally extending my tongue to 
not do so more than tickle her already moist clit or scratching along 
her anus with painfully slow torture. Needless to say, I had Hotaru 
squirming and writhing under my payback of her earlier ministrations.
	&quot;Onegai, Minako... I need.,..&quot; She was panting already and 
groaned helplessly as I lifted my head to look at her in a curious 
playful way. &quot;What do you need, Hotaru?&quot; I asked innocently. She 
thrust her head to one side as I plunged a finger in her rear end and 
withdrew immediately. &quot;This?&quot; I asked, then bent down to place my 
teeth around her aching clit, sucking hard a few times before looking 
up again. &quot;Or this?&quot; My mate looked even more vulnerable. &quot;I... I 
need to... to taste you...&quot; she finally managed to get out, her own 
helpless inability driving her crazy. I smiled gently and let her go 
for a moment. &quot;Aino-chan, onegai...&quot; Hotaru panted desperately but 
her plea was cut short as I gently lowered myself on top of her, my 
own by now beyond anticipating clit right over her face.
	I gripped her butt again quickly as I shrieked from her 
tongue diving deep into my center before I could even fully lower 
myself down. Returning to my original destination, I bent over, all 
the while accompanied by the most pleasant sensation of my mate, 
working my center with both tongue and fingers.

(Hotaru)
Restlessly, I drove my tongue in and out of the divine flower 
pressing down on my face. If I had ever had any doubt that my mate 
was the true incarnation of the mythical Goddess of Love, it was 
swept away the moment I was blessed and granted to dip into the 
intoxicating, perfect taste of Minako&#39;s salvia. By all means, I could 
not really describe what it smelled or tasted like because my mind 
was just too blurred and occupied with the overall sensation of 
pleasure to form a single coherent thought. I reached up with one 
finger to slowly insert it into the welcoming entrance before me. 
Minako shuddered at the touch and she pressed down even harder 
towards my eager mouth - if that was even possible.
	My own arousal flared ablaze again as I felt Minako hands 
return to my butt, this time actually fingering my anus with the same 
exact manner of sharpness and precisely inflicted pleasure as before. 
That even heightened further as I felt her teeth on my sensitive 
flesh above, sending my own womanhood into a series of aches and 
pleasure. I decided to respond in kind and began sucking on Minako&#39;s 
own clit, softly but determinedly scraping her skin with my teeth. I 
was barely able to continue my own actions as Minako picked up her 
pace with fingers and mouth, sending my body in a sequence of 
shudders.
	Driven by hunger and desire, I felt the craving need in me to 
taste my mate for an instance overpowered by the necessity of 
completing the joining. Thoughts and actions weren&#39;t completely 
conscious and might not even be fully of my own as I flicked my 
tongue over her pleasure center and then withdrew a mere moment 
before I would have sent her over the edge. Instead, I returned with 
one hand, fingers drawn into a fist and slammed all the way inside of 
her. Accompanied by a tiny bit of gathered energy, since I didn&#39;t 
posses the natural and trained strength of Minako, I broke the wall 
with one clear thrust, sending my mate in possible delirium from the 
shock wave of losing her virginity - at least that&#39;s what it felt 
when she did it to me.
	Her muscles tightened around my fist and I gently moved it 
inside to soothe some of the pain. My own release rippled through me 
as Minako had instinctively shot her tongue into my own flower and 
her fingers deep into my anus from the jerk of her own orgasm. I 
grabbed her ass tightly and with one hand and then the other as 
Minako released it finally. She wasn&#39;t stopping her pleasuring and I 
was not going to deny her further pleasure either. Mere seconds after 
her first virginity-taking release ripped through my mate she already 
experienced her second, sending me into heaven as a result also as I 
clamped down hard on her clit again and began sucking uncontrollably. 
She filled me with a full load of her heavenly nectar that only a 
Goddess could truly posses and I felt blessed once again to be hers 
and she being mine.
	Both of us were unable to stop, the energy would probably 
have burned the bungalow down by now if it was of pure fire or 
electricity. With that not the case, it only drove us on and on to 
always new heights of ecstasy. The third release caught us both at 
the same time and I began digging my fingernails in Minako&#39;s ass, 
mirroring her own movements below with a frantic need to touch and 
deliver the same amount of painful pleasure. The fourth release I 
think was where we lost any remaining rational thought and the energy 
responded in kind, flowing all over as at once. We felt as one, as 
one whole being and as if we were touched in all places at once, our 
breasts being pressed, grasped and pleased although they were barely 
touching in our current position. Our tongue and mouth tasting and 
drinking from seemingly restless fountains of divine nectar, our 
fingers adding their own rhythm to the overall sensation by 
relentlessly diving in and out of our ani.
	It proved too much as our fifth release came shortly after, 
triggered by the sensation of being pleasured everywhere at once. The 
crackling energy enveloped us in a cocoon of blinding whiteness which 
made me close my eyes in bliss. Peace without precedent filled me 
inside and outside and washed away every dark feeling in me for the 
moment. It was like I stood naked before the world, pure and 
innocent, like a newborn infant. The sensation subsided slowly and I 
tried to hold on as long as possible before I finally settled back in 
the covers with a truly amazing sigh of contentment, Minako right 
beside me.
	After a few... minutes of regaining rational thought and 
simply bathing in the afterglow of our glorious mating, I felt my 
mate&#39;s arms go around me and pull me close against her. One hand 
softly stroking along my hair and her lips found mine in a gentle 
kiss. As she pulled back, her eyes were locked on mine and I thought 
I would be actually slain by the sheer intensity of the love 
radiating from them. &quot;I love you.&quot; I sighed yet again and reached up 
to cup her right cheek with my hand, Minako leaning into the 
touch. &quot;And I love you.&quot;
	With that we settled down and slowly surrendered to Morpheus&#39; 
arms&#39; sweet embrace. I think I did find my place today. The place 
where I ultimately belonged. No regrets, no fears, no pain - of the 
kind that wasn&#39;t inflicting pleasure. Just love. Unconditional love 
in all aspects and forms from one single person. The one, the only 
one that ever was and would be for me. My center, my confidence, my 
savior. My mate.
	With a final sigh of serenity, I closed my eyes.

If you actually read this I don&#39;t think I have to say anything more 
to this other then that nothing in the world could ever compare to 
this night&#39;s experience. Although... You probably figured that out 
already. Mating between two Senshi - even if one isn&#39;t aware of it 
and awakened - is a truly unique and exquisite experience that can&#39;t 
be compared to anything humanly imaginable. If you did yours already 
and all our worries prove to be needless then you probably know 
exactly what I&#39;m talking about. If not but you at some time ever plan 
to, consider this as helpful advice to prepare yourself for this 
night and not do it on any pitiful excuse of comfort or something. 
I&#39;m not saying I regret what we did, far from it, but it might be 
better if you are a little bit better emotionally stable at that 
time. Otherwise you might send Artemis (who to my never fading 
incomprehensibility slept through the whole thing) or anyone 
sensitive nearby running on a direct path skywards to the Moon. :)

Logging out, your now wet and desperately seeking her mate

Author&#39;s Notes

There. Done. My very first lemon. I think that it was okay for the 
first try, might be better the next time, might be not...
I have to say although I usually don&#39;t do writings that high-rated 
(but I read them, mind you) it actually was fun to write and a 
totally new... experience. Most of the mechanics with a yuri couple 
which are taking influence are from a wild variety of other fics, 
mostly though (because I get them almost daily) from the Buffy/Willow-
shippers. Granted I wasn&#39;t open-minded at the beginning of my ff-
author &quot;career&quot; towards NC-17 stuff because I thought it was 
mostly &quot;mindless fucking&quot;. But I think reading some of the more adult 
Buffy/Willow stuff and a few other yuris, I experienced that not all 
lemons (or whatever they are classified in the respective category) 
are quite that plotless. There are good ones that actually come with 
a decent, if not ,good plot. I don&#39;t say now that this is the 
majority, most are still favoring the &quot;mindless fucking&quot; part but 
there ARE some.
Now, if you accuse me of this having not much of a plot either, I am 
bound to agree with you. However, this is a special, an addition to 
the actual story. Truth be told, I could have simply added this to 
the end of Vol.4 or the beginning of Vol.5, but that would have just 
totally screwed my already unsure rating. If you like, you can copy 
and paste the whole thing to the end of Vol.4, if you are collecting 
the story in files. Just a suggestion. That is why there is no plot 
because it happens somewhere in the actual one.
One thing I have to say before I&#39;m finished considering the err... 
rather rough nature of sex in this special and the whole &quot;Senshi 
lust&quot; thing. The whole idea was inspired vastly by the B/W-shippers 
on www.chimerabloom.com and how the author describes the nature of 
The Slayer (especially in the actual part that is dedicated to the 
different dimension). I have to give my regards to the author for 
some great and steady work. Be sure to stop by and read some of her 
stories (especially the Original &quot;Predators&quot; is highly recommended).

After this quite long special (especially for only an extra bonus in 
between the last and next part) I&#39;m shutting up now and let you 
wander of to still your needs. :) Oh, did I say that it is not 
recommended to actually read lemons in your spare time at work... But 
your are probably not listening to me anyway since I&#39;m not doing it 
myself...

Vol.5 is already halfway through with the first beta-read release 
posted yesterday (July 4th on my Minaru-list - to which we REALLY 
need some more members). I hope to get it raw-finished over the 
weekend or by at least the middle of the week so that you should get 
it somewhere the following week.

Ja ne, yours

Matthias
