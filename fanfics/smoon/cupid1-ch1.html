<h1>The Cupid Alliance Series 1: The Trouble With Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Cupid Number 557 Omicron, also known as Urakaze, sat on his cloud and 
sharpened his arrows, sighing every so often.  The Omicron Group was 
currently in charge of Japan, a collection of about 4000 scattered 
islands off the east coast of Asia, filled with power and the reborn 
princesses of the Silver Millennium.  The Omicron Group was entrusted 
with the lives and loves of the most powerful women on the planet, and 
he had finally been given an assignment concerning the last princesses 
of the Silver Millennium.  And it wasn&#39;t the job he had anticipated.  
His best friend and former mentor, Cupid Number 374, Asakaze, joined him 
in a flurry of silky white feathers, her own quiver full.  &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong, Ura-kun?&quot;
 
&quot;Asa-chan, what would you say if I told you that I got an impossible 
assignment today?&quot;
 
&quot;Who is it, Ura-kun?&quot;
 
Urakaze pulled out two pictures, one of a tall blonde man with powerful 
emerald eyes and a distant expression, and the other of a smaller woman 
with wavy aqua hair and sea-colored sapphire-teal eyes.  Their ancient 
souls were evident even in the pictures, and Asakaze smiled as she 
realized that the Senshi were being assigned at last.  &quot;These two.&quot;
 
She was willing to play dumb for her former trainee, so she racked her 
brain for other information on the two.  &quot;Oh!  I know the woman!  She&#39;s 
that famous violinist, Kaiou Michiru.  And the man here looks like that 
famous Junior F-1 racer, Ten&#39;ou Haruka.  But aren&#39;t they a little young 
to be falling in love?&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka&#39;s a woman, and no.  Look.&quot;  Urakaze waved his hand, and the two 
woman changed to Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, two of the Senshi 
reborn from ancient times and destined to protect the Earth.  &quot;See?  I&#39;m 
told that my predecessor, Cupid Number 169 Alpha, got them together in 
the Silver Millennium, but it took So long and she had to break so many 
rules.  Remember that whole recombination of power lecture we had a few 
years ago?  It was because of what these two did back then.  She almost 
didn&#39;t make it before the Moon Kingdom fell.  And now I must do it 
again.  169 went into retirement after that feat, and no one&#39;s seen her 
since Rome fell.&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s your mother, right?  Can&#39;t you go find her?&quot;
 
&quot;She won&#39;t talk to anyone about these two, and I fear that I may not be 
able to handle this assignment.&quot;
 
&quot;They don&#39;t look so tough; I&#39;ve had harder couples to bring together.&quot;  
Asakaze switched into lecture mode, her tone of voice so familiar to 
Urakaze that he looked up and listened carefully.  His absent-minded 
nature often got him in trouble, but 374 had discovered when she was 
training the boy that certain tones of voice would keep his attention.  
&quot;The first thing to do is get them to meet.  I know that they&#39;ve been 
dreaming about each other because of their past, and maybe you can use 
that to your advantage.&quot;
 
Urakaze sighed as he stood, filled his quiver, lifted his bow, and 
straightened the absolutely ridiculous white loincloth and pale blue 
sash that constituted his uniform.  &quot;Then I will try.  Oh, when are you 
getting your next assignment?&quot;
 
&quot;Not for a while.  I requested the Moon Princess and Earth Prince, and 
that pair isn&#39;t being handed out for a while, at least until Luna is 
awakened.  So, I wait patiently and I&#39;m sending them dreams about their 
past.  Until their assigned, I can do everything possible to get them 
together short of shooting them with arrows, and I think I might try 
making them run into each other on a daily basis.  That way they won&#39;t 
be able to ignore each other, and when the princess and prince awaken, 
they&#39;ll be that much more open to true love.  When they are given out, 
the Council will see what lengths I&#39;ve gone to in order to make them 
meet, and I will get the job.&quot;
 
&quot;How long have you been planning this?&quot;
 
Asakaze grinned.  &quot;Only since Tsukino Usagi was born.  Good luck, 
Ura-kun.&quot;
 
&quot;Same to you, Asa-chan.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Urakaze sat on the top of Haruka&#39;s car, invisible to mortal eyes, 
watching as Michiru walked forward, dressed in her light blue school 
uniform, a sketchpad held before her.  One of his most important lessons 
from his trainee days was that the first meeting was The Most Important 
one, with capitals and everything.  Urakaze waited until Elza Gray 
stepped aside and Haruka had a clear view of her destiny.  One 
well-placed arrow, and . . . Haruka swung her bag over her shoulder and 
walked away, telling Michiru that she had no desire to be painted.  
Urazake sighed and watched the racer leave, knowing that the sparkle in 
Michiru&#39;s sapphire eyes was the love he had implanted weeks ago while 
the aqua-haired beauty had been watching Haruka race.  It had worked on 
Michiru, but Haruka seemed immune to the love arrow&#151;nearly impossible, 
but not unheard-of.  So Urakaze opened his wings and soared after the 
retreating blonde.  This was going to work.  He was old enough to know 
that there were many difficult cases but he was young enough to believe 
that everything would work out in the end.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka had no idea why she was on the cruise, but when she saw that 
Michiru was going to be playing on the ship, she felt an irresistible 
urge to hear her.  She listened to the violin song and the people 
talking around her, wondering why Michiru had no friends.  She suddenly 
saw a very different scene, one where she sat at a crystal piano in an 
exquisite suit and Michiru sat on the top, her long dress whispering 
every time she moved, her violin in her hands and a look of true 
tranquility on her delicate features.  She wondered if they really had 
ever played duet, and she looked up at Michiru, wondering why she had no 
friends, no partner in music, no partner in love.  But, deep in her 
heart, she already knew.  Michiru was the senshi from her dreams, Sailor 
Neptune, and that kind of destiny didn&#39;t leave any time for a social 
life.  Suddenly annoyed, Haruka left the dining room.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Michiru opened her eyes, looking up just in time to see Haruka leave.  A 
voice in the back of her mind&#151;or maybe right next to her ear&#151;whispered, 
&quot;go after her,&quot; and she obeyed.
 
She found Haruka looking at her painting of the end of the world, and 
she smiled, wondering if she should tell Haruka that she was falling for 
her.  But the conversation didn&#39;t lead there, it lead to Michiru telling 
Haruka that they had responsibilities as Senshi, the responsibility to 
stop the Silence.  She wanted Haruka to understand that they were 
partners, that they were the only ones who could stop the end of the 
world, but the blonde was too determined to lead a normal life to 
listen.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;I&#39;m losing her,&quot; Urakaze growled.  Pulling out his bow, he grabbed two 
arrows and let them fly, right into Haruka&#39;s back.  She flinched, just 
noticeably, and the fire in her green eyes flared to fury.  She stalked 
away, leaving Michiru alone on the stairs, and Cupid Number 557 sighed.  
He settled onto the landing beside Michiru and let his warmth flow over 
her, soothing shattered nerves.  &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; he whispered, letting the 
mortal hear him.  &quot;Everything will be alright.&quot;
 
Michiru laid her head on her arms and cried.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka zipped up her riding jacket, grabbing her bag and heading back 
into the building.  She paused when she heard someone crying for help, 
and she stopped inside the room as a boy morphed into a red monster 
covered in tentacles.  She backed away, afraid for the first time in her 
life, and a blue glowing stick appeared in front of her, just before the 
monster attacked her.  She reached out to take it, a siren song of a 
better life and a planet far, far away filling her mind, but a voice 
from the door stopped her.
 
&quot;If you take that, you will never again live a normal life.&quot;  Michiru 
stood in the light from the door, a stick held in her own hand.  Her 
voice, when she cried out her henshin phrase, was filled with pain and 
resignation and maybe tears.  &quot;Neptune Planet Power Make Up!&quot;  And 
Sailor Neptune from Haruka&#39;s dreams stood there, ready to battle.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Urakaze watched as Neptune saved Haruka, throwing herself between the 
blonde and the monster to save the racer&#39;s life.  She finished off the 
monster, laying in Haruka&#39;s arms, blood welling up from the deep gashes 
on her arms and back.  Haruka listened as Michiru admitted that she had 
been watching the racer, wanting to ride in her car along the beach, and 
Haruka looked at her henshin stick.  That would make her Sailor Uranus, 
Neptune&#39;s partner for as long as they lived, and she hesitated.  
Growling his annoyance, Urakaze let three arrows fly into the reluctant 
blonde, and Haruka finally responded to the urge.  She took the stick, 
determined to stay by Michiru&#39;s side, and Urakaze realized why these two 
were so difficult to get together.  They were afraid to ruin their 
mission with love.
 
Cupid Number 557 sat on thin air just under the ceiling, thinking.  374 
appeared beside him, watching Haruka pick Michiru up as the drained 
senshi detransformed and lost consciousness.  &quot;So, Ura-kun, are you 
going to tell me this big plan or am I supposed to guess?  Because right 
now your idea seems to be backfiring.&quot;
 
Urakaze grinned.  &quot;This could take some time, Asa-chan.  Ten&#39;ou Haruka 
is a tough target.  The Cupid arrows have already worked wonders on 
Kaiou Michiru, but both of them are afraid of letting their love ruin 
their mission.  They have to stop the Silence, and they won&#39;t let their 
emotions interfere.  They don&#39;t know that they are two of the three 
owners of the Talismans, and they won&#39;t relax until they find out.  They 
do love each other, but I won&#39;t be able to make them say anything until 
they are ready.&quot;
 
Cupid Number 169 Alpha appeared, no longer carrying a bow and quiver, 
wearing a gold dress and sandals instead of the white the Cupid job 
required.  &quot;Well, you finally figured it out, Urakaze.&quot;
 
&quot;I was wondering if you would come, Mother.&quot;
 
169, also known as Yuriko, smiled as she leaned back and watched her 
favorite couple leave.  &quot;They&#39;ll fall in love, I promise.  All you have 
to do now is nudge them in the right direction.  And Haruka is not 
immune to our arrows, just excessively resistant.  This is not an 
impossible mission.  Besides, you, my young son, did finally learn the 
most important lesson of being a Cupid.&quot;

&quot;Yep.  The problem with love is not that the arrows don&#39;t work; the 
problem with love is the lovers.&quot;</pre>
