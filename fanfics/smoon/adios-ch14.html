<h1>Con Su Adios, Usted Toma Con Usted Mi Co (part 14 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The day finally came when the senshi decided to go up against the 
queen bee herself, Beryl. The girls met at Rei&#39;s temple, making last 
minute adjustments to their plans.

&quot;So, today is the day,&quot; Minako said. &quot;We&#39;re finally gonna meet Beryl.&quot;

&quot;Rei, quick question.&quot; Usagi leaned on Rei&#39;s shoulders. &quot;You didn&#39;t 
forget to kiss Yuuchirou goodbye, did ya?&quot;

Rei groaned and Minako and Ami smiled.

&quot;Do you think Sailor Jupiter will show up to help us,&quot; Usagi asked. 
&quot;We may need her help.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t count on it,&quot; Minako said quietly.

&quot;So,&quot; said Luna. &quot;Are you girls ready?&quot;

Minako stood there. The others looked at her, waiting for the answer. 
She nodded slowly. &quot;Hai,&quot; she said sadly.

Artemis looked at her sadly. 

The girls removed their henishin pens and were ready. As they began to 
call out their names, someone stopped them. 

&quot;Wait!&quot;

The girls turned their heads and gasped.

Minako smiled, tears falling from her eyes.

~ So denied so I lied
Are you the now or never kind?
In a day and a day love
I&#39;m going to be gone for good again
Are you willing to be had? Are you cool with just tonight?~

&quot;Mako-chan!&quot; Minako ran to Makoto and threw her arms around the taller 
girl. &quot;I thought...I didn&#39;t think you were coming back.&quot;

Makoto hugged Minako tightly. &quot;I could never leave my Angel. I came to 
fight.&quot; She pulled away and wiped Minako&#39;s tears away with her hand 
gently. She smiled warmly and took hold of Minako&#39;s hand and the 
rejoined the group.

The others didn&#39;t know what to do. How could they transform with 
Makoto there?

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Usagi said nervously. &quot;Uh..can you come back later?&quot;

&quot;Why? I thought you were going to go fight Beryl today.&quot;

&quot;Yea we are but-&quot; Usgai, Rei, Ami, and Luna looked at Makoto in shock. 
&quot;NANI!? How did you know about that??&quot;

&quot;She knew because of me,&quot; said a voise above them. Ace jumped down 
from the roof of the shrine and landed and Makoto&#39;s shoulder. 

Ami looked at the cat. &quot;You&#39;ve been eves dropping in our 
conversation?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Ace said smiling. He jumped down to the ground. 
&quot;So, like Luna said. Are you ready?&quot;

Minako squeezed Makoto&#39;s hand. &quot;Hai.&quot;

The girls looked at her. &quot;Demo, Mina-chan,&quot; Ami said.

&quot;Venus Power, Make-Up!&quot;

In a flash of orange and yellow, Sailor Venus replaced Aino Minako. 
She looked up at Makoto who was smiling.

&quot;Damn...&quot; Venus giggled. &quot;Ok, My turn.&quot; Makoto removed her own 
henishen pen and thru the gasps of the others shouted, &quot;Jupiter Power, 
Make-Up!&quot;

Lightening flashed around Makoto&#39;s body. When it subsided, Sailor 
Jupiter stood in her place. The others were in shock.

&quot;You mean-&quot;

&quot;She was-&quot;

&quot;Sugoi!&quot;

&quot;Then, that means,&quot; Rei started. She and the others looked at Ace, who 
only smiled.

&quot;Hai. I am Yung Hu. Now, transform. You have a battle to fight.&quot;

~Here&#39;s a toast to all those who hear me all to well.
Here&#39;s to the night we felt alive.
Here&#39;s to the tears you knew you&#39;d cry.
Here&#39;s to goodbye tomorrow&#39;s going to come to soon~

The others transformed and afterwards the five senshi performed a 
teleportaion. Sailor Moon stood hunched over, trying to stay warm. 
They had been taken to the North Pole.

&quot;S-shouldn&#39;t we have gone some place warmer, like Tahiti,&quot; Sailor Moon 
asked thru chattering teeth. Jupiter smiled. 

Mercury activated her visor and did a scan of their surroundings. 

&quot;What do you have, Mercury,&quot; Jupiter asked, looking over her shoulder.

&quot;Its hard to tell. There is so much negitive energy here, I can pin 
point it&#39;s origin.&quot;

&quot;Hm...Try scanning for where the bulk of it is. Odds are, that will be 
the main point,&quot; Jupiter suggested. Mercury nodded and did as she was 
told. 

&quot;There,&quot; she said pointing towards a crater barely visable above the 
snow. &quot;I believe it to be coming from there.&quot;

Jupiter nodded. &quot;Good work. Did you guys hear that? We need to head 
over towards that way.&quot; The others nodded.

As they began to walk, an image formed in front of them. 

&quot;What is that,&quot; Venus asked.

&quot;Its Mamo-chan!&quot;

&quot;Sailor Moon! No,&quot; Mars cried out as sailor Moon began to run towards 
him.

Jupiter ran after her and tackled her to the ground. &quot;Wait, Princess. 
Mercury is doing a scan.&quot;

&quot;Its not him!&quot;

Jupiter quickly picked Sailor Moon up when she saw the figure smile 
evilly. Vines errupted from its chest and grabbed onto one of the 
senshi.

&quot;Jupiter,&quot; Venus cried out as she watched Makoto being pulled up into 
the sky by four, evil fearie looking women. &quot;Hold on! I&#39;ll get you 
down,&quot; she said thru tears. She would be damned if she lost Makoto 
when she just got her back only hours earlier.

&quot;Iie! You need to save your strength to fight Beryl! Don&#39;t worry..I&#39;ll 
be ok..&quot; She gave one last look at Venus before yelling out her 
attack.

&quot;Jupiter..thunder...Crash!&quot; A bright fireball exploded in the sky. 
When it subsided, Sailor Jupiter was gone.

~Put your name on the line
Along with place and time
Want to stay, not to go,
I want to ditch the logical~

&quot;We have to keep going,&quot; Mars said. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t want us to-&quot;

&quot;Shut up Rei,&quot; Venus cried out angerily. &quot;You don&#39;t know shit about 
Mako-chan!&quot;

&quot;Mina-chan...&quot; Mars said quietly.

Mercury watched the two then heard her scanner beep. Looking at it, 
she turned back to her friends. 

&quot;You guys, go on to Beryl. I&#39;m going to go check this out.&quot;

&quot;Mercury, iie,&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t split up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; she said as she turned and began to run towards the 
strange, new energy. When she got there, she saw Ryo tied up in 
chains. Mercury smiled. 

&quot;You&#39;re not Ryo! Show yourself!&quot; 

Silence.

&quot;NOW!&quot; The ground began to rumble as a giant fireball came out of the 
ground and swallowed Mercury. She stood inside the dome, when three of 
the women returned. They wrapped their vines around Mercury&#39;s waist 
and shot negitive energy thru her body...

Sailors Moon, Mars, and Venus were walking slowly towards the crater 
when an explosian rocked the ground. The girls stummbled and turned 
around to see a cloud of smoke.

&quot;Mercury,&quot; Sailor Moon cried out, falling to her knees, crying. 
&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Ami...&quot; Mars said to herself.

Venus remained silent, her head bowed. She looked up and saw a blood 
red light glowing underneath Sailor Moon. 

&quot;Sailor Moon! Watch out!&quot;

~ Here&#39;s a toast to all those who hear me all to well.
Here&#39;s to the night we felt alive.
Here&#39;s to the tears you knew you&#39;d cry.
Here&#39;s to goodbye tomorrow&#39;s going to come to soon~

Mars took hold of Sailor Moon&#39;s hand and ran as fast as she could.

&quot;Mars..Mars, please stop...&quot;

They were nearly to the crater were Mercury had told them to go. Mars 
stopped to catch her breath. 

&quot;I think you&#39;re suppossed to face Beryl alone.&quot;

Sailor Moon looked at Mars. &quot;Are you abandoning me?&quot;

&quot;Iie, Odango. Its just these doom and bloom chicks...I think they&#39;re 
too strong for me.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ll leave,&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;We&#39;ll leave and come back when 
we&#39;re stronger!&quot;

Mars smiled at Sailor Moon. Over the blonde&#39;s shoulder, she saw the 
last of the youma waiting for her. She hugged her friend and kissed 
her cheek. &quot;Its time for me to go.&quot;

She sidestepped Sailor Moon and walked towards the last bloom and doom 
girl. All Sailor Moon could do was turn around and listen to the 
battle...

~All my time is froze in motion
Can&#39;t I stay an hour or two or more
Don&#39;t let me let you go
Don&#39;t let me let you go~

&quot;....I....I remeber...&quot; Endymion said.

Sailor Moon smiled. After Mars had died, she had went to the crater 
alone, hell bent on killing Beryl for taking her friends from her. 
When she had gotten there, she was teleported to an ice tower by the 
Queen herself and forced to fight her love. 

Sailor Moon refused to hurt him. She instead, she tried to re-jog his 
memory. It had worked.

She was knealing in front of Endymion, holding *their* locket while it 
played *their* song. She smiled, tears running down her face.

&quot;All you have to do is touch it...&quot;

His hand slowly reached out and his fngertips brushed against the 
locket. His body arched as his body began to purify itself from 
Beryl&#39;s brainwashing. 

&quot;No,&quot; Beryl cried out. &quot;You traitor!&quot;

Endymion&#39;s body shifted back to Mamoru&#39;s as he fell to the floor. 
Sailor Moon opened her arms as he slupmed forward.

Mamoru smiled at Sailor Moon, who gladly returned it. They embraced, 
Sailor Moon&#39;s tears going from those of sadness to happiness.

&quot;Oh, this is so sweet,&quot; Beryl said, a giant ice crystal forming in her 
hands. &quot;I&#39;m getting cavaties!&quot; 

The two lovers looked over at the witch, and saw instead the crystal 
zooming towards them. Mamoru threw a rose which shattered the crystal 
and also stabbed the witch in her chest. She sank onto the floor, 
vanishing from sight.

&quot;Mamo-chan!&quot; Sailor Moon cradled Mamoru&#39;s head on her lap. When he 
shattered the crystal, shards went flying towards him and Sailor Moon. 
He covered her with himself, several of the shards stabbing him in his 
back.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; he said smiling up at her. &quot;I&#39;ll find a way back to 
you...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Please,&quot; cried Beryl. &quot;How can I defeat her!&quot;

&quot;Stop whineing Beryl! I&#39;ll help you this last time, &quot; said the voice 
of the Negaforce itself. &quot;Use it wisely!&quot; 

A purpleish-black ball of energy engulfed Beryl&#39;s body. Her eyes went 
wide as it hit her hard. She felt her body being over run by pure evil 
energy, and she screamed out in pain.

~Here&#39;s a toast to all those who hear me all to well.
Here&#39;s to the night we felt alive.
Here&#39;s to the tears you knew you&#39;d cry.
Here&#39;s to goodbye, tomorrow&#39;s going to come to soon~

Sailor Moon left tower in search of Beryl. She knew she was out there, 
waiting to take over the world. And then, there she was, with her back 
turned, laughing.

&quot;You better enjoy that laugh Beryl,&quot; Sailor Moon said. Beryl looked 
over her shoulder and then tunred to face Sailor Moon. &quot;It&#39;s gonna be 
your last.&quot;

&quot;Are you ready,&quot; The queen asked.

&quot;Lets go,&quot; Sailor Moon said calmly. Beryl shot a wave of enery towards 
Sailor Moon and ice consumed her. Beryl sneared. 

The ice then cracked and split open, forming a sort of platform. 
Inside was Princess Sereinty, clutching the moon wand close to her 
heart. &quot;I will defeat you Beryl,&quot; She said. &quot;In the name of the Moon.&quot;

&quot;You? Pititful lil&#39; Princess Serenity??&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Its getting colder,&quot; Ace said. He, Aremis, and Luna sat on top of 
Usagi&#39;s house, watching the night skies. The city had suffered a black 
out from the cold.

&quot;Maybe Beryl was too much for them,&quot; Artemis said. &quot;Luna, maybe our 
girls didn&#39;t make it...&quot;

Luna hung her head, tears streaming down her face. &quot; I can&#39;t believe 
that we&#39;ll never see them again.&quot; She looked back up, crying out, 
&quot;Sailor Moon! You&#39;ve just got to believe in yourself, PLEASE! Everyone 
is counting on you!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Princess Serenity lifted her head, narrowing them at Beryl. &quot;I hear 
you, Luna. I&#39;m not afraid anymore.&quot;

&quot;You should be!&quot; Beryl cried out angerily as energy flowed from her 
body towards Serenity.

The princess pointed the wand at the witch and said, &quot;Moon Crystal, 
Elimanation!&quot; A bright, silvery-white flowed from the wand towards 
Beryl, their attacks counteracting the others. They each gave all they 
had, but nothing was happeneing.

*Senshi..my friends..I need your help...*

Ami&#39;s face appeared in Sereinty&#39;s mind. &quot;Hey, Usagi. I&#39;ll help you 
with this assinment if you want.&quot; She flashed a smile and giggled.

Another vison came to Serenity. One of Rei. &quot;You&#39;re so stubborn, 
Odango! Let us help or I&#39;ll never speak to you again.&quot;

Then Minako. &quot;Yea, come on, Usa-chan. Still too many guys we gotta 
meet.&quot; She winked and smiled, giving her victory sign.

Lastly was Makoto. &quot;Hai, let us help. We haven&#39;t known each other long 
enough for it to end yet.&quot;

&quot;My friends...&quot; Tears streaked down her face as Serenity felt her 
friends essances near her. She felt each of their hands, one at a time 
take hold of the wand on top of hers. The she heard, 

&quot;Mercury Power, Make-Up!&quot;

&quot;Mars Power, Make-Up!&quot;

&quot;Venus Power, Make-Up!&quot;

&quot;Jupiter Power, Make-Up!&quot;

Serenity smiled weakly. 

&quot;Moon Prism Power, Make-Up!&quot;

The light from the wand exploded, engulfing everything. Queen Beryl 
was taken back.

&quot;What is this??&quot; Her eyes wide, she screamed in pain as the light 
sawllowed her, and killed her.

Serenity collapsed onto the ice, her friends now long since gone. She 
knew she would soon be joining them. As she closed her eyes, she 
whispered something only the gods above could hear, before her life 
faded out of exsistance...

~.....To soon...~

Luna, Artemis, and Ace sat on top of Usgai&#39;s house, laughing as they 
watched the blonde streak out of her towards school.

&quot;I bet she&#39;s late again,&quot; Ace said, smiling and shaking his head.

&quot;I bet you&#39;re right,&quot; Artemis said laughing as well.

&quot;How&#39;s Makoto-san, Ace,&quot; Luna asked.

Ace&#39;s smile faded slightly. &quot;She&#39;s fine. She got really beat up in 
that fight.&quot;

&quot;Does she..?&quot;

Ace shook his head. &quot;Iie, she doens&#39;t remember.&quot; He looked out over 
the neighborhood. 

&quot;...She doesn&#39;t remeber when she hurt so much...&quot;

::flashback::

Makoto sat in her jeep, watching the highschoolers file out of the 
school. One week..One week since that battle. Makoto still had a few 
bandages, but nothing too bad.

She smiled when she saw Minako&#39;s face come into view.

&quot;Mina! Mina-chan,&quot; Makoto cried out, crossing the street. The blonde 
girl turned around and looked up at Makoto, who smiled at her. 
&quot;Konnichi wa, Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako looked at her confused. &quot;How do you know my name?&quot;

Makoto looked at her shocked. &quot;Nani?..Don&#39;t you remeber me?&quot;

Minako looked at her, still confused. &quot;Should I?&quot;

*I must have been the only one...to retain my memory..*

Makoto swallowed her tears and smiled slightly. &quot;Gomen ne. I must have 
mistaken you for someone else.&quot; Makoto bowed in respect to her now 
lost love before walking away...

~ Here&#39;s to the night we felt alive
Here&#39;s to the tears you knew you&#39;d cry
Here&#39;s to goodbye 
Tomorrow&#39;s going to come to soon..~
