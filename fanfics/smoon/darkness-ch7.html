<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Hotaru&#39;s Hunt

Hotaru stealthily followed a women who looked to be in her early 
thirties. She had short brown hair that reached her cheek bones. She 
had on a jean outfit and some sneakers.

Hotaru stayed close to the woman, but not close enough for her to 
notice. Hotaru licked her lips in hunger as she saw no one in site 
except for the two of them.

Suddenly the woman turned around and stared at Hotaru. She shrieked as 
she saw Hotaru&#39;s glowing eyes and fangs. The woman whipped around and 
took off down the street in fear.

Hotaru smirked making her look demonic and took a different route. 
This way would be faster and she could corner her. The woman ran and 
stopped to catch her breath.

She looked around and didn&#39;t see Hotaru in sight. She sighed happily 
and prepared herself to walk. The women felt a hand on her wrist and 
looked down.

The woman&#39;s brown eyes widened in horror as she saw Hotaru looking up 
at her. Before the woman could react Hotaru jumped on the woman making 
them both tumble to the floor.

The woman kicked and screamed, but Hotaru held her down tightly. 
Hotaru bent down and sank her teeth into the woman&#39;s neck. The woman 
screamed in bloody murder and nobody was there to hear her.

Hotaru drank hungrily as if she had never tasted blood in her life. 
Soon the woman&#39;s breathing and heart came to a stop and Hotaru let her 
death grip loosen.

Once the woman was empty Hotaru stood up and licked her lips. She 
smiled as her eyes turned back to it&#39;s normal color and her fangs 
vanished.

Hotaru turned around to retreat back to the car to see her &#39;mama and 
papa&#39; and to tell them that she had succeeded.

She walked to the meeting point and indeed saw Amara and Michelle 
leaning against the car. Hotaru ran up to them excitedly.

Michelle smiled as she saw the little girl running up to them 
excitedly.

&quot;Well I can see that your hunt went well.&quot;, replied Michelle. Hotaru 
smiled which showed the two woman that they were right.



Rei&#39;s Hunt

Rei smirked as she followed a man who looked to be in his late 
fifties. He had unruly black hair and blue eyes. He had massive 
muscles and wore a white sleeveless muscle shirt. He had on badge 
pants and tan worker boots.

Rei cracked her knuckles in anticipation as the man kept up his normal 
pace. The man walked to an empty parking lot and to his white Mustang.

Rei hid in the shadows and began to walk closer. She surely didn&#39;t 
want her dinner to run away. Rei accidentally kicked a can that made a 
loud noise.

The man head shot up and darted his head from left to right.

Rei silently cursed under her breathe and with un-seeable speed, ran 
to the car. As the man was getting in Rei quietly jumped into the back 
seat of the man&#39;s car.

The man started to fumble with his key&#39;s until he found the right one. 
He put the key in, started the car and locked all of the doors. 
Suddenly he heard soft breathing and slowly turned his head around.

There sat Rei with her eyes beet red and fangs out to it&#39;s full 
extent. Before the man could utter a word Rei grabbed the man by his 
shirt and yanked him into the back of the car.

Rei jumped on the man and quickly sunk her teeth into the man&#39;s neck. 
The man struggled violently as he tried to throw Rei off of him. Rei 
kept a tight grip around the man and sucked every once of blood from 
his body.

Soon Rei sat on top of a lifeless man. She wiped the blood off of her 
lips with her fingers and then liked them clean. Rei unlocked the car 
door and looked around to make sure no one was around.

When the site was clear she jumped out of the car, slammed it shut and 
made her back to Amara and Michelle.

As she made it to the meeting area she saw her sister talking to Amara 
and Michelle.

&#39;Serena must still be on her hunt.&#39;, thought Rei as she walked to her 
&#39;parents&#39;.



Serena&#39;s Hunt

Serena was following a young guy in his late twenties. He had short 
blonde curly hair and wore glasses. He had on a colorful Hawaiian 
shirt with jean shorts. He also wore a pair of sneakers and baseball 
cap.

The guy had gone to several houses before he started walking somewhere 
with less people. Serena snuck around watching the guy intently.

She liked her lips and then brushed her tongue across the front of her 
teeth. The man turned around and Serena ducked into an alleyway so she 
wouldn&#39;t be seen.

When the man turned around Serena came out of her hiding and continued 
to follow. The man walked into an alleyway where he was met with 
another man.

The two men started talking as Serena smirked. This was great she 
could get two guys to feed on. Serena slipped into the alleyway unseen 
by the two men. She saw a large stick near a garbage can she was next 
to.

&#39;If she could knock one out than this would be easy&#39;, thought Serena. 
Serena picked up the stick and went to the two men who were facing 
away from her.

She raised the stick and whacked the man she was to hunt on the head. 
He dropped to the floor with a little thump as Serena turned to the 
other guy.

The man backed up in fear as Serena advanced towards him. Without 
warning she lunged herself towards the man making him stumble back and 
crash into the wall.

The man hollered as Serena sank her teeth into the man&#39;s neck. The man 
slid down the wall and landed on the ground heavily. In the new 
position Serena had better access to his neck.

Serena sucked the man dry and turned towards the unconscious man. She 
smirked as her eyes turned back to it&#39;s normal color.

&#39;It wouldn&#39;t hurt to have one more.&#39;, thought Serena with a devious 
smirk. She walked up to the man and decided to do a different 
approach. Instead of drinking him from the neck, she decided to sink 
her teeth into his wrist.

Serena bent down and lifted his left wrist and brought his arm to her 
mouth. She forced out her fangs and sunk her teeth into it. Serena 
tasted the warm sweet blood as it made it&#39;s way down her throat. 
Serena felt the man&#39;s arm twitch and she looked down at the him.

The man&#39;s eyes began to flutter open and Serena took her unoccupied 
hand and brought it to his neck. She tightly gripped his neck on his 
pressure point which paralyzed his movements.

The man&#39;s eyes were now fully opened and all he could was do was to 
watch as the little girl slowly suck out his blood. The man&#39;s eyes 
finally rolled to the back of his head and breathed his last breathe.

Serena dropped his lifeless hand and stood to her feet. She walked out 
of the alleyway to see an empty street. Serena smirked and made a mad 
dash towards the parking lot.

When she arrived she saw Amara, Michelle, Hotaru and Rei were talking 
quietly amongst themselves. She walked up to them casually and Amara 
stopped talking to look at Serena.

&quot;So Serena, how was your hunt?&quot;, asked Amara. Serena smirked.

&quot;It went really well. I actually got two people tonight.&quot;, said 
Serena. Everyone looked at Serena in surprise.

&quot;Two?&quot;, asked Michelle eyes wide in shock.

&quot;Yup, two.&quot;, said Serena. Amara broke into a grin and slapped Serena 
on the back.

&quot;Sweet!&quot;, exclaimed Amara. Everyone jumped into the car in the same 
position as before. Amara and Michelle in the front, Hotaru and Serena 
sitting by the car doors and Rei sitting in the middle.

The ride home was quiet as Amara looked into review mirror and saw the 
girls asleep. Hotaru had her head resting on Rei&#39;s lap as Rei had her 
head on Serena&#39;s shoulder. Rei had an arm draped over Hotaru&#39;s waist 
as Serena&#39;s arm was around Rei&#39;s shoulders. Serena&#39;s head was on top 
of Rei&#39;s and Rei had her other arm around Serena&#39;s waist.

Amara smiled at the scene and turned to look at her lover. Michelle 
was sleeping with her head leaning against the window. She had some of 
her aqua colored hair covering her face, hiding her peaceful features.

Amara was dying to brush away the bangs, but had to keep her attention 
on the road. Amara made it back to their layer and parked their car. 
Amara slightly nudged Michelle awake and the woman looked around in 
confusion and than looked at Amara&#39;s amused smile.

Michelle glared at her slightly and turned around to the kids. They 
were still sound asleep. Amara and Michelle got out of the car and 
went to the back seat doors and opened them up.

Amara picked up Rei and Serena as Michelle picked up Hotaru. The two 
women brought the kids inside the building, up the stairs and into 
their room.

They laid the children on their respective beds and stripped them of 
their clothing to put on their pj&#39;s. When they where done they tucked 
them in their blankets and walked out the bedroom door.

After Amara and Michelle went to their room the girls bedroom door was 
reopened. Who ever it was, walked into the dark room and walked over 
to Serena&#39;s bed.

A hand went down and shook the sleeping girl awake. Serena tiredly 
opened up her eye&#39;s which soon widened in shock.

&quot;Jet, Tray?!?!&quot; exclaimed Serena.</pre>
