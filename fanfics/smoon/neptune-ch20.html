<p>The gallery closed its doors for the night, art critics and admirers  raving about the young new artist in their midst. Michiru posed for  several photographs alongside her works before pulling out her violin  at the end of the exhibit in answer to a request by a French  connoisseur to display her musical talents as well. She seemed bright  and cheerful to everyone but Takaiyo, who'd been her roommate long  enough to see that behind her smiles there was something wrong.</p>
<p>As  they now got back to their dorm room and could at last talk candidly,  Takaiyo came over to her with a look of concern. &quot;Michiru-chan, are you  okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru sat down gingerly on her bed and looked up at the redhead. &quot;Okay? Why, what do you mean?&quot; she asked demurely.</p>
<p>&quot;I  mean that before you left the art gallery for a bit you seemed fine. A  bit distant maybe, but other than that you were fine. Then, after you  came back, you seemed stiff, as if you'd hurt yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  chuckled. &quot;Takaiyo, you're imagining things. Do you really think I  could've played the violin like I did back at the gallery if I was  'stiff?'&quot;</p>
<p>Takaiyo narrowed her eyes a bit. She turned around and  walked over to her dresser. Next to a small second place statuette she  and the other members of the Saint Agatha Academy Girl's Cricket Team  had won at the inter school junior finals was her lucky cricket ball.  She picked it up. &quot;Hey, Michiru-chan,&quot; she said as she turned around  and lightly tossed the ball to her roommate, &quot;Catch.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru was  taken off guard. She reached out with both hands and caught it, but the  action of doing so caused her face to contort in pain as she put strain  on her injured back and arm. Takaiyo came over and knelt down in front  of her, &quot;Michiru-chan,&quot; she said in a soft voice as she put her hands  over the artist's, &quot;What happened when you left the gallery?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  lowered her eyes. &quot;I... I slipped and fell,&quot; she said as she got up  from the bed. &quot;Now, please, let it go,&quot; she said as she passed the  cricket ball back over to her roommate. She ignored Takaiyo's worried  eyes as she walked out of the room and headed for the stairway to the  roof of the building. The sun had set, and as the stars started to show  themselves she reflected on the events of the day. Zultan and the Death  Busters had crossed the line this time, when they decided to change  innocent children into daemons. The change of tactic meant that no one  was safe, that the enemy was willing to stop at nothing to attain their  goals of bringing the silence.</p>
<p>Then, there was Haruka Tenoh.  Michiru brought her hand up to her forehead and allowed a groan as she  remembered all she'd confessed to the other girl. She practically came  out and said she was in love with her, even giving her the chance to  back away from her calling because of her feelings for her. Somehow,  after stalking the girl for months, attraction had turned to lust, and  lust had turned to love, and it frightened her because deep down she  knew it made her vulnerable.</p>
<p>According to Pluto, fate and destiny  had brought her and Haruka back together in this lifetime. Somehow, in  spite of the danger they'd face and despite her feelings for the racer  possibly being an Achilles heel, the thought that they were destined to  be together somehow gave her strength to carry on.</p>
<p>She turned  away from the night sky and headed back down to her room. Sleep would  not come easily to her, but she wanted to at least try to be well  rested for tomorrow when she and Haruka saw one another again. She  started to think of what would be best to wear for tomorrow, but  quickly set such thoughts aside. This wasn't a date, she reminded  herself. They were Senshi, chosen to find the Messiah and the talismans  before the Silence and the end of the world could come. She had to stay  focused.</p>
<p>She re-entered her room. After once more assuring  Takaiyo that she was fine, she changed into her nightgown and slipped  into bed.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>She turned away from the night  sky, the stars disappearing behing the heavy orange drapes of her  bedroom. How was she supposed to get to sleep tonight? She had no way  of knowing if Michiru was alright or not, or if she went to the  hospital after all.</p>
<p><em>&quot;You don't rely on anyone else. And you are always honest with your feelings.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Haruka changed into her pajamas and pulled back the covers on her bed.</p>
<p><em>&quot;I know more about you than you do.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The scene kept replaying in her head, over and over. She turned off the light and headed to her bed.</p>
<p><em>&quot;When I finally saw you and realized you were the one... I was so happy.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Haruka  stopped and took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. Part of her still  wanted to run away, to give the wand back and turn her back on it all.  The part that wanted to watch over and protect Michiru however was  growing, as was the part that wanted to see the violinist smile at her  again, and to hold her in her arms once more. Not like last time  though, when she was injured and Haruka was fearful for the girl's  life, but she longed to hold her under different circumstances. Say, in  a romantic setting, by candlelight...</p>
<p>Haruka knew where this was  going. She was going to have enough trouble getting to sleep tonight  without thinking of Michiru Kaioh's beautiful deep blue eyes, or her  long luxuriantly wavy sea green hair that reminded one of the waves of  the ocean, or those beautiful full lips. Haruka could feel herself  growing excited, a low throaty moan escaping her lips as her hands  slowly traveled south, her body seeking release. She had two choices;  give in, or get up and take a cold shower.</p>
<p>She gave in.</p>
<p>Several  minutes later, still shaking and with sweat beading on her forehead,  Haruka finally drifted off to sleep. The smile however didn't leave her  lips until much later.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Zultan inhaled  deeply on her cigarette as she pulled out a leather bag from the inside  of her tan jacket. She opened it to reveal the finger and hand bones of  a left handed man. Taking the bones out, she tossed them into the air,  watching intently as they landed on the floor with a clatter. She read  the bones, and smiled with glee. She'd hoped to simply demoralize  Sailor Neptune, perhaps even force the brat into killing an innocent.  But according to the bones the Senshi was seriously injured.</p>
<p>Zultan  began to cackle. The result was better than she'd expected. It meant  that she would be able to operate for a short time unobstructed. She  tossed her cigarette aside and began to make preparations for the next  day.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Michiru stood in front of the  administration building in a light blue skirt and cream colored shirt,  with a knit white sweater over the shirt. She also wore a pair of black  low-heeled pumps and the pearl necklace from the yacht party. A cool  wind blew past her, forcing her to put her hands in her sweater's  pockets as her wavy sea green hair blew wildly across her face.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  the wind turned warmer. Michiru smiled unconsciously as she heard the  sound of Haruka's engine before seeing the car. She swept the hair out  of her face as she looked to her right, her eyes meeting those of the  blonde behind the wheel as the convertible came to a stop. To her  surprise, Haruka got out of the car, walked around and held the door  open for her. She blushed a bit as she thanked her and got in.</p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; Haruka said as she got back behind the wheel, &quot;Where do you want to go to talk?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru hadn't thought that far ahead. &quot;I'm not sure,&quot; she confessed, &quot;Wherever you'd like.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka smiled and turned on the engine. She turned the radio on as well as they drove away.</p>
<p><em>...And  that was the classic tune &quot;Get Wild&quot; by TM Network. And now for the  news. Last night around midnight, a large gem was stolen from the Tokyo  natural history museum. A man and woman who were out on a date at the  time caught a glimpse of the thief, a young man in his late teens to  early twenties described as wearing a black Dracula cape, a Zorro mask  around his eyes, and a tuxedo and top hat. Baffled police have  nicknamed the unusual criminal Tuxedo Kam...</em></p>
<p>Michiru ignored  the rest of the news as she leaned back in the passenger seat, the wind  causing her hair to trail and billow behind her like a flag in a wind  tunnel. Looking over to her left, her eyes widened as she realized they  were driving on the road right next to the beach, just as she said  she'd always wanted to go with Haruka. A group of four seagulls flew  over the ocean, and in the distance she could make out a sailboat or  two. She looked over to Haruka, the driver's short blonde hair flying  in the wind. She didn't turn away from the road to meet Michiru's gaze,  but the slightest hint of a smile showed itself on her lips as she hit  the accelerator.</p>
<p>They continued on along the beach for a while,  the westerly wind carrying the scent of the ocean and causing Michiru  to feel nostalgic, but for what she wasn't sure. Suddenly the car  turned and headed down a side street. &quot;Where are we going?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Haruka smiled wider. &quot;You'll see...&quot;</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>&quot;An arcade?&quot; Michiru asked as she followed her companion.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  called 'The Crown.'&quot; Haruka explained. &quot;And we're not here to play at  the arcade. Come on, there's a restaurant and ice cream parlor in the  back.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka led the way, with Michiru following. The violinist  stopped abruptly when she saw something strange out of the corner of  her left eye. It was a Sailor V video game. She watched as two girls  stood in front of the game, a brunette and a blonde with her hair up in  ponytails. The blonde was playing while the other girl, whom Michiru  took to be her friend, looked on.</p>
<p>&quot;Wha...! No fair! He just killed me! Naru-chan, do you have any more change on you?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  was puzzled. Why would a fellow Senshi such as Sailor V promote her  existence by allow a video game of herself to be produced. For her  part, she'd done all in her power to operate in secret as Sailor  Neptune. Then again, Pluto did say her mission was different than  Sailor V's.</p>
<p>&quot;Waaaaaah!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, stop crying. Here, here's some change.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  turned away and hurried to catch up to Haruka. She saw the racer  waiting patiently for her by the entrance to the restaurant. The two  went in and found a secluded table near the back. The redheaded waiter  who took their order looked somewhat familiar to the violinist, though  she couldn't quite place his face. After he left, and making sure no  one was around to eavesdrop on them, the two began to talk.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Haruka began, &quot;Where should we begin?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru looked thoughtful. &quot;What would you like to know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure. Tell me about your parents.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  was surprised. &quot;Well, it has nothing to do with our mission, but... My  mother's name is Aoki. I seldom see her though, not since her third  marriage at least. My Father's name is Fujioka, but I last saw him when  I was six, right around the time of the divorce. Yours?&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka  let out a bit of a sigh. &quot;My mom's name is Masae and my dad's name is  Kaname. I last saw them a few months ago, when they disinherited me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Disinherited you?&quot; Michiru asked, &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because  I cut my hair and stopped pretending to be someone I'm not,&quot; Haruka  answered. An uncomfortable silence settled in as the blonde looked down  at her hands, avoiding Michiru's sympathetic gaze. Finally, she looked  back up. &quot;So, care to explain why my friend's brother turned into a  monster?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru sat back in her chair. &quot;There's a group known  as the Death Busters,&quot; she began, &quot;Who are trying to bring about the  end of the world through something called the Great Silence. What it  is, or how they plan to accomplish it, I don't know. I know that there  are talismans we have to find, and a messiah as well, but not much  more. Unfortunately it's like I'm only getting bits and pieces of the  big picture, and it feels like trying to piece together an elaborate  jigsaw puzzle at times.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka narrowed her eyes as she studied the other girl closely. &quot;There's something you're not telling me.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  nodded her head reluctantly. &quot;You're right, there is. The talismans are  hidden within innocent people with pure hearts. In order for us to  obtain the talismans the... The owners of the talismans must die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here  you are,&quot; the waiter interrupted as he brought the two orders over. As  he left, Haruka lowered her voice. &quot;Then what you're talking about  is...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Michiru interrupted, &quot;And I hate it to, but  consider the alternative. Every living thing on Earth will be destroyed  if we don't. And you've seen yourself that they'll stop at nothing. I  wish there was another way too, but...&quot; at that moment, the violinist  accidentally knocked over a glass of water the waiter had placed in  front of her. It splashed against her, soaking her shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;Here,&quot;  Haruka said as she shuffled her chair over and reached over with a  napkin, &quot;Let me get that.&quot; She bent over and began to wipe the water  off Michiru's chest. Looking up, she saw her deep blue eyes staring  intently at her. She felt warmth welling up within her, and from the  blush on the other girl's cheeks she could tell Michiru felt it too.  She swallowed hard, trying to ignore the scent of roses. &quot;We... Can't  be doing this, can we?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru took a deep breath and nodded as  she leaned towards Haruka, watching the blonde's teal eyes looking back  at her longingly. &quot;You're right. We have a mission.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can't complicate things,&quot; Haruka whispered huskily as she came closer still to the other girl.</p>
<p>&quot;We  have to stay focussed,&quot; Michiru muttered as her lips brushed against  Haruka's, &quot;We...&quot; she was cut off as Haruka's lips pressed against  hers, the racer's hands reaching up to frame both sides of her face and  entwine her fingers into the artist's aquamarine hair. She reached up  as well, cradling the back of the blonde's head as she opened her mouth  slightly. Haruka took the cue and deepened the kiss, both girls loosing  themselves in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>She  hid the professor's box beneath a wooden crate, her own features hidden  behind clown makeup and a multi-colored wig. As a large crowd of both  adults and children gathered around her on the sidewalk, she stepped up  onto the crate.</p>
<p>&quot;Free balloons,&quot; Zultan called out, holding out a  large bundle of red balloons, each sporting a black five pointed star.  &quot;Come get your free balloons!&quot;</p>
