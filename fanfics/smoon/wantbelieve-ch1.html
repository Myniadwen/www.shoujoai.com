<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dark Side of the Moon<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Mars! Retreat!” The blonde warrior collapsed to her knees, clutching her head in pain. </em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The senshi of fire hesitated. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That’s an order, Mars!” It was the last thing she barked before falling face first into the dust of the dark side of the moon.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Venus!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus’ name was on Rei’s lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  damp, dark hair framing the porcelain curves of her face, the young  woman found herself sitting bolt upright on her futon, clutching her  pillow to her chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Covered in a cold sweat, she inhaled a  shaky, uncertain breath as several raw emotions flooded her.  Hesitation, urgency, and duty mingled within the confines of her mind,  but it was fear that threatened to overpower her, a fear unlike any she  had ever known.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the details of the dream that had caused it  evaded her. The remnants of the vision were murky at best, and she  couldn’t fathom what had frightened her so terribly. As a senshi, Rei  had fought many horrifying enemies, had prevented dire futures from  coming to pass, and had even faced her own death.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yet all those emotions paled in comparison to the fear that gripped her heart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly,  her fingers loosened their hold on the pillow held before her and  finally, her breathing returned to normal. A practical woman by nature,  Rei eventually laid back down. A random nightmare, she was sure its  traces would fade once she settled back into the calming atmosphere of  her modest miko’s room in the shrine high in the mountains of Kyoto.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Time  passed, however, and the miko could not find sleep. The shadows of the  night slowly shifted with the blue-silver light of the setting moon.  Even the soft sound of a cold, late fall breeze rustling through the  bare canopy of the towering maples did little to ease the lingering  anxiety she felt. Pulling her covers to her chin to ward off the chill,  she turned to her side. Her mind’s eye granted her a view of the world  outside her room; a koi pond was surrounded by a small rock garden, a  hedge of boxwood meandered tranquilly along an age old footpath between  the shrine buildings, a bamboo container caught water flowing from a  well, overflowed, emptied, and then filled once more. The landscape in  her head had been carefully planned and staged to create harmony, but  still, her mind could not find peace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Was that really Venus I dreamt of?’</em> Rei wondered. <em>‘And if it was, then why do I feel so uneasy?’</em> Granted, the miko had never felt particularly comfortable thinking  about the leader of the senshi, though it was an act she found herself  doing often enough…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko reined her wandering mind away from  uncertain territory. There was currently another priority to think of,  though unfortunately, it still included the damnable Aino Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wearing  her uneasiness like a skin that she couldn’t shed, Rei’s instincts  finally overrode her initial decision to let the barely remembered  dream fade into forgetfulness, and swiftly, she rose from her bedding  and dressed in her miko attire. Never one to sit idly when a challenge  was presented, she marched out of her living quarters, hugging her arms  closely to her as her padded feet quietly criss-crossed the covered  walkways towards the meditation room. The silver light of the moon lit  her way and her warm breath made its presence known on the cold air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shutting  the thin, sliding door behind her, the faint embers that had been left  from the day’s use in the firebox cast an ethereal glow in the small  room. Rei set about her prayers and then began the ritual of starting  the fire. With a practiced ease, she set the flames roaring; sparkling  and crackling with a life all their own. Finally, she stepped back,  bowed before the altar, clapped her hands twice, and knelt down before  the sacred flame.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was in this position before the sacred fire  that the miko felt most comfortable, most in control of her self and  her surroundings, but now, even this position did not ease the fear she  felt. With an unmatched determination, she concentrated on that fear,  stared it in the eye and tried to pin it down, to define it and to  conquer it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the fear proved to be a worthy adversary, even  for the shrine maiden’s advanced skills that she had come to this  shrine far in the mountains to hone. It did not want to be caught or  examined under Rei’s critical eye. It dodged her advances, hid in the  darker recesses of her mind, and slipped out from underneath her thumb.  All of this made Rei track it harder, until finally, she sensed that  she was getting closer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The familiar aura of the fireroom and the  sweet, musty aroma of the burning wood suddenly shifted, and abruptly,  her nostrils were filled with the biting stench of a sulfurous  atmosphere. In a panicked rush, Rei gasped and choked on a mouthful of  the stinging air before forcing herself to regulate her breathing to  short, shallow breaths, but never once did her concentration or  determination waver.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Next, the amber glow behind her tightly  closed eyelids changed, revealing an alien landscape of towering grey  cliffs that stood like jagged teeth set against a black sky. A heavy  mist closed in around her, shrouding her in a murky haze. A violent  wind howled relentlessly, buffeting frigidly against her body, whipping  her dark, waist length hair and her short, red skirt behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Here, Rei understood, she was Sailor Mars.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  senses went on full alert as the sounds of a struggle reached her ears.  No more than fifty feet from her position, an eerie golden glow caught  her eye. It seemed alive, snaking out and wrapping mercilessly around  an ominous dark form that fell to the ground heavily, sending clouds of  dust flying across the surface of the barren terrain. Mars’ eyes  narrowed as a feminine figure that held the other end of the glowing  weapon then leaped to engage the creature in hand to hand combat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  signs of the struggle caused Mars’ heart to skip a beat. Despite the  darkness and the mist, despite her lack of knowledge of her  surroundings, she ran towards a hauntingly familiar voice that seemed  all too desperate to end her battle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A dangerous feeling of déjà  vu washed over Mars in a torrent and a chill ran down her back as  recognition and understanding finally set in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  voice was a mere whisper, but somehow, her commander heard it. The  golden light provided by Venus’ Love Me Chain was just enough to show  Mars the extent of the seriousness of her wounds, and even the hardened  Martian warrior found herself shocked at the damage her leader had  taken.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus looked at her subordinate with a pleading  expression, one eye wrenched shut in pain. “Mars! Retreat!” Her voice  broke as she doubled over and collapsed to her knees, her hands  clutching at her head, though it had seemed as though her head was one  of the few uninjured areas of her body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From the shadows of the  cliffs, more youma crept onto the battleground, convening towards  Venus. The senshi of fire, confused and fear-ridden, hesitated. Should  she join the fray or follow her commander’s will?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s an  order, Mars!” Venus barked violently before the blonde warrior’s  caramel eyes rolled into the back of her head and she fell face first  into the dust of the dark side of the moon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The fear that Mars  had been harboring rammed into her like a tangible force. As the youma  charged Venus’ prone body, she noted only belatedly that the sudden  illumination that lit the battlefield in tongues of reds, oranges and  sparks of bright white-blue light were born from herself as the flames  of Mars consumed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The panic within her reached its breaking  point and Mars’ distressed voice broke as it crashed against the  surrounding rock walls. “Venus!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bloodlust enveloped the raven  haired warrior as she charged the youma, drawing them away from her  leader. The first of the monsters that came within range was met with a  mere Burning Mandala, and she knew instantly, as the monster shriveled  up and died in the flames of her fury, that it wasn’t that Venus had  met her match in her attackers, but that something else had waylaid her <em>first</em>. In a blind and reckless fury, Mars dispatched the remaining six misshapen creatures.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wasting  no time, she turned to locate her leader. Breathing heavily, despite  the sting of the sulfur laced atmosphere and the minor cuts and bruises  she’d received from the skirmish, she dashed back to collect Venus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Only…  though she was still where she had last seen her, her unusually prone  form turned away from Mars, her face down in the dust, Venus hadn’t  gotten up… and she <em>wasn’t moving</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars fell to her knees on the blood covered ground. Shaky hands reached out to touch her leader...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  suddenly, before she could make contact, Mars was forcibly pushed back,  violently slammed into a rocky outcrop behind her. The force of the  impact had reduced her back to her civilian persona, and with the  absence of her senshi strength, the pain and fear Rei felt was  amplified tenfold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When the dust settled and she’d regained her breath and opened her eyes, she was met with herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Standing  between herself and Venus’ fallen body, Sailor Mars stood to her full,  proud height, her strict posture stiff and unyielding. Her expression  was dangerously blank. Her dark brown eyes were cold, yet tinged with  red. It could have been the biting winds, but to Rei, it looked more  like she’d been crying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should not be here.” She barked, and  Rei, confused, flinched at the intense pain that laced the voice of the  mirror image of alter ego.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s concern for Venus overrode the  confusing appearance of Sailor Mars. She stepped to the side to try to  see her, but as if she had commanded it, the mists had closed in behind  the senshi of fire, creating an impenetrable barrier. “But, Venus… is  she going to be alright? I have to know-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Mars took a step  forward. Her hands balled into fists and her words came out short and  clipped. “You must leave this place now. It’s for your own good. You  should not have seen as much as you have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Mars’ brows met. She almost snarled. “Leave! Now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The winds howled and the mists that lingered behind the warrior rushed towards Rei, enveloping her in frigid blackness-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  a shock, Rei opened her eyes and found herself back in the fire room.  The flames before her flared briefly, reaching outwards as if to singe  her, and upwards, almost lapping at the ceiling of the small room,  before dying back down to its normal size.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Besides the quiet  crackle of the burning wood, the only sound in the room was the miko’s  labored breathing. Her body shook with exertion. A fine sweat covered  her skin and her legs had fallen asleep. She uncurled her tightly  balled fists. Her fingernails had broken the skin of her palms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  eyes widened at the small drops of blood on her hands and her body  shuddered at the remembered fragments of the terrible image the fire  had shown her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus…” She whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Only, as she found  herself searching for the details of what she’d seen mere seconds ago,  she asked herself why her leader came to mind. Unlike dreams, the  images that the sacred fire showed her weren’t supposed to fade.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But wasn’t that exactly what was happening?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  as hard as Rei tried to trace the loose ends of the fading threads that  were the vision, they slipped out from under her mental fingers,  evading her, until finally, all she could remember for certain was that  the fire had shown her that <em>something</em> had happened to Venus,  something that had frightened her terribly, and that herself, as Sailor  Mars, had prevented her from understanding what had happened next…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">and whatever <em>had</em> happened next, it was something she <em>wasn’t</em> supposed to see.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pained expression on Sailor Mars’ face as the warrior had forced her  out of her own vision stuck in Rei’s mind. Why? Why had Sailor Mars  forced her away?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More confused and frustrated than she’d been  when she’d first woken up from the initial nightmare, Rei rose.  Unseeing, unfeeling, her instincts guided her through her familiar  surroundings as her tired body unsteadily made its way back to her  room. Barely managing to slide the door shut behind her, she fell to  her knees in front of her dresser and began rummaging through it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  length, she pulled out a small, pink cell phone that heralded the days  of her youth. Her thumb caressed the plastic shape and brief memories  of her active duty as a senshi danced at the edge of her consciousness.  She longed to delve into them, to reassure herself that she had no  worries, that everything was as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Venus!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">An  echo of her own voice in her ear, her slim frame shook as a  disconnected wave of fear washed over her. Things were never so simple  when it came to Aino Minako, was it?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She flipped the Teletia S  open, and contemplated calling her leader. Her finger hovered over a  button she could find by heart. But then… what would she say to her?  Even though she and Minako had become friends again Usagi had reset the  world and they had all been reunited – a friendship that proved to be  even closer than it had been during their senshi days, even though they  maintained contact while the popular idol was touring the world, Rei  was afraid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She checked the clock. It was three in the morning.  Though they’d spoken at even stranger hours, considering the time  difference between them, she knew she’d be interrupting Minako’s busy  schedule. More than that, with the memories of her dream and her vision  continuing to fade from her memory, though Rei couldn’t deny that just  talking to the annoyingly frustrating woman would at least make her <em>feel</em> better, what more could she tell Minako than that she’d had a dream that something bad had happened to her?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>But was it a dream?’</em> Rei asked herself, still staring at the phone in her hands. <em>‘Or was it a premonition? A threat of something to come?’</em> Her finger lighted softly on the number one key, Minako’s speed dial, barely touching it. <em>‘If it is a threat, Minako should be alerted.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pink piece of plastic slipped through her fingers, landing softly on  the straw mat at her knees. Unheeding, Rei looked up, catching her  reflection in the mirror.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead of her own troubled frown that  she expected to see, the blank expression of the Sailor Mars of her  vision glared back at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You should not have seen as much as you have.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  chill ran down Rei’s spine as she remembered Sailor Mars’ determination  to keep her from discovering what lay hidden behind the mists.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>No. It’s not a premonition of the future.’</em> Rei realized with a sudden understanding. <em>‘It’s a memory of the past…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her shaky hand reached out to the ghostly image of Sailor Mars.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>The past is coming back to me.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">o    o    o</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Authors Notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  fic takes place in the PGSM universe, and is set after the events of  the Special Act. Though you don’t have to have prior knowledge of the  PGSM universe to read along, for those of you who haven’t seen it, what  are you waiting for?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The title of this fic, I Want to Believe in Someone, was inspired by Kitagawa Keiko’s (Rei’s) PGSM image song, Sakura Fubuki:<br />
      <em>Kamisama nante inai, (God doesn’t exist,)<br />
        Dakedo dareka shinjitai. (But I want to believe in someone.)<br />
    </em>Those two lines really struck me. And I think we all know who we’d like to believe that Rei is singing about when she says <em>She</em> wants to believe in someone. So, pardon the dorky title, but you’re stuck with it.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chapter 2 Preview:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Now,  into the dressing room with you.” Minako giggled melodiously, the  caramel highlighted hair that framed her face falling back behind a  shoulder as she pulled both Reiko and the garment into the row of  dressing rooms.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The flimsy stall door snapped shut with a  click and the slightly taller of the two women hissed as she realized  her companion had locked herself into the small space with her.  “Minako, what are you-”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her words were silenced by the  other’s lips and Reiko purred into Minako’s mouth as the decievingly  strong body of her leader pushed her back into the mirror. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Minako…”</em></span></p>
