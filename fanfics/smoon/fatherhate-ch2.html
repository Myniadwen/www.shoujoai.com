<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sunflowers.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The perfume of sunflowers filled her head almost lulled her into another eight hours of sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sadly, her body rejected that idea almost as fast as she rejected a plate of canned asparagus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Groggy,  Rei opened her eyes and noticed that Usagi was fast asleep beside her.  In fact, she noticed as she turned her head, the girl was close. Very  close. She gulped and noted that if she moved her even a tiny bit, they  would touch.</span></p>

Cinnamon.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The smell of cinnamon tickled her nose, in turn, making her mouth water at the memory of cinnamon rolls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wait. She never had cinnamon rolls….then what smelled like—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi  blinked her eyes open and noticed that she was no longer laying on the  cold floor of the meditation room. And Rei was no longer curled up in  her arms. She sat up and looked around, bleary-eyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-chan?” she called. The sheets that pooled around her waist smelled faintly of cinnamon. <em>Ha. Bet Rei’ll flip when I tell her that she smells like cinnamon rolls. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  slid from the bed and walked out of Rei’s bedroom, past the kitchen and  living room, and out of the main entrance to see Rei dressed in a fresh  pair of miko robes and dutifully sweeping the steps in practiced  swipes. Her back was turned and she appeared to be lost in her own  little world.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Perfect!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi tip-toed to the still  unaware Rei, took in a deep, yet silent breath, prepared to unleash a  loud yell and scare the living day-lights out of Rei—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t even think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  shout escaped her in the form of a raspberry as she pouted. “How did  you know?” she whined. Rei turned and grinned that infuriating grin of  hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m psychic, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi moaned in defeat. “I guess I’ll never be able to surprise you then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei smiled softly. “You surprised me last night.” Usagi’s eyes widened at the confession.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did?” she whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm-hm.”  Silence, companionable and warm, disturbed only by the bristles of the  broom, filled the air between them. Rei quickly dared a glance at the  unusually silent moon-hime, only to see the girl’s grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Rei asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, Rei-chan, let’s go to a fair or something.” Usagi suggested, her grin still plastered to her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh? Why? “</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  never spend any quality time, y’know?” Usagi began to whimper slightly,  poking out her bottom lip and making it trembled for the added effect.  Rei gave a long, over-dramatic sigh and relented.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yay!”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  afternoon was spent in bliss; Rei had much more fun than she expected  she would. And, she admitted to herself with a blush, having Usagi  cling to her arm during the haunted house escapade was a big plus.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So when the duo swaggered into the shrine well past ten, Rei  surprised Usagi by grinning widely and proclaiming, “This was the best  day ever!” Usagi giggled and looped her arms around her friend’s waist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  glad you had fun today Rei-chan.” Usagi said softly, looking up and  giving the faintest of smiles as she peered through lidded eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Whether  it was from exhaustion or perhaps it was from last night, but Rei felt  the slim control she had over her emotions slip. She reached out and  cupped Usagi’s soft cheek in her palm. To her shock, a pleasure, Usagi  gave a little sigh and leaned into the touch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usa…” Rei murmured, leaning down. Usagi looked up and closed her eyes, wanting the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then it happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They kissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was electric, like fire racing down both of their spines to curl their  toes. Scared of the emotions the moon-hime invoked in her, Rei pulled  back with a gasp. Usagi growled and pulled her back down again, sealing  them together once more with a vengeance. A sense of vertigo washed of  them, making both of their hearts slam against their ribcages. They  parted again, if only to gulp in air. Rei’s breath came out quicker  when she realized all she could breathe was Usagi’s scent of  sunflowers. She threw her head back, not even wincing when it collided  with the door she was slumped against, needing to breathe.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  Rei,” Usagi whispered as she took the chance to lay a soft kiss under  the girl’s chin. “Do you know how long I’ve wanted to get in your  heart?” The miko shuddered violently at the thrilling sensation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My heart’s not a place someone like you should be in,” she murmured. “Not someone as pure as you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why would you say that?” the blonde mumbled, trailing butterfly kisses down Rei’s neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  got a pitch black heart Usa.” Rei screwed her eyes shut against the  waves of shivers that bombarded her form. “At least, it is compared to  yours—“ She was cut off when Usagi kissed the nape of her neck harshly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  say things like that.” Usagi hissed, tightening the grip on Rei’s  waist. “That’s not even remotely true Rei and you know it. You’ve got a  beautiful heart Rei-chan; I love its warmth and its light…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  that declaration, Usagi stood and practically yanked Rei to her feet.  Rei stumbled, shocked at her leader’s assessment of her heart. Tears  sprang and Rei bit her lip to keep them from falling. Something had  been released as soon as Usagi’s lips had touched her own, and this  strange new feeling twisted her common sense and her longing until they  were blended and her mind was a whirlwind of emotions that were both  frightening and unfamiliar. Her fragile string of control and her own  sanity snapped with a mental twang as she uttered a very small cry and  pulled Usagi close, crushing their lips together again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei lead  them to the entrance to her bedroom and kicked the door closed behind  her and she knew, without a doubt even as they tumbled to the bed, that  this was going to be the biggest mistake of her life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it was a beautiful mistake.</span></p>
