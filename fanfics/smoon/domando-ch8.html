<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 8 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The song is called &#39;In Your Eyes&#39; and is from the Project A-Ko 
soundtrack. I don&#39;t own the song nor SM.

Downtown Tokyo was bustling with activity. Everywhere, teenage girls 
were coming and going out of dress shops, packages in their hands.

Aino Minako, despite her girlfriend&#39;s objections, was one of those 
girls.

&quot;Mina-chan,&quot; Makoto whined. &quot;Why did you drag me along for this?&quot;

Minako giggled from inside the dressing room. &quot;You&#39;re taking me to the 
prom, right?&quot;

Makoto nodded, knowing Minako couldn&#39;t see her. &quot;Hai, Mina-chan. I am. 
But your prom isn&#39;t from another three months. Why are you buying your 
dress so early?&quot;

&quot;So I can get it over with.&quot;

&quot;Still doesn&#39;t explain why you brought me with you,&quot; Makoto said, 
crossing her arms in defiance. &quot;You know I hate shopping.&quot;

&quot;I wanted you to see my dress,&quot; Minako said cheerfully.

&quot;Why couldn&#39;t you surprise me?&quot;

Minako sighed from inside the changing room. &quot;If you hated shopping so 
much, why did you agree to come with me?&quot;

&quot;Because you asked me, too. Besides, I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have been here 
for over three hours.&quot; Makoto sighed again, her left eye twitching. She 
loved Minako, but she hated shopping. She never understood women who 
took hours for shopping, when what they wanted could have taken less 
than thirty minutes to pick out and buy.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said, stepping out of the dressing room. 
&quot;I just wanted to spend some time with you, was all. With finals for 
school coming up and college enterance exams, not to mention fighting 
the new enemy, I&#39;ve just been busy. I&#39;ve had hardly any time with you..&quot;

Makoto sighed and stood from her waiting chair and took the dresses from 
Minako. &quot;Its alright. You can just make it up to me.&quot; Makoto winked and 
looked at the four dresses Minako had been trying on. &quot;So, which one did 
you want?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Minako said. &quot;They&#39;re pretty, but the one I want I can&#39;t 
afford.&quot;

&quot;Which one did you want?&quot;

&quot;That one,&quot; Minako said, pointing to a dress on a rack by itself. It was 
silver, with thin spagetti straps to hold the dress up on the wearer. 
There were two slits on each side of the dress. They looked to go up to 
mid thigh.

&quot;If you want-&quot;

&quot;Iie, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said. &quot;You can&#39;t afford it, either. Even if you 
could, I can&#39;t ask you to buy that for me.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to ask. Consider it an early birthday present.&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said in protest.

Makoto smiled and hung the dresses up and walked over to pick the silver 
one up. She walked back over to Minako and held it up to her body. 
&quot;Looks like it would fit you...&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan...?&quot;

Makoto seemed to be thinking. &quot;Go try it on. If it fits, I&#39;ll buy it.&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan...&quot;

&quot;Go, before I change my mind.&quot; Makoto smiled at her girlfriend, and 
Minako smiled as she jumped up and placed a quick kiss on Makoto&#39;s cheek 
before quickly returning to the dressing room.

&quot;So she ended up buying you the dress,&quot; Rei asked Minako.

Minako sipped at her shake. &quot;Hai she did. I still can&#39;t believe I let 
her tho...&quot; Minako blushed as Rei and Usagi giggled. Ami sat there, her 
nose in a book, ignoring the conversation.

&quot;Ya know, Minako,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;You should invite Makoto to our girl&#39;s 
day out. She&#39;s a girl.&quot;

Minako giggled and nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve tried. But she won&#39;t come out with me 
on these cause, lets face it, she wouldn&#39;t have much fun.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, she wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Rei said. &quot;It would be like you dragging 
Mamoru along with us.&quot;

&quot;He woulnd&#39;t enjoy himself,&quot; Usagi said, realizing what Mianko had meant 
about Makoto.

&quot;So, did she buy your shoes and everything else to go along with the 
dress,&quot; Rei asked.

Minako blushed and nodded. &quot;Hai she did. I wish she wouldn&#39;t have tho.&quot;

&quot;Why not? She loves you enough to do it,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Oh I know that. But she just spoils me and she doesn&#39;t have to.&quot; Minako 
placed her chin in her hands and smiled. &quot;Sometimes I think I don&#39;t 
deserve her-&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right. You don&#39;t.&quot; All heads turned to Ami, who was now placing 
her book in her bag. When her face raised, she was spittng daggers at 
Minako.

Minako blinked. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re agreeing with me, Ami-chan. You 
usually act like you hate Mako-chan. Whats the change?&quot;

Ami continued to glare at Minako as she stood from her place at the 
table. &quot;Thinking about things, nothing has changed. Except that you 
stole the most precious thing from me.&quot;

Minako blinked again, completly confused. &quot;What did I steal from you?&quot;

Ami picked up her bag. &quot;Makoto.&quot; And before walking away from three very 
confused girls, Ami added, &quot;And I will get her back.&quot;

Looking in your eyes
How I hope that you will see my heart
That our lives will meet
Never have to part

Feelings here inside
How I wish the world would go away
All would disappear
But you and I would stay
And I&#39;d be forever be in your eyes

&quot;Um, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako asked while laying on Makoto&#39;s couch, reading a 
magazine.

&quot;Hai, Mina,&quot; Makoto answered from the floor. She had taken her 
playstation from her bedroom and hooked it up to the living room tv for 
Chibi Usa to play while she was there and had yet to take it backto her 
bed room.

&quot;Can I ask you something and get an honest response?&quot;

Makoto paused her game and turned her head to look up at Minako. &quot;Sure. 
Everything alright?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;

Makoto smiled warmly up at Minako. &quot;You can ask or tell me anything, 
Mina-chan. I won&#39;t be upset or angry. And I&#39;ll try very hard to 
understand. Whats up?&quot;

&quot;I was having lunch the other day with the girls-&quot;

Makoto groaned and turned back to her game. &quot;You mean that girl&#39;s day 
out shopping extrsavaganza you keep trying to drag me on?&quot;

Minako couldn&#39;t help but to giggle. &quot;Hai, that. Anyway, Ami said 
something thats really gotten me upset.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Makoto said, still facing her game.

&quot;She said that I didn&#39;t deserve you and that I stole you from her. Is 
that ture?&quot;

The controler dropped from Makoto&#39;s hands. &quot;She said, what?&quot;

&quot;That she had you first...&quot;

&quot;That little...&quot; Makoto jumped up from her place on the floor and took a 
seat next to Minako after she sat up. &quot;Mina-chan, how much of the Silver 
Mileenium do you remember?&quot;

Minako shook her head. &quot;Not much. Mostly the last battle.&quot;

&quot;Do you remember if you and I were together?&quot;

Minako shook her head.

&quot;Well...We were. But before that, Ami and I were a couple. We were even 
going to be married. But things..changed. And, even tho I cared about 
her, I couldn&#39;t be with her any more and thats when I chose you.&quot;

&quot;But you two never in this life time,&quot; Minako asked, seemingly feeling 
better.

&quot;You were my first and my only, Mina-chan. I&#39;ve never been with another 
girl, dating or otherwise.&quot;

Minako smiled and hugged Makoto tightly. Makoto hugged Minako in return.

&quot;I love you, Mako-chan.&quot;

Standing in the dark
Wanting only to be next to you
Shine your light on me
Nothing else will do

Deep inside my heart
I believe that you and I could be
Friends forever more
Through eternity
And you&#39;d see me forever in your eyes

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re doing this, Minako,&quot; Makoto said as Minako 
finished tying Makoto&#39;s neck tie.

&quot;Why? You were in on my birthday, I wanted to be in on yours,&quot; Minako 
said smiling.

&quot;Minako,&quot; Makoto whined.

Minako giggled. &quot;Besides, you can&#39;t back out now. Everyone is on the 
living room waiting for us.&quot;

&quot;I could back out...&quot;

&quot;You do and I&#39;ll be really mean and not give you your present later.&quot; 
Minako smiled while several emotions played across Makoto&#39;s face. 
Giggling, Minako took hold of Makoto&#39;s hand. &quot;Come on.&quot;

Leading Makoto out of her bedroom, Minako walked out to her living room, 
which was quite bare. Everything in Minako&#39;s apartment was packed up 
into boxes except for her bed room. In two weeks, Minako would be moving 
in with Makoto.

Sitting on bean bag chairs and stools were Usagi, Rei, and Ami. Along 
with them were Yung Hu in his human form and in his lap was Chibi Usa.

As Makoto entered the room, they all called out, &quot;Happy birthday, 
Mako-chan!&quot; Makoto smiled but glared at Minako playfully.

&quot;You owe me,&quot; she whispered into the blonde&#39;s ear. Minako giggled.

A few hours, presents and slices of cake later, the group was still at 
Mianko&#39;s cutting up and carring on. Yung Hu and Chibi Usa were playing 
Minako&#39;s Gmaecube, Rei and Usagi were fighting over the last slice of 
cake, and Minako and Makoto were dancing to music only they could hear 
in a far cornor.

&quot;So,&quot; Minako said. &quot;How does it feel to be twenty four?&quot; Her hands were 
playing with Makoto&#39;s hair as she spoke, getting a slight purr in 
response.

&quot;I feel no different,&quot; Makoto answered.

Minako smiled. &quot;Have a happy birthday?&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai, I did. Thank you.&quot; Makoto leaned over and placed a 
kiss on Minako&#39;s head and before she pulled away she heard a click and 
saw a bright flash of light. Pulling away, Makoto glared at Rei and 
Usagi.

&quot;Ok, who has the camera?&quot;

The two of us together
I see it in my dream
Nothing could tear us apart

Through any kind of weather
Its always you and me
Together we can stand the test of time

Ami drove to her home that night, and climbed the stairs to her room. As 
she opened her door, she saw Sailor Jupiter standing there.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; she said in slight shock. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Ignoring Ami&#39;s question, Makoto powered down and asked her own. &quot;Why did 
you threaten Minako, Ami?&quot;

Ami blinked before realizing what Makoto was talking about. &quot;Why does it 
concern you?&quot;

Makoto&#39;s eyes twitched. &quot;Because it was about me! Ami, I don&#39;t get you. 
When you first met me here, you hated me when you found out I was a 
lesbian. Then you started liking me when you realized we use to be 
lovers in the past. What is the deal with you? Why do you hate gay 
people so much?&quot;

Ami stood there shocked. No one had bothered to ask her that before. &quot;My 
father.&quot;

&quot;Your father? What&#39;s he got to do with anything?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s the reason I hate gay people. He left my mother for a man. And he 
doesn&#39;t want anything to do with me now.&quot;

&quot;That makes him a bad father. Don&#39;t you dare take it out on me nor 
Minako.&quot;

&quot;I just want you back, Mako-chan,&quot; Ami said, her voice breaking.

&quot;Why? So you could treat me like you did in the past? I know thats what 
would happen. I refuse to go there again. Besides, I don&#39;t love you like 
that anymore.&quot; Makoto walked past Ami and opened her bedroom door and 
closed it behind her after she left Ami&#39;s room. A few seconds later she 
heard her front door open and close.

Ami sighed. Shaking her head, she stripped out of her clothes and and 
into her nightgown.

Feelings here inside
How I wish the world would go away
All would disappear
But you and I would stay

And I&#39;d be forever be in your eyes

Makoto smiled as Minako continued to die while playing the Sailor Senshi 
game. Growling, she finally gave up.

&quot;Thats it, I quit. I&#39;ll never be able to play this stupid thing.&quot;

&quot;Why would you want to? You actually live these adventures.&quot;

&quot;Godo point.&quot; Minako looked up at Makoto&#39;s tired face. &quot;Mako-chan? You 
feeling alright? You look sick.&quot;

&quot;I feel it. I&#39;m fine, Minako. I&#39;m jsut very tired.&quot; Makoto slumped down 
on the couch and laid her head on Minako&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Keep playing your 
game.&quot;

&quot;Have yo ubeen to the docter yet,&quot; Minako asked, restarting her game.

&quot;Hai, and they are just as clueless as me.&quot; Makoto&#39;s eyes began to drift 
close. &quot;I go for some tests in a couple of weeks.&quot;

&quot;Good. This has gotten me worried.&quot; Minako kissed the top of Makoto&#39;s 
head. &quot;Do you wanna go to bed, Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Iie, not right now. In a little bit, maybe.&quot;

Minako nodded and conitnued to play her game.

The two of us together
I see it in my dream
Nothing could tear us apart

Through any kind of weather
Its always you and me
Together we can stand the test of time

Minako woke up the next morning, earlier than she usually did. Quietly 
pulling away from Makoto&#39;s embrace, Minako showered and dressed, and 
wrote a note for Makoto telling her she&#39;d be back later.

Walking outside of the apartment building, Minako got into her car and 
drove to Rei&#39;s temple. Something was wrong with Makoto and she was 
afraid it was something medical science couldn&#39;t figure out.

Pulling up in front of Rei&#39;s shrine, Minako sighed as she climed up all 
the stairs. As she finally climed up the last one, she saw Rei already 
busy with chores.

&quot;Konnichi wa, Rei-chan,&quot; Minako called out.

Rei looked up and blinked. &quot;Morning, Minako-chan. What brngs you here so 
early?&quot;

&quot;I was wondering if you could do me a favor after you were finished with 
your chores?&quot;

Rei nodded. &quot;Sure. WHat?&quot;

&quot;Makoto&#39;s been suffering from terriable headaches and I have a feeling 
its something docters won&#39;t be able to figure out.&quot;

Rei nodded in understanding. &quot;So you think maybe a fire reading could 
figure it out?&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot;

Rei nodded a third time. &quot;Hai, I can do that. I wonder why I never 
thought about it. For as long as I&#39;ve known Makoto, she&#39;s complained 
about having headaches.&quot;

&quot;How long have you known her Rei,&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;oh..I&#39;d say about three years.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d you guys meet anyway?&quot;

Rei smiled. &quot;Well, I was bored one night and I logged onto my computer 
and surfed for chat rooms. I accidently went into one that was for 
lesbians only and started getting harassed for being straight. Makoto 
came to my rescue and we just started talking. She flirted alot, but she 
never once tried anything.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like Makoto. Trying to be all heroic.&quot;

Minako and Rei giggled.

&quot;She&#39;s a great person, Minako,&quot; Rei said. &quot;I hope you two last for a 
while.&quot;

Minako smiled. &quot;I hope we last longer than a while.&quot;

Rei playfully whacked Minako with her broom. &quot;You know what I mean!&quot;

&quot;Yeah. yeah, yeah.&quot;

&quot;Go back home, Minako. I&#39;ll do a fire reading tonight and I&#39;ll let you 
know what I come up with, alright?&quot;

Minako nodded and waved goodbye. &quot;Thanks, Rei-chan. See ya!&quot;

&quot;Ja!&quot;

Standing in the dark
Wanting only to be next to you
Shine your light on me
Nothing else will do

Deep inside my heart
I believe that you and I could be
Friends forever more
Through eternity

And you&#39;d see me forever in your eyes</pre>
