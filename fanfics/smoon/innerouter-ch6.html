<h1>Inner Crisis, Outer Conflict (part 6 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/innerouter-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Sailor Neptune looked around the ruins of Silver Millenium. She moved 
towards the crystal palace, with Sailor Pluto trailing her. 

&quot;What are we looking for?&quot; Pluto did not realize she had spoken out 
loud. 

&quot;A clue, a confirmation.&quot; Neptune answered. She felt a little lost 
without her mirror, so strongly had she come to rely on her Talisman. 
Being separated from it was damaging her body, as well. she could feel 
her strength running out of her, as it had when Eudial had taken her 
Talisman away. But this time it wasn&#39;t Eudial who was killing her. It 
was Haruka. She shook that thought away as she approached the Crystal 
Palace. 

Pluto walked through the ruined gardens. Unshed tears glimmered in her 
eyes. &quot;It was all so beautiful,&quot; she whispered. She passed down the 
garden paths into the main part of the palace. Neptune was nowhere in 
sight. Hurrying now, Pluto followed the path that Neptune would have 
to have taken. She couldn&#39;t hear any sound coming from the rooms 
ahead. Pluto broke into a run. Coming around the corner of the 
passage, Pluto came to a halt as she found Neptune collapsed on the 
floor. 

&quot;Neptune!&quot; Pluto screamed. Neptune clutched her chest, shaking. Pluto 
lifted Neptune off the floor, holding her in her arms. &quot;Neptune!&quot; 

Neptune looked at her. &quot;I can&#39;t be here, Pluto. I&#39;m here somewhere 
already.&quot; She fell back limp and unconscious. Pluto lifted her up and 
carried her to a settee along one wall. 

&quot;Neptune don&#39;t die,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;Haruka will kill me if you die.&quot; 
She laughed bitterly. &quot;Damn you Haruka.&quot; 

Neptune opened her eyes and smiled. &quot;She always was the most stubborn 
of us. Don&#39;t blame her, Pluto. She has her own destiny to follow.&quot; 
Neptune&#39;s eyes closed again. Pluto felt for a pulse. It was weak, but 
it was there. 

&quot;Hold on Michiru. Just hold on.&quot; Pluto laid Neptune&#39;s head on a 
cushion and ran off down the hallway. 

&quot; &#39;I&#39;m here somewhere already,&#39; &quot; she said.&quot; Pluto gripped her staff. 
&quot;I have to find her.&quot; 

********** 

Uranus looked out into the swirling mists. She saw two feet in front 
of her. Looking up, she could see dark eyes glowing with hate, glaring 
down at her. 

&quot;Get up!&quot; Titania demanded. Uranus didn&#39;t move. &quot;Get up!&quot; her 
once-lieutenant screamed. Uranus got to her knees. Pains wracked her 
body, but she ignored them and stood, looking her assistant in the 
eyes. 

&quot;Titania, what is this about? Have I done something to wrong you?&quot; 
Uranus&#39;s voice shook, but it was cold, angry. 

Titania laughed. &quot;What have you done? You have abandoned me! You have 
left me to freeze here, unloved, unnoticed on this barren place. Why 
did you call me?&quot; She grabbed Uranus by the collar. &quot;Why did you bring 
me into understanding just to abandon me?&quot; Titania shook the weakened 
Senshi. 

Uranus stared, aghast. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;You made me to love you and you never even looked at me!&quot; Titania 
spat into Uranus&#39;s face. 

&quot;I did what?&quot; Uranus was finding it hard to concentrate around the 
pain. &quot;What are you doing to me?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m doing to you what you did to me.&quot; Titania hissed. &quot;I&#39;m drawing 
all the life out of you, out of your planet. I&#39;ll stop when you and 
this micro-kingdom of yours is lifeless and cold. Like me.&quot; Her voice 
lowered and cracked with emotion. 

Uranus blinked, trying to focus. &quot;Oberon loves you...&quot; she managed. 

Titania threw Uranus down to the ground. &quot;Oberon loves you! They all 
do! And you too obsessed with your precious Neptune to see it. You 
leave us alone here to do your work, while you go visit her. You leave 
me...alone!&quot; 

Uranus was fighting for breath now. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Titania. I didn&#39;t 
know...I...this won&#39;t get you my love...&quot; she gasped. 

Titania sneered. &quot;I don&#39;t want it anymore. All I want from you is your 
death!&quot; She drew an arm back and screamed with rage. Uranus tensed 
herself to feel the impact of the attack. 

&quot;Deep Submerge!&quot; the cry echoed in the fog. Titania reeled back as the 
attack hit her. Uranus felt herself being lifted up. She took a deep 
breath and stood on her own. As Titania staggered, she sould feel the 
pain ease. Uranus lifted an arm. 

&quot;World Shaking!&quot; The blast sent Titania backwards. Uranus bent over 
double, regaining her breath. Neptune leaned down quickly. 

&quot;I was watching you in the mirror.... Can you handle her?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Uranus answered. 

&quot;I&#39;ll get help&quot; Neptune said and disappeared. 

Titania stood and faced Uranus. The Senshi felt power returning as 
Titania&#39;s will was broken, her intent turned from taking the energy of 
the planet. 

&quot;Titania...don&#39;t do this.&quot; Uranus straightened to her full height. 
Titania looked at her, despair and hatred written plainly on her face. 

&quot;Go ahead. Do it. Kill me.&quot; Titania laughed coldly. 

Uranus shook her head. 

&quot;Not even that. Well then....&quot; she lifted her arm and hurling an 
attack at Uranus, rushed her. Without realizing how, Uranus found 
herself holding her sword, Titania bearing down on her. Titania threw 
herself on Uranus&#39;s sword and slid down, crashing to her knees. 

&quot;It&#39;s not enough,&quot; she said, and died. </pre>
