<h1>True Destiny (part 6 of 10)</h1>

<a href="../smoon/trudest-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;Michiru-san!  What a surprise!&quot;
 
The aqua-haired artist chuckled as she and the tall man embraced 
briefly.  &quot;Ken&#39;nin-kun.  It has been a while.  How are you?&quot;
 
&quot;You know, the usual.  Running Tohoku has never been an easy job, though 
my cousin, Kazeko, made it look so very easy.  Oh well.&quot;  He bowed as he 
invited the four women into Tohoku Castle, watching the tall blonde as 
she walked past him.  Curious, he stepped in front of her and bowed.  
&quot;Hello.  I&#39;m Aomori Ken&#39;nin, Regent Duke of Tohoku region.&quot;
 
Haruka straightened up, her bearing more regal than she would ever 
admit.  &quot;I am Ten&#39;ou Haruka, orphan, former fighter at Kurai&#39;s Tokyo 
Fighting Palace.&quot;
 
&quot;Ten&#39;ou Haruka,&quot; Ken&#39;nin whispered.  &quot;You&#151;you can&#39;t be her.&quot;
 
&quot;You mean Ten&#39;ou Koshu and Ten&#39;ou Kazeko&#39;s daughter?&quot;  Ken&#39;nin nodded, 
Michiru watching the exchange with some interest.  &quot;I am she, though I 
barely remember anything of my life from before that car crash.&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin looked at Michiru wildly, desperate for her to deny Haruka&#39;s 
words.  &quot;She is Kazeko&#39;s only daughter.&quot;
 
&quot;Then she . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin fell to one knee, head bowed, at Haruka&#39;s feet.  &quot;Then you are 
our Duchess, Haruka-san.  You are the ruler of Tohoku Region.&quot;  Haruka, 
a little shocked, stared at the man at her feet, looking up at Michiru 
for prompting.  She didn&#39;t know what to so or even how to act like a 
ruler of any kind.  Michiru gestured that she should have Ken&#39;nin rise.
 
&quot;Please stand up.&quot;  Ken&#39;nin rose, and Haruka let herself smile.  &quot;I 
didn&#39;t come to take away your throne, Aomori-san.  I just wanted to meet 
my family.&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin placed his hands on Haruka&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;Then, Haruka-san, 
since we are family, there is no need to be so formal.  I do not out 
rank you; I am not even your equal, so please call me Ken&#39;nin, not 
Aomori.  And you don&#39;t have to want the throne; it reverts to you 
instantly now that you are back in Tohoku.  It&#39;s yours.&quot;
 
Haruka reluctantly followed Ken&#39;nin into the throne room, never noticing 
that Makoto and Michiru both watched her leave.  Makoto clenched her 
fists and turned away, while Michiru kept staring, wondering why she 
felt an urge to follow Haruka.  What had they been in their past lives 
that she was so desperate to be with Haruka?
 
Haruka looked at the golden throne, eyes on her cousin.  &quot;Ken&#39;nin-kun, I 
do not want that throne.  I do not want to be duchess.&quot;
 
&quot;I understand how you feel, cousin.  I never wanted to be Regent Duke; I 
was never trained for this eventuality.  But it happened, and Tohoku has 
prospered under my rule.&quot;  Aomori Ken&#39;nin stopped before reaching the 
throne, recognizing Haruka&#39;s unwillingness to go any farther.  &quot;How long 
has it been since Michiru-san rescued you and Kino-san from that 
fighting palace?&quot;
 
&quot;A few days.  I&#39;m still getting used to eating on a regular basis and 
bathing every day and not being punished for sitting and thinking for a 
few moments.  I don&#39;t know if I would be doing this region a favor by 
taking over.  You know more about this place then I do, and I think it 
would be better for me to finish learning how to be a normal person 
before I have to be a duchess.  I hope you understand.&quot;
 
&quot;You want me to remain regent a while longer.&quot;  Ken&#39;nin smiled, and 
Haruka felt herself relax.  &quot;Of course I understand.  But now that 
you&#39;re here, you must appoint me regent in a public announcement.&quot;
 
&quot;You mean, if I say it, that you&#39;re regent, they will accept that?&quot;
 
&quot;Of course.  That&#39;s what power means.  And besides, they will also 
understand.  Any thing you say in Tohoku from this day forward is law, 
unless it contradicts the Queen&#39;s laws.  Do you see?&quot;
 
&quot;I think I do.  I&#39;m used to being powerless; this is a lot to handle.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it,&quot; Ken&#39;nin assured his cousin.  &quot;Now, on to 
business.  I have prepared a midday feast to celebrate the arrival of 
Duchesses Hino and Kaiou; that is a fine place to introduce you.  All of 
the Lords and Ladies of import will be there and the media, despite our 
best attempts, always manages to attend every important function.  All 
of Tohoku will know.  There you can announce that, because of your past, 
you would prefer to continue your tour of Japan with Duchess Kaiou than 
instantly begin your duties as Kazeko&#39;s daughter.  Simply tell them that 
once you are satisfied that you are fit, you will return to begin your 
training to be our Duchess.  We must find you a dress.&quot;
 
&quot;A dress?  Ken&#39;nin-kun, I do not want to wear a dress.&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin nodded and led his cousin out to the other visitors.  Michiru 
and Makoto looked up, but Makoto looked away and walked to Rei&#39;s side.  
&quot;All of you, I give you access to our clothes, our servants, and our 
baths so that you may prepare for the formal evening meal I have ordered 
to commemorate your visit.  Michiru-san, please see if you can convince 
my cousin to don a dress for the meal.  I will send the servants to 
escort you to your temporary rooms.&quot;  He bowed and left.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka glared at the servant woman who measured her for the dress, 
glancing up at Michiru with pleading eyes.  &#39;Help me,&#39; her gaze begged.  
&#39;Please.&#39;
 
&quot;You&#39;ll like the dress, Haruka-san.&quot;  The servant bowed and left the two 
duchesses alone in the room.  Michiru smiled at Haruka in the shift the 
servant had managed to get onto the blonde.  &quot;You&#39;ll look very pretty in 
a dress.&quot;
 
&quot;I hate dresses.  You don&#39;t understand, but a dress makes you vulnerable 
and I don&#39;t want to be vulnerable.&quot;
 
&quot;You can&#39;t let anyone past your shell.  You&#39;re afraid that if people see 
the real you they won&#39;t like you and they won&#39;t accept you.  If they 
think that you&#39;re a man, for instance, they will treat you differently 
than they would treat a woman.&quot;
 
Haruka nodded, confused.  &quot;Yes.&quot;
 
&quot;So you pretend.  You pretend to be a man, to be strong, to be a 
painter, a violinist, a normal person, happy.  You pretend to flirt with 
men when all you can see is the beauty of the women all around you that 
you cannot have because it is not right for the First Duchess to be a 
lesbian.  And the more you pretend, the more you tell others that you 
are a certain person, the more you begin to believe it until you no 
longer even know who you are.&quot;  Haruka realized somewhere very early in 
that passionate speech that her aqua-haired partner was talking about 
herself, and she moved forward to wipe the tear off Michiru&#39;s cheek.  
The shorter duchess let out a choked sob and let Haruka wrap her arms 
around her, tears flowing freely.  &quot;Haruka, I&#39;m so alone.&quot;
 
&quot;Shh, Michiru.  Please, calm down.  I don&#39;t care that you&#39;re a lesbian, 
and none of the things I&#39;ve seen through your shell frighten me.  You 
don&#39;t have to pretend with me, Michiru.&quot;
 
The aqua-haired woman nodded and wiped her tears, looking up from 
Haruka&#39;s breast.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to dump my 
problems on you.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m here for you when you need me.  Why do you paint, Michiru?&quot;
 
&quot;To forget those dreams.  I don&#39;t want to fight and kill and die.  I 
just want to be a normal duchess, be the duchess that my mother has 
become.  I want to be attracted to men, I want to marry a man, but I 
know that I&#39;m not normal.&quot;
 
&quot;There is nothing wrong with being attracted to women.  Do you think 
there is something wrong with me?&quot;
 
&quot;No, of course not!&quot;
 
&quot;Yet I&#39;m a lesbian.  My people don&#39;t have to understand or accept 
because this is not an elected position.  Neither is yours.  The people 
of Kanto can be upset at you, but they cannot disown you.  And certainly 
none of your fellow future duchesses will be upset at you.  I mean, it&#39;s 
fairly obvious that Rei-san is gay, Minako-san is at least a bisexual, 
and Setsuna-san is accepting of both of them.&quot;
 
&quot;What about Makoto-san?&quot;
 
Haruka backed away from Michiru, arms crossed defensively across her 
chest.  &quot;I don&#39;t know about Mako-chan.  We aren&#39;t speaking at the 
moment.  She wants me to decide how I feel about her.&quot;
 
&quot;And?&quot;
 
&quot;All I know is that I love her, but I think I would love my little 
sister the same way.  She wants me to love her live Rei-san loves 
Minako-san, and I don&#39;t think I do.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka, you two may not be destined for each other, but everyone is 
destined for someone.  Just give I time and let true love find you.  And 
Makoto-san, whether she is your soul mate or not, will be there for you 
when you&#39;ve figured it out.&quot;
 
&quot;What about you?&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
Haruka shook her head, looking away from her friend.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry; I 
really wasn&#39;t thinking.  Anyway, you&#39;d better go to the room Ken&#39;nin-kun 
gave you to get ready for the party.&quot;
 
&quot;Why?  I can just as easily get dressed here.  Unless you feel 
uncomfortable with me in here?&quot;
 
Haruka swallowed and shook her head.  &quot;No, that&#39;s fine.&quot;  In the depths 
of her mind, where no one would hear, Haruka groaned.  &#39;Is she trying to 
drive me crazy?  Because it&#39;s working!&#39;
 
&#39;Yeah, well, maybe she knows that,&#39; Haruka&#39;s inner voice laughed.  &#39;Look 
at her; she&#39;s gorgeous.  I think she wants you to notice her.&#39;
 
Haruka passed a hand over her face as she realized that she might no 
survive in Michiru&#39;s company much longer.  Gaining control of her 
emotions, the tall blonde sat down on the huge bed and tried her best to 
ignore the gorgeous woman sitting beside her.  Her inner voice just 
laughed at her feeble efforts.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;And now it is my greatest pleasure to introduce the newest arrivals to 
Tohoku, the reason we are having this feast in the first place.&quot;  
Ken&#39;nin, dressed in finest suit of white and gold, smiled at the 
gathered nobles, deciding that he had delayed the very important 
introduction long enough.  Smiling, he gestured for the guests to enter 
one at a time.  Hino Rei was first, as always a stunning powerful sight.  
She wore a long crimson dress edged in gold and shimmering in the light.  
Her dark raven hair shone, sparkling with strings of tiny black and red 
stones, and she smiled at the stares she received.  &quot;I present Hino Rei, 
young duchess of Kinki Region.&quot;  She sat as the next of Ken&#39;nin&#39;s guests 
entered the room.  Michiru, as always elegant and graceful, nearly 
floated into the room, long aqua hair flowing down her back in waves 
reminiscent of the stormy ocean.  Her dress was predominantly white, 
aquamarines forming waves around her neck and the skirt deepest sapphire 
hemmed in the same stones.  She knew the men were staring at her, but 
after her talk with Haruka, she didn&#39;t care in the least.  She also no 
longer cared what her mother thought about her love life, so she merely 
sat down and glanced at the women around her.  She decided that none of 
them were as beautiful as Haruka, so she looked up and waited.  &quot;You 
all, of course, know a favorite return guest of Tohoku, the stunning 
future duchess of Kanto Region, Kaiou Michiru.  Please feel free to 
welcome her as you always have.&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin cleared his throat as the next woman entered, dressed in an 
emerald gown and looking distinctly uncomfortable being the center of 
attention.  &quot;This beautiful brunette is Kino Makoto, daughter of Kino 
Meisha and Meika, Duke and Duchess of Chubu Region, orphaned at a very 
young age, only recently returned to the truth of her upbringing.  
Please extend your support and love to our new friend and let her see 
that no matter what she endured these past fifteen years, we are here 
for her.&quot;  Cheers joined the shocked gasps, and Makoto groaned inwardly 
as she realized what trouble this was going to cause when they reached 
Chubu.  She sat in the chair across from the duchess of Kanto, leaving 
the seat at the head of the table beside Michiru free for the duchess of 
Tohoku.  Aomori Ken&#39;nin bowed deeply to the crowd, glancing at his 
family sitting beside Makoto and across from Rei.  He pointed at the 
throne-like chair between Michiru and Makoto that had been empty since 
Kazeko and Koshu died so many years before.  &quot;And now I take my seat.  I 
announce here and now that I will relinquish my title of Regent and take 
back my less powerful throne of Lord Aomori.  I would like for you to 
meet my successor, a woman I know you will all recognize.&quot;
 
Haruka walked into the room, grace she had only just learned blending 
with the nobility she had been born with.  Her sparkling golden dress 
showed off every curve of her body, making her look incredibly feminine 
despite her short hair.  Her emerald eyes searched the room warily, 
calming when they came to rest on Michiru.  On her brow sat the crown 
even Ken&#39;nin had never dared to don, the gem-studded Crown of Tohoku.  
The golden band marked the tall woman as a daughter of the Ten&#39;ou Line, 
but none of the guests noticed that.  They took in the dark gold hair, 
the vibrant eyes, the bearing, and they all hit one knee.  They knew 
this woman as the daughter of their former Duchess.  &quot;My name is Ten&#39;ou 
Haruka, sole daughter and heir of Ten&#39;ou Koshu and Ten&#39;ou Kazeko.  I am 
the born Duchess of Tohoku Region.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka-sama!&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t do that.  I&#39;ve been an orphan in Kanto my whole life and I&#39;m 
not ready for this.  I just wanted to say that I&#39;m honored and all, but 
I&#39;m not ready to take my place as Duchess.&quot;  A sound of despair passed 
through the room, and Haruka raised her hand.  &quot;Your support is 
encouraging.  I will return one day, but for now I wish to ask Aomori 
Ken&#39;nin to resume his position as Regent, a position he has done justice 
to.  My cousin, will you accept?&quot;
 
The people of Tohoku already knew that the arrangements had been made 
for the transfer of power, but they waited for Aomori&#39;s ceremonial 
response.  The tall man stood, his noble bearing silencing the mumbles 
in the room.  &quot;My second cousin on my mother&#39;s side, daughter of Kazeko, 
a friend though she was family, daughter of my best friend Koshu, I know 
why you ask this and I respect the position you are in.  I, as your 
second cousin and Lord of Aomori Prefecture, will be glad to hold your 
throne for you until you are ready to become our Duchess.  For tonight, 
my beloved cousin, please do us the honor of sitting enthroned with us.  
After the feast, we will return your crown to its place of honor, 
waiting eagerly for your return.&quot;
 
Haruka bowed her head and took her seat at the head of the table between 
Makoto and Michiru.  The crowd cheered as the servants brought the first 
course.  Haruka immediately turned to Michiru, her tension evident to 
the aqua-haired woman.  &quot;That was hard.  I&#39;ve never spoken in public 
before.&quot;
 
&quot;Never, Haruka-san?&quot;
 
The blonde shook her head.  &quot;You don&#39;t speak in the Tokyo Fighting 
Arena.  You don&#39;t speak to Kurai if you value your dinner.&quot;
 
&quot;But you do if you value your friends.&quot;  Haruka raised her eyebrow, and 
Michiru smiled.  &quot;Makoto-san told me why she was tied to that post so 
many days ago.  You stood up for her, and I imagine I could never have 
exhibited such courage.  I admire you for that.&quot;
 
Haruka blushed as she bent to her soup.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka knocked on the door, praying for an answer.  A short servant 
girl, long burnt orange hair tied back, glanced at the visitor and bowed 
her head.  &quot;Highness.  Would you like to come in?&quot;
 
&quot;If Mako-chan will have me.&quot;
 
&quot;Let her in, Kae, and please leave until tomorrow morning.&quot;  Kae bowed 
and left as Haruka entered Makoto&#39;s room.  Makoto, still wearing her 
magnificent emerald dress, was standing at the huge window, staring at 
the star-sparkled sky.  &quot;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d come.&quot;
 
&quot;Mako-chan, I need to talk to you.  Being here, being back home, has 
convinced me that I have a long way to go before I really know who I am.  
I know that I love you and that you are the only person who truly 
understands me, but even I know that there are many different kinds of 
love.  I think you&#39;re the sister I never had.&quot;
 
Makoto smiled as she turned around.  &quot;I know, Haru-chan.  I&#39;ve known for 
a while, I think.  Back in the arena, you protected me, but we never 
considered a future, and love requires a future.  When Setsuna-san 
touched me, I realized a great many things, and I was forced to 
reevaluate my feelings for you and the way I responded to your 
confusion.  I think there is someone else here for you, and I hope that 
there is someone here for me, too.  I want my sister back, Haru-chan.&quot;
 
Haruka cheered inside as she crossed the room and pulled Makoto back 
into her arms where she belonged.  &quot;Thank you for taking me back.  No 
matter what I say, I don&#39;t think I can live without you.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;ll never have to.  Haru-chan, Can you hold me while I fall asleep?  
Last night was horrible, and I know that I have to learn to sleep easily 
without you, but I can&#39;t yet.  Do you mind?&quot;
 
&quot;Never.  Let&#39;s go to bed, Mako-chan.&quot;  Shifting her grip slightly, 
Haruka pulled Makoto to the large bed and stretched out, holding her 
adopted sister as she found a comfortable position and relaxed.  Arms 
wrapped securely around Makoto, Haruka found herself losing 
consciousness.  The exhausted duchesses fell asleep at the same time.
 
Michiru entered some time later, searching for both duchesses, not at 
all surprised to learn from Kae that Haruka had gone to visit Makoto.  
What she saw, though, did shock her.  Haruka and Makoto were lying in 
the single bed, curled up in each other&#39;s arms, utterly content to stay 
there forever.  The look of belonging on Haruka&#39;s face cut Michiru to 
the core, and she backed out of the room as quickly as she could.  She 
fled to her own suite, closing the door and falling onto the bed, 
sobbing silently.  She never thought that Haruka choosing Makoto would 
upset her, but she had never felt so betrayed in all of her life.  She 
didn&#39;t know if what she felt for the former fighter was love, 
admiration, or just lust, but it was more than friendship and she wanted 
more than that from the tall blonde.  &quot;I thought we understood each 
other,&quot; she whispered to herself and to the uncaring walls of her room.  
&quot;I thought you said that she was like a sister to you.  Then how could 
you choose her over me?  Do I mean nothing to you?&quot;  For the first time 
in her life, Michiru cried herself to sleep.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka groaned as she woke, her first thought of the Fighting Palace.  
When she opened her eyes to find herself in a huge palatial suite, she 
remembered that she was in Tohoku, the Region her family had ruled since 
the gods laid down the family lines of Japan so long ago.  Smiling, she 
shook Makoto gently.  &quot;Mako-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;Haru-chan?  I thought you left.&quot;
 
&quot;I was going to, but I think I fell asleep before you.&quot;  Haruka slipped 
out of bed and grimaced at the golden dress she still wore.  &quot;I should 
have changed out of this for sure.  I&#39;ll return to my room and find 
something to wear.&quot;
 
&quot;No, Haru-chan; I know you&#39;ll pick pants.  Let me call Kae and get her 
to bring an appropriate dress.&quot;
 
&quot;Please, no, Mako-chan!  I hate dresses.&quot;
 
&quot;I know.&quot;
 
Haruka sighed as she sat down on the edge of the bed.  &quot;Fine.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Michiru avoided Haruka as they boarded the ship again.  The blonde found 
her friend standing on the upper deck, staring into the sea, tears in 
her beautiful sapphire eyes.  &quot;Michiru-san?&quot;
 
Michiru jumped at the sound, turning away once she had identified the 
intruder.  &quot;Go away, Haruka-san.  Go be with Makoto-san.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re in pain, and I don&#39;t know why.  Tell me what&#39;s wrong.  At the 
farewell you even refused to stand by my side where you should have been 
as a guest of the court.&quot;
 
&quot;There, you see?  One taste of power, and you know all of the rules.  I 
knew you were a duchess all along.  Wasn&#39;t it nice to be home again?&quot;
 
Haruka nodded, worry in her emerald eyes.  &quot;But this freedom is nice, 
too.  It&#39;s nice being able to do what you want when you want.&quot;
 
&quot;I can&#39;t do what I want, Haruka-san.  I&#39;m the future duchess, and my 
life is very important to my people and the queen.  Every instant of my 
life has been planned and mapped out, including the man I&#39;m supposed to 
marry.&quot;
 
&quot;Marry?&quot;  Haruka straightened up from the balcony, turning to look at 
the aqua-haired beauty.  &quot;You&#39;re engaged?  You never told me.&quot;
 
Michiru&#39;s voice was choked with tears as she answered.  &quot;Because I&#39;m not 
engaged.  But I was promised to the Lord of Ibaraki-ken&#39;s son the day I 
was born female.  The thrones may pass to the daughter, but it is her 
husband who will rule, and my parents wanted Kenjo.  So we are engaged, 
and I have to marry him after my Seijinshiki.&quot;
 
&quot;And you don&#39;t want to.&quot;
 
&quot;Never,&quot; Michiru hissed.  &quot;I don&#39;t like his brazenness, his pomposity, 
his inflated ego, his assumption that he is the center of the Universe . 
. . and I . . .&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t even like men,&quot; Michiru whispered in the tiniest voice she 
could manage.  &quot;I&#39;m a lesbian, Haruka, but that isn&#39;t acceptable at our 
level.  We have to marry men to have the heirs to continue our kingdom, 
and I don&#39;t think I can ever let him touch me.  My parents would be so 
ashamed if they found out.&quot;
 
&quot;Not if they love you,&quot; Haruka whispered soothingly.  &quot;There is nothing 
wrong with being attracted to women.  I think women are very beautiful, 
and I&#39;m a duchess.  As I told you before, Rei and Minako are lovers, and 
Setsuna doesn&#39;t seem to care one way or the other.  As the Duchess of 
Tohoku, I will oppose your marriage to the son of the Lord of Ibaraki.&quot;
 
Michiru smiled as she looked up into Haruka&#39;s emerald eyes, forgetting 
her former animosity toward the tall blonde.  &quot;Thank you.  I think a 
better idea would be for me to marry somebody else first.&quot;
 
&quot;Another woman?  Is that possible?  Is that legal?&quot;
 
&quot;It is, though it is highly discouraged in the upper classes.  I would 
rather marry somebody I love than somebody my mother chose to seal 
alliances.  I wish I were more like you.&quot;
 
&quot;Me?  Why?&quot;
 
&quot;Because you&#39;re not afraid of anything.  You are so free, and you defy 
anyone to change you.  I&#39;m not that strong.&quot;
 
Haruka rested her arm on Michiru&#39;s shoulder as both turned to watch the 
sea speed past.  &quot;You have your own kind of strength, Michiru-san, and I 
respect you for that.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you.&quot;</pre>
