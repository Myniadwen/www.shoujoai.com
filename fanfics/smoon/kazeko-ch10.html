<h1>Kazeko (part 10 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Usagi looked up from arranging her hair as a time portal appeared in the 
center of the room.  Setsuna and Serenity/Ailan stepped out of the 
portal, both dressed for the wedding, arms linked, and all activity in 
the room ceased.  Usagi smiled as she realized that the two women had 
come to peace with the time separating them.  &quot;I was wondering if you 
two were ever coming back, Mother.&quot;
 
Only Rei caught the expression of pain that crossed Setsuna&#39;s features 
as she realized that that word was never going to mean her, and Ailan 
squeezed her arm reassuringly before smiling at her daughter.  Minako 
giggled at the sudden reappearance of the queens.  &quot;What were you two 
doing that took so long?&quot;  The women blushed, and Minako laughed harder 
while Ami and Makoto exchanged a knowing look.  Hotaru jumped into her 
green-haired mother&#39;s arms, and Setsuna smiled.
 
&quot;You almost missed the wedding, Setsuna-mama!  It&#39;s today!&quot;  She looked 
at Ailan and raised an eyebrow, remembering more about their doomed love 
from the Silver Millennium than any of the older senshi.  &quot;You don&#39;t 
want to miss Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama&#39;s wedding this time.  Why 
don&#39;t you take one of the empty seats in the family row?&quot;
 
Ailan bowed.  &quot;Thank-you, Hotaru-chan.  As always, so kind.&quot;  She 
slipped out of the room and Rei followed a second behind, offering to 
lead the silver haired woman to her seat.
 
Ailan stopped just outside the shrine, out of earshot of the senshi and 
the guests, and crossed her arms over her chest.  &quot;I don&#39;t believe that 
excuse.  Why did you really want to talk to me?&quot;
 
Rei sighed and pushed her long black hair over her shoulder.  
&quot;Ailan-san, I know all about you and Setsuna-san in the Silver 
Millennium.  I know that she was Usagi&#39;s father, the Moon King, and that 
she left to insure that her daughter would have a future and her claim 
to the throne would not be threatened.&quot;
 
Ailan stared at the Princess of Mars, seeing Rikuriko&#39;s strength in 
those purple eyes.  &quot;Back then you would never have figured it out.  I 
had enough power back then to block even the sight of the Aqua Mirror.  
But now I have no power and your power of premonition can break through.  
I want to tell her, Rei-chan, she deserves to know, but Setsu doesn&#39;t 
want that.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, she wants it, but she won&#39;t endanger her daughter like that.  
Ailan-san, you don&#39;t have to worry about anyone else discovering your 
secret; they don&#39;t remember their previous lives.  If Haruka-san and 
Michiru-san did, they would have figured it out by now.  So, until 
Setsuna-san returns our memories&#151;and I&#39;m not even sure I want that 
burden&#151;you have nothing to fear.  Now, the seat there beside the Tsukino 
family is free. Those are Usagi&#39;s parents in this life, and you should 
meet them.  They don&#39;t know anything about Usagi&#39;s soul mother&#151;just tell 
them that you&#39;re the designer for this wedding and Setsuna&#39;s 
girlfriend.&quot;  With that warning, Rei returned to the dressing room.
 
Ailan took her seat, wondering why Setsuna had chosen not to let the 
senshi remember their previous lives, and why was Rei so determined to 
keep it that way?
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Setsuna followed Hotaru to the room where Michiru was preparing for her 
wedding.  She had opted for an outdoors ceremony so her beloved could 
feel the wind around her.  Though Haruka would never have asked for such 
a consideration, she was grateful.  Only Michiru understood that the 
blonde was more nervous than her bride; the senshi of Uranus would need 
the comfort of the wind if she was to keep from breaking down during the 
ceremony.
 
&quot;Michiru-mama?&quot;
 
&quot;Hai?&quot;
 
&quot;Setsuna-mama is here.&quot;
 
&quot;Come in, Setsuna-san!&quot;
 
Setsuna entered Michiru&#39;s dressing room, smiling when Hotaru settled 
down to wait outside.  Michiru, her aqua and white dress whispering 
against the floor, embraced Setsuna.  &quot;Where have you been?  We were 
afraid you wouldn&#39;t be back in time!&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ve been at the Gates of Time, working out my problems with Ailan.&quot;
 
&quot;And?&quot;
 
Setsuna sighed as she walked away from the woman who had become like a 
beloved daughter to her, a partner in the difficult life of the senshi.  
&quot;She&#39;ll stay for a little while, but she doesn&#39;t want to stay in my 
life.  She&#39;s not a queen anymore, and she&#39;s not a senshi, protected by 
the soul of a planet.  She&#39;s mortal and she&#39;ll die before Crystal Tokyo 
is ever formed.  And I&#39;ll be alone again.  She&#39;s afraid that if she 
stays too long I&#39;ll let my shields down, let her in again, and I won&#39;t 
be able to survive her death a second time.  It&#39;s not fair, Michiru-san.  
Your lover, your soulmate, is an immortal senshi, same as you.  But mine 
had the bad luck to love her daughter so much that she gave up the only 
crystal that could keep her alive.  Ailan is doomed to live and die the 
mortal life she spared her daughter.&quot;
 
Michiru laid her head on Setsuna&#39;s shoulder, tears in her eyes.  &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Setsuna.  You know that we all love you like our mother, 
especially Usagi.  We&#39;ll take care of you, I promise.&quot;
 
Setsuna wiped the tears out of her eyes and smiled at the bride.  &quot;I&#39;m 
going to make you late for your wedding!&quot;
 
&quot;Setsu-chan . . .&quot;
 
The Senshi of Time flinched.  &quot;Please don&#39;t call me that,&quot; she 
whispered.  &quot;She calls me that, and all of the old queens called me 
that.  Everyone I loved and lost used that name, and I just can&#39;t . . .&quot;
 
&quot;I understand, my friend.  Let me get my veil.&quot;  Michiru&#39;s silver veil 
was ringed by aqua-colored flowers and had a dark sapphire bow in the 
back, reminiscent of her sailor fuku.  In the front was a slender golden 
tiara with an aquamarine in the center, sparkling in the light.  Her 
long white gloves ended in aqua rings, and her silver shoes were studded 
with aquamarines.
 
Setsuna stuck her head out the door and whispered something to Hotaru, 
watching as her adopted daughter dashed away.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka stood in the sun, letting the whisper of the winds calm her.  She 
would never admit it to anyone, especially her beloved, but she was 
scared to death.  She knew that something would go wrong; she wasn&#39;t 
meant to be happy.  If Setsuna didn&#39;t come back soon, the wedding would 
be short one father-of-the-bride.  In her mind, among other tiny 
snippets of her life in the Silver Millennium that sometimes leaked 
through Setsuna&#39;s block, Haruka could see the final dance, Queen 
Serenity safe in Setsuna&#39;s arms.  Those two loved each other 
desperately, and they certainly deserved to be together, but Haruka 
didn&#39;t want their lover&#39;s spat to ruin Michiru&#39;s perfect wedding.
 
&quot;Haruka-papa!&quot;
 
Haruka turned to face Hotaru, smiling slightly.  &quot;Yes, Hime-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;Setsuna-mama&#39;s back and Michiru-mama&#39;s almost ready!&quot;
 
&quot;Finally,&quot; Haruka smiled.  &quot;Go tell the girls to come out here so we can 
start.&quot;  As Hotaru dashed away and Haruka walked to the front of the 
shrine, she noticed a familiar silver-haired woman in the front row with 
the senshi&#39;s families, talking and laughing with Tsukino Ikuko.  She 
smiled as the two mothers of the Moon Princess conversed excitedly.  
Ailan was gorgeous!  Setsuna sure had elegant and refined tastes.
 
Usagi exited the shrine, Rei, Minako, Ami, and Makoto behind her, all 
seemingly floating down the aisle between the rows of seats.  Haruka 
sensed Mamoru stiffen behind her, and she groaned silently.  That prince 
needed to learn to control his reactions.  You would think he was the 
one getting married!  Rei&#39;s grandfather in the front row stared at the 
women as they passed, and Rei bopped him on the head as she passed.  
&quot;Grandpa,&quot; she hissed in warning.  The priest behind Haruka watched, 
smiling, as the women took their places.  He was an old friend of 
Haruka&#39;s, and she wondered why that seemed so familiar.  An old priest 
friend performing her marriage to Michiru.  She let that thought fade as 
all eyes turned to the shrine.
 
Haruka could feel everyone lean forward as Michiru slowly descended the 
stairs on Setsuna&#39;s arm, a few steps behind the ring-bearer Shingo and 
the flower girl Hotaru&#151;who, though a teenager, still looked young and 
delicate.  Haruka could feel her eyes widen at her lover&#39;s beauty, and 
she knew that she had seen this before.  She and Michiru had been 
married in the Silver Millennium, but she just couldn&#39;t remember.  

&quot;Haruka?&quot;
 
Michiru&#39;s musical voice jolted Haruka out of her thoughts, and she 
smiled as the smaller woman took her hands in her own.  She could see 
her own excitement and worry in her lover&#39;s deep sapphire eyes, and she 
relaxed.  She took comfort in the fact that Michiru was not as calm as 
she seemed, and she could hear her partner&#39;s laugh in the back of her 
mind.
 
Haruka never could remember much of the ceremony.  Lost in Michiru&#39;s 
veiled blue eyes, she soared higher than ever before, higher than they 
had gone with their music, finding themselves on the surface of a 
scarred moon, a crooked blue-green planet in the sky.
 
&quot;Is that . . . Uranus?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, Haruka.  Look behind you.&quot;  Haruka turned around, which only 
required a thought as non-corporeal spirits, and she gasped at the 
formation jutting out of the sand.  She floated over them, touching the 
weather-scarred formations.
 
&quot;This was my castle,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I was born here.&quot;  She touched 
the point of what had once been a spire, floating lower and looking 
through a huge hole, careful of the shards of glass scattered 
everywhere.  &quot;This was my room,&quot; she realized.  &quot;I lived here for most 
of my life during the Silver Millennium.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s sad to see your castle reduced to rubble,&quot; Michiru whispered, 
touching the edge of the glass.  &quot;Why are we here?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know.  If I remembered more of our past, I would know why.&quot;
 
&quot;Setsuna doesn&#39;t want us to remember for a reason.&quot;  Michiru took 
Haruka&#39;s hand and smiled, pointing at a single unflickering point of 
light in the night sky.  &quot;That&#39;s Neptune; shall we go?&quot; 
 
They arrived on Neptune&#39;s moon moments later, easily finding the ruins 
of her castle by the side of an empty sea.  Tall, jagged rocks sat below 
the ruins, at the edge of what had once been a raging sea.  Michiru 
knelt by the dry, dark sand, and tears ran down her cheeks.  &quot;My sea is 
gone, Haruka.  My castle is in ruins, and all the people are dead.  I 
remember parties and swimming and picnics in green lawns, but all of 
that is gone now.&quot;  She floated up to the one room that was still 
intact, though now rested only a few feet above ground level, and she 
sighed.  &quot;My room.&quot;
 
Haruka touched the wall beside the shattered window, and she gasped as 
desire flooded her.  She sensed Michiru respond to the feelings, and she 
pulled away.  &quot;Our first night together,&quot; she gasped.  &quot;We spent our 
first night together in this room, Michiru.&quot;
 
&quot;I know, love.  We should return to the earth and our wedding.&quot;  Michiru 
pulled Haruka into her arms, smiling as she felt the blonde&#39;s love fill 
her, and they returned to Earth as easily as they left.
 
Mere seconds had passed.  The priest was actually still on the same 
word.  Haruka glanced at Setsuna without actually moving her head, and 
her eyes widened when she noticed that Setsuna&#39;s red eyes were glowing 
slightly.  The Senshi of Time and Space nodded slightly, and Haruka 
returned her attention to her bride.  She never remembered much of the 
ceremony, leaving her body on autopilot, repeating after the priest when 
she was supposed to, answering his questions when expected.  When it 
came to exchange the rings, Haruka took the slim golden band studded 
with tiny aquamarines she had chosen for her lover onto Michiru&#39;s 
delicate finger, thankful that those white gloves were skintight.  She 
briefly wondered if they were from Neptune&#39;s fuku.
 
When Michiru slipped the simple golden band onto Haruka&#39;s long finger, 
the blonde felt power fill her as the wind began to gust faster, 
surprising the guests.  The senshi didn&#39;t even blink.  She could see in 
Michiru&#39;s sapphire eyes that her lover could feel the wild energy, and 
she shivered, just noticeably.  Something was going to happen.
 
The feeling faded when the priest pronounced them married and paused for 
dramatic effect.  &quot;You may kiss the bride.&quot;
 
Haruka never heard the priest&#39;s words.  In her mind, Michiru&#39;s laughter 
sounded at her frozen state.  &quot;I think I love you,&quot; Michiru purred in 
her mind.  &quot;Kiss me you fool, and make it snappy!&quot;
 
Haruka was ready and willing to obey.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Michiru felt power surge through her body as Haruka&#39;s lips touched hers.  
She could hear the sea crash against the shore, reaching for the winds 
that swirled around the pair.  The wind began to sing as the lovers 
kissed, and the senshi smiled.  They knew.  Usagi glanced past the 
kissing pair at Mamoru, smiling in anticipation of their coming wedding.  
Her boyfriend smiled back, blue eyes sparkling, wondering if his wedding 
with the Moon Princess would be so beautiful and so perfect.
 
Setsuna reached over and took Ailan&#39;s hand, knowing that old queen could 
feel the powers of Uranus and Neptune combining.  They both remembered 
the night Princess Uranus and Princess Neptune took their stones and 
combined their powers.  Setsuna placed her free hand on her flat belly 
and remembered carrying the tiny babe Helios.  Haruka and Michiru&#39;s 
child.  They didn&#39;t even remember conceiving him.
 
Setsuna squeezed Ailan&#39;s hand without realizing it as she watched the 
destined lovers kiss, an obvious display of affection they would not 
have permitted a few years earlier.  They didn&#39;t remember conceiving 
their son, they didn&#39;t remember any of the Silver Millennium.  Was that 
right?  Didn&#39;t they&#151;didn&#39;t all of the senshi&#151;deserve to remember their 
past lives, their past loves?  Despite what Rei said, even the Senshi of 
Fire wanted to know.  Her brave front was just to protect her form the 
reality that she would probably never remember her lover or her royal 
family.  Did Setsuna have the right to deny the younger senshi that joy?
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka pulled away from Michiru, her arms wrapped around the smaller 
woman.  They were married.  For better or worse, until death and beyond, 
they were one.  She could see her joy mirrored in Michiru&#39;s sapphire 
eyes, and Haruka felt a sudden sharp pang of trepidation and . . . 
anticipation.  She looked over Michiru&#39;s shoulder at Setsuna, and she 
could see in those garnet eyes that the Senshi of Time knew what she was 
thinking.  Haruka got the feeling that she and Michiru had married in 
the Silver Millennium over Setsuna&#39;s objections.  Michiru, sensing the 
path her wife&#39;s thoughts were taking, glanced over her shoulder at the 
father-of-the-bride and frowned slightly.  Before they could say 
anything, a cheer sounded and the married couple was surrounded.  A talk 
could wait.  Haruka cried out in annoyance as she and her wife were 
lifted onto willing shoulders and paraded around the yard.  Michiru 
laughed at the excitement of their friends and family.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka and Michiru were in the center of the crowd of dancing couples.  
They stared into each other&#39;s eyes, utterly content for the first time 
in their lives.  Michiru laid her head on Haruka&#39;s breast and sighed.  
&quot;Aishiteru, Uranus, King of the Winds.&quot;
 
&quot;Aishiteru, Neptune, Queen of the Seas,&quot; Haruka whispered back.  &quot;I 
think maybe this time we can be together forever.&quot;
 
&quot;Honto?  Shinjiteru no?&quot;
 
&quot;Hai, Michiru, shinjiteru.&quot;
 
Mamoru twirled Usagi across the dance floor, as always amazed by his 
partner&#39;s new mature grace.  &quot;You dance well, Usako.&quot;
 
Usagi blushed.  &quot;It&#39;s all in the partner, Mamo-chan.&quot;  She turned her 
head to look at the couple in the center of the dance floor, waiting for 
her boyfriend to follow her gaze.  &quot;Do you think we&#39;ll be that happy, 
Mamo-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;I promise we will.&quot;
 
Ailan watched her daughter in the arms of the former prince of Earth and 
she smiled.  &quot;They&#39;re so beautiful together, Setsu-chan.&quot; 

&quot;Who now?&quot;  Pluto smiled as she followed her lover&#39;s gaze.
 
&quot;All of them.  Serenity and Endymion.  Haruka and Michiru.  They belong 
together, though I couldn&#39;t see it when I was Queen of the Moon.  This 
reminds me of the last dance, except . . .&quot;
 
Setsuna pointed at a table two down from theirs where Hotaru and Shingo 
had gone to laugh about something with the Inner Senshi.  Makoto looked 
at Ami and whispered something to Mercury.  The blue-haired girl blushed 
and nodded, following the brunette onto the dance floor.  &quot;You must have 
faith, Ailan.  Their love is still there, just a little hidden.  It will 
come back, and they will be happy again.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Makoto listened to Hotaru talk about the wedding, a smile on her face, 
green eyes distant.  It seemed that she had attended a wedding similar 
to this one, but it hadn&#39;t ended quite so well.  She looked at the 
couples on the dance floor and realized that she was no longer excluded 
from the festivities.  She turned to her girlfriend.
 
&quot;Ami,&quot; she whispered while the teens were busy with Minako and Rei.  The 
blue-haired girl turned, and Makoto almost lost herself in those 
sapphire eyes.  &quot;Ami, would you . . . would you dance with me?&quot;
 
Ami smiled, tears sparkling in her eyes.  &quot;Mochiron, Mako-chan.&quot;  She 
took Makoto&#39;s hand, her mind flying to a dance years earlier when she 
had been the one to ask and to lead the tall woman onto the floor.  A 
blush spread across her face as she stood and followed her girlfriend 
and partner onto the floor.
 
Shingo cleared his throat and stepped back from the table, bowing 
deeply.  &quot;Hotaru-chan, would you do me the honor of dancing with me?&quot;
 
Hotaru laughed as she took Shingo&#39;s hand.  &quot;Mochiron, Shingo-kun.&quot;  The 
two went out onto the dance floor, leaving Venus and Mars alone.
 
Minako looked away, her light blue eyes dark with tears.  She looked 
back, shocked, as Rei took her hand.  &quot;Minako-chan,&quot; Rei began timidly, 
&quot;I hate to see my best friend upset.  I&#39;m really not sure what&#39;s been 
going on between us since Haruka and Michiru&#39;s engagement, but I fear 
that I have hurt you, have lost our friendship.&quot;
 
&quot;Rei, no . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Then, as my friend, will you dance with me?&quot;
 
Minako blushed and tried to pull away, but the miko was far stronger 
than her and would have none of it.  She smiled as she pulled Minako 
onto the dance floor and into her arms.  Whatever was building the wall 
between them could wait until after the dance.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Setsuna caught Ailan&#39;s hand and pointed at Rei and Minako as they joined 
the couples on the floor.  &quot;It looks like everyone&#39;s dancing.  Even Rei 
and Minako, though they have had troubles recently.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;d hate to be the only ones left behind,&quot; Ailan whispered, pulling 
Setsuna to her feet.  &quot;Dance with me, my king?&quot;
 
Setsuna laughed, easily taking the lead.  &quot;I thought you would never 
ask.&quot;  Smiling, truly happy for the first time in centuries, the Queen 
of Pluto, the former King of the Moon, led the last Queen of the Moon 
and the Silver Millennium onto the dance floor.</pre>
