<h1>1000 Words (part 1 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A hand shot out from under the covers, knocking the ringing clock to the 
floor. Yet despite the impact, the &quot;marvel&quot; of modern machinery 
continued its attack on the sleeper&#39;s ears. The lump underneath the 
comforter moved and moaned.

A head of golden tresses popped out from the covers and sleep-filled 
eyes glared at the offending object ringing. With a mumbled curse, the 
woman rose, the sheets falling away to reveal her perfect and very much 
nude body. Her blue eyes searched the bed for another figure, but found 
none. Good, she left.

Without grabbing anything to cover herself, the leggy blonde glided out 
of the room and into the large bathroom down the hall. She pulled open 
the curtains of the large windows as the light streamed in.

Taking a deep breath, the woman calmed at the sight of the familiar 
landscape of the Hollywood Hills. Sweet California, the land of eternal 
sunshine and warm weather. The perfect place for a golden child like 
her.

With a grace few possessed in the morning, the woman walked to the 
marble tub in the middle of the room and turned on the hot water. Her 
golden mane fell in waves, touching the surface of the rapidly rising 
water.

Her blue eyes glossed over as she touched the silky tresses. It&#39;s been 
so long since she&#39;s cut her hair, aside from the occasional trim, much 
to Mei&#39;s annoyance. She hasn&#39;t cut it ever since she left...

&#39;Don&#39;t think about that, baka. The past is the past.&#39;

And there was a bath waiting for her. She slowly lowered herself into 
the tub, letting the water sooth her aching body and stop her thoughts.

&#39;Live in the moment, Minako. Live in the moment.&#39;

Cerulean eyes closed at the thought. The advice she had been given 
before she left. Left her home, her friends, her family... before she 
left her.

The blonde frowned and climbed out of the tub. Looks like peace was 
evading her today.

The phone rang just as she pulled a silk robe over her wet form. She 
walked into the living room, grabbing the phone and sitting down on the 
couch to find the TV on.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

The angry scream of her manager met the young woman&#39;s sensitive ears.

&quot;Babs, breathe. I can&#39;t understand a word you&#39;re saying.&quot;

An image of the blonde appeared on the TV. The surprised girl searched 
for her remote, turning up the volume when she found it on the floor.

&quot;In entertainment news today, singing sensation Minako Aino and 
Brazilian supermodel Catalina ended their two months relationship last 
night. The couple, one of the most popular and beautiful of the year, 
started dating after Catalina starred in the singer&#39;s video for &#39;I Wanna 
Love You Forever.&#39; The sexy model played the girlfriend of Minako Aino, 
who everyone knows is bisexual. The chemistry between the two was 
obvious the second they appeared onscreen together so it was no surprise 
when they publicly announced their relationship a week later. The 
breakup last night, however, did come as a bit of a shock.&quot;

The man besides the woman looked puzzled as he spoke.

&quot;Why is Catalina known as just &#39;Catalina&#39;?&quot;

The woman laughed and shook her head. &quot;She is the Cher or Madonna of 
modeling. She doesn&#39;t need a last name.&quot;

&quot;And I can see why. In other news-&quot;

The blonde growled and changed the channel. This time, it was footage of 
her breakup with her now ex-girlfriend.

&quot;You just had to breakup with her in a restaurant, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

The irritated voice reminded the singer that her manager was still on 
the phone. With a soft sigh, she stood and headed for the kitchen.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to breakup there. Actually, I didn&#39;t mean to breakup, 
period.&quot;

&quot;So what, you want her back?&quot;

Minako rolled her eyes and grabbed a carrot from the fridge. She was 
going to ignore the eagerness in Babs&#39; voice. She was, after all, her 
manager and it goes without saying that she wanted her with a big name 
like Catalina&#39;s.

&quot;No, Babs, I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t going anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Since when have you cared if a relationship went somewhere?&quot;

The singer growled softly. &quot;I have always cared.&quot;

&quot;Then start behaving like it. You go through more &#39;relationships&#39; a week 
than most do their entire lives.&quot;

&quot;Barbara, it&#39;s too early to start this discussion.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

Silence. Minako sighed and relented. An angry manager would get her 
nowhere.

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;So what?&quot;

&quot;You know what,&quot; the blonde snapped.

&quot;Fine, I figured you should lay low for a while. You know, get the 
public to crave you again.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll work. I need a break anyhow.&quot;

The young woman saw an image of Tokyo on the television screen. The 
entertainment news was covering the phenomenon that was Athena 
Management and Siren Agency, two firms that everyone, including foreign 
stars, was trying to sign with.

&quot;Good. I&#39;ll book a flight to-&quot;

&quot;Tokyo.&quot;

Minako could imagine the frown on her manager&#39;s face.

&quot;Tokyo? I was thinking Sandro Pe.&quot;

&quot;I want to go home, Barbara.&quot;

&quot;Home?&quot; the woman sounded truly puzzled. &quot;But you are home.&quot;

&quot;You know what I mean.&quot;

The woman on the other end sighed.

&quot;Fine. Tokyo it is.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Babs.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah. Just pack.&quot;

The singer looked down at the inside of her left wrist and at the tiny 
tattoo of a heart surrounded by white wings.

Did she know what she meant?

Minako plastered on a smile as she stepped out of the plane. Hundreds of 
flashes went off and the roar of the fans was deafening as she walked 
down the stairs.

Before her feet even touched the ground, arms and hands appeared from 
all directions, trying to touch her. The police and airport security 
pushed back the crowd of screaming teenagers and young adults. The 
blonde knew better than to reach out and touch the hands, but managed to 
sign a few autographs as she walked down the cleared path, despite the 
protest of her bodyguards.

After what seemed like hours, the singer was pushed into the waiting 
limo. Her redhead manager entered a second later, along with two members 
of her security. The door slammed shut and they pulled away.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Babs muttered. &quot;Why couldn&#39;t you have picked Sandro Pe?&quot;

Minako rolled her eyes and pulled off her sunglasses. They really 
weren&#39;t needed at three in the morning.

&quot;You were the one that turned this into a publicity trip.&quot;

The redhead ignored her client&#39;s annoyance and pulled her Palm Pilot 
from her bag.

&quot;You&#39;re here anyway, so you might as well. Besides, people have been 
saying you&#39;ve &#39;forgotten your roots&#39; for a while now.&quot;

The star felt a pang of guilt at the statement. It was true. She has 
forgotten her roots. She had never once returned to Japan since she left 
all those years ago, although her record sells in Japan rivaled that of 
the ones in the US.

Blue eyes watched the crowd of people screaming her name as the limo 
pulled away from the airstrip.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know so many people would show up,&quot; she murmured to herself.

&quot;Of course, they&#39;re crazy about you. You&#39;re one of their own.&quot;

Minako ignored the other woman&#39;s tone but not her words. One of their 
own. She would always be Japanese. Nothing will ever change that.

Minako tossed her bag onto the couch as she entered the large hotel 
room. The expensive furniture and over the top design didn&#39;t amaze her 
like they once did. She&#39;d seen too much to be impressed.

&quot;Not a bad place, is it?&quot;

The slender woman pulled open the curtains just in time to see the sun 
rise behind the skyline of Tokyo.

&quot;No, it isn&#39;t.&quot;

She closed her blue eyes and leaned against the cool glass, basking in 
the warmth of the sunrise, though she couldn&#39;t actually feel it.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot;

The star smiled. &quot;Yes, just a little tired.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Go get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot;

Barbara walked to the nearby kitchen and grabbed a bottle of water 
before turning her sights to her client.

&quot;Babs?&quot;

&quot;Hmm...?&quot;

&quot;Where are you staying?&quot;

&quot;Downstairs.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

&quot;Minako could feel the nervousness radiate off the other woman.

&quot;When and where is my first appearance?&quot;

Barbara sighed. She hated making Minako work, but this was important.

&quot;I was going to either Athena Management or Siren Agency to see which 
one we&#39;ll sign with. No one gets a gig here without one of them.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

&quot;But you should make an appearance at Luna Talk just to announce that 
you&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;All right. When is that?&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow morning. Eight sharp.&quot;

&quot;So I have to be up at...?&quot;

&quot;Five.&quot;

&quot;All right.&quot;

The red-haired woman stared at her client&#39;s back.

&quot;Should I stay?&quot;

Minako waved her hand dismissively. &quot;No, no. You go ahead. I&#39;ll be 
fine.&quot;

&quot;Call if you need anything.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

The singer heard the door close and let out a breath she didn&#39;t know 
she&#39;d been holding. Blue eyes gazed at the skyline and the colors of the 
sunrise.

&quot;I&#39;m back.&quot;

Minako yawned as she climbed out of bed, heading for the shower and 
completely ignoring the people in the living room.

Half an hour later, she reemerged in a robe, gulping down the coffee 
that Babs handed her. The scathing liquid burned her mouth and throat as 
it went down.

&quot;All right, outfit first. Jen?&quot;

A petite woman with spiky black hair pushed over two racks. Minako eyed 
the clothes, though her mind was on the short stylist. The name Jennifer 
or even Jen didn&#39;t fit her... and those short locks were so much softer 
than they looked. Not at all jelled.

Barbara snapped the blonde from her thoughts when she asked her client 
quite impatiently if she&#39;d wear the black tube top.

&quot;No,&quot; the singer responded with a yawn.

&quot;What? Why not? You went to another show in a tube top... blue right?&quot;

Minako giggled when Jen rolled her green eyes behind her agent. The 
stylist shot her a wink before pulling a white blouse off the rack.

&quot;How about this?&quot;

&quot;Since when has Minako covered up?&quot;

Barbara laughed at the pretty Asian girl that was currently glaring at 
the singer&#39;s wet hair.

&quot;No, I meant- argh. Minako, get up and take off your robe.&quot;

The singer matched Jen&#39;s smirk with her own as she stood and undid the 
belt of her white bathrobe. The material slipped off her shoulders, 
revealing her cleavage and tanned skin before it fell to the ground 
completely.

Barbara mumbled under her breath as the Asian hairstylist laughed. Jen 
walked over and handed Minako the blouse, who slipped on the top slowly. 
The star&#39;s stylist then proceeded to tie the bottom of the top in a knot 
under Minako&#39;s breasts and fixed it to cover them.

Minako stared unabashed into Jen&#39;s eyes, her own blue orbs twinkling 
when the short woman touched her more than necessary.

&quot;Oh, for god&#39;s sakes!&quot; Barbara exclaimed before storming out.

The three women left stared at the redhead as she made her exit. They 
then turned their gazes to each other before laughing.

&quot;I swear, we&#39;re running out of ways to get rid of her!&quot; Minako said 
between her giggles.

Jen simply chuckled and went to grab a pair of jeans for her employer.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; the hairstylist said as she reached for the hairdryer. 
&quot;As long as you two keep touching and flirting, Babs will always leave.&quot;

The singer laughed and put on the tight, faded jeans as she turned to 
the other Asian girl.

&quot;Mei, you just want to see us touch and flirt.&quot;

The hairstylist giggled as her client took off the jeans and slipped 
into a short jean skirt.

&quot;I may be straight, but any girl would be a little gay for you, Mina.&quot;

Jen smiled as the blonde singer spun around once.

&quot;You look to Southern.&quot;

&quot;I am coming back from America.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re half English and half Japanese,&quot; the spiky-haired girl retorted.

&quot;Does that mean I can&#39;t go Southern?&quot;

&quot;A British cowboy,&quot; Mei said with a goofy grin as she entered her dreamy 
mode.

Minako rolled her eyes and grabbed a plaited skirt off the rack.

&quot;Are you doing a Britney now? You look like a Catholic schoolgirl gone 
bad.&quot;

Jen sighed in frustration and glared at the critical Mei.

&quot;I thought she was going for an American look,&quot; the fashionista snapped.

&quot;American, not a stereotype of American,&quot; Mei replied as she dug through 
her bag for hair gel.

&quot;Do you want me to do your job?&quot; Jen snapped.

&quot;Enough! God, if I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d think you two were a married 
couple,&quot; Minako said with an exasperated sigh.

&quot;Me? Married to her?&quot; Jen asked incredulously. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be 
joking.&quot;

&quot;Fuck you,&quot; the annoyed hairstylist growled.

&quot;All right, you two!&quot;

The two turned to the singer, who had just put on a flowing blue skirt 
that reached her ankles. The two arguing women studied her before Jen 
nodded.

&quot;Good. A pair of straw sandals should go great with that.&quot;

Minako sat down as a handsome man slipped in, grinning widely.

&quot;How are my three favorite girls?&quot;

He was met with silence as Jen and Mei continued to glare at one 
another. He rolled his eyes and looked at his employer.

&quot;They have a fight again?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Minako replied as Mei started drying her hair.

&quot;Going for a natural look?&quot; The African American young man asked as he 
grabbed some foundation.

&quot;I had to pick something, Patrick, or else they would&#39;ve killed each 
other.&quot;

The blonde star felt her hairstylist tug on her hair and remembered why 
she liked to stay on Mei&#39;s good side.

&quot;I swear, you two are like sisters!&quot; The makeup artist laughed.

&quot;I&#39;d ask my parents to disown me if that were true,&quot; Jen said, coming 
back with a pair of straw sandals.

&quot;Good. I get the inheritance then,&quot; Mei replied dryly.

Patrick laughed again and shook his head.

&quot;Eye shadow?&quot;

&quot;No, we don&#39;t want Minako to look fake,&quot; Barbara said offhandedly as she 
walked in.

The three working on the blonde silenced as the manager began running 
through the list of questions Luna would most likely ask the blonde 
singer. The gorgeous half-Japanese girl just continued nodding. She&#39;d 
heard them hundreds of times before. There was nothing she hasn&#39;t been 
asked.

&quot;Wait, the interview will be in Japanese, right?&quot;

Jen snorted as quietly as she could. Mei and Patrick just smirked at the 
exasperated look on the stylist&#39;s face.

&quot;Course, Babs,&quot; the green-eyed woman said dryly. &quot;We are in Japan.&quot;

Barbara ignored the teasing and stared at Minako with a frown.

&quot;You do remember how to speak Japanese, right, Mina?&quot;

The blonde rolled her eyes. &quot;No shit, Babs, I&#39;m Japanese.&quot;

&quot;Yes, well, you haven&#39;t been here in six years.&quot;

The blonde shrugged and stood when Peter finished her makeup by applying 
some clear lip-gloss.

&quot;Some things you never forget.&quot;

Minako felt nervous. She has never been nervous before. But then again, 
it&#39;s never been a show in Japan. Her first appearance in her home 
country.

She heard Japanese spoken all around her and took a deep breath. She was 
Minako Aino. She was Japanese, no matter how long she&#39;s been away. And 
she could do this.

&quot;Aino Minako!&quot;

The blonde star plastered on a huge smile as she walked onto the stage. 
The fans went crazy, chanting her name and screaming. The red light on 
the top of the cameras told her they were on the air. The lights were 
blinding. She felt her nervousness fade and instincts take over.

The singer waved to the crowd and walked over to the smiling woman 
standing in front of the couch. She maintained her composure, though 
inside she was ready to breakdown. She bowed to the talk show host 
before the other woman asked her to sit.

The audience eventually quieted down as Luna smiled at the blonde.

&quot;So, Aino-san,&quot; the host said with a grin. &quot;It&#39;s great that you&#39;re back 
in Japan! You&#39;ve been gone for quite a while. Why so long?&quot;

The blonde knew Babs was freaking out right now since she can&#39;t 
understand Japanese. Well, less of a chance that she&#39;d be scolded if she 
messed up.

&quot;Well, Luna-san,&quot; Minako said, the sound of her own voice forming the 
Japanese a bit of a shock, &quot;I promised myself before I left that I&#39;d 
make it big in America before I returned. I didn&#39;t feel ready before 
now.&quot;

The fans went crazy again as Minako waved. Luna laughed.

&quot;Well, by the sound of it, you&#39;ve done pretty well here, too.&quot;

The singer smiled. &quot;I couldn&#39;t have done it without the help of the 
fans, especially those here.&quot;

The audience&#39;s scream was painful but the blonde was used to it by now.

&quot;Aino-san, let&#39;s get down to business. Your fifth album is due to drop 
in six months. What can you tell us about it?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the star began, her smile never wavering, &quot;the album actually 
includes a few of the songs I wrote before I left Japan. So, the fans 
will hear a definite influence from the music popular a couple of years 
ago.&quot;

&quot;Oh? And the rest?&quot;

&quot;Well, although I haven&#39;t been back for a few years, I&#39;ve been keeping 
up with the music and I must confess, my style has definitely been 
affected. This album will be a return to my roots, so to speak.&quot;

Minako realized too late that she had given the host the perfect 
opportunity and cursed herself.

&quot;Speaking of roots, Aino-san, there is a question many have been dying 
to ask. On your first CD, &#39;I&#39;ve Arrived,&#39; the song &#39;One of These Days&#39; 
speaks of someone letting her lover go. In the booklet, you said, and I 
quote, &#39;the song is based on my own experiences with someone that meant 
a lot to me.&#39;&quot;

The singer nodded, biting her cheek as dread filled her.

&quot;Yes, that is true. I wrote the song after someone I cared for very much 
left.&quot;

&quot;So, who is this someone?&quot;

Minako smiled and laughed one of those laughs that were intent on 
brushing off the question.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t say.&quot;

&quot;Too bad. But is it true that one of the reasons you left Japan was 
because a relationship didn&#39;t work out?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is.&quot;

&quot;Ah. I&#39;m sure the person wished he or she didn&#39;t leave now.&quot;

Minako only smiled, though she felt like doing anything but.

Barbara kept talking, though she knew her client wasn&#39;t listening. She 
didn&#39;t care, to be honest. How could Minako make such a crucial mistake? 
She practically fainted when Mei translated what the blonde had said.

She was more worried than anything. The question had never come up in 
the States since Minako&#39;s first album wasn&#39;t as carefully scrutinized as 
her later ones. Who knew that bitch Luna would dig that up?

&quot;Minako? Minako!&quot;

The blonde turned to her manager, blue eyes far off.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

Barbara sighed and took off her glasses. &quot;Have you heard a single word 
I&#39;ve said?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

The manager knew that look well, despite the fact that she&#39;s rarely seen 
it. It was the one where her client&#39;s lips would form that small, warm 
smile of hers, though her eyes would harden and darken to the point 
where they became almost like sapphires. So, the older woman let the 
subject drop.

&quot;Should I rent a studio for you here? Or do you want to wait until we go 
back to the States?&quot;

The blonde&#39;s eyes softened at the mention of her music.

&quot;Here. There&#39;s only six months left.&quot;

Barbara nodded while her client looked out the window.

Minako watched the streets go by inside the stretch limo. She was 
separated from this world and yet only a small part of it.

She had told her that once. She told Minako to ease off in her 
relentless pursuit for a career. The world&#39;s a much large place than any 
of them really knew, she had said. The blonde&#39;s own dreams and 
aspirations were only part of the sphere that was made up of everyone&#39;s 
hopes.

Her. There was always only her. Only she could make Minako feel special 
and yet remind her that she was only one person in the world full of 
billions at the same time. Only she could make the star feel like a 
child and a mature woman.

She was a contradiction all in herself.

And she came up for the first time since Minako became a star today. The 
singer didn&#39;t know whether to be angered or glad that the world never 
knew about someone who was at one point the center of the world for 
their idol.

Minako was almost a goddess to many, but the blonde had no religion. She 
had been her religion, she was all the singer had.

The blue eyes continued to watch the street as the car started to move 
after the light turned green. That&#39;s when she saw it.

&quot;Stop the car!&quot;

The driver barely had time to react when Minako threw open the door and 
jumped out. She ignored her manager&#39;s confused screams and the cars 
honking as she ran to the sidewalk.

She saw it. The long, black hair that shone deep purple like a raven&#39;s 
wing on a sunny day like today. It was just a flash but it was her hair. 
It was her hair.

There! Another flash of raven, going into that music store!

The blonde took off, her athletic background and concert regimens 
keeping her in the perfect shape for darting through the crowded streets 
of Tokyo. She threw apologizes half-heartedly over her shoulder at those 
she plowed into but she didn&#39;t care. She had to catch her.

Minako looked around the second she burst into the music store. Where 
was she?

&quot;Oh my god! IT&#39;S AINO MINAKO!&quot;

The scream of a young girl snapped the singer back into reality. She was 
in a music store, without sunglasses or a cap... shit.

Her security team arrived just as the fans started to mob her. Even as 
people tugged and pulled on her, she tried desperately to catch one more 
glance of those black locks.

&quot;Minako! We have to get you out of here!&quot;

The star barely registered Barbara&#39;s frantic voice and barely felt the 
fans touching her. As her bodyguards escorted her out, her blue eyes 
searched the store.

&#39;Let me see it just once more.&#39;

Barbara cursed as she slammed the door shut. Her client ignored her rage 
and walked over to the window, pulling open the curtains to stare at the 
city.

The redhead threw her purse onto the coffee table, barely sparing a 
prayer that her Palm Pilot would be okay. Her Palm Pilot wouldn&#39;t count 
for shit if Minako weren&#39;t.

The agent turned her gray eyes to the silent figure of her client. She 
usually wasn&#39;t quiet, not even after a close encounter like that one...

It was her. Minako was sure of it. She knew that hair. After all, she 
did spent much of her time running her fingers through the silky 
strands...

Maybe that&#39;s why she&#39;s never dated women with hair as long as that. Past 
the waist, rolling in black waves off her shoulder...

The blonde shook her head.

Maybe it wasn&#39;t her. She was in Japan and lots of girls had long black 
hair.

&#39;No, it was. I know it.&#39;

&quot;Minako, what the hell were you thinking?&quot;

The woman didn&#39;t turn, though her attention was on the pressing matter 
at hand, the pissed redhead.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t really thinking.&quot;

&quot;Obviously!&quot;

Silence settled over the room after the older woman&#39;s scream. Babs ran a 
hand through her hair.

&quot;That was stupid and dangerous! Very dangerous! You were almost hit by 
several cars and if the security team didn&#39;t get to you...&quot; Barbara 
shuddered at the thought.

&quot;Babs,&quot; Mina said as she turned, smiling. &quot;I&#39;m fine. See? Unharmed!&quot;

The manager sighed and closed her eyes. Something was so very off here. 
Coming to Tokyo was a bad idea.

But even she could see how much Minako had to return, to come back to 
her native land.

&quot;Fine. I have a meeting tomorrow with Siren Agency. So, you have the 
rest of the day and tomorrow off.&quot;

&quot;Sirens? What about Athena?&quot;

&quot;Athena is geared more towards actors. Sirens, as the name suggests, it 
more focused on musicians.&quot;

Minako nodded before she turned to look out the window once again.

&quot;Babs?&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

&quot;Can I go out tomorrow?&quot;

The redhead frowned. And have a repeat of today? No way in hell!

&quot;I want to visit my old haunts.&quot;

Argh. How would she deny Minako that? Damn her.

&quot;I don&#39;t like it, but if you want. Bring George and Brad with you, at 
least.&quot;

Minako smiled. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;So, George, where does Mina wanna go today?&quot;

The man reading the paper looked at the impatient looking man playing 
with the chain hanging from his belt.

&quot;No idea. She wanted to go out was all Babs said.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Brad as he sat back. Knowing Mina, she wouldn&#39;t be up for another 
three or four hours.

Just then, both men saw a blonde blur shoot out of the bedroom and into 
the bathroom. Instead of the usual sounds of their client drawing a 
bath, they heard the shower running. Brad looked over at his equally 
surprised partner. One of the rules was that Minako didn&#39;t move very 
quickly before ten in the morning. This was weird.

&quot;Well,&quot; George said as he folded his paper. &quot;We&#39;re in for a strange 
day.&quot;

Minako walked into the Crown Arcade, looking around to find that nothing 
has changed. Just like most places she&#39;s been to.

She had gone to her old high school first. She saw the tree under which 
she, Ami, Makoto and Usagi used to eat lunch. She saw the gym, where she 
spent many hours practicing as the captain of the volleyball team. The 
principal was still the same man, kind but strict. He welcomed her back 
warmly, treating her as if she were just another graduate returning to 
the school for a visit...

- Flashback-

Minako walked the halls at a comfortable pace next to the middle-aged 
man. The students were all outside, enjoying the nice, spring weather. 
And that meant she wasn&#39;t going to be mobbed.

The pair entered one of the empty classrooms and the blonde felt a pang 
of nostalgia hit her. She walked over to a desk in the back and sat 
down.

It was strange, being here again. She was no longer the hopeful teenager 
she used to be. She was 23-years-old and her dream had come true.

Her fingers caressed the smooth top of the desk, then the side, then the 
bottom...

Her hand stopped when she felt an indentation in the surface. Her eyes 
widened with surprise as she went on her knees and crawled under the 
small table. She looked up and gasped.

-Flashback-

A younger Minako giggled as she ran into the classroom. Everyone was 
out, so it was the perfect time to-

&quot;Mina, wait up.&quot;

The blonde shook her head, fighting back a giggle at the annoyed voice. 
She felt a soft hand grab her wrist and pull her against the person she 
tried to run from. Before she could protest, a pair of soft lips 
descended upon hers, banishing all other thoughts save the kiss.

Both of them were breathless when they parted. Minako grinned.

&quot;I want to tell everyone I love you.&quot;

&quot;Mina, that&#39;s not possible.&quot;

&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll carve it into a desk.&quot;

The teenager stepped away and grabbed a pen before heading to her desk.

&quot;Mina, that&#39;s vandalism. You can get suspended.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll just carve it someone no one can see.&quot;

&quot;Mina...&quot;

&quot;Oh, hush you.&quot;

&quot;What if someone comes back?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be done before anyone comes.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Oh, come on.&quot;

A soft sigh.

&quot;Fine.&quot;

-End Flashback-

The singer bit her bottom lip as she stared at the carving. It was a 
small heart with the initials M and-

&quot;Minako? Barbara called,&quot; Brad said from the doorway.

Blue eyes blinked, clearing the memories before the star climbed out 
from under the desk.

-End Flashback-

George guided his client to a booth and sat down across from her, making 
room for Brad on his side. A waitress walked over and asked for their 
orders.

&quot;Burger, fries and a Coke,&quot; Brad ordered.

&quot;Same,&quot; George said as he muffled a yawn.

&quot;Chocolate milkshake, onion rings, fries, bacon cheeseburger and chicken 
nuggets.&quot;

The waitress nodded, though she gave the blonde a weird look, and walked 
away.

&quot;What are you,&quot; George teased, &quot;a bottomless pit?&quot;

Minako closed her eyes and smiled softly.

-Flashback-

Minako made a face when a blonde with pigtails stuffed two more cookies 
into her mouth. A look around the room told her everyone else was 
disgusted as well.

&quot;Usagi, it&#39;s a wonder you&#39;re not a balloon, you bottomless pit.&quot;

Eager blue eyes turned to the girl standing at the door, a cocky smirk 
on those kissable lips and a devious twinkle in her eyes.

&quot;You&#39;re such a meanie!&quot; Usagi whined.

Everyone just laughed as the teenager walked into the room, taking her 
normal seat across from Minako. The blonde felt annoyance and 
disappointment stir in her as usual, but it disappeared when her 
girlfriend sent her a small but genuine smile and a wink.

She had a goofy grin on her face for the rest of the day.

-End Flashback-

The food arrived and Minako, in true Usagi manner, wolfed it down at 
lightning speed. Brad and George ignored their client&#39;s appetite, used 
to seeing the slender woman eat so much.

The singer finished and looked around the Crown Arcade once again. There 
were the racing games where a tall, handsome blonde had creamed her. A 
new group of girls were giggling and laughing in their old booth.

Were they discussing what they talked about? Perhaps. Maybe some of what 
they talked about was too strange at times, but boys, clothes and 
graduating are topics that transcend time.

The three left the arcade after finishing their food and walked down the 
block. George and Brad paused when their employer stopped, staring at 
the movie theater across the street. Without a word, the star crossed 
the street, causing the two bodyguards to scramble after her.

Minako stared at the movie theater, eyes half closed. This was where 
they had their first date...

-Flashback-

A wheezing teenager ran through the streets, trying to avoid the people, 
who glared at her as she sped past. Oh god, oh god! She was late! Half 
an hour late! If it were any one else, she wouldn&#39;t give a fuck. But 
this wasn&#39;t anyone else! This was her.

Minako slid to a stop when the traffic light turned green. She was just 
one block away. Oh, please still be there. She looked down at her watch. 
Thirty-five minutes late.

She looked up at the traffic light just as it turned yellow. Without 
thinking, she ran into the street, causing several cars to screech to a 
stop then honk at her. She didn&#39;t care.

The blonde saw her standing there, arms crossed and looking so pretty in 
a pair of jeans and a blouse. She put on the breaks, only to slide past 
her date. Minako scrambled to get back, stopping in front of the girl 
and bowing repeatedly.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, please forgive me! I was in the shower for longer than I 
planned and then my hairdryer broke and I tried to find my mom&#39;s but I 
didn&#39;t know where she kept it so I went over to Usa&#39;s to use hers and 
then I realized I left my purse at home and-&quot;

The blonde stopped when a slender hand reached over and removed a leaf 
from her golden mane. Minako blinked as she stared at her date, afraid 
that she really was that angry.

&quot;Your hair&#39;s a mess,&quot; she said softly.

Minako blushed. &quot;I ran all the way here.&quot;

&quot;You must be thirsty. Let&#39;s go to the Crown. The movie started a while 
ago.&quot;

&quot;I really am sorry-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine, Mina. I&#39;m just happy nothing happened to you. I was getting 
paranoid.&quot;

The blonde blushed again before grinning at the faint coloring on her 
date&#39;s face. She wrapped her arms around the other girl&#39;s arm, resting 
her head against the slim shoulders as they headed for the Crown.

-End Flashback-

The star shook her head as she smiled. So, their first date hadn&#39;t gone 
as planned. They did have fun though.

Brad opened the car door for his employer before getting into the 
passenger side up front. George pulled the car away from the curb and 
headed back to the hotel.

Minako stared out the window. There was the bus stop where she asked her 
out. And the ice cream stand they always went to. The park where the 
whole group spent many happy afternoons and where she would watch the 
sunset with her...

She couldn&#39;t. She couldn&#39;t go back to the hotel without going to one 
more place.

George was surprised when the singer told him to turn back. What the 
hell?

Minako walked up the steps, the memories coming back to her with a 
vengeance. How well she knew these steps and those trees and that 
sign...

She had told her bodyguards to wait in the car, much to their annoyance. 
But she had to do this alone.

Her feet carried her to a worn side path, the still closed sakura 
blossoms on either side. The gentle breeze ruffled her hair and pulled 
on her cargo pants. The smell of the grass and blooming flowers 
surrounded her. Not unlike her smell.

The blonde bit her lip. This was stupid. She couldn&#39;t even think her 
name, much less say it. She always just thought of her, too afraid to 
remember her name or let it roll off her tongue.

She didn&#39;t deserve that. She deserved so much more. More than to be 
forgotten by the star, by the girl that swore she would love her 
forever.

The pink lips parted, suddenly dry. The singer inhaled, the name n the 
tip of her tongue.

&quot;Well, look at what the spring brought back.&quot;

Cerulean eyes widened as shock froze her in place. No, it wasn&#39;t 
possible. It... couldn&#39;t be her

But it had to be. That easy drawl, the confidence... the melodious sound 
that sent shivers down her spine...

Minako turned slowly, dread and anticipation replacing the shock. Her 
stomach dropped to her feet when she set her eyes on the woman standing 
behind her.

She couldn&#39;t think, couldn&#39;t breathe and most definitely couldn&#39;t 
believe whom she saw.

So she did what she was going to do before she had showed up. She 
whispered her name.

&quot;Rei.&quot;


Okay, that might have been a tad over the top. Just a tad, I hope.

I know it&#39;s not an update of Fallen or Gravity, but I really liked the 
sound of this fic and I had to post it. It&#39;ll be relatively short, I 
hope.

So, it&#39;s a Rei/Minako, as I said in the summary and as is obvious from 
the first chapter. Their past and everything will be explained in time, 
don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll make it as clear as I can.

Minako as a star, I know, I know, so stereotypical. But whatever, I can 
be a little unoriginal right?

This chapter is long. Much longer than the later chapters will be, but I 
couldn&#39;t find a place where I wanted to end it, so I decided to just 
keep going.</pre>
