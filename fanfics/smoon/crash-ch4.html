Someone order a part 4? Order&#39;s up!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

&quot;What&#39;s a peg tube?&quot; asked Minako innocently, cuddling against her 
girlfriend. They had told the others and were now reveling in the 
freedom allotted to them. The rest of the group murmured their agreed 
confusion. 

&quot;It&#39;s a feeding tube. They open up her stomach a tiny bit and put a 
tube in that allows the doctors to get nutrition to her without the 
use of the throat or mouth,&quot; explained Setsuna. &quot;What I don&#39;t know is 
what this says about the doctors&#39; future hopes for Michiru&#39;s 
recovery.&quot; 

Of course, everyone turned to Ami, who cleared her throat and said, 
&quot;Well, there&#39;s not much to really infer from that. They probably think 
that she&#39;ll wake up, but not any time soon. A peg tube operation is a 
difficult one because you&#39;re cutting open a vital organ with a lot of 
acid involved, so they don&#39;t usually do it unless it&#39;s very needed or 
they have hope for the patient, but only in the long-run.&quot; 

Everyone looked hesitant to speak. Luckily, Haruka and Hotaru weren&#39;t 
there; they were with Michiru but had already heard the news. Finally, 
Makoto looked at her lover, speaking without reservations. &quot;So they 
think she&#39;ll live?&quot; 

&quot;Most likely. But remember, she&#39;ll probably be comatose for a while, 
and we have no control when she&#39;s in a coma. It&#39;s beyond our reach.&quot; 
The blue-haired girl&#39;s voice dropped in volume. &quot;Anything could 
happen,&quot; she finished quietly. 

Silence blanketed the room, everyone buried in their own thoughts. 
Minako was just about to suggest dinner when a loud cry broke through 
the stillness of the room. &quot;Michiru-chan! Where are you! 
Michiru-chaaaaaan!!&quot; 

The owner of the voice was a middle-aged woman with familiar 
blue-green hair. She was wearing clothes that made the girls think 
that she was quite rich, most likely. Following the woman was a tall 
man with worried greenish blue eyes that darted everywhere, looking 
for something. Or someone. 

Seeing Ami&#39;s doctor uniform, the woman hurried over and practically 
shouted, &quot;Where is my daughter?!&quot; She began to glare, making Ami feel 
partly annoyed, partly insulted. &quot;Her name is Kaioh Michiru. Where are 
you hiding her?&quot; 

&quot;M&#39;am, please calm down. I&#39;ll take you to her,&quot; said Ami evenly. She 
turned to nod at her friends, giving Makoto&#39;s hand a quick squeeze 
before letting it go and walking down the hall. &quot;Right this way, 
please.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s Michiru-san&#39;s parents?&quot; asked Minako, astonished. 

&quot;What a bitch,&quot; muttered Rei. Minako elbowed her in the side. 

&quot;Be nice,&quot; she scolded. 

The hospital room was just as Ami had left it last time, with Haruka 
holding Michiru&#39;s hand lightly and Hotaru sitting on the end of the 
bed with a faraway look in her eyes. Except both women directed their 
gaze to the two adults that now rushed into the room. Surprise 
overtook Haruka&#39;s demeanor and she stood immediately to allow the 
older woman through, bumping against her daughter in the process. 
Instinctively, she reached out to capture Hotaru in a protective, 
one-armed hug, pulling her roughly against her side. 

&quot;H-hello, Ms. Kaioh, Mr. Kaioh,&quot; she stammered out. 

Haruka had never exactly been on the best terms with Michiru&#39;s 
parents. In fact, they hated her. 

&quot;Don&#39;t address me, you dirty girl. This is entirely your fault. I&#39;d 
bet my life on it,&quot; shot back Kaioh Eiko. 

&quot;Then you would have to die, because all Haruka ever did was try to 
protect your daughter!&quot; intervened Setsuna from the doorway. 

&quot;Yeah, well, she failed, didn&#39;t she?&quot; The old woman&#39;s voice was cold 
and reminded Hotaru of a villain she had seen on Buffy. Even as she 
thought that, though, her papa&#39;s eyes dropped and her gaze avoided the 
two new people in the room. Immediately, Hotaru shoved her elbow into 
her papa&#39;s side. 

Feeling brave, Hotaru stated firmly, &quot;It wasn&#39;t Haruka-papa&#39;s fault, 
and if you blame her, I&#39;ll have to--&quot; 

&quot;Please,&quot; croaked out Kaioh Takashi, who hadn&#39;t spoken at all yet. 
&quot;Please, the last thing Michiru-chan would want right now would be 
fighting. Not amongst her family.&quot; 

Silence returned, and Eiko took Haruka&#39;s seat at Michiru&#39;s side and 
began to sob quietly. Takashi awkwardly tried to pat her on the back, 
but she swatted his hand away. He shrugged and walked out of the room. 
Hotaru watched him go with a glare. The comforting weight on her 
shoulder disappeared when Haruka followed the old man out, brushing 
past Setsuna. 

She caught the old man at the soda machine down the hall. He had just 
finished putting his change in and was pressing the button. Haruka 
stood off to the side as he knelt, took his can of soda, opened it 
with one hand, and took a large swig. &quot;You want anything?&quot; he asked 
gruffly, waving his hand at the snack machine. 

&quot;No,&quot; answered the blonde simply. 

Takashi regarded her with mild interest. &quot;So,&quot; he started at length, 
&quot;what have you got to say for yourself?&quot; 

&quot;I refuse to defend myself while Michiru is in this state. Not even to 
her parents.&quot; Her gaze was even and her expression determined. &quot;I need 
her, Mr. Kaioh. I&#39;m a part of her life and she&#39;s a part of mine, and 
if you can&#39;t accept that, if you can&#39;t see that, then I&#39;d say you were 
a bad parent.&quot; 

&quot;And who are you to tell me about parenting?&quot; he challenged, but his 
voice betrayed his true feelings. 

&quot;I have a daughter and I love her as much as I love Michiru. Because 
of that love I have for her, I would never shun her because of--&quot; 

&quot;I know,&quot; cut in the old man, polishing off his can of soda. &quot;I know, 
Tenoh. I&#39;m not blind like Eiko in there.&quot; Haruka raised an eyebrow. 
&quot;The woman refuses to see how much Michiru-chan loves you. It&#39;s 
practically tearing our marriage apart.&quot; Hesitantly, he placed a hand 
on the girl&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I... I support you, Tenoh. I see how happy 
you make my little girl. Hell, you raised a daughter together. That&#39;s 
something to be said, even if the girl does hate me.&quot; 

&quot;She doesn&#39;t hate you,&quot; interrupted Haruka immediately. &quot;She doesn&#39;t 
hate anyone.&quot; 

He chuckled remorsefully. &quot;Well, she certainly doesn&#39;t love me.&quot; 

&quot;But she would like to, I&#39;m sure. Hotaru-chan&#39;s never turned down an 
offer to get to know someone a little better. Certainly not one from a 
potential grandparent.&quot; Smiling slightly at the old man, she seemed to 
make something of peace with the guy. 

Smiling back, Takashi moved his hand from the woman&#39;s shoulder. &quot;We&#39;ll 
have to do something together. You, Michiru-chan, Hotaru-chan and me.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed, we will.&quot; 

Neither seemed to think, at that moment, that there was any 
possibility of that not happening. At that moment, they were never 
surer that Michiru would recover. 

&quot;And you could show me some of those race cars of yours, eh, Tenoh?&quot; 
the old man prodded. 

The smile turned more boyish, and Haruka said, &quot;Oh yeah, I would have 
done that anyway.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

Michiru&#39;s parents left later that day with a handshake from Takashi 
and a glare from Eiko. By the time all the girls stopped talking about 
the events of the day, the secretary shooed them out of the waiting 
room, insisting that visiting hours were over and the waiting room was 
closing. The only people that didn&#39;t go home were Haruka, Hotaru and 
Setsuna, who spent the night in the hospital room. Hotaru feel asleep 
early on, curled up on Setsuna&#39;s lap on a chair beside the bed. Haruka 
was settled on the large windowsill, looking down at the city at 
nighttime, thinking of time spent on the windowsill that overlooked 
the Tokyo skyline in their old apartment. 

*Flashback* 

Haruka came home to an empty apartment. Empty indeed. Her luggage 
wasn&#39;t even unpacked yet, and the furniture was yet to be delivered. 
There was a race on later that the blonde had wanted to watch, but 
their TV was still in the truck, which was Kami knows where. Michiru, 
her new roommate and partner in Senshi business, was probably down 
taking a swim. As the Senshi of the sea, the aqua-haired teen had a 
knack for swimming. Which was fine by Haruka. She actually enjoyed 
accompanying her new partner to the pool and just lounging around as 
Michiru did laps. Sometimes she even kept time. They had great 
conversations there, too, and Haruka found herself immediately charmed 
by the other girl&#39;s innocent outer shell and flirtatious nature. 
Growing up, Haruka had always been called a flirt, but Michiru was 
every bit as rambunctious as herself. Just on a smaller scale. 

But that wasn&#39;t it. Every time the blonde thought of her new partner, 
something ached. She didn&#39;t want a &quot;partner&quot; out of Michiru. She 
didn&#39;t even want a friend. The selfish side of her wanted to pull the 
girl into her arms and keep her all to herself. It was more than a 
silly attraction. This was love. She was sure of it. 

And the funny thing was, Haruka knew that Michiru was a lesbian. The 
topic of conversation had come up one day at the pool. If anything, 
Michiru had more interest in women than Haruka herself did. She was 
just less open about it. 

&quot;Haruka?&quot; came a quiet voice from the doorway of the bedroom. It had 
been determined that because their combined salaries could only afford 
a one-bedroom apartment, they would alternate weeks on the couch. 

The blonde, who had been sitting on the windowsill, watching a plane 
fly over the city and thinking, was startled out of her revere. &quot;Oh? 
Oh, hey Michiru. I thought you were out swimming,&quot; she said 
half-heartedly. Shifting so that she was sitting on the windowsill as 
she would on a chair, with her back on the window and feet on the 
floor, she asked, &quot;What are you up to?&quot; 

Settling down next to the taller girl, she smiled a dazzling smile 
that practically floored Haruka. &quot;Nothing. Just looking around the 
bedroom. Later you should help me think how we want to arrange the 
furniture.&quot; 

&quot;Ok.&quot; 

The conversation died down for a minute, and Haruka&#39;s eyes became 
distant again. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; asked Michiru cautiously. She knew 
how cold the blonde could be, and was still rather new at judging her 
sudden mood swings, but it seemed that Haruka was thinking about 
something that was troubling her. 

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m alright. I mean, I&#39;m okay. I could be better though.&quot; Kind 
of true, kind of a lie. Very tactful, decided Haruka. She was about to 
slip into another trance when she felt a warm, soft hand enclose her 
own. 

&quot;Haruka,&quot; started Michiru, &quot;in these times, in our life, if there&#39;s 
something that would make you feel better, you should do your best to 
make sure you get it.&quot; &#39;Fine then,&#39; thought Michiru. &#39;If she won&#39;t say 
it, I&#39;ll draw it out of her.&#39; 

&quot;I know that. But certain things, no matter how happy they might make 
you, have the potential to make you even sadder.&quot; 

&quot;That wouldn&#39;t happen,&quot; argued Michiru. 

&quot;You don&#39;t know that.&quot; Green eyes bore desperately into aqua ones. 
&quot;There&#39;s no way to know.&quot; 

&#39;Plan B,&#39; decided Michiru. Reaching up, she placed one hand on 
Haruka&#39;s shoulder and placed the other gently on the back of her neck. 
A chill went up and down Haruka&#39;s spine, a chill that was amplified 
when Michiru placed her lips lightly on Haruka&#39;s. &#39;That&#39;s it for me,&#39; 
thought Michiru before all conscious thought left her as the other 
girl responded with fervor, wrapping strong arms around the 
aqua-haired girl&#39;s waist. Somehow, the taller girl got the shorter 
girl pressed up against the side of the windowsill. Eventually, they 
broke apart, both somewhat flushed. 

Looking her squarely in the eye, Haruka said, &quot;I love you, Michiru. So 
much.&quot; 

A sweet smile graced the other girl&#39;s lips. &quot;And I love you, my 
Haruka.&quot; After placing a quick kiss on the other girl&#39;s lips, she 
joked, &quot;This means you&#39;re stuck with me, Senshi business or not.&quot; 

&quot;I should think it&#39;s the other way around,&quot; replied Haruka, grinning 
in a very flirtatious manner. 

&quot;Good.&quot; 

*End Flashback* 

Closing her eyes against the tears that welled once again in her eyes, 
the Haruka accepted the temptations of sleep for the first time in 
four days. </pre>
