----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usagi sat on Rei&#39;s bed with a pillow hugged to her chest. She was down
to just a few sniffles now and again after retelling the tale of the
disastrous double date. Usually she would have talked to Minako about
such an incident but since the other blonde was involved in it she went
to her raven haired friend who was gracious enough to let her sleep
over.

Rei quietly listened to the whole thing and was now ranting every so
often during her pacing. How could Mamoru do such a thing. Her fists
were clenched as she thought of the barbarian. Here Usagi was, crying
her eyes out because she hurt two of her dearest friends and also
because she had severely upset her boyfriend which in the process of
her brilliant surprise idea... put him in a situation where he got
knocked out. And if that wasn&#39;t enough of a blow to his pride, the
person who did it was a girl. Needless to say he wasn&#39;t talking to
Usagi anymore and went as far to say he would never talk to her again
till she &quot;smartened up&quot; about the friends she chose and that Luna
better do something about the two &quot;freaks&quot;. The real kicker was that
Usagi still loved this jerk. Needless to say Rei was slightly in
turmoil on what to do.

For once Rei wasn&#39;t yelling at her. She was still shouting but none of it
was directed at the moon princess. &quot;How can he be such an asshole. I
personally don&#39;t think you should be with him if he&#39;s truly this kind
of person.&quot; Usagi started sniffling some more and was about to begin
crying when Rei sat beside her and put an arm around her shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m
sorry Usagi-chan but I hate to see him pull this kind of crap on you
all the time. How many times has he broken up with you? I know you love
him and you&#39;re destined... to be together and everything. But maybe
you&#39;re not destined to be with him now. I know it hurts but... I think
you two should call it quits for awhile until he gets his act
together.&quot; It tore her up inside to know that Usagi and Mamoru would
end up together, but what hurt more was seeing Usagi so upset.

The blonde sniffed and leaned into her friend. She was completely
drained emotionally and really just wanted to fall into a deep sleep
and not wake up for a millennia or two. She whispered softly into the
pillow. &quot;Maybe you&#39;re right Rei-chan. I think I will stay away from him
till he has an attitude adjustment. What he said...&quot; she shook her head
and huddled closer into the comfort Rei offered. &quot;That&#39;s borderline
unforgivable. Not only are Minako and Makoto my friends... they&#39;re my
Senshi, my royal guards. I won&#39;t abandon them. They would never abandon
me. I just want it all to go away. I want to go to sleep and when I
wake up... everything will be better.&quot;

Rei was gently rubbing Usagi&#39;s arm. &quot;Then go to sleep princess. Things
might not be better tomorrow, but soon they will be. I&#39;ll make sure of
it.&quot; Usagi nodded mutely as she let the emotional weight drag her down
into a dreamless sleep. Her only thought before drifting into a
peaceful slumber was that of Rei taking care of everything.

Rei gently pulled the blanket over the sleeping girl. She looked so
vulnerable holding the pillow like a child would a teddy bear. &#39;Such a
burden she must be carrying over this,&#39; Rei thought. &#39;I&#39;ll make sure to
add nothing to it.&#39; The fire senshi gently brushed a few strands of
hair off the bunny&#39;s brow and placed a soft kiss on her head. She
resolved again never to make her feelings known to the empathetic girl.
She would never put her in that kind of a position. Rei grabbed her
sleeping bag and an extra pillow and fixed herself a spot on the floor.
Before letting sleep take her, she plotted a way to make things right
between everyone again.

*****

Makoto was sitting on the Aino&#39;s couch. Minako was in the kitchen
getting drinks for them. Luckily her parents were out of town till
tomorrow sometime so they had the house all to themselves. Even Artemis
was out with Luna this evening.

&quot;Have you talked to Usagi yet?&quot; Makoto asked.

Mina came out with the tea and sat next to her. &quot;No she stayed over at
Rei&#39;s last night and I didn&#39;t get a chance to call her today. I
actually want to talk with her in person and I won&#39;t be able to do that
until tomorrow. I&#39;m sure Rei has taken care of her though.&quot;

Makoto nodded and slowly sipped her drink. Minako rested her head on
the taller girls shoulder and sighed. Makoto put an arm around her and
snuggled her closer. &quot;How are you taking all of this angel?&quot; she
whispered softly.

&quot;I think I&#39;m ok. I mean... I was kinda messed up with the initial shock
of him regarding us as he did. But I figure he&#39;s probably feeling very
threatened. And you know how men are when they feel like that. So...&quot;
she shrugged and let her voice trail off.

&quot;So what you&#39;re saying is one bad apple doesn&#39;t spoil the whole bunch.&quot;
Makoto kissed the top of her head.

&quot;Yeah... three out of four is good. But it&#39;s made me very wary of my
parents finding out.&quot; Minako closed her eyes as Makoto began tracing
light patterns on her side. &quot;I honestly have no idea how my mother
would take it if she found out.&quot;

&quot;Well no worries about that now. She&#39;s not going to find out anytime
soon.&quot; Makoto whispered in her ear. &quot;Besides you know I&#39;ll take care of
you if anything happens.&quot;

Minako smiled and chuckled softly. &quot;Yeah. My own personal warrior. That
shot you gave Mamoru was.. was... it rocked. I should reward you for
defending me so valiantly.&quot; The blonde looked up and waggled her
eyebrows evilly.

&quot;I will always defend and protect you my angel. But a warrior does have
many needs. And as beautiful as you are, preserving your virtue comes
at a high price.&quot; Her green eyes flashed mischievously as she leaned
down to steal a lingering kiss.

&quot;Mmm I believe a just payment can be arranged.&quot; Minako encircled her
arms around the taller girls neck. &quot;What is your price for tonight my
love?&quot;

Makoto gently laid the love senshi back and whispered against her ear.
&quot;That you let me share and illustrate my previous conquests.&quot; She began
to nibble gently on the tender lobe.

&quot;Sounds... very... intriguing. I accept.&quot; The blonde arched her neck
invitingly.

Makoto trailed soft kisses down the gentle curve and began in a husky
voice. &quot;My journey began along a trail. Everything was so peaceful. The
river flowed near and could be heard from where I was.&quot; She quickly
flicked her tongue over soft beating pulse now below her lips. &quot;The
flowers around me had the most beautiful scent you could imagine. I
lingered on that trail for many days not wanting to leave its warmth
and elegance.&quot; She nuzzled the crook of her neck lightly before
continuing. &quot;I came to a small pool set against a sloping ridge and
enjoyed its splendor.&quot; Her teeth grazed the smooth curve of her collar
bone. She left a blend of soft nips and kisses in the gentle dip. She
carefully removed Minako&#39;s shirt. &quot;Would you like to know what happened
next?&quot;

The blue eyes were half closed as they gazed into green. A soft sigh
was her only answer. &quot;I continued down the path until I came to a
valley.&quot; Warm lips moved down her chest and felt as though she was
melting as a warmth spread through her at each touch.

&quot;But as I tarried a fog set in and I lost my way. I started to the
east, cautiously making my way up the mountain.&quot; She ran her thumb
along the silken cloth before following with her lips, placing soft
kisses on the edge of the fabric where it met with smooth skin. &quot;As I
was nearing the summit I found...&quot; Makoto paused and was still for a
moment.

&quot;Found what?&quot; Minako&#39;s breathless whisper was cut off by a sharp shush
from Makoto.

&quot;I thought I heard something.&quot; She had a hard look of concentration on
her face which, to any other observer, might have been humorous
considering she was laying upon a half naked Minako. The intruder that
made the noise though was not so amused though.

&quot;WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!&quot; Mrs. Aino stood in the doorway with wide angry
eyes and a fiery red face.

Minako gave a small yelp as Makoto scrambled off her almost falling off
the couch completely. She did manage to throw a pillow onto Minako&#39;s
chest in the process though before she tried finding the discarded
shirt or something else that would be more concealing.

&quot;MOM What are you doing here!?!&quot; Minako was clinging to the pillow as
if it was a shield as she sat up.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t you start with me young lady I want some answers right now.&quot;
Mrs. Aino screeched as her husband came in behind her. He was trying to
piece together what was going on.

&quot;Aino-sama,&quot; Makoto stepped up shielding Minako from view even more,
&quot;this is my fault. Don&#39;t be upset with your daughter.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re that Kino girl aren&#39;t you? What have you been doing to my
daughter! NO don&#39;t tell me! I believe I know exactly what you&#39;ve been
doing. I&#39;m calling the police.&quot; Mrs. Aino stalked to the kitchen and
picked up the cordless phone and a large wooden spoon. As she came out
Minako had dressed herself and was standing beside the tall girl.
&quot;Should have known not to trust an orphan.&quot;

Mr. Aino saw Makoto make a fist and clench her jaw. He also noted that
Minako put a hand on the tall girls shoulder which, though light,
stopped her from stepping forward. &quot;Now dear. Why don&#39;t we let them
explain themselves before we do anything rash.&quot; His eyes were stern as
he looked at his daughter. &quot;A full explanation.&quot;

So it began. Makoto stood silently as Minako told her parents that they
were dating. Mr. Aino kept his wife quiet and asked many of the
questions. How had they met. How long had they known each other. How
long have they been &quot;seeing&quot; each other. Who else knew of their
involvement. Minako patiently answered all of his questions while
keeping a tight hold of Makoto&#39;s hand. When he had heard everything he
wanted he turned to Makoto. &quot;I would like you to leave now. There are
many things we must discuss with our daughter.&quot; His tone brooked no
argument. Makoto looked down at her angel to make sure she would be
alright. She wouldn&#39;t go if there was the slightest bit of pleading in
her loves eyes.

Minako nodded up at her tall warrior and gave a little grin. She didn&#39;t
want to piss her parents off any more than they already were. Her mom
looked like she was about ready to throttle Makoto. The attempt it self
would have been laughable but Minako didn&#39;t want to give Makoto a
reason to do anything... harmful.

Makoto took her leave but before exiting she turned back to the ridged
family. &quot;Call me when this is over.&quot;

****

Ami was busy studying some physic equations when her communicator began
beeping. Makoto was on the other end looking completely ragged. Before
Ami could even get out a greeting the green eyed girl began giving
orders.

&quot;I need you to call over to Usagi&#39;s place and see if Artemis is over
there. If he is tell him to get home as soon as possible... Minako
needs him. If he isn&#39;t there, see if Usagi knows where Luna and he
went. If she doesn&#39;t know make her guess then call me back. I&#39;ll look
for him myself. Got all that?&quot;

Ami nodded. &quot;So do I get to know what all this is about?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Just make sure Usagi doesn&#39;t find out right now.&quot; There was a
short pause a Makoto seemed to gather herself. &quot;Minako&#39;s parents caught
us.&quot;

&quot;Caught you how?&quot;

&quot;Caught us...er... making out on the couch.&quot;

Ami&#39;s hand flew up and covered her mouth. &quot;Was it bad?&quot;

&quot;Well I had Minako&#39;s shirt off and I was on top of her... you do the
math.&quot;

&quot;Are you two ok?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. I don&#39;t know how Minako will be. I had to leave after
being threatened with the police. Anyway, try to find where Artemis is
and get back to me ok.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m right on it.&quot; Ami was signing of as she heard a loud crash from
Makoto&#39;s end. She hoped the dark haired girl hadn&#39;t damaged anything
too badly. She thought it sounded like a dumpster crashing into a brick
wall. But it could have very well been Makoto&#39;s fist. First Mamoru and
now this so soon after. She wondered how her friends were going to
manage though this.

*****

It had been about an hour after Ami had contacted her saying Artemis
was on his way. She had oscillated between pacing around her apartment
and sitting on the couch. Now she figured rearranging the back room
might help. As she was heading that way the buzzer rang. Makoto cursed,
wondering who could be at her door at this time of night. She swung it
open ready to lash out at the intruder.

Instead she stood in the doorway speechless and staring as Minako
waited with a suitcase and a few smaller bags. &quot;So do I get to come in
or do I have to sleep in the park.&quot; The forced laugh was feeble at best
as Artemis pushed pass the tall girl not waiting for a response.

&quot;Hi hunny... I&#39;m home?&quot; Minako put her hand behind her head and
attempted a smile.
