<pre>---Present Time---

&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to come with us?&quot;

I paused, my teacup near my lips, and I give my housemate a look of 
mild disinterest. &quot;Yes I am, Michiru. I see no reason to attend this 
meeting.&quot;

&quot;Neither do we.&quot; my other housemate said with a snort. &quot;But for pure 
entertainment value, it&#39;s definitely cheaper than a movie ticket.&quot;

&quot;Haruka!&quot; Michiru exclaimed, giving her love a playful swat on her 
shoulder. &quot;That is not a very polite thing to say about Usagi and the
others.&quot;

&quot;Yea, yea. I know.&quot; Haruka replied as she rubbed her shoulder as if it 
were 
injured. &quot;But it&#39;s true.&quot; The blonde then muttered under her breath.

I take a drink of my tea and ignore the playful banter between my 
housemates. I refrain from making a sarcastic remark to them (something 
along the lines of &#39;Why don&#39;t you two get a room&#39;) for two important 
reasons. The first is that it would destroy the image of somber 
aloofness I&#39;ve carefully constructed over the past several millennia.

The second is that they would most likely follow my &#39;suggestion&#39;.

As I replace my teacup back onto it&#39;s saucer, I feel a pair of eyes 
upon me. Looking to my right I see my daughter watching me intently, her
violet eyes filled with concern and a touch of sadness.

&quot;Are you sure Setsuna-mama?&quot; she asks almost pleadingly.

I smile slightly. Were it not for all of my experience and training I 
know I would be puddy in her hands and I wouldn&#39;t be able to refuse
anything my daughter would ask of me...not that I don&#39;t refuse her
anything now. I just make a better show if it.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure Hotaru-chan.&quot; I watch as her face falls slightly, 
prompting me to continue, &quot;When you get back, why don&#39;t you tell me all
about what happened today, Ok?&quot;

I watch as Hotaru smiles brightly at my request. Looking at her beaming 
face, I feel a sense of contentment and joy I haven&#39;t felt since...I 
mentally shake my head, refusing to follow that line of thought.

&quot;Ok Setsuna-mama, I will!&quot; Hotaru chirps happily and throws her arms 
around my neck, giving me a quick hug.

I look over at Haruka and Michiru with a goofy grin on my face that 
would do my future Queen proud...on the inside, that is. What the two
Outer Senshi see, however, is a softening of my normal reserved
demeanor mixed with a slightly challenging look.

&quot;We had best be going.&quot; Michiru said with a soft sigh; apparently 
realizing that if our daughter was unable to change my stance on
attending the meeting then nothing would.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Haruka said with a nod. &quot;But I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the rush. 
Rei said to be at the shrine a 10 o&#39;clock. That means that Usagi-chan
won&#39;t be there until a quarter after.&quot;

Michiru gives an exasperated sigh, electing a soft giggle from Hotaru 
as the two follow the blonde out of the dining room. I sit there in
silence, listening to the three exit the house. After a few moments I
hear Haruka&#39;s engine roar to life and my mind adds the obligatory
squealing of tires that one would assume would be present whenever the
racer got behind the wheel.

After a few moments, I finally allow myself to relax. A shuddering 
breath escapes my lips as I rest my head in my hands. With Galaxia
defeated, there is no longer any need for me to constantly stand vigil
over the Gates of Time. No reason to perpetually stand at the lonely
post I&#39;ve maintained for millennia waiting for my Princess and her
Senshi to reawaken. No reason that I couldn&#39;t let down the many
emotional walls that I&#39;ve build up over countless years and share in the
feeling of mutual camaraderie and friendship with the others. No reason,
save one.

Her...

Pai...

Logically, I know that Pai&#39;s reincarnation is not her. While there are 
many similarities between the two, seeing as they both share the same
soul, their lives and experiences are different from each other.
Logically, I know that &#39;she&#39; is not Pai...that they are two different
people; you know, Nurture vs. Nature and all that.

But logic be damned! Ever since she had been born into this new life, 
I&#39;ve watched her grow into the young woman she is today. And it pains me
to see the same smile that was Pai reflected in her reincarnation. She
&#39;is&#39; Pai...but at the same time, she isn&#39;t.

That was the real reason why I avoid contact with the Inner Senshi. 
Every time I&#39;m around her, I see Pai reflected in those eyes. And it
rips me apart inside knowing that she isn&#39;t her.

With a sigh, I stand up from my chair. Gathering my tea, I walk through 
the empty house. Ending up in the sitting room, I relax on a sofa and
look out the large bay windows. Taking another sip of tea, I let my
thoughts wander back in time.

Back to when I first met Pai...

---Silver Millennium---

I stride through the halls of the Lunar Palace, deep in thought. Barely 
paying attention to my surroundings, I ponder the possible reasons why 
Queen Serenity might have requested my presence. Were it dealing with
maters of state, I would have been summoned to either the Crystal Hall
or to the Garnet Room; both where her Majesty would normally conducts
the day to day business of governing the Moon Kingdom.

&#39;Not that Noodle Brain would ever bother me with such trivial things as 
matters of state.&#39; I think to myself, a small smile tugging at my lips.

I remember fondly how, nearly 20 years ago, I was brought to live here 
at the Lunar Palace. I was a mere seven years old and the youngest 
daughter of a minor Noble of the House of Nova. I was also the youngest
person to ever be Awakened as a Senshi...as the Senshi Pluto, no less.
The Guardian of Time. The Keeper of the Gates of Time.

There exists perhaps half a dozen people alive who could comprehend the 
complexities of what my position entails; yet there is only one other 
person besides myself who truly understands what it means to be the
Senshi of Pluto. The sacrifices I must make, the knowledge I must bear,
the limitations I labor under.

That one person was Queen Serenity...also known affectionately as 
&#39;Noodle Brain&#39; to her childhood friend. Me. (Not that I would ever, ever
call her that in public I think to my self with a small grin on my face
that I quickly school back into impassivity.)

No. My Queen and friend wouldn&#39;t have summoned me to speak about 
matters of state. Especially since I&#39;ve been asked to attend to her in
the Royal Suite. Perhaps a personal matter, I muse. It&#39;s been a long
time since I&#39;ve had the opportunity to speak to Serenity about such
things.

My contemplation comes to an end as I arrive at the Royal Suite. I wait 
patiently for Her Majesties guards to announce me. I nod politely to 
Senshi Mars as Senshi Venus enters to Suite to inform the Queen that
I&#39;ve arrived. While I know all of the Senshi, I&#39;ve purposely tried to
distance myself from them. A lesson I learned from the previous Pluto.
The responsibilities of the Senshi of Pluto would extend my life by
several centuries; I would have little time for friends and loved ones
and I would only end up watching them fade before my eyes.

Before I could follow that train of thought further, Senshi Venus 
returned and bade me to enter. It was only after the door was closed,
leaving me standing alone in the foyer of the Royal Suite, that I
wondered why the Senshi were guarding the Queen here deep within the
Lunar Palace. Normally, the Senshi were only required to stand guard
over the Queen when she was making a public appearance. I feel myself
tense and I prepare for the worse. Had something happened to Serenity?
Or perhaps to her newborn daughter?

I shake my head. No, the palace would have been in an uproar had 
something happened to either the Queen or the Princess. But apparently
something &#39;was&#39; going on. I ruefully realize that there was only one way
to find the answer to my question. I relax and open myself to the ties
that bind me to my Queen. Feeling the gently pull of her presence, I
follow my connection to her and find myself in the nursery.

&quot;Iria-chan! You&#39;re here! Please, come in and make yourself comfortable!&quot;
Queen Serenity exclaimed from a rocking chair as she held her 16 month 
old daughter in her arms.

&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; I say solemnly and I kneel low before her.

I can practically feel Serenity pout at me as I hear her say, &quot;Now 
Iria-chan, you&#39;re my oldest friend. You know there&#39;s no need to be so 
formal when we&#39;re in private.&quot;

&quot;As you wish...Noodle Brain.&quot; I intone seriously as I look up at her, 
doing my best to hide my grin.

&quot;Oh...you...&quot; Serenity says in exasperation as her daughter laughed 
happily.

I rise from my knees and sit in a nearby chair at Serenity&#39;s 
insistence. For the next half an hour or so we chat about little things
just like two old friends catching up with each other. Most of our talk
revolves around young Serenity and the trials and tribulations that
Serenity has been facing raising her new daughter. And, before I know
it, I find myself with the dubious privilege of changing the Princesses
diaper.

After laying the Princess down for a nap, we exit the nursery and retire
to the sitting room. Once we are seated, I see a subtle change take
place within my hostess. She is no longer my childhood friend, the
&#39;Noodle Brain&#39; with whom I conducted many a mid-night raid upon the
kitchen; but the Queen, the sovereign ruler of the entire Solar System.

And I cannot help but morn what has become of my dearest friend; 
although I understand its necessity.

&quot;Are you familiar with a place by the name of Griffor&#39;s Cove?&quot; My Queen 
asked me.

I close my eyes in thought. While I might be blessed; or perhaps cursed;
with a perfect memory, the name fails to ring any bells. I open my eyes 
to look at my Queen and, before I can voice my lack of knowledge, she 
begins to speak again.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry yourself, Iria-chan. Up until a week ago, I never heard of 
Griffor&#39;s Cove either. In fact, it took Luna several days of searching 
through old census data to even find any mention of it. For your 
information, Griffor&#39;s Cove was a small fishing village near the 
southern polar region of Oberon. The last recorded census data from
nearly 60 years ago listed its population as being about four dozen. We
know now that, up until recently, its population was less than half of
that.&quot;

At another time, I would have smiled at the thought of the stuffy, newly
appointed advisor searching through countless records, hunting for 
information about an obscure village on one of Neptune&#39;s moons; all the 
while berating herself that she &#39;should have&#39; known everything about 
it. However, there was one thing that I kept coming back to as I
replayed her Majesties words over in my mind.

&quot;&#39;Was?&#39;&quot; I ask quietly.

Nodding solemnly, my Queen begins to speak softly. &quot;Yes. A week ago 
Senshi Neptune was returning to her Palace on Neptune proper from a
routine patrol of the Outer System when she felt the &#39;seas of Oberon
calling to her&#39;, as she put it.&quot; She paused a moment before continuing,
her voice filled with a heartbreaking sadness. &quot;When Senshi Neptune
arrived, she found the wreckage of a  small, yet vibrant, fishing
village.&quot;

&quot;Youma.&quot; I say in a small voice; my Queen&#39;s sorrow my own.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

We sit in silence as I feel my anger begin to rise. Youma. The dark 
creatures of destruction whose only reason for existence is to 
annihilate all live in their path. They have haunted mankind far longer
than recorded history. Preying on the weak, Youma exist to drain the
life and rend the souls of the living.

&quot;Senshi Neptune did hunt down those creatures, correct?&quot; I ask, my rage 
creeping into my voice.

Queen Serenity looked at me for a moment before replying. &quot;It was...not 
necessary.&quot;

I blink. Hard. &quot;Your Majesty?&quot;

With a long sigh, my Queen began to speak again. &quot;When Senshi Neptune 
arrived at Griffor&#39;s Cove, she searched for the cause of its fate. To 
her horror, she found the bodies of 22 people. But, to her utter
surprise, she also found the remains of a score of Youma.&quot;

I school my features to prevent the shock from appearing on my face. I 
don&#39;t know which startles me more; the fact that so many Youma had
attacked the village at one time, or that they had all been destroyed. I
resist the urge to summon the Time Staff and whisk myself away to the
Gates of Time to search for the answers myself. Not only would such an
action be an insult to my Queen, but I also know my friend well enough
to know that she would tell me everything she knew.

&quot;How?&quot;

Giving me a small smile that doesn&#39;t reach her eyes, she tells me. 
&quot;There was one survivor. Luna?&quot; she calls over her shoulder.

A moment later, a black cat enters the sitting room. &quot;Your Majesty.&quot; 
she says as she bows low.

As the young advisor enters the room, I see someone following behind 
her. A young girl, perhaps no more than four years old, awkwardly
wearing a dress her size in the latest fashion. She stops just inside
the doorway and sketches an awkward curtsy while softly muttering
something that I assume is a polite greeting.

&quot;This is Pai. Pai? This is the Lady Iria; Senshi of Pluto.&quot; My Queen 
says warmly to the child.

I politely nod my head at the young girl as I watch her intently. &#39;She 
must be the survivor.&#39; I think to myself as my heart goes out to this
young child.

I see her look at me with wide eyes as a faint blush appears on her 
delicate face. She fumbles a curtsy in my direction and softly mutters a
greeting to me; her eyes remaining cast downward.

&quot;Come here, child.&quot; My Queen says gently.

Pai slowly moves forward until she is standing next to my Queen. It 
doesn&#39;t surprise me at all when she engulfs the young girl in a warm and
loving embrace. I find myself smiling as I see Pai carefully returning
the hug. Few beside myself know this side of Queen Serenity, and I find
myself being filled with contentment for being one of those few.

My Queen releases Pai from the embrace, keeping one arm around her 
shoulders. She then looks at me intently, trying to gauge my thoughts. 
I sit silently, returning her gaze; only to feel my stomach turn
slightly as I see a playful glint in my friends&#39; eyes. A glint that I
remember all too well.

&quot;Watch.&quot; she commands me in a soft voice.

Turning her attention back to Pai, my Queen cups her free hand under 
Pai&#39;s chin and gently lifts her face upward. She then closes her eyes
and I feel a surge of power coming from her. I sit patiently as I feel
my own power begin to sing in counterpoint to the power that my Queen is
using. Then, to my utter surprise, I feel an echo; no, another
counterpoint; that slowly begins to gain in strength.

I gasp sharply as I look at Pai. Her eyes are closed and her face is no 
longer showing the awkward shyness I saw a moment ago. In fact, her 
young face now holds a graceful bliss as her own power begins to flow
through her. I absently notice my tiara disappear as the sigil of Pluto
blazes forth on my brow. I watch intently as, to my absolute shock, a
sigil appears on Pai&#39;s forehead as well.

Mercury.

Author&#39;s Notes...
Incase you&#39;ve haven&#39;t figured it out yet, this is going to be a
Ami/Setsuna match-up. I&#39;ve been meaning to do this for a while
now but since my other fics seemed to have stalled, I decided
to go ahead and write this.

Oh, and before anyone can make any (or should I say, certain?)
comments, this fic will span nearly 20 years time in the
Silver Millennium.

Any C&amp;C would be appreciated.
