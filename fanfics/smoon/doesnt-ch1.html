<h1>Doesn't Really Matter</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nelly.html">The Almighty Nelly</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;Those rumors&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133;Are true aren&#146;t they? You really are a woman?&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#148; Haruka said nothing, but stared out into the clear night sky. 
Walking closer, Michiru rested her head against Haruka&#146;s shoulder 
blades. 

&#147;Haruka&#133; I don&#146;t really care if you are male or female&#133;&#148; 

&#147;It doesn&#146;t? You&#146;re the first person I&#146;ve met that has ever said 
that&#133;&#148; Haruka scoffed. 

&#147;Really, Haruka. It doesn&#146;t really matter&#133;&#148; Michiru whispered, 
wrapping her slender arms around a rock hard, washboard stomach. 

Doesn&#146;t matter what your friends tell you 
Doesn&#146;t matter what my family&#146;s saying too
It just matters that I&#146;m in love with you
It only matters that you love me too
It doesn&#146;t matter if they won&#146;t accept you 
I&#146;m accepting of you and the things you do
Just as long as it&#146;s you, nobody but you,
Baby, baby

&#147;Michiru&#133; would you believe me if I said I had fallen in love with you 
the first time I saw you?&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133; Yes&#133;&#133; yes I would&#133;&#148;

My love for you is unconditional love too 
Gotta get up, get out, get up, get out, get up
And show you that it

&#147;Kaioh Michiru&#133;&#148; Haruka started, turning around to face the smaller 
girl, &#147;I have loved you ever since I saw you for the first time years 
ago&#133;&#148;

&#147;Years?&#148; 

Doesn&#146;t really matter what the eye is seeing 
&#145;Cause I&#146;m in love with the inner being
Doesn&#146;t really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you&#146;re in love with me
Doesn&#146;t really matter what the eye is seeing
&#145;Cause I&#146;m in love with the inner being
Doesn&#146;t really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you&#146;re nutty, nutty
Nutty for me

&#147;Hai, years. I met you back in junior high. Do you remember a boy 
walking you to class on your first day? The one that everyone didn&#146;t 
ever go anywhere near?&#148;

Thinking back to her first year of junior high, Michiru brought up a 
picture (in her mind) of a tall, sandy blonde boy with eyes that 
looked like a caged wild animal&#146;s. Gasping, Michiru looked into 
Haruka&#146;s eyes. 

Just what I asked for, you&#146;re so lovin&#146; and kind 
And I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re mine

&#147;T-that was YOU?!&#148; she said, receiving a nod from Haruka. Michiru&#146;s 
eyes softened as she saw Haruka shift nervously.

Doesn&#146;t matter if you&#146;re feelin&#146; insecure 
Doesn&#146;t matter if you&#146;re feelin&#146; so unsure 
&#145;Cause I&#146;ll take away the doubt within your heart
And show you that my love will never hurt or harm
Doesn&#146;t matter what the pain we go thru
Doesn&#146;t matter if the money&#146;s gone too
Just as long as I&#146;m with you nobody but you
Baby, baby

  &#147;No wonder I fell for you when I saw you at that gas station&#133; I fell 
in love with you back then, Haruka, since you didn&#146;t care what anybody 
thought about you&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Y-you did?&#148; Haruka asked, shocked. Smiling, Michiru nodded. 

Your love for me is unconditional I see 
Gotta get up, get out, get up, get out, get up
And show you that it

&#147;Well, that&#146;s nice to hear, but are you sure that you&#146;d want to be in 
love with a female?&#148; the tomboy asked.

A grin trespassed on Michiru&#146;s gorgeous face.

Doesn&#146;t really matter what the eye is seeing 
&#145;Cause I&#146;m in love with the inner being
Doesn&#146;t really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you&#146;re in love with me
Doesn&#146;t really matter what the eye is seeing
&#145;Cause I&#146;m in love with the inner being
Doesn&#146;t really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you&#146;re nutty, nutty
Nutty for me

&#147;Actually&#133;&#148; Michiru slinked up to Haruka, pressing Haruka&#146;s body into 
the glass door behind them, and her body into the racer&#146;s. &#147;It doesn&#146;t 
really matter to me&#133; because you&#146;re all I could ever hope for&#133;&#148;

Oh just what I asked for, you&#146;re so lovin&#146; and kind 
And I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re mine. 

Michiru purred in the back of her throat as she felt a gentle hand 
stoke her long aqua tresses. &#147;You&#146;re my dream come true, Haruka&#133;&#148;

&#147;And you are mine, Michiru&#133;&#148; Haruka whispered into her ear, making her 
shiver delightfully. 

My love for you is unconditional too
Gotta get up, get out, get up, get out, get up
And show you that my love is true
And it&#146;s just for you

Michiru sighed as she was pulled into a loving embrace. &#145;I feel so 
safe here&#133;&#146; she thought &#145;I&#146;m so glad I left _____&#133;&#146; 

&#145;Michiru&#133;&#146; Haruka thought, wrapping her arms more tightly around the 
smaller woman&#146;s waist, &#145;Thank the gods I found you&#133;&#146; 

Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you
I can&#146;t believe my dreams come true
I finally found somebody whose heart is true
And best of all, is you love me too

&#147;Michiru?&#148; lifting her head from her soul mate&#146;s shoulder, Michiru 
blinked, staring into deep emerald eyes. 

&#147;Hai, Haruka?&#148; smiling, Haruka pulled Michiru into a passionate, yet 
innocent kiss. Moaning, Michiru wrapped her arms around Haruka&#146;s neck, 
running her fingers through the short blonde hair of her new 
girlfriend. 

Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you

A few passion-filled minutes later, Haruka pulled away, resting her 
forehead against her girlfriend&#146;s. Smiling, Haruka pecked her on the 
nose. Staring deeply into her eyes, the next words that Haruka said 
made them more intense. 

I can&#146;t believe my dreams come true

&#147;Aishiteru Michiru. Now and zutto, for all eternity&#133;&#148;

I finally found somebody whose heart is true

&#147;Haruka&#133;&#148; Michiru smiled, tears brimming her eyes. &#147;I love you too&#133; 
for all eternity&#133; I&#146;ll never stop loving you&#133;&#148; 

Smiling, Michiru and Haruka closed their eyes and brought their faces 
together for another love-filled kiss&#133;

And best of all, is you love me too

&#145;Aishiteru&#133;&#146; they both thought, as the nighttime lights slowly 
sparkled around them. 

And for a split second, the moon seemed to resemble a face smiling&#133;

&#147;I wish you both happiness in this life&#133; dear Uranus and Neptune&#133;&#148; the 
&#145;moon,&#146; known as Serenity, smiled, and disappeared. 

&#133;&#133;&#133; And the rest, they say, is another story.
