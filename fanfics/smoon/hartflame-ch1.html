<h1>Heart and Flame</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/voidruka.html">VOIDRuka</a><br> </h2>
<pre>ADMIN NOTE: As the description says, &#39;Mamoru doesn&#39;t take the news very 
well.&#39; This fic contains a rape scene, but is ultimately a story of 
two girls in love.  You have been warned.

This is the first fanfic I ever wrote. Hope you enjoy. 

------- 

&quot;Hurry up we&#39;re late,&quot; the raven-haired girl said with frustration in 
her voice, &quot;It&#39;s your fault if we don&#39;t make it to our classes, 
Usa-chan!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m coming, you don&#39;t need to be so rude, Rei-chan!&quot; said the blonde 
irritated. 

You wouldn&#39;t know by the looks of the two girls that they were best 
friends. During time of need, they were always there for each other. 
While running to school Usagi slipped on some rocks and fell forward 
exposing her satin pantied tush to Rei. At the sight of this Rei 
grinned with an evil look on her face. Usagi not knowing that her 
friend looked down at her with lust, but quickly helped Usagi up. 
Brushing herself off, Usagi looked up and her bright sapphire eyes met 
with two lovely amethyst eyes. 

&quot;Rei-chan what do you think you are doing?&quot; exclaimed Usagi in 
surprise. 

&quot;Uh, nothing&quot; said Rei as she quickly resumed her stance, &quot;What would 
I be doing?&quot; trying to make herself sound innocent. 

Usagi looked down at her watch and shrieked. They were way too late 
for school. And there was no way to make it in time to reach their 
third class. 

&quot;Oh well,&quot; said Rei &quot;I guess we will just have to wait for everybody 
else to get out of school. Why don&#146;t we just go back to the shrine.&quot; 

&quot;No way! Did pyro just say she wanted to skip?&quot; said Usagi shocked. 

&quot;It&#39;s not like that it&#39;s just&#133;&quot;Rei paused for a few seconds &quot;well it 
is too late to be showing up that&#39;s all.&quot; 

&quot;Really&#133; I believe that for a second.&quot; replied Usagi slyly &quot;So where 
is this guy you&#39;re hiding huh? There has got to be a guy otherwise you 
wouldn&#146;t be so reluctant to skip school.&quot; Said Usagi accusingly. 

Rei blushed profusely at this accusation and shot Usagi a harsh glare. 
Rei replied, &quot;There is no guy and actually I don&#39;t really feel like 
going to school today, Odango-Atama!&quot; 

&quot;I told you not to call me that! Pyro!&quot; Said Usagi in anger. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; 

They both started heading for the Hikawa Shrine when Usagi stopped 
abruptly. She spun around and faced Rei. 

&quot;Why do you want to go back to the shrine anyway?&quot; Asked a curious 
Usagi. 

&quot;Well&#133; I&#39;m not sure&#133;&quot; Rei hesitated and spoke again, &quot;I guess I don&#39;t 
want to be seen in public&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Go on&#133;&quot; Usagi folded her arms. 

&quot;In public with you!&quot; said Rei with an evil grin. 

&quot;Oh Rei-chan you are always so mean!&quot; said Usagi &quot;Why do you always 
have to be so mean?&quot; 

At that moment small tears began to gather at the corners of Usagi&#39;s 
crystal blue eyes. Rei drooped her head down realizing what she said 
hurt her best friend, and she replied, &quot;I don&#146;t know but maybe I can 
answer that when we get to the shrine, okay? That will give me a 
little time to think.&quot; 

As they made their way to the shrine neither of them made a sound. Rei 
began to think about why she was being so mean to Usagi, she was being 
overly protective of herself. Why was she doing this? Then something 
hit her, something that made her cringe with disgust of herself, her 
feelings have been going berserk when she was around Usagi and the 
usual annoyance of her friend had dropped dramatically. As they 
reached the stone steps leading up, Usagi turned around and faced Rei 
waiting for her answer. 

&quot;Can we go into my room to discuss this?&quot; said Rei &quot;I don&#146;t think I 
want anyone else to hear.&quot; 

&#39;Hear what, is it that secretive?&#39; Usagi asked herself. 

They climbed the stone steps that lead to the Hikawa Shrine and 
entered. They left their shoes at the entrance and took their school 
stuff with them. Usagi followed Rei into her bedroom. There they sat 
down on Rei&#39;s futon. The silence between them grew while Rei fought 
with herself trying to figure out why she had been acting like she 
had. 

&quot;There was something you wanted to tell me, Rei-chan?&quot; asked Usagi 
softly. 

Carefully choosing her words before she answered, Rei said, &quot;Well 
there is this person that I really like and I don&#39;t know how to tell 
them&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Go on if you want.&quot; Said Usagi coolly. 

&quot;Also I don&#146;t know if they feel the same way about me.&quot; Rei replied. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure whether or not I can help you in that department,&quot; Usagi 
continued &quot;Do you try to hint to them that you like them?&quot; 

&quot;Well I have sorta been really mean to them lately, but I guess that 
doesn&#146;t help much does it?&quot; Rei said. &#39;Oh my gosh what am I doing, how 
can I go through with this. She doesn&#146;t even know that she is the one 
I am in love with. How can I possibly tell her?!&#39; 

&quot;You know what it sounds like you need, to me?&quot; asked Usagi. 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;You need a night away from all your chores and the temple.&quot; Usagi 
then smiled and went on &quot;I will ask my mom if it&#39;s cool with you 
spending the night. We will have so much fun. And maybe while you&#39;re 
over, you will find a way to tell this person how you feel. How does 
that sound?&quot; 

Without even thinking &quot;I would love to. Thanks Usa-chan!&quot; Rei leaned 
over and grabbed Usagi in a bear hug. 

&quot;Great! See you tonight then.&quot; Usagi then started to head home. While 
walking she thought to herself. &#39;Since when did Rei-chan start calling 
me Usa-chan? Oh well.&#39; 

Usagi arrived at her house 20 minutes after her discussion with Rei at 
the Hikawa Shrine. She asked her mother if it was cool with Rei 
staying the night and she said, &quot;She can come over on one condition 
Usagi, you have to have your room and everything else cleaned up!&quot; 

&quot;But, MOM! I don&#146;t have time for that.&quot; Yelled Usagi. 

&quot;You&#39;ll do it or she won&#39;t come over, and even if she doesn&#146;t come 
over you&#39;re still cleaning your room and everything else!&quot; 

&quot;Fine!&quot; said Usagi, who then hmphed. 

Five hours later Usagi&#39;s mother yelled, &quot;Usagi-chan! Rei-chan is here. 
Your father and I are going out for the evening, Chibi-Usa-chan is 
over at Hotaru-chan&#39;s and Shingo-kun is at one of his friend&#39;s. We&#39;ll 
be back around three, so behave!&quot; 

Usagi came running down the stairs and gave her mother a hug and kiss 
good-bye. Usagi and Rei then went upstairs. When Rei entered Usagi&#39;s 
room she looked amazed to find that Usagi had cleaned the entire room. 
&quot;Wow, so you can clean. If you would try to learn not to be late for 
school and you would be set for life!&quot; Rei said sarcastically. Usagi 
pouted at this remark and then sat down on her bed. 

&quot;So what do you want to do now Rei-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Thought we could watch a movie, I brought some with me if that&#39;s okay 
with you.&quot; Said Rei. 

&quot;How about Mononoke-hime? I really like that one.&quot; 

&quot;Okay.&quot; 

Rei put her belongings away and joined Usagi downstairs. Rei handed 
the movie to Usagi who put it in and sat down on the couch next to 
Rei. Rei could smell Usagi&#39;s hair and perfume, she could tell it was a 
lavender smell that had overwhelmed her senses. &#39;Oh Kami-sama she 
smells so good. That perfume is so enticing. Get a hold of yourself, 
Rei.&#39; 

Halfway through the movie Usagi fell asleep and slumped over and 
landed on Rei&#39;s lap. Not thinking Rei put her arm around Usagi. Usagi 
woke a few minutes later and found Rei&#39;s arm around her. Startled by 
this she quickly said, &quot;Rei why do you have your arm around me?&quot; Rei 
quickly pulled back and said &quot;I don&#146;t know?!&quot; Frightened, Rei stood up 
and ran up stairs into Usagi&#39;s room, all the while tears streaming 
down her crimson cheeks. By the time Usagi caught up to Rei, she found 
her face down on the bed. Her cries were being muffled by one of the 
pillows. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Rei-chan?&quot; asked a very confused Usagi. &quot;Why are you 
crying?&quot; 

Usagi sat down next to her friend on the bed, grabbed Rei, and held 
her. Rei leaned her head on Usagi&#39;s shoulder as she continued to cry, 
while Usagi continued to comfort her. Usagi waited until Rei had 
stopped crying and then asked her calmly &quot;Okay, calm down and tell me 
what&#39;s the matter.&quot; 

Still sniffling Rei replied, &quot;I don&#146;t know what has come over me 
lately&#133;&quot; a tear came down her cheek and Usagi wiped it away. Rei 
looked up at Usagi and then out of nowhere, she pressed her lips to 
Usagi&#39;s. Rei waited for her to pull away, but instead found that Usagi 
leaned into the kiss. It lasted for about two minutes when Usagi broke 
off. 

&quot;Where did that come from?&quot; Usagi stared at Rei in wonder. 

&quot;I don&#146;t know? I&#39;m sorry, maybe I should leave.&quot; 

&quot;No, please don&#146;t, we need to talk.&quot; 

Rei wondered how Usagi could still stand to be in her presence after 
what she had just done. 

&#39;Why would she still want me to stay? It doesn&#146;t make sense. I had 
expected her to push me away and tell me to get the hell away from 
her.&#39; Rei felt ashamed and Usagi could tell. 

&quot;Rei-chan is it okay if I ask you something?&quot; 

&quot;Hai, what is it?&quot; 

&quot;When you said that you liked someone, is this someone one of the 
senshi?&quot; 

&quot;Hai.&quot; 

&quot;And does she have golden blonde hair?&quot; 

&quot;Hai.&quot; 

&quot;Is she beautiful, and is she in this room with you at this very 
moment?&quot; Usagi questioned her again. &quot;Well?&quot; 

Rei looked down at her hands folded in her lap and reluctantly 
answered &quot;Hai.&quot; 

Usagi looked shocked at Rei for a moment and regained her composure. 
She took her thumb and index finger, and took hold of Rei&#39;s chin. She 
leaned forward and she kissed Rei with more passion than she had ever 
done with Mamoru. 

Rei and Usagi continued to kiss. Letting each other explore the 
other&#39;s body. While taking a moment to breathe, Rei stopped Usagi&#39;s 
hands from unbuttoning her shirt. 

&quot;Usa-chan, wait. Should we really be doing this?&quot; Rei questioned. 
&quot;What about Mamoru-baka? If you do feel the same way about me, what 
are you going to do about him?&quot; Usagi didn&#146;t answer; she was too busy 
staring at the angel that sat next to her. &quot;Hmmm? What did you say?&quot; 

&quot;What are we going to do about Mamoru-baka?&quot; 

&quot;Well I hate to say this, but the only reason I stayed with him so 
long was because we were bonded together. We were soul mates. But, I 
just don&#146;t feel that link between me and him anymore.&quot; Usagi hesitated 
and then continued, never looking away from the beautiful sight in 
front of her. &quot;When we kissed I felt something, I knew that it wasn&#146;t 
just a kiss. It meant a lot more. Like something deep inside of me 
woke up. Yet, I don&#146;t know what it was.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#146;t want to be the cause for your relationship being destroyed 
between you and Mamoru. You know that, right?&quot; Rei stopped for a 
moment to gather what she wanted to say. &quot;Do you still love him?&quot; 

&quot;I honestly can say that I don&#146;t. I don&#146;t know why I liked him in the 
first place. He has betrayed me so many times. And with the so-called 
&#39;brainwashing&#39; when we were fighting Queen Beryl, he has hurt me so 
many times. Never having a moment when he totally redeemed himself. He 
treated me like crap and broke up with me once over a dream because he 
was too big a baby to discuss it like adults.&quot; 

Usagi fought back tears. Until she couldn&#39;t stand it any longer and 
broke down crying. Rei comforted her, she felt like beating the living 
hell out of Mamoru. &#39;That worthless rat, how could he do that to poor 
Usa-chan.&#39; She laid a gentle kiss upon Usagi&#39;s forehead then said, 
&quot;It&#39;s okay Usa-chan, I&#39;m here for you. Cry as much as you need. Just 
don&#39;t drown us.&quot; Rei let out a little laugh. When Usagi stopped crying 
she continued. 

&quot;You know what? Mamo-chan doesn&#146;t deserve me. I&#39;m too good to go 
wasting tears on a jerk like him! I think I will tell him tomorrow.&quot; 

&quot;Usa-chan, how are you going to tell him?&quot; Rei said. &quot;Inquiring minds 
want to know, namely me!&quot; 

&quot;Well, I will tell him that I need to talk to him and for him to meet 
me at Crown Game Center. Then, I will tell him that it isn&#39;t working 
out between us and that I don&#146;t love him anymore. He will beg me not 
to leave. Then as I walk away, I will say that there is someone new in 
my life. And I shall end it there, making him wonder who could be 
better than he is.&quot; 

&quot;Damn, Usa-chan whatever you do keep it like that. It is perfect, he 
will be crushed. One question though. What will the other senshi 
think? I know Haruka and Michiru will be happy for us because they 
went through what we are going through right now. Should we tell them 
or try and keep it a secret? You know that if we try and keep it 
secret the others will find out by the way we act.&quot; 

&quot;Maybe we should focus on Mamoru-baka and then worry about the other 
senshi later.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, that sounds good.&quot; Rei looked at the clock. &quot;It&#39;s 2:30 a.m. 
don&#146;t you think we should go to sleep? After all you have to break the 
news to Mamoru-baka.&quot; 

&quot;Good point Rei-chan.&quot; 

The two girls went upstairs to get their pajamas on. After they got 
dressed, they got in bed. Usagi drifted off to sleep before Rei could 
tell her she loved her. &#39;Oh well I guess I could wait to tell her 
later.&quot; No sooner had she stopped thinking about it, sleep had taken 
over her. 

Later that morning, Rei and Usagi were asleep when Usagi&#39;s mom came in 
to see if they were awake. She woke them up and Rei got dressed. Usagi 
did the same after taking a nice long shower, which she needed. 

&quot;Bunny-chan, I have to go to the shrine, but I will talk to you later. 
Bye!&quot; 

&quot;Bye, I am going to the Game Center, Mamoru-baka is waiting for me 
there. Bye!&quot; 

Usagi walked down to Crown Game Center, it was a nice arcade that also 
had the newest Sailor V game to play. Usagi spotted Mamoru and sat 
down next to him. 

&quot;Good morning, Usa-ko, how have you been?&quot; said Mamoru in a cheerful 
voice, not sensing the impending doom that was soon to come to his 
worthless and pathetic life. 

&quot;Why good morning Mamo-chan! How did you sleep? &#39;Horribly I hope.&#39; We 
have to talk.&quot; Said Usagi slyly. 

&quot;About what?&quot; 

&quot;About us. This relationship isn&#39;t working out. I have given my all 
and realized it would come to this. I don&#146;t love you anymore. I don&#146;t 
have any feelings for you anymore.&quot; Mamoru&#39;s mouth dropped in terror 
and expected her to clobber him upside the head for something he said 
or did wrong. 

&quot;Are you sure about this Usa-ko?&quot; 

&quot;Please stop. I am not your Usa-ko anymore. I don&#146;t want to have any 
more to do with you.&quot; 

&quot;Wait Usagi-chan, what did I do wrong. I have done everything for you. 
I love you deeply and sincerely! Please don&#146;t say this. I love -&quot; 
Before Mamoru could finish his sentence Usagi cut him off. 

&quot;There is no hope begging me to not leave you. In fact, it is 
disgusting me to be in your presence when you are in this state. I am 
taking my leave. I have found another to love who returns my love 
equally. See you around, baka!&quot; 

Usagi left and Mamoru just sat there astonished. &#39;Who the hell could 
be better than me. I am going to be the King of Crystal Tokyo for 
Kami-sama&#39;s sake!&#39; Usagi smiled all the way to the shrine, waiting to 
tell Rei what happened. 

When Usagi had reached the Hikawa Shrine steps, she leapt them two at 
a time. She found that Rei wasn&#39;t inside the shrine, so she walked 
around the shrine and shouted, &quot;Bunny-chan is here! Where is my tall, 
dark and beautiful loud-mouth brat?!&quot; Then out of nowhere Rei, who was 
hiding in the bushes, leapt out and tackled Usagi to the ground. Then 
a pair of ruby red lips locked Usagi&#39;s rosy pink lips and held each 
other in a loving embrace. 

&quot;So how did he take it?&quot; 

&quot;Well let me put it this way&#133; he started begging me to not leave him.&quot; 
Rei and Usagi both let out evil laughs. 

Meanwhile, back at the Crown Game Center, Mamoru mumbled to himself. 
&quot;Who the hell could be better than me? When I find that pussy, I&#39;ll 
make him regret even laying eyes on my Usa-ko! Now all I have to do is 
follow her around&#133; yeah that will work. But, I have to make sure she 
never spots me.&quot; 

Back at the shrine, Rei and Usagi had started to discuss how they were 
going to break the news to the other senshi. 

&quot;Hey Usa-chan, are you even ready to tell the other senshi about us?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I want to tell them, but then again, I don&#39;t. What if 
they are disgusted with us? Or don&#39;t to be friends with us anymore, 
and think that we wouldn&#39;t be able to full fill our senshi duties?&quot; 

&quot;Haven&#39;t you noticed that lesbians make good senshi? Haruka and 
Michiru are great at the job they have to do. So what makes you think 
that we wouldn&#39;t be able to do the same?&quot; 

&quot;Good point, but I just don&#39;t think I am ready to tell the others yet. 
Okay?&quot; 

&quot;Fine, tell me when you think the best time is to tell them.&quot; 

The next day after school, Rei and Usagi walked to the Hikawa Shrine, 
where all the senshi are meeting to study and then discuss senshi 
business. Usagi thought that at the meeting would be the best time to 
tell the others and Rei agreed. 

In a low, quiet voice, &quot;There is Usa-ko, turning the corner. Now I 
just have to follow her until she reaches the shrine.&quot; Mamoru paused 
for a moment when he heard a low, husky voice and laughter like when 
he would talk to Usagi. He looked around the corner to find that Usagi 
was alone with Rei and not a guy in sight, &quot;Hmm, there had to have 
been a guy around. She used to laugh and carry on like that around me. 
But, where did he go? I swear I heard a low husky voice, like that of 
a male&#39;s!&quot; 

&quot;Usa-chan, that&#39;s not right!&quot; Rei said half-serious and half-giggling. 

&quot;Oh no, I&#39;ve been bad&#133;&quot; Usagi said with a twinge of mischief in her 
voice, &quot;&#133;are you going to punish me?&quot; she said in a low voice. 

&#39;Damn it, I can hear that voice again. He must have slipped in that 
store when I looked around the corner. I will look once more and then 
wait &#39;til they start walking again.&#39; Thought Mamoru. Mamoru waited 
until he could hear them walking away before slinking out of the 
shadows. But, as soon as he followed Usagi, he noticed that Rei and 
had been the only one he saw with her. 

And with that, Mamoru decided to give up his mission. He headed for 
his apartment complex, confused out of his mind. He thought to himself 
for a while and had an evil plan cultivated in his mind to win Usagi 
back. 

&#147;Perfect! I have the ultimate plan to get Usa-ko back!&#148; And with that, 
Mamoru was off to his apartment complex to put his plan into motion. 

Meanwhile, back at the shrine, &#147;Where are those two?&#148; said Makoto. 

&#147;It&#146;s not like Rei-chan to miss a meeting.&#148; 

&#147;Yeah, Ami-chan, it is totally like Usagi-chan. But, not Rei-chan!&#148; 
Minako chimed in. 

When Rei and Usagi had gotten to the steps of the shrine, the others 
were already in there, including Haruka and Michiru, waiting for them. 

Suddenly at that exact moment, Rei and Usagi walked into the shrine. 
The others just stared, seeing that Rei and Usagi had walked in 
together, holding hands. Rei spoke up, breaking the silence. 

&#147;And what are you guys doing, just sitting there, mouths agape?&#148; 

Usagi piped up, &#147;Yeah! Why are you guys just staring at us?&#148; 

Then all of a sudden, Setsuna and Michiru both handed Haruka twenty 
dollars. 

&#147;Thank you.&#148; Haruka slowly drawled, and took the money from both of 
them. While they muttered under their breathe. 

&#147;Let&#146;s not bet against Haruka-baka in the future&#133;&#148; Said Setsuna to 
Michiru very quietly. Michiru nodded in reply. 

Rei furrowed her eyebrows. &#147;What the hell was that? Haruka-chan you 
better explain&#133;&#148; Said Rei, while tapping her foot. 

&#147;I think I will leave that up to you AND Koneko-chan!&#148; Haruka put her 
hands behind her head, as she leaned back in her chair next to 
Michiru. Who was still debating with Setsuna on if they should get her 
back. 

At that precious point, the miko and her princess both turned lovely 
shades of crimson. &#147;Uh&#133; well um&#133;&#148; Rei paused. &#147;Why don&#146;t you explain 
Usa-chan?!&#148; 

&#147;Whaa??! You want me to??&#148; Said Usagi flailing her arms about. As Rei 
got behind her and pushed her forward, Usagi tripped on a wrinkle in 
the carpet and crashed down on the hard floor, Rei falling down on top 
of her. 

Ami and Makoto both shook their heads. &#147;Oi&#133;&#148; Said Makoto, &#147;Once a 
klutz, always a klutz.&#148; 

It took two hours for Usagi to explain the entire situation, getting 
help from Rei once in a while. Everyone was happy for Rei and Usagi, 
all except for Luna. Luna was furious and was thrown into a closet 
until she stopped cursing at Usagi and Rei. Claiming that they were 
going to ruin Chibi-Usa&#146;s future. Usagi thought that it would be nice 
without the brat hanging around all the time. Artemis didn&#146;t stop 
twitching during the entire explanation, as Minako held and petted 
him. 

It was getting late and everyone had already left. &#147;Rei-chan?&#148; 

&#147;Hai?&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, but I can&#146;t spend the night with you tonight.&#148; Rei looked 
downtrodden, and Usagi kissed her on the lips. &#147;I know&#133; you want me to 
stay. But if I do, I will be in SO much trouble with mom.&#148; 

&#147;I know&#133; you better go before it gets too late, or dark for that 
matter. Would you like me to walk you home?&#148; Rei wiggled her eyebrows 
suggestively and poked Usagi a few inches below her belly button. 
Usagi&#146;s eyes bugged and she slapped Rei&#146;s intruding hand away. 

&#147;Are you TRYING to make it so that I don&#146;t go home at all tonight?&#148; 

&#147; No, of course not. Why would I do that?&#148; Rei asked innocently, 
wishing the entire time that Usagi would change her mind and stay. 

&#147;And no, I don&#146;t need an escort.&#148; Usagi put her hands on her hips. 
&#147;I&#146;m perfectly capable of walking to my house by myself, thanks much.&#148; 

&#147;Aw&#133; fine&#133; but you better leave before I do something that WILL make 
you stay.&#148; Rei grinned mischievously. Usagi rolled her eyes and gave 
Rei a quick little kiss on the lips. 

&#147; I will see you tomorrow, okay?&#148; 

&#147;Oookay&#133;&#148; Rei started to pout, but slapped Usagi&#146;s butt when she 
headed for the door and looked up at the ceiling, whistling when Usagi 
looked back at her. &#147;I thought you were leaving.&#148; 

&#147;I am! That is if you stop teasing!&#148; 

&#147;Ok, ok, I&#146;m done&#133; sheesh&#133;&#148; 

Usagi walked down the stone steps, away from the shrine. Thinking 
about Rei and all the things that she would love to do with her, but 
couldn&#146;t, tonight anyway. Usagi was so busy with her thoughts that she 
didn&#146;t notice someone walking behind her for the past fifteen minutes. 

&#147;Why hello, Usagi-chan. What are you doing out so late?&#148; Said a 
familiar voice. 

&#147;Huh? Who&#146;s there?&#148; 

&#147;It&#146;s only me, Mamo-chan. Nothing to worry about&#133;&#148; He said with a 
devilish grin on his face. &#145;Yet.&#146; He thought to himself. 

&#147;Oh&#133; you&#133; what do YOU want?&#148; 

&#147;Nothing much&#133;&#148; Mamoru grabbed her wrist and flung her down on the 
ground in an alley. 

&#147;Mamoru-baka! What are you doing?!&#148; Screamed a frantic Usagi. &#147;Get 
away from me!&#148; 

&#147;No. I don&#146;t think so. You will pay for the suffering you have caused 
me!&#148; 

Mamoru screamed back at her and pinned her down to the ground with one 
hand. He closed the distance between their mouths in a matter of 
seconds, while Usagi struggled to get away from him. He ripped her 
shirt open down the front and fondled her breasts, squeezing them hard 
enough to hurt her. Fat tears rolled down Usagi&#146;s bright red cheeks. 

Stilling holding her pinned to the ground, Mamoru pulled at the cotton 
panties she wore until they were complete off. He got up form his 
squatting position and straddled Usagi so she couldn&#146;t get away. He 
unbuckled his belt and unzipped his pants, releasing his manhood from 
within the confines of his boxers. 

&#147;Like I said, you will pay for what you did.&#148; He snarled at her, as 
she stared at him with pleading eyes. 

&#147;Mamoru-baka, stop! Someone help! Please!&#148; She cried, still struggling 
from his grasp. 

He continued his assault by pinning her with one hand and lifting the 
edge of her skirt past her most private place. Mamoru placed himself 
just mere inches away from Usagi&#146;s virgin-sex. He glared at her 
coldly. He thrust himself deep within her, tearing her hymen apart, 
her screams echoing off the brick walls of the alley. The tears 
streamed down her face endlessly, she wished that he would stop. 

&#147;I&#133; will&#133; make&#133; you&#133; love&#133; me&#133; again!&#148; He shouted, with each word he 
thrust himself into her. 

Mamoru kept thrusting into her, until she lay there unconscious. He 
exited her, using her skirt to clean himself off. He zipped his pants, 
then buckled his belt and kicked Usagi hard in the side. 

&#147;Fuck you, you stupid bitch!&#148; He screamed in a blind rage. 

With his job done, he walked the short distance to his apartment 
building. On the way he saw a woman standing on a corner in a short, 
red dress and high heels. 

&#147;Well, hello there. Would you like an escort to where ever you are 
going?&#148; 

&#147;Sure, but I&#146;m going home.&#148; 

&#147;Then I guess I am too.&#148; She winked at Mamoru and then walked the rest 
of the way to Mamoru&#146;s apartment with him. 

The next morning, Rei went out for a jog to clear her mind. While 
going past one of the alleyways. Something caught her eye. &#145;Oh 
Kami-sama&#133; please let it be someone else&#133;&#146; She walked down the alley 
and looked down at the body lying before her eyes. She swallowed hard 
and walked closer. 

&#147;Usa-chan!&#148; Rei cried out. She quickly picked up the girl and ran back 
to the shrine with her slung over one shoulder. 

&#147;Yuuchiro! Get the car now!&#148; 

&#147;Hey Rei-chan, what&#146;s wrong? Usagi-san! What happened?&#148; 

&#147;I don&#146;t know! But we have to get her to the hospital! SO GO GET THE 
CAR!!&#148; Yuuichiro ran around the back and pulled the car around. Rei 
got Usagi into the car and they took her to the hospital. 

Rei paced in the waiting area, mumbling under her breathe, while 
Yuuichiro was seated, reading a magazine. Yuuichiro looked up from his 
magazine to watch Rei pace back and forth. 

&#147;Rei-chan&#133; you okay?&#148; He said, brushing his wild bangs out of his 
view. 

She grunted in reply and continued her tirade to the invisible 
audience in her head. She kept pacing in the waiting area until a 
nurse came out to address them. 

&#147;Excuse me miss, are you Hino Rei?&#148; The nurse asked gently. 

&#147;Hai. Can I see her?&#148; Rei asked hopefully. The nurse nodded. 

&#147;Follow me please.&#148; The nurse took Rei to the ICU where Usagi was 
being kept at the moment. 

&#147;What happened to her?&#148; 

&#148;Well&#133; there are bruises on her breast, on her inner thighs, and some 
internal bleeding. Two of her ribs were broken on the left side. We 
took care of her, so she should be fine within a month or so. The 
doctor who took care of her would like a few words with you.&#148; 

The nurse walked away, leaving Rei with Usagi. A few moments later, a 
tall, thin man in a white lab coat and a stethoscope around his neck 
came over to Rei. &#147;Hello young lady, I&#146;m Dr. Loire. As the nurse may 
have told you, I would like to ask you a few questions.&#148; 

&#147;Hai, sir.&#148; 

&#147;First, do you have any idea what happened with your friend?&#148; 

&#147;Iie, this morning I went out for a jog to clear my mind and I passed 
an alley, oh about fifteen minutes away from the Hikawa Jinja. I saw 
something and decided to check it out. I found her unconscious. Then 
we rushed here with her.&#148; Rei took a deep breath after her 
explanation. 

&#147;Well, she has been beaten up pretty badly. Do you know anyone who 
might want to harm her?&#148; Rei&#146;s eyes started to water at hearing how 
her dear princess was hurt. 

Rei shook her head and looked at her princess. &#147;Iie, everyone loves 
her. She&#146;s a lighthouse, guiding people lost at sea. Steering them in 
the right direction.&#148; 

&#147;You must be a Shinto priestess. Am I correct?&#148; The doctor gave Rei a 
stern look. 

&#147;Hai.&#148; 

&#147;When we took her clothes to examine them&#133; we found traces of semen on 
her skirt. When was the last time you saw her?&#148; 

&#147;Last night, when she left to walk home. I offered to walk with her, 
but she rejected it.&#148; 

&#147;Well&#133; the sperm specimens are down in the lab being studied. Do you 
know anyone who might have had sexual relations with her?&#148; 

Rei got nervous; &#147;Well&#133; she broke up with her boyfriend a few days 
ago. But I don&#146;t know if they&#146;ve done anything though&#133;&#148; Rei was cut 
off by a high beeping tone. 

The doctor and Rei both looked at Usagi. Her heart rate had gone up 
really high and was having trouble breathing. 

&#147;Nurse! Someone get in here and help me stabilize her!&#148; 

Rei panicked and a nurse whisked her away, back into the waiting room. 
Rei started trembling and Yuuichiro went to her side. &#147;Oh 
Yuuichiro-kun&#133;&#148; He held her close, trying to comfort her while nurses 
ran around the ICU. 

Usagi opened her eyes and found herself sitting in a meadow. She 
looked around, sniffing the air. A heavenly scent lingering in the 
air. At the far end of the meadow laid a flower garden of roses, 
lilacs, lilies, and morning glories. As she approached the lovely 
spot, she saw a black-haired angel descend from out of nowhere. 

As Usagi approached her, she spoke. &#147;Don&#146;t be scared&#133; You&#146;re safe 
here&#133;&#148; As soon as those words were spoken, she disappeared. 

&#147;Usa-chan!&#148; Usagi turned around, her hair flying out to the sides as 
she acknowledged the person. 

&#147;Rei-chan? What are you doing here?&#148; 

&#147;I came here to be with you&#133; It&#146;s ok&#133; I won&#146;t ever let anyone hurt 
you&#133; ever again&#133;&#148; Rei ran up to the smaller women and hugged her, 
gently kissing her tender lips. As if she were so frail, that any 
rough gesture to her, she would surely crack. </pre>
