<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 3 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Sailor Moon and Sailor Jupiter aolong with Yung Hu stood, watching in 
confusion as two creatures fought in the middle if the street.

One was defentiatly like that from the other night; it had negative 
energy just flowing from it heavily.

The other was what was so surprising. It was male, large and buff. He 
looked as Yung Hu did; cat based with feathered wings. He was based 
off a lion, obviously, because he had a thick mane and a tail with a 
tuft of hair at the tip. He was sandy in color,his mane a darkish 
brown. What the werd thing about him tho was, if he was a lion 
gargoyle, why did he have stripes along his body like a tiger? The 
stripes where a faded out color of that of his mane. The lion wore a 
pair of ragged fighting pants, dark blue in color, and a sash around 
his waist which was red. Around his neck was a gold &#39;color&#39; that was 
form fitting around his massive neck.

The two senshi and tiger warrior stood as the two creatures fought. 
The lion picked up the youma, held it above its head, roared out, and 
then threw it into a nearby building. The youma hit the building hard, 
the bricks caving in from impact. 

&quot;Should we help,&quot; Sailor Moon asked Jupiter quietly.

&quot;I..I don&#39;t know if he needs it,&quot; she relied back. Jupiter looked over 
at Yung Hu, who had a disbelieving look on his face. &quot;Yung Hu? What 
should we do?&quot;

He said nothing as he watched the battle continue.

The battle carried on, the youma getting the snot kicked out of it. As 
the lion adavnced on it again, the youma vanished. The lion was 
obviously confused as it looked around for the youma. Then its ears 
perked up and every one glanced sky wards and quickly moved, avoiding 
the acid ice crystals that came crashing down toward them.

The Lion roared and jumped from place to place to avoid being hit. He 
roared in pain when one crystal zoomed past him and hit his left ear, 
slicining it a bit.

&quot;We&#39;ve gotta help him,&quot; Jupiter said, standing from her spot. &quot;Jupiter 
thunder crash..ZAP!&quot;

She sent the lightening upward, not knowing where the youma was. The 
light lit up, and although she didn&#39;t hit the creature, the sky lit up 
enough to wher you could see its shadow.

Yung Hu&#39;s eyes glowed red as he ran toward the lion on all fours, then 
lleapt up, spread his wings and zoomed toward the youma above the 
lion. Yung Hu warpped his arms around the youma and fell back towards 
the earth, slamming them both into the concrete.

The youma kicked Yung Hu off of itself angerily, sending him into an 
alley way. You could hear Yung Hu ram into a large tash bin from the 
street.

The youma sneered and was again tackled, this time by the lion, who 
wrapped its massive hands around the youma&#39;s head and snapped its 
neck. The youma fell to the gorund before turining to dust.

Yung Hu walked out of the ally, rubbing his head.

&quot;Just&#133;ow&#133;&quot;

Jupiter smiled at him. He was alright.

The lion rubbed his left ear and found it was still bleeding slightly. 
He felt his ear and sighed, knowing this attack wound would leave a 
very bad scar and a piece of his ear missing.

The lion began to walk off when Sailor Moon stopped him.

&quot;No, wait,&quot; she called out, running toward him.

The lion stopped but did not turn around to face her. 

&quot;Who are you,&quot; Sailor Moon asked him. She heard him growl deep in his 
throat, but that was his only reply.

Jupiter and Yung Hu now joined Sailor Moon at her side and looked at 
the new warrior. 

He growled again and answered in a deep voice, &quot;A friend.&quot; He then 
began to walk away again.

Yung Hu walked after him a bit and called out, &quot;Raiga?&quot;

The lion stopped again, and slowly turned to face the tiger. His eyes 
held confusion, but then he smiled slightly.

&quot;The others are here,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;ll be joining the fight soon.&quot; 
Yung Hu nodded his understanding, the lion, now known as Raiga, turned 
and walked away, vanishing as he did so.

~ When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please to tame your wild wild heart
I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It&#39;s hard to find relieve and people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door 
And you feel like you can&#39;t take anymore~

Ace ran as fast as he could. All around him was darkness. Only a 
single spot light followed him. He had tried to change, but he 
remained a house cat.

He panted as his speed increased. Soon, another animal joined him. 
Another house cat. This cat was tanned in color, tufts of hair on his 
head and on his chest flailed around as he ran along side of Ace. He 
had light stripes on his fur, and resembles a tabby cat.

The light shining on the two felines faded slightly, and as Ace looked 
up, he saw two enourmus black birds&#133;no..they werent birds. Gargoyles! 
The other two Raiga had been speaking of. They were there now! Large 
and black crows was what they resebled, their feahers on their bodies 
so smooth that it looked more like skin. One was male and the other, 
female. Their eyes were red and brown, that being the only actual 
difference in their faces. They were solid black, their eyes being the 
only color on them besides their clothing.

Ace suddenly felt lighter as he ran and looked out infront of him and 
noticed he was now soaring above Tokyo. He was now in his gargoyle 
form as well. He looked over at his left and saw Raiga was with him, 
replacing the tanned tabby cat. Ace, now as Yung Hu, noticed Raiga&#39;s 
ear. It as still torn from the prievious battle.

&#39;I remember them&#39;, Yung Hu thoguht to himself. &#39;Raiga, Tori and 
Karasu&#133; I remember them. Its been so many eons since I saw them 
last&#133;.&#39;

&#39;Someone is coming&#39; said a voice inside Yung Hu&#39;s head. &#39;We must 
protect her to ensure the safety of the future and mankind.&#39;

Yung Hu nodded. The voice belonged to Karasu, the male twin of the 
black birds. He had a quieter voice, as did his sister, when compared 
to Raiga and himself.

&#39;Who is she,&#39; Yung Hu asked inside his head, knowing they would all 
hear him. 

&#39;You will know when you see her,&#39;Tori said.

&#39;And when she comes, we will all be together again,&#39; Raiga said. Yung 
Hu nodded as he felt his compaions slowly vanish, until he was all 
that was left&#133;.

&#133;.In the dark&#133;..

&#133;..Running again&#133;..

~ Let me be the one you call
If you jump I&#39;ll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You&#39;re not alone&#133;~

&quot;He said we have to awake the others,&quot; Makoto told Luna.

&quot;But, why,&quot; Usagi asked.

Makoto had called a meeting at Usagi&#39;s the afternoon Ace had woken 
from his dream. The girls and Luna and Artemis sat in Usagi&#39;s room 
disscussing what should be done.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Makoto said. Makoto looked over at Luna. &quot;Do you think 
we should? Ace said the new gaurdians can&#39;t protect their wards until 
you give their memories back. And we need the guardians for this 
fight.&quot;

Artemis remained silent. He was all for getting the senshi back as 
they were. He knew they&#39;d be happier that way.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Luna said. &quot;Can&#39;t you two handle it?&quot;

Usagi looked as if she were thinking, as did Makoto. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure we could, Luna,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;But what if Mako-chan and I 
are both injured during a fight? Its happened before where two senshi 
are harmed and only three can battle. We all need to be here!&quot;

Luna blinked. She knew Usagi was right, but didn&#39;t want to admit to 
it.

&quot;We&#39;ll see, I supposse,&quot; Luna said. &quot;We&#39;ll see if we need them or 
not.&quot;

&quot;We will Luna,&quot; Artemis said. &quot;We will.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

A few weeks passed, and Artemis was lying on Minako&#39;s bed, thinking. 
He sighed as Minako walked in, dumped her book bag onto the floor and 
fell face first onto the bed. 

He looked at her and stood up and streched then padded his way over to 
her and purred in her ear as he rubbed against her face. 

Mianko flipped over and scratched behind Artemis&#39;s ear. &quot;Oh, Arty. I&#39;m 
so alone. I have no friends at school, no love..I&#39;m just lonely. I 
feel like I&#39;ll find someone someday and everything will be fine. But I 
have another feeling like I did have someone like that, and they were 
taken from me. Does that make any sense?&quot;

Artemis meowed in response. He now seen how much Minako actually 
missed Makoto although she didn&#39;t remeber who Makoto was.

Minako sighed and pick the white cat up and began to cradel him as she 
paced her room. She felt as though she needed to be doing something, 
and that her cat knew what it was. Smiled down at him.

&quot;It would be so cool if you could talk, Arty,&quot; she said, wistfully.

Artemis sweatdroped and meowed again.

He vowed right then and there to bring Minako&#39;s, Ami&#39;s, and Rei&#39;s 
memories back.

Luna&#39;s preferance be damned.

~When you&#39;re all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You&#39;re caught in a one way street
With the monsters inside your head
When hopes and dreams are far away and
You feel like can&#39;t face the day~

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I can&#39;t believe this,&quot; Makoto said to herself as she ran down the 
streets, a newspaper over her head as the rain poured down. &quot;I may be 
the senshi of lightening, but who said anything about me liking 
storm?? And why is it storming in January anyway??&quot;

Makoto bent her head down as she ran faster, trying to get out of the 
rain. Why had she decided to take a walk with out her car?! She 
mentaly kicked herself for not checking the weather first.

Makoto sighed as she saw her apartment building come into veiw. She 
ran to the inside of the door and sighed once again. As she was about 
to go inside, she heard a small voice behind her and turned to see 
Minako across the street, kicking her car tire. 

Makoto&#39;s heart tightened at the sight of the blonde and couldn&#39;t help 
but run across the street to help.

&quot;Konnichi wa,&quot; Makoto said smiling as she reached Minako. 

&quot;Konnichi wa,&quot; Minako replied back. 

&quot;Need some help,&quot; Makoto offered.

Minako&#39;s face just seemed to light up. &quot;Oh, hai. My car 
just...stopped. I pulled over in time before it died completely in the 
middle of the road. I dont know whats wrong.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;I see. Can you pop the hood so I can look under it?&quot;

&quot;Oh sure thing.&quot; Minako walked to the driver&#39;s side of the car, and 
pulled a lever next to the drivers seat, releasing the lock on the 
hood. &quot;There.&quot;

&quot;Arigatou,&quot; Makoto said, lifting the hood. The rain pouring down onto 
her head was forgotten as she peered inside to see what was wrong.

&quot;Anything?&quot;

Makoto leaned over to see what may have caused the engine to die. But 
she saw nothing wrong. She checked the oil; it was where it should be. 
She checked to make sure all of the wires were secure, and sure enough 
they were.

Makoto sighed and shook her head. &quot;Iie. I dont see anything wrong. 
Unless its internal and where I can&#39;t see, I dont know whats wrong.&quot;

Minako groaned. &quot;What am I going to do?&quot;

Makoto took a sideways glance at Minako as she shut the hood, and bit 
her lip. &quot;My apartment is across the street. You can call a towing 
comapny to come get the car so they can look at it.&quot;

Minako seemed to hesitate, but she felt as though she could trust 
Makoto and nodded. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;Any time. This way.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

They entered the loft and Minako gazed around nervously. Makoto 
removed her wet jacket and hung it up and then smiled at Minako. &quot;Do 
you need a towel for your hair or anything? How about some tea?&quot;

Minako blinked and smiled. &quot;Thank you. Tea would be fine.&quot;

Makoto smiled and nodded back the headed for the kitchen. &quot;Feel free 
to sit down. You won&#39;t hurt anything in your wet clothing.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you. But i think its best if I continued to stand.&quot;

&quot;Suit yourself.&quot;

Minako glanced around Makoto&#39;s apartment and saw a shelf above the 
televison with pictures sitting on it. She walked towards the shelf 
when Makoto caught her.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m afaid I didn&#39;t catch your name.&quot;

Minako blinked and blushed. &quot;Oh. Heh, my name is Aino Minako. Yours?&quot;

&quot;Kino Makoto. I&#39;ve seen you before.&quot;

Minako blinked and looked at Makoto as she made her way to join her. 
&quot;We have?&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Makoto said placing her hands inside her pockets. &quot;I came up to 
you once, mistaking you for someone else.&quot;

Minako blinked then smiled. &quot;Oh yeah. I remember you now. You called 
me Minako.&quot;

Makoto blushed slightly and nodded. Minako smiled. She felt safe with 
Makoto, but she didn&#39;t know why.

Minako glanced up at the pictures, obviously pictures of Makoto&#39;s 
friends. Then her eye caught sight of one of Makoto with her arm 
wrapped around another girl. And the girl, in return, had her arms 
around her. 

&quot;Who&#39;s this girl? She looks like me.&quot;

Makoto&#39;s mind raced. &quot;Uh..thats my old girlfriend. She left a few 
months ago.&quot;

&quot;Minako?&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai. Thats why I approached you that day. You see, she 
left with out saying good bye. She was...taken from me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that,&quot; Minako said, placing the frame back onto the 
shelf. &quot;She could pass as my twin, ne?&quot;

&quot;Hai, she could..&quot; Makoto trailed off. Talking to Minako about her as 
if she were another person was confusing and hard on Makoto. She 
wanted nothing more than to hold the blonde close.

A high pitched whistle made Makoto look into the kitchen. &quot;Water&#39;s 
done. The tea wil be soon, too. The phone is over there if you want to 
try calling the towing place.&quot; Makoto then turned to walk back into 
the kitchen.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Minako said, heading over to the phone.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Alright, thank you.&quot; Minako sighed as she hung up the phone. Makoto 
came into the living room with a tray of snacks and the tea.

&quot;Whats wrong,&quot; Makoto said, sitting the tray down.

&quot;Their driver for the tow truck left early. They&#39;re closing down 
shop.&quot; Minako sighed and leaned back into the chair she was sitting 
in.

&quot;I can take you home if you&#39;d like. Or call you a cab,&quot; Makoto 
offered.

Minako looked up at Makoto and smiled. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t mind taking me 
home?&quot;

Makoto smiled as she handed Minako a cup of tea. &quot;Iie, not at all. 
It&#39;ll cost you tho.&quot;

&quot;...What?&quot;

&quot;Dinner and a movie?&quot; Makoto smiled at Minako befor sipping her tea. 
She then chuckled and smiled more. &quot;I&#39;m just kidding, Minako-san. I&#39;ll 
take you home.&quot;

But Minako was smiling. &quot;Would you really take me out on a..uh..date?&quot;

Makoto blinked and looked up at Minako. &quot;Sure. But, if you&#39;re not 
comfortable with it-&quot;

&quot;Oh, no. Its alright,&quot; Minako said smiling. &quot;I&#39;d really enjoy it, I 
think.&quot;

Makoto smiled from ear to ear. &quot;Um...friday at 5? I&#39;ll pick you up 
then?&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;Its a date.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

~Let me be the one you call
If you jump I&#39;ll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You&#39;re not alone~

Ace smiled slightly as Makoto ran around the apartment, getting ready 
for her &#39;date&#39;. She was very nervous, seeing as how she had to gain 
Minako&#39;s trust all over again, but was confident she could as Minako 
agreed to seeing her again.

&quot;ACE!&quot; Makoto ran into the living room, holding two ties. &quot;Which 
one...?&quot; She held them both over her black silk shirt, wanting Ace&#39;s 
opinion.

&quot;I like...the orange one,&quot; he answered, knowing Makoto would toss it 
aside. 

She nodded and ran back to her room to finish getting ready. 

&quot;Sheesh, Mako-chan. Whats the big deal? What&#39;s got you so giddy,&quot; he 
asked, jumped from the couch and ran to the bed room. He smiled when 
Makoto had gone with the white tie instead of the orange one.

&quot;Date.&quot;

&quot;Obviously. But I mean with who? You&#39;ve never been so jumpy over a 
date before unless it was with Mina-&quot; He blinked and looked up at 
Makoto. &quot;You didn&#39;t..&quot;

Makoto shot him a sideways glare before smiling and finished tieing 
her tie. &quot;What ever do you mean, Ace?&quot;

Ace smiled from cat ear to cat ear. &quot;You asked her out??&quot;

Makoto smiled and explained to Ace what had happened that rainy 
afternoon he was out with the other two guardians. 

&quot;..It was a joke, but she actually wanted to go.&quot;

&quot;Sugoi,&quot; Ace said. The smile had yet to leave his face. &quot;Where ya 
taking her?&quot;

&quot;I have reservations at that new French Resturaunt that just opened. 
Minkao *loves* French food.&quot; Makoto sat on her bed to tie her shoes. 
&quot;Now, if she&#39;d rather go someplace else, thats fine too. You know I&#39;d 
never make her do something she didn&#39;t want to.&quot;

Ace nodded as Makoto stood. 

&quot;How do I look?&quot; Makoto was wearing nearly all black, except for her 
tie which was white. 

&quot;You look great. Have fun and try to be home late, ok?&quot; Ace smiled and 
winked.

&quot;Oh geez,&quot; Makoto said as she left the apartment, grabing her leather 
trench coat as she left.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;This place is really nice, Makoto-san,&quot; Minako said, as the waiter 
pushed in her chair for her.

Makoto smiled as she sat across from Minako. She wanted to say, 
&#39;Anything for you, Mina,&#39; but thought against it. Instead she said, 
&quot;Hai, it is. I&#39;ve never eaten here before. And please, call me 
Mako-chan, alright?&quot;

Minako nodded and flashed Makoto a smile as she glanced thru her menu. 
&quot;Wow, I hope I can pay for this. Its very expensive. I should have 
brought more money.&quot;

&quot;Why? I&#39;m the one paying, not you.&quot;

Minako looked up at Makoto and blinked. &quot;No, Mako-chan. I couldn&#39;t-&quot;

&quot;No, I insist. Please, order anything you&#39;d like.&quot; Makoto smiled and 
looked down at her menu.

Minako blushed and agreed.

------------------------------------------------------------

While they ate, they talked about themselves. Minako&#39;s past was 
completely different then from how Makoto remembered. Minako still 
grew up in the orpahnge, but had no friends there. She was able to 
move back to Japan when shewas 14 to live on her own with her 
inheirtance thar her father had left her.

Makoto told Minako the truth for the most part, leaving out the small 
fact that she and Minako had gone to the same orphange and were the 
other&#39;s &#39;first&#39;.

They finished their dinner quickly, but ate their desert slowly. They 
had no intention of going to a movie that night, but neither wanted to 
leave the other&#39;s presence.

When they did decide to leave, Makoto paid the bill (which made Minako 
blush because she felt as tho she should have paid for her own food).

Makoto walked silently beside Minako as they walked together to the 
parking lot. Makoto opened Minako&#39;s door and closed it after Minako 
climed in. Makotothen climbed into the driver&#39;s seat and they were 
off.

They were silent for the most part, Minako giving Makoto a shy smile 
once in a while. Makoto loved having Minako around. It made her worry 
about what would happen after they said goodbye that night.

Makoto&#39;s thoughts of her and Minako were cut short as she screamed out 
in pain and swearved to the side of the road, and parked up on the 
sidewalk slightly.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said worriedly. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Makoto was bent over the steering wheel, holding her head. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know. I think&#133;&quot; She raised up and rbbed the middle of her forhead. 
Then she caught sight of where she had pulled over at.

Rei&#39;s temple.

Makoto was about to pull of again when she and Minako heard two 
screams come from the temple. Makoto quickly jumped from the car and 
ran up the temple stairs, Minako following her.

~ Because there has always been heartache and pain
And when it&#39;s over you&#39;ll breathe again
You&#39;ll breathe again..~

Youma. And it was attacking Ami. Rei was behind it trying to do a 
counter curse.

&quot;Makoto!&quot; Minako and Makoto looked over and down in the opposite 
direction, Artemis and Luna runnin toward them. &quot;We need the senshi-Oh 
Kami&#133;&quot;

Artemis just realised what he had done. Minako looked as tho she were 
about to pass out. Artemis looked at Luna, who sighed and nodded. 

&quot;Transform, Makoto. I&#39;ll take care of Minako!&quot;

&quot;How do you know my name?! How can you talk!??&quot;

Makoto looked at Minako and sighed then called out her transformation, 
and transformed into Sailor Jupiter.

Jupiter ran forward towards the youma, a giant snake man, and threw 
forward a lightening attack that made it drop Ami. In the back of her 
mind, Jupiter would have sworn she saw the two guardian cats run 
forward to Rei and Ami.

The snake threw its taloned hand out at Makoto, cutting her along her 
shoulder. It turned quickly to swipe its tail at her, but Jupiter 
heard the four words she&#39;d foreve cherish.

&quot;Venus Love Chain Encircle!&quot; Makoto saw a bright flash and a chain of 
hearts shoot forward and wrap around the monster&#39;s neck.

Then Jupiter heard other attcks.

&quot;Mars flame sniper!&quot;

&quot;Shabon Bubbles!&quot;

Fire and Ice encased the youma, and when the ice cracked and vanished, 
so did the youma. It was dead.

Yung Hu flew down, and in his arms was Sailor Moon, who was shocked 
and happy to see al lher friends were back.

They all powered down, Minako and Makoto catching glimpses of the 
others.

In the shadows, however, lurked three shadowed winged warriors. Their 
eyes glowed brightly, and they were all smiling.

~Let me be the one you call
If you jump I&#39;ll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
