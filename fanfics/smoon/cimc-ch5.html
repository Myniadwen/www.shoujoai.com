<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>It had been a stupid, amateur mistake...

It would not happen again...

The hunter would follow the vampires forever, until the head of their 
Queen hung in her hands...

She screamed, almost as if she was cursing the world for her mistake..

...The sunrise made the sky look as if it was dotted with streaks of 
blood...

...The mistake would not be made again..

...The hunter smiled, and watched the blood-stained sunrise...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tremens factus sum ego et timeo,
dum discussion venerit atque venture ira:
quando coeli movendi sunt et terra....

I am seized with fear and trembling
until the trial is at hand and the wrath to come:
when the heavens and earth shall be shaken...
 
Makoto was starving. He head hurt, she was woozy, confused, and the 
doctor, whatever her name was, was running around like a chicken with 
its head cut off. She looked so nervous and jittery, it was almost 
endearing.
 
Almost.

Makoto winced, and held her head. She had a feeling something was 
terribly wrong with her. Every time she would try to conjure up images 
of any meal, her stomach would twist itself into a knot.

The doctor....will make a good meal, no?

Makoto blinked, and looked toward the ceiling. &quot;Who...who said that?&quot; 
she whispered, looking around.

Why...I am your Queen, your mother. My child, you must take her, 
quickly, or you will die.

Makoto growled under her breath. &quot;Whoever you are, get out of my head.&quot;

Why? Am I bothering you? I am simply telling you what you need to know.
 
Makoto winced. &quot;I said, get out of my head...&quot;
 
Hmm...very well...but...you need sustenance...oh well...I&#146;ll leave you 
to your thoughts..
 
Makoto frowned, rubbing her temples and staring at her feet. &quot;Yeah, you 
do that...&quot; she trailed off when she noticed Ami staring at her in 
confusion. She rolled her eyes, and hopped of the examination table. 
&quot;What? You don&#146;t talk to yourself sometimes? I know you have to, working 
in a place like this.&quot; Ami nodded warily. &quot;Well...um...yes...&quot; she 
handed Makoto a sandwich wrapped in plastic. &quot;This is all I could 
find...I&#146;m sure you&#146;re  used to more...gourmet type...food....um...are 
you alright?&quot; She cleared her throat, and bit her lip nervously, staring 
at Makoto thoughtfully.

Makoto stared back, and then she frowned, green eyes flickering oddly.
 
You see...can&#146;t you feel it? Her blood...pulsing through every vein, 
precious life giving blood...take it. You must. Make her blood your 
own...do not be a fool.
 
Ami stared at Makoto&#146;s eyes for a moment, transfixed.
 
And then she ran.
 
Hurry! Do not let her escape. She knows. Our secret dies...with the last 
of the vampires!
 
Makoto had no idea what she was doing, but somehow, she knew it had to 
be done. At an inhuman speed, she ran for the blue-haired doctor...she 
was so close...
 
Ami shrieked, the sound echoing along the walls of the empty hallway...
 
=====================
 
Rei was walking into the hospital when she heard the scream. She bit 
down a curse, and headed in the direction of the noise, thanking 
whatever had possessed her to bring her gun. &quot;First freaky women talking 
about vampires, then seemingly stable doctors screaming about zombies. 
What a night...&quot;
 
=====================
 
Even with the dog, Minako knew that her Tenshi would not be safe in this 
particular area.
 
So she followed.
 
This particular area of Tokyo was notorious for thieves and 
muggers...and other things that most mortals were lucky not to see in 
the hours of daylight. Minako detected the faint whisper of fabric 
against the wind, and she frowned. Someone else was following the girl 
as well. Her Queen did not watch over ALL the vampires, and there were 
some rogue beasts lurking about the streets of Tokyo, waiting for poor 
innocent victims to prey on.
 
However, something told Minako that this was not a matter of some 
lower-level blood sucker. This was something...stronger.
 
She watched as the dog stopped dead in its tracks, and then growled low 
in the back of its throat, its white fur practically standing on end. 
She saw the girl stop, and tug on the dog&#146;s leash. &quot;Fenrir,&quot; she 
muttered, her soft, gentle voice taking on an annoyed edge, &quot;come on 
now, sweetie. Let&#146;s go home, ok?&quot; The dog did not budge, and Minako 
turned when she heard a growl, lower and fiercer-sounding than the 
dog&#146;s. The dog began to bark, snarling viciously, and trying in vain to 
escape from the leash. She watched as the young lady&#146;s face paled, and 
she heard the growl again, far louder than the first. Finally, a 
thing...something, not even Minako could detect, tore out of the 
shadows.
 
The girl screamed.
 
And Minako ran to save her...
 
===================
 
Mitsuki was very, very frightened. Her puppy, a gift from her friend, 
was acting as if it was about to attack anything on sight, and then she 
saw something.
 
Something big.
 
It was far to large to be a dog, and it resembled a large wolf. The 
creature had matted, dirty gray fur, and crimson eyes peeked out from a 
large, wolf-like snout. It stood on two legs, but nothing else about it 
resembled anything vaguely human.
 
So Mitsuki screamed, and then she saw something else run out of the 
shadows. The girl, at least she was HOPING it was a girl, ran in front 
of her. She wore a long, black trench coat, a black turtleneck, and 
black jeans and boots. She had long, flowing blonde hair, tied back in a 
ponytail by a black, silk bow. She turned to Mitsuki, and bowed 
politely, ignoring the creature behind her. &quot;My name is Minako. And 
that,&quot; she pointed to the beast, &quot;is what we call a werewolf. If I 
may..&quot; she smiled weakly, &quot;can I have your name?&quot; Mitsuki blinked. 
&quot;Um...I...my name is Mitsuki...&quot; Minako smiled, trying to keep her grin 
from taking over her face. &quot;Good, good. Now,&quot; she stopped talking when 
she heard the werewolf howl.
 
&quot;Oh, keep your shirt on!&quot; She winked at Mitsuki. &quot;Minako to the rescue! 
I&#146;ll take this big jerk down in no time! Now you step back, alright?&quot; 
Mitsuki gawked at her. &quot;Are you crazy? We have to run!&quot; Minako scoffed. 
&quot;No need for that. But I do suggest you leave here as soon as possible. 
It might be dangerous.&quot; Mitsuki blinked. &quot;Um...you&#146;re insane.&quot; Before 
Minako had a chance to respond, the beast howled, and lunged for her. 
Minako easily side-stepped out of the way, but she was quickly knocked 
backwards by one of the creatures&#146; large fists. The monster then 
advanced on Mitsuki, but Fenrir leapt onto the beast&#146;s neck, digging his 
teeth into the large creature. The werewolf howled in pain, and 
desperately tried to get the dog off of his neck, thrashing about 
wildly. Minako, in the meanwhile, had regained her equilibrium, glaring 
at the beast. With vampiric speed, she ran for the creature, hoping to 
make quick work of it. The werewolf flung Fenrir of its neck, and swiped 
Minako against her stomach with its large, jagged claws. Barely aware of 
the pain, she punched the beast in the gut, sending it sprawling 
backwards. She then proceeded to give the beast a sound thrashing, and 
would&#146;ve made short work of it by sucking its blood if Mitsuki had not 
been there. When she was done however, the beast scampered off again 
into the shadows, and Minako stumbled unsteadily on her feet. Contrary 
to popular belief, vampires DID have blood of their own, and she had 
lost quite a bit due to the wound. Her head was spinning, and she heard 
Mitsuki gasp before she passed out...
 
===================
 
Rei was dreaming. She had to have been. Because if she wasn&#146;t dreaming, 
then there would be no way to properly describe the fact that the very 
dead Makoto Kino seemed very alive, albeit a bit pale. This Makoto had 
snarled at her however, and after the good doctor had gotten somewhere 
safe, she then proceeded to pump lead into whatever the thing was, 
ignore Ami&#146;s cries of protest. Destroying scientific history in the 
making or not, Rei knew that whatever this was had to be dangerous. But 
to her surprise, the thing seemed unfazed.
 
And then, like magic(and Rei would hit herself later for thinking of 
something so inane), two women appeared out of the shadows.
 
They both grabbed Makoto, who seemed to recognize them, because she 
struggled vainly against their grip. The taller one, a woman with 
sandy-blonde hair winked at Ami, who blanched and hid behind Rei. The 
shorter one, a woman with wavy, sea-green hair rolled her eyes.
 
The taller young woman turned to Ami and grinned. &quot;We&#146;ll be coming back 
for you.&quot;
 
The shorter one turned to Rei and smirked. &quot;Do you believe in vampires 
now?&quot; she asked.
 
Before Rei could respond, they both disappeared.
 
And Rei simply knew that Usagi would visit her later...but this time, 
she would follow...
 
===================
 
Minako groaned and opened her eyes, hearing the clatter of dishes. Soon 
after she heard a bark, followed by a muffled curse. That&#146;s when she 
realized she was in a bed.
 
Mitsuki&#146;s bed.

In Mitsuki&#146;s apartment.
 
She tried to get up, and immediately fell back down, clutching her 
stomach. She felt gauze, and smiled a little. She must have tended to my 
wounds...how sweet...however, this isn&#146;t exactly how I imagined ending 
up in her bed. She decided she&#146;d wait for Mitsuki to check on her, 
considering the fact she couldn&#146;t move. As if on cue, Mitsuki popped her 
head into the bed room and smiled brightly. She walked over and sat down 
on the bed, gently brushing a strand of hair away from Minako&#146;s face. 
&quot;You&#146;re awake. How are you feeling?&quot; Minako fought the urge to tackle 
the girl and rip off her clothes right there. &quot;I&#146;m...fine. You saved me, 
heh...thanks! You&#146;re a real angel.&quot; Mitsuki laughed a little bit, 
emerald eyes sparkling brightly. &quot;Well, you saved me first...so I guess 
we&#146;re even, huh?&quot; Minako grinned. &quot;Yes...even...but, it was a pleasure 
to save someone like you.&quot; Mitsuki chuckled a bit nervously, twirling 
her fingers in her hair. &quot;Um...would you like to stay tonight? I&#146;ll 
sleep on the couch, since you can&#146;t get up. It&#146;s very late, and I 
wouldn&#146;t want you going home in your condition.&quot; Minako sighed, inwardly 
blessing her good luck. &quot;I&#146;d love to...but, I&#146;ll be gone before 
sunrise.&quot; Mitsuki gasped. &quot;But....you can&#146;t! You aren&#146;t even healed 
yet!&quot; Minako chuckled wryly, and put her finger to Mitsuki&#146;s lips.
 
&quot;Don&#146;t worry. I&#146;m a fast healer...&quot;
 
===================
 
As Rei had predicted, Usagi did come to visit her in her office a little 
after midnight. The blonde seemed more agitated than usual, and she sat 
down in front of Rei, her expression somewhere in between annoyance and 
thoughtfulness. Rei wasted no time.
 
&quot;I have questions for you.&quot;

Usagi gave her a small, sweet smile, and handed the detective a small 
piece of paper. &quot;If you go to that address...you&#146;ll find me. Come after 
dark, and ask for me. The girls will lead you to my chamber. I&#146;ll answer 
everything there.&quot;
 
Rei shuffled a bit in her seat, and decided to ask Usagi a question. &quot;If 
it had been...anyone else...on this case I mean, they wouldn&#146;t be 
invited, would they?&quot;
 
Usagi smiled, shaking her head. &quot;Only you. You are special...and I want 
to find out as much about you as you do about me.&quot;
 
Rei lowered her head for a moment. &quot;I see...&quot; When she looked up again, 
Usagi was nowhere to be found.

&quot;I hate my job...&quot;
