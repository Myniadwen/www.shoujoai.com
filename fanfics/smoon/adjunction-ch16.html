<p>“<em>Minako-chan!  Rei-chan! What a surprise! You decided to have dinner here after  all?”</em></p>
<p><em>Minako nodded  to her manager, smiling with the innocence that her fans adored. She  turned to her eccentric manager's companion and tilted her head. “I  don't believe we've met. You are...?”</em></p>
<p><em>The woman had  been watching Rei's frozen expression with amusement, but at the  address turned her attention to the idol. She bowed her head with a  soft smile.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Kisekino Eika, at your  service, Aino-san. I'm sorry to have not met your acquaintance  before, but it's a pleasure to do so now. You see, your manager here  is actually my uncle, Saitou Sugao.”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei stared. </em>You can't be serious.</p>
<p>Minako looked  between the two. Rei looked far more shocked than she had when she'd  seen her pass photo, yet this time it was for a stranger. Minako  tilted her head in wonder. “Rei-chan? Do you know her?”</p>
<p>Before  Rei could say anything, Eika smoothly answered for her. “We bumped  into each other this afternoon, actually. I'd ruined some of  her perishables, so I had insisted on repaying her for them... Hino  Rei-san, wasn't it?”</p>
<p>Rei met her gaze,  startled. <em>You'll keep it a secret?</em></p>
<p>Eika winked so  quickly, it was doubtful that anyone else but the trained priestess  saw it. <em>I promised, didn't I?</em></p>
<p>Reassured, Rei fell  into line, smiling a little. “Ah... sorry, I just spaced out for a  moment. That's right. It almost seems like too much of a coincidence  that we meet again in the same day... under these circumstances no  less...” She bowed her head.</p>
<p>Sugao, not noticing  the curious tension from his charge, clapped his hands and declared,  “Well now, well now! After <em>that</em> we most certainly can't have  it any other way, now can we? Waiter! Move us to a bigger table!”  In a softer voice he smiled at his niece. “You don't mind, do you,  Eika-chan?”</p>
<p>Eika smiled and  shook her head. “Not at all, Uncle.”</p>
<p>Once the move had  been made, the seating arrangement around the round table let it be  so that Rei sat between Minako and Eika, with Sugao sitting across  from her. This, of course, made Rei increasingly nervous as the night  wore on.</p>
<p>Sugao was ranting  about how he was finally in town again after staying overseas with  Minako-chan, and when he had contacted Eika-chan, she had been busy  over the weekend, which was a shame, but now they could all have  dinner together and catch up.</p>
<p>Rei watched Eika in  wonder, trying to see the resemblance between them. If Sugao was a  firecracker (of the cannon shot blasted into the sky sort), Eika was  a sparkler in comparison (noticeable, and nice, but far quieter).</p>
<p>Eika switched her  generic smile over to Rei as Sugao wound down. “Yes, and much there  is to catch up on. But I wouldn't want to bore our idol and priestess  now.”</p>
<p>Minako shook her  head with a smile, the epitome of polite sincerity. She sipped from  her drink, their orders having already been placed in between Sugao's  miniature tirade.</p>
<p>“Not at all. If you don't mind us  listening, go ahead and talk as you will. What do you do for a  living, Kisekino-san?”</p>
<p>Eika shook her  head. “Please, call me Eika, Minako-san. Sugao talks so much about  you on the rare times our schedules match up for a phone call, I feel  like I know you already. As for your question... I own a jewelry  store downtown. Kiseki Jewels. Have you heard of it, by chance? I  wouldn't be surprised if you didn't, it's fairly small.”</p>
<p>Minako put some  thought into it before it rang a bell. “Ah... Usagi-chan mentioned  it a few times, I think. Ah, Usagi is a friend of mine and Rei's. Her  friend Naru's mother is in the jewelry business as well, and they  were so surprised when a new competitor started taking a great  majority of their clients... Eh? Wait a minute.”</p>
<p>Eika smiled  knowingly, like Rei had seen so many times in that single hour she'd  spent with the woman. Rei kept quiet.</p>
<p>Minako continued,  “You <em>own</em> that place! Have you always owned it or did you  recently come into it? Because even though it's fairly new in most  respects- popularity wise anyway- it opened nearly six years ago, and  you don't look like you...” The idol paused, realizing the polite  air had dropped, “Ah, I'm sorry.”</p>
<p>Eika shook her  head. “Don't be. I get that a lot. Yes, I was the owner when the  store received its first noticeable spike in ratings. It's a pity  but, even though I was young coming into the industry, now I'm a  bit...”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” Sugao leaned over and  rubbed cheeks with Eika, who took it with an indulgent smile. “If  Eika-chan starts saying she's old- which she isn't! What'll that say  about me?”</p>
<p>As Minako and Eika  laughed lightly at that, Rei continued to stare at them all in somber  silence. <em>So how old </em>is <em>she?</em></p>
<p>“Hino-san,” Rei bolted upright as  Eika called her name. “How is your shrine doing?”</p>
<p>Rei looked away.  “Fine,” she muttered.</p>
<p>Minako watched Rei,  curious at her stoic behavior, but eventually summed it up to being  shy around new faces. Or faces that annoyed her (as she had once  mentioned concerning her manager). So she let it go, especially as  the food arrived.</p>
<p>Rei had been only  half-heartedly listening to the conversation which involved talk of  the time overseas when it had somehow turned to Eika again.</p>
<p>Sugao patted Eika's  shoulder comfortingly as he related, “Seven years ago, Eika's  parents died in an accident while they were overseas in America, too,  don't you know. I'd intended to take her under my wing, but just a  year later...”</p>
<p>Eika smiled, a  little softer than she had been. “It's all right, really.”</p>
<p>Minako started,  “I... I'm sorry to hear that... about your parents I mean.”</p>
<p>Eika shook her  head. “I'm past it. The jewelry store was my mother's idea from the  start. But she had only managed to get it kicked off the floor when  it happened. Actually, she was on a business trip regarding it, at  the time.”</p>
<p>Sugao suddenly took  Eika into an exaggerated embrace and looked as if he was ready to cry  dramatic anime waterfalls of tears. “And this poor little girl had  to face the world alone! I was the only family she had left...!”</p>
<p>Eika smiled a  little. “Now really, Uncle. You make it seem as if I was on my way  to the orphanage. I may have rushed a few years of University, but I <em>did</em> graduate before taking up the store. And Rinka's been with  me the whole time, too.”</p>
<p><em>That name sounds  familiar... </em>Rei finally spoke up, “Who's Rinka?”</p>
<p>Eika glanced over  and smiled at hearing her speak again at last. “Rinka is my partner  at the store. On our business cards, it says I'm the owner, but  really, it's her that my mom left the store to. Before she knew I had  any interest in it. I learned quick though, so it worked out alright.  Ah, Rinka also rooms with me. No, I should say that I stay at her  apartment and pay my share of the rent. We-”</p>
<p>Sugao interrupted,  “Her own home sold! Her memories sold! Oh, you poor, poor, girl.”</p>
<p>Eika rolled her  eyes exasperated. “Uncle! I told you, it's not like that!  Minako-san, Hino-san, I apologize if I might have in any way spoiled  your evening with my past, ah Uncle, your tie!” Eika stopped to  whip Sugao's tie from out of the range of the sauce the remains of  her steak had been in. “Really now, be careful! And what are you  doing worrying about me when you've barely touched your food? Go on,  get to eating!”</p>
<p>Rei couldn't help  but smile, seeing this side of Eika. Not that she hadn't suspected it  was there but... she let out a breath of a laugh at Sugao's sulking  pout, separating himself from his niece to obey her insistence.</p>
<p>Eika absently  fluffed her shirt out as if to prevent wrinkling, and continued,  “Before you leave thinking that Uncle is doing anything aside from  exaggerating, let me also say that I had a sound inheritance to fall  back on, and more than enough emotional support. True, the first few  years were a little hard to get used to, but I'm perfectly fine now.  Really.”</p>
<p>Minako sighed  softly, smiling into her drink. “If you say so, Eika-san, I'll take  your word for it. Did you have any other plans for tonight?”</p>
<p>Eika shook her  head. “Not yet. I'm a spur of the moment type planner. Why do you  ask?”</p>
<p>Minako looked to  Rei, as if she were gathering the materials before wreaking havoc on  the kitchen. “What about you, Rei-chan? Were you going to do  anything?”</p>
<p>Rei hesitated,  having a sense of where this was going. “Sleep would be nice... but  I don't suspect I'll get any better rest tonight than the last few  nights anyway.”</p>
<p>Minako blinked,  startled. “You have trouble sleeping? Why didn't you say  something?”</p>
<p>Rei rolled her  eyes. “We stayed up late with the others last night with that  little welcoming party, and we were talking a while longer than I  thought the night before that. I'm not an insomniac or anything. I'll  be fine if I just go home.”</p>
<p>Minako seemed a bit  disappointed at this. But, making up her mind, she looked between  Eika and Rei and asked, “In that case... what if you sleep here?  The beds are really nice, and my room is closer than the shrine after  all.”</p>
<p>Rei held back her  flinch, but she was still irked. She was about to use the brats as an  excuse, but they didn't come until after school so that was a bit  off. And it's not like Minako didn't have comfortable bedding. But...</p>
<p>Eika held her hands  up in soft protest. “Oh, that's too much, Minako-san, we've only  just met after all.”</p>
<p>Minako shook her  head vigorously. “Anyone who is a relative of Sugao-manager is like  family to me. Extended family. And if you don't mind, I'd like to get  to know you better as well.”</p>
<p>Eika still  hesitated, looking to Rei. She was aware that she made the priestess  uncomfortable, and though the girl had rarely spoken, Eika already  knew enough to know that she didn't want to impose. Especially not if  Rei accepted.</p>
<p>Rei shifted in her  seat, ignoring the boisterous claims Sugao made of what a great idea  letting Eika-chan and Rei-chan stay over was.</p>
<p>Somehow, Rei <em>knew</em> that tonight's plans would be decided by her.</p>
<p>That didn't really  help her decide.</p>
<p>Rei stood up. “I  um. Need to use the restroom. Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Rei-chan!”</p>
<p>But Rei had already  left the table.</p>
<p>-.-.-</p>
<p>Rei sighed as she  splashed water over her face, glad she wasn't really a fan of  make-up. This was just too much... It was only this morning that she  had met this woman, who caught her looking through her shop's window. <em>Do owners usually greet customers outside their shop like that?</em></p>
<p>It was only this  afternoon that she had spoken in depth to this woman, about her love  interest. <em>What in the name of Kami-sama had possessed her to do  that anyway?</em></p>
<p>It was only an hour  or so ago when she had learned that this woman was in a way connected  to said love interest. <em>How was I to guess that she and that idiot  manager were related?</em></p>
<p>She had only just  had dinner with both this woman and this love interest.</p>
<p>And now love  interest was inviting both her and the woman-who-knew-her-secret to  spend the night.</p>
<p>Rei fell forward,  hitting the mirror with a soft thud. <em>Why am I so bothered by this?  It's a small world... a coincidence... so why...?</em></p>
<p>“You're in love with her, aren't  you?” A soft whisper teased her ear.</p>
<p>Rei bolted so  quickly around, her feet slipped, tripping the feet of the one who  had sneaked up on her.</p>
<p>Rei stared up, up  at those eyes which had captivated her so. It only just occurred to  her, in the back of her mind, that perhaps hours before, she was  pinning Minako in much the same way she was now being pinned.</p>
<p>The woman she had  just been thinking about smiled down at her. “You have good taste,  Hino-chan. Case Advice No. 1: If you get the chance, don't be afraid  to take it.”</p>
<p>And then, Eika did  what Rei could never have done with Minako. Or rather, <em>had</em> never done.</p>
<p>She bent down and  closed the distance between them.</p>
<p>Rei was certain  that her heart would cease to beat altogether.</p>
<p><em>Minako...</em></p>
<p>-.-.-</p>
<p>“They've been gone awhile, haven't  they?” Minako murmured.</p>
<p>Sugao had already  taken care of the bill, and with dessert already had, all that was  left was to wait. Minako started to get up. “Should I check on  them?”</p>
<p>“Minako-chan,” the call stopped the  idol in her tracks. She looked questioningly at her manager. “Be  careful around Eika-chan, won't you?”</p>
<p>Sugao had lost much  of his eccentricity so quickly that Minako was startled. She sat back  down. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Sugao looked to the  restroom door, before answering in a low tone, as if afraid he would  be overheard. “She has a reputation... a very well hidden one, but  a reputation nonetheless.”</p>
<p>Minako narrowed her  eyebrows. “What are you talking about? I don't-”</p>
<p>“Everyone who falls in love with her  ends up with their heart broken. In more ways than one.”</p>
<p>Minako didn't get  what this had to do with her, and said as much. “<em>I'm</em> not in  love with her- though I <em>am</em> getting to like her as a person- so  why are you telling me this?”</p>
<p>Sugao chirruped,  trying to regain that energetic charge again, “Oh, it's probably  nothing. Forget I said anything, Minako-chan. You should be safe  enough.”</p>
<p>Minako frowned.  Sugao offered no other information. Shaking her head, she stood up  and headed to the restroom.</p>
<p>Sugao sighed. Once  she was out of earshot, he murmured, “Save Eika, Minako-chan.  Please, please find a way to help her.”</p>
<p>Minako was  surprised by how sparse the restroom line was, considering the hour.  Empty in fact. But perhaps since the roof restaurant was only used  for VIPs and company, and there weren't any others staying at the  hotel at the moment, therein lay the reason.</p>
<p>The restroom was  small, only one big stall, apparently. Minako tried the knob, and  found it locked. She was about to knock, when she heard the muffled  voices.</p>
<p>“<em>Y-you... you shouldn't do things  like that.”</em> Rei's voice?</p>
<p>“<em>Oh? Did I scare you, Hino-chan?  My apologies then.”</em> And Eika?</p>
<p>“<em>... Let me go.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>But I'm not done yet. You see, I  also have to tell you...” </em>She must have started whispering,  because Minako couldn't make out any of her words.</p>
<p>“<em>W-what are you talking about? I  wouldn't... Not ever... ahh... stop it... that hurt...”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You can do this too you know...  are you that afraid?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Can you blame me? It's like you  read my mind and always arrive one step ahead of me...”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I've heard stories of your power.  You've never met anyone like you?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Kami-sama... nggh...”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Favors and ignores at will. But  mine is a gift of practice, not of divination.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>It isn't... I said stop th-that!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Do you have a pledge of celibacy,  Hino-chan?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>What are you talking about? Stop  it, Minako and your uncle are waiting for us.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I'm not worried. Is it yes, or is  it no? I will treat you accordingly depending on your answer.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>... 'Accordingly' how?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You'll know once you answer. Does  your position as priestess hold you to the shrine and the shrine  alone?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>What... ah, okay, okay, I'll  answer! I... I've completed my training. I don't need to stay at the  shrine, not officially. I was supposed to leave it two years ago  anyway. But I'll wait until I'm sure someone competent has taken over  care for the shrine...”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Is there trouble?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Well... there was... augh, why am  I telling you this anyway? It doesn't concern you!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Because you know you want someone  to hear you... but you're even more afraid to tell anyone else. And  because you know I care to know.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>... We should really get going.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Not yet. You still haven't  answered my question.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I did! I said-”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I didn't ask if you needed to </em>stay <em>at the shrine. I asked if connection to the shrine keeps  you from enjoying bodily pleasures, especially before marriage.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>That... that... why do you want  to know that anyway!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Hi-no-cha-n. Just answer, won't  you?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>... Only because I want to.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>But if you want to, you're  allowed to?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>...Mm.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Good girl. Thank you. Let's leave  before we start to smell like this place, no?”</em></p>
<p>Minako took a step  back, and then another. She quickly turned tail and ran- no- walked  very quickly to the elevator, right past Sugao.</p>
<p>Her manager sighed  hopelessly. “Rei is your target this time then? Your technique must  have gotten harsher since I last heard, to cause Minako-chan to  flee...”</p>
<p>-.-.-</p>
<p>Rei grumbled softly  as Eika finally got to her feet and helped her up as well. After that  first peck on the cheek, Eika had gone from whispering  “simplicity-is-sweet advice” to nibbling on her ear. Not to  mention the questions... it was a very weird way of getting  information out of her to help her situation with Minako, even if  that was how Eika explained it.</p>
<p>Just before they  went to the door, Eika touched her wrist, bidding her to stop, before  planting another kiss on her cheek. “That's for being a good sport,  Hino-chan.”</p>
<p>“I've decided,” Rei whispered,  opening the door, which she had realized should have been locked  behind her. <em>How did she get in?</em></p>
<p>“Decided what?” Eika innocently  humored.</p>
<p>“I found out what bugged me about  you.” Rei didn't look at her as she exited the restroom. “You  are, in fact, more eccentric than your uncle. Just in a very  different direction.”</p>
<p>Eika laughed.  “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Rei muttered in  return, “I wasn't complimenting you.”</p>
