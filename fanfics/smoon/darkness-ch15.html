<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Once Amara and Michelle left the room, their smiles soon dissipated. 
They looked at each other silently and made their way down the hallway 
as Amara growled under her breathe in anger.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe someone would do that!&quot;, raged Amara as she looked 
down at the floor. Michelle sighed as she too was pretty pissed off.

&quot;We&#39;re vampires and they&#39;re slayers. It&#39;s the slayers duty to kill 
us.&quot;, replied Michelle. Amara snapped a dangerous look towards 
Michelle.

&quot;But they are children. Those two could have died if Serena hadn&#39;t 
lost her temper.&quot;, exclaimed Amara Michelle looked towards her lover 
and sighed again.

&quot;I know.&quot;, she replied quietly. Amara looked at Michelle for a moment 
and then slung an arm around the woman&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go out for a little hunt to take our minds off 
things.&quot;, said Amara as her eyes flashed green. Michelle smirk as her 
eyes flashed green as well.

&quot;I&#39;m game.&quot;, she remarked. The two women continued down the hallway 
and soon out the front door to go on a much-needed hunt.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Rini and Hotaru left the den after the encounter with Serena and Rei. 
The two girls were left a little shaken up as they walked down the 
quiet hallways of the large house.

When they reached their room they both walked inside as Hotaru sat in 
a beanbag chair and Rini sat on her bed.

They both sat in a daze, lost in their own thoughts. Hotaru being the 
first to recover looked over towards Rini and then over to their Play 
station 2.

&quot;Yo Rini. Want to play?&quot;, asked Hotaru as she moved towards the game 
and television. Rini looked up and smiled slightly. She nodded her 
head and went over to the beanbag Hotaru was sitting in. With Hotaru 
being busy with setting up the game, she didn&#39;t notice someone already 
sitting in her seat.

Once Hotaru was done, she leaned back to sit down. Instead of finding 
the seat she found herself sitting on top of a lap. A lap which 
belonged to Rini.

Hotaru blushed slightly and tried to get up. She was held back when 
Rini quickly wrapped her arms around her waist to hold her still.

She turned her head towards Rini who held an innocent look and was 
looking towards the television. Hotaru sighed and sat back to get 
comfortable. Rini&#39;s hold around Hotaru&#39;s waist went tighter and the 
girls presumed their attention towards the game.

Rini rested her chin on Hotaru&#39;s shoulder and sighed quietly to 
herself. Hotaru shifted a little uncomfortably with Rini being so 
close.

She took a side-wards glance at Rini and sworn she saw the girl 
laughing at her. Hotaru sat herself more comfortably in Rini&#39;s lap and 
began to play the game.

Everyone now and than, Rini would nuzzle her face into Hotaru&#39;s neck 
or softly blow into the girl&#39;s ear. Hotaru would move slightly as her 
breath would come slightly uneven.

A few minutes later Hotaru change the two player game and switched to 
something that was a one player, considering that Rini didn&#39;t want to 
play anymore.

Soon Hotaru was locked into the game which made Rini slightly happy. 
Rini nuzzled her face into Hotaru&#39;s neck and with one hand moved 
around on Hotaru&#39;s belly. She slightly frowned when Hotaru didn&#39;t 
acknowledge the gesture.

Rini smirked as she dipped her hand down a little further which made 
Hotaru snap her head towards her direction. Hotaru stared with her 
eyes wide from what Rini had just done. Rini slightly smiled at 
Hotaru&#39;s flabbergasted expression.

&quot;Rini! What are you doing?&quot;, exclaimed Hotaru.

&quot;My hand slipped.&quot;, remarked Rini. Hotaru&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly as 
she looked upon her pink haired friend.

&quot;That was no accident.&quot;, Said Hotaru. Rini smiled in amusement with 
Hotaru&#39;s reaction, but to Hotaru she didn&#39;t see anything that sparked 
any amusement.

&quot;What is so funny.&quot;, Remarked Hotaru while gritting her teeth.

&quot;Your just so cute when your mad.&quot;, Said Rini with a grin. Hotaru&#39;s 
eyes widened slightly as she stared at Rini.

&quot;W-w-what?!?!&quot;, Replied Hotaru meekly. Rini&#39;s smile grew even wider as 
she inched her face closer to Hotaru&#39;s face.

&quot;I said that you&#39;re cute when your mad.&quot;, Said Rini as she went even 
closer to Hotaru&#39;s face. Their noses were touching at the tip as they 
could feel their warm breathes brush against their slightly parted 
lips.

Hotaru licked her lips and accidentally brushed her tongue across 
Rini&#39;s lips. Hotaru froze in place as she realized what she had done 
and stared into Rini&#39;s large red eyes. Rini had gasped slightly and 
dipped down and brushed her lips against Hotaru&#39;s lips.

Rini sat back on the beanbag which caused Hotaru to be practically to 
be laying on top of Rini. Hotaru wrapped her arms around Rini&#39;s neck 
as Rini wrapped her arms around Hotaru&#39;s waist.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setsuna was in the shadows quietly listening to Amara and Michelle&#39;s 
conversation. The woman smiled slightly and walked to Serena and Rei&#39;s 
room.

She slightly cracked open the door and peeked inside. She saw the two 
young girls cuddling in their sleep. Setsuna walked in the room and 
over towards the bed. She ran her hand through Serena&#39;s bangs and down 
her cheek softly.

Serena smiled slightly and nuzzled her face into Rei&#39;s neck. Setsuna 
smiled again and took a glimpse at Serena&#39;s necklace. She lifted up 
the pendent and examined it for a few seconds.

&#39;You are a very strong vampire. No child has ever taken down two 
slayers before.&#39;, whispered Setsuna while looking over the 
well-bruised girl.

&quot;I see something great in you.&quot;, finished off Setsuna. She let go of 
the pendent and walked out of the room and quietly closed the door 
behind her. She walked down the hall and went to Rini and Hotaru&#39;s 
room.

She crept open the door and looked around the room. She slightly 
blushed when she saw the two girls sitting on a beanbag chair having a 
huge make- out contest.

&#39;Well those two are close.&#39; Thought Setsuna as she closed the door 
behind her.

&quot;Let me go tell Amy, Molly and Melvin about the rooming plans.&quot;, said 
Setsuna to herself. She began her walk down the long hallway yet 
again.

Once she made it to the large den, she saw Amy looking at a book or 
more likely staring off into space while holding up a book to her 
face. Molly and Melvin were sitting on a large couch sleeping 
peacefully. Setsuna sighed quietly.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell them later.&quot;, she whispered as she walked away from the den 
and towards her bedroom.

&quot;I need a long bubble bath.&quot;, she mumbled to herself as she walked 
into her bedroom and shut the door behind her.



Serena shifted in her sleep and opened up her eyes wearily. She tried 
to sit up only to have pain run through her body. Serena moaned 
slightly and lied back down .

Serena moved her eyes up and looked at Rei who was still sleeping. She 
smiled slight as she felt Rei tighten her grip around Serena&#39;s waist.

Serena lifted a hand and caressed Rei&#39;s bruised cheek . Serena put up 
a devious smile as she brought her hand to Rei&#39;s nose. Serena plugged 
Rei&#39;s nose to block off Rei&#39;s breathing.

Rei&#39; twitched slightly before her eyes shot wide open. Serena let go 
of Rei&#39;s nose and erupted into a fit of laughter. Rei gasped fore air 
and looked down at Serena in anger.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t funny.&quot;, she yelled which made Serena laugh even harder. 
Tears started to run down Serena&#39;s cheeks as she couldn&#39;t stop 
laughing. Rei glared down at her girlfriend and raised a hand.

She brought it down and smacked Serena on the back. Serena stopped 
laughing as her mouth went wide along with her eyes. Serena screamed 
out in pain that she wasn&#39;t expecting to be inflicted on her. Tears of 
pain welled in her eyes that she desperately tried to hold back.

She buried her face into Rei&#39;s neck as the tears poured down. Rei 
looked down at Serena and her anger turn to a look of apology. Rei 
gently wrapped her arms around Serena&#39;s trembling body and put her 
chin on top of her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Serena, I didn&#39;t mean it.&quot;, exclaimed Rei trying to get her 
lover to top crying. Rei had tears of her own burning in her eyes as 
she slowly rocked Serena from side to side. Serena sniffled as her 
tears slowly diminished She quietly listened to Rei&#39;s heartbeat as Rei 
continued to rock her.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Rei.&quot;, whispered Serena as she lightly kissed on Rei&#39;s 
neck. Rei smiled in delight and she kissed Serena on the forehead. 
Serena giggled softly and snuggled into Rei&#39;s arm&#39;s comfortably.

&quot;Where do you think everyone is?&quot;, asked Serena. Rei sighed softly 
before replying.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. If I know Amara-papa and Michelle-mama well, than 
they&#39;re probably out on a hunt. To clear their minds off things.&quot;, 
replied Rei.

&quot;I&#39;m hungry.&quot;, remarked Serena as she sat up slowly.

&quot;But you ate already.&quot;

&quot;So, I&#39;m still hungry.&quot;,whined Serena as Rei rolled her eyes.

&quot;Come on and let&#39;s get something to eat.&quot;,Said Rei.

&quot;You mean right now?&quot;, Asked Serena.

&quot;Um, yeah!&quot;,Exclaimed Rei. Serena&#39;s mouth went agape as she looked up 
at Rei.

&quot;But, I don&#39;t want to get up.&quot;, Said Serena.

&quot;Than how are we going to get food!&quot;, Yelled Rei enthusiastically. 
Serena groan because she had to move from a very comfortable spot.

Serena and got themselves painfully to their feet and were leaning on 
each other for support. They both walked out of the room and down the 
hallway. They stopped by Rini and Hotaru&#39;s room and quietly peeked 
inside.

Their eyes widened amazingly wide at the two girls trying to suck each 
other&#39;s faces off. The two injured vamps shot away from the door and 
stared a each other with bewildered expressions.

&quot;Wow!&quot;, Exclaimed Rei with wide eyes.

&quot;Your sister and Rini are like... kissing!&quot;, Shrieked Serena.

&quot;Come on and let&#39;s leave them alone.&quot;, Said Rei as the two girls 
continued their journey down the hall and to the kitchen.

&quot;AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH..&quot;, screamed Rei and Serena as they felt someone 
grab onto their shoulders, They girls turned their heads around to 
find a laughing Setsuna.

&quot;You know Setsuna, you really have to stop doing that.&quot;, exclaimed 
Serena with a mock glare. Setsuna quieted down her laughter and 
replaced it with a warm smile.

&quot;What are you two doing out of bed?&quot;, questioned Setsuna.

&quot;Um, I&#39;m hungry.&quot;, replied Serena. Setsuna smiled and picked up the 
two girls in both of her arms.

&quot;Come on, I&#39;ll fix you something.&quot; , replied Setsuna as she brought 
the girls down to the kitchen. She set the girls at the kitchen table 
as she went into the fridge and brought out some packets of blood. She 
turned around and looked over towards the two girls.

&quot;Do you want it cold or warm?&quot;, asked Setsuna.

&quot;Warm!&quot;, exclaimed Serena as she licked her lips while her large eyes 
turned green.

&quot;Alright.&quot;, said Setsuna as she warmed up the blood and poured it into 
three large mugs. She brought the mugs over to the table and seated 
herself across from the two girls. She handed them each a mug as she 
took one herself.

&quot;I don&#39;t want any!&quot;, exclaimed Rei with a grimace expression.

&#39;You need it for strength, so drink up.&quot;, said Setsuna sternly. Rei 
pouted as she brought the mug to her lips and slowly drunk the warm 
red liquid down. Serena on the other hand snatch up the mug and drunk 
it down in two large gulps.

&quot;So how do you girls feel?&quot;, asked Setsuna tenderly. Serena put her 
mug down and licked her lips as she looked up at Setsuna.

&quot;I guess I&#39;m alright. I still hurt in places, but we&#39;re vampires. 
We&#39;ll probably fully healed in two days.&quot;, replied Serena as Rei 
nodded her head in agreement. They were interrupted from their 
conversation when Amara and Michelle entered the room with grim 
expressions.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;, asked Rei as Amara and Michelle sat at the kitchen 
table. Amara sighed heavily as she looked over towards the Setsuna and 
the three girls.

&quot;Well it seems that Serena here has made a name for herself.&quot;, said 
Amara as she ran a hand through her short bangs.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;,asked Serena.

&quot;What she means.&quot;, said Michelle. &quot;Is that word got out that you 
killed two slayers. All the vampires now you.

&quot;So that&#39;s a good thing.&quot;, replied Serena with a smile. Amara and 
Michelle shook their heads &#39;no&#39;.

&quot;No it&#39;s not.&quot;, said Michelle. Serena&#39;s face scrunched up in 
confusion.

&quot;Why no?&quot;, she asked.

&quot;Because it&#39;s going around through the slayers that a mere child 
killed two slayers. Their leader isn&#39;t pleased and they&#39;re looking for 
you..&quot; said Amara.

&quot;Who&#39;s their leader?&quot;, asked Rei.

&quot;Darien Chiba.&quot;
