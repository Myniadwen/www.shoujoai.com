<h2>Falling through the  Night</h2>
<p>Nabiki lazily trailed her finger down Tao-Ching’s chest  as she propped her head on the other hand and sighed.</p><p>
  “God’s, I’ve been wanting to do that all day.  Watching you and Ukyo this morning got me  really worked up.  I couldn’t decide  which of you I wanted to fuck more.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching laughed as he moved his hips under  hers.  “Well, considering where you’re  still sitting, I’d have to guess I won.”</p><p>
  Nabiki sighed softly as her eyes closed.  Then she chuckled as she looked at him  again.  “Actually, I think our little  Firebird is trying to get into Ukyo’s pants.   The look she was giving her during the fight was almost puppy love.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching grinned.   “That little priestess certainly does seem to stay close to her. I’d say  she’s trying to make herself a third with Zhu Shu and Ukyo. Too bad they’re so  young.”</p><p>
  Nabiki pushed herself up to her full arm extension,  her hips pressing down firmly.  “Why,  this bunnygirl not loli enough for you?” she asked as she tightened her grip.</p><p>
  Tao-Ching grinned.   “Of course you are.  And it’s not  like you would object to a orgy with two girls to play with.  You’re as much of a hentai as I am.”</p><p>
  “Damn straight.   However, I happen to respect my respect my sister’s property, even if  she is adopted, and currently needing to be rescued.  When Zhu Shu is freed from Naraku, and she can  give permission, then I might see if I can play.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching laughed.   “I’d be worried they would seduce you into their little group and I’d  never see you again.”</p><p>
  Nabiki licked her lips.  “Well, as much fun as spending a few days  tasting the ecstasies of pure feminine nectar might be, I happen to like what  I’m sitting on too much to give it up, or what it’s attached to.”</p><p>
  “Thank the gods for small favors.”</p><p>
  Nabiki squeezed.   “I would not call this ‘small’.”   She started a slow rhythm of tensing and releasing.  “So what do you make of this new thing with  Ukyo?”</p><p>
  “You mean being the reincarnation of Lady  Orihime?  I’m quite certain of it being  the truth.  My mom worships the legend of  her.  She’s the Dragon’s Guardian, and  the greatest master of the guan dao according to the Amazon histories, which I  can tell you are quite different than the ones you got taught.  Ask Lo Shen to show them to you  sometime.  And one of the central themes of  the Orihime legend is that she will be reborn to defend the Dragon when Lin Tzu  herself is reborn.  The Amazons are  absolutely sure that Zhu Shu is Lin Tzu reborn, so it only makes sense that  Orihime is here too.  That also explains  a few other things.”</p><p>
  Nabiki was breathing harder as she concentrated, her  head thrown back and her eyes closed.   “Like what?”</p><p>
  “Lin Tzu had almost a dozen wives, but there are four  primarily seen as her principle mates.   Lady Orihime, the Dragon’s Guardian.   Lady Ying-Ying, the Imperial Physician, Lady Ye-Ying, the Royal  Assassin, and Lady Phoenix, also known as Sailor Mars.” </p><p>
  Nabiki had cracked an eye.  “How can you manage to keep talking with me  doing this?”</p><p>
  “Amazon warriors are taught all kinds of concentration  tricks, Nabi-chan.  You can never tell  when some assassin might try to stick a knife in you.  Wait till we’re back in our time in my  bedroom if you want me to lose all control.”</p><p>
  She giggled.  “I  don’t think I can wait that long.  I’m  about to lose <em>my</em> mind.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching smiled and grabbed her hips to steady her as  he started bucking underneath her.  There  was no talking for a few minutes as Nabiki struggled to contain her moans, then  she felt him tense and she surrendered to her own ecstasy.</p><p>
  When she could think again, she leaned over him and  said, “So you are saying that Ukyo and Rei sniffing around one another is  because they used to be lovers in their past lives too?”</p><p>
  “Probably.”</p><p>
  “Where does that leave my sister then?  I know for a fact she’s in love with Zhu Shu  as much as with both of her fiancées.  Is  she a reincarnation too?”</p><p>
  “Who knows?  Lin  Tzu was known for winning people’s love.   The Amazons set aside two thousand years of independence to swear fealty  to the Dragon Empress out of nothing more than love of her, after all.  She could just be a new member of the fan  club.”</p><p>
  A long wail of heartrending despair shattered the  night.  Nabiki sat up like she’d been  shot.</p><p>
  “Oh my god, that was <em>Zhu Shu!</em>”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>They stood before the Mirror of Beruche’s soul and  shuddered.</p><p>
  Lo Shen had brought all four of them into the phantom  sister’s psyche and Konatsu and Ami had certainly been ill prepared for what  they saw there, despite the warnings given by Lo Shen and Ying-Ying.  Ami looked at the reflection of Beruche naked  and in chains, her skin covered by lash marks and burns, her face a mask of  longing and despair, and she turned away crying.</p><p>
  “Oh, how could anyone do that to someone!” the  distraught senshi cried.</p><p>
  Konatsu’s face just looked sad and bewildered.</p><p>
  Lo Shen grimaced.   “I wish more people could see the souls of those they hurt.  It might make for a kinder human race.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying nodded.   “I cannot even tell where to begin.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “I am not sure either.   Compulsions and dominations were never my strong suit like they were  Clove’s.  And she was never this  cruel.  She influenced, seduced, sometimes  forced, and could occasionally be pretty nasty in her own way, but she was  never this <em>brutal</em>.  I could use her skills.  I’d even be willing to let bygones be bygones  if she were willing to <em>prove</em> she was  trying to seek redemption.”  She turned  to look at the still silent figure of Konatsu.</p><p>
  For a long moment there was silence as Ami looked  between Lo Shen and Konatsu in confusion.   Then Konatsu sighed and shimmered.   As they watched, the ninja girl’s hair released itself from its bows,  shifting from midnight black to snow white, and her ears grew points as her red  gi reshaped itself into a tight black Mandarin dress.  Emerald green eyes gazed out of her  exotically beautiful face to meet Lo Shen’s lavender ones.</p><p>
  “I did not think you had sensed me, Lo Shen.  It seems I was wrong.” Clove said as she  crossed her arms and arched her eyebrow.   “Is this why you dragged Konatsu into this poor woman’s head?”</p><p>
  Ami gasped.   Ying-Ying laid a hand on her arm.   “It’s okay.  Please, trust me, and  don’t be alarmed.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen was nodding.   “You had me fooled completely, Clove, until I overheard you and  Ying-Ying talking.  I suspected you might  have left a geas in Konatsu, but not that you had possessed her.  Yet if Legend is willing to trust you, I  would be proving myself to be a stubborn, prejudiced old woman if I refused to  give you a chance.”  She indicated the chained  woman in the mirror.  “She is beyond my  skill.  I could eventually break the  spells binding her, but I don’t have the specialized knowledge to do so without  harming her greatly.  The Ginzishou could  possibly remake her, but it would strip from her much of who she is.  I would like to save her with as little  damage as possible.”</p><p>
  Clove shook her head, her long white hair floating  around her in a cloud.  “The fool who did  this to her is a vicious oaf.  I suspect  he’s male, and contemptuous of women.”   She reached out to touch the mirror.   “There is an echo here of great power, dedicated to destruction, like a  negative version of the crystal carried by the young moon princess.”</p><p>
  “An evil Silver Crystal?” Ami asked, shocked.</p><p>
  Clove nodded.  </p><p>
  “Are - are you really the one who’s out to kill Zhu  Shu?” Ami said hesitantly.  “You look  just like she used to.”</p><p>
  Clove sighed.   “I was brought back to life by the Queen of Demons to do so, yes.  I don’t think I will do so now, though, so  long as I am free to choose otherwise.  I  cannot really find it within myself to slay my elder sister.”</p><p>
  Ami blinked.   “S-sister?”</p><p>
  Clove closed her eyes and nodded.  “I did not understand before, blinded as I  was by the lies I was told.  But I have  stared into the Eyes of the Dragon, and I could not fail to see the truth  reflected within them.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen gave Ami a long look.  “I will not ask you to lie to your friends,  Ami Mizuno, but I ask that you keep this knowledge to yourself if you can.  Clove has done something I would have never  thought possible, and merged with Konatsu.   So long as she is residing in the ninja girl, she is most likely safe  from detection by Hild, just as she was safe from detection by me.  She is defying her bargain with the Demon  Queen, and so long as she continues to earn my trust, I would like to aid her  in this.”</p><p>
  “<em>So long as?</em>”  Clove asked snidely.</p><p>
  “I know most of your past sins were the blame of the  wizard Xi’an Chi, but not all, Clove.  Mu  was my friend, and I do not take kindly to your trying to poison her.” Lo Shen  said sharply.</p><p>
  Clove sighed.   “She was a <em>trap</em>, Lo Shen.  A honey baited trap, and you all fell for  her.  Xi’an Chi bred her for no other  purpose but to steal Shi’s heart and bear a Daughter of the Dragon.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen stepped back in shock. “What!”</p><p>
  “Yes.  The damn  wizard was promising me Shi with one hand, and taking him away with the other  through Mu.  She was just a brood mare he  created solely to bring out the Dragon’s Blood.   When I found out, I went a bit berserk, okay?  Yes, I tried like hell to kill her at  first.  But she was an utter innocent in  the entire affair.  She had no clue what  she was or that she had been made to be used.   And once Shi had married her and she was pregnant, it was too late  anyway.” Clove said morosely. “If Xi’an Chi hadn’t manipulated my father into  trying to marry me off to that damn Mongol butcher, Genghis whatever, and  pretty much forced me to kill Garlic only to have Clan Dragon declare war on me  as an Usurper, I would have been able to tell Shi that Mu had come to me and rather  ineptly tried to seduce me in an attempt to make peace between us.  I never had the chance to tell him I wished  to accept her request to take me as a Sister-Wife.”</p><p>
  “But, <em>Musk</em> declared war on Clan Dragon!” Lo Shen insisted.</p><p>
  Clove blinked.   “What?  <em>Why</em> would I declare war on the only <em>man</em> I loved?”</p><p>
  Lo Shen put her hands on her hips.  “To force him to marry you according to the  terms of declaration.”</p><p>
  Clove rolled her eyes.   “How stupid could you be Lo Shen?   No-one who knew Shi could possibly think that that would work!  Marry me or I will go to war with you?”  She put her face in her palm.  “By the gods, Xi’an Chi must have gotten to  the messengers and played us all for fools.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen paled.   “But, but the Musk launched a sneak attack on the Dragon stronghold…”  she said weakly.</p><p>
  “After they had attacked and burned our town, how were  we not to retaliate?” Clove threw her hands in the air in exasperation. “It wasn’t  until the battle was half over that I realized the fortress had been taken  utterly by surprise.  Then I found Shi  wiping out a pack of strangers wearing the livery of my personal guard, and I  realized Xi’an Chi must have hired mercenaries to start the war.  I tracked Shi to Jusenkyo, but before I could  get him to stop attacking me, Xi’an Chi showed up, and in order to save Shi,  Mu, and their daughter, I had to fight him.   And <em>lost.</em>  The bastard tortured and raped me before he  threw me into that pool and pinned me to the bottom with his staff.” Clove  finished, tears streaming down her cheeks silently.</p><p>
  Lo Shen turned to see Ying-Ying looking at her with  golden eyes, and she sighed.  “It seems  we were indeed all played for fools.”   She stepped forward to lay a hand on Clove’s shoulder.  “For my part, I am sorry for misjudging you.”</p><p>
  Clove sniffed and wiped her nose.  “I never understood why you and Ke Lun hated  me so much.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen sighed again, her bunny ears drooping.  “I don’t know, Clove.  In three hundred years I have thought about  those days over and over, and the only causes I have ever been able to find are  petty teenaged emotions.  I don’t know exactly  what Ke Lun’s reasons were, but mine were jealousy over your beauty and despair  that you never looked at me the way you looked at so many other girls.  I perhaps should have told you how badly I  desired you then, rather than allowing my shyness turn into resentment.”</p><p>
  Clove dried her cheeks on her sleeve.  “If you had looked back then the way you look  right now I wouldn’t have been able to keep my hands off you.  I never even knew you were interested.  All you seemed to care about was replacing me  as the masters favored apprentice.”   Clove sighed.  “And I admit I was  a bitch.  I was vain, and spoiled, and too  used to getting my own way through whatever means I had to use.  I hated that about my mother, yet I was just  like her.  I spent a small eternity at  the bottom of that pool realizing so many things I regretted.  Drowning is not something I ever want to do  again.  I was so angry that everyone I  had thought to call a friend had turned against me, and the only one I had to  be angry with was myself.”  She looked at  the soul mirror before them.  “I was like  this poor girl in so many-” she broke off suddenly as her eyes went wide.  “It couldn’t be…”</p><p>
  Lo Shen eyes narrowed as she looked at the dragon  mage. “What is it?”</p><p>
  Clove’s hand shot out, passing through the mirror and  seeming to go straight into the girl’s heart.   Black fire burned along her arm as she screamed, but forced her arm  deeper.  Lo Shen’s eyes widened and she  tried to pull the white haired girl back, only to be flung aside as dark  lightning crawled along Clove’s skin.  </p><p>
  “What is happening!” Ying-Ying shouted over the roar  of thunder.</p><p>
  “I don’t know!”   Lo Shen yelled back.</p><p>
  Then Clove screamed.   “I got you, you bastard!”</p><p>
  She strained to pull her arm back, placing a foot  against the mirror as she slowly withdrew inch by inch.  The girl in the mirror writhed, her face in  agony as the non space around the mirror grew deathly cold.  Ice began forming on Clove’s body as the  black lightning shot out around her wildly, standing her long hair on end as  she screamed in pain, but she inexorably drew whatever she was grasping out of  the girl’s soul…</p><p>
  Then she fell backwards and suddenly all was  quiet.  They all looked at the mirror in  stunned shock.</p><p>
  Gone were the lashes and cuts, the chains and the  indefinable sense of violation.  The girl  in the mirror stood whole, and almost innocent.</p><p>
  And instead of the black crescent on her forehead,  there now resided a golden one, its horns pointing upright.</p><p>
  Clove groaned, and they turned to see her sitting up,  holding out an object that looked very much like a sea urchin made of black  crystal.  She crushed it, and it vanished  into nothingness.</p><p>
  “Xi’an Chi, you are such a <em>bastard</em>.” Clove said weakly.</p><p>
  Then her eyes rolled upwards and she fainted.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the cliff, her legs curled up  against her and her arms wrapped around them, heedless of her nakedness.  Her body shivered in the cold wind but her  mind was far away, and she was oblivious to it.</p><p>
  Soft footsteps approached.  She heard them, but it made no impression on  her.  Voices rose and fell in the  distance as she heard her name called, but she made no effort to answer.  Even the soft rustle of cloth as someone  knelt beside her provoked no response.</p><p>
  “Uc-chan?”  came  Rei’s soft voice.</p><p>
  Ukyo’s eyes didn’t waver from their fixed stare, but  she whispered, “I blew it.”</p><p>
  “Uc-chan?  I – I  don’t understand.”</p><p>
  “I blew it, Rei.   I could have saved her and I blew it.”</p><p>
  “Who?”  Her  voice was full of loving concern, and it made Ukyo wince… why couldn’t <em>she</em> have been just like that?</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu was here, Rei.  I tried to save her and I <em>blew</em> it.   I failed to be what she needed.  I  failed to be her guardian.”  Her eyes  closed as she recalled the warning her dream had tried to give her.  <em>She  loves too intently to ever give less than the entirety of her self.</em> “I  wasn’t there for her in the way she <em>needed</em>,  Rei.”</p><p>
  “Uc-chan, what happened?”</p><p>
  “She came to me, Rei.   She came to me because she loves me.   She came to me because she needed my love…and I drove her away!”  Ukyo’s voice broke as she was racked with  sobs.  </p><p>
  Rei tried to place her hand on her shoulder, but drew  it back as Ukyo flinched.  She turned  pleading eyes to where Nabiki was running up with Tao-Ching, barely noticing  the bunnygirl was wearing nothing but glowing pink armor.  Nabiki stopped when she saw the look in Rei’s  eyes and nodded as she held up a hand to stop the big cat.</p><p>
  “Ukyo.  Please…  what happened?” Rei asked as kindly as she could.</p><p>
  “She just wanted my love.  That’s all she wanted.  Just my love…”</p><p>
  “I don’t understand Uc-chan.  Did – did Zhu Shu...”</p><p>
  “She’s not to blame.   It’s my fault.  It’s <em>all</em> my fault…” she sobbed.  “Oh my poor Zhu-chan.  What have I done to you?” </p><p>
  “Uc-chan?” Rei’s voice was pained</p><p>
  Ukyo whispered something that Rei couldn’t hear, but  behind her she heard Nabiki gasp.</p><p>
  “I – I can’t understand you, Uc-chan?”</p><p>
  “I offered her my love, and I kissed her, and when she  responded, I got scared.  I made her rape  me, Rei.  She responded to my offer of  love, and I turned it into something horrible because I was afraid of how  intensely she responded.  <em>I</em> made her love into <em>rape</em>! She <em>needed</em> me, and because I was a coward, I <em>failed</em> her!”  Ukyo  sobbed.  “Just like I did when she  offered herself as my fiancée.  I wanted  to <em>save</em> her, and instead, <em>I</em> <em>drove  her away</em>!  And her very last thought  that I heard through the link was about how much of a monster <em>she</em> was…”</p><p>
  Rei didn’t stop when Ukyo flinched this time, but  pulled the other girl into a hug, and held her as the tears fell like rain.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Ke Lun was closing the club’s rear door, still in the  playboy bunny outfit she had taken to wearing while managing the club, when she  felt the eyes upon her.  She sighed.  Was it another group of hentai boys who were  going to try and pick her up again, or possibly an attempt to mug her?  Not that it mattered, but she almost wished  that she had changed back to her normal form.  <em>Almost</em>.  Getting to be young and pretty again did have  immense appeal after all.</p><p>
  She could have simply leapt to the rooftop and away,  but where was the fun in that?  Putting  on her best bewildered dumb bunny look, she pretended to look nervously down  the alley before hesitantly walking forward.   As she drew close to the location where she felt the eyes, she prepared  to attack.</p><p>
  But the battlecry of “<em>SWEETO!!!</em>” the small figure gave as he leaped froze her in shock  and she let out a “Gah!” as she felt a face bury itself in her bosom, and  smallish hands caressing her breasts.   Then she put her hands on her hips as a massive battle aura formed  around her, the pale yellow light illuminating the white haired figure latched  on to her chest as she gave him a hard stare.</p><p>
  Eventually he realized he hadn’t been flung bodily  away as usual and looked up, giving her a happy grin.  “Wow, dearie, you’re making an old man feel  loved!”</p><p>
  “Gotten your fill yet, ‘Happy’?” she said icily.</p><p>
  He plumped her breasts a few more times as he sighed  in joy.  Then he did a double take as he  finally noticed the battle aura that was slowly cracking the pavement around  them.  “Um… why haven’t you… um.”</p><p>
  “Plucked you off, stomped you into the ground, and  jumped up and down on you in rage for several hours?” she asked casually.</p><p>
  He blinked. “Uhhhh.”</p><p>
  She gave him a happy bunnygirl grin.  “I’m savoring the thought of that for later,”  she gushed.  “I just want to know that  you’re enjoying getting to run your hands all over my body!  After all, you’re the only man <em>entitled </em>to.”  Despite the excited happy girl voice she  used, the battle aura was starting to crack the walls and lift the broken rock  all around them into the air.</p><p>
  “Entitled to?”</p><p>
  “Of course!  I  mean, you are <em>MY HUSBAND</em>!!!”</p><p>
  The blow drove him into the concrete, then through it  as the impact shattered the ground and the explosion blew down the walls to  either side of the alley.</p><p>
  As Happosai tried to stand, dazed, Ke Lun reached into  her cleavage and pulled out a collar and chain.   Before he recovered enough to realize what she was doing, she snapped it  closed around his neck.  He didn’t even  notice it as he staggered, then sat back down.</p><p>
  “Owwww.   What  do you mean, <em>husband?</em>”</p><p>
  Then his eyes widened, and his hands flew to the  collar.  His eyes followed the chain to  where it was handcuffed to Ke Lun’s wrist.</p><p>
  “When Lo Shen told me that Zhu Shu had inadvertently  given you a set of panties and that the seal was broken, I figured you would be  along sooner or later, Happy.  I’ve been  waiting a long, long time to use this.” Ke Lun said as she tugged on the leash. </p><p>
  “Co – co – cologne?”</p><p>
  “Awww, I’m touched.   You actually remember.  I mean,  after you left me on our wedding night, I thought for sure you must have been  touched by amnesia or something.  I mean,  it <em>certainly</em> couldn’t have been  because you <em>didn’t love me</em>,  right?  You did make <em>so</em> many promises to love me forever… right up till you actually got  into my bed.”</p><p>
  “What is this thing?!?”</p><p>
  “A marriage collar.   It’s used for training recalcitrant males who are captured in war.  I wouldn’t bother trying to take it off.  It’s tied into your chi.  If you actually succeeded in removing it,  you’d die.”  She wrapped the chain around  her wrist until she had Happosai dangling, then started walking down the street  whistling happily as he struggled uselessly.</p><p>
  “What are you going to do to me you, you crazy  Amazon!”</p><p>
  “Why Happy, is that any way to talk to your wife?  And I have a perfectly suitable revenge in  mind for you.  Who knows, being you, you  might even <em>like</em> it.”</p><p>
  She swung him back and forth like a purse, amused as  he vainly tried to grab ahold of anything to try and escape.  She giggled.   “Oh, Ai Ren, Ke Lun is so happy!” she said in her best copy of Shan Pu’s  kittenish voice.  She did a twirling  little dance as she walked, enjoying the screams of protest.  As she opened the door to the Bunny Hutch’s  apartment, she held him at eye level, and still in that little girl voice,  asked “Happy really want know what Ke Lun plan?”</p><p>
  Happosai tried his puppy dog face.  “You – you wouldn’t kill a harmless old man  like me would you?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun laughed, still playing the dumb bunny.  “No.   Ke Lun have much better plan in mind.” she cooed.</p><p>
  “Letting me go?”</p><p>
  She shook her head and put a finger on his nose as she  smiled enormously.  “Nan.  Ni. Chuan.” She said, enunciating each syllable separately in her best innocent  school girl act as she tapped his nose in time. </p><p>
  Happosai blinked as he digested the import of her  words.  “Spring of drowned girl?”  Then his eyes went wide in horror as he  remembered.  “Oh no.  Not Jusenkyo.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun giggled.   “Welcome to hell, Happy.  I hope  you enjoy your life as my Sister-Wife.”   She laughed louder as he screamed in horror.  “If you’d just stayed in your cave, you could  have escaped this fate, my dear, dear husband.   I’ve spent centuries contemplating it, and making preparations. I’ve  waited for this day for ever so long.”   She hugged him to her breasts and smiled as for probably the first time  in his life, he tried to crawl his way out of a pair.  “Look on the bright side.  Now you can <em>wear</em> all those pretty slips of silk you’ve collected…”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Kodachi flushed the last of the dye remover from her  hair with the sprayer and scrubbed her itching scalp.  It had taken three applications to remove the  black dye, and it had left her hair feeling a little brittle and her scalp a  little raw, but for the first time in fifteen years, her hair was its natural  color.  She looked up into the mirror and  tried to smile.  It was a nervous,  tentative thing.</p><p>
  She dried it with the towel and brushed it out, having  to firmly stop herself from tucking her ears under it, and left it loose,  taking a deep breath as she opened the bathroom door and entered the main hotel  room.</p><p>
  Mousse was waiting for her at the hotel’s restaurant,  and they were planning to try and find someplace to dance afterwards, but  Kodachi wasn’t sure she was going to make it, even though it had been her  suggestion.  Her stomach felt like it was  filled with needle sharp icicles, and she was already dreading the next step of  the evening.</p><p>
  She sat on the bed in her bathrobe and wrung her  hands, dreading the knock on the door that she was expecting.  While her school uniform had been fine enough  to walk around in, Mousse had suggested she have a nice dress for dinner and  dancing, and she had nervously agreed. </p><p>
  She wished she could tell if the Chinese boy was  simply trying to be nice to her because he felt he owed her his service for  saving his life.  He had been so dead set  against her when she had threatened that she would make him love her, and she  had given up entirely on even that in her depression over Akane.  Yet the attitude he had displayed to her  since rescuing her had been far kinder and more caring than he’d ever been to  her previously.  It was even amusing when  he accidentally started talking to some random object or person, thinking it  was her because his vision was so terrible.   He always corrected when she spoke to him, or tried too, and it was kind  of cute that he was so helpless.  He  really needed her to help as his eyes.</p><p>
  And she was starting to think she really needed him to  be her courage.</p><p>
  The knock on her door startled her, and she nearly  jumped.  Panic set in as she froze,  terrified of what the reaction was going to be when she opened the door.</p><p>
  But Mousse was counting on her to meet him for dinner,  with undyed hair and uncovered ears…</p><p>
  She took a deep breath and jerked the door open.</p><p>
  The girl on the other side had been about to knock  again and she gave her a startled look.   “Oh, Hi!  I’m delivering a dress  for a Miss Kodachi Kuno?”</p><p>
  Kodachi nervously nodded.  “That’s me.   Um… come in.”</p><p>
  The girl stepped inside.  “Would you like some help making sure it fits  properly, Miss Kuno?  I’m the  seamstress’s apprentice and I can make any spot adjustments you might need.”</p><p>
  Kodachi blinked at the girl’s seemingly nonchalant  acceptance of her ears and hair.  “I – I  would.” Then she even remembered to add “Please.”</p><p>
  The girl gave her a happy grin and laid her box on the  bed.  “You’re going to look adorable in  black, Miss Kuno, especially with such beautifully white hair.”  She held up the short black dress, and showed  it to her.  “Should I make a spot for  your tail?  I can hide the opening under  the bow.”</p><p>
  “Tail?”  Kodachi  blinked.</p><p>
  The girl  took a  closer look at her ears and blushed.   “Oh, dear.  I’m sorry.  I thought you were a kitsune like me.  My apologies.   It’s been a long time since I met an inugami.”</p><p>
  Kodachi blinked several more times.  “You’re a <em>kitsune</em>?”</p><p>
  The girl nodded, then sparkled, and her black hair  changed to a gorgeous coppery red, and tall ears tipped with black popped up as  a bushy foxtail poked out of the back of her skirt.  “I’m not supposed to change in front of  humans, but we’re both youkai, right?”   She smiled.  “My names Ryune  Minamoto. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>
  Kodachi returned the small bow.  “I – I never knew that there were others like  me.”</p><p>
  The girl smiled and laughed merrily.  “There are lots of youkai and half-youkai in Japan, Miss  Kuno.  I have family all over Tokyo.”  She tilted her head in thought.  “Hmmm.   Kuno… Kuno… Oh yeah, aren’t you from Nerima?  I had heard that the inugami clan there was  the Kunos.”</p><p>
  “You- you have heard of us?  You know of our family shame?”  Kodachi was aghast.</p><p>
  “Shame?”  Ryune  blinked.  “There’s no shame in being  youkai.”  She looked more closely at  Kodachi.  “Especially if you’re a full  youkai, like you.  Why I think there must  be at least three dozen different youkai families in Nerima, and I heard the  Kuno’s have been Youkai nobility for ages.”</p><p>
  Kodachi sat down.   “Full youkai?  I’m – I’m only  half!”</p><p>
  Ryune shook her head.   “Do you have a day a month where you revert to human?”</p><p>
  Kodachi shook her head as well.  “I – I have never had a day when I was not as  you see me.”</p><p>
  “Then you’re full youkai.”  Ryune tapped her nose.  “I can smell the difference.  You’re only half inugami, but there’s no  scent of human about you.  I can’t place  the other half of your scent though.   It’s not one of the animal kindred though.  Was your mother an inugami, or your father?”</p><p>
  “My mother married into the Kuno family. She was very  unhappy that I was born with ears.  She –  she called it a curse.  She had great  plans for my marriage into a family of great power and influence, and she felt  my ears would make that impossible.  She  – she was always very harsh with me about it.”</p><p>
  Ryune frowned.   “She had to be the source of the other youkai strain in you, but she  sounds like a very evil woman to me.”   She shrugged.  “My grandmother  could probably place your scent.  She’s a  wily old fox.  I’m just average.  Shape shifting and a few illusions are about  all I can do.”  She held up the dress  again.  “Ready to try this on?”</p><p>
  Kodachi nodded, and stood, dropping her robe  negligently as she accepted the dress.   The girl helped her into it, and did the buttons up the back as she checked  the fit critically.  </p><p>
  “Hmmm, not bad.   Let me just bring in the waist a touch and tighten up the bust and  you’ll look as ravishable as you smell.” Ryune said with a grin as her fox tail  wagged.</p><p>
  Kodachi blinked as she realized the girl was flirting,  then she laughed, a real, honest laugh that was a far cry from her typical  stilted “ohohohoho.”  She smiled as she  reached out to touch her hand.  “Thank  you so much, Ryune.  Tonight is the first  night I have ever gone out without hiding my ears and dyeing my hair.  I was terribly nervous.”</p><p>
  The kitsune laughed too.  “May I suggest a local teen club?  It’s called the Fox’s Den, cuz the owner is a  five-tails.  It’s the hangout for most of  the youkai teens around here.  You’ll  probably love it, and most everyone will likely have their ears out. Oh, and  when you get back to Nerima, what school do you go to?”</p><p>
  “Furinkan.”</p><p>
  “Cool, my cousin Kyoko goes there.  That’s where I heard about the Kunos  from.  She used to chase after this guy  named Tatewaki who was a Kuno.”</p><p>
  Kodachi blinked.   “He’s my brother.  And I remember  Kyoko.  Is she a Kitsune too?”</p><p>
  Ryune nodded.   “Yeah.  And she’s way cuter than I  am.  She even made the cheerleading  squad, I heard - at least all she writes about is Ai-sempai this, Ai-sempai  that.  I’m sure she could introduce you  to all the other youkai at Furinkan.  I  hear at least a third of the school is one youkai clan or another.  Like my school, it’s one of the few schools  in Tokyo that cater to non-humans, even if it’s a secret.  Kyoko even said they had a dragon enrolled  there in her last e-mail.”</p><p>
  Kodachi smiled.   “That would be Song Zhu Shu.”  She  laughed at the irony.  She had spent so  long, and expended so much effort… and now - now that she had failed utterly in  every way possible, now that she had accepted her fate, she thought maybe she  could look at her future with a little bit of hope after all.</p><p>
  <em>Maybe mother was wrong after all…</em></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kasumi blinked as Ying-Ying walked into the kitchen  straight through the wall.</p><p>
  “Oh, my, is everything okay?” she asked upon seeing  the ghost’s distraught face.  </p><p>
  “Konatsu’s fainted.   Do you have any good teas to restore energy?”</p><p>
  Kasumi nodded.   “I’ll bring out a tea set immediately.   Should I call Ono-kun?”</p><p>
  “Ono-kun?  Oh!  you mean Doctor Tofu.  Yes, please.  She’s used up an enormous amount of magical  energy.  Lo Shen is tending her, but  she’s not a healing specialist, and my abilities are primarily spiritual.”</p><p>
  Kasumi nodded.  Ying-Ying left her as she was pulling out her  cellphone, and returned to the dojo, where Ami was looking through her visor as  she scanned the still unconscious Beruche.</p><p>
  “Kasumi will bring out some tea momentarily, and she’s  calling Doctor Tofu too.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “Good.  From Ke Lun’s reports,  he’s an excellent physician.”  She looked  over at Ami.  “Well, Miss Mizuno, what  does your computer have to say?”</p><p>
  Ami touched her visor and it shrank in on itself and  vanished.  “I can’t read any of the  negative energy readings on her that I was getting earlier.  If anything she seems to read of Silver  Millennium energy now.  Her spectrum’s  almost identical to my own.”</p><p>
  “And Konatsu?”</p><p>
  “She’s reading as normal, just her energy levels are  really low.  She’s exhausted.”  She tapped a few keys on her little  computer.  “I can’t even separate out her  signal from Clove.  If I hadn’t seen her,  I’d never suspect there are two people in one body.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying nodded.   “Konatsu doesn’t even know, Ami.   And until earlier today, I wasn’t positive.”  She placed a hand on Konatsu’s forehead.  “Clove did something no-one would have ever  suspected.  Konatsu’s male side is the  real Konatsu, but I think her female side is technically Clove.  Clove’s body formed the template that  Konatsu’s female form copied, and she’s capable of exerting full control if she  wants.  I started suspecting the other  night when I spent the night with Konatsu.”   She blushed.  “I – I had thought I  read the desires of Konatsu for me, but when I got there, and we talked, I felt  as Clove consciously decided not to force Konatsu to seduce me, and simply let  Konatsu and I sleep.  I could feel as she  removed the sexual compulsion from Konatsu.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen raised an eyebrow.  “Remembering Clove’s predilection to seduce  anything cute and feminine, that surprises me.”</p><p>
  “She’s been living in Konatsu’s head, and has seen  every thought and memory she’s had.  She  felt sorry for her, and decided not to interfere in her relationship with  me.  I could feel that in her mind before  she submerged herself behind Konatsu again.”   She stroked Konatsu’s hair as she gazed at her lovingly.  “Konatsu has had it so much worse in her life  that she made Clove feel ashamed of how sorry she was feeling for herself.  She made the black dragon in Clove that was  crying for revenge and blood retreat.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen chuckled.   “What irony.  She found the  perfect vessel to enable her to carry out her revenge, and it backfired.”  She shook her head.  “I would never have thought there was any way  to tame the black dragon in Clove’s heart, and all it took was an innocent  child.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying shook her head.  “Konatsu is not so innocent as you might  think, Lo Shen.  She has been trying to  assassinate her step family for years.   She’s just terribly inept at chicanery.   Had she ever truly been pushed over the edge into madness, she would  likely have become a mass murder.  She’s  a genius Kunoichi, as lethal and deadly an assassin as there can be.  If she had not had such a sweet and gentle  nature to begin with, I shudder to think what their combination would have  resulted in.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen raised an eyebrow.  “I see, so her exceptional gift in chemistry  is due to the training she has had in making poisons.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying nodded. </p><p>
  “That would make her Ye-Ying’s reincarnation  then.  That relieves me some.  I can worry a little less about Zhu Shu  knowing she is with Phoenix  and Orihime.  I had not been absolutely  sure which one Ukyo was until now.”</p><p>
  Ami blinked.  “Ye-Ying?  Orihime?   I’m confused.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “As you are the reincarnations of the Moon Princess and her Guardians,  so too does Zhu Shu have her reincarnated companions.  Lady Orihime, the Dragon’s Guardian, who has  been reborn as Ukyo Kuonji.  Lady  Ying-Ying,” she indicated the pink haired ghost, who blushed. “The Imperial  Physician, and priestess of the Cult of the Dragon.  Lady Ye-Ying,” she pointed to Konatsu. “The  Songbird of the Court of the Dragon, and the Royal Assassin.  And lastly, your very own companion, Sailor  Mars, the Lady Phoenix, as she was known in the Empire of the Dragon, a title  bestowed on her by Lin Tzu at their first meeting.  These four were Lin Tzu’s principle mates,  though she had almost a dozen wives.   They were all lost in the fall, giving their lives to secure Lin Tzu’s  freedom from the clutches of Xi’an Chi and in the fight against Beryl.”</p><p>
  “What of her other wives?”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying spread her hands.  “Just as Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Pluto  have yet to be revealed, neither have I been made aware of when our other wives  shall be reborn, or even if they already have.   Legend only reveals what he is ready for me to know.”</p><p>
  She blinked as a tea cup was placed in her hand, and  they all realized Kasumi had quietly come in while they had been talking and  made the tea.</p><p>
  Lo Shen stared at her in shock.  “Child, how did you manage to enter without <em>my</em> being aware of you?  No one has managed that in two hundred  years.”</p><p>
  Kasumi shrugged.   “I just didn’t want to disturb your conversation.”</p><p>
  “How much did you hear?”</p><p>
  Kasumi smiled.   “Do not fear elder.  I will keep  my mouth shut about our extra visitor.  I  shall have to speak to Sandal about adding several rooms to the house  immediately though.  Once Zhu Shu and  Nabiki return, we shall be quite crowded.”   She looked at the unconscious Beruche.   “Is she going to be staying as well?”</p><p>
  Lo Shen shook her head.  “I believe I will feel safer if she is kept  with me and Ke Lun at the Bunny Hutch.   If her companions attempt to rescue her, I would not wish them to attack  our Empress’s home.  While the wards will  shield you from mystical assault, they were not made to repel an army.”</p><p>
  Kasumi nodded, then raised a finger.  “That reminds me.  Ke Lun called and asked me to tell you when  you were not busy that she has, um, acquired a new pet?”</p><p>
  Lo Shen cackled.   “Now <em>that </em>I cannot wait to  see.  Thank you Kasumi.  I believe once Tofu has seen to our patients  here, I will take this one home and see how Ke Lun’s ‘pet’ is doing.  Knowing her plans, it should be quite  amusing.”</p><p>
  Ami was looking at her watch.  “Oh, I didn’t realize it was this late.  If I may be excused, elder?  I must get home and sleep before school  tomorrow.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “Tell the Senshi we will probably have some answers out of our guest  tomorrow.   And let me know if you would  like more education in magic.  I think  you would make an excellent healing mage, like Ying-Ying here.”</p><p>
  Ami blushed prettily at the compliment and bowed as  she left, letting Doctor Tofu enter as she did so.</p><p>
  He examined both patients, and Lo Shen noted happily  that while he was certainly overjoyed to be in Kasumi’s presence, he was not  displaying the brainlock that had marked him so strongly before.  It looked like the empathic bond Kasumi had  forged was functioning perfectly.</p><p>
  “They are both simply exhausted, elder.  I shall give you a tea to give them when they  wake up, but pure simple sleep is the best thing for them right now.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “Well I shall take this one home then.   If you would be so kind as to help Ying-Ying get Konatsu up to her  room?  She has a small problem with  intangibility…”</p>
<p> * * * * *</p>
<p>Urd entered the Yggdrasil complex with Mara in tow,  earning a glare from Peorth but no other reaction from the rival goddess.  Urd thumbed her nose at her as she headed to  her secondary terminal and started when the privacy screen snapped into place  even before she sat down.</p><p>
  “Greetings Goddess Urd, Goddess Mara.  I have been emailing you for days.”  Phoenixmoon said as she took her seat.</p><p>
  Urd sighed.  “I  was in the backwaters of China.  No TVs and no cell service.”</p><p>
  “I see.  You  should be made aware then of several developments that have occurred in your  absence.  Of primary importance is the  appearance of Zhu Shu’s fourth love interest, Konatsu Kenzan.  It seems now that the ghost Ying-Ying is  capable of travelling freely betwixt the mortal realm and the spirit world, the  Dragon is taking a bit more of a direct hand in things, and Ying-Ying met the  girl and brought her to the Tendo’s.  She  and Konatsu have been enrolled in Furinkan High, in the same homeroom as Akane,  Ranma and Shan Pu.”</p><p>
  Urd raised an eyebrow.   “Ying-Ying is <em>LIVING</em> in the  mortal realm now?”</p><p>
  “That is correct, Goddess Urd.  As she is not technically a ghost in the  traditional sense, but has become a guardian spirit, she is fully capable of  maintaining her corporeality on the mortal plane in much the same way that the  natural spirits and youkai can.  She does  draw on the life essences radiated by those around her, but her primary energy  seems to be coming directly from her bonds to Zhu Shu, Akane, Ukyo, Rei, and  Konatsu.  As guardian spirits go, she’s  in the upper S class, possibly even a U class. If she figures out how, she  could manifest physically as easily as any youkai.”</p><p>
  Urd shook her head.   “I wonder why Legend didn’t teach her how?”</p><p>
  “I do not know, Goddess Urd.”</p><p>
  “Anything else going on?”</p><p>
  “I have received the results of the investigation of  the shockwave which accompanied the wish which Goddess Peorth recently  transmitted.”</p><p>
  “And?”</p><p>
  “The shockwave was a result of Zhu Shu, Goddess  Urd.  She was directly exposed to the  wish transmittal beam, and due to her unique connection to the Dragon, she caused  a resonance effect of nearly catastrophic proportions.  For a few seconds, she merged partially with  the Ultimate Force.  The resonance most  likely has had unpredictable effects on her curse, but Kami-Sama himself  interceded in time to prevent her from overloading and dying.  She has been sealed and limited.”</p><p>
  Urd blinked.   “Sealed!  You mean…”</p><p>
  “Yes, Goddess Urd.   Zhu Shu has been sealed as a goddess.   She had to be.  Apparently her  power levels following the direct exposure to the Ultimate Force exceeded the  capacity of the mortal realm to contain.   Without the seals, she would have destroyed the entire island of Japan  upon her arrival in the past, and created a shockwave large enough to have  driven the Earth out of solar orbit.  She  has been sealed to prevent her from accidentally accessing her full  strength.  As Legend’s child, she was not  expected to reach her current power levels until she was at least a thousand  years more experienced.”</p><p>
  Urd blinked.   “A- a thousand years?”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu is effectively as immortal as you are Goddess  Urd.  Had not Chaos intervened in the  guise of Metallia and Xi’an Chi, and seduced Beryl into instigating the war  between Earth and the Moon   Kingdom, Lin Tzu could  have ruled the Dragon Empire for eternity.   Instead, due to wounds she received during the Fall, she died less than  six months after the birth of her daughter, at the relatively young age of  ninety three.   Like Serenity and her  Guardians, she can be killed, but will age imperceptibly once she has reached  adulthood. Practical immortality was one of the major achievements of the  Silver Millennium, if you recall. There is also a better than ninety nine  percent likelihood that due to exposure to the energy fields surrounding Zhu  Shu and the Senshi, the latent genetic codes for longevity will also be  activated within all their close companions.”</p><p>
  “Why have you never told us any of this before?” Mara  interjected.</p><p>
  “This report is classified, Goddess Mara.  Only you, Urd, Kami-Sama and Legend have been  cleared to access it.  The report given  to Peorth states only that a resonance effect occurred.  I was not authorized to give you these  details previously.  Since Chaos shall  soon discover this same information, its possession is no longer a danger to  you.”</p><p>
  Urd sighed.   “Any other news to report?”</p><p>
  “The Senshi have defeated two attempts by Blackmoon to  corrupt locales within Tokyo with negative spiritual vortex’s and have captured  the Blackmoon operative called Beruche.   Also, Kodachi and Mousse have been making progress since Kodachi’s  attempted suicide and Mousse’s rescue of her.”</p><p>
  Urd and Mara both sat up in shock.  “Kodachi tried to commit suicide?” Urd yelled  at the computer.</p><p>
  “Correct, Goddess Urd.   She discovered that Akane was currently a Senshi, and because she is a youkai,  and technically could be classed as a youma, she went into a severe depressive  episode and had to be rescued by Mousse when she threw herself from Tokyo tower.  They are presently dancing at a club called  the Fox’s Den, and Kodachi has been introduced to the existence of the general  youkai population.  It seems to have been  extremely therapeutic for her.”</p><p>
  Urd nodded.   “Good.  That damned succubus who  was her mother traumatized her enough.   It’s about time she started to heal. As bad as that could have gone,  it’s good to know something positive came of it. And I notice you’re calling  him Mousse now.”</p><p>
  “Mousse is calling himself Mousse now.  It seems his rescue of Kodachi also started  the healing process in him as well.  He  has set aside his identity as Mu Si, who had vowed to never love anyone but  Shan Pu, and has decided to try being Mousse, servant and friend of Kodachi  Kuno.  There are certain to be rough  patches, but they have made an excellent start to recovery.”</p><p>
  Urd nodded.   “That’s one more down.  Alright,  call up the lists and let’s see who else we’ve still got to work on while we’re  waiting for our temporal delinquents.”</p><p>
  “Very well, Goddess Urd.  The best possibility for your next match is  coming on screen now.”</p><p>
  Urd and Mara both blinked as the monitor suddenly  began displaying a picture of Ai Konjou…</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Zhu Shu lay in the middle of the castle courtyard  surrounded by the pulverized fragments of death and decay and cried.  She’d smashed the scattered remains of the  ancient battle in rage after her attempt to commit suicide had met with  failure.  She had allowed herself to  plummet from nearly two miles overhead and all she’d done was leave an impact  crater in the ground where she’d collided head first.  Slashing her wrists had also been in vain,  the cuts sealing almost as soon as they were made, and she’d drawn the sword  out of her chest after twenty minutes of agony.  </p><p>
  She was a monster, a demon.  She deserved to die, and she was tormented by  her inability to do so.</p><p>
  She was contemplating seeing if the giant sword in the  throne room could succeed where her own had failed when she heard Naraku’s  chuckle.  In rage she hurled herself at  him, only to find her body collapsing before she had moved ten feet.</p><p>
  “So my pet, it seems something has finally awakened  you.  That will make you far more useful  than the animal you were.” Naraku said in fluent Mandarin</p><p>
  “Kill me, you bastard!”</p><p>
  “Why?  When you  are so much more entertaining alive?”  He  lifted his hand and a darkly shimmering sphere floated around him and deposited  a naked young girl in front of Zhu Shu.   “I have even brought you your favorite repast, my darling Little Mouse.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shuddered as she looked over the terrified  girl.  “Let her go.  You have no use for her, and she has done  nothing to deserve death.”</p><p>
  “You do not wish to taste the pleasures of her  body?  You seemed so <em>eager</em> for those of the girl, Ukyo.” Naraku mocked.  “But, if you do not wish her…”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu screamed in horror as Naraku’s tentacles shot  out and the girl perished in a spray of blood that drenched her.  She glared at him through the blood dripping  down her face as she tried to rise up from her hands and knees, but her body  wouldn’t respond.  “I am going to kill  you, you bastard.” she swore through clenched teeth.</p><p>
  Naraku chuckled.   “Your venom is wasted on me, my pet.   You are as much a monster as I.   Your poor Ukyo was crying her eyes out as you left her.  I would not doubt but that she will come for  you now, not in love, but to cut out your heart.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu hung her head.   “It is all I deserve.”</p><p>
  “Yes.  I watched  your pitiful attempts to end your life.”   He floated nearer and knelt, reaching out to cup her face.  “Do you truly seek death?”</p><p>
  She spat. </p><p>
  “Serve me, fulfill a few simple requests, and I will  have exhausted my need of you.  If death  is what you seek, it shall be your reward.”</p><p>
  “What do you want?   You have already forced me to slay those whose corpses rot across the  valley.  How much more death must you  force me to cause.”</p><p>
  “Bring me the Shikon shards born by Kouga of the okami,  and that born by Kohaku the traitor, and there will be but one final task I  will ask of you before I grant you your final desire.”</p><p>
  “Must I kill them to do so?”</p><p>
  “Without their shards, they will be no threat.  I care not how you accomplish your task, but  they will probably fight to the death to keep their fragments.  I shall even be magnanimous. Once you have  them, keep their shards for yourself, for now.   I will retrieve them from your corpse when you have finished your  tasks.”</p><p>
  “And the final task?”</p><p>
  “Mouryoumaru.   But hurry, my pet.  Your Ukyo  knows where you are, and it will take but a week for her to come for your  heart.  You are still charged to prevent  anyone from entering this castle.  The  shard you bear will ensure your obedience with that duty.  It would be a shame if you were forced to  slay your love as well as rape her.”</p><p>
  “Why should I not just fly to her and let her kill me  as I deserve?”</p><p>
  “Because, my pet, you cannot die so long as I hold  your heart in my hand.”  He smiled evilly  as he held up the pumping organ, and she felt the tremor in her chest as he  squeezed it.  “Indeed, if you return to  her at all, I will kill <em>her</em>.  Even as we speak, my agent stands but a  heart’s beat away from her, and a single word will result in your Ukyo’s  death.”  The heart sank into his hand as  he replaced it with a globe showing Kagura watching as Rei led a still sobbing  Ukyo into a hut.  “Her life depends on  your obedience, Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  Chills ran down her spine as she thought of Ukyo dying  at the mad youkai’s whim.  Even if she  did obey him, she had no guarantee he would keep any of his promises.  But for now, she had no choice.  She would serve him. </p><p>
  But when the time came for her death, she promised  herself she would drag him screaming into the abyss with her.  </p>
