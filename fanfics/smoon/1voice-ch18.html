<p>Their resident genius suddenly went very, very pale.</p>
<p>“Ami,  Ami, are you alright?” Makoto was at her side at a moments notice,  kneeling next to the smaller woman where she sat at the end of a long  couch, her legs folded underneath her as she busily analyzed several  windows on her computer.</p>
<p>Minako spun her long legs off Rei’s lap  and sat up. Haruka and Michiru left their tentative posts in the back  of the room and came forward. Setsuna quietly slipped in through the  door as if summoned, and took a seat near a wide bank of windows  inconspicuously.</p>
<p>“Ami-chan?” Makoto asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“The  youma,” the Mercurian’s voice threatened to betray her, “They’re on the  move. They’re leaving the pole and heading south – straight for us!”</p>
<p>Minako  jumped to her feet. She lifted her wrist and hailed the Moon’s  tacticians, shouting orders through her communicator. “Move the armies  out <em>now</em>!” She barked.</p>
<p>The voice on the other end of her communicator was slow and confused. <em>“But… to where, Venus-sama?”</em></p>
<p>“Just send them north! The youma are marching down from the pole!”</p>
<p>An  indeterminate number of voices on the other end of the communicator  exploded in a flurry of questions and exclamations. Minako cut the  transmission and lowered her hand slowly. It hung limply at her side  for several moments before she turned back to face her team.</p>
<p>“The  Moon’s army will meet the threat with us. What little of their armies  the other planets could spare will march with them to defend the  Palace.”</p>
<p>Ami’s ashen face regained some amount of color. Her  fingers flew over her incorporeal keyboard. “According to my numbers,  the odds are five to one, youma advantage. If the Earth sends… <em>when</em> the Earth sends their human army, there’s no telling how that number will change.”</p>
<p>With  a pursed brow, Makoto stood and turned towards her leader. “What of the  armies of Jupiter?” She looked to Haruka’s avoidant gaze. “And Uranus?  They should have ample warriors to spare. They could have them here-“</p>
<p>“Even  those great armies have been drastically reduced.” Minako said  bitterly. “The forces they could spare away from the youma invasion on  their own territories have already gathered and are supplementing the  Moon’s as we speak.”</p>
<p>Haruka leveled a hard gaze at the other warriors. “We’re already fighting at full capacity.”</p>
<p>An  uncomfortable silence threatened to smother the women, the ugly  reminder that it wasn’t just the Moon that was suffering at the hands  of the Earth, but that the planets each of them called home were also  slowly losing to the threat of the youma that took the lives and energy  of innocents for the sake of Metallia’s cause.</p>
<p>“But our armies have <em>us</em>.” Makoto’s good-natured chuckle wavered. Her smile was forced. “That’s gotta count for something, ne?”</p>
<p>Minako’s voice was uncharacteristically dour. She turned her back on her warriors. “But the Terrans have <em>Metallia</em>.”</p>
<p>Rei  frowned. The Martian stood and crossed the distance that separated her  from her commander. She stood, shoulder to shoulder with the Venusian,  offering silent reassurance as they gazed out the bank of windows to  the white capped mountain range of Montes Haemus and the perceived  challenges that lay beyond them to the north.</p>
<p>Haruka cracked her  knuckles. Michiru looked to Setsuna. The outers shared a meaningful  look. There was no doubt that they would join forces with the inners.</p>
<p>“Wait.”  Haruka’s voice was a sudden whisper. Her gaze trailed out the window  for a moment, and then she frowned. She dropped to the ground abruptly,  crouched on one leg with a knee to the floor, and splayed her hand open  on the stone beneath her feet.</p>
<p>Several stories up, the floor of the Palace began to shake.</p>
<p>It was slow at first, a gentle rumble, a subtle horizontal shifting of the floors and walls. It gradually began to increase.</p>
<p>Princess  Serenity stumbled out of her room from the end of the hall, a panicked  expression on her expressive face as she dashed to join her guardians  in their courtyard.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” She cried, finding safety  between Ami, still furiously typing at her computer, and Makoto, who  stood behind her at the ready.</p>
<p>There was no time for  explanations. The senshi found themselves moving towards their  Princess, forming a loose circle around her. The clear skies seen  through the large windows darkened. A haze covered the consistently  clear, thin atmosphere of the Moon. Makoto frowned. A lightening storm  rolled in off the horizon, boasting deadly, blue-white forks of  electricity that carried a deafening thunder in its wake. The lights in  the room dimmed slightly, and the electric candelabras flickered.</p>
<p>Then,  silence. And as soon as the phenomenon had begun, it stopped. The  rumbling in the Palace ceased. The dark clouds broke up. The thunder  became distant.</p>
<p>“Effects of the Sun?” Minako asked.</p>
<p>Ami never once pulled her attention from her computer. “Doubtlessly.”</p>
<p>“Metallia.” Michiru’s voice was quiet. “She’s ramping up her power.”</p>
<p>Serenity’s white knuckled grip on Ami’s shirt loosened and her senshi dispersed only slightly.</p>
<p>Reports  came streaming into Ami’s computer, windows tiling on top of each other  in rapid succession. “Sunspot activity is ramping up dramatically.” She  barked. “We’re not alone in this. The other planets, especially those  closest to the Sun, are experiencing the same kinds of tremors and  more. Volcanism on Venus is turning their atmosphere sooty. A  planet-wide winter is a very real possibility there. Sandstorms on Mars  have nearly buried what few stationary cities they have. Mercury is…”  Ami paused momentarily and reread one of her reports with narrowed  eyes. “Mercury’s surface is being <em>scorched</em> by errant sunspots.”</p>
<p>“Anything  from the Earth?” Haruka avoided Serenity’s gaze and locked hazel eyes  on Minako. “That coward Beryl couldn’t even announce her attack?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.” The Venusian spat. “She won’t be far behind the youma. This attack will be just the first wave.”</p>
<p>Rei balled her hands into fists. “War has begun.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Serenity disliked it when her senshi felt the need to post a personal guard at her door.</p>
<p>She  disliked it even more when that guard was not one of her trusted  warriors, but an entire troop of the Moon’s army that had been assigned  to protect her.</p>
<p>’<em>Those guards should be aiding the rest of the  army, either guarding the Palace and its peoples or rushing out with  the rest of the army to help my senshi battle back the youma, not  standing uselessly outside my bedroom door.’</em></p>
<p>She clutched at a child in her arms. No longer an infant, Saturn had rapidly aged into a toddler, and had been left in her <em>protection</em>.</p>
<p>Serenity  snorted. She knew the excuse was a finely disguised ploy to keep her  from insisting that she be allowed to fight alongside her senshi. It  bothered her that regardless of the effort she’d thrown into training  both her mind and her body in order to help them protect everything she  held dear, she knew her guardians would never allow her to join them in  battle.</p>
<p>Still, Serenity found herself taking no small amount of  comfort in Saturn’s small, chubby hands that held a death grip on the  loose shoulders of her dress. The girl burbled incoherently with a wide  smile that boasted the tips of two small, white teeth that were just  beginning to cut through the toddler’s gums. The warmth of the child in  her arms was a small boon to ease the anxiety and fear Serenity felt  for the safety and welfare of each of her senshi, and the lives of the  thousands of warriors from the Moon and beyond who rushed to join them  in battle.</p>
<p>The Princess poured her nervous energy into the  entertainment of her young charge. Sitting with her legs crossed  underneath her, Serenity sank to the plush, carpeted floor and held the  child in her lap, letting the little girl face her. Those chubby  fingers tangled in Serenity’s long hair and gave a solid yank. The  Princess smiled indulgently and pulled her prized locks from sticky  fingers and tossed her long pigtails over her shoulder. Saturn pouted  at the older woman with dark, mournful eyes.</p>
<p>Serenity chuckled.  “And you would fight on behalf of us all?” Her voice was an astonished  whisper, but it silenced the small child who watched her attentively.</p>
<p>“I  would not have it be so.” The Princess brushed dark, feathered bangs  from Saturn’s forehead. “I would not have you fight while I hide under  the protection of my mother. I would fight as fiercely and as  passionately as my senshi… if not nearly as <em>well</em> as any of them.”</p>
<p>The  little girl in the Princess’ lap uttered an amused giggle, and she  toppled forward into Serenity’s chest where slim arms closed loosely  around her.</p>
<p>“You are too precious. I would fight in your stead, little Saturn.”</p>
<p>The toddler went still and pulled back from the Princess. An unreadable emotion swirled in her dark eyes.</p>
<p>“What?”  Serenity asked with a self conscious chuckle. “Little Saturn? Is that  it?” She asked leadingly. “Why, that doesn’t suit a beautiful little  child at all. What should we call you?”</p>
<p>Serenity placed a finger  to her chin and gave the thought ample consideration while examining  the bright little girl in her lap. Finally, a smile tugged at her lips.  Like a mirror image, the young girl mimicked the action.</p>
<p>“Hotaru.”  She said proudly. “I will call you Hotaru.” Serenity ruffled the girl’s  short, thick hair and pointed to herself. “Hotaru-chan, my name is  Serenity.”</p>
<p>Hotaru’s forehead scrunched and she bit at her bottom lip with her two small teeth. “Ser… Ser…”</p>
<p>The  Princess’ cobalt eyes went wide at the child’s attempt to speak. At  first she thought it was merely her over active imagination, but it  felt like the child in her lap was getting heavier<em>. ’Is she growing? Is she turning into the weapon she was born to be?’</em></p>
<p>“Ser… Sere…”</p>
<p>Serenity laughed brightly. “That’s okay. Just call me onee-chan, Hotaru. I’ll be your big sister.”</p>
<p>The child smiled widely. “Onee!” She exclaimed proudly.</p>
<p>Even  as the Princess of the Moon fought back traitorous tears and pulled  Saturn closer for a hug, she felt the girl’s body lengthen, caught in  the throes of a growth spurt, and Serenity found herself cursing both  their fates.</p>
<hr />
<p>A sailor teleport shared between the group of  eight senshi resulted in a minimal power drain, and despite the fact  that each of the women were ready and rearing to fight, they were  discouraged to find that the youma had made such progress away from the  pole.</p>
<p>As they had suspected, the enemy had taken the middle  ground to avoid coming over the tall mountains that bordered the Sea of  Serenity. They had traveled through Mares Frigoris and skirted through  the lowlands in between Plato Crater and the Montes Alpes. At this  point, as the monsters streamed into the low plains, all that separated  them from the Palace of the Moon Kingdom on the other side of the Sea  of Serenity was the weak point between Montes Apenninus and Montes  Caucasus, a sizable break in the mountain range that bordered the sea.</p>
<p>The  feat would have been simple for such a large force, and the Palace  would have been easy pickings had it not been for the eight women that  stood their ground across the mouth of the narrow pass.</p>
<p>The  constant rumbling that was the combined product of tens of thousands of  footfalls belonging to the heavy, cumbersome monsters rolled down off  the mountains. White clouds of frosty dust hung closely on the northern  horizon, stirred into the air by the youma. The first of their numbers  were already marching towards the break in the mountains.</p>
<p>With steely gazes, the senshi turned to one other.</p>
<p>“The Moon’s armies won’t be too far behind us.” Venus said plainly. “We should expect them to reinforce our offensive shortly.”</p>
<p>Uranus laughed heartily and gestured to the marching youma. “What, you think we can’t take care of this on our own?”</p>
<p>Mars nearly chuckled. “I rather <em>like</em> being the first line of defense.”</p>
<p>Jupiter cracked her knuckles. Electricity nearly flowed off of her in visible waves. “You and me both.” She growled.</p>
<p>“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Pluto warned, “The consequences would be disastrous.”</p>
<p>“Team  up,” Venus instructed, “Fight smart, and don’t stray too far. This  shouldn’t be too far removed from our past encounters with these  things.” The leader of the senshi drew a line in the fine silt of the  dusty ground. “We attack anything we can, guarding the area around the  pass. When the Moon’s army arrives, they’ll reinforce us on all sides  and help us to drive the youma back until we can more easily protect  the pass. The more of them we take out, the better the odds become once  our armies show up.”</p>
<p>“The youma have noted our arrival, but they  aren’t slowing down.” Mercury said coldly. She dismissed the blue visor  that had shielded her eyes as the youma streamed into the low plains.  They were still several kilometers away, but their numbers were forming  a solid wall of enemies that flowed across the land.</p>
<p>Neptune examined the threat with her mirror. “Don’t forget their weak points. Aim to kill, and then kill the next.”</p>
<p>The Uranian turned towards her partner and cracked a toothy grin. “I <em>love</em> it when you talk battle, Michiru.”</p>
<p>Venus huffed loudly, disturbing her golden bangs. “<em>Honestly</em>,” she joked, “maybe you two should be split up.”</p>
<p>Uranus smiled broadly and slapped the golden warrior on the shoulder. “Are you ready to lead this charge?”</p>
<p>The  Venusian nodded and winked, and together, the inner senshi and the  outer senshi sprinted forward across the open plains to meet the youma  threat head on.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>A sea of beady red eyes and brown,  lumbering bodies, the front lines of the monsters never even slowed  down as the senshi attacks hit their first ranks. Elemental blasts  slammed into the first lines of marching youma, and at least a hundred  of the creatures were taken out instantly. They seemed unsurprised by  the sudden offensive, and ignored the threat, marching forward, always  forward, stomping over the dying bodies and slaughtered remains of  their fallen brethren until they met the senshi resistance and were  forced to fight in closer combat.</p>
<p>Venus and Mars were one hundred  percent murderous intent, and when they combined their attacks,  throwing light and flame in the form of long range weapons, the two  fierce women could easily fell a dozen youma at a time. When pressed  against each other, back to back in close range combat, they were no  less deadly and effective, executing tireless hand to hand combat  techniques with swords and elemental weapons, slaying and slaughtering  as they went.</p>
<p>Mercury and Jupiter were also a formidable pair;  what Mercury lacked in strength, she made up for with strategy, and  when paired with her partner, the two could effectively wipe out just  as many of the snarling, slobbering monsters with a combination of  brute force on behalf of the tall Jovian, and careful aim on behalf of  the small Mercurian.</p>
<p>The outer senshi fought as a three man team.  Their advanced techniques, compliments of their powerful talismans,  produced attacks that, when properly coordinated, could fell nearly  twice as many youma at once as the inners combined. The Uranian’s brash  recklessness and sheer power and strength produced deadly effective  close range attacks and it was all the Neptunian could do to keep an  eye out to make sure Uranus didn’t get overwhelmed, and would send wide  ranged water based attacks to drown any number of youma who dared to  get too close to her partner. Although her staff was exceptionally  efficient in close range combat, Pluto also possessed a long range  attack, which, at her whispered command, would slam into the ranks of  youma and eliminate a dozen of the disgusting monsters at once.</p>
<p>But  for all their bravado and initial cry for war, twenty minutes into the  fighting, even the senshi were beginning to tire. They couldn’t hope to  push back the youma horde on their own; the odds were simply stacked  against them. For every monster they slaughtered, three more took its  place. The creatures surged over the corpses of their dead heedlessly,  constantly attacking the senshi with fresh bodies, and it was all the  warriors of the Moon Kingdom could do hold their ground.</p>
<p>Attacks became sloppy. Elemental powers weakened. Morale plummeted.</p>
<p>A  set of claws raked across Venus’ upper left arm and chest, even as she  plunged her sword through a youma skull. She hadn’t the time to staunch  the bleeding, for another monster was coming at her. She stole a glance  at her partner. Mars’s right thigh was torn open and she sported an  ugly gash above her right eye. Blood was dripping into the socket, but  it didn’t seem to affect her as she pressed fiery hands to the rough  skin of one of Metallia’s minions and ignited its body into flame.</p>
<p>Satisfied  that her second in command was all right, all things considered, Venus  performed a visual on the rest of her warriors and the outer senshi as  well, even as she choked her newest attacker with the scalding light of  her love me chain. The others fared equally as bad as she and her  partner. They all bore the wounds of battle, and all their performance  was suffering in the face of exhaustion.</p>
<p>It was a horn that  grabbed Venus’ attention. A strange thing to hear amid the sea of the  pulsing bodies of the enemy and the blasts of the senshi’s elemental  attacks, but it was a sound that reminded her of home; a Venusian  battlecry. And if she listened closely enough, she could hear the  steady beating of foreign drums on the horizon.</p>
<p>Her hands tingled  as she electrocuted yet another youma, and Jupiter went stock-still.  She shot her eyes to her leader. “The drums!” she exclaimed, “Jupiter’s  army!”</p>
<p>Mars pressed her back to Venus’ and the two women battled  four youma who rushed them simultaneously. All four were all dispatched  in the blink of an eye. The golden warrior almost laughed. “And Venus’  too! Reinforcements are on the way!”</p>
<p>Through the pass that stood  in the weak point between Montes Apenninus and Montes Caucasus that the  senshi guarded, a colorful and diverse combination of many armies ran  with reckless abandon to aide the eight warriors. The senshi soon found  themselves flanked on all sides by fresh, able bodied warriors, and the  troops’ enthusiasm and vigor only helped to recharge them and spur them  to fight harder.</p>
<p>Sudden, powerful, long range attacks consisting  of explosive, laser guided projectiles were compliments of the small  force Mercury had been able to spare, but what they lacked in numbers,  their weapons could annihilate untold numbers of the monsters. They  aimed for the back ranks to avoid hitting any of the other warriors  with friendly fire.</p>
<p>Not to be one-upped, Venus had sent a small  cavalry, and bare chested, tanned warriors on tall, white horses  charged into the youma ranks with swords raised and horns blowing.  Jupiter boasted a sizable force, and their long haired, leather and  metal clad warriors jumped into the fray alongside the senshi, swinging  spears and swords, fearless in the face of the hideous enemy. What  little force Mars had been able to spare joined their savage brethren.  Clad in their desert robes, these warriors resembled banshees as they  dodged and twirled with double swords and deadly intent.</p>
<p>Uranus  had sent many warriors. Light on foot but heavy on strength, these  fighters were ruthless and methodical, constantly forging forward in  controlled formations. From afar, Neptune’s archers sent volleys of  arrows into hostile territory, far away from the united warriors of the  Moon Kingdom, and their seers were doubtlessly assisting the Moon’s  tacticians.</p>
<p>The last to arrive, but by far the largest in number,  the army of the Moon poured through the pass. Resplendent in silver  trimmed, white uniforms, for all their impeccable appearance, these  warriors were deadly fighters who attacked tirelessly with precision  and fine tuned strength.</p>
<p>Slowly, the tides were turned. The youma  were pushed back, further and further away from the heavily guarded  pass. The armies of the Moon Kingdom, led by the eight senshi,  advanced. Hope shone brightly.</p>
<p>But then, a horn blared, differing  in it’s pitch than the one before it. Venus looked up. This was no  battlecry. “No,” she whispered, trusting Mars to pick up her slack  while she stood tall to get a better view of the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Minako?” Mars questioned, as she effortlessly slaughtered a youma who hadn’t retreated fast enough.</p>
<p>“Reinforcements.” The golden warrior said detachedly.</p>
<p>The Martian looked behind her. “We don’t <em>need</em> more reinforcements.”</p>
<p>“No,” the Venusian shook her head, <em>“Humans.” </em>She spat.</p>
<p>Mars  sliced through the neck of another monster and sank her heel into its  gut, dropping it to the ground before she could follow Venus’ haunted  eyes.</p>
<p>Her bitter curse fell to the commotion that surrounded her.</p>
<p>On  the horizon, fresh reinforcements of human warriors were streaming  through the lowlands, following the same path the youma had taken.  Black uniforms and silver armor glinted dully in the dust filtered  sunlight, and this army wasted no time in joining the ranks of  monsters, eagerly fighting along side them.</p>
<p>The united forces of  the Moon Kingdom raised the alarm and as new swords joined the battle,  the forward momentum on behalf of the warriors of the Moon slowed, and  then halted all together. The Earthlings fought with a wild, seemingly  untrained ferocity, but what the warriors of the Moon had in training  and experience, the humans had in numbers and energy.</p>
<p>Human  corpses began to mingle with both the fallen youma and members of the  inter-planetary army, but as the battle waged on, it became quickly  apparent that the two forces were at an impasse. Stuck in a stalemate,  the battle raged for hours, blow being met by blow, parry for parry,  casualty for casualty, and finally, the front line was a sea of corpses  that blocked the path of further warriors.</p>
<p>By the mutual terms of  war, both sides of the warring factions slowly ground to a halt and the  exhausted warriors took a break from the warfare. An uneasy front was  established and the two opposing armies set up camp on either side of  the line.</p>
<hr />
<p>The senshi limped their way back through the Palace.</p>
<p>They  had resented having to leave the battlefield, they had felt guilty to  return to the comforts of the castle, but their main responsibility was  to their Princess. At the very least, they felt confident that the two  armies that were pitted against each other were fairly equally matched  and were eased that they weren’t abandoning their forces in a time of  need.</p>
<p>Sickbay had done its duty for the eight women. Some  injuries took longer to set and stitch than others, but finally, the  senshi had been released, and now, they were all due to the Princess’  chambers. The troops that had been posted there would need to be  relieved, and Serenity - both the Queen and Princess - needed to be  briefed, preferably, the later with as little information as possible.  Only then could the weary warriors hope for a night of rest to heal  their many wounds.</p>
<p>The senshi headed for the Princess’ quarters.  As they walked, Minako stole sidelong glances at the outer senshi. They  were frequently a stoic threesome, but there was just <em>something</em> that unnerved the golden warrior about the eerily calm silence they had  adopted since leaving that gruesome battlefield several hours earlier.</p>
<p>Minako dismissed the guards outside Serenity’s private suite. With a clammy hand, she turned the knob of the heavy door.</p>
<p>A  dark haired little girl no younger than four or five paused in the  middle of her sprint across the room, distracted by the interruption.  Minako was only half surprised, but completely frightened, to  understand that she was looking at Saturn.</p>
<p>In fact, it was her  Princess who caught her rather more off guard. Too focused to have  noticed that the door had opened, the blonde woman caught the girl’s  small form in her arms with a lively giggle. “I caught you,  Hotaru-chan!”</p>
<p>“Onee-chan,” the little girl said tentatively, pointing to the eight women who had stepped through the threshold.</p>
<p>Serenity  offered her friends and guardians a weak smile but did not apologize  for her childishness. Instead, she stood tall, maintaining her hold on  Hotaru.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad to see you all back safe and sound.” She  said quietly, and her shoulders slumped, as though a great weight had  been lifted off of them.</p>
<p>Minako smiled indulgently and approached  her Princess, dropping to a knee before Serenity and the little girl.  “Are you Saturn’s big sister now?” She teased lightly.</p>
<p>“I am.” Serenity said matter of factly. “And her name is Hotaru-chan. There’s no need to be so formal, is there?”</p>
<p>Setsuna  frowned. Minako saw it from the corner of her eye and it struck her as  odd from the normally expressionless woman. A deep green light  enveloped the tall woman and Pluto stood in Setsuna’s wake. She  advanced forward. Makoto and Rei both clenched their fists and edged  closer to their Princess. Pluto shouldn’t have been a threat, but there  was something unnerving about the situation.</p>
<p>Pluto took note of  the sudden hostility and paused several paces away from Serenity and  the child. She sank to a knee and turned blank, garnet eyes to the dark  haired girl.</p>
<p>“Come, Saturn,” she said quietly, “The time for your training is at hand.”</p>
<p>The  dark eyed child looked to Pluto with no small amount of trepidation.  Her small fingers clutched the shoulders of her big sister’s dress.</p>
<p>“Train her?” Serenity asked. “She has only learned how to run. How would she fight alongside the likes of you?”</p>
<p>A  ghost of a smile touched Pluto’s lips. “She is not far from finding the  strength to lift her glaive. That is all we require of her.”</p>
<p>“And once she can lift this glaive, what then?”</p>
<p>Pluto leveled Serenity with a cold gaze. “Then, she will be sent to Earth, where she will destroy the planet and resurrect it.”</p>
<p>Something  inside of the Princess snapped. Holding Hotaru to her, she stood  defiantly. The child clutched onto her tightly. “You would <em>destroy</em> a planet? You would send a <em>child</em> to do something so terrible?”</p>
<p>Pluto looked as though she would have recourse, but Serenity wouldn’t allow it. “I’ve lost the man I <em>love</em> to the evil that resides there, and I would still not condemn an entire planet to <em>death</em>, not even to banish the darkness.”</p>
<p>Serenity’s voice lowered into an angry hiss. “Your plan is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>“Then what would you propose?” Pluto asked calmly.</p>
<p>“I’ll fight in her stead.”</p>
<p>“Impossible.” Haruka snarled.</p>
<p>“Then <em>tell me</em>,” Serenity’s fingers rubbed the child’s back as she challenged each of the outer senshi, “What of Hotaru-chan? What would <em>she</em> want?</p>
<p>Pluto took a careful step forward. “Her name is <em>Saturn, </em>Princess, and what she wants is irrelevant. She will sacrifice herself just by invoking her powers.”</p>
<p>Finally  understanding what hadn’t been said in previous conversations about  Saturn’s powers, Serenity pulled Hotaru impossibly closer to her. “You  mean, the penalty for unleashing her power is <em>death!?</em>”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Haruka  and Michiru turned away from Pluto’s stoic profile, their gazes cast to  the floor. Serenity blanched. They had known, they had <em>known</em> and were still willing to send this innocent child to her death. The  only small consolation she could lean on was that her inner senshi were  equally shocked by the proposition.</p>
<p>“I will <em>not</em> allow this.” Serenity hissed.</p>
<p>“Serenity!  That is enough!” Queen Serenity paused at the door before entering the  room. Despite any personal feelings on the subject, each of the senshi  found themselves dropping to a knee in reverence, save for Pluto.  Serenity approached her daughter with recourse in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>“You <em>will</em> yield to Pluto’s decision.” She commanded. “This situation is out of  your hands and you do not understand what else is at stake.”</p>
<p>As  though she’d been slapped across the face, the younger Serenity’s jaw  hung slack. All the anger and defiance she harbored drained from her  body to see her mother take such firm initiative. Hotaru slipped from  her hold and the young girl found her footing on shaky legs.</p>
<p>The  child looked up to her big sister with uncertain eyes, and then looked  to the calm expression of the one called Pluto. Her wide eyes bounced  between the two women for some time. Pluto held her hand out towards  the child and nodded. Hotaru’s dark gaze darkened then, and finally,  she slowly moved to join the outer senshi, taking careful, measured  steps that made her seem much older than she really was. She took her  place next to Pluto’s side quietly.</p>
<p>“Saturn and I will leave.”  Pluto said quietly. “We will be out of touch for the duration of the  next day while Saturn is trained and briefed on her mission.”</p>
<p>In  the numb silence that followed, the Queen nodded at her long time  friend. Sailor Pluto vanished into thin air, and with her, Saturn. She  looked at the empty space left in their wake longingly, and then took  stock of her daughter’s guardians.</p>
<p>“Rise.” She commanded. “Venus, you were sent here to brief Serenity and I. Please go ahead.”</p>
<p>With  a shaky voice, Minako found herself offering her Queen her report. It  fell on mostly deaf ears. The Queen already knew what had transpired on  the field of battle, and the Princess was too distraught to really  listen. She’d barely finished her briefing when a flustered aide swung  the room’s heavy door open and poked his blonde head into the chamber.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The Queen said sharply.</p>
<p>“On the comm.,” he said uncertainly. “A message from the Earth.”</p>
<p>The  women rose to their feet on unsteady legs. Perhaps because the action  was technical in nature, Ami seemed to be the only one among the senshi  capable of movement. She battled her shock and shyness and headed to  the communications center on the far wall of Serenity’s antechamber. A  semi-transparent screen projected from an opposite wall came to life  before the women, and it was Beryl’s cold face that blinked into  existence.</p>
<p>“So good to see you again.” The Queen of the Earth  said with a false, lilting voice. She directed her amused gaze to the  elder Serenity. “What a pleasure to finally meet your acquaintance,  Queen Serenity. I am Queen Beryl, and <em>this,</em>”</p>
<p>The camera panned back then, and next to her throne stood the familiar visage of a dark haired man. “This is <em>King</em> Endymion.”</p>
<p>“Endymion!”  Pushing past her senshi, Serenity lunged forward, her hand ghosting  through the incorporeal image of her lover’s projection.</p>
<p>Beryl’s head tipped back, her red hair spilling over her shoulders, She laughed heartily. “He can’t <em>hear</em> you, little Princess. He can only hear <em>me</em>. He can only see <em>me</em>. I am all that resides in his world.”</p>
<p>His  eyes dark, his expression vacant, Endymion sank to his knees, bowing  next to Beryl’s throne. The Queen petted his tussled hair in a familiar  gesture.</p>
<p>Insult on top of injury was enough for Princess  Serenity. After having Hotaru stripped from her, and to be shown the  fate of her lover, the woman effectively shut down. Her small hands  trembled. Her arms wrapped around her chest. Her legs might have given  out beneath her had Makoto not rushed forward and caught the woman,  pulling her safely to sit in a nearby chair.</p>
<p>Beryl then dismissed  the Princess and focused on the senshi. “I see you’ve lead the charge  against my minions. I must admit, you’ve done better than I expected.”</p>
<p>Minako smirked. “You didn’t plan on sending your human lackeys out so soon, now did you?”</p>
<p>The  Queen of the Earth frowned and her expression belied her words. “With  the strength and power Metallia has imbued in me, I don’t <em>need</em> an army to bring the Moon Kingdom down.” She chuckled slightly, “But they <em>are</em> effective to keep most of your soldiers at bay.”</p>
<p>“Don’t think we don’t have plenty more troops to guard our Palace.” Minako barked. “And you’ll <em>never</em> get past <em>us</em>.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see about that.” Beryl snorted and then turned an antagonistic grin towards the golden warrior. “You’re so <em>saucy</em>,  Venus. I always did like that about you. Perhaps I can still get you  and your little pet to defect together. The two of you would make an <em>excellent</em> addition to my forces.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather <em>die</em> than serve you, you <em>witch</em>.”</p>
<p>Beryl chuckled amusedly. “Be careful what you wish for, little girl.”</p>
<p>Minako  sucked in an indignant breath and her fingernails nipped the soft flesh  of her palm, but her riposte was halted. Rei laid a warning hand on her  shoulder. Queen Serenity motioned for Ami to cut the communication. The  screen winked out of existence, but somehow, Beryl’s gravelly laugh  continued to roll around the room.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of her  mind, Serenity was vaguely aware of her mother dismissing her senshi.  At one point, she was fairly certain that Minako stopped, sat next to  her, and clasped her hands in her own. She said something to her, but  Serenity couldn’t remember what it was. Her mother cast sad eyes in her  direction before closing her door behind her with a quiet click.</p>
<p>And  then, she was alone. Completely and totally alone. And the last little  piece of herself, that last little shred of hope that Serenity  harbored, shattered into a million pieces and she fell, sobbing, to the  floor.</p>

<p>Author’s Notes:</p>
<p>This is probably the most  action-filled chapter I’ve ever written, and things really aren’t going  to slow down from here. I hope everyone enjoyed it. Please review!</p>
<p>Special Thanks:</p>
<p>Sporadic:  Sharing customs and differences in cultures is one of the great lures  of writing in the Sil Mil timeline. You should try it. You know, in  addition to all those other stories you’re working on. :)<br />
  Neuro:  Interesting that the ritual’s been your favorite scene in ASV. I think  my favorite scene was the whole of Chapter 1. Nothing has seemed to  match it for me.<br />
  Bomichan: What you got out of the ritual scene was  exactly what I did while writing it. Thanks for letting me know that I  hit the nail on the head.<br />
  Sammich: Moar fanartz! I tried so hard to  draw my own interpretation of the Martian ritual from the last chapter.  I failed utterly.<br />
  1010’jin: If you think <em>this</em> is heavy, wait  until you see my PGSM Sil Mil fic. Regardless, I’m honored that you  like this so much, despite the dark feel to it.<br />
  Mels: Ah, Mels. Your review was “v. cool and sophisticated.” <em>Yes</em>. I did read your earlier work and I laughed all the way through it in the best way possible. It was a hilarious read.<br />
  Disclaimed: Thank you kindly! Your review reinforced what I’ve been hoping to achieve. I appreciate it.<br />
  Strangeness:  You must have spent days reading to catch up between the two stories,  so thank you for your time, and for your review.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>Preview, Chapter 19: Don’t Hesitate</p>
<p>The  time for tears had come and gone. Michiru’s eyes were red but dry.  Haruka wore a warrior’s expression of the calm before the storm. The  two clung to each other in the room’s darkness. Somehow, they couldn’t  fight the sense that their feelings for each other were the only thing  in the universe that still made sense.</p>
<p>“You know that if Beryl  attacks tomorrow, Pluto’s plan may well fail.” The Uranian’s voice was  devoid of emotion. “She’s taken Saturn to train for the final battle,  but if Metallia is here on the Moon, then having Saturn destroy the  Earth won’t help us at all.”</p>
<p>The Neptunian’s hand balled into a  fist, curled tightly between their bodies. “If they hadn’t entered  another dimension, we could have contacted Setsuna to tell her that  Beryl might attack sooner than we’d thought. We didn’t plan for this.”</p>
<p>“Saturn’s use may be delayed.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”  Haruka paused, and was momentarily on the edge between two entirely  different outcomes. Finally, her eyes hardened and her lips formed a  thin, white line. “You can’t second guess this. It wasn’t our decision  to make, anyway. Not really.”</p>
<p>Michiru propped herself up on an elbow. Her cheeks were flushed with defiance. “But she’s just a <em>child</em>, Haruka! We can’t just send her off to <em>die</em>!”</p>
<p>“She’s a <em>weapon</em>, Michiru, a <em>weapon</em>! And if she won’t die destroying the Earth, then she’ll die destroying the Moon. Which would you prefer?”</p>
<p>Tears  threatened Michiru’s reddened eyes and she stifled a sob. Her arm gave  out and she found solace in the hollow of Haruka’s neck. Even her  partner’s tender reassurance and soft strokes along her back did little  to ease her fears.</p>
<p>When she could find it once more, Michiru’s  voice was a whisper. “Why do I get the feeling that we’ll be long dead  by the time that decision gets made?”</p>
<p>Haruka didn’t have an answer for her.</p>
