<h1>Child of Saturn (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ladymeg.html">Lady Meg</a><br> </h2>
<pre>In the darkest part of the night, Hotaru disentangled herself from the 
warmth of the bed and Minako&#39;s embrace.  She rose quietly, gazing with 
fondness at her lover&#39;s sleeping face.  With the moonlight caressing 
her skin, Minako looked to be the perfect vision of an angel.  
Hotaru&#39;s fingers longed to caress the fair cheeks and silky tresses, 
but she carefully stilled the urge.  There would be time for that 
later, but for now she had work to do.  Placing a gentle kiss on 
Minako&#39;s brow, Hotaru withdrew...

...and emerged from the room as Sailor Saturn.  Her glaive cradled in 
the crook of her arm, she walked the empty halls.  Though the world 
was at peace, the senshi were careful never to let their guard down.  
One of them was always patrolling the palace and watching the city and 
surrounding areas for signs of evil forces or strange energy signs.  
Saturn&#39;s watch happened to be in the middle of the night, but she 
didn&#39;t mind.  It suited her.  She loved the way her footsteps echoed 
on the polished floor, and she found the sleepy silence that unnerved 
most people had a soothing effect on her.

Yet tonight her mood seemed determined to be melancholy.  Emerging 
onto a balcony, Saturn leapt nimbly to the top of a tall tower.  From 
the roof of this particular building, she could see out across most of 
Crystal Tokyo.  Of course, there was nothing amiss.  There rarely was, 
these days.  No senshi would ever think of skimping on her duties, but 
lately Saturn found herself feeling...useless.

Was this how she would be spending her very long life, playing 
watchdog to a city with no rats?  A gentle breeze ruffled through her 
hair, completing the sad mental picture she painted of herself: a 
lonely soldier standing guard in the cold darkness.

Shivering at her own imagery, Saturn turned her thoughts to more 
pleasant things.  Like Aino Minako, her lover.  Sailor Venus.  As she 
had many nights, she brought Minako&#39;s face to her mind, endeavoring to 
recall every detail to perfection.  A smile curled at the edges of her 
lips as her imaginary Minako tossed her a quirky smile, winking and 
blowing a kiss before she vanished in a shower of golden light.  Yes, 
she should think of her life as the many years she would have to spend 
in happiness with the one person who made it worth living.

Later, as her shift drew to a close, she returned to the palace with a 
much lightened mood.  Approaching the grand hallways that lead to her 
rooms, her expression became serious.  With the approach of morning, 
the formerly empty halls were bustling with life.  She faced the 
chattering palace staff, servants, and minor nobility as if they were 
the deadliest gauntlet.

Just make it back to the room, she told herself grimly, as she did 
every morning.  Shouldering her glaive, she stepped forward...

..into silence.  As if she were surrounded by a soundless bubble, all 
voices within a few feet of her fell quiet.  Wide eyes stared at her 
from countless faces as she walked calmly past, her gaze focused at a 
point somewhere in the distance.  And then, after she had safely 
passed, the whispers began.

&quot;The Senshi of Destruction,&quot; murmured a voice filled with fearful awe.

&quot;Don&#39;t! She&#39;ll hear you!&quot; someone else hissed.  &quot;She&#39;ll put a curse on 
us all!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s so small, so pale...she looks sickly.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the one who captured the heart of our dear Sailor Venus?&quot;

&quot;What do they allow the Senshi of Destruction to stay here?&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t need someone like HER!&quot;

The barbs were small, but each one drove the icy spike a bit further 
into Saturn&#39;s heart.  Day after day, the whispers always awaited her 
when she returned from guard duty.  One would think after so many 
years people would have grown used to her presence, but nothing ever 
changed.  Walking through that hall after a long, lonely night felt a 
little harder every day.  The only reason she made it through was that 
she knew Minako waited at the other end.  Love waited.  Her heart 
waited to take away her pain.

Finally reaching her rooms, she all but ran inside.  Her 
transformation melted away as she pushed the heavy door shut, leaning 
against it while she regained control of her emotions.  And then, as 
always, her eyes fell upon Minako.

Her hair tousled from sleep, one arm flung haphazardly across the 
pillows, Minako still looked like the most beautiful thing Hotaru had 
ever seen.  With the dawn not yet arrived, the light illuminating the 
room was in soft, pastel shades.

I feel like an ink spot compared to her, Hotaru thought with a wry 
smile.  Easing herself onto the bed, she stroked her love&#39;s cheek with 
gentle fingertips and pressed a soft kiss to her lips.  As she drew 
back, Minako&#39;s eyes fluttered open, brilliant blue focusing on deep 
violet.  &quot;Hotaru-chan,&quot; she whispered sleepily, and Hotaru instantly 
felt as if the incidents in the hallway were no more than trivial 
nonsense.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Hotaru said quietly, running her fingers through the 
long blonde locks, &quot;Minako-chan.&quot;

A smile lit Minako&#39;s face and she pulled her gentle lover close, their 
lips meeting again but this time with unbridled passion.  The sun 
broke over the horizon, casting golden light over the couple.  As 
always, they failed to notice the advent of a new day.

And as always, Sailor Venus was a little late for her shift.

----------

Hotaru was still drifting in a peaceful slumber when the sound of a 
door crashing open startled her violently awake.  Sailor Venus stood 
in the doorway, red-faced and out of breath.

&quot;M-Minako-chan?!&quot;  Disoriented from the rude awakening, Hotaru threw 
back the covers and stumbled across the room where the exhausted 
senshi fell into her arms, clinging to her tightly.  &quot;Minako-chan! 
What&#39;s wrong?!&quot;  Her voice sounded slightly hysterical.  The senshi&#39;s 
shoulders were shaking.  Was she crying?

Venus raised her head and Hotaru gasped.  There were tears in her eyes 
but the expression on her face was one of joy.  &quot;Oh Hotaru-chan, it&#39;s 
so wonderful! Serenity is pregnant!&quot;  She hugged Hotaru tightly.  
&quot;We&#39;ll finally get to see Chibiusa...no, Small Lady...again!&quot;

Hotaru sat stunned, from relief that the news was good, not bad, and 
from the overwhelming emotions that Chibiusa&#39;s name evoked.  
&quot;Chibiusa-chan,&quot; she murmured into Minako&#39;s hair.  &quot;I haven&#39;t thought 
of her in...so long...&quot;  She was my only friend back then, Hotaru 
remembered, the only one who saw me as a normal person and not some 
kind of freak.  Pulling free of Venus, Hotaru stood.  Her 
transformation enveloped her as Venus looked up.

&quot;Sailor Saturn?&quot;

Saturn smiled, holding out a hand to her lover.  &quot;I&#39;d like to go 
congratulate the queen in person.  Come with me?&quot;  Returning the 
smile, Venus grabbed Saturn&#39;s hand and all but dragged her out of the 
room, chattering brightly about old memories of Chibiusa as she 
hurried Saturn towards the royal throne room.  A wistful smile on her 
face, Saturn allowed herself to be led.  She wished she had Minako&#39;s 
confidence.  Nobody ever whispered about Sailor Venus.  Nobody ever 
thought poorly of the Senshi of Love.

They reached the throne room and Venus swept Saturn inside.  The large 
room was already filled with well-wishers, as the news of the queen&#39;s 
pregnancy had spread quickly.  Ushering Saturn to the front of the 
room, Venus knelt before the throne.  Hotaru followed suit, and then 
raised her eyes to stare at the beautiful queen.  Serenity was perched 
delicately on her crystal throne, her cheeks flushed prettily from all 
the attention.  Endymion sat beside her, one hand on her arm, looking 
more proud than she had ever seen him.

&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; Saturn began, her low voice somehow carrying through 
the background chatter of the large room, &quot;Sailor Venus just informed 
me of the good news.  I...know your child will grow to be a kind 
person who sees into the hearts of others.  I wish you well with your 
pregnancy.&quot;  For a moment, her eyes met the gentle blue of the 
queen&#39;s.

&quot;Thank you, Sailor Saturn,&quot; Serenity in her sweet, gentle voice.  &quot;I 
understand.&quot;  Beside her, Endymion nodded his approval, and Venus 
winked at her.  They could not let everyone know that they had already 
met the child Serenity was carrying.

----------

The nine months that followed were a whirlwind of celebrations, 
counting down until the day that Chibiusa was expected to arrive.  In 
all the excitement, nobody noticed that one senshi looked a little bit 
less happy.  Especially as that particular senshi wasn&#39;t known for 
being overly joyful to begin with.  Not even her closest friend and 
lover noticed the changes at first.

But of course, nothing about Hotaru could escape the attention of Aino 
Minako for long.

Author&#146;s Note: Senshi Transformations
I know that many people think that the senshi will no longer transform 
in the future, that they will simply BE senshi.  What I&#146;m doing isn&#146;t 
really all that different.  The public only knows the senshi as the 
senshi.  But to other senshi, family members, and maybe a few very 
close friends, they still fall back on their old human names.  The 
transformations are more an act of changing clothes than really 
&#145;transforming&#146;.  I did this to distinguish the more personal level 
that Hotaru and Minako (as well as the other senshi) share.
