<h2>Mousetrap</h2>
<p>Dawn came to the Joketsuzoku village and found Ranma  awake.  He was setting on a rooftop  overlooking the site of the battle and trying to forget what the day was going  to bring.<p>
  He’d come back to himself last night as Ke Lun was  asking for volunteers to assault the Musk fortress, claiming that the Musk were  known to possess an artifact that would allow the cursed girls to resume their  normal forms.  It had been unanimous,  even Kuno forgoing his usual flowery speech to agree.<p>
  Indeed, he’d been unusually quiet since yesterday,  absorbed in his own thoughts.<p>
  Ranma really couldn’t blame him.  Yesterday had been disturbing for him too,  and he couldn’t even remember the fight from the point he went Neko.<p>
  “Is not easy face death.”  A quiet voice said from behind.  “This Shan Pu knows.”<p>
  Ranma turned to see the Amazon girl as she sat down  next to him.  He shook his head.  “No.  I  keep thinking I should have done something different.  I know there’s only one that I’m sure I  wounded badly, and that he deserved it, and that if I hadn’t he would have kept  killing defenseless girls, but still...”<p>
  “Ai Ren should not torture self.”<p>
  “I just feel I should have found a different way.  I’m a martial arts master, I should have been  able to control my anger and not cripple him.”  <p>
  Shan Pu sighed.   “Ai Ren save many others from death.   Ai Ren not have choice.  Amazon  only kill when must, not revel in death, but do not regret when must hurt, even  kill.  If law demand, honor demand,  justice demand, will kill, like step on insect.   Is done and forget.”<p>
  Ranma shook his head. “I can’t Shan Pu.  At the very least I crippled him.”<p>
  Shan Pu sighed.   “Sister say would be like this. Is why she tells Shan Pu come.”<p>
  Ranma laughed ruefully. “I should have known. I  thought she was recuperating.”<p>
  “She meditates. Rebuild chi for today.”<p>
  “She’s not coming along?”<p>
  “Great-grandmother tries to say no. Zhu Shu not  listens. She blames self for Akane be cursed.”<p>
  “Oh for Kami’s Sake! How can she think that’s her  fault?”<p>
  Shan Pu shrugged. “Is only blood-sister. Not always  understand.”<p>
  “Great. One more thing to worry about. Akane refused  to stay either.”<p>
  Shan Pu tilted her head. “Why would wish? Ai Ren is  warrior good as Shan Pu.”<p>
  Ranma sighed. “Then I suppose it would be pointless to  ask you to stay here too?”<p>
  Shan Pu stiffened. “Why would Ai Ren insult Shan Pu  so?” She asked with a glint in her eye.<p>
  Not looking at her, Ranma missed it. “I’m not  insulting you. It’s just that I can’t protect all of-“<p>
  A bon buri impacting the back of his head interrupted  him and knocked him off the roof.<p>
  “Shan Pu defends self! Shan Pu Champion! How- how-“  Anger gave way to tears as she turned and ran off.<p>
  “Now what did I do?” Ranma muttered to himself as he  stood up, rubbing the back of his head. He turned to see Akane standing in the  door of the hut and tapping her fingers on her crossed arms, her long pink ears  quivering.<p>
  “You would think you’d get the hint when I said no.”  She turned and stormed back into the hut.<p>
  Ranma sighed. “Women. I just don’t understand them.”<p>
  “Women are easy to handle, Son. You just have to be  firm with them.” Genma said as he came out of the hut. “Just look at how I told  your mother I was taking you off to be trained. Just tell them what to do and  that’s the end of it.”<p>
  Ranma booted him to the far side of the village. “And  that’s why you had to make a promise I’d commit seppuku if you failed!” he  yelled after the departing form.<p>
  “Ranma! You really shouldn’t kick you father across  the village.” Nodoka said, emerging from the hut behind Genma. “Boot him over  the wall. It’s impolite to have him possibly crash into someone’s house, or  land on someone.”<p>
  Ranma sighed... Looked like it was going to be one of  those days...</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>Several hours later they stood overlooking a pass into  a mountaintop valley.<p>
  “I don’t like it.” Ke Lun said, surveying the empty  pass. “They should have guards here at least. It’s almost like they want us to  walk right in.”<p>
  “Nay. We beat the blackguards so soundly they do cower  like whipped curs before the might of Blue Thunder.” Kuno said as he flourished  his sword.<p>
  “Yeah, right Kuno.” Ranma said.<p>
  “It’s obviously a trap.” Tao-Ching said. “The question  is do we spring it or look for another way?”<p>
  Ke Lun pointed across the small valley to a fortress  built atop the mountain’s crest. “This <em>is</em> the only way. The far side of that crag is a sheer drop of a couple of thousand  feet. That stairway is the only access to the fortress.” She pointed to a  narrow stair that wound its way up to the small plateau the castle was built  on. Barely a hundred feet of open ground stood before the fortified gates.<p>
  Tao-Ching’s eyes narrowed. “That area before the gates  looks rather sandblasted. I’d say they’ve been using it for a helicopter  landing.”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “That would explain how Scorpion  brought in so many troops without our scouts seeing them. I wonder what made  Herb desperate enough to think he could trust them.”<p>
  Tao-Ching cracked his knuckles. “Doesn’t really matter  does it?”<p>
  Ke Lun’s ears twitched. “No, I suppose not.”<p>
  She looked over the group, her twenty rabbit-eared  Amazons and the group from Nerima, and mentally ticked off assets. “Tao-Ching.  You take Soun, Genma, Kuno, Tal Cum, Pow Der, Blu She and Loo Fah. You’re going  straight in through the gates. Shan Pu, Akane, Ranma, Zhu Shu and I will go for  the roof. The rest of you will surround the castle and prevent anyone from  escaping.” She glared at the couple of groans. “I brought you because you’re  our best archers, so stay where you’re the most useful. I’m sure we’ll send out  plenty of targets.”<p>
  Fea Tha, a tall willowy Amazon with blue hair smacked  the two groaners in the back of the head. “I’ll see you both for practice for  the next six months,” she said ominously. Ke Lun nodded.<p>
  Ranma started to open his mouth when Zhu Shu raised  her hand up to him. “No ask, Ranma. Know you think be noble to protect fiancée,  but not now. Shan Pu will forgive for ask this morning, but not make same  mistake twice.” She said, her voice too low to carry to the rest.<p>
  “But-“<p>
  “No, Ranma. If say one more word, can not keep Amazons  from being angry. They are ones offended. They will fight to avenge.  Shampoo is Amazon, and champion.  You not make her lose face!  Must accept.”<p>
  Ranma grimaced. “Fine. But I don’t have to like it.”  He stage whispered back<p>
  Zhu Shu put her hands on her hips. “And think we do  when put self in danger?”<p>
  “Hey, I can handle myself!”<p>
  “So can Amazons.”<p>
  “Son-in-law. It’s noble of you to want to protect her  and Akane, but it’s unneeded.” Ke Lun interjected into the whispered argument. “We  are about to go into a battle where we all need to be focused. If you are  trying to protect them, you will leave yourself vulnerable. That in turn will  make them try to watch out for you and leave them vulnerable. You must swear  you will concentrate on your own fights and <em>only</em> your own fights or I will force you to stay here.”<p>
  “Oh yeah, I’d like to see-“ He stopped dead as Ke Lun  poked him with her stick.<p>
  “Promise, son-in-law.” she said to the frozen figure.<p>
  His eyes looked to Akane and Shan Pu, who were both  studiously ignoring him, then to Zhu Shu, and the pleading in hers. Finally, he  relented, “Very well. I promise on the honor of the Saotome name, I will not  try to defend anyone save myself in battle today.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded and Ke Lun tapped him again. “Thank you  Ranma. Zhu Shu knows it hard, but please, trust her, is needed.” The Mandarin  girl said softly to him. “This Amazon affair. We here because Amazon need help,  and you are betrothed to Champion. Must not make her less in Amazon eyes. Must  not make her seem weaker than man, or you shame her.”<p>
  Ranma sighed. “Okay, okay, fine. But I’m only doing  this because I know they’re <em>almost</em> as  skilled as me.  But if anything happens  to you or Akane… or Shan Pu, I’m not going to promise I won’t come to save you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu met his eyes for a long moment then looked  down.  “Zhu Shu would not ask that. Zhu  Shu would not have asked to allow fiancées to fight own battles at all if not  been important.” she said softly.<p>
  Ranma let his annoyance go. “Hey, it’s okay Zhu Shu.  It’s just, well, I don’t want to see you hurt. I mean, well, you’re my friend,  and Akane’s been really, really nice lately, and I know Shan Pu’s your  blood-sister and all.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave him a small smile. “Zhu Shu sees.” she  said with a satisfied tone. She turned to go back to the others.<p>
  Ranma gave her a puzzled look. “Now what’s that  supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The trip across the small valley was eerily quiet, the  light seeming to get dimmer as they approached the fortress. No birds sang in  the trees and no insects hummed.<p>
  “There is magic here.” Ke Lun murmured. “Evil magic  that hates life. It has drained this place.”<p>
  Akane shivered. “It feels like a cold mist is hovering  here, even though the sun is shining.”<p>
  Ke Lun looked at her appraisingly, and nodded to  herself.<p>
  Zhu Shu just looked sick. “Be glad do not see auras as  deep as Zhu Shu,” was all she said.<p>
  At the lower gates, Ke Lun and Tao-Ching looked at  each other and nodded. They stepped to either side of the gates and shouted in  unison as they poked the stone. A massive explosion erupted as the walls  collapsed. Tao-Ching stepped back from the explosion, his shirt in tatters, and  looked at Ke Lun, standing completely unharmed. “One day I will figure out how  you do that, Warleader,” he grinned.<p>
  The trek up the long winding stair was equally as  unnerving as the valley had been. Shadows far darker than they should have been  in the late morning sun seemed to shift of their own accord.<p>
  “Shan Pu have feeling whoever in castle try to  intimidate.”<p>
  “Fear not fair maiden. The strong arm of Tatewaki Kuno  shall defend thee from any sorcerous threats,” Kuno boasted.<p>
  Ke Lun raised an eyebrow as the younger Amazon started  to turn and brain the kendoist, but was stopped by Zhu Shu.<p>
  “He’s just trying to make himself not feel afraid,” she  said softly in Chinese. “He is not totally crazy.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Under the shadow of the fortress, the sensation of  being loomed over by a dark cloud was stronger than ever. They looked at the  open gates and nodded. Tao-Ching cracked his knuckles and waited until the  group heading for the roof had moved off a little before dousing himself with  water.<p>
  Ke Lun led her group up the walls as the smilodon’s  scream greeted the horde of warriors who poured out of the castle when they  passed the gate. She caught flashes of the huge cat throwing bodies aside; Soun’s  Demon Head attack screaming at a group and sending them flying; the panda  braining black clad warriors with his signs. Then she was too busy dodging  arrows from above.<p>
  Twin whirlwinds shredded the arrows as Shan Pu, Ke Lun  and Ranma cleared the roof line and piled into the troops infesting the  battlements. In moments bodies were flying from the roof as the trio opened up  the way inside. Twin glowing orbs rained down golden destruction as ribbons  tore across the rooftops like lightning. Then an explosion shattered the  doorway into the castle, shrapnel cutting down black clad warriors like chaff.  As the smoke cleared, Ke Lun dusted her hands and led the way inside.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Down in the courtyard, Soun and Genma finally reached  the doors and broke through into an empty hall. Surprised at the sudden lack of  resistance they stalked down the corridor to a large set of double doors. They  smashed them open and stopped.<p>
  Genma held up a sign that read “Have we died and gone  to heaven?”<p>
  Before them lay a large room. Women crowded the room  from wall to wall, setting or laying on cushions. They were all ravishingly  beautiful and dressed only in soft see-through silk robes. Small tables spread  throughout the room held small glasses and large jugs bedewed with  condensation. At first glance, it seemed a welcome invitation to debauchery,  but then they noticed the hopeless stares, the bruises, the collars affixed to  heavy chains. Genma’s sign dropped further and further until finally he ground  it underfoot.<p>
  With out a word, they moved forward. Chains broke in  massive paws as Soun’s more delicate strikes shattered locks. As they moved  deeper into the room, the Amazon warriors who Ke Lun had sent in with them  moved into the room, weapons ready, and saw what the pair was doing. They  nodded grimly as they left the pair to their work and began gathering the girls  to escort outside. The anger that was rising from the two men was growing more  palpable with every girl freed.<p>
  As the last chain was cleared, they looked at the door  that led deeper into the fortress. It was a hugely massive bronze monstrosity  that looked more solid than a mountain. It didn’t even slow them down...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In another part of the fortress, Tao-Ching padded  along another empty corridor. He’d gotten separated from the others during the  fighting and, like usual, had gotten himself lost.<p>
  He stopped outside a door that was slightly ajar as he  heard a booming noise from the other side. He nosed the door open to find  himself in a kitchen. The smell of blood hung heavy in the air from a butchered  deer carcass that hung over a drain on the far side of the large room, next to  a number of wooden casks.<p>
  Warily, he paced into the room, scanning for any  hidden attackers until he stood next to the deer. A wooden cask lay on the  ground next to the drain, its lid carelessly thrown into a corner. Next to the  cask was a set of manacles. Puzzled, He squinted at the poorly written  ideograms on the casks, then growled. He batted the lid of the cask on the  floor over and looked at the word on it...<p>
  With a howl of pure rage, he bounded out of the  kitchen door towards where he had heard the booming noise, looking for any  black clad soldiers on which to unleash his fury. Behind him in the kitchen,  the lid to the water cask spun and rattled before finally settling once more on  its top, mercifully concealing the word “Deer”...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma finally had to admit he was lost. This damn  castle was a maze of twisting corridors, sliding walls and traps. He’d been  separated from the others as they had tried to decide which corridor they were  going to go down and he had just stepped into the mouth of one to see if he  could tell where it went through heavy shadows. But when he had turned back,  the corridor had stretched out behind him as well. He had tried going through  the walls but they were too thick and he hadn’t figured out how Ke Lun did that  trick with the exploding walls yet.<p>
  Eventually, after what seemed hours, he came to a set  of double doors. Faint sounds came from behind it. Cautiously, he opened the  door.<p>
  A large bed occupied the center of the room beyond,  silk curtains hanging down and obscuring the occupants from the door. Ranma  cautiously stepped around the bed until he could see what was occurring within.<p>
  A girl took center place in the bed, obviously  enjoying the attentions of three men simultaneously. Her face was obscured by  the body of the man standing in front of her, but her bobbing motions and the  way she ground her hips back and forth between the other two men were  unmistakable. As he realized the girl had red hair in a long braid, they  convulsed in a massive orgasm. Frozen in shock, Ranma could only stare as  following the display, the girl raised her head and looked at him, her blue  eyes glowing as she licked her lips.<p>
  “Come and join us Ranma.” his doppelganger cooed. “You  know it’s what you want to do, to give in, to forget you were ever anything  else.”<p>
  Ranma tried to back away, tried to step back but  couldn’t. “No! I’m a guy!”<p>
  The double slithered out of the bed. “Really?” Hands  tore away his clothes revealing a female body. “This is who you really are, you  know it is.” Hands fluttered across her skin as her body betrayed her and  responded.<p>
  “Come!” the soft voices of the waiting men whispered,  echoing “Come, come.” Their words drew her forward against her will.<p>
  The door closing behind her cut off her screams…</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Ke Lun knew there was magic afoot when she was  separated from her companions. It had been too quick to have been anything  else. Now she walked down a featureless corridor tapping the walls and floor to  see if they concealed hidden openings.<p>
  A faint scream, quickly cut off drew her attention. It  had seemed to come from ahead. She started moving in that direction.<p>
  At the end of the corridor she found a large set of  double doors. She looked around but there was no signs that anyone else had  passed this way, or of any other corridors. The smell of trap was strong. She  turned to look behind her, knowing already what she was going to see.<p>
  The corridor behind her was gone.<p>
  “So, I’m being herded.” she muttered. She listened  intently for several minutes, her long rabbit ears quivering, but no sound  could be heard. “Well, then, let’s see what you have for me, mine enemy.”<p>
  She glided softly forward, her youthful body making  not a sound as she opened the door enough to slip through.<p>
  Darkness greeted her. She strained to see through the  enveloping gloom, but not a shred of light revealed itself. Her ears twitched  as she tried to pick up a sound.<p>
  Nothing.<p>
  She stepped forward carefully, her stick feeling along  the floor for pitfalls, but as she moved she felt herself stumble as a weakness  struck her. She fell to the floor as she felt herself becoming heavier and all  strength fled from her. Light returned to the room to show her that she had  become a withered, aged thing, her health and beauty flown once more. She  attempted to move, but the weight of years pinned her to the floor. Drool  escaped from her lips as her head began wobbling on her pipe stem neck.<p>
  Then a foot stepped into her sight. She fought to  raise her eyes to look up at the strong silhouette of Shan Pu above her.<p>
  “You are old, Great-grandmother.” The figure said.<p>
  <em>Old old old old old old old old old</em> the wind whispered around the room as she felt her  heart begin to slow. Time seemed to be eating her up.<p>
  A figure appeared behind Shan Pu, a figure shadowy and  dim. She tried to speak, to warn Shan Pu, but her tongue lolled uselessly in  her mouth as she tried to form words.<p>
  Shan Pu leaned closer to pat her hand. “Don’t worry  Great-grandmother, I am the Champion.” She laughed as she turned and embraced  the shadowy figure, offering her lips in a kiss as Death claimed her.<p>
  The door closed softly behind her as Death laughed,  enjoying her despair at the helplessness she felt as age robbed her of her last  joy…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Shan Pu was not happy.<p>
  She had been wandering in this maze for what seemed  hours, cut off from her friends and unable to find anyone to take her  frustrations out on. The maze just wound on and on.<p>
  She had tried bashing through the walls but they  seemed to take no damage from her hardest blows, and she had given up on trying  to keep track of the turns she had taken. Now she simply followed the corridor  hoping that the end of it would bring her someone to hit.<p>
  Finally, she came to a large set of double doors.  Cautiously, she pulled open the door and peeked inside.<p>
  “Oh, do stop pussyfooting around Shan Pu.” Akane said.  “I know it comes naturally to your kitty nature, but it’s annoying.”<p>
  Shan Pu blinked. “How- Where- But-“ she said in shock.  The last thing she’d expected to see in the room was her fiancée, and Akane  seemed angry with her.<p>
  “Oh, come now, surely you saw it coming. Did you  really think I could love you? I beat you twice, Ranma beat you. Some Champion  you are. And to top it off, you’re just an animal.”<p>
  Shan Pu’s eyes filled with moisture. “Why Ai Ren say  such things?”<p>
  “Because they’re true, Shan Pu.” Ranma’s voice said.  He stepped out of the shadows behind Akane. “Really, did you think you could  just waltz into our hearts and make us love you? You’re worthless as an Amazon,  and worthless as a wife. All you are is a failure! You can’t even stay decently  human. Why would you even think I would marry a cat?”<p>
  “But- but-“ Shan Pu tried to back away from the  accusing eyes, only to run into another body. She whirled to see Zhu Shu  glaring at her as well.<p>
  “So you make all the work I did pointless.” The  Mandarin girl said harshly. “Why did I even bother? Why did I let myself be  blood-sister to such a worthless piece of trash like you? Your mother should  have saved everyone the bother and drowned you in a sack. Isn’t that how to  deal with unwanted kittens?”<p>
  “No- no-“ Shan Pu sobbed and turned to see Ke Lun  staring at her coldly.<p>
  “I can’t believe I thought you might be worth  training. I should have killed you when you failed to give Akane the Kiss of  Death. An Amazon does not submit to an Outland woman. You weak worthless  creature!” Cold water splashed across Shan Pu as she turned into a cat. “Go!  Live out your life with the animals! You are not worthy to be an Amazon!” She  turned her back on Shan Pu.<p>
  The closing door cut off the long drawn out yowl of  pure misery…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The corridors stretched on endlessly. For all the rage  they had built up in the harem room, the lack of enemies had allowed it to ebb  and now, they sought only the way out.<p>
  Soun was worried about the women they had left to the  Amazons, had they gotten out? It seemed like he and Genma had wandered through  this maze for hours…<p>
  Had they taken the fortress?<p>
  The biggest problem with Genma being a Panda was his  silence, and they were too eager to find the exit to take the time for him to  write a sign.<p>
  Then, they turned a corner and came to a large set of double  doors.<p>
  “What do you think?” Genma’s sign asked.<p>
  “Maybe it’s the exit.” Soun said softly.<p>
  They pushed the doors open carefully. A golden light  poured out from inside, along with a delicious smell. Mouths watering, they  pushed the door open further.<p>
  A huge banquet lay on a table surrounded by piles of  gold and gems. Their jaws dropped as they took in the massive wealth and  drifted towards the table. Genma took out his battered sign from earlier and  held it up again.<p>
  They started to descend on the table when a querulous  voice stopped them.<p>
  “You leave my treasures alone!”<p>
  A small shriveled man in a white Gi covered in food  stains emerged from one of the piles of gold. His head was covered by a dirty  bandanna and cracked glasses covered his eyes.<p>
  “Your treasures!” A second voice called. From another  pile crawled another shriveled figure, this one in a filthy black Gi. His long  white hair was knotted and unkempt and his mustache almost reached his toes. “Those  are my treasures!” He picked up a jug of something from the table and smashed  it over the first figures head.<p>
  The shriveled, almost white panda began a furious  fight with the second figure as Soun and Genma simply stared in horror while  finding their voices.<p>
  The closing door shut off the horrified scream of “Noooooo-“</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane was not happy. She had been cut off from  everyone and lost in this maze for what seemed hours. Her ribbons lashed behind  her like tails as she stalked the halls. She’d tried lashing out at the walls  but no matter what she had tried, nothing made a dent.<p>
  The place was really freaking her out though. The  whole area felt strange, like currents blew through it constantly though there  wasn’t a breath of wind. It felt like the shadows moved when she wasn’t  looking, or like the walls slowly shifted place around her. Even the auras she  could see seemed... misty.<p>
  An explosion from ahead of her drew her attention and  she ran for the noise. Several more explosions followed by a scream came before  she saw the large double doors. She burst through into a scene straight out of  hell.<p>
  Lightning arced around the room, and Akane froze for a  moment to take stock. What she saw horrified her. The source of the lightning  was a figure she recognized as Makoto, but the surges were completely uncontrolled,  the last gasps of power leaking from her hands as she knelt, coughing up blood  from a vicious stomach wound. A faint noise made it to her ears past the  thunderclaps and she turned.<p>
  Rei wasn’t in any better shape. She was impaled by her  wrists to a steel I- beam. Blood streamed down her face from empty eye sockets,  while her two crows sat on her shoulders relishing the treats. It was obvious  from the amount of blood streaming from her wrists that the arteries had been  severed, and the fact she was still barely alive as the crows picked at her  made Akane nauseous.<p>
  Something hit her in the back and she whirled. The  round object had two long tassels of blond hair. Akane didn’t even try to turn  it over, fearing what she’d see. Another scream drew her attention to Minako,  busy dying while suspended from dozens of gold heart linked chains.<p>
  Then, she saw Ami running towards her. “Akane! Run!”<p>
  A shadow moved behind the terrified girl as Akane  found herself unable to move. She couldn’t even scream as the shadow caught up  to Ami. Bloody blades appeared from her chest as she was lifted off her feet.  Blood fountained from her mouth as she reached towards Akane, then she  convulsed as the blades were ripped from her. She landed in a heap at the  shadows’ feet.<p>
  Akane stared in horror at the blades in the shadow’s  hands, the ebony dragons seeming to drink in the light, then she saw the black  fuku the figure wore and her eyes reluctantly rose to see the figures face.<p>
  Jade green eyes met hers coldly from under a jet black  dragon. A vicious smile graced the blood red lips. “Well, hello Akane. Have you  come to ‘save me’ too? It’s much, much too late for that.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu.” She whispered in disbelief.<p>
  “No, not anymore. Chaos has become my lover and Death  my follower. I was reborn in the darkness. I am the Black Dragon.”<p>
  “Oh, no... no... no...” Akane’s swords dropped from  nerveless fingers as the other girl stepped up to her. One sword came to rest  on her collar bone as tears ran down her face.<p>
  “So, you are powerless to fight me, though you know  you alone may stop me.” Zhu Shu’s laugh was tinged with madness. “So instead, I  shall make you my play toy…”<p>
  Akane’s sobs were silenced as the door closed behind  her…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu mistrusted the mists around her. She sensed  too many currents through the fog, too many shifting auras. It was definitely a  spell of some kind.<p>
  Time had been distorted in this place, and ever since  they had entered from above. She had heard strange noises and echoing sounds  that were so faint as to be barely audible. Flashes of light had also come  briefly through the fog.<p>
  Closing her eyes, she felt along the traceries of  energy around her, invisible walls bright in her mind. She sensed Akane and  Shan Pu faintly, but the walls around her prevented any real sense of  direction.<p>
  Enough was enough. She drew her swords and began a  dance. Reaching out with her mind, she grabbed a hold of the energies around  her and swirled them into a vortex with a cry of “Ashura’s Call!”<p>
  As more and more of the energy was drawn into her  vortex, the fog around her began to roil and tendrils tried to reach for her.  They were swept up into her dance as well. As her energy levels continued to  rise she began the steps of one of her family’s strongest techniques. According  to her grandfather, the Amazons had long ago been taught part of the technique,  but only her family knew how to do both halves of the Ascending Dragon.<p>
  She separated her chi as she danced, filtering out the  angry hot chi of her frustration and the energies around her from the cool  calmness of her normal self. A spiral began to form on the floor around her,  half hot melted rock, half frozen stone. As she reached the center of her  spiral, she released her hold on both sides and channeled them upwards with a  shout of “Hiryuu Shoten Ha!”<p>
  For a second the fog fought, but it was unable to  resist the howling call of the vortex and with a loud roar, it was sucked into  the whirlwind that erupted through the roof of the large room that was  revealed. Zhu Shu settled softly back to the ground, stumbling slightly as the  last of the fog was stripped from the room. Despite the best restoratives the  Amazons had given her, her chi was still far too low after yesterday’s run.<p>
  She found herself in the middle of a maze painted in  blood. Stairs led upwards to the shattered roof, ending where Zhu Shu’s tornado  had ripped it apart. Another set of stairs led downwards deeper into the  castle. As she scanned the room, her eyes fell on a massive pile of fur lying  on a pile of what smelled to be catnip. She frowned. Someone had anticipated  dealing with a smilodon, and that meant this was definitely a trap.<p>
  Large double doors stood across the room from the  stairs. The maze on the floor seemed to exit directly to it. Cautiously, she  stepped across to it, taking care not to step on any of the blood lines. The  door was ajar, but beyond it, only darkness could be seen. She stepped through  and tried to let her eyes adjust. The sense of Shan Pu and Akane’s presence was  immediately obvious, but she still could not see anything beyond the single  bright bar of light from the door behind her.<p>
  “Zhu Shu?” Akane’s voice came faintly from somewhere  in the darkness in front of her. “Zhu Shu, help! I can’t move! I’ve caught my  foot in something.”<p>
  “Akane?” She stepped forward warily, peering into the  darkness. Was that her moving at the very edge of the light?<p>
  Then bright flares of fire surrounded her as the door  slammed shut. A hexagram burned in the darkness around her. She tried to jump  out of it, but she ran into a barrier, her swords sparking furiously as they  skittered along a wall of force. Mad laughter rang out around her as the  darkness was ripped away, revealing a throne room. Her friends were chained to  the walls on either side, blank unseeing eyes staring forward. A tall shadowy  figure sat in the throne, his form obscured by the haze of darkness that  crawled around him.<p>
  “Welcome to my mousetrap, Little Mouse.” He said, his  voice chilling her as it seemed to crawl up and down her spine.<p>
  Zhu Shu tried to draw the energy in for a second time,  but to her horror, she felt her chi draining away, eaten away second by second  by the hexagram.<p>
  “I anticipated that, Child of the Dragon. The spells  around you feed on you. The harder you attempt to escape, the more they will  drain. Do not try too hard. My Master wishes you alive, and you would not enjoy  the side effects of a resurrection spell.”<p>
  Zhu Shu hacked at the barrier, but once again, her  swords simply skittered along the unseen wall, drawing sparks. In despair she  looked at her friends, feeling helpless as the spell drained away her strength.  Her knees gave way as she slowly settled to the floor, hands pressed against  the invisible wall.<p>
  “Fiend! Villain! Defiler of defenseless women!” A  voice came behind her. She turned to see Kuno standing in the doorway. “Prepare  to face the Wrath of Blue Thunder!”<p>
  Blue light crawled along the naked blade in Kuno’s  hands…<p>
  “So the fool has finally made his entrance.” the  shadowy figure said. “I had expected you much sooner.” He made a motion with  his left hand as shadows leapt for Kuno.<p>
  The glowing blade slid around and sliced the shadows  into shreds. Wails and shrieks could be heard faintly as the shadows faded.<p>
  “Your sorcery is useless against one who bears the Demon’s  Fang, villain. With this ancient blade my ancestor slew the Shadowslayer, a  mighty ninja who sought his Daimyo’s life. Long have I awaited a quest worthy  of it, and today, it shall drink your blood.”<p>
  The shadowy figure had sat on the throne looking  curiously at Kuno as he postured. “You don’t really talk that way normally, do  you?”<p>
  “Fiend! Draw your blade lest I slay you out of hand!”<p>
  The shadowy figure stood with a chuckle. “This should  be entertaining.” He drew a long Tai Chi sword, its blade black as midnight. “You stand no chance against  one who may not be slain by mortal weapons.” He assumed a stance.<p>
  Kuno’s eyes narrowed as he took in his opponent.  Nabiki had warned him the fiend feared his blade, so he knew the wizard was  bluffing. With a loud cry, he attacked.<p>
  Blades met with a crash of thunder, blue light  clashing with the shadowy haze around the other sword, and both opponents  strove to bear the other back. With a grunt, Kuno forced the shadow back.<p>
  Lightning fast thrusts met and blocked each other as  they danced around one another in a lethal contest, neither lowering their  guard even a fraction. Zhu Shu looked on amazed. Kuno may have been limited in  his ability to deal with other arts, but when it came to the blade, he was  every bit as skilled as he claimed. Had he ever fought her seriously, one sword  to one sword, he might have been her match…<p>
  Yet as she watched, she realized Kuno wasn’t done with  surprises yet. He had a purposefulness she had never seen before and every  stroke seemed precise, without the carelessness he exhibited so often with the bokken.<p>
  She watched as he drew his opponent into a momentary  bind that resulted in them both backing up a few steps and he unleashed a call  of “I strike!”<p>
  His sword flashed into a blur of thrusts as his  opponent tried to dodge, but air pressure ripped into him, driving him back. He  did a flip to escape Kuno’s range and landed, the tatters of shadows ripped  from him flowing back to rejoin. The shadow being laughed. “I told you, no  mortal weapon may slay me!” He threw back his head and laughed.<p>
  Kuno smiled.  “I  bear no mortal weapon, demon,” he said as his sword pulsed with power.  “I am a <em>Kuno</em>.  The sword of my fathers has ever been an  instrument of the gods, forged from the fang of a Lord of the Youkai for the  defense of humanity from the likes of you!”<p>
  The shadow’s eyes glowed as he resumed a stance.  “Then kill me if you can, mortal.  I have slain far greater devil hunters than  you.”<p>
  “You shall kill no more.  I will defend my goddess to my last breath.”  Tatewaki said quietly.<p>
  The blade pulsed again, almost shaking the room with  it’s noiseless throb.<p>
  The room darkened once more as the Shadow seemed to  suck in all the light, his sword growing even darker as blood red runes began  to glow with a dusky light.<p>
  “Then come, Devil Hunter.  My sword will enjoy the taste of your soul!”<p>
  The shadow lunged, the last vestiges of light  vanishing as the room plunged into darkness…<p>
  Then there was a flare of light as she heard the sound  of shattering steel.<p>
  Kuno stood, his back to the demon, the katana in his  hand no longer a slim blade, but a massive falchion, held easily in one hand as  he slowly straightened from the finished form.   The same blood red runes as the shadow’s sword burned along its black  surface for a moment before they faded and the sword began returning to  silver.  Kuno ignored it as he turned to  the shadow figure, still frozen in a lunge, it’s shattered sword extended.<p>
  And then, with all the slowness of a toppling tree the  shadow’s head tilted forward, farther and father, until it began to fall.  Then, with a soundless explosion it vanished.<p>
  The Hexagram on the floor around Zhu Shu flared into  brilliance than faded and was gone. Around her, one by one, the others woke  from their blank eyed stares, their shackles vanishing in puffs of dark smoke.<p>
  A hand reached down to offer Zhu Shu a help up. She  took Kuno’s hand in wonder, noting that he had sheathed what was once again a  katana.<p>
  “Art thou well?” he asked gently.<p>
  “Yes, Zhu Shu thanks for freeing her.”<p>
  Kuno blushed. “There is no need for thanks, fair  goddess. It is the duty of any true samurai.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded, staring at Kuno in wonder. Why was he  so different than normal?<p>
  “Kuno? Are you feeling ok?” Akane asked seeing the  strange exchange.<p>
  Kuno turned and bowed. “Indeed, my beauteous Akane. I  have never felt better. I have slain the evil sorcerer to save my Chinese  Goddess and free you from the evil spell he cast on both you and my sister. Now  pray, let me give to you the Kiss of True Love which will break forever it’s  evil hold on you and free you from this desire for thine own sex which it hath  cursed thee with!”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. She should have known. She winced as a  foot and a bon buri connected with Kuno’s head from either side.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>They managed to drag the Saber-tooth tiger off the  pile of catnip and get him groggily awake before dousing him with hot water,  then the Amazons found them, having been blocked from entry to the outer room  until the death of the shadow. Along the way, they had found the treasury, and  with the aid of the girls Soun and Genma had freed, they had emptied it.<p>
  Daylight was fading a half hour later as they crested  the pass, burdened with the wealth of the Musk. Tao-Ching kept looking at the  sky as they crept along the mountain path.<p>
  “What are you looking for, cousin?” Shan Pu asked.<p>
  The roar of several jets passing overhead drowned out  his reply. As they dove past the crest, several white plumes erupted from their  undersides and streaked down towards the Musk fortress. Several loud explosions  ripped through the dusk as a fireball rose above the pass.  The ground shuddered violently as a loud  groaning noise followed the initial explosion.   A massive cracking noise sundered the air as they watched the stone  plateau separate from the mountainside.   For a long frozen moment, the castle tilted crazily over the ravine,  then with a rumble of shattered rock, it fell into the gulf.  A massive plume of dust obscured the area  where it fell, but the rumbles of its destruction shook the pass, dislodging  boulders and dust.  Then the massive  noise faded into an overwhelming silence.<p>
  Tao-Ching grinned at the stunned group. “That cost a  fortune, but it was worth it.”<p>
  Ke Lun laughed as she turned and led the way down the  mountain…</p>
