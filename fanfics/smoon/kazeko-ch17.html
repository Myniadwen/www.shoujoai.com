<h1>Kazeko (part 17 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Ailan stared at the crystal in her hands, lavender eyes entranced by the 
tiny silver stone.  It whispered to her, singing a sad song of loss and 
loneliness as she felt more and more of her hum in response.  She didn&#39;t 
recognize the stone from having ever seen it in the Silver Millennium, 
but some part of her &#150;blood, body, soul&#151;beat in tune with it.  In a very 
old, very ancient way, Ailan knew that she belonged to the stone, that 
she served the stone, and she was ready to help its quest.  But she had 
no idea why.
 
&quot;Ailan?&quot;
 
She looked up as Setsuna entered the bedroom they shared.  The Senshi of 
Time recoiled from the new light in her lover&#39;s eyes, knowing that the 
struggle to find a new balance with the stone would soon end and that 
their daughter had endured the same strain.  But the ginzuishou was not 
half so old or a tenth as powerful as the gekkouzuishou could be, and 
that frightened Setsuna in a way she could not put into words.  Ailan 
seemed unaware of her change.  &quot;Setsuna?&quot;
 
&quot;I wanted to see how you&#39;re coping.  The stone is very powerful and you 
haven&#39;t channeled vast amounts of planetary mana in a very long time.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s older than the Silver Millennium,&quot; Ailan whispered, &quot;older than 
all of the ages of peace and great wars and times of darkness.  She&#39;s 
older than any peace treaty and alliance, any light or hope, but younger 
than the darkness she fights.  She&#39;s lonely Setsu-chan; she lost her 
daughter long ago and keeps trying to get her back, but they never meet.  
It has not been their destiny to do so yet.  When she meets her child, 
the world will change and all Balance will be irrevocably cast in a new 
direction.  She&#39;ll change the world, but even she cannot say for good or 
ill.&quot;
 
&quot;Daughter?  The ginzuishou, maybe?&quot;
 
Ailan wrinkled her nose.  &quot;The ginzuishou is her shadow, her follower, 
merely another defender of the light.  Her daughter helped write the new 
order, the one she defends and recreates every time she is called, and 
she is powerful, too.  But they have not crossed paths since the Sailor 
Wars, I think.&quot;
 
Ailan&#39;s eyes grew distant, and Setsuna stepped back as more power pulsed 
from the crystal.  She still wasn&#39;t entirely certain the tiny stone she 
had begged her father for was safe.  Ailan seemed to notice the action, 
and she frowned, glancing at the power weaving its way into her soul.  
&quot;This, Setsu-chan?  She worries you?&quot;
 
&quot;She was supposed to go back, Ailan.  Hades was afraid of her, keeping 
her locked away in his palace far away.  Anything that makes a god 
nervous scares the hell out of me.  I&#39;m just worried that you&#39;re 
becoming one with her too fast, that she&#39;ll subsume your personality 
until there is no more Hikarino Ailan.  I don&#39;t want that to happen.&quot;
 
Ailan looked at her crystal again, urging it to return to the star 
locket.  &quot;I don&#39;t know why she won&#39;t go back.  She feels that it is her 
time, I think.  I don&#39;t know why she chose me, though.  If she had to 
choose someone, why not Usagi?&quot;
 
&quot;She couldn&#39;t have chosen Usagi.  First of all, Usagi has the 
ginzuishou, and while it may be less dangerous, less powerful, and 
younger, it is not less sentient and demanding.  It is linked to her 
soul, perhaps more intimately that it ever touched yours, since Usagi 
was born with the stone inside her.  Second, she is not only the 
daughter of two senshi, but the granddaughter of a god, the God of the 
Underworld.  I&#39;ve spoken to some of my family and consulted some of the 
oldest texts tonight while you were recovering, and they and what 
legends I&#39;ve heard of this &#145;First Stone&#39; indicate that she deals in the 
eradication of all evil, all darkness, and all pain.  Death is pain.  
She would not choose the granddaughter of death.  Thirdly, she is a very 
demanding stone.  Persephone tells me that her other hosts in the very 
distant past were pure, untainted by power.  Usagi has had her dark 
moments, and her moments of evil, and she&#39;s died.  Taints like that 
drive the stone away.  It takes a woman pure of heart, mind, body, and 
soul, free of any and all other power, to accept the crystal.  You&#39;re 
human; there is no greater innocent purity.&quot;
 
A slow smile spread across Ailan&#39;s face, and Setsuna recognized her 
lover taking control.  &quot;You mean that I&#39;m only a Senshi because I never 
was a senshi?  I&#39;m one of you because I was born human?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, but she&#39;ll only take a child of the Moon.  The part of you that 
still is Lunarian, your soul, is what made the ginzuishou refuse to heal 
you.  It won&#39;t heal one it once controlled once it has a new host.  That 
same part identified you as a daughter of the Moon and a candidate for 
the Silver Moonlight Crystal, and it latched onto that.  It must have a 
mission here.  With Usagi taken, it needed you as the only other 
Lunarian who could help it.  That must be why Balance ordered that you 
not be reborn.&quot;
 
Ailan closed the broach and placed it on the table beside her, wincing 
as she lost contact.  She sensed Setsuna relax, and she smiled as she 
patted the bed.  &quot;If it&#39;s really that powerful, I&#39;ll take it slow and 
make sure not to let it control me.  Come to bed, Setsu-chan.&quot;  Setsuna 
slipped into bed beside Ailan, stroking the smaller woman&#39;s silver hair 
as they both settled down to sleep, exhausted.  &quot;Setsuna?&quot;
 
&quot;Hmm?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can do this.  Be a senshi, I mean.  I&#39;ve never done 
it before.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Setsuna purred as they both fell asleep.  &quot;I&#39;ll watch out 
for you.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Neptune chased the solid wraith across the beach, her element calling to 
her, begging her to be careful, offering to help her.  For the moment, 
she was alone, but her fellow senshi would arrive soon.  A brief second 
of thought led her to conclude that she had not been alone since Ami 
told her that she was pregnant, especially not fighting the servants of 
the Dark One, as they had come to call the queen of their enemies.  They 
had only glimpsed her once, before Ailan became a senshi, and the last 
Queen of the Silver Millennium had yet to prove herself in battle.  
Perhaps she would answer this call, Neptune mused.  Haruka, the 
ever-protective &#145;father&#39;, had been at the track all day, so Michiru had 
been walking home alone from her brief violin recital with three of her 
colleagues.  When she spotted the wraith hovering near the water&#39;s edge 
within striking distance of a few families, she called the other senshi 
and took off after it.
 
She was tiring quickly, her body sore in places she hadn&#39;t dreamed of 
months earlier, the added weight and bulk slowing her down and shifting 
her center of balance enough to prevent her usual agile leaps.  Haruka 
didn&#39;t want her running or fighting, but Michiru refused to let her 
pregnancy endanger Tokyo or her princess.
 
The wraith turned and entered a sea-side cave, Neptune close behind.  
She stopped just inside, the cool waters of her element caressing her 
bare and swollen ankles, her wife&#39;s wind calling her name, begging her 
to be cautious, urging her to wait.  The others would arrive in just a 
little bit; she could wait until then.  Neptune brushed the words away.  
She was tired of being cautious and tired of waiting for the others.  
She could fight alone.
 
Neptune entered the cave, raising her mirror to reveal the dark 
recesses.  Light surrounded her, and little gems sparkled in the dim 
glow.  She heard a sound deeper in the dark cave, and she swallowed once 
before moving forward.  When the last of the light behind her vanished, 
Neptune stepped onto a shelf of rock looking down on a shallow crater in 
a huge cavern where her mirror was no longer required.  A tall, dark 
woman sat on a throne in the center, her long black dress flowing to the 
ground in silky layers, her wraith minions swarming around her.  She was 
the source of the light and, oddly enough, the darkness, her red eyes 
seeing everything.  All activity stopped as the senshi entered the 
cavern, and the queen stood, her feet finding a walkway from her dais to 
Neptune&#39;s ledge, her skirts fluttering around her feet as she walked.  
&quot;Sailor Neptune,&quot; she greeted, her voice a growl and a gentle whisper, 
barely a breath but loud enough for all of her minions to hear and 
understand.  &quot;I was wondering when you senshi would finally arrive.&quot;  
The woman stopped in front of the senshi, a mocking smile on her face as 
she peeked behind the frozen woman.  &quot;Where are your friends?&quot;
 
Neptune took a step back, automatically placing a protective hand on her 
slightly-swollen belly, the five-month bulge more easily apparent in her 
Sailor fuku.  The Dark Queen&#39;s blood red eyes widened, flying to the 
aqua-haired senshi&#39;s belly.  &quot;No,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Not again!  She was 
supposed to stop this!  I will not tolerate such a blatant disregard for 
the balance of fate!&quot;  She returned to her throne in an instant, waving 
her arm at the woman.  &quot;Dispose of her and rip that child from her 
belly.&quot;
 
&quot;No,&quot; Neptune whispered, backing up.  For the first time in her life, 
the senshi of the eighth planet was going to run away, but she had to 
for the sake of Haruka&#39;s baby.  A sound behind her, a whispery hiss, 
informed the senshi that she was surrounded and there could be no 
running away.  Raising her hands, both glowing with the blue of her 
power, Neptune prepared to fight for her life and her daughter.  She 
would not go down so easily.
 
&quot;Moonlight Flash!!&quot;
 
Light filled the cavern, eradicating the nearest dark minions.  The 
queen hissed her displeasure at the sudden interruption, eyes widening 
as a silver-suited senshi entered the cave, clothed in a silver power 
that lit the cave and drove away the darkness.  &quot;Ai to seigi no, Seeraa 
fuku Bishoujo Senshi, Sailor Moonlight!  Tsukini kawatte, oshiokiyo!&quot;
 
Neptune almost laughed as she heard Usagi&#39;s traditional greeting from 
her mother, but the silver-haired woman did not speak for the same 
reason the blonde princess did.  Usagi&#39;s voice was her strongest weapon, 
and the distraction her speeches provided often provided the senshi with 
an opening to defeat the youma of the week.  Ailan used the words as a 
last resort, desperate to buy Neptune a few seconds, still uncertain of 
her own powers.  The Dark Queen was not amused.  She stared at 
Moonlight, her glowing eyes even more furious than before.  &quot;That stone 
was hidden in the depths of death itself!  It was not to be used ever 
again.&quot;
 
As the shadowy wraiths backed away from the light Ailan emitted, the 
newest senshi crossed her arms over her chest, Pluto and Uranus 
appearing behind her.  &quot;We don&#39;t care anymore about your plan.  You 
never wanted Helios to be born and you wanted Earth to fall into 
darkness.  So I don&#39;t care what you think about me or my stone and I 
will personally insure the safe birth of this child.  Regardless of what 
you think.&quot;
 
Uranus scooped Neptune into her arms, letting Pluto defend them as she 
leapt away, heading out of the seaside cave.  Ailan waved her hand, and 
a long, pearlescent white staff appeared in her hand, a silver crescent 
moon on top, a tiny clear crystal in the curve of the moon, silver flaws 
sparkling from the inside of the stone.  The dark queen moved to fight 
Pluto, but Moonlight raised her new staff, defying her.  &quot;You cannot 
stop me.  It is time for Chaos to cover this galaxy once more.  The time 
of the senshi is over!  All of you will die with that child, especially 
you, abomination.&quot;
 
&quot;None of that, now,&quot; Moonlight warned, a cold feeling in the pit of her 
stomach at the mention of the baby.  &quot;Go, Pluto.&quot;
 
An instant later, the dark queen was alone.  She clenched her fists, 
vowing that Moonlight and the child of Uranus and Neptune must die.  She 
sensed that another daughter had been born of two senshi, long before 
even Helios, but the twists of power and time kept the child&#39;s identity 
from her.  She knew, though, that only a few senshi in the Silver 
Millennium were strong enough to birth a daughter, and one was her own 
servant.  One of the others was the queen of the moon.  &quot;Wraiths!  Have 
you located any of the Cupids yet?&quot;
 
&quot;No, mistress,&quot; the leader hissed.  &quot;They have been remarkably silent of 
late.  I think they know you are looking for the cupid assigned to your 
servant.&quot;
 
&quot;Which means we won&#39;t find him.  Very well, Plan B.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Uranus placed Neptune on the ground underneath the old tree, green eyes 
scanning her wife for injuries.  &quot;Are you okay?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Neptune whispered unconvincingly, hands shaking.  &quot;They 
wanted to kill our baby, Haruka.  She really wants her dead.  Haruka, 
I&#39;m so scared.  For the first time in my life, for the first time since 
I became a senshi, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;
 
Uranus embraced her aqua-haired partner.  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Michi.  I 
should have been with you.  From now on, for the rest of your pregnancy 
and as long after that as needed, I will never leave your side.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka!  What about your races?  You have a life of your own, parts of 
your day that don&#39;t include me, and you can&#39;t give that up.&quot;
 
&quot;If you can&#39;t make it to my races, then I won&#39;t go.  It&#39;s not like a few 
months off will hurt my career at all&#151;it&#39;ll probably make me more 
popular.  I will protect you.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka, you can&#39;t give up racing for me.  It&#39;s your dream.&quot;
 
&quot;No, Michiru.&quot;  Haruka placed her hand on Michiru&#39;s swollen belly, a 
smile on her face.  &quot;This is my dream.  You two are my future, the only 
future I want or need, and I will make sure that this dream, this 
future, at last comes true.  Nothing else matters.&quot;
 
Neptune wiped the tears from her eyes, pulling herself into Uranus&#39;s 
arms.  &quot;I love you so much, Ruka.&quot;
 
&quot;I love you, too, Michi.&quot;
 
A few feet away from the old tree, Pluto touched the smooth white staff 
in Moonlight&#39;s hand.  &quot;So, where did that come from?&quot;
 
&quot;I haven&#39;t the slightest.  When I faced the Dark Queen, some old 
instinct buried in the Moonlight Crystal called this staff forth.  Like 
Sailor Moon, I use a tool to channel my power.  I didn&#39;t need it for the 
Moonlight Flash, but it might have helped.  And I also have no idea 
where my power even came from.  But when I heard the Dark Queen threaten 
Michiru-san&#39;s child, I felt light and knowledge fill me.  I knew how to 
eradicate the darkness, and I did.&quot; 

&quot;Ailan, I don&#39;t know much about that crystal, but I do know that its 
primary power is the creation and maintenance of order above all other 
callings.  She&#39;s powerful and her only duty is to fight chaos.  But 
Balance requires that Chaos rule every now and then, and now that she 
knows that Eurynome has chosen a carrier for her crystal, Balance will 
be after you.&quot;  Pluto shook her head, trying to hide the tears in her 
eyes.  &quot;I wish you had never gotten into this.&quot;
 
Moonlight pulled Pluto into her arms and rested her head on the taller 
woman&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;I never gave you a choice, Setsu-chan.  I want to 
protect you.  You had no idea that the crystal would react to me as it 
did, and you certainly had no idea that Eurynome would choose me to be 
her next avatar.  Besides, I wish your weren&#39;t involved in this whole 
senshi business either.&quot;
 
&quot;I have an excuse,&quot; Pluto whispered, a smile lighting her face.  &quot;I&#39;m 
Hades&#39;s daughter.  I was born to be the senshi of Pluto.&quot;
 
&quot;I was the queen of the Moon.  I was also born to be a senshi.&quot;  
Moonlight smiled as her staff disappeared, wrapping both arms around her 
lover and former husband.  &quot;Look, I have faith that we will get through 
this.  As long as Balance is focused on me, she won&#39;t notice Usagi.  I 
think our old shields and blocks are enough to keep our daughter safe.  
I am not afraid of her.&quot;
 
&quot;That comes from the stone, love.  Don&#39;t let it overpower you.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry; I know what I&#39;m doing.&quot;</pre>
