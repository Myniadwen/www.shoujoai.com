<p><u>“<em>Mouth: alpha – vii.”</em></u></p>
<p>Usagi slid her hands from  the steering wheel after parking her vehicle along the curb; gently the  long-haired woman let her body thump against the cushion of her seat.  Her bangs draped casually over her eyes so with an exasperated exhale,  her molasses hues were sent chaotically about her countenance. Her mind  ran through the imaginary checklist that held her mental notes. The  baby had been dropped off with her mother and her replacement for work  had been situated. The day had <em>just</em> begun but she already felt  the wear seep into her demure body. But it was soon chased from her as  she caught her second wind. Righting herself, a mischievous grin  coursed her lips. Usagi pulled her hair into her trademarked hairstyle,  which she insisted was a part of her legend – the eternal double buns –  it made it difficult for anyone to resist grabbing them to see if  they’re really…real.</p>
<p>Tearing from the pit of her car, the young  mother bounded straight for the double sliding doors of her childhood  hang out. It was here that Usagi still could retain an air of  immaturity and no one would think her less because of it. Clopping in  on heeled shoes and a three-piece skirt-suit painted an odd picture.  Thankfully…the counter served to put a halt to her almost out of  control motoring. Delicate hands braced the chrome surface before one  dipped into the pit of her purse to retrieve <em>The Crown</em> Passport. A sort of identification for teens who visit this all encompassing hang out.</p>
<p>Behind the counter, a wiry, short-haired man looked towards Usagi questioningly. Motoki had been a servant for <em>The Crown</em> since its opening and a friend to the tribe of <em>special women</em> that frequented the establishment. None of the women though, were as  special as his fiancée, Makoto. The soft eyed, tall brunette – the one  that stole his heart with a simple gift of a puke green muffler; she  had knitted the article when she was only fourteen.</p>
<p>“May I?”</p>
<p>“Usagi-chan…”</p>
<p>“Yes?” delighted the bright-eyed woman.</p>
<p>“You <em>do</em> know that’s not needed – you <em>can</em> come and go as you please,” quipped Motoki, now the proud owner of <em>The Crown.</em></p>
<p>A sheepish smile was brandished, “…Force of habit.”</p>
<p>Motoki nodded a bit, before leaning forth and murmuring, “Besides…the passport is outdated.”</p>
<p>“Uso! I’ll have to renew,” decided Usagi. “Is Mako-chan…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s been waiting since nine,” he paused, “What are you two planning?”</p>
<p>Usagi beamed her patented smile and waved Motoki’s query off. “Give my love to Kakemichi-kun!”</p>
<p>At  that, the effervescent woman trundled into the depths of the neon  lighted establishment. Motoki trawled his gaze towards a decently sized  fish tank. Housed within was his lifelong pet – a lazy eyed turtle.  There his turtle frolicked in his domain, wading in bliss at the bottom  of the tank, partially filled with water.</p>
<p>“What do you think they’re up to, Kakemichi…”</p>
<p>The turtle bubbled his reply.</p>
<p>“Soo. I refuse to clean up their mess then.”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The  door to the private room where they had always met at swung open.  Nestled within was a time-capsule. The décor had changed with the  turning of the years, but the main components remained. Pictures of the  women – younger – were plastered upon opulently colored pressboards,  hugging the walls. Their <em>lives</em> had also been captured, marking  the progress of each of the women. Still present as well, were the  plastic throw-back 1960s-esque chairs. Blue, Orange, Green, Pink and  Red represented the banner colors for each of the now older senshi. The  seats were huddled about a circular table. Ami had once remarked that  it likened them to Arthur’s Knights. Perhaps they were parallel to the  medieval legend…</p>
<p>But that was long ago. No more fighting. No more Youmas.</p>
<p>Though  there was something more pressing to deal with, tougher than any foes  they’d ever had faced. And it was among two of their own.</p>
<p>Makoto  eyed the pieces from their distant past before pressing the earpiece of  her cellular at her ear. At the sound of the door thudding closed, the  tall brunette coursed her gaze towards the entryway. She offered a  salutary wave towards Usagi. Even before Usagi had thrown her question  out, Makoto replied with a mouthed, “Ami-chan.”</p>
<p>Nodding in  understanding, Usagi beelined herself towards the coffee pot nestled at  the crook of the room; all ready helping herself to a healthy cup of  java. The taller woman furrowed her brows at that and sauntered her way  over to the mother of one. Genially she snatched the cup from Usagi’s  hands. Much to Usagi’s behest.</p>
<p>“NO. It’s not as if you <em>need </em>that  stuff Usagi…” Makoto paused, balancing the cup in one hand and evading  Usagi. “Ah…hold on a bit,” she replied towards the other woman still on  the phone. But as she pivoted about, she was met with soft glistening  eyes. Relenting, Makoto shoved the mug back into Usagi’s hands. The  unassuming beauty settled herself upon the forest green plastic seat.  In a few manipulatory motions of her fingers, the brunette had married  her cellular to an ingenious little Japanese device that served as a  sort of speakerphone.</p>
<p>“You’re on, Ami-chan.”</p>
<p>There was a splash of white noise soon accompanied with a few whirs and clicks.</p>
<p>“<em>I can’t believe you two.” </em>It was the first time her voice sounded accusatory.</p>
<p>Usagi and Makoto looked to one another after the initial cringe, “We’re not doing <em>anything</em>.”</p>
<p>“<em>Yet.” </em>A pause, <em>“Is she still there?”</em></p>
<p>Makoto  had nodded before she realized Ami wasn’t there with them, but instead  on call for work. “Hai – since Minako and Terry were at the temple.  Three would have been a crowd.”</p>
<p>“Ami-chan? Aren’t you the <em>least </em>bit curious…,” asked Usagi.</p>
<p>There  was a soft methodical clicking in the background. The women knew that  Ami was deep in thought; she always toyed with her ballpoint pen,  depressing the pen tip out and in again.</p>
<p>“…<em>It’s not my business – It’s always been between them, we all knew this – even before they did. Besides,” </em>paused the doctor, <em>“Aren’t you two supposed to be at work?”</em></p>
<p>“Rei needs a ride to the grounds <em>anyway. </em>We’ll make it into our jobs…later..it’ll be…on the…way.”</p>
<p>“<em>Makoto-chan…”, </em>enunciated the soft spoken doctor, “<em>You’re not good with lying. You’re going to spy on them too, aren’t you? I expected that from Usagi...”</em></p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>“ <em>The main thing is…This isn’t our affair…”</em></p>
<p>“We have to <em>make</em> it our affair then – I don’t know about you both, but I personally  don’t like the tension…”, confessed Usagi. “All they’ve been doing  is…being harsh to one another. They’re two grown women on the outside,  but…still the same fourteen year old kids – it’s…frustrating!”</p>
<p>There was a stunned silence. The eternally bunned woman glanced about, “What?”</p>
<p>“Pot. Kettle. Black,” mused Makoto</p>
<p>And  a laugh erupted from the speakerphone. Usagi though, was confused. As  the laughter died, Ami piped up once more, sighing out,</p>
<p>“<em>You two do what you want, EXCEPT tamper with their relationships…There are more than JUST them involved.”</em></p>
<p>“Terry.”</p>
<p>“<em>Hai.”</em></p>
<p>“Terry-chan’s a nice man,” this garnered an arced brow from the brunette, “…He’s just…<em>not</em> who I imagined Minako-chan with.”</p>
<p>“<em>But she IS. Terry-chan was her personal choice. And from what I see…they’ll be together for a long while…”</em></p>
<p>“This is one time, Ami-chan,” began Makoto, her words tentatively hanging.</p>
<p>“…We hope you’re <em>wrong,</em>” finished Usagi.</p>
<p>The  conversation ended abruptly as the doctor was summoned via pager. She  clicked off the conference call with her long time friends and began to  work a knot loose that settled at the nape of her neck. Tucked into her  leather office chair, Ami whirled to face her windows; she glanced out  her panoramic view over Tokyo…a single thought traveled through her  mind.</p>
<p>Like her friends…she held the same hopes and wishes. Though in hindsight that’s all they were…<em>Disney Wishes.</em></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>At  center stage the only objects and people that needed to be there was a  crimson grand piano, the maestro to the piano and the singer. But  scurrying to and fro was a conga line made up of stagehands. They had  been dressing the colossal stage for the upcoming concert set to occur  in a few days time. Everyone in the entourage knew how particular  Minako could be but she never demanded. She was the type of woman  people would gladly do anything for just to be rewarded with that flash  of a smile.</p>
<p>The American crew didn’t have a chance to bathe in  that glory. Minako was graced on stage, her luxurious raven-mane  spilled over the top of the grand piano while the side of her face  pressed against its fiberglass and her fingers had been splayed. They  curled slowly beginning to drum to a nameless beat. She barely spoke  and acknowledged anyone around her. Minako had notably been…<em>distracted.</em></p>
<p>Then  a gentle tune of a lullaby echoed in the depths of the piano – someone  began tickling the pristine ivory keys; she didn’t have to lift her  eyes to confirm who it was. A smile creased over her lips content with  listening to the <em>heartbeat</em> of the instrument.</p>
<p>“You know…you’ve got everyone up in a dither…” the man’s voice cooed. Dripping in a soothing Anglo-Saxon lilt, “…<em>Venus.</em>”</p>
<p>“Zoicite…,”  murmured the Star before pulling herself from the top of the piano,  “…Please don’t call me that – But I’m glad you finally made it.” Her  eyes turned to regard the silver-haired, debonair man. He had been  reborn and recast as a star in his own right. Spawning an immense  following in Europe, he was slated to appear for a duet with her.</p>
<p>Cerulean-Silver pools rested upon Minako, searching her face before nodding, “You know how beauty sleep goes…”</p>
<p>Suddenly  with dramatic flare, the once gentle chime of the piano had begun to  crescendo into a blaring mosh of clashing notes. Zoicite’s gaze darted  towards a particular area and as if on queue, Terry had made his way  into the mammoth stadium. Clad all in black, the football star wound  his way near the stage. He barely offered niceties to those he passed  and settled into a seat.</p>
<p>Confused Minako trailed Zoicite’s gaze  straight towards a familiar sight – a casual bob of Terry’s head was  given towards her, she replied with a meek smile. A soft, yet audible  groan escaped her lips not soon after, “…I was hoping he’d sleep <em>in</em> today…” That garnered a chuckle from the pianist.</p>
<p>“Lover’s tit for tat, then?” iterated Zoicite.</p>
<p>With  a shake of her head as her eyes skimmed the sheaf of music in her  grasp, Minako offered, “It’s…it was childish really. Nothing I couldn’t  handle.” The silver haired Pianist had a knack for drawing out what  vexed Minako when she least expected. And that bothered her; she had  grown accustomed to offering vague replies. Zoicite was her proverbial <em>irritating sibling. </em>The singer drew her gaze down to check the timepiece graced about her slender wrist.</p>
<p>“It’s  the same time since last you looked. A minute ahead perhaps…” mused  Zoicite, “…but still the same hour. Are we planning to leave me after  we’ve JUST been reuinited…?”</p>
<p>Minako chuckled.</p>
<p>“I’ll take that, as a <em>yes.</em> And where are you going?”</p>
<p>“It’s not your business, is it?”</p>
<p>His  fingers flared to life once more, making love to the keys and eliciting  melodical, haunting chords that seemed to lay those who heard it, into  a trance. Zoicite was a master. He laughed.</p>
<p>“Au contraire, amor…It <em>becomes</em> my business if you stick me with Mister, ‘I-have-Minako-Aino-and-You-don’t,’…I’d like to know at <em>least </em>how to fend for myself.”</p>
<p>“An outing with a friend,” she tested.</p>
<p>“Hence the fight?”</p>
<p>“No…yes…no. <em>Somewhat.</em>”</p>
<p>Zoicite turned his ghostly eyes to regard Terry. As always the muscle bound lout –<em>handsome as he was –</em> had kept his possessive eyes pinioned upon Minako. The Star’s gaze  remained rooted on the music sheets in her hands. If she noticed,  Zoicite had no idea.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised he’s letting you off the leash…”</p>
<p>Minako lifted her eyes…locking them with Zoicite’s own.</p>
<p>With a cluck of his tongue to the roof of his mouth, Zoicite remarked knowingly, “Oh…he <em>isn’t</em> is he? My my my…You’re actually going to <em>run</em> from him for once. Whoever this friend is…<em>must</em> be worth it.”</p>
<p>In  them beyond the hurt he delivered he saw that she knew it to be true.  Aino Minako was a person of extreme pride – but someone had stripped  that from her. In the entertainment world, rumors circled. It didn’t  take too long to hear the juice on the Japanese Star. She had been tied  to an American icon. He was known not only for his fickle womanizing,  but a volatile temper that <em>always</em> got physical. Terry had been the first to show Minako the benefit of a touch.</p>
<p>“That…that was <em>crass</em>, even for you.”</p>
<p>He shrugged, “You owe him nothing.”</p>
<p>Minako replied with a scoff and a muttered, “Except <em>everything.</em>”</p>
<p>The  platinum blonde continued to bathe the stage in a soft sonata. Zoicite  and the Singer had a complex relationship, made similar for the love of  music that they shared and their otherworldly need to keep his master  to her princess apart at all costs. But…that scenario played itself  out. Now they share a competitive nature to best the other on the song  charts. How they Loved to Hate to Love one another.</p>
<p>“What I consider crass is the fact you’re holding on, <em>just</em> because you think you <em>need</em> to.” Zoicite paused as the stage director edged into view and signaled  for the duo to begin the first strains of the soundchecks. He  acknowledged with a singular arc of his silvery brow before continuing  candidly, “For one who champions <em>Love</em>, you need a few lessons in it.”</p>
<p>Minako laughed, lowering her gaze back unto the sheet music replying softly, “…Tell me again, Zoicite – <em>I </em>need a lesson in love…while <em>you</em> cuddle a body pillow every night?”</p>
<p>He  grinned, while he absently pressed the ivory keys with much more fervor  than realized, “Touche…” his eyes darted to the beginning bars of the  music – the sounds of the newest song to be released in a few weeks  soon dressed the stage.</p>
<p>“How apropos – Let’s take it from this verse Minako-chan,” began Zoicite.</p>
<p>‘…<em>I only want you happy…even if it’s not with me…</em></p>
<p>…<em>Maybe one day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see.’ </em></p>
<p>…<em>Only time will tell, the mystery has yet to unfold</em></p>
<p>…<em>Who’s gonna feel the warmth </em></p>
<p>…<em>And the other left in the cold?’</em></p>
<p>“Do the words <em>Venus Love Me Chain</em> mean anything in you?”, she threatened.</p>
<p>“All too vividly. Let’s try another song….”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Her  reflection mocked her. Even through the rear-view mirror of Usagi’s car  it still did. This was the first day that she had awoken with a start –  one that wasn’t induced by her cryptic portends guised in macabre  dreams. But instead, she woke with a knot in her belly her body wracked  with nervous tension. Because, the raven-haired woman knew…It would  just be her and the Singer today, doing...whatever Minako wished. The  others <em>claimed</em> they were busy.</p>
<p>“You look like a grump, Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>She scoffed sarcastically, “Tell me how you <em>really</em> feel.”</p>
<p>“I thought I just did?”, sincerely replied Usagi.</p>
<p>Makoto  turned her body to face Rei, the tallest senshi in the car chuckled  amusedly as the miko fiddled with her leg brace, “At least it’s not  broken. But you’ll need to leave that brace on until the tendon relaxes  once more, leave it alone Rei.” Wrought with motherly instincts, the  brunette reached forth and smacked the miko’s deft fingers away from  the Velcro leashing.</p>
<p>Rei pulled back with a sharp intake of her  breath. Her lips thinned, but to her dismay, Usagi and Makoto both  grinned all the more toothily. They were in too good a mood. And it  bothered her. Rolling her eyes irately, Rei cast her eyes towards the  outside, they drew closer towards their destination apparently, because  Usagi began talking to herself for the right directions.</p>
<p>“Thank you…for putting me up, Makoto.”</p>
<p>“They were willing to switch, Terry-cha--…”</p>
<p>Rei visibly went rigid, quickly Makoto rectified as she continued.</p>
<p>“…Lapps-san was willing to be in a hotel.”</p>
<p>The  miko was quiet for only a minute but within that time unwarranted  images spurred into her mind. There they slept on her futons, she  didn’t want to think of what else occurred. With a shake of her head,  she answered indifferently, “They were there before I arrived.  Wouldn’t’ve been…<em>right.</em>”</p>
<p>The car eased to a halt, bringing  Rei further out of her webbed thoughts. Her eyes searched the area  before her. The skyline boasted a prominent structure; looking as if it  were being held together by Popsicle sticks. Soon screams were exalted  towards the crystalline blue skies of Japan. Lowering her eyes,  balloons tailed helplessly in little children’s hands as they paraded  on the grounds with their parental units.</p>
<p>“An <em>amusement</em> park?”</p>
<p>Usagi  grinned, “Hai. This is the place Minako said to meet.” Then a sharp  pain surged at her side – she was just elbowed! Rather harshly at that.  Wide eyed the bunned woman turned her eyes towards Makoto, the source,  realizing what she had previously stated. Quickly she amended, “…to  meet you, that is... because…<em>we</em> have to get to work. Like. Right now.” she rushed to explain.</p>
<p><em>A lame excuse</em>, thought Rei. But none the less reluctantly went along with the <em>game</em>.</p>
<p>Pushing  her shoulder to the door, Rei eased herself from the car, suddenly  feeling rather self-conscience about herself. As if reading her mind,  Usagi offered encouragingly,</p>
<p>“You look fine, Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see you in a few,” added Makoto.</p>
<p>In  less than a batting of an eye and nevermind saying her goodbyes, the  little vehicle sped off leaving Rei in a cloud of debris filled haze.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Usagi  turned the wheel sharply at the suggestion of Makoto’s and slid  haphazardly into a freed parking space. The odango haired woman arced a  brow at her long time friend.</p>
<p>Makoto nodded, and pulled out a bag pregnant with extra clothes. “The essentials: baseball cap, jeans, pullovers and jackets.”</p>
<p>“We’re set, let’s go!”</p>
