&quot;Chibi chibi biiiyyyyaaatch!&quot;

&quot;(Groan) what do we do now Taru-chan?&quot; Chibi Usa asked desperately.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the Senshi of Death sighed, &quot;Our best bet would probably 
be to ask Ami for help, but she&#39;s busy studying for her stupid medical 
exams.&quot;

&quot;Terrific,&quot; the future princess said acerbically.

&quot;Chibi chibi biiiyyyyaaatch.&quot;

&quot;What about Setsuna?&quot; Chibi Usa asked, &quot;Next to Ami, your Setsuna-mama&#39;s 
probably the smartest Senshi around.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Hotaru began, &quot;Unfortunately, Setsuna-mama isn&#39;t here right 
now.&quot;

&quot;Really? Well, where is she?&quot;

------

The timegate suddenly appeared outside of Arisugawa&#39;s Locket as two 
figures, one wearing a fuku and another wearing a toga, emerged outside 
the popular nightclub.

&quot;Now look,&quot; Sailor Pluto said sternly, &quot;I&#39;m going against my better 
judgment doing this, but because you&#39;ve been behaving yourself recently, 
and it&#39;s your birthday, I&#39;ll let you spend some time here again. But you 
have to agree to leave when I say so. Deal?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; the attractive Greek said, &quot;deal.&quot;

&quot;Good. I&#39;ll leave you here; there are rules against two or more Sailor 
Plutos occupying the same space at the same time, and there&#39;s already 
one here in Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. Behave yourself!&quot; the Time Senshi added 
sternly before disappearing back into the timegate.

Sappho watched her disappear with a smile, and entered through the 
Locket&#39;s main entrance. Her grin widened as she felt the eyes gazing 
upon her. She made her way through the crowd, stopping when she got to a 
jukebox in the corner. When the song that was currently playing stopped, 
she went up to it and hit the top of the machine. Suddenly music began 
playing out of it as if by magic. Turning away from the jukebox, she 
snapped her fingers, and was instantly swarmed by gushing young women 
all trying to get close to her.

&quot;Heyyyy,&quot; she said, sticking her thumbs up as she put her arms around 
the two nearest ladies.

------

&quot;Well look,&quot; Chibi Usa said, &quot;I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m getting 
hungry. We&#39;re not going to be able to think of anything on an empty 
stomach.&quot;

Hotaru smirked, &quot;You really are Usagi&#39;s daughter, aren&#39;t you,&quot; she asked 
teasingly as her pink-haired girlfriend looked through the telephone 
directory for takeout food joints.

&quot;Oh har har,&quot; Chibi Usa said good naturedly as she picked up the phone 
and began dialing, &quot;Hello, Tokyo Pizza Emporium? I&#39;d like to order...&quot;

&quot;Hello,&quot; a pleasant-sounding woman&#39;s voice said on the other line, 
&quot;You&#39;ve reached the Goddess Technical Help Line.&quot;

Hotaru, noticing the strange look on Chibi Usa&#39;s face, brought her ear 
up to the phone to try to catch the conversation.

&quot;A goddess will be dispatched momentarily to fulfill your request,&quot; the 
voice said before the phone suddenly went dead.

Both Hotaru and Chibi Usa gave each other a worried look. Before either 
could say anything, the wall mirror in the Outer&#39;s living room began to 
glow, and a cute looking teenager who appeared to be roughly the same 
age as Chibi Usa and Hotaru emerged, her dark hair flowing down her back 
and a large mallet held over her shoulder.

&quot;Okay,&quot; the newcomer said slightly annoyed, &quot;Which one of you pulled me 
away from my big sister&#39;s side?&quot;

&quot;Wh... What in th...&quot; Chibi Usa stuttered out. The girl reached into a 
pocket and proceeded to pull out a card which she promptly handed over 
to the tongue tied princess. Hotaru glanced at the card over her 
girlfriend&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Skuld,&quot; the Senshi of Death read, &quot;Goddess Second Class, First 
Category, Limited License,&quot; Hotaru looked up after reading it, and saw 
the goddess looking around at the Outer&#39;s living room, her eyes lighting 
up when she came to a display of trophies her Haruka-papa had won in 
races.

Eventually, the newcomer&#39;s gaze fell upon the youngest person in the 
room.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she said, smiling down at the little girl, &quot;My name&#39;s Skuld, 
who might you be?&quot;

Chibi Chibi&#39;s eyes widened as she saw the beautiful visitor from the 
mirror bend down to address her. The goddess had an attractive face and 
large brown eyes. This new girl looked nice, and Chibi Chibi smiled as 
she thought of how wonderful it would be to have a playmate like her to 
play dolls with.

&quot;Chibi Chibi biiiyyyyaaatch!&quot; the toddler answered, at which point Chibi 
Usa buried her face in her hands and Hotaru blushed embarrassedly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, she... Well...&quot; Chibi Usa began, &quot;You see, we&#39;ve been trying 
to get her to stop that, but...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; the goddess said reassuringly before turning back to the 
other two in the room, &quot;Anyways, you dialed the Goddess Technical Help 
Line, so I&#39;ve been sent here to grant you one wish. I&#39;ll warn you now, 
though, I&#39;m only a second class goddess, so go easy on me. I can help 
you with debugging your computer, or fixing up a rocket to go to the 
moon with by using stuff you might have in the attic...&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Hotaru asked, visibly impressed, &quot;You could actually do that?&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Skuld asked smugly, &quot;MacGuyver has nothing on me! 
I...&quot;

As the conversation between the goddess and the two Senshi continued, 
Chibi Chibi frowned a bit; she wanted to play with the new girl. &quot;Chibi 
chibi biiiyyyyaaatch!&quot; she said a bit more forcefully, tugging at 
Skuld&#39;s hem as she did so.

Skuld looked down at the little girl, and sighed, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t keep 
saying naughty words,&quot; the goddess said, &quot;Or else, no one will want to 
play with you or be your friend.&quot;

The toddler suddenly looked like she wanted to cry. After a few seconds, 
she held her arms up to the young teen, &quot;Chibi chibi!&quot; she cried, &quot;Chibi 
chibi!&quot;

Skuld smiled at the kawaii little girl as she picked her up, &quot;That&#39;s 
better,&quot; she said. The goddess was then taken aback a bit as Chibi Chibi 
hugged her, little hearts showing in the pink-haired girl&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Hotaru said with a smile, &quot;You&#39;re terrific with her. She really 
seems to like you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Chibi Usa chimed in, &quot;I wish she could have a friend like you 
around all the time.&quot;

No sooner were the words out of her mouth than a strong wind began to 
blow in the living room.

&quot;Oh no.&quot; the future princess groaned as she realized what she&#39;d done.

Meanwhile, Skuld set Chibi Chibi down as she was suddenly enveloped in 
energy, the wind almost becoming a mini tornado as it whirled around the 
goddess. As the young goddess began to glow and levitate above the 
floor, a huge beam of energy suddenly shot from her through the roof of 
the Outer&#39;s mansion, lighting up the sky as it ascended into the 
stratosphere. As the fireworks finally ended and the pretty goddess 
slumped to the floor exhausted, the toddler in the room ran to her.

&quot;Chibi chibi,&quot; she laughed, clapping her hands at the fun light show her 
new friend had just put on for her, &quot;Chibi Chibi.&quot;

Hotaru looked around the living room in shock as she noted the 
devastation left behind in the wake of the whirlwind, &quot;Haruka-papa&#39;s 
going to kill us,&quot; she moaned. As Chibi Usa put a comforting hand on her 
girlfriend&#39;s shoulder, she turned to look out at the audience.

&quot;While we try to sort this mess out,&quot; the pink-haired girl said, &quot;You 
folks out there go and read the next omake. Someone challenged the 
author to write one without dialogue, and the fool decided to accept. 
With our apologies to the Charlie Chaplin estate, here&#39;s omake 
thirty-one. Enjoy.&quot;

---Omake Thirty-One: The Silent Movie---

The scene opened to the exterior of a house being filmed in black and 
white. As lighthearted violin music began, a figure came in from off 
screen dressed in a bowler hat, a tight jacket, oversized pants and 
shoes, and carrying a cane that was being swung around as she walked. 
The tramp-like figure, whose long black hair flowed freely down her 
back, was obviously not the wealthiest person in the world, yet seemed 
cheerful nonetheless.

She turned to the camera and smiled as she tipped her hat. She pointed 
at a small bouquet of flowers in her hand, then pointed over to the 
house where her sweetheart lived. She then closed her eyes as she held 
both hands over her heart, smiling broadly at the thought of the young 
lady living there.

The music suddenly changed, becoming heavier and a bit ominous as a 
figure in a tuxedo showed up wearing a cape and top hat. He looked 
snidely over at the poor young woman and her pitiful little flowers, and 
then looked to his own large bouquet of roses. Turning his nose up to 
her, he began to head to the door. The young woman, not willing to be 
deterred, followed close behind.

As both the rich man and poor woman knocked on the door, the dark haired 
young lady held her flowers behind her back, unaware of her rival who 
was reaching behind her with a pair of scissors.

The door opened as a liltingly beautiful violin and piano duet played, 
and Tsukino Usagi appeared in the doorway. She was surprised to see her 
two suitors, Chiba Mamoru and Hino Rei, both showing up at once. The 
poor girl smiled at the adorable looking blonde as she tipped her hat 
and pulled her hand out from behind her back to reveal a group of stems 
that had the flowers cut off of them.

As Usagi looked at her female suitor strangely, the rich young man hid 
his scissors in his cloak as he pulled out his own bouquet of long stem 
roses. Rei turned to look out at the audience, the frustration in her 
face showing that she obviously knew something was up. Usagi invited her 
suitors to come inside, and Mamoru immediately followed, shutting the 
door on Rei before she could get in.

Inside, Usagi placed Mamoru&#39;s roses in a vase and then went into the 
kitchen as the wealthy young man sat down on the couch in the living 
room. The front door opened, and Rei entered rubbing her nose where the 
door slammed into it. As she walked in, her toes pointing outward as she 
swung her cane, she and her rival exchanged angry glances. She took a 
seat and removed her bowler hat as Usagi emerged from the other room 
with two lemonades for her suitors.

Rei smiled as she sipped the drink, thanking the beautiful young woman 
who stole her heart as Usagi sat one space away from Mamoru on the 
couch. Mamoru immediately began to try to sweet talk the blonde, 
pointing out his rich clothes and heavy bank account before pointing at 
his romantic rival with a disdainful laugh. Usagi quickly reminded him, 
however, that wealth wasn&#39;t everything. After all, her family was 
wealthy, but wealth could not fill an empty heart.

Mamoru was about to try to argue the point further, when the pretty 
blonde remembered she forgot to bring out the cake in the kitchen for 
them to all enjoy with their lemonade. The camera suddenly gave a 
close-up of Mamoru&#39;s face, his eyes looking left to right as he stroked 
his chin schemingly. He then made the suggestion of sending Rei in to 
get the cake. Usagi nodded her head and politely asked the dark haired 
young woman. Rei, though reluctant to leave the woman she&#39;d fallen in 
love with alone in the room with the rich playboy, complied and went 
into the kitchen.

She returned a few seconds later with the large cake, only to have the 
devious Mamoru stick his cane out to trip her. Rei fell and the cake 
went flying through the air as it left her hands. It landed in Usagi&#39;s 
face, covering the blonde in chocolate frosting.

As Usagi started to wipe the mess off her face, Rei decided she&#39;d had 
enough of the jerk trying to steal the blonde&#39;s heart. She challenged 
him to a fight, only to end up with him holding her back with his hand 
on her forehead as she swung away, unable to hit him.

Usagi now stepped angrily forward, tears of embarrassment falling down 
her cheeks as she told Rei to get out of her house and never come back. 
She called her a common clod, and told her that she hoped to never see 
the poor girl again. Sad music began to play as the dark-haired woman 
hung her head mournfully and left the house.

As Rei sadly wandered the streets, Usagi went to wash the chocolate from 
her face and change into clean clothes. As she was about to reenter the 
living room, she overheard a phone conversation Mamoru was having with a 
friend. He laughingly told his friend on the other line about how he 
made his rival look ridiculous in front of the blonde, and how her 
family&#39;s money was practically his already.

Usagi was shocked; Mamoru was nothing more than a gold digger! Worse, he 
made her throw out someone who truly loved her for her, and not for her 
family&#39;s fortune. She stormed into the room, angrily accusing him of 
being a scoundrel before running out of the house to find the attractive 
poor girl who was in love with her. Mamoru immediately rushed out to try 
and stop her...

And was killed by the streetcar he didn&#39;t see coming.

Meanwhile, Rei was still sadly wandering the Tokyo streets as she fought 
back her tears. Something caught her ear, and she looked behind her to 
see Usagi running down the sidewalk after her. The blonde flung her arms 
around the pretty girl as happy violin and piano music began to play. 
Usagi told Rei that she now realized Mamoru had tried to trick her, and 
she was sorry for the things she said.

Rei smiled as she took her bowler hat off and leaned towards the 
blonde&#39;s face, holding the hat so that it obscured the kiss the two of 
them shared. The poor girl then gentlemanly offered her arm to Usagi, 
who put her dainty hand in the crook of her dark-haired love&#39;s arm.

The two then walked off into the sunset, to live happily ever after.
