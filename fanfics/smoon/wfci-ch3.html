to call a hint ^_^) On with the fanfiction! Oh this ======== means a 
scene change.
____________________

&quot;Rei, what the hell are we supposed to teach her? She told us she&#39;s 
never done anything bad, and I believe her, personally.&quot; Rei gazed at 
Makoto for a moment before frowning in annoyance. &quot;I dunno! Teach her 
how to pickpocket, or something! She sure as hell isn&#39;t about to run 
around here playing &quot;princess&quot; while we do all the work! Get Minako to 
teach her how to hotwire space cruisers.&quot; She grinned for a moment at 
the thought, and then resumed her serious expression. &quot;Maybe she could 
help you in the kitchen.&quot; Makoto stared at her in shock. &quot;Hell no! I&#39;m 
not about to let her destroy my kitchen! You teach her something! You 
are the boss, remember?&quot; Rei let her mind drift to exactly what she 
could teach Serenity. Oh, the possibilities. Maybe the girl could be 
her personal masseuse, or... &quot;Rei?&quot; Makoto saying her name in concern 
knocked Rei out of her reverie. The tall green haired woman cocked her 
head to one side, studying Rei quizzically. &quot;You alright? You kinda 
spaced out there.&quot; Rei shook her head, trying to clear her mind of the 
image of Serenity rubbing her back with warm massage oil. She coughed 
a little bit. &#39;Where the hell did that come from?&#39; &quot;I&#39;m alright 
Makoto. Um, yeah, I might teach the kid a few things.&quot; She turned away 
from Makoto to hide the blush that had spread across her face. &quot;Err, 
get out. I need some time to myself.&quot; Makoto rolled her eyes. &quot;Wow, 
how gracious of you to politely let me out of your quarters,&quot; she said 
sarcastically, brushing a strand of green hair away from her face. 
&quot;I&#39;ll be going now. I&#39;ve got to start lunch,&quot; Makoto tossed over her 
shoulder, walking out of Rei&#39;s room and closing the door behind her. 
Rei groaned and sat down in a large red chair. Next to the chair, on a 
small table, sat a single (and very large) bottle of liquor. Rei 
rubbed her temples. &quot;I have gotta stop drinking that stuff...&quot; 

=================

Serenity watched in amusement as Minako attempted to steal one of the 
cookies that Makoto had made without her noticing. Makoto noticed the 
blonde&#39;s movement out of the corner of her eye, and slapped her hand 
away from the cookie tray. Minako yelped, and rubbed her hand. &quot;How do 
you always manage to do that?&quot; Makoto grinned at the frowning blonde. 
&quot;I&#39;m just skilled like that. Sit down, and wait like everyone else.&quot; 
Minako pouted, and sat down next to Ami, who was trying very hard not 
to laugh. &quot;Hmph, everyone picks on me, and I don&#39;t even have Mitsuki 
to protect me today.&quot; Serenity smiled at Minako. &quot;I won&#39;t pick on you 
Minako. Where is Mitsuki anyway?&quot; Minako frowned, and her eyes 
darkened. &quot;She&#39;s on her home planet, trying to talk to her bitch of a 
mother.&quot; The blonde sighed weakly. &quot;I don&#39;t even know why she tries to 
talk to that old broad. She&#39;s just hurting herself.&quot; Serenity stared 
at Minako. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ami shook her head, and Makoto sighed. 
&quot;Now why did you have to go and ask that question, kid? Now she&#39;s 
going to make herself feel guilty.&quot; Minako turned to Serenity, and 
Serenity noticed her eyes had taken on a sort of haunted look. &quot;Well 
Usagi, a long time ago, Mitsuki used to be a really important person 
on her planet. She was...is the daughter of the general of the 
Imperial Army of Ni, her home world. Well, thanks to me, her parents 
basically disowned her, and now she&#39;s stuck here with us.&quot; She shook 
her head sadly. &quot;She...she tries to act as if it doesn&#39;t bother her, 
but I can see how much she misses her home. Hell, my parents know I&#39;m 
a criminal, but I can still go home and visit them.&quot; Minako sniffled a 
little bit. &quot;I just feel so bad. Sometimes,&quot; her voice dropped to a 
whisper, &quot;sometimes I wish she would stay there. At least she would be 
happy, and she could find somebody else. She&#39;s pretty enough, you 
know.&quot; Serenity put a comforting hand on Minako&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
think she&#39;s happy here, with you? If she wasn&#39;t, then she wouldn&#39;t be 
here.&quot; 

Makoto and Ami nodded in agreement. &quot;Usagi is right, Minako. Mitsuki 
cares for you very much. She&#39;s happy just being with you,&quot; Ami said, 
smiling at the blonde woman. Minako nodded her head somberly. &quot;Yeah, I 
guess you&#39;re right. I wish she would come back, though.&quot; As if on cue, 
Mitsuki walked into the kitchen. Serenity noticed that she had her 
hand covering one side of her face. She gave everyone a strained 
smile, and kissed Minako on the cheek before she sat down. Makoto 
frowned at her. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong with your face?&quot; Minako turned to 
Mitsuki, and stared at her in concern. &quot;Yeah, why are you covering 
your face like that?&quot; Mitsuki shot Makoto a dirty glare. &quot;Err...it&#39;s 
nothing Mina-chan.&quot; Minako&#39;s eyes darkened, and she frowned. &quot;You&#39;re 
lying. Let me see your face.&quot; Mitsuki glared at Minako. &quot;I&#39;m alright 
Minako. Leave me alone, &quot; she said, walking out of the kitchen. Minako 
shook her head. &quot;She&#39;ll probably tell me later.&quot; Serenity frowned. 
&quot;Her parents must be awful.&quot; Minako just looked down at the table. 
&quot;Yeah&cedil; they really are...&quot;

==================

Michiru watched Haruka warily out of the corner of her eye. &quot;Haruka, 
sit down. You&#39;re making me nervous with all of that pacing.&quot; Haruka 
sighed, and sat down on the couch with Michiru. &quot;I just don&#39;t get it 
Michiru. Where could that kid have gone? I mean, she probably hasn&#39;t 
been anywhere but the Moon, so she probably wouldn&#39;t know anyone on an 
outside planet, and I don&#39;t think she was kidnapped.&quot; Michiru stared 
at Haruka curiously. &quot;And why not?&quot; Haruka frowned. &quot;Well, it just 
doesn&#39;t...feel right. I met her fianc&eacute;. I think she was trying to run 
away from him, you know?&quot; Michiru snuggled up next to Haruka. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry about it. You&#39;ll find her.&quot; Haruka sighed weakly. &quot;I better, 
because my job depends on it....&quot;

==================

Setsuna sat in the driver&#39;s seat of her space cruiser, and looked over 
at Hotaru. &quot;Hotaru, if you were a runaway socialite, where would you 
go?&quot; The purple haired girl smirked. &quot;Why Mars, of course. No one 
would dare look for a spoiled little rich brat there.&quot; Setsuna smiled, 
and her blood-red eyes flashed mysteriously. &quot;Mars it is then,&quot; she 
murmured, turning on the ignition...

==================

Minako, Mitsuki, Ami, Makoto, Rei, and Serenity sat at various places 
in the living room, watching the news. Serenity had been quite 
surprised to discover that the &quot;bar&quot; was actually built up like a 
house. Her gaze flicked over to Rei, who was sitting in a chair with 
her eyes half closed. Serenity smiled a bit. &#39;She certainly is 
attractive, with all that red hair, and those lovely violet eyes, not 
to mention she&#39;s got a magnificent body...&#39; &quot;Hey kid!&quot; Rei glaring at 
her stopped Serenity&#39;s reverie short. The red haired girl smirked. &quot;Do 
you think you could stop ogling me?&quot; Serenity blushed. &quot;Oh! I&#39;m...I&#39;m 
so sorry, really.&quot; Rei chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I know I&#39;m sexy.&quot; 
Serenity&#39;s eyes widened, and she turned away from Rei. Luckily for 
Serenity, all of the other girls were to busy staring at the TV screen 
to notice the conversation. Serenity decided to watch the news too. 
Staring at Rei was too dangerous. &quot;...And now for our top story,&quot; the 
anchorwoman said. Serenity&#39;s picture popped up on the screen. &quot;This 
young woman, Serenity Loned, has supposedly been kidnapped. If you 
have any information on this woman, please call this number.&quot; A number 
flashed on the screen, and Makoto reached for the phone, as if to call 
the number. When she noticed the glares she was getting, she rose her 
hands in defense. &quot;Hey, I was just kidding! You people can&#39;t take a 
joke?&quot; Minako frowned at her. &quot;Shut up! The news is still on.&quot; The 
anchorwoman continued after the number flashed off of the screen. 
&quot;Sources say that she was last seen with Minako Nedal, who is a member 
of the notorious gang, the Phoenixes.&quot; Minako&#39;s picture popped up on 
the screen, and Minako made a strangled noise in the back of her 
throat. Rei glared at her angrily. &quot;I thought you said nobody saw 
you!&quot; Minako&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;There wasn&#39;t! But oh...&quot; Rei glowered at 
her. &quot;Oh what?&quot; Minako looked at her feet. &quot;There wasn&#39;t anyone on the 
street, but there were people in the space cruiser.&quot; She yelped as Rei 
made a lunge for her. 

The anchorwoman continued her report, and Makoto turned up the volume 
to try to drown out the sounds of Minako&#39;s wailing, Rei screaming at 
Minako, and Mitsuki struggling to pull Rei off of Minako. &quot;Some of the 
best police officials are on the case, as well as the two galaxy 
renowned bounty hunters, Hotaru and Setsuna Desal.&quot; Rei momentarily 
stopped strangling Minako, and she paled. &quot;No way in hell they&#39;ve got 
those two looking for you Minako?! Man, we are gonna die. I only hope 
they didn&#39;t see the newscast.&quot; The girls barely noticed the TV and the 
anchorwoman who finished her piece on Serenity, smiled, and said, &quot;And 
now for the weather...&quot; 

=================

Hotaru chuckled as the anchorwoman finished her piece on Serenity&#39;s 
&#39;kidnapping.&#39; &quot;Setsuna-mama, the news has made our job very easy, no?&quot; 
Then she frowned, and ran her fingers through her hair. &quot;But we won&#39;t 
have to hurt Minako-chan and the others, will we?&quot; Setsuna smiled. &quot;Of 
course not dear.&quot; Then her eyes hardened. 

&quot;That is, unless, they are not cooperative...&quot;
