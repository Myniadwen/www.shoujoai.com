<h1>Plus de Compassion (More Than Sympathy) (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/plusde-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The sun shine from a cloudless sky, the first birds returned from 
their long journey from the south. Slowly the branches of the trees 
got greener and all plants in Japan stood in blossom. Spring came and 
bought wonderful weather with it. The snow disappeared and the bitter 
cold was dispelled by a nice warm breeze. Soft wind played with the 
white curtains near the open window. Bright light flood the blank 
underground and soon it looked like a river of rainbows.

&#147;Your boyfriend&#146;s coming.&#148; Declared the nurse and returned from the 
window to her patient. The girl laid on a mat on the ground and tried 
hard to move her weak legs. But they didn&#146;t even shake. They laid 
there on the cold ground. Motionless. Dead.

&#147;You&#146;re doing well.&#148; Said the nurse and smiled at her with her knowing 
smile Michiru begun to hate during the last months. The young 
violinist knew that the nurse wanted to help her but with every week 
that passed without big progress, Michiru started to believe that they 
all told her a silly fairy tale. That even the doctor lied to her when 
he told her that there was a slight chance that she would ever be able 
to walk again &#150; even if it was just with the help of crutches. 

&#147;You made big progresses during the last weeks. Guess it&#146;s the nice 
weather. Your body can feel it, too.&#148; Michiru just rolled her eyes as 
she heard the happy words.

There&#146;s no progress I&#146;ve ever made. All I achieved is that I can go to 
the toilette without peeing on the tiles! Now I can dress myself 
without being strangled by the pullover! Now I can take my shoes 
without falling out of that bloody wheelchair! Now I can watch other 
people running by while I keep sitting...

Michiru wanted to kick the woman away. She wanted to beat her down. 
But she wasn&#146;t even able to run away.

&#147;Hello, Mrs. Araki.&#148; Haruka entered the room and bowed before the 
nurse. &#147;Am I too earlier?&#148; Two green eyes looked concerned down into 
angry blue ones.

&#147;No, we&#146;re just ready. Miss Kaioh is doing very well.&#148; The nurse 
smiled as Haruka helped her girlfriend into the wheelchair and gave 
her the brown jacket. Although it was a very nice spring day it could 
be very fresh, especially at the Mugen Gakkuen near the sea.

&#147;Sure...&#148; 

Haruka looked up as she heard the silent voice next to her. The 
cynicism in it. The pain.

With another bow Haruka opened the door while Michiru kept her head 
down as they left the hospital. The taller girl didn&#146;t ask. She felt 
that her girlfriend needed some time to think. That was the way she 
always had treated her problems.

Until the one problem that&#146;s too big to be handled...

&#147;There&#146;re some training at the arena near Mugen Gakkuen. You know 
there&#146;ll be contests between Mugen Gakkuen and other schools in 
summer. And the famous school wants to win.&#148; Declared Haruka the black 
tracksuit she was wearing while she put the wheelchair into the boot 
and took place behind the steering wheel.

&#147;May I come with you?&#148; Still Michiru didn&#146;t look up and suddenly 
Haruka regretted that she accept the offer of her athletics&#39; club to 
fight at the contents for Mugen Gakkuen. The young racer reached for 
her girlfriend&#146;s ice cold hands in her lap and hold them tenderly. 
Sadly she smiled as Michiru didn&#146;t look up yet. She leaned forward and 
gave her a quick kiss on the left cheek.

&#147;Of course.&#148; 

***

Her usual pale face was redden and the wind played with her long sea 
green hairs. A soft blanket covered her legs but she didn&#146;t even think 
about her handicapped body now. All she thought about were the 
pictures in her head. A sketchbook laid in her lap and her fingers 
glided over the paper as if the pen would stroke it. The picture of a 
young woman evolved on the white underground. A girl who bet all her 
opponents. Her feet didn&#146;t even touch the ground when she run and the 
wind seemed to be with her. Her short hair looked messed and a tomboy 
expression laid on her face while she crossed the finish line &#150; as a 
winner.

Michiru raised her head and watched how Haruka run with the others in 
circles to warm herself up. Happy green eyes met thoughtful blue ones. 
Then Haruka raised her hand and winked at her.

&#147;Amazing. Normally he doesn&#146;t notice anyone when he does his 
training.&#148;

Michiru winced because she didn&#146;t hear him coming. She looked up and 
blinked against the sun. Of course she knew about Tsukasa. And of 
course she heard how he treated Haruka. Mostly the young racer didn&#146;t 
tell about it by herself. Mostly Michiru got to know about the newest 
fights from Rumiko or from a team colleague.

&#147;You must be the cripple, Ayako mentions so often.&#148;

Michiru took a deep breathe then she concentrated again on her 
picture. Her hand trembled slightly but she did so many drawings that 
she was almost a profi.

&#147;Go away.&#148; She whispered and begun to shade the environment. But he 
leaned forward and before she could react he hold the sketchbook in 
his hands. He stepped back and she couldn&#146;t follow him so fast over 
the stony underground. &#147;Give it back!&#148; she demanded but at the same 
time she knew that he would never obey her.

&#147;You&#146;re not only a cripple.&#148; He declared and looked at the drawled 
girl. Tsukasa raised his head and watch Haruka how he run through the 
arena. The boy was very fast. Almost as fast as the wind as some guys 
whispered behind his back. And he was definitely not a girl! &#147;You&#146;re 
also a pervert.&#148; Tsukasa threw the sketchbook on the dirty ground and 
stepped on the white paper as Michiru reached for it.

&#147;Why...?&#148; she frowned and looked up to him with an empty expression on 
her beautiful face that made him automatically shiver. The young 
violinist stared for some seconds at the sketchbook under his feet, 
then she shrugged her shoulders and reached for the wheels. She wanted 
to turn away. To leave this place. To escape forever.

But he didn&#146;t let her go. Tsukasa grabbed the handlebars of the 
wheelchair and wanted to say something. But he was interrupted by a 
low, quiet but very sharp voice.

&#147;Leave her in peace!&#148;

He raised his head and looked into two angry shinning green eyes that 
normally seemed so uninterested. So detached. So absent. Haruka pushed 
him aside and stepped protectively between the wheelchair and Tsukasa. 
Her fists were clenched and the determined expression on her slightly 
redden face made clear that she would beat him if he ever tried to 
hurt the handicapped girl.

Tsukasa stared from the fast boy to the slow girl and back. He winced 
as Haruka grabbed the sketchbook and gave it back to the smaller girl. 
Shortly they exchanged glances but Tsukasa was sure that there was 
more between them but just a short look. Michiru shook her head and 
smiled sadly at the dirty paper while Haruka took a deep breathe. She 
opened her fists as she returned to Tsukasa.

&#147;Next Friday after school. Here. Then you&#146;ll get your silly battle.&#148; 
Haruka declared with her icy voice and took the handlebars of the 
wheelchair.

&#147;Haruka! Our training isn&#146;t over yet!&#148; shouted another pupil from the 
team but the girl only waved her hand. &#147;I trained enough for today.&#148; 
She shouted back and the two strange pupils left the arena. They 
always seemed to isolate themselves from the other pupils and 
obviously they didn&#146;t want any society from their fellow students. 
Both of them were silent and mysterious. They talked to a few people 
but often they were alone. Often it seemed as if they didn&#146;t need 
anything else than each other.

Tsukasa watched them very confused as they left the arena and headed 
towards the big towers of Mugen Gakkuen. Confused and surprised. 
Because this was the first time that Ten&ocirc; Haruka cared for anything. 
He never reacted when he shouted at this silly boy. He never looked up 
when Tsukasa beat him or pushed his books to the ground. He terrorised 
the reserved boy for so many weeks now and he never cared about it. He 
just passed by when he could and disappeared silent between the other 
pupils. He never defended himself or shouted back. Until today...

Tsukasa was very surprised. With a sudden Haruka accepted the contest. 
Just because he treated that handicapped girl.

Strange...

Tsukasa frowned and looked down at his hands that had hold the crazy 
picture the smaller girl had drawn.

It was the first time that this cool boy had been concerned about 
someone. And of all people, this someone was the cripple half of the 
girls hated.

***

The water was fresh but she liked it that way. Cool wind was playing 
with the waves as she walked out of them. Her black swimsuit fitted 
perfectly to her slim body. She returned and faced the wide ocean 
behind. The sun was setting and the horizon burned. The girl sighed 
happily and laid her head in her neck to watch the first stars above. 
She felt her long wet hair in her back and shivered automatically.

&#147;Do you wanna go for a ride?&#148; 

The girl giggled as she heard the known low voice behind. She spun 
around and run towards her best friend. The Suzuki shimmered red in 
the dying daylight. The taller girl already wore her race suit and her 
helmet. She looked up to her and nodded.

&#147;Hai.&#148; She whispered and wondered why she felt so free with a sudden. 
So happy.

Haven&#146;t I been so happy all this time? Wasn&#146;t I always free?

But she didn&#146;t care about her feelings. She simply took seat behind 
the taller girl and wrapped her arms around her waist. The second 
helmet was for her. She knew that the other bought it just for her. 

&#147;Ready?&#148; The motorbike speeded up as she nodded. Wind played with her 
still wet swimsuit and she felt again so free. Like a bird. She leaned 
back and spread her arms wide to enjoy that feeling. She could hear 
the tender laughter she loved so much as she closed her eyes.

&#147;Watch out!&#148;

The girl opened her eyes again as she heard her mother&#146;s scream. She 
sat on the backseat of her parents silver Ferrari. Now she wore a blue 
summer dress and looked terrified out of the front window. Something 
was on the road. She couldn&#146;t define it. Maybe it was a car, maybe it 
was a human being. Maybe it was nothing of them at all. That thing 
shouted at them and then it raised arms that hold so many knifes. The 
edges sparkled in the moon light and she could see the insane shinning 
of eyes that weren&#146;t real eyes. Her father tried to evade that 
something and lost control over the car. He screamed as the silver 
Ferrari turned around and slipped for some seconds on the roof. Then 
there was a wall and a loud crash. Then there was the insane laughter 
of that thing.

Then there was silence. And darkness.

&#147;No!&#148; Michiru sat upright in her bed. She still reached with her hands 
for something that wasn&#146;t there anymore. Sweat covered her pale face 
and her night-dress pasted to her trembling body. The young violinist 
wanted to scream but her throat was too dry to. Tears burned in her 
deep blue eyes and very slowly her nerves calmed down.

Again that terrible nightmare!

She couldn&#146;t remember the time of the accident. It was normal said the 
doctors. Her brain wanted to defend itself before the bad seconds.

Is that the truth? Did this cruel thing happen to my parents? And to 
me?

Michiru looked down at her trembling body and then over to the 
wheelchair that stood motionless beside the bed. Near but still 
unreachable. 

Is that thing guilty for the hell I am living in?

The young violinist took the headphone that laid next to her on the 
pillow and the remote control. She closed her eyes and sighed as the 
sad music evolved in her ears. Michiru touched the remote control and 
the volume increased until the melody filled her whole world. Tears 
sparkled under her lashes but she wasn&#146;t willing to let them fall. 
Crying wouldn&#146;t change anything. She didn&#146;t even fell better 
afterwards. No, she felt worse when she cried. More helpless. Weaker.

Is that thing guilty for my useless body?

She didn&#146;t know. She didn&#146;t find any answer of her questions. Nor did 
she find any sleep for the rest of the night.

***

&#147;What do you think? Who will win?&#148;

&#147;Of course Haruka!&#148;

&#147;Hai, he&#146;s the smartest boy I ever met!&#148;

&#147;Met? You mean saw! He hardly speaks with anyone.&#148;

&#147;But he&#146;s so cute!&#148;

&#147;And he&#146;s so much faster than Tsukasa.&#148;

&#147;But don&#146;t underestimate Tsukasa!&#148;

&#147;Hai, he&#146;s fast, too.&#148;

&#147;But Haruka is faster!&#148;

&#147;Hai!&#148;

Ayako listened to the girls around her while she stood beside the 
track watching the two boys getting ready for their contest. Haruka 
wore her black tracksuit as always. Her green eyes were hidden behind 
sunglasses. She didn&#146;t warm herself up as Tsukasa did. The young racer 
just stood there. Waiting.

One teacher stood next to them. He volunteered to play the referee. 
For him it was a good contest. The boys proved that they were fast 
enough to beat the other school&#146;s pupils in summer.

&#147;Ready?&#148; he asked and the two boys kneeled down on the dirty ground. 
Haruka raised her head for some seconds and looked over to another 
direction. Then she stared at the earth again and took a deep breathe.

Why the hell am I doing this silly competition?

&#147;Steady?&#148;

Automatically she raised her backside and tightened all the muscles in 
her body. The aching disappeared from her belly the last weekend, but 
she knew it would return the next month.

&#147;Go!&#148;

Haruka stopped to think as she started the race. It was arranged that 
they both had to ran two laps of the arena. Who crossed the finish 
line as first racer would win. She heard the cheers of the girls and 
the shouting of the boys next to the them. Almost whole of Mugen 
Gakkuen was here to watch them. Half of the pupils wanted Tsukasa to 
win, the rest, mostly girls, shouted for Haruka.

Ayako frowned as she saw how Haruka raised her head shortly before the 
teacher gave them the start signal. The red haired girl followed the 
look and saw the other girl sitting in her wheelchair. Well hidden in 
the shadows of a huge tree. Ayako bit on her upper lip, then she 
slowly left her friends and walked over to Michiru. The handicapped 
girl didn&#146;t see her come. She sat there and stared concentrated on the 
sketchbook down in her lap. Her fingers flew over the paper and only 
shortly she looked up, watched her boyfriend running and concentrated 
again on the picture. A thin smile laid on her redden face and she 
silently moved her lips to a melody only she could hear.

&#147;Haruka&#146;s very fast.&#148; Declared Ayako and stepped next to the 
wheelchair. The girl winced slightly as if she awoke from a deep 
dream. She didn&#146;t look up and her hands didn&#146;t hesitate on the paper.

&#147;Hai.&#148; Was all Michiru repeated. She took a deep breathe and tried to 
concentrate again on the picture.

Go away!

But she knew Ayako would never leave her alone so easy. And she would 
have betrayed her feelings if she had ever asked her to go. To leave 
her in peace. To leave her alone with the small dream that didn&#146;t die 
last September. 

&#147;And you&#146;re very slowly.&#148; Continued Ayako and Michiru rolled her eyes. 
She knew what would follow. And she knew that she wouldn&#146;t escape the 
offensive words. Not in her wheelchair.

&#147;Don&#146;t you see what you&#146;re doing to him? You trap him in your small 
world. But he has a shinning future, a big destiny. If you don&#146;t stand 
in his way. Can&#146;t you see that he needs his freedom? His 
independence?&#148;

Michiru continued to draw and slightly shook her head.

Don&#146;t you see that Haruka needs carefulness and love?

&#147;He needs someone he can walk with through life, Kaioh Michiru! Walk, 
not roll!&#148;

And you&#146;re this person? Are you really so blind that you don&#146;t see 
that Haruka needs so much more than your beauty look and your pleading 
eyes?

&#147;Believe me, the only reason why he didn&#146;t leave you already is that 
he feels guilty for you. Guess he thinks that it&#146;s his duty to be with 
you. Maybe you think it&#146;s love, but I know it better: It&#146;s sympathy. 
Nothing more than simple sympathy for a handicapped girl that will 
never be able to live a proper life of her own!&#148;

Go away!!!!!

Michiru took another deep breathe and shortly looked up. The two 
pupils started the second lap and Haruka was in the leading position. 
Surely she would win that race. As so many races before.

Hope Tsukasa leaves her in peace after that contest!

&#147;Hey, cripple! I am talking to you!&#148; Ayako stepped forward and grabbed 
the sketchbook. Michiru rolled her eyes and reached for it but the red 
haired girl was faster. Of course she was faster. She stepped back and 
looked at the running Haruka on the paper.

She&#146;s talented.

Ayako swallowed hard and automatically shook her head.

But she&#146;s still a bloody cripple. And she&#146;s the girlfriend of the boy 
who should be mine!

&#147;Give it back to me, please!&#148; Michiru said quietly and sighed. She 
decided that this was the last time she draw in the presence of other 
people than her Ruka. They all seemed to want destroy her pictures and 
she was tired of redrawing them again at home. And she was tired of 
Haruka&#146;s sad looks when another crumbled paper went into the dustbin.

&#147;Okay. If you want it...&#148; Ayako turned again towards her and threw the 
sketchbook in the air. Single sheets of paper flew softly to the 
ground and covered the earth around the wheelchair. It was almost 
impossible for Michiru to collect them without driving over them with 
her heavy wheelchair. And Ayako knew it as well. &#147;... then catch 
them!&#148; she shouted and laughed a rude laugh. The red haired girl 
wanted to leave as her eyes caught one picture Michiru was reaching 
for. It laid directly before the wheelchair and moved slightly in the 
warm spring wind. It showed a sleeping Haruka. Her short hairs were 
messed and a soft expression laid on her relaxed face Ayako had never 
seen before. The blanket covered her body but the shoulders and the 
right leg let suppose that  she didn&#146;t wear a pyjama.

&#147;You bitch!&#148; whispered Ayako and jealousy sparkled in her light eyes 
as she leaned forward and slapped Michiru right in her face. The 
handicapped girl didn&#146;t even wince away. She just sat there and 
watched her with those deep blue eyes that made her mad.

&#147;I can&#146;t believe it!&#148; Ayako took a deep breathe, her fists were still 
clenched. &#147;What do you have? What is it, you cripple? You can&#146;t walk 
with him, you can&#146;t run with him! Certainly you&#146;re a burden for him. 
He must take care where ever you are. You can&#146;t live your whole life 
in Mugen Gakkuen and what after you finished your school? Maybe you&#146;re 
talented, but you won&#146;t find a proper job out there. They don&#146;t wanna 
cripples! They wanna young, attractive, dynamic young people. Guess 
you can&#146;t even go to toilette alone!&#148; Ayako&#146;s voice increased but it 
wasn&#146;t heard. The shouting of the other pupils were louder.

&#147;What is it that he wants from you, bloody cripple? Is he so keen on 
washing you? Feeding you? Driving you with his big car around to the 
doctor&#146;s appointment? Guess the doctor only wants to see you because 
you brings him money. There&#146;s no cure for you cripple, but you pay 
good for the hopes he gives you. I am right, hai?&#148;

Michiru lowered her head and covered her ears with her trembling 
hands.

&#147;Be silent!&#148; she said and her shaky voice broke. Tears burned in her 
eyes as she heard the rude words. The true words...

&#147;What the hell gets him into your bed that you can draw such 
pictures?&#148; Ayako didn&#146;t want to be silent. She was jealous and 
suddenly very hurt. She had to shout at the handicapped girl. 
Otherwise she would beat her down. &#147;What the hell does he sees in you, 
you bloody cripple?! Guess you&#146;re even unable to make proper love. 
With that dead body you&#146;re surely a lousy lover. And what about 
children? Doesn&#146;t he want to have some one day? Don&#146;t tell me that you 
think you&#146;re able to get one with that wreck of a body, you cripple!&#148; 
Ayako still clenched her fists and stepped nearer. &#147;Don&#146;t you think 
it&#146;s unfair to betray Haruka in that way? To abuse his sympathy for 
you?!&#148;

That was the moment when Michiru defended herself for the first time 
Ayako knew her. Well, she often defended Hotaru or some other girl she 
knew against her club, but what happened to her seemed to be alike to 
her. Up to now. The young violinist reached for the now empty 
sketchbook and threw it with all her powers at the red haired girl. 
Some pens and a ruler followed.

Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up!

Ayako winced surprised because the flying objects hitting her body 
hurt.

She&#146;s strong!

&#147;Why can&#146;t you accept the truth, you bloody cripple? You belong in a 
hospital for all times and he belongs to normal people &#150; like me!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t you dare to talk about things you don&#146;t know. You don&#146;t 
understand!&#148; answered Michiru and reached for her lunch in her bag. 
She didn&#146;t eat it because she wasn&#146;t hungry. It was an apple and an 
orange. Now she threw the fruits at the red haired girl. Tears 
sparkled in her deep blue eyes but she simply couldn&#146;t cry.

Ayako evaded them and grabbed Michiru&#146;s arm. With one pull the 
handicapped girl laid in the dirt. Too weak to defend herself. Too 
helpless to get back into the wheelchair again.

&#147;Comprehend finally! You&#146;re a bloody cripple!&#148; snapped Ayako and tried 
to ignore the empty look that seemed to perforate her.

Haruka closed her eyes while she run. She felt the wind playing with 
her clothes, heard the rushes of the near see. She recognized that old 
feeling she almost forgotten. She lost almost half a year ago when she 
left her father for good. At those times she ran as fast as she could. 
She raced the Suzuki as far as she could &#150; just to escape her father. 
To escape her dark life. To escape her hopeless future.

And now, what are you escaping from this time?

Haruka didn&#146;t know. She didn&#146;t hear the screams around her. Of course 
she got the leading position although Tsukasa was very fast himself. 
When she would win she would gratulate him that he was such a good 
opponent. He was very good in his sports and she didn&#146;t want to hurt 
him. He asked of this contest and now he would get it. But she didn&#146;t 
want to take his pride.

We would be good partners in a relay race in the summer&#146;s 
competitions.

They reached the second lap and the shouting increased. Just two more 
minutes and the contest would be over. And hopefully the terror of 
Tsukasa, too. Haruka never ever wanted him seeing threaten her 
Michi-chan again. She didn&#146;t know what she would do the next time.

Haruka opened her eyes for the last meters. There were only one or two 
hundred meters to the finish line and although Tsukasa fought hard he 
was behind her. Only one shadow length but it was enough for her to 
win.

At that moment she saw the motion at the rim of the arena. Michiru was 
there in the shadows of a huge tree. Haruka frowned and got slower as 
she recognized that her girlfriend wasn&#146;t alone there. Then she saw 
how the young violinist fell out of the wheelchair.

Haruka didn&#146;t care about Tsukasa who overtook her easily. She didn&#146;t 
hear the shouting of the pupils as the tall boy crossed the finish 
line as winner. She didn&#146;t care about the disappointed and suddenly 
very surprised looks as she simply left the sandy underground and 
walked determined over to the huge tree. The race had never been very 
important to her. Okay, Tsukasa won now. It didn&#146;t matter to her. If 
he left her in peace now, it was okay. All that mattered to her was 
Michiru who laid in the dirt and supported her weak body with her 
elbows. Pictures laid around her in the grass and an angry looking 
Ayako stood over her.

Haruka simply pushed the red haired girl aside as she went on her 
knees next to her girlfriend. She looked into tear filled blue eyes 
and sighed slightly. She looked down at the picture Michiru held tight 
in her trembling hands and smiled a bit as she saw her sleeping I.

&#147;And you told me you weren&#146;t awake for so long.&#148; Declared the young 
racer and stroke some strands of sea green hairs out of a very pale 
face.

&#147;Hai...&#148; whispered Michiru with a shaky voice and swallowed hard. 
Haruka could see how she fought against her own tears. Tears she 
didn&#146;t cry since the terrible accident that took her her parents and a 
lot of dreams away. Probably forever...

&#147;Everything okay?&#148; Haruka looked concerned at her girlfriend who 
laughed a sad laugh.

&#147;Of course, Ruka. Everything is okay!&#148; snapped Michiru back and wiped 
away some tears she couldn&#146;t hold back any longer with a quick motion 
as if she was ashamed of them. &#147;I am trapped in this damn wheelchair 
for the rest of my life! My doctor says that I&#146;ll never be able to 
walk again. I&#146;ll never be able to swim again or to ride. I won so many 
prices with my swimming and I was really fast. Now I almost drown in 
this bloody tube! I will never be able to run with you along the 
beach! I will never drive with you on your Suzuki again and I don&#146;t 
dream of a normal life anymore. I am paralysed, Ruka! My legs won&#146;t 
hold my no more and who wants to listen to a handicapped musician, 
after all?&#148; Michiru&#146;s voice was shaky again and she took a deep 
breathe. &#147;I am a bloody cripple for the rest of my life. I need help 
for the rest of my life. Hell, I can&#146;t even dress properly! I am so 
fed up to stood in front of the supermarket and can&#146;t go in because 
there&#146;re steps at the front door. I&#146;ll never be able to live in my 
parents beach house, because there&#146;s a big staircase and it&#146;s twenty 
miles away from Tokyo! And even if there was a bus I would never get 
into it with that bloody wheelchair!&#148; Michiru raised one hand and hit 
the metal hard. It hurt a lot but she didn&#146;t even mention it. &#147;My 
parents would be ashamed of me to see me like this! It would have been 
better if I&#146;d have died with them.&#148; Suddenly Michiru&#146;s voice was very 
silent and she couldn&#146;t held back a desperate sob.

&#147;Don&#146;t say such silly words, Michi-chan.&#148; Whispered Haruka and sighed 
sadly.

&#147;Why not? It&#146;s true! It would be better for me being dead! After all 
who wants a bloody cripple?&#148; Some tears were running down her cheeks 
but she raised her now hurting hand again to wipe them quickly away.

&#147;Michi-chan, you know, I would never...&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t need your sympathy!&#148; It was a desperate scream before Michiru 
covered her burning face with her icy hands and started desperately to 
sob. Haruka just took her into her strong arms and hold her tight as 
she wanted to escape. The young racer pulled her girlfriend closer and 
rocked her gently. Michiru&#146;s body trembled like leaves in the cold 
autumn wind but she gave up her fight and leaned herself against 
Haruka&#146;s warm chest.

&#147;You know it&#146;s so much more than sympathy.&#148; Whispered Haruka near her 
ear and swallowed hard. She could feel how she blushed but she knew 
that Michiru needed her words more than her hidden gestures. &#147;You know 
it&#146;s even more than simple love, Michi-chan.&#148;

Those words broke the invisible wall. Michiru wrapped her arms around 
Haruka&#146;s neck, hide her burning face in her girlfriend&#146;s shoulder and 
let all the tears fall she fought back the last months. She felt how 
Haruka&#146;s embracement became stronger and didn&#146;t oppress her desperate 
sobs anymore.

&quot;I thought I could begin a new life here. Without any memories of my 
talents I used to have. Without thinking of how great it was to play 
the violin before so many people. How great it was to win the swimming 
competitions. Hey, they wanted me to take for the Olympic Games!&quot; 
cried Michiru against her shoulder and Haruka wondered how she could 
have been so blind. She saw a smiling, a laughing Michiru and didn&#39;t 
see the wrecked girl behind that facade. She only saw a Michiru who 
didn&#39;t argue with Ayako, who defended Hotaru and cared a lot for 
Haruka. Who never really complaint about her situation. Who just went 
on with her life and didn&#39;t give up. Who learned how to handle the 
wheelchair, who had very good marks at school and started drawing 
again.

&quot;I thought this was a place where I don&#39;t see my parents in each 
corner. But I&#39;ve been wrong.&quot; Michiru pulled herself nearer and  
coughed. Haruka held her tighter. How could she be so naive? After 
Christmas and after the exiting snowball battle she had almost thought 
that Michiru was over her mourning. That she had accepted her destiny 
and faced encouraged her future. But Haruka had been wrong. Now she 
saw that the young violinist needed more time than a short half year.

I was so happy to be with her that I didn&#39;t see the signs.

&quot;No one wants me here. They all hate me.&quot; Cried Michiru with a shaky 
voice that broke. Haruka sighed deeply and started to stroke the sea 
green hairs tenderly.

&quot;I love you.&quot; Whispered the young racer next to her girlfriend&#39;s ear 
and blushed even more. Michiru raised her head and Haruka saw into 
tear filled, deep blue eyes. They lived together since they moved into 
Mugen Gakkuen. Two years ago it was so naturally that they belonged to 
another even if Haruka&#39;s father disagreed. They shared their free 
time. Their angers and sorrows. But also their joys. They kissed more 
than once and sometimes they went out like a loving couple. But Haruka 
did never say those special words. She simply thought that Michiru 
knew her feelings. And she had never been so good in words. Only in 
situations she knew that words were more needed than her hidden 
gestures.

Haruka raised her hands and took her girlfriend&#39;s hot face into them. 
Seriously she looked down at Michiru and wiped away the tears. They 
were replaced by new ones.

&quot;Remember what I told you in the hospital, Michi-chan? I promised you 
that I&#39;d never leave you. I meant it honestly.&quot; Haruka leaned forward 
and gave her a quick kiss. &quot;If you don&#39;t want to stay here, it&#39;s okay. 
We can leave Mugen Gakkuen  and go somewhere else in Japan or the 
world.&quot;

&quot;With your English knowledge?&quot; asked Michiru and Haruka was relieved 
when she saw a tiny smile on her girlfriend&#39;s pale face. She didn&#39;t 
like to see her Michi-chan so sad. So desperate. Then the young 
violinist shook her head and the smile disappeared. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t make 
any difference. All people are the same. They would only see the 
cripple outside...&quot;

&quot;Not all people are, Michi-chan.&quot; Answered Haruka very quietly and 
thought at the young girls chasing themselves in the snow. Arguing 
friendly with another. Involving Michiru in their game as if she had 
always been part of their community. 

Michiru leaned her head again against Haruka&#39;s shoulder. Silently she 
cried again. And the young racer held her again tight and tried to 
comfort her the best she could.

They both didn&#39;t mention the pupils who stood very quietly around and 
stared shocked at the couple down in the dirt. Who looked asking at 
each other.

Who looked very guilty with a sudden.

***

&quot;Arigato.&quot; Haruka took the bowls from the delivering man and gave him 
the money. Then she balanced their dinner in the kitchen. Michiru 
wasn&#39;t in the mood of cooking and the young racer didn&#39;t want to 
poison them. So they decided to order something from the Italian 
restaurant they had been some times since Christmas.

I decided for ordering.

Haruka sighed as she put the bowls down on the round table. They 
contained salad and spaghetti. 

Hope she wants to eat at least anything of it. 

The young racer ran a trembling hand through her short blonde hair and 
went over to her girlfriend&#39;s bedroom. When they came home the young 
violinist went into her room and didn&#39;t get out. Haruka let Michiru 
her peace but two hours were enough now. Haruka started to get worried 
and she didn&#39;t want to spend the evening on her own. Alone.

&quot;Michi-chan?&quot; Silently she opened the door and entered the room. The 
smaller girl laid on her bed. Sad music filled the air from the 
headphone. Michiru&#39;s eyes were closed and from the regular breathing 
recognized Haruka that her girlfriend actually fell asleep.

How many nights didn&#39;t she sleep properly? Or didn&#39;t she sleep at all?

Haruka sat down on the bed next to her girlfriend and took her right 
hand into her own ones and held it tight. Then she leaned against the 
wall with a sigh and froze in motion. She frowned and her dark green 
eyes stared confused on the huge easel she gave her Michi-chan on 
Christmas. The whole easel was full with colours and it smelled very 
intensive of oil colours.

When did she finish it?

She could remember Michiru starting it two months ago. The young 
violinist threw a brush after her when she wanted to look at it. 
Michiru declared determined that no one would see it until it was 
ready.

Now I know why. Because it&#39;s very personal.

The main colours were a light green and a dark blue. And black. It 
showed an ocean. Deep under the surface swam a young girl of maybe 
five years. Happily she laughed at the observer outside the picture. 
Her blue eyes shone full of luck and joy. The tiny hands reached out 
for coloured fishes that surrounded her in her blue heaven. Sea green 
hairs surrounded a redden face and the girl looked like Neptune&#39;s 
daughter. Neptune, the god of the sea and emperor of all waters.

Like a mermaid.

Haruka swallowed hard as she saw the black lines that followed the 
happy child. Dark and threatening. Slowly they filled the blue sea 
from behind and soon they would do the little mermaid harm. The black 
lines reached the surface. Over the water there was no light. No sun. 
No heaven. There was only a shadow at the shore. Standing silently 
there. Motionless.

Haruka&#39;s eyes grew wide as she recognized that the shadow was a girl 
sitting in a wheelchair. No face was recognisable because she had 
covered it with her hands. As if she wasn&#39;t able any more to watch the 
happy girl she once had been.

She never would be again.

***

&quot;What are we doing here?&quot; Michiru yawned and rubbed her eyes. She 
awoke half an hour ago and after she ate a little bit of her spaghetti 
Haruka bought her to the swimming pool of Mugen Gakkuen. With tired 
blue eyes stared the young violinist in the water. The half moon 
reflected on the calm surface and steam rose in the cold night air. 
Although it had been a very nice and warm spring day, it soon got 
colder when the sun disappeared.

&quot;It&#39;s in the middle of the night!&quot;

Haruka kneeled before the swimming pool and tested the water 
temperature. She only wore her black shorts and a white t-shirt. 
Satisfied with the water being warm she came to her feet and over to 
her girlfriend.

&quot;We&#39;re going to take a bath.&quot; She declared and took Michiru&#39;s hands 
before she could grab the wheels. The young violinist looked up to her 
with big blue eyes. Slightly she shook her head and swallowed hard.

&quot;I won&#39;t go into the water.&quot; Said Michiru and shook her head again. &quot;I 
am too young to drown.&quot; She wanted to escape but she knew she would 
loose against her Haruka. She knew she would even if she wasn&#39;t 
trapped in this bloody wheelchair. Haruka had always been faster. And 
when the young racer was determined no one could stop her.

&quot;But I don&#39;t have a swim suit.&quot; It was a last, weak try to convince 
her girlfriend but Haruka didn&#39;t listen.

&quot;Your dress is a perfect swim suit.&quot; Before Michiru could protest 
anymore Haruka hold her in her strong arms and went over to the 
swimming pool. Michiru wrapped her arms around her neck and stared 
frightened at the water that wasn&#39;t so deep but for her paralysed legs 
it was deeper than the deepest ocean. The young violinist gasped for 
breathe as she felt the warm water around her as they both entered the 
swimming pool. Haruka held her tight and kissed her on the suddenly 
pale cheeks.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, Michi-chan. I am here. I won&#39;t let you drown.&quot; 
Whispered the young racer and took another step until they were 
surrounded by water up to their chests. Michiru&#39;s embracement got 
stronger and suddenly her whole body trembled although the water was 
very warm.

&quot;You loved the water. We got to know each other by the sea at your 
parent&#39;s house.&quot; Haruka turned Michiru around until she could see into 
those big, frightened eyes. &quot;Can&#39;t you remember how I tried to chase 
you in the ocean and you was simply faster? The water&#39;s your element, 
Michi-chan. It belongs to you how you belong to it. Here you could 
even beat me and you know how shocked I was that you, that someone on 
this earth could be faster than I.&quot; Haruka smiled tender in the pale 
face. &quot;Down in the water you always looked like another person Like 
mermaid. You didn&#39;t win all those competition just because you trained 
every day. You simply won them because you&#39;re part of the sea, 
Michi-chan. I can see it in your eyes when you look out of the window 
and watch the waves. And even if you don&#39;t believe me now, you&#39;re 
still part of it. Even after all what happened during the last half 
year.&quot;

Michiru smiled back and took a deep breathe. She saw how her 
girlfriend blushed. As always when she said more than some single 
words. As always when her Ruka tried to comfort her. To tell her 
feelings to her.

Very slowly the young violinist let go of Haruka&#39;s neck and her hands 
and later her arms dove into the pleasant warm water. She felt how the 
young racer tightened her embracement.

She won&#39;t ever leave my side.

Michiru took another deep breathe and felt the water playing with her 
body as she moved slightly.

Maybe she&#39;s right.

The young violinist closed her eyes and for the first time after the 
accident she heard the music again in her head. The music the water 
and waves made. Like tender whispers the sea&#39;s voices surrounded her. 
A bird screamed high above and she smelled the salt in the air again. 
It had always been there during the past months but she didn&#39;t care 
about it.

A smile appeared on her pale face and some tears sparkled behind her 
lashes.

I didn&#39;t realize how much I missed it.

Here she had been at home for so many times. Every time she felt 
lonely when her parents were far away with their business company or 
her father was on tour and she couldn&#39;t come with them because of her 
school. The waves comforted her after Haruka&#39;s father came and took 
the screaming girl with him. Shouting. Beating. Hating...

Under the water it was so quiet. So peaceful. Here she heard the music 
she wrote afterwards for her violin. It was her father&#39;s will to learn 
an instrument. But it was her will to learn it so well. Because every 
time she could play she was again in her under water world.

How could I forget this?

Michiru opened her eyes again and the music increased. She looked into 
a smiling face of Haruka and automatically raised her wet hand and 
stroke the wild strands of the short blonde hair.

&quot;Arigato, Ruka.&quot; She whispered and kissed her girlfriend tenderly. 
Haruka held her tight and returned the kiss with all her love. Michiru 
giggled at her lips as the taller girl didn&#39;t want to let this touch 
end.

&quot;We should do this more often.&quot; Declared the young violinist and 
suddenly a new music evolved in her head. It was the first time since 
the accident that she heard the music again and it made her happy. She 
thought she had lost it with her leg&#39;s powers, too. But the truth was 
that she hide it behind her self pity. Over half a year of mourning 
was enough. 

I am still alive!

Michiru looked into dreamy green eyes and gave her girlfriend another 
kiss.

And I am loved!

&quot;What? Taking a bath or kissing?&quot; asked Haruka after a while teasing 
and shivered as fresh wind played with her now wet hairs.

&quot;Both!&quot; answered Michiru laughing. She looked into the water and saw 
the reflection of them both on the surface. The picture shook. Michiru 
laid her head against Haruka&#39;s now wet shoulder and stroke over the 
calm water. She liked what she saw in the water&#39;s mirror.

We&#39;re a nice couple.

She embraced her girlfriend tighter and enjoyed the standing position. 
Here in the water her legs were still paralysed but the water carried 
her. Here she wouldn&#39;t break down or laying helpless on the ground. 
Here she was strong again and no one could see that she was 
handicapped.

Here I am not a cripple anymore!

&quot;I love you.&quot; She whispered and looked again up into the now dark red 
face of her Haruka. The racer only nodded and kissed her tenderly. 
Michiru smiled and returned the sweet touch.

&quot;Hey, you two! It&#39;s forbidden to swim at night!&quot; shouted an angry 
voice suddenly near the rim. They both separated partly and looked 
surprised at an angry Ayako. &quot;Dr. Tomoe would be very disappointed if 
his best athlete would have drown.&quot; Ayako clenched her fists and tried 
to hide her jealousy behind her rough voice. She didn&#39;t like to see 
that cripple kissing the boy who was meant to be hers. &quot;Get out of the 
water. Now! And go back to your rooms before I have to report this 
incident to Miss Kaori!&quot;

Haruka sighed but she knew that it was enough for now as she looked 
into tired blue eyes. And she knew that she achieved what she wanted 
as Michiru smiled happily. The young racer took her girlfriend into 
her strong arms and carried her out of the water back into the 
wheelchair. She covered Michiru&#39;s wet body with a huge towel she 
brought with her and looked around for her own one.

Ayako gasped for breathe as she saw the unambiguous female outlines of 
the fast athlete. The wet t-shirt pasted to her slim body and Ayako 
could see the breasts under the white cloth.

&quot;You&#39;re a girl?&quot; asked the red haired girl and her voice sounded high 
and strange in her own ears. Haruka didn&#39;t look up as she reached for 
her own towel.

&quot;I never said I am a boy.&quot; She declared and covered her own body with 
her towel. She shivered slightly. It was really very cold outside the 
warm water. Better they got back into their apartment before they both 
could get a cold.

&quot;Then you&#39;re... you&#39;re...&quot; stammered Ayako and shook her head as all 
her dreams died away like a bubble stung by a needle. &quot;You&#39;re...&quot;

&quot;What? Pervert?&quot; asked Haruka with a dangerous quiet voice and stepped 
behind the wheelchair. Slowly she took it&#39;s handlebars into the 
suddenly trembling hands and wanted to turn away. &quot;Or simply in love?&#148;

Michiru just watched her girlfriend and frowned. She knew that Haruka 
had always been slim. She trained a lot and didn&#39;t like sweets. But 
today Michiru had seen her  ribs under the wet t-shirt for the first 
time. Did she loose weight during the last weeks?

Michiru couldn&#39;t remember how much the young racer ate. She had been 
to occupied with her self pity that she didn&#39;t take care of it.

Hai, Ruka was always slime. But today she looks skinny. Almost 
starved...

&quot;You&#39;re bloody lesbians!&quot; screamed Ayako and Michiru wondered why she 
didn&#39;t wake up other pupils. But the windows stayed shut. No light 
went on. &quot;You&#39;re so ill!!!&quot;

The young violinist simply shook her head and covered her legs with 
her towel. She froze and suddenly she was very tired.

&quot;Maybe I am a cripple but I am not handicapped in my brain.&quot; She 
declared silently. Then Haruka turned the wheelchair around and they 
both returned into the living-tower. Leaving a raging Ayako behind.

***

The next day at school wasn&#39;t very eventful. Ayako didn&#39;t came to the 
lessons and some said that she had a very bad cold and had to stay at 
bed. Rumiko told them some jokes and pleaded Michiru for helping her 
with her picture about a rose. It still didn&#39;t look very realistic and 
she wanted to gave it to her mother on her birthday. Rumiko and some 
other girls talked to them. The rest of the pupils seemed to evade 
them. They looked at them curiously but they actually didn&#39;t dare to 
talk to them.

&quot;I am home.&quot; Shouted Michiru as she entered their apartment. Her 
drawing lesson was over now and Rumiko had to do something in the 
city. But later she wanted to come together with some other girls for 
dinner. They all wanted to watch a movie on TV and Michiru wanted to 
make dinner.

Ruka&#39;s right. Not all people are as mean as Ayako.

&quot;Ruka?&quot; Michiru laid her sketchbook down on the table and opened the 
fridge. She decided for chicken and chips. Every girl liked the meal 
and it wasn&#39;t very hard to get it ready.

&quot;Ruka?&quot; The young violinist rolled over to the living-room. The TV was 
on and some musician danced over the screen but there was no sign of 
the young racer. Then Michiru heard the sound of water. Obviously 
Haruka was taking a shower.

Hope it doesn&#39;t last so long.

Michiru took the remote control and switched off the TV set. She 
needed someone who took the chairs of the kitchen into the living-room 
so that they all would have enough place around the TV set. The young 
violinist waited patiently for another fifteen minutes. Then she 
rolled over to the bathroom. The door wasn&#39;t closed and Michiru could 
hear that the shower still worked. As she wanted to enter the room she 
could see Haruka. Her hairs were wet and the towel laid next to her on 
the ground. Her dark green eyes stared empty on her reflection in the 
huge mirror. She was naked and Michiru gasped as she saw the bones 
under the pale skin. The girl looked more like a skeleton than a 
living human.

Haruka didn&#39;t see the young violinist. Slowly the young racer raised 
her hands and touched her small but well formed breasts. Tears burned 
in her normally dry eyes.

&quot;It&#39;s alike what I do, they&#39;re still growing.&quot; Whispered Haruka in a 
desperate voice. Then she went back into the shower, closed the door 
and the waterfall increased.

Michiru covered her mouth with her hand while she silently rolled back 
into the kitchen. Shocked she stared at the chicken and automatically 
prepared their dinner. But her thoughts were still at the skinny 
appearance of her girlfriend while she heated the cooker and set the 
table.

Slowly Michiru recognized that she wasn&#39;t the only one who had 
problems with her body and her destiny.

Big problems.
