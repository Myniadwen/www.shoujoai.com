<h1>Slowly Dawning (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/slowdawn-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Rei-chan - do you have any plans today?&quot; Minako asked as they met on 
the street and headed towards Hikawa Shrine.

&quot;I have a test tomorrow that I need to study for, but it&#39;s in history, 
so I should do fine. Why?&quot;

Minako shrugged. She wasn&#146;t sure why, except she wanted to spend more 
time with Rei. Alone. &quot;I was just thinking that we hardly ever get to 
spend time together.&quot;

&quot;Minako,&quot; Rei commented, &quot;we&#146;re together almost every afternoon. 
You&#146;re over my house nearly every day!&quot;

&quot;You know what I mean!&quot; Minako&#146;s eyes flashed at Rei.

Rei found her breath caught in her chest. She looked again at Minako 
and smiled. &quot;Well, what do you want to do, then?&quot;

Minako turned her eyes away and muttered, &quot;Lay you down on a futon 
and...&quot;

&quot;What did you say?&quot; Rei demanded.

Minako had no idea where that had come from. She blushed and waved her 
hand dismissively. &quot;Oh, just commenting on the weather - we have a 
cold front coming on.&quot; 

They walked in silence, each wondering what they other was thinking.

Minako had a very low tension tolerance. She broke first. &quot;What are 
you thinking?&quot;

&quot;What are *you* thinking?&quot; Rei shot back.

&quot;I&#146;m thinking that Crystal Tokyo is a long time away. It&#39;s a long time 
and who&#146;s going to be with us along the way?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; This was *not* what Rei had expected.

&quot;I mean,&quot; Minako turned to Rei. &quot;Who else but us, I mean all of us, 
are going to be around, that we know, a thousand years from now?&quot; 

Rei stopped, then looked off into the distance. &quot;I hadn&#146;t ever thought 
about that.&quot;

&quot;I hadn&#146;t either, until now.&quot; Minako took Rei&#146;s hand. &quot;You&#146;ve probably 
been told this before, but you are very beautiful, Hino Rei.&quot; 

Rei reeled at the non sequitor, then reddened, but said nothing. They 
walked, holding hands for a while, then Minako let go of Rei. They 
came to the steps of the Shrine and Minako sat down on the bottom 
step, laying her bookbag on her lap.

Rei sat next to her and the two women stared ahead for a while.

Minako sighed. &quot;You&#146;re going to make me work at this, aren&#146;t you?&quot; and 
she turned to look into Rei&#146;s eyes.

&quot;I don&#146;t know what you me....&quot; Rei was cut off as Minako leaned 
forward and kissed her. Rei&#146;s eyes widened, then closed.

Minako&#146;s voice was quiet when they broke apart. &quot;I mean, Rei-chan, 
that we will become very lonely if we fall in love with some regular 
guy and then watch him die. And then do it again, and again. And who 
else do we have that we can be ourselves with, but each other?&quot;

Rei stood and held out a hand to Minako, then helped her up from the 
stairs. They walked up the steps and entered the Shrine precincts. Rei 
slid open the door and let Minako in first. She closed the door behind 
her and watched Minako walk ahead of her. Long legs, athletic body, 
she could do worse, indeed.

&quot;Have you ever wondered the kind of person you&#146;ll fall in love will be 
like?&quot; Rei asked Minako, then laughed, as she realized just *who* she 
had asked. &quot;Of course you have...&quot;

Rei stepped up behind Minako and put her arms around the blonde. &quot;I 
wonder how many times a person can fall in love?&quot; Minako breathed, 
then leaned back into Rei&#146;s body.

&quot;In a thousand years?&quot; Rei asked, close to Minako&#146;s ear.

&quot;In seventeen.&quot; Minako laughed, then caught her breath as Rei placed 
several soft kisses on her neck.

Rei leaned into the junction between Minako&#146;s neck and shoulder. 
Minako pulled away and turned to face Rei. Her hair hung, dark and 
thick across her shoulders and Minako pulled it away from Rei&#146;s face. 
She leaned forward and kissed Rei again, holding herself against Rei, 
until she could feel Rei&#146;s arms pull her in.

They sat on the edge of the bed and Minako found herself staring into 
dark eyes, which looked at her with a certain amusement.

&quot;What?&quot; Minako asked, stroking her hand along Rei&#146;s neck, finding the 
pulse, watching as Rei&#146;s mouth moved.

&quot;You seemed so intense the other day. And now you seem intense again, 
but in a different way. What are you thinking about?&quot;

Minako smiled at Rei. &quot;I was upset about the fact that I might never 
find anyone to love. But now I realize,&quot; Minako ran a hand across 
Rei&#146;s lips, &quot;That it doesn&#146;t matter, because I&#146;ll always have you and 
the others to love.&quot; Rei nodded and pulled Minako in close. The two 
women embraced, reveling in the warmth and softness of the other.

&quot;A thousand years is a very long time, isn&#146;t it?&quot; Minako breathed into 
Rei&#146;s ear.

&quot;Time enough for more than one love.&quot; Rei agreed. She shivered as 
Minako untied the tie from around her neck, and began to unfasten the 
buttons beneath it. Minako shoved gently, until Rei fell backwards 
onto the bed. Minako laid herself on top of the other girl and looked 
down at her, grinning.

&quot;Now what?&quot; Rei asked, as Minako gazed down at her, answering the 
smile she saw with one of her own.

&quot;I was just remembering the day that I came with you to your school.&quot; 
Minako giggled.

Rei groaned. &quot;Don&#146;t remind me - it took days, maybe weeks before the 
other girls stopped teasing me about you.&quot;

&quot;Was I really that bad?&quot; Minako pouted adorably.

Rei thought for a moment. &quot;No, not really. I hadn&#146;t realized just how 
stuffy we all were, how formal and stuck up.&quot; She met Minako&#146;s eyes. 
&quot;You were like a breath of fresh air in the school.&quot;

Minako leaned closer and Rei pulled her face down to meet her own. 
This kiss was long and sweet. Neither girl moved for the longest time. 
Rei ran her fingers through Minako&#146;s hair and pulled it closer to her 
face, inhaling the scent of fresh air and shampoo. 

&quot;You even smell like fresh air.&quot;

&quot;And you smell like incense.&quot; Minako moved her lips close to Rei&#146;s ear 
and whispered the words into it. She brushed the ear lightly with her 
lips, and felt Rei shiver in reaction. Minako let her tongue trail 
lightly down along the earlobe, circling Rei&#146;s earring. Rei moaned as 
Minako drew her tongue lightly into the lowest corner of Rei&#146;s ear. 
Minako giggled at Rei&#146;s reaction and the dark eyes that turned on her 
mournfully.

&quot;Laughing at me already?&quot;

&quot;Laughing because I feel good.&quot; Minako kissed Rei on the nose. &quot;You 
make me feel good.&quot;

Rei&#146;s eyes softened as she looked at the blonde woman now laying by 
her side. &quot;Really? Do you mean it?&quot; Minako nodded and Rei continued. 
&quot;Do you know - no one has ever said that to me before?&quot; 

Minako stroked Rei&#146;s cheek and gazed at her friend. &quot;I mean it 
Rei-chan.&quot; She pulled close to Rei and pressed her lips against Rei&#146;s. 
Her lips parted slightly in a smile, then her tongue traced the corner 
of Rei&#146;s mouth. Rei opened her mouth and their tongues touched gently, 
teasing each other. 

Minako felt a floodgate open up within her. Her spine was electrified 
with the touch of Rei against her. Her fingers felt as if they were on 
fire. She finished unbuttoning the vest Rei wore and helped her out of 
it. 

Rei slapped her hands away, and pushed Minako back against the bed. 
She leaned into Minako&#146;s neck once again, nipping at it, then gently, 
almost tenderly, biting Minako&#146;s windpipe. Minako let herself melt 
into the feeling, as Rei possessed her. She couldn&#146;t have said how 
they got from there to a state of complete nakedness, whether the 
clothes melted away or were taken off layer by layer, but now, now 
they lay next to each other, touching, caressing and kissing. Minako 
laid her head against Rei&#146;s chest, stroking the soft skin with her 
face and hair. 

Rei laughed. &quot;You&#146;ll get your hair all tangled up if you do that.&quot; 
Minako said nothing, but closed her eyes and felt the skin beneath 
her. &quot;I guess I&#146;ll just have to brush it out for you.&quot; 

Minako stopped and smiled. &quot;What a nice idea. Can I brush yours?&quot; Rei 
agreed and Minako allowed her eyes to close again. She turned her head 
so it lay against one breast, the other in front of her. She put a 
hand out tentatively to it, gently brought it to her mouth. Rei 
stiffened as Minako&#146;s mouth met her nipple. She could feel herself 
reach for Minako and draw her closer. Minako responded by placing one 
hand on Rei&#146;s hip, the other holding her breast, stroking the soft 
skin. She licked gently at Rei&#146;s nipple, then pulled her in and sucked 
at her hard. Rei&#146;s body bucked, then relaxed. Minako opened her eyes 
and watched Rei&#146;s face as she repeated this maneuver again, and again. 

Rei was magnificent, Minako thought as she felt the leg beneath her 
hand, then ran her hand along the tight buttock. Minako continued to 
minister to Rei&#146;s nipple, while feeling along Rei&#146;s hip, legs and ass. 
She began to squeeze Rei, who thrust herself closer and close to 
Minako, rubbing herself against the blonde. 

Minako laughed at this. She sat up and laid Rei flat on the bed, 
straddling her. Rei moaned furiously, as she felt Minako rub herself 
against her, shifting back and forth. The sensation of Minako&#146;s soft 
pussy grinding into her, leaving a trail of wetness, made Rei see red. 
Minako reached down and took Rei&#146;s hands and brought them to her 
breasts. Both women were moaning now, lost in the sensation of 
nerve-endings and desire.

&quot;Wait. Please.&quot; Rei gasped, as Minako reached down to touch her. 
Minako looked into Rei&#146;s eyes and waited, as Rei squirmed a bit, 
reaching for a drawer at the side of the bed. Minako&#146;s eyes widened a 
bit as Rei pulled out a not particularly realistic vibrator. Minako 
took it and looked at the happy face on it. She looked at Rei with a 
lopsided grin.

&quot;What can I say? It&#39;s a happy vibrator...&quot; Rei&#146;s voice jumped an 
octave as Minako switched the vibrator on and immediately placed it 
against Rei. All Rei could do was moan. Minako liked this a great 
deal. She moved the vibrator against Rei, then slowly, agonizingly 
slowly, placed it inside Rei, who now was lost in her own world of 
pleasure. Minako lowered her head to Rei&#146;s pussy, then softly, almost 
imperceptibly, began to kiss Rei. 

For a while there was no sound other than Rei&#146;s moans. Then Minako 
grinned, &quot;hmmed&quot; and swirled her tongue around Rei&#146;s clit. The 
dark-haired girl almost leapt off the bed at this.

&quot;Mina-chan..&quot; Rei grasped for Minako&#146;s hair. &quot;Beautiful...&quot; Rei pulled 
Minako in to her and Minako let her tongue caress Rei&#146;s clit. Slowly, 
slowly... she could feel Rei tensing beneath her. Pushing the vibrator 
deeper into Rei, Minako began to suck on her hard, until a nearly 
inaudible scream let her know that Rei was coming for her. Minako 
found herself moaning uncontrollably as Rei pounded the bed with her 
fists and bucked underneath her.

When Rei relaxed, Minako took one of Rei&#146;s hands and placed it between 
her own legs. Long, graceful fingers found her slit and began to play 
with the toy offered. Rei scraped one nail up Minako&#146;s slit, then 
dragged it across the most sensitive part of her. Minako felt herself 
squeal with the stimulation. Minako kneeled by Rei&#146;s head and Rei 
turned to face her.

&quot;Please, lick me.&quot; Minako breathed, and straddled herself over Rei&#146;s 
face. Rei did, and with a skill that left Minako wondering at her 
friend. Rei lapped up every ounce of wetness that Minako had, and then 
went searching for more. Minako had her head thrown back and reached 
down to help Rei. Rei let her tongue slide out of Minako, then draw up 
to where Minako&#146;s fingers played in her own wetness. Tongue and 
fingers slid across Minako&#146;s clit until she couldn&#146;t stand it any 
longer. Rei seemed to understand, and once again entered Minako. 
Minako&#146;s orgasm crashed through her, and she found herself pinching 
her own nipple, as Rei thrust deeply into her.

Minako laid down next to Rei and took her face in her hands. They 
kissed, long and tenderly, kissing each other&#146;s eyes and lips. Minako 
stared into Rei&#146;s dark eyes, which looked back at her, soft and warm.

&quot;You do make me feel good.&quot; Minako said.

&quot;And you make me feel good.&quot; Rei agreed. She rolled onto her back and 
Minako lifted herself on one arm to watch her. 

&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;I&#146;m thinking that a thousand years may not be long enough.&quot; Rei said 
and turned to Minako, smiling, filling Minako with warmth, like a 
slowly dawning sun over a cold planet.
