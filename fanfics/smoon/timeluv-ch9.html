<h1>No Time for Love (part 9 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/prince_kitten.html">Prince_Kitten</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/timeluv-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>	Luna almost smiled to herself as she watched Setsuna finish 
programming the communicators. With a lot of hard work, a bit of luck, 
and a ton of guess and check, the group had finally managed to figure 
out how to get the communicators to track wands. Just as she and her 
group had discovered that, the other team had run in announcing that 
they too had figured out how to use the communicators to track specific 
senshi signals. After that it hadn&#39;t even taken them that long to finish 
setting up. * Ami would be proud* She thought as she looked about the 
room. Books on ultrasonic waves and locators were strewn about and 
everyone was exhausted having studied most of the night and gotten up 
early that morning to start again. 
	&quot;There!&quot; Setsuna announced and everyone huddled in as she turned 
the small device over in her hand.
	&quot;Is that all?&quot; Mamoru asked and Setsuna nodded, still staring at 
the communicator.
	&quot;Well, here we go.&quot; She said and there was a collective held 
breath as she pressed the little buttons. She watched hard as the screen 
lit up and little lines flitted about the screen. It didn&#39;t take but a 
few moments for pings to start sounding and Setsuna stared at it a 
minute longer before leaning back. &quot;It&#39;s working.&quot; She announced and 
cheers resounded. Usagi glomped Mamoru and he hugged her back. Minako 
and Makoto breathed out happily and both settled back and Michiru and 
Haruka smiled at each other. Between them Hotaru bounced.
	&quot;How long will it take?&quot; She asked and Setsuna watched the little 
machine.
	&quot;From what I can tell, it shouldn&#39;t take too long. It just has to 
reach their wands and then we should know exactly where they are. Not 
more than an hour I would say.&quot; Everyone settled back into their 
respective chairs until Haruka got a silly grin on her face and regarded 
Makoto and Minako with a sly smile.
	&quot;So, &quot; She said curiously, drawing looks from around the room, 
&quot;has the problem of giving Rei-chan and Ami-chan a reason to come back 
been taken care of?&quot; Michiru thwacked her lover&#39;s side but everyone had 
already turned to watch Makoto and Minako as that was where Haruka had 
directed her question. If she had thought things had gone bad, she 
wouldn&#39;t of put them on the spot like that. But they had both been 
smiling so much yesterday that she just knew things were okay. Usagi 
nearly dropped her jaw in shock seeing the blushes on Minako and 
Makoto&#39;s faces. Granted Kira hadn&#39;t really left much doubt but to have 
it confirmed like this...
	&quot;You mean you guys are the ones that Ami-chan and Rei-chan love?&quot; 
She asked and Minako and Makoto both flushed darker. She watched them a 
bit longer but could clearly sense the happiness coming off her senshi. 
So, she indulged in harmless teasing too.  ?Soooo, &quot; She drawled out, 
&quot;are you two in looooove with them?&quot; She grinned watching them both duck 
their eyes. They looked over at each other but looked back up at their 
princess and both shyly nodded. Usagi squealed and Haurka laughed aloud, 
reaching over to lightly clap Makoto on the shoulder.
	&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; She exclaimed to the brunette.&quot;Now Michiru and I 
have people to double and triple date with.&quot; Michiru smacked her lightly 
again, but couldn&#39;t help the small smile she got on her face too. And 
though both Minako and Makoto were both flushing deeply they were 
smiling too. Setsuna looked over at Usagi to see what her reaction was 
and was surprised to see Usagi frowning.
	&quot;Usagi-chan?&quot; She asked and everyone looked up at her. Mamoru help 
her hand tightly and she blinked, shaking her head. 
	&quot;My, my head hurts a little.&quot; She said, still spacing. Setsuna 
felt a shiver go through her and turned to see her daughter staring into 
space as well.
	&quot;Hotaru-chan? Sweetie what is it?&quot; Michiru asked, kneeling beside 
her. Hotaru looked back down at Michiru slowly, then to the rest of the 
group.
	&quot;Someone is coming.&quot; She said quietly and everyone moved to pull 
out their wands but something pricked Setsuna&#39;s mind and she stood.
	&quot;No, don&#39;t. Go into the back room, now. All of you.&quot; She said 
urgently and everyone stood, unsure.
	&quot;But, Setsuna-chan...&quot; Usagi started and Setsuna looked at her 
seriously.
	&quot;Now Usagi-chan. Especially you. And don&#39;t come out, understand?&quot; 
She exchanged looks with Mamoru who looked to Michiru and Haruka. They 
both nodded and everyone left the room quickly, Usagi giving Setsuna 
backwards glance before the door shut. Setsuna wasn&#39;t sure what it was 
but she knew this feeling. * It&#39;s not Kira, but why does it feel so 
familiar?* She didn&#39;t bother transforming, only hid the communicator in 
her pocket as the presence grew closer. She watched the back door 
closely as it swung open and a figure strode confidently inside. As soon 
as she saw who it was she inhaled sharply, glad that she had sent the 
others from the room. The figure saw her as soon as he entered and his 
cold laugh chilled Setsuna.
	&quot;Well, well well. If it isn&#39;t the lost girl herself.&quot; Akio said  
and Setsuna reflexively took a step back. She&#39;d only met him once or 
twice but it was enough to know that he was bad news. &quot;You know, &quot; he 
said cooly, seating himself on the chair across from her and folding his 
hands on crossed knees, &quot;I didn&#39;t quite believe it when I heard you were 
a senshi. I thought maybe it was wishful thinking on Kira-chan&#39;s part. 
That she was seeing things or something. But she was so furious when she 
found out I was listening, so protective of her little friends, I just 
had to see for myself.&quot; Setsuna didn&#39;t sit down but in her head relaxed. 
* Kira didn&#39;t tell him about me or the others. She could have for 
revenge, but she didn&#39;t.*
	&quot;How did  you find me?&quot; She asked curiously and he tilted his 
head.
	&quot;I paid a visit to our mutual friend recently. I knew she had been 
back here not too long ago so I thought it was a good of a place as any 
to start looking. Then I picked up  these little pings and followed 
them. And low and behold, look who I found.&quot; He stood at that and 
Setsuna winced, stepping back. He glowered at her and gave a feral grin. 
&quot;Oh I&#39;m going to have fun with you.&quot; He hissed, stepping closer. &quot;Not 
only are you a senshi, someone whom I would take great pleasure in 
harming anyway, but you&#39;re Kira-chan&#39;s senshi. Even if she didn&#39;t know 
that till recently.&quot; He stepped closer and Setsuna swallowed hard. 
	&quot;What does that have to do with anything?&quot; She asked, doing her 
best to keep a level voice. He only smirked, tilting his head.
	&quot;You really don&#39;t know do you? What you did to her? How she is now 
because of you?&quot; He growled and Setsuna frowned lightly. &quot;I knew even 
before she met you that she wasn&#39;t  having much fun enjoying the 
pleasure&#39;s of life. And, at least when she was with you, she&#39;d still 
talk to me and the others. She was happy. But when you left, do you know 
what that did to her? Do you even care?&quot; He snarled, his voice rising. 
&quot;You devastated her.  Nothing mattered to her anymore. Not even when the 
godforsaken Queen fell and we were all freed did she care. She wouldn&#39;t 
play anymore, not with me. Not with anybody. She broke contact with her 
own kind, with the only kin she&#39;d known. She barely ate enough to 
survive, cursing herself and her heritage. Blaming it and us for driving 
you away!&quot; He was almost yelling now and Setsuna kept stepping backwards 
as he advanced, terrified by him, but entranced by his story. 
	&quot;Once she thought you had died, that you were gone, I thought it 
would get better. I thought she would just get over you. But it only 
became worse! She started hating the rest of us for who we were. She 
started fighting with us when we tried to drink around her. She even 
killed other demons to keep them from harming humans! She was killing us 
in your memory! &quot;He shouted, flashbacking at the thought.
******
	Akio smirked as he cornered the girl, feeling the fear radiate off 
of her. 					Her top was ripped somewhat and 
she was trying to hold it up even as she 				backed 
away. Tears ran down her face as he walked closer. 
     &quot;Now what was that you said to my friend?&quot; He asked curiously as 
his 					eyes started to glow red. &quot;That he 
couldn&#39;t get you even if he forced you?&quot; 				Her 
eyes flicked as another younger vampire approached beside him, 					
headstrong, already learning to feed off fear and Akio loved helping 
him. 				He passed Akio on his way to the girl and 
Akio smirked. &quot;Well, lets see if 				that&#39;s true.&quot; 
He said with a laugh as Yuri made to leap at the girl. There 				
was a blur to the side and suddenly a figure stood between them and the 				
girl. Akio furrowed his brow at the sight. &quot;Kira-chan, what are you 
doing?&quot;    
     Kira growled at him.
	&quot;I should ask you that. She&#39;s just a child Akio-san, what the hell 
are you 			teaching that boy?&quot; Akio laughed at her. 
	&quot;I&#39;m teaching him that humans are food Kira-chan. Nothing more 
than 					fodder for us to feed on. As it 
should be. &quot; Yuri growled beside him.
     &quot;You make me sick.&quot; Kira snarled, tensing. &quot;Leave her be.&quot; Akio 
rolled his eyes. If Kira wanted to be all protective let her be. There 
were plenty of others to pick from and he didn&#39;t feel like alienating 
Kira completely. 
	&quot;Very well. &quot; He conceded but Yuri snarled. 
	&quot;Like Hell I&#39;m going to leave! That&#39;s my meal!&quot; He charged at Kira 
and Akio only closed his eyes, fully expecting Kira to send the boy 
stumbling back as he was no match for her. He heard Yuri yell, and the 
girl scream, and was shocked to hear a gurgling sound. Opening his eyes 
he watched Yuri stumble back, a stake through his heart. He watched in 
shock as Yuri fell to his knees and crumbled to ash. In near horror he 
looked up at Kira. 	
     &quot;What are doing? He was one of us!&quot; He snarled but Kira only knelt 
beside the girl as she looked at Kira in fright.
	&quot;We are better off without his kind.&quot; She growled before meeting 
the 				girls eyes. &quot;Sleep now.&quot;  She whispered and 
entranced the girl fell into 					her arms. She 
stood with the girl held close. 
     &quot;Where are you going?&quot; He demanded watching her walk right through 
what remained of Yuri, the dust fluttering about. 
     &quot;I&#39;m taking her home.&quot; She hissed as she passed him. He watched and 
could hear her whispering. &quot;There there little one. Sleep sound now. 
Those demons won&#39;t hurt you anymore.&quot; Not sure if he was in more shock 
that she had killed his prot&#130;g&#130; without apology, or that she had said 
specifically &#39;those demons&#39; and &#39;his kind&#39; as if she weren&#39;t one, he 
only watched her disappear down the road.                                                				
******
	The memory resurged his anger and he leapt forward, forcing 
Setsuna  to bump up against the door, looking at him in shock. &quot;Even now 
a thousand years later she&#39;s not the same. She only feeds to survive, 
she only goes out to eat. Do you know that when she sleeps she still 
cries out your name? You cursed her for life you little bitch!&quot; Akio 
snarled now, glowing red and sprouting his fangs. &quot;You ruined her, 
ruined the great vampire that she was. And now I&#39;m going to ruin you. 
I&#39;ll end the reign of the senshi and throw you from her mind for the 
last time. I won&#39;t let the memory of you haunt her anymore!&quot; Setsuna had 
tears in her eyes, not just from fear as he stalked closer, but from his 
words. What she had done to Kira, that Kira still cared about her. She 
closed her eyes as he approached until a  warmth radiated from behind 
her. She opened her eyes quickly and watched him back away from her as 
quickly as he could. He knew he wasn&#39;t any match for the power of the 
Queen which was what it felt like.
	&quot;I know where you are now little fool. And once I&#39;ve taken care of 
your friends I&#39;ll be back for you and the rest of the senshi. The time 
of the Millennium Kingdom is over! We rule now.&quot; With a final snarl he 
swirled his cape around him and disappeared from view as Setsuna found 
herself slumping into a chair. Weak from the fear she had to sit down. 
She knew that if it had not been for Usagi, he would&#39;ve taken her life. 
But if was not the fear of death that caused the tears. She had tried so 
hard, so hard to be strong but hearing him talk... Knowing that Kira 
still loved her, that even now she still cared, despite what Setsuna had 
done... Unable to help it she started to cry, not caring about anything 
else.
	&quot;Kira-chan, Kira-chan.&quot; She sobbed, tears tearing themselves from 
her eyes with the same pain that Kira?s memory tore at her heart. &quot;I&#39;m 
so sorry Kira-chan, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;  She stayed like that, bent over 
crying until loud knocks forced her to look up. 
	&quot;Setsuna-san? Um, I can&#39;t feel it anymore. Can we come back?&quot; 
Usagi&#39;s voice sounded through the door and she almost smiled. She knew 
that they had to have heard her crying and everything that Akio had said 
if they were right outside the door, but Usagi was still trying to give 
her privacy. Hurriedly she wiped the tears from her eyes and composed 
herself, making it seem as though nothing had happened, greatful that 
she knew they would all play along, and called out.
	&quot;Yes, it&#39;s okay. You may come now.&quot; The door slowly opened and 
Usagi peeked in. Once she saw that Setsuna looked okay she and the 
others trooped through the door. Inside the room Usagi sat across from 
Setsuna and Haruka and Makoto went to the open door, looking outside for 
any intruders.
	&quot;He&#39;s gone by now. He knows he wouldn&#39;t stand a chance against the 
power of the crystal.&quot; Not completely convinced, Haruka and Makoto 
returned.
	&quot;If Usagi-chan can beat him by herself, we should go after him. We 
should be able to obliterate him as a group.&quot; Setsuna shook her head at 
Haruka&#39;s words.
	&quot;It&#39;s true that Akio-san wouldn&#39;t be a match for the full power of 
the crystal, but I doubt Usagi-chan can control it to it&#39;s fullest 
extent. Besides, there are many powerful demons and vampires that I&#39;m 
sure he&#39;s already contacting. Our best bet is to find Ami-chan and 
Rei-chan. He may be going after them now. And if he could follow the 
pings here, it might not take Kira-san that long to sense them either so 
we need to move fast.&quot; Haruka nodded and Setsuna pulled out the device, 
studying it for a moment. Luna looked over her shoulder and nodded 
grimly.
	&quot;It&#39;s located them. Let&#39;s go.&quot; Everyone transformed and headed 
out. Uranus watched Pluto as she began following Jupiter and Venus out 
the door. Not one to tiptoe about as the others were, and unable to 
force her roommates cries from her thoughts so quickly she put a hand on 
her shoulder, even as Neptune tried to stop her.
	&quot;Hey Pluto.&quot; She said and said senshi turned and regarded her 
cooly. &quot;Even though Mercury and Jupiter and Mars and Venus are all set 
now, it seems as though you and yours need to get it together too.&quot; 
Uranus was considerably shocked when Pluto&#39;s face turned harder than 
she&#39;d ever seen before.
	&quot;You know not of what you speak Uranus.&quot; Pluto nearly hissed. 
&quot;What is done is done, and what is in the past shall stay there.&quot; Uranus 
huffed and ignored Neptune&#39;s tug on her arm.
	&quot;If it had stayed there this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. But obviously 
it is.&quot; She said annoyed and Pluto all but slammed her staff into the 
ground.
	&quot;You are correct about that Uranus. What was an issue in the past 
is still an issue.&quot; She hissed and Uranus widened her eyes slightly. 
&quot;Nothing has changed since then. Nothing. So let it be.&quot; She said, her 
voice softer. Uranus looked to see Pluto squeeze her eyes shut for a 
moment before opening them and almost pleading with Uranus. &quot;Just, let 
it be.&quot; She turned and walked out the door. Uranus closed her eyes and 
sighed quietly as Neptune held her arms tightly. She motioned with her 
head and together they followed Pluto out the door. Sailor Moon watched 
as her senshi walked out, eyes downcast and sighed to herself. She 
followed them slowly doing her best to bring up memories of a past life, 
and issues not brought to light.</pre>
