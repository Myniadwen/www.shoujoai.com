<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 22 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Nicole Mizuno looked across her office&#39;s desk as she
ate her lunch, an amused look on her face. &quot;I think
Setsuna is right,&quot; she smiled, dark blue hair falling
into her eyes, &quot;I probably would be playing cheering
section if I went along on your date, too.&quot;

Ami Mizuno chuckled softly, her eyes clearly amused.
The scarred young woman had never been much for
laughing even before her injury, but now it was
pleasantly surprising to hear her laugh once more.
&quot;It&#39;s not really a date,&quot; she protested, &quot;we are
bringing the others along and all.&quot;

Nicole raised a delicate eyebrow, &quot;Close enough, I
think.&quot; She ate a bit then asked, &quot;I&#39;m still surprised
to hear you know the Three Lights, the nurses here
would just die with jealousy.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not as if I have much choice,&quot; Ami said wryly,
&quot;they do attend our school, and besides that they seem
to have adopted me.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Nicole looked curiously.

&quot;They seem to find it pleasant that I&#39;m distinctly
unawed by them,&quot; Ami explained, the black clad young
woman looking surprisingly comfortable in the office
chair.

&quot;I may not care for their musical stylings,&quot; Nicole
noted mildly, &quot;but they are quite popular.&quot; She
smiled, &quot;There are even quite a few patients who are
fans.&quot;

Ami shrugged, wondering if in other circumstances she
might have been one of those big fans too, then she
dismissed the thought. &quot;Do you want me to suggest
paying a visit?&quot; she asked, seeing Nicole&#39;s eyes light
up.

Reigning herself in Nicole said, &quot;Yes, but let&#39;s save
it for an emergency maybe. A seriously ill person can
be helped to recover by positive influences....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll warn Seiya not to try to charm too many of the
nurses,&quot; Ami added, thinking of the black haired young
man.

&quot;He&#39;s that much of a playboy?&quot; Nicole asked.

Ami hesitated, wanting to be fair. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; she
conceded, &quot;though that&#39;s certainly the image he&#39;s
trying to project.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an act, then?&quot; Nicole stabbed a sausage and
munched delicately.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Ami said thoughtfully, &quot;Taiki comes across
as a reserved intellectual, Yaten as a bishonen
innocent and Seiya is the wild playboy.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s all a marketing ploy,&quot; Nicole said cynically,
&quot;setting out to appeal to the broadest female
demographic.&quot;

&quot;Or they could just be lucky they fit those roles,&quot;
Ami noted. She got up, stretching, &quot;Michiru wanted me
to tell you that a dinner invitation is always open,
mother.&quot;

Finishing up her rice Nicole got up as well as she
smiled self-mockingly, &quot;I&#39;d actually like to invite
all of you over, but being on call makes it a bit
difficult.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Ami reached out to take Nicole&#39;s hand,
squeezing it gently.

&quot;I feel terribly guilty at times,&quot; Nicole said as she
walked her daughter through the halls.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Ami looked over at her curiously as they
entered the elevator, pressing the button for the
first floor.

&quot;I was gone so much when you were younger,&quot; Nicole
admitted, &quot;while it made you self-sufficient, I wish I
had been there more.&quot;

Ami gently squeezed her mother&#39;s arm through her white
lab coat. &quot;The work you do here is important, you&#39;re
saving lives,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ve always understood
that.&quot;

They walked through the busy first floor, and Nicole
fought back a smile as her daughter simply didn&#39;t
notice the adoring gazes as the female staff. The
brooding, intense young woman dressed in a boy&#39;s
school uniform was surprisingly attractive, and it was
her innocence about it that made her even more
charismatic.

&quot;When you were younger, I&#39;d always comfort myself with
the thought that I&#39;d make it up to you later,&quot; Nicole
confessed as they reached the doors, &quot;then later came
and you were gone.&quot;

Ami turned and hugged her mother, the slightly smaller
young woman holding on a comforting moment. &quot;You&#39;re a
good mother,&quot; she reassured her softly, &quot;believe me.&quot;

&quot;Liar,&quot; Nicole teased, trying not to cry at the sudden
surge of caring that she had for her daughter.
Reluctantly letting her go she asked, &quot;Are you and
Setsuna seeing each other tonight?&quot;

&quot;No, not today,&quot; Ami waved as she walked out to the
parking lot, &quot;I&#39;ve got to clean house sometime, I
suppose.&quot;

&quot;Have fun,&quot; Nicole chuckled, &quot;and say hi to Chibi-Usa
for me as well.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Ami nodded then was off. In a few moments
she was in her little car and off, driving with the
same focus she brought to almost everything in her
life.

&quot;I&#39;m glad she gets permission from school to skip out
like this,&quot; Nicole sighed, &quot;or she&#39;ll really be in
trouble.&quot; Silently she added, &#39;Though considering her
grades she could skip classes for weeks and probably
pass.&#39;

Ami made her way home, eventually arriving at her
apartment, watching as Haruka pulled up to drop off a
pink haired little girl. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ami bowed as
Chibi-Usa got out, her backpack also a blazing pink.

&quot;You helped take care of Hotaru for us before,&quot; the
sandy haired woman waved it off as Haruka continued,
&quot;giving Chibi-Usa a ride home is the least I can do.&quot;
She leaned up against the car, &quot;Setsuna is tied up
tonight by a teacher conference.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Ami admitted, &quot;or I think I&#39;d be inviting
her over, or something.&quot; She bent to give Chibi-Usa a
hug, &quot;How was school?&quot;

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Chibi-Usa admitted, &quot;and Hotaru and I had
lunch together.&quot;

&quot;Did you share one of Michiru&#39;s bentos?&quot; Ami chuckled
as Chibi-Usa nodded eagerly. She looked up at Haruka,
&quot;Should I meet you later for our patrol?&quot;

&quot;Ten p.m.,&quot; Haruka agreed as she climbed into her car,
starting the engine up then driving off with a cheery
wave.

&quot;I&#39;d like to go out on patrol with you all,&quot; Chibi-Usa
said as she held on to Ami&#39;s hand while they walked
into the building.

&quot;If you weren&#39;t in school I&#39;d think about it,&quot; Ami
admitted as they walked to the elevator, the eyes of
other residents on them. She knew that she was
considered a single mother, a odd position for a teen
like herself, especially with a daughter who looked so
different than she did. The looks annoyed her at
times, but she tried not to think about it.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Luna sat up from where she lounged on the
carpet by the doorway, the little black cat falling
into step beside them as they entered.

&quot;Hello Luna,&quot; Chibi-Usa picked her up and hugged the
black cat affectionately.

Ami saw the panicked look on the cat&#39;s face and had to
grin. &quot;Anything new on our new enemy?&quot; she asked the
cat curiously.

&quot;Artemis and I met earlier today,&quot; Luna wiggled free
of Chibi-Usa&#39;s grip, &quot;but neither of us could remember
anything from the Moon Kingdom era that might relate.&quot;
She brightened, &quot;I do know something about the three
new Senshi.&quot;

&quot;Really?&#39; Chibi-Usa asked eagerly.

&quot;I think they&#39;re the Starlights,&quot; Luna said, &quot;the Moon
Kingdom had an encounter with them, but there&#39;s little
detail on them other than a name and description.&quot;

&quot;I guess what I&#39;m wondering,&quot; Ami asked seriously as
she set her school bag and Chibi-Usa&#39;s backpack on the
dining table, &quot;is are they enemies or allies?&quot;

&quot;In that era they were allies,&quot; Luna said, &quot;though as
Artemis pointed out to me that it doesn&#39;t necessarily
apply to now.&quot;

&quot;Still, it&#39;s useful to know,&quot; Ami mused. She looked
over at Chibi-Usa, &quot;I want you to do your homework
first, then you can go play.&quot;

&quot;But Ami,&quot; Chibi-Usa pouted.

&quot;You&#39;ll have plenty of time later,&quot; Ami was firm, &quot;and
if it helps, I&#39;ll be cooking dinner and doing
housework while you do it.&quot;

Chibi-Usa nodded reluctantly, &quot;Yes Ami.&quot;

As the little girl was leaving the kitchen Luna
murmured to Ami, &quot;You&#39;re sounding more motherly every
day.&quot;

Ami shuddered, &quot;There&#39;s a pleasant thought.&quot;</pre>
