<h1>Desperately Searching (part 7 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/despsearch-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Haruka was a Skyling, a fine, seasoned warrior like all of her kind, and 
she knew better than to open her eyes or make any sign of wakefulness 
before analyzing her immediate surroundings for any sign of danger.  The 
winged woman let her senses identify the hot, dry, and incredibly silent 
signs of a desert, the faint wind filling the area slightly more humid 
and cooler.  She was not far from the forest she had been flying over 
when her wings gave out, the feathers too dry and oil-less to keep her 
aloft any longer.  She had to find another source of oil for her wings 
or she would never fly again.
 
She heard no movement in the room with her, so she opened her emerald 
eyes, fighting the wave of nausea that overcame her at the closeness of 
the stone walls.  Haruka&#39;s eyes flew to the opening, a circular hole 
ringed by pale stone, and she rolled over, scrambling to get out of the 
cave.
 
She panted when she exited into the fierce sunlight, raising her left 
arm to cover her face.  She winced as pain shot through her, and she 
lowered her aching arm.  She gingerly probed her bruised arm with her 
long fingers, sighing when she realized that it wasn&#39;t broken.  It hurt, 
though.  Haruka stretched out her golden wings one at a time, carefully 
examining them for injuries.  Her wings were bruised, swollen, and 
painful, but the worse damage was to her ribs.  She was able to count 
four broken, but Skylings&#39; large lungs were nearly puncture-proof.  Two 
more of the fragile bones were tender but not broken, and Haruka 
wondered how she was going to bind them so they&#39;d heal.
 
&quot;Skyling?&quot;
 
Haruka fell into a fighting stance instantly, wings half-spread for 
flight, ignoring the pain in her body as her instincts took over.  She 
stared at the slender white-skinned woman crouching in the sand beside 
the cave, her long golden hair caressing the sands.  She had a double 
set of transparent golden wings folded along her spine, twitching as the 
warrior stared at her, iridescent scales shimmering in the light.  Her 
pale blue eyes scanned the area, coming back to rest on Haruka&#39;s 
battle-ready form, waiting patiently.  Haruka let her eyes take in the 
strange shirt the woman wore as she straightened.  Her skirt was similar 
in style to a Skyling&#39;s, though it was shorter and less tapered, and her 
shirt was backless, but it seemed to be part of her skirt, no hole for 
her belly button to show, a simple sash knotted around her waist holding 
it to her body.  How very strange.  Haruka stood up, catching her breath 
as pain lanced through her from her injured ribs.
 
&quot;Are you okay, Skyling?&quot;
 
Haruka shook her head, all of her warrior instincts screaming at her to 
leave and not reveal her disability to the stranger.  She spoke for the 
first time, never noticing the flush cover the other woman&#39;s face at the 
sensuality she unintentionally exuded with her faintly masculine voice.  
&quot;My ribs and my arm.  Why?&quot;
 
The Faeri moved forward slowly, hands outstretched.  Haruka froze as the 
faeri touched her arm with her tiny hands, and all pain vanished.  The 
blonde faeri rested her cool hands on Haruka&#39;s belly under her tight 
half-shirt, and her ribs stopped hurting.  Her legs also healed, the 
swelling going down.
 
&quot;You healed me,&quot; Haruka whispered, shocked.  &quot;Who are you, Faeri?&quot;
 
&quot;I am Minako, Crown Princess and future Queen of the Faeri People.  Who 
are you, Skyling who lost her footing on the clouds?&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka, princess and future queen of the Skyfolk.  If I decide to go 
back.  If my father even realizes that I&#39;m missing.&quot;
 
&quot;You left your home without letting anyone know where you were going?  
Why?&quot;
 
&quot;My father is what we call a mahk-reevah, a male obsessed with 
patriarchal lineage.  In my kingdom, because of our constant wars and 
uncertain lives riding the winds, the only parenthood we know for 
certain is our mother.  So our society is matrilineal.  I&#39;m the oldest 
princess and I know that my father always wished that he had no 
daughters.  My sister doesn&#39;t mind or notice, but if I fell off a cliff 
and died, Kotori would be glad to relinquish her claim to the throne and 
my brother Eiki would ascend.  She is probably the only one who misses 
me, besides my servant.&quot;
 
&quot;Your mother would be proud of your search, Haruka-san.&quot;  Minako grinned 
at Haruka&#39;s shock.  &quot;I can sense certain things, princess.  Once you 
began speaking, I could see that you left your mountains with a purpose.  
You say that you wish to find your people&#39;s ancestral home by the sea, 
but I know that you want to prove yourself to be worthy of your mother&#39;s 
throne.  And she, Wind Rider, would be proud of you, Wind Runner.  I 
promise you that.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;How did you know that my mother was called 
Kazeko the Wind Rider?  Only my people know.&quot;
 
&quot;I know.  I also know that she was the greatest warrior the mountains 
have ever known.  She created the peace, she won the last of the Great 
Wars of Unification&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;Then she vanished in the worst snow storm in a millennia,&quot; Haruka 
finished.  &quot;It wasn&#39;t a story, then.  You Faeri do have powers.  Magical 
powers.  You can know stuff about someone just from looking at them.&quot;
 
&quot;Something like that.  You were heading for the sea when you fell?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah.  I think I missed, though.&quot;  Haruka closed her eyes as a wave of 
dizziness passed over her, grateful for the little Faeri who caught her 
and kept her from falling.  She tried to open her wings for balance, but 
the pain from that motion dropped her to her knees, and the Faeri 
grunted.
 
&quot;Maybe we can get you to a safe place.  If you&#39;re claustrophobic, there 
are some nice trees in the forest . . . and it&#39;s cooler there.  I know 
you&#39;re not used to the heat.&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t fell so good,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;Do you have 
anything to eat in those trees?&quot;
 
&quot;Faeries are vegetarians, but the Flame Walkers are insectivores and 
carnivores.  I guess you Skyfolk are omnivores, so we can find you 
something.  Anharraaht!&quot;
 
Minako&#39;s strange call brought a lithe woman out of the sands, red hair 
flowing down her back like a waterfall of fire, eyes a pair of fierce 
purple coals, clad in a skin-tight red shirt and skirt, chains of amber, 
rubies, and garnets hanging around her waist, neck, and arms, fine 
iridescent scales covering her arms and legs, clawed fingers webbed to 
allow easy movement through her sandy home.  Her pointed ears turned 
toward Haruka, the transparent inner membrane over each eye retracting.  
&quot;The Skyling is awake.  What&#39;s wrong with her, Minako?  You healed her, 
didn&#39;t you?&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s not used to this heat, Rei, and I think she may be sick.  From 
one of your little poisonous critters.&quot;
 
Rei moved closer, flattened nostrils flaring as her purple eyes 
narrowed.  &quot;Yes, I believe you are correct.  Do you not have poisonous 
animals in your mountains?&quot;
 
&quot;No.  And it never gets this hot up there.&quot;
 
&quot;This is a cool day for the desert.  Minako, let me help you get her to 
the forest.  Do you know where the nearest Elf settlement is?&quot;
 
&quot;I know where the palace is,&quot; Minako answered as Rei slipped under 
Haruka&#39;s other arm and the three of them headed for the treeline.  &quot;The 
princess is open to other races, so I could try to contact her.  They 
have medicines that you would not, since your people are immune to the 
creatures of the sands.&quot;
 
Rei glanced over at the Skyling, taking in her tanned, scale-free skin, 
her feathered wings, her emerald eyes, her short hair, her strange 
clothes, her inner eyelids that fluttered with every dry gust, and the 
claws on the tips of her fingers, retracted as soon as she was sure that 
the Flame Walker was safe.  &quot;Can you not fly, Skyling?&quot;
 
&quot;Call me Haruka,&quot; she whispered, her voice almost masculine and filled 
with a casual sensuality the Flame Walker had never heard before.  &quot;I 
lost a lot of feathers when I fell, and the ones that are left are too 
dry from lack of oil to attempt flight.  Until I find an alternative 
source of oil or another way to stimulate my oil glands, I won&#39;t fly.&quot;
 
&quot;We&#39;ll get you fixed up,&quot; Minako promised.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Elf Princess?&quot;
 
Makoto opened her eyes at the soft call, staring at the Faeri woman 
standing in her bedroom window, golden hair moving softly with the 
gentle wind.  Her pale blue eyes searched the room, coming back to rest 
on the brunette princess.  &quot;Hello, little Faeri.  I didn&#39;t know you 
people existed.&quot;
 
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have revealed myself, Elf, but I have a sick friend from two 
mountain ranges west that needs your help.  She&#39;s been stung by 
something from the desert, but Rei and the Flame Walkers are immune and 
have no idea how to treat her.  She and I thought that you Elves would 
have more experience healing sick people than us.&quot;
 
&quot;Your friend is not from around here?  What is she, a Darkling?  No, 
they never leave their caves.  A Skyling?&quot;  Makoto&#39;s breath caught as 
the blonde Faeri nodded, shock and anticipation filling her frame.  She 
had never seen a Skyling before.  They were legend, creatures of almost 
mythical proportion by the Sea, and she had always hoped that they would 
return to its shores some day.  &quot;If she is, than she&#39;s probably also 
suffering from heat fever.  I have some herbs that will help, but she&#39;ll 
have to be moved to the edge of a bay I know.  We can use the water to 
cool her fever, at least a little.  And I have some Merfolk friends who 
can help us keep an eye on her.&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s claustrophobic,&quot; the Faeri warned.  &quot;She won&#39;t stay in a cave 
unless it&#39;s pretty large.  She can stay in a tree, but the weather may 
get wet . . .&quot;
 
&quot;I know.  I have a few ideas.  How long have you been watching me?  I 
mean, how did you know that I&#39;m the princess?  I never saw you before.&quot;
 
&quot;I hid, Makoto-san.  I was there, in the trees, the day Ami-san first 
introduced you to her cousin the princess.  I can sense that she has 
been here, in the waters below the palace, so your father must have 
accepted her in the past month or so.  True?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.  What is your name, Faeri?&quot;
 
&quot;Minako.  Can you come now?  Do you have herbs here that you can bring?&quot;
 
&quot;Some . . . I do need to see her.&quot;
 
&quot;You look strong, Elf.  I am not, and the Skyling is not small and 
light.  You can help Rei move her to the Bay.  Come now, please?&quot;
 
Makoto grabbed her tunic and pants, shoving her feet into her boots as 
she swung her bow and quiver over one shoulder, a small bag filled with 
herbs and potions on the other.  Without a backward look, she leapt out 
the window behind the Faeri and slipped into the silent forest.  In the 
castle, an aging king smiled as his daughter vanished, knowing that she 
was going to help an injured member of another species.  Not one like 
the Faeri she was following, and probably not a Flame Walker or Sea 
Person, but someone.  Long ago, a great peace had blanketed the 
continent, but civil wars had separated the individual species into 
factions and later destroyed many of the treaties.  Makoto and the young 
princesses like her were the best hope for a new world.</pre>
