<p>Basic Piracy Taught  by Hino-sensei</p>
<p>A heartfelt but rather  boisterous laugh echoed throughout the battleship, all non-veteran  crew mates cringing at the sound of their captain finding <em>something</em> amusing. Captain Haruka was known for scaring away fleets with just  her laugh, but it seemed, these visitors would not be so easily  intimidated. Indeed, the raven-haired one was blushing a light  crimson, feet rooted to the ground as she fought to not look at her  small audience. The cause for Haruka's laughter, the Senshi of Love  herself, however, did not see any reason for shame, and so tucked her  hands behind her back, and smiled with shared mirth. Rei doubted if  Minako even knew why they were laughing, so long as they were in a  good mood.</p>
<p>Good,  and charitable, it seemed. “All right.” Haruka gasped  for breath and swiped away the tears that had squeezed out in her  spout of laughter. “You want to borrow my ship and crew  Minako-chan? Go right ahead. Actually, I'm rather interested in  seeing how Rei-chan plans to teach you this. What do you think  Makoto? Should we relearn the trade? Perhaps her point of view  would 'enlighten' us.”</p>
<p>The  brunette nodded, a twinkle of laughter still in her eyes as she  smiled back. “By all means, we didn't have the pleasure of  having a personal teacher before- why not? Rei-chan? Would you mind  two more students?”</p>
<p>At  that, Rei's blush deepened, now surely doubting if she could live up  to Minako's plan. It wasn't as if she was a true blue pirate  herself, or had even extensively studied them. In all honesty, she  probably knew for sure just about as much as Minako, without the  fantasy book stereotypes. It seemed obvious that all she could do at  this point was wing it and pray that Kami-sama still guided her  afterwards.</p>
<p>The duo  had made it safely aboard the Zephyr, Aino's ship connected to it by  a makeshift wooden bridge of a long plank and two ropes secured by  customary sailor's knots. Haruka had recognized them instantly, and  as good as welcomed them with open arms. As of that moment, Minako  had just finished explaining her “deal” to the two pirate  captains, which had been received with ample amusement.</p>
<p>Haruka  leaned forward as she prompted the priestess into immediate action.  “So what's the first step, Rei-sensei?”</p>
<p>Startled,  Rei looked up at Haruka. <em>The first step? They want to get  started already?</em> At the sounds of encouragement from her other  students, Rei sighed. “We should do something about Captain  Aino's crew and ship. I think they should continue on with their  route, and return to the Kingdom on schedule. In case we miss the  deadline for some reason... let them tell Mina-chan's uncle that we  were kidnapped by pirates, which, besides being willing, is basically  what's happening. That sound all right?”</p>
<p>Makoto  nodded. “Fair enough. Minako-chan, why don't you go play  messenger for us? Since you're supposed to be their captain, go with  Raoul- he's the big guy that's like a foot taller than any of us- to  the side of the ship and tell them to return to their route without  you. I think we'd both like to talk to Rei-chan alone in the  meantime.”</p>
<p>Minako  sent a worried glance towards Rei, before smiling softly and nodding  her head. “Okay.” Leaning over, she quickly pecked Rei  on the cheek, not the least bit concerned of privacy, and skipped to  the doorway. “I won't be gone long, so try not to miss me, k?  Back in a few!” And then she was gone.</p>
<p>Suddenly  finding herself weary, Rei slumped back down in her seat. Across  from her, Makoto and Haruka exchanged mischievous glances. Haruka  started, “It seems a lot has changed since we last saw you. If  my eyes don't deceive me... are you two a couple?”</p>
<p>Like a  flare on a moonless night, Rei's complexion exploded with a bright  crimson. After a brief moment, however, she managed a slow nod.</p>
<p>Leaning  forward, Makoto asked, “So when did this come about?”</p>
<p>“About...”  Rei hesitated, but her soft answer was easily heard by the other two.   “About twenty minutes ago, I suppose. Actually, that's pretty  much when we resolved to do this pirate thing. Mina-chan came up  with a rather strange way to... convince me. A couple of ways, come  to think of it.”</p>
<p>“Care  to share?” An ever so slight fang came from between Makoto's  lips as she found herself being drawn to know every detail.</p>
<p>“If  I don't have to, no, not really. Sorry, I thank you for letting us  use your ship for what Mina-chan calls her 21st birthday  present, but I don't really want to spread the news just yet.”</p>
<p>Haruka  nodded. “Yeah, sure, I get what you're saying. That's fine.  And don't worry about the 'birthday present'. Like I said, I'd like  to be schooled in this too. I never really liked lessons, to tell  you the truth, but my gut tells me this will turn out to be a grand  adventure in itself. And if I get to meet the other Senshi as a  result? No harm done. Right, Mako?”</p>
<p>Makoto  nodded in response. “Yeah, this'll be fun. I'm just taking a  wild guess here but, Rei-chan, you probably don't know all that much  about being a pirate, do you?”</p>
<p>Rei  smiled wanly. “Is it obvious?”</p>
<p>She  shrugged. “Nah, not really. If you act like you know what  you're doing, no one will know differently- not even us at some  point, I think. Even if I'm going to be a 'student' too, I wish you  luck, Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>Another  sigh escaped Rei's lips. “Thanks... I get the feeling I'm  going to need it.”</p>
<p>Just  then, Minako bounced back in, a cheerful smile on her face.  “Oki-doki. That's that. What's next, Rei-sensei?”</p>
<p>By then, Rei had at least  figured that much out. The way Minako's dress spun as she skipped in  only reassured her of the necessity. “Haruka-san, Makoto-san,  do-”</p>
<p>“Hold it hold it.”   Haruka put her hands up for the generalized gesture for Rei to stop  talking. “First of all. We're all Senshi, we're all friends,  so let's drop the respective honorifics. Only Rei-chan gets to be  called something different, right Rei-sensei?”</p>
<p>Somehow, Rei had a twinge  of instinct that told her she was going to get annoyed to death by  the change in reference, at least towards her, but agreed to the  terms. Makoto backed up Haruka's idea, pointing to all of them in  turn to make sure they had the names right. “Yeah, see  Mako-chan, Ruka-chan, and Mina-chan are learning from Rei-sensei this  week, aren't we?”</p>
<p>A dual chorus of “Hai!”  came out from the blonds, who laughed lightly before turning their  attention to their already stressed teacher. Rubbing away a growing  headache, Rei managed to grind out in a somewhat neutral tone, “Fine.   Mako-chan, Ruka-chan, you wouldn't happen to have two extra sets of  clothing we could borrow, do you? I doubt many pirates wear these  kinds of dresses at sea. And besides, they're fairly new so I don't  want them to get... messed up by the lessons.”</p>
<p>If she didn't have their  attention before, she certainly had it now. Mina slowly asked,  “Umm... Rei-sensei? What exactly are the lesson plans?”</p>
<p>At that, Rei only smiled  and waggled her finger in front of Mina's face, as they were seated  next to each other. “It's a secret. You'll take it as it  comes.”</p>
<p>Upon seeing the slight tint  of apprehension in Mina's baby-blue eyes, Rei began to warm up to the  idea of teaching them. <em>This looks to be a fun experience after  all...</em></p>
<p>Broad  grins on their faces, both Haruka and Makoto stood. Rei and Minako,  taking the hint, also stood. “Yeah, we have plenty of other  outfits. Is Rei-sensei going to change our garb, too?”</p>
<p>Rei  sent a slight frown in Makoto's direction. “We'll see when we  get there.”</p>
<p>The  dressing room was well stocked, to say the least. Although they were  on a ship, to full-length mirrors hung on one wall, while the rest of  the space was lined with hung outfits of varying styles and colors.  Like a health inspector would a kitchen, Rei went down every aisle,  looking at ever single outfit. The second time around was much  faster, as she knew what she wanted and selected four of them.  Returning to the awaiting women, she passed each of them their  designated outfit, leaving hers in her hands. “All right,  let's get changed, shall we?”</p>
<p>The  next hour alone was spent stripping and replacing their clothes with  the new garments- ones never having been worn as of previously. The  half hour after that took them next door where they selected a  certain amount of certain types of jewelry and accessories. When Rei  declared that she was finished with the ensemble, bootery included,  even Haruka and Makoto had to admit that they were impressed.</p>
<p>Makoto's  wardrobe was composed of a forest green long blouse with a darker  shade for tight leggings- both trimmed in silver. Chest bindings  could be seen through the low collar, while a thick silver ribbon  tied down the bottom portion of her blouse as well as keeping up her  leggings. Leather boots that came halfway up her shins had broad  inch high heels, though the length of the shoes themselves were  snugly narrow to a rounded point. Her rose earrings were ever  present, as were two sharp ruby rings, for her two middle fingers.  Her hair was tied in its usual ponytail, but accompanied by a  streaming head ribbon. After seeing her completely dressed up, Rei  believed she could have passed for a cross between a sturdy black  belt fighter and an elf of legend, but she didn't need to tell them  that. If they were satisfied, she would leave it well enough alone.</p>
<p>Haruka  sported a orange tank top tucked into khaki-colored drawstring pants.   The elastic bagginess snapped over the top of her ankle high black  boots.. On her hands and half of her forearms were long straps of  bandages, more for show than for any real necessity in protection.  Over it all, she wore the gold-trimmed black captain's coat, with a  matching captain's hat. Her unruly blonde hair poked out, but with  the hat, there seemed to be a slight darkening in her eyes,  presenting a more serious, gruff looking portrayal. Rei's analysis  was that Haruka would probably end up taking off the trench coat  before long, at least, while they were outside, as the sun would  surely make her boil within it.</p>
<p>Minako  wore a similarly simplistic outfit. Her long blonde hair was  relinquished from its customary red bow, only to be further  restrained by an intricate “fishnet braid” as the stylist  Rei called it. Gold hoop earrings matched the set of five thin gold  bracelets on her left wrist. On her right middle finger was a  citrine centralized ring (orange stone) with its miniature copies  giving it a heart-shaped border. Her garb consisted of a short  sleeved midnight blue tunic with dark orange leggings, ending in  simple dark brown leather boots. Something itched at the back of  Rei's mind, telling her that it clashed just ever so slightly, but at  the appreciative and loving smile Mina personally gave her, she  allowed herself to forget it.</p>
<p>Rei's  own choice was decidedly more... pirate themed, though it had been  unintentional at first. She had really chosen the colors out of  knowing what their Senshi auras and fukus looked like. It wasn't  exactly her fault that dark red and black happened to fit her image  the best. A sleeveless crimson shirt with a low V-neck collar, and  black leggings- both held up by a black cord that slipped around her  waist three times before being knotted off to the side- made up her  basic ensemble. Her earrings were simple ruby dots, shining visibly  with her hair tied back in a French braid comprised of three smaller  braids. A deep red half cape was tied about her neck, one that might  be compared to a poncho or a necktie at once. A pair of black  boots with a drawstring V-shaped top completed her look, almost.</p>
<p>Rei and  Haruka both wore gold-hilted daggers at their backs. Haruka's was  bigger, and she was more skilled with it, but that was not to say Rei  couldn't have efficiently used her blade if she had the need. Upon  seeing Rei tuck the sheathed blade in between the cords, Minako  whined, “Rei-chan...! How come I don't get a blade? I want  one too! Mako-chan doesn't have one either!”</p>
<p>“That's <em>Rei-sensei</em> now, or did you already forget? And you two don't  need blades- you have rings.”</p>
<p>As  attention was called to it, the ring bearers stared at their hands in  curiosity. If not before, the sharpness of every gem stood out,  their intent being recognized as far more than simple decoration. As  Rei continued, her students found themselves surprised by the length  of which she had thought of the outfits.</p>
<p>“No  offense to Mako-chan or Mina-chan, but I think blades are just a tad  bit safer in Ruka-chan and my hands. Besides, you two are more  likely to lash out with fists and kicks than draw a weapon, if  there's no time to transform. If you'll notice, both of your boots  have noticeably sharper points and heels, for better use, while still  providing a sturdy bit of friction. Ruka-chan has the coat and hat  really simply because she's the real captain of this ship, and  therefore deserves an extra spot of flare for when she enters a fight  or otherwise introduces herself to an enemy. In doing so, either may  be used to temporarily blind an opponent or disguise a prisoner or  ally, so it's not just for looks either.</p>
<p>“Mina-chan,  since both you and I have long hair, the braids make them rather  effective weapons, given you don't mind hitting or strangling another  with it, and that you keep it out of your opponent's grip so the  favor isn't returned. Mmm... oh, for Ruka-chan's and my boots,  they're broader for a better platform to place stronger kicks behind.   Between you and me, Mina-chan, it'd probably be like comparing brute  force to finesse. Ah, and lastly, for the color scheme, I simply  borrowed them from our Senshi fuku since, after all, I get the  feeling they match us better than anything else. Any questions?”</p>
<p>When  she received nothing but respectful stares, Rei nodded and finished,  “Good. There, that's your first lesson: The How and Why of  Proper Dressing. Now, before we think about the next lesson,  Ruka-chan, Mako-chan, would it be terribly hard to get a tour of the  ship and some lunch in us? I'd, in a manner of speaking, like to  know the school grounds before I really begin to 'teach.'”</p>
<p>Makoto  nodded in agreement. “Of course, we should get that over with  soon, huh? All right, let's get a move on then.”</p>
<p>As  Makoto led the way down to the first doorway, talking animately with  Minako, Haruka hung back to tell Rei, “You know, I think I was  right- this <em>will</em> be a fun week. I already feel like a learned  a handful of new things.”</p>
<p>“Learning  isn't what's important for a lesson- it's remembering it afterwards,  when it counts, that does.”</p>
<p>Haruka  nodded solemnly. “Wise words. Let's get on with the tour now,  hm?”</p>
<p>And  with that, Minako's first piracy lesson taught by Rei-sensei ended  with an overall grand success. Who knew what lay ahead, and the  fruit that Rei's work would bear? The Senshi decidedly did not.  Well, except Setsuna, the Guardian of Time, but she's always been an  exception.</p>
