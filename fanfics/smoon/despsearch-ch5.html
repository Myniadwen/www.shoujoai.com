<a href="../smoon/despsearch-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Haruka soared over the rolling hills, glad to be airborne again.  She 
had enjoyed her visit with the two Darkling princesses, but, like all 
Skylings, she was very claustrophobic and it took ever ounce of her 
self-control to enter those caves in the first place.  Luckily, unlike 
most of her people, Haruka&#39;s curiosity overrode her fear most of the 
time, but she didn&#39;t think that she could have stayed underground much 
longer.
 
She heard a cry from below, and her flight faltered as she looked down, 
spotting a small crowd of wingless ones in the town below her.  She 
circled for a moment, wondering if she should land, but she decided that 
the wingless ones could not be that dangerous.  With little more 
thought, she folded her wings and dove, opening them at the last 
possible second to land safely in a crouch, arms held up 
semi-defensively, claws retracted to keep from frightening the 
landlings.  As she folded her wings, two of the men moved forward, a 
more richly dressed woman between them.  She seemed to be the leader, 
raising a hand to stop the delegation a few feet from Haruka, afraid of 
frightening the winged woman, opening her hands to show that she carried 
no weapons.  &quot;Hello, Sky Woman,&quot; the woman greeted.
 
Haruka slowly straightened, trusting the three strangers, and stepped 
forward, albeit a bit hesitantly.  &quot;Hello, Wingless Ones.  I was just 
passing through . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Forgive our curiosity, but we haven&#39;t seen a Sky Person on this side of 
the mountains in centuries.  I am Anderaa, ruler of this province, and I 
am honored to meet you.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka, oldest daughter of King Koshu of the Skylings and heir to my 
late mother&#39;s throne,&quot; she introduced, second eyelids fluttering open.  
&quot;There used to be Skylings here?  My people used to live on this side of 
the mountains?&quot;
 
&quot;Long ago, Princess Haruka of the Sky People.&quot;
 
&quot;I came here looking for my people&#39;s ancestral home.  The Queen of 
Darkness&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;The Guardian of Time?  You spoke to her?  This is an auspicious day!  
Certainly you were sent here by the gods to bless the princess&#39;s 
engagement to the Prince of the Hills!  Haruka-hime, you must hasten to 
the palace and meet with the queen!  She will certainly want to meet 
you, almost as much as her daughter.&quot;
 
&quot;I was actually headed for the sea . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Please?  It would mean so much to her.  She&#39;s such a romantic, our 
princess.&quot;
 
Haruka bit her lip like some little fledgling, considering the lady&#39;s 
words.  &quot;I suppose a short stop won&#39;t hurt anything . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you, Haruka Princess of the Sky People!&quot;  The lady fell to one 
knee, all of her followers kneeling and bowing their heads to the 
blonde.  Haruka stammered her thanks before jumping into the air and 
soaring toward the distant silver palace.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Serenity smiled as she watched the wind play with her flowers, listening 
as the birds sang for her, sitting inches away and watching her with 
their bright little eyes.  She felt the wind change, all of her birds 
silenced by something they sensed in the air.  She looked up, shocked, 
as a huge golden eagle soared overhead.  No, that wasn&#39;t an eagle&#151;it had 
arms as well as legs and lacked a tail.  It was a winged person!  A 
Skyling!  There hadn&#39;t been Skylings in the Plains for centuries!
 
&quot;Skyling!&quot;  Some part of her reached out, desperate to keep the 
golden-winged woman from escaping, though she had no idea what prompted 
her to cry out.
 
The winged woman began to circle at the call, recognizing the 
crystal-embossed building as the palace she was aiming for.  Spotting 
the silk-clad young woman in the rose garden far below with her 
eagle-eyes, she recognized the unique hairstyle as identical to Ailan&#39;s.  
It was the royal hairstyle, then.
 
Haruka landed, wings stirring up a brief hurricane of leaves and debris 
as she folded her wings tightly against her body.  When the air cleared, 
Serenity stared at the winged woman.  &quot;Wow,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I&#39;ve never 
seen a flying woman before.&quot;  Haruka relaxed her wings, letting them 
open slightly and curl forward in curiosity.  Curious, the young 
princess reached out toward the feathered appendages with one tiny hand, 
jerking back when she brushed the edge of one of the long golden 
feathers.  The taller Skyling chuckled as she opened her wing, reaching 
out and wrapping it around the slim girl, pulling her close.
 
&quot;You look just like her,&quot; the Skyling murmured, running her long fingers 
through Serenity&#39;s shining golden hair, touching the odango-like buns on 
top of the girl&#39;s head.  &quot;It must be the royal hairstyle or something.&quot;
 
&quot;I-it is.  Every Crown Princess adopts it.  My mother doesn&#39;t wear it 
because she was never the Crown Princess; she only became queen when her 
older sister went away to become an immortal Keeper of the Light/Speaker 
of the Truth/Seer of the Path.&quot;
 
&quot;She fell in love with the Queen of Darkness/Guardian of Time/Goddess of 
Storms.  They make a beautiful couple.&quot;
 
&quot;You met them?&quot;
 
Haruka shrugged her free wing.  &quot;Yeah.  Ailan-san told me that you are 
called &#145;Usagi&#39;.  Is there any particular reason?&quot;
 
The blonde blushed.  &quot;My mother tells me that she named me for a story 
about a princess who lived on the moon and spent her life searching for 
true love.  It&#39;s a very old story, and I am told that every species has 
its own version.&quot;
 
&quot;We have a tale about a small child with white wings that was kidnapped 
by the sprites of the moon but she grew to love them and brought peace 
to the Earth.  She&#39;s the reason why there are no more attacks from the 
moon.  It&#39;s a very old, very simple story.  It&#39;s supposed to make us 
want peace between the different races.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s what my name is for.  Peace.  I&#39;m supposed to unite the Plains 
People and the Hill People through marriage in a few months.  And make 
peace.&quot;
 
Haruka pulled away slightly, letting her wing drop.  &quot;At least you have 
a way to make a difference.  I have nothing.&quot;
 
Usagi smiled and reached up to touch Haruka&#39;s face.  &quot;You&#39;ll find your 
purpose in time.  Now, my mothers sent you out here to find your ancient 
home, not me.  You need to get going, no matter what those villagers 
said.  You are all I expected from a Skyling Princess, and you will make 
a great queen like your mother.&quot;
 
&quot;How did you know?&quot;
 
Usagi smiled as she pulled away, fingering the jeweled pendant Haruka 
wore.  &quot;I know a great deal more than most people think.  I know that 
Noriko is not my mother, but I know why Ailan gave me up.  She did the 
right thing.  There&#39;s also a prophecy about you, Skyling, but you will 
discover that on your own.  Thank you for coming to see me, but now you 
must head for the sea where your destiny awaits.&quot;
 
&quot;Destiny?&quot;  Haruka opened her wings, preparing for flight, automatically 
following the princess&#39;s commands.  &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;
 
&quot;You will.  Go now, and we will meet again.&quot;
 
&quot;Wait!  Princess, I can see in you the great strength your mothers 
possess.  I know you will make a great queen one day, and I will be 
honored to be your ally.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you, Haruka.  When you finish your journey and find your home, 
come back to visit me, okay?&quot;
 
Haruka leaned down and brushed her lips across Serenity&#39;s forehead.  
&quot;I&#39;ll come back, Usagi-san.  I promise.&quot;  With that, she let the 
strengthening wind billow under her great wings and carry her into the 
darkening sky, heading away from the setting sun and toward the sea 
glistening many miles away. </pre>
