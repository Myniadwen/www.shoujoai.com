<h1>And the Desert Roars (part 5 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arashi.html">arashi-enkou</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/desertroars-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Air.

Air filled her decayed and collapsed lungs. Air made her breathe. Air 
made the shriveled organ that was once her heart pump. Air made her 
alive.

No. She wasn&#39;t alive.

She was dead. Wasn&#39;t she?

Or perhaps she was caught in the middle.

Cursed to an undead exsistence. All because of...her. That disgusting 
brat that made her weak and useless. Her...

Usagi...

&#39;I hate you...&#39; she thought as dark magic swelled in her rotten flesh. 
Fangs slid wetly from her jaws. &#39;I despise you...I&#39;ll kill you...I&#39;ll 
bathe in your blood and feast on your skin...&#39;

She was back.

She was alive. She was dead. She was the Cursed One.

She was Rei.

:::::----:::::

Dark magic.

Her first feeling as she began to awaken was the rusty taste of dark 
magic in her mouth. Someone&#39;s hatred burned her nose.

Rei...

Energy filled her body, and she nearly cried.

No...

If she was awake then she would have to--

You two shall never love again. Forever close to each other, but you may 
never again feel the love you have now. By the power of Ra, you are 
cursed...

Damn him. Damn Endiymon. He did this! He made the demon inside of her 
love awaken! He made the demon swallow Rei&#39;s soul, leaving nothing but 
hatred and an unholy thirst for blood!

But he had cursed her as well. If Rei was to ever awaken, it would be 
her duty to kill her.

She cried.

She was alive. She was broken. She was the Pure One.

She was Usagi...

::::::---:::::

Slap!

Makoto blinked at the sharp sting she felt on her cheek. &#39;Ouch.&#39;

Ami breathed harshly and shoved Makoto away from her. &quot;Y-you,&quot; she 
growled. &quot;You clout!!&quot;

Makoto arched an eyebrow at that. &quot;Short on insults are we?&quot;

&quot;How dare you even try to--have you no dignity!?&quot;

Makoto rubbed her sore cheek and shrugged. &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; she began. &quot;I ran 
out of dignity when a bunch of bastards carved this into my skin.&quot; The 
genie turned and lifted her shirt, exposing her back to Ami&#39;s view.

Ami stopped breathing.

Oh...God...

The genie&#39;s back was covered in the same runes that were covering the 
walls. The skin was red and puckered, looking like they had been carved 
yesterday.

Ami gagged. Tears sprang and fell, sliding over her cheeks and pooling 
under her chin. She squeezed her eyes shut, turning away so that Makoto, 
who had braved so much pain, wouldn&#39;t see them.

Warm and gentle hands cupped her cheeks, wiped away her tears. Ami 
sniffled and opened her eyes. Makoto had such a look of sorrow on her 
elegant face, as if the fact that Ami&#39;d been crying had caused her pain.

&quot;Please don&#39;t cry,&quot; the tawny haired genie pleaded. &quot;I don&#39;t like it 
when you cry.&quot;

Ami blinked. The brave exterior Makoto had once worn had melted. The 
playful mood had ended. Things were serious now.

&quot;No more crying.&quot; Makoto leaned closer.

&quot;If you&#39;re going to be my,&quot; she paused then spat out, &quot;Master, there&#39;s 
going to be no more tears.&quot;

Ami sighed and leaned into Makoto&#39;s hand. &quot;Alright.&quot;

The genie leaned forward until their forheads were touching. &quot;I mean 
it.&quot; The professer slowly shook her head, falling into the spell that 
Makoto&#39;s eye produced.

&quot;Okay,&quot; she breathed. Closer. Oh so close. The skin of their lips 
brushed. Hot electricity jolted their bodies and made their pulses race.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; Ami whispered dreamily as she began to close the 
distance...:::--::::

Sand.

Sand covered her body. Shifting again and again. An endless wave. 
Flesh-eating scarab beetles knew better than to disturb her. She was an 
ancient.

Buried in the sand.

Dead.

A jolt of energy seared through her body. A heartbeat echoed in her 
ears.

&#39;Air!&#39; she thought frantically as she clawed her way to the surface. 
&#39;Air! Air!&#39; It seemed like eons before her head thrust in way out of the 
sand. She gasped hoarsly, over and over, each gasp filling in the 
wrinkles on her skin, each gasp drawing precious air and energy into her 
system. She scrambled out and summoned her powers. A cobra answered her 
call. The snake glided across the sands, hissing gently and giving her 
permission to feast. With a savage growl, she grabbed the snake by its 
neck. Opened her mouth.

Inhaled its energy.

Bones strengthened and skin became smooth. Moccha colored.

She was free.

She was alive. She was needed. She was the One of Magicks.

She was Setsuna...:::--:::

Rumble.

Ami snapped out of the haze. &quot;What was that?&quot; she asked. Makoto huffed 
and let her head fall to Ami&#39;s shoulder.

&#39;So close!&#39; &quot;What was what?&quot;

The chamber shook beneath their feet, with such force it knocked them of 
balance. &quot;That!&quot; Ami grunted as she began to wobble unsteadily to her 
feet. Makoto gasped as a wave of dark energy coursed through her, 
leaving her cold and desprate. She gazed at the coffin.

It was shaking. The runes on its surface were glowing a violent red and 
shining brightly.

Makoto cursed savagly and ran to the far wall. &quot;Where is it?&quot; she 
hissed. She let out a cry of triumph as a stone sank in and the wall 
slid into the floor.

A gold sarcoghagus lay inside. It was also covered ancient writing, the 
symbols glowing a bright, white light. Makoto grabbed the coffin under 
her arm and Ami in the other. &quot;Hold on!&quot; she growled. With a rush of 
magic, she teleported them away.

And as the golden sarcoghagus left the temple that contained the black 
one, the temple crumbled.

Setsuna eagerly gulped down the pure water, nearly crying as the cool 
liquid slid down her throat.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; she croaked to the raven haired girl who had helped her. 
Hotaru smiled. &quot;You are very welcome my lady.&quot; The One of Magicks closed 
her eyes and hid tormented garnet eyes. How long had it been since she&#39;d 
been called that?

&quot;Hotaru, how is she doing?&quot; asked the aqua haired Michiru. Young Hotaru 
grinned and leaped to her feet. &quot;Mama, she talked!&quot; the girl giggled. 
&quot;She spoke to me! In the Old toungue too!&quot; Michiru smiled warmly and 
scooped the giggling child into her arms.

&quot;I hope she hasn&#39;t troubled you my lady.&quot; Michiru said.

&quot;She&#39;s been no trouble at all.&quot; Setsuna smiled. &quot;A child has smiled at 
me; the gods favor me do they not?&quot;

It was then that Haruka stormed into the tent. &quot;The temple has been 
demolished.&quot; The sandy haired Magi said roughly. &quot;And...she&#39;s awake.&quot;

Setsuna hung her head.

She wouldn&#39;t have been awakened if the Cursed One was still 
asleep...::::---::::::

Night fell over Egypt.

The ruins of the temple were silent in the moonlight.

Then, the rubble began to shift. A withered, decayed hand shot out of 
the debris, its skeletal fingers making disgusting popping noises as 
they flexed.

A figure crawled out of the rubble. Stood on its feet. Looked and the 
full moon. Threw its head back.

And howled.</pre>
