&#147;Don&#39;t go near her Galaxia&#133;&#148; the Time guardian growled, holding up her 
long staff to reinforce the words she&#146;d spoken so coldly, jealousy 
threaded in each word. Galaxia spared her barely a glance before 
throwing her long cloak off, revealing smooth plaited gold armor. In 
one smooth motion she dove into the small, but deep pond, closing her 
eyes to focus on her Princess&#146; energy. Maroon eyes flashed open in the 
murky waters as she located it, causing her to swim deeper until she 
saw a flash of gold. Winding her arms around the lithe form of 
Serenity, she pulled the other girl tight against her form before 
kicking her way to the surface, breaking water with her princess held 
tenderly in her arms. Swimming gracefully to shore, she dragged 
Serenity up onto the embankment, laying her on her back before 
checking her breathing.

Galaxia&#146;s breath came out in short gasps as she realized there was no 
stirring of air above the silver haired girl&#146;s cold lips. Leaning 
over, the golden warrior clasped her hands together before pressing 
her palms into Serenity&#146;s chest, pressing down in quick, sure motions. 
Checking the princess&#146; breathing again, she let out a frustrated growl 
before leaning over, covering Serenity&#146;s lips with her own as she&#146;d 
been longing to do only a short time before. After breathing into the 
girl&#146;s lunges a few times, Galaxia almost laughed with joy as the girl 
coughed and sputtered as she rolled to her side. Maroon eyes finally 
looked around, seeing no sign of the time guardian. A nervous skitter 
crawled up her spine before she shook it off, passing her 
concentration into rubbing Serenity&#146;s back comfortingly.

&#147;G-Galaxia&#133;&#148;

&#147;Shhhh Princess, you&#146;re weak from your ascension into power. You 
mustn&#146;t speak. I will take you back to the palace.&#148; The golden senshi 
murmured, throwing her thick cloak over the shivering girl before 
picking her up in her own quivering arms, heading for the crystal 
palace.

&#147;But-&#148;

&#147;Later my Lady&#133;I shall answer your desires later&#133;&#148; Galaxia murmured, a 
knowing look passing through her eyes as the double meaning slipped 
over the innocent princess&#146; head. She wasn&#146;t aware of the woman 
standing behind the hedges, watching them go with raging violet eyes 
and long waving crimson hair&#133;

Pluto waited patiently by the gates of the palace that led to the 
outer gardens, flanked by both the inner and outer court, Neptune and 
Uranus both healed well enough to fight, but still weak. Queen 
Serenity paced back and forth behind her, rubbing her temples, while a 
young man with dark ebony hair flanked by four similarly dressed 
generals tried to comfort her.

Wind started to blow softly, brushing the senshi&#146;s bangs from their 
faces as they closed their eyes, all seeming to be drawn to the 
powerful presence making itself known. Pluto stifled the urge to smile 
softly with the rest of the senshi, as she&#146;d used to do when she&#146;d 
felt her lover&#146;s aura. Instead, she raised her staff, preparing an 
attack, before Queen serenity placed a hand on her staff.

&#147;No Pluto&#133;she has my daughter&#133;&#148; the Queen whispered before running 
forward, followed closely by Endyimon and the inner court. As they 
reached the golden figure walking swiftly through the gardens, they 
saw Serenity, soaking wet, wrapped in a dark black cloak.

&#147;My darling!&#148; Queen Serenity cried, reaching forward for the bundle in 
Galaxia&#146;s arms, only to have it pulled away from her.

&#147;My queen. I can carry her on my own, the cloak is wet and so it would 
be too heavy for you-&#148; Galaxia started, feeling concern for her former 
queen rise in her soul. The warrior scowled as the Terran Prince 
Endyimon stepped forward, taking the princess from her grasp before 
pulling his sword from its sheath, pointing it at her throat. All 
concern vanished as anger creeped into her soul.

&#147;Stay away from my princess, monstrous senshi.&#148; The terran boy 
growled, backing away as the inners swarmed around him, pulling the 
cloak from the princess&#146; face as if they weren&#146;t sure it was her. Each 
sighed with relief as they saw small puffs of steam coming from the 
shivering form into the cold night air of the moon. Jupiter blinked in 
surprise as the princess was passed into her arms roughly; her strong 
arms clasping the princess tenderly as the Terran prince took two 
hands to his sword and waved it tauntingly at the Golden Senshi.

&#147;Endyimon!&#148; Queen serenity gasped, seeing an old flame enter the 
senshi&#146;s eyes as Galaxia reached slowly, almost unnoticeably, for her 
own famed sword. The Queen had never seen the prince in such a violent 
mood before, and she didn&#146;t like it. Doubts started in her mind about 
the coming wedding, before she violently squashed them. The terran 
queen had wanted her son to be wed to royalty, rather then the lady 
Beryl, and Serenity would be perfect for the boy.

&#147;What? Afraid to fight me, traitorous senshi?&#148; the prince taunted once 
again, giving a shocked gasp as in one smooth move, the golden senshi 
had drawn her sword and smashed it across the terran royal talisman. 
Endyimon stared in horror as the flashing gold blade sliced through 
his father&#146;s royal sword, shattering it into millions of little shards 
of gold crystal.

&#147;Galaxia!&#148;

The inner senshi jumped slightly as Serenity started to struggle to be 
free from Jupiter&#146;s hold. Shocked, Jupiter released the young 
princess, watching as the girl flung the cloak off before stumbling 
over to the golden warrior who stood at the end of Pluto&#146;s powered up 
staff.

Serenity flung her arms around Galaxia&#146;s neck, earning a shocked gasp 
her before the warm arms of the strongest senshi encircled the 
princess&#146; waist, keeping her from falling over.

Looking down at the girl in her arms, Galaxia threw an exasperated 
look at Pluto before turning to the Queen.

&#147;She&#146;s exhausted. Let me take her to her chambers.&#148; Galaxia ordered, 
only needing the Queen&#146;s small nod to walk past the angry terran 
prince, who was on his knees gathering what he could of the shattered 
sword as his generals simply avoided looking at anyone, their 
embarrassment in their prince evident. Galaxia barely spared the 
simmering Pluto a glance as she scooped her princess up in her arms, 
dashing off toward the large palace as the morning light broke 
horizon&#133;.
