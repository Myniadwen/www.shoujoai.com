<a href="../smoon/wfci-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Minako stared at Mitsuki in concern. &quot;Are you alright, sweetie? You 
know..we don&#39;t have to go.&quot; Mitsuki gave Minako a strained smile. &quot;I&#39;m 
alright..really.&quot; Rei sighed weakly. &quot;Well then everyone...let&#39;s go.&quot; 
She turned to Serenity, and for once, genuine concern was seen in her 
eyes. &quot;Listen..you don&#39;t have to go...you can go home.&quot; Serenity smiled 
at Rei. &quot;No way! I&#39;ve gotten this far..I won&#39;t be leaving.&quot; She grinned 
brightly. &quot;You can&#39;t get rid of &#39;Usagi&#39; now!&quot; Rei smiled sadly, and ran 
her fingers through her hair. 

&quot;Guess...I guess not. Well...everyone...time to go to Ni.&quot;

====================

Haruka was very angry. The time she had spent trying to find this girl 
was beginning to wear on her nerves. She shook her head, and stared at 
Michiru. &quot;Nobody..can find her. I&#39;m beginning to think she&#39;s ...hurt 
somewhere or something.&quot; Michiru&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Ruka...I&#39;m sure she&#39;s 
fine. You&#39;ll find her..I know you will.&quot; Haruka smiled and held Michiru 
close. &quot;Glad you believe in me..because I don&#39;t really believe in myself 
nowadays,&quot; she whispered.

====================

The shuttle, Firebird, was an elegantly designed piece of machinery. 
Serenity walked through the corridors of the large shuttle and looked 
around in awed-inspired fascination, like a small child. Rei smiled 
weakly. *She&#39;s really cute,* she thought, watching the silver-haired 
girl dart back and forth around the shuttle. Her gaze flitted over to 
Mitsuki, who, as she expected, was deep in thought. Rei thought of 
tapping the girl&#39;s shoulder, but then an idea came to her. &quot;Usagi,&quot; she 
whispered, causing the young girl to pull her gaze away from the window, 
&quot;come here.&quot; Serenity walked over to Rei and blinked. &quot;Yes?&quot; Rei tilted 
her head in the direction of Mitsuki. &quot;I&#39;ve got a job for you. Go cheer 
her up.&quot; Serenity beamed. &quot;Sure!&quot; She trotted over to Mitsuki, and Rei 
sighed. &quot;Man..&quot; she muttered, slipping into her own train of deep 
thought.

====================

Mitsuki frowned when Serenity walked over to her and sat down. &quot;Yes?&quot; 
she muttered a bit stiffly. Serenity smiled at her. &quot;You&#39;re having 
problems, no?&quot; Mitsuki sighed. &quot;Yes...I really don&#39;t want to go...but I 
have to. I..wouldn&#39;t be able to live with myself if I didn&#39;t.&quot; Serenity 
sighed, and looked down. &quot;Why do your parents hate you so much?&quot; Mitsuki 
winced. &quot;...Because Minako isn&#39;t the type of person they think I should 
be...with.&quot; Serenity sighed. &quot;Because she&#39;s a woman, right?&quot; she asked, 
sneaking a glance over at Rei. Mitsuki laughed. &quot;Oh...of course not! My 
people don&#39;t disapprove of same-sex relations. Mother and Father are 
angry because Minako isn&#39;t of upper-class.&quot; Serenity&#39;s eyes widened, and 
she noticed Mitsuki was lapsing into more..formal speech. &quot;That&#39;s why?&quot; 
she asked in baffled amazement. &quot;Yes,&quot; Mitsuki muttered, her eyes 
growing cold. She sighed. &quot;Nothing to be done about it though...you 
know, the err... &#39;dragon,&#39; has a crush on you.&quot; Serenity&#39;s eyes widened. 
&quot;Rei-san...? But..she doesn&#39;t even like me.&quot; Mitsuki laughed. &quot;She&#39;s 
acting the same way I acted when I met Minako..you just need to crack 
that rough exterior of hers.&quot; She leaned in close to Serenity, and 
whispered something that made the girl blush.

&quot;And Ni..it&#39;s a wonderful place to spark romance, hon.&quot;

Serenity blinked, and began to stammer. &quot;Um..I..I mean...I don&#39;t know 
about that.&quot; Mitsuki laughed. &quot;Just...um...talk to her, okay? I&#39;m going 
to go sit with Mina-chan. And..thanks for cheering me up.&quot; She left the 
room, and Serenity was alone once again..with Rei.

====================

Rei&#39;s eyes darted to the door when she heard Mitsuki leave. *Oh..no..* 
she thought, shuffling nervously in her chair. Serenity sat down next to 
Rei, and hummed a soft, long-forgotten tune. Rei frowned. &quot;What are you 
still doing here?&quot; she growled, shuffling a bit more. Serenity ignored 
her, and continued to hum. Rei&#39;s frowned deepened. &quot;Hey, did you hear 
me?&quot; Serenity stopped humming, and smiled at Rei. &quot;You know what? I 
honestly..don&#39;t know. I keep..keep hoping that something will happen,&quot; 
her voice hitched, &quot;and it never does. So..I should just leave...you&#39;re 
right...I should&#39;ve left.&quot; Rei&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Hey...wait...I didn&#39;t 
mean...&quot; Serenity shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s alright...I&#39;ll leave you alone 
now.&quot; She walked out slowly, glancing at Rei over her shoulder before 
the door whooshed behind her. Rei put her head in her hands.

&quot;Man...I am so stupid.&quot;

====================

Hotaru did not like the way her Setsuna-mama kept staring at her. It 
made her nervous. She knew that look; because it was the same look she 
would give people when she knew they were keeping something from her. As 
if to say, &quot;you&#39;re lying to me...&quot; Finally, Setsuna spoke. &quot;Hotaru...are 
you sure those three girls were not there? Your eyes have always been 
better than mine, dear.&quot; Hotaru smiled at her. &quot;I&#39;m sure Setsuna-mama.&quot; 
Setsuna sighed weakly, as if she was disappointed. &quot;Very well Hotaru...&quot; 
she said, turning her back on the girl. Hotaru shuffled a bit. &quot;I&#39;m sure 
we&#39;ll find them, Setsuna-mama.&quot; Setsuna started to chuckle softly. 
&quot;They&#39;ve escaped. You see, Hotaru...the girls were in that room...when I 
asked you to look, I was simply testing you. And now I see...you&#39;ve lied 
to me Hotaru.&quot; Hotaru&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;No..no, Setsuna-mama! I had 
to...I didn&#39;t want to lie, but I knew that Endymion wouldn&#39;t be nice to 
her if we brought her back! And..and I didn&#39;t want Rei-chan and the 
others to be hurt!&quot; Setsuna turned to her, her crimson eyes glazed over 
in pain. &quot;And your loyalty to them meant that much...that you would 
disobey me?&quot; Hotaru looked down, her eyes brimming with tears. &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry, Setsuna-mama,&quot; she whispered softly. Setsuna sighed. &quot;Perhaps..we 
can help them...bring the girl home and explain everything...we&#39;ll use 
the cop..and the thief.&quot; Hotaru smiled. &quot;Really? Haruka-san and 
Michiru-san?&quot; Setsuna smiled. &quot;Of course...and I know where they are 
headed....they are headed for Ni...Lady Mitsuki&#39;s home...&quot;

====================


Ni. They were here. The Citadel of Hope, Mitsuki had explained, was a 
nickname for the planet. And it was beautiful. Towers, 
buildings...glorious architecture...even the people were beautiful, they 
all seemed to be smiling...and it *was* romantic, Serenity realized with 
a smile. Mitsuki, however, did not seem pleased. Her jaw was taut, and 
she walked stiffly, holding on to Minako&#39;s hand. After she had explained 
a few basic things about Ni, she had fallen mute, skillfully moving 
among the bustling crowds, grasping on to Minako&#39;s hand as if she was an 
anchor. And then, suddenly, she stopped, causing the others to run into 
her.

&quot;We&#39;re here....where my parents live...&quot;

Rei and the others had never met Mitsuki&#39;s parents, so they were 
surprised when a very regal looking woman answered the door. She looked 
to be in her late forties, and Rei noticed that she and Mitsuki shared 
some of the same features. The woman&#39;s blue-gray eyes darted over to 
Mitsuki, who lowered her head slightly. The woman shook her head. &quot;My 
God, girl...what have you brought this time?&quot; Mitsuki sighed. 
&quot;Mother...these are my friends...&quot; The woman sighed, and ran her fingers 
through her white hair. &quot;And what, may I ask, are you doing here with 
them..and..&quot; she waved her hand over to Minako, &quot;her.&quot; Mitsuki shuffled 
a bit, and seemed at a loss for words.

So Serenity spoke for her.

&quot;Ma&#39;am..my name is Usagi, and I&#39;d like to say that the way you treat 
your daughter is entirely unacceptable. I don&#39;t mean to be rude 
but..didn&#39;t you raise her? And I&#39;m sure you love her, so why would you 
treat your own flesh and blood like this?&quot; Mitsuki winced. 
&quot;Usagi...please,&quot; she pleaded, sneaking a glance at her mother, whose 
face had grown taut. But Serenity continued. &quot;And also ma&#39;am, I think 
that you should just get used to the fact that Minako and Mitsuki are 
going to be together.&quot; She shuffled a bit, and hid behind Makoto. &quot;And 
that&#39;s it.&quot; Mitsuki&#39;s mother sighed. &quot;....I suppose you all should come 
in. Mitsuki, you know where the guest rooms are..um...and it&#39;s 
a..pleasure to meet you all,&quot; she extended her hand to Serenity, &quot;Miss 
Usagi, my name is Naomi Niade, and I am the General of Ni&#39;s armies.&quot; Rei 
turned to Mitsuki. &quot;Wha? I thought your father was the general.&quot; Naomi 
laughed. &quot;Oh...my...you thought...ha! My husband? He can&#39;t even wield a 
sword! Now come in girls, come in. You all have Usagi to thank for this 
one. It will take some...time, but I think we can work something out.&quot; 
Rei smiled at Serenity, but the girl did not return it. Rei sighed. 
*She&#39;s still mad at me...* Naomi turned to the group, and her gaze 
hardened suddenly. &quot;And another thing girls...no funny business. If I 
find you&#39;ve been lying to me, you will be punished. Is that understood?&quot;

The girls nodded. &quot;Yes ma&#39;am...&quot;
