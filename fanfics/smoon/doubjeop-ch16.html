Lita, still holding onto Ami&#39;s arm with an iron grip, opened a steel 
door leading to a small chemical lab further down the hall way. Then, 
with a roar of frustration and anger, she practically threw Ami into the 
room. The momentum was strong enough to send Ami crashing on top of a 
table, sending various bits of lab equipment crashing to the floor.

Not giving her companion time to recover, Lita slammed the door shut and 
walked over to Ami. Since Ami hadn&#39;t had time to recover her balance or 
turn around, Lita grabbed her shoulders, jerked her to a standing 
position, then violently twisted her around to face her.

Sounding strangely calm, Lita said, &quot;Let&#39;s see now. First, you ignore me 
for an entire evening to do some research on a project you have 
perfected to the point of insanity. Next, you get lost trying to find 
your way to the construction zone you were supposed to be supervising 
today. Now, I find you breaking into a locker that only you have the 
keys to. Care to explain your rather odd behavior?&quot;

By this time, Ami had regained her balance and oriented herself. She 
decided to gamble again, this time by doing exactly what she thought Amy 
would do in a situation like this.

The sharp slap came as a complete surprise to Lita. She stumbled back a 
step and rubbed her cheek gently for a moment as a red hand print 
started to form there.

She blinked a few times to clear her head, then she looked down at Ami 
with a smile that had no humor in it and said, &quot;Oooooh, you are good 
aren&#39;t you.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question. As her face turned red, both from the 
slap and from ever-increasing anger, Lita grabbed Ami by the collar and 
lifted her off the ground. Then she threw Ami against the door and 
watched with some satisfaction as the woman&#39;s small frame slid to the 
ground.

Despite her anger, Lita&#39;s voice had an almost amused sound to it. &quot;Let&#39;s 
get to the bottom of this, shall we?&quot; Not bothering to help Ami up this 
time, she said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you try transforming, &#39;Amy&#39;?&quot;

Without turning around, Ami put her hand on the door knob. She wasn&#39;t 
about to try to open the door and run, because she knew Lita could 
easily outrun her. Still, it was tempting.

&#39;She knows,&#39; Ami thought to herself. Serena had told her not to 
transform because her powers would give her away. But she had said the 
drug she had given her might help her to blend in. At this point, even 
if it didn&#39;t, being transformed into Sailor Mercury might at least give 
her a fighting chance of escaping. Besides, what other choice did she 
have at the moment?

&quot;Mercury Crystal Power, Make-Up!&quot;

Ami shouted the familiar transformation phrase, the militaristic uniform 
she had been wearing vanished, and in its place was her Senshi uniform. 
Or rather, Dark Mercury&#39;s uniform. Ami looked down at her outfit, 
surprised by the sight of the black Sekkou uniform even if it had been 
what she expected.

Trying not to let that surprise show, she looked up at Lita and said 
angrily, &quot;Satisfied?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am, Ami.&quot; With another yell of anger, Lita stepped forward and 
sent a kick flying in Ami&#39;s direction. It missed, but it took Ami until 
after she jumped away from the door to realize that that was exactly 
what Lita was trying to get her to do. &quot;Such a good performance. If only 
Serena had the brains to tell you the proper transformation phrase, you 
might have been able to keep me guessing.&quot;

&quot;Dark Jupiter Power, Make-Up!&quot;

With those words, Lita went through her version of her transformation. 
Unlike Ami&#39;s, Lita&#39;s resembled Makoto&#39;s transformation, only with black 
energy instead of the blue lightning that accompanied Makoto&#39;s.

Then Dark Sailor Jupiter looked Sailor Mercury up and down for a moment 
as if she were appraising a purchase at the store. &quot;Amazing. You look 
just like her. Serena must have given you some of her medication. That&#39;s 
the only explanation I have. How she convinced you to take that stuff 
I&#39;ll never know.&quot;

Lita looked into Ami&#39;s eyes and her expression softened from anger to 
one of longing for a moment. In that moment, Ami saw the love for her 
partner that Lita had buried within the swirling madness of her mind. 
Lita raised her hand slowly to touch Ami&#39;s chin absently as she thought 
out loud. &quot;You have everything you had within you when I fell in love 
with . . .&quot; Lita&#39;s words trailed off for a moment as her fingers 
delicately touched Ami&#39;s jaw.

That simple touch seemed to bring her back to what qualified as 
&#39;reality&#39; for the Sekkou. Anger flashed in her eyes again, and she 
quickly brought up her hands to press them to each side of Ami&#39;s head. 
Then, as Ami yelled out in pain from the pressure, Lita lifted her off 
the ground. While her words were quiet, the rage behind them was obvious 
to Ami. &quot;If anything happens to her, I promise you, you won&#39;t live to 
see another sunrise.&quot;

Still holding Ami, Lita turned and dropped her on top of some of the 
overturned lab equipment. As she watched Ami land on the ground, rubbing 
her neck in pain, Lita said quietly, &quot;Now, the question is, what do I do 
with you?&quot; She smiled as she started to talk out loud. &quot;It might be 
amusing to bring you to Queen Beryl and see what her reaction is. That&#39;s 
exactly what I would do, too, except she would be just as pissed to see 
you as she would be at us for letting you get this close to her.&quot;

As Lita continued to rattle off a few other morbid ideas on the topic of 
fun things to do to Ami that would cause her extreme amounts of pain, 
Ami looked around her at the various lab equipment on the floor. Several 
shattered glass tubes, a few medication cups, some empty syringes, 
rubber gloves . . . nothing particularly useful as a weapon.

Then her eyes fell on an object lying on the floor just within reach. An 
unassuming tool, about a foot long, rectangular in shape with a simple 
lever handle. A pill crusher. Made almost entirely out of steel. Ami 
gripped the handle just as Lita grabbed her and hauled her to her feet.

Ami saw energy start to crackle around Lita&#39;s hands and decided now was 
the time to act. Before Lita could send electricity shooting through 
her, Aim swung the pill crusher and let it go at just the right moment 
so that it would fly right into the side of Lita&#39;s head. There was a 
loud cracking sound, and at first, Lita didn&#39;t do anything. She just 
looked at Ami with a surprised expression. Then the energy she was 
building up dissipated suddenly, and she dropped Ami as she crumpled to 
the floor with a thud.


Ami backed up cautiously for a moment. When Lita didn&#39;t move, she moved 
closer and knelt down. For some strange reason, she felt a little guilty 
that she might have inflicted serious injury upon Lita. As she gently 
shook her, Ami asked nervously, &quot;Are you really knocked out?&quot;

She nearly jumped out of her skin when Lita started to moving to get up 
again, saying sheepishly, and a little groggy from the blow, &quot;Yeah, . . 
. no. Ya can&#39;t blame me for --!&quot;

Another loud crack rang out as Ami grabbed the pill crusher and in a 
panic once again smashed it down on the back of Lita&#39;s skull as hard as 
she could, similar to a person in a panic about the bug they just 
crushed not being dead.

The bluenette tapped Lita with her foot a few more times, trying to make 
certain the woman was really out this time. Ami slowly opened the door, 
never taking her eyes off of Lita. Then just before she left she said, 
&quot;I am sorry, but it is really for the best. For what it is worth, by the 
time you come to, I should have your wife back to you.&quot; Then she locked 
the door and closed it behind her. It was time to leave.

----------

Haruka&#39;s rather smug voice said over the telephone to Minako, &quot;Ya know, 
they say not to hit someone with a closed fist, but sometimes, it sure 
is fun!&quot;

Minako shook her head. As the leader of the Senshi, she felt it was her 
job to be the responsible one. However, she knew the smile she couldn&#39;t 
keep back would betray her true feelings on the matter even over the 
phone, as she said, &quot;You know you didn&#39;t have to hit her, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah. I&#39;m such a bad girl. Well, anyway, I figured I&#39;d let 
you know she is on her way home. She should be back any --&quot;

The end of Haruka&#39;s sentence was cut short by the sound of the front 
door to the apartment being thrown open, causing Minako to nearly drop 
the phone in surprise as the topic of conversation came storming into 
the room. Amy didn&#39;t even bother to close the door to the apartment as 
she hurried past while covering her right eye with her hand as she 
grumbled in frustration and anger to herself. Minako watched the woman 
until she got to her room and slammed the door shut.

&quot;Ah, there is our little princess now,&quot; Haruka said, trying somewhat 
unsuccessfully not to laugh.

Minako sighed and replied, &quot;It&#39;s easy for you to say. I have to sleep 
here, you know? Guess I&#39;ll find the first aid kit and go talk to her. 
Goodnight, Haruka.&quot;

A few minutes later, Minako was standing outside of Ami&#39;s bedroom with 
the first aid kit, unsure if she was supposed to knock, just walk in, or 
wait for Amy to make the first move and ask for help. She could hear the 
Sekkou rummaging around the room looking for something. Just as Minako 
made up her mind and was about to knock, the door opened about half an 
inch and Amy&#39;s left eye came into view. To Minako she looked for all the 
world like a small, scared, angry animal looking through a hole in the 
wall at something that had come to eat her. The expression made her feel 
sorry for Amy. Just a little.

After a few moments, Amy&#39;s voice asked in a strangely soft, embarrassed 
voice, &quot;What do you want?&quot;

Minako couldn&#39;t believe it. Was Amy actually . . . crying? &quot;I . . . was 
told you had a . . . rough time today after school, so I brought the 
first aid kit. Figured I&#39;d help patch you up.&quot;

There was a moment of uncomfortable silence while Amy thought about 
whether she wanted help or not. &quot;I&#39;ll only let you come in under one 
condition.&quot;

Minako smiled happily. Even if Amy was the enemy, she always did get a 
strange thrill out of helping people who were sick or injured, despite 
their complaints. &quot;Sure! Anything!&quot;

Amy sounded dead serious when she said, &quot;Don&#39;t flip out. This is 
embarrassing enough for me as it is. Oh, and while you are out there, 
you wouldn&#39;t happen to know where the toolbox is, would you?&quot;

Minako blinked in confusion and then asked dumbly, to make sure she 
heard right, &quot;Tool box?&quot;

The eye disappeared out of view for a moment and a sound of something, 
possibly Amy&#39;s forehead, banging against the other side of the door 
could be heard. Between thuds, Ami said, &quot;Yes, the toolbox.&quot;

After going to get the toolbox from under the kitchen sink, Minako 
returned to find the door opened halfway. Taking it as an invitation to 
enter, she saw Amy sitting in the chair at the desk, turned away from 
the door.

After another long, awkward silence, Amy said simply, &quot;Flathead 
screwdriver please. Smallest one you have, preferably.&quot;

As Minako rummaged through the box, she asked in an attempt to make 
small talk, &quot;Are you having problems with a clock or something? I mean, 
a toolbox is a rather strange thing to ask for to help heal a punch in 
the face.&quot;

Amy said nothing. Instead, she swiveled the chair around so she was 
facing Minako.

The blonde just stared at her dumbly then said, &quot;O.K. . . . uh, 
screwdriver it is then.&quot;

While she had stopped crying, her cheeks still had a reddish tinge to 
them, giving away that the devil had indeed, been crying. That wasn&#39;t 
what had gotten Minako&#39;s attention, though. Instead of the usual purple 
bruising and swollen eye Minako had expected to see, Amy&#39;s entire right 
eye, including the eyelids, had been pushed in and to the left, leaving 
an opening where exposed wiring was clearly visible.

Amy reached out and took the screwdriver from Minako without a word, and 
pushed at an area near her eyebrow until all of the skin on the upper 
right area of her face came loose. A quiet sucking sound was heard as 
Amy reached up and pulled off the artificial skin from her face, 
revealing the entire eye assembly, and what looked like tan plastic put 
in place to replace bone and cover electronic parts.

The plastic casing was cracked, but intact. At the edge of the casing, 
Minako could see white bone right before where what she assumed was 
Amy&#39;s real skin started. And the structure that made up the eye 
consisted of the lens and eyelids, with a mass of wiring, tiny 
hydraulics, and servos. Several of the hydraulics seemed to have been 
knocked loose, and the artificial eye hung outward a bit after Amy 
removed the skin, allowing Minako to somewhat be able to see farther 
inside Amy&#39;s head. While Minako didn&#39;t know all that much about human 
anatomy other than the basics, it looked like the cybernetic work was 
possibly intertwined all the way to her brain.

Amy flopped the synthetic skin onto the desk behind her, and started 
assessing the damage with her hand for a moment. She sighed in 
frustration, then asked, &quot;Mirror?&quot;

Minako, still staring at the strange site before her, said, &quot;Wha --? Oh, 
yeah.&quot; She opened a drawer on Ami&#39;s dresser and held it up so Amy could 
see herself.

As she watched Amy quietly start fitting parts back together, an obvious 
question came to mind. At first, Minako felt it was a rather rude 
question to ask, but after a while she felt the silence and her 
curiosity getting to her. &quot;So uh, . . . for the sake of conversation, I 
was wondering something. What . . . um . . . what happened to you 
anyway? Was it a car accident or something?&quot;

At that question, Amy froze for a few seconds. Amy&#39;s expression changed 
to one of annoyance, then Minako could see a faint green light, just 
barely bright enough to be visible, flashing underneath the plastic 
casing. It took her another instant to realize Amy was thinking of a 
reply.

Amy lifted the pliers out of the tool box. She looked at them 
quizzically, then said, &quot;Such primitive tools. I guess they&#39;ll have to 
do for now, though.&quot; She gave her mechanical eye a gentle tug, the 
pushed it somewhat back into place and set about pushing the tiny 
hydraulics back together.

The blond frowned slightly and said, &quot;Sorry. I suppose that&#39;s a touchy 
subject.&quot;

&quot;Not really. It&#39;s just a . . . a strange question, coming from you. You 
sure you want to know the answer to that?&quot;

Minako nodded her head, and Amy continued. &quot;A few years ago, I 
challenged Mina for control over the Sekkou, since she seemed to me to 
be a poor choice of a leader. Our Queen found the confrontation to be 
amusing, and had us fight it out to finalize the answer, and of course, 
for her own entertainment. I failed to calculate why it was a ditsy 
blonde should outrank me.&quot;

Minako started to apologize again for asking, but Amy held up a hand and 
said, &quot;But wait! You haven&#39;t heard the best part.&quot; Once she was sure her 
audience would not interrupt her again, Amy continued, &quot;It was a moment 
of indecisiveness. I had an opportunity to take her out, but I wasn&#39;t 
sure if it would work, so I held off my attack for a split second. Lack 
of confidence, I suppose. It was all the time she needed.&quot;

Suddenly Amy slammed her left hand down on the desk as hard as she 
could, causing Minako to jump a bit. &quot;WHACK! Just like that, I had a 
quarter of my skull, along with my right eye, and part of my brain 
removed by that damn whip.&quot; Amy froze a moment, then looked at her left 
hand in thought. &quot;Since I had just long enough to see the attack coming, 
I foolishly raised my hand to block it.&quot; Wiggling her fingers for 
emphasis, she said, &quot;The hand&#39;s fake too. I suppose in the heat of 
battle, she felt it necessary to break my left arm, and right leg just 
for good measure right after that. Can&#39;t say for sure though, since I 
was already out of it by that point.&quot;

Minako thought another moment then said, &quot;Why didn&#39;t all that show up on 
Ami&#39;s scan?&quot;

Amy shrugged and said, &quot;Just a hypothesis, but it might be the 
biomechanical parts showed up close enough to the real thing to fool 
her. Of course, she could also have just been being polite, since she 
could probably tell that none of my cybernetic parts are enhancements. 
The world may never know!&quot; Amy finished making the last adjustments, 
then gently fitted the synthetic skin back into place with a disturbing 
squishing sound.

Then Amy smiled said, &quot;Since you don&#39;t mind asking me so many personal 
questions, and I have given you honest answers, how&#39;s about I ask you 
one to make it even.&quot;

&quot;Um, all right, I guess . . .&quot;

Amy&#39;s smile had a slightly morbid look to it as she asked, &quot;How does it 
feel knowing you have that kind of darkness lurking in your soul?&quot;

Minako got defensive at the question. The very notion that she had it in 
her to do something like that couldn&#39;t be true. &quot;I&#39;d never hurt Ami like 
that, even if she walked up to me and seriously threatened my life, let 
alone questioned my place. It&#39;s absurd to even think it.&quot;

Amy&#39;s smile got wider as she said, &quot;You know, every person has a dark 
side. It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. After all, even your beloved 
Ami-chan would tell you there is no such thing as negative emotions. 
That part of them that makes you just want to hurt someone when they 
offend you in some way. That part of you that knows that you are right, 
and the rest of the world is wrong. That part that knows you are better 
than everyone else. If I could take what you would would call that moral 
barrier that keeps you from acting on it, why, I bet you would be up to 
all sorts of things! Bet you would even start trying to take me apart 
right now, just for suggesting it.&quot; She folded her arms across her 
chest, nodded, and smiled as if that were the end of the conversation 
and she had won.

&#39;Egotistical little thing, aren&#39;t you?&#39; was Minako&#39;s thought. Amy wasn&#39;t 
the only one who could play mind games, though. Minako did something 
that Amy didn&#39;t expect. She sat back, and smiled. Minako thought to 
herself, &#39;You wanna play? All right, let&#39;s play.&#39;

She asked simply, &quot;How about I answer that, by asking you a question. 
How does it feel knowing you are missing that? That you don&#39;t have much 
control over your own mind, and that you are missing a part of your 
spirit. Must be awful.&quot;

Amy&#39;s smile vanished instantly, replaced by a look of sadness. &quot;It&#39;s . . 
. sad. When you lose the ability to control your life, and can&#39;t 
directly question those who command you . . . well . . . you can live, 
but it isn&#39;t really your life.&quot; Then she started laughing and said, 
&quot;This is silly of me. Why the hell am I telling you any of --&quot; She 
stopped talking when she felt a hand on her shoulder.

Minako was now standing beside her and said, &quot;You know it doesn&#39;t have 
to be this way. We can help you. All you have to do is tell us why you 
are fighting us. Then we can --&quot;

Amy stood up, pushed Minako away angrily and said, &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;

The blonde stepped in front of her and replied, &quot;What do you mean, &#39;you 
can&#39;t!&#39;? You&#39;ve told me this much already! Why not just tell me a little 
more?&quot;

Amy sighed and sat back down. &quot;You don&#39;t understand. I literally can&#39;t 
tell you. That little part of my mind that&#39;s missing? That part that&#39;s 
missing in all of the Sekkou? It makes us slaves to . . . someone else&#39;s 
will. We have thoughts of our own, but we don&#39;t have a . . . filter to 
sort them out or control them or the emotions that come with them. And, 
we can&#39;t directly act against our master.&quot; A grim look of determination 
replaced the look of self-pity as she finished, &quot;But, we can indirectly 
make a challenge, and challenge that authority, we will.&quot;

Amy sat quietly for several minutes thinking to herself. She would never 
admit it to Minako, but for some reason, she couldn&#39;t help but respect 
her, even if she was her enemy. She was willing to listen, after all . . 
.

In a flash of inspiration, another thought came to Amy. A &#39;plan B&#39; 
scenario she could start putting in place should the Sekkou&#39;s true goal 
become compromised. It was risky, but it would only require a short trip 
to get it in motion. It wouldn&#39;t be much, just the equivalent of setting 
up a chess board. But for now it would do. She stood up suddenly and 
started heading for the door.

Minako followed her out of the room and said, &quot;Where are you going?&quot;

Amy looked over her shoulder and answered,&quot;Talking to you has inspired 
me to do something for you in return. Call it a . . . random act of 
kindness. Just because I am missing a chunk of my spirit does not mean I 
can&#39;t do something nice. Besides, It&#39;s better than sitting around here 
playing twenty questions with you. I can&#39;t tell you what it is though, 
because . . . well, it&#39;s a surprise! Why don&#39;t we go and have a quick 
talk with Makoto to get our minds off of such difficult conversation?&quot;

Minako followed the Sekkou out of the apartment, saying, &quot;You reveal 
crazy sci-fi eye sockets to me and now you&#39;re going to surprise me? Oh, 
this should be good.&quot;

----------

Ami typed in a few more commands on a computer terminal and nodded in 
satisfaction when she heard the main power turn on. She only had a few 
more things left to do before the portal was fully activated. Then she 
would have to pray that Amy got near a reflective surface before the 
Sekkou found her.

She walked over and flipped a few switches as she finished activating 
the matter/anti-matter containment field as she thought about her time 
on this side of the portal. Her only regret was that she hadn&#39;t had the 
time to figure out what had happened to change things so drastically 
between worlds. Obviously, Beryl had something to do with it, but what?

Ami started walking up the stairs toward the portal. All she had left 
was literally to hit the power button, and pray that no one found her 
before she left.

She got to the top of the stairs, and was just about to type in the 
activation command when something slammed down on top of her, knocking 
her on her back, sending a loud clang through the room. Luckily, Serena 
wasn&#39;t nearly as graceful at flight as the rest of the Sekkou, and fared 
much worse than Ami. There was a series of loud crashing and clanging 
sounds as Serena crashed into the landing behind Ami, and then wound up 
rolling down the stairs, coming to a halt on the same landing where Ami 
had broken her arm. Ami quickly stood up and was just about to try 
again, but Serena recovered quickly and was able to land behind Ami, 
grab her arms, and pull her away.

The angry Sekkou yelled out, &quot;What the hell are you doing? I said you 
are supposed to stay here!&quot; Serena stepped back, frantically trying to 
keep Ami from completing the activation process.

Ami felt panic and anger rise up in her. If she didn&#39;t get out of here 
soon, it was only a matter of time before she got herself killed. Along 
with that was the thought she shouted out loud. &quot;I am sick of everyone 
smacking me around!&quot;

Ami kicked frantically for a moment, trying to get away. She realized 
Serena was trying to pull her back down the stairs. It was now or never.

Ami, still struggling to get free, shifted her weight back just as she 
estimated Serena was standing on the first step, causing them both to 
start to fall. She felt Serena&#39;s grip loosen as she started to try to 
regain her balance. Ami pushed back at the Sekkou with her hands as hard 
as she could, giving herself just enough momentum to fall forward, 
sending Serena crashing down the stairs again. She didn&#39;t even look back 
to see what had happened to Serena. She didn&#39;t care. All she wanted to 
do was leave. Get back to Makoto, get back to her life, and get the hell 
out of here.

Her finger once again stopped when she heard Serena&#39;s weak voice from 
below plead, &quot;Please . . . don&#39;t go. We . . . need your . . . help.&quot;

All she had to do was push the button and walk through the portal, but 
Ami just couldn&#39;t do it. Something her mother had drilled into her at a 
young age was, no matter what, you never ignore a cry for help. She 
sighed quietly, then walked back to the stairs and looked down.

Serena staggered to her feet, clutching her side, saying, &quot;Just listen 
to what I have to say, then you can leave. I just . . . if you are 
anything like Amy used to be, then maybe . . . maybe you can think of a 
way to help.&quot;

Ami nodded. It was a simple enough request.

Serena allowed herself to sink back down to the ground slowly, resting 
her back against the wall, then said, &quot;You see, everything that has 
happened here is my fault. It seems like so long ago now.&quot;

&quot;It was during our last fight with Beryl. Everyone . . . all of my 
friends, and Darien had died. It was just me and Beryl, preparing to 
fight it out to the end.&quot; Serena sighed sadly, and added, &quot;It was all 
too much.&quot;

Serena looked up at Ami. Even from where she stood, Ami could see the 
guilt in her eyes. &quot;Beryl stood before me, prepared to destroy all that 
existed to get revenge on us. If I failed, everyone on the planet would 
have been killed. If I succeeded, all of my friends would have died for 
a cause no one would have known about. I . . . couldn&#39;t live with either 
of those choices, so I chose a different one. I made Beryl a deal.&quot;

Ami nodded and said, &quot;What kind of a deal?&quot; Usagi never talked about the 
fight with Beryl. It was just one of those things Ami felt was best not 
to ask about, since she figured it must have been hard on Usagi. Though, 
she had never thought about what must have been going through her mind 
at the time. Perhaps what happened here was one of the things she had 
been thinking about.

Serena couldn&#39;t keep eye contact with Ami while she told her story. &quot;I 
told her that I could force Metaria from her body and destroy her. Then, 
I wanted her to bring back my friends. I told her if she did, I would 
give Beryl the Ginzuishou and . . . allow her to control the earth 
without interference from us. I remember saying, &#39;Think about it. Why 
destroy the world when you can rule it for yourself?&#39;&quot;

&quot;She made one request -- that we were to serve her as replacements for 
her lost Shitennou. The price of failure and the price of success in my 
mind were both too great, so I . . .&quot;

Ami looked down at her own hands, which she hadn&#39;t noticed she had been 
gripping the railing with until now. She said quietly, &quot;So, that&#39;s why 
you are different from the others.&quot;

Serena nodded. The simple gesture reminded Ami so much of Usagi that for 
a moment, she forgot who she was talking to. &quot;That&#39;s right. Beryl 
brought them back, just like she promised. But they were different. They 
seemed to lack remorse. The kindness they all had was gone. She . . . 
took away part of their souls. I, on the other hand, was normal Sailor 
Moon. Beryl still saw me as a threat, so she had Ami create the 
medication which runs through your veins. It helps me to be somewhat 
like the Sekkou, and binds me to the same rules as them. I was surprised 
Beryl didn&#39;t kill me at first. Then I realized she enjoyed watching me 
suffer with the knowledge that I handed my friends over to the devil. We 
can&#39;t defy Beryl, but perhaps you can.&quot;

Ami had just one question while Serena was being so talkative. One that 
would help avoid any unnecessary surprises in the future. &quot;Where is Mamo 
. . .I mean, Darien?&quot;

Serena said nothing. She didn&#39;t have to. The tears running down her 
cheeks said it louder than any words could have.

Ami nodded slowly. &quot;I see.&quot; She looked down at the broken Sekkou and 
couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for her.

----------

About that same moment, Makoto was busy moving furniture around her 
living room.

She hadn&#39;t reorganized the living room since her and Ami&#39;s date only two 
days ago. She had started this particular project to get her mind off of 
Ami for a while, but every time she moved something, she couldn&#39;t help 
think about that evening.

The latest object in the room to have her frustration wrought upon it 
was an end table. Makoto set it next to the couch and stepped back. That 
simple action got her thinking about events that had taken place on that 
same couch the last time Ami was over.

Ami, the one who had been through so much since this insanity started. 
Ami, the one who had made her life feel complete for the first time in 
ages. Ami, the one who shouldn&#39;t even have been involved in the fight at 
the mall. Ami, the one who . . .

With a frustrated yell, Makoto gave the end table a violent kick, 
sending it toppling over. She hadn&#39;t realized how angry she was until 
she spoke. &quot;The one who isn&#39;t here!&quot;

&quot;Is now a bad time?&quot;

Makoto looked toward the apartment door, but saw that it was closed. She 
could have sworn she had just heard &#39;the one&#39; speak.

Sighing in frustration, Makoto flopped back on the couch and leaned her 
head back with her eyes closed. After a few moments, she whispered, &quot;Now 
I&#39;m even hearing you in my head.&quot; A small smile formed on her face as 
she said, &quot;I&#39;ve got it bad. But I suppose the voices in my head won&#39;t 
tell anyone.&quot;

&quot;Us voices hereby promise to keep our secrets.&quot;

Green eyes flew open and looked up at a pair of beautiful familiar blue 
ones.

Makoto tilted her head to the side and let her smile grow larger. It was 
funny seeing Ami looking at her upside down since the other was leaning 
over from the back side of the couch to look into her eyes. Makoto 
raised her hands to gently hold Ami&#39;s face. Gently drawing her love 
closer to her she whispered, &quot;Is it really you?&quot;

Ami suddenly got an evil smile on her face as she whispered back 
huskily, &quot;Close enough.&quot;

Amy moved just in time to avoid the punch Makoto sent flying at her 
face. The sudden movement combined with Amy stepping back caused the 
couch to nearly topple over. Makoto was on her feet in seconds to face 
her opponent. With tears fighting to leave her eyes, Makoto nearly 
screamed, &quot;What the hell are you doing in here?&quot; Then, without waiting 
for a response, she yelled, &quot;Stop playing games with me! Get the hell 
out right now!&quot;

Amy laughed, sounding indeed like it was a game. Acting as if Makoto 
couldn&#39;t kill her with one blow, she moved closer and stood the end 
table back up as she said, &quot;Now now, that&#39;s no way to greet a friend, is 
it?&quot;

Makoto pointed at the door and said, &quot;You&#39;re no friend. Why aren&#39;t you 
leaving?&quot;

&quot;Because I am not breaking any of the rules you people set for me,&quot; Ami 
said, still sounding rather amused.

&quot;Like hell you&#39;re not! Where is your escort?&quot;

&quot;Probably huffing and puffing her way up the stairs still, since the 
elevator is out of order.&quot;

Her green eyes narrowed angrily as Makoto asked, &quot;Then how did you get 
up here?&quot;

Makoto didn&#39;t realize it was possible for anyone to smile as big as Amy 
did when she answered, &quot;I didn&#39;t fly, if that&#39;s what you are wondering. 
I walked. I used my ability to defy gravity and walked up the side of 
the building. Don&#39;t worry, no one saw me. You would be surprised how 
rarely people look straight up.&quot;

Noticing the opened glass doors leading out to the balcony, the brunette 
walked over and closed them, trying to keep her calm. &quot;As soon as Minako 
gets here, you are leaving. Understood?&quot;

&quot;Actually, it&#39;s Minako I want to discuss with you.&quot;

Absently, Amy picked up a picture of Makoto and Ami then sighed. It was 
the very same picture of Makoto feeding Ami some chicken with chopsticks 
that Makoto had been admiring before her last date with Ami. The Sekkou 
looked suddenly lost in sad, longing thought.

Makoto&#39;s expression softened just a fraction, as she thought, &#39;You don&#39;t 
show it much but . . .&#39; Then finishing her thought out loud she said, 
&quot;You miss her too.&quot;

The expression on Amy&#39;s face for a split second after she had spoken 
reminded Makoto just how much the Senshi and Sekkou of Mercury had in 
common. Just like that though, the evil blue devil snapped the picture 
back down angrily.

Then she plastered a fake smile on her face and asked, &quot;Where was I? Oh, 
yes. I have a favor to ask of you. You see, Mi--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to do you any favors. I don&#39;t owe you a damn thing. Shut 
up, sit down, and wait for Minako to get here so she can get rid of 
you.&quot; Glaring at the door in frustration, Makoto huffed out, &quot;Where is 
she anyway?&quot;

Rolling her eyes and ignoring Makoto&#39;s instructions, Amy started over. 
&quot;You see, Minako has shown me some kindness. I just figured before all 
of your unavoidable deaths at the Sekkou&#39;s hands, I would offer you a 
chance to repay the favor for me.&quot;

&quot;Oh please. We have dealt with more powerful beings than the likes of 
Amy Mizuno --

Amy interrupted to correct Makoto, &quot;Anderson.&quot;

&quot;Whatever! You&#39;re the ones who are going to get trashed if you keep 
playing with us.&quot;

Sounding like she was talking to a stubborn child, Amy said calmly, 
&quot;Just shut up so I can finish, will you? All you have to do is listen.&quot;

Makoto roared back, &quot;I&#39;m not going to listen to you! Ami wasn&#39;t supposed 
to be involved in that fight to begin with! We were trying to give her 
some time to recover from the last time you got your filthy paws on her! 
All we wanted to do was have a nice sunny Saturday at the mall and you 
freaks showed up and trashed it!&quot;

Amy shrugged and said in an irritatingly cheerful tone, &quot;None of us can 
hide from our destinies.&quot;

Makoto responded by waving a hand in her direction as she made an 
attempt to ignore Amy and resumed moving furniture. The Senshi of 
thunder figured the TV stand would be heavy enough to keep her 
distracted from Amy&#39;s words.

&quot;You see, where I am from, Mina, that&#39;s Minako&#39;s double, is absolutely 
crazy about Ray, who is Rei&#39;s double. Unfortunately, Mina is strangely 
shy about bringing it up to Ray. So I was thinking, since things in your 
world are similar to things in mine . . .&quot;

Makoto stopped moving for a moment, and shook her head. &quot;Nope, mm-mm. 
Negative. Those two have shown no feelings toward each other like that.&quot;

Amy stood up, moved to the opposite side of the TV stand, leaned to the 
side a bit and looked into Makoto&#39;s eyes. &quot;Come on! You didn&#39;t openly 
show feelings toward Ami for a long time either, I bet. Ya know, I&#39;m 
thinking that&#39;s something similar to our worlds. Lita and I have been 
trying to set Ray and Mina up for a month now. I bet Rei and Minako had 
been trying for the two of you too the entire time. Don&#39;t you owe it to 
them to at least look into it?&quot;

Makoto opened her mouth to say something and was cut off by Amy, &quot;They 
probably looked around your computer. Tell me, how quick would it take 
someone to notice pictures of Ami on your computer if they were snooping 
around?&quot;

The look of annoyance on Makoto&#39;s face was something Amy would have paid 
good money to see again, if money were still in use in her world, that 
is. Amy didn&#39;t have time to think about that though, because the large 
TV stand suddenly flew forward as Makoto tried to crush Amy between the 
stand and the wall in frustration.

----------

Ami had helped Serena get to the top of the platform. It was all she 
could do to help Serena stand. The woman was clearly in pain. Ami said, 
&quot;I&#39;d better take a look at that. You may have broken a rib.&quot;

Serena shook her head. &quot;There isn&#39;t enough time. You said so yourself, 
your cover is blown. Once they find out, this will be the first place 
they look for you.&quot;

Ami forced Serena&#39;s hand away and started feeling along the Sekkou&#39;s 
side for any sign of injury. &quot;If it&#39;s left untreated, it could puncture 
your lung. It&#39;ll only take a second.&quot;

Serena placed a hand over Ami&#39;s and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;ll 
tell them you hit me or something.&quot;

It was Ami&#39;s turn to shake her head. &quot;No, you are coming with me. Lita 
knows the reason I&#39;m here is because of you. When they find you --&quot;

Serena sunk to her knees. As she did so, she reached out and hit the 
activation button on the control panel next to her. With a loud roar and 
a bright flash of light from the frame that made up the portal, Project 
Rainbow roared to life.

Ami looked behind her to see a reflection of herself staring back at 
her. &quot;Is that . . . ?&quot;

Serena nodded her head. Then she reached up, grabbed Ami&#39;s hand, and 
pressed something into it. Ami looked down to see another one of the 
star pendants used to get back to this reality. &quot;Give that to Amy. Send 
her back. Now go.&quot;

Ami reached down and tried to help Serena up again. She was just about 
to pull the Sekkou to her feet, when Serena jerked away, stumbling 
backward and crashing back to the cold steel walkway again. She lay 
there panting for breath.

Ami tried to help her up again, but Serena raised her hand. &quot;No. This is 
my fate. You have no right to decide this for me. Go, and think about 
what you have learned here. As strange as it sounds, you are the only 
hope my friends have of ever regaining their lost souls.&quot; Seeing the 
look of worry on Ami&#39;s face, Serena smiled and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll 
be fine. Go back to your friends and the one you love.&quot;

Seeing that smile reminded Ami so much of Usagi. She always thought of 
others, even the truly evil. At the same time, it made Ami believe the 
Sekkou meant what she said.

Just then, Ami heard something across the large room. She looked up to 
see the steel doors part away, and all of the remaining Sekkou, plus 
several military police storm into the room as fast as they could.

Serena shouted, &quot;There&#39;s no time! GO!&quot; With that, Dark Sailor Moon used 
her remaining strength to jump to her feet and shove Ami through the 
portal.

One moment Ami was standing in the dark room, the next, she was engulfed 
in a bright, blinding flash of light. Then, she heard and felt glass 
break all around her, as her body fell upon carpeted floor. Groaning, 
she rolled over, hearing the broken glass crack and feeling it cut into 
her more as she did so.

The next thing she was aware of, was being jerked off the ground, even 
off her feet, and into a tight bear hug, as someone tall and strong 
peppered her face with kisses between whispering over and over, &quot;I was 
so worried about you!&quot;

Ami said weakly, her head still spinning from everything that had just 
happened, &quot;Makoto?&quot;

The brunette gushed, &quot;Ami! I am never letting you out of my sight again! 
I --&quot;

Ami wheezed out, &quot;Mako-Chan, I can&#39;t breathe!&quot;

With that, Makoto loosened her grip around Ami, but didn&#39;t let go. Now 
able to breathe, Ami looked up at Makoto longingly. For a time, she had 
worried she would never see her again. Green eyes looked down at her, 
watering slightly as Makoto fought to hold back tears. They both leaned 
closer and --

&quot;Aw, such a Kodak moment. I don&#39;t suppose they bothered to give you 
anything so I could get home, did they?&quot; Amy stood nearby, tapping her 
foot on more of the broken glass. &quot;By the way, your landlord is going to 
be pissed when they find out you busted your bathroom mirror, and now, 
the glass doors to your balcony. Somehow, I doubt you will get your 
deposit back when you move out.&quot;

Before Makoto could say anything, Ami tossed the Sekkou the small, 
star-shaped pendent Serena gave her, which Amy caught with a smug smile, 
as she said, &quot;Last chance to take me out.&quot;

Ami stepped away from Makoto, and toward her double. &quot;Wait.&quot;

Amy activated the portal, but stopped and looked at Ami curiously.

Ami shook her head as she said, &quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be this way. Serena 
is right. We can try to find a way to help you, just give us time.

Amy looked at the portal, then looked at Ami as Makoto put an arm 
protectively around her waist. The Sekkou sighed quietly and looked down 
in an attempt to hide an expression that was a strange mixture of shame 
and anger. Despite her expression, when she spoke she sounded 
unemotional. &quot;You just don&#39;t get it, do you.&quot;

Makoto said angrily, &quot;Then explain it to us!&quot;

Still not able to make eye contact, Amy said, &quot;There is an old proverb 
that explains it better than any words I could come up with.&quot;

Angry blue eyes shot up to look at them as she said, &quot;There once was a 
fox that lived in a forest who was mortal enemies with the scorpion that 
resided there as well. One day, there was a forest fire, and the fox ran 
to the river to escape. At the river&#39;s banks, he saw the scorpion. The 
scorpion said, &#39;Give me a ride on your back across the river, and I give 
you my word we will never fight again&#39;. The fox said, &#39;Oh no, I don&#39;t 
think so. If I let you on my back, you will sting me and I will drown.&#39;&quot;

Amy stepped toward them clenching her fists angrily as she continued the 
old proverb. &quot;The Scorpion replied, &#39;No no, if I did that, we would both 
drown.&#39; The fox thought about it for a moment, then allowed the scorpion 
to climb up onto his back and he started to swim across the river. When 
they were half way there, the fox felt a sharp pain between his 
shoulders. The scorpion had stung him! As his limbs became weak, the Fox 
asked, &#39;Why? Why did you do that? We will both drown!&quot;

Amy stepped back into the portal to her world. Her ghostly voice 
finished the story from the other side just before it disappeared. 
&quot;&#39;Because,&#39; said the scorpion, &#39;tis in my nature&#39;&quot;.
