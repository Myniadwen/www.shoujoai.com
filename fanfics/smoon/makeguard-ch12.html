The Palace halls were deserted by this time of night. Ami usually liked 
walking through the Palace at night, in the silence of the evening, but 
she was just too tired to enjoy the atmosphere tonight, or lack there 
of. With all that had happened earlier, she was going to need a few days 
to adjust. Seeing those men, lying there on the floor beneath the Harpy, 
mangled almost beyond recognition, was not something one got over within 
hours. Ami had never seen such a sight in her life. How could the 
creature just kill like that? She let a few tears trail their way down 
her cheeks for those men. Not knowing them didn&#39;t dull the pain that 
filled her heart. They must have had families that cared for them. Loved 
ones that would miss them dearly.

A sound echoed in the hall, startling her momentarily. It sounded like a 
door closing. Peering into the dark corridor, however, she couldn&#39;t see 
much. It was unusually dark in this part of the Palace. Usually all of 
the candles on this hall would be lit, but tonight most of them had gone 
out completely. Well, it was expected, she supposed, for some things to 
go unnoticed after such an event. She knew that a few things had slipped 
her own mind in the wake of all that had happened. Walking forward, she 
steeled herself to walk into the darkness of the hall. Ami wasn&#39;t 
exactly afraid of the dark, but tonight was different. The safety of the 
Palace had been compromised and her imagination was getting the best of 
her. She took one step forward, and another. Her steps were muffled by 
the carpet running down the center of the hall. Her eyes adjusted to the 
darkness slowly and she could just see the outline of the suites of 
armor set into tall alcoves lining the walls. Tapestries, their 
depictions unclear, hung as dark shapes before her. Her heart beat fast, 
her eyes darting around. At one point she thought she saw one of the 
suites of armor move. &#39;Can&#39;t be Ami, it&#39;s just your imagination.&#39; She 
stopped and looked at the dark shape, her eyes finding the outline odd. 
She stepped closer, &#39;I&#39;m not afraid of some pile of inanimate metal.&#39; 
She gritted her teeth, squinting. Her eyes blurred with sleep, and she 
reached up to rub them quickly, clearing them so that she could take 
another look at the armor. When she finally looked back up, her eyes met 
complete darkness. All of the candles in the hall were now out. Her 
breath hitched as she felt the air in the hall move around her. Was 
there someone here with her?

Suddenly, something grabbed her arm and pulled her forward with a jerk. 
Two hands landed on her shoulders as she yelped in fear. &quot;BOO!&quot; came a 
low voice next to her ear. She froze for a second, her heart beating so 
fast that she thought it might jump right out of her chest. She was now 
breathing hard and sweating with panic. As realization washed over her, 
she gritted her teeth, in anger this time.

&quot;Minako!&quot; She said fiercely, her voice stilted. She pushed the woman 
back, away from her, hearing a low &#39;mfph&#39; as the blonde hit the wall, 
then a body audibly met the floor. She rushed forward in the darkness. 
&quot;Mina! I&#39;m so sorry, I didn&#39;t think that I&#39;d pushed you that hard, nor 
that we were that close to the wall. Where are you?&quot; She reached out 
feeling for her, finally Ami managed to find Minako and help her up. She 
couldn&#39;t see much in the dark, but Minako seemed to be fine.

&quot;Stay right here okay,&quot; Minako&#39;s voice came from in front of her. &quot;And 
keep your voice down.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; she replied as she felt Minako move away from her. She could 
see that even Minako&#39;s hair was black in the darkness of the hall. Her 
form disappeared completely from her sight for a few moments, she could 
hear the blonde moving about the hall and she seemed to be mumbling to 
herself about something. Then a light appeared a little ways from Ami, 
to her right. She turned looking down the hall to where Minako stood. 
The blonde was grinning, holding a lit candle.

She marched over to Minako, frowning. &quot;Minako, if you ever do that 
again, so help me I&#39;ll&#150; &quot;

&quot;Oh Ami, thank you for giving me another priceless moment.&quot; She was 
laughing lowly. &quot;I&#39;ll never forget that reaction for as long as I live. 
It was even better than the last time that I scared you.&quot; She continued 
laughing, trying not to be too loud.

Ami crossed her arms. &quot;That wasn&#39;t very funny Minako, not after what&#39;s 
happened tonight. I told you earlier that this isn&#39;t the time for 
playing.&quot; She sighed knowing that it was no use. &quot;And anyway, I don&#39;t 
even remember when you&#39;ve ever scared me before. I think that this is a 
first. You&#39;re usually jumping out at Rei, not me.&quot;

Minako scratched the back of her head, &quot;Really? You don&#39;t remember?&quot; Her 
laugh turned slightly nervous, &quot;Ah well, you must not remember because 
you were so young.&quot;

Ami looked thoughtful, &quot;Yes, I guess you&#39;re right. I can&#39;t keep up with 
all of your antics, but I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll remember this one.&quot;

&quot;As you should,&quot; Minako smiled, looking relieved, &quot;I&#39;d be quite hurt if 
you forgot about this one. It has been one of my finest moments.&quot;

&quot;I am honored,&quot; Ami said sarcastically as they began to walk down the 
hall.

&quot;My room is right here, so why don&#39;t you take the candle, okay?&quot;

Ami looked at her suspiciously, accepting the proffered candle, &quot;No more 
pranks tonight, and no following me in the darkness either.&quot;

&quot;Right, right, I&#39;ll be good. It&#39;s a promise,&quot; she went to go, then 
stopped, &quot;Ah, hey Ami, tell you what. Don&#39;t mention anything about me 
scaring you to Rei, and I won&#39;t mention how you yipped like a little 
puppy.&quot;

Ami blushed, &quot;I do not yip,&quot; she stated indignantly.

&quot;Riiight,&quot; Minako teased, &quot;I won&#39;t tell anybody how I scared you, so 
don&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Ami said, as she walked off down the corridor alone.

She was practically dead on her feet now. She had to get to her bed 
where she could sleep all of this away. After climbing a winding 
stairway, she finally reached the floor on which she would find her 
room. This was the uppermost floor and contained both the Jovian and 
Mercurian families. On another floor, below, were the families of Mars 
and Venus. Usagi&#39;s room was on the floor between the two. If, at any 
time, Usagi was in danger, the enemy would have to go through her 
guardians, no matter whether they came from above or below. The other 
families, including the outer planet guardians were situated in other 
wings of the Palace.

Ami disdained climbing the stairs tonight, and let out an exhausted sigh 
as she trudged down the hall. She passed an open air courtyard and 
paused to feel the night air on her skin. Looking ahead of her, she 
noticed which hall she was on. If she turned to the left, it would take 
her to her room. However, she kept walking straight, into a section of 
the Palace that had not been in use for years. One that she hadn&#39;t been 
to in a long time...

Thirteen years earlier

She was lost again. Looking around, the colors of emerald and gold met 
her eyes. She stopped in front of an ornate door, the symbol of Jupiter 
etched into its center. &#39;It seems that I&#39;ve wondered into the Jovian 
wing,&#39; her five year old mind surmised. &#39;I guess I should have taken a 
left back there after all.&#39; She shifted the stack of books she was 
carrying, and reached up to pull her overly large hood back from her 
eyes. She jerked in surprise at the sound of footsteps behind her. As a 
result, the books went tumbling to the ground, the noise loud in the 
hall.

&quot;Ah,&quot; her little voice sounded in disappointment, as she went to her 
knees trying to gather the books quickly. At this late hour, it would be 
rude to wake anyone up by being so clumsy. She should have paid more 
attention to the time and returned from the library earlier. The 
footsteps behind her came to a halt, and an arm appeared around her, 
picking up one of the books. She turned around, a few books already in 
her arms. Ami wasn&#39;t sure who she&#39;d expected to see. A guard maybe, or 
an adult ready to scold her for being up so late. Instead, her eyes met 
those of an older girl. She was much taller than Ami, and it was hard to 
tell how much older she may be. Her green eyes were what caught Ami&#39;s 
attention. She&#39;d never seen eyes like these before. &#39;This must be a 
Jovian,&#39; she thought, watching the girl bend down before her, and begin 
picking up the books.

She was wearing green night clothes. Her brown, shoulder length hair 
kept falling into her face, obstructing her view. She pushed it back 
with one hand, saying something in a foreign tongue. After she gathered 
all of the books off of the floor, she made no move to give them to Ami. 
Instead, she stood and said something in that foreign language again. 
Ami looked at her questioningly. When Ami didn&#39;t respond, the girl 
looked thoughtful.

&quot;Follow,&quot; she motioned to Ami. The word was in the common tongue, though 
a bit hard to understand with her accent. Ami walked after the girl as 
she took off down the corridor. Seeing that Ami was having a hard time 
keeping up, the girl slowed her pace.

&quot;What is your name?&quot; Ami asked.

The girl didn&#39;t respond, but donned a frustrated look and continued to 
walk. Ami frowned. &#39;She doesn&#39;t understand me?&#39; This was new to Ami. She 
didn&#39;t know how to communicate with someone who didn&#39;t understand her 
language. What was she supposed to do?

She pointed to herself and looked over at the girl. &quot;Ami.&quot; She said 
clearly.

The girl arched one eyebrow, and pointed at herself in return, &quot;Makoto,&quot; 
she smiled a little and continued walking. Ami smiled as well, following 
after her, gripping the books she still held against her chest.

They took the hall that Ami should have originally taken and headed to 
the end, passing her parents&#39; room and several others along the way. 
They finally came to a tall white door, with the symbol of Mercury 
etched in its center, just like the other doors on the hall. Makoto 
tried the handle and pushed it open easily. Ami went ahead into the 
room, which was lit by several low burning oil lamps. The servants must 
have already been in to check for her. They would come back shortly to 
check again, but Ami figured that she would be in bed by then.

Makoto went over to the bed and set the books down, her eyes taking in 
the room as she went. The room was done in the royal colors of Mercury. 
Blue and Silver. It was a little dark inside, but Ami liked it that way. 
She usually just read by the light of a lamp or candle anyway. Having 
put the books on the bed, Makoto turned to leave.

Ami went after her, stopping her at the doorway. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, 
hoping the girl would understand her. Makoto gave her that same confused 
look. Ami found herself wishing that she knew Makoto&#39;s language. Maybe 
then she&#39;d be able to talk to her. Find out more about her. She didn&#39;t 
seem to know the common tongue well enough for conversation. Ami wanted 
her to stay, but why? They couldn&#39;t talk, so there was no reason for her 
to stay.

She looked up at Makoto again. &quot;I know. I&#39;ll learn your language, then 
I&#39;ll be able to talk to you. Some day we&#39;ll talk, okay?&quot; She smiled at 
Makoto, who now looked sad for some reason. Ami didn&#39;t want her to be 
sad. Leaning forward quickly, Ami rapped her arms around the taller 
girl&#39;s waste, hugging her tightly. &quot;Thank you, Makoto.&quot;

Makoto tensed slightly at first, but then relaxed, hugging the small 
girl back awkwardly. When Ami finally let go, Makoto tousled her hair 
and opened the door. Just before she closed it, she looked in at Ami, 
giving her a slight wave, &quot;Goodnight,&quot; she said in her strange dialect.

Ami waved back as the door closed, leaving her alone in the room. She 
went to bed that night, thinking of how she would go back to the library 
the next day and find books on the Jovian language. The next time she 
saw Makoto, she wanted to be able to better communicate with the older 
girl.

Fate, however, would see to it that Ami did not meet Makoto again for a 
very long time. Ami would learn the Jovian language and after that, many 
other languages would follow. Forgetting her original purpose, she 
continued to live in her mind, absorbed in the world of her books once 
again. Fate intervened several times into Ami&#39;s world, none for the 
better. Ami was easily hurt, but her strong will helped her get through 
those hard times. Her past has shaped her, as has Makoto&#39;s. And now, 
Fate would have Ami meet Makoto once again.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

Ami stared blankly at the door before her. She was in front of her own 
door now. The symbol of Mercury shining in the dim lamp light. The 
memory had come to her out of no where. She&#39;d totally forgotten the 
encounter. &#39;So, I&#39;ve met her before. I bet that she doesn&#39;t even 
remember.&#39;

She hardly remembered making it back here to her door, it was more like 
Makoto had brought her here again, from in front of the room that must 
have been hers. She looked back down the hall one last time, then, 
turning the handle on her door, she went in. The room was the same as it 
had been back then, nothing changed much. Maybe the sheets were a little 
different, and the curtains as well, but otherwise, everything was in 
the same place.

She blew at the bangs on her forehead. &#39;How nostalgic.&#39; Dragging her 
feet slightly, she moved into the room, and fell onto her bed, letting 
out a breath of exhaustion. She&#39;d have to get back up and change into 
her night clothes, but for now she just lay there. That is, until she 
caught sight of what was sitting on the table next to her bed.

&quot;Wow,&quot; She breathed in amazement, sitting up slowly. A large vase of the 
bluest roses that she had ever seen sat before her. Bluest? Well, she&#39;d 
never actually seen blue roses before. Never even knew that they 
existed. She could swear that they were glowing in the candle light. 
&quot;Magnificant.&quot; she stood, looking them over thoroughly, feeling herself 
blush as she did so. They were just so beautiful, she couldn&#39;t take her 
eyes off of them. She noticed a small envelop lying on the table as 
well. Picking it up and turning it over, she smiled upon seeing the 
royal crest of Jupiter emblazoned across the front. She remembered what 
Minako had said to Makoto earlier that evening and repeated it to 
herself, &quot;They&#39;re simply beautiful.&quot; &#39;So that&#39;s why Minako was so 
excited about her gift. I can understand why. I&#39;m almost tempted to go 
back and thank her too.&#39;

She bent forward, inhaling their wonderful scent. &#39;And they smell 
delightful.&#39; If possible, her smile grew. &#39;Well, I&#39;ll surely thank her 
tomorrow.&#39;

She remembered the last time that someone had given her roses, and her 
smile faltered momentarily. She was happy at the time, but the events 
that followed were not very pleasant. They were memories that she did 
not wish to remember. Especially now, of all times and all nights. She 
pushed those memories back, moving away from the roses and to her 
wardrobe, where she changed her clothes for bed. When, finally, she lay 
down to sleep, the last thing that her eyes saw, before she fell fast 
into a peaceful slumber, were those beautiful blue roses, that seemed to 
shine even in the dark.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

Rei sat on her bed contemplating. She&#39;d been sitting there for quite a 
while. Glancing at the object in her hand, and then across the room. 
&#39;Fool, make up your mind now, else she&#39;ll be asleep soon, if she isn&#39;t 
already!&#39; She made a frustrated sound, gripping the object tightly. She 
felt stupid. What made her think that Minako would want this? It didn&#39;t 
even suite her at all. Rei had picked it out based on her own taste, and 
couldn&#39;t imagine how she let herself do that. Now Minako probably hated 
her for several different reasons, and not that she had made any attempt 
to correct that. Despite all of the endless pranks and annoyances, 
Minako was a good friend, and Rei wanted to show her that. However, she 
couldn&#39;t find one single thing that the Princess of Venus needed. She 
had everything already. What could Rei give her?

Looking down at the object once more, she sighed tiredly and made up her 
mind. &#39;I&#39;ll give it to her anyway. Better this than nothing. If she&#39;ll 
even accept it.&#39;

Getting up from the bed, she didn&#39;t walk to the door. Instead, she went 
to the back of her room, to a large tapestry that hung from the ceiling 
to the floor. Pulling it back, she felt for something. Her hand finally 
felt the cold handle of the door she was looking for. Unlocking it, she 
pushed it forward, walking into the narrow corridor beyond. It was a bit 
cold in the narrow space. She held out her hand, summoning a small flame 
to light her path through the darkness. If memory served her correctly, 
it should be two right turns, then the door on the left. She nodded to 
herself and proceeded through the darkness. These secret corridors were 
made for quick escapes, and not many knew of them, save for a few of the 
guardians and the Queen herself. They were only to be implemented in 
emergencies usually, but Minako made a point of abusing them regularly. 
Thus, most of them were left locked. After a bit of walking, and some 
right turns, she finally came to the end of her short journey. Stumbling 
in the darkness, she paused, hoping no one in the other rooms may have 
heard her. Hearing nothing, she reached her target. Light could be seen 
at the bottom of the door, barely visible because of the tapestry that 
hung on the other side.

She tapped lightly on the door, listening for movement on the other 
side. She heard footsteps and then a door opened, though not the one 
that she stood before. Minako must have assumed that someone was at her 
door. She heard a whisper, then more footsteps. This time coming in her 
direction. She stepped to the side as the door opened. The light from 
the room hurt her eyes, and she squinted against it. Minako stood there, 
smirking at her.

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Since when do you use these passages? Or am I to assume that this is an 
emergency?&quot; She arched one eyebrow.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not an emergency. But, well...never mind.&quot; She actually felt 
relieved that Mina was turning her away, but her voice shook just a 
little regardless. Minako&#39;s expression changed, and she smiled at Rei.

&quot;I&#39;m just playing with you. Get in here already.&quot; She moved aside to let 
Rei in.

Once in the room, Rei took in its familiar appearance. It was decorated 
in gold and white, thus making it quite a bright room. Rei&#39;s own room 
was darker. Deep shades of red, and only the smallest amounts of silver 
were what greeted one upon entering it. But she liked in that way. 
Minako&#39;s room matched her personality nicely. Bright, warm, and 
beautiful. Minako&#39;s full canopy bed had sheets of white, and gold drapes 
that puddled onto the floor around it. Inside, at the head, two candles 
burned brightly in sconces on the wall, illuminating it further. It was 
a very elegant and romantic room. Rei felt out of place in her crimson 
bed clothes, her dark figure contrasting greatly with her surroundings. 
She put her hands behind her back, wishing she had pockets, so that she 
could stuff the small object in one of them. Minako noticed her 
fidgeting.

&quot;Is something wrong, Rei?&quot; She asked, coming closer to the dark-haired 
woman. Rei felt Minako take hold of her arm and guide her. She let 
herself be pulled by Minako, who took her over to the bed to sit down.

&quot;Well,&quot; Rei started, her voice rough. She coughed, clearing her throat, 
while noting how soft the bed beneath her was. Just as soft as the hand 
on her arm, and the eyes that looked upon her with worry. &quot;I-I thought 
that you might be angry with me.&quot;

Minako looked surprised, &quot;Rei, why would I be angry with you? Maybe a 
little annoyed, but that blows over fast. You should know me well enough 
by now.&quot; She smiled in conclusion.

&quot;I&#39;m talking about the fact that I didn&#39;t leave you a gift, Mina.&quot;

Minako rolled her eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid. What kind of friend would I be 
if I got mad about something like that? Did you like the quiver by the 
way?&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes lit up, &quot;Of course! It&#39;s wonderful. I never imagined that red 
and gold could look that good together.&quot;

Minako gave a satisfied smile, &quot;I did.&quot;

Rei nodded, but then her frown returned, &quot;Which is why I feel bad about 
this.&quot; She extended her right hand in front of Minako. In it she held a 
red ribbon. It was made of some of the finest silk imported from Earth 
that Rei could find. There was no unique design about it at all, but for 
the simple fact that it shown a brilliant red in the light of the room. 
Minako took it from her hand, and Rei didn&#39;t look at her face. She 
didn&#39;t want to see the disappointment there.

Silence descended upon the room for what seemed an eternity to Rei.

&quot;It&#39;s wonderful Rei,&quot; came Minako&#39;s excited voice from beside her.

&quot;What?&quot; Was Rei&#39;s startled reply.

&quot;I love it! Why would you feel bad about giving this to me? Do you see 
anything of its like in this room?&quot;

Rei cast her eyes around again, &quot;No, that&#39;s why I thought that you 
wouldn&#39;t like it. You see, I liked it, that&#39;s why I got it for you.&quot;

&quot;And I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way,&quot; Minako stated firmly. &quot; If you 
like it, then it&#39;s even better.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s just a ribbon,&quot; Rei said stubbornly.

&quot;One that I don&#39;t have, and that you are giving me.&quot;

&quot;What will you do with it though?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll find something, don&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;Still, it&#39;s just a&#150; &quot; Rei started, but was cut off when Minako lunged 
forward, hugging her tightly.

&quot;Will you just shut up already Rei. You did good, and I&#39;m very 
grateful.&quot; Minako pulled back, looking at Rei. Her arms still around 
Rei&#39;s shoulders.

Rei smiled, &quot;Then I&#39;m glad that you like it.&quot;

&quot;You sound very relieved. Were you really that worried?&quot; Minako&#39;s voice 
was gentle, and she brushed back some of Rei&#39;s bangs with one hand just 
as gently a she said her words. Rei felt her face heat up at the 
contact.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she managed, though her ability to speak was leaving her for 
some unknown reason. &quot;You were acting funny earlier.&quot; She felt Minako&#39;s 
leg move against her own. It was still there from Minako&#39;s sudden hug, 
and she hadn&#39;t seen fit to move back away from Rei yet. It was warm, in 
fact Rei felt very warm just being near Minako like this. Was Minako 
even closer now?

&quot;Me? Acting funny? I thought I was always funny.&quot; A sly smile crossed 
over Minako&#39;s face as she leaned forward, touching her forehead to 
Rei&#39;s. Rei could feel Minako&#39;s sweet breath against her face, her thumb 
was moving slowly against the skin of her neck. Rei trembled at the 
feeling. &#39;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39; Minako was moving closer to her, the 
warmth building inside Rei grew as she neared. Rei became aware of the 
fact that her own hands were on Minako&#39;s waste, not moving. When did 
they get there? Once she realized this fact, she had the sudden urge to 
move them. The strange thing, though, was that she wasn&#39;t wanting to 
move them away, but in a totally different direction. Up? Down? Either 
way, she just wanted to experience the feel of the silken gown moving 
against Minako&#39;s wonderfully soft skin. Her hands flexed compulsively at 
the thought and she froze. Minako was very close now, the breath between 
them seemed like one. &#39;What am I doing?&#39; She closed her eyes as she 
waited for something. Anything. She most definately wasn&#39;t waiting for 
the loud clang that resounded outside of the room. It was so surprising 
that her eyes shot open and she sprang back from Minako. She took one 
look at the blonde and then ran for the door, swinging it open wildly.

&quot;Who&#39;s there!&quot; She growled into the darkness outside. &#39;When did it get 
so dark out here?&#39; A sound on the floor to her right drew her attention. 
A small boy was propping himself up with one hand, and rubbing his head 
with the other. He caught sight of her and his eyes looked frightened.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry my Lady,&quot; he rolled into a bowing position. &quot;The corridor 
was dark, so someone sent for me to light the candles. I didn&#39;t mean to 
wake thee.&quot; Rei saw the over-turned wooden bucket that he was using as a 
makeshift stool, and the brass candle holder laying on the floor beside 
him. She brought a hand up to rub her own head.

&quot;Boy,&quot; she snapped. He stood immediately, fear still in his eyes. She 
softened her gaze on him. &quot;Go to bed, alright.&quot; She forced a smiled.

&quot;B-but,&quot; he looked down the dark corridor, &quot;the candles my Lady.&quot;

Rei nodded, then snapped her fingers. The entire hall was illuminated as 
every candle ignited at once. &quot;There, that&#39;s better then.&quot;

The boy grinned in delight, looking very excited at witnessing such a 
demonstration of power first hand. Rei tilted her head, &quot;Off to bed with 
you now.&quot;

The boy bowed to her, and padded off down the hall quickly, taking his 
bucket with him. Rei sighed and turned around, only to come face to face 
with Minako. &quot;That was great Rei!&quot; She clapped excitedly. Rei looked 
down and ducked around Minako.

&quot;It&#39;s wasn&#39;t such a big deal.&quot;

Minako meandered over to sit on the bed once again.

&quot;I better go get some rest now,&quot; Rei said hastily, backing away from the 
bed, towards the door at the back of the room.

&quot;You probably should,&quot; said Minako, stretching out on the bed in her 
white gown, her hair cascading over the edge.

Rei ran into a chair that wasn&#39;t quite pushed under a nearby desk. She 
tripped over her feet and fell to her side on the white carpeted floor. 
Cursing, she scrambled up and finally made it to the tapestry. Pulling 
it back, Minako&#39;s voice stopped her. &quot;Rei.&quot;

Rei looked over at the blonde, who was now lying on her stomach, hands 
propped under her chin. &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re acting funny.&quot; Minako giggled, fingernails tapping her teeth.

Rei laughed lightly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;m fine. Just a little 
tired is all. See you in the morning, okay?&quot;

Minako tilted her head, &quot;Yeah, goodnight Rei. Sweet dreams.&quot;

Rei waved quickly and bolted out of the door and into the narrow 
passage. It was even colder now than it had been before, though she was 
sweating for some reason, and her heart was beating fast. &#39;What just 
happened? What was I about to do?&#39; She was very confused, and in her 
befuddled state of mind, she lost her way several times in the narrows 
passages. When she finally reached her own door and entered the room 
beyond, she went directly to bed. If she was lucky, sleep would claim 
her soon. Tomorrow she would sort this whole mess out during meditation. 
&#39;That is if I can even concentrate enough by then!&#39; she shouted in her 
mind. Putting a pillow over her head, she settled in, waiting for sleep 
to overcome her frazzled mind.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

&quot;Does it really not bother you?&quot; A musical voice echoed suddenly in the 
darkness of the room.

&quot;I said that I&#39;m not bothered, did I not?&quot; A lower voice answered 
calmly.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have reacted the way that you did, if it did not bother 
you...&quot;

&quot;Why are we discussing this now of all times?&quot; The low voice was 
irritated.

&quot;Because if I had said something before, you would have easily 
distracted me.&quot; A humorous tone was used.

&quot;You think that I could not distract you now, Michiru?&quot;

&quot;Haruka...&quot;

&quot;Alright, ask what you will of me.&quot; Haruka&#39;s tall frame shifted beneath 
the covers of the bed to lean over the other woman. Her hair was damp 
with sweat and her eyes alight with playfulness. Her arms slid 
underneath her partner&#39;s smaller frame, holding her loosely.

Michiru looked up at Haruka, sincerity in her eyes. &quot;Does it really not 
bother you? I won&#39;t give the memory back to her if it displeases you 
so.&quot;

Haruka frowned slightly. &quot;It&#39;s not the memory that worries me at all. 
It&#39;s more of that fact that it would never have happened had I not been 
so stupid. It&#39;s just a reminder to me, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Michiru reached up to tuck Haruka&#39;s damp hair behind one 
ear, then letting her fingers trail down the side of her jaw and neck..

Haruka hushed Michiru with a finger to her lips. &quot;I told you never to 
apologize for it. I don&#39;t own you, and I never did. It was my own fault 
for not seeing what I had, and for turning you away in such a state. 
Whatever you did after that is none of my concern. It is my punishment, 
if anything, and as it should be.&quot;

Michiru smiled. &quot;Thank you Haruka, for understanding. I should apologize 
for tonight though.&quot;

&quot;What about tonight?&quot;

&quot;I had to know how you felt about this, so I gouged your reaction by 
reminding you...by kissing her. I watched you while I danced you know. 
You were smiling all night, but your smile disappeared when I danced 
with her...&quot;

Haruka looked surprised, then a bit sheepish. &quot;Really?&quot;

Michiru pulled her closer, &quot;Really.&quot;

Haruka hugged her, the warmth of Michiru&#39;s smooth skin making her 
shudder once again, &quot;If, after you give the memory back. If she wants 
you, then I will fight for you. I will not give you up so easily. Now 
that I hold you in my arms, I realize that there could be nothing more 
than this for me. I will pursue you for all eternity if I have to.&quot;

&quot;Haruka I&#150;&quot;

&quot;However,&quot; she interrupted before Michiru could stop her, &quot;if somehow, 
you realize that she makes you happier than I could. If you want to go 
to her...then go. As long as you are happy, I care not what happens to 
me. It is your decision in the end.&quot; There was fear in Haruka&#39;s eyes as 
she spoke, but she did not pull back to let Michiru see.

Michiru stroked her back, trying to sooth the Uranian Princess. &quot;Haruka, 
quit saying such foolish things.&quot; She pushed Haruka up slightly, so that 
she could look into her eyes. &quot;You&#39;re afraid that I&#39;ll leave, aren&#39;t 
you? Do you think that I am so fickle as that? I chose you the moment 
that I saw you. Besides, it wasn&#39;t love that drove Makoto to respond to 
me. What I did with her, I did out of loneliness and despair,&quot; she 
laughed lightly, &quot;and maybe even a little anger.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t blame you. I hate that I made you feel that way.&quot; Haruka smiled 
sadly. &quot;But I was afraid then too.&quot;

Michiru let her fingers slide into Haruka&#39;s hair, laying her arm across 
the woman&#39;s toned shoulder. &quot;Most people fear things that are more 
powerful than they are. And love is a very powerful feeling.&quot;

&quot;It makes me feel more powerful just being with you.&quot; Haruka said 
honestly, the truth reflecting in her eyes. Michiru smiled at the 
honesty there, the innocence.

Michiru nodded. &quot;My feelings exactly.&quot; She pulled Haruka down to her, 
there lips meeting in a kiss that expressed those same feelings. 
Powerful and exciting. The intensity of it filling them both with 
longing and desire.

Haruka pulled away from her and smirked, the playfulness returning, &quot;But 
still, I can&#39;t help being jealous you know.&quot;

Michiru arched one eyebrow, then her neck, as Haruka lowered her head, 
pressing her lips against the soft skin there. &quot;I didn&#39;t think that you 
were capable of being jealous.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m capable of many things when I&#39;m around you,&quot; she said, 
against Michiru&#39;s shoulder. Michiru could feel herself flush as Haruka&#39;s 
hands ventured their way across her skin. She mumbled something 
incoherent, and Haruka paused, &quot;What was that? You&#39;ll have to speak more 
clearly,&quot; she teased.

&quot;A-Aren&#39;t you tired?&quot; She managed at last, her eyes closing in pleasure. 
She trembled under the tall woman&#39;s frame. Warm kisses were being placed 
delicately upon her stomach, and her heart pounded in her ears as she 
felt Haruka&#39;s sandy blonde hair inadvertently slide across her chest as 
she kissed her. Those hands were still wandering. They did something, 
Michiru&#39;s thoughts were so jumbled that she couldn&#39;t even begin to know 
what, but it made her moan in a way that she didn&#39;t think herself 
capable of, but then again, she was with Haruka. She smiled in delighted 
pleasure at the thought.

Haruka made her way back up Michiru&#39;s body slowly, her hands teasing 
more than her words ever could. &quot;Ah, but does a priestess need such 
energy to worship her goddess throughout the night? Devoting herself so 
fully to such an act. So it is with me. I will worship you until you bid 
me to stop. For your very presence is a blessing upon this unworthy 
soul.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s voice was labored as she replied with humor, &quot;Your honeyed 
words will not work on me as they do with others.&quot; Another heartfelt 
moan escaped her throat.

Haruka was suddenly above her, with Michiru&#39;s arms firmly pinned beneath 
her hands. Michiru&#39;s chest rose and fell with her heavy breathing. Sweat 
glazed her porcelain skin. Haruka&#39;s face was very close, and as her lips 
brushed ever so close to Michiru&#39;s, she whispered in the stillness of 
the moment, &quot;Let&#39;s try something else then...shall we?&quot;</pre>
