<h1>Don't Look Back (part 1 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<pre>In Canada(AN: ^_^;;)&#133;

Michiru Kaioh packed swiftly, tears running down her pale face down to 
her bruised shoulders and arms.

&#145;She won&#146;t hurt me anymore&#133;if he doesn&#146;t believe me, fine&#133;she won&#146;t 
hurt me anymore&#133;&#146;the aqua haired girl thought feverishly, taking a 
moment to pick up a small picture frame from where it was hidden in 
her dresser to look at it. Three figures smiled back at her, causing a 
small sob to rack her slim frame as she gazed at her younger self, 
attached to her mothers leg as her parents laughed lovingly at her&#133;

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;Smile Sarah! Don&#146;t look into the camera!&#148; Haruka Ten&#39;oh yelled, 
sweating under the hot studio lights as she tried to get the beautiful 
girl before her to stop staring into the camera Haruka was holding.

&#147;Awww, common Ruka, don&#146;t be mad at me baby&#133;&#148; the airhead whined, 
batting her eyelashes at Haruka in what she thought was an appealing 
way. Haruka winced, wishing for a moment that the girls knew she was 
female.

&#147;Don&#146;t. Look. At. The. Camera.&#148; The blond finally ground out, causing 
the young woman to look startled a moment before doing exactly what 
Haruka&#146;s partner was telling her to do&#133;

&#145;Clothes&#133;money&#133;airplane ticket&#133;&#146; Michiru listed off the items in her 
head as she packed them away, taking only one suitcase with her. She 
tucked her wallet into her back pocket before waiting for the sound of 
her Father and stepmothers quiet talking to fade away.

&#145;oh mom&#133;I wish you were here to protect me&#133;I miss you so much&#133;&#146; she 
thought silently, pulling the worn picture from her wallet to stare 
silently at the beautiful aqua haired woman in it. An hour passes 
silently as Michiru&#146;s muscles wound themselves tighter, begging to be 
moved, even as Michiru refused to leave her crouching position beside 
her door. Finally, she stood, rotating her sore shoulders before 
hulling her bag over her shoulder. If she ran, she could make the next 
bus to the airport&#133;

Haruka sighed, throwing herself into the padded chair behind her 
office desk. Her partner, Derek(AN: teehee), sat on the other side, 
looking just as exhausted as his boss.

&#147;At least we finished this shoot. Want me to drop the picture folders 
off at the Vogue Mag. Office?&#148; Derek asked, lounging in the chair 
opposite with a brooding look on his face. Haruka grinned slightly, 
sliding the thick folders across the desk to her friend.

&#147;you leaving now?&#148; the blond asked, checking her watch before looking 
back at the dark haired man across from her. Derek nodded, pushing his 
round glasses higher up the bridge of his nose.(AN: think, older Harry 
Potter.), &#147;see you Monday then.&#148;

Derek nodded, grumbling something under his breath before picking up 
the folders and leaving the room. Haruka stood, turning around to look 
out the wall of windows behind her before picking up her jacket, 
heading out the door to follow her partner, letting the cleaning crew 
close up. Today had been a long day and she had a couple races in the 
morning&#133;

Michiru finally let go of her baited breath as she sat lower in the 
cushioned airplane seat, looking out the window as the place finally 
started moving.

&#145;sorry Alicia, you may have my father fooled, but you can&#146;t hurt me 
anymore&#133;goodbye Canada&#133;&#146; Michiru finally thought to herself, touching 
the thick glass window.

&#147;missin&#146; someone already?&#148; the friendly older man beside her asked, 
noticing the trail of tears on the young girls face.

Michiru shook her head sadly, giving him a reassuring smile before 
turning back to watch the ground fall from beneath her.

&#147;goodbye&#133;&#148;</pre>
