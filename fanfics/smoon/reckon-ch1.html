<h1>Thoughts of Home: The Reckoning (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sailordoc.html">Sailor Doc</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s note: This story takes place after my previous story, 
&quot;Thoughts Of Home&quot;-&#39;A Picture-Perfect Afternoon&#39;.  It is not necessary 
to read that story to understand this one, but it might help.  Enjoy!
__________________________________________________

Laughter echoed softly off the walls of the beautifully appointed room 
in the Tenou/Kaioh house.  All of the senshi had gathered at Haruka 
and Michiru&#39;s request to celebrate what they insisted on calling Ami 
and Makoto&#39;s anniversary.  It had been a year to the day since that 
memorable spring afternoon when they had caught Ami and Makoto kissing 
under the cherry trees.

The party had been planned as a surprise and Ami could not help but be 
touched that they had remembered the date, much less put together a 
modest party for them.  Looking at Makoto seated next to her on the 
couch, she could tell her girlfriend was just as moved as she was.  
Her face, in profile, was relaxed, a happy smile in place, her eyes 
sparkling in merriment as Haruka finished a tale of her courtship of 
Michiru.

&quot;And so,&quot; Haruka concluded, &quot;though I know my Mother and Father love 
me to distraction, I finally came to the realization that I am as dirt 
in their eyes compared to &#39;the fair Michiru&#39;, who is the most gifted, 
most beautiful, most talented, best dressed, best mannered, most...&quot;

&quot;Haruka!&quot;  Michiru scolded lightly, as her eyes darted from one amused 
face to another in the room.  &quot;Please!  You know that&#39;s just not so.&quot;

Affecting a sad face and puppy-dog eyes, Haruka had shook her head and 
responded.  &quot;Ah, but it is true, my love.&quot;  Smiling, she leaned 
forward and kissed the back of the hand she held in hers.  &quot;And in 
this case it is my pleasure to bow to the wisdom of my parents.&quot;

Ami, Makoto and the rest of the girls laughed at the antics of the 
older couple.  It seemed in the year following the battle with Galaxia 
they had realized just how precious their life together was, and it 
showed each time the girls saw them together.

&quot;How about your folks, Michiru&quot;,  Rei asked gently, though she already 
suspected the answer.

Michiru&#39;s expression saddened as Haruka squeezed her hand.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that story does not have quite the same happy ending as 
Haruka&#39;s did.&quot;  Smiling apologetically at the group, she said, 
&quot;parents don&#39;t always respond with open arms to the people their 
children decide to spend their life&#39;s with.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Michiru,&quot; Usagi said, her lovely blue eyes 
understanding and compassionate.  &quot;Some stories are best left untold.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps another day,&quot;  Michiru said with a sad little smile.  Seeming 
to draw comfort and strength from the close presence of her real 
family, Haruka at her side, Setsuna, just behind her, a hand on her 
her shoulder, and Hotaru seated at her feet, she had drawn herself up 
and smiled. &quot;Besides,&quot; she continued. &quot;This is a day to celebrate 
happy beginnings.&quot; Turning toward Ami and Makoto she asked, &quot;so what 
about you two?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;  Makoto asked.

&quot;You know, what about you two?&quot;  Haruka asked.

&quot;What about what?&quot;  Makoto returned, suddenly showing signs of 
nervousness.

Rolling her eyes, Minako had piped in, &quot;For gods sake, Mako-chan!  She 
wants to know how you two broke the news about your relationship to 
Ami&#39;s Mom.&quot;

Makoto was unable to stop either the groan or the wince that escaped 
her at Mina&#39;s use of the word &#39;broke&#39;.  Usually the word would have no 
more effect than any other, but used in the same sentence with &#39;your 
relationship&#39; and &#39;Ami&#39;s Mom&#39;...that was a different story!

Ami could feel Makoto starting to tense up next to her.  She grinned 
at her lover as she gently stroked her arm.

&quot;I think I&#39;d better handle this story, love&quot;  she said.

**********************************************************************

Breaking the news to their fellow senshi had really not been a 
problem. Haruka and Michiru already knew, but could be trusted to keep 
things to themselves until Ami and Makoto decided to enlighten 
everyone else.  They had planned a get together at Makoto&#39;s a week or 
so later to make the announcement.  It had all gone off rather well.  
Most of the inner girls were momentarily stunned with the exception 
being Minako-chan who had screamed, then laughed and said, &quot;I knew it!  
I just KNEW it!&quot;  With tears and kisses she had congratulated them, 
saying how happy she was for them and that they were just made for 
each other, of course!  Mina&#39;s silliness had brought everyone else out 
of their shocked states and they had been welcomed with open arms, as 
well as open mouths as everyone had tried to start talking at once.

Makoto and Ami had stood in the midst of all the ensuing chaos with 
happy smiles and light hearts.

That was one hurdle.  However, they still had one more to go...Ami&#39;s 
Mom.

They were both in agreement that they should tell her.  Goodness 
knows, they already had to keep enough from her concerning their 
secret lives as it was.  Ami didn&#39;t want to keep this from her too.  
She felt, and Makoto agreed, that they should be open with her mother 
about the true nature of their relationship.  But that left two rather 
large questions looming over their heads.  &#39;When&#39; and &#39;how&#39;?

After much discussion, they had decided on the following Sunday 
afternoon. Makoto was coming over to eat lunch with them and then 
spend the day and it seemed the best time.  They had already been 
dating for two months and the relationship had been intimate a little 
over three weeks, so there was no doubt it was time.

With that decision made, they settled down to their regular weekly 
routines, slightly nervous, but confident that they were doing the 
right thing.

Unfortunately, Father Time seemed to have his own schedule to keep, 
and it didn&#39;t agree with their plans, no matter how carefully they 
were made.

**********************************************************************

&quot;O-o-o-o-h, that sounds ominous,&quot;  Minako intoned in a scary voice.  
&quot;I take it your original plan fell through?&quot;

With a groan, Makoto leaned forward, covering her face with her hands.

&quot;Nice choice of words, Mina-chan,&quot;  Ami said with a twinkle in her eye 
as she wrapped an arm around Makoto&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;You could 
definitely say that.&quot;
