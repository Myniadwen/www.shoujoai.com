<h1>Oira Imei Satsu Made Shikyo (We Shall Stay Together Until Death) (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chibistar.html">Sailor Chibi Star Fighter</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     Haruka was offically in terrible shock. Not only were the 
Starlights back, as females, but Usagi, her princess, had dumped 
Mamoru for female Seiya!!! x.x Mamoru didn&#39;t even care and started 
hitting on Kakyuu o.o needless to say he was beaten up, by Kakyuu &not;.&not; 
Plus, Chibiusa was back, though no one knew how considering Usagi&#39;s 
breakup, but Chibiusa seemed perfectly alright with it. o.o;;

------------------------------------------------------------

      &quot;YAAAAAWWWWNNNNNN..............&quot; Usagi stretched and rolled out 
of bed, pulling her robe on. It was summer vacation but Usagi was 
actually up early. Seiya was taking her to the amusment park that 
morning.
      Slinking down the stairs Usagi hobbled into the kitchen and 
poured herself a glass of orange juice. She took a sip as she looked 
out the window.
      &quot;AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; 
      Seiya hopped in the open window, taking the horrible mask off 
her face and grinned at Usagi. The orange juice was now all over the 
moon child and her hair was now all sticky. Seiya could barely contain 
her laughter at the sight of her girlfriend.
      &quot;Oh Odango.... you never cease to make me laugh...&quot; she giggled.
      Usagi got a dish rag and wiped her face off. All the while 
glaring at the raven haired girl. &quot;I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it...&quot; she 
muttered. That only made Seiya laugh harder. Usagi hit her upside the 
head with the empty glass. &quot;DONT YOU EVER DO THAT TO ME AGAIN!!!&quot; 
Seiya collapsed in laughter. Usagi glared at her.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      Haruka slumped down on the couch with a depressed sigh. She 
flipped through the channels until she found a car race. But after 
about five seconds she turned it off and threw the controls down on 
the floor, even that couldn&#39;t cheer her up. &quot;Shimatta...&quot;
      Michiru leaned over the back of the couch. &quot;Daijoubu &#39;Ruka?&quot; she 
asked worriedly, leaning over farther and wrapping her arms around the 
wind senshi&#39;s neck.
      &quot;I&#39;m alright..its just.....the Princess....&quot;
      Michiru lifted an arm from the girl&#39;s shoulder and pulled out 
her aqua mirror. &quot;&#39;Ruka..look in the mirror...&quot;
      Haruka looked into the mirror&#39;s surface and her eyes widened 
slightly. Usagi was sitting on a bench in an amusment park, licking 
her ice cream. Seiya leaned over Usagi&#39;s head and bent down, licking 
the ice cream herself. Usagi growled and shoved the girl&#39;s face back. 
However, that prooved to be a bad mistake. Seiya&#39;s knock off balance 
sent the bench, Seiya, and Usagi falling backwards. And the ice cream 
flew and Usagi&#39;s feet were sticking straight up.
      When Usagi righted herself she started to laugh. Seiya lay on 
her back with swirly eyes, the icecream cone in the center of her 
forehead, sticking out like a unicorn&#39;s horn. When Seiya sat up, she 
had to tug on the cone to get it to come off. That made Usagi fall 
into gales of laughter. Seiya started to laugh too.
      Haruka looked at Michiru over her shoulder. &quot;Its just.....I 
never pictured our princess...like....that.&quot;
      Michiru raised an eyebrow. &quot;We are like &#39;that&#39; &#39;Ruka.&quot; Haruka 
sweatdroped. &quot;I guess I&#39;m just trying to make excuses...but--&quot;
      Michiru shushed her and pointed at the mirror. &quot;&#39;Ruka look at 
her. Shes happy. If Seiya makes her happy, can you honestly say that 
she isn&#39;t right for our princess?&quot;
      Haruka looked back at the mirror. Usagi was laughing hapily. 
Haurka hadn&#39;t seen her laugh like that ever since the Starlights had 
left.
      Suddenly, the mirror clouded over and an image appeared. There 
was Sailor Moon and Star Fighter. An evil woman floated in the air 
above them. Fighter took SM&#39;s hand and pulled her behind her. The 
woman sneered and sent an attack at them. When the light cleared 
Sailor Moon and Star Fighter lay motionless on the ground, but their 
fingers were still entwined with the others, never letting go.

      When the image faded, Haruka and Michiru looked at each other. 
&quot;What in Kami&#39;s name was that....?&quot; Haruka whispered. Michiru could 
only stare at her mirror and grip her lover&#39;s hand tightly. Something 
was going to happen, the waves had changed tide....
