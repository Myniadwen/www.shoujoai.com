&#147;She&#146;s already breached the outer points of the solar system, my 
Queen, we can&#146;t stop her. Beryl&#146;s forces have already defeated the 
outer planets. The princesses are on their way here to see if they can 
help, but both Michiru and Haruka are injured. Lady Hotaru is with 
them, but she leaves her regrets to me that she may not be able to 
save them&#133;&#148; the words were spoken in a monotone voice, sending shivers 
up the Queen&#146;s spine as she watched her Guardian of time pace the 
floor, showing more emotion in the simple act of walking back and 
forth then ever seen before&#133;at least since&#133;

&#147;My Queen!&#148; the green haired Ruler of the gates snapped, fire entering 
her dark magneta eyes as she glared at the day-dreamish queen. Queen 
Serenity met the eyes of the guardian, knowing what was going to 
happen to her kingdom from earlier consul with the timekeeper, but 
still hopeful for a different destiny.

&#147;Setsuna&#133;tonight&#133;tell me what it is tonight&#133;&#148; the queen asked softly, 
causing a softened look to cross the timekeeper&#146;s face.

&#147;Tonight at midnight, the princess receives her power as your heiress. 
Tomorrow is her birthday and the time we announce her engagement to 
Prince Endyimon.&#148; Setsuna&#146;s eyes darkened once more, as if she 
remembered something that had been bothering her.

&#147;Setsuna&#133;what is it&#133;?&#148; the queen whispered, another chill creeping up 
her spine.

&#147;The princesses of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune&#133;they escaped their 
planets because&#133;My queen&#133;she&#146;s been seen once more&#133;&#148; Setsuna 
whispered, wincing as a sharp intake of breath was taken by the queen.

&#147;No&#133;Galaxia&#133;she can&#146;t be here. My daughter!&#148; the queen cried, her 
normally warm blue eyes turning an icy color, &#147;Serenity was always 
fascinated by Galaxia&#133;always loved her. I had no choice Suna! I had no 
choice!&#148;

Pluto swept the distraught woman into her arms, more to calm her, then 
to actually embrace her, whispering softly as she felt a presence 
sweep the palace searchingly, &#147;my queen, if you hadn&#146;t blocked 
Princess Serenity&#146;s memories of Galaxia, she would have abandoned her 
duties to follow the warrior. You did what you needed to do. The 
princess will marry the prince of earth. Do not fear&#133;&#148; A dark look 
crossed the timekeeper&#146;s face as she felt what she&#146;d been dreading.

Galaxia&#133;was on the moon for the first time since her exile&#133;

~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~

&#147;Serenity! Serenity where are you?!&#148;

A small giggle rose in young princess serenity&#146;s throat, causing her 
azure blue eyes to sparkle gleefully as she backed further into the 
shadows under her mother&#146;s study window, watching as four girls went 
running past her shadow-covered form. Serenity stifled another giggle 
as she watched her inner court run past her, before her eyes widened 
at the voice she heard with her mother in the study.

&#145;Suna?! Why on the moon would she go to see my mother before seeing 
me?&#146; the princess thought, partially hurt, before starting to listen 
to the conversation.

&#147;My queen, Galaxia will not touch your daughter. I will have the 
inners notified and the guards doubled. The engagement to Endyimon 
will go off without a hitch, and then we may worry about Beryl&#146;s 
forces.&#148;

&#145;What is Suna talking about&#133;? Engagement to that arrogant jerk!? NO!&#146; 
Serenity&#146;s eyes widened as reality sunk in. Her mother had told her of 
a great surprise for her birthday&#133;

A sob was torn from her lips as she flung herself away from the wall 
and dashed into the soft light of the near twilight. Her shoes seemed 
to be too loud as she dashed through the outer gardens of the palace, 
tears blinding her as she ran as fast as she could.

&#145;Marry the prince of earth? And what of Beryl? She&#146;s coming here?! 
Mother told me I was safe! Who is this Galaxia? What was Puu talking 
about?!&#146;

Thoughts raced through Serenity&#146;s head as she dashed madly toward the 
end garden of the palace, almost completely out of sight of the 
palace. Crystal clear waters of the great pond sparkled a greeting to 
her as she collapsed into a bed of soft, thornless Lunarian roses; 
sobs racking her body, as pain seemed determined to split her skull. 
Light caught on the girl&#146;s soft cascades of silver hair as she lifted 
her head to the sound of twilight bells being rung.

Gong&#133;gong&#133;gong&#133;

&#145;W&#133;.what? Those bells are never heard in the night&#133;&#146;

Gong&#133;.gong&#133;.gong&#133;

Cheering started to be heard, loud enough to reach the furthest ends 
of the garden, drowning out Serenity as she screamed in a sudden, 
searing agony, throwing back her head as bright light engulfing her 
where she lay on the soft bed of roses.

Gong&#133;gong&#133;gong&#133;

The tiny silver dot that was the birthmark on Serenity&#146;s head seemed 
to grow bigger; forming a beautiful gold crescent moon marking that 
glowed as brightly as the rest of the Moon Princess as she writhed in 
the growing agony that seemed determined to kill her&#133;

Gong&#133;gong&#133;gong&#133;

As the 12th bell was rung, the light faded, leaving Serenity lying on 
her side, gasping as the agony ebbed a bit. Her newly established 
Crescent marking still glowed painfully as her body tried to get used 
to having such a huge amount of power in it. Everything around her 
faded into an oblivion of darkness, the last thing she saw before 
blacking out were a pair of dark&#133;red&#133;eyes&#133;
