******

Setsuna kicked one of her crossed legs idly as she sat on the couch, 
waiting for &#39;them&#39; to arrive. That was the problem with being able to 
see into the future; there were rarely any surprises. Plus, Setsuna 
could hardly ever use her privileged information to aid any of her 
friends. Except this time she could bend the rules. After all, the 
coming events would involve her, so the green-haired woman had deemed it 
was within reason to use her foresight for personal purposes.

Setsuna looked down to the floor where Hotaru and Chibi-Usa were 
watching TV, dressed in their pyjamas. Chibi-Usa had come to the Outer 
Senshi residence to have a sleepover with Hotaru, which was becoming a 
near nightly occurrence. Setsuna allowed herself a small smile as she 
watched the two girls lounge about on the carpet, chatting about this 
and that with their eyes glued to the television screen. The Senshi of 
Time knew they were still merely best friends, but that would change 
eventually. Even Chibi-Usa and Hotaru themselves didn&#39;t know their own 
developing feelings for one another, but Setsuna knew what would 
eventually happen. She always knew everything, did she not?

Setsuna let out a melancholy sigh. No, she didn&#39;t know everything. The 
future streams of Time were always partially clouded, all of the 
possible paths not completely revealed to even her, the Guardian of 
Time. You would think that after a millennium of loneliness you would 
get used to being alone, used to having no one to share your life with. 
But Setsuna still wasn&#39;t used to that fact. No matter how diligently she 
had searched through the future timelines, the woman had found no 
indication that she would ever find her special someone, her true love, 
her soul mate. It seemed Setsuna was destined for an immortal existence 
filled with loneliness. She envied Rei; the girl had spat in destiny&#39;s 
face and had the courage to forge her own fate, no matter how futile it 
was. Setsuna wished she could tell Rei how the whole situation would 
play out, but that would definitely be breaking the rules. In truth, the 
Guardian of Time didn&#39;t know *exactly* how things would end, but she 
knew the crux of it all was the &#39;moment&#39;, the part of the timeline she 
couldn&#39;t see past. But what Setsuna had saw so far did not bode well for 
the miko; the Senshi of Time was beginning to regret retrieving Rei from 
Yokohama.

Setsuna snapped out of her thoughts as Hotaru and Chibi-Usa shared a 
cheerful giggle. Not all of the Sailor Senshi&#39;s fates were so grim, 
thankfully. At least, the futures of the two young girls in front of her 
could be steered away from danger by the Guardian of Time&#39;s own hand. 
The pair had conned Setsuna into letting them stay up late, even though 
it was a school night, with a variety of pouts and puppy dog 
expressions. It was safer if Chibi-Usa and Hotaru remained awake anyway; 
Setsuna had seen grisly possibilities if the girls were to be asleep in 
the Senshi of Rebirth&#146;s room when the enemy came. She had also seen her 
own death occurring tonight, but that was nothing new in itself. Setsuna 
was a Sailor Senshi, and any fight she took part in could end up with 
her being dead; it was always a possible future. She had even seen 
herself at one point tripping while crossing a road, then subsequently 
being hit by a car and killed. Having witnessed your own demise 
countless of times did tend to dull the experience, but it was still 
somewhat disturbing. Unfortunately, the coming battle would spell 
certain death for Setsuna, unless another Sailor Senshi came to her aid. 
And Setsuna couldn&#39;t afford to die; she had a duty to guard the Gates of 
Time.

The green-haired woman uncrossed her legs and sat up straighter. The 
enemy would be approaching the house very soon. &quot;Firefly, why don&#39;t you 
take Small Lady up to your room?&quot; Setsuna suggested to Hotaru.

Hotaru rolled over off her stomach and sat up, looking at the Outer 
Senshi. &quot;But Setsuna-mama, you said we could stay up,&quot; she argued 
softly.

&quot;I know I did, but I&#39;m expecting some... guests, to arrive soon,&quot; 
Setsuna explained to the pale girl.

&quot;&#39;Guests&#39;, Puu?&quot; Chibi-Usa repeated. &quot;What kinda guests? A Sailor 
Senshi?&quot;

&quot;No. Uninvited guests. Now be good girls and stay upstairs, no matter 
what you hear from down here. Do you understand?&quot; Setsuna instructed 
calmly, yet firmly.

Hotaru blinked a few times at the Guardian of Time, before looking at 
Chibi-Usa at the same moment her friend looked at her. Both girls then 
turned their gazes back to the eldest Sailor Senshi.

&quot;Alright, Setsuna-mama,&quot; Hotaru agreed obediently.

The young girl took Chibi-Usa&#39;s hand gently in her own and got to her 
feet, bringing her pink-haired companion up with her. Hotaru led her 
best friend to the stairs leading up to the second storey of the house, 
giving a last backwards glance to Setsuna, her eyes laced with worry. 
Chibi-Usa looked back and forth between the other two Sailor Senshi, 
obviously confused, but to her credit, she didn&#39;t ask any questions.

&quot;Come on, Chibi-Usa,&quot; Hotaru said, &quot;I can show you the new lamps I got.&quot;

Once the two girls footsteps faded up the stairs, Setsuna took out her 
communicator. She prayed Rei had listened to her advice to keep her own 
communicator close by, or at least told another senshi to do so. 
Setsuna&#39;s life depended on it. She swiftly tapped a few buttons to 
activate the device, opening a channel to all the Sailor Senshi bar two. 
Time was running short.

&quot;This is Sailor Pluto to all active Sailor Senshi, requesting immediate 
assistance. Multiple youma are approaching the Outer Senshi house and 
Minato General Hospital. I repeat, I require immediate assistance at the 
Outer Senshi residence,&quot; Setsuna announced quickly, then deactivated her 
communicator and put it away, not waiting for any response. There would 
be no time.

&quot;PLUTO PLANET POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

Sailor Pluto completed her transformation and whirled her Time Staff 
around in the air, before bringing it down with a bang on the floor in 
an upright position. The youma would be coming any second now. Pluto 
prayed Hotaru and Chibi-Usa remained upstairs; in nearly every future 
she had witnessed, if the girls came down to help her one or both would 
meet their end. While staying upstairs didn&#39;t absolve them from danger 
altogether, it did give them better chances of survival. Sailor Pluto 
had considered running away with the children, but she had known that 
would have been a disastrous path to take, most likely causing the 
deaths of all three of them. No, it was better to make a stand here and 
now.

Sailor Pluto exhaled slowly as the enemy cut the electricity to the 
house, making the shadows grow darker, the only light now from the 
streetlamps outside shining through the living room window. Two of the 
most powerful Sailor Senshi were residing in this house, and the 
Guardian of Time knew that neither would give in easily. But Pluto hoped 
that no less than one Sailor Senshi would come to help her, or her death 
was assured.

As a deep black mist began to form in one of the dark shadows of the 
room, Sailor Pluto once again wished she had a special someone to fight 
by her side. She didn&#39;t want to die alone, not knowing love.

******

Rei awoke all of a sudden, flicking her eyes about the dark hospital 
room. It was as if something had disturbed her slumber. She was 
surprised to feel a weight on her chest and legs, but smiled when she 
saw that it was Usagi, curled up in her lap. The two of them must have 
fallen asleep. Rei glanced at the clock on the wall. It was certainly 
late; Usagi&#39;s parents must be worried. But let them wait, the Fire 
Senshi decided as she held her only love a little closer to her with one 
arm.

Rei tenderly stroked her fingers down her princess&#39;s satin smooth cheek 
with her free hand, watching the relaxed rise and fall of the blonde&#39;s 
chest. It seemed that Usagi&#39;s nightmares had finally abated. The girl 
had told Rei days before that she still sometimes had disturbing dreams 
about her, or another senshi, being killed or mortally injured in a 
fight. Rei had been afraid that with what happened to Makoto, her 
princess&#39;s nightmares would come more frequently, but it appeared that 
Usagi was sleeping peacefully.

Rei bent down and lightly kissed the top of her true love&#39;s head, being 
careful not to wake her. The raven-haired girl breathed in the scent of 
Usagi&#39;s blonde hair, detecting the aroma of vanilla, the shampoo she no 
doubt used. For the first time in a long while, Rei was happy with her 
lot in life. Her friend Makoto was still in a critical condition and the 
miko prayed for her recovery, but the Fire Senshi was still extremely 
happy. Rei did feel slightly guilty that she could be so overjoyed while 
Ami was totally miserable and distraught with concern for Makoto, 
however. Rei had told Ami that the youma responsible for her 
girlfriend&#39;s condition had been killed, but the knowledge seemed to have 
given little comfort to the blue-haired genius. Rei suspected that her 
friend was still watching over Makoto even at this very moment. She 
wondered if Ami would skip school again. Rei deduced that Ami&#39;s mother 
must know about her daughter and Makoto&#39;s relationship by now from the 
Senshi of Water&#146;s recent actions, if the woman hadn&#146;t already 
beforehand. The miko wondered how she had taken the news.

Usagi had left to visit Mamoru earlier, but to Rei&#39;s delight, her 
princess had returned after an hour or so. And with a present for her. 
The blonde had brought Rei chocolates instead of the traditional gift of 
grapes. Usagi must have made some effort not to eat any before her 
bodyguard had received them; none of the chocolaty treats had been 
missing from their tray. Of course, that didn&#39;t stop Rei from teasing 
her love about her eating habits.

Usagi yawned and snuggled into Rei while the raven-haired girl held her, 
remaining asleep. While the Fire Senshi was debating whether to go back 
to sleep or stay awake and enjoy the feeling of her only love so close 
to her, her communicator sparked to life. Rei had taken Setsuna&#39;s advice 
to heart and had kept her communicator strapped to her wrist.

&quot;This is Pluto to all active Sailor Senshi, requesting immediate 
assistance. Multiple youma are approaching the Outer Senshi house and 
Minato General Hospital. I repeat, I require immediate assistance at the 
Outer Senshi residence,&quot; the voice from the device said.

Minato General Hospital? That was here! Rei&#146;s body tensed, the miko&#146;s 
heart rate abruptly increasing.

Another voice crackled over the communicator. &quot;This is Sailor Venus, I&#39;m 
on my way, Pluto. Pluto? Do you hear me?&quot; Minako&#39;s voice said.

&quot;This is Mercury,&quot; piped up Ami&#39;s voice, rather groggily. &quot;I&#39;m already 
at the hospital. The youma must be coming for the injured Sailor Senshi! 
I&#39;m going to stay in Jupiter&#39;s room.&quot;

&quot;I read you, Mercury,&quot; Rei replied into her communicator. &quot;Sailor Moon 
is with me. We&#39;ll go and help Neptune and Uranus.&quot;

There was silence on the communication device for an instant. &quot;Sailor 
Moon is still with you?&quot; Ami&#39;s voice then said with mild surprise. 
&quot;Alright, Mars, but be careful. I know you aren&#39;t at one hundred 
percent. I don&#39;t know how the- &quot; The senshi&#39;s image on the 
communicator&#146;s small screen as well as her voice suddenly cut off with a 
squeal of static.

Rei cursed and guessed that the signal had somehow been jammed, and then 
proceeded to bang her communicator a couple of times on the bed, as if 
the violent shock to the device would make it work.

&quot;Gah?! Whaa?&quot; Usagi groaned as her eyes fluttered open, the conversation 
between the Sailor Senshi, the squealing noise, and not to mention Rei&#146;s 
rough treatment of her watch communicator waking her up.

Usagi sat up in Rei&#39;s lap and appeared somewhat disorientated for a 
second. A small blush graced her cheeks as she looked down at her 
bodyguard&#39;s chest, where she had drooled in her sleep.

&quot;Oh... I, uh... I guess I fell asleep,&quot; Usagi said, then reddened more 
when she realised she had slept in Rei&#39;s arms.

&quot;We both did, odango atama,&quot; Rei replied easily. She rearranged her arms 
casually around her true love, one around the blonde&#39;s slender waist and 
the other over her bare legs, causing Usagi to tense slightly. Rei 
didn&#39;t notice. &quot;But we have company,&quot; the Fire Senshi continued, her 
voice turning grave, &quot;youma are coming here, to the hospital. They may 
even already be here. I&#39;d like to hope that the youma are coming to this 
place for some other reason, but I think they must have found out that 
wounded Sailor Senshi are here.&quot;

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Usagi whispered in horror, &quot;how could they find out? We have 
to guard Makoto; she&#39;s defenceless! And Michiru, and what about 
Haruka?!&quot; She broke her bodyguard&#39;s hold and slid off her lap, onto the 
floor, before whirling around to face Rei.

&quot;Where are Ami and Minako? Are they on their way here?&quot; Usagi inquired, 
all business, moving into her role as leader of the Sailor Senshi.

Rei blinked for a second at her true love&#39;s sudden change. She could 
never get used to Usagi changing from ditzy to serious so fast. &quot;Uh, Ami 
is already in Makoto&#39;s room; she&#39;s been there all day I think. Minako is 
going to help Setsuna at her house; more youma are attacking there too,&quot; 
she reported to her princess.

Usagi nodded, digesting the information. &quot;Okay. Since Ami has Makoto 
covered, we should go help Michiru and Haruka.&quot; She paused abruptly in 
her orders and looked at Rei with worry. &quot;Are you up for this? I can 
handle it alone...&quot; she said, in a much softer tone.

Rei pulled off the bed covers and swivelled her body around to face 
Usagi. She gingerly put her feet on the floor and stood up, swallowing a 
wince as her ankle ached uncomfortably. The Fire Senshi schooled her 
face to remain blank, aware that her princess was watching her carefully 
for any signs of discomfort. Rei straightened her posture and grinned 
confidently at Usagi.

&quot;I think I can take it,&quot; she said, flexing her arms experimentally and 
pretending the pain belonged to someone else.

Usagi watched Rei unsurely for a moment but then nodded her head in 
acceptance. &quot;Okay then. Let&#146;s transform,&quot; she commanded. &quot;MOON COSMIC 
POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;MARS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

Once the transformations were complete, Sailor Mars and Sailor Moon 
stealthily opened the hospital room door, and stepped out into the quiet 
hall.

******

&quot;Dead Scream,&quot; Sailor Pluto whispered, aiming her Time Staff at the 
forming mist assassin.

A huge pink energy ball was launched at the pitch-black figure, forcing 
the creature to dissipate into vapours once more. There was an enormous 
explosion as the energy ball blasted a gigantic hole in the wall, 
sending plaster and ornaments flying everywhere and allowing the night 
air to enter the now rather significantly damaged house. Michiru was not 
going to be pleased.

The Guardian of Time spun around to face a second assassin appearing out 
of another shadow. The youma&#146;s build resembled a humanoid male&#146;s while 
the creature itself was completely swathed in a mixture of loose black 
clothing: bandages, scarfs, sashes, a hooded cloak and simple plain 
strips of black material. The only skin Pluto could see on the assassin 
was a narrow slit between the dark fabrics covering its head for the 
thing&#39;s eyes. It had a sickly white complexion.

The youma moved like quicksilver, one of its black-bandaged hands 
flashing inside a sash and whipping out a throwing knife. Its arm moved 
in a blur as it threw the slender, aerodynamic weapon at Sailor Pluto. 
The Outer Senshi deftly manoeuvred her staff in an intercept course and 
deflected the blade out of the air with a metal &#39;ping&#39; sound. Just as 
Pluto was about to fire another Dead Scream attack at the knife- 
throwing assassin, the youma turned into its ethereal form, fading away 
into the shadows as if it had never even been there in the first place.

Sailor Pluto darted to her right as a small crossbow bolt whizzed by her 
side, imbedding itself in the kitchen counter behind her. She saw a 
third assassin, dressed similarly to the knife-throwing one, level its 
second small single-handed crossbow at her chest. Pluto moved on 
instinct as a serrated dagger suddenly hacked at her face from the left, 
the first youma assassin having teleported to the shadows behind her. At 
that moment the crossbow assassin fired its second bolt straight at 
Sailor Pluto. The Senshi of Time quickly smashed the butt of her staff 
into the stomach of the dagger youma, and then swung the weapon fluidly 
around to bat the bolt away from her. The sharp, barbed, projectile was 
knocked off its deadly course and ended up ripping into the fabric of 
the couch, lodging deeply its cushions. Sailor Pluto gripped her Time 
Staff horizontally with both hands, before bringing it directly upwards 
to forcefully ram under the dagger youma&#39;s chin, snapping its head back. 
She twirled her staff in her hands and then swiped at the assassin&#39;s 
legs, dropping the creature to the floor.

Sailor Pluto swivelled around to fend off another throwing knife away 
from her body, followed by another and another, her Time Staff moving 
rapidly and adeptly through the air to meet each blade.

Suddenly, it dawned on Pluto with horrifying clarity that there were 
only three... only three youma! The woman knew for a fact that the other 
two were upstairs, searching for Hotaru and Chibi-Usa. But they were 
beyond her help now.

The Guardian of Time screamed as a crossbow bolt thudded into her left 
thigh, causing her to stumble. She gritted her teeth and regained her 
footing to block a youma assassin&#39;s dagger thrust, and then lashed 
straight out with the shaft of her Time Staff in retaliation, crushing 
the dark figure&#39;s nose. The assassin reeled backwards holding its broken 
nose, black blood dripping down to the carpet.

Sailor Pluto heard a whistling sound behind her and felt a throwing 
knife lodge into her upper left shoulder blade. She collapsed to one 
knee, leaning heavily on her Time Staff, the long pole weapon the only 
thing holding her up. Pluto growled low in her throat and hastily got to 
her feet, willing new strength to her muscles, whirling around to face 
the two assassins armed with projectile weapons.

&quot;Dead Scream,&quot; she whispered, not caring that the close range between 
her and youma would cause her to be caught in the energy blast of her 
devastating attack.

A pink globe of light streaked towards the two youma, making the pair 
dive into the darkest shadows and turn into black vapours. The energy 
ball passed through the mists and blew the front door of the house apart 
far behind them, causing wooden splinters to fall like rain from above.

Sailor Pluto heard shouts from upstairs, and knew that Hotaru and 
Chibi-Usa had attacked the other assassins. She prayed for the two young 
girls&#146; safety since that was all she could do for them. At least they 
had stayed upstairs like she had asked them to. They were both such good 
girls. Pluto grunted as a crossbow bolt sliced open the right side of 
her Sailor fuku, her red blood dotting the floor. It appeared that her 
long existence was to cease. But she had to try and kill as many youma 
as she could before she fell, or there was a high likelihood that at 
least one, if not both of the young Sailor Senshi upstairs would not 
survive.

Sailor Pluto twirled her staff around and levelled it at the reforming 
youma assassins. The end was here.

******

&quot;I think I heard Puu transform,&quot; Chibi-Usa murmured, as she and Hotaru 
sat on the dark-haired girl&#39;s bed.

Hotaru looked at her friend and merely nodded. She knew something was 
going on, and it wasn&#39;t good. The Senshi of Rebirth really wanted to go 
and help her Setsuna-mama, but the woman had said to stay upstairs, in 
her room. Besides, Hotaru didn&#39;t want to leave Chibi-Usa alone.

Chibi-Usa suddenly screamed and hugged Hotaru when a huge boom shook the 
house, causing dust from the ceiling to fall in puffs to the floor. 
Hotaru looked up at the trembling ceiling apprehensively as she realised 
what the loud detonation meant. Setsuna-mama was in trouble.

&quot;What should we do, Hotaru?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked her best friend, looking to 
the pale girl for guidance.

Hotaru swallowed nervously and hugged Chibi-Usa back. &quot;We... we should 
do as Setsuna-mama says,&quot; she replied, trying to sound unafraid. Hotaru 
wasn&#39;t sure if she was convincing.

The two girls sat in the dark listening to the sounds of a struggle 
downstairs. The lights had gone out a few minutes ago and were not 
working for some reason. Chibi-Usa had said something about the power 
being out. Despite her resolve to be brave for her friend&#39;s sake, Hotaru 
was getting scared. She squeezed the pink-haired girl a little tighter 
in her arms.

&quot;Maybe we should transform,&quot; Chibi-Usa suggested.

When the Senshi of Rebirth heard her Setsuna-mama howl in agony from 
downstairs, she decided to accept her friend&#39;s suggestion. She couldn&#39;t 
sit idly by while someone she cared about was getting hurt.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Hotaru said softly, &quot;let&#39;s do it.&quot;

Chibi-Usa nodded and let go of her best friend, hopping off the bed. 
Hotaru found herself strangely missing the girl&#39;s comforting touch.

&quot;MOON PRISM POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

Hotaru stood up. &quot;SATURN PLANET POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

Just when the pair of girls completed their transformations into Sailor 
Senshi, there was another earthshaking explosion from below, causing the 
windows in the room to shudder.

&quot;We should go and help Pluto,&quot; Sailor Saturn said, beginning to walk 
towards her bedroom door. She hated to disobey Setsuna-mama, but it was 
obvious that she needed her aid.

&quot;Look out!&quot; Sailor Chibi Moon suddenly cried, pushing Saturn to the 
floor as a shiny metallic object whistled over their heads and stuck, 
wobbling, in the wall. &quot;Ahhh! Youma!&quot; Chibi Moon yelled as she dragged 
her friend to her feet with one hand, the other pointing at a figure 
with lots of black strips of cloth dangling off its body that had 
appeared in the room all of a sudden.

Sailor Saturn watched with a peculiar fascination as a dark mist began 
to appear in the corner of her room, right next to her lamp collection 
on her desk. The mist became thicker and shaped itself into a creature 
with a feminine form, dressed like the other figure. Saturn knew they 
had to be part of the group who were hurting Sailor Pluto on the ground 
floor. She levelled her Silence Glaive at the duo of youma.

&quot;I am the Senshi of Death and Rebirth, Sailor Saturn!&quot; she declared, her 
voice taking on a chill.

Sailor Chibi Moon glanced uncertainly at Saturn, and then decided to 
take her lead. &quot;And I am the Sailor of love and justice in training, 
Sailor Chibi Moon! In the name of the future moon, I will punish you!&quot; 
she shouted, glaring threateningly at the two youma. Saturn however just 
thought that the pink-haired senshi looked kind of cute.

&quot;Stay back, Saturn,&quot; Sailor Chibi Moon said seriously, &quot;leave this to 
me!&quot;

Chibi Moon flicked her wrist and a heart shaped rod appeared in her 
hands. The two youma flinched as they saw the &#39;weapon&#39;, and glanced 
uneasily at each other.

&quot;PINK SUGAR HEART ATTACK!&quot;

A line of hearts bashed into the male youma&#39;s chest, causing him to take 
a step back and look down at the pink barrage with mild concern. The 
heart stream ended after a few seconds, with the assassin remaining 
unharmed. Sailor Chibi Moon looked crest-fallen. Saturn decided that her 
friend really needed some new attacks.

Sailor Saturn could just imagine the smirks under the two youma&#39;s ebony 
scarves. The female assassin drew a long, wicked curved knife, the edge 
of the blade dripping with a clear fluid. Saturn hoped it wasn&#39;t poison 
or something. The other youma assassin drew three short and thin knives, 
each blade held between the fingers on one black-clad hand.

&quot;Get behind me, Chibi Moon,&quot; Saturn commanded, her voice stern and 
frosty as she glowered at the enemy warily.

&quot;No, it&#39;s too dan- ahh!&quot; Sailor Chibi Moon&#39;s stubborn refusal was cut 
off as Sailor Saturn roughly pulled the girl behind her with one hand, 
at the same second three throwing knives were hurled through the air at 
the pair.

Saturn struck out with her Glaive three times, being careful not to clip 
Chibi-Moon behind her with the long weapon. The two assassin&#39;s eyes 
widened as the three knives all landed on the floor, a couple of feet in 
front of their intended targets. The youma looked at each other once 
again, and then in silent agreement, began to spread out to either side 
of Saturn cautiously.

The Senshi of Death spun her Silence Glaive around her head and prepared 
to defend against another attack.

******

&quot;Why is it so dark in here?&quot; Sailor Moon whined as she and Sailor Mars 
made their way down the hall.

&quot;The power must be cut,&quot; Mars whispered back. &quot;The back up generator 
only takes care of critical areas like operating theatres and such. 
Hallway lights must be low priority.&quot;

There were still nurses on night shift duty, which Sailor Mars and 
Sailor Moon had to avoid. It wouldn&#39;t do to let the hospital staff 
destroy the element of surprise they had on the approaching youma.

&quot;You&#39;re not afraid of the dark are you, odango atama?&quot; the Fire Senshi 
teased her princess.

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Sailor Moon denied, &quot;it&#39;s just that you never know what 
can jump out of the darkness.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Mars cooed soothingly, &quot;I&#39;ll protect you from the boogie 
monster.&quot;

Sailor Moon merely muttered something about annoying girls in response.

The two Sailors eventually made it to the hallway&#146;s intersection, both 
stopping at the junction as realisation hit them. One way led to 
Michiru&#39;s room, and the other to Haruka&#39;s room. Sailor Mars really 
didn&#39;t want to leave her princess. Sailor Moon also hesitated for a 
moment, not looking entirely sure what to do. The blonde then shook her 
head slightly, her long tresses swinging.

&quot;I&#39;ll go to Haruka,&quot; she said, &quot;you can go to Michiru.&quot;

Sailor Mars simply stood there, putting the majority of her weight on 
her good foot as she mulled over the situation. Setsuna had said the 
&#39;moment&#39; when Sailor Moon&#39;s life would be in certain danger would most 
likely occur at night. Mars couldn&#39;t afford to abandon her love&#146;s side. 
The Fire Senshi looked at Sailor Moon anxiously, her mouth halfway open 
as the tried to think of an excuse to stay near the blonde.

&quot;Rei...&quot; Sailor Moon sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

Sailor Mars continued to stare at her true love, looking not one bit 
convinced.

&quot;Come on, Rei. Michiru might need your help. You can&#39;t let her down,&quot; 
Sailor Moon argued.

Mars cursed under her breath. She knew her princess was right. But damn 
it, she didn&#39;t have to like it. &quot;Alright,&quot; the Senshi of Fire 
reluctantly conceded.

Sailor Moon nodded and then gave her bodyguard a bright, reassuring 
smile. Before Mars&#39; true love turned to go down the other hallway, the 
miko wrapped her arms around the girl&#39;s waist and pulled her close, 
causing her to let out faint squeak of protest.

&quot;Rei, we shouldn&#39;t-&quot; Sailor Moon started.

Sailor Mars silenced her with a passionate kiss, making the blonde 
girl&#39;s cheeks turn pink. Sailor Moon struggled weakly in her bodyguard&#39;s 
embrace, but it was a token effort and she quickly gave in to the kiss, 
returning it with equal vigour and folding her arms around Mars&#39; neck.

After several long, pleasure-filled seconds, Sailor Mars ended the kiss. 
She looked deeply into Sailor Moon&#146;s eyes, as if willing her to remain 
safe. &quot;Be careful... my princess,&quot; she whispered softly.

Sailor Moon stared back and stopped breathing, merely nodding her head 
slowly in response. After a second, the blonde came to her senses and 
left Mars&#39; embrace. She stepped backwards, giving her bodyguard one last 
look, then turned around and jogged as quietly as she could in the 
direction of Haruka&#39;s hospital room. Sailor Mars watched her go for a 
moment, before turning to head towards Michiru&#39;s room.

******

The closer Sailor Mars got to Michiru&#39;s room, the more her instincts 
flared up, causing adrenaline to pump through her veins faster and 
faster. The only thing Mars could hear was her own slow, controlled 
breathing. She couldn&#39;t shake the nagging feeling that Sailor Moon would 
somehow be horrifically injured, all because Sailor Mars wasn&#39;t there to 
protect her. She shook her head and mentally chastised herself. It 
wasn&#146;t like Sailor Moon was some helpless damsel in distress.

Sailor Mars&#39; gaze snapped to a closed door on the far right side of the 
hallway as she heard a weak cry come from within. There was a loud 
splashing sound and Mars noticed water leaking out into the hall from 
under the door. Michiru needed her help.

The Fire Senshi ran as best she could with her aching ankle towards 
Michiru&#39;s door, and then barged it open with her shoulder, flinging the 
door back to bang against the wall. She quickly took stock of the 
situation. There were two black-clad figures inside, both humanoid, but 
Sailor Mars noted that one had a long thin tail erupting through its 
ebony wrappings from its behind. At first glance, the miko thought they 
were ninjas or something, but the vibes she was getting off the pair 
told her they were not human. Sailor Neptune was in one corner of the 
room, leaning heavily against the wall and taking laboured breaths while 
clutching at her stomach with one arm. She clearly still hadn&#39;t 
recovered from her previous wounds and would no doubt be of little 
assistance. It was all up to Sailor Mars.

&quot;Hey, you two!&quot; she called out as she appeared in the doorway, causing 
all heads in the room to turn to her. &quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

A fireball launched from Sailor Mars&#39; fingertips, detonating on the back 
of one of the youma, causing its clothes to burst into flames. The 
assassin staggered about the room, waving its arms wildly in some sort 
of attempt to dispel the flames. The remaining assassin with the tail 
spun around and slashed low at Mars with a dagger. The Inner Senshi 
sucked in her stomach and angled her body away from the blow, letting 
the attack harmlessly pass her by. Mars delivered a counterattack, 
ramming her palm directly into the assassin&#39;s face. She followed 
smoothly with a punch to its stomach, doubling the youma over, and then 
chopped at the back of its neck. The assassin keeled over, falling flat 
on its face on the floor. Sailor Mars shook her still-injured hands 
painfully, her knuckles throbbing.

Mars glanced at Neptune and saw her look back in gratitude, offering her 
saviour a shaky smile. The miko turned her attention to the burning 
youma, only to see it partially disappear in a cloud of black mist. 
However, the creature swiftly reformed, its flaming clothes somehow 
detrimentally affecting its metamorphosis.

The blazing assassin collapsed to the floor, burnt alive, the youma 
having been unable to quell the inferno eating away at its body.

&quot;Behind you!&quot; Sailor Neptune suddenly warned.

Sailor Mars moved on reflex, diving forward over Neptune&#146;s hospital bed 
and rolling on the other side just as several throwing knives embedded 
themselves in the wall in front of her.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Sailor Mars stood up from behind the bed, her burning bow drawn and 
ready to let loose hot, fiery death at the assassin. But instead, all 
she saw was a slight trace of black vapours.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Mars cursed, letting her bow fade away.

Sailor Mars heard a gasp from Sailor Neptune and hurriedly turned to the 
Outer Senshi. Mars eyes widened as the youma materialised behind 
Neptune, where the woman was leaning in a dark corner of the room. The 
assassin put a jagged blade to the senshi&#39;s exposed throat.

&quot;No, MICHIRU!!&quot;

Mars&#146; eyes flicked to the doorway for a second and saw that Sailor 
Uranus and Sailor Moon were standing there, the blonde Outer Senshi 
looking on in sheer horror at the events unfolding. Sailor Mars had to 
do something; she was closest and had the only chance to save Sailor 
Neptune&#146;s life.

The youma assassin&#39;s eyes narrowed and its hand holding the blade 
tensed, causing both Sailor Uranus and Sailor Moon to cry out. Mars had 
to act now. She gave a quick prayer to any god who was listening to 
guide her hand, and then reached behind her while keeping her eyes on 
the enemy, moving like lightening and plucking one of the throwing 
knives out of the wall. In one fluid motion, Sailor Mars hurled the 
sharp weapon at the youma, the blade stabbing the creature through its 
left eyeball and piercing its brain in a heartbeat. Sailor Neptune eased 
the assassin&#39;s knife away from her throat and let the creature&#146;s body 
slide down the wall. She then let out the breath she had been holding.

&quot;Oh, thank god, Michiru!&quot; Uranus cried, stumbling over to the 
aquamarine-haired woman and pulling her into a close but gentle embrace, 
being careful not to aggravate her lover&#39;s injuries.

Sailor Mars limped away from the couple towards the door, letting them 
have their private moment. Sailor Moon caught her still wounded 
bodyguard by the upper arms, supporting her. Mars smirked rakishly at 
her princess.

&quot;I take it all is well at your side of things?&quot; she inquired.

Sailor Moon nodded, glancing at Uranus and Neptune then back at Mars. 
&quot;There were two youma near Uranus&#39; room, just like those two,&quot; she said 
gesturing with her head at the remains of the torched assassin. &quot;Both 
moon dusted.&quot;

Sailor Mars lowered her head, relieved that Sailor Moon appeared to be 
unharmed. The Fire Senshi&#39;s head then abruptly shot up and her eyes 
widened. &quot;What about Mercury and Makoto?&quot; she asked anxiously.

Sailor Moon met her concerned gaze with one of her own, obviously having 
forgotten about the other two senshi. As if on cue, both Sailor Moon&#39;s 
and Sailor Mars&#39; communicators crackled to life.

&quot;This is Sailor Mercury; is anybody listening?&quot; came Mercury&#39;s voice 
over the devices.

&quot;We read you loud and clear, Sailor Mercury,&quot; Uranus said behind Mars, 
speaking into her own watch communicator, the relief obvious in her 
voice. &quot;All four of us are perfectly fine.&quot; Sailor Uranus gazed deeply 
into Sailor Neptune&#39;s eyes as she spoke, holding the woman around the 
waist delicately.

&quot;Good...&quot; Mercury said over the communicators, her image looking glad. 
&quot;Jupiter and I are alright. There was only one youma and it was taken 
care of. The communicator jamming has seemed to have stopped also, 
however I can&#39;t get in contact with Venus or Pluto.&quot;

&quot;Oh no... maybe I should go and help,&quot; Sailor Moon suggested. &quot;They 
could be in big trouble!&quot;

&quot;Maybe...&quot; said Sailor Mars, &quot;but by the time you make it to Haruka and 
Michiru&#39;s house it&#39;ll probably be too late to do anything to help.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s right, Sailor Moon,&quot; Mercury&#39;s voice said over the 
communicator, &quot;we&#39;ll just have to hope for the best. We really do owe 
our lives to Sailor Pluto, without her warning things may have turned 
out a lot worse.&quot; Sailor Mars saw Sailor Mercury&#39;s image on her watch 
communicator look over her shoulder to something in the background, no 
doubt the critically injured Makoto.

Sailor Mercury was right; things could have been a lot worse. Without 
Pluto&#39;s warning, it was highly likely all of the Sailor Senshi in Minato 
General Hospital would have been murdered in their sleep. Mars shivered 
at the thought, imagining her princess stabbed through the back or with 
her throat slit. On impulse, the Fire Senshi drew Sailor Moon into a 
hug. The blonde squirmed a little, probably scared that Uranus and 
Neptune would think the gesture was something more than just friendly. 
Sailor Mars didn&#39;t care though, she just had to hold the girl. She was 
in Sailor Pluto&#39;s debt for the woman&#39;s actions. Without the Senshi of 
Time, Sailor Mars&#39; true love could have been hurt or even killed.

&quot;Rei...&quot; Sailor Moon sighed, giving in to her bodyguard&#39;s loving embrace 
and circling the raven-haired girl&#146;s waist lightly with her arms.

Sailor Mars rested her head on her princess&#39;s shoulder. She heard 
footsteps coming closer, probably the night-shift hospital staff. They 
would all have to detransform soon, but right now the miko just wanted 
to remain embracing Sailor Moon. The Fire Senshi hoped that Sailor Pluto 
was all right. She had a rather large &#39;thank you&#39; to give the Guardian 
of Time.

******

Sailor Pluto desperately swung her staff at a crossbow bolt, the 
projectile ricocheting off the metal pole to fly across the room. Blood 
was seeping from Pluto&#39;s multiple stab wounds and lacerations, but she 
would still live. For now. However, the Senshi of Time knew that the 
mortal blow from one of her foes was coming soon and that she wouldn&#39;t 
be fast enough to prevent or evade it.

Sailor Pluto whirled around and dropped into a crouch, sweeping at the 
legs of an assassin armed with a dagger with her Time Staff. The youma 
nimbly leapt over the staff and brought its weapon downwards with both 
hands, attempting to impale the woman&#39;s head. Pluto swiftly thrust 
upwards with her staff, catching the assassin in the throat hard and 
crushing its windpipe. She then stood up and slammed the lower end of 
her weapon in the youma&#39;s side, hearing the crack of ribs breaking.

The Guardian of Time turned around as fast as she could, flicking a 
throwing knife out of its lethal flight path with her staff. She 
followed the move by jamming the butt of her pole weapon in the stomach 
of the youma behind her, causing the fatally wounded creature to 
collapse into a ball on the floor.

Sailor Pluto noticed that the assassin with the crossbows had abandoned 
its two weapons, apparently out of ammunition. The youma darted into a 
shadow and vanished in a cloud of black mist. The blow would be coming 
now.

Meanwhile the only other youma assassin still on its feet pulled out 
three throwing knives in each hand and threw all six blades at the 
doomed Outer Senshi, the yellow streetlight reflecting off the polished 
metal of the projectiles as they flew through the air. Sailor Pluto let 
out a defiant cry and moved as gracefully and quickly as she could in 
her wounded state, forcing all of the knives away from her in six 
perfect strokes of her Time Staff. She could sense the other assassin 
materialising behind her, its long notched dagger about to plunge into 
her back and scrape her heart, spelling death for the Guardian of Time. 
Pluto could almost feel the cold steel slip under her skin and sink deep 
into her flesh, her life spilling in red torrents to the floor. The 
eldest Sailor Senshi spun around to try and stop the finishing stab, 
nevertheless knowing that her efforts were useless. She wouldn&#39;t be fast 
enough. Sailor Pluto had already foreseen all of these events happening.

&quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot;

The youma assassin howled in torment as its hand was suddenly severed at 
the wrist, its fist rolling along the floor still holding on to its 
notched dagger. Sailor Pluto and the knife throwing youma&#39;s heads turned 
towards the Guardian of Time&#39;s saviour, the person who had dragged the 
woman away from the jaws of Death. Pluto blinked at Sailor Venus 
standing in the Dead Scream hole in the house&#146;s wall. So this was how 
things turned out. Sailor Pluto had begun to think that a senshi 
wouldn&#39;t ever come to her aid, but here one was, and it was Venus.

The Senshi of Love winked at Pluto, flashing a V symbol with the fingers 
of one hand. &quot;Never fear, V-babe&#39;s here!&quot; she cried out 
enthusiastically.

The one-handed youma continued to scream in excruciating pain, staring 
at the charred stump where its hand used to be in disbelief. Sailor 
Pluto used the last of her depleting strength to smash the stunned 
assassin in the side of the head with her Time Staff, abruptly cutting 
off its shrieks. The youma&#39;s skull caved in, drenching the Garnet Orb in 
bloody black gore and sending brain matter and bone shards into the air 
like confetti.

Sailor Pluto fell to her knees, her grip sliding down the blood-slick 
shaft of her Time Staff. Her eyes went to Sailor Venus. The remaining 
youma assassin hurled a knife at the blonde girl, causing the 
experienced senshi to agilely dodge to the side. Venus glanced at 
Pluto&#39;s heavily wounded form then back at the assassin, the look in her 
eyes showing that she was obviously ready to give it some payback on the 
woman&#146;s behalf.

&quot;LOVE ME CHAIN!&quot;

The youma threw another spinning blade at Sailor Venus, but the Senshi 
of Love lashed out with an energy beam of hearts, snagging the blade out 
of its course and holding it on the end of the heart whip. Venus then 
brutally cracked her chain, letting the knife end rip into the youma and 
tear open its neck, severing the artery in an obscene display of 
showering black blood. The creature clutched at its neck and fell 
backwards to the floor, its life pumping out from between its fingers. 
It wouldn&#39;t get up again.

Sailor Pluto lowered her head in relief, putting all of her weight on 
her staff as she knelt on the floor. Sailor Venus ran to the Guardian of 
Time&#39;s side, reaching out a hand but then pulling it back, afraid to 
touch the terribly hurt senshi, a myriad of bolts and knives lodged all 
over her body.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Setsuna,&quot; Venus said with concern in her tone, &quot;I&#39;ll call 
an ambulance. Maybe you can stay in the same hospital Michiru and Haruka 
are at,&quot; she finished with a slight grin.

&quot;No... time,&quot; Pluto replied, smiling faintly at the reference, &quot;for that 
right now. Hotaru and Chibi-Usa are upstairs... they need help...&quot; She 
rested her forehead against her Time Staff and took deep, controlled 
breaths.

Sailor Venus hesitated for a second but then got to her feet. &quot;Okay, but 
you better still be breathing when I come back,&quot; she ordered. &quot;Don&#39;t 
make me have to punish you in the name of Venus!&quot; The blonde gave a 
rather strained, playful smile down at the Guardian of Time.

&quot;We can&#39;t have that...&quot; murmured Sailor Pluto.

Venus nodded in satisfaction and then hurried up the stairs.

******

&quot;SILENCE WALL!&quot;

Sailor Saturn held her Glaive horizontally over her head with both 
hands, forming a force field around herself and Sailor Chibi Moon. The 
female youma assassin&#39;s poison dagger slash and the volley of throwing 
knives from her companion deflected off the invisible wall. Both the 
youma melted into the shadows once again and reformed in different spots 
around the room.

The fight had gone on for some time and Saturn was getting rather tired. 
She only had her Silence Glaive to fight with, since her other attacks 
would most likely kill her and Sailor Chibi Moon, and perhaps even 
Sailor Pluto downstairs. Having only a close combat weapon was a serious 
disadvantage. Sailor Saturn was sure she could maybe rush the knife 
throwing youma and cut him down before slaughtering his ally in the same 
breath, but that would leave Sailor Chibi Moon open for attack by the 
other youma, and the Senshi of Death and Rebirth couldn&#39;t let the 
pink-haired girl get hurt.

The Silence Wall dropped and another throwing knife flashed towards 
Saturn&#39;s head. The girl whipped around and knocked the flying blade away 
with her Glaive, stopping the projectile from harming her. But Sailor 
Saturn couldn&#39;t keep this up forever, and Sailor Chibi Moon had no 
useful powers to help in the fight.

Saturn twirled her deadly weapon in her grasp and blocked a wide swipe 
from the female assassin. One hit from the creature&#146;s knife and the pale 
girl would be history for sure.

&quot;PINK SUGAR HEART ATTACK!&quot;

Sailor Saturn glanced behind her and saw that Sailor Chibi Moon had 
fired a salvo of hearts into the knife throwing assassin&#39;s eyes, 
temporarily blinding him. Maybe Saturn&#39;s best friend did possess a 
useful power after all.

Saturn gasped in surprise as the female youma darted past her Glaive and 
stabbed at her neck with her knife. The Senshi of Death intentionally 
tripped and fell backwards onto the floor, trying to avoid the killing 
blow. But her opponent was too close and had already breached her 
defences. The assassin raised her knife and thrust downwards at the 
prone Sailor Saturn. The girl&#39;s eyes widened as she watched the poisoned 
blade&#146;s descent helplessly.

&quot;Hotaru!&quot; Sailor Chibi Moon cried, before diving into the youma 
assassin, pushing the creature away from her best friend.

The female assassin recovered swiftly and smashed the bottom of her 
dagger on the back of Chibi Moon&#39;s head, knocking the girl unconscious. 
She picked up her pink-haired prize and then proceeded to dash towards 
the window.

&quot;Noooo!! Let her go!!&quot; Sailor Saturn yelled, using her Silence Glaive to 
stand up.

The youma ignored the Senshi of Rebirth&#39;s heartfelt cry and leapt 
through the window, breaking through the glass and disappearing from 
sight.

&quot;NO!&quot; Saturn screamed again.

Sailor Saturn ran towards the window and watched in horror as the 
assassin darted nimbly across the street with the dark-haired girl&#39;s 
best friend in her grasp. This couldn&#39;t be happening. Tears began to 
form in the Senshi of Rebirth&#39;s lilac eyes.

Sailor Saturn heard a sound from the remaining youma behind her. Without 
thinking Saturn twisted around and cleaved upwards with her Silence 
Glaive, gutting the assassin from groin to throat, his insides dropping 
to the floor in a sickening display while black blood splattering high 
to hit the ceiling. Saturn spun completely around and chopped at the 
creature&#39;s throat, half severing his head. The youma&#39;s head hung 
backwards by a shred of flesh, black liquid spilling out from seemingly 
everywhere. Mercifully, the assassin&#39;s life was snuffed out quickly, and 
it fell to the floor in a quivering heap beside the pile of its own 
internal organs.

&quot;Hotaru?&quot; an uneasy voice said from the doorway to the Senshi of Death&#146;s 
bedroom.

Sailor Saturn looked up from the grisly corpse to see Sailor Venus 
standing at the entrance of her room. Saturn&#39;s bottom lip shook and she 
let her Silence Glaive drop to the floor with a heavy clatter. More 
tears poured down her pale, black blood covered cheeks, creating trails 
in the stains. The young girl simply stood there, her arms by her sides.

&quot;Sh-She took h-her,&quot; Saturn sobbed, her chest heaving. &quot;She took 
Chibi-Usa!!&quot;
