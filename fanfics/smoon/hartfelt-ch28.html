<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 28 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><p><u>(Nightfall, Setsuna, Entrance to the City)</u></p><p>Setsuna stood in front of the 
entrance of the city, still remaining motionless in silent thought as she observed the 
glowing city before her. Since the night fell, the city began to emit the white light again 
like the previous nights after its miraculous restoration. However, there was a dark and 
serious expression on the former advisor’s face.</p><p>Behind her she heard footsteps. She 
didn’t need to look to know who the presence belonged to.</p><p>“Luna. What do I owe the 
pleasure of this visit?” She calmly remarked. Behind her, the vice advisor stepped out of 
the shadows.</p><p>“Artemis informed me of the situation today. I heard that we need a 
‘miracle’ if we expect to stand a chance in the upcoming war. Is this true?” She studied her 
companion, but Setsuna maintained her silence.</p><p>Even after all of these centuries, she 
still looked detached as ever. It angered her.</p><p>“Would you put their lives at stake to 
satisfy your own ambitions?” She growled. “Or have you forgotten your duty and are now 
acting as his personal spy?”</p><p>The air around the women grew tense. However, Setsuna did 
not try and refute her comrade’s accusations. She continued to remain motionless, leaving 
her back open to the vice advisor.</p><p>“Her Majesty Queen Serenity had always favoured 
you. She trusted you with all her heart, even with the knowledge that you abandoned her 
brother. While I concede that Apollo was a poor leader, I’ve always found it suspicious how 
you suddenly switched sides. It appeared that you had no such inclination before. What made 
you change your mind? Also, when Lady Hotaru mysteriously went missing... wasn’t she 
supposed to be under your watch, Setsuna?”</p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb.</b></i></p><p>“In the 
Kingdom, it was rumoured that you had an unusually strong gift when it came to premonitions 
and spiritual searches. If that was true, then why didn’t you locate Lady Hotaru’s presence 
after she went missing? Why, didn’t you foresee our Kingdom’s destruction...?” Her voice was 
beginning to crack with emotion. “Or...Did you see it, and just decide not to tell 
us?!”</p><p><i>Setsuna!</i></p><p><i><b>DOOM</b></i></p><p>Crimson eyes dimmed. <i>Is it my 
fault?</i></p><p>“…Perhaps… it was my fault.” She whispered. “If I had been stronger, then 
perhaps things would have been clearer.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I am only able to 
predict possibilities of the future. However, when it came to the Moon Kingdom, its future 
was always clouded. I could not clearly discern its destruction much less the cause of it. 
It was the same for Lady Hotaru. However, you were...absolutely correct. The young Lady was 
placed under my watch, and I’ve failed Her Majesty. I failed all of you, and for that, you 
have my sincerest apologies.”</p><p>Luna watched the woman finally turn around, and saw raw 
emotion in her red eyes. “Do you truly believe... that I feel no regret or remorse for what 
has happened?”</p><p>This time, Luna did not answer her.</p><p>“I have no intention of 
sacrificing their lives. They will be given a fighting chance.”</p><p>Her comrade was almost 
convinced by the promising tone, but at the same time it made her feel 
uneasy.</p><p>“How...?” Luna finally asked.</p><p>“As you already know, one’s spiritual 
capacity... particularly that of a God or Goddess, naturally increases over time as the 
individual ages. The source of our spiritual power stems from the accumulation of 
experience. However, as I have already mentioned to Artemis, the time factor is against us 
in this fight. Thus, we will require another means of increasing their spiritual 
capacity.”</p><p>“But without time...” She gasped. “You intend to force their limits back!” 
Suddenly, it made sense. “That’s an extremely dangerous plan Setsuna. Not only would you 
need to amass a large amount of spiritual energy, but the shock to their systems may be 
enough to kill them!”</p><p>“There is no other way.” Setsuna brought her garnet staff down, 
and startled her comrade. “If we send them into battle the way they are now, even with 
Planet Power, they will inevitably fall. All of them and their people...will perish.” There 
was a dark look in her eyes as she said this, and it frightened the other 
woman.</p><p>“But—still! How do you intend to amass the spiritual power necessary to perform 
the process?”</p><p>Setsuna was silent. Luna’s eyes then trailed up to the lit up city 
behind the woman, and she felt her heart skip a beat.</p><p><i>It can’t be...</i></p><p>“But 
that’s...”</p><p>“If anyone should be the one to dirty their hands, then it should be me. I 
will shoulder the responsibility.”</p><p>“Setsuna...”</p><p>In a quiet voice she asked, “If 
it’s not too much to ask, would you please awaken the young ones and gather them 
here?”</p><p>“Right now?!”</p><p>“Yes. After some careful investigation, I have concluded 
that our time frame for this operation is possibly only during the night. During the day, 
these energies become dormant and are inaccessible. I would like to get this over with as 
soon as possible, if that is all right with you.”</p><p>“...All right. I will go and summon 
them now. You understand that they might be cranky though, so don’t go blaming me when they 
yell at you,” Luna said as turned to leave. As she walked away from the area, she whispered 
under her breath,</p><p>“I just hope that you know what you’re doing...”</p><p><u>(Entrance 
to the City)</u></p><p>Sometime later, all of the young women had been gathered at the 
City’s gate where Setsuna had been patiently waiting. The former advisor calmly watched as 
the sleepy and confused expressions gave way to nervousness. Although they were standing 
outside of the city, at its limits, the influence of the spiritual force that resided within 
it was still very strong. It was very evident in that all of the young women had turned a 
deathly pale.</p><p><i>What is this feeling?</i> Minako tried to hug herself for warmth, but 
the chill persisted. <i>It feels like, something is trying to pull me inside. 
</i></p><p>Everyone else felt the pull as well, Rei—in particular. Even Luna and Artemis 
appeared to be somewhat guarded.</p><p>“I don’t like the feeling I’m getting from this 
place. Why are we here anyway?” Haruka crankily muttered. She had almost gotten to sleep 
when Luna came and woke her. “What do you make of it 
Michiru?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Michiru...?”</p><p>When the Goddess finally spoke, her voice 
was heavy with emotion. There was a distant look in her eyes.</p><p>“I sense... multiple 
energies residing within this place. But their signatures are faint and weak. They are only 
remnants of what they once were.”</p><p>“Huh?! Y-You mean there are ghosts in there?!” 
Beside Haruka, Hotaru looked uneasy.</p><p>“Yes, I suspect so. Unlike a person’s spiritual 
trail, these ones do not fade with time. During the daytime they remain dormant. But as soon 
as night falls it appears that they take upon the form of glowing lights, such as what we 
are seeing now. For some reason they appear to be particularly restless tonight. It’s as 
though… something has disturbed them.”</p><p>“Yeesh.” Just thinking about it was giving 
Haruka the creeps. “Well, as long as they stay in there then I don’t care.” <i>Really, I 
just want to get some sleep.</i> <i>Is that too much to ask? </i>“Hey, Setsuna! So it looks 
like you’re finally done resting, huh? Anyway, why did you drag us out here in the middle of 
the night? If we were going to have another meeting or something, couldn’t it have waited 
until the morning?”</p><p>Setsuna shook her head. “By morning, it would have been too 
late.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“I had summoned you all here for the purpose of conducting your 
final task.”</p><p>It took a few seconds before the words registered to the tired blonde. 
Haruka scratched her head in confusion.</p><p>“Final task...?” She didn’t like the sound of 
that. Anything that didn’t involve ‘back to bed’ was terrible in her opinion. “What do you 
mean by that? Please tell me you seriously didn’t wake us up in the middle of the night just 
to conduct another training exercise!”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>The woman’s bluntness was 
beginning to annoy her. Haruka could feel a headache coming on, and this damn cold wasn’t 
helping in the least.</p><p>“And it can’t wait until morning because...?”</p><p>“Because the 
conditions required for this exercise can only be met during the night.” She said 
simply.</p><p>“Oh. N-No! I mean, why are we out here exactly?! Like, okay, I get that you 
want us to do something out here, but what? Is this supposed to be another lesson or 
something? Because I thought we already learned everything that we needed to know. Weren’t 
we supposed to keeping practicing against each other until we were ready?”</p><p>“If we did 
that, then you would never be ready in time.” The remark seemed to throw her for a loop. 
“After observing your progress over this past week, it has become apparent that you are all 
severely lacking in spiritual power. This is a critical inhibition that must be corrected as 
quickly as possible.”</p><p>Haruka twitched. “Grr...Funny how that’s coming from someone 
who’s been in bed all week,” she retorted. “Look! We’ve been working our butts off to get 
stronger! We’ve been doing everything that you’ve told us to do! If that isn’t good enough, 
then why don’t <i>you </i>do something about it?!”</p><p>“I will concede that you are all 
stronger now than when you had first arrived. However, it is still not enough. Before you 
interrupt me again, please allow me to put it into perspective. Today, despite your 
additional growth due to Planet Power, your team was unable to defeat Artemis in a training 
exercise. Keeping this in mind, the enemy that you will face is stronger than Luna, Artemis 
<i>and</i> myself combined. It took all of your predecessors to defeat him the last time. Do 
you believe that, as a group, you currently rival their strength? If you were to engage in 
combat with the enemy at this instant, do you truly believe that you can 
win?”</p><p>“W-Well...”</p><p>“This is something that all of you need to understand. This 
has nothing to do with spite, but rather the reality of things. The outcome of this battle 
falls squarely upon your shoulders. Out of every individual on your planets, you are the 
only ones that can be considered a threat to Apollo. If you should fail, then countless of 
lives will be lost.” She met Haruka’s eyes. “I understand that you may be tired, but the 
enemy will not wait and allow you to rest. It is times like these that we must remain 
diligent, and strive forward the hardest.”</p><p>There was a pained look on the blonde’s 
face, but she didn’t protest.</p><p>“So basically...What you’re saying is that we need to 
increase our spiritual powers.” Rei stepped forward. “How do you propose that we do that? 
Correct me if I’m wrong but somehow I have a feeling that it involves this 
place.”</p><p>Setsuna returned the knowing gaze with a nod. “Correct.” This drew looks of 
disbelief from the others. “There are several of ways to increase one’s spiritual capacity. 
One of them, if you recall what I said to Uranus, can be developed through years of 
training. The second... arises only when a human ascends to a God or Goddess rank. However, 
given the circumstances, none of these options are available to us. Therefore there is only 
one option remaining.”</p><p>“And that would be?”</p><p>“Theoretically, the limits of one’s 
spiritual capacity expand as the individual acquires more spiritual energy. If you absorb a 
vast amount of energy at once, then it may be possible to significantly expand your 
limits.”</p><p>“I see.” Ami wondered aloud. “So, to become stronger, we need to break our 
current limits and create new ones. Like you said, it theoretically makes sense. But 
considering the improvement that you expect of us, and factoring in the amount energy it 
would take for each of us to surpass our current limits...we would need...”</p><p>“An entire 
city’s worth.” Michiru finished.</p><p>The glowing structures behind Setsuna’s back suddenly 
drew everyone’s attention. It couldn’t be, could it?</p><p>“That is precisely it. What I 
propose... is that you absorb the energy contained within this city and use it to expand 
your limits.”</p><p><b>DOOM!</b></p><p>“A-Are you serious...?! But how can you expect us to 
do something like that?!” Makato stammered in disbelief. “Michiru just said that those 
lights, or energies, or whatever are, are actually people! We can’t just absorb them... even 
if it’s to increase our powers!”</p><p>The last words were followed by a deadly silence and 
Setsuna felt the intense stares from both sides. After a few seconds, she shook her head and 
pointed to the city.</p><p>“Look there. The majority of the energy that you see before you 
is ‘free energy’, or alternatively known as the ‘energy of life’. It exists 
everywhere--within the plants, air and the very ground that we walk upon. As the term 
implies, it is free energy because it is unattached to a particular being. However, 
according to a law of energy... that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but transformed 
from one form to another... through this, the soul may be born. The soul is a special 
aggregate of this free energy, a variation if you will. Imagine this comparison in colors. 
Free energy is white and the soul is green. Both are colors, but they are not the same.” She 
paused. This was the conclusion everyone had been waiting for. “What I am asking of you is 
not to assimilate another soul into yours, but this free energy.”</p><p>The tension in the 
atmosphere eased greatly. Setsuna could have sworn that she heard a few sighs of relief as 
well.</p><p>“Hmmm… well, when you put it that way, I guess it’s okay?” Makoto said. “But to 
be honest, I still don’t want to go in there. Is there any way we can do whatever you want 
us to do out here?”</p><p>“Given the time it will take for you to accomplish the session, I 
think it would be unwise to alter the conditions now. We would like for you to finish as 
soon as possible.”</p><p>“Oh...”</p><p>“If there are no more questions, I will explain the 
task to you.” She waited, but no one spoke up. “...Very well. This training session will be 
split up into two tasks. In various areas of the city, I have placed eight spheres of my 
energy. For clarification, this means one sphere per person. Your first task is this: Locate 
one of the spheres and activate it. Each of these spheres has been modified so that they 
will attract the free energy in the surrounding area upon activation. Once the energy has 
been gathered, take it inside of yourself. That will mark the end of the first task. Are 
there any questions so far?”</p><p>“Wait. I have a question.” Haruka interrupted. “You said 
that you placed them in various parts of the city, right? Then wouldn’t it take forever for 
all of us to find them all?”</p><p>“Whether you choose to move as a group or individually, 
it is up to you. However, the sooner you complete the tasks, the sooner you will be able to 
leave. That is all the advice I can offer.”</p><p><i>Hmph. So she wants us to split 
up...</i> Haruka thought. It wasn’t so much as advice as it was implied.</p><p>“Moving on. 
Your second task involves locating a specific target within the city. After you have 
absorbed the energy from your area, search for my signature within yourselves and ‘paint’ it 
with a strand of your own aura onto your weapon. For those of you, who primarily use 
spiritual energy as your weapon of choice paint it onto your arm. That is when your target 
will be revealed to you. This is especially important. Whatever your target may be… you are 
to search it out and strike it with your weapon. The mark painted onto your weapon will 
appear on your target once you have struck it. That... is how we will know if you have 
successfully completed the second task.”</p><p>“What if we don’t finish?” Rei dared to 
ask.</p><p>“You will not be able to leave the city until you have.”</p><p>“I 
see.”</p><p>“That is all. You may begin whenever you feel ready.”</p><p>“Right now...?” 
Usagi squeaked. Personally, she found the floating lights intimidating. It also appeared 
that no one else was eager to make the first move.</p><p><b>Tup. Tup. 
Tup.</b></p><p>“H-Hotaru...?”</p><p>The dark-haired heir stepped forward and stopped just 
before the doorway where the light reached. Her heart was pounding in her chest; although 
she was determined to do this, there were many uncertainties that threatened to hold her 
back. The young woman wasn’t the only one who was concerned for her well-being. She could 
feel the gazes of her friends on her back as well: Wouldn’t this be the first time Hotaru 
would set foot into the city since her reappearance?</p><p>It was then that she heard 
Setsuna say, “Do not do things half-heartedly.”</p><p>Hotaru gulped, and forced herself to 
take that first step. The moment her body touched the light, there was a flash of warmth 
that shot through her. It was as if she had crossed an invisible boundary into an 
alternative dimension.</p><p>Breathing a little heavily, her mind slowly came to grip that 
she was still in one piece.</p><p><i>I...I have to do this. </i>She told herself. <i>For 
everyone’s sake!</i></p><p>“Hotaru!”</p><p>Hotaru had broken out into a full-out sprint 
towards Setsuna’s nearest signature.</p><p><i>So, if we complete this training 
session...will I be strong enough to take him on?</i> Haruka glanced back towards Artemis. 
Her previous defeat, and the humiliation the accompanied it, still burned fiercely in her 
memory.</p><p><i>Heh. Well, what do I have to lose?!</i></p><p>Uranus entered the 
city.</p><p>The others followed shortly after, each departing in pairs until Minako and Rei 
were left. Minako was awkwardly trying to avoid eye contract, but Rei was looking straight 
at her.</p><p>“Minako.” She saw the Venusian automatically glace over at the call of her 
name, but she still refused to meet her eye. “After this is all over, let’s have that talk 
that you wanted, okay?”</p><p>Minako’s head shot up just as Rei ran into the city. For a few 
seconds, she stood there with a stunned expression on her face. Did she really hear what she 
thought she heard? When she realized that she was the only one left, she also ran into the 
city and disappeared into the streets.</p><p>“Is it...really okay to let them go?” Artemis 
asked once they had all left.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Luna honestly replied. “But, this is the 
best chance that we can give them. I can only hope that they all return safe and 
sound.”</p><p>They were both surprised when Setsuna stepped in front of the entranceway and 
began to concentrate her remaining energy into the palm of her hands. Within a blink of an 
eye, the sphere shot outwards and enclosed the entire city within a massive dome shaped 
barrier.</p><p><b>Krreeee, kreeee, krreee…</b></p><p>“Woah!”</p><p>When the spell was 
complete, the woman slumped to her knees.</p><p>“Setsuna!” Artemis and Luna ran to her side 
and attempted to steady her by the shoulders.</p><p>“W-What do you think you’re doing?” 
Artemis asked. “If you had wanted to put up a barrier, I could have done it!”</p><p>The 
former advisor gently shook her head.</p><p>“No… it was required that I do it. This will 
make it mandatory that they complete the second task if they should want to 
leave.”</p><p>“But why is the second task so important?” Luna inquired. “From the sounds of 
it, you’re putting more emphasis on the second task than the first.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“What 
have you done?”</p>
