&quot;DIE!&quot;

&quot;I really wonder about those two sometimes.&quot;  Haruka muttered, earning 
an elbow to the ribs courtesy of her lover.

Today was the day that we were leaving on our little vacation, and it&#39;s 
already off to a bad start. Yesterday, I had gone out and rented a van 
to drive the Inners to our destination, while Haruka planned to drive 
herself, Michiru, Chibi-usa, and our daughter in her own car. Hotaru 
was obviously excited about our trip, and had hardly slept a wink last 
night. She was the first one up this morning and all packed and ready 
to go before the sun had risen.

After we had breakfast, Ami arrived; cloths, books, and laptop in tow. 
After I gave her mother our contact information, she bid Ami farewell 
and headed off to the hospital. Rei showed up next, her grandfather 
dropping her off. While Michiru and Rei were exchanging pleasantries, 
Haruka pulled Ami off to the side and spoke to her quietly; resulting 
in our current situation.

Minako and Makoto arrived together, dropped off Minakos&#39; mother. 
Michiru got a chuckle out of watching Haruka fend off the older woman&#39;s 
somewhat aggressive advances. Usagi was the last to arrive, much to 
Reis&#39; irritation. And much to my daughters delight, Chibi-usa was with 
her. After the two younger girls exchanged a friendly hug, Haruka 
ushered everyone into the house.

Once we were all inside, Haruka began to lay down some ground rules to 
the other girls. No boys in the rooms, no underage drinking, and so on 
and so forth; just like a responsible chaperone. And, like the teenage 
girls they were, her lecture went in one ear and out the other; except 
for Ami, who was as attentive as ever. Then she said there was a 
surprise for all of us, and prompted Ami to show us the results of her 
being able to link her laptop to the Mercury Computer. And, because of 
Harukas&#39; influence, the first picture she showed everyone was the one 
of the Princess and Myung she had shown us last week.

&quot;It&#39;s all your fault, Odango Atama!&quot;

Which is why we were currently outside, watching as Rei was clinging to 
Usagis&#39; back; her legs wrapped around the blondes waist; trying to 
throttle her.

&quot;WAH!! I&#39;m sorry, Rei! ImsorryImsorryImsorryImsorryImsorry!!!&quot; Usagi 
cried as she ran around in circles.

&quot;...shouldn&#39;t we try to break them up?&quot; Michiru asked slowly.

&quot;Ancient Chin Promo: When Rabbit of Moon and Spirit of Fire fight, only 
fool steps between.&quot; Minako solemnly intoned.

Only the sounds of Rei trying to strangle Usagi were heard for a moment 
before Ami said, &quot;Mina-chan? I think you mean &#39;Ancient Chinese 
Proverb&#39;.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I said.&quot; The blonde replied.

I look around at the rest of us as we wait for Rei to finish venting 
her anger. Michiru was looking slightly worried as her love watched 
with interest. Ami stood nearby waiting patiently as Minako and Minako 
both wore expressions of board resignation. On the lawn, Chibi-usa and 
Hotaru sat close to each other and whispered secretively.

Haruka turned to the other blonde of our group and thrust a thumb at 
the two fighting girls. &quot;Are you absolutely sure there&#39;s nothing going 
on between them?&quot; she asked, earning yet another elbow to the ribs from 
Michiru.

Minako watched as Rei forced Usagi to the ground and began shaking her 
repeatedly. &quot;Nope. But sometimes I wonder.&quot;

&#39;It&#39;s best that they don&#39;t know the truth.&#39; I think to myself.

---Silver Millennium---

&quot;Good morning, child.&quot; I greet young Pai warmly as I enter her sitting 
room.

&quot;...hello, Sensei.&quot; She says; her voice far away.

&quot;Pai? Is something wrong?&quot; I ask worriedly as I briskly walk over to 
the chair she&#39;s sitting in.

In the thirteen years I&#39;ve been spending time with young Pai, I&#39;ve seen 
her many moods. Happy, sad, excited, depressed, and anxious; but I&#39;ve 
never seen her so withdrawn and consumed with doubt before.

&quot;...nothing, Sensei.&quot;

I kneel down in front of her chair and reach up and caress her cheek 
gently. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, child? Please, tell me.&quot;

She blushes brightly and refuses to meet my eyes. &quot;As...as I was 
leaving the Library last night, I...I heard a noise coming from Myungs&#39; 
room. I...I was worried and I knocked, but there wasn&#39;t any answer so I 
tried the door and it was unlocked so I went in and I...I...I...&quot;

&quot;Hush. It&#39;s ok, child. It&#39;s alright.&quot; I said softly, pulling her into a 
hug and I begin to stroke her hair reassuringly.

After a while, young Pai calmed down and pulled back slightly, her arms 
still around me. &quot;What happened next, child?&quot;

&quot;I...I walked in and I saw Myung...and the princess...together. 
They...they were kissing and Myung was sliding a hand up the 
princesses&#39; leg and...and the princess was unhooking the back of 
Myungs&#39; dress...&quot;

I slowly roll back to rest on my heels, my hands resting on young Pais&#39; 
lap. After a moment, I stand and walk over to the bay window and sit 
down. I look out the window deep in thought as I feel young Pais&#39; eyes 
on my back. Finally I break the silence.

&quot;Like mother, like daughter; I guess.&quot;

&quot;Sensei?&quot; young Pai asked, obviously shocked by my statement.

&quot;Have you told anyone else?&quot; I ask suddenly.

&quot;No...no I haven&#39;t. I wanted to talk to you first.&quot;

&quot;Good, good.&quot; I say, then fall silent for a moment. &quot;What do you think 
about the princess and Myung? What are your feelings towards them?&quot;

&quot;I...like them, I guess.&quot; She answered slowly, long used to me suddenly 
changing topics during our talks. &quot;The princess...she&#39;s sometimes acts 
childish for her age, but she&#39;s so kind and gentle. Myung, well she 
acts so tough and independent and she comes across as abrasive 
sometimes but she&#39;s very nice and caring.&quot;

&quot;And do you feel anything for them?&quot;

&quot;Sensei?&quot;

&quot;Do you hold any romantic feeling towards them?&quot;

I hear her gasp sharply. &quot;...no, Sensei...&quot;

&quot;I see. That makes this easier.&quot; I say, taking a moment to compose 
myself as I gaze out the window. &quot;What I&#39;m about to tell you, you are 
not to repeat to anyone. Understand?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Sensei.&quot;

&quot;I was born into the House of Nova, a minor House that governs Umbriel. 
Being from such an unpopulated moon, I basically spent the first few 
years of my life alone. When I was seven, I was Awakened as the next 
Senshi of Time; and suddenly I was thrust into the spotlight. My 
predecessor, Lady Aika, came to Umbriel herself to bring me to the 
Lunar Palace. She was a formidable person and, quite frankly, she 
scared me badly during our trip to the Moon. Arriving here at the 
Palace, I was frightened and alone and it seemed like everyone kept 
treating me like I was an oddity; a freak. Everyone, that is, except 
one. She was a year younger than I was and she came up to me and said 
that she wanted to be my friend. I remember hesitantly nodding before 
she hugged me tightly.&quot;

I fall silent, wrapped in my memories. Several moments pass before I 
hear young Pai ask, &quot;The Queen?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Princess Serenity the thirty-fourth; heir to the Moon Kingdom. 
You have no idea how...special she made me feel. From that day forth we 
were inseparable, we did everything together. The two of us got in and 
out of trouble more times than Myung and the princess do...of course we 
got caught few times then they do.&quot; I chuckle, then sigh with regret. 
&quot;But time passed and we grew older. I spent more and more time at the 
Gates of Time with Lady Aika and the rest of her Senshi began to 
Awaken; the first being the Senshi of Jupiter.&quot;

&quot;Lady Nanami?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Nanami.&quot; I say her name harshly. &quot;She was about the same age as 
Serenity was when she came to the Palace. I was so jealous of her 
because she was able to spend more time with Serenity that I was. But I 
never let her know how I felt, knowing it would break her heart that I 
didn&#39;t like her new friend. Time passed and the days I spent with Lady 
Aika turned into weeks, then months; and the rest of her Senshi 
awakened. But every time I would visit, I would see Serenity and Nanami 
growing closer and closer, while it felt like the two of us were 
drifting further apart.  Finally, one day Lady Aika announced that she 
was going to pass the mantle of Pluto on to me.

&quot;I was so excited. I couldn&#39;t believe it. There I was, only 17 years 
old and I was about to be formally recognized as one of the Senshi; the 
Senshi of Pluto, no less. I used my powers to reach out to Serenity and 
teleported to her, not being able to wait to tell her the news.&quot;

Sighing deeply, I press on. &quot;When I appeared here in the Palace, I 
found Serenity and Nanami together in a far more compromising situation 
that you just described. Sigh. I don&#39;t know how long I stood there, 
watching them. At first, I was confused, not understanding how she 
could betray me like that. Then I felt anger, not at Serenity; I could 
never hate her; but towards Nanami. I believed that she had somehow 
&#39;corrupted&#39; my friend; that she turned her away from me.&quot;

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Ami asked softly.

&quot;What could I do? I left. I went to my quarters and tried to make sense 
of what I had seen; but all that happened that night was that my anger 
for Nanami grew more and more intense. That morning, I left my quarters 
and searched for the one who I was convinced had &#39;corrupted&#39; my pure 
and innocent friend.&quot;

My voice trails off as I stair out at nothing. The seconds pass in 
silence before I start to speak again. &quot;When I found her, I confronted 
her with what I had seen the night before. She told me that it was none 
of my business what she and Serenity did together.&quot; I sighed deeply 
before I continued. &quot;Truthfully, I don&#39;t remember a third of what we 
said to each other. All I know is that we were this close to trying to 
tear the other&#39;s throat out. There we were, two of the most powerful 
woman in the Moon Kingdom; Senshi in all but name; ready to strike at 
each other. If Nae hadn&#39;t come by when she did, I shudder to think what 
we would have done. At the least, we would have easily leveled the 
South Wing; the worst, we could have killed each other or...or Serenity 
could&#39;ve been hurt.&quot;

I sigh, &quot;So, I left. I retreated to the Gates of Time and stayed there, 
only to return when I was summoned by the Queen. Every time I was 
forced to come back, I avoided Serenity; even though it broke my heart 
to see the confused hurt on her face whenever she looked in my 
direction. Time passed, and Serenity became the ruler of the Moon 
Kingdom...and she was betrothed. I found out later from Nae that the 
day that Serenitys&#39; engagement was announced, Nanami left the Palace 
without a word and isolated herself at Io Castle and, like myself, only 
left there to perform her Duties.

&quot;To this day, no one else knew about Serenitys&#39; and Nanamis&#39; 
relationship but me, and Serenity never knew why Nanami and I had 
fought that day. I think Nae might suspect something, but she never 
said anything to me. Since then, my friendship with Serenity has been 
strained; In fact, I think the main reason she asked me to tutor you 
was so she could see me again. No offence.&quot;

After a moment, young Pai asked, &quot;Were...were you and the Queen 
ever...&quot;

&quot;Intimate? No.&quot; I answer as I turn in my seat to look at her. &quot;I&#39;ll 
admit that when I was younger I had...fantasies about her, but I never 
acted on them. I realized that while I love her, I wasn&#39;t IN love with 
her. Do you understand?&quot;

I was somewhat surprised when young Pai locked eyes with me for a 
moment, her cerulean orbs glowing with an inner light. As quickly as it 
happened, she broke eye contact and looked at the floor. &quot;Yes Sensei. I 
understand.&quot; She said in a hushed tone.

I watch her for a moment, wondering what just happened, when young Pai 
spoke hesitantly. &quot;So...what do we do about what I saw?&quot;

&quot;Nothing. Were I to say something, people would only see what I tell 
them as coming from the Senshi of Pluto; and not as Iria; and they 
would take drastic measures to separate Myung from the princess.&quot;

That caused young Pai to look up at me curiously. &quot;Why would they do 
that, Sensei?&quot;

&quot;Because, child, when all is said and done, all the people really care 
about is that there is a Serenity on the Throne. The line of Serenity 
extends back for more than 1600 years and the nobles would see any 
physical relationship that the princess would have with another woman 
as a threat to the line of succession.&quot; I answer her then, with a sly 
smile, I try to lighten the somber mood. &quot;Your seventeen years old now, 
child. I know it&#39;s something we&#39;ve never talked about before, but if 
you feel the need to cover the subject we could talk about sex-ed.&quot;

I watch as young Pais&#39; face turns crimson and she tries to retreat into 
the cushions of her chair. &quot;Sensei...&quot; she says, her voice thick with 
embarrassment.

&quot;As for what you should do,&quot; I say seriously. &quot;Act like there&#39;s nothing 
going on. Hopefully, they&#39;re just experimenting. If this is something 
more serious, be there for them because the road they&#39;re traveling is 
one destined for heartbreak one day.&quot;

&quot;I think I understand, Sensei.&quot;

&quot;Good. Is there anything else you want to tell me?&quot;

Young Pai looked up at me, with that strange look in her eyes again, 
and opened her mouth slightly. She then seemed to deflate somewhat as 
that odd inner light faded again. &quot;Actually Sensei, there is. Lady Airi 
is stepping down next week and I&#39;ll officially Ascend to the Senshi of 
Mercury. Will...will you be able to come to the ceremony?&quot;

&quot;Congratulations!&quot; I say as I stand from my seat and walk over to her 
chair. I grasp her hands and pull her to her feet and hugged her. &quot;Of 
course I&#39;ll be there!&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Sensei.&quot; Young Pai said as she tenderly returned my 
embrace.

&quot;And don&#39;t you worry; I&#39;ll still visit you as often as I can. You have 
no idea how much I enjoy spending time with you.&quot;

&quot;Neither do you, Sensei.&quot; Young Pai whispered softly, &quot;Neither do you.&quot;

---Silver Millennium---

&quot;Come on! Come on! Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go! Where burning daylight 
here, you know!&quot;

I shake my head slightly to clear the memories of the past as Rei 
begins herding everyone towards the cars. Looking around, I see Haruka, 
Michiru, Hotaru, and Chibi-usa already getting into the car. Meanwhile, 
Rei is pushing Usagi forward towards the van and I notice Makoto giving 
Ami a curious glance. The taller girl moved closer to Ami and was about 
to say something when, suddenly, Minako was there.

She gave me a curious smile before turning to Makoto. &quot;Come on, 
Mako-chan! Let&#39;s get the back seat before anyone else does!&quot; she said, 
grabbing the brunette&#39;s hand and pulling her towards the van.

&quot;But I...&quot; Makoto stammered, only to fall prey to the blondes&#39; 
determination.

As I make my way to the driver&#39;s side, I reflect on the past. 
Fortunately, while the relationship that Myung and the princess had was 
somewhat serious, it at least ended amicably. From what Pai had told me 
later, they had realized that their relationship wasn&#39;t meant to be; 
especially after Prince Endymion had come onto the scene.

Sitting the drivers&#39; seat, I start the engine and turn to the person in 
the passengers&#39; seat and ask, &quot;Shall we go?&quot;

&quot;Yes, lets.&quot; Ami said with a shy smile.

To Be Continued...

Author&#39;s Notes...

(Slowly, we see Chibi-usa walking across the screen caring a bass drum 
that she is beating rhythmically.)

&quot;He keeps going and going and going and going and going and going...&quot;

He, he, he. One myth put to rest (at least in THIS fic). Now...what to 
do, what to do...

Hum...is it me, or is that every time I&#39;m trying to write one of these 
notes, the radio is playing &#39;Serenity&#39; by Godsmack?

As Always any C&amp;C would be appreciated.
