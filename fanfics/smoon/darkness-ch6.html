4 years has passed since that day when Serena lost her temper. Nobody 
talked about because they didn&#39;t want to remember it. Serena and Rei 
have gotten close over the years. Where ever one went the other was 
right beside them&#39;. It was a rather cute site.

Amara always teased them about them being girlfriends, but they 
ignored it every time. Serena, Rei and Hotaru had trained hard and 
today they were going to do their first hunt. Serena began looking up 
to Amara and Michelle as her parents and they accepted her as a 
daughter like Rei and Hotaru.

The three little vampires ran excitedly down the hallway towards Amara 
and Michelle&#39;s room. They banged on the door loudly until Michelle 
popped out from behind the door.

&quot;Come on Michelle-mama!! Let&#39;s go.&quot;, exclaimed Serena excitedly. The 
three girls eyes were red with hunger with fangs peeking out from 
behind their lips. They were becoming very impatient. Amara decided 
not to feed them today so they could prepare themselves for the hunt.

Michelle laughed at their eagerness as Rei and Hotaru grabbed each of 
her hands and pulled her out of the room.

&quot;Where&#39;s Amara-papa?&quot;, questioned Rei looking around for the woman.

&quot;She&#39;s outside&quot;, said Michelle as she was escorted down the hall. 
Serena stayed closely next to Rei as they walked outside the front 
door.

As soon as they were outside they immediately spotted Amara leaning 
against a wall smoking a cigarette. Amara turned around and saw her 4 
favorite ladies and smiled. She walked up to them tossed her cigarette 
and slung an arm around Michelle&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;You three look hungry.&quot;, said Amara with a slight grin. She was just 
as excited as the girls. This was their big day and they have been 
waiting for 4 years.

&quot;Where starving.&quot;, replied Hotaru as she jumped into Amara&#39;s arms. 
Amara laughed and walked towards a Black Convertible. Amara and 
Michelle sat in the front with the three girls in the back.

Hotaru and Serena sat by the car doors while Rei sat in the middle. 
Amara drove to an empty parking lot. The five females jumped out of 
the car and walked towards the city where was plenty of people running 
around. And one of three of them would be chosen for the girls prey.

&quot;Alright&quot;, said Amara. &quot;I&#39;m going to pick the people who your going to 
hunt. You three will be left on your own. When your done with your 
hunt or run into a slayer, report back to here, well be waiting for 
you.&quot;

The three nodded their heads and walked down the street like they 
didn&#39;t have a care in the world.

Rei wore a blood red t-shirt with a black bubble vest over it. She had 
on baggy black jeans with tan colored timberlin boots and a red 
bandana. Rei had put in red streaks in her hair black hair for more 
better look. Hotaru wore a dark purple tank top which showed her well 
toned muscles in her abs. She also wore black leather pants with 
leather boots that buckled up to her knees. She had on a black 
backwards hat. She also streaked her hair black hair except it was 
purple instead of red.

Serena wore a silver tank top much like Hotaru&#39;s except Serena&#39;s had a 
dragon outlined in black on it. She wore baggy dark blue jeans with 
silver Lugz boots. Serena had put in some blonde streaks in her silver 
hair in which Rei insisted on. Serena wore a silver beanie cap to 
complete her set clothing.

Amara quickly picked out three people who will be hunted for her 
&#39;children&#39;. The three vampires went their separate ways as Amara and 
Michelle watch them go off.

&quot;Do you think that their really ready?&quot;, asked Michelle in a voice 
that said &#39;My babies are growing to fast&#39;. Amara put an arm around her 
woman to reassure her.

&quot;Of course. We taught them well and they will do fine.&quot;, said Amara 
with much confidents for her girls. &quot; Come on let&#39;s do a quick hunt 
ourselves. I&#39;m a little hungry.&quot;

After that remark Amara&#39;s eyes glowed green and had her fangs appear. 
Michelle smirked and had her eye&#39;s flash green as well. The two women 
ran off into the night to catch a little snack.</pre>
