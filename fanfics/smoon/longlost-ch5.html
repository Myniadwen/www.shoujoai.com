A.N. Ok people I Really Need help here so if any other authors would 
like to Help I would Really like that. And you guys should know the 
drill by now I do not own anything save for Crystal Rose Winter A.K.A 
Sailor Ice. And I hope you like the story so please R&amp;R to let me 
know. Oh and one last thing I like all of the Scouts so they will not 
turn bad and as you can tell I do not like Darien so he will be BAD&#133; 
Read &amp; Review. Ok on with story J 


Last Time

The fourth unknown voice looked down towards the Scouts. &#147;Uh oh I 
think we are in trouble guys.&#148;


Now


&#147;It&#146;s Jadeite, Nephrite, Zoicite, and Malachite,&#148; Yelled four 
disbelieving voices of Amy, Raye, Lita, and Mina. As they looked up to 
see four faces that they have not seen in five years. Four men whom, 
were thought to be dead jumped down from their hiding place and to the 
surprise of the Scout did not attack but instead kneeled before them 
and it was Malachite that broke the silence. &#147;We come to you not as 
enemies but as friend. You may not remember this but in the Silver 
Alliance we where on the good side in fact we were your lovers. But 
when Endymion found out about the Princess and Sailor Uranus. And was 
banished away from the Silver Alliance he forced us to go to Beryl we 
tried to come to you. But Endymion had already sold his soul and had 
us kidnapped. When we were brainwashed we had no choice but to do as 
we were told&#133; we did not want to attack you even when we were 
brainwashed we knew what was going on. But we had no control over our 
bodies.&#148; Malachite ended hoping that they would believe them and 
forgive them as well. Mina being the one in charge when Serena was not 
there looked at Amy and Raye, and said. &#147;You two check them of any 
dark energy. And, Lita if they do we are going to take down some 
Nega-trash. And in the meantime I am going to call Serena and the 
Outers just in case we need back up.&#148;  &#147;Serena Michelle Amara Hotaru 
and Trista please come in we may need you here at the temple.&#147; &#147;We 
shall be right there Mina Michelle out.&#147; &#147;Same here just as soon as I 
take care of something Amara out&#148; &#147;I am on my way Mina Hotaru out.&#148; 
&#147;Even though I have a feeling you will not need me I too will be there 
Trista out&#148; I am also on my way Mina Serena out.&#147; As Mina was 
finishing up, Amy and Raye both spoke up with what the Mercury 
computer had on the four men in font of them. &#147;From what my computer 
is saying they have not a trace of dark energy in them.&#148;  &#147;And I can&#146;t 
scene any dark energy from them either.&#148; 


Meanwhile

Darien was in a headlock with Amara and Crystal was just about to 
finish with erasing his memories when all of a sudden he vanished out 
of Amara&#146;s hold but you could hear his voice. &#147;You have not seen the 
last of me I will get what I want and NO ONE WILL STOP ME 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!&#148; &#147;Come on Kris you might be able to help out now 
that I know that it is you that is Sailor Ice I know that Serena is in 
good hands when I am not near&#133;how am I going to tell her that I love 
though? You would not have any ideas would Kris?&#148; said Amara as she 
and Crystal started to the temple on the way the caught up with 
Michelle and Serena just as they caught up with Trista and Hotaru just 
before going up the stairs to the temple. When they got up they opened 
the door just as Jadeite Nephlite Zoicite and Malachite were turning 
around. When Serena saw who was in the room with the Scouts she 
blacked out. Just as she was about to hit the ground a blinding silver 
light came from her locket and she vanished. The Scout thinking that 
someone had kidnapped her started to transformed when all in the room 
heard a soothing voice say. &#147;All is well Sailors you will have your 
Princess back soon I just need to talk to her so please my friends do 
not worry.&#148; soon the Scout realized who the voice belonged to and it 
was none other than Queen Serenity.
