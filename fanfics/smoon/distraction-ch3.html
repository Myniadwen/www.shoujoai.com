<p>Rei was seated quietly inside the penthouse. She just heard Minako  get off the phone with Usagi and winced when she heard a very distinct  squeal from the other line. The idol then walked back into the living  room with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“They’re on their way now.”</p>
<p>“Hm. So what have you been up to these days?”</p>
<p>“Other than touring? Well, I have been thinking about taking a break.”</p>
<p>“So, you’ll be staying here for a while?” There was a slight bit of curiosity in the miko’s voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll be around more often. I can’t seem to stay away from home so long. I always find myself being drawn back.”</p>
<p>Rei  felt something build up inside of her. She wasn’t quite sure if it was  a sense of feeling excited, or the fact that she was also nervous.  Having Minako back in her life brought back so many memories that she  tried so hard to erase, but at the same time the miko couldn’t help but  think that maybe this was a good opportunity for her.</p>
<p>“Minako I…”  before Rei could even finish her sentence there was a knock on the  door. She could hear the muffled voices of Makoto, Ami, and especially  Usagi. Minako stood up and answered the door, only to be tackled by  Usagi.</p>
<p>“Oh I am so glad we are all together again! Rei-chan!”  exclaimed Usagi as she ran to her friend and gave her a big hug. The  miko did not brace herself from the impact and ended up feeling  suffocated from nearly being hugged to death.</p>
<p>“Great…to….see…you…too…Usagi,”  she said between gasps of breaths. Usagi finally let go of Rei and  jumped around the room in excitement. Everyone stared at her, knowing  fully well that she would eventually settle down.</p>
<p>“I’m so hurt that you didn’t even tell us about you returning here!” exclaimed the odango-haired girl.</p>
<p>“Gomen. I wanted to settle down and get my things in order before calling.”</p>
<p>“So how long will you two be staying in Tokyo?” asked Makoto.</p>
<p>“Oh… I’m thinking about hanging around for a while here. Taking a break from the tour,” replied Minako.</p>
<p>“Really?! Plan on doing any concerts in the near future?!” exclaimed Usagi.</p>
<p>Minako laughed at Usagi’s excitement, and nodded.</p>
<p>“Hai,  maybe a few events here and there, nothing too big. I really just want  to relax while here. You know, actually get to hang out with you guys  and live a normal life for a change.”</p>
<p>“You know that’s impossible Minako. With your popularity soaring, you’re bound to be trampled by fans, if not by Usagi.”</p>
<p>“How about you Rei?” asked Ami.</p>
<p>The  miko slowly looked up at them, and didn’t know how to answer. In fact,  she was completely unsure of her plans at the moment. Her sensei simply  commanded for her return, but never specified the length of time she  was to stay.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, really,” she answered. <em>I’m not even sure why I here, </em>she  thought quietly. The room began to feel awkward when she realized that  everyone was looking at her. They held unsure looks on their faces that  were easily dismissed.</p>
<p>“Well, these two just got back. We really should start worrying about when they’re going to leave,” said Makoto finally.</p>
<p>“Anyway, are we going to do anything tonight?” asked Ami.</p>
<p>“I really just wanted to see everyone again, that it completely slipped my mind on the plans after meeting up!” replied Minako.</p>
<p>“There’s  this new place in town that we could all go to. Motoki and I were  scouting areas for a new shop, and we discovered this cute little  restaurant nearby.”</p>
<p>They all nodded in agreement and slowly made  their way downstairs. Since Makoto was borrowing Motoki’s car, there  was barely enough room for the girls to squeeze in. Usagi had already  called shots for the front seat, and Ami insisted on sitting nearby the  window. Rei was sitting uncomfortably next to Minako, that the idol's  familiar scent drifted into her nostrils. She couldn’t help but sneak  in small glances while the idol was looking out the window.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan.  So how are things in Kyoto?” asked Makoto when she noticed Rei’s  behavior from the rear view mirror. The miko snapped back into reality,  obviously surprised, and stuttered a bit until she finally got her  words right.</p>
<p>“Oh. Well...it’s very serene. Nothing like how it is  here. You guys should come and visit sometime.” Rei secretly cursed  herself for saying that, knowing fully well that such a suggestion  would be carried out.</p>
<p>“Aw. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if Mamoru and  I could make a getaway to some place so romantic?” Usagi was now  spacing out, and Makoto threw a handkerchief at her face. The odango  haired girl literally hissed at her, which caught everyone off guard  and made Rei laugh a little.</p>
<p>“What was that for?” she asked.</p>
<p>“You  were starting to drool,” answered Makoto as she kept her eyes on the  road for there was less streetlight now. The restaurant was becoming a  bit difficult to locate.</p>
<p>“I swear it was around here somewhere.  Oh. There it is!” exclaimed Makoto as she took an unexpected turn.  Everyone was caught in surprised from the sudden jerk of the car. Ami  grabbed hold of something to keep her from sliding towards Rei.  However, the miko being seated in the middle had nothing to hold on to,  and her body flew over towards Minako. The idol turned to Rei and was  suddenly pinned against the window with their faces inches away. Minako  closed her eyes, and from Ami’s point of view the very sight looked  like the two girls were making out.</p>
<p>“Gomen, I didn’t realize that  I was going that fast,” said Makoto, finally gaining control of the car  and checked to see if everyone was not hurt. She saw the sight of Rei  still pinning the idol against the window and her eyes widened. Minako  slowly opened her eyes only to find herself staring at a pair of  familiar fierce ones. She could feel Rei’s longhair tickle her ears,  and was unable to move having the miko’s body pinned against hers.  Feeling herself begin to blush, the idol tried to look away.</p>
<p>“Rei…I  think it’s okay to sit down now,” she finally said. The miko snapped  out of her daze and was frozen in her position. She knew that she was  able to sit back into her seat. She was very aware that perhaps her  friends were looking at them awkwardly, but she couldn’t find herself  moving away. The miko could feel the warmth of Minako’s breath against  her skin, and it made her palms sweat and heart beat faster. <em>Why…why do I feel like this? </em></p>
<p>Finally  getting back into her senses, the miko quickly jerked away from Minako,  slightly flushed from what just happened. Embarrassment began to grab a  hold of her, and Rei slowly started to slouch down in her seat. Only to  feel a pang of surprise, when her leg accidentally brushed Minako’s.  She was now inwardly cursing herself, <em>Baka! Nearly two years of training, and I can’t even get full control of these emotions!</em></p>
<p>Usagi  was too busy trying to calm herself down from the suddenly turn that  she was the only one who had not taken notice of what had just happened  between Minako and Rei. The two were now facing opposite directions and  Rei caught a glimpse of Makoto on the rear view mirror. She had an evil  smirk plastered on her face, and the miko cursed at herself even more.</p>
