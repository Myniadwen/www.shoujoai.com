<h1>Letting Go</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	The cool night air touches my skin and I shiver under its soft
assault. Clasping my hands on the thick marble of the balcony I study
the night sky.
	The sky is black. Black reminds me of death. Death reminds
me of myself.
	A slight wind kicks up and I hug myself for warmth as I watch
the steady lap of the waves hitting the beach. Since I was little I&#39;ve
loved the ocean.
	It reminds me of the comforts and safety of childhood. When
things were much more simple.
	As a child I knew what I wanted and I asked for it. It may
have taken me awhile to work up the courage to ask but nevertheless
I asked. And when I did I was usually rewarded by receiving
whatever I had asked for.
	I&#39;m now an adult and have since realized that simply asking for
something doesn&#39;t always insure that you&#39;ll get it.
	Over the years I&#39;ve always longed for one thing and one thing
only but I&#39;ve yet to ask for it.
	I doubt very much that I&#39;ll ever be able to work up the
courage to ask for it. As painful as it is sometimes you have to realize
that some things will remain unattainable.
	And for me she will always remain unattainable.
	&quot;Aren&#39;t you cold out here?&quot;
	My eyes close at the irony of the situation. I simply think of
her and she appears. The Kami must enjoy to torture me because I
can find no other explanation for the horrible string of luck in my life.
	I look to her and give a small smile.
	&quot;I don&#39;t mind the cold. I was looking at the stars. They&#39;re
pretty, aren&#39;t they?&quot;
	She walks closer and stops next to me. Her gentle hands rest
on the balcony as she tilts her head back to stare into the night sky
that once preoccupied me so.
	&quot;They&#39;re very pretty.&quot;
	Her gaze locks with my own and she adds softly.
	&quot;Just like you.&quot;
	I duck my eyes and I can feel my cheeks flush from her
words. Why must she always tease me so? I know that nothing can
come from it. She&#39;s much too good for me and I know it. Her strength
is amazing and it is because I&#39;ve seen that strength with my own eyes
that I know she would never want an emotional weakling like me.
	&quot;Thank you.&quot;
	&quot;For what? All I did was tell the truth.&quot;
	There&#39;s a hint of rage in her voice and I meet her eyes upon
hearing it. She studies me closely and I shrink under her gaze. It has
always bothered me... the attention of others.
	She suddenly sets her jaw and questions.
	&quot;You don&#39;t believe me do you? You think I was just being
nice when I said that you were pretty.&quot;
	I blink at the anger in her words and I can only stare at her
helplessly as she continues on.
	&quot;I wouldn&#39;t lie about something like that! Why would I? What
purpose would it serve?&quot;
	In a movement of obvious frustration she shakes her head and
runs her fingers through tousled bangs. She gives a ragged sigh and
looks to me.
	&quot;You&#39;re the only one who can do this to me, you do know
that right? I&#39;ve had to learn perfect diplomacy over the years but as
soon as I talk to you...&quot; She rolls her eyes and says wryly, &quot;It seems
to fly right out the window.&quot;
	There is a long moment of silence and I study her through
lidded eyes before I offer my defense.
	&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
	Her gaze drops to the railing of the balcony and she slumps
onto it burying her head in her arms. She sighs once again and says in
muffled tones.
	&quot;Sorry for what? You didn&#39;t do anything. You never do
anything. It&#39;s always me.&quot;
	My body goes numb when I hear this. I never do anything?
She doesn&#39;t know just how right she is. After all, I&#39;ve let countless
years pass without ever doing anything about my feelings for her.
While she keeps trying... for some reason she keeps trying to be
friends with me.
	I lock my gaze onto her. She has lifted her head and her chin
rests on her arms as she stares out into the ocean. I desire her... I
want her... I love her...
	It&#39;s about time that I told her that.
	&quot;It embarrasses me when you give me compliments. It
embarrasses me because of how they make me feel.&quot;
	She looks up at me in quiet disbelief.
	&quot;How... how do they make you feel?&quot;
	&quot;Loved.&quot;
	&quot;Loved?&quot;
	&quot;Yes. I know you don&#39;t love me--&quot;
	&quot;Of course I do! You&#39;re my best friend! I--&quot;
	I shake my head at this and interrupt her with gentle words
laced with steel.
	&quot;No. I meant that you don&#39;t love me as I love you. I know that
you care for me as a friend but I no longer care for you that way.&quot;
	In a smooth graceful movement she pushes herself up to stand
at her full height across from me. She reaches out to take my hand
tenderly into her own.
	&quot;I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying.&quot;
	My eyes remain focused on the cold marble of the balcony
floor. Slowly I lift my gaze to meet hers and swallowing the lump in
my throat I say simply.
	&quot;I&#39;m in love with you. I love you not as a friend but as a lover.
I have for quite some time now and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve pushed you away
these past few years. It hurts too much to be with you and to still...
not be with you.&quot;
	She releases my hands and turns from me. I watch as her
shoulders tense while she grips the railing to the balcony.
	&quot;You&#39;re in love with me?&quot;
	Before I can reply she faces me and her eyes are glowing with
a ferocity I&#39;ve never seen in her.
	&quot;You&#39;ve been in love with me for years now and you never felt
the need to tell me before now? Didn&#39;t you think that this is something
I&#39;d like to know about?&quot;
	I blink at this. I never expected her to be indignant or angry at
me. Disgust or pity were the emotions that I had been expecting to
see from her. I meet her eyes then offer my oldest and most used
defense.
	&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re sorry? Is that all you can say?!&quot;
	She gives a sudden cry of frustration and looking up to the
heavens she mutters to herself. When she lowers her eyes to meet
mine she sighs and says.
	&quot;Idiot. I&#39;m in love with you too.&quot;
	My eyes go wide at this and I whisper.
	&quot;Really?&quot;
	At this she laughs lightly and walks to me. She gently cups my
face in her hands and I shiver as I feel her hot breath on my skin. Our
lips are millimeters apart as she replies.
	&quot;Really.&quot;
	We draw together in a searing embrace and when we pull
apart from the need of air I can feel myself smiling. Her head rests on
my chest and I pull her closer. Hoping it isn&#39;t a dream I say her name.
	&quot;Chibiusa.&quot;
	She lifts her head and warm scarlet eyes smile at me. The tips
of her fingers lightly caress my face and she says my name softly like it
was a prayer.
	&quot;Hotaru.&quot;
	Our smiles deepen and as we move in for another passionate
embrace I can feel myself let go of my fears from the past because
now I have everything I&#39;ve ever wanted.
	And everything I could&#39;ve ever asked for.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I came up with this fanfic because some friends asked me to try a hand at 
this couple. I normally don&#39;t think of Chibiusa and Hotaru in romantic
terms but since reading the fanfics by the Amazoness Duo I&#39;ve
changed my mind. Please don&#39;t write to me saying that these
characters are much too young for this sort of thing. I realize that and I
did age them appropriately in this story so nothing scandalous would
be going on. Now I&#39;m off to listen to the Key: The Metal Idol
soundtrack.

&quot;Hanging onto the past, it only stands in the way. We have to go for a
love that lasts.&quot;
