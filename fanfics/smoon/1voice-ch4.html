<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On Jupiter, Part Two: Fire-arrow<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  morning brought what seemed like silence. With the lack of the howling  winds and rumbling thunder from the night before, even the calls of the  birds seemed hushed and reverent.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei listened closer. There were  other noises, too. Gentle breathing. And an easy rhythm that matched  the steady beating of her heart…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her eyes shot open and the  events of the night before hit her like a tangible force, but as soon  as she took in her surroundings, she forced herself to relax so as not  disturb her companion. A crooked smirk tugged at her lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  body was draped over her own. Though the bedroll was cast over both of  their bodies, she could feel one of Minako’s long legs laced in between  hers, an arm across her stomach, and the woman’s head was nestled  securely in the crook of her neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After the weakness she’d displayed the night before, it did the Martian a world of good to wake up with the Venusian in <em>her</em> arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  found herself absently running her fingers through Minako’s golden  tresses despite herself. But when she felt the butterfly touch of  eyelashes against her neck, she quickly pulled her hand away, even if  the arm lightly wrapped around the Venusian’s waist didn’t budge.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re awake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako snuggled even closer, tightening her grip around the stiffening Martian. “You didn’t have to stop doing that, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Playing with my hair. You didn’t have to stop.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh… oh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  wide grin claimed Minako’s lips when the Priestess resumed her task,  this time a bit more boldly as she ran her fingernails through the  Venusian’s bangs and across her scalp. Minako did her best to keep her  voice unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you feel better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un.” Rei hesitated, at odds with herself. “Thank you.” She said finally.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  merely nodded, knowing better than to make a fuss out of the events of  the night before so as to not hurt the pride of the willful Martian.  Instead, she allowed herself to bask in Rei’s gentle, if hesitant  ministrations, and just as she nearly submitted to sleep’s gentle call  despite the morning hour, she felt her attention being pulled to a  distinct sensation beneath her wandering fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cerulean eyes  fluttered open to examine several small, raised scars on the Martian’s  forearm. “What happened?” She asked quietly as she examined the old  wounds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Going by the Venusian’s soft, lingering touch that belied  her constant snarky barbs and conflicting behaviors, Rei understood  what was being asked without even looking. “They’re scars left from  rituals used to promote good luck and fortune before going into risky  battle. A Prayer Ritual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A sacrifice?” Minako looked up the Martian’s amethyst eyes. “And it worked?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  snorted. “I’m still alive, aren’t I?” She cracked a distant smile. “I  haven’t had to evoke the ritual in some time, but I should show it to  you eventually. Your peoples may benefit from it. <em>We</em> may benefit from it against the youma, should the battle against them worsen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  nestled her head back onto Rei’s chest. “I’m sure we could use all the  prayers we can get.” She chuckled softly. “I’m not so sure about the  self mutilation thing though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian responded by  tightening her arms around the golden haired woman. “No, I suppose the  Venusians wouldn’t appreciate that, much, even if they are mere  scratches.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The mood shifted slightly. The Venusian swallowed audibly. “Ne, Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Answer a question for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Whether  it was due to the soft fingers that suddenly splayed across her bare  midriff, or fear of a question that might wander outside of her comfort  zone, the Priestess stiffened. “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako propped herself up  on an elbow. Cerulean eyes turned serious. “If someone is siphoning  what you sense, does it weaken you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What was this woman’s need to get to know her better? Rei tore her gaze from Minako’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian followed the Martian’s feint and her fingers were quick to  lightly trace Rei’s jaw line, though the stubborn Priestess offered no  small amount of resistance and still refused to make eye contact with  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But Minako was undeterred. “Then why did you let me do it last night? And the other day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…”  The Priestess hesitated. Her amethyst eyes narrowed. Her fingers  gripped the loose cloth of Minako’s shirt tightly, only to release it  again. “I… I have to pee!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Despite the weight that held her down, the Martian managed to slip from Minako’s embrace and stumble out of the tent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian sighed and stretched out across the spot Rei had vacated. She  chuckled. It was the first ungraceful rebuttal she’d heard from the  woman.</span></p>
‘Have I affected her that much?’
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“The storm broke.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We should probably get up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, sleepyhead. I know you’ve been awake for the past hour. We should break camp.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t wanna.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto  smiled. This was a side of herself the genius only ever showed to her,  but she knew an effective way of rousing the Mercurian. Her lips found  the sensitive skin of Ami’s collarbone and suddenly, the other woman’s  childish protests turned into very adult moans.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re worse than me.” Ami purred.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I highly doubt that. It was you who kept me up last night, despite that snake bite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami  smirked wickedly, another gesture she saved only for the tall Jovian  pinned underneath her petite form. “I didn’t hear you complaining then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you won’t hear me complaining now.” Makoto purred as she lifted her  torso to claim the other woman’s increasingly tempting lips…</span></p>
“I have to pee!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto’s head hit her pillow and Ami sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like they’re back at it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow, I have a feeling it was a pretty interesting night in <em>their</em> tent, too.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Little  was said after the four had broken camp. Quickly and efficiently, the  warriors had packed their belongings and hit the trail once more.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Despite  the weather having broken, the going was still tough. Instead of the  constant rain and wind, the hot, humid weather weighed the travelers  down. Attracted by the ever present mud and the promise of fresh blood,  biting insects were in abundance, even as they’d progressed out of the  tropical band of rainforests and into the flat prairies of tall grass  beyond. The sight of the distant sun was a rare treat on the normally  cloudy planet, and it slowly trekked across the sparsely cloudy sky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hours  later, sunset on the Jovian surface brought sorely needed relief and as  the orange orb of the sun met with the red and orange clouds near the  horizon, dusk on the prairie looked more like a fading firestorm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s getting dark already.” Minako noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was harder to tell yesterday since it was storming, but a day on Jupiter lasts only ten hours.” Ami said matter of factly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks like we’ll be trekking through the night then.” Rei barked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like fun.” The Venusian sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, it should be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ami-chan, are you feeling alright?” Minako asked in a mocking voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto  raised an eyebrow to her leader. “A clear night on Jupiter is full of  surprises, and we’re on the perfect terrain to catch some of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some  of what?” Minako asked, even as she walked right into Rei’s unyielding  form. Following the Priestess’ upward gaze, even the yappy Venusian  shut her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A cylindrical ring of light stretched across the  ever-darkening sky, forming a lazy circle of electric blue and the  brightest white. Nearing the sky’s horizon, one of Jupiter’s satellites  raced its way through the night sky. A pocked orb of yellowish green,  it wasn’t necessarily its large size that was of interest, but more its  plumes of volcanic activity that exploded outwards in wide arcs in the  night sky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aurora borealis,” Ami’s observation was more out of  awe than instruction, yet it was in her nature to explain the  phenomenon, “caused by the magnetic reactions of Io’s volcanoes. It’s a  rare treat to see both at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Minako’s awed comment could do the view no justice, but then, no words could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  the women stood in awe of the phenomenon, Io completed its fast, fiery  descent just as Ganymede began to break over the opposite horizon. At  twice the size of the other satellite, it showered the prairie with a  crystal blue light as its smooth, icy face grew over the shrinking  rainforests behind them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto’s arm snaked out to rest around  Ami’s waist. Jupiter was her home, and to see such sights was nothing  new to her. She was as easily taken by the Mercurian’s beauty as the  electric blue light of the aurora borealis mingled with her cobalt eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still  nearly standing on top of Rei from when they’d stopped, Minako  tentatively reached out for the Martian’s hand and offered her an  unsteady smile. “I guess we should… keep going, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ye… yeah.”  Rei replied. And when she found herself lacing her fingers with the  Venusian’s, she was rewarded with a full blown smile from the other  woman.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re not far now.” Ami said analytically, tearing her  eyes from first the majestic display of nature, and then the less  majestic yet equally as touching display between the two women, to her  transparent read out that hovered before her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And the Mercurian  was right; that magical moment couldn’t last forever. The four women  had found the teleport circuit all too soon, and the gentle, reverent  mood was broken, for standing around its metal confines, it was time to  get serious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With cold frowns on stern faces, Rei, Minako, Ami  and Makoto went into warrior mode as they prepared themselves for what  awaited them at Jupiter’s pole.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The winds screamed like a lover scorned.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  tore across the flat valley so fast that the hazy, driving snow  couldn’t find purchase, and served only to threaten frostbite to what  skin was exposed on the women’s faces.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After donning protective  layers of clothing, their packs had been abandoned at the teleport  circuit, but they were quick to find that no amount of clothing could  fully protect them from the wrath of Jupiter’s pole.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still, the  four warriors plodded forward. Rei took the lead, a spiritual guide  with a hankering for youma cutting a path through the snows. Minako  trailed closely behind, both longing for the warmth of the animal skin  and physical closeness they’d shared back on Mars’ pole, and careful to  watch the Priestess for any sign of fatigue. At the moment, the hardy  Martian seemed unstoppable. A quick glance over her shoulder confirmed  that Makoto and Ami were still up to the challenge.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The center of the pole’s just up ahead.” Makoto called out over the winds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How do you know?” Minako demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See  that vortex?” Ami asked, pointing to an eerie, cloudless void of fading  aural activity where the light of dawn filtered through the swirling  clouds was only beginning to banish the night’s darkness. “It’s a  hexagon of high altitude haze that surrounds the polar region.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then, if the youma are here, they should be under that vortex.” Minako concluded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami nodded. “Hypothetically.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto cracked her knuckles. “Then lets-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait!” All eyes turned to the Priestess. “Scouting party!” She barked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  unstrung her bow and notched an arrow in a fluid motion, aiming it into  the emptiness ahead, and the bright, golden light she associated with  Minako’s senshi transformation enveloped the Venusian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako stood before the women as Sailor Venus and urgently turned to her other two senshi. “Don’t doubt her – transform <em>now</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Blue  and green glows, not too dissimilar from Minako’s own, enveloped Makoto  and Ami respectively. From the corner of her eye, Rei allowed herself a  sideways glance of Jupiter and Mercury. Despite the foolishly scant  costumes they donned, she expected them to be nearly as formidable as  Venus herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took a few seconds longer than she’d expected,  but finally, a dozen of the loathsome creatures haphazardly appeared on  the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei’s right.” Mercury said hurriedly, examining  their foes through a translucent blue screen across her eyes. “It’s a  scouting party. The odds are three to one, but they don’t know we’re  here yet. If we attack first, we’ll hold the element of surprise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Strategist.’</em> Rei realized.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jupiter snorted. She flexed her hand and a brilliant arc of lightening appeared. “Then what are we waiting for, lets get them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Brute force.’</em> The Priestess noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jupiter,  you’re with me.” Venus said, and her warriors gave her their utmost  attention. “We work best with our close range attacks. Rei and Mercury,  you hang back. We’ll depend on the two of you to take out as many as  possible with your long range attacks before we get up close and  personal with those ugly bastards.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei smirked. <em>‘Commander.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jupiter and Venus were off and running.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury  chuckled and flexed her gloved hands. A spray of bubbles filled her  palms. “It’s never easy to see the ones you care for run off into  danger, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s arrow faltered in the slightest. She chose silence, and righted her aim.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After several calculations, cobalt eyes narrowed. “Now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury  released a lethal spray of razor sharp bubbles. Hot on the trail of the  elemental attack, an arrow cut through the air, followed by another,  and then another, the sound of Rei’s bow snapping tensely with each  projectile fired in rapid succession.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Four of the youma collapsed  before the scouting party had even detected the threat. The dumb  creatures saw the golden and green warriors first, their courageous  charge demanding their attention, even as two more of the numbers were  culled by a Shabon Spray and a succession of three arrows to the skull  of the other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Six left!” Venus shouted with a manic grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jupiter chuckled heartily. “Three for you and three for me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  chain that had hung around the golden warrior’s waist was in her hands  and glowing with an eager light. “I’m aiming for something more like  sixty/forty!” She exclaimed as the chain snaked out and wrapped around  a monster’s thick neck. She ran behind it and pulled, and it hit the  frozen ground with a crash as Jupiter delivered a roundhouse kick  between the red, beady eyes of another.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Showoff!” Rei snarled as  her eyes tracked Venus’ movements, even as she dropped another youma  with another round of the last of her arrows. “I’m out!” She barked to  Mercury, who deftly took out the next of three remaining youma.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  Rei’s observation had been right. Venus leapt from the chest of the  youma she’d not only dropped but had run through the chest with her  sword, flying through the air recklessly, limbs akimbo in the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Behind  you!” Rei shouted, even as the youma she’d dropped earlier rose to  shaky feet at the discovery that its wound had not been nearly as fatal  as Venus had intended.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But her words would never reach the  Venusian in time, and neither would Jupiter; the tall brunette’s fist  sparkled with lightening as she sparred with one of two remaining  intact youma.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The image of the rising youma pulling the sword  from the remains of its chest and rushing Venus from behind burned  itself into the Martian’s retina…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A surge of power sparked deep within her. Instinct grabbed her and the Priestess embraced it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She raised her bow, drew back the empty string and aimed…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  was suddenly looking down through the sight of a flaming arrow. It felt  natural, like an extension of herself, but refusing to be captured by  the wonder, she focused her sight on the youma who charged after Venus…  and released it.</span></p>
‘Please…’
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even as the golden warrior thrust her sword deep into the heart of  the youma in front of her, the body of another fell beside her,  clipping her shoulder with its sharp claws and narrowly missed taking  her body to the ground with it. She recognized it as her first victim  that hadn’t been dead after all…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And imbedded in the back of its skull, a flaming arrow winked out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?”  She asked, her eyes darting to the other end of the battlefield where  the raven haired warrior lowered her empty bow. Their gazes leveled on  one another, and before she was even aware of it, Venus had taken to  her feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She sprinted past Mercury, each woman dashing in  opposite directions with different targets. All too soon, the leader of  the senshi was standing before the Martian in baited silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  avoided the obvious. “Shouldn’t you have that looked at?” She pointed  to the ugly wound left by the youma’s claws. It wasn’t deep, but it  must have been painful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus looked to her shoulder. She looked  back at Rei. Her golden light enveloped her once more. Venus Minako was  left in its wake, clad in her winter gear. The woman tugged at the  collar of her heavy jacket, revealing the wound. Rei gasped. The skin  was slowly mending itself right before her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had questions, but so did Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was that.” She demanded almost coldly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t play dumb with me, Rei. How did create that fire-arrow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess faltered. She’d like to know the answer to that question  herself. “I… don’t know.” She whispered, her voice rising in volume  quickly. “It just happened!” There had been no time to analyze the  situation; she’d acted on instinct. She didn’t even know if she could  access that wonderful, frightening power again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two women stared at each other. The wind howled through the small gap left between their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mina-chan! Rei-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two turned to Makoto, and the tall warrior pointed urgently to a slight rise in the distance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei looked back to Minako and nodded, for she knew.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The youma base was just over that rise.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  frozen ground was colder than the air itself, yet the four women lay  flat on their bellies as they peered over the rise to avoid detection.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Underneath  the atmospheric void of the pole, a gathering of youma that rivaled  what Minako and Rei had found on Mars was a bustling city of youma.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait.” Ami said distractedly, analyzing the data her VR goggles relayed to her. “It’s not just youma…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s brows furrowed. She squinted and sent a part of her consciousness out and over the youma camp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see… people.” The Mercurian said, magnifying her goggles to show her  the center of the youma camp. A small projection appeared before the  four warriors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Victims?” Rei asked. “They feed off of, and gather life energy-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. They’re alive.” Ami’s cryptic response was more than unsettling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  grainy projection blurred, and then refocused. Amongst the foul  creatures, surrounding the access point from which more and more of the  disposable monster soldiers appeared, were five other forms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Their signatures are weak.” Ami said hurriedly as she analyzed their astral footprints. She gasped. “They might be-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Humans</em>.” Rei spat with no small amount of derision. “I can sense it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Earthlings?” Makoto’s whispered words were telling. “Ami?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The petite woman could only nod darkly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako snorted. “Serenity won’t be happy about this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Queen?” Rei asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the Princess.” Minako confirmed.</span></p>

Author’s Notes:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This chapter  lays the groundwork for several threads to be explored in upcoming  chapters.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By the way, the youma that I’m using are direct copies  of the youma that appeared early on in the Sailor Moon S arc, like the  one that attacked when Haruka first accepted her henshin wand. They  were by far the ugliest of the monsters, and somehow, the most  realistic in terms of actually looking like monsters.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I also have  to admit that I took the easy way out with Ami and Makoto’s  relationship by having them already be an item before the story  started. I’m not as comfortable writing them, and since they weren’t  the main focus of the storyline, I cheated a little by having them  already be together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mina-chan, shouldn’t you be with the others? I thought the four of you were going to develop a plan for your next mission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  I’ll join them soon.” Plans had already started to form in the  Venusian’s mind, but they could wait for the moment. Minako stepped  closer to her Princess. “I… hope you don’t mind, Serenity-chan, but,  there is a question I’d like to ask.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity took Minako’s hands. “Anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian’s shoulders stiffened and their hands became quite  interesting. “When we attacked the scouting party on Jupiter’s pole,  Rei ran out of arrows,” a lengthy pause ensued and Serenity did not  press the matter. Minako finally met her Princess’ gaze, “but she saved  me with an arrow born of-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shh.” The Princess of the Moon  pressed a finger to her senshi’s lips and when Minako looked to her in  question, her sweet smile somehow set the other woman at ease.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s supposed to be this way, Mina-chan.” She smiled sagely. “Now, your friends are waiting for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">(preview, part 2)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People are <em>watching</em>.” She finally hissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  sucked her teeth noisily. “Let them.” She met Rei’s amethyst eyes with  no small amount of amusement. “Unless you could honestly say that <em>you</em> wouldn’t appreciate two beautiful women walking down the street arm in arm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snorted and looked away. Minako won.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides,<em> I</em> think you like it.” She said smugly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or maybe I just don’t have a free hand to ward off your drunken advances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian chuckled. “Aren’t we doing this all backwards?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t the sober one supposed to take advantage of the drunken one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hate to break this to you, Minako, but it’s not seduction if you tell the other party what you’re doing.”</span></p>
