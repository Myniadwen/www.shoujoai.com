<pre>	&quot;Stop looking at me like that.&quot;
	Minako grinned from her seat on the floor.  &quot;Like what?&quot;  Rei 
glared at her.  &quot;Like that.&quot;
	&quot;Why Rei, whatever do you mean?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m serious Mina.  I told you already, we just can&#39;t today.&quot;  
Mina pouted.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to be so mean about it...&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not being mean!&quot;  Rei paused and sighed.  &quot;And stop pouting.&quot;  
	Mina pouted more and her bottom lip began to tremble.  Rei just 
shook her head and gave in; first making sure the door was closed, then 
gently putting her arms around the blonde.  Mina grinned, pressing her 
body deeper into Rei&#39;s. 
	&quot;You&#39;re such an actress.&quot;
	&quot;Mmm hmmm...  Rei, look at me.&quot;  The miko reluctantly peered into 
Minako&#39;s eyes.  
	&quot;I love you.&quot; she whispered before pressing her lips firmly 
against her best friend&#39;s.  
	The squeak and slide of an opening door reminded the two that 
their time together was limited.  Rei cursed under her breath and pulled 
from Minako hurredly, inadvertedly pushing the girl to the floor.  She 
just lay there as three other teenagers and two cats entered Rei&#39;s room.
	&quot;Hi Rei-- Oh Mina! I almost stepped on you, why are you lying on 
the floor?&quot;  Usagi asked, alongside Ami and Makoto.  Mina&#39;s eyes were 
closed and she sighed deeply.
	&quot;I dunno.  Maybe I&#39;m tired.&quot;
	&quot;You should take a quick nap if you&#39;re that tired.&quot; Makoto 
suggested.
	&quot;Maybe...  Excuse me.&quot; she said, rushing out of the room.  Ami, 
Makoto, and Usagi, turned from watching Mina&#39;s back to staring at the 
top of Rei&#39;s head.  The miko&#39;s head was ducked and she was concentrated 
on a spot on the floor.
	&quot;Rei...&quot;  Her head snapped.  &quot;What?  Are we gonna study or just 
stand around?&quot;
	&quot;Sure, sure Rei, I&#39;ll just get some snacks for us okay?&quot;  Makoto 
said, turning worried eyes towards the direction Minako left in.  Rei 
huffed and glared at the other two, left awkwardly standing with their 
books in hand.  Usagi and Ami gave each other concerned glances and sat 
down with Rei to study.  
	Minako stiffened and brushed away errant tears from her eyes 
nonchalantly, as soon as she felt Makoto coming up behind her on the 
front porch.
	&quot;Mina-chan...&quot;  The blonde&#39;s head turned slightly to face her 
friend, but her eyes still focused on some far off object.
	&quot;Hey Mako-chan.&quot;
	&quot;Ummm, what&#39;s up?&quot;  
	&quot;Same old, same old.&quot; she half-whispered, with some bite in it.  
Makoto sighed, and looked towards the far off object.  
	&quot;So you&#39;re not gonna tell me what&#39;s bothering you?&quot;
	Mina finally broke her stare and looked at her friend.
	&quot;There&#39;s nothing bothering me.&quot;
	&quot;Y&#39;know it hurts when you lie to your best friend.&quot;
	&quot;Mako-chan...  I&#39;ve just been in a bad mood, that&#39;s all.&quot;
	Makoto scratched her head, trying to piece together things in her 
mind.  &quot;That&#39;s just the thing, Mina-chan, lately you&#39;ve been in a bad 
mood a lot.  Well, a lot more than we&#39;re used to from you.&quot; Makoto 
chuckled.  &quot;We expect these sorts of mood swings from Rei.&quot;
	The way Minako&#39;s eyes darted into Makoto&#39;s seemed to shake her 
soul.  She had to blink a few times before she continued.  &quot;I mean, 
you&#39;ve been so up and down lately, it&#39;s becoming kinda concerning.  For 
instance, yesterday when I talked to you on the phone you said you slept 
over Rei&#39;s house and you two had a great time and then when you came to 
the Crown that afternoon you looked, I dunno, kinda dejected.&quot;
	&quot;Dejected?&quot;  Mina thought back to why she would feel like that on 
that particular afternoon.  &quot;Oh, yeah...&quot; She and Rei had a slight 
contradiction during the walk there. &quot;Can&#39;t even hold hands...&quot; she spat 
under her breath.
	&quot;What?&quot;
	&quot;Nothing.&quot;
	&quot;No, you said something about hands.&quot;
	&quot;No I didn&#39;t.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, sure.  But do you get it?  What&#39;s been going on?&quot;  Minako 
furrowed her eyebrows and looked at Makoto and then out to the distance.
	&quot;Mako-chan, you&#39;ve been in a serious relationship right?&quot;  Makoto 
was a bit thrown by the question.
	&quot;Wha?  Uhh, yeah, actually I have.  My old sempai was--&quot; Minako 
cut her off.  	&quot;Suppose you were in a relationship with a person 
who you care deeply about.  Suppose that you had to keep this 
relationship a secret.  Suppose that this made you very unhappy, 
although it kept you with the person you cared about indefinitely, 
opposed to if it wasn&#39;t a secret, where there would be a chance, a 
slight chance, that you may be kept apart because of the, ummm, nature 
of this person you cared about.  What would you do?  Keep the secret to 
keep the person happy for a silly reason or spill and make the person 
unhappy and maybe risk everything for a damn good reason. Hmm?&quot;
	Makoto blinked a few times.  &quot;Aino Minako... Are you seeing a 
married man?&quot;
	Minako slapped her forehead.  &quot;No, I just...  Just answer the 
question.&quot;
	&quot;Well I guess it would depend on the &#39;reason&#39; that you speak of.&quot;
	&quot;Suppose the reason, in your mind, wasn&#39;t good enough to keep the 
secret.&quot;
	&quot;I guess I wouldn&#39;t keep it anymore then.&quot;
	&quot;Risking making this person unhappy and blowing the entire 
relationship?&quot;  
	&quot;Well when you put it that way, then I&#39;d keep the secret.&quot;
	&quot;But it made you unhappy and put a strain on the relationship...&quot;
	Makoto shook her head and flailed her arms in the air, attempting 
to knock away the brainteasers.
	&quot;Jeese, I dunno Minako, shouldn&#39;t you know all this, Ms. Goddess 
of Love?&quot;
	Minako&#39;s face became thoughtful.  &quot;You&#39;re absolutely right.  I am 
the Goddess of Love.  Thanks a lot Mako-chan.&quot;
	Makoto became confused as she watched the blond waltz back to 
Rei&#39;s room.
	&quot;Hey!  Wait!  What was all that about?!&quot;


	Rei watched her girlfriend attentively throughout the study 
session.  She had realized what she did and guilt compressed her heart.  
She had been inadvertently hurting Minako lately and although it seemed 
like she didn&#39;t realize it, she did, and it hurt her as much to be doing 
that to someone she loved.  She tried to will Minako to make eye contact 
with her, but the blonde would only briefly meet her eyes before 
fluttering away teasingly.  Rei knew she deserved this at least, but it 
annoyed her to be left wondering if Minako&#39;s suddenly bright mood was 
only a facade.  She&#39;d have to wait.  
	&quot;See you tomorrow Rei-chan!&quot;  Usagi waved as she and Ami and 
Makoto prepared to leave.  &quot;Hey Mina-chan, aren&#39;t you coming?&quot;
	&quot;In a minute Usagi, I can&#39;t find my notebook...&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s in the kitchen. I&#39;ll get it for you.&quot;  Rei offered.
	&quot;Okay.&quot;
	Rei took one step and realized Minako wasn&#39;t following her.  &quot;Are 
you coming?&quot;
	&quot;For what?&quot;  She smiled innocently at Rei who in turn gave her an 
agitated look.  
	&quot;To make sure it&#39;s your notebook.&quot;  With that she grabbed the 
blonde&#39;s hand and pulled her into the kitchen.  
	&quot;Jeese Rei. It&#39;s just a notebook...&quot;
	&quot;No it&#39;s not just the notebook.&quot;  The miko sighed and ran a hand 
through her thick hair.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, okay?&quot;
	&quot;Sorry for...?&quot;
	&quot;Mina.  You know what I&#39;m talking about.  And I&#39;m sorry.  Alright?  
That&#39;s the last time I&#39;m going to say it because I promise it&#39;ll never 
happen again.&quot;  
	Minako looked away and considered Rei&#39;s apology.  The fact that 
she was getting an apology at all from Hino Rei was incredible.  Her 
hand found Rei&#39;s and she decided that was all she needed.  
	&quot;It&#39;s okay.  It&#39;s just that... I dunno.  Sometimes it feels like 
you...&quot;
	&quot;Like I what?&quot;
	&quot;Mina-chan!  Didya find it, we&#39;re ready to leave!&quot;
	Minako shook her head and gave her girlfriend a quick kiss on the 
cheek.
	&quot;I&#39;ll talk to you tomorrow.  Love you.&quot;
	Rei watched her leave and started to miss her already.  &quot;Love you 
too.&quot;  She said to no one.

	The tossing and turning she had done all night wasn&#39;t the kind Rei 
appreciated, and her friends could tell she hadn&#39;t woken up on the right 
side of the bed, if such a thing existed for the temperamental miko.  So 
they wisely avoided eye contact and mumbled their greetings, only hoping 
that the storm in her eyes would pass, as they took up their customary 
walk to school.
	Minako slowed her pace to walk beside her, trying to get her 
attention somehow without the others noticing.  Rei was normally grumpy 
in the mornings, but today it seemed like her petulance was aimed in her 
direction.  Her arm casually brushed against Rei&#39;s, causing the miko to 
visibly stiffen.  
	Without thinking her eyes snapped on Rei&#39;s and she glared at her.  
	&quot;What is your problem?&quot; she whispered harshly, at this point not 
caring if the others heard.  
	Rei&#39;s deep eyes shifted around uncomfortably, certain that at the 
least Usagi&#39;s ears were perked up and listening.  She faced in front of 
her and stared at the back of Makoto&#39;s head, knowing Minako was burning 
a whole in to the side of her face with her eyes.  
	&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; she replied nonchalantly, trying to 
focus her eyes on Makoto&#39;s ponytail swaying in front of her.  She didn&#39;t 
want to look at Minako at the moment.  
	Minako&#39;s eyes narrowed and her mouth moved as if she wanted to say 
something more, but wouldn&#39;t say it.  
	Usagi, Ami, and Makoto stopped suddenly, causing Rei to walk smack 
into Makoto&#39;s back.  
	&quot;Oof-Wha?&quot;
	&quot;Bye Rei!  See ya after school!&quot; Usagi said waving, as did Ami and 
Makoto, making Rei realize they had arrived at her school.  
	&quot;Oh yeah...  Bye guys.&quot; She weakly waved back, noticing Minako 
already walking in the opposite direction.  
	With furrowed eyebrows and stress already apparent on her face, 
she stalked into T&amp;A, glowering past meek underclassmen who yelped as 
they got out of the way.

	Minako grew more and more upset each minute that she thought about 
her girlfriend&#39;s behavior that morning.  She had no idea where the 
sudden and uncalled for attitude had come from.  Just the thought of how 
Rei acted made her screech and pound her fist on the desk.  
Unfortunately no one could sympathize since they were all in the middle 
of a math lesson.  
	&quot;Aino?&quot; the elderly algebra teacher questioned, giving her a 
puzzled look, along with Usagi and Ami and the entire class.
	She put on her best pseudo-smile and laughed nervously.  &quot;Sorry 
Sensei!  This, &quot; She quickly looked at Ami&#39;s notebook to see what they 
were supposed to be learning, &quot;this remainder theorem is killer.&quot;  
	&quot;Well, you&#39;d better find some help before the test.&quot;  The teacher 
turned back to the blackboard and continued with his lesson, allowing 
Minako to release a relieved sigh.  
	She dismissed Usagi and Ami&#39;s questioning looks with quick thumbs 
up and put her chin in her hand and tried to focus on the remainder 
theorem for the rest of the period, lest she start thinking about Rei 
again and work herself into a rage in front of the whole class.
	
	&quot;Where&#39;s Minako?&quot; Rei asked immediately upon noticing only Usagi, 
Ami, and Makoto arriving at the shrine.  
	&quot;Hello to you too,&quot; Makoto&#39;s sarcasm served to embarrass Rei, but 
she answered her question, &quot;She said she wasn&#39;t feeling well, and 
thought she&#39;d be better off skipping today&#39;s meeting.&quot;  
	&quot;Which is unfortunate, since she was having trouble with the 
remainder theorem in class today,&quot; Ami said, scratching her chin 
thoughtfully, &quot;But she did seem very distraught over something.&quot;  
	Rei remained quiet as they took their seats at the table in her 
room.  It wasn&#39;t beyond her that she was a bit too unkind to Minako in 
the morning.  But the feeling Minako left her with the night before 
seemed like a good enough reason to be a little cross with her at the 
time.  But now she knew she was in trouble, and this time her usually 
merciful girlfriend would not be so gracious.  There was only one thing 
she could do to make things right, and she cursed gently under her 
breath as she realized what had to be done.  
	Running a shaky hand through her thick hair, she inhaled and 
exhaled deeply before addressing her friends.
	&quot;Listen you guys,&quot; her serious tone caught the attention of her 
three fellow senshi quickly, &quot;There&#39;s something you need to know.&quot;

	Artemis purred and rubbed his coat against her ankles with all his 
might, but he could not get his master out of her miserable state.  She 
just continued to sigh deeply and stare out the window.  
	&quot;Oh come on Minako!&quot; he yelled, jumping up onto the window sill.  
&quot;You can&#39;t sit around like this all day.  At least tell me what&#39;s 
bothering you.&quot;
	Minako picked him up and scratched his head, grateful that she had 
him around when she couldn&#39;t talk to anyone else.  &quot;It&#39;s Rei,&quot; she 
finally told him.  
	Artemis tried not to roll his eyes.  He truly did sympathize, but 
it seemed like lately those two were fighting everyday.  And since he 
had disagreed with the whole thing in the beginning, it became more 
difficult to suppress the urge to blurt out &quot;I told you so!&quot;  
	But he only shook his head and jumped out of her arms.
	&quot;I just hope you&#39;re not getting hurt.  It wouldn&#39;t be ideal to 
have you grieving a broken heart or being emotionally torn by someone 
you have to protect and be protected by everyday.  Above all else, you 
have to remember that first you two are senshis and then...&quot; he said the 
word slowly and with obvious distaste, &quot;girlfriends.&quot;
	&quot;Lovers,&quot; she corrected him with a grin.  Underneath all that 
senshi talk, she knew Artemis was concerned the most with Minako and not 
Sailor Venus when it came to Rei.
	Resuming her aimless habit, she put her chin in her hand and gazed 
through the window once more.  A person approaching her house caught her 
eye.
	&quot;Kami, &quot;she sighed, &quot;Is she serious?&quot;
	She got up suddenly and left the room, causing Artemis to sigh as 
he left his comfortable position and follow her.  

	For the fiftieth time Rei asked herself what she was doing and for 
the fiftieth time she rationalized with herself.  She smiled meekly when 
Minako swung open her front door and glared at her.  Minako was the 
first to speak since Rei couldn&#39;t find her voice.  
	&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; There was just a hint of anger in her 
voice.
	Rei raised her eyes from her feet to look at Minako, for the first 
time that day.  &quot;We need to talk.&quot;  Her own voice was steadier than she 
imagined it to be.
	&quot;Oh?  So now you want to talk?  This morning you completely blew 
me off and now we need to talk?&quot; 
	Artemis padded silently beside her and upon seeing Rei nudged her 
with his head in an attempt to soothe her oncoming anger.  
	Rei sighed and tried not to become impatient.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry about 
that.  I had a lot on my mind.&quot;
	&quot;That doesn&#39;t make things any better, Rei.&quot;
	&quot;I know, but hear me out.  I was thinking about a lot of things 
last night, including you and me,&quot; Minako tilted her head as she 
listened to Rei, wondering where she was going with this.  &quot;I know what 
you want to happen, and for a long time I wasn&#39;t ready for it to happen, 
and I&#39;m still not.  But it&#39;s for the best, so...&quot;
	&quot;So... What do you mean?&quot; Minako asked cautiously, not willing to 
get her hopes up, even though she took a few steps closer to Rei.  
	Rei smiled, hoping she was doing the right thing, and seeing 
Minako&#39;s face she knew she was.  &quot;I mean,&quot; she took out her communicator 
and opened it, showing Usagi, Ami, and Makoto, all gathered and peering 
into Ami&#39;s communicator at the shrine.  &quot;This is what I couldn&#39;t tell 
you guys.  I have to show you.&quot; 
	Before Minako could react Rei was kissing her and there was gasps 
emitting from the communicator.  This kiss was gentle and affectionate, 
made sweeter when Minako finally realized what Rei was doing.  She was 
outing them.  
	They clung to each other while catching their breath, then 
remembered what the point of it was.  Apprehensively they turned their 
eyes on the communicator and braced their selves.
	Not one of them uttered a word.  They seemed as if they were 
petrified and were unable to move.  All of their eyes were wide, two 
mouths hung open, and one bore a slight smile.  
	Makoto found her voice first.  &quot;Ho... ly... shi-&quot;
 	&quot;Implausible...&quot; Ami muttered.  &quot;I never would have guessed...&quot;  
She seemed to still be grasping the concept of what had just occurred.
	&quot;I can&#39;t believe it, &quot; Usagi finally murmured. &quot;I always thought 
Rei had a thing for me.&quot;
	Minako and Rei did all they could to keep from falling over, while 
Ami and Makoto turned their shocked gazes on her.  
	&quot;What?  Don&#39;t tell me you all didn&#39;t think so too?&quot;
	Rei balked.  &quot;I didn&#39;t!&quot;
	&quot;I can see what you mean Usagi,&quot; Minako ignored the look Rei gave 
her.  &quot;But she&#39;s mine.&quot;
	Usagi giggled at the scene on Ami&#39;s communicator.  &quot;I don&#39;t think 
Mamo-chan would appreciate that very much... or maybe he would?  I did 
find these really ecchi magazines under his bed one day-&quot;
	&quot;Usagi!&quot; Rei cut her off.  &quot;No one wants to know.  But Mina and I, 
you guys are okay with it, right?&quot;
	Usagi&#39;s smile took up the entire communicator screen, easing the 
anxiety in Rei&#39;s chest.  &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t we be?  I&#39;m perfectly fine with 
it, and Ami-chan and Mako-chan,&quot; she elbowed Makoto to get her and Ami 
out of their dazed stupor.  
	&quot;Oh sure, sure, sure,&quot; Makoto assured them.  &quot;At least you&#39;re not 
with a married man, Mina-chan.&quot;
	Minako had to ignore the inquisitive look Rei shot her after that 
comment.
	Ami took a minute to collect her thoughts before speaking.  &quot;It 
will take some time to get used to.  But I see no objection.&quot;
	&quot;Good. I&#39;m glad you all have no objections,&quot; Artemis said, jumping 
onto Minako&#39;s shoulder and addressing the communicator.  &quot;Then it&#39;ll be 
easier to explain it to Luna.&quot;
	 &quot;Oh stop ruining the moment Artemis,&quot; Minako said, shaking him 
off.
	&quot;We&#39;ll have to get back to our studying,&quot; Ami informed them, 
always the one to bring up schoolwork.  &quot;Rei, are you coming back or 
should we move to another location?&quot;
	Rei looked at Minako, who smirked at her.  She took the 
communicator from Rei and answered, &quot;You should definitely move 
Ami-chan.&quot;  With that she shut down the communicator and with an impish 
smile pulled Rei by the front of her shirt in to the house, slamming the 
door in Artemis&#39; face.  
	&quot;As long as they&#39;re in there, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m out here.&quot; He sighed 
and settled down to take a nap in the sun.

	&quot;Okaaaay,&quot; Makoto rubbed her face and paced around her living 
room, where the three of them had relocated to.  &quot;That was a bit of a 
shocker.&quot;
	Ami tapped her chin thoughtfully with the end of a pencil.  &quot;It&#39;s 
fairly obvious when you think about it.  Their behavior lately was 
rather unusual.  This morning, for example.&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re right Ami-chan!&quot; Usagi piped, spewing crumbs of Makoto&#39;s 
home baked cookies.  &quot;It sounded like they were having a fight or 
something this morning.  That&#39;s why Mina-chan didn&#39;t want to come to the 
meeting today!&quot;
	Makoto plopped down on the couch and put her feet up on the coffee 
table.  &quot;I bet they&#39;re not fighting anymore,&quot; she chuckled, making Usagi 
almost choke on her cookie and Ami&#39;s ears turn red.  
	Usagi&#39;s eyebrows furrowed as she became contemplative.  &quot;Mako-chan 
do you mean...  They don&#39;t actually do... that stuff... do you think?&quot;
	Makoto grinned as she watched Ami turn progressively more crimson.  
&quot;Who knows?  But I think we should cut this talk out, they&#39;d kill us.  
And Ami-chan might die if anymore blood rushes to her head.&quot;
	Ami startled when she heard her name.  &quot;It&#39;s just a little 
inappropriate.&quot;  
	&quot;But would you have guessed?&quot; Usagi exclaimed excitedly.  
&quot;Mina-chan&#39;s so boy crazy and Rei&#39;s so... not a lesbian.&quot;
	Makoto and Ami looked at her with perplexity.  
	&quot;How do you figure?  I mean, you thought she liked you!&quot;  Makoto 
pointed out, with some amusement. 
	&quot;Well she went out with Mamo-chan, so it would make sense that 
she&#39;d like me!  It&#39;s something they call it...&quot;
	&quot;Displacement.&quot;  Ami clarified.  &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what 
happened.&quot;
	&quot;Is it so hard to believe that they just fell for each other?&quot; 
Makoto asked seriously.
	The three of them looked at each other and pondered the question.
	Usagi shrugged.  &quot;They&#39;d have pretty babies.&quot;
	Neither Makoto nor Ami bothered to comment.

	The dark eyed beauty practically kicked up her heels as she walked 
home from Minako&#39;s house, much spring in her step.  She was lighter, 
untroubled, generally happy, since revealing their secret to their 
friends two weeks ago.  It was apparent what the cause of her and 
Minako&#39;s problems had been and now that it wasn&#39;t a factor anymore, they 
lived in utter bliss.  The youma attacks had been sparse lately, and 
those that happened weren&#39;t much of a challenge.  Life was good.  
	&quot;I&#39;m home Grandpa,&quot; Rei called out upon entering the shrine and 
seeing the old man in the kitchen.  She smiled at him and kissed the top 
of his bald head.  
	He chuckled at her, somewhat rare, exuberance.  &quot;What gives you 
such high spirits today, my child?&quot;  He asked, putting a bowl of 
potatoes in front of her to peel.  
	Her smile faltered slightly at the task she was presented with, 
but shone again as she answered him.  &quot;I just feel good, Grandpa.&quot;
	&quot;And what is making you feel this good?&quot; 
	Rei raised an eyebrow at his sudden curiosity in her mood.  &quot;Uh, I 
don&#39;t know Grandpa.  It feels like... I&#39;m living again.&quot;
	&quot;You were not living?&quot;
	&quot;Something like that,&quot; Rei took a good look at the old man.  He 
wasn&#39;t really her parent, but he was the closest thing she had; with her 
mother gone and her father, who might as well be.  If her best friends 
took it easily, then he would too.  He understood her.  &quot;Grandpa, I was 
at Minako&#39;s house.  That&#39;s where I just came from.&quot;
	&quot;Yes?  Minako is the one with the bow?&quot; He asked, but Rei knew it 
was a front.  He used to leer at her the most.  
	&quot;That&#39;s her.  You like her right?&quot;
	&quot;She&#39;s a nice girl.  Very vibrant.  And pretty, very pretty.&quot;
	Rei took a deep breath.  &quot;Um...  I&#39;m seeing her, Grandpa.&quot;
	&quot;Mm hmm.&quot;  Rei waited for a follow-up to this non-syllabic answer, 
but none was forthcoming.  He just continued to chop vegetables and stir 
the boiling pot of rice.  
	&quot;Grandpa?  Don&#39;t you have... a reaction?&quot;
	The old man looked at her once and then turned back to his pot.  
&quot;Reaction to what my dear?&quot;
	Rei was baffled.  &quot;To what I just told you!  I&#39;m seeing Minako!&quot;
	He chuckled at that, making Rei question the possibility of 
senility in the elder priest.  &quot;I see Minako too, my dear.  We all see 
her.  Do you mean you see her right now?   Because she isn&#39;t here.  And 
that would be a problem.  But you are healthy aren&#39;t you?  You don&#39;t 
look feverish.  Perhaps if you ate those mushrooms that were leftover 
from last night, it would have that effect.  Or...&quot; He looked at her 
suddenly, &quot;Rei are you doing drugs?&quot;
	Rei looked at him blankly.  Slowly she erupted.  &quot;What?!  NO!  
Grandpa, don&#39;t you get it?  I&#39;m not seeing her right now, but I&#39;m seeing 
her.  Like, SEEING her.  I&#39;m with her Grandpa.&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re with her?&quot;  The old man sighed.  &quot;Rei, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d 
have to talk to you about such things.  Drugs are bad-&quot;
	&quot;NO!  GRANPA I&#39;M NOT ON DRUGS!!&quot;  Rei flailed around with a potato 
and knife in hand, trying to get through to the old-timer.  She put the 
vegetable and potential weapon down slowly and breathed calmly.  After 
she was composed again, she attempted to be straightforward with him.  
&quot;Grandpa listen to me.  Minako and I are together, meaning I&#39;m not 
hallucinating about her right now.  She&#39;s my... girlfriend.&quot;  The look 
on the elder priests face showed that he needed more explanation.  Rei 
tried to be as simple as possible.  &quot;If she was a guy, she&#39;d be my 
boyfriend.  But she is a girl, therefore she is my girlfriend.  Do you 
get it?  We&#39;re... involved.&quot;
	Enlightenment dawned on the old man&#39;s face.  &quot;Are you telling 
that, you are... romantic, with this girl?&quot;
	Rei closed her eyes and nodded.  &quot;Yes.&quot;
	He looked suddenly weaker than she ever saw him, and helped him 
over to a chair.  He leaned his bald head on a propped up hand and shook 
it solemnly.  &quot;Great grandchildren...&quot;
	&quot;Grandpa, talk to me.&quot;
	Rei kneeled down near him and he put an encouraging hand on her 
head.  &quot;This is unexpected.&quot;
	Rei nodded and took his hand.  &quot;It&#39;s alright Grandpa.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s not though, my child.  I&#39;m your guardian.  But your 
father...  He will not be pleased.&quot;
	Rei shrugged.  She figured he was so far removed from her life 
anyway that it wouldn&#39;t matter either way.  &quot;We don&#39;t have to tell him.&quot;
	The old man shook his head.  &quot;I can&#39;t do that.  I owe it to him 
and your mother.  He wished for you...&quot;
	&quot;What Grandpa?&quot;
	He patted her head as he frowned.  &quot;He wants you to marry soon.&quot;
	Rei was stunned.  A skeptical eyebrow rose.  &quot;Are you kidding?  He 
wasn&#39;t serious.  I&#39;m seventeen!&quot;
	&quot;Your mother married him when she was nineteen.  He is looking for 
a-&quot;
	Rei jumped up and put her hands over her ears.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to 
hear anymore Grandpa.  That&#39;s ridiculous, he&#39;s ridiculous.  Can&#39;t even 
tell me that he&#39;s planning my future, when he&#39;s not even apart of my 
present.  It&#39;s stupid, and I don&#39;t want to hear another word about it.&quot;
	&quot;Rei,&quot; She sullenly looked over at her grandfather.  &quot;Think about 
what your mother would want.&quot;
	She looked at her feet and thought about it.  She arrived at the 
answer fairly easily as she thought about her mother.  &quot;I&#39;m in love 
Grandpa.  I know what she wants.&quot;
