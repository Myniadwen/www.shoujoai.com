&quot;Ladies and gentleman,&quot; the announcer&#39;s voice said, &quot;Once again, in the 
interest of fairness we offer a rebuttal to the omake series &#39;Mamoru 
Must Die&#39;.&quot;

A rather tall and somewhat muscular person in a blue dress comes out to 
stand in front of a set of curtains, a hastily put on black wig sat 
crookedly on his head and a suspicious five o&#39;clock shadow present.

&quot;Hello,&quot; the obvious man in drag said in a high squeaky voice, &quot;I&#39;m Rei, 
and I want to speak out against this series &#39;Mamoru Must Die!&#39; While I 
understand that there are some jerks... er, misguided but loveable fans 
out there that are fans of the Rei and Usagi pairing, killing off the 
handsome, brave and heroic Mamoru is just juvenile. All of you out there 
wanting Rei... er... me to be teamed with Usagi should be ashamed, 
especially when she already has such an incredibly wonderful, terrific 
chick magnet like Mamoru. I...&quot;

Makoto walked out from behind the curtain, her arms crossed and an 
annoyed look in her eyes, &quot;Mamoru, what in the hell are you doing?&quot;

The guy in drag grinned nervously as he sweatdropped, &quot;Mamoru?&quot; he asked 
in the same high pitched, squeaky voice, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean. 
I&#39;m Rei.&quot;

Makoto narrowed her eyes, &quot;That&#39;s funny.&quot; she said, &quot;We just found 
another young lady claiming to be Rei who has a lump on her head from 
where she was knocked out and who was tied up and left in her actor&#39;s 
trailer. You wouldn&#39;t happen to know anything about that would you, 
&#39;Rei&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Er... Well I... Hey, look over there!&quot; he said, pointing at something 
behind her. Makoto turned to look, and the man in drag ran for it. She 
then turned back angrily.

&quot;Mamoru, get back here!&quot; she yelled as she gave chase.

---Omake Seven: Grand Prix---

Pit row was slowly filling up with racecars as Haruka paced back and 
forth nervously. Mamoru, along with Michiru, Makoto and Ami, were down 
on the racetrack with Haruka&#39;s pit crew as the sandy blonde&#39;s team of 
mechanics went over her vehicle one last time.

&quot;Ruka, hon,&quot; Michiru said out of concern, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen you this 
nervous about a race before. You&#39;re practically shaking.&quot;

&quot;I... I know.&quot; the racecar driver acknowledged, &quot;But this isn&#39;t the 
junior circuit anymore. This is the big league. And the guys I&#39;m racing, 
they&#39;re legends Michi-chan. Legends!&quot;

&quot;Well, whoever they are,&quot; Mamoru offered, &quot;You know you have us here to 
offer out support.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Ami added.

&quot;Ditto!&quot; Makoto put in.

Haruka smiled at her friends and fellow Senshi; she was glad to have 
friends like them in her corner. She then looked up into the stands and 
saw Minako sitting with Rei and Usagi, the three young women holding up 
a banner reading &quot;Go Ruka!&quot; on it.

Then, with the sound of the engine that was pulling up behind her, all 
the joy sucked out of her. She turned to look at the legendary 
competition she&#39;d be facing...

------

&quot;Come on Sparky!&quot; Pops yelled, &quot;The Mach Five has to be up at peak 
performance for Speed to win this race against the mysterious Racer X 
and that new racer to the circuit Tenoh Haruka who is rumored to be one 
of the top up and comers which means the car has to be running perfectly 
for Speed to win!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t Worry.&quot; Sparky answered, &quot;I&#39;ve been working on the Mach Five now 
for the last twenty-four hour straight boy am I sleepy but I drank 
plenty of coffee to keep me awake and now I know the car&#39;s up to the 
challenge for Speed Racer to win this race against Racer X and Tenoh 
Haruka.&quot;

As Racer X&#39;s car number nine pulled into pit row behind the Mach Five, A 
young man with dashing good looks ran over to Pops and Sparky.

&quot;Hello Pops and Sparky I can&#39;t wait for the race to get started there 
sure are a lot of cars on the track today but I remember the two of you 
telling me that the two to watch out for were the mysterious Racer X and 
the new racer to the track Tenoh Haruka so it&#39;s a good thing Trixie will 
be up in her helicopter to help me out via radio because...&quot;

As Speed Racer continued talking, Michiru turned away. The artist had 
been listening in on the conversations taking place and now looked over 
to Haruka, only to find her beloved looking confused, &quot;Ruka love?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm?&quot; the blond asked.

&quot;You look puzzled about something.&quot;

&quot;I am. I&#39;m trying to figure something out Michi-chan.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; the artist asked.

&quot;Exactly how the fuck they can talk that long without taking a breath.&quot; 
the blond answered.

---One Hour Later---

Haruka was making good time around the curves, swerving through the 
competition until there were just two racers in front of her; Speed 
Racer in the lead and Racer X in second place. As they neared one of the 
tighter curves, Haruka managed to swerve by Racer X on the bottom of the 
track, moving her into second place behind Speed and his Mach Five.

It was then that the trunk of the Mach Five opened to reveal its two 
diminutive occupants; Speed Racer&#39;s younger brother Spritle, and the 
boy&#39;s pet chimpanzee Chim-Chim.

Spritle was alarmed, &quot;Oh no look Chim-Chim that new racer Haruka is 
gaining on speed and may end up overtaking him we have to do something 
to help out big brother but what can we do?&quot;

Chim-Chim, being a chimpanzee, did what any other chimpanzee in a 
similar situation would&#39;ve done. He put his hand behind himself, pooped, 
and flung the feces at the perceived threat in the car racing towards 
him and his human companions.

Unfortunately, the simian decided to use his disgusting act of 
self-defense just as Speed was passing by the judges, earning the racing 
legend an instant disqualification. Equally unfortunate was how easily 
Haruka was able to avoid the projectile. The disgusting missile, now 
traveling at high speeds and being born along by the winds caused by 
cars traveling at close to two hundred miles an hour, ended up traveling 
all the way into pit row.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s that?&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mamoru asked as he turned around, &quot;What&#39;s what? I...&quot;

SPLAT!

Mamoru was silenced as a chimpanzee turd traveling close to one hundred 
and fifty miles an hour slammed into his face. Up in the stands, Minako, 
Rei and Usagi looked on in horror as the now disoriented future king of 
Crystal Tokyo stumbled onto the track.

------

Meanwhile, in racecar number nine, Racer X was brooding as he talked to 
himself.

&quot;Haruka has passed me but I cannot let her get past Speed Racer since if 
she did that she would then win and I&#39;d finish third when I really need 
to win in order to reveal my true identity to Speed and Pops because 
Speed does not know that I Racer X am really Rex Racer Speed&#39;s older 
brother and ut-oh wait a second what&#39;s that?&quot;

CRASH!

Racer X raced on, leaving behind Mamoru&#39;s twitching body. Before the 
paramedics could arrive, fifteen more cars left their tire treads across 
his body as well.

&quot;Oh my God,&quot; Ami yelled, &quot;They killed Mamoru!&quot;

&quot;You bastards!&quot; Makoto added.

---Half an Hour Later---

The race was immediately cancelled due to Team Speed&#39;s poor 
sportsmanship and the tragic death of Chiba Mamoru. Since Haruka was in 
second place when Speed was disqualified, she was declared the winner. 
As the three Senshi up in the stands came down to join the others, over 
by the Mach Five Pops was going ballistic.

&quot;Spritle you and that retarded monkey of yours cost Speed the 
championship young man that&#39;s it I&#39;m sending your stupid ass to military 
school and I&#39;m going to take that stupid chimp to the vet on Monday to 
get him fixed AAAAARGH!&quot;

Michiru, who was listening in, tilted her head a bit. She then turned to 
her love.

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; she told Haruka, &quot;They do talk a lot without pausing to 
take a breath, don&#39;t they?&quot;

Meanwhile, as Usagi looked down on Mamoru&#39;s poop-stained corpse, Rei 
came over and put a consoling hand on her friend&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Usagi, I... I&#39;m so sorry, I...&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Usagi said softly, &quot;It&#39;s okay, really. You see, I was planning on 
breaking up with him anyways. I tried to love him Rei, I really did, for 
the future and all. But I just couldn&#39;t. I&#39;m already in love with 
someone else.&quot;

Rei&#39;s heart began to flutter, &quot;Really?&quot; she asked, trying not to get her 
hopes up, &quot;Who?&quot;

Usagi looked away from Mamoru&#39;s now cold body to meet the Fire Senshi&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;You.&quot; she said, &quot;I love you Rei, I have for a while now. I was 
going to end it with Mamo-chan and ask you to... God, I don&#39;t even know 
if you feel the same way about me, but I... sniff sniff... Geez, what 
did that friggin&#39; monkey eat? Anyways, I love you Rei, and... And if you 
gave me a chance, I...&quot;

Rei cut her off as she rushed forward to embrace the blond, their lips 
meeting as they clung to one another. Finally separating, they joined 
hands and walked off the track as the first aid station rushed over to 
help the sudden rash of nosebleeds in Team Speed&#39;s area of pit row 
caused by the sight of two girls getting romantic.
