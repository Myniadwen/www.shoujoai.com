---An Alternate Reality, the Present---

Minerva slowly knelt down, keeping an eye on the pale woman dressed all 
in black in front of her. Mistress Nine stood still, not moving, looking 
at the Senshi with unblinking eyes.

&quot;Hoshi.&quot; Minerva whispered as she slowly sat back on her calves, &quot;Do you 
trust me?&quot;

The child quickly nodded her head, &quot;Yes, Sailor Minerva-sama. You&#39;re one 
of the Sailor Senshi, one of the good guys.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; she said, keeping her voice low, &quot;I want you to listen very 
carefully. I want you to climb onto my back.&quot;

&quot;You mean like a piggyback ride?&quot; Hoshi asked. Minerva nodded her head 
ever so slightly.

&quot;Yes, like a piggyback ride. Wrap your arms tightly around my neck 
Hoshi, and close your eyes. No matter what, try not to let go.&quot;

The girl was scared. Scared of the skeletons and darkness surrounding 
her, scared of the woman standing there watching her and the Senshi, and 
scared most of all by the fact that Sailor Minerva sounded scared. She 
quickly did as she was told, though. Minerva reached behind her to help 
her onto her back, and once she had her arms wrapped tightly around the 
Senshi&#39;s neck she then wrapped her legs around her torso as well. 
Minerva then slowly got to her feet, her mind racing.

Setsuna, Usagi and Luna were her main sources of information on the 
topic of the Death Busters and Pharaoh Ninety, as well as on how close 
Hotaru had come to loosing her soul to the entity known as Mistress 
Nine. Michiru, Haruka and Hotaru herself avoided any discussion of that 
time period like the plague. It was a very sore subject among the 
Outers, especially among Haruka and Michiru who&#39;d fought so hard to kill 
their now beloved daughter.

Hotaru did talk about that time period once. She confided to Kihomi a 
few months ago that, while she didn&#39;t remember everything prior to her 
rebirth, she did recall the internal struggle against Mistress Ninety as 
being the hardest fought battle she&#39;d ever faced. She also admitted that 
she still had nightmares about when the demon was in control of her, 
forcing her to say and do things against her will. At the time Kihomi 
didn&#39;t fully understand; how could a Senshi powerful enough to destroy 
the world have nightmares? As powerful as her beloved mei was, how could 
she truly know fear.

Looking at Mistress Nine, and at the world around her, she now 
understood.

She also now realized what had happened to her. This wasn&#39;t the future, 
but another universe; a different reality in which Hotaru lost in the 
end to Mistress Nine and the Sailor Senshi failed to stop the silence. 
She looked at the figure still standing motionless before her, and felt 
a sudden wave of pity for Haruka&#39;s &quot;little Firefly&quot; who was now no more.

&quot;You poor, poor child.&quot; she said sadly, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry you lost against 
her.&quot;

The woman&#39;s black lips curled downward into a frown as she started to 
walk forward, &quot;Poor, poor child?&quot; she asked sarcastically, &quot;She is not 
to be pitied. She is blessed. All are blessed, all the sad little ants. 
Blessed are the murderers; they left me less to destroy. Blessed are the 
pedophiles and rapists; they had their fun before the end. Blessed are 
the robbers, the thieves, the con artists; they expired with the most 
toys. All are blessed now with the Beatific Blindness of my Immaculate 
Silence. That &#39;poor, poor child&#39; has been transfigured, released from 
her cocoon and born again as the incarnation of darkness you see before 
you. Weep not for the worthless, weak worm who surrendered her body to 
me. Weep for yourselves; still blind to your transgressions, still 
living the lie of light.&quot;

Hoshi didn&#39;t understand most of what was being said. She knew though 
that the scary lady was a bad person, and that both she and Sailor 
Minerva were in great danger. She wanted her parents right now; she 
wanted them to make the bad lady go away. She didn&#39;t like it here; she 
wanted to go home.

Minerva felt the girl on her back tighten her grip, and thought she felt 
a tear land on the nape of her neck. As Mistress Nine continued to come 
forward, her eyes started to glow blood red.

&quot;Hoshi, hold tight.&quot; Minerva whispered, &quot;War Arrows!&quot; she shouted, 
sending the energy ball of plasma arrows directly at the demon&#39;s face. 
&quot;Great Shield!&quot; she then called, leaping as far back as she could while 
holding the bronze colored shield in front of her with her left arm, her 
right hand reaching behind her back to hold Hoshi in place. She landed 
next to a skeleton wearing Sailor Venus&#39; fuku, and lowered her arm to 
peer over the shield at her enemy.

Mistress Nine stood there as before, not moving. The yellow energy ball 
hung in the air harmlessly in front of her as she examined it curiously. 
She reached her arm inside the ball and pulled one of the many 
electric-blue arrows out, electrical sparks encircling the projectile. 
After studying it for a few moments, she took the arrow and jabbed it 
through the palm of her left hand, wincing as dark scarlet blood began 
to trickle down her wrist and forearm while some dripped to the ground. 
She then took the arrow in her left hand and stabbed her right palm, 
again gritting her teeth as blood flowed out and fell to the scorched 
earth below.

&quot;I am death.&quot; she said as she put the arrow back into the ball with its 
siblings, &quot;I am the apocalypse and the omega. And now, for your 
penance...&quot; Stretching her arms out, she started to laugh as the attack 
now came back full force at Sailor Minerva and Hoshi. Minerva stretched 
out her force field, but was still knocked backwards by the force of the 
attack. In midair she twisted her body to make sure the girl on her back 
wouldn&#39;t be hurt.

She crashed through the remains of a clothing store, her shield 
absorbing the impact. Turning back to her enemy, she saw Mistress Nine 
continue to laugh maniacally as the ground at her feet started to move, 
bubbling up and rising where her blood had spilt. Suddenly, long oily 
black tentacles sprang up all around the Messiah of Darkness, making 
slurping and squishing sounds as they rose from the ground, a 
mucous-like slime glistening on their smooth surfaces. They then all 
reached out, as with one mind, towards Minerva and Hoshi.

---Crystal Tokyo, 3043---

She came out here onto the balcony of the palace and looked out over the 
city. She covered her mouth as she continued to sob, her eyes now 
stinging from all the tears she&#39;d already shed. A set of footsteps 
coming up from behind alerted her she had company.

&quot;Venus, love.&quot; A gentle voice said as the Princess of Love felt her 
wife&#39;s hands wrap around her from behind. She turned to see her 
raven-haired partner looking at her understandingly, &quot;It&#39;s okay. We&#39;re 
all hurting for them.&quot;

Lady Venus allowed Mars to pull her close. She couldn&#39;t stand it 
anymore; the pain of seeing two people who loved each other so much 
being taken away from one another so cruelly. And, around the world, 
hundreds of other lives were being taken away, hundreds of other loves 
lost.

&quot;I... I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; she sobbed, &quot;I know I should be stronger, I should 
be there for them, but it hurts. It hurts too much and I...&quot;

&quot;Shhh...&quot; Mars whispered, &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; As she held her wife in her 
arms, her mind wandered back to a time before they met, when she first 
learned she was a Senshi. Back then, for a very brief period, she 
actually had a crush on Tuxedo Kamen of all people. Later, she developed 
feelings for Usagi. Of course, the fact that Usagi was straight quickly 
squashed any hopes of a romance.

It was when her grandfather died, if she recalled correctly. She was 
feeling depressed, and while she usually never drank she&#39;d hit the 
bottle hard that day. Mina-chan came over to the bar she was at purely 
by accident. She saw her and brought her back to the Shrine. Minako 
helped her nurse her hangover, and stayed with her all the next day as 
she wept and talked about her grandfather. It was then that she began to 
have feelings for the blond. She later learned Mina-chan shared those 
feelings. Looking back, she should have realized it that day at the 
Shrine; Minako had held her hair back while she puked into a toilet 
during her hangover. If that wasn&#39;t love, Mars didn&#39;t know what was.

Back in the present, she looked at her sorrowful mate and tilted her 
chin up with her finger, &quot;Venus, if... if that were me instead of Lady 
Minerva drifting off into nonexistence, would you still leave?&quot;

The blond looked at her wife with a hurt expression, &quot;How can you even 
ask that?&quot; she asked, &quot;Of course not. I&#39;d stay with you &#39;till the end.&quot;

&quot;And if you were with me, watching me disappear, unable to help, would 
you want to be alone or have your friends with you for support?&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;d...&quot; she stopped herself when she realized what her wife was 
getting at. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; she whispered, &quot;I&#39;ve been so...&quot;

&quot;So very human.&quot; Mars said, kissing Venus&#39; forehead as she wiped away 
her love&#39;s tears, &quot;Come.&quot; she said, leading her love back to the vigil 
taking place around Ladies Minerva and Pluto.

---Tokyo, the Present---

Sailor Neptune was helping Saturn to her feet as Sailors Mars and 
Jupiter came over to Uranus and Sailor Moon.

&quot;That blond.&quot; Sailor Jupiter began, &quot;I take it that was the woman 
claiming to be Usagi&#39;s older sister?&quot;

Sailor Moon nodded her head, &quot;Yes. She&#39;s on our side.&quot;

Mars&#39; eyes narrowed, &quot;That remains to be seen.&quot; she quipped, motioning 
with her head over to Saturn and Mercury, &quot;Still, I sensed no evil in 
her...&quot;

Uranus was about to say something, when a man and woman ran over to 
them. Both were distraught, and the woman was crying uncontrollably.

&quot;Our... Our daughter...&quot; the father began, &quot;Please, we know you&#39;re good 
people, and our daughter, she... she&#39;s gone. That evil woman...&quot;

Sailor Mars looked down uncomfortably as both Sailors Moon and Jupiter 
looked sadly at the couple. Sailor Uranus walked over to them. She 
rarely showed her more vulnerable side, especially in public. But 
something about the look of grief on their faces, and the tears of the 
mother, touched her deeply.

That, and the thought of what once almost happened to Hotaru at the 
hands of Babylon.

&quot;Don&#39;t cry.&quot; she said to the mother. Her usually low, husky voice 
sounded just the tiniest bit softer, &quot;We&#39;ll get the woman who did this, 
and we&#39;ll save your daughter. As a parent myself, I give you my word.&quot;

The woman looked up at the tall Senshi with the sandy blond hair and 
smiled ever so slightly as hope shown in her eyes, &quot;Thank you.&quot; she 
choked out, &quot;I...&quot; her husband pulled her close as she started to weep 
again. Uranus turned away, deliberately avoiding the other&#39;s eyes as she 
went to check up on Saturn.

------

&quot;Hey, quit shoving!&quot;

&quot;Stupid bitch!&quot;

&quot;Look where you&#39;re going!&quot;

Saeko was gasping for air, and her legs were burning as she ran toward 
the entrance of the subway depot, pushing and shoving aside anyone that 
got in her way. It was rush hour, and the sidewalks were packed with 
commuters. She looked quickly behind her and saw the Senshi in disguise 
chasing after her through the busy streets of Tokyo. She was a block 
away and closing. As she was looking back she bumped clumsily into a 
middle aged businesswoman.

&quot;Oof! Hey, watch it!&quot; the woman scolded. As Saeko tried to move forward 
the woman grabbed her arm, &quot;I&#39;m not done with you yet young lady. I...&quot; 
she was cut off as Saeko punched her as hard as she could in the nose. 
As the woman clutched her face and sunk to her knees, Saeko quickly 
forced her way past the rest of the crowd and ran into the subway 
entrance, avoiding the hands of angry witnesses wishing to come to the 
businesswoman&#39;s aid.

--

Sailor Mercury was running as fast as she could after the creep who 
knocked her two friends and fellow Senshi down. Sailor Venus was right 
behind her.

&quot;Mercury!&quot; Venus yelled, &quot;What...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s that blond!&quot; the shorter Senshi yelled back, &quot;She hurt Saturn and 
Pluto!&quot; As she ran, Mercury found herself silently cursing the commuters 
in the way between her and &quot;Usagi&#39;s sister.&quot; The woman was obviously in 
league with that nutcase with the metal ball who zapped Kihomi. She 
could see the blond in front of her, closing in on her accomplice. There 
were too many people in the way for her to use any of her attacks on the 
two, but the moment she was free to she vowed to make them both pay.

Sailor Venus meanwhile was becoming separated from Mercury by an old man 
who&#39;d inadvertently found himself in her way as he exited an antique 
store. As she pushed him aside, her mind flashed back to the grocery 
store parking lot where the blond appeared out of nowhere, shooting off 
electric bolts and...

Electric bolts!

&quot;Mercury!&quot; Venus yelled, hoping that she&#39;d be heard over the crowd. 
&quot;Mercury, wait! I think she&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;I know; she&#39;s getting away!&quot; Mercury yelled back, just as another old 
person got in Venus&#39; way and slowed her down again.

--

Lady Jupiter saw Saeko disappear into the subway entrance.

&quot;Don&#39;t push me.&quot;

&quot;My nose! Did you see what that woman did to...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re running down the wrong side of the sidewalk you stupid...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; she shouted angrily as she sent a painful electric charge 
out for five feet in all directions. Suddenly the people in front of her 
moved out of the way like the parting of the red sea. She ran into the 
station and saw her prey waiting in line for a subway train that was 
coming to a stop.

&quot;Desperate times.&quot; she whispered. &quot;Jupiter Current Absorption!&quot; she 
shouted. The train came to a stop just as every light, walkman, cell 
phone, and all other electrical devices went out. In the darkness the 
men and women of the cramped Tokyo subway griped because of the 
automatic doors failing to open to let them out. In the terminal a woman 
looked back and screamed as she saw a blond who was glowing like a 
flashlight in the darkness run down the steps to the platform, zapping 
anyone in her way to make them move.

&quot;A ghost!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a youma!&quot;

Lady Jupiter began to feel her head pound as people ran in terror away 
from her. As she reached the platform, a second set of footsteps started 
coming down the steps.

&quot;Stop now, both of you!&quot; Sailor Mercury cried angrily, &quot;Don&#39;t either of 
you move!&quot;

Saeko quickly aimed the orb at the young woman and pushed the button to 
fire. Nothing happened. She then turned to the glowing woman staring 
angrily at her.

&quot;It&#39;s you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she hissed, &quot;You&#39;re absorbing all the electricity 
in the area, including my dimensional ball.&quot;

&quot;Mercury,&quot; the blond called out to the Senshi standing at the bottom of 
the stairs, &quot;Listen to me, I...&quot;

&quot;You hurt Pluto and Saturn!&quot; Mercury said angrily, &quot;I cannot forgive you 
for that!&quot;

A second set of footsteps signaled the arrival of Sailor Venus. Saeko 
quickly reached into her coat pocket.

&quot;Look at you!&quot; she sneered at the blond, &quot;You&#39;re straining yourself so 
much to keep me from getting on the subway you can&#39;t even move anymore, 
or your concentration will falter. And your own true love over there is 
ready to do us both in.&quot; she said as she started to giggle.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; the blond growled angrily. Sailor Mercury was wondering what 
the dark-haired woman was talking about when Venus finally reached her, 
breathing hard as she tried to catch her breath.

&quot;M... Mercury, wait.&quot; she gasped, &quot;The... the blond... I think she&#39;s...&quot;

Before she could complete her sentence, Saeko pulled out the last of the 
flash grenades. A quick bolt of electricity knocked it from her hand 
however, and it fell to the ground harmlessly. The scientist looked back 
over to the blond.

&quot;Damn you, Jupiter!&quot; she screeched, &quot;Damn you!&quot;

The strain of absorbing all the electricity into herself and keeping her 
disguise up was proving too much for her. Jupiter gritted her teeth as 
her face turned red from the strain. As the blood vessels in her eyes 
suddenly burst from the tension she allowed the disguise to fade, 
falling to one knee as she clenched her fists and blood started slowly 
running down her cheeks from her eyes.

As both Sailors Venus and Mercury gasped, Saeko started to laugh.

&quot;Ha! So much for protecting the future!&quot; she shouted triumphantly. 
Looking more serious, she aimed the orb now at the Senshi from the 
future, &quot;You can&#39;t absorb the localized electrical field forever Lady 
Jupiter; the strain is already showing in your face! Once you can no 
longer hold it, I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Venus Love-Me Chain!&quot; the Senshi of Love cried. The scientist found 
herself wrapped up in a chain of hearts, quickly falling to the ground 
as she lost her balance. As Sailor Mercury rushed forward, Lady Jupiter 
let out a cry of agony as she fell forward onto her hands and the glow 
from her body ceased. Suddenly all the electricity in the subway 
terminal came back on.

Not surprisingly, no one ventured to get off the subway when the doors 
opened. They closed again, and the subway sped to its next stop.

&quot;M... Mako-chan?&quot; Sailor Mercury asked as she looked at the metallic 
green arm showing underneath the woman&#39;s white glove, &quot;Is that really 
you?&quot;

&quot;Stop!&quot; an extremely irate voice shouted as Sailor Pluto came rushing 
down the steps. &quot;Anyone moves and I&#39;ll...&quot; her voice trailed off as she 
saw the scientist restrained and the three Senshi. She did a double take 
when she saw Lady Jupiter.

&quot;You?&quot; she asked as the Senshi of Lightning slowly got to her feet. 
Taking a deep breath to calm herself, she addressed the Senshi from the 
future, &quot;I... I sent you back, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

Lady Jupiter slowly nodded her head as she wearily walked over and 
picked up the orb and brought it over to Mercury. Wiping the blood from 
her cheeks, her eyes now red and stinging, she placed the object in the 
young med student&#39;s hands. She then went over to Saeko and picked her up 
by her collar.

&quot;Where is she?&quot; Lady Jupiter demanded, &quot;What have you done to Lady 
Minerva?&quot;

&quot;I told you; I liberated...&quot;

&quot;You keep saying that.&quot; she said angrily, cutting the scientist off, 
&quot;How, damn it? How have you liberated her?&quot;

&quot;By sending her to meet the Mistress.&quot; Saeko answered. Sailor Pluto now 
came over, her eyes narrowing dangerously as she looked over Lady 
Jupiter&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;What Mistress?&quot; she asked angrily, &quot;Who have you sent her to meet?&quot;

Saeko looked straight into Pluto&#39;s violet eyes as she smiled joyfully, 
&quot;Mistress Nine, of course.&quot;</pre>
