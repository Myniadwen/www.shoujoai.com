~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&#147;She&#146;s resting peacefully sir, it&#146;s a good thing you got her here so 
soon, or she would have surely died&#148; the young resident doctor smiled, 
placing a hand on Haruka&#146;s arm before batting her eyelashes at the 
blond. Haruka silently groaned.

&#147;Thank you. May I see her now?&#148; Haruka asked, giving the woman a 
charming smile as the woman seemed to melt at her feet, nodding 
excitedly while babbling about a special favor for such a handsome 
guy. Ignoring her, Haruka strode forward, walking slowly into the 
darkened hospital room. A sharp breath escaped her lips as she saw the 
dark blood soaked patch at the base of her neck, almost hidden by her 
beautiful aquamarine hair.

&#147;The cut was luckily not as long as we first thought. Just a scratch 
really, but a deep one. It should heal over in a few days. Could you 
tell me anything about her? I mean&#133;is she your&#133;sister, or what?&#148; the 
young doctor asked, still latched onto Haruka&#146;s arm.

&#147;No, she&#146;s definitely not my sister&#148; the blond stated coldly, 
shrugging the woman off before sitting down next to the hospital bed, 
just as the young beauty let out a small moan of pain.

&#147;W-where am I?&#148; the smaller woman asked, opening fearful eyes to look 
at Haruka, &#147;and who the hell are you?!&#148;

&#147;I think I&#146;m the one who saved you!&#148; Haruka shot back, feeling 
offended by the deep mistrust in the woman&#146;s eyes.

&#145;What did you expect stupid? For her to throw herself into your arms? 
She&#146;s probably not even a lesbian!&#146; Ruka thought darkly, rubbing her 
aching temples.

&#147;What do you mean&#133;saved me? I-I can&#146;t&#133;remember&#133;how did I get here?&#148; 
the other woman asked, pulling Michiru from her thoughts.

&#147;You were almost raped last night. I found you in an ally with your 
clothes torn apart and that cut on your neck.&#148; The blond pointed, 
anger flaring once more as the aqua haired woman slapped her hand 
away, &#147;what were you doing out so late? You don&#146;t look more then 15&#148;

&#147;16. I&#146;m 16. And everything else isn&#146;t any of your business&#148;

&#147;Got a name to go with that, miss 16?&#148; Haruka asked, leaning back from 
the bed.

&#147;Um&#133;Michelle. Michelle Ka..tri&#148; Michiru covered swiftly, noticing the 
man&#146;s features darken slightly, &#147;and who are you Mr&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Miss Ten&#146;oh Haruka&#148; the blond smiled, &#147;I&#146;m the youngest photographer 
to enter the business. I own Ten&#146;oh inc.&#148;

Michiru nodded slightly, relaxing as she realized slowly whom she was 
with. She&#146;d been a great fan of Mr&#133;Miss Ten&#146;ohs work since she&#146;d come 
out two years before, &#147;that means you&#146;re only&#133;what, 19?&#148;

&#147;20&#148;

(AN: sorry about the age difference. ^_^)

&#147;Haruka!&#148; a rough voice called from the door, causing Michiru to 
flinch as Haruka&#146;s partner walked into the room, eyeing Michiru with 
unease, &#147;so this is where you&#146;ve been. I&#146;ve been trying to get ahold 
of you. Mrs.Chiba wishes you to join her for dinner tonight&#148;

Haruka smiled, remembering the bubbly blond from her early teenage 
years. When she&#146;d been an outsider, and nobody wanted anything to do 
with her, Usagi had been the first to befriend her.

&#147;She&#146;s just gotten back from her honeymoon, right?&#148; the blond asked, 
not noticing as a cold wall was put up between she and Michiru.

The dark haired man nodded, flicking his eyes to the girl in the bed 
before looking meaningfully at Haruka.

&#147;Oh, Michelle, this is Derek Windwood. He&#146;s my assistant at the 
firm&#133;Michelle?&#148;

&#147;Please leave&#133;now&#133;&#148; Michiru whispered, huddling into a small ball. Her 
anger flared as no one made a move to leave, &#147;GET OUT!&#148;

&#147;Michelle-&#148;

&#147;Leave her alone Haruka, we need to go tux shopping&#148; Derek suddenly 
grabbed hold of her arm, casting one dark look at the shocked Michiru 
before dragging Haruka out of the room.

&#145;Why did I do that?&#146; Michiru suddenly wondered, chills racking her 
body, &#145;Miss Ten&#146;oh was being perfectly civil to me&#133;it feels so empty 
without her here with me&#133;&#146;

The aqua haired girl let out a small sob, turning her face to the 
pillows as the floodgate of tears broke&#133;

&#147;You found her how?!&#148; a young blond shrieked, causing some of the 
other customers to glance at them.

&#147;I know. She seemed so calm when she woke up. It wasn&#146;t until Derek 
came in that she started rejecting me. I must admit it hurts more then 
I&#146;d like it to.&#148; Haruka laughed self mockingly. Usagi nodded, her 
sweet face pinched with concern.

&#147;Maybe&#133;you care for her? I mean, it&#146;s been a very long time since 
you&#146;ve last had a girlfriend. You and Rei broke up almost a year ago.&#148; 
The younger blond whispered, still thinking it was a touchy subject, 
besides the point that Rei and Haruka were still close friends.

&#147;Hmmm&#133;you do have a point Odango.&#148; Haruka smiled, earning a glare from 
her companion. Usagi had gotten her hair cut to waist length before 
her wedding to Mamoru. The two were doing well, Usagi working for 
Haruka while attending Tokyo U, and Mamoru still doing residency.

&#147;If it were anyone but you, I&#146;d hit them Ruka&#148; Usagi smiled before 
giving Haruka a serious look, &#147;do you want to call Mamo-Chan and see 
if he&#146;d take over the resident job of Michiru Kaioh?&#148;

&#147;Who?&#148; Haruka cut in, looking confused.

&#147;Michiru Kaioh, the girl you checked in.&#148; Usagi murmured, wincing at 
the flash of hurt that went thought her friends eyes, &#147;you didn&#146;t 
know&#133;oh Ruka, I&#146;m sorry&#148;

&#147;No&#133;it&#146;s okay. She had a shock, it&#146;s easy to see why she&#146;d lie to me&#133;&#148; 
the older woman intoned, grasping her friends hand reassuringly.

&#147;Well, how about it? I&#146;m sure Mamo-Chan could put in the good word for 
you&#133;&#148; Usagi winked, going back to her food. Haruka grinned charmingly, 
winking back.

&#147;I think I&#146;ll put the good word in myself. In fact, I think I&#146;ve found 
my new beach girl&#148; Haruka smiled, a dreamy look coming to her eyes as 
she imagined her beautiful angel in the summer suits. And the amount 
of time they&#146;d be spending together.

&#147;That&#146;s a great idea! I can&#146;t wait to start working on it with you. 
Think, all day spent on beautiful beaches taking pictures all day. All 
those board walk shops and all the fairs!&#148; the bubbly blond babbled on 
(AN: tongue twister. @_@), letting Haruka drift into her own little 
world for awhile before a husky voice laughed from just behind her, 
causing her to jump.

&#147;Sorry Ten&#146;oh-San, didn&#146;t mean to scare you.&#148; Mamoru Chiba smiled, 
sliding into the booth next to his wife, taking a moment to kiss her 
softly before turning back to Ruka.

&#147;Haruka. We&#146;ve been over this Doc. How ya feeling about loosing your 
charming wife for a couple weeks while we go gallivanting?&#148; Haruka 
asked, laughing at the faked angst expression on his face.

&#147;I&#146;m okay with it, you know I trust you. Just bring her home safely, 
and she&#146;s not being photographed. I don&#146;t want all of Japan gawking at 
my Usako.&#148; The ebony haired man laughed, his blue eyes dancing.

&#147;No problem. But I need my assistant. I don&#39;t know how I got on 
without her for three whole weeks. If it weren&#146;t for Derek Windwood, 
I&#146;d have drowned&#133;&#148; Haruka stopped mid-sentence as she noticed the 
slight shadow that passed through Usagi&#146;s eyes, &#147;What is it?&#148;

&#147;Windwood-San&#133;he seems so&#133;offish to me. He&#146;s not coming with us is 
he?&#148; Usagi asked, twirling a long strand of light gold hair around her 
finger.

&#147;Sorry, but I&#146;m afraid he is. We&#146;re short handed with the amount of 
June Weddings we&#146;ve got booked. You and Derek are the only ones who 
are free for two weeks.&#148; Haruka murmured, disturbed by the solemn 
attitude of the normally bubbly girl.

&#147;Okay. Don&#39;t&#146; worry, I&#146;ll just avoid him. After all, I&#146;m more 
important then him!&#148; Usagi giggled, changing to a gasp as she glanced 
at the gold watch Haruka had given her, &#147;Oh god! We&#146;re late for 
meeting up with Rei and the others! Sorry to cut this short, but we 
gotta go! You have to go talk to Michiru anyway! Bye Ruka!!&#148;

&#147;The whirlwind strikes again&#148; Haruka murmured before dropping enough 
money to pay for the meal as well as a large tip for the waiter. 
Picking up her Jacket, she slung it around her shoulders before 
walking out the door, sliding into her car as the Valet got out and 
collected his tip.

&#145;well Michiru&#133;lets see what you&#146;ll think of this&#133;&#146; the blond thought, 
smiling again and she sped off towards the hospital&#133;



Michiru sat in her bed, quietly reading through the music magazine 
from her bag, gazing down at the graceful looking violins as she heard 
the heavy door creak open.

&#147;I&#146;m not very hungry now miss&#133;&#148; the next word lodged itself in 
Michiru&#146;s throat as she glanced up, not to see the friendly nurse, but 
someone in a dark hooded coat coming towards her, holding up one of 
the deadly sharp surgery knives.

&#147;time to finish the job&#133;&#148; he grated roughly, raising the blade above 
his head&#133;
