<p>“Erika asked me out yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Saw that coming.”</p>
<p>“I . . . said yes.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Um . . . cool. Have fun.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t see that coming?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you liked her. She’s really pretty though, so good job.”</p>
<p>“Well I don’t . . . I mean, I’m just trying to see if I do like her.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. Sometimes that what dates are for.”</p>
<p>“Date . . . I guess so.”</p>
<p>“. . . Where are you guys going?”</p>
<p>“She invited me to an archery competition.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Do you like them?”</p>
<p>“Never been to one.”</p>
<p>“In a few weeks, you’ll be in one yourself.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, that’s true. Are you gonna come watch?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Maybe.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to . . .”</p>
<p>“Why did you tell me this?”</p>
<p>“That Erika asked me out?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Would you rather I hadn’t?”</p>
<p>“No, but I want to know why you decided to tell me.”</p>
<p>“Because  . . . I dunno, because it seemed like the right thing to do. I thought  about not telling you but that seemed so dishonest. It’s this Saturday  too, but it won’t interfere with dinner.”</p>
<p>“If . . . If you want to reschedule-”</p>
<p>“No. Minako. I said it’s not going to interfere. I’ll make sure.”</p>
<p>“If that’s what you want.”</p>
<p>“<em>It is</em>. Look, Minako . . . look at me . . . should I not have told you?”</p>
<p>“No,  it’s fine. You should . . . Just . . . just remember to bring mace. I  mean, Erika’s got devious sexual predator written all over her.”</p>
<p>“. . . Of course, hah – five-foot-nothing and shy just screams danger.”</p>
<p>“You better believe it . . .”</p>
<hr />
<p>Saturday  morning, Rei drove to the archery competition. Nervousness was  suspiciously absent, though her conscience was troubled. Determinedly,  she ignored the vaguely contrite, listless feeling.</p>
<p>They met at  the entrance to the event – Erika was waiting there when Rei arrived,  their tickets in hand. They chatted a bit about classes and the  universities they had applied to before finding an open space in the  bleachers set up for the competition and settling down to watch.</p>
<p>The  archers were wandering about in the traditional gi and hakama,  organising and composing themselves. Rei felt a pang of envy that they  got to compete while she had to sit and observe instead of actually  participating. Joining the archery club made Rei realise how much she  enjoyed the sport, where before it had only been a hobby she practised  now and then when it occurred to her.</p>
<p>Erika cooed at a cute  little kid sitting in front of them, returning Rei’s wandering  attention to the girl beside her. Their eyes met and Erika smiled.  Shifting in her seat, Rei looked back at the archers and from the  corner of her eye she saw the other girl’s expression fall. Realising  she was probably supposed to have smiled back, Rei frowned, mentally  noting that Minako would have probably just teased her for being  socially inept. Should she say something? She had nothing to say. What  the hell were you supposed to do on a date anyway?</p>
<p>She and Minako  had never gone on many dates and their first had been a rather  unexciting trip to a movie theatre. Watching the movie hadn’t been that  stimulating but for the entirety of the film, Rei’s attention had  mostly been fixed on the blonde girl to her right anyway – where she  was looking, her reactions to what was happening on screen, where on  the armrest her hand was laying. She had nearly jumped a foot when  Minako’s hand had inadvertently landed on top of her own and it had  been purely instinctive to curl her fingers upward to keep that warm,  soft skin pressed against her own. She usually had no interest in such  things but she wouldn’t mind seeing another movie with Minako.</p>
<p>Erika  was looking at her curiously and Rei realised she was smiling to  herself. To avoid having to lie in order to explain herself, she turned  back to the kyudo range with renewed focus. Erika hesitantly looked  back to the range where the archers seemed to be lining up to start the  event.</p>
<p><em>See!?</em> some persistent part of her brain was chirping. <em>You go on a date with another girl and all you can think of is her</em>!  Rei nearly sighed at her own thoughts for aggravating the feelings of  guilt and dishonesty stirring about uncomfortably in her chest.</p>
<p>An  hour and a half later, Rei felt she had been sufficiently punished for  leading Erika on. The first couple of archers had been interesting, the  next few less so, and by now Rei didn’t even care if the competitors  hit the target or not, let alone if they had perfected the minute  details of their form.</p>
<p><em>Maybe next we could watch paint dry</em>,  she thought sarcastically to herself and then felt bad even though she  hadn’t voiced the thought. She peeked over at Erika and realised the  other girl looked just as bored as she felt.</p>
<p>The spectators were  all silent as they watched the current archer take his shot and Rei  waited until he had released his arrow and stepped back before she  nudged the shorter girl in the shoulder and nodded toward a concession  stand. She quietly asked Erika if she wanted to go and see what was  being sold.</p>
<p>At Erika’s nod, they crept out of the stands,  apologising to the people they had to step over. Stretching her arms,  grateful to be moving around again, Rei led them over to the small  shack selling snacks where they poked around for a bit. Erika didn’t  find anything she wanted and Rei wasn’t hungry, but neither of them  wanted to go back to watching the mind-numbing competition.</p>
<p>Dark,  doe eyes looked up at her hopefully as Erika suggested they find a café  instead and Rei looked away as all of the afternoon’s repressed guilt  came roaring to the surface.</p>
<p><em>Time to be honest now</em>, the voice of her conscience spoke up again. <em>Think of it as practice for later</em>, it added smugly.</p>
<p>Choosing  her words carefully, Rei began, “That sounds nice, Erika, it does, but  I think you should take someone else out for coffee. Someone who . . .  who isn’t already in love.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The doorbell rang at exactly  five-to-six and Minako dashed for the front door, paused, counted to  three and reached for the doorknob. “Welcome,” she intoned with mock  solemnity. She opened the door for Rei to enter and swept her eyes over  the other girl as she stepped past.</p>
<p>The sweater Rei was wearing  was stylish but fairly domestic looking, as were the neutrally beige  pants she wore, though they fit quite closely along the length of her  slender legs. Minako had expected her to wear something conservative –  it was dinner with the parents after all – but she hadn’t taken the  time to properly consider how good Rei would look in it. Foolish, she  figured, considering Rei could probably make a big green garbage bag  look sexy.</p>
<p>At the moment, however, she wasn’t channelling sexy so much as nervous.</p>
<p>“Relax,”  Minako said semi-chidingly, stilling Rei’s hands where they fidgeted in  front of her. She had never seen Rei seem so outwardly nervous and the  fact that it was caused by meeting her father was highly entertaining.  However, the way Rei was anxiously chewing her bottom lip was starting  to get distracting and Minako really didn’t need any further incentive  to stare at the miko. “My dad loves you already, so don’t worry about  meeting him.”</p>
<p>“He does?” Puzzlement took the place of anxiety and Rei was able to partially reassume her standard air of unruffled detachment.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Minako replied lightly. “Now come meet him.”</p>
<p>Her  dad was in the kitchen, hovering over his busy wife in a scene that was  all too familiar to Minako. The man loved to help but, like his  daughter, he was a disaster waiting to happen when it came to the  culinary arts. He may have been revered for his competency at the  hospital but he was very nearly banned from the kitchen at home.</p>
<p>“Yosh,”  Akemi Aino snapped and the man jumped back a bit, regarding his  agitated spouse amusedly, “if you don’t sit down or something I swear  I’ll-”</p>
<p>“Dad!” Minako interrupted, drawing the attention of her  parents. No need to subject their guest to happily wedded bickering.  “Meet Hino Rei.”</p>
<p>The blonde watched as Rei’s eyes widened in recognition and her dad’s narrowed in concentration. “Hino, was it?”</p>
<p>“Yes,”  Rei replied, clearly surprised and bemused. “You were Grandpa’s . . . I  don’t think we were ever introduced,” she said falteringly.</p>
<p>Minako  watched, slightly puzzled herself, as her father gave a little bow from  the neck. “I’m Yosh Aino – call me Yosh. How is your grandfather now?”</p>
<p>“Better. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Akemi clapped her hands together. “So you already know each other? How serendipitous!”</p>
<p>“Weird,”  Minako opined. Rei nodded. “Was this a couple months ago?” Again, Rei  nodded and Minako opened her mouth only to close it. Really, it had all  been nicely summed up by weird, leaving little else to say.</p>
<p>“Would you like something to drink, Rei?” Yosh asked in the lull that ensued. “We have tea if you’d like some.”</p>
<p>“Yes, tea please,” Rei replied politely. Minako’s father pivoted to get Rei her drink and Akemi returned to the busy stovetop.</p>
<p>The  miko nearly jumped when something brushed her arm before realising it  was only Minako reaching over to clasp her shoulder reassuringly. She  looked over to receive a bright grin and a thumbs-up. Rei rolled her  eyes, though her fidgeting had stopped and her lips quirked reflexively  into a smile.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the second Friday since making their deal to  spend them together, Rei and Minako agreed on seeing a movie. The  previous Friday’s psychic expo had been as lame as Rei had predicted  but they had decided to stay and look around at the corny booths and  stands. The miko had spent most of their time wandering around together  trying to be discrete as she yawned, worn out from studying late and  waking up early to do chores.</p>
<p>This Friday, Rei was plainly tired  once more, and Minako was easily convinced that an action flick might  have the greatest chance at keeping her awake. They got a bag of  gummies to share, Rei cracking a yawn while they waited in line at the  concession stand, and then found their theatre. Sometimes her eyes  watered after she yawned and she looked rather adorably dazed and  sleepy.</p>
<p>With a wry grin to herself, Minako wagered that the dark,  warm atmosphere of the theatre would knock Rei out like a light before  the trailers even gave way to the film. When the blonde looked over,  Rei’s eyelids were drifting closer together and her head was starting  to bob. Next glance and Rei had given up trying to keep her eyes on the  screen and had let sleep come as best it could with her head propped up  on her fist. Minako checked the screen – nope, not even done the  advertisements – and turned back to surreptitiously study the dozing  girl. Rei’s dark eyelashes rested against her pale cheeks, fluttering a  little with restlessness, and her hair spilled gracefully across the  armrest.</p>
<p>With a small smile, Minako pushed up the armrest between  them. Gently, she nudged the other girl and when Rei blinked and  straightened blearily, asking, “Did I miss something worth watching?”  Minako just shook her head and guided Rei’s head down to her lap.</p>
<p>With  a hum and not a sign of protest, the miko shifted into the more  comfortable sleeping position and within seconds of lying her head on  the blonde’s legs was still and breathing deeply.</p>
<p>Minako softly  brushed Rei’s dark hair, straightening the strands and grazing her  scalp lightly with the tips of her fingers. The movie began and she was  rather glad the acting was so bad and the plot so dull because this way  she didn’t have to divide her focus. Her attention was much more  absorbed by the idle task of toying with Rei’s hair than the lame movie.</p>
<p>Sifting  through the soft hairs at the back of Rei’s head, she lightly brushed  the smooth skin of her neck and pictured herself leaning down to touch  her lips tenderly to that warm, sensitive spot. Luckily, someone on  screen screamed and then things started exploding, so Minako distracted  herself with that for a few minutes while her reasoning returned and  berated her.</p>
<p>Rei stirred a few times through the course of the  film but seemed solidly conked out for most of it. Her leg was starting  to go numb but Minako couldn’t bring herself to mind it enough to shift  and risk waking the exhausted girl. There were pins and needles in her  foot when Rei finally lifted her head, staring blearily at the last few  minutes of the movie. Blood rushed back into her leg and Minako flexed  her leg, laughing when Rei asked, “What did I miss?”</p>
<p>“The movie,” she replied.</p>
<p>The  dark haired girl was embarrassed that she’d used Minako’s lap as a  headrest and apologetic that she missed the whole movie as they exited  the theatre but Minako just waved it off. “You can’t help that you’re  tired. Maybe Fridays aren’t a good day.”</p>
<p>“They’re fine!” Rei  insisted, her sudden intensity startling Minako slightly. “I’ll drink  coffee or something.” She made a face at the word <em>coffee</em>.</p>
<p>“Tea snob,” Minako prodded with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Sludge drinker,” Rei muttered back.</p>
<p>“Pinkie lifter.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Minako grinned. “You know-” she mimed sipping from a teacup, her pinkie raised and wiggling.</p>
<p>Rei rolled her eyes, huffed and made to reply, only to be cut off by a yawn.</p>
<hr />
<p>“So, you already know my dad,” Minako prompted, handing Rei plates to distribute while she set the glasses around the table.</p>
<p>“I guess. I mean, I only talked to him once and that was about Grandpa.”</p>
<p>“That’s  sort of strange,” Minako mused. “He mostly deals with kids. I guess  Grandpa might have been clinic hours for him or something . . .”</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged and they were silent for the next few seconds until the table  was set. Setting the table for four people was something new for Rei  and she took a moment to take in the comfortable warmth of the scene  before looking to Minako to see what they should do next.</p>
<p>The  blonde was watching her with uncertain blue eyes, though her smiling  lips and the light tone of her question tried to give lie to her  apprehension. “How was your date?”</p>
<p>Startled at the question and unprepared to answer it, Rei resorted to shrugging once more.</p>
<p>Minako  was silent and Rei could tell the blonde struggled with herself before  managing to let go. “Okay. Let’s go sit in the living room.”</p>
<p>“No,” Rei blurted, stopping Minako from heading into the adjacent room. “Well, I mean fine but . . .”</p>
<p>Rei  fidgeted. She wanted to reassure Minako in order to eliminate the  shadow of sullen doubt from the bubbly blonde’s expression, but she was  at a bit of a loss. It wasn’t in her nature to reach out or even to  speak more than necessary . . . but if it was for Minako . . . then it  was unacceptable not to try at the very least.</p>
<p>“It was  educational,” Rei began haltingly. “Awkward. Um, not bad I guess, but  not great. It was . . . Well, I think I don’t . . . I . . .” Rei  frowned, casting about for the words she needed.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Minako interjected softly. “You don’t have to explain.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Rei snapped, “but I’m trying, so shut up.”</p>
<p>The  blonde’s eyes widened at the temperamental outburst before she  chuckled, finding the miko’s irritability amusing as always. “Yes, Rei.”</p>
<p>With  a glower that held no real anger, Rei huffed and forced herself to be  as succinct as possible. “We’re not going out again. We’ve agreed to be  friends.”</p>
<p>Minako made as if to speak but closed her mouth with a carefully blank expression and only nodded.</p>
<p>“And . . .”</p>
<p>The  blonde waited once more for Rei to speak her mind and the renewed focus  directed at her from those blue eyes stirred an internal panic. Rei  hadn’t meant to say anything else. It had just slipped out.  Truth-telling was dangerous, it would appear, as it seemed to lead to  more truth being told. Dams blown on that infernal, unreliable  brain-mouth barrier, Rei switched back to their original topic.</p>
<p>“While  I’m explaining things, that morning I left your house I . . . got back  to the shrine and I had to call an ambulance. Grandpa was sick and he  fainted.” Rei could hear shame and anger in her voice and the emotions  threatened to choke her words completely. “He was doing my chores  because I wasn’t there to do them.”</p>
<p>Minako stayed where she was.  She didn’t approach to try and console her, which Rei appreciated. She  wasn’t looking for comfort, she just wanted things to back to being  clear and easy between them.</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault,” the blonde told her.</p>
<p>“I know,” Rei agreed in a subdued tone. “It just feels like it.”</p>
<p>Minako  smiled sadly but seemed to know better than to offer words of comfort  which Rei usually found empty and aggravating. Instead, she took Rei’s  hand and led them into the living room, her thumb stroking the back of  the miko’s hand in a sweet gesture that Rei could pretend to ignore.</p>
<p>“Come  on, I think the Brain Wall part of this TV show is on soon. It’s  ridiculous. You’ll hate it,” Minako informed her cheerfully, releasing  her hand to grab the remote.</p>
<p>They settled in front of the  television and Minako flipped through the channels, searching for  whatever strange game show she had on her mind. Rei was happy to face  the plasma screen and watch the blonde in her peripheral vision. The  show held no more interest for her than the archery competition had,  but for the first time all day, she felt at ease.</p>
<hr />
<p>“So he gets  his daughter back and basically destroys Paris because he’s a nutjob,  but oh well. Actually, I’m kinda surprised you didn’t wake up when  everything started exploding.”</p>
<p>Rei shrugged and then smirked at the blonde in the passenger seat. “I was comfy.”</p>
<p>“You were snoring.”</p>
<p>“I know I don’t snore. Nice try,” she scoffed.</p>
<p>Minako  pouted. “That’s no fun. You’re supposed to get all, ‘Oh no! Really?’”  she acted out in a falsetto, adopting an anxious expression. “And then  I would go, ‘Yeah, it was awful,’” in a deep voice, “and you would go,  ‘Good golly, I’m so embarrassed!’ and then I would go-”</p>
<p>“Minako.”</p>
<p>“There, there. You may saw logs when you sleep but you’ve got a very cute-”</p>
<p>“Minako!” Rei tried again, a little louder.</p>
<p>“Haha, um, face. Yes, face. And then you would go-”</p>
<p>“My god,” Rei muttered to herself, “she’s graduated from Annoying Academy.”</p>
<p>“Gee whiz! I sure am glad you told me! From now on, we should always-”</p>
<p>“With  honours in really strange impressions,” she added, not missing the  blonde’s giggle at her muttering. Changing tact, Rei flipped on the  radio and turned the volume up.</p>
<p>“‘sleep together so that you can tell-’ Oooo! I love this song!”</p>
<p>Predictably,  the song was some bouncy, vomitous pop concoction and Rei frowned at  Minako for messing up her preset stations. The hyperactive volleyballer  criticised her taste in music as ‘boring and geriatric’ and then had  the gall to enjoy this crap?</p>
<p>“Number one is supposed to be the  news station.” She pressed the second button and her scowl deepened.  “And this was classical! Now it’s- it- what <em>is</em> this?!”</p>
<p>Minako  laughed her joyous little cackle that indicated the fulfillment of some  plot to aggravate Rei. “Country western! You don’t like country?”</p>
<p>“<em>God no</em>. You do!?”</p>
<p>The laughing continued. “No, but I figured you’d hate it. Ah, worth it. Totally worth it.”</p>
<p>Then  the blonde switched back to the pop song from before and Rei just  sighed, aware that her lips were mutinously trying to form a grin.  Attempting to quell the uprising, she glanced over at Minako, now  blissfully singing along to the radio, and lost the battle.</p>
<p><em>What she does to me</em>,  Rei sighed to herself mentally, rather appalled at the mushy thoughts  that Minako’s smile, her laughter, her voice could conjure. Damn pop  songs and their absolutely asinine, unoriginal, horribly true lyrics.  Utterly intolerable. And worse, it was probably only a matter of time  before her restraint was worn through and these <em>feelings</em> started to manifest.</p>
<p>Well, there was a simple cure to that, though her heartbeat sounded in her ears and her palms grew sweaty at the thought of it.</p>
<hr />
<p>“So, Rei, what do your parents do?” Yosh asked.</p>
<p>Minako  froze at her dad’s question, kicking herself for not preparing Rei or  warning her parents in advance, but Rei answered easily enough.</p>
<p>“My father has been a senator for nearly the past fourteen years now.”</p>
<p>Yosh Aino made a noise of recognition. “Senator Hino’s grown quite popular.”</p>
<p>Neutrally,  Rei nodded with a murmur of agreement and at a glance, Minako could see  how tightly controlled the other girl’s calm expression was. Definitely  should have warned them away from this subject. Fortunately, her dad  seemed to detect Rei’s discomfort. Unfortunately, he chose to switch to  a worse topic of conversation.</p>
<p>“How about your mother? Stay at home? Love her job?”</p>
<p>Rei  hesitated at how best to deliver her answer, still unused to voicing it  even after all the years that had passed. Two sets of eyes were on her  attentively, the third silently sympathetic.</p>
<p>“Um no, she died when I was four. It was a long time ago,” she added, likely hoping to stave off awkward condolences.</p>
<p>“Oh,  I’m so sorry,” Minako’s mother, breathed sorrowfully. Her brows were  drawn up in sympathy and her blue eyes were beginning to look a little  wet.</p>
<p>“I remember you live with your grandfather – I should have put it together. I’m sorry for bringing it up,” Yosh apologised.</p>
<p>Rei shook her head. “It’s fine.”</p>
<p>He  nodded and stood with a secret wink at the young dinner guest. “Well,  looks like we’re done eating. I’ll take your plate.” He grabbed Rei’s  empty plate and stacked it on top of his own.</p>
<p>This snapped Akemi  out of her teary state in an instant. “Oh no you-” Yosh was already out  of the room, dishes in hand, before she could stop him. “Going to break  everything . . .” she muttered to herself and grabbed the remaining  plates before dashing off to prevent catastrophe from striking the  kitchen.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Minako sighed to Rei the moment they were alone. “I should have told them not to-”</p>
<p>Something shattered in the kitchen, likely glass by the sound of it, and Minako’s mother screeched, “<em>I told you not to touch anything</em>!”</p>
<p>They both froze for a moment before chuckling quietly.</p>
<p>“Should we be helping in there or something?” Rei asked.</p>
<p>Wryly, the blonde replied, “Not unless you want to give that woman a hernia. Besides, you’re a guest.”</p>
<p>“So what’s your excuse?” Rei lifted an eyebrow teasingly.</p>
<p>“Laziness.”  She grinned as Rei shot her a familiar, dry look but then abruptly  return to seriousness. “Still, I know you don’t like to talk about your  parents and I could have-”</p>
<p>“Stop it,” Rei interrupted sternly.  “It really is fine, Minako. I’m not going to break. Yeah, I don’t like  talking about them and I hate the way people look at me when they find  out about my mom but . . . it’s okay. I trust your family and it’s  natural that it come up in conversation so don’t feel bad about it.  You’ll get wrinkles.” She prodded the blonde’s forehead where it had  been creased by worry.</p>
<p>Minako snapped her teeth at the prodding  digit as it was retracted, regaining her playful attitude. “How dare  you? Perfection cannot be wrinkled. For this insult, you must stay for  a movie after desert.”</p>
<p>“Agreed!” Yosh chimed in as he re-entered the dining room, desert in hand.</p>
<p>With a grin, Rei capitulated. “As far as punishments go, this is very harsh, but I accept.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“And  then I got up to the cashier, realised where I’d had to put my money,  and then I had to pull it out of my bra in front of him and hand it to  him.”</p>
<p>With a distracted puff of laughter, Rei replied, “Good one.”</p>
<p>Expecting  more of an answer, or at least some teasing, Minako thought back on  most of the car ride since leaving the theatres and realised that for  the latter half, Rei had been unusually silent, even for her. The miko  wasn’t what anyone would call talkative at the best of times, but  Minako hadn’t had much of a problem drawing her into a conversation  since around the second month of math class.</p>
<p>“You okay?” she asked lightly.</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, yeah. Just thinking,” the dark haired girl reassured her.</p>
<p>The took the turn onto Minako’s street as she joked, “Ah, yes that can be difficult.”</p>
<p>She  expected some dry reply to the effect that – yes, Minako obviously  found thinking quite difficult, but the little jab never came. It was a  little disappointing. However, the miko didn’t look troubled and  nothing seemed amiss, so Minako let it go. Rei was tired after all and  if she would rather concentrate on driving, that was fine.</p>
<p>Rei’s Prelude pulled into its usual spot on the Aino’s wide driveway and its driver shifted it into park.</p>
<p>Grabbing her tote, Minako unbuckled herself and opened the door. “Bye, Rei.”</p>
<p>“. . . Bye.”</p>
<p>“See you Monday.”</p>
<p>She  got out of the car, closed the door, blew Rei a kiss and made her way  up the driveway to her front porch. Her hand was on the doorknob when  she heard the sound of a car door opening and closing. Minako turned to  look back but the car’s headlights cast everything behind them into  darkness.</p>
<p>“Rei?” she called uncertainly, squinting as she tried to peer into the shadows.</p>
<p>Footsteps,  and then the miko’s silhouette stepped in front of the lights and paced  towards her with purpose, her hair flaring behind her like wings. Rei’s  dark form seemed to grow as she approached, taking the four steps to  the porch in two strides, until Minako’s vision was filled with nothing  but Rei.</p>
<p>A foot apart, Minako could finally see the determined  tension of Rei’s jaw, the intense certainty in her eyes and the soft  set of her mouth. The hum of the car’s engine and the wind moving past  them faded into nothing. Minako sucked in a breath. <em>She’s going to</em> . . .</p>
<p>Smooth  and moist, Rei’s lips pressed softly to Minako’s and the miko’s right  hand, warm, rose to cup her cool cheek. As automatically and naturally  as breathing, Minako responded, her hands fisting in Rei’s coat to pull  their bodies flush, lips returning the kiss with relief, joy,  desperation, ecstasy.</p>
<p>They paused only briefly now and then to  catch their breaths, clinging tightly as if scared of letting go and  losing their places in each others’ arms. Too soon, it seemed to  Minako, Rei was pulling away, stealing her hands and lips back to  herself.</p>
<p>“My car is still running,” she murmured to the blonde’s lips.</p>
<p>“Fuck  your car,” Minako replied in equal softness and this argument won out  for the next couple of minutes. Rei’s self-control was readily  dismissed by the warm coercion of the blonde’s mouth, her probing  tongue and soft hands.</p>

<p>The last time Rei had been in the  Aino’s house, the couches in the living room had all been pushed to one  side of the room along with the giant, flat screen television and the  rest of the room had become a packed dance floor. She wondered vaguely  if Minako’s parents ever found out about that party or if Minako had  managed to clean the entire house in time.</p>
<p>Once again letting  herself be dragged into the room by her hand, Rei watched Minako  collapse into one of the throw-pillow filled corners of the three-sided  couch configuration. She sat down as well, though a little more  gracefully, and rolled her eyes when Minako swung her legs up and  draped them across her lap. The energetic girl then grabbed a blanket  from the back of the couch and spread it over them both, smiling  joyfully the entire time.</p>
<p>Rei opted to watch Yosh Aino set up the  DVD player as if her attention wasn’t entirely on the adorable blonde  next to her. She was forced to look over, however, when it became  apparent that Minako was staring at her insistently. Their eyes met and  Minako snuggled a little closer to the dark haired girl, raising an  eyebrow expectantly.</p>
<p>With a little grin of genuine fondness that  she tried to stifle through feigned reluctance, Rei scooted over to sit  in the corner with Minako, who immediately took the opportunity to lean  against her. Shifting her shoulder where it was angled uncomfortably  and noting that Yosh seemed to be studiously looking at the DVD in his  hand and only the DVD, Rei snuck her arm behind Minako and settled her  hand at her waist.</p>
<p>She felt Minako sigh happily and smiled softly  at the reaction, rather pleased herself. Her contentment brought her to  the realisation that if dinner with the parents was a couple-ish thing  to do, then snuggling on a couch and watching a movie was beyond  couple-ish. Too bad she was far too comfy to be bothered by it. Then it  occurred to her that all she had to do to kiss Minako was turn her head  and <em>that</em> was a rather bothersome notion but Rei was nothing if not talented at repressing unwanted thoughts.</p>
<p>For  her part, Minako was wondering at the novelty of being cozy with  someone she was attracted to without plotting to get into their pants.  It was very backwards, but also very, very nice. She felt warm,  slow-simmering contentment and pondered that maybe this was what  commitment felt like, what it would be like to spend years and years  with one person, relaxed and safe.</p>
<p>Their blissful contemplations  were both cut short by Akemi Aino’s delighted cry of, “Adorable!” as  she entered the room and set down a bowl of popcorn, giving a moony  smile and clasping her hands under her chin.</p>
<p>Rei gave a start and  a blush. She tried to pull her arm back to embarrassedly put some space  between herself and the youngest Aino, only for Minako to swiftly grab  her hand and hold it captive where it was. Her scowl was, as usual, met  with an obnoxious grin and Rei resigned herself to staying in place,  thankful that at least their clasped hands were hidden by the blanket.</p>
<p>Minako’s  parents settled on the couch together a couple feet away and Minako  frowned at her mother for teasing. Cursed woman was horning in on her  territory and making Rei uncomfortable during cuddle time. Akemi just  giggled noiselessly and Yosh gave her a fondly reproving look before  pointing the remote at the TV.</p>
<p>The movie started and Rei’s glower  gradually subsided, as did the tension in her body, though she couldn’t  help but cast wary glances now and then in the direction of Minako’s  parents. This, the fire alarm, and various other incidents had Rei  convinced that Minako simply enjoyed putting her in awkward positions  and forcing her to deal with them.</p>
<p>That was fine, though.  Awkward, but fine. It was worth feeling mildly unnerved by the presence  of Minako’s parents while being this close to the blonde. Actually, it  struck her that this sort of situation seemed like one that might occur  if the two of them were going out and, surprisingly, the thought didn’t  trouble Rei nearly as much as it would have before she’d met Minako.  Maybe that that was the vital upside to the discomfort and confusion  she had to face thanks to the unfamiliar territory Minako was  constantly throwing her into. She was learning to deal with it.</p>
<p><em>Love</em>, she had said to Erika. <em>Already in love</em>.</p>
<p>Rei  felt a piece of popcorn bounce off the side of her head and turned to  see Minako watching the television with an innocent smile on her face.  The miko grinned and ate the popcorn.</p>
<p>Yes, regrettably it was true, and she was just going to have to deal with it.</p>
