<h1>My Private Teacher</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ydesabrais.html">Yohann DeSabrais</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It occurred to me that for all the fanfiction and lemons I wrote, I
still have to write one about two women expressing their love for
each other. That&#39;s right... this is my first lesbian lemon story,
and it was about time I wrote one!

I hope you enjoy it ^^

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So, how were your classes today, Chibi?&quot; asked Hotaru as she met
Chibi-Usa outside their high school.

The young pink haired teenager responded with a simple glance, but
it conveyed her every feeling. Her eyes were tired and her 
expression just screamed &quot;I&#39;ve had enough of this.&quot;

&quot;That bad, huh?&quot; replied Hotaru to Chibi-Usa who was on the verge
of collapsing under the weight of her book filled backpack.

&quot;You know what the really sad part is? I have a big history test
tomorrow, and if I fail it I&#39;ll flunk that class.&quot; said Chibi-Usa.
This time, her face shifted into utter desperation. &quot;What am I 
going to tell mom? I can&#39;t fail her like this!!!&quot; she said, almost
ready to cry.

&quot;But I thought you&#39;d been studying, Chibi?&quot;

&quot;I have! But... it just slips all out the instant I take my eyes
off the pages in that book, I can&#39;t help it!&quot;

&quot;Maybe you need a little help? Some private tutoring could help 
you.&quot; suggested Hotaru.

&quot;Where am I going to find a tutor on such short notice???&quot; asked
Chibi-Usa.

&quot;Just drop by my place, I&#39;ll be glad to help.&quot; offered Hotaru.

&quot;Don&#39;t you have a math test tomorrow?&quot; wondered Chibi-Usa.

&quot;Yes, but I&#39;ve been preparing for days now, and a little change of
pace will help me too. Overdoing it could hurt me as much as not
doing anything at all. And besides, you know I&#39;d never pass up a
chance to spend some time with you!&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot; said Chibi-Usa who felt relieved all of a sudden.
She threw her arms around Hotaru, letting her heavy backpack fall
to the ground with a loud thud. All around them, their classmates
gave them some curious glances.

&quot;Hum, could you let me go now, Chibi? The others might start
wondering, if, well, you know...&quot; asked Hotaru, blushing as red
as a tomato.

Chibi-Usa released her, giggling. &quot;And they&#39;d be right, of course.&quot; 
she whispered.
 
&quot;Of course... but I&#39;m not so sure that now is the time to let it
out into the open.&quot; Hotaru whispered back.

&quot;Yeah, I know...&quot; agreed Chibi-Usa who then checked her watch.
&quot;ACK! FICE THIRTY??? I GOTTA RUN HOME!!!&quot; she then screamed,
picking up her backpack and taking a mad dash.

&quot;She&#39;s so much like her mother, it&#39;s almost scary.&quot; thought Hotaru.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I&#39;ll get it!&quot; yelled Haruka when she heard the doorbell, and she
opened the door to Chibi-Usa.

&quot;Hello, Haruka, I&#39;m here to study with Hotaru.&quot; she said, giving
a polite &#39;hello&#39; bow.

&quot;Yes, we&#39;ve been expecting you! She&#39;s upstairs in her room.&quot; replied
Haruka, smiling warmly.

&quot;Thanks! Have a nice evening!&quot; said the teenage girl running
upstairs to meet her friend.

Michiru came out of the kitchen and heard the hurried steps of
Chibi-Usa up the stairs.

&quot;She&#39;s come to see Hotaru again?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes, they&#39;ve certainly been spending a lot of time together.&quot;
replied Haruka. She noticed the big sheepish grin of her girlfriend
and wondered what she found so funny.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you haven&#39;t noticed?&quot; asked Michiru.

&quot;Noticed what?&quot; asked Haruka.

&quot;Don&#39;t the two of them remind you of anyone you know? Come now,
darling, try and remember how we used to spend so much time together
before we told our parents how we felt for each other...&quot; she 
whispered, moving close to Haruka and putting her arms around her 
neck.

&quot;You&#39;re telling me that Hotaru... with Chibi-Usa???&quot; replied the
blonde tomboy, blinking repeatedly. &quot;This sounds ludicrous, I mean,
Chibi-Usa&#39;s mother is so... incredibly heterosexual! I still 
remember how she freaked out when she figured I was a woman!!! 
With a female role model like her, how could she possibly fall
for a woman?&quot;

&quot;Who knows?&quot; replied Michiru. &quot;My parents certainly weren&#39;t the
role models that would convince a young girl to openly admit
being homosexual. And yet here I am.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m certainly glad you decided to come forward with your feelings,
love...&quot; whispered Haruka before kissing her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Ah, here you are, Chibi!&quot; said Hotaru as she opened her bedroom 
door, smiling warmly as she saw her beautiful friend.

&quot;Hum, did you change clothes since this afternoon?&quot; asked 
Chibi-Usa.

&quot;Yes, I wanted to get out of my constrictive jeans... do you like
this outfit? I bought it last week.&quot; asked Hotaru, twirling
around to show off her beautiful dark blue skirt and shirt with
matching high heel shoes.

&quot;It&#39;s... beautiful...&quot; muttered Chibi-Usa, hypnotized by Hotaru&#39;s
sexy appearance. She was mesmerized by her long slender legs which
were devilishly brought to attention with stockings that the pink 
haired teenager could only describe as &#39;sinful&#39;.

Snapping herself from her daze, Chibi-Usa got back on the subject
of studying.

&quot;Yes, let&#39;s get to work, now, shall we?&quot; said Hotaru.

For the next two hours, Hotaru helped Chibi-Usa to learn about
history, more specifically the world war II period. The black
haired girl sighed in despair as Chibi-Usa&#39;s problem just repeated
itself once again, her memory seemingly impervious to retaining
any number of dates, events and conflicts.

&quot;Come on, you MUST remember this... the prime minister of England
during the second world war???&quot; asked Hotaru, exasperated beyond
belief.

&quot;I don&#39;t know... Tatcher?&quot; she blurted out.

Hotaru&#39;s face twisted into an angry expression.

&quot;Elizabeth the second?&quot; said Chibi-Usa.

&quot;You&#39;re not even TRYING!!!&quot; complained Hotaru, throwing her book
down.

&quot;This stuff is HARD!!!&quot; whined Chibi-Usa. &quot;I&#39;m going to fail for
sure...&quot; she said, starting to cry.

Hotaru&#39;s anger disappeared, her heart breaking as she saw her 
friend crying. This just wasn&#39;t working, she needed a new approach.

&quot;We&#39;ve been going at this the wrong way I think.&quot; she said as she
handed her friend some tissues.

&quot;I can&#39;t remember this stuff, it just won&#39;t enter my brain!&quot;

&quot;I think it already DID enter your brain, you just need a way of
bringing it back to the surface somehow... and I think I have
a way of helping you do that. You just need the proper kind of
motivation, like in Pavlov&#39;s experiments!&quot; proposed Hotaru.

&quot;You&#39;re going to make me drool with a bell?&quot; said Chibi-Usa,
raising an eyebrow in surprise.

&quot;No, no, no, but if I&#39;m right I may be capable of creating in you
a conditioned reflex... a way of encouraging your brain to 
remember historical facts by associating academic success with
pleasant sensations!&quot; she explained.

Then again she might drool just yet, thought Hotaru.

&quot;What&#39;s your idea?&quot; she asked.

Hotaru picked up the book again and sat on her bed. She opened
it to the lessons regarding WWII and looked at Chibi-Usa who
was sitting at the desk.

&quot;I&#39;m going to ask you some questions now. Think about the answers
extremely carefully, because if you get the answers right, I will
reward you for them.&quot; explained the black haired girl.

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;Get the answers right and you&#39;ll find out. First question: at what
battle did the Japanese drag the Americans into the conflict?&quot;

Chibi-Usa still wondered what Hotaru meant by &#39;reward&#39;... so she
wracked her mind trying to remember the right answer.

&quot;Err... Pearl... Harbor?&quot; she answered painstakingly.

&quot;Right!&quot; said Hotaru, a big smile returning to her face.

&quot;What did you mean by a reward?&quot; asked Chibi-Usa, curiosity eating
her alive.

&quot;This.&quot; said Hotaru in her most seductive voice. Lying on her
back, she lifted her legs up in the air and slowly caressed them
up and down with her delicate hands. She licked her lips as her
fingers traveled along her long shapely legs, and finally she 
pushed off the sexy high heels off her feet, wiggling her toes as 
they were released.

She sat up on the bed again, laughing as she picked up the book. 
&quot;So, Chibi, ready for the NEXT question?&quot;

Chibi-Usa gulped in silence. No way would she allow herself to
answer wrong on ANY of these questions!!!

&quot;Here&#39;s an easy one now... what cities were destroyed using the
first atomic bombs?&quot; asked Hotaru.

&quot;Hiroshima and Nagasaki!!!&quot; quickly answered Chibi-Usa.

&quot;Correct...&quot; said Hotaru, once again putting the book down and
this time rolling her stockings off her legs one at a time, 
teasing her friend with this unbearably slow strip-tease. The
temperature in the room was increasing rapidly, or so it seemed.

Chibi-Usa had to restrain herself from jumping off her chair and
hop on the bed along with Hotaru, the sight of her legs was really
starting to get her aroused.

&quot;What&#39;s the... next question?&quot; she asked, shivering in anticipation.

&quot;What was the name of the German police force charged to monitor
the enemies of the Reich within the countries they had invaded?&quot;

&quot;Err... the Gestapo?&quot;

&quot;Right again.&quot; said Hotaru. Her hands went to the buttons of her 
shirt, opening them one at a time. With a soft sigh, she slipped
it off and threw it to Chibi-Usa who caught it eagerly. Underneath
the shirt, she was wearing an exquisite black lace bra that hugged
her breasts to perfection. &quot;Is it getting warm in here?&quot; she asked
playfully, Chibi-Usa nodding to agree.

While Hotaru searched through her book for her next question,
Chibi-Usa enjoyed the delicate fragrance coming from the silk 
shirt, a sweet reminder of all those times where she held Hotaru 
in her arms. This odor was sublime... the smell of love, as the
young girl liked to think of it.

&quot;Here we are! Which German general was nicknamed &#39;the Desert Fox&#39;?&quot;

&quot;I know that one! General Rommel!&quot; she said in excitement.

Hotaru then remembered that one of Chibi-Usa&#39;s favorite computer
games was a war game opposing the player to the famed German commander
in his North Africa operations.

&quot;That one was much too easy, I better make the next one much harder.&quot; 
thought Hotaru. Getting off the bed, she stood up and unzipped her 
skirt. Turning around, she swayed her hips sensuously as she slipped
the skirt off and let it fall down, revealing her superbly shaped
buttocks to the mesmerized Chibi-Usa. She was wearing black lace
g-string undies matching her bra.

Unable to take her eyes off Hotaru, Chibi-Usa felt herself turned on
to no ends. She could feel that she was getting wet, and did not even
notice that she had moved her hand between her legs, softly caressing
herself to the same rhythm as Hotaru&#39;s dance of seduction.

Chibi-Usa wanted to see more and was waiting for the next question
with impatience. Hotaru grinned, this was working better than she
imagined... and she was getting very aroused herself, she had to
fight the temptation to ask easy questions that would allow her
to strip down too quickly.

&quot;Next question... which US marine general to whom was attributed
victory in the battle of the Pacific later went on to become the
United States president?&quot; she asked.

This was a tough one indeed for Chibi-Usa. She grabbed her head
in both hands, trying to squeeze the answer out of her brain. She
knew this would get really interesting if she got the answer right,
so she wracked her mind to get the right name out. After about a
minute, she blurted out the only name she could think of...

&quot;EISENHOWER!&quot;

Hotaru looked in her book, then at Chibi-Usa, then at the book again.
The suspense was killing the pink haired girl, so Hotaru smiled.

&quot;Correct.&quot; she said with a smile.

Chibi-Usa silently worded a big &quot;YES!&quot;, her mouth then hanging open
as Hotaru sat on the bed again, turning her back to her as she
unsnapped her bra and slipped the straps off her shoulders. Turning
back around, she held up an arm over her breasts, hiding herself
from the hungry eyes of Chibi-Usa and waving around her bra with
her free hand.

&quot;Don&#39;t I get a peek?&quot; pleaded Chibi-Usa.

&quot;Only if you get the last one right! And now, for my panties...
where was signed the treaty between the French and the German which
stated that the French would not further resist the German 
invasion?&quot;

Chibi-Usa thought long and hard, then smiled. She got up from the
desk chair and walked over to Hotaru, sitting next to her on the
bed and whispering the answer.

&quot;Vichy.&quot;

&quot;Right you are, Chibi... would you help me out of these?&quot; she asked
her lover, pulling her arm away from her chest as she laid down on
the bed.

Chibi-Usa was more than happy to fulfill the request, and she gently
pulled down on her undies, giving her full view of her completely
naked body.

&quot;Need some help with your own clothes, Chibi?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love that.&quot;

Their lips locked while the two of them started to remove the
suddenly all too restrictive pink sweater and jeans of Chibi-Usa,
their hands then free to explore each other&#39;s bodies.

Pushing Chibi-Usa on her back, Hotaru&#39;s hands and lips went for her
breasts, licking and caressing her delicate pink nipples.

&quot;Ooooooh...&quot; moaned Chibi-Usa.

Hotaru giggled and gently suckled on her soft flesh, enjoying
every second of it.

&quot;How do you like having a private tutor, Chibi?&quot; she stopped a
few seconds to ask her.

&quot;I should have done this a loooooong time ago...&quot; she replied,
sighing and caressing Hotaru&#39;s shoulders and back.

&quot;Do you feel ready for that test now?&quot; asked Hotaru.

&quot;Oh yeah... bring it on, I can take it...&quot; replied Chibi-Usa.

&quot;If you insist...&quot; said the black haired girl, moving down along
Chibi-Usa&#39;s body, her lips caressing her bellybutton on her way
to her lover&#39;s most precious treasure.

Chibi-Usa spread her legs open, knowing only too well what her
lover wanted to do- and she was dying for it. Hotaru&#39;s fingers
softly brushed her pink pubic hair neatly shaved in a very sexy
bikini trim and she just admired it for a moment.

&quot;Please...&quot; begged Chibi-Usa.

Hotaru didn&#39;t take any longer, placing her lips on the soft folds
of Chibi-Usa&#39;s womanhood, giving her the most intimate kiss lovers
can share. Chibi-Usa felt a spark of pleasure shoot through her
body, feeding the fire that grew inside her and rapidly turning
it into a raging inferno.

&quot;Oh god, that feels so good...&quot; moaned Chibi-Usa while Hotaru&#39;s
tongue caressed her all the way to paradise.

To Hotaru, this was wonderful as well, as she tasted her lover in 
a way she knew no one else ever would. This was an experience that
they had shared many times before, and it brought them a little
closer every time.

&quot;Hmmm... you&#39;re so good to me, Hotaru, let me give you the same
pleasure too...&quot; said Chibi-Usa, sitting up and hugging Hotaru
again, kissing her passionately and slipping her tongue in her
mouth. Their tongues twisted around, darting in and out while
their hands roamed freely on each other&#39;s satin skin.

Under Chibi-Usa&#39;s silent directions, Hotaru laid down on her back,
spreading her legs apart. Chibi-Usa smiled and gently laid down
over her lover.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; wondered Hotaru.

&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; replied Chibi-Usa, putting her lips over Hotaru&#39;s.

Closing her eyes for this kiss, Hotaru couldn&#39;t see what her
friend was doing, but she quickly understood. Chibi-Usa had moved 
herself so that her most intimate area would be in contact with 
hers, and started to move her hips forward and back in a smooth
motion, rubbing their pleasure centers together in a maddening
rush of sensation.

&quot;Ooooh...&quot; groaned Hotaru, throwing her legs around Chibi-Usa&#39;s
hips and swaying them along with her to increase the feeling she
was receiving from this unexpected position.

As their precious jewels got into close contact, they both felt
themselves about to explode.

&quot;Chibi... I... love... you!!!&quot; said Hotaru as she fell over the 
edge, her orgasm rocking her body and dragging over Chibi-Usa 
into the same earth shaking experience.

&quot;I... love.. you too... Hotaru...&quot; said Chibi-Usa, panting and
totally exhausted. She barely had the strength to move, but she
didn&#39;t really want to. She was in the one place in the world
where nothing could attain her, no one could hurt her, Hotaru&#39;s
arms.

&quot;Wow... that was incredible...&quot; said Hotaru.

&quot;You bring out the best in me, Hotaru... say, don&#39;t you have
a geography test you have to study for next week?&quot;

&quot;Hm, yes I do... I could use some tutoring!&quot; giggled Hotaru.

They both laughed and kissed again.
