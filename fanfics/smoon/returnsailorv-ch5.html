<h1>The Return of Sailor V (part 5 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sailorjane.html">SailorJane</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/returnsailorv-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>THE POLICE STATION 

Paul Sirico and Sebastian Dante sat at their desks in their own private room at the police 
station. They had traded their blue officer uniforms for suits and ties, along with 
Sergeant badges in recognition of apprehending the Jewel thieves. 

What did they look like? Well Sirico was of Italian decent, black pompadour hair, hazel 
eyes and slightly tanned complexion, maybe in his late 20s. Even with a suit on, one could 
tell he was muscular. Dante was a mix of Irish and Italian. His dark brown hair fell down 
the back of his neck and his face was more grave. His blue eyes were always busy. His lean 
form was not quite as visible through his suit. He looked a little bit older, maybe in his 
early 30s. 

Sirico has his head in the paper as Dante continued to look through files and photos. 
Annoyed seeing his partner pre-occupied, Dante snatched the paper away from him: 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Dante said, &quot;Is this case boring you?&quot; 

Sirico rolled his eyes, before grabbing his paper back. &quot;I&#39;m reading about Sailor V,&quot; He 
replied. &quot;She made the front page again!&quot; 

Dante laughed, &quot;What, you got a hard-on for her or something?&quot; 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Sirico pointed to his partner, &quot;You&#39;d have to be gay not to get excited looking at 
this girl.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t get excited looking at her.&quot; 

&quot;I rest my case,&quot; Sirico smiled. 

Dante looked back to his files, &quot;Well, to tell you the truth, I wouldn&#39;t mind having Sailor 
V to help us out with this Sollozzo crap.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah well,&quot; Sirico put the paper down, &quot;We don&#39;t exactly know how to get in contact with 
her.&quot; 

A woman in uniform walked in unexpectedly, &quot;Excuse me boys,&quot; she said, &quot;There are two girls 
here to see you.&quot; 

&quot;Ah perfect,&quot; Sirico smiled, &quot;One for me-&quot; He looked over to Dante and back, &quot;And another 
one for me!&quot; He laughed at his own joke. 

&quot;They say who they are?&quot; Dante asked without paying any attention to his partner. 

&quot;One girl&#39;s blonde, Mina, and the other one, Amy, has blue hair.&quot; The officer stood there. 

Dante and Sirico&#39;s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets when they turned to each other. 

&quot;Let em in,&quot; Sirico pointed to the door. 

The officer gestured for the two girls to come toward her. In walked the blonde beauty with 
the red bow to accent her hair. Sirico could not help but stare at her statuesque figure. 
Even as a civilian in jeans and a slim-coat, the same woman who took the alias of Sailor V 
was a walking Goddess. Behind her was her blue-haired friend. Her pretty face still shined 
through her eyeglasses, but her figure was hidden behind more layers of clothing. 

Sirico stood up and walked towards the girls, &quot;Mina,&quot; he smiled, &quot;Amy, good to see you two 
again.&quot; 

&quot;You as well officer,&quot; Amy shook his hand politely. 

&quot;Uh Babs,&quot; Dante said to the officer from his desk, &quot;Make sure nobody disturbs us.&quot; 

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Babs said as she closed the door. 

Sirico shook Mina&#39;s hand while staring at her, &quot;So this is the famous Sailor Venus!&quot; 

Mina&#39;s eyes vacillated, &quot;Uh... yeah.&quot; 

Sirico continued to stare at her smiling. 

Mina looked uncomfortably at her hand still intertwined with the officer&#39;s, &quot;Uh, you can 
let go of my hand now.&quot; 

&quot;Oh,&quot; Sirico let go of her hand, &quot;Sorry.&quot; 

Dante leaned his forehead onto his fingers closing his eyes. 

&quot;Anyway,&quot; the black-haired Sergeant said as he walked back behind the desk, &quot;What can I do 
you for?&quot; Dante jerked his head towards his partner. &quot;I mean,&quot; Sirico stuttered, &quot;What can 
I do for you? Not in any kind of weird way or anything-&quot; 

Sirico&#39;s mouth wandered as Mina looked at Amy with annoyance. 

Dante finally interjected, &quot;Please, have a seat.&quot; 

Mina immediately sat down at the chair across from Dante thanking him. Amy took the chair 
across from Sirico. 

&quot;You&#39;ll have to forgive my partner,&quot; Dante said with a stern face, &quot;He&#39;s an idiot.&quot; Sirico 
rolled his eyes and hid his face. &quot;So what can I do for you two?&quot; 

&quot;We want to work with you guys,&quot; Mina spoke up. 

Dante raised an eyebrow, &quot;Work with us? You mean as cops?&quot; 

&quot;Not as cops,&quot; Mina said, &quot;But as-&quot; Mina tried to find the right words to say. 

&quot;Allies of the police force,&quot; Amy interjected softly. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; 

Sirico scratched his head, &quot;I&#39;m a little confused, you two are members of Sailor Moon&#39;s 
Sailors Scouts. Is that right?&quot; 

The heroines sat silently before Amy spoke up, &quot;Given the circumstances, we&#39;d prefer not to 
give away too much information. We trust the two of you but-&quot; 

&quot;Listen,&quot; Dante put his hands up, &quot;Anything that is said here never leaves this room. I do 
some work for the witness protection program and I&#39;m sworn to secrecy. We both know how to 
keep secrets.&quot; He looked to his partner, &quot;Well... one of us anyway.&quot; 

Sirico gave him a dirty look. 

Amy and Mina looked at each other. They could almost communicate without saying anything to 
each other, almost telepathically. Mina spoke up: 

&quot;Sailor Moon needs to be kept safe. There&#39;s a contract for her life. If word ever got out 
that Sailor Moon was in New York City, it could be the end for her.&quot; 

Sirico&#39;s eyes lifted to hear this. &quot;Sailor V,&quot; Sirico stuttered, &quot;Venus... Mina,&quot; He shook 
his head to gather his thoughts. &quot;Why don&#39;t you just tell us everything from the start.&quot; 

Mina did.
