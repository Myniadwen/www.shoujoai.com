<pre>: I still hear your voice, when you

Sleep, next to me...:

I still couldn&#39;t believe it...

Rei was dead.

She was gone. And this time, I knew that even the Silver Crystal&#39;s power 
couldn&#39;t bring her back. I could still hear her voice, rough and hoarse 
with pain and sleep, whispering my name...

: I still feel your touch,

In my dreams...:

There&#39;s peace here. A quite tranquility in this sea of never ending 
white.

It&#39;s so much different than the darkness, the prison that trapped my 
body, soul, and mind before.

But I don&#39;t feel happy, or peaceful here. A gaping hole resides in my 
chest. And I know why.

Usagi...I was so far away from her. I can still feel her lips on my 
forehead, her hand, tiny and fragile, gripping mine.

: For give me, my weakness, but I

Don&#39;t know why. Without you

It&#39;s hard, to survive....:

I looked over the railing of the bridge, churning black waters beckoning 
me.

It would be so easy, to just cast away the shackles of destiny and fate, 
to simply leap and be with Rei again.

Tears streamed down my face as I slowly raised a foot and set it on one 
of the five rails...

: &#39;Cause every time we touch,

I get this feeling...:

Thinking about her fills me with so many emotions...

Pain, joy, love, hate, everything. When she used to touch my hand, or my 
face, I remember feeling so much. My mind had always gone blank then, 
didn&#39;t it?

: And every time we kiss,

I swear I could fly...:

I regret never kissing her. I regret never mustering up the courage to 
tell her how I feel, before she...

I placed a second foot on the first railing and breathed out a sob.

: Can&#39;t you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last,

I need you by my side...:

I know something&#39;s wrong.

In this white sanctuary, I can feel my heart pounding in terror. It 
always did when Usagi was in danger of a youma or another enemy.

But this felt different...She was in so much pain...

Usa....I need you...I need to find you!

: &#39;Cause every time we touch,

I feel the static,

And every time we kiss I reach for the sky...:

Oh Rei...

I couldn&#39;t breathe as I lifted my right foot onto the second railing, 
shrieking when it nearly slipped. The rain that was once drizzling was 
now pouring, lightning breaking the darkness.

Rei...

: Can&#39;t you feel my heart beat slow,

I can&#39;t let you go...

I want you in my life...:

Rei gasped in pain as her body awoke, reminding her that she was still 
alive as she shot up, ripping the tubes that had been supplying oxygen 
out of her throat and nose.

&quot;Oh my God!&quot; the nurse who had been attending her screamed.

&quot;Where is she?!&quot; Rei asked voice hoarse.

&quot;Oh my God, y-you shouldn&#39;t even be-oh God you actually woke up!&quot; the 
nurse rambled.

Rei growled and grabbed the frantic woman&#39;s shoulders, shaking her 
roughly. &quot;Where is she?!&quot; she bellowed.

&quot;Wh-who?&quot; the nurse squeaked. The raven haired girl&#39;s eyes were alight 
in fury and tinged with a slight madness.

&quot;Usagi! Where is she?!&quot;

&quot;M-Ms. Tsukino left a few h-hours ago! S-she thought you were dead, 
but-&quot;

:Where. Did. She. Run off to?&quot; Rei asked through clenched teeth. The 
overwhelming feeling that Usagi was in danger was driving her mad, panic 
driving icy daggers into her heart.

&quot;T-Tokyo Bridge!&quot; The nurse wailed.

Rei cursed savagely under her breath and grabbed her street clothes, 
changing into them in record time. She sprinted down the stairs and out 
of the lobby.

Usagi...I&#39;m coming...

: Your arms are my castle,

Your heart is my sky...:

Usagi climbed up two more rails.

Her breath came fast and choppy as she stared at the river&#39;s rushing 
waters. She moved her left foot, slowly over the edge. Lightning broke 
the sky and thunder rumbled not two seconds after it. The rain pelted 
her and the wind pushed harshly at her back..

She trembled as her foot dangled. One step. That was all that separated 
her and Rei.

Closing her eyes, she began to fall...

...only to gasp when a hand grabbed her arm and pulled her flush against 
another, her savior&#39;s harsh breath tickling her ear.

&quot;You stupid idiot.&quot; A voice growled.

Usagi&#39;s eyes filled with fresh tears and a sob escaped her throat.

It couldn&#39;t be...

&quot;Rei?&quot; Usagi whimpered. I&#39;m dreaming she thought dazedly.

&quot;Don&#39;t you ever do that again.&quot; Rei pleaded against her neck. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
ever try something that stupid-&quot;

&quot;Rei!&quot; Usagi wailed, throwing her arms around the miko, holding her as 
close as she could.

She repeated her friend&#39;s name over and over again, even as she felt Rei 
whisper soothing words into her ear.

Rei...Rei...Rei...

: They wipe away tears,

That I cry...:

&quot;Usagi,&quot; Rei murmured, &quot;Why did you try to...to...&quot;

&quot;I wanted to be with you,&quot; the blonde whispered, sliding her hands up 
Rei&#39;s shirt to feel the warm flesh of her back.

Rei shivered and tightened the grip around Usagi&#39;s waist.

: The good and the bad times,

We&#39;ve been, through them all...:

Usagi buried her face on the crook of Rei&#39;s neck, kissing the flesh 
there. She heard Rei gasp, but she didn&#39;t care. Trailing kisses up her 
Senshi&#39;s jaw, she gently kissed the corner of Rei&#39;s mouth, her heart 
pounding.

Rei pulled back and locked eyes with her princess. Trembling, she slowly 
closed the distance, timidly skimming the skin of their lips together. 
She pulled back again to gauge her princess&#39;s reaction. Usagi looked at 
her, eyes hooded.

&quot;U-Usagi?&quot; Rei stuttered. Usagi&#39;s answer, was to thread her finger&#39;s 
through Rei wet hair, bringing the miko&#39;s head down to meet hers firmly.

: You make me rise

When I fall...:

Rei&#39;s eyelids fluttered closed as she gently returned the kiss, feeling 
a little nervous. They parted, gsaping for breath. Lightning flashed 
across the sky, highlighting the miko&#39;s face. Usagi leaned up again, 
drawn by the everlasting warmth the fire goddes seemed to produce. &quot;I 
love you...&quot; she whispered against the silky skin of Rei&#39;s neck.

:: Cause eveytime we touch, I get this feeling,

Everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly ::

She felt Rei&#39;s body shudder and suddenly, lips found hers again, 
despreste, searching. She moaned in her throat as Rei clung to her 
tighter, kissing her roughly. It was passionate, it was animalistic.

It was claiming.

Usagi gasped as Rei lightly bit her lower lip, granting the frantic miko 
entrance. And suddenly, it felt like she was kissing the heart of the 
flame, the essence of her Rei.

::Can&#39;t you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last.

Need you by my side,::

They broke apart, Usagi following Rei&#39;s lips for a few more kisses, a 
few more seconds of lovely contact. Rei panted heavily and rested her 
forhead against the moon hime&#39;s. &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; she whimpered, kissing Usagi&#39;s 
eyelids gently. &quot;don&#39;t say things like that. Not if you don&#39;t plan on 
carrying it out.&quot; Usgai gasped and frmaed her miko&#39;s face with both 
hands.

:: Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static

Eveytime we kiss, I reach for the sky,

Can&#39;t you feel my heart beat slow,

I can&#39;t let you go,

Want you in my life...::

&quot;I plan on carrying it out,&quot; she whispered, kissing the cleft of her 
chin. &quot;and I plan on buying a disobedience collar.&quot;

Rei pulled back in surprise, a blush coating her cheeks as 
the...possibilities traveled through her head. &quot;W-Why would you need 
that?&quot;

Usagi giggled and pulled the flustered miko closer to her body, trying 
to meld herself to the other girl if possible. &quot;So that you don&#39;t jump 
in front of attacks again,&quot; she murmured. Rei sobered and pulled Usagi 
back by her shoulders.

&quot;I&#39;d jump in front of anything for you,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#39;d die again 
and again for you.&quot; As she saw silvery tears travel down her princess&#39;s 
face, she wiped them off with her thumb. &quot;I&#39;d kill anything that would 
try to take you from me.&quot;

:: Everytime we touch, I get this feeling...::

&quot;I&#39;d swim through glass and acid if it meant that I&#39;d save you.&quot; She 
kissed the rail of tears away, savoring the salty taste on her taste 
buds.

:: Everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly...::

&quot;Can&#39;t you see,&quot; she continued, her voice lowering down to a sexy purr. 
&quot;I&#39;d move Heaven and Hell, just to see you.&quot; Rei kissed away more tears, 
slowly making her way to Usagi&#39;s mouth.

&quot;I love you.&quot;

:: Can&#39;t you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last...::

&quot;Say it again,&quot; Usagi whimpered, meeting Rei&#39;s lips with her own. 
&quot;please, say it one more time.&quot;

::Need you by my side

Cause everytim we touch, I feel the static,

Everytim we kiss I reach for the sky.

Can&#39;t you feel my heart be slow, I can&#39;t let you go...::

&quot;I love you Usa...my Savior...&quot;

:: Want you in my life...::</pre>
