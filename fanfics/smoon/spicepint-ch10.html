<h1>Spice with a Pint of Life (part 10 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Hot...hot...hot...why was I doing this again?

Mina and I were dressed up in our usual disguises again, the same ones 
we used the previous day. It was back to the boiler but only worse 
because today was warmer than it was yesterday. The sun was pure 
torture! It was enough to make someone think, &#39;who would be stupid 
enough to wear a suit on a day like this&#39;? Well it was probably what 
every person that passed us stared at me for. I mean, even Mina was 
sweating and she was wearing practically nothing!

&quot;If...If you like, I can take you out. We can do whatever you want to 
do.&quot;

Oh how I regretted those words now. If I&#39;m lucky, maybe she&#39;ll want to 
stop in the shade for a bit or maybe we could go for some ice cream. I 
know I could go for either one, anything for some relief.

&quot;Hot enough for you dear?&quot; I heard Mina casually comment. The smirk 
behind those words was too evident though; she wasn&#39;t even trying to 
hide it.

&quot;Not funny.&quot; I growled back. &quot;Let&#39;s switch positions sometime and see 
how much you like it. Besides, you don&#39;t want to walk around ALL day do 
you?&quot; I tried not to beg.

&quot;Mm...no.&quot;

Good.

&quot;Then what would you like to do? We don&#39;t exactly have all day you know. 
After this we probably won&#39;t get any free time for a long while.&quot;

&quot;I know...and I do actually have an idea but I wasn&#39;t sure if you&#39;d go 
for it.&quot;

&quot;Do you think I&#39;m going to back out of my word? Let&#39;s hear it!&quot; I 
practically threw my hands up.

&quot;I want... to go swimming.&quot;

DOOOOM

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; She asked.

But I didn&#39;t hear her. At the moment I was too busy trying not to 
picture Mina in a swimsuit. If I thought a tank top was too revealing 
then...

I gulped.

I silently prayed I wouldn&#39;t get a nosebleed. That would be very 
difficult to explain.

&quot;No, of course nothing is wrong!&quot;

&quot;Great, then would you help me pick out a swimsuit?&quot;

&quot;You mean you don&#39;t already have one?&quot; My jaw dropped.

&quot;I do but I needed a new one. So guess what that means? We&#39;ll probably 
have to go through two or three different suits until I find the right 
one! Aren&#39;t you excited?&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah. Fun...&quot;

Somewhere...someone is laughing at me.

Weakly I nodded and allowed myself to be dragged away. On the bright 
side maybe this wouldn&#39;t be as bad as I thought it would be. The malls 
were air-conditioned weren&#39;t they?

Mall


&quot;Wooooow.&quot; Mina gaped at all the people.

The place was absolutely packed. The crowds looked like cars caught in 
heavy traffic. On our right the path seemed to move upwards while the 
one to our left came back in our direction (Kinda reminded me of an 
escalator but on the ground). It made me wonder if the air conditioning 
would even work in this sort of crowd. With this many people, they 
probably generate more heat in here than outside put together!

Sighing in defeat I pulled Mina into the right pathway, taking us into 
the mob. The faster we&#39;re done the faster we can leave. I 
really...really hate crowds.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry dear.&quot; Mina tilted her shades down to show me the smile in 
her eyes as she said this, &quot;I&#39;ll hold onto you.&quot;

&quot;I am NOT claustrophobic.&quot;

&quot;Sure, sure, keep telling yourself that,&quot; she waved away the comment. 
Sometimes I think she does this in spite of me. &quot;Besides, I&#39;ll make sure 
you won&#39;t get lost.&quot;

A few people paused to turn and look when they heard this.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t get lost.&quot; I said flatly.

Yet once again, Mina ignored the comment &quot;This way.&quot; I heard her say 
before I was suddenly dragged to the right into the nearest store. I had 
nearly lost my footing on the floor from the quick change in direction.

Fume

I really wouldn&#39;t get lost! I continued to inwardly grumble. I go 
shopping too...sometimes....

Swimwear store

I watched in utter amazement at the huge stock of swimsuits this one 
store out of many had. The place was covered in swimwear! There were 
racks all along the walls, shelves stacked to the sides in every 
available space there was and many, MANY stands holding hanged bathing 
suits of one piece and bikini&#39;s alike.

So I admit I haven&#39;t come to this store before. And besides, it&#39;s not 
like I needed a swimsuit to do chores at the shrine. Grandpa might like 
it and definitely Yuuichiro but that was going too far. Sweeping the 
stairs or meditating by the sacred fire did not require any extraneous 
exposure of one&#39;s body.

&quot;So where do we start Min-&quot; I paused when I saw the blonde was no longer 
at my side. That&#39;s strange, when did she wander off? &quot;Mina?&quot; I called 
again.

I started to wander around the store, cursing whoever designed the place 
for positioning their stock so high up from the ground. With all the 
flamboyant colors, the overuse of perfume and that loud racket they call 
music blasting in the store, it was difficult to make any sight, smell 
or sound of Mina.

Greeeat...I mentally slapped my head. Now Mina will think I can&#39;t even 
navigate my way through a store, let alone a mall!

Shuffle, shuffle...

I could hear a few swimwear coat hangers clacking together from behind 
me.

What was...? When I was about to turn around to the noise, &quot;Ah-&quot; Two 
hands covered my eyes, following by a soft giggle.

&quot;Guess who?&quot;

&quot;Ami?&quot; I innocently asked. I couldn&#39;t help but inwardly grin knowing the 
pout that was sure to be on Mina&#39;s face.

&quot;Party pooper. You know it&#39;s me.&quot;

When she released me I turned around to finally met her face to face, 
feeling somewhat indignant that she ran off without saying a word. 
&quot;Where did you go? I turn my back on you for one second and you&#39;ve ran 
off.&quot; I placed my hands on my hips, staring her down.

Mina only gave an innocent expression. &quot;Who? Me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, you.&quot; I poked her on the forehead. She pouted.

&quot;But I saw something really nice.&quot;

I glanced at her arms, seeing the huge pile of clothing she carried. She 
wasn&#39;t...Note to self, when Mina says something nice, she actually means 
something like seven or eight really nice things.

&quot;You aren&#39;t...going to try ALL of those one are you?&quot;

She grinned. &quot;No.&quot;

Oh good, I sighed. For a moment, we&#39;d be here for hours on end waiting 
until Mina found the perfect suit.

&quot;So let&#39;s go then. Erm...which was is the dressing rooms again?&quot; I made 
a mock pose of placing my hand over my eyes as a sailor were trying to 
find land.

She took my hand and began to drag me away again. &quot;This way.&quot;

Five minutes later and weaving through racks stuffed with swimsuits we 
had managed to find the place. It makes no sense to me why they would 
have tons and tons of clothing but tiny cubicles for what they dared to 
call changing rooms. As I stared into a white walled room, I couldn&#39;t 
help but wonder if Mina will fit in one of these spaces, let alone 
change.

&quot;Seven pieces.&quot; Mina told the woman. She was immediately given a colored 
tag and then followed to where I waited.

&quot;Tell me which one you like best okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah okay, but hurry up.&quot;

Click.

Time after time I watched that one door open, only to see one swimsuit 
more revealing than the next. It never occurred to me until now, but 
what if Mina knows about me? It&#39;s true that she&#39;s a naturally 
affectionate person...(not to mention the goddess of love) but now...

I really hope I&#39;m imagining it.

&quot;What do you think of this one dear?&quot;

It went along the lines that I was glad I was in a men&#39;s suit. Blame the 
heat on that.

&quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot;

The woman at the front desk was watching us with a curious eye, making 
feel a little more than miffed. Doesn&#39;t she have something better to do 
than to pry on another person&#39;s business? It&#39;s not like we&#39;re 
shoplifters or anything.

&quot;Huh?&quot; My body shivered when Mina gave me a peck on the cheek.

&quot;I&#39;m over here.&quot; She grinned as blood rushed to my face. &quot;Now I&#39;m 
serious, what do you really think of it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good.&quot; I said again.

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Really.&quot; Can we leave now? Wait a minute, was it just me, or did 
she take seven items in there? She&#39;s only shown me three.

I&#39;m getting a bad feeling...

&quot;Dear, would you mind coming in with me this time? I don&#39;t think being 
outside in the next one would be a very good idea.&quot;

Feeling very suspicious I cautiously entered the small cubicle, waiting 
for Mina-chan to tell me what was really up. There was no way in hell 
that her swimwear could be any more revealing than the last one.

&quot;Here.&quot; She handed me a piece.

I blinked. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; It hadn&#39;t quite sunk in.

&quot;Try. It. On.&quot; She winked.

OH NO! My eyes darted immediately to the door but that demon in angel&#39;s 
skin caught on before I could even make a step towards the exit. I could 
almost whimper when Mina chan stepped up to block the doorway, grinning 
ear to ear at my expense.

It wasn&#39;t that I hated swimming...I just...don&#39;t like the cold. I also 
hate really hot weather but only when I&#39;m in unbearable heat insulating 
clothing.

&quot;But Mina-chan!&quot; I tried to protest.

&quot;Oh I see...&quot; She put a finger to her lips in a thoughtful pose. &quot;You 
need help right?&quot;

My eyes went wide. &quot;No, that&#39;s not what I-&quot; Y-I-P-E!

The next thing I knew the both of us were wrestling around in the very 
tight cubicle. Mina was yelling something incoherent while I tried to 
fend her prying hands off.

Somewhere along the way I had started to lose control of the situation; 
Mina is stronger than she looks to much of my discontent.

&quot;Hey, keep your hands off!&quot;

&quot;Do I have to mother you?&quot; Mina laughed. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be screaming, 
tsk tsk. You might disturb the other customers.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need a babysitter! If I want to scream, I wil-mmph!&quot;

In that instant my brain froze, concentrating on the soft pair of lips 
on my own. Mina&#39;s hands easily began to remove the top article of 
clothing when no resistance came up. At that moment I wasn&#39;t aware of 
her hands unbuttoning the suits button or the fact she pressed me 
against the wall with her body and pegged me down. It went along the 
lines of trying to find time to breathe.

It wasn&#39;t until I felt a cool breeze on bare skin and realized that I 
only had my bra left on my top half that I snapped out of it.

&quot;Out!&quot; I snapped and broke the contact.

I forcefully pushed the blonde out, hearing her continue to laugh while 
saying, &quot;You&#39;re no fun.&quot;

Click.

No fun...I grumbled to myself. I still could hear her on the other side 
of the door. Still in partial shock and embarrassment I leaned against 
the door for support, pressing my hand to my own lips where I could 
still feel the warmth of Mina&#39;s on them. If I hadn&#39;t been stripped of my 
clothing like a child maybe I would have done something different in 
that sort of situation...but at the moment...If she really knew...

&quot;Are you chaaaange yet?&quot; Mina knocked on the door in a playful way.

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;Try to keep your voice down dear. You don&#39;t want me to come in there 
again do you?&quot; I could swear she was smiling right now.

Is that why she kissed me? To keep me quiet? Great, now I was torn 
between yelling and staying quiet. To keep yelling and hope I&#39;ll get 
another kiss or stay quiet and keep my emotions in check.

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;Are you changed now?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Well when will you be done?&quot; She whined. &quot;I want to see.&quot;

After that last stunt I don&#39;t trust her to be anywhere near me, who 
knows what she&#39;ll do next. There must be a way out of this...

&quot;Actually, how about I just surprise you? I&#39;ll show you when we get to 
the pool.&quot;

There was a pause from the other side of the door.

&quot;...Will it be a good surprise?&quot; Came the suspicious tone. &quot;Because I&#39;m 
not letting you leave the store unless you buy a swimsuit.&quot;

Damn...

&quot;Yes...&quot; I hung my head in defeat.

&quot;Okay.&quot;

I reached out and was about to open the door when I realized I was still 
in my bra. Oops...Quickly changing back into my men&#39;s wear, I opened the 
door slowly, eyeing carefully for any surprise attacks. Listening 
particularly for the flying hug shrill (those things are deadly I tell 
you).

To my luck, Mina seemed relatively calm when I excited and followed me 
without a scene as I went to the front desk to pay for our stuff.

&quot;Are you going to keep staring?&quot; I finally broke the silence.

That seemed to snap her out of whatever thought she was having. Her face 
went bright red before she quickly averted her gaze to watch the woman 
wrap our purchases.

She&#39;s been acting so weird lately...

Minako&#39;s POV

What&#39;s gotten into me?

Before I knew what I was doing I kissed her and my hands started to 
strip her down!

I felt the blood rush to my cheeks as I remembered pressing Rei up 
against the wall, trying to keep her from moving about (She squirmed 
quite a bit). Even though it was all to get her changed into a 
swimsuit...I....

I turned to see the miko giving me a stare. I&#39;ll have to keep control of 
myself in the pool.

&quot;Ready to go?&quot; I asked Rei.

&quot;...Yeah.&quot;

Swimming Pool

&quot;Ahhhhhhh!&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but admire how refreshing the pool looked. 
And to our luck, there wasn&#39;t another person in sight! YES! &quot;Rei-chan, 
come over here! Come take a look at this! Doesn&#39;t it make you want to 
jump right in?&quot;

I stop a moment in my ranting when I didn&#39;t get a reply. Slowly turning 
my head, I saw a very uncharacteristic Rei-chan huddling underneath a 
large towel that covered all but her hands and feet.

&quot;Come on Rei! You said you&#39;d show me. Take it off!&quot;

&quot;...bad idea...&quot; I caught a part of her mumble.

It made me sigh. &quot;Do you need help?&quot;

She immediately gave an expression as a dear caught in the headlights. 
Oh come on now, I&#39;m not THAT scary am I?

Reluctantly she finally shed the outer cover, revealing a red bikini 
underneath. I expected it to be red...but I never expected the swimwear 
to look that good on her! It showed off all her curves so well I just 
wanted to trace my fingers along them and see where they went (even if I 
already know).

&quot;There.&quot; She huffed and crossed her arms.

&quot;Arms down.&quot; I motioned with my hand. &quot;How do you expect me to critique 
it if I don&#39;t get a good look?&quot; Grumbling Rei dropped her hands to her 
sides, looking away with a frown. &quot;Mhmm...&quot; I walked up to her for a 
closer look. Then I went around her back. &quot;Mhmm...&quot;

&quot;Well?&quot; She snapped. I ignored the comment to examine her backside. When 
I ran an index finger down her spine she jumped forward with a, &quot;Yiipe!&quot; 
Blushing furiously as she did so.

&quot;What can I say? I never expected you to get something that showed so 
much skin.&quot; I shrugged. &quot;Now... into the pool!&quot; I pulled her over to the 
pool&#39;s edge, halfway between the deep and shallow end.

&quot;W-wait a minute Mina-&quot; She tried to protest.

&quot;Hm? What&#39;s wrong? You can swim can you? If you can&#39;t I can run over and 
get you a cute little lifejacket.&quot;

&quot;I can swim! It&#39;s just...&quot; She stared down at her reflection 
uncertainly.

The light went on. Oh, that&#39;s the problem hmm?

&quot;Rei...&quot; I slowly inched around her while she was preoccupied. &quot;You may 
be a master of fire but you&#39;re still human. You won&#39;t burn out. Now IN!&quot;

Shove

SPLAAASH!

Rei flailed her arms as soon as she reached the surface and sputtered 
for air. Staying a good distance back from the edge, I crouched down on 
my knees and asked, &quot;Got some water up your nose?&quot;

The other woman glared up at me while blowing bubbles atop the water&#39;s 
surface. I could see she wanted to splash me really bad. And we all know 
how good Rei is at the revenge game. Can anyone say &#39;master&#39;?

&quot;Actually Mina-chan, it is rather comfortable in here. Wouldn&#39;t you want 
to be in here too?&quot;

I tilted my head to the side thinking, what did she mean by that? My 
eyes widened. OH CRAP!

Her eyes did the exact opposite and narrowed with glee upon seeing my 
expression as it dawned on me. If I was up here and she was in there, 
how was I going to get into the pool without her exacting some sort of 
dunking?

&quot;Come on Rei, you don&#39;t mean that do you? Right? Eh...hehe...&quot;

Rei blew more bubbles and continued to watch me in silence. I tried to 
walk up the walk a bit into the deep end but Rei followed. Okay, not 
that way. I told myself. As I walked in the opposite direction she 
followed again! That shark!

&quot;REEEEEEEEEEI!&quot;

There was nothing left to do. I really wanted to get in and cool off

...Then another idea came to mind...I wonder how fast Rei-chan can move 
out of the way?

Taking a few steps back again, I positioned myself for take off. This 
caught the &#39;sharks&#39; attention.

&quot;Mina-chan what are you---&quot; Her eyes went wide.

&quot;Ahaha! Heads up! CANNONBALL!&quot;

Tup!

SPLAAAAASH!

Quicklycoming up to the surface I then watched the raven-haired woman 
recover from the surprise attack before giving her a little wave and 
said, &quot;Hello dear.&quot; For a moment we stared at each other like that. Or 
to be more precise, Rei chan was glaring while I just smiled.

AH! Two arms were about my shoulders now.

&quot;You were trying to kill me weren&#39;t you!&quot;

&quot;No, honestly, I wasn&#39;t!&quot;

Splash, splash...

&quot;It&#39;s punishment time...&quot; Rei gave a dark grin.

Oh darn..

Dunk

SPLOOSH!

Sometime later

After finally calming Rei down we both found ourselves floating on our 
backs opposite to each other. I couldn&#39;t help but think how nice this 
was with just the two of us in this sort of peaceful and relaxing 
situation. There were no crowds, no battles to be fought. We weren&#39;t 
soldiers, just ordinary people for the time being.

&quot;Hey Mina chan...&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Do you...ever remember things from...our pasts?&quot; I heard the hesitation 
in Rei&#39;s voice.

Do I ever...In fact, I remembered something only last night. It wasn&#39;t 
exactly something I wanted to remember either.

I was Venus...and everyone else was there too. We all were standing in a 
circle watching Mar&#39;s battered body inside the palace. I thought she was 
dead. The tears wouldn&#39;t stop.

Yet it wasn&#39;t the case...at the last minute as it turned out, before 
Mars incinerated her own body our Princess had forced a soul separation, 
separating the demon from Mar&#39;s own...only...that monster had already 
taken a piece of Mar&#39;s soul into it. The result was an incomplete 
dormant Mars.

Memory, Venus POV

Wake up! Please wake up! Desperately I tried to keep my emotions in 
check, to not run over to her and hold her hands, willing her back to 
me. My hands were fists by my side, shaking angrily at what that thing 
did to her...what I did to her! If only I had some faith and trusted 
her.

&quot;Venus...&quot; All my companions put a comforting hand on my shoulders, 
unleashing the tears that had welled up in my eyes.

But I pulled away from them and began to march down the hall. Their 
comfort was the last thing I needed. I couldn&#39;t accept it, not right 
now.

&quot;Where are you going? You can&#39;t expect to beat it on your own!&quot; My steps 
slowed to a walk. &quot;You&#39;re our leader, try to keep calm, think sensibly.&quot; 
The other scouts tried to convince me.

&quot;A leader wouldn&#39;t leave a scout behind if she can help it!&quot; I spun to 
face them, simply livid now. &quot;If we beat that thing we can bring her 
back!&quot;

&quot;Yes...yes, you&#39;re absolutely right.&quot; I heard our princess agree. &quot;We 
will not leave her behind. But I also wanted you to realize that you 
cannot let your emotions cloud your judgement. It would be a great loss 
to lose you both.&quot;

Swimming pool, Minako&#39;s POV

&quot;Sometimes...&quot; I answered Rei. &quot;I remember a lot of things but some are 
still just coming back.&quot;

&quot;I see...So, what do you want to do next?&quot;

&quot;Next...? How about the market place?&quot; That would cheer me up. I really 
need some.

Manuke&#39;s office

&quot;Sir, there&#39;s a man here to see you.&quot; The secretary informed Manuke.

&quot;Ah good. Please send him in.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot;

The metal door swung open to reveal a scruffy looking man who had 
obviously seen better days. He rubbed his unshaven hair on his chin and 
gave the place a quick eye before giving Manuke a smirk.

&quot;Nice place ya got here...have another job for me I assume?&quot;

&quot;Yes, please, take a seat.&quot; Manuke motioned for the man to seat. He 
reminded himself to get that chair disinfected when his guest will take 
his leave. &quot;Your last performance in the alleyway was amazing. Those two 
girls really thought you were going to harm me.&quot; Manuke congratulated.

&quot;Ya well...ya got me outta jail after that so no worries. Glad to be of 
service.&quot;

&quot;And I am glad to hear that. This next job I require you to take a 
certain girl out, one of the two who sent you to jail in the first 
place. Up for...any revenge with pay?&quot;

The scruffy looking man laughed. &quot;Are you serious? OF COURSE!&quot; He hit 
the desk with a tight fist. &quot;What do I gotta do?&quot;

&quot;See this?&quot; Manuke pulled out a few photos. &quot;My spies tell me the girls 
only left a close by swimming pool minutes ago. It appears that they&#39;re 
heading for the marketplace. Follow them. And when you get the chance, 
aim for the blonde of the pair.&quot;

&quot;So you want me to kill off the blonde babe?&quot;

&quot;No, the dark-haired woman.&quot;

&quot;But didn&#39;t you just say? Ooooooh, I get it.&quot;

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Manuke tilted his glasses up. &quot;When she sees her friend in 
danger, she&#39;ll jump into the line of fire. You can&#39;t miss.&quot;

This is your last chance. Manuke could hear the demon inside of him 
warn.

Oh, don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t fail...

Marketplace, Rei&#39;s POV

I scanned through the crowd, watchful for any possible pickpockets. 
Those kinds of people tend to fester in busy tourist spots like this.

&quot;So why here?&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but ask Mina.

&quot;Well, ever since I started remembering what my old home was like I 
started coming here every year because it reminded me of it so much. It 
would always be crowded and busy. There would be stalls set up 
everywhere where merchants would sell fresh fruits and vegetables from 
other places.&quot; I was aware that she purposely avoided saying too much in 
case someone eavesdropped into our conversation. &quot;Do you remember 
anything about your old home?&quot;

&quot;Not really...&quot; I had to admit. &quot;It was dry...and pretty deserted for 
the most part...But that&#39;s all I remember. I can&#39;t remember my family or 
friends other than you, Usagi, Ami, Makoto and the others.&quot;

&quot;Aww...I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;What do you have to be sorry for? It wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot; I tried to 
cheer her up. It couldn&#39;t be her fault that I didn&#39;t remember things as 
fast as everyone else.

&quot;But it is...&quot; I thought I heard her whisper.

&quot;Did you say something?&quot;

&quot;Hm? Oh, don&#39;t mind me. Ahaha...aha...Hey, let&#39;s go check that out!&quot; 
Mina began to drag me over to the baskets of apples.

Cha-chick.

&quot;Look at them Rei, aren&#39;t they awesome!&quot; The blonde cooed over some 
fruit.

&quot;Mina...&quot; My body suddenly stiffened.

&quot;I like the red ones better than the green ones.&quot;

&quot;Mina!&quot; My head turned around, my eyes darted around trying to pin point 
the source of the bad vibes.

Then I spotted him. A scruffy looking characters crouched down by a 
stand across the way. Wasn&#39;t he the guy who tried to attack Manuke in 
the alleyway awhile ago? My eyes trailed over to the side of his shirt 
where a metal barrel protruded from its cover. A gun?

It was pointed at Mina!

BAM!

&quot;AHHHHHHHH!&quot; A woman screamed. &quot;A gun! Someone has a gun!&quot;

&quot;Call the police!&quot;

&quot;There he is!&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan...?&quot; My eyes trailed down to my suit where the bullet 
punctured right through. Thanks to its bagginess the gunman missed my 
thinner frame underneath. Barely. I must remember to thank whoever 
invented the suit.

&quot;Never mind! Just run!&quot; I gripped her hand and pulled her as we ran 
through the hectic crowd. Behind us I could hear more gun shots firing 
off and a loud series of cursing when the police force had arrived.

Men and women in uniform zipped by us to take down the criminal.

&quot;Hah...hah...&quot;

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

Apartment

Click.

In complete silence we both walked into the apartment room. We took off 
our shoes but I stayed back, watching Mina walked ahead of me into the 
living room without muttering a single word.

Slowly I pulled off my hat, allowing my long hair to fall down on back 
once more. Then I unbuttoned my suit top, feeling my fingers shake 
slightly as I did so; the last incident came too close for my tastes. If 
I had stayed on guard...or if I kept training instead of going into the 
music business...I might&#39;ve been able to sense him earlier and those 
bodyguards from our concert night...Shit.

Flipping the top around so I could see its front I fingered the bullet 
hole at the side and tested how the ripped fabric felt rough on my 
hands. That could have been Mina or me in the same situation...only with 
torn flesh and a large amount of blood loss.

The image sent shivers down my spine. Why did it bother me this much? I 
knew I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that it did, it wasn&#39;t like I was 
emotionless... but it felt like the pain went deeper than that into a 
stronger degree.

An image of a ripped red and purple sailor fuku came to mind. The 
owner&#39;s hand laid limply by her side, the white gloves covered with 
blood.

&quot;You didn&#39;t escape unscathed...&quot; I looked up startled to see Mina in 
front of me. My eyes trailed down her arm to her fingers that lightly 
lifted my shirt and revealed the forming bruise underneath at my side.

The bullet&#39;s air pressure left its mark...She was right.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot; My hand came up to push her back but to my surprise she 
quickly slapped it away and glared up at me.

&quot;Don&#39;t you say it&#39;s nothing.&quot; I was stung by the anger in those words. 
&quot;Because of me you almost...again...&quot; Her words became incoherent 
mumbling. They no longer formed complete sentences but pieces of many 
thoughts mixed together. &quot;If...you disappeared...&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m still here...&quot; I gently embraced her as to not startle her. 
&quot;Isn&#39;t that what I&#39;m supposed to be here for? To protect you, our 
leader?&quot;

&quot;Is it nothing more than that!&quot; She shoved me flying into the door back 
first. &quot;How can you see so much yet be so blind!&quot;

&quot;Mina chan...&quot; I wasn&#39;t sure what to say.

&quot;You&#39;re such...an idiot...&quot; Her words trailed off as she approached me 
once again. I was afraid that she&#39;d lose it and was preparing myself for 
a beating. &quot;You said...we could do whatever I wanted didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;...Y-yes...&quot; Her hands came up and cupped my face. &quot;Mina?&quot;

&quot;Shhhh...&quot;

Her eyes closed as her lips came into contact with mine, lightly 
pressing ours together. It was nothing like our kiss earlier today; it 
was nowhere as rushed or rough. This was nice...my mind finally 
registered what was happening and no sooner had I began to reciprocate, 
she pulled back, eyes still tearful.

&quot;But this isn&#39;t only about what I want,&quot; Her arms fell to her sides. 
&quot;What do you want Rei? If you want I can leave right now. We can call 
off our duo group and never see each other again or---ah!&quot;

Something inside of me snapped.

I had flipped us and pressed Mina hard into the door. Keeping it as 
simple as possible I whispered, &quot;I want...you.&quot; And I brought our lips 
together in a more heated kiss that put others to shame. She moaned in 
my mouth, giving rise to a similar noise building at the back of my 
throat.

&quot;Mmmm.&quot; She gasped when my mouth began to trail feather soft kisses down 
one side of her neck. I could feel her body tremble, hear voice her 
moaning for more.

Yet I felt her hands stop me when my own had made their way under her 
thin shirt.

&quot;N-not here.&quot;

I got the picture.

Silently I took her hand and lead her to our room to what would be the 
start to a very long night.
