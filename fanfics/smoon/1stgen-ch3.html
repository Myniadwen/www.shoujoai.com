Konnichi wa, minna-san,

it appears to be my turn this time. Several days have passed between 
this and the last entry. To refresh your memory. Last time we had met 
Minako&#39;s girlfriend, the quiet and mysterious girl named Hotaru. 
Minako and Rei had gotten in a serious argument about her and we had 
to fend of a sneak attack that nearly cost our lives. This was not to 
be the only one...

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Jupiter)
&quot;Come on, give it a little more... Faster, you have to be much 
faster. If that had been for real you would be dead...&quot;
	I watched with a touch of concern the scene in front of me. 
The young redhead seemed so fragile at first glance, the frame so 
tiny and not at all like the seasoned warrior she truly was.
	Appearance can fool you easily.
	The lithe form was actually much more muscular and tuned for 
battle than the majority of her kin. Not that I had much contact with 
elves... but I remembered a few things. Bits and pieces. It was 
enough to piece together a general picture. Elves were supposed to be 
peaceful, nature-loving and gentle creatures. If you looked at 
Priapos in the heat of battle or during training you often got the 
impression of a wild Valkyrie rather than an elf.
	Currently her victims were the two Senshi with blue fukus 
hoping around wildly, trying to dodge the warriors relentless 
attacks. They didn&#39;t even have time to organize and it would only be 
a matter of seconds now. Priapos wasn&#39;t going easy on ANYONE. A 
lesson that we all had learned very quickly. And she had taken it 
upon herself to torture Moon and Mercury until they would be able 
to &quot;face down a Youma all by themselves&quot;. At least that had been her 
words. Considering the first days they were already lasting much 
longer... The first training spars barely lasted a few seconds. If 
that was her training method, I was really glad not to be a Youma.
	&quot;Tough, huh?&quot; I looked up and gave Venus a shrug in reply as 
she sat next to her. You could see the sweat on the blonde girl&#39;s 
forehead but she seemed to radiate a certain amount of satisfaction. 
I guess I must have appeared the same. After all I enjoyed sparring 
with her or Priapos. We were more or less on one level.
	&quot;I don&#39;t know. They are doing better I guess. The way she&#39;s 
putting them through the wringer I would almost say they&#39;ll come out 
better than Rei.&quot; I glanced at Venus for some sort of reaction but 
either it was very good self-control or she really didn&#39;t care that 
much, nevertheless her eyes remained glued on the trio. I watched for 
awhile and noted with a certain amount of surprise but also approval 
that Moon and Mercury were now working as a team, one taking hits for 
the other, as they tried to fight back. It wouldn&#39;t last long but it 
was an improvement.
	Glancing over my shoulder I saw Mars and Tuxedo Kamen 
sparring at the far end of the training grounds - which I still 
didn&#39;t know where those were as usual with the elf&#39;s magic. Mamoru 
had had some Martial Arts training - very basic stuff but good 
enough - and was somewhat on a level with Rei. At the beginning of 
the late night training sessions Venus had divided most of her time 
between them but you could practically touch the charged air between 
her and Mars lately - ever since that sneak attack a couple of days 
ago.
	&quot;They will need it. Pria wasn&#39;t pleased that they almost got 
themselves killed today,&quot; Venus commented after awhile as the elf 
finally penetrated the two Senshi&#39;s defense, sending them to the 
ground. It had to be mentioned in Moon&#39;s favor that she didn&#39;t 
complain at all but simply listened quietly to the elf&#39;s rant about 
their mistakes. A lot of self-control had come from the training in 
our Princess. She had clearly grown up a bit even before we started 
this but... Now it became even more obvious. You should have seen her 
chiding Mars after the day of the sneak attack. As much as Mars still 
traded glares with Venus, there hadn&#39;t been a single teasing comment 
towards Moon since then. It was almost scary. Almost.
	However, whatever had befallen the Fire Senshi to maintain 
such an attitude. The last days hadn&#39;t gotten her much time to relax, 
none of us actually. In about five days we had fought off thirteen 
attacks and fifteen Youma turning up in the oddest of places, still 
missing a pattern. It drove everyone slowly crazy and patience was 
wearing thin. Between the fights, training, planning and school there 
wasn&#39;t much time for personal life and I could almost swear that 
Rei&#39;s problem was not Senshi-related. She was just looking for an 
outlet.
	Turning back to our blonde leader I noted that she was a 
little lost in thought as well. I could tell she wished Hotaru to be 
here but after some clashes in the beginning between them and Rei 
they had apparently decided that Hotaru should better stay home. 
There was something else though. &quot;You okay? You seem rather 
distracted? Thinking about Hotaru-chan?&quot; I couldn&#39;t suppress the urge 
to tease. It was fun seeing her slightly flush the barest of moments 
and then she seemed to pretend that nothing happened and she was 
perfectly cool about it.
	&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Venus growled and I simply laughed. After a 
moment her expression turned solemn. &quot;I&#39;m just thinking. Those 
attacks have no purpose anymore. They seem to be concentrated on us, 
we came close a few times to be really beaten... Close, not more. It 
is as if they are testing us, pushing us.&quot; I blinked at that. If you 
put some more thought into it, her logic almost made some sense. I 
refrained from asking why, it was obvious my friend hadn&#39;t found an 
answer for that one yet.
	Albeit the mask of seriousness and the thinking pose Venus 
was... I could not describe it any other way. She was about ready to 
pounce. Fidgeting, full of energy and there was that... untamed fire 
all around her just waiting to find release, especially after the 
battles of today. She must have felt my intense gaze on her and 
turned around to look at me with a raised eyebrow, then blushed again 
slightly and lowered her head. &quot;Gomen, it&#39;s just... You never feel 
that? After a good and long fight...&quot;
	&quot;... that you are ready to explode,&quot; I continued, 
nodding. &quot;Yeah. I hardly can sleep afterwards.&quot;
	I looked at her closely, trying to see what she wanted to 
tell me with that. My eyes widened for a moment as I realized what 
Venus was implying. Opening my mouth I only came as far as, &quot;No way&quot; 
before Priapos decided to call an end to the training and our blonde 
leader was almost down the stairs the next moment.
	I shook my head. No way that they were doing THAT in her 
state. No freaking way.

(First gong)
Scene fades up on the surface of a hilly land, covered with vivid 
green grass and a field of flowers. We see Usagi standing in the 
center in her princess gown but without the Crescent Moon sigil, 
Mamoru is standing off to the side in a black suit, watching her with 
a quiet smile.

(Second gong)
The camera swings around, capturing Minako and Hotaru sitting and 
leaning against each other in the flower field. Minako has an arm 
around Hotaru&#39;s shoulders and Hotaru&#39;s head is on her right shoulder, 
their fingers interlocked and eyes half-closed.

(Third gong)
The camera swings yet again towards Ami, Rei and Makoto a short 
distance away from the couples, enjoying the weather. Ami against a 
tree, reading, Rei dozing off in the sun and Makoto, chasing Artemis 
for some reason, while Luna sits nearby shaking her head.
(First notes up to lyrics)
The scene fades black shortly and then shows Usagi/Serenity rising 
into the sky, transforming into Sailormoon in the process, Tuxedo 
Kamen right beside her. The familiar shape of the Moon comes into 
view and the surface draws closer as the pair descend, showing the 
ruins of the fallen Moon Kingdom. Mercury, Mars and Jupiter join them 
shortly, as does Venus without Hotaru, Luna and Artemis to their 
respective partner&#39;s feet. The season logo is slowly drawn over the 
assembled senshi.

(Gomen ne sunao janakute)
(Yume no naka nara ieru)
(Shikou kairo wa shooto sunzen)
(Ima sugu aitai yo)
                       
We see Ami with a book in her hand walking down a street, before she 
looks and turns around to face the screen. The sign of Mercury 
flashes on her forehead and her form is momentarily overlaid by a 
translucent image of Sailormercury.
Rei can be seen with her back to the screen, working on something at 
the Jinja. Phobos and Deimos fly into the scene and perch upon Rei&#39;s 
shoulders. The miko turns around and the sign of Mars flashes on her 
forehead and her form is momentarily overlaid by a translucent image 
of Sailormars.
Makoto can be seen working out, her motions flowing flawlessly into 
each other. She suddenly halts in mid-motion and turns her head to 
face the camera. The sign of Jupiter flashes on her forehead and her 
form is momentarily overlaid by a translucent image of Sailorjupiter.

(Nakitaku naru you na moonlight)
(Denwa mo dekinai midnight)
(Datte junjou doushiyou)
(Haato wa mangekyou)

Minako can be seen with jogging clothes, running down a street, sweat 
pouring from her forehead. She comes closer and the scene is suddenly 
frozen with a close-up on Minako, the sign of Venus on her forehead 
and the translucent layer of her senshi identity. The screen splits, 
leaving Minako frozen in place and showing now Hotaru in her room, 
lit by various candles and lamps, kneeling in a circle of the former. 
Her hair is hanging down and half-covers the concentration on her 
face. Suddenly darkness engulfs the room as well as Minako in the 
other scene. Hotaru desperately reaches out towards the other. For a 
moment her eyes turn blank and emotionless, the sign of Saturn 
flashes briefly on her forehead and her form is overlaid by the 
translucent image of Sailorsaturn, before everything turns black.

(Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare)
(Nando mo meguriau)

A group of four shadows becomes more detailed on the background of 
darkness. A brown-blond haired man, a light blue-haired one, a dark 
haired, very tall and heavy man and a redheaded pig-tailed one that 
looked remarkably female. A &quot;shadow&quot; can be seen looming over the 
four like a cloak covering a head.
Two points of light suddenly disrupt the darkness. On the left, the 
Silver Crystal can be seen and on the right the Venus Tear. A thin 
line of violet slashes through the middle of the screen and shows 
Serenity and Endymion on the left side, Saturn and Venus on the 
right. Serenity holds the Silver Crystal high into the air, while 
Endymion supports her with one arm, the other on the sword hilt. 
Venus has the Venus Tear in both hands and Saturn swings the Silence 
Glaive a few times for emphasis.

A brief flash shows Sailorpluto at the Time Gate looking worriedly 
upon the scene.
                       
(Seiza no matataki kazoe uranau koi no yukue)
(Onaji kuni ni umareta no)
(Mirakuru romansu)

Scene shifts to the Moon once again. Among the ruins, a large, black 
structure can be seen, vaguely resembling a military base. The scene 
shows the Senshi again, running side by side on the surface of the 
Moon, being assaulted by various Youma and other things... The 
Princess&#39;s guard jumps into the air, Mercury sending a stream of 
water and Jupiter a barrage of lightning combined into the enemy 
rows, Mars ignites a few more and Venus slashes through several 
opponents with a four-bladed, cross-like weapon out of pure 
crystalline light.
The scene shifts to an image of the Moon again, hanging loosely in 
black space. A blue, red and green star appears to the left, an 
orange and violet one to the right. In the middle, a bright silver 
and golden star joins the others. The stars are transformed into the 
Inner Senshi, Moon, Tuxedo Kamen and Hotaru, standing beside Venus on 
the right, a translucent image of Saturn hovering over her. The image 
of the intact Moon Palace is added to the background. Pluto appears 
above the group with the Time Staff raised; the Garnet Orb flashes a 
bright crimson and the scene freezes.

(Hotaru)
The house was silent. Empty and silent. No sounds of a television, no 
blaring noise of a radio station or CD player, no children stomping 
up and down the stairs in their usual enthusiasm...
	However, it wasn&#39;t lonely. The atmosphere was not that of a 
cold, heartless place that left you sad and somewhat frightened - as 
the mansion had become. No, Aino-ke was alive in every corner. The 
fresh smell of daily activity was still in the air. Pillows on the 
couch were in various stage of disorder, the kitchen wasn&#39;t better 
off - Minako tended to be a natural disaster the few times I let her 
in there -, countless books, magazines or the like were scattered all 
over the living room, some of the flowers needed to be tended to... 
All in all the house felt more like home to me than the mansion had 
ever done since Tomoe Keiko and her daughter Megumi fell pray to the 
lab accident several years ago.
	That was why I angrily slammed down the receiver with enough 
force to shake the phone and the shelve it was standing on in the 
process. That had been the fourth call in two days that I had taken 
and only God and my girlfriend knew how many Minako had to bother 
with that she didn&#39;t tell me about. Of course I had suspected them to 
call. But that didn&#39;t mean that I wanted them to. It would be nice if 
Otousan asked me for once but no, it had always been that damned 
Kaori or a &quot;friend of the family&quot;. Humph, so much for caring parents. 
I was fed up with this and I fully intended to stay here until we 
could leave for college. Facing the problem of Minako&#39;s ignorant 
parents seemed less stressful than going back.
	Sighing I returned upstairs to our room. I wished that I 
could have gone with Minako. I hated to be alone. Usually every time 
I was alone meant that I was either in my room in the mansion or in 
school. Neither one was really a preferred place of choice. Not that 
there was much choice involved. Being alone in the house of my 
girlfriend was actually pleasant compared to this but after all these 
years of loneliness and isolation I craved the blonde&#39;s company all 
the more.
	Of course there was the problem of Hino-san. The miko still 
seemed to mistrust me even though all of the others had accepted my 
presence by now, even Luna had not shown any of her beginning 
suspicion, she actually seemed a little distracted these last days. 
Not surprising with the stress the Senshi were facing but there was 
something else, I could tell. Makoto and I had actually become pretty 
good friends and I enjoyed the taller girl&#39;s company. I had taken up 
a new interest in cooking ever since first staying with the Ainos and 
Makoto had been all too eager to give me some pointers.
	Usagi and Mamoru were very open-minded about us and we found 
ourselves on a few double dates lately when the time allowed it. Ami 
was rather reserved about the topic but otherwise didn&#39;t seem to have 
a problem. Of course the blue-haired girl appreciated the aid in 
helping some of the others with school. After all finals were not far 
away for most of them. And if there was anything I could do good it 
was studying with which came teaching at Mugen Gakuen.
	That left Hino-san. Even though Usagi had tried to soothe the 
situation a little, I wasn&#39;t oblivious to the looks directed in 
Minako and my direction from time to time. By now I was almost 
certain that most of it wasn&#39;t even me. I was just an outlet. There 
was a little bit of personal accusation in there but that was all. I 
would really like to solve that problem and find out what bothered 
the miko because I had the impression that under normal circumstances 
we might even have gotten along pretty well. Still could.
	That was why I wanted to speak to her personally. Tomorrow. I 
could see that the tension wore down Minako more than it bothered me. 
And I didn&#39;t like to be the unwanted initiator for a fight between 
two friends. And they really didn&#39;t need inner problems with the 
situation as grim and confusing as it was. I knew if I told Minako 
she wouldn&#39;t like it, would insist to go with me. But that would only 
further complicate matters. On the other hand I didn&#39;t like and 
rarely succeeded in keeping important matters secret from my 
girlfriend and neither did she. We had an honest relationship as much 
as it could be with our history. Which only left the option of making 
a good argument...
	I looked up as the door opened downstairs. Mentally preparing 
myself I hoped that Minako was in a good mood. It was not like we 
ever really ever fought in the strict sense of the word. 
Disagreements, yes. But most of them were only caused by worry for 
the other. The hope vanished quickly when my girlfriend came skipping 
up the stairs and stuck her head into the room. There was that... 
gleam in her eyes, that untamable fire that burned with surplus 
energy. Anyone else might have missed it. Anyone else might have only 
noticed that the blonde girl was just a tiny bit edgy but I wasn&#39;t 
anyone else.
	I didn&#39;t completely turn around when she came up behind me to 
wordless wrap her arms around me. The kiss was fueled by a fire and 
passion, a need that made all other discussion topics blissfully 
unimportant and me reeling from the storm of feelings running through 
my body. &quot;Mmmh... missed you...&quot; I murmured incoherently between 
kisses, leaning back into the strong and dominating yet loving 
embrace. For a moment I stayed that way before a particular smell hit 
me and I had to wrinkle my nose.
	Minako laughed lightly, a little embarrassed. &quot;Gomen, I know 
I stink. Be back in a few.&quot; With that she turned, grabbing a towel on 
the way. Minako turned her head slightly to smile at me 
suggestively. &quot;But if you can&#39;t wait...&quot; And with that comment she 
slipped out of the room, down the hall and into the shower. Megami-
sama... I breathed heavily for a few moments and tried to get some 
strength back in my knees. You might think I should have gotten used 
to this by now but with all the battles and training lately my mate 
was always incredible eager. And she was intoxicating today. 
Lovemaking after a day full of battling was probably one of the 
wildest and most powerful experiences so far. An experience I could 
never resist if offered. And today was no exception.
	Sighing I snatched another towel and headed out of the room 
to follow that bundle of energy I called my girlfriend. After all her 
parents were due back soon and we would lose the luxury of having the 
whole house to ourselves.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Usagi)
As we pulled up in front of Tsukino-ke some lights still were on and 
I had the creepy suspicion that I had to fight my way to bed. It was 
pretty late after all. Usually I would slip out late for training as 
we had often done in the first year of being Senshi but the battles 
had occupied us practically the whole day from school over the 
afternoon until this late hour. Must be past midnight.
	I eyed the house wearily. My body ached and I felt like all 
my bones had been thrown into a mixer and put back together. Priapos 
was a vicious sensei and if I hadn&#39;t been already worried about 
staying out so late I would have crashed at the Jinja. Rei though 
wasn&#39;t very pleasant company lately either and that alone convinced 
me to better take Mamoru&#39;s offer to drive me home. It was a school 
day tomorrow after all and after I had been chewed out the first time 
I stayed over at Mamoru&#39;s - under cover of course - I didn&#39;t want to 
risk it.
	&quot;Arigato, Mamo-chan,&quot; I mumbled tiredly, sliding off from 
behind him and taking the helmet off. Mamoru followed my example and 
gave me a worried look. &quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; I assured him, &quot;just totally 
spent. I feel like I walked for days or something like that.&quot; Which 
was more an understatement than anything else. It wasn&#39;t that I 
minded the training. I WANTED to get better. After the first few 
fights I felt horribly inadequate. I didn&#39;t actually prefer any form 
of violence even if it was just &quot;the love for the Art&quot; as Makoto 
often called it but coming close to actually having my head taken off 
from my shoulders today had extinguished any objections against the 
ruthless training Minako and her sister were drilling into us.
	Mamoru bent down to tip my chin upwards with one finger. For 
a moment all the exhaustion was forgotten as our eyes met and we 
smiled at each other. &quot;You did good. I think Priapos was impressed.&quot; 
Normally I would have doubted that but I had detected a slight 
approval from the elf as well at the end. She just didn&#39;t chose to 
show it much in order to push your limits even further. I melted into 
the soft kiss that followed. For a moment there I was in heaven. 
Right where I belonged. My destiny fulfilled albeit all hardships and 
forces trying to pull us apart. For that tiny moment the world was 
perfect.
	Until that tiny moment was broken by an only vaguely polite 
cough. We didn&#39;t jump or anything, instead we slowly turned our heads 
in the direction of the voice, a shower of dread running down my 
spine. I bet Mamoru was sweating. That wasn&#39;t a woman&#39;s cough and not 
that of a child either. Both would have been bad news. But nothing 
compared to the sudden chill I felt. That urge to just jump back on 
the motorcycle and flee the inevitable doom that was sure to follow.
	Of course we couldn&#39;t do that - would only prolong things - 
and therefore as our combined gazes settled on the figure of one 
Tsukino Kenji standing in the front yard of Tsukino-ke, arms crossed 
and a very peculiar expression of frightening calmness masking any 
other expression that were surely boiling under the surface, THEN 
both of us gulped. I jumped back with an &quot;eep&quot;, momentarily 
forgetting my fatigue and almost falling backwards in the process as 
my feet refused momentarily to carry the strain of the sudden motion. 
Thank god... or better Priapos for the balance training she had put 
me through.
	&quot;He he... Konban wa... Outosan...&quot; I tried hard not to let my 
voice sound high or guilty. But my nerves already strained as they 
were by the late hour, the battles and the training session, I was 
ready to crawl up the stairs to reach my bed if necessary and 
therefore trying was more like a synonym for good intentions in this 
case. Shimatta, I&#39;m not up for this, I groaned inwardly.
	&quot;Evening she says. It&#39;s more like past midnight, young lady.&quot; 
I gulped nervously, well aware of the boring stare resting upon me 
and the poorly masked death glare in Mamoru&#39;s direction. I glanced 
over at my boyfriend and could swear he was ready to bolt any moment. 
One look from me told him in no uncertain terms that if he was to do 
that he could search himself a new girlfriend from tomorrow onwards.
	Fortunately or unfortunately - that really depends on your 
point of view - that decision was taken from Mamoru. &quot;Why, hello, 
Chiba-san. It is nice to see you again.&quot; I winced at the voice of my 
Okaasan, laced with honey-like sweetness that held a tiny, very tiny 
note of sarcasm in it. The elderly woman would never admit to its 
presence but it was there. I simply managed to wave, wasn&#39;t sure what 
Mamoru was doing since I was focusing dutifully on my parents.
	Tsukino Ikuko smiled in a manner that left no room to argue 
that on the inside she was deciding upon which course of quite lethal 
punishment to take. &quot;It is so nice of you to bring Usagi-chan home. 
At such a late hour too.&quot; I winced again, ready for the explosion to 
follow. I really, REALLY hoped Shingo was asleep already and would 
not wake up by the following commotion or I would miss school because 
of for once justified oversleeping.
	&quot;Um, well... yeah... No problem,&quot; Mamoru said behind me, 
definitely becoming more uncomfortable by every minute that passed. 
Wonderful. I could tell that that little demonstration in elo... 
eloq... in educated Japanese had not thoroughly impressed either 
adult. The tension in the air was almost electrifying now, you could 
smell the eruption coming...
	It was at that point that all the exhaustion and stress of 
the last days managed to catch up to me. Beginning with only a slight 
but steadily feeling of dizziness that I tried to shake off I wobbled 
a little on my feet. I couldn&#39;t faint here or something. That would 
only produce an unwanted amount of further worry and fretting, I 
chided myself just before finally laws of gravity and physical health 
claimed victory and my legs collapsed.
	My parents called out for me but it was Mamoru who had moved 
with surprising speed and foresight, catching and steadying me before 
I could even begin to fall. A moment later I was surrounded by three 
genuinely concerned people. I shook my head slightly and held up a 
hand to stall the flood of questions coming from my parents. &quot;Look, 
I&#39;m tired. Nothing more, just had a pretty stressful day with school 
and finals coming on.&quot; Silently I congratulated myself for coming up 
with the half truth so quickly. &quot;I REALLY want to sleep. Why don&#39;t we 
invite Mamoru over tomorrow and talk?&quot;
	Otousan was about to voice an immediate protest but one look 
from his wife made him swallow whatever comment had been on his mind. 
For once I was really glad that I had one of the most understanding 
mothers on the planet as she smiled at me understandingly. &quot;Of 
course, Usagi-chan. That sounds like a good idea. Ne, Kenji?&quot; Otousan 
grudgingly agreed and I... I would still be asking myself how I 
maintained the self-control to wait with falling asleep until Mamoru 
had helped me upstairs. Wouldn&#39;t have done good if I appeared TOO 
tired. Right? Right.
	The way it was I failed to notice the communicator beeping 
the fourth time today.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Artemis)
Man, could you tell that someone was rather pissed at the 
interruption and dead set on making some kind of statement. If she 
had been jumpy to a point where even the others noticed before - 
since meeting Hotaru she really had let some of her self-control 
slack in this area - then after the last call she was practically 
bursting. And you could hear, feel and - if you were suicidal enough 
to try - probably see it.
	I winced as another cry came through the ceiling, followed by 
several more. I really regretted not taking Luna&#39;s offer to accompany 
her on that last stroll through the neighborhood. Grumbling something 
along the lines of insatiable Senshi I slipped outside and up onto 
the roof. The mid October air was a little cool but preferable over 
the full force of mating waves that were a lot duller up here.
	It wasn&#39;t that I could blame them. From all the Senshi Venus 
had done the most close combat fighting and that usually was much 
more fueling her edginess than magical attacks. Also Minako&#39;s parents 
would be back either later tomorrow night or the following day, 
making such activities rather impossible... especially since they 
rarely managed to keep quiet.
	Then there was the fact that they had been in the middle of 
it when the call came in. I wasn&#39;t home then but it was blatant 
obvious. Especially when Venus had come sailing in without even a 
word of announcement cutting the Youma that had given a tired trio of 
remaining Senshi plus Tuxedo Kamen a very hard time. The ending was 
definitely anti-climatic that way.
	I curled up and glanced into the cloudy night sky. The Moon 
was only partly visible, spending a few rays of light here and there, 
otherwise the night appeared quiet and peaceful. Quiet and peaceful, 
sure. Beryl hadn&#39;t managed to stir such a commotion. Sure, the 
occasional Youma attracted the one or other attention from the media. 
Other than that though the Senshi had managed to hold their 
activities mostly undercover - excluding the Youma reporter but that 
had been intentional anyway. Now, however, the population was almost 
in a riot and the media did their fair share of putting further fuel 
into the fire. Ever since the first attack on the Taiiku no hi 
Tokyo&#39;s citizens were in a state that quickly could turn into a mass 
panic and some of the more destructive and ruthless attacks of late 
were not helping the matter either.
	There was no denying it. The situation was grim. VERY grim. 
Attacks still lacked a pattern save for the fact that the Senshi 
obviously were the intended targets. Luna and Minako had it gotten 
into their heads that during several of the attacks the Youma had 
came close to ALMOST finishing them off. As much as I found that odd 
I could not deny that there was a certain amount of truth in this 
assumption. That sniper attempt got me thinking the most. Even with 
the Senshi&#39;s senses a Youma that was obviously acting precise like a 
machine should have been able to pull that shot off before any of us 
could have reacted. Right?
	It was almost as if our enemy - whoever they were - wanted us 
to survive, pushing them more and more, testing the limits of their 
abilities. And that really made no sense because the attacks couldn&#39;t 
be staged. The Youma couldn&#39;t be sacrifices. There was no way someone 
could pull that of once, nonetheless more than once. It made no sense 
and that really got to all of us. We had yet to see a mastermind 
behind all this, a leader, a higher-ranking individual.
	Psychological warfare. A thought that let me shiver because I 
wasn&#39;t sure if the girls - and the Prince of course - were ready for 
that. Beryl had never acted like that, not even in the Silver 
Millennium. Outright war was never declared, she simply attacked one 
day. And after the rebirth the Dark Kingdom obviously lacked the 
energy to coordinate attacks with several Youma. This enemy didn&#39;t 
which left a whole set of new questions. If they really were 
connected to our arch enemy as was doubtless the case you would 
wonder how they acquired resources and energy to operate so freely. 
That wasn&#39;t reassuring at all.
	I almost jumped when I was roused from my deep thoughts - not 
to mention that I had begun to doze off - by the body snuggling up 
next to me. Luna looked up from her position with a small and soft 
smile and then settled down to fall asleep the next moment. I let a 
fond smile chase away the smirk as I studied the other cat peacefully 
resting. It was a great show of trust for Luna to do what she just 
did without explanation or protest.
	I knew Luna since her youth and I could not deny that I was 
genuinely worried. She was, bluntly said, working herself to death. 
While the Senshi received their fair share of stress through the 
several battles, we worked hard on research. The continuing lack of 
success was even wearing down on my patience as well. At least she 
had recovered well from the memory block without any signs other than 
a bit of disorientation and suspicion that was quickly chalked up to 
the high stress levels. I really hated Pluto for doing that. 
Necessary or not.
	I had made it a personal task of mine to relieve Luna of some 
of the stress by dragging her along on hunts or silly stunts. She 
enjoyed it, protested madly every time I pulled her away from 
unsuccessful and unnerving research, but she enjoyed it. Our service 
on the Moon had alienated us I realized. We were slowly reviving bits 
of the old days. It was for both of our benefit, to keep both of us 
sane in these hectic times because someone had to. Someone had to be 
calm and collected. And the Senshi right now were in no state that 
came remotely close.
	&quot;Oyasumi, Luna-chan,&quot; I said softly, settling down again and 
closing my eyes... doing my best to block out the repeated energy 
waves from below. I really envied Luna for her sound sleep. And there 
Minako said I was lazy...

Daylight filtered through the curtains into the room and drew a 
protesting groan from my lips as my sleep-induced mind began to be 
involuntarily roused from the depths of dreams. I was not a morning 
person. Never had been. Yet in the last several months I hadn&#39;t 
minded the waking up part so much. Not with the familiar small form 
of my lover cuddled up against me in a majority of the mornings. 
Artemis had dryly commented once that Hotaru was the only alarm clock 
I would listen to. Had chased him around the house for several 
minutes afterwards.
	&quot;Hmm... morning, love...&quot; I mumbled but when my arm came 
around, expecting to find the form of my lover behind me, I began to 
realize that something wasn&#39;t quite right. It wasn&#39;t that we were 
fixed on one position but I could have sworn we had went to bed with 
me behind Hotaru. Or did we? &quot;Raven?&quot; I turned around groggily only 
to find an empty space behind me. Hotaru wasn&#39;t there.
	It was amazing what the protection sense a Senshi had for her 
mate could do. Even if it was a totally silly overreaction. From one 
second to the other my whole being shifted from sleepy to wide-awake, 
scanning the room while throwing over a robe. I was already out in 
the hallway before I even realized that and only then did I get a 
hold on my frantic thoughts to think clearly. Trying to locate my 
lover over the bond became unnecessary though as my other, quite 
normal, senses picked up the smell of breakfast from below.
	I sighed relieved and was glad nobody could see me right now. 
My cheeks were probably red from embarrassment. &quot;Jeez, Minako no 
baka, jumpy much?&quot; I muttered under my breath, as my heartbeat 
finally settled down and normal breathing began to return. Since I 
was already up I decided to take a quick shower... alone. Hotaru 
couldn&#39;t be out of bed for too long because I usually noticed, so 
breakfast should take awhile.
	No wonder I was so jumpy though. I tried to play tough leader 
around the others and while I felt much more responsibility these 
days even I had my worries and fears. More of them than I would like. 
My main concern of course was for my friends and teammates as well as 
my mate. And that in more ways than just one. If it had simply been 
the Youma battles that would be alright but inner conflicts, school 
stress and of course all those secrets from England in the back of my 
mind strained even my nerves to a point where I was threatened to 
burst anytime. I still had nightmares about that battle with Adonis. 
And Hotaru... I shook my head. Thinking about this now would only 
upset my girlfriend. She would know right away that something was 
wrong and I didn&#39;t want to endanger the blissful unawareness of my 
mate about this matter. No way.
	Making my way down the stairs after the quick shower I smiled 
softly at the sight of Hotaru in the kitchen, moving around like a 
professional... Well, she was moving in a kitchen sort of like Mako-
chan and that was coming close to the term professional after all. 
While I would never dare combine Okaasan&#39;s and my cooking some things 
that Hotaru had whipped up lately - especially since she was getting 
tips from my friend - was much better than Okaaasan&#39;s ever had been.
	For a moment a pang of guilt made itself known. Someone was 
missing here. Not my parents. They were, sure, but that I was used to 
already. Priapos was missing. She was my kin sister after all, she 
should stay here and... the elf had made it pretty clear that she 
didn&#39;t want to be obtrusive. I knew that her kin needed very little 
sleep actually and most of the time she was out gathering information 
or staying at the communication center. I wasn&#39;t even sure if she had 
an apartment somewhere or something but knew that my sister could 
take care of herself. Besides, with Hotaru here on a semi-permanent 
basis space would become an issue soon.
	&quot;Hey, beautiful,&quot; I said, breathing in the scent of perfume 
and something that was particular Hotaru as I wrapped my arms around 
her waist. Resting my head on her shoulder I played absently with her 
hair waiting for a good morning kiss as was fashion. After all she 
hadn&#39;t been in bed. I think Hotaru actually was teasing me, not 
acknowledging my presence at all right away. Just as the pout was 
beginning to set in she turned her head and smiled at me with 
unguarded affection which turned into a grin at my half-pout. &quot;Megami-
sama, you are beautiful...&quot;
	Before I could say anything more her lips found mine for a 
few endless moments before pulling away slightly breathless. &quot;Morning 
to you too. Breakfast is just about ready.&quot; She swatted my hand away 
when I briefly let it wander under her robe, overtaken by a sudden 
desire. It&#39;s not that I hadn&#39;t gotten my fill last night... or better 
this morning after I finally REALLY got back but... Well, I couldn&#39;t 
help it. When she smiled at me like this as if I was the most unique 
thing in the world I always felt an urge to show my own feelings in 
the best and most powerful way possible.
	&quot;Minako!&quot; Her tone was a little playful as she began setting 
up the table. &quot;People will think we are nymphomaniac.&quot;
	She giggled a little as I didn&#39;t let go of her and nibbled 
her neck playfully before reluctantly sitting down in my chair. &quot;Oh, 
I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;m only a Hotarumaniac.&quot;
	That drew another giggle from her as she tried to make a 
serious face and form an equal tone of voice for her answer. &quot;Oh, you 
better be. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be pleased!&quot;
	I watched her for a few moments in silence as she poured some 
tea in our cups and finally sat down opposite from me. Any other 
might have missed it. She was acting perfectly normal, nothing out of 
the ordinary. But any other was not me. Her girlfriend, lover, mate. 
And as that I just KNEW that something was bothering her.
	&quot;So,&quot; I asked after we ate in silence for a few 
minutes. &quot;what is on your mind this morning?&quot; Hotaru tried to feign 
innocence, raising both eyebrows as if she had no idea what I&#39;m 
talking about. &quot;Don&#39;t give me that look. Something is bothering you.&quot; 
I felt my earlier worry return rapidly. Could it be that she wasn&#39;t 
dealing with the whole situation as well as it seemed after all? I 
mean, she didn&#39;t seem to be too put off by Rei&#39;s attitude lately, 
even seemed to understand a little. One of the traits I loved about 
the raven-haired girl so much. She was a really compassionate person. 
Not in a way like Usagi who could literally drown you with love and 
affection. Hotaru was more the quiet type who wouldn&#39;t judge a person 
from first experience. So what could possible bother her?
	Heaving a sigh Hotaru dropped her guarded look. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s 
really nothing. Just family bothering and stuff.&quot;
	I raised an eyebrow surprised. &quot;There was another call?&quot; She 
only nodded, expression downcast and a little angry. Angry. There was 
an expression that utterly didn&#39;t suit this lovely face and it made 
me scream inwardly at Tomoe Souichi and his assistant for giving 
Hotaru so much trouble. As expected the usual routine had begun three 
days again. That was a little faster than usual. Obviously my 
girlfriend&#39;s hasty escape from the mansion had not made them too 
happy.
	&quot;Well, as much as I care they can call as often as they want. 
You don&#39;t have to go back there if you don&#39;t want to. And if I have 
to force them legally I will.&quot; There was no hesitation in the last 
statement. As much as I knew that public attention would be the last 
all of us needed right now I would take that step. I had contacts 
with the police and other people from my time as Sailor V who surely 
could help if it really came to that. On the other hand Luna and 
Artemis were about certain that something was going on in Tomoe-ke 
anyway and a public exposure they would surely not want to risk.
	Hotaru smiled at me as she stood up, moving to the kitchen 
door. &quot;Arigato. That means a lot to me.&quot; After awhile she added, 
turning around, &quot;I&#39;ll get Artemis and Luna down, I think they are up 
on the roof.&quot;
	Before she could exit the kitchen, I stopped her once 
again. &quot;Is there something else?&quot;
	The other girl tensed for a moment, practically confirming my 
suspicion and then relaxed again. &quot;No, nothing.&quot;
	I frowned a little at her retreating form but decided if it 
was important she wouldn&#39;t hold back with me. Raven will tell me when 
she&#39;s ready, I reminded myself and went back to eating.

Crown Game Corner wasn&#39;t very busy this time of the day. It was still 
fairly early after all. A few kids from school could be seen, an 
older woman in her mid-twenties playing at a shooting game and 
somehow making the impression as if it was a dead serious matter. 
Looking around I spotted my quarry inspecting one of the automats 
that apparently had some sort of defect. I would have preferred to do 
this at our university and not in public like that but while I had 
classes later this morning Motoki had had his fairly early. 
Typically, today was the only weekday we didn&#39;t have at least one 
class together. Murphy&#39;s Law, I guess.
	&quot;Hey, Motoki-kun!&quot; I called out a greeting, causing the young 
student to glance up from his work and then wave. &quot;Mamoru-kun, what 
brings you here so early?&quot; I fidgeted for a moment, finding a spot on 
the ceiling suddenly very interesting. This was SO embarrassing. But 
I didn&#39;t know anyone else I trusted enough to speak to... 
so... &quot;While you decide whether or not you want to tell me why you 
are here, why don&#39;t you give me that screwdriver right next to you.&quot; 
Mechanically I reached for the object and handed it to my friend. 
Motoki made a few grunting noises trying to fix whatever he needed to 
fix and I watched for a while, not really focusing at all.
	Oh, what the heck? The problem was not going to solve itself 
alone and I had spent enough time thinking and worrying myself to 
death when I should actually have been sleeping or listening to the 
professors. I couldn&#39;t help it though. First all the fights that WERE 
heavily impacting on my studies, not to mention the occasional extra 
job and then getting caught by Usagi&#39;s parents in an unguarded moment 
was not good for one&#39;s psyche. I had absolutely no idea how to deal 
with an overprotective father and Tsukino Kenji seemed to be one of 
the extreme types. I still remembered that glare...
	Blinking I realized that Motoki had been speaking to me, 
obviously finished with his work, and was now looking at me 
worriedly. I sighed heavily, then took a deep breath. Well, better to 
get it over with. &quot;Um, gomen. I was just thinking... Um, you see, I&#39;m 
going to see Usagi&#39;s parents today and well, um... they caught us, 
err... you know kissing when I brought her home yesterday and well... 
I have no idea what to do...&quot; Kami, that WAS embarrassing. I was 
babbling like a nervous wreck... which I pretty much was. Could you 
have blamed me? Those were parents after all. PARENTS.
	Motoki looked at me funny for a moment and I really wanted to 
just disappear. &quot;Oookay,&quot; he drew out the word after awhile and then 
chuckled. I took a half-serious swing at him which only made him 
laugh more while holding up his hands in mock-surrender. &quot;Gomen, 
gomen, it&#39;s just so... Man, you work quick, don&#39;t you? I haven&#39;t even 
realized you were THAT close already. I mean, what did you do, decide 
overnight and over one date that you suddenly love each other?&quot;
	I glared at the other boy, trying not to wince at how close 
the statement came to the truth. &quot;Yeah so? Do you have a problem with 
that?&quot; The look I received was pretty much the very definition of 
doubtful.
	&quot;You used to hate each other, fighting all the time, always 
getting on each other&#39;s nerves...&quot;
	I shrugged. &quot;Your point being? YOU set us up for that date, 
you know?&quot; As an afterthought I added, &quot;And that is totally beside 
the point.&quot;
	Motoki gave a chuckle but then became more serious. &quot;So, the 
dreaded parents talk, huh?&quot; I nodded, not feeling comfortable at all 
with the subject. &quot;What did you do anyway? I mean you two haven&#39;t...&quot; 
He let the sentence trail of at my glare. &quot;Didn&#39;t think so. Hmm, I 
don&#39;t know that much about parent talks either. Reika&#39;s family is 
very open-minded and I was only over there WITH them once you know.&quot;
	&quot;Oh.&quot; My shoulders slumped and I leaned a little bit more 
against the wall. So much for help. I really wanted to get some tips 
before meeting the Tsukino family later in the day. Motoki gave me a 
sympathetic look. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be fine. You are a very 
well respected student, lived independent on your own for the better 
part of your life, still have a little income. Just be yourself.&quot; The 
other boy paused for a moment. &quot;You love her, don&#39;t you? Really, I 
mean? Parents can sense that, when you don&#39;t, I mean.&quot;
	I nodded firmly. There was the one thing again that I could 
attest to without thought. The actual relationship might only be a 
few days old - not counting the time in my past life which I couldn&#39;t 
very well mention outside from the Senshi - but I could say that I 
really did love Tsukino Usagi, in all her forms. &quot;Yes, I do. It&#39;s if 
we are meant for each other or something.&quot; I tried to let it sound a 
little like a joke but the serious tone didn&#39;t help. After all it was 
true, wasn&#39;t it?
	Truth to be told I never really had much time to think about 
it with the stress of the last days. And that was why I was so 
worried. There was still so much I didn&#39;t know about Usagi, things I 
really wanted to find out but didn&#39;t have the time yet. And being an 
orphan I didn&#39;t have much experience dealing with parental figures. 
What the heck was I supposed to tell them? I love your daughter 
because we were already a couple in a past life and she saved my life 
being a hero? Right, that would go over SO well. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t 
have spoken to Motoki after all. I couldn&#39;t tell him all that 
either...
	The other boy had been staring at me for awhile and it began 
to make me feel uncomfortable. Then Motoki suddenly relaxed and gave 
me a friendly pat on the shoulder. &quot;Good.&quot; His expression still 
serious, he continued, &quot;I meant what I told you awhile back, you 
know? That Usagi&#39;s like a little sister to me. If you hurt her, her 
parents will be your least problem.&quot;
	And somehow I believed him. I wasn&#39;t quite sure where the 
difference was right now but Motoki had made this particular 
statement in both the original and the repeated year. Many things had 
been quite similar and that was one of them. &quot;Just try to be 
yourself, Mamoru-kun. You are a nice boy, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll like you.&quot;
	&quot;Arigato, Motoki-kun. I think I feel a little better now,&quot; I 
replied, actually feeling a bit more hopeful. He was right after all. 
I was being an idiot, worrying myself silly. All that was 
accomplishing was to make sure I was so nervous that it really 
showed. I always prided myself to be a calm person and I should be 
that. With all that had been gone on in my life, I should be able to 
handle Usagi&#39;s parents...
	Right?

(Rei)
There was something utterly calming about the simple task of sweeping 
leaves in the yard of the Jinja. It just happened to totally elude me 
today...
	With a sigh of defeat I put away the broom and called 
Yuuichirou over so that he could take over again and went into the 
Jinja without another word. I should probably be up in my room 
practicing or at least preparing for later this afternoon. After all 
there was only an hour and a half left, I would have to leave forty 
minutes at best. There wasn&#39;t even a REASON for coming back here from 
school other than changing clothes... Distracted as I was I had 
donned the temple robes and until now never bothered to correct that. 
Therefore this little detail didn&#39;t became a problem as I felt myself 
walking straight towards the meditation chamber, my feet following a 
force of their own that definitely wasn&#39;t mine. Although I didn&#39;t 
protest. Maybe some meditation would do the trick. I usually felt 
better after that. Of course as luck would have it, I would probably 
end up with a prophetic vision announcing the end of the world. Just 
great.
	Nonetheless I sat down in front of the Holy Fire and began to 
clear my mind... There was a lot to clear. Training, battles, school, 
the audition this afternoon, the Jinja... Training I really didn&#39;t 
mind that much, it sort of helped to get me focused on something 
actually. With the relentless pace you didn&#39;t have much time to 
think. If you thought about anything other than your sparring partner 
it would result in some serious pain in the morning. The battles were 
stressful but more or less had the same result. Ojiji obviously had 
sensed my rising stress level and decreased training a little. I 
ALMOST wished he didn&#39;t.
	No, what really bothered me was merely an hour away, that and 
the combination of everything together. Such minutes as now were 
almost non-existent in the last days, I rarely had time to take a 
breath, just reflect or let go more for more than a short span of 
time. When I came home the bed usually was the first choice.
	Then there was Minako. I hated myself already for fighting 
with her. I knew instinctively that I had deserved that slap a couple 
of days ago. Her personal life wasn&#39;t my business and I had allowed 
myself a lapse of judgment by going after that Youma without 
thinking. It was just... Oh, who was I trying to fool. The reason for 
my recent attitude towards our leader was mostly Hotaru. There were 
just so many things that didn&#39;t add up, Luna had even said Minako and 
Artemis were holding secrets from her. As a miko you just had a knack 
for such things. You know when you think you know something very 
important is there and you can&#39;t pinpoint it as much as you might 
try. And that this something could very well be devastating to you 
and those around you. That was what I felt every time I looked at the 
shy dark-haired girl.
	&quot;...no-san... Hino-san?&quot;
	My eyes snapped open, having almost achieved the level of 
spiritual awareness necessary for a successful meditation. My eyes 
met equally deep purple ones and all of a sudden pictures flashed 
before my eyes. Too fast, too blurry to get more than a glimpse of 
them. Of two young girls, around six maybe, laughing and playing like 
innocent children tend to go. Of the same girls, around eight now 
surrounded by flames, the black-haired one calling out for the other 
one that was slowly consumed by fire, an ominous shadow hovering over 
them and slowly descending. Of the same dark-haired girl crying in an 
older, white-haired man&#39;s lap. Of the same two girls as earlier - I 
could tell - only older locked in some sort of deathly combat. Of 
another blonde-haired girl - Minako? - trying to separate them and 
being taken away by the brown-haired one. Of... yes, definitely Venus 
now crying out for a shadowed girl - a Senshi? - wielding a long 
glaive. A sign was briefly flaring on the shadow&#39;s forehead but 
before I could get a clear glimpse the shadow swung the glaive down 
and everything was bathed into an infinite, black void...
	With a jerk I fell backwards, eyes wildly scanning the room 
as the vision slowly faded away only leaving a startled and somewhat 
confused Tomoe Hotaru standing to the side of the fire an apologetic 
look on her face.
	What the fuck was that?
	&quot;Gomen nasei, Hino-san, I didn&#39;t mean to startle you. Daijobu 
desu?&quot; I shook my head several times to clear it from the hammering 
sensation that threatened to burst it any moment and scrambled to 
stand up. Brushing my robe more to distract myself for a moment and 
collecting my composure than smoothing the material I finally turned 
to acknowledge the other girl.
	&quot;What are you doing here, Tomoe-san?&quot; The surprise about this 
mere fact was beginning to register; the girl had any right to avoid 
me actually and therefore I would have thought I was the last person 
she would come to see on a school day if she clearly would have more 
joy to be in Minako&#39;s presence. I narrowed my eyes suspiciously. &quot;Or 
was that Minako&#39;s idea?&quot;
	The other girl shook her head and moved in front of the fire 
to inspect the altar a bit more thoroughly. For a moment I had to 
fight the urge to snap at her but it seemed that Hotaru was genuinely 
interested. &quot;Iie, Minako has NO idea that I am here.&quot; I had not 
really believed so. One thing had become apparent. My friend was very 
protective of Hotaru and you rarely saw them separated these days 
other than training - which, I reminded myself, was mostly due to me.
	I waited patiently for her to continue, knowing that pressing 
further would achieve little. The girl had obviously come on her own 
accord and she would share with me the cause of that anyway. Right 
now I didn&#39;t mind the silence as I watched the other girl inspect the 
Holy Fire and the altar in an almost clinical fashion. &quot;My mother 
used to read the stars. Not those fancy types who have no idea what 
they are talking about. The real thing I mean.&quot; I blinked, slightly 
confused at the openness of the statement - after all there was no 
reason for her to share this with me - but stayed silent, pictures of 
the vision still dancing through my mind. That one girl was... could 
be... No, impossible. I would KNOW already if it were that way. No, 
it simply couldn&#39;t be. Yet...
	&quot;I never wanted to be the cause for two people so close to be 
fighting. I will not stand by and just watch though.&quot; Hotaru looked 
up and I felt myself swallowing slightly at the deep, penetrating 
gaze that suddenly seemed to betray the girl&#39;s actual age. &quot;Whatever 
you might think. I DO love Minako and therefore I don&#39;t want her to 
be unhappy because she has to fight with her friends. Things don&#39;t 
always have to turn out the way you think they will. I could care 
less about society. But I care about Minako and she is VERY sad right 
now that you are giving her trouble over this.&quot;
	I stiffened a little as the dark-haired girl went past, 
stopping just at the right moment to look me directly in the 
eyes. &quot;Be careful, or you might be the one to do what you fear could 
happen to us.&quot; And I saw it then. I saw that silent but strong 
determination to defend the only thing that mattered to her more than 
life itself. Minako. The realization left me slightly breathless and 
the intensity was no longer deniable. There was no doubt that the 
girl had spoken the truth. Tomoe Hotaru LOVED Aino Minako. But had 
this ever been the problem? Had this fact really been doubted?
	&quot;I still don&#39;t trust you,&quot; I heard myself saying as Hotaru 
was opening the door to the room and turned around to face her. The 
other girl stopped for a moment, hand on the edge of the door.
	&quot;I know. I don&#39;t expect you to. I know the feeling too well 
to care anymore...&quot; There was a slight tingle of regret and sadness 
and for a moment I felt my heart reaching out to her at the 
loneliness in the statement. &quot;Just try to accept Us. If not for me, 
then for Minako.&quot;
	Again she moved forward, only to turn her head back to me 
with a sympathetic look that I truly didn&#39;t expect and that managed 
to rob me the ability of denial at the following statement, softly 
spoken. &quot;I am truly sorry that you had to experience... that. We must 
remind you of... that person and you, right?&quot; After a short pause, 
she added, &quot;I understand,&quot; and was gone.
	Left standing mouth slightly agape there was only one 
question running through my head.
	How could she possibly have known?

(Luna)
For once the morning had gone by without an incident. No Youma, no 
abnormalities, no nothing... Well, except the fact maybe that an 
exhausted Usagi had dragged herself to school to not draw further 
suspicion to herself and was apparently lost in worry for the 
upcoming meeting between her parents and Mamoru. It would have been a 
funny sight to behold seeing my blonde charge sitting morosely in 
Crown Fruit Parlor with her best friend and Unazuki trying to talk 
some courage into her if it hadn&#39;t been such a serious thing. Not to 
mention the irony of Mamoru talking to Motoki at the same exact time 
only a block next to them. I had seen them on my way here.
	I caught pieces of the conversation between the three girls 
but could guess already about the content. Naru actually was pretty 
demure and serious in appearance while Motoki&#39;s sister tried to cheer 
Usagi up. &quot;... really shouldn&#39;t worry so much, Usagi-san. I mean what 
could they possible do? I mean, you love Mamoru-kun, don&#39;t you?&quot; The 
redheaded younger Furuhata said, resting her elbows on the table, 
head in her hands as she looked at Usagi curiously. I hopped up to my 
charge&#39;s shoulder and gave a purr of reassurance, expecting to be 
scratched in turn and a little disappointed that nothing happened. 
Did that really bother her so much?
	I shivered a little and looked around alarmed but there was 
nothing out of the ordinary. That is if you didn&#39;t count a pair of 
emerald eyes watching me closely, almost knowingly. Why was Naru 
staring at me like that? That was really unsettling. It was almost as 
if she knew... something. I wasn&#39;t sure what. Just something. Of 
course you couldn&#39;t help but notice how stressed out the Senshi were 
from the last days and that had to show. Yet why would the girl look 
at ME so strangely? Granted, behind that gentle, kind exterior was a 
sharp mind. Usagi&#39;s oldest friend was not easily fooled and once or 
twice during the fight with the reborn Dark Kingdom I had wondered if 
the girl suspected something about her best friend. And I also 
couldn&#39;t be sure if Nephrite hadn&#39;t told her about Usagi. He had said 
the opposite but still...
	Well, that was something I could focus on later, I decided as 
a low moan from Usagi snapped me out of my trance, Naru&#39;s eyes 
leaving me to settle upon her friend again. &quot;You have no idea what 
Otousan is like. If we don&#39;t do some quick talking he might chase him 
out of the house with a shotgun before we even managed to sit down.&quot; 
Granted that was slightly exaggerated but I wouldn&#39;t exactly put it 
beyond the man. No, on second thought, it wasn&#39;t exaggerated at all. 
Tsukino Kenji was as overprotective as a father could get. &quot;And after 
that misunderstanding yesterday,&quot; my charge continued, &quot;I&#39;m surprised 
we are still alive.&quot; Usagi gave another sigh. &quot;We wanted to take it 
slow, you know? Parents talk was the last thing on our list.&quot;
	Naru reached out to take her friend&#39;s hands in hers and her 
serious face was momentarily obscured by a gentle smile. &quot;Usagi-chan, 
stop worrying yourself to death. Your parents love you and just want 
to make sure you are happy. Most kids our age would wish to have such 
a stable family AND a boyfriend.&quot; I could only agree with the girl. 
Serenity had made quite sure that her daughter was born into a 
stable, loving family, sometimes I wondered while the other girls 
hadn&#39;t. It hardly seemed fair. But then again what was fair in life 
anyway? My, Artemis would have scolded me for that train of thought. 
I shouldn&#39;t be so bitter.
	&quot;Naru-chan is right,&quot; Unazuki spoke up, retrieving Usagi&#39;s 
empty glass. &quot;Mamoru is a nice guy. I know him since he and &#39;niisan 
went to high school together. I&#39;m sure your parents will like him. 
I&#39;m sure your mother will and you should never underestimate the 
power of a mom!&quot; That brought a smile from all three girls and I felt 
a temporary flash of memory and feelings that hadn&#39;t stirred in me 
for awhile. Memories of my own childhood... I shook my head to clear 
it and could swear that Naru had been watching me again.
	Usagi seemed a little more relaxed now and Naru and her went 
to leave, Usagi obviously trying to mask her nervousness by 
chitchatting now. &quot;Did you know that Motoki had a sister?&quot;
	The auburn-haired girl shook her head, glancing back over her 
shoulder at Unazuki already treating other customers. &quot;I had no idea. 
I&#39;m not sure I would have seen the relation if they were standing 
next to each other.&quot;
	Usagi nodded as the two went out into the street, at about 
the same time as Mamoru obviously decided to do the same. The look on 
their faces as they both stopped and realized that the other had had 
obviously the same idea was truly hilarious. To mine and Naru&#39;s 
credit I must say that we managed to contain the laughter... barely.
	They would probably not have snapped out of it for several 
more moments if Naru hadn&#39;t interrupted the growing silence. Pointing 
at the opposite side of the street, she called out, &quot;Hey, isn&#39;t that 
your new friend&#39;s friend?&quot; I turned and saw Priapos in human form 
looking over to us and waving when she was spotted. Interesting, the 
elf rarely was out in public since I had known her. First I suspected 
that something had happened but she didn&#39;t really seem troubled. I 
still didn&#39;t have any clue where she was staying since coming back 
from the scouting mission, only that it wasn&#39;t at Minako&#39;s.
	&quot;Hey... Pr... I mean, Erubia-san... What are you doing here?&quot; 
We had come up with the name on the spot the last time the Efadio had 
been spotted with us. Granted it wasn&#39;t really spectacular but enough 
to cover for her if she was seen during a battle without her glamour 
and being called by her own name. Elves usually know how to mingle 
with the locals without problems.
	Priapos smiled pleasantly and bowed to the three. &quot;Nothing 
much. Everyone seems to be out or doing something today, so I thought 
I might as well walk around a bit.&quot; Everyone was doing something? 
Minako and Hotaru too? Oh well, at least there wasn&#39;t another Youma 
running around. One day of relaxing from fighting might as well do 
wonders for the girls.
	&quot;Well, we&#39;ve got to go,&quot; Usagi said somewhat demure with a 
meaningful look at Mamoru which the taller student returned with a 
wary one of his own. &quot;No better time than the present they say after 
all.&quot; Turning back to Naru who I noticed had been staring at Priapos 
the whole time, Usagi added, &quot;Arigato for helping me out Naru-chan. 
See you tomorrow?&quot; The other girl merely nodded which drew a raised 
eyebrow from my charge. Usagi looked back and forth between Naru and 
Priapos who seemed to take the other girl&#39;s stare with amusement and 
a little curiosity, and shrugged before grabbing Mamoru and dragging 
him down the street.
	I glanced back at the two wondering what exactly was going on 
but decided that more seriously matters should be dealt with now. 
Like giving some silent support to my charge and her prince...

Discarding my jacket and putting the mail on the nearby table I 
leaned against the door of the apartment room for a few moments. 
School had gone by uneventful if you didn&#39;t count that I had actually 
missed the first period because I overslept. Not that I had really 
wanted to get out of bed at all. I thought that we really needed a 
breather from all of this or making the finals this year would become 
a serious problem. Maybe not for me but for Usagi and the others. 
That last test two days ago had proven that the constant juggle from 
social and Senshi life was having an impact on everyone&#39;s grades... 
and Usagi had really become better lately. Heck, even I had barely 
made the A.
	Makoto wasn&#39;t back from training yet I noted. I usually had 
an extra class in the afternoon and the brunette would be home 
already, either that or she occasional waited for me. Not so today. I 
was seriously wondering how my host could stay so... calm. I mean she 
obviously even had time to venture to the other side of Tokyo for her 
training with all of this going on. Her grades had dropped slightly 
but not really noteworthy. I had to say that I was impressed. Not 
that her grades were in any stellar range but they were okay, 
considering the training and fighting.
	I picked up one of the letters on the top of the low pile 
while placing the rest on the table and sat down on the couch with a 
weary sigh. I knew that the letter was for me. I didn&#39;t even need to 
see that it was forwarded. There was simply no need because I had 
expected the letter to come in the span of the next days. Therefore I 
merely glanced at the address, not really reading, more knowing.

	Application for International Medical School
	Berlin, Germany

	&quot;It&#39;s no use,&quot; I mumbled, taking out a small box. I tucked 
the envelope away in it, not even bothering to open it. I knew anyway 
what would be in there. Almost the same as last year. And last year I 
hadn&#39;t felt ready for some reason, probably because of my fate as a 
Senshi. This year, right NOW... There wasn&#39;t even a question, was 
there? I couldn&#39;t let them see it. Even giving the slight hint that I 
was thinking of... No. Usagi would surely start and then they would 
all urge me to go. Follow your dream. How could I follow my dream, 
knowing that my absence could be the crucial part in the downfall of 
the only friends I ever had?. No, they absolutely couldn&#39;t see or 
know about it. &quot;The best choice is not always the best personal 
choice anyway.&quot;
	&quot;And if the best choice and the best personal choice are the 
same?&quot; My head jerked up at the sound of the other voice. Makoto 
stood in the entrance, leaning relaxed against the door. I was glad 
that I had placed the box back already because I&#39;m sure my 
nervousness was enough of a giveaway.
	&quot;Maybe. But there are always equal choices to be considered,&quot; 
I answered quietly after awhile. Her gaze was unnerving and I was 
about ready to show annoyance in order to divert attention.
	Suddenly the taller girl dropped her gaze and stepped away 
from the wall, walking over to me and began to look through the mail 
that was mostly hers. &quot;Of course there are.&quot; For a moment I thought 
she would push further but again I was in for a surprise as she 
looked at me mildly curious. &quot;Did they buy the story?&quot; I must have 
looked really stupid because I had absolutely no idea what Makoto was 
talking about. My mind was so wrapped up with the letter I couldn&#39;t 
think of anything else for the moment. &quot;Why we were late today,&quot; the 
other girl explained further with an arched eyebrow.
	I blinked. No way she just dropped that! Makoto tended to be 
as curious as Usagi and Minako sometimes and she would not let an 
obvious secret uncovered. Not this way. &quot;Uh... err... Sure. No 
trouble at all,&quot; I managed to answer, still searching for a hidden 
tactic to bring me to confess.
	&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good.&quot; And with that Makoto turned to go into the 
kitchen, leaving me a little stunned, watching her back. I mean she 
must have guessed at least pieces. Was that why she didn&#39;t say 
anything? Weird. I had thought I knew what I was getting into when I 
decided to take up the brunette&#39;s offer to share her apartment with 
her for college but it appeared there was a lot of things I still 
didn&#39;t know about my friend. Not that I wasn&#39;t glad about not having 
to explain myself right now - because I really didn&#39;t think I could 
handle another problem at the moment - but her behavior was a little 
odd.
	She had handled Minako and her girlfriend quite well, even 
made an attempt to befriend the shy Hotaru. Don&#39;t get me wrong I knew 
already that Makoto had a big heart and usually was really good with 
people if you let her, especially often misunderstood outcasts. 
However, this new level of calmness was a little unnerving. The 
Makoto I remembered from the first year as a Senshi and the meetings 
during our sleeping phase was a lot more temperamental. Was it just 
the training with her new sensei?
	&quot;Here.&quot; I looked up startled at the sound of Makoto&#39;s soft 
voice. How long had I sat here thinking? A steaming cup of coffee was 
held out in front of me and for a moment I could just stare at it, at 
times glancing up at my friend. There weren&#39;t any unspoken questions 
or curiosity in those emerald eyes, just a hint of worry, a little 
understanding and something I could not quite define. &quot;You looked 
like you needed something strong.&quot;
	Gingerly I took the cup from her, sipping a few times from 
the hot but incredible soothing liquor. Usually I wasn&#39;t much of a 
coffee drinker but Makoto had been right. Today I really needed one. 
My friend sat next to me and I could feel her eyes upon me, watching 
but not really intense. Turning my head to look at her our eyes met 
and for a moment none of us said something. I felt incredible 
vulnerable all of a sudden, as if I was baring my soul. But at the 
same time I just KNEW that as long as it was the tall brunette I 
didn&#39;t have to fear anything.
	I shook my head slightly to clear it and the moment 
passed. &quot;Why are you...?&quot; I began but Makoto didn&#39;t let me finish.
	And she sounded totally convinced answering, &quot;It&#39;s not my 
place. I won&#39;t pry into other people&#39;s business.&quot; There was something 
unsaid, some hidden truth that should have been in this sentence but 
wasn&#39;t. However, for the moment I took Makoto&#39;s advise and let it 
rest.
	Silence settled over the two of us as we sat on the couch and 
I slowly nipped on my coffee... At least until the communicator 
beeped again, drawing mutual noises of disapproval from both of us.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Minako)
Pursuing Rei was an easy thing. Stealth was one thing Artemis and I 
had learned to perfection even before Priapos&#39; training. Of course I 
had known Hotaru was up to something. It was not at all like her to 
just &quot;have something to do&quot; after school. While I actually wished and 
encouraged her to make other social contacts this was not just done 
from one day to another. And if, she would have had no reason to hide 
it from me.
	Maybe it was a bit paranoia that eventually led me to the 
Jinja. I had no real intention to not trust my girlfriend but could 
not deny a bit of worry, especially in the current situation. Not 
that Rei would do something foolish but... Oh well, maybe I was a 
little overprotective. Yet, I had sworn it to myself. There would be 
no repeat of England if I could help it in any way. We had come so 
close to losing each other. If I came about as the overprotective 
girlfriend, fine. That I could deal with.
	So... Why was I trailing Rei?
	The miko had seem to be utterly distraught when she left the 
Jinja in a hurry. Something about speaking to Hotaru must have upset 
her. Shocked her might be a better word for it. I could not deny that 
the behavior of my friend had hurt because it did. Not as much the 
accusation but more like fighting with her in general. Rei was a very 
temperamental person but she was also easily forgiving. She would 
never stay mad at a friend for long and if, it was only well-meant 
and at times hiding affection. The miko was a proud person, that much 
was for sure and she might not like asking for help. Help she 
obviously needed with whatever bugged her.
	Fighting with Rei hurt because we were friends, teammates and 
while it is not that we had always seen eye to eye there had been a 
trust between us from the beginning. In the Silver Millennium it was 
no different, I remembered. We had been virtually strangers to each 
other when we were assigned as Serenity&#39;s guard. However, we had 
immediately bonded. And in this life as well... And that I had to 
defend my judgment against Rei, it feel like that trust somehow 
lacked. As if she was deliberately - or maybe subconsciously - 
putting distance between us.
	Taking to the rooftops I watched her take a number of buses 
before arriving at a bigger building. I blinked at the name, sitting 
there on the low roof dumbly for a few moments, almost losing sight 
of the miko. Shaking my head I cast a last glance at the bright 
letters over the entrance and touched down to ground level, shifting 
forms with my compact mirror to easily mingle with the crowd and not 
accidentally alerting Rei to my presence.
	The name over the entrance stated clearly: &quot;Mitoki Muscial 
Studios&quot;. Very slowly things began to fall into place. This was a big 
company. One of the newer ones that had dedicated itself to finding 
young talents and ultimately make them known in the international 
area. Just being in this building meant a lot. I should know since I 
secretly dreamt of it myself. Criteria were hard though and with my 
sport activities and now Senshi business I doubted to ever have the 
time needed to succeed. How Rei had managed was a puzzle to me. A 
puzzle I intended to solve.
	Security couldn&#39;t catch a Senshi after all. About fifteen 
minutes later I had managed to perch on top of some supporter beams 
on the ceiling, carefully hidden from cameras and everyone&#39;s view. 
The downside was that I couldn&#39;t follow Rei anymore but I was more 
curious about her singing. I never knew she could and before I wanted 
to allow myself to make some kind of judgment I had to see and hear 
this first.
	The minutes ticked by, almost stretching into an hour while I 
watched two more teenage girls and a young man on stage. They were 
okay I guess but I wasn&#39;t paying much attention to them. That had 
been diverted to the raven-haired girl who entered somewhere in-
between the first two, sitting in one corner, seemingly lost in a 
mixture of deep thought and nervousness. Every so often her eyes 
scanned the room, coming dangerously close to spot my hiding place, 
before settling down again to stare into her lap.
	Great. Just what we need. She&#39;s not seriously thinking of 
going through with this NOW, is she? I sighed wistfully. Of course I 
in her situation wasn&#39;t sure if I could withstand the temptation. She 
must have had this running before she was reawakened. Something like 
that didn&#39;t just happen from one day to another and it certainly 
explained her behavior. That was still not a reason to keep this 
secret and vent your frustration on someone else. Especially if this 
someone was my girlfriend.
	My short burst of anger evaporated the moment Rei stepped 
onto the stage, facing the assembled crowd that mostly contained of 
judges and other agents. Outwardly calm and collected, her mask 
surprisingly perfect I could see the quiver in her spirit though. The 
nervousness, the torn and distracting thoughts. Rei was definitely 
uncertain how to deal with all of this which was almost alien. The 
miko always seemed to be able to manage a crisis of whatever kind 
well by herself. Yet training, fighting, school and now this. It was 
bound to take its toll on the strongest spirit.
	Then Rei began singing and I nearly fell down from the beam, 
struck by the sheer... beauty. For a moment I struggled to make a 
connection between the strong-willed, tempered girl and the soft, a 
little sad voice bearing a note of devotion and belief I was rendered 
speech- and motionless. I knew enough about singing and performance 
to understand that Rei was GOOD, really good. And an achievement no 
less was that she didn&#39;t let any of her stress influence her 
performance.
	So lost in the soft ballade pouring from my friend&#39;s lips I 
might be forgiven to not notice my senses tingle for a few moments. 
When I did it was already too late to intercept the Youma suddenly 
breaking through the ceiling only a few meters from my position. I 
swore and jumped back, calculating my fall and drawing my henshin pen.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Mamoru)
Firming my resolve I brought my motorcycle around the last corner 
into the street and helped Usagi down in front of her house. Of 
course she was very capable to do that herself but at the same time 
both of us were aware of the watchful gazes from the front door. We 
had homogenous decided to show up together even though it would be 
more custom for the invited guest to show up alone. This was supposed 
to show a joint front.
	Noting with relief that the gesture of chivalry had obviously 
been taken well by both adults I locked eyes with Usagi once before 
my jerking my head back in the direction of the house and forcing 
myself into a slow and steady pace that hopefully did not appear 
nervous. Usagi heaved an exaggerated sigh next to me and to my utter 
astonishment - judged by her own nervousness - managed to glare at 
her parents. &quot;Would you stop overdoing it? You make us feel like 
we&#39;re criminals!&quot; With a gesture she indicated at the identical 
position the two Tsukinos had had taken on opposites sides of the 
front door, appearing to all witnesses much like guards in front of a 
castle. While Usagi&#39;s mother seemed more relaxed and probably more 
curious than anything else, the suspicious glare from her husband was 
enough to nullify that relieving effect.
	Both adults had the decency to blush and Usagi&#39;s mother 
hurriedly ushered her muttering husband into the house, politely 
beckoning for us to follow. Greetings and pleasantries were exchanged 
and the tension had dropped a little. I favored Usagi with a grateful 
smile and looked around. That was practically the first time I was in 
here. Yesterday&#39;s entrance had been hurried, getting Usagi up to her 
room and very quickly retreating from Tsukino Kenji, and had left not 
much time for closer inspection. There wasn&#39;t that much to inspect 
either. That didn&#39;t mean that the inside was boring, far from it. 
Living in an apartment made you envy those that had a whole house to 
themselves all the more. I never had had much of that. Growing up as 
an orphan and very early living on my own made me long for an 
environment with a real family, a nice house, siblings maybe...
	No, Tsukino-ke wasn&#39;t boring. It was pretty much standard for 
a Japanese house harboring a four-headed family, nothing 
extraordinary spacious or decorated. It was the kind of place I would 
have wished to have grown up in. Having lost even the foggy memories 
of a six-year old in the accident I couldn&#39;t even recall what it had 
been like as a small kid. All I remembered was the orphanage and 
living alone...
	&quot;Mamo-chan!&quot; The low hiss from my girlfriend brought me back 
to reality and I blinked several times. Ikuko had stopped at the 
entrance of the living room where she had obviously prepared dinner, 
a look of worry on her face, while Kenji frowned at me. Usagi for her 
part mirrored her mother&#39;s expression threefold at least.
	&quot;Daijobu,&quot; I tried to soothe her worry. Clearing my throat I 
bowed apologetically. &quot;Gomen nasei. I was lost in thought.&quot; Thinking 
for a moment if it would be wise, I finally settled for the 
possibility of sympathy. &quot;My parents died when I was six in a car 
accident and I lost practically all of my memories.&quot; Again I had to 
clear my throat as my voice tightened with sudden thick emotion. &quot;It 
was a little overwhelming...&quot;
	A bit startled to feel Usagi&#39;s hand seeking out mine and 
giving a strong squeeze I saw that my revelations obviously had an 
instant effect on the older woman, her eyes full of compassion for a 
moment before composing herself again. &quot;It is quite already, Chiba-
san. Please come in. You two must be hungry.&quot; Usagi&#39;s father&#39;s gaze 
lasted a little bit longer on me, more thoughtful now, before he 
turned and followed his wife in. I heaved a sigh. It never did me any 
good to bring this topic up but I usually felt more detached when 
talking about it. Not so... emotional.
	Usagi smiled softly at me and tugged at my hand, for some 
reason much more relaxed now although I could swear that there had 
been traces of moisture in her left eye. Taking a few moments to 
gather my resolve once again, I felt that some of the ice had already 
been broken between Usagi&#39;s family and myself which had been the sole 
reason why I had been willing to bring that detail of my past up that 
only Usagi knew about to such a detailed degree. I wasn&#39;t quite sure 
if being an orphan would be approved or only cause for greater 
trouble but both Tsukino&#39;s didn&#39;t strike me as the type to be close-
minded. Protective, yes. But I supposed that was a trait all parents 
had in common when it came to their children. For a moment I wondered 
what my parents would have said to Usagi but quickly banished the 
thought. This was NOT an appropriate time.
	Dinner proceeded in a semi-tense silence, neither side either 
yet daring to disrupt it or not really wanting to. The two adults 
exchanged a few looks once in awhile. I would have done likewise with 
Usagi but she was too focused on her food to do so I realized with 
quiet amusement. She was NOT using her normal eating speed, trying 
her best to not fall back in old habits. While the blonde girl had 
really made a jump in manners and the training from Priapos began to 
show in her body language and increased balance it was apparently 
impossible to totally cure Tsukino Usagi of wolfing her food down in 
giant heaps. It might be incredulous to admit but I was glad about 
that. There were just some things about the innocent, carefree Usagi 
that were not right to be changed.
	And honestly, one could not blame her the still above average 
speed with which she digested her mother&#39;s quite delicate food. &quot;This 
really tastes good, Tsukino-san,&quot; I commented in an attempt to break 
the silence which became a little uncomfortable.
	The other woman hid a slight blush and smiled in 
acknowledgment of the compliment. &quot;Well, one has to keep those three 
fed. I swear you can&#39;t let either one of them in a kitchen.&quot;
	Usagi laughed at that and scratched her head in 
embarrassment. &quot;It has to come from &#39;tousan&#39;s family side.&quot; The elder 
Tsukino just grumbled at the comment to which we all laughed, even 
Kenji joining in after awhile.
	Tension lifted the rest of the dinner proceeded in small 
talk, occasional question about my studies interspersed in-between. 
Those, however, stayed on the surface for quite awhile, everyone now 
enjoying the pleasant conversation. For a few minutes it seemed as if 
we were just a normal family enjoying dinner. The feeling was warming 
and as I caught Ikuko&#39;s warm smile in my direction after awhile I 
wondered if it was intentional. Usagi&#39;s mother definitely made clear 
from which&#39;s side of the family Usagi&#39;s easygoing and compassionate 
attitude came and let me wonder how much actually was a reborn 
personality from the Silver Millennium and how much came from the 
Tsukinos.
	Kenji for his part was mostly silent, only adding a comment 
here or there. That made me uneasy for some reason because I was 
expecting the serious, pointed question at any moment. I squirmed a 
little under the intense look that was neither hostile nor friendly. 
His expression was hard to read and it appeared that the man was deep 
in thought, something that after Usagi&#39;s descriptions and the 
encounter from yesterday night I wasn&#39;t sure whether to be glad or 
worried about.

	HATE.

	My.
	&quot;POWER!&quot;

	&quot;MAKE UP!&quot;
	Analytically seen it was truly amazing how quick a whole crew 
of several dozen people of a wide spectrum of ages could manage to 
clear a big hall within seconds the moment a giant salamander-like 
Youma and just after it a mad flurry of golden beams, not only 
masking wielder and Youma but me as well, dropped onto the stage. I 
didn&#39;t even want to ask why Minako was here. I really, REALLY didn&#39;t 
want to ask.
	Things had gone so well after that encounter with Tomoe 
Hotaru, her last words still spooking in my mind all through the 
audition. Somehow I had managed to cast those thoughts aside and 
loose myself in the music, channeling the emotions into the words and 
my voice. In a way the most important part of today had been much 
less stressing than the rest.
	And that fucked up Youma had the audacity to interrupt MY 
moment which I had worked months for? Which I had devoted most of my 
free time to. Which I had took the risk of alienating a friend? Which 
I HAD unleashed the strain of the constant pressure of my life on a 
maybe slightly suspicious but still rather innocent-seeming girl for? 
Just if you couldn&#39;t tell, I was ANGRY. Furious actually and not even 
that began to really describe it.
	Taking a deep breath I tried to clear my mind and focus my 
rage on the enemy effectively instead of blindly while Venus landed 
next to me. It wasn&#39;t really working. &quot;Ugly thing,&quot; the blonde Senshi 
of Love commented dryly, casting me a glance that could mean a lot of 
things. A lot of things I really didn&#39;t have either the time or 
patience now to figure out. The Youma wasn&#39;t really fazed from the 
initial assault. Not really a miracle since the giant salamander that 
reached almost under the ceiling standing on its hint legs was 
completely coated in fire. Red and oranges flames were crackling 
around its body which would make an elemental attack practically 
useless. I was to angry to care.
	&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot; As expected the fireball was sucked in almost 
instantly by the fiery armor and we had to jump clear as the Youma 
lunged for us. &quot;Kuso,&quot; I cursed. Parts of the interior of the hall 
were already beginning to catch fire.
	&quot;That is SO not good,&quot; Venus mumbled trying it with her Wink-
Chain Sword but only eliciting a similar reaction. We looked at each 
other a little helplessly and it wasn&#39;t helping that my mind was 
partially clouded with a red haze that made any kind of logical 
thinking impossible. I didn&#39;t listen to Venus&#39; shouts and jumping 
clear of fire breath and lunges from the Youma I continued to bombard 
the thing with fireballs and mandalas to no avail other than the 
purpose of venting my anger.
	It came as it had to come and so lost in my own rage I 
completely missed a move Priapos would have thrown me off a cliff for 
missing. When the lashing tail smashed into me my vision blurred and 
turned black for a few moments. As I came back to my senses a searing 
pain and the smell of burned flesh had an unpleasant but also an 
oddly clearing effect on me. It helped to clear my mind. I couldn&#39;t 
allow myself to lose my cool. We were elemental-mismatched and from 
what I could see Venus wasn&#39;t really keen on going into close combat 
with that thing. If we just had a way to stun it for a few moments to 
make a new plan...
	A vision flared in front of my eyes. Memories of a long 
passed life. Foremost though, knowledge. Sometimes it really was an 
annoying trait. That those memory flashes always happened in the heat 
of battle. However, at the same time it had often saved our 
collective butts more than once. We never really talked about it but 
often a maneuver or reaction would just happen instinctively because 
it reminded our Senshi personalities of a similar situation in our 
former lives.
	&quot;MARS...&quot;
	Twirling into a spiral much like Venus did with her chain I 
managed to clear my mind under the cleansing holy flames surrounding 
me briefly.
	&quot;SNAKE FIRE!&quot;

(Usagi)
Dinner was more or less finished, right now all of us were only 
picking at the remains in an attempt to prolong getting to the 
serious topic, or so it seemed at least. I was glad that the tension 
had lifted a little but it had been replaced by reluctance which 
created a totally new kind of tension... Okaasan was obviously trying 
to be pleasant but she kept exchanging looks with Otousan who I had 
no idea what he was thinking about. The fact that he was thinking was 
probably the most disturbing thing. Not that &#39;tousan wasn&#39;t 
intelligent, he simply tended to overreaction and overprotection when 
it came to me and Shingo. I hadn&#39;t expected him to be that 
thoughtful... and silent.
	Maybe he was still thinking about Mamoru&#39;s revelation from 
earlier. I had heard that story once and it had pained me. I had felt 
terrible that moment in the elevator to Starlight Tower. Terrible and 
vulnerable because I had always thought him to be stuck-up and 
arrogant. Then Mamoru related his parents&#39; death to me. To ME of all 
people. That was when I realized that even if we might clash in a few 
areas that Mamoru just tried to lead a normal life despite his past 
and orphan status and that in a way we were pretty similar. Ever 
since becoming Sailormoon my life had been different and all 
throughout that first year I had carried the wish within myself to 
just return to the normal life as a mere schoolgirl and a normal 
family...
	I shook my head to clear the memory of that event. All in all 
I believe it was a big step for Mamoru to speak about his deceased 
and forgotten family. It had shown. To me in that elevator and before 
dinner tonight. There was no way my parents would have missed it. I 
looked up at the clock reading a little past five that it was a 
pretty early dinner at this...
	The silence had become almost touchable for awhile now and 
therefore I actually jumped a little as the mostly silent person, 
namely my &#39;tousan, suddenly spoke up. &quot;So, you are studying here at 
Azabu University, Chiba-san?&quot; It was a casual question as most were 
before but also a little more personal.
	Mamoru was obviously startled as well at the question and 
needed a few seconds to reply, swallowing some of his food. &quot;Ah... 
Hai. I&#39;m studying medicine and a little journalism.&quot; An... odd 
combination. I knew about the medicine part but that my boyfriend was 
apparently in journalism wasn&#39;t that surprising I had seen him work 
on some things now and then the last days but always assumed it was 
just for one of the side jobs he kept to finance his studies.
	Otousan raised an eyebrow and you could see a certain 
interest sparkling behind his glasses. &quot;Really? How... interesting. 
Have you ever done any photography?&quot; Of course he would ask that. 
That was after all Otousan&#39;s job and he was good at that. I watched 
him and Mamoru with some amusement and not a small amount of relief 
beginning to chat more familiar and excited in a matter of minutes. 
While Mamoru apparently hadn&#39;t done much in the area of photography 
he showed a genuine interest in Kenji&#39;s description of his work which 
was likewise returned when my boyfriend began to talk about the 
differences about the university today compared to my &#39;tousan&#39;s days. 
I glanced over at Okaasan and saw her winking at me which brought a 
soft smile to my lips. Luna who had been silently perched atop my 
right shoulder throughout dinner made a small sighing noise. 
Realizing that I had almost forgotten about her presence which WAS 
helping I scratched her under the chin much to the cat&#39;s delight.
	Of course that relative peace wasn&#39;t supposed to last long. I 
should have known better than Otousan just dropping the issue of last 
night like that. Yet I had lost myself in the hope that everything 
would work out, now that the two men had found some common thing to 
talk about. Therefore it took me - and Mamoru too - off guard as 
Kenji&#39;s expression became serious once more in a slight talking pause 
and he leveled a piercing stare at both of us. &quot;Now. I can see that 
Chiba-san obviously is a really nice guy and normally I would even 
approve, demo...&quot; Both of us swallowed a little, knowing exactly what 
was coming.
	Okaasan intervened at this point, taking over for her husband 
in one fluent motion. &quot;Look we don&#39;t want to be judgmental but what 
Kenji is saying we still have no real idea what exactly you two were 
doing out so late, not to mention that you were pretty exhausted 
Usagi. Of course we would be worried about you.&quot; Otousan was about to 
add his own comment but thought better of it after a chastening look 
from his wife.
	&quot;Well we...&quot; I started, trying to take some pressure from 
Mamoru but he cut me off with a gesture.
	Taking a deep breath he made a point in fixing Kenji with his 
eyes while answering, &quot;I was merely bringing your daughter home from 
an exhausting night of studying and training with her friends, 
Tsukino-san.&quot; There was a flicker of... something. I couldn&#39;t 
pinpoint it but it reminded me of that aspect of royalty in me 
whenever Serenity had emerged. It was a silent but convincing 
determination. Okaasan blinked a little at the manner of answer 
but &#39;tousan held Mamoru&#39;s gaze for a few moments before nodding 
slowly.
	&quot;I... see. What kind of training are we speaking about here?&quot; 
A few drops of sweat promptly formed on my forehead, trying to think 
up something to cover my boyfriend&#39;s little slip...
	&quot;A friend of the girls decided to give them some basic 
Martial Arts training.&quot; Or not. I gaped silently at Mamoru, making 
small gagging noises, not quite believing what I heard. What the hell 
is he doing, I wanted to hiss that last thought at him but feared 
that would only make it worse. Luna for her part let out a startled 
mewing. It became apparent that my decision to remain silent was a 
good thing because Mamoru proved to have everything under control. At 
Okaasan&#39;s troubled and a little shocked expression and Otousan&#39;s 
narrowed gaze he actually managed to look and sound convincing. &quot;I 
mean, you know. With all those monsters lately running around 
wouldn&#39;t you be more relieved to know your daughter is able to 
protect herself if necessary? And I know some Martial Arts too and 
can tell you Erubia-san is very good.&quot;
	THAT reasoning effectively stunned the whole table until I 
noticed with some growing dread that my communicator that I had 
switched to silent had been trying to relate me an emergency call for 
the last twenty minutes... Both Luna and I sweatdropped, not to 
mention were a little worried about the others.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Artemis)
It hadn&#39;t been a problem to follow Minako... Well, actually I had 
been following Hotaru and with that probably acting on the same 
instinct that had Minako prompted to do the same thing. I wasn&#39;t sure 
if she had spotted me yet but suspected it highly. We were so used to 
each other that the other always knew instinctively than the other 
was around. Witnessing the scene unfold below that became a mood 
point anyway.
	With a hissing roar the flames shot from Mars&#39; open palms 
forward to encircle the giant salamander like a vivid piece of rope. 
The attack didn&#39;t have its name for nothing because in less than a 
few seconds the magical flames had effectively bound the Youma in 
place. The beast wasn&#39;t able to absorb the alien magic even though it 
was of its own element and therefore Mars&#39; superior fire wasn&#39;t able 
to control it either but to hold it immobile.
	Not for long though, I noted with a worried look at Mars who 
was struggling to control the trashing beast within her fire. Venus 
was hesitant, not daring to go into close combat with the fiery 
protection of the opponent and unsure if she wouldn&#39;t just succeed in 
cutting it loose with a more powerful elemental attack. In short the 
two Senshi were clueless what to do with that temporary stalemate. 
Not to mention that the building really was beginning to crumble 
under the hissing inferno inside.
	I jumped down next to Venus but kept my distance. The heat 
radiating from the fire salamander was bad enough, the entire hall 
was already feeling like on a hot midsummer day. At my charge&#39;s kind 
of helpless look I could only shake my head I was thinking hard for a 
solution to that dilemma but came up empty. We were elemental-wise 
outmatched and the fire armor made that thing too dangerous to engage 
in close combat.
	&quot;I can&#39;t hold it much longer,&quot; Mars called out through 
gritted teeth trying to virtually wrestle down the strange beast with 
sheer mental strength. A task that was as impossible as it was 
foolish at this state of her training. A fully-trained Mars in her 
prime could tame such a beast but Rei was far from her prime... The 
hissing sound of energy alerted me to the fact that Venus had 
activated the Venus Tear in blade mode, no doubt planning on some 
hara-kiri strike as long as it was possible. Fortunately that became 
unnecessary.
	&quot;SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!&quot;
	&quot;SUPREME THUNDER DRAGON!&quot;
	A chorus of voices rang out through the hall, accompanied by 
a sudden torrent of water slamming into the unsuspecting salamander. 
Mars had the presence of mind to pull back her binding flames at the 
last possible moment so that the beast had to take the full force of 
the antagonizing and opposing element of its own. Just a second later 
a mighty electrical current in the shape of a large dragon raced 
along the steady stream of incoming water. The fire salamander let 
loose with a terrifying and bone-chilling screech as its flames were 
quelled and thousands of volt raced along every inch of its body.
	Venus, being the leader and superior fighter she had become 
in the last months, reacted immediately as the attacks began to 
cease, vaulting into the air, she called upon a shower of beams that 
cut through the beast with the force of a gale storm, practically 
cutting it to pieces. A few seconds of that onslaught were enough and 
in a burst of flames its existence was ended completely.
	&quot;Phew... Arigato, minna. That was just on time,&quot; Venus 
remarked with a truly thankful look at Mercury and Jupiter, Mars 
agreed with a nod but one could see that she was quite angry at the 
interruption and believe me after seeing - and hearing - what I did I 
could very well understand it. I wouldn&#39;t go all Luna on you and 
complain about the unfairness that the girls couldn&#39;t have a social 
life... No, I had other ways to relieve my emotions. None of which 
would be entertained anytime soon, unfortunately...
	The two new arrivals barely had moved closer or had the time 
to respond when a voice made us all look upwards. &quot;Impressive. You 
have slain my pet. But I hadn&#39;t expected any less of the famous 
Sailorsenshi.&quot; The being the deep male voice belonged to was perched 
atop one of the supporter beams under the ceiling standing in plain 
view unlike Minako earlier. Clad in obsidian black armor one with 
less attuned and sharpened senses could have missed him - or maybe 
better it - with ease. It was the very vision of a heavy-clad, 
armored and armed warrior. Like a knight of the middle ages. Through 
the visor in his helmet glowed a spooky crimson-purple light. It - 
the thing itself, not the light alone - made the hairs on my neck 
stand on end. There was an immense and potent feeling of recognition 
but I couldn&#39;t pinpoint it. And there was also the same feeling of 
immediate danger...
	Mars ever the tempered girl and at the moment devoid any 
patience at all, only seeing the thing as the main source for the 
interruption of her singing reacted as expected. &quot;Yeah, just as we 
will slay you! FIRE...&quot;
	&quot;Mars, NO!&quot;
	&quot;...SOUL!&quot; Jupiter&#39;s shout was too late and ignored anyway. 
The fireball soared through the air hitting its target dead-on. The 
black knight hadn&#39;t even moved. My eyes narrowed first and then 
widened as the holy flames were practically sucked right into the 
creature and, before anyone could react, returned in a burst of the 
same colored light emitting from inside its helmet. Instincts alone 
let anyone hit the floor or jump clear at the last moment.
	&quot;What the...?&quot; exclaimed Mars shifting to a more guarded 
position. &quot;What is that thing?&quot; It was almost touchable now. I tried 
to force the memory from the depths of my mind and once again cursed 
the effects hibernation had on both Luna and my minds.
	Before I could come up with a result, Jupiter already beat me 
to it, announcing with a low hiss two words that sent a chill right 
through my whole body. &quot;Aura Knight.&quot;
	Kuso! How could I have not remembered? It was so obvious and 
it made oh so much sense. Aura Knights loved to hold elemental 
creatures like the fire salamander - a Flamemander native to Mars&#39; 
actually - for what they called pets. It wasn&#39;t that Aura Knights 
were usually evil but they had a ruthless reputation even in the 
Silver Millennium. And they were about as dangerous as a minion could 
get.
	&quot;Aura Knight?&quot; Mercury asked puzzled, trying to call up data 
on her computer in a frantic pace. Venus had this dawning look on her 
face that told me that Hebe was just relaying her own memories which 
meant she had a good idea exactly how dangerous those knights were. I 
sent a curious glance in Jupiter&#39;s directions also, impressed that 
she had recognized it so quickly but considering that Aura Knights 
had had their home on Jupiter it wasn&#39;t all that surprising.
	&quot;Nasty guys. They can absorb any and all kind of magic to a 
very high quantity and quality,&quot; Jupiter explained and Venus nodded, 
falling into a ready stance with her blade kept close. The Aura 
Knight had not moved or spoken ever since its entrance but from 
experience I knew that could change from one moment to another and it 
would be all over us.
	&quot;So... We can still take it in close combat?&quot; Mars asked, 
trying to sound certain but actually only managed to slightly 
suppress the hopeful tone.
	I shook my head with a wary look at the unmoving 
figure. &quot;That&#39;s the problem. They are probably the toughest guys in 
close combat, whether with a weapon or unarmed, this side of the 
galaxy knows...&quot;
	It was at that moment the Aura Knight decided to move and any 
further explanation was cut short.

(Priapos)
Up to this point I had no conscious idea why the hell I was here. Not 
to mention why I was here sitting across from the other redhead - 
well, it was more auburn-colored hair actually - and sipping on the 
terran drink called tea... I simply had no idea and elves by nature 
were an inexhaustible fountain of curiosity that just could not leave 
an intriguing mystery unsolved.
	&quot;So,&quot; I said into the silence, taking one more sip and 
setting the cup down. My, aren&#39;t we dramatic today? &quot;Here we are... 
again. What an interesting coincidence.&quot; The &quot;here&quot; in question was 
the Crown Fruit Parlor - and yes, they did serve tea if you wished 
for it - which after a brief tour through the shopping district we 
had found ourselves returning to. It was really a bit strange. First 
it had only been the &quot;oh, I&#39;m heading in the same direction&quot; excuse. 
And an excuse I was. I wasn&#39;t dumb and lying to an elf was... nearly 
impossible. I had not said a thing. I mean, why? After all the 
purpose of today&#39;s stroll for the day was to actually relax for a 
bit. The morning had been eventless and there was no reason why to 
not enjoy a battle-free day for once. Nobody knew how long it had 
been that I had had time to relax. I mean really relax.
	The truth of the matter was I probably didn&#39;t let myself 
relax. Ever since coming into this time I had constantly been doing 
something. Train with my sister, scout, train with the others, 
intervene in a battle with the newest Youma... The reason for that? 
No particular one. Maybe - just maybe - I still felt a little guilty 
for my involvement in Hotaru&#39;s capture in England. Just a tiny bit.
	However, I had found the company of Osaka Naru... refreshing. 
Interacting with someone other than the Senshi or the Court, being 
around normal people, I didn&#39;t know that anymore since I was little 
and young Venus had taken me in. Ever since then I only knew life at 
the palace or in a battle zone. With allies, enemies and the only 
family I ever had. Venus, now Minako, and probably Hotaru as well 
now. Talking with Naru was strangely refreshing and there hadn&#39;t been 
anything significant mentioned, just small talk between two girls. 
Never mind the fact that one was just a mere human girl from Chikyuu 
and the other an elf from Venus in disguise. No, if anything the elf 
was even more smitten by the girl&#39;s charm.
	Would you stop that now? This sounds so cheesy, I chided 
myself mentally, suppressing a wry grin. There was no denying it 
though that Osaka Naru was a person you could easily open up to. She 
was kind and the sort of friend that would be there the moment you 
needed her, whether you asked for it or not. I had always been good 
in reading people. Okay, maybe not fantastic but adequately enough 
and from the brief hour we had spent raiding the mall for some much 
needed clothes - after all my glamour image should look presentable - 
I had gotten a good impression from the girl. Safely to say was that 
I could easily understand why she was the Princess&#39; best friend. At 
the same time I noticed a certain... wrongness in her behavior. I had 
seen Naru once or twice before and knew she was usually a quiet type. 
Not like Ami or Hotaru but... just quiet. Today it seemed that she 
had a lot of her mind and I felt more than once the occasional stare 
behind my back or side glance.
	Naru giggled a little after mimicking the dramatic scene of 
putting down my cup of tea like in one of the movies and I felt 
myself smiling in good-natured humor. Then her expression become 
serious again, much more serious than before and I braced myself for 
some serious denial speech... whatever it was I had to deny. Osaka 
Naru was a sharp girl. That was one character trait I had identified 
right away and one thing why I had been extra cautious not to do 
anything inhuman-like. The words though that came from the ordinary 
and unsuspecting looking girl&#39;s lips rendered me speechless for a few 
moments. &quot;I don&#39;t even know exactly why I&#39;m talking to you but I need 
someone to talk to right now and Usagi is so busy lately with school 
and fighting those monsters and all...&quot;
	My eyebrows surely disappeared under the hairline as I stared 
at her disbelievingly. She had not just said that sentence so 
casually, didn&#39;t she? I mean, Naru had phrased it as if there was no 
doubt about it, not to mention a big thing to do so just like that... 
What the heck? &quot;Matte!&quot; I exclaimed in a sharp whisper. &quot;What... How 
can you be...?&quot; The words were failing me and I had always thought 
myself to be good with words, raised in a palace, together with a 
princess as my kin sister and all that.
	&quot;How I can be so sure? I don&#39;t really know how I know, I just 
do. But I don&#39;t want to worry Usagi with that. She&#39;d just be fussing 
about it, maybe I talk to her when it&#39;s a bit quieter.&quot; And with a 
grin she added, &quot;And your wings are showing.&quot; I blinked, checking my 
glamour immediately but finding it still in place. Glancing back at 
Naru bewildered I wasn&#39;t sure what to say. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. Maybe 
it&#39;s just that whole &#39;pure heart&#39; thing, who knows?&quot; She wriggled her 
eyebrows, giggling slightly.
	&quot;Nah,&quot; I replied, finally finding my voice back. &quot;That only 
applies to unicorns and sometimes fairies. An elf glamour is based 
more on a pheromone that influences the senses of those around them, 
suggesting to them they are only seeing an ordinary human... or 
whatever human-like race is wished at the moment.&quot; Why the hell was I 
telling her that? On the other hand denying would sound rather lame 
right now, wouldn&#39;t it. &quot;Some people can see through it, maybe that&#39;s 
the case. Usual my second layer should take care of that though.&quot;
	Naru had listened fairly interested and not the least bit 
freaked out or stupefied at the information. Not that that was 
surprising since she had figured it out on her own. I still wasn&#39;t 
sure how she did it but found it rather insignificant right now. 
There was no real danger from the auburn-haired girl. After all I had 
already determined that Naru was a trustworthy girl and the fact that 
she didn&#39;t tell Usagi because of the obvious stress the Princess was 
in was only underlining that.
	Shrugging my shoulders and deciding to dwell on that 
startling bit of revelation later I regarded Naru with a curious 
look. &quot;So, what exactly did you want to talk about? It&#39;s not about... 
that thing I assume?&quot; She shook her head and I sighed in relief, not 
really fond of the idea to talk about anything concerning Senshi 
business without permission of the others. Also I felt like I was 
back in control again and that was an added bonus. Having enough 
experience with providing advice to the hard to handle Hebe I felt 
fairly confident helping the girl with whatever problem she had that 
was bothering her.
	Unfortunately fate decided to show its face once again right 
the moment Naru prepared to speak with a slight explosion followed by 
a minor tremble. Both of us reflexively looked in the direction a 
faint pillar of smoke was rising. I wasn&#39;t sure if the smoke was even 
visible to the other girl since she didn&#39;t posses my finely attuned 
senses so I pointed in the specific direction, a rising dread 
beginning to fill my insides all of a sudden. &quot;Say. Isn&#39;t that 
Usagi&#39;s neighborhood?&quot;
	The worry in Naru&#39;s face was more of an answer than I needed 
and I let loose with an unrestrained curse and was already halfway 
out of the door when Naru&#39;s soft voice stopped me.
	&quot;Be careful.&quot;
	Hesitating for a split second I looked back at her and nodded 
firmly. A few seconds later I had already slipped into the alley near 
the caf&eacute;, dropped my glamour and was airborne.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Usagi)
Talk had graciously been directed to more mundane topics and Mamoru, 
Luna and I all heaved internal sighs of relief that the situation had 
obviously been successfully averted. By my boyfriend&#39;s clever 
maneuvering no less. Otousan had asked a few questions, since he had 
taken some Martial Arts classes in his youth as well, and Okaasan of 
course voiced a bit of worry. But assurance from my part that I 
really liked - I had to force myself to say it believingly though - 
the training and a short demonstration put most of their fears to 
rest. It had just been basic things that with my Senshi constitution 
I could have done a few days after becoming Sailormoon but now it 
came more natural, more fluent. Something I really was thankful for.
	All the time we had tried to come with a reason to cut the 
conversation short - since dinner was already finished - but we 
didn&#39;t want to appear rude either. It wasn&#39;t like the other Senshi 
needed me for every battle. Venus alone had progressed to a level 
where - in combination with the Tear - she could easily turn the tide 
in a battle to their side. However, there was no proof that there 
wouldn&#39;t be a repeat of our first battle, missing that could be 
lethal. I exchanged a look with Luna and then with Mamoru who 
probably thought the same. The fact that the communicator was still 
sending a silent signal meant that the battle was still most likely 
underway. The other option I didn&#39;t even want to consider and was 
sure the psychic bond between us would have told me if anything 
gravely had happened. I shuddered slightly, remembering how I felt 
the death of every one of them at D-Point. It had been enough to send 
me into a shocked state until their spirits had brought me out of it.
	Whatever excuse for a quick leave Mamoru had prepared he only 
managed to open his mouth before there was a loud crash from the 
direction of the front door. We had no time to move as a moment later 
a menacing looking figure strode into the living room brandishing 
obsidian-black armor and a deadly-looking sword at its side. The 
eerie light that poured out from under its helmet was unsettling, 
telling at least three present in the rooms that the thing was 
definitely not human or at least not from this world.
	&#39;kaasan shrieked and Luna gave a yelp as both Mamoru and I 
immediately jumped up. The knight seemed to stand there in the middle 
of the room for a moment sweeping its gaze over the occupants and 
remaining on me... well, Mamoru and me. Slowly it drew the blade at 
his side - sporting not only sharp and gleaming steel in deep purple 
but also a crackling energy corona of midnight-blackness - and 
pointed it at us. The meaning was clear to EVERYONE present.
	Everything happened so quickly. Otousan had obviously sensed 
that any reasoning with our adversary would be futile and being the 
protective father he was grabbed a knife and jumped in front of the 
table trying to look menacing... A hard task considering the 
difference in armor and weaponry. &quot;Don&#39;t come closer!&quot; he shouted but 
the knight would have none of it. In a motion that seemed as if he 
was merely flexing his arms he lashed out with his sword in a casual 
swing sending &#39;tousan flying. When he smashed and slumped against the 
wall you could see that not only his clothes were ripped open but 
there was also a sickening gash on his chest that I could not 
immediately determine how fatal it was. Okaasan let go of another 
scream and hands held before her mouth she stumbled back in shock. 
Mamoru and I were sort of rooted to the ground by the ruthlessness 
and suddenness of the intrusion. Thousands of thoughts were rushing 
through my head but my body refused to move.
	I felt myself being pushed to the ground and reflexes, fine-
tuned through my training, let me automatically roll with the fall. 
The sizzling blade passed only centimeters over Mamoru and me. I had 
no time to even flash a thankful smile as battle instincts took 
control and for the first time I was really thankful for Priapos 
training drill. I was sure otherwise I would have not been able to 
avoid the follow-up strike from the knight. Jumping clear from the 
downward strike I whirled around immediately and once again could 
only watch in horror as the knight seemingly indifferent continued to 
let his momentum carry him, directly towards a frightened Ikuko who 
stared wide-eyed and unmoving at the advancing figure. My hand flew 
to my brooch but I knew it would be too late.
	Iie! Okaasan! The mental scream echoed and vibrated over and 
over again in my head.
	A hiss and a purely inhuman cry cut through the air and the 
knight stopped, grunting more in annoyance then hurt. Luna had 
attached herself at the face... well, helmet of the knight and was 
scratching away at the material to only small success. The knight 
reached up and flung Luna across the room where she slumped against 
the wall next to a barely conscious Kenji.
	The brutally was sickening to the core and slowly the shock 
began to be overridden by something else. I was reminded of the trip 
to the hot springs in my first year as a Senshi. A misguided ghost 
raised by Endymion had attacked us then and I had nearly been forced 
to transform in front of my family&#39;s eyes. Now it was different 
though. That wasn&#39;t a confused and out-of-control ghost, this was a 
methodical, ruthless assailant. That much was clear. And it was here 
because of me. My family was in danger because of me. I... I... I 
could not allow that to continue. I had to do something, consequences 
be damned.
	&quot;Moon...&quot; I whispered clutching my brooch and locking eyes 
briefly with Mamoru who was just coming to his feet again taking a 
minor hit in the attempt to strike at the knight physically. He 
nodded grimly at me, reaching under his jacket for one of his roses. 
Time for secrets had run out and only surviving and the safety of my 
parents counted right now. There was a distinct possibility that in 
their barely conscious state they would chalk it up to the stress or 
something after all. That could be dealt with later. &quot;Crystal...&quot;
	However, much like last time - which was distinctively ironic 
I tell you - it was just that moment that the necessary diversion was 
being made. A crackling sound of released energy was all that 
announced the chi beam that struck the knight in the back sending it 
stumbling. Amazingly enough it managed to whirl around and parry the 
glowing energy blade of one very pissed elf. The two struggled for 
dominance for awhile before Priapos jumped clear and took a ready 
stance. I noticed that she had left open a path that would allow both 
Mamoru and me to get outside, yet there was no way we could take my 
parents with us. The fact that Otousan just about now had passed out 
and Okaasan fainted from the sensual overload made all of this a mood 
point though.
	I clenched my teeth and finished the transformation 
phrase. &quot;MAKE UP!&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Mercury)
I barely had time to stow the Mercury Computer back into subspace 
when the devastating fighting machine arrived in our midst. All of us 
had to jump clear of one wild but disturbingly accurate swing that 
could have cut our heads off at once. I hadn&#39;t been able to find any 
info in the archives about this so-called Aura Knight but the 
reactions from those who obviously knew those guys was disconcerting 
enough. From what I could analyze of the barrier that absorbed any 
form of magic I could tell that anything short of the Ginzuishou&#39;s 
power unleashed would do no good at all. And since there had been no 
reply from Usagi ever since Venus sent out the distress call it was 
certain that they wouldn&#39;t get away from her parents in time.
	&quot;We need to get out of here! Mercury, cover!&quot; Venus called 
out and I complied immediately, knowing that the hall might be big 
enough to give us space but the damage it had taken from the knight&#39;s 
pet was already enough and could easily bring it down. The fog filled 
the hall at my command but was already beginning to be sucked away by 
the knight&#39;s barrier. &quot;Move, minna!&quot; Venus urged us on and we were 
only happy to comply with that. Outside might give us some room to 
maneuver better, hopefully there wouldn&#39;t be a crowd around the 
building already but the people around here had learned already that 
staying in the near vicinity of a battle between Senshi and Youma or 
anything that might seem like one was not supportive for one&#39;s health.
	And so it was that the usual busy streets in front of the 
building were practically empty of any traffic or passer-byes by the 
time we emerged out of the entrance our adversary hot on our tail. 
Falling into an arrow-like formation with me in the back, Venus in 
the front and Jupiter and Mars at the flanks we faced off with the 
Aura Knight but it was  easy to see the wariness and uncertainty 
about a course of action in that situation.
	I stayed behind as Venus finally lead a charge from three 
directions with a fierce battle cry and took out my mini computer 
again, knowing very well that I would only be a hindrance in this 
fight. It didn&#39;t bother me very much. I never was much of a physical 
fighter, even in the Silver Millennium as much as I remembered. We 
were a team and they trusted me to come up with a strategy, a 
weakness or any other possible advantage that could help my friend to 
turn the tide.
	There really wasn&#39;t much though. The first minute already 
demonstrated why - according to the data I had by then pulled up - 
the Aura Knights were or had been the most fearful fighters this side 
of the galaxy. Trained from a near-infant stage their bodies were 
honed for combat, their armor and weapons forged by the best 
materials and master smiths and their nearly immune status to any 
form of regular combat magic made them a foe one would rather like to 
avoid if possible in any way. Unfortunately that option wasn&#39;t 
available for us anymore. They were known as assailants and that was 
pretty much obviously its task here.
	Venus had tried to practically hack through its defenses with 
a downward slash devastating to probably any other opponent. The Aura 
Knight, however, caught the sizzling, cross-like blades of the Venus 
Tear with his own dark one. It took a hard punch from Jupiter in the 
process but managed to catch Mars&#39; kick and fling her with one arm at 
her teammate. Venus managed to press her advantage under the 
diversion for several more seconds before she had to fall back and 
duck under a wide swing. The knight had the advantage in reach and it 
was almost insanely fast even with that armor so that Venus&#39; usual 
superior agility and speed wasn&#39;t helping to outweigh the imbalance 
enough.
	Mars, furious at her earlier treatment, sailed in with a chi-
charged ofuda but the paper was easily cut and Mars, definitely 
surprised at the sheer speed of the reaction, earned herself a severe 
wound in her right shoulder as she crashed into the pavement only a 
few feet away from me. That served to momentarily distract Venus 
enough to leave her guard open for a fatal moment. I was about to cry 
out a warning but realized it would be too late. Not to mention it 
turned out to be unnecessary.
	There was a disturbing sound, a mixture between a hiss and a 
deep growl that was altogether inhuman - and not even cat-like - as 
Artemis suddenly leaped towards the combatants. I watched in stunned 
amazement as his eyes were glowing a furious red all of a sudden and 
his small form was bathed in a multi-colored flash of light, 
stretching, reforming and increasing speed with every passing moment, 
becoming a human... err, animal missile in the process. By the time 
Artemis passed Venus and slammed into the Aura Knight he resembled 
more a white tiger or a leopard maybe. Bouncing back from his assault 
that actually managed to stun the knight for a moment, his body 
shifted once again, becoming more human-like but not quite getting 
there. White hair, an athletic built and more than adequate height 
were coupled by a protective white fur at several vital parts of his 
body, a lashing tail and claw-tipped hands.
	&quot;Nani?&quot; I managed totally baffled and Mars next to me lifted 
her pain-stricken face in equal wonderment. Artemis exchanged a look 
with Venus that seemed meaningless to any other person but for those 
two probably was all the explanation really needed. They nodded to 
each other and turned in tandem towards the Aura Knight, Jupiter 
joining them a second later.
	Awesome, I thought. Shape-shifting. I never knew he and Luna 
could do that... Hopefully this could give us the needed edge because 
as far as tactics were concerned I was sadly clueless this time. 
Those knights were so perfect there wasn&#39;t much to work with. A 
stream of data had informed me about a gemstone-like device that was 
obviously the source of the magical absorber but first it was located 
in the neck of the knight, a tiny spot that would be nearly 
impossible to destroy, and second I was sure Venus and Jupiter were 
aware of that already.
	Now we could only hope to somehow overpower it.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Priapos)
So much for a quiet, relaxing day, I thought to myself. It was to 
good to be true anyway. Ever since this first massive attack the 
Senshi had been kept on their toes constantly. Why should it be 
different today? Of course, it wouldn&#39;t, I mused and deflected a 
swing that spoke clearly of the superior power of the opponent I was 
currently facing.
	Aura Knights. Nasty things they were. I had fought three in 
my whole life. Two on Mercury investigating an incident between 
locals and supposedly a Venusian elf and one on Magellan, Venus&#39; by 
now lost moon, already during the start of the conflict between Earth 
and the Moon. The memories of these encounters were not actually what 
you would call fond ones and during those three encounters I had 
dealt with knights of only an average level. This one here was 
clearly a fully-trained, high-class Aura Knight. That could get ugly. 
I was really glad though that I came here as quickly as I could. A 
moment later could have been a devastating blow.
	Struggling against the superhuman strength I reversed the 
grip on my energy blade slightly in a way that allowed me to slip 
underneath my opponent&#39;s and come up clear behind it. Having already 
turned in mid-motion I released a chi blast into the back of the 
heavy armor, restraining myself not to put out any magic. That would 
only have the opposite effect. Sadly I must admit that while I was a 
credible master in both the fields of chi control as well as magic my 
actual chi capacities lacked in that regard. Well, not really the 
capacities but it was more the limited access provided by my strong 
bonds as a nature elf to the very essence of life itself. In short, 
it was rather draining and maintaining one or two blades often was 
all I could manage in actual combat without running the risk of 
powering myself out.
	Therefore the actual result of the attack was quite 
disappointing and I barely managed to avert the counter delivered 
with striking accuracy and not one trace of distracting anger. In the 
blink of an eye I had formed a second blade catching my opponent&#39;s 
black one again and staring defiantly into the disconcerting light 
emitting from deep within. Nobody really knew how Aura Knights really 
looked underneath there armor but it was rather clear that they 
weren&#39;t human.
	&quot;Traitor,&quot; a deep male voice hissed suddenly, making me pause 
for a crucial moment. I twisted my body to the side and grit my teeth 
as the obsidian blade caught me in the side. It burned but I refused 
to acknowledge the pain. Over a decade worth of training began to set 
in and I needed to call up all my knowledge and skill that made me a 
ten star Efadio to avoid the next barrage of attacks that made me 
wonder if the Aura Knight had forgotten about its actual target 
altogether.
	Twirling one blade I used my adversary&#39;s momentum to catch 
its weapon with my other blade and in one smooth motion slid down 
below the crossed blades to ram my remaining one into the knight&#39;s 
midsection, succeeding in chopping away a piece of the highly-
resistant armor. &quot;What do you mean with that?&quot; I pressed out through 
clenched teeth, trying to find an opening.
	The Aura Knight had fallen back in surprise at being 
outsmarted like that and had taken a more guarded position. &quot;You have 
betrayed our cause. You are a traitor, associating with the enemy and 
betraying our lord,&quot; it replied in almost monotone tone.
	&quot;What cause? Who ARE you? Adonis is dead!&quot; I seethed, slowly 
losing my patience. At the same time I was wondering at the 
willingness of the knight to even speak. They were mean to rarely 
hold conversations during battle after all.
	&quot;Are you so sure about that?&quot;
	A cold shiver ran down my spin. No, I refuse to believe this 
obvious taunt. This is a high-class warrior. Surely it is only trying 
to get to me. Psychological warfare. It was trying to make me lose my 
patience and to tell the truth I was severally tempted. &quot;Liar!&quot; I 
charged wildly. There was no way Adonis could have survived. No, not 
against HER. Yet the mere thought of the possibility was enough to 
make me lose control. I despised the man almost as much as Venus did. 
He had put both my sister and her mate through so much, not to 
mention controlled and used me. While my kin sister was quite certain 
he had only be a puppy either there were enough things to resent the 
obsessed Venusian for. He WAS dead. Period.
	So snap out of it, Pria!
	I caught myself in time to weave around another swing that 
managed to cut through the dinner table. Shimatta, I need to take 
this outside, there is too little room to move around and the house 
is going to look like a mess. With a quick glance around I corrected 
that the living room at least looked like it already.
	There was a shout that I took of notice of at the edge of my 
awareness and my eyes widened with dread as a cascade of little 
crescent moons impacted with the Aura Knight. I had been so caught up 
in the battle that I had not even noticed that Usagi and Mamoru had 
transformed by now. I really wished they would have gotten away for 
once. There was no time to react anymore as the white magic of the 
Princess&#39; staff was absorbed and released in a nearly point-blank 
angle.
	The impact was crushing and I found myself flying, falling 
hard into a cupboard, bringing the structure down with me painfully. 
I heard shouting and something akin to a warning as I struggled to 
remain conscious from the mind-boggling power and the screaming of my 
body. The only warning I got was the flash of metal and the crackling 
of energy as the Aura Knight came rushing at me. I was too stunned at 
the moment to even hope to move.
	Closing my eyes I awaited the finishing strike anxiously but 
when after a moment nothing happened I dared to open my eyes to a 
quite astonishing sight...

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Jupiter)
My, Luna&#39;s one lucky girl, I mused taking a moment to admire the 
definitely handsome and physically fit human form of Artemis. Well, 
mostly human form. For some reason now that I saw it I remembered 
that both cats were able to assume human form but this was different. 
In a way it seemed more natural and maybe it was at that really their 
natural form, a perfect blend between a human and a feline predator.
	At any other time I would have really liked to admire the 
view some more - hey, a girl is allowed to dream, right? - but the 
situation was dire and I was not satisfied with the way our first 
attack had went. Now with another addition maybe we could come up 
with better results. Yet, I was worried. That brief exchange had told 
me that none of what my memories of the Silver Millennium relayed to 
me was wrong. Sadly so. I had by no means held back in the initial 
assault and the power and even more so the speed of our opponent was 
magnificent. Sensei would probably have loved the challenge, I 
thought.
	Flexing my head that still stung a little from that punch I 
had given the knight - a punch that would have broken about any other 
opponent in half - I stepped next to Venus and Artemis. &quot;Nice show, 
handsome. You&#39;ve got any wise plans of attacks?&quot;
	Artemis had the decency to blush before focusing back on the 
Armor Knight who was a little confused at the strange turns of 
events. &quot;Unfortunately, no. We&#39;ll just have to try our luck.&quot;
	I shrugged and fell into a stance, internally drawing up more 
and more chi. This was going to be unhealthy but there was no time to 
think about this now. I needed to be at the peak of my ability for 
this one. &quot;Right, let&#39;s do it.&quot;
	As one we charged. Falling into a complex pattern I kept the 
Aura Knight busy, careful to avoid his blade and use the tiny bit of 
speed advantage all three of us had again and again to slip past its 
guard, delivering lightning-fast Amaguriken strikes that managed to 
at least stagger it. Ducking away I swayed to the side as Artemis 
came rushing in with his claws outstretched and I watched in 
fascinated wonder how some of the material that had been weakened by 
my initial assault was torn away with swipes faster that even I had 
trouble to keep up. Venus came in next with her blade ready. But it 
was not the Venus Tear that was used to take advantage of the 
exposure. Sparks flew as crystalline-white clashed against obsidian-
black light and while I was still asking myself why our leader had 
rushed in so blindly without following Artemis&#39; and my preparations, 
the knight suddenly stumbled back in shock and obvious pain. I 
glanced down and saw an orange energy chi blade, similar to the ones 
Priapos&#39; tended to use was embedded into where the Aura Knight&#39;s 
armor had been penetrated.
	Tensing my muscles I went to charge and press the advantage 
but as much as Venus&#39; faint had surprised me even more was I 
surprised when the Aura Knight&#39;s hand that had been clutching his 
wound came up and too fast for anyone to react threw something akin 
to a dagger at Venus, also laced with the same dark energy. Our 
leader cried out in pain as the dagger pierced her side and she 
dropped to the ground panting hard. To our collective horror I noted 
that the piece of armor Artemis and I had torn open had already 
regenerated.
	Oh fucking shit, I cursed mentally. This wasn&#39;t normal 
anymore. I had memories of high-class Aura Knights and never had I 
ever encountered something like that. Those were enhanced abilities 
beyond any usual training. Also bothering me were that energy blades. 
The obsidian-black wasn&#39;t a standard color and it made my senses 
tingle when I concentrated on it too long. Of course I was aware that 
this one was definitely in line with our enemy and therefore a 
certain amount of negative energy was to be expected. Still, there 
was something that I just could not correctly pinpoint. This Aura 
Knight just didn&#39;t feel right.
	&quot;Bastard!&quot; Artemis roared and leapt into action but was 
smashed away by the knight with relative ease, receiving a gash over 
his arm that he used to block the strike with. In a way it almost 
seemed like it was enjoying the brutality and viciousness of its 
attacks. But that was ridiculous. Aura Knights were more like 
mercenaries. Vicious, yes. Unnecessary and mad bloodshed, no. That 
sword style was different too. More aggressive, laid out to inflict a 
maximum amount of damage instead of the most efficient way for a 
kill. A style I knew from some...where...
	Nah, no way. Not him. He ought to be long dead. Then again so 
ought to have been the Dark Kingdom, right? It could be a student or 
just a coincidence after all there were surely more than one 
bloodthirsty madman out there. Whatever it was the style definitely 
was familiar. Meant to inflict humiliation and shatter one&#39;s will to 
fight first before a final blow would be delivered. We came close a 
few times to be really beaten... Close, not more, I recalled Venus&#39; 
theory from yesterday. Were they trying to destroy us? Smash our will 
to fight back with this? If HE was really part of it I could at least 
partially understand. Yet I could not be sure.
	&quot;You noticed it too, huh?&quot; I glanced to the side. Venus had 
pushed herself up, clutching her wound but obviously not in the mood 
to give up. Mars, I noticed, had also recovered her wound not as 
fatal as it seemed at first glance, she hung back cautious though. I 
nodded at our leader with a grim attention, following with my eyes as 
Artemis barely flowed around a slash that would have taken his arm 
off and COULD have also succeeded in taking his head off. &quot;I&#39;m 
getting sick of this game,&quot; Venus snarled the Venus Tear reacting to 
her emotions by flashing wildly.
	&quot;They are usually not that... mad. If we were meant to simply 
be put to rest one of those could have caught us off guard outside on 
the street. Aura Knights are not known for keeping taps on morality,&quot; 
I explained, keeping my dark suspicious to myself. After all I 
probably was only seeing ghosts.
	&quot;So, they are refraining from actual killing us? Could that 
be an advantage,&quot; Artemis mused, coming up next to me panting hard. I 
stared at him hard, then glanced back at Venus for confirmation.
After a moment the blonde gave a slow nod. &quot;We&#39;ve got no choice. All 
or nothing.&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Luna)
With narrowed eyes and boiling anger at my own helplessness I watched 
the scene unfold in front of my sharp cat eyes. The creature quickly 
identified as an Aura Knight had invaded the home of my charge&#39;s 
family so suddenly and surprising that none of us had to react or 
prepare. If not for the interference of Venus&#39; elfin sister I doubted 
any of us would have lived this very moment. Priapos had managed to 
hold her own for awhile but the heated bits of conversation reaching 
my ears were enough to momentarily distract her.
	With a growing dread I realized the mistake of my charge when 
she called out her new attack swinging her staff at the Aura Knight 
but wasn&#39;t able to stop it in time and could only watch helplessly 
again as the light magic was absorbed and released with speed too 
fast to avoid. I knew that being a nature elf the mystical power of 
Moon&#39;s staff would not really leave lethal injuries but were enough 
to stun the elf temporally. Enough for the knight to move in for a 
kill...
	A cold flare of anger burst even brighter than before and I 
pushed myself upwards, ignoring the complaints of my small body. I 
deeply wished that I would not be so hindered but cared less for this 
right now as I forced my body into a jump. Nobody would be killed 
today. I would not allow another death ever again. The Silver 
Millennium. D-Point. Enough pointless deaths had already come out of 
this. I would NOT lose them again!
	As I sailed through the air a sudden tingle ran over my body, 
starting from the crescent moon sigil on my forehead and spreading, a 
warmth familiar to me even though it had been years - not counting 
the millennia spent in stasis - that I had felt the sensation of the 
change washing over me. I did not question it. I did not question the 
miracle, aware that a moment&#39;s hesitation could cost the elf&#39;s life. 
Letting myself fall back into the routine and the natural ability all 
of our race was gifted with I willed my body first into the shape of 
a lean and agile panther, using my momentum to smash into the Aura 
Knight, driving it away from Priapos. Bouncing back I curled my body 
into a ball and let the rest of the magic flow, not to assume human 
form but the form that I was born with. The natural form of a Mau 
predator. Claws as magical as they were essential at the same time 
sprang from the hands that had formed, protective fur as resistant as 
the magic protection of a Senshi fuku would be covered my skin.
	Graceful I touched down onto the ground finishing the 
transformation with a flick of my hand as a long staff carved from a 
reddish wood only native to my mother star fell into my hand. &quot;Ah,&quot; I 
said reaching down to offer Priapos a hand to get up again, &quot;I missed 
that.&quot; I suppressed the laughter at the confusion - not to mention 
mild shock - on the Efadio&#39;s face. That quickly cleared away though 
to allow a grim grin replace the expression.
	Accepting my hand she got up and shook her head briefly to 
clear the disorientation the impact had left. Facing away her eyes 
narrowed at the Aura Knight who was hovering a few feet away, a 
little uncertain at the new situation. &quot;I think it made me angry,&quot; 
Priapos stated as a crackling aura of green and gold burst into 
existence around her. An angry Efadio was not something to take 
lightly. &quot;I&#39;ve never been called traitor. I have always been loyal to 
my beliefs. And scum like you who sell their souls on a regular basis 
should not even deserve to know the term.&quot; Uh oh. She wasn&#39;t kidding 
that she was angry. Turning a quick glance at my charge and the 
Prince who stood stunned where they were, she added, &quot;And you two, 
keep your magic to yourself.&quot; They could only nod dumbly. I allowed 
myself to wink at Moon who had her eyes glued on my new form, then 
turned back to join the battle.
	With but only a short nod of understanding both of us 
charged, swaying to opposite sides before coming in our foe. I let 
the staff in my hand blur with motion making it look more like a 
disc. I might be a bit rusty with this body but I was still the 
master of my family&#39;s art and short of Artemis there had never been 
any Mau resident to challenge my rank. The Aura Knight learned that 
quickly as he drew back in surprise just to narrowly dodge the two 
blades of Priapos as she missed only by inches. That, however, gave 
me the opportunity I needed and the staff by now already crackling 
with charged electricity collided with the armor of the knight over a 
thousand times in the span of barely two seconds. The knight 
staggered back startled and I pressed the advantage with a feral 
snarl.
	Maybe I had overestimated my ability to reclaim my old 
physical fitness with a single change, maybe I overestimated the 
resourcefulness of a creature feared in the whole Silver Millennium 
period. Whatever it was I could only let out a startled gasp as the 
free hand of the Aura Knight suddenly shot forward in a motion I 
could simply not see and grasp my hand in a steel-like grip. Crying 
out in pain as I felt bone break I gritted my teeth not daring to 
show weakness. Letting my staff fall into my other hand I prepared a 
counterstrike but never had the time. Eyes widening I rammed the 
staff strayed into the ground and pushed hard as the Aura Knight 
brought his blade down. The momentum from the sudden pull allowed me 
to break free of my opponent&#39;s grip, however, it did not prevent the 
slash from connecting elsewhere. The smell of burned fur and skin 
filled the air and a searing pain shot through my whole body as I 
jumped away, curled into a protective ball. With horror I saw the end 
of my tail hitting the ground and the numbness nearly cost me my 
conscious.
	I managed to control my flight but again was forced to act 
fast albeit the fact I had just lost a vital part of my body. No time 
to think now. If I let myself think I am as good as dead. I watched 
in mid-flight an enraged Priapos rushing in on the Aura Knight with 
precise strikes to the parts of its armor weakened from my assault. 
Again my eyes widened as the knight retailed with his blade held high 
as a glowing sphere built around it. The Efadio flapped her wings at 
the last second altering her flight path and evading the slash that 
let the sphere of dark light free. With a dawning terror I realized 
my landing point would be directly in its flight path.
	Using my uninjured hand I brought the staff around lightning-
fast, pointing to the ground and using it as a spring board touched 
the floor only briefly before taking to the air again. Unfortunately 
I misjudged the effect the loss of my tail would have on my balance 
and the blast caught me in the side, flinging me through the open 
hallway out of the living room and into the entrance corridor. Only 
there I slumped into a wall as an explosion and shattering glass 
rocked Tsukino-ke. White pain began to consume me and I lacked the 
strength to get up again.
	Forgive me, Princess, I failed you, again...

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Venus)
With a fierce battle cry I rushed forward blade held ready to strike. 
My body screamed already from some of the wounds the Aura Knight had 
inflicted me with but I willed even more power from my reserves to 
pour into the Venus Tear. I had not pushed myself so much to my 
limits since rescuing Hotaru in England. That had taken all of my 
willpower and all of my reserves and almost wouldn&#39;t have been 
enough. Blocking out the numbing pain and protests from my body I 
came rushing in with a strike that was as swift as it was suicidal. 
Under any circumstances rushing in while leaving yourself wide-open 
would have ensured death for sure. Our suspicion though proved to be 
right as the Aura Knight hesitated for a crucial moment and therefore 
receiving a slash that would have almost succeeded in taking of its 
head.
	I passed our opponent, bending my body already in mid-air. 
Artemis came in after me with a similar recklessness. His claws 
flashed brightly as he tore at the thick armor of the knight, 
followed shortly by a barrage of punches from Jupiter. I wanted to 
join them but instead waited for the right opportunity, choosing to 
watch. Artemis suddenly blurred and split into several images of 
himself. A move I remembered he was a master of. Something wasn&#39;t 
quite right though because I was able to pick out the right one 
within the first second and so the Aura Knight would have no trouble 
as well. What was he...?
	Oh! A flash of movement at the edge of my perception caught 
my attention and a smirk crossed my face as I readied myself. &quot;Stay 
ready for my signal, then sent me your power,&quot; I spoke softly in the 
communicator, looking briefly over my shoulder at Mercury and the 
injured Mars not too far away. The two Senshi nodded.
	Meanwhile the Aura Knight had obviously lost its patience and 
fixed directly on Artemis - the right one - drew back his sword the 
darkness in the blade expanding to a small sphere. A mere moment 
before it could release the blast Jupiter suddenly had snuck up 
behind him. Whirling around the only thing the Aura Knight succeed in 
doing was to receive the chi-charged spin kick directly in the helmet-
covered face. The force rocked the creature back and it lost its grip 
on the sword, the blade embedding itself in the pavement of the 
street nearby and the blast that had gathered erupting to engulf its 
own caster briefly.
	I was already in motion the moment Jupiter executed her 
maneuver. The Venus Tear held close I put everything I had into the 
strike and my speed. Years of training with Artemis came to fruit as 
I crossed the distance in the blink of an eye. My aim was as accurate 
as you can possible imagine. There was a tearing sound as the crystal 
blades slashed through the dark and pulsating crystal at the back of 
the Aura Knight. The sound of shattered glass was drowned out as the 
backlash of the knight&#39;s own attack reached it. I had already been 
well out of the explosion radius.
	&quot;Now!&quot; I called out bouncing of again the moment my feet 
touched ground to sail in a high arc directly for the obscured form 
of the Aura Knight. Its magical defenses down it had to fight with 
the effects of its own blast and therefore had no way to even pay 
attention to those around it. Streams of blue, red and green joined 
the flaring aura of orange-gold around me moments after and I pushed 
everything into the Venus Tear. Safely to say that the Aura Knight 
never quite knew what hit it as the swirling crystal blades, each 
bathed in a different color came down on it.
	It took several minutes for the dust to settle - so to say. 
We were all breathing hard from the battle and with the exception of 
Mercury who had wisely stood out of the actual fight none of us had 
come out of the ordeal without a few minor or even bigger injuries. 
Mars&#39; wounds turned out to be not that bad but needed to be attended 
to no less. Jupiter and Artemis seemed winded but more or less 
alright. I on the other hand had a hard time staying up. Thankful 
once again for the shared reserves between Hotaru and me I managed to 
clear everyone from the scene and up to a higher building where we 
could take some time to relax and lick our wounds.
	I leaned tiredly against the railing, eyes half-closed as the 
adrenaline slowly drained away and the reality of just how close we 
had come to death or at least some lethal damage. It had been gnawing 
on my patience the last days already. The fact that we had no idea 
what exactly we were up against. However, a foe with such resources 
was not to be underestimated and today&#39;s battle made that even more 
clear. This had been going on long enough. We had to do SOMETHING.
	Popping open my communicator I came face-to-face with a weary 
Usagi who if possible was in the position to mirror my own 
worry. &quot;Hey, I just wanted to warn you. We had a particular nasty run-
in with... What was that thing called? Oh yeah, an Aura Knight. Pria 
says they usually travel in pairs so...&quot; At my grimace her worry 
actually increased. &quot;Oh... I suppose you had the pleasure already.&quot; 
It wasn&#39;t a question.
	After briefly exchanging information on the outcomes of the 
battle I closed the link and trotted over to the others, Artemis - 
back in cat form - trailing behind me. A deep frown had been added to 
the worry in my expression and the others noticed immediately. &quot;That 
was Usagi,&quot; I explained and looking at Jupiter continued, &quot;You 
wondered where the second one was too, right?&quot;
	The taller Senshi nodded, then as I didn&#39;t further elaborated 
her eyes widened. &quot;Oh. Are...&quot;
	&quot;They are all fine. Pria showed up in time. Usagi&#39;s home is 
pretty wrecked though.&quot;
	A thick silence descended over the group as none chose to 
comment but we were all pretty much thinking along the same lines. 
Something had to be done. And soon.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Tuxedo Kamen)
Helplessness was probably a good word to start with to describe the 
way I felt. Once again I could just watch and do nothing. Heck, I&#39;ve 
even been ordered to do nothing. Nice isn&#39;t that? I was supposed to 
protect Usagi, I had promised it. And what was I doing now? Attacked 
by a rampaging creature, her parents unconscious in the middle of the 
battlefield either from shock or blood loss. Usagi knelt opposite 
from me transformed but staring transfixed at the same time, her own 
attempt of attack, almost managing to bring down the only person who 
had kept us alive so far. The person who was not even a Senshi but an 
elf that didn&#39;t even really belong into this time and world. And I?
	I JUST SAT HERE DOING NOTHING!
	Moon had been staring after Luna where she was thrown out of 
the room after being caught by the blast that had shattered not only 
the window leading out to the street but also a good portion of 
furniture and wall. The cry of anguish and pain of the transformed 
cat still echoed in my mind as well and I had to force back the urge 
to retch at the side of the brave cat&#39;s tail being cut off.
	The advantage they briefly might have had over the knight 
creature was gone as well, Priapos was on her own again and it was 
proving to become too much for her despite her best efforts. The 
small space of the room was beginning to give her more and more 
trouble. She was able to slip in and out of the thing&#39;s guard again 
and again but her movements were getting slower and her moving space 
much thinner as the knight slowly pressed its advantage.
	I wished I could do something. Damn it, I needed to do 
something.
	*WE need to something* a shared thought went through my mind, 
echoing both mine and Usagi&#39;s thoughts.
	What was I good for without something to contribute? What 
could I do without a serious power. A power Serenity had said I had 
but did not know how to access. The instance from last time where I 
had somehow helped to form the new Moon Staff. But it hadn&#39;t been me 
accessing this power. It had been Hotaru... or whatever else was 
there inside of her that had helped to channel it. I had no idea what 
I could do, what I should do besides throwing magical roses. And 
despite an accurate aim I could be proud of and their sharpness I 
doubted one of those could cut through an armor like the knight wore.
	*Do not fall to desperation. You are the Prince of Earth. And 
the powers of this planet are at your command.*
	Nani? That voice. I knew it from somewhere. But where? I 
closed my eyes instinctively, reaching deep into myself, feeling the 
ever pulsating essence of my mother star there, strong and confident, 
protective and unyielding. It was a power I knew was there but was 
afraid to ever tap into. I could feel the breath of the Earth, the 
wind blowing through trees, the soft and nitrous soil, the gentle 
flow of water and the raging inferno at the destruction all over its 
surface. This was an experience that had always scared me to a degree 
because I really had no idea how to handle it. Truth be told, maybe 
this was just the power Serenity had been speaking off, yet the 
responsibility and the enormousness had always made me shy away. How 
could I harness energies such as these without damaging the Earth, 
how could I harness them without fear of hurting those around me 
accidentally. I felt inadequate but scared at the same time.
	And it was time that changed. It was time that I accepted 
what I had been and could be for the sake of the people around me. 
For Usagi, her friends... my friends. For the family we were despite 
all the differences. It was time to be the Prince. Not just the 
nameless savior.
	*Concentrate all your energy into your hands...*
	And I did. I drew from that infinite-seeming pool of power 
and channeled them through my bodies into my open palms. Arcs of 
crackling power raced along my outstretched arms and gathered into a 
brightly glowing golden-white sphere of light between my hands. My 
eyes snapped open and there was a sudden confidence there. A need to 
protect and a knowledge that I could. It did not surprise me to see 
that Moon was still hunched in her position but had taken off her 
tiara glowing in its magical light and held at the ready.
	I caught movement from the corridor and almost didn&#39;t quite 
trust my eyes at the sheer stubbornness. Being in a good position 
allowed me to see that Luna had obviously given up the struggle to 
get back to her feet but right now her staff was pulsing with energy 
while its wielder was near total exhaustion but refused with a fierce 
determination to give in. In the fraction of mere moments a plan was 
made and with a simple signal conveyed to Priapos. The elf had not 
only drilled fighting skill into us but also tactical awareness and 
it was the first time this was really showing.
	In a move I found truly amazing and would have gawked at in 
another situation Priapos suddenly jumped upwards, flapping her wings 
in the process to somehow pass the narrow space between the huge 
figure of the knight and the ceiling and land on the other side. 
Instead of using the moment to her advantage she back-flipped two 
times to avoid a swing that might have cut her head off but carried 
her opponent directly into Luna&#39;s view.
	Everything happened so fast it was hard to actually point out 
the order.
	With the last bit of strength Luna sent her staff flying. The 
knight was unprepared for the sudden projectile impacting with its 
armored stomach.
	The moment Luna had released her weapon I had already done 
likewise with the gathered energy. A shout of &quot;TUXEDO SMOKING 
BOMBER!&quot; echoing through the room. The energy exploding like a 
concussive blast into the head of the knight sending it stumbling.
	Moon waited for a moment longer that seemed to stretch 
forever. &quot;MOON TIARA ACTION!&quot; Then the glowing disc sliced through 
the air and the small crystal at the base of the knight&#39;s back with 
almost clinical procession.
	Priapos aura suddenly flared a bright green as she crossed 
her blades, the edges crackling with powerful magic of a magnitude 
she had never shown in any of our training sessions. The knight 
howled loudly as the magic-enhanced blades cut through its protective 
armor almost like butter, opening deep gaping wounds of black liquid.
	&quot;MOON PRINCESS HALATION!&quot;
	That was the last the knight ever heard.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Hotaru)
It was nearing sunset... Well, to be exact the sun was already 
beginning to set. The orange-red hue bathed the city in a beautiful 
display of light. Innocent and only always following its physical 
laws. The Earth rotated and the sun was rising and setting. Totally 
unsuspecting. Unsuspecting as much as most of the world in the face 
of the true horror that really wandered this blue planet&#39;s surface.
	Okay, I admit it. I like poetry. A little. Maybe I am going 
to study it. But that is really besides the point.
	Right now I sat on the front porch of Tsukino-ke staring out 
at the sunset and actually trying to think nothing. A few hours ago, 
when this day had started I had thought my biggest worry for the day 
would be talking to Rei or dealing with calls from a family that 
wanted me back with the only intend to keep me at a tight leash. Hey, 
I had even been meant to go shopping and see if I could find 
something nice for Aino-chan&#39;s birthday already.
	&quot;Are you feeling better?&quot; I asked into the silence, 
absentmindedly caressing the soft fur of the cat in my nap. Another 
of those things. Sometime ago I wouldn&#39;t have imagined me sitting out 
here alone with the one... creature that had been so wary and 
suspicious of myself at first. It wasn&#39;t that I was carrying a grudge 
or anything, just...
	&quot;It is healing nicely,&quot; Luna replied, flicking her tail to 
emphasize the statement but her voice sounded tired and... hollow. 
Weakly she lifted her small head to me with an expression full of 
guilt and unguarded gratitude that it almost broke my heart. &quot;Domo 
arigato, Hotaru-san. I owe you my life.&quot; Which was no understatement 
since she had explained to me that the tail of her race was in 
reality a vital organ which would in the best of cases had crippled 
her. Paralyzed like a human with damage to the spine.
	When I had come into Tsukino-ke, debating with myself whether 
to follow the distraught signals my mate was giving out or the 
obvious source of explosions and battle from Usagi&#39;s neighborhood, I 
didn&#39;t really know how I had known that it was Luna or that anything 
of the horrible sight presented to me had to be ignored and pushed 
back into a far corner of my consciousness. I had just done it. In 
the last days I had tended the one or other bad wound from one of the 
Senshi and I had sort of really learned to gauge my limitations and 
until today I wasn&#39;t certain if I had ever managed to call up so much 
healing energy before. Everything sort of faded away around me and 
there was just me, Luna, the wound and the power. I think I must have 
blacked out briefly but I had done it.
	&quot;And yet you do not trust me fully.&quot; I stated, staring deep 
into red eyes that held so much wisdom but also loneliness gathered 
in years of service at the one&#39;s she had tried to guide and protect 
and almost lost again today. &quot;But that is besides the point, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot;
	The cat did not answer but her eyes said enough for me as 
they slowly closed and her breathing evened out. For a several more 
minutes I sat there. It was time to go home. Minako was already 
waiting. She had insisted to come and get me but I had read the 
fatigue from her own battle clearly in her voice. I told her I just 
needed to recover from the amount of healing done and that I would I 
come home then.
	Things had calmed down a little. Usagi&#39;s brother had come 
home - of course it was hard not to miss all the commotion - and was 
now inside helping Usagi and Mamoru clean up some of the mess. Their 
parents were resting upstairs. Kenji&#39;s injuries had merely been 
superficial though he did have a lot of luck. Both would need some 
rest but would be alright much to the relieve of the two younger 
Tsukinos. It had been a very close call though and everyone - well, 
young Shingo aside - were aware of that.
	&quot;Hey.&quot; I looked up to see Priapos emerge from the entrance. 
She had donned her glamour again which might be better considering 
the situation. I mean we didn&#39;t need a young boy claiming to have 
seen an elf when his parents probably would have claimed the same. 
Again, this could easily be traced back to shock. All in all it was a 
small miracle that both Usagi and Mamoru had come out off this alive 
WITH their covers intact.
	&quot;Hey,&quot; I returned back to the elf as she sat down next to 
me. &quot;What a mess, huh?&quot;
	Priapos quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Who are you telling this. I was 
right at the center.&quot; She fell silent for a moment and I almost 
jumped at the soft hand on my shoulder. &quot;I am glad you weren&#39;t in any 
of this. I could have not lived with the thought that something 
happened to you... again.&quot; Anyone not familiar with our history would 
have not caught the brief flash of guilt and shame but I did.
	&quot;Why don&#39;t you come home with me tonight.&quot; The elfin girl 
lifted her face a little surprise and with a silent question. I 
simply chose to smile and nod. &quot;Minako would like it and you have 
spent so little time with us lately.&quot; Taking the hand on my shoulder 
and squeezing it slightly, I added, &quot;We are a family after all.&quot;
	The warm smile Priapos gave me was enough of an answer and 
there really wasn&#39;t much more to say. &quot;Go on and get Artemis. I&#39;ll 
join you in a few minutes.&quot; Hesitating I searched her face for a few 
moments skeptically but then nodded and got up to silent return into 
the house, going to retrieve the other cat who had dragged himself 
here worry about Luna evident.


A few minutes later Priapos watched the raven-haired girl walk away 
from Tsukino-ke now instead of the black cat in her arms a white one 
perched on her shoulder.
	&quot;Can you try to make less of a mess next time.&quot;
	The Efadio didn&#39;t turn around from her spot on the roof as 
the other woman stepped up next to her. &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll like to try it 
next time. I&#39;d like to see how you fare against one of those outside 
of your domain.&quot; 
	The woman shook her head sadly and sighed. &quot;Gomen nasei, I 
was out of line. Considering the circumstances everything went well, 
for now.&quot;
	&quot;Will they remember anything of this day?&quot; Priapos asked 
after a short silence.
	&quot;They will remember enough. It would be a problem to explain 
the damage done after all. Just stick to the cover story.&quot;
	&quot;Of course.&quot;
	As Priapos took flight to shortly afterwards join the raven-
haired girl the other woman raised her staff, a red jewel flaring 
briefly at its top, and then she vanished into thin air.

TBC in Episode 4

Family problems ahead and startling new revelations. Some of Makoto&#39;s 
suspicions are confirmed, Ami and Rei share secrets with the rests 
and decisions will be made. It is time for a birthday but of course 
when delusional families, Youma and other problems are present the 
outcome might not necessary be a happy one.
Be sure to be there next time, then the build-up of the last episodes 
arrives at its peak.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

Endymion: So... Err... Moral, right. You don&#39;t have to look at me 
that way, Usako. I even prepared one, really.
Moon: *starry-eyed* Really? Oh, you are so sweet, Mamo-chan. At least 
you are on my side and share my opinion that there should be a moral 
at the end, right?
Endymion: *nods quickly* Of course, of course...
Luna (signing in): Your Majesty, did you forget...
Moon: *giant head looming over Luna* NO, HE DID NOT FORGET ANYTHING!
Luna: *unimpressed* Don&#39;t be so irresponsible! You both have 
appointments in a few minutes and you know that!
Moon: But... but...
Endymion: *sighs* She&#39;s right, you know? I should have been gone 
about half an hour ago.
Endymion has signed off.
Moon: *sputtering* Mamo-chan! Is anyone ever going to do their moral 
when they are supposed to?
Luna: *dragging off Moon* Come on, you have fooled around long enough.
Moon: Luna...
Moon and Luna have signed off and the screen is blank for several 
moments.
Priapos (signing in): Ah, poor kid. No one acknowledges the virtue of 
having some fun anymore. Really, that was exactly what I hated about 
living in a palace. All those stiff people who are only interested in 
politics and other such stuff. I mean an elf needs some fun once in 
awhile and...
*several moments of silence*
Priapos: *sheepish* Err... Forgot that I have to be back for dinner 
with *censored* or I&#39;ll really get into trouble, he he... Gomen, 
Usagi. No moral today.
Priapos has signed off.

Author&#39;s Notes

That was once again one of those episodes that didn&#39;t want to be 
finished. While I had been through with about the first half fairly 
quickly, playing Wind Waker/Master Quest sort of diverted my 
attention for awhile before Maia sprung the dual battle idea on me 
which once again led to some unplanned elements being involved. Oh 
well... *shrugs* I really am not that fond of babbling on and on 
after such a long episode right now.

During Episode 29 when Reika was introduced and her rainbow shard 
stolen Motoki mentions to Mamoru (more in good humor though) that he 
sees the girls (mainly Usagi and Makoto like little sisters). That&#39;s 
where the comment came from.
There is no proof, to my knowledge, that Motoki and Mamoru know each 
other from before university life. There isn&#39;t even a direct 
connection between them in the manga opposed to first season anime, I 
am merely assuming.
Another manga element that I had been preparing for awhile already 
are Mamoru&#39;s powers. I suppose everyone who read the manga recognized 
the attack. While I planned to reveal them in this arc as it has been 
in the manga things were sort of sped up in the heat of the battle so 
to say. The same goes for the sudden resurfacing of Luna and Artemis 
shape-shifting ability.

Surprisingly enough there really has not been much to say other than 
that. A lot of questions surely have been raised in this episode that 
I WILL answer but not right now. You have to be patient a little 
while longer.

And that&#39;s it. Feedback as always is appreciated.

Ja ne, yours
