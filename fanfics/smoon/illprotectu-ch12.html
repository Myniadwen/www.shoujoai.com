<h1>I'll Protect You (part 12 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>As Rinka arrived inside the theatre, wearing casual clothes and a baby 
blue shoulder bag, she immediately spotted Minako practicing on the 
stage and waved at the pop star who smiled and waved back, then went 
back to dance like she wasn&#39;t bothered at all

Then Rinka searched for Rei, whom she found mumbling behind a piece of 
paper on her seat. She merrily approached and greeted the busy co-agent

&quot;Ohaiyo Rei-sama! What are you reading?&quot; Rinka asked

It seems Rei didn&#39;t heard her

&quot;Yuhoo! Rei-sama, get back to earth!&quot; Rinka said in a little loud voice 
that is enough to startle Rei

&quot;Gyah! Rinka-chan? When did you get in here?&quot; Asked the still startled 
Rei

&quot;About twenty-five years ago! And you were really a great view with that 
paper&quot; Said Rinka in a mix of a cute and sarcastic tone

&quot;Oh...sorry. You know paper works drive me mentally insane&quot; Rei said as 
she quickly hides the paper back to her pocket

&#39;I&#39;ll deal with this later&#39;

&quot;Head chief gave you a paper work? How can he do this to you? He knows 
you were suppose to be busy guarding Aino-san and&#151;&quot;

&quot;Relax Rinka-chan. This isn&#39;t that important to give attention to. I&#39;m 
just reading it to study and entertain myself&quot; Rei cuts in

&quot;Oh. I see...&quot; Said Rinka

Rei looked at the younger agent

&quot;It seems that you are not here for just a visit ne?&quot; Rei asked

Rinka shrugged then nodded as she sat beside Rei&#39;s seat

&quot;Rei-sama, I watched TV this morning and found out some news about 
Aino-san. The host stated that they have read it from a local news paper 
and...&quot;

Rinka took a newspaper out of her bag and gave it to Rei

&quot;It&#39;s about you and Aino-san&quot; Rinka finished

Rei was stunned after reading the front page of the paper it read:

&quot;More than a bodyguard?&quot; With two pictures beneath the large font. First 
one is a picture of her and Minako hugging inside the hotel the very 
first day they met. The second one is a picture where Rei is wrapping 
her uniform at Minako to warm her body in the channel six studios

&#39;Crap&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m really mad at those media who took this picture! They&#39;ll do 
anything even false issues just to make money out of it. Not to mention 
that they&#39;re doing a good job at ruining your noble name Rei-sama&quot; Rinka 
said

&quot;And even if it&#39;s true, they could&#39;ve at least just made it as a blind 
item&quot;

Rei smiled at the younger agent&#39;s defense

&quot;Hey calm down, what else can we do? Media has the freedom of speech, 
and although we have that too, I can&#39;t risk ruining the name of the TNPH 
if I react against this non-sense issue&quot; Rei explained

Rinka nodded

&quot;Hai, you&#39;re right! But I&#39;m still defending you no matter what, 
Rei-sama&quot; Rinka pouted

&quot;...Thanks Rinka-chan&quot; Rei said

&quot;...Uh, Rei-sama?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t get mad if I asked you this?&quot;

&quot;I Promise I won&#39;t break a single nerve, what is it?&quot; Rei asked

Rinka looked around her and made sure no one is around in their area 
before she whispered to Rei

&quot;Are you and Aino-san...er...lovers?&quot; Rinka asked cautiously

Rei blinked few times, Rinka is alert whatever reaction she may show

&quot;I-I mean...you see...Aino-san asked me to...and she-she...er well...she 
just...argh, gomen Rei-sama! I should&#39;ve asked you that, 
gomengomengomen!&quot; Rinka closed her eyes to avoid what she thought 
Rei-will-kill-me-this-time look. She was completely pale in fear and 
blushing at the same time

Rei gently patted Rinka&#39;s head

&quot;Hey, hush Rinka-chan, I won&#39;t eat you alive&quot; Said Rei as she laughed

Rinka sighed in relief that Rei wasn&#39;t mad

&quot;Now, breathe slowly and after that you can calmly tell me the reason 
why you asked that okay?&quot; Rei said

Rinka did what she was told, she breathes slowly and then continued in a 
calmer tone

&quot;Well, you see, when you were away in the general&#39;s meeting yesterday, 
she kept asking me questions about you like what is your favorite color 
and favorite food and many more while we were at the hotel. Then when 
she got tired of waiting for your arrival she secretly left the studio 
with me and asked where general Satoshi&#39;s office is...and...&quot;

Rinka paused

&quot;And then what?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;When it rained I saw you two...hugging, and you kissed her forehead. 
Even after I called a taxi she is still hugging you...I just want to 
confirm it directly from you Rei-sama&quot; Rinka said

Rei observed the young agent for a while first then she sighed and laid 
her head at the back support of the seat, making her face the huge 
ceiling of the stadium

&quot;Do you believe me if I say that &#39;love for a stranger chooses no time or 
gender&#39;?&quot; Asked Rei

Rinka gasped softly

&quot;So...it is true...oh, Rei-sama, I&#39;m so happy for you and Aino-san&quot; 
Whispered Rinka excitediy

Rei shook her head

&quot;Nobody knows except for you, Ms. Wendy and&#151;&quot;

Rei paused

&quot;And who?&quot; Asked Rinka

&quot;No, just the two of you knew&quot;

&quot;Wait, you mean the head chief doesn&#39;t know?&quot;

&quot;I doubt that he&#39;ll accept the news in a calm manner&quot; Rei said

Rinka stood up and looked directly at Rei&#39;s face

&quot;Rei-sama, you can count on me. I&#39;ll keep my mouth shut, I promise. I 
understand you and Aino-san&#39;s situation, I know you don&#39;t want to ruin 
her career&quot; Rinka said in a soft tone so that no one could hear

Rei smiled. She was very relieved that Rinka is still the same after she 
admitted everything

&quot;I&#39;m really glad I have a friend like you, Rinka-chan&quot; Rei said

Rinka waved her hand

&quot;Nah, that was nothing compared to all the help you gave to me whenever 
I&#39;m in need. No matter what, I&#39;m there for you. Remember that&quot; Rinka 
said as she walks her way outside the theatre

&quot;W-wait, that was it? This is all you&#39;ve come for? To ask me that?&quot; Rei 
asked in disbelief

Rinka winked at her then ran to escape immediately

&quot;Oh&#151;why you little&#151;&quot; Rei wasn&#39;t supposed to let that slip but she just 
changed her mind and let Rinka run outside...along with her secret

Rei stared at the fading image of Rinka out of the exit. She smiled as 
she went back to her seat and watched her love Minako practice their 
dance, making her forget the riddle from Sanctuary for a while

After a few minutes Rei decided to join Wendy on her seat

&quot;Ms. Hino, are you feeling better now?&quot; Wendy asked

&quot;Me? I guess so&quot; Rei said as she relaxes at her seat

-----

-Few hours passed-

&quot;Okay everyone break time, come back at four!&quot; The director shouted to 
all his crew

&quot;Ms. Aino, get back in time okay?&quot; Said the director

&quot;Get back in time, got it&quot; Said Minako as she excitedly jumps down the 
stage and went in Wendy and Rei&#39;s direction

Wendy hands her a towel while a utility personnel hands them each a 
mineral water

&quot;Hey Wends, did you mention that we were going to visit the Minister 
before we go in here?&quot; Asked Minako

&quot;The Minister and his wife invited us in their house for lunch, that&#39;s 
why they changed the schedule here in the theatre&quot; Wendy said

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll rest for a few minutes then we&#39;ll go there&quot; Minako said then 
she turned and sat next to Rei, who is playing with her mineral water 
absent mindedly

&quot;Hey, Rei-chan! How are doing? You look bored&quot; Minako asked

Rei awoke from her thought as she heard her lover&#39;s ever gentle but 
lively voice

&quot;Wha&#151;me? No, I&#39;m just thinking of something&quot; Rei said

&quot;Thinking of something ne? Does that involve a beautiful blonde named 
Minako in it?&quot; Minako asked

&quot;Of course, I need that for inspiration&quot;

The two lovers looked intently at each other. Wendy sweat dropped

&quot;If I were you I would get a room&quot; Wendy commented

Rei blushed while Minako smirked

&quot;Twenty minutes Wendy&quot; Minako said, Rei didn&#39;t get what Minako meant, 
but Wendy does

&quot;Okay, your twenty minutes starts now&quot; Wendy said

&quot;Follow me Rei-chan&quot; Minako said as she hands Rei her wardrobe and 
started walking away from Wendy

&quot;Huh? W-Where are you going Ms. Aino?&quot; Rei asked as she quickly followed 
the pop star to whatever direction she goes, she told the two agents who 
watched Minako for a while that morning to take care of Wendy and they 
both nodded in response

They both end up in the private dressing room reserved for Minako. As 
they went inside the pop star locked the door, while Rei hang Minako&#39;s 
wardrobe at the back of the door

They looked at each other for a while. Then they started to lean against 
each other and kissed each other&#39;s lips passionately

As they parted breathlessly

&quot;...So this is the twenty minutes you&#39;re talking about&quot; Rei said 
teasingly

&quot;It&#39;s not just that&quot; Minako said

After giving her lover a quick peck on the cheek Minako squeezed Rei&#39;s 
cheeks mercilessly with her right thumb and index finger

&quot;Ooooouuuccchhh!&quot;

&quot;Starting now don&#39;t call me Ms. Aino ever again okay, Rei-san?&quot; Minako 
said

&quot;But didn&#39;t you realize what the people around us would think if I call 
you &#39;Mina-chan&#39;?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;They can think whatever they want to think, just call me that okay? 
Even my bodyguards in Europe called me Aino-chan&quot;

&quot;Alright, alright Mina-chan is settled! Just let go, it really hurts!&quot; 
Pleaded Rei, then Minako finally let go the squeeze on her cheeks

&quot;Where did you get all the strength to squeeze that strong?&quot; Rei asked 
as she rubs her squeezed cheek

&quot;My strength comes whenever I needed them to use for you&quot; Minako teased

Rei smirked then kissed her pop star lover

&quot;I missed you already&quot; Rei said

&quot;I missed you too&quot; Replied Minako

&quot;How is the rehearsal going?&quot;

&quot;Hmm, just fine. The new steps were easy so no need to worry about the 
concert I guess&quot;

&quot;Did it make you tired?&quot;

&quot;Just a bit...Oh, Rei-chan I have something to show to you!&quot; Minako 
pouted as she raises her left hand and showed her fingers to her lover

Rei quickly noticed a small cut at the tip of Minako&#39;s index finger

&quot;Mina-chan, what happened here?&quot; Rei asked worriedly as she held her 
lover&#39;s hand and gently caresses the cut on the finger

&quot;I got it when I held one of the props for my concert&quot; Minako whined

&quot;Want me to call the medics?&quot; Rei asked

Minako lifted up her left hand equal the length of Rei&#39;s lips. Rei 
didn&#39;t need to be told what to do; she started licking Minako&#39;s cut 
finger and sucked it gently. Minako removed her finger from her lover&#39;s 
mouth and she kissed her once again

Minako parted her lips

&quot;Crap, why did I only asked twenty minutes? I should&#39;ve asked for an 
hour!&quot; Minako complained

&quot;You have a Minister to visit to Mina-chan; you can&#39;t let them wait for 
you. So stop talking and we&#39;ll make the remaining minutes worth&quot; Said 
Rei as she continue kissing Minako

After the twenty minute time limit the two of them went back to where 
Wendy is waiting patiently. Wendy asked some of the theatre&#39;s 
beauticians to give Minako a make-up. Then they proceeded towards the 
exit to go at the parking lot where they wave farewell to the head chief

The head chief sent five of his men to help Rei along their way to the 
minister&#39;s house. Now there are two black vans running at the front and 
back of Minako&#39;s limo, making them sandwiched at the middle

They have arrived at the Minister&#39;s house five minutes early from their 
meeting schedule. As they usually expected, there are media men waiting 
for Minako&#39;s arrival. The Minister&#39;s guards were lined up at the 
entrance to assist Minako&#39;s arrival. As Rei parked the limo in the front 
of the gate, she went out and gave the car keys to the house valet; one 
of the guards opened the door to assist Minako and Wendy out

Rei was surprised when the media approached at her and fired her 
hundreds of questions while they took pictures of her

&quot;Is it true that you have a relation with Minako Aino?&quot;

&quot;Some say that they saw you hugging her&quot;

&quot;If you are not involved with Minako Aino then why are you so close to 
her?&quot;

&quot;Are you really aware that you are in a same sex relationship?&quot;

Those questions were driving Rei insane. The flashing of the cameras 
grew worse when Minako appeared at beside Rei and their noise became 
louder as they now asked Minako almost the same questions they asked Rei

&quot;What are you people talking about? This person is my best friend when I 
was in my elementary days. I was really surprised to meet her again and 
of course we were best friends, that&#39;s why we&#39;re really close to each 
other&quot; Lied Minako as she held Rei&#39;s shaking shoulders

&quot;Then can you explain to us why you hugged her back then at the hotel?&quot; 
A reporter asked Rei

&quot;Uh...er...I...I was doing my job?&quot; Said Rei with uncertainty

&#39;Good answer Rei-chan&#39; Minako thought as she continued Rei&#39;s answer

&quot;I was really scared that day because you guys managed to slip from the 
security and madly approached at me, so I find someone to hold on to. 
Then she caught hold of me and hugged me so that I won&#39;t get hurt from 
the people trying to get near me&quot; Minako explained. It was true after 
all

&quot;Well gotta go, the Minister is waiting for us&quot; Wendy interrupted as she 
passes by the media. Minako and Rei followed inside

&quot;Best friend eh? You didn&#39;t even answered the first question&quot; Rei 
whispered as she smirked at Minako

&quot;What? That we have a relation? It&#39;s alright. I didn&#39;t even say that we 
didn&#39;t right?&quot; Minako winked at her

Rei just shook her head

&quot;You&#39;re amazing&quot; She whispered

The guards closed the gate after they have entered inside. The Minister 
and his wife went outside the front entrance of their house to greet 
Minako personally

&quot;Welcome Ms. Aino&quot; The Minister greeted

Minako bowed and shook hands with the Minister and his wife

&quot;Thank you for inviting us in your house sir&quot; Minako said

Rei was looking around inside the Minister&#39;s House. It looked like more 
of a rest house, quiet and peaceful. She was amazed when she saw how 
many collections of antique plaques with different kinds of classic and 
orchestral music

&quot;Wow, I wish I had a collection as big as this&quot; Rei mumbled

&quot;The Minister loves all sorts of classic and instrumental music, it was 
really odd that he liked Minako&#39;s music&quot; Wendy whispered to Rei then she 
let out an uncontrolled giggle

The Minister and his wife guided Minako and the others at their dining 
table. Rei stood at the corner and observed the whole place while 
guarding Minako at the same time. Minako and Wendy sat at the table 
chair beside the Minister&#39;s chair and opposite his wife. The hired chef 
delivered the food at the table and served each of them on their plates. 
After eating lunch hey talked for about thirty minutes in the Minister&#39;s 
guest room

After the visit with the Minister and his wife, Minako asked Rei to drop 
by at her parent&#39;s house to visit them for a short while

&quot;So, how&#39;s your rehearsal doing, Minako?&quot; Mrs. Aino asked as she enters 
their guest room with a tray containing tea cups

&quot;It&#39;s easy and tiring at the same time. After this I have to get back to 
the theatre to continue our rehearsal. Tomorrow will be our final 
rehearsal so I won&#39;t have the time to pay a visit starting tomorrow&quot; 
Minako stated

&quot;It&#39;s alright baby. We can still reach you by cell phone right? Don&#39;t 
worry about us we&#39;re doing fine here&quot; Mr. Aino said, and then he looked 
at Rei

&quot;I watched the television and saw you and Rei-san&quot; Mr. Aino added

Rei almost sprayed the tea she was drinking when she heard Mr. Aino. 
Minako&#39;s dad stood up and approached her. Rei gulped

Mr. Aino held Rei&#39;s hand and...

&quot;How could they accuse crimes to such beauty? Did they hurt you Rei-san? 
Are you feeling alright now?&quot; Mr. Aino said, babying Rei&#39;s hand

All girls in the guest room sweat dropped

&quot;Dad stop that, you&#39;re over reacting! Besides, Rei-chan didn&#39;t do any 
crime&quot; Minako said with her hands on her waist

&quot;But you said that you and Rei-san were best friends there&quot; Mrs. Aino 
said

&quot;I just said that because that&#39;s the first thing that came from my mind. 
If I stay silent after that issue, they&#39;ll just quit bugging me about 
that&quot; Minako explained

&quot;Well, that&#39;s always the answer to that problem. Stay silent&quot; Mrs. Aino 
said

Wendy&#39;s cell phone rang

&quot;Hello, this Wendy speaking...Heather? I thought you and the others will 
arrive tomorrow?...Oh, I see. We&#39;ll see you at the hotel tonight 
then...bye and have a safe flight&quot;

Wendy folded her flip top cell phone

&quot;Is there any problem Wends?&quot; Minako asked

&quot;There&#39;s no problem Aino, it&#39;s just your make-up artists and your 
fashion designer. They said no plane going to Tokyo will be available 
today so they decided to take yesterday&#39;s flight. They will be arriving 
tonight&quot; Wendy explained

&quot;Is that so Ms. Wendy? Do you want me to call some agents to escort them 
to the hotel?&quot; Rei offered

&quot;Yes please, Ms. Hino&quot;

Rei nodded and contacted the head chief through her ear phone. Wendy 
looked at her watch and then looked at Minako knowingly. The pop star 
nodded

&quot;Mom, Dad, we&#39;ll go back to the theatre now&quot; Minako said sadly

Mr. and Mrs. Aino stood up to kiss their daughter good bye and bowed at 
Wendy and Rei who bowed back

&quot;Don&#39;t push yourself too much to work okay, Minako?&quot; Mrs. Aino said

&quot;Be careful out there&quot; Mr. Aino said

&quot;Thank you very much for the hospitality&quot; Wendy said

&quot;We will be going&quot; Rei said as she bows again

&quot;Bye Mom, bye Dad! Thanks for the tea!&quot; Minako waved her hand then 
quickly catches up with Wendy followed by Rei

As they reach the limo Rei assisted them inside. Then before Rei could 
enter the driver&#39;s seat, she saw a handsome hazel haired young man 
looking at her twenty feet far from their position

The young man was holding a long white feather. He placed the feather on 
his handsome face, caressing his cheeks and chin then he looked directly 
at Rei&#39;s cerulean eyes

&quot;Rei-chan, what is it? Did you see something or someone?&quot; Minako 
interrupted Rei&#39;s eye contact

Rei glanced at her lover then went back to the man&#39;s direction but he 
was gone already

&quot;Rei-chan are you alright?&quot;

Rei nodded her head

&quot;I&#39;m alright. I just thought I saw someone&quot; Said Rei as she sits inside 
the limo and started the engine

As the limo faded from the streets the same young man reappeared from 
behind the telephone booth where he hid

-----

What a boring chapter hehehe...

My mind is focused at our incoming volleyball competition so I couldn&#39;t 
daydream...Imagine me playing volleyball while daydreaming? I&#39;ll 
probably end up being out of the game or at the bench because I kissed 
my cute opponent :p</pre>
