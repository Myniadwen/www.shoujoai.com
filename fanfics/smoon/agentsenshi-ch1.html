<h1>Hotaru and Minako: Agents of S.E.N.S.H.I. (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Minako pushed up her black sunglasses, her long blonde hair flowing as 
she knocked on the door. A few moments later a sandy haired, boyish 
looking woman opened the door, looking at them curiously. &quot;Haruka 
Tenoh?&quot; she asked her calmly, taking off her shades and sliding them 
away into her pocket all with one motion.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Haruka asked, her eyes narrowing a little as she studied the 
black clad figures. Both women wore black suits, the types government 
agencies might issue, with almost razor sharp ironing on the creases. 
Her own pajamas were suited to sleeping in this Sunday morning, but 
looking at the two of them told her it wasn&#39;t likely she was going back 
to bed anytime soon.

&quot;Minako Aino,&quot; she casually offered her wallet, the star badge gleaming, 
&quot;we&#39;re here to talk about your wedding.&quot;

&quot; S.E.N.S.H.I.?&quot; Haruka blinked at what was written on the badge.

&quot;Supreme Enforcement Network and Special Headquarters of 
Investigations,&quot; the slightly smaller black haired young woman offered 
up the information, &quot;and my name is Hotaru Tomoe.&quot; She smiled slightly, 
&quot;May we come in?&quot;

&quot;Oh, of course,&quot; Haruka gestured and both women walked inside, her 
thoughtful gaze following them in. She waved them towards the couch as 
she asked, &quot;So what&#39;s this all about?&quot;

&quot;Are your partners here?&quot; Minako asked with a degree of amusement as she 
and Hotaru sat. &quot;I&#39;d hate to try to run through everything multiple 
times.&quot;

&quot;I was hoping we could let them sleep.&quot; Haruka studied them a moment 
then sighed, &quot;all right, give me a moment.&quot;

&quot;This is going to be an interesting case,&quot; Hotaru murmured to Minako 
softly as Haruka shuffled out of the room, clearly still sleepy.

&quot;They&#39;re all interesting cases at S.E.N.S.H.I.,&quot; Minako answered with a 
twinkle in her eye.

&quot;Yes, but why do we keep getting assigned the really interesting ones?&quot; 
Hotaru flashed one of her rare smiles.

Haruka returned with two women in tow, all three very different physical 
types. Michiru Kaoru was simply gorgeous, a green haired lady who looked 
like a model, her eyes shining with gentle amusement. The tallest was 
Setsuna Meiou, her black hair flowing like some regal cape down her 
back. And right in the middle was Haruka, the slim figure who was a 
perfect compliment to them both.

&quot;Welcome to our home,&quot; Michiru offered, wearing a robe over what looked 
like a nightie as the three sat on a couch together, &quot;and I&#39;m sorry I 
wasn&#39;t able to greet you earlier.&quot; She tossed a fond look at Haruka, 
&quot;Instead you had to deal with Miss Grumpy here.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Haruka protested, &quot;I was polite.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s quite all right,&quot; Minako said reassuringly.

&quot;We&#39;re usually up earlier today,&quot; Michiru looked faintly amused, &quot;but a 
certain person helped keep us all up.&quot;

&quot;Michiru,&quot; Setsuna scolded while Haruka just looked very satisfied, much 
like the proverbial cat that ate the cream.

&quot;I didn&#39;t need to know that,&quot; Hotaru murmured with a blush.

Minako got up to pass her badge around once more as she said, &quot;You&#39;re 
likely well aware of the resistance to your upcoming marriage in the 
political right, but what you may not know is that several serious 
threats have been made. Our agency has been assigned to counter those 
threats and help protect the ceremony.&quot;

&quot;Why weren&#39;t we informed of these threats?&quot; Haruka sat up, frowning.

&quot;I think your families may believe you&#39;ve had enough to deal with Ms. 
Tenoh, considering you are marrying your two sweethearts,&quot; Hotaru said 
mildly.

&quot;Heh, true,&quot; Haruka conceded.

&quot;We were hoping that you&#39;d consider postponing the wedding until we can 
deal with the suspect,&quot; Minako said in business like tones, &quot;or at least 
consider moving it to a less public place than the Crystal Palace 
casino.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Michiru shook her head, &quot;we&#39;ve been waiting years to be married, I 
don&#39;t want someone to scare us into delaying.&quot;

&quot;Delaying would just feed the ego of your suspect,&quot; Setsuna pointed out. 
She smiled faintly, &quot;Besides, Haruka has the best security at her 
Crystal Palace, you know.&quot;

Minako sighed softly, studying Haruka intently. In her teens and 
twenties she had made a name for herself as a international racer, 
making money both in prizes and promoting products. Investing wisely her 
and her lover Michiru had become quite wealthy, eventually becoming the 
co-owners of the spectacular Crystal Palace casino in Tokyo. It had been 
there that they met Professor Setsuna Meiou, a psychologist hired by the 
casino to study customer patterns in game play, and a whirlwind romance 
had begun between the three of them.

Unusually, all three were activists for gay rights in their different 
ways. Haruka donated to various causes, of course, and spoke up in 
public about the issues. Setsuna had written extensively on the subject, 
crusading to change the minds of the psychological community even as she 
worked to help those with difficulties in coming out or just being out 
of the closet. Michiru dedicated her music to the cause, donating much 
of her profits and writing anthems as well as painting works depicting 
themes of gay and lesbian love. When both polygamy and gay marriage had 
been legalized recently, they leapt at the chance to finally marry.

&#39;I think I have one of Michiru&#39;s erotic prints up in my bedroom,&#39; Minako 
recalled. &quot;So, we can&#39;t change your mind?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Haruka shook her head no.

&quot;Then with your permission we&#39;d like to attend the wedding,&quot; Hotaru said 
gravely, &quot;as well as review security procedures with the Crystal Palace 
staff.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Haruka said with a nod, &quot;I&#39;ll arrange tickets and pass 
your names on to my security chief, Natsua Sakurada.&quot;

&quot;Natsuna?&quot; Minako visibly paled before shaking herself. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she 
resumed her formal tone, &quot;we&#39;ll contact you if anything new develops.&quot;

Michiru walked them to the door and quietly added, &quot;Thank you for your 
help, officers. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll feel much better having you two around.&quot;

&quot;Just doing our jobs, ma&#39;am,&quot; Hotaru said gravely.

The two women walked over to their waiting unmarked car, Minako 
reflexedly taking the driver&#39;s side as Hotaru took the passenger&#39;s seat. 
&quot;The chief is not going to like this,&quot; Minako predicted as she started 
the car, putting it in gear and pulling out into the quiet suburban 
street.

&quot;No, she isn&#39;t,&quot; Hotaru agreed. She looked at Minako thoughtfully a 
moment, &quot;Natsuna... that&#39;s the name of your ex-lover?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s her,&quot; Minako agreed, &quot;though I haven&#39;t seen her in years.&quot;

Hotaru hesitated, then the younger agent reached out to squeeze Minako&#39;s 
hand where it rested on the steering wheel. &quot;If there&#39;s anything I can 
do to help, let me know,&quot; she offered softly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Minako smiled. She puffed out a sigh as they drove into the 
urban center of Tokyo itself, &quot;Well, let&#39;s see how annoyed the boss is.&quot;

S.E.N.S.H.I. was based out of a seemingly normal office tower, though 
one with tighter security than most. Identification cards at the front 
desk, swipe-cards and a retina scan to access the S.E.N.S.H.I. floors, 
and even a x-ray scan were all part of the entry procedures. Nodding to 
coworkers they made their way to the chief&#39;s office, down simply 
decorated halls lined with office doors marked with only numerical 
designations for added security.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Usagi Tsukino smiled from her desk, the blonde secretary 
sorting out paperwork efficiently. &quot;She said to go right in,&quot; she nodded 
to the boss&#39; door.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Hotaru nodded.

Rei Hino looked up from her desk, the black haired woman talking on the 
phone in clipped tones. It sounded like she was balling someone out, 
with language that made both ladies pale. Rei was a political 
appointment due to her father being a prominent Senator, but she had 
quickly earned the respect of her subordinates by backing them to the 
hilt and taking no prisoners. Dressed in coal gray she stood out, 
especially with the scarlet tie and white shirt she added, her eyes 
flashing.

&quot;Idiot,&quot; Rei barked, slamming the phone down. She looked up at them and 
snarled, &quot;So what&#39;s the bad news?&quot;

&quot;How do you know it&#39;s bad news?&quot; Minako asked mildly.

Rei sat back with a frown, &quot;You would have told me immediately if it was 
good.&quot;

&quot;We didn&#39;t want to interrupt,&quot; Hotaru said diplomatically, looking 
towards the senior agent.

&quot;The good news is that they&#39;ll let us have agents at the wedding,&quot; 
Minako said with a wry smile, &quot;the bad is that they are not changing the 
wedding date.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Rei scowled. She looked irritable, &quot;And this is happening 
right before the Prime Ministerial elections, too...&quot; Shaking that off 
she said, &quot;Gay marriage has been a flashpoint issue so we need to make 
sure this goes off without a hitch.&quot;

&quot;Can we have additional agents?&quot; Minako asked, already considering the 
security issues.

&quot;Give me a list of the specialties you need and I&#39;ll try to fill &#39;em,&quot; 
Rei said briskly, &quot;but no promises. We&#39;re stretched pretty thin right 
now with the whole uproar over the disappearance of the Finance 
Minister.&quot;

&quot;Have they confirmed how much he ran off with?&quot; Hotaru looked curious.

&quot;Well over five million,&quot; Rei sighed. She pressed the intercom, &quot;Usagi, 
could you get me some coffee, please?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the cheery voice replied.

Minako offered a salute, &quot;We&#39;ll report in when we have more progress.&quot;

&quot;Good hunting,&quot; Rei wished them as Usagi walked by them into the office, 
her short dress hugging a slim but beautiful body.

As the door was closing they heard Usagi squeak, &quot;Rei! Not now...&quot;

Hotaru blinked at Minako, who just grinned as she firmly shut the office 
door. &quot;Trust me,&quot; she said as they walked out to the office, &quot;I don&#39;t 
want to know.&quot;</pre>
