<h1>Mistaken Assumption (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/misass-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>She knew that Nat had a cable modem; there was no way for her to get  
disconnected unless she did it herself. 

&quot;But Nat wouldn&#39;t do that!&quot; she said aloud as her mind formulated 
another  reason. 

&#145;Maybe the instant messenger server dissed her,&#39; Ami smiled as this 
solution  made more sense to her.  &#145;I&#39;ll just wait till she comes 
back&#39; she thought as  she set her messenger to alert her of when Nat 
came back and returned to her  work.  

Though, at 3:30Am Nat still hadn&#39;t returned and Ami was ready for bed.  
She  didn&#39;t know what happened to Nat and was too tired to ponder why 
she didn&#39;t  come back.  &#145;Thank goodness tomorrow is Saturday, I don&#39;t 
think I have the  energy to deal with classes,&#39; she thought as she 
wrote a quick email  explaining what she didn&#39;t get a chance to tell 
Nat earlier that night.   Dreams of a mysterious phantom lover called 
Nat inundated her mind even  before Sleep consumed her.  

Ami was untimely ripped from sleep by about four hours.  Looking at her  
alarm she wondered who would call her at 5 am in morning. 

&quot;Hello. Mizuno Ami speaking.&quot; 

&quot;Oh! Hello Ami, it&#39;s Mamoru.  Sorry to call so early, I apologize if I 
woke  you.&quot; 

Ami didn&#39;t have to ask, she knew why Mamoru called. 

&quot;Is it time?&quot; she asked anyway. 

&quot;No, even better she&#39;s here&quot; Mamoru relayed with pride. 

&quot;What?&quot; 

Mamoru chuckled before answering, it wasn&#39;t often that you&#39;d catch Ami  
confused. 

&quot;We thought it was a false alarm, so we didn&#39;t call anyone. Then by the 
time  we realized it was the real thing, it was too late.&quot; 

At Ami&#39;s silence Mamoru went on.  &quot;I know you have a life and 
obligations  Ami, but I&#39;m wondering if you can come and see Usagi, 
it&#39;ll mean a lot to  her.&quot;  

Ami was still surprised from hearing that Chibi Usa had been born. 
&#39;Usagi  and Mamoru must be so proud and ecstatic&#39; she thought.  Ami did 
plan on  going to see them next week.  It would be the first time she 
wouldd lay eyes  on them in almost eight years, since she moved away to 
go to high school.  She missed her old friends dearly and didn&#39;t want 
to pass up the chance to  see them. 

&quot;I&#39;ll get the next train over there!&quot; Ami stated as she threw back the  
covers. &quot;Which hospital?&quot;   

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Four and a half hours later Ami walked into the cheerfully decorated 
private  hospital room.  All eyes in the room turned to acknowledge the 
newcomer.  Even though all were brimming with happiness at seeing her 
and none more  happier than the blue pair that belonged to the woman on 
the bed, she  couldn&#39;t help but feel a little self-conscious.  &quot;Hello 
everyone&quot; she said  looking at faces she hadn&#39;t seen in so long.  She 
hugged everyone in turn;  first Makoto, although she wore a smile the 
look in Makoto&#39;s eyes told Ami a  different story.  She wondered why 
Makoto was so sad on such a wonderful  day.  Her worrying increased 
twofold when she saw a similar look of pain in  Rei&#39;s eyes, but she too 
was trying to hide it behind a smile. 

&#145;I wonder what&#39;s wrong with them.  Hope nothing is wrong with Chibi 
Usa,&#39;  but that line of thought was eradicated with one look at Usagi&#39;s 
smiling  face.  

Usagi flung her arms wide open and greeted her friend, &quot;Ami!!!.&quot;  

As Ami embraced her childhood friend she momentarily forgot about the  
sadness of the other women. 

The rest of the afternoon was spent picking up where they left off, 
just  being friends and enjoying each others company.  Though it did 
seem strange  to be together again without Minako, who couldn&#39;t be 
there until Monday,  they did have fun.   

After seeing Usagi at the Hospital the three women returned to she and  
Mamoru&#39;s house.  Space was tight, there were only two guest rooms now 
that  the third was turned into Chibi Usa&#39;s, but the women didn&#39;t mind 
doubling  up, Minako would stay with Rei if she came while all were 
there.  They were  old friends and they knew how to stay respectable. 

&quot;That&#39;s the third time since we got here that you&#39;ve checked you&#39;re 
email  Ami,&quot; Rei stated as Ami came back into the livingroom &quot;Why don&#39;t 
you just  call him?&quot; she teased.  

&quot;Call who?&quot; Ami asked as she sat on the couch next to Rei.  

&quot;The guy you&#39;re waiting for an email from&quot; she said giving Ami the &#145;I 
know  I&#39;m right so don&#39;t even try denying it&#39; look.  

Ami felt how her face got hot as the blood rushed to it.  She knew she 
must  have resembled a tomato and felt a great amount of chagrin as she 
saw Rei&#39;s  look turn to triumph.  

&quot;So tell me about him Ami,&quot; Rei was so excited she turned totally 
towards  Ami and tucked her legs under her, &quot;who is the guy that 
finally swept you  off your feet.&quot;  

&quot;Don&#39;t get ahead of yourself Rei, its not what you think.&quot; &#145;Though you 
don&#39;t  know how close you are&#39; Ami thought as she said &quot;I&#39;m not waiting 
for a guy  to email me.&quot;  She had never told any of her old friends of 
her orientation,  actually Ami never told anyone but her mother.  She 
was apprehensive of what  some people may think if they knew, but the 
didn&#39;t bother her much.  She  mostly thought it was no ones business.  

Silence engulfed the room as the two women stared at each other.  Ami 
didn&#39;t  know what was going through Rei&#39;s mind.   A moment later Rei&#39;s 
eyes flashed  a look of understanding, she looked like she wanted to 
say something but  thought better of it and looked over at Makoto.  Ami 
followed suit, she  fought for breath as the sight of Makoto captivated 
her.  

Makoto was slouched on the arm chair to the left of them with her legs  
crossed and propped up on the coffee table.  Her head leaned slightly 
on her  right shoulder.  The steady movement of her chest and closed 
eyes were signs  of her nocturnal state.  They were all in sleep wear 
and Makoto looked ever  so comfortable in her short ladies boxers and 
loose T-shirt.  Ami&#39;s eyes  devoured every inch of Makoto, starting 
from her unpolished toenails, to her  sexy legs, perfect hips, and 
slender waist, when she reached Makoto&#39;s  unhindered breast her gaze 
lingered.  

As she stared, she remembered her childhood crush on Makoto, judging 
from  her interest obviously it never went away.  She recalled their 
study session  where she would sit for hours and just stare at Makoto.  
Everyone was  studying, in between Usagi&#39;s various complaints, and 
thought she was too.   But Ami had acquired excellent peripheral vison 
from reading and paying  attention to what went on around her.  She 
also had a good sense of  priority, which usually kept her head in the 
books while high antic episodes  involving mostly Usagi and Rei 
occured.  As she pondered her crush she felt  a pang of jealousy at 
whoever held Makoto&#39;s heart now, Ami suspected that a  woman that sexy 
was surly taken.  She battled with a twinge of betrayal as  Nat came to 
mind.  However, Ami couldn&#39;t help it, she hoped that Nat was  half as 
attractive as Makoto.  She also hoped that she lived up to Nat&#39;s  
expectations when they finally meet.  

Her roaming eyes finally made there way to Makoto&#39;s sleeping face.  Her  
attention turned from admiration to concern when she saw the frown 
Makoto  wore.  She then remembered the sadness in her eyes earlier, and 
again  wondered about the cause.     

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto spotted her sitting on a far bench on the platform, her legs 
propped  up by her large overnight bag.  

&#145;Perfect&#39; she thought as she walked around to sneak up behind the  
unsuspecting girl.  

&quot;Don&#39;t turn around&quot; she whispered in a disguised voice.  One side of 
her  lips curled as she saw the women go ridged.   &quot;Just pass whatever 
cash you  have back here and everything will be fine.&quot; Though her smirk 
went away once  the woman broke out in uncontrollable laughter then 
stood up and faced  Makoto.   &quot;Mako, what in the world are you doing?&quot; 
she sobered just a little  to say &quot;that was NOT funny.&quot;  

Makotot looked a bit sheepish as she realize it really wasn&#39;t, but it 
seemed  a good idea at the time.  But still, &quot;why are you laughing if 
its not  funny?&quot;  

By then the woman had sobered completely.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t laughing at you&#39;re  
prank&quot; she said sternly, &quot;I was laughing at the fact that you probably  
thought _you_ could scare me.  It&#39;ll never happen&quot; the woman said as 
she  poked Makoto in chest.  Makoto captured her hand at the forth 
poke. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m  sorry Makoto&quot; she said as she realized her impropriety.   
Makoto just held  her hand and smiled, &quot;there&#39;s no reason to be sorry 
Ami, you just made my  day.&quot;  

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad&quot; Ami smiled &quot;what are you doing here anyway?&quot; 

&quot;I was two blocks down the road after I dropped you off when I realized 
you  probably want some company,&quot; Makoto smiled coyly.  &quot;I know how 
boring it is  to wait alone for...&quot;  &#145;Just about everything&#39; &quot;the 
train.&quot;  

Both women turned to the train as sounds of its approach elevated. 

&quot;Is that you&#39;re ride?&quot; Makoto asked. 

&quot;Yeah! I&#39;m sorry you wasted your time coming back here&quot; her face 
reflected  her sorrow. 

&quot;Ami, I told you.&quot; Makoto beamed a 300 watt smile at her &quot;coming back 
here  made my day.&quot; 

She quickly hugged her friend and gave her a gentle push backwards, 
&quot;you  better get on that train.&quot;   

Driving home she reveled in Ami&#39;s words, &#145;I was laughing at the fact 
that  you probably thought _you_ could scare me.  It&#39;ll never happen.&#39;  
Though her  cheerful mood was threatened by one question swirling 
around in her mind  &#145;Why couldn&#39;t Azure think that way?&#39;   

-------------- 

A/n--if u didn&#39;t get why Rei&#39;s upset, it&#39;s bc she has a thing for Usagi 
and  Chibi Usa&#39;s birth is just another reminder of the future they 
won&#39;t have  together. </pre>
