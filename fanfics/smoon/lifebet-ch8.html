<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The Senshi stood there stunned and terrified. Darien was the first to 
move. 

&#147; God Dammit!&#148; He pounded the Earth with his fists. Tears streaming 
from everyone&#146;s cheeks. They stood there for 10 minutes. Serena 
finally ordering those who did not live at the Mansion to grab clothes 
and meet them there.

Rei ran to her room, grabbing stuff then shoving it in a bag. She 
scribbled a note to her Grandfather saying she was staying at the 
Mansion. Adding for him not to call. Still crying like mad she 
teleported to the Mansion. Rei dropped her stuff on her bed and walked 
to the living room. Each person was comforting another. Rei sat next 
to Hotaru. The 16 year old was in a gloomy daze.

&#147; What now? Dradian will obviously turn her against us.&#148; Rei looked at 
the group.

&#147; How? Terri&#146;s mind is to strong to break.&#148; Mina again looked confused

&#147; That black stone was called Nemkisk. Terri&#146;s only weakness. It will 
leave her mind vulnerable long enough for it to be poisoned.&#148; Setsuna 
stopped speaking, pulling the blonde closer to her. Rei looked down. A 
fresh batch of tears falling. Hotaru noticed and hugged the woman who 
was close enough to be her sister. 

Everyone then went back upstairs to *sleep*. No one, especially Rei, 
would be sleeping. Rei grabbed a robe and decided to explore the 
Mansion. She studied each door. Ami&#146;s, who was across from her, was 
the same as the rest. Planet color &amp; sign, but something was 
different. Down in the right corner was a green sign of Jupiter. - 
Strange&#133;- She looked at Lita&#146;s door. In the same place was a blue sign 
of Mercury. After examining the other doors, Rei figured out the 
reason. 

- Sign of their loved ones. Terri you are clever.- Remembering her 
love for the other girl, Rei looked at her own door. Sure enough there 
was the sign of Terrestrial in the bottom right corner. An evergreen 
five-point star over lapped with a periwinkle star, both outlined with 
black. 

- Terri&#133;what did you mean by I would know what to do?- Rei decided to 
let sleep take over and went back to her bedroom.

A week later it was made clear they were in for a losing streak. There 
had been an attack at the park. Unfortunately what was waiting for 
them was not a youma. A young woman with long chestnut hair and big 
brown eyes to match. She wore a small navy blue tank top that showed 
her stomach and a matching short skirt. Black knee-high boots and a 
staff with a sharp point at the end completed the look. 

The Senshi stood in shock. There floated their beloved Terri. Evil or 
good, she was still every man&#146;s desire. A smirk they would come to 
know was on her face. She flew down to them. It was then that the 
dragon wings sprouting from her back were noticed. 

&#147; Good evening, you must be the Sailor Scouts my Lord wish&#146;s me to 
destroy.&#148;

&#147; Yes but Terrestria, you&#146;ve been brainwashed.&#148; Sailor Moon had 
stepped forward, happy to see her friend, evil or not. 

&#147; I am sorry Miss Moon. You are mistaken, I am Cathena , Goddess of 
Corruption.&#148; The woman&#146;s eyes were hard and cold, showing no emotion. 

&#147; I am here to battle you. We shall do this my way, unless you want a 
whole building of innocents killed.&#148; They nodded in agreement.

&#147; I will fight Pluto first.&#148; The time Senshi stepped forward. The evil 
smirk back on her face, Cathena easily blocked Pluto&#146;s time spears. 
She flew upward and stopped. With in a second her staff had embedded 
itself in the Earth. The words that came from her mouth shocked them 
considerably. &#147; Time Corruption!&#148;. Faces of terror froze as the staff 
did as commanded. A small laugh and Cathena waved a slender hand at 
Pluto, unfreezing her. Cathena bound the woman&#146;s limbs to her sides 
with her energy and floated the green haired woman to herself. She 
grabbed Pluto by the throat and called for her staff.

&#147; So shocked yet Pluto?&#148;

&#147; Probably enough to satisfy you.&#148;

Cathena smiled and let time move again. The others looked up, their 
faces twisted into shock once again. Again using her energy, Cathena 
moved Pluto so the end of the staff touched her upper chest.

&#147; This Senshi is my power!&#148; She looked at Pluto, then thrust the end 
of the staff into the other woman. As Pluto screamed in pain she 
glowed garnet and her sailor uniform was sucked into the staff. Along 
with her powers. Cathena laughed as the defeated sailor fell to Earth 
in human form. Venus immediately catching her. 

&#147; She&#146;s alive, so don&#146;t think me a murderer. There&#146;s no need to kill a 
mere human. I&#146;ll let you decide who I fight next time. Until then!&#148; 
The woman disappeared then. 

With out worry they quickly teleported so Ami could check Setsuna.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setsuna was awake by the time Ami had finished.

&#147; Well your absolutely fine, but there&#146;s no sign of sailor energy 
anywhere.&#148; Ami left Mina and Setsuna alone. Her and the others went 
down stairs. 

&#147; I can&#146;t believe this.&#148; Serena was overwhelmed. Along with everyone 
else. One Senshi turned evil and stealing their powers. Rei left the 
group for the weight room. All she wanted to do was kick the hell out 
of Dradian, but the punching bag would do. - Terri&#133;what am I supposed 
to know?!?- A week later Cathena showed up and was ready for another 
Senshi to fight.</pre>
