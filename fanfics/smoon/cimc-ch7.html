<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Perhaps, my darling, it is time for me to return to you...&quot;

&quot;I can fare on my own, thank you very much.&quot;

&quot;I think I shall...visit anyway.&quot;

&quot;Then...I will be ready...it will end soon...&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&quot;I know that I cannot be forgiven for my sins on this mortal earth. How 
dare you play God and judge me now...&quot;~Maru
 
Rei bit her lip, staring at the door that would grant her entrance into 
Usagi--no-- Serenity&#146;s chamber. She hesitated for a while, occasionally 
raking her fingers through her hair, until Hotaru cleared her throat 
from behind her. Rei turned to the impossibly pale youth, frowning in 
disdain. The small girl returned the expression, her lilac eyes glinting 
in tightly reined annoyance.
 
&quot;Are you going?&quot; The girl asked, moving from her right foot to her left 
impatiently, waiting for a response.
 
&quot;Yeah I&#146;m going!&quot; Rei shouted, glaring at the small girl. &quot;I&#146;ve never 
had a meeting with a vampire before, so excuse me if I&#146;m a little 
cautious, ok?! Go and suck the blood from a cat or something, you creepy 
little freak you!&quot; Hotaru&#146;s eyes widened in shock, and if her face could 
have colored from rage, it would have. Baring her fangs at the 
detective, she gave her a firm push into Serenity&#146;s quarters, so 
powerful that Rei&#146;s body was used to open the door instead of her hands, 
which is what she would&#146;ve preferred. Instead, she landed at a rather 
uncomfortable angle on the cool marble floor of the chamber, looking up 
quickly as the door shut behind her, leaving her enveloped in an eerie, 
inky, black darkness.
 
From behind the door, she heard a giggle.
 
Rei cursed.
 
&quot;Such language...are you alright? I hope Hotaru didn&#146;t hurt you.&quot; A 
chuckle. &quot;She doesn&#146;t know her own strength sometimes, I&#146;m afraid.&quot;

Rei stood up slowly, rubbing her neck without thinking. &quot;Um...Miss 
Tsukino, is that you?&quot;
 
Another soft chuckle floated through the room, reverberating off the 
walls. &quot;Why yes. This is my chamber, after all. Is it too dark for you? 
I had forgotten that our kind does require so much light.&quot; Before Rei 
could open her mouth to say yes, Serenity clapped her hands, and soon 
the room was enveloped in soft white light.

Rei could finally get a good look at the other woman, and she was once 
again mesmerized by how beautiful she was...it was almost alien.
 
In fact, Rei was quite sure it was alien. Serenity had opted for a 
change of clothes, and now, she was wearing a long silk white dress that 
was translucent enough to be considered a nightgown of sorts, and it had 
obviously been made to fit her svelte frame. Her hair was once again in 
her trademark odangos, and she was wearing a diamond necklace with a 
cross hanging from it. The rose tattoo seemed to pop out against her 
porcelain skin, and she gave Rei a brief smile. Rei noticed that her 
face was void of almost any color, and she suddenly felt very ill at 
ease.
 
&quot;Hello Miss Hino. I&#146;m very glad you decided to come. Please, come with 
me.&quot; Serenity stood from the throne, and turned on her heel, walking 
toward another door.
 
Rei blinked. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;
 
Serenity did not answer.
 
Rei sighed in exasperation, and followed the woman to the other room, 
still absentmindedly rubbing her neck.
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Kazuki had forgotten how simple it was to move throughout Serenity&#146;s 
mansion. It was an easy enough process...she smiled...hopefully, she could 
find that idiotic little detective and leave without running into any of 
her old...&quot;colleagues.&quot;  
 
&quot;Angel?&quot;
 
Damn, Kazuki thought, turning to face the last person she wanted to meet 
in this place.
 
&quot;Yes, Setsie?&quot;

Setsuna frowned immediately, blowing a strand of forest-green hair away 
from her face. &quot;How many times...&quot; she started, watching Kazuki&#146;s frown 
morph into a very self-satisfied smirk.
 
&quot;You started it; I&#146;ve told you a million times that I&#146;m as far from an 
angel as you are from a saint.&quot;
 
Setsuna&#146;s frown melted into a sad smile. &quot;You&#146;re my angel.&quot;
 
Kazuki rolled her eyes. &quot;Oh, the dramatics...spare me Setsuna.&quot;
 
Setsuna sighed weakly. &quot;You never were romantic...I do wonder how I was 
stupid enough to fall for such a cold, heartless, insufferable, 
angst-filled, sad little being such as yourself.&quot;
 
Kazuki shrugged. &quot;My dashing good looks...and besides, it&#146;s not my fault 
you&#146;re an idiot.&quot;
 
&quot;And it isn&#146;t my fault you&#146;re a self-absorbed little twit.&quot;
 
&quot;I never asked you to fall in love with me, you old hag.&quot;
 
&quot;Who fell in love with you? If I recall, you were the one running around 
after me, trying so hard to be the nonchalant, apathetic woman you claim 
to be, when in reality, all you are is a hormonal driven child!&quot;
 
&quot;Someone&#146;s losing their cool. And my dear, dear Setsie, you fell in love 
with me. I&#146;m quite good at winning over people.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, spare me your enormous ego, my precious little angel. Why in the 
world are you here...oh yes, I remember. Where is the fanfare, my 
misinformed beloved?&quot;
 
There was a pause.
 
&quot;...Beloved...?&quot;
 
Setsuna sighed, feeling a flare of embarrassment in the pit of her 
stomach.
 
&quot;Yes, you silly little girl, you&#146;re my beloved.&quot; She moved to embrace 
the other woman, and was quite satisfied when she did not pull away. She 
rolled her eyes, and ran her fingers through Kazuki&#146;s mane of black 
hair, for a moment, simply content with the feel of the other woman&#146;s 
heartbeat against her own.
 
&quot;Setsuna...&quot;

&quot;Mmm? What is it?&quot;

&quot;The detective...Hino is in here somewhere. I have to find her...Serenity is 
going to do something horrible to her...I am fine with the idea of her 
wanting to protect us...but this...I believe she&#146;s losing her grip on 
reality...she&#146;s become quite...sadistic, don&#146;t you think? The woman is only 
doing her job.&quot;
 
Setsuna frowned. &quot;If I didn&#146;t know any better, I&#146;d think you fancied 
that mortal. What&#146;s gotten into you? And that woman is putting our 
entire race in grave danger.&quot;
 
Kazuki&#146;s head snapped up, and she glared at Setsuna.
 
&quot;What in God&#146;s name are you rambling on about? Fancy her? What a stupid 
thing to say when you&#146;re holding me...have you lost your tact?&quot;
 
Setsuna sighed and nuzzled Kazuki&#146;s neck, occasionally nibbling on her 
delicate skin, causing soft shivers to run up and down the woman&#146;s 
spine.
 
&quot;What did I say about fancying the mortal? I must have had a lapse in 
sanity, my love. It&#146;s just that,&quot; she rained kisses up and down Kazuki&#146;s 
neck as she spoke, &quot;I&#146;ve missed you so...I was a little jealous...forgive 
me?&quot;
 
Kazuki shivered once more, gently tugging on Setsuna&#146;s shirt. 
&quot;Mmhmm...yes, forgiven, right...where was your room again, darling? I&#146;ve 
forgotten,&quot; she sighed so deeply, that it almost sounded like a purr, 
&quot;and we need to go there... now. I&#146;ve missed you too, you know.&quot;
 
Setsuna grinned, her face still hidden in the nape of Kazuki&#146;s neck.
 
&quot;Well, best not to keep you waiting then, hmm love?&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Rei shuffled on the soft, pale rose-colored lounging couch, watching 
Serenity take a seat on the very large four poster bed, which shared the 
same color scheme, across from her.
 
&quot;I suppose you want answers.&quot;

Rei nodded her head, slipping into a more professional tone.
 
&quot;Yes. First off, I&#146;d like to know about these murders. Know anything 
about them, Miss Tsukino?&quot;
 
Serenity took a deep breath. &quot;I suppose I should start...from the 
beginning...&quot;
 
&quot;I have been called by many names, but the first was Serenity. I was a 
young commoner, who had the &quot;good fortune&quot; of being wed to a very rich 
count somewhere...France, I believe. I lived in England, at the time. We 
met...later on, when I was about 20. I suppose he had known my mother, and 
he had this wedding planned since I was quite young. My mother told me 
he was quite handsome, but I did not care in the slightest. I simply 
wanted to stay with her. ...Well, it came the day that we were to meet. I 
traveled to France with only the clothes on my back. Finally, after much 
journeying, I arrived at my betrothed&#146;s chateau. I was...quite surprised 
when he greeted me at the door. I expected him to be quite old by then, 
but when I met him...by the gods, he was handsome. His hair was short and 
white...his eyes...they sparkled so brightly...a fascinating mix between 
light blue, lilac, and pale green...his face, so beautiful...and I know that 
is odd to call him by such a name, but it is true...he was...beautiful.&quot;
 
&quot;I did not notice his sickly pallor, the way his eyes seemed to glow...I 
was a stupid little girl.&quot;
 
Re remained quiet, taking in the nostalgic look on the other woman&#146;s 
face.
 
&quot;He spoke with a rich English accent...he had a wonderful tenor voice. He 
said his name was Demando...and that he was born in England, but later 
moved to France. Everything...seems like a blur....I remember our wedding 
night most of all though.&quot;
 
&quot;I will never forget that night.&quot;
 
&quot;I had noticed that the count was never seen during the day, but I had 
assumed he was out...on business. The servants would give him odd looks 
when he came home at night...he rarely ate, but I took little notice of 
this, since I was too consumed with my own dining,&quot; she laughed a 
little, &quot;and of course I had noticed his pale skin, but I dismissed it.&quot;
 
&quot;But on our wedding night, it all became clear. As expected, we were 
to...consummate our marriage...&quot;
 
Rei&#146;s eyes widened. &quot;...Did he rape you?&quot;
 
Serenity&#146;s eyes widened as well, and she laughed. &quot;Oh heavens no! Good 
Lord, Miss Hino, of course not!&quot;
 
Rei blinked. &quot;Then what did he do?&quot;
 
She watched Serenity&#146;s eyes darken.
 
&quot;It is called tainting. I...ran...the forests were so dark...but he was so 
much faster...vampiric speed you see...&quot;
 
She could hear it...tearing through the forest...after her...

&quot;It was so...cold in that forest. I ran as fast as my legs could take me, 
but he was right behind me.&quot;

&quot;I knew death was near, and I was afraid. For some absurd reason, I 
wanted my mother.&quot;

&quot;I was...so frightened...&quot; Rei heard Serenity&#146;s voice waver. &quot;And then, he 
was there, his breath on my neck...holding me close...a true lover&#146;s 
embrace.&quot;

And as quick as lightning...it was upon her, sinking its teeth into the 
skin on her beautiful neck...and like music, the blood sung in its veins... 
her blood...their blood...

&quot;It...hurt for a moment...his teeth...fangs, rather, were like tiny little 
needles, tearing into my throat.&quot;

Tainted...forever...the two of them...for all eternity..

As she slumped to her knees, he whispered sweet nothings into her ear. 
&quot;My sweet, innocent Serenity...I promise, it will be better now...you and I 
together...forever...won&#146;t that be nice?&quot;

Her eyes became unfocused, and she focused on the brightest thing in the 
sky she could see. The moon shone brightly down upon them, and she was 
briefly amazed at how beautiful it must&#146;ve looked...to a passerby, it 
would look two lovers embraced beneath the silver light of the moon.

And then she died.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Ami Mizuno smiled weakly to herself. She had made it in...glorious...and no 
vampires in sight.

&quot;Excuse me, but what are you doing here?&quot;

Ami turned around slowly to face a slightly annoyed looking Makoto, with 
an excited Hotaru standing behind her.

&quot;Hello Miss Kino,&quot; she whispered weakly, wondering if the vampire in 
question would like her blood chilled, from the vein, or used as a sauce 
to saut&eacute; something.

She had been a chef, after all.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Setsuna giggled softly, which turned into a gasp, and then a soft moan. 
She was not quite sure what she had been thinking before Kazuki tore off 
her shirt and began the deliciously slow act of teasing her nipples with 
that brilliant tongue of hers, but she supposed it hadn&#146;t been 
important.

Oh, and now the tongue in question was moving southward. Setsuna smiled 
a very big smile. 

Life was VERY good.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;I have lived for 1000 years hence, Miss Hino, and I will live even 
longer still. Those girls you met...women...they are my children, and we are 
forever bound. Demando...my life mate...our ties have severed...I no longer 
feel his thoughts well at all...&quot;

&quot;I am a vampire, and the murders...my children and I have caused them...I 
am...sorry.&quot;

Rei stood still, shaking her head. &quot;You&#146;re...a vampire...you caused all 
this.&quot;

Serenity seemed eerily calm. &quot;It was meant to be...written in the 
stars...just as my curse is my fate, so is our meeting...we are meant to be 
here...together.&quot;

Rei frowned. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

Serenity smiled at her, and snapped her fingers, and all at once, every 
muscle in Rei&#146;s body seemed to tense. She walked unsteadily over to 
Serenity, and the woman snapped her fingers again, causing Rei to fall 
on the bed next to her.&quot;

Serenity helped her up, and moved close to her, their faces almost 
touching...so close.

&quot;Tonight, my dear Rei, you and I will become as Demando and I were years 
ago...&quot;

&quot;But tonight, I will be the one making the rules....and you will enjoy 
every moment of it...my precious star-crossed lover...&quot;
