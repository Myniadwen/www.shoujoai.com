&quot;No! Absolutely, positively, not! En oh no!&quot;

&quot;Ruka...&quot; I say to my love in exasperation.

&quot;You&#39;re not getting me in there! I know you, Michi. As soon as you get 
me in there, I know exactly what you&#39;ll do.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; I ask, stepping close to her and taking her arm. &quot;And what, 
exactly, would I do?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll try to get me into one of those...those things!&quot; she protested, 
not noticing that I was slowly leading her forward.

&quot;But...but you always like it when I wear one of them.&quot; I pout, trying 
to not let her know how close to victory I was.

&quot;But that&#39;s you, Michi.&quot; she looks at me tenderly, so much so that I 
almost give away my game.

&quot;But Ruka...&quot; I plead, giving her a &#39;puppy dog eye&#39; look.

&quot;No, Michi. I won&#39;t. Not even for you.&quot; she says as she pulls her arm 
away from me and stormed off, leaving me alone on the threshold of the 
lingerie shop.

As I watch my lover walk off, I can&#39;t help but stomping my foot in 
irritation. I love Haruka dearly, I truly do, but sometimes her 
attitudes frustrate me to no end. I understand that since before I met 
her she&#39;s been trying to fit into the male-dominated racing circuit and 
that she is a lesbian in a society that frowns on such lifestyles. For 
years, she&#39;s been mimicking male attitudes and mannerisms to the point 
that they were second nature to her; but sometimes she takes it too 
far...to my disappointment. I mean, I&#39;m also a lesbian, but I&#39;ve never 
felt that I had to hide behind a false mask.

But whenever I could pull that mask from her, a dramatic change takes 
place. On those rare occasions I&#39;ve been able to convince her to dress 
femininely, she transforms into an extremely beautiful and sensual 
creature.

&quot;You know...&quot; I hear Minako say from my side. Looking over at her, I 
see her wearing a conspiratorial grin. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you 
knew &#39;all&#39; of her measurements.&quot; her grin grew wider, &quot;I&#39;m thinking 
that she would look good in something...risqu&eacute; in a powder-blue. Or 
maybe a silk negligee in black.&quot;

&quot;Velvet.&quot; I think out loud, returning Minakos&#39; grin. &quot;Haruka enjoys the 
feel of velvet.&quot;

I glance around and look at the others. Today is the first full day of 
our vacation and last night we all agreed to put off going to the beach 
until after the weekend; when it wouldn&#39;t be as crowded. So, we decided 
to go to the nearby open-air mall to do a little shopping. I smile as I 
notice my daughter and Chibi-usa looking in one of the lingerie shops&#39; 
windows with a mix of curiosity and awe; remembering when I was at that 
age and such clothing became fascinating to me.

&quot;Come on, Rei! I want to find something to wear for my Mamo-chan!&quot; 
Usagi exclaimed, dragging the raven-haired girl behind her.

&quot;Stop pulling, Usagi...&quot; Rei said, shaking her head in exasperation.

&quot;Hey, Mako-chan! Let&#39;s go help Michiru-san pick something out for 
Haruka-san!&quot; Minako said, grabbing the taller girls arm and pulling her 
into the shop.

&quot;But...but I...&quot; the brunette stammered.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry Mako-chan. We&#39;ll find something for you too!&quot;

Glancing at the two remaining members of our group, I can&#39;t help but 
smile in amusement at seeing Ami looking like she would die from 
embarrassment. Setsuna, meanwhile, is looking at the displays in the 
windows with the critical eye of a clothing designer. Apparently 
sensing my regard, the emerald haired woman met my eyes with a 
questioning gaze. I motion towards the two younger girls by the window 
with my head and she nods, telling me that she will look after them 
while I was inside.

Once inside the lingerie store, I&#39;m quickly caught up in the variety of 
selections available. While searching through the racks, I can&#39;t help 
chuckling softly at the antics of the other girls with me; especially 
Usagi and Minako. The two blondes kept finding items of clothing that 
they would hold up against Rei and Makoto and try to convince them to 
try on. At seeing some of the selections the two would pick, my mind 
would occasionally wander; especially when Usagi pulled out an 
extremely revealing red number and insisted that Rei try it on.

Perhaps, I reflect, it was a good thing that Haruka wasn&#39;t here after 
all.

After selecting an item to try on, I move to the changing rooms. While 
I was completed dedicated to Haruka; and she to me; I would be blind 
not to notice how beautiful the other Senshi were. Rei with her long 
legs, Minako with her tight butt, Setsuna with her captivating eyes, 
Usagi with her sensual lips, Makoto with her voluptuous body, and 
Ami...to be honest, if it weren&#39;t for Haruka I would probably go after 
the blue haired girl.

&#39;Of course, unlike Haruka, I&#39;m not tempted to sneak a peak at them 
while they&#39;re changing.&#39; I think, watching as Usagi practically shoved 
Rei into one of the stalls with that red number. &#39;Well...at least I 
wouldn&#39;t be tempted to act on that impulse.&#39;

Entering one of the stalls, I remove my sundress and lacy underwear and 
begin to carefully slip on my selection. It was a foam green corset 
that laced up in the front with matching crotchless panties. Looking at 
myself in the mirror, I run my hands along my sides and decide that I 
would buy it if I could find a matching set of stockings and garter 
belt to go along with it. I knew I already had a pair of high heels I 
had packed that would complement the outfit perfectly. I frown suddenly 
and tap my chin in thought...something was missing. Glancing at my 
hand, I grin when I realize that what was needed to make this outfit 
complete would be a pair of elbow length gloves; something I remember 
seeing by the front counter.

&#39;Poor, poor Haruka.&#39; I think with a savage grin. &#39;She won&#39;t know what 
hit her.&#39;

I change back into my sundress and, with a playful grin, tuck my 
underwear and bra into my purse. Folding up the corset, I&#39;m about to 
leave the stall when I hear a familiar voice mutter something from the 
stall next to me.

&quot;...I wonder what Ami would think...&quot;

&#39;I guess we were right about Makoto.&#39; I think curiously, remembering 
the conversation Minako, Haruka and I had several weeks ago.

I&#39;m about to leave and ignore what I heard when a sudden noise startles 
me.

&quot;ACK! Mina-chan! What are you doing?!&quot; Makoto exclaims; the sound of 
her scrambling for something to cover herself could be heard.

&quot;Oh, I thought I heard something about Ami-chan.&quot; The blonde said, her 
voice sounding odd until I realized she must be in the stall on the 
other side of the brunette and leaning over the wall.

&quot;Mina-chan!&quot; Makoto protested.

&quot;Wow, Mako-chan! You look really hot! But you really should shave down 
there if you&#39;re going to wear that. So, what was that about Ami-chan?&quot; 
the blonde asked, ignoring Makoto&#39;s discomfort.

Makoto shuffles around for a moment before she sighs in resignation. 
&quot;I...I was wondering what Ami would think...&quot; she whispers softly.

It was quiet for a few moments before I heard Minako say sadly, 
&quot;Mako-chan, I...I&#39;m sorry, but Ami-chan is interested in someone else.&quot;

An awkward silence followed before the taller girl said dejectedly, 
&quot;Are...are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yea...&quot; Minako answered quietly, then she brightly said &quot;But if you 
buy that, you&#39;re sure to get any other guy or girl of your choice!&quot;

&quot;Yea...sure...&quot; Makoto replied mournfully.

I remained where I was until I hear Makoto change and exit her stall. I 
can&#39;t help but feel sorry for the brunette, knowing full well what it 
was like to be interested in someone who didn&#39;t return those feelings. 
I realize that since this trip started, Minako had been with the taller 
girl constantly; apparently the blonde had been trying to find a way to 
break the news to her gently.

&#39;I&#39;ll talk to Haruka to see what we can do to help cheer Mako-chan up.&#39; 
I think as I leave my stall in search of the accessories I need to make 
my outfit complete; only to stop when something caught my eye that 
Haruka would look great in.

&#39;But I wonder...who&#39;s the lucky person that Ami-chan likes?&#39;

***********

&quot;Hrumph.&quot; Haruka snorts before taking another drink of her coffee.

I ignore the blonde as she continues to sulk. I&#39;ve never understood 
Harukas&#39; attitude about dressing ladylike. I know for a fact that she 
had a fine collection of feminine clothing. Very feminine clothing. In 
fact, there were several designs that I&#39;ve done that would be perfect 
for someone with her build; it&#39;s just a shame that the few times I&#39;ve 
been able to get her to model for me were the result of blackmail on 
the part of Michiru.

&quot;Hey, everyone! They&#39;re over there! Hi Setsuna-san, Haruka-san!&quot; 
Usagis&#39; voice cuts through the quiet din of the open-air caf&eacute;.

&quot;Hello, Haruka.&quot; Michiru greeted her lover as she approached the table.

&quot;...um, Hi, Michi...&quot; the blonde mutters uncomfortably.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Ruka. I forgive you.&quot; the aquamarine haired woman told 
her lover as she took a seat next to her. She then bent forward to put 
her bags down; giving Haruka, and me incidentally, a view down her 
cleavage and showing that, in the time since we last saw her, her bra 
seemed to have disappeared.

&quot;So, did you buy anything...interesting?&quot; Haruka asked with a lecherous 
smile.

Usagi plopped down in an empty chair at our table with a grin. &quot;Oh yea! 
I bought something special to wear for my Mamo-chan. But, it&#39;s nowhere 
near as daring as what Rei bought! It looked great! But Rei was being a 
stick in the mud and wouldn&#39;t model it for me.&quot; she finished with a 
pout.

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Rei yelled, her face crimson.

&quot;Oh really? Maybe she wants to give you a &#39;private viewing?&quot; Haruka 
asked, her voice dripping with innuendo.

&quot;Really, Rei? Is that what you were planing?&quot; Usagi turned to look at 
the raven-haired girl with wide-eyed innocence.

Reis&#39; face turned purple from embarrassment and she sputtered several 
times. &quot;It...it&#39;s not like that!&quot;

&quot;Like what, Rei?&quot; the ponytailed girl asked, genuinely perplexed.

&quot;Well Koneko-chan, you see...&quot; Haruka started, only to be interrupted 
by an elbow to the ribs from Michiru.

&quot;Never mind! Forget it!&quot; Rei exclaimed, turning around in a huff.

&quot;So where&#39;s everyone else?&quot; Minako asked, coming up to the table with a 
gloomy looking Makoto.

&quot;Ami-san is in the bookstore over there.&quot; I say, motioning to the 
nearby store.

I&#39;m surprised when Makoto looks towards the bookstore with a longing 
sigh. I notice that Haruka casts a questioning glance at Michiru, which 
is returned with a placating gesture. It also seemed that neither Rei 
nor Usagi had recognized the tall brunettes&#39; apparent dark mood, which 
was remarkable; what with both of them being good at reading other 
peoples emotions. Minako, however, noticed and frowned.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s not surprising. Ami-chan could find a book in the middle 
of a desert.&quot; the blonde girl said flippantly. &quot;So where did 
Hotaru-chan and Chibi-usa-chan get off to?&quot;

&quot;Hum? Oh, they&#39;re in the arcade over that way.&quot; Haruka replied.

&quot;Really? There&#39;s an arcade here? Cool! Come on, Mako-chan!&quot; Minako said 
excitedly, pulling the taller girl along with her.

I watched as the brunette gave one last look of longing before allowing 
herself to be dragged away by Minako. &#39;Interesting.&#39; I think, taking a 
sip of my latte &#39;I wonder what&#39;s bothering Makoto? She&#39;s normally full 
of zeal.&#39;

&quot;Hey! Hold on! Wait for us!&quot; Usagi exclaimed as she followed; pulling a 
still red faced Rei along with her.

After the younger girls had left, Haruka turned to Michiru. &quot;Ok, so 
what&#39;s got Mako-chan all depressed?&quot;

Michiru sighs softly. &quot;It seems that Mina-chan and I were right. About 
Makoto-chans&#39; feelings about Ami-chan and vice-versa, that is.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; the blonde asked with interest, while I pretended to not pay 
attention.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Michiru sighed again. &quot;I overheard Mina-chan and Mako-chan 
talking in the changing room. I think that Mako-chan was going to try 
to make her move on Ami-chan this week, but Mina-chan told her that she 
wasn&#39;t interested in her like that.&quot;

I&#39;m torn about how I feel about hearing what happened. Part of me 
wishes that the blonde girl had kept her big mouth shut and let Makoto 
do her thing and sweep Ami off her feet; so I wouldn&#39;t have to worry 
about Ami getting too close to me emotionally. But another part of me; 
that inner voice that seems to be betraying me of late; is cheering, 
saying that I still had a chance...not that I wanted one.

&quot;Darn! That&#39;s too bad. I still think that they would make a cute 
couple.&quot; Haruka stated.

&#39;Of course,&#39; that betraying voice says to me, &#39;you know exactly what 
would happen is she did make her move, don&#39;t you?&#39;

---Silver Millennium---

Do to an invitation by the Queen, I&#39;ve returned to the Lunar Palace a 
day earlier than I had planned. Unfortunately for me, it was for an 
official summons; a Royal Ball no less. While this function was 
important, what with an important Terran delegation present, I truly 
loathed having to attend these functions. So, I searched out young Pai 
so I could at least spend the next few hours in enjoyable conversation 
with her. However, I&#39;ve been looking for her for the last few minutes 
without any sing of her.

&quot;Where are they, you lazy bum?!&quot; I hear an annoyingly familiar voice 
say.

&quot;How am I suppose to know, Luna? Why don&#39;t you calm down? It&#39;s not like 
it&#39;s the end of the universe.&quot; A somewhat familiar voice responds.

&quot;Calm down? Calm Down!? How do you expect me to calm down when the 
Princess and her Senshi have disappeared?&quot;

&quot;Sigh. It&#39;s not like they would go far, you know.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all your fault, Artemis!&quot; I hear the Mau adviser shrilly accuse 
the other cat; and I can&#39;t help raise an eyebrow at hearing that.

&quot;And how do you figure that, Luna?&quot; Artemis asks calmly.

&quot;It&#39;s because of your reprehensible behavior and your influences over 
Lady Shuura that the princess has been acting like she has these past 
few years!&quot;

&quot;I have as much influence over Shuura as you do with the Queen.&quot; 
Artemis patiently replied. &quot;Seriously though, Luna. When was the last 
time you had some time off? You know, a vacation?&quot;

With neither noticing my presence, I quietly leave the two Mau. I&#39;ve 
never liked the self-important attitude that the black cat possessed 
and the only reason she never knew my opinions were because of how 
close she was to my friend. But from what I&#39;ve heard from young Pai, 
Artemis was a good influence on her. Apparently, the general consensus 
around the Palace was that Luna would either learn to mellow out or she 
would end up killing the white Mau and being sent to a mental 
institution.

With the sounds of a full-blown argument brewing behind me, I began 
walking through the halls of the Palace in search of young Pai; 
somewhat curious as to where she was. At the age of 20 young Pai was a 
studious and attentive as ever, so I was slightly concerned that she 
wasn&#39;t already getting ready for tonight. It wasn&#39;t like her to me 
&#39;missing&#39;. In fact, even the Princess and her ever-present companion, 
Myung, had begun to act more responsible of late. Of course, that did 
leave Shuura who, at fifteen, would often act her age.

Eventually I ended up in the Imperial Gardens, where I saw something 
that left me speechless.

Pai...

Rion...

Kissing...

Startled, I quietly slip into the shadows. Watching the two of them, I 
was completely stunned. My Pai had never indicated to me that she was 
interested in the Senshi of Jupiter as anything more than an as a 
friend. In fact, thinking about it, she had never even hinted to me 
that she was romantically inclined towards anyone at all; the subject 
just never came up. Coupling that to the fact that I still blamed Rion 
for my Pais&#39; injuries all those years ago; I didn&#39;t know how I felt.

As I watch, I notice that my Pai is trying to push the taller girl 
away. &#39;That...bitch! How DARE she try to force herself on my Pai!&#39; I 
think, my thoughts going red as the Time Key Staff appeared in my 
hands.

Pai finally pushed away from the brunette and I&#39;m about to launch 
myself at her when her soft, calm voice broke through my rage. 
&quot;Rion...please, don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;But, Pai...&quot; Rion pleaded, &quot;I...I love you. I&#39;ve been in love with you 
for so long now...&quot;

I see young Pai smile sadly before speaking in a melancholy voice. &quot;I 
love you too, Rion.&quot; Seeing the taller girl perk up, she raised a hand 
to quiet her. &quot;But...but I&#39;m not &#39;in&#39; love with you. I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

Rion stood there, her hurt evident. &quot;But...but why?&quot;

Young Pai turned her face towards the ground and I had to strain to 
hear her reply. &quot;There...there&#39;s someone who I...&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Rion said, angrily interrupting her, before seeming to 
collapse in on herself.

The taller girl stood there for a moment before she turned dejectedly 
and began to walk away. &quot;Rion...?&quot; young Pai started to say.

&quot;Not now, Pai. Not now.&quot; the brunette said, not turning around. 
&quot;Give...give me some time, alright.&quot; she finished before walking away 
despondently.

I silently watched over young Pai as she stood there; obviously hurt 
from the pain she caused her friend with her rejection. After a while, 
young Pai walked off in the opposite direction as Rion. Once she was 
gone, I was about to step out of the shadows I&#39;m hiding in when a sharp 
retort sounds throughout the Garden.

To my amazement, I see three figures tumble out of a nearby tree in a 
tangle of blonde and black hair. &quot;Get off of me!&quot; I hear Myung yell 
from beneath the pile of bodies.

&quot;Ouches...&quot; the princess said as she got up in an undignified manner.

Shuura leapt to her feet and grinned at the two older women with 
satisfaction. &quot;See? See? I told you! But you didn&#39;t believe me!&quot; the 
fifteen year old girl said excitedly.

&quot;Poor Rion.&quot; the princess said sadly.

&quot;She&#39;ll be ok.&quot; Myung assured the princess, laying a comforting arm on 
her shoulder. &quot;Rion is strong. She&#39;ll bounce back in no time.&quot;

&quot;Myung? Shouldn&#39;t we do something to help her?&quot; the princess asked.

Grinning wildly Shuura said, &quot;Well, me and Myung could offer to be her 
sex-slaves. I&#39;m sure that that would cheer her up!&quot;

&quot;What?!?&quot; the eighteen year old Senshi of Mars exclaimed, stepping 
closer to the princess reflexively.

Seeing this, I would have been worried if young Pai hadn&#39;t told me that 
while the two young women were still very close, their relationship 
seemed to have cooled off.

&quot;Well, that &#39;would&#39; take her mind off of Pai. Right?&quot; Shuura grinned 
wickedly, causing the princess to giggle.

Snorting in anger, Myung fixed the blonde with a hard gaze. &quot;Alright 
Miss &#39;Goddess of Love&#39;, you were right; I&#39;ll give you that. So tell us, 
who&#39;s this &#39;secret love&#39; that Pai&#39;s interested in?&quot;

The young Senshi of Venus puffed her chest up with confidence and 
raised a finger as if to make an important point. &quot;That&#39;s a secret!&quot; 
she announced; nearly causing the raven haired woman to fall over, &quot;Now 
come on, we gotta get changed for the Ball! I really want to get a good 
look at Prince Eatumup!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Prince Endymion, not &#39;Eatumup&#39;.&quot; Myung corrected irritably.

&quot;Then you obviously haven&#39;t seen any vids of him.&quot; Shuura admonished 
before grinning; &quot;I definitely want to eat-um-up!&quot;

I wait until the three girls leave the Garden before I abandon my 
hiding place. Slowly, I make my way to my quarters in silence. There 
were some things I needed to think about.

---Present Time---

&quot;So, what else happened?&quot; I hear Haruka ask, shaking me from my 
reflections.

&quot;Well not much.&quot; Michiru replied, &quot;As you saw, Mako-chan has been in a 
funk ever since. But Mina-chan did say that Ami-chan was interested in 
someone else though.&quot;

&quot;Oh really? Did she say who?&quot; the blonde asked curiously.

&quot;No she didn&#39;t.&quot; Michiru answered.

&quot;Excuse me.&quot; I say, getting out of my chair and nodding to the two 
lovers.

I make my way to the restroom, doing my best to school my features. 
Once there, I quickly look around to see if anyone else is present. 
Seeing no one, I enter one of the stalls and lock it. Leaning against 
the door heavily, I release a shuddering breath.

&quot;...no...please no...please Kami, please let it not be me...&quot; I plead 
softly.

To Be Continued...

Author&#39;s Notes...
In several e-mails I&#39;ve been asked &#39;Why not Rei and Usagi&#39;? Well to be 
honest, while I think that the two of them do make a good couple, I 
wanted to make a fic in which Tux-But (er...I mean Mamoru) was 
portrayed as a good guy instead of an evil prick. And I&#39;ve yet to have 
read a good fic in which Rei and Usagi were matched together that 
didn&#39;t have an evil SOB Mamoru (unless it had a threesome between 
them). So, I decided to not have them get together in this fic. If you 
don&#39;t like that, then oh well...

As Always any C&amp;C would be appreciated.

This fic and others can be found at my FF.Net account, which is
