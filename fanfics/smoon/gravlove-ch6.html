<h1>Gravity of Love (part 6 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/gravlove-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Serena yawned as she stepped into the living room of Rei&#39;s apartment. 
She hadn&#39;t had such a nice sleep in days. The bed in the guest room was 
much more comfortable than the one in the disgusting motel.

Blue eyes searched around for the assassin, spotting a head of raven 
hair in the kitchen. With a small and timid smile, Serena approached the 
taller woman.

Rei was sitting at the small table, newspaper in her hand as her 
lavender eyes quickly skimmed the page. She seemed to find something of 
interest, still oblivious of the blonde&#39;s presence.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Serena greeted meekly.

The top of the paper flopped away from the reader as mesmerizing eyes 
gazed at the slim figure by the door.

&quot;Morning,&quot; the assassin replied in that drawl of hers.

Despite the circumstances, Rei had expected Serena to be a little more 
relaxed now that they were at her home. But instead, the blonde seemed 
even more hesitant and frightened.

&quot;Come in and eat. Breakfast is on the counter.&quot;

Nervousness disappeared the second the word breakfast was said. Serena 
walked to the counter to see a white take out box. She opened it to find 
pancakes, eggs, hash browns and bacon.

Rei cocked her head slightly to the side when her &quot;guest&quot; remained 
standing at the counter and began to eat. The assassin put down her 
paper and sighed. She wanted to be as comfortable as possible while 
Serena stayed at her home. And for that to happen, the blonde had to be 
comfortable as well.

&quot;This isn&#39;t high school,&quot; the assassin teased with a smirk, &quot;and you 
haven&#39;t done anything wrong. So you don&#39;t have to eat standing. Sit down 
and enjoy breakfast.&quot;

Serena sat down at the table, blushing softly. She remembered how she 
had... teased, her captor last night. And how the taller woman blushed. 
She didn&#39;t even know why she did it. She&#39;s chalking it up to insanity. 
Either way, Rei&#39;s eyes stayed on her until she took a bite of her 
pancakes before returning to her paper.

Guess she didn&#39;t remember or just didn&#39;t care.

&quot;Do you have the same taste in clothing as Minako?&quot;

The blonde thought for a moment before responding. &quot;For the most part, 
why?&quot;

&quot;Because I need to figure out which catalogue to pick up.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Lavender eyes looked up from the paper and settled on the confused 
looking blonde. She turned her attention back to her paper before 
answering.

&quot;You&#39;ll be staying here for a while. You can&#39;t just wear the same 
clothes over and over again. And you certainly won&#39;t fit into a lot of 
my clothes. So, I&#39;m picking up a catalogue for you later to order 
something. Going out to shop would be too risky.&quot;

The blonde&#39;s eyes never left the assassin, unnerving her slightly. The 
dark-haired woman raised her eyes from the newspaper.

Serena&#39;s eyes were twinkling with... something. Rei fidgeted in her 
seat, becoming increasingly uncomfortable.

Without warning, a pair of slender arms wrapped around her neck. Rei 
suddenly felt a small frame pressing against her own, warming her body. 
The faint scent of sakura blossoms and chocolate reached her nose, 
calming her speeding heart.

&quot;Oh, Rei! Thank you! I know you don&#39;t have to do any of this, thank you 
so much!&quot;

Serena knew she was on the brink of tears, but she didn&#39;t care. She also 
knew any minute now, Rei would push her away, pull out a gun and tell 
her that if she ever touched her again, she&#39;d kill her. But the assassin 
didn&#39;t, surprisingly. Instead, she wrapped her strong arms, however 
hesitantly, around the girl in her lap.

Rei&#39;s mind reeled to comprehend why it felt so good to hold the blonde. 
She was excited, but also felt peaceful at the same time. Serena&#39;s body 
was so fragile now that she held her in her arms, so innocent as she 
felt tears dampening her shirt. She tried not to pull away, knowing that 
would hurt the shorter girl. And she didn&#39;t even yell at herself for the 
thought.

What she did think about, however, was how much the blonde was affecting 
her. She, surprisingly, found Serena&#39;s kindness and innocence 
attractive. Very attractive. As attractive as Minako&#39;s confidence and 
self-assured nature.

The train of thought stopped as Serena released her hold around the 
elegant neck. A light blush covered her cheeks, but it did nothing to 
hamper the smile on those pink lips. Actually, it made the blonde so 
much more... adorable. The assassin released her own hold on the petite 
body as her hostage slipped off her lap. It took a few seconds before 
Rei could compose herself completely, her voice sounding more like a 
croak than anything.

&quot;Finish breakfast. I&#39;ll be back.&quot;

Before Serena could even speak, the raven-haired beauty was out the 
door. The blonde only blinked.

~*~*~*~

Serena was lying on her stomach, humming a cheerful tune as she flipped 
through the pages of the catalogue. Without take her eyes off of the 
page, she reached over to her left, picked up a piece of popcorn shrimp 
and popped it into her mouth.

Rei sat at the dining table next to the living room and by the glass 
wall, shaking her head at the blonde before returning to her unfinished 
newspaper. The normality of the situation was... absurd.

&quot;Hey, Rei, ya think I&#39;ll need shorts?&quot;

The question earned the blonde the rolling of the assassin&#39;s eyes. She 
didn&#39;t even look in Serena&#39;s direction as she took another bite of her 
fish.

&quot;It&#39;s almost winter, Serena. Use common sense.&quot;

The glare the blonde threw at Rei was completely useless, seeing as how 
she was blushing like crazy. An amused smirk touched the taller woman&#39;s 
lips. Oh yeah, she still had some form of control.

&quot;Okay, that&#39;s it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve decided?&quot;

&quot;Of course not! I just flipped through the whole thing! Now I have to go 
back and choose.&quot;

Serena smiled when she heard Rei groan. It&#39;s been going on all day, this 
teasing back and forth. It made the blonde feel a lot more at ease. But 
the reminder that she&#39;s being held captive never left her.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back.&quot;

Blue eyes watched in confusion as Rei stood abruptly and hurried out of 
the room, her voice flat. What in the world?

&#39;Just don&#39;t ask,&#39; Serena told herself. &#39;Whatever it is, Rei will take 
care of it.&#39;

It was scary just how much the blonde trusted her abductor. Not that she 
had any choice in the matter. She was the prisoner and Rei was her 
jailer. Even if she didn&#39;t want to just leave everything to the 
raven-haired beauty, she didn&#39;t exactly have a say in anything. But... 
it was confusing her! This unfounded and completely ridiculous trust! 
There must have been something in the shrimp.

&quot;Decide yet?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Was Serena&#39;s intelligent answer as Rei returned. &quot;What? No, not 
yet.&quot;

Rei sat down, watching the way Serena shook herself out of her thoughts 
and focusing once again on the catalogue. What was she thinking?

&#39;Who knows. Better question, why do you care?&#39;

The assassin sighed softly. This was just getting out of hand. And she&#39;s 
only been with the blonde for a week.

&quot;Rei, do you think I look better in white or black?&quot;

&quot;White,&quot; the assassin answered almost immediately. Serena gave her a 
strange look and nodded.

Lavender eyes closed as the taller woman tried her best not to beat 
herself over the head. What about maintaining her cool demeanor? It&#39;s 
just that she didn&#39;t want to see someone as innocent as Serena in black. 
It was just wrong. She&#39;s come to associate the color with her job, her 
life.

That aside, why didn&#39;t Serena ask for her opinion?

&#39;Idiot, who else would she ask? The popcorn shrimp? Get it together, 
Hino.&#39;

&quot;Be sure to get a few sweatshirts, it does get quite cold this high up.&quot;

Serena just gave a soft &quot;hmmm&quot; and continued with her selection. Rei 
looked at her abandoned (not for the first time) paper. She found 
herself hoping the blonde didn&#39;t order too much. Sure, she said she 
could get whatever she wanted and she was in no way poor, but after 
going shopping with Minako, she was weary of any shopping with blondes.

&quot;Jeans or cargo pants?&quot;

&quot;You look good in both.&quot;

The short, nonchalant response caused Serena to blush, though Rei hadn&#39;t 
meant it to be a compliment. At least, she didn&#39;t think so...

Serena suddenly remembered the night she first met Rei. Part of the 
reason she was drawn to the woman was because she was the only waitress 
in the club that wore baggy cargoes and not a tight miniskirt. With that 
in mind, she checked the box.

The assassin stood, her own plates in hand, and walked over to the 
blonde on the floor. She picked up her captive&#39;s plate but left the bowl 
of popcorn shrimp, noting the cute expression of the girl as she tried 
to choose between two shirts. How anyone would look that thoughtful 
while picking clothes was beyond her. Not to say that she didn&#39;t have a 
passionate love for fashion as well...

Rei dumped the empty plates into the already full sink and turned to 
leave. But something made her stop, something made her sigh and that 
same thing made her walk back to the sing. That something then forced 
her to turn on the water, pick up the sponge and squirt some dishwashing 
liquid on it.

It wasn&#39;t that she was a messy person. Far from it. Well, maybe not that 
far. It was just that something about doing the dishes made her... Let&#39;s 
just say she just generally stayed far away from the dirty dishes. 
Usually, she&#39;d wait until they were piled so high they&#39;d fall or one of 
her friends made her do it at gunpoint, literally. Whichever came first. 
And by that time, it would start to smell pretty funky in the kitchen. 
Besides, she didn&#39;t eat home that often. Hell, she wasn&#39;t even home most 
of the time. So, dishes can go weeks without being washed.

But why was she doing it now? Perhaps because someone else was in the 
house with her?

Well, just because Serena knew she was an assassin didn&#39;t mean she had 
to know she was a slob.

~*~*~

Rei walked back into the living room, sighing. Dishes. Blah.

&quot;Rei? I&#39;m finished.&quot;

The assassin sat down on the couch, stepping over the girl lying on the 
floor.

&quot;Already?&quot;

&quot;Already? You&#39;ve been gone for over half an hour!&quot;

The cool demeanor fell slightly as Rei arched a brow.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m serious! Check the time.&quot;

Violet eyes turned to the clock, discovering that indeed half an hour 
had gone by. She could kill, kidnap, sabotage and destroy buildings in 
seconds but dishes take her that long?!

&quot;I think I want to go to bed. Can I take a shower?&quot;

&quot;By all means, go ahead.&quot;

Rei took the catalogue from the blonde.

&quot;Night.&quot;

As Serena disappeared into the bathroom, the assassin placed the order 
form on the coffee table, curious as to what the blonde wanted. Perhaps 
just a tiny peak...

~*~*~

Blue eyes opened groggily, snuggling deeper into the covers. Hmm... this 
felt so good. A look at the clock informed her that it was only nine.

&#39;I shouldn&#39;t even be awake for another couple of hours.&#39;

Just then, Serena remembered she was at Rei&#39;s house and quickly sat up.

&#39;That&#39;s it Usa, show her just how lazy you are!&#39;

She didn&#39;t bother changing before walking out of her room and heading 
for the kitchen. It was empty.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

There was no response as her call echoed through the large apartment. 
Wondering where the assassin went, she sat down on the plush couch. Rei 
probably went to run an errand or something. She wouldn&#39;t leave her 
alone unless she had to.

The blonde shivered as she wrapped her arms around herself. It was 
freezing! Serena looked around, hopping to see a note when her eyes fell 
on the phone.

If only she could...

No. No. Rei was nice to her. She wouldn&#39;t hurt her unless she had to. 
And Rei would be in danger as well...

&#39;What the hell are you thinking?! Have you completely lost your mind? 
This is your kidnapper we&#39;re talking about! This is THE Raven. Who the 
hell would be crazy enough to hurt her? You&#39;re the victim here.&#39;

Serena bit her lip as her hands fidgeted in her lap. She was the victim 
here. But she was being treated so nicely. And Rei, no matter who she 
is, shouldn&#39;t be in danger...

&#39;She COULD have been lying to you about her being in danger, genius. 
You&#39;re so damn gullible anyway...&#39;

Better question, why the FUCK was she talking to herself? That&#39;s it, 
being kidnapped has done something to her mind...

The blue-eyed aristocrat stood quickly and hurried to the fridge. She&#39;s 
cook breakfast. Yeah, that&#39;s it. Cooking should take her mind off of 
things.

~*~*~

Smoke filled the entire apartment like a thick cloud as a certain blonde 
ran out of the kitchen, the swing door creating enough wind for the 
smoke to be parted ever so slightly and for her watering blue eyes to 
see which way it was to the balcony.

Finding it, Serena took off faster than a track star, covering the long 
distance in a matter of seconds. Which took less time than actually 
figuring out how to open the door....

Anyhow, when the door slid open, the coughing girl made her way outside, 
gasping for clean air. After a few minutes and the ability to breathe 
came back to her, Serena turned to check if the smoke had cleared. 
Fortunately, most it had... though she kept the door open just in case 
there was another... accident.

The tired blonde walked back inside and collapsed on the couch. Who knew 
pancake batter was flammable and coffee machines exploded? It&#39;s going to 
be more trouble cleaning up than making breakfast! Not that she actually 
made breakfast. It was the thought that counted.

Blue eyes were drawn to the phone by the couch once again. It was like 
this magnetic and irresistible pull...

She would make one phone call. Just one. And it was to tell Minako she 
was okay. To ease her poor cousin&#39;s mind...

And maybe she&#39;d drop a hint or six that she was in Tokyo. And that she 
was in the rich sector of the city. And what a magnificent view she 
could see from up here, like her old school, the bank next to the little 
park...

Blue eyes stared at the little plastic object sitting on top of the 
pretty end table. It would be so simple just to pick up the damn phone 
and call. She didn&#39;t have any attachments to Rei. Hell, the bitch 
kidnapped her. She should be more than ready to pick up the phone and 
call Minako. What the hell is she saying, she should be calling the 
police.

Fuck it. Why wasn&#39;t she more like her father? He&#39;d call the police, 
hell, he&#39;d call the national guard the second he discovered Rei wasn&#39;t 
home.

But she wasn&#39;t like her father. And in this case, was it good or bad?

But, what about Minako? How was she taking everything? The woman that 
she was interested in was an assassin that used her to kidnap her 
cousin. It has to hurt. And she must be blaming herself. It wasn&#39;t her 
fault though, Rei was Raven, it&#39;s understandable that she was fooled. 
But Serena knows things like that does nothing to ease the guilt and 
anger.

So she picked up the phone and before the receiver was even at her ear, 
she began to dial.

And the front door opened.

Panic seized the blonde as she felt her blood run cold. What if Rei saw 
her with the phone? Would she kill her?

The blonde quickly placed the receiver down onto the as softly as she 
could before standing. The taller woman entered, looking surprised to 
see her.

&quot;You&#39;re up already?&quot;

The kidnapped girl tried her best not to fidget, though she couldn&#39;t 
look at Rei. As her blue eyes darted nervously around her room, she 
managed to keep her voice from wavering. This was why she never went 
into acting like Mamo-kun...

&quot;Where were you?&quot;

Serena looked at the assassin just in time to see her confident stance 
falter as the palest of blushes crept up on her cheeks. Nervousness was 
forgotten as curiosity took over.

&quot;I... eh... got you these.&quot;

The assassin held up several shopping bags as she approached the blonde. 
The shorter girl&#39;s eyes widened as they were placed before her on the 
coffee table.

&quot;Well, the weather&#39;s much colder than it&#39;s supposed to be. You&#39;d freeze, 
not to mention stink, with just two shirts and a skirt to wear by the 
time the clothes you ordered would come. So, I went downtown and picked 
it up at the store. Fortunately, they had everything you wanted.&quot;

Serena was silent, staring at the bags. Rei shifted, unsure of what was 
going on in that blonde head.

Without speaking, the older girl threw herself at her captor, arms 
wrapped tightly around her neck. Rei struggled to overcome her shock and 
keep them both upright. This was the second time in 24 hours. And it 
wasn&#39;t like they were about to have sex or anything, like with other 
people she&#39;s hugged. It&#39;s just a appreciative hug.

Were hugs, even just appreciative ones, supposed to feel this good?

Serena pulled away slightly, staring at her abductor with those big baby 
blues. The lavender eyes were surprisingly gentle, a small smile on her 
ruby lips and the lightest of blushes still tainting the porcelain 
cheeks.

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re-&quot;

Rei stopped when the blonde placed a light peck on her cheek. Serena, 
blushing at her rather bold move, took the bags and ran off. She didn&#39;t 
even expect herself to do that!

With a smile on her face, Rei sat down on the couch. That was pretty 
much the first time she ever seen anyone get that happy over something 
as trivial as what she did. God knows she didn&#39;t understand that girl.

Her eyes darkened as she reached over and picked up the phone Serena 
held tightly just minutes ago. Her face was blank as she felt the warmth 
from Serena&#39;s hand slowly leave the plastic surface.

She should kill her, or at least teach her who was in control here. 
True, she had very little control over herself right now, but she was 
still the assassin, the abductor. Any other person would be half-dead if 
they tried what the blonde did.

But it was Serena. And for some weird, unknown and infuriating reason, 
that made all the damn difference in the world. And only God knows why 
exactly that is. It was pointless to beat herself up over it.

Violet turned into lavender as her eyes turned to the door behind which 
the blonde disappeared seconds ago, the sounds of gleeful screams 
reaching her sensitive ears. She was so easily pleased...

The eyes somehow retained their light color as they settled on the 
unplugged phone line just a few feet from where the phone was. Did the 
blonde honestly think she&#39;d keep the phone plugged? No, she probably 
didn&#39;t even think about that...

This whole situation was too weird for Rei, too abnormal. From them 
being at her house to her own reactions to Serena herself. Either way, 
she wouldn&#39;t have to put up with it for that long. And as long as she 
remembers who she is, she&#39;ll be fine.

The assassin was snapped out of her reverie as the bedroom door swung 
open and out rushed an excited Serena. She twirled around once in a pair 
of black jeans she didn&#39;t order and a pink shirt she didn&#39;t pick.

&quot;Rei! Thanks so much! I didn&#39;t even ask for these! You&#39;re so nice! And 
you have such good tastes!&quot;

The taller woman shook her head at the innocent excitement of her 
hostage. Whatever she was thinking of before disappeared as she returned 
Serena&#39;s grin with a far more subdued smile.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hola! How&#39;s everyone doing? I haven&#39;t updated this in a while, I know. 
I&#39;ve been lazy. Very much so. If you don&#39;t believe that, blame it on my 
inability to read my own handwriting. It&#39;s pretty bad.

Anyhow, thanks lots to her Ebilness, who was kind enough to read the 
rough draft of my abominable chapter. My grammar sucks... really sucks. 
And to Meg, who is always willing to read the chapter before anyone else 
and tell me if it&#39;s good or if my ass needs to start working harder. 
What would I do without you two? Actually have to read my own shit? Lol.

Hmm... Gravity of Love is a bit harder to write for me than Fallen From 
Grace, as I&#39;m sure some of you have noticed by the frequency with which 
I update each fic. But since I&#39;ve been listening to &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; by 
Enigma a lot, a song which I LOVE from the bottom of my heart, the 
inspiration is coming back. And since Fallen is ending very, very soon, 
Gravity of Love should be updated a lot faster. So, please be patient!</pre>
