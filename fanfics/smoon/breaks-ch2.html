<h1>Break the Silence (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/breaks-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Let&#39;s go on holidays!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Haruka who said on the couch and listened to the news on TV
rose her head and looked at Michiru in surprise. The senshi of the
wide ocean sat down next to her and put the opened atlas down at her
lap.

&quot;We&#39;ve never been on holidays and at the moment there&#39;s such a nice
weather. It&#39;s nice warm and dry.&quot; A confident smile appeared on
Michiru&#39;s face. &quot;And at the moment it doesn&#39;t look like our enemies
will find a new victim. Why don&#39;t we just use this short time of
peace?&quot;

The young car racer switched off the TV and put the remote control on
the table. Then she stared at the atlas down on her knees. A part of
Japan was surrounded by a big red line.

&quot;Holidays in the mountains?&quot; she asked quietly as she read the names
of the nearer cities within the red line.

&quot;Why not? We can use our bikes and spend the nights in a tend. One or
two weeks will do wonder.&quot; The blue eyes of the young violinist shone
enthusiastically.

Haruka watched her in silence. It was about a week that the last youma
tried to get the heart crystal of the old man at his party. They
didn&#39;t talk about it afterwards. They just kept on with their lives.
Haruka hat some training with her race car and Michiru took part at
several small concert in Tokyo. Everything was how it had been before
the incident at the party. But somehow it was different.

&quot;You aren&#39;t kidding, are you?&quot; asked the young car racer but she also
liked the idea to get out of this city and get into nature. To leave
all those problems behind. To forget their mission. Just for some
days. But these days would be enough to regain new strength. New hope.

&quot;No...&quot; Doubt covered the enthusiasm in Michiru&#39;s face. She didn&#39;t
even think about any refusal of the taller senshi. She just thought
that Haruka would like her idea as much as she did.

Maybe it was a silly idea.

&quot;But if you don&#39;t want to go on holidays... Well, I can understand
that your training is more important... and the youmas... and the
talismans...&quot;

Nothing is more important to me than you.

&quot;No, Michi-chan. I like this idea. When do we start?&quot; Haruka smiled
confident and was happy as the sad expression disappeared from the
face of the smaller woman.

&quot;Arigato, Ruka!&quot; Before the young car racer could react Michiru had
already wrapped her arms around her waist and squeezed her gently.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t strangle me!&quot; gasped Haruka and blushed against her will.

&quot;You would have deserved it!&quot; mocked Michiru and looked up into two
green eyes. She laid half over the young car racer on the soft couch.

It&#39;s a good feeling to have her by my side.

The young violinist rose her hand and touched thoughtlessly Haruka&#39;s
short blonde hair and stroke it gentle.

It&#39;s alike if she&#39;s male or female.

The senshi of the wind just stared at her and automatically wrapped
her arms around her slim body. Then she winced.

Michiru pulled herself back at that very moment and blushed slightly.
&quot;Everything okay, Ruka? What about your back?&quot; The whole last week she
didn&#39;t ask again about the wounds. Not that she didn&#39;t remember them.
She just didn&#39;t dare to break the silence that seemed to surrounded
Haruka. And her, too.

&quot;I am alright, Michi-chan. Don&#39;t worry. I am strong enough to carry
rucksack. With lemonade, chocolate, crisps and waffles.&quot;

&quot;Baahh...&quot; Michiru made a face and Haruka had to grin.

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s my way to make proper holidays.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve survived worse. But I will take a torch, a pocket knife, a
sleeping bag and some medicine with me.&quot; Declared the young violinist
and went over to the kitchen and opened the fridge. &quot;And some rolls.&quot;
She said after she observed the contents of it.

&quot;So I&#39;ll have the funny things and you the serious ones.&quot; Haruka sat
down on the round table in the middle of the kitchen and ran a steady
hand through her short blonde hair. &quot;I hope they aren&#39;t too heavy for
you.&quot;

&quot;Hey, you actually forgot how heavy lemonade and chocolate can be.&quot;
Mocked Michiru and spun around. A happy smile laid on her face Haruka
loved so much.

You smile too less, Michi-chan.

&quot;And you forgot how strong I am!&quot; Haruka made a sulky face which
always made Michiru laugh. So it did this time.

&quot;My strong super hero.&quot; She joked and laughed a little bit more.

Haruka watched her with a honest smile on her face. The sun shone
through the open kitchen window and wind played with the sea green
hairs.

She looks like an angel.

&quot;I thought that we could leave tomorrow early in the morning.&quot;

&quot;Early in the morning?&quot; Haruka mad a desperate face and tried to yawn.

&quot;You&#39;ll survive it. I am sure.&quot; Michiru opened the fridge again and
took out some bowls. &quot;I&#39;ll make the food and you repair my bike.
That&#39;s a deal, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;What, you didn&#39;t repair your wheel? You had this accident five months
ago!&quot; Haruka jumped off the table and observed the contents of the
bowls.

&quot;Well, I have you to repair my bike, haven&#39;t I? O, Ruka! Don&#39;t pinch a
bit! Otherwise you&#39;d have to starve the next days.&quot;

&quot;Not with you by my side.&quot; Haruka blushed again as Michiru rose her
head at her ill-considered declaration. She took a deep breathe and
turned toward the door. &quot;I&#39;ll repair your wheel.&quot; She said and left
the kitchen.

Michiru watched her for some seconds than she took a knife and started
to make their food for the next days.

&quot;Hai...&quot; she whispered but a confident smile laid on her now redden
face.

Step by step.

***

&quot;Good morning, Ruka!&quot;

Haruka turned away from the exiting voice and pulled her blanket over
her head.

&quot;It&#39;s too early.&quot; She mumbled tired and shut her eyes as someone
opened her curtains and let the bright sunlight into the twilight of
the room.

&quot;Get up! We&#39;re going on holidays!&quot; declared Michiru aloud and jumped
into the bed. She grabbed the blanket and pulled it away
energetically.

&quot;Michiru!&quot; At the next moment Haruka sat upright and fetched the cloth
back. She covered her nakedness. The last day had been very hot and
after she finished her shower she just went into bed without pulling
over her white shirt. So she didn&#39;t sweat so much.

When I had known that Michiru would wake me up I would have never...

&quot;So you&#39;re awake at last. Get up, my little late riser. Breakfast&#39;s
ready and I don&#39;t want to leave after seven o&#39;clock.&quot;

She&#39;s so beautiful...

&quot;Seven o&#39;clock?&quot; whispered Haruka and yawned. &quot;How late is it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s already six.&quot; Declared Michiru and smiled as she saw the shocked
expression in Haruka&#39;s face. She ran friendly a steady hand through
the wild blonde hairs and went back to the door.

&quot;Six o&#39;clock?&quot; asked the young car racer and yawned again.

&quot;Hai.&quot; Michiru left the room of her best friend and went over to the
kitchen.

&quot;You&#39;re nuts!&quot; yelled Haruka after her and laid back down on her bed.
She yawned again but she smiled as she pulled away the blanket to
dress up.

***

The world rushed by fast. Tokyo, other cities, suburban areas,
meadows, rice fields, trees, rivers and some small lakes passed by
with a high speed. Just the sun seemed to stay in the endless
cloudless sky.

Michiru sat silently near the window and watched her home Country.
They took the train in Tokyo to get to the mountains. The big city was
about two hundred miles far away from the place they wanted to spend
their holidays. They decided to take this fast means of transport,
because the route towards the mountains leaded through different big
cities and Michiru wanted to see nature not glass, concrete and
honking cars.

The train drove through a long black tunnel. Michiru squinted as they
returned to the surface and the bright light of the powerful sun
dazzled.

The young violinist felt the head that leaned against her shoulder and
looked down at the sleeping Haruka by her side. A smile appeared on
Michiru&#39;s face as she watched her car racer sleeping.

It&#39;s been too early for her.

Thoughtful she rose her left hand and stroke gently through the short
blonde hair. It felt like velvet. Michiru loved this feeling. Haruka
opened her eyes a little chasm for some seconds. Dreamy she looked in
the young violinist&#39;s face and smiled tired. Her warm hand took the
stroking of Michiru and hold it tight.

&quot;Just two minutes more.&quot; Whispered Haruka then she settled back into
sleep.

She&#39;s so cute.

Michiru squeezed gently the hand then she returned towards the window
and watched the world out there. She was happy. It was the first time
since she had been ten years old that she went on holidays. On real
holidays not on tour. For the first time she wasn&#39;t alone. She went on
holidays together with her Ruka!

The door to their compartment opened and a woman about the forties
entered.

&quot;May I sit down?&quot;

Michiru observed her for some seconds.

Maybe she is indeed forty, she dresses and makes up like a twenty old
teenager.

&quot;Hai.&quot;

The woman sat down and corrected the order of her black skirt and her
white blouse.

Surely a business woman.

Michiru watched the world for a while while the woman studied a big
newspaper.

&quot;Are you going on holidays?&quot; asked the woman finally after she had
observed quietly the two rucksack and the couple in front of her.

&quot;Hai. Went want to spend some days up in the mountains.&quot; Replied
Michiru politely but didn&#39;t turn her head.

&quot;How romantic! When I was young my husband and I used to do such crazy
holidays too. Now he&#39;s too ill for such adventures. Now we make our
holidays in Europe.&quot;

&quot;Interesting.&quot; But honestly Michiru just wanted the woman to shut up.
She had an idea for a new song and needed her peace to make up her
mind for the new melody inside her head.

For a while they just sat there in silence.

&quot;Where are you from?&quot;

&quot;Tokyo.&quot; Michiru tried not to roll her eyes. It was very hard not to
show her boredom.

&quot;A nice city. And far away.&quot; The young violinist could feel how the
woman looked from Haruka&#39;s sleeping face into her. &quot;Your boyfriend
seems to be very tired.&quot;

&quot;Haruka&#39;s a late riser.&quot;

&quot;But today he didn&#39;t sleep until midday. That&#39;s romantic.&quot; Dreamed the
young woman and looked up to the ceiling. &quot;Young love is always so
romantic. When I was your age I believed that I could change the
world. That I could move mountains together with my boyfriend. Now
he&#39;s my husband and we didn&#39;t move anything. But we&#39;re happy together
and that&#39;s all what&#39;s count, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Michiru looked down at Haruka and a her eyes shone sadly.

It must be fantastic to grow old with the one you love.

&quot;Hai...&quot; she whispered.

Where will be my Ruka when I am forty?

Michiru leaned her head against Haruka&#39;s and closed her eyes.

Will I ever become so old or will I die because of a youma?

The woman seemed to say anything more but she was interrupted by the
announcement of the locomotive personal.

Michiru opened her eyes and ignored her sad thoughts. Now they went on
holidays and for these few days there won&#39;t be any youmas. No
talismans and no missions would disturb their peace.

&quot;Ruka.&quot; Whispered the young violinist and squeezed gently her warm
hand.

She feels so good!

&quot;What...&quot; mumbled the young car racer and Michiru saw that Haruka
didn&#39;t want to open her eyes and end her sleep.

&quot;Get up, Ruka. The train arrives our goal in about five minutes and we
have to fetch our bikes.&quot;

&quot;Then fetch them and give me these five minutes more...&quot; Haruka&#39;s
voice was still full of sleep and slightly she yawned.

&quot;Sometimes you&#39;re terrible.&quot; Whispered Michiru but she smiled as she
leaned forward and gave her young car racer a light kiss an her
cheeks. Haruka&#39;s eyes flew open and she stared at her young violinist
in confusion. Then she blushed slightly.

&quot;Awake at last?&quot; joked the young woman and stood up.

I hope she didn&#39;t hear my heart beat.

Michiru went over to the rucksacks and took it into her trembling
hands.

&quot;C&#39;mon, Ruka. I don&#39;t want to miss the station!&quot;

&quot;Hai...&quot; whispered Haruka and stretched herself to dispel her
tiredness and calm down her suddenly exited body. For some seconds you
could see the young car racer&#39;s female outlines though the wide yellow
shirt she wore over her short blue jeans. Michiru saw the confused
look of the business woman that changed fast into something worse.

First she looked at Haruka and then at Michiru.

&gt;Don&#39;t look at me this way!&lt;

The young violinist heard again the calm voice of her car racer in her
head.

Michiru took the second rucksack in her left hand and seized with her
right on Haruka&#39;s. Then she left the compartment without any words.
Suddenly she could understand Haruka&#39;s strange behaviour. But she
would never accept it.

&quot;Everything fine?&quot; asked Haruka as she took her bike. She had seen the
sad expression on the face of the smaller senshi and wondered why
Michiru should be sad. They went on holidays. That was no reason to
moan.

&quot;Hai.&quot; The young violinist turned her head and smiled happily.
When the train arrived the station they left.

Michiru didn&#39;t look back to see the woman who watched them both in
silence. With an estimate look in her dark eyes.

***

The bright sun shone from the endless sky above. A small river flew
near the sandy way they drove along. Huge trees covered the way with
shadows and cows stood on green meadows and ate their grass.

Michiru rose her head and looked up to the mountains that came nearer
and nearer. Soon they would surrounded them.

Maybe we can climb on such a high peak. It must be a great feeling to
be on top of the world...

She sighed happily and closed her eyes for some seconds to enjoy the
wind that played with her long sea green hair.

Haruka turned her head and smiled slightly as she saw the luck in the
smaller senshi&#39;s face.

She looks so beautiful. Like an angel...

Haruka sighed and concentrated on the way under the wheels of her
mountain bike. She wanted to tell Michiru about her feelings. But she
didn&#39;t dare to. What if she wouldn&#39;t understand her? If she would
laugh at her.

What if I loses my one and only friend?

The reached a fork and Haruka took the right way without looking on
the map she carried in her rucksack.

&quot;Why did you chose for this direction?&quot; asked Michiru as she reached
her after some seconds. Haruka war very fast. Sometimes too fast for
the young violinist. But she waited when she recognized it.

&quot;Because it leads to a mountain lake, my little mermaid.&quot;

&quot;Great. I am already sweaty.&quot; They arrived the station four hours ago
and since these four hours they drove towards the mountains. Michiru
would have never admitted it but she was indeed a little bit tired.

Well, I am not as well trained as Ruka.

&quot;A bath will be fantastic.&quot;

&quot;The water&#39;s surely very cold.&quot; Wondered Haruka because she knew her
Michiru. The young violinist always froze. Even in the hottest summer.
But if she was in her wet element it was always perfect. Michiru never
complaint about the temperature of the water.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to join me.&quot; Laughed Michiru and screamed quietly as
her bike jumped over a stone she didn&#39;t see. But she could react and
didn&#39;t fall off the bike.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Haruka stopped her bike next to her and looked
concerned at the smaller senshi.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Michiru laughed and speeded up. &quot;The last one is a lazy
chicken!&quot; she declared while she reached the next bound.

&quot;Cheater!&quot; Haruka followed her. She had to laugh too.

An hour later they arrived the small lake. It was surrounded by old
trees and if you looked up to the sky you could see the top of a huge
mountain that seemed to be near. But you would have to walk for some
more hours to reach it.

&quot;How peaceful.&quot; Declared Michiru as she laid down her bike and stepped
towards the lake until she stood with her feet in the cool water.

&quot;Nothing can be heard. No noises of the big city, no arguments of
angry people. No screams of victims. No mad laughter of some youmas.&quot;
Michiru opened her arms wide and closed her eyes. She felt the water
on her skin and heard the rushes of the leaves.

Haruka who covered a shadow place near the lake with a blanket looked
up and watched her young violinist silently.

&quot;Michi-chan...&quot;

The desire to go to her and hold her in her arms was almost
irresistible. Haruka clenched her fists and stepped automatically
back.

Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a good idea to go on holidays with her...

&quot;Hai?&quot; Michiru spun around and ran to her. Haruka smiled and the
tomboy expression returned on her face.

&quot;I am hungry.&quot; Declared the young car racer and sat down on the
blanket.

&quot;Well, maybe I can help you.&quot; Michiru kneeled down next to her and
observed the contents of her rucksack. &quot;Here are some sandwiches with
salad and a sausage and an apple. You&#39;ve got the lemonade.&quot; She said
finally. Her blue eyes shone lucky as she gave the food into Haruka&#39;s
suddenly ice cold hands.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you hungry?&quot; asked the young car racer while she unwrapped the
sandwiches.

&quot;Hai, but first I wanna swim.&quot; Michiru pulled her t-shirt she wore
over her head and threw it on the blanket. Haruka coughed because and
her sandwich seemed to be very dry with a sudden. Then she realized
that the young violinist wore a swimsuit under the short blue skirt.

With a splash she ran into the cool wet. The water spray through the
air and shimmered in the bright sunlight. Michiru stood in the middle
of the fountain and laughed happily as Haruka put up her arms
protectively as Michiru tried to splash her.

The young car racer put down her sun glasses and watched her silently
for a while.

I love you so much!

The water calmed down and Michiru started to swim silently through the
small lake. Haruka sighed and laid back on the carpet after she had
eaten up her sandwich. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the peace that
suddenly surrounded them. Rare peace.

She laid there for a long while. Then she felt suddenly some cold wet
trop upon her yellow shirt and made a face. As she opened her eyes she
could see the laughing face of the smaller senshi that was surrounded
by sea green wet hairs. By so cold hairs.

&quot;Iiih!&quot; Haruka sat upright in the next moment. &quot;The water&#39;s really
cold!&quot; she declared loudly.

&quot;But refreshing. C&#39;mon, Ruka. Just five minutes. They&#39;ll do wonder,
believe me.&quot; Michiru came nearer and Haruka watched her with horror in
her deep green eyes.

&quot;No! That&#39;s certainly too cold!&quot; The young car racer screamed as
Michiru touched her right leg with her icy hands. &quot;You&#39;re impossible!&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; A wicked grin appeared on Michiru&#39;s face as she grabbed
Haruka&#39;s arm and tried to guide her towards the lake.

&quot;No!&quot; said Haruka again and wanted to go back to the blanket.

&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t wanna a skunk in my tend.&quot; Declared Michiru and already
stood with one food in the cool water.

&quot;Just one tend?&quot; asked Haruka surprised and the young violinist used
the moment of hesitation and pulled the young car racer with her into
the lake.

&quot;Michiru!&quot; gasped Haruka as she returned to the surface. &quot;Do you wanna
kill me?!&quot; She tried to get out of the water but Michiru was faster.
Haruka could be as fast as the wind in her car, on her motorbike or in
her race, but in the water the senshi of the ocean was unbeaten.
Quickly she wrapped her arms around Haruka&#39;s waist from behind and 
hold her back.

&quot;Leaving so soon?&quot; she mocked and giggled as Haruka turned around and
tried to pull her head under the surface. But Michiru was again too
fast. She evaded and instead of the young violinist the young car
racer dove into the cool water. Gasping for breathe Haruka came back
towards the surface. Michiru used the moments when the young car racer
searched for her and tickled her from behind. Haruka burst out into
laughter and tried to defend herself but Michiru was stronger in her

element.

&quot;Are you ticklish, my sweet Ruka?&quot; asked Michiru joking and didn&#39;t
stop.

&quot;Michi, please...&quot; laughed Haruka helplessly.

With a sudden Michiru stopped her punishment and wrapped her arms
again around Haruka&#39;s waist and held her tight. She leaned her head
against her shoulder and closed her eyes.

&quot;I like it when you laugh.&quot; Declared the senshi of the wide ocean
quietly. &quot;You laugh too less.&quot; For a while she just held her tight.

Haruka sighed slightly but she didn&#39;t dare to break the silence.

Motionless they stood there in the cool water.

&quot;Are you cold?&quot; asked Michiru after a while when she recognized the
shaking that went through Haruka&#39;s body.

&quot;No, this water&#39;s just too hot!&quot; answered Haruka ironically and turned
towards the smaller senshi. Automatically Michiru rose her arms and
took Haruka face in her hands. The blonde hairs were wet and the young
car racer looked wilder than normal. The yellow shirt was wet all over
and Michiru could see Haruka&#39;s breasts. Deeply the young violinist
looked up into dreamy green eyes.

She&#39;s a real woman.

Michiru smiled and begun to stroke the pale cheeks of the taller car
racer.

But it&#39;s okay for me...

Then she saw the blue lips and the shaking that continued through the
body of her friend.

&quot;Let&#39;s get out before you freeze to death.&quot; Declared Michiru and swam
towards the rim of the small lake.

&quot;How canny!&quot; mocked Haruka and followed her.

Hell, I am cold!

Haruka climbed out of the water and went over to the blanket.

And at the same time I am so hot!

&quot;Here...&quot; Michiru gave her a big towel and watched her with her
shinning blue eyes. &quot;Are you angry about me?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Haruka had to laugh at Michiru&#39;s pleading expression. Then she
started to dry her hair. &quot;But sometimes you&#39;re so overwhelming.&quot;

&quot;I hope so.&quot; Michiru laid into the bright sun to dry her swimsuit and
bit into a green apple she liked so much. &quot;Shall we stay here for the
night?&quot; she asked and looked up to the sky. They spend the whole
afternoon at the lake and now the sun slowly set.

&quot;Why not? It&#39;s a nice place.&quot; Haruka swallowed as she thought that
they just had one tent.

Why did she just brought one tent?

The young car racer searched her rucksack for some warm clothes and
considered how to change without Michiru seeing it. Without herself
blushing.

Well, we&#39;re both woman. It&#39;s okay for her to share it. It would be
another thing if I was really a man.

Haruka looked over to Michiru and sighed slightly. She still
remembered the feeling of two arms being wrapped around her waist. The
feeling of a small body pressed against her own

It&#39;s nothing special to her. Is it?

&quot;You set up the tent.&quot; Said Michiru tired and squinted in the bright
sun which lost it&#39;s power with every minutes. In about an hour it
would be dark night, because dawn was faster up in the mountains than
at the sea.

&quot;And what about you?&quot; Haruka changed quickly her yellow shirt into a
black one. Michiru turned her head and watched her in silence. A smile
laid on her face.

&quot;I will start praying that it won&#39;t break down in the middle of the
night.&quot; Michiru screamed as Haruka suddenly stood over her and tickled
her.

&quot;Gomen...&quot; she laughed happily and opened her arms with an
acquiescently gesture. &quot;I know I have deserved...&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice
died away as she saw the strange expression in Haruka&#39;s face. The
young car racer stopped tickling her and her warm hands rested
motionless on her hips.

I like this feeling. Being by her side.

Deep green eyes shone seriously as Haruka leaned forward. Michiru
watched her silently and her smile faded slightly. She wanted to say
something. Anything. But her voice didn&#39;t belong to her anymore. So
she just looked into these eyes she loved so much and hoped.

What am I doing?

Haruka stopped two inches away from Michiru&#39;s face. She could feel her
warm breathe upon her skin.

&quot;Better I&#39;ll set up the tent.&quot; The young car racer turned away and
stood up in a sudden. Then she took her rucksack and pulled out the
green cloth.

Michiru closed her eyes and wondered why tears burned behind her
lashes.

Why am I disappointed?

Silence fell upon the lake. None of them dared to break it.

***

It was dark night. Stars shone above in an endless sky. The sun was
gone and with her the hot of the summer. Haruka sat near the campfire.
A long black pullover warmed her. Quietly she looked into the flames
and wondered why she felt so sad. She was on holidays. With Michiru!

But instead of being happy she just felt empty. And alone.

The young violinist went into the tent some hours ago. But Haruka
couldn&#39;t sleep. She just sat there and watched the night in the
mountains. She listened to the rushes of the trees around and the
screams of the night animals that haunted now. She tried hard to
ignore the words of the rude man.

After another hour Haruka sighed slightly and gave up. It was about
one o&#39;clock in the night and she didn&#39;t want to fall asleep on her
bike the next morning.

Better I&#39;ll go to bed.

She erased the fire and moved quietly into the tent. Michiru laid in
her sleeping bag and slept deep and tight.

Sometimes I envy her...

Haruka climbed into her sleeping bag and turned towards the wall of
the tent. With an angry expression on her face she shut her eyes. But
she knew that it would take another long time until she would be able
to sleep. An restless sleep full of frightening nightmares.

Michiru opened her eyes and watched the back of the taller senshi for
some seconds. Then she stared again at the ceiling of the green tent.

I am so cold!

The sleeping bag could hardly warm her. But she didn&#39;t dare to ask
Haruka for...

What for? Holding me tight? Giving me some warmth? Excluding all my
fears?

Michiru closed her eyes but she couldn&#39;t fight back the tears that
were burning behind her lashes. Silently they fall down her pale
cheeks. She didn&#39;t make any sound. No sob escaped her shaking lips.
One thing she learned after the sudden death of her parents. She
couldn&#39;t fight back her tears, but when she was quietly no one
mentioned that she cried. No one could look at her with wrong pity.

It was already dawn when she finally settled into a light dreamless
sleep.

***

Michiru oppressed a yawn and stared tired in her soup plate. It was
her lunch and it was still hot. But she actually didn&#39;t have hunger.
Nor appetite.

The young violinist rose her head and looked around at the terrace of
a small restaurant. It looked like an old farmhouse in the middle of a
green valley. Maybe it used to be a farmhouse but now it was a hostel
for hungry tourists and hiker.

Michiru stared again in her soup and the nausea increased inside her
stomach. It was a hot summer day and she knew that she was the only
one who wore a thick pullover. The sun shone without mercy down at the
earth. But at the same time Michiru was very cold.

&quot;Hey, small one. Are you here all alone?&quot; asked a male voice and a
young man sat down on the chair next to her. Curious he looked at her
and Michiru sighed slightly. &quot;The mountains can be very dangerous for
such a beautiful woman like you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, super hero. I&#39;ve got my own protector.&quot; Replied the
young violinist and pointed over to Haruka who balanced her cola while
she tried to put the change back into the pockets of her short jeans.
When Michiru woke up in the morning Haruka had already left the tent
and made breakfast. They talked about different things and slowly they
got so familiar they had been the last day. They packed the tent and
carried on with their tour. Haruka was as funny as ever and Michiru
tried to be as happy as she had been yesterday. But at the same time
something changed.

We didn&#39;t talk about the last evening.

&quot;Oh... well...&quot; The young man seemed to be disappointed as he watched
the young car racer coming towards the table. &quot;Then I wish you a nice
day, young lady. Goodbye.&quot; He said quietly and went away.

&quot;Bye...&quot; whispered Michiru and stared back at her lunch.

Haruka observed the young man who talked to her young violinist.
Finally he stood up and came to her direction. He didn&#39;t stopped as
they passed by but the young woman believed to hear some sad words:
&quot;You lucky one.&quot;

Then the man was gone. Haruka turned her head but she couldn&#39;t see him
anymore. So she took place at her chair and ate her dinner. After a
while when her hunger was more bearable she recognized that Michiru
didn&#39;t eat anything.

&quot;Do you want to hypnotise your soup?&quot; she asked mocking and trunk half
of her cola.

&quot;It just doesn&#39;t taste.&quot; Declared Michiru but didn&#39;t look up.

&quot;Do you want anything else?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

Silence evolved between them. Haruka finished her meal and watched
quietly two small girls who played at the playground with a huge ball.

&quot;Who was the young man you were talking to?&quot; asked the young car racer
after a while and made a face as one of the girls stumbled and fell
hard on the grassy ground. Immediately it started to cry.

Michiru put the spun into the soup and shivered slightly as the wind
played with her long sea green hair.

Are you jealous, Ruka?

But she didn&#39;t dare to say it aloud.

&quot;Nothing important.&quot; She replied instead and stood up. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;
Haruka watched her young violinist walking over to the bikes and
taking her rucksack.

&quot;Hai...&quot; she whispered and followed her.

***

The whole day they drove through the mountains. They went up to
different viewpoints and climbed over some rocks to have a better look
over the valley. Michiru took several photos and after a while they
forgot that they had been angry about each other. It was such a
wonderful day and nature did it&#39;s best to make it fantastic.

Slowly the day ended and the sun started to set.

&quot;Hey, this is a nice place, isn&#39;t it?&quot; asked Michiru and shivered
again. She was still very cold and she could hardly drive her bike.
She reached the edge of her powers. But she didn&#39;t dare to talk to the
young car racer. She didn&#39;t want to look weak beside the strong senshi
of the wind.

&quot;Ruka?&quot; Michiru coughed and the world begun to spun around. Her head
ached more with every minute and her whole body started to tremble.
&quot;Just until the next valley. Please. It&#39;s still bright enough, don&#39;t
you think?&quot; could Michiru hear the exited voice of the taller senshi.
She rose her head and the dizziness increased. She could see Haruka
far away at the next bend.

&quot;Hai...&quot; she whispered. Then she lost the control over her bike. She
didn&#39;t see the rock that laid across the way. Her trembling hands
couldn&#39;t hold the handlebars any longer. Michiru wanted to scream but
she wasn&#39;t able to. She just fell down on the stony ground. Pain went
through her right leg and somewhere next to her she could hear how her
bike crashed down on the stone.

&quot;Shit...&quot; she coughed again and wanted to stand up. But her rucksack
was too heavy with a sudden. So she closed her burning eyes and waited
for some moments. Surely she would be able to stand up when the pain
disappeared a little bit. When the dizziness would have gone.

She could hear the noises of another bike and hoped that no one would
drive over her. It was already twilight and she didn&#39;t wore bright
clothes.

&quot;Michi-chan?&quot; A concerned voice next to hear let her open her eyes.
She looked into two green ones that were very concerned. &quot;What
happened?&quot; Haruka tried to help her up but she couldn&#39;t load her right
leg. The whole world spun around and the thought that her head was
going to explode.

&quot;Michi!&quot; yelled Haruka and held the young woman tight as she seemed to
faint.

&quot;Everything&#39;s fine. Just one moment rest...&quot; whispered the senshi of
the wide ocean and coughed again. She leaned her head against Haruka&#39;s
shoulder and closed again her burning eyes. &quot;I am just so tired...&quot;
admitted the smaller woman and shivered obviously.

Haruka helped her out of the rucksack and it landed somewhere on the
rocky ground. Carefully she took the face of the young violinist in
her hands and could feel the heat under the skin.

&quot;You&#39;ve got fever.&quot; She declared with a strange tone in her voice.
Cautiously she sat Michiru on the stone and stroke the sweaty hairs
out of the hot forehead. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me that you&#39;re feeling
ill?&quot; asked Haruka quietly and started to stroke the red cheeks of the
young violinist. Michiru opened her eyes as she felt that those strong
hands trembled.

&quot;I don&#39;t... don&#39;t want to be.. too... too weak...&quot; she stammered and
rose her head towards the suddenly pale face of Haruka. Green eyes
looked for some moments deep into two feverish shimmering ones.

&quot;You&#39;re never weak, Michi-chan. You&#39;re the strongest woman I know.&quot;
She declared calm. Then she went back to her bike and studied the map
in the twilight.

&quot;We passed a hotel some miles ago. I guess they&#39;ll have a doctor and a
warm bath for you.&quot; Haruka sighed slightly then she returned to the
sitting woman. &quot;Can you walk?&quot; she asked and looked doubtfully at the
bloody knee.

&quot;Hai...&quot; Michiru came hard on her feet and stumbled along the stony
way. &quot;Gomen...&quot;

Haruka took the two rucksacks and the two bikes. Quietly she went by
Michiru&#39;s side and scold herself how she could be so blind.

She didn&#39;t eat anything the whole day!

&quot;You don&#39;t have to apologise. Even strong women are weak time by
time.&quot; She said after a while they just walked slowly towards the
valley they left half an hour before.

Why didn&#39;t she just tell me? Don&#39;t she trust me anymore?

&quot;Believe me, I know what I am talking about.&quot;

Michiru looked up from the stony underground and nodded understanding.

***

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;The doctor told you that you need some rest. And I won&#39;t let you stay
the night in our tent where you would freeze. The ground is too hard
for you knee and I don&#39;t wanna be responsible for you getting a real
flu!&quot;

Michiru gave up. Haruka wanted to stay the night in the hotel and so
she couldn&#39;t say anything against it.

Ruka can be so stubborn!

She coughed and shivered again. The doctor bandaged her knee and it
would be okay the next day. If she took her medicine and slept well
they could carry on with their tour the next day. Or the day after
tomorrow. The young violinist stumbled slightly as she followed the
young car racer towards the reception.

&quot;Are any rooms free?&quot; asked Haruka a young woman who smiled friendly
at her. Michiru rolled her eyes and coughed again.

Please, don&#39;t flirt now!

Haruka returned the smile but as Michiru looked closer she could see
that the green eyes were empty. Somehow insensible...

&quot;Of course. We don&#39;t have holidays and it&#39;s in the middle of the week.
What do you want?&quot; The young woman looked in her computer and gave in
some dates.

&quot;A double room for one or two nights.&quot; Declared the young car racer
and swallowed.

&quot;Room number twenty. It&#39;s over there. Just use the lift.&quot; The young
woman gave the keys in Haruka&#39;s hands and the smile grew wider.

Ugly teeth!

Michiru coughed again and wondered why she didn&#39;t like the young
woman.

Maybe I am just too tired.

&quot;I hope you&#39;ll enjoy your stay in our hotel.&quot;

Haruka just nodded and turned towards Michiru. Now the green eyes
weren&#39;t empty. Suddenly they were full of concern and other feelings
the young violinist couldn&#39;t define.

&quot;Let&#39;s go and bring you to bed.&quot; Haruka took carefully Michiru&#39;s hand
and guided her towards the lift. Silently they reached the first
storey and entered their room. It was a great room with a huge bed in
the middle. A table and three chairs stood next to a big window. A
small door leaded towards a comfortable bathroom.

&quot;The last time I felt so ill was on the funeral of my parents.&quot;

Whispered Michiru and sat down on the soft mattress. She covered her
burning face with her icy hands.

&quot;Do you want to take a shower?&quot; asked Haruka while she observed the
small bathroom. &quot;Do you want anything else? Something to eat or...?&quot;

&quot;Just my medicine...&quot; mumbled Michiru but the idea of a nice warm
water pouring down her skin was tempting. &quot;Maybe a shower would be
fine.&quot; Slowly she stripped her pullover and stood up. Her legs
trembled and could hardly hold her weak body. Then she stripped her
shoes, her socks and her t-shirt. Then she entered the bathroom in
underwear. Haruka who already turned on the shower and controlled the
temperature blushed as she saw her.

&quot;Do you think you&#39;re able to take a shower?&quot; asked the senshi of the
wind concerned. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to slip on the wet ground.&quot;

&quot;You can join me if you like.&quot; Said Michiru in a quiet voice and
coughed again. Again the whole world seemed to spin around but she
ignored the feeling. She stripped her underwear and stepped under the
warm water. Michiru closed her eyes and enjoyed the feeling of being
in her element. The dizziness increased and she coughed again and
again until tears were running down her still wet cheeks. She searched
for hold at the wall but all she could find were cold flagstones. She
winced as the pain went through her right leg as her trembling body
gave up. Slowly she went on her knees and had to cough again. The
water fell down on her and suddenly she couldn&#39;t breathe anymore. The
water seemed to surround her and she feared to drown.

&quot;Michi-chan!&quot; She could hear the concern in Haruka&#39;s voice. The
waterfall of the shower stopped immediately. A soft towel was wrapped
around her trembling body and strong arms helped her up. Michiru rose
her head and looked into a pale face. Nothing remembered of the always
joking tomboy. Now Haruka&#39;s face was pale and her green eyes full of
concern and...

Love?

&quot;You&#39;re driving me crazy.&quot; She declared but her voice broke.

&quot;Not more than you are.&quot; Replied Michiru and coughed again. Haruka
looked at her for some seconds and seemed to say something. Then she
decided to be silent. Quietly she dried the smaller senshi and covered
her nakedness with another soft towel. Carefully she carried the young
violinist to the bed and sat her down on the soft mattress.

&quot;Did you bring any night dress with you or do you want a simple
t-shirt?&quot; asked Haruka while Michiru leaned against the wall and
closed her eyes. Her face was redden from the fever and her body still
trembled.

&quot;A dress. In my rucksack...&quot; whispered the young violinist and coughed
again. It sounded really ill.

I can&#39;t remember the last time I had been really ill.

Well, at least the doctor had declared that she just had a little cold
and not a dangerous flu. She didn&#39;t want to break up their holidays.
She didn&#39;t want their free days to end like this.

&quot;You call this a night dress?&quot; Haruka stared at disbelieve at the
light blue neglig&eacute;e.

&quot;How would you call it?&quot; asked Michiru and her voice was a little bit
angry as she grabbed the thin cloth and pulled it over her trembling
body.

Tempting...

Haruka swallowed hard and turned away to study the medicine the doctor
gave them.

&quot;Uncomfortable.&quot; She said instead aloud. Michiru just coughed again.
&quot;Well, you don&#39;t have to wear it, do you?&quot; she said and sighed loudly.
Then she took the medicine and crept under the soft blanket. Haruka
switched off the light and went over to the bathroom.

&quot;Sleep tight, Michi-chan.&quot; She whispered in the darkness and quietly
closed the door.

&quot;Sure...&quot; Michiru coughed again and looked at the ceiling of the hotel
room. Tears were burning in her feverish shinning eyes and her
headache seemed to explode her head. The world still spun around and
she felt so weak and helpless she had never felt before. So totally
alone.

The young violinist heard the noises of the shower. It seemed to last
an eternity until Haruka left the bathroom.

Were will she sleep?

Michiru didn&#39;t dare to hope that they would share this huge bed. The
young violinist closed her burning eyes and shivered again. Her legs
were ice cold and even the soft blanket couldn&#39;t warm her. She heard
how Haruka crossed the room and took something out or into her
rucksack.

Her sleeping bag?

&quot;Michi-chan?&quot; she heard suddenly the calm voice somewhere far away.

&quot;Hai?&quot; answered the young woman and coughed again. The roundabout she
seemed to sit in increased it&#39;s speed and she wondered why she didn&#39;t
fell out of it.

&quot;Are you cold?&quot;

&quot;Hai...&quot; Some tears fell down Michiru&#39;s cheek and she shivered again.
She felt how Haruka crept under the blanket and took her into her
strong arms. The body of the young car racer was so wonderful warm!
Michiru pulled herself a little bit closer and leaned her head against
Haruka&#39;s shoulder. She could feel the breasts under the shirt Haruka
misused as night dress. Slowly the young car racer put her legs
between Michiru&#39;s and warmed them.

She feels so soft.

&quot;Better now?&quot; asked Haruka with a strange tone in her voice Michiru
had never heard before. Carefully the senshi of the wind wiped away
the tears from the burning face of the smaller woman.

&quot;Hai.&quot; Answered Michiru and coughed again. The roundabout was still
turning around, but the cold left slowly her body.

&quot;Gomen, Michi-chan. I didn&#39;t mention that you were feeling ill.&quot;
Automatically Haruka begun to stroke the velvet sea green hairs.
Michiru looked up for some seconds. But she couldn&#39;t see Haruka&#39;s face
in the darkness. So she shut her eyes and enjoyed the feeling.
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me last night that you were freezing?&quot; asked the
young car racer. Her hand left the hairs and slipped under the thin
night dress. Tender she caressed the soft skin of Michiru&#39;s back.

&quot;One sleeping bag is too narrow for two, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Michiru yawned and
felt how the medicine did it&#39;s job. Slightly she settled into sleep.

&quot;Hai... but...&quot; Haruka sighed oppressed and leaned her head against
the one of the smaller senshi. For a long while she didn&#39;t say
anything. She just listened to the regular breathes of Michiru and
thought about the last two years. How this smaller woman changed her
whole life.

&quot;Michi-chan?&quot;

Michiru heard the shaky voice. She wanted to reply anything but she
was too tired to mumble or even to open her eyes. It was so warm and
comfortable with her Ruka by her side. Sleep had almost caught her.
Michiru felt how Haruka moved slightly. But she didn&#39;t leave.

Maybe she&#39;s looking for a better position.

At the next moment Michiru felt soft warm lips upon her own. It was a
tender touch. The light kiss lasted for a few seconds. Then Haruka
laid back on her pillow and her arms squeezed gently the smaller
senshi.

&quot;Night, love.&quot; She whispered with a quiet sob in her voice.

She won&#39;t be my future but at least I&#39;ll have this kiss to remember.

Even if she doesn&#39;t remember it...

Michiru wanted to reply that she liked that kiss. That she wanted
another one. But she was too tired. She heard the silent sobs of the
taller senshi and felt the strong heart beat next to her ear.

Everything will be fine.

Michiru settled into a deep and peaceful sleep.

Now that I know that you love me, Ruka.

A smile appeared on her face while she started to dream. A wonderful
dream of a wonderful future she would be able to experience.
