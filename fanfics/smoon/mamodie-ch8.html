(a songfic spoof)

Rei was shaking inside as she and her fellow Senshi neared the 
restaurant where the karaoke machines were. She&#39;d decided that, come 
hell or high water, tonight would be the night she finally told Usagi 
how she felt. She was normally one of the bravest and most outspoken of 
the Inners, but the thought of scaring Usagi away by saying the wrong 
thing terrified her.

She was therefore nervous, and thought it best if she had someone around 
to support her when the big moment came. Also, since she had a good 
singing voice, she decided she would dedicate a song to her, and pray 
that the blond girl who stole her heart would understand what she was 
trying to say. Even if in the end Usagi stayed with Mamoru, at least 
she&#39;d have finally have told the blond her true feelings.

She&#39;d only opened up about her sexual orientation, and her crush on 
Usagi, to Minako, Haruka and Michiru. Haruka and Michiru supported her 
immediately of course; it wasn&#39;t that they had anything against Mamoru 
of course, but Rei just seemed to them to be a better match for their 
princess. It was Mina-chan, the Senshi of Love, who suggested not only 
singing her feelings to Usagi, but which song to sing. It was a song the 
blond copied off the internet for her and written by a gaijin named 
Lionel Richie. The first time she read the lyrics, Rei wept; it seemed 
like they were written for her.

&quot;I&#39;ve been alone with you

Inside my mind

And in my dreams I&#39;ve kissed your lips

A thousand times

I sometimes see you

Pass outside my door

Hello!

Is it me you&#39;re looking for?&quot;

Going in with Rei were Usagi of course (who had no idea what the Fire 
Senshi had planned), Haruka and Michiru, Ami, Makoto, Minako and, 
unfortunately, Mamoru. Rei didn&#39;t care though; whether Mamoru liked it 
or not she was going to reveal to Usagi her true feelings. After they 
were shown their semi-private table at the restaurant near the lobster 
tank and small karaoke machine, Usagi was the first to get up to use the 
machine, singing an off-key song about moonlight and midnight. Next was 
Mina-chan singing some song from an anime. Finally it was Rei&#39;s turn. 
She turned to look at Haruka and Michiru, who both gave her a thumbs up. 
They were such a beautiful couple; Rei couldn&#39;t help but hope that she 
and Usagi-chan could share the same type of closeness. She got up as 
Mina-chan pushed the button for the song.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; she began nervously, trying not to hyperventilate, &quot;I... 
Um... I&#39;m dedicating this song to someone very special to me, um... 
Usagi-chan, this... this song is for you.&quot; she said, blushing 
uncharacteristically at the end of the tribute. As Usagi looked on 
pleasantly surprised to find a song dedicated to her, the music began.

The WRONG music.

&quot;Oh no.&quot; Minako groaned as she realized she pushed the wrong button. As 
the lyrics began to appear on the teleprompter, Rei&#39;s jaw dropped. But 
as the music got louder and the spotlight fell upon her, she realized it 
was too late to back out of this fiasco now. Her face turned beet red as 
she began to sing.

&quot;You need my love baby, oh so bad

You&#39;re not the only one I&#39;ve ever had

And if I say I wanna set you free

Don&#39;t you know you&#39;ll live in misery

They call me (Dr. Love)

They call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love)

I&#39;ve got the cure you&#39;re thinkin&#39; of (calling Dr. Love)&quot;

Rei&#39;s hands were sweating and she felt her stomach sinking as she 
continued singing the incredibly lewd song, all the while plotting how 
she was going to kill Mina-chan.

&quot;...So if you please, get on your knees

There are no bills, there are no fees...&quot;

Minako sweatdropped as Michiru gave the blond a dirty look. Haruka 
meanwhile was fighting the urge to snicker at the complete absurdity of 
Rei singing the KISS song &quot;Dr. Love.&quot; Finally, after five of the longest 
moments of Rei&#39;s life, the music ended.

As the spotlight faded and the lights came back on, Rei could see Ami, 
Makoto and Mamoru staring at her in shock. She felt terrible, certain 
that Usagi-chan would be turned off completely by her little show. As 
she continued to plot all the ways she&#39;d make Mina&#39;s life a living hell 
for this disaster, she walked over to Usagi with her head hung low.

&quot;U... Usagi-chan.&quot; she began as she fought back the tears, &quot;I... I&#39;m so 
sorry, I...&quot; she stopped when she saw Usagi staring at her through half 
closed eyes, a smile teasing her lips.

&quot;Usagi-chan?&quot; Rei asked nervously. Her princess and fellow Senshi didn&#39;t 
answer as she slowly licked her lips while staring intensely at the 
young woman.

&quot;Usagi, I...&quot; she was cut off as a sound resembling a panther&#39;s growl 
escaped Usagi-chan&#39;s lips. Before Rei knew what was happening, Usagi had 
grabbed her and pulled her forcefully over to her.

&quot;Usagi-chan!&quot; Rei shouted as her friend wrapped her arms around her, 
&quot;What...&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Usagi cried out, &quot;Oh Kami-sama yes! Rei-chan, I want you, I need 
you! Dominate me, hurt me, ravage me! You be the doctor, I&#39;ll be the 
patient!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked, not believing her ears.

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Mamoru now put in, &quot;What the hell...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been engaged to Mr. Celibacy Before Marriage over there since 
&#39;97!&quot; Usagi said, a certain desperation showing in her voice, &quot;Nine long 
years! I have needs too, damn it!&quot;

&quot;Usagi-chan,&quot; Rei began, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;I NEED SEXUAL HEALING!&quot; Usagi-chan yelled out as she pulled Rei on top 
of her and fell backward into the dining booth, pressing her lips to the 
stunned young woman.

Michiru and Haruka looked at the pair, then at each other, then at the 
pair again.

&quot;Well,&quot; Michiru said as Rei waved her arms wildly in the air while the 
sexually frustrated blond under her held steadfastly onto her, &quot;I didn&#39;t 
see that coming.&quot;

Minako, still by the karaoke machine, smiled, &quot;Uh... Yeah, it&#39;s a good 
thing I acci... purposefully chose to use that other song. I knew it 
would...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Haruka asked as Rei pushed herself up off of Usagi to gasp in 
some air before being yanked back down again, &quot;You didn&#39;t know nothin&#39;. 
That was a mistake and you know it.&quot;

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Mamoru screamed, not believing his eyes, &quot;Rei! Guys! Hey, I&#39;m 
talking here, damn it! I... I... Uh, er...&quot;

As Ami and Makoto looked on still in shock, Mamoru suddenly spouted a 
nose bleed at the sight of Usagi wrapping her legs around Rei, who by 
this time had stopped struggling and had begun to join in.

&quot;Mamo-kun!&quot; Ami shouted as she came over with a handkerchief to help 
Mamoru with his bloody nose, &quot;Hold on, I&#39;ll...&quot; Unfortunately, on her 
way over to her friend, she tripped over Rei and Usagi&#39;s legs which were 
sticking out of the booth and knocked into Mamoru, causing him to fall.

Into the lobster tank.

&quot;AAAAA!&quot; he screamed as he came up with half a dozen of the ill-tempered 
crustaceans clutching painfully onto his face with their claws. Pulling 
one of the lobsters he threw it angrily to the ground at his feet. 
Sadly, the lobster proceeded to crawl underneath the young man&#39;s foot, 
causing him to loose balance. In desperation, with the lobsters still 
clutching painfully to his face he grabbed blindly for the nearest 
object he could find in the hopes of not falling back in the lobster 
tank.

Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t work.

Equally unfortunate was the fact that Mamoru had in fact grabbed onto 
the microphone stand with the mike still attached.

ZAP!

As steam began to rise from the lobster tank, a waiter showed up.

&quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry it took me so long to come to this booth to take 
your orders but HOLY SHIT WHAT&#39;S GOING ON IN HERE?&quot;

A frightened hush fell over the room (except for where Rei and Usagi 
were, of course). Minako, Haruka, Michiru and Makoto all exchanged 
worried glances. Luckily, the brains of the Sailor Senshi, Ami, spoke 
up.

&quot;Thank God you came!&quot; she bluffed, &quot;We have a medical emergency here; 
that poor blond over there is having a heart attack! Luckily Rei, an 
off-duty nurse, was here to give mouth-to-mouth, but when this poor soul 
over here tried to make a heart defibulator with a microphone and a 
lobster tank like he saw done in a MacGuyver episode, he ended up 
electrocuting himself!&quot;

The waiter looked at Ami for a few seconds, then nodded, &quot;Right, what 
can I do to help?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s too late to save poor Mamoru, but Nurse Rei still has a chance to 
save our friend Usagi-chan, provided she&#39;s uninterrupted for at least 
fifteen minutes.&quot;

&quot;I see, I... Wait a minute,&quot; the waiter said suspiciously, &quot;That doesn&#39;t 
look like any CPR I&#39;m familiar with.&quot;

Ami looked over to her two friends going at it and sweatdropped.

&quot;Er... Uh... That&#39;s deep heart compression she&#39;s delivering to the young 
lady&#39;s chest.&quot;

&quot;Oh, of course. I&#39;ll make sure Nurse Rei is left alone. Meanwhile I&#39;ll 
contact the undertaker for the young man.&quot; The waiter said as he ran out 
of the room. Ami smiled.

&quot;Dumbass.&quot; she quipped.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Michiru said, visibly impressed, &quot;You saved the day!&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Ami said as she blushed adorably, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Of course she did.&quot; Makoto spoke up, &quot;That&#39;s one of the things I love 
about her, I... Oh crap, did I just say that out loud?&quot;

&quot;Yes, you did.&quot; Ami said, &quot;And I&#39;m glad you did. I... I love you too.&quot;

&quot;Ami!&quot;

&quot;Makoto!&quot;

The two exchanged a tender kiss. Meanwhile, Rei and Usagi...

&quot;Psst.&quot; Minako said.

Ahem, like I said, meanwhile Rei and...

&quot;Psst.&quot; Minako said, interrupting again, &quot;Hey, narrator, psst.&quot;

Mina chan, what in the hell are you doing? You&#39;re not allowed to break 
the fourth wall! And anyways, I was just about to tell the audience what 
Rei-chan and Usagi were up to.

&quot;I know, but unless you want this to be turned into a lemon and get all 
of us kicked upstairs into the adult fanfiction section of this site, 
I... Hey, keep it down over there! Anyways, you might be better off 
leaving the rest up to the reader&#39;s imagination.&quot;

Hmm...

Good point.

Anyways, Rei ended up with Usagi, Ami ended up with Makoto, Haruka 
stayed with Michiru, Mamoru ended up in the morgue, and Minako ended up 
saving the story from fanfiction board complaints.

&quot;Hurray for me!&quot; the cheerful blond exclaimed.
