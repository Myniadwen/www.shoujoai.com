<h1>Inner Crisis, Outer Conflict (part 3 of 9)</h1>

<a href="../smoon/innerouter-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;She took the mirror?&quot; Usagi&#39;s mind could not wrap itself around this 
fact. &quot;She doesn&#39;t want to be found?&quot; The despair she was beginning to 
feel colored her voice. She looked at her friends. Rei sat, holding 
her stomach, looking as if she was going to be sick. Minako was crying 
softly and Ami looked grimmer than Usagi had ever seen her, almost 
angry. Makoto sat with her face in her hands. 

Michiru nodded. &quot;Without the mirror, I don&#39;t know where she has gone. 
She left me a note.&quot; She took a shuddering breath. &quot;She says she has 
to do this alone.&quot; 

Usagi lost her temper. &quot;She is so stubborn!&quot; she cried angrily. &quot;Why 
does she do this?&quot; She ran her hands through her bangs in frustration. 
&quot;We could have helped her. What are we going to do?&quot; 

Setsuna looked Usagi in the eye. &quot;*We,*&quot; she said, gesturing at 
Michiru and herself, &quot;are going to find her.&quot; She held up a hand to 
forestall Usagi&#39;s protest. &quot;We called you here to ask an important 
favor of you.&quot; 

The girls all looked up at this. 

&quot;We don&#39;t know how long we will be gone.&quot; Setsuna said, &quot;But we have 
made a vow. Can you, you especially Usagi-chan, can you watch Hotaru 
for us?&quot; 

The girls sucked in their breath. The meaning was clear. Setsuna 
wasn&#39;t sure they would ever return. 

Usagi let the tears flow freely down her face. &quot;I can&#39;t let you do 
this.&quot; she said miserably. &quot;I can&#39;t let you go alone.&quot; 

&quot;You have to, Princess.&quot; Setsuna &quot;Your job is to survive, to create 
Crystal Tokyo and rule in peace.&quot; 

Michiru looked up at Usagi. Her eyes were so full of pain that Usagi 
quailed before them. &quot;Usagi-chan, when Mamoru was lost to you, you 
followed him. When Endymion was taken away, you fought for him. I can 
do no less, for I love Haruka as much as you love your Prince.&quot; she 
stood and bowed formally. &quot;I know that we leave Hotaru in good hands. 
Please raise her to be as kind and strong as you all are. I know I can 
count on you.&quot; She turned away. Setsuna stood quickly and bowed. The 
two women left the room without a backward glance or another word. 

The five girls sat for a long time, holding each other and crying.
