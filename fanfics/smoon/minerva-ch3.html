---The Silver Millennium---

The small planet had never known war or hunger. Some attributed it to 
good fortune, while others gave the credit to the rich soil which was 
perfect for agriculture. Most, however, credited it to the princess.

Universally loved by all, it was said that the ruler of the kingdom&#39;s 
beauty and kindness were matched only by her wisdom and strength. When 
Minerva was happy, her people were happy. When she felt sadness, such as 
at the death of one of her wives she&#39;d had over the hundreds of years of 
her existence, the kingdom grieved with her. The affection was mutual, 
as the Princess Minerva cared deeply for all those under her care.

Which was what made today so bittersweet.

Two months ago, the visitors came. A group of emissaries sent on a 
goodwill visit from Neptune to Pluto had been blown far off course by 
the solar winds. Their food supplies nearly gone and despair setting in 
among the ambassadors, they had somehow through sheer luck arrived at 
the tiny kingdom. With them came incredible news.

Minerva was not alone.

There were other Princesses, nine in all. Minerva sat enthralled upon 
her throne as the men and women of Neptune told her about their 
aqua-haired ruler and her love Princess Uranus, as well as stories about 
the other rulers in the solar system. And about the Queen who ruled all 
from her palace on a moon circling a beautiful blue and green planet.

When they finished, a tear of joy slowly ran down Minerva&#39;s face. She 
wasn&#39;t an orphan; there were others.

She decided then that she must meet her fellow rulers. After hearing the 
stories of them from the ambassadors, she already felt like she knew 
them. For her to be unaware of their existence and them to be unaware of 
hers was intolerable. She would see that their ship would be repaired, 
and then she would go with them.

The decision had been made two months ago, and the repairs had now been 
made. She would be leaving with them tomorrow. As she paced her state 
room and prepared to address her people, she looked once again at the 
pictures that the ambassadors had given her of her &quot;sisters.&quot; The 
silver-haired Queen and her blond child, the solemn-looking Saturn, and 
the others all gave her cause to smile. There was one hauntingly 
beautiful picture though that had captured her attention. She was 
concentrating on the Princess in the image so hard she didn&#39;t hear her 
chamberlain Maiya enter the room.

&quot;Minerva, it is time. The people await your announcement.&quot;

She nodded and began to walk out onto the palace balcony. Before she 
could cross the room though, Maiya grabbed hold of her arm.

&quot;My princess, I beg you, don&#39;t do this.&quot; the chamberlain pleaded. 
Minerva turned back to her and smiled reassuringly.

&quot;I&#39;ll only be gone a short while. And I fully trust in your capabilities 
to rule in my absence.&quot;

Maiya looked down, &quot;I know, but...&quot;

&quot;Maiya, please try to understand. There are others now. I&#39;m not alone 
anymore.&quot;

&quot;But you weren&#39;t alone before.&quot; Maiya argued, &quot;What about your people, 
and your wives?&quot;

Minerva took a deep breath, &quot;My people will always have a special place 
in my heart. And as for the wives I&#39;ve had over the years... Do you have 
any idea what it&#39;s like to fall in love with someone, to marry them, and 
then watch them grow old and die as you remain ever youthful? It&#39;s 
torture.&quot; she said, her voice cracking a bit at the end. &quot;Now please, we 
can continue this discussion later.&quot; she said as she turned again and 
walked out onto the balcony of the palace. As the crowd outside cheered 
and Minerva waved her arms to silence them so she could deliver her 
speech, her chamberlain left the Princess&#39; chamber, wiping away a tear 
as she did so.

---The Present---

Kihomi stifled a yawn as she left the hospital. The staff had decided it 
best to keep her overnight for observation, since the X-rays and tests 
had shown no anomalies. Kihomi didn&#39;t argue; she was too frightened to. 
She&#39;d never felt pain that intense in her life. The doctors came into 
her room in the morning and admitted they were baffled as to what might 
have happened. She was released, and told to notify them immediately if 
anything like that happened again.

As she hailed a cab, she gave a sigh of relief as she realized today was 
Saturday. Once she went home, she planned to take a long shower and go 
out to the mall. She&#39;d seen a coat she&#39;d liked at one of the stores, and 
she also needed to walk around and think about what had happened. She 
always found it easier to think on her feet than when she was sitting 
around inactive.

A taxi stopped in front of her, and she got in.

------

Rei&#39;s eyes slowly opened to find herself in Usagi&#39;s bedroom. Looking 
over to her left, she saw Mamoru asleep in a small chair, with Luna 
sleeping in his lap. Rising up to a sitting position, her movements woke 
up the cat.

&quot;Rei! You&#39;re awake!&quot; Luna cried out as she jumped from Mamoru&#39;s lap to 
the bed. Mamoru awoke and smiled.

&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; he asked the priestess.

&quot;A bit light headed. Where is everyone?&quot;

&quot;Well, after Hotaru&#39;s powers were unable to bring you around, we decided 
it best to bring you here. Makoto had to work at the restaurant today, 
and Ami is busy collecting data for her med school paper on the heart. 
They&#39;ll both be along later. The Outers will be around later as well. 
And as for Minako and Usagi, they&#39;re both here waiting anxiously for you 
to wake up.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; Rei murmured as Luna looked at her in concern. &quot;Chiba-san, 
get Usagi and Minako, please. We need to know what&#39;s happening.&quot;

Mamoru nodded, &quot;While I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll get you something to eat.&quot; he said 
before he left.

Left alone Luna turned to the young woman on the bed. &quot;Rei, do you have 
any idea what might&#39;ve happened?&quot;

Rei shook her head, &quot;None. I can only sense a menace coming, and I 
believe it has something to do with this tenth planet.&quot;

Just then Usagi and Minako rushed in, followed by Artemis. Luna only 
barely managed to get out of the way before the two friends hugged their 
fellow Senshi.

&quot;Rei, you&#39;re okay!&quot; Usagi shouted with joy. Minako let go of her and 
backed up a bit.

&quot;Rei,&quot; the Senshi of Love began, &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a menace coming.&quot; Rei answered, &quot;A bad one.&quot;

Luna nodded, &quot;And she believes it has something to do with the recently 
discovered planet.&quot;

Rei put her hand to her forehead as she tried to clear her head, &quot;None 
of this makes any sense. How could we not know about a tenth planet, or 
a possible tenth Senshi?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Minako began, &quot;According to Ami, the planet was located far 
beyond Pluto in a stretch of space known as the...&quot; she stopped to pull 
out a slip of paper she&#39;d taken notes on, &quot;The Kuiper Belt, which 
apparently is also home to comets, asteroids and various other large 
chunks of space rock. That, and the fact the planet takes so long to 
complete its orbit, would probably explain how we could&#39;ve missed it.&quot;

&quot;It makes sense.&quot; Artemis pointed out, &quot;An object only slightly larger 
than Pluto could very easily be hidden among such space debris.&quot;

&quot;A new planet, and a new Sailor Senshi.&quot; Usagi said with a dreamy smile. 
Rei frowned.

&quot;And a new menace.&quot; she reminded.

&quot;Rei, you don&#39;t think the unknown Senshi is the menace, do you?&quot; Minako 
asked.

The Shinto priestess shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know. The two are 
connected, but I can&#39;t tell yet if they&#39;re the same.&quot;

------

Hotaru watched as her Setsuna-mama wandered off to the back of the 
clothing store. She then turned back to Haruka and Michiru. Both noticed 
the look of concern on her face.

&quot;Hotaru, relax.&quot; Michiru said, &quot;Everything will be alright.&quot;

&quot;I wish I could be so sure.&quot; Hotaru answered, &quot;Between Setsuna-mama&#39;s 
running off yesterday, the revelation that there may be a tenth Senshi, 
and my inability to help Rei...&quot;

&quot;Calm down firefly.&quot; Haruka urged, putting a reassuringly firm hand on 
her shoulder, &quot;Rei&#39;s in no danger, Setsuna&#39;s back, and as for the 
possibility of another Senshi out there somewhere, we&#39;ll begin searching 
just as soon as Rei recovers.&quot;

Hotaru was about to say more, when she saw a familiar face near the 
store&#39;s entrance.

Saito Kihomi walked into the store through the mall entrance, an old 
green jacket thrown on over her white blouse. She had her hair up in a 
bun, with a few brown hairs dangling down around her attractive face. A 
pair of red tanned boots was just visible beneath her blue jeans, and 
she had a dark brown purse at her side.

&quot;Saito-sensei!&quot; a girl&#39;s voice called. Kihomi turned to her left to see 
one of her favorite students, Tomoe Hotaru, waving to her. She smiled 
and waved back as her student began to walk over. The child was followed 
by two people Kihomi took to be her adopted parents.

&quot;Sensei.&quot; Hotaru said as she bowed to her teacher, &quot;What are you doing 
here?&quot;

&quot;The same thing as you, I&#39;d imagine.&quot; Kihomi joked, &quot;I&#39;m here clothes 
shopping.&quot;

&quot;A-hem.&quot; the sandy blond behind Hotaru said exaggeratedly. The Senshi of 
Death blushed in embarrassment.

&quot;Oh yeah; sensei, these are two of my adoptive parents, Tenoh Haruka and 
Kaioh Michiru. Haruka-Papa, Michiru-mama, this is my Japanese history 
teacher Saito-sensei.&quot;

&quot;You can call me Kihomi, though.&quot; the brunet said, bowing respectfully 
to the two. Haruka and Michiru both returned the bow. As they came up, 
Kihomi noticed their matching wedding rings.

&quot;Hotaru-san told me she had three adoptive parents. You two must be the 
husband and wife of the trio, then.&quot;

&quot;Well, something like that.&quot; Michiru said. Hotaru started to giggle.

&quot;Hotaru-san, what&#39;s so funny?&quot; Kihomi asked.

Hotaru was about to elaborate, when Haruka gave her a stern look. It was 
one thing for their close friends to know they were a married lesbian 
couple, but they didn&#39;t know this teacher well enough to explain things 
to her. The racecar driver then turned from her daughter to Kihomi.

&quot;You&#39;ll have to forgive Hotaru.&quot; Haruka explained, &quot;She...&quot; the blond 
stopped when she realized the teacher was no longer paying attention. 
She was staring off at something behind her and Michiru, with a strange 
look in her eyes.

Kihomi saw the most ravishingly beautiful woman she&#39;d ever seen coming 
down one of the clothing aisles. She held a cell phone in her hand, and 
wore a form fitting light-green business suit, with a skirt that showed 
off her long sensuous legs. Her long hair hung down to her calves, and 
her violet eyes twinkled beneath the mall lights.

The others turned to see what was so captivating. All they saw was 
Setsuna coming toward them, folding up her cell phone.

&quot;Good news everyone.&quot; The Senshi of Time called over, &quot;Rei&#39;s awake. 
Mamoru just called, and she&#39;s doing fine. I...&quot; her voice trailed off as 
she noted the young woman standing with her family. &quot;Hello.&quot; she said, 
staring into the pretty grey eyes of a very attractive stranger, &quot;I 
don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met before.&quot; she said with a smile.

Kihomi was speechless. Her mouth had gone dry, and it felt like the 
temperature in the store had gone up a few degrees. Luckily, Hotaru 
stepped in.

&quot;This is my teacher, Saito-sensei. Saito-sensei, this is my 
Setsuna-mama.&quot;

Kihomi continued to gaze in awe at Setsuna, as the slightly shorter 
woman stared back, equally enthralled with what she was seeing. Finally 
shaking herself out of it, Kihomi bowed to her.

&quot;You... You may call me Kihomi, Setsuna-sama.&quot; she stammered out, even 
as she could feel her face turning red. What was she doing? Here she 
was, a twenty-six year old school teacher, behaving like a teenager with 
a schoolgirl crush.

&quot;Kihomi.&quot; Setsuna said. &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful name, Kihomi-sama.&quot;

Haruka and Michiru looked at the two women, and smiled as they exchanged 
knowing glances. Hotaru, beginning to suspect what was happening, looked 
over to the Senshi of Time.

&quot;Setsuna-mama,&quot; she began reluctantly, &quot;If Rei is awake, shouldn&#39;t we go 
to check up on her?&quot;

&quot;Hmm...?&quot; Setsuna asked, lost in Kihomi&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I said, shouldn&#39;t we check up on Rei?&quot;

&quot;Rei? Rei! Of course, Rei.&quot; Setsuna said, the usually mysterious and 
aloof Senshi blushing in embarrassment herself now. &quot;Yes, we need to go 
and see Rei. I&#39;m sorry to have to leave Kihomi-sama, but a friend of 
ours isn&#39;t doing well, and we have to go check up on her. Maybe we can 
talk again sometime.&quot; she said, as she began to turn around. Haruka, 
Michiru and Hotaru began to follow her out.

&quot;When?&quot; Kihomi blurted out. She immediately regretted it when Setsuna 
stopped and turned back to her. The question was way too forward, way 
too desperate sounding. Besides, she didn&#39;t even know if the woman was 
interested in girls, she...

&quot;Do you have any plans tomorrow night around eight?&quot; Setsuna asked.

Kihomi smiled. &quot;No, none.&quot;

&quot;Then lets get together for dinner maybe.&quot; the fashion designer 
suggested.

&quot;Of course.&quot; she answered, her smile widening, &quot;Dinner sounds great.&quot;

Setsuna returned Kihomi&#39;s smile warmly before opening her purse. A few 
seconds later, she pulled out a pen and a small notebook. She wrote her 
cell number down on one of the sheets and handed it to the teacher.

&quot;Call me tomorrow. We&#39;ll make arrangements.&quot;

Kihomi bowed once again to Setsuna as she took the sheet. &quot;Thank you, I 
will.&quot; she promised. She turned away, clutching the sheet with both 
hands as if it were a gold bar. She held it closer, noting with 
satisfaction that it smelled of the woman&#39;s intoxicating perfume. She 
put the sheet in her purse and went off to look for the coat she was 
interested in.

Setsuna, meanwhile, watched the teacher&#39;s hips sway as she walked away. 
She took a deep breath, and turned back to see three very amused faces 
staring at her.

&quot;What?&quot; she asked.

------

&quot;How much longer, professor?&quot; Beniko asked.

The professor turned to her and smiled, &quot;Not much longer. The machine 
should be recharged in another three hours.&quot; he said as Marika entered 
the warehouse. The redhead was wearing her usual leather jacket and was 
carrying a small box that had holes punched in it.

&quot;I see. Your machine is a complete success. You should be proud, 
Miyagawa-sempai.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, I...&quot; as the professor watched, Marika opened the box behind 
Beniko and took out a small mouse. She gripped it in her hand, and 
snapped its head back forcibly with her thumb, killing it. She then 
opened her mouth and ate the rodent.

&quot;The years and money it took to complete such a machine boggles the 
mind.&quot; Beniko added.

The professor didn&#39;t answer the blond. He simply stared wide-eyed as 
Marika killed and ate a second, and then a third mouse.

&quot;When we succeed in this endeavor, it will be in no small part thanks to 
you, and... Professor? Professor, is everything okay?&quot; Beniko asked as 
the professor began to look ill. She turned to see her partner finishing 
up her meal, and returned her gaze back to Professor Miyagawa. 
&quot;Professor, I...&quot;

&quot;What exactly is she?&quot; the professor asked, as he tried to control the 
rising tide of nausea threatening to overtake him. Marika looked over 
through half-closed eyes and frowned at the professor.

&quot;Professor, who or what she is doesn&#39;t concern you. We are after power. 
She&#39;s here to help us attain power. That&#39;s all you need to know.&quot;

The professor looked from one young woman to the other, and slowly 
turned and went back to his machine. Beniko went over to her lover, and 
allowed the silent redhead to take her by the wrist and lead her into a 
secluded area off in the back of the warehouse. From where he was 
stationed, professor Miyagawa could hear the sounds of love-making, as 
well as what vaguely resembled the sounds of a dog growling.</pre>
