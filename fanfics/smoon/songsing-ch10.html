<p><u>“<em>Because we’re human” – x. </em></u></p>
<p>“Where you think y’goin’?”</p>
<p>“A place called bed,” she meekly replied.</p>
<p>He grunted in retort.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna talk about this <em>tonight</em>,”  the insistence was apparent in Terry’s voice. Confrontation was  inevitable. And it couldn’t have come at a worse time. Minako’s head  began to throb, which only meant the onset of another headache was  closer than expected.</p>
<p>Minako pressed her thumb and forefinger to  the bridge of her nose, forcing the dull pain back. Unsteadily, she  traversed the dimly lit courtyard of Hikawa. Terry continued to press  his case, but his words were nothing more than faded babble. She didn’t  want to face him. Nor…face the fact that she was…IS <em>imperfect. </em>Minako  wished the dank surroundings would swallow every single one of his  assaulting words. Mental degradation of another had always been Terry’s  forte.</p>
<p>“Thought I’d never find out? <em>Christ</em> Minako, I know <em>everything</em> about you.”</p>
<p>Spearing  out his hand, Terry whirled her around. The force rocked her on the  ball of her feet. His free paw grappled the upper half of her right  arm, holding her steadfast; his fingers began to dig into Minako’s  flesh, biting with insane abandon.</p>
<p>“Then you <em>know</em> that I’m hurting right now, Terry – Let. Go. Of. Me,” she rasped.</p>
<p>Minako  didn’t want to appear as if she were pleading. She was above that. So  she thought. But the way Terry burrowed his gaze on her, affirmed  otherwise, Aino Minako was a terrified soul. Where was that infamous  strength that she carried so long ago, as the leader of the Senshi? No  amount of her struggling rekindled that. The only place that held it  was along side her compliment. The Yin to her Yang. Her frantic search  in Hikawa’s shadowed expanse with her naked eyes berthed no savior. Rei  wouldn’t be coming.</p>
<p>“Shut the hell up! You have <em>no</em> fucking right to say you’re <em>hurting</em>…You…you have to <em>right, </em>Minako…none.”</p>
<p>Terry let his grip tautly <em>bound </em>about  her wrists, forcing her arms and folding it to the small of her back.  She had never seen this part of him come to fruition – there were  instances, but because they were one of Tinsel Town’s <em>IT</em> celebrities, the limelight sedated him, holding that part of him at  bay. Terry’s once serene Hazel flecked eyes turned dour, it stripped  her to her core even before his words of broken trust were spewed.</p>
<p>“…you forget who you promised yourself to? HUH? I ain’t playin’ <em>your </em>fool, Minako.”</p>
<p>“Please…just let me go,” her plea came straight from her heart, and she had hoped Terry <em>listened</em>. If he truly loved her, he would have granted her this one request. All she was hoping for…was her <em>happiness.</em></p>
<p>Isn’t that how most of her romance novels ended?</p>
<p>He was burning from the inside, he couldn’t understand why she would do this, why would she treat him <em>this way</em>.  After walking the ends of the world to be with her, to protect her for  so long…She had to see. There was no logical reason in the world that  they aren’t to be together. Terry loosened his grip. He wouldn’t be  like the last asshole she was with.</p>
<p>Terry loved her. Terry needed her like he needed to breathe.</p>
<p>She just needed to be reminded.</p>
<p>Stuffing  his mammoth paw into the pit of his jeans pocket, Terry fished for the  thing that bound her to him. As it goes…the best defense is to give THE  best offense. The tiny object glinted in the available moonlit night.  Its austere was impeccable. Pristine in its Silver-Gold shine he  recalled the sales woman tearing at the mere site. But in hindsight,  she may have been crying for utter <em>rapture</em> with the commission  she was about to make. Adorning the trinket was a perfectly cut diamond  that was born in the mineshafts of India – According to the sales woman.</p>
<p>“…For some reason – <em>this</em> was hiding in your makeup kit.”</p>
<p>Minako’s  eyes instantly glistened and the full impact tackled her and left the  Singer winded. A few months before, she was asked a question. And under  the expectant media glare her tentative answer was whispered. It was  everything she wanted, the excitement of being asked on bended knee,  the way she was romanced; the Senshi of Love and Beauty <em>had</em> her happy ending... it was all she had looked for, all she needed. <em>At that time.</em></p>
<p><em>Got you.</em> Terry should have been an actor. He injected the right amount of raspy  hurt mixing it with a glob of accusation. Furthering the guilt that  began seeding its way into the Singer. He continued, pulling her left  hand towards him then he slipped the ring unto her finger.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t want you to forget your <em>promise</em>,  Minako…”, The Football player, was a soldier of the grid-iron a  profession that forced its combatants to understand and execute  specified strategy. No holds barred, where only the reaping of your  victory wins the coveted prize. You need to know your opponent. You  need to know how to dominate them. You need to KNOW their weaknesses.</p>
<p>Hers  was her word, her loyalty…and the fact that she loved the spotlight –  Everyone knows that to maintain that important status quo…There would  be sacrifices. Minako met the rigors of life under the lens. She  was…the media darling that never did wrong. There was no way…Aino  Minako would misstep now. Terry knew this.</p>
<p>His actions laid down  the ultimatum and put her Japanese honor on the line as well as her  selfworth. Chastely…he feathered a kiss to her temple and whispered,</p>
<p>“…I <em>gave</em> you a second chance at life, baby…<em>you</em> owe me this.”</p>
<p>In  little more than a glance, the Football star left Minako standing there  in the middle of Hikawa’s lonely courtyard, only her shocked silence  and the dread of the unknown was her companion. The ring was heavy on  her hand, it was so cold….so unfeeling. And she realized…most chains  that bind, are.</p>
<p>Artemis witnessed everything from the shrubbery  that lined the walkway of the temple. Words failed him for the first  time in his proud tenure as the Senshi Leader’s council – he offered  nothing more than his steadfast presence. He always would. So long as  she would allow it. Treading softly to Minako’s side, the now slightly  ecru colored plushie quietly watched his charge. He saw that her eyes  shifted ever so slightly towards his direction. Minako had an uncanny  ability to pinion where Artemis was.</p>
<p>“…Artemis…” The common greeting that she had always given her one-time guardian, slipped absently passed her lips - shakily.</p>
<p>“Hai, Minako?”</p>
<p>“…Who am I?”</p>
<p>An odd question, thought Artemis, but quietly he offered his answer, “Aino Minako.”</p>
<p>She  nodded slightly, refusing to shed tears for this situation she created  for herself. With furrowed brows, Minako stared at the precious  gemstone hugging snugly about her left ring finger.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been her for a while…</p>
<p>“...then don’t you think it’s high time you <em>were</em>?”</p>
<p>Her  nod was barely perceptible in the wee hours of midnight, but it was  there. Somehow – the motion wasn’t comforting to the cat. Minako  scooped him up, tucking him gingerly at her side. She wouldn’t meet his  glazed eyes, but tentatively offered an overshadowed smile,</p>
<p>“…Maybe the <em>next</em> time around…I will.”</p>
<hr />
In  drink, so many others have found solace and invited in the need for  escape from their stressful livelihoods. So why then, couldn’t Rei do  the same? Granted for a time, she felt the wave of tingles dampening  her senses – it gave her the rapture of serenity, with no portending  thoughts, no <em>‘voices’</em> invading her mind. But as soon as she closed her eyes nausea set in, her dreams became pronounced and blaring – that <em>special</em> ability ruled her in sleep. A talent she saw as a double blade. Were she not careful…she could go insane.
<p>This  night wasn’t any better. Within the first instances of REM, her inner  mind was wrestled from reality. In her dreams, Rei walked with no form  of her own. Malformed images dissipated with her fingertips spearing  into their bodies, only to reform in her wake. They spoke to her  constantly, sometimes with frantically mouthed words. Words she never  heard. All she was ever given were images to interpret.</p>
<p>This time, the images were crystal clear.</p>
<p>They assaulted her with freeze frames, sepia in color.</p>
<p>The miko recognized them for what they were. <em>Photographs.</em></p>
<p>Stills  of life made to look as if they were dated. One after the other they  lobbed themselves at her from the dark corners of her mind. Easily she  plucked them from the air. They were of her temple. The surrounding  bushes, the pathway…and the wooden plank slats that served as the  stairway to the main foyer of the temple. Snapshots showed two of the  current occupants.</p>
<p><em>Man and woman</em>.</p>
<p>Patiently Rei siphoned through the ‘<em>pictures</em>’. She felt her annoyance spark, “So? WHAT? It’s <em>them</em>, I get it alright!”</p>
<p>Behind rice-paper doors, she saw their definitive forms, <em>she</em> was cupping<em> his</em> face, <em>she</em> drew closer to <em>him</em>…Rei  threw the rest from her. She didn’t want to see any more as they  continuously spilled, portending what was to come. Not until a batch  later…one particular shot flittered into view, tumbling slowly in the  air, turning in full color. Carelessly it finally came to a stop at  where her feet would have been. Where the pool of pictures should have  been piled, this picture remained. Rei grasped it.</p>
<p>It was of a little child, waving goodbye. The child’s demeanor was familiar to her.</p>
<p>But  before she could scrutinize it further a scream inundated her mind, one  that was sure to have destroyed her eardrums, and one that Rei knew.</p>
<p>It was Rei’s voice.</p>
<p>Rei  jolted awake and found her left hand had gone knuckle-white from  clenching her fist. The miko’s body felt heavy, becoming uncooperative.  She heard her breath coming in ragged spurts; shaking the last vestiges  of Morpheous’ grip on her, Rei lapped at her lower lip, tasting the  salt of her sweat clinging to her plump flesh.</p>
<p>Her attentions  were drawn with the tender pads of someone’s fingers at her temple,  eventually leading to her cheek. The one time priestess forgot where  she was. Embarrassed eyes regarded the woman she rested against.</p>
<p>Ami began to work Rei’s fingers loose from the front of her crumpled blouse.</p>
<p>“I…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>A soft smile, “You should be, this <em>was</em> my favorite blouse, Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>Rei retracted her hand immediately drawing her body upright just as quickly. The miko refused to meet Ami’s curious gaze.</p>
<p>“how long was I…?”</p>
<p>“Only  ten minutes,” offered the doctor softly, “But you slipped into REM  quickly. Understandable really. You’ve had a trying few days….”</p>
<p>Raking  her splayed fingers through her hair, Rei exhaled before pulling her  weary frame from the comforts of the couch. Ami pressed a hand down the  front of her wear attempting to alleviate the wrinkles that set in. She  leaned forth bringing her body at the edge of the seat. Ami watched the  woman stand just a few feet from her warring with herself. No doubt for  the doctor, the inner soliloquy of the miko blocked everything out at  the moment.</p>
<p>Minako may have been the Senshi of Love and Beauty,  holding the title rightly so – none, at least to Ami, held a candle to  the World Icon….But in little more than a stab of lightening and that  quiet intensity Rei could steal the limelight from the Star in a  heartbeat. There was a dark beauty that the only the soldier of passion  possessed.</p>
<p>Ami was suffocating under it.</p>
<p>Clearing her throat, the doctor managed to garner a look from Rei’s eyes. She stole a breath to feed her starving lungs.</p>
<p>“You were in pain…”, murmured Ami.</p>
<p>Rei furrowed her brows in askance.</p>
<p>“…When  you cried out to her. In your sleep.” When Ami didn’t get a reply, she  pressed gently, “Was Minako-chan in danger in your <em>dream</em>?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a dream, Ami.” grunted Rei. “And..from what it looked like, she was far from <em>danger</em>…”</p>
<p>“I sense…a ‘but’ somewhere under there.”</p>
<p>Rei  chuckled, whirling about to face the doctor. Her perfectly sculpted  brow twitched upward, “…Since when did you become psychic, Ami.”</p>
<p>Nestling  back once more feeling that the ambiance changed, the slightly younger  woman folded her arms over the full of her modestly sized chest.</p>
<p>“I’m a woman with many talents, Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>She laughed. Ami was drawn that much further into the Hino mystique. If the miko asked <em>right</em> now, the doctor would have foregone men in a breath of a word. Ami  Mizuno wasn’t gay, just like she wasn’t snow-virgin white. Yet…she’s  never received any of these sensations as she did whenever in the  shadow of the miko. Ami stymied the irritance of <em>those</em> feelings. ‘Flights of Fancy.’ Easily categorized for the scientific mind and shunted aside. <em>Like they should be</em>.</p>
<p>“…You make it easy for someone like me, to read you,” announced Ami quickly.</p>
<p>“It would make you the only one then.”</p>
<p>“I’m  a doctor by profession and trained to know such things – I’d better be,  otherwise…I’m out of a job.” Ami answered with a touch of humor, before  lifting herself from the couch.</p>
<p>Rei watched her friend quietly, a  comfortable silence, that hadn’t lasted long. Soon that dream flooded  back and set the raven headed woman on edge.</p>
<p>“But.”</p>
<p>Ami scrutinized her gaze on the miko.</p>
<p>“I…could  feel everything. Taste the air…,” spat Rei. “These images were clearer  than my hearth, Ami.” She shook her head abysmally. “I saw <em>them</em>, a child, my voice…the panic, pictures on pictures, they <em>wouldn’t</em> stop coming, I couldn’t look, I couldn’t bring myself TO look – <em>something</em>, Ami is going to happen.”</p>
<p>Rei  didn’t realize she was pacing, nor that her ramble came out in such a  way that it seemed as if Rei were sputtering rather than explaining the  images that came across. Taking Rei’s hand into her own, Ami  reassuringly squeezed it.</p>
<p>“The anxieties you went through here, coupled with a restless sleep aided and abetted to the <em>dream</em>, Rei-chan. You’re under an extreme amount of stress. All you need…is some time away from the cause of it.”</p>
<p>Ami  paused to let her assessment sink in. The reality of it was, Minako was  a star…and a star accustomed to being loved from afar and having  intermittent lovers, it was a common Psyche for someone in that  stature. At least, common for stars before settling with another. As  Minako did with Terry Lapps. Ami’s logic believed that Rei was being  toyed with.</p>
<p>“No…no no no, Ami! If you’ve ever heard me before, <em>listen </em>tome <em>now!</em> I <em>need </em>you to listen.” Rei pleaded, cupping Ami’s face between her hands, she forced the young doctor to look at her.</p>
<p>“Talk to me like your god damned friend, Ami. I’m not one of your patients…”</p>
<p>The  fire in Rei’s eyes caused her knees to give beneath her. Violet flecks  of color shone in the miko’s gaze – Ami knew the woman was torn. And  asking her to keep from Minako, was…a silent, selfish wish. She pulled  both hands that cupped at her face from her, Ami remained standing  under her own will – <em>amazingly</em>. In a move that surprised even  her, the doctor found her hands listing from holding Rei’s own and  coursing her arms about the miko’s neck in a gentle hug.</p>
<p>She held  her close insofar that the doctor could feel the rapid, desperate  pummeling of Rei’s heart against her own chest. Rei needed a friend and  not a lecture, Ami failed in that. Ami didn’t realize how long they had  been standing there, nor did she care. Just this moment in her time,  her life – Rei needed her.</p>
<p>Despite her inner nay-sayings her own selfish wants, Ami tenderly whispered against Rei’s cheek…</p>
<p>“Go…I should know better than to question your <em>talents</em>, Rei-chan…If she’s <em>going</em> to be hurt…”</p>
<p>“Which is why you need to come with me, Ami. We’ll call the others en route and…”</p>
<p>Ami pulled back and effortlessly averted Rei’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Are we seriously going to debate this You need to leave…<em>now.</em> Time Rei-chan…TIME. It’s something you can ill-afford.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Don’t make that your new catchphrase,” Ami dared a glance, “The worse thing for a human to go through…is <em>never </em>knowing the ‘could have beens’. Go.”</p>
<p>Rei’s eyes flicked with acquiescence and sorrow. “Ami…”</p>
<p>“…We’ll be there for you.”</p>
<p>The  miko barely gave a nod before moving towards Ami’s entry-way. The  doctor followed quietly, obediently. Outside, Mother Nature decided a  light misting of rain just wouldn’t do, as if feeding on all the lonely  souls out there, the soft rainfall, turned into a burgeoning maelstrom.  Bucket loads of water blanketed the road. Ami’s field of vision caught  the faint outlines of the cab that Rei had come in. Its lights were  still cutting through the darkened ala X-Files-like night sky.</p>
<p>“I had him wait.”</p>
<p>Ami realized then, that Rei hadn’t intended to stay.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Rei paused looking quietly to her friend and confidant. “If the circumstances were different…”</p>
<p>“…It still would have been Minako-chan,” Ami afforded a knowing smile of sincerity, adding in a hushed tone, “Get out of here.”</p>
<p>With  a slight forced shove to Rei’s arm, the miko whirled about. She was  swallowed instantly in the downpour. Ami watched her leave before  shunting the door to her domicile closed. The obsidian haired doctor  heard the cab putter off; listlessly her forehead touched against the  smooth surface of her door. Ami’s eyes affixed themselves on her  perfectly manicured toenails and beyond them – she saw her now distant  past.</p>
<p>A smile twitched over her rosy lips.</p>
<p>“I took my chance…no regrets. Rei-chan – ganbatte ne?”</p>
<hr />
Makoto  wiped the steam haze that blanketed her bathroom mirror. A lithe digit  traced the obese flesh gracing her otherwise, unblemished skin. It  looked much worse than it had felt, quite honestly. Purple, Puke Green,  Maze Yellow and Alien Grey-Blue made for the most rudimentary  coloration that she’d ever laid her eyes on.
<p>The lanky woman  chuckled, murmuring to no one in particular, “I could be the Elephant  Man’s twin…I’ll give you that much Hino - That was a hell of a back  hand.”</p>
<p>Just adjacent to the room Makoto was in an audible snore  was heard, soon accompanied with a tinny of a whine. Splashing her face  with a handful of lukewarm water, the brunette peered out the doorway.  Lumped in the middle of the tatami floor, her fiancée was balled into a  fetal position on a futon. He had been, albeit naively, gallant that  night. Wanting to ‘avenge’ the injustice dealt to her. <em>Unfortunately</em>,  Makoto had been the first to snort her surprise. She had meant no  offense but it did cause a little friction between the pair. It made  Motoki near depressed that Makoto hadn’t had faith in him.</p>
<p>The  truth of it was…she had nothing BUT faith and the purest love for the  man. His spirit was admirable, physically though…she wore the pants in  their soon-to-be family. Motoki rustled under the layer of futon  blankets, drawing her from her reverie. Makoto knelt beside her  slumbering fiancée and began to tuck him comfortably into the mesh of  beddings. Just like a burrito, which is exactly how he preferred –  something she could never truly understand. Nor, she realized that she  wanted to.</p>
<p>A soft blue light flickered at the corner of her eye,  tearing her attentions away from her still sleeping lover. Quietly as  she could muster, Makoto made her way over towards the nightstand. The  object pulsed once again, revealing in bold print Ami’s number.  Curiously the brunette answered her cellular.</p>
<p>Motoki laid silent  for sometime allowing his eyes the occasional listing before he  forcibly refocused them on his girl’s back. She didn’t have to say  much, but by the tone of her acknowledgments and bobbing of her head –  it only meant that one of her friends had called. Motoki had always  known that if he wanted a relationship with Kino Makoto, it would also  mean marrying the rest of her ‘extended’ family. And with Usagi in the  picture…Privacy was an idea of the past.</p>
<p>The phone clicked off.</p>
<p>“…Usagi-chan?”</p>
<p>Makoto shook her head.</p>
<p>“Ami-chan,” he reasoned.</p>
<p>It  obviously had to be the good doctor. Usagi and Ami had always been the  closest to Makoto. Minako was always on the go and seemed to never have  time, even for herself. It amazed him that she even made it back to  Japan. Much less FOUND time to be with her friends. Rei…Just the  fleeting thought of the raven haired woman caused him to shudder in  apprehension. She <em>seriously</em> scared Motoki.</p>
<p>Rising to her  feet, Makoto made her way towards her clothes bureau, pulling out a  rather worn pullover. With a bit of a struggle, Motoki wormed his way  loose from his binds, albeit with a regretful sigh.</p>
<p>“Mako-chan? What are you doing...it’s late.”</p>
<p>“Which is why you should go back to sleep – I’ll be back, shouldn’t take more than a half-hour.”</p>
<p>She  regarded him from over her slender shoulder, with a truly lop-sided  smile thanks to that bulge of misshapen flesh. Motoki wiped the  remnants of sleep from his eyes, while his innards were tied up in  knots. He knew what Makoto’s stand-offish comments always stood for.</p>
<p>“What  is it this time? Usagi-chan having problems with soy-milk again? Or is  it Ami-chan calling for companionship other than her wine bottles.”</p>
<p>Makoto  sensed that behind the mask of prodding sarcasm, Motoki was tired of  this schtick. She never blamed him. How can anyone not develop an  inferiority complex? The woman knew she needed to be careful in how she  handled her pyche challenged lover.</p>
<p>“You’re not being fair, Motoki-kun…”</p>
<p>A sigh, “sumimasen.”</p>
<p>“Anyway,” Makoto slighted with an air of careful indifference, “it’s not as if we’re fighting <em>youma</em> again, we haven’t had that capability since we were younger,” she paused, “you know I won’t turn my back on them…<em>any</em> of them.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever think that <em>they</em> can help themselves, that you’re not obligated to be there every single moment?”</p>
<p>She pulled her luxurious mane into a loose ponytail, sparing a shadowed profile-glance to Motoki.</p>
<p>“I have.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“…That would be like saying, you’re not obligated to share your life with me... To tell me you love me.”</p>
<p>He sat there, shaking his head and chuckling after the realization was presented to him.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep your side of the futon warm.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she smiled coyly.</p>
<p>“I hope Ami-chan will be okay…though I have to say…She <em>has</em> been hitting that wine bottle a lot lately.”</p>
<p>“Ami-chan can handle anything, she always could; it’s not about her, it’s not about any of us except...”</p>
<p>“Ano?”</p>
<p>Her  hand touched the malformed side of her face and Motoki didn’t need to  hear the explanation. He nestled into the many layers of the beddings  he shared with Makoto. Then an unsettled sigh wrestled from his lips.</p>
<p>“She hit you, I don’t understand why you’d want to help her.”</p>
<p>“Because…physical pain can heal. What I did to her…was unforgivable.&quot;</p>
<hr />
He  gripped the steering and continued to drive. His hand, particularly the  left was still stick with a certain biological chemical that had been  excreted from his body. Ishikawa had been indulging his carnal wants  before being rudely interrupted, stolen of the ‘after-glow’. But it was  an interruption that he welcomed.
<p>Because now, she sat in his midst,  wringing her raven locks of the access rainwater that soaked it. The  woman flicked her eyes towards the rearview mirror, meeting his errant  gaze.</p>
<p>“Can you please keep your eyes on the road.”</p>
<p>“H-hai.”  Ishikawa gave pause, swallowing. Her voice alone sent waves of nerves  alight in him. The cabbie needed to hear more from her. “We’ll be there  shortly, miss. It’s a little late, do you think anyone will be awake to  greet you?”</p>
<p>“This is early for her…She’ll be awake.”</p>
<p>He arched his brow in evermore curiosity. “She?”</p>
<p>Her  eyes danced towards the window. The passing scenery was now nothing  more than a Monet like blur. “Someone that I need to see.”</p>
<p>Ishikawa’s  fingers involuntarily flexed. His eyes shifted towards the mirror. The  woman looked distant and lost, suddenly her lips twitched at a memory.  “Must be someone very important to you,” he heard his gruff voice reply.</p>
<p>Rei laughed softly, “The most important person in my life…I just wanted to tell her that.”</p>
<p>His breathing caught at the pit of his throat. <em>Someone MORE important than me?</em> <em>I brought you everywhere you needed to go, -I- gave you that escape you needed! NO ONE ELSE did that for you! </em></p>
<p>“A-ah,  soo.”, he replied simply, but the cab driver could feel it. The  jealousy began to eat at him from the inside out. Surprisingly, his  demeanor remained composed.</p>
<p>“<em>Family</em> member?”</p>
<p>There  was a pause before her contralto purr broke above the turning of the  Daihatsu’s engine. So delicate in sound, so welcoming…So perfect that  he started to wonder, how it sounded as she begged for forgiveness from  him…</p>
<p>“I could be arrested then, if I thought about <em>family</em> in any other way than <em>just</em> relation,” a chuckling scoff was proffered, “No…Minako’s more than family to me.”</p>
<p>“Is that so…Aino Minako…? The star?”</p>
<p>“That would be she, yeah….We’re here, just pull behind the base of the hill here…right.”</p>
<p>As  soon as the car came to a coasting halt, Rei promptly jettisoned  herself from the backseat. As her eyes darted towards the solitary  edifice on Hikawa Hill, she could see the light still on. There would  be no way that the miko would go without a fight for Minako. Especially  if her instincts were correct. Tearing her glance from the temple  yonder, Rei drew her gaze back towards the darkened pit of the driver’s  side of the cab.</p>
<p>“Ishikawa-san…arigato for your time and hel…he…hel..”</p>
<p>There was a pop.</p>
<p>It  was a struggle to get that final word out, even more difficult to get  past the initial shock…Rei gulped for oxygen, which seemed to refuse to  feed her lungs. She stumbled backward eventually losing her balance and  landing unceremoniously on her back. The miko tried in vain to lift her  right arm, but it was suddenly immobile. Her eyes shot up towards the  night-sky, and her first thought was how beautiful it was. Soon her  field of vision was eclipsed as her watered eyes stared into the barrel  of a quaking gun.</p>
<p>She didn’t notice, she didn’t have TIME to  notice, what with her worrying about other innocuous things that was  romantically detrimental to her future. With all her talent, the  priestess couldn’t even use them to foretell her own fate. All for  naught.</p>
<p>The word finally free-fell from her lips, clinging on to her raspy breath,</p>
<p>“…help…”</p>
<p>He  stood there, holding the gun that hadn’t ceased it’s erratic quaking,  the cabbie’s chapped lips twisted into a smile as he murmured,</p>
<p>“You’re welcome…”</p>
