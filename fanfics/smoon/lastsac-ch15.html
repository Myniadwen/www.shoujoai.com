&quot;Minako-chan!  A message for you!&quot;
 
Minako opened her door, brushing her hair behind her ears.  When she 
found herself facing her little sisters, nearly identical twins, she 
smiled.  &quot;A message?&quot;
 
The older of the two, lavender-eyed Fujiiro, handed Minako a piece of 
paper, while Gin&#39;iro, her silver-eyed twin, smiled at Rei through the 
door.  The Princess of Kasei joined her lover at the door and read the 
paper over her shoulder.  &quot;Michiru-san&#39;s party?  All of our families are 
invited?  Even these little ones?&quot;
 
&quot;And your older brother and younger sister, too.  Do you want to go?&quot;
 
&quot;To see Haruka-kun and Michiru-san fool the entire Silver Millennium?  
Absolutely.&quot;
 
Minako crouched down and smiled at her younger sisters.  &quot;How would you 
like to go to a party?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah!&quot;
 
&quot;Good.  Then go find Mother and Father and tell them to meet me for 
lunch in my garden.  You guys show up, too, and we&#39;ll suggest the 
party.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay!&quot;  Minako&#39;s sisters ran off, and the princess of Kinsei returned 
to Rei&#39;s arms.
 
&quot;I wonder why Haruka-kun invited us.&quot;
 
&quot;Why else?  To show us how to embrace our love.  I&#39;d like to see her in 
action as Duke Urakaze Haruka one more time before her identity is 
revealed.&quot;
 
&quot;How long do you think it will take Shousha-san to figure out the false 
identity, Rei?&quot;
 
&quot;Not long after the public announcement of Michiru-san&#39;s marriage.  
She&#39;ll be really angry.&quot;
 
&quot;Then we had better be there to support our friends and partners.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Saiki!  Eiki!&quot;
 
&quot;If I ask you what you want, will you leave us in peace?  We are in the 
middle of something very important.&quot;  Eiki raised his long, thin sword, 
watching Saiki&#39;s every move as he trained his younger brother.  He 
didn&#39;t even bother to look at Ken&#39;nin.
 
&quot;Haruka-kun and Michiru-san have invited us to her birthday on Kaiousei.  
Actually, they invited all four of the Inner families, including our 
parents.&quot;
 
Eiki raised his hand, pausing the lesson, as he turned to look at the 
message Ken&#39;nin held.  &quot;Is she trying to get everyone to figure out her 
secret?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know.  Maybe she just wants to see us all again.  She really 
must be lonely, without any siblings of her own.&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin pulled out the emerald necklace and let it sparkle in the light.  
&quot;We can give this to Mako-chan at the party.  And if all of the Inners 
are going to be there, we can tell them what Pluto told us.&quot;
 
The other two Kino sons nodded, watching the emerald catch the light.  
&quot;Let&#39;s go tell Mom and Dad that they&#39;ve been invited, too.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Careful; you don&#39;t want to hurt yourself.  Just go slowly until you get 
the hang of it.&quot;
 
Ami bit her lip nervously as she carved the tiny figure, making an 
animal she had only seen once from a report on Earth.  &quot;There,&quot; she 
sighed, carving the tiny creature&#39;s perpetual smile.  &quot;It&#39;s finished.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful, Ami.  A dolphin, right?  Do you want to paint it?&quot;
 
Ami nodded, smiling at her partner.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe that you do this 
so much.  Don&#39;t you ever hurt yourself?&quot;
 
Makoto held out her hand, tiny scars visible.  &quot;Wood-carving is not easy 
or safe, but it&#39;s fun to create beautiful figurines.  Like that swan I 
gave your sister.&quot;
 
&quot;She loves the things you make.&quot;  Ami looked up at the collection of 
animals on her dresser, all created by Makoto during their long 
association.  Courtship?  &quot;So do I.&quot;
 
&quot;Now you can start to make your own.&quot;  Makoto handed Ami her blue paints 
and touched the tiny dolphin.  &quot;I don&#39;t do water creatures.&quot;
 
&quot;I like them.  Maybe I can give this one to Michiru-san for her 
birthday, if you think it&#39;s good enough.&quot;
 
&quot;I think it&#39;s exquisite.  I&#39;m working on a model of Neptune.  I made 
them a wedding present, though.  Look.&quot;  Makoto pulled out a model of a 
crane flying into the sky, the waves reaching for its long legs.  &quot;See?  
Michiru-san and Haruka-kun are compatible.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s great.&quot;  Before Ami could continue, a knock on her door 
interrupted the pair.  &quot;Yes?&quot;
 
&quot;Ami-chan!  Father sent us with a message for you and Mako-chan.&quot;  
Hakuchou and Kaichou slipped into the room, smiling at their sister.  
&quot;We are all invited to the birthday party of Michiru-san, all of us.  
You, too, Mako-chan.  Are you coming?&quot;
 
&quot;Sure, we&#39;ll go.  Tell Father that we&#39;ll be ready to leave.&quot;  The twins 
left, and Ami looked up at Makoto.  &quot;Is she crazy?  Does she want 
everyone to know that she&#39;s a woman?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Ami.  But we&#39;ll find out soon.&quot;  Makoto pulled Ami into 
her arms and touched the golden chain running under the smaller woman&#39;s 
shirt.  &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;
 
Ami pulled out the necklace and showed Makoto the sapphire inscribed 
with the symbol of Mercury hanging from the chain.  &quot;It&#39;s an heirloom of 
sorts.  Every Sailor Mercury wears it.  I think it links us to our 
planet.  Pretty, huh?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah.  Do you think there&#39;s one for Jupiter?&quot;
 
&quot;Absolutely.  Every planet has one.  They&#39;re passed down from queen to 
princess.  Your mother probably still has it.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t think so.  She would have been wearing it.  Can only the Senshi 
wear them?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
 
&quot;Then Ken&#39;nin is probably taking care of it for me.  I&#39;ll see him at the 
party and ask for it.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Kazan?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, father?&quot;
 
&quot;Memo from Kaiousei.  Is Momoiro in there?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; the young girl answered, looking up from the reports she was 
skimming.  &quot;What does the message say?&quot;
 
The children&#39;s father, Akaneiro, sighed as he entered the room, his 
wife, Rikuriko, following him.  &quot;You two are far too lazy to be Hino 
children.  Look at your sister and her voyages to the other kingdoms.&quot;
 
&quot;She went to Kinsei, Father, and not for the joy of traveling.  She went 
because she couldn&#39;t stand to be separated from her lover.&quot;
 
Akaneiro crossed his arms at his son&#39;s words.  &quot;Kazan, Rei has 
constantly asked us not to talk about or interfere in her love life.  
She&#39;s promised to marry a duke or lord some day, as long as we don&#39;t try 
to separate her from Minako.  In any case, Kaiou Michiru has invited all 
of the Inner royal families to her birthday, and your mother and I have 
decided that we will go.&quot;
 
&quot;Do you think Rei-chan will go?&quot;
 
&quot;I imagine so, Momo-chan,&quot; Kazan answered.  &quot;My little sister likes 
Michiru-san a lot.&quot;
 
&quot;So do you,&quot; Momoiro teased, looking up at the oldest of the three Hino 
children.  &quot;You&#39;ve tried for her hand twice now.&quot;
 
Kazan glared at the youngest Hino.  &quot;Momoiro, that is none of your 
business.  Michiru-san was very nice and she was kind to me both times.  
All I know is that she has yet to marry and I still have a chance.  So I 
will take it.&quot;
 
Momo chuckled.  &quot;I am so glad that I&#39;m a girl.  The men come to me and I 
don&#39;t have to worry about anything.&quot;
 
&quot;Why couldn&#39;t Rei have your attitude?&quot;  Rikuriko shrugged when her 
children and husband looked up at her.  &quot;I know.  But Rei needs to think 
more about the future of our planet than this fleeting love she has for 
Minako.&quot;  Akaneiro looked up when one of his servants entered the room, 
and he and Kazan excused themselves to deal with Kasei business, leaving 
mother and daughter alone.
 
&quot;Why are you so upset about Minako and Rei?  You loved Asakaze right up 
until her wedding to Shinrai.&quot;
 
Rikuriko nodded.  &quot;I know.  But love between Senshi is painful when it 
is and it can&#39;t ever last.  I don&#39;t want Rei to go through what I went 
through before my marriage.&quot;
 
Momoiro touched her mother&#39;s arm.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about her.  She&#39;ll be 
fine.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka opened her eyes slowly, savoring the weight of Michiru in her 
arms.  The Neptunian Senshi was still asleep, her face peaceful, unaware 
of the dangers and troubles facing the pair in the future.  Haruka 
envied her sleeping wife.
 
&quot;I&#39;m not asleep,&quot; Michiru whispered groggily as she struggled to full 
consciousness.  &quot;I wish you would quit thinking about me when I&#39;m trying 
to get a little more sleep.  It&#39;s very distracting.&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;How do we do that, anyway?  Hear each 
other&#39;s thoughts, I mean.  I don&#39;t think any other Senshi can.&quot;
 
&quot;I always know when you&#39;re watching me, beloved.  I can&#39;t exactly hear 
what you&#39;re thinking, anyway; I just sense it.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?&quot;  Haruka leaned over her wife and bit her lip, concentrating.  
&#39;I&#39;m going to kiss you now.&#39;
 
&quot;Then do it.&quot;
 
&quot;You heard that?  I thought you couldn&#39;t hear my thoughts.&quot;
 
&quot;Not unless you project, baka.&quot;  Michiru smiled as Haruka kissed her, 
taking a moment to gather her thoughts.  &quot;Maybe because we went farther 
than any other pair.  We broke all rules and traditions for the sake of 
love and married.  None of the others ever did.  So we get . . . perks.&quot;
 
Haruka chuckled.  &quot;Perks?  We are in so much trouble, Michiru.&quot;
 
&quot;I know, Haruka.  But it doesn&#39;t matter.  We&#39;re bound now, for the 
present and the future.  We don&#39;t have anything to worry about, really.  
Now, let&#39;s get dressed.  We have to greet the guests.&quot;
 
Haruka reluctantly rolled out of bed, but not before caressing Michiru 
one last time.  Staring into the closet, she rifled through her suits 
and looked over her shoulder at Michiru.  &quot;What color are you wearing, 
love?&quot;
 
Michiru laughed as she slipped out of bed, covering herself with the 
sheet, far more modest than her partner.  &quot;You just like to stand in the 
middle of the room stark naked.&quot;
 
&quot;And?&quot;
 
Michiru glared at her lover as she pulled a pale blue dress out of the 
closet.  &quot;This one.  When am I going to see you in a dress, Haruka?&quot;
 
&quot;When I show you my world, I promise to wear a dress for you.&quot;  Haruka 
pulled out her dark blue suit and held it up against Michiru&#39;s dress.  
&quot;It&#39;ll do.&quot;
 
The two dressed quickly and Haruka waited while Michiru brushed her 
hair.  Kaiou Michiru glared at her partner as she walked to the door, 
annoyed at how little Haruka had to do to get ready for the day.  &quot;Why 
is your hair short, anyway?&quot;
 
&quot;It makes this duke&#39;s son thing more believable,&quot; the blonde replied 
flippantly.  &quot;I think I kept my hair short because I wanted to be more 
like my father.  Besides, with short hair, I can dress like a guy and 
attract girls.&quot;
 
Michiru stopped, hand reaching for the door handle, one eyebrow raised.  
&quot;Have you always been attracted to girls?&quot;
 
&quot;Since I saw you at Serenity&#39;s presentation.  So, basically my whole 
life.&quot;
 
Michiru smiled as Haruka joined her.  &quot;Somehow, that makes me feel 
powerful.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Knowing that I&#39;m the reason you like girls.  It&#39;s nice to know that I 
made an impression on you.&quot;
 
&quot;Always and forever, Michiru.&quot;
 
Michiru smiled at her wife&#39;s words, pausing as she opened the door and a 
stray thought hit her.  &quot;What do you mean, &#39;you&#39;re hungry&#39;?&quot;
 
Haruka started at the slim woman&#39;s question, sifting through her 
thoughts for a moment before smiling and caressing Michiru&#39;s cheek.  
&quot;Stay out of my head,&quot; she whispered.</pre>
