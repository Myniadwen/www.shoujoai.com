</p>
<p>Mid-sweep, Rei paused and nearly dropped her broom from her mitten-clad hands.</p>
<p>That  was it. That was the gesture she needed and had been desperately trying  to think up for the past few days. It was perfect. In fact, if all went  well she could even turn it into something continuous. Except, of  course, she would have to actually drive the thing when she had sworn  she never would a few years ago.</p>
<p>Rei mulled it over as she finished clearing snow from the courtyard.</p>
<p>The  snow had made for a very picturesque Christmas. Rei had even made a  snow angel just to amuse her grandfather, but after over a month of the  frozen white stuff, the beauty was wearing thin. The cold of winter  could only hide behind its poetic veneer for so long before you  realised it was just plain cold.</p>
<p>When Rei finished she went  inside and left her jacket, mitts and toque by the door. It was  supposed to snow again that night. She started a pot of rice going, got  to cooking dinner – chicken stir-fry – and had just clicked off the  stove when her grandfather came wandering into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Smells good,” he said.</p>
<p>Rei smiled. “You’re right on time, as usual. How do you always know?”</p>
<p>The  bald man grinned. “You’re not the only one the fire speaks to. Who  taught you all that, hmm?” Rei rolled her eyes as she served the rice  and piled stir-fry on top. “No, now I forget. I’m old you know. Who was  it?”</p>
<p>She let a little laugh out. “It was you, you bald coot.”</p>
<p>Her grandfather shook his head despairingly. “Though I clearly failed to teach you respect. Young people these days.”</p>
<p>Rei sat down, pointedly ignoring his well-worn complaint, and they ate in comfortable silence until Rei broke it suddenly.</p>
<p>“Grandpa, the Prelude is mine, right?”</p>
<p>The old man paused in surprise. “Well, not on paper, but yes I suppose it is.”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded and cleared her dishes to the sink to rinse them. “There’s only  a few months left. I think I’ll start driving to school.”</p>
<p>He  wanted to ask why? where was this coming from all of a sudden? hadn’t  she refused to get behind the wheel of that car? But instead, her  grandfather asked, “Where will you park?”</p>
<p>“There’s a student parking lot. All I need is to fill out a form, get a pass, and then it’s first come first serve.”</p>
<p>“Alright  then. It was just serviced and had its winter tires put on, so it  should be alright to drive, but be careful, of course.”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded and stooped to plant a kiss on top of his bald head on her way  to the front door. She retrieved her jacket and put it on before going  through the house to the backdoor. Snow crunched under her feet as she  trudged across the backyard to the garage.</p>
<p>Neither Rei nor her  grandfather often had the occasion to come out to the garage as the  tools they used regularly were in a separate shed. The door stuck a  little, but Rei butted her shoulder against it and it opened  grudgingly. Inside was parked a ’94 Honda Prelude, black, sleek and  shiny beneath a bit of dust. She wiped her thumb across the hood  ornament and kicked the firm tires a little. Then she stood back,  trying to picture a thirty-something woman sitting behind the wheel,  smiling gently and waving.</p>
<p>She nodded, and turned to go back inside. It had been mother’s car, despite being bought by him. It would be alright to drive.</p>
<p>Rei  put her coat back at the front door and went to her room. She pulled  out a binder from her backpack and pulled a sheet out from one of the  binder’s slots. It was a schedule, and it told Rei that in two days she  would be watching a volleyball game.</p>
<hr />

<hr />
“Hello?”
<p>“Minako! Where are you?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Kagura. At home.”</p>
<p>“Are you sick or something?”</p>
<p>“No, why?”</p>
<p>“I  didn’t see you after the game last night. It was mad! Toshio and Tooru  were so hammered they started wrestling and broke Hanna’s window!”</p>
<p>“Sounds like it was quite the gong-show.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it was. The neighbours threatened to call the cops and everybody took off.”</p>
<p>“Guess it’s a good thing I missed it, then.”</p>
<p>“Where were you?”</p>
<p>“At home.”</p>
<p>“At home?!”</p>
<p>“Doing my nails.”</p>
<p>“Your nails?!”</p>
<p>“I think your phone’s broken, Kagura. I keep hearing this really annoying echo.”</p>
<p>“Oh, ha ha. What’s wrong? You never skip a good fiesta!”</p>
<p>“The will to get plastered just wasn’t in me.”</p>
<p>“Chuh, please! You live to get cranked! You’re still depressed about <em>her</em>, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. Don’t be ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Right . . . If you could see me, you’d know that I’m rolling my eyes.”</p>
<p>“Oh, whatever. I’m not moping, I just don’t see the point sometimes.”</p>
<p>“The point in getting drunk and being an idiot with your friends? There is no point, Minako. That’s the point.”</p>
<p>“True. But I just wasn’t in the mood.”</p>
<p>“Look,  I know she was different. I get that, but you need to do something  about it or move on. This limbo you’re in isn’t helping anyone.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I just say this wasn’t about her?”</p>
<p>“Well <em>yeah</em>, but you were <em>lying</em>.”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, oh Kagura, I love you. Let’s date.”</p>
<p>“I’m still straight.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes. Still a pity.”</p>
<p>“You never change, do you?”</p>
<p>“Well . . . I wouldn’t say that . . .”</p>
<p>“You’re doing it again.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Brooding.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Sorry. I promise to be at the next one.”</p>
<p>“You’d better be! It’s semi-finals!!”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah it is! And once we kick ass at finals it’s nationals!”</p>
<p>“That’s right, so you’d better get your head in the game! Eye on the ball! Give it a hundred and ten percent!”</p>
<p>“Ew, stop with the sports metaphors or I’m hanging up.”</p>
<p>“Oh, be a good sport. There’s no I in team, Minako. The best defence is–”</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
The  slight breeze was flicking her hair about lazily, her bangs brushing  her skin and threatening to get into her eyes, reminding her they  needed to be trimmed. There was chatter and the white noise of rustling  leaves all around her, but it was the rational part of her mind that  pointed this out, not her ears. This was her zen. Thoughts and  observations drifted as if carried on the wind, and where Rei would  normally pick each one out and analyse them, at the moment simply  watching them pass her by was enough. If only such a state could last  longer.
<p>She breathed out, and in the moment of stillness before her  next breath, released the arrow. It met the target with a satisfying  thwack, and Rei took a second to enjoy the small victory before turning  around.</p>
<p>Politely waiting for her to place her shot was the archery instructor, Mr Sagisawa. “Nice placement,” he complemented her.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“If  you wouldn’t mind, I would like you to spend a few minutes every  practice assisting a younger student. I believe many of them already  look up to you, and would be open to advice.”</p>
<p>Rei looked over at  the other members of the archery club, and caught several quickly  looking away. “I . . . Of course. I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>And once the  teacher had ambled off, Rei let out a sigh. For nearly three weeks she  had managed to avoid almost all contact with her new club mates by  picking lanes on the ends and through her usual uninviting silence. <em>It had to end sometime, I guess.</em></p>
<p>She  checked the time, carefully unstrung her synthetic bow, and turned to  watch the other archers. Several were composed, patient, and diligent –  advanced and comfortable with the way they drew their bows and  released. Most were in the middle stages of applying techniques and  perfecting them. The boy one lane over was shooting like he wanted to  be the next Robin Hood. His arrow went flying in an arc over top of his  target.</p>
<p>“Wait,” Rei commanded, when he went to string another bolt.</p>
<p>He froze, brown eyes going wide as Rei approached. “Um, me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“I’m Kakazu Ichiro . . .”</p>
<p>“Do you mind if I help you, Ichiro?”</p>
<p>The boy’s face went red and he shook his head vigorously. “Not at all! Please, tell me everything you know!”</p>
<p>Rei  inwardly cringed at his enthusiasm and calmly went about correcting his  stance and his grip on the black bow. He was stammering and bright red  by the time Rei had him properly in position, and she frowned in mild  concern. Was he so embarrassed? He looked like he might pass out.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling well?” she enquired.</p>
<p>“Fine!” he insisted loudly. “Just fine!”</p>
<p>So  Rei dubiously continued her instructions through the eight stages of a  proper draw, adjusted his aim just slightly, and let him fire the arrow.</p>
<p>“Success!”  he cried so loudly that the track team on the other side of the field  looked over. The arrow was embedded several hand spans from the center  of the target – a distance Rei would have been horrified to miss by.  Ichiro was bouncing on the balls of his feet in an excited victory  dance.</p>
<p>Rei covered her face with a hand. “Yes, well done.”</p>
<p>“See you tomorrow, Hino!” Ichiro said cheerfully as Rei abruptly turned and retreated into the school.</p>
<p>She  got changed quickly, ignoring the curious looks of the other female  archery team members as she exited the change rooms while they entered,  and strode quickly through the halls of the school. If she got home  before five-thirty, Grandpa wouldn’t feel obligated to clean the  courtyard and she could finish that up in time to cook dinner so that–</p>
<p>She  spotted Kojima Toshio coming from the other end of the hallway, and  veered down a different corridor. And then she realised what she had  done, and a little voice mumbled in the back of her mind, rebellious  but truthful, <em>You are </em>so<em> pathetic</em>.</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
“Toshio, seriously,” Minako laughed. “We’re going to be late!”
<p>“I don’t care,” he stated with a grin. His hands linked together behind her back and pulled her to him smugly.</p>
<p>“Well I do care. <em>I’m</em> team captain, you know.” She pinched her nails into the vulnerable skin  on the inside of his elbow, and he let go with a yelp. “Go run in  circles!” she told him, pushing him off in the direction of the boy’s  change rooms for track. He trotted off, and Minako made for the gym  change rooms.</p>
<p>She almost missed it, but did a quick double take  when she spotted Rei coming out of the Phys Ed department’s office. The  miko was already walking away from her, graceful and slender and  oblivious to Minako’s presence. The blonde was seized by the need to  call out, felt her throat close, and could only watch Rei turn a corner  and disappear.</p>
<p><em>She’s still so . . .</em></p>
<p>“Minako!” the  volleyball coach barked, and Minako jumped nearly a foot. “Get changed!  If you’re late again, and I don’t care which boy it is that makes you  late, you are running suicides until you understand just why they were  named such!”</p>
<p>With a little ‘eep’ and a sheepish smile, Minako dashed off to get dressed for practice.</p>
<p>Kagura  smirked when the blonde came flying into the change rooms, whipping her  shirt off as she ran and scrambling to get her shoes off. Like a good  friend, the patient volleyball setter entered the combination to her  locker and opened it for the hyperactive team captain. In record time  they were out in the gym running warm-up laps, chuckling over Minako’s  antics.</p>
<p>“So why <em>were</em> you late?” Kagura asked.</p>
<p>Minako  scrunched her face. “Toshio wouldn’t let go. He’s like a six-foot  clingy thing that won’t stop until he’s my boyfriend. It’s soo  annoying.”</p>
<p>Kagura scoffed. “Minako, you’re the queen of clingy and demanding when it comes to relationships.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Minako nodded. “<em>I</em> need the attention. I can’t afford to be paying him any. That’s why I’m not going out with him.”</p>
<p>The  other woman frowned. “Really? I thought you liked him. You’re always  with him lately – half the school is convinced you’re together.”</p>
<p>“No, no. <em>He’s</em> always with <em>me</em>. I’m gonna have to go out with someone else just to shake him off.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t  that what got you into this problem?” Minako’s friend asked wryly. “If  I recall, Toshio was just a deterrent for Jun, who you also made out  with at a party and avoided afterward.”</p>
<p>Minako put a hand to her chin in thought as she ran. “Hmm, good point. I should find a girl to go out with.”</p>
<p>Kagura  nearly tripped. “Your logic escapes me, really.” And then a thought  occurred to her and she offhandedly remarked, “So you need to find, a)  a girl, and b) one who isn’t clingy at all.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Perfect. You know any good ones?”</p>
<p>They  stopped their run and Kagura looked at Minako flatly. “Yeah, she’s  about this tall, dark hair, and you’re clearly not over her yet.”</p>
<p>With a deflated sigh, Minako protested, “Seriously, I –”</p>
<p>“You’ve tried moving on,” Kagura said more gently. “It’s not working too well. So maybe it’s time to try the opposite.”</p>
<p>Minako  snorted. “I think not.” She called her team in to stretch and begin  drills, and if she pushed herself and smashed the ball harder than  usual it was because finals were approaching and no other reason.</p>
<hr />

Fridays,  Rei didn’t have archery club after school, but this didn’t mean she  could go straight home. The vice principal Yuumura had made her pick  two extra curricular activities, and the second had cost Rei no small  amount of pride to select.
<p>She glanced suspiciously up and down  hallways, wary of coming through this section of the school. In front  of the gym and along the corridors nearby were where the jocks elected  to stalk out their territory. It was after hours, so she was relatively  safe from their unwanted presence, but walked swiftly into the gym  office and closed the door behind her upon entering.</p>
<p>“Hi, Rei!  Come on over!” The geography teacher and manager of the volleyball  team, Ishida Toyoko, beckoned her over enthusiastically. Rei was nearly  positive the main reason for the older woman’s excitement was that fact  that she hardly had to do any work when she could assign it to Rei  instead. “You got us the hours we need?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Rei rummaged  through her bag, and slipped out a few stapled sheets of paper – the  result of several hours spent on the phone negotiating for practice  times. “Here.”</p>
<p>“Perfect, perfect,” the manager muttered to herself as she examined the times. “Nationals are in the bag for sure! Haha!”</p>
<p>The  miko cringed sceptically. “But the team still has to win cities. Aren’t  you jinxing it?” The team was on a winning streak which Rei would  privately hate to see come to an end.</p>
<p>“Nonsense, nonsense! Now, I’m going to need a big favour from you, Rei.” She attempted a pleasing smile.</p>
<p>Rei took note of it with a certain dread.</p>
<p>“In  order for the team to travel and receive accommodations funded by the  government, we have to meet their safety standards. This means that for  every three students traveling there must be one supervisor. We’re  short one.”</p>
<p>She immediately balked at what was being suggested. “I’m the same age as they are.”</p>
<p>“But very mature,” the teacher insisted. “And trustworthy,” she tacked on.</p>
<p>“I don’t think vice-principal Yuumura would like me missing more school.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already talked to him actually.” She smiled conspiratorially. “Rules can always be bent for good students.”</p>
<p>Rei  frowned. This was too much. She volunteered with the volleyball team  management confident it would mean paper pushing and little else. Until  now she’d been right. Her largest task was the one she’d just handed in  – booking hotel accommodations and gyms for the team to keep their  skills sharp during the national’s tournament. But going <em>with</em> them? No chance!</p>
<p>“Unfortunately,  my grandfather is in poor health and there is no one but me to look  after him. I can’t be away for such an extended time period.” Nail,  meet coffin.</p>
<p>The woman frowned and then shrugged. “Well, in that  case, I leave it to you to find a replacement for yourself. They’ll  need to sign this.” She handed over a waiver.</p>
<p>Rei nodded. “I’ll  have it for you next Friday.” This was met by a nod, so Rei excused  herself and left, feeling like she had dodged a bullet.</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
Her  parents were both in her room, her mother rooting through her closet,  displeased by the mess and making shocked comments every now and then  at what she found. Her father pulled his stethoscope from around his  neck, placed the ends in Minako’s ears and the held the chest piece to  her sternum.
<p>“Does that sound right to you?”</p>
<p>And then a different room materialised around her, tilted sideways and warm with afternoon sunlight.</p>
<p>It  was a Thursday. Thursday meant she was late to the shrine and tired  when she got there. This particular Thursday, volleyball practice had  been intense – the coach had decided to put them through an infernal  exercise called the beep-test to work their sprints and conditioning,  followed by wall-sits and free squats. Minako was convinced the old bag  wanted to kill them. Her legs felt ready to drop off her body.</p>
<p>This  was partially why napping was so nice. But mostly it was because Rei’s  lap was warm and soft and for once, the miko was letting her close  enough to put it to good use. Most of the times she tried to use the  other girl’s legs as cushions, her head got relegated to the floor.  Minako hoped this meant Rei was finally loosening up, though she had  probably simply grown tired of pushing Minako off.</p>
<p><em>Ah well, my persistence pays off either way</em>, she happily assumed.</p>
<p>“You  do remember our unit exam is tomorrow,” Rei’s voice reminded, her tone  carrying neither reproach nor concern but something that the blonde was  beginning to suspect was amusement.</p>
<p>Minako just grumbled  something unintelligible and burrowed her head down, curling her arms  around a leg like it was a pillow. Rei twitched, either because she was  uncomfortable or because the action tickled, and Minako felt the smooth  roll of defined muscles tense momentarily beneath deceptively soft  skin. Her mind was immediately sent careening for the gutter, stopped  only by the swift slamming of brakes and attempts at redirecting her  thoughts towards anything but expanses of skin and tensing of muscles.</p>
<p>“If  you fall asleep and drool on me, I’ll whoop your ass.” There was that  tone again, and now Minako was mostly certain it was amusement.</p>
<p>“Mmm, kinky,” she quipped before she could think better of it.</p>
<p>Rei’s  fist bonking her on the head could not knock out the sudden images of  whips and Rei and tight leather and oh this wasn’t going well. Usually  these kinds of thoughts weren’t too problematic because Rei was very  protective of personal space, but the miko seemed to have no idea how  attractive she was, which meant she was almost certainly unaware of the  effect she had on Minako. It was both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p>She  took a deep, steadying breath, but this turned out to be a mistake as  well. Rei smelt like a Rei should smell – all warm and sweet and maybe  a little like incense or spices or something nice. Her scent was like a  delicate version of . . . Christmas?</p>
<p>Minako snorted a brief  chuckle at the thought, prompting Rei to glance down at her  quizzically. The sight was a little dizzying to look up at – all deep  purple and elegant features framed by curtains of black. An eyebrow was  arched.</p>
<p>“Um, I have a joke for you.”</p>
<p>Rei’s expression broke into one of scepticism.</p>
<p>Minako  wracked her brain for anything she could pass off as funny. She nearly  groaned at the first thing that popped into her head but it would have  to do. “Um, why did the first monkey fall out of the tree?” She waited  for an answer.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Rei played along. “I don’t know. Why?”</p>
<p>“He  was dead. Eheh, why did the second monkey fall out of the tree?” Minako  was beginning to enjoy the joke if only because of Rei’s absolute  un-enjoyment.</p>
<p>The miko deadpanned, “I don’t know. Why?”</p>
<p>“He was stapled to the first monkey.”</p>
<p>“Why the <em>hell</em> were two monkeys–”</p>
<p>“Why did the old woman fall off her tricycle?” She pressed on, and waited with a grin for Rei to reply.</p>
<p>Gritting her teeth, Rei bit off, “I don’t know, Minako. Why don’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>“She  got hit by the falling monkeys!” Then Minako erupted into laughter at  Rei’s expression. It really was an awful joke, but telling it to Rei  was an excellent joke in and of itself.</p>
<p>“Do you <em>try</em> to be as strange as you can, or does it just come naturally?”</p>
<p>Laughter  petering off, Minako snuggled against her pillow, and realised it no  longer smelt like spices. She blinked her eyes open and looked around  her darkened bedroom, confused for a moment and then went back to sleep.</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
The  shrine had always felt like home. She could vaguely recall impressions  of a time when she had lived in a house with pale blue walls and two  stories, remembered clambering onto a couch only to fall backwards and  bonk her head on a coffee table. But that was the home her childhood  resided in. After her mother died, the first volume of her life had  abruptly ended and a new tome had begun, one with a thicker cover,  smaller print, and no colourful pictures. Rei knew she had grown up  quickly and probably into a different person than she would have been  if her mother had lived or if her father had hung around.
<p>Things were  alright, though, because her life had found a new rhythm and a  grandfather who was every bit the parent Rei needed. Things were  stable. She hated and longed for her father, yes, but he rarely called  so she rarely had to think about it. Yuuichiro popped up in the middle  of grade ten, asked her out incessantly for weeks, took a job at the  shrine much to her fury, and provided a convenient outlet for her  temper. But he always hovered at a distance, so other than sniping when  he started to get ideas, Rei could ignore his presence.</p>
<p>Then  Minako showed up, forced her way into Rei’s life much like Yuuichiro  had, but unlike the guitarist, the blonde didn’t seem to know when to  quit. She had annoyed Rei into liking her and pushed her into wanting  her, pushed until Rei had panicked and fled. Fleeing, as it turned out,  was something like blowing against the wind to try and turn it back.  All the tiny details hardly worth notice in her average day had  suddenly taken on new significance that seemed to stalk her mind into  thinking of nothing but Minako Minako Minako. She couldn’t do a fire  reading without either seeing the blonde or thinking of the day she had  unexpectedly shown up. She paused while sweeping the shrine grounds  sometimes, her ears tricking her into thinking she had heard the  swishing of a second broom. The shrine steps meant piggybacks, her room  meant Ainoland, walking home from school meant giggled conversations,  and the list went on. Minako had rocked the boat so hard it was only  now that Rei could see she had capsized it.</p>
<p>And she had no clue how to make things right again.</p>
<p>She couldn’t ignore what had happened – things had changed too much. Maybe <em>she</em> had changed too much. Regardless, that left her with the option of  either replacing Minako or regaining Minako. She wasn’t sure which  would be easier. The chance of there being another person who was at  once carefree and intense, silly and dependable and all other manner of  contradictions rolled together so flawless was slim to none. But then,  the chance of Minako wanting to be Rei’s . . .  friend-slash-girlfriend-slash-whatever was also not looking good.  Especially since Rei couldn’t even name what it was she wanted from  Minako. Wasn’t it because of Rei’s indecision that things went sour?  She blamed herself for it mostly – she was the one who overreacted, who  left, and who avoided Minako. But a small part of her insisted that the  blonde had given up too easily – there were no messages on her phone  when she got back from the hospital, no notes or emails, and when they  passed in the halls Minako never seemed to notice.</p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p>It  was nearly eleven and Rei rose creakily from her desk and put her  completed homework into her bag. She was exhausted, but thankfully her  body was steadily growing used to less sleep and more work. No Minako  and no Yuuichiro meant no help, and there wasn’t a chance Rei was  letting her grandfather chip in. Grandpa was better now, but he seemed  to move with a frailty he hadn’t before and Rei wasn’t sure if it was  real or if she was imagining it in light of his sickness. Either way,  she was twice as determined to get her chores done before the old man  could even think of doing them himself.</p>
<p>She changed for bed,  checked that her alarm was set for five, and burrowed down into her  covers. She would need some gesture to win Minako back, she mused  sleepily. Minako was the sort who enjoyed big gestures, and Rei would  teach herself how to pull one off if only for the sake of being shot  down as amazingly as possible.</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
Erika was shy, smart and  drop-dead gorgeous – or drop-sheep-eyeball-on-your-feet gorgeous,  seeing as that was what Minako had done during their first lab  together. They made an excellent team. Minako did all the chopping,  prodding, and examining during their bio labs and reported her findings  to Erika, who then did all the written work. The other girl got queasy  at the sight of blood and squishy organs, and Minako felt terribly  unwell at the thought of homework.
<p>Minako calculated that by the  middle of next, next week they would be close enough for her to ask  Erika out with a decent shot at a yes. She was interesting, pretty and  single. All good things in Minako’s book.</p>
<p>Today’s lab was a  heart, which Minako was finding mildly gross due to the jelly-like  blood clots she’d had to squeeze out. Erika sat facing the other way,  ready to take notes but not ready to look at the fleshy lump in the  tray. The girl drummed her pencil against the table while Minako read  the next set of instructions on the board.</p>
<p>“I heard you turned down Hitoshi yesterday,” Minako teased idly, hoping to get a blush.</p>
<p>Erika did blush, but retaliated, “I heard you and Hino Rei split up a few months ago.”</p>
<p>Minako  paused, her scalpel poised to slice fat away from the pericardium of  the pig’s heart she was working on. “Two months ago,” she corrected  without a thought. Erika nodded and kept taking notes. Minako raised an  eyebrow. “And you’re okay with that sort of thing?”</p>
<p>“Of course I am,” Erika confirmed.</p>
<p>Minako considered moving her plans ahead a week.</p>
<p>“She’s in the archery club with me. I can see why you liked her,” the brunette commented.</p>
<p>The information felt like a blow, and she repeated, “Rei’s in archery club?”</p>
<p>Erika’s  large dark eyes lit up. “She’s amazing. I swear she measures her  success by millimetres, and she even managed to make the buffoon on our  team, Ichiro into a respectable shot.”</p>
<p>Minako forced her lips into a grin. “You like her.”</p>
<p>Erika smiled and blushed the slightest bit. “Everybody on the team likes her even though she barely talks to any of us.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“And you went out with her. What’s she like?”</p>
<p>They  had both forgotten the lab for now, Erika due to her eagerness to hear  about Rei, and Minako . . . could practically hear Kagura’s voice in  her head, crowing in triumph.</p>
<p>“She’s . . .” <em>too good for you!! a horrible bitch – you wouldn’t like her. so intense it burns to be near her. </em>“She’s  hard to approach at first, but uh, but really nice when you get to know  her.” She nearly cringed at how lame that description sounded and how  far it was from capturing Rei.</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Erika nodded and turned back to her work. “So what do the chordae tendineae look like?”</p>
<p>Minako put on a smile. “Well, let me just find out,” she said, and turned back to hacking up her heart.</p>

....
<hr />
The  game had ended nearly an hour ago, and only now was Minako changed and  leaving the school, a grin in place that had been there since the last  point was scored. City Champions. She would probably be grinning for  weeks. The past few weeks had been gruelling and exciting. Coach had  drilled them harder than ever and Minako had pushed her team-mates on  and pumped them so full of enthusiasm she had collapsed at the end of  every day into bed, drained but determined.
<p>And now they had won  against all comers in their division. City Champions. Ah, satisfaction  felt might satisfying. All she had to do was close her eyes and she  could see the volleyball come over the net to their side, see Kagura  move underneath it to bump the ball perfectly over to Minako. The team  captain had then taken her eyes from the ball for a split second,  calculated the other team’s positioning, watched the ball come down to  her waiting hands, and set it perfectly across the court to the outside  hitter. Game and match. Kiyomi’s spike slammed down in the undefended  corner of their court before the other team could even twitch.</p>
<p>Minako opened her eyes. Yeah, she might not stop beaming for a few days solid.</p>
<p>But  just as if to prove her wrong, she stepped out of the school and a  familiar voice called her name. A voice that was audible but soft,  accustomed to speaking only above the silence of a shrine.</p>
<p>Warily, Minako turned, and her smile gave way to cautious confusion.</p>
<p>Rei  was leaning against a car parked outside the school doors looking both  cool and nervous. It should have been impossible for jeans and a black  t-shirt to make someone look so good. Minako tried to remember that  common saying about missing someone. What was it; absence makes the  eyes grow fonder? Rei was certainly a sight she drank in readily.</p>
<p>The miko pushed herself off of the shiny black car and showed a set of keys dangling from a finger. “Want a ride home?”</p>
<p>Minako  approached, a little stunned and quite uncertain. A million thoughts  were fluttering around her head, the most prevalent being, <em>Um, what the hell?</em> “You’re talking to me again, just like that?” Rei nodded, her dark eyes  watching Minako carefully while Minako tried to figure out how to  handle the situation. “Why are you doing this?” she asked bluntly.</p>
<p>Rei  hesitated only for a moment in searching for an answer. Her voice was  firm. “Because we were friends. Because I’d like to think that wasn’t  totally ruined. Can we talk?” <em>Please</em>, her eyes said.</p>
<p>Numbly,  Minako moved towards sleek black car and let Rei open and shut her door  for her. She put on her seatbelt. She watched the dark haired girl walk  around, get behind the wheel, buckle up, and start the car. She  fidgeted.</p>
<p>After nearly two months of wanting to see her, being  around Rei again was strange and a little bewildering, tense but  achingly familiar. Minako began to have misgivings about getting into  the car. It had been instinctive to give in and trust the look in Rei’s  eyes, the steady conviction in her voice. But Minako had to wonder if  she was just going to make a fool of herself again, or if this was just  the closure they had never gotten from before. She felt anxious and  looked over at Rei, but her attention was on the road, so Minako talked.</p>
<p>“Is  this yours?” The seats were leather and unblemished, the smooth, black  dashboard fingerprint free. The car wasn’t a recent model but it didn’t  seem to have seen much use. Her question received a nod. “Why do you  walk to school?”</p>
<p>“It’s only a twenty minute walk.” Minako nodded dubiously and Rei added, “Grandpa and I don’t need a car to get around.”</p>
<p>Minako  hummed and stared mindlessly out the passenger side window at the  familiar route flying by. She nearly asked how Rei knew how to get to  her house and then remembered, <em>Oh. The party.</em> and sank a little in her seat.</p>
<p>She  heard Rei drum her hands on the steering wheel before the driver  quietly cleared her throat. “I . . . Okay, that’s not entirely true,  though I didn’t lie.”</p>
<p>Minako looked over at Rei, who used the red  light they were stopped at to look over as well. The miko’s expression  was reluctant, a little nervous, but open and earnest.</p>
<p>“The truth  is my father left this car to my mother when his career first began to  take him away from home. When my mother died, my father then passed the  car to my grandfather. It was supposed to help him look after me, but  Grandpa doesn’t even have a licence and would never take anything from  my father anyway, so it’s basically mine. And I don’t drive it because  I . . .” The light turned green and Rei returned her gaze to the road.  “I don’t like to be reminded of him either.”</p>
<p>The car accelerated  again, Rei glancing over now and then while Minako sat in silence.  Beyond the odd, accidental comment here and there, and one or two  moments when she had been persuaded to open up, the topic of Rei’s  parents had been a no-fly zone. Was this a peace offering then? An  attempt to reawaken the curiosity that had driven Minako to dive into  Rei’s life in the first place? A small part of her dared to hope that  maybe it was a promise of more, a pass not just for the show but  backstage as well.</p>
<p>Her voice broke the long silence. “When did your dad start his career?” she asked, watching Rei closely.</p>
<p>“He  was always into politics, but he became a senator about thirteen years  ago.” Rei checked her rear-view mirror and over her shoulder before  changing lanes.</p>
<p>“When did your mom die?”</p>
<p>There was a piercing glance and a noticeable pause before Rei answered. “When I was four.”</p>
<p>“What was she like?”</p>
<p>It  was like watching a time lapse of a brick wall being built up layer by  layer, Minako thought. Predictably, Rei’s reply was terse. “I don’t  remember.”</p>
<p>“Not even a little?” the blonde pressed.</p>
<p>Rei’s  eyebrows drew together and a tightness around her eyes appeared for a  moment before being furiously blinked away. “I . . .” Rei’s voice  faltered and she seemed to war with herself. Finally, she let out a  tense sigh and when she looked over again, Minako could see the  openness return as well as the nervousness.</p>
<p>They were only a few  blocks away from her house now, and Minako finally felt that getting in  the car with Rei might have been her best move all week. An even better  move than the set she had made that had won the game. She finally had  her answers. No, she wasn’t over Rei. Not by a long shot. And yes, it  was possible for Rei to truly be open.</p>
<p>She had never been so pleased to have upset someone. Her questions had hurt Rei because Rei was letting Minako in far enough to <em>be</em> hurt. Minako was being abrasive and callous and more than a little  ruthless and Rei was still going to answer her honestly, voice thick  with emotion and pain bared for her to see.</p>
<p>“She was . . .  soft-spoken and very beautiful. She used to braid my hair in the  mornings and give me piggyback rides. I remember the pale blue living  room she used to sit and read to me in . . . and I remember her kissing  my finger when a bug bit me . . . And then I remember her funeral.” She  smiled sadly, her eyebrows drawn up in the middle and a quirk to her  lips that Minako wanted to touch. “That’s all I have.”</p>
<p>Rei  trained her violet eyes forward as she pulled smoothly into Minako’s  driveway. She turned off the engine and neither of them moved to get  out of the car.</p>
<p>“Have you ever told anyone about her before?” the blonde asked softly, compassionately.</p>
<p>Rei looked away, cleared her throat, and looked back. “No one’s ever asked before . . . and I wouldn’t tell anyone else.”</p>
<p>“I  missed you,” Minako heard herself admit. The confession escaped easily,  and it felt like a weight off to have finally let it out. As an extra  reward, Rei’s eyes lightened and the sorrow in her expression  retreated, even unleashing a tentative smile.</p>
<p>Rei let out a  relieved breath and then a chuckle, and slumped back in her seat. Her  smile grew and she echoed, “I missed you, too.”</p>
