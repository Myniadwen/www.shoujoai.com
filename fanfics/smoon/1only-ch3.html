<h1>My One, My Only, My Eternity (part 3 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/1only-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&#147;My lady, we could not find the princess anywhere&#133;the palace has been 
searched, as well as the city. The last time her ladyship was seen 
was&#133;below your study window, with her court. They were waiting for 
twilight&#133;&#148; a soft British voice whispered as the small black cat who&#146;d 
said it quietly slipped away, sensing her queen&#146;s need to be alone.

Queen serenity slumped into the deep cushioned throne she sat in, 
rubbing her temples as the full meaning of what Luna said sank in. Her 
daughter knew. She knew about everything, if she&#146;d been listening. 
Pluto had left soon after they&#146;d heard a sound outside the windows. 
Apparently the guardian&#146;s loyalty was equal between her Queen and her 
Princess, if she would not tell her Queen where her Queen&#146;s daughter 
was always running off to. Worry gnawed at Serenity as she looked over 
the empty throne room. The city outside was quiet now, the cheering 
from an hour before now silenced as Lunarians got their sleep before 
the festivals that were to last until the eclipse, five days away.

&#145;If beryl doesn&#146;t destroy the kingdom first&#146; Queen Serenity thought 
cynically, her eyes narrowing.

And then there was the greatest of all Serenity&#146;s problems.

Galaxia.

&#145;She still sleeps like a dead child&#133;or should I say woman&#133;&#146; a young 
woman of about 20 thought darkly as she paced beside the prone form of 
the Moon Princess. Cascades of red-gold hair glinted in the new 
morning light as Maroon eyes flashed with impatience. Galaxia looked 
down at the surface of the pond, following patterns of Terran light 
from earth as it played across the water. She wasn&#146;t used to this. The 
girl lying so peacefully beside the waters stirred something deep 
within her and she didn&#146;t like it. Not at all.

&#145;now you&#146;re just lying to yourself&#133;&#146; a nasty little voice nagged at 
her as she stared defiantly at the crisp waters, throwing a pebble 
into it&#146;s depths as if that would destroy the reflection she saw so 
clearly looking back at her. It was like staring at someone else.

&#145;emotions&#133;why do I feel like this&#133;I should just kill her and her 
mother and let Beryl have her vengeance on this child. Endyimon should 
have been with beryl anyway&#133;&#146; Galaxia thought darkly, gripping the 
engraved hilt of her sword. She pulled it out with one strong sweep, 
moving silently to stand beside the Moon brat, holding it at ready 
above her head. In one small plunge this tormenting child would be 
gone&#133;

&#147;W-who are you&#133;?&#148;

Galaxia gasped, jumping away as one small hand lifted to touch the 
dark material of her cloak. Light blue eyes looked up at her 
pleadingly, confusion and curiosity mingling in their depths, causing 
the longing to protect her to rise in Galaxia&#146;s heart, new and old 
emotions throbbing through her veins with every beat of her heart. A 
small memory surfaced in her mind as the Princess held her hand out to 
the golden haired senshi&#133;

~ Flashback to Serenity&#146;s birth ~

&#147;Galaxia&#133;The Queen asks for you&#133;&#148; the loving voice of Pluto told her 
as the golden haired warrior sat fidgeting outside the Queen&#146;s 
chambers. Galaxia rose, walking to Pluto&#146;s side before entering the 
room with her, going over to her Ladyship&#146;s bed, where the silver 
haired woman lay holding a tiny bundle of cloth in her arms. Upon 
further inspection, the pink cloth was covering the small figure of a 
baby girl, who looked up at Galaxia with warm blue eyes, filled with 
confusion and curiosity. One tiny, perfect hand reached up, taking one 
of Galaxia&#146;s fingers in her own pale hand.

&#147;She likes you Gal&#133;do you want to hold her?&#148; Serenity asked, not 
giving the senshi any choice as she passed the tiny bundle to the 
stunned Galaxia. Dark red eyes warmed as Galaxia fell in love with the 
infant in her arms.

&#147;She&#146;s beautiful&#133;my Queen&#133;beautiful&#133;&#148;

~ End flashback ~

&#145;Simply beautiful&#133;&#146; Galaxia thought once more as she sheathed her 
sword, stepping forward to take hold of the Princess&#146;s perfectly 
formed hand. She pulled the girl up from her bed of roses, gasping out 
loud as the princess stumbled forward, into her arms. Her heartbeat 
sped up, making her feel slightly lightheaded as the smell of warmth 
and moonlight assaulted her senses. The scent of Serenity. Galaxia 
almost laughed at the sheer emotion coursing through her veins as she 
lowered her head slowly, drawing the moment out&#133;

&#147;Galaxia&#133;&#148;

Serenity seemed to snap out of the trace they&#146;d been put in as the 
chilling voice of the Time Guardian shattered the moment, causing 
Serenity to squeak and jump back, smoothing her dress down with 
delicate pale hands.

&#147;Hello Suna. Aren&#146;t you happy to see me once more?&#148; Galaxia drawled, 
leaning back against a nearby willowy tree. She slanted a look to the 
moon princess, where she stood gazing down at the lake with 
bewilderment written in her eyes as she blushed a more fiery crimson. 
Tearing her gaze from the young woman, she met the gaze of Setsuna, 
who stood glaring harshly at her.

&#147;Gal, you shouldn&#146;t be here. You were exiled. You cannot stay here, or 
you shall be killed&#133;&#148; Galaxia looked at her with amusement in her eyes 
at the near desperation in her former lover&#146;s voice.

&#147;You seem saddened by the thought. I will take the princess back to 
her mother-&#148;

&#147;Galaxia&#133;Galaxia&#133;?&#148;

Both the timekeeper and the golden senshi turned to the princess as 
she looked up at Galaxia with confused remembrance in her gaze.

&#147;Why&#133;why did you leave me&#133;when you promised&#133;you&#146;d&#133;stay?&#148; the princess 
whispered, before her eyes flutter closed, her body going limp before 
landing in the cold water of the pond&#133;
