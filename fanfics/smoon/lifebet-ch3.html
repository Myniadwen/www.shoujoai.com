<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 3 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>An hour later everyone was in their newest crowns and gowns. In 
Darien&#146;s case, his Prince&#146;s armor and crown. (now for 
descriptions..sry ppl!)

Rei (Mars): A gown with a low neckline, puffed sleeves at the top. It 
was light red and got lighter in the middle, going downward. Her crown 
was made of Mar&#146;s element: fire. Right in the middle of the crown was 
a round ruby. The sign of Mars glowing brightly with in it.

Ami (Mercury): An ice blue gown that stuck to her every curve, but 
flowed perfectly. The gown had no sleeves. Ami&#146;s crown was made of her 
element: ice. In the center was a sapphire stone. The sign of Mercury 
shimmering icily.

Lita (Jupiter): Lita&#146;s gown was emerald green. The neckline went in a 
U to her shoulders. The sleeves opened and hung just before her 
wrists. Her crown was of pure electricity. The bottom center held a 
square emerald. A thunder storm surrounding the sign of Jupiter.

Mina (Venus): Mina&#146;s gown had an empire waist. The sleeves were simple 
and short. They hung perfectly on her slender shoulders. All together 
the dress was a different shade of orange or yellow when ever she 
moved. The crown was pulsing of the element light. The sign of Venus 
itself was carved out of topaz.

Serena/Serenity (Moon): The same exact dress from the Silver 
Millennium. The crown was made of pure Moon stone. 

Darien/Endymion (Earth): Same Armor of the Silver Millennium. His 
crown was made of a stone he couldn&#146;t recognize.

Everyone was chatting when a butler came into announce their hostess. 

&#147; Presenting her Majesty, Princess Terrestria.&#148; There was an intake of 
breath when Terrestria walked gracefully in. Darien&#146;s had the cheshire 
grin back on while the girls stared in awe. Especially Serena and Rei, 
who&#146;s eyes looked as if they would pop out.

In all her glory &amp; grace stood the proud Princess Terrestria. Her gown 
was pure black. It had a straight neckline, showing her perfectly 
tanned shoulders. (think ch.1 ppl&#133;I ran out of ideas&#133;sue me!). The 
arms puffed lightly and then split medieval style at the forearm. It 
had an empire waist and panned out around her from there. Around her 
hair was a headdress made of what seemed the same stone as Darien&#146;s. 
Hanging in the middle of her forehead was a periwinkle stone. Chiseled 
in was on five-point star overlapped by a smaller five-point star.

Terrestria blushed from the attention and sat at the head of the 
table.

&#147; Do you like your gifts?&#148; Terrestria looked at the excited faces.

&#147; Definitely. I thought I would get shocked!&#148; Lita looked up at her 
crown with joy.

&#147; Terrestria did you make these?&#148; The Ice Senshi was feeling the 
fabric of her dress, obviously interested. 

&#147; Well yes actually. Each crown and dress or armor is made of material 
from your planet. It kept me busy. My headdress and Endymion&#146;s crown 
is made of a stone called Black Diamond from my planet.&#148;

Their meals were brought in then. While they ate many conversations 
went back in forth. By the time dinner was over everyone was drop dead 
tired. They all said goodnight and went to their separate rooms. 

Rei changed quickly and crept from her room to Terri&#146;s. When she got 
to the black door it was partially open and you could hear music. Rei 
stepped in. What she saw definitely surprised her. Underneath her bed 
was a half hidden Terri. The fire Senshi heard a &#145;Yes!&#146; Then a rather 
loud whack and of course the yelp of pain. Terri finally came out from 
under her four poster bed. Rubbing her head and clutching a remote. 
With amusement Rei giggled and went to help her friend up. 

&#147; Having trouble Terri?&#148; Rei couldn&#146;t help the laughter that wouldn&#146;t 
stop. 

&#147; You could say that. I haven&#146;t been here even a full 2 days and I&#146;ve 
already lost something under the bed.&#148; The two girls sat on the bed.

&#147; I knew about you. Then I often went to spy on you.&#148; Rei looked at 
Terri.

&#147; I know that. I was glad you found out. When I revived your memories, 
knowing another person would remember me other than my brother was 
comforting.&#148;

&#147; Terri why didn&#146;t you wear a crown at dinner? 

&#147; My laws are different than yours. When I am 21 and become Queen, 
then I&#146;ll wear a crown.&#148; Rei looked around the young woman&#146;s bedroom. 
It was covered in periwinkle, evergreen, and&#133;&#133;black? -how strange&#133;- 
She looked at the younger Princess. 

&#147; What is Terrestrial like?&#148; 

&#147; I&#146;ll show you!&#148; Terri got up and ran to her walk in closet. A few 
minutes later she came back with an orb. 

&#147; That is Black Diamond, my castle. When I take Endymion back with me, 
the mansion will stay here. There will be a portal to both worlds. 
That way Serenity won&#146;t kill me.&#148; Terri looked at Rei in amusement. 
The Fire Goddess merely nodded. Obviously in awe of the structures and 
plants the orb was showing her. 

&#147; Ummm&#133; Rei I hope you don&#146;t mind, but I forgot to ask my brother 
this. Are Endymion and Serenity engaged yet?&#148; Terri saw her friend 
wince. When Rei looked up her eyes were sad but she nodded no. Terri 
took this as an opportunity to ask.

&#147; How much do you really love Serenity?&#148;

&#147; More than your brother.&#148; The Fire Senshi burst into tears. Her body 
shaking with familiar sobs. Terri pulled her into a hug. Murmuring 
comforting words.

They stayed like that for at least a half n&#146; hour. When Terri looked 
down, Rei was in a peaceful sleeping state. Terri easily picked up the 
girl and carried her to her room. As she tucked Rei under the covers, 
Terri whispered in her ear: 

&#147; Life will get better.&#148;</pre>
