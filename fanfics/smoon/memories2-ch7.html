------------------------------------------------------------

I give Small Lady&#146;s odangoes a pat as I release her from a hug. &quot;Thank 
you for my history lesson, Pu.&quot; She says with a smile, as she 
curtsies.

I rise to my full height and smile down on the young princess. &quot;You 
are quite welcome. Now go on, I believe you have a ball to prepare 
for.&quot;

Her smile widens even more at the mention of the ball. It will be her 
first since returning from the 20th century for good. She has grown so 
much, now a sailor scout in her own right. Soon she will be an adult, 
and too old for these little visits. I frown slightly at the thought.

She notices my change in mood. &quot;Pu, is everything alright?&quot; 

&quot;Everything is fine Small Lady. Now go.&quot;

She smiles a final time and skips away from the gates. Her form is 
soon obscured in the mists. I sigh and turn back towards my post. I 
still have much to do before this evening. There have been some odd 
shifts in the flow of time recently. I had been running tests on them 
when Small Lady arrived for her lessons. Now that she is gone, I have 
to get back to work. 

It takes me a few hours, but I manage to isolate the anomalies and 
correct them. They were merely random tears in the fabric of time. 
Such tears occur occasionally, and if dealt with properly are nothing 
of real concern. However, repairing them takes a good deal of time. 

In fact I&#146;ve been working so intently on the repairs, that I fail to 
notice that it is well into the evening once I am finished. I have 
almost completed my final check of the time stream when I hear someone 
approaching through the mists. 

&quot;For being the Guardian of Time, it never ceases to amaze me how often 
you seem to lose track of it when you&#146;re working.&quot; A voice teases.

I can&#146;t help but smile at the taunt, but I keep my back turned towards 
you as I am resolved to complete this check before leaving. &quot;One would 
think that you would have become used to it after all these years.&quot; 

A grunt is my only response as your footsteps come closer. A pair of 
strong arms winds their way around my waist. I sigh as I&#146;m pulled into 
a warm embrace. &quot;And I would think that you would have learned that I 
will always come looking for you when you&#146;re late.&quot; You reply as you 
rest your head on my shoulder.

I close my eyes and stand there for a moment savoring the feel of your 
arms around me. To think I almost ran away from this&#133; I reach up and 
brush your cheek with my gloved hand. &quot;Give me one moment more to 
complete this check and then I&#146;ll be ready to go.&quot;

&quot;Okay, but just one.&quot; You laugh and reluctantly release me.

***

Later that night I sit in our room and watch you get ready for bed. 
&quot;Great party huh?&quot; You remark as you let your hair down. 

&quot;Yes it was lovely. But I&#146;m afraid you wore me out on the dance floor. 
Was it really necessary to get up for every waltz?&quot;

You smile at me as you finish buttoning your silk pajamas. &quot;Had to 
make up for lost time. Maybe if you had shown up on time instead of 
making me come all the way to the Gates to get you, we could have sat 
out a few.&quot; 

&quot;Oh so it&#146;s my fault then?&quot; I laugh.

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; You reply as you slip into bed beside me. &quot;Next time don&#146;t 
make me wait so long.&quot; 

I swear I will never tire of seeing you like this, so at peace with 
your self and the world. It&#146;s moments like this when I can almost 
forget that we are Pluto and Jupiter, and can simply allow you to be 
Makoto and I can just be Setsuna. 

You turn off the bedside lamp and pull me into your arms. I smile and 
rest my head on your shoulder. As I drift off to sleep, I thank the 
gods for dreams, and the love, which they can bring with them.

Author&#146;s Note: Incredibly sappy I know. I can&#146;t help it I&#146;m a sucker 
for happy endings. Well, I hoped you liked this series. I was thinking 
of doing a side story about their time in the Silver Millenium. Let me 
know what you think. Thanks for your time!
