<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>&quot;Ami-papa, where&#39;s my lunch?&quot; Chibi-Usa ran by frantically before Ami 
caught her smoothly by the back of her collar.

&quot;Here,&quot; Ami handed the pink haired girl her school bag, &quot;take it easy.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Chibi-Usa beamed.

&quot;You&#39;re looking forward to being in the same school as Hotaru, aren&#39;t 
you?&quot; Ami grinned as the blue haired girl reached for the black jacket 
that went with her schoolboy&#39;s uniform then grabbed her book bag as they 
headed to the door together.

&quot;Have a nice day,&quot; Luna called out. The black cat waited until they were 
gone before getting up and climbing out the window. She padded down the 
fire escape then out onto the street, striding away with her tail 
swaying.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Chibi-Usa bounced along the hallway to the elevator, &quot;it&#39;ll 
be fun being in the same school.&quot; She pouted, &quot;I just wish we were in 
the same classes.&quot;

Ami smiled, happy that she had finally been able to get Chibi-Usa 
transferred to the school nearby the Outers&#39; home. It had taken her and 
Setsuna some effort but she thought that it was worth it, especially 
considering the joy on Chibi-Usa&#39;s face.

The elevator doors opened into the parkade and Ami lead them to the 
little car, Chibi-Usa getting in as Ami slid behind the wheel. &quot;We&#39;ll be 
doing things a bit different this morning,&quot; she explained as she started 
the car up.

&quot;How?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked eagerly.

Ami chuckled softly at the younger girl&#39;s irrepressible energy. &quot;You&#39;ll 
see,&quot; she said as they slid out into the traffic, the car taking a 
familiar route across the city. &quot;Did you finish your homework?&quot; she 
asked curiously.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Chibi-Usa answered, looking out the window as the houses 
went by. &quot;Are we going to...?&quot; she asked eagerly.

Ami laughed as she pulled up to the house. Chibi-Usa opened the door and 
bounced out once they came to a stop, running over to the dark haired 
girl who was waiting there. &quot;Good morning,&quot; Hotaru beamed as the two 
clasped hands happily.

&quot;Since you&#39;re going to the same school now,&quot; Ami said with a smile, &quot;I 
thought you&#39;d like to walk to school together.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Ami-papa!&quot; Chibi-Usa squealed happily.

&quot;That is so cute,&quot; Michiru noted as the green haired beauty and Haruka 
opened up the front door to watch the two girl&#39;s heading off hand in 
hand down the street.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Ami smiled, slinging her school bag over her shoulder.

&quot;Setsuna&#39;s going to be annoyed that she had to go in early today,&quot; 
Haruka commented, also dressed in her boy&#39;s uniform. Her sandy blonde 
hair fell rakishly into her eyes, her slim body looking good in those 
clothes.

&quot;Wish someone had called, I would have been here sooner,&quot; Ami frowned.

Michiru smiled slightly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you can always go to the nurse&#39;s 
office at lunch.&quot; She brightened noticeably, &quot;Would you care to join us 
for our morning walk to school?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Ami grinned.

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Artemis cautioned, the white cat looking worried, &quot;there 
are some unusual signs that something is coming.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Ami agreed as Haruka locked the door and the three headed out 
together. Setsuna was actually the one who suggested them all going to 
school together and Ami had been surprised at how much she liked the 
idea.

It didn&#39;t take long for them to start encountering some of their fellow 
students, some doing mild double takes at seeing the three together. 
&quot;You really need to work on improving your image, Mizuno,&quot; Haruka 
commented dryly.

Ami chuckled softly as she answered teasingly, &quot;And here I thought it 
was being seen in public with the notorious lesbian couple.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Michiru murmured. She looked over at Ami, &quot;And at 
least your reputation for being a recluse is fading.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ami answered with a slight blush.

Haruka changed the subject with a wry smile. &quot;So do you have any more 
details about that vision you had?&quot; she asked, referring to something 
they had discussed last night at a meeting.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Ami shook her head with a frustrated sound, &quot;There were 
three shadows, what almost looked like a hand being offered and taken, 
but....&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Michiru asked softly.

&quot;There&#39;s something dark coming, but what it is I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ami 
sighed. &quot;There were also jewels involved, but that&#39;s all I can 
remember.&quot;

&quot;So the three, they&#39;re enemies?&quot; Haruka asked, her eyes narrowed 
slightly.

&quot;Don&#39;t hold me to this,&quot; Ami smiled wryly, &quot;but I don&#39;t think so.&quot; At 
their questioning looks she continued, &quot;They don&#39;t feel evil, what ever 
they are.&quot;

Michiru smiled slightly as they passed the cherry trees, blossoms 
blowing around them as the wind picked up. &quot;Friend or foe,&quot; she answered 
calmly, &quot;we&#39;ll deal with it.&quot;

They walked on to the school grounds together, heading to their lockers. 
&quot;I&#39;ll see you at lunch, maybe,&quot; Ami waved.

Haruka chuckled, &quot;Remember to see Setsuna.&quot;

Michiru smiled to herself slightly as she watched Ami walk away. The 
boyish looking young woman seemed to be completely oblivious to all the 
admiring, adoring or even lustful glances that she was getting from many 
of the other female students. &quot;You know,&quot; Michiru murmured quietly, &quot;I 
think that&#39;s part of her charm.&quot;

&quot;I just wish I had been that popular when I was her age,&quot; a smirking 
Haruka commented as they walked onward together.

&quot;From what I&#39;ve heard,&quot; Michiru murmured, &quot;you were.&quot; She took Haruka&#39;s 
arm gently as she added, &quot;So which night do you want to take care of 
Hotaru and Chibi-Usa?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Haruka blinked.

&quot;For Ami and Setsuna&#39;s next date,&quot; Michiru explained patiently, &quot;it&#39;s 
rather hard to get romantic with two young chaperones.&quot;

&quot;Do we have to?&quot; Haruka sighed. Michiru quickly whapped her on the back 
of the head and Haruka whimpered, &quot;That hurt. I want you to touch me 
gently.&quot;

Michiru leaned close and smiled, &quot;Later.&quot;

Meanwhile in another part of the school Ami slowed down with a frown. 
The young man she spotted seemed to be peering around him suspiciously, 
hanging in the shadows. Even odder he wasn&#39;t wearing a uniform, just a 
dark colored suit.

&#39;I could go report this,&#39; Ami mused, &#39;but that would get him in 
trouble.&#39; Seized by a sudden impulse she quietly slid up right behind 
him before boldly asking, &quot;What are you doing here? Visitors are not 
aloud.&quot;

&quot;Ahh!&quot; He spun around, a long black tail of hair flowing with him as he 
looked down at her in surprise. His face was oddly beautiful for a boy, 
even with the eyes wide with alarm. &quot;Well,&quot; he puffed out a breath as he 
pulled them into a concealing corner, &quot;at least you&#39;re not screaming and 
fainting.&quot;

&quot;And why,&quot; Ami raised an eyebrow as she swiftly shrugged off his grip on 
her upper arms, &quot;would I want to do that?&quot;

The young man looked at her in surprise as he asked, &quot;You don&#39;t know who 
I am?&quot;

&quot;No, should I?&quot; Ami asked dryly.

&quot;Guess we&#39;re not as popular as I thought,&quot; he murmured to himself, his 
warm smile now slightly self-mocking.

&quot;So who are you?&quot; Ami finally had to ask, feeling mildly amused at the 
young mans antics.

&quot;I,&quot; he offered his hand in a surprisingly old fashioned gesture, &quot;am 
Seiya.&quot; He paused, and not noticing any light of recognition had to add, 
&quot;Of the Three Lights.&quot;

Ami blinked, looking at him thoughtfully as she took the offered hand. 
&quot;Well,&quot; she shook it firmly, &quot;it&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot; More seriously she 
continued, &quot;I repeat, why are you here?&quot;

&quot;You know, I think I like you,&quot; Seiya smiled, &quot;I and the other Three 
Lights are transferring here in a few days and I wanted to check it 
out.&quot; He looked at her curiously, &quot;So what&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Ami Mizuno,&quot; she answered as she studied him thoughtfully.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll look forward to seeing you again,&quot; Seiya turned to walk away, 
adding over his shoulder, &quot;Miss Mizuno.&quot;</pre>
