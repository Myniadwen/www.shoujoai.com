<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/innerouter-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Haruka held Ariel&#39;s hand. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I took so long to come.&quot; 

She smiled. &quot;But you are here, now.&quot; 

Oberon took her other hand. &quot;My lady, Titania is stronger than ever 
now. We cannot fight her, but we will give you our energy if you 
need.&quot; 

Haruka nodded. &quot;I&#39;m stronger now too.&quot; she said &quot;We&#39;ll defeat her. 
Even if we have to die.&quot; her voice lowered. 

They all turned away from the figure in the coffin and walked into the 
mist. 

********** 

Pluto found Neptune gasping for breath. She handed Neptune her mirror, 
but it wasn&#39;t enough. Neptune would die, so near to herself. Pluto 
placed Michiru&#39;s hands on her staff, closed her eyes and drawing what 
power she could, transported them to the planet Neptune. 

Sailor Pluto laid Sailor Neptune on the ground, and prayed fervently 
that this would be enough. Time passed and Pluto waited. 

&quot;It&#39;s what I do best,&quot; she said bitterly. 

Neptune moaned and opened her eyes. Pluto lifted her. Neptune smiled. 
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Pluto hugged her, but said nothing. 

Sailor Neptune stood, shakily, clutching the mirror. She took a deep 
breath. &quot;Let&#39;s go save Haruka.&quot; Pluto held out her staff. &quot;So I can 
kill her later.&quot; Neptune continued darkly. 

Pluto laughed. It felt like a mountain had slipped off her shoulders. 
They could do this. 

********** 

Sailor Uranus stood in front of an evil looking tower. More memories 
crashed into her mind. Of pain, of hurt and of death. But this time, 
she knew her enemy. 

&quot;Titania! I&#39;m here!&quot; she called. There was no answer. She called 
again. Then she felt it...the slow, slow drain, the life force of her 
planet being sucked away. She could feel the planet beneath her, 
weakening, crying out. Sailor Uranus stood firm. 

Titania came through the gates of the tower. She laughed cruelly. 
&quot;It&#39;s been 1000 long, slow years. You killed me and I&#39;ve been reborn. 
You died and have been reborn. Its amazing what power love and hate 
have, isn&#39;t it? But this time you&#39;ve done my work for me.&quot; she laughed 
coldly. 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Uranus asked. 

Titania lifted a hand and Michiru&#39;s mirror flashed in it. Sailor 
Uranus gasped. 

&quot;Oh yes, Uranus. I had this planned all along. One thousand years ago 
I couldn&#39;t take your life. I don&#39;t want it anymore. This time, I want 
the life of your beloved Neptune!&quot; her voice was bitter. &quot;I want you 
to feel the bleakness that you inflicted on me...a life alone, 
unloved.&quot; 

Sailor Uranus clenched her fist. &quot;We loved you Titania. You wanted 
something I couldn&#39;t give you. Oberon...&quot; 

&quot;That weakling! He never loved me, just my power!&quot; Her voice was 
shrill. 

&quot;You&#39;re wrong, Titania. He loves you still. Even after what you did to 
Miranda.&quot; 

Titania&#39;s face lost color. &quot;You lie.&quot; She looked unsure for a moment, 
but her face hardened. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. Your precious Neptune lies 
dying, even at this moment, separated from her Talisman. And you&#39;re 
the one who killed her!&quot; her voice rose in triumph. 

&quot;No!&quot; Uranus shouted, launching herself at Titania. They met in a roar 
of energy. Uranus pulled back, wounded, but she was gratified to see 
Titania kneeling. 

&quot;You fool!&quot; Titania roared. &quot;I&#39;ve ben hoarding power for a millenia, 
power from your planet. You can&#39;t defeat me!&quot; And she threw an attack 
at Uranus that nearly crushed the Senshi. 

&quot;World Shaking!&quot; Uranus cried, but the attack did not penetrate 
Titania&#39;s defenses. Titania sent another bolt of energy that threw 
Uranus backwards. 

&quot;One thousand years of hate!&quot; Titania screamed, knocking Uranus to the 
ground with her next bolt. She leapt on top of Uranus, gripping the 
Senshi&#39;s throat tightly. Uranus struggled, but the drain of power 
increased. Uranus was losing consciousness rapidly. She began to black 
out. 

&quot;Dead Scream.&quot; came the voice echoing through the fog. Titania was 
lifted off of Uranus by the force of the attack. 

&quot;Deep Submerge!&quot; 

Titania shrieked in fury, as she fell to the ground. &quot;NO!! You can&#39;t 
be alive!!&quot; 

Sailor Pluto came into focus in the mist. Sailor Neptune stood next to 
her. &quot;I&#39;m not that easy to kill.&quot; Neptune said, as she helped Uranus 
to her feet. Looking at her lover she said, &quot;I came back with help, 
finally.&quot; 

Uranus shot her a bleak look and turned to face Titania. The three 
Senshi threw their best attacks at the spirit who stood, laughing at 
them. 

&quot;You can&#39;t kill me now! My energy is tied to the planet&#39;s - if you 
kill me, you kill your own precious planet!&quot; Her laughter rang in the 
fog like the clashing of swords. 

The Senshi stood together in silence, then all raised their talismans. 
Titania glared. 

&quot;Idiots! Kill me, go ahead. It won&#39;t last. I&#39;ll wait another one 
thousand years. Hate will always win in the end!&quot; And she struck at 
the three women with a powerful attack. The Senshi were thrown to the 
ground. 

Pluto turned towards the other two. &quot;She&#39;s growing stronger!&quot; she 
yelled. 

Uranus nodded. &quot;Then we&#39;ll have to show her what we can do...&quot; 

They stood, weakly,  and once again faced their ancient enemy. 

&quot;Hate will always win!!&quot; Titania pulled her arm back once again and 
screamed in fury. 

&quot;You are wrong, Titania. Hate can never win.&quot; came a voice from the 
mist. </pre>
