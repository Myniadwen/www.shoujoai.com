<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: This is the sequel to my story &quot;To Make You Feel My
Love&quot;. In it I brought Amy and Lita together.

---

It had been two weeks since the talent show where Amy and Lita had
declared their love for each other. For the first time that she could
remember Lita was truly happy. Looking forward to each day and the time
she would spend with her blue haired angel. Serena was ecstatic for
them and had shown herself to be a true friend to the very core of her
being. The other scouts had been very supportive and were happy for the
two of them. The night they had told everyone it was right after the
talent show and they had gathered at the Crown Fruit Parlor for a bite
to eat and to just talk for a while. When the two of them walked into
the restaurant, Lita with her arm around Amy&#39;s slender form they had
gotten a few shocked looks. Mostly from Raye, but then she always was
the first one to react to something. Mina had started giggling and
saying &quot;I knew it!, I knew it!&quot;. Trista had just smiled knowingly and
went back to talking to the others. Haruka and Michiru had
congratulated them and wished them the best. Chibi-Usa looked a little
confused but Serena and Darien told her they would explain later. Today
Lita and Amy were walking back to Amy&#39;s house because they decided it
was time to tell Amy&#39;s mother about them.

&quot;Oh Lita I&#39;m so nervous.&quot; Amy said leaning against Lita&#39;s shoulder as
they walked down the busy sidewalk. &quot;What if she doesn&#39;t approve? What
if she hates me?&quot;

&quot;Amy stop.&quot; Lita said, gently wrapping her arm around Amy&#39;s shoulder,
comforting her love. &quot;From everything you&#39;ve told us and from the times
we&#39;ve met her your mom doesn&#39;t seem the type to do that kind of thing.&quot;
Though in the back of her head Lita was worried about much the same
thing. The scouts were one thing, they were the closest thing Lita had
to a family; but Amy had a mother that was still alive. There was no
way to tell how she would react to what she was about to find out. As
they neared Amy&#39;s house Lita gave her love a quick kiss on the cheek to
to show her support and the two of them stepped through the door.

&quot;Amy is that you?&quot; Mrs. Mizuno called out.

&quot;Yes mother its me and my friend Lita. Could you come into the living
room for a minute we need to talk to you about something important.&quot;

&quot;Sure Amy I&#39;ll be right there. I can&#39;t stay long though. I&#39;m needed at
the hospital.&quot; She walked into the room to find Amy and Lita sitting
close together holding hands.

&quot;Mom, you might want to sit down.&quot; Her mother slowly sat in a recliner
close to the couch where Amy and Lita were sitting. Amy cleared her
throat and Lita gave her hand a quick squeeze.

&quot;Mother, we need to tell you something and I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;ll take
it. You see, uhm, Lita and I have been dating each other for the past
two weeks. Ever since after the hospital&#39;s charity talent show. I just
wanted you to know because you always told me that I could tell you
anything. I guess this qualified, so here we are.&quot; Before Lita or Ami
could speak anything more Emily Mizuno (AN: I&#39;m calling her this cuz I
don&#39;t know her first name and Emily works for me) walked over to a
phone and called the hospital and told them that she would be
unavailable for anything except emergency calls that night. When asked
why she couldn&#39;t come in she told them that she was spending the night
with her daughter and her daughter&#39;s friend and that she was not to be
disturbed.

Over the course of the night the three of them talked of many things.
Mrs. Mizuno wasn&#39;t thrilled but she also knew that this was making Amy
happy. As the night wore on Lita stayed and help Emily cook supper. She
was impressed with Lita&#39;s talent for cooking and commented on the
quality. As Lita was getting ready to return to her apartment Emily
Mizuno called her and Amy back into the living room for one last talk.

&quot;Lita I want you to know that though I&#39;m not entirely thrilled about
this I can see how happy Amy is with you. I think I&#39;m taking this
rather well, but in all the time we&#39;ve spent talking you haven&#39;t
mentioned your parents. How do you think they&#39;ll take this news?&quot;
Lita&#39;s shoulders fell at the mention of her parents and Amy hugged her
tightly.

&quot;Mrs. Mizuno, my parents have been dead for a long time. I&#39;ve been on
my own since I was ten. Don&#39;t ask how I pulled it off because I don&#39;t
really know that myself. I hope you can keep this in confidence because
I don&#39;t want to go anywhere. I like it here and I can take care of
myself.&quot; Mrs. Mizuno agreed and left Lita and Amy to say their goodbyes
for the night. The two shared a length kiss, filled with passion and
absolute love. They parted and said their final goodbyes for the night.
As Lita got to her apartment she found Haruka waiting for her.

&quot;Oh hi Haruka! What are you doing here so late?&quot;

&quot;Just wanted to talk. I wanted to congratulate you on getting together
with Amy. You two were meant for each other.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I feel the same way. Would you like to come in for some tea?
There&#39;s no school tomorrow so its no bother.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Lita that would be nice, besides Michiru will be talking to
Amy pretty soon. Trista wanted us to talk to you.&quot; Lita led her guest
inside and prepared the tea. As she served it Haruka began to speak
again.

&quot;Its not going to be easy you know.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I know Haruka. It&#39;ll be hard but with friends like Serena, and
the other scouts to support us it won&#39;t be as bad.&quot; Haruka chuckled.

&quot;You&#39;re probably right. If we&#39;d had people like Serena in our lives
maybe things would&#39;ve gone a little easier on all fronts, but she&#39;s not
the reason I&#39;m here. I just wanted you to know that if you ever need a
friend to talk to Michiru and I are here. We didn&#39;t have any support
for a long time. We had to tell people we were cousins if you can
believe it.&quot; Lita laughed.

&quot;As I recall Haruka you DID tell us that the two of you were cousins. I
always did think something was wrong with that story. What you were
saying and your body language told different stories.&quot;

True, true. Actually I remembered something about the Silver Millennium
I thought I would share. No, the truth is Trista told Michiru and I to
tell you about this. You and Mercury were lovers during the Silver
Millennium. That&#39;s why you&#39;re so complete together.&quot; Lita was dumbstruck
as Haruka continued. &quot;Queen Serenity was very happy for the two of you.
I think she&#39;d be pleased to know you got back together. So when&#39;s the
wedding?&quot; Haruka said poking Lita in the ribs.

&quot;Oh quiet you! I&#39;ve got some thinking to do. Can I talk to you later?&quot;

&quot;Sure thing Lita. Like I said Michiru and I are here for you if you
need us ok? Ja ne!&quot; With that Haruka left, leaving Lita with much to
consider. She decided to leave the clean up for the following morning
and went to sleep. That night she dreamt of herself following a red
string tied to her left wrist. It went past a male form. &#39;Obviously
that jerk Freddie. Creep who needs him when I have Amy.&#39; The string
flowed through mist and thunder leading her along until she was almost
able to see the outline of a Sailor Scout in a white and blue fuku,
with blue hair. To her left wrist was tied the other end of the red
string. Lita knew instantly what this meant, having Mina around you
tended to learn allot about philosophies about love. The red string
tied to two left wrists indicated soul mates.

She suddenly felt very empty, and alone. Knowing that her soul mate was
so close yet so far away, wondering if Amy was feeling the same thing.
Early the next morning Lita was on her way to Amy&#39;s house when she
bumped into the genius girl half way there.

&quot;Amy!&quot;

&quot;Lita!&quot;

&quot;We need to talk.&quot; They said in unison.

&quot;Shall we go to the park?&quot; Lita asked.

&quot;I think that would be a good idea Leets.&quot; Amy said. The two shared a
long, quiet walk to the park. Lita wrapped her arm around Amy&#39;s slender
waist noticing how well she fit at her side. She thought about the
things Haruka had told her about and spoke as they entered the park.

&quot;Amy by any chance did Michiru come to you last night and have a little
talk with you?&quot;

&quot;How did you know? Oh yes, Haruka must have told you. That was a major
piece of news dropped on us. Soul mates, that&#39;s very profound.&quot;

&quot;Yeah it is. It makes sense though. We always did work better together
than if we were working with one of the others. Except for Serena of
course. Haruka did tell me, but if I&#39;m not mistaken she didn&#39;t say
anything about us being soul mates. All she did was tell me that we were
lovers during the Silver Millennium. I found out about the soul mate
thing through a dream.&quot;

&quot;So you had it too my hearts thunder?&quot; Lita blushed at the name. Amy
had obviously been waiting to use it for a long time.

&quot;Yes I had the dream. You know what, I&#39;m glad I did because it makes me
that much happier that we&#39;re together.&quot; As they spoke they entered a
small glade filled with bluebells and pink roses. &quot;Oh my!&quot; Amy
exclaimed. &quot;&quot;How did we end up here? Its so beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Not as beautiful as you me water of life.&quot; Lita said as she wrapped
Amy in a passionate embrace. &quot;I think the memories are starting to
return beloved.&quot; Tears of joy streamed down Amy&#39;s face as the flashes
of the two of them came back to her. How they were to be married and an
alliance sealed between their home planets. Lita tightened the embrace
and the two of them fell to there knees.

&quot;Amy, I think we were given this chance because Queen Serenity knew how
much we loved other.&quot;

&quot;Lita our love now surpasses that love. We share a love like no other,
for we are soul mates now and forever.&quot; The two shared a long,
passionate kiss. Letting the emotions of their past and present selves
wash over them. A soft wind picked up mixing the scents of the
surrounding flowers into an aromatic symphony. As they kissed a woman
with long, forest green hair watched them from a safely hidden spot.
&#39;Good,&#39; she thought. &#39;Those two deserve happiness after all the
heartbreak they&#39;ve had to suffer. Amy had no idea how right she is when
she says that they share a love like no other. Its good that they
understand that. The future holds many possibilities but on orders of
Queen Serenity they will NOT be separated again.&#39; She smiled, softly
and left the two to revel in the freedom of their unconditional love,
and that day the world got a little bit brighter for two people who
were desperately in love with each other. For they had learned one of
life&#39;s most important lessons. Death cannot stop true love; it can only
delay it for a time.
