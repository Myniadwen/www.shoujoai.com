<h1>Darkness (part 25 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>Author: Well, I&#39;ve re-written this chapter, because it was  a total rip 
off last time and I felt guilty. So I wrote a whole new chapter ^^.


3 years have gone by since the battle between the slayers and the 
vampires. Things seemed to be at peace, the vampires and slayers siding 
their differences. The slayers stopped killing vampires, seeing that the 
vampires cant help by being who they are.

Seemingly, all the slayers have vanished since that battle. When several 
of the vampires had went back to check out the building, it was 
completely deserted, not a soul left inside. Even the dead bodies were 
gone, the place looked clean and brand new as if there was never an 
battle.

Setsuna had gone off and had gotten married. The man was gorgeous; tall, 
dark and handsome.  He was very sweet and took care of  Setsuna very 
well. It was about time the woman found someone to make her happy. Word 
is, she is expecting another child soon, a little boy too.

Hotaru and Rini had ran off together.  Off traveling the world with each 
other. Last time anyone had heard from them was when they had sent a 
post card from Europe, saying that they were doing well and wont be back 
for a long time. That being sent over 3 months ago.

Diana and Melvin have moved into an apartment together.  A wedding being 
planned for them by the overwhelmed Luna, who was just as excited as her 
daughter and son-in-law to be. Artemis was kind of off to the side, only 
paying for the things needed for the wedding. Anything for his little 
girl.

Not much has been heard from Molly and Amy. Lost contact with them since 
they had moved to France, Molly opening a jewelry store and Amy in med 
school becoming a doctor, something she dreamed of since she was a 
child.

As for Serena, Rei, the twins, and their girls? They moved into an 
apartment together; in the hustle and bustle of the city.  

****************

Serena walked down the streets of the city with Rei clinging onto her 
arm. She ignored the onlookers and the whispers towards her and a girl 
together, and continued her slow steady pace with her girl by her side. 
Rei&#39;s attention was upon the city, loving the lights and seeing the fast 
cars buzz by.

She wrinkled her nose, feeling something cold and well hit her nose. She 
looked up to the sky, seeing little white snow flakes drop down from the 
sky. She smiled then turned to her lover, who was also looking up at the 
sky.

Serena turned her head towards Rei, feeling the girl&#39;s  eyes on her. She 
smiled, her silver eyes clashing with her lover&#39;s amethyst colored ones.  
She turned away from Rei, seeing a nice coffee shop a little up the 
street. 

&quot;Hey Rei, why don&#39;t we get some coffee?,&quot; asked Serena, heading towards 
the direction. 

Rei nodded, &quot;Yea sure, anything to warm me up from the cold,&quot;

They headed towards the direction, sighing in relief when they walked 
inside to feel the heat warm their slightly shivering bodies. They found 
themselves some seats and a table, conversing happily. Serena raised her 
head, when an waitress came to a table with a pen and notepad in hand.

Serena&#39;s eyes widened in shock, getting an closer look at the young 
woman standing before her. A woman with aqua colored hair and matching 
eyes, hair pulled up in to a sloppy bun, &quot;Michelle?,&quot;

The woman looked down at the silver haired vampire in surprised, 
&quot;Yea?how&#39;d you know my name?,&quot; 

Serena stared at the woman in an startled awe, not being able to find 
her voice. Rei looked at Michelle and smiled, &quot;Your name tag,&quot;

Michelle blushed, looking down at her name tag, &quot;Oh yea,&quot; She regained 
her posture, ready to take the two female&#39;s orders. &quot;So what will you 
two being having?,&quot;

&quot;Umm?.we&#39;ll have two latt&eacute;s,&quot; replied Rei, nudging her girlfriend who 
was still in her awe-struck daze. Michelle looked at the girl oddly 
before turning to retrieve the orders. Rei turned to her girlfriend 
who&#39;s still glazed over eyes turned to her.

&quot;That was Michelle,&quot; murmured Serena.

Rei giggled, &quot;Yes that was Michelle,&quot;

Serena shook her head, then eyed her lover in confusion, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you 
acting as if you&#39;re surprised?,&quot;

Rei smiled, causing Serena to frown, &quot;Rei?,&quot;

&quot;I knew that she would come back Serena,&quot; replied Rei,

Serena&#39;s frown deepened, causing Rei to fall into a fit of giggles, 
&quot;Serena, please don&#39;t make that face,&quot;

She growled low in her throat becoming frustrated, &quot;Rei! How did you 
know?,&quot;

Rei controlled her laughter, sitting up her seat. She placed her elbows 
on the table, and looked at her girlfriend. &quot;Because, when a vampire 
dies, they don&#39;t seize to exist?they?hmm?are re-born,&quot;

Serena nodded, thinking it over, &quot;Does that only work for vampires?,&quot; 

Rei shook her head, &quot;No it doesn&#39;t,&quot; 

Serena nodded and smiled when Michelle broke back their latt&eacute;s. She 
said,&quot; thank you&quot; and turned to Rei, continuing their conversation from 
earlier.

&quot;So she won&#39;t remember us then, right?,&quot; 

&quot;No she wont, no one remembers their previous life, hell, we could have 
died before and never know it,&quot; said Rei, sipping onto her drink.

They both turned their heads when they heard a squeal of happiness. 
Michelle had her hands clasped together with tears in her eyes. A sandy 
blonde tall woman was holding a dozen roses with a small white puppy in 
her arms, flashing a dazzling smile.   

&quot;Oh Amara! It&#39;s so cute!,&quot; exclaimed Michelle, before she grabbed Amara 
into a tight and loving embrace. Plenty of  &quot;aws&quot; and &quot;how cute&quot; went 
around the room, causing Serena and Rei to smile.

&quot;I see Amara is back,&quot; whispered Serena, pure joy running through her. 
Her Amara-papa and Michelle-mama where back, even though they didn&#39;t 
remember her. Serena and Rei finished their drinks, leaving Michelle a 
huge tip, then left.

The snow was coming down even harder, and getting larger by each passing 
moment.  The couple walked hand in hand, heading home. Rei looked to her 
left, seeing a couple walk past. Her eyes narrowed softly, recognizing 
the woman.

She was holding onto a man&#39;s hand, smiling brightly. Serena turned to 
Rei, and saw her staring at somebody. Serena turned to her direction and 
paused in her walking. There, standing to the side, was her mother and 
father.

They were holding hands, looking at each other with an unmistakable 
loving expression. Serena smiled, her parent had found each other once 
again. Hopefully her mother wont try to kill her father?Anyway, she saw 
a snow ball come hurling towards  her. 

She dodged it and looked towards the direction it had came. She saw a 
little boy with ebony black hair and midnight blue eyes. He gave Serena 
a toothy grinned.

&quot;DARIEN!!,&quot; the boy cringed and turned, to see a larger image of himself 
standing behind him, a scolding look on his face.

&quot;Darien? You march your way to that young woman and apologize!,&quot; 
reprimanded the man.

&quot;Yes dad,&quot; replied Darien and sulked his way over. He looked towards his 
father and saw the stern look on his face, then turned towards the 
woman.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said, then turned and ran to his father. Serena and Rei 
watched as he ran off towards his dad, Serena shook her head, with a 
small grin. She turned to her lover.

&quot;Come on Rei, lets go home,&quot; The two vampires walked home, with the snow 
coming down harder, the city around them becoming white and serene 
looking.
