<p>Michiru was able to forget the night's conversation for the brief  time she walked to her homeroom with her sempai, but once there the  conversation rushed back into her consciousness. So destiny had chosen  her for this 'crusade,' eh? Well, <em>she</em> didn't chose it,  especially not after she'd contemplated all the implications of what  Pluto had told her. She wanted to be a great concert violinist and to  be a recognized artist. That was kind of hard to do when she was now  expected to find the carriers of the talismans necessary to create the  Holy Grail. Pluto wasn't simply asking her to follow some order from  the fates, nor was she simply being asked to help stop the end of the  world.</p>
<p>Pluto was asking her to give up her dreams. To set them  aside perhaps forever in order to fight this battle. And why was she  expected to fight it for her? Why couldn't Pluto fight her own battle?  More importantly, couldn't she just as well give this henshin wand to  anyone in order for them to become her agent? She could think of plenty  of girls who were older, taller and stronger than herself who would  probably jump at the chance to become Sailor Neptune. And, perhapse,  they'd be able to live with being accessory to murder easier than she  could.</p>
<p>Michiru was therefore resolved. She would not use the wand; in fact she'd <em>refuse</em> to use it. Her life was already quite fulfilled enough, thank you,  without being complicated by something like this. And when the  opportunity again presented itself, she would hand Pluto her wand back  and tell her so to her face.</p>
<p>At lunch, Michiru once again sat at  her usual seat at the popular table. Of course, when the school season  began, she had no idea of the geographic divides that invisibly  separated off this area of the cafeteria from that. She didn't know  this was the jock's table, or that was for the geeks. She simply chose  the seat because it was by the window and afforded an unobstructed view  of the small fenced in field behind the school. Because of her good  looks and obvious graceful bearing the other occupants of the table  simply accepted her as one of them. She was finishing her milk when the  conversation at the table turned once more to Aya's death the previous  day.</p>
<p>“I still can't get over it,” one of the girls said morosely,  “I mean, she was in my French class. I never hung out with her or  anything, but…”</p>
<p>“You know,” Miki said, the brunette lowering her  voice as she leaned over the table as if she were passing on state  secrets, “I think there might be a story here.”</p>
<p>“Miki,” the sophomore's sempai said exasperatedly, “You're a reporter for the school newspaper. You <em>always</em> think there's a story.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,”  another girl agreed, “She had a bad heart, and it gave out. End of  story. Not everything's a conspiracy. Isn't that right, Michiru?”</p>
<p>Michiru frowned. This was most definitely not the kind of conversation she wanted to be having right now. “Well…”</p>
<p>“Michiru-chan.”</p>
<p>Michiru  turned to see her roommate Takayo coming over with some fellow  freshmen. “Michiru-chan, I was telling some of my friends about that  trick you showed me with your violin, and they wanted to see it for  themselves.”</p>
<p>Under other circumstances, she might not have been  comfortable performing the trick in the middle of a crowded school  cafeteria, but then it would get her out of this conversation. “Very  well,” she said as she stood up from the table. She opened her violin  case, being careful not to let anyone see the want hidden in the case  as she took out her violin and bow. Looking around the table, she saw  one of the seniors with an unpeeled orange on her lunch tray, and  smiled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michiru's sempai Miyuki was just entering the  cafeteria lunch line with her tray, the young gymnast deep in a  discussion with two other juniors. “Really Akiko, I don't understand  you sometimes.”</p>
<p>“What's not to understand?” the other girl asked.  “Class elections are just around the corner after all, and I think I  can do things for this school. There's power involved in being student  body president. The kind of power someone like myself could use to  achieve ends others can't.”</p>
<p>“You're starting to sound like the  villain of a bad shoujo manga,” the third girl said, a curly haired  blonde with glasses. Akiko gave her a dirty look as Miyuki snickered.</p>
<p>“In all seriousness,” Miyuki said once she was done laughing, “We have more pressing issues at hand. Isn't that right Beniko?”</p>
<p>“Right,” the blonde responded, “The play.”</p>
<p>“Have they decided on what it will be yet?” Akiko asked as she pushed her light purple bangs out of her eyes.</p>
<p>“It's  to be 'The Passion of Joan of Arc.'” Beniko answered. “We have 'till  Christmas to come up with a cast and produce the show.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm…”  Miyuki said thoughtfully. “Of course the hardest part is casting the  lead. Joan's supposed to be a young maiden, and…” her voice died off as  the sounds of several hands clapping could be heard accompanying violin  music. The three juniors all exchanged glances as they followed the  music around the corner. There, surrounded by her classmates, Michiru  was playing her violin, bouncing an orange up and down on the edge of  the instrument in rhythm to the tune. As the light from the sun shone  through the large window and illuminated her aqua hair, Akiko smiled.  Turning to Beniko and Miyuki, she crossed her arms triumphantly.</p>
<p>“Girls,” she announced, “I think we just found our Joan.”</p>

<p>The  school library at the St. Agatha Girls' Academy was a large two story  building nestled between the main gym and the greenhouse. The  librarian's office was on the first floor, to the right as students and  teachers came in. Principal Ichi knocked on the office door, the nun  wishing to be shown the spot once more where poor Aya had collapsed.</p>
<p>The office door opened, and a young nun in the robes of a novice answered. &quot;Yes, Ichi-sama?&quot;</p>
<p>Principal Ichi expressed surprise. &quot;You're not Sister Philomena,&quot; she said, &quot;Where's the normal librarian?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's... out,&quot; the young nun answered with a smile. &quot;Perhaps I can help you though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you can. You're new here, I haven't met you before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the novice answered. &quot;I only just arrived a little less than two days ago. My name is Sister Traditor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Traditor?&quot;  Sister Ichi asked. Her Latin was rusty, but something about the  novice's name made her uneasy. &quot;I see. Well, Traditor, since you're  here perhaps you could show me again where young Aya had her attack.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, Reverend Mother,&quot; Sister Traditor said as she exited the office and headed for the stairs, &quot;Follow me.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>&quot;Kaioh Michiru-san?&quot; Beniko asked. &quot;I'll agree she's pretty enough, but isn't she a little, oh I don't know, stuck up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her onee-sama Miyuki doesn't seem to have any problem with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Akiko,  she's only been my kohai for two days,&quot; Miyuki argued, referring to the  term used to describe the younger girls in the school's mentoring  program.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh please,&quot; Akiko said as she waved away the response,  &quot;Have you seen how she acts when you're around? It's obvious the girl  idolizes you.&quot;</p>
<p>While the three juniors continued their  discussion, Michiru smiled proudly as her audience clapped for her. She  was just about to reach the finale, when she became aware of a strange  noise. Her smile disappeared and the orange fell to the ground as she  found herself involuntarily focusing on it. It was a soft noise, and  she felt it more than actually heard it. As the girls around her shook  their heads and made their disappointment known now that the show was  over, she suddenly realized what the sound was.</p>
<p>It was the sound of waves breaking against the shore.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>“This  is the spot,” Sister Traditor said as she led her to a dark corner of  the library’s second floor, surrounded by bookshelves containing  stories of the Saints. “She said she wanted to learn from the Saints’  examples, to be pure and holy. She had a very pure heart.”</p>
<p>“Yes,”  Principal Ichi said with a heavy heart. “She’d once confided in me her  wish to join a convent herself.” Taking up the rosary she and the other  nuns always had hanging at their sides, she made the sign of the cross.  “Come, let us pray for the repose of her soul.”</p>
<p>“Praying for the  dead?” the novice asked with a sneer. “How sweet. To think so highly of  someone who’s already stiff is surely a sign of purity, ne?”</p>
<p>A chill ran down Principal Ichi’s spine as the sense of unease returned. “Sister Traditor, what do you mean by such a remark?”</p>
<p>“I  mean,” she answered as she stalked closer, “ That such a pure heart  might be just what I’ve been looking for.” She then held up her own  rosary. Instead of a crucifix, a black five pointed star hung at the  end of the stringed loop of beads.</p>
<p>Sister Ichi's eyes widened in shock. &quot;Traditor... Of course! Now I remember, 'traditor' is the Latin word for <strong>betrayal</strong>!&quot;</p>
<p>Sister Traditor simply laughed as she pointed the end of her rosary at the principal of St. Agatha's Academy...</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan?&quot; Takayo asked, concerned by the strange look in her roommate's eyes, &quot;Michiru-chan? What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The sea is stormy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Miki asked, the reporter looking just as confused as the others surrounding the violinist.</p>
<p>Michiru  looked down at her violin case containing her henshin wand. She tried  to ignore the sudden surge of adrenaline and the way the hairs were  standing up on the back of her neck. She tried to remind herself of her  earlier resolutions even as her pulse started racing to the point where  it was drumming in her ears in rhythm to the waves crashing in her head  and throughout her being.</p>
<p>She tried, and failed.</p>
<p>&quot;Gomen,&quot;  she said, holding the neck of her violin and the violin bow with one  hand as she grabbed the case with the other hand and ran past her  fellow students for the exit.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; one of the older students smirked, &quot;she didn't have to act like that just because she dropped the orange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know...&quot; Takayo said thoughtfully, &quot;I think that was more than just embarrassment.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Michiru  ran as fast as her legs would take her, across the parking lot and past  the greenhouse until she breathlessly reached the library. As she ran  up the steps, a nun in a novice’s habit burst out through the door.</p>
<p>“Thank  the Lord you’re here!” the nun cried. “Quick, run to the nurse’s office  in the administration building. Principal Ichi has collapsed!”</p>
<p>“No!”  Michiru gasped. “But… But wait, was there anyone else… that is,” the  violinist struggled to catch her breath as she tried to get her  sentence out. “Did you see anything or anyone unusual around her?”</p>
<p>“What?” the novice asked irritably. “This is no time for questions. Go, run!”</p>
<p>Michiru  nodded, but as she ran she resolved to come back and look around  herself later. There was something about the novice that she didn’t  trust.</p>
<p>As the nun watched her run away, she smiled. &quot;Heh, I didn't even need my daemon this time.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>For  a student to suffer a heart attack is considered a fluke and a tragedy.  For both a student and the school principal to seemingly suffer the  same medical emergency within twenty-four hours of each other was  enough to cause a panic. After Principal Ichi was rushed by ambulance  to Tokyo General, the school campus was put on lockdown. Obviously  there was something more than congenitive heart conditions at work.  While a possible gas leak was suspected, none of the administrators or  students were to be allowed to leave their buildings until the mystery  was solved.</p>
<p>Michiru watched the sun slowly set outside the window  of her dorm room. As the campus was slowly cast into shadows, she went  into her closet and pulled out her fall coat. Takayo’s gym class had  been cut short, and she and her fellow students had been ushered out  and back to their dorm rooms before they could shower. As her roommate  continued washing herself, Michiru quickly stashed her wand in her coat  pocket and silently stole out of the room and out the back of the  building.</p>
<p>Trying to stay hidden amongst the shadows, she ducked  behind a rose bush, then dashed for cover behind an oak. As she made a  dash for the cherry tree half a football’s field length away, she was  unaware that a disapproving pair of eyes saw her from within one of the  higher classmen’s dorm rooms.</p>
<p>At last reaching the cherry tree, a surprise was waiting her. “Miki!”</p>
<p>“Michiru?” the school reporter asked, “What are you doing out here?”</p>
<p>“I could ask you the same thing,” Michiru responded as she crossed her arms and stared down at the other girl.</p>
<p>“Well,  I mean, come on; this is the biggest news story ever!” Miki declared.  “And if I can get the inside scoop, my future as a reporter will be  secured. But why are you out?”</p>
<p>“Let’s just say I have my  reasons,” the violinist answered evasively. “Look, if we’re both going  to investigate, we’d best get moving before we’re discovered, ne?”</p>
<p>Miki  nodded, and the two were off once more. A few minutes later, both  freshmen reached the front of the library. As they started slowly up  the stairs to the door, a hand grabbed Michiru by the arm. The girl  quickly turned her head, where yet another surprise greeted her. “O-  Onee-sama!”</p>
<p>“Michiru-chan, what are you doing?” the junior asked.  “I looked outside my window five minutes ago just in time to see you  running around the campus grounds.”</p>
<p>Before she could respond to  defend herself, the library door opened. The sounds of breaking surf  once more rang through Michiru’s body as the same novice she’d seen  earlier looked down at her and her two fellow students. “What is this?”  she asked. “Don’t you know you’re not supposed to be out tonight?”</p>
<p>“G…  Gomen,” Miyuki said as she bowed to the nun, “Michiru-chan was outside,  and I followed. As her sempai, her behavior and conduct are a  reflection on me. Gomen.”</p>
<p>Michiru looked at her sempai, and felt ashamed at having caused her to get in trouble like this. “Onee-sama…”</p>
<p>“Look,” Miki blurted out, “We know there’s something going on here, and we want to know what.”</p>
<p>“Ah,  I see,” the nun smiled. “Three young girls, filled with a pure-hearted  search for the truth. Come,” she said, ushering the three girls in.  “Don’t just stand around, get inside before someone else catches you.”</p>
<p>The  three girls looked at one another and warily went into the building.  “Come in, my little kittens,” the novice said, her voice suddenly  sounding sharper than it had when they were outside. “Just remember  though,” she said as she suddenly locked the library’s double doors,  “Curiosity killed the cat.”</p>
<p>“What?” Michiru asked, the waves within her psyche suddenly swelling up into a typhoon.</p>
<p>The  nun pulled out her rosary and pointed the black star dangling from it  at Miki. The girl screamed as a black beam struck her. As Michiru and  Miyuki watched on in horrified shock, a crystal came out of her chest  and the would-be reporter collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>“Michiru,”  Miyuki ordered, “Run!” the junior then tried to rush the nun, only to  shriek out in pain and fear as the black beam struck her.</p>
<p>Michiru  didn’t wait for her sempai’s crystal to materialize. She knew that if  she was going to be able to do anything she had to put distance between  her and the novice. She ran for the stairs, tripping once on the way  over the carpet and badly scraping her shin. She could hear her  onee-sama’s body fall to the floor behind her as she reached the second  floor and hid between two rows of bookshelves.</p>
<p>“Kitten,” a voice called. “Come on out, kitten. You can’t get away.”</p>
<p>Michiru  didn’t move. Below, Zultan of the Witches Six removed her nun’s habit  and put her hand to her forehead. “Shit,” she grumbled as she pushed a  stray light blue lock of hair behind her ear, “I guess I’m going to  have to release the daemon again after all.” Turning to a janitorial  closet by the library entrance, she unlocked it to reveal a glaring  monster, with dark midnight blue eyes and long red claw-like nails. It  wore what looked almost like a blue nun’s habit, but with a gold upside  down cross on the back of its costume.</p>
<p>“Go,” Zultan ordered as she pointed towards the stairs. “Get the girl.”</p>
<p>“Saintu, Saintu!” the daemon cried, leaping like a frog to the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>From  her hiding place, Michiru could hear the daemon bounding up the stairs  towards the bookshelves. Swallowing hard, she knew it was now or never.  She pulled her henshin wand out and held it over her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Neptune planet power, <strong>make up!</strong>&quot;</p>
