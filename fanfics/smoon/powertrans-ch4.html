<h1>Power Transcendent (part 4 of 31)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessica.html">Jessica</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/powertrans-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Gluon was kneeling on the stone floor of a wide cavern. The floors, 
walls and ceiling of the chamber glowed a very faint white, giving the 
entire chamber a ghostly luminescence. This cavern was thick with 
stalactites and stalagmites, and they did not glow, jutting from the 
floor and ceiling like black fangs in the otherworldly maw of the cave. 
It was an oddly beautiful setting, and it was the nerve center of Lord 
Hadron&#39;s empire here on Earth. 

&quot;You have acted very rashly Gluon.&quot; Meson&#39;s clipped, military voice rang 
out from somewhere in front of him. Gluon kept his eyes fixed on the 
glowing floor and his right arm crossed over his chest. He knew better 
than to move or respond. &quot;The World Anchors are difficult to produce, 
and even harder to transport between worlds. Your foolishness cost us 
one needlessly. And it cost us one of our stronger warriors.&quot; Gluon 
could hear Meson&#39;s steps, winding back and forth between the 
stalagmites. 

Meson&#39;s white clad feet suddenly appeared in Gluon&#39;s line of sight, and 
for the first time he looked up. She was looking down on him, an utterly 
blank expression on her face. &quot;This is the first time you have been 
given so much authority and freedom in your duties. So far, Lord Hadron 
and I are unimpressed.&quot; Her booted foot suddenly lashed out and the 
point caught Gluon right below the chin. The kick threw him onto his 
back, and he felt blood running from the corner of his mouth. 

&quot;You will do better.&quot; Meson said commandingly. &quot;You&#39;re talented Gluon, 
but you&#39;re far from irreplaceable. And those who fail Lord Hadron are 
replaced very quickly.&quot;

Gluon found his voice, and he propped himself up on his elbows, nodding. 
&quot;Yes, Lady Meson.&quot; Meson nodded in return and waited for Gluon to rise 
to his feet. 

&quot;You&#39;ll get another Anchor in four days, Gluon. I strongly advise you to 
treat this one a little better.&quot;

Gluon bowed deeply. &quot;Yes, Lady Meson.&quot; He paused. &quot;My Lady...&quot;

Meson crossed her arms over her chest and cocked an eyebrow. &quot;Gluon?&quot; 
 
&quot;May I speak with Tachyon? I would find it far easier to form a plan if 
I could use her talents to find the best time and place to launch the 
next attack.&quot; Meson&#39;s face hardened and Gluon shut his mouth with a 
snap.

&quot;Two things, Gluon. First, her predictions are far from being a detailed 
map of the future...we&#39;re lucky to get the little information we have. 
Second, her efforts to mask us from detection and her special duties to 
Lord Hadron leave her no time to save you from botching *your* duties. 
You&#39;ll handle this on your own.&quot; She smiled cruelly. &quot;Or you won&#39;t.&quot; As 
an afterthought, she added, &quot;If you really can&#39;t do this on your own, 
I&#39;d suggest asking Muon. He&#39;s there to help.&quot; Her eyes glittered with 
amusement at the rage she saw surging beneath her servant&#39;s calm 
exterior. &quot;Now, go.&quot;

Gluon bowed without a word and stepped back into a portal that opened 
just behind him. When he was gone, a childish giggle echoed through the 
chamber. &quot;He was so upset...&quot; A childish female voice chimed in happily. 
&quot;I sort of felt bad for him. Maybe I *could* give him a little help.&quot; 

Meson looked up. &quot;No, Tachyon. You have to finish the job Lord Hadron 
gave you. You can&#39;t help him.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s too bad. I liked him.&quot; The giggle sounded through the cavern 
again.

------------------

Ami had arrived at the Hikawa Shrine before anyone else, exhausted but 
excited. She spent the time talking to Rei about the miko&#39;s continued 
inability to read their enemies through the fire, but refused to give 
any hints about her own discovery. Rei seemed to have a secret of her 
own and kept giving the most intelligent of the Sailor Senshi a knowing 
smile when she thought Ami wasn&#39;t looking. 

Usagi soon arrived with Mamoru and Chibi-Usa, Luna trailing behind. When 
the attack had occurred yesterday, Mamoru had been on the outskirts of 
Tokyo...far too much distance for even Tuxedo Kamen to cover in such a 
short time. However, he had shown up soon afterwards to make sure 
everything was okay and help Naru and her mother clean up their store. 
The damage was extensive, but so was their insurance policy. 

Setsuna and Hotaru showed up a few minutes later, and Ami hoped that 
Haruka and Michiru would be able to return early as planned. They 
couldn&#39;t afford to be shorthanded for what was coming. Minako, Makoto 
and Artemis came at about the same time, Minako giving Ami a very warm 
smile, which was returned, and Makoto smiling like a cat who&#39;d fallen in 
the cream. Artemis just looked a bit bored and curled up on the steps.

Rei gave Makoto a questioning look, and Makoto grinned and nodded in 
return. Rei blinked, then coughed and cleared her throat. &quot;Ami-chan says 
she&#39;s found something important.&quot; All eyes turned to the Senshi of Water, 
who blushed shyly and smiled.

&quot;That&#39;s right...&quot; She opened her bag and took out her laptop, opening it 
so everyone could see the screen. &quot;I think I know what our enemy is up 
to. And I think I have a plan to stop them.&quot; Everyone murmured surprise 
at that and crowded around the screen on Ami&#39;s lap. She tapped a few 
things into her miniature supercomputer, and a diagram of the pyramid 
the deava had yesterday appeared on both screens. 

&quot;This thing acts kind of like a wedge.&quot; She said. &quot;But it works on space. 
It&#39;s keyed to the coordinates of some other world, and put in the right 
spot, it pushes our world and that world closer together.&quot;

&quot;The right spot?&quot; Minako asked. Ami nodded. 

&quot;A weak spot...&quot; She tapped a few keys and the screen shifted to a map 
of Tokyo. A red marker appeared where Osa-P Jewelry stood. &quot;Kind of like 
a crack in space.&quot; A little pyramid icon replaced the marker, and an 
irregular red mark spread out from it. &quot;If that wedge had been totally 
activated, it would have been much easier in that area to open portals 
between our world, and the world the wedge was keyed to.&quot;

Another pyramid appeared close to the first, and where its red stain 
overlapped the other, little specks of black appeared inside. &quot;With two 
active, portals would begin opening at random, all on their own.&quot; 
Several more appeared at random points around the city. &quot;With six or 
so...&quot; The red blotch covered the Tokyo now, and a huge black stain 
appeared in the center of the city. &quot;When if reaches that point, in that 
black spot our two worlds will be the same place. Moving from world to 
world will be as easy as walking. And there&#39;ll be no way to separate the 
two again.&quot;

&quot;They could move an entire army of daeva into Tokyo!&quot; Makoto exclaimed. 
&quot;But...couldn&#39;t we just destroy the wedges?&quot; She asked. Setsuna was 
already shaking her head however, and Ami nodded to herself at that 
confirmation of what she had surmised. 

&quot;No.&quot; Ami said. &quot;Once they&#39;re active they leave space as we know it, and 
they become pretty much indestructible. The one yesterday was just 
starting to activate when Sailor Saturn destroyed it. A minute or so 
later and not even she would have been able to do that.&quot;

Rei looked curiously at the map. &quot;So what can we do?&quot;

Ami actually smirked at that. &quot;Look...these other spots on the map are 
just random guesses. I don&#39;t know where any of the other dimensional 
faultlines are that they could use...but I can find out.&quot; She tapped 
again, and the projection vanished from the screen. Just the first known 
spot remained. What looked like radar sweeps went out over the map 
periodically, and a complicated series of numbers and symbols appeared 
off to the side. 

&quot;I&#39;m collecting spatial data over the entire city...it&#39;s going to take 
awhile, but I think I can find the most likely spots that they&#39;ll attack. 
Once we have those, we just have to watch and wait.&quot; 

Setsuna smiled. &quot;That&#39;s wonderful Ami-chan. It doesn&#39;t matter if Rei and 
I can see the future if we know where they attack.&quot;

Minako grinned. &quot;And, if they think they&#39;ve cut off all our ways of 
gethering information, they&#39;ll never see us coming!&quot; She smiled proudly 
at Ami and gave her a thumbs-up. &quot;You did great Mercury!&quot; Ami flushed 
and smiled softly. 

&quot;Thanks Minako-chan.&quot; She said. Makoto and Rei shared a knowing grin at 
that. Ami didn&#39;t notice, however, and with the push of a few more 
buttons, the screen went blank. &quot;Well, that&#39;s all I have...anybody 
else?&quot;

Setsuna spoke up. &quot;Devices like these wedges aren&#39;t at all easy to make, 
no matter who you are.&quot; She said in her soft voice. &quot;It&#39;s risky and 
takes time and energy. If we can keep holding them back, they have to 
run out sooner or later.&quot; She allowed herself a small smile. &quot;Probably 
sooner.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good news.&quot; Luna said, stretching. She looked up at Usagi, who 
had been dozing as she leaned against Mamoru&#39;s shoulder. With a long, 
long suffering look she hopped up on Usagi&#39;s shoulder and shouted in her 
ear. &quot;RIGHT, USAGI?&quot; The pigtailed princess jumped and gave a small 
shriek of surprise, then blushed as she noticed everyone looking at her.

&quot;Um...right.&quot; She rubbed the back of her head and grinned. &quot;Sorry I 
dropped out there, but I&#39;m sure everyone did great!&quot;

Mamoru chuckled and helped her to her feet. &quot;I&#39;ll explain it to you 
later, Usako.&quot; 

Ami closed her laptop and put it away. She was eager to get back to work. 
&quot;I guess that&#39;s it.&quot; She heard Makoto say. 

&quot;All right, I should go home and get back to work.&quot; Ami said, standing. 
Minako stood at the same time. 

&quot;Mind if I walk with you part of the way?&quot; Ami felt a warm flush at that. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; She replied, smiling. She headed down the stairs, Minako keeping 
pace. Ami was consistently surprised by the leader of the Inner Senshi&#39;s 
behavior. She had initially assumed that Minako was simply doing her a 
favor by helping her study, but it was becoming increasingly obvious 
that she was just genuinely enjoying Ami&#39;s company. That wasn&#39;t really 
surprising, they *had* always been friends, after all. But they were 
swiftly approaching best friend status. 

Ami had never really had a &#39;best&#39; friend before. Usagi, perhaps. But in 
a way Usagi was everyone&#39;s best friend, so that hardly counted. But 
Minako...she was friendly and open, insightful, artistic and energetic. 
And of course, absolutely beautiful. Just being near her made the blue-
haired Senshi feel warm down to her core. And knowing that they were 
becoming so close was enough to paste a huge, goofy smile on her face. 
When nobody was looking, of course.

&quot;I&#39;m really impressed, Ami-chan.&quot; Minako said. &quot;You really helped us 
out.&quot; That was the leader in Minako talking. Ami had come to recognize 
the tone. 

She smiled in return. &quot;Thanks, but its no big deal...it was really 
obvious once I looked at the data.&quot; 
 
Minako chuckled softly. &quot;Obvious to you might not be so obvious to 
everyone else.&quot; She gently reminded her. She looked over at Ami, tilting 
her head and smiling. &quot;How much extra work is this going to be for you?&quot; 
 
Ami shrugged. &quot;There&#39;s going to be a lot of data to go through...it 
won&#39;t be very hard, just tedious.&quot; She tapped her mouth thoughtfully. 
&quot;I&#39;ll probably have a complete list of likely places by...Saturday?&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;And the next practice exam&#39;s on Friday, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;It is.&quot; Ami nodded in agreement. Minako puffed out her cheeks slightly 
and let out a sigh. 

&quot;I feel bad about having you do so much work, Ami-chan.&quot; She said after 
a moment. 

Ami shrugged noncommittally and smiled a bit. &quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to 
have much free time this week, it&#39;s true.&quot; She smiled shyly, feeling 
herself blush. &quot;But it won&#39;t be so bad...you and I will still be 
studying together.&quot;

Minako smiled back, a small blush on her own cheeks. &quot;Yeah...that&#39;s 
true.&quot; All too soon, they had reached Ami&#39;s apartment building. 
&quot;Well...I guess you can&#39;t do anything today.&quot;

&quot;No...I&#39;d really, really like to...but I can&#39;t.&quot; Ami said, feeling far 
more disappointment than she had anticipated. There was literally 
nothing she&#39;d rather do than drop everything and go have fun with the 
girl standing before her. But, of course, she couldn&#39;t. Minako nodded 
with a sigh. 

&quot;Okay...don&#39;t work yourself *too* hard, okay?&quot; She said seriously, with 
a concerned look that really touched Ami. 

&quot;Okay.&quot; She smiled. She looked surprised for a moment as Minako gave her 
a warm hug, then smiled fondly with a blush and returned it. 

Minako stepped back, grinning. Ami felt her smile widening to a grin as 
well. The two of them stared for a long moment and then started laughing 
softly. &quot;Well,&quot; Ami said, wiping her eyes. &quot;I really need to go.&quot; She 
smiled again at Minako. &quot;Thanks Minako-chan.&quot; 

Minako just smiled back and nodded. &quot;Anytime!&quot; She headed off down the 
street, waving. Ami headed inside. 

As she walked through the lobby, she noticed everyone smiling at her. It 
rather surprised her, until she realized that she had a big, happy smile 
on her own face. And in the elevator, she found herself humming, 
something she very rarely did. Despite her disappointment at not being 
able to spend time with Minako, she felt completely happy. She wasn&#39;t 
precisely sure why, but she did. 

-So who cares why?- She told herself. Seeing the logic of that, she lost 
herself in the happy tune she was humming as she entered her apartment 
and began processing data. 

------------------

&quot;Do you really think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening?&quot; Makoto asked Rei. Usagi, 
Mamoru and all the rest had left in a group shortly after Minako and Ami, 
leaving the two girls behind to talk and compare notes. 

Rei nodded emphatically. &quot;I&#39;m just about positive...whenever you mention 
Minako to Ami, she gets the softest little look in her eyes.&quot; She 
giggled softly. &quot;It&#39;s *really* cute.&quot; 

Makoto nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Yeah...Minako did the same thing. And she 
kept pushing the conversation we were having back to Ami...how smart she 
was, how cute, how sweet...&quot; She grinned. &quot;She&#39;s lucky I&#39;m Ami&#39;s friend 
too, or I would have been really sick of hearing about her.&quot;

Rei crossed her arms and closed her eyes, nodding. &quot;See? It&#39;s just like 
I said...they&#39;re in love.&quot; 

Makoto placed a finger on her cheek thoughtfully and looked up. &quot;I 
wonder why they&#39;re keeping it a secret. They have to know we wouldn&#39;t 
have a problem with it, between Haruka and Michiru, and Hotaru and 
Chibi-Usa.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not so sure they are.&quot; Rei replied. &quot;I mean...I think they&#39;re 
keeping it a secret, but probably from each other, too...honestly, they 
might not even realize how they feel about each other.&quot; 
 
&quot;That might be true...&quot; Makoto replied. &quot;Well...I&#39;d be kind of surprised 
if Minako hadn&#39;t figured it out by now.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;But Ami can be 
*really* clueless about this kind of thing.&quot;

&quot;So what should we do?&quot; Rei asked rhetorically. She was getting a match-
making gleam in her eyes.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Makoto replied, firmly. Rei blinked in surprise and looked up 
at her. &quot;Nothing.&quot; She repeated. &quot;If they&#39;re at that stage, it could be 
really bad if we tried to help them. They might be humiliated...they 
might even get scared away from each other. The best thing to do right 
now is to let them figure this out on their own.&quot; 

Rei sighed deeply. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right...&quot; She looked sidelong over at 
Makoto with a smile. &quot;But if they come to us looking for help...&quot; 

Makoto grinned back. &quot;It&#39;s our duty as friends to help them be as happy 
as they possibly can! So we should make sure that they know that we&#39;re 
available and ready to talk.&quot; 

Both girls nodded at each other seriously, then grinned again.

------------------

Minako stepped into her house and removed her shoes before she heard the 
tell-tale sounds that indicated she wasn&#39;t the only person in it. She 
quickly began slipping her shoes back on, but too late. 

&quot;Mimi, is that you?&quot; She cringed at the pet name and her mother&#39;s 
strident tone. She sighed deeply and rolled her eyes. 

&quot;Yes, Mother, it&#39;s me.&quot; She called back. 

&quot;Where have you been?&quot; 
 
&quot;With my friends at the Hikawa Shrine.&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh, right, your volleyball friends.&quot; Minako gritted her teeth.  

&quot;No mother, my *other* friends.&quot; Minako sometimes wondered how the other 
Senshi were able to keep their identities as Senshi a secret from their 
families. In her case, however, it was rather less of a mystery. Father 
still worked in London, only coming home to Tokyo once a month, if then. 
And Mother...was Mother.

&quot;Well, anyway Mimi...I hate to run out like this, but I have a lunch I 
just can&#39;t miss. And then I&#39;ll probably be out most of the 
night...Kareda-san is throwing a dinner party tonight. Will you be okay 
by yourself?&quot; Minako&#39;s mother, a slightly taller and much skinnier 
version of Minako herself appeared in the hall, heading for the door 
where Minako was still standing. 

&quot;Yes, Mother.&quot; She said shortly. &quot;I always am.&quot;

Her mother paused to give her daughter a quick peck on the cheek before 
hustling out the door. Minako took the one shoe she had managed to get 
on off and sighed, trudging up the stairs. When she was younger, she 
used to wish that her mother would take her with her when she went out. 
Now, she was just glad to get a respite from the flaky, selfish and 
shallow woman. 

When she reached her room, she lay back on her bed and tried to think of 
something pleasant. Of course, her mind immediately turned to one Mizuno 
Ami. Her eyes closed, she pictured the cute genius of the Senshi in her 
mind&#39;s eye. She really was proud of her friend, finally giving them the 
edge they needed to fight back against their new enemy. Of course, if 
anyone could do it, Sailor Mercury could. 

Minako was worried about her, though. She worked so hard...too hard, 
much of the time. She made a mental note to look out for signs that Ami 
wasn&#39;t sleeping, pretty much a sure bet considering all she had to do. 
She smiled a little bit. That was Ami, though. She poured herself, mind 
and heart, into everything she did. Minako doubted Ami even understood 
the concept of not giving a task her all. 

The Senshi of Love rolled over onto her side and rested her head in the 
crook of her arm. She yawned softly. Images of Ami still swirling about 
her head, she drifted off into a light sleep. 

------------------

Hours later, as the sky was growing dark, Artemis padded into Minako&#39;s 
room to find the blonde girl snoring softly into her mattress, fully 
dressed. The white cat chuckled and shook his head fondly, then hopped 
up onto the bed and placed his forepaws on the side of Minako&#39;s head, 
pushing down slightly. &quot;Minako...&quot; He said softly. 

Other than a muffled grunt, there was no change. He began to bounce up 
and down a little harder. &quot;Minako!&quot; Still nothing. With a cat&#39;s grin, he 
extended his claws. &quot;Minako!&quot;

Minako snorted loudly and sat upright, tossing Artemis across the room. 
&quot;What? Who is it? Where?&quot; She asked blearily, looking around the room.  
 
Her cat guardian shook himself out of his daze and scrambled to his feet. 
&quot;Well, it&#39;s about time!&quot; He said. &quot;How long have you been asleep?&quot;

Minako yawned a bit and took a brush from the nightstand, straightening 
her hair. &quot;What time is it now?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s almost seven.&quot; Minako blinked in surprise, then continued her 
brushing. 

&quot;That late? Wow...I&#39;ve been asleep all day!&quot;

&quot;Well, you didn&#39;t really get a lot of rest after the fight 
yesterday...you were tossing and turning all night.&quot; Artemis replied. 
&quot;You&#39;d think you could have a little consideration for your poor 
suffering guardian!&quot; He sniffed piteously and then yowled and ducked as 
a pillow sailed his way.  
 
&quot;Oh, hush cat.&quot; Minako said, making a face at him. She was smiling 
gently and humming to herself. Artemis looked at her in surprise. 

&quot;Are you okay? You&#39;re never this happy when you wake up.&quot; 

Minako tilted her head. &quot;Hm...I think I had a really nice dream.&quot; 

&quot;Oh? What about?&quot; 
 
Minako smiled. &quot;You know, I can&#39;t remember at all. It really put me in a 
good mood, though.&quot; She yawned and stretched, sliding off the bed. &quot;Come 
on cat, let&#39;s have a little dinner.&quot;

Despite her socialite mother, the Aino family had never been in much of 
a position to employ servants. There was a housekeeper that came in once 
a week, a very nice woman named Keiko that Minako liked very much, but 
most of the day to day stuff was left to the family. Which, of course, 
meant Minako. 

Ever since she&#39;d outgrown her nanny at the age of ten, Minako had been 
cooking for herself. She didn&#39;t have the knack for it like Makoto did, 
but she could keep herself from starving to death. She entered her wide 
kitchen and checked the fridge. Some takoyaki and a few dumplings that 
she could fry up stood out. &quot;That&#39;ll do.&quot; She hummed. 

She also got out a can of tuna and opened it onto a plate on the kitchen 
table for Artemis. Of course, by the time her own meal was ready and she 
sat down to join him, the greedy cat had licked the plate clean. 

Silence reigned for a few minutes as Minako began eating. She paused for 
a moment to listen to the sounds of her house. She remembered being a 
girl of only eleven and hiding in her room when it was windy and the 
house began to creak in a frightening way for a little girl. She&#39;d been 
too scared even to come down and eat. Minako honestly didn&#39;t like her 
home very much...she&#39;d been abandoned there far too often. It wasn&#39;t 
huge, but it would always feel big and very empty to her. She&#39;d been 
very disappointed when they moved back in on her return to Tokyo.

She sighed a bit. Artemis, familiar with this line of thought, sat next 
to her arm and lightly nuzzled her hand. She smiled down at the cat. 
&quot;Artemis...&quot; She said, trying to think of something less gloomy. &quot;What 
do you think of Ami?&quot;

Artemis made a thoughtful humming sound and licked a paw to bathe his 
face. &quot;I think she&#39;s great...or at least she&#39;d better be, with the way 
you&#39;ve been ditching me for her this week!&quot; Minako poked his head 
lightly and he grinned.  
 
&quot;Artemis, I was being serious!&quot; 
 
&quot;Okay, okay...&quot; He continued to wash his face as he thought. &quot;I think a 
lot of the time she doesn&#39;t let herself feel.&quot;

Minako leaned forward, nibbling on a dumpling. &quot;Explain.&quot;

Artemis yawned and stretched in that particular catlike manner before 
sitting down again, resting his head on folded paws. &quot;I think she tends 
to just push herself through whatever she has around, concentrating so 
much on her task that she never has time to really get in touch with her 
feelings.&quot; He closed his eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve really noticed this last week, with 
the two of you spending so much time together. She throws herself into 
her studies or whatever to the point that she can&#39;t possibly pay 
attention to anything else.&quot; 

&quot;But that&#39;s a good quality!&quot; Minako protested, feeling rather defensive. 
&quot;She works really, really hard.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t a good quality.&quot; Artemis said. &quot;I think she 
takes it to extremes, though. She uses work as a way to escape from 
having to really deal with her problems. I doubt she even really notices 
herself doing it at this point.&quot;

Minako thought about that for a moment. &quot;So you noticed her doing this 
while the two of us were studying?&quot;  
 
Artemis nodded into his paws. &quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;I wonder what she was trying not to think about...&quot; Minako mused 
quietly. Artemis just shrugged a bit. 

&quot;Who knows? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really dangerous...yet. Luna and I worry 
about her sometimes, though.&quot; 
 
&quot;So do I.&quot; Minako murmured. 

&quot;I think getting close might be good for both of you.&quot; The white cat 
said softly. 

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Minako asked peevishly. 

&quot;You both keep too much bottled in, Minako.&quot; Artemis looked up at as she 
began to speak. &quot;Don&#39;t try to deny it...I know you better than just 
about anyone. I know how much you keep your real feelings to yourself.&quot; 
He settled his head down once again. &quot;It would be good for you both to 
have someone you can confide in.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve always confided in you, Artemis.&quot;  
 
Artemis chuckled a little. &quot;Yeah...but maybe you&#39;d feel a little closer 
to someone your own gender and species.&quot; 
 
Minako smiled and chuckled as well. &quot;Yeah...maybe so.&quot; She pushed her 
chair out and headed upstairs. Artemis followed behind her after a 
moment. She had homework due tomorrow...she hoped she could handle it. 

Well...she smiled to herself. If she couldn&#39;t, she was positive Ami 
wouldn&#39;t mind it if she gave her a little call for some help.
