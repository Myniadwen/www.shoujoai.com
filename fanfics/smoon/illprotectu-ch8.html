<h1>I'll Protect You (part 8 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;Rui-saaaaaaaan! There you are! I was so worried---&quot; Rinka said as she 
ran across the road towards them. She paused and gasped when she saw Rei

&quot;Rei-sama! When did you get in here?&quot; Rinka asked, now staring at Minako 
as she hugs Rei

&quot;Just a few minutes ago. And you, where were you when Ai&#151;er, 
you-know-who is here?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;I&#151;uh...watched the TV over that store?&quot; Rinka said guiltily, Rei was 
surprisingly calm and didn&#39;t get mad at her

&quot;I&#39;ll deal with you later okay? First we should get her back to the 
hotel or else she&#39;ll catch a cold&quot; Rei said

&quot;I don&#39;t want to go back&quot; Minako suddenly said on Rei&#39;s shoulder

&quot;B-but Rui-san your rehearsal isn&#39;t finished yet&quot; Whispered Rinka

&quot;Rui-san?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;Uh, I&#39;ll explain later. We have to get her back there...&quot; Rinka replied

&quot;Get her back when she&#39;s soaking wet? Come on let&#39;s take her to the 
hotel first to change her clothes&quot; Rei said

&quot;I said I don&#39;t want to go back!&quot; Minako pouted, as if like a child that 
doesn&#39;t want to leave her mother

Rinka sighed

&quot;Rei-sama, the hotel is way too far from here and she will sure catch a 
cold...I know! Your apartment is walking distance from here right?&quot; 
Rinka merrily said as her hair began to cover her face because of the 
rain

&quot;Er...We can&#39;t let her walk that far...get a taxi, we are lacking of 
time anyway&quot; Rei commanded Rinka

The young agent eagerly walks on the edge of the road to wait for a taxi 
to come

&quot;...hey, are you feeling well?&quot; Rei asked Minako, but the pop star 
didn&#39;t respond so Rei decided to go on

&quot;I didn&#39;t realize you were this iron headed. I didn&#39;t think it would 
come into this, I&#39;m sorry I broke my promise&quot;

No response from Minako. Rei is starting to feel guilty; she took 
Minako&#39;s cap off, covers the blond girl&#39;s head with both of her hands to 
protect her from the rain and then kissed the pop star&#39;s forehead

As Minako felt Rei&#39;s lips touch her forehead she raised her head to face 
Rei, eyes wide open. Her sunglasses (shades) were left to fall 
unnoticed. Good thing the people around them didn&#39;t recognize Minako, 
they were busy finding shelter from the unexpected rain

&quot;Feel better?&quot; Rei asked, blushing a bit

Rinka suddenly cut in

&quot;Rei-samaaa! The taxi&#39;s here!&quot;

Rei nodded to the younger agent then turned her head to Minako

&quot;You&#39;ll catch cold if we stay here longer, let&#39;s go to my apartment, 
I&#39;ll lend you some clothes so that we can get back to the studio and 
continue your rehearsal&quot; Said Rei as she places the shades back to 
Minako&#39;s eyes

&quot;I don&#39;t want to, I&#39;m not moving here if you still wanted to get me back 
there&quot; Pouted Minako as she tightens her hug

Rei couldn&#39;t waste time any longer

&quot;H-Hey! Rei-chan what are you doing?&quot; Minako squeaked as Rei lifted her 
up and carried her to the taxi. As Rinka saw them she immediately opened 
the door of the taxi to assist the two

&quot;I said I don&#39;t want to get back!&quot;

&quot;Rui-san, we have to, or else we take full responsibility if something 
happens to you&quot; Rinka pleaded

Minako went silent. Rei sat beside the driver&#39;s seat, Rinka sat beside 
Minako at the back seat

They went silent in the taxi for about three minutes until they reach 
Rei&#39;s apartment building. They made their way inside Rei&#39;s apartment

&quot;Rei-sama, can I use your phone? I&#39;ll call my boyfriend Tomoichi to drop 
by and pick me up, I forgot to submit my reports to the headquarters&quot; 
Rinka said

&quot;Go on, use it&quot; Said Rei as she chooses some comfortable clothes for 
both Minako and Rinka

Minako is now wrapped in a towel, sitting. She wasn&#39;t wearing any shades 
or retainers anymore but her hair is still in braids. She&#39;s looking 
around Rei&#39;s apartment silently as Rei pulls down the curtains of her 
apartment window and then went back to picking up clothes

&#39;The room smells just like her, a scent of fresh roses. Nice set of 
stereo, a large fluffy bed...and no Television?&#39;

Minako groaned, maybe she&#39;s too busy to watch TV...

&quot;Here, Rinka wear these&quot; Said Rei as she hands Rinka some clothes

&quot;Thanks, Rei-sama! But I&#39;ll just take a bath at our house; my boyfriend 
will be here any second now&quot; Said the young agent as she placed the 
speaker phone back

Rei nodded, an then she turned to Minako

&quot;Aino-san, please take a bath and change your clothes. You can use my 
bathroom&quot; Said Rei

Minako is still silent. Few minutes later a knock came from Rei&#39;s door 
sounded. Rei opened it slightly to avoid exposing her room and Minako

&quot;Tomo-chan, Rinka&#39;s been waiting for you&quot; Said Rei

&quot;Good afternoon, Rei-san...Rinka said you both got wet from the rain, 
it&#39;s really surprising it rained today&quot; Said Tomoichi who is carrying a 
rather large umbrella. Then Rinka appeared in Rei&#39;s back

&quot;Let&#39;s go Tomo, bye Rei-sama! Take care of Rui-san for me!&quot; Rinka said 
as she pulls her boyfriend excitedly towards the elevator of the floor 
apartment

Rei sighed and closed the door of her apartment. She once again turned 
to Minako, the pop star is still silent. Then she picked up the clothes 
that Rinka was supposed to wear

&quot;Aino-san&#151;&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re telling me to get a bath then don&#39;t&quot; Minako cut in

Rei was about to give Minako her clothes to wear

&quot;How did you recognize it was me?&quot; Minako suddenly asked

&quot;Because that is my job,&quot; Rei simply said then she continued

&quot;Your concert rehearsal is still ongoing right? And maybe Wendy-san has 
other schedules for you this evening&quot;

Minako took her cell phone from her pocket, incredibly, it was still 
turned on despite of the truth that her clothes are wet. She shot Rei a 
look, then dialed a number

&quot;Hello Wends? It&#39;s me...I know I&#39;m late, tell them I&#39;m not feeling well 
and I went back to the hotel...I&#39;m alright, honest, I&#39;m in Rei&#39;s 
apartment and she&#39;s here. Agent Rinka will escort you back to the 
hotel...Yes, yes I know! Just...Please Wendy...Thank you&quot;

Then Minako turned her cell phone off and looked back at Rei who is 
speechless

&quot;You&#39;ll have to call Rinka and tell her to drop by in the studio and 
pick up Wendy back to the hotel&quot; She said coldly

Rei couldn&#39;t take what Minako is doing anymore

&quot;What-is-wrong-with-you?&quot; Rei asked Minako

&quot;I was supposed to be the one asking you that, Rei!&quot; Yelled Minako, her 
eyes started to get watery with anger

&quot;You are Minako Aino, a famous pop star. Why do you want to pull 
yourself down?&quot;

&quot;Rei, why are you so numb? I just said I love you and you ignored me, I 
came for you and now you are pushing me away&quot; Cried Minako

&quot;I just don&#39;t want to be the reason why Minako Aino didn&#39;t attend her 
rehearsal and other important meetings today&quot; Rei said

&quot;That&#39;s the problem, you always act professional! Can&#39;t you be just Rei 
Hino and not agent Hino?&quot;

&quot;What is the difference? Minako we&#39;ve just met two days and eleven hours 
ago. How sure are you that you are really in love me?&quot; Rei replied, a 
little heat on her tone

&quot;Rei, I&#39;ll give up everything for you; I can feel from the bottom of my 
heart that you are my soul mate. Can&#39;t you feel the difference between a 
happy person and a happier person?&quot; Minako said

&quot;Can you say that you are contented with this life Rei?&quot;

Rei shrugged. A happier person?

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter when or how long we have met each other. If you feel 
that I am the right person then you should feel the same way that I do. 
Do you feel what I feel Rei?&quot; Minako hopefully asked

Rei was silent. &#39;What do I feel? I feel like...&#39;

&quot;...I feel the same. I felt like I&#39;ve met you before but I didn&#39;t. I 
feel stupid because I have feelings for you, a pop star,&quot; Rei looked at 
the pop star and then she looked away

&quot;You are so perfect, and look at me! I&#39;m a police trying hard to be 
strong and trying hard to hide the fact that I am but a raven with 
broken wings!&quot; Rei finally burst out, tears starting to fall from her 
eyes

Minako calmed and she wiped the tears from Rei&#39;s cheeks

&quot;It&#39;s good to hear you shout for the first time Rei-chan&quot; She smiled

Rei shook her head

&quot;Wendy told me this life is all you ever dreamed of. You have worked so 
hard, I know. I don&#39;t want you to give up everything you&#39;ve started from 
scratch, I want you to be happy&#151;&quot;

Rei stopped as she mentions the word Happy. Then Minako gently smiled at 
her

&quot;See? Now do you realize the difference between them?&quot; Minako said

Rei didn&#39;t know what to say

&quot;I am really happy that I came this far. But I can&#39;t be a pop star for 
the rest of my life, which is my dream. Now that it finally came true, 
it is time for one of my goals to be done. And finding someone to be 
with and who will equally love me for what I really am for the rest of 
my life is one of it. And if I found that someone, I can finally say 
that I am happier than what I am before&quot; Minako explained

&quot;Are you sure you wanted me to be happy only?&quot; She asked

&quot;...Of course I want you to be happier&quot; Rei weakly replied

&quot;And I also want you to be happier&quot; Minako said as she approaches Rei, 
she leaned her hands to her bodyguard&#39;s chest and kissed her lips as 
gently as she could as long as she can control her hunger for those lips

Rei couldn&#39;t control her emotions anymore; Minako&#39;s lips were like 
caffeine that warms up her veins which had been so cold long time ago. 
Even if there is her uncle Namada Hino who always love her as a 
daughter, it is always different if someone else beside from a family is 
giving true love and affection to you

She became Rei Hino for the first time

&#39;Her lips were really softer than I thought&#39; Rei said to herself

&quot;Think of me as your wings now Rei-chan. What do you feel this time?&quot; 
Minako asked

Rei closed her eyes to think. Then she kissed Minako back, which 
surprised Minako a bit

&quot;Did you feel that?&quot; Rei asked

Minako wanted to shout at the top of her lungs, Rei had finally accepted 
her feelings for the pop star

&quot;I felt like flying&quot; Minako dreamily said

Rei grinned

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I had doubted you. I always think too much and never even 
realizing that--&quot;

&quot;Hush. No more doubts and self blaming&quot; Minako cut Rei as she now 
launched her passionate kiss on Rei&#39;s lips, her bodyguard rewarded it 
with the same passionate one

As their lips parted breathlessly

&quot;I want to say this to you face to face this time...I love you Rei-chan&quot; 
Minako said as she looks on Rei&#39;s darkening cerulean eyes

&quot;...I love you too. Thank you for rescuing my soul, Mina-chan&quot; Rei 
mumbled under Minako&#39;s nose

&quot;What? I didn&#39;t hear that&quot; Minako smirked

&quot;I said I love you Mina-chan&quot; Rei said

&quot;I still can&#39;t hear it&quot;

&quot;I love you Mina-chan!&quot;

&quot;I want it louder!&quot;

Rei smirked then kissed Minako

&quot;Okay, loud enough&quot; Minako said contentedly

-----

Yay! Finished another chapter! Whew, I have to wait until I could log in 
to upload this, nyahahahaha!

My daydreaming is really effective these past few days, so I was able to 
update again. I&#39;m sorry if this chapter got a bit exaggerated or 
something... I was hungry when I was writing this one heheh...

I just want to share you where I mostly got my inspiration for this fic, 
I read a SM fic at A good observer commented that Cerulean is blue, 
which I have described Re&#39;is eyes in this fic. I forgot to explain that 
to you guys...argh...

In that fic, Raye&#39;s (Rei) eyes were described as cerulean and not 
amethyst or lavender. I was a little confused that time, but we all know 
that Raye&#39;s eyes are lavender or amethyst. But the story was too 
creative and cute to argue with Raye&#39;s eye color, so I left it ignored. 
Then I read it once again and thought: Rei with Cerulean eyes, why not?

Well anyways, thanks for reading this boring explanation!

I&#39;ll keep updating as usual. Did you want the little &quot;argue&quot; thing 
between the two? You&#39;re right; I felt that way too...
