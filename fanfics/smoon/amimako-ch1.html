<h1>The Ami-Makoto Affair</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/billk.html">Bill K.</a><br> </h2>
<pre>As always, for those only familiar with the English dub:
Usagi=Serena; 
Ami=Amy; 
Rei=Raye; 
Makoto=Lyta; 
Minako=Mina
Haruka=Amara; 
Michiru=Michelle;
Trista=Setsuna;
Mamoru=Darien;
Rini=Chibi-Usa

Finally, Haruka and Michiru are NOT cousins.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have heard so many people postulate that Ami and Makoto are sweet on 
each other, it inspired this story as a response - Bill K.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Can we get started?&quot; groused Rei.

Rei, Minako and Usagi sat around a round table, school books out. The 
door to Rei&#39;s bedroom, which looked out onto the temple garden, was 
open to allow the summer air to waft in. Usagi was doodling cute bunny 
pictures on the margins of her notebook. Minako was playing with the 
straw from her now empty cup of soda. Artemis and Luna were off in a 
corner discussing something - - it could have been Sailor business or 
it could have been the relative merits of salmon versus tuna.

&quot;That kind of seems pointless,&quot; Minako said absently, her concentration 
focused on the straw, &quot;since Ami&#39;s not here. Who do you think was going 
to tutor us - - you?&quot;

&quot;Hey, I got an &#39;83&#39; on my last history exam,&quot; rumbled Rei, stung by the 
perceived put-down. &quot;What did you get?&quot;

Minako glared at the raven-tressed fire priestess.

&quot;A forty-two is respectable,&quot; Minako frowned.

&quot;Only if it&#39;s your age,&quot; Rei fired back. The two glared at each other 
for a few moments. Then they realized Usagi hadn&#39;t said anything. 
Mouths curling in anticipation, they both turned to her. It took Usagi 
several more moments to realize that the conversation had stopped. She 
looked up and saw her friends staring at her, the question of the 
moment unspoken but evident in their eyes.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it,&quot; she grumbled and returned to her 
doodling.

&quot;Even so, I&#39;d still rather wait for Ami,&quot; Minako added.

&quot;I wonder where she and Makoto are?&quot; Rei wondered. &quot;Do you suppose 
there&#39;s trouble?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Usagi said in a sing-song manner as she doodled.

&quot;She&#39;s using that voice again,&quot; sighed Minako.

&quot;What voice?&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;Your &#39;I know something you don&#39;t know&#39; voice,&quot; Rei replied. &quot;You 
always use it when you&#39;ve got a juicy piece of gossip you&#39;re dying to 
tell someone, but are holding it in because you don&#39;t want to look like 
some ancient, meddling busybody.&quot;

&quot;OK, I won&#39;t tell you,&quot; shrugged Usagi.

&quot;Fine, I don&#39;t want to know,&quot; replied Rei.

A second of silence passed.

&quot;Ami and Makoto are in love,&quot; Usagi said.

&quot;With who?&quot; gasped Rei.

&quot;With each other, dummy!&quot; sputtered Usagi.

That bit of news even floored the cats.

&quot;Where did you hear this?&quot; demanded Luna, after she regained her 
composure.

&quot;I have my sources,&quot; Usagi smiled, infinitely pleased with herself.

&quot;Which means she heard it fifth hand in either the cafeteria or the 
girl&#39;s locker room,&quot; scowled Rei. Usagi made an angry face at her.

&quot;I heard it,&quot; she proclaimed defensively, &quot;from Sanjuro Watanabe!&quot; Then 
she stuck her tongue out at Rei.

&quot;Sanjuro?&quot; Minako said, lips thinning. &quot;Usagi, how many times do I have 
to tell you that I am the only credible source of gossip in that 
school?&quot; Artemis tried unsuccessfully to stifle a laugh in the 
background.

&quot;Well, it makes sense,&quot; Usagi replied. &quot;Don&#39;t you remember the dance? 
Ami and Makoto danced with each other because neither one of them had 
dates there?&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean anything,&quot; Rei replied, not sounding quite convinced.

&quot;Oh, but what if it did?&quot; sighed Usagi, her chin propped up in her hands 
with her elbows on the table. &quot;Ami&#39;s so scared of guys and Mako-
chan has such bad luck with them; they must be really lonely. Why, a 
young girl needs love in her diet to grow strong and healthy, just like 
she needs food. Being dateless isn&#39;t a good situation to be in.&quot;

&quot;Tell us about it,&quot; Rei and Minako sighed in unison.

&quot;Fortunately, I have. . .&quot; Usagi began to crow.

&quot;Mamo-chan, we know,&quot; Rei and Minako sighed again in unison.

&quot;And if they decided they love each other,&quot; Usagi continued, undaunted, 
&quot;there&#39;s nothing wrong with it. Just look at Haruka and Michiru. And 
they&#39;re so right for each other - - Ami&#39;s gentle and loving, and 
Makoto&#39;s strong when she has to be and tender all the other times. And 
if they fill each other&#39;s needs. . .?&quot;

&quot;What about sex?&quot; Minako wondered openly. Usagi&#39;s face when a deep 
crimson, while Rei gaped at the blonde like she&#39;d just swallowed a Buick. 
&quot;Oh come on! Tell me you both haven&#39;t wondered how Haruka and Michiru do 
it? You know the old saying: &#39;You can&#39;t teach an old dog how to sit up 
and beg for it&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Artemis, I don&#39;t EVEN know what that meant,&quot; Luna said.

&quot;Neither do I, and I live with her,&quot; the white cat muttered in reply.

&quot;But as it happens, I happen to know how lesbians have sex,&quot; Minako said 
proudly.

&quot;First hand experience?&quot; Rei asked pointedly. Usagi giggled.

&quot;Noooo,&quot; Minako replied with strained patience. &quot;I have been around, 
unlike you two. Let me enlighten you, children. At this very moment, 
Ami and Makoto could very well be. . .&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------

Rrrrip! Ami&#39;s blouse loudly shredded under the unyielding force of 
Makoto&#39;s grip. The girl&#39;s arms flew up to her chest, hoping to conceal 
her conservative white bra and the delicate flesh held by it. Her skirt 
was already lying on the floor, leaving only snow white panties between 
her legs.

Makoto&#39;s hands locked around her wrists and Ami found them inexorably 
forced apart. She looked up, to appeal to the mercy of the taller girl, 
and found a look of pure animal lust painted on her face.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; whimpered Ami. &quot;Stop, please!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Makoto leered. &quot;Just as beautiful as I imagined.&quot;

The taller girl released Ami&#39;s left wrist and moved her hand up to the 
girl&#39;s shoulder. She brushed the bra strap down over Ami&#39;s shoulder 
until gravity took over. Ami struggled to pull free, but Makoto was too 
strong for her. Another brush of her hand brushed the cup down, freeing 
Ami&#39;s left breast. It was wine glass small, rounded and topped with a 
rosebud of a nipple floating in alabaster skin. Ami&#39;s hand went up to 
cover herself.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid,&quot; Makoto said, gently but with a firmness that hinted 
she would not tolerate being denied. She brushed Ami&#39;s hand away and 
captured the breast. &quot;You want it. You want it just as much as I do.&quot;

&quot;Mmmmmmm,&quot; whimpered Ami as Makoto&#39;s thumb caressed across the top of 
the nipple. &quot;Please don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;You probably want it more,&quot; Makoto smiled, licking her lips. &quot;I&#39;ve 
seen the way you sneak glances at me. How you check me out when you 
think nobody&#39;s looking.&quot;

Ami&#39;s lip quivered as her eyes fluttered closed.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to hide your feelings,&quot; Makoto said, continuing to 
stroke the nipple with her thumb. Her left hand released Ami&#39;s wrist 
and slid up her arm. She reached the shoulder and caressed the other 
bra strap down.

&quot;We shouldn&#39;t,&quot; groaned Ami.

Suddenly Makoto shoved. Ami pitched backwards and fell onto a sofa. As 
she lay sprawled, Makoto reached down and seized her bra between the 
cups. A vicious jerk and it was gone. Ami squealed in alarm, but her 
cry was answered by Makoto&#39;s hand ripping her panties off as well. She 
tried to scramble to her feet, but Makoto shoved her back down. Ami 
looked up at the brown haired girl towering over her.

&quot;I&#39;m tired of playing, Ami,&quot; Makoto rumbled, her hands pulling off her 
own blouse. Underneath, Makoto wore nothing and her large breasts, one 
larger than both of Ami&#39;s combined, quivered from the movement. The 
coral nipples were hard and prominent, the aureoles wide. &quot;I&#39;m tired of 
denying what I feel for you. I want you, Ami,&quot; and she jerked down her 
skirt and panties to reveal a ten-inch cock between her legs, &quot;and I&#39;m 
going to make you want me!&quot;

Ami gasped in shock.

-----------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Whoa! Time out! Hold it!&quot; interrupted Rei. &quot;Makoto doesn&#39;t have 
a-a-a . . . you know what between her you know where!&quot; Usagi was 
staring at Minako, frozen in utter disbelief as Rei sputtered.

&quot;Of course not,&quot; scowled Minako, speaking as one would to a child. 
&quot;It&#39;s a double dildo, of course! The one end is stuck up. . .&quot;

&quot;Where did you learn about something like that?!!&quot; gasped Artemis.

&quot;I told you,&quot; sniffed Minako, in haughty grandeur, &quot;I&#39;ve been around.&quot; 
At this point, everyone noticed that Usagi was still staring, stunned, 
at Minako. &quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;ve blown the poor child&#39;s mind,&quot; gaped Rei.

&quot;THEY MAKE THINGS LIKE THAT?!&quot; Usagi burst out.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Minako replied. &quot;Lesbians have to compensate somehow for not 
having the right equipment.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s. . .that&#39;s. . .&quot;

&quot;Usagi,&quot; Luna said sternly. &quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking. Stop this 
instant.&quot;

Usagi scowled.

&quot;Now,&quot; Minako said, &quot;if I may continue. . .&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------

Makoto had her pinned to the sofa. Her huge bosom pressed to Ami&#39;s face 
from either side, filling her nostrils with the woman&#39;s scent. Her 
weight pinned Ami down as her hands pressed Ami&#39;s wrists to the 
cushion. The girl forced her hips between Ami&#39;s legs and she could feel 
the head of the dildo press at her entrance. 

&quot;Don&#39;t fight me, Ami,&quot; Makoto whispered, her voice sodden with lust. &quot;I 
can make this sweet for both of us.&quot;

The shaft pressed into her. She felt it fill her up, felt her lips 
stretching to encompass it. Then it struck an obstruction. Makoto 
forced her way forward with a thrust of her hips.

&quot;Aaaaahhhhh!&quot; Ami cried out.

&quot;A virgin?&quot; Makoto whispered. She leaned down and kissed Ami on the 
forehead. &quot;You really don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve been missing. Let me show 
you.&quot;

Makoto began thrusting in and out of Ami. The motion caused her body to 
rub against Ami&#39;s. The poor girl didn&#39;t know what to think. What she 
was doing was wrong, and yet Makoto was so soft. She was as large, as 
strong, as overwhelming as any man Ami had dreamed of, and yet she was 
so soft, too. The way the satiny skin of her upper torso rubbed against 
Ami&#39;s pebble hard nipples did something to her. The way Makoto 
dominated her secretly thrilled some deep, buried passion, some race 
memory Ami didn&#39;t know she had. And the way she angled the dildo as she 
thrust so that it occasionally grazed her sensitive clitoris, and the 
way Makoto&#39;s pubic hair tickled it when the dildo didn&#39;t set a fire to 
building within her.

&quot;Oh,&quot; groaned Makoto, the double dildo doing its work on her, too. &quot;Oh, 
Ami! I. . .oh. . .ah!&quot;

&quot;Deeper,&quot; pleaded Ami breathlessly. &quot;Harder. . .I want to feel it. . . 
feel it in my. . .my chest!&quot;

The passion within her built steadily. It was like a spring winding 
tighter and tighter, pulling in more and more of her rational thought. 
She was like a cauldron of seething emotions, swirling and bubbling 
with every thrust from Makoto. She wanted to clutch the girl, to grab 
her and hug her tightly, but she was prevented from doing even that and 
the frustration only added to her tightening spring.

&quot;Oh!&quot; she gasped. &quot;Going to explode!&quot; 

Makoto was grunting like an animal, trusting harder and faster. The 
perspiration on her body mingled with Ami&#39;s and stained the cushion 
below them. A single thrust and the spring broke.

&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; screeched Ami as a new, yet familiar sensation flooded 
over her body.

Dimly she felt Makoto&#39;s hands squeeze her wrists more tightly and heard 
a strangled cry from her. Her breaths came in tight, quick, frightened 
little gasps, so intense had the moment been. Makoto&#39;s thrusting slowed 
to a stop. She released Ami&#39;s wrists and the girl wrapped her arms 
around Makoto&#39;s torso.

&quot;I&#39;ll be anything you want me to be,&quot; Ami whispered. &quot;Do anything you 
want me to do. Just. . .never leave me.&quot;

&quot;The only thing I want you to do,&quot; Makoto whispered in reply, &quot;is to 
never stop loving me.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Girl, you&#39;ve been reading too many doujins,&quot; Rei said, shaking her 
head.

&quot;I&#39;m telling you, they&#39;re probably licking the sweat off of each 
other&#39;s naked bodies at this very minute,&quot; Minako protested.

&quot;Utter rubbish!&quot; scowled Luna.

&quot;Do they really make that double-whatsis thingy?&quot; asked Usagi.

&quot;Usagi!&quot; warned Luna.

&quot;Hey, just consider the source,&quot; Artemis frowned disdainfully.

&quot;You want to sleep in the alley tonight, cat?&quot; Minako glared.

&quot;Seriously, Minako, it sounds like some sweaty twenty yen sex fantasy 
that they sell on the Ginza,&quot; complained Rei. &quot;Remember, this is Ami 
and Makoto we&#39;re talking about.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and I suppose you can come up with a better scenario?&quot; Minako 
sniffed, the challenge obvious in her voice. Rei pondered the idea for 
a few moments.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she smiled. &quot;How&#39;s this sound?&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------

Ami pressed the buzzer on the door to Makoto&#39;s apartment. She was 
curious as to why her friend had asked her over. The phone message was 
confusing. The tone of it seemed to imply something urgent and possibly 
unfortunate, yet Makoto&#39;s tone seemed hopeful.

She hoped it wasn&#39;t anything bad. She liked Makoto, admired her. 
Makoto seemed to be everything she wasn&#39;t. The girl was physically 
robust and imposing where Ami was petite and mousy. Psychologically she 
was out-going and aggressive, taking chances and letting defeats roll 
off of her back. Ami was so painfully shy and conservative, afraid of 
taking chances lest she be stymied and lingering for long periods on 
her defeats.

&quot;Hi, Ami,&quot; Makoto said, opening the door and ushering the girl in. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad you could come over. I didn&#39;t know who else to turn to about 
this.&quot;

&quot;It sounds serious,&quot; Ami said. Makoto motioned her down and went into 
the kitchen. While she was gone, Ami looked the apartment over. It was 
so beautifully decorated and immaculately kept up. Makoto had such a 
domestic talent. Even though her own penthouse apartment, where she 
lived with her mother, was far more expensively furnished, Ami felt 
more at home here than there. When she got her own place, Ami made a 
promise to herself to ask Makoto to help decorate it.

&quot;Well, maybe I&#39;m just worrying over nothing,&quot; Makoto said, bringing in 
a tray of tea. She poured a cup for Ami and presented it to her, then 
poured one for herself. Ami sipped the tea. It was delicious, of 
course. &quot;I&#39;m, well, how do I say this?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m worried I may have a lump in my breast.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear!&quot; gasped Ami. &quot;Have you given yourself an examination?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just it,&quot; Makoto said sheepishly. &quot;I don&#39;t know how.&quot;

&quot;Then why do you think you have a lump?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; she shrugged. &quot;I just kind of sense something. It&#39;s too 
weird to explain. But it&#39;s something I need to know, so. . .I was kind 
of hoping you&#39;d do it for me.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; gasped Ami, her face flushing a bright crimson.

&quot;Well, you&#39;re the doctor&#39;s kid. I figured you&#39;d know how to do it.&quot;

&quot;I-I do, b-but,&quot; sputtered Ami. &quot;Mako-chan, you really should go to a 
doctor.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to go if it&#39;s nothing. Besides, you&#39;re my friend. I don&#39;t 
mind taking my top off in front of you. Why should you mind?&quot;

Ami glanced at the floor. She could feel her cheeks burning.

&quot;Well,&quot; she swallowed, &quot;I suppose if I&#39;m going to be a doctor, I&#39;m 
going to-to have to learn to touch another person&#39;s, well, private 
parts.&quot; She took a huge breath to steady herself. &quot;All right. If you 
don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Makoto said. She was wearing a short-sleeve denim shirt. It 
and her white bra, underwire Ami noticed, were off in seconds.

&quot;Oh!&quot; gasped Ami, looking at Makoto&#39;s breasts. They were so large and 
round; prominent was a good description of them. They sagged slightly 
from their own weight, but they were proportional to her large torso 
and were just one more imposing thing about the imposing girl.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Makoto asked curiously.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Ami swallowed again, her cheeks burning again. &quot;Oh, nothing. I&#39;m, 
um. . .shall we begin?&quot;

Ami sat next to Makoto. She placed her right hand on the girl&#39;s back, 
square upon the shoulder blade. The skin was soft, but the muscles 
beneath the skin suggested power Ami could never hope to summon. Her 
left hand lightly pressed to the left breast, below and to the right of 
the nipple. She felt Makoto tense and a hiss of air passed up through 
the girl&#39;s nose.

&quot;This may tickle a little,&quot; Ami warned her gently.

She moved her hand slowly in a circular motion, putting just enough 
pressure onto the skin to feel for abnormalities. Makoto&#39;s skin was 
silky smooth and Ami&#39;s scientific detachment was struggling with the 
tensile stimulation she was receiving. Makoto felt so soft and warm and 
her own loneliness had inspired many nights worth of dreams about some 
strong, yet soft lover carrying her to a paradise of erotic fulfillment. 
A low moan from Makoto brought her out of her reverie.

&quot;Am I hurting you?&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;Nooo,&quot; sighed Makoto in a tone clearly indicating she was enjoying the 
examination.

Perhaps enjoying it too much. Ami snatched her hand away. Instantly, 
Makoto leaned forward and pressed her lips to Ami&#39;s. The girl was so 
startled that she didn&#39;t move. After a few seconds, though, she 
regained her wits and broke off contact.

&quot;That was fun!&quot; grinned Makoto, placing a hand on Ami&#39;s breast through 
her blouse. &quot;Let me examine yours now!&quot;

&quot;MAKOTO!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Makoto said wistfully, sagging back. &quot;It was all a story 
to get you here. I&#39;ve been crazy about you for a while now. So crazy it 
drove me to try a stunt worthy of Minako. I-I just thought it would 
break the ice. I&#39;m sorry if I imposed.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re attracted,&quot; Ami asked incredulously, &quot;to me?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Makoto replied earnestly. &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful, and you&#39;re so 
smart, and you&#39;re so kind. You&#39;re everything I&#39;ve ever wanted in a 
lover. I&#39;ve just been looking for it in guys. Then I wised up and 
realized you were right next to me all the time. And I thought, the way 
you&#39;re always looking at me and the way you almost swallowed your 
tongue when you saw my breasts, I thought. . . I thought maybe you like 
me, too.&quot;

&quot;So there&#39;s no lump?&quot;

&quot;Just the one in my throat,&quot; Makoto said, looking down. As usual, 
Makoto had laid herself bare emotionally. A single word could crush 
her, tear her heart into tiny ribbons. It was a word Ami knew she 
couldn&#39;t utter, not only because she was far too kind to do such a 
thing, but also because the thought of Makoto&#39;s arms crushing her to 
the woman&#39;s breast and never letting go was suddenly the most 
overwhelming thought in her mind.

&quot;Maybe I should check it,&quot; Ami whispered.

Tentatively she moved her face toward Makoto. Makoto held perfectly 
still. Ami&#39;s lips pressed to Makoto&#39;s throat and began kissing and 
nibbling the skin. She heard Makoto suck in air. Then she felt Makoto&#39;s 
arms fold around her. That spurred her to begin licking.

&quot;F-Find anything, Doc?&quot; Makoto murmured.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami breathed, her hot breath glancing off of Makoto&#39;s throat and 
back at her. &quot;It&#39;s very hot in here. Could you take my blouse off?&quot;

Makoto felt blindly down Ami&#39;s torso until she found the buttons to her 
blouse, a sensation that Ami didn&#39;t regret in the least. Once it and 
her bra were gone, Ami sat up again. The two topless girls sat for a 
few moments drinking in the sight of each other.

&quot;Let me check the right one now,&quot; Ami said, eyes locked with Makoto&#39;s. 
Her hand reached over and lightly cupped the large globe. Her thumb 
came up, brushed over the top of the nipple, then traced lightly around 
the aureole.

&quot;Mmmmmmmmm!&quot; sighed Makoto. Her eyes closed and her head lolled back.

&quot;It feels very healthy,&quot; Ami replied, a smile curled around her lips. 
She leaned in and pressed her lips to the nipple. Her teeth parted and 
her tongue began playing with it. She felt Makoto stiffen again, the 
girl&#39;s breath shuddering out. As she licked, Makoto&#39;s hand began 
stroking her hair. It made her scalp tingle and she increased the 
intensity of her licking.

&quot;Ami,&quot; heaved Makoto. &quot;I want to make love to you.&quot;

The thought appealed to Ami and the two girls wiggled out of their 
skirts and panties. Makoto&#39;s physical presence pushed Ami onto the 
couch on her back, with Makoto looming over her.

&quot;I&#39;ve never done this before,&quot; Ami admitted, embarrassed. &quot;How do two 
girls make love?&quot;

Makoto smiled, gently amused. &quot;Well, where do you touch yourself when 
you&#39;re playing with yourself?&quot; Ami flushed and her gaze fell, but she 
pointed to a spot between her legs. Makoto&#39;s tapered finger appeared 
next to it. &quot;It&#39;s the same thing, only someone else is doing the 
touching.&quot;

Makoto&#39;s left arm cradled Ami from behind while her right hand touched 
Ami&#39;s sweet spot. Instantly Ami&#39;s eyes clamped shut as an undeniable 
tingling seizure gripped her entire body. Makoto&#39;s hand caressed the 
spot, tender and gentle as only another woman would know to do. The 
sensation made Ami want to curl up into a fetal ball, to smother the 
sensation with her body so it couldn&#39;t escape. She had to do something 
with her hands, so they blindly sought out Makoto. Finding her arm, 
Ami&#39;s hand slid down until it found her breast and she began caressing 
back.

&quot;Do you want one inside?&quot; asked Makoto, her mouth so close Ami could 
feel her breath brush her cheek. 

&quot;Um hmm,&quot; Ami nodded helplessly.

A single finger slid inside of her and Ami&#39;s passions racheted up 
another level. She was panting now and little high-pitched squeaks were 
coming from her mouth.

&quot;You&#39;re so wet,&quot; Makoto whispered. &quot;You&#39;re almost as wet as I am.&quot;

And just like that Ami had to know. Her hand skittered down Makoto&#39;s 
lanky frame until it brushed pubic hair. Probing blindly until she 
found the labia, Ami slid a finger inside. Makoto gasped 
affectionately.

&quot;Oh, Ami,&quot; she sighed and pressed her mouth to Ami&#39;s. The pair remained 
that way, kissing until they had to breath, then gasping in air and 
resuming the kiss. Ami was the first to groan an orgasm into Makoto&#39;s 
mouth, but she kept her mouth to her lover&#39;s until Makoto could do the 
same. Panting as if they&#39;d just run twenty miles, the girls broke and 
looked at each other.

&quot;I&#39;m not tired,&quot; grinned Makoto. &quot;How about you?&quot;

&quot;I think I could do this for twenty years,&quot; giggled Ami.

So they went back at it.

-----------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Boring!&quot; bellowed Minako.

&quot;That&#39;s not the way Mako-chan would do it,&quot; nodded Usagi.

&quot;How would you know?&quot; Rei snapped. &quot;Has she ever tried to seduce you?&quot;

&quot;I. . .ah. . .er. . .NO!&quot; sputtered Usagi.

&quot;It&#39;s so sappy,&quot; scowled Minako.

&quot;It&#39;s warm and tender and beautiful!&quot; fumed Rei.

&quot;It is,&quot; nodded Usagi. &quot;It&#39;s warm and tender and beautiful. I was very 
moved by it. It&#39;s just not the way it would happen.&quot;

&quot;Oh, listen to the expert,&quot; huffed Rei.

&quot;Do I have to tell you how it would happen?&quot; Usagi said in wonderment.

&quot;NO!&quot; Minako and Rei said in unison.

&quot;Well,&quot; Usagi continued, ignoring them, &quot;Ami and Makoto would have this 
cute little cottage on the outskirts of town. Ami-chan would be just 
coming home from her job being a big-shot doctor at this really 
prestigous hospital she runs, where all the doctors are really cute and 
hunky and. . .&quot;

&quot;Get on with it!&quot; roared Luna.

-----------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Mako-chan!&quot; Ami called out, closing the door to the cottage behind her. 
&quot;I&#39;m home!&quot; 

&quot;Darling!&quot; Makoto said, coming out into the hall. She was wearing a 
green dress with short sleeves and a mid-thigh skirt, and a starched 
white apron was tied around her waist. Her brown hair was done up in 
its familiar pony tail, and pearls dangled from her ears and around her 
waist. Beige hose and brown pumps completed the ensemble. She scampered 
up to the door, ladle still in her hand and melted into Ami&#39;s arms.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve missed you so,&quot; Ami said, squeezing the larger girl tightly, 
burying her face into Makoto&#39;s bosom. Ami wore a navy business jacket 
and matching tight knee-length skirt, a white open collar blouse, black 
hose and high heels. Her glasses were perched on her nose. When she 
pulled back from Makoto&#39;s bosom, the lenses were fogged up. Ami 
released a hand from around Makoto&#39;s waist, pulled the glasses off and 
slid them into her jacket. 

&quot;I hope you&#39;re hungry, Ami-chan,&quot; Makoto beamed. &quot;I&#39;ve been preparing 
dinner all afternoon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m hungry, all right,&quot; Ami leered. &quot;Hungry enough to eat you right 
here and now.&quot;

Makoto gasped in shock, partially because Ami&#39;s hand was squeezing her 
bottom. The shock melted into joy and she and Ami engaged in a long, 
slow, lingering kiss, oblivious at that moment to everything else in 
the world. When they finally parted, stars were in their eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ve,&quot; panted Makoto. &quot;I&#39;d better get dinner.&quot; She bit her lip in 
frustration, then pulled away. A smack of Ami&#39;s hand on her ass sped 
her on her way.

The pair dined by candlelight, still a favorite pastime of theirs even 
after so long in their relationship. Ami eagerly tasted the food and as 
always pronounced it superb. Makoto&#39;s breast swelled with pride. 
Throughout the meal, they would chew absently as their eyes saw nothing 
but each other. After the meal was over, Makoto cleared the dishes away 
and began washing them. Within moments Ami was behind her, reaching 
around and gripping her wrists as she washed, while nuzzling the girl&#39;s 
 shoulder blade with her cheek.

&quot;Mmmmm,&quot; groaned Makoto, barely concentrating on what she was doing, 
&quot;You&#39;re not helping.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps this will help,&quot; Ami smiled.

Her hands slithered away from Makoto&#39;s wrists and settled on her 
breasts. Makoto loudly sucked in air as Ami began kneading them through 
the fabric of the girl&#39;s dress. It shuddered out in a paroxysm of 
barely contained lust. Makoto began grinding her ass against Ami&#39;s 
waist.

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; she extracted with effort, &quot;get the dishes done this way.&quot;

&quot;I think they can wait,&quot; Ami whispered, planting a soft kiss on her 
shoulder.

&quot;I think you&#39;re right.&quot;

Makoto turned in Ami&#39;s grip, gathered her up in her arms with her hands 
tucked under Ami&#39;s ass, and sought out her mouth. As they kissed, Ami&#39;s 
right leg came up against Makoto&#39;s hip, her skirt riding up to reveal 
the garters beneath. Makoto could feel the wet spot in Ami&#39;s panties as 
she ground them into Makoto&#39;s hip. It matched her own.

When their lips finally parted, Makoto stared down at her love. Then 
she bent down and scooped Ami up in her arms. The girl let out a squeal 
of surprise, then wrapped her arms around Makoto&#39;s neck and melted to 
her. Makoto carried her into the bedroom and set her down.

Once on her feet, Ami took control again. She reached around Makoto 
from the front to undo the clasps to her dress that were in back of 
her. As she did, their breasts touched and a shiver passed through them 
both. Makoto stood hypnotized as Ami undid the dress, drew it forward 
and down until it fell to the floor. She minced around behind Makoto as 
the girl remained still. Ami traced the line of her lover&#39;s spine with 
her finger playfully, then undid the bra and slid it down her arms. She 
undid the garters, but left the hose on Makoto&#39;s legs, then slid the 
white panties down the girl&#39;s long legs.

Freed from the spell, Makoto turned around. She knelt at Ami&#39;s feet, 
reached up and pulled the blazer from her shoulders. One by one the 
buttons of Ami&#39;s blouse came open, Makoto looking at her the entire 
time. Ami reached out and twirled the loose strand of brown hair that 
dangled over Makoto&#39;s ear. When the blouse pulled open, Makoto leaned 
in and kissed Ami&#39;s belly, then pulled the blouse away. Being tall had 
its advantages, as in this case: Makoto was able to reach around and 
unhook Ami&#39;s bra while still on her knees. The bra fell away and 
Makoto&#39;s fingers playfully grazed Ami&#39;s nipples for just an instant. 
She grinned at the hiss of air that came from her lover.

The skirt came away in moments, revealing sexy garters no one would 
guess the prim Ami Mizuno possessed. They disappeared as well, though 
the black stockings remained, and were soon followed by her panties. 
Ami felt the circulating air of the room tickle her.

Still kneeling, Makoto placed a hand on each of Ami&#39;s hips to brace her, 
then leaned in and began lapping at the girl&#39;s groin. Almost 
immediately Ami&#39;s face twisted in pleasure. Her breath shuddered out 
and she placed her hands on Makoto&#39;s shoulders for added support. Soon 
her body was twisting and squirming to the rhythm of Makoto&#39;s tongue, a 
tongue she needed to escape, even if she didn&#39;t want to, but couldn&#39;t.

&quot;Ohh!&quot; she groaned. &quot;That feels so good! Faster!&quot;

Makoto licked until an orgasm washed over Ami. Her knees turned to 
water and she slumped, caught by her lover. All she could do for 
moments after was pant and, when she found the strength, kiss her 
lover&#39;s neck and shoulder.

&quot;Oh, you are such a naughty girl,&quot; Ami wheezed finally. 

&quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot; leered Makoto.

Her answer was Ami suddenly shoving Makoto on the floor onto her back. 
She quickly straddled the girl, sitting on her chest and bending 
forward. With her arms wrapped around Makoto&#39;s thighs, she shoved her 
tongue to the girl&#39;s vulva and started probing. Makoto instantly 
started squirming beneath her. But Ami continued relentlessly, pushing 
her tongue between the lips, taunting the clitoris with the tip and 
then moving on to other areas. Makoto groaned. She moaned. She cursed. 
She sounded like a wounded animal in its death throes. She pleaded with 
Ami to stop, begged her, threatened her. Finally she stiffened and 
shrieked out the joy Ami had been searching for a sign of, her fingers 
digging into Ami&#39;s hips.

Satisfied, Ami climbed off Makoto. Regaining her feet, she extended a 
hand and pulled her lover up. Like magnets, they sought out the comfort 
of each other&#39;s arms.

&quot;So why&#39;d we come into the bedroom if we weren&#39;t going to use the bed?&quot; 
Makoto asked as she crushed Ami to her.

&quot;We still have the rest of the night,&quot; whispered Ami.

Makoto smiled. &quot;You always were smarter than I was.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------

&quot;That was a lovely story, Usagi,&quot; Makoto said, entering the room. &quot;Who 
were you talking about?&quot;

The cheeks of everybody in the room flushed red, their eyes seeking the 
floor.

&quot;Um, uh, well, no one, um, no one you&#39;d know,&quot; Usagi babbled.

&quot;The three of them have been sitting here gossiping about you and Ami 
and your supposed romance,&quot; Luna told her.

&quot;LUNA!!!&quot; bellowed Usagi. Luna responded with a very malicious toothy 
smile.

&quot;Our romance?&quot; gasped Ami, entering behind Makoto.

&quot;What made you three think we were having a romance?&quot; Makoto fumed.

&quot;She started it!&quot; Rei scowled, pointing at Usagi.

&quot;And you two quickly tried to dissuade her, correct?&quot; Ami asked, looking 
directly at Rei and Minako with an angrily arched eyebrow.

&quot;I. . .well,&quot; Rei stammered. &quot;She started it!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you three would even consider such a stupid notion!&quot; 
Makoto grumbled. 

&quot;Well,&quot; whined Usagi, &quot;Sanjuro sounded so convincing.&quot;

&quot;Sanjuro, huh?&quot; Makoto nodded. &quot;That explains that. I beat Sanjuro at 
pick up basketball last month. I guess the little rodent just couldn&#39;t 
get over it. But that doesn&#39;t excuse you, Usagi! I&#39;m not like that! And 
I&#39;m really hurt that you&#39;d make up stuff that said I was!&quot;

Instantly Usagi was bowing at Makoto&#39;s feet. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m 
sorry!&quot; she wailed. &quot;Please forgive me! I&#39;ll do anything!&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah? How about you do my homework for the next month?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do anything else!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you might want to reconsider that, Makoto,&quot; Rei jabbed. &quot;After 
all, you do want to pass, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP, REI!&quot; Usagi bellowed and stuck out her tongue.

&quot;IT&#39;S NOT MY FAULT YOU&#39;RE AN IDIOT!&quot; Rei bellowed back and stuck out her 
tongue.

&quot;Before you two get into another tongue war,&quot; Ami said firmly, &quot;I think 
the three of you owe us an apology.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, Ami,&quot; Usagi said, bowing penitently. &quot;We just got to 
talking and didn&#39;t know when to stop. I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

&quot;Rei?&quot; Makoto said.

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Rei said. &quot;We let our mouths get ahead of our brains. 
I&#39;m sorry if we hurt you both.&quot;

&quot;Minako?&quot; Ami said.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Minako shrugged, &quot;I think you both make a cute couple.&quot;

&quot;MINAKO!!!&quot; everyone roared.

&quot;All right, all right! I&#39;m,&quot; she stopped, extracting the words with 
some difficulty, &quot;sorry.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s still Usagi&#39;s fault,&quot; Rei huffed.

&quot;REI HINO, YOU ARE THE MEANEST PERSON IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!!!&quot; 
bellowed Usagi. 

In an instant Rei and Usagi were nose to nose, each one trying to give 
the other one a longer raspberry. Minako was rolling on the floor with 
laughter, while the cats tried to find a place to hide until it blew 
over. Ami and Makoto looked at each other and sighed in resignation.

Then they both noticed that the other one really was kind of attractive.
