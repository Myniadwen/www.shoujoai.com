<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 12 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>        Sailor Neptune leapt gracefully, the green haired beauty in a 
sailor fuku dropping down smoothly beside her partner. &quot;Do you think we 
should call Ami and the others?&quot; she asked, taking up a fighting stance.

        &quot;We can handle a few Youma,&quot; Sailor Uranus said with a confident 
smile. &quot;Besides,&quot; the sandy haired young woman said as the creatures 
shambled towards them slowly, &quot;I&#39;d really hate to have to interrupt 
their date.&quot;

        &quot;Neptune Deep Submerge!&quot; Neptune cried out, flinging her attack 
into another Youma and watching with satisfaction as it was destroyed. 
&quot;I guess so,&quot; she agreed with a smile, &quot;it certainly took the two of 
them long enough.&quot;

        &quot;Now we just have to get the two of them to go out on their 
own,&quot; Uranus said. &quot;Uranus World Shaking!&quot; another enemy went up in a 
burst of power.

        &quot;Ahh-choo!&quot; Ami sneezed, blinking.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Setsuna asked curiously, looking across the 
table at Ami. Cleared plates littered the table, everyone having vaguely 
satisfied looks on their faces.

        Ami shrugged, &quot;I don&#39;t know where that came from.&quot;

        &quot;Then maybe someone&#39;s talking about you,&quot; Chibi-Usa said, 
finishing off a second bowl full of some rich treat.

        Hotaru chuckled softly at that, working on finishing off her own 
treat. All around them the club was busy as ever, young women talking 
together, swaying together out on the dance floor or sitting at tables 
like theirs. Ami took a drink, setting the cup down with a happy sigh.

        Setsuna had some sake, her eyes resting on Ami thoughtfully. Ami 
looked up at her with a slight blush, &quot;Did I....&quot;

        &quot;No, just thinking,&quot; Setsuna said. She tilted her head to the 
side, &quot;When I first met you during the Dark Moon affair, I never 
expected that we&#39;d be where we are now.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Ami admitted. She looked into the crowd with the 
oddest look on her face as she dropped her voice to a whisper, &quot;When I 
met Rei earlier, she thought I was her lover... then went to another 
version of me and....&quot;

        Setsuna put her hand on Ami&#39;s, squeezing gently. &quot;It&#39;s a bit 
unnerving,&quot; she agreed. She looked at Ami worriedly, &quot;Did that bother 
you?&quot;

        Ami shook her head no. &quot;I just wonder what I didn&#39;t see back 
then,&quot; she admitted, &quot;with my face buried in a book.&quot;

        &quot;It wasn&#39;t quite that bad,&quot; Setsuna reminded her.

        &quot;Well, maybe,&quot; Ami admitted. Her cheeks colored a bit, &quot;I liked 
Makoto, maybe a bit more than was friendly, but Rei? That surprised me.&quot; 
She chuckled, thinking of Sailor Venus as she added, &quot;But love does 
that, I think.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re a wise young woman,&quot; Setsuna murmured.

        &quot;Could we try that?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked, looking over at the 
dancing couples.

        Ami hesitated then noticed Setsuna giving her a little smile. 
&quot;Why not,&quot; she agreed, rising from her seat and offering Setsuna her 
hand. &quot;Would you care to dance?&quot; she asked formally.

        &quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Setsuna nodded with a smile.

        Hotaru echoed Ami&#39;s movements and the four of them moved out 
onto the dance floor together. The two smaller girls seemed to find the 
rhythm easily, swaying together with obvious enjoyment, but their elders 
had a bit more difficulty.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Ami murmured, barely avoiding stepping on Setsuna&#39;s 
feet.

        Setsuna chuckled softly, meeting Ami&#39;s eyes with gentle 
amusement. &quot;There&#39;s no final exam on this,&quot; she murmured, &quot;you don&#39;t 
have to try so hard.&quot;

        Ami puffed out a breath, &quot;Easy for you to say.&quot; Still, she found 
that by not concentrating so much on where her feet were going the 
dancing got easier, oddly.

        &quot;We really should leave them alone,&quot; the quiet voice said, 
eerily familiar.

        &quot;Oh come on, you know you&#39;re curious about her,&quot; the other 
answered cheerfully. Ami felt a hand rest on her shoulder and turned to 
see the smiling face of Minako Aino. The blonde beamed, &quot;Wow, you really 
do look cool with the scar.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Rei Hino apologized, the black haired woman looking 
oddly uncomfortable.

        Makoto Kino stood behind her, brown hair flowing over her 
shoulders with two other older woman Ami didn&#39;t immediately recognize. 
Her own twin gazed at her wide eyed, dressed in much more feminine 
clothes than her own suit.

        &quot;Everyone,&quot; Ami murmured, blinking away her sudden tears, hoping 
and praying that she could maintain her composure. Joy and despair 
surged within her heart, staggering her with the intensity of the 
emotions.

        &quot;Well Usagi&#39;s not here,&quot; Makoto noted, her green eyes narrowed a 
bit in concern as she looked at Ami, &quot;she&#39;s out with Mamoru.&quot;

        &quot;How did that happen?&quot; Minako asked, looking at Ami&#39;s scar with 
fascination.

        &quot;You know that she can&#39;t answer that question,&quot; Setsuna said, 
putting a protective arm around Ami&#39;s shoulders.

        &quot;I think,&quot; the red headed woman whom a dazed Ami recognized as 
Mrs. Haruna, Usagi&#39;s old teacher, &quot;that they were having a night out 
together. Maybe we should leave them alone?&quot;

        &quot;But...&quot; Minako protested, &quot;I want to know what our versions are 
like on her world! Maybe we&#39;re all tough and butch.&quot;

        &quot;Come on love,&quot; Natsuna said, the police officer tugging Minako 
away.

        Only the other Ami lingered a moment. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ami said, and 
something in her eyes showed she understood Ami&#39;s feelings of grief and 
shock. &quot;If I had known, I wouldn&#39;t have let them come over,&quot; and with 
that she left to rejoin Rei.

        &quot;So those were the Inner Senshi,&quot; Hotaru murmured, appearing at 
their side with Chibi-Usa, &quot;I wish I could have known them better.&quot;

        &quot;Are you going to be all right?&quot; Setsuna asked Ami softly.

        &quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; Ami forced a smile as she continued, &quot;could 
we get going? I think I&#39;ve had enough for one night.&quot;

        &quot;Sure, Ami-papa,&quot; Chibi-Usa slipped her hand comfortingly into 
Ami&#39;s. The three of them left the way they came, paying the bill before 
slipping outside.

        &quot;I&#39;m going to have a little talk with my counterpart,&quot; Setsuna 
sounded truly angry, &quot;she should have known to keep them away from us.&quot;

        &quot;Couldn&#39;t she argue you should have kept me away from them?&quot; Ami 
asked as they walked over to the car together.

        &quot;A point,&quot; Setsuna conceded that as she opened up the back seat 
for Chibi-Usa and Hotaru to climb inside.

        Ami opened up Setsuna&#39;s door for her before going around to the 
driver&#39;s side. She sat down, laying her hands on the wheel before taking 
a steadying breath. &quot;It&#39;s odd,&quot; she murmured so that only Setsuna heard, 
&quot;part of me is glad to see them, but the other part...&quot;

        &quot;One of the few things I hate about being the Senshi of Time,&quot; 
Setsuna answered equally quietly, &quot;is knowing about all the alternate 
possibilities.&quot;

        Ami started up the car, &quot;How do you cope?&quot;

        &quot;I try not to think about it,&quot; was the dry answer.

        The car pulled out into traffic, moving back towards the city 
center at a brisk pace. &quot;Could you put the radio on?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked.

        Setsuna and Ami both reached for it, hands tangling a moment as 
Ami blushed slightly. The radio came on and a smooth pop song was 
playing, one about searching for lost love. It inspired a strange 
feeling in Ami, one she had difficulty pinning down.

        &quot;That&#39;s Three Lights,&quot; Hotaru offered, &quot;they&#39;re very popular at 
our school.&quot;

        &quot;Three Lights?&quot; Ami murmured, frowning thoughtfully.

To be continued....

Author&#39;s Notes: the Senshi that Ami meets are from the stories Ice on 
Fire and Love and Lightning as well as appearing in the regular 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket continuity. The scene was inspired by some comments 
from readers as well as what I thought Minako might do....</pre>
