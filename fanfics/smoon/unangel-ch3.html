fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/unangel-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Beautiful. Observe. Her eyes, such a pure blue. Hmm, every movement she 
makes is at once graceful and awkward...innocence and experience, all 
rolled into one perfect being. My hero...
 
&quot;What are you staring at Mitsuki?&quot;

Oh no...caught.
 
&quot;Um...I was observing the err...building.&quot;

Brilliant. 
 
Minako eyed Mitsuki quizzically. &quot;Well, ok...are you alright? You seemed 
sort of frazzled.
 
Oh, now you have her worried, you twit. Keep your eyes on the scenery 
and not on the beautiful deity next to you. Oh, now she&#146;s staring at you 
with those big blue eyes...pull your gaze away before you get lost.
 
Mitsuki jerked her head away from Minako, her face turning a bright 
shade of pink. What were these odd feelings?
 
&quot;I...there&#146;s nothing wrong at all.&quot;
 
And now she&#146;ll ask again. Such is the concern of one adorned with the 
beauty of a god.
 
&quot;Are you sure sweetie? If you&#146;re nervous, we can come back another day. 
I&#146;m sure Miss Meiou wouldn&#146;t mind.&quot;
 
See what I said? Oh...was that a term of endearment she used? Perhaps 
you&#146;re just imagining it. Maybe, you can say you&#146;re feeling ill, and get 
out of this meeting with the fashion designer. Then of course, the 
goddess will find it necessary to spend an entire day with you...but that 
would be cowardly and deceitful of you. Stop gawking  at her like an 
idiot and tell her you&#146;re fine.   
 
&quot;No, no! I&#146;m alright go&#151;I mean Minako-comforter! Yes, yes, I&#146;m fine...we 
should go right now, I&#146;m sure Miss Meiou is waiting, and we&#146;ve stood out 
here so long...&quot;
 
Damn your morals. Walk.
 
Mitsuki walked over to the building briskly, leaving Minako standing 
there in confusion.

&quot;What a weird kid...&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
&quot;Go go Kazuki!&quot; said Hotaru. She was sitting a safe distance away from 
Kazuki and Ririko, near a weeping willow in the gardens. She was sure 
her father wouldn&#146;t mind Kazuki and Ririko training in the gardens, but 
just to be sure, she had instructed that they stay a good distance away 
from any flora.

Ririko rolled her eyes. &quot;You know, I do wish I had a cheerleader like 
you, Kage,&quot; she muttered, twirling her katana around in her hands.
 
Kazuki glared at her. &quot;Shut up and fight. And she isn&#146;t my cheerleader. 
She&#146;s just sure of who the victor will be.&quot;
 
One of Professor Tomoe&#146;s assistants, Ami Mizuno sat near Hotaru, tapping 
furiously at a laptop. Hotaru spared a glance at the blue-haired genius, 
and then turned back to the &quot;battle.&quot; Ami never really had much to say, 
and she kept to herself most of the time. Occasionally she would smile 
at Hotaru, or give her a polite hello, but that was about it. Hotaru 
didn&#146;t mind though. Her papa had told her that Ami was just very serious 
when it came to her work.
 
Ami turned to Hotaru and gave her a soft smile. &quot;Why hello, Miss Tomoe. 
How are you today?&quot;
 
Hotaru beamed at Ami. She was the only one that spoke to her as if she 
was a young lady, and not the child everyone thought she was. 
 
&quot;I&#146;m fine Ami. I&#146;m just watching Kazuki-san and Ririko-san train. Kazuki 
is very good,&quot; she added.
 
Ami chuckled, turning to the fight as well. &quot;She seems to be more 
focused than Ririko, but she&#146;s a bit arrogant. I believe it hampers her 
judgment. What do you think?&quot;
 
Hotaru watched and then winced as Kazuki kicked Ririko into a rather 
large oak tree. &quot;I think Kazuki is the best,&quot; she said simply.
 
Ami chuckled. &quot;You...admire her a lot, don&#146;t you?&quot;
 
Hotaru flushed a deep red. &quot;I guess I do...&quot;
 
Ami smiled again, and turned back to the fight.
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Setsuna Meiou&#146;s head bobbed slightly to some unknown tune in her head as 
she listened to one of the possible new models rattle off why she 
thought she was best to model for the spring designs. Her assistant, and 
model herself, Michiru Kaioh bit down a soft, demure giggle as the young 
woman proudly proclaimed why she would be the best for the job.
 
&quot;Miss Meiou, I know I&#146;ll be perfect for your designs. I have the body 
for it, and people always like &quot;take-charge,&quot; attitudes, and I&#146;m 
definitely take-charge. I work out all the time, and of course, I&#146;m very 
attractive, don&#146;t you think?
 
Setsuna lowered her rimless sunglasses, turned to Michiru, who gave her 
a soft smile and rolled her eyes, and then back to the girl.
 
&quot;Actually, I think you&#146;re a bit chubby. Right around her thighs there,&quot; 
she motioned with a wave of her hand, &quot;see Michiru?&quot;
 
Michiru, for her credit, remained completely straight-faced as she 
nodded in agreement.
 
Setsuna nodded as well, a rare smile gracing her lips as she continued 
to chip away at the girl&#146;s ego.
 
No more nice Setsuna. I&#146;m so tired of this vapid, shallow little fools 
right out of high school thinking they can take advantage of an 
opportunity like this.
 
&quot;And another thing. Keep your asinine little remarks to yourself. To 
continually say that you are beautiful proves your lack of self-esteem 
and tact. Neither I nor Michiru care to hear about how wonderful you 
think you are.
 
&quot;And before you leave, I&#146;d like to tell you that you aren&#146;t new or fresh 
to me; I&#146;ve seen a million women like you, and with far better attitudes 
than you. Learn some humility dear. The exit is to your left.&quot;
 
The girl left, practically in tears, and Michiru gave her employer a 
surprised look.
 
&quot;Bad day, Setsie?&quot;
 
The other woman lifted her sunglasses back up, and chuckled a little.
 
&quot;On the contrary, it&#146;s been wonderful.&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Minako blanched as a girl tore out of Setsuna Meiou&#146;s office, crying her 
eyes out.
 
&quot;Wow...poor girl.&quot;
 
She turned to Mitsuki.
 
&quot;But don&#146;t worry! That won&#146;t happen to you,&quot; she cried, grabbing 
Mitsuki&#146;s hand and tugging her toward the room.
 
She peeked her head into the office, smiling weakly.
 
&quot;Hi, my name is Aino Minako, and I have a friend with me. We&#146;re here to 
see you, Miss Meiou. I mean, if that&#146;s alright with you.&quot;
 
Michiru smiled a little, and Setsuna shrugged.
 
&quot;It&#146;s all right by me.&quot;
 
Minako walked in, practically dragging Mitsuki behind her. Setsuna 
raised an eyebrow.
 
&quot;Is that her? The girl Kunzite was going on about?&quot;
 
Minako nodded her head. &quot;Yes, she is.&quot;
 
Setsuna smiled a little. &quot;She doesn&#146;t talk much, does she?&quot; Minako 
shrugged helplessly, turning to the still-silent Mitsuki.
 
Setsuna smiled, and turned to Mitsuki.
 
&quot;Well, tell us something about yourself.&quot;

EMERGENCY0001000100101010010

&quot;My name...is Shyoumei Mitsuki. I am 20 years old, and I have been in 
between jobs lately. I...do not have any modeling experience, 
unfortunately, but I can learn. I...I would be more than happy to learn, 
if you would allow me to.&quot;
 
Minako gawked at Mitsuki. 
 
Setsuna smiled softly. &quot;I see...interesting. Are you in school?&quot;
 
&quot;I am going back soon, but I fell off on my studies about a year back. I 
had a...very traumatizing experience, and I lost my...will to do anything at 
all.&quot;
 
Setsuna&#146;s eyes softened in understanding.
 
&quot;I see. Hmm...you sound rather educated.&quot;
 
&quot;I had home schooling when I was younger, as well as boarding school.&quot;
 
&quot;Very interesting indeed. You have an...innocence about you. It&#146;s rather 
endearing.&quot;

Mitsuki&#146;s cheeks reddened slightly.
 
&quot;Thank you.&quot;
 
&quot;How cute,&quot; Michiru whispered to Setsuna.
 
Setsuna nodded, and smiled at Mitsuki.
 
&quot;I believe...that Kunzite has found me a masterpiece. We&#146;ll definitely be 
calling.&quot;
 
Mitsuki gave the other woman a fleeting smile.
 
&quot;Thank you so much, Miss Meiou.&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*
 
She&#146;s staring at you. Probably because you suddenly gained a past in 
five seconds.
 
&quot;Mitsuki?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Do you have something to tell me?&quot;

&quot;I...found it necessary to...to tell a bit of a story.&quot;
 
Minako stared at her quizzically.
 
&quot;That was awfully clever of you.&quot;
 
Mitsuki simply stared ahead.

&quot;I...remember things slowly...but I had to...to improvise.&quot;
 
&quot;I see.&quot;
 
&quot;I...thank you, Minako-comforter.&quot;
 
&quot;For what?&quot;
 
&quot;...For everything.&quot;
 
In time.
 
You lost your will.
 
Remember.
