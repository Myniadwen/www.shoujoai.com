<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 19 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>The year was 3008. Terri and the love of her live have been married 
for a year and a half. Princess Lady Serenity had been born the 13th 
of April 3007. Her eyes were the brilliant red shade destined for her 
and her head was full of cotton candy pink hair. Saturday the new born 
girl turned one.

This years spring air was warm today. The Senshi had congregated on MJ 
(Mercury &amp; Jupiter), Lita and Ami had tied the knot a few months ago. 
They were seated in one of the floating gardens of the kingdom eating 
sweets and laughing. Terri wasn&#146;t sitting with the rest, she and her 
cute little niece were flying in the clouds. Rini made happy baby 
sounds has she looked at the colorful flying birds of MJ fly nearby. 

&#147; Having fun Bunny?&#148; Big red eyes smiled at her and she giggled at the 
bundle in her arms. 

&#147; Terri! Come back down, it&#146;s time for Rini&#146;s nap.&#148; With a few flaps 
of her silvery black wings Terri took them back down with fancy swirls 
and dips. Making little Rini laugh with glee. They landed soon enough 
and Serena cradled her new born in her arms. 

&#147; Bye Bye Bunny!&#148; The Senshi chorused as Serena left into 
large(1)floating castle. Terri walked over to the rest and leaned onto 
Rei.

&#147; I have work to do, wanna come home with me?&#148; Rei looked up at her 
and smiled.

&#147; Sure, we&#146;ll see you guys later.&#148; A wave of bye&#146;s sounded behind them 
and they walked into the castle and through the appropriate archway. 

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*** 

Queen Rei and Queen Terrestria walked through the marble hallways of 
their palace absorbed within themselves. They were close to their 
chambers when General Jayton appeared before them.

&#147; Jayton? What is it?&#148; 

&#147; The scientists have sent me to inform you of a testing of the 
crystals.&#148; Terrestria&#146;s eyes flared. 

&#147; What?! They can&#146;t do that with out a woman! How are they testing?&#148; 
Jayton winced at how angry she was.

&#147; A young female volunteer My Queen.&#148; Terri was fuming and in a 
periwinkle flash was gone. Rei and General Jayton followed close 
behind.

The three wound up in the laboratories of Black Phoenix Palace. 
Terri&#146;s blue gown she had been wearing was gone and replaced by her 
coronation gown. Her crown placed firmly on her atop her white hair. 
She was fuming and Jayton excused himself so he wouldn&#146;t witness her 
fury.

Terrestria banged through the metallic double doors of the operating 
room. One scientist fumbled with his papers while the rest jumped in 
shock. A young light orange haired girl sat on a table, a nervous 
expression fixed on her face. 

&#147; What is going on?!&#148; A dark haired man in blue scrubs started to 
stutter out an explanation to his Queen.

&#147; Well, We&#133;We were attempting to test the crystals your Majesty.&#148; She 
tapped her foot as Rei came over beside her.

&#147; Oh? How were you planning to do that Doctor?&#148; He glanced at his 
fellow scientists and doctors. 

&#147; By&#133;ummm&#133;placing them in this young lady who volunteered?&#148; A low 
growl came from within the Queen&#146;s throat.

&#147; You most certainly will not! You were to report to me before 
starting the procedure. I can not have something go wrong and endanger 
this young woman&#146;s life!&#148; Claming down she walked over to the 
frightened Teres girl. 

&#147; Please don&#146;t be offended. Your are very brave for this, but we can&#146;t 
have something go wrong. A guard will escort you home.&#148; The girl got 
up and bowed before leaving the room to change into her clothes. 
Fuming once again Terrestria turned back to the scared scientists.

&#147; What were you all thinking?&#148; Rei put an arm around her.

&#147; Calm down Dragon. If you don&#146;t want them to test the crystals on our 
people, why not place them in you?&#148; Terri looked surprised by the 
question and turned to her love.

&#147; Your serious? If it works we&#146;ll have a child, and wouldn&#146;t you want 
to be&#133;&#148; Rei chuckled.

&#147; I&#146;m not into all the pain and stress that goes with becoming 
pregnant Dragon. I want a kid, any way possible. If it works we can 
start planning and all that fun junk.&#148; Terri kissed her.

&#147; Alright.&#148; She turned to the calmed scientists and doctors.

&#147; What do you need gentlemen?&#148; They smiled.

&#147; DNA from both of you your Highness.&#148; The married couple sat down and 
started what would change them forever.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

The operation had commenced over and hour ago, all the Senshi paced 
outside the double doors nervously. Rini had no idea what was going on 
so she giggled happily inside her hovering carriage. 

&#147; God I hope nothing goes wrong. Why did I marry someone so noble?&#148; 
Amara pushed Rei into a seat.

&#147; Calm down Rei, your acting like a fool. She&#146;ll be just fine.&#148; Rei 
glared at the tall blonde.

&#147; Don&#146;t tell me to calm down! You would be even worse Amara if it were 
Michelle in there and you know it!&#148; Rei tensed when the metallic doors 
opened to reveal the five scientists and doctor with Terri Hino in a 
wheelchair. They crowded around as Rei took her wife in her arms.

&#147; The operation was successful and we all believe that the crystals 
will indeed work properly. Queen Terrestria is to stay in bed for the 
next forty eight hours, no powers are to be used. After which, if the 
crystals do their job, she can&#146;t teleport unless it&#146;s through one of 
the arch portals. Powers are very limited through out the pregnancy, 
but flying is allowed since it has less effect on the child. I assume 
you will be her obstetrician, Queen Ami?&#148; The blue haired Queen nodded 
and took the file which held the notes of care and information on the 
crystals. 

&#147; I hope all goes well for you your Majesties.&#148; Rei thanked them and 
they disappeared back through the metallic double doors. 

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

A/N: I could stop here and be reaaalllly mean but&#133;I won&#146;t cuz I feel 
like being nice at the moment&#133;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

Monday rolled around quickly as Ami Mizuno finished her check up on 
Terri. She closed the black door and looked happily at her group of 
friends. 

&#147; Well?&#148; Rei looked so anxious it took Ami&#146;s all to not laugh.

&#147; The crystals worked! Terri is now pregnant with your children Rei 
Hino!&#148; Rei jumped up and cried out happily but stopped abruptly to 
stare at her genius friend. The others had too taken notice of Ami&#146;s 
words.

&#147; Wha&#133;did you say child-ren?!?&#148; Ami nodded unable to hide her immense 
grin.

&#147; Yup! Because of the crystals I can tell only after a day or so. You 
guys are gonna have twins!&#148; Rei was stunned as Everyone hugged her 
until she needed oxygen again.

Inside the large bedroom a lone figure snuggled into her blankets and 
laid down. Terri placed a hand to her stomach. Rubbing the material of 
her night gown that covered it. She nestled in and closed her navy 
orbs, a smile gracing her lips. One word raced through her mind as she 
drifted into the land of dreams.

- Twins&#133;-
