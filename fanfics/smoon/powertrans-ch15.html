<a href="../smoon/powertrans-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>A frigid wind sprang up out of nowhere, and Minako hugged herself 
tightly as she looked around, bewildered. Her surroundings seemed 
familiar, but nothing made sense. It was as if nothing she saw really 
made an impression in her mind. Abruptly, she noticed that her legs were 
freezing. Looking down, she realized her had transformed into her Senshi 
fuku. When had she done that? And why was it so cold?

A small sound made her turn. Behind her, Usagi was slumped to the 
ground, and there was someone else holding her up. Was it Ami? Hotaru? 
Minako couldn&#39;t really tell. Both of them looked beaten and worn, as if 
they&#39;d been in a fierce battle, and both were looking at Minako, wide-
eyed with fear. No, not at her...behind her!

Minako spun back. A...darkness...had appeared behind her. A darkness 
that loomed as tall as a mountain and was so terrible, so complete that 
Minako knew that no light could ever really dispel it. It began to reach 
down towards her, and she took a step backwards. 

But she instantly stepped forward once again. A wave of anger swept 
through Minako, and she clenched her fists tightly. For some reason, 
this darkness enraged her like nothing she had ever known. Trembling 
with rage, she brought her hand up. &quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot; The golden ray shot 
into the center of the darkness, but before it hit the wind sprang up 
again, freezing and blinding. Minako hid her face as it howled around 
her ears.    

&quot;Minako!&quot;

With a gasp, Minako shot out of bed. Her legs had become tangled in the 
sheets and she immediately stumbled forward, falling off the bed and 
hitting the ground face-first. She yanked herself to her knees, 
clutching her nose. &quot;Artemis!&quot; She exclaimed, glaring at the cat with 
tears in her eyes.

The white cat was perched on the edge of the bed, trying unsuccessfully 
to hide a grin. &quot;Sorry Minako...you were flailing around so much I had 
to wake you up before you kicked me off the bed.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well...wake me more gently next time.&quot; She muttered, gently 
prodding her nose. 

&quot;I hope that doesn&#39;t swell up before tonight.&quot; Artemis remarked. 

&quot;Why? What&#39;s happening tonight?&quot; Minako asked absently. 

Artemis just stared at her. &quot;It&#39;s Saturday.&quot; Like a shot, Minako sprang 
up and fled to the bathroom, wailing. 

&quot;If my nose is all swollen, I&#39;ll never forgive you Artemis!&quot; She 
shouted, staring at herself in the mirror. After a few minutes, she took 
a deep breath. &quot;I guess it&#39;s okay...&quot; She paused for a moment and 
straightened her hair, unable to keep herself from preening a bit.    

Was it really Saturday? It seemed almost too much to hope for that the 
day had finally arrived. If Minako had had more time to think, she would 
have scheduled her date with Ami earlier in the week. Honestly, the 
suspense was killing the two of them. 

Over the last week, Ami and Minako had shared *maybe* twelve words, and 
those had been halting and punctuated with a large number of blushes and 
funny looks. Rei and Makoto couldn&#39;t stop grinning, and even Usagi was 
beginning to realize that something odd was going on between the Senshi 
of Love and Ice.  

There was an unexpected side effect, however. Minako had left behind her 
trapped sense of panic several days ago. As time went on, her eagerness 
to have the date had grown with the long wait, until all that was left 
of her fear was a cold knot in the pit of her stomach that she could 
ignore unless she concentrated on it.

&quot;Is everything okay?&quot; Artemis inquired, peeking around the doorway. 
Minako turned with a smile. 

&quot;Everything&#39;s in the right place and looking normal.&quot;  
 
&quot;Oh good.&quot; Minako paused at the tone in the cat&#39;s voice.  

&quot;You sound relieved.&quot; She said playfully. &quot;Glad you don&#39;t have to sleep 
in the same room with a big, ugly, swollen nose?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly. I&#39;ve never minded before....agh!&quot; He shook off the 
sopping washcloth that Minako had thrown at his face. &quot;ANYway...&quot; He 
began, starting to clean the water from his face. &quot;I just want to see 
this date go well.&quot;

Minako blinked. &quot;You do?&quot;

Artemis began working very hard to dry himself, as if he were 
embarrassed. &quot;You&#39;ve had enough bad luck for any three people.&quot; He said 
softly. &quot;You&#39;ve got a real chance to be happy with Ami...and I&#39;d really 
like to see that.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Minako turned back to the mirror to hide her blush. Minako and 
Artemis rarely showed their deep affection for each other, and there was 
a long silence as both of them let the rare moment pass. Finally Minako 
grabbed her toothbrush. &quot;Thanks, cat.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Artemis padded out of the bathroom, leaving Minako to get ready 
for the morning. As she brushed her teeth, her mind turned to the dream 
Artemis had woken her from. It seemed odd...different than her usual 
dreams. Almost prophetic...but that was Rei&#39;s area, not hers. *Maybe I 
should ask Rei about it?* She thought to herself. 

However, as she brushed her teeth and her hair, her mind turned ever 
more to the blue haired girl she would be seeing that very night. And as 
she went downstairs to breakfast, lost in a very pleasant daydream, the 
memory of the dream had left her entirely. 

-------------------

Dr. Mizuno smiled as her daughter entered the kitchen. &quot;Good morning!&quot; 
She gushed cheerily, grinning as the rather bleary Ami shot her a lethal 
look. Ami and her mother had a little more time to spend together on 
Saturday mornings than during the week, and Ami took full advantage of 
it, coming down before she was fully alert and awake. Her mother 
generally greeted her with a little good-natured teasing. 

&quot;Here Ami.&quot; Dr. Mizuno set a cup of tea in front of her offspring, and 
Ami began to sip it, coming slowly to life. Her mother set breakfast in 
front of the two of them, and the two began the meal in silence. Once 
Ami had become fully conscious, her mother spoke again. &quot;I&#39;ll have to be 
at the hospital fairly late tonight, so I won&#39;t be around for dinner.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; Ami smiled a little bit, and her mother thought she detected a 
tiny blush on her face. &quot;That&#39;s okay...I was going to tell you I 
wouldn&#39;t be here for dinner either.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Dr. Mizuno smiled softly and tilted her head. &quot;Plans?&quot; For 
reasons she was barely willing to admit to herself, Ami&#39;s mother liked 
to know as much as she could about her daughter&#39;s activities...but she 
knew that sometimes she couldn&#39;t know anything, and that was for the 
best, as much as it worried her. 

&quot;Yes...yes, actually.&quot; Ami took a deep breath, carefully avoiding her 
mother&#39;s eyes. &quot;I, um...I have a date tonight.&quot; 

The teacup Dr. Mizuno had been lifting to her lips paused in midair, 
then came to rest down on the saucer once again. &quot;A date?&quot; She asked, 
pitching her voice carefully. She didn&#39;t want to sound as surprised as 
she felt, as that would embarrass her daughter, but she also wanted to 
let her know how happy she was. &quot;I didn&#39;t even know there was anyone you 
were interested in, Miss Mizuno!&quot; She said with a smile. 

&quot;In a way, I guess I didn&#39;t either.&quot; Ami said, smiling but still not 
meeting her mom&#39;s gaze. &quot;But I really like...this person.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear it Ami.&quot; Dr. Mizuno said gently. With a sly smile, she 
asked, &quot;Is it anyone I know?&quot; 
 
&quot;Well...yes, I guess you could say that...&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Dr. Mizuno thought for a moment. Ami had very few male 
acquaintances, let alone friends. There was that boy...what was his 
name? Urawa? But she didn&#39;t think he was living anywhere nearby anymore. 
And Ami, frankly, had never seemed very interested to begin with. She 
felt a small twitch when she considered Ami&#39;s friend Mamoru. *Far* too 
old...but no, he was with Usagi, and Ami would never do something like 
that. &quot;May I ask who?&quot; She finally asked, when she couldn&#39;t think of 
anyone likely. 

&quot;Mom...I think I&#39;d like it better if you didn&#39;t.&quot; She risked a glance 
up, then looked down sharply once again at the surprised look on her 
mother&#39;s face. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you, if you insist.&quot; She continued in a small 
voice. &quot;And if things turn out well, I *will* tell you sometime...but 
just not now.&quot; She ended in a softly pleading tone. 

The mind of Dr. Mizuno was now in overdrive. What could her daughter be 
talking about? Why wouldn&#39;t she want to tell her? What had Ami been 
doing lately? Nothing that would suggest a budding romance. Well, not 
unless...oh. Oh! Ami&#39;s mother quickly took another sip of her tea to 
hide her face, to conceal a shocked expression. It made sense...it did 
make sense. And she had wondered, at times...

Ami was still waiting expectantly for a response from her mother, so 
finally Dr. Mizuno smiled. &quot;Ami, that&#39;s fine. You can tell me when 
you&#39;re ready.&quot; Ami finally looked up, and smiled in a relieved way at 
her mother&#39;s expression. They returned attention to their breakfast 
then, keeping the conversation light and trivial. 

Ami finally got up and cleaned her plate. As she turned towards her 
bedroom to get dressed, her mother spoke gently. 

&quot;As I said, Ami...you can tell me when you&#39;re ready. And it&#39;s fine, 
whoever it is, it&#39;s fine. I promise. I love you Ami.&quot;

Ami turned to her mother and smiled. &quot;I love you too Mom.&quot;

-------------------

At that moment, deep beneath Tokyo, the daeva Gylax made her way into 
Lady Meson&#39;s control chamber. She had assumed a fully humanoid shape, 
and was not trying to mask her entrance. Both of these were against her 
natural inclinations when entering an uncertain situation, but Meson was 
an assassin of incomparable skill and had been known to slay any daeva 
who displayed even the slightest hint of trying to sneak up on her. 

The liquid daeva entered the cavern, her hollow eyes scanning the 
ghostly-lit floor. She could see nothing but the black fangs of stone 
jutting upward. Abruptly, she sensed she was not alone. A small sphere  
of violet light sailed from the shadows, and Gylax reached up to catch 
it. &quot;Tag! You&#39;re it!&quot; A piping voice said from the sphere&#39;s source. 

&quot;Lady Tachyon.&quot; Gylax bowed her fluid body deeply at the waist. The 
child-like Tachyon stepped into the daeva&#39;s field of vision, giggling, 
her long, glittering knife drawn.

&quot;Gylax...&quot; The tiny seer spoke teasingly. &quot;I saw what you did to 
Gluon...I saw it last week, too, but it was *so* much better when it was 
actually happening.&quot; She giggled again. &quot;I told him he&#39;d die, but he 
still looked surprised. Why do you think that is?&quot; 
 
&quot;Who can say, Lady Tachyon?&quot; Gylax replied, trying to keep her voice 
even. Tachyon&#39;s grin became even broader, and Gylax felt a shudder 
ripple through her quicksilver form. 

&quot;I like you Gylax...maybe you should come work for me...wouldn&#39;t you 
like that?&quot;

&quot;Of...of course, Lady Tachyon. But...I&#39;m afraid Muon has already taken 
me as a servant.&quot;

Tachyon pouted. &quot;That&#39;s too bad.&quot; Her tiny pink tongue licked the edge 
of her knife, and then her lips. &quot;Maybe I can make it so he doesn&#39;t want 
you anymore...&quot; She started walking forward, sweeping her blade through 
the air. 

&quot;Enough, Tachyon.&quot; Meson&#39;s voice rang out through the chamber, and 
Tachyon stopped, much to Gylax&#39;s relief. &quot;You know a blade couldn&#39;t harm 
a creature like Gylax anyway.&quot; 
 
Tachyon just giggled. &quot;Oh, but this is a *special* knife.&quot; Gylax stood 
absolutely still. 

&quot;Nevertheless, you&#39;re not supposed to interfere with Muon. Lord Hadron 
has seen fit to allow Gylax to serve him, so you&#39;re to leave her alone.&quot;  
 
&quot;Oh, fine...&quot; Tachyon pouted, but put away her knife and the violet orb 
vanished from Gylax&#39;s hands. 

&quot;Now, Gylax...&quot; Meson&#39;s voice faded into echoes, and there was a moment 
of silence. Gylax found herself surrounded by a blazing red aura, 
rendering the cavern she was in all but invisible to her. A voice rang 
out, haughty and cold. Gylax almost lost control of her form when she 
realized who was speaking to her. 

&quot;You have been sent to make a report. Do so.&quot; Hadron&#39;s voice spoke in 
her ear. Unable to control her shaking, she managed to deliver her 
report on Gluon&#39;s attack on the Sailor Senshi, his treachery and 
subsequent death. Once she finished, Hadron spoke again. 

&quot;I knew Gluon would turn upon him...and so, it seems, did Muon. What of 
the Death&#39;s Tears?&quot; 
 
&quot;My Lord Hadron...Muon has instructed me to relate that the Tears were 
themselves a test run...a prototype. True application of the principals 
behind them will take more time to develop.&quot; Gylax cringed inwardly. 
Muon had sent her to make this report, claiming he was too busy. But 
privately she suspected that she had been sent to bear the brunt of 
whatever anger this news would create.  

&quot;I see...very well.&quot; To Gylax&#39;s surprise, Hadron did not even sound 
irritated. &quot;You have performed well under Muon&#39;s control, Gylax...should 
he tire of your services before it is too late, I may have a place for 
you in my personal guard.&quot; 
 
&quot;I am honored, my Lord.&quot; Gylax said, kneeling and trying to sound 
sincere. Truly, she wanted nothing more than to remain as Muon&#39;s 
servant...for the first time in her life, she didn&#39;t feel her life was 
constantly in danger. But what did Hadron mean by &#39;before it was too 
late?&#39;

Before she could even decide that asking about that would be a terrible 
idea, Hadron&#39;s presence left her and the red aura faded away, leaving 
her standing alone in the cavern once more. Tachyon could no longer be 
seen. Lady Meson spoke up from the shadows again, choosing to remain 
hidden. 

&quot;You will give this message to Muon. Tell him his personal studies may 
continue unhindered. Furthermore, inform him that due to her very 
favorable findings, Tachyon has been given full control of the operation 
to subjugate the Earth. Any new developments or aid he can offer should 
therefore be offered to her. Now go.&quot; 

Gylax fell into a puddle with a great sense of relief and slithered from 
the room as quickly as possible. She was now doubly glad that she had 
the relative protection of Muon. Even Gluon at his worst had been 
understandable and, to an extent, predictable. Tachyon was completely 
mad...just as likely to torture and kill those daeva working for her as 
her enemies. And with her powers of time, death could be a long, long 
time coming. 

The fluid daeva shuddered a final time, making it appear as if rain was 
falling across her gleaming surface in her pooled state. She wondered 
what horrors the child had in store for the persistent Sailor Senshi. 
She also wondered whether she&#39;d be better off not knowing.

-------------------

It was shortly before six, and Ami was walking up Minako&#39;s street. She 
was either extremely nervous, or experiencing the early warning signs of 
a stroke. In addition to a sick, shaky feeling in the pit of her 
stomach, her hands were trembling and clammy, forcing her to slip her 
hands into her pants to dry them at intervals. And she kept having to 
fight back a fit of the giggles. 

Her mother had managed to secure a short break just as Ami was leaving 
the apartment. Dr. Mizuno had put a few finishing touches on her 
daughters appearance and given her a knowing smile that made Ami very 
nervous indeed. What did her mother know, or think she knew? Did she 
guess at her daughter&#39;s...extracurricular activities? Or did she suspect 
the identity of Ami&#39;s date? If either were true, which would be worse? 
Ami had no idea.  

A white shape suddenly detached itself from the wall Ami was passing 
under and landed on her shoulders. Wound up and not ready for any kind 
of surprise, Ami shrieked and jumped back, spinning in place. The small 
white shape flew off her back and landed lightly on the sidewalk in 
front of her. 

&quot;Little nervous, Ami?&quot; Artemis asked, shaking himself lightly. 

Ami gasped and clapped a hand over her mouth, blushing. &quot;Sorry 
Artemis...I guess I am a little bit nervous.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I land on my feet, right?&quot; He sat down and began 
cleaning his face with a paw. 

After a moment, Ami coughed gently. &quot;Um...Artemis...was there something 
you wanted to talk about?&quot;

Artemis chuckled a little bit. &quot;Not really...I was sent to keep you busy 
for a couple of minutes and it&#39;s too much work trying to fake a 
conversation.&quot; A car that Ami vaguely recognized as belonging to 
Minako&#39;s mother drove past and turned the corner. &quot;Okay, we can go.&quot; He 
started off down the street, and Ami followed after a moment.

&quot;So...Minako didn&#39;t want me to run into her mom?&quot; She asked after a 
moment. 

&quot;Well, you can&#39;t really blame her. Would you want her running into your 
mom tonight?&quot; 

&quot;I guess not.&quot; Ami agreed with a chuckle. &quot;But after the other 
night...I&#39;m realizing there&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t know about Minako. 
Especially where her family&#39;s involved.&quot;

Artemis jumped up onto the wall along the street, drawing level with 
Ami&#39;s head. &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot; He acknowledged. &quot;She doesn&#39;t like to burden 
those around her with her problems. It does help make her a good leader, 
but it&#39;s hard for her to keep all of that in.&quot;

&quot;I understand.&quot; Ami smiled a little sadly. &quot;I don&#39;t really have a 
problem with my parents&#39; relationships with me. I do miss my father, but 
I understand why he needs to be away so much. But still...thinking about 
the divorce still hurts, a lot. And it&#39;s not the sort of thing I like 
talking about either.&quot;

They turned into Minako&#39;s yard, and Artemis hopped off the wall. &quot;Well, 
I&#39;m gonna spend the night with Luna and Diana.&quot; He announced. &quot;Good luck 
Ami...I&#39;m really pulling for you two.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Artemis.&quot; Ami said with a nervous smile, turning from the 
retreating cat to the house which now seemed to loom threateningly at 
her. Ami took a deep breath and closed her eyes. &quot;Here we go Ami...&quot; She 
stepped up to the front door and rang the bell. Her finger had barely 
left the button before the door opened. 

There, of course, was Minako. &quot;Hi Ami-chan.&quot; She said with a timid 
little smile. Ami returned the greeting a little absently. Her eyes 
widened as she took in the sight of her date standing in the doorway. 
Minako looked incredible. She was wearing a sheer blue dress that came 
very close to being an evening gown. It left her right shoulder bare, 
and slid down into a skirt that fell to just below her knees, with a 
slit that went up to her thigh. Her hair fell over her bare shoulder in 
a smooth cascade of shining gold. 

&quot;Mina-chan...you&#39;re beautiful!&quot; Minako beamed, her cheeks turning pink 
at the compliment. Ami bit her lip and looked down at herself, cursing 
her stupidity. She had dressed much more casually, just a pair of storm 
grey slacks and a white dress shirt with a dark blue vest, with a light 
jacket against the cold. The thought of spending the evening with the 
beauty in front of her made her feel, quite bluntly, like a scrub.

Minako tilted her head, frowning a bit. &quot;Ami-chan? Are you okay?&quot;

Ami opened her mouth to speak, but couldn&#39;t say anything. She wanted to 
say she going to run home and change, wanted to say she was sorry for 
ruining the date already. Before she could force a single awkward word 
out, however, Minako was hugging her tightly. 

&quot;You&#39;re a silly girl.&quot; She whispered kindly, understandingly. She held 
Ami out at arm&#39;s length, smiling at the blue-haired girl&#39;s wide eyed, 
blushing expression. &quot;First, you look adorable. Second, I always 
overdress for first dates. I hadn&#39;t realized that the reaction would be 
different when dating another girl. Finally...&quot; She leaned in and rested 
her forehead against Ami&#39;s. &quot;...I just want to be with you. What you&#39;re 
wearing doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

Ami slid in closer to Minako, smiling. As she pressed her face into 
Minako&#39;s shoulder, she became aware of the blonde Senshi&#39;s fragrance, 
lightly floral and utterly intoxicating. Her hands tightened around 
Minako&#39;s waist, and she felt Minako&#39;s warm arms enfolding her. 

Finally Minako spoke in a soft voice. &quot;Ami-chan...if we don&#39;t let go of 
each other, we might never leave the house.&quot; 

Rather regretting the move, Ami let Minako go with a sigh. &quot;I guess 
you&#39;re right...&quot; 

Minako began to pull on a coat. &quot;So Ami-chan...if you didn&#39;t have any 
place picked out, I know a great club we can go to...&quot; At that moment, 
Ami&#39;s stomach rumbled loudly, prompting a blush and a shy smile. &quot;...but 
of course we can get something to eat first.&quot; Minako finished, pulling 
on the sleeve to her coat.

&quot;Thanks Mina-chan.&quot; Ami paused for a moment in the middle of turning 
towards the door. &quot;Mina-chan...it doesn&#39;t really fit your outfit, but 
wouldn&#39;t it be funny to go back to that place where we pretended to be a 
couple?&quot;

Minako laughed and slid her arms around Ami&#39;s shoulders. Ami immediately 
leaned into the contact. &quot;That&#39;s a great idea Ami-chan! And it&#39;s right 
on the way, too.&quot; She slid her hand into the crook of Ami&#39;s arm, and the 
two set off down the street. 

As they walked, Ami felt her eyes slide again and again to the girl who 
held her arm and leaned against her gently. At first, Ami had felt a 
flash of nervousness at walking down the street like this, where anyone 
could see them, but that was wiped away in an instant. Tonight was for 
herself and Minako, and even if their parents and everyone they knew 
were lining the streets looking at them, Ami wouldn&#39;t care. This felt so 
good, so right, that nothing else mattered.

The little American cafe was just a few streets away from Minako&#39;s house, 
so they reached it in what seemed like no time at all. A different 
hostess than before greeted them and said they could be seated right 
away. She did a little double take when Minako asked for a booth in the 
back and she noticed how close the two seemed to be. But then she just 
smiled warmly. &quot;Right this way!&quot;

When they were seated, she handed them their menus. &quot;Your server will be 
with you shortly.&quot; She smiled warmly and left them smiling at one 
another from across the table. 

After a moment, Minako giggled gently, prompting a questioning look from 
Ami. &quot;You know...you could join me over here.&quot; The Senshi of Love said 
coyly. &quot;I&#39;m kinda cold.&quot; She mock-pouted.

Ami blushed. &quot;R-right...&quot; She looked around furtively and quickly 
slipped out of her seat and into the padded bench next to Minako. Minako 
immediately slipped her hand into Ami&#39;s and held it gently on the seat 
between them. 

&quot;You&#39;re so nervous.&quot; Minako said teasingly. &quot;It&#39;s really cute.&quot; She was 
leaning her chin on her other hand, propped on her elbow on the table. 
She was smiling, but Ami could see a lot of nervousness in her eyes. 
With a small shock, Ami remembered that Minako, despite her greater 
dating experience, was probably just as scared about this as Ami was 
herself. In a way, perhaps even more so. 

Ami lightly disentangled her hand from Minako&#39;s and caressed the other 
girl&#39;s cheek with the back of her fingers. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mina-chan.&quot; She 
said with a self-depracating chuckle. &quot;I&#39;m pretty new at this whole 
dating thing. And I feel like I&#39;ve been thrown into the deep end.&quot;

&quot;How do you mean?&quot; Minako asked curiously, pushing her cheek lightly 
against Ami&#39;s fingers. 

&quot;I&#39;m on a date with the most beautiful girl in the world.&quot; Ami said with 
quiet certainty. Minako blushed and inched closer to Ami, until they 
were touching. She leaned against the blue-haired girl, resting her head 
on her arm. Ami slid her arm around Minako&#39;s shoulders and leaned her 
head against hers. 

&quot;You&#39;re really sweet.&quot; Minako murmured. 
 
&quot;Just telling the truth.&quot; Ami responded, turning her head slightly and 
breathing deeply the sweet smell of Minako&#39;s hair. 

Minako giggled. &quot;I didn&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t true...just that you&#39;re sweet 
for saying it.&quot; Ami laughed softly in return. The polite sound of a 
clearing throat made them both blink and look up. The same waiter who 
had served them on their last visit there was standing in front of their 
booth, notepad ready. 

&quot;I can come back if you&#39;re busy.&quot; He said with a grin.

Minako looked up at Ami, who was looking down at her. &quot;Um...no, I think 
we&#39;re ready?&quot; Ami shrugged and nodded. Minako reached out and grabbed 
the nearest menu, quickly scanning over it and picking the first item 
that looked halfway appetizing, just a cheeseburger and fries. She held 
it out and Ami immediately ordered the same thing.  

&quot;Great.&quot; The server said, taking the menus. &quot;Separate drinks, or did you 
want one glass and two straws again?&quot;

Ami blushed. &quot;No, I think two drinks will be fine.&quot; 

As the waiter left, Minako pouted a bit. &quot;Awww, I sort of liked the two 
straw thing.&quot;

&quot;I would feel silly doing it for real.&quot; Ami said, tracing her finger 
over the soft skin of Minako&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Besides, Mina-chan...&quot; She 
said, giving the blonde girl a sidelong glance, &quot;I don&#39;t think we need 
to play at indirect kisses anymore, do you?&quot;

&quot;Ami-chan!&quot; Minako grinned, then shifted around till her face had drawn 
level with Ami&#39;s. &quot;Well, maybe you&#39;re right.&quot; She slowly leaned her face 
in towards Ami, who immediately closed her eyes and leaned forward as 
well, displaying an eagerness that surprised them both. In a sudden fit 
of impishness, Minako waited until the last moment, then laid two 
fingers gently on Ami&#39;s lips. &quot;But later.&quot; 

Ami opened her mouth to protest, but sucked in her breath sharply, her 
cheeks flushed. Minako was whispering, her warm breath and lips brushing 
against Ami&#39;s ear, leaving the girl utterly unable to move or speak. 
&quot;When we kiss for the very first time, I want to make sure you never 
forget it.&quot; Ami shivered slightly despite suddenly feeling very warm 
indeed. The warmth around her ear left suddenly, and Ami swallowed, 
glancing over at Minako, who was innocently tracing a design on the 
tabletop with her finger and smiling to herself.  

&quot;Tease.&quot; Ami said, making a face at her...girlfriend. She rolled the 
word around in her mind, examining how it felt when applied by her to 
Minako. She smiled broadly, and Minako gave her a funny look. 

&quot;Are you okay Ami-chan? You look a little out of it.&quot; 
 
Ami just kept smiling. &quot;You&#39;re my girlfriend.&quot; She finally said happily. 

Minako blushed furiously, unable to keep herself from smiling either. 
&quot;That&#39;s not fair!&quot; She complained. Then she started laughing. &quot;You&#39;re my 
girlfriend too.&quot; She said in a silly tone of voice. Ami joined in the 
laughter as well, and in a moment they were in each other&#39;s arms, 
shaking with laughter that they tried to keep restrained for the sake of 
the other diners. 

After several minutes, Minako released Ami, both of them quite 
breathless at this point. Minako cupped her girlfriend&#39;s cheeks in her 
palms and looked into her eyes. &quot;You&#39;ve made me so happy Ami-chan.&quot; She 
said softly. Her hand slid up and she gently ran her fingers through the 
other girl&#39;s blue hair. &quot;Thank you so much.&quot; 

Ami reached up and took Minako&#39;s hand in her own, gently kissing the 
knuckles one by one. &quot;Thank you Mina-chan...you make me happy too.&quot; She 
sniffed suddenly, and looked down at the table. She began to blush. 
Their food and drinks were sitting on the table in front of them. &quot;I 
guess we were a little distracted.&quot; She chuckled.

Minako laughed as well. &quot;I guess we were.&quot; She picked up a fry and gave 
Ami a sly look. Ami smiled back at her uncertainly. 

&quot;Oh Mina-chan...no...I hate that, it&#39;s so...&quot; Minako just held the fry 
in front of Ami&#39;s mouth, and with a resigned sigh Ami opened her mouth 
and lightly plucked the food from Minako&#39;s hand. Minako blushed. 

&quot;Oh...Ami-chan...&quot; She didn&#39;t say anything else for a long moment. 
Finally Ami&#39;s curiosity overcame her sense of decorum and she held a fry 
to Minako&#39;s mouth as well. As Minako took it between her lips and gently 
pulled it from her fingers, a warm flush spread throughout Ami&#39;s body, 
and she shivered again.  
 
&quot;Oh...&quot; Ami said faintly. &quot;So that&#39;s why everyone does that...&quot; Minako 
just giggled and grabbed another fry. 

When they had fully decimated their supply, Ami licked her lips and 
chuckled. &quot;I would have thought that was absolutely sickening if I 
hadn&#39;t been the one doing it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...it&#39;s amazing how much better the cutesy stuff is when you&#39;re the 
one being cutesy.&quot; Minako agreed, once again laying her head against 
Ami&#39;s arm. She looked down at the two burgers on the table. &quot;I&#39;m not 
really hungry anymore.&quot; 

&quot;Me either.&quot; Ami said. &quot;Shall we go then?&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh, lets.&quot; Ami paid for the food, but Minako left a very generous tip 
for their waiter. &quot;After all, he didn&#39;t disturb us at all, and that 
deserves a reward!&quot;

They left the cafe and headed down the street once again. &quot;Just so you 
know, Ami-chan, I&#39;ve never been to this place before, but it got a 
really good recommendation.&quot;

&quot;Um...okay...&quot; Ami snuggled a bit closer to Minako as they walked. &quot;You 
know I&#39;m not really used to clubs or anything, right?&quot;

Minako smiled and gently kissed Ami on the forehead. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll 
be fine. I promise.&quot; Ami blushed and nodded. 

The club Minako had her sights on was a fairly short walk from the cafe, 
on the way to the Outer Senshi&#39;s place. There was a tall woman standing 
next to the door, and Minako stopped Ami. &quot;Just one second.&quot; Ami nodded 
and Minako walked over and said something to the woman, who smiled 
broadly, nodded and opened the door. Minako beckoned to Ami, who quickly 
followed, wondering exactly what was going on. 

Hand in hand they entered the place. There was dance music with a 
pounding beat, though there was a bar close to the entrance, and by a 
trick of acoustics that impressed Ami it was quiet enough to be heard 
without shouting there. 

It was to the bar that Minako led Ami, and as they made their way 
through the crowd something began to register with Ami. The crowd seemed 
to be fairly young, all college age kids with a scattering of high 
schoolers like the two of them, but all female. And when they passed a 
couple of girls passionately making out on the edge of the dance floor, 
Ami blushed and paused. &quot;Mina-chan...&quot; She called out, and Minako 
stopped and looked back, a grin on her face. &quot;Who recommended this place 
to you?&quot;

&quot;Haruka and Michiru.&quot; She said innocently, still grinning. Her eyes 
flickered over to the couple Ami had seen. &quot;Why do you ask, Ami-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, no reason...&quot; Minako walked over and gave the blue-haired girl a 
warm hug, murmuring in her ear. 

&quot;I thought a place like this would be better for a first date...less 
chance of some jerk giving us a hard time, you know?&quot;

Ami smiled back and nodded, returning the hug. &quot;I see...that&#39;s a good 
idea, Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako winked. &quot;I have a few of those.&quot; She continued to lead Ami 
through the crowd to the bar, where a dark-haired woman was shuffling 
drinks across the bartop.  
 
&quot;What can I get you two?&quot; She asked as they approached. &quot;No beer, 
obviously.&quot;
 
&quot;Obviously.&quot; Minako laughed. &quot;Actually, I was just told to say hi when 
we got here...you&#39;re Kin, right?&quot;

&quot;Right...&quot; Kin said, slowly. Then she broke into a smile. &quot;Ahhh, you two 
must be Haruka&#39;s friends. She mentioned you might be here. Yeah, I&#39;m 
Kin.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Minako, and this is Ami. Nice to meet you.&quot; 

Ami nodded, smiling shyly. &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; Kin grinned at Ami, then 
back at Minako. 

&quot;You two are really cute together.&quot; She said. &quot;First date, right?&quot; 
Minako nodded. &quot;Great! Well, I&#39;ll leave you two alone then.&quot; She winked. 
&quot;Enjoy the place, I think you&#39;ll like it.&quot;

Minako hugged Ami tightly around the waist and pressed her cheek against 
Ami&#39;s. &quot;So...wanna dance?&quot; Minako giggled.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Ami said with a nervous smile, slipping her hand into 
Minako&#39;s. In truth, Ami didn&#39;t dance to fast songs all that much...slow 
dances, waltzes, that sort of thing she could do, but she hoped that 
Minako would go easy on her here...

They stepped out onto the dance floor. The music was pounding, the 
lights were flashing and there were women dancing everywhere. Ami felt 
terribly out of her element, but Minako was obviously so completely 
comfortable here that some of her confidence actually managed to rub off 
on her girlfriend. 

Minako turned to face Ami. Some of Ami&#39;s deer-in-the-headlights 
sensation must have been showing, because the blonde girl gave her a 
very sweet, understanding smile. She began to move to the movement, 
keeping her actions very simple. Warmth spread through Ami as she 
realized Minako was helping her, and she nodded, mimicking Minako. It 
felt very awkward at first, but as she continued to move, it got easier, 
and she could just follow the beat rather than mirror Minako.

When Ami had the first move down, Minako threw in a new move. For the 
several minutes the first song lasted, this continued. Minako showing 
Ami a new dance move every time she mastered the last. When it finished 
and there was a slight pause, Minako slipped up against Ami and murmured 
in her ear. &quot;You&#39;re doing great Ami-chan!&quot; Ami beamed, feeling rather 
proud of herself. 

When the next song started, Ami was loose enough that she didn&#39;t even 
have to check to see what Minako was doing. She just started moving 
along with the music. The two girls kept looking into each other&#39;s eyes 
as they danced. To Ami, it was like the rest of the club and everyone in 
it slid away into a gray haze. Barely even realizing it, the two senshi 
moved closer to one another, until they were almost touching. 

For five more songs they stayed out on the dance floor. Finally, Ami 
signaled for a break, and Minako nodded. They joined hands and slipped 
away, finding a small, empty table near the bar to sit at. They sat 
across from each other and Minako reached out and took Ami&#39;s wrists in 
her hands. &quot;See? That wasn&#39;t so bad.&quot; She winked. 

&quot;Not at all!&quot; Ami said, smiling and flushed pink. &quot;I...I don&#39;t think 
I&#39;ve ever had that much fun dancing.&quot; She looked down and to the side, 
smiling softly. &quot;Thank you Mina-chan.&quot; 
 
Minako squeezed Ami&#39;s hands gently, beaming. &quot;I don&#39;t think I have 
either...it must be because I have such a great partner.&quot;

Ami blushed. &quot;You&#39;re just saying that.&quot;  
 
&quot;No, I&#39;m not.&quot; Minako said earnestly, leaning over the table. &quot;Ami-
chan...I&#39;ve never, ever danced with anyone I cared about as much as I 
care about you. Just being around you makes me feel special...actually 
going out with you like this feels like a dream come true.&quot; 
 
Ami was blushing furiously at this point, but she was smiling too. 
&quot;Mina-chan...&quot; She looked like there was more she wanted to say, but at 
that point the two girls got lost in each other&#39;s eyes, just gazing 
dreamily at one another as their fingers played together. 

Ami looked at Minako with a cute little smile. &quot;Would you mind if we 
took a little walk?&quot;

Minako shook her head with a smile. &quot;Not at all, but we haven&#39;t really 
been here that long.&quot; 
 
Ami looked down a bit, preparing herself for a bit of boldness. &quot;I 
know...but I think I&#39;d like to cool down. Besides...&quot; She looked up and 
gave Minako a look full of the strong emotions that had built up on the 
dance floor. &quot;We haven&#39;t had much time alone together.&quot;

Minako grinned. &quot;No...I guess we haven&#39;t.&quot; She stood, and Ami joined her. 
Hand in hand, they left the club, waving to Kin as they slipped out. 

The street outside was shockingly cold compared to the intense, heated 
atmosphere of the club behind them, and they hugged each other close as 
they walked down the street. Ami led them now, with a place in mind, and 
Minako was obviously content to let her do so. 

They soon arrived at the park, and walked in without hesitation. Of 
course, normally a park at night in a big city should be off limits for 
two attractive teenagers, but these two were uniquely suited to take 
care of themselves. The sky was dark and overcast, so the only light 
came from the streetlights placed along the walkways. 

They headed to the lake, and Minako realized that Ami was taking them to 
the place Minako had shown her back when they had been studying together, 
what seemed like so long ago. Sure enough, that is where they ended up. 
Across the lake, the skyline of Tokyo rose over the park, the night 
lights glimmering like jewels in black velvet. 

Ami took her jacket off and laid it on the soft grass for Minako, with a 
gallant feeling she wasn&#39;t used to, but liked quite a bit. Minako sat 
down, and Ami sat next to her. Minako shifted around and lay her head in 
Ami&#39;s lap, just as she had when she had been injured and Ami had visited. 

&quot;Isn&#39;t it funny?&quot; Ami murmured. 

&quot;Isn&#39;t what funny?&quot; 
 
&quot;How different things we&#39;ve done before feel, now that 
we&#39;re...together?&quot; Minako smiled up at her. In the silvery light of the 
distant city, her face seemed particularly beautiful. 

&quot;It&#39;s true...well...I guess the feeling is the same, it&#39;s just much 
stronger.&quot; 
 
Ami nodded. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right, Mina-chan.&quot; She chuckled softly, 
tracing her fingertip along Minako&#39;s cheek and chin. Minako made a small, 
deep sound of pleasure and tilted her head back, exposing her neck. Ami 
began sliding her finger there as well. &quot;I guess that means we&#39;ve liked 
each other for longer than we realized.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re pretty much hopeless, aren&#39;t we?&quot; Minako said in a soft 
tone. She looked up at Ami again. &quot;What do we do now? About us, I mean?&quot;

Ami bit her lip and shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know...I guess we have to tell 
the others soon...that would be much better than letting Rei and 
Makoto&#39;s imaginations run away with them.&quot;

Minako laughed softly. &quot;I don&#39;t know...that might be funny...especially 
if they brought Usagi in on it.&quot; 
 
Ami rolled her eyes. &quot;Oh no...can you even imagine the three of them 
trying to spy on us?&quot;

Minako giggled. &quot;They&#39;re just so bad at that sort of thing. Well, I 
guess we all are, really.&quot;

&quot;True enough.&quot; With a tender smile, Ami caressed Minako&#39;s cheek, 
prompting her to lean into the warm touch. &quot;I really don&#39;t think we need 
to tell our parents about this yet...that can wait.&quot; 
 
&quot;Till about forever.&quot; Minako agreed, nodding. Ami laughed, but a little 
pinprick of doubt suddenly poked at her mind. When *should* she tell her 
mother? And should she call or write to her father, if it came to that 
point? How would they react? And what about Minako&#39;s parents? Would 
their seeming indifference extend to this as well, or would there be 
some kind of protective backlash? She could see that happening...it all 
sort of depended...
 
Quite abruptly, Ami found herself pushed back against the grass with 
Minako&#39;s warm form pressed on top of her and a bit to the side. &quot;You&#39;re 
thinking too much again.&quot; Minako said, smiling. There was a light 
dancing in her eyes that seemed independent of the reflected light from 
the city. 

Ami smiled, suddenly feeling excited to the point of trembling. &quot;I guess 
it&#39;s a failing I have...&quot; She whispered. 

&quot;Well,&quot; Minako almost purred, drawing her face in closer. &quot;I&#39;ll have to 
help you with that.&quot;  
 
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Ami breathed. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; With that, Minako&#39;s lips closed on Ami&#39;s. It might have been 
sheer imagination, but Ami would swear that she saw a spark spring up at 
that first contact. She saw nothing else for a long time, as her eyes 
fluttered closed and her arms closed low around Minako&#39;s back. Ami felt 
as if she was floating in a warm haze as the kiss stretched on. Finally, 
Minako pulled back just a bit, and their heavy breathing fogged in the 
cold night air. 

&quot;I told you it would be unforgettable.&quot; She said in a teasing whisper. 
Ami looked at her with longing and rolled over, pushing Minako back 
against the ground this time and looping her arms beneath Minako&#39;s 
shoulders to cradle her head. Minako&#39;s golden hair spread beneath her 
like a blanket as Ami kissed her, kissed her deeply and passionately, 
with a fierceness that Ami hadn&#39;t guessed she could posses. Her body 
clove to Minako&#39;s as if she wanted to meld with the other girl. 

As the kisses deepened in intensity, they reached the point at which 
they had to either stop or go further, and neither was willing to go 
further just yet. So they slowed down, finally exchanging soft, wet 
kisses and hugging each other tightly, laying on their side. 

Ami smiled. &quot;I love you.&quot; At those words, Minako froze, staring wide-
eyed at Ami. Quickly, Ami placed two fingers to the blonde Senshi&#39;s lips. 
&quot;Shhh...it&#39;s okay. You don&#39;t have to say anything. I think I understand 
why you can&#39;t say it...and it&#39;s okay, Mina-chan...I know you feel it.&quot; 

Tears welled up in Minako&#39;s eyes, and Ami felt them in her own as well. 
They hugged tightly once again, their chins resting on eachother&#39;s 
shoulders. Ami felt Minako&#39;s tears sliding hotly on her neck, and Ami 
smiled. She hadn&#39;t made a conscious decision to tell Minako that, in 
fact if she had thought about it she might have decided it was a bad 
idea. But she did...she loved Minako. Ami had no idea when it had 
finally happened, but she was now completely in love with the golden-
haired beauty she held in her arms. There was nobody else she wanted, 
nothing more she more desired than to be with this girl. 

&quot;Ami-chan...you&#39;re wonderful.&quot; Minako said softly, sniffling a bit. Ami 
pulled her head back and lightly kissed the tears from her love&#39;s face. 
Minako closed her eyes and smiled. &quot;I *do* feel it too, Ami-chan...and 
I&#39;ll say it, I swear.&quot; She opened her eyes and looked at Ami 
entreatingly. &quot;I just need more time.&quot;

Ami smiled gently. &quot;As much as you need.&quot; Minako looked up. 

&quot;Ami-chan...look.&quot; Looking up, Ami saw that it was snowing, an early 
snow and the first one of the year. Both sat up, cuddling one another as 
they watched the white flakes drift down into the dark lake. The whole 
world seemed still and quiet. 

As the snow began to stick around them, Ami sighed. &quot;I guess we should 
go before it starts falling any harder.&quot; 
 
Minako smiled. &quot;I guess so...but I don&#39;t feel cold at all.&quot; 
 
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever feel cold again, as long as I&#39;m with you Mina-
chan.&quot; Ami said. Minako hugged her a bit tighter. 

&quot;Ami...&quot;

&quot;Minako...&quot;

It ended up taking a long while before they finally stood and left for 
home, leaving their footprints in the light snowfall. And as Ami finally 
lay in her bed, looking up at the ceiling, she could still feel the 
warmth of her love, as if she were still lying beside her. And she knew 
Minako felt the same. 

-------------------
AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES: For once in my life, I wanted to see a first date go off 
without a hitch, even if I had to write it myself. I also thought it 
would be interesting, as well as helpful for the story in the future,  
to do the first date largely from Ami&#39;s point of view, rather than 
Minako&#39;s.

So, after a long pause and a lot of work, the first date. But there&#39;s 
much more to come as we enter Season 2, so stay tuned!</pre>
