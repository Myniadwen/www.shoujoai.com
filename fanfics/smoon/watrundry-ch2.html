<h1>Water Runs Dry (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/psychokitten.html">PsYcHoKiTtEnSeNsHi611</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/watrundry-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	Eros looked at the two mortal women, walking hand in hand 
down the pathway.  The two women were similar in height, the 
dark haired one just slightly taller than the one with soft 
pink hair.  Both were nude, but did not act any differently 
around each other.  Both were beautiful.  He smiled to himself, 
and then turned to his lovely wife Psyche.
	&quot;Darling,&quot; she said, her beautiful voice pale to the 
sight of her big green eyes.  &quot;I want them to be happy.&quot;  She 
sighed, and turned to his eyes.  &quot;Can&#39;t you grant them 
happiness?&quot;
	&quot;All I can do, my love,&quot; he replied, his voice heavy with 
defeat, &quot;is make them love each other .  They already love each 
other.  They just can&#39;t be together.&quot;
	&quot;But WHY?!&quot;  Psyche wailed in a high-pitched tone.  &quot;Why 
can&#39;t they be together?&quot;
	&quot;That is not up to me.  I am not the one who decides 
their fate.&quot;  He turned to his only love, and smiled a sad 
smile.  &quot;That is up to them, and them alone, my love.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;ChibiUSA!&quot;  Hotaru yelled, her body bouncing in the 
force of her hard running.  &quot;Wait!&quot;  She ran towards her friend 
and lover, smiling.
	ChibiUSA turned at the sound of her name, and smiled at 
the black-haired girl.  &quot;Hey Taru-chan!  How are you?&quot;  She 
smiled again as Hotaru doubled over, breathing heavily.
	&quot;I&#39;m fine...&quot;  She breathed.  Her cheeks were stained a 
pinkish color, adding to the darkness of her eyes.  &quot;You&#39;re 
deaf, you know that?  I&#39;ve been calling your name for the last 
mile or so.  I told you I&#39;d meet you at the arcade!&quot;  She said, 
a little exasperated.
	&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Taru-chan.&quot;  She smiled at her lover.  &quot;I 
forgot.  I was kind of...&quot;
	&quot;...Lost in thought?&quot;  Hotaru smiled a lopsided smile.  
&quot;Chibi-chan, you&#39;re always lost in thought.  What were you 
thinking about this time?&quot;
	ChibiUSA turned on her heels and faced toward the sunset.  
She watched the lights of Tokyo come on in a matter of seconds, 
and remembered a time that was tucked away in her heart-of-
hearts.  Usagi  and Mamoru had been taking her to buy some 
Curry ingredients, and they had held her hands on this very 
spot while the sun went down.  She smiled in remembrance, and 
with a new sense of understanding.  What they had gone through 
was horrible, but it had brought them together in the end.  Her 
future father had told her, one night over dinner, that if he 
could take anything back, he would have told Usagi about his 
horrible dreams.  He told her that the dreams were meant to be 
voiced, and not to be held inside, where no one could help.  So 
ChibiUSA turned back around just as the final rays of the sun 
sunk beneath the horizon.  
	&quot;I was thinking of those dreams I have, Taru-chan.&quot;
	Hotaru was silent for a long time.  She was searching for 
the correct words to say, something that would comfort her best 
friend and lover.  She had always found them, but wasn&#39;t so 
sure this time.  &quot;Chibi-chan... I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; she 
admitted.  &quot;Tell me how we can solve this.&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t know, Hotaru.&quot;  ChibiUSA felt a small tear form 
on her cheek.  &quot;Please make them go away...&quot;  She started to 
sob, small diamonds flowing from her eyes.
	&quot;Oh, Chibi-chan...&quot;  Hotaru gathered the only slightly 
smaller girl in her arms.  She remembered a time where this 
happened regularly.  She smiled slightly.  ChibiUSA always had 
strange dreams, and was slightly psychic.  &quot;Your dreams always 
mean something, and they&#39;re just a test... like your mother&#39;s 
and father&#39;s.  We can survive everything, remember that!  We 
can survive it all!  We have!&quot;  She pulled the smaller girl 
away to look inside her deep red eyes.  &quot;Remember, our love is 
just as meant to be as your mother&#39;s and father&#39;s, even though 
a queen hasn&#39;t told us so.  We know it&#39;s meant to be, because 
I&#39;ve never loved anyone as much as I love you.  I never have 
and never will.&quot;
	ChibiUSA smiled, but the tears didn&#39;t stop falling.  But 
she knew now that they weren&#39;t out of fear, but out of 
happiness.  &quot;And I you, Hotaru-chan.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Darling!&quot;  Someone yelled into the abyss.  &quot;Darling!  
Wake up!&quot;
	ChibiUSA fluttered her eyelids, and sat up straight.  The 
dream was strange this time.  She had been walking with Hotaru 
along a pathway, much like in the other dreams.  She wasn&#39;t on 
a bridge anymore, and there wasn&#39;t some strange stream that 
seemed to draw her attention.
	This time, there had been other people.
	A man and a woman, smiling down at the two of them.  They 
had been walking, naked, as usual, but this time that horrible 
earthquake didn&#39;t break the two apart.  This time, they just 
peacefully made love on the banks of a river.  Hotaru had said 
something in a low voice to ChibiUSA, and suddenly the dream 
world went white.  Something had happened, and she didn&#39;t have 
any idea what.
	&quot;You make me so happy, Chibi-chan.  You make me feel so 
wonderful.&quot;  Hotaru had said, her naked body framed above her 
own.
	&quot;You make me feel just as wonderful, my firefly.&quot;  The 
kiss had been wonderful, long, and sweet.  The climax had been 
more so, and ChibiUSA would have sworn up and down she had felt 
it, that this was real, that they had shared yet another moment 
basking in the glow their love made together.
	ChibiUSA didn&#39;t understand this at all.
	But, for the time being, what had woken her up?  A voice, 
a beautiful female voice... something that reminded her of a 
goddess.  A beautiful goddess.
	Like Hotaru.
	&quot;What&#39;s going on, Chibi?&quot;  Hotaru sat up in bed, leaning 
on her elbows.  The blue satin sheets slipped down below her 
perfect breasts, and ChibiUSA couldn&#39;t help but swallow hard.
	&quot;Nothing...&quot;
	&quot;You had another dream, didn&#39;t you?&quot;  Hotaru closed her 
eyes slightly, then looked up at her lover.  &quot;You can tell me 
all about it, Chibi.&quot;
	&quot;No, Hotaru...I mean I had a dream, but it wasn&#39;t like 
you think it was.  It was... it was... nice.  A nice dream, 
Hotaru.&quot;  Chibi smiled.  &quot;For once, it was just us two 
together, on the bank of a river.&quot;
	&quot;What were we doing?&quot;  Hotaru asked, wanting to confirm 
her own suspicions.
	ChibiUSA broke out in a grin, and nudged her lover.  
&quot;What do you think, Hotaru?&quot;  She laughed, and reached her arms 
around the dark-haired girl&#39;s waist.  Her hands traveled down 
her hips to her thighs, and she heard the intake of breath 
emerge from the woman beside her.
	&quot;Well...&quot;  She breathed.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure... I think you 
should explain it to me...&quot;
	&quot;Hmm...&quot;  ChibiUSA said in a deep, seductive voice.  &quot;You 
were laying on top of me...&quot;
	&quot;Like this?&quot;  Hotaru rolled over so that she was 
positioned on top of the smaller girl.
	&quot;Yes, exactly like that.&quot;  ChibiUSA said, laughing a 
little.
	&quot;Then what were we doing, Chibi-chan?&quot;  Hotaru smiled, 
her dark eyes twinkling.
	&quot;Then, you were sliding your hands up my thighs...&quot;
	&quot;Like this?&quot;  Hotaru immediately complied, her right hand 
sliding up ChibiUSA&#39;s right leg and thigh.
	&quot;Just like that.&quot;  She gasped as Hotaru&#39;s small hand slid 
up her thighs and reached their junction.  &quot;Then... you were 
touching me...&quot;
	&quot;Oh really?&quot;  Hotaru smiled seductively.  &quot;Like this?&quot;  
Her long fingers touched the junction of ChibiUSA&#39;s thighs just 
slightly, and the pink haired girl&#39;s legs spread as a reflex.
	&quot;Yesss...&quot;
	&quot;Hmm... really?&quot;  Hotaru slid a finger inside of her 
lover&#39;s most secret treasure, feeling her inner muscles clamp 
down on her finger.  &quot;Just like that?&quot;  The finger slid deeper 
inside, and Chibi&#39;s muscles tightened further.
	Chibi&#39;s nod was so emphasized she almost got a headache.  
But she didn&#39;t have time to focus on it, not with Hotaru above 
her, staring into her eyes and thrusting her finger inside of 
her.  Her pleasure grew and grew, heat mounting on top of heat 
until she almost reached boiling point.  Chibi could see the 
dream clearly now, the blue satin sheets of their bed being 
replaced by the warm earth of the ground.  Hotaru only dimly 
noticed the change of surroundings, the darkness of the room 
being replaced by the light of the Moon and the planet Saturn 
in the sky.  The two planets began to glow together in the 
warmth of the love these two women shared, glowing as brightly 
as their eyes.  Tall plants surrounded them, and smells that 
were foreign but somehow familiar flew inside their nostrils.
	&quot;Chibi-chan...&quot;  Hotaru groaned, her finger slowing it&#39;s 
movement.  She couldn&#39;t bear the separation anymore.
	ChibiUSA grasped her lover&#39;s shoulders and kissed her 
fiercely, her hips rising with need as she felt that one small 
finger sliding out of her.  But, when she felt the reassuring 
presence of Hotaru&#39;s hips upon her own, she knew it wouldn&#39;t be 
long.  The kiss deepened and intensified as the lovely feeling 
of joining swept over her heated flesh.
	&quot;Oh God, Chibi...&quot;  Hotaru thrust her head upwards, her 
back arching and pert nipples reaching toward the purple sky.  
&quot;I love you forever, my princess...&quot;  Suddenly, her sweaty body 
was framed in the glow of her own planet, and ChibiUSA gasped 
with the sudden beauty of it all.  She quickly grabbed her 
lover close to her, lips touching and mingling as tongues and 
hips danced in an erotic rhythm made only for them.
	In the sky, the Moon and Saturn began to gravitate toward 
each other, the light intensifying until the sky became white.  
Moans from their deities intensified as well, as their own 
climaxes grew and grew.
	Chibi was dimly aware of the light, but knew it only 
served her better, giving her a better look at this woman above 
her.  The thrusting grew harder and harder, hips touching in 
the lightest butterfly kiss as it intensified.  Chibi wanted 
this to go on and on forever, this wonderful exquisite dance of 
love that sent her flying into the abyss.  Hotaru was moaning 
more and more, low sounds that just served to turn her pink 
haired love into a puddle of liquid heat.
	&quot;Oh God Hotaru... please don&#39;t stop... don&#39;t... please... 
I love you... forever...&quot;  Chibi arched upward to her lover as 
her climax approached, her eyes opening to see the joining of 
the two great planets in the now white sky.  She watched, 
through her own shuddering and bucking of her hips, feeling 
Hotaru&#39;s grasp around her tighten, and feeling Hotaru&#39;s eyes 
look up from her mouth to the sky as well.
	The planets became one in the sudden fantastic display of 
power.  They glowed with a white light that shown for them 
only.  The light found itself and formed a beam that came down 
to the lovers and landed lightly on their foreheads.  The light 
grew and grew again, and a symbol came upon them.  A Moon and 
the Saturn planet, surrounded by a heart.  When the beam of 
light touched them, the cried out in pure ecstasy, and the 
world around them went white.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hotaru&#39;s eyes opened slowly and carefully.  She found it 
to be fairly safe... staring into Chibi&#39;s breasts.  That was 
always a welcome sight.  She smiled.
	She sat up and looked around, noting the fact that she 
was back in their bedroom.  The small apartment was cramped, 
but they managed.  They could deal with all of this.  They 
would deal with all of this.  Especially after a night like 
tonight... no one could deny the power that they possessed when 
they were around each other.  Let the end of the world come, 
she would be ready, because in their Utopia she knew she would 
be with her one and only love.
	Together forever.
	Hotaru slipped out of bed to get a drink of water, 
heading for the nearby bathroom.  She turned on the light and 
turned on the sink, using a small cup that was by the sink.  As 
she was drinking, she glanced in the mirror.
	She spit the water out onto the mirror in horror.
	On her forehead, a pink outline of a heart, a Moon, and 
another planet was engrained.
