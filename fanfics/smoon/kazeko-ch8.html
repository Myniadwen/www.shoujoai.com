<h1>Kazeko (part 8 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;It&#39;s lovely.  Light blue is a good color for you, Kaiou-san.&quot;
 
Michiru smiled as Ailan delicately embroidered silver filigree on the 
hem of her skirt.  Her many assistants were finishing with the 
bridesmaids, and each one was wearing a slightly different dress.  While 
the basic design was the same, each woman had asked for a different 
color and pattern.  Ailan was willing to oblige.  All of the dresses had 
a white bodice, even Michiru&#39;s, but each one faded to a different color 
skirt.  While Michiru&#39;s was light aqua blue with silver filigree wave 
designs, Usagi&#39;s was pale pink with gold roses along the hem, one blood 
red one with a long green stem on the front.  Rei&#39;s was crimson red with 
her favorite flowers, Casablancas, on the hem, white edged in gold.  
Minako&#39;s was orange with a golden chain around the hem, each link a 
perfect heart shape.  Usagi had been worried about letting Venus wear 
such an obvious symbol of her Senshi form, but the designers just 
thought it was because Minako resembled the Greek Goddess of love, so a 
chain of hearts was appropriate.  Ami&#39;s dress faded to dark blue, tiny 
dolphins leaping into the &quot;air&quot; from the hem, a design the water Senshi 
greatly admired.  Her designer specialized in sea creatures.  Makoto&#39;s 
dress turned dark green, silver and gold lightning bolts intertwined 
along the hem.
 
Ailan continued to consult with Michiru over the last of the lace on the 
hem and the designs she had created with the fragile material, her 
outgoing nature one of her best qualities as a designer.  Her customers 
were happier if she asked for their opinions.  Setsuna and Rei entered 
the room, unnoticed by the silver-haired designer and her flock of 
employees.  Haruka, her tuxedo finished, returned to the living room and 
stared at her fianc&eacute;e, who grinned at the constant chattering of the 
friendly woman crouching on the floor, all of her attention on the skirt 
in front of her.  Setsuna stared at the slender designer, knowing that 
she was young despite the striking color of her hair.  Her pale purple 
eyes and utter concentration reminded Setsuna of someone she knew long, 
long ago.
 
The designer stood to look at the finished dress, her back still to 
Setsuna.  &quot;Beautiful,&quot; Ailan whispered.  &quot;You look just like your mother 
on her wedding day.  She would be so proud of you, as gorgeous as you 
are.  Shou-chan was so pretty . . .&quot;
 
Setsuna gasped, hands flying to her mouth, dark red eyes wide in shock.  
The designer spun to face her, and the room stood still as both women 
stared.  Ailan&#39;s designers vanished into the den as Mamoru slipped into 
the living room, closing the door behind him.  &quot;Setsu-chan . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Serenity,&quot; Setsuna breathed, and the Senshi gasped.  &quot;It can&#39;t be you.&quot;
 
The silver-haired woman, tears streaking her cheeks, nodded, a golden 
crescent moon appearing in the center of her forehead.  &quot;You&#39;re not 
dreaming, my love.  I didn&#39;t know you would be here when I came.  I 
thought you were still at the gate,&quot; she whispered as the senshi moved 
closer.  Usagi, blue eyes wide, came to face the woman, a crescent moon 
on her forehead.
 
&quot;Mother?&quot;
 
Then she was in Ailan&#39;s arms, her memories of her mother filling her 
mind.  Ailan let her weak glamour fade, and everyone could see that she 
was their queen.  Eight Senshi and the Prince of Earth hit one knee, 
heads bowed, an automatic response barely remembered from their last 
life, and the last Queen of the Silver Millennium released her daughter.  
&quot;Do not bow to me.  I was the queen, but now that burden has passed to 
my daughter.  She is Serenity, I am no longer an owner of that name.&quot;  
She reached down and pulled Setsuna to her feet as the other senshi 
stood, unsure what they should do.  &quot;Now I can live the life I&#39;ve always 
wanted.  Not as Serenity, princess and then queen of the Moon Kingdom of 
the Silver Millennium, but as Hikarino Ailan, famous fashion designer.&quot;
 
&quot;A normal person.&quot;
 
Ailan nodded.  &quot;Yes.  Like you, like all of you senshi.  You&#39;re able to 
live the life denied you by Beryl&#39;s attack on my kingdom.&quot;  She looked 
at her daughter, now safe in Mamoru&#39;s arms, and she smiled.  &quot;Even 
Serenity and Endymion can be together here in this life on Earth.  And 
our errant young princesses.&quot;  She looked at all of the senshi, but 
Setsuna caught her chin and turned her back.  Touching her lover again 
after so many hundreds of years sent a shock through her, that small 
action convincing her more than anything that Serenity was alive.  This 
was the one person in the universe she loved, the one person she would 
obey without question, the woman for whom she would sacrifice 
everything.
 
&quot;Ailan,&quot; she whispered, trying out the new name.  &quot;Can we all be happy?&quot;  
The silver haired woman nodded, tears in her eyes, and Setsuna leaned 
forward far enough to let their lips touch.  Her world exploded in 
colors she had only seen in the Time Vortex, and she moaned.  Ailan 
deepened their kiss, fingers linking behind Setsuna&#39;s neck.  Setsuna 
used the hand resting on Ailan&#39;s waist to pull the slight woman closer, 
their bodies pressed together.  For the first time since they met her so 
long ago, the senshi watched as tears coursed down Setsuna&#39;s cheeks.  
Rei watched as the Senshi of Time cried for the third time in one day, 
and she wiped a tear off her cheek for the forbidden love.  She glanced 
at Usagi, wondering if she would ever know, but watching the former 
queen and her senshi she realized that it didn&#39;t matter.  Setsuna had a 
second chance, with her daughter and her lover, and she deserved to be 
happy.
 
Setsuna pulled away from Ailan, knowing that the woman that she held was 
the woman she had given her heart to millennia ago.  &quot;Did you know that 
we were here, that we had been reborn?&quot;
 
&quot;I knew the instant Luna turned Serenity&#151;Usagi, I mean&#151;into Sailor Moon; 
I knew the first time Mamoru became Tuxedo Kamen and swept my daughter 
out of harm&#39;s way; I knew what Minako was up to in England before there 
ever was a game or a control room in the Crown Arcade; I knew when Ami, 
Rei, and Makoto joined Sailor Moon; I knew when Michiru first dreamed of 
the Silence and transformed; I knew when she called her lover to be her 
partner in the fight; I knew when you came to Earth to help your Outer 
Partners; I knew when Saturn freed herself and eliminated Pharaoh 90 
with Sailor Moon&#39;s help; I knew when you died and I waited patiently for 
you to return to the mundane plane.  I knew when all of you died 
fighting Galaxia, and I cheered when my daughter&#39;s love freed Galaxia 
from chaos and brought you back.  I&#39;ve watched you since the beginning, 
beloved, but I no longer control the ginzuishou.  It belongs to Serenity 
now, so there was nothing I could do.  I thought it best never to meet 
you.&quot;
 
Setsuna nodded, her mind returning to the final battle, watching 
Serenity die in her arms again.  &quot;I know how hard it is to watch 
helplessly,&quot; she whispered.
 
Serenity/Ailan laid her head against Setsuna&#39;s breast, arms wrapped 
securely around her waist.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Setsu-chan.  I never wanted to 
make you watch us die.  But you had to live, you had to keep the spirit 
of the Silver Millennium alive and protect the Earth from intruders it 
could not fight.  The prophecies said that if all the princesses took 
their stones and woke their planets, Time must not stop.  I didn&#39;t tell 
you in case it made you more determined to die with the other senshi.  
We all made our sacrifices, Setsuna.&quot;
 
Usagi cleared her throat.  &quot;Um, Mother?  Why are you here now?&quot;
 
Ailan grinned.  &quot;I never intended that you should discover my true 
identity.  As a matter of fact, only Setsuna would be able to see 
through my glamour, but I had no idea that she would be living with the 
other Outer Senshi, mother to Hotaru.  Though, perhaps I should have 
considered that possibility.&quot;  She glanced at Setsuna, returning her 
attention to her daughter as she laughed lightly and waved a hand at 
Michiru and Haruka, who had joined her finac&eacute;e.  &quot;This time I will not 
miss their wedding.&quot;  Beside her, Setsuna also laughed, quite possibly 
for the first time in centuries, at least since Queen Serenity died.  
&quot;You do look like Shousha, Michiru-san.&quot;
 
&quot;She doesn&#39;t remember her mother, Ailan.&quot;
 
Ailan glanced up at the former Queen of Pluto, knowing instantly who was 
suppressing the senshi&#39;s memories.  &quot;Setsuna!  Why haven&#39;t you returned 
their memories to them?&quot;
 
Setsuna stepped back, eyes sad, as all of her loneliness and depression 
from the past centuries came crashing down on her, even worse than 
usual, worse even than thinking about losing her daughter, as the Garnet 
Rod appeared in her hand.  &quot;Some things are better left dead,&quot; she 
whispered, her voice full of a pain no one had yet to heal.  Clenching 
her fingers around the staff, the Senshi of Time vanished as she 
instantly transformed into Sailor Pluto.
 
&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot;  With a sudden burst of whatever power she still had 
leftover from the Silver Millennium, Ailan jumped through the closing 
portal, vanishing with her lover.
 
Silence.
 
A silence so still that Pluto&#39;s Time Stop might not rival it.
 
A silence more profound than Saturn&#39;s ultimate power, Death Reborn 
Revolution.
 
And just as quickly, the Senshi seemed to catch their breaths and their 
wits.  Rei was the first to break the silence, many of the revelations 
in the past minutes no surprise to her.  &quot;Poor Setsuna-san,&quot; she 
whispered.  &quot;At least she was used to loneliness. What if Ailan goes 
away?  I don&#39;t think Setsuna-san could survive another heartbreak like 
that.&quot;
 
&quot;I didn&#39;t know Setsuna-san and my mother . . .&quot;  Usagi blushed, thinking 
about it, and Mamoru laughed at her uneasiness.
 
&quot;What, did you think there were only four lesbians in the Silver 
Millennium?&quot;
 
Haruka laughed at the suggestion, pulling Michiru into her arms.  &quot;At 
least Setsuna-san has taste.  After all, the Queen of the Moon?&quot;
 
Michiru elbowed her lover.  &quot;Have some respect, Haruka!  This is a very 
difficult time for them.&quot;
 
&quot;And I always felt sorry for Setsuna, being the loneliest senshi,&quot; 
Minako laughed.  &quot;I wonder what their story is.&quot;
 
&quot;She is lonely,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;She had to watch the woman she loved 
die, and I think she&#39;s in shock.  She never expected to see Serenity 
alive.  She&#39;ll be okay.&quot;  I hope.</pre>
