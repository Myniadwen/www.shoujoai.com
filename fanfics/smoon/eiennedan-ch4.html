<a href="../smoon/eiennedan-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Hotaru? Hotaru? Are you alright?&quot; 

The words echoed strangely. Hotaru blinked, wondering who asked, this 
time. So many people, so many places, so many times, always the same 
question.... 

&quot;Saturn - are you okay?&quot; 

The words bounced around her, almost palpably. She could see a man, 
with pale hair and glasses, his eyes full of pain, looking into her 
face. His face metamorphosed into a young, female face, pink eyes 
large and full of tears. Once again the face shifted. Tan skin framed 
large red eyes, surrounded by long green hair. It altered again, this 
time black eyes full of envy and hate burned into her own. Red hair 
whipped around the face and the figure laughed. Hotaru turned away, 
only to find herself looking into her own face, also laughing, an 
unpleasant, cold sound. She could see her own eyes filled with an 
alien madness, her own body changing, aging, her hair growing&#133;Hotaru 
began to scream, but could not move, or look away. Dark violet eyes 
sucked her in; she felt as if she would drown, until a warm touch 
shocked her awake. 

Or so she thought. Hotaru looked around and could see nothing. In 
still blackness she lay, with no idea of where she was. A small violet 
light burned in front of her and she blinked, not sure she really saw 
it. The symbol of Saturn burned its way through the blackness and 
settled on her forehead. Once again she blinked, only to see herself 
as Sailor Saturn, standing before her. 

Sailor Saturn took Hotaru&#39;s hands in her own. Hotaru could feel the 
strength coming from them. She shivered as the warmth entered her 
body, filling it with energy. 

&quot;This is the last time you will ever have to see me.&quot; Saturn spoke. 
Hotaru blinked at tears that threatened to spill from her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry - every time I&#39;ve come to awaken you, I&#39;ve brought you pain. But 
this is the last time.&quot; Saturn reached out and touched Hotaru&#39;s 
forehead, where the Saturn symbol blazed brightly. &quot;You will never be 
not whole again.&quot; 

Hotaru cried out and fell back, her body shining with a purple light. 
Saturn began to fade, as Hotaru drew the last of her energy into 
herself. The light around Hotaru grew stronger, as Saturn disappeared. 
With a final flash, Saturn emptied herself into Hotaru and became one, 
at last, with herself. 

Hotaru! Please answer me!&quot; 

The voice was familiar, but she could not place it. There had been so 
many people asking that of her whole life. Was she, in fact, alright? 
She could not have answered even if she had a voice. She did not know 
if she would ever be alright. 

There was a time, long ago, when she had been, she was sure. Her 
mother had held her close, her father had been there for her. She was 
convinced that she had been alright then. But then Mother had gone and 
then Father... Father sold his soul and hers to save her life. Then 
she had been most definitely not alright. At best she had been weak 
and isolated. At worst, she was a danger to those around her. 

Hotaru-chan? Are you alright?&quot; 

Hotaru thought of the faces that had looked at her this afternoon. All 
loving, caring faces. She could feel her throat tighten with the 
memory. After all those years of solitude, she was surrounded by more 
love than she knew how to handle. After years of segregation from her 
peers and classmates, after a life of emptiness, all that love&#133; 

Hotaru felt the tears fall down her face, but she could not move to 
wipe them away. She had no body, apparently, floating in this 
all-encompassing darkness. 

&quot;Saturn, please answer us!&quot; 

She knew those voices. Once upon a time they had been comrades, 
compatriots that had not known her at all. Now they were family. She 
knew those voices, and took comfort from them, even though she could 
not answer. 

Hotaru let her eyes close. There was no reason to keep them open, 
nothing to see. She could feel the voices reaching out to her from a 
great distance and she reached out with her mind, speaking quietly 
inside her head. &quot;I&#39;m here. I&#39;m fine.&quot; 

The voices stopped abruptly and Hotaru flinched with the shock of 
their loss. Her eyes opened reflexively and she found herself in a 
soft bed, surrounded by curtains swaying softly in the wind. 

Under the silken sheets she was naked. Hotaru sat up, clutching the 
blanket around her and looked around the room. A breeze blew through 
the room, scented with a flower she could not place. A soft sound 
repeated regularly was the only noise she could hear. She focused on 
the sound, turning to her right. 

Sitting on a stool was a tall woman, smoothly brushing out long, 
auburn hair. The sound was that of the brush moving in slow even 
motions. Even as she watched the woman, Hotaru longed to touch that 
hair, breath in its scent. 

&quot;So, you&#39;ve come back at last.&quot; The woman&#39;s voice was musical, 
entrancing. It took Hotaru a moment to recognize that she had been 
spoken to. 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s been a very long time, Saturn. You haven&#39;t visited me for 
centuries. An entire millennium, in fact. Or,&quot; the woman turned to 
face Hotaru, &quot;should I call you Hotaru now?&quot; 

Hotaru searched the face for some sign of sarcasm, but she could not 
find any. Hotaru shrugged with indifference. 

&quot;Whatever you like. Shall I still call you Eternity?&quot; 

Eternity smiled, but the smile did not reach her eyes. Her eyes were 
not human, and they burned with an intense need. Hotaru wrenched her 
eyes away from Eternity&#39;s gaze, looking down at her hands. 

&quot;Have I become ugly then?&quot; The woman began to braid her hair in an 
intricate pattern. Silence fell in the room. &quot;You won&#39;t look at me?&quot; 
She stopped moving and waited for Hotaru to lift her eyes. 

Violet eyes met amber ones. Eternity began braiding her hair again. 
Strands moved neatly in between one another, flickering with a red 
flame in the light. 

&quot;Why am I here?&quot; Hotaru asked plainly. Eternity winced and her face 
grew pale with anger. 

&quot;Have you forgotten what you owe me?&quot; Eternity&#39;s eyes flashed with 
rage. &quot;Have you forgotten how I found you floating, nearly lifeless, 
an empty shell - how I took you in, healed you, loved you and gave you 
life? Is that worth nothing to you?&quot; Her voice was still soft, but it 
had grown cold. 

Hotaru&#39;s expression did not change. &quot;That was, as you say, a long time 
ago. Haven&#39;t I paid you enough since then?&quot; She thought of the price 
she had been paying for over a millennia to this entity. 

&quot;You brought it on yourself. You gave up all your power to Queen 
Serenity in your noble cause. All you wanted was to redeem yourself, 
to be more than the Senshi of destruction.&quot; Eternity laughed harshly. 
&quot;What hubris! To think of yourself as a god, a being of infinite power 
who can grant life&#133;&quot; 

Hotaru&#39;s eyes were hot, but no tears came. 

Eternity continued to taunt her. &quot;And when you had emptied yourself of 
all your pretensions, and chosen death for yourself as the alternative 
to eternally bringing death to others, where was your Monarch? Dead 
among the ruins of her own dreams! How noble you both were!&quot; 

&quot;I found you drifting, I took you in.&quot; Eternity&#39;s voice changed, 
softening. &quot;It is, after all, what I do. But you were so frail, an 
almost empty body. Only a spark of life was left in you.&quot; She finished 
binding her hair and rose, walking over to the bed. Her gown flowed 
over the floor, as amber as her eyes. Hotaru did not move when 
Eternity put one hand to her cheek. 

&quot;I loved you then. I nursed you, giving you my energy, something that 
I had never done before and have never done since. And I brought you 
new life. And&#133;&quot; Eternity&#39;s voice faltered, &quot;You loved me.&quot; She drew 
close to Hotaru and laid her lips gently on Hotaru&#39;s own. 

Even if Hotaru wanted to, she would not have been able to resist the 
gentle pressure of those lips. And she did not want to. So much of 
what she was, of her very essence, she owed to this woman. Entity, she 
corrected herself. 

The kiss was long, and sweet. Hotaru found herself floating once again 
in darkness, but this time she was not alone. Another being wrapped 
itself around her, absorbed her, filling her with passion. 

Eternity pulled away slowly. &quot;Is the price I ask so much that you will 
not pay me? Isn&#39;t it enough that you owe me your life?&quot; Her eyes were 
embers that burned into Hotaru&#39;s mind. 

&quot;Hotaru-chan!&quot; 

&quot;Hotaru!&quot; 

&quot;Saturn!&quot; 

The voices were back, insistent. Hotaru stared into Eternity&#39;s eyes. 
Eternity&#39;s face melted into a glowing ball of nothingness, a blackness 
that dragged at the very existence of light. Energy was crushed, 
melded and absorbed, time slowed and was distorted in the nexus 
created by Eternity. 

Hotaru shuddered and pushed Eternity away. &quot;You don&#39;t love me, you 
can&#39;t. You don&#39;t know what love is, your very being is about engulfing 
and swallowing - you&#39;re not human!&quot; Hotaru jumped out of the bed, 
sheets falling to her ankles. Naked, she stood for a moment, then 
lifted one arm. &quot;Saturn Planet Power Make Up!&quot; In a moment Sailor 
Saturn confronted the now enraged Eternity. 

Eternity hissed as the Glaive came forward, just touching her neck. 
Her eyes flashed as she spoke, her voice triumphant. &quot;This toy can&#39;t 
stop me, I am eternal - I am Eternity.&quot; She knocked the Glaive away 
with a sneer. &quot;You owe me Saturn. We had a deal and this, &quot; she waved 
her hand at Hotaru&#39;s form, &quot;this comes with a price.&quot; She began to 
laugh cruelly and Hotaru stepped backwards, into nothingness. She 
began to fall&#133;. 

Hotaru lurched forward into waiting arms, sweat pouring off of her. 
This was the dream she had had the night before, only this time, she 
remembered everything. Face in her hands, Hotaru cried silently, while 
gentle hands and voices soothed her. 

She remembered, not just her previous life as the daughter of Tomoe 
Souichi, but as Saturn, guardian of the Outer Solar System, and 
bringer of destruction. What a horrible burden that had been - to know 
she would only bring death to those around her. 

She remembered her visit to Pluto, how she had brought solace, and 
replaced visions of death with those of love. It was that single event 
that had triggered, literally, lifetimes of pain. For when she left 
Pluto, Saturn had vowed never to bring destruction without renewed 
life again. Even as she warned Pluto against herself, Saturn had sworn 
she would redeem herself and bring life to her Solar System. 

She had, in a small way. When she found Queen Serenity and the Inner 
Senshi all dying, all attempting to protect their Princess, Saturn 
knew that she had found her moment of redemption. With her last bit of 
life-force, Queen Serenity and Saturn had created enough energy to 
save the Princess and her court and send them through time. Although 
she would die herself, Saturn felt that this was worth her own life, 
and more. 

But Saturn hadn&#39;t died. Some small spark, the same spark perhaps that 
had preserved Hotaru from being destroyed by Mistress 9, had remained. 
She had no awareness, no mind, only a barely living body, drifting 
free in the cosmic winds. 

It was there that she had been drawn in by the tides of Eternity. 
Eternity lived at the center of the galaxy, in the form of a black 
hole, forever swallowing energy - a cosmic Charybdis that absorbed 
everything and gave back nothing. Eternity had drawn her in, but had 
not absorbed her. 

Time has no meaning to the dead, nor does it exist in the center of a 
black hole. She had stayed with Eternity for a long time, first as a 
patient, then as she healed, as a lover. Eternity gave her everything, 
even taking on a human form to please her. 

But Saturn was haunted by the fate of her home, her Solar System. She 
asked Eternity to free her...and Eternity had. But there had been a 
price. A dreadful price and one she had been paying for far too long. 

And here she was, at last, with a family and friends and a human life 
to be lived. A chance for happiness. No, Hotaru told herself, no 
chance for happiness. Just a cycle of life and death to be reborn over 
and over, to bring destruction and life and to begin again. She 
dropped her head to her knees, dragged down by the weight of her 
hopelessness. 

Three figures surrounded Hotaru, holding her close. Above her head, 
three pairs of eyes met with firm resolve. If they had any say in the 
matter, Saturn would not die again. Around them, grave faces showed 
resolute agreement. 

------------------------------------------------------------

The courtyard of Hikawa Shrine was filled with the echoing cries from 
the crows above. Eleven figures stood in silence, contemplating their 
plight. 

Hotaru watched as Chibi-Usa clenched her fists and readied herself for 
a final assault. &quot;I have to go - you can&#39;t leave me behind. 
Hotaru-chan is my best friend...&quot; She clasped one of Hotaru&#39;s hands 
tightly and planted her feet solidly beneath her, as if expecting to 
be dragged off. She looked up at Hotaru, who now stood a good head and 
shoulders above her. Hotaru wondered again at the unfairness of the 
universe. 900 years was a long time to be a child, and here I am, 
aging too fast. How terribly unfair. 

No one moved to stop Chibi-Usa, no one moved at all. At last Mamoru 
stood up and walked forward, holding out one hand. 

&quot;Chibi-Usa-chan, we need you to stay here, to stay safe.&quot; He took her 
free hand in his and kneeled down to speak to her. 

&quot;It&#39;s not fair...&quot; she began, but he interrupted her. &quot;Chibi-Usa-chan, 
Small Lady, we don&#39;t know what will happen right now, but you need to 
be safe, in case...&quot; he stopped and looked at Usagi, who nodded, &quot;in 
case we don&#39;t come back.&quot; 

Chibi-Usa looked at him for a moment, and then his meaning struck her. 
She shrank back from him and clung to Hotaru. &quot;No! I don&#39;t care. If 
you go, I want to go too!&quot; she looked at Hotaru, avoiding Usagi&#39;s 
eyes. Hotaru could see that Usagi was trying hard not to cry. 

Usagi stepped next to Mamoru and drew Chibi-Usa&#39;s attention. &quot;If you 
want to be treated as an adult, Chibi-Usa-chan, you have to face up to 
adult responsibilities.&quot; 

Hotaru looked down at her friend and smiled. &quot;Chibi-Usa-chan, I&#39;d like 
for you to wait for me, then I know I&#39;ll have a reason to return.&quot; Her 
voice was tight, but her smile was honest and open. 

Chibi-Usa looked away, but none of the others would meet her eyes, 
except Setsuna, who stood at a distance. 

&quot;Pu?&quot; she asked, weakly. 

Setsuna shook her head. &quot;I agree with the Prince and Princess, Small 
Lady. Stay here and stay safe.&quot; 

Chibi-Usa bowed her head in defeat. Hotaru leaned close to her and 
gave the smaller girl a hug. &quot;Chibi-Usa-chan, I&#39;m serious - be here 
when I get back, or I&#39;ll be very angry.&quot; 

Chibi-Usa&#39;s face darkened. &quot;Then you had better come back, or I&#39;ll be 
even angrier!&quot; She turned away, so no one would see her cry. Hotaru 
thought of her friend, and of how proud the girl was. She has 
something I never had, a root, a base, it gives her so much strength 
and pride. 

Time was running short, Hotaru knew. She could feel the pull that 
Eternity now exerted upon her. Twice in the past week shadow forms had 
attacked the Senshi and both times were defeated without Sailor 
Saturn. But the call to return to Eternity was getting stronger. She 
was pulling at Hotaru, drawing her in, trying to take back the energy 
she had once given her. Hotaru could feel the drain even as she stood 
here in the shrine. Eternity was very far away, and still had the 
ability to pull her back. 

&quot;Are we ready to go?&quot; Mamoru&#39;s voice was clear and strong. Usagi stood 
next to him, holding his hand. She hesitated, then spoke. 
&quot;Mamo-chan...maybe you had better stay behind too...&quot; her voice 
petered out weakly, not sure of her position. She cleared her throat, 
avoiding the look of astonishment in Mamoru&#39;s face. &quot;This way,&quot; she 
floundered, &quot;this way, I have a reason to come back, too.&quot; 

Mamoru opened his mouth to argue, but at that moment Ami looked up 
from her computer. &quot;I&#39;ve got it! I&#39;ve figured out a way to anchor us 
here, and provide a beacon to bring us back, but there&#39;s a small 
problem...&quot; She looked at Makoto and Rei, who stood at her side. &quot;One 
of us is going to have to stay here and provide a signal for us to 
latch on to.&quot; 

Rei opened her mouth and shut it again, clenching her jaw. Ami 
continued. &quot;I&#39;d say that it should be me, since my powers are the 
weakest, but I need to be with Sailor Moon and Saturn to guide them. 
Unless one of you wants to learn the calculations...&quot; Everyone 
demurred hastily. 

&quot;I&#39;ll stay.&quot; Minako declared with finality. &quot;My powers aren&#39;t as 
strong as Haruka-san&#39;s and Michiru-san&#39;s or Mako-chan&#39;s or Rei-chan&#39;s. 
I can stay here.&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; Mamoru stepped up and touched Minako lightly on the shoulder. 
&quot;No - she is your Princess, you have a job to protect her and to lead 
the Senshi . You go.&quot; He turned to Usagi and smiled wanly. &quot;I guess I 
will be staying behind with Chibi-Usa-chan, after all.&quot; Chibi-Usa 
hugged herself to him, and buried her face in his arm. 

Everyone turned away, talking softly in small groups, as Usagi, 
Chibi-Usa and Mamoru said their farewells. In a few moments, Usagi, 
with her eyes shining and wet, stepped forward and lifted her arm to 
the sky. One at a time, each of the Senshi did likewise, until all 
stood transformed, in a circle. 

Mamoru and Chibi-Usa stood back and Sailor Mercury made a few last 
minute calculations. &quot;I&#39;ve programmed the computer to lock onto your 
life signs as a guide. It would probably be a good idea if you waited 
here for us.&quot; Mamoru nodded and lifted one hand in farewell. As each 
Senshi clasped hands, a wind arose, lifting their hair, a wash of 
color and light surrounded each woman. Sailor Saturn stood at Sailor 
Moon&#39;s side and looked once around the circle. When her eyes reached 
Sailor Mercury she paused, meeting Mercury&#39;s clear gaze. 

&quot;Can you lead us there?&quot; Sailor Mercury asked. 

Sailor Saturn nodded. &quot;I have to go anyway. She&#39;s calling me.&quot; Sailor 
Saturn felt a pressure in her hand. Sailor Moon had tightened her grip 
on Saturn&#39;s hand. 

They all focused their power into a Sailor Teleport and Sailor Saturn 
felt the unmistakable sensation of Time and Space opening up to let 
them through. She focused her mind on the tug she was feeling. 

In a moment, all the Sailors were gone. Chibi-Usa stood next to 
Mamoru, both of them refusing to cry, not ready to speak. The wind 
died down and the birdsong picked up again. For a long while the two 
figures stood, looking out into the sky and thinking of the people 
that had just left. 

Finally Mamoru looked down at Chibi-Usa. &quot;C&#39;mon. Let&#39;s go see if we 
can help Rei&#39;s grandfather with any chores.&quot; he said softly. And 
without another word, the two figures turned and headed into the 
Temple. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Hotaru let the lure she felt draw her, not terribly gently, through 
the hole that opened for them. She could sense other planets and stars 
slipping away near them, but she did not let herself become 
distracted. Out there was a being that wanted to take her life away. 
And she, just as strongly, wanted it back. 

The Senshi felt themselves slowing, and finally landing, if landing it 
could be called. Hotaru looked around. She did not recognize where she 
was, but this was not surprising. Eternity had created a false world 
within the black hole during their time together. This place looked 
more like the nothingness that truly existed. Sailor Mercury hit a few 
keys on her computer and reported that their space-time bubble 
remained strong. She glanced at Sailor Pluto for confirmation. 

Sailor Pluto nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll be able to tell if there is any stress on 
the field that may affect us. Nonetheless, it would be better if we 
remained together.&quot; 

They all agreed. Sailor Mercury looked up from her computer and 
summoned her visor. She registered the visor&#39;s scans and shook her 
head. &quot;I&#39;m not getting any useful readings right now. It&#39;s like we 
aren&#39;t anywhere.&quot; 

Sailor Saturn nodded. &quot;That&#39;s exactly where we are - nowhere. I can 
feel her, though, pulling at me.&quot; She turned around and faced into the 
blackness. &quot;There - Eternity is there....&quot; She fell silent for a 
moment. 

&quot;Saturn, what do you hear?&quot; Sailor Neptune&#39;s voice was soft, 
reassuring. 

&quot;She&#39;s there, and she&#39;s taunting me, tugging at me.&quot; Sailor Saturn 
said grimly. 

Sailor Jupiter clenched her fist. &quot;She&#39;s got a lot of nerve doing 
that. Let&#39;s go make her regret her poor manners.&quot; 

&quot;Right!&quot; Sailor Mars agreed. &quot;She hasn&#39;t even sent us a welcoming 
committee.&quot; 

Sailor Venus looked around a little nervously. &quot;I feel like we&#39;re 
being watched, though. Can&#39;t you feel it?&quot; 

&quot;There definitely is a weird feeling in this place, but I can&#39;t place 
it. More like there&#39;s *no* feeling here...&quot; Sailor Mars commented 

Sailor Neptune agreed, holding up a blank mirror. &quot;My mirror doesn&#39;t 
reveal anything at all.&quot; 

Sailor Saturn was still staring off into the distance. &quot;She is 
watching...&quot; Sailors Jupiter and Mars stepped up to Saturn and stood 
by her side. 

&quot;Lead on Saturn - we&#39;ll show her what we think of people that attack 
one of us.&quot; Jupiter was actually beginning to look forward to this 
fight. 

Sailor Saturn gripped her Glaive and looked towards Sailor Moon, who 
had said nothing at all. 

Sailor Moon gestured a bit vaguely. &quot;I agree, we are being watched, 
but what can we do? Let&#39;s find Eternity as soon as possible and get 
out of here.&quot; 

In rows of three, the Senshi moved forward in the darkness. The 
nothingness was disconcerting. It was not a blinding darkness, but 
neither were there landmarks or light sources of any kind. Just a 
blankness, with no sense of reality at all. 

Venus, who walked with Sailors Neptune and Pluto, shrank a bit, as the 
&quot;wall&quot; closed in on her. She stood still for a moment, to let the two 
older women pass. The &quot;wall&quot; behind her had no sensation, except 
hardness, to it. It was neither warm nor cold. It felt like nothing at 
all. She tried not to cringe as her arm brushed it. Back to the wall, 
Venus waited one more moment, then stepped away to join her friends. 
She was unable to move - her legs had been grabbed by the wall, and 
hands of black nothingness now gripped her arms tightly. Right before 
her mouth was covered, she managed to shriek out, &quot;The wall...&quot; And 
the null hand that covered her face absorbed the rest of the yell. 

The rest of the Senshi heard Venus&#39; cry and its abrupt cessation and 
immediately formed a circular formation, with Sailor Moon in the 
center. Sailor Venus continued to struggle, but inexorably, she was 
being absorbed into the wall. Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Uranus leapt 
forward and began to pull her back towards them, but nothing budged 
the darkness&#39; grip on her. Sailor Uranus lifted her arm to throw World 
Shaking, but Sailor Moon cried out. 

&quot;Don&#39;t, Haruka-san! You&#39;ll hurt Minako-chan!&quot; Sailor Moon covered her 
mouth in horror as Sailor Venus&#39; legs completely disappeared into the 
void of the wall. 

&quot;We can&#39;t just do nothing!&quot; Jupiter ground her teeth. &quot;Sparkling Wide 
Pressure!&quot; and she slammed her hand into the wall about 2 feet to 
Venus&#39;s left. Her attack rippled through the nullity that sucked at 
Sailor Venus, causing it to distort and crack. With a sickening noise, 
Sailor Venus pulled one leg away from the wall and managed to free her 
head from the darkness. 

&quot;Again&#133;&quot; she gasped, and then the void reached out again for her. 

Sailor Uranus slammed her hand into the wall on Venus&#39;s right. &quot;World 
Shaking!&quot; Sailor Jupiter again attacked the wall with Supreme Thunder. 
With a wrench, Sailor Venus pulled herself free from the confines of 
the wall. It immediately subsided into a featureless blackness. 

&quot;I think we have met our welcoming committee.&quot; Rei commented dryly. 

Sailor Venus assured them that she was fine, but secretly felt as if 
it was all she could do not to collapse. I swear, she thought, that I 
will never be comfortable in confined places again&#133; 

&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; Sailor Mars spoke again. &quot;We could move around 
forever here and never do anything but walk in circles.&quot; She looked at 
Sailor Mercury, who shrugged. 

&quot;I certainly can&#39;t get any readings here&#133;&quot; Mercury said, shaking her 
head. 

&quot;We need a better plan than this!&quot; Mars continued. &quot;we can&#39;t just walk 
into what is obviously a trap.&quot; 

Sailor Saturn turned to face her. &quot;You are right. You should stay 
here..&quot; 

&quot;What?!&quot; Sailor Jupiter held a seething Sailor Mars from leaping on 
Saturn. &quot;I&#39;m not staying here while you all move on!&quot; 

Saturn shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t mean you - I mean all of you. I&#39;m the 
only one really in danger here.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s not true, Saturn.&quot; Sailor Moon said seriously. &quot;Didn&#39;t you say 
that Eternity wanted all of our energies now? Then we&#39;re all in 
danger, not just you. We all go on.&quot; 

Sailor Mars turned towards Saturn with a dazed look. &quot;She makes sense. 
We can&#39;t leave you alone anyway. Just lead us on, I guess.&quot; Saturn 
nodded and turned away. 

They moved silently into the blankness, not even their footfalls 
making a noise. 

&quot;This is utterly creepy,&quot; Sailor Jupiter commented. &quot;We know they&#39;re 
watching - and they can attack at any time. I don&#39;t like it.&quot; 

&quot;I agree.&quot; Sailor Uranus was not happy at all. Sailor Saturn wasn&#39;t 
usually this placid. She was too passive by half. &quot;I feel like we are 
sheep being lead to the slaughter&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Uranus, that was not the best simile you&#39;ve ever chosen.&quot; Sailor 
Neptune&#39;s voice was mildly scolding. Sailor Uranus grimaced. 

&quot;Is it just me, &quot;Sailor Mercury commented, or does it seem hot in 
here?&quot; She looked to Sailor Pluto, who stood as if listening. 

&quot;Immense pressure is being placed on our space-time bubble.&quot; Pluto 
confirmed. 

&quot;What exactly does that mean?&quot; Sailor Moon looked less than regal at 
the moment. 

&quot;It means, that if they shatter it, the forces in the black hole will 
rip us to shreds.&quot; Sailor Saturn answered. 

&quot;Hunh,&quot; Sailor Mars grunted, &quot;And you all think *I&#39;m* grim.&quot; 

The tension lessened, but the heat didn&#39;t. The general air of 
oppression grew, along with a germ of fear in each Senshi. Which would 
give out first, the space-time bubble or their nerves? 

Their pace had slowed as the feeling of being squeezed grew, until 
they barely plodded along. Sailor Saturn still led them, but her eyes 
were cast down and her whole bearing spoke of defeat. Sailor Moon 
couldn&#39;t bear to look at her. She was just about to lose her 
composure, when the blackness that surrounded them broke apart. 

With a explosive noise, the blankness shattered into a thousand 
shards, each full of unnatural angles. Figures stood in the shards, 
black and distorted, shadow puppets as seen through warped glass. 

The shadow creatures surrounded the Senshi, moving too quickly for a 
plan of attack to be formed. Sailor Mars found her Flame Bow leaping 
to her hands and she readied herself, taking aim on one of the 
creatures. She could see Sailor Venus raise one hand and Sailor 
Mercury gather her arms together. Together they might just be strong 
enough. She drew a breath in, centered herself and... 

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Sailor Saturn&#39;s voice broke through her concentration. &quot;This 
is exactly what Eternity wants. She wants to drain us all of our 
power.&quot; 

&quot;Are we simply supposed to stand here and be overwhelmed?&quot; Sailor 
Uranus lowered her hand, but her fist was clenched. 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Sailor Moon looked terrified, but her voice was strong. &quot;I want 
to meet Eternity.&quot; No one said a word. All of the Senshi turned and 
faced their leader, closing ranks, and holding hands once more. No 
words were spoken, no protest raised. Eyes closed, they allowed the 
awaiting darkness to wash over them, a foul wave of nothingness that 
consumed them, leaving nothing but the thick, blank void.
