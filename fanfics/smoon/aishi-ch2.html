&quot;Uhn...&quot; Minako awoke, her arms wrapped around Rei in a passionate 
embrace. She looked downward at the slender girl in her arms, and 
smiled grimly to herself. The fiery angel&#39;s ebony hair was a mess of 
sweat and tangles, and her heavy black lashes rested comfortably upon 
her pale ivory cheeks. The crimson, rose-petal lips that belonged to 
none other than the miko were slightly parted, pearly teeth 
semi-showing. Oh, how Minako wanted to look at her face forever!

A solitary tear traveled down Minako&#39;s cheek as she realized what this 
one night meant, how much it would mean to Rei once she awoke.

&#39;Do I really love her this much...or is this just a one night thing? 
Does she really love me? If she does...can we really pull this off?&#39; 
These questions replayed inside Minako&#39;s head until the entire world in 
her eyes was spinning with stress. She blinked her azure eyes once, and 
everything straightened itself out before her. 

&quot;Hai, I love her.&quot; She answered one of her queries in a whisper, 
expecting thunder to strike or Satan to pick her up and throw her into 
Hell or Rei to awaken or...something. Love for another woman 
was...unheard of in her family. &quot;Wait &#39;till Mom finds out.&quot; She 
muttered to herself, a vision of her waiflike, angelic mother crying on 
their living room floor popping into her mind. 

She was certain her father would be even worse, what with all the 
stress that had been piling upon him due to his job and the fact that 
her younger sister&#39;s rebellious nature had her moving out of their 
house. He&#39;d probably disown her, for sure!

Minako realized one thing; one important thing that would probably 
break Rei&#39;s heart forever. She had to leave, and never come back.

Slowly, she untangled her arms from around Rei&#39;s slim form and peeled 
back the damp sheet that had somehow wound itself around their 
sweat-drenched figures. Settling her feet on the carpet and facing the 
cold air without her lover&#39;s body next to her, she breathed a sigh of 
sorrow and slipped on one of Rei&#39;s terrycloth robes. 

Walking over to the desk next to the bed, Minako began her letter.

Rei~

I am truly sorry for my unwelcome departure, but I don&#39;t know what to 
think anymore. In true Romeo and Juliet style, our loves are forbidden, 
and I don&#39;t think we should do this. Although we&#39;ve spent our first 
night together, and I now know how I truly feel about you, this cannot 
happen. Chibi-Usa never mentioned us being together in Crystal Tokyo, 
and therefore we obviously aren&#39;t meant for one another. We should 
forget this illicit night, and move on with our lives. 

As much as I love you, This can&#39;t be. I hope you understand my actions.

Aishiteru, Rei-chan
Minako.

She stopped, pen hovering over the scrap of stationary, feeling she 
should write something more. She couldn&#39;t think of anything. Another 
tear rolled down her cheek, meeting her tongue. The salty flavor 
illuminated her senses, and she looked over towards the bed, where her 
fiery angel slept onward, unaware of what Minako was about to do. It 
was then she looked back towards the desk, and noticed it.

A single scrap of the very same flame-bordered stationary laid upon a 
pile of tarot cards, and it had the name &#39;Minako&#39; written upon it in 
Rei&#39;s best cursive. 

Thinking that it held some meaning, but too muddled to think of it, she 
tiptoed over to her backpack and slipped the paper inside, at the same 
time pulling out a clean college uniform. It was Monday, after all. 

Minako hurriedly changed unto the uniform, and, placing her trademark 
red hairbow in it&#39;s place, she once again watched as Rei stirred gently 
in her sleep. She held her breath, praying that the ebony-haired woman 
didn&#39;t awaken.

She didn&#39;t, but it took a few minutes for Minako to feel safe enough to 
move again.

After a few more moments of primping and fussing, the blonde walked to 
the bed, left her note next to Rei&#39;s delicate face, climbed out of the 
window, and vanished into the starry night.


A/N: So, how&#39;d you like Chapter Two? Only 2&frac12; pages long, but I assure 
you the next chapter will be MUCH longer!!!
