<a href="../smoon/sailergg-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	Haruka opened the hood to the car then rested her hands at her hips as
she regarded the engine. Inhaled the odour of oil and exhaust that rose against
her while her mind minced the seeds of her knowledge. Something was up with the
carburettor, she had worked many hours trying to figure it out but had made no
progress. &quot;So what do you think?&quot; She asked and looked down at her belly. &quot;I
don&#39;t have a clue so I thought you could help me.&quot; She leaned against the car
and smiled while she investigated the engine closer. &quot;We have cleaned the
carburettor and made sure that air can enter freely, so it probably something
with the fuel injection.&quot; She angled her head to look at the spot where the
carburettor had been seated. &quot;Probably some filter that is clogged.&quot; She reached
in and trapped the fuel hose between two fingers, traced it down feeling the
thick oil stick to her fingers. &quot;You mother don&#39;t like when its dirty, don&#39;t
like being down here when I&#39;m working on the cars.&quot; Haruka released a exert
exhale as she reached deeper into the car. &quot;But that is a good thing.&quot; Her
fingers tripped over a oddity on the hose and she investigated it with her
fingernails. &quot;We don&#39;t want her running down her when we work on the cars.&quot; Her
fingers left the hose with a verdict. &quot;The hose is broken.&quot; She smelled her
fingers and the fumes of gasoline penetrated her sense of smell. Haruka crouched
down and looked under the car. &quot;We need some place to be alone, to talk about
stuff.&quot; She smiled as her knees touched the concrete floor. &quot;And you could crawl
under the cars, I am a little to pregnant to do that.&quot; She saw a small puddle of
what she guessed was gasoline and sighed. &quot;I have found the fault.&quot; She said and
rose to her full length a little to fast and a dizziness came to her head so she
leaned against the car and closed her eyes.

Chapter 2: Leakage.

	&quot;We have to get a new hose.&quot; Haruka said and opened her eyes releasing a
disappointed smile to traverse her lips. &quot;But I think that will have to wait.&quot;
She removed a piece of cloth from her pocket and dried her fingers as she walked
over to her workbench and sat down on her chair and from there regarded the car.
Her face had been graced by a thin veil of sweat and she was fatigued by the
labour of carrying a child. &quot;At least we have something to do after your are
born.&quot; She rested both hands on her shirt and felt her belly below, inside her a
sense of pride grew to enveloped her mind and left her sitting there thinking
about Michiru. &quot;I like your mother very much and I know she likes me just as
much.&quot; She rested her hands at the peak of her belly. &quot;It&#39;s with that love that
we embrace you.&quot; In a squall of emotions tears came to her eyes joined by a
smile as motherly as she could produce. Haruka rose from the chair and began to
make her way towards the stairs. Scaled them with some effort and arrived in the
hallway. A cold breeze came towards her from a open window somewhere, she made a
stroll around the top floor of the house and found that the bedroom window was
open. She lingered in the draught with her gaze out over the city. &quot;You have a
better view from your room.&quot; Haruka scratched the deep of her armpit. &quot;Maybe it
was stupid to allow Michiru to choose wallpaper.&quot; She smiled and closed the
window. &quot;I hope you like bright blue.&quot; She turned towards the bed, saw the
sheets and blankets lying there in a disarray. Walked towards it, felt the cold
fabric with her fingers while the scent of Michiru and herself rose towards her
making her dizzy, but this time with affection. This was the grove of their
relation, there they had conceived the dream of children. Haruka arranged the
bed as she savoured the memory of Michiru&#39;s words. It was a night when neither
of them could sleep, they rested close below the heavy blanket and the closeness
made them aware of what their relationship lacked, offspring. They had looked at
each other, Michiru brought that youthful look to her face while her lips curled
to a smile. &quot;Do you want a baby?&quot; Haruka repeated the words that Michiru had
spoken into her ear that night and smiled. It had taken some time and they had
needed some help but one morning she emerged victorious from the bathroom with
her pregnancy test in hand. Michiru had covered her mouth with her hands before
she screamed and then the two joined in a embrace.
	Haruka opened the refrigerator and glanced over the content, took the
metal jug containing orange juice and walked over the piece of bench beside the
stove. Took a tall glass from the cupboard, poured the well coloured juice into
it then reached towards the tray adorned with stacked apples, bananas and unshu
mikans. Her hand hovered a moment over a lustrous apple before she decided on a
banana. Returned the jug to the fridge before she took her snack with her into
the living room. She extended her body over the couch, sipped from the juice
then began peeling the banana. Took a bite and closed her eyes while she chewed
and listened to the silence, came to the slow realisation that she needed to pee
and sighed. struggled of the couch into the bathroom.
	The air still smelled of Michiru&#39;s perfume, Haruka inhaled it as she
closed and locked the door behind her. The scent could linger for hours around
the house, be transferred to Haruka as she brushed up against her wife for a
kiss. She passed the mirror on her way to the toilet, gave herself a quick
glance. Her face had grown traces of her pregnancy, tired bags below her eyes,
skin not as flexible and a hue weaker in colour. She inhaled, regained a
pregnant posture with her belly pouting out and the changes to her face did not
feel so bad. After this valley her beauty would only reach the height, the peak
of a mothers beauty.
	Why did evolution make it so a grown uterus pushed so much on the
bladder? Today was a good day. To pee three times in three hours was good,
yesterday she went twice before breakfast and once directly afterwards. It
leaked too, during strain she could feel it, not much, but enough to make it
both uncomfortable and embarrassing. And it was even more embarrassing when she
was with  Michiru.
	She made herself comfortable on the couch once again, switched the TV on
with the remote, sipped from the orange juice while she zapped between the
channels. Found something interesting and replaced the remote with the rest of
the banana. Relaxed and took a bite while looking at the two cars speeding down
a concrete lane. The roar of the engines reached her eardrums and cradled her
mind into a calm and she slowly fell asleep with a half eaten banana leaned
against her chin.
