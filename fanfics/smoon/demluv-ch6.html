  Usagi took a deep breath and let it out 
slowly. 
  &quot;I guess I&#39;ll start with when Celeste 
transferred her powers to Mamoru. She 
transferred powers from both of her parents. 
The Earth&#39;s powers from King Endymion, and 
Pluto&#39;s powers of time and order from Setsuna. 
  While Mamoru&#39;s soul readily accepted the 
Earth&#39;s power, his soul had to change in order 
to accept the power of Pluto... or die. 
  Mamoru&#39;s soul did change, along with his 
personality... and, his soul bond to me. 
  The fates have predetermined which two soul 
types would be compatible as soul mates, 
generally one female and one male. Your soul 
and Mamoru&#39;s original soul were almost 
identical, just as perhaps Jadeite&#39;s soul and 
my own were nearly exact. Mamoru&#39;s soul and my 
own aren&#39;t compatible anymore, and we are no 
longer soul mated.&quot; 
  A lump formed in her throat and she choked it 
down. 
  &quot;We are destined to rule Crystal Tokyo over 
the next millennia, both of us soul mated to 
someone else. When I spoke with my Mother about 
it, she told me that Gaea had predestined, by 
oath, that the Moon shall be forever linked with 
the Earth. The oath includes our powers. The 
ginsuishou and the kinsuishou are linked 
similarly.
  My mother also helped me to realize that a 
destiny link between kingdoms did not 
necessarily mean &#39;rule together by marriage&#39;, 
although that is the only way Crystal Tokyo can 
come about on Earth.&quot; 
  She glanced over at Rei anxiously, and 
wondered what her stony silence meant. Rei 
stared intently at something across the room. 
  &quot;My Mother pointed out that I could rule the 
Moon Kingdom alone, like she did when her soul 
mate, Apollo, was taken from her. I would then 
resume the Silver Millennium, and rule as she 
did before everything was destroyed. Our 
kingdoms would be aligned politically and 
defensively by divined law.&quot; 
  Usagi touched Rei&#39;s cheek with a long delicate 
finger.    
  &quot;Because I love Mamoru, and I believe everyone 
deserves true love and a chance for lasting 
happiness, I feel it is in everyone&#39;s best 
interest if I rule alone. Maybe my soul mate can 
find happiness as well.&quot;
  Rei turned to scrutinize Usagi&#39;s face a few 
moments, before she turned away and responded 
bitterly.
  &quot;So, everything is all neat and tidy, hmmm? 
Since Mamoru is no longer an option, you felt my 
attraction for you, and thought you could come 
to me as your own last resort for love? Is that 
it? You would actually try to take advantage of 
my latest heartbreak with a man, and try to 
seduce me? You just thought that in my abject 
weakness, you could just waltz in here, and I 
would throw myself at your feet in gratitude?
  Kami... what a fool you take me for! 
  What makes you think I could love another 
woman anyway... even if she is my soul mate, and 
it is you? Kami forbid that I should be regarded 
in such a perverted way! Miko-sama indeed! Tell 
me again, why it is, I should allow myself to be 
someone&#39;s second choice.&quot; 
  Rei finished with harsh indignation.
  Usagi was stunned. Her lungs and throat seemed 
to tighten painfully, and she struggled for air. 
She could barely whisper.
  &quot;Rei, its not like that! Mamoru has been my 
destiny, my duty... and yes, I love him... but 
he has always been my second choice for a mate 
and lover. 
  I will not shame myself, or you, another 
moment! I never considered for an instant that
love between two people could be construed as 
perverse. I can assure you, what has happened 
here today, will never be repeated... if that is 
your desire. 
  Please forgive me for my intrusion. I never 
intended to insult you! I shouldn&#39;t have tried 
to kiss you, Rei. I am sorry... I was just so 
overcome by happiness. I will understand if you 
cannot be one of my senshi anymore... I don&#39;t 
want you to be uncomfortable. The desire for 
fulfillment with my soul mate will be with me 
always, however. 
  You seem to be on the mend, so I... will leave 
you now.&quot; 
  Usagi stood up shakily and turned to leave, 
but her knees betrayed her and buckled under her 
from exhaustion. She crumpled to the floor and 
managed to struggle to her knees.
  Rei sat up, and silently extended a hand. She 
felt hot tears plip onto her arm.
  &quot;Wait.&quot; She whispered back, in disbelief. 
  &quot;I have always been first in your heart?&quot;
  Usagi answered her with the barest of 
whispers... &quot;Always.&quot;
  Usagi turned on her knees to face the futon so 
she could see Rei&#39;s beautiful royal amethyst 
eyes and sniffled. 
  Rei felt rebuked when she saw genuine hurt 
from spurned love in her friend&#39;s eyes. 
  She took Usagi&#39;s hands into her own, and 
entwined her fingers to steady them.
  &quot;Kami, Usagi... &quot; 
  Usagi swallowed to clear her tight throat.
  &quot;Rei, I came here alone because I felt your 
soul draw me here. I felt your pain, not your 
attraction. I didn&#39;t come to seduce you! I&#39;ve 
been just as confused as you have been. When my 
memories of the Silver Millennium came back to 
me after my mother left, they served only to 
make my torture complete. I felt your attraction 
for me only after my memories returned, and then 
everything fell into place. 
  I wanted... needed confirmation from your own 
lips, that you were my soul mate and that you 
loved me. I never meant to toy with your 
affections! That&#39;s the truth. 
  Believe me when I say I need you, indeed, I&#39;m 
going to need all of my senshi. I need your 
strength, your wisdom, and instincts to help me 
rule as Moon Queen. I especially need you, Rei. 
  I want you to understand that my desire to 
love you, care for you, and make you happy, is 
real... if you&#39;ll have me. I want you as my 
beloved, not because you are my last option for 
a soul mate, but because I&#39;m truly in love with 
you. My love for you never stopped. I loved you 
before I was ever introduced to Endymion while 
my Mother reigned over the Silver Millennium. 
  I have remembered the time when I rescued you 
off the planet of Mars and brought you to the 
Moon Kingdom as my senshi. I remember when and 
how I fell in love with you... and I remember 
when I made love to you for the first time.&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s voice softened. 
  &quot;Kami help me, I love you, unconditionally, 
with all that I am.&quot; 
  Then softer still she uttered with devotion. 
  &quot;You were my first love... Diana, and... I 
want you back. I want what we had back. I have 
gotten over Mamoru many times already, mostly 
because my senshi were there for me, but I have 
never gotten over you... I can&#39;t live without 
you. 
  If in this life, you can not physically love 
me as a woman, I&#39;ll understand... I do respect 
your position, Miko-sama.&quot; Usagi&#39;s body sagged 
wearily.
  Rei&#39;s eyes swam with unshed tears as she 
listened to Usagi&#39;s declaration of love in 
silent introspection. 
  Her own memories had begun to unlock and 
manifest her old identity, and old wounds.
  I am a noble Martian huntress, I am the 
princess... Diana! Princess Serenity was my 
first love...
  She found her voice at last and it sounded 
hoarse. 
  &quot;You have caused my own memories to return, 
and I remember what happened to me after you met 
Endymion. 
  I watched as a hunger grew and your desire 
blossomed into a passion for... him. I ached for 
you, and wished I could trade places with him. I 
longed for you to look into my eyes with the 
same passion... just as you had before you met 
him. 
  It seemed you had forgotten me, and what we 
had. I didn&#39;t think there was any hope for a 
relationship, so I gave it up and kept you in my 
dreams. When I met Jadeite, I let him pursue me, 
though my heart still belonged to you. Frankly, 
I don&#39;t ever want to go through that again.&quot;
  Usagi forced her head to look up.
  &quot;Oh, Rei, I hadn&#39;t forgotten about you. I 
could never. My mother knew about us and forbade 
me to see you as a lover, nor would she grant me 
permission to bond with you in any way. So I 
served my Kingdom, bowed to destiny, and slept 
alone. You became just another one of my honored
senshi... except in my heart and in my dreams. 
There, I dreamt of a ship en route to the Moon 
Kingdom, and a bed I shared with you. 
  How I hurt inside when I saw the betrayal in 
your beautiful eyes.&quot; Usagi interjected as tears 
clouded her eyes once more. 
  She swallowed painfully. 
  &quot;I was never aware, though, that Endymion and 
I were ever observed by anyone. I thought we 
were fairly discreet. 
  I would never knowingly hurt you with a public 
display of our affections. I am so sorry if I 
did.&quot;
  &quot;Usagi,&quot; Rei began, &quot;as your body guard on 
duty, I tailed you and hid in the trees. I 
shouldn&#39;t have spied on you, but I... had 
opportunity, and well, I hurt myself. I got what 
I deserved. But that&#39;s ancient history, now 
isn&#39;t it? What matters now is the present.&quot; 
  Rei cleared her dry throat and continued. 
  &quot;Look, Usagi, I&#39;m a little relationship-shy 
right now. I want to believe you, but I can&#39;t. 
  I think if your bond was restored to Mamoru, I 
would continue to be as I have always been for 
you. I also think you will do as you are 
expected, soul mated or not. 
  I have no future with you... no matter how 
much you may love me. Had you come to me at any 
time before your bond with Mamoru was broken, I 
might have felt more inclined to believe you... 
but you didn&#39;t.
  I&#39;m very sorry I tried to end my life today... 
it was weak and it won&#39;t happen again. I want to 
be your senshi, Usagi. Your friendship has been 
one of the few bright spots in my life. Because 
we are soul mates shouldn&#39;t change anything.&quot; 
Rei heaved a shuddered sigh. 
  Usagi fought her fatigue and sat straighter.
  &quot;Rei, the discovery of our soul bond does make 
a difference for me. I will rule the Moon 
Kingdom as Queen Serenity, even if there is a 
way for the powers of Pluto to be restored to 
Celeste. I needed the truth, not only for my own 
happiness, but for the right destiny for all of 
us. What conclusions you come to about my love 
for you, are your own business. If you can&#39;t 
trust me, there is no hope for a closer 
relationship. 
  I really need to get some rest, now, Rei. If 
there is a way for me to ease your pain, tell 
me. I am here for you.&quot; Usagi crawled over to 
her futon, lay down, and pulled the quilt over 
herself as an afterthought. She shivered and 
closed her eyes. She felt awful.
  The room was pregnant with silence for awhile.
  Usagi had bared her soul. Bonds that had 
ordered her destiny for millennia had been 
shattered, and denied true love exposed. Rei had
crushed her.  
  Rei spoke softly.
  &quot;Usagi, are you asleep?&quot;
  &quot;No.&quot; She muttered sleepily.
  &quot;Do you still love me?&quot; Rei&#39;s voice sounded 
strained.
  Usagi sighed heavily.
  &quot;Hai.&quot; 
  &quot;Usa... ?&quot; Rei began again.
  &quot;Hmmm?&quot; Usagi could feel Rei&#39;s presence move
closer. 
  &quot;I can scarcely believe you would choose to 
rule the Moon Kingdom by yourself. If that 
choice was based on my bond and love for you, I 
think I ought to consider your future with me.
  I have a lot of pride to swallow, and even 
more forgiveness to ask for. I&#39;ve gone out of my 
way to alienate you every way I know how in this 
lifetime. 
  There has never been another soul who has 
shown me as much unconditional love as you have. 
Nor has there been any other who has taught me 
more about what true sacrifice is or what real 
forgiveness is all about. You have given me far 
more joy than I deserve. 
  I don&#39;t deserve you, or your love, Usagi. 
Can&#39;t you see?&quot;
  Rei wiped Usagi&#39;s tear filled eyes to clear 
them.
  &quot;You can&#39;t see, can you... your love is 
completely blind, isn&#39;t it? You don&#39;t see 
people, you just see souls, don&#39;t you? You 
truly are an Angel... a Goddess here on Earth. 
You&#39;ll never understand how different you are! 
  While I have been busy wallowing in my self 
pity over matters of the past that are of no 
consequence, you have been wrestling with the 
fate of a future kingdom. 
  You wrestle with how you can personally make 
other people&#39;s lives better, and then pour out 
your entire heart and soul to make it a reality. 
You are selfless whereas I am selfish! You came 
here to comfort me and see to my happiness. You 
put my needs first, and I lashed out at you to 
protect myself. 
  How could I not, how could anyone not love you 
or want you!&quot; Rei declared with passion.  
  &quot;Usagi, I don&#39;t know if you can ever forgive 
me for today, but if you can find it in your 
heart to do so, I&#39;d like to have another 
opportunity to be able to express my love for 
you... even if it&#39;s inadequate. 
  I do love you. I need you... and I want you 
physically. I&#39;m sorry for what I implied 
earlier... its self-preservation, Usa. I have 
been called strange all my life, and to love 
another woman today seems to exacerbate 
matters.&quot;
  Usagi wept. 
  &quot;You... you know I forgive you... and you 
could never be... inadequate! You are my 
passion.&quot;
  Usagi smiled at Rei through her tears, and 
sniffles. 
  &quot;If you knew the things I&#39;ve thought about 
when I look at you, &#39;Angel&#39; wouldn&#39;t exactly be 
on your list of descriptions for me!&quot; 
  Rei&#39;s eyes had a glimmer of mirth in them, but 
her voice was raw with contained emotion as she 
looked back into her princess&#39; dewy eyes. 
  &quot;I honestly can&#39;t comprehend why or how you 
can still love me after all these years, Usagi. 
  You asked me how you could help to ease my 
pain, Usagi. Would you consider a bond to join 
with me body, mind, and soul? Is your love for 
me strong enough to make a commitment? I don&#39;t 
ever want to lose you again!&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s tears turned to joy as Rei lay down 
next to her on the futon and cradled her close. 
Nestled in the embrace of Rei&#39;s strong arms, she 
found comfort there at long last. After a few 
moments, Usagi answered her.
  &quot;I love you enough to join with you in the 
highest order of oaths outside of marriage... 
the blood bond oath. I will need to ask Mamoru&#39;s
permission first, though. I don&#39;t think he would 
ever stand in the way of my happiness... any 
more than I would his. We need to ask my Mother 
and your Mother&#39;s permission as well, because 
they are needed to perform the ceremony.
  By the way, Rei-chan, you are a Goddess, too! 
  I think my Mother will consent and give us her 
blessing this time. I don&#39;t know if your Mother 
will, though.&quot;
  Rei squeezed her princess.
  &quot;If we are meant to be, then everything will 
work out, Angel.&quot; Angel was emphasized with a 
twinkle in her eyes. 
  &quot;Are you sure you want to spend the rest of 
your life bound to someone as bizarre and 
stubborn as I am?&quot; Rei teased.
  Usagi giggled, &quot;Hai, I do, oh aberrant one!&quot;  
  &quot;Thank you so much for your love, Hime-sama! 
You&#39;ve made me feel a whole lot better about 
myself, and life, today. You truly live what 
you believe.&quot; 
  Rei kissed each beautiful sapphire eye. 
  &quot;You know, I have loved you from afar, as 
forbidden fruit, for so long... now that I have 
you close, I haven&#39;t a clue what to do with 
you!&quot; Rei laughed.
  Usagi smiled. She loved to hear the rich 
melodic peal of Rei&#39;s seldom heard laughter. 
  &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll think of something. 
Besides, it doesn&#39;t matter, I just want to feel 
your nearness.&quot; Usagi&#39;s eyes sparkled like gems 
in the bright moonlight of a now cloudless sky.   
  Rei, looked intently into them, and she 
leaned into her and began to softly kiss those 
beautiful lips that smiled so readily... so
generously. 
  Exhaustion forgotten, Usagi responded with 
fervor, and her heart began to fly. As she felt 
Rei&#39;s tongue flick rhythmically down her throat, 
she felt a pulsed throb between her legs in 
response and an ache in her loins. 
  Rei trailed moist butterfly kisses from 
Usagi&#39;s wet cheeks down to her throat. She 
pressed her tongue against the carotid, and felt 
its beat strong and rapid. 
  Then, she noticed the bruises for the first 
time. They were much too regular, almost as 
if... 
  Something clicked inside Rei, and she 
understood the full scope of her princess&#39; pain. 
  She kissed each bruise tenderly. 
  &quot;These aren&#39;t bruises from passionate kisses, 
are they Usa? Mamoru has been rough with you, 
hasn&#39;t he?&quot; 
  Usagi nodded. 
  &quot;He&#39;s has taken his frustrations, and anger 
out on me physically... he isn&#39;t exactly the 
same man he was before. Those are bruises from 
his hand while he held me down. It was to keep 
me still so I wouldn&#39;t thrash or scream as he 
entered me while I was still dry.&quot; 
  Rei sat up, and pulled Usagi with her, clearly 
angry. She began to gather the sheer nightgown 
material together so she could bring it up over 
her friend&#39;s head. 
  Usagi swallowed with difficulty as Rei slowly 
lifted the gown over her head, she shivered as 
she felt Rei&#39;s warm breath on her bare shoulder. 
When she opened her eyes, she looked into a pair 
of amethyst eyes that seethed with anger.
  &quot;Kami, Usa, you let him rape you... just 
because he was your destined! I gave place to 
him and trusted him with you!&quot; 
  Rei&#39;s voice was low and raw, almost a growl. 
  &quot;I want to have a look at you... all of you. I 
can&#39;t believe you haven&#39;t told me how much he&#39;s 
hurt you, especially after all we&#39;ve talked 
about!&quot; Her voice cracked, &quot;Why?&quot; 
  Usagi looked shyly at the furious raven-haired 
girl.
  &quot;I just did tell you! I don&#39;t want you to 
confront him, Rei... just let it go. It&#39;s over, 
now, ok?&quot;
  Rei responded stiffly. 
  &quot;You told me only after I discovered it... 
probably after weeks of abuse! You weren&#39;t going 
to say squat to me, or to anyone else! And you 
bet it&#39;s over. If he ever touches you like this 
again, I&#39;ll make him regret it. 
  Tartarus will seem like a picnic.&quot;
  Usagi&#39;s face turned bright red. 
  &quot;Promise me, you won&#39;t punish him, Rei,&quot; she 
whispered.
  Rei laid the nightgown aside, and tossed the 
quilt onto the other futon angrily. Rei sat back 
on her heals and took in Usagi&#39;s physical 
beauty. She sucked her breath in sharply, and 
felt her fire build in her own loins and her 
face began to flush. 
  Kami-sama! 
  Usagi is so breathtakingly gorgeous! She&#39;s so 
gracefully built... like the ice dancer she 
was. Lean and hard.
  &quot;You are so incredibly beautiful, so 
desirable, Usagi, how could he do this to you?&quot;
   Through her tears, Rei could see the bruises 
around Usagi&#39;s nipples and small firm breasts, 
which were smaller than her own, but so round 
and perfect! She touched each bruise softly 
with her tongue, then, brushed her lips against 
the sore nipples. 
  Usagi thought she had never felt anything so 
delicate or so full of love. It thrilled her to 
her soul.
  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you, 
especially from someone you loved and trusted. I 
need to remove your underwear, and have a look. 
I promise I won&#39;t hurt you, alright?&quot;
  Usagi trembled as Rei&#39;s fingers traced a path 
down the sides of her ribcage, and barely 
touched. Rei&#39;s lips continued to lay a train of 
delicate butterfly kisses in the valley between 
her firm breasts. Then, inch by inch, Rei moved 
downward and savored each kiss... she loved her 
smell, her taste. Her princess&#39; flesh was so 
incredibly smooth and soft... like rose petals 
stretched over sculpted musculature. So sinewy, 
so sensuous... 
  Rei ran her tongue around Usagi&#39;s navel, and 
gently sucked on it as she caressed the firm 
hips. 
  Usagi moaned softly... her desire for Rei 
over-rode any thought processes. 
  She sucked her breath in as Rei&#39;s fingers 
captured the waistband of the white lace 
underwear and drew them slowly down long, 
slender, hard legs. Usagi could feel Rei&#39;s 
breaths as they came harder and faster. They 
tickled her and sent goose bumps all over her 
body, as Rei paused above the silver-blond curls 
between her legs. 
  Then Usagi&#39;s brain engaged. She whimpered and 
clutched at Rei&#39;s hands, as they sought to part 
her legs. 
  Rei stopped at the small noise and gesture and 
looked up to lock her gaze upon Usagi&#39;s dark 
frightened eyes. She cursed Mamoru under her 
breath. Kami, how he must have hurt her angel! 
  Rei wanted to cry. 
  &quot;I would rather die than hurt you, my love, I 
can promise you I will never ever hurt you 
sexually. I know what that feels like, and I 
won&#39;t ever touch you there if you don&#39;t want me 
to. But for this once, I do need to see if you 
need some help. Your mouth feels hot to me, when 
we kiss. You may have more than a cold to fight. 
You could have an infection too, sweetie, please 
let me see if you are alright?&quot; 
  Usagi bit her lip hard, and finally nodded her 
assent. 
  Rei parted Usagi&#39;s thighs and knelt carefully
between them. She first saw the dark bruises 
upon the inner thighs as if they had been held 
open in their present position by something. 
Rei&#39;s fingers roved lightly over the bruised 
area and raised more goose bumps. 
  She lifted her friend&#39;s legs up and farther 
apart, and wanted to curse some more as she let 
her eyes rest on Usagi&#39;s femaleness. The area 
was red, swollen, and looked painful. 
  Rei felt sick, and had to fight off a sudden 
new wave of nausea. She took some deep breaths, 
then bent forward and very softly touched her 
lips to the clitoris. She laid a feather-light 
kiss there. 
  Usagi trembled in need and fear all at once, 
but Rei gently let Usagi&#39;s legs down. 
  Rei wordlessly replaced the underwear, and 
the nightgown. Usagi probably hadn&#39;t felt well 
for a while and never said anything about it. 
She felt angry and betrayed.
  Rei lay down alongside Usagi, and gathered 
her princess close. 
  &quot;Before we go to sleep, Usagi, I have a few 
requests of my own I&#39;d like to make. First, 
tomorrow we go see a gynecologist, no arguments. 
Second, I want you to promise me you won&#39;t see 
Mamoru again until he gets some help. Third, and 
most importantly to me, I would like for you to 
consider a life here with me. We seem to 
suddenly be a little short-handed around here!&quot; 
  Usagi lifted her head to face Rei. 
  &quot;Ok, no arguments, I promise, and I thought 
you would never ask!&quot;
  Rei&#39;s eyes widened and she smiled. Rei rolled 
on top of Usagi, kissed her lips a few times and 
rolled off of her. She flipped off of the bed 
and headed for the bathroom on unsteady legs.
  When Rei came back, Usagi had fallen asleep, 
and a gentle smile graced her lips. She had 
managed to take up the entire bed in a tangle of 
lanky arms, legs and blanket. 
  Rei smiled fondly... she wasn&#39;t so small 
anymore at 5&#39;10&quot;. She had finally achieved Queen 
Serenity&#39;s height. Rei was only an inch taller 
now, instead of several. 
  Rei put on a red silk nightgown, then phoned 
Dr. Wakai&#39;s office, the OBGYN who had seen her 
as a child, and left a brief message on the 
answer machine. She glanced at her empty futon  
and then turned her gaze back to the unconscious 
goddess. 
  Rei turned the desk lamp out, snatched the 
blankets from off the empty futon, re-arranged 
Usagi, and curled up next to her. She pulled the 
blankets over the both of them, and sighed. It 
seemed each of them had their own personal demons 
to deal with. But in spite of everything... they 
had found love. 
  That was Rei&#39;s last coherent thought as sleep 
overwhelmed her.

                   * * * 
  Rei was awakened about three hours later when 
she felt Usagi shiver next to her, sniffle, and 
move restlessly. 
  Rei got up and drank some water. Then she went
to find a new box of tissues and some aspirin. 
She filled a new cup with water, and brought it 
all over to the futon. 
  &quot;Usa!&quot; Rei shook her friend slightly.
  Usagi rolled away from her tormenter. 
  &quot;Mom, need sleep... don&#39;t wanna go... throat&#39;s 
scratchy... &quot;
  Rei snickered. 
  &quot;Usagi, it&#39;s Rei, and I thought you might like 
a tissue, and some medicine with water.&quot;
  Usagi stirred. 
  &quot;Water.&quot; She repeated and sneezed. She opened 
her eyes sleepily. 
  &quot;Rei?&quot;
  Rei grinned. 
  &quot;That would be me! Sit up.&quot; Rei said and 
offered Usagi the tissue. 
  &quot;It seems your charitable nature has finally 
turned against you. I think you officially have 
a nasty cold. Or maybe you caught my... flu 
bug.&quot; Rei laughed. Here take these, they will 
help you sleep. Then maybe I can get some 
sleep!&quot; 
  Rei held the pills out to Usagi, then, handed 
her the cup of water. 
  Usagi glared irritably at Rei, but gratefully 
took what was offered. 
  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to wake you up. 
Thank you for your care, Rei. I should probably 
go sleep in your guest room so I won&#39;t keep you 
awake any more, or give my cold to you. Trust 
me... you don&#39;t want this one!&quot; 
  Usagi used another tissue, got up and grabbed 
one of the quilts, then began to drag the futon 
out the door.
  Rei stopped her. 
  &quot;Wait, Usagi! What just happened? I didn&#39;t 
mean to upset you. I just wanted to tease you a 
little! Please stay with me. I&#39;m concerned about 
you! I&#39;ve already gotten well over eight hours 
of sleep, thanks to you. You&#39;ve hardly gotten 
any. If I have to stay up the rest of the night 
to make sure you are comfortable, it&#39;s all 
right. I don&#39;t want you to get any worse, Usa.&quot; 
  Rei took the futon from Usagi and stuffed it 
into her cupboard. 
  Usagi protested as Rei picked her up and 
carried her back to the futon and put her down 
gently.
  &quot;I&#39;m not worried about a silly cold. I&#39;m 
exposed to them all of the time when people want 
me to pray for their sick babies. I&#39;ve had lots 
of them, and I&#39;m still here. More than likely, 
I&#39;ve already had this one. 
  So, if you try to escape again, I&#39;ll punish 
you in the name of Mars with an evil thermometer 
where the sun doesn&#39;t shine!&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s gave Rei a gratuitous shudder in 
response. 
  Rei was satisfied. She tidied the quilts and 
cuddled up close to her angel, and once more 
drew the quilts up over the both of them. Rei 
kissed Usagi&#39;s creamy, exposed, shoulder. 
  &quot;I love you!&quot; She whispered.
  Usagi never heard her. 
  Rei listened to Usagi&#39;s heavy breaths for a 
while then dropped off to sleep.
  The girls slept without incident late into 
Monday morning.
