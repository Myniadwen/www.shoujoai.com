<p>&quot;Usagi-chan, get up.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Snoooooore.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Usagi...&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>Snooooore</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;Usagi!!&quot;</p>
<p>Usagi  jerked awake with a small eep and wiped at the small trail of drool.  Rei sighed in distaste and walked to the kitchen. She grabbed a sheet  of Bounty and walked back into the study room, and began to wipe at the  miniature ouddle on the table top.</p>
<p>&quot;You're dangerous around my  tables Usagi-chan.&quot; The miko said with a small smirk. Usagi raised an  eyebrow and said cautiously, &quot;Oh? And why is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cause you drooling all over the damn place will wear out the varnish sooner or later.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka,  Minako, and Makoto all busted out into fits of laughter at this, while  Ami and Michiru politely hid their giggles behind their hands. Setsuna  only allowed a small twitch of her lips. Usagi, recognizing this as a  friendly jab more than an insult, humphed and lightly punched Rei's  shoulder. &quot;Jerk.&quot; she said with a small grin.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, but what does that make you Queeny?&quot; Rei teased back.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  wait a--&quot; the Princess's retort was cut off by a rapid knocking at the  entrance to the main shrine. Rei stood and jogged to the entrance,  throwing back a victorious little grin that said, &quot;Haha, I win!&quot;</p>
<p>Usagi pouted. &quot;Darn! How come she <em>always</em> gets the last word!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cause  she's a pimp and you're jealous?&quot; Minako giggled. Even more giggles and  laughs were shared. &quot;Th-that doesn't even make sense Minako-chan!&quot; Ami  choked.</p>
<p>&quot;Phooey on sense then!&quot;</p>
<p>Setsuna grinned, then blinked as she heard the Rei greet the visitor with a cold, <em>&quot;Oh...hello Chichioya...&quot;</em> The guardian of time silenced the group with a harsh 'shhh' and  motioned them to come near the door. At the eldest Senshi's call, the  younger Senshi pressed their ears to the door to hear the conversation.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Humph. I see that old bat  finally keeled over.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yes...My  Grandfather has passed on. I would very much apprecate it if, while you  are in my home, you would address him honorably Chichioya.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Bah. You haven't lost your arrogance. What makes you think that this is <strong>your</strong> home Rei?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;It  was in his will that I would gain ownership of the Jinjia when he  passed on. And, I'm eighteen, so I'm legally old enough to own it.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Not for long.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Beg pardon?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot; This will soon be mine Rei; along with you.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, and the Senshi began to share nervous looks. They had never met Rei's father before, but--</p>
<p>&quot;This  guy sounds like a total ass!&quot; Minako hissed. Usagi nodded her agreement  and quietly slid open the shoji screen doors. She eased around the  small space provided, and tip-toed down the hall, stopping when she  reached the corner. Not long after, she heard Minako and the others  follow. When she got her first look at Rei's father, she covered her  mouth to stifle her gasp. The man was a near mirror image of Rei, save  for the cold ebony eyes and cruel scowl.</p>
<p>&quot;Chichioya,&quot; Rei began  in the same cold, detached voice. &quot;I'm afraid you released all  connections and ownership of my person when you disowned me.&quot;</p>
<p>The  scowl transformed into a sneer. &quot;Dear me; was that supposed to hurt?&quot;  Rei, to the shock of all, bowed her head a small fraction. &quot;Gomen  Chichioya; that was rude of me.&quot;</p>
<p>Rei's father laughed, a cruel  sound that made the hairs on the back of Usagi's neck stand. He  stopped, then fixed his daughter with blazing black eyes. &quot;I want this  shrine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry Chichioya, but that is impossible. I am the  owner, and I regret to say that I am not selling.&quot; That was when Rei's  father exploded.</p>
<p>&quot;You ungrateful little <em>bitch!</em>&quot; Rei didn't even flinch. &quot;How <em>dare</em> you!? I gave you everything you asked for! I spoiled you rotten!&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka and Minako shared a look; Rei certaintly didn't look spoiled to them.</p>
<p>&quot;You...gave me <em>everything</em> I asked for?&quot; Rei laughed harshly. &quot;Then tell me Chichioya; where's my <em>real</em> father? You know, the kind that actually <em>cares </em>about their child!? I sure as hell don't know him.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>The  miko's head was jerked to the side roughly, an ugly red bruise  beginning to form on her right cheek. Her father's hand was poised in  the air.</p>
<p>Usagi gripped her broach so tightly she could've sworn  that there was blood. Casting a quick look to her fellow Senshi, she  was proud to see looks of rage as each of them gripped their own  henshin wand tightly. Makoto was physically held back.</p>
<p>She turned  back to the scene in front of her. Rei had lifted her head and stared  without quivering at the enraged man. &quot;Is that the way you solve  things?&quot; she taunted. &quot;By smacking them around or bribing them? Let me  assure you <em>Chichioya,</em>&quot; This time, she said this with malice. &quot;I won't be swayed like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>You owe me for <strong>killing my wife! Your </strong></em><strong><em><u>mother!!</u></em></strong>&quot;</p>
<p>The  words rang throughout the complex, stunning the Senshi into stillness.  Makoto went limp and Setsuna had to catch Minako before she collapsed  to the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>What did you say?</em>&quot; Rei hissed softly.</p>
<p>&quot;If <strong><em>you</em></strong> hadn't been born, then maybe my wife would've had the chance to live and <strong><em>I</em></strong> would have gained a son. A true heir! Not a whimpering little brat who  murdered her own mother and shames her memory with every single breath  she takes.&quot;</p>
<p>Silence thick with tension filled the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Get out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Rei's father sputtered.</p>
<p>&quot;I said get out.&quot; Rei snarled.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll have you know--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Get out before I call the police!</em>&quot; Her father stiffend and smirked coldly.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine, Rei-<em>chan</em>.&quot;  He bowed, taunted her with the endearment that had been turned into an  insult. &quot;But just you wait; I'll get this shrine, and you'll burn in  Hell for <em>killing</em> your mother.&quot; With that, he opened the door and strode out, slamming it closed with a loud bang.</p>
<p>Usagi clenched her teeth against a sob and wondered how a father could be so...so...</p>
<p>&quot;You all can come out now.&quot;</p>
<p>Usagi was the first to slowly make her way around the corner. Rei wasn't facing her.</p>
<p>&quot;Rei-chan...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would  you all mind if I meditated for a bit? Keep the study session goin  without me.&quot; The raven-haired girl turned and flashed them a fake  smile. &quot;I'll be out in a few minutes.&quot; She turned and shuffled to the  meditation room, where the Sacred Fire burned. Silence once again  filled the air.</p>
<p>&quot;You're going to follow her, ne Usagi?&quot; Minako murmured quietly.</p>
<p>The future queen nodded slowly and padded to the meditation room herself.</p>
<p>&quot;God...how could he...how <em>dare</em> he...&quot; Haruka began, her fists clenching and unclenching in rage.  Makoto grunted, her focus on finding out where that bastard lived and  paying a visit...</p>
<p>&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Ami whispered quietly, running a  gentle, but shaking, hand through her girlfriend's tawny locks.  &quot;Please, don't do anything rash!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That goes for you too Ruka,&quot;  Michiru muttered, taking a hand that continued with its motions of  clench, release, clench, release.</p>
<p>&quot;Tch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, you take all the fun outta things Michi...&quot;</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p>Muted  sobs came through the door. Shaky breaths and whispered heartaches  slipped through the small crack, jabbing at Usagi's own heart. It shook  her that Rei, the strongest girl she knew-in terms of emotion-was  crying. She'd only seen Rei cry...maybe...two times? And those had been  because of her... Taking a few minutes to scrape up her courage, Usagi  dwelled on the very first memory of Rei she had.</p>
<p>And she nearly  cracked when she remembered how cold those violet eyes had been. So  similar to her father's sheets of unforgiving obsidian.</p>
<p><em>Oh Rei...I swear, I will not let you become like him</em>...</p>
<p>She  slid open the door and almost sank to her knees in despair. Rei was  curled up in a little ball, rocking slowly, gasps and heavees coming  from her form.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm so sorry Mommy,&quot; came one quiet wail. &quot;I'm so  so sorry.&quot; Then her rocking became a bit faster, and hisses of,  &quot;Fucking monster,&quot; and &quot;Murderer&quot; escaped.</p>
<p>Usagi had a good hunch that Rei wasn't talking about her father.</p>
<p><em>My poor Rei...Oh my poor broken Rei</em>...</p>
<p>With  that thought, she slid the door closed behind her and slowly padded to  Rei's shaking form. As gently as she could, she took Rei's face between  her hands and lifted it from her knees. There was a harsh gasp as Rei  began with, &quot;Wh-what are you--&quot;</p>
<p>And then there was silence as Usagi gently brought Rei's head to rest in the crook of her neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Get-get off me!&quot; Rei growled, but the demand was broken by the crack in her voice. &quot;I-I don't need your pity!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This  isn't pity,&quot; Usagi murmured, bringing up a hand to gently rest against  the back of her soldier's head, the other hand on the small of her back  to press her between the blonde's knees. The miko's arms immediatly  went to her leader's shoulders with the intent to shove her away, her  instinctual need to keep everyone at bay overiding her common sense.</p>
<p>&quot;Rei,&quot;  Usagi breathed, gently nuzziling the miko's ear. In response, the  raven-haired girl shivered and the grip on her leader's shoulders  tightedned as she prepared to push her away, an injuring barb poised on  her toungue. &quot;Rei, please...just cry.&quot;</p>
<p>Everything shut down at the whispered command.</p>
<p>&quot;Baka-odango,&quot;  Rei swallowed, attempting to forse moisture into her seemungly cotton  filled mouth and throat. &quot;I don't cry, unlike you.&quot; Usagi stiffened,  then practically crushed Rei to her chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Rei...just this  once...don't keep me out.&quot; Usagi mumbled into the soldier's ear. &quot;Just  this once...let me in...Please...Just this once...&quot; Rei clenched her  teeth together and tried not to notice how...<em>right</em> it felt in the blonde's arms, trying not to let out tears, trying not to lay her personal demons on her angel's wings...</p>
<p>&quot;Just  this once...&quot; the blonde pleaded, her sweet voice thick with unshead  tears. &quot;Please...&quot; A sob jolted the fire goddess, but she kept it in,  relishing in the pain it brought her ribs, hoping for just a tiny  distraction to keep her from crying again.</p>
<p>But when Usagi laid a soft, fluttering kiss to her slightly damp forehead, it all just broke.</p>
<p>She  gave a low, keening wail and buried her face, already soaked with  tears, into the blonde's neck. Usagi sighed and murmured her name  again, before tucking the already fragile girl even closer to her body,  relishing in the feel of scalding tears and harsh sobs.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm here  Rei-chan,&quot; she cooed softly, highly doubting that the miko could hear.  &quot;I'm here.&quot; But Rei shocked her when she took the hand at her back and  brought int to her chest, laying it over her heart as it thundered.</p>
<p>&quot;You're in.&quot;</p>
