<h1>Mamorue Must Die! (part 2 of 35)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/mamodie-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The Sailor Senshi were facing a particularly tough youma, one that 
appeared out of nowhere during an outdoor picnic and looked like a 
porcupine, capable of firing its quills at will at the heroines. As 
Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Mercury ducked under one of the attacks, the 
thing fired a group of the deadly needle-like projectiles at Sailor 
Moon, pinning her fuku to a nearby tree. As the young blond started to 
scream, a rose flew down at the monsters feet.

Looking up, Sailor Moon and the others saw Tuxedo Kamen standing on the 
branch of a large oak tree.

&quot;A picnic is meant to be a time for fun and joy, but you have ruined it 
by...&quot; he was cut off as the youma fired a volley of quills at him. He 
easily maneuvered out of the way, and they struck a hornet&#39;s nest on 
another branch, knocking it to the ground.

Leaping off the branch he was on, his cane shot forward and hit the 
youma in the face. Falling to the ground, Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s hat fell off 
his head. As Sailor Mars pulled the last of the quills out to release 
Sailor Moon, Tuxedo Kamen turned away from the stunned youma to face 
her.

&quot;Now, Sailor Moon!&quot; he shouted. The blond nodded as she faced the 
monster.

&quot;Moon Tiara Action!&quot; she shouted. A second later, the menace was no 
more.

&quot;Usagi,&quot; Sailor Mars asked with concern, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Usagi nodded quickly, &quot;Just a few cuts and scratches.&quot; she answered. 
Tuxedo smiled at her as he knelt down to retrieve his hat.

&quot;It&#39;s a good thing I was nearby.&quot; he said, not looking as he grabbed the 
nearest object he could find and put it on his head, &quot;If I hadn&#39;t showed 
up... ow... You would&#39;ve been... Ow! What the hell is... OW!&quot;

It was then that the hero realized that, instead of putting his top hat 
back on, he was wearing the hornet&#39;s nest on his head.

&quot;Aaaaa! Get it off! Get it off!&quot; he screamed as he ran around in circles 
waving his arms. Luna ran over at the sounds of yelling as Sailor Mars 
tried to come to his rescue.

&quot;Tuxedo Kamen!&quot; she yelled, &quot;Hold still! Fire Soul!&quot; she shouted.

Unfortunately, Tuxedo Kamen didn&#39;t hold still. He now started yelling 
louder, as the hornets continued their attack on his skull and the seat 
of his pants burst into flames at Sailor Mars&#39; attack. As both Luna and 
Sailor Moon watched, both Sailors Jupiter and Mercury decided, 
independent of one another, to come to Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s aid.

&quot;Jupiter Thunder Crash!&quot;

&quot;Mercury Aqua Rhapsody!&quot;

Unfortunately, the combination of a water attack and an electrical 
attack was not the best of ideas. As Sailor Moon tearfully walked over 
to the smoldering pile of ashes that had once been her fianc&eacute;e, both 
Mercury and Jupiter looked down sheepishly. Sailor Mars walked over 
carrying Luna in one arm as she put her other hand on Usagi&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m so sorry, Usagi-chan.&quot; she began, &quot;And yet... And yet I feel 
as if I can now finally say something I&#39;ve wanted to for a long time.&quot;

Sailor Moon wiped her eyes, &quot;Rei?&quot; she began, &quot;What...&quot;

&quot;I love you, Usagi.&quot; she admitted, &quot;I have for a while now, but I&#39;ve 
been too afraid to say anything, especially knowing what you and Mamoru 
meant to one another.&quot;

&quot;Rei.&quot; Usagi gasped, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say, I... But... But Mamoru 
just died, this is so sudden... Luna,&quot; Usagi said, looking at the cat in 
Rei&#39;s arms, &quot;Luna, Rei loves me, and I... I think that I... what should 
I do? Should I allow myself to fall in love again, this time with 
Rei-chan?&quot;

Luna rolled her eyes, &quot;Might as well,&quot; she quipped, motioning to the 
still smoldering pile of ashes with her paw, &quot;The future&#39;s fucked now 
anyways.&quot;
