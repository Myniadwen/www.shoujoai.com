<h1>Con Su Adios, Usted Toma Con Usted Mi Co (part 5 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Minako looked in thru the glass window to Makoto&#39;s room. Her friend 
laid there, comatose, for three days. And it worried Minako; she 
showed no sign of waking up ever.

The room Makoto laid in was dark, with no light, except for the heart 
moniter, that beeped a greenish blue in sync with Makoto&#39;s heart beat. 
Mianko&#39;s heart seemed to beat along with her friend&#39;s. And it ached 
when she could do nothing for her.

A pair of strong arms incircled Minako&#39;s waist and Mianko looked 
behind her and smiled a little. Her boyfriend, Mashou, had come to see 
her at the hospital. He was a lean boy with dark green that seemed to 
stay untidy, even after Minako would brush it wit her fingers. His 
eyes were a brilliant green and he wore glasses. He huugged Minako 
from behind and laid his head on her chin and smiled a little.

&quot;How is she doing,&quot; he asked quietly.

Mianko sighed. &quot;No different from yesterday. But no worse, so thats a 
good thing, I guess.&quot;

He nodded slightly. &quot;Are you ok?&quot;

Mianko bowed her head slightly and nodded. &quot;I think so.&quot; Minako turned 
her head back to face her friend. &quot;I just wish I knew if she will be 
alright...&quot;

~There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain~

Makoto groaned and opened her eyes. Rubbing her head with one hand, 
and braceing herself up with the other, she looked around, wondering 
where she was. There was a bluish grey mist all around her, and 
everything seemed dark. Not black, just dark.

She stood, wondering where she was. The last thing she remebered was 
being hit by a speeding car and hearing metal and glass crunch when it 
came into contact with her body. Then, nothing. I wonder if I&#39;m dead, 
she thought to herself.

&quot;No, you are not dead,&quot; came a voice behind her. Makoto spun aroun and 
gasped at who she saw. A small child, of no more than six stood before 
her. What shocked Makoto so much, was the child was her at that age.

Makoto stared at the girl in disbelief. &quot;Who...who are you?&quot;

The girl smiled sweetly. &quot;You know who I am. I&#39;m you.&quot; The girl&#39;s face 
fell slightly. &quot;Well...sorta..&quot;

&quot;What do you mean sorta,&quot; Makoto asked.

Chibi-Mako looked back up. &quot;I&#39;m you, or, your younger self from a 
thousand years ago.&quot;

Makoto blinked and nodded. &quot;Riiiight...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t believe me?&quot;

Makoto laughed a little. &quot;Iie, I don&#39;t. I&#39;m either dreaming or I&#39;m 
dead. Which is it?&quot;

&quot;...A dream...&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Thats what I thought. How do I wake up from it?&quot;

Chibi-Mako bowed her head once again. &quot;You can&#39;t...not yet, anyway.&quot;

&quot;And just why not?!&quot;

&quot;I have to take you some place first.&quot; Chibi-Mako raised her head and 
looked into Makoto&#39;s eyes. &quot;But you must believe what you see.&quot;

Makoto looked skeptical. &quot;And if I don&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;Then you coming here was in vain, and you may never wake up.&quot;

Makoto blinked, and looked at her younger self. Something pulled at 
her heart;she knew something was about to happen that would change her 
life.

Chibi-Mako, sensing Makoto&#39;s will to agree to what she was about to 
do, she walked up to her and tugged on Makoto&#39;s arm, wanting her to 
kneel to her level. 

&quot;What you about to see and do, remeber no one can see you...these are 
memories that have been locked away from you,&quot; Chibi-Mako said, her 
little hands resting on either side of Makoto&#39;s face.

&quot;Why were they hidden?&quot;

Chibi-Mako smiled. &quot;It will be reveiled...&quot; Before Makoto could 
question the child, a bright green light engulfed them both. Makoto 
had to close her eyes when the blinding light struck them.

She could still feel the childs hand&#39;s on her face when the light hit 
them. Seconds after it engulfed them, Makoto felt the child&#39;s hands 
began to slip away. She tried to reach out to the child, but Makoto 
couldn&#39;t feel anyone in front of her. Frantic, Makoto snapped her eyes 
open. She was no longer standing in the mist...

~All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I&#39;ve loved them all~

Makoto stood from her knealing postion and took a look around her. The 
mist she and her former self had been standing in, had vanished. She 
was now in a stone and tiled hall way, the ceiling appeared to be 20 
feet or so high. The walls had huge portraits of kings, queens and 
other royalty and nobelity. Makoto stood, wondering where she had been 
transported to.

Hearing voices in a room down the hall, Makoto cautiously made her way 
over to the doors. They were cracked slightly, so Makoto peeked in, 
not wanting to be seen.

Inside she saw a man, who was large in both build and height, a brown 
beard, with a hint of gray, and his eyes were a dark green. He wore 
fine clothes of deep forest green, a belt around his waist doned a 
sword, and a golden crown with emeralds sat atop his head. he must be 
a king, Makoto thought to herself. The man he was talking to was quiet 
different. He wore white and silver, a small dagger at his hip instead 
of a sword. He was small compared to the king; he on;y came up to the 
man&#39;s shoulders. He had white blonde hair, and silver eyes. It was 
obvious they were fighting, but Makoto could not understand the 
language they were speaking.

As Makoto listened in, trying to figure out what was going on, a small 
child with chesnut brown hair pulled back into a pony tail, emarld 
eyes, and a few freckles came to stand beside her, trying to figure 
out was going on. When Makoto looked up, it was her forner self again. 

Sighing slightly, Makoto whispered to her, &quot;Its about time you showed 
up. I was begining to think I was stuck here...&quot;

But the girl didn&#39;t respond. He gaze was still locked inside the room. 
Makoto looked at her, then tapped her on the shoulder and gasped when 
her hand went straight thru the small girl.

Makoto then heard a man yell from in the room and the child jumped 
back in surprise. It was the king who had yelled. His tome suggested 
he was very angry...but also upset and sad. Makoto could see the 
slightest hint of tears in the old man&#39;s eyes. The smaller man spoke 
in a clam voice, as the king slid into a chair, bowing his head. After 
a few moments, the king nodded. The man in white bowed in respect then 
came walking slowly towards the doors. Makoto jumped back, and hid 
behind the door as it opened, forgeting all about the girl. 

When the door had closed, Makoto could see the small girl had hidden 
behind a pedstal, that was holding a rather expensive vase. The small 
girl then opened the door back up and walked ino the room, Makoto 
following suit. She now realized, even after being told, that no one 
could see her. 

The child walked up to the man and layed her head in his lap. Looking 
up, Makoto seen she had been right about the tears, for now they were 
streaming down his face. Picking the small child up, the king cradeled 
her in his massive arms.

&quot;That was our father during the Silver Millenium,&quot; came a small voice 
behind her.

Makoto spun around to see the castle had vanished, to be replaced by 
the mist once again. Her former self, Chibi-Mako once again stood 
before her. 

&quot;What had happed to him? Why was he crying,&quot; Makoto asked.

Chibi-Mako bowed her head and sighed. &quot;Its a long story...You see, our 
mother died when we were very young. Younger than what I am now. She 
died a Senshi.&quot;

&quot;A what?&quot;

&quot;A sailor Senshi...She was Sailor Jupiter. She died in the line of 
duty, protecting the queen of the moon, Serenity, shortly after we 
were born.&quot;

&quot;What does that have to do with the king crying?&quot;

&quot;The man that was with Father, he was a messanger for the moon 
kingdom. I was called up to take my mother&#39;s place. All the princess&#39; 
from all the planets have been. The time had come for our Senshi 
training.&quot;

&quot;Why were we so young when called,&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;For preperation mostly. We didnt leave for the moon until we were 
between the ages of nine and ten. Thats everyone.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;What else am I going to see here? I know there is 
more.&quot;

&quot;Hai..there is,&quot; Chibi-Mako started, &quot;But i won&#39;t be the one to show 
you.&quot;

Makoto looked at her. &quot;If not you, then who?&quot;

&quot;Me,&quot; Came a voice behind them. Makoto spun around and there stood 
another incarnation of her at age 14 or so...she stood in a senshi 
fuku; skirt and cape green, her bow was pink. 

&quot;Who are you,&quot; Makoto asked, already knowing the answer. 

&quot;I&#39;m you. Age 15,&quot; she replied. &quot;I am known as Sailor Jupiter.&quot;

Makoto nodded and turned back around, to find Chibi-Mako was gone. 
Spinning back around, she asked, &quot;Where did she go??&quot;

&quot;Back into your memory. We both can&#39;t exsist at the same time in your 
mind,&quot; Jupiter explained.

&quot;Oh...&quot;

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Makoto looked up and then nodded. &quot;Close your eyes,&quot; 
Jupiter whispered.

Makoto closed her eyes once again, feeling that same light surround 
her once more. She felt light head, when she opened her eyes again.

She looked around her, the mist gone, to be replaced by a garden of 
white roses. Makoto looked around and all she could see were roses. 
She looked up and noticed the sky was black, tinkeling with stars. But 
something told her it was day and not night. Looking behind her, but 
still up at the sky, Makoto saw the earth and imediatly figured out 
she was on the moon now.

Hearing screams behind her, she turned and walked toward them, a large 
marble palace coming into veiw. She could see people running from it 
and this caused Makoto to run toward the palace, forgetting she could 
not help if there was danger.

Luckily, there wasn&#39;t. Just a group of girls playing a game. Makoto 
smiled and breathed a sigh of releif and was about to turn when she 
realized who they were.

Looking at them once more, she saw one girl, with long raven colored 
hair to be Rei; the one with short blue hair as Ami; smiling, she saw 
herself, and then Usagi, who had a cresent moon on her forhead. She 
then caught sight of another blonde, who didn&#39;t seem to have changed 
from her memory of her.

Minako.

~But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new~

She had never chnged, although the others seemed to have. Rei didn&#39;t 
seem as nasty towards Usagi anymore. Ami and herself seemed to have 
been very close for they were playing a game of chess that had set up 
after running out side. Usagi seemed wise for her age, and more 
graceful than she had ever seen her before. And Minako...

Minako seemed to still be a bit of an airhead, but still smart for her 
age. She sat with Usagi and Rei, making most of the jokes and talking. 
The other two didn&#39;;t seem to mind.

Makoto smiled at them all, even tho she had no idea what they were 
saying still. The language they spoke, although seemed familiar to 
her, also seemed alien at the same time.

What seemed like hours to Makoto was only a mere few minutes to the 
dream world. No sooner had Makoto sat down to watch her memories 
replay them selves had an alarm went off somewhere with in the Palace. 
The girls looked up at the alarm, to one another then nodded. And, for 
the first time since being in the dream, she could understand her 
memories language.

&quot;MERCURY POWER MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;MARS POWER MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;JUPITER POWER MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;VENUS POWER MAKE UP!&quot;

After bright flashes of differnt colors of light, Makoto opened her 
eyes to see thay had al lchanged into senshi except Usagi. The senshi 
escorted her inside, and as Makoto was about to follow, something 
seemed to have struck her in the back of the head, making everything 
go black.

~Though I know I&#39;ll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I&#39;ll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more~

Makoto woke up, and when she did, she noticed the palace was now in 
ruin. Looking around franticly. she knowticed everything was 
destroyed. And the moon seemed darker than it had before.

She walked around the rubble, trying to figure out what happened, but 
there were no clues. Everyone seemed to have disappeared, there was 
nothing there but what was left of the palace.

&quot;Sad, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Makoto spun around and saw a woman standing before her who looked to 
be what Usagi would like like when she was older. Gazing up at her, 
Makoto noticed she had the same cresent moon shape on her forhead she 
had seen Usagi wearing.

&quot;Who are you,&quot; Makoto asked, feeling she should know this person, but 
didn&#39;t know why. &quot;And what happeend here?&quot;

&quot;My name is Queen Serenity,&quot; the woman said. &quot;And this,&quot; she siad, 
gestureing withher hand,&quot; is what is left of the Moon Kingdom and the 
Silver Millenium.&quot;

Makoto blinked and looked at her. &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;It was destoyed, by an evil Queen,&quot; Serenity said, a hint of sadness 
in her voice. &quot;She desroyed what I refused to give her.&quot;

&quot;Where is everybody,&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;They were killed in the blast.&quot;

Makoto blinked. &quot;...Everyone?&quot; The Queen nodded. &quot;Well..you&#39;re 
here...so not everyone...died....&quot; Makoto stopped in midsentence. 
&quot;You&#39;re part of my memory, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Hai, I am,&quot; The Queen said. 

&quot;Is there a reason you&#39;re showing me this?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Hia, there is.&quot; Serenity stepped up to Makoto, the palm of her hand 
mere inches from Makoto&#39;s forhead. Serenity&#39;s hand began to glow 
slightly. Makoto could feel a burning sensation in the middle of her 
forhead, before there was a blinding green and white light...


Makoto groaned slightly, somewhere in the back of her mind she could 
hear a beeping noise. Her mind was flooded with images she had seen in 
her dreams. 

She felt something next to her, and tightened her grip on it. It was 
her new henishen stick. Tightening her grip on it, she felt it 
disappear. Before panicing, however, she heard the Queen&#39;s voice in 
her mind.

*You&#39;re Sailor Jupiter, Makoto. You henishen stick will be ready for 
when you need it.&quot;

Makoto mentally nodded and opened her eyes. She felt pain course thru 
her body as she felt her sore muscles move. Turning her head slightly, 
she saw a blonde standing by the window. She was wearing a look of 
shock. Makoto wondered why..then remebered the car.

She tried to sit up, but since her body seemed to have frozen in 
place, Makoto smiled weakly at Minako(she recognized her by her red 
bow) and waved slightly...

~Though I know I&#39;ll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I&#39;ll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more~ </pre>
