<h1>Come into My Chamber (part 4 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Milady, the hunters!&quot; A sharp shrill scream echoed across the 
corridors, and the voice was cut of rather violently.

She heard the splatter of blood.

And she waited for the hunter to come.

She saw the glow of the unearthly blade before she saw its wielder, and 
she smiled softly.
 
&quot;Such a pleasure to have you here. Shall you bring down the flames of 
Hell to destroy my children, dark hunter?&quot;
 
The hunter gave a soft, low chuckle. &quot;Perhaps God himself will one day 
send fire down upon you and your Undead servants, beautiful little 
Queen. As for me, I&#146;ll settle with just letting my blade tear through 
your neck.&quot;
 
The child, woman, Queen smiled. &quot;We will see...&quot;
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
...dum veneris judicare saeculum per ignem...
...and you shall come to judge the world by fire...
 
There she was. Just sitting there on an examination table as if she had 
not been killed a day ago. Ami took a deep breath. Then two deep 
breaths. Alivealivealivealivealive, the thought rattled in her head, and 
she bit down a short, insane giggle. Alive...how is she alive? I 
checked...kept checking....she was well-respected...I didn&#146;t want her to 
die...who did? I kept checking...she was...is dead. Clinically dead...how is 
she sitting, how was she screaming for help a second ago? Makoto turned 
to the blue-haired woman, and Ami suddenly felt sick with terror. Makoto 
frowned, and Ami could hear the first glimmers of panic in her voice. 
&quot;Who are you? Why am I here?&quot; To Ami, the voice sounded oddly strained 
and tired. Whatever Makoto Kino had seen, dead or otherwise, must have 
truly rattled her brain. The doctor was then struck with a notion, which 
strangely, did not seem insane at all in the moment. Maybe she saw God? 
And whoever, the angels or something...she took another look at the 
brunette. She saw skin devoid of color, dark green eyes shining...no 
glowing.
 
And she knew  it was not the work of God, or any angel.
 
&quot;Miss Kino,&quot; she said, trying to keep her voice from trembling, &quot;it&#146;s 
very cold in here. How about we get out of here, and I&#146;ll give you a bit 
of a check up? How does that sound?&quot; Makoto cocked her head. Why is she 
talking to me like I&#146;m a puppy? She shrugged, and Ami half-expected her 
skin to come off her shoulders and curl to the floor. &quot;Sure,&quot; the 
brunette said, and Ami inwardly sighed in relief. At least she&#146;s 
docile...that means she&#146;s not a zombie...my brain would have been her lunch 
by now. She resisted the urge to scream and laugh all at once...
 
====================
 
Minako would kill the bastard today. Drag his body outside the apartment 
and rip him to shreds...she frowned. She&#146;d just scare the hell out of 
him, make him wish he had never moved in with the girl...Tenshi. That was 
her pet name for her...it was slightly insane, obsessive, but she really 
didn&#146;t care anymore. Maybe she&#146;d find out her name soon...as for now...she 
turned into mist once more, and entered the apartment.
 
And then she heard breathing.
 
Very loud breathing.
 
She turned. What in the hell? What was he, a werewolf? She smiled at 
that. When was the last time she had seen a werewolf? She shrugged. &quot;I 
didn&#146;t know my Tenshi could sleep with snorers.&quot; She heard a growl. &quot;Did 
I hit a nerve? Oh..&quot; she pretended to pout, &quot;I bet she complains. You 
should really get that breathing checked, hon. Someone as pretty as my 
Tenshi should be able to get her beauty sleep.&quot; She heard a low growl 
again...this time it sounded like a snarl. Minako blinked. She was 
beginning to think this person was a werewolf. Before she could explore 
this manner further however, she was attacked.
 
By a rather large dog.
 
She had been talking a dog.
 
A fucking dog.
 
She kicked the beast off of her, and turned into mist again, leaving 
through the keyhole again. She gasped. The stupid thing had almost torn 
her face off. She had worried for nothing. The &#145;boyfriend&#146; was nothing 
but a guard dog. She sighed, shook out her blonde hair, and waited for 
her Tenshi to arrive home. She was definitely not taking a chance back 
in that apartment. She really hated dogs...
 
====================

The soft chime of the door alerted the woman, shook her from her 
daydreaming. &quot;Welcome..&quot; she murmured, yawning and stretching, &quot;I&#146;m 
afraid we&#146;re closed.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#146;m not here to buy anything, ma&#146;am. I&#146;m Detective Rei Hino. I have a 
few questions to ask you.&quot;
 
The woman&#146;s hands clenched into fists, and then she relaxed. &quot;...I see. 
Who sent you?&quot;
 
Rei coughed. &quot;She told me to keep that information classified. Um...can 
you turn on a light? It&#146;s way too dark for me to see.&quot;
 
In the darkness, the woman smirked, and flipped a light switch near her 
desk. The room lit up in soft, golden light, and Rei looked around. This 
is certainly a weird shop, she thought. She gazed around. Weapons were 
scattered everywhere. Swords of every size, nuchuckus, 
daggers...crossbows. 
 
Rei rose an eyebrow. &quot;Interesting place you have here...&quot;
 
The woman smirked. &quot;Collectors,&quot; she explained, and Rei turned to look 
at her.
 
Like Usagi, this woman was also wearing black...but Rei noted that she was 
not quite as pale as the other woman. The woman&#146;s black hair was pinned 
up, and she had allowed a few tendrils free to frame her face. Jade, 
almond-shaped eyes, speckled with gold, peeked out from long, sooty 
eyelashes. The woman held herself regally...Rei suspected she had been in 
a boarding school more than once in her life. She was tall and slender, 
but the black turtleneck she was wearing accentuated the fact that she 
was athletic. A silver chain hung from her neck as well, and an angel 
wing amulet hung from it. She stood, and walked over to the detective.
 
&quot;And what, may I ask, are the questions you have for me?&quot; Her voice was 
soft, but not gentle, melodious, but not at all musical. For some odd 
reason, Rei was reminded of a schoolteacher.
 
&quot;Um...well, I assume you&#146;ve heard about the murders? And your name is 
Kazuki, right?&quot; 
 
The woman snorted. &quot;Of course I&#146;ve heard about the murders, and yes, 
that is my name. What are you getting at?&quot;
 
Rei sighed. &quot;Listen lady, I heard you know about what&#146;s happening here. 
Usually, I wouldn&#146;t make a blind shot like this, but it&#146;s really 
starting to get dangerous. People are afraid to go out at night.&quot; 
 
Kazuki chuckled softly. &quot;Is that so? So let&#146;s see Detective...you came 
here in hopes of finding a weapon small enough to make those puncture 
wounds. I don&#146;t doubt that I have one like that. And a customer might 
have purchased something like it.&quot;
 
Rei&#146;s eyes lit up. &quot;So we might have a lead?&quot;
 
Kazuki smirked. &quot;Yes, you might have a lead...if those were puncture 
wounds. They are not. They are...how do you say...bite marks.&quot;
 
Rei gawked at her. Bite marks? This lady is insane. &quot;Um...I really doubt&#151;&quot; 
Kazuki cut her off.
 
&quot;You don&#146;t believe me? Let&#146;s see...the attacks are only at night. And 
there are many people killed in one night, not just one or two. Oh, and 
they all have these tiny little marks on the side of their necks...&quot;
 
&quot;...and let&#146;s not forget all of the blood is sucked out of them. You may 
be shocked by what I know about this case, but believe me detective, 
there is not much that happens in this world that I don&#146;t know about. 
Your problem is not a serial killer. Tokyo has vampire problems.&quot;
 
Rei stared at the woman in disbelief, and shook her head. &quot;You&#146;re 
insane. There&#146;s no such thing as vampires.&quot;
 
Kazuki grinned, but it did not seem like a grin at all. &quot;You&#146;d be 
surprised...&quot;
 
Rei blanched. &quot;Um...G&#146;night...&quot;
 
Kazuki shook her head. She certainly is a bit rock headed...won&#146;t see a 
truth that is right in front of her. 
 
&quot;Goodnight Detective. I do hope you solve your case...&quot;
 
=====================
 
No vital signs. No blood, nothing. She had sat there for hours checking 
again, and again, and again. There was no way she could be living. She 
had no heartbeat, no pulse...nothing.
 
Makoto groaned, and Ami jumped slightly.
 
The brunette frowned at the blue-haired woman. &quot;I&#146;m starving...&quot;

Ami blinked. &quot;What?&quot;
 
Makoto sighed. &quot;I said I&#146;m hungry. And I&#146;m cold. Do you have anything 
here that will fit me?&quot;
 
Ami blinked, and then blushed. &quot;Oh yes! That&#146;s right, you&#146;re um...and...I&#146;ll 
find something!&quot;
 
Makoto shrugged, and felt a sliver of pain pass through her stomach. 
&quot;Can you hurry please? I&#146;m starving.&quot;
 
Ami nodded, turned a corner, and shot to the phone...
 
=====================
 
&quot;Did you speak to her...?&quot;
 
Rei jumped, and turned to see Usagi. &quot;How&#146;d you sneak up on me like 
that?&quot; she asked, slowing down her pace so that the blonde woman could 
catch up.
 
Usagi smiled. &quot;That is a secret, I&#146;m afraid. Did you talk to Kazuki?&quot; 
Rei frowned, and shrugged, her cheeks slightly pink from the cold air. 
&quot;Yeah...she&#146;s a loon.&quot;

Usagi laughed. &quot;What did she tell you?&quot;
 
Rei shrugged. &quot;Something about vampires...&quot;
 
Usagi smiled, and in a instant, she was next to Rei, her breath teasing 
the nape of her neck. &quot;she may be right..&quot; she murmured, her breath 
brushing against the detective&#146;s earlobe. 
 
Rei gasped, and turned around.
 
The blonde was nowhere to be found.
 
It suddenly became much colder...
 
=====================
 
Setsuna sighed and turned to the girl at her side. &quot;Hotaru...where is 
Milady Queen?&quot; The teenager shrugged, blowing a few strands of black 
hair from her face. &quot;No idea...she said she&#146;d be out for a moment.&quot; 
Setsuna sighed again. &quot;And where is Minako?&quot; The girl shrugged again. 
&quot;No idea...why?&quot; Setsuna rolled her eyes. &quot;Minako is in trouble, and I 
have to report it to the Queen, who is not here.&quot; Hotaru laughed, and 
her lilac eyes flashed mischievously. &quot;When did you become a tattletale, 
Setsuna?&quot; Setsuna turned to the small girl, and gave her a grim smile. 
&quot;When Minako decided to slaughter 5 people in one night without any 
reason.&quot; Hotaru gasped. &quot;Minako-chan? Why would she...&quot; Setsuna rolled her 
eyes. &quot;She&#146;s in love.&quot;
 
&quot;Again?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, God...not again...&quot;
 
====================
 
Her angel was finally home...Minako smiled. She looked worn out, and her 
hair was a mess. Oh, how Minako wished she could gently run her fingers 
through her tenshi&#146;s mane of white hair, massage her shoulders to relax 
her. She sighed. It was never to be, she supposed. She would have to 
stay content with watching her. She heard her angel&#146;s soft, tired voice 
from the window. She called that monster dog Fenrir, and it barked 
happily, following its owner around the apartment. Minako caught the 
last snippet of the conversation, and she smiled.
 
&quot;Fenrir, let&#146;s go for a walk, okay?&quot;
 
The dog barked happily, and Minako grinned. She had been attacked by a 
dog, and she was probably going to be in a large amount of trouble when 
her Queen found out what happened to those people, but she was happy 
just as long as she could see that beautiful woman, her angel...
 
====================
 
&quot;Makoto Kino is ALIVE, Detective. I swear on everything I love, she&#146;s 
talking and moving around, but she has no pulse, nothing! She&#146;s dead, 
but she&#146;s alive...you have to hurry and get here, please&#151;&quot; Rei turned the 
message off, and put on her coat to head to the morgue.
 
Was it just her, or was everyone insane today?
