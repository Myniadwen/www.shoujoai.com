Rei let out a yawn and opened her lavender eyes. She smiled faintly as 
she was greeted by the beautiful vision of Usagi sleeping next to her, 
the angel&#39;s blonde head resting on her chest. So last night hadn&#39;t just 
been a wonderful dream after all. Rei sighed deeply, watching her 
princess&#39;s head rise and then fall gently with her breath. The Fire 
Senshi had never felt more content in all her life. Things were *right*, 
finally. She had been through Hell; she had experienced torment that 
most beings would have withered and died enduring... but not her. She 
had endured, and in enduring, grown strong. Rei had faced the trials 
thrown at her by Fate, and she had not been found wanting. The Senshi of 
Fire had proven worthy and had won her true love&#39;s heart. As if there 
could have been any doubt of the eventual outcome.

Rei reached up with her left hand and tenderly caressed Usagi&#39;s soft 
cheek, being careful to not wake the sleeping beauty. The miko felt her 
heart swell with rapturous joy. The lovely girl was all hers now, even 
if there hadn&#39;t been any declarations of undying love between them yet. 
Mamoru, the prince, was finished. Rei had no doubt that Usagi would 
break up with the man as soon as possible, perhaps even this very day. 
The raven-haired girl couldn&#39;t help but smile smugly at the thought. The 
poor guy didn&#39;t know what the hell was coming. Rei had stolen his 
girlfriend from right under his nose. Served Mamoru right anyway, he 
hadn&#146;t appreciated what a magnificent person he had by his side. Or 
*had* had by his side.

The Fire Senshi delicately brushed her fingers through Usagi&#39;s golden 
bangs, enjoying how the silky strands felt on her skin. All hers. Unable 
to resist any longer, Rei angled her head downwards and placed her lips 
on the blonde&#39;s forehead, kissing her only love softly. Usagi wriggled 
slightly beside Rei, and then her pretty blue eyes gradually fluttered 
open, disorientation appearing in them for a second. The blonde girl 
then gave a satisfied smile, her location and company returning to her 
sleep-addled mind.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Rei said quietly, continuing to soothingly run her 
fingers through her princess&#39;s hair. &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t wake you.&quot;

&quot;Mmm, no... I have to get up soon, anyway,&quot; Usagi mumbled peacefully as 
she cuddled up against her senshi&#39;s naked form, rearranging her body for 
a moment before relaxing in the raven-haired girl&#39;s embrace once more.

&quot;No you don&#39;t, I want you to stay here with me,&quot; Rei said with a gentle 
smile, tightening the hold on her lover with her right arm.

&quot;Hmm... it&#39;s tempting, I ache in places I never knew existed, but I have 
school today,&quot; Usagi replied, slowly closing her eyes and starting to 
doze.

The miko let out a light laugh. &quot;Yeah, my body&#39;s sore too,&quot; she 
confessed.

Usagi merely mumbled something unintelligible in response and slung one 
leg over her bodyguard&#39;s, before resuming her snoozing. Rei felt a 
small, slightly coarse patch of hair brush up against her thigh, 
delighting in the sensation. The raven-haired girl grinned a little 
lecherously, remembering last night&#39;s... pleasurable, activities. She 
could still smell her princess on her hands and on the bed, and only had 
to lick her lips to taste her lover again. Rei glanced down at the 
wrinkled bed covers. They had better change the soiled sheets before 
Usagi&#39;s mother saw them. Though, the Fire Senshi supposed, one only had 
to take a whiff of the lingering scent in the room to know what her and 
Usagi had been up to last night. After a quick survey of the bedroom, 
Rei saw that Luna was nowhere to be found. Good. She didn&#146;t want the 
interfering cat spoiling her mood.

Rei eyelids began to drift shut, the sounds of her princess&#39;s 
methodical, relaxed breathing lulling her back into a peaceful slumber. 
Suddenly, the miko was rudely snapped completely awake as Usagi&#39;s alarm 
clock started ringing loudly, the noisy bell probably necessary to get 
her rather lazy princess out of bed. The blonde odango atama quickly 
reached for her clock, fumbling a bit before stopping the disturbing 
sound. Rei&#146;s ears were still ringing.

&quot;Ohhhh, it&#39;s too early!&quot; Usagi whined, returning to her bodyguard&#39;s side 
and snuggling deeply into the raven-haired girl, burying her face in her 
senshi&#39;s ample chest, most likely trying to escape the ringing in her 
own ears but gratifying her lover with the action.

&quot;Thank the gods I don&#39;t have to get up,&quot; Rei remarked, more to herself 
than to her true love.

&quot;Ohh no, you&#39;re getting up too,&quot; Usagi said, raising her head to look at 
her bodyguard with bleary eyes.

&quot;Why? I don&#39;t have to go to school...&quot; the miko argued, arranging her 
arms around the blonde&#39;s back and pulling the girl gently on top of her.

&quot;You *have* to come down to breakfast with me, Rei,&quot; the odango atama 
said. &quot;My parents are starting to think that you dropped out of high 
school. What if they tell your Grandpa? Or what if they say you can&#39;t 
stay here anymore...?&quot; Usagi finished in a small voice.

Rei frowned. She hadn&#39;t thought about it that way. If her Grandpa found 
out about how much school his granddaughter had missed recently, she was 
going to get the chewing out of a lifetime. Plus if her true love&#39;s 
parents ejected her from their house, Rei would miss Usagi terribly. The 
Fire Senshi had gotten used to waking up every morning and going to bed 
every night with her princess lying next to her. And with recent 
developments, the mornings and nights should be even more... appealing.

&quot;Okay, my princess,&quot; Rei conceded, smiling warmly at her lover, &quot;it 
looks like I&#39;ll be having breakfast with you for once.&quot;

Usagi met her senshi&#39;s smile with one of her own, and then leaned 
forward and kissed the girl tenderly on the lips for several moments in 
thanks.

&quot;But you&#39;re right; it&#39;s too early. However, I think we can find 
something to do to pass the time...&quot; Rei said slyly with a roguish grin, 
manoeuvring her thigh into an intimate position between Usagi&#39;s legs.

However, to the miko&#39;s disappointment, the blonde let out an exasperated 
sigh and rolled off of her bodyguard, flopping over onto her back. 
&quot;Geez, Rei, is that all you ever think about?&quot; she complained lightly. 
&quot;You are such a nympho.&quot;

Rei blinked at her princess, a little stunned. Where had her sweet love 
learned that word? Most likely from Minako, Rei guessed with some 
irritation. &quot;Me? If anybody&#39;s a &#39;nympho&#39;, it&#39;s you! You just couldn&#39;t 
get enough last night!&quot; the miko threw back. &quot;The whole neighbourhood 
probably heard your moans!&quot;

Usagi spluttered for a couple of seconds, her indignant response trying 
to force it&#39;s way out of her mouth in a jumble of words. &quot;What?!&quot; she 
finally cried in disbelief. &quot;That&#39;s because you wouldn&#39;t let me have a 
break! I&#39;m not the one who turned into some crazy vampire!&quot; the blonde 
said, poking a pointed finger at the collection of love bites on her 
neck.

&quot;Oh yeah, you *really* hated that,&quot; Rei said sarcastically, rolling over 
onto her side and propping herself up on one elbow, facing her princess. 
She then smiled suggestively, practically leering at Usagi. &quot;Speaking of 
which; let me see my handy work.&quot;

The odango atama raised her chin, exposing more of her throat to her 
bodyguard&#39;s gaze. &quot;See? I don&#39;t think I even have enough make-up to 
cover them all,&quot; she sulked.

&quot;I meant the other ones,&quot; Rei purred, reaching out a hand to stroke one 
of Usagi&#146;s legs.

Usagi looked at her lover for a moment, and then reddened, remembering 
just where the &#39;other ones&#39; were. Seeing her apprehension, Rei pouted at 
the girl prettily. &quot;Please...&quot; she pleaded with lots of exaggeration for 
Usagi&#39;s benefit. &quot;It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen everything...&quot;

Unable to resist her senshi&#39;s puppy dog expression, Usagi slowly raised 
the bed covers, giving the raven-haired girl a visual treat. Rei wet her 
suddenly dry lips, a small sultry grin coming to her face as she took in 
her lover&#39;s once perfect skin, the smooth flesh in between her legs now 
graced with many red circles. The miko gently trailed her fingertips 
along her true love&#39;s thigh until she reached the marks. With a delicate 
touch, she lovingly traced one love bite, putting light pressure on it.

&quot;They sting...&quot; Usagi whined softly, blinking moistly at her tender 
inner thighs.

&quot;Mmm, I&#39;m sorry, my princess,&quot; Rei said apologetically while she 
caressed the red patches. &quot;I guess I went a little overboard.&quot;

Usagi shrugged where she lay, watching her bodyguard&#39;s hand intently as 
it moved between her legs. &quot;It&#39;s okay; I should have known you&#39;d be 
mean,&quot; she sighed in mock resignation, before glancing discreetly up at 
Rei, waiting to see her reaction.

The Senshi of Fire abruptly stopped fingering Usagi&#39;s love bites and 
looked at the girl, scoffing. But before she could make a witty retort, 
the miko heard a muffled shout from downstairs come through Usagi&#39;s 
closed bedroom door. &quot;Breakfast is nearly ready! Everyone, it&#39;s time to 
get up!&quot; Ikuko&#39;s voice called.

Rei and Usagi groaned in unison and let their heads collapse onto the 
pillow. Both girls lay still for a moment, merely staring into one 
another&#39;s eyes as they heard the rest of Usagi&#39;s family rise and shine 
under Ikuko&#39;s command. The blonde sighed and moved forward, brushing her 
lips against her senshi&#39;s and giving the raven-haired girl a light peck. 
She then rolled over and got off the bed, staggering slightly.

&quot;I guess that&#39;s our cue to get up, Rei,&quot; Usagi said while she stumbled 
about on unsteady legs around the bed, searching for her discarded 
pyjamas from last night. &quot;Come on lazy bones, get up before someone 
comes in to see what&#39;s taking us so long.&quot;

Rei turned onto her back and stretched her arms and legs, flexing her 
aching muscles. She let out a breath and watched her true love with 
half-lidded eyes as the naked girl tried to pull on her pink pyjama 
bottoms, her lithe figure moving delightfully. The miko smirked and then 
put on what she thought was a charming smile.

&quot;You know, there&#39;s still time for a &#39;quickie&#39;,&quot; she suggested casually.

Usagi let her pyjama bottoms drop to her ankles and bent down to the 
floor, no doubt to remove the garment once again. Rei&#39;s smile got wider 
with rising hope... until the blue towel she had worn the previous night 
flew at her face. The Fire Senshi made a disappointed sound as the bath 
towel covered her head.

******

After a cold shower to cool the ecchi impulses inside of her, Rei 
returned to Usagi&#39;s bedroom clad in a yellow towel, making sure Shingo 
wasn&#39;t spying on her before she made the walk there. The little hentai 
had been doing that nearly ever since she had come to stay at the 
Tsukino house. Rei quickly entered her princess&#39;s room and shut the door 
behind her with a click. She saw that Usagi was standing in front of a 
mirror already dressed in her school uniform, having had a shower before 
her senshi, while she fiddled with a small pink scarf hanging around her 
neck, attempting to hide the evidence of her passionate activities. Rei 
spared her lover an indulgent smile and then moved towards her bag by 
the dressing table. She stopped when she noticed that the blonde had 
taken the liberty of placing her school uniform on the now clean and 
made bed.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Rei said over her shoulder to her princess, receiving an 
absent mumble in reply from the occupied girl.

Rei dressed herself in her Catholic school uniform, and then picked up 
her book bag from the floor, before dropping it on the bed. She turned 
and saw Usagi rearrange the scarf around her neck for the hundredth 
time, the odango atama looking at herself from every angle she could in 
the mirror, most likely trying to see if any red marks were noticeable. 
Rei sniggered a little and sauntered over to stand behind the beautiful 
girl, snaking her arms around the blonde&#39;s slim waist.

&quot;How does this look?&quot; Usagi asked her bodyguard, shifting the pale pink 
scarf about her throat slightly. &quot;Can you see anything?&quot;

Rei shook her head as she looked at her princess&#39;s reflection in the 
mirror. &quot;Nope. But it&#39;s pretty obvious you&#39;re trying to hide something,&quot; 
she said truthfully.

Usagi moaned in despair and moved to take off the scarf, but her lover 
quickly grabbed her wrist, forestalling the action. &quot;It looks fine,&quot; the 
miko murmured in assurance. &quot;No one will notice anything.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Usagi asked uncertainly. &quot;I wish these uniforms had 
higher collars...&quot; she grumbled to herself, picking at her clothes.

Rei let go off her only love&#39;s wrist and returned her arm to its former 
position around the blonde&#39;s waist. She hugged Usagi gently and rested 
her head on her princess&#39;s shoulder, gazing into the angel&#39;s blue eyes 
in the mirror. &quot;Yes, it looks fine,&quot; she repeated in a comforting voice.

Usagi leaned back into her bodyguard&#39;s embrace and covered the 
raven-haired girl&#39;s hands with her own. &quot;I wish I didn&#39;t have school 
today,&quot; she said wistfully, lightly rubbing Rei&#39;s hands on her stomach 
with her thumbs. &quot;I wanted us to go out and do something together.&quot;

&quot;We still can,&quot; Rei said, taking a moment to inhale Usagi&#146;s pleasant 
perfume. &quot;I&#39;ll meet you after school; we can have lunch together.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Usagi said happily, nodding in acceptance.

The Fire Senshi smiled faintly and then carefully lifted her true love&#39;s 
scarf a little, exposing her red neck. Usagi squirmed in Rei&#39;s arms with 
apprehension. &quot;I don&#39;t think-&quot; she started, but was silenced when her 
bodyguard made a mild hushing sound.

Rei very gently placed her soft lips against the blonde&#39;s neck, causing 
the girl to tense at the contact. The miko began to slowly rain soothing 
kisses on her lover&#39;s sore flesh, while she massaged the girl&#39;s flat 
stomach in small circles with her hands, Usagi&#39;s own moving with them. 
Rei&#39;s touch coaxed her princess&#39;s muscles back into a relaxed state and 
the blonde let out a low whimper, shutting her eyes.

Suddenly, the bedroom door burst open, making Usagi&#39;s eyes pop open 
again. &quot;Hey, you have to-&quot; Chibi-Usa&#39;s voice cut off abruptly as Usagi 
swiftly jumped out of Rei&#39;s embrace, pressing against the mirror as if 
in an attempt to distance herself from her senshi and appear innocent.

Chibi-Usa stood stock still in the doorway, silent and staring at the 
two girls with wide crimson eyes. Usagi merely stared back with equally 
wide eyes, frozen against the mirror. Rei was in no better state, her 
arms still locked in position, like her princess was still in her grasp.

&quot;W-W-We were just, ahh... umm... getting ready for school!&quot; Usagi 
blurted out all of sudden, plastering a fake smile on her face. &quot;Right, 
Rei?&quot; she urged, the girl saying her lover&#39;s name in a higher pitch than 
normal.

Rei glanced at Usagi, her petrified condition broken by the sound of her 
true love&#39;s voice, and then looked back at Chibi-Usa. &quot;Uh, right. I was 
only... eh...&quot; She trailed off, starting to flounder as she tried to 
think up an excuse for what she had been doing to the child&#39;s future 
mother. Rei didn&#39;t know exactly why she was trying to lie about her 
actions to Chibi-Usa, but simply followed Usagi&#39;s lead. &quot;I was only 
helping her adjust her new scarf!&quot; the miko said after a short pause, 
inspiration striking her.

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right. So we should... go eat breakfast now! Let&#39;s go, 
Rei,&quot; Usagi said hurriedly, before grabbing her book bag from the floor 
and brushing past Chibi-Usa, gesturing wildly behind the child&#39;s back 
for the Senshi of Fire to follow. Rei readily obeyed the blonde, 
retrieving her book bag from the bed before she left.

Rei and Usagi went downstairs and into the kitchen, sitting down at the 
dining table across from Shingo and Ikuko rather breathlessly. A couple 
of seconds afterwards, Chibi-Usa came down, seeming somewhat subdued, 
and sat beside Usagi&#39;s little brother.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to see you joining us for breakfast, Rei,&quot; Ikuko smiled 
warmly at the miko, placing a plate down in front of the girl.

&quot;Oh, well, I had to go back to school eventually; I&#39;m in perfect health 
now,&quot; the Fire Senshi replied, giving a weak chuckle.

Rei reached out for some toast at the same time Usagi did, causing their 
hands to brush together for a brief period. The blonde&#39;s cheeks flushed 
and she quickly grabbed a slice of toast, shoving it in her mouth, 
hoping the food would hide her blush. Rei swallowed and took a slice as 
well, and then nibbled on it delicately, her gaze locked on the wooden 
surface of the table in front of her. She risked a glance at Chibi-Usa 
out of the corner of her eye, and saw that the young girl was looking 
directly at her. In fact, it felt like everyone was looking at her, 
Kenji included, even though the man was reading a newspaper at the head 
of the table. Rei gulped a little nervously and found it difficult to 
chew down her dry toast.

&quot;Did everyone sleep well last night?&quot; Rei heard Ikuko ask 
conversationally.

There was a rustle of paper from the head of the table, and the Fire 
Senshi heard Usagi&#39;s father cough. To the right of her, just in her 
field of view, Rei saw Usagi slouch lower in her chair, perhaps wishing 
to make herself small and less noticeable.

&quot;No!&quot; Shinjo said sharply in an irritated tone. &quot;Usagi and Rei were up 
nearly all night fighting or something! They kept waking me up!&quot; Maybe 
Usagi&#39;s idea of sinking low into her seat wasn&#39;t such a bad idea at this 
point.

&quot;What about you, Usagi, dear?&quot; Ikuko said, ignoring her son&#39;s annoyed 
outburst.

&quot;M-Me? L-Like a log,&quot; the odango atama stammered out, idly touching the 
pink scarf that hid her love bites from the night before. She snatched 
up her glass of milk and took a long draft, once again obscuring her 
reddening face from her mother&#39;s view.

&quot;Hmm. And you, Rei?&quot; Ikuko&#39;s inquisition continued.

Rei raised her head slowly to look at the woman. She met Ikuko&#39;s knowing 
eyes and suddenly, a disturbing revelation dawned on her: Usagi&#39;s mother 
knew. Rei&#39;s face paled. Everyone *was* looking at her. They all must 
have heard what she and her princess had been up to the night before. It 
shouldn&#39;t have been surprising; the two girls had been loud enough to 
wake the dead. But the miko had somehow never actually believed that 
they would hear, even though it would have taken a miracle for them not 
to. Rei had thought everything would be as it had always been with the 
Tsukino family- everyone totally oblivious and not a word being said 
about the noise coming from Usagi&#39;s bedroom. Gods, what a mistake *that* 
had been.

&quot;I slept okay...&quot; Rei croaked out, and then hastily averted her gaze, 
finding it difficult to now look Usagi&#39;s mother in the eye with her new 
understanding.

Ikuko was quiet for a while, and everyone at the dining table busied 
themselves with the task of eating breakfast, though the tension in the 
air was evident. Rei gradually let out the breath she had been holding. 
It looked like nothing was going to be said after all. The miko gave a 
silent prayer to the gods in thanks. While the raven-haired girl wanted 
her relationship with Usagi public knowledge, she wasn&#39;t quite ready to 
be confronted by the blonde&#39;s parents just yet. The fact that they knew 
she had &#39;defiled&#39; their first born in their very own house, in their 
daughter&#39;s very own room, was enough to for her to handle right now.

&quot;Usagi, are you a lesbian?&quot; Ikuko asked bluntly out of nowhere, 
shattering the tense silence.

Usagi coughed and choked on the milk she had been drinking, some of the 
liquid coming out of her nose. Rei quickly slapped her lover on the back 
several times, helping to clear her lungs, the action more out of reflex 
than anything else as the Fire Senshi&#39;s brain shorted out.

&quot;I mean, it&#39;s all right if you are,&quot; Usagi&#39;s mother went on casually. 
Meanwhile a larger newspaper had suddenly replaced Kenji, the man&#39;s 
fingers curling around the paper&#39;s edges the only sign that he was still 
at the table.

&quot;Mom, I-I&#39;m not-&quot; the blonde odango atama forced out while wiping her 
face with a napkin.

&quot;Oh. Are you bisexual then? Is that the right term? You should have told 
me Rei was your girlfriend, honey,&quot; Ikuko continued unabashedly as her 
daughter&#39;s face turned beet red, Rei swiftly following suit. Wasn&#39;t it 
funny how the ground never rose up to swallow you when you wanted it to?

&quot;*Rei&#39;s* Usagi&#39;s *girlfriend*??&quot; Shingo said, dumbfounded. &quot;Ohhh! This 
is sooo unfair!&quot; he whined, collapsing back in his seat, his dreams of 
dating Rei destroyed. The boy&#39;s head then snapped upright as a thought 
struck him. &quot;But Mamoru&#39;s your boyfriend; I&#39;ve saw you with that guy,&quot; 
he said, and then abruptly stabbed a pointed finger at his mortified 
sister. &quot;You can&#39;t have a boyfriend *and* a girlfriend! It&#39;s not fair!!&quot;

&quot;Now Shingo, Mamoru is probably just a fake boyfriend, to cover up your 
sister&#39;s real relationship with Rei, isn&#39;t that right? Oh honey, you 
should know you don&#39;t have to hide something like this from me or your 
father; you can talk to us about anything,&quot; Ikuko said in a voice full 
of compassion. If the woman had any compassion, she would shut up this 
instant.

&quot;No, M-M-Mamoru is my-&quot; Usagi stuttered, her face ablaze, but was 
promptly cut off by her mother&#39;s gasp of shock.

Ikuko covered her mouth with one hand for a moment. &quot;Oh dear. You, 
Mamoru, and Rei aren&#39;t in a... in a... in a *threesome*, are you??&quot; she 
whispered, but loudly enough so everyone at the dining table could still 
hear her. Rei&#39;s princess looked like she just wanted the world to end 
right now. &quot;But it&#39;s alright if you are!&quot; Usagi&#39;s mother assured her 
daughter hastily. &quot;It won&#39;t change how your father or I feel about you. 
We&#39;ll always love you, no matter what your choices.&quot;

&quot;We are *not* in a threesome,&quot; Rei said firmly, managing to gather the 
tattered pieces of her mind together at the mention of her bitter, but 
defeated, rival and her ever being romantically involved.

&quot;Oh! That *is* a relief!&quot; Ikuko sighed deeply, placing a hand over her 
heart. &quot;So what *is* going on?&quot;

&quot;W-Well, y-you see...&quot; Usagi started. You could practically see the heat 
haze around the girl&#39;s tomato red cheeks. &quot;Rei and... a-and I... I... I 
have to go to school! Gotta get there early today for, um, a test! Yes, 
I have a test! Can&#39;t be late! Bye!!&quot; she babbled nearly incoherently, 
jumping up from her chair. The blonde leaned down to Rei as if to kiss 
her bodyguard goodbye and then glanced at her mother, the odango atama&#39;s 
face becoming even more flushed, if that were possible, as her frazzled 
brain realised just where she was at the moment. She flashed Rei an 
apologetic look before bolting like a rocket for the front door of the 
house.

&quot;Uh, yeah, I gotta get going to, you know, school... where I learn... 
how to do... stuff,&quot; Shingo said lamely, just what his older sister and 
her best friend were actually doing last night that was so noisy dawning 
on the boy. It was better if he vacated the premises immediately. After 
sparing an apprehensive glance at Ikuko, he ran from the dining table in 
a split second, leaving fluttering paper napkins behind him.

Rei looked over to where Kenji had been sitting, the newspaper still 
blocking the man from view. The gust of wind from Shingo&#39;s speedy 
departure disturbed the newspaper barrier, and it collapsed to the 
floor, revealing an empty chair and an elaborate prop made out of 
toasted bread crusts. The miko&#39;s head quickly snapped to where Chibi-Usa 
was seated, the child strangely quiet, only to find the pink-haired girl 
had alreadly slipped away in all the confusion. Rei was alone with... oh 
no.

Rei slowly creaked her head around, meeting Ikuko&#39;s pleasant and 
understanding smile. The Senshi of Fire weighed her chances of simply 
running like hell. Maybe she could use a diversion, like the old &#39;what&#39;s 
that behind you?!&#39; routine, or maybe she could pick up Kenji&#39;s discarded 
newspaper and throw it up in the air, using the pages as a form of 
smokescreen to cover her escape. Perhaps diving out the window wasn&#39;t 
entirely out of the question either. The glass couldn&#39;t be that thick. 
Or maybe-

&quot;Rei, we&#39;ve never really talked,&quot; Ikuko said, with a hint of emphasis on 
the word &#39;talked&#39;. Rei knew what the woman wanted to talk about, or 
rather, grill her about. Ikuko had just recently found out that the miko 
was Usagi&#39;s girlfriend, that her daughter was a lesbian, or at the very 
least, had homosexual tendencies and that Rei was her lover. There could 
be only one thing Usagi&#39;s mother wanted to talk about. Oh gods, there 
wasn&#39;t any escape, was there?!

&quot;Eep,&quot; Rei squeaked.

To be continued...


Author&#39;s ramblings:

This chapter was meant to have other stuff in it, but the things at 
Usagi&#39;s house just seemed to drag on and I thought I&#39;d just post it as 
it is. Oh well, a little more happiness before angst filled goodness I 
suppose. ^_^</pre>
