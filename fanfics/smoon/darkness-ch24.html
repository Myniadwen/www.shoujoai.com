Finally the cord snapped, all control was lost?Serena was pissed and no 
one was going to stop her from seeking her revenge. The revenge? The one 
thing she&#39;s been saying since she was a child, and that was to kill 
Darien.

Serena slowly stood to her feet, her eyes completely black, with specks 
of red embedded within them. The sharp pearly white fangs of hers were 
exposed. She held an angry expression, growling deep within her throat 
every so often. Her breathing was coming out raggedly, her chest heaving 
quickly.

She straightened up fully, looking around the room, everyone stared at 
her in shock and amazement. She turned away from them, walking towards 
the door to look for Darien. Many of the slayers jumped out of their 
stupor, realizing where this crazed vampire was going.

So they did the only thing the could think of and that was to stop the 
girl and kill her. About fifty slayers ran after Serena, with stakes 
held high, ready to slay the vampire, as  others stood back, knowing not 
to test the teen. The other vampires that were watching were moving 
forward, ready to stop these idiotic slayers.

Artemis grunted, telling them not to get into this. That this was 
Serena&#39;s fight and that she would handle this. They all stepped back 
unwillingly, curiously watching the teen to see what she was going to 
do.  Serena slowly walked towards the door that would lead her to 
Darien, until she was knocked down from behind. Being piled on and being 
pounded on by the slayers.

The vampires watched intently, thinking the worst of the young vampire, 
that is until they all heard an inhuman growl. Then they saw slayers 
being sent flying in all directions. They turned back to Serena and saw 
the annoyed look on her face. Her hands clenching and unclenching.

Some of the slayers ran towards the girl, ready to strike her once 
again. One man held a stake and tried to stab Serena in the heart, but 
Serena caught his hands. Adding pressure to her grip, crushed the 
slayer&#39;s hand to pieces. The Slayer let out a blood curdling scream, 
then passed out when she ripped his arm out of its socket. 

Another slayer came up from behind her, ready to ram the stake into her 
back, but she un-expectantly whipped around, smacking the man with the 
arm she had just ripped off some one. The slayer flew into a wall, 
leaving a cracked wall behind him, as he hit the floor with a loud thud.

Another slayer ran up to her, as fast as he could, with a sword held 
high in his hands. He then swiped his sword downwards towards her head 
to slice her in half. The man let out a startled yelp when she caught 
the blade about an inch above her head.

He looked into her eyes, and felt a cold shudder run through him. He 
gulped, knowing that this was his end. Serena grinned at him, which 
didn&#39;t console him at all. She twisted the blade quickly, making him 
loose his hold. She flipped the blade so that she was holding the 
handle.

The man took one step back, before Serena swiped the sword down. The man 
looked at her in shock, eyes wide, before his body split in two from his 
head down. His body split and fell on either side. She smiled, then 
looked up at the other slayers who dared to attack her and to delay her 
time with Darien, with amusement and excitement burning  in her eyes.

They began to tremble and took several steps back. This caused her to 
grin, gripping her sword tighter. Quicker than a blink of an eye, she 
was in front of those very slayers. She took her sword, slicing and 
dicing them into pieces.  Her breathing was a little on even, as she saw 
the blood spraying and the body parts dropping onto the floor.

She looked up towards the vampires and saw the horrified expressions on 
their faces. She looked over to Rei, and saw the fear she held in her 
eyes, the fear pointed towards her. A pang of pain jolted her heart, and 
her eyes began to turn silver, but she shook her head, making them turn 
back the it&#39;s creepy color.

She quickly turned away from them, advancing towards the door she had 
originally planned on going through before she was rudely interrupted. 
Rei starred after her lover, she had seen the eyes change and it was 
because of her.

She pushed her way past Luna who was holding her back from Serena, and 
moved a few steps towards her girlfriend. &quot;Serena!,&quot;

The teen stopped and turned towards the girl, she looked at her?then 
dropped the sword she held in her hand and walked towards her in slow 
steady strides.  She stopped in front of her lover, and felt the girl 
stiffen in fear. Serena raised a hand and caressed Rei&#39;s cheek tenderly. 
Rei just starred into Serena&#39;s eyes, not believing how much they&#39;ve 
changed and how scary they looked.

Rei moved closer to Serena, wrapping her arms tightly around her, 
&quot;Serena?please?lets just go home,&quot; Serena was nuzzling her face in the 
girl&#39;s hair and neck, she moved back and lightly pecked Rei on the lips.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I cant,&quot;

&quot;Why!? I don&#39;t want to loose you Serena, I&#39;ll die without you, 
please?just come home,&quot; 

Serena looked into Rei&#39;s eyes, on which she was trying to avoid. She saw 
the tears roll down her flushed cheeks. She used a finger and whipped 
them away tenderly.

&quot;I can&#39;t, I have to finish this once and for all?you wont loose me, I 
promise,&quot; She pecked Rei on the lips one more time, before she roughly 
pushed her lover back, the raven haired girl stumbling back, but was 
caught by Luna before she hit the floor. &quot;I have to go?don&#39;t follow me,&quot; 
With that, Serena ran off down the hallway ready to kill this slayer and 
then go home with Rei. Rei watched as her lover ran off and sighed. She 
couldn&#39;t hold her lover back for  what she had dreamed of doing since 
she was a child. So she just had to let her go and do what she had to 
do, no matter the consequences.

**************

Serena walked down the halls, busting open every door that she could to 
see if Darien was hiding in there. Finally she came up to the last door 
that was in this building, and the only door she hadn&#39;t tried to open. 
Serena stared at the door, before she turned the knob, surprised that it 
was unlocked.

She stepped inside, to see that it was very dim inside the rather small 
room. She looked around with her eyes, which soon stopped as she spotted 
Darien standing in front of the window, arms crossed behind him. He 
slowly turned around, as Serena slammed the door behind her. 

Darien smiled, bringing his hands out in front of him, clasping them 
together, &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you,&quot;

Serena growled, &quot;Cut the small talk and lets get this over with,&quot; 

Darien grinned, taking a step closer, &quot;As you wish,&quot;

They both crouched down in fighting stances, &quot;You know you look 
different,&quot;

&quot;Shut up!,&quot; growled Serena, as she charged forward, starting off their 
hand to hand combat.  Serena took her left fist, swinging it towards 
Darien&#39;s face. Darien dodged, throwing a shot of his own with his fist. 
Serena caught his fist, taking it and twisting and yanking him close to 
her, holding his arm behind him, leaning back slightly, causing him to 
grunt in pain. 

She brought her lips to his ear, &quot;I&#39;m going to make you suffer?you&#39;re 
going to wish that I kill you quickly,&quot;

Darien growled under his breath, taking his foot, putting it behind him, 
and putting it behind one of Serena&#39;s legs. He leaned back, pushing her 
foot up, making them loose balance and fall to the floor backwards.

Darien quickly rolled off of Serena, and then turned to her, brining his 
fist down to hit her in the face, but she rolled over, barely missing 
the blow. She swung her leg towards him, knocking Darien&#39;s feet from 
underneath him. He fell, and rolled on to his stomach and began to 
stand. 

He was pushed back down towards the floor when Serena ran into him. 
Serena flipped him over, pounding her fists into his face. She smiled 
with satisfaction, hearing the loud crack of his nose breaking, but that 
didn&#39;t stop her from keeping her onslaught of punches. 

Darien grabbed Serena&#39;s fist&#39;s before they could hit him again, he 
quickly sat up, head budding Serena in the face, causing her forehead to 
split. She shot back, holding her head, rolling off of him. Darien 
quickly got to his feet, taking on the advantage of her being on the 
floor.

He ran up to her, kicking her in the ribs. He grinned hearing her yelp 
in pain and hearing the satisfied cracks of her ribs breaking. He didn&#39;t 
notice the blood trailing down from his nose, entering in his mouth, as 
he was too involved in kicking the poor vampire girl.

Darien then decided to kick where ever he could instead of aiming at one 
spot. So, he started kicking her face, head, back ?.anything exposed, he 
attacked violently.

Serena turned over and saw as Darien foot was coming towards her again. 
So she reached out and grabbed it, then sank her teeth in to his leg, 
ripping out a chunk of meat. Darien screamed dropping to the floor and 
cradling his badly bleeding leg. She grinned, but then coughed up some 
blood. She groaned, holding her ribs.

Darien looked at the girl with wide eyes, starring at her as if she was 
some sort of monster, &quot;You freaking bit me.  What the hell is wrong with 
you?!,&quot;

Serena grinned, chuckling softly, trying to climb to her feet. Darien 
growled in outrage, jumping to his feet unsteadily, &quot; I don&#39;t see 
anything funny about this,&quot; and then he charged at her. She moved just 
before he would have ran into her and she watched as he ran into a wall.

She crouched down, doubling over in pain as it soar through her entire 
body.  Darien dropped to the floor, then turned to the side and saw a 
small dagger beside him that he had in his pocket earlier. He grabbed it 
and then looked over at Serena&#39;s doubled over self.

He grinned, gripping the dagger in his hand. He slowly go to his feet, 
then ran towards Serena. She slowly turned around, only to feel a sharp 
piercing pain in her abdomen. She let out a gurgling gasp, coughing and 
choking up blood. 

She stumbled back, holding the dagger that was embedded inside her. 
Darien grinned watching the girl. She pulled out the dagger slowly, 
wincing at the pain it caused.   Darien stared at her in surprise, 
expecting her to topple over or something.

Once the blade was pulled out, she looked down at the blood covered  
blade, examining it closely. She then looked at Darien, her anger rising 
considerably. She gripped the dagger and threw it at him. He tried to 
dodge but it caught him in the shoulder. He shouted in pain, grabbing 
onto his wounded shoulder. He looked back to Serena and saw her walking 
over to him. She raised her foot, ignoring the pain, and kicked him in 
the stomach as hard as she could.

He flew back, hitting the wall with full force. He slid to the floor, 
and watched as Serena walked over to him, grabbing him by his foot. She 
looked at him, then grabbed the heel of his  foot and the top and 
twisted it, breaking his ankle with a loud &#39;pop&#39;. He shouted out in 
pain, but she ignored him, grabbing on to his other foot, going through 
the same procedure.

She then slowly stood up, after breaking every bone in his legs and 
feet. She grabbed him by the throat, raising him about an inch off the 
floor. She gripped his neck tightly, coldly staring into his eyes, with 
such anger.

&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to do this, to kill you. Ever since I was a little 
girl, when you took my father away. You&#39;ve caused me such pain through 
out the years and it&#39;s going to end now!,&quot; exclaimed Serena, as she 
clenched her hold around Darien&#39;s neck, wanting to watch as he struggled 
to breathe.

He dug his nails into Serena&#39;s hands and wrists, hoping it would loosen 
her grip, but to no avail. He gagged, desperately trying to gain some 
oxygen inside his starving lungs. He felt darkness consuming him, but 
then Serena loosened her grip, letting him breathe again. He looked at 
her confused, but then gasped when she clenched her hand around his 
throat again.

She played this game for about 15 min?watching as the man squirmed 
within her grasps.  She used her other hand and took a hold of the 
dagger that was in Darien&#39;s shoulder. She began to twist it around, 
causing him to scream in pain and agony. Finally she ripped out the 
dagger from his shoulder, letting the tip run around his throat and 
chest, making same cuts here and there.

She smiled, looking at the fear in his eyes, &quot;Nice knowing you Darien,&quot; 
with the, she plunged the dagger into his chest,  burring it in deep, 
twisting it around in his chest. She then let go of the dagger, watching 
as the man slid to the floor. She looked at him momentarily, before 
walking away from the dead body.

She slowly walked her way back towards where everyone was at, waiting to 
see what the outcome of the battle was.  She came towards the door, 
seeing Rei, then collapsed to her knees. Rei grinned, tears of joy 
rolling down her face.

She ran to her lover, crouching down in front of her. She saw Serena&#39;s 
wounds and became worried. She wrapped her arms around Serena, pulling 
the girl close to her. She, laid her head on Rei&#39;s shoulder, while Rei 
pulled her into her lap. 

Rei placed her hand on her girlfriends bleeding abdomen, trying to 
control the blood flow. She looked into Serena&#39;s eyes seeing that they 
were back to their normal gorgeous silver color.

&quot;I told you I would come back,&quot; whispered Serena, wincing when Rei put 
more pressure on her wound. With her other hand, wiped some of the blood 
off her girlfriend&#39;s face.

&quot;I knew you would,&quot; she said, kissing her on the lips lightly. 

&quot;Can we go home now?,&quot;

&quot;Yea of course,&quot; 

Rei helped her lover to her feet, having her girlfriend lean most of her 
weight onto her. She held her tightly, walking down the trail the 
vampires and the left over slayers had made. Serena glared at the 
slayers, hatred burning in her eyes.

&quot;If any of you mess with me or anyone that I care about?consider 
yourself being my personal punching bag,&quot; growled Serena, before they 
continued  their way out of the door, followed with the rest of the 
vampires.
