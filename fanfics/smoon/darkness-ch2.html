<h1>Darkness (part 2 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The aqua haired girl smiled down at us as the other girl glared. The 
three people began talking quietly as we continued our walk. Soon we 
made it to a truck and he told us to climb in. Me and my brothers were 
weary at first but than we climbed in.

I had some trouble getting in the truck but then the girl that glared 
at us picked me up and placed me in the truck. Once we were seated, 
all of us just sat quietly throughout the whole ride.

I was really fidgety during the ride, I was so hungry. I looked at my 
brothers who were sitting behind me. They looked as though they were 
in the same state as me, but were in more control of themselves. I 
turned herself myself around and began looking over the appearance of 
the three adults.

The one to my left that had the aqua hair and matching eyes. Her hair 
was wavy and the length was up to her shoulders. She wore a black 
shirt with a black trench coat over it. When she stood up the length 
was a little past her knees. She had on tight black leather pants with 
black leather boots.

I looked to my right at the women with short sandy blonde hair and 
green eyes. She wore a black tank top with a black button up shirt 
over it. The buttons were all open and she had on blackish blue jeans. 
She also wore all black Nikes.

I then looked to the front were the man sat as he drove the truck. He 
had white long hair and a tight blackish purple muscle shirt. He also 
had on baggy leather type pants and black boots. &#39;Wow these people 
really like dark colors&#39;, I thought.

I turned my attention back to Michelle who was now staring at me. I 
smiled slightly at her as my fangs hung out into view.

&quot;So kid, what your name.&quot;, asked the nice lady.

&quot;My name is Serena. What&#39;s yours?&quot;, I asked. The women smiled back 
before replying.

&quot;My name is Michelle, The one to your right is Amara and the one up 
front is Artemis.&quot;, replied Michelle.

&quot;Are they your brothers?&quot;, asked Michelle. I looked back at my 
brothers and found them asleep. I looked back at Michelle and nodded 
my head yes.

&quot;The one with black hair is Jet and the one with goldish colored hair 
is Tray&quot;, I replied.

&quot;Where are your parents?&quot;, Amara suddenly asked. I looked up at her 
and then my eyes went blank in remembrance.

&quot;They&#39;re dead. People with pointy sticks stabbed my daddy. And I don&#39;t 
know what happened to mommy because she told me and my brothers to run 
so we didn&#39;t have to watch.&quot;,said Serena with a sudden hatred burning 
in her eyes.

&quot;But I will avenge their deaths. Maybe not now or tomorrow, but 
someday I will make them feel my wrath.&quot;, said Serena with venom 
edging in her voice. Artemis looked through the review mirror of the 
truck in surprise. He never expected her to say something like that.

When he first laid eyes on those three kids he felt that their was 
something special about them, especially the girl. Amara and Michelle 
looked down at the little girl in shock and respect. At that point 
they knew that there was something different about her.

Serena began looking down at my hands which were shaking 
uncontrollably. She never felt this hungry before and it felt like she 
was going to explode. She felt something warm on my hands and she 
looked down. It was another pair of hands. Serena looked up to see the 
warm eyes of Michelle looking at her.

&quot;I know your hungry. Well get you something to eat, okay.&quot;, she said 
with a smile. I beamed up at her with a smile at the mention of food.

&quot;Were going to get some pigs blood?&quot;, I asked. The aqua haired girl&#39;s 
smile slowly faded as she looked at me in confusion.

&quot;Pigs blood?&quot;, she asked. I nodded my head which made my hair bounce 
slightly.

&quot;Yeah of course. My mommy made pigs for us to eat. But know she can&#39;t 
make it for us anymore&quot;, I said with my eyes showing my sadness.

&quot;You drink pigs blood, that&#39;s just wrong.&quot;, exclaimed Artemis with 
disgust showing on his face.

&quot;You mean, that you three have never drank human blood, ever.&quot;, asked 
Amara with a bewildered look in her eyes.

&quot;My mommy won&#39;t let us drink human blood. Maybe it&#39;s because she&#39;s 
human, but we&#39;ve been drinking pigs blood since we were born.&quot;, said 
Serena

&quot;Well that&#39;s going to change. Your with us know and we have to teach 
you something&#146;s to survive as a vampire.&quot;, said Artemis.

&quot;And we got to get you out of those clothes.&quot;, said Amara while making 
a disgusted look at my pink flower dress. I nodded my head as we 
pulled into some kind of underground layer. Amara shook Jet and Tray 
awake as we began to make our way out of the car.

Michelle picked me up and carried me inside as Amara picked up Jet and 
Artemis picked up Tray. When we were inside we saw vampires all over 
the place. Me and my brother&#39;s had never seen another vampire before 
except for dad, so it was a huge shock to us. We were shocked when we 
saw Artemis, but hundreds of vampires in one place. That&#39;s just to 
much to handle.

We were brought into a room and were put on a bed. Artemis, Michelle 
and Amara left to bring us some things. I looked at my brother&#39;s who 
were a sleep again, and I followed suit. I laid down and closed my 
eyes and let sleep consume me.</pre>
