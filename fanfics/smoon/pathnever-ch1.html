<p>“It was my own choice.”</p>
<p>“I’m won’t  let you fall.”</p>
<p>The promise of eternity was renewed, enter  destiny.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV</u></p>
<p>The  deadly silence is coming, its very being threatened the future of  this fragile planet. To prevent this, my partner and I must find  three magical talismans that lie dormant within the pure hearts of  three special people. Somewhere, they are somewhere in this  overcrowded city.</p>
<p>I took refuge under the shade  of a large oak tree, or to be more exact, I sat on one of its sturdy  branches. My stress melts away as I sit here, enjoying the soothing  cool breeze of the wind. There was a special bond between the wind  and I, it existed even before I had learnt that I was the senshi of  the wind, Sailor Uranus. Sweat caked itself onto my short blonde  strands as the wind cooled the droplets. I had only been running  moments before. Although I was the track team’s the star runner I  was required to practice everyday…Even in this inhumane heat. I  would’ve cursed but the peaceful ambiance once again lulled me into  a content state, my eyes watching lazily as the green leaves shifted  steadily. They only made soft noises.</p>
<p>My  concentration was broken when I heard the shouts of sprinters  beginning their drills. Running…At one point in my life I wished to  be fast as the wind. It was before I tried to escape my destiny,  before I met <strong>her</strong>.</p>
<p>She should be done art  class any minute now. I pulled myself up to stand on the tree branch.  A trickle of sweat ran down the side of my face. Well, there was one  way to cool down quickly and I can’t let her see me in my messy  state.</p>
<p>“Take deep breaths.” I told myself.  “ichi…ha…ni…ha…sa-” I became too controlling of my  breathing and caused some air to go down the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>Cough!  Cough!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My one of my hands grabbed my throat for support  as my eyes started to tear. I coughed a bit more while my free hand  felt for balance on the oak’s main bark. Finally my breathing went  back to normal and the pain had passed. I hope no one saw that. My  hopes faded when I heard someone giggling and I knew only one person  with that polite giggle.</p>
<p>“So where’s san?” Came the  amused voice.</p>
<p>“Michiru…”</p>
<p>The aqua haired goddess  stood beneath the tall oak. When our met I saw mischief dancing in  her aqua eyes, perhaps she’s a good mood? I inspected her quickly,  nothing out of the ordinary. The usual Mugen Gakuen girls’  uniform, the reddish-brown long sleeve shirt, accompanied by the  green striped, skirt and neatly tied bow. Ugh, those skirts look so  uncomfortable, especially out in this weather. I felt myself wince  and continued to stare longer, frowning slightly in thought. That was  when another desired cool wind hit the tree, sending a second wave of  lush leaves sprawling aimlessly downwards. The leaves framed  Michiru’s face so perfectly; her hair imitated the ocean’s waves  themselves as those aqua locks embraced the wind. The sea senshi  closed her eyes and smiled when she felt the wind tug at her shoulder  length hair…So beautiful.</p>
<p>My once comfortable track-wear,  consisting of my favorite gold tank top and shorts started to feel  very uncomfortable. My body fidgeted slightly. If I hadn’t been  worrying about my nervousness I would have noticed that ever so  slowly I was leaning further and further forward off of the branch I  stood on.</p>
<p>“Haruka?”</p>
<p>My eyes blinked quickly as my  mind snapped back to reality. Was I staring? My face turned a bright  shade of red and I was sure it wasn’t from the running this time.</p>
<p>“Is there something on my face?” Michiru questioned, her  hand was already brushing against her fair skin, checking her cheeks  for anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“Nani…? Ah! No! No, it’s  just…” Michiru looked up, waiting for my explanation.</p>
<p>Think of an excuse, fast! One glance down and my eyes fell  upon a piece of paper slightly hanging out of the scrapbook Michiru  held in one of her hands. Bingo.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t quite see  that work of art.” I attempted with a smooth voice.</p>
<p>Michiru  looked down at what I brought her attention to and pulled out the  piece of paper with care.</p>
<p>“This? But Haruka, it’s just a  plain piece of paper.” She giggled.</p>
<p>“Ah…well.” I could  feel myself panic, since when have I never had anything to say?  Comebacks were my specialty, that made me feel a little better but  this situation was something different.</p>
<p>“You know, it was  very difficult to see from up here and you could never tell right?  But it probably doesn’t matter because anything you make is a work  of art.” I rambled quickly.</p>
<p>She merely took the  compliment and smiled to my relief.</p>
<p>“Well, why don’t you  come down silly?”</p>
<p>Eh? My eyes stared at the branch I had  been standing on the entire time. That’s right, I was still in the  tree. It was embarrassing how I needed to be reminded of these minor  details sometimes.</p>
<p>“But it’s cool up here.” I felt  myself sulk. Being up here made me feel like I could do anything…  Even saving the world. You see things you normally wouldn’t see  when you look down at the world from a different view. Besides, it <strong>was</strong> cooler up here.</p>
<p>“Well you sure don’t look like  it. Your face is flushed!”</p>
<p>“W-well, you know, from the  running and all…”:</p>
<p>“No buts. I can’t let my partner  faint from heat stroke or whatever before we save the world.”</p>
<p>Was  it really safe for her to talk like this out in the open? For a  moment I examined the environment. Good, it didn’t seem like anyone  was within earshot.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to faint from a little  heat stroke, they’re nothing to me!” Striking a pose, I rested my  arms resting on my hips, then turned my head slightly to the side and  showed off a confident smile. I could hear Michiru sigh, her  footsteps came closer stopping short of the tree’s trunk. Was she  going to sit down? I opened one of my dark green eyes, curious to see  her reaction. Staring back up at me with her arms crossed, her aqua  blues were threatening me to come down that instant or she’d do  something I’d regret.</p>
<p>“Tenoh Haruka!”</p>
<p>“All  right, all right…” I chuckled.</p>
<p>Teasing Michiru always  gave me a pleasure although I wasn’t sure why. Sometimes she would  seem so stressed out about our mission, playing eerie sad songs on  her violin. It pained me to see her like that, if I could get her to  smile or laugh even once in awhile it was enough. Maybe, once it’s  all over I’ll be able to keep her smiling. What an odd feeling this  was. We’re just friends, partners in battle at the most. So why am  I feeling like this? What is this emotion?</p>
<p>My mind was  wandering again, slowly losing consciousness of my balance. The cool  breeze doubled back full force this time.</p>
<p>“Haruka!”</p>
<p>Ah!  My reflexes were slower than my mind for once. I’m going to  fall!</p>
<p>“Oof!”</p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p>As my mind reeled  in confusion there were only two things that I knew for sure. The  pain in my body wasn’t nearly as bad as I expected it to be and I  had landed on something…Soft. Soft? The ground was never this soft  as far as I could remember. My heart was racing so fast. I paused for  a moment and listened attentively. As I listened closer and held my  breath I realized it wasn’t my heart racing that I heard.</p>
<p>“Haruka, could you please get off? It’s hard to  breathe.”</p>
<p>My head shot up, startled to see Michiru’s eyes  looking directly back into my own. Saying we were close would be an  understatement. I had fallen on top of her as she couched my  fall.</p>
<p>“Oh! Gomen ne Michiru!”</p>
<p>I jumped off of her  and extended my hand to pull her up. She took it, I couldn’t help  but notice that her hands are very soft…As she preceded to brush  off the extra leaves and grass that clung to her uniform I bent down  to retrieve her scrapbook.</p>
<p>“Domo arigato, Haruka.” She  thanked as I handed her the book.</p>
<p>“…Gomen nasai. I didn’t  really mean to fall on you. Daijobu des ka?”</p>
<p>“Hai, no  worries Haruka.”</p>
<p>Something inside scolded myself. After  seeing Michiru in many battles against our enemies I should know that  she was a strong person, that this incident wouldn’t effect her  much. Still a part of me saw her as fragile. A foolish thought  perhaps but I had this desire to protect her.</p>
<p>“Shall we get  something to eat now?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ano… All right. I totally  forgot that I was starving! Lemme go shower and change, I’ll be  right back, I promise.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV</u></p>
<p>Haruka  has been acting strangely lately, I wonder why? She isn’t usually  so clumsy, I mean how often does she fall out of a tree! As I recall  just before the incident she had this spacious look on her face…I  almost had a heart attack when she started to  fall.</p>
<p><strong>Tsing.</strong></p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>My vision  dulled, darkness wrapped itself around my being. Everything was dark,  only darkness. Another vision, they always started like this. What  was going to happen now? I’ve had so many of late, my nightmares of  the world’s destruction, the future if Haruka and I failed. My body  went felt cold, leaning towards numbness. If we failed… There was  so much at stake and at times I wanted to fall to my knees, buckling  under the pressure. Let myself go, let myself fall. But I couldn’t, <strong>she</strong> won’t let me, so I cannot. I can only fight to win.</p>
<p>My  face felt submerged under the freshness of a cool wave. How I needed  that. What did you need to show me? The ocean roared in my ears,  coming and retreating with the tide.</p>
<p><strong>Ping.</strong></p>
<p>The  sound echoed into the darkness acting as the starting signal. A face  flashed before my eyes. As the image sharpened the figure could be  identified with greater clarity. The girl was younger than I was. Her  hair- raven black and quite long, it extended down her back. The  clothes she wore resembled a priestess. Perhaps she was a miko?  Something told me this was the next target and the events will take  place soon, but where? My eyes squinted slightly hoping to spot  something of the image to give me some sort of clue. Anything, it has  to be at near a shrine…There! An old wooden sign directly in the  background over the girl’s right shoulder read “Hikawa Shrine”.</p>
<p>Then that’s where we’ll go I felt myself  resolve.</p>
<p>I waited, standing motionless. Darkness rolled back  and the image faded. Patiently the reality I expected did not come  back to my annoyance. Aren’t you done yet?</p>
<p><strong>Ping.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>What  did this mean? Another vision? I don’t understand, I felt myself  think in shock. Never have there been two at once; the enemy couldn’t  possibly attack two separate targets simultaneously could they?</p>
<p>Then it came, the sound echoed once more and I saw…Aqua  eyes? Was I looking into a mirror? What the…My legs staggered back  into the darkness away from the image. Was this mockery? Rage and  confusion swelled inside my chest, the whole situation didn’t seem  logical. However the image persisted, it wouldn’t leave me be.  Those eyes looked so sad but why? Why did I feel compelled to look  away? It felt shameful not to be able to look the problem in the eye;  it made me feel like a coward. I gulped as I slowly brought my gaze  back up. The image did not expand further; this person’s eyes were  my only clue. Curses escaped silently under my breath. It’s  difficult to tell how much time passes in this state. No time must be  wasted!</p>
<p>“Haruka!” I screamed.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV</u></p>
<p>Without the sweat and grim my body felt good as new.  Or fresher at least. Michiru was still standing where I had left her  ten minutes ago but she had a distant look on her face.</p>
<p>“Michiru?”</p>
<p>She didn’t move as I closed the  distance between us.</p>
<p>“Michiru!” I started to run.</p>
<p>It  must be another vision. I hate it when they happen, it leaves a  person open and vulnerable.</p>
<p>“Michiru, wake up!”</p>
<p>My  hands shook her shoulders lightly. Come one, wake up Michiru. Looking  deeply into her eyes I saw disorientation and flickering of pain?  What was she seeing that hurt her so? A voice in the back of my head  answered my question for me, ‘what if it was the end of the  world?’. I hoped not, those nightmares were enough to drive Michiru  or myself into a depressive state for days at a time. I had one only  last week, and it…</p>
<p>What could I do to snap her  out of it? Think! Anything would do right now! My eyes searched her  face again. I hesitated at a thought but it looked like my only  option. In one motion I learned forward and pressed my lips pressed  against hers. They felt so soft. It hurt me to think that I was  enjoying myself while she is suffering in her trance-like state but I  was sure this was the most effective way to snap her back to  reality.</p>
<p>We stood like that for what seemed like an eternity.  I drew her smaller figure close and pressed our bodies together in an  embrace, hoping she’d feel my body heat. I didn’t care if anyone  saw us; it was my last concern. Please wake up Michiru. As if it was  on cue, Michiru’s eyes fluttered briefly.</p>
<p>“Mmff?”</p>
<p>My  eyes shot open when I had realized she was back to normal.</p>
<p>“Michiru!  You’re back! What was it? What did you see?”</p>
<p>“H-Haruka…?”</p>
<p>She  backed away immediately. My arms felt slightly disappointed that the  embrace had been broken, however, I masked the emotion from her.</p>
<p>“Michiru?”</p>
<p>She only stood there looking more  confused than ever. Was she going to yell at me? It didn’t occur to  me that she might be disgusted with my actions afterwards, the  possibility never occurred to me at the time. I was only concerned  about her safety. Quickly I broke the uneasy silence,</p>
<p>“Can’t  let my partner space out.” I joked.</p>
<p>Michiru only continued  to stare blankly at me.</p>
<p>“Ano…Are you ready to grab a bite  to eat? It’s getting a bit late and…”</p>
<p>“Time!” She  suddenly burst out.</p>
<p>“Time?” It definitely wasn’t the  response I was expecting. I looked down at my watch. “You want to  know the time or…?”</p>
<p>“No! Haruka, I saw it, the  target.”</p>
<p>I nodded my head, understanding what she had just  told me. The happy feeling was definitely gone.</p>
<p>“All  right…so got any idea who or where it is?”</p>
<p>“That’s the  problem, there are two!”</p>
<p>“Nani!” I could  feel my eyes widen.</p>
<p>“One is a raven-haired girl, a priestess  at the Hikawa Shrine. The other, I can’t say for sure.”</p>
<p>“Well…at  least we know where one is. What kind of clues did you find for the  other girl? Any on her appearance?”</p>
<p>There was another  pause. Michiru stood in front of me with her hands holding her chin  in a thoughtful stance.</p>
<p>Waiting for her opinion I  could only leave myself open for the doubts and worries that rooted  into my mind. Why were there two targets? There was no way that  Michiru could get dud visions, it was unthinkable. And if there were  really two…then it means we’d have to separate. I know we  promised each other if one of us dies that the other would continue  the mission but the thought was rejected by my feelings. How could I  let my partner go into a potentially dangerous situation alone? The  voice in the back of my head reminded me, ‘<em>she isn’t that  weak’</em>. You can never tell. The enemies are getting stronger by  the day! ‘<em>Maybe you’re the one who is weak, following Michiru  around like a lost puppy. Have you ever thought that your fa-‘</em> Urusai! I’ll show you!</p>
<p>“The ocean.” She responded,  ignoring my previous question. My mind snapped back. It took a few  seconds before my eyes re-focused on her’s once more.</p>
<p>“T-the  ocean?”</p>
<p>“I just…have this feeling Haruka.”</p>
<p>“Well  it’s simple then! I’ll head over to take the shrine and you take  the beach, most likely place it’ll happen right?”</p>
<p>“Haruka…”</p>
<p>I  knew that tone, it was the “your not thinking before you act”  one. How I knew that one well.</p>
<p>“It’s the best way Michi!  If there are two targets we have to cover them both!” I assured  her. “I’ll be fine, don’t worry! Ja ne!”</p>
<p>I sprinted  as fast as I could before she could protest any further. The truth  was I didn’t want to hang around much longer than I needed to, I  was still worried about what she thought about that kiss. Even I  didn’t know what to think of it. At least she woke up though. Her  lips were so sweet…<em>’You’re doing it again’</em>. Stupid  emotions!. I slapped myself harshly across my own face. After feeling  the stung of the blow my mind only thought of one thing, get to the  shrine!</p>
<p><strong>Brroom!</strong></p>
<p>The air soon rang  with the sound of a motorcycle making distance.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p>She left before I could say anything…It happened  so fast, the vision and that…Kiss, did that really happen? My hand  moved to touch my lips, the feeling of Haruka’s still lingered.  What am I supposed to think? A light blush covered my face. Did she  mean it? It took another minute before I had realized something else.  Did she just call me ‘Michi?’.</p>
<p>“Oh…I don’t have  time for this! Now I have to think, how am I going to get to the  ocean?” Anything to get my mind off of what happened. “Haruka  just took off…”</p>
<p><u>Beach area</u></p>
<p>The beach, the  slightly rocky sand burrowed itself deeply under my feet. I didn’t  bother to turn around, only listened to the public transport bus that  sauntered away noisily. Grr, next time I see Haruka we’re going to  have a talk about this, I swore. It wasn’t that I was angry with  the tall blonde, just rather annoyed from exhaustion. Haruka is  rather impulsive but for once I was glad that I followed one of her  ‘plans’.</p>
<p>The ocean was the one place I felt at peace  with myself, it was apart of me and I, a part of it. The same is  similar for Haruka and the wind I was sure, although Haruka would  never admit it. We are both partners and the world rested on our  shoulders. Now I stand here, waiting for the appearance of the person  who may carry one of the three magical talismans in their pure heart.  The feeling was not new but it made my stomach flip flop inside. To  take the talisman would mean killing the holder. Branded as murderer  and a savior at once, how ironic.</p>
<p>It used to be a pleasant  day, but now clouds gathered in the sky above. I hope this whole  business will pass soon, you could catch a cold in the approaching  weather. My school uniform wouldn’t provide much protection in a  storm either. Where was this person?</p>
<p><strong>Ping.</strong></p>
<p>It  was that familiar sound. My eyes were pulled towards one particular  spot in the dark, clouded sky. Suddenly the sky emitted a bright  flash of white light. My arms reached up instinctively to cover my  eyes, preventing myself to be temporarily blinded. Peeking cautiously  through a small space past my arm I could make out a figure falling,  twisting in a spiral like downwards motion from the concentrated pink  light towards the cold waters.</p>
<p>“What the…”</p>
<p>Unknowingly  to Michiru, <em>Destiny had just revealed its trump  card!</em></p>
