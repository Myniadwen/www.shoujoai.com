<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>The first rays of the sun crept through the quiet apartment. They made 
their ways to the two bodies on the couch. Lavender eyes fluttered open 
tiredly, looking around.

They fell on the small body nestled against her and a mop of black hair. 
The events of last night and the identity of the person struck her at 
the same time. Somehow, she managed not to move in fear of waking her 
friend.

Friend. Was that still right?

Yes, as friends they talked and cried last night.

But there was something new. Something... indescribable.

Mumbling came from the prone body half on top of her and half next to 
her. With an adoring smile, Rei took in the sight of a relaxed Hotaru 
Tomoe. She was beautiful.

The word brought back unwanted memories of last night. She didn&#39;t have 
enough energy to think about what had occurred and what Hotaru revealed 
to her.

&#39;Speaking of Hotaru,&#39; Rei thought suddenly, &#39;I should get her to her 
bed.&#39;

Carefully, the miko managed to stand without waking the dark haired 
youth. She then gathered the small body into her arms and headed for the 
guest room.

Once Hotaru was placed on the bed, Rei tucked her in.

&#39;So peaceful...&#39;

With a tired sigh and a goofy smile on her face, the miko walked towards 
the door.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

The woman turned back to the sleepy girl. With messy hair and barely 
open violet eyes, Hotaru looked too cute for words.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Are you going back to the couch?&quot;

Whoever thought Hotaru Tomoe had a habit of pouting? But the point was 
she did and she was certainly doing it now. The cuteness factor 
increased.

&quot;Yeah, I am.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot;

When Hotaru remained silent, Rei turned to leave. She was stopped when a 
quiet voice called her name again. Facing the girl in bed again, she 
discovered her moving over on the large bed. A hand lifted the covers.

&quot;Y-you can join me if you&#39;d like.&quot;

The offer was completely unexpected. Lavender eyes blinked several 
times, trying to decide whether or not she was hallucinating.

&quot;I mean, the couch is pretty hard and can&#39;t be THAT comfortable, despite 
the fact we fell asleep on it last night.&quot;

The college student was trying frantically to decide if it had been a 
bad choice asking Rei to join her. What had possessed her to do it in 
the first place? She had no idea whatsoever.

The miko approached the bed slowly, looking at the girl already 
occupying it.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

A nod and a sleepy smile were her responses. Hotaru shifted over some 
more when she felt the bed sink under the additional weight. As Rei 
settled in, they both tried to avoid touching the other. Despite the 
tension and hesitation they felt, it took no time at all for them to 
fall asleep.

Rei awoke to the all too familiar sensation of a warm body next to hers. 
She wondered why the hell she&#39;d be in bed with someone after that very 
interesting morning when Hotaru saw her... &#39;friend&#39;.

Her nose detected faintly the smell of vanilla and cherries. Only one 
person smelled like vanilla and cherries...

Hotaru.

Sleep disappeared from Rei&#39;s system as she looked down at the body 
pressed against hers.

Hotaru was lying on her side, one arm draped over her stomach while 
burying her face in Rei&#39;s shoulder. The miko had one arm around the 
frail girl&#39;s shoulders and the other resting on the hand on her stomach.

A blush tainted the pale cheeks. This position was not at all new or 
unusual for her. But with Hotaru, it felt so...

Comfortable. And right. Never had she felt so relaxed in someone&#39;s arms. 
The warm body beside her made her feel all... fuzzy... inside. She 
felt... safe.

A murmur informed Rei of Hotaru&#39;s waking. Quickly, she closed her eyes 
and timed her breathing. Better let her guest move. She didn&#39;t want to.

Hotaru snuggled closer to the body next to her.

Wait. BODY next to her?

Violet eyes snapped open. Rei was holding her close against the miko&#39;s 
body, a strong arm wrapped around her own petite waist.

Oh god! How did THIS happen? Sleeping in the same bed was so stupid!

And comfortable. She couldn&#39;t deny it. It felt very good to just lie in 
her arms and cuddle against Rei&#39;s warm body.

But she loved Minako and Usagi.

&#39;She&#39;s asleep,&#39; Hotaru thought with a smile. &#39;She&#39;ll never know.&#39;

Feeling brave and perhaps a bit stupid, the small girl raised her head 
and rested it on the miko&#39;s chest. She could fear her heart beating...

Rei was shocked when Hotaru didn&#39;t move away but got closer. The 
jet-black locks tickled her nose and neck, the feeling almost too much 
to bear.

&quot;Why do you love them so?&quot;

The breathless whisper was enough to shut down the miko&#39;s mind, and if 
she hadn&#39;t caught herself in time, her mouth would&#39;ve opened in 
disbelief.

Hotaru sighed softly. Might as well ask, even if she won&#39;t receive an 
answer. She&#39;d wanted to for so long now...

&quot;What did they do to deserve your love? Why do you love them after 
they&#39;ve hurt you so badly?&quot;

Questions Rei has often asked herself. They have hurt her, yet she still 
cared for hem. Was she stupid? Or did she just have a thing for 
heartache?

&quot;Is it for the same reason as me? Then... I guess we have something in 
common.&quot;

Everything came to a screeching halt in Rei&#39;s mind and if she wasn&#39;t 
already lying down, a feather would have knocked her onto her ass. What 
did Hotaru just say? She did love someone. Disappointment coursed 
through the miko, making her body burn while sucking all the energy from 
her at the same time.

&quot;You&#39;ll awake soon, it&#39;s almost ten.&quot;

Hotaru gazed at Rei&#39;s peaceful face, half on top of her.

&quot;You&#39;ll never know what I&#39;ve said. But I almost wish you would... 
somehow.&quot;

A soft hand caressed Rei&#39;s cheek with utmost, and almost frightened, 
care. With another sigh, Hotaru climbed out of bed. Once she left the 
room, the miko&#39;s eyes snapped open and she gasped for breath.

Hotaru made her way tiredly over to the kitchen. The miko had left the 
apartment sometime in the afternoon and has yet to return. After calling 
Hikari and updating her on last night, the college student has been 
wandering around aimlessly. The internet had become dull and boring 
quite a few hours ago.

So, that&#39;s why she was blasting music and writing. Usually, she&#39;d be 
overjoyed to have a moment to herself and simply write. But something 
was in the air today, unsettling her.

She was sure it had nothing to do with youma trying to destroy the 
world. It concerned Rei. And why the hell her guardians won&#39;t pick up 
their cell phones!

So, now the petite girl sat before an empty page, the fourth glass of 
water she&#39;s had in the past ten minutes beside her. A pen was tucked 
behind her ear, since she had no use for it at this point. Where was 
inspiration when you need it?

&quot;I&#39;ll love you for tonight, then we&#39;re never to meet again. A thousand 
wishes, a million regrets and a billion nights filled with desire for 
you. But never again shall I stray down that road...&quot;

With an annoyed growl, Hotaru crumpled the paper and chucked it across 
the room. Everything she wrote related to Rei and her damn feelings for 
her. The college student&#39;s inner desires were starting to make 
themselves known. She wanted the miko, no doubts about it. But one night 
of passion will lead to years of regret and wondering if it was just 
lust or something deeper that caused the miko to be with her for that 
night. And she had no desire to spend the next couple of hundred years 
with Rei wondering.

Well, maybe she could patrol the galaxy while Rei stayed on Earth with 
Neo-Serenity. But no, she couldn&#39;t stand to be away from the rest of 
them for too long.

Besides, it would ruin the relationship they had. How do you look your 
friend in the face after a night resulting in uncontrolled passion and 
lust?

You don&#39;t. At least, Hotaru wouldn&#39;t be able to. She&#39;d be thinking of 
Rei&#39;s touch, her kisses and of the miko in ways she shouldn&#39;t. She would 
want Rei all the time.

And this is BEFORE they&#39;ve even do anything? Like kiss? She was thinking 
way too much, about things that probably didn&#39;t even need to be thought 
about. Because she will never lose herself to her lust.

&quot;I&#39;ll love you for tonight, then we are never to meet again... Geez 
Hotaru, this is a little depressing, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

The violet-eyed girl knew who it was without having to look up. She 
stood quickly and all but flew into the waiting arms.

&quot;Haruka-papa!&quot;

&quot;Hey, kid.&quot;

The tall blonde knew something was up when there was no protest from the 
shorter woman at the nickname. Instead, the small girl remained in her 
embrace while her own arms tightened around her &quot;Papa.&quot;

&#39;This might take a while,&#39; Haruka thought, steering Hotaru back to the 
chair.

&quot;All right, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Everything.&quot;

The urge to groan out-loud was crushed by the blonde&#39;s concern. The 
concern then caused the urge to throttle Rei into the ground to 
strengthen. They let Hotaru stay with her for just a few days and the 
young woman&#39;s now a total mess.

&quot;All right, tell me.&quot;

Silence was the response for a while as Hotaru attempted to collect her 
thoughts. The guardian before her wasn&#39;t the best to discuss this with. 
How she wished Michiru-mama was here.

&quot;Hotaru, Setsuna told us what happened that night during dinner.&quot;

The wince was unable to be suppressed, causing Haruka&#39;s anger to grow. 
Why couldn&#39;t Hotaru fall for a nice young man or woman without all the 
baggage Rei carried? What was it about the miko that intrigued her 
daughter so? Why did she love the lavender-eyed one with such a passion?

&quot;The same reason you love me and I, you. She just does.&quot;

The serene voice caused both of them to look up, though it wasn&#39;t 
needed. Michiru Kaioh sat on the couch across the large office, knowing 
eyes trained on her family.

&quot;Michiru-mama...&quot;

At the sound of the soft whimper, the regal woman stood and made her way 
to her daughter. The dark-haired girl willingly fell into the 
violinist&#39;s arms, burying her face in the woman&#39;s bosom. Aquamarine eyes 
spared a look at her angry lover before returning to focus on the 
confused girl in her arms.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Hotaru. Everything will be fine.&quot;

Violet eyes suddenly glared accusingly at the two as the college student 
pulled away.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t either of you answer your phones?&quot;

An apologetic expression appeared on Haruka&#39;s face as she reached over 
to run her long fingers through her daughter&#39;s hair.

&quot;Setsuna told us not to.&quot;

At the mention of the third parent, Hotaru&#39;s eyes narrowed, her body 
stiffening. The two older women shared a look.

&quot;As angry as you are at Setsuna,&quot; Michiru murmured softly, &quot;you have to 
remember that she loves you.&quot;

&quot;I know that. I also know she loves another, and that is the problem.&quot;

The tall racer sighed, love made people think and say the craziest 
things.

&quot;Hotaru-chan, it&#39;s not Setsuna&#39;s fault she loves Minako. You can&#39;t help 
who you love. You just do.&quot;

The youngest Senshi was not going to be persuaded that easily. She 
needed someone to blame, and Setsuna was the perfect target. She knew 
the blame was misplaced, but couldn&#39;t seem to care.

&quot;Hotaru, things happen for a reason. Believe it or not, there&#39;s a reason 
Rei loved Usagi-chan only to be rejected. And there is a reason why 
things with Minako happened the way they did.&quot;

A soft growl came from the confused girl. A reason? Was there one 
besides to torment her love and make her unable to love? She&#39;ll give a 
shiny penny to whoever tells her what that reason was.

&quot;Whatever the reason, it bites,&quot; she said instead.

The guardians of the petite girl shared a look, both amused, despite the 
situation. Love did always bring out the worse and best in people.

&quot;So, are you going to stick at it or give up?&quot;

The question struck Hotaru, silencing her as her brows furrowed. She 
loved Rei, that much was obvious. The miko had feelings for her, as 
Hikari pointed it, whether lust or otherwise, she didn&#39;t know. But she 
knew she couldn&#39;t walk away from the lavender-eyed business woman. Not 
now. On the other hand, could she continue to love a woman who, perhaps, 
did not have the ability to love anymore?

Michiru bent down and pulled a thoughtful Hotaru into another hug. 
Pulling away, her twinkling eyes gazed firmly into her daughter&#39;s darker 
ones, a smile on the older woman&#39;s lips.

&quot;Don&#39;t give up.&quot;

Hotaru could only blink as Michiru walked over to Haruka, who stood in 
the middle of the room and wrapped her arms around her lover&#39;s neck. 
Then, as if to prove a point, the woman pulled her confused partner down 
and fixed upon her lips a passionate kiss.

&quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot;

Before a comment could be made by either of the two other women in the 
room, the couple disappeared. Hotaru sat, silent while she contemplated 
her situation. After several minutes, she stood and walked out of the 
office. But not before smiling and looking up. She knew who was 
responsible for calling on her parents.

&quot;Thanks, Setsuna-mama.&quot;

She really needed that.
