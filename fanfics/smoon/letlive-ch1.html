<p>There was an annoyingly loud ring that stung Usagi’s ears, and she  woke up with an incredibly painful headache. She was in her room, and  it was morning. Usagi glanced at her clock, and it was a quarter to  eight. <em>Oh no! Not again! </em>Usagi could not afford one more tardy  in her record. She struggled to get up, and staggered a bit on her way  to the bathroom. As soon as she gained her composure, Usagi tried to  her best to get ready as fast as she could and rushed outside her house.</p>
<p><em>Great, </em>she thought, <em>late again.</em> Her head throbbed as she ran, but paid no attention to it. As she  peeked into the classroom, she could see that Ami was already in class  listening intently to their instructor. Usagi took a deep breath,  knowing what was to come. All eyes were on her. Ami looked at Usagi and  sighed. However, she gave her a reassuring smile as the instructor  started scolding Usagi. Slowly, she walked towards her seat and sank  into it. <em>This is going to be a long day, </em>she thought as she looked outside the window.</p>
<p>After  school, she and Ami met with the other senshi at the Hikawa Temple.  They decided to have a sleepover the week before and planned out  everything. Makoto brought some of her snacks as usual.</p>
<p>“Where’s Minako?” asked Ami as she scanned the room.</p>
<p>“Oh. Recording at the studio again. She’ll be here once it’s over,” replied Rei.</p>
<p>Usagi  took a spot on the floor and sat there. It began to rain and she  listened to the drone of raindrops crashing against the rooftop of the  temple. She started to feel cold as it got darker outside and hugged  her knees for warmth. Her friends began a heated discussion about the  recent youma they defeated, but Usagi paid no attention to it. Her  headache started to grow more painful and she rubbed her temples in an  effort to ease the pain. She tried desperately to stay awake and  occasionally yawned, as her eyes grew heavier. Before she knew it,  someone threw a pillow at her and she looked towards where it was  thrown. Everyone was looking at her.</p>
<p>“Usagi. What’s wrong? You’re actually quiet today.” asked Rei.</p>
<p>She looked at Rei, and shook her head, “Gomen. I’m just not in the mood.”</p>
<p>All  the girls looked at each other confused. Usagi is actually not hyper?  Strange. Usagi looked at them and laughed nervously. “Oh no. I meant  that I’m just tired. Maybe I should just splash some water in my face  to wake me up.”</p>
<p>Usagi stood up and began walking towards the  bathroom. Her head started to spin and everything around her began to  blur as she almost lost her balance and caught herself.</p>
<p>“Whoa there. You okay?” asked Makoto as eyed her friend.</p>
<p>“Hai, I must have gotten up to fast,” answered Usagi.</p>
<p>“Maybe you should sit down a bit,” said Ami.</p>
<p>Usagi  nodded in agreement as she turned around to go back. Everything felt  heavy to her. She swayed, and her head throbbed even more painfully.  Suddenly, Usagi felt as if she were quickly lifted from the ground. Her  surroundings went black.</p>
<p>Rei ran towards Usagi as her body fell  limp towards the floor and caught her friend in time before hitting the  ground. “Usagi?! Usagi?!” cried Rei. Usagi began to shiver tremendously  and Ami felt Usagi’s forehead.</p>
<p>“She’s burning up. Usagi! Can you hear me?! Usagi!” yelled Ami. She mumbled something and fell silent.</p>
<hr />
Usagi  slowly opened her eyes and found that she looking at the ceiling of  Rei’s room. It was dark, and she still heard raindrops trickling down  the roof. She saw a shed of light that shined through the gap of the  door and heard a few mumbled voices. Her head slightly throbbed as she  sat up, but she immediately fell back into the futon as dizziness began  to grab hold of her once again. She tried to get up once more and was  successful. Usagi staggered towards the door, but was half way there  when she started to lean against something for support. Accidentally  knocking down a few books, she most likely made a racket, because  suddenly her friends rushed to the room.
<p>“Usagi?! You shouldn’t over  exert yourself!” exclaimed Rei as she ran towards her friend. Usagi  found herself leaning on Rei, who was leading her back into bed. Usagi  sighed slightly but was grateful.</p>
<p>“No need to worry Rei-chan. I’m fine see,” she said as she forced a smile.</p>
<p>“We’re  not buying that,” said someone. The voice was familiar and Usagi looked  around. It belonged to none other than Aino Minako. She stood beside  Rei and looked down at her friend.</p>
<p>“Minako-chan!” exclaimed Usagi as she tried to sit up. However, Rei forced her back down.</p>
<p>“I came as soon as Rei called and told me that you collapsed,” said the pop-idol, “Usagi. What happened?”</p>
<p>Usagi  looked at the ceiling again and then back at her friends. “Nothing, I  think it’s because I lacked sleep last night. Just tired, but I’m fine  now!”</p>
<p>Everyone sighed.</p>
<p>“Not from what it seems,” said Makoto as she looked at Usagi.</p>
<p>“You  should rest, and we’ll plan something tomorrow to make up for tonight.  Well, that’s if you’re feeling better,” said Ami as she gave Usagi a  reassuring smile.</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“Nope. Not hearing it, ” said Makoto.</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“Rest Usagi. And we’ll see you in the morning,” replied Rei.</p>
<p>Before they could leave the room, Usagi yelled, “BUT I’M SCARED! I DON’T WANNA SLEEP ALONE!!”</p>
<p>All four girls stopped, turned around and sighed.</p>
<p>“Usagi. You sleep alone in your house, what’s so different about Rei’s room?”</p>
<p>“It’s dark. Rei doesn’t have a nightlight. I’m afraid of the dark!” exclaimed Usagi.</p>
<p>“Well, I can’t sleep with a light on,” said Rei.</p>
<p>Usagi  looked at them with pleading eyes, until finally they sighed and gave  in. One by one, they moved their belongings from the guest room to  Rei’s room, and by the time they moved the last of their things Usagi  was sound asleep. Makoto and Ami took any available spot on the floor,  while Rei started to lock up the temple. Minako followed Rei outside  and they began to talk.</p>
<p>“You think it was just exhaustion?” asked Minako.</p>
<p>“Something tells me there’s more to it. Before she collapsed she kept rubbing her temples. You don’t think-“</p>
<p>“Possibly,  but I hope not. I don’t want any of my friends to experience that  amount suffering as I did. Not again. Not when we were given a second  chance.”</p>
