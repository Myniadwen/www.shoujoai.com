<h1>Secrets and Things Not Well Hidden (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crawlspace.html">Crawlspace</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Serena sat at her desk, pen in hand, staring at the paper in  front of 
her.  The date was written neatly in the top corner of the  page, but 
so far that was all she had been able to set down.  She just  didn&#146;t 
know how to start her diary entry this time.  Lately, it was  becoming 
harder and harder to express just how complicated her life had  
become. 	

It had been almost a week since the incident at the Marine  Cathedral.  
So much had happened that day.  The mystery of the  unidentified 
Sailor Scouts had been solved, and two people she had  begun to think 
of as friends were suddenly her enemies.  She had seen  one lying dead 
when she got to the cathedral.  The other might just as  well have 
been for the dead look in her eyes. 	

That look was what was bothering Serena tonight.  She gnawed on  the 
end of her pen and glanced over at the magazine she had taken from  
Sammy&#146;s room earlier.  It was open to a photo spread of a charity race 
from back in February.  Serena didn&#146;t recognize any of the drivers and 
very few of the big name sports gurus in attendance.  But one picture  
had caught her eye, and now she stared at it still in shock and  
disbelief. 	

Serena closed her eyes and shook her head, as if that could clear  the 
image from her brain.  For several seconds she held her breath,  then 
exhaled dramatically.  A moment later, pen met paper as the blonde  
tried to work out her jumbled thoughts.        

-------------------------------------------------------------------

~When I got there, Neptune &#150; no, Michelle &#150; was dead.  Or at  least I 
thought she was.  And Uranus did too, judging by the look in  her 
eyes.  I&#146;ve seen her eyes cold before, but never like this.  They  
were dead, soulless.  It scared me.       

~Amara is Uranus.  Part of me knew that even before the whole  thing 
with Mina, but it still surprises me to actually see it.  And  
everything happened so fast.  She was holding on to the gun.  For a  
second I really thought she would give it to me and we could find a 
way  to make things right.  But she pushed me away and put it to her 
chest.   She didn&#146;t hesitate at all.  And she pulled the trigger&#133;~   	

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Serena stopped writing for a second to rub at her eyes.  She  would 
never forget that suicidal moment in the other Scout&#146;s life.  She  was 
still having nightmares about it.        

~How could she do that?  How could anyone just end their life  that 
way?  Don&#146;t get me wrong.  Michelle is her only family as far as I  
know, and it must have crushed her to see her die, but still&#133;       

~I love my brother, honest I do.  I may want him to go away and  stop 
being a brat sometimes, but if he died I would be upset.  I&#146;d even  
cry.  But would I be so devastated that I would kill myself right then  
and there to end the grief?  No.  The same goes for my friends.  
Molly,  Raye, all of them.  As much as I love them, my life is 
important to me.  There isn&#146;t anything I can think of&#133;~  	

Serena hesitated.  The end of her pen went back into her mouth as  a 
thought began to form.  She stared at the magazine picture.  Double- 
paned, the left side was Amara standing and cheering in the stands 
with  Michelle sitting next to her.  On the right, they were both 
standing,  and Amara had pulled Michelle into a kiss that was very 
definitely not  of cousinly affection.  In fact, it was almost just 
like when&#133; 	

Serena&#146;s eyes got wide as it finally hit her.  The idea was crazy;  
these two were cousins after all.  But it was making more and more  
sense. 	

After jotting down one last thing in her diary, Serena grabbed  her 
jacket off the back of her chair and headed for the front door.   She 
yelled to her parents that she was going out for awhile and left  
without waiting for a reply.  She hoped Raye wouldn&#146;t mind her 
stopping  by this late, but she needed to talk to someone about this 
now.  	

The diary sat open on Serena&#146;s desk, the magazine half on top of  it.  
The last word she had written was visible in the weak light from  her 
desk light.  &#147;Darien.&#148;
