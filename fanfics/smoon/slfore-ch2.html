&lt;200005 BC ()&gt;
Queen Amelia Wil Tesla Saillune stepped out at the balcony of the 
bedchamber she had spent the last night in - not her own at that. The 
sun hadn&#39;t risen yet and dawn was coloring the horizon in its colorful 
spectacle. It was weird, she rarely had had time in the last months to 
come out in the morning and watch the sunrise. Not that she was THAT 
romantic but the sight definitely had some appeal, a calming effect 
with which to begin a new stressful day. Now though, after one of the 
most bizarre and at the same time revealing encounters in her life - 
including the sudden duties of a ruler passed onto her after the 
successful assassination on her father Philionel. It was a small 
wonder that she felt so calm right now, not all disturbed with the 
hundred-eighty degree spin her - until now mostly non-existent - 
romantic life had taken.
	Amelia did not turn when the other woman stepped up next to her. 
Sylphiel Nels Lahda, trained shrine maiden - well, priestess in all 
but actually acknowledged status - joined her friend - and after the 
recent events most likely so much more - in watching the peaceful 
scene of the capital city that during the last months had been all but 
peaceful with the conflicts between Shinzoku, Mazoku and the renegade 
mixed tribe that had settled at Dragon&#39;s Peak affecting the human 
society and invoking fears and more than a bit wariness.
	&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Sylphiel asked after awhile of silence, 
glancing at her friend out of the corner of her eye.
	Amelia found the question horribly clich&eacute; but answered anyway 
with a wry smile. &quot;Weird. Definitely weird. But strangely enough not 
repulsed or anything... I... Somehow I always wondered if there was 
something. What surprised me more was Lina&#39;s open admission...&quot; She 
glanced sideways at the purple-haired woman who had gently laid one 
hand atop Amelia&#39;s.
	&quot;We are a lot more mature now. It&#39;s been... a long time since we 
all got to know each other.&quot;
	&quot;And since when did you know about her problems?&quot; Amelia asked, 
the question having nagged at her mind ever since finding her two 
friends from so long in a rather compromising position.
	The shrine maiden looked away briefly and Amelia thought she 
caught her grimace slightly. &quot;Since the beginning.&quot; The young queen 
raised her eyebrows at the flat, somewhat bitter tone. &quot;Lina... 
confided in me after the thing with Fibrizo was over. At first it was 
okay but then it got out of hand. She became more aggressive and 
well... I ended up leaving the group then. Not a smart move, yes. It 
was pitiful overreaction. I knew even back then that Lina&#39;s condition 
wasn&#39;t something she could control, she depended on me and well... As 
I said, we are all a lot older now and I think differently about 
this.&quot;
	Amelia stared at her friend and recent lover intently for a 
moment. The other woman finally turned to meet her gaze, blue meeting 
green, and a sensation of kinship and affection passed between them. 
&quot;But you love her, don&#39;t you? Not just an infatuation thing like 
Gourry?&quot;
	Sylphiel laughed merrily, having long since gotten over the 
notion of being embarrassed about her crush on the blonde swordsman. 
&quot;I think I already loved her back then. I had a lot of time to think 
after Copy Rezo and before I met up with you again. Neither of us was 
ready to admit anything back then though. We were young, insecure and 
the situation was rather bizarre... even by our standards.&quot;
	&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Amelia muttered. &quot;I worked so hard 
politically lately though, I wonder if anything can really shock me 
anymore. It&#39;s just, I don&#39;t know how to handle an emotional situation 
like this...&quot; She trailed of feeling the other woman&#39;s arm slip around 
her waist. The young queen did not quite know why but she felt the 
irresistible urge to lean her head against the taller woman and seeing 
as there was no reason to wear the mask of control here in the privacy 
of someone she had just shared the wildest night in her life with, 
Amelia complied with her instinct. A soft sigh escaped her lips when 
Sylphiel&#39;s arms fully slipped around her and she lifted her head to 
once again gaze into the gentle eyes of her friend, advisor and... 
lover. Strange, the term didn&#39;t really bother her at all.
	&quot;Will you be alright with this?&quot; Sylphiel asked softly.
	Amelia only hesitated for a moment. She and Sylphiel had become 
closer ever since the shrine maiden had come to stay with her a few 
months back. Without her friend&#39;s support she wondered if she had 
given up halfway through that stressful time filled with heavy 
diplomacy that she in no way felt really qualified to deal with but 
somehow ended up doing. And it was evident that Lina would need them 
both now, regardless of their feelings.
	Amelia could think of worse compromises. So, instead of 
answering, she moved forward and captured Sylphiel&#39;s lips with her 
own.

	The year 2001. The world has entered the new Millennium and the 
birth of a new age is proclaimed. Yet, the true birth is still to 
come, now in tangible distance. The Senshi prepare for the promised 
rebirth of their kingdom, enjoying the last months of normal life.
	But while events unforeseen begin to shatter the tranquility and 
happiness of their everyday life, in the shadows something old and 
absolute dark is stirring. Soon it will show its face and then, then

&lt;February 16, 2001 (Tomoyo)&gt;
With a startled gasp I returned to conscious awareness as the vision 
ended rather abruptly, leaving me with a particular taste as if almost 
having experienced personally what Memory had been relaying me. That 
was hardly a first, the nature of flashbacks being a rather realistic 
one. They often left me a lot to muse about.
	&quot;Woah...&quot; I murmured at the intense feelings left by that last 
particular experience. Not that it had been the first scene of such 
nature I had experienced in my still barely adequate &quot;memory 
training&quot;, far from it. But most of the time that which I did remember 
tended to center or at least prioritizes in dealing with Sakura and my 
past life. I think that was the first one about me and Sylphiel alone.
	&quot;Are you alright, Mistress?&quot; I glanced to the side seeing Memory 
hover there with a hesitant, somewhat worried expression.
	I was quick to alleviate her concerns though. &quot;It&#39;s alright. 
That particular memory was just... rather powerful. I know you can&#39;t 
really influence an exact memory, so don&#39;t feel bad about it. Besides, 
I want to learn after all.&quot; I smiled at the card sprite who relaxed in 
genuine relief. She was for all the perfection she had been crafted 
with by my darling Sakura a child at heart, barely more than a newborn 
in the sense of magical creatures and that tended to show sometimes. 
With a nod I signaled her that that would be enough for today and that 
she could return to the book.
	Standing up, I left the study as well, not really watching my 
way as I navigated through the large Daidouji mansion with the ease of 
someone who had grown up in the maze-like corridors. Even with all the 
additions and remodeling done to provide Sakura and lately me with a 
suitable environment for our respective magical profession I didn&#39;t 
really need to look to find my way, nor did I actually need to wonder 
about where to find Sakura - which was not always in the same place as 
one might expect. The short walk - relatively seen - gave me some time 
to muse about the recent memory. Remembering Sylphiel had become a lot 
easier lately, surely a sign that a meeting in this life was 
inevitable close. We had forged such deep bonds back then that they 
ought to reflect in this incarnation. Now, if we could just find 
her...
	I actually found Sakura in our personal &quot;living room&quot;. More or 
less the entire upper floor had been altered for us. While in our 
younger years we had often switched between here and Sakura&#39;s family 
residence, the room issue and other obligations had convinced the Card 
Mistress that it would be more convenient to stay here. I could very 
well understand that my girlfriend didn&#39;t want to leave her father 
alone at home now that her brother and Yukito had also moved out a 
year ago but it wasn&#39;t like we were on the other side of Earth after 
all.
	An affectionate smile crossed my lips as I studied Sakura in the 
position I found her in for awhile, aware that she knew very well I 
was standing there. Spread out on her chest, she lay with her arms 
propped up and her chin resting over her folded hands, her reddish 
hair falling over shoulders and partially obscuring that lovely face. 
With soft steps I moved forward and slid next to her on the spacious 
couch. Tentatively I let one hand trail through the fiery, wild mane 
of hair and proceeded to bring it back into some state of order. 
&quot;Enjoying yourself, Lina-chan?&quot;
	Sakura glanced over her shoulder at me with a knowing smile. 
&quot;Hmm, I remember someone always telling me I should relax more.&quot; She 
paused for a moment before adding in a curious tone, &quot;Lina-chan?&quot;
	&quot;Ah...&quot; I started not having noticed that reflecting on my past 
life experiences had once again rooted me to a different mindset. Not 
that either of us cared about the difference. There wasn&#39;t that much 
of a difference, at least not essentially. There where it counted, 
there was love, the only thing that truly mattered.
	&quot;Must have been intense if you&#39;re calling me that. I really 
should tell Memory-chan not to stir THAT kind of flashbacks too much,&quot; 
Sakura teased with a somewhat sultry grin that made me color just a 
little.
	&quot;Actually, it wasn&#39;t about you at all. It was... about Syl-chan 
and me.&quot; Sakura cocked an eyebrow at that. &quot;I think after our... um, 
first time together.&quot;
	&quot;Oh,&quot; Sakura elaborated and was silent for awhile, obviously 
thinking back at that time which had been a defining experience for 
all three of us and definitely the start of something wonderful - if 
much too short in the end - despite the initial awkwardness. &quot;Um...&quot; 
Sakura started again, clearly uncomfortable now, &quot;do you want to talk 
about it?&quot;
	I didn&#39;t need to ask what &quot;it&quot; was. After all &quot;it&quot; had began to 
affect our coupling recently as well. I understood from what Sakura 
told me about her condition that her excessive use of Chaos Magic and 
actually playing Avatar for the Lord of Nightmares - who back then was 
believed to be the creator of everything, Chaos personified - had a 
disturbing effect on her mana balance and triggered certain... needs 
in the young Lina Inverse who were as well sexual as they could get... 
aggressive when not satisfied. Lina had practically been drawn to 
those who presented a counterbalance to her Black Magic-orientated 
mana, thus people like me and Sylphiel who had both been trained as 
shrine maidens in White Magic, the natural opposite lore. Of course, 
that hadn&#39;t been all that had attracted Lina to us... and me to her. 
We had been young though and it took many years and experience to 
actually act on it. The way Amelia had found out about Lina&#39;s 
condition had been rather... disturbing but it helped that we all had 
been so much older then. All in all, everything had worked out fine 
and Lina ended up effectively stabilized physically, emotionally and 
mentally between the two of us.
	Mind you, Sakura was by far not that unbalanced as her past life 
had been. She had a side to her mana that was a pure force of 
creation, opposed to the destructiveness of Black Magic. But some of 
her prior condition was showing in recent... ahem, more &#39;kinky&#39; 
traits. Not that I minded all that much, rather enjoying some of her 
creative ideas, for Sakura it was obviously a troubling issue though.
	&quot;It&#39;s not like you can control it. And since you cast the Ragna 
Blade to prevent Pandora from breaking through the seal, you didn&#39;t 
have to cast any such magic,&quot; I assured my lover at last, having 
repositioned myself at the far end of the couch, providing a pillow 
for Sakura&#39;s head who had turned around to lay on her backside.
	&quot;But that&#39;s just it,&quot; the redhead argued with a dully pained 
expression. &quot;I am going to do a lot of that stuff shortly the way it&#39;s 
going. I talked to Time and she says by now Pandora might be able to 
actually sneak a scout through and that puts us on a very tight 
schedule to find Syl-chan before her. As much as we try, it appears to 
be inevitable that there will be another battle and I won&#39;t be able to 
hold back then.&quot; I sighed contently when Sakura reached up to cup my 
cheek with one hand. &quot;I don&#39;t want to end up hurting you, Lia-chan... 
I mean...&quot;
	I put a finger over her lips, silencing her with the gesture. 
&quot;And you won&#39;t. You know I have faith in you. We&#39;ll find Sylphiel 
before her and then I&#39;m sure we can recreate what we had before. You 
are not just Lina Inverse anymore, you are also Kinomoto Sakura, 
someone who mastered the Clow Cards and has the magic to create her 
own. Don&#39;t you think you can handle this now?&quot;
	Sakura smiled weakly. &quot;One day I&#39;m going to die - happily at 
that - from all that unconditional faith. It&#39;s just that I fear that I 
pushed open a door and this body - despite all my mental maturity - is 
not quite ready to deal with the full impact should I really do more 
than one casting... We both know what this one time nearly cost me.&quot;
	I didn&#39;t need to be reminded and hastily leaned down to kiss the 
other girl, extinguishing all the dark emotions threatening to 
materialize in a strangling cluster around my heart. Sakura responded 
in kind to the passionate kiss, clearly just as eager to find more 
pleasing things than to remember near death experiences.

(Makoto)
It was a bright and sunny morning in Minato-ku, a premature spring day 
you might say. The weather was rather erratic those first weeks of the 
new year, going from snow to heavy rains, to cloudy indifference and 
now to a warm sunbath that seemed to be much to the joy to the many 
people going after their regular activities on the market on a 
Saturday morning. If all, those erratic weather swings only served to 
heighten the sense of disquiet I had lately. The feelings that nature 
fed me only got stronger and it was about time that a serious meeting 
was called on this. The only problem being that there was no real... 
cause, no particular problem to point at. It was rather much like the 
quiet before the storm. Nature tended to sense when something major 
was about to happen and reacted accordingly. The experience of this 
unknown &#39;danger&#39; was slowly driving me crazy.
	Not that my life wasn&#39;t crazy enough already. Thinking about 
that faceless-possible threat was only reminding further on my own 
personal problems. Things had definitely not gotten better between 
Minako, Hotaru and myself. Ever since learning of the child that we 
had unconsciously conceived, a sort of quasi routine had been 
established between the three of us. Neither of us spoke about the 
incident following our leader&#39;s revelation anymore. It was clear that 
Minako herself was vastly uncomfortable with her reaction.
	Hotaru and I had made a point of visiting Minako regularly and 
supporting her as best as possible. But that had mostly been all there 
was to it. Minako did not reject the help when offered, obviously 
getting the point by now that we both felt equally responsible but 
neither did she especially ask for help. That did not only leave us at 
loss at how to react often but tended to get Minako in the one or 
other kind of trouble sometimes by overtaxing herself.
	I could understand that she was feeling irritated scooped up at 
home, doing nothing. That girl had always been someone who couldn&#39;t 
sit still for a moment and the demands her body put onto her were 
proving to unnerve her to no end. By now she was showing heavy signs 
of the impending baby, much more so than should be the case in roughly 
the fourth month. As far as we were able to tell, pregnancy for a 
Senshi obviously went a little different, not to mention much faster.
	The others had taken the revelations quite well - okay, aside 
from Michiru having to restrain Haruka from skinning Minako alive! - 
and I was seriously glad about it that neither of them tried to 
intrude too much on the already fragile &#39;relationship&#39; between us. It 
was hard enough to deal with Minako at times but coupled with the mood 
swings caused by her pregnancy the task was one a kami would think 
about twice before taking! Minako&#39;s continued closure about the 
emotional issue was driving both Hotaru and me nuts. The little 
Firefly was often lost in thought and while our own relationship had 
not weakened, it hadn&#39;t progressed either. All in all, the whole 
situation was seriously nuts and I began to slowly doubt my sanity.
	I moved along in the line of one of the food stands when a 
peculiar shout disrupted the normal bustle of activity on the market.
	&quot;Stop, thief! You are under arrest!&quot;
	I glanced up but didn&#39;t turn around, dismissing the incident 
right away. Stuff like that always happened. Senshi or not, if I&#39;d 
jump in for any crazy burglar the police wouldn&#39;t have any work to do 
and I had by far much more important things to worry about when to 
give the distinctive familiar voice a hand in catching the thief. In 
fact, if it wasn&#39;t so silly, I could have sworn the voice sounded just 
like Minako&#39;s...
	I whirled around sharply, causing those nearest to me in the 
line to back off in the face of the ferocity of the maneuver. My eyes 
scanned the area swiftly and encountered a cloaked figure moving away 
through the crow with speed and agility that went far beyond that of a 
normal human. Hot on the figure&#39;s tail was a blonde woman who, even 
over the distance, I had no trouble identifying.
	&quot;Minako,&quot; I growled and the few choice words that described my 
thoughts at the moment about my pregnant friend once again pulling a 
stunt like that made some of the other woman waiting in the line 
flinch in either sympathy or askance. I had left my place and was 
moving before most of the onlookers even registered what was going on. 
Vaulting over people&#39;s heads and slipping in-between the crowds I cut 
a direct course of interception for the cloaked figure. Quite frankly 
I could care less about the thief. I was mad as hell and I really 
wanted to give Minako an earful. But my pride wouldn&#39;t allow me to get 
away with letting a criminal escape on my account. So, figuring the 
fastest way to get Minako to stop and give her that piece of my mind 
would be to stop the thief, I crossed the last bit of distance, and 
threw myself into a flying kick that should have come close to taking 
the figure&#39;s head off. Of course I had intended to pull the strike at 
the last moment but I was too surprised when the thief actually DODGED 
the attack that came with a speed that should be impossible for anyone 
but a superhuman or seasoned Martial Artist to even sense! I sailed 
past my initial target and just managed to catch myself on the sunroof 
of one stand before crashing foot-first into it.
	By the time I got both feet back on the ground, Minako had 
caught up, studying the cloaked figure - who made no attempt to resume 
the escape but neither of surrendering - with more caution, obviously 
having caught the evasive maneuver. The unexpected miss had rattled me 
enough to bite back my angry comment for now as I joined Minako but I 
could not help making a snippy comment. &quot;Fancy meeting you here of all 
people,&quot; I said, giving Minako&#39;s outfit a side glance. &quot;Dressed like a 
regular street cop no less.&quot;
	The blonde had the decency to at least look chagrinned upon 
being caught. &quot;Alright,&quot; she addressed the figure now. &quot;I have you 
now, you&#39;d better give up.&quot; Contrary to her threat she didn&#39;t move 
forward though and the figure seemed to sense that. Instead of 
answering there came a different kind of reaction, one wholly 
unexpected even though one could probably say, &quot;Story of our life.&quot; 
Before our astonished eyes the figures seemed to waver, then distort 
into a shapeless cloud before reforming into... a shapeless mass. 
Actually it looked almost like a... blob? &quot;Hah?&quot; Minako stated 
intelligible, echoing my thoughts exactly. After a slight pause Minako 
finally rolled her eyes and quibbled, &quot;Now really, five years of 
nothing and now... this?&quot;
	While I could not agree any less with that, I moved slightly in 
front of my friend. Casting a glance around it was evident that there 
were too much onlookers to safely transform. &quot;Careful, we don&#39;t know 
what...&quot; All at once the blob shape seemed to contradict before 
expanding again with sudden force, spraying grayish slime in all 
directions. I had only a split second to react upon seeing Minako 
tense and wince in the middle of taking evasive action. With the speed 
granted by my training and the dormant yet still formidable traits 
granted from Jupiter I managed to get us both clear of the slime. 
Suffice to say all hell broke loose on the market with people running 
hither and wither, trying to get away from the obvious acidic slime.
	&quot;You okay?&quot; I asked Minako concerned. The blonde had her face 
crunched in a mask of barely controlled pain and the way she was 
gripping her stomach it was not hard to figure out the cause of her 
distress. &quot;Baka, what were you thinking doing something so stressing 
like that.&quot;
	Minako grimaced. &quot;It wasn&#39;t supposed to entail super fast 
thieves that turn into ugly... well, whatever that thing is.&quot; I gave 
her a look that all but said there would be an accounting for this 
incident later. For now though I had something else to take care of.

******************************

(Hotaru)
You have to give it to the whims of fate. They always happened with 
the oddest timing as I had learned countless times before, not to 
mention very recently again. Right now one of those whims hit when I 
was halfway through the process of another test of my now 
fully-acquired - or reacquired - ability to create dimensional 
portals. I was so far gone that I might as well not have noticed the 
sensation if the prickling feeling of immanent danger was not so 
disturbingly familiar. As it was I paused almost a full minute, 
redirecting my focus on the Astral Plane in order to &#39;listen&#39; to that 
curious and... old feeling. Old as in ancient, ancient as in a pattern 
I had not felt in roughly two hundred millennia, before the Silver 
Millennium, upon THAT time. And that which was Saturn in me, or better 
that which was Phoebe, reacted with a start that set all my senses on 
full red alert.
	The transformation flowed over my body even as I was already 
racing the rooftops, following the distinctive pattern that I had 
picked up and praying to my ancestors - or better to other&#39;s ancestors 
since I was much to old myself in a relative sense to refer to anyone 
by that term - that I was mistaken.
	Of course, I wasn&#39;t. What did you expect? Sure enough as I 
arrived in one of the markets I knew Makoto frequented - ESPECIALLY 
today -, sure enough there I found a mob of panicking people running 
around uncoordinated in an attempt that hardly was suited to term 
proper fleeing. And in the midst of that chaos were Makoto and... 
Minako - that made me stumble for a moment, before I willed myself to 
ignore the implications for the moments - confronting a form that if 
you really wanted to term one for such a thing would remind one of a 
jelly or maybe to put it simpler... a classic... blob.
	Said blob was right now giving Makoto a lesson why exactly it 
was a thoroughly unwise idea to confront this creature without her 
Senshi powers... not that I said it was wise to confront it at all, 
especially not alone. My lover was learning that lesson at the moment, 
being unable to keep up, in spite of her quite formidable speed, with 
something that seemed so... harmless.
	Of course that view was probably radically altered by my present 
and past life lovers as the blob - after sending Makoto to the ground 
- began to shape-shift into something more befitting its danger 
potential. The same grayish substance reformed into a only remotely 
humanoid figure, with a built much similar to that of a troll and 
hideous skull with one single eye and a mouth baring a row of fangs 
that would have impressed a werewolf. No doubt the giant claws on the 
massive &#39;hands&#39; and feet were just as perilous to anyone who was 
foolish enough to make contact. And the fact that the creature did not 
hesitate right now to focus its attention on the two, at the moment 
rather helpless girls, I had no intention of renewing memories almost 
forgotten.
	&quot;SILENCE WALL!&quot;
	I thrust out the Silence Glaive and erected a force field just 
in time to absorb the energy beam that had come from the creature&#39;s 
eye without warning. With a leap I crossed the remaining distance and 
positioned myself between the other two and the hideous beast. &quot;A 
seeker,&quot; I mumbled just loud enough for Makoto and Minako to hear, 
&quot;And here I thought they were extinct by now.&quot;
	Before I was able to answer my current lover&#39;s shout or explain 
anything, I had to spin my weapon in a whirling motion to block the 
second energy blast that curved around my frontal shield like a 
boomerang. &#39;Kuso, forgot how resourceful those things are.&#39; Turning 
the block into a thrust I managed to drive the creature back a little 
who was obviously wary of the Silence Glaive. That hint of knowledge 
and the way in which the Seeker had reacted to my mere presence was 
creating a sense of foreboding I was not quite ready to give any 
serious thought to in the current life or death situation.
	&quot;Stand back!&quot; I shouted when I sensed Makoto advance behind me 
and at once sprung into action, falling into a pattern of carefully 
planned attacks that were as much to drive the creature away from my 
friends as it was to give me more space to move, not restricted to 
pose as a human shield. As it was I would have no chance standing up 
to the creature. They were as ruthless as they can get, even more so, 
and would not hesitate to use the slightest disadvantage against a 
foe.
	The Seeker growled in a way that was purely unearthly, somewhat 
reminding me of the sounds an undead creature like a zombie would make 
but with a distinctive quality to it that made everyone whoever 
encountered their kind recognize this creature right away.
	I let myself slip into my Saturn aspect completely, especially 
the oldest part of me that was Phoebe, the first Senshi of Saturn, 
knowing that only she had any idea about properly dealing with this 
threat. I was eternally gratefully for the intense training regiment 
Minako had insisted should be upheld because without the extra speed 
and agility I might as well have made close contact with those claws 
already and the possibilities of such a contact could be disastrous 
beyond comprehension should my nagging suspicion prove to be the 
truth.
	As it was I was simply hard pressed to achieve a stalemate. The 
Seeker fought with a wildness that was truly bestial but still 
including intelligence in form of complex, tactical awareness that 
would prompt one to acknowledge a higher state of mind. Essentially 
that was what made them so hard to fight and suited their qualities as 
both scouts and assassins. Despite the initial appearance, they were 
highly intelligent and independent-minded when the assigned task 
called for it.
	A flash of green caught in the corner of my eye and I suppressed 
a curse, sensing Jupiter charge up for an attack. Obviously the area 
had been sufficiently enough vacated for a transformation or my lover 
just didn&#39;t care - which would well suit her protective character. I 
would have rather liked them to stay back and evacuate with the rest 
of the people. Having no time to relate my reasoning on that matter 
though, I had to make due with the hand dealt to me and dodged down 
into a crouch, letting the lightning projectile soar over my head 
before springing into a back flip that landed me right next to Jupiter 
with my glaive poised for a follow-up strike. &quot;SILENCE GLAIVE 
SURPRISE!&quot; The orb of purple-black energy slammed into the Seeker just 
a moment after Jupiter&#39;s own attack had temporary distracted it.
	&quot;Think we got it?&quot; my partner asked guardedly, obviously picking 
up on my reluctance to relax in spite of the explosion momentarily 
swallowing our assailant.
	&quot;Hardly,&quot; I answered, turning a hard look in Minako&#39;s direction 
who had been standing a bit to the side, henshin crystal in hand but 
clearly reluctant to act for several factors. I gave a shake of my 
head and a hard, reproving stare that broke no argument and the blonde 
almost automatically backed away. &quot;They are not the kind to be 
terminated that easily,&quot; I elaborated further in reply to Jupiter&#39;s 
question.
	&quot;What exactly are we talking about here?&quot; Jupiter inquired, 
shifting her stance as the smoke cleared and the Seeker emerged 
looking none the worse.
	&quot;Believe me,&quot; I said grimly. &quot;If I had a choice about it, I 
would rather run now than fighting one of them under these 
circumstances. Unfortunately we have too much vast space for an 
effective escape. They are really...&quot; Before I could finish that 
sentence the Seeker was in our face. I had been prepared for this but 
no preparation could really help when the enemy was so fast you could 
barely blink before it moved. Narrowly I managed to avoid a strike 
that could have resulted in possible lethal wound and just took the 
brunt end of a strike that would put shame to any boxer, lifting my 
body of the ground for a good distance before coming to a none to 
gentle stop. At any other time I would have felt touched at Minako&#39;s 
desperate exclamation but the fact that my nerves were assaulted with 
a temporary paralyzing numbness and that in fact Minako was the only 
one still standing with Jupiter on the ground to her other side, I 
silently resolved that we were in very big trouble.
	Again, following the sometimes quite predictable whims of fate, 
something prevented us all from an early and most likely torturous 
death. And I could only blink in astonishment as I heard and saw what 
I hadn&#39;t in a very LONG time.
	&quot;FIREBALL!&quot;
	For those who lived in her time that word alone, heck, make that 
very element alone was almost instinctively associated with one owner 
should you have the delight - or in most cases the displeasure - of 
meeting its mistress. And Phoebe had known her on a quite personal 
level. And so while I could not make out any clear features when I 
first spotted the figure shadowed against the sun, I could see her 
aura, that while somewhat different in the course of reincarnation was 
bearing traits that anyone who had encountered the sorceress known as 
Lina Inverse and understood just a trifle about magic would recognize.

******************************

(Sakura)
&quot;It appears they&#39;re in over their head,&quot; I commented, thinking just 
again how very funny - in a purely ironic manner - it was that we 
always ran into them when in fact we just wanted to find our missing 
companion. Really, how hard could it be to search one city - even as 
big as Tokyo - for one girl? You&#39;d be amazed, really. And I was pretty 
sure even that she had to be near us but all our research had resulted 
in nothing and for some reason it was impossible for me to track her 
magically. It was almost as if someone was deliberately cloaking 
Sylphiel&#39;s reincarnation&#39;s presence from us. And that was plain 
annoying. Especially in light of the very thing I saw transpiring just 
below our vantage point from a low rooftop overlooking one of 
Minato-ku&#39;s markets.
	&quot;I just don&#39;t believe it. Of all the things she brought through, 
it had to be a Seeker,&quot; I grumbled, watching anxiously as one of the 
girls - probably a Senshi too - got thoroughly clobbered by the 
creature who wasn&#39;t even putting up much of an effort. It had to be 
just our luck that we&#39;d run into them again right now. I had 
recognized Venus in the crowd by mere coincidence and that hadn&#39;t been 
long before she got involved with the would-be thief, eventually 
climaxing in the situation at hand.
	&quot;What&#39;s that thing?&quot; Kero-chan asked. I was somewhat glad to 
have him with me once more. He had mostly offered to scout for 
Sylphiel&#39;s reincarnation lately and I had missed his company. Kero was 
feeling a bit neglected and well... useless as of late because my 
magical ability AND knowledge had far surpassed anything he could ever 
hope to teach me. He was still so very loyal and wanted to help out 
some way.
	&quot;Seekers are a mysterious race. No one knows for sure where they 
originate from and who or what exactly they are affiliated with for 
the matter. The name is probably not even what they call themselves 
but the one civilization gave them. They possess a lot of nasty 
abilities that go far beyond that of mere beast-man or other such 
meta-human creatures that lived on Earth in the old times. One thing 
is for sure, their primary tasks are scouting and assassination. They 
are like... well, super ninjas if you like. Just much, much more 
powerful. And they work as mercenaries for beings with power who&#39;d 
have a use for their abilities, mostly who are unable to deal with a 
task themselves for some reason.&quot;
	&quot;You mean like...&quot; Tomoyo trailed off. I looked at her grimly 
and there was not really a necessity to finish this sentence. I knew 
for a fact that there had been a lot of these creatures working for 
Pandora in the great war. And a Seeker was a natural hunter. If 
someone wanted a specific target eliminated or just simply found, then 
a Seeker would be the best choice. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we... um, help?&quot; Tomoyo 
asked tentatively, shooting a worried glance towards the duo in the 
midst of the out of control mob.
	&quot;Right,&quot; I said. &quot;A bit premature to make an entrance but we 
really can&#39;t let her get that lucky. Besides, I don&#39;t want that one 
after Syl...&quot; I was interrupted as the Seeker below fired an energy 
beam at the two girls which was repelled by a barrier at the last 
moment. I watched with growing interest and a little surprise as a 
figure interposed herself between the Seeker and the other woman. 
&quot;Phoebe?&quot; I whispered, not having expected that turn of events but at 
the same time wondering why I was even surprised. I&#39;ve seen her eight 
years ago, relatively speaking, after all.
	I watched for a while as the new arrival engaged her adversary 
into combat and while I was too far away to make out anything in 
particular the fighting style was distinctive enough and the aura was 
so perfectly matched... She wasn&#39;t like Venus who was unaware of how 
much she resembled Peitho... scratch that, she WAS her rebirth down to 
the last detail, that much I had confirmed from Love. No, this one 
really was Phoebe and the aura was so active there was no doubt about 
it that she was quite aware of it. &quot;Hmm,&quot; I mused, unconsciously 
chanting a familiar spell under my breath while Saturn and her 
companion got thrown around hard. &quot;Stay here, Tomoyo.&quot; I could sense 
the argument and added in a voice that broke no argument, &quot;This one&#39;s 
too heavy for you on your current level. Amelia in full possession of 
her power could have dealt with it but you are by far not at her 
level.&quot; With that I let the Fireball spell fly with sure and clear 
aim, following its path downward before either Tomoyo or Kero had a 
chance to respond. I cast a quick glance around, noticing that the 
area was pretty much vacant by now. All the other visitors of the 
market had evacuated which meant I could actually cut loose.
	&quot;Lina-san?&quot;
	I looked in the direction of the voice and upon seeing the 
recognition in the purple eyes gave a nod. &quot;Phoebe. It is... nice to 
see you again.&quot; I turned my attention towards the Seeker who had by 
now managed to extinguish the flames of the Fireball. &quot;Even if I had 
preferred the situation less troublesome.&quot;
	Saturn gave a snort, struggling to get to her feet. &quot;No 
kidding.&quot;
	I gestured for her to stand back, seeing as the Seeker was ready 
to resume the battle and the two Senshi were in no condition to put up 
a good fight. Also, I knew that prolonging the fight would in most 
cases only resolve in serving to those creatures&#39; advantage. They had 
a really high stamina and could take a lot of damage which left only a 
few spells at my disposal to effectively deal with them... None of 
them would be really kind on the surrounding area. &quot;You&#39;d better get 
clear. I don&#39;t intend to play with this one.&quot;
	Saturn hesitated slightly while the taller Senshi was already 
keen on getting her revenge. &quot;Like hell, this thing is gonna pay 
for...&quot; She was cut off when Saturn dragged her and the still 
untransformed Venus away. I smirked at that, glad that Phoebe got the 
message right away. Then I stared for a moment because there was 
something very curious about those three. There wasn&#39;t just a strong 
connection between Phoebe and her designated mate but the other Senshi 
was also somehow in the mix. I was by far no expert on reading soul 
bonds, that was more Peitho&#39;s thing but as much as I could tell...
	&quot;SHIELD!&quot;
	Just in time I sensed the attack and activated my trusted 
defensive card, sending a glare into the Seeker&#39;s direction. &quot;Hey, do 
you mind? I was getting to you in a moment anyway.&quot; There was a brief 
war between two minds, two sets of ethics. On the one hand there was 
Sakura who basically did not like to resolve to violence on principle 
to solve a situation. On the other hand there was Lina Inverse who, by 
definition, had been the very opposite of that principle in her youth. 
And while she had grown up a lot, she was never one to have qualms 
about unleashing her magic on those that bore her ill will. In the end 
Sakura won... sort of. since my own experience in my old timeline had 
shown me that being good and avoiding a fight, if possible, did not 
always solve matters.
	And I really could not let this creature get away. Surely 
enough, it had run into the Senshi by mere chance and its actual 
target was another. If my guess was right - and it really took no 
great genius to figure out the actual target - then there was no way I 
could let this Seeker run loose.
	&#39;That&#39;s bound to get some really interesting headlines 
tomorrow&#39;, I mused before beginning the incantation of a spell that 
was once as much respected as it was feared.

******************************

(Minako)
I had seen some things that would push a normal human being&#39;s mind on 
the verge of sanity. I had fought creatures and dark entities that 
slaughtered and instilled fear in whole civilizations. And yet I was 
unable to mentally and intellectually process the next few seconds. I 
was still trying to come to terms with the situation, a situation 
that, denial or not, I had a great part in causing myself. On some 
level I knew that I would get quite an earful about this later and I 
deserved it. But that creature had been insanely strong, to a point 
where Saturn and Jupiter together had both been almost beaten and all 
three of us almost met our demise if not for the interruption of the 
other girl. Said new arrival was currently facing the beast that my 
comrades had fought without much success, yet she radiated calmness 
and a confidence for victory that should really not be present.
	I was in no position to comment though as I could only watch 
transfix while the redheaded figure began a strange chant that sounded 
Japanese to my ears but had an ancient quality and was laced with a 
force to be reckoned with. Even as the stranger began the chant, 
Saturn had already pulled us back with a urgency that I let myself be 
dragged obediently without even a thought of complaint. Far enough 
away, she erected a barrier of such strength that I was dreading to 
see what would prompt her to take such desperate measures. I would not 
have to wait long...
	&quot;Tasogare yori mo kuraki mono, chi no nagare yori akaki mono
	Toki no nagare ni umoreshi idainaru nannji no na ni oite
	Ware koko ni yami ni chikawan
	Wareraga mae ni tatifusagarishi subete no orokanaru mono ni
	Ware to nanji ga chikara mote hitoshiku horobi o ataen koto o&quot;
	The other girl had her hands cupped around a glowing orb of red 
power, radiating an unholy light of such potent destructive energy it 
made me shudder even from the considerable distance between us. And 
then, with two final words, the spell was completed and the 
authorities of Minato-ku would be at a loss to explain the source of 
the infernal explosion enveloping the market area just a moment later.
	&quot;DRAGON SLAVE!&quot;
	I had to shield my eyes from the intense burst of crimson light 
washing over the globe of Saturn&#39;s barrier with the force of a raging 
tsunami. I felt something tug at the edges of my awareness, a 
recognition that was similar to what I got from my past life 
sometimes. But that wasn&#39;t about my life as Princess Venus. I should 
presume that I would be aware of knowing someone who could pull of 
something like that. No, it was older, a figment of memory that I had 
been having quite a lot as of later, ever since the night of revealing 
my condition to Makoto and Hotaru. And not knowing what all that meant 
drove me to serious distraction!
	Right now I was much more amazed and taken in by the scene of 
carnal destruction all around us when the smoke cleared and Saturn 
dropped her barrier with a groan of clear exhaustion. While my 
tactical mind dully took note of the level of control applied to the 
magical equivalent to a nuclear bomb - having effected ONLY the market 
area and leaving the surrounding buildings with only superficial 
damages - I could not help but being stupefied at the sheer power to 
the disposal of one human being and so young at that. &quot;Oh shit,&quot; I 
accurately stated my initial thoughts.
	&quot;Holy...&quot; Jupiter breathed, blinking furiously as if trying to 
determine whether or not her senses were playing a trick on her and I 
was sourly tempted to follow that example, not quite WANTING to 
believe the undeniable truth in front of our eyes. Saturn&#39;s words 
though managed to momentarily divide our attention.
	&quot;Hmm, that was a rather small one. Seems like her reincarnation 
isn&#39;t all that destructive.&quot; I blinked in stunned disbelief at that 
comment and I doubt it was necessary for either Jupiter or me to even 
ask what the outcome had been if the girl hadn&#39;t been - as Saturn put 
it - &quot;all that destructive.&quot; I visibly shuddered at the implications.
	&quot;You keep interesting company, Hotaru-chan,&quot; Jupiter commented. 
The smoke had cleared by now and there was no trace of the creature, 
leaving just the cloaked girl standing in the center, slowly lowering 
her arms.
	&quot;You used to know her?&quot; I asked dubiously, still remembering the 
spark of memory and for a brief moment curiosity got the better of me 
instead of the usual routine of denying those strange flashbacks. I 
really didn&#39;t need yet ANOTHER life impacting on me but anyone who 
could blow up an entire area was quite intriguing...not to mention a 
force to be reckoned with should she turn out to be less than 
friendly.
	Of course it was too much to ask for just a few more months more 
peace, wasn&#39;t it?
	&quot;Hai, we used to, Peitho,&quot; Saturn answered, meeting the gaze of 
the golden-eyed girl directly as she turned around to face us. I was 
momentarily distracted by that strange and magnificent color but then 
Saturn&#39;s words began to filter through.
	&quot;Eh? What do you mean &quot;we&quot; and... matte, what did you call me 
just now?&quot; There had been a powerful spark that I wasn&#39;t able to deny. 
A trigger of some sorts, similar to remembering Serenity&#39;s name in my 
battle with Adonis had ignited the memories of my past life on the 
Moon. This name was... it felt... right. A familiar sensation coursed 
through me, momentarily pushing away my awareness as Aino Minako 
before...
	I violently pushed it back. Just like the dreams, the flashes, 
the madness of the last month and a half that was straining my sanity. 
I did not need this. I knew who I was and what I wanted of life. I had 
had enough weirdness to deal with already to add yet another one. I 
could control my fate! Usagi had shown us that we were not totally 
subjected to it and I wasn&#39;t going to be deterred from my path...
	My mind snapped back to the present when I caught something on 
the edge of my perception and before any of us could react grayish... 
matter flowed together into a similar blob shape as the creature had 
been at the begin of the battle and the next instant it vaulted away 
at incredible speed, vanishing faster than any of us could even take a 
breath.
	&quot;It&#39;s still alive?&quot; Jupiter commented in disbelief even as the 
cloaked figure launched into action and was gone after it - or so I 
suspected - the next moment. Saturn tried to call out to her but to no 
avail.
	&quot;Well...&quot; I said after a few moments of silence. &quot;That was 
interesting.&quot; I regretted drawing attention right away as I found 
myself on the receiving end of twin glares that didn&#39;t bode well for 
me at all. The two Senshi&#39;s transformations fading away, Makoto looked 
really furious while Hotaru was... indifferent, but in a way that was 
truly scary, a cold fury just lurking underneath the surface.
	&quot;You call that interesting? What the hell were you doing here?&quot;
	I shuddered slightly at the cold voice even while trained eyes 
took in the slight tremors of her body that surely were no good sign. 
Still, I felt compelled to even try defend my point. Those two were 
treating me like I was made of porcelain these last weeks just because 
of that baby. Their fussing was really getting to me. &quot;Oh, for the 
love of it! Would you just let me do what I want to do? I can&#39;t just 
stay scooped up all day at home and do nothing! I need something to do 
or I&#39;ll go crazy!&quot;
	&quot;So you go and get yourself a job with the police chasing 
thieves who turn into monsters,&quot; Makoto cut in dryly.
	I actually flushed at that. It was true that I had called in a 
favor from Chief Sakurada but I thought it would be an easy thing. 
Only normal criminals after all. Nothing I couldn&#39;t handle with a 
minimum of physical exertion. &quot;Hey! How was I supposed to know...?&quot; My 
outburst was cut short rather violently and I actually staggered and 
fell on my rump, not so much from the force but from the sheer 
surprise of the slap.
	Any question died on my lips the moment I looked up to see 
Hotaru&#39;s face just inches away from mine. My throat felt dry but not 
so much from the closeness and the curious myriad of feelings this 
sparked in me. No, the expression on her face was horribly mesmerizing 
and I felt my heart clench at the desperation and fear mingled with a 
few tears, all directed at me. &quot;Baka...&quot; Hotaru pressed out, her voice 
shaking with more emotion than I had ever seen in the dark-haired 
girl. &quot;Who are you trying to impress with this recklessness? Can&#39;t you 
for once acknowledge that there are people who love YOU and who don&#39;t 
want to see YOU hurt. How do you think I felt when I saw you there, 
almost getting killed? What do you think I would have done, had I just 
been a moment too late... I... I...&quot; And with an abruptness that 
shattered the thrall the storm of emotions in her eyes had held over 
me, Hotaru looked away, getting shakily on her feet. &quot;I... I&#39;ll go 
find Lina...&quot; With a glance in Makoto&#39;s direction who had followed all 
this silently with a surprisingly impassive expression, she added, 
&quot;Take her home.&quot;
	And with that Hotaru was gone and I was left sitting where I 
was, not really comprehending what had just happened. But one thing I 
knew for sure. I felt immense guilt after being on the receiving end 
of such an emotional outburst from the normally levelheaded Hotaru.
	&quot;Can&#39;t say I don&#39;t agree with her, Mina-chan. Really, I thought 
you said you know that she loves you - and that&#39;s actually putting it 
nicely. And there you go and do something stupid like that.&quot;
	&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; I started before trailing off and looking 
in the vague direction where Hotaru had vanished, feeling rather numb 
at the moment.

******************************

(Lisa)
Grumbling dark things about the unfairness of life I sat in my room, 
hunched over application papers from several renown colleges and 
universities. When I had sent all those out a couple of months ago 
after coming to Japan, it had been more a precautious move. I had 
honestly not expected to get explicit invitations from ALL of them. I 
really didn&#39;t pay much mind to my studies, a lot of things came 
naturally to me. I knew that other kids at my old schools regarded me 
as overly intelligent and the word &quot;nerd&quot; fell more than one time. I 
didn&#39;t care at all. School wasn&#39;t my true calling, neither was 
anything that my parents would have wanted me to become. I had other 
gifts that were worth exploring.
	Therefore the choice in the end was already made the moment I 
opened the first reply letter. The all-grades school had caught my eye 
right away when I was looking for some place to take up my studies 
again which had been rather neglected in the last years. While I 
didn&#39;t like school all that much, I didn&#39;t want to fall behind either, 
I had enough good sense after all to realize that my future chances 
would most likely shrink considerably without some good grades. And 
Neo Infinity was just perfect. Frankly the public opinion was rather 
diverse about the &quot;occult&quot; school of &quot;necromancers&quot; or some of the 
milder critics had been worded. However, I was never one to listen to 
the opinion of others. Sometimes humans were only satisfied when they 
had something that they could take apart to their heart&#39;s content, the 
result not very much resembling the term &quot;constructive criticism&quot;. I 
had made my own investigations and was pretty much certain that this 
one was just what I wanted.
	Of course, Neo Infinity - as much as its predecessor from what I 
had gathered - demanded a high standard, accepting only those that 
were gifted AND who could uphold a stellar grade average, or so was my 
impression. Which meant I had to actually STUDY.
	Not that my grade average wasn&#39;t enough. The problem was that I 
had missed a lot of school while traveling abroad, only staying in one 
location once in awhile that allowed me to apply to a school. I 
usually had a good grasp on things and could pick up new stuff 
quickly, yet the absence had left a couple of black holes in my 
general education that could prove a problem.
	In short, I was frustrated with being scooped up in here for the 
last several months. Granted, I hadn&#39;t felt like indulging in my usual 
passion for adventure after arriving here. Events back home had left a 
scar on my soul that had taken time to even begin healing. And now I 
had to stick my nose in boring books whenever I found time between my 
usual chores and helping Babasan.
	&quot;My life sucks,&quot; I stated dryly, returning the stack of papers 
to their folder. I didn&#39;t even know why I had looked at them. Maybe it 
was a temporary spark of interest brought about by the fact that most 
of the other colleges and universities would not require that much 
preparation. Well, nothing comes without a price.
	&quot;That is a rather melodramatic opinion, Mistress.&quot; I glanced up, 
actually glad for the distraction as the opal ring on my right ring 
finger flashed and a wisp-like substance formed over it before 
materializing in a miniature version of the one... creature who I 
could call a permanent friend and companion in the last years. The 
figure was semi-translucent and resembled a winged woman with long 
light blue hair and a set of inhuman white eyes, blazing with both 
quiet power and wisdom.
	&quot;Easy for you to say, Soyo-chan,&quot; I replied. &quot;You don&#39;t have to 
deal with all that stuff.&quot; I chuckled in spite of the pout I was 
intending, my mood considerably lightened already by the calming 
presence of the wind elemental. &quot;I...&quot; Suddenly there was a rumbling 
sound in the distant, sounded an awfully lot like an explosion. 
Moments later all that wasn&#39;t rooted to the ground shook slightly as 
an aftershock rippled over the Astral Plane and was effecting the 
physical world in the process. My trained senses took note of a vast 
power eruption just seconds before my vision blurred...
	The images were familiar ones by now, as were most of the people 
shown. Especially the redheaded woman and the regal-looking 
dark-haired one with curious child-like features. This time though it 
was just images of the redhead, intruding on my mind despite my best 
efforts.
	The scenes were hard to make sense of in the rapid fashion they 
blurred from one into another with not much direct connection. More 
like photos from someone else&#39;s vacation where you could only guess 
what was going on without having that someone describe the details. 
First where was the redhead and myself - or at least I suspected it 
was me - facing off with a dark-haired... child who for some reason 
sent shivers down my spine as if the boy was the very devil in 
disguise. The redhead shot a powerful, destructive beam of crimson 
energy at the child and a few moments later I did the same.
	The scene changed and I saw the same girl basked in a golden 
aura standing atop a piece of rubble and then ascending towards the 
heavens.
	The next one seemed to be in a setting resembling the room of an 
inn and I watched in fascination as the girl and my other self seemed 
to discuss something heatedly - I really wished I could actually hear 
them talk! - and after some time I advanced on the nervous redhead who 
seemed to be torn between the instinct of flight and submitting to 
whatever was to come. Eventually the latter happened and the string 
of... well, whatever it was ended with the conclusion of seeing myself 
and the other girl locked in what was soon to become hesitant 
foreplay...
	I came back to reality with a start and was sure I could 
actually feel the heat from my cheeks. Some of those last images had 
been rather graphic already and... &quot;Gah!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;I really need 
to figure this out.&quot; I turned around to see Soyokaze floating next to 
the window, her head turned towards me with a concerned look. &quot;Are you 
alright, Mistress?&quot;
	&quot;No,&quot; I stated bluntly, shaking my head to clear the sensation 
of dizziness usually following those experiences.
	&quot;I take it then, you had another flashback?&quot; the wind elemental 
asked with a note of sympathy in her voice.
	I could only nod in response. This was getting beyond 
frustrating. I had by now figured out that the flashes and dreams most 
likely were hidden memories of a past life, my training in several 
spiritual aspects told me as much. I had them for awhile now, on and 
off over the last four years, actually ever since that few months I 
had spent here at the shrine during my travels. Something happened 
then, I had FELT it. Something had changed and that change had 
unlocked a hidden part of my being. Ever since then I had tried to 
figure it out, even gone so far as meditating on those memories and 
consciously drawing them forth. However, that had been denied to me 
for reasons even Soyokaze couldn&#39;t figure out. It was almost as if 
something was dampening those memories and that was why they only came 
in incoherent, incomplete flashes.
	Getting up I walked over to the window and glanced out. I 
squinted my eyes at the fine smoke that came from the direction of one 
of the market areas of Minato-ku. Then I opened myself to the Astral 
Plane and focused upon this area. While not nearly as good at that as 
many others I had met, even those with a limited understanding of 
magic could pick out the remaining traces of something rather dark and 
purely destructive in nature. I whistled slightly at the potency of 
the magic unleashed just seconds ago.
	&quot;Yes, quite impressive. I wonder who could command such forces 
in this age?&quot; the Sylph mused.
	&quot;That I would like to know myself,&quot; I responded, silently 
resolving to myself that I would get to the bottom of this. It was 
time I took a more active role with those memories since sitting 
around and meditating on them was not likely to get me anywhere closer 
to enlightenment.

******************************

(Minako)
The trip back home was spent mostly in silence for which I was 
eternally grateful. My belly was demanding attention from the 
unexpected exertion - alright already, overexertion - and Hotaru&#39;s 
actions were still hauntingly present in my mind, invoking strange 
feelings that as much as I tried to ignore them were leaking guilt and 
shame to my mind. I had never seen Hotaru that angry and the scary 
part was that it felt more like Saturn resorting to such an emotional 
outburst. The cold, collected, always dutiful and focused Saturn... I 
was fairly sure that would have even given Pluto pause if directed her 
way.
	I was sincerely relieved when I could finally sit down and relax 
my body that was more tired than I had calculated from the activity. 
Okay, granted that hadn&#39;t been the smartest idea I ever had but I had 
not expected something like this happening. My first days after 
getting the job from my old friend had been rather eventless, regular 
and mostly minor crime not proving to be not much of a problem for 
someone who usually tended to focus her attention and abilities on 
supernatural creatures. It was of course just my luck that I had to 
met one of those in my line of duty at exactly the time when I was 
spotted by Makoto...
	&quot;What do you think that was all about?&quot; I broke the silence 
after a long time, accepting the cup of herbal tea from Makoto without 
resistance, knowing by now that such a notion would be futile. I took 
a sip and let the warm, carefully balanced liquid fill my being and 
relieve some of the strain.
	&quot;I&#39;m not sure. Something has been in the air for some time now,&quot; 
Makoto said quietly, more to herself than actually addressing me. I 
was not dumb enough to debate the point anyway. Despite everything 
that happened I took my duties seriously and while I had not Makoto&#39;s 
bond with nature or Rei&#39;s spiritual abilities, my senses were honed 
and sharp. And the brunette definitely had a point in saying that 
something was clearly amiss. I think everyone of us had picked up on 
this in their own special way.
	&quot;However,&quot; Makoto said sharply, sitting down opposite from me 
and fixing me with a look that as much said that the temporary peace 
was over and there was going to be trouble for me. I shifted 
uncomfortable under the emerald-eyed stare that I felt unable to 
completely ward off with resolve alone. &quot;Do not try to change the 
topic here. I&#39;m sure Hotaru-chan will get to the bottom of that 
business. You though, young lady, you have some explaining to do.&quot; 
Makoto crossed her arms and waited expectedly.
	I gave a long sigh of resignation. &quot;Alright. What do you want to 
hear? That I&#39;m sorry? That I know how stupid that was? Believe me, I 
can feel the idiocy of my actions right now.&quot; I winced slightly at a 
particular sting and took a few more sips before continuing.
	&quot;But is it enough to prevent this from happening in the future?&quot; 
Makoto asked sternly with an expression that as much as dared me to 
respond in the negative. It was that tone of voice that... that... 
aloofness, the way both her and Hotaru were trying to direct my life 
as THEY thought was the best way that managed to rally my own temper, 
greatly enhanced through my pregnant state.
	And so I once again fell into the familiar pattern that usually 
only ended in unintended hurt feelings to sort out later. &quot;Would you 
stop patronizing me all the time? It&#39;s my life to do with as I see 
fit. I just can&#39;t do nothing all day long, that&#39;s not my style and you 
of all people should know that, Makoto!&quot; My voice rose with each 
sentence and while on a detached level I was aware that I was digging 
my own grave deeper and deeper with every moment, I couldn&#39;t stop. 
&quot;For the past month you have been constantly fussing ober me. I can 
barely do a single thing by myself before one of you is there and 
takes it away, at once assuming the task is too straining for me. I am 
not made of paper tissue, you know? I can very well care for 
myself...&quot;
	&quot;And we know that,&quot; Makoto interjected calmly, which only served 
to further infuriate me since the part that was fed up with how things 
progressed lately was actually seeking a verbal confrontation to vent 
all those pent up feelings. &quot;We are not trying to dictate your life 
but pregnancy is a serious thing and unless you want to give the kid 
up - which we have agreed on is not an issue - then you have to take 
more care of yourself. Hotaru and I love you very much and in spite of 
what you are...&quot;
	I didn&#39;t let her finish as an indefinable urge rose up inside of 
me that contained all the frustration, helplessness and absurdity of 
the last months that had turned my life upside down and left me 
wondering what exactly was what in my existence. My values and outlook 
on life had been seriously rattled and I had no idea how to properly 
deal with all this. Combined this complex web of emotions served to 
let the one thing slip from my lips that I knew was as much a gross 
denial as it was the most heartless thing to say in this situation. 
&quot;Love?&quot; I snorted. &quot;Right, do you even hear what you are saying? For 
Kami&#39;s sake, you both declare that you love me and at the same time 
you manage to maintain your own relationship. Do you realize how 
stupid that sounds? And I don&#39;t know why I should feel bound to you 
because of that. I happen to know what love is and this whole farce is 
the furthest away from it that I...&quot;
	My rant was brought to a stumbling closure when Makoto stood up 
so suddenly that the two cups on the table shook, coming dangerously 
close to spilling their content - which I am not sure I would have 
even taken note of. My brunette friend emitted a low growl from her 
throat and I could detect the faint spark of her battle aura barely 
kept in check. &quot;Don&#39;t. Ever. Again. Belittle. Our. Feelings.&quot; There 
was the sound of thunder rolling in the distance but I was too 
transfixed by the sight of almost seeing tears slip from Makoto&#39;s eyes 
that I paid much mind if my senses were just playing tricks on me. &quot;If 
you want to stay in your delusion and rather cling to the notion that 
you have to force love to come to you rather than accept it when 
offered, please go ahead, I am not stopping you. But if you one more 
time as much as speak ill of what I feel and especially of what Hotaru 
feels about you, you WILL regret it.&quot; I was unable to reply in the 
face of such fury, different from the emotional reaction of Hotaru 
earlier, more forceful and direct. &quot;You think you don&#39;t need us?&quot; 
Makoto turned around sharply and strode towards the exit. &quot;Fine! Let&#39;s 
see how long it takes you to come crawling and begging for us to help 
you!&quot;
	And with a finality that made me jump Makoto slammed the door to 
the living room behind her. Several moments passed and then the 
distant sound of the front door fairing not better than the previous 
one finally managed to kick start some brain activity and with that, 
the fire in me pretty much extinguished by now, the realization of 
what just happened began to fully register.
	&quot;Baka!&quot; I cursed, the term not directed at Makoto but at myself. 
I punched into the soft material of the couch which yielded easily, 
much to my further frustration. I clenched my eyes shut and tried to 
push back the tide of emotions threatening to overwhelm my mind. 
Burying my head into various cushions I fully intended to sulk in my 
self-made misery for awhile.

******************************

&lt;ca. 200002 BC, close to the rise of the Silver Millennium ()&gt;
Saillune, capital of White Magic. The entire city was build on a node 
- a nexus of realities - and shaped like a magic circle, thus 
intensifying holy energy. Mazoku or other such creatures who fed upon 
negative emotions found their powers considerably diminished. Not so 
much as to totally ward against the more powerful but enough to create 
a certain unease. During and before the Resurrection War - or as 
commonly termed the &quot;War of the Monsters&#39; Fall&quot; - Saillune was 
renowned for the concentration of shrine maidens that could pull of a 
holy spell as good as any Golden Dragon. This tradition had continued 
but the Holy lore was lost since the war of the war. The god-sealing 
field and the millennia that elapsed since then had reduced the famous 
shrine maidens and other White Magic practitioners to a mere shadow of 
their old selves.
	The holy ground stood firm and protected the city and to a 
degree the surrounding country through even those dark times and now, 
upon the threat of something even far greater a menace to the world - 
and not only the human society at that - Saillune stood once again 
firm, like a shelter in the raging storm outside its walls. Several 
factors were responsible for that state. For one, the god-sealing 
field was gone, annihilated along with Hellmaster Phibrizo and Chaos 
Dragon Gaav at the hand of Lina Inverse and her friends. The other 
reason was also because of those courageous band of teenagers, or 
young adults now, mainly the triad regiment that had been established 
over the last few years. It had been a long road for the young Queen 
Amelia Wil Tesla Saillune. Almost overnight she had to don the mantle 
of the ruler of one of the biggest kingdoms known on their continent 
after the - to everyone&#39;s surprise - successful assassination on her 
father Philionel. However, with the support and love - as was common 
knowledge even though never officially stated - of her friends and 
comrades Lina Inverse and Sylphiel Nels Lahda, Amelia managed to 
establish peace between most of the various kingdoms, dukedoms and 
whatnot on the continent. She became a very beloved ruler by the 
people, as did her companions. A loyalty and faith that was now as 
much encouraging as it put a particular pressure on the rulers.
	&#39;A rather weird arrangement&#39;, thought Lady Phoebe as she stood 
with her own delegation facing the royal trio in the courtyard of the 
definitely magnificent - but not excessive - palace. &#39;Not that I can&#39;t 
see the affection.&#39; The dark-haired Phoebe glanced to her left to the 
see the taller blonde woman on the other side of the flanking position 
they maintained for their younger charges. Lady Peitho sensed the gaze 
of her companion and soul mate and at once shot back a smile and a 
hooded gaze that was pretty much openly suggestive. &#39;That&#39;s what you 
get for getting involved with the Senshi of Love&#39;, Phoebe mused but 
turned her attention back towards the upcoming meeting.
	If one did not know that there was a far greater amount of pure 
souls that were female and that those were more adept in harnessing 
and understanding their given powers it would probably seem odd to any 
casual observer. Seeing as both main groups facing each other were 
mostly of the fairer sex. On the two Senshi&#39;s side were the two 
younger woman - barely out of adolescence - in their center with their 
distinctive hair colors of a deep gold-blonde and light blue bound in 
similar odango styles. And then there was the tall blonde woman of 
course, in her white robes she stood a couple of centimeters higher 
than even Lady Peitho. At her side was a young boy, maybe a decade or 
a little more old, who had green, somewhat spiky hair and seemed to 
take in everything with a curiosity and intelligence that appeared to 
be more than a boy his age should possess.
	On the other side there were, of course, the three ruling bodies 
of Saillune. The (in-)famous Lina Inverse was garbed in red and black 
robes that were neither overly ceremonial as they were casual, her 
orange-red hair was longer than Phoebe remembered the various rumors 
and myths tended to describe, bound in a ponytail that fell just a 
little over her shoulders. On the other side was Sylphiel Nels Lahda, 
who was supposed to be the best human healer the world or at least 
this continent had ever seen, with the rediscovery of the Holy lore 
her skill had actually increased or so Phoebe conceived from a brief 
analysis of her aura. She wore a formal attire in a curious contrast 
of white and black. In their midst was the dark-haired Amelia, 
probably one of the youngest Queens Saillune had ever seen but 
radiating a quiet confidence and firmness in her beliefs that made her 
the kind of popular ruler she was today. Instead of the traditional 
white of Saillune royality, Amelia had chosen a light bluish garb that 
reflected her competence in all three magic categories but especially 
the spiritual lore. It was hard to believe that the kind yet still 
regal appearing woman was said to be somewhat of a klutz preaching the 
kind of beliefs that a lot of Saillune&#39;s royals were (in-)famous for 
and had earned the one or other ridiculing comment in the past. 
Looking at her now, Phoebe saw a mature woman, hardened by the trials 
of life, that had maintained a refreshing kindness.
	So it was to no great surprise - at least not to Phoebe - that 
Serenity, the young blonde woman in their midst, moved forward and 
instead of a series of formal greeting, bows and diplomatic 
compliments, her and Queen Amelia met in the center, waiting only a 
heartbeat, before Serenity extended her hand with a smile. Everyone 
who didn&#39;t have a good grasp on both sides involved or a good skill to 
perceive an individual&#39;s natures face-faulted at the young woman&#39;s 
manner of greeting. &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Serenity. It is nice to finally meet 
you.&quot;
	Almost without missing a beat, Amelia took the offered hand and 
shook it. &quot;And I am Amelia. I am glad to finally meet you as well.&quot;
	Phoebe shared a private smile of affection with Peitho, while 
Serenity&#39;s sister, the blue-haired Tsunami, just shook her head in 
good-natured annoyance. Out of the corner of her eye, Phoebe could see 
the tall blonde woman, the (former) dragon priestess Filia also form a 
smile of affection and with a note of knowledge which was not so 
surprising given that she had known both of the young royal heirs. She 
noticed though that Filia&#39;s gaze seemed to linger on Lina Inverse for 
a moment with a touch of sadness before returning back to the 
situation at hand and the following greetings and introductions that 
were not as formal as some might have expected.

******************************

&lt;Present Time (Hotaru)&gt;
The moment of our first meeting had been a peaceful and relaxed one in 
a situation that was anything but. Frankly I wondered if any of us 
would have met without the world - and pretty much the whole universe 
- being in jeopardy from the mad&#39;woman&#39; who had come from practical 
nowhere, raining terror on the worlds. Peitho, the Venus of this era, 
and I had had some warning of her arrival but not nearly as much as we 
would have liked. The two of us together with our young charges, the 
orphan princesses of a destroyed kingdom, Serenity and Tsunami, had 
lived in a valley high in the Kataart Mountains where a mixed tribe 
had formed throughout the last years and if not for the menace that 
came over the unsuspecting Earth we might have never met with the 
three girls and their associated friends.
	The memories came back to me full force. Not that they were 
forgotten or something, but right now they were even more present. The 
war that ensured for our very survival had ended in the birth of the 
Silver Millennium but also had caused many sacrifices... including 
Lina Inverse and her mates. They had been the key elements for an 
ancient seal that was supposed to hold the creature known only by the 
aptly name of Pandora. Supposed to.
	As I raced the rooftops, pushing back the sudden swell of 
emotions I had shown in front of Minako, I could not help but reflect 
how much elements seemed to fall into place that supported my theory, 
a fearful theory at that. Usagi was so much like the first Serenity, 
as was Minako. Then there was Sasami who I could not help but hazard 
could very well be Tsunami - either reborn or in some other way. Rei&#39;s 
young charge was definitely shielding herself well, making it hard to 
confirm that theory but in effect only supporting it at the same time 
since there were few people who could elude my senses as long as she 
did. And now there was the Seeker, a favorable minion of Pandora in 
what we dubbed the Revolution War. If that wasn&#39;t enough though, 
Lina&#39;s incarnation showing up when she did made the vague fear a very 
close possibility.
	That wasn&#39;t not much of an improvement in the line of thinking 
compared to my own love life troubles.
	Somehow I wasn&#39;t even surprised finding myself near the center 
of the Infinity polder and close to the school. I could have hit 
myself for not realizing this earlier. I HAD seen that girl before. 
More in passing than anything else but still... She was the student 
head of magical lore as far as I knew. I was specializing in different 
areas and thus had not that much to do with that wing but I could 
swear that she pretty much always was in the company of Infinity&#39;s 
junior partner, Daidouji Tomoyo whose mother had helped to found the 
entire project. &#39;Great, talk about being oblivious.&#39; I had never paid 
them much mind, especially, seeing as we had a strict anonymity 
policy, and while I did help at times, Setsuna managed the 
applications.
	Levitating up to the top of Neo Infinity my analysis was proven 
by finding not only Lina but also Daidouji up there, looking as if 
they were expecting me. Once again I wondered why I had never noticed 
before but while outwardly with some vast differences, Daidouji bore 
many of the spiritual traits of Queen Amelia... &#39;I suppose it&#39;s just 
the situation and the many factors combined&#39;, I mused as I touched 
down on the roof, the wind whipping up my hair at this high an 
altitude. &#39;It&#39;s not like you usually go around looking at people and 
guessing whose incarnation they might be.&#39; I chuckled lightly, 
managing to break the silence that had elapsed for a few moments.
	&quot;What is so funny, Tomoe-san,&quot; Daidouji asked, not at all 
disapproving but merely curious.
	I hardly blinked as I replied, &quot;Oh, just thinking about why I 
never realized who the two of you were even though we hardly see each 
other, Daidouji-san...&quot; I hesitated while turning a look in Lina&#39;s 
direction. &quot;I am afraid you have me at a disadvantage. By what name do 
you go these days?&quot;
	&quot;Kinomoto Sakura. But just Sakura will do since we are all 
familiar with each other here... after a fashion.&quot; She smiled slightly 
and I joined into the private joke that helped to further alleviate 
the tension. Not that I had the feeling this was going to be a 
permanent condition for very long. As if in answer to my unspoken 
question, Lina... Sakura sighed. &quot;The Seeker got away if you are 
wondering about that. We lost the trail around this area, must be the 
node.&quot;
	&quot;I was having doubts myself if it was such a good idea to 
rebuild the school in the same location. While the zone has been 
cleansed, it is still containing high potential that can have 
advantages for just about anyone,&quot; I thought aloud. &quot;But enough of 
that. Would you like to tell me what is going on? I have an idea 
already, however, I&#39;m not sure I want to voice it before I&#39;m entirely 
certain - as I am sure you can best understand.&quot;
	The two girls traded a look before Daidouji spoke. &quot;We very well 
can and we are sorry to confirm your obvious suspicions. It is indeed 
Pandora who is trying to break through the ancient seal and she&#39;s 
closer to it when we would like.&quot;
	Despite being prepared for that answer I could not suppress the 
shudder. All who had ever faced this creature would know why even the 
Senshi of Silence was reacting this way. Even before I could voice an 
objection or ask for details, Kinomoto was taking over the 
conversation, providing me with just that.
	&quot;I am not sure you are familiar with my work, so I make this as 
short as possible. A couple of centuries ago there was a great 
sorcerer named Clow Reed. He created a rather innovative kind of magic 
through the use of cards that bound various elements or even physical 
abilities. The Clow Cards are in fact rather similar to an elemental 
spirit in nature if you want a simple explanation. In doing so, Clow 
unknowingly tempered with forces that he could not perceive.&quot; At that 
Lina&#39;s incarnation held up two cards to my inspection with the 
particular names &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Silence&quot; written on them. At first I did 
not fully comprehend but when Sakura explained further, I began to 
understand the unpleasant reality. &quot;Clow bound part of the power that 
made up the outer layer of Pandora&#39;s seal which you and Peitho 
provided back then.&quot;
	I gasped, grasping easily what that could mean but Kinomoto 
continued before I could make my displeasure known - not that that was 
necessary. &quot;Clow was unable to undo the damage, so he put the cards 
back into the seal in a steady orbit. Yet, the flawless state of the 
layer was lost and Pandora was eventually able to break free of the 
seal roughly a few weeks ago...&quot;
	I&#39;m pretty sure my heart had stopped for a second there before 
Amelia&#39;s present self interjected smoothly, &quot;Relatively speaking that 
is. You have to know that Sakura here actually lived her childhood 
twice. She returned from her ordeal in a different timeline, one where 
our ancient enemy has already escaped, in order to fix things.&quot;
	&#39;Returned from her...?&#39; &quot;I think Pluto is going to have a fit if 
she learns about this,&quot; I commented dryly, getting over my momentary 
shock. I didn&#39;t even want to know what would happen if that monster 
had truly been released already. In the state the Senshi - especially 
Venus, Jupiter and I - were now she&#39;d eat us for breakfast. Dreading 
what was yet to come I fixed the two girls with a look of steady 
resolve - though underneath that mask I was more effected already than 
anyone who knew me would suspect. &quot;Go on.&quot;

******************************

(Artemis)
At this point, I decided for myself that this had continued long 
enough. I had observed those three for the past month, never making as 
much as a comment on the situation. It was not my place anyway. But 
the sight of my charge on the edge of emotional exhaustion was killing 
me on the inside, literally. Almost a decade of partnership was a long 
time even without adding several more in a past life to it. The 
emotional bonds between us were tight, probably tighter than between 
Venus and me in the Silver Millennium. And I should be damned if I 
refused to be there for Minako in a situation like this because she 
grew up and seemingly doesn&#39;t need me anymore. That was nonsense. 
Anyone needed someone to lean onto sometimes, to allow their masks to 
fall around them. My problem was, I didn&#39;t know exactly how to give 
any good advise in that matter. Frankly, I believed that the only ones 
who had a chance of helping Minako would be the two girls from whom 
one of them just left pretty angry...
	Oh well, nothing gained without trying. Not wanting to startle 
my charge I opted not to shape-shift and instead remained in cat form 
while making my way up to the couch and the huddled form of misery 
there. Making my presence known I nudged Minako gently and when that 
failed to produce any reaction at all, I frowned. Not one to give up 
easily I nudged a little harder with one of my paws. The blonde just 
grumbled something inaudible and shifted slightly away, not giving any 
other acknowledgment.
	Getting annoyed by this display of unresponsiveness I growled 
low and waited a moment for a reaction. After that failed to produce 
one, I bared my sharp teeth and bit down on one hand.
	&quot;Youch! Artemis, are you crazy?! What was the big idea, you want 
to render me completely useless?&quot; I sat there and let the following 
rant fly right over my head. Actually the whole thing was kind of 
nostalgic, considering that we hadn&#39;t one really messy fight or 
argument in the last couple of years.
	&quot;There&#39;s nothing left to render useless anymore,&quot; I replied 
matter-of-factly, putting just the right amount of cynicism and subtle 
challenge into it to provoke exactly the reaction I wanted... at least 
if I could draw conclusion from the reaction of my neck hairs standing 
on end as if they had been electrocuted.
	There was a moment of silence, then an expression I had almost 
wondered I would ever see again in the near future crossed Minako&#39;s 
features, just before she asked with a dangerous edge to her voice, 
&quot;And what exactly is that supposed to mean?&quot;
	I feigned innocence and obliviousness while mentally preparing 
myself and tightening all my muscle for the inevitable physical 
exertion that would follow. &quot;Oh, I dunno. Just that the way you are 
now, you are a completely worthless mess of a leader who couldn&#39;t even 
lead an army of babies... Oh wait, you are getting one yourself, so 
you can&#39;t even fight properly and... Eep!&quot;
	&quot;ARTEMIS!!!&quot; an enraged woman&#39;s shout rang throughout the manor 
and the chase was on. I was in motion the moment Minako first lounged 
for me and used the long hallways and many rooms to my advantage as I 
did the most sensible thing and tried to keep ahead of the furious, 
raging blonde woman who right now didn&#39;t even show a sign of her 
physical condition. All the depression and melancholy was washed away 
to be replaced by vivid, fiery rage, the need for revenge, punishing 
the offending furball... or something along that line of thought. But 
underneath - as I could see in a brief moment - there also was a spark 
of amusement, a genuine... gladness. Subconsciously Minako knew 
exactly what I was doing and as much as she might want to sulk, I 
always had had my ways to pull her chain. Even by things she wouldn&#39;t 
even react to said by others. It was part of our special relationship, 
the partnership between us that was as close as a brother and sister 
might be, if not more. It was that relationship that made it 
impossible for Minako to resume her lethargy state, at the same time 
giving her an excuse to let go for a moment. Something she hadn&#39;t been 
able to do for a long, long time.
	I knew of course that despite the adrenaline rush, Minako&#39;s 
pregnant state wouldn&#39;t allow her to continue with that much longer 
and so, cutting back to our starting point, I eventually slowed down, 
submitting myself to the unpleasant fate of finding myself dangling 
upside-down from my tail in front of Minako&#39;s face who looked about 
ready to something really nasty to poor little me.
	&quot;Why you...&quot; Minako started but faltered when I let her see the 
little, silly grin I wore, her expression contorted for a moment 
before bursting in one last exclamation of fury, &quot;You made me do 
this!&quot; And not shortly afterwards my charge burst into uncontrollable 
giggles, flopping down on the couch, unable to keep standing or 
remaining her hold on my tail for which I was immensely grateful. That 
girl had a strong grip, I tell you...
	Waiting until Minako had calmed down again after a full minute 
or so, I watched with an expression of smug satisfaction that served 
to send her in another fit just upon seeing it. I smirked again, 
rather pleased with myself. If Luna had been there right then, she 
would no doubt make some sarcastic comment. Not that she&#39;d really mean 
it.
	&quot;Feeling better now?&quot; I asked, more serious but not able to 
completely hide the amusement from my voice. I jumped up to sit on the 
backrest, glancing down at the blonde who lay spread out and to spend 
out from chasing me around the house for several minutes and then 
laughing herself to distraction. &quot;Seems you are not that much of a 
lost case after all.&quot;
	&quot;Meanie,&quot; Minako grumbled but didn&#39;t bother to hide the 
affectionate smile and the gratitude shining in her eyes. I wasn&#39;t so 
na&iuml;ve as to believe that this would completely cure her. The idea here 
was to take Minako&#39;s mind off of her problems for a little while and 
providing her with an opportunity to let go of that self-control she 
was chaining herself with lately. &quot;I&#39;m gonna tell Luna about that.&quot;
	I flinched. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t?&quot;
	Minako smiled wickedly. &quot;Try me.&quot;
	I gulped visibly and then made my comeback. &quot;Then I&#39;ll tell her 
about your little escapade on the market today.&quot;
	The blonde&#39;s expression darkened visibly. &quot;That was low.&quot; I 
hoped I didn&#39;t go too far with that one but seeing Minako&#39;s mood turn 
more solemn while refraining from slipping back into melancholy I 
figured she might be ready to talk now. Or if not... I had some other 
methods in reserve to make her! &quot;How did you know about that anyway? 
We didn&#39;t actually say anything specific.&quot;
	&quot;I was in the communication center, checking some things,&quot; I 
replied, adjusting my own attitude to serve hers. &quot;I don&#39;t want to 
lecture you here since I&#39;m sure you got the point already that you 
messed up big time there.&quot; To that the young woman grimaced but didn&#39;t 
comment, silently agreeing. &quot;So tell me then, what is wrong with you 
recently?&quot;
	I think she almost laughed at the question but eventually it 
came out more as a snort. I could hear several different comebacks on 
the tip of her tongue but neither of them made it out since Minako 
knew without even a conscious thought that she couldn&#39;t dish me some 
no-nonsense crap. &quot;Do I really need to tell you?&quot; was what Minako 
finally retorted, stating the simple fact that it really wasn&#39;t 
necessary for her to spell every syllable to someone who knew her 
better than her own family - not that this would be a grandiose 
accomplishment.
	&quot;Maybe not. But maybe it&#39;ll help, admitting it to yourself,&quot; I 
said softly.
	&quot;I doubt that.&quot; Minako paused for a moment and I half feared she 
would leave it at that and not budge on the point here. I fixed her 
with a stern gaze and didn&#39;t let up until she sighed heavily. &quot;Alright 
already. Let&#39;s talk.&quot;

******************************

(Makoto)
My mood definitely hadn&#39;t improved since leaving the manor. Upon 
coming home I had immediately sought out the small room on our floor 
that had been cleared for a meditation/training room. It was sort of a 
favor from the owner of the apartment block. I&#39;ve been here so long, 
we were practically on a first name basis these days and when he found 
out that I was taking serious Martial Arts training he had promptly 
cleared some space in an old storage room that was barely used these 
days anyway and served no conscious purpose whatsoever. Normally I 
wouldn&#39;t even use it myself. Most of the time I was either doing my 
katas in the morning on the balcony or just regulated those activities 
to Senshi or my usual Martial Arts training sessions.
	There were, however, occasion where I needed to relieve some 
build-up stress or I needed some quiet space to meditate, then I would 
come here. The chi flows were cleansed through earlier visits and thus 
the small room had obtained a kind of purity that not only aided in 
concentration but also did it absorb negative emotions like access 
anger and frustration.
	Motions flowing into each other it didn&#39;t even matter that I was 
physically exhausted from the brief battle with that abnormally strong 
creature. The katas weren&#39;t forceful or truly straining. Martial Arts 
was just what it said, an art, a dance that was teaching the body to 
move in perfection, brought to the height of its abilities and beyond. 
The motions weren&#39;t fast but they weren&#39;t slow either, perfectly 
coordinated, achieving an inner harmony that was supposed to calm the 
mind and bring things into focus.
	There were a lot of things that needed to be brought into focus. 
The argument with Minako had left me helpless and angry, angry at her 
for making me worry so much and then saying the things she did, but 
also angry at myself for reacting the way I did. It was childish. I 
let my anger get the better of myself. True I never was as good 
resolving a situation with words as I was with fists, but I had 
actually prided myself with having become a lot calmer over the years, 
especially around this tight-knit group I was honored to call my 
family.
	I had known Minako for so long. We had done a lot together 
in-between crisis. Everyday stuff, normal things teenager our age did. 
Shopping, watching movies, planning parties. Minako used to be such a 
big party girl. She still was whenever she let herself. But those 
instances became less and less frequent in the last years. I thought I 
understood part of the problem but now I wondered if I ever truly did. 
Still, there was no need to overreact like this. I knew what demands 
life was putting on her right now, both self-induced and beyond her 
control. It pained me to see my friend and not-so-secret-anymore love 
make herself miserable with struggles she herself probably knew were 
useless on a level. I never was the emotional expert either and so I 
had trouble talking about it which often produced reactions like the 
one just now.
	Surprisingly enough, Hotaru - quiet, shy Hotaru - was far better 
at rationally unraveling emotional issues. It had been her who had 
taken the first step towards our own tentative relationship, an action 
I wouldn&#39;t have dared for a very long time, if ever. It had been her 
who had come to get Minako to accept - at least in some small way - 
our help. That was what really made me furious anyway. Hotaru was 
making so many sacrifices for Minako, enduring indifference and 
annoyance at the offered help she really didn&#39;t deserve. The blonde&#39;s 
comment had briefly overridden every control and drew out reactions I 
regretted now. Hotaru would have handled that one better, she 
definitely got Minako to think with that slap however unconventional 
and unconscious it had been. I could clearly see how much those two 
fit together, opposites that matched perfectly without antagonizing. 
Minako had never really gotten angry or out of hand with Hotaru while 
this was by far not the first argument she and I had in the last 
month. And Hotaru always seemed to know just how to calm our mutual 
love interest down and make her see reason.
	I more and more felt that despite what Hotaru said - and I was 
not so shallow to believe that her words and promises were false - I 
wouldn&#39;t find a place in between them. Hotaru and I were a temporary 
thing and I wasn&#39;t sure if it was such a good idea to intrude on them 
when the Firefly finally succeed in bringing Minako around. That she 
would succeed, that was almost beyond doubt...
	The other thing was that I was worried sick about Hotaru which 
had only helped in further frying my nerves. For once Hotaru was 
already pretty distraught after learning about Minako&#39;s latest 
stupidity but what even further worried me was the signs I had picked 
up during the battle. Hotaru... no, Saturn had been very cautious with 
the creature, much more so than was usual. I mean, we had faced down 
entities that were in fact far stronger than this - admittedly 
considerable tough monster - but Saturn had always been the cool one, 
barely ever letting an emotion slip in the face of abnormal, mighty 
and overwhelming evil. But what I saw was coming so close to actual 
fear I could almost believe that had really been the case.
	And I doubted it was simply the creature. The creature - a 
Seeker she had called it - had worried her, that was for sure. But 
there was something far greater going on, something about the entire 
situation seemed to have fallen into place for her through the 
combined factors of the monster&#39;s appearance and the arrival of the 
redheaded mage - or whatever she was - who obviously seemed to know 
Saturn from somewhere. I had heard that name she used before, from 
Hotaru. I knew it was Saturn&#39;s birth name, the original one. The one 
from the era when she and the first reincarnation of Venus were...
	&#39;All we know is that something ancient is coming.&#39; I couldn&#39;t 
help but think back on Michiru&#39;s statement from the birthday party 
when I had briefly spoken with her and Haruka about the shifts in the 
winds and nature at a whole that were bothering me. For some reason I 
couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that Hotaru had somehow suspected 
something, some minor details coming together to form a greater 
picture that neither of us - save Pluto maybe - could comprehend. And 
it scared her. It scared Sailorsaturn, the Senshi of Silence, the one 
who could destroy and revolutionize entire star systems with three 
words and a stroke of her glaive. If that wasn&#39;t something to truly 
worry about when I didn&#39;t know what was.
	I hadn&#39;t realized I stopped in my motions until I felt a 
tentative hand on my shoulder. As I turned I came face to face with a 
set of purple eyes that both relieved me but in the same instant 
created a new level of anxiety seeing that the level of subtle concern 
had actually increased there. Those eyes looked much older, even for 
the usual ancient quality I came to expect from Saturn&#39;s gaze. These 
eyes didn&#39;t look only old as in ancient but more like old as in lost 
in memories, troubling memories, and with a certain note of tiredness 
in them. It was plainly apparent that the talk with her friend - 
assuming they were - hadn&#39;t gone as expected. Well, maybe as expected 
but definitely not as hoped for.
	&quot;What are you doing here all alone?&quot; Hotaru asked quietly, her 
eyes boring into mine, tearing apart every excuse I might have used. 
The concern for whatever information she had acquired was briefly 
covered by an intense expression that as much said as that she knew 
exactly something had happened between Minako and me. Hotaru knew well 
enough that nothing short of serious frustration would bring me here.
	Surprising myself I acted instead of saying anything first. A 
desperate anxiety had built up in me ever since I had watched my lover 
leave, following the stranger, and the exercise hadn&#39;t calmed me 
enough to bring peace to the whirlwind of emotions inside of me. 
Grabbing her by the waist, I pulled the startled dark-haired girl 
against my body in a kiss fueled by all my worries, anxiety and 
frustration, deciding that I had to work all that out of my system 
first before I said some things that I would only further regret 
later.
	It would be much later before I finally got to talk about the 
argument or haggle some information out of Hotaru myself.

******************************

(Hotaru)
It was late the following evening that I decided to take more direct 
action in this situation that had quickly grown over our heads. Makoto 
was out training. I had had to almost literally squeeze the details of 
her argument with Minako out of her after several hours of intense 
lovemaking. I had virtually no idea where my brunette lover took the 
energy from after the events of the day AND training for who knows how 
long until I found her in the spare room that had been offered to her 
for those purposes.
	I knew immediately then that something had to really have 
bothered her, beyond all that what I knew must have been already on 
her mind. My own departure surely hadn&#39;t helped things but seeing the 
need for release in the emerald eyes that moment I did neither resists 
nor was I one to complain about what followed. Mako-chan had been much 
calmer afterwards but still reluctant to part with the events that 
followed after we parted company. She seemed more embarrassed and 
guilty by the whole thing than truly annoyed or angry. Yet, I could 
see that some of the things exchanged did hurt her. And despite being 
moved by Makoto&#39;s protective attitude towards my feelings which had 
sparked the irrational bout of fury for Minako, I realized that the 
situation had come to a state where something more drastic had to be 
done.
	The conversation with and the revelations made by Sakura, Lina&#39;s 
reincarnation, had left their mark, unsettling me deeply to a point 
where I was even contemplating pushing the issue of the relationship 
between the three of us. Under any normal AND abnormal circumstances I 
would never force myself on someone, least the one person I had loved 
so long ago and whose absence had left a deep void in my soul that 
only recently had been filled by Makoto&#39;s tentative compassion. But 
the news of this unthinkable horror once again being released upon the 
unsuspecting world resulted in a quiet yet rock-firm resolve that this 
drama could not continue the way it had. There had to be a way to make 
Minako see just exactly what we felt and to push through those 
barriers she had put up against any kind of real, emotional love. The 
subtle hints were there. The blonde had made it clear so far that she 
didn&#39;t despise the night that had been the catalyst of the current 
events and a distant hope had settled in my heart that maybe over time 
she could come to accept this weird-seeming arrangement and come to 
love us as much as we did love her.
	But she was hiding her feelings, denying herself from giving 
into them more than just through the barest hint, the slightest motion 
that I doubted even Makoto had picked up. Minako was so much like 
Peitho though that they shared a lot of things in common that made it 
easy for me to interpret the tiny nuances of her nature without much 
trouble. It had been so similar at times that I couldn&#39;t help but 
wonder if for some weird twist Minako really was a perfect incarnation 
of the Venus I had known and loved for a lifetime and long beyond that 
in my heart. Truly matching souls. As rare as they were.
	Sakura had all but confirmed that theory through the spirit of 
the remodeled card that had once held Peitho&#39;s energy as a part of the 
ancient seal. And since I didn&#39;t believe much in coincidence, 
especially not so many at once, the truth was pretty much a fact. The 
truth that Minako really was my long lost soul mate. That realization 
had for a long time left me dumbstruck and unsure what to do with that 
knowledge. It wasn&#39;t like that changed everything. Minako was pretty 
much unaware of that life - perfect matching soul or not. Maybe she 
had had some memory flashes lately as Sakura hinted at which would 
explain some of her behavior in the past that I previously had been at 
a loss to explain. I couldn&#39;t expect her to love me just because of 
that. Usagi and Mamoru didn&#39;t love each other just because they had in 
a past life and were destined to be together. From what the others 
told me, they had fallen in love even before knowing about their fate 
and reincarnations.
	Just thinking about Pandora and how helpless the situation 
seemed to be, judging that if the seal was already weakened there was 
little to be done against a possible release. It might only be a 
matter of time. I shuddered at the thought. Sakura said they were 
looking for Sylphiel&#39;s reincarnation but it seemed like her presence 
was hidden from them and that alone only fueled the trepidation that 
this unholy monster was already a step ahead of them. And should even 
one of the seal children fall, it was bound to turn into a downward 
spiral of chain reactions that would be impossible to stop anymore. 
THEN it would come to another confrontation. And the way we were right 
now, none of us was truly ready for a challenge the size that made 
Galaxia look like a grasshopper compared to a giant.
	Firming my resolve by calling back to mind all those factors I 
prepared to exit the apartment and make my way over to the manor when 
I practically ran into Minako on the doorstep. Looks of mutual 
surprise crossed our faces at the realization that for some reason we 
had had pretty much the same idea if probably for different reasons. 
Minako looked really uncomfortable and I could tell that the fight 
with Makoto was probably - no, make that most definitely - on her 
mind.
	At the reminder of that event I finally managed to break the 
uncomfortable silence, schooling my features into an unreadable mask. 
&quot;Come in.&quot;
	Minako complied hesitantly as I stepped aside and slipped back 
out of the coat. The other woman did the same and then followed me 
back into the main living area of the tiny apartment in silence. She 
stood uncertainly before I motioned her to sit with which she complied 
as well. I could see the emotions warring in her face, the battle 
between either putting up a fight or just relenting. This would be 
harder than even I imagined... or so I thought until Minako&#39;s opening 
question that cut through the heavy air like a knife through butter, 
making me revaluate my opinion. It was going to be MUCH harder than I 
originally believed.
	&quot;Who is Peitho?&quot;
	I didn&#39;t answer for a long while, contemplating my answers 
before settling for the blunt truth. My intention for tonight remained 
the same and maybe it was even better in some way that Minako came 
here and not the other way round. &quot;Peitho was the first Venus that was 
ever born to this star system. She was also Lady Phoebe&#39;s, the 
original Saturn&#39;s, hence my, soul mate until we were separated through 
the events of a long and brutal war that cost many sacrifices on all 
of our parts.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but let the bitterness that rose up 
within in me slip past the usually emotionless mask of Saturn. That 
was something even Saturn couldn&#39;t hide from or fake indifference 
towards. It was impossible to deny the pent-up feelings of loneliness 
and frustration that had gathered in the course of two hundred 
millennia in which I had not set eyes on the one person that had ever 
truly completed me.
	And Minako obviously picked up on those emotions if the insuring 
silence was any indication. &quot;So that is why you love me then.&quot; The 
words were spoken softly and if not for Senshi hearing I doubt I would 
have heard then. A wave of new emotions flooded through me and I 
couldn&#39;t suppress the laugh, that was hard and lacked any kind of 
amusement.
	&quot;Do you really think me that shallow?&quot;
	Minako flinched, turning her head away and unwilling to meet my 
intense gaze. I became annoyed with the continuing avoidance of direct 
eye contact and stepped around the table and in front of the blonde 
girl to confront her.
	Blue eyes hesitantly turned up to look at me and blinked in 
obvious shock. I had dropped any and all pretense of hiding the true 
depth of the feelings inside of me. Feelings both bottled up from my 
life as Peitho as well as Hotaru&#39;s and I think she got the distinction 
and the true deepness of those emotions.
	And I saw something there that I had not been sure yet whether I 
was imagining or just grasping onto straws in the hope of a revival of 
what was lost to me lifetimes ago. Hidden, carefully protected more 
than a fortress guarding all the treasures of one world. And I slowly 
began to understand. I began to understand just what had to be done 
and in that moment my mind was finally set on that one path that might 
bring a change for the better in this situation.

******************************

(Minako)
Losing yourself in the depths of someone else&#39;s eyes, completely swept 
away in a flood of emotions, leaving you breathless and submerged in 
strange sensation that wrecked your body. I hadn&#39;t experienced that 
look since... since... Had I ever? I thought with more than a touch of 
remorse. Had I ever truly experienced this kind of affection, this 
kind of LOVE that I was seeing there in the dark-haired girl&#39;s eyes? 
Well, maybe I did, on that night that none of us clearly remember. But 
other than that, I admitted to myself in a moment of unguarded 
honesty, this had never happened to me before... A very sad thought 
indeed.
	The effort was considerable but somehow I managed to tear my 
gaze away from the younger - yet in many ways so much older - girl&#39;s. 
I hadn&#39;t actually planned this the way it started. I had actually come 
to apologize for my behavior and talk about this rationally. The talk 
with Artemis had left me shaken, unprotected. I couldn&#39;t hide from 
him. As much as I tried, I couldn&#39;t. It was an impossibility, a 
paradox that could not be. And he had known it very well.
	&quot;So you deny that you love me because there&#39;s a special 
attraction between those like us? Because it is easier?&quot; I had 
intended to throw Hotaru off for a moment, in order to rebuild my 
deeply fractured composure. Artemis had told me that it was not 
uncommon, that it was indeed EASIER for those who had bright star 
seeds, pure souls. They attracted each other on a basic level. That 
did not necessarily mean this was limited to Senshi alone. Endymion 
was a good example that not every person with a pure star seed was to 
be a Senshi. Artemis said there were many kinds of pure souls and not 
all of them were even Sailor Crystals.
	I was surprised that Hotaru didn&#39;t seem to be affected at all by 
the accusation. There was a potent calmness that unsettled me 
somewhat. &quot;No. Minako, love is never EASY. Attraction is easy, yes. 
You can get attracted to many different sorts of people and still you 
would never come to love any of them. To truly, unconditional love 
someone it needs more than basic attraction.&quot; She turned and stepped 
over to the window and I wasn&#39;t sure whether or not to be relieved of 
being not submitted to that penetrating gaze again. A part of me 
actually cried out in apparent loss and it was growing harder to shut 
this part out.
	&quot;So, you are suddenly the great big expert on love. Tell me, 
Hotaru-chan, what do you feel for Makoto?&quot;
	There was a pause in which I stood up and joined her next to the 
window. Then Hotaru spoke she once again surprised me with the resolve 
in her voice. &quot;I love her... or at least I&#39;m almost at the point where 
I could say that. I know what you are trying to say and yes, our 
relationship started out mostly from loneliness and compassion. But 
I&#39;ve come to really love her.&quot;
	&quot;And you love me at the same time or is that just Phoebe loving 
Peitho?&quot; I knew I had worded that pitifully in my outburst yesterday. 
I had not meant to belittle their feelings but I couldn&#39;t help but 
truly grasp this strange mix of feelings the two girls displayed 
towards me and at the same time each other.
	&quot;Both actually. Minako, I AM Phoebe.&quot; I opened my mouth to 
question about that, the seriousness and unshaken belief behind the 
statement shocking me. &quot;And why is it so hard to accept that I could 
fall in love with someone else at the same time? But this isn&#39;t really 
what you want to know and what is the problem here.&quot;
	I sighed and licked my lips in anticipation, knowing that I 
couldn&#39;t hold that back any longer. I hadn&#39;t even told Artemis about 
the dreams that had become so much more vivid lately but the events of 
the day and Hotaru&#39;s admission demanded an answer, and that answer was 
demanded now. &quot;Okay. You ARE Phoebe,&quot; I conceded for the moment, &quot;As 
much as I am Peitho?&quot;
	Hotaru turned towards me and I did likewise, trying to match her 
stoic resolve with my own, not backing down or relenting as I found 
myself doing so often in the presence of the younger girl. &quot;Does it 
matter? Does it REALLY matter?&quot; Hotaru whispered and I became very 
aware of the charged air around us. The tension that had built up 
throughout the conversation - that on the outside actually appeared to 
be calm and rational - had almost reached the climax and I dreaded the 
inevitable eruption.
	&quot;Yes, it does matter!&quot; I shouted, becoming slightly more furious 
when Hotaru&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change as she stood calmly, letting me 
once again fall into the rhythm I was as much familiar with as I 
despised it. &quot;It matters because I can&#39;t stand this anymore. I don&#39;t 
know what the heck is wrong with me or why I am acting like a complete 
idiot whenever we come to this point. I tried, Hotaru-chan, I tried so 
hard to accept all this. My fate, this destiny we&#39;ve been placed 
inside, beyond our control. And you know what, I loved it, I still do. 
When Artemis came and revealed to me who I really was, my life 
suddenly had purpose. Nothing had really challenged me up to then. And 
then, just like that, there was suddenly a mission for me, something 
that I could devote my whole attention upon.&quot;
	&quot;And you deny yourself REALLY loving somebody because you think 
it would interfere with your duties. You think you can&#39;t be our leader 
and protect the Princess anymore when you let yourself fall in love.&quot; 
I was so shocked at the casual revelation of the silent, untold truth 
that was kept in my heart that I stood speechless for several seconds 
at Hotaru. Not able to even begin to grasp how she had figured that 
one out. I hadn&#39;t even meant to say so much in the first place. The 
words had just come spilling out in a wave of anger at the situation, 
the endless whims of fates and maybe at myself as well. &quot;I think 
Makoto was right. You do make a pathetic leader if you continue 
denying your very nature.&quot;
	That managed to snap me out of my stupor and I surrendered once 
again to the burst of heated emotions hidden inside for so long. &quot;How 
can I? How can I remain in control when I let myself fall in love with 
someone? I would devote my attention on that person and forget about 
my duty, I would make the decision in their favor should there ever be 
one to make and I... I...&quot;
	The desperate grasp for words to explain all those tangled 
emotions inside of me was brought to an abrupt halt with the force of 
a sledgehammer. I was subconsciously impressed by the strength in the 
younger girl but was too busy with Hotaru&#39;s sudden action of fusing 
her lips on mine to think about it. I was caught off guard and unable 
to react at all under the shower of deep, penetrating, lingering 
kisses, full of hunger, desire and a loneliness that had long needed 
to be satisfied. The onslaught was so furious my body was left to 
respond on autopilot as my mind was swept away in a swirl of emotions 
too strong and too irrational to comprehend by normal thought 
processes. My arms and hands had a mind of their own as they went 
around the smaller form, seeking some form of hold under the 
unrelenting kisses. And where at any other given time I would have 
struggled, would have pushed Hotaru away, now I simply drew her 
closer, moving backwards with her advance of passionate aggression 
that washed away every defense I could ever have put up.
	I didn&#39;t even know how we ended up in the bedroom. I only 
noticed that fact, briefly emerging from that otherworldly place I had 
been carried away to when my feet hit the edges of the bed. Hotaru 
pulled away a few centimeters and her voice was husky and laced with 
clear lust and longing that didn&#39;t need to be spelled out to convey 
their meaning. &quot;Just let go,&quot; was all that she said before moving in 
for another kiss that contained the same force as the previous ones 
and managed to tumble us completely over so that we would eventually 
end up on the bed.
	I belatedly wondered if I came here to provoke this. To provoke 
any excuse of letting go of that tight control I had put my life under 
ever since becoming a Senshi. Acting had helped to give me those 
moments, helped to provide me with the possibility to completely lose 
myself in something. That was okay. Those moments were just for the 
stage. They couldn&#39;t end up hurting anyone I cared about or... hurting 
myself.
	Those were about the last coherent thoughts before my mind shut 
down and I let myself fall, for once not caring about consequences, 
about what was tomorrow, about what might happen after this night. 
Hotaru made it impossible to do otherwise and maybe that truly was 
what I had wanted all along. I couldn&#39;t do that for myself, I couldn&#39;t 
let go all under my own power, I couldn&#39;t seek the fulfillment the 
lonely girl inside of me craved like a hungry beast. For now, I could 
just leave myself in the moment and enjoy it for what it truly was. 
And that part of me that had been neglected so long sighed in 
tremendous relief and at the same time cried out in relief, devoured 
the loving passion sent her way with an equal hunger, resulting in a 
manner of sexual interaction that would have been hard for many to 
believe and hard for many to even duplicate. Not even speaking about 
the surviving part. It was Senshi mating in its purest kind. How I 
knew, I couldn&#39;t tell, I just knew, and that was enough for me at that 
moment, my rational mind having taken a blissful, long needed 
vacation.

******************************

(Makoto)
Returning home late from training I was pretty sure I had worked out 
even the last bit of anger and frustration from yesterday&#39;s events. 
Saotome-sensei hadn&#39;t complained about my unscheduled appearance. If 
one thing he seemed to know exactly what went through me at such times 
and tended to come up with just the right kind of exercise that could 
let me burn out that excess energy, emerging clean and with my 
perspective put back into proper perspective.
	That state remained to be that way for all but two minutes. That 
is the time it took me from letting myself in and into the bedroom. 
There was no indicator that really prepared me for the sight that 
awaited me when I planned to silently check on my lover who obviously 
had gone to sleep early. That happened sometimes and considering that 
today was Sunday and tomorrow there would be school again, I wasn&#39;t 
all too surprise about the lack of a greeting. I might have suspected 
something had I paid attention to the extra coat or the not all that 
unusual state of disarray parts of the living room - especially those 
that lead up to the bedroom - were in. But I was kind of tired myself 
and so didn&#39;t pay that extra bit attention, thus sending me in a state 
of dumbstruck stupor upon seeing the two forms on the double bed - 
which we had kind of moved together after moving our relationship up a 
notch -, comfortably snuggled under the covers. The taller blonde had 
her head resting on my lover&#39;s chest, heaving quiet and content 
breaths that spoke of rather recent activity - and a pretty heavy one 
at that.
	I felt a brief spark of jealousy, a flame of anger rising from 
the already extinguished and swept away ashes as conscious thought was 
overridden by snap judgment and the most logical thing that someone 
was supposed to think when they found their lover with another in bed 
upon returning home.
	However, we were all but normal. Our relationship was anything 
but logical at most times. We began a tentative affair because we 
couldn&#39;t have the one woman that we both wanted and loved, came to 
love each other on a level and found in the process that we had gotten 
the same woman pregnant in the course of some crazy-sounding drunken 
night of loosened inhabitations, aided by a magical device that 
originally wasn&#39;t even intended for that purpose. No, normal was not 
the word that you could describe our relationship with.
	So, I pushed away the initial emotion all but tearing it apart 
with firm resolve. If it had been anyone but the blonde woman, my 
fellow teammate and leader, they wouldn&#39;t have even survived until 
this point. That much was for sure. But that was Minako. And judged by 
the strange chain reaction of events lately the shock was quickly 
overridden by a barely rational sense of relief.
	I felt one... no, two sets of eyes resting on me and stared back 
silently, intently searching blue and purple eyes for something that 
would speak against the opinion I had come to in the space of the few 
moments I stood there. Finally I crossed my arms and pretended to be 
more than just a little angry and hurt. &quot;Well, you two obviously had 
fun without me. Maybe I should go back from where I came and stay the 
night there.&quot;
	Hotaru didn&#39;t even bat an eyebrow, catching onto the pretense 
and the appreciative glimmer I let show in my eyes for whatever she 
had done to bring Minako into bed, more or less willing, quite sated 
and content with herself. &quot;Are you going to stand there all night? We 
have been missing someone here and you let us waiting long enough.&quot;
	Minako lifted her head and I almost stumbled under the seductive 
leer unlike the in-control woman she had been for so many years now. 
There was a playful twinkle in her eye, a sure sign that whatever 
walls she had put up around herself were apparently torn down and 
taking a long vacation for the moment. &quot;Not that I would like to have 
your girlfriend all for myself for a bit longer.&quot;
	I huffed, quickly covering the surprise upon seeing Minako so 
unguarded and not withholding her emotions. &quot;You&#39;d like that, wouldn&#39;t 
you?&quot; I reached behind me and closed the door, basking the room once 
more in the night&#39;s shadows that were still bright enough for a 
Senshi&#39;s vision. Even before the door fell into place I had begun to 
discard my clearly unnecessary clothes.

	It was a long time later before physical exhaustion claimed its 
victims and I found myself silently appraising Minako&#39;s stamina 
considering her condition. The child in her was growing rapidly, much 
faster than during a normal pregnancy. Technically she was now almost 
four months along but it was definitely close to six actually. 
Interesting enough outwardly Minako appeared more like she was in the 
beginning of her second month. The expected bulge of the belly was 
absent for the most part. There was some explanation for that but I 
usually tended to blank out whenever Ami went into a scientific - or 
whatever you wanted to call it in this case - explanation. Hotaru 
seemed to understand and that was enough for me. And at the moment I 
felt too comfortable in the blissful state of afterglow. The tension 
and abstruse situation created between us over the last month had come 
to an explosive release this evening. At a point and time I had really 
not expected, nor had I been prepared for this possibility upon 
returning home.
	&#39;Insignificant details&#39;, I mused from my position behind Minako, 
arms wrapped firmly around the blonde while one hand had come to rest 
on Hotaru&#39;s arm. My lover lay on the other side of the young woman who 
right now was visibly fighting to retrieve her bearings, not too 
mention her breath. Not that either of us was fairing any better.
	&quot;That was...&quot; Hotaru started, the first coherent words spoken 
for a long time.
	&quot;Definitely better than not remembering any of it?&quot; I supplied 
with a small grin tugging on my lips and an inquiring look into the 
presently closed blue eyes of Minako. Those eyes fluttered open and 
blinked against the deep stare for a moment before a sigh escaped her 
lips that was very hard to really define. It could have been happiness 
and contentment but it could also have been regret or doubt or... 
well, a lot of things. Given how much of an emotional roller coaster 
all of us and especially Minako had been put through of late, that was 
hardly surprising. &quot;I must agree.&quot; Minako managed a grin that faded 
into a solemn look almost immediately. &quot;That was... incredible, but I 
can&#39;t...&quot;
	Hotaru seemed to instinctively know what was coming and moved 
slightly to hush our pregnant lover. &quot;Shh, you don&#39;t have to say it. 
No conditions here.&quot; It took my still detached mind a moment to catch 
up on the meaning and slowly I managed to come to acknowledge that I 
had obviously come to the correct conclusion during my training 
session. And obviously Hotaru had as well, somehow managing to act on 
that knowledge. Once again I felt a spark of insecurity and envy, 
wondering once again if I would truly have a place in their midst in 
the near and distant future, but I shushed it away, not wanting to 
disturb my mood.
	Tightening my arms around Minako, I moved my head a little 
closer to hers and added, &quot;We&#39;ll be here for you, waiting. As long as 
you need us to.&quot; Subtly tensed muscles relaxed almost immediately and 
another sigh, this time of clearly evident relief, echoed through the 
darkness.
	We stayed that way for a long while each of us was feeling too 
good to break the silence and the cocoon of love and fulfillment that 
had enveloped us in a motherly embrace. For once in those hectic last 
months we had achieved a phase of peace and true harmony. This was far 
from over. Minako had let herself accept a part of what we were 
offering but she wasn&#39;t yet ready to share all of her feelings yet. 
That was okay though. Tonight had been one victory in the course of 
eventually winning the war. Who won that war in the end and with what 
exact outcome remained to be seen. For now, all those questions were 
hovering outside that protective sphere of momentary peace that would 
hopefully help us through what still lay ahead of us.

&lt;February 20 (Tomoyo)&gt;
Neo Infinity was a bustle of activity. Not surprisingly, considering 
it was the end of the semester. Mind you, this was the first year 
since the school&#39;s completion - or better rebuilding - and compared to 
the vast size of the tower that, similar to the original one, reached 
up to the thousandth level, the number of students was tiny. Still, 
Neo Infinity had despite the fate the old one suffered found a very 
HIGH number of willing, young people who wanted to apply. The fact 
that Tokyo was in fact THE magical nexus on Earth was more or less 
proven by the concentration of talented young minds with various most 
amazing gifts.
	I had jumped at the chance when we heard of the rebuilding and 
Sakura had expressed an interest. Often enough I was left feeling so 
entirely meek and insignificant to my mate&#39;s role and superior 
knowledge. Nowadays, with the added memories, she could pull of feats 
even many students in this very school would find hard to believe. 
Sure, I was supposed to be some top-notch mage in my past incarnation 
as well and hey, I wasn&#39;t one to question or doubt that, not with the 
memories I had already unlocked. No, that&#39;s not it. I had pretty much 
gotten used to that change in our life. Even the little detail that I 
had been a QUEEN in my former life which threw me for a loop when I 
really let myself think about it. No, from that end I had no need to 
feel meek compared to Sakura. It was just that she did all the 
important things. I wasn&#39;t jealous or envious of that. But I always 
had wondered if there was some BIGGER way that I could really make a 
difference. The feeling wasn&#39;t consuming since Sakura made sure I did 
know my infinite worth. We both knew our places in our relationship by 
now but yet we never settled into a routine, never lost that special 
touch that would make us do practically everything for the other&#39;s 
continued happiness.
	And so, when Meiou Setsuna, adoptive mother of the daughter of 
the former owner, had searched for benefactors and sponsors I had not 
hesitated to, for once, take the initiative. Okaasan wasn&#39;t even 
really surprised when I made the request. I had inherited my own share 
of Daidouji industries and no doubt she had hoped for me to at some 
point take over the business. However, our lives - Sakura and mine 
that is - had changed so drastically that Okaasan didn&#39;t even put up 
much of a protest when I request to use my share as a sponsor. She was 
quite adamant about helping out herself but I managed to talk her 
down. Maybe it was purely selfish, yet for once I wanted to be. This 
was MY contribution to OUR life together. And I could not help but 
feeling satisfied at seeing how very well the school in roughly one 
year had turned out.
	Since the sponsored money had pretty much covered and supported 
half of the project I was now pretty much a co-partner in this. A role 
I never was really pushing. Meiou-san was a good principal/owner and 
far more experienced than I could hope to be. And the fact remained 
that I still was attending my last year of High School as well... in 
my own school! Hey, how&#39;s that for a weird setting? So, the junior 
partner part was kept pretty much in the dark and remained a silent 
agreement between the older woman and me. As far as the public knew I 
was the &quot;anonymous benefactor from Daidouji Industries&quot;.
	I think pretty much eighty percent of the student body knew 
anyway...
	Spotting my query in the entry hall, I pushed my way through the 
crowd. It was ironic that we never really realized how close we were 
to each other. Granted, my memories were still fragmental, I didn&#39;t 
really act as the technical co-owner for the appropriate reasons and 
Sakura was busy with her own classes and hadn&#39;t had found that much 
time to take a look at the administrative staff or something like 
that... So, okay, maybe we had just missed each other for pretty much 
a year. As dumb as that sounded considering that I DID remember some 
things of Phoebe rather early on and we were practically as close to 
OWNING the school when any of the other students could say. I WAS the 
(semi-)anonymous junior partner and Tomoe Hotaru was the daughter of 
the previous owner as well as the surrogate one of the current one.
	&quot;Hey,&quot; Hotaru greeted upon spotting me. &quot;Sorry about not showing 
up yesterday. I... um... kind of overslept and well...&quot; Was she 
flustered? I took a closer look and had to suppress a teasing smile. 
She was. Obviously whatever had held her up had to be more than just 
oversleeping.
	&quot;I take it you have been reconciling with Peitho-chan then.&quot; Not 
a question, more a statement. And judged by the brief flush on the 
other girl&#39;s face an appropriate one. &quot;I am glad. You said there were 
some... difficulties... and well, from what I remember you used to be 
such a sweet couple that it would be a real shame to not revive it.&quot;
	Hotaru&#39;s expression turned somewhat somber and her eyes were 
momentarily downcast. &quot;Let us just say we... found a temporary 
agreement. Minako is... difficult. She&#39;s a lot like her, yes. And even 
if what you told me is true, there is still a difference. The merging 
between me and Hotaru was far more easier than for the others. While I 
entered the rebirth cycle myself I never really DIED, you understand?&quot;
	For a moment I let the words settled into my mind, processing 
them and comparing the message to our own situation before nodding 
slowly. &quot;Yes, I believe I do. I probably can only really do when I 
fully obtain all my memories but if it is anything remotely close to 
what your friends and teammates had to go through, I think I do 
understand. Sakura told me that she would and could never really be 
Lina again. She has the memories and can choose to draw and act on 
them but that&#39;s all there is, a sort of pseudo presence created by the 
knowledge and experience of a different lifetimes.&quot; A couple of years 
ago I would have probably only understood half of that but now, being 
in more or less the same situation and with far more training tied 
into it, I could speak of those matters with a much firmer confidence 
in not making a fool out of myself.
	&quot;For Minako and the others it is pretty much like that. But I - 
and Pluto - we are still the same person. My case is a little special 
since I am also Tomoe Hotaru.&quot;
	&quot;Oh,&quot; was all I could reply to that and the bell signaling the 
near start of classes interrupted any further comments I could have 
come up with. &quot;Look,&quot; I said in order to get my original intent across 
before we had to part company, &quot;There probably are a lot more 
questions both you and Sakura have. She wanted to meet you some time 
during lunch. Is that okay for you?&quot; With a slight twinkle in my eyes, 
I added, &quot;Or do you have other plans?&quot;
	Hotaru shook her head, with a calm and collected seriousness I 
remembered well belonging to her Senshi aspect, recalling it from my 
memories of Phoebe. &quot;No, that is fine with me.&quot;

******************************

&lt;February 28 (Sakura)&gt;
The classrooms of Neo Infinity were not as you would expect them of 
such a modern-looking building. In fact there were enough examples 
where you wondered if you had just stepped through a time portal. Neo 
Infinity was taking great care by creating the right atmosphere for 
the various fields. The right biological environments for 
para-cultural studies, sterile and save rooms for science and other 
such studies, the right setting of medieval, traditional or modern for 
the various fields of magic... A lot of those were very magnificent 
displays of harnessing dimensional magic. Sure, most of them were just 
very complex illusions but it was still impressive.
	I had done my fair share in the magic wing, the cards had 
literally jumped at the chance of being creative. I couldn&#39;t help but 
smile fondly at the memory. Things had changed so much over the last 
years, ever since the incident with the Seal Cards. I had devoted a 
lot of time of readjusting my body to the old arcane magic by 
reflecting on the old memories. Then there was Tomoyo who needed 
teaching which only further rooted us in that cycle. And, of course, 
the major reason. Sylphiel. It was frustrating. Years spent without 
having found a trail. Her presence was close by now, that much I could 
tell, but somehow I couldn&#39;t put my finger - figuratively as well as 
magical - on it. And knowing Pandora I dreaded to think about what 
could happen to the rebirth of the gentle shrine maiden that had been 
so close to both Amelia and myself. I believe Tomoyo is worried too, 
even though she tried to not show it for my sake. However, my mate had 
accepted that part of our shared destiny with surprising ease, no 
doubt courtesy of her own memories, and was indulging in the search as 
much as I did, sharing my concerns quietly.
	All that had somehow made me neglect a lot of things lately. 
Kero for example who had always been a great help and advisor but 
whose knowledge paled to the memories of Lina Inverse. I was glad that 
we had that family meeting last weekend with everyone present. It was 
a time of recuperation, recuperation from the burden that was weighing 
on both Tomoyo and myself now. The burden of knowing that a battle 
would begin shortly that we only had an elusive grasp on, with only 
the faintest glimmer of hope that it could be prevented. There were 
times I deeply regretted having pulled Tomoyo into this but 
remembering just how insistent and supportive my lover was on the 
subject and the ties of fate between us, I knew that without her, I 
would have given up a long time ago. I definitely couldn&#39;t have faced 
all this again, not without her. Once had been enough already and now, 
for her sake, I would do everything to ensure that a repeat of those 
events would not come to transpire.
	Coming out of my momentary reflection I realized that the period 
was almost over and I would definitely look foolish being caught 
dozing off while lecturing... Well, okay, the other students were 
reading a paper I had handed out and thus that had given me time to 
think a little. The semester was almost finished and most tests were 
done already. Compared to the normal studies, the paranormal wing was 
not so much grade-orientated as it was success-orientated. The goal 
was to teach the students to understand their individual skills or the 
topics they were researching better, to ensure complete knowledge of 
not only fact but also comprehension of what was learned. This was 
part of the strict selection process of Neo Infinity. Not everyone was 
taken who had some form of skill or dormant talent. The principle was 
to raise students who would eventually help to make the world a better 
place and not abuse what they learned here. And there were no 
exceptions tolerated.
	This resulted in a very unique style of teaching. Actually the 
procedure was not so much of a single, advanced professor - or more 
accordingly mage etc. - to stand in the front and lecture. Classes 
here were often more a sharing platform, a community where skills and 
knowledge of various paranormal aspects were presented not only by 
official teachers but also by the respective students, especially 
those that already had a rudimentary or higher understanding of their 
abilities. Students of all different ages and grades at that. Those 
classes that made up the other half of Neo Infinity&#39;s schedule were 
universal, spanning all grades and only dividing in levels of maturity 
in the student&#39;s talents.
	&quot;I think that is enough for today. Read those papers at home and 
we finish this session next week,&quot; I dismissed the class. You would be 
surprised actually. The atmosphere was much more relaxed than in a 
normal school and that in turn also produced a higher level of 
concentration and participation. Practically all those that were here 
WANTED to be here, really wanted to. And that helped enormously. There 
was nobody who didn&#39;t want to learn and thus the study atmosphere was 
probably the most perfect any school had ever seen.
	And so it came, that you almost ever had a good handful of 
students lining up at the end asking various questions. I endured it 
all with somewhat satisfied patience. I never had seen myself much of 
a teacher. Sure, I had thought about it when I was younger - the first 
time around -, seeing as Otousan was a professor on a university 
himself. There was a difference about thinking about it and actually 
standing in front of an entire classroom - not mention as a senior in 
High School yourself... Lina&#39;s memories hadn&#39;t helped there much 
either. Although she had helped training Amelia in some more advanced 
fields later on and possessed a vast mystical knowledge, there had 
been several reasons why she chose to become a traveling mage instead 
of studying and eventually teaching at the guilds.
	About a couple of minutes later I was done with the questions 
and had just about finished packing my own things. This was my last 
class today and I was eager to meet up with Tomoyo, our paths not 
having crossed today as often as usual. I didn&#39;t even see the figure 
approach at first and the hesitant voice was so soft and low I almost 
didn&#39;t hear it at first.
	&quot;Excuse me?&quot; As I glanced up halfway, finishing in zipping my 
backpack, something pressed against the core of my awareness, 
something distinctively familiar about the voice though I could have 
sworn it didn&#39;t belong to any of the normal students. That wasn&#39;t that 
suspicious since some lectures were open for the public. Okay, not for 
the public but for those who were interested in application or to give 
those selected an idea about the general way of things here. Yet, 
there was something so hauntingly familiar about the voice that I 
finally gave the girl in front of the desk my full attention.
	I almost fell over in complete, utter shock.
	Purple hair, long and unbound. Green eyes reflecting a 
gentleness and quiet strength - but also something... darker, I 
distantly noted. The garb - as was traditional for Neo Infinity coming 
to class in the appropriate clothes - that of a miko. The physical 
attributes matched pretty much perfectly. Perfectly. It was like the 
analogy I had pondered at the beginning about stepping right out of a 
time portal.
	I knew beyond a doubt, with a crushing certainty - not to 
mention a good dose of disbelief at the absurdity - that it was HER.
	&quot;Ano, are you okay, Sensei?&quot; the girl asked, snapping me out of 
my perplexed trance. &quot;I just wanted to say that I enjoyed class today 
and look forward to studying here next semester.&quot;
	My lips moved more on autopilot, my mind too busy trying to wrap 
itself around the impossible coincidence. Almost four long years we 
had been searching and now, here, right before my nose she stood. 
There was no doubt about it. The spitting mirror image, the very 
incarnation of our lost mate, Sylphiel Nels Lahda.
	&quot;Ah yes. I was just, lost in thought. What was your name again?&quot; 
I asked, a part of me knowing fully well that as happy and grateful as 
I felt right now, this girl did not know about any of it and this 
matter had to be dealt with carefully. And there was NO way I was 
going to let this chance slip out of my hands again.
	&quot;Lisa. Lisa Whiteligher desu,&quot; the girl replied then a 
thoughtful expression crossed her face and it was apparent she was 
very worried for some reason. &#39;So much like her&#39;, the thought passed 
through my mind and I corrected myself right away. &#39;No, exactly like 
her. I can&#39;t believe this.&#39; I had expected changes, just like with 
Tomoyo and me. But this girl, Lisa, there was practically no 
superficial difference in appearance. &quot;Ano, I hope you don&#39;t take this 
the wrong way but... Do we know each other?&quot;
	I had a VERY hard time answering THAT one.

******************************

(Lisa)
Due to the events of the last year I had become somewhat bitter, 
showing this with a touch of cynicism. That was by far not my usual 
nature, mind you. However, circumstances of life had taught me to 
never take a statement or situation as it appeared to be. Maybe I was 
a wee bit too untrusting lately, yet I could smell that there was much 
more to this teacher I had spoken to than met the eye. Far more than 
Kinomoto Sakura had let on initially.
	Why else would she request private talks even before I was 
officially part of the student body? I didn&#39;t believe one second that 
she was merely &#39;interested&#39; in me and my ability. I didn&#39;t think she 
even put any attention to the ring or noticed the fact that unlike 
many of the other students attending, I was already beyond the mere 
theory of elemental beings. How I could be so sure? Well, maybe 
because her eyes were practically glued to me, as if seeing right to 
my very soul.
	Mind you, the striking resemblance to the girl in my eyes was a 
very strong indicator for far greater happenings as well. And I was 
pretty sure that neither was the meeting today a coincidence nor was 
this Sakura unaware of the... pull that must have went through both of 
us. She wasn&#39;t student head of the Magic department for nothing after 
all.
	She might as well hold the key to the answers I had been 
seeking.
	&quot;Dinner&#39;s ready in another ten minutes, Lisa-chan,&quot; Obabasan 
greeted as I passed by the kitchen. I sometimes really wondered how 
she managed to be practically everywhere at once, and that in her 
while by far not crippling but definitely considerable old age.
	&quot;I&#39;ll be down in a bit,&quot; I replied in passing and headed up the 
stairs, lost in thought about the meeting that had occurred at Neo 
Infinity. I had gone there, as they say it so nicely, on a whim, 
figuring I might as well take advantage of the courses that were 
offering guests to listen in. And while I had been distracted by the 
nagging sense of familiarity and the resemblance of the student that 
had lectured pretty much the entire period, I had been quite 
fascinated and interested in the lecture itself. Sure, having had a 
contract with an elemental spirit for quite some time now, I had made 
my own experiences and a lot of the theory was... irrelevant. There 
were, however, subtle things, nuances, side comments that I guessed 
went right past the average listener. Having been taught by my own 
elemental a lot of those aspects, I could appreciate the obvious depth 
of experience and knowledge Kinomoto Sakura possessed on the subject. 
To make a long praise short... I had never in my life been paying that 
much rapt attention to a lecture.
	And don&#39;t you dare tell that to anyone I know.
	&quot;What am I going to get for that?&quot; the clear, bell-like voice of 
Soyokaze vibrated in the air about a second before its owner decided 
to make an appearance.
	&quot;A week not being sealed inside that ring,&quot; I replied casually, 
shrugging out of my clothes to change into something more relaxed.
	&quot;By cosmic law something is bound to happen in that time that 
you need me with. Besides, what would you do without my insight?&quot; 
Soyo-chan quipped without breaking stride, snatching up the blouse 
with a gust of air that shouldn&#39;t have been possible in a closed room. 
I caught the article, noticing the very brief furrowing of tiny, 
ghost-like eyebrows. I was probably imagining it anyway but sometimes 
I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if the gentle Sylph had a crush on me. I 
did read that this tended to happen quite a lot in a traditional 
summoner-elemental relationship. Elemental spirits were by nature a 
lot more easygoing and bare of human social complications like 
inhibitions.
	&quot;Hai,&quot; I said, before standing up to move in front of the 
mirror, starting to fix my air. &quot;But I don&#39;t need to call you out to 
use your power or talk to you.&quot;
	There was a noticeable period of silence after that, the Sylph 
obviously trying to make a comeback. Lacking that, she resorted to the 
cute and clearly human reaction of pouting. &quot;Ah,&quot; I said, &quot;now, not 
that look again. That&#39;s dirty play.&quot;
	&quot;You are no fun,&quot; Soyo-chan replied with mock hurt, making a 
show of turning away with arms crossed. In truth I knew beyond doubt 
that the easy banter between us was a part of our partnership that she 
cherished just as much as I did.
	I chuckled merrily. &quot;I thought being snippily is a royal 
trademark for humans.&quot; My smile deepened at the indignant look, 
followed by a flush and the almost immediate reaction of trying to 
cover up the feinted shock. &quot;But seriously,&quot; I decided to change 
topics, my mood definitely more relaxed now. &quot;What do you make of 
her?&quot; I didn&#39;t need to ask whether or not Soyo-chan had listened. 
While a reserved, gentle kind, many Sylph&#39;s were remarkable curious, 
especially one as young as she was.
	&quot;All I can say for sure is that this girl&#39;s the real deal.&quot; I 
raised an eyebrow at that, waiting for further explanation. &quot;A 
full-fledged sorceress, I mean. There is indeed a high concentration 
of talent in that school but this one... She could really shape the 
world, literally. Especially on a nexus like Tokyo.&quot;
	I mulled that one over, finding my own analysis matching that of 
the wind elemental. Trained in the spiritual arts I could definitely 
feel the tingle of vibrant, colorful power around her. &quot;Maybe so. But 
she&#39;s hiding something from me,&quot; I confessed the center point of my 
irritancy, knowing that it wasn&#39;t likely that Soyo-chan hadn&#39;t figured 
it out by now.
	&quot;Do you really think she&#39;s outright lying to you?&quot; the Sylph 
inquired softly and I glanced over my shoulder at her with an 
inquisitive gaze. &quot;What I mean is: Did you expect her - assuming she 
has something to do with the mystery of your dreams - to come right 
out and tell you all about it. Probably some unbelievable, 
farfetched-sounding story of a past life you were supposed to have 
lived? That is what you are suspecting, isn&#39;t it? And you know I 
support you there.&quot;
	I winced at the wording, once more reminded just why I valued 
the Sylph&#39;s wisdom and insight practically above anyone else&#39;s. Wind 
was the aspect of the mind and my friend definitely was following that 
role. She was a very good advisor in most situations.
	&quot;Guess you are right. She has no idea that I&#39;m already 
suspecting, I am not sure what to think about it myself or how to 
approach her about it and besides that, maybe I&#39;m just seeing things 
and she doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the girl of my dreams.&quot; 
Noticing Soyo-chan&#39;s look I grinned ruefully, realizing just how that 
last part sounded. With a more somber voice I added after awhile, &quot;I 
don&#39;t even know if trying to solve that mystery is such a good idea. 
What if I&#39;m unlocking something... wrong?&quot; I trailed off, glancing 
over into the general direction of the dresser next to my bed.
	Soyo-chan noticed the look and replied softly, &quot;That&#39;s something 
you have to know for yourself. But since you started already, will you 
really turn back now?&quot; See, what I meant? She knew me too well. Those 
dreams and flashes were driving me crazy and there was that undeniable 
urge in me that told me I would regret never figuring out this 
mystery, meeting those two woman that were the center of the images.
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; I matched the elemental&#39;s tone. &quot;Seems like I&#39;m going to 
take Kinomoto-san up on that offer. Let&#39;s see what I can get out of 
her.&quot;
	Soyo-chan smiled lopsidedly. &quot;Yup, that&#39;s my Lisa.&quot; With a 
slight flash of golden-yellow she went back into spiritual form and 
seemingly disappeared in the surface of the ring on my finger.
	I walked over to the dresser and picked up the picture showing a 
middle-aged couple in front of the Bremer Dom, the date was of several 
years ago. Then I put it down again with a wistful sigh and headed 
downstairs for dinner.

******************************

&lt;March 13 (Minako)&gt;
It was getting notoriously difficult to move around without help, I 
noted sarcastically as I plopped down on the couch, having retrieved 
something to drink. Spring had hit Tokyo early this year... well, 
considering you could call well over twenty degrees spring. More like 
early summer and while the spacious rooms and hallways in the manor 
were noticeably cooler than that of a normal house, there was a 
definite humidness in the air that was at all not mixing with the 
growing signs and limitations of my condition.
	My condition... There was one thing I couldn&#39;t tire but 
constantly think about. Ever since that evening with Makoto and Hotaru 
where a temporary... agreement had been established, one thing had 
slowly but surely crept out from the veil of unconscious denial I had 
placed over it. No longer having the outlet of utter frustration since 
my... lovers gladly took care of that, I could not prevent from taking 
note of the one undeniable fact anymore.
	I was pregnant.
	I was going to be a mother.
	Okay, maybe those were two facts but hey, could you blame me? 
Guess not. The truth hit me hard when I finally reckoned it for what 
it was. The realization had been kind of breathtaking, still was. And 
now being almost five months along - about six or early seven by the 
slightly accelerated rate calculated by Ami - there was no point in 
denying it anymore.
	&quot;Hey, why so gloomy?&quot; I glanced to see that Makoto had entered 
the room unnoticed, being too absorbed in my reflections. My brunette 
friend looked at me quizzically before glancing down at the glass in 
obvious comprehension.
	&quot;You are right, this weather isn&#39;t normal. Must be more signs 
for well, you know what,&quot; she stated and sat down next to me on the 
couch. I didn&#39;t even hesitate to lean onto the taller woman when her 
arm slipped around my shoulders. I WAS getting tired very easily after 
all. The limitations were by far not as extreme as that of a normal 
pregnancy for some bizarre scientific-magical reason I had not 
bothered to try and understand. In fact the amount of growth shown 
outwardly at my belly was barely half as much as it should be. I 
understood as much as that had something to do with the fact that the 
child had more or less been conceived in a union of three pure souls 
but beyond that I tended to leave the details to Hotaru. The 
inconvenience this state put on my body was still big enough for me 
and I hated the temporary but steadily more increasing fits of 
weakness and exhaustion.
	&quot;I hate being so powerless,&quot; I confessed, not implying just my 
physical state and helplessness should it come to a serious fight 
which alone gnawed on my ego and sense of responsibility enough. I was 
their leader after all and I was bound to a sitting or lying position 
most of the time. No, that wasn&#39;t all. After Hotaru&#39;s discovery 
meetings had been called, explanations being made but Hotaru had also 
said that all we could really do now was wait and see. That didn&#39;t met 
well with many of the others - neither did it with the three of us - 
but I could see the point that there really was not much we could do 
considering the possible threat was still locked inside its cage at 
the moment. A threat that - according to Hotaru - was clearly in the 
class of apocalyptic. I had rarely seen the expression of... fear in 
Saturn&#39;s eyes and that alone was enough to put everyone on guard. On 
guard for a shapeless and physical not present enemy.
	&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Makoto said quietly, unconsciously her 
free hand was drawing lazy circles over my belly. It had been kind of 
a routine, an unspoken agreement since that evening. I found myself 
amazed again and again at the level of compassion and support that was 
provided by the two other girls... no, really young woman already in 
all but actual public acknowledgment in Hotaru&#39;s case. The display of 
maturity was beyond that of mere children. We were all grown up now. I 
still felt rather unworthy of all that attention directed at me, 
considering how badly I had treated them at first and how much a part 
of me still refused to allow a suitable response.
	I had watched the lazy motions of Makoto&#39;s hands for some time 
when looked up at her with an unreadable expression on my face, 
desperately wanting to force the words out but once again feeling 
myself incapable of doing the deed. Makoto seemed to know exactly what 
was going on inside of me and put a brief but promising kiss on my 
lips before pulling her hand up to cup my cheek. &quot;I know. Onegai, 
don&#39;t rush yourself.&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re too good to me,&quot; I whispered, closing my eyes and 
enjoying the contact for what it was. Once let down in conscious 
awareness I had been unaware and quite unwilling to raise the barriers 
that had been let down through Hotaru&#39;s surprisingly forceful actions 
again. But there was still so much holding me back, so many more 
barriers that were hard to let go off. I WANTED to, believe me, I did 
but...
	&quot;You&#39;ve always been too good to me,&quot; I reinforced, overcome by 
memories of our teenage days. Makoto had been like the big sister of 
the Inners, sometimes even a mother figure. While often outgoing and 
direct, she was a surprisingly good listener to other people&#39;s 
problems and often had listened after the one or other misfired 
&#39;relationship&#39;. Back then I had still told myself that they meant 
something...
	&quot;Hey, stop that right now,&quot; Makoto chastened with a mock-cross 
expression and pulling back much to my displeasure. &quot;We are here for 
you no matter what and you need us or do you still deny that?&quot;
	I shook my head softly in reply. &quot;No, not anymore.&quot; Gazing back 
into the emerald eyes watching me expectedly but at the same time 
patiently I let out the breath I hadn&#39;t even realized I was holding. 
&quot;I&#39;m scared, Makoto. I&#39;m scared because I might really, I...&quot; Once 
again I felt the barriers smash into place but they had a name now. I 
realized how true the statement was even though the words came out 
without conscious thought. I was scared because THIS strange, abnormal 
and all out totally weird relationship was unlike all the pseudo 
pretenses I had hid under for so long and only recently let myself 
feel the effect it had on me in the presence of those two remarkable 
women. Only with them and only to a degree I allowed myself that 
luxury and this was already much further than I had ever allowed any 
boy or man to see the real me under the surface. And that fact scared 
me, scared me beyond belief.
	&quot;Shh, I know,&quot; Makoto hushed pulling me into a full embrace that 
I fell into with a sigh, another testament to how far I had already 
let myself fall.
	After several minutes of staying that way I disengaged from the 
hug, a sparkle of resolve building inside of me brought upon by the 
slow realization that there was really a baby growing inside of me 
now. This was something we all had neglected in the face of our 
personal problems and it was long time due that we made this step. 
&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; I said silently, knowing in a way that beyond this point 
there might as well be no turning back anymore. Not that the other two 
would ever let me. &quot;When Hotaru gets back... I want to go see Rei. 
It&#39;s time we really knew what happened that night.&quot;
	There wasn&#39;t a need to spell out to which night exactly I was 
referring to. It had been the catalyst for all this after all and the 
missing clarity, the inability to remember might have played its role 
in the long frustration and drama between the three of us. But I was 
going to be a mother soon - as amazing and hard to believe that fact 
was - and there was no way I would give birth not knowing exactly what 
happened on the night of conceiving and who was technically &quot;the 
father&quot;.
	&quot;Are you sure,&quot; Makoto asked tentatively. This was probably the 
first time we had even breached the subject.
	I nodded quietly, a firm resolve taking its place in my heart. 
If I was letting myself getting caught in this I would do so 
consciously and prepared.

******************************

(Hotaru)
Kind of ironic actually that it took circumstances like the attack 
about a month ago that the daughter of the former director and the 
junior partner of Neo Infinity began to meet regularly and talk more 
personally. I suppose we really were just to wrapped up in our own 
lives at the beginning and after that the opportunities were becoming 
scarce to nonexistent. I really wished we&#39;d had that meeting a year 
ago when the school was officially opened and I wished even more I had 
known back then about HER.
	The others hadn&#39;t taken well to the news and even less so to 
sitting around, idly waiting. But there really wasn&#39;t much more we 
could do at this point. Any kind of trying to meddle with the seal was 
out of the question as I made quite clear when the suggestion was 
brought up. We couldn&#39;t just go and well... reinforce it. The ancient 
seal was two hundred millennia old, already tempered with and who 
knows how close to breaking. The original creation had taken a high 
amount of individual sacrifices and weaved a complex net of power that 
the slightest mistake could upset. And besides, it&#39;s not like Sakura 
and Tomoyo hadn&#39;t tried that route already and actually succeeded in 
repairing the damage. Of course by then, it was already too late to do 
more than winning some time.
	Setsuna had surprised me the most actually. She had NOT known 
about Sakura and Tomoyo being the incarnations of Lina and Amelia 
until I told her. That worried me a lot, coupled with the fact that 
her time sight was considerably weakened, to a point where you could 
call it blocked. That had happened only once before. In the old war, 
shortly before the rise of the Silver Millennium. The implications 
were NOT all that comforting.
	&quot;So, let me get this right. You FOUND her but now Sakura-san is 
reluctant to tell her the full truth?&quot; I said to the other girl, 
sitting next to me. It was the end of a long day of classes. Seeing 
that the paranormal section didn&#39;t actually operate after a normal 
schedule, studying here was complex and challenging work and there 
wasn&#39;t just a relaxing phase at the end of a semester. The school 
calendar didn&#39;t really apply here. I had come to spend more and more 
time with the other girl in between classes and found her quite 
pleasant company. She was a lot more reserved than Amelia had been but 
I could see the same kind heart in her that I had seen in the young 
Queen of Saillune.
	Tomoyo nodded, concern clearly written in her face. &quot;It&#39;s kind 
of like your situation I think. One wrong word or action...&quot; She 
trailed off but the sentence didn&#39;t need to be verbally completed for 
me to understand its meaning.
	&quot;Yes, I can see that. If you come on too strong that might scare 
her away and I don&#39;t even want to think what an easy target that would 
make for Pandora to exploit.&quot; And there I thought I had it hard. At 
least She wasn&#39;t hunting Minako or something. The attack was a 
coincidence and I doubted Pandora would risk an agent with both Makoto 
and myself constantly around. Those two though... I couldn&#39;t help but 
admire Tomoyo for holding up so well under all the circumstances, but 
even more so I admired Sakura for the same reasons. Even before she 
had unlocked her memories as Lina, she had an encounter with the 
Feared One, an encounter that had to have left deep emotional scars. 
The memories of her past life must have been actually comforting in 
the long run. Most people would have crumbled under the weight of 
responsibility put on those two.
	&quot;Sakura thinks there already is some... connection.&quot; I looked 
sharply at Tomoyo. &quot;That&#39;s part of why she wants to go slow and 
well... undetected.&quot;
	&quot;You mean like avoiding to provoke a reaction from whatever link 
there is already?&quot; Tomoyo nodded and I scratched my chin in thought. 
&quot;A tough situation. You shouldn&#39;t wait too long though. The planet&#39;s 
becoming more and more restless. I dread to admit this but she&#39;ll make 
her move soon and Sylphiel&#39;s reincarnation IS the most likely target.&quot; 
Life was like that. A complex web of possibilities where according to 
our nature - which WAS chaos - one action could provoke several 
different reactions. Waiting though could very well trigger the 
possibility that was furthest away from your original goal. That&#39;s why 
I acted with Minako when I thought I had to and while we were still 
some distance away from resolving our situations, we were getting 
somewhere.
	Tomoyo was a rather quiet girl though. I had been able to 
observe some of the interaction between her and Sakura, the dynamics 
of their relationship, and figured out quickly enough that Tomoyo 
would usually be supportive of anything that her partner did, only 
speaking up when she really found it appropriate. It was kind of a 
quiet, passive position, dominating not so much through actions or 
words but small gestures and mere presence. If I had to draw a 
comparison, Tomoyo was kind of what Michiru-mama was to Haruka-papa. 
Tomoyo was the consciousness where Sakura was action.
	I glanced at my watch, noticing that it was getting late 
already. &quot;Look, I have to get home. Try to talk to Sakura about this. 
I really think we are running out of time and I&#39;d rather have you 
three together than apart when the fireworks start,&quot; I said, standing 
up.
	Tomoyo nodded and stood up as well. &quot;I was planning on doing 
that anyway. It&#39;s good to have a second opinion though.&quot; She smiled at 
me and I smiled back, mutual understanding passing between us. Our 
situations were quite similar as were our roles. Sakura might be the 
more outgoing party in their relationship but Tomoyo was the silent 
center, the rock in the raging sea so to say. I tended to view myself 
similarly as of late, trying to hold the fragile peace between Minako, 
Makoto and myself together.
	Lately though I wondered just whether or not I really was meant 
to be there, in their midst, or if I was just the initiator. Since 
settling into the semi-comfortable routine Makoto and Minako had spent 
a lot of time together. The brunette could afford to take a bit of 
time off from her work and training - it helped that she had rather 
understanding employers - to help our pregnant lover. Besides that, 
Makoto proved to be much versed when it came to everyday stuff and it 
became clear out of the three of us she might be best suited to take 
care of a child...
	I shook my head, chasing away the brief bout of insecurity. We 
were in this together and I wasn&#39;t going to back out now. After all it 
was more than highly likely that I was the genetic father - I could 
just see some experts getting a fit at the prospect - and I had a 
responsibility to fulfill.
	Saying goodbye to Tomoyo, I made my way back home.

******************************

&lt;March 17 (Makoto&gt;
&quot;This weather is getting more and more erratic,&quot; I muttered to myself 
and ducked back into the store I had just emerged from. In the ten 
minutes I had spent in there the sky had changed from blue and 
cloudless to a dark gray, unloading a massive rain shower down on the 
earth. I had barely felt it coming and even the little bit of warning 
I got was not enough to return home in time. I sure as hell was not 
going to run all the way to the apartment through the rain.
	Sighing I decided to do some more shopping. Well, at least 
looking at the various plants, flowers and similar gardening articles 
that lined the rows. This was one of my favorite places. It was 
neither really spacious or even commonly known, more like an insider 
hint, somewhat hidden in a side alley between two bigger stores.
	I stopped when I came across a stack of beautiful white lilies - 
Casablanca, Rei&#39;s favorite flower. I&#39;d have to remember to preorder 
some for her birthday next month. I knew that wasn&#39;t original and Rei 
always seemed to be rather wistful and reserved when she got them. I 
suspected it was something that happened in her past but I wasn&#39;t one 
to pry deeply if it wasn&#39;t of any direct concern to me. Lately though, 
actually ever since Sasami came to live at the Jinja, she was a lot 
more carefree and happy at her own birthday. &#39;That just proves again 
that love knows no boundaries&#39;, I mused with a smile on my lips.
	The smile turned into surprise when I turned around, catching 
sight of a familiar figure I had previously missed. I hadn&#39;t really 
paid much attention, just getting a couple of items and then planning 
on getting home again. Now, the flash of lavender hair was hard to 
mistake for anything else and surely enough, when my eyes settled on 
the woman in red Chinese robes talking with someone else at the 
moment, it turned out to be the person I had least expected to meet 
here.
	Deciding that the rain wouldn&#39;t let up for awhile, I went over 
to the pair and called out, &quot;Konnichi wa, Saotome-sensei.&quot; Well, 
okay... Technically she was my employer but since she was almost as 
versed as her husband in the art, I found myself taught some things by 
her as well.
	The woman turned away from her conversation, spotted me and 
smiled in greeting. &quot;Makoto-chan, what a pleasant surprise.&quot; I bowed 
briefly and the woman returned the gesture. Saotome Xian Pu was 
definitely a striking beauty, someone who&#39;d turn heads on every corner 
but she could also be very dignified and formal despite what other 
people had thought of her in her youth. I had heard some pretty wild 
stories regarding that particular time.
	&quot;It is nice to meet you too, Sensei. I am sorry I haven&#39;t been 
to work regularly.&quot;
	Xian Pu waved the issues away with a knowing smirk. &quot;It&#39;s 
alright. I understand completely. A pregnancy is a very important 
event in one&#39;s life after all and I&#39;m sure your... &#39;friend&#39; 
appreciates your help.&quot; Seeing the knowing gleam in the other woman&#39;s 
eyes I wondered briefly why I had even bothered to make a semi-cover 
story.
	Before I could dig my grave even deeper - judged by the mock 
predatory look I found myself at the receiving end of -, it was the 
other woman next to my employer that drew our mutual attention. She 
had simply stood to the side rather unnoticed until then
	&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;
	I turned surprised eyes to the speaker, taking in the features 
of a woman around Xian Pu&#39;s age, prime of her years really. A lean 
body that spoke of physical exertion - probably some form of Martial 
Art - and an outfit that made her look just the slightest bit 
tomboyish, in blue and black, a little like a kunoichi&#39;s. &quot;Excuse me, 
do I know...&quot; My inspection went back to the face, the brown hair and 
the white ribbon tied into it, and then the eyes... &quot;... you... 
Senpai?&quot;
	I blinked, reassuring myself that the hectic of the last month 
hadn&#39;t left some form of mental delusion, but except the fact - the 
rather disturbingly obvious fact - that the person in front of me was 
beyond doubt FEMALE, the features matched almost perfectly. SHE was 
definitely a lot more, um... cute, beautiful actually now that it was 
clear that she was of the fairer gender but... &quot;Um, you...&quot; I felt 
myself stutter, to stunned for coherent speech.
	&quot;You know each other?&quot; Xian Pu looked back and forth between us 
with a confused look on her face.
	The woman smiled ruefully. &quot;Oh yes, we do. Long history... well, 
okay actually short. We met in Junior High briefly, she kind of had a 
crush on me. Back then I was still pretending...&quot;
	My employer raised an eyebrow and then realization seemed to 
dawn upon her face, realization that I would give a lot to have right 
now because I was thoroughly confused. A wee bit hurt, too, because I 
had obviously been deceived. Not that I wasn&#39;t over that stupid crush 
by now, yet there was one thing that I didn&#39;t like. When I was 
deceived, played with. I wanted people to be honest with me as I tried 
to be honest with them. That attitude, I knew, didn&#39;t sit well with 
many people but I&#39;d rather have it that way when lying to myself or 
others.
	I folded my arms over my chest and gave the other woman a stern 
look, pushing away my confusion for the moment. &quot;What a surprise 
meeting you here, after all those years, Ukyo-&#39;kun&#39;,&quot; I said in the 
best icy tone I managed, not really able to give into anger since it 
was apparent the other brown-haired woman - come to think of it, as 
women we shared a good deal of features, almost like sisters - was 
already looking very guilty right now.
	&quot;Well I...&quot; Kuonji Ukyo sighed heavily, &quot;Gomen nasei, Mako-chan. 
I didn&#39;t mean to fool you deliberately. You have to understand it 
hadn&#39;t been the first time I pretended to be a boy, did that a lot 
actually until shortly after we, um... parted company.&quot; Yeah right, 
parted company, what a nice way of wording it. He... SHE had told me 
outright that there was someone else important in her life, not worded 
exactly like that but that was what I had concluded. I halted my train 
of thoughts, wondering briefly if I had made any snap judgments 
then...
	&quot;Right, I&#39;m sure Saki-chan knew all about it. How is she those 
days?&quot;
	Ukyo blinked, surprised. &quot;Saki-chan? I don&#39;t know. I had to move 
on shortly after you transferred... Mako-chan, there... Matte, you 
thought Saki and I were...&quot; I nodded and she groaned, holding a hand 
to her forehead. &quot;No, no, you got it all wrong. I posed as a boy for 
some personal reason that&#39;s really not all important right now. 
Makoto, I feel really sorry for what happened but you didn&#39;t even give 
me a chance to explain, you were just gone so quickly...&quot;
	I flushed at the reminder, realizing that I had acted like... 
well, the young teenage schoolgirl with a mad crush on my senpai that 
I had been. The day after he... kuso, SHE told me that there was 
someone else... now, that I think about it she had said SOMETHING and 
I had just jumped to conclusion. The next day I had almost welcomed 
the suggestion to transfer after I had got into another fight out of 
frustration mostly. I had told myself it would be easier than seeing 
them together...
	&quot;Oh...&quot; I grinned sheepishly. &quot;Guess that wasn&#39;t my smartest 
move, huh?&quot;
	Ukyo shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s okay. We were both young and a little 
foolish, I guess. I just hope there are no hard feelings because I 
really enjoyed your company and when you left...&quot; I blushed slightly 
at the comment, not able to completely ignore old feelings. &quot;I mean as 
a friend,&quot; the other woman emended quickly.
	I was going to say something when Xian Pu cut into the 
conversation again. &quot;You sure about that? I&#39;d be careful Makoto, 
Ucchan here likes to try and steal away other people&#39;s husbands.&quot; My 
old Senpai grimaced under the teasing comment and shot her 
purple-haired friend a dirty look to which the other pretended 
innocence. &quot;You see, &#39;Spatula Girl&#39; here,&quot; Ukyo winced at the obvious 
nickname, &quot;was one of Airen&#39;s other suitors a few years ago...&quot;
	That piqued my curiosity and seeing my old friend squirm 
uncomfortably I saw a good opportunity to not only pass the time but 
get back to my Senpai for - unwanted or not - deceiving me. &quot;Really? 
I&#39;d like to know all about that.&quot;

******************************

(Sakura)
Another of those unusual things about Neo Infinity, a student with an 
office... Well, okay, actually it was Tomoyo&#39;s or better the office of 
the anonymous partner that Tomoyo represented... Not to mention that 
technically I WAS old enough to be a teacher and still in my final 
year of High School - which Tomoyo and I minimized from three to two 
because most of the stuff became too boring... Now, if anyone should 
come to me complaining about how confusing their life is, I&#39;d... do 
some pretty nasty things!
	My thoughts were erratic again, familiar signs in a familiar 
situation. It was one of THE sessions again. Across from me sat the 
young teenage girl who had literally dropped into my life... after 
spending near to four years searching for her. Once more I felt the 
strange mix of feelings playing havoc in my heart. There was longing 
but there was also caution. And surprisingly enough they both came 
from the same source and that source was not my present life but the 
memories of Lina...
	The sessions had been informal at first. The first two times we 
talked mostly about the school and what the girl, Lisa, was supposed 
to expect. Then things slowly got more personal. I felt somewhat 
comfortable with hiding under the mask of the student head and 
questioning her about her life instead of revealing all the things I 
longed to say. We didn&#39;t have much time anymore, I could see that 
Pandora already had her talons at Lisa&#39;s neck, literally. The fact 
that she had been in the area for several months now and no attempt at 
tracking had ever met with fruition was a dead giveaway. And so I was 
careful to not probe too deep, too fast.
	Funny actually, both Tomoyo and I had been rather different 
persons, with rather different personalities and outer appearances in 
this life compared to those of Lina and Amelia. The striking 
similarity had literally blown me off my feet. Not just the physical 
appearance which was apart from some minor discrepancies a mirror 
image of her past life. No, even the setting was almost ridiculously 
similar. Lisa Whitelighter from what I had gathered had a rather 
diverse history with many blank pages that I was still trying to fill, 
yet the key facts were pretty much the same. Right now she was a miko 
at her grandmother&#39;s shrine and ironically enough her parents were 
deceased already... I had been digging for more information on this 
because I feared a possible taint that could be exploited and the 
result came back rather worrying. Apparently Lisa&#39;s parents had died 
in a fire roughly a year ago, shortly afterwards she had settled down 
here...
	&#39;It&#39;s not fair&#39;, I thought bitterly. &#39;Sylphiel lost her father 
to Copy Rezo&#39;s attack, why does this have to repeat itself?&#39; There was 
a somewhat cynic side to Lisa that I had gotten glimpses of, very 
brief and I doubt I&#39;d picked them up a few years ago when I had just 
been Sakura.
	&quot;Kinomoto-san, I appreciate your concern but could we get to the 
real cause of my visits? I did my research on the school already, you 
know?&quot; Lisa interrupted my thoughts as well as the semi-automatic 
explanations I had given on some of the subjects we were teaching her. 
Lisa had admitted to some latent control over Air magic and a healthy 
interest in elemental lore, especially elemental spirits. I couldn&#39;t 
help but wondering if her interest was more than just theoretically. 
If there was a Sylph or Sprite bound to her though I couldn&#39;t detect 
it... which wasn&#39;t so unusual given that elemental spirits - 
ESPECIALLY air spirits - were rather good at hiding their presence 
from even magical sight.
	I looked at the other girl more critically and once more felt 
the longing rise inside of me. It wasn&#39;t always as easy as I tried to 
portray it to Tomoyo. The side of me that was Lina&#39;s incarnation 
wasn&#39;t memories only. That&#39;s not how reincarnations work most of the 
time. A part of the old spirit makeup remained with the soul when it 
went on to the next cycle of life. If a person went through many 
incarnations whose spirits were rather different, the soul could turn 
out rather... colorful.
	I sighed, seeing the determined look in those green eyes. So 
determined, so much like her, so much like the time when... &quot;Do you 
really want me to do that?&quot; I asked quietly, for a moment dropping all 
pretense of the game of hide and seek that had started between us. 
Frankly I could tell that Lisa was a extraordinarily sharp person and 
seemed to have enough mystic knowledge that she&#39;d probably believe all 
that I could... that I wanted to tell her. Dealing with those 
revelations would be another story though.
	How could I tell her after all that happened to Sylphiel and me 
when we were roughly that age? The memories of that time were among 
the few that I really wished I had never remembered again in the first 
place. We had been so young and foolish and she had been just as 
determined to find out the horrible secret of my condition I had tried 
so hard to hide from the group. But it had been too much pressure and 
I had caved in under the gentle but unyielding pressure from the 
shrine maiden. And look where that ended...
	No, I couldn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t repeat this mistake. Logically I knew 
this was a different situation and despite the parallels Lisa was a 
different person, just like Tomoyo and I. However, the similarities 
made it rather painful to listen to reason and reminded me of those 
dark memories again and again.
	&quot;Let me see,&quot; Lisa broke into my train of thoughts again and her 
eyes flashed with quiet determination that didn&#39;t help at all to 
concentrate on the present. &quot;For several years now I had reoccurring 
dreams of people I&#39;ve never met before and I have the feeling you know 
exactly what they could mean,&quot; Lisa all but abandoned any form of 
holding back. We had slowly come to this point but it seemed the other 
girl had become tired of waiting.
	&quot;And what do YOU think these dreams mean?&quot; I asked, watching the 
other girl seemingly relaxed but inwardly torn at the prospect of the 
truth coming out. Despite all those weeks I had time to prepare for 
this moment, I was still not sure how to go about this. How do you 
tell a complete stranger - from their point of view - that they are 
the reincarnation of their past lover and life... if not soul mate, 
together with another girl who was also here and not to forget that 
she might become a target for an ancient demonic being soon that tried 
to revive a war that they had participated in many millennia ago... Oh 
right, easy enough. Tell her just that. I was sure she&#39;d feel 
overwhelmed by the responsibility and would like to do everything to 
help... just like Sylphiel... The shrine maiden had had no real idea 
what she was getting into but had still offered her help out of... I 
still didn&#39;t know what it had been, even with the benefit of a second 
perspective. I doubted it had been love at this point, there was still 
that infatuation thing with Gourry in the way. Actually, we both had 
no clear idea what was going on and I had been desperate... And while 
in the long run the situation had turned out alright, I&#39;d really like 
to spare her incarnation a similar fate.
	Once again there was the pressure though. Time was running 
short.
	&quot;I think they are glimpses of a past life and the two people I 
see most in them could very well be you, Kinomoto-san, and your 
girlfriend, Daidouji-san,&quot; Lisa stated in a matter of matter-of-fact 
tone that simply floored me. The Sylphiel I knew had always kept a 
certain innocence - some would call it naivety - even when she was 
older. But Lisa seemed to have a kind of observation skill I could 
easily compare to Tomoyo&#39;s. Sure our relationship was unofficially 
public knowledge among the students but Lisa had hardly spend enough 
time here to sound so... certain.
	I gave another long sigh and then stood up. It seemed there was 
no way around it. However, I wouldn&#39;t rush into this. I needed some 
time to really think this through and I should speak with Tomoyo too, 
maybe we should even do this together. As indecisive and torn inside 
as I was right now, I might end up saying the wrong things and there 
was no way that I would unintentionally bring hurt to that gentle 
girl... again. &#39;I don&#39;t know how close Pandora already is and 
therefore no one can tell how a wrong reaction might turn out&#39;, I 
argued with myself.
	Opening a drawer, I took out a tiny business card and handed it 
to an expectant Lisa. &quot;Meet us here next week, the same time. We&#39;ll 
talk then.&quot; This needed more careful planning. It might be a risk to 
wait any longer but enough people had gotten hurt in this and during 
the course of our past lives already, unintentionally or because of 
that monster. I would not willingly endanger Lisa and put her on that 
list myself.
	For a moment the other girl stared up and I had the feeling as 
if she would press the issue but then she also stood up and bowed 
curtly, taking the card. &quot;I will.&quot; And with that she turned around and 
exited the office, leaving me to my own troubled thoughts.

******************************

&lt;200012 BC ()&gt;
It was about a month or so after the defeat of Hellmaster Phibrizo 
that it all started and right now Lina felt that she would have been 
better off not returning alive from this encounter. How the hell 
exactly she had survived after calling the Golden Lord, the Lord of 
Nightmares, the CREATOR into her body was beyond her. She had no 
recollection from the point onwards when Phibrizo interfered with her 
casting in attempt to let the chaos energy run wild. All that she knew 
was from her friend&#39;s sketchy explanations that she had apparently 
been &#39;possessed&#39; by L-sama and had been returning back to the Sea or 
something like that. Gourry, the baka, had probably done some 
incredible stupid stunt and pulled her back at the last possible 
moment... Lina really wished he hadn&#39;t, as harsh as this might sound. 
Maybe then the events that had taken place over the last weeks could 
have been avoided. No, they would have never taken place!
	&#39;L-sama, I never felt so guilty before. Not even after that 
incident with Oneechan&#39;, Lina thought miserably, staring at the vacant 
spot next to her where minutes ago... or was it hours? She really 
didn&#39;t know. The point remained that up until this particular point 
Sylphiel had been there for the last several weeks of their travels.
	&#39;At least I&#39;ve got enough of a fill to sustain me for awhile... 
I hope&#39;, the redheaded sorceress added snidely in her silent musings, 
looking down at her hands. Hands that had wrought much destruction and 
yet never meaning real harm to anyone during those instances. That was 
just how she was, part of her nature. Despite what other people 
thought Lina took always great care with her magic. Even when casting 
a Dragon Slave in the center of a town... It was actually a quite 
impressive feat to pull one of WITHOUT harming the inhabitants 
lethally... Years of training and devotion to the Black Magic lore had 
taught her that control...
	&#39;Some control... Didn&#39;t do me a whole lot of good with this.&#39; 
Lina couldn&#39;t help but wonder if her radical orientation towards Black 
and Spiritual offense magic had brought her to this point. Most 
likely. Why else would she be in dire need of power from the opposite 
lore now? It hadn&#39;t seem that bad at the beginning and the events 
between Gaav&#39;s defeat and the eventual demise of Phibrizo had been so 
hectic - not to mention depressing - that Lina had not really paid 
much attention to the signs. Signs that had been there, at brief 
instances, since casting the Giga Slave on Shabranigdu/Rezo. In 
hindsight that might have nudged open the door. The straining use of 
two Ragna Blades in short order, with the full knowledge of what 
exactly she was casting there had begun to push it open. Accidentally 
calling L-sama in her body then literally ripped the door out of its 
imaginary hinges.
	The first night had been pure torture and the day afterwards she 
had made up some feeble excuse and went to look up the next capable 
cleric. The result wasn&#39;t very comforting. Apparently her entire mana 
had suffered a drastic imbalance from the excessive use of Chaos Magic 
and the worst part was that what she had used the magic for was just 
in alliance with her nature. By now Lina did understand that L-sama, 
Chaos personified, was more than just the ultimate Dark Lord. Chaos 
was neither Good nor Evil, it was a balance and at the same time a 
power of contradicting elements. On one side there was the longing to 
return to its original form but at the same time there also was the 
creation that steamed from the chaos. It was both balance and 
imbalance. A drive for preservation and destruction.
	But Lina was naturally attuned to the destructive part of magic. 
Not because she was evil. That&#39;s another prejudicial assumption by 
society. If Lina was EVIL, then why had she not turned the other way 
as things got too heated, why hadn&#39;t she accepted the Mazoku&#39;s offer 
to join them instead of making the suicidal attempt of fighting them 
for her life? No, Lina wasn&#39;t evil, just destructive. She fought her 
battles after the principle of fighting fire with fire. That&#39;s just 
how she was. Unfortunately that had only intensified her current 
&#39;condition&#39;.
	Before ever casting any Chaos Magic it had just been a general 
specialization in the Black Magic category. Nothing abnormal. In fact 
it was a given fact that every mage would end up specializing in one 
or two fields. And it was definitely not uncommon that this 
specialization would be determined by the mage&#39;s character and 
preferences. Really, until then, while it was just normal magic, 
everything was perfectly fine. But L-sama&#39;s spells had, in easy terms, 
overloaded her mana. The clerics she had consulted were rather baffled 
and feared that if the process would continue unhindered she might 
lose the ability to cast any White Magic at all. Not that she was good 
at it but the thought alone was frightening enough, not even to begin 
with the implications she was much too aware of as a trained 
sorceress.
	Lina figured it probably had to do with the enormous amounts of 
magic she had channeled in such a short time. The human body was not 
made for this kind of strain, not even one with Lina&#39;s magical energy 
capacities. And the overwhelming presence of L-sama temporally 
inhabiting her body had brought the keg to spill over.
	And the results weren&#39;t pretty in the slightest. For one thing 
Lina was now dependent on regular feedings of White Magic or otherwise 
the imbalanced mana would most likely end up either ripping her apart 
or driving her over the edge of sanity. Neither was really a 
preferable option but right now Lina would wish she could just take 
the former and be done with it.
	&#39;Why did she have to be so damn determined anyway? Must have 
been her healer&#39;s oath or something&#39;, Lina thought darkly, 
unconsciously cutting open a fingernail from all the abuse she was 
doing to them without noticing, too lost in her self-misery.
	That was another thing. After sneaking away for regular visits 
to a shrine, even going so far as planning their travel routes in a 
way that she wouldn&#39;t run short of opportunities, Lina quickly 
realized that the clean feedings were just barely enough to sustain 
her for the time until the next stop. In turn another side effect got 
stronger and stronger, the sexual urges, the silent cries of release 
her body tortured her with to the point where she had to resort to 
self-pleasure... But that was not really helping at all. Until that 
one night when they had been staying at an inn, short of rooms, and 
she had to share one with Sylphiel... and that on a night where she 
hadn&#39;t been able to get a feeding in awhile. Of course, with her luck, 
the often rather innocent and oblivious shrine maiden had noticed 
something was wrong, gently but firmly pressured her fellow sorceress 
for details and from there things had... escalated.
	&#39;It&#39;s your own damn fault for giving in and you know that.&#39; Lina 
had been in a mindset where the attempts of protest were feeble and 
insignificant in the face of a compassionate friend who was willing to 
help. Her body was crying out for another&#39;s touch and as far as she 
had buried it, Lina always had had some... favoring thoughts towards 
the fairer sex. Quite frankly, the redhead had put up not much a fight 
albeit her rational mind screaming at her that this could only end in 
disaster.
	And in disaster it ended. Don&#39;t get the wrong impression here. 
The secret nights between the two friends were, at first, quite... 
sensual if you really can use the term here. There really was some 
good deal of affection and the magic that Sylphiel was providing, 
amplified by the sexual act, left Lina feeling almost completely 
normal again for the first time in over a month. It was a widespread 
knowledge that the sexual act alone created magical energy in vast 
quantities and in a partnership of two mages was often the most 
effective way of refilling reserves. However, in Lina&#39;s case it wasn&#39;t 
so easy. The imbalance in her mana was also reflecting on her 
character in pushing her normal traits to extremes. Their sessions 
became more and more... violent. There was no nicer way of saying it. 
While the act sustained her balance, during it she was exposed to her 
raw needs and the influences of her impure mana, making her do things 
she never would have done otherwise.
	Last night everything had come to a crushing climax. She had 
finally gone too far, just as she had feared but could not prevent. 
This time she really had hurt the other girl that had so selflessly 
offered her help upon discovering Lina&#39;s problems. She had even 
drained the gentle shrine maiden far too much, to the point of near 
spiritual death and that alone left the distraught redhead disgusted 
at her own actions.
	Lina hadn&#39;t been surprised when she found upon waking that 
Sylphiel wasn&#39;t there anymore and through the tentative bond they had 
built up over the last weeks, she could tell that the other girl was 
neither in the inn or in the near vicinity. The redhead plopped back 
down on the bed and closed her eyes, desperately trying to force the 
tears away. The worst part of it all was that she had really come to 
care for the shrine maiden, to a point where she had almost been ready 
to call it love.

******************************

(Tomoyo)
I found Sakura, after spending some time searching, resting on the 
roof. She sat lotus-style and one would think the redheaded girl was 
lost in either deep thought or intense meditation... Not that there 
was such a thing as &#39;intense&#39; meditation since intensity was not the 
predestined goal of the act and defied furthermore the whole 
principle...
	But I suppose that is besides the point and maybe I was just 
stalling a little. In fact Sakura WAS emitting very intense feelings 
right now and I could tell with one glance her mood was rather sour 
and introversive. In other words, my mate was quietly brooding and it 
took no genius to discern the subject.
	&quot;This is the second time in all the years that I&#39;ve found you up 
here,&quot; I remarked softly but in a way that was forcing Sakura to 
acknowledge my presence. I sat down next to her, slipping an arm 
around her and leaning against her shoulder. The only other time I had 
ever seen her up here was a bit after the Seal Cards incident when she 
had assumed... more like steadfastly believed that I wouldn&#39;t be able 
to accept the possible addition of Sylphiel in our relationship, in 
whatever form it may come.
	&quot;It&#39;s called seeking solitude. You are not supposed to come 
after me and make me feel better,&quot; Sakura replied with a wry smile of 
affection, apparently finding it hard to hold onto the dark mood she 
had worked herself into. After seven years I still marveled at my 
apparent effect on the courageous, spirited girl next to me.
	&quot;Mmh, but it&#39;s part of my job description to cheer you up when 
you need it. Even or should I say especially when you don&#39;t want me 
to,&quot; I said in a casual tone but in reality I was a little nervous. 
Sakura had been rather tightlipped over her latest meeting with Lisa. 
However, the core information was easily enough extracted. On the one 
hand I was thrilled that Sakura was finally discarding her reluctance 
and was willing to make that much anticipated step but on the other 
hand I could still detect the wariness and the subtle stalling. The 
latter was a point I meant to discuss or more like openly stir my mate 
in the right direction.
	&quot;But you are not really here - or only here - to cheer me up, 
right?&quot; Sakura inquired as if reading my thoughts which the empathic 
link between us came very close to. Actually, telepathy is vastly 
overrated. Empathy is a much higher form of reading another human 
being. Thoughts can be confusing, deceiving sometimes - even to the 
own self. Emotions were open expressions of the heart, the true, 
unguarded nature of the living, unrestrained by social oppression or 
regulations. Thoughts could speak volumes but never get the finer 
points across. Emotions were like a complex woven poem or tale, 
expressing far more detail and less superficiality.
	&quot;No, I am not,&quot; I answered slowly and then timidly added, &quot;Can I 
be open?&quot;
	Sakura shook her head bemused with a smile conveying both 
affection and mild annoyance. &quot;Onegai, I insist. You don&#39;t do that 
often enough anyway.&quot;
	I blushed slightly, well aware of the fact that I rarely spoke 
up directly against Sakura, limiting myself to a guiding influence, a 
subtle consciousness. That suited me just fine and was far more within 
my nature as if directly arguing about a point with my girlfriend. Now 
though, I believed, I had to do something more active. &quot;I don&#39;t think 
we should wait another week. I spoke with Tomoe-san about this 
recently and share her opinion. We don&#39;t have much more time left and 
you of all people should know that we cannot afford us the luxury of 
sitting back, relaxing and hoping that everything will turn out to be 
alright.&quot;
	&quot;I wasn&#39;t...&quot; Sakura started a protest but I was already cutting 
in again, knowing that if I allowed this to turn into an actual 
argument before I brought my point across, my courage would surely 
waver and finally dissipate.
	&quot;Sakura, I am the last person who would think that you couldn&#39;t 
make everything alright,&quot; I smiled at the familiar words, the &#39;magic 
phrase&#39; but then sternly continued, &quot;but you can&#39;t achieve that 
sitting back and hoping everything WILL just be alright. That&#39;s not 
how it works and that is not like you. I&#39;ve watched this for far too 
long actually. My assessment of Lisa-san is that of a quiet but very 
perceptive young girl. That she apparently has dreams about her past 
life isn&#39;t very surprising to me and nor should it be to you. So tell 
me, why were you really hesitating and why are you still stalling even 
now, when it becomes clear that she is willing to know?&quot;
	The redheaded sorceress and Card Mistress sat in silence for a 
moment, actually seeming astonished at the speech. I suppressed a 
flush, knowing that this was necessary. I could already guess where 
most of Sakura&#39;s problem of dealing with the situation came from but 
it needed to be addressed. Especially for the sake of dealing with it.
	&quot;I don&#39;t want to mess something up again,&quot; Sakura spoke in a 
near whisper several seconds later. I waited patiently for her to 
further elaborate, not giving into the urge of denying her statement. 
She needed to bare her heart for now and why those moments often 
pained me I knew they were a sensitive and essential necessity. &quot;I 
couldn&#39;t protect you and Syaoran the first time around and I only 
realized what you felt for while I held you dying in my arms...&quot; A few 
tears slipped out of her eyes and with a pang in my heart I reached 
over to brush them away but did nothing further as Sakura resumed her 
monologue. &quot;Then I was almost too late in finding the Seal Cards and 
the result almost cost us all our lives and if you hadn&#39;t pulled off 
that Resurrection spell I would have once again made you sad.&quot; I 
squeezed Sakura&#39;s hand at that point and pulled her closer, sending 
reassuring waves over our link, telling her without words that I was 
here and would always be at her side.
	&quot;And then there&#39;s Syl-chan. Tomoyo, you have no idea what it was 
like to be experiencing the symptoms of mana overload as a teenager. I 
was young and while not na&iuml;ve still rather foolish in ever allowing 
something to happen between us. Oh sure, I needed &#39;it&#39; at this point 
more than anything else and I enjoyed our time together. But as I 
said... young and foolish. I couldn&#39;t control the urges and I hurt 
her, really hurt her. Not just physically but emotionally. Her 
trust... If I... Tomo-chan, I couldn&#39;t bear to make a mistake again 
and cause her hurt in any form and with Pandora already so close I...&quot;
	&quot;We,&quot; I silently but with a steely edge that bore no argument 
cut in. Sakura&#39;s head snapped up and turned to look at me, flinching 
slightly under the heated gaze meeting her own. &quot;You are doing it 
again, you are trying to put all the weight and responsibility upon 
your shoulders. I might not have your full range of memories but I 
believe we agreed - on this very roof - that we would both locate 
Sylphiel&#39;s reincarnation, protect her and accept consciously whatever 
impact that would have on our relationship. So what gives you the 
right do take all the responsibility here?&quot;
	A mixture of emotions flashed over Sakura&#39;s face and for a 
moment there was the brief spark that would ignite a counter argument. 
But that spark was extinguished practically in the same instance and 
what remained was a very demure and sheepish girl who many at Neo 
Infinity would have trouble recognizing as the intelligent and 
confident student head of the magic wing.
	Instead of making any verbal replies, Sakura reached into her 
pocket and drew out her cell phone, hit a button for auto dial and 
waited. I raised an eyebrow but she just sent a smile in my direction 
and I settled for waiting. After a few moments the other party had 
apparently answered the phone.
	&quot;Kinomoto Sakura desu. Is that you Lisa-san?&quot; Short pause in 
which my other eyebrow joined the first one. &quot;Perfect. I was wondering 
if you would mind if my partner and I could step by tomorrow. I am 
sorry this is so sudden but &#39;someone&#39; reminded me that this business 
we wished to discuss really can&#39;t be afforded to be put off any 
longer... No, no, that won&#39;t be necessary. Tomorrow afternoon I think 
would be alright...&quot;
	Shifting a little to reposition myself, I settled against the 
other girl more comfortably, content that this argument had been so 
easily resolved. That was much more like my Sakura, energetic and 
taking action when it was necessary. Obviously all that she needed was 
a reminder and someone to give her the necessary courage. And Sakura 
always insisted that I was the best suited and furthermore only 
candidate for that job.

******************************

&lt;March 17 (Minako)&gt;
The way we were trudging up the steps to the Hikawa Jinja I couldn&#39;t 
help but feel a little like some member of a royal family or a goddess 
being flanked by her most trusted servants. On the one side the tall 
brunette with a casual but ever-alert manner and on the other side the 
more quiet dark-haired girl who often seemed as if nothing could 
really faze her. Right now I could very well detect though the vibes 
of happiness and unguarded love. Hotaru was making no secret of her 
affection and so wasn&#39;t Makoto... but that was more or less true to 
character.
	&quot;You know,&quot; I mused aloud, &quot;if it was any other place I&#39;d be 
worried what people think of us.&quot; The comment was meant more in an 
attempt to break the nervous tension that had settled over us ever 
since I had brought up the suggestion that we&#39;d better do something 
about that memory leak. Especially since something was rather odd 
about this. I mean alcoholic blackout was a valid reason for a normal 
human... and even for a Senshi to a degree, at least for a short span 
of time. But even Hotaru after actually meditating on it for hours 
hadn&#39;t been able to dig up the memories from her subconsciousness.
	That wasn&#39;t all that I was nervous about. A small part of me was 
probably hoping that I might get some clues about Peitho. Oh sure, I 
could ask Hotaru but there was the whole barrier thing still there and 
I just couldn&#39;t get myself to admit to myself that I WAS curious about 
that past we supposedly shared. &#39;Got yourself in a nice situation, 
Minako.&#39; Frankly enough, it was becoming frustrating not being able to 
express the confusing mix of feelings the other two woman were 
stirring inside of me adequately. Their feelings were starting to 
affect me and at some points I wanted to just... just... See, what I 
meant? I had restrained myself for so long that it was hard to 
rediscover the ease of expressing my heart freely. It&#39;s not that I 
resented the way I had become, a hard-working, successful woman and 
respected warrior with a purpose, but Makoto and Hotaru were slowly 
breaking down those barriers.
	I felt both my hands being squeezed at the same time and was 
once again amazed at the harmony of both woman to either side 
obviously sensing my mood and thoughts turning towards those dark 
paths that they had been trying to steer me away from for the past 
weeks. Successfully so for the most part.
	&quot;Yeah sure, but considering the company, I think we would be 
insulting them if we DON&#39;T show who we are interested in,&quot; Makoto 
stated with a snicker and a hooded glance in my direction and further 
along at Hotaru on my other side. I felt myself blushing slightly and 
then we had already reached the top of the stairs, arriving on the 
courtyard of Hikawa Jinja, promptly being greeted by the first pair of 
&#39;them&#39;.
	Hikawa Jinja had never been THAT popular as it had been in these 
days. Oh sure, the shrine was the most visited in the area but in the 
greater sense, when it came to the whole of Tokyo or even just the 
ward... And all of that recent success had mostly been the achievement 
of those who were simply named the &quot;Miko Sisters&quot;. Rei had never been 
that talkative about how she got all the help from several different 
girls from several different areas but it had come rather timely, 
about two years ago when her grandfather had fallen almost gravely ill 
- but made a good recovery by now - and Rei had been forced to take 
over most of his duties of running the Jinja at a point where it was 
hard for us to offer much help because of our education and/or jobs.
	The funny thing was, all of us knew that Rei never was one to 
depend or even favor excessive company. She had always been a rather 
distant person who stroke me as rather lonely. However, that had 
gradually changed ever since Sasami&#39;s appearance exactly at the right 
moment when Rei really needed someone she could depend on. As I said, 
I didn&#39;t know all the details but if I could say anything with 
conviction then that Hikawa Jinja was a much happier place these days. 
You could literally feel the aura of a sanctuary around you when you 
stepped onto the shrine&#39;s grounds. A sanctuary especially for those 
misunderstood or recovering from some dark past.
	&quot;Hey! There you are, Rei-san has been waiting.&quot; The green-haired 
girl named Mizuki wearing a ponytail in a similar fashion as Makoto 
did called out when she spotted us. She was currently sweeping the 
ground. Not surprisingly not too far away the brown-haired Hitomi was 
looking through some supplies, also glancing up at her companion&#39;s 
exclamation. To be frank about it, those two were the most unusual of 
the &quot;couples&quot; living/working at Hikawa these days. I couldn&#39;t really 
pinpoint how far the state of their relationship was and the pairing 
seemed to be a rather odd one, having come across rather recently and 
not so much rooted in a long past together. Or at least that&#39;s what my 
&#39;radar&#39; was telling me.
	Sparing a few words of greeting in return, we followed Hitomi&#39;s 
directions who pointed us towards the main meditation room where the 
Holy Fire was located. I realized with some manner of guiltiness that 
we hadn&#39;t been here as often in the years since Galaxia&#39;s demise as we 
had been before that. Especially I hadn&#39;t and so I took in some of the 
changes that spoke clearly of Rei&#39;s influence; she was proving to be a 
much better manager of business for the Jinja as the old pervert had 
ever been. The current style had something more... modern, while still 
holding onto the somewhat ancient and traditional quality a shrine was 
supposed to emit.
	Just short of the prayer chamber we were greeted by the second 
pair. &quot;Just in time,&quot; the dark-haired Kagome said, &quot;Rei said she&#39;s 
finished with the cleansing.&quot; She smiled warmly at us and gestured for 
the door. Her companion sitting next to Kagome, equally dark haired 
but with her hair braded, nodded at us and Hotaru moved forward to 
carefully slide open the door.
	Now I wasn&#39;t overly spiritual-trained but there was no way even 
a totally inapt person could not perceive the purity of the chamber. 
Just entering into the room told you immediately that the girl sitting 
in front of the fire was very capable of what she was doing and if you 
had the pleasure of knowing the raven-haired miko you could tell that 
her powers had vastly increased over the years since she had been a 
young teenager with dreams of one day taking over the Jinja and 
becoming the successor of her grandfather. In my opinion, Rei already 
had succeeded at both goals in all but formal acknowledgment. None of 
us, not even Michiru, could hope to match her spiritual skill these 
days and that made her the most logical choice at attempting the great 
mystery resolving the life that was currently growing inside of me.
	&quot;I&#39;m glad you found time for us, Rei,&quot; Hotaru said in a manner 
of greeting but clearly expressing her gratitude.
	&quot;There is no need to thank me, Hotaru-chan. We are all family 
after all and that is the least I can do. Now let us see if we can&#39;t 
break down whatever blocks your memory of the conceiving night, ne?&quot; 
The wink didn&#39;t go unnoticed and I stubbornly suppressed the flush. 
Rei had become a lot more open with her feelings nowadays, too. 
Undoubtedly another side effect of the clearly positive influence of 
the younger, blue-haired girl whispering something in the head miko&#39;s 
ear before, with a short, polite bow, slipping out of the room.
	The nervousness began to return again but I refused to give into 
it. This was a necessity as I, myself, had pointed out, and if someone 
could draw out the clouded memories of THAT night, it would be Rei.
	There was the subtle hope that maybe this was just exactly what 
I needed to make sense and voice the feelings in my heart.

******************************

(Hotaru)
&quot;One warning before we begin,&quot; Rei drew my attention back to her. The 
three of us had all settled in front of the fire, our backs facing the 
hot, cleansing flame warming our backs and - since we were all psychic 
adepts to a degree - feeling it burn away any kind of negative 
thoughts or emotions. I didn&#39;t use to be here so often during the days 
of our frequent battles but the change in purity as well as potency 
was evident.
	My gaze had lingered for a moment on the obvious cause for the 
change in the Senshi of Fire. Here, in the cleansed atmosphere of the 
main prayer chamber, barriers and emotional shields were greatly 
reduced and despite some superficial differences I could have sworn 
Sasami and Tsunami were exactly the same person. But that was another 
issue that could be dealt with at a later point. Glancing at Rei, 
sitting lotus-style in front us facing the fire, I inclined my head in 
a gesture for her to continue.
	&quot;From what I gathered from your description, Hotaru-chan, there 
are some mental blocks that can&#39;t be easily overcome, so I will have 
to link minds with all of you and it will be inevitable that I 
experience some of those memories from an outside viewpoint just as 
much as you will.&quot;
	I had expected as much actually and didn&#39;t let myself show any 
reaction at all. Glancing at the side I could see Minako shift a 
little nervously and Makoto shrug nonchalantly. &quot;I would believe we 
are family here and trust each other that whatever gets revealed here 
will stay between the occupants of this room,&quot; I said finally and 
prodded both of the other woman at my side with a gentle stare until 
they eventually nodded in consent.
	&quot;Then let us begin,&quot; Rei closed her eyes and I did likewise, 
easily letting myself fall into a meditative trance. I could feel the 
close proximity of the other pure souls joining mine in a small 
cluster on the Astral Plane, the fiery glow of Rei hovering just a 
distance away. Knowing that none of my two lovers had the spiritual 
experience and level of concentration necessary, I already had to make 
most of the work. Gently extending my senses, I began to connect my 
mind with that of the other two who were - reluctantly at first - 
opening their own mental shields to allow the connection to settle in 
between their own awareness and my own, as well as establishing the 
remaining link between themselves following my example and guidance.
	Rei had meanwhile finished her own preparations and was 
extending her senses towards our linked minds, focusing imaginary, 
probing fingers on the memory parts hidden in our individual spirits 
and souls, drawing what had been blocked from our conscious awareness. 
A moment later a stream of blurry images began to flare before my 
mental eye - well, to be precise, we all shared one mental eye, so to 
speak, right now.
	This was not unlike the normal state of the memories we were 
seeking. Images shrouded in mist, too fast and too unfocused to be 
perceived by the waking mind. Slowly though the stream seemed to 
settle down, gradually adjusting the raging river it resembled to a 
clear lake. A lake in which stones were thrown, creating ripples, 
ripples producing individual images. But unlike the more coincidental 
impacts a stone thrown into a lake would produce, these were 
calculated. The images that soon formed together into more coherent 
and comprehendible memories were those that were of real importance 
right now. While not giving a full account they were fix points of the 
events and with them present in our memories, the missing gaps would 
be filled on their own.
	To be frank I expected something more... juicy to visualize 
first. What actually took form was a memory I vaguely remembered to 
earlier on in the evening of the party. Some of the others were 
dancing, precisely Usagi with Mamoru and Rei with Sasami... while 
Minako was acting a lot out of current character, mixing with the 
couples in  a clearly provocative manner, usual inhibitions reduced to 
a sliver of normality. That wasn&#39;t so much of importance - even though 
I did sense some of the embarrassment from our mutual love over our 
mind link. No, what was more important was the conversation I had been 
listening in on between Makoto and myself.
	I was - and there wasn&#39;t a nice way to put it - so drunk it hurt 
to look at, really. And if my adoptive parents ever learned about that 
I&#39;d sure get an earful. And in that detached, irrational state a plan 
was hatched that would have massive consequences, consequences I could 
only see now that we have reached the near conclusion of them. It had 
begun innocently enough, Makoto and I complaining in a depressed state 
about the unfairness of neither of us having any kind of chance with 
Minako. Makoto had tried to cheer me up, obviously trying to ignore 
her own feelings and push me in Minako&#39;s direction... I even dimly 
remembered some of that &#39;talk&#39; and now that I actually saw the scene 
the memories were coming back and I could almost predict the exchange 
that followed. Even while I wondered how exactly it had come to this 
point.
	&quot;... you probably would have to get her pregnant in order to get 
Mina-chan to really notice you.&quot; That was Makoto&#39;s - as I realized 
only now - attempt of dry humor, yet the statement turned out to 
become a catalyst in the events to come which had eventually led us to 
the point of today. I remembered dimly how Phoebe had somehow gotten 
the idea that the casual-meant comment could actually be achieved. A 
totally ridiculous challenge had ensured and in our mutual drunken 
states was executed with astonishing precision and success.
	*Hotaru was sure out of it... Wonder why that effected Saturn 
though,* I could hear Minako&#39;s thoughts as loud as the day. Even if I 
wanted to, in our current state there was no way I could block them 
out.
	*Minako?&quot; Makoto echoed moments before realization seemed to 
claim her and held back some kind of question she was about to... 
formulate.
	*We are linked right now. Totally harmony of our minds,* I 
explained to ease our other lover&#39;s apparent confusion. *But I am not 
able to answer that question. In all likelihood all of our Senshi 
aspects - especially Saturn - should never have been that effected to 
this degree. That is what really...* Something caught my attention and 
I mentally willed a replay of the last moments of the scene. I had 
just hopped of to start pestering Minako with clear intent to set my 
plan into motion but there was something I had noticed on the edge of 
my... no, Makoto&#39;s perception. *What&#39;s that?*
	*I remember feeling something... or someone... but didn&#39;t pay it 
much mind then,* Makoto mused and now I could feel the other two 
taking greater interest in the shadowy figure I had spotted. We 
watched in a mixture of astonishment and confusion as whoever it was 
apparently slipped something in Makoto&#39;s drink, neither one present 
even seeming to take notice of the intruder... And then I got a brief 
flash of the aura Makoto had picked up...
	I tried, I really did, but I couldn&#39;t suppress the mental scream 
of outrage at the realization of the exact identity of the mysterious 
visitor. Both Makoto and Minako recoiled somewhat at the 
uncharacteristic sneer before I willed myself to calm down enough to 
say with an exasperated sigh, &quot;I should have known it was him. I swear 
when he shows his face around here again, I&#39;m going to have a few 
words with that meddling... Not that it will do any good...*
	*Um, you know that guy?* Minako tentatively asked and I sensed a 
spark of recognition from her as well.
	*We did, yes. That is the most notorious, meddling Mazoku - a 
kind of demon race though I wouldn&#39;t define him as &#39;Evil&#39; in the sense 
you are thinking of - that has ever wandered this planet. True to his 
nature he likes to call himself the Mysterious Priest, Xelloss.&quot;

******************************

(Makoto)
It was about an hour later when the mental trip down memory lane was 
finally finished. It had felt more like a few minutes actually but I 
had long since learned to never go by simple scientific logic, not 
that I was any good at the field myself. After the first big 
discovery, the process had actually been rather swift and the first 
memory had already suited as a trigger to break through the blockage 
and the rest of the recreation of memories was more a reliving process 
than actual surprise. I was still rather amazed at some of the... err, 
more vivid images.
	One thing, however, had been made clear... No, let me rephrase 
that. The long expected fact was now visually confirmed. It had indeed 
been Hotaru who - under the semi-magical alcoholic influence - had 
changed Minako&#39;s mirror and it had been her - and only her - that had 
initiated a complete gender transformation making it unmistakable 
clear that the child was hers. I had merely been present.
	I had taken a walk while the other two recovered from the 
somewhat straining mental exercise in their own manner... To be honest 
I felt rather tired myself but there was just so much on my mind that 
I needed to be alone for awhile. The truth had lurked in the corners 
of my mind for some time now but having it confirmed in such a vivid, 
detailed manner was a different thing altogether. Now, everything was 
brought into broad daylight and the implications were sending my mind 
and heart reeling, wondering where my place in all this was. As 
expected the child was Minako and Hotaru&#39;s.
	Then there was the aspect of past lover&#39;s reincarnated and I was 
not oblivious to the signs, the spark of rekindling between the two 
while my relationship on both ends seemed to stagnate from my point of 
view. All major steps in our current arrangement had apparently 
something to do with them, never really with me. I merely was there. I 
tried frantically to deny it, but more and more I could see that 
eventually the place in our relationship that I occupied would lose 
its worth... if it ever had any in the first place.
	I stopped and retreated back behind the corner when I spotted 
two figures ahead. My aimless stroll had led me outside onto the 
porch. Obviously someone else had had the same idea. From what I could 
see Rei had just recently joined Minako on the wooden planks and there 
was a semi-heavy silence between them. I debated joining them but was 
actually curious to what would be discussed. A curiosity sparked by a 
glimmer of hope in my depressed state. I didn&#39;t know what I hoped to 
gain but somehow my instincts were telling me to stand back and 
listen.
	&quot;I can&#39;t say that I know how it is being with child, so I 
probably shouldn&#39;t apply wise suggestions about the topic,&quot; Rei began 
and I had to smile. None of us, except our Princess, could probably 
speak from experience on the topic. And I had never seen Usagi do so 
in all the time since Minako&#39;s pregnancy was revealed - which stroke 
me as rather odd. But I had other things to focus on then, so I didn&#39;t 
pay it much mind. Besides, Usagi would probably have her reasons.
	Minako laughed softly. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if anyone can supply any 
sufficient advice under these particular circumstances. It&#39;s not 
really like what you read in the books or what a normal physician 
could help you with.&quot; Which was certainly true. Being a creation from 
two Senshi, two powerful ones at that, there were certain differences 
in the actual pregnancy which I still had trouble actually 
comprehending. I was rather glad at least Hotaru seemed to understand 
them... She was the technical father after all, so that was her duty 
anyway. Not like me...
	A heavy sigh from Minako drew my attention back to the pair and 
I could see the obvious tension and frustration having spent so much 
time around the blonde lately that I had learned to recognize body 
language and other signs almost unconsciously. &quot;I hoped actually 
unlocking the memories would also help me with my own problems at 
expressing my feelings...&quot;
	The old problem again. Minako had made remarkable process and 
she wasn&#39;t hesitating anymore to seek and accept our provided comfort. 
But, except from the barely conscious signs that I thought to have 
picked up towards Hotaru, the lack of an emotional acknowledge apart 
from the physical one was still present. It pained me because both 
Hotaru and I could see the struggle and her obvious inability to break 
the chains she had restricted herself with.
	&quot;Maybe I was right after all. Maybe I am really meant to be 
alone so that I can perform my duty at the best of my abilities,&quot; 
Minako added bitterly after a moment passed and I was almost compelled 
to the immediate gut reaction of stepping out from concealment and 
crushing that foolish notion right away. But Rei was obviously just as 
equipped to handle the situation.
	&quot;Do you really think this is all about duty? That is a rather 
pity excuse you are raising in self-defense here.&quot; The blonde woman 
looked sharply at the dark-haired priestess from whose form the glare 
seemed to glide off harmlessly like from a smooth surface. &quot;Tell me, 
Minako-chan. What is it you feel for those two?&quot;
	&quot;But that&#39;s just the...&quot; my lover started to protest.
	Rei waved the argument away. &quot;Nonsense. This has nothing to do 
with your duty, OUR duty.&quot; Minako flinched at the emphasis. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
see that we all share the same path? You&#39;d give your live for 
Usagi-chan, alright. But so would I, so would Makoto and Hotaru.&quot; I 
had to silently agree with Rei&#39;s words, beginning to realize where she 
was heading with her argument. &quot;Take a look at Uranus and Neptune. Did 
you ever have the impression that their relationship would interfere 
with their duty?&quot;
	&quot;No,&quot; Minako silently conceded.
	&quot;Why is that?&quot;
	There was a moment of hesitation before Minako answered. 
&quot;Because whatever they do, they do it together. As part of a symbiotic 
relationship where one always follows the other.&quot; After another slight 
pause she added, &quot;It&#39;s amazing. But also scary.&quot;
	Rei nodded in wordless agreement and another period of silence 
elapsed. &quot;I once thought I didn&#39;t need love.&quot; At Minako&#39;s - and my own 
- curious glance, Rei elaborated further, &quot;I had made some... bad 
experiences. My parental role model was, let us say, leaving much to 
be desired for and whenever I let someone close it just ended in 
disappointment. You are probably reasoning that those relationships 
you entertained are a fa&ccedil;ade and maybe that is so. But for what 
purpose? To not allow the true depth that comes with a true love? Or 
to not getting hurt again?&quot; You could almost hear Minako shiver and 
for a short moment the yard was bathed in deathly silence, even the 
birds had stopped chirping.
	Slowly the blonde woman exhaled the breath she had been holding. 
&quot;M-Maybe you are right. I really don&#39;t know what to think right now. 
But they both did so much for me, they both deserve so much more and 
I...&quot; Abruptly Minako got up and began to walk off in the opposite 
direction from where I was standing. I would have probably listened to 
the urge to follow her since the distress in my lover was evident to 
the most blind fool. However, her last words had a kind of paralyzing 
effect on me and so I stood a bit too long to effectively catch up to 
her retreating form. That last statement had come closer to any 
emotional revelation Minako had made in our presence. And against my 
expectations she had not made any distinctions or separated comments. 
It was &quot;both of us&quot; she had addressed...
	I shook my head. That could mean anything and it was apparent 
that Minako was still confused about her feelings and would have to 
resolve them soon. And then she did what kind of lasting impact would 
I have on that decision? Despite the lack of a clear declaration the 
last now almost two months had been among the happiest in my young 
life and I was fearing the consequences of the decision that was 
already made and just needed to be voiced. Yet, they belonged 
together. That had been my initial intention when I tried to take 
advantage of the situation at the party by pushing Minako and Hotaru 
closer together. Somehow I had simply gotten roped in on the action 
that ensured...
	&#39;I would not have done what I did last night if I did not 
believe I could fall in love with you this way. And whatever happens, 
I will not just discard you when a better opportunity arises. For that 
I have grown too close to you over the last year.&#39;
	That&#39;s what Hotaru said to me and I desperately clung to those 
words. I knew it would be the most sensible thing to step away now and 
let the love between those two blossom fully, but the truth was I 
didn&#39;t want to. And that wasn&#39;t just because of Minako. It was also 
because I hadn&#39;t been able to respond properly that day to Hotaru&#39;s 
heartfelt declaration. Now, now I was pretty sure that while my mind 
found it most logical to eject myself from the three-way arrangement, 
my heart could not bear the thought of cutting itself from either of 
the two woman.
	&quot;Your soul mates are going to face a crisis soon, a crisis that 
will bring about a turning point in your relationship.&quot; I battled the 
impulse of jumping upwards and clinging to the ceiling in shock - 
almost failing to do so - as the gentle, melodic voice appeared from 
right next to me. I had been so absorbed in my inner debate that I had 
not noticed the approach. My head swiveled to the sight to settle upon 
the form of Masaki Sasami standing there casually and relaxed and yet 
her pinkish-red eyes reflected a distant, concentrated expression. 
&quot;Whatever happens. You must stand at your mates&#39; side regardless of 
your own doubts. If you don&#39;t, then there will be no happiness... for 
either of you.&quot;
	Before I could formulate the thought for asking about the 
cryptic warning, Sasami stepped around the corner and shortly joined 
Rei on the front porch, leaving me to process the words that were 
continuing to spin in my mind like blinding red warning lights. I 
didn&#39;t know why but somehow I knew that ignoring or not heeding the 
warning would be the most stupid move I had ever made.
	Then something else filtered through the chill the ominous 
warning had produced.
	&#39;Soul mates?!?&#39;

******************************

(Rei)
It was about a quarter hour later that I found myself heading back 
into the Jinja after seeing the other three Senshi off. Minako seemed 
to have composed herself, I even believed she had briefly talked with 
Hotaru before they decided to head home. I wouldn&#39;t have minded if 
they&#39;d stayed for dinner or something, especially with Minako&#39;s 
condition, but I wasn&#39;t one to force the point.
	I found Sasami in the small kitchen of the shrine area busying 
herself with cooking something that - as was standard - smelled rather 
delicious and a tea kettle was also in preparation. Standard signs of 
distraction. There were a lot of things that I still didn&#39;t know about 
my recent lover but I had by now discerned that Sasami&#39;s habit of 
cooking for the household - including the rest of our loose sisterhood 
- was not only just something she liked to do. She once confided in me 
that cooking had been her way of expressing her love to her family and 
friends. Yet, there had been instances that it had become painfully 
clear that the activity also provided a quasi retreat, masking the 
occasions when she was clearly worried about something. Like right 
now. She hadn&#39;t said anything when she joined me outside but from her 
body language alone I could tell that there was an inner conflict. An 
analogy that should be taken rather literally.
	I stepped up behind the girl that just from appearance alone 
looked so much like Usagi... or any other member of the royal family 
for that matter. That is one of the things I still was not sure about 
Masaki Sasami. I knew a lot of things about her past though that I&#39;m 
pretty sure would put some of the others on edge, especially the 
Outers. Not that there was any need to worry but they were known to 
overreact at times in matters of security. And while I did not know if 
there was really any relation between the Royal Family and her at all, 
I was pretty sure right now that whatever was bothering her at the 
moment had something to do with the many secrets the girl harbored.
	This was not just an assumption. I hadn&#39;t become what I was 
today by just idly sitting around and relying on what I&#39;ve learned in 
my youth or my Senshi abilities. Right now I was about the closest to 
what I ever wanted to be. A trained priestess with all my abilities - 
and those were quite a lot thanks to my second identity - finely tuned 
and sharpened almost to the edge of possibility. I believe that was a 
common trait among our group, probably a common trait among Senshi, or 
to be even more exact among beings with pure souls. We were awfully 
competitive. We would push ourselves to our limits to reach our utmost 
maximum and hoping to one day push beyond it. This was not just a 
manifestation of our duty, a way to get better in protecting what we 
held dear. The mechanism was tied to our very nature. And in this case 
the bond that had been created between Sasami and I over the last two 
years now allowed me to be nearly hundred percent sure what exactly 
was bothering her.
	&quot;So, what was this warning about that you gave Mako-chan? 
Another precognitive dream?&quot; I gently took her into an embrace and 
proceeded to slowly but firmly drag her away from her current task and 
to the table where I proceeded to sit down with Sasami in my lap. Now, 
I was aware of the rumors mind you, and I believed they were by far 
exaggerated - which lay in the nature of rumors I suppose. Two years 
ago, when the younger girl literally dropped into my life I had 
probably been rather ashamed and/or outraged at such stories being 
told about Hikawa Jinja - it was bad enough considering Ojijisan&#39;s 
reputation. Much had changed and I didn&#39;t care all that much about it. 
Sasami had helped me to open up more and gradually I had found my 
special person in the manifold creature - again in the literal sense 
of the word - before I even really knew it. She was the greatest gift 
ever given to me next to my family - meaning the other Senshi and 
those attached to it, not the miserable excuse for a father - and so I 
wasn&#39;t going to idly sit by when she had an obvious problem with 
something.
	&quot;I don&#39;t have the dreams anymore. Not the way you think, 
anyway.&quot; I winced slightly at the fierce grip she maintained with her 
arms around my waist. I reached up to turn her head so that our eyes 
were meeting. Her eyes could hold so much emotion, both vivid, 
youthful and mischievous at times and secretive, mysterious to 
downright brooding and gloomy at others. A delicate balance brought 
about by the overlapping personalities. If anyone ever came close to 
resembling Hotaru and Saturn&#39;s relationship it was the physically 
younger girl currently resting in my lap, her forehead touching mine. 
In a whisper she answered my silent question. &quot;We&#39;re close to 
assimilation.&quot;
	&quot;Oh.&quot; It took me a moment to digest this. Sasami knew I didn&#39;t 
like lying to my friends and fellow teammates, we were like sisters 
actually. However, she had raised a couple of valid points and I had 
finally conceded. The other girl had made it clear that she had no 
problem with revealing her secrets to the others but the time wasn&#39;t 
right. Having dealt with Pluto I knew when to concur to superior 
ancient wisdom - which one of Sasami&#39;s aspects definitely possessed - 
and kept silent. And it hadn&#39;t seemed THAT important. After all there 
was peace when some of the secret past&#39;s of the &quot;Miko Sisters&quot; had 
surfaced. However, now the situation was dire and Sasami seemed to 
possess some knowledge about it although she stated clearly that there 
wasn&#39;t anything she could contribute at the moment that any of the 
others that had been present at Pandora&#39;s original capture couldn&#39;t.
	The point was, I trusted this girl. I couldn&#39;t really tell why 
only that she had a striking similar aura, while more mysterious in 
nature, as our Princess and it was a given fact that any of us would 
follow Usagi to the gates of hell and back.
	Sasami closed her eyes as if reading my thoughts. Well, she 
probably did something close to it. While our bond was still rather 
fresh - really roughly a year and a couple of months wasn&#39;t long when 
compared to others around here who had benefits of relationships 
rooted in reincarnations - the trust had quickly developed and against 
my prior experiences had not been broken... yet.
	&quot;I&#39;m not sure I deserve that trust...&quot; Sasami started but I 
hushed her with a finger to her lips followed by a kiss.
	When I pulled away I said, &quot;Now, let&#39;s do that again. Maybe what 
I hear I won&#39;t like but I am willing to believe that you know what you 
are doing.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s not so much a matter of knowing what I am doing... or will 
have to do,&quot; the blue-haired girl explained. &quot;It&#39;s more that I hate 
myself for knowing what will happen soon and that I cannot change it, 
that I HAVE TO watch and let it happen. Tsunami had to do that a lot 
but it&#39;s never been easy either...&quot; I couldn&#39;t say that I could really 
relate. This was more up Pluto&#39;s corner I suppose since the problem 
sounded an awful lot what the Time Guardian might have to deal with on 
a regular basis - the fall of the Silver Millennium for example. I 
tried to work around the encrypted answers, knowing that I wouldn&#39;t 
get a direct answer until whatever event she was talking had passed. I 
had become pretty good at that during the period of time we&#39;ve been 
living together.
	&quot;This IS about the warning, right? Something is going to happen 
to them and soon...&quot; Sasami looked away in shame and I was torn 
between comforting my girlfriend and probing deeper for an answer.
	That was when my sensed flared in alarm, warning me that the 
holy grounds of the Jinja had just been invaded by something awfully 
powerful and EVIL. I had rarely ever felt such an enormously dark 
presence. No, not the presence was evil. The dark aura was more like a 
cloak, an affiliation to a higher power that I often had felt within a 
mindless minion sent by a greater force. But the level of darkness was 
frighteningly even from within her.
	I wanted to jump up and investigate but found myself unable to 
move, quite amazed at the physical strength in the younger girl who 
remained sitting in my lap. &quot;Sasami, what...?&quot; It became painfully 
obvious that she hadn&#39;t been talking about an event in the near future 
but rather close to the present.
	&quot;Not yet,&quot; Sasami said, the twin circular markings on her 
forehead evident, having replaced the usual triangle, they were 
flaring with a bright light right now which was entrancing to even one 
with the spiritual training and abilities I had. I could not move, 
even though I wanted to.
	And from the other girl&#39;s point of view that was good because 
when a piercing shriek of outrage and fear disrupted the silence of 
the room nothing could have physically restrained me. I opened my 
mouth to protest, to demand why Sasami was holding me back. That was 
obviously Hotaru&#39;s voice and the nature of the scream was suggesting 
something VERY bad had just happened and there would be a truly 
furious Saturn on the loose very soon.
	&quot;Trust me, please. If you really want to trust me, then do it 
now. We&#39;ll be joining them shortly.&quot; And true to her word, I could 
feel power gathering around us, enveloping us in a bluish aura and a 
moment later we found ourselves outside in the yard. It took me a 
moment to reorient myself but when my eyes fell on the scene before 
me, a cold feeling began to grip my heart...

******************************^

(Lisa)
Anxiety was slowly eating its way inside my heart. It was at the same 
time a new and a familiar feeling. Something was going to happen 
today, I just knew it. The sensation had slowly grown stronger since 
yesterday, creeping up my spine and spreading throughout my whole 
body. I had barely been able to sleep, a numbing fear that even I 
could not understand awakening me every hour or so. That only helped 
to intensify the nervousness, I was on the edge of panic really.
	All had started with the vision I got yesterday evening during a 
meditation setting. Well, at first it didn&#39;t seem like a vision, more 
like another memory... or memories. They seemed to be clearer for some 
reason than the flashes I had had before. They were significant 
memories, I was sure about that, yet I still couldn&#39;t form a bigger 
picture from the pieces.
	There was one though that really shook me. The details were 
blurry but the setting for some reason was quite clear to me. Although 
there weren&#39;t any indications for the exact nature of the event that 
was transpiring I felt with a unmistakable clarity, an absolute 
certainty that I had just experienced the final moments of my life... 
former life. The question mark that was still put tentatively behind 
the assumption was washed away by the memory.
	The little few details I remembered were not really helpful 
beyond this realization. I - or that other me - had been performing 
some kind of spell. A spell so intensively powerful that it was 
draining every last reservoir of life energy, every last drop of mana. 
I had known then that such an exertion would be lethal but still kept 
on going, the alternative somehow - although I couldn&#39;t remember why - 
invoking an even greater terror in my soul. Failure was not an option. 
Even if it meant leaving everything behind that was dear to me. I had 
caught glimpses of the other two, by now familiar women, the same 
determined expression in their faces. And then I had seen IT.
	Enveloped in a dome of multi-colored magic so enormous and 
potent that you had the feeling of being crushed by just looking at 
it. That was nothing though compared to the distantly female face 
twisted in contempt, loathing and hate, the sheer WRONGNESS in an aura 
of such twisted potency I shuddered even now remembering it.
	I think I spent an hour just calming down from the experience. 
Soyo-chan was profoundly worried as should be expected. Heck, worried 
didn&#39;t even cover what I was feeling, my heart had surely been a cold 
place right then and the feeling hadn&#39;t lessened much. I had been 
relieved when Kinomoto-san called and wished to advance our meeting. 
Yet, the feeling of dread, of impending doom hadn&#39;t left me and I 
almost had demanded to have that talk right then and there.
	Maybe I should have done it. They should be here soon but 
somehow I couldn&#39;t shake off the horrible feeling that it would be too 
late, too late for what I didn&#39;t know. Just simply too late... I 
wished I had spoken up earlier. Kinomoto was clearly stalling, 
reluctant for some reason I could not fathom to part with obvious 
knowledge regarding my dreams, regarding my former life... our former 
life.
	By now pretty much all doubts had been erased that the two women 
dominant in my dreams were identical with Kinomoto Sakura and Daidouji 
Tomoyo. However, I still couldn&#39;t figure out what exactly our 
relationship had been. I had a pretty good idea, yet there was too 
little information, to little facts that could assure me. And even if 
it was true, where was my place in all this? I needed to know my 
place, about the nature of the connection that the three of us 
apparently shared in some manner. It was a vivid urge by now, an 
undeniable necessity.
	I shook my head to try and clear my thoughts, trying to focus of 
what lay ahead. I probably was just worrying over nothing. More likely 
than not everything would turn out alright, maybe the vision and those 
feelings starting to consume me were just there to warn me. Yet... The 
ache in my heart remained, the desperate longing for something that 
wasn&#39;t there anymore, wasn&#39;t there yet, wasn&#39;t... I couldn&#39;t shake off 
that feeling and one memory came again and again, unbidden. The one 
time I had experienced similar symptoms, the sense that something 
awful was about to happen... I had heeded the warning signals then, 
not wanting to believe. Shortly afterwards our home, my parents...
	A few tears slid to the ground unhindered before I wiped them 
away with an angry and frustrated hand gesture. Times like this I 
really did loathe my talents, the spiritual gifts I had been bestowed 
with. It had gotten better, easier, with Soyo-chan helping but for as 
long as I remembered there was a restlessness inside of me that had 
driven me onwards, driven me to travel abroad even against the wishes 
and fears of my parents. I had found my best friend during those 
travels but I hadn&#39;t yet found my purpose.
	The purpose that was here, in Tokyo. I had felt it briefly when 
I visited Babasan about four years ago. I had felt something briefly 
touch me, a sensation of belonging. Which was what had eventually 
decided to bring me back here after everything fell to pieces back 
home. My purpose was here, beyond a doubt. It was so close now... and 
yet I couldn&#39;t quench the fear that it would be taken away from me 
just inches from my fingertips.
	I wish they would just hurry up and come! I regretted now not 
giving into the impulse earlier... like yesterday. It would have been 
soon enough yesterday, I just knew it. I had by now expected Soyokaze 
to come out, trying to cheer me up, talk some sense into me... Nothing 
of this had happened. She had been awfully quiet the whole morning, as 
if sharing the uneasy feeling steadily rising to a pitch. And so I 
just continued to sit there, on the front porch of the shrine, unsure 
what to do, how to react to this situation, to the overwhelming 
feeling of inevitable, dooming events to come. I didn&#39;t even know WHAT 
to prepare for!
	I pushed myself into a standing position. They should be here 
any moment now. Maybe there still was time, maybe I should go down the 
stairs and meet them, maybe...
	*Lisa!*
	My nerves were so strained I reacted with almost inhuman speed, 
whirling around to meet the presence of suffocating darkness that had 
invaded the shrine grounds. My power bubbled to the forefront, 
frantically erecting a mental barrier why I began to summon my 
partner&#39;s power to conjure a more physical barrier... All that 
happened in the space of mere moments and yet all that was in vain in 
the end.
	I was utterly unprepared for the close proximity, unprepared for 
the hideous form - not so much physically but from the mere astral 
vibes that it put out - being so close. Realizing with 
incomprehensible surprise that I wasn&#39;t going to be fast enough, a 
weak scream of fear escaped from my lips a tiny moment before the 
clearly inhuman assailant plunged something deep into my body, tearing 
not only through flesh but even more so through mental barriers, right 
into the very core of my being. My vision blurred and I could only 
hear the echo of the terrified scream of my partner elemental echoing 
in my mind.
	Then darkness claimed me and I fell into an endless void...

(Tomoyo)
We were about a block away from the Jinseikuro Jinja when a sharp pain 
like an arrow right through my heart made me stagger. I half-expected 
to be caught and questioned by Sakura but when I was finally able to 
glance to the side I could see that the redhead was just as 
distressed, her face contorted in a mixture of mental pain warring 
with intense concentration. The latter won in the end, but only by a 
margin and there was no telling how long that state would hold.
	&quot;Iie... Kuso...&quot; Sakura pressed out between clenched teeth and 
before I knew it we were flying. I didn&#39;t even pay much attention 
whether she was using Fly or a spell. It didn&#39;t really matter. I was 
more concerned with fighting against my own numbing pain that was 
worse than anything physical-inflicted could be like. This went right 
to the core, a ripple of literally soul-shattering agony raced into my 
soul through a connection I didn&#39;t know was even there.
	There wasn&#39;t a need for anyone to explain what had just happened 
to me... or maybe I should better say to her. This was similar to the 
experience of the link between Sakura and myself. Just as strong, just 
as sensitive...
	&#39;Sylphiel.&#39;
	Touching down in the yard not even a minute later - it still 
felt like an eternity -  agonizingly slow, too slow. My eyes settled 
upon the horrifying scene, all my... our worst fears materializing in 
that one moment. The demonic creature from about a month ago, that on 
first glance looked so weak enveloping the helpless and limb body of 
the one girl we had been searching for nearly four years now, that we 
had finally found, our hopes within close range of bearing fruition... 
The most traumatizing thing was once again that I SAW what the 
creature that Sakura called a Seeker was doing to Lisa. I saw and 
understood on a primal, instinctive level and why not as intense as 
four years ago when we had been caught in Pandora&#39;s gateway the 
sensation was similar. I could hear the scream of torment echoing over 
the Astral Plane and shuddered in cold fear.
	&quot;Leave her alone!&quot; Sakura screamed, jolting me out of my 
petrified state. With reserves and an iron will I had barely known I 
was capable of, I clamped down on the urge to recoil, the instinct to 
flee, freeze up in terror and all the other paralyzing, numbing 
feelings. The other girl needed us now, there was time for all that 
later. Sakura and I barely came two meters before another spiritual 
blow staggered us, nearly driving us to our knees. It was impossible 
to describe but the best picture I could give was of glass shattering. 
That was a weak analogy compared to the real significance but it got 
the meaning across.
	A part of the ancient seal had just been shattered.
	There was a flash of light that caught our attention, even as we 
were trying to advance against the mental onslaught of something vital 
to us being quite literally ripped apart. In a flare of purple-green 
the sprite form of Time emerged without any conscious command from 
Sakura that I was aware of, performing a desperate dive for the 
creature... or better the near lifeless body in its grasp...

******************************

(Lisa)
The setting was quite surreal. I didn&#39;t know where I was but my body 
felt light, ethereal. I had practiced Astral projection before, only 
successful to a degree but enough to make a connection. This was yet a 
little different and actually only a detached part of my mind made the 
connection. The rest was in a state of denial, having been assaulted 
by too much terror in the span of a single moment. Tears ran down my 
face as unrestrained sobs wrecked my body. It had been too much and it 
still wasn&#39;t stopping. The images, the memories blurring. Dark, 
twisted, horrifying. Every negative emotion experienced was merging 
together in one big cauldron bringing unendurable torture. All the 
dark thoughts I had ever harbored about myself or about someone else 
assaulted my very soul in a relentless onslaught while I fell through 
the black void, a tunnel with no end, with seemingly infinite reach... 
and infinite agony...
	I could feel the unfamiliar, cold embrace but didn&#39;t even begin 
to react, just staring blankly ahead into a featureless face of a 
woman with a smile that lacked emotion. &quot;It is alright. Just give me 
what I want and you&#39;ll be free,&quot; the woman whispered, suddenly the 
face overlapped by a myriad of familiar and semi-familiar ones. Family 
members, friends, Kinomoto/the redhead from my dreams, Daidouji/the 
dark-haired woman from my dreams. The agony diminished, slowing down 
with the promise of release right in front of me. All I had to do 
was... was...
	And then, just as suddenly, there was a flash of golden-yellow, 
followed by an annoyed grunt and then a shriek of pain that managed to 
temporally break the spell put on me by the hypnotizing presence of 
the woman combined with the mind-numbing sensations of my darkest 
memories and emotions. I blinked, glancing to the side at the form of 
my best friend and partner, the spiritual body nearly shattered and on 
the verge of distorting...
	Another lance of searing pain bore through me with unbelievable 
force even while my resolve began to harden in the face of my rising 
outrage. I could feel something straining under the onslaught of 
unholy power. That was the funny thing. I&#39;ve experienced a lot of 
things during my travels but this energy felt neither really dead, 
undead nor alive and so I was unable to form an effective mental 
defense before it reached its peak and apparent goal.
	There was the deafening sound of something shattering, followed 
by a laugh so emotionless it was an impossibility in itself. I could 
feel something being torn away from me and smashed but even then my 
assailant didn&#39;t stop continuing to drain me, the overwhelming energy 
filling me, consuming me, attempting to...
	Lina.
	Amelia.
	It was the barest spark at first but when the creature I now 
clearly recognized had smashed my connection to the seal, whatever was 
distorting the images of the memories before failed to do so anymore. 
Which produced a fresh bout of fear, however, with the memories slowly 
coming together, forming a clearer picture, this fear diminished and I 
found the strength to resist.
	Pandora was so shocked at the sudden flare of holy gold 
engulfing me that it took her a few moments to form a response, giving 
me more time to focus my inner mana, tapping into nearly drained 
reserves in a last desperate gamble. There wasn&#39;t enough power left to 
attempt to repair the damage but maybe if I was fast enough...
	The woman snarled in anger and launched an attack so massive and 
powerful it ripped through the hastily erected shield like a knife 
through tissue paper... just to bounce of a barrier of an entirely 
different element.
	I only managed to catch a glimpse at flowing light-green hair 
and a familiar fuku, I only managed to hear an astonished &quot;You!&quot; from 
the creature that had been and obviously was once again our most 
terrible nightmare and then my soul was yanked away from this place...

******************************

(Pluto)
Guardian duty was a lonely thing. No surprise there. I think everyone 
got that point by now. This hadn&#39;t always been the case. There had 
been a time, when the galaxy was younger, when the Senshi had been 
rather new, yes, in this time guard duty wasn&#39;t lonely. Boring maybe, 
but never lonely. There had been someone...
	I tried to shake off the memories, that had been why I came here 
in the first place. Yet even here, or maybe especially here, I could 
not escape the figments of memories, happier, joyful memories. 
Memories of companionship, family... love. Memories of her...
	The revelations from Hotaru had caught me off guard I admit 
that. I wasn&#39;t used to being so... unprepared. I knew for a long time 
now that my sight was blocked when it concerned the rise of Crystal 
Tokyo. I could see beyond it, the many possibilities, the slight 
variations and the greater discrepancies. I also had a pretty good 
idea why that was. Because I would play a major role in constructing 
the future, not just merely assisting, playing my role. It had been 
like this last time and it would be that way now. Didn&#39;t make it any 
less frustrating though.
	The discovery of the trial that awaited us had left me reeling, 
cursing and lamenting about the cruel fate, that we would have to be 
put through this again. The sacrifices last time had been enough. It 
had barely been worth it. The effort, the outcome, everything... In 
the end too many were lost and even more were left behind unhappy. I 
dreaded a repeat, yet as a Time Guardian I could not deny the logic 
behind the nature of the trial... I hated my calling at such points.
	And with the remembering that time, the one time comparable as 
painful as watching the fall of the Silver Millennium, came the 
memories of my old companion, my sister, my lover, my Persephone. 
Apart from those few that had direct memories of this time period no 
one ever remembered her, she was now mostly a memory, reserved for 
myself, and that was okay. Still, my heart yearned for her presence 
now, in the face of the reawakening danger, the revival of an ancient 
struggle that would determine the future fate and very survival of 
creation. I wasn&#39;t sure if I could go through this again, without 
her...
	Persephone had always been there as long as I could remember. We 
were in a sense quite biological sisters, twins even, but there had 
always been a much deeper bond than just that between us. The time 
stream was never meant to be guarded all alone, by a single Senshi. 
From the moment of our &#39;birth&#39; we had done it together. Until that 
fateful moment, until she was taken away from me as just one more 
sacrifice to establish peace...
	&quot;I miss you, Sister,&quot; I whispered, not expecting an answer. I 
was alone here in the mists between time, all alone. Only the gate and 
I. In a way I could almost feel the gate mourning the absence of our 
companion as well.
	I hadn&#39;t been that sentimental in ages, I mused. After the 
events that had eventually lead to the birth of the Silver Millennium 
I had retreated back here, shutting the outside world out and burying 
myself into my duty. It was too painful outside. Everything reminded 
me of what I had lost, of what we all had lost.
	Nowadays I didn&#39;t really need to be at the gate anymore. I had 
once again been associating myself with a specific timeline. That 
happened sometimes in the face of duty. I was linked with the gate 
anyway and if I really needed to return here I could do so in a flash. 
No, right now it was more a solitude, much like last time. Trying to 
hide from the memories. Just like last time, the success was 
blissfully absent.
	My focus suddenly shifted as I registered a disturbance coming 
from the very time period I had currently established a link with. 
Opening myself to the endless pool of possibilities I focused until a 
clearer picture formed. Seeing the present in the time I was linked to 
wasn&#39;t much of a problem, it didn&#39;t give me much of a warning though. 
And thus I let out a stream of choice words that few beings even could 
determine the meaning of. There were two. Two disturbances, of the 
same nature, the same danger...
	&#39;Of course there are two&#39;, I chastened myself for the capital 
oversight. Sure neither of the victims right now had obviously thought 
about it but that was still no excuse. Seekers ALWAYS traveled in 
pairs. How could we have been so stupid? And what was even more 
worrying was that now I could clearly tell that both apparently had 
the dreaded taint of what was labeled a &quot;Soul Thief&quot; in the old days.
	I watched the scenes playing out in front of me, torn inside 
with the decision I had to make. Both could... would need the 
assistance but I only had one to spare. On the one hand my loyalty 
should clearly be with Hotaru and the others, I shouldn&#39;t even 
hesitate. With my very limited sight I could still guess pretty well 
what eventual consequences this might have for Minako&#39;s condition. 
However, there was already enough potential there to handle the 
situation eventually. Especially Sasami... Tsunami actually. Did she 
really think she could fool me that easily? She wasn&#39;t even trying 
really hard. I had watched her from afar after all, as per special 
request from her sister, and was more or less aware of all the 
troubles she had gone through. I hadn&#39;t paid it much mind when I first 
discovered her arriving at Hikawa in her current host, maybe I should 
have been able to make the connection easier. I was usually not one 
who believed in coincidences. Just another oversight...
	And with that knowledge I was reasonably sure she could handle 
the situation. However, it was my adopted daughter who was currently 
in danger here. I really should be there. Both Hotaru and Phoebe had 
been through enough already. If just Persephone would be here, there 
wouldn&#39;t be a problem then...
	Another shift of events drew my attention back to the other 
shrine grounds and if anyone wanted to ever see Sailorpluto stunned 
and at a lack for words here was the golden opportunity.
	I stared transfixed at the semi-translucent form racing towards 
the targeted Seal Child. The hair, the features, everything, that 
was... I couldn&#39;t believe it, didn&#39;t want to believe it. And yet it 
suddenly made so much sense. It was so SIMPLE that I hadn&#39;t even 
thought about it, secure in the fact that I had really lost...
	&quot;Persephone...&quot; I whispered so silently as if fearing the image 
would dissolve into a shred of imagination. The form did vanish, into 
the body of the tortured girl that was, but the brief glimpse I had 
gotten from the aura remained. I could feel her. After so much time I 
could FEEL her again. That...
	Events came to a sudden climax on both ends, disrupting the 
surge of joy and reminding me of the dire situation. I scrunched up my 
face realizing that I had been hesitating much too long and ended up 
not helping anyone in the end. I could feel part of the seal break and 
cringed at the tremor that shook time and space all around me.
	It had begun. Once again.
	With only a last glance at the images, I made a decision and 
vanished from the vast empty plane.

******************************

(Hotaru)
At the moment I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to first think about. Some 
answers had been found today but there were so many new questions. 
Especially concerning HIM. It made sense now that I had spotted 
Xelloss during the unsealing of our memories. I hadn&#39;t been ready to 
believe that alcohol alone could have led to temporal amnesia for us. 
A Senshi, especially my Saturn aspect, was more or less above those 
things, or much more resistant at least. And I definitely did NOT have 
a low tolerance level. I had been suspicious of this fact for a long 
time but now that suspicioion had gotten a face to associate it with.
	Then there were my two lovers. I had found Minako somewhat 
distressed about something but she hadn&#39;t been really talkative and so 
I had settled for silent comfort. It was apparent that the memories 
had affected the blonde more than even I had expected. She kept 
stealing glances at both Makoto and me, but for what reason I could 
not discern as much as I tried. Once in awhile it almost seemed like 
she was going to say something but then apparently thought better of 
it, followed by a morose sigh that was barely visible or audible.
	Makoto was equally silent. Trudging along on Minako&#39;s other side 
the brunette had acquired a faraway look, as if deep in thought about 
a complex problem. Frankly, I expected that to happen. The intensity 
of the night had even caught me off guard. Despite being reasonably 
drugged there was a harmony there that I hardly believed could be 
achieved just by the effect of some powerful... whatever it was HE 
mixed into our drinks. What I saw reminded me so much of Peitho and me 
that the term Star Mating sprang unbidden into my mind and refused to 
go away. Oh sure, there was the lack of a proper ceremony but the 
parallels were just too similar to ignore. The implication was at the 
same time shocking as it was mildly comforting. I had noticed that 
Makoto still acted like I would leave her to have Minako all to myself 
every now and then. If the child wasn&#39;t so much the result of the 
compact&#39;s altered magic but turned out to be an actual Star Child the 
argument would be rendered effectively mute. However, if this was the 
case, then the pregnancy should have been MUCH shorter. It was much 
more likely to assume something in between - if that was even 
possible...
	I was so caught up in my own thoughts that I was almost too late 
to react. With the senses sharpened over more than two hundred 
millennia I avoided the first strike that would have been lethal 
beyond doubt. My fuku formed around me with just a thought but I 
didn&#39;t even have time to react to the immediate danger as my senses 
suddenly flared again, overloaded by the fires of dreadful realization 
from the brief mental flash of something breaking. No, not 
something...
	I was temporally paralyzed, stumbling under a wave of abnormal 
wrongness I hadn&#39;t felt in over two hundred thousand years. My 
connection with the seal wasn&#39;t in the slightest as strong as that of 
the three Seal Children but still potent enough to result in a scream 
of anguish because I knew that very moment that our fate was sealed 
and the confrontation was now impossible to avoid.
	Distracted as I was I had completely forgotten the immediate 
danger and judged by the initial assault that had already come much 
too close to success in my opinion, this proved to be a fatal mistake. 
All I registered was being pushed out the way. The following moments 
were like a tape on slow-motion as I briefly caught a flash of golden 
hair wiping through the air, followed by the image of the beautiful 
face belonging to the hair twisted in agonizing pain.
	An image that would remain frozen in my very soul for a long, 
long time...
	I felt my heart clench, engulfed in an icy iron fist squeezing 
and squeezing and not stopping to squeeze until I was sure it would be 
crushed right there and then, a silent scream bubbling to the surface 
with the force of a volcano erupting after millennia of being 
contained under layers of stone...
	&quot;IIE!!!&quot;

******************************

(Minako)
Everything happened so fast, I didn&#39;t have time to think. And looking 
back on all that followed, maybe that was for the best. Who knows what 
I would have done if I had had time to think. I had been engrossed in 
my own thoughts, reflecting on what Rei had told me. The problem with 
the miko&#39;s words were that they had been like an arrow hitting the 
bulls eye. I knew deep down in my heart that what she had said held 
more than just a margin of truth. The problem was trying to convince 
the rest of myself. I had put up so many barriers over the years that 
it had become next to impossible to listen to the voice of my heart. 
Not that I had become a heartless, cold woman. No, far from it. If it 
concerned others there was hardly a problem. Yet when the problem was 
focused on my own happiness.
	I had arrived at a point - through the persuasive help from my 
two lovers - where I could admit that to myself but the statement in 
turn caused a new conflict of feelings, sending me into yet another 
emotional roller coaster. The main problem was that I wanted to break 
out of that cycle, that I wanted to let those two love me and return 
this amazing and overwhelming loyalty as good as possible. However, 
while my heart yearned for this, it was scared at the same time. 
Scared to mess something up, scared of the possible ramifications for 
my duty and the conflict that could cause, the choice I might have to 
make.
	I didn&#39;t want to choose but Rei seemed to forget that if I let 
myself fall, accepting the feelings that wanted to burst free, then I 
would either end up sacrificing the light of our lives or doom the 
lives of the other two because they&#39;d follow me not wanting to stay 
behind. That&#39;s how it was with Uranus and Neptune, and the depth of 
the feelings from Makoto and Hotaru was surely equal enough to result 
in something similar.
	And that was the main reason why I was scared, scared of their 
love and scared of returning it. I would surely end up hurting them in 
one way or another. Or if not, then I would be the one to end up hurt, 
and I had gone through that too many times already. I wasn&#39;t sure if I 
could bear either possibility...
	And thus caught in the whirlwind of emotions, the conflicting 
extremes wanting to pull me in different directions, I was almost glad 
- in a purely ironic way - to be presented with an alternative choice. 
Had the initial attack been targeted at me I was pretty sure I 
wouldn&#39;t have been fast enough to avoid it. As it was I was astonished 
that Hotaru had evaded the lunge before I even could react to the 
presence of impending danger. I reached out mentally for my crystal 
but hesitated for a brief moment and then totally discarded it as 
Hotaru, Saturn now, staggered an expression of shock and anguish on 
her face. I had no time to even begin to guess whatever had caused the 
reaction. My battle instincts now on full alert I caught the movement 
just in time to act.
	And act I did. As I pointed out initially. If I had time to 
think about my actions, I would have come up with enough reasons to 
hesitate. However, as it was, I acted out of instinct. There was just 
a single thought flashing through my mind and heart alike when I moved 
to push Hotaru out of the way.
	She has to live.
	The reason was simple, year-old barriers failing in the face of 
what was about to follow next. My lips moved silently but no words 
came out. Yet, I hoped that wasn&#39;t necessary. Our gazes locked for a 
timeless moment that was at the same time all too brief. And then I 
felt the piercing sensation, spreading into a wildfire of pain that 
followed a direct path towards my soul. I didn&#39;t know where I took the 
last spark of power, yet somehow I managed to fuel everything I could 
to conjure a hopefully preserving barrier around the seed growing 
inside of me...
	My only regret was that I would probably never see our daughter.
	&#39;Take care of her, Mako-chan, Hotaru-chan... Aishiteru...&#39;
	And then pitch black darkness yanked my soul into a terror 
promising abyss.

******************************

(Sakura)
I had spent a lot of time with my cards, both in this as well as in 
the previous time. Recently a lot of that TIME was concentrated on its 
namesake who had often dropped hints of having more to do with the 
whole situation as she wanted to confess. Seeing as I felt eternally 
indebted to one of the mightiest cards - maybe THE mightiest card - 
ever created, I was not one to question her motives. And yet I 
couldn&#39;t help but wonder, speculate... However, all that didn&#39;t help 
because in the heat of the moment I was thoroughly surprised as the 
card spirit acted entirely on its own. I stood mesmerized for a moment 
because the shape I had confronted before at its resting place, the 
shape that she had assumed countless times before, didn&#39;t match the 
brief glimpse I got of the form now. A bolt of recognition struck me, 
followed by a flaring of hope that maybe not all was lost.
	Sylphiel&#39;s aspect of the seal was definitely broken and it 
pained me to no end that once again I had brought such agony to this 
innocent, kind woman - and that Lisa in the core was every bit like 
her that I could be almost sure of. However, I pushed away the panic, 
self-loathing and other emotions trying to overwhelm me. I slipped 
completely into the mindset of Lina Inverse and waited just for the 
right moment to act.
	The moment came mere moments after Time disappeared in Lisa&#39;s 
soul. The Seeker shook first with tiny tremors and then a mixture of 
golden-white and purple-green raced through the creature&#39;s body as the 
soul nearly separated from the body and damned into infinite agony 
snapped back into place, overloading the creatures senses and 
abilities.
	&quot;FLARE LANCE!&quot;
	Just a moment later Tomoyo followed, a little to my surprise but 
nonetheless a welcomed reaction.
	&quot;ELMEKIA FLAME!&quot;
	Hot linear fire and a whitish-blue spiritual flame crashed into 
the disoriented Seeker, staggering it. Another flash of light signaled 
Time&#39;s reappearance. I was on my knees, catching the pale body that 
wobbled under the sudden transition back into the waking world. Tomoyo 
was right behind me and soon we had Lisa&#39;s form cradled in between us.
	Her eyes were closed and the body alternated between shudders 
and an eerie calmness that had deep concentration written all over it. 
Concern escalated into full-fledged fear as I was dimly aware of Time 
- or what once was Time - engaging the Seeker into combat. For the 
moment I didn&#39;t care, my concentration solely upon the fragile girl 
protectively cradled in between us. I knew what Pandora&#39;s victims were 
put through, what they had to experience. The wound in her abandon 
wasn&#39;t lethal, not physical at least. But the terror the very soul was 
subjected to... I had not experienced it first hand, yet it was enough 
to see the consequences within so many people during the old war. In 
the best cases they were rendered mad, socially useless, eventually 
driven into suicide in one or the other manner. The worst cases you 
don&#39;t even want to know about.
	The fears from earlier came back unbidden, given an all too real 
form. Again I had ended up hurting Sylphiel. But this time it was not 
by giving into impulse and need but by hesitating too long, until it 
was finally too late.
	&#39;It&#39;s not fair&#39;, I screamed in my mind, tears forming in my mind 
as I watched the apparent struggle the girl in our arms had to endure 
in a seemingly vain attempt in keeping her sanity. Why does it always 
need to be her? My vision blurred but my gaze remained fixed on the 
purple-haired girl, desperately waiting, hoping, PRAYING for a 
miracle...

******************************

(Makoto)
As long as I could remember I had been a woman of action. Rather 
throwing myself headfirst into the battle than standing at the 
sidelines, watching helplessly while others got hurt. I didn&#39;t like 
that, I couldn&#39;t STAND it. Bullying, needless violence... I knew that 
some would call me hypocrite with that kind of philosophy and I 
wouldn&#39;t even deny that I got myself into a lot of trouble and some of 
the fights in my youth could surely have been avoided. However, almost 
every time I had had a good reason. Maybe not always sufficiently 
enough but enough for me to act.
	And so the following moments were pure agony because I couldn&#39;t 
do, I DID NOT DO ANYTHING! Like a casual observer, like watching a 
movie drama unfold in front of my eyes I could only watch. The first 
attack had sparked my own instincts but before I even could react to 
that, things were already getting much more problematic.
	&#39;Move!&#39; I screamed in my mind as Hotaru left herself wide open, 
overcome by some mental attack as it seemed. My combat and tactical 
awareness was fully aware of the fact that like this she would make an 
easy target for a second strike and the creature was moving 
unimaginably fast. The only vaguely human-shaped figure that had 
almost given us a run for our money over a month ago had turned barely 
two or three moments after passing its target. And yet I remained 
rooted to the ground, my feet for some insane reason not complying 
with the frantic need all of my other senses were emitting.
	This was so surreal, so, so...
	&#39;Move, damn it!&#39; I almost wailed mentally in frustration. 
Sasami&#39;s words still danced around my mind. &#39;They need you!&#39; I pushed 
through the panic and channeled all the chi I could master, readying 
my very being to meet the attack of the creature with a 
countercharge... But it was too late, I had waited too long. And so 
once again I could only watch in mind-numbing terror, disbelief and 
denial as it was Minako who moved in the last possible moment to 
intercept the projectile-like limb that the creature had extended to 
impale its target. There was a tearing of flesh, a splash of blood 
that once again froze me in place. I could hear my heart pounding and 
the merciless inner scream of failure mixed with the almost constant 
concern having found yet another kind of nourishment. It had been 
Minako who had jumped into the path of the attack. meant for Hotaru, 
while I just stood to the side watching, doing nothing. Nothing! 
NOTHING AT ALL!
	I could only stare, paralyzed to the spot, watching with 
disbelief as these events unfolded too fast for most mortals to even 
comprehend. It was only the anguished scream from Hotaru that snapped 
me out of my trance, even while the full impact of what had just 
transpired threatened to tear my heart apart, echoing the anguish in 
Hotaru&#39;s scream. Instead of succumbing to shock again though, a fury 
unlike I had ever experienced filled my entire being, my 
transformation flowed over me with the distant background sound of a 
massive thunderclap. All my frustration, my inability to act, my guilt 
and my anger sharpened into a single mass of power when I rushed 
forward with a shout of murderous rage...

TBC in Phase Three

Author&#39;s Note

*Maia pops head in*
[Hey, what are you doing in that manhole?]
*dodges several flying objects*
[Yikes! Oh, that is why...]
*flies away at top speed*

*pops head out from manhole and looks around carefully* Is it okay 
now?
Heh, I know you are probably hating me now for that cliffhanger. I 
know because Ay was rather furious after I sent it to her for 
reading...
Now. This was one BIG part. I probably have to divide it on some 
archives! So, after you worked yourself through all this, I&#39;ll make 
the notes as short as possible.

First of all. You probably recognized all of the girls from the entry 
scene to the Jinja in the last segment save for one. If you did, 
points to you. :) If not, I would hardly blame you. Mitsuki is from 
the SNES Tenchi Muyo RPG (probably not the best game ever but oh well, 
I liked the character).
For all of you who have been reading the drafts. The timeline has been 
readjusted (hence the dates for the flashbacks). This time it is to 
ninety-nine percent the one I&#39;ll be using.
Since I have been asked that question on the SiL list. Yes, there IS a 
difference between the Tsunami from Phoebe&#39;s memories and the one you 
probably are thinking about and at the same time there is no 
difference at all. Cryptic, huh? Sorry, that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say at 
this point.
I realize I&#39;ve been pretty rough on Minako. Something along the lines 
of you torture the character you like the most. :) No really, this is 
all part of the story. The Minako I&#39;m writing in this story is not 
easy for me to deal with either since I for one hate to do all that 
stuff to her and often wonder if I&#39;m getting my point across. I have 
been assured I do, so... Next phase she&#39;ll... No, I won&#39;t tell. That 
would spoil the cliffhanger. *goes back into hiding*

This chapter has been uncovering a lot of secrets and a lot of 
background while at the same opening a lot of questions. Of course I 
can&#39;t go now and explain it all, that would be spoiling the story.
I realize that this chapter had a lot of drama/angsty elements and not 
so much on the romance side, that WILL change a little in the next 
phase, the conclusion of the first main story. However, you may keep 
in mind that this is going to be a rather dark series, apocalyptical 
and all that, so don&#39;t expect light hearted fluff all the way through 
to the end. ^_^

With the release of this part I have now made a sub-domain/page for 
the Soul Lights Continuum where in the future all and everything 
concerning this series will be archived. I&#39;m not sure whether or I&#39;m 
going to put the SiL/SA drafts there too, but it IS rather likely. If 
you are enjoying yourself here please step by and visit:

And of course feedback is always wanted, appreciated and craved. :)

Ja ne, yours
