<h1>Mistaken Assumption (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Makoto trudged through her apartment door at 2am, though she wasn&#39;t 
sleepy  her body was tired.  Her chef job in an upscale Tokyo 
restaurant has kept  her on her feet since 6pm.  The politics of the 
hot kitchen, filled with  cooks trying to prepare meals for their 
patrons, would tire anyone out.  Now  that she&#39;s home all her thoughts 
concentrated on one thing: a relaxing bath.     

She made her way to the bathroom leaving a trail of clothes, starting  
with her coat and ending with her panties.  

Makoto hung her legs over the rim of the tub.  At 22 her 6&#39;2&#39;&#39; sinewy 
frame  was a sight to be seen from her lean legs that went on forever, 
to the  beautiful mass of chestnut locks on her head.   As she laid 
among the warm  vanilla scented bubbles she willed her mind to think of 
nothing and enjoy  the quiet serenity of the moment.  Knowing that when 
she returned to work  she&#39;ll long for moment like these.  Though her 
willing was all for naught,  as her mind wondered to her lifestyle.  

All through school she buckled down and concentrated on her cooking.  
She  had had no other choice. She attended the best cooking academy&#39;s 
in Japan  with a tuition to reflect its prestige. She went to school, 
studied, and  slept during the day and worked nights in an all night 
diner.  Contrary to  what people may think it had a lot of business 
because of the hungry dance  club goers next door.  

Makoto did envy the club goers, enjoying themselves on their dates or 
just a  night out with their friends.  Dates and outings were a luxury 
she couldn&#39;t  afford, all her free time was spoken for. She&#39;d put her 
love and social life  on hold to concentrate on her studies.  Her 
academy wasn&#39;t the regular &quot;get  a cooking degree in only months&quot; 
scheme, but a four year school that  provided its students with 
thorough knowledge and techniques for a plethora  of cuisines, and 
occasional internships at an array of reputable   restaurants.  That&#39;s 
how Makoto got her currant job; she made such a  wonderful impression 
while she interned that they kept her when she  graduated.  She thought 
her graduation would bring change to her social  life, after all she&#39;d 
have more free time.  She&#39;d quit her job at the diner  and there was no 
more studying to do.  She&#39;s made a few friends but all seem  to be on a 
superficial level, not like the close friendships she had during  her 
early teens.  

Though, one friend she acquired within the last couple of months seemed 
to  be different, very different.  Azure.  Makoto gave a bittersweet 
smile as  she remembered how Azure came into her life five months ago; 
the day she  graduated from the cooking academy.  Since she didn&#39;t have 
anyone but mere  acquaintances there was no big celebration with 
friends and family for her  to attend, so she went back to her 
apartment.  However, the need to share  her accomplishment drove her to 
the chatroom for recent graduates ages  20-25.  The room wasn&#39;t 
particularly crowed, only about ten people, all  engaged in a boastful 
conversation about their honors and their future  plans.  

As she watched the discourse patiently waiting for a her cue to jump 
in, she  noticed that one member hadn&#39;t said anything since she joined.  
Figuring  that this person was also waiting for the right time to be a 
part of the gab  session Makoto clicked on the nick, Azure, to start a 
private chat.  

Makoto&#39;s smile blossomed as she reflected on how much Azure has come to 
mean  to her over the passed few months.  Only recently had they 
confessed that  their feelings for each other had long passed that of 
just friendship.  It  seemed unreal to Makoto that it happened in the 
first place. From the start  they unwittingly took precautions so it 
wouldn&#39;t happen.  To this day Makoto  doesn&#39;t have any idea of what 
Azure&#39;s real name is or even what she looks  like, all Makoto knew was 
that she attends medical school in Kyoto.  They  never spoke on the 
phone, and yet they somehow fell in love.  Makoto smiled  at the notion 
of how easy it was to fall in love with Azure. How could  anyone not 
love her personality.  She was compassionate, sincere, completely  
amiable, and after Makoto broke through her shell she was funny and  
adorable.  Makoto even loved the way Azure would go off on tangents  
explaining certain miscellanies facts, often they went over her head 
and  Azure apologized once she realized what she was doing, but Makoto 
had come  to love it as a part of Azure she couldn&#39;t do without.  
Makoto couldn&#39;t help  but suspect that Azure was fount on knowledge, 
maybe even a genius like Ami.  

All this thought of Azure made Makoto realize the familiar ache of 
wanting  to be close to her, missing her.  It was about 2:45Am, Makoto 
had no hope of  catching her online, but she had to try. She dried 
water off her drenched body with a large towel while her computer  
booted and automatically signed into instant messenger.  Her heart 
literally  did leaps when she saw Azure&#39;s name there.   

Nature Girl: hey darling, how&#39;s the night treating u?   

Makoto suffered heartache a thousand times over as she waited a few 
minutes  without answer.  As she started typing her goodbye for Azure 
to see later,  an IM finally came.   

Azure: Nat!!  

Azure: I&#39;m so sorry. I was in the kitchen...I&#39;ve been studying since I 
got  home...I can&#39;t remember the last time ate. lol.  

Nature Girl: oh! Well I&#39;m glad u&#39;r here now. what r u having?  

Azure: A few sandwiches. They&#39;re quick to make and you can still do 
other  things while eating, most efficient.   

Makoto cringed at this.   

Nature Girl: Sandwiches? u should come over here, I&#39;ll prepare a proper 
meal  for u....it&#39;ll be quiet tasty too, honest.  

Azure: lol...I don&#39;t doubt your meal will put ambrosia to shame.  

Nature Girl: =-O pretty darn close (*.*)   

Azure stayed quiet for awhile and Makoto assumed she was eating her  
sandwich, so she wrote something.  

Nature Girl: I missed u  

Azure: I know  

Nature Girl: u do?  

Azure: Of course!! Because I missed to you too.   

The butterflies in Makoto&#39;s stomach went wild as she read that, but 
they  only made the ache to be with Azure grow.  Makoto couldn&#39;t help 
it, she  wanted more from this relationship.  More than just a phantom 
love who was  out there, some place where she isn&#39;t.  Her introspection 
was broken by the  blinking on the screen.  

Azure: Nat?  

Azure: you there?  

Nature Girl: yeah  

Azure: :-S you got quiet for awhile, are you tired?  

Nature Girl: just a bit. But that&#39;s not y I was quiet.  

Azure: what&#39;s wrong?  

Nature Girl: I need to c u.   

Azure took a moment to answer, but she did.   

Azure: do you want me to send you a pic?  

Nature Girl: I don&#39;t want the pic. I want u.  

Azure: oh   

&#145;Oh&#39; Makoto sat stunned, staring at the screen &#145;is that all she&#39;s gonna  
say?&#39;  She was a bit too hurt to write a reply, but she didn&#39;t have to 
as  almost a minute later Azure made her own comment.   

Azure: I wanna see you too.  But I have to admit I&#39;m afraid.   

Again Makoto was stunned.  &#145;Afraid!!!&#39; her mind screamed &#145;how could you 
be  afraid of me?&#39;  Her mind skipped back to the days of junior high 
when she  was bounced around from school to school.  Her reputation 
proceeded her  everywhere she went.  No matter what school it was all 
the kids were too  afraid to become her friend, their rejection hurt 
more than Makoto would&#39;ve  admitted.  The pain finally started to eased 
when she found a group of girls  who accepted her for her.  Only now it 
was returning with Azure&#39;s words, how  could someone she love be afraid 
of her?  Makoto came to her senses and  before Azure could write 
another hurtful thing disconnected the instant  messenger. 

She knew it was a cowardly move, but she couldn&#39;t bear to see the words 
she  knew Azure would write next.  

The only thoughts that ran through Makoto&#39;s mind the rest of the night 
were  &#145;how could I have been so wrong? And how am I gonna get over her? 
There&#39;s no  way I can stop loving her.&#39;  Sleep was a deprived luxury 
that night.

Ami sat confused staring at her computer screen.   

MESSAGE:  

Azure: I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t like the &quot;real&quot; me when we meet.
