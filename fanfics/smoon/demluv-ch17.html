  Rei and Usagi made quick work of Mako&#39;s 
exquisite culinary delicacies. Usagi&#39;s massive 
headache from her scrambled brains gradually 
began to dissipate due to the medication Ami had 
given her. She started to feel a little more 
like herself. 
  Rei had begun the clean-up process and asked 
her droopy jinja mate to pull a futon into the 
warm fire room and rest while she took care of a 
few neglected chores. Rei handed Usagi a fresh 
ice pack.
  Rei finished her chores and headed for her 
room&#39;s private bath. She passed Usagi who was 
soundly asleep with the back of her head atop 
the icepack. Rei checked Usagi&#39;s pupil sizes, 
which were normal, and let her sleep.
  She shaved, trimmed her self, and took a 
leisurely shower. Rei put on a royal blue silk 
negligee with bottoms that matched, which made 
her large amethyst eyes look an even deeper 
royal purple, almost like tanzanite. She 
meticulously groomed her hair to its fullest 
luster. 
  When she was satisfied with every personal 
detail, she smelled faintly of warm spices and 
smoke, and looked like the Goddess she was. 
Beats the smell of wyrm dung, she thought wryly.
  Rei went back into the fire room where the 
object of her affections slept. Usagi looked 
exactly as she should have after a work-out. She 
had crashed fully clothed in her rumpled pair of 
shorts and sweaty tank top. Rei sighed, and 
brushed the haphazard bangs from Usagi&#39;s 
forehead then laid a tender kiss there.
  Usagi stirred and drowsily opened her eyes to 
a vision of loveliness. Her breath left her. Rei 
was... stunning. 
  &quot;Rei... you... I... I think I need to go wash 
up!&quot;
  Rei laughed. 
  &quot;Go ahead, you&#39;ll feel like a new woman. I 
need to meditate for a while, so take your time. 
Are you feeling any better, Angel?&quot; Rei asked 
while she tried to feel for the tender area.
  &quot;Hai, much better, thank you. You didn&#39;t think 
a little bump on the noggin would keep me from 
our plans, did you?&quot; Usagi asked and looked as 
shocked as possible.
  &quot;Well, maybe a little. Ok, I was scared, 
happy?&quot; Rei begrudged as Usagi stood to complete 
her mission. 
  Usagi smiled provocatively and left her. She 
decided to use traditional washroom to shave and 
rinse off. She put her hair up and slid into the 
furo&#39;s warm water to soothe away her aches. 
Usagi let her mind wander, but found that she 
could think only of Rei. She felt herself blush 
and decided she should probably get out of the 
public bath water, before she regretted it. She 
padded back over to the shower in the wash room, 
used some floral scented body wash, and 
shampooed her hair. 
  After she dried herself off, she put on a 
white satin and lace negligee with its matched 
bottoms. Usagi brushed her hair out and left it 
down.
  She decided her bond to Rei was worth a little 
extra effort so she gave herself a full-blown 
manicure/pedicure. 
  The ginsuishou glittered brilliantly in her 
cleavage. She found the dark blue velvety box 
that contained the gift Rei had given to her for 
her 18th birthday. In it nestled a slender 
choker and ankle bracelet that consisted of a 
series of tiny round royal indigo sapphires set 
in gold. It also came with a pair of small post 
earrings that matched. 
  She put them on and remembered the promises 
Rei had made to her that day, and realized... 
Rei had kept them.
  Rei had told Usagi ancient Romans considered 
the sapphire to be the birthstone for April and 
Aries. But to Rei, they reminded her of her 
princess&#39; eyes. Sapphires represented truth, 
sincerity, and faithfulness... just like her 
princess. Rei had promised she would be each of 
those qualities to Usagi in return. 
  Usagi was almost positive the jewelry had 
belonged to either her mother or grandmother. 
Rei couldn&#39;t have afforded them. Usagi had 
cried so hard, Rei had thought Usagi wouldn&#39;t 
accept her gift.
  Usagi was finally satisfied with her 
appearance and daubed a small drop of the 
Venusian perfume on the hollow of her neck. It 
smelt of fragrant flowers after a slow rainfall. 
Usagi brushed her hair until it&#39;s sheen 
resembled a bright full moon. She was ready. 
  Usagi took a deep breath and re-entered the 
fire room where Rei wore her Shinto robes and 
knelt in prayer.
  Rei felt Usagi&#39;s presence and smiled secretly. 
She didn&#39;t have to turn around to know Usagi had 
made herself beautiful just for her. 
  But Rei wasn&#39;t quite as prepared as she 
thought she would be for the vision that greeted 
her eyes. Her eyes slowly began their travel 
upward. They started with a lovely pedicure on 
delicate feet, the sapphire bracelet around a 
petite ankle, hard sculpted calves, and... oh 
my. Rei gulped. Usagi had, by far, the most 
beautiful legs she&#39;d ever seen. 
  Rei drew her eyes upward to the tiny waist, 
firm chest, the long slender neck with her 
necklace that caught the firelight, and then she 
took in Usagi&#39;s achingly beautiful face with 
those intense royal blue sapphire eyes. Right 
now, Usagi positively radiated her sex appeal. 
  Rei closed her eyes as her heart fluttered 
wildly in her chest, and smelt her fragrance. 
She tried hard not to hyperventilate and told 
herself, &#39;Rei... breathe in, Rei... breathe 
out.&#39; To prevent giddiness, she opened her eyes 
and met Usagi&#39;s eyes. They twinkled. 
  Usagi held her hands out to invite Rei to 
stand and join her. 
  Rei took Usagi&#39;s hands and stood a little 
unsteadily. The bond was really going to happen! 
  Usagi removed Rei&#39;s Shinto robes, folded them
carefully and set them aside. Then she spoke 
softly.
  &quot;Rei, am I whom completes you?&quot; She asked.
  Rei found her voice at last and answered her. 
  &quot;Hai, Usagi, you are. Usagi, am I whom 
completes you?&quot; 
  Rei asked in kind.
  Usagi answered her beloved. 
  &quot;Hai, Rei, you are. We must now ask a god or 
goddess to preside over, and guide us through 
any vows we wish to share. Which vow is it you 
wish to share with me, Rei?&quot;
  Rei swallowed a lump that rose stubbornly in 
her throat. 
  &quot;I... I wish with all my heart and soul to 
share an eternal blood bond with you... 
Serenity,&quot; Rei almost whispered, &quot;which vow is 
it you wish to share with me?&quot;
  Usagi smiled a little at Rei&#39;s choice of 
names. 
  &quot;I wish with all my being to share an eternal 
blood bond with you... Diana.&quot; 
  Usagi leaned forward and laid a soft butterfly 
kiss upon Rei&#39;s perfect lips. 
  &quot;Since I know my own Mother, I will ask her to 
officiate alongside your Mother. When you meet 
your Mother, you will understand why I want them 
both here.&quot; 
  Usagi removed her hands from Rei&#39;s, and faced 
the fire. She brought her hands close together. 
She willed the ginsuishou forth, closed her 
eyes, and concentrated.
  Rei held her breath and trembled slightly, in 
awe of her partner. She never got tired of the 
ginsuishou&#39;s display of power.
  As before, the fire flared brightly and the 
air shimmered with a light that coalesced into 
two beings. One Rei recognized right away as 
Queen Serenity, but the other looked like a 
mirror image of her own self, almost down to the 
last detail. She fainted.
  Usagi caught Rei and gently lowered her onto 
the floor. She knelt beside her fallen mate and 
held her upper body in her arms. She stroked her 
ebony hair, and spoke soothingly to her. 
  &quot;Rei, it&#39;s all right... wake up, love. Your 
Mother is the Goddess Artemis. I, too, am 
shocked at how much you resemble her.&quot;
  Rei&#39;s eyes fluttered open, aware of Usagi&#39;s 
soft voice and caresses. 
  &quot;Did I just faint? Oh, Usa, I&#39;m sorry... how 
embarrassing!&quot;
  Usagi dimpled and whispered back. 
  &quot;Hai, some bodyguard you are! Now I know you 
are human after all! We need to transform now, 
tough girl.&quot; 
  Rei looked up at her Mother&#39;s immobile visage 
shyly and made a wry face. 
  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I haven&#39;t given you a very good 
first impression, have I?&quot; Rei struggled to her 
knees with Usagi&#39;s help. 
  Usagi stood and used her henshin pen to become 
Eternal Sailor Moon. She stepped towards her 
Mother, and left Rei to face her own mother, 
alone.
  Rei reached for her henshin pen with her right 
hand, and felt air displacement from something 
sharp as it came swiftly towards her exposed 
throat. With her left thumb and index finger, 
Rei stopped the blade inches from its intended 
target. 
  Rei was filled with the fire of Mars, and in 
the twinkle of an eye, Rei transformed not into 
Super Sailor Mars, but into the Goddess Diana. 
  Where Artemis was clad in silver armor 
reminiscent of Galaxia, so Diana was clad in 
metallic red armor which covered thick leather 
trappings that reminded Usagi of the wyrm hides 
Diana had worn on Mars. The armor seemed to glow 
like molten metal in the firelight. 
  Artemis&#39; weapon turned white hot, and the 
goddess dropped it with a loud clatter onto the 
hard floor. Diana glanced over towards Eternal 
Sailor Moon. She had already summoned Exavyre.
  Usagi was deceptively strong, but her true 
strength lay in her swift, deadly, accuracy. Rei 
knew there was no one she knew who existed, 
herself included, that matched Usagi&#39;s lethal 
blade. The addition of Hephaestus&#39; magic sword 
didn&#39;t help matters. A snowball in Hephaestus&#39; 
forge came to mind. 
  Diana&#39;s lips formed the word &#39;no&#39;.
  Artemis silently reached behind her for a 
silver arrow, but found she had a deadly flaming 
arrow already at her own throat. 
  Artemis froze. 
  Diana had risen with feral quickness, her eyes 
were ablaze, and her body radiated heat and 
power. Diana&#39;s lips had moved wordlessly in a 
silent spell and immobilized the Goddess 
Artemis.
  Diana now wore a deadly calm expression upon 
her countenance, her eyes were dark tanzanite, 
terrible to behold in their coldness. She made a 
formidable presence.
  Sailor Moon was terrified, and watched in 
horror as her beloved evolved into someone she 
did not know, and could not remember. This Diana 
only vaguely resembled the young warrior 
princess she had fallen in love with on Mars. 
She had only heard stories of the Goddess Diana, 
prodigy child of Hecate. Exavyre quivered in her 
hand, and her wings trembled. 
  Then Diana spoke for the first time. Diana&#39;s 
quiet voice was slightly deeper than Sailor 
Mars&#39;, though held the same musical qualities. 
  &quot;Mother, I have had you summoned here for a 
peaceful purpose. Yet you dare threaten to kill 
me, unprovoked, and desecrate my holiest of 
places. Your behavior has also caused me to 
frighten my beloved, which I find intolerable. 
There will be no bloodshed here today. I may 
have your blood in my veins, but I have no taste 
for your vindictive nature nor do I desire your 
propensity for murderous bloodlust. 
  I have been born so that I might preserve and 
protect life. I give my allegiance and bow only 
to the Serenities who share my same values.&quot; 
  Diana knelt on one knee and bowed low to Queen 
Serenity and Eternal Sailor Moon. 
  Queen Serenity spoke softly. 
  &quot;Rise Princess Diana of Mars, I am always 
honored by the allegiance of your soul... no 
matter what form it may take. You must find a 
way for peace with your Mother, however, before 
she will grant audience to your request.&quot; 
  Diana nodded, and rose. She de-transformed to 
become Super Sailor Mars, and faced Artemis.
  Mars whispered a counter spell to release her 
Mother. 
  Artemis immediately reached for her sword, but 
Mars&#39; foot was on the hilt. 
  Mars neatly looped her toe through the hilt, 
lifted it slightly and tossed it to Queen 
Serenity who caught it by the hilt. 
  The two Serenities who wielded the broad 
swords made an almost comical combination. 
Almost. Mars shuddered. 
  She faced her determined mother.
  &quot;No. Stand and face the human I have divinely 
become, Mother. I am not a mistake. I have a 
purpose, and my life has meaning. I will not let 
you take it. 
  It is my intention to ask you for my rite of 
passage from maidenhood to womanhood in this, my 
18th year. I do not ask passage through 
matrimony to a man, nor by acceptance into 
Amazonian abstinence, but rather by an eternal 
blood bond oath with my soul mate, the Princess 
Serenity. I ask your permission, as the patron 
Goddess of vows and oaths for youth passage, to 
perform this sacred ceremony. 
  I ask nothing of my Mother. 
  Will you, or will you not give us your 
blessing in this matter?&quot;
  Artemis straightened to behold her only blood 
&#39;offspring&#39;. 
  &quot;Hecate has taught and raised you well. Truly 
you are her daughter, and in deference to my 
love for my lunar sisters, I will ignore your 
impertinence in reference to my character. I 
will allow the blood bond, warrior Diana.&quot; 
  A slow smile spread across the huntress&#39; 
features. She then opened her arms wide to 
invite a confused Mars into them.
  Mars moved warily into a position where she 
would either be struck dead, or be loved, and 
closed her eyes to accept her fate. 
  Then she felt a tender unarmored embrace 
surround her. Mars wept for the first time in 13 
years on the white-robed bosom of her real 
Mother. Mars let all the tears of her hardships 
fall shamelessly onto the shoulder of the one 
person who could truly heal what her mortal 
father had shattered... trust in parental love 
and unconditional acceptance.
  The Serenities waited in humbled quiet wonder, 
while the two powerful women reconciled 
tearfully.
  For the once estranged mother and daughter, it 
was now time to leave behind a childhood neither 
had experienced together.
  Artemis let go of her beautiful daughter and 
smiled at her. 
  &quot;We now begin your rite of passage ceremony.&quot;
