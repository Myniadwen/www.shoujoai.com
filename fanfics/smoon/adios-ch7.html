<h1>Con Su Adios, Usted Toma Con Usted Mi Co (part 7 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Makoto walked out of the hospital, grummbeling. &quot;I don&#39;t believe this. 
I finally get out of this place from the wreck, and a few weeks later 
I&#39;m back in for three more stiches where those damned youma attack 
me.&quot;

Minako sweatdropped. She had been the only one to go with Makoto to 
the docter. The others had to be home after the fight for curfew. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t get attacked this much when we both lived in England,&quot; 
Makoto said walking to her car and climbing into the driver&#39;s side. 
Minako climbed into the passenger&#39;s side.

&quot;How many sticthes does this make total now,&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;Hell, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Makoto grummbeled. &quot;I&#39;ve lost count...&quot;

Minako nodded as Makoto pulled out of the parking lot and into the 
traffic. They were silent for a while. Makoto was taking Minako to 
Rei&#39;s temple for the night. 

&quot;When did you get the tattoo,&#39;Minako asked.

&quot;Nani?&quot; Makoto asked confused. She had zoned out. &quot;Oh, my tat...Uh...A 
year I guess after you di- left.&quot;

Minako nodded. She caught the little change Makoto had made. She knew 
Makoto was about to say &#39;died&#39;. Even now, Minako wasn&#39;t sure why 
Makoto just didn&#39;t hit her for faking her death and leaving. Minako 
wasn&#39;t exatly sure why Makoto had put up with her for so long after 
meeting again.

&quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Makoto said, pulling up to the Temple&#39;s stairs and 
parking. 

Minako blinked and looked out her window. &quot;Oh, hai.&quot; She went to get 
out, but stopped. &quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot; 

&quot;Will you walk me?&quot;

Makoto blinked and nodded. &quot;Sure.&quot; Makoto shut the car off and and 
walked over to Minako&#39;s side and opened the car door for her. Minako 
smiled a little as she and Makoto walked up the temple stairs.

Minutes later, they were at the top of the stairs, making their way 
towards the temple itself. More specifically, Rei&#39;s bedroom.

As they got to the door, an even deeper silence fell over them. 
Breaking the silence, Makoto said, &quot;Thanks for going to the docter 
with me. You didn&#39;t have to.&quot;

&quot;Yea, I know. I just felt like it I guess,&quot;Minako said looking down.

&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Makoto and Minako looked to the side and saw Rei coming 
from the kitchen. &quot;Whats up?&quot;

&quot;Nothing much,&quot;Makoto said. &quot;Just dropping off Minako. I&#39;ll see you 
two later.&quot; Makoto then quickly left.

&quot;Man,&quot; Rei said walking up to Minako. &quot;She&#39;s got it bad.&quot;

Minako nodded then blinked. &quot;Has what bad?&quot;

Rei looked at her shocked. &quot;You don&#39;t know?&quot; Minako shook her head. 
&quot;You haven&#39;t noticed??&quot; Again, Minako shook her head. &quot;You mean to 
tell me you don&#39;t know Makoto has a major crush on you??&quot; Minako 
looked at Rei in shock. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you haven&#39;t noticed. 
Everytime I see her looking at you, she has this far away expression 
in her eyes.&quot;

Minako just stood there. &quot;I...I think you must be reading her wrong.&quot;

&quot;Iie, I&#39;m not,&quot; Rei said, placing a potatoe chip in her mouth and 
chewing it. 

&quot;She loves you.&quot;

My friends say you&#39;re so into me
And that you need me desperately
They say you say we&#39;re so complete

But I need to hear it straight from you
If you want me to believe it&#39;s true
I&#39;ve been waiting for so long it hurts
I wanna hear you say the words, please

Makoto walked down the street, trying to find a store she could go 
into to find something for Mianko&#39;s birthday that was in a few weeks. 
Makoto couldn&#39;t believe it was so cold in October here. Than again, it 
had been years since she had been in Japan.

Makoto walked a while longer, looking inside the large windows of 
different stores, trying to figure out what she should get Minako. 
Makoto had even thought of giving Minako lingerie for her 
birthday...But thought the gift was too personal. Especially given 
their past together.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Came a voice behind Makotot. She turned around and a white cat 
had jumped into her arms. A golden cresent moon on his head. Makoto 
smiled and scratched his head. 

&quot;Hello Artemis...&quot; He purred and smiled. Makoto walked down the 
street, Artemis still in her arms. She made sure the road was clear 
before crossing it, heading over to the park.

Finding a bench, and making sure no one was around, Makoto sat Artemis 
next to her on the bench and smiled. &quot;I was wondering when ol&#39; Arty 
was gonna show up.&quot;

Artemis smiled and chuckled. &quot;Hai. How are things going, Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re going good. I&#39;m gonna have to find a job soon,&quot; she said, 
turning and looking out at the lake. &quot;Mom and dad left me money after 
they died, but it&#39;ll last only so long.&quot;

Artemis nodded and also looked out at the lake. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for what 
Minako did to you.&quot;

&quot;Nani,&quot; akoto said looking at the cat.

&quot;I said I was sorry. You were her closest friend in England and she 
just left.&quot; Artemis looked up Makoto. &quot;You were always on her mind 
after she left and came here. She loves you deeply, but..I don&#39;t 
know.&quot; He looked back out the lake. &quot;She got scared that night after 
the explosian. I don&#39;t know why. Everyone else thouht she was 
dead...maybe she thought you were one of them and didn&#39;t want to scare 
you. But I can&#39;t be sure. She never told me why she never told you.&quot;

&quot;Its alright,&quot;Makoto said, looking back out the lake. Tears were 
forming in her eyes, but she blinked them back. Makoto wanted to know 
why Minako had ran off that night without telling her the truth.

&quot;I miss her tho,&quot; Makoto sighed.

Artemis nodded. &quot;She&#39;s missed you.&quot;

They sat there for a while longer, watching the sunset before Artemis 
jumped down and streched. &quot;I better get home,&quot; he said walking away 
and then turning back to face Makoto. &quot;Makoto...what were you looking 
for while you were window shopping?&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;You know damn well what I was looking for, cat.&quot;

Artemis smiled more. &quot;Then how about trying a get away for two at a 
spa in the mountains? It&#39;ll give you and Minako a chance to catch up 
and to get close again.&quot; With that, he smiled once more before running 
off.

Don&#39;t, don&#39;t let me be the last to know
Don&#39;t hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don&#39;t let me be the last to know

Minako smiled as everyone presented her with her birthday cake. There 
had been a surprise party for Minako a week early of her birthday. 
Just so she wouldn&#39;t guess it was coming.

&quot;Come on Minako,&quot; Usagi said, eyeing the white cake. &quot;Make a wish 
already!&quot; She laughed at Usagi&#39;s face.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;Come on and make a wish birthday girl.&quot; Makoto 
was leaning againstthe door frame behind Minako. Minako eyed her from 
the corner of her eye and smiled, blushing slightly.

Minako thought for a moment before closing her eyes, and blowing out 
her candles. Everyone cheered and Mashou, Minako&#39;s boyfriend, wrapped 
one arm around her waist as he kissed her cheek. His other hand 
presented her with her gift.

&quot;What did you wish for, Mina-chan,&quot; He asked her. Makoto glared at 
him, Minako noticed. Turning back to him, she smiled.

&quot;Nope, I can&#39;t tell you,&quot; She said winking at him. &quot;Won&#39;t come true if 
I do.&quot;

Mashou smiled. &quot;Yea alright. Here,&quot; he siad smiling, holding his gift 
up to her again.

Minako giggled and took the gift from him and opened the small box. 
Inside was the new Sailor Senhi game that had only came out the day 
before. So they were very rare. 

&quot;How did you get a hold of this,&quot;Minako asked. &quot;I went to three 
different stores trying to find it!&quot;

Mashou laughed. &quot;I know. I have a friend who worked at one of the 
stores that caried it. I had to pay him extra to swipe it for me. I 
got it three days ago.&quot;

Minako rolled her eyes and laughed. &quot;You&#39;re too good. Thank you.&quot; He 
winked at her.

The other girls also presented her with gifts from them ;from Rei she 
got a sweater; Usagi she got jewelry; from Ami, a romance novel. 
Minako looked hopefully at Makoto who only smiled.

&quot;Nani? Think I&#39;m gonna buy a gift for a gaki like you??&quot; Minako looked 
hurt for a second before she heard Makoto laugh slightly. &quot;Here you 
baka,&quot; Makoto said, handing Minako a card.

Minako smiled and eagerly took the red envelope and opened it. Inside 
was a pink and white card with a picture of Hello Kitty on the front. 
Minako giggled. That had been her faveorite show when she was little. 
She was surprised Makoto had remebered or even cared to. Hello Kitty 
was dressed in a tutu and the card read on the outside-

&quot;Happy Birthday
&#39;tutu&#39; 
you you!&quot;

Minako giggled more and opened the card, but it was empty. Except for 
a passage in Makoto&#39;s hand writing that said-

&quot;Minako~

&quot;Happy Birthday you baka. I couldn&#39;t afford much, other than this 
card...

&quot;..And something else. I&#39;ll give it to you after the party.

&quot;Lots of,

&quot;Mako-can&quot;

Minako blinked and looked up Makoto who only winked at her. &quot;Ok! I 
want some of that cake!&quot;

After a few hours of having a good time at Rei&#39;s temple, Mashou had to 
say goodbye and go home. He kissed Minako&#39;s cheek and hugged her 
beofre leaving. Makoto glared at him the entire time. Rei giggled 
because of it, proving just how right she was about Makoto.

The girls had planned a slumber party for the night, and somehow they 
were able to convince Makoto to stay as well. Makoto agreed, of 
course, but after seeing Ami&#39;s face, only agreed to stay if she could 
have her own room. Rei agreed.

The five girls sat in Rei&#39;s bed room, laughing at the others antics. 
Ace and Artemis pounced one another, hitting Luna every now and again, 
who would wake up and start chasing them around the room. The girls 
laughed when the boys ran to their girls for protection from the 
cranky feline.

When Makoto noticed everyone getting sleepy, but trying to ignore, she 
yawned and excused herself to leave.

&quot;I think its time we went to bed. Before we fall over and hurt 
ourselves,&quot;Makoto said standing. &quot;Oyasumi nassi, girls. See you in the 
morning.&quot; She then left Rei&#39;s room, sliding the door closed after her.

&#39;I agree,&quot; Rei said, stiffeling a yawn. &quot;I&#39;m tired.&quot; She glared at 
Usagi who would be sharing the bed with her and swaetdroped. &quot;I hate t 
when she drools on my pillows....&quot; 

Rei shut of the lights and everyone laid down to sleep. However Minako 
couldn&#39;t sleep. She waited until she was sure everyone was asleep 
before getting up and leaving the room. She had been so curious to see 
what Makotohad given her and she had yet to see what it was.

She closed the dor behind her, and quietly made her way to Makoto&#39;s 
room. She knocked softly before opening the door to find Maktoo wasn&#39;t 
there. Only Ace who was curled up asleep in the middle of the bed. 

She closed the door, and looked out towards the front of the building, 
and saw a tall, lean shadow leaning against the frame of the building, 
smoking a cigarette. She sighed knowing who it was.

&quot;I thought you had quit that?&quot;

Makoto took a puff before turning her head to see Minako standing next 
to her, still in her pj&#39;s. 

Turning her head to release the cloud of smoke, Makoto answered, &quot;I 
did. For a while.&quot;

&quot;Why did you start back up again,&quot; Minako asked, walking to stand in 
front of Makoto, leaning on the other side of the door frame.

Makotowas still staring out at the yard, deep in thought. &quot;Nerves, I 
guess. Nicotine seems to calm me down. And, unfortunetly, I was hooked 
again.&quot;

Minako sighed and stared out towards the yard too. &quot;I wish you would 
quit that. Youcan die from it.&quot;

&quot;Hai, I know. But I think I wil die sooner hanging around you and your 
friends before I die from taking a few puffs off of a square.&quot; Makoto 
took one last hit before flicking the cigarette out towards the yard.

&quot;Litter bug.&quot;

&quot;Hai I know,&quot; Makoto said, smirking. &quot;Why are you up so late, 
Mina-chan?&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep.&quot; She stood up from the door frame and sat on the 
edge of the walk way, her feet dangeling over the side. Makot went to 
stand next to her. Minako looked up at Makoto who was once again 
looking out at the yard. &quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;The same. I suspect you want your gift, ne?&quot;

Minako giggled slightly and looked back out. &quot;Hai. Only if you want to 
give it to me.&quot;

Makoto glanced down at her and smiled. &quot;Hai.&quot; She reached into her 
leather jacket and pulled out another envelope. this one was long and 
thin, as if it were containing money. &quot;Here,&quot; Makoto said, handing the 
envelope to Minako.

Minako took the white paper and opened it. Inside she found two passes 
for a lodge get away in the mountains. Minako looked at the prices on 
the passes and nearly fainted. Jerking her head up at Makoto, who was 
now leaning against one of the pilliars, and gasped. 

&quot;I can&#39;t belive you bought these passes! They were very 
expensive...&quot;Glancing back down at the passes, Minako added, &quot;And 
they&#39;re royal treatment passes too! Mako-chan...I can&#39;t take 
these...Not after what happened...&quot;

&quot;Hai you can take them,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;And you will. I refuse to take 
them back. Besides, if I did, I wouldn&#39;t be able to cash them to get a 
refund. I bought them a few weeks ago. Its too late to take them 
back.&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan...&quot;

Makoto leaned up from the pillar and removed her coat. She bent down 
and placed it over Minako&#39;s shoulders then kissed her cheek. &quot;Night, 
Mina-chan. Happy Birthday.&quot; Makoto then stood and walked back inside 
the temple, going to her room. 

All Minako could do was sit and stare, clutching the warm jacket 
closer to her cold body.

Your body language says so much
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch
But til&#39; you say the words it&#39;s not enough
C&#39;mon and tell me you&#39;re in love, please

Don&#39;t, don&#39;t let me be the last to know
Don&#39;t hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don&#39;t let me be the last to know

------------------------------------------------------------

The next day, Minako offered to stay and help clean up from the party 
with Rei. Ami and Usagi had to go home to their families, and Makoto 
was still asleep in the extra room.

&quot;So, Mina-chan,&quot; Rei said, picking up a streamer. &quot;I saw you leave 
last night and come back to the room. Where did you go?&quot;

Minako picked up a ballon and popped it, placing it into a trash bag 
of her own. &quot;Outside. I couldn&#39;t sleep.&quot;

Rei glared at her. &quot;In just your pj&#39;s? Minako, it was freezing last 
night. Where did you go?&quot;

&quot;I told you outside.&quot; Minako lowered her head and mummbled something 
and Rei looked at her more.

&quot;Nani??&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan was outside,&quot; Minako said blushing. 

&quot;Ooo,&quot; Rei squealed. She grabbed Minako&#39;s arm and making her sit down 
next to her in the floor. &quot;What happened??&quot;

Minako blinked and blushed. &quot;Nothing happened. We just talked was all. 
And she gave me her gift.&quot;

&quot;What was it,&quot; Rei asked eagerly.

&quot;Two royaltreatment passes to that spa in the mountains.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes bulged from her head. &quot;Two!? One is expensive enough! But 
two!? She spent some major cash on you girl.&quot;

Minako sighed. &quot;Hai I know.&quot; Minako felt very bad for the gift. She 
knew she didn&#39;t deserve such a treat.

&quot;Whats wrong, Minako?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot;

&quot;So, who are you gonna take with you,&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Makoto, I guess. Would be only right, ne? I mean, she bought them for 
me.&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; rei said, standing. &quot;Maybe. I wonder why she&#39;s spending so much 
money on you and you two only met a few months ago. I mean....Despite 
the crush.&quot;

Minako giggled nervously, also standing. &quot;Hai. I wonder.&quot;

Some one yawning made the two girls turn around. Makot stood in the 
door way, her hair touseled, and her clothes wrinkled. &quot;Morning 
girls.&quot;

Minako giggled and Rei smiled. &quot;You mean afternoon.&quot;

Makoto blinked and sweatdropped. &quot;Hai.&quot; Fixing her hair, and tucking 
in her button up plaid shirt, Makoto looked over at Minako. 
&quot;Mina-chan, what did you do with my jacket last night?&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes went wide as if she had been lied to and turned her head to 
Minako and mouthed &#39;Her Jacket?&#39;

Minako blushed and looked over at Makoto. &quot;Its in rei&#39;s bedroom 
Mako-chan.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Makoto then turned and left the room, going to retrieve her 
coat.

&quot;She gave you...her coat??&quot; Rei laughed at Minako&#39;s flushed face. 
&quot;Thats why you weren&#39;t cold last night wasn&#39;t it? And just WHEN did 
you to get so close to start calling each other pet names? When did 
this happen? Where was I?&quot;

Minako shruged and smiled. &quot;Mars?&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes and continued cleaning the room.

I need to hear you say
You love me all the way
And I don&#39;t wanna wait another day
I wanna feel the way you feel
Oh, c&#39;mon

The following weekend found Minako and Makoto at the health spa. Both 
were enjoying themselve very much They had arrived early Friday 
morning, and weren&#39;t planning on leaving till Sunday afternoon.

Friday they spent the day at the hot springs. Relaxing and just 
catching up on old times. And if they weren&#39;t at the hot springs, they 
were out on the lake, in a row boat just relaxing out there. Had 
people seen them floating nearby, they would have thought they were a 
couple. Makoto often had a book she was reading while in the boat, and 
Minako would be laying next to Makoto, her head on her stomache, 
sleeping.

Saturday morning was Minako&#39;s birthday. She was asleep in the King&#39;s 
sized bed, buried deep with in the comforter, warm and cozy. When she 
finally awoke aroun ten, her fuzzy vision was greeted by blurs of red 
and green. Blinking several times and wiping the sleep from her eyes, 
she looked again to see the blurs of color were actually a dozen long 
stem red roses, accented with baby&#39;s breath.

She blinked at the beautiful sie of the roses when she felt the bed 
move next to her and felt two arms wrap around her waist. She could 
feel warm breath next to her ear, followed with a voice she could 
never get out of her head.

&quot;Happy birthday, Minako.&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan...&quot; Minako&#39;s heart beat sped up, and she found she was 
having difficulty speaking. &quot;Naze?&quot;

&quot;Because its your birthday. I had to get you something to give to you 
on your birthday didn&#39;t I?&quot; Makoto tightened her grip slightly, 
pulling Minako closer.

&quot;I-iie. Thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Makoto kissed Minako&#39;s cheek then stood up, letting 
go of Minako. Minako sighed inwardly. She felt very safe in her 
friend&#39;s arms. &quot;Well, lets go for some breakfast, then we can do 
something. Coz...I&#39;m going stir crazy.&quot;

Minako blinked and found her vouice once again. &quot;Hai. Just let me grab 
a quick shower.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Alright. See you when you&#39;re out.&quot; Maktoo then left 
the bed room, closing the door behind her. 

Minako took a few deep breaths, releasing them slowly. She needed to 
know what was going on with Makoto. Did she still have feeling for 
her, or was she just playing with Minako&#39;s feelings for revenge from 
leaving.

Minako sighed and stood from the bed, placing her birthday roses on 
the dresser. Then she went inside the bath room to shower. And to also 
think more about what to do.

Sunday night, Makot drove Minako home from the train station. There 
hadn&#39;t been another moment from Makoto like that of Saturday, although 
there was some exciment. 

The senshi had showed up to deal with a Youma Mamoru had released that 
lived in the lake at the spa. Mitsuakai and Yung Hu had shown up to 
help also. After the battle, Usagi turned the beast back into her 
normal self, and the woman floated up intot he sky before turning into 
a bright star. Mitsuakai and Yung Hu left shortly afterwards, not 
wanting to stick around.

Minako was still somehow convinced Makoto was Mitsuakai. But, she 
wasn&#39;t sure how. And if she was the winged warrior, who was Yung Hu? 
Minako was sure he was someone she knew also, but didn&#39;t know who 
exactly it could be.

&quot;Hey Minako? You awake?&quot;

Minako blinked and looked at Makoto. &quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been telling you for five minutes you&#39;re home, but you seemed 
out of it. i thought you were asleep with your eyes open or 
something.&quot; Makoto smiled.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Minako lowered her head.

&quot;Come on, Minak-. I&#39;ll help you with your bags.&quot; Makoto and Minako 
climbed out Makoto jeep and Makoto unlocked the trunk. Makoto then 
took both of Minako&#39;s bags and carried them to Minako&#39;s apartment 
door. Minako&#39;s aparment was on the fifth floor of a building that was 
located in the posh part of Tokyo.

Minako unlockled the door to her apartment and allowed Makoto in 
first.

&quot;Just sit them down here, Mako-chan. I&#39;ll get them later,&quot; Minako 
said, taking her coat off and placing it on the coat rack that was 
behind the door. 

Makoto sat the bags down by a recliner and looked around Minako&#39;s 
apartment. &quot;You have a nice place, Mina-chan.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Minako said blushing slightly. &quot;You caught my place on a 
clean day.&quot;

Makoto chuckled as she placed her hands into her jean pockets and 
looked at the pictures Minako had on her mantel. There were several of 
her and the girls, one of Artemis and Luna. It looked as if they were 
sitting in someones lap. Judgeing by the two blonde pony tails, Makoto 
knew it was Usagi. There were a couple of Minako and her boyfriend. 
One was a formal picture, taken at Minako&#39;s junior prom. She looked 
beautiful in white. And then there was one of her.

Makoto blinked and and took it off the mantel, trying to get a better 
look of it. It was a photo of her and Minako when they were at the 
orphange. It was the day Makoto had left it for the last time.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you still have this photo sitting out, Mina-chan.&#39; 
Makoto placed it back on the mantel. Minako came out of the kitchen 
with a glass of water.

&quot;Why? Because of the others seeing it?&quot; Makoto nodded. &quot;They never 
notice my photos. Besides, they rarely come to my apartment. We 
usually meet at Rei&#39;s temple.&quot; Minako took a sip of water and blushed. 
&quot;Gomen ne, Mako-chan. I diodn&#39;t even offer-&quot;

&quot;Its alright,&#39; Makoto said laughing. &quot;I&#39;m not thirsty and plus I need 
to get going.&quot; Minako nodded and sat her glass on the counter that 
seperated the living room from the kitchen.

&quot;I&#39;ll walk you to the door.&quot; Minako walked past Makoto and Makoto 
laughed. 

&quot;Afraid I&#39;ll get lost?&quot;

Minako giggled. &quot;Hai.&quot; She opened the door for Makoto, who stepped 
outside of it. Makoto looed down at Minako who blushed and looked 
down. &quot;Thank you for this past weekend. I enjoyed myself.&quot;

Makoto gently cupped Minako&#39;s chin, and lifted her face up so she 
could look into her eyes. &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

Minako blinked as she stared into Makoto&#39;s eyes. That when she 
realised herself she was in love with Makoto. ALways was and knew she 
would always be.

&quot;Makoto...&quot;

Makoto released Minako&#39;s fac and smiled. &quot;Night, Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako blinked and nodded. &quot;Good night.&quot; She then closed the door and 
locked it. Minako leaned against the door and sighed.

Makoto stood outside of the door still, staring at it. She sighed and 
walked away from the door, and left the building. 

Don&#39;t, just let me be the one
Don&#39;t hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
So baby, if you love me
Don&#39;t let me be the last to know </pre>
