&quot;Captain&#39;s log.&quot; a voice states as a starship is seen zooming through 
space, &quot;Stardate... six two eight... point two one. We&#39;ve... come upon 
a... new planet... near... the forbidden zone.&quot;

&quot;Psst.&quot; Ensign first class Tsukino Usagi asked the ship&#39;s Chief Medical 
Officer Meioh Setsuna, &quot;Why does Captain Chiba talk like that? You know, 
like he&#39;s pompously overacting or something?&quot;

&quot;How should I know?&quot; Setsuna asked irritably, &quot;Damn it Tsukino I&#39;m a 
school nurse not an acting coach!&quot;

&quot;Miss Tsukino, Miss Meioh, please.&quot; Chief Science Officer Ami said, &quot;It 
would seem illogical to be carrying on a conversation about a fellow 
Starfleet officer&#39;s acting ability or lack thereof. It also borders 
dangerously close to breaking the fourth wall.&quot;

&quot;You and your infuriating Mizuno logic.&quot; Setsuna growled.

Captain Chiba Mamoru pushed a button on his Captain&#39;s chair, &quot;Tenoh.&quot; he 
said as he reached for a cup of coffee next to him, &quot;We&#39;ve... dis... 
covered a... new planet, I... need... warp eight to... get there... 
within the... next... five... minutes.&quot;

There was silence on the other end for a few seconds, then, &quot;Um... Do I 
have to do this?&quot;

&quot;Ruka...&quot; the Captain asked, &quot;What&#39;s... the... problem?&quot;

&quot;Well, look, imitating an Italian and a Russian are one thing, but a 
Scottish accent? I can&#39;t do it Captain, I can&#39;t do it. My acting 
abilities can&#39;t take much more of this Captain!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s enough... excuses, Ruka! Warp... eight... now!&quot; Mamoru ordered. 
Suddenly the Spaceship hit turbulence, and Captain Chiba spilled his 
coffee on his yellow Captain&#39;s shirt.

&quot;Darn... it.&quot; he murmured angrily, &quot;Ensign Usagi, I... need a... new 
shirt... for when we... reach... this planet.&quot;

Usagi ran to grab the captain a new shirt as science officer Ami arched 
her eyebrow, &quot;Fascinating.&quot; she said in a monotone, &quot;One wouldn&#39;t think 
it possible to encounter turbulence in deep space.&quot;

A short time later, the starship finally arrived at the new planet. 
Captain Chiba and his away team beamed down to the surface, which looked 
to be an Eden-like forest, complete with lush fruit trees and a 
beautiful view overlooking a waterfall. Ensign Usagi was unable to enjoy 
it though, as she began to grow uncomfortable under the Captain&#39;s angry 
glare.

&quot;Captain, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; the blonde said again, &quot;But there were no clean 
yellow Captain&#39;s shirts left in the ship&#39;s laundry room. All they had 
left were red shirts.&quot;

&quot;So you... say, Ensign... but... don&#39;t you... know... what happens... 
to... the guy... in... the red shirt... each week?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Usagi asked, &quot;something bad?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s worse than that.&quot; Setsuna put in, &quot;They end up dead, Usagi.&quot;

&quot;Oh please,&quot; Chief Engineer Haruka said, &quot;I&#39;ve been wearing this red 
shirt since this stupid show started, and I&#39;m still around.&quot;

&quot;Fourth wall.&quot; Ami said as she took out her scanner. &quot;Fascinating.&quot; she 
said, &quot;Captain, it appears we are not alone. Scanners seem to indicate 
there are life forms approaching.&quot;

&quot;I... see.&quot; the captain said as he pulled out his phaser, &quot;Everyone, 
set... phasers... to stun.&quot;

As he gave the order, a beautiful young woman with raven colored hair 
emerged from behind a tree wearing a close-fitting dress. She looked 
almost like an Earthling, except for the large cat ears and feline tail 
swinging behind her.

&quot;Hello.&quot; she said as she held both her hands up in a gesture of 
non-aggression, &quot;Welcome to our planet Felonia. I&#39;m the Prime Minister, 
Hino Rei. Who are you, and why do you come here?&quot;

&quot;We... are with... the Federation.&quot; Mamoru answered, gesticulating 
exaggeratingly with his hands as he continued to horribly overact, 
&quot;We... mean you... no harm. We... simply wish... to explore your... 
planet.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; the Prime Minister said. She then turned behind her, &quot;It&#39;s 
alright.&quot; she called out, &quot;They come in peace.&quot;

At that three more women came out and joined her. &quot;Allow me to introduce 
my Minister of the Arts, Kaioh Michiru, my Minister of Home Economics, 
Kino Makoto, and finally my Minister of Playing with Balls of Yarn, Aino 
Minako.&quot;

All three women bowed as they were introduced. Strangely though, none of 
them bowed to the Captain, but rather to the female members of his away 
team. Chief Science Officer Ami became curious.

&quot;Fascinating.&quot; she said, &quot;Prime Minister Rei, why are there no male 
representatives of your government to welcome us?&quot;

&quot;Male?&quot; Rei asked, &quot;Oh, of course. Well, truth be told, we have no 
males. You see, a plague took away all our men many centuries ago, 
forcing us to come up with new technologies to continue our species. As 
a result we&#39;ve become a planet of all lesbian catgirls.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Chief Engineer Haruka asked as a smile slowly spread across 
her face. As the Minister of the Arts slowly walked toward the 
sandy-blonde officer, Setsuna snorted.

&quot;A plague that took away all the men?&quot; she grumbled, &quot;Oh, come on! 
That&#39;s the oldest shoujo-ai clich&eacute; in the world! I...&quot; her voice drifted 
as Minako boldly approached her. The blonde sniffed at the Chief Medical 
Officer a few times, then smiled as she began to rub up against Setsuna, 
purring happily as she did so.

Captain Chiba Mamoru looked from Haruka to Setsuna, then turned to his 
Chief Science Officer for advice, only to see her being rubbed up 
against by the planet&#39;s Minister of Home Economics.

&quot;Ami!&quot; the Captain demanded, &quot;I want... answers! What&#39;s... happening?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, Captain.&quot; Ami answered, &quot;Although I will say I find the 
sensation of having a catgirl rubbing her breasts up against my back to 
be quite fascinating.&quot;

Captain Chiba was shocked. He was loosing control of the situation, and 
in desperation he turned to his Ensign, &quot;Usagi... we... need to... get 
control of... this situation. I... need your help.&quot;

&quot;Of course captain,&quot; Ensign Usagi answered, &quot;I...&quot; she was cut off as 
she felt something rubbing up against her back. She turned her head to 
see Prime Minister Hino rubbing up against her, her tail entwining 
itself around the blonde&#39;s waist. The Ensign was about to say something, 
but stopped when Rei began to purr. The low, almost hypnotic sound went 
straight through Usagi, and before she knew it she was reaching up a 
tentative hand to scratch behind the raven haired catgirl&#39;s ear, causing 
the Prime Minister to purr a bit louder as she looked sensually at the 
blonde ensign.

&quot;Oh... no!&quot; the Captain groaned, &quot;Usagi, not... you too!&quot; he cried as a 
sound came from out of the forest. The catgirls suddenly looked scared 
as they cowered fearfully behind the Starfleet Officers. Ami quickly 
took a scanner reading.

&quot;It&#39;s life, Mamoru, but not as we know it.&quot; she explained as a rock 
monster appeared from the forest.

&quot;Youma.&quot; the Prime Minister and her fellow catgirls said fearfully. 
Captain Mamoru stepped bravely forward.

&quot;Don&#39;t... worry.&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll give it... the same... speech... I 
always... give.&quot; he then walked up to the monster, &quot;We... are with... 
the Federation, We... mean you... no harm. We...&quot; Captain Chiba was cut 
off as the rock youma picked him up, bit his head off, and tossed the 
rest of his body over the waterfall.

&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Chief Engineer Tenoh exclaimed.

&quot;We should&#39;ve warned your Captain that the youma hates overacting.&quot; the 
Minister for Playing with Balls of Yarn said as she hid behind Chief 
Medical Officer Setsuna.

Ensign Usagi then stepped forward, taking command of the situation as 
she aimed her phaser, &quot;Quick,&quot; she ordered, &quot;Set phasers on kill!&quot; she 
then blasted the youma, knocking it back. The other Officers hit it as 
well, blasting it to bits as it was finally defeated.

The Starfleet Officers then found themselves each being hugged by one of 
the grateful catgirls.

&quot;You saved us.&quot; Prime Minister Hino said just before she gratefully 
kissed Usagi on the lips. As the ensign wrapped her arms around the 
beautiful catgirl and pulled her into a deeper kiss, Chief Medical 
Officer Setsuna turned to Chief Engineer Haruka.

&quot;Ruka.&quot; she said as Minako continued to rub up against her purring, &quot;We 
have to fight it. We have to report back to the ship.&quot;

Haruka pulled her lips temporarily away from Michiru&#39;s, &quot;Setsuna, I 
can&#39;t do it!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;My libido can&#39;t take much more of this!&quot;

&quot;Setsuna.&quot; Chief Science Officer Ami added as she pulled away from 
Makoto&#39;s mouth, &quot;They&#39;re horny. It would seem illogical not to take 
advantage of the situation.&quot;

Setsuna sighed, &quot;Very well.&quot; she said, &quot;Hell, after a week or two the 
ship&#39;ll probably figure out something&#39;s happened and leave anyways.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear you say that.&quot; Minako purred happily as the other 
Officers went off with their new partners, &quot;What&#39;s say we go to my 
dwelling and...&quot; she began to whisper in Setsuna&#39;s ear. Suddenly, the 
Chief Medical Officer&#39;s face began to blush.

&quot;Damn it Minako, I&#39;m a School Nurse not a contortionist!&quot; she exclaimed, 
&quot;But... I suppose I could give it a try.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Minako said as she took Setsuna&#39;s arm and began to pull 
her, &quot;My dwelling is this way. And afterwards, I have a big red ball of 
yarn we can play with.&quot; she added as they disappeared into the forest.</pre>
