<h1>Memories (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/coconut.html">The Coconut Cyclone</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/memories2-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>I park my dark green blazer at the end of the Outers&#146; winding drive. I 
figure that Setsuna would be less likely to open the door if she saw 
my car from one of the windows. So I&#146;m leaving it down here. I slowly 
make my way towards the massive house. The cool night air ruffles my 
bangs as the wind blows lightly across my path. Glancing at the sky I 
send a silent prayer towards my guardian planet. Please let her hear 
me out.

Faster than I thought I would, I reach the front door. I raise my hand 
to knock and then lower it. Can I do this? Will she even listen to me? 
What if she does and then tells me no? I don&#146;t think I could take a 
flat out rejection. I&#146;ve had too many of those already, and they 
weren&#146;t even from people that meant half of what she means to me. 

I ball my hands into fists. Enough of this. I&#146;ll never know unless I 
ask her, and I can&#146;t ask her until I get her to talk to me, which 
means I have to knock on the door. Once again I raise my hand and this 
time I knock. It takes a few moments but I soon hear soft footsteps 
approaching the door. I whisper one more prayer and steady myself.

She opens the door and then just stands there like she&#146;s been 
expecting me. Well, she probably was. Time is her specialty after all. 

I motion towards the door. &quot;Can I come in?&quot; She nods in response and 
steps aside so that I can enter. 

After she closes the door she leads me into the study. I sit down on 
one of the room&#146;s large couches. She remains standing by the door. 
&quot;Would you like some tea?&quot; She asks, her voice flat.

&quot;No, I&#146;m fine.&quot; I take a deep breath. Here goes. &quot;Listen, Setsuna, we 
need to talk.&quot; 

She looks at the floor. &quot;I suppose we do.&quot;

&quot;Why have you been avoiding me?&quot;

&quot;You know the answer to that.&quot;

I raise an eyebrow at that answer. &quot;No, I don&#146;t. All I know is that 
you used to love me, at least a part of me, and now you won&#146;t even 
look at me anymore.&quot;

&quot;How can I?&#146;

&quot;It&#146;s fairly simple Setsuna, you look up, open your eyes, and then 
point them in my general direction. Or is it that I&#146;m not good enough 
for you?&quot;

She looks up at that statement. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I get it, things were fine when I was a princess but now that I&#146;m 
just a solider I&#146;m not good enough for the great Sailor Pluto.&quot;

She shakes her head. &quot;That&#146;s not it at all. Princess or pauper it 
doesn&#146;t matter to me.&quot;

&quot;Then what is it then?&quot; 

She closes her eyes and sighs. &quot;How can I look at you when I don&#146;t 
know if you actually feel the way you say you do?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Now I&#146;m confused.

&quot;Do you truly love me, or is this just what you see as a proper 
reaction to the dreams? Are you doing this out of pity?&quot; She opens her 
eyes and turns toward me. &quot;If that&#146;s the case then save it. I&#146;ve been 
alone for quite some time and I can manage quite well.&quot;

I rise from my seat. &quot;No, I don&#146;t&quot;

She bows her head. &quot;I thought so&#133;&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t pity you. And I&#146;m not doing this just because of the dreams. 
Yeah, the memories awoke these feelings in me, but they were already 
there.&quot;

&quot;How can you be sure?&quot;

I walk over to her and grab her arm. Her eyes widen but she doesn&#146;t 
pull away. &quot;I love you damn it. I don&#146;t know how else to say it.&quot;

She shakes her head. I&#146;m running out of options here. Time for 
something drastic. I take my free hand and gently tip her face up. &quot;I 
love you.&quot; I whisper just before I claim her lips.

It takes a moment but then she begins to kiss me back. I let go of her 
arm and wrap my arms around her waist drawing her closer. Her arms 
wind their way around my neck. It&#146;s much better in real life that it 
is in memory. Far too soon for my tastes, however, we separate.

Her crimson eyes are swimming with tears that she&#146;s struggling to hold 
at bay. &quot;I want to believe you, gods I do. I just don&#146;t know.&quot; She 
whispers as a treacherous tear slides down her face.

I sigh. I almost had her for a minute there. I take her face in my 
hands and brush the tear away with my thumb. &quot;I&#146;ve done all I can. 
It&#146;s up to you now. You know where I&#146;ll be when you find your answer.&quot; 
I allow myself one last whisper of a kiss and then I let her go.

&quot;I do love you Setsuna, all you need to do to see it is open your 
eyes&#133;&quot;
