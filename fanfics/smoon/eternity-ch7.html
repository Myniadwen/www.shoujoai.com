<a href="../smoon/eternity-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Haruka.&quot; The seven-months pregnant Michiru had finally located her mate 
out in the garage. Haruka didn&#39;t look up from tightening a bolt on her 
current project.

&quot;Hai,&quot; she grunted.

&quot;None of my shoes fit,&quot; the violinist stated succinctly.

&quot;None of your . . . shoes fit,&quot; Haruka repeated slowly, her full 
attention not on the problem. Absently, she glanced over toward her wife 
and noticed the brown loafers on Michiru&#39;s feet. They were completely 
wrong for the cream turtleneck and brown faux suede maternity skirt she 
wore.

&quot;You didn&#39;t want a pair of my heels?&quot; the blonde inquired as she wiped 
her sweaty brow with her coverall sleeve.

Michiru had the grace to blush. &quot;These were more comfortable.&quot; She 
wiggled her feet. &quot;But they&#39;re still a half size too big.&quot;

&quot;Wait a while and maybe they&#39;ll fit,&quot; Haruka teased.

Michiru made a face and then held out her hand.

&quot;Shoes.&quot;

&quot;Shoes?&quot; Haruka asked impishly.

&quot;Now.&quot; Michiru&#39;s eyes were bright but playfully serious.

&quot;Now,&quot; Haruka parroted, reaching into her pocket and tossing the car 
keys to her wife.

Michiru smiled brightly and turned to go. As she turned, her rounded 
form was illuminated by the afternoon sun. Haruka felt a surge of 
protectiveness.

&quot;Michiru?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Be careful.&quot; Her teal eyes were serious. Haruka rolled to her feet. &quot;On 
second thought, I&#39;ll go with you.&quot;

Michiru looked tenderly at her for a moment. &quot;Haruka, you don&#39;t have to 
do that. This may take a while.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Haruka sighed in a resigned voice. &quot;Trust me. I know.&quot; Their 
hands slipped together as they walked toward the car.

Two weeks later, it was time to start Lamaze class. Finding themselves 
in a room with several young couples, a single woman and her mother, and 
one set of middle-aged, first time parents was an interesting 
experience.

As they left for the evening, Haruka opened the car door for her 
pregnant mate and wrapped her arm around Michiru&#39;s waist to help her 
ease into the seat. The violinist was looking through the book their 
instructor had handed out, but there wasn&#39;t much she hadn&#39;t already 
researched on her own.

&quot;I was thinking of getting the carpets steamed before the baby is born,&quot; 
Michiru said thoughtfully when they were on their way home.

&quot;Do you want me to hire someone?&quot;

&quot;Or we could do it ourselves. I found a stain in the front room. I want 
to try a different carpet cleaner.&quot;

Haruka made a disapproving sound. &quot;I think you do too much around the 
house as it is.&quot;

&quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;We can get people to come in and take care of the carpets and you could 
do. . . other things.&quot;

&quot;Other things? Like what?&quot;

&quot;Like . . . sit . . . and sleep.&quot; Haruka kept her eyes on the road.

Michiru looked at her wife for a moment in shock. &quot;Haruka, I&#39;m not made 
of glass!&quot;

The look on the blonde&#39;s face showed that she was not wholly convinced 
of that fact.

&quot;Mothers who stay busy have easier deliveries.&quot; Michiru tapped the book 
in her lap authoritatively.

&quot;You&#39;re starting that Pilates class next week,&quot; the blonde reminded her. 
Haruka was all for low impact exercise for her wife. The issue wasn&#39;t 
settled, but the discussion had reached a stalemate. They finished their 
drive discussing car seats.

Michiru combed her hair, enjoying the extra weight and shine it had 
gained during her pregnancy. Her wife came in without a shirt to brush 
her own teeth. The violinist was checking her reflection when Haruka 
stroked some aqua strands back and kissed her neck before wrapping her 
arms around the artist from behind. Her tapered fingers rested over 
Michiru&#39;s arched belly, then slid up to cup her breasts. The smaller 
woman sighed contentedly as the firm touch slowly massaged her. Michiru 
turned slightly and their lips met. The two partners sighed as desire 
spiked.

Haruka moved to pick up her wife.

&quot;No! Stop!&quot;

The blonde froze. &quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll put your back out!&quot; The violinist scolded her, taking a step 
away from her amorous mate.

Haruka laughed and scooped the smaller woman off the ground, baby and 
all.

&quot;Like a feather,&quot; she teased.

Michiru huffed but twined her arms around her beloved&#39;s neck, feeling 
feminine and desirable. She made good use of her current position by 
tenderly kissing her wife. For her part, Haruka was grateful the walk to 
the bed was a short one because there were twelve extra pounds to 
Michiru that hadn&#39;t been there the last time she had done this.

They smiled at each other as the blonde gently undressed Michiru before 
making slow love to her. After Michiru had returned the favor, they both 
fell into a contented sleep.

The following week&#39;s class began with a review of their breathing 
exercises. Michiru lay back against her wife&#39;s chest for the main 
lesson, a video showing an entire natural childbirth. The full on shot 
of the baby&#39;s head emerging from its mother caused Haruka to look away. 
Michiru lightly stroked her arm.

&quot;I had no idea you were so squeamish.&quot; The violinist&#39;s whispered voice 
was amused.

The blonde swallowed hard but didn&#39;t comment. Her fingers idly stroked 
Michiru&#39;s side, drawing comfort from the warmth.

In Japan, mothers had often gone away to stay with their parents and 
returned home when the baby was old enough to travel. While part of 
Haruka wished that this tradition had survived, she would be there for 
her partner no matter what. Being a racer, she had spent enough time in 
hospitals. The thought of Michiru in pain and all alone in some cold 
medical facility was unacceptable to her. After the video, the Lamaze 
teacher was wise enough to distract the shell-shocked couples with some 
minor child care instruction. Although the actual birthing process was 
new to them, baby care was second nature. Haruka expertly demonstrated 
how to change a diaper to praise from the instructor. Several fathers 
looked on enviously.

They left in silence after the class was dismissed. There was no idle 
chatting this evening. Haruka thought about how close the impending 
birth was. They had conceived her only a few months ago. She had grown 
so much, so had Michiru for that matter, not that the blonde was 
concerned about such things.

The baby now responded to light and sound. Haruka was amazed. This was 
one element they had missed with Hotaru. When Michiru practiced with her 
violin, she said that she could feel the child becoming active and shift 
position in her womb. She had read that infants could recognize pieces 
of music they were introduced to before they were born, so she composed 
a lullaby for her unborn daughter. Haruka was inspired by her efforts. 
One night they cuddled together on the piano bench while Haruka played 
softly and serenaded her wife and daughter by candlelight.

The next trip to Lamaze class was more eventful.

&quot;So that your parental partner can better understand what it feels like 
to be pregnant, we have this lovely garment.&quot; She pulled out a spandex 
suit complete with fake breasts.

&quot;You put warm water into this cavity to simulate the amniotic fluid.&quot; 
The woman showed where to fill it. &quot;Inside are lead balls to simulate 
the baby&#39;s limbs and movement.&quot;

&quot;I have this list of simple tasks for you to perform at home so you can 
get a feel for what it might be like to be in a state of advanced 
pregnancy. All I ask is that you sign them out.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go, Michiru.&quot; Haruka started toward the door.

The violinist didn&#39;t move. &quot;You aren&#39;t taking one of those?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re serious?&quot; Haruka&#39;s eyebrows went up.

She signed out one of the suits and was given a paper full of tasks to 
perform while wearing it. She was casual about it, but inside there was 
a nettling curiosity that she wouldn&#39;t have admitted under pain of 
death.

Haruka casually tossed the empathy belly in the trunk. Michiru gave her 
a look.

&quot;The paper says I can&#39;t wear it while driving,&quot; the blonde informed her 
mate.

They drove to the local bike shop so Haruka could pick up a few things, 
then on to the mall to get a few things for Hotaru&#39;s next care package. 
The baby was wide-awake today. Michiru&#39;s stomach was moving around under 
her shirt.

&quot;Ah!&quot; The violinist jumped. Haruka looked at her concerned. &quot;I&#39;m fine. 
It just tickles sometimes.&quot; The violinist put her hands on her back and 
stretched a bit.

An elderly woman approached the couple and put her hand lightly on 
Michiru&#39;s belly. The child was still for a moment before kicking.

&quot;Oh my.&quot; The lady smiled. &quot;What are you having?&quot;

&quot;A girl.&quot; Michiru beamed and rubbed her tummy, delighted with the 
attention.

Haruka was quiet, scowling slightly at what she interpreted as an 
assault on Michiru&#39;s personal space.

&quot;Congratulations.&quot; The woman gave a final pat to the artist&#39;s stomach 
and toddled off. Haruka&#39;s arm slid possessively around Michiru to ward 
off any more unwelcome visitors.

The next day after breakfast and a little work in the garage, Haruka put 
on her pregnancy suit and attached the bladder weight.

&quot;Ugh.&quot; Almost immediately the warm water with which she had filled it 
made her own body temperature rise. With a resigned sigh she went to get 
a drink of water.

Michiru was hiding a smile behind a teacup as Haruka waddled into the 
kitchen.

&quot;Well, how do I look?&quot;

&quot;Kawaii!&quot;

&quot;Kowaii? That&#39;s what I thought too.&quot;

&quot;No, you don&#39;t look scary, Haruka.&quot; Michiru gave a small laugh. &quot;How do 
you like it so far?&quot; She set her cup down and watched her wife with 
bright eyes.

Haruka looked down and cupped the large weighted breasts.

&quot;These are different.&quot;

&quot;Hai. They don&#39;t suit you.&quot; The violinist wrinkled her nose.

&quot;No?&quot; Haruka thrust her chest out. The effect was unfortunate.

&quot;Let&#39;s go for ice cream,&quot; Michiru suggested brightly.

Already Haruka was sweating from the warmth and thirty five extra pounds 
of weight she was carrying. Ice cream sounded really good right now. She 
started to unfasten her suit.

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding right?&quot; Haruka responded questioningly. &quot;I&#39;m not going 
out of the house like this.&quot;

&quot;Come here.&quot; Michiru dragged her wife to her closet. Michiru pulled out 
a flowing white maternity shirt and a pair of capris.

&quot;You are having way too much fun with this,&quot; the blonde observed

&quot;Hai,&quot; Michiru admitted unrepentantly, handing over the clothing.

Thirty minutes later they were out the door.

&quot;How come you can drive, but I can&#39;t?&quot; Haruka groused as she lowered 
herself into the passenger&#39;s seat.

&quot;Ah, you are learning the benefits of natural versus synthetic.&quot; Michiru 
expertly shifted gears and peeled out of the driveway.

&quot;Oi!&quot; The blonde hung on for dear life.

When Haruka walked into the ice cream parlor, it seemed as if everyone 
was suddenly looking in her direction. This was not a new experience for 
her. However, this time they weren&#39;t staring at her face; they were 
looking at her stomach.

&quot;Two scoops for the lady.&quot;

Haruka shook her head. &quot;I only need one.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re eating for two now!&quot; the large woman behind the counter boomed.

Haruka blinked. Because of her athleticism and Michiru&#39;s nutrition 
consciousness, she knew a lot about healthy eating. She might choose to 
ignore it on occasion, but two huge scoops of ice cream weren&#39;t the best 
thing for a pregnant woman. There was a soft stirring of a breeze and 
her wife appeared beside her. Michiru ordered a sorbet in a cup. She and 
Haruka took a table together. On the way over Haruka rolled the top 
scoop from her cone into the garbage.

&quot;They only gave you one.&quot;

&quot;I guess the novelty had worn off.&quot; Her blue eyes twinkled.

Haruka was quiet for a moment licking her cone.

&quot;Do they always do that?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Stare&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;Nani? It&#39;s rude!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re curious Haruka.&quot;

The blonde was quiet as they finished their snack.

After they arrived back home it was time for yet another bathroom break 
- Haruka&#39;s third since puttinng on the suit. When she came back into the 
living room, Michiru was waiting with the paper from class.

&quot;Tie a shoe.&quot; Haruka read.

The process was much more difficult than it had been just that morning. 
She grunted as she strained to reach her feet.

She completed the exercise, but it drained her. She&#39;d been in the suit 
for three and one half hours now.

&quot;I want to take your picture later.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; The blonde huffed as she sat down on the edge of the 
couch to catch her breath.

&quot;Please.&quot; Michiru pouted her lips and looked up with adorable wide eyes.

&quot;What do you want it for?&quot; Haruka asked suspiciously.

&quot;Well, Setsuna&#39;s birthday is just around the corner really . . . &quot;

&quot;Ut uh. No way.&quot;

In the end the Haruka submitted to a few pictures, so that Michiru could 
paint her portrait later and confuse their successive generations to no 
end.

Later that afternoon, Haruka wearily pulled off the suit and all of her 
clothes and flopped on the bed in all her glory. When Michiru came in, 
she found her nude wife curled up against the artist&#39;s pillow. The house 
had cooled and fine gooseflesh dotted Haruka&#39;s side. Michiru gently 
covered up her sleeping mate and stroked her golden hair.

Haruka stretched suddenly, mumbling softly in her sleep.

&quot;Haruka?&quot; Michiru watched her wife&#39;s face.

Teal eyes opened, blinking slowly.

&quot;Are you hungry?&quot; the artist ventured.

The blonde&#39;s eyes slid closed. &quot;I&#39;m awake.&quot; She sighed, her voice 
trailing off as she slipped back into her dreams.

Michiru giggled &quot;I&#39;ll see you at breakfast then, sleepy head.&quot;

A week later, Haruka pushed the door open and let Michiru inside. They 
were both laden with bags of items from Michiru&#39;s baby shower.

&quot;I had no idea we&#39;d get so much stuff.&quot; Haruka again surveyed the 
assorted items. There had been many more people there than they had 
expected, but the shower itself had been lovely.

Makoto and Minako had outdone themselves. There had been tons of food. 
Tiny cakes with icing baby booties on them in pastel shades as well as 
assorted teacakes shaped like rattles.

Haruka had been handed a hefty box full of leftover goodies to take home 
with them. Once that was placed in the kitchen, the couple went upstairs 
into the nursery to put away the layette items that wouldn&#39;t require 
washing.

Michiru began to unpack her gifts and a small soft rattle toy dropped on 
the floor. Haruka knelt to get it. The mother-to-be had been given 
spoons that changed color if the baby&#39;s food was too hot, a faucet 
cover, a floating tub thermometer shaped like a seal, and one of the 
softest baby blankets either of them had ever seen. It was chenille on 
one side and velvet on the other with satin binding. Once Michiru had 
unwrapped the plush receiving blanket, it had become Haruka&#39;s favorite 
plaything.

&quot;Are you going to keep that for yourself and force me to order another 
one for our daughter?&quot; Michiru chided as she pulled out a pink diaper 
caddy with little bears on it.

&quot;It really makes a great pillow.&quot; Haruka was now laying on the floor and 
had the blanket folded into a little square and tucked behind her head.

Michiru gingerly stepped over her lover&#39;s long legs as she put away 
several unopened layettes. Kazuko certainly had enough clothes. If 
Michiru didn&#39;t need them, she would donate them to someone who did. 
Haruka finally handed up the toy that Michiru had dropped.

The days seemed to fly by. Michiru had attained a nicely rounded form. 
Kazuko was developing well. They were amazed at how much personality she 
had. She was starting to play simple games now. She would push her foot 
hard against Michiru&#39;s stomach at night when she was snuggled against 
Haruka. The blonde would lightly run her fingers over the spot and the 
little lump would disappear, only to reappear a few seconds later. 
Unfortunately for Michiru, the baby seemed to wait all day for her 
playtime with Papa and was most active at night. Sleep was not easily 
had by anyone.

Haruka woke up to see Michiru sitting up beside her in bed.

She rolled on her side. &quot;Can&#39;t sleep?&quot; she asked reaching out for 
Michiru&#39;s arm.

&quot;I had a dream,&quot; her wife whispered into the darkness.

A chill went through Haruka and she sat up. &quot;A threat?&quot; she stammered, 
her adrenaline kicking in. &#145;Kami-sama, not now!&#39;

&quot;Oh, no, Haruka. It was about the baby.&quot; Michiru was smiling and her 
voice was a little dreamy and distant. &quot;I dreamed I saw her and that she 
was happy.&quot;

Haruka lay back, to get over the shock to her system. Michiru was very 
intuitive to the point of having a sixth sense. She often had dreams 
about things that would happen or that gave them insight into things 
that had already come to pass.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to scare you,&quot; Michiru said ruefully reaching out to 
stroke her mate&#39;s cheek.

&quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot; The blonde pulled her wife back down on the bed and 
Michiru rolled on her side.

&quot;I want her to be happy.&quot; Her soft mezzo voice was full of emotion.

&quot;I know. So do I.&quot; Haruka kissed Michiru&#39;s forehead. &quot;She&#39;ll be much 
happier if you try to get some sleep while she&#39;s being quiet.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; Michiru yawned and lay back down. Seconds later her eyes shot 
wide open. &quot;Oh!&quot;

The blonde, who had been watching over her mate, started too. &quot;Nani&quot;

Michiru took her wife&#39;s hand and placed it on her stomach where Haruka 
could feel tiny jerks at regular intervals.

Michiru sighed forlornly. &quot;She has the hiccups.&quot;

The blonde rolled over, turned on the light, and sat on the edge of the 
bed with her head in her hands, rubbing her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ll go make some tea.&quot; She sighed.

After two cups of decaf tea, Kazuko was still hiccuping and Michiru lay 
with her head on the table like a wilted flower. She was exhausted. 
Haruka noted the purple circles under her wife&#39;s eyes with concern.

The blonde didn&#39;t feel so good herself. Michiru had skipped her 
afternoon nap because she had been asked to play at an art reception, 
and now she was paying the price.

&quot;Come on.&quot; Haruka helped Michiru up from the table and led her into 
their bathroom. She pulled off Michiru&#39;s nightgown and her own pajamas 
and tossed them back into the bedroom. The whole time her mate stood 
docilely clutching her stomach, too tired to fully comprehend what was 
happening.

When the water was warm enough, Haruka pulled Michiru into the shower 
with her and held her close while the soothing warmth poured down on 
them. She could tell Michiru was lightly dozing against her shoulder. 
She reached around and gently massaged the artist&#39;s lower back. After 
five minutes, it felt so peaceful that it took her a moment to realize 
that her child was also quiet. Pleased with herself, she dried Michiru 
and herself. They crawled into bed not even bothering putting on their 
nightclothes.

&quot;It&#39;s time for bed and this means you too,&quot; the blonde whispered as she 
kissed Michiru&#39;s belly.

&quot;Haruka?&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice was very soft as she reached for the blonde 
and they curled together.

They awoke the next morning only thirty minutes before Michiru&#39;s 
doctor&#39;s appointment and were fifteen minutes late.

&quot;I hate to let you go too much longer,&quot; the doctor said as she skimmed 
her trained hands over Michiru&#39;s distended belly only to be kicked for 
her efforts. &quot;Seems like a very stubborn baby you have there.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s eyes lighted on Haruka. &quot;That makes sense.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s eye brow twitched.

The doctor laughed at the subtle exchange. It was a delight to see a 
couple so attuned to each other.

&quot;Let&#39;s wait a while longer and see if nature will take it&#39;s course. The 
baby&#39;s in a very good position for natural delivery.&quot; The doctor 
stripped off her gloves and made notes in her chart. &quot;She&#39;s also a small 
baby and I&#39;m happy about that.&quot;

&quot;How much longer?&quot; Haruka wondered.

The doctor&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;I just can&#39;t say for sure. It could be 
tomorrow or three weeks from now.&quot; Michiru groaned softly. She was ready 
to have her body back. Her doctor looked at her sympathetically. &quot;It&#39;s 
getting pretty uncomfortable for you isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;I just miss the small things.&quot; The violinist sighed.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Haruka asked, looking surprised.

The artist nodded mournfully. &quot;Hai, breathing deeply, bladder control . 
. . &quot;

Michiru saw her mate color slightly and had mercy on the blonde, letting 
the topic lapse.

The doctor smiled encouragingly at her tired patient. &quot;Well, it will all 
be over soon.&quot;</pre>
