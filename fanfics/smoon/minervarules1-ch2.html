You, my rose, with your Lydian lyre.

There hovers around you delight:

A beauty desired.

......

Even your garments plunder my eyes.

I am enchanted: I who once

Complained to the Cypress-born goddess,

Whom I now beseech.

......

Never let this lose me grace

But rather bring you back to me:

Amongst all mortal women the one

I most wish to see.

Sappho, Please, translated by Paul Roche

------

The woman entered the grounds of the Hikawa Jinga Shrine up on Sendai 
Hill following the directions given her and found the temple entrance. 
After explaining to the roguishly handsome young sandy haired blond in 
the tuxedo who she was and what she was doing there, she was shown to a 
side room. The blond knocked on the door, causing the woman&#39;s face to 
fall when she noticed the wedding band on the hand.

&quot;Coming.&quot; someone inside called out. A few seconds later, the door was 
opened to reveal a beautiful woman with aqua green hair done up in a bun 
who was wearing a kimono.

&quot;Ruka dear.&quot; the woman said to the blond in the tux, &quot;Don&#39;t come yet, 
she&#39;s not ready.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Haruka answered, &quot;But I have someone here who wanted to say 
&#145;hi&#39; before the wedding.&quot;

&quot;Saito-sama?&quot; the woman with Haruka asked, &quot;Are you in there?&quot;

&quot;Is that Haruna-sama?&quot; a voice from within the room asked.

Haruna Sakurada smiled cheerfully as she was led into the room, &quot;It sure 
is.&quot; she answered, &quot;So how&#39;s my favorite former student teacher doing on 
her wedding day?&quot;

&quot;A bit nervous.&quot; Kihomi answered as she stood up and bowed in her 
exquisite white wedding kimono known as a shiro-maku. She met Sakurada&#39;s 
smile with one of her own, &quot;Thank you for coming, especially after being 
told...&quot;

&quot;What, that you&#39;re marrying another woman?&quot; she asked, &quot;Please. I had a 
college professor who was a lesbian. You&#39;re more than just a former 
student teacher to me; you&#39;re a friend. Besides,&quot; she said with a 
twinkle in her eye, &quot;Weddings are a great place to meet eligible men.&quot;

Kihomi smirked at the last remark, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know about that...&quot;

As Michiru and Haruka&#39;s attention were focused on the two old friends, a 
set of approaching footsteps alerted all that they had company.

&quot;Michiru.&quot; Usagi said as she came into the room, &quot;If Kiho-chan is almost 
done, Rei&#39;s... Haruna-sensei?&quot; the blond asked in shock.

&quot;U... Usagi-san?&quot; Sakurada asked, equally surprised. Kihomi looked over 
at her friend and fellow teacher.

&quot;You two know each other?&quot; she asked. The older teacher looked over at 
her as her eye suddenly started twitching nervously.

&quot;She was a former student of mine.&quot; she said. &quot;How do you know her?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a friend.&quot; Kihomi answered.

Sakurada shook her head at that, &quot;Usagi, friends with a teacher? I never 
thought I&#39;d hear that.&quot;

Turning back to Usagi, the grey-eyed young woman smiled, &quot;Tell Rei and 
Sets-chan we&#39;re almost ready, and that the wedding will go on as 
scheduled.

Usagi nodded, adding, &quot;You look beautiful, Kiho-chan.&quot;

The teacher blushed pleasantly, &quot;Thank you, Usagi-chan.&quot; she said as her 
princess left the room.

---Half an Hour Later---

As the wedding ceremony finally got under way, Mamoru walked Setsuna 
down the aisle, stopping once they got to the front of the shrine. The 
future king then turned and joined Usagi and the other Inners (along 
with Haruna-sensei) who were gathered on one side of the aisle. Hotaru, 
standing next to her Michiru-mama, had never seen her adoptive mother 
and fellow Senshi looking so happy before. She was radiant in her own 
beautiful white shiro-maku kimono, her long hair pulled up in a 
traditional style.

Kihomi came in next, walked down the aisle by Haruka in her tux. At the 
end of the aisle, she and Setsuna each exchanged loving glances as the 
sandy blond went to stand by Hotaru and Michiru. Rei, standing in the 
formal garbs of the Shinto priesthood, purified the couple. Michiru then 
moved off to the side a bit to take photographs for the couple and their 
fellow Senshi.

After the purification, it was time for the exchange of vows. At first, 
this had presented a problem; traditionally, it was the groom who made 
the vows, and in this case there was no groom. Then again, this was far 
from a traditional wedding, and Rei had been more than willing to simply 
wave the formality and allow the brides to exchange vows this time.

&quot;Kiho-chan,&quot; Setsuna began as she stared into her love&#39;s eyes, &quot;I always 
thought that this was to be denied me, that I was destined to be forever 
alone. And then the fates took pity on me and brought you into my life. 
In you I have found more than just a lover; I&#39;ve found a best friend. I 
vow to always treasure you, to never take you for granted, and to always 
be there as your wife, your friend, and your confidant.&quot;

The teacher blushed a bit, then began her own vows, &quot;Sets-chan, a lot 
has happened to me in this past year. I don&#39;t know how I could&#39;ve got 
through any of it without you by my side. You are everything to me, and 
I vow to always love you, to cherish you, and to never leave your side.&quot;

The traditional ceremony of san san kudo, or the three-times-three 
exchange of wedding cups was then performed as Setsuna knelt with Kihomi 
in front of a small table containing three semi-flat sake cups arranged 
from smallest to largest. As each cup was filled with sake, Setsuna 
would silently pick it up, take three sips, and then pass the cup to 
Kihomi who likewise took three sips from it.

In a traditional Shinto wedding, sake would then be shared between the 
parents of the bride and groom, as well as certain immediate family 
members, to represent the union of their households through the wedding. 
In the absence of any immediate family, however, Kihomi offered the 
largest cup, still containing sake, to Haruka. The Sandy blond took a 
sip, passing it to Hotaru, who likewise took a sip and passed it to 
Michiru. In this way, the family bonds between the five Outers were now 
symbolically strengthened by the ceremonies of the wedding.

Finally, the two brides left the shrine with Rei in order to offer gifts 
to the kami of the shrine for good fortune in the wedding. With this 
final part of the ceremony over, the two were now wed.

---The Honeymoon---

The wedding reception had gone off wonderfully. Traditionally, both sets 
of parents use the wedding reception to talk of the good aspects of 
their child and of how lucky the bride or groom is to be married to 
them. In the absence of any parents however, each of the Senshi took 
turns talking about the two brides.

The highlight of the night, though, had to have been when it was Usagi 
and Haruna-sensei&#39;s turn. Bad feelings of the past had kept them 
avoiding each other throughout the wedding and most of the reception. 
After a while however, they&#39;d both independently had way too much sake. 
They thus both stood up to give their speeches at the same time, weeping 
as they rambled on in an inebriated state about how wonderful Setsuna 
and Kihomi were, and then hugged each other before taking their seats 
again.

Now, in the hotel room they&#39;d rented for their honeymoon, Setsuna, 
wearing a red and white kimono, went over to the tray with champagne by 
the foot of the bed as Kihomi excused herself to use the bathroom. 
Popping the cork, she poured two glasses as the sound of footsteps 
alerted her that her new wife had entered the room. She turned around to 
face her love and stopped.

Kihomi stood before her in her own beautiful kimono, smiling as she 
admired her new wedding ring. She looked up at Setsuna and noticed her 
staring at her.

&quot;Sets-chan? Is something wrong?&quot;

Setsuna crossed the distance between as she gave one of the champagne 
glasses to Kihomi, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; she said softly, &quot;Just... I&#39;ve never 
seen you this beautiful, or been this happy before.&quot; she answered.

Kihomi smiled as she took a sip from her glass. She then set her glass 
down and walked behind her wife. As Setsuna took a sip of her own glass 
she suddenly felt the teacher undoing her obi (kimono sash), pulling it 
off from around the Time Senshi&#39;s waist. Kihomi then took Setsuna&#39;s 
glass away from her and set it next to hers as she began to slowly 
disrobe her. Setsuna closed her eyes and smiled as she felt her love&#39;s 
hands pulling her kimono off, and then began undoing the various 
wrappings underneath.

Soon, Setsuna found herself completely nude in the hotel room as Kihomi 
wrapped her arms around her from behind, kissing her just behind her 
right ear. The Time Senshi let out a low moan and leaned her head back 
as the teacher began to cup her breasts with her hands. Tilting her head 
back, her lips met Kihomi&#39;s as her love began to give attention to her 
now hardened nipples, rubbing them back and forth between her thumbs and 
forefingers as her tongue and Setsuna&#39;s danced together in each other&#39;s 
mouths.

Setsuna turned to face Kihomi, removing her tongue as she sucked on her 
wife&#39;s lower lip while reaching behind her. Now it was Kihomi&#39;s turn to 
moan as the Time Senshi moved from her lips to place little nip bites on 
her neck. Setsuna then reached around to untie her wife&#39;s obi. Within a 
few seconds Kihomi&#39;s obi was laying in a pile on the hotel carpet. It 
was soon enough joined by her kimono and under clothes.

Their lips met again as Kihomi gently glided her beloved back towards 
the bed. Setsuna lay back as her lover lay down on top of her, both 
women entangling their fingers as their tongues once again met. Kihomi 
broke the kiss as she moved her way down and began to lick slowly around 
her wife&#39;s left areola, finally taking her nipple into her mouth. 
Setsuna arched her back and let go of her love&#39;s fingers as she placed 
both hands behind the teacher&#39;s head, trying to get as much of herself 
into Kihomi&#39;s mouth as she could. Kihomi raked her wife&#39;s nipple ever so 
lightly with her teeth as she lifted her mouth off, moving on to 
Setsuna&#39;s right nipple.

Setsuna was moaning louder now as she tangled her wife&#39;s hair around her 
fingers. Her jaw had gone slack and her chest was rising and falling 
rapidly now with her quickened breath. Kihomi lifted herself up once 
again, licking her beloved&#39;s lower lip. Setsuna raised her head quickly, 
kissing the teacher deeply. When Kihomi broke the kiss, she smiled 
wickedly at her wife.

&quot;And now my love,&quot; she said, pausing to kiss Setsuna on the tip of her 
nose, &quot;The marriage consummation.&quot;

Setsuna began to chuckle at Kihomi&#39;s humor, but her giggling quickly 
died off as the teacher, cupping the Time Senshi&#39;s breasts in her hands 
once again, began to kiss a painfully slow trail down her neck, chest 
and abdomen. At Setsuna&#39;s bellybutton, Kihomi brought her hands down, 
slipping then between her love&#39;s legs and under her thighs. She lifted 
her wife&#39;s legs, resting then on her back and laying bare her love&#39;s 
greatest treasure.

And now, with a leg resting on each of her shoulders and the familiar 
scent of Setsuna&#39;s musk filling her nostrils, Kihomi paused as she 
stared at the sight before her. She had made love to Setsuna countless 
times by now, but not as her wife. She felt like a priest gazing upon 
the Holy of Holies, or a temple maiden kneeling before a goddess. As 
Setsuna glanced down in anticipation, she saw the love in her wife&#39;s 
eyes. Kihomi looked up from her love&#39;s sex to meet her gaze.

&quot;My love.&quot; she said in a tender tone, &quot;My goddess, my life.&quot;

With that, she bent her head down and kissed Setsuna ever so lightly on 
the outside of her labia. The time Senshi immediately threw her head 
back and inhaled a quick breath of air as Kihomi then kissed her again, 
lightly brushing her lips across her now swollen clitoris. As Setsuna 
began to gasp for air, her wife started to probe her with her mouth and 
tongue, going as deeply as she could in her beloved&#39;s moistened sex. She 
then removed her tongue, inserting first one finger, then a second as 
she concentrated her tongue on Setsuna&#39;s clit.

&quot;Gnnnh! Huh, huh, gnnnh!&quot; the Time Senshi grunted out incoherently as 
she thrusted her hips and thrashed her head from side to side. Kihomi 
soon enough began to feel Setsuna&#39;s muscles tightening around her 
fingers. She began to suck on her wife&#39;s clitoris harder now as she 
continued to thrust in and out with her two fingers.

&quot;KIHOMIIII!&quot; Setsuna screamed out as she finally orgasmed. As she went 
limp, Kihomi could still feel small tremors passing through her beloved. 
She removed her fingers, kissing her wife&#39;s labia one last time as she 
then moved up a bit and lay her head on Setsuna&#39;s pelvis.

Setsuna reached down and started to run her fingers through Kihomi&#39;s 
soft brown hair. &quot;I... I love you.&quot; she gasped. Kihomi turned to kiss 
her on her abdomen.

&quot;I love you too, Sets-chan.&quot; she said.

Setsuna suddenly looked somewhat melancholy. &quot;Kiho-chan,&quot; she began 
uneasily, &quot;Do you... Do you suppose we&#39;ll always be this happy?&quot;

Kihomi&#39;s mind wandered back to events of six months ago, of seeing her 
future self with Lady Pluto. She found herself smiling as she met her 
new wife&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Absolutely.&quot; she said as she moved herself up and stroked 
affectionately at Setsuna&#39;s cheek, &quot;In fact, I think I can almost 
guarantee it.&quot;

---Crystal Tokyo, 3044---

Neo Queen Serenity rushed to the royal apartment, followed closely by 
King Endymion and Princess Usagi II. They&#39;d only received word a short 
time ago, yet already the word had spread all throughout the kingdom. 
Her Royal Highness was met at the door by Lady Mars.

&quot;Mars,&quot; the queen asked, &quot;Is it true? Is...&quot;

&quot;Yes, my queen.&quot; Lady Mars answered excitedly, &quot;Come quickly. Ladies 
Uranus, Neptune and Hotaru have already arrived, along with most of the 
other royals.&quot;

The king and queen entered the hallway following Lady Mars, only to be 
passed by the young princess. Usagi II ran toward the living quarters, 
reaching it breathlessly as she looked at the royals already present. By 
one of the columns she saw Ladies Mercury and Jupiter, the latter&#39;s new 
arm a shade of emerald green. As she looked around, she spotted Lady 
Pluto on a large couch, her wife Lady Minerva protectively cradling her 
in her strong arms. Behind the couch stood the other Outers.

&quot;P... Puu...&quot; the princess gasped out, breathless after her run, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Small Lady,&quot; Lady Pluto said in concern, &quot;Calm down and catch your 
breath.&quot;

The pink haired heir to the throne stopped to catch her breath, &quot;Puu,&quot; 
she finally said, &quot;I... I heard that... Is it really...&quot;

Pluto smiled warmly at Usagi II as she motioned the princess to come 
closer. She did so, just as Lady Mars entered with her parents. The 
three looked on smiling as Lady Pluto took the princess&#39; hands and 
placed them on her belly.

After a few moments, the princess bounced up excitedly.

&quot;She kicked!&quot; she squealed with joy, &quot;Oh Puu, I felt the baby kick!&quot;

Lady Pluto smiled at the princess&#39; reaction as the Outers behind her 
chuckled good naturedly. Lady Minerva began to rub her wife&#39;s distended 
belly as the queen and king came over to congratulate her and Pluto.

---Epilogue---

---An Alternate Reality, the Present---

She looked out of the palace window at the vast alien landscape before 
her. After the events of six months ago, she and several of the other 
Time Guardians had stayed in touch. Among the things she learned were 
the surprising number of timelines in which the Great Moon Kingdom of 
the Silver Millennium no longer existed. The Guardian of the timegate 
allowed a small shiver to travel down her back as she tried to conceive 
of a threat capable of ending the Moon Empire.

She also learned of other things, such as certain timelines where her 
other selves were not eternal, but had in fact reincarnated over and 
over again ad infinitum. Then, there were realities where she had never 
met...

A tender touch on her shoulders brought her out of her troubled 
thoughts. She allowed a smile to now tease her lips as a hand moved 
through her dark braided hair. She turned to look at her love.

Her dark-skinned wife tilted her head as she looked at her, &quot;Beloved?&quot; 
she asked, her skirt clinging tightly to her hips and the large group of 
beaded necklaces hanging loosely from her neck, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

Pluto turned from her to look back out her palace window. &quot;Minerva.&quot; she 
said, &quot;What if... What if we had never met?&quot;

Minerva was taken aback by the question, &quot;Why would you ask something 
like that?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Choices.&quot; she muttered, &quot;Possibilities, alternatives. What I mean is, 
say that embassy ship had never found your world. Or, say that...&quot;

&quot;But that ship did find my world.&quot; Minerva answered, &quot;I did come back 
with the ambassadors, and you and I did meet. And as for what might&#39;ve 
been, it&#39;s not nearly as important to me as what is.&quot;

Pluto looked at her wife for a few seconds before she finally smiled and 
kissed her on her cheek. Minerva smiled back as she returned the kiss. 
She then brought her right hand up to her chest where her heart was, 
reached forward, and placed it over Pluto&#39;s heart.

&quot;You&#39;ll always be in my heart.&quot; she said tenderly, &quot;Just as I&#39;ll always 
be in yours.&quot;

Pluto returned the gesture, then followed her wife into the bed chamber.</pre>
