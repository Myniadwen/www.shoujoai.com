<h1>Wishful Thinking (part 6 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ladyhades.html">ladyhades</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/wishthink-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&#39;Ugh. Where the hell am I?&#39; Violet eyes cracked open slowly. &#39;White. 
Everywhere. Everything seems so bright.&#39; She blinked in sleepy 
confusion, and realized she was lying on her back, in a strange room. 
She tried to lift her head, but to no avail. It was as if every part of 
her had grown very, very heavy, and impossible to move. Her eyes had 
already begun to ache from the harsh lighting.

&#39;Ok, so what the hell happened? How did I get here? Oh damn. The demon! 
I have to warn everyone!&#39;

It took every ounce of strength she could find in her body, but she 
finally succeeded in coaxing stiff limbs back to life. She drew her 
knees up, wincing at the horrible cracking sound her joints emitted. 
&#39;God, how long have I been laying here?&#39; She did a quick once over of 
her body. Her armor and uniform had been removed. She was now clothed in 
a loose white shirt, and light drawstring pants. Her wounds had also 
been dressed, apparently.

She tried to push herself up into a sitting position with her arms, but 
the sudden searing pain that ripped through the left side of her body 
and down her left arm nearly caused her to black out. Her head spun, and 
her eyes screwed tightly shut.

&#39;Am I dead? I must be dead. This is hell!&#39;

&quot;Rei? Oh God, Rei! You&#39;re awake!&quot;

&#39;Can&#39;t be Satan, the voice is too beautiful.&#39;

Mars eased her eyes open, despite the muscle spasms that tore through 
her, and was taken aback by the sight that greeted her.

&#39;Mina?&#39;

The blonde had obviously not been sleeping well. Her face was pale, on 
the brink of sickly, and dark circles under her eyes marred her perfect 
features. The simple white dress she was wearing was rumpled and 
creased, a sure sign she had slept in it. Even the golden locks Mars had 
spent so much time running her fingers through looked limp and tired.

Minako pressed a soothing hand to her face, gently pushing Rei&#39;s bangs 
out of her eyes. &quot;Listen. I&#39;ve got to get Mercury, ok? Please, don&#39;t try 
to move. I&#39;ll be back as soon as I can.&quot;

Mars tried to smile, but found the act impossible. She gave Venus the 
only sign of comprehension she could manage by taking the blonde&#39;s free 
hand with her own and squeezing Minako&#39;s fingers.

If Rei hadn&#39;t been in so much pain already, the smile Minako gave her 
would have broken her in half.

&quot;I&#39;ll come right back. I promise.&quot; she whispered, sliding her hand out 
of Rei&#39;s and disappearing down the hall.

Mars gritted her teeth and slammed her palm into her forehead out of 
sheer agony. &#39;I swear to God, it feels like something is crawling around 
in my wound! I&#39;m about ready to chew my own damn arm off!&#39;

Just as Rei began to seriously contemplate the idea, Minako returned 
with Mercury in tow. The ice soldier set a glass of something that 
looked suspiciously like pure, undiluted evil down on the end table to 
the right of her bed, and gave a slight nod to Venus.

&quot;Rei, we&#39;re going to sit you up now, so you can drink some medicine 
Mercury cooked up. Please don&#39;t punch either of us.&quot; the blonde said 
with a nervous grin.

&#39;Punch her? What the hell is she talking about? Why would I punch her?&#39;

Minako looked across the bed at Ami, and nodded quickly. Ami slid one 
hand under Rei&#39;s right shoulder, and the other at the small of her back, 
with the blonde following suite on the opposite side.

&quot;On three.&quot; Ami instructed.

&quot;One.&quot;

&#39;Oh no. Oh hell no...&#39;

&quot;Two.&quot;

&#39;Wait!&#39; Mars turned pitiful, pleading violet eyes towards Venus. &#39;Don&#39;t 
do this Mina. Please don&#39;t do this. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry for any wrongs 
I have ever committed upon you, please, for the love of all that is pure 
and good...&#39;

Minako winced.

&quot;Three.&quot;

The pain Mars had experienced thus far seemed to be little more than a 
mere paper cut compared to what she felt now at the hands of her 
so-called friends. Her muscles screamed in torment as her body was 
shifted up into a sitting position. Her arm burned as though it were on 
fire.

&#39;I was wrong. She IS Satan! Punch them? No. When I can move, I&#39;m going 
to fucking kill them.&#39;

&quot;Rei, I&#39;m really sorry. I really am. But we had to do it.&quot; Minako 
explained weakly, quickly maneuvering pillows in a desperate attempt to 
make the fire soldier more comfortable.

&#39;Funny. That was going to be my excuse when they ARREST me.&#39; Rei thought 
bitterly between waves of ungodly pain.

Ami&#39;s hand was suddenly under her chin, gently tilting her head up, and 
the cup of evil black broth was brought to her lips.

Mars took a huge sip of the concoction, and nearly spit it all back out. 
It was horribly bitter, and it made her mouth numb. She wasn&#39;t sure how 
much more unpleasantness she could handle today.

&quot;I know it&#39;s rotten, but you need to drink the whole glass.&quot; Mercury 
tried gently. &quot;You won&#39;t feel anything after it kicks in, trust me.&quot;

Rei gave Ami a rather doubtful look, but drank the rest of the sludge 
anyway, erupting into a violent fit of coughing. Each gasp seemed to 
strain at her already throbbing torso, so when a hand slipped into hers, 
she caught it in a death grip and hung on for dear life.

After her coughing subsided, Mars discovered that a rather euphoric 
feeling had begun to wash over her body. She noticed that the horrible 
stabs of pain were ebbing away into mere pinpricks, and it was much 
easier to breathe now. She carefully eased herself back against the 
headboard, and closed her eyes.

When she opened them again, the room was much darker. Apparently someone 
had been kind enough to tone down the lights. What felt like only a 
minute or two had apparently been much longer. She was alone in the room 
now, except for Minako, who was curled up in a tiny chair at the 
soldier&#39;s bedside, fast asleep.

The horrible crawling feeling suddenly seeped back into her shoulder, 
but this time, it wasn&#39;t painful. Mars shrugged it off as the wound 
trying to heal itself, and turned her gaze back towards the blonde.

&#39;I should wake her up. I need to warn everyone about the attack, and god 
only knows how long I&#39;ve been in this room already.&#39;

But she couldn&#39;t bring herself to do it. Venus looked so peaceful, and 
Mars really wasn&#39;t sure about how many peaceful days they had left.

&#39;Tomorrow never comes until it&#39;s too late.&#39;

Whatever it was that Mercury dumped down her throat still gave her the 
warm fuzzy feelings, and looking at the blonde seemed to make them 
worse. Everything seemed to be going so horribly wrong, but Rei felt 
happy. It was confusing, and it was really starting to piss her off.

A light twitch across the fingers of her right hand brought her 
attention to her lap, where she was surprised to discover Minako&#39;s 
fingers still laced between her own.

&#39;She was holding my hand, this whole time. And the chair. I bet she&#39;s 
been sleeping here next to me since I got here. That explains the rough 
appearance. &#39;

Rei shook her head absently. Images from the dreams she had while 
knocked out began to creep forward from the depths of her subconscious.

&#39;Kissing her, holding her. I remember now!&#39;

She could her Mina&#39;s voice in the back of her head, soft, but clear. 
&quot;Just don&#39;t let go.&quot;

&quot;Never..&quot; Mars whispered hoarsely, her voice cracked and rough from days 
of non-use. She cast her gaze back on Minako, and slumped down wearily. 
&#39;That&#39;s why you were so angry when I didn&#39;t remember. Oh, god, I&#39;m so 
sorry.&#39;

She brought their entwined hands to her lips and kissed the back of 
Mina&#39;s hand tenderly. &#39;I&#39;ll make it up to you. I swear it.&#39;

The blonde shifted slightly with Rei&#39;s movement, and blue eyes fluttered 
open. &quot;Mmm. Good nap.&quot; She purred with a warm smile and light stretch. 
&quot;You feeling better?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, quite a bit actually. How long was I out?&quot;

&quot;Three days.&quot;

&quot;Three days? Damn.&quot; &#39;That gives us eighteen days until everything falls 
apart.&#39;

&quot;Any pain?&quot; the blonde inquired.

Minako&#39;s tear-stained face flashed briefly in her mind, and Mars had to 
swallow the hard lump in her throat. &quot;No. No pain.&quot;

Venus seemed to notice at last that she was still holding Rei&#39;s hand. A 
light blush colored her cheeks, and she began to mutter apologies and 
pull her hand back.

Mars tightened her hold on her hand and shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t be sorry 
Mina. I&#39;m not.&quot; she whispered in her raspy voice.

The blonde just stared at the wounded soldier, and Rei could swear she 
saw the light of understanding dawn in her eyes.

&quot;Rei...you...&quot;

&quot;Rei!&quot; The door to the infirmary room swung open and banged against the 
wall violently.

Venus jerked herself away from Mars guiltily, as though she had been 
burned. Rei on the other hand barely had the time to recover from her 
shock when a pig-tailed blonde mass flung itself across her lap.

&quot;Princess?&quot;

&quot;Oh Rei! You really are awake! I was so worried!&quot; Serenity wailed, blue 
eyes glittering with unshed tears. She firmly wrapped tiny arms around 
the fire soldier&#39;s waist and hugged her midsection tight.

Mars opened her mouth to say something, anything, but for the life of 
her, she couldn&#39;t think of a damn thing to say. She snapped her jaw shut 
with an audible click and looked back over to where Venus should&#39;ve 
been, but the chair had been vacated.

In through the door came Jupiter and Mercury now, both looking guilty. 
Luna and Artemis trailed behind them, and Rei could faintly pick up the 
black feline&#39;s voice grumbling about royal behavior and protocols.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry Rei. I told her to let you sleep, but you know how she 
gets.&quot; Makoto said with a sheepish grin.

Mars nodded dumbly, and looked down at her charge, still clinging to her 
waist. &quot;Serenity, don&#39;t kneel on the floor. Come on, you can sit on the 
bed. &quot; she muttered in gruff affection, shifting her legs over to make 
room.

The Princess gave her a smile that made her stomach do somersaults, and 
immediately relocated herself to the edge of Rei&#39;s bed. Once situated, 
she took a hold of Rei&#39;s hand and refused to let go. Now Mars was 
thoroughly confused. Not even five minutes ago she was trying to patch 
things up with Minako, and now here she was, catering to her Princess.

&#39;Yeah. I&#39;m doing a damn fine job at making it up to Venus. It&#39;s really 
amazing how quickly I can screw things up. I think this is a new record, 
even for me. Where did she go anyway?&#39;

Surprisingly, her sweet, naive princess had the answer. &quot;Ah, Venus? Why 
are you hitting your head against the wall?&quot;

All eyes turned to the goddess of love., currently thumping her head 
against the far wall and muttering to herself. Minako stopped, mid 
thump, and spun around to face her friends, letting out a high pitched 
nervous laugh. &quot;Um, helps me think?&quot; she tried lamely.

&quot;Leave it to a blonde.&quot; Mars teased gently. Venus caught the warm 
affection in her tone and gave her a genuine smile in return.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Serenity protested belatedly, thwacking Mars in the arm.

&#39;Woo! Saved!&#39; Rei cheered internally as the group laughed. That bizarre 
crawling feeling suddenly started up in her shoulder again, and her left 
arm twitched visibly. Her attention snapped back to her wound, and she 
stared at her arm quizzically. &#39;Now what the hell was that?&#39; Another 
crawling sensation sent needles of pain this time, and she winced 
slightly.

Mercury noticed Rei&#39;s discomfort, and responded by producing yet another 
glass of black slime, seemingly out of nowhere. With a smile and a 
flourish, she presented it to Mars. Rei closed her eyes and groaned 
miserably, causing the others to chuckle.

&quot;Yeah yeah, laugh at my pain.&quot; she griped good naturedly, downing the 
glass with much less fuss. She made a face of disgust and placed the 
glass on the end table. Everyone seemed to be watching her, waiting for 
something. It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out what. &quot;So. I suppose 
you all wanna know what happened.&quot; she said at last.

A silent collective nod.

Rei looked around the room, gazing at all the faces of the people she 
cared about so much. They had all been through so much already, how 
could she possibly tell them that they would all be dead by the end of 
the month? She just had no idea on how to proceed, and to be honest, it 
was making her feel quite ill.

Luna hopped up onto the bed beside her, and placed a paw on her leg. 
&quot;Whatever it is Rei, we can deal with it together.&quot;

Mars gave her a grateful smile, and took a deep breath for inner 
strength. &quot;I ran into a scout, one of Beryl&#39;s men. It had attacked a 
peasant, and killed him. I was going to just destroy the beast, but it&#39;s 
uniform caught my eye.&quot;

&quot;Using standard Martian practices, I questioned him.&quot; she paused at this 
point, unsure on how to continue. &quot;He uh, saw it would be in his best 
interest to cooperate, I got careless, and he got in a lucky shot, but 
not before he informed me that Queen Beryl is launching a massive attack 
against our kingdom, on the night of Serenity&#39;s ball.&quot;

Everyone gasped.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Luna asked, worry evident on her face.

&quot;Yeah. To back it up, I had a vision about it the night before I 
questioned the scout.&quot; Rei replied, a light tinge coloring her cheeks as 
she recalled what else she had done that night. &#39;Damn drugs. I feel like 
I&#39;m ready to float away. I need to focus.&#39; &quot;It&#39;s not pretty, and I&#39;m 
sure at least one of us doesn&#39;t make it through.&quot; Mars looked at Ami as 
she spoke, and Jupiter moved to stand beside her protectively, laying a 
hand on her shoulder and squeezing it gently.

Venus frowned, her leader mode kicking in high gear. &quot;There have been 
rumors about an attack for awhile, but no one was able to confirm or 
deny. This means that crazy witch had all this time, years for all we 
know, to build her damn army...&quot;

&quot;And we get eighteen days.&quot; Jupiter finished quietly.

&quot;The kingdom will be finished...&quot; Artemis murmured.

&quot;Artemis! Don&#39;t say that!&quot; Ami cried angrily.

Mars had to fight the insane urge to laugh hysterically. They did seem 
rather screwed when you looked at it that way. Why was everything so 
funny all of a sudden?

&quot;What about the other Earthlings?&quot; Serenity asked quietly.

Everyone understood what she meant immediately.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Minako replied honestly, &quot;But I will tell you this. Here 
on out, we&#39;re on lockdown. No Earthlings in, no Earthlings out. We could 
round up and question the ones that are still here, however. May prove 
useful.&quot;

&quot;Oooh, can I question Endymion?&quot; Mars asked enthusiastically.

The other soldiers eyed her strangely.

&quot;It&#39;s the drugs.&quot; Mercury whispered helpfully.

&quot;Ah.&quot; Venus said, nodding in understanding. She looked back at Mars. 
&quot;No. You may not. I&#39;ve seen the results of your questioning methods.&quot; 
she smirked.

Serenity turned to Mars, a look of horror on her face.

&quot;Hey! I wouldn&#39;t hurt him!&quot; she cried in defense. &#39;Much.&#39;

&quot;We need a plan.&quot; Jupiter said seriously. &quot;But first, we need to tell 
the Queen.&quot;

The group fell into a deadly silence.</pre>
