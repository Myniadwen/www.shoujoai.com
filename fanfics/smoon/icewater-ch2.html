<h1>Ice and Water (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/icewater-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;So you work with Michiru?&quot; Seiya Kou asked
charmingly.

Ami sighed softly. There were several things that Ami
had rapidly learned about her profession, not too long
after she graduated university. The first was that it
wasn&#39;t understood by most laymen, second that words
like &#39;marine biologist&#39; and &#39;climate change&#39; quickly
made people&#39;s eyes glaze over and third simply that
her work probably wouldn&#39;t make good party
conversation. Therefore whenever anyone asked about
her job she sketched in an outline and then quickly
changed the subject.

Noting that she had already achieved &#39;eye-glaze&#39; Ami
asked the tall woman, &quot;And do you actually cross-dress
in your performances?&quot;

Seiya smiled back as she took a drink, her long black
ponytail flowing down her back. &quot;Yes and no,&quot; she
answered, &quot;we all wear men&#39;s suits, but we don&#39;t
conceal our gender, either.&quot; They stood close but not
uncomfortably so, the other woman respecting Ami&#39;s
space.

&quot;It must be interesting,&quot; Ami murmured, her own blue
hair falling into her eyes. Her black jeans hugged her
slim body, the simple white T-shirt she had picked out
clinging as she sweated a bit. Feeling a gaze resting
on her Ami looked up, blinking as she met Michiru&#39;s
searching gaze, then the other woman looked away.

&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; Seiya saw the interaction, eyes twinkling
with amusement, &quot;you have to watch out for Michiru,
her cool surface can be deceptive.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ami asked almost unwillingly.

Seiya chuckled softly at that, knowing that Ami wanted
to know more no matter how casual she seemed. &quot;You
know we dated?&quot; she asked and when Ami nodded she
continued, &quot;I may have a reputation as a player but it
was she who went after me.&quot;

Ami felt her gaze drawn back to Michiru, noticing her
talking to a tall orange haired woman, then Michiru
shifted so that she could see Ami again, her lips
drawing up in a beautiful smile as they saw each other
again. Forcing herself to look at Seiya she conceded,
&quot;I can imagine.&quot; Seiya looked at he and suddenly Ami
felt oddly frightened by the piercing quality of the
woman&#39;s eyes, wondering what secrets she could see.

With a faint smile Seiya sipped at her drink then
murmured, &quot;Don&#39;t be too surprised if she or Haruka do
approach you tonight.&quot;

Ami was swallowing as Seiya said that and nearly
choked on her drink. &quot;What?&quot; she managed, wheezing
slightly.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Seiya apologized, reaching out to firmly
thump the other woman&#39;s back. Once she was sure Ami
was recovered she said wryly, &quot;I thought you already
knew, but Michiru and Haruka have a open
relationship.&quot;

&#39;Open...?&#39; Ami thought in surprise as Seiya excused
herself, stalking through the crowd. Feeling more than
a little confused she retreated to the mini-bar,
pouring herself another drink and being careful to go
easy on the alcohol.

&quot;So,&quot; the voice purred &quot;you&#39;re the famous Ami Mizuno.&quot;

Ami turned around to see the tall, orange haired woman
standing nearby, casually wearing a dress that
probably would have cost Ami a month&#39;s salary, at
least. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean,&quot; Ami said mildly,
&quot;miss...?&quot;

Gazing at her with a frankly predatory look in her
eyes she purred, &quot;Arisugawa Juri.&quot; She studied Ami for
a moment she continued, &quot;After hearing Michiru talk
about you, I thought I should see you for myself.&quot;

Ami felt a flash of warmth knowing that Michiru talked
about her, but she stayed cool. &quot;That&#39;s nice,&quot; she
said with a slight smile.

Juri chuckled softly, the two soon falling into quiet
conversation. Thankfully Juri soon made it clear her
interest was based more on Ami&#39;s resemblance to a old
friend of Juri&#39;s, and once Ami clarified that she
wasn&#39;t available Juri backed off gracefully.

As the evening passed Ami was introduced around,
talking to each of the couples and guests, snacking
and occasionally dancing when asked. Once midnight
came they raised their glasses in a toast to celebrate
the new year even as they saw the celebrations in
Tokyo on TV.

And all the time Ami would feel that gaze resting on
her, or look up and meet Michiru&#39;s smoky eyes. Each
time Ami wondered what was going through her friend
Michiru&#39;s mind, what she was thinking about when she
considered Ami so intently.

&#39;I should get out of here before I embarrass myself,&#39;
Ami thought, carefully making her way to the door as
the others began to quietly take their leave. Part of
her wanted to linger, to take Michiru aside and find
out if what Seiya had said was true.. but she was
scared, too.

&quot;Going so soon?&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice startled Ami from her
guilty thoughts. Running a hand through her blonde
hair she said apologetically, &quot;I need to go run
Arisugawa home, would you mind keeping Michiru company
until I get back?&quot;

&quot;I....&quot; Ami croaked out, then she cleared her throat.
&#39;What is she thinking?&#39; Ami wondered weakly, &#39;Doesn&#39;t
she see what&#39;s going on here?&#39; Taking a steadying
breath she managed to say, &quot;Of course, if you want me
to.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Haruka squeezed Ami&#39;s shoulder gently,
&quot;it&#39;ll mean a lot to Michiru.&quot;

Ami&#39;s mind was oddly blank as she watched Haruka and
Juri leave, making her and Michiru the last two people
in the room. Michiru smiled at her, gently taking
Ami&#39;s hand and drawing her over to the couch as she
sighed, &quot;I hope Seiya and Juri weren&#39;t too
aggressive.&quot;

Ami followed, her skin tingling a little in Michiru&#39;s
gentle but firm grip. &quot;Seiya was a prefect gentleman,
more or less,&quot; she answered her as she sat down, &quot;and
Juri backed off once I explained I wasn&#39;t available.&quot;

There was an odd look on Michiru&#39;s face when she heard
that, almost pain. &quot;Are you seeing someone?&quot; she asked
softly, sitting close to Ami despite the large size of
the couch.

Ami felt herself falling into Michiru&#39;s eyes, but
forced herself to focus. &quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Ami smiled wryly,
&quot;but Juri didn&#39;t need to know that.&quot; The scent of
Michiru&#39;s perfume teased her nose, and sitting so
close she could feel the warmth radiating off of her.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Michiru murmured, reaching out to rest a
hand on Ami&#39;s.

&quot;I need to go,&quot; Ami made herself rise, her legs made
shaky by a sudden surge of desire. If she stayed there
on the couch much longer she knew she would do
something that she or Michiru might regret... &quot;I&#39;ll
call a taxi back to the lab and get my car.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Michiru rose to fiercely take Ami&#39;s hand,
looking into her eyes with an expression of mixed
fondness and annoyance. &quot;For someone as smart as you
are,&quot; she said gently, &quot;you can be remarkably stupid.&quot;

&quot;Michiru...&quot; Ami didn&#39;t want to say it, knowing that
the hope blossoming in her heart was probably just a
case of self delusion.

Then swiftly Michiru closed the distance, pressing her
lips hungrily to Ami&#39;s as she wrapped her arms around
her. Ami moaned silently as Michiru circled her body
with her surprisingly strong arms, the kiss feverish
as they were pulled together tightly.

&quot;What about Haruka...?&quot; Ami managed breathlessly a few
moments later, Michiru&#39;s arms still wrapped around her
neck.

Michiru&#39;s gaze was kind, &quot;She knows, Ami... why do you
think she&#39;s taking so long just driving Juri home?&quot;

The next kiss obliterated the other questions from
Ami&#39;s mind, a gentle tongue stroking against her own,
fingers sliding down her back and caressing her skin.
Gently she was pulled down to the couch, passionate
kisses shifting to searching touches, and then a swift
disrobing. Throughout the long night they delighted in
each other&#39;s bodies, exhausting each other with sweet
pleasures and wild imaginations.

The next morning Ami awoke in a strange bed, gazing
for long minutes at Michiru&#39;s soundly sleeping form.
Sounds off in the distance drew her from the bed and
dressing quickly in her shirt and underwear Ami went
to take a look.

Haruka Tenoh had coffee on in the kitchen, her clothes
a bit rumpled and short blonde hair standing up a bit.
&quot;Good morning,&quot; she smiled pleasantly as she put
another cup of coffee down on the table, &quot;I was going
to bring you breakfast in bed but you two were
sleeping so soundly I didn&#39;t want to disturb you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Ami said softly as she sat, keeping
her eyes down at her coffee, &quot;I never expected this to
happen...&quot;

Haruka chuckled softly, sitting across from Ami at the
little table. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she said firmly, &quot;I&#39;m
sure Michiru told you that I know, right?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Ami admitted, &quot;but.. you love her.&quot;

&quot;Yes I do,&quot; Haruka said patiently, &quot;and I know she
loves me.&quot; A sudden smile, &quot;And I also know that she
loves you, and that doesn&#39;t detract from her loving
me, too.&quot;

&quot;I never thought about it that way,&quot; Ami admitted
softly.

&quot;Not that I didn&#39;t get jealous originally,&quot; Haruka
conceded with a shrug, &quot;but after Michiru introduced
you to me, I couldn&#39;t help liking you.&quot;

&quot;Morning,&quot; Michiru said to them sleepily as she walked
in the kitchen, wearing a old robe around her
beautiful body.

Ami felt that familiar flash of desire again, unabated
even by their lustful night, and noted Haruka had a
similar look on her face. They exchanged a sympathetic
glance even as she though, &#39;I wonder if I could get
used to...?&#39;

&quot;Did you ask Ami about our offer yet?&quot; Michiru asked
as she poured a cup of coffee.

&quot;I was just about to,&quot; Haruka grinned impishly.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Ami blinked.

&quot;I remember you mentioning you were looking for a
place since you left Makoto,&quot; Michiru took a drink of
her coffee with a happy sigh then continued, &quot;and that
you were living in a uncomfortable little apartment.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Ami confirmed, wondering where this was
going.

Haruka was clearly enjoying her confusion, and her
smile was nearly wicked. &quot;Well,&quot; she smoothly took
over, &quot;we just happen to have a comfortably sized
basement, one that could be easily converted into a
suite.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re asking me to move in with you?&quot; Ami squeaked.

Michiru set her cup down, took Haruka&#39;s hand and then
Ami&#39;s. &quot;Please,&quot; she said, squeezing both of them
gently.

&quot;This is a very bad idea,&quot; Ami said weakly, her pulse
pounding in her ears, &quot;not to mention being totally
insane.&quot;

&quot;Is that a yes or a no?&quot; Haruka smiled then purred
seductively, &quot;I&#39;m hoping for a yes, if only to... get
to know you better.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t scare her off,&quot; Michiru slapped Haruka&#39;s arm.

&#39;Very, very bad idea,&#39; Ami thought, imagining all the
things that could go wrong. Looking up she saw the
love in Michiru&#39;s eyes along with compassion and
caring in Haruka&#39;s, and suddenly her mind was made up
for her. &quot;Yes,&quot; Ami said with a firm nod.

The End

Notes: This started out as a request from a reader for
a Ami/Michiru fic, and the idea sort of bubbled in the
back of my brain for awhile until I got this. I
couldn&#39;t quite see Ami breaking up a couple, even by
accident, so I wrote the ending this way...</pre>
