<h1>Guessing Games</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fade.html">Fade</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The crowd of students rushed out of the school, enjoying their 
retrieved freedom. Two almost identical blondes stepped out on the
street together, stretching leisurely in the bright sun of the summer
break.

&quot;Haaa...at least, two months of vacation! I thought these final tests 
would last forever...and we even managed to graduate, thanks to 
Ami-chan...&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean Usagi, I really didn&#39;t think I would pull out 
through this...speaking of our savior, where is she? And where&#39;s Mako-
chan either?&quot;

At this, the odangoed girl grinned mischievously. The other blonde 
raised an inquisitive eyebrow, knowing all too well this I-know-
something-you-don&#39;t-smile.

&quot;All right Usagi, spit it out, I know you&#39;re dying to...so what&#39;s up?&quot;

Usagi giggled, the mischievous grin replaced by a conspiratorial one, 
Usagi leaned closer to her friend, whispering in her ear: &quot;Minako...
have you ever wondered about a secret relationship between those two?&quot;

This caught the other blonde off guard and she almost fell over. &quot;WHAT?&quot;
she gasped, then more quietly, &quot;Who? Mako-chan and Ami-chan? Together? 
No way! Are you out of your mind?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; frowned her friend, putting her hands on her hips. &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong with that? I think they would fit each other nicely, they&#39;d look
really cute together...&quot;

&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t have any problem with it...but...but Makoto is the most 
boy-centric girl I know...what with all the boy hunting? And Ami! Kami!
You can&#39;t even suggest to her this kind of thing with a guy, least of
all with another girl, without having her head blowing out!&quot;

&quot;Ami was the first one to figure things out about Haruka and Michiru...&quot;
Usagi pointed out. &quot;...And she took it fairly well...and being shy 
doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have crushes! As for Mako-chan, I&#39;m pretty sure 
her boys chasing is just a decoy for us. Why do all of her dates end up 
badly?&quot;

Minoko sighed bitterly. &quot;You could say the same about me, or Rei, for 
that matter you know? Each time we are on a date with a nice guy,
poofff, a youma shows up somewhere and throws everything out through the
window...we don&#39;t all have the luck to have a Mamo-kun served right at
our feet by Fate...&quot;

Usagi&#39;s hand flew to her mouth as her cheeks reddened in embarrassment.
&quot;Oh Minako, I&#39;m so sorry, I&#39;m such an airhead! Please, forgive me, I&#39;m 
always talking without thinking...&quot; she petered out lamely, tears
forming in her eyes.

Minako raised her hands in an attempt to stop Usagi&#39;s self berating.
&quot;Oy, now don&#39;t do that, that&#39;s not your fault at all...&quot; She smiled 
reassuringly and gave her friend a hug. &quot;Things will eventually sort out
and in the meantime, we have the best friends we could hope for...&quot;

Usagi returned a shy smile. They walked quietly for a while, each one 
rummaging in her own thoughts. Then, out of nowhere : &quot;...But, don&#39;t you
think they&#39;d do make a cute couple?&quot;

Minako stopped and considered it, a finger tapping at her lower lip. &quot;I
don&#39;t know...I&#39;d have thought that would have been Rei who would have 
been after Ami...&quot;

It was Usagi&#39;s turn to trip and almost fall down. &quot;Rei? What makes you 
say it? Do you have some information I don&#39;t?&quot;

Minako laughed at her princess&#39;s eagerness. &quot;No...that&#39;s just guessing
game, just like your Makoto&#39;s theory...but I think mine is better...&quot;
She smirked. &quot;After all, they know each other for the longest and don&#39;t
we say that the opposites attract each other? Rei is fiery and
passionate where Ami&#39;s cool tempered and rational. Rei&#39;s a miko and a
psychic when Ami&#39;s the most scientific and down to earth mind, only
steam can come out of this...and you were the one to tell me about the
cruise Rei invited Ami to...although...&quot;

&quot;Although?&quot;

&quot;Well...I&#39;ve always wondered about your constant bickering with Rei...&quot;
Minako burst out laughing when her friend went beet red. &quot;Why Usagi, is 
there something you&#39;d like to tell me?&quot;

&quot;Wha...what? No, of course not, there&#39;s nothing between her and me...I 
have my Mamo-chan, why would I want Rei?&quot; stammered the odangoed girl.

Minako, smiling like she&#39;d eaten the canary, went in for the kill. 
&quot;Let&#39;s see...she&#39;s easily one of the most beautiful girls in this world.
Plus she&#39;s got this glow of mystery around her, and as I said, Rei&#39;s so 
fiery and passionate, I can almost feel what it would be like to have
her arms around me, holding me tight...to have her warm and so sensual
body pressed against mine...&quot; Out of the corner of her eyes, she saw
Usagi become even redder if that was possible. Her voice dropped lower,
getting huskier. &quot;...To feel her fingers and her hot lips tracing
burning patterns on my skin over and over until...&quot; She trailed off in a
soft moan, which seemed to snap the other girl out of her reverie.

&quot;Minako!&quot; By now, Usagi was bug-eyed and slightly panting, noted Minako.

She chuckled, had Usagi been a male, she&#39;d have died from lethal
nosebleed long ago.

Usagi shook her head to free her mind of the all too vivid image of two 
of her best friends involved in something that would boil the blood of a
crocodile caught in the ice. &quot;You&#39;re such a naughty girl!&quot; Having 
recollected herself, she smiled slyly.

&quot;By the way, I seem to recall that you were the one she was hunting down
when she was possessed by this youma back when you went to visit her 
school...she even got you, then you actually know what it feels like, 
you don&#39;t have to imagine at all, and for what I just heard, you enjoyed
it a great deal...&quot;

It was Minako&#39;s turn to blush brightly. &quot;Hey, it never got that far! And
as you said, it was the youma, not her...&quot;

Pleased with herself to have caught the other girl at her own game, 
Usagi decided to come back to their former subject. &quot;And my theory is as
good as yours. Makoto is as hot-tempered as Rei, but she&#39;s also sweet
and caring. She&#39;s strong and she&#39;s always seemed extra protective
wherever Ami was concerned. And Ami has always had this calming effect
on Makoto. Sometimes, it feels like she&#39;s the only one who can bring her
peace, because Makoto trusts and respects her implicitly. They really
would be good for each other...&quot;

Minako&#39;s face took a far away look. &quot;Yeah, Mako-chan&#39;s so strong, and 
she&#39;s got some experience...she must be quite something too...and those 
breasts...&quot;

&quot;Minako! Will you stop this!&quot; yelled the other blonde, her face set 
aflamed once again as she could picture far too well where her friend&#39;s 
thoughts had wandered.

Minako sighed dramatically, which made Usagi chuckle softly.

&quot;You know what, I know it&#39;s ridiculous and we don&#39;t even know for sure 
if any of them are into girls, but right now, I can&#39;t help feeling a bit
jealous of Ami...just like that. For the sake of it.&quot;

Usagi patted Minako&#39;s back in sympathy. ~I would be too if I hadn&#39;t 
already my Mamo-chan...and even like that...hum, I really should drop
this line of thoughts...I don&#39;t know what life has in store for us, but
I suspect things will work out on their time...~

&quot;And I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;d be jealous of her or about her instead. I 
can just see it : her lithe body pinned beneath mine, shivering and
bulking in the throes of passion...unable to vocalize anything else but
moans and gasps...what I would do to her, what I would make her
experience, what I would teach her...and she would be the best of
students as usual...&quot; Minako&#39;s eyes were blurred, her tongue slowly
licking her upper lip in anticipation...

That did it. This last comment sent Usagi for a loop and she landed very
ungracefully on her buttocks. She was now definitely speechless and 
staring at her friend like she had grown another head or something.

Minako smiled evilly &quot;What? I am the goddess of love after all...and 
don&#39;t look so shocked.&quot; She helped Usagi up but didn&#39;t let go of her 
hand. &quot;If you have wondered about Ami and Makoto, and about Rei, I&#39;m
sure you did about me too, and also about the Outers...&quot; Internally,
Minako was struggling not to double over in laughing at Usagi&#39;s look.
Instead, she leaned in close until her mouth was inches apart from her
friend&#39;s, whispering seductively. &quot;Don&#39;t even bother to deny it...&quot;

She watched her princess backpedaling hurriedly, stammering incoherent 
denials and slamming in the wall behind her. This time she couldn&#39;t 
help herself, Minako laughed, and laughed. So hard that she collapsed
on her knees, clutching desperately her stomach as her laughter became 
painful.

&quot;Oh, ha, ha...very funny, Mina-chan! Ok, maybe I deserved this one. 
I&#39;ll stop talking about all of this.&quot;

&quot;I never thought I&#39;d see the day you&#39;d admit being nosey!&quot; said the 
other blonde, faking wonderment.

Usagi frowned, then seemed to notice something particularly odd behind 
Minako. She blushed madly and squeaked  &quot;Hum, well, ok...I&#39;ve got to 
go, see you later...&quot; And she dashed down the street, followed by the 
musical laughter of her friend. However, the said laughter came to a
crashing end when the remaining blonde heard suddenly someone clearing
their throat. She turned around dreadfully, only to be met by two stern
stares and a very, very embarrassed one. &quot;Oh, Ohhh...&quot;
