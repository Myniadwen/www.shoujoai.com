<h1>Fallen from Grace (part 6 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;One teaspoon of baking soda! Not one tablespoon, Rei!&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Hotaru eyed the monstrous shape before her. It did not look like bread, 
no matter what the miko said.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand why you want to bake bread when we bought it just 
today,&quot; Rei mumbled, chopping the vegetables.

&quot;It&#39;s better homemade,&quot; Hotaru explained for, to her, what seemed like 
the thousandth time.

The shorter woman moved to dump the &quot;bread&quot; into the trash. Both she and 
Rei winced when it stuck to the pan.

&quot;I&#39;ll get that,&quot; the miko offered.

&quot;No, no,&quot; Hotaru said grabbing a knife to cut it out of the pan. &quot;I&#39;m 
starting to think you&#39;re worse than Minako and Usagi in the kitchen.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; the college student replied, causing Rei to grin. 
&quot;Usagi&#39;s cooking looks bad but it&#39;s edible. Yours....&quot;

They both looked at the blob that clung relentlessly to the pan.

&quot;Well... yours is not, let&#39;s put it that way.&quot;

Rei stuck out her tongue. &quot;I can cook you know. I just can&#39;t bake.&quot;

A protest died on the tip of Hotaru&#39;s tongue when she remembered the 
omelet.

&quot;Fine, I admit it. You can cook.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei replied, smirking smugly.

&quot;But, I have to tell the other about this... this... thing that won&#39;t 
get out of the damn pan!&quot;

The miko walked over and took the knife from Hotaru&#39;s hand. Violet eyes 
glared at Rei&#39;s failed attempt at baking. The pan was carried to the 
sink and ran under hot water. This time, the knife cut through the 
&quot;bread&quot; and it was tossed into the garbage can. Hotaru&#39;s glare worsened 
when Rei smirked at her.

&quot;It&#39;s your fault.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re real mature,&quot; Rei teased.

&quot;Argh!&quot;

Hotaru threw her hands into the air and stormed out of the kitchen. The 
miko smirked and continued to chop the vegetables. Seconds later, the 
college student returned, looking pissed.

&quot;Forgot you&#39;re cooking dinner?&quot;

A glare was the only response.

&quot;You&#39;re most definitely feeling better.&quot;

&quot;I told you I wasn&#39;t sick.&quot;

&quot;Right. And the barfing in your sleep was just to scare me and an excuse 
to make me clean up.&quot;

Hotaru turned to discover Rei staring at her intently.

&quot;Did I really throw up?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, only the first night though.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry. You were stuck taking care of me instead of doing... 
well, anything else.&quot;

Hotaru walked over, stopping only centimeters away from Rei. The miko 
felt her heart speed up as her friend leaned forward.

&#39;Oh god,&#39;Hotaru screamed in her mind, &#39;what am I doing? This is way too 
close to Rei!&#39;

The older woman could feel the other&#39;s breath on her neck. A shiver ran 
down her spine as she realized a small hand was brushing against hers.

They just stood there, staring at each other. Hotaru closed her eyes 
slightly, cheeks flushed. How she&#39;s dreamed of a moment like this.

&#39;I could kiss her.&#39;

The thought shocked Rei even before she finished thinking it. She could. 
Oh, could she ever. It would be too easy to lean forward- just a tiny 
bit since they were so close. The smell of vanilla and cherries invaded 
her senses, leaving her nothing more than a puddle of mush. To her 
surprise, she felt the fire within her die down. The heat was replaced 
by a calm, comforting feeling.

Hotaru leaned over further into Rei&#39;s body. It would be so easy to just 
kiss the woman already. They would get lost in the passion. The look of 
hunger in those beautiful eyes was swallowing her whole. She was 
drowning in the need to be together, the need to touch and to hold. She 
could imagine Rei&#39;s lips on her skin, surrounding her body with warmth 
and blazing into her soul in a burst of wild fire. And she would give 
in, letting the miko claim her, mark her and make love to her.

Make love to her but not love her. There was a difference. Rei Hino 
didn&#39;t love her. She only loved two people, both blonde. She loved them 
completely, leaving no room for another. And in the end, Hotaru would 
probably end up on her bed despite knowing this. She would moan and 
pretend the miko loved her. But not matter what, she would just be 
another name on the long list.

&#39;No,&#39;she cried, &#39;don&#39;t do this to yourself! Stop dreaming!&#39;

Rei was barely breathing. She could smell Hotaru&#39;s scent, hear her 
gentle breathing, see her beautiful eyes twinkle and feel her body press 
against her own. Hell, she could practically taste the girl&#39;s mouth as 
she imagined their tongues dance.

Was she a pervert? Yes, she was. This was her friend. One of her best 
friends. She watched her grow from an adorable infant into a cute 
toddler into a wise teenager and into a beautiful woman.

Now she wanted her?

Wanted her the way she&#39;s wanted every other pretty girl or hot guy. She 
wanted to crush her in a tight embrace and to bruise those pink lips. 
She wanted to throw her onto her bed and have her way with her.

She was a monster. To see your friend as another play thing? Was this 
all she was now?

Rei was shaken from her self-disgust when she saw Hotaru&#39;s hand move 
upwards. Her heart hammered. God, was Hotaru offering herself to her? If 
so, would she accept?

Hell yes. In a fraction of a second.

But the lustful thoughts came to a screeching halt when Hotaru reached 
past her head and opened the cupboard behind her. Disappointment coursed 
through Rei&#39;s veins.

God, she was so stupid. Why would Hotaru ever give herself to someone 
like her? All she had to give was sex. Not commitment, not a 
relationship, not love and not even a promise to stay loyal.

No, Hotaru Tomoe deserved much better, much more. She deserved someone 
that would give himself completely to her. And Rei? Everything she was 
belonged to Minako and Usagi. Whatever was left was sealed away, 
especially her heart. Did she even have a heart anymore?

Hotaru tore herself from Rei, the hardest thing she&#39;s ever had to do. 
Taking the salt bottle in her hand, she turned to add it to the chicken 
on the stove.

Rei&#39;s eyes were engraved in her mind. The lust and desire were so 
strong. And they were for her. How she&#39;s dreamed of such a day.

Hotaru always thought that she&#39;d give Rei her all, even if the miko just 
wanted her body. But now, seeing the look in her eyes, she couldn&#39;t.

Because Rei didn&#39;t love her. She never will. The love for the two 
blondes has crushed her, making her a shell of who she once was. Hotaru 
would do anything to change that.

But she knew she couldn&#39;t. The only way to get the old Rei back was for 
Rei herself to let go. She needed to open up and love again.

But who would love someone like Hotaru Tomoe?

They ate dinner in silence. Neither of them had spoken since the 
incident in the kitchen. Somehow, they managed to silently communicate 
everything. Of course, no touching or eye contact involved. Neither of 
them could take it.

Hotaru was trying to get a hold of Haruka, Michiru or Setsuna 
telepathically. No success. She wanted, no, needed them. She needed out. 
She needed to get away from Rei. To see what she wanted but could never 
have was killing her. It would be so easy to give in.

&quot;I have to go to school tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

Silence. Rei wanted desperately for a way to ease the tension.

&quot;Why don&#39;t I drop you off tomorrow?&quot;

Hotaru gulped. No, don&#39;t be nice.

&quot;It&#39;s all right. I can get there by myself.&quot;

&quot;I know you can. But I want to take you. Besides, I&#39;m dropping by my 
office anyway.&quot;

The miko found herself the recipient of one of the college student&#39;s 
famous glares. She relaxed slightly. At least things were somewhat back 
to normal.

&quot;Rei, you&#39;re still sick.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going just to check up on things. I won&#39;t do any work, I promise.&quot;

Hotaru relented with a soft sigh. &quot;All right. I&#39;d love to have a ride.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

Fine, not on best terms again just yet, but much better than before.

&quot;Hotaru? Hotaru! Get up.&quot;

Violet eyes blinked drowsily. Once they opened fully, they focused on 
the woman by her bed. Rei stood there, coffee mug in one hand and a 
phone in the other.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Morning, sleepyhead. You best get up. It&#39;s 7:58.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot;

Hotaru was now completely awake, scrambling for the bathroom. Rei smiled 
and shook her head.

Minutes later, a still sleepy but fast moving Hotaru ran into the dining 
room.

&quot;Something to drink?&quot;

&quot;No, thanks. I need to get to school.&quot;

&quot;All right. Come on.&quot;

Hotaru followed the miko down into the garage.

At 8:25 AM, Rei&#39;s silver Porsche pulled up in front of Tokyo University. 
All eyes turned, admiring the beautiful car. The passenger side door 
opened and out stepped Hotaru Tomoe. She shut the door and ran of the 
base of the stairs, where three girls stood, gawking.

&quot;Hey, guys. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

The brunette Hotaru was pushing away shifted and walked back to the car. 
The blonde and the other brunette followed. Hotaru groaned.

&quot;Hotaru-chan, nice ride,&quot; the shorter brunette whistled.

&quot;Yeah! Did Haruka-san get a new ride?&quot;

&quot;No, Sara. This is my friend&#39;s car.&quot;

All three girls looked at their nervous looking friend and then turned 
their attention back to the car. The driver&#39;s side door opened, causing 
the four girls to step back.

&quot;Staring is a bit rude, ladies.&quot;

None of them knew whether the woman was talking about them staring at 
the car or at her. Either way, Rei was leaning on the hood of her ride, 
an amused smile on her lips. The blonde, Sara, gawked at her.

&quot;W-wh-who...&quot;

&quot;W-what....&quot; the shorter brunette continued.

&quot;Hotaru?&quot;

The girl in question smiled nervously. &quot;Umm... guys, meet Rei Hino. Rei, 
my friends. The blonde&#39;s Sara, the shorter brunette is Megumi and the 
tallest one is Hikari.&quot;

Both Sara and Hikari bowed politely, amusing the smiling miko. Megumi 
offered her hand, which Rei shook. The three college students then 
returned to staring at the woman. She was gorgeous!

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you ladies. Hotaru, here&#39;s a floppy with your report 
on it. I thought you might want it, just in case you wrinkle your report 
or something.&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot;

&quot;I have to hurry to the office now. It was a pleasure meeting you 
ladies.&quot;

Hotaru sighed as her friends just nodded quietly, still in awe. The miko 
smiled and waved as she stepped into her car and drove away.

A few minutes later, Sara turned to a fidgeting Hotaru, smiling sweetly.

&quot;Hotaru, when did you get a girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;What! No! She&#39;s not my girlfriend!&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Sara asked eagerly. &quot;Can I ask her out then?&quot;

&quot;Sara,&quot; Hikari scolded gently.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Megumi said smiling. &quot;I don&#39;t go that way and I have a 
boyfriend, but she&#39;s hot!&quot;

Hotaru stiffened. She turned to her blonde friend, expression grim.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you want to go out with Rei.&quot;

Sara arched a brow in question. &quot;Why? You like her?&quot;

&quot;I knew that was coming,&quot; Hotaru mumbled under her breath. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;

All three college students opened their mouths to say something. But 
Hotaru held up her hand, silencing them.

&quot;But, that&#39;s not the reason I don&#39;t want you going out with her.&quot;

The youngest senshi could tell Hikari and Megumi were getting curious 
and Sara flat out annoyed. She took a deep breath.

&quot;You&#39;ll get hurt,&quot; she whispered so softly that they barely heard her. 
&quot;Rei&#39;s not... loyal. She sleeps around, promising each girl or guy 
forever. But forever doesn&#39;t even last a day, much less weeks.&quot;

None of the girls has ever heard Hotaru in so much pain. Her eyes were 
distant, hands held close to her heart.

&quot;She doesn&#39;t love anymore. She doesn&#39;t care if what she does is hurting 
people.&quot;

Violet eyes turned to Sara, almost knocking the blonde off her feet with 
their intensity.

&quot;Don&#39;t go out with her. I don&#39;t want you to get hurt too.&quot;

&quot;Too?&quot; Megumi echoed, brown eyes darkening. &quot;Did she hurt you?&quot;

&quot;Did she?&quot; Hikari pressed.

Hotaru shook her head, thankful to have so many good (protective, but 
good) friends. She smiled and walked up the stairs.

&quot;Come on, we&#39;ll be late.&quot;

Hotaru walked down the stairs with Hikari, Sara and Megumi. Their finals 
had been easier than they&#39;d expected, but by no means easy. They were 
chatting about the newest movie when Hotaru saw her.

Rei was standing at the bottom of the steps, talking on her cell phone. 
The college student wondered how she can look that beautiful wearing 
just a white blouse and black pants. Her friends noticed her silence and 
followed her gaze. Megumi straightened to her full height, 5&#39;3&quot;, but 
none the less intimidating because of the look in her eyes.

&quot;Parker, I don&#39;t CARE how, I want it done. Yeah, so what! I&#39;ll fly to 
Canada if he doesn&#39;t want to come. All right, do what you can.&quot;

Rei shut the cell phone off, mumbling in annoyance as she turned around. 
She found four college students walking up to her and smiled.

&quot;Oh, hey Hotaru, Megumi, Sara and Hikari.&quot;

Megumi just nodded while Sara and Hikari bowed. Rei&#39;s eyes narrowed 
slightly, why were they being so cold now? Hotaru spoke up first.

&quot;What brings you here?

&quot;When Utena and Kenji found out I was sick this weekend, they demanded I 
go home. But, then I figured today&#39;s your last day of school so I should 
take you and your friends out for lunch.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Hotaru wouldn&#39;t admit it, but she was really touched by Rei&#39;s gesture. 
Megumi, however, just became even more suspicious.

&quot;Do you all want to? I mean, I understand if you have prior 
arrangements,&quot; the miko continued.

The youngest senshi looked at her friends, who all nodded.

&quot;Sure.&quot;

Rei smiled. &quot;Great. There&#39;s a caf&eacute; two blocks from here that Usa-chan 
said... no, more like exclaimed, was pretty good.&quot;

&quot;That sounds like her.&quot;

Rei shook her head as the four college student began walking next to 
her.

&quot;You know her. That bottomless pit knows every restaurant, deli, caf&eacute; 
and fruit stand in city.&quot;

They all cracked a smile, even the sulking Megumi.

&quot;How did you know when we would be out?&quot; Hikari asked, speaking up for 
the first time.

&quot;I called the office and demanded they tell me.&quot;

All four of the students stopped, gaping at her.

&quot;You&#39;re joking,&quot; Sara croaked out, shocked.

Rei chuckled and winked. &quot;Yes, I am. I&#39;ve been waiting out here for 
about half an hour, hoping I didn&#39;t miss you.&quot;

It was clear from the expression on the blonde&#39;s face that she was 
trying not to go &quot;awwww.&quot; Hotaru reached out and touched the miko&#39;s arm, 
causing Megumi&#39;s eyes to flash. She told Sara not to fall for the older 
woman, but it was obvious she herself was falling.

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to. And you don&#39;t have to take us out for lunch, 
either.&quot;

The somewhat cocky expression became a gentle smile. Rei reached over 
and brushed a strand of hair behind her friend&#39;s ear.

&quot;I know. But I want to. I know Ruka-san, Michi-san and Suna-san always 
take you out for dinner. The first two are out of town and who knows 
where Setsuna is. So, you&#39;ll just have to settle for me this time.&quot;

Hotaru looked into Rei&#39;s lavender eyes, her emotions displayed clearly 
for all to see. Her classmates knew now for certain that she didn&#39;t just 
like Hino, she loved her. Something that shocked them senseless.

&quot;I&#39;m not settling. You&#39;re great.&quot;

&quot;Hm... good to know. But, let&#39;s keep walking. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all 
hungry.&quot;

Hotaru snorted as Rei started walking again.

&quot;You want to hurry because you&#39;re hungry.&quot;

The miko turned, flipping her hair over her right shoulder and just 
smirked.

&quot;I never said I wasn&#39;t.&quot;

The girls were sitting in a booth near the back of the caf&eacute;. Megumi sat 
across from Rei, displeased that Hotaru was sitting to Rei&#39;s right and 
Sara on the miko&#39;s left. The blonde and Hikari made sure to pin the 
short brunette between the two of them to get her to behave.

&quot;Please, order whatever you want.&quot;

Megumi opened the menu and tried hard not to gawk. The prices were very 
high. Sara was perfectly at ease, talking about the different selections 
with Rei. The blonde was rich, downright loaded. Hikari didn&#39;t look too 
shocked either, her green eyes scanning the menu.

&quot;Rei.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Hotaru?&quot;

&quot;I appreciate what you&#39;re doing. But it&#39;s just the last day of sophomore 
year. It&#39;s nothing-&quot;

&quot;It is important.&quot;

Hotaru sighed. &quot;No, not really.&quot;

&quot;Ru, it&#39;s fine. We eat at Tower all the time, so I don&#39;t see why this is 
a big deal.&quot;

The Tower, one of the most expensive and classy restaurants in all of 
Tokyo. Megumi knew Hotaru was well off as well, but this was ridiculous! 
She&#39;d have to save her allowance for a year just to get a table there!

Hotaru, noticing Megumi&#39;s stare, blushed. She knew Sara wouldn&#39;t be any 
help judging by the delighted expression on her face. Hikari, however, 
seemed to catch her friend&#39;s distress.

&quot;Hino-san-&quot;

&quot;Rei&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;Rei-san.&quot;

The woman being addressed was clearly amused by Hikari&#39;s manners. 
However, she remained silent and watched as the brunette cast a worried 
glance at Megumi.

&quot;Rei-san, we don&#39;t want to be a bother. We could have enjoyed a 
hamburger or such-&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Rei cut in, smiling. &quot;I have enough money on me to feed 
four college girls.&quot;

The four blushed, reminded of the fact that they were merely college 
students. Hotaru began playing with her napkin, hoping Megumi wouldn&#39;t 
take anything out on Rei. Out of the four, she was the poorest, her 
parents working full time to support her family.

&quot;Besides, I have enough credit cards to pay for the feeding of an army 
of starving teenage boys.&quot;

Megumi shook her head. This was ridiculous. Her parents worked hard to 
send her to college and here the woman with her could pay for twenty 
people&#39;s education. Hotaru and Hikari didn&#39;t flaunt their wealth, since 
they knew she was sensitive when it came to money. Sara wasn&#39;t as 
careful as the other two, but not intentionally to hurt Megumi. It was 
just her lifestyle. And it seemed Rei Hino was exactly like the blonde.

The waitress came and took their orders. Megumi eyed Rei evenly.

&quot;Rei-san, do you mind if I ask how old you are?&quot;

The miko smiled whilst Sara and Hikari wanted to hit their friend for 
her bluntness. Hotaru groaned inward and sank into her seat. And so 
begins the interrogation.

&quot;No, of course not. I&#39;m 25.&quot;

&quot;Six years older than Hotaru. Would you mind if I ask how you two met?&quot;

Hotaru was now ready to pounce on Megumi. Talk about overprotective.

&quot;No. We met because of our common friend, ChibiUsa.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ChibiUsa,&quot; Hotaru cut in. &quot;She lost her hat and I got it back for 
her. We became friends. And through ChibiUsa, I met Rei.&quot;

Talk about a condensed version.

&quot;How old were you then, Rei-san?&quot; Hikari asked, becoming interested as 
well.

&quot;It was eleven years ago, so I was 14.&quot;

&quot;I see. And how did you two become friends? I imagine it&#39;s hard for a 14 
year old and 8 year old to really become friends.&quot;

&quot;Well, Megumi, I was friends with Hotaru&#39;s guardians, all three of them 
in fact.&quot;

&quot;Oh? How old were they then?&quot; Sara asked, oblivious to the nervous look 
on Hotaru&#39;s face.

&quot;Sara!&quot; Hikari cried, though somewhat halfheartedly.

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Hotaru said. &quot;Haruka and Michiru were 16 and Setsuna was 
21.&quot;

Rei looked at Hotaru, arching a brow as if to ask, &#39;So that&#39;s the story 
we&#39;re going by?&#39; The younger senshi nodded and hoped none of her other 
friends read anything from their eyes.

&quot;Wait. They&#39;re not that much older than you,&quot; Sara said suddenly. &quot;How 
did they come to be your guardians? I&#39;ve always been curious.&quot;

It was true. When the three met Hotaru a year ago, the girl told them 
she lived with her guardians. But they never learned how that came to 
be.

Hotaru and Rei&#39;s eyes met again. The former was clearly hesitant to go 
into her past. The miko smiled, her gaze reassuring her that her friends 
wouldn&#39;t judge. Not that it&#39;s the entire story they&#39;d be hearing.

&quot;My father...&quot;

At the word &quot;father,&quot; Hikari, Megumi and Sara perked up. They&#39;ve never 
heard Hotaru talk about her father before.

&quot;My father owned Mugen High school. Haruka and Michiru were students 
there. Since I was usually around the school, my father asked them to be 
my babysitters during school hours.&quot;

The three college students nodded, motioning for Hotaru to continue.

&quot;My father was later in an accident, leaving him unable to care for me. 
Setsuna was a teacher at Mugen, whom my father and I knew well. She was 
Haruka&#39;s guardian and I already loved her like a mother. So, my father 
made her my legal guardian along with Michiru and Haruka, when they 
turned 21.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Sara whispered, saddened by her friend&#39;s story, &quot;they raised you?&quot;

Hotaru nodded. &quot;Yes. Along with Rei, Ami Mizuno, Minako Aino, Usagi 
Tsukino and Makoto Kino.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Megumi asked blinking.

&quot;We know Rei-san,&quot; Hikari stated. &quot;But who are the other four? Wait, did 
you say Ami Mizuno? As in the most renowned doctor in Tokyo at 25?&quot;

Rei laughed, her eyes dancing with mirth as she shook her head. Hotaru 
smiled.

&quot;Oh god,&quot; the miko said, wiping a tear from her eyes. &quot;I want to meet 
one person who doesn&#39;t know who Ami is.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right. If I had a penny for every time I hear someone mention 
her, I&#39;d be rich.&quot;

&quot;You guys have a pretty diverse group of friends,&quot; Megumi said simply, 
though everyone could hear the slightly suspicious tone in her voice.

&quot;Megumi,&quot; the miko said, addressing the brunette. &quot;You remind me of my 
friend, Makoto Kino.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot;

Rei knew she had to approach the subject with care. Megumi was 
practically promising death in her eyes.

&quot;Well, she&#39;s a brunette, first off. And very protective. She&#39;d do 
anything so that her friends won&#39;t be hurt. She&#39;s really tough too. 
Heck, she&#39;s a master of martial arts. And judging by the way you carry 
yourself, you practice it as well.&quot;

Megumi leaned forward slightly, interested. Hino knew more than she 
looked like she did.

&quot;But, she&#39;s really a big softy on the inside.&quot;

Hikari and Sara had to restrain their friend from pouncing on Rei. The 
miko, however, had no fear whatsoever.

&quot;Mako-chan lost her parents when she was young. You have a big family, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;

Rei took the heated stare from the young woman as a yes.

&quot;You both learned how to take care of yourself when you were young. And 
how to take care of others. For you, it&#39;s siblings and for Makoto, it 
was us. But we are like a family. We&#39;re closer than most real families 
since for most of us, we don&#39;t have a very traditional family.&quot;

Megumi stopped, hearing the pain in Rei&#39;s voice. Hotaru closed her eyes 
and leaned against Rei.

&quot;I grew up with my grandfather. Minako&#39;s parents were neglectful. Ami 
lived only with her mother. Haruka didn&#39;t live with her family and never 
discussed them. Michiru was the same. Usagi&#39;s the only one with a real 
family.&quot;

Lavender eyes bore into Megumi&#39;s. The college student almost gasped. 
They burned with an uncontrollable flame. It was both scorching and 
comforting, easily swayed to either side. Rei Hino was as protective of 
Hotaru as she was, no, more. And she cared for her friend.

&quot;We wanted to give Hotaru what most of us didn&#39;t have. Sure, we&#39;re not a 
conventional family. But we tried. And thank god she turned out the way 
she did.&quot;

Hotaru refrained from hugging Rei right there and then. Despite the 
fiery attitude, the miko was still a kind and caring person. And she 
cared about her. God, she cared. The young girl covered her friend&#39;s 
hand with her own, causing the miko to look at her. Rei reached up and 
touched a slightly pale cheek, eyes twinkling.

&quot;Thank god.&quot;

That was all Hotaru could stand. Without a word, she leaned over and 
kissed Rei&#39;s cheek. Lavender eyes closed, relishing the feel of those 
soft lips on her skin.

Three pairs of eyes watched the touching exchange. It was painfully 
obvious the attraction that existed between those two. And it went 
beyond the whole &quot;family&quot; ties they spoke of. For reasons unknown to 
Megumi, Hotaru Tomoe loved Rei Hino. And to her annoyance, those 
feelings seemed to be reciprocated.

And they had no idea of the other&#39;s affection.

The brunette groaned out loud. The two involved in the little drama were 
too busy to notice. Hikari and Sara, however, were not. Two pairs of 
angry eyes turned to the brunette, promising death is she interfered.

&quot;All right, ladies. Sorry to keep you waiting.&quot;

The waitress&#39; arrival snapped Rei and Hotaru from their trance. They 
moved away, blushing. Both pairs of purple eyes turned away from the 
other.

&quot;Who ordered the Supreme Mocha Cara-&quot;

&quot;That would be her,&quot; Rei interrupted, pointing to Hotaru.

Sara was touched by the fact that the miko knew what her friend ordered. 
As the waitress walked away, her brown eyes turned to Rei.

&quot;Rei-san? Did you know that&#39;s what Hotaru ordered since you know her so 
well?&quot;

The older woman felt four pairs of eyes on her. She smiled sweetly, 
though the gleam in her eyes told them she was anything but that.

&quot;I wish,&quot; she whispered, sighing dramatically. &quot;But alas, that is not 
the case.&quot;

&quot;Then how did you know I ordered it? You weren&#39;t paying attention when 
the waitress was getting our orders.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s simple. Only Hotaru would order something with such a long name it 
would take more time to say it than to enjoy it.&quot;

Hikari, Megumi and Sara found it hard not to twitch. Rei, on the other 
hand, was smiling so widely her cheeks hurt. She could feel a pair of 
glaring eyes on her, trying to burn a whole through her head. She turned 
to her right, looking into the annoyed face of Hotaru Tomoe. The miko 
gulped and smiled weakly.

&quot;Rei...&quot;

&quot;Umm... hi, Hotaru.&quot;

The disbelief the other three girls felt disappeared when they saw the 
panic in the business woman&#39;s eyes. The confident woman moved back from 
the youngest senshi.

Hotaru suddenly calmed. Four pairs of eyes stared as she sipped her 
drink. Violet eyes turned to Rei, a smirk on her lips.

&quot;This is from a woman who orders black Colombian coffee every time.&quot;

Attention was refocused on the miko. The three students of Tokyo 
University found the exchange to be amusing.

&quot;What can I say? I&#39;m a creature of habit, Firefly-chan.&quot;

Annoyed violet eyes met smug lavender ones. But, it was obvious Hotaru 
wasn&#39;t about to let Rei get the best of her.

&quot;I find it rather dull, Hino-chan.&quot;

&quot;Yes, perhaps, Firefly-chan. But at least I won&#39;t order a dish cooked 
completely in milk by accident.&quot;

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Sara mumbled. Everyone knew Hotaru hated milk. The short 
black-haired woman opened her mouth to retort when a smooth voice cut 
her off.

&quot;Well, I&#39;d never thought I&#39;d see the day when the Rei Hino is out with 
four college girls. Too young, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot;

Everyone turned to see a tall woman with flaming red hair and mocking 
gray eyes looking at Rei. Her red lips were twisted upwards in a 
condescending smile. Hotaru felt her friend tense besides her.

&quot;Naomi,&quot; the miko greeted coldly.

The woman, Naomi, looked at the college students and stopped when she 
got to Sara.

&quot;Ah, only one girl wouldn&#39;t mind going out with you.&quot; Then she turned to 
Sara. &quot;She&#39;s your type, isn&#39;t she, hon?&quot;

Sara blinked in confusion and turned to Rei for help. The miko glared at 
Naomi before returning her attention to the blonde college student.

&quot;Don&#39;t mind her,&quot; she said dryly. &quot;She can pick up every lesbian or 
bisexual girl within a radius of five miles.&quot;

Megumi and Hikari squirmed uncomfortably as their friend blushed.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be talking, Hino. Your radar&#39;s set for ten.&quot;

Rei stood, ready to pounce on Naomi. The only reason she didn&#39;t was 
Hotaru&#39;s hand on her arm. The redhead&#39;s smirk widened at the sight of 
this.

&quot;Naomi-san!&quot;

A cute and perky young woman bounced over to the booth. Naomi&#39;s eyes 
softened immediately.

&quot;Mika-chan.&quot;

The girl turned to Rei, staring at her. Naomi&#39;s eyes narrowed at the 
sight of the miko&#39;s twinkling eyes.

&quot;Mika-chan, wait for me outside.&quot;

The girl nodded and walked out. Cold gray turned to blazing lavender as 
the miko sat down. The calm before the storm.

&quot;I never thought I&#39;d see this day,&quot; Rei snarled. &quot;The day the famous 
Naomi Nagi falls for a straight girl. Quite smitten over her, actually.&quot;

Naomi&#39;s eyes flashed. She turned and walked towards the door.

&quot;Good day, Hino. This isn&#39;t over.&quot;

The bell over the door sounded when the redhead walked out. All eyes 
turned to Rei. The miko seemed completely unaffected as she sipped her 
coffee.

&quot;Rei-san,&quot; Sara said finally. &quot;Did you know all along I was a lesbian?&quot;

The blonde was blushing furiously and looked down to avoid the twinkling 
lavender eyes. It was obvious from Rei&#39;s gaze both the answer to that 
question and to the next. Nevertheless, Sara decided to ask.

&quot;Did you know I was interesting in you?&quot;

Rei nodded, smiling brightly. Megumi practically jumped out of her chair 
when the miko touched the Sara&#39;s hand.

&quot;Once you have enough experience, it&#39;s easy to tell with most people.&quot;

Hotaru looked away to hide her own blush. Does that mean Rei could tell 
she had a crush... no, that she loved the miko? Hopefully not.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Rei continued as she pulled her hands away, seeing Megumi&#39;s 
glare, &quot;I&#39;m flattered.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know why. You&#39;re gorgeous, I&#39;m sure you have people chasing you 
all the time.&quot;

The miko actually blushed. Hikari noticed both Hotaru and Rei stiffen 
the same time Sara did.

&quot;Yeah, well...&quot;

The group fell into an uncomfortable silence. Soon, lunch was finished, 
yet no one said another word. When it came time to leave, the four 
students stood outside while Rei paid the bill.

&quot;So,&quot; Hikari said to Hotaru as Rei walked out, &quot;are you coming home with 
us, Hotaru?&quot;

The miko stood to the side, waiting for Hotaru&#39;s answer. It was clear 
Megumi disliked her. Sara was... well, Sara. Hikari felt awkward around 
her. Rei sighed and looked at the direction of the university. She 
wanted to make a good impression on Hotaru&#39;s friends. Once again, she 
totally messed something up.

&quot;Actually, I&#39;m staying with Rei.&quot;

Hotaru winced when she saw the shorter brunette&#39;s eyes narrow. The 
dangerous vibes coming from the woman was quite scary. Rei didn&#39;t as 
much as look in their direction, trying her best to give them some 
privacy.

&quot;What? When did this happen?&quot;

&quot;Ru,&quot; Rei said calmly, ignoring Megumi&#39;s exclamation. &quot;I&#39;m going to get 
the car.&quot;

The violet-eyed girl was glad Rei took the hint and left. She sighed and 
turned back to her concerned friends.

&quot;Rei was sick this weekend. I stayed with her and my guardians went out 
of town. Rei offered me a place to stay.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; Megumi screamed again. &quot;That&#39;s not good.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Well... argh!&quot;

&quot;What she means,&quot; Hikari interrupted quickly, &quot;is that we don&#39;t think 
it&#39;s a good idea.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Hotaru! It&#39;s obvious you love her! It&#39;s like putting your head into a 
lion&#39;s mouth! Not the smartest idea!&quot;

&quot;Guys, I know you&#39;re worried. But Rei would never hurt me. Trust me on 
this one.&quot;

Megumi growled and stomped off. Just then, Rei pulled up in her car. 
Hikari and Sara thanked the miko for lunch on both theirs and Megumi&#39;s 
behalf. They gave Hotaru a hug before running off. The young woman got 
into the car, upset. Rei sighed and drove home.

Hotaru walked into the apartment, put her stuff down and went straight 
to the guest bedroom. Rei sighed and walked into the kitchen to get some 
water.

Today and last night had not gone well. She needed advice. She needed...

Without another thought, she crossed over to the phone and dialed a 
number. The phone rang twice before it was answered.

&quot;Hi, Setsuna?&quot;
