<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>School had just  finished for the day. Now I was on the bus and on my way back over to  the shrine. Looking back down onto the piece of paper I continued my  writing.</p>
<p><em>I hope Rei isn’t mad…Forgetting to call  might’ve not been a great idea. It was just that I was worrying  about a few other stressing matters. I mean, learning that some  special secret technology actually did exist when I was told it  didn’t, being attacked by a demonic garden hose, meeting my parents  indirectly and finally, using my powers for the second time in my  life.</em></p>
<p>I paused.</p>
<p><em><br />
  All  I’m left with is a bunch of questions; I don’t understand  anything. Where did the monster come from, why did it attack Hisa and  what on earth was that crystal thing that came out of her chest? It  doesn’t make any sense! Plus a monster…some psycho woman and my  parents were all there. Is a crystal really so important that would  make everyone go after it? </em></p>
<p>Hmm…One of my  hands came up to my chin as I attempted to think things through. The  sounds of the bus’s motor were blocked from my mind but try as I  might I wasn’t able to ignore tiny vibrations that softly shook the  seats. A small irritation compared to a few stares of interest  amongst the group of passengers. I sighed quietly and shook my head.  All right, so what <em>do</em> I know? With my free hand I outstretched  its index finger. First of all it seems that Hisa doesn’t remember  the incident at all. Secondly…My middle finger accompanied the  index. It appears that there hasn’t been another attempt to steal  the older girl’s crystal. Does that mean they’ve given up or are  they merely waiting for the right time for a round two?</p>
<p>“Hey  blondie!” Someone whistled and snapped me out of my thoughts.</p>
<p>My head shot up and my senses were alert. Haruka was here?  Since when did the proud blond take the bus? I always imagined the  woman to be racing around the city in a motorcycle or at the very  least, a car of her own. To my relief I found it was some lame  pervert trying to hit on me. At times I forget that I’m a blond as  well. Whew…</p>
<p>“Not interested.” I coldly stated.</p>
<p>“Aww,  what do you mean? Can’t we just…” With that I shot him a glare  and the man immediately shut up. Seems he got the message.</p>
<p>I waited a few more minutes before I was sure that there  would be no more interruptions.</p>
<p>The thing was, I  was really glad Haruka wasn’t here or Michiru either for that  matter. Yesterday all of their questions had me right on the spot, it  really bothered me to lie to them as they were the closest people I  had for friends. They truly did seem to be worried for my health but  it’s not worth burdening them with troubles that do not concern  them. Heck, I felt myself laugh inside, since when did it concern me?  Besides the fact that my parents were there and it was Hisa that was  attacked the whole demon business was beyond my agenda. I froze. Or  was it…? Something like a little voice at the back of my head was  nagging.</p>
<p>‘<em>The sailor scout’s powers were meant to  fight for peace against the forces of evil /’ </em>I had memorized  this phrase after hearing it countless of times. But there was more  to it. Queen Serenity and her guardians all fought time after time  until the era of Crystal Tokyo came, that much I knew from the  textbooks. I closed my eyes at the reminiscence.</p>
<p>Reading, writing notes, flipping through the computerized crystal  documents hours at a time when I had not been training. A small desk  in a gigantic library and a rug under my feet as I sat in a leather  armchair. The whole room was completely lit up as the light from the  ceiling fell to the clear tiles below and was reflected back up in  all directions. Many times I watched recorded battles on the pages as  instructed by my older sister. If there was an interesting or unique  strategy I was to write it down on my notebook, then describe the  pros and cons that occurred as well as the initial risks. I also  recall the mountain of pages used for each fight and my hands would  always be sore for some days following.</p>
<p>I  smiled at the memory although back then, I wouldn’t have laughed;  it was too painful. I haven’t studied for awhile now but even  without the books and papers my mind could bring up the memorable  few. Times where sailors had combined attacks, or when two certain  partners had brought down youma with their team work alone.</p>
<p>My  eyes opened to view the bus’s environment again. The sailor  soldiers were considered heroines, living legends. They used their  powers to fight evil…As I do have my parent’s powers am I  expected to fight monsters as well, even if it were not my own  time?</p>
<p><em>No!</em> A voice in my head argued  stubbornly. ‘<em>That’s just ridiculous</em>’. Right I found  myself agreeing. Mainly because I’m not supposed to even exist here  right now and besides, people here have to deal with matters on their  own. That last time with Hisa was an exception that’s all.</p>
<p>Out  of the corner of my eye I noticed the familiar area of town. I can  finish this later, I thought as I dumped the small book into my bag.  My stop had come and I exited off the bus. The mechanical beast  roared away, becoming quieter as I made my way up the steps to where  I stayed. Breathing fresh air now felt so good, just what I needed.  It was even sweeter since Haruka and Michiru weren’t around; I  managed to avoid talking to them all day except when <em>absolutely</em> necessary. Who knows what they would’ve asked if given the chance.  Since this morning I could tell that something had changed between us  but I couldn’t describe what. The atmosphere around them was tense  I had noticed. Just what was I supposed to do? Tell them Hisa and I  were attacked by monsters and make them think I’m in need of some  shrink? I’m so sure it would make them feel better.</p>
<p>“Rei?”  I called upon reaching the entrance of the shrine.</p>
<p>My bag was  swung over my right shoulder with my right hand clutching it. Calling  the miko’s name whenever I returned was becoming a habit to  me.</p>
<p>“She’s not here right now, can I help you?”</p>
<p>A  scruffy long -haired man came into my sight. Brown hair, wearing the  male shrine’s tradition clothing…</p>
<p>“You must be  Yuuchiro.” It was more of a statement than a question.</p>
<p>“Huh?  How’d you know who I am?” He approached closer to get a better  look at me. “Correct me if I’m mistaken miss but I don’t think  we’ve met before.”</p>
<p>HUH? I blinked. Didn’t Rei and her  gramps tell this dude about me yet? They had all yesterday!</p>
<p>“No,  we haven’t.” I smiled. “I’m Kaiya, nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>The  other man stood there, unmoving. If those bangs weren’t in his face  maybe I’d be able to see his eyes I cursed. A person’s emotions  could be better seen with eye contact, it was a rule of life. To my  surprise his body was shaking slightly…was he okay?</p>
<p>“So  you’re the one!” He shouted all of the sudden, catching me off  guard. “Rei said I had been replaced by some handsome tall blond!  But…but…” The way he waved an accusing finger at me was really  irritating.</p>
<p>“A girl?” I finished for him. Remind me to  kill Rei later.</p>
<p>“Uhh…yeah.” The guy blushed and  scratched his head in an embarrassed manner. “So…are you really  replacing me?” He whispered.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!” Came a shriek, two  arms wrapped themselves around my waist from behind.</p>
<p>“Hi  Rei.” Just by the shriek I could identify the smaller girl a mile  away, it really was in a class of its own.</p>
<p>“Where’ve you  been? Grandpa and I was worried about you when you didn’t come home  yesterday.” She released her hold and studied my face.</p>
<p>“Some  things happened, so I ended up staying at Michiru’s place. Sorry I  didn’t call you, it won’t happen again.” I smiled. Rei seemed  to relax and apparently forgot about the whole incident right there  with my gesture. Haruka has some useful moves after all.</p>
<p>“Well  I’m glad you’re back.” She took hold of my free arm and pressed  her side against it.</p>
<p>“Grr…”</p>
<p>“Something wrong  Yuuchiro?” Obviously the guy was jealous but I pretended to be  naïve.</p>
<p>“Rei…” He somewhat managed to reply.</p>
<p>“Oh,  hi Yuuchiro. This is Kaiya, your replacement.” I gave Rei a  questioning look; I thought it was a joke. She gave a wink and  confirmed the suspicion.</p>
<p>“WHAT?” He yelped. Yuuchiro’s  jaw was so wide it could’ve hit the floor as the rest of him paled  significantly. I surpressed a laugh at his reaction.</p>
<p>“You  heard me. We needed some real help around here and Kaiya just  happened to be available. She does all the chores faster and better  than you too.”</p>
<p>I do? But I haven’t done any…Uh oh, why  am I sensing like I’m getting dragged into something here. I tried  to escape the situation but Rei tightened her hold on my arm and dug  her nails painfully into my hand, bare flesh screamed.</p>
<p>“Is  that so?” The man growled in a challenging way. His bangs parted  slightly so I could now see the fierce glare.</p>
<p>Deeeeefinately  not a good feeling. It wasn’t that I was afraid of the man I mean,  first of all I’ve been training all of my life and not just the  princess lessons. Secondly, chores were nothing to me. Third and most  obvious to me of course was I had powers that could blow him across  to the other side of town if I wanted to…not that I’d use my  powers for something so pitiful though.</p>
<p>“Well I challenge  you for my spot back! I’ll prove to Rei that I’m the better  person for the job!”</p>
<p>“Eh?” I was really hoping Rei would  step in and say it was all a joke. About now would be very good.  However when I turned towards her she had already let go of my arm  and was now running back down the shrine steps. “Rei!” I called.  Get back here!</p>
<p>“I’m going to Usagi’s! Seems like she  wants some love advice so catch you guys later!” She threw a kiss  and then waved before she jogged away out of sight.</p>
<p>Well…this  wasn’t good. I scratched the back of my head. Now what to do, I’m  stuck with a VERY jealous man who wants to do nothing more but  strangle me for doing nothing. What do to…</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m  talking to you!” Yuuchiro gasped. Seems like he needs to recover  from all that shouting.</p>
<p>“I heard you. I just need to go put  my bag away, I’ll be right back shortly.” I brushed past him.  “Besides, it looks like you need to take a few deep breaths tough  guy.”</p>
<p>He didn’t retaliate with more threats and allowed  me to go to my room. Guess that’s settled…These little challenges  were no fun at all; I have no doubt in my mind that I’ll be able to  outdo this guy in any ‘challenge’ he brings up. As for him trying  to impress Rei…well she isn’t going to be around to watch so it  would be pointless for him too. Maybe when I go back out I’ll offer  to do it another time, or even better, if we could drop it  altogether. I’d hate to embarrass the poor guy more after what Rei  did to him. No one deserved <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>I dropped my bag to  the floor and stood there for a moment. No, I don’t think the  shrine uniform should be dirtied from such childish acts.</p>
<p>“Perhaps  I’ll change into some ‘casual’ wear.” I eyed the few pieces  of clothing in my dresser. Mostly what Rei had given me, but they are  really girly or too small. The sight of countless of skirts sent  dreaded shivers down my spine. Only for school did I really endure  the torture.</p>
<p>My hands went rummaging through a hidden section  in my bag until…</p>
<p>“Aha!” I beamed. Michiru had lent me a  set of clothing to replace the one I had ‘destroyed’ as Haruka  called it from yesterday. ‘T-shirt and a pair of jeans’ was what  she called them. Although, I was pretty sure it was a sort of peace  bribe because of yesterday and to stimulate conversation, it was  still a nice gesture. I pulled on the denim blue, soft material. The  pants fit somewhat tight and the white t-shirt was bearable.</p>
<p>Hmm…Oh  right, I was thinking about Yuuchiro. It might just be better to tell  him Rei was joking myself but…I frowned, would he believe me?  Probably not since <em>I am</em> technically the stranger.</p>
<p>Finally  all set to go I opened the door to my room to see Yuuchiro seated on  the floor right outside. He jumped up and turned to face me as the  door swung fully open.</p>
<p>“What took you so long?” The man  grunted.</p>
<p>Summing it up the best I could I replied,</p>
<p>“I’m  a girl.” That seemed to answer his question. “Listen Yuuchiro  this whole contest isn’t necessary-“</p>
<p>“Ah-ha! So you’re  afraid!”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. You see Rei was-“</p>
<p>“Don’t  say her name like you know her! Just you watch, once I win she’ll  forget all about you.”</p>
<p>Was this guy really serious? I’ve  never seen anyone act this way before; he must have it bad for Rei.</p>
<p>“You’re are being very unreasonable.” My hand lifted to  my head to lean on.</p>
<p>“No more talk, let’s do this. I’m  itching to go.” Yuuchiro put his fists up in a mock battle  stance.</p>
<p>I sighed in defeat. Kami… I’m still tired from  yesterday’s challenge. I hope this doesn’t happen too often.  Honestly people in this time are maniacs.</p>
<p>“Fine, you choose  the chore.”</p>
<p>“Great, floor cleaning!” Yuuchiro pointed to  two buckets full of soaped up water on the ground. Two sponges  floated on the water’s surface, partially hidden by their foam  camouflage. “I’m the champ at this one.”</p>
<p>I pictured my  back breaking like a twig. Anything but this would’ve been  fine.</p>
<p>“Great champ, you can start us off.”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, Michiru and Haruka during a car ride</u></p>
<p>“What do  you think Michi?” I asked my companion.</p>
<p>“Hmm…It does  seem that Kaiya’s been avoiding us today, hasn’t it?”</p>
<p>It  was true. The girl had been very good at evading any conversation  between Michiru and myself. How much did she see? Did she know? If  she did, it could be a problem…Damn, just what was she  hiding!</p>
<p>“We’ve got to find out.” I voiced my thoughts.</p>
<p>“But haven’t we been trying Haruka? It could be that  she’s still shaken up from the incident…that is, if she really  remembers it at all. Any normal human would clam up until they’ve  calmed down, it’s natural.” Michiru pointed out the  logic.</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“You were exactly like her after <em>your</em> first youma encounter as well.”</p>
<p>That statement  brought back memories of my own. When I had first decided to become  Sailor Uranus I was quite aloof from everyone for a few days as well.  Perhaps I really was thoughtless.</p>
<p>“All right, so what do you  suggest we do?” I felt myself sigh. Michiru always seemed to know  what to do, at times it made me feel rather stupid and needy. I  didn’t blame the other woman for my automatic self-hate; rather, my  self-loathing came from my reckless attitude. At times I wished  Michiru would kick me for it but it would be even worse to embarrass  the shorter woman for becoming involved in my own childish antics.</p>
<p>“Wait it out. She’ll tell us when she’s ready.” The  ocean senshi replied casually. It was as though she had it all  planned out. Man, do I feel stupid. “Here is good Haruka.”</p>
<p>I  parked the car and the both of us made our way into a park. One word,  beautiful. The grass seemed to be kept tidy by a caretaker and the  playground at the entrance was bristling with children already.  Looking at the little tykes, the clumsy movements and excited  high-pitched speeches I couldn’t help but chuckle. As a child, even  back when I was a kid, I couldn’t remember laughing or having so  much fun as these kids were now. It was a case of being always…too  busy. Unconsciously my eyelids lowered halfway, staring longingly.  They were lucky to have friends.</p>
<p>A small tug at my uniform  sleeve reminded me that I had someone now. I had Michiru. Looking  down into her face I could see concern swimming in those aqua eyes  and for some reason, it made it happy when it should’ve made me sad  for worrying the woman.</p>
<p>“I’m all right. Where to next?”  I took her hand into mine, telling her that I’d follow if she’d  lead. Michiru paused for a moment until I had smiled reassuringly to  her. “Really…it’s okay.”</p>
<p>Michiru nodded her head and  pulled me forwards towards a small shrine by the lake. The sparkling  water had caught my eye first; the way the light gleamed off its  clear surface. Unintentionally I found myself stopping to cover my  eyes from the glare. Perhaps I should’ve brought my  sunglasses.</p>
<p>“Ah, you’re back again?”</p>
<p>An old man  feeding some pigeons had addressed Michiru. He sat on one of the many  benches in the sitting area by the lake. However I found myself not  staring at the birds that crowded his legs nor the odd mustache on  his face but his hands. True there was a small bag of birdseed  grasped lightly in those thin, bony fingers but the skin appeared so  callused. Growing old is a part of life isn’t it? What was this man  like when he was younger?</p>
<p>I always wondered what  it would be like to grow old. Just imagine, not being able to do  things you could as a youth; always hanging out with friends, eating  what you wanted, being able to perform strenuous activities such as  running…But that’ll stay forever as a mere imagination, for  sailor senshi will never grow old. We can die but never age. Even  then, it does not mean we should take our eternal youth for  granted.</p>
<p>“Hai, I wanted to finish a painting.” Michiru  smiled.</p>
<p>“Oh I see.” The elder nodded. “And who is this?  Your boyfriend?” He turned to face me with an odd twinkle in his  eye. Immediately I could feel a blush of embarrassment creep to my  face at the mention. I could never get used to this question, no  matter how many times it was asked by random strangers.</p>
<p>“I…er…”  Immediately I looked over to Michiru, hoping she’d answer the  question for me. Instead, she remained silent and decided to watch me  sweat this one out for myself. Okay, well I was definitely sweating!  What to say, what to say…Think smart. I racked my brains for a cool  answer until…Got it.</p>
<p>“Actually yes.” I  replied with confidence. In the corner of my eye I could see Michiru  raise an eyebrow. Now she’s going to get it. A voice in my head  egged me on. <em>‘Embarrass her’</em>.</p>
<p>“You two make a  perfect couple…” The senior responded again. I bet he was  jealous. “How long have you’ve been going out?” Gah, most  questions! No one told me there would be a pop quiz.</p>
<p>“Few  years…” Close enough I mentally shrugged.</p>
<p>“Impressive;  most kids your age don’t last a few months!” He chuckled. “Well  I’ll say one thing for sure, she’s something special there young  man.” With a wave of a hand he then motioned for me to move closer.  “Don’t let this one get away if you know what I mean.” I found  him whispering into my ear. “You also have my blessing.”</p>
<p>I  was definitely dying of embarrassment now.</p>
<p>“I’ll  do my best.” I chuckled before moving away from the amusing  senior.</p>
<p>Walking back over to Michiru I gave her my best  smile, determined to make the old man’s day, perhaps year.</p>
<p>“Haruka  what did he…? Ah-“ She squeaked in surprise.</p>
<p>I had  wrapped my arms around her and planted a kiss on those luscious lips.  The way her body was pressed into mine sent a knee-buckling jolt  through my stomach. Michiru’s arms hanged loosely by her sides, one  hand gripped stubbornly onto her art supplies. For a moment she  continued to allow me to kiss her wide eyed, letting it all happen.  No resistance whatsoever to my surprise, however, I received a bigger  shock when she closed her eyes and started to kiss me back. It was  shyly at first the way she massaged my lips with her own but  gradually picked up. In the background I could hear the faint sound  of art supplies hitting the ground as arms wrapped around me,  returning the embrace in full. She sighed in my mouth,</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>It  was as though I died and gone to heaven. However all good things must  come to an end, can’t make too much of a scene in case someone we  know sees us. Just as Michiru flicked her tongue against my bottom  lip I pulled back.</p>
<p>A look of disappointment lit her features  as we parted. Was she really disappointed I asked myself; I was  breathing too hard to ask Michiru personally.</p>
<p>“Oh ho ho…”  The old man finally replied. “Well, good luck with your painting  young lady. Good luck with the young lady young man.” He gave a  small wink and picked up his cane, walking away to the park’s  entrance.</p>
<p>In silence Michiru and I continued down the hill to  the shore of the small lake. I can’t believe it; I got to kiss  Michiru! And more surprising, she didn’t try to kill me! Inside I  felt all giddy, very unlike me but I couldn’t help it, the feeling  of the kiss was still on my lips.</p>
<p>We found a place and sat  down beneath the shade of a few trees.</p>
<p>“Haruka…” The  aqua haired goddess finally spoke, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>“Yeah…?”  Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm. Stay calm damn it!</p>
<p>“What  did that old man tell you?” There was a dangerous edge to her voice  now. In Michiru’s words, ‘it was an ominous sign’ the way she  her back remained facing me.</p>
<p>“That…I uhh…shouldn’t let  you get away?” I found myself grinning sheepish. That was when I  let my guard down.</p>
<p>“And then you…you…” It hadn’t  quite sunk in with her. The next thing that happened took me by  surprise although it shouldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>Slap!</strong></p>
<p>“Oww…”  My hand reached up to the bright hand print marring my cheek. She hit  me hard…that hurt. I pouted inwardly. “Oh well, can’t win them  all…” I whispered to myself, feeling like smiling despite the  blow.</p>
<p>“What did you say?” Michiru muttered coolly.</p>
<p>“Nothing!” I waved my hands. However she still refused to  look at me.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry okay Michi? I thought it would be  best to make it look believable right? Besides, you shouldn’t have  let me decide on that question; with me being reckless person and  all.” I tried to cheer her up. Still no response…Time to change  tactics; can’t have my partner refuse to talk to me again. Could  cripple our teamwork in battle right? Plus I won’t be able to pass  Modern Japanese without her tutoring! Quickly I taunted with a, “Come  on, you know you liked it.”</p>
<p>I moved closer to the shorter  girl and walked around her side to get a better look at her  face.</p>
<p>“Ah!” I opened my mouth wide in  shock.</p>
<p>“Haruka!”</p>
<p><strong>SLAP! Tumble, Splash.</strong></p>
<p>“Tch…”  A growl escaped my chattering lips. Back a few meters away, out in  the sun I found myself drying off as Michiru decided to start  painting. Who could have thought she could slap harder than last  time? Thanks to that I fell in the lake, bleh, I made a face. Hope I  don’t smell like fish, or wait, are there even fish in this lake?  The questions kept building upon the previous, making my head  slightly spin. No, more important matters first! I shook my head. On  the bright side I’ve learned a lesson today- note to self ‘she  can slap with both hands’. The pain in both of my cheeks agreed  with the statement.</p>
<p>Although my face was burning I still  doubt it was enough to compare to Michi’s. Her face was blood red  and thoroughly flushed…Michiru had looked as if she were dying from  embarrassment. Could she have feelings for me? My memory trailed back  to the kiss, then the painful slaps. No, the two didn’t add up so  that couldn’t be it. Must’ve been in the moment sort of thing. I  leaned back against the grass, allowing the sun to continue its work.  It felt so good, the warmth. My eyes closed gently allowing myself to  be carried away to a hopefully pleasant dream.</p>
<p><u>Few  hours later</u></p>
<p>A few hours had passed. I had awakened  only after the first hour. Besides sleeping, any other time where I  was stationary too long really irked me, not that I didn’t like the  scenery or anything but I hate being bored. For the last half-hour  I’ve been shifting positions constantly by any means possible,  siting up, lying down, climbing the trees…anything! It was driving  me crazy.</p>
<p>“How’s the painting going Michi?” I tried to  casually draw information. Maybe she’s almost done?</p>
<p>“Not  bad, I think I’m almost done.” She continued to move the brush  across the water portion of her sketch.</p>
<p>“Great!” I punched  the air.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, it looks great!” I  recovered just in time. That was a close one, whew.</p>
<p>“ You’ve  been quite mischievous lately Haruka.” Michi stated as she added  finishing touches to her portrait.</p>
<p>“Well it’s been so  boring around here, things need spicing up.” My hands gripped the  back of my head as I sighed. It felt like this day had gone of  forever… “Hey, I’m just going for a bit of a walk. I’ll be  right back Michi.”</p>
<p>Michiru for the most part ignored me and  continued on with her painting. Honestly that girl can get so wrapped  up work, it’s scary sometimes. But…it’s still better than  having her fight all the time that’s for sure. I turned to get one  last glimpse of her before I continued up the hill.</p>
<p><em>You’ve  been quite mischievous lately Haruka.</em> Hmm…I could still hear  her words clear as crystal. This city really does need some life to  it and not the monster type either. In fact, now that I think about  it… the most interesting that ever has happened was Kaiya when  showed up. The brat is quite an enigmatic person…What’s her story  I wonder. The teen doesn’t talk about herself much… AND she  avoided me all day today! A feeling of anger surged up inside me. Why  do I feel like this? If it were Michiru I’d be most likely begging  for forgiveness for whatever it was I did but…</p>
<p>“Ouchy…”  Someone groaned.</p>
<p>“Huh?” While passing by a tree I thought  I heard someone moan in pain. “Hey, anyone up there?” I stopped  to look up into the leafy foliage. There was no audible answer other  than the cracking of the branches, groaning under some heavy,  invisible weight. What if it was? Caution braced me as I jumped back  ready to attack if necessary. I watched the tree shake again.</p>
<p>“Woah!” Someone yelled.</p>
<p>I twitched seeing the  shadowy form as it made itself visible. Now what was the word?  Irritation…there we go.</p>
<p>“What are you doing…hanging  upside down in a tree Kaiya?” To imagine I was scared even for a  moment…”Well?” I demanded with crossed arms. The girl was  dangling with only her two legs grasping the sturdy branches. Her  hair shot downwards as was the blood in her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Er…”  The blonde tried to speak. On the bright side, she can’t run off  now.</p>
<p>“You know, you look like a monkey. Where’re you  hiding your tail?” I stepped forward, pretending to look for the  missing piece.</p>
<p>“Grr…” Kaiya growled.</p>
<p>“I see…”  Up closer now I could see it quite clearly. It wasn’t that she  wanted to be in the position, her pant legging had caught in a crack  of the bark. “Want some help?” I offered, knowing exactly what  she’d say.</p>
<p>“No way!” She struggled, attempting to pull  herself up. To my amusement she had made it up for the most part but  failed to unhook the clothing before she fell down again. “Gah!”  She swung back and forth, with such grace that would’ve made a  pendulum envious might I add.</p>
<p>“Mommy, look at the monkey!”  A small child cried out, pointing at Kaiya. I hadn’t noticed the  mother and son until now. His mother didn’t look quite as  impressed.</p>
<p>“That’s not a monkey dear…you shouldn’t  call people bad names.” She lightly scolded the boy.</p>
<p>Kaiya’s  face looked as though a bucket of red paint had been dumped upon her  mug.</p>
<p>“Don’t say it…” She threatened, narrowing her  eyes into mere slits as she glared.</p>
<p>I shrugged, trying not to  laugh out loud. “Here.”</p>
<p><strong>Whup!</strong></p>
<p>Kaiya fell  with a squeak. Unfortunately she avoided falling on that thick head  of hers, I’m sure the rear end hurts a lot more.</p>
<p>“You  shouldn’t surprise people like that!” The blonde yelled.</p>
<p>“What,  no thank you? And you’re the one to talk.”</p>
<p>“That was an  accident, you meant to do that on purpose!”</p>
<p>“So what if I  did? Rather be stuck up that tree forever?”</p>
<p>Uh  oh, the silent treatment. Wait… where does this look familiar? I  paused for a moment hoping the thought would click. Nope, nada  and…zip.</p>
<p>“Come on, you know you deserved it. Now stop  being a brat.”</p>
<p>Kaiya turned her back to me, not even a  glare this time. You know things are bad when…</p>
<p>“Hey…”  A piece of parchment caught my eye. “What’s this on your  back?”</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>A small piece of paper had been  statically attached to the shorter girl’s shirt. Wonder what it  could be?</p>
<p>“Lovers’ Park: Affection Contest?” The words  jumped out. I raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>That had caught her  attention.</p>
<p>“Say what?” She peeked over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“I  didn’t know you were a romantic. Who’re you going with?” I  teased. However if this had been stuck on her back I doubt she’d  actually have anything to do with it.</p>
<p>“I don’t get it.”  She frowned.</p>
<p>“What?” I faked shock. “You mean you’re  going with someone to the event but you don’t know what it is?”  My eyes went wide, hoping to emphasize the brilliant acting  skills.</p>
<p>“You know, you’re starting to annoy me.”</p>
<p>“That  so?” I chucked. “Well, do you honestly don’t know what it is?”</p>
<p>She nodded, trying extremely hard not to look curious in the  least bit.</p>
<p>“It’s an affection contest, duh.” I waved a  hand in her face. “You know, where couples prove their ‘friendship’  for each other…but its actually a love contest.”</p>
<p>“You  deduced this by?”</p>
<p>“By reading the page.”</p>
<p>There  was a brief silence.</p>
<p>“Are you going?” Kaiya asked  suddenly.</p>
<p>“What? Yeah right, like who’d go with me?” I  laughed.</p>
<p>“I thought that would be obvious. Michiru!”</p>
<p>“M-Michiru? N-no, I don’t think so.” I stuttered,  trying to hide the blush of the thought.</p>
<p>“Why not? Did you  ask her yet?”</p>
<p>“Well no…but…”</p>
<p>“You like her  don’t you?” Ah crap, <em>must</em> stop blushing!</p>
<p>“What’s  with all the questions!” I shouted; hoping the subject would  change. Scratch that, silently begging it to change. “I don’t  know what you’re talking about!” My arms crossed over my  chest.</p>
<p>“That proves it, you do like her.” The statement  was like an arrow had stabbed me through the chest. It was wrenching  my insides painfully. Have…to…keep this to a  minimum…damage.</p>
<p>“Shh!” I cupped a hand over her mouth.  “Don’t tell anyone!” Kaiya was grinning now. “I-It’s just  that I don’t think she feels the same way, who knows, she may be  disgusted if she knew I really felt that way about her. Besides, its  not exactly considered…normal in society.” I breathed, feeling  the sudden urge to curse.</p>
<p>“Not normal?”</p>
<p>“You  know…same gender couples…” I whispered into her  ear.</p>
<p>“Seriously?” The blonde replied in surprise. Upon  hearing this she frowned for a moment, already you could see the  gears spinning in that head of hers. “You sure about  this?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.” I shuddered. There were just some  memories that needed to be forgotten and this topic wasn’t  helping.</p>
<p>Kaiya was now looking at me up and down.</p>
<p>“What  is it?”</p>
<p>“You know you don’t dress like a girl. So people  won’t be able to tell.”</p>
<p>“Yeah well…you know why.”  The thought of binding my breasts stuck out in my head. Major reason  right there!</p>
<p>“But what if Michiru thinks I’m going to  proclaim some hidden love or whatever?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that what  you want to do?”</p>
<p>“No! I-I mean…I don’t know.” So  much thinking… “Maybe…” I pouted. My thoughts were wandering  back to remember Michi and her painting. The way her movements were  pure grace as she brushed with lengthy strokes of colored paint. In  my mind I could slow these movements down, savoring the relaxing  masterpiece one frame at a time. Sunlight accompanied her dance as  random splashes lit up the small shade she worked in. It wasn’t the  ocean but it was still a home to her.</p>
<p>“You’re thinking  about her aren’t you?” The voice interrupted the mental  images.</p>
<p>Re-focusing my vision I realized that I must’ve  been very dazed for Kaiya to be smirking the way she was now. I  really started to regret ever wanting to converse with this person.</p>
<p>“Course not!”</p>
<p>“Course, meaning a positive or  agreeing word. You said that first. Just like an open book.”</p>
<p>“Now  listen-“</p>
<p>“No, you listen.” She interrupted me. A serious  look plastered on her face suddenly, “This is a great opportunity!  Either you take it or you don’t but whatever you decide to do, make  sure you’re committed to the decision all the way.” Was this  really Kaiya? My ears could hardly believe the mature attitude she  took on; a moment ago she had been completely a child. “If you’re  so worried about Michiru suspecting you’re feelings, say you want  to do it as a prank or something like that. She’d believe it, I  mean, you are prone to such behaviors.”</p>
<p>“Haruka…”</p>
<p>“H-huh? Oh! Yeah, prank…right, I get what you’re  saying.”</p>
<p>“That’s good.” The girl fell back against the  grass and proceeded to look up with a spacious gaze at the sky.</p>
<p>“But  just one more thing.”</p>
<p>“ …What is it?” She hesitated to  say for a moment. In my excitement I might’ve been more aware of  the odd answer but I continued on with the question.</p>
<p>“Why <em>were</em> you in the tree in the first place?”</p>
<p>The blonde  blinked. A confused expression washed over her features as her brows  furrowed in deep thought.</p>
<p>“You know…I think I  forgot.”</p>
<p>“You…forgot…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah but I’m  sure I’ll come to me sooner or later.”</p>
<p>“KAAAAAIYA!” A  male voice shouted.</p>
<p>“Oh! I remember now.” Kaiya jumped up.  “I have to go now, poor Yuuchiro is probably looking for me. Talk  to you later Haruka and good luck with Michiru.”</p>
<p>She gave  me a light elbow in the arm and ran off. Distantly I could still hear  the same male voice screaming something along the lines of, ‘When I  get my hands on you I’ll…’</p>
<p>“And everyone calls me the  troublemaker.” I sighed. It was at that moment it hit me that I  forgot to ask the blonde about the youma incident! Aww, crap! A  perfectly good opportunity wasted…damn. I pivoted on the spot and  kicked the tree we were positioned beside during our  chat.</p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p>“Ouch!” How stupid I must’ve  looked jumping on the spot holding my foot.</p>
<p>Coincidentally  the same little boy and mother came strolling around the corner again  just then.</p>
<p>“Mommy, look at the-“</p>
<p>“Don’t say  it.” I glared at the kid. Just when the brat was going to cry his  mother pulled at his hand hurriedly away from me. Now that’s over  with…I guess I should ask Michiru.</p>
<p>I trudged back slowly  ever carefully thinking of the exact words I’d say. It had to be  perfect as anything could go wrong the way the situation was. Would I  start by saying I want to play a prank? Or maybe I could just  surprise her and see what she thinks first. Either way, it could be a  good laugh. Unconsciously my hands were fumbling together, slightly  damp from sweat of my nervousness. The possibility of even going on a  remote date with Michiru made the butterflies in my stomach flutter.  Even if it was a fake outing…Ah! Shouldn’t get too ahead of  myself, she has to say ‘yes’ first.</p>
<p>Halfway down the  hill, just a little further to go, I told myself. That was…until  something had made my blood boil and freeze at the same time. From  here I could make out a shape of another man talking to the beautiful  sea goddess. They seemed to be laughing, having a good time.  Automatically my hands clenched painfully into tight fists. They were  shaking in unison as I could feel my entire body tremble. I wanted to  kick his retarded ass. Who knows what he’s planning to do, you  can’t trust some stranger. Never once did the thought that I was  jealous click into my mind.</p>
<p>For a few more heart wrenching  minutes passed. I had trouble breathing, even standing still was  difficult; a part of me wanted to run away from the scene while  another wanted to release the violent strength I desperately tried to  hold back.</p>
<p>“Go away…” I whispered, wishing the man  would leave and end the torturous feelings that had invaded my  psyche. The scene was bringing back memories…A man and a woman  chatting pleasantly by a large water fountain. They looked happy but  their voices were giving way to argument.</p>
<p>“Ah!” I gasped.  My hands flew to my head, reality becoming bleary at the flood of  images.</p>
<p>The man struck out punching the young woman in the  face. She fell with little resistance as gravity pulled her  downwards. The dead weight of her body hit the cement floor.  Screaming, so much screaming…His voice pierced my memory saying  that little phrase ‘I love you’.</p>
<p>I forced myself to look  down by the lake, pulling myself up to reconstruct my mental  barriers. Deep breathes…As I was doing so the male down by the lake  finally noticed my watchful presence. Immediately had he done so I  shot him a look of such hatred and disgust. The extreme paling of his  face and the intense emotion of fear for the split second revealed to  me everything of his worth- spineless coward.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p>“I-I got to go now.” The man stuttered.</p>
<p>He  turned to go suddenly and almost sprinted away. I wonder what that  was about? With that out of the way I returned to working on my  project. I studied the piece with a critical eye. It was good, had  the technique without a doubt but it was missing something. I  pondered on that thought. You have to paint what you feel… How it  seemed so similar to what I’ve told Kaiya. But what was I trying to  convey in this when I first started?</p>
<p>For moment I attempted  to put the brush down on the partially dried watercolors but stopped  short. This wasn’t going to get me anywhere, for all I know I may  ruin what I have created already. I sighed in slight frustration,  careful to put down the artist instrument onto a small stand. The  lake was beautiful today, the weather…perfect. That’s why I  dragged Haruka out here, I had hoped this place would inspire me  again. Being at home listening to music wasn’t the same thing.</p>
<p>I  dragged my thoughts along every small object as my gaze swept through  the area. Desperately wishing for something, but for what I could not  say. Taking a mental break I thought of the recent conversation. That  man…There was nothing attractive about him, the way he carried  himself. His speech was dead and false. The clarity of his eyes were  bordered shut, no spark whatsoever. However flattered I should’ve  felt for being asked out to this ‘Affection Contest’ the feeling  of disgust never eluded me; not for the contest but for the lust that  was the apparent motive behind his actions.</p>
<p>“Michiru…?”  Came a shaky voice.</p>
<p>Immediately I had turned around to be  greeted by a familiar face.</p>
<p>“Haruka!” Why was she so  pale? “What’s wrong? Are you all right?” I made to reach out to  her face but she jerked back suddenly. For some reason her rejection  of my comfort hurt me deeply, what was bothering her this much? Could  it be from the previous slap? But I had thought we’ve gotten over  that. The one person I could always count on to be there for me…</p>
<p>“No  Michi…” Haruka whispered as I stood up.</p>
<p>There was  something very wrong, the way her eyes darted in an unfocused way.  No, this was something more... She wouldn’t let me touch her face,  so…</p>
<p>I walked up to the shaking girl, watchful as she tried  to back away slightly. My arms wrapped around her tall, sleek frame  careful not to startle her too much. Almost immediately there was an  unexpected resistance to the comfort. Haruka tried to break the  contact but it only motivated me to hold her tighter.</p>
<p>“Haruka,  please…calm down.” Deep rasping breaths exited the blonde as she  tried her best to comply with my wishes. “It’s all right, I’m  here…” I whispered comforting words to her.</p>
<p>Her body  suddenly slumped against mine, both of ours knees hitting the grass  under us simultaneously. The weight of her on me required myself to  bring out a strength I rarely used except for battle.</p>
<p>“M-Michi…”  Haruka muttered. She closed her eyes and rested her head upon my  shoulder. There was a trance-like quality to the strange voice.</p>
<p>I  stroked her short blonde locks, massaging any tension that remained.  Soft breathing noises in my ear made me wonder if she had fallen  asleep.</p>
<p>“Haruka?” I asked.</p>
<p>There was no response  but I was not disturbed. The rise and fall of her chest told me  everything was fine now. I turned us over on the grass, allowing the  taller girl’s head to rest in my lap. This treatment was almost a  ritual between the two of us, just for us. So many times had I’ve  succumbed to the nightmares as well…Dark nights where it all came  rushing back. The past and the future colliding with me trapped in  the middle, no escape.</p>
<p>For a moment I closed my eyes and  listened to the sound of fluttering wings of the birds. Yes…I  remember nights where I woke up shivering in bed, wanting to call out  for people who were longer here. ‘Mama’…’Papa’…Lifeless  meanings, nothing more than that.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes again to  look down at the peaceful figure. Her warmth seeped through the  uniform I mused. Such an adorable face, angelic-like as she rested.  There was never a time Haruka stopped caring for me, even now, if I  needed her and it meant sacrificing her ‘beauty sleep’ she’d  come running. A small smile played across my lips at the humor. I  always felt safe as she rocked me to sleep, her hushing voice and  reassuring words like a lullaby to my ears. How much longer could we  go on, how much longer could we go on together? Life could be a cruel  messenger…the two of us have witnessed enough to realize this.  Could I abandon you if the choice came to me? But I already knew the  answer.</p>
<p>“Mm…Michiru?” The sleeping girl started to come  to.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon sleepy head.” I giggled. At that  moment I had almost said ‘had a good dream’ but stopped short and  settled for a “How do you feel?”</p>
<p>“Ugh…like shit.”  Even though Haruka was feeling like ‘shit’ she attempted to  smile. A weak one but it was genuine. The air immediately brightened  around. It was almost a miniature paradise, this moment, with the two  of us together.</p>
<p>“Was it…?” Was it another  premonition?</p>
<p>Haruka shook her head.</p>
<p>“No…I don’t  think so.” The blonde was staring at the back of her right hand.  “Honestly, I can’t really remember any of it  except…”</p>
<p>“Except?”</p>
<p>“…Nah, it’s  nothing.”</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish you wouldn’t hold your  feelings back. Lightly my hand brushed some of her bangs from her  eyes. I’d listen to anything you’d want to  say…</p>
<p>“Hey…Haruka?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“…Would  you like to participate in this ‘Affection Contest’ with me?” I  was well aware of the blush spreading across my cheeks at the  mention.</p>
<p>“What?” She suddenly sat up.</p>
<p>“W-well…you  just seem to bored and all…wouldn’t it make a good prank? I…I  mean it might make you feel better, laughter is the best cure right?  That is unless you don’t want to…I-oh, never mind it was  a-“</p>
<p>“YES!”</p>
<p>Her shout startled me slightly. Did  she actually just agree? Haruka coughed and cleared her throat  continuing in a more steady tone,</p>
<p>“I mean, of course. Why  not?” This time we both smiled.</p>
<p>“Then we should go sign  up, I heard there’s only a limited number of entries allowed.” I  pointed out.</p>
<p>“Great, then let’s get going. Isn’t it  today?”</p>
<p>“I believe so.”</p>
<p>“No time to waste  then!” Haruka stood up and offered her hand to me. In seconds I was  up on my feet as well. Gathering up the art supplies we then left for  the registration booth.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p>“I…give…UP!” Yuuchiro collapsed onto the  stone steps of the shrine.</p>
<p>“Already?”</p>
<p>We had just  got back from our escapade around the city.</p>
<p>“Y-yes…” He  huffed and puffed. Man, did he ever look worn out, perhaps not enough  exercise?</p>
<p>“Great, that means I can go get some shut eye.”  I yawned. All these silly challenges were tiresome.</p>
<p>“No way,  that was a draw!” Yuuchiro exclaimed. “In hide and go seek tag,  finding the person is half the game. I just…didn’t catch you  that’s all.” He pouted.</p>
<p>“Fine, whatever…”</p>
<p>“See?  I told you so.” There was a grin across his goofy face.</p>
<p>“Pray  tell just how did we go from chores to a game of hide and go seek  tag?”</p>
<p>“Well…actually how did it happen? I can’t  remember.”</p>
<p>“You…mean…you played TAG”</p>
<p>“GAH!” Both Yuuchiro and I gasped, recognizing that  menacing tone.</p>
<p>“Rei! I’m sorry! It’ll never happen  again…it, uhh, it was her fault.” He shoved a finger towards my  direction.</p>
<p>Lucky for me there was a disbelieving look on  Rei’s face.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m so sure! You’re always like  this Yuuchiro, no wonder we should replace you.”</p>
<p>“W-wait…what?”  The man questioned, hoping he heard what he did. “Then that means  you aren’t…”</p>
<p>“Bingo, it was just a joke.” I chipped  in. The weight of feeling guilty lifted from my  shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’m…not…”He slowly mumbled.</p>
<p>“Yes  already!” Rei shouted at the whimpering male. “You aren’t being  replaced it was just a joke! Now get going on those chores!”</p>
<p>“Hai!  Thanks you so much Rei!” Gosh, there were tears in his eyes…Is he  really that happy to get to work?</p>
<p>“Yeah, whatever…” The  miko turned to go. “Oh, Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Some  people are coming over later and I want to introduce you to the gang.  Would you mind cleaning up the guest room while I get  changed?”</p>
<p>“Sure, no problem.” Darn, there goes my sleep.  Ah well, it can’t be helped I suppose.</p>
<p>I left Yuuchiro to  go chop the firewood and Rei to the guestroom while I proceeded to  tidy up. Nothing much was required to be cleaned. Table, a pile of  pillows…Some of the furniture needed to be moved around and some  dirt was brushed up. But for the most part it seemed like Rei kept  this place fairly kept by herself.</p>
<p>It was almost immediately  after I had just finished when the sliding door entrance  opened.</p>
<p>“Kaiya, you done yet?” Rei peeked around the  door.</p>
<p>“Yeah, just finished.” I waved to her.</p>
<p>“Great  you’re the best.” She turned her attention back behind the door  where I could hear faint sounds of giggles. “Come on in guys.”</p>
<p>A  group of girls waltzed in cautiously. The one closest to my height  was a chestnut haired girl. Besides the fact she was the tallest of  the girls, her rose earrings also made her stand out. The tall girl  looked much tougher than her friend- a blue haired girl stood meekly  by her side since they’ve entered the room. Her blue eyes  occasionally would glance nervously up into her taller friend’s  emerald. Perhaps she’s shy? On the other hand I recognized two blue  eyed blondes that chattered endlessly beside Rei. I think they had a  crush on Haruka or something like that last I remember.</p>
<p>I  waited until everyone else had seated before I took a spot. It felt  odd to be sitting around a bunch of people who were all close  friends, it’s like feeling you don’t belong. Even more so, there  was this strange feeling I was getting from the group of girls…can’t  place it exactly but…</p>
<p>“Kaiya, so this Usagi and Minako.  You’ve met them before at the arcade remember?”</p>
<p>“That’s  right.”</p>
<p>“You mean you remember us? Oh my God!” The  blondes shrieked. You know, they’ve could’ve passed as twins, I  swear.</p>
<p>“So how’s Haruka?” Minako interrogated at once.  “Is she okay? Don’t you think she’s so cool? Do you guys talk  often?”</p>
<p>For a moment I could never have thought it would  get any worse with the questions until her blonde counterpart joined  in.</p>
<p>“I want to hear about Michiru!” Usagi whined. “Did  you know she played the violin?”</p>
<p>“Yeah actually-“</p>
<p>“Isn’t  Michiru so graceful? I want to be just like her when I grow up!”  Usagi continued, ignoring my previous answer. Maybe they just want to  talk…? “She’s so pretty don’t you think? I’d loved to be  regular friends with her. You’re so lucky! What sort of stuff is  she into? Do you think Haruka and Michiru are really close? Who do  you like better?” She talked so fast that I barely caught any of  that!</p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, just who do you think is  the best of the two?” Minako ganged up with Usagi.</p>
<p>“Well  I…”</p>
<p>“Haruka right?” Minako tried to persuade me.</p>
<p>“No  way! It’s Michiru.” Usagi argued.</p>
<p>“WELL?” They both  suddenly jumped the question onto me.</p>
<p>“Er…” Kami, help!</p>
<p>“Come on you guys, can’t you see you’re overloading  Kaiya with your questions?” The blue haired girl finally spoke up.  Wow, so she talks!</p>
<p>“Yeah, I mean think for once before you  speak.” The chestnut haired girl joined in.</p>
<p>“It’s all  right.” Really I only needed to take a few seconds to breathe. “I  can’t really answer that question.” I directed the answer to the  blondes. “Both Michiru and Haruka are unique in their own way, how  can you ask me to judge my ‘friends’ asking which is better? You  can’t compare them…In a way, it would be asking you…” I waved  a hand towards Usagi, “To choose who you like the best out of the  group here.”</p>
<p>Usagi seemed to gulp, obviously not wanting to  think of undergoing such a task.</p>
<p>“Y-yeah…I guess that’s  true.” Minako spoke up, she seemed to scratch her cheek in an  embarrassed way.</p>
<p>“A perfectly logical answer.” The blue  haired girl replied again. That’s twice now! Isn’t she on a  roll?</p>
<p>“You are?” I outstretched my hand.</p>
<p>“Oh…Forgive  me. I’m Ami, Mizuno Ami.” She introduced herself as we shook  hands.</p>
<p>“Ah…Maybe I should ask to be forgiven, but you  don’t seem to be the talkative type.”</p>
<p>Ami blushed,  looking down at her note book which had suddenly became very  interesting.</p>
<p>“I told you Ami!” Her tall friend laughed.  “Even a stranger can tell. You should talk more!”</p>
<p>“Makoto…”  Ami replied back.</p>
<p>“Right, right, I know. Kino Makoto.” The  girl offered her hand. “I like to cook and practice martial  arts.”</p>
<p>That was…an interesting hobby combination. However  the martial arts comment caught my interest more than the  other.</p>
<p>“You do martial arts? How good are you?”</p>
<p>“All  right I suppose.”</p>
<p>“That’s a laugh. Don’t let her fool  you Kaiya, Makoto can cream anyone.” Minako informed me.</p>
<p>“Well…”  Makoto blushed from the compliment. Determined to evade the spotlight  the brunette asked “What about you Kaiya?”</p>
<p>Hmm…I  suppose I should be careful with this. “Well… I know <em>some</em> martial arts.”</p>
<p>“What! Really?” Everyone seemed to  shout.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Was it really a big deal?</p>
<p>“Hey  that’s great! We could go training together then sometime, what do  you say?” Makoto seemed excited about the idea.</p>
<p>“Sure,  sounds good to me.”</p>
<p>“Awww man. No fair, all the cool  people know karate.” Usagi groaned. “I wanna learn  too.”</p>
<p>“Martial arts.” Makoto corrected the shorter  blonde.</p>
<p>“See? You don’t even know how to address it!”  Rei scolded poor Usagi. “Sometimes you can be so  useless.”</p>
<p>“ReeeeEEEi, why are you always mean to me?”  Here come the waterworks.</p>
<p>“Maybe if you weren’t such a  irresponsible crybaby!”</p>
<p>“I’m not a crybaby!”</p>
<p>“Are  too!”</p>
<p>“Are not!”</p>
<p>“Are too!”</p>
<p>“Are  not!”</p>
<p>“BLEEEEH!”</p>
<p>“BLAAAAH!”</p>
<p>The  both of them were in each other’s faces now.</p>
<p>“Knock  it off you guys.” Makoto tried to interfere.</p>
<p>“Let them be  Makoto, you know they’re always like this. It helps them blow off  some steam.” Minako casually noted.</p>
<p>“You just want to  watch them fight.” Ami had hit the mark dead on.</p>
<p>“Moi?”  The blonde faked with false innocence.</p>
<p>The answer was  obvious by the way Ami and Makoto shot her an accusing  look.</p>
<p>“Er…yeah you got me.” The girl pouted.</p>
<p>“Would  anyone like anything to drink?” I inquired. “I was going by the  kitchen, would anyone like something?”</p>
<p>The mention of food  drew Usagi out of her argument with the miko.</p>
<p>“FOOD?”  There was a look of insanity in her sparkling blue orbs, just a guess  but the way she drooled over the table <em>probably</em> meant she was  hungry. I nodded my head, trying my best not to roll back in  laughter. “Great! I want…”</p>
<p>Five minutes later I left  the small room with a huge list. Wow…was she really going to eat  this much? Reaching the kitchen I proceeded to fill a tray with cakes  and pastries, wondering how I was going to carry it all back. Then  there was the tea…I wouldn’t want to spill that on me. I know,  maybe I’ll get Yuuchiro to help me. Besides the guy can’t refuse  anything if it’s for Rei.</p>
<p>“Yuuchiro!” I called at the  kitchen entrance. He couldn’t be too far away, I mean, he was doing  choirs wasn’t he? When there was no answer I called again,  “YUUCHIROOOOO!”</p>
<p>Where has that baka gone? The water was  just starting to boil. Seeing I had some time to I decided to go down  to the firewood stack to see if I could find the lazy guy. Going  around the back of the shrine I listened anxiously for any signs of  wood being chopped but there was none. Did he wander off  somewhere?</p>
<p>“Hmm…” I thought, only it wasn’t me who  said it out loud.</p>
<p>“Yuuchiro?” I ducked my head around the  corner too see the man slumped against the exterior shrine  wall.</p>
<p>“Ah!” He jumped. “I-it’s only you…Thank Kami,  for a moment I thought it was Rei.”</p>
<p>“Did you finish  chopping the wood already?”</p>
<p>“Well no…But…”</p>
<p>“But…?  Hey, wait a second. What do you have there?”</p>
<p>Yuuchiro  backed away immediately and tried to hide a piece of paper behind his  back.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me it’s that Affection Contest.” I  bluntly guessed.</p>
<p>“How’d you know? A-Am… I that  obvious?”</p>
<p>I found myself rolling my eyes. “Of course. And  you want to ask Rei to enter with you right?”</p>
<p>“…” The  poor man was too red in the face to respond.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t  bother.” I muttered, pivoting on the spot, ready to leave.</p>
<p>“What?  Why not! Am I not good enough for her or something?”</p>
<p>“That’s  something you have to ask her baka.” Silence.</p>
<p>“I  know…but, you wouldn’t understand what it means to be truly in  love with someone. To feel that one person means more than the world  to you.” There was sorrow in his voice, leaving the words hanging  heavy in the air. Was I angry? I don’t know…</p>
<p>But I did  know that I felt pity for him. Humans can easily be made or broken by  the emotions they cling to. It’s just a truth of reality whether we  like it or not. Everything comes down to our choices, choosing to  accept our feelings as our own or live in a life of denial. I…am no  exception. “I’m just saying Yuuchiro, this might be rushing it.  It would much easier if she was already going out with you but asking  her to do something like this out of the blue? If Rei rejects you it  could push you two farther apart than you are now.” I turned to  face the man.</p>
<p>“I…But I…”</p>
<p>“Take it slowly. If  you really meant that she is the only one for you, you can wait. Keep  trying to win her affections one step at a time… little endeavors  will go a long ways, more than you think. Then… in the end,  perhaps she’ll return your feelings.</p>
<p>Turning to leave I  was stopped again.</p>
<p>“What is it now?” I started to feel  irritated, but my voiced died down instantly when his whisper  replied,</p>
<p>“Hey Kaiya, do you have someone…” There was a  searching tone in his voice, but it was more hopeful than the  desperate voice I had heard earlier.</p>
<p>“Ile…”</p>
<p>“But!  How can you know so much about love if you haven’t…”</p>
<p>“Lucky  I guess.” I cut him short. It was something I really didn’t want  to talk about.</p>
<p>A small breeze hit the area, sending the  leaves dancing.</p>
<p>“Oh, Yuuchiro…Could you help me carry the  tea and sweets to Rei and her friend’s? Usagi ordered a huge pile  and I can’t carry it all by myself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! No  problem!”</p>
<p><u>After gathering the goods</u></p>
<p>We  finally made it back to the room with the trays. Usagi and Rei were  at it again while everyone else watched patiently.</p>
<p>“Fooooooood!”  Usagi clamored towards us at an abnormal pace. I had the sudden urge  to drop the tray but resisted, allowing the starved blonde to nearly  knock me over.</p>
<p>“Usagi watch it! I don’t want tea on the  floor!” Rei scolded the girl.</p>
<p>“But I’m sooooo hungry!”  Then she stuffed three pork buns into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Argh!  You’re such a pig!” The miko scowled.</p>
<p>“You know, if we  want to go watch the contest we’d better get going.” Amy pointed  out. “I don’t think we should be late as we are going to cheer  Umino and Naru  on.”</p>
<p>“That’s right!” Minako gasped, suddenly  remembering and awakening from her drowsy trance. “Usagi you better  drop everything cause we’re going, NOW!” The blonde dashed  forward and took her ‘twin’ by the arm.</p>
<p>“Mmf Fwof!”  (Translation: my food!)</p>
<p>“You guys going to come too?”  Makoto asked Yuuchiro and me.</p>
<p>“I might tag along later.”  I replied.</p>
<p>“Umm…is Rei going?” Yuuchiro asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,  of course.”</p>
<p>“…I…I think I’ll pass.”</p>
<p>“Your  loss then, see you guys later!”</p>
<p>Amy and Makoto left to  follow the blonde tornado.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you going?” It  seemed odd that he would pass up an opportunity.</p>
<p>“Because…Seeing  all the couples I’ll feel envious. Maybe I’ll do something I’ll  regret. I don’t want to rush things, I can wait.” He  smiled.</p>
<p>“Makoto, Amy?” Rei dashed into the room.</p>
<p>“You  just missed them Rei.” I told the confused girl. “They already  left.”</p>
<p>“What! Oh no…I better hurry.” She scrambled  around the room, picking up little trinkets here and there before  chucking them into a purse. I gave Yuuchiro one of the pastries while  Rei’s back was turned. Although I received a questioning look, one  glance towards the raven-haired girl was enough explanation. It was  cute the way he blushed; maybe he has a chance after all. I turned  left and hanged around the hallways just outside, peeking through a  hole in the screen of the wall to the room inside.</p>
<p>“Umm…Rei?”  Yuuchiro’s voice was a bit shaky.</p>
<p>“What is it? Can’t you  see I’m busy?” The sound of pillows being chucked around the room  could be heard.</p>
<p>“I-I thought…”</p>
<p>“Listen! I-“  She froze upon seeing the little treat in Yuuchiro’s hand.</p>
<p>“You  know, on the go…Can’t have you starving.” He  smiled.</p>
<p>“I…umm…thank you.” I could’ve sworn both of  them were red in the face now. I leaned back and proceeded down to  the back of the shrine thinking about what I’ve said to Yuuchiro  earlier.</p>
<p>The answers…have no emotion. Logical solutions to  the problem…What a complicated but simple subject, love.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, contest grounds</u></p>
<p><u></u>LOVE IS GREAT! Okay I didn’t  shout that out loud but its got to be the best feeling in the world.  I know it’s love, it can’t be anything else! This is it I’m  actually going on a date with Michiru! ‘<em>Fake mini date’</em> a  voice in my head corrected me. All right I admit, even if it’s not  real I still get to be close to her and nothing can ruin  that!</p>
<p>Momentarily I checked over my own attire to make sure  it was perfect. Dark blue shirt tucked in? Check. Snazzy light blue  jacket, check. Belt and matching white pants? Double check! Looking  good so far I mused, however, Michiru always managed to outdo me in  the fashion department. The aqua haired woman sported a long pink  dress, the fabric wasn’t quite as thin as a normal dress but  leaning towards a thick cotton. Loosely, a matching pink ribbon tied  securely around her waist waved in the wind’s grasp slightly. So  simple…yet perfect. I smiled.</p>
<p>“What  are you thinking about Ruka?” My partner asked, her hands around my  elbow tightened their grip as she moved into my side. She’s leaning  against me! Kami, if this is a dream please never wake me up.</p>
<p>“Well,  we have some time before the contest starts…Want to get something  to eat?” All right, not exactly the most intelligent thing to say  but it was the first thing that came to mind!</p>
<p>“Sure.” She  giggled.</p>
<p>We could always go on the rides next. I was really  glad that they updated this event, now it had rides, attractions,  food stands and just about everything else! Maybe I’ll play the  games later and win Michiru something, would she like that?</p>
<p>We  walked by all the various couples in the park, all apparently in love  as much as Michiru and I pretended to be. Amazing how jealous people  can get. You can tell how they never stopped staring. A thought  crossed my mind and I pondered it for a moment hesitant. Aww, what  the heck!</p>
<p>“Ruka? Ah!” Michiru let out a small giggle and  squeak of surprise when I wrapped an arm around her shoulders  suddenly, crushing her petite body against my own. “Troublemaker…”  She whispered with a smile and pinched my cheek.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p>I admit she had taken me by surprise when she  gave me a bear hug, but it was a pleasant sensation. It feels nice,  to lean on her like this sharing body heat even on a nice day like  this. But it’s pretend isn’t it? Will things go back as nothing  happened once it’s all over? I didn’t realize how sad the thought  made me just then, the sudden sadness caused my knees to  buckle.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p><strong>Thup.</strong></p>
<p>When I slowly  opened my eyes I realized that Haruka had caught me.</p>
<p>“Michi  are you all right?”</p>
<p>“Never better.” I lied through my  teeth. It hurt inside but I didn’t want to make her sad or have her  worry about me. Her comforting arms released me once I had regained  balance on my own two feet.</p>
<p>“Can we play a game?” Haruka  shouted suddenly, pointing to a game’s booth a few stalls up. “They  have a racing one! I know I can win.” There was a pleading tone in  her voice, like a little child asking her mom for some candy.</p>
<p>“Of  course, we are here to have fun right?”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go!”  Ruka grasped my arm and guided through the crowd with ease. I  couldn’t say it but the feeling was stronger than last time under  the tree in the park. Could it really be…?<br />
  <u><br />
  </u>“Ugh…”  I relapsed. It was different, a negative energy this time.</p>
<p>“Michi!”  Haruka called to me concerned.</p>
<p>Did you just…feel that?”   I muttered.</p>
<p>Both of our eyes wandered over to the stage  platform where the contest was to be held in the distance.</p>
<p>“That  must mean…” My partner started.</p>
<p>“That a pure heart  snatcher will appear…” I finished.</p>
<p>We can’t let a pure  heart fall into the hands of our enemy. Looks like our evening out  will be cut short.</p>
<p><u>The contest, Haruka’s  POV</u></p>
<p>Warily I stiffly stood by Michi’s side and I  had noticed that she was also tense. When she wants too the woman can  sure hide her feelings, I admired. My eyes drew away from the shorter  girl and to the crowd cheering from the front of the stage. No sign  yet, will the attack come during the contest? When! I demanded I  racked my mind for a logical answer. The host had started to shout  something, however I had barely heard a single word for the rotating  tie wrapped around his neck caught my attention. Easily amused? That  was me. It was the only interesting thing about him I must admit, I  mean, nothing exciting about the standard black slack, shirt and red  vest.</p>
<p>“Hi everybody and welcome. Is your life full of love?  I sure hope it is for your sake! With me on stage are ten young  people whose lives are full of love and they’re here today to  compete with one another about to reveal their true affection. The  winners will be two people who can prove the bonds of friendship and  the purity of their hearts. I now wish good luck to the  contestants!”</p>
<p>The crowd voiced their excitement with loud  cheers. For a moment I quickly realized who was right up front, Usagi  and her pals. Dimly I could hear Rei and Minako cheering Michiru and  I on, which was cute and all but…It would be so embarrassing to  admit feelings on stage in front of everybody! The facial muscles  started to tense as I forced myself to remain calm and composed.  Smile and no one will suspect a thing, just smile.</p>
<p>“Huh?”  I half gasped to myself. Had my eyes not deceived me, I could’ve  sworn I saw someone lurking behind that tree behind the crowd.</p>
<p>“What  is it?” Michiru asked, her eyes never leaving the crowd. I saw her  smile as Rei gave her a compliment on her hair.</p>
<p>“Just be on  guard.” Was all I could say. Michi nodded her head before she  disappeared behind back with the other girls.</p>
<p>“The first  round of our contest is a warm up. We want you guys to find your best  friend’s hand. There they are.” Hands started to peek through the  heart shaped holes in the multiple doors that I faced along with the  population of confused males. “Go on guys, you pick y our best  friend’s hand and take it.”</p>
<p>On instinct alone I found  myself standing in front of a door. A feeling had told me Michiru was  behind it and I trusted my gut choice. Without hesitation I grasped  the hand and right there, I knew I had made the right choice. Her  soft touch lingered in the soft skin. My eyes closed as I wished that  the pesky man would hurry along with business so I could see Michiru  again.</p>
<p>“Here’s a guy who’s pretty quick.” To my  annoyance he shoved the speaker into my face. “Okay, now could you  please tell us the friend’s name.”</p>
<p>“<em>What</em>?” I  stared down coldly at the man. Was he really serious?</p>
<p>“U-Uh…I…Well,  could you please tell us the name of your young friend here?”</p>
<p>“I  think that’s a pretty personal question, you know.”</p>
<p>“C’mon  please? We have to follow a script here.” Beads of sweat now  apparent on his brow. In that instant I felt a smidgen of pity for  the man, after all, he was just doing as required by his employer.  “Michiru.”</p>
<p>The door opened as Michiru stepped out. A  small smile was on those perfect lips and the best part was, it was  genuine. Her eyes sparkled upon meeting me. I met her halfway. The  crowd cheered as the announcer went to work with the other  contestants but it didn’t matter, nothing else seemed to matter in  this isolated moment of emotion.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV,  contest site</u></p>
<p>Backed away from the rest of the crowd,  I watched the contest at a safe distance. Rei and her friends were up  front I noticed but I had also noticed a certain ‘couple’ on  stage. Both were women amidst four other couples of heterosexuals.  Interesting…No one seemed to have noticed yet, perhaps luck really  is on Haruka’s side. But what she had said earlier continued to  prod my thoughts. Were same gender couples really abnormal? Back at  home it was perfectly normal, what was the big deal?</p>
<p>The  sound of a roaring crowd caught my attention again. The first around  was over and it appeared that Haruka and Michiru won the first round.  Amazing how quick Haruka picked Michiru’s hand…honestly I don’t  think I could ever do that. If it were me I might’ve ended up  like…</p>
<p>“This is Naru’s hand!” A short, nerdy looking  guy shouted as he clutched a hand.</p>
<p>“I’m  not Naru.” Came a female voice.</p>
<p>Poor guy I found myself  pitying as he pursued to beg for forgiveness from his girlfriend on  stage. <em>And</em> she wasn’t even demanding it either! Probably too  embarrassed to come out quite yet.</p>
<p><strong>Swish.</strong></p>
<p>The  sound of crushed grass caused my ears to perk up. Turning towards the  source I detected a dark shadowy figure camouflaging behind a tree by  the crowd. Her long hair shot in and out of the sunlight that had  filtered through the thick green foliage above the woman. Red hair,  something in my mind was already piecing the puzzle together. My eyes  squinted while the rest of me was careful not to make any sudden  movements as I desperately tried to calm my pounding heart. Was it  anxiety? Fear? No, it wasn’t that I concluded as a new feeling  surfaced. Instinctively I was wary and tense but not as a result from  the other two emotions I had just dismissed. Excitement and a need  for revenge, I was sure of it.</p>
<p>Smoothly the figure shifted  their weight from one foot to the other. The ambiance of arrogance  and confidence the woman held irked me. Thoughts of identification  were now at the tip of my mind. As it came closer a feeling of  predator and prey began to engulf me. There wasn’t something right  with this creature, human was definitely out of the question. I  wanted to pounce and attack, to rid myself of the condescending  presence.</p>
<p>My heart skipped a beat as the woman turned around  slowly, still unaware of my watchful eye. That face! Another cold  feeling flooded my psyche, cranking up the need to obliterate.</p>
<p>“You…” I growled <em>very </em>quietly.</p>
<p>It was  that woman back in the garden when I had been with Hisa! How could I  forget such a face? I cursed.</p>
<p>Suddenly the figure zipped in  flash, one moment there and the next…I spun my head to the opposite  direction of my position and glimpsed the flash of movement. She was  moving fast, <em>deadly</em> fast. Without telling my legs to do so I  was on the trail, attempting to keep a safe distance between us two.  If she was here…then that means…</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV,  after the second round</u></p>
<p>“Phew, that three legged  round was sure invigorating, right Michiru?” I made my way to  untie our legs.</p>
<p>“It was, wasn’t it?” She smiled. “Not  much of a challenge though.”</p>
<p>Right, compared to fighting  youma this was a walk in the park quite literally.</p>
<p>“Our  third round is karaoke duet.” The host informed us all.</p>
<p>It  was another easy win for both Michiru and I. We both knew what was  going to happen next, most likely the man will ask us to reveal our  true feelings to each other. However much I wanted to tell Michiru  what I felt this wasn’t the right way. Going public and admitting  your affection for another wasn’t the thing that bothered me; it  was the fact they treated it as some game. A ‘friendship’  contest, what a joke. I’m sure that if Kaiya were here she’d be  hanging her head in shame at my thoughts to back out. But…what does  she really know? Despite what I’ve seen so far of her interaction  among fellow classmates all her cheerfulness was rather phony. In my  eyes she comes across the type to isolate herself from others by her  own free will. Which is really surprising because it seems people are  naturally attracted to her. If she were to put an honest effort into  it and open herself up more, she really could have some decent  friends. What’s with that girl?</p>
<p>Has…she really known  love?</p>
<p>“I hope he and his girlfriend win the contest…”  Michiru whispered. I turned my gaze over to a clumsy looking couple  standing next to us. The short guy had been trying much too hard to  please his girl and failed at every attempt to do so. Honest and  trying so hard. A feeling of guilt hit me directly in the stomach.  Originally Michiru and I had entered the contest for a joke, secretly  I wanted to win and profess secret feelings Michiru may never forgive  me for. However, now that we may win…“And now ladies and  gentlemen, it’s time for the final round of our contest. The ones  who lost up to now get one last chance. We call this round, the depth  of affection. And this time ladies and gentlemen of the public,  you’ll be the judges. Your applause will rate the success of the  contestants, are you ready?”</p>
<p>It just didn’t feel right.  The crowd cheered in appreciated for the umpteenth time of the day.  Michiru sent me a nervous glance but I made no motion to acknowledge  it.</p>
<p>“So  now we’ll start with this charming couple. Could you please tell  the audience how you feel about her?”</p>
<p>I took a deep  breath.</p>
<p>“This show is over.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” The man  nervously questioned, still intimidated by my cold behavior from  earlier events.</p>
<p>“I said we’re dropping out of the contest,  it was all a joke.”</p>
<p>“But wait, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>I  paused shortly, enough time to give Michiru a reassuring smile. She  only smiled back with complete understanding. It wasn’t the time to  tell her, not yet. A new resolution solidified inside. I don’t need  some stupid contest to come out and tell the person I love about my  feelings; I know what I feel for her is <em>real</em>, that’s what  really matters. When I’m ready, I’ll reveal my vulnerabilities  and whether you’ll accept or reject them is up to you. I thought of  the sea goddess. So until then…please wait for me a little longer  Michi.</p>
<p>“We entered this silly true affection contest as a  practical joke. We never meant to make fun of real couples in  love…but now it looks like we might win it, we’re stepping out in  favor of love.” I raised my arms up towards the crowd. “Real love  should win! Cause real love dwells in pure hearts!” I could feel  my eyes shining with emotion. The crowd seemed to be deeply affected  as well. Satisfied I finally said, “C’mon, let’s go.” To my  partner.</p>
<p>“Goodbye and good luck.” Michiru gracefully  stepped down.</p>
<p>We both left the stage as the confessions  continued on. However my mind was no longer on the subject of love,  it was hammering the idea of expected battle. If would be soon, it  had to be as the contest was almost over.</p>
<p>Sooner than  expected, right on cue screams erupted from the area we had  previously left. Lucky for the remoteness of the location we could  transform right here without a problem. Positively sure there were no  witnesses I asked,</p>
<p>“Ready Michi?”</p>
<p>“Ready when you  are.” She nodded.</p>
<p>Lifting our henshin pens we called out  the transformation phrases,</p>
<p>“Uranus planet power, make  up!”</p>
<p>“Neptune planet power, make up!”</p>
<p>Bright  light engulfed our bodies, a gold in my presence and aquamarine with  Michi. As it faded to reveal our counterpart identities of Sailor  Uranus and Sailor Neptune we made a mad dash towards the site, ready  to face any challenge dead on, together.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p>“Ah shimatta! I lost her.”: I grumbled.</p>
<p>What had happened exactly? Where I was now was irritatingly  close to where the chase had originally started. Had I been running  in circles?</p>
<p>“Ahhh!<strong>”</strong> Girlish screams pierced through  the air.</p>
<p>My head whipped around towards the contest site.  What the hell is going on down there? I panicked, thinking about  Michiru and Haruka. Were they all right? Not wanting to waste another  moment I rushed down towards the rapidly dispersing crowd.</p>
<p>“I  am Sailor Jupiter!”</p>
<p>Before I knew it I had jumped up into a  group of trees back away a safe distance from a sight that would send  me into a state of immediate shock. My mind attempted in vain to  rebuke the image. It was another youma! With…a heart thing stuck in  the center of its chest.</p>
<p>“Do it.” There was a familiar  sinister voice. Looking up through my long blonde bangs I could  barely see a figure floating up past my position. So close…I  glared. All thoughts of Haruka and Michiru faded as I reached back  into my pocket for the bracelets when the voices continued with their  speech.</p>
<p>“And in the name of the moon, we shall punish  you!”</p>
<p>Over half the distance away from where I was situated  was a group of…</p>
<p>“Sailor scouts?” I half admired upon  recognizing their battle fukus’. After watching countless battles  their images were imprinted clearly in my mind still. Mercury, Mars,  Jupiter, Venus and…Sailor Moon. The inner senshi had shown  themselves.</p>
<p>They were all there, the five of them. But where  were Uranus and Neptune? They were sailor scouts as well, shouldn’t  they be helping?</p>
<p>“Who are you!” On of the scouts called  out to the woman in red. I couldn’t help but think how young the  group of heroines looked. Just how old are they?</p>
<p>“Never mind  who I am, young girls like you should have more fun.” The woman  retorted in a superior attitude.</p>
<p>She snapped her fingers and  my back muscles tensed up, becoming rigid sensing the impending  danger. To my surprise the youma stabbed its hand into the heart  solid on its chest. The object began to shine an eerie yellowish  glow, as before my eyes, five adult looking men appeared out of  nowhere on the battlefield. My ears pricked up as well, where was  this strange music coming from? It had a hypnotizing tune to it I  suddenly realized and covered my ears.</p>
<p>Patiently I waited,  watching to see what the inner senshi would do. Part of me was very  excited but frozen in place from indecisive uncertainty; watching a  real battle, not something recorded in a book! Just imagine…</p>
<p>“What  are they…?”</p>
<p>Astonishment nailed me square in the face as  the scouts started to dance with their ‘human’ partners. No! I  wanted to scream. It’s not real! Before I could react the illusions  created by the monster reverted to their true forms, tier four or the  lowest of the low youma rank. With no definite mass, their malleable  clay-like tentacles wrapped around each sailor and proceeded to shock  the trapped girls with electrical impulses.</p>
<p>“<strong>Ahhhhh!”</strong> They all screamed in extreme pain.</p>
<p>Shimatta! Shimatta!  Shimatte! What should I do? Frantically I scanned the area, hoping  that someone would show up to save them. <em>‘I already told myself  I wouldn’t get involved!’</em> A voice in my head argued in  stubborn defiance. <em>‘But what if they die?’</em> Another pleaded  with my conscience. Already I was leaning towards the latter response  and so the same voice encouraged further. <em>‘They’re still  human, they can die you know.’</em> Everything started to swirl  internally, feeling my emotions collide as particles with elastic  collisions; rebounding off of each other continuously.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p>A bright stream of golden  light flew out of nowhere. Energy in the shape of a planet burst  forward and released the trapped scouts from their imprisonment. To  my relief I had evaded the pressuring decision; Uranus and Neptune  were here.</p>
<p>“I fight for love and justice, I’m Sailor  Uranus!”</p>
<p>“I also fight for love and justice, I’m Sailor  Neptune!”</p>
<p>“Took you long enough.” I grumbled to myself.</p>
<p>“Sorry girls, but now’s not the time for a crush.”  Neptune quickly chided the younger sailor teenagers.</p>
<p>The  figure in red now was positioned clearly in my view. I was mildly  aware that my fingers were inching towards the cuffs in my pocket. <em>‘I  thought you weren’t going to interfere.’</em> The voice was back.  I repressed the nagging tone and eyed my target very meticulously.  Wait for it…</p>
<p>“Your wasting your time,” The woman mocked  the group of senshi, “fighting us like this—“</p>
<p>“World…”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p>That witch won’t stop talking!</p>
<p>“Your  wasting your time,” I was itching to shut her up, “fighting us  like—“</p>
<p>“World…” I heard a voice call out. But…it  wasn’t Haruka’s. I turned immediately to confirm this with my own  eyes and it was true, Uranus was still motionless as I was.  “SHAKING!”</p>
<p>A burst of light destroyed the first set of  branches of a nearby group of trees to the side of the battlefield,  racing off towards the woman. She screamed as the planet energy  nicked her right side, sending drops of blood raining down onto the  ground directly below.</p>
<p>“You!” She hissed at our group,  believing one of us had done the deed.</p>
<p>My eyes darted back  towards the source of the fading light and noticed a shadowed figured  jumping down and away upon contact with the ground.</p>
<p>“Uranus!”  I pointed towards the area. Understanding the situation my partner  replied, “I’m going after whoever it is. Take care of the fort  here.”</p>
<p>“Finish them!” The floating injured being  commanded to the youma.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, during the  chase</u></p>
<p><u></u>Question bombarded my already stressed mind as  I ran after the figure. I could not see them clearly, only follow the  trail they left behind. Running through the various very recent  upturned twigs and dirt I knew I was right on their tail. So close  that I could hear their retreating footsteps hustle with heavy  urgency.</p>
<p>Who are you? How can you use my powers? Is it really  my power you are using? Are you good or evil?</p>
<p>“Stop!” I  shouted ahead. The being did not stop but only increased their speed.  Was I gaining? I too, tried to quicken my pace only to see too late a  tree branch head level recoiling back into my face.</p>
<p><strong>Whap!</strong></p>
<p>I  staggered back and cursed as bits of blood dripped from a corner of  my mouth. The footsteps faded ahead and I knew then that I had lost  them. Damn! My mind started to listen to my body’s complaints of a  hard day’s worth of living; already I was so tired. I better get  back to Michi.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, back at the  shrine</u></p>
<p>After I cleaned up and showered I retreated to  the security of my room. I was tired, no doubt about it but I needed  to finish the diary entry from earlier. If I didn’t get it done  now, I knew that I wouldn’t ever. The pen started to scribble onto  the paper,</p>
<p><em>Sorry about stopping the entry earlier but  something came up…Okay, well a few things. I ended up meeting a guy  named Yuuchiro who works here at the shrine. Rei didn’t tell him  that it was a joke when she said he was being replaced so I ended up  being stuck with a bunch of dumb chore challenges. However, he  basically lost everyone. I think somewhere along the way we just got  plain bored and started a game of hide and go seek tag.</em></p>
<p><em>While  hiding I ran to the nearby park in the area and up a tree.  Interestingly enough, my pant legging had caught in a crook of a  branch. You wouldn’t guess who found me, yup, Haruka. I know, very  embarrassing! For a while the bum stood there laughing in my face.  Sure it was funny for her, that was, until it was my turn to  laugh.</em></p>
<p><em>Bet you’re wondering what I’m talking about huh?  Well, Haruka actually does like Michiru…a lot. So I got her to ask  Michiru to this affection contest today. Supposedly you’re supposed  to prove your ‘friendship’. Haruka was right, it really was a  ‘love’ contest. All the ten people they were couples! Not just  best friends. Well okay, so Michiru and Haruka was not an official  couple, but they were still pretending to be. Sometimes I wonder if  Michiru likes Haruka in that way too, would be very interesting if  that were the case.</em></p>
<p><em>Back to the serious part, another youma  showed up today. It was really shocking, the second time I saw one in  two days. Is the past really so infested with such creatures? Anyway,  I indirectly met the inner senshi of the past here and they all look  so young! They sure act like children too, honestly, in the middle of  battle they decided to take leave of their senses and fall right into  an enemy trap. I’ve never seen such a blunder in any of the video  battle records at the palace, what gives?</em></p>
<p><em>I need some sleep,  so I’ll talk to you later.</em></p>
<p><em>Kaiya.</em></p>
<p>I think I’ll  keep it a secret, even from my diary a bit longer that I did  interfere in today’s battle. Absent-mindedly I stuff the small book  back into my drawer and reached over for Hotaru’s pouch. A sudden  realization had dawn on me as I proceeded to dump the entire sack out  in front of me.</p>
<p>Trinkets of sentimental value to my sister  littered the floor in front of my lap. Bills of this time’s  currency also rolled out in wades; very useful for later purposes I  noted. Quite basic to the eyes of many but it was like a treasure  sack to me. I shook the tough material of the bag and finally, a  photograph fell out last of all. The picture was very faded,  especially along the top half of the photo. Perhaps coming to the  past caused it to age? Immediately I recognized the problem. Then why  haven’t I changed? Wait…I felt my eyebrows furrow in thought.  What… if my form never shifted because I’ve never existed here?  That would’ve made sense but wouldn’t that mean other objects  such as the photo would get younger or look fresher since I <em>did</em> go <em>back</em> through time?</p>
<p>Time…I flopped backwards,  letting my back hit the hard floor. Going from future to past for  sure I thought things would become newer or something! The photograph  dangled loosely in my limp arm. I found myself seeing past the object  to the pile of trinkets. It was then that I saw something that  startled me. I pushed myself up, then crawled over to the collection  of items and picked up a small toy and a key chain. Both had at least  a bit of metal to them however, their condition differentiated as  exact opposites! The piece on the toy was completely rusted but the  key chain looked brand new. But both came in the pouch, from the same  future! I found myself crossing my legs, intensely staring at the  items. The wheels in my head were definitely spinning now.</p>
<p>What  if…what if there was a countering force to the ‘fountain of  youth’ effect? The de-aging process was definitely there; the key  chain was enough evidence. Forces act in pairs…so for every action  there must be an equal but opposite reaction. It reminded me of  something like Lenz’s Law; how there is an opposing force to stop  the initial force created. That had to be it, although some things do  revert to their younger or newer versions travelling back in time,  inevitably there will be objects that experience the opposite. So  then as for myself, the force that would’ve made me younger had no  effect because I’ve never existed here. Then the aging force…Well,  I knew that sailor senshi do not age. I’ve always been curious if  that would apply to me as well, since I am the daughter of two  senshi. Turns out that this ‘experiment’ answered that question  just nicely.</p>
<p>“Phew!”  I breathed, letting out some trapped air. That whole thing was a  doozy but I’m glad that it’s sorted out now. I pulled an arm up  onto my forehead, brushing a few of my bangs away from my eyes. The  other stretched directly in front of me to the photograph again. I  hadn’t really taken a good look at it I mused.</p>
<p>The picture  flipped in my hands as I bent down to get a better look. From what I  could make out, it was a couple, one woman was holding a baby  swaddled in cloths. However, their faces could not be made out from  the faded spaces.</p>
<p>I sat there for awhile, staring at the  picture. A feeling of nostalgia renewed in part of me. I’d seen  this picture before. I knew I had. Automatically my weary body laid  itself down onto the futon as I placed the photograph beside the  mattress at my eye level. The lights outside flickered before finally  turning off; Rei must’ve blown out the lantern. I was officially  exhausted, both physically and mentally. Soon sleep follow.</p>
<p><em>I  fight for love and justice…</em></p>
<p>“Do…you really?” I  questioned, still hearing the sailor’s introduction speeches.</p>
<p>My  mind swirled pleasantly this time, inviting the comfort of peace only  attained through sleep.</p>
<p>“Night…” Out came a barely  audible whisper.</p>
