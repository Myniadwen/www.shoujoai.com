<a href="../smoon/timeluv-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>	Kira tensed and allowed herself to go fully vampiric as she stared 
down the man before her. Her recently fed fangs springing from her gums, 
her eyes glowing blue. She growled and moved in front of Ami and Rei.
	&quot;What the hell are you doing here?&quot; She demanded and he laughed, 
though his voice was devoid of warmth.
	&quot; I just wanted to see what about these girls was so special that 
you would be so possessive about them.&quot; He said, uncrossing his arms. 
She only snarled.
	&quot;I haven&#39;t shared with you in centuries. What do you care?&quot; He 
laughed and clucked his tongue at her.
	&quot; Kira-chan, how long have I known you? I knew you were acting 
different. I knew they were different. But that they were senshi...that 
she was. By the Gods you know how to pick them.&quot; He commended and moved 
forward. Kira only stood straighter and met his eyes as they narrowed at 
her insolence. &quot; What are you doing? Why would you protect them? I&#39;m 
sorry your little girlfriend turned out to be one of them but she and 
they are still the Queen&#39;s protectors. And, if you know who the others 
are you&#39;d be best to fess up so I and some select others can go and have 
some real fun.&quot; He moved forward again, his eyes glowing red with the 
thought of playing with a senshi but Kira moved fully in front of the 
girls. Ami shivered and tightened he robe around her, ducking behind 
Kira slightly. Rei seconded her motions though she seemed more angry 
than afraid.
	&quot; Back off.&quot; Kira hissed and Akio&#39;s eyes widened slightly.
	&quot; What on this Earth is wrong with you Kira? They are senshi!&quot; He 
spat the word out and growled.&quot; They are protectors, defenders of the 
woman who kept us all enslaved for so long! We deserve revenge for the 
way we were treated. We deserve them.&quot; He growled at Kira&#39;s defensive 
posture and charged forward, hoping to spring past her. But she was just 
as fast and slammed him to the side just as he reached her. He spun, 
ready to pounce but her foot met his temple and he stumbled back wards. 
When his vision cleared he looked up to see Kira there, her fists 
clenched and a look of determination in her eyes that he had not seen 
for over a thousand years. Realizing that he could not beat her one on 
one he stood slowly and straightened his suit front.
	&quot; Leave.&quot; She commanded and he tightened his tie before looking up 
at her again.
	&quot; Very well, I will go. But be assured Kira-chan, I will return 
with others. We will claim our revenge, with or without your support.&quot; 
With that he disappeared and Kira remained tense for a few moments 
before slumping slightly. She sighed and turned to Ami and Rei who 
looked up at her, curiosity and fear in their eyes.
	&quot; We need to leave, now.&quot; She said and Ami whimpered.
	&quot; Where will we go?&quot; She asked and watched as Kira ran back and 
forth between rooms gathering things.
	&quot; I have a place that I know he doesn&#39;t know about. You two will 
be safe there as long as we go before he returns. You should gather some 
clothes.&quot; Ami and Rei both nodded and ran to their room to pack. Kira 
moved into her own room and tucked the henshin wands in her pocket. She 
destroyed the video taping equipment, and making sure nothing else 
incriminating was around returned to the main room where a now fully 
dressed Ami and Rei stood, bags in hand. She stood in front of them and 
motioned with her hands. They didn&#39;t even hesitate as they moved to her. 
She wrapped an arm around both of them and concentrating slightly pulled 
them all to her second home. Ami and Rei stepped back and looked around 
curiously at their new place.
	&quot; Sorry it&#39;s so much smaller than my other place.&quot; Kira said 
apologetically. &quot; I don&#39;t come here all that often. That&#39;s also why 
there isn&#39;t much here.&quot; Looking around Rei had to agree that it was 
sparsely decorated compared to the other house. The room they were in 
which Rei assumed was the living room wasn&#39;t much bigger than her and 
Ami&#39;s room had been. Of course their room had been huge compared to her 
own house so this place was still big. Seeing their nervousness she 
smiled at them.
	&quot; Don&#39;t worry, he won&#39;t find us here. He knew about that other 
place, and it was in the demon realm. He won&#39;t ever think to look here, 
and even if he does he has no way to track us.&quot;
	&quot; Was that Akio-san?&quot; Rei asked curiously and Kira nodded.
	&quot; Yeah. That was him.&quot; She said and Rei rolled her eyes.
	&quot; You have great taste in company.&quot; She said dryly and Kira stuck 
out her tongue.
	&quot; I picked you two didn&#39;t I? &quot; She asked and enjoyed the face Rei 
made. &quot; Like I said don&#39;t worry, he won&#39;t find us here.&quot;
	&quot;Why? Where are we?&quot; Ami asked, setting her bag on the couch and 
almost wincing at the small puff of dust that swirled up. Kira grimaced 
slightly too and sighed. It would take some work to get this place 
worthy of their vacation. Forcing a grin she patted the back of the 
couch, ignoring the cloud it produced.
	&quot; Welcome back to Japan girls.&quot; She announced and they both looked 
up in shock.
	&quot; We&#39;re back  in Japan?&quot; Rei asked incredulously, staring at a 
curtain covered window. Kira walked to it and opened the curtains 
revealing a bright sunny day.
	&quot; Yes we are. My home away from home.&quot; Ami got a curious look in 
her eyes and turned on Kira.
	&quot; Kira-chan, what did Akio mean when he said that Queen Serenity 
had enslaved you all?&quot; Rei started. She&#39;d been so afraid of Akio that 
she hadn&#39;t even thought of it. She too looked over at Kira who leaned up 
against the edge of the couch.
	&quot; I&#39;ve already told you that The Queen had a strict set of rules 
that the demons on Earth had to follow. What I didn&#39;t tell you is why we 
actually followed them instead of fighting back. As I&#39;m sure you know, 
the Queen and her crystal were pretty much pure &#39;good&#39;. It radiated 
everywhere and Earth was no exception. When Queen Serenity was still 
alive and the Millennium Kingdom was strong, her power of light, her 
&#39;good&#39;  kept the evil of all of the demons there in check. After she 
died we were all released and many grew super powerful when they reached 
their full potential. Unfortunately, doing that sort of pushes you 
completely over to the dark side which is why I&#39;ve resisted. It&#39;s like 
letting go of the last good in you. But many others, like Akio, are now 
true full-blooded demons. It&#39;s an extra burst of power to be sure, but 
it&#39;s hard to come back from. But most of the demons that go that far 
don&#39;t have a reason to come back anyway. Most demons now resent Queen 
Serenity and by-proxy her protectors for keeping them in check for so 
long.&quot;
	They were all quiet for a while and Ami looked up at Kira 
curiously.
	&quot; You said you hated Queen Serenity because of the her rule about 
demons and senshi. Do you also hate her for keeping you in check?&quot; Kira 
sat down on the armrest of the couch and stared at her hands.
	&quot; Actually, I don&#39;t. For as much as I hate her for her stupid 
rules, I&#39;d of much rather had her rule than demons like Akio.&quot;
	&quot; Really?&quot; Rei asked in shock. Kira just shrugged her shoulders 
and smiled at them.
	&quot; Just because I am a demon doesn&#39;t mean I agree with every other 
demon alive. Some of them are just too... bloodthirsty and, well, evil 
for me.&quot; Ami shifted in her seat and Rei looked up hesitantly.
	&quot; Do you think that, maybe the reason you aren&#39;t evil, why you 
haven&#39;t given in, is because of.... because you are in love with 
Setsuna-san?&quot; She asked and Kira inhaled sharply, looking up at Rei. Rei 
looked down and shifted. &quot; I mean, I can only imagine how much it must 
of hurt you when she left but... even you said that you had been sad 
this whole time because you couldn&#39;t be with her. And that you cursed 
that you were a demon at all. Maybe you sensed the good in her then, and 
wanted to be good for her, even if you couldn&#39;t be with her.&quot; Kira 
looked back down, tumbling Rei&#39;s words in her head. With a small laugh 
she walked over to the window and stared out it.
	&quot; You know, you just might be right Rei-chan.&quot; She said and both 
Rei and Ami let out a small breath of relief that she wasn&#39;t mad. &quot; For 
as much as I want to hate her for leaving me like that, I did keep her 
in mind for a thousand years. And even now, knowing what she was and 
what she really did, I&#39;m mad but mostly... mostly...&quot; She trailed off, 
her eyes tearing and Ami watched her sadly.
	&quot; Mostly?&quot; She encouraged and Kira took a ragged breath.
	&quot; Mostly, I just wish that it could be different now, and that we 
could be together again.&quot; With heavy sigh she reached up and touched the 
window pane lightly, imagining Setsuna somewhere not too far away. &quot; I 
really do miss her.... my Setsuna-chan.&quot; She whispered quietly and Rei 
stared out the window too, seeing Usagi and Minako&#39;s faces in the 
reflection. 
	&quot; Mina-chan.&quot; She said quietly, feeling contemplative and Kira was 
pulled from her reverie. She watched Rei stare out the window and saw 
Ami doing the same thing. Wanting to ease the mood and drive the last 
remnants of Akio away she walked up behind Ami and wrapped her arms 
around the girls midsection. Ami almost yelped in surprise having been 
roughly pulled from her thoughts and Rei looked over sharply.
     &quot; I know you&#39;re not thinking about running away Rei-chan.&quot; Kira 
said quietly, tightening her hold on Ami. Ami whimpered slightly and Rei 
regarded Kira with a raised eyebrow, not really believing that Kira was 
threatening Ami.
	&quot; Why? Are you going to hurt her if I do?&quot; She asked, also trying 
to get back into a better mood and Ami&#39;s eyes widened significantly. 
Kira only laughed aloud and bent slightly, nuzzling Ami&#39;s neck and 
drawing a soft sigh from the smaller girl.
	&quot; Heavens no. I just didn&#39;t think you would want to leave Ami-chan 
here behind.&quot; She teased and Rei crossed her arms, staring at the 
red-head defiantly.
	&quot; What makes you think she wouldn&#39;t come with me?&quot; Rei asked. Ami 
also looked over her shoulder to see Kira&#39;s response. Kira looked into 
Ami&#39;s eyes before looking at Rei playfully.
	&quot; You were there earlier weren&#39;t you Rei-chan? So it should be 
obvious even to you how much Ami-chan likes me.&quot; She said teasingly, 
letting one hand travel far enough down on Ami&#39;s front to make sure they 
both knew what she was talking about. Ami got it and turned a brilliant 
red ducking her eyes and squirming a little. Rei couldn&#39;t help laughing 
and teased Ami as well.
	&quot; You do have point there Kira-chan. Ami certainly does seem to 
like your attentions quite a bit.&quot; Ami flushed darker and sighed heavily 
as both Kira and Rei laughed at her expense. But, feeling strangely 
relaxed with Kira&#39;s arms around her she looked up at Rei&#39;s smiling face. 
* Hmmm, I wonder how much Rei would enjoy Kira&#39;s &#39;attentions&#39;?* As the 
thought grew in her mind an almost evil grin came to her and she smiled, 
contemplating her plot of revenge.
