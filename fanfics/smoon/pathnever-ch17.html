<p><strong><u>A/N:</u></strong>Things will be  clearer in the next chapter. If you don’t understand what just  happened in this one, don’t worry about  it too much.</p>
<p><strong><u>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</u></strong></p>
<p><u>Uranus’s  POV, Marine Cathedral</u></p>
<p><u></u>Aqua eyes that seemed to have  lost their light. They contained nothing of the childish nature from  the one morning we all spent together. They neither contained that  hatred I saw in the underground parkade. Instead it had grown deeper.  The hate didn’t stop at us this time. It was strong resentment that  seeped through the entire room.</p>
<p>How could someone harbor so  much hatred for people that were her friends?</p>
<p>The time portal  opened directly behind the girl.</p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p><u>“</u>Kaiya!”</p>
<p>She  stepped back into the beam of light with her face set in a defiant  and determined line. There was no room for hesitation.</p>
<p>I held my hand out to her, wanting to stop her from going but it  was hopeless, I knew it was; she was too far away. I doubt even the  wind could’ve caught her before she took that one step.</p>
<p>Kaiya  was…</p>
<p>I saw the portal close, leaving nothing but open  space.</p>
<p>‘<em>Heir to the throne of Uranus and Neptune, Tenoh  Kaiya!’</em></p>
<p>Heir…to the throne?</p>
<p>Of…Uranus and  Neptune?</p>
<p><strong>Throb!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Gah!” I fell to my knees  and grasped my head. Damn…it’s back! My head continued to throb,  each beat becoming more painful the last. “Gah—Ah!-AH!” I  wanted to slam it against the floor and knock myself out; anything to  stop this growing pain. I could feel the feeling build momentum,  bringing voices and images to mind, ones that I’ve haven’t seen  or heard for some time. It scared me. I couldn’t stop  it.</p>
<p>What’s…happening to me?</p>
<p>Through pained eyes I  glanced over to Michi and saw she was suffering as I  was.</p>
<p>What’s…happening to <em>us</em>?</p>
<p><em>‘Then that  means?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Yes. Haruka, I’m  pregnant!’</em></p>
<p><strong>THROB!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“AAAAAHHHHHHHH!”</p>
<p><u>Memory:  Crystal Tokyo</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>“Mamoru san!” I greeted the man.  He looked terrible.</em></p>
<p><em>“Thank you for coming. I’m sorry, I’ve  been such a nervous wreck lately. Please excuse my appearance.” The  black haired man’s hair stuck up everywhere and it appeared he  hadn’t shaved his face for days.</em></p>
<p>“<em>It’s completely understandable, I mean,  it’s not everyday that your child will be born.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Oh…” I watched him bury his face in one  hand. “Don’t remind me…”He groaned.</em></p>
<p>“Well I’m here. If you want to talk about  something, anything, I’ll be more than happy to listen.”</p>
<p>“<em>Yes, that’s  exactly what I need right now. Please, come in.”</em></p>
<p><strong>FLASH</strong></p>
<p><u>Memory:  Palace of Uranus, Garden</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>“Haruka!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Haruka papa.”</em></p>
<p><em>Before I could blink Michi was running towards  me and in turn, I spread my arms to embrace her. This is what I  missed, not those stupid business meetings! </em></p>
<p>“<em>Hey there.” I leaned down and gave her a  peck on the cheek. “Miss me much?”</em></p>
<p><em>She returned the peck with a passionate kiss on  my lips. “What do you think?” That maybe I should be gone on  those business trips longer!</em></p>
<p>“Hmm…I’ll take that as a ‘yes’.” I  grinned, trying to be slightly serious. I then noticed that our  daughter was here as well. “Hey kid, long time no see.”</p>
<p>“<em>Is that supposed to be a joke?” Hotaru  sarcastically inquired, crossing her arms stubbornly. I felt my eyes  widen at the gesture.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Woah! You’ve been practicing haven’t  you?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Actually she has.” Michi spoke up. I could  tell; Hotaru was usually much more reserved.</em></p>
<p>“<em>For…?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>That’s right Haruka papa, you guessed it.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Hmm…Then that means?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Yes. Haruka, I’m  pregnant!”</em></p>
<p><strong>FLASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Ugh…W-What…?</p>
<p><u>Memory:  Beach outside Michiru’s house</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>‘Until she’s  shot right?’ I heard my inner voice ask. Yes…There’s no other  way! I despaired. ‘She could die…’ We all die at some point.  ‘But not all people are murdered by you.’ I choked back a gasp  and closed my eyes tightly. The memory of my father brutally  murdering my mother came flooding back. Everything I felt then…The  anger, sorrow, sadness and hatred…</em></p>
<p>‘<em>You’ll be just  like him.’ I’ll…become like him?</em></p>
<p><strong>FLASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Just…like  him?</p>
<p><em>‘I won’t let that happen!’</em></p>
<p><u>Memory:  Hometown</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>“…Don’t laugh, okay? But I used to  have this dream that I could fly.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>What?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I know it’s kind of weird, but I was the  wind.”</em></p>
<p><em>She paused momentarily looking thoughtful. “So  what happened?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Well…” I  carefully chose my words. “There was nothing but blue sky with the  ocean beneath me. But then I reached the shore and I saw myself, as a  person staring at the water. They didn’t seem to notice me,  just…staring. It was kind of creepy actually. Then I sudden became  closer and closer… until I hit myself! That was when I woke  up.”</em></p>
<p><strong>FLASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>That’s  right…I…</p>
<p><u>Memory: Hometown past</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>“The  kids say that you’ve been staring out at the ocean for five days  straight…Why?”</em></p>
<p><em>My mind froze for a moment; I thought she was  going to ask me something else…Which was totally impossible.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Oh, that? It’s nothing really.” I  covered up. Michi wouldn’t know and I promised I wouldn’t spill.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Nothing?” She almost sounded angry. Did I  say something wrong?</em></p>
<p><em>Times like this I used to hold her and tell her  that I loved her, but I can’t do that here…So instead, I did the  next best; I softly gripped her shoulders and asked, “What’s  wrong? What’s bothering you?”</em></p>
<p><em>She suddenly blurted, “Why did you run away?”  W-What did she say? I searched her eyes, looking for the Michi I  knew. Those eyes…all those years that we lived together were living  strong in those swirling emotions. It was her!<br />
</em></p>
<p>“You…followed.” My eyes widened, still  unable to believe that this was nothing more than another dream. The  next thing I knew, I was crying. “Why…?”</p>
<p><strong>FLASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  ran away…</p>
<p>I slowly opened my eyes as my own power pulsed  inside me. The throbbing had died down, leaving a cool, clear feeling  behind. With amusement I watched my power as it became visible,  showing itself only as a bright gold light being emitted from my  form. The wind in the area picked up and encircled the room, growing  the strongest near me. I was not afraid or startled because this new  strength was mine… I recognized it and welcomed it as one would an  old friend.</p>
<p>I outstretched my hand and watched the wind and  my power fuse, becoming a transparent golden wind that circled around  my arm. It was warm, reminding me of my true home. That home wasn’t  the small town Michi and I grew up in or this city…</p>
<p>I  remember now. All of it.</p>
<p>‘Why! Why did you  leave!’</p>
<p>…So that’s what  she meant…</p>
<p>“Pluto, what’s happening to them?” Sailor  Moon whispered.</p>
<p>The guardian of time gave a small sigh and  applied pressure to the bridge of her nose as though she knew this  would happen. It was just like her.</p>
<p>“Their memory seals have  been broken.”</p>
<p>“Memory seals?” The other scouts asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. The people you see before you are not who you know  them to be.”</p>
<p>My power came under control and returned  inside my body. I noticed that Michi’s power had returned to her as  well.</p>
<p>“With their memories awakened they are no longer the  ordinary Sailor Soldiers of this time but the rulers of Uranus and  Neptune of the future.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, Marine  Cathedral</u></p>
<p><u></u>I had forgotten all the battles and  hardships we endured to reach who we were. I had also forgotten all  of the friends I watched die from old age. Yet…it does not sadden  me. With this old knowledge newly acquired I feel complete. I no  longer will fret over the reoccurring dreams for I now see they were  lost memories. My memories…</p>
<p>Perhaps…we will see  each other again one day. It is my earnest wish that we may have such  a chance. Although by then you may feel nothing but hatred towards  us, I want you to know one thing…If only this much…I love you and  always will.</p>
<p>The baby  who cried in the dream was mine. The same baby Haruka and I named  before Haruka ran off and I followed.</p>
<p>Without an accusing  eye I looked over to my awakened partner. She of course averted my  gaze. It was a habit she had carried with her throughout the years,  perhaps one that was carved into her soul itself. Who she was, what  she did, I still love her. I continued to watch her, taking notice  that her sailor fuku had vanished. In its place was Ruka’s normal  dress suit she would wear to her meetings. It was very similar to her  suits in this time, being gold in color but decorated more formally.  As for myself, it appeared that I was in my favorite dress Pluto had  given me on one of my birthdays.</p>
<p>“It is nice to see you  again Setsuna.” I offered the gatekeeper of time. After all, with  her help I was able to have the chance to find Ruka again.</p>
<p>She  nodded, looking slightly tense. “Do you remember everything  now?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” To my right, Ruka had merely offered a  nod.</p>
<p>“Tell me Setsuna, why is Kaiya here?” My blonde  partner now asked. It had puzzled me as well, why and how had our  daughter come to the past? It also made me sad as I remembered our  initial meetings up to where we are now. There were so many lost  opportunities.</p>
<p>“She came here on her own accord.  Unfortunately I am still unsure of all the details but apparently she  had acquired a time key.”</p>
<p>Ruka narrowed her eyes. “I  see…”</p>
<p>“It is crucial that she returns to the future.”  Setsuna continued.</p>
<p>“Why is that? Has something happened?”  I was now worried. What has happened during our absence?</p>
<p>“The  Queen has determined that all first born heirs must gather for  training. All of them.” She stressed.</p>
<p>Then a new enemy has  arrived.</p>
<p>“The other planet rulers are becoming impatient,  they believe we are trying to protect Kaiya more so than the other  heirs. Although we know our fellow senshi would not wish to start a  war with one another their people are a different concern.”</p>
<p>Ruka  nodded to me. “We understand.” She replied with her formal tone.  “However we must firstly deal with the present problem at hand or  there will be no future to protect.”</p>
<p>“Which is why I  propose we deal with the source directly.” Pluto repeated.</p>
<p>“To  destroy Hotaru?” The idea brought up uncertainties already.  Mothering the girl for all those centuries was bound to cause some  problems in this mission. I wished to see her and protect her after  all this time, not to destroy her. “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Both  your actions and Kaiya’s have altered the normal course of time. I  can no longer see the future in this period.”</p>
<p>“…And if  the girl is eliminated?” Ruka asked.</p>
<p>“She will disappear  in both times.”</p>
<p><strong>DOOOOOOOM</strong></p>
<p>“Now  if you will excuse me, I must find Kaiya.”</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, time corridor</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Hah! Hah! Hah!”</p>
<p><strong>Tup!  Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I raced down pathway, looking for an  appropriate place to exit. I couldn’t ask the time key to take me  to Hotaru’s place; who knows where I will end up. Maybe I would’ve  end up in their bathroom or some other ridiculous place! (That would  be hard to talk my way out of) I was only lucky that the key dropped  me off along one of the main corridors in the cathedral.</p>
<p>In  the meantime, I should find a place to bail out and ditch this key. I  bet Pluto has some sort of tracking sense on these things. She is the  keeper of time after all.</p>
<p>“Hah! Hah! Hah!”</p>
<p>I  need…someplace to throw her off but close enough that I can get to  Hotaru’s house.</p>
<p><strong>Ping!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My eyes darted back  behind me, peering over my shoulder. I could not see her figure and  the corridor still looked empty. The same void of swirling purple lay  out behind me without disturbance. However, I think she’s caught  on…and she isn’t far!</p>
<p>Quick, need a place!</p>
<p>What  about…Ah, I got it!</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Crown  Arcade</u></p>
<p><u></u>“I’d like to see Pluto get that key  now.”</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I ran off from the  crane game machine, imagining poor Pluto trying to get that key back.  Unless she’s a pro gamer or has a lot of coins handy, I doubt she’s  going to get it anytime soon. Which means more time for me.</p>
<p>If  she wants to go back to the future, she’s going to have to drag  me!</p>
<p><u>Hotaru’s House</u></p>
<p><u></u>I rang the  doorbell. Come on, come on! Someone open it, I silently begged. Every  so often my eyes would dart to the sides for any signs of people or  behind at their house gate. If they really wanted to, the others  could easily surround us here; it was just too small of a space.  Still though, I hope it would take them quite some time to get back  to this side of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Click.<br />
  </strong><br />
  To my luck and  relief, it was someone I knew that opened the door.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Kaiya?”  Hotaru sleepily rubbed her eyes. I hadn’t checked the time for  awhile now. I wonder how late it was?</p>
<p>“Hi Hotaru! Want to go  see a star show?”</p>
<p>She gave me a confused look. “A star  show this early in the morning?” I could tell she was still waking  up from her dazed state. Sis used to be like that all the time back  at home; she would walk around although she was still partially  sleeping. Meaning she was aware for some things but was rather out of  it for others.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I mean the show they have at the star  observation center.” We could hide out there. It was generally  empty and secluded; it would be harder for the scouts to find us  there. They’d probably go looking for us at the park or the school  garden. Well…they’re about to find out that I’m not that  predictable.</p>
<p>“I don’t know…I think I’m supposed to be  sleeping.”</p>
<p>HUH? You can sleep there! I wanted to yell.  “Please? I won’t take ‘no’ for an answer.”</p>
<p>“…”  The girl sighed. “Okay but not too long all right? Papa might  worry.”</p>
<p><u>Stargazing Center</u></p>
<p><u></u>The both of  us walked in, only to see the place was completely vacated. For a  late night show, it doesn’t look like too many people are  interested…which is rather ironic since the stars shine their best  at these times. Some star lovers society is. Oh well, all the better  for us of course. I doubt the other scouts will find us here; it was  pretty well hidden from the main public roads.</p>
<p>“There’s  nobody here…” Hotaru nervously examined. “And cold…” She  shivered a bit.</p>
<p>“Here.” I gave her my sweater. If I still  had my powers I could have called up my cloak or something; it would  have been more suitable for this weather. What do they do here  anyway? Keep the air conditioning on? It was warmer outside then in  here! “But at least we can see the stars here.” I tried to put a  positive spin on things.</p>
<p>Hotaru nodded, agreeing with me.  “They are pretty.”</p>
<p>We both took seats in the front and  sat in silence, watching the lights up in the sky. They seemed to  have a transparent dome up above, where one could see the sky without  too much difficulty. Which was nice I thought. It would have been a  pain trying to turn on that machine; not that I couldn’t but it  could take some time and I was a bit tired from running around.</p>
<p>I really wanted to sleep but something else plagued my  mind. It wasn’t just the other Sailor Senshi that bothered me. I  wondered if I should tell Hotaru that someone is after her? If we  stay here for awhile, she might become suspicious that we aren’t  only here for the star show. I’d have to tell her something that  would keep her here. I mean, there is the possibility that she’d  panic if I told her the truth but it might give her a heart attack or  a re-lapse if it all hit her at once.</p>
<p>As I pondered the  thought, I counted off the scouts and their respective planets. The  moon (Usagi), Mercury (Ami), Venus (Minako), Mars (Rei), Jupiter  (Makoto), Saturn…Hotaru?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I wonder if  she has any idea about that…</p>
<p>“What do you think of the  planet Saturn?” I tried to casually ask, watchful of her  reaction.</p>
<p>“…I’m not sure…” However, to me she looked  mesmerized by the planet above. I guess she really has no clue.  Although…that doesn’t mean her subconscious-ness is entirely  asleep.</p>
<p>She began to shuffle uncomfortably in her  seat.</p>
<p>“Something wrong?”</p>
<p>“After today, I… I  don’t think we should see each other anymore.” She  whispered.</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“There’s something  wrong…with me.” She was afraid of herself? “Like there’s  another me.” I saw her flinch back, as if someone was going to hit  her.</p>
<p>‘Another me?’ Then maybe I was wrong, maybe she does  know. Many people do fear the scout of destruction and rebirth while  some even cursed her. That much I knew. However, in this age where  Sailor Senshi powers were unknown to others and their identities were  secret, I suppose she was afraid that I’d think her as a monster or  worse. Like those brats at the park. As much as I’d like to tell  her about myself, I couldn’t. At the moment, I can’t call out my  own powers, making me as good as a normal human with martial arts  training.</p>
<p>“…Don’t  worry about it.” I smiled and ruffled her hair a bit.</p>
<p>“You  don’t understand.” She tried again. “If I hurt you…”  Hotaru’s voice trailed off.</p>
<p>I sighed. She’s worrying  about hurting me? She should be worried about the Senshi team  destroying her. This would be  a good a time as any to tell her.</p>
<p>“Hotaru…listen close.  You shouldn’t worry about hurting me; we should be worrying about  the others. There are some powerful people after you.” She gasped,  shock evident in her eyes. “So stay close okay? I’ll do what I  can but I can’t guarantee anything.” And this time, I really  couldn’t.</p>
<p>Next thing I knew she was clinging onto me. I  could easily pry her off, she wasn’t too strong…but that would be  plain mean wouldn’t it? When I felt her against me, I could also  feel her warmth. It made me realize how cold it really was in here; I  never noticed that I was actually cold until now. My arms came around  and gave her a comforting hug. When I was a kid, our roles were  reversed. It made me wonder how this worked, how the little sister  ends up being the big sis.</p>
<p><strong>Ping!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My hands  clamped down and scooped Hotaru up into my arms as the incoming fire  came, landing us both on the stage.</p>
<p>“Pluto deadly  scream!”</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p><strong>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRR-  BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>They’re here…I growled quietly, trying to sense  if the inners had arrived as well. No sooner had I thought that, the  younger scouts blocked one exit, while the outers had the other  covered. Both aisles were definitely well guarded now. I didn’t  have much of a choice; I might have to go through them.</p>
<p>But it  bothered me, how did they find us?</p>
<p>“Hand over the girl.”  Uranus said.</p>
<p>I blinked, feeling confusion distorting my  senses. Something wasn’t right about Uranus and Neptune. They…were  different. Stronger? Definitely. But there was so much more to that.  It was like their auras’ had matured to a level that required  years, centuries even to achieve!</p>
<p>What the hell was going on  here?</p>
<p>“Are you siding with them?” Pluto asked. Her  piercing eyes looked threatening. What was she going to do? Kill  me?</p>
<p>I felt Hotaru’s grip tighten on my shirt. She was  scared, shaking even. It…made me angry.</p>
<p>“Hotaru!”  Chibimoon cried out, only Hotaru didn’t recognize her young friend.  In response the dark haired girl hid her face against my shirt.</p>
<p>I  tried to bring up a map of this place in my mind, searching my memory  for some exit. The senshi had two of them covered, however, if I  could get to the deck above them…</p>
<p>I’m going to require a  little assistance!</p>
<p>Without another thought I picked up and  threw a chair in Venus’s direction, anticipating her reaction.  Let’s see it, I silently thought.</p>
<p>“Venus…”</p>
<p>In  that instant I shot forward.</p>
<p>“Love-me CHAIN!”</p>
<p><strong>Crack!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  chair had broken mid-air, absorbing most of the girl’s attack.  Seeing my chance I leapt up onto the solid metal and from there,  leapt up onto the balcony above.</p>
<p>“Shit!” Someone  shouted.</p>
<p>I ran forward towards the window glass.</p>
<p>“Hang  on!” I shouted to Hotaru and I smashed my side against it,  shattering it as we broke through the transparent barrier.</p>
<p><strong>CRASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>At first contact on the ground I just  ran. I didn’t care where; anywhere was fine!</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup!  Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Deserted Park Area</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Sparkling  Wide PRESSURE!”</p>
<p><strong>BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Geh…” The  explosions continued behind me, catching up  steadily.</p>
<p><strong>Plip.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Something wet hit my cheek. Was  it raining? Oh no! This couldn’t be happening; I looked down at  Hotaru, her breathing was hard and short. This weather is going to  make it worse! What do I do? What can I do? Desperation now consumed  me, rising the panic I felt. I had to get her some shelter. But how?  The senshi were everywhere, closing in at all angles.</p>
<p><strong>TUP!  TUP! TUP! TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Trapped within  a circle.</p>
<p><strong>DOOOOM</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Uranus was the first to step  forward. “Why are you being so stubborn? Shouldn’t you kids  listen to your parents?”</p>
<p><strong>LUBB DUBB!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“What…did  you say?”</p>
<p>“…” The taller blonde narrowed her eyes,  watching me cautiously.</p>
<p>Does that means she actually knows?  That she remembers everything? The piece of hatred I had re-lit,  fuelled by her cold words. I had my own questions that I needed to be  answered.</p>
<p>“Tell me this first then…why did you  leave?”</p>
<p>There was a dead silence other than the sound of the  falling rain.</p>
<p>“Why I left?” Because you left, Michiru went  after you! It’s all your fault! “I left…because…” Uranus’s  voice trailed off, her gaze watched the ground now as the rain drops  creating tiny, short ripples.</p>
<p>“What? What did you say?”  My heart pounded in my ears. I could barely hear her.</p>
<p>“I  left because…you…”</p>
<p>“…Speak up dammit! Stop  mumbling!”</p>
<p>Haruka took a deep breath. “I LEFT BECAUSE OF  YOU!” She finally shouted, her fists clenched.</p>
<p>“…” I  stepped back, absorbing the words best I could but to no avail. What?  B-Because…of me?</p>
<p>‘…” I began to chuckle. It was  funny, all because of me, she said it was all because of me. For a  moment I couldn’t tell if I wanted to laugh or cry. No, I  definitely didn’t want to cry. I could feel my body shake. Before I  knew it I was laughing full out, surely making the other scouts think  I had gone over the edge. “That so?” My voice came out in a  whispery tone. I could hardly recognize it myself, even it sounded  foreign to me. “Tell me Uranus, do you remember your elite  guard?”</p>
<p>The wind senshi said nothing and remained looking  down, refusing to meet my gaze.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you something  about your most trusted guard…”</p>
<p><u>Memory: Palace of  Uranus</u></p>
<p><u></u>It was the first time sis was away. I was  about seven at the time and she thought that I would be okay to be  left alone now; she used to keep her eye on me constantly but I  wasn’t sure why. For the most part, growing up since I was born I  had ‘lived’ in my room. People would come and go; the maids would  routinely drop off the food three times a day and that would be it.  Hotaru was the only person who would actually stay with me.</p>
<p>We  did a lot of things together. Sometimes we’d play board games or  video games. At other times, she’d spend time reading to me and  trying to teach me how to read and write.</p>
<p>I  remember one time I asked her why she couldn’t have someone else  teach me this stuff and she only replied, ‘I don’t think that’s  such a good idea…’. When I asked why, she smiled and said,  ‘Because I love you so much that I want you to myself’.</p>
<p>Love…?  I never questioned it. If she said it was love, then I believed her.  I loved my big sis more than anyone else.</p>
<p>The one day she  didn’t come to see me as usual it piqued my curiosity.</p>
<p>“Where’s  sis?” I asked myself. I couldn’t come up with any explanation for  her absence so I decided that maybe I should go find her.</p>
<p>My  first time out of my room…I opened the large door, allowing myself  to memorize the sound of it opening.</p>
<p><strong>Creeeeeeak.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  poked my head out first, curious as to what I might see. So far, I  learned that the palace’s corridors were blue, the walls were laced  with gold lining. The first thing I did as I left the room was walk  up and touch one of the white pillars, admiring its sturdiness. It  was marble and felt so smooth when I ran my small hand down  it.</p>
<p>Liking what I saw, I continued to walk down the corridor,  hoping to meet up with some of the staff. Sis said the reason I never  see them was because they were always busy. So maybe…They would let  me help them? Maybe we could become friends! I’ve never really had  any, so the thought excited me.</p>
<p>I  was such a naïve child back then…</p>
<p>Should I  go…this way? I made a right turn and had somehow ended up in this  huge room. Already I knew I was lost and I almost started crying  right there on the spot.</p>
<p>“A child? Oh dear, are you lost?”  I turned around and saw it was one of the maids. She seemed like a  nice person.</p>
<p>I nodded. “Where am I?”</p>
<p>“The  ballroom. What’s your name? Are your parents here for a  visit?”</p>
<p>“My parents? I-I don’t know where they  are…”</p>
<p>The lady patted me on the head. “There, there,  we’ll find them.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>She nodded  and smiled. “So what’s your name?”</p>
<p>I had to think about  it for a moment; no one ever asked me that question before. “Tenoh,  Kaiya.”</p>
<p>I must have said something wrong because the woman  suddenly turned and began walking away.</p>
<p>“Hey!” I called  out but she had already left. “What…did I do wrong?”</p>
<p>To  my luck I was found by your elite guards next…</p>
<p>“Well,  well, look at what we have here?”</p>
<p>The man in blue and gold  armor towered over me. He was huge! I blinked, unsure of what to do.  There were others behind him, all in the same dress. I had a bad vibe  about them…just something inside told me so. But what could I do?  Fear had already became a close friend of mine in the span of a few  shorts hours. I was too afraid to do anything; I didn’t want  another person to walk out on me, just like that lady…</p>
<p>“So  you’re the brat.” Their leader mumbled. “The maid was saying  you were wandering around. What made you come out of that little cage  of yours? Were you trying to run away?”</p>
<p>“I…” I tried  to back up but I tripped on my own feet and fell.</p>
<p>The men  laughed. “The little kid tripped. Want a hand?” I saw one of them  extend an open palm to me. I scooted back, away from it; it was three  sizes larger than my own. The pain it could inflict if it hit me…</p>
<p>“I  knew it…” Their leader stared down at me. “You’re a coward,  just like your bloody parents!”</p>
<p>What? He can’t insult my  parents! “Shut up! I don’t believe you!” He’s lying.</p>
<p>“What’s  that? Aww, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Looks like you made her  cry.” Someone in the crowd jeered.</p>
<p>My parents aren’t  cowards…I had seen portraits of them in a few picture albums and  they looked like strong people. I loved their smiles, the bond they  both shared. They couldn’t be bad…They just can’t…My parents  aren’t bad people. They…gave me a name. Kaiya, Tenoh Kaiya. It’s  mine…</p>
<p>These people…were making me angry.</p>
<p>“Whittle  baby is all alone without that sister with a superior complex  hovering around. Ha! Hey kid, did you know she was adopted? She’s  not even your real sister!”</p>
<p>The comment jolted me out of my  crying.</p>
<p>“Shut up…” I don’t care. Sis will always be  sis to me…</p>
<p>“Crying is fer weaklings!” Suddenly the giant  man gripped a chunk of my hair and forced me to look up. “But don’t  worry kid, we’ll make sure…” He pronounced each word slowly as  if I were stupid, “little freak, you…won’t end up…like  certain freaks.” He then he threw me back down, I felt my head hit  the floor with a thud.</p>
<p><strong>Lubb  Dubb!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Shakily I pushed myself back onto my knees  and then up onto my legs. Everything hurt.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“We  aren’t freaks…”</p>
<p>“All Sailor Senshi are freaks, a bunch  of witches with unnatural powers.”</p>
<p>Shut up! Shut up! Shut  up! Shut UP!</p>
<p>“Your sis is one of them too. And so…are-  Huh?”</p>
<p>“Boss man, you might want to step away…” The  rest of the men began to back up as a golden power began to pulse  from my tiny body.</p>
<p><strong>LUBB DUBB!</strong></p>
<p>“SHUT UP!  HAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><strong>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRL-KABLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“GAAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><u>End  memory</u></p>
<p><u></u>“My hands were all torn up, covered with  blood. It was the first time I’ve ever used my powers.” I never  knew I could do something like that. It just…happened. “When sis  got back, she and the others decided it would for the best to seal up  my powers. They never thought they would manifest so soon…”</p>
<p>“What  happened to those men?” Uranus asked in a low voice. She was  worried about those fools?</p>
<p>I was amused; surely she knew the  answer and yet she would dare to ask?</p>
<p>“I slaughtered them  all. And you know why? It was because of you.”</p>
<p><strong>DOOOOM</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  rain continued to fall, unaware of the predicament at hand. I stood  there, allowing myself to be drenched but held Hotaru close, wanting  to keep her dry as much as possible. She had fallen unconscious  during my story (which I was grateful for); she didn’t need to know  her friend was a murderer…</p>
<p>“Why…am I being so stubborn?”  Well now you know.</p>
<p>“Kaiya…”</p>
<p>“I won’t let you  or anyone touch sis!”</p>
<p>“She’s not your sister.” Neptune  had finally spoken. In turn, glared at her with disbelief and anger.  A mother forsaking her child? Even if adopted? I thought you of all  people would be better than that Michiru…</p>
<p>Uranus spoke  again. “Listen to me. This is our duty, we must destroy her to stop  the Silence.” Then in slow words she said, “I order you to hand  her over.”</p>
<p>Order? My arms trembled. Duty? Instinctively I  wanted to do as she told me but I shook my head held back. What was I  thinking? Those words used to be the center of my universe, needless  of my emotions. Everything I learned concerned our duty.  Responsibility of being a Senshi, of being the heir, belonging to the  royal family. Since a young age that was drilled into me and I never  questioned it. Sis…taught me all of it.</p>
<p>I’m sorry sis…</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I said NO!”</p>
<p>“Pluto…”  I turned my head to look as the words came. Everything seemed to move  in slow motion.</p>
<p>“Pluto, stop!” I heard my parents call  out. “Pluto!” The other senshi shouted.</p>
<p>“Deadly  Scream!”</p>
<p><strong>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRR-</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  gripped down tighter onto Hotaru, waiting for the deadly blast to  tear through my back and end my life. This was it.</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOOOOOOSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A  large gust shot upwards around us.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>When the attack did  not come I slowly opened my eyes and realized that I was alive. What  happened? I quickly turned on the spot to see a dark, transparent  wall blocking Pluto’s attack. Eventually the other woman’s attack  fizzled out without leaving so much as a scratch on the barrier.</p>
<p>I  was saved again…Damn! I…I need power. I need power to protect  her!</p>
<p>“Hotaru?” I saw her eyes had opened but they held a  strange light to them. They didn’t look as lively as I remembered  them. Rather, they appeared almost as one was in a trance.</p>
<p>The  girl slowly left my grasp until she stood in front of me on her own  two feet.</p>
<p>“Get away from her!” I heard Uranus  yell.</p>
<p>Hotaru slowly placed her hand on my shoulder and then  it moved downwards until it was directly over my heart.</p>
<p>What  is she…?</p>
<p>Her hand suddenly drove inwards into my flesh.  There was no blood, no ripping of flesh as I expected. Instead I felt  thorns of pain struck deep as my mind became clouded. I had trouble  remembering what was going on, where I was, who I was; everything was  a swirl of colors. At first it was deep red but then a purple fog  overtook it. The two began to mix until they began to move counter  clockwise. In its center was another pink sphere of light.</p>
<p>So  much energy…There was so much energy pouring into me that I could  no longer keep from yelling out in agony.</p>
<p>“AHHHHHHHHHHH!”</p>
<p><u>Uranus’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“AHHHHHHHHHHH!”</p>
<p>Damn, stupid  kid!</p>
<p>“Kaiya!” I tried calling out to her.</p>
<p>Purple  light pulsed around her body, sparking almost from the high  concentration of power. She’s received so much dark energy that the  air around her rose up, causing her blonde hair to flow out. And her  aura had changed as well, becoming darker than it was a split second  ago. I could no longer trace her normal blue; it was gone.</p>
<p>“…”  I watched as she slowly turned around, something new in her eyes.</p>
<p>“!” I bent my legs and dug my feet into the ground as the  power surge lashed out with a strong wind. “Geh…”</p>
<p>“Uranus  look out!” Michi called. Only it was too late, Kaiya had already  made it to me and delivered a punch to my head.</p>
<p><strong>WHUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“I  won’t…let you touch her.” She mumbled.</p>
<p>“Snap out of  it!” I growled.</p>
<p>“Sparkling wide  PRESSURE!”</p>
<p>“Venus love-me CHAIN!”</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOOOOOOSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>I  watched on as both attacks were blocked by another dark energy  wall.</p>
<p>Kaiya then moved as a blur, taking down each scout one  by one. I could barely keep up with her as she threw a series of  punches and kicks, sending each scout down on the slippery ground. It  wasn’t enough to kill but it would have definitely hurt.</p>
<p>She  then came at me.</p>
<p>“No you don’t!” I caught her mid-level  punched. I thought that it would have slowed her down but she  countered by following through her momentum and flipped over me. I  had no choice but to release my hold.</p>
<p>Behind!</p>
<p><strong>WHACK!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Gah!”  I fell forward.</p>
<p>This…wasn’t going to go anywhere. I  couldn’t attack without seriously hurting her. What we need to do  is to overpower her and then dispel that dark energy!</p>
<p>“Sailor  Moon, get ready!”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>I  stepped back, watching the scouts groan in pain as they got to their  feet. This power…It felt good. I never felt this strong before…I  clenched and unclenched my hands. All my wounds were healed as well.  However the entire situation still made me feel sad; I’d rather not  attack them like this but they keep getting in the way. If I left  them, they’d only come chasing us again anyway.</p>
<p>Across from  me I watched the three outer senshi line up horizontally in front of  Sailor Moon, almost as if they were forming a blockade.</p>
<p>What…were  they  planning?</p>
<p>“World…”</p>
<p>“Deep…”</p>
<p>“Pluto…”</p>
<p>“SHAKING!”</p>
<p>“SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p>“Deady  Scream!”</p>
<p>The three energy balls converged into one powerful  one. I response I lifted the barrier  again.</p>
<p><strong>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR-</strong></p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOOOOOOSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong>BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I blinked. Oh no!  They blew a hole in the barrier! My eyes fell upon Sailor Moon, who  had stepped forward with a strange wand in her  hands.</p>
<p>“Moon…Healing…ESCALATION!”</p>
<p>The silver  crystal on the wand’s end shot out a white light.</p>
<p>“Gah!”  I brought up the barrier again, but it was less than half of its  usual strength; using it so much had demanded so much of my  energy.</p>
<p>The light began to tear away at the remaining  barrier. Soon loose threads broke through. I felt my skin crawl as it  touched me. It was small at first but then as more and more of her  power touched me it began to burn. Eventually as more light hit me in  larger chunks, it created new wounds. There were scratches that lost  shreds of blood opening up all over my bare arms.</p>
<p>I realized  my body was trying to absorb it only it was no good. My head began to  throb in pain; there was too much energy at once! I can’t control  it!</p>
<p><strong>FSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I heard Hotaru teleport away from  behind me.</p>
<p>Hotaru-chan…I did it.</p>
<p>“Keep it up! I  think we’re getting through!” Someone on the other side  shouted.</p>
<p>I had no idea what they meant by ‘getting through’  but I sure did know when someone was trying to kill me. If this kept  up I’m done for!</p>
<p>“Nng…” My stance began to  falter.</p>
<p>‘You cannot stay!’</p>
<p>K-Chan?</p>
<p><strong>SHHHHHHINK.  FSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Neptune’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>When we had  thought the healing technique was making progress, Kaiya had  disappeared. The light had broken through the barrier but our  daughter was no longer there.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Pluto  stepped forward, walking by us all as she did so. Silently she  disappeared into another time portal without an explanation of what  was going on.</p>
<p><strong>Rumble…rumble…rumble…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  ground began to shake.</p>
<p>“Look over there!” Venus cried.</p>
<p>A  massive energy barrier had shot up across town in the area where the  Mugen Gakuen school was positioned. Instantly I recognized the sign.</p>
<p>“This is it.” Uranus muttered. I looked onwards, still  more concerned about where my children had gone. I knew instantly  that Ruka was also nervous although she would not admit it. I walked  forward beside her and took her hand in mine, as she used to.  Fighting, emotion-less machines we were not. We were worried parents.</p>
<p>I felt her gently squeeze back, understanding my  feelings.</p>
<p>Secretly I hoped…that they were all  right…</p>
