<p>As Rei hastily got into the cab, she glanced back at the airport and  noticed that Minako had briefly stood on the curb with a pained look in  her face. The miko could not keep her eyes off the idol as the cab  began to drive her away. She finally sighed and turned around. For a  moment, the miko was relieved to have escaped an encounter with Minako.  She did not want to deal with her just yet.</p>
<p>“Here for vacation miss?” asked the cab driver.</p>
<p>Rei  glanced at the rear view mirror, only to see the driver’s eyes staring  back at her. “No. I live here.” Her voice was stern and she gave an  expressionless face at the driver.</p>
<p>“Ah. Well then, where to?”</p>
<p>“Hikawa  Shrine,” Rei glanced outside the window as she began to find familiar  buildings that surrounded her. She missed the atmosphere from Kyoto.  Not everything was as urbanized as it was in Tokyo. Then they passed by  Crown Karaoke and a flood of memories came rushing back to Rei. She  shook her head to try and block them out for she was not ready to  relive them.</p>
<p>As they neared the Shrine, Rei started to wonder why  Kaori-sensei had sent her back home. Was she lacking something that  only the familiarity of her home could fulfill? Her memories drifted  back to Kyoto before she left for Tokyo.</p>
<p>“<em>All packed?” asked Kaori as she stood at the doorway of Rei’s room.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Hai,” replied Rei reluctantly as she propped the luggage up. Her face already depicted disappointment and her sensei noticed it.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Rei.  There are lessons in life that even we cannot teach. Although you have  become my best student, you are still lacking the spirit.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>But Kaori-sensei, I don’t understand. I’ve done everything there is to know. I’ve worked hard.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I  know, but your heart is not fully here. It’s as if you are only working  yourself to erase something from you mind…or perhaps someone?”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei  felt a tinge of nervousness tug her heart. She looked down at the  floor, know exactly what her sensei meant. Of course, she was an elder  miko and her ability surpassed Rei and could read her easily. And yet,  Rei thought that her efforts paid off in trying to conceal her heart  away. </em></p>
<p>“<em>I don’t want to go back…not now.”</em></p>
<p>“We're  here ma’am,” said the cab driver as Rei suddenly snapped out of her  daze. She looked at the very entrance to the temple and the infamous  staircase that lead to the shrine. Rei let out a deep breath, and  stepped out of the cab, paying the driver before rolling her luggage  away. She stood at the foot of the stairs and was trying to figure out  how she would manage to get her luggage past those steps. Just when she  was about to carry one suitcase, she found herself being greeted by a  young miko, about the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>“Hino-sensei! You’re back!” exclaimed the little apprentice.</p>
<p>“Hai,”  replied Rei. The younger miko helped Rei with her luggage and they were  finally able to store it in her room. As she exhaled, she looked at the  contents of her old room. Nothing had changed, and a few picture frames  were propped in the desk. <em>Welcome home Rei, </em>she thought.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ami  stepped outside the hospital, just finishing her long shift. She yawned  and then looked at the time. It was almost past eight. She smiled when  she realized that tomorrow was her day off. Praying that she would not  have to be called in the next day, Ami began to walk towards the subway.</p>
<p>“Ami-chan! Wait for me!” yelled someone.</p>
<p>Ami turned around and saw that it was Kozue who was jogging towards her. She smiled and waved back.</p>
<p>“Kami-sama, I thought I wouldn’t be able to catch you.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Oh nothing, I just wanted someone to walk with. I’m taking the subway home as well.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Excited about tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Hai.  This whole week had me worn out. Especially when they had a number of  people come in through the emergency room. The madness! Ryo-chan is  already complaining that I’m never home anymore. To think! I married  such a man. ”</p>
<p>“Haha, but we enjoy the hectic life nonetheless, and I’m pretty sure Ryo-san understands the demanding life of doctors.”</p>
<p>Kozue  nodded in agreement. Apparently, she was one of Ami’s comrades in the  hospital. They had both gone to study abroad together, later finding  that their calling was to go back to Japan. So here they were, two  twenty-year old girls doing their resident jobs at Juuban hospital. The  first time Ami met Kozue, she was surprised to discover that they were  the same age. It was Kozue who had recognized the genius, and squealed  in excitment to know that they were to be working together. As they  were at the subway station, they began to walk their separate ways.  Just when Ami had taken a seat, her phone began to ring. She was hoping  that it was not the hospital, and was glad to hear Makoto’s voice on  the other end of the line.</p>
<p>“Ami-chan! Are you busy?”</p>
<p>“No. I just got off my shift. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Usagi called me earlier. Apparently excited that our idol friend is going to be back in Japan.”</p>
<p>“Minako-chan is back?”</p>
<p>“Hai. Or, she said she would call once she arrives. Wouldn’t it be nice to be reunited once again?”</p>
<p>“Ah. Well, all except one.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, has Rei contacted anyone lately?”</p>
<p>“No.  You know how she is about technology. She doesn’t even carry a cell  phone anymore. Besides, I doubt there will be any reception in those  mountains.”</p>
<p>“I know. She hasn’t written in months, despite  Usagi’s desperate attempt to reach out to her. I mean, at least Minako  is able to call us once in a while, but Rei is another story.”</p>
<p>“Hai. You know how she is.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Well, I’m babbling again. Anyway, are you free tonight?”</p>
<p>“I have nothing planned tonight, is something going on?”</p>
<p>“Minako said she would call Usagi and we would meet at her penthouse. Is that alright with you?”</p>
<p>“No  problem, I wouldn’t mind seeing you guys again. It’s been a while,  especially with how the hospital has been engulfing much of my time.  Call me when you’re heading there?”</p>
<p>“Hai.”</p>
<p>“Ja ne.” Ami  closed her phone and leaned against the window. Minako was going to be  back in town. The senshi would be reunited once again, but they were  missing one more. It saddened Ami knowing that Rei was the least they  heard from. When the miko first left for Kyoto, there was an excitement  within her. It was only after Usagi’s wedding that she slowly stopped  writing, in fact just stopped contacting any of them. Letters went  unanswered despite who wrote. <em>Rei, what have you been doing? How have you been doing? Did things with Minako end up </em>that<em> badly?<br />
</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Minako  found herself standing at the foot of the staircase. She stood there  simply looking up at the flight of stares she was about to endure. The  idol looked at her phone and wondered whether to call Usagi, but denied  the opportunity. She wanted to talk things out with Rei first, and was  still trying to cool down from what happened earlier. <em>Breathe in. Breathe out. </em>Minako  closed her eyes and let out a deep breath that seemed to let her loosen  up. Finally making her way into the Hikawa Shrine, she caught sight of  someone wearing a very familiar miko outfit. Her heart leaped, but then  sunk once again when she realized that it was not her friend.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” she called.</p>
<p>The young miko stopped in her steps and then replied, “The shrine is closed for today, but you can come back tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no I’m actually here to see Hino Rei.”</p>
<p>“Hino-sensei?”</p>
<p>“Yes I’m a very good friend of hers.”</p>
<p>“Ah, well then, right this way.” The miko led Minako into the building and was seated, “One moment while I get her.”</p>
<p>Minako nodded in agreement as she began to look at her surroundings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile  Rei was starting to unpack her belongings, placing them on the familiar  shelves, when she accidentally knocked down one of the boxes that was  safely placed on the second shelf. The contents of it scattered on the  floor, and the miko looked at it in surprise. It was none other than  Minako’s albums. She had only two, one when they had the little game  show fiasco, and the other was when…Rei shook her head in an attempt to  forget those memories when someone knocked on her door.</p>
<p>“Hino-sensei?”</p>
<p>“Yes  Rikka. Come in,” replied Rei as she gracefully hid the two albums  underneath her clothes. The younger miko walked in nervously, and shut  the door behind her.</p>
<p>“You have a guest. She claims to be friend of yours.”</p>
<p>“I  never informed any of my friends of my return, now how could they have  possibly-” Rei’s eyes widened when she realized that it was probably  Minako who was waiting outside.</p>
<p>“Rikka. Was she wearing a baseball cap?”</p>
<p>“Hai, I couldn’t really see her face though.”</p>
<p>Rei  sighed. Either way she was going to have to face Minako. At least at  this point it was in the privacy of her home, and away from the  paparazzi. Feeling defeated from her attempt to avoid the idol  completely, she motioned for Rikka to let her in. The young miko bowed  and headed outside. Within a few seconds, Minako was standing inside  her room. Rei dismissed Rikka, and the young miko hastily left the room.</p>
<p>“Funny how she didn’t recognized you with that silly hat,” said Rei calmly.</p>
<p>“Why did you just leave like that?”</p>
<p>“I have my reasons Minako and I’m not in the liberty to discuss them.”</p>
<p>“There you go again. Rei, I haven’t seen you in nearly two years, and that is how you greet me? What happened to us?”</p>
<p>“Life. That’s what happened. We grew up.”</p>
<p>“More  like grew apart. You know, I was angry when you pulled that stunt at  the airport. So furious that I insisted on coming here, but more over I  was hurt. It hurt seeing that act. We’re friends after all Rei. ”</p>
<p><em>That’s right,</em> thought Rei sadly,<em> just friends. </em>The  miko was silent, and tried her best not to look at Minako. There was a  deafening silence between the two girls and it made them feel even more  awkward around each other.</p>
<p>“You know. Everyone misses you, I  doubt you’ve called them yet,” said Minako finally, “We’re supposed to  meet in my place tonight. It would be nice if you could make it.”</p>
<p>Rei finally turned to the idol, with an expressionless face. She nodded, “That would be nice.” Her voice held no emotion to it.</p>
<p>“Rei.  I don’t know what’s going on with you right now, but we’ve missed you.  I’ve missed you. You were always there for me whenever I needed someone  to understand me. You were, no you <em>are</em> my best friend. I really  hate arguing with you. So for tonight, let’s call it a truce, for  everyone’s sake. This is a chance to be reunited with everyone again.”</p>
<p>Rei nodded, feeling a pang of guilt overcome her emotions. She was just grateful that she and Minako did not yell at each other.</p>
<hr />
<p>Usagi  was pacing back and forth in her living room, frequently glancing at  the clock. Makoto came over to her house along with Ami, and they were  both settled in the couch eyeing their friend.</p>
<p>“Where’s Mamoru?”</p>
<p>“He’s on a business trip and won’t be back in few days.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you called us?”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it. I get scared being alone here sometimes!” Her phone finally rang and she quickly picked it up.</p>
<p>“Mushi  mushi! Minako-chan! Hai, Mako-chan and Ami-chan are already here. Okay  we’re on our way. EH? REI-CHAN IS WITH YOU!! Ah, gomen. I got excited  for a moment. When did she return? Today?! And she didn’t even call any  of us? Hai, we’ll be there in a few minutes. Ja ne.”</p>
<p>Makoto and Ami were now staring at their odango-haired friend. “So Rei is back too. Wow, this will definitely be interesting.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that Mako-chan?” asked Usagi, now alertly interested.</p>
<p>“Well, she hasn’t contacted any of us for months, and now she suddenly appears out of nowhere without even calling any of us.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” replied Ami, “but I’m sure she has a good reason.”</p>
<p>“I got it!” exclaimed Usagi as her friends looked up at her, “ maybe Rei-chan is in love with Minako!”</p>
<p>Makoto  and Ami nearly fell off the couch when they heard the odango haired  girl’s revelation. “Usagi, don’t tell me… you only figured that out  now?! Sometimes you can be really oblivious to things.”</p>
<p>“What? Why? Did I miss something?”</p>
<p>“Well, it did take her a while in the past to even realize that Minako was Sailor Venus.”</p>
<p>“Never  mind, we should start heading there.” Makoto grabbed her keys and began  to walk towards the exit of the house. Ami followed quietly while Usagi  was still trying to figure out what Makoto meant. <em>I thought I had it all figured out, </em>she thought.</p>
