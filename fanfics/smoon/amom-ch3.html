<h1>A Meeting of Minds (part 3 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/softrogue.html">SoftRogue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/amom-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>---Present Time---

It truly didn&#39;t surprise me that we somehow ended up at the Crown 
Arcade. Since there was no current threat to Crystal Tokyo or to 
humanity, the meeting at the Hikawa Shrine was just an informal get 
together between the Inners and us. We spent several hours there 
catching up with each other and tasting Makotos wonderful cooking. 
(Although, truth be told, I spent most of the time keeping a tight 
reign on Haruka and her...enthusiasm).

Although Haruka might protest about these meetings (somewhat loudly, I 
might add), I know that she enjoys them; and not because of her little 
&#39;theories&#39;. It might have taken the two of us a while to realize it, 
but Usagi and the others are more than just our fellow Senshi and 
friends; they are our family.

It wasn&#39;t a surprise when Usagi suggested that we all go out for ice 
cream. After a token protest from Rei, we all headed out to what is 
practically the Inners second home (the first obviously being the 
Hikawa Shrine). Arriving at the Arcade, we took up several tables and I 
was again treated to the sight of my future Queen eating her sundae 
with a childlike relish. I was also once again treated to Rei&#39;s 
admonishments of Usagi&#39;s eating habits.

I was also busy keeping a close eye on my daughter as she picked at the 
cup of ice cream she ordered for herself. I am still concerned about 
her eating habits, even though she has shown a marked improvement over 
how she use to eat after we adopted her. There has also been a definite 
improvement in her physical wellbeing these past two years; but old 
habits die hard and there have been times that I&#39;ve felt frustrated at 
how little she would eat.

It wasn&#39;t long until the others finished their ice cream and went into 
the Arcade proper. I smiled at the sight of Minako taking Hotaru under 
her wing, as it were, and showing her the intricacies of the latest 
Sailor V game. Usagi was loudly protesting Rei&#39;s enthusiasm in playing 
one of the Arcades newest additions: Whack-a-Rabbit. Ami, meanwhile, 
had setup her laptop in a nearby booth and was working on refining her 
program while Makoto sat next to her.

Looking over at Haruka, I couldn&#39;t help but roll my eyes as she watched 
Ami and Makoto with a silly grin on her face. I shook my head when she 
met my eyes and mouthed &#39;I told you so.&#39;

Far be it from me to ruin my lovers&#39; fun, but I felt it was finally 
time to dissuade her of one of her favorite &#39;theories&#39;. &quot;Watch.&quot; is 
said softly as I turned my attention back to the booth.

It didn&#39;t take long until what I expected to happen occurred. While Ami 
was diligently working away on her laptop, Makoto leaned up against the 
shorter girl to apparently get a closer look at the screen. Haruka 
reached over and grasped one of my hands, giving it a squeeze in 
satisfaction. Not taking my eyes off the two younger girls, I raise my 
free hand and extend a finger for her to signal her to wait. It didn&#39;t 
take long for what I was waiting for to happen.

After watching for a few moments, we saw Ami shift slightly in her 
seat. It wasn&#39;t much and, if you weren&#39;t looking for it, you would have 
missed it completely. While she didn&#39;t move very far, the position she 
was in now left Makoto in an awkward position. It didn&#39;t take long for 
the brunette to move into a more comfortable position, one that brought 
her closer to the blue haired girl. A few moments later, Ami once again 
shifted away from the taller girl.

&quot;Wha...&quot; Haruka muttered, understanding finally dawning.

&quot;I told you so.&quot; I say with a small smile, unable to resist needling my 
love.

&quot;But...but I...I was so sure...&quot;

&quot;You were sure about what?&quot; Minako asked as she suddenly sat across 
from us, sipping on a soda.

I look around to find Hotaru, only to see her now playing the Sailor V 
game with Usagi. And apparently winning.

Unfortunately, the slight distraction provided ample time for Haruka to 
say what was on her mind. &quot;I thought that Ami-chan and Mako-chan were 
an item, you know?&quot;

&#39;I love Haruka. I love her very much. I don&#39;t want to hit her. No, I 
definitely don&#39;t want to hit her...or make her sleep on the couch.&#39; I 
think to myself repeatedly.

&quot;Oh, that.&quot; Minako says, surprising me. &quot;Well, I know that Mako-chan is 
interested in Ami but she hasn&#39;t come out and said anything yet.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Haruka said, &quot;And how would you know anything about that?&quot; she 
asks suggestively.

I resist the urge to groan. It&#39;s been difficult enough to keep Haruka 
from making comments to the Inners about their love lives, or apparent 
lack there of. I know she means well, but she tends to get caught up 
and carried away with her little &#39;theories&#39;.

&quot;Ah, you&#39;re forgetting that you&#39;re speaking to one and only Goddess of 
Love!&quot; Minako says with enthusiasm. &quot;Besides, I&#39;ve been watching the 
two of them for several years now.&quot;

&quot;Really...&quot; Haruka says slowly. &quot;So, Makoto&#39;s got feelings for Ami, but 
Ami isn&#39;t interested?&quot;

&quot;Exactly.&quot; Minako agrees, taking another sip of he soda.

&quot;So...who&#39;s the lucky girl that Ami has her eye on?&quot;

&quot;Haruka...&quot; I groan, only to be ignored.

&quot;Don&#39;t know.&quot; Minako shrugs. &quot;It&#39;s hard to get any reading from her. 
I&#39;m pretty sure that she&#39;s not interested in boys, but I&#39;ve never seen 
her checking out any girls. I really don&#39;t know what type of person she 
likes.&quot;

Haruka sits there in thought for a moment, before giving the other 
blonde a lecherous grin. &quot;So Miss &#39;Goddess of Love&#39;...why don&#39;t you 
tell me what&#39;s really going on between Rei and Usagi?&quot;

I sigh in defeat and excuse myself from the table, not that they notice 
as they begin to whisper surreptitiously to each other. Making my way 
over the booth that Ami and Makoto were sitting at, I join them and 
spend the next hour or so talking to Ami about the program she was 
working. If I hadn&#39;t been looking for it, I would have missed the look 
of relief that the blue haired girl gave me. While I wasn&#39;t very 
proficient with computer programming, I knew enough to have a general 
idea about what she was talking about.

After a while, Usagi and the others finished getting their fix of video 
games (either that or they ran out of money). We then walked back to 
the Shrine, cutting through the park behind it, while I listened to 
Usagi talking excitedly.

&quot;Wow! You were great, Hotaru-chan! I bet you could easly beat the high 
score on Sailor V!&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Usagi-san.&quot; my daughter said shyly.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so!&quot; Minako protested, &quot;There isn&#39;t anyway that anyone 
is going to beat MY score!&quot;

&quot;Oh, pooh!&quot; Usagi said. &quot;You&#39;re just upset that she beat you twice in a 
row.&quot;

&quot;She did not! I was just taking it easy on her...like I always take it 
easy on you.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!? How could you, Mina-chan!&quot; Usagi whined.

&quot;Ah, geeze Odango Atama! Why don&#39;t you grow up? It&#39;s just a game.&quot; Rei 
said with exasperation.

&quot;Whaaa! Rei&#39;s being mean to me again!&quot;

&quot;You just had to say something, didn&#39;t you Rei?&quot; Makoto asked with 
annoyance.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have to if she would just act her age.&quot; the shrine maiden 
protested.

&quot;Why would I want to? I wouldn&#39;t want to get wrinkles like you.&quot; Usagi 
said, giving Rei the red-eye.

Rei growled and lunged at the blonde, who showed remarkable dexterity 
by dancing out of her reach.

&quot;Ah, give it a rest, Rei!&quot; Usagi said with a wide smile. &quot;It&#39;s a 
wonderful day! Where here with our friends having a great time! 
Absolutely nothing could go wrong! So why don&#39;t you just chill out!&quot;

Rei paused and was about to respond, but something interrupted her.

&quot;wwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!&quot;

*BAMN!*

We all tensed up and I pulled out my Henshin wand as something fell 
onto Usagi, driving her face first into the ground. My first impression 
was the abundance of pink. A lot of pink. Pink dress, pink hair, and 
even pink panties.

&quot;Owie...&quot; the pink...thing on top of Usagi said.

&quot;Chibi-Usa!&quot; Hotaru said with excitement, launching herself forward and 
embracing her friend in a tight hug.

&quot;Hotaru-chan!&quot; the future princess replied, returning the hug with 
enthusiasm.

It took me a moment to recognize her. While it&#39;s been only six months 
since we had last seen her, it&#39;s apparently been quite a bit longer for 
Chibi-Usa. The last time we saw her, she was about 11 years old, but 
she looked closer to 14 now.

&quot;...uh...can both of you please get off of me?&quot; Usagi moaned from 
underneath the two younger girls.

***********

I look up from my drawing table, the dress I&#39;m designing no longer 
taking up my attention. I look inward as I reach out with my powers to 
identify the source of the disturbance in the Time Stream I just felt. 
It takes just a moment for me to recognize the unique temporal 
signature of the Time Key.

&quot;Small Lady.&quot; I smile, knowing that she is the only one who is able to 
use it besides Usagi or myself.

Fortunately for me, when someone travels through time using that 
particular artifact the effects on the space/time continuum is minimal. 
With minimal effort, I observe the flow of the Time Stream and I can 
see that there is no consequence to her travel through the flow of 
time.

I sigh in relief. Since the Time Key is an extension of the Gates of 
Time itself, it&#39;s designed to facilitate ones travel through the Time 
Stream.

&quot;Unlike some things.&quot; I mutter to myself.

---Silver Millennium---

&quot;Damn it!&quot; I mutter to myself as I walk through the halls of the Lunar 
Palace.

&quot;Two months! Eight weeks! 56 days! 1344 hours spent cleaning up 
that...that disaster!&quot;

Stopping in the middle of the deserted hall I slump my shoulders. 
Taking a deep breath, I raise my fist up and say, &quot;Damn you! Next time 
I see you, you&#39;ll get what&#39;s coming to you! You and your K-9 unit too!&quot;

I pause and realize I&#39;m making a spectacle of myself. Running a hand 
across my face, I feel a bone weary exhaustion begin to take a hold of 
me. I know I should just use my powers to return to Charon Castle or 
even my personal quarters here at the Lunar Palace and sleep for the 
next day or three. But I can&#39;t. Not without seeing my Pai first.

It still amazes me how, in the past two years, young Pai has become 
such an important part of my life. Ever since the day I first met her, 
I&#39;ve found that I enjoy the weekly sessions we have. Since I can&#39;t 
spend a lot of time with her, I&#39;ve made it a point to visit her at 
least one day a week. Normally, we would spend the first part of the 
day reviewing whatever we talked about the last time we met, followed 
by a variety of discussions ranging from Literature to Physics to 
Chemistry to Politics. Finally, I would assign a topic for her to write 
a report on.

To this day, it still amazes me the breadth of knowledge young Pai has 
and her hunger to learn more. As it is, I can barely stay ahead of my 
six year old charge.

But, thanks to that meddling Time Lord, I&#39;ve had to spend the past two 
months repairing damage to the Time Stream he caused. The only thing 
that kept me from using the Time Gates to locate him and shoving the 
Time Staff so far up his ass he would cough up the Garnet Orb was the 
fact he did more good than harm.

&quot;Where is she?&quot; I wonder out loud.

I&#39;m starting to get frustrated and irritable as I search the Lunar 
Palace. I&#39;ve been searching for a while now, trying to find where young 
Pai might be. I had already checked her personal quarters and the Royal 
Library, yet I haven&#39;t been able to find her yet. Figuring that there 
could be only one other place she might be I make my way down to an 
unused portion of the Palace.

Finally making my way to my destination, I carefully (very carefully) 
open the heavy, steel reinforced door and enter the Lab.

&quot;Hello Airi.&quot; I say without preamble.

&quot;Gagh!&quot; the Senshi of Mercury exclaims as she juggles vial of fluid in 
her hands. &quot;Don&#39;t DO that!&quot;

I stand there, giving the blonde Senshi a look of mild reproach. It 
takes her a few moments to collect herself before she recognizes me. 
&quot;Oh, hello Lady Iria. What can I do for you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking for Pai.&quot;

She looks at me with large blue eyes before blinking several times. 
&quot;Who?&quot;

I resist rolling my eyes. While no one could deny fact that Airi was 
highly intelligent, she was also fairly scatter brained. That was the 
main reason she wasn&#39;t given the task of seeing to young Pai&#39;s 
education like I was.

&quot;Pai. Your successor?&quot;

I could practically see the gears turning in her head before she 
finally said, &quot;Oh, Pai! Why didn&#39;t you say so in the first place? She 
should be in the Opal Room with the Princess.&quot;

I nod politely and exit the Lab. &#39;Why would they be in the Opal Room?&#39; 
I think to myself, absently aware of an explosion rocking the Lab 
behind me. &#39;Nobody&#39;s used it for several decades now.&#39;

After several minutes, I make my way to the Opal Room and enter. To my 
utter surprise, I see that the Opal Room had been redecorated into what 
looks like a pre-school room. Looking around, I notice the assorted 
toys that one would fine in such a place. Entering the room, I see Pai 
sitting at a low table drawing with what looked like a crayon, a look 
of utter boredom on her face.

&quot;Hello, child.&quot; I say softly.

Pai looks up and her face immediately brightened. &quot;Sensei!&quot; she 
exclaimed.

She stands from her chair and rushes over to me, almost as if she would 
throw her arms around me and hug me. She stops short, however, and 
stands in front of me demurely.

&quot;Hello, Sensei.&quot; she says softly.

&quot;Pai.&quot; I say warmly. &quot;How have you been?&quot;

&quot;Ok...I guess.&quot; Pai says, her eyes downcast, her voice thick with 
distress.

Frowning, I look closely at my charge then glance over at the table she 
was working at. I can tell that she was drawing what appeared to be a 
fractal spiral, which surprised me since we already covered fractals 
over a year ago. Looking around the room, I realize how...childish 
everything seems. From the scattered toys to the d&eacute;cor, everything 
looked like it was for a young child; which confused me since Pai never 
showed any interest in such thing.

Kneeling down, I lift young Pais&#39; chin until I&#39;m looking her in the 
eyes. &quot;Child? What is going on here?&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; a voice says from behind me.

Turning my head, I see a primly dressed older woman leading Princess 
Serenity into the room. &quot;Who are you?&quot; I ask slowly, doing my best to 
hide my confusion at what&#39;s going on.

&quot;I am Dame Miho, the Duchess of Matins.&quot; she says properly, &quot;And I have 
been charged by the Queen herself to see the care of Princess Serenity 
and that child.&quot;

&quot;I...see.&quot; I say slowly, already feeling my ire rise at how she&#39;s 
acting, not only towards me, but also towards young Pai.

&quot;And it&#39;s a good thing too.&quot; Dame Miho continues as if she didn&#39;t even 
hear me. &quot;It&#39;s totally improper for such a young girl-child to be 
reading about such inconsequential things as &#39;quantal physicals&#39; or 
whatever. A proper lady shouldn&#39;t be bother with such things.&quot;

I stand slowly, doing my best to contain my anger. &quot;Pai?&quot; I say softly.

&quot;Hai, Sensei?&quot;

&quot;I want you to take the princess to your quarters. I wish to...speak 
with Dame Miho.&quot;

&quot;Hai, Sensei.&quot; young Pai replies, before quickly moving over to the 
three year old princess. &quot;Come on, Serenity. I have some cookies in my 
room.&quot;

&quot;Wai! Cookies!&quot; the future princess says with excitement before 
grabbing young Pai&#39;s hand and dragging her out of the room.

&quot;Excuse me? What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Dame Miho protested.

&quot;Excuse me?! What do YOU think YOU&#39;RE doing?!&quot; I snapped back.

I have to admit, privately, that I was slightly impressed. Most people 
would have flinched at my tone, however Dame Miho stood firm before me. 
Not that that lasted for long. Twenty minutes later, the Duchess of 
Matins fled from the Opal Room in tears.

I left the Opal Room feeling...satisfied. I know I shouldn&#39;t have said 
some of the things I did, but it felt so...good. I make my way to young 
Pai&#39;s room briskly. Arriving there, I enter her quarters and find her 
waiting at a table in her small sitting room reading a book.

&quot;Sensei!&quot; young Pai greeted me excitedly, rising from her chair and 
offering it to me.

I gratefully accept her offer and, a few moments later, she&#39;s handing 
me a cup of tea. Relaxing in the chair, I take a sip of the blend and 
voice my approval. The two of us then sit in silence for a few moments, 
savoring the comfortable atmosphere.

&quot;I...I was worried...&quot; young Pai said softly, finally breaking the 
silence between us.

&quot;About what?&quot; I inquired.

Shyly, young Pai softly said &quot;You...you were gone for so long. And I 
didn&#39;t hear anything from you...&quot;

&quot;I apologize.&quot; I said, interpreting her. &quot;Things became so hectic I 
wasn&#39;t able to break away.&quot;

She nodded in understanding and I relaxed further. We sat there in 
silence for a while longer. Finally, I asked, &quot;Where is the princess?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s taking a nap in my bed...after finishing an entire plate of 
cookies I was saving for you.&quot; young Pai said with a trace embarrassed.

&quot;Like mother, like daughter.&quot; I chuckled softly. Looking at young Pai 
closely, I ask softly, &quot;What&#39;s been happening since I&#39;ve been gone?&quot;

Young Pai spent the next few minutes filling me in about what&#39;s been 
going on since I had last been here. She told me about the lessons that 
Airi had been giving her about her future duties as the Senshi of 
Mercury...when she remembered to, that is. I also learned that 
apparently a new Senshi of Uranus and a new Senshi of Neptune had been 
Awakened during my absents. Kei, the new Uranus, was 10 years old; 
while Yuri, the new Neptune, was a year younger. Both had Awakened 
normally and were both currently in the care of the their respective 
elders. However, she avoided the one subject I was interested in.

&quot;And what about Dame Miho?&quot;

Looking down at the floor, young Pai slowly began to speak. &quot;About a 
week after you left, the Queen brought her in to help raise her 
daughter. When she learned about me, Dame Miho insisted that I were 
also put into her care. Since you were missing and the Queen and Lady 
Airi were both busy, no one was around to say no to her.&quot;

&quot;Did...did you enjoy her watching over you?&quot; I asked carefully, 
suddenly feeling guilty about my &#39;talk&#39; with Dame Miho.

She seriously considered her answer for a moment. &quot;Not...not really, 
no. I mean, I know I&#39;ve missed out on what normal girls my age do, 
but...&quot; young Pai trailed off for a moment before continuing. &quot;She, 
Dame Miho that is, didn&#39;t let me do any of my normal readings. She 
restricted my access on the computer and convinced Luna to limit my 
time at the library.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; I replied, suddenly no longer feeling guilty about the 
dressing down I had given the Duchess...and I also had a sudden strong 
urge to drop kick the Mau advisor across a courtyard or two.

&quot;By the way, Sensei. Here.&quot; young Pai said, handing me several data 
strips. &quot;I&#39;m sorry that my reports aren&#39;t as thorough as I would like, 
but I did the best I could with what I had available.&quot;

I couldn&#39;t help but smile, knowing full well that whatever she had 
written about would be more in depth than most people would be able to 
do with twice the resources young Pai would have normally had 
available.

We chatted for a while longer before I finally had to beg off for the 
day. The events of the past two months had caught up with me and, after 
several yawns, I excused myself; but only after promising to spend the 
rest of the tomorrow going over the reports she had written for me with 
her.

Stepping out of young Pai&#39;s quarters, I yawned again before I turned to 
head towards my own rooms, only to literally run into the one person I 
really didn&#39;t want to deal with.

&quot;Hello...Iria.&quot;

&quot;Nanami.&quot; I said dryly.

The Senshi of Jupiter and I shared a long look before she finally said, 
&quot;Serenity wants to talk to you. Now. Follow me.&quot;

With that, Nanami turned around and walked down the hall, not even 
pausing to see if I was following her.

&#39;Oh. Crap.&#39; I think to myself. It could mean only one thing if Queen 
Serenity had asked HER to come back to the Lunar Palace to deal with 
ME. I must have stepped in it big time.

---Present Time---

I shake my head ruefully as I remember what had happened next. Looking 
back, I knew that it wasn&#39;t one of my greatest moments. It had been the 
first time that the two of us had ever really fought before and, 
unfortunately, it hadn&#39;t been as two old friends either. It had been a 
fight between the Queen and the Senshi of Pluto.

Finally, the two of us had come to a concusses. I had agreed that I had 
overstepped my bounds with how I had dealt with Dame Miho and Serenity 
and conceded that she had been wrong to allow the Duchess to effect 
young Pai&#39;s education to such an extent.

&quot;I&#39;m doing it again!&quot; I sighed in frustration, realizing that I had 
allowed myself to think about what had been between Pai and myself.

Fortunately, before I could dwell on the past further, I heard the 
sound of Haruka&#39;s car pulling into the driveway.

Author&#39;s Notes...
Well, I hoped you enjoyed the third chapter of this shoujo-ai fic. I 
have a lot planned for it, so it might take a long time to get 
everything I want written up, so please beer with me.

Personally, I don&#39;t think this came out as well as it could have. So, 
please, if you have any suggestions let me know.

Any C&amp;C would be appreciated.
