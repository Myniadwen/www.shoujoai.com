<h1>Other Disguises (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/otherdis-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Hotaru Tomoe lay there on top of the bed, the lamps scattered around the 
room providing a soft glow. Her black hair fell into those mournful 
violet eyes, studying the lamps set nearest to her. She reached out to 
touch one, then drew her hand back with a sigh.

&#39;Chibi-Usa gave me that one,&#39; Hotaru thought bleakly. Her hand shook as 
she clenched it, fighting back the urge to lash out uncontrollably. 
&#39;No,&#39; she got up, striding across the room in her black skirt and 
blouse, &#39;it was given out of kindness, no matter what happened 
afterward.&#39;

&quot;Wonder when Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama will get home?&quot; Hotaru 
wondered aloud. Both had left this morning, explaining that they were 
going to be gone for most of the day. It was odd, Hotaru frowned, 
considering that they and Setsuna-mama had been hanging around her a lot 
recently. She flushed as she thought, &#39;I hope they haven&#39;t been too 
worried.&#39;

Bing-Bong!

Hotaru got up, feeling oddly grateful for the interruption. She made her 
way to the front door and swung it open, &quot;Yes, how can I help... 
Minako?&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Minako said with a smile, the older blonde beauty looking down at 
her with a fond expression on her face.

&quot;The others are all out for the day,&quot; Hotaru explained to her 
apologetically, &quot;I can let them know you came by....&quot;

Minako shook her head, &quot;Not necessary.&quot; She strode right by the startled 
Hotaru then turned to look at her, &quot;I came over to see you.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Hotaru blinked.

Minako tilted her head to the side, &quot;I need your help with something.&quot;

Hotaru frowned, a suspicion rising within her. &quot;This isn&#39;t some attempt 
to keep my mind off of...&quot; she trailed off, unable to say Chibi-Usa&#39;s 
name.

&quot;Of course it is,&quot; Minako said cheerfully, &quot;are you going to stand there 
in the doorway all day or are you coming in with me?&quot;

&quot;You admit it?&quot; Hotaru blinked as she swung the door shut with a click 
and followed Minako into the living room.

Minako gave her a smile, her face lighting up with amusement. &quot;You think 
I&#39;m going to lie to you about it?&quot; she chuckled.

Hotaru felt her lips twitch involuntarily, almost smiling back. They sat 
down on the couch together, &quot;So what is the distraction?&quot;

Minako sat with a smooth grace, her long legs crossed elegantly. &quot;I have 
a little problem I need your help with,&quot; she said.

&quot;A Senshi problem?&quot; Hotaru asked seriously, her violet eyes narrowed 
slightly.

&quot;Nothing so dramatic,&quot; Minako laughed, her blue eyes twinkling slightly. 
She leaned forward, &quot;You see, I&#39;m sort of in a grind.&quot;

&quot;Bind,&quot; Artemis popped out from her bag to correct her.

&quot;Whatever,&quot; Minako shrugged. She looked back at Hotaru, &quot;You see, I 
promised to help one of the school clubs with a special event and I kind 
of need your help.&quot;

&quot;Wait till she tells you which club,&quot; Artemis grumbled, the little white 
cat shaking his head.

Minako gave him a dirty look then smiled at Hotaru, &quot;The cosplay club.&quot;

&quot;Cosplay?&quot; Hotaru repeated then shook her head, &quot;oh no!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve gotten the others to agree,&quot; Minako continued on relentlessly, 
&quot;but there&#39;s a role we need a player for, one that would be perfect for 
you.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Hotaru said firmly, wondering at the eager glow in Minako&#39;s eyes. 
&#39;I don&#39;t think I like that look,&#39; she thought worriedly.

&quot;I&#39;m only going to try on the outfits with the others,&quot; Hotaru said the 
next day as she and Minako walked over to the cosplay club together, 
&quot;I&#39;m not going to be part of the performance.&quot; Minako had picked her up 
from home and Hotaru had changed out of her uniform into one of her many 
dark colored dresses, this one a purple so deep it was almost black.

&quot;Hai, hai,&quot; Minako nodded, that smile still on her face. The still 
school uniform clad girl looked over at Hotaru and noted, &quot;You&#39;re cute 
when you&#39;re stubborn.&quot;

Hotaru nearly tripped she was so surprised, a sudden blush coloring her 
usually pale cheeks. &quot;Minako,&quot; she protested.

The blonde tossed Hotaru a gently amused look. &quot;Hasn&#39;t anyone told you 
that before?&quot; Minako asked her curiously.

&quot;No they haven&#39;t,&quot; Hotaru said shortly.

&quot;Their loss,&quot; Minako shrugged as she tapped on the door to the cosplay 
club.

The door swung open and Makoto smiled wryly, the tall girl dressed in a 
almost blood red jacket over a stylized military uniform. &quot;Who am I 
supposed to be again?&quot; she asked, tugging at the cross she wore around 
her neck.

&quot;Misato,&quot; Minako volunteered the name as she looked Makoto over 
thoughtfully, &quot;and it looks like you&#39;ll fit the part perfectly.&quot;

&quot;Minako,&quot; Usagi wailed, the white labcoat she wore swirling around the 
slim blonde&#39;s body, &quot;why do I have to hide my hair under the coat?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to be playing Ritsuko,&quot; Minako explained to her patiently, 
&quot;and she has short blonde hair. Hiding yours is better than cutting it, 
I think.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t dare,&quot; Usagi grabbed at her hair protectively. &quot;Couldn&#39;t 
we just use the disguise pen?&quot; Usagi offered hopefully.

Ami frowned as she adjusted the military uniform that she wore, &quot;We&#39;ll 
be appearing alongside average students, it wouldn&#39;t be fair.&quot; She took 
a look into a mirror, &quot;You know, except for the hair color I do look 
like Maya.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got everyone involved?&quot; Hotaru blinked, looking around the room.

&quot;Just we high-school students,&quot; Rei said wryly. Her log black hair was 
pulled back in a severe style, the black uniform intentionally loose on 
her body. The glasses she wore glinted as she pushed them up with a 
white gloved hand, &quot;Do I make a good Gendo?&quot;

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Minako nodded then she flashed a grin, &quot;I bet many of the 
young ladies won&#39;t even realize you&#39;re actually a girl.&quot;

There was an odd moment as Usagi looked over at Rei, the strangest 
expression on her pretty face. She looked away, a blush coloring her 
cheeks. &quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Usagi agreed softly, &quot;you look really good 
dressed like that, Rei.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Rei blushed faintly.

&quot;I was going to ask Mamoru to be Gendo,&quot; Minako murmured to Hotaru 
softly, &quot;but the rules say he can&#39;t, so....&quot; She shrugged and gently 
grabbed Hotaru by the hand, tugging her forward as she said, &quot;Let&#39;s go 
try on out outfits.&quot;

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Hotaru stumbled after her.

Instead of a change room part of the room was simply blocked off, the 
costumes hanging on racks ready to be worn. Minako pulled two outfits 
out, one white and the other red then passed the white one to Hotaru, 
&quot;Here you go.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Hotaru blushed as she set it aside then began to strip. Her 
dress was easily pulled over her head then she slipped her shoes off one 
at time.

&quot;You&#39;ll need to take your bra off as well,&quot; Minako said with a gentle 
smile. Her shirt and bra were already off, the beautiful blonde standing 
there casually unclothed.

Hotaru nodded with a gulp, turning away as quickly as she could. Her 
heart was beating a bit faster as she slipped her bra off, a vivid flush 
coloring her cheeks. &#39;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39; she thought, grabbing the 
stretchy white top and pulling it on.

&quot;Aren&#39;t these a bit... revealing?&quot; Hotaru asked weakly a few minutes 
later.

Minako pushed her blonde hair back in a oddly studied gesture, her 
breasts bouncing slightly in their skin tight confinement. The costume 
she wore looked like it had been painted on every one of Minako&#39;s 
curves, almost more sinful than being naked.

&quot;They cover everything,&quot; Minako offered cheerfully.

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Hotaru looked down at her own body sheathed in tight white 
cloth. &quot;I hope Haruka and the others don&#39;t see me like this,&quot; she 
muttered. She looked up only to see Minako looking at her oddly, the 
faintest of blushes on her own face.

&quot;How do the costumes look,&quot; Rei called from the other side of the 
divider, breaking whatever was passing between them.

&quot;We&#39;ll be right out,&quot; Minako answered, quickly regaining her composure.

&#39;What was that about?&#39; Hotaru wondered.</pre>
