<pre>&quot;So, What will we be doing for vacation?&quot; Makoto asked, with a
yawn as she, Ami, and Minako walked down on of the sidewalks of
Juuban. Minako cast a glance over to the brunette.

&quot;... There are many things we can do here in Juuban,&quot; Ami smiled,
&quot;Like going to the library and reading a good book.&quot; Makoto blinked,
and gulped. A sweatdrop rolled off her forehead, and she laughed
slightly.

&quot;Yeah well... Um, We could do that... Sometime during vacation...&quot;
she said. Minako suppressed a giggle.

&quot;Well, I guess we could just stay here in Juuban like the outers... I
mean, Just because Rei and Usagi went to Kyoto doesn&#39;t mean we
have to go anywhere... Right?&quot; the blonde asked. Makoto looked
back at Ami, then at Minako.

&quot;You&#39;re right I guess...&quot; Makoto responded.

&quot;... Speaking of which,&quot; Minako smiled, &quot;I wonder what&#39;s going on
with Rei and Usagi...&quot;

Rei sat her and Usagi&#39;s bags down in the hotel room with a small
thump. They had arrived in Kyoto at about 6:00, and by the time
they had found this hotel it was around 8:00. Both were about to
collapse from walking around so much, and could use a good rest.
Rei looked around the room. The walls were a peaceful blue shade,
the curtains for the one window a light blue, and the carpet was light
blue. There were two beds, and a polished wooden dresser between
them. There was also a door at the back of the room to a bathroom,
and a clock on the wall.

The miko was cut out of her observations by Usagi. She was
standing beside Rei, and wrapped her arms tightly around her
friend&#39;s neck. &quot;Yay! We&#39;re here!&quot;

Rei gagged once, &quot;You&#39;re... choking... me...&quot; she managed. Usagi
just smiled, and held tighter. &#39;I knew I could make Rei let me come!&#39;

&quot;Thanks for letting me come with you, Rei-chan!&quot; Usagi cried,
happily. Rei sighed, as she tried to pry Usagi&#39;s arms from around her
neck. &#39;There is no way I&#39;m going to choke to death because my
friend decided to hug me!&#39; Rei thought, as she inched away from
Usagi. She rubbed her neck a couple times, and straightened it out.

&quot;As if I had much of a choice...&quot; muttered the miko. Rei sombered
over and sat down on the bed closest to the door, obviously leaving
the other one for her odango-haired friend. The beds weren&#39;t but
about five feet away from each other and the doorway was about six
feet from the first bed. Rei had sat the bags down next to her bed.
She picked up the smallest bag, and began setting its assortments
out on the dresser between the two beds.

Usagi sighed, and plopped down onto her own bed. She stretched
her arms, and yawned once. She layed back, folding her arms
behind her head, and resting her head on them. She let her eyes
flutter shut, and smiled comfortably.

&quot;Usagi, Aren&#39;t you going to put your things away?&quot; Rei asked, as
she reached for her other bag, glancing over her shoulder at the
odango-atama. She pulled out a piece of folded clothing.

&quot;I&#39;m too tired! Maybe later...&quot; Usagi whined, and rolled over onto
her left side, her back now facing Rei. Rei rolled her eyes, sighing
slightly. She layed the folded piece of clothing next to her, and
continued the process until all of her clothes were laying beside her.
She then piled them into the dresser beside her bed along with the
money she had brought for the trip, and glanced back at Usagi to
find that she was now sleeping peacefully.

&quot;How can she sleep when there&#39;re clothes for her to put away!?&quot;
Rei grumbled something else then said, &quot;Oh well. It has been a long
day.&quot; She tossed one of Usagi&#39;s bags over next to her bed, and the
other one landed on the bed. Rei yawned. She layed backwards, and
looked up at the ceiling.

&quot;I guess she would be tired... She -was- hounding me about
following me here all day...&quot; Rei muttered, and closed her eyes. She
then thought about something.

&quot;I was only going to come on vacation so that she would stay back
in Juuban! What a waste of my time! Of course, I do like her
company...&quot; Rei rolled over to look at the sleeping odango-atama
who had rolled over onto her back. Soon after, Rei fell asleep staring
at the golden-haired hime...

Two shady figures stood on top of a building, pale moonlight
shining down on the one in front revealing a slim body, looking
almost human, wearing armor of sorts with short green hair, and
reptilian-like eyes. The other stood completely in the shadows,
nothing shown but glowing red eyes.

&quot;They have arrived. Now that Sailor Moon is here, I shall have
Magas attack the other Sailor Senshi. I am counting on you to take
care of Sailors Moon and Mars. Are you ready, Yanmo?&quot; the figure
standing in the shadows asked in a husky voice, as its cape blew in
the wind.

The other bowed, looking upwards, its short hair blowing slightly,
and said in a deep male voice, &quot;Yes... I shall attack tomorrow,
Master.&quot; The apparent commander smirked secretly, and turned,
disappearing. Yanmo turned, and looked down at the city of Kyoto...</pre>
