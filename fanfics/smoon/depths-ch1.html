<h1>The Depths of her Eyes</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/psychokitten.html">PsYcHoKiTtEnSeNsHi611</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	&quot;Ah,&quot; she said softly while rubbing her shoulder with her right hand, &quot;I&#39;m 
so stiff!&quot;  She smiled softly at me.  &quot;I must have worked out too hard at 
the gym.&quot;
	&quot;I guess so.&quot;  I looked away from her eyes and back toward the TV.  I 
tried desperately, yet to no avail, not to notice how close she was sitting to 
me on my rather large couch.  How every once in awhile a wisp of hair would 
come a little too close to my nose, and the scent would make me close my 
eyes for a moment and remember dreams that I knew would never come alive.
	She cleared her throat, and my eyes darted back to hers.  &quot;Do you 
think...you could help me?&quot;
	&quot;Huh?&quot;  I asked, my mind still a little fuzzy from my own daydreams.
	&quot;Could you just help me get this knot out, right here?&quot;  She took my hand 
in hers, which caused a strange feeling to rise inside of me, and led it to 
her soft shoulder.  I let my hands tingle with the feeling of her skin 
beneath them, and then began to breathe again.
	&quot;Uh...sure.&quot;  Slowly, I began to rub her shoulder, being careful not to 
touch her neck or anywhere below where her hand had placed mine.  I could 
feel my cheeks burning, and my legs throbbing (not to mention the area that 
was in-between them).  I tried not to breathe too hard as I continued to rub 
her shoulder.
	&quot;That feels good...&quot; she said softly, and bent her head forward.  Long 
soft hair fell in front of her face as well, and I found my hand move upward to 
her neck and begin massaging the soft skin there.  I finally managed to 
reach up with my left hand and do the same.  &quot;Mmm...&quot; she moaned, and I 
swallowed hard.
	This...was this good, or was this bad?  I really couldn&#39;t tell.  All I 
could do was continue, my hands finally moving to the top of her neck, where 
soft skin meets the jawbone.  She continued to moan softly, but the tone had 
changed just a notch, but enough to make me squirm from the unbelievable 
amount of heat that pooled at the base of my belly.  She leaned her head 
back, that soft hair tumbling over my small hands and wrists, and I leaned 
forward slightly to catch it&#39;s scent.  So clean, so fresh...beautiful, just 
like she was.  I found myself staying in my rather awkward position, just so 
I could sit closer to her.
	Suddenly, I felt her hands on mine.  I panicked, worried if she had felt 
my closeness and was repelled by it.  She would throw my hands away from her 
and storm out of my house in disgust, and I would never see her beautiful 
smile ever again...
	Instead, she turned around so she was facing me, and led my hands to her 
waist.  Her eyes met mine...sinking depths into a lovely ocean...and leaned 
in toward my face.  I pulled back, out of pure surprise, and I felt her 
stop.  Her hands were still above mine, but no longer moving.
	I could feel her, or hear her, take a deep breath.  &quot;Why are you afraid?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; I swallowed hard, &quot;afraid.&quot;
	&quot;Yes you are!&quot;  She yelled, and I backed away from her a little further.  
I could see her take another deep breath, as if collecting herself.  &quot;You have 
a deep fear of intimacy.  You know it.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not afraid!&quot;  I said, as defensively as I could muster under the 
pressure of her deep eyes.
	&quot;Oh really?  Watch.&quot;  She leaned in toward my ear, and I pulled back 
slightly.  She sighed, as if from exhaustion, but didn&#39;t pull away from my 
ear.  &quot;You&#39;re afraid of me.&quot;  Her soft voice barely whispered into my ear, 
but I could catch the pain in it.
	I felt my heart squeeze in my chest.  I loved her so much...I would never 
hurt her, not matter what...but now I was, because I was afraid to admit to 
her, to myself, that this was what I wanted.  What I needed.  &quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot;  
New determination, carved from the raw passion and my heart beating rapidly 
in my chest, almost forced me to pull her the rest of the way toward me.  I 
felt her stiffen slightly, but I didn&#39;t let go, even though I wasn&#39;t quite 
sure she wanted me to hold on.  I turned her head, as gently as my shaking 
hands could muster, and kissed her soft lips.
	Heaven!  The only way to describe this...this wonderful feeling.  The soft 
pressure of her lips against mine, the tension behind it and the amazing 
release that came with it.  She fumbled around slightly and ended up 
straddling me, lowering her small hips upon my thighs.  How much I had 
wanted this, how much I had needed this...she gripped my face and parted her 
lips slightly, forcing me to do the same.  The kiss deepened, and I felt the 
need inside of me deepen as well.
	I let my hands wander her freely, knowing that I couldn&#39;t stop them if I 
tried.  I found little places that made her moan slightly when 
touched...that place just below her ear, her soft neck, the place just below 
her hip...sensitive places, her places...
	Her own hands began to wander me as well.  I felt her fumble with the 
buttons on my shirt, but I couldn&#39;t stop to help her...not when her own 
shirt needed to be undone.  I wasn&#39;t even sure what I was doing, but all I 
knew was that it felt good to touch her and she seemed to like it.  I know I 
liked the way she was touching me.  Who am I kidding?  I loved it.
	She pulled away from my mouth, gasping slightly and looking at me through 
half-closed lids.  &quot;God...&quot; she moaned, then seemed to try to collect 
herself.  &quot;I want you so much...I need you so much...please...&quot;
	I gripped her hips and pulled her so she was against me.  &quot;I want you just 
as much.&quot;
	&quot;Make love to me...&quot; swollen lips pleaded.  How could I deny the request?
	&quot;Yes...&quot; that husky voice wasn&#39;t mine, was it?  I covered her mouth with 
my own once again, and we proceeded in moving into a better position on the 
couch.  I finally ended up beneath that lovely figure and she pulled off the 
blouse she was wearing and tossed it to the side.  Her small lacy bra was 
soon tossed aside as well, and I faced the new complication with complete 
confidence.  Covering those little rosebuds with my hungry lips, I felt her 
shudder lightly, and those small hands wind into the back of my hair to pull 
me closer.  I could feel her legs widen, perhaps out of instinct, and those 
small thighs wrap around my waist.  Such exquisite pain.
	Those lovely lips could let wonderful sounds emerge from them...some I&#39;d 
never heard before!  Small &quot;oh!&#39;s&quot; were quite familiar, but not the way she 
would say them.  Her hands wandered again to the front of my shirt, 
awkwardly undoing the rest of the buttons.  I felt her hands stroke my own 
chest, feeling around my nipples and...
	&quot;Oh!&quot;  My head shot up and I felt her stiffen as well.  My eyes met hers 
again, desire almost blurring my vision.  She was still beautiful.  No 
matter what...I could be blind, but I would still know her beauty.
	She kissed me again, forcing me down beneath her.  My head rested softly 
on the cushions of the couch, and I reached up above me to pull her closer to 
my chest.  She was so warm, so soft...her bare skin would brush mine, so 
soft, as she began to pull desperately at my clothes and her own.  I could 
only watch, my hands and limbs shaking violently in the haze of passion.
	Her hands, so small and delicate, were working harder then I&#39;d ever seen 
them.  Her pulls at my pants were almost frightening in their urgency.  She 
gently lifted herself off my lap and pulled them all the way off me, 
struggling but working with quick pushes and hard pulls.  I slipped my hands 
up her long school skirt and touched her bare legs and thighs, until I 
reached the delicate fabric of her underwear.  So soft, so sweet...just like 
her.  Slowly, carefully, I pulled them off her bare legs, sliding them all 
the way down to her knees.  Awkwardly she leaned back, sitting atop my 
calves and stretching her long legs towards me.  I sat up as well, leaning 
forward so that our waists were level, and slid her silky white panties down 
her legs until they landed with a small sound on the carpeted floor.  She 
grasped at my own underwear and managed to pull them off, until I too was 
completely naked in front of her.
	Glorious smells, glorious sights...so new and intriguing and beautiful.  I 
took in as much of her as I could, treasuring the tiny details...that little 
tiny brown mole just beneath her right breast, that tiny birthmark just 
beneath her belly button...the way her waist curved in so slightly and then 
curved outward to her hips.  Her tan lines revealed whiter flesh around her 
breasts and on her broad shoulders, then down again to her hips and down 
towards her...
	A deep intake of breath made me look up at her, but I realized I was the 
one who had made the sound.  I could feel the tension in her calves and legs 
that were wrapped around my waist now - somehow we had managed to drift 
extremely close to each other - and I felt it in myself.  I reached toward 
her, to caress that soft skin, but only managed to touch her cheek.  She 
closed her eyes and kissed my hand, so soft, so sweet...I wanted to say 
something to her, to let her know...to tell her everything I&#39;d ever wanted 
to say...
	&quot;Chibiusa...&quot; I managed to whisper, and for awhile I wasn&#39;t sure she had 
heard me.  But when she opened those red eyes to look at me, those deep red 
eyes that plagued me with their depths, tortured me because I knew I had 
fallen into them, were now full of desire and something else.
	&quot;Please, Hotaru...don&#39;t say anything.  Just...&quot; she swallowed hard, almost 
uncomfortably.  &quot;Just please, kiss me...&quot;
	I didn&#39;t know what to do.  Like a fool, I stared at her for quite some 
time.  But, finally, the only part of my mind that actually thought caught 
on.  I leaned toward those soft lips again, this time slowly...my eyes 
closed, and I felt those soft little lips against mine.  Her eyelashes 
brushed my cheek as her arms came around my neck, and the soft little 
sensations sent my mind whirling, little butterflies and fireworks the color 
of her hair swirling around together.  The biggest explosion, however, was 
the amazing feeling of her impatient leg wrenching itself between my legs.
	The kiss wasn&#39;t broken, but I hissed aloud.  She seemed to catch the 
sound, and moved around so that my right leg was between both of hers.  The small 
&quot;oh&quot; that escaped that beautiful mouth was enough.
	I broke the kiss and looked deep into those red eyes.  It was time.
	I laid her back gently on the couch, her lower back resting on one of the 
armrests.  Her small hands slid down to my waist, then up to my breasts 
again.  The feelings were wonderful, I admit, but I had only one goal in 
mind.  I was going to make her happy...so happy...
	When our hips met that first time, it sparked something more than desire 
in the both of us.  I still remember the sound of her breathless moan in my 
ear, the way her arms locked around my neck, the feeling of her legs wrapped 
around my waist.  I still remember those tensed muscles, the heavy 
breathing, and the small moans that increased to loud groans as our 
ministrations continued.  Oh, she was so beautiful, those eyes that had me 
sinking shut tight, little beads of sweat dotting her forehead and making 
her hair a darker shade of pink.  Those moans, cutting through the noise of 
the TV that was still on and going right into my mind, causing the fireworks 
to become huge bombs of pleasure.
	And when I felt her body tense, and the deep movements of her hips that 
followed, I knew what was to come...my own fabulous release...my head shot 
up to the ceiling, my eyes closed, my hips bucking and trying to drown 
themselves in her own.  She held my waist fast, making sure it went to all 
the right places.  The sounds of our moans mixed together filled my ears and 
my mind, and it was all I could do not to die of pure blissful pleasure.
	But that blissful high brought us crashing down.  We were like that for a 
few moments that seemed so long but so short...then, my body still shaking, 
I fell atop her in a sweaty heap.  Our breathing was heavy and deep, but we 
held each other until it calmed down.
	Warm, my fuzzy mind said.  That&#39;s the first thing I knew as I opened my 
eyes.  Warm.  Warmth.  So warm.  I lifted my head slightly, my vision 
clearing as sleep left me.  I looked up to see Chibiusa, sleeping so softly. 
  Her breathing was so comforting, her chest lifting up slowly and softly.  
I smiled.  She was beautiful, even when she was sleeping.  Especially when 
she was sleeping.
	I laid my head back down as gently as I could, but evidently that wasn&#39;t 
soft enough.  She stirred, and I cursed myself for waking her.
	&quot;Mmm...Hotaru?&quot;  She rubbed her left eye with her hand, as if to rub the 
last bits of sleep away.
	&quot;Hi...&quot; I said, my voice still husky.  &quot;How are you?&quot;
	&quot;Wonderful.&quot;  She smiled, and I giggled slightly.  &quot;You know what?&quot;  The 
tone was different, making me cease all movement.  I knew that tone.  It was 
so...serious.
	&quot;What?&quot;  Panic rose in my chest, and my heart began to thud quite rapidly.
	&quot;I...&quot; Those red eyes turned away from me.  &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it.&quot;  
She laughed slightly, almost sarcastically.  &quot;Me, not knowing how to say 
something.  Ironic.&quot;
	&quot;Chibiusa...you&#39;re...I don&#39;t understand.  What can&#39;t you say?&quot;  I began to 
worry about my heartbeat.
	&quot;I have to tell you something, Hotaru.  And it&#39;s very important.  It has 
to do with all this,&quot; she waved her hand to the couch and to us.  I tilted my 
head to the side, still confused.  &quot;I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re going to react 
to me telling you what I need to say.&quot;
	&quot;Chibiusa, whatever it is...please tell me.  I want to know.  I promise, I 
won&#39;t make fun of you, or act weird.  Just please, tell me.&quot;  I was trying 
to strain my voice so she could know how much I cared, but my heart seemed 
to be preventing it.  The thudding was so violent I clutched at my chest in 
pure worry.
	&quot;Hotaru...I...&quot; still hesitant...still trying to hard, &quot;I...love you.&quot;  
She closed her eyes and let out a deep breath.  I stared at her, that beautiful 
form, for a long time.  Finally, I managed to part my heavy lips and speak.
	It came out in barely a whisper.  But she still heard me.  &quot;I love you, 
too.&quot;
