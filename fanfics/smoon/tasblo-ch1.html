---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The taste of blood on my lips. That&#39;s all I have 
left of her. Sweet and bitter. Warm. I can still 
feel it.

 The blade went smoothly through her chest. Into 
her left breast slicing her heart in two. When 
the first trickles of blood appeared she was 
still smiling. How could you have done this to 
me? How could you have asked that of me?

 &quot;You have to do it. When I die the Ginzuishou 
will restore everything. I die so everyone else 
can live. It has to be this way. And you have to 
do it. Only the destructive power of Saturn can 
kill me.&quot;

 It was so easy. When the blade went through her 
flesh I couldn&#39;t feel any resistance. Soon her 
whole dress - white before - was red with her 
blood.

 When she was lying there, the Ginzuishou keeping 
her still alive, she opened her mouth to speak. I 
brought my face closer so she wouldn&#39;t strain 
herself too much. She told me to close my eyes. 
Then she put her hands to the sides of my face 
and brought my face closer to hers. She kissed 
me. Lightly. Sweetly. Gently. But all that filled 
my mind was the taste of blood on my lips. No 
emotions came up.

 When I opened my eyes she had closed hers 
already. A single tear fell onto her eyelid. I 
got up and turned to walk away. Behind me I felt 
warmth, but it wasn&#39;t her warmth, it was the 
power of the Ginzuishou. Pink ribbons began 
flying everywhere, green plants began covering 
the gray surface, the black emptiness above was 
replaced by a blue sky and white clouds. The 
puffy ones, the ones she loved so much. She 
always recognized some animals or people in them.

 The princess of the Moon possesses the ability 
to contain its power while the Princess of Saturn 
possesses the ability to unleash it. That is what 
she told me once. Then she added that we are the 
perfect couple and we laughed. Life will begin 
anew, no, it will be restored, now that she is 
dead.

 Now I am on Saturn, an outcast from the Moon 
Kingdom. The Senshi exiled me here because I 
never explained what happened. They thought I 
killed the Princess and so I did, that is why I 
do not wish to go back.

 When I am alone I can feel it. The warmth. It&#39;s 
not the power of her protecting crystal, but her 
warmth that I feel. When I close my eyes I can 
recall our first kiss but with that her last 
minutes. And the taste of blood on my lips. So I 
don&#39;t. I&#39;m content in the warmth that surrounds 
me ever since.
