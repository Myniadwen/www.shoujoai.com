<h1>Secrets and Things Not Well Hidden (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crawlspace.html">Crawlspace</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/secthings-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Clouds skirted across the sky, obscuring the moon and making  
patchwork of the stars.  Serena hurried up the steps of Hikawa Shrine,  
wishing not for the first time that Grandpa Hino would install an  
escalator. 	

Finally, she reached the top of the hill and paused to catch her  
breath.  Now that she was here, Serena wasn&#146;t certain how she was 
going  to bring up the subject of the kissing cousins with her friend. 	

&#147;About time you got here.&#148; 	

The voice from the darkness startled Serena and she stumbled  
backwards.  Clutching her chest, her breathing hard, she searched for  
the source of the voice. 	

&#147;God, Raye!  You scared me!&#148; yelled Serena once she was able to  
discern her friend&#146;s figure.  Then a confused look came to her face.   
&#147;How&#146;d you know I was coming?&#148; 	

&#147;The fire knows all and sees all,&#148; deadpanned Raye.  Then she  
grinned.  &#147;And your mom called all of us wanting to know if we&#146;d heard  
from you.  She wants you to call her.  You need to call the others, 
too, and let them know you&#146;re okay.  Honestly, Serena, you should know  
better than to be running off without your communicator.&#148; 	

When they got inside, Serena started a slow trudge towards the  phone.  
Raye gave her a little shove to get her moving. 	

&#147;Be quick about it.  And if your mom isn&#146;t too mad at you, ask  her if 
you can spend the night.  The storm&#146;s going to break soon.  No  point 
in you getting caught in it trying to get home.&#148;   	

------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearly an hour later, Serena sat in Raye&#146;s room chewing on the  end of 
her ponytail.  Her mom had said she could stay the night at  Raye&#146;s.  
She&#146;d also said, in typical irate mother fashion, that if  Serena ever 
ran off like that again without telling her where she was  going, she 
wouldn&#146;t need to bother coming home again. 	

After that, she and Raye had spent more time than necessary  setting 
up the pull-out and getting ready for bed.  Serena had tried a  few 
times to bring up the reason for her visit, but each time the words  
would die in her throat. 	

After a handful of false starts, Raye&#146;s patience was wearing thin.   
&#147;Spit it out all ready, Serena!&#148; 	

Serena stopped chewing on her hair and let it fall from her mouth. 

Raye rolled her eyes.  &#147;Not your hair, idiot!  The reason you  came 
all the way over here in the middle of the night.  What&#146;s the big 
emergency?&#148; 	

Serena looked down at her fidgeting hands, her face growing warm.   
&#147;Oh.  Well, um, you see, I saw this picture.  It was Amara, and she 
was,  well&#133; (ambiguous hand gesture) with this girl, and she kinda 
sorta  looked like, um&#133;&#148; 	

A not-very-well-hidden giggle made Serena look up.  The huge grin  and 
laughter in Raye&#146;s eyes made her forget her embarrassment and her  
train of thought. 	

&#147;What&#146;s so funny?&#148; demanded Serena. 	

&#147;You are, princess.  Have you really just now figured it out?&#148; 	

&#147;What!  You mean you knew?&#148; 	

&#147;Everybody knows, Serena.  It&#146;s obvious.  Amara acts like a guy,  
dresses like a guy, and flirts with everything in a skirt.  She might  
as well have a neon sign taped to her forehead that says &#145;I am a  
lesbian.&#146;&#148; 	

Serena stared at her, bug-eyed.  &#147;B-b-but Michelle&#133;&#148; 	

Raye couldn&#146;t keep the sarcasm out of her voice as she said, &#147;I&#146;m 
pretty sure she knows.  I doubt she has a problem with it, seeing as  
how close they are.&#148;       

~You don&#146;t know the half of it,~ thought Serena. 	

Raye pulled her pillow into her lap and leaned forward, looking  more 
intently at her friend.  &#147;You&#146;re really bugged out about this,  aren&#146;t 
you, Serena?&#148; 	

&#147;No, I&#146;m not!&#148; 	

&#147;You are.  I can tell by the look on your face.&#148;  Raye leaned  back 
and shook her head.  &#147;I wouldn&#146;t have expected that kind of  reaction 
from you.  Chad, okay, sure.  But not from you.&#148; 	

&#147;I told you, I don&#146;t care if she likes girls.  And what does Chad  
have to do with it?&#148; 	

&#147;You remember that trolley youma we had to fight.  It was around  
then.  Chad saw me with Amara, and she was doing her usual flirt 
thing.  I don&#146;t know what he was thinking.  That she could &#145;turn&#146; me 
or  something equally stupid.  Whatever it was, he wound up trying to 
fight  her to save my honor.&#148;  Raye shrugged.  &#147;No one ever said he 
was the brightest bulb on the Ferris wheel, but at least he cares.&#148; 	

Raye fell backwards onto her pillows and turned towards Serena.   She 
smiled at the blonde, and after a few seconds got the reaction she  
was hoping for. 	

Serena relaxed a bit and smiled back at Raye.  Then she pulled  her 
blanket to her and lay back against her own pillows. 	

&#147;Get some sleep, Serena,&#148; Raye said as she got up to turn off the  
lights.  &#147;If you want, we&#146;ll talk about it some more in the morning  
while you help me with my chores.&#148; 	

Serena didn&#146;t get a chance to protest the shrine chores before  the 
room went dark.  She heard Raye pad across the floor and get back  
into bed.  It didn&#146;t take long for Raye&#146;s breathing to even out and 
the  soft snoring to start. 	

Serena lay there listening to Raye and the rain.  Two opposing  forces 
that were both keeping her awake. 	

The talk with Raye had gone completely off course.  Though she  had 
gotten a sort of half answer from the miko.  Serena admitted to  
herself that she had never known about Amara&#146;s preferences.  It just  
wasn&#146;t something she thought about.  But it did make sense, and added 
a  piece to the puzzle she hadn&#146;t realized she was missing. 	

Michelle, though, still seemed to be a missing piece.  The girl  had 
more boyfriends than Mina had crushes.  So why get involved with  any 
girl, let alone her own cousin? 	

Serena rolled onto her side and started chewing on her ponytail  
again.  The rain was beating mercilessly against the windows.  She  
wondered how Raye could sleep through it all. 	

As she watched the water cascade down the window, a new idea came  to 
Serena.  She would go to Amy.  Amy and her superbrain had gotten  them 
around and out of all sorts of situations.  As she finally began  to 
drift off to sleep, Serena became certain that Amy could help her  out 
with this situation, also.
