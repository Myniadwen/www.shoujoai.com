<h1>The New Moon's Decision</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/missparapara.html">Miss ParaPara</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This fanfic takes place in 30th century Crystal Tokyo, after a war between 
Earth &amp; a planet called Dominion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot; We won!&quot; Sailor Venus jumped up &amp; down as she gave Sailor Jupiter a 
high 5.
	&quot; Oh no!&quot; cried Sailormars,&quot; Neo-Queen Serenity. She&#39;s hurt&quot;.
	All the senshi ran to the Queen. Many people of Crystal Tokyo also 
gathered.
	&quot; Usagi!&quot; Mars held up the Queen head. The Queen had been severely 
hurt by a explosion of bombs set by the enemy. She could feel that she was 
slowly dying. If only she could have made it back to the palace, she would 
have been safe. Oh poor Mamoru &amp; Chibiusa. If only she could see them again.
	Sailormercury did a scan with her computer to see how bad the Queen&#39;s 
condition was.
	&quot; She&#39;s going to die.&quot; Mercury said softly before she burst into 
tears.
	The large group of people heard this. Their Queen was dying!
	&quot; Don&#39;t worry, Usagi-chan,&quot; cried Sailor Jupiter,&quot; We defeated those 
jerks from Dominion. Our world is safe once again.&quot; She as well as the other 
senshi burst into tears.
	&quot; Please promise me,&quot; Neo-Queen Serenity said as she closed her eyes 
for one last time,&quot; Make sure Chibiusa becomes a great Queen just as I tried 
to be. Tell her I believe in her....&quot; The Queen&#39;s voice drifted off. She 
turned her head in Sailormars hands &amp; died.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Oh yum!&quot; exclaimed Chibiusa. Setsuna had brought over a batch of 
chocolate chip cookies to the Palace. King Endymion was informed of his 
wife&#39;s death, but Chibiusa still did not know that her mother was now in 
Heaven. Setsuna thought she might be able to tell Chibiusa about it in a 
better way than anyone else. 
	Setsuna was surprised &amp; kind of disappointed when she showed up at the 
Palace and saw that Hotaru was there also( Chibiusa had invited her over for 
tea). Setsuna sat the cookies on the table. Chibiusa dug right in, while shy, 
polite Hotaru hung back.
	&quot; You may have some too, Hotaru&quot; Setsuna told the dark haired girl.
	&quot; Arigato, Setsuna-san.&quot; Hotaru took a cookie.
	After all the cookies were gone ( that wasn&#39;t long since Chibiusa 
loved Setsuna&#39;s homemade chocolate chip cookies), the girls were full.
	&quot; That was delicious, Puu. I must admit your cookies are even better 
that Makoto&#39;s. And she&#39;s Tokyo&#39;s best cook!&quot;
	&quot; I&#39;m glad you liked them, your Highness. But Hotaru must leave now. 
I have important news to tell you.&quot; Setsuna looked at Hotaru.
	&quot; Hey why did you call me your Highness? I thought that&#39;s what you 
call my Mommy. And why does Hotaru have to leave? Why Puu?&quot; Chibiusa could 
sense that something was very wrong.
	Hotaru got up to leave, but Setsuna stopped her.
	&quot; Stay. I must now obey the new Queen.&quot; Setsuna grabbed Hotaru&#39;s arm 
 &amp; Hotaru sat back down.
	Chibiusa knew then that something happened to her mother after she 
left the Palace to go help the other Sailor Senshi fight the people of 
Dominion.
	&quot; Why did this have to happen!&quot; Chibiusa was furious,&quot; She should 
have never left the Palace. This is all her fault!&quot; Chibiusa got off the 
couch, crying, and ran to her room, locking the door behind her.
	&quot; I&#39;ll better leave for now,&quot; Setsuna stood up,&quot; Please be a comfort 
to her Hotaru. She really needs her friends right now.&quot; Setsuna left to go 
talk to King Endymion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knock knock knock!

	Hotaru rapped on Chibiusa&#39;s bedroom door. Chibiusa was inside crying.
	&quot; Go away, Puu! I never want to see you again.&quot;
	&quot; Chibiusa-chan. It&#39;s me, Hotaru.&quot;
	It was quiet for a moment, then Chibiusa told her to enter.
	Hotaru sat on Chibiusa&#39;s bed with her.
	&quot; Oh, Hotaru,&quot; Chibiusa cried,&quot; I feel so alone. I miss her so much.&quot; 
Chibiusa sobbed into Hotaru&#39;s shirt.
	&quot; It will be alright,&quot; Hotaru ran her fingers though Chibiusa&#39;s pink 
odangos,&quot; I know how you feel. I felt the same way when I lost my mom.&quot;
	Chibiusa stopped crying. She forgotten that Hotaru&#39;s mother was 
killed in a lab accident when Hotaru was very young. It must have been so 
hard on a little kid. For once in her life she knew there was someone who 
understood her pain.
	&quot; Hotaru-chan,&quot; Chibiusa looked into her best friend&#39;s violet eyes.
	&quot; Yes, Chibiusa,&quot; Hotaru looked into friend&#39;s tear filled eyes.
	&quot; I love you.&quot;
	These were words Hotaru had never heard directed at her before.
	&quot; I love you too, Chibiusa-chan.&quot;
	The two moved closer to each other and kissed hard on the lips. They 
knew then that there had always been a reason for the way they cared about 
each other. The reason was love.
	After they broke away from the kiss, Chibiusa began to take off her 
clothes.
	&quot; Ecchi, Chibiusa!&quot; exclaimed Hotaru, who was very surprised by this 
act.
	&quot; No it&#39;s not ecchi,&quot; explain Chibiusa,&quot; It&#39;s my way of expressing my 
love for you. I want to make love with you.&quot; Chibiusa stood buck naked into 
front of Hotaru. Hotaru couldn&#39;t take her eyes off Chibiusa&#39;s beautiful body.
	&quot; I would be honored to make love to you, my Queen.&quot; Hotaru started 
to take her clothes off. She moved closer to Chibiusa &amp; grabbed one of 
Chibiusa firm breasts &amp; start to suck on it. Her tongue had little circles 
around the nipple, sending waves of passion though Chibiusa&#39;s body.
	&quot; Ohhhh!&quot; Chibiusa moaned in pleasure,&quot; That feels so good!!&quot; 
Chibiusa reached down and started to finger Hotaru&#39;s wet pussy. Hotaru&#39;s 
fingers started to do the same to Chibiusa. Until Chibiusa stuck a finger a 
little too deep into Hotaru.
	&quot;Oh!&quot; Hotaru cried in pain.
	&quot; What&#39;s wrong? What did I do Hotaru-chan?&quot; Chibiusa was now scared.
	&quot; It&#39;s not your fault, Chibiusa. See I&#39;m still a virgin &amp; you just 
hit against my hymen a little. I&#39;m o.k. Please continue giving me pleasure.&quot;
	The girls went back to their positions, then Hotaru had an idea.
	The girls got into a 69 position. Now each one could enjoy each 
others tasty pussy. Hotaru spread Chibiusa&#39;s outer lips apart &amp; wasn&#39;t 
surprised to see that the new Queen was also still a virgin. She learned well 
from her mother, Hotaru thought to herself.
	Chibiusa never knew Hotaru could produce such sweet juice. It was 
sweeter than any candy she ever tasted. She licked all around Hotaru&#39;s  wet 
lovebox. She felt as if she was getting drunk off her friend&#39;s cum.
	&quot; Chibiusa,&quot; Hotaru managed to say after Chibiusa&#39;s tongue had given 
her, her first orgasm. &quot; I want you to take my virginity.&quot;
	&quot; I wish I could but how..&quot; Just then Chibiusa remembered. She ran to 
her parent&#39;s room &amp; soon returned with a 7 inch attachable penis. Usagi had 
used it with all her female friends at one point in time. Chibiusa got 
excited when she seen that there was a little flap near the straps. When she 
put it on, the flap went into her pussy slightly. This toy could give her 
pleasure as well.
	&quot; O.K, Hotaru get on your hands &amp; knees.&quot; Hotaru obeyed. Chibiusa put 
the tip of the cock at Hotaru&#39;s entrance.
	&quot; Remember I love you.&quot; Chibiusa said as she pushed herself into
Hotaru. Hotaru could feel the pain, but it was soon replaced by a great 
pleasure. Chibiusa herself was also experiencing this new pleasure as the 
flap massaged her clit as she pumped into Hotaru. Chibiusa started to pick up 
the pace &amp; pumped harder. Hotaru came once again. The sight of Hotaru&#39;s cum 
pouring out of her pussy caused Chibiusa to also come. Chibiusa took off the 
fake dick &amp; they began to lick the cum out of each other&#39;s pussy. Just then 
an image of Neo-Queen Serenity appeared.
	&quot; Mommy!&quot; exclaimed Chibiusa,&quot; I&#39;m sorry for what I&#39;ve done. Please 
forgive me. I just love Hotaru so much. I...&quot;
	&quot; It&#39;s alright Small Lady,&quot; The Queen spoke,&quot; I want you to be happy. 
I&#39;ve made love to my friends before too. I hope the best for you two. And I 
hope Hotaru can have the pleasure of taking you as well. Bye for now, my 
sweet daughter.&quot; The image disappeared.
	&quot; Well you heard your mom,&quot; Hotaru said,&quot; I want to make you mine.&quot;
	&quot; I&#39;m already yours.&quot; Chibiusa &amp; Hotaru kissed again. Then Hotaru 
slipped on the fake dick and the magic started all over again.
