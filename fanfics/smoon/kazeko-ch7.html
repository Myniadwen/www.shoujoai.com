<h1>Kazeko (part 7 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Michiru embraced each of the younger senshi as they entered her house, 
overflowing with a joy she couldn&#39;t quite understand.  Haruka kept 
telling her that she was just incredibly excited about their upcoming 
wedding, but Michiru kept getting a sense from the Aqua Mirror that she 
had done some of this before, that there was another reason for her 
unexplainable happiness.  She&#39;d figure it out eventually.  She herded 
them all into the living room, gesturing for them to find a seat.  
Makoto caught Ami and pulled her onto the floor at the base of the couch 
that Usagi and Mamoru chose, Rei and Minako squeezing in beside the 
prince and princess, and Michiru stood in the middle of the room, 
grinning.  Setsuna entered the room from the hallway that led to the 
den, long green hair hanging down her back, dressed in a form-fitting 
black tuxedo.
 
&quot;Wow,&quot; Usagi whispered; &quot;kirei.&quot;  Her blue-eyed boyfriend, wisely 
enough, remained silent, thinking about anything and everything except 
the Senshi of Time.
 
Setsuna smiled.  &quot;Thank you, Usagi.  Haruka-san has asked me to be 
&#39;father of the bride&#39; and, against my better judgment, I have agreed.&quot;  
Her eyes sparkled at Usagi&#39;s comment, a hidden fire in those garnet 
depths.  There was someone she could be &#39;father of the bride&#39; to.  The 
little Moon Princess had grown so much . . . She caught Rei&#39;s attentive 
eyes on her and looked away, desperate to preserve this secret, at 
least.  Rei didn&#39;t know, she only suspected, and as long as Setsuna 
didn&#39;t do anything overtly suspicious, she&#39;d be fine.

Haruka cleared her throat, and all eyes turned toward the den.
 
&quot;Haruka,&quot; Michiru breathed.  Haruka grumpily crossed her arms over her 
chest, pulling at the gold-embroidered dark blue tuxedo jacket.
 
&quot;This thing is ridiculously uncomfortable,&quot; the blonde growled as two of 
the fashion designers from the company Setsuna had found to do the 
wedding clothes flitted in behind her, the two women whispering to each 
other, adjusting, and measuring.  &quot;And these guys,&quot; Haruka hissed, 
raising her arms and glancing at the pests by her sides, &quot;could get on 
someone&#39;s nerves very quickly.&quot;
 
Michiru floated up to Haruka and placed her small hands on her lover&#39;s 
chest.  &quot;I like it Haruka; you look very handsome.  I love those colors 
on you.  But if you would rather wear a dress . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Hmph.  When have you ever known me to wear a dress?&quot;
 
Setsuna laughed, one particular image from the Silver Millennium 
flashing through her mind of a young blonde princess wearing a golden 
dress to please her aqua-haired lover.  She covered her mouth quickly, 
knowing that none of the younger senshi would understand.  Luckily for 
her and the secrets of the Silver Millennium, the only two men in the 
group of designers entered the room, gesturing at Mamoru.
 
&quot;Sumimasen, Chiba-kun?&quot;
 
&quot;Hai?&quot;
 
&quot;Please come with us to be fitted for your tuxedo.&quot;  Usagi laughed at 
that, multiple images of Tuxedo Kamen filling her mind.  One thing her 
boyfriend did not need was another tuxedo.  The black-haired Earth 
Prince glared at his fianc&eacute;e before following the designers into one of 
the empty guest rooms.  Hotaru rushed into the living room as Setsuna 
and Haruka returned to the bedrooms so their tuxedos could be finished.
 
&quot;When did I wear a dress?  Setsuna-san?&quot;  Michiru laughed as she closed 
the door behind her lover, knowing that the garnet-eyed Senshi of Time 
would never speak.  She secretly suspected that something very traumatic 
happened to Setsuna in the Silver Millennium, something more tragic than 
losing the younger Senshi, something that she never wanted to remember.  
The Outer Senshi had agreed to respect her privacy.  &quot;Are you guys 
ready?  The head of this designer business will soon arrive with her 
closest assistants.&quot;
 
Usagi giggled, hastily covering her mouth with her hands.  &quot;I love new 
dresses!  Are they good designers, Michiru-san?&quot;
 
&quot;Setsuna-san says so.  She never actually met the head designer, but 
this company is renowned throughout Japan for their good work.  Their 
fame is even spreading to America and they&#39;re going to open a branch 
there soon.&quot;
 
A knock at the door announced the arrival of the rest of the team.  They 
hadn&#39;t been able to come with the tuxedo makers due to an earlier 
engagement, but they arrived as quickly as possible.  Michiru rushed to 
the door, and a virtual army of women laden with cloth and supplies, 
including small, handheld sewing machines, entered.  The younger ones 
spread out their supplies in the room, each grabbing measuring tapes and 
heading for the younger six senshi waiting on the couches.  The 
silver-haired leader, her hair pulled back in an intricate braid to keep 
it out of her work, bowed to her host, her violet eyes widening in alarm 
and recognition, emotions hidden so fast that Michiru wasn&#39;t sure what 
she had seen.  Michiru almost recognized the slender woman.  &quot;Forgive 
their enthusiasm, Kaiou-san, but they are very eager to work on this 
project.  We haven&#39;t done such a non-traditional wedding in a long 
time.&quot;
 
&quot;How did you know my name?&quot;
 
&quot;Easy, the other owners of this house wanted tuxedos.  I don&#39;t remember 
their names, but you&#39;re that famous artist and violinist.  I&#39;ve been a 
fan of your work for a long time.  I hear you have a partner now, in 
music and art, and I assume it&#39;s the person you&#39;re marrying.  I am 
Hikarino Ailan, owner, founder, and head designer of Moonlight 
Fashions.&quot;
 
&quot;Kaiou Michiru, though the introduction seems so useless now.&quot;  Michiru 
smiled as she pointed at the women scattered through her living room, 
each surrounded by designers and already being measured for their 
dresses.  &quot;These are Tsukino Usagi, my Maid of Honor, and the 
Bridesmaids Aino Minako, Hino Rei, Kino Makoto, and Mizuno Ami.  And 
this is Hotaru-chan, my adopted daughter and the flower girl.&quot;
 
&quot;Dozo yoroshiku,&quot; the girls called together, bowing automatically.
 
&quot;Dozo yoroshiku,&quot; Ailan smiled, bowing.  &quot;Then let&#39;s get started, ne?&quot;  
She waved her hands majestically, and the assistants swarmed&#151;there was 
no other word for it&#151;over the women as Ailan pulled Michiru to one side.  
&quot;Okay, young bride, what kind of dress were you thinking about?&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Setsuna listened to the wind, wondering what subtle messages Haruka 
could hear in the insistent howling.  Ignoring the sound and the 
answering turmoil in her heart, she let the cool air wash over her.  
&quot;Setsuna-san?&quot;
 
The Senshi of Time, taking a break from the constant fitting and sewing, 
smiled as the young Senshi of Fire joined her.  The tuxedos were all 
finished, and the dresses were nearly complete, including the one Rei 
was wearing.  &quot;Yes?&quot;
 
&quot;Setsuna-san, I wanted to apologize.  I didn&#39;t mean to upset you 
earlier; I was just angry and very confused.  I wanted so much to 
remember the Silver Millennium that I didn&#39;t realize that there must be 
very good reasons for you to hold back out memories.  I would probably 
make the same choice if I was in your shoes back then&#151;err, boots,&quot; she 
amended, referring to the boots Setsuna wore as Sailor Pluto.  They 
laughed lightly, the tension of the moment broken by Rei&#39;s words.
 
Setsuna sighed as the two let the wind pull at their long, silky hair.  
&quot;There are many things I should let myself remember, Rei-chan.  I&#39;ve 
buried everything because of a few things I can&#39;t bear to relive.  As 
old as I am, I served three Moon Princesses, and lived alone at the Time 
Gate from the end of the Silver Millennium until only a few years ago.  
The Silver Millennium was a wonderful age, full of power and love and 
most of it was good.  But there was pain in the final battle and I lost 
everyone I&#39;ve ever known and loved.  She wouldn&#39;t let me die for her.  
She sent me to the Time Gate, ordered me not to fight, because she loved 
me and she wanted her daughter to have a future.&quot;
 
&quot;Queen Serenity sent you away?  She wouldn&#39;t let you fight?&quot;
 
Setsuna shook her head.  &quot;Everyone else was allowed to fight and die 
with their lovers, but I was not.  I held her as she died, and I was the 
only one left.  You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be the only one left.  
I loved you girls so much, and I don&#39;t ever want to lose any of you ever 
again.&quot;
 
&quot;Especially your daughter.&quot;
 
Setsuna gasped, eyes wide, her entire focus on the black-haired woman 
before her.  &quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;I was right, then.  You were the King of the Moon, and that&#39;s why Usagi 
can&#39;t ever remember her father.  He wasn&#39;t a man.  And that&#39;s where most 
of your pain comes from; you had to watch your lover and your daughter 
die, and the Laws of Balance wouldn&#39;t let you intervene.&quot;
 
&quot;We went through so much to give her a normal life,&quot; Setsuna whispered, 
unable to hold back any longer.  &quot;We lied to the kingdom, our fellow 
senshi, our families . . . we gave up our love for her, but in the end 
it wasn&#39;t enough.&quot;  She felt tears run down her cheeks, a very 
unfamiliar sensation, and Rei reached a concerned hand up to wipe them 
away.  &quot;You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to kill your own secret identity 
to protect your only daughter and then being forced to watch her grow up 
from planets away, never able to hold her, or kiss her, or tell her 
stories.  I missed everything the first time, and most of it this time.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s why you latched onto Chibiusa so.  She&#39;s just little Usagi.&quot;
 
Setsuna nodded, drying her tears, then she looked up at Rei, garnet eyes 
dark.  &quot;Please don&#39;t tell her, Rei-chan.  She&#39;s happier not knowing.&quot;
 
&quot;Why?&quot;
 
&quot;Rei-chan, I would have given up everything for Serenity&#151;my kingdom, my 
senshi powers, my very life&#151;but I couldn&#39;t even sacrifice my pride for 
her, for my daughter.  At the first sign of pregnancy, we made plans to 
kill the Moon King.  I only saw little Serenity the day she was born and 
the day of her reception&#151;after that, I stayed away from the Moon until 
the last ball, just before the end.&quot;
 
&quot;You should tell her one day.  You loved her enough to sacrifice your 
love and give her up to protect her future and her reputation.  I 
respect your decision, and your choice not to release our memories.  
You&#39;re a stronger woman than I, Setsuna-san.&quot;  Rei put her arms around 
the lonely woman, lending her strength to face the world calmly.  &quot;I 
won&#39;t tell anyone, Setsuna-san; that&#39;s your secret and your burden.&quot;
 
&quot;How did you know, Rei-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;Fire-reading, as usual.  You have a lot of candles in the living room, 
and I lit a few when they gave me a break.  It took a little 
concentration, but I managed an image of the Moon King when I was 
thinking about you.  I wasn&#39;t sure until we spoke.&quot;
 
&quot;Is that why you came out here?&quot;  Setsuna smiled tolerantly, in a much 
better mood now that she had been able to tell her greatest secret to 
someone.  That secret had been known to only two people in the entire 
Silver Millennium, including herself and Serenity.
 
&quot;No, I really did come to apologize, but why waste the opportunity.&quot;  
Rei took Setsuna&#39;s arm, glad that the older senshi was feeling better, 
and turned to return to the living room and the dress fitting.  &quot;You 
should come meet this designer, Hikarino Ailan.  She&#39;s fabulous!&quot;
 
&quot;Perhaps I will.&quot;</pre>
