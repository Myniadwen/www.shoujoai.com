<h1>Senshi Sabers (part 1 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Rei Hino led her band up on to the stage, assessing the rowdy crowd 
with a single glance. She looked back at her band mates, &quot;Hurricane, 
on three!&quot; She gave them a moment, then counted down, &quot;One... two.. 
three!&quot; The band exploded into their signature tune, &quot;Hello, 
Hurricane,&quot; and the crowd sat up and took notice.

Rei was belting out the tunes in her harsh, raspy voice, moving from 
song to song in perfect sequence. She was angry, about being called in 
at the last minute, about the crowd&#39;s hostility, about a lot of 
things, and she was letting that anger fire her songs with passion.

By the end of the last set, the crowd had mellowed, accepting the 
replacement, and the club&#39;s owner was beaming happily at them. &#39;We&#39;ll 
probably be playing this dive again,&#39; Rei thought wryly. As she left 
the stage she felt eyes on her, and looked up, only to see a blue 
haired figure leaving the club. With a shrug she went into the 
dressing room to change, toweling the sweat away and pulling her stage 
leathers off, then she waved good-bye to her band mates and left.

The motorcycle started up smoothly, Rei pulled her helmet on over her 
short black hair and pulled out into the rain. She wasn&#39;t on the road 
long before another vehicle pulled in behind her own. Rei spotted the 
sports car almost immediately, and picked up the pace a bit.

They were soon playing a game on those rain slick streets, a wild bit 
of cat and mouse as Rei took the turns sharply and pulled a few rapid 
accelerations. But the car managed to keep pace, driven with both 
precision and a bit of guts.

&quot;They&#39;re serious about this, whoever they are,&quot; Rei muttered. She 
slowed down, picking a deserted stretch of highway to finally slow to 
a stop. She climbed off her motorcycle, popped the kickstand and 
leaned up against the powerful machine to wait for her hunter.

The sports car smoothly glided to a stop just ahead of where Rei 
stood, and waited there a moment. Rei felt the comforting weight of 
the knife she always carried and waited patiently. The door slid open 
and she was mildly surprised to see a woman get out, pausing a moment 
to take off a pair of stylish but simple glasses.

She walked forward neared to one of the street lights, and Rei saw a 
few more details. Short blue hair in a boyish cut, a beautiful face 
but very reserved, But it was the eyes that struck Rei. There was pain 
in her eyes, the pain of a person who has lost someone terribly 
precious. It was a look Rei was quite familiar with, knowing that her 
own eyes carried much the same thing.

&quot;Rei Hino?&quot; the blue haired young woman called out.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Rei looked at her cautiously.

&quot;My name is Ami Mizuno,&quot; she smiled slightly as she stopped a few 
steps from Rei, &quot;and I have a business proposition for you.&quot;

Rei blew out a angry breath, &quot;Not interested.&quot; She turned around, 
pulled her bike up, and prepared to climb back on.

&quot;I know about your Grandfather, the shrine,&quot; Ami said quietly, &quot;and 
what happened to him when he refused to sell the land to the Infinity 
Organization.&quot;

Rei froze, a flash of memory striking her. Coming home to the shrine, 
and finding his body there. Beaten to death, a random killing, the 
police had said, ignoring the pressure that Infinity had been putting 
on them, ignoring all the veiled threats.

&quot;It&#39;s all ancient history,&quot; Rei grated out, &quot;the cops couldn&#39;t do 
anything.&quot;

&quot;How would you like the chance to make Infinity and Prof. Tomoe pay 
for what they did?&quot; Ami asked quietly.

Rei met her eyes, and saw sincerity in them. She didn&#39;t let herself 
think too hard before answering, &quot;Keep talking.&quot;

&quot;Instead of talking, why not just follow me,&quot; Ami said. She climbed 
into her car and Rei fell in behind her, eventually pulling up to a 
tall office building, the first floor occupied by a business.

&quot;Silky Doll?&quot; Rei smiled slightly, following Ami inside.

The reserved young woman actually blushed a bit, as they walked 
through the racks of seductive clothing and even more revealing 
lingerie. Ami led Rei into a concealed elevator, and they swiftly 
descended into the basement of the building.

The doors hissed open, and Rei saw two other women waiting inside. 
&#39;Kami, she&#39;s tall,&#39; Rei thought, looking up at the brown haired woman. 
She was clearly athletic, muscles rippling on her arms, and her eyes 
were a startling shade of green. Lounging in another chair, a blonde 
haired woman was playing a video game and clearly winning. She was 
gorgeous, almost idol quality, even with her eyes riveted to the 
screen.

&quot;Makoto, Minako, I&#39;d like you to meet Rei Hino,&quot; Ami smiled.

&quot;So you&#39;re the newest recruit,&quot; the tall woman smiled, &quot;Makoto Kino,&quot; 
and she shook Rei&#39;s hand firmly.

The blonde finished her game, &quot;New high score!&quot; She bounced to her 
feet and smiled at Rei winningly, &quot;Minako Aino.&quot;

Rei pushed her hair back and shot a fierce look at Ami, &quot;What&#39;s going 
on?&quot;

&quot;Come with me,&quot; Ami calmly led the three into another room, both 
Minako and Makoto exchanging knowing glances.

&#39;They obviously know something I don&#39;t,&#39; Rei thought, trying to 
control her irritation. The room they entered was dark, until Ami hit 
a switch and lit up what waited for them. &quot;Wow,&quot; Rei found herself 
murmuring.

Four battle suits rested in charging stations against the wall. 
Smoothly female in appearance, they held carefully restrained power, 
each one looking battle ready. Makoto walked to the green suit, Minako 
to the golden armor, and Ami stood by an icy blue one.

&quot;This one is yours,&quot; Ami gestured to the blood red armor.

Rei walked over to it thoughtfully, looking down at the sleek suit. 
The helmet was warm in her hands, the weight comforting, and she knew, 
just knew that it would fit her like a glove. Rei looked up at Ami, 
&quot;You built these.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami nodded. She took a breath, &quot;The Infinity Organization and 
their bio-boomers are out of control. I want you to join us in 
fighting them.&quot;

Rei wanted to, Kami she wanted to, but... &quot;What&#39;s in it for me?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Ignoring your personal reasons,&quot; Ami actually smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll pay you 
all for each job, as we&#39;ll be taking on some mercenary assignments as 
a cover.&quot;

&quot;And why do you do this?&quot; Rei asked quietly.

Ami&#39;s voice became flat, devoid of emotion as she said, &quot;My Mother, 
Dr. Mizuno, helped develop the bio-boomer technology and Prof. Tomoe 
killed her once she was no longer useful.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rei said softly, now understanding where the loss Rei had 
seen in Ami&#39;s eyes had come from.

Alarms rang out in the small chamber, and Makoto cursed softly. &quot;Bad 
timing,&quot; she muttered, and began to strip down before pulling on a 
skin tight leotard.

Minako slapped her on the bottom, &quot;Looking good.&quot; She stripped too, 
then pulled on her golden suit of battle armor.

Ami picked up a leotard from a locker and held it out to Rei. &quot;We 
could use you out there,&quot; she said quietly, her eyes meeting Rei&#39;s.

Rei hesitated, then grabbed the leotard and stripped down herself. 
&quot;How hard is it to pilot one of these things?&quot; she nodded to the red 
suit.

&quot;It only magnifies your own muscle power,&quot; Ami began to change as she 
explained, &quot;the weapon system I&#39;ll explain on the way.&quot;

Rei noticed how shapely the slim woman was, stripped down to the 
leotard, and had to shake herself for a moment. She stepped into the 
front segment of the suit, and felt it fold itself around her. The 
body, arms, and legs locked into place, and she pulled the helmet on 
over her head. She took a few steps, balancing carefully on the 
metallic heels.

&quot;Nice fit,&quot; Rei opened and closed her fingers, looking down at the 
cannon built into the right arm. She raised it, pointing it at the 
wall as targeting displays came on line in the helmet. She lined up 
where she wanted to hit, and fired.

The metallic foot long needle cut through the air like a knife, 
digging deeply into the wall. After a few moments, Rei was surprised 
to see the spear explode into flames! &quot;Thermal charges,&quot; Ami explained 
as she shook her head ruefully adding, &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have any 
trouble with the weapon systems.&quot;

The truck was loaded up and they were quickly on the move, racing to 
where the crisis was unfolding. The bio-boomer&#39;s were an incredible 
innovation, organic robots that were supposed to serve humanity. But 
there was a grave flaw in their creation, and sometimes they would go 
rouge, becoming monstrous creatures.

&quot;Makoto, you and I go in first,&quot; Ami said intensely, &quot;Rei, this is 
your first time out, so you&#39;re our back up.&quot; She looked at Minako, &quot;Be 
ready to use the electronic counter measures to keep the AD Police off 
our backs, and the FX to cover our escape.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Minako nodded eagerly.

&quot;Ready to go,&quot; Makoto agreed.

&#39;No way I&#39;m hanging back,&#39; Rei thought to herself grimly, keeping 
silent.

The misshapen creature howled, tentacles writhing all around it as Ami 
and Makoto carefully moved in first. Silvery blades that trailed frost 
popped out of the wrists of Ami&#39;s armor, freezing and cutting at the 
creature. Then Makoto leapt in, her suit deploying electrified cutting 
cables that sliced and shocked it.

It staggered backward, and Rei saw it, &#39;An opening!&#39;

The suit moved like a dream as Rei went in for the kill. She used her 
cannon to break through it&#39;s weakened defenses, and then plunged her 
fist into it&#39;s chest. She reached around as she had been told and 
pulled out the heart crystal that powered it. The creature gurgled, 
it&#39;s body breaking down into a black ooze pooling around their feet.

Minako&#39;s urgent voice came over the radios, &quot;The AD Police are here! 
Ami, leave your calling card and let&#39;s go.&quot;

The cruiser pulled up into the lot even as Minako dropped a series of 
strobe flares that the other three used to get clear. The police, once 
their eyes cleared, found the remains of the bio-boomer, and something 
else.

Carved into the ground by a laser beam were the words, &quot;Senshi 
Sabers.&quot;

The tall blonde with her long hair tied up in buns slammed her fist 
down on the top of her AD Police cruiser. &quot;The Senshi Sabers beat us 
to the punch again,&quot; Usagi complained, &quot;and now there&#39;s another one of 
them!&quot;

Her partner, Naru, shook her head, &quot;Why are you so hung up on them?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Usagi sighed, &quot;I just am.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re too tense,&quot; Naru reached out to put her hand on Usagi&#39;s arm. 
She smiled slightly, &quot;Come home with me tonight, I&#39;ll make a new woman 
of you.&quot;

Usagi climbed into the cruiser with a sigh, &quot;I&#39;ve got a headache.&quot;

Naru pouted, climbing in the other side, &quot;But that&#39;s what you always 
say!&quot;

The trip back to the Silky Doll was quiet, all of them lost in their 
own thoughts. Minako and Makoto disrobed quickly, changing and leaving 
together walking hand in hand. &#39;Interesting, very interesting&#39; Rei 
thought.

The armor came off easily, and Rei stood there a moment dressed in her 
leotard only, gazing at the helmet in her hands thoughtfully. She 
sensed a presence, and looked up to see Ami Mizuno looking at her, her 
expression utterly unreadable.

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;I&#39;ll have to keep in mind that you don&#39;t always obey orders,&quot; Ami 
said quietly, &quot;but other than that, good job.&quot;

Having said her piece, Ami should have left, but she lingered, gazing 
at Rei. Rei put her helmet with the rest of the suit, then advanced on 
Ami slowly. Ami&#39;s eyes widened slightly, but the leotard clad woman 
didn&#39;t flee.

&quot;I saw you at the concert,&quot; Rei murmured softly. A slight smile, &quot;Was 
there another reason you asked me to join your little crusade?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami admitted quietly. Her breath seemed to come a bit faster, 
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t... I&#39;m your employer now.&quot;

&quot;But do you want to,&quot; Rei murmured softly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami sighed out her surrender, and pressed her lips to Rei&#39;s. 
The first kiss was fleeting, a bare brushing of lips. Then Rei pulled 
her close, kissing her with a passion.

Re felt Ami&#39;s fingers in her hair, bodies close, then gentle tugging 
on her leotard when...

BBZZZZTT! Rei flailed about her wildly, eventually quieting the alarm 
clock sitting beside her bed. She rubbed at her eyes and staggered out 
of bed, her long hair standing up all around her head. &quot;That&#39;s the 
last time I watch Bubblegum Crisis and then polish off half a fully 
loaded pizza before going to bed,&quot; she muttered.

Rei staggered into the bathroom, splashing cold water on her face. She 
was brushing her teeth when a particular bit of the dream came back to 
her vividly, her kissing Ami passionately. &quot;Where on earth did that 
come from?&quot; she muttered softly.

------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s Notes: A Sailor Moon One-shot! My first ever, as I always 
seem to do mini-series and stuff on them. This was just a wacky idea I 
had, and jotted down for fun. But it just wouldn&#39;t go away, and I 
finally had to write it.

If you haven&#39;t seen Bubblegum Crisis, Rei is in the place of the main 
character Priss, Ami is Sylia, Makoto is Linna, Minako is Nene, Usagi 
is Leon and Naru is Daley. Prof. Tomoe and the Infinity Organization 
take the place of the main villains of Bubblegum Crisis, Quincy and 
his company Genom. This story is a bit of a blend of the original 
Bubblegum Crisis OVAs, and the Bubblegum Crisis 2040 series&#39; first 
episode.

The Usagi/ Naru conversation is, with some changes, directly from an 
episode of Bubblegum Crisis between Leon and Daley. Very funny, and I 
just had to slip it in. If you are interested in Bubblegum Crisis, I 
would recommend seeing the OVA series first, then try BGC 2040.

I know making it all a dream was a bit of a cop-out, but it seemed the 
best way to do it. If I&#39;m really tempted to do a sequel, I&#39;ll change 
the ending and move on from there. If you liked it, leave a review. If 
you hated it, leave one too, but I&#39;ll just ignore it...
