<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Usagi sipped her drink, glancing up at the door and back at her watch.  
The time was passing quickly, the time for the rendezvous was passed, 
and two of the most punctual among them were late.  &quot;Where are 
Haruka-san and Michiru-san?&quot;
 
&quot;Osoi, ne,&quot; Rei sighed.  Glancing at the Senshi of Love, Mars grinned, a 
sudden image flashing into her mind.  &quot;Maybe they got distracted.&quot;
 
The women, all about twenty-two, laughed, and even Setsuna covered her 
mouth to hide her mirth.  Mamoru groaned slightly at the light in his 
fianc&eacute;e&#39;s eyes and looked outside, pretending not to notice the turn of 
the conversation.  He sat up straighter, the motion silencing the Senshi 
gathered in the booth, as a familiar yellow&#151;gold, the owner 
insisted&#151;convertible pulled up outside the parlor.  Haruka and Michiru 
stepped out, the latter smiling a little more than her cheerful usual, 
and the former wearing an uncharacteristic half-smile on her lips.  
Michiru&#39;s head was resting on Haruka&#39;s shoulder, and the taller woman 
had an arm wrapped securely around her girlfriend&#39;s waist.
 
Mamoru let out a low whistle, a sentiment echoed by the women sitting 
with him.  &quot;Wow,&quot; Usagi whispered, blue eyes wide.  &quot;They&#39;ve never been 
so . . . demonstrative in public before.&quot;
 
Ami grinned, more at Usagi&#39;s correct use of a rather large and 
complicated word than at the beautiful couple.  &quot;Something must have 
happened at that diner.&quot;
 
Setsuna&#39;s red eyes shone as a smile spread across her face.  Hotaru 
looked at the taller of her mothers, and excitement spread through her 
thin frame.  She knew that something very important had happened and 
that her life would change somehow.  She couldn&#39;t wait to find out how.
 
Haruka and Michiru entered the parlor, eyes widening as they were 
surrounded by five women almost out of their respective colleges and 
their little purple-eyed daughter, all demanding an explanation at once.  
They finally sat down, and a shared tension and anticipation spread 
through the small group, silence infecting their small corner of the 
Crown Parlor as four pairs of blue eyes, one pair of green eyes, one 
pair of red eyes, one pair of dark purple eyes, and one pair of 
purple-grey eyes watched the new arrivals.  Haruka glanced down at 
Michiru, indicating that the secret was hers to tell.
 
Slowly, enjoying the moment of suspense, Michiru released Haruka&#39;s arm 
and held out her left hand.  Seven pairs of eyes widened, and Setsuna 
closed hers, smiling her mysterious secret smile.  &quot;Just like the old 
days.&quot;
 
Then the girls exploded, demanding explanations and a description of 
exactly what happened and how.  Haruka and Michiru sat down, and Michiru 
looked at Usagi as the blonde took her hand, examining the tiny flower.  
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; the young princess whispered, her own pink heart 
engagement ring sparkling from her left ring finger.  She and Mamoru had 
been engaged since she started high school, before they even knew about 
Galaxia, but they had decided not to get married until both had started 
their careers after college.  The Moon Princess could barely wait.
 
&quot;But where will you get married?&quot;
 
Everyone turned to the pair at Minako&#39;s question, and Haruka shrugged.  
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Minako-chan.  We haven&#39;t discussed that yet.&quot;
 
&quot;What about my shrine?&quot;
 
The miko smiled as all eyes turned to her, shrugging slightly.  &quot;Well, I 
would like it.  You could have any kind or combination of wedding 
ceremony you want because all the government really cares about is that 
piece of paper, ne?&quot;
 
Haruka decided to let Michiru choose, smiling when the aqua-haired woman 
nodded.  Hikawa Shrine, then.  Usagi smiled, frowning when her stomach 
let off the most amazing growling sound.  &quot;Oh, I am so hungry.&quot;
 
&quot;What do you mean, &#39;you&#39;re hungry&#39;?&quot; Haruka demanded, a smile playing at 
the corners of her mouth.  &quot;This is one of the most important days of my 
life and all you can think about is your stomach?&quot;
 
Rei laughed.  &quot;Eight years later, and you haven&#39;t changed at all, 
Usagi.&quot;  She smiled, the love everyone knew she felt for their leader in 
her eyes, and the senshi laughed.  Surrendering to the inevitable, the 
women and Mamoru ordered supper, putting off the wedding talk until it 
could be heard above certain loud stomachs.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;I never expected it.&quot;
 
Ami laughed.  &quot;Neither did I.  They&#39;ve been together for longer than 
we&#39;ve known them, but they never mentioned marriage or the future 
together.&quot;  She looked up at Makoto, blue eyes sparkling.  &quot;I wonder who 
they&#39;ll choose for maid of honor.&quot;
 
&quot;Usagi-chan, of course.  She is our princess and we all love her dearly.  
Of course they&#39;ll want her.&quot;
 
&quot;Really, Mako-chan?  Not Setsuna-san?&quot;
 
The brunette shook her head.  &quot;I don&#39;t think so.  She may be a Senshi 
and she may live with them, but there&#39;s very little any of us know about 
her.  After all, she still remembers the Silver Millennium because she 
was there.  She was never reborn, and we were.  I think she lost 
something, not dying, especially whatever connection she had with us in 
our past lives.  She could be father of the bride, though, since I&#39;m 
sure she knew Michiru-san&#39;s.&quot;  Both women laughed, imagining the tall 
green-haired senshi in a suit, walking Michiru down the aisle.  &quot;I 
wonder what I&#39;ll wear.&quot;
 
Ami glanced up at Makoto, her arms crossed in front of her as they 
approached the brunette&#39;s apartment.  &quot;What about that dress you wore to 
the dance at Mamoru-san&#39;s college when we were still in Junior High?&quot;  
She blushed slightly as she remembered the dance she had shared with the 
taller woman.
 
&quot;I&#39;d think that, after all these years, I could do better than that,&quot; 
Jupiter laughed as the two senshi stopped in front of her apartment.
 
&quot;I liked it.&quot;
 
Makoto locked eyes with her beautiful best friend at the soft comment, 
smiling slightly.  &quot;I&#39;m glad you, at least, did.  Thank you for walking 
me home, Ami-chan.  I enjoyed the company.&quot;
 
The blue-haired girl nodded, not trusting herself to look into Makoto&#39;s 
emerald eyes.  &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, Mako-chan.&quot;  Without glancing up 
at her friend, the older woman turned and headed for the elevator, 
almost running.  Makoto watched her leave, wondering why her best friend 
was suddenly so nervous.  Shrugging, Makoto entered her lonely 
apartment, tossing her jacket at the couch on the way to her closet.  
Opening her closet, Makoto pulled out the black dress with the huge rose 
on the front that she had worn to the dance years earlier.  She held it 
in front of her, looking at her reflection in the full-length mirror, 
frowning as she remembered how the dance had started.  No one had wanted 
to dance with her because she was so tall.
 
&quot;Then, will you dance with me?&quot;
 
Makoto&#39;s frown blossomed into a smile as she remembered following Ami 
onto the dance floor, remembering the feel of the smaller woman&#39;s hand 
in hers.  She could see the other guests moving to one side, giving her 
and Ami a place to dance, she could feel the slight woman&#39;s weight as 
she lifted her high above her head.  Dancing with Ami had felt so . . . 
right, and being with Ami made Makoto feel more complete than spending 
time with any of her boyfriends had.  Ami understood her so completely, 
accepted her no matter what, and never judged her.  They were friends, 
they were partners, and Ami would never, ever leave her.  The smaller 
woman was so kind and considerate, and Makoto knew that she would never 
have to hide anything from the Water Senshi, no matter how long they 
lived.
 
Makoto smiled at her reflection as the sun set, lost in thought.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Minako laughed as she raced Rei up the stairs of the Hikawa Shrine, 
letting the raven-haired miko win as her two crows watched them from the 
gate of the temple.  She pulled her opponent into a friendly embrace 
when they met at the top of the hill while both struggled to catch their 
breath.  &quot;Can you believe that Haruka-san and Michiru-san are getting 
married?&quot;
 
&quot;Finally,&quot; Rei added, knowing the blonde&#39;s thought as they walked toward 
the Hikawa Shrine.  &quot;I would think that you, of all people, would have 
figured it out, Minako-chan, Senshi of Love,&quot; the shrine maiden added.
 
Minako laughed as she bounced down the path beside Rei.  &quot;Honestly, 
Rei-chan, I was a little too preoccupied with my own love life to notice 
theirs.&quot;
 
Rei glanced at her companion, a wild sparkle in her purple-grey eyes.  
&quot;Ah, the goddess of love has someone?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, but that someone doesn&#39;t know yet.&quot;
 
Rei led Minako into her room, slipping out of her casual clothes and 
reaching for the white top and red skirt she wore around the shrine.  
She never noticed Minako&#39;s blue eyes avidly watching her every move, 
drinking in the sight of the beautiful half-dressed woman.  Minako had 
to keep herself from jumping the miko right then and there, regardless 
of decency or consequences.  &quot;Do I know this person?&quot;  Hino Rei 
straightened her incredibly long hair and turned around, unaware of the 
effect her movements were having on her companion.
 
Minako, shaking her head and swallowing, cleared her throat before she 
could answer.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what?  Strangely enough, whatever I was 
thinking of just went right out the window.&quot;  I was too busy staring at 
your gorgeous half-naked body to hear a word that came out of your 
mouth, Minako added in her mind. 
 
&quot;Do I know the person you have a crush on?&quot;  Rei didn&#39;t seem upset in 
the least to have to repeat the question.  She was used to it with 
Usagi.
 
&quot;You do.  But I haven&#39;t figured out how to make his person see my 
feelings and I really don&#39;t want to tell anyone until I can.&quot;
 
Rei grinned as she turned back to her friend.  She had grown so much and 
was no longer the reckless hothead she had been when she first met the 
people she shared a past and a destiny with.  She had become a much 
gentler person and more understanding of other people&#39;s feelings.  
Smiling kindly, she laid a gentle hand on the younger woman&#39;s cheek.  &quot;A 
person would have to be blind and stupid not to notice you, Minako.  You 
practically glow with love energy, and anyone would be honored to be 
allowed to love you.&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s the problem,&quot; the blonde whispered, tears in her eyes and 
voice that Rei could find no explanation for.  &quot;Maybe I have so much 
love energy that the people I really care about cannot see that my depth 
of feelings for them has changed since we met.  Or maybe that person 
can&#39;t imagine that I would ever look their way.&quot;
 
Rei suddenly realized how much her friend had changed over the years, 
and she forced herself to note the changes in the shorter woman.  She 
was vibrant, and Rei realized that she was very jealous of the person 
Minako had pledged her heart to.  For once, Rei wanted the gods to give 
her such a wonderful gift.  She wanted Minako, and she pulled her hand 
away as she thought how unfair that would be to Venus.  &quot;Um, when were 
you planning on leaving?  You could stay until Grandpa gets home and 
makes supper; I have a few chores to do, if you&#39;d like to help.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Minako whispered, struggling to keep her heart out of her 
voice.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Rei knelt in front of the sacred fire, her prayers ringing in her ears.  
She opened herself to the flames, letting them fill her, complete her, 
listening for their answer or a vision of the future.  She was also 
quite desperate to drive Minako from her mind, determined that she would 
not think about the gorgeous Love Senshi like that.  Her friend was only 
interested in men, and that was all she ever thought about.  It wasn&#39;t 
fair for Rei to tell Minako how she felt about her; the blonde deserved 
a normal life, and the miko could never give her one.  &quot;So stop thinking 
about her,&quot; Rei growled softly.
 
Rei&#39;s eyes shot open as an image appeared in the flames.  She spun at 
the sound of Minako entering the room, and both froze.  The look in 
Rei&#39;s eyes was incredibly powerful, and Minako took a step back, a 
little frightened.  &quot;Rei?&quot;  No honorific at all.  Rei knew that what she 
had seen was the truth.
 
&quot;Mi-na-ko,&quot; the miko managed to choke out, the image from the flame 
flashing through her mind.  &quot;Minako.&quot;
 
And suddenly Minako knew exactly what Rei had seen in the flames.  
Minako&#39;s secret love was revealed, and Minako took an involuntary step 
backward, unable to form comprehensible words.  Rei pounced, somehow 
managing to leave her kneeling position on the floor and grab Minako&#39;s 
arm, long fingers wrapping around the blonde&#39;s wrist as she pulled the 
senshi into her arms, staring into those startled blue eyes.  &quot;Why 
didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;
 
&quot;Rei,&quot; Minako whispered, eyes wide, her entire body trembling.  The miko 
loosened her hold for just a moment, and, a golden flash later, Sailor 
Venus sprang away.  Rei watched her leave, hands clasped to her heart, 
tears streaking her cheeks.
 
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;</pre>
