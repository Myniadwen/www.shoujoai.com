<h1>Venus Needs Women!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Now,&quot; Princess Minako gestured dramatically, her
golden cape swirling around the blonde&#39;s slim body,
&quot;it&#39;s time to conquer this planet...&quot; There was a long
moment&#39;s pause, and everyone on the bridge waited for
it.

&quot;Earth, ma&#39;am,&quot; Rei finally prompted her princess and
commander with a sigh, her expression one of long
suffering patience.

Minako recovered quickly, &quot;Earth, yes!&quot; She looked out
the viewscreen, &quot;This planet is rich in resources, and
most importantly...&quot;


&quot;...Venus Needs Women!&quot; A Hotaru and Minako adventure.



&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; Hotaru Tomoe blinked, the black
haired woman looking at the monitors with a deadpan
expression. Dressed in her reservist uniform the Major
stood with her unit on a bridge into Tokyo, watching
things get progressively crazier.

Descending from space were hundreds of flying saucers,
literally. Round disks with blinky lights mounted on
the top and bottom they cruised down gracefully
towards the surface, casually avoiding aircraft and
other obstacles. They swept in to military bases and
ray guns blasted out, crippling and destroying weapons
and vehicles. Oddly there had been no casualties so
far, just damage to the military infrastructure.

Ami Mizuno sat perched in her tank, the blue haired
woman tense but ready to act. &quot;And no one&#39;s attempted
communication with them?&quot; she asked, pushing up her
glasses.

&quot;They did,&quot; Mamoru Chiba said, the black haired marine
holding his gun at the ready, &quot;but there was no
reply.&quot;

&quot;Who knows if they even speak English?&quot; Haruka Tenoh
pointed out dryly, the other marine looking tough and
capable. The sandy blonde looked towards Hotaru and
asked, &quot;Any word if a saucer is heading here?&quot;

&quot;One&#39;s on course for here,&quot; Hotaru admitted, &quot;but it
could turn.&quot;

&quot;Incoming,&quot; Usagi Tsukino gulped, the pretty blonde
police officer standing nervously nearby. Almost
everyone who could fight had been mobilized for the
defense of the city, and with so many routes to cover
they called in emergency services, too.

The saucer smoothly descended through the clouds,
hovering above the ground, then it deployed landing
struts. It came to Earth with a soft thud, the hull of
the vehicle folding down to become a access ramp of
some kind.

&quot;Get a video feed to command,&quot; Hotaru ordered crisply,
&quot;if they&#39;re actually coming out of one of their ships
it could be invaluable data.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, I&#39;ll...&quot; Ami started only to trail off,
blinking in surprise as the Flying Saucer&#39;s
inhabitants spilled out.

They were all women... if fact, they were gorgeous
women of all styles and colors. Dressed in scanty
bikini&#39;s and bottoms, boots and gloves they made more
than one man in the formation do a double take, not to
mention a few women too.

&quot;There is a god,&quot; Haruka whistled softly.

Whack! Michiru Kaoru, army nurse, calmly whacked her
lover on the back of the head, then the green haired
woman stalked back to her nursing post.

&quot;Eyes front, people,&quot; Hotaru commanded, &quot;we don&#39;t know
what to expect.&quot;

&quot;Take your pick, everyone,&quot; Minako cheered, &quot;just
don&#39;t be too greedy!&quot;

&quot;What in the...&quot; Mamoru started before a black haired
alien woman slapped him aside with a casual ease.

Rei smiled as she bodily picked up the squealing
Usagi. &quot;I think I&#39;ll take this one,&quot; she purred as she
took her struggling captive back to the ship.

&quot;Wait a minute, you,&quot; Haruka started before a tall,
black haired woman eyed her up and down thoughtfully.

&quot;You look most charming,&quot; Setsuna purred, the greenish
tint in her hair shining in the sun as she stalked
towards Haruka.

&quot;Don&#39;t you even think about it,&quot; Michiru quickly
popped up to protest, grabbing hold of Haruka&#39;s arm
possessively.

Ignoring that comment, Setsuna grabbed them both. &quot;I
don&#39;t think that Mina will mind if I take two,&quot; she
chuckled, carrying them off.

&quot;Oh boy,&quot; Ami squeaked out as she tried to close the
hatch of her tank, tugging hard only to realize that
it was stuck. She looked up only to gulp, meeting the
beautiful green eyes of a brown haired amazon who held
the hatch open casually.

Makoto pulled Ami out of the tank with surprising
gentleness as she murmured, &quot;I can&#39;t believe someone
hasn&#39;t claimed one as pretty as you.&quot;

Ami blushed.

Hotaru managed to get her gun up as the band of alien
women swept through her command, bodily taking the
girls away. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t try that,&quot; the blonde woman
who seemed to be the leader warned, &quot;I am Princess
Minako, a fully trained Venusian warrior.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve taken my people,&quot; Hotaru kept her gun leveled
at her as she ordered coldly, &quot;give them back, now.&quot;

Minako raised a eyebrow in surprise at the clear
defiance, studying the young woman in military dress
who was standing before her. Focusing on the name on
her uniform Minako asked, &quot;Tomoe... is that a first or
last name?&quot;

&quot;Last,&quot; Hotaru said flatly, &quot;my name is Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;Hotaru, you have spunk,&quot; Minako said as she hefted
what looked like a saber, &quot;I like that. I think I&#39;ll
keep you.&quot;

&quot;Like hell,&quot; and Hotaru fired.

Minako dodged so fast it was like she disappeared,
then she swept forward with her blade. Surprisingly
Hotaru parried the attack with the muzzle of her gun,
kicking out to drive her backward. Gracefully they
fought as they heard explosions off in the distance,
probably human defense positions firing old style
cannons.

&quot;I suppose you wouldn&#39;t surrender?&quot; Minako asked her
cheerfully, eyes twinkling as she twirled the chain
thoughtfully.

Hotaru felt herself smiling back a little, unable to
resist her good naturedness. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Hotaru cast her
damaged pistol aside and pulled a knife, &quot;can&#39;t do
that.&quot; They came together in a flash of silver, blades
ringing, then Hotaru tried a stunt her old drill
master had taught her, using the flat of her knife and
a twist of her wrist to get Minako&#39;s weapon away from
her.

Minako looked at her bare hand in shock, &quot;It&#39;s not
possible...&quot;

Hotaru was about to answer when there was a whistle of
noise and a sudden explosion. Something heavy hammered
her from behind and Hotaru fell forward, feeling
Minako grab her protectively as the world went dark.

Some unknown amount of time passed and Hotaru&#39;s sleep
was disturbed by quiet voices. &quot;Yes, prime minister,&quot;
Minako&#39;s voice said calmly, &quot;we&#39;ll return anyone who
wishes to go back, but it appears that quite a few
women have chosen to remain.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; the man answered her grimly, &quot;and I hope
there&#39;ll be no further misunderstandings between our
people.&quot;

&quot;My warriors were rather eager looking for their new
brides,&quot; Minako said a bit apologetically, &quot;farewell,
sir.&quot;

A moment later a new female voice said, &quot;I&#39;ve finished
the post-regeneration check, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Will she recover?&quot; Minako asked grimly.

&quot;The blow broke her back,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice answered,
&quot;a mild injury by our standards. She should awaken any
time, m&#39;lady.&quot;

Hotaru opened her eyes a crack, blinking in the light
of a finely decorated chamber. &quot;You&#39;re awake,&quot; Minako
said, hurrying to Hotaru&#39;s side.

Hotaru sat up with a groan, meeting eyes that
positively glowed with concern. &quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; she
felt relief, having heard the description of her
injuries with a chill in her heart.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad,&quot; Minako murmured, holding Hotaru&#39;s hands
possessively.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Hotaru asked, faintly surprised at
the warmth she felt building within her from her
hands.

&quot;The war is over, warrior,&quot; Minako said calmly, &quot;in
part thanks to you, beautiful one.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Hotaru looked at her in confusion.

&quot;You, a representative of Earth defeated me, a
representative of Venus in single combat,&quot; Minako
explained, &quot;you won the war for your people, and have
also won the spoils of war.&quot;

&quot;The spoils of war?&quot; Hotaru blinked.

&quot;By the laws of my people,&quot; Minako threw her arms
around the startled Hotaru, &quot;I am now your bride!&quot;

To be continued...?

Authors notes: I blame this on seeing Mars Attacks and
the occasional B-movie, as well as the spoof Amazon
Women on the Moon. Oddly, the idea of Minako leading a
army of amazons attacking Earth didn&#39;t seem like such
a stretch. There MAY be a part two, but don&#39;t hold
your breath.</pre>
