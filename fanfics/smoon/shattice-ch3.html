<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 3 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>        Ami pulled the small car up outside the Outers&#39; home and took 
a deep, steadying breath. &#39;I can do this,&#39; she thought to herself 
seriously.

        &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Ami?&quot; Chibi-Usa looked up at her innocently.

        Ami smiled down at the pink haired little girl, &quot;I think I&#39;m 
going to come inside with you today, is that all right?&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;ll make Hotaru happy,&quot; Chibi-Usa beamed.

        Ami got out first, them went around to open up Chibi-Usa&#39;s 
door. She took the little girl&#39;s hand in hers and proceeded to walk up 
the sidewalk to the front door. They reached the front door, and Ami 
had to fight back a smile as the curtains ruffled. &#39;Guess someone was 
watching for us,&#39; she thought as she reached for the bell.

        *Ding dong!* the doorbell rang.

        It took a few moments for it to be answered, and Ami could 
hear a whispered conversation going on just inside. The blue haired 
young woman looked down at Chibi-Usa, who just shrugged slightly. Ami 
felt nervous as the front door opened and Setsuna smiled slightly, 
&quot;Hello, Ms. Mizuno. It&#39;s nice to see you again.&quot;

        &quot;Call me Ami,&quot; she smiled back at the elegant black haired 
woman. She hesitated before offering, &quot;Chibi-Usa tells me that Hotaru 
mentioned that it might be nice if I visited sometime. So I thought 
I&#39;d take you up on it.&quot;

        Setsuna stepped aside to let her in, &quot;We&#39;re glad to have you.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you, Ms. Meiou &quot; Ami followed her in.

        Setsuna smiled gently at the grave young woman, &quot;I don&#39;t think 
anyone would object to the using of their first names.&quot;

        Before Ami could say anything, Hotaru, Haruka and Michiru came 
into the living room together. &quot;Chibi-Usa,&quot; she beamed, running to the 
pink haired girl&#39;s side. The taller dark haired girl hugged the 
smaller pink one, then looked up at Ami with a slight smile, &quot;Hello 
Ami.&quot;

        &quot;Hello, Hotaru,&quot; Ami bent slightly to return her smile. It 
gave her a moment to collect herself, trying to deal with the 
unexpected smiles on the other two Outers&#39; faces. &#39;I thought they&#39;d be 
angry,&#39; she mused, &#39;especially Haruka.&#39;

        &quot;Ami,&quot; Michiru smiled at her happily, &quot;welcome to our home.&quot;

        &quot;Hey,&quot; Haruka gave her a tentative smile, and the echoes of 
their last big fight hung in the air between them. One wrong word, a 
single angry gesture, and the fragile peace would be broken.

        Ami firmly set those words behind her as she smiled at 
Michiru, &quot;I&#39;m glad I was invited.&quot; She offered her hand to Haruka, 
&quot;Nice to see you, again.&quot;

        Haruka took that offered hand, shaking it firmly. &quot;Let&#39;s get 
you sat down,&quot; the sandy haired, boyish woman smiled as Chibi-Usa 
dragged Hotaru off so that they could go play together.

        Setsuna felt a surge of relief at how well things were going. 
She paused in the kitchen doorway, &quot;I&#39;ll go make some tea.&quot;

        Ami smoothly took a seat on one of the couches, her eyes 
widening just slightly as the two other women snuggled together on the 
other couch, Haruka gentlemanly enfolding Michiru in the curve of her 
arm. Before now she had thought they might be a couple from how they 
worked together, but this seemed to confirm it.

        Michiru smiled at her gently and broke the silence, &quot;I 
understand you&#39;re taking advanced courses at the university?&quot;

        &quot;In medicine, yes,&quot; Ami nodded. &#39;Talking about school, that I 
can handle,&#39; she thought in relief. &quot;I understand you&#39;re on a music 
scholarship, right?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, I&#39;m studying the violin,&quot; Michiru smiled.

        &quot;And her paintings are all over the campus,&quot; Haruka said 
proudly.

        &quot;I&#39;ve seen a few,&quot; Ami agreed. &quot;I heard you perform once with 
Haruka playing the piano,&quot; she mused softly after a moment, &quot;I thought 
it was beautiful.&quot;

        That seemed to startle both women, somehow. &quot;Thank you,&quot; 
Haruka managed. She hesitated, then looking down at the fine carpet 
she softly said, &quot;I wanted to apologize, Ami.&quot;

        Ami looked up to meet eyes that were earnestly looking at her. 
&#39;It can&#39;t have been easy for her to say that,&#39; Ami mused. &quot;Considering 
some of the things that I said to Setsuna,&quot; Ami smiled at her wryly, 
&quot;it&#39;s understandable.&quot;

        Setsuna came in carrying the tea pot, setting it down on the 
coffee table and pouring out four cups. &quot;What&#39;s understandable?&quot; she 
asked.

        Ami took a breath. One of the reasons she had avoided coming 
here for so long was because she knew she would have to do this. She 
looked up at the seemingly serene Setsuna, &quot;I wanted to say how sorry 
I am for what I said to you.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s not necessary,&quot; Setsuna said quietly.

        Michiru chuckled softly and the others looked up at her in 
surprise. &quot;Haruka&#39;s trying to apologize to Ami, Ami wants to say sorry 
to Setsuna, and I&#39;m sure that she and I have things we&#39;re both sorry 
for, too,&quot; she shrugged.

        Ami&#39;s lips quirked just slightly, &quot;It is mildly absurd, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

        Setsuna looked at both Ami and Haruka, and for a moment was 
struck by how similar they were in some ways. Strength, intensity, 
pride, they both had that. &#39;I wonder, was Ami like this before?&#39; she 
thought sadly.

        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Haruka asked softly.

        &quot;We move on,&quot; Setsuna said simply. She looked at the others, 
&quot;We put the past behind us, forgive each other for what happened, and 
start over.&quot;

        Ami picked up her cup of tea, swirling it around a bit before 
she took a drink. It was perfect. &quot;All right,&quot; she said firmly, &quot;we 
move forward from now, as senshi.&quot;

        Setsuna was a bit surprised to hear herself say, &quot;And as 
friends?&quot;

        Ami&#39;s face paled slightly, her scar darkening to a fierce red 
as she took a unsteady breath. After a moment she smiled weakly and 
quietly offered, &quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;

        Michiru was giving Setsuna the oddest look, and Ami wasn&#39;t 
quite sure what to make of it. Then the green haired girl smiled at 
her, &quot;I just have one question.&quot;

        Ami blinked, &quot;Yes?&quot;

        Michiru offered this to all present, &quot;Who will be our leader?&quot;

        There was a very long silence when a voice said clearly, 
&quot;Sailor Mercury.&quot; The four looked up to see Hotaru and Chibi-Usa 
standing there in the doorway. It was Hotaru who had spoken, looking 
at them with a maturity far beyond her years.

        &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Ami started to say.

        Haruka didn&#39;t hesitate when she said, &quot;I agree, Mercury should 
lead the senshi.&quot; At Ami&#39;s surprised glance she smiled slightly, 
&quot;Despite my making an ass of myself, Ami handled herself with strength 
and maturity. And probably saved us all.&quot;

        &quot;Exactly,&quot; Hotaru said as she and Chibi-Usa took seats nearby.

        &quot;I am not ready for this,&quot; Ami said firmly.

        &quot;Were any of us ready when we gained our powers?&#39; Chibi-Usa 
offered up surprisingly. &quot;We learn as we go, and pick ourselves up 
after our mistakes,&quot; she finished.

        &quot;From the mouths of babes,&quot; Michiru murmured. She gave Ami a 
gentle smile, &quot;From what I&#39;ve seen of you, I&#39;d tend to agree.&quot;

        Ami had a almost panicked look on her face as she looked over 
at Setsuna, &quot;Are you going to make it unanimous?&quot;

        Setsuna gave the boyish blue haired young woman a gentle 
smile, &quot;I would tend to agree, yes, but I won&#39;t press you. If you 
truly do not feel ready for this, one of the others will fill the 
role.&quot;

        Ami puffed out a breath, feeling their eyes on her. 
Chibi-Usa&#39;s trusting, Hotaru&#39;s piercing, Haruka&#39;s confident, Michiru 
clearly sympathetic and Setsuna&#39;s... She looked at her with an 
unreadable expression, leaving Ami wondering what was going on behind 
those eyes.

        &quot;All right,&quot; Ami said reluctantly, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;
