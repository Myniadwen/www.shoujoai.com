Darien and Serena&#39;s mother ran down  the halls of the slayer&#39;s hide out 
as fast as they could. Other slayers were following in their lead, 
trying to get to the battle as fast as possible, not wanting to miss any 
action. When they reached their destination, they all stopped in shock. 
Vampires were everywhere. Thousands of them fighting, beating the crap 
out of the slayers badly.

Darien growled deep within his throat, turning to Serena&#39;s mother, 
&quot;Leah, lead them into the battle!,&quot;

Leah looked at the man skeptically, not understanding why the man didn&#39;t 
want to lead his own people into battle, then turning to the slayers 
that were huddled up behind her, she shouted, &quot;Come on guys! You heard 
the man, lets move!,&quot; 

The slayers shouted with battle cries, running after Leah to get into 
the fight. Darien watched silently, as his people ran off, crossing his 
arms over his chest. He suddenly turned, leaving the battle scene behind 
him.

*********

Serena leaned against the wall, still in the training room. Her deadly 
piercing silver eyes were glued onto the poor man that was left to watch 
her. She watched as a trickle of sweat rolled down his flushed face, as 
he shifted uncomfortably.  She smirked loving the way he squirmed 
underneath her intense gaze.

The man looked everywhere except on Serena. He didn&#39;t want to look at 
that kid, she was scary and wanted to leave as soon as possible. He 
could feel her eyes on him, making him feel fear bubbling in the pit of 
his stomach. He knew that she was toying with him, ideas forming in her 
young mind. Ideas he didn&#39;t want to know or even think about.

He finally got enough courage to turn his head towards her and let out a 
startled yelp, seeing that Serena was standing right in front of him, 
about a foot in distance between them. She had a sly smirk on her face, 
looking at him, eyes twinkling with amusement. He shuddered seeing the 
look in her eyes. He took a surprised step back, his back pressed 
against the wall.

Serena took a step closer to him, her smirk deepening, &quot;You know, you 
can just let me go,&quot;

The man looked down at her, fear evident in his eyes, &quot;I-I c-cant. 
D-Darien say that y-you have to s-stay here,&quot;

Serena smiled at his stuttering. &quot;Well then, that&#39;s a problem,&quot;

She growled, fangs becoming exposed, sharp and white. She shot out her 
hand, grabbing him by the collar of his shirt, yanking him closer to 
her. She brought her face to his neck, piercing her fangs into his 
flesh.  All that could be heard was an blood curdling scream, before it 
soon  died out.

Serena smirked, whipping her mouth with the back of her hand, dropping 
the man to the floor . She looked at him. He was breathing heavily, 
falling to unconsciousness. She hadn&#39;t taken enough blood to kill him, 
but surely enough to keep him down for a while. She stepped back and 
went towards the door.

She turned the door knob, opening the door and walked outside. The halls 
were completely empty, just as she had hoped. She could hear screams, 
and weapons clinking together, coming from down the hall. She looked 
around one more time, before she took off towards the battle.

*********

Mina screamed, being pushed from behind and was thrown to the ground. 
She landed on her stomach and quickly flipped over to see, Malcolm 
running towards. She quickly turned to her side, when the man slammed 
his fist down, missing his target and hitting the floor.

She swiped his feet from underneath him, watching as he collided to the 
floor. She  quickly jumped to her feet, turning quickly to see that he 
was still getting to his feet, gaining his composure. Mina growled and 
charged forward, ramming into his open back.

They both flew forward, Malcolm running into the wall, grunting when 
Mina pushed him in harder. She turned her head to the side, seeing Amy 
and Molly. Molly had Zack on the floor, arms pinned behind him cheering 
Amy on to hit him harder.

Amy had her fist raised, ramming them into Zack&#39;s face repeatedly. 
Grunts of pain where the only thing the poor man could muster up. Lita 
was on the other side of the room, in hand to hand combat with Nate. 
Dodging each other&#39;s blows barely. Rapid kicks and punches thrown at 
each other.

Rini sat on some Slayer&#39;s back, giggling and cheering for Hotaru to slam 
the man&#39;s head down harder. Hotaru held the guy by his hair, and was 
slamming his head down to the floor and was laughing along with her 
girlfriend, finding it hilarious to hear the man&#39;s head make such  loud 
banging noises.

Melvin and Diana was also beating the crap out of a Slayer. Melvin was 
sitting on the man&#39;s stomach, holding his legs open. He burst out in 
laughter as Diana kicked the man in the balls, probably for the 
thirtieth time in the past 10 minutes.

Serena ran into the room where the fight was being held and her eyes 
widened in astonishment. There were so many vampires and slayers, 
fighting to the death. She stood there for a moment watching the fights 
and couldn&#39;t help but giggle at seeing her friends totally kicking the 
crap put of the slayers. 

Her eyes scanned the room, looking for her lover. She grinned, seeing 
Rei back slap some slayer and watched as he flew across the room and hit 
a wall. Serena ran towards her, gabbing her from behind and twirled her 
around in circles a few times.

Rei squealed in surprise, eyes widening. Serena set her down, and turned 
her by the shoulders, enveloping  her lover&#39;s soft pouting lips. Serena 
pulled back and grinned. Rei looked misty-eyes for a moment, before she 
shook her head. 

She looked up into Serena&#39;s eyes, not believing that her lover was 
really standing before her, &quot;Serena?,&quot;

She nodded her head, &quot;Yea Rei, it&#39;s me.&quot;

Rei smiled wrapping her arms around Serena tightly, then whispered, &quot;I 
thought I&#39;d never see you again,&quot;

Serena smiled, holding Rei closer to her. She raised her head up a bit 
and looked at Amara and Michelle. Her eyes narrowed a bit looking at the 
duo fight, she then looked down, breathing in Rei&#39;s hair. Her head shot 
up hearing Michelle&#39;s scream.

Her eyes widened in shock, seeing that her own mother had shoved a stake 
in to Michelle&#39;s heart. She watched as the woman slowly turned into 
dust.  After that everything else seemed to go in slow motion. Her eyes 
slowly turned to Amara, seeing the horrified expression on her face.

Amara ran towards Leah, jumping on the woman from behind. She took her 
hands, putting one on Leah&#39;s jaw, and another somewhere on the side of 
her head. She quickly moved them, snapping the woman&#39;s neck. Leah let 
out a grunt before her entire body went limp. The body dropped to the 
floor with a soft thud.

Amara crawled her way over to the stack of dust that was her lover. She 
reached out her hands, picking up the pile. A few tears escaped her 
eyes, trailing down her face, whispering Michelle&#39;s name over and over.

Serena had tears of her own coursing down her face. She couldn&#39;t believe 
it, she had just lost Michelle. Rei felt Serena&#39;s body start to shake 
and pushed her back a bit. Her eyes held a look of concern, seeing the 
tears in her lover&#39;s eyes.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Serena?,&quot; she asked, wiping the tears away. Serena didn&#39;t 
respond and just kept her eyes on Amara and the patch of dust that was 
left of Michelle. Rei turned her head  to where Serena&#39;s eyes were drawn 
to, and her eyes widened in shock.

&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she whispered, not believing  what had just happened. Her 
eyes turned a little to the left and saw Andrew coming up behind the 
woman.

&quot;Amara-papa watch out!,&quot; shouted Rei.  Amara looked towards Rei then 
turned around to feel a stake being shoved into her chest, piercing her 
heart. She gasped, feeling the horrible pain.  She spit up blood, some 
running down her chin.

She looked down at her body, seeing that it was deteriorating.  She 
looked up, seeing Andrew grinning, succeeding in striking his target.  
He spit on her face.

&quot;I hope you&#39;ll like rotting in hell!,&quot; he shouted, before he was knocked 
down from behind. Jet and Tray jumped on Andrew, beating the man into a 
bloody pulp. Serena ran towards the woman, grabbing onto her hand. The 
bottom portion of her body was already gone.

&quot;Amara-papa, you cant die,&quot; whispered Serena.

The woman smiled, &quot;Take care of Rei ok?,&quot;

Serena nodded her head, &quot;Yea I promise,&quot;

That was the last thing Amara heard before her whole body turned into 
dust. Serena stared at the hand that broke down in to a pile of dark 
gray dust in front of her. Serena sat there, breathing ragged, tears 
falling freely down her face. 

She gripped the dust into her hands, clenching her hands into fist. The 
pain in her heart was throbbing in her chest. It felt like she couldn&#39;t 
breathe, she placed her hands on the floor, putting her head down. She 
started to breath heavily, chest heaving.

Rei looked at her girlfriend and gasped, it was happening again. She was 
getting angry and that wasn&#39;t a good thing. She ran over to Serena, 
kneeling down next to her. She pulled Serena into her arms holding her 
tightly.

&quot;Serena calm down,&quot; whispered Rei pleadingly. The fighting stopped, 
everyone surrounding Serena and Rei, watching them intently. Serena&#39;s 
body started to tremble, more violently by the passing minute. Anger was 
bubbling insider her, making her loose control inch by inch, second 
after second.

&quot;Please Serena!, keep control!,&quot; exclaimed Rei, holding her tighter to 
her. Serena was beyond hearing what Rei was saying?Her mind was clouded 
with Amara and Michelle dying?The memory playing over and over again. 
The memory of her father&#39;s death, the memory of finding out the truth of 
her mother?It was just too much for her to handle.

She pushed herself away from Rei, sweat dripping down her face. She 
covered her head with her arms, mumbling something incoherent. Rei moved 
closer to her, placing her hand on Serena&#39;s shoulder. Serena growled, 
slapping the girl&#39;s hand away from.

&quot;Get away from me! Don&#39;t touch me!,&quot; she shouted. Rei moved away from 
her slightly, surprised.

&quot;Serena,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Leave me alone!,&quot; she growled. She rolled over onto her back holding 
her head, rocking from side to side. She could hear voices in her head. 
Her mother&#39;s cries, telling her and her brother to run, Michelle&#39;s 
scream, Amara last plea, telling her to take care of Rei.

Finally the cord snapped, all control was lost?Serena was pissed and no 
one was going to stop her from seeking her revenge. The revenge? The one 
thing she&#39;s been saying since she was a child, and that was to kill 
Darien.
