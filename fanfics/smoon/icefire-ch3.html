<h1>Ice on Fire (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/icefire-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The lights were dim in the cozy living room, only illuminated by a 
lamp standing by the couch. Two figures cuddle there, as soft music 
played in the background. Suddenly, Haruka jerked back from kissing 
Michiru, disturbed by frantic knocking on the door. She angrily 
stalked over, whipped the door open, and saw a very dazed looking Ami 
stood there. &quot;I, Rei and I, we&#39;re going on a date, I don&#39;t know what 
to do, or dress or...&quot; Ami rambled on.

Haruka sighed and led the shaken girl in, bringing up the lights as 
she went. &quot;Michiru, could you make one of your specials?&quot; Haruka asked 
as she sat Ami down on the couch.

A very amused Michiru said &quot;I&#39;ll make it a double.&quot;, and walked over 
to the bar. After a bit of measuring, pouring and mixing, Michiru 
brought over an oddly colored drink. &quot;Drink it all down,&quot; Michiru 
encouraged Ami with a smile.

Ami looked at the drink dubiously, then drank. It went down smooth, 
but then her eyes widened, she broke out in a cold sweat and wheezed 
loudly for a minute or so. Haruka nodded, satisfied. &quot;Now that the 
medicine has set in, tell us what&#39;s wrong.&quot;

&quot;After you left,&quot; Ami croaked out, &quot;Rei and I got to talking. She 
wants to go out on a date with me!&quot;

&quot;Has she said how she feels about you?&quot; Michiru asked, jumping in 
worriedly.

&quot;She&#39;s not sure,&quot; Ami quietly admitted in a more normal tone of voice. 
Haruka violently rolled her eyes, getting a glare from Michiru. 
&quot;What?&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;Watch your heart, my friend,&quot; Haruka said simply. &quot;Ask around the bar 
sometime, and you&#39;ll learn that experimenting straight girls are the 
worst.&quot;

&quot;So you think she&#39;s just playing?&quot; Ami asked. Haruka shrugged. Ami 
turned to Michiru, who smiled warmly.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Michiru said. &quot;Rei&#39;s not that sort of person. But 
she may hurt you without intending to.&quot; she added.

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Haruka asked, &quot;you said you&#39;re going on a date? When? 
Where?&quot;

&quot;Tonight, and I told her I&#39;m taking her to The Rose.&quot; Ami answered 
worriedly.

Haruka nodded like an approving father. &quot;Good pick. A high class 
place, but the girls on the staff won&#39;t throw you out if they catch 
two girls necking in the corner.&quot; Ami blushed at that. &quot;I&#39;ll lend you 
a suit,&quot; Haruka said smiling at her.

She and Michiru dragged her into the bedroom, and after a bit of 
fishing around, Haruka pulled out a crisp, ice blue suit. &quot;The color 
never suited me,&quot; Haruka commented as she held it up against Ami. 
After taking a few measurements, Haruka smiled satisfied. &quot;Come by 
about five, and we&#39;ll dress you up.&quot;

Michiru walked Ami to the door. &quot;I saw the price tag,&quot; Ami commented 
softly. &quot;It&#39;s new, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Ami asked. Michiru laughed quietly.

&quot;Do you think she&#39;d admit she bought you the suit ?&quot; Michiru 
commented. &quot;She&#39;s too butch for that.&quot; she said, amused.

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako lay on top her bed wearing a goofy smile and nothing else. 
&quot;Bones,&quot; she said, and sighed softly. The girl had only left an hour 
ago, explaining she had to get some sleep before her shift tonight. 
Minako was just thankful her parents hadn&#39;t quite put together the 
idea that two girls sleeping together in one bed could be bad idea.

She got up to the sound of a soft knocking, pulling on her shorts and 
a T-shirt. She smiled happily as she opened the door and saw Rei. &quot;So 
how was your night?&quot; Minako asked teasingly.

Rei rolled her eyes. &quot;Not as good as yours, I see.&quot; Rei said dryly, 
looking over the sleepy figure and the rumpled bed.

&quot;Don&#39;t knock it until you&#39;ve tried the door, I always say.&quot; Minako 
answered cheerfully. Rei groaned softly.

&quot;That didn&#39;t even make sense,&quot; she complained as the smiling Minako 
led her in. &quot;I need your help with something.&quot;

&quot;First you insult my quotes, now you want my help?&quot; Minako pouted 
cutely.

&quot;Hey, you owe me for giving your parents that fake excuse a month 
ago!&quot; Rei protested loudly. Minako got a dreamy look on her face, 
murmuring a young man&#39;s name. Rei sighed wearily. &quot;Anyway, I just need 
to borrow a dress.&quot; Rei said quietly.

&quot;Oh, ho!&quot; Minako said happily. &quot;You got asked out at the bar last 
night! Who&#39;s the lucky girl?&quot; Minako asked eagerly.

&quot;Ami, if you must know.&quot; Rei answered, and blushed brightly. Minako 
just grinned at her happily.

&quot;So what do you need?&quot; Minako asked her. Rei only shrugged helplessly. 
&quot;Is it formal dining, or informal?&quot; Minako elaborated.

&quot;Formal, I think?&quot; Rei made the answer a question. &quot;Ami said the 
restaurant was called The Rose.&quot; Rei finished.

&quot;That would be formal,&quot; Minako nodded, turned to her closet and began 
to search. &quot;Ah ha!&quot; she cried, and pulled out a sexy scarlet dress. 
&quot;Try it on.&quot; she urged Rei. Rei stripped off her pants and top under 
Minako&#39;s appreciative gaze, and slipped on the red dress. &quot;It brings 
out your eyes.&quot; Minako said, satisfied.

Rei looked in the mirror, and slowly smiled as she looked at the 
hourglass figure in sinful, slinky red that was reflected before her. 
&quot;I&#39;ll take it,&quot; Rei said.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ami waited by the shrine gate nervously, where she and Rei had 
arranged to meet. The crisply ironed blue suit fit her like a glove, 
hugging her curves and making it clear there was a woman inside. &#39;A 
woman,&#39; Ami thought. &#39;I wonder when I started to think of myself 
that way?&#39; Her train of thought was suddenly derailed as Rei 
gracefully walked into her line of sight. The red dress hugged Rei 
from just above her bust to just below her knees, but left very little 
to Ami&#39;s imagination.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Ami said quietly, feeling her pulse begin to race. She saw a 
flash of white as Rei gave her a satisfied smile. She stepped up 
beside Rei and offered her arm like a gentleman. &quot;It&#39;s times like this 
I&#39;m glad I&#39;m a Sailor Senshi,&quot; Ami said to Rei teasingly.

Rei raised her eyebrow as she took Ami&#39;s arm. &quot;Why is that?&quot; she asked 
innocently as they walked together down the shrine steps.

&quot;In that dress, I may have to fight off an army to have you to 
myself,&quot; a smiling Ami answered. Rei blushed, and smiled back at her.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei said quietly, and kissed Ami gently on the cheek.

A short cab ride later, Ami helped Rei out of the cab. She took her 
arm again and led her into the restaurant. It may have been a western 
style building, but Rei smiled a bit in relief as she saw the variety 
of dishes being served, as well as the size of the line to be seated. 
Ami confidently led her to the front of the line and smiled to the 
pretty hostess waiting there. Who, Rei noticed, with a surprising 
flare of jealousy, perked right up and smiled very warmly back.

&quot;Table for two, reserved under Mizuno,&quot; Ami said with a confident 
smile. The girl checked her book, nodded and led them to a secluded 
corner table. Lit by nearby lamps, it was shadowed enough for privacy. 
She passed them each a menu, filled two glasses of water, then paused 
a moment.

&quot;If you need anything,&quot; she said with special emphasis, smiling with a 
great deal of warmth at Ami, &quot;just call, OK?&quot; She smiled sweetly again 
and walked off.

Rei looked over to the slightly dumbfounded Ami and smiled, chuckled, 
then began to softly laugh. &quot;Did she just make a pass at you?&quot; a 
smiling Rei asked quietly.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Ami said, blushing. She busied herself with the menu a 
moment, trying to recover her composure.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Rei said gently, putting her hand on Ami&#39;s. &quot;When I 
saw you in that suit, I was more than a bit tempted myself.&quot; Rei 
blushed a bit at admitting that.

Ami laughed softly. &quot;Don&#39;t get me started on that dress. If I went 
with my first impulse, we wouldn&#39;t be here right now,&quot; she said with a 
smile.

They both shared a laugh, and Rei felt the tension she had been 
feeling fade a bit. She thought back a moment to when she had slowed 
her walk towards that handsome figure in blue waiting by the shrine 
gate. Her eyes had moved up the slim, tailored form until she saw 
Ami&#39;s slightly surprised face. Rei blushed a bit, realizing that at 
that moment she had wanted Ami, and if she was honest with herself, 
she had wanted her a lot.

They talked casually throughout the meal, but Ami and Rei found 
themselves more and more drawn into the other&#39;s intense gaze. Ami was 
charming and gentlemanly to Rei, and Rei found herself responding as 
if she was dating a handsome boy. But Rei hadn&#39;t ever dated a boy as 
kind and warm as Ami was. Their hands would brush occasionally across 
the small table, and each time Rei would feel her breath catch in her 
throat. I don&#39;t know if I can take this much longer, Rei thought.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Ami asked quietly, &quot;have you ever considered dating a girl 
before?&quot; Ami looked searchingly into Rei&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Does Haruka count?&quot; Rei asked with a grin. She and Ami shared a laugh 
at that. &quot;I&#39;ve had crushes before,&quot; Rei admitted, &quot;and it hasn&#39;t 
helped that my times with boys have mostly just fallen flat. Chad 
never felt like anything more than a friend to me, and Mamoru, well, I 
think I always knew that was doomed.&quot; Rei smiled a sad, wistful smile.

Ami put her hand comfortingly on Rei&#39;s. &quot;I never found that spark with 
a boy either,&quot; Ami said softly. &quot;So,&quot; she asked, smiling warmly, &quot;who 
was your crush?&quot;

Rei blushed a bit. &quot;Usagi, actually.&quot;

Ami&#39;s hand tightened on hers, and she began to laugh. &quot;Join the club. 
I&#39;m sure all the Senshi are half in love with her.&quot; Ami looked up into 
Rei&#39;s eyes, the laughter dying away. Her sapphire blue eyes seemed to 
darken as she gazed at Rei.

&quot;Ami?&quot; Rei asked, her eyes locked with Ami&#39;s.

Ami leaned slowly across the table, and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ve 
wanted to do this all night.&quot; Her lips softly touched Rei&#39;s, then she 
drew back.

Rei opened her eyes, looking up at Ami. &quot;So have I,&quot; Rei admitted, and 
pulled her into another kiss. They kissed for a few moments, then 
pulled back.

&quot;Was the spark there?&quot; Ami asked Rei in a slightly husky tone.

&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Rei said with a smile. &quot;Ami, I think I love you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve loved you forever,&quot; Ami said, tears in her eyes. &quot;I think I&#39;ve 
had enough dinner, how about you?&quot; Ami asked, giving her a intense 
gaze.

Rei smiled back at her. &quot;I&#39;m full,&quot; she said sexily.

The cab ride home was a blur in Rei&#39;s mind. Ami stepped out, walked 
around the cab, and with a seductive smile helped her out. The walked 
slowly and steadily up the steps until the passed the shrine gate. Rei 
led Ami up to her room, and Ami stopped at the door, her hand keeping 
Rei from opening it.

&quot;Rei, we don&#39;t have to do this if you don&#39;t want...&quot; Ami started, when 
Rei grabbed her by the collar and pulled them into an intense kiss. 
They separated, finally, with a gasp of air.

&quot;If we don&#39;t go in there right now,&quot; Rei said in dangerous tones, &quot;I 
swear I&#39;ll take you on the hallway floor.&quot;

Ami quickly slid the door open and stepped inside. She drew Rei into 
another lingering kiss, temporarily freeing one hand a moment to 
slowly and firmly pull the door shut behind them.
