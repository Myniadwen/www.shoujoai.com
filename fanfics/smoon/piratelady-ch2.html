<h1>The Pirate and Her Lady: A Tale of Minako and Hotaru (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/piratelady-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>It took nearly a week for the two vessels to reach the
secluded island, a most unusual week for Miss Hotaru
Tomoe. Aboard Minako&#39;s vessel the Moon Princess she
worked alongside the pirates, the slim black haired
young women doing much of the same jobs as she had
under Lord Diamond. Unlike serving him, however, she
found the tasks enjoyable surrounded by the cheerful
crew, the captain kind but still strict.

&#39;Minako...&#39; Hotaru thought, watching the blonde woman
up at the wheel as the island grew in front of them.
Her golden main glittered in the sun, her leather and
white garb clinging to her graceful body. She was
strikingly beautiful, even more so out here where she
seemed so free, and more often than not Hotaru found
herself hypnotized by her.

&quot;Hotaru?&quot; her father asked, and she jerked up in
surprise.

&quot;Yes, Father?&quot; Hotaru turned, a guilty flush coloring
her now lightly tanned cheeks. Her father looked much
better dressed in clean clothes, his black hair swept
back by the breeze. He had quickly settled into a
place with the crew, working alongside Ami Mizuno, a
former nurse who served as the Princess&#39;s doctor. The
eye-patch still startled her at times, a reminder of
Diamond&#39;s cruelty, but she found it gave him a rakish
charm.

Dr. Tomoe settled beside her at the rail, the two
looking away from the captain and towards the island.
&quot;Have you decided what you want to do yet?&quot; he asked
her gently.

&quot;I will be guided by your decision, Father,&quot; Hotaru
said gently.

&quot;I&#39;d like to know your mind on this,&quot; Doc. said
quietly, &quot;for whatever decision I make will limit your
own options.&quot; A faint smile appeared on his lips, &quot;I
must admit I am tempted to take up her offer to serve
aboard one of her ships.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Hotaru felt mildly surprised by that decision,
considering how badly he had suffered at Diamond&#39;s
hands.

&quot;Once Minako restores that wreck it will need a
Doctor,&quot; Doc. nodded toward the battered vessel that
limped along behind them then he answered her unspoken
question, &quot;and any captain chosen by Minako would be a
different sort than Diamond.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Hotaru conceded. She found her gaze
tending towards where Minako commanded the vessel,
then back to her father, &quot;I haven&#39;t made my choice
between vessel and shore yet, but I do think I would
remain among these pirates.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Doc. smiled happily. He nodded towards Minako,
&quot;From things she has said, I suspect our Captain would
miss your company.&quot;

Hotaru felt herself blush, a feeling of pleasure
racing through her. Each night this past week she had
shared a dinner with the captain, sometimes just with
Minako and other times with members of the crew and
her father, and she had enjoyed herself immensely.
Minako had been very attentive to her at those times,
making sure her glass and plate were full and even
scolding a crew member if any offered some
unintentional disrespect.

&quot;And I would miss hers,&quot; Hotaru admitted softly.

It was less than a hour later that they tied up to the
docks, a busy set of wooden ramps reaching out over
calm blue waters. Many larger and smaller vessels were
tied up there, but they were dwarfed by the two great
ships sliding into place. Men and women raced to tie
the ships up, then ramps were set into place as the
unloading began.

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Hotaru murmured as all the stock stolen
from Diamond&#39;s ship along with the Moon Princess&#39;
supplies were loaded up on carts then hauled up the
road to the bustling town.

Hotaru had fought to keep her expectations low, to
prepare herself for the worst, but in this she was
pleasantly surprised. The town was remarkably neat,
much like the country places she had visited in her
youth, the pirates greeted with happy cries as they
approached. Yes, there was a tavern with much revelry
going on and she suspected that at least some of the
ladies loitering about were prostitutes, but all in
all it was a beautiful place.

&quot;Usagi,&quot; a black haired young man rushed over to hug
the blonde, then surprisingly Rei joined them in the
hug.

&quot;Mamoru love, we&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Rei slapped him on
the ass, making him jump.

&quot;And I&#39;ve missed you two,&quot; Mamoru laughed as the three
strode off together.

Doc. Tomoe had the oddest look on his face, &quot;From
seeing them on the ship I thought that Rei and Usagi
were....&quot;

&quot;They are,&quot; Minako chuckled from where she walked
nearby Hotaru and him, &quot;but they are with Mamoru,
too.&quot; She shrugged eloquently, &quot;I&#39;m not sure how it
works, but for them it seems to.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Hotaru blinked. She coughed slightly, &quot;I was
wondering if there was a hotel or some such, that my
father an I might find lodging...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, no,&quot; Minako sounded faintly apologetic,
&quot;but I do have a suggestion.&quot; As Hotaru looked over at
her questioningly Minako continued, &quot;I would be
honored for you to stay in my home, at least until we
can build a place for you.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d be honored,&quot; Doc. said smoothly, even as a blush
colored Hotaru&#39;s cheeks.

&quot;Good,&quot; Minako laughed as she took their hands and
tugged them along, &quot;let&#39;s go get you settled in.&quot;

With a laugh Hotaru followed, once again pulled along
by the captain&#39;s joyous spirit. &quot;It won&#39;t be too much
of an inconvenience?&quot; she laughed, black leggings and
leather garb warm in the sun. She didn&#39;t know where
Minako had found the garb on the Moon Princess but it
was comfortable, much more so than the tattered skirts
she had once worn.

&quot;We&#39;ll manage,&quot; Minako chuckled.

The house was larger than the small, one bedroom ones
in town, and set slightly apart from the rest of the
town. Amid the Caribbean trees it stood boldly, two
stories tall with a porch and several rooms on the
first level and a smaller second floor. The main floor
had a large living room, kitchen, dining room and a
bedroom, while upstairs was another larger bedroom.

Doc. Tomoe looked around with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m
impressed.&quot;

&quot;The town insisted on building a larger home for me,&quot;
Minako made a face, &quot;since I&#39;m lead captain and mayor,
sort of.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve eared it,&quot; Hotaru commented quietly,
amused to see the older woman blush.

&quot;At least it gives me enough room to put you both up
here,&quot; Minako said firmly. Quietly she added, &quot;Hotaru,
I&#39;m sorry to say that you&#39;ll have to share a room with
your father.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; Hotaru bowed.

&quot;Or,&quot; Doc. spoke up with a smile, &quot;she could always
share a room with you, captain. You are two women, so
there would be no impropriety there.&quot;

Hotaru felt her heart race, the idea of sharing a room
with Minako strangely exciting to her. &quot;If you
wouldn&#39;t mind?&quot; she asked Minako softly.

A faint blush colored Minako&#39;s cheeks again but her
voice was steady, &quot;I&#39;d be honored.&quot; She showed Doc. to
his room then led Hotaru upstairs as she said, &quot;I
think I have a dress or two that might fit you, until
we can get you some clothes made.&quot;

&quot;To be honest,&quot; Hotaru answered, feeling a bit
startled as she focused on the sway of Minako&#39;s hips
just ahead of her o the stairs up, &quot;I like these
clothes you&#39;ve given me.&quot;

The bedroom they entered was surprisingly feminine,
considering the tough image that Minako seemed to try
to maintain. The sheets of the great bed were a faint
rose, while the walls gleamed pure white. Twin
wardrobes were set up on each side of the room and a
dresser with mirror was pushed up against one wall.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Minako&#39;s voice was gently teasing, &quot;but I
think you&#39;d like to change into something that isn&#39;t
stiff with salt and scratching at your skin.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Hotaru chuckled softly.

Opening up both wardrobes Minako smiled, &quot;Take what
you will, I know enough sewing to help make it fit.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hotaru murmured, digging through the
tightly packed garments. From the corner of her eye
she saw Minako undo the ties in the front of her
blouse, revealing tanned skin and the faint white
traces of scars as she pulled it off.

&quot;I think you will enjoy the celebration tonight,&quot;
Minako continued, unaware of Hotaru&#39;s searching gaze.

Without consciously thinking about it Hotaru moved
across the room, her fingers tracing a white scar that
started at the shoulder then ran down her back. &quot;So
many scars,&quot; she murmured as she touched that creamy
skin, &quot;do each of them have a story?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Minako&#39;s voice was oddly husky as Hotaru
stroked her back. &quot;Do not touch me so,&quot; she shuddered
slightly and continued in a voice thick with longing,
&quot;for I fear I may forget that I am a gentlewoman and
do something rash.&quot;

&quot;I fear I am no gentlewoman, either,&quot; Hotaru answered
her as she gently traced a scar to the base of
Minako&#39;s hips. She breathed in the sea scent in
Minako&#39;s hair as she continued, &quot;I never said how I
looked forward to your visits in London, or how
heartbroken I was when you were gone.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Minako turned, uncaring that she was topless
as she gazed into Hotaru&#39;s eyes, seemingly reassured
by what she saw in them. She reached out to stroke
black hair away from Hotaru&#39;s face, &quot;You know, I lied
when I said I went looking for you both.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Hotaru sighed happily as she leaned into
Minako&#39;s touch.

&quot;While rescuing your father was important,&quot; Minako
confessed as she drew Hotaru close, &quot;saving you was
what drove me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; and with that Hotaru drew the taller woman
into a kiss.

Reluctantly Minako drew back after a few moments. &quot;I
wonder how long your father will stay occupied in his
room?&quot; she asked.

Hotaru chuckled softly as she pointed out, &quot;I suspect
he&#39;ll take his time, considering how deftly he
maneuvered us together.&quot;

&quot;He did, didn&#39;t he?&quot; Minako chuckled herself as she
gently drew Hotaru over to the bed. As they lay down
together she added, &quot;Then he&#39;d better wait a long
time.&quot;</pre>
