<h1>Love and Beauty (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lovebeauty-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Makoto looked around her, checking her small apartment one last time. 
Everything was neat, as (mostly) always, there was food in the 
refrigerator and ingredients for steamed buns with sweet red bean 
paste out on the counter. She glanced over at the mirror again to 
appraise her own appearance. She had on a tailored shirt the same 
color as her eyes, brown slacks and a tie of the same shade. She had 
decided to leave her hair in its usual ponytail, after hours of trying 
to find a more attractive style for it. Fed up, she put it into the 
ponytail and admitted, reluctantly, that it looked just fine.

The buzzer rang, setting her heart racing. How was she going to 
explain her clothes? This is *not* what you cook in, she thought 
desperately. The air seemed thick and hot in the room, but now the 
buzzer sounded a second time and she had to say something....

&quot;One moment, please!&quot; she called and looked around wildly. Nothing 
obvious...nothing that would give away...what? Her true feelings? They 
were appallingly obvious, unfortunately. Quivering with nervousness, 
Makoto walked towards the door. This is just Minako-chan, Aino Minako, 
a friend of yours for years - just chill out! she yelled at herself, 
but it didn&#39;t help.

She gripped the door handle and almost passed out. Breathe you dolt! 
her mind called and she did, deeply, as if she were about to face an 
opponent. Then she jerked the door open...

Minako stood up stiffly, as if she had been leaning against the 
doorjamb. Makoto stared at her, open-mouthed. Her hair looked as soft 
as the finest silk and her dress matched her eyes perfectly. It was a 
deep blue, cut Hong Kong style, with a gold brocade pattern and trim. 
Red and gold designs chased over and through the blue, catching the 
light.

When Makoto&#39;s eyes finally rose to take in Minako&#39;s face, she caught 
her breath. Venus, indeed, she breathed. They stood for a moment, 
silent, locked in a battle of mutual appreciation. Finally, Minako 
reached out and lightly picked up the tie. Makoto held herself rigid, 
trying not to flinch from the electricity in Minako&#39;s touch.

&quot;It suits you.&quot; Minako said. &quot;No pun intended.&quot; There was a pause and 
both girls began to laugh. 

As if that had broken the tension, Makoto moved back from the door and 
asked Minako to enter. Minako looked around, curiously.

&quot;Have you ever been here?&quot; Makoto asked, moving to the comfort of the 
kitchen.

Minako, walking around the room, nodded. &quot;Once or twice.&quot; She followed 
Mako-chan to the kitchen area and insisted on helping with making tea. 
Makoto couldn&#39;t be sure, but she was sure Minako was watching her from 
under lowered lids, whenever she wasn&#39;t looking. There was, no doubt, 
however, that she was brushing her body against Makoto&#39;s at every 
opportunity. Her hand, lightly brushed a sleeve, her hand, a leg. Even 
Minako&#39;s hair was wielded as a weapon, sliding lightly across Makoto&#39;s 
arm at every turn.

The tea-making process took forever, but neither girl seemed to be in 
a rush. At the last moment, Makoto added a few sweet dumplings to the 
platter and then, almost tripping in her haste to sit, praying her 
legs wouldn&#39;t melt under her, led Minako to the sofa.

&quot;May I pour?&quot; Minako asked sweetly. Makoto nodded, completely 
bewitched by her friend&#39;s movements, the way her body made the dress 
sway and cling. 

Minako reached across the tray and with surprisingly delicate motions, 
poured two cups of tea. She also picked up a bun and held it in one 
hand. Turning to Makoto, she smiled. &quot;I know we said we&#39;d go on a 
picnic, &quot; she commented quickly, &quot;but it&#39;s not so nice out...why don&#39;t 
we stay here today?&quot; Her question was ingenuous and Makoto laughed.

&quot;Well,&quot; she admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t think either of us are really dressed 
for a picnic...&quot; she watched, fascinated, as Minako-chan bit into the 
bun she held, exposing the bean paste center. Minako looked into 
Mako-chan&#39;s eyes and slowly, with one finger, scooped some of the bean 
paste out of the dumpling. Without taking her eyes from Makoto&#39;s, she 
slowly licked her finger with the tip of her tongue, then even more 
slowly, inserted it into her mouth, savoring the bean paste. Makoto 
thought she would pass out with pleasure.

&quot;Now it&#39;s your turn,&quot; Minako stated and scooped up more of the bean 
paste. Her finger approached Makoto&#39;s lips and automatically, the 
taller girl opened her mouth. At the touch of the blonde&#39;s finger to 
her tongue, Makoto&#39;s head seemed to explode. Instinct took over and 
she rolled her tongue over the finger in her mouth, watching Minako&#39;s 
breath become shorter and shallower.

Tantalizingly, Minako took her finger back, scooped up more filling 
and once again, ate it sensuously. Makoto had to remind herself to 
breathe. This time, though, Minako-chan left some of the filling 
untasted on her tongue. She opened her mouth slightly and Mako-chan 
felt herself being drawn, inexorably towards Minako&#39;s lips. No 
thoughts entered her mind, except the driving need to kiss Minako and 
taste her. Minako melted her body against her friend&#39;s and their lips 
met. Makoto felt the pressure of Minako&#39;s tongue on her teeth and she 
parted her own mouth, allowing the sweetness of the bean paste to be 
accentuated by Minako&#39;s own essence. Minako&#39;s hands clasped Makoto&#39;s 
shoulders tightly as they kissed for the first time. Makoto pulled the 
smaller woman into a strong embrace. 

There was a deep silence when they final broke off their kiss. Minako 
lowered her head for a moment and Makoto was able to breathe in her 
scent. She lowered her face into Minako&#39;s hair and inhaled. Minako 
looked up into sparkling green eyes.

&quot;I knew you were strong, but I had no idea....&quot; Her hands stroked 
Makoto&#39;s shoulders, then ran down along her upper arms, then back up 
to the shoulders and down onto Makoto&#39;s chest. Makoto stiffened for a 
second, then quickly relaxed.

&quot;Are you comfortable with this?&quot; Minako asked as she played with 
Makoto&#39;s tie. 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Makoto said simply. &quot;Are you?&quot; 

Minako smiled coyly. &quot;I *am* Sailor Venus....&quot; She let the thought 
linger as she began to kiss and nuzzle the area just above Makoto&#39;s 
collar. Her hands stroked along the buttons on Makoto&#39;s shirt, feeling 
the muscular, yet surprisingly soft body beneath.

&quot;I know this sounds silly, but I never thought of that.&quot; Makoto 
laughed, then caught her breath as a hand brushed a nipple, which 
instantly hardened.

&quot;I have.&quot; Minako said softly, then took one of Makoto&#39;s hands and 
placed it on her own leg. 

Makoto felt a moan wrenched out of her throat. The stockings Minako 
wore were silk. Between that sensation of a leg in silk and the touch 
of hands and mouth, any reservations Makoto had was gone. She stroked 
the leg beneath her hand, reveling in the feel of silk and skin.

Minako began to loosen her tie. &quot;This is my favorite part,&quot; she 
admitted. &quot;It&#39;s like unwrapping a present.&quot; Makoto let her head loll 
back with pleasure and gasped as lips, tongue and teeth fastened 
themselves to her throat. Her moans became growls when Minako bit her 
and she pushed the blonde back on the sofa, burying her own face in 
Minako&#39;s neck.

&quot;Ahhhhhhhh...&quot; Minako purred, which made Makoto smile. She busied 
herself with unfastening the first stay of Minako&#39;s dress, and 
familiarizing herself with the flesh it contained. Short work was made 
of the next few fasteners. Makoto let out a low groan as Minako arced 
her back, surrounding her with pale, soft breasts. Makoto thought she 
could very well stay here forever. One hand was placed upon a breast 
and it automatically began to fondle the skin beneath it.

Makoto let her lips trace a path over the other breast and smiled to 
hear Minako&#39;s soft response.

At some point, Minako&#39;s dress had been shed completely and she sat up, 
a little shyly. She batted Makoto&#39;s hands away from her and reattacked 
her friend&#39;s tie and collar. Tantalizingly she undid each button and 
touched the skin in the area, following her fingers with her lips. 
Makoto let her eyes close and lost herself in the sensation. As Minako 
peeled back the tailored shirt, she smiled to see Mako-chan in a lacy 
pink bra, through which she could just see the darkness of nipples. 
Minako tongued one shadowy area, then the next, watching as blood 
rushed to the area, and to Makoto&#39;s throat. She couldn&#39;t help herself 
and she lunged at Makoto&#39;s chest, drawing the hardened nipple into her 
mouth, rolling the other one between her fingers. 

Makoto pushed Minako away for a moment, then shrugged her shirt off. 
When her hands went to unfasten her belt, Minako pushed them away. 
Kneeling before Makoto, Minako unbuckled the belt, unfastened the 
pants and then, with help from Makoto, slid each leg down, helped 
Makoto remove her foot from the pants leg, then the other. She moved 
her face up to the junction of inner thigh, sliding her hair along 
Makoto&#39;s legs.

Makoto fell backwards as the sensation became too much for her. Minako 
parted Mako-chan&#39;s legs slightly, and nuzzled the inner thigh and 
satin clad mound in front of her. She traced shapes with her tongue, 
edging it into the crevasse at the edge of the satin underwear, 
letting her hands trail along muscular thighs and ass. Makoto thrust 
her pelvis forward as Minako grabbed both butt cheeks and began to 
suck on Makoto through her underwear. Makoto&#39;s groans became louder, 
more urgent and she gripped Minako&#39;s hair in both hands. Minako sat up 
and shook her hair out, letting it spread out over Makoto&#39;s thighs and 
lower torso. Makoto took the opportunity to look at her lover. She 
marveled at her clear skin, now a radiant color. 

Putting her hands on her panties, Makoto asked, &quot;Is this...?&quot; she 
didn&#39;t finish her question, as Minako-chan put her hands on top of her 
own and commenced pushing the satin down, past her knees onto the 
floor. Minako leaned forward, moaning at the Makoto&#39;s scent, drooling 
at the sight of her friend, legs open, her center opening with desire. 
Minako practically dove headfirst into Makoto, an intense passion 
driving her on.

&quot;Venus...&quot; Makoto whispered and Minako answered, her mouth never 
leaving its location... &quot;Jupiter.&quot; Makoto stiffened, then holding onto 
Minako&#39;s head, pulled her lover into herself, Minako thrusting her 
tongue in and out into Makoto, until she was clamped into place by 
strong thighs. 

&quot;Oh, Venusssssssss........&quot; Makoto hissed, then a great moan escaped 
her and Minako could feel the internal spasms crashing in her friend&#39;s 
body. Finally, the thighs released her and Minako laid her head 
against the still quivering body beneath her.
