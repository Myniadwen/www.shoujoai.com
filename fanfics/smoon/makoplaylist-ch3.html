<h1>Makoto's Playlist (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chakeroo.html">chakeroo</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makoplaylist-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><p class="p1">“Are you ready yet Usagichan?” shouted Minako at the foot of the stairs of 
Usagi’s house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Why is she taking so long? 
What if Makoto and the others are already waiting? Makoto and the others? MAKOTO AND THE 
OTHERS?!? Why would I single her out?!? </i>Thought Minako as she gripped the staircase 
harder. She suddenly remembered the hug that Makoto gave her the last time they met. She 
blushed and feeling her face become hot, she started to panic a little.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m coming down Minachan!” shouted the other blonde from her room and after 
a few seconds she ran downstairs. “Why are you blushing?” asked Usagi.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t mind it Odango! Let’s just go to the karaoke bar already!” answered 
Minako without even glancing at the other blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Why do I feel this way about her. I can’t describe it. She makes me feel… 
I don’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> A bewildered Minako thought 
while walking outside the house of Usagi.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">”Minachan wait! You’re walking too fast!” Usagi shouted and the blonde didn’t 
hear her. She was lost in her thoughts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Over at the karaoke bar</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">“As usual they are very <i>very</i> late.” Sighed Haruka.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I told you, you should’ve given them a ride.” Answered Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Haruka sweat dropped. “Ok ok… I’m sorry. I should’ve listened.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Michiru smiled. She noticed Makoto was fidgeting a little bit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What’s the matter Makochan? Are you alright?” asked Michiru, looking really 
concerned at her. Haruka and Rei whispered something to her and she said, “Oh…” and 
laughed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s alright Makochan. Just be yourself and remember to breathe when you see 
her.” Joked Haruka.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You too? You’ve got to be kidding me. Am I <i>THAT</i> obvious?” asked by 
the surprised brunette.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“With the way your acting, you should’ve just put a note in your head that 
reads, ‘I love you Minachan since the first day I saw you. Would you please go out with me? 
P.S. I love you.’” Answered Rei then everybody laughed as Makoto’s face became crimson 
red.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And out of nowhere Usagi jumped Haruka and Ami being startled accidentally 
tossed her drink at the side walk.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m sorry Amichan. I’ll buy you a drink inside. My treat!” Said Usagi.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei’s face became red and started to yell at Usagi. “Why did you have to do 
that?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Usagi looked at Rei who looked like she was startled also, the blonde’s tears 
were building up and she’s beginning to pout. Rei lets out a sigh and ushered the blonde 
inside the karaoke bar. Usagi hugged Rei until they reached the room they reserved. 
Everybody was laughing except for Minako and Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You go first Minachan.” Said Makoto as she gestured towards the door.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>My heart is racing. Don’t blush Minako. Just don’t. You might scare her. 
</i>Minako thought looking at the brunette.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank you Makochan.” Smiled Minako and took Makoto’s hands after she entered 
the Karaoke bar. Makoto can’t help but blush.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">….</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Please make her stop Michiru. It’s getting on my nerves. <i>Please.</i>” 
Pleaded Haruka. She was clasping her ears and was pouting at Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei was massaging her temples so that she would not yell at Usagi for singing 
that Justin Bieber song for the n<sup>th</sup> time since they started.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t care if she’s Queen Serenity! I’ll smack her if she sings that 
fucking song one more time!” Rei said. Ami sweat dropped and patted Rei’s shoulder to 
comfort her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s almost over love. Don’t worry I’ll tell her later to pick out any other 
song ok?” Michiru answered as she puts Haruka’s head unto her shoulders. Haruka then lets 
out a whimper and then hugs Michiru.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto was staring at the two of them and she became envious. Minako was also 
looking at them and then she turned her attention to Makoto and blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>They look so cute and comfortable with each other. I wish I was that close 
to Minako now. </i>Makoto letting out a sigh.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Maybe I should do something. Why am I panicking? It’s normal to hug Makoto 
right?!? Aaaargh!!! This is getting hard when everybody is teasing me about her. But I 
admit, I’ve been feeling this since the day I saw her. What the hell is this feeling? She 
looks so cute on that shirt. And her skin… Stop it Minako!!! She might think you’re weird. 
</i>Minako argued with herself. She was making faces like it was a fight or flight 
situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei and Ami were watching the brunette and the blonde and they whispered to 
each other. Michiru noticed this and winked at the two of them. She then nudged Haruka to 
sit up straight and whispered her something.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto and Minako looked puzzled.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So Harukachan are you taking Michiruchan somewhere special next Saturday 
night for Valentine’s?” Ami asked Haruka.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course! But I won’t tell you where. It’s our own little get away.” Haruka 
answered then kissed Michiru passionately. Michiru then giggled like a school girl after. 
“The best thing that happens is after dinner or maybe at the middle but sometimes you don’t 
even get to start dinner…” Haruka said winking. Michiru then punched the blonde’s arm. 
“You’re such a tease!” Michiru said and laughed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All of them blushed. Usagi was still singing, oblivious to what was going 
on.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So how about all of you?” asked Haruka.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My mom asked me if I could join her for dinner. It’s quite rare to actually 
sit down with her and eat dinner together so I turned down potential dates a few days ago.” 
Answered Ami.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m helping grandpa with the shrine. Some couples go to the shrine during 
the day to pray together and have readings so I have to clean everything up by the end of 
the day. Besides I don’t want a date although some asked me out.” Replied the miko.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Everybody was now staring at Minako and Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Why do I get the feeling that they’re plotting about something? </i>The 
brunette and blonde thought.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I… I… don’t have one….” Makoto’s voice trailed off.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Me too.” Minako answered almost in a whisper.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What? No date? Then you should ask each other out!” All of them answered 
like they were reading a script. Then they all gave a thumbs up.</p>
<p class="p1">Rei grinned at Makoto and gestured that she should ask the blonde out for a 
date. Haruka and Michiru mouthed “Go on!” and gave a thumbs up as Ami winked at her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>This is a conspiracy! Thank Kami she wasn’t looking when they did that. So 
that’s why they brought me here in the first place! Come on Makoto. They’re giving you a 
shot at this! </i>Makoto annoyingly thought.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ummm… Minachan… wou… would you like to go on… you know… like… ummm… eat 
dinner… like you know a date… with… me?” Makoto stuttered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sure! My Makochan!” answered the blonde trying not to blush. She then went 
beside Makoto and laid her head on Makoto’s shoulders. Makoto blushed and then smiled.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Thanks guys. Quality time with my Makochan! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! </i>Minako 
giggled to herself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh you look so cute together! You should go out on a date!” shouted Usagi, 
seeing Minako and Makoto after finishing the song.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No more Justin Beiber songs, you hear!” Rei shouted as she threatened to 
throw the other mic at Usagi. The two started running around the room and Ami sweat 
dropped. Haruka then looked at Makoto and winked at her. Makoto mouthed, “Thanks guys.” And 
smiled.</p>
