<h1>Plus de Compassion (More Than Sympathy) (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/plusde-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&#147;You won it!!!&#148; Rumiko danced around Haruka and Michiru and laughed 
happily. &#147;You even beat Tsukasa!&#148;

It was a very warm day and the competition took place in the huge 
arena of Tokyo. The sprints were over now and of course Haruka had 
won.

&#147;Congratulations. I&#146;ve never seen anyone being as fast as you.&#148; Ami 
bowed but her book laid open next to the big blanket. 

&#147;Hai.&#148; Agreed Usagi and wanted to steal another sandwich out of the 
picnic basket Makoto made for them. Although the tall girl was only 
twelve years old she was very talented in making food and especially 
sandwiches.

&#147;You greedy jerk!&#148; scold Rei and tried hard to hide the rest of her 
sandwich behind her back. Soon the both argued again while Makoto 
brought her picnic basket into safety. It was also made for the racer 
and the handicapped beauty. Usagi and Rei shouldn&#146;t eat everything.

&#147;That&#146;s a good reason for party.&#148; Declared Minako laughing and 
switched on the CD player. Loud pop music filled the air but it wasn&#146;t 
louder then the yelling of the pupils as the high jump started.

Michiru smiled up to her girlfriend. Haruka looked healthier now. She 
needed over six weeks to get fifteen pounds back and there were a lot 
of serious talks between them when Haruka tried to start her dangerous 
starving again. Two weeks ago she had her second period of her life 
but she handled it well. She trained hard for the competition and now 
she was finally able to end the contest between Tsukasa and her. 
Michiru trained playing the violin again and she already thought about 
giving a concert. Her doctor declared that she made big progresses and 
even if she didn&#146;t believe him, she felt that she could be happy with 
her handicapped body each time she was able to swim in the sea. Haruka 
bought her a swim ring and for the last five weeks she took part in 
special courses for paralysed people. There she learned step by step 
that it was possible to swim without the use of legs.

Michiru raised her head as Haruka thanked for the congratulations and 
went over to her and sat down next to her on the huge blanket. The 
wheelchair stood somewhere in the shadow of the big tree above. 
Without saying a word Haruka embraced her girlfriend and held her 
tight.

Hai, we both survived our darkest hours. 

&#147;Ten&ocirc; Haruka?&#148; The young racer looked up as she heard the low voice 
and blinked against the sun. Tsukasa stood there. He hold the silver 
medal in his hands and smiled friendly down at her. &#147;Congratulations, 
you&#146;re the best athlete of Mugen Gakkuen. You was it even when I beat 
you in spring. But you didn&#146;t really loose because you stopped before 
the finish line. &#145;Cause you wanted to help her.&#148; Tsukasa looked down 
at Michiru and bowed slightly. &#147;Gomen, that I called you a cripple.&#148;

Michiru simply smiled back and reached her hand to touch his right 
arm.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, Tsukasa. We all make our own faults time by time.&#148; She 
declared.

&#147;You&#146;re a very good opponent.&#148; Added Haruka and nodded agreeing. 
Tsukasa bowed again and wanted to go as Makoto opened her picnic 
basket again.

&#147;Do you want anything to eat, Tsukasa?&#148; she asked and held a sandwich 
up. Usagi looked greedy at it and tried to catch it. But Makoto was 
faster.

&#147;I&#146;d like to.&#148; Said the tall boy and took it.

The crying of Usagi could be heard all over the arena. And the 
laughter of the other girls, too.

***

Haruka rose from her bed and looked shocked into the darkness that 
surrounded her. Only slowly she could see some light again that shone 
through the open window. The young racer took a deep breathe and ran a 
trembling hand through her now sweaty short hair. Desperately she 
tried to calm down her body and her nerves. She closed her eyes again 
and shook slightly her head. Then she recognized that she was 
observed. Haruka turned her head and looked into Michiru&#146;s big blue 
eyes. The smaller girl looked very frightened, too.

&#147;Did you have this nightmare, too?&#148; asked Haruka and laid back on the 
pillow. She preferred to go to take a shower but as Michiru took her 
into a comforting, loving embrace she only wanted to stay there.

&#147;That the whole world&#146;s going to end? That some strange messiah will 
destroy it until something is found?&#148; Michiru&#146;s voice was shaky but in 
her girlfriend&#146;s near it all looked like a lousy nightmare. It was 
only very strange that they shared the same nightmare. And that it 
came back, almost every night.

&#147;Hai.&#148; Haruka leaned her head against Michiru&#146;s and yawned again. 
Although the dream had been very scary she was very tired. It was in 
the middle of the night the next day was going to be the last one of 
this school year. Haruka and Michiru didn&#146;t really decide what to do 
in their holidays but Haruka often mentioned that they should go and 
visit Europe as Michiru always wanted to. The young violinist still 
hesitated because she wasn&#146;t sure if it was possible to enjoy such a 
long journey in a wheelchair. But Haruka was certain that she would 
convince her girlfriend the next week.

&#147;It was just a silly nightmare.&#148; Declared Michiru quietly and embraced 
her girlfriend tighter.

&#147;Hai.&#148; Agreed Haruka with he same quiet voice.

But both couldn&#146;t believe their own words any longer.

***

&#147;Are you satisfied with your report?&#148; asked Michiru and put down the 
paper on the table. They sat together on their balcony and enjoyed the 
nice weather. The coffee smelled well and the cake was delicious 
Makoto gave them some days before. &#147;Because it isn&#146;t so good as mine.&#148; 
Teased the young violinist and leaned back on her deckchair. Her weak 
legs were covered with a thin blanket and she wore a dark blue summer 
dress. She hold her sea green hairs to a knot in her neck but some 
strands already moved in the warm breeze around her ears.

&#147;Actually it&#146;s the best report I ever had.&#148; Declared Haruka and stared 
in disbelieve at the good mark she got in French. She didn&#146;t know how 
she reached it but she knew that it had to do something with those 
hours she spend with her girlfriend practising for the next test.

At least she&#146;s not as serious about it as Ami.

Haruka smiled when she thought at those lessons in their living-room 
which ended always on the comfortable couch. After two hours of 
learning Haruka needed something completely different. And kissing her 
Michi-chan was the greatest pleasure for her. Even more when Michiru 
forgot over their tender kisses that she actually wanted to ask her 
Ruka some vocabulary.

&#147;And no one will beat me for it.&#148; Declared Haruka very silently with a 
sudden and put her report to Michiru&#146;s. The young violinist looked up, 
then she knocked on the free space of her deckchair.

&#147;Come over, Ruka.&#148;

The young racer did as she said and soon they kissed again.

I love you, Ruka.

I love you. Michi-chan.

At that moment the bell rang and interrupted their romantic 
atmosphere. Haruka rolled her eyes while Michiru only giggled.

&#147;Guess it&#146;s Rumiko. Or Usagi and her crazy friends.&#148;

&#147;Maybe she wants to cry because of her bad report.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s only twelve. She has so much time to learn so much more.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t tell that Ami.&#148;

&#147;I won&#146;t.&#148; Michiru giggled again and leaned back on her deckchair to 
enjoy the shinning of the sun. Haruka went into their shadowy 
apartment to open the door.

&#147;If your want to go to swim, Rumiko, we...&#148; said the young racer but 
her voice died slowly away as she saw the figure standing outside on 
the corridor. It wasn&#146;t the always laughing girl. &#147;What...&#148; whispered 
Haruka shocked and blinked but the shadow didn&#146;t disappear. Nor did 
the anger in that redden face the young racer learned to hate so much 
during her childhood.

&#147;You traitor!&#148; her father slapped her hard into the face as he entered 
the apartment. He was faster then the surprised girl and so Haruka 
couldn&#146;t close the door in time. She whimpered as she hit the floor 
hard. Her father grabbed the collar of her school uniform&#146;s shirt and 
lifted her up again. &#147;How could you dare to run away! You almost won 
the Grand Prix and then you disappeared. The referees had to 
disqualify you although you was the best racer!&#148; He slapped her again 
right into the face and Haruka felt the hot fluid running down her 
chin. Her nose hurt a lot and she asked herself how long she would 
have to wore her sunglasses this time. &#147;Why did you just leave without 
ever telling me that you&#146;re still alive! Why did you hide yourself in 
that bloody school? I&#146;ve chosen the best school for you and you simply 
took this one!&#148; He beat her again but this time she defended herself 
and he let go of her. Hard she fell on the carpet again and coughed as 
blood got into her throat.

&#147;You&#146;re such a dishonour. All I wanted was a nice boy and all I got 
was you! How could you even dare to betray me in that way!&#148;

&#147;Leave her in peace!&#148;

The tall man looked up in surprise as he heard the high voice from the 
balcony. He turned his head and stared in disbelieve at the girl down 
in the wheelchair. He watched her how she rolled protectively between 
him and his daughter.

&#147;You&#146;re still together with this witch?&#148; asked the tall man and looked 
down at the smaller girl in disbelieve. Soon his expression turned 
from surprise into disgust and finally into hate.

&#147;I told you she&#146;s just a spoiled brat. She will use you until she&#146;s 
sick of you. Then she will leave you and where will you go then?&#148; 
declared Mr. Ten&ocirc; icy. &#147;Be a good boy, Haruka, and come home with me. 
You always loved the race track and you was satisfied with your nice 
life you lived in my great house. You was good at school and you won 
so many races. You just can&#146;t let this end just like that.&#148; He stepped 
forward and tried to grab Haruka&#146;s arm. The girl shook silently her 
head. Blood run over her chin and dropped on her school uniform&#146;s 
shirt. She squinted and her eyes quickly swelled. Her body trembled as 
she leaned forward and seized on the wheelchair&#146;s handlebars.

&#147;I said leave her in peace!&#148; Michiru&#146;s blue eyes looked determined up 
to him. Her love for the taller girl was stronger than any fear before 
the man that was her girlfriend&#146;s father.

&#147;Haruka is a girl. She&#146;s my girlfriend. And she won&#146;t go anywhere. 
Especially not with you!&#148; declared the young violinist and her voice 
made sure that she would do anything to protect the taller girl. 
Anything. Even if it was not in her might now.

&#147;No!&#148; The man pushed the wheelchair aside before Michiru could react 
and grabbed the bloody shirt of his daughter again. &#147;No, you&#146;re my 
beloved son! You&#146;re the future World&#146;s Champion. You will keep our 
family tradition and our name alive!&#148; he declared while he pulled 
Haruka towards the still open door. &#147;You don&#146;t belong to this crazy 
school. To this cripple. She only misuses you. Don&#146;t ya see, my boy, 
that she&#146;s a witch? She will bring you so much bad luck as your mother 
did to me. She will leave you before you can say goodbye. Before you 
can really love her. No, her feelings aren&#146;t love. Her feeling are 
just lust. She&#146;ll be a terrible mother and when you&#146;ll have a child 
one day she will disappear into nothing and leave you with that crying 
bundle behind. Trust me, all women are the same!&#148; The man looked with 
wild eyes at Michiru but the young violinist wasn&#146;t sure if he still 
saw her. Or if he confused her with another woman. Maybe with his own 
wife...

&#147;Maybe she&#146;s good in bed. That&#146;s what they all are first. But she will 
never see your soul and you&#146;ll never be able to reach her heart.&#148; His 
sad eyes got angry again. &#147;And now, let&#146;s go, Haruka!&#148;

&#147;No!&#148; Haruka choked because of the blood that run in her throat. She 
tried to pull herself free but he was still taller and still stronger 
than her. &#147;Michi-chan&#146;s the person I belong to. I love her and she 
loves me. I won&#146;t return in the hell I escaped when I left you!&#148;

She winced back as he slapped her hard again into the face. Her nose 
bleed even more and tears burned in her dark green eyes as the pain 
increased.

&#147;You&#146;re a stupid, love-drunken jerk. But it will soon be over when you 
recognize that she&#146;s just a bloody bitch as all the other women, too. 
She&#146;s a whore. When you&#146;re gone she&#146;ll take the next guy in her bed 
and forget about you very fast. The same way you will did, my son. I 
know it. I...&#148;

&#147;You know nothing!&#148; Haruka finally pulled herself free and shook her 
aching head. She reeled and almost crashed against the wall. Her 
bloody face was almost as white as the wallpaper behind her. Michiru 
wanted to roll over but suddenly she didn&#146;t have the power anymore. 
Her whole body seemed to be paralysed, not only her weak legs. With 
big blue eyes she watched her girlfriend and the man who almost killed 
her &#150; without using a weapon...

&#147;Michi-chan&#146;s my savior! Without her I would be dead! I didn&#146;t want to 
live anymore under your dictatorship. I was so fed up with you beating 
me for every tiny fault. I was so sick of seeing you drunk almost 
every evening. And I was so tired of you calling me your good boy. 
Hell, father, I am a girl. I was it when I was born and I will still 
be a girl when I&#146;ll die one day. Really, I wanted to finish with all 
this bloody hell you created for me. My life was dark and hopeless. 
And then I met Michi-chan. She&#146;s my light in my darkness. She&#146;s the 
one who&#146;s keeping me going on. She&#146;s the only reason for me being 
alive! Not you or your bloody races. She&#146;s the one I am living for.&#148; 
Haruka didn&#146;t even mention that tears were running down her pale 
cheeks. She swallowed hard and her own blood tasted salty.

Her father blinked, then he grabbed her collar with a sudden and threw 
her out of the apartment.

&#147;She bewitched you. I knew it. But everything will be right, when 
she&#146;s gone. When she leaves you the same way your mother did to me!&#148;

Haruka whimpered as she landed hard on the floor. She raised her head 
and her look blurred. But she concentrated and forced herself not to 
become unconscious. The young racer mentioned a motion near the 
elevators. Slowly she turned her head and saw a small girl standing 
near the door. She wore a long black dress and her dark eyes looked 
sadly at her.

Haruka-papa!

Haruka frowned as she heard the happy child&#146;s voice in her head. A so 
well known voice she seemed to know all her life although she had 
never heard it before.

The small girl seemed to hold a huge staff in her hands. It was taller 
than her body and metal sparkled in the bright sunlight. Haruka 
blinked again and saw the big scythe in the small girl&#146;s hands. Then 
the vision was gone. The girl spun around and disappeared into the 
elevator again.

Michiru-mama!

Haruka heard the scream evolving inside the apartment. It took her all 
her powers to get on her feet again. The whole world spun around her 
but she didn&#146;t give in her dizzy feelings.

&#147;My boy will be mine again when you disappear out of his mind!&#148; 
declared her father and raised his right hand. Haruka gasped as she 
saw the knife in his hard fingers that hurt her more than once. The 
blade shimmered silver in the sunlight. Michiru tried to escape but 
she laid helpless on the white carpet. The wheelchair laid next to 
her. Turned upside down. Blood covered her cheeks as well and suddenly 
Haruka knew that her father had slapped her, too.

No, not her. She went through so much pain, he mustn&#146;t hurt her the 
same way he did to me! He mustn&#146;t... He mustn&#146;t... Michi-chan!

&#147;No!&#148; Haruka didn&#146;t think of anything but her girlfriend as she jumped 
protectively between her father and the young violinist. She covered 
Michiru with her own body and closed her eyes as the knife made it&#146;s 
way downwards.

&#147;You aren&#146;t my good boy! Where the hell is my good boy? You&#146;re just 
another weak girl. Another unfaithful woman. You aren&#146;t my good boy! 
You&#146;re just a bloody lesbian being in a crazy relationship to a bloody 
cripple. You aren&#146;t my good boy anymore! Where the hell did you put my 
good boy? Where the hell do you hide my good Haruka?&#148; screamed the 
tall man and the knife drove into Haruka&#146;s right arm. She bit on her 
lips and embraced her girlfriend tighter. He had to kill her first 
before he could do her Michi-chan any hurt.

&#147;Never you will hurt her again!&#148; cried Michiru suddenly and raised her 
head. A strange, blue sign shone on her forehead and wind that wasn&#146;t 
there before played with her long sea green hairs. The knife came 
nearer again but this time it was stopped at the blue light that 
surrounded them suddenly.

&#147;What...?&#148; whispered the man confused and looked surprised at his 
knife. The blade was bloody and it escaped his trembling hands. He 
watched how his daughter, no, his son, stood up. But suddenly the 
person before him wasn&#146;t his good boy any longer. Instead he saw a 
girl. She wore a short school uniform which accentuate her female 
outlines. Her dark green eyes shone angry at her.

&#147;You&#146;ll never ever hurt Michi-chan again. As long as I live you&#146;ll 
never get another chance to hurt her, I swear!&#148; he could hear her 
screaming. He stepped back and shook his head in disbelieve. &#147;EARTH 
SHAKING!&#148; He didn&#146;t know what happened. But suddenly he was lifted up 
and pushed against the next wall. Breathe escaped his lung and black 
shadows danced over his eyes as he fell down on the white carpet. But 
he didn&#146;t feel it&#146;s softness. His head ached too much and he wasn&#146;t 
able any longer to move his legs or even his arms. Dreamy he stared at 
the ceiling and waited... For what? He didn&#146;t know. He didn&#146;t know 
anything than that his Haruka had always been a good boy. And that his 
child would always be his good child. The future World Champion. The 
honour of the Ten&ocirc;&#146;s family. He would continue with the family&#146;s 
tradition. The honourable name Ten&ocirc; would never die out.

The man smiled while his look got darker and darker.

&#147;My good boy...&#148; he whispered and took a deep breathe. Then he laid 
calm on the ground. In a silence that would never hurt his daughter 
again. Never he would rage loudly at her again, never he would hurt 
her any more, leave her in silent pain. Now his daughter wasn&#146;t afraid 
of him any loner. Of his silly war he played over all those terrible 
years. Haruka had seen worse. She went through hell, through the 
coldest winter. He couldn&#146;t do her any harm any more.

No, never again. Now I am free of him. At last. Now I can be myself 
again...

Haruka sighed and collapsed slowly. Michiru was there when she went on 
her knees. Two soft arms embraced her tenderly and pulled her towards 
a warm body. It was so comforting there. So save. So secure.

He will never hurt me again. Now I am there where I belong.

Haruka sobbed quietly while Michiru simply hold her tight and rocked 
her gently.

Now I am loved. At last...

They both didn&#146;t mention the police men who rushed stormy into their 
apartment. A man with almost white hairs and a small girl who wore her 
school uniform followed.

&#147;Is this the man who attacked one of my most talented pupils, 
Hotaru-chan?&#148; asked Dr. Tomoe and looked terrified around. He had 
always thought that his school was secure. That no one could do such a 
massacre in his Mugen Gakkuen.

&#147;Hai.&#148; Whispered the girl and slowly left her father&#146;s side.

&#147;Oh, he smells like a whole beer barrel!&#148; said one of the police man 
and laid the tall man in handcuffs.

&#147;He will have a big headache when he awakes.&#148; Declared another police 
man.

&#147;And he&#146;ll have the worst headache of his life when he recognises that 
he almost killed innocent teenagers. Guess the judge won&#146;t be very 
happy about him.&#148;

Dr. Tomoe talked to the police men while they checked the apartment 
and called an ambulance after a look of the injured boy. His brown and 
green school uniform was bloody. None of them saw how Hotaru slowly 
went over to the two girls. No one saw how she kneeled before them in 
the blood that dirt the white carpet. And no one saw how she tried to 
embrace them both with her small arms to comfort them with all the 
love a small girl of her age was able to feel.

***

It rained outside. It was a cool, ugly late summer&#39;s day. The first 
leaves changed their colours and flew from the huge trees around the 
old building.

Haruka listened to the steady sound of raindrops falling against the 
window pane. She didn&#39;t see the other people passing by, talking 
exited. She didn&#39;t see the flashes that lightened the dark corridor a 
little bit. She didn&#39;t even mention that the reporters took photos of 
her. Two reporters came over to her but she only looked confused in 
their faces as they asked her some questions. 

&quot;What do you think of your father&#39;s  conviction?&quot;

&quot;What do you think about his behaviour?&quot;

Haruka corrected her sunglasses and turned away from them. Slowly she 
walked over to the window and watched the rain falling down.

Slightly she remembered the negotiation. She sat there in the first 
row and followed the judge&#39;s words as if she wasn&#39;t there. As if she 
was another person. Watching the play from outside. Haruka couldn&#39;t 
recall what she said to the judge as she had to talk as a witness. All 
she could remember was that she didn&#39;t want to took off her 
sunglasses. She swore on the holy bible and had to say some other odd 
stuff but she didn&#39;t want to show them her scars. That was too 
personally. 

&quot;What do you think about your father&#39;s outbreak after the judgement?&quot; 
The reporter had followed her but still she didn&#39;t answer. With an 
empty expression on her face she stared out of the window and winced 
as she suddenly heard the loud voice in her head again:

&quot;She&#39;s lying! I never hurt my good Haruka! Whom do you believe? A 
honourable business man like me or a bloody lesbian like her?&quot; 

Still she heard his loud rage that filled the whole air of the court. 
He yelled at her, at her girlfriend and finally at the police men and 
the judge.  

&quot;What do you think...?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t you see that she doesn&#39;t want to talk to you?&quot; declared a clear 
voice and Haruka returned from her nightmare back into reality. She 
lowered her head and looked into a determined face of the smaller 
girl. Michiru rolled protectively between her and the reporters.

&quot;You must be the other girl who was also attacked by Mr. Ten&ocirc;. What do 
you think about this whole story?&quot; the reporter came nearer and 
Michiru clenched her fists. She looked as if she would beat him if 
he&#39;d continue to ask another stupid question.

&quot;I said...&quot;

&quot;Are you two a real couple?&quot; The next reporter came nearer and flashes 
crossed the air again. Michiru squinted and blushed in anger. She 
reached her right hand towards the camera but she couldn&#39;t touch it. 
Couldn&#39;t take it away. Couldn&#39;t break it.

&quot;Leave us in peace.&quot; Said Haruka with a quiet voice and was amazed 
that she was still able to speak. Her head ached more and more with 
every second and although she left the hospital two days ago her arm 
still hurt a lot. Suddenly she felt very tired and very sad. All she 
wanted now was to go back to Mugen Gakkuen, lay down on her bed and 
sleep. Being embraced by her girlfriend. Being comforted until she was 
able to forget her personal nightmares. Until she was able to live 
with the memories of the past days. Of the last two years. Of his rude 
hands beating her more than once...

The reporter seemed to say anything more as they brought the tall man 
out. He still yelled at the judge and the police men had a hard job to 
keep him under their control. Flashes crossed again through the air 
and Mr. Ten&ocirc; was now surrounded by the media. He said something to 
them and stayed longer near the door than necessary. His dark eyes 
looked for a long while in empty green ones.

&quot;My good boy...&quot; he whispered before the police men pushed them with 
him. Haruka winced and watched the man who used to be her father until 
he left the building to go in another one. For a very long time.

You never loved me.

Haruka swallowed hard. Then she felt the warm hand that hold her icy 
one tight. It was soft touch and as the taller girl looked at her 
girlfriend she had to take a deep breathe. It was very hard for her 
not to destroy the walls she establish protectively around herself. 
Around her heart. Around her soul. Around her thoughts. It was very 
hard not to break down sobbing to be embraced by those warm, those 
comforting arms. To hear those understanding words and to know that 
there was still someone who wanted her.

Michi-chan loves me...

Haruka smiled a shaky smile. Michiru had been by her side the whole 
time. She hold her hands during the negotiation and she was there when 
she needed her. Since the last September the young violinist had 
always been there. For her. And even if she had her own problems, her 
own nightmare, her personal hell she went through after she had to 
accept her parent&#39;s death and her body being paralysed she never left 
her alone.

Michiru looked loving up in desperate green eyes and squeezed the icy 
hand stronger.

&quot;Let&#39;s go home, Ruka.&quot; She whispered and hold her lover&#39;s hand towards 
her cheek.

You&#39;re the light in my darkness...

Haruka only nodded.

***

The dinner smelled delicious. But she actually wasn&#39;t hungry. Nor did 
she have any appetite. Silently she stared on her plate and knew that 
she should eat something. The steak looked very good and she loved 
chips. With a lot of tomato ketchup. Haruka sighed slightly. Michiru 
was still in her room and changed her clothes. She wanted to join her 
in about two minutes.

The young racer stood up and walked out of the balcony. There she sat 
down on one deckchair and watched motionless at the endless ocean. The 
air still smelled of rain and the water was dark now. You could see no 
ground and maybe it was groundless. Under the surface it was calm. No 
voices could be heard. No shouting, no loud rages...

&quot;Ruka?&quot; Haruka winced but she didn&#39;t look up. Slowly Michiru entered 
the great balcony. Her girlfriend just kept staring out to the wide 
horizon. Wind played with her short blonde hair and suddenly Haruka 
looked like a long forgotten hero. From a long forgotten legend.

&quot;It&#39;s not your fault.&quot; Whispered the young violinist and embraced her 
girlfriend tenderly. Haruka sighed, then she looked up. There were no 
tears in her dark green eyes but her expression was still very sad. 
And Michiru felt how the young racer fought against her own feelings. 
She wanted to be strong. Strong enough for both of them. To show their 
destinies without any fears. And it scared her every time she had to 
admit that she wasn&#39;t that strong at all.

Not alone...

&quot;I know...&quot; Haruka replied very quietly and leaned her forehead 
against Michiru&#39;s one. &quot;I know, Michi-chan. But still it hurts. The 
wound will heal and maybe the scars will disappear some day. But I am 
not sure, if...&quot;

&quot;But I am sure.&quot; Before Haruka could say anything more Michiru had 
pulled her girlfriend closer and gave her a long and loving kiss. The 
young racer smiled a shaky smile against her lips and returned her 
kiss with the love she felt for her. With all her passion. With all 
the strong feelings she wasn&#39;t able to explain with simple words.

&quot;Happy birthday.&quot; Whispered Michiru and reached for the bag that hung 
over her wheelchair&#39;s handlebars. She smiled at her girlfriend as she 
took the gift in her hands.

&quot;You remember it?&quot; asked Haruka surprised and swallowed hard Suddenly 
her cold hands trembled.

&quot;Of course. You mentioned it over two years ago.&quot;

&quot;Now three years...&quot; answered Haruka and raised her hand to shake the 
gift. She frowned as she heard nothing? &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked 
curiously and the sad expression slowly disappeared from her now 
redden face. It was replaced by an attentive smile. Impatient she 
unwrapped it. Her smile faded and she made a disappointed face as she 
saw the make up box. She turned it for some times around but it didn&#39;t 
change into something more suitable.

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; asked Michiru and looked at her with that look 
Haruka couldn&#39;t resist.

&quot;Well...&quot; answered the young carer unsure and asked herself how she 
should use it. She never wore make up and she didn&#39;t know why she 
should begin with it now. &quot;Well...&quot;

Michiru giggled and took the make up box away. She giggled even more 
as she saw the obviously disappointed expression on Haruka&#39;s face.

&quot;Hey, at least it&#39;s my present! You can&#39;t steal it. Michi-chan!&quot; Panic 
grew in Haruka&#39;s face as the young violinist put the make up box into 
the bag again.

&quot;You should see your face!&quot; laughed Michiru and took another gift, a 
tiny box, out of the bag. &quot;The make up box is mine. I bought it 
because my old one is empty now. I just wanted to see your shocked 
look. And Ruka, believe me, it was worth it.&quot; The young violinist 
laughed even more as she gave the small box into Haruka&#39;s still icy 
hands. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t force you to use make up or to wear 
skirts. You know I love you the way you are. That&#39;s your real gift, 
honey. Happy birthday.&quot;

Haruka looked for some seconds in silence at the wrapped box in her 
hands.

That&#146;s the first real birthday present I got since I was five.

She frowned slightly as she remembered fuzzy at different clothes and 
socks.

Guess it&#146;s the first real birthday present in my whole life. Surely 
it&#146;s the first present given with so much love...

&#147;What is it now? A lipstick?&#148; asked Haruka while she unwrapped the 
paper impatiently.

&#147;Of course. A pink one.&#148; Laughed Michiru and was relieved that her 
girlfriend didn&#39;t look so depressed anymore. The young violinist 
didn&#39;t like to see Haruka so sad. She wanted to see her happy. All of 
her life.

I only want to see you laughing, never crying again.

It was a wish she knew she couldn&#39;t full fill. But it was dream to 
begin with.

&quot;What...&quot; Haruka looked puzzled at the key jiggling in her hands. The 
trailer was a silver model of a motor bike. It sparkled in the setting 
sun that finally broke through the thick rain clouds. Then the young 
racer watched her girlfriend in disbelieve. Michiru only giggled and 
rolled over to the rim of the balcony.

&quot;Come over here.&quot; She said and very slowly Haruka followed her. She 
frowned as she recognized the well known motor bike standing next to 
the big car on the parking space.

&quot;It can&#39;t be...&quot; whispered Haruka as she recognized her old Suzuki.

&quot;I bought it from Yamado. He said it&#39;s yours, even if your father once 
paid it.&quot; Michiru raised her hand and touched her girlfriend&#39;s healthy 
arm. Suddenly the young violinist was very unsure as Haruka didn&#39;t 
reply anything. She just stood there. Motionless. Staring down at the 
motor bike as if she had seen a ghost. &quot;I know you went through hell 
and I know that driving your motor bike was only a chance to escape 
reality. But you loved to race through the arena. To race along the 
beach. Can you remember the first time we met? You almost crashed into 
me with that Suzuki and even if you hate it now, I am sure you&#39;ll 
enjoy a ride on her in some years.&quot; Michiru sighed slightly and 
lowered her head. Once it had been a good idea. But that had been 
before the attack of Haruka&#39;s father. Now after the horrible day at 
court she wasn&#39;t sure any longer if Haruka wasn&#39;t even more hurt by 
her gift than delighted.

&quot;Gomen.&quot; Whispered Michiru and turned her wheelchair around. &quot;If you 
don&#39;t like it then sell it. We can buy another gift for you.&quot; As she 
wanted to roll over to the living-room she felt two arms who embraced 
her from behind. Haruka leaned her head against Michiru&#39;s and held her 
tight.

&quot;Arigato, Michi-chan.&quot; Replied the young racer and gave her a light 
kiss an the now pale cheeks. &quot;But give me a little more time.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got as much time as you need.&quot; Michiru smiled again and raised 
her hands to ran them through the short blonde hairs. &quot;But in the 
meantime we should eat our dinner before it&#39;s frozen.&quot;

Haruka closed her eyes and enjoyed the feeling of having her Michiru 
near beside her.

&quot;Good idea. But there&#39;s something I have to do before.&quot; Declared the 
young racer quietly and leaned lightly forward.

&quot;And that is?&quot; Michiru raised one eyebrow but a curious smile laid on 
her again happy face.

&quot;To kiss you.&quot; Laughed Haruka and took her girlfriend into their 
strong arms. Both eyes were closed as their lips met and there was no 
word spoken in the next half hour.

***

&quot;But only five minutes!&quot;

She heard the familiar voice and frowned without opening her eyes. It 
was seldom that Kaori, her father&#39;s assistant, looked after her before 
dawn. The door was closed and she sighed deeply. Her whole body hurt 
and her head was going to explode. She was used to her attacks but 
this one had been one of the worst until the last half year. Her 
father looked very concerned down at her but he couldn&#39;t help her. Not 
really. All those pain killers couldn&#39;t help her for long. The pain 
increased and slowly it became resistant against the medicine. Those 
bitter pills she had to eat regularly.

&quot;Himme-chan?&quot; She heard another voice. It was so different from 
Kaori&#39;s. So warm. So full of love.

&quot;Michiru?&quot; whispered the little girl and opened her eyes. The room was 
dark. Of course it was dark. The curtains hung before the windows and 
dispelled all day&#39;s light. Hotaru couldn&#39;t held back a sob as she saw 
the older girl sitting next to her bed. 

Is this only a nice dream that will be gone when I&#39;ll awake?

The little girl reached her hands towards the young violinist and 
automatically winced as she felt the soft fingers that touched her 
cold skin.

As if my body was already dead...

&quot;Why are you here?&quot; asked Hotaru and coughed. Her whole body trembled 
with a sudden and she felt as if she burned under her icy skin.

&quot;We heard of your attack and wanted to cheer you up.&quot; Answered another 
voice and Hotaru felt how someone sat down on the other side of the 
bed. She turned her head and looked with her big dark eyes at the 
grinning tomboy.

&quot;That&#39;s for you.&quot; Haruka laid down a small present and helped the 
little girl to sat upright in the bed. Hotaru leaned exhausted against 
her pillow but a thin smile laid on her face that was almost as white 
as the wall behind her.

&quot;A card play?&quot; whispered Hotaru and her matt eyes shimmered a bit as 
her fingers touched the new cards. &quot;How could you know that I always 
wanted to have such a play? Kaori said that I am too old for it.&quot; 
Declared the little girl and observed the joker.

&quot;Your father gave us that tip.&quot; Haruka couldn&#39;t resist and stroke over 
the shoulder long dark hairs. They were sweaty but they still felt 
like velvet.

Something is strange about this girl I can&#39;t define.

The young racer swallowed hard as she saw the plasters covering the 
tiny arms. Certainly there were wound of injections under them. The 
little girl was too slim and looked very ill. But her eyes shone as 
she laid down one card by the next one on the blanket.

I don&#39;t know what I should think about her. But I know for sure that I 
love her.

Haruka frowned but her hand kept stroking.

But it&#39;s a different love than the one I feel for my Michi-chan.

&quot;Arigato...&quot; whispered Hotaru and smiled at them both. Her smile faded 
surprised as she saw the huge yellow dragon that sat on Michiru&#39;s lap.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve almost forgotten. That&#39;s a magic dragon. He&#39;ll care for you 
when you&#39;re feeling ill.&quot; Declared Michiru and laid the dragon in 
Hotaru suddenly trembling hands.

&quot;I knew it.&quot; Whispered the girl and big tears run down her cheeks. 
&quot;You were saying goodbye. Why else should you have visited me? People 
only talk to me to say goodbye or to say that there is no other 
way...&quot; declared Hotaru and looked a lot older than her eight years as 
she lowered her head. She couldn&#39;t hold back her sobs and some cards 
fell on the carpet as she brought her legs up to her chest. It was a 
protective gesture and it broke Haruka and Michiru almost their 
hearts. Silently the two older girls exchanged glances. Then Michiru 
reached over to the girl and pulled her on her lap. Hotaru didn&#39;t 
defend. She just sat there and cried desperately.

&quot;Himme-chan...&quot; whispered the young violinist and kissed gently 
Hotaru&#39;s sweaty forehead. &quot;We won&#39;t leave you. We are your friends - 
as long as we live. We just heard of your attack and wanted to cheer 
you up.&quot;

&quot;The dragon was my idea. I have a teddy bear myself and it&#39;s my best 
friend - besides my Michi-chan, of course.&quot; Declared Haruka and 
stepped over to the wheelchair. &quot;But if you don&#39;t want it...&quot;

&quot;I like it.&quot; Sobbed the little girl and looked up with such a 
desperate look that hurt Haruka deeply. &quot;But I don&#39;t wanna any 
substitutes any more.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you can keep it.&quot; Haruka went automatically on her knees 
besides the wheelchair and looked loving into two serious black eyes. 
&quot;And we&#39;re your friends. We don&#39;t leave you.&quot; She didn&#39;t know why she 
promised such a strange promise. She hardly knew the little girl but 
it felt as if she belonged to her. To her and to Michiru.

&quot;And know stop crying, dear.&quot; Whispered the young violinist and 
squeezed the little girl on her leap tenderly. &quot;There are many reasons 
for crying. But there&#39;s no reason at the moment.&quot;

Hotaru looked up at her and nodded bravely. Then she wrapped her arms 
around Michiru&#39;s neck and leaned her head against the warm shoulder. 
Here she felt save and secure. The little girl smiled and the tears 
dried on her cheeks as she felt those strong hands again that stroke 
carefully through her dark hairs.

&quot;I love you.&quot; Whispered the little girl honestly and wished this 
moment to stay forever. Never to end. To become reality for the rest 
of her life.

Haruka-papa.

Michiru-mama.

The two older girls smiled loving at Hotaru.

&quot;We love you, too.&quot; It was not more than a whisper but it was all the 
little girl had ever dreamed of.

Himme-chan.

They stayed until dawn and when they left Hotaru knew that they would 
return.
