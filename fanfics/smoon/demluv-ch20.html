  Rei looked shyly at Usagi&#39;s upturned face that 
lay on her breast at length. 
  &quot;Um, Usa, would you play something for me 
on... your guitar?&quot; She asked hesitantly. 
  Usagi knew Rei was aware of the fact her 
Mother&#39;s guitar was the only one left behind. 
She studied Rei&#39;s features carefully. 
  &quot;Are you sure, precious?&quot; Rei nodded slowly 
and swallowed a lump that rose in her throat. 
  Usagi kissed her briefly. 
  &quot;I&#39;ll be right back, love.&quot; Usagi said and got 
up off her mate with a smile. Usagi picked the 
abandoned jewelry up off the floor to go put 
them away.
  Rei watched as her exquisite naked form 
disappeared into the hallway and turned into the 
room with the benjo in it.
  Rei thought that wasn&#39;t such a bad idea and 
ran into her room to her private bathroom. When 
Rei came out she could hear Usagi tune her 
guitar in her room. Rei slipped back into the 
fire room and tended to the fire before it died 
completely.
  Usagi&#39;s breath caught in her throat upon 
seeing her lover kneeling naked before the fire. 
She was totally taken, once again, by Rei&#39;s 
sheer beauty, power, and gracefulness. 
  Usagi walked into the room with the weathered 
guitar case. She pulled the futon against the 
wall, set her guitar down next to it, then went 
and grabbed some pillows and some quilts out of 
the hall closet. 
  When she returned with her armload, Rei lay 
upon the futon... in all her magnificence. 
  Usagi&#39;s knees felt weak and she crumpled to 
them next to Rei and barely breathed.
  &quot;You are so gorgeous, Rei!&quot; Usagi whispered 
with an ache in her voice. She locked her lips 
onto Rei&#39;s seductive ones. 
  Rei&#39;s eyes moistened with Usagi&#39;s display of 
tenderness and love. She grasped Usagi&#39;s 
shoulders and gently pushed her far enough away 
to take in the fine, delicate, facial features, 
and look into those eternally blue sapphire 
eyes.
  &quot;And your angelic loveliness blinds me and 
leaves me wanting for breath.&quot; Rei said with 
certainty. 
  She cradled Usagi&#39;s angelic face and kissed 
her lips warmly. 
  &quot;You make me feel so alive, so loved, and so 
incredibly, deliriously... happy! I would be 
honored if you would tell me how you feel about 
me... with music.&quot; Rei smiled at her beloved. 
  Usagi absolutely melted inside.
  Usagi propped herself up against the wall and 
stretched her long shapely legs out. Usagi 
placed the refurbished guitar across her thighs. 
  Rei sucked her breath in suddenly. 
  &quot;Usagi my mo... your guitar is beautiful!&quot; 
  Usagi grinned infectiously. 
  &quot;Yes, your mother&#39;s guitar is a beautiful 
instrument. I hope to bring you happiness with 
it and create new memories for you. Your mother 
loved you, Rei, and she wanted you to find joy 
in something that gave her joy.&quot; Usagi said 
quietly. 
  &quot;I intend to help her... help you.&quot;
  Rei&#39;s hand trembled as she reached over and 
touched the Kohno with tears in her eyes. Usagi 
clasped it, and squeezed it gently before she 
drew it up for a kiss. 
  &quot;Thank you, my love.&quot; Rei smiled back at her.
  Rei put a pillow under Usagi&#39;s knees, and 
another on her lower lap then laid her head on 
top of it. She faced Usagi, and drew her own 
knees up and got comfortable. 
  Usagi stroked Rei&#39;s raven bangs from her eyes 
with her fingertips. 
  &quot;This first song, is written, composed, sung 
and played by Meredith Brooks. It reminds me of 
some of the things you&#39;ve had to overcome as you 
grew up. It&#39;s called &#39;Nobody&#39;s Home&#39;.

She can talk for hours 
Words don&#39;t cover her scars  
She thinks she&#39;s crazy 
They just pushed her too far  
She runs to the mirror 
Only savior she&#39;s known   
Another slap on her face 
&#39;Cuz nobody&#39;s home

Her mother&#39;s always working 
Slinging beer on the side  
Daddy&#39;s watching TV 
And he&#39;s still getting high  
She knows he&#39;ll be waiting 
Tryin&#39; to get her alone  
She hangs out on the corner 
Hopin&#39; nobody&#39;s home  
Prayin&#39; nobody&#39;s home

Chorus: 
All she ever wanted 
Was a place on this earth  
She shouts for a savior 
Or anyone who&#39;ll hear her  
All she ever needed 
Was hope in a world  
In a world where she feels all alone 
Nobody&#39;s home 

A cry for attention 
Hanging on by a thread  
She can&#39;t stop the screaming 
Going on in her head  
Tears on the pillow 
These are things she won&#39;t miss  
Nothing to believe in 
So it comes down to this  
Blood on the mirror 
Temptation is bliss  
Pills on the table 
She just couldn&#39;t resist  
Now nobody&#39;s home

Chorus: 
All she ever wanted 
Was a place on this earth  
She shouts for a savior 
Or anyone who&#39;ll here her  
All she ever needed 
Was hope in a world  
In a world where she feels all alone 
Nobody&#39;s home

  Rei&#39;s jaw quivered, but she hadn&#39;t wet her 
pillow. 
  Usagi wiped a tear from her own eye, though. 
She cleared her throat.
  &quot;This one is to let you know my love for you 
never stopped. The music and lyrics are written, 
played, and sung by Polly Jean Harvey. It&#39;s 
called &#39;One Line&#39;.

Do you remember the first kiss? 
Stars shooting across the sky  
To come to such a place as this 
You never left my mind 

I&#39;m watching from the wall 
As in the streets we fight  
This world all gone to war 
All I need is you tonight

Chorus: 
And I draw a line 
To your heart today  
To your heart from mine 
A line to keep us safe

All through the rising sun 
All through the circling years  
You were the only one 
Who could have brought me here 

Chorus: 
And I draw a line 
To your heart today  
To your heart from mine 
One line to keep us safe
And I draw a line 
To your heart today  
To your heart from mine 
And pray to keep us safe

Watch the stars how moving 
Across the sky  
Keep this feeling 
Safe tonight ...

  Rei smiled a little through moist eyes when 
Usagi finished. Usagi drew her lips up in a 
droll expression.
  &quot;This one is to let you know how I&#39;ll feel a 
thousand years from now. It&#39;s written, composed, 
sung and played by Melissa Etheridge. It&#39;s 
called &#39;Sleep&#39;.

after your laughter like thunder 
after your skin like coffee and cream  
after it takes our bodies into the night 
after we&#39;ve come to the extreme

Chorus:
I want to lay down on your shoulder  
just inside your arm 
I want to listen to your heart beat 
and your breathing on and on 
I want to lay down on your shoulder 
surrender to your peace 
and go to sleep

after we&#39;ve gone a million miles 
made true our dreams with sweat and bone 
after we&#39;ve built it up with our bare hands 
made strong a place we can call home

Chorus:
I want to lay down on your shoulder
just inside your arm
I want to listen to your heart beat
and your breathing on and on
I want to lay down on your shoulder
surrender to the peace
and just go to sleep

and when the light in my eye is fading 
when running water becomes too deep 
finally angels turn my fire to dust 
and when my soul&#39;s no longer mine to keep

Chorus:
I want to lay down on your shoulder 
just inside your arm 
I want to listen to your heart beat 
and your breathing on and on 
I want to lay down on your shoulder 
surrender to the peace 
and just go to sleep 
just go to sleep
   
  Usagi played a couple of her own songs, then 
put her guitar back into it&#39;s battered case. Rei 
appeared to be asleep. Her midnight tresses had 
fallen across her face, her bangs were in her 
closed eyes again, and the pillow was wet. Usagi 
smiled inwardly. I guess my music can lull 
someone to sleep better than homework! 
  Usagi pushed Rei&#39;s hair over her left 
shoulder, and used a finger to tidy the bangs 
out of her eyes. She took Rei&#39;s calloused left 
hand in her own and drew it to her lips to kiss. 
  She sighed.
  &quot;What am I going to do with you, sleepyhead, 
I&#39;m trapped!&quot; 
  Usagi lifted the pillow heavy with Rei&#39;s head, 
and scooted out from under it, and made her 
escape. Usagi went to Rei&#39;s bathroom where her 
toothbrush was. Rei&#39;s was already wet, sly dog. 
When she got back to the fire room Rei had 
uncurled her 5&#39;-11&quot; body. Her legs hung 
pitifully over the side of the futon. 
  Usagi snickered, crawled into the bed, lifted 
Rei up and put her lengthwise on the futon. 
  Rei roused slightly. 
  Usagi plunked a pillow down next to Rei&#39;s, 
gathered the quilts to cover them, and lay down.
  Rei snuggled close to her and murmured 
sleepily. 
  &quot;Thank you for sharing your heart, Usa.&quot; She 
paused, &quot; ...I think we should tell Grandpa 
about us when he gets back the day after 
tomorrow, Usa...&quot;
  Usagi nodded in agreement. 
  &quot;I think so, too. I don&#39;t think we&#39;d be able 
hide it from him anyway. I don&#39;t intend to sleep 
alone ever again. The public is another matter 
entirely, however. 
  Though Mako and Ami have never said anything, 
I think they have bonded, too in retrospect, 
because of the way they fight... there seems to 
be a mental connection. I don&#39;t care... I&#39;m all 
for the preservation of one another as long as 
their duty to me isn&#39;t jeopardized. If they are 
lovers, I think we should try to be as 
circumspect as they are in public. All of us 
should certainly be used to a life of secrecy!
  If any of my senshi asks me about us directly, 
I won&#39;t deny it, and, you don&#39;t need to either. 
Mamoru already knows, because I had to ask his 
permission to go ahead with our bond. I felt his 
approval as we completed our bond ceremony.&quot; 
  Usagi leaned in to share a kiss and got it. 
Then she gave Rei a synopses of all the ideas 
shared the day she broke up with Mamoru.
  Rei agreed a major senshi meeting was in 
order, then they both rested in quiet 
pensiveness for a spell. 
  &quot;Angel...?&quot; Rei began.
  &quot;Hmmm?&quot; Usagi prompted.
  Rei looked at her through eyelids that drooped 
sleepily. 
  &quot;Can we go see Meredith in concert if she 
tours in Japan?&quot;
  Usagi looked at Rei in amusement. 
  &quot;Wild youma couldn&#39;t keep me away! But you&#39;ll 
have to wait in a nasty long line, so I can have 
her autograph my &#39;52 Telecaster. 
  You know, we can go see Heart in a few months. 
I always wanted to be Nancy Wilson when I grew 
up! I think I&#39;ll bring my Takamine for her to 
sign... &quot; 
  Rei&#39;s eyes popped open. 
  &quot;You wouldn&#39;t dare bring that thing to a 
concert with you!&quot;
  Usagi rolled her eyes. 
  &quot;I would. Oh Rei, I&#39;ll never fit into your 
square little world!&quot;
  Rei grinned at her lover. 
  &quot;Oh, I think my world has gotten a whole lot 
rounder, and you fit perfectly in it.&quot; 
  Rei kissed Usagi deeply, and took both of 
their breaths away.
  Usagi closed her eyes, and sighed contentedly 
as she nestled contentedly into the crook of 
Rei&#39;s arm, her head upon Rei&#39;s shoulder. 
  After a few minutes of comfortable silence, 
Rei covered Usagi&#39;s right hand that lay on her 
left breast with her own.
  &quot;Do you think my baby grand piano will fit 
into my subspace pocket?&quot;
  Usagi&#39;s eyes popped open, &quot;NANI??&quot;

Author&#39;s Note: 
  My story is left open-ended because only 
Emporess knows what her characters will do. She 
owns Valka, Dagon, Mikel, Aradia, Celeste (my 
favorite character), The Scrolls of Toro, and 
The Gate Keeper. My story is a direct result of 
impatience, and ideas I&#39;ve kicked around for a 
long time.
  For those special readers who have experienced
my portrayal of Rei&#39;s past, I pray you have 
found peace, and your own &#39;shugotenshi&#39;.

it.
  To Chris Davies, whose vision of Mars can&#39;t be
ignored. 
  To my family, whom I shamefully ignored while 
I wrote this.
  To the readers, who slogged through my first
