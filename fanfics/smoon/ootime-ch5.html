<a href="../smoon/ootime-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>THE QUEEN AND THE FIRE  

The night was growing colder, the snow stopped for a while, and a 
strong current of air coming from the ocean wiped away the clouds 
lingering on the  sky, leaving the moon exposed in all its splendor. 
The girls were on Rei&#39;s  room, talking in whispers not to wake the 
priestess&#39; grandfather up, looking  at each other in a whole new way.  

&quot;you know...I lied to you about Darien tonight.&quot; Usagi was looking 
through  the window, like she was talking to the moon itself. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know what&#39;s  wrong with me, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m in love with him at all. 
...I just...don&#39;t  know what to do about it&quot; 

Rei was looking at her with eyes full of love, she knew she could do 
that  when Usagi couldn&#39;t see her. &quot;You don&#39;t have to be with anyone 
you don&#39;t want to, Usagi. Don&#39;t feel the pressure of the kingdom over 
your shoulders  in that way, you have to be happy, and live your life 
with freedom, no  matter what...&quot; 

She twisted a curl of blond hair in her finger, and kept in silence.  

&#39;She looks so fragile&#39; thought Rei, while moving towards Usagi and 
wrapping  her arms around her. They were beside the window, both on 
their knees,  leaning over each other. 

In a whisper she said &quot; I wish I could do something to help you 
Usagi...I&#39;m harsh with you sometimes, but I&#39;d do anything for  you... 
do you know that?&quot;  Her warm breath caressed her ear with every word.  
She couldn&#39;t see her eyes, but she could feel her gaze. And again, 
that  feeling of vertigo in her chest making her whole body ache 
everytime her heart would beat. 

Usagi turned to see her priestess face. It was glowing with  beauty 
and devotion. Moving slowly and without taking her eyes from Rei&#39;s,  
she put her hand on her chin, and softly pull her close to her lips... 
and she kissed her. 

Her scent was sweet and intoxicating, a jasmine breeze  bringing 
memories of summer, her skin was pale and soft, and she could feel  
her heart pounding hard when she placed her hand on her neck. She 
caressed  her upper lip with hers, then she placed a soft kiss on the 
corner of her  mouth. 

Rei had her eyes closed, letting the blonde surround her with love,  
her body motionless, as if she was trying not to break the spell. She 
shyly  kissed her back, with a light gentle touch, and put her arm 
around her  waist. 

Usagi  slowly open her mouth, getting closer to her body, and Rei 
imitated her, feeling her warm sweet breath touching her mouth. Their  
bodies got closer, and the kiss grew deeper, as they felt confident of 
the  feelings of the other. Rei&#39;s mouth was incredibly smooth and 
welcoming. 

She  tasted her. It was overwhelming, and when she felt the shape of 
her  beautiful body slightly rubbing against her, slowly following the 
rhythm of  the kiss, she realized this was the most romantic moment of 
her life. The  perfect place, the perfect one. Outside the shrine, the 
moon grew brighter and a red shade covered all its  surface. It was a 
beautiful red moon.  </pre>
