  By Monday, Usagi&#39;s fever had broken and when 
Ikuko let Dr. Wakai in to examine her daughter, 
she was given a clean bill of health. Usagi had 
sustained some damage, but the doctor informed 
them she didn&#39;t think her scars would cause 
infertility. 
  Dr. Wakai had also been satisfied that her 
boyfriend had gotten help. Dr. Meioh had called 
late Saturday afternoon, and agreed to take his 
case. She had already met with him.
  All in all, if you considered how ill she had 
been, a week was a relatively short recovery 
time. She tired easily and still had a cough, 
but she was up and around. Ikuko thought it was 
nice to hear the girls &#39;jam&#39; on the piano and 
guitars. 
  It was after Usagi&#39;s fever broke that Rei 
approached her about the strange &#39;Silver 
Millennium&#39; box which tickled her ambitious 
imagination.
  &quot;Usagi, what&#39;s in that old metal box?&quot;
  Usagi looked up from the stack of homework she 
had to make up, &quot;I don&#39;t know... I can&#39;t open 
it. My Mother only mentioned to me, that there&#39;s 
some sort of magical voice-activated lock on it. 
I haven&#39;t figured out what it is, yet.&quot;
  Rei picked it up curiously. It looked heavy, 
but it was surprisingly lightweight. &quot;I have an 
idea, it probably activates by naming one of 
your powers.&quot;
  Usagi returned her attention back to her text 
book and scrawled something in her notebook, and 
mumbled, &quot;Nope. Tried that.&quot; She said, as she 
continued to write.
   Rei was persistent, &quot;How about someone 
else&#39;s? Someone you trusted and wouldn&#39;t have 
minded if they looked in it?&quot;
  Usagi didn&#39;t look up, but her pen paused as 
she grumbled, &quot;Nope, didn&#39;t try that.&quot;
  Quietly Rei uttered the words, &#39;Fire Soul&#39;. 
The box&#39;s lid suddenly sprang to life and 
opened.
  Rei grinned gleefully and Usagi gasped. She 
scooted over on the bed to sit next to Rei. They 
both looked in amazement at the boxes&#39; contents. 
  There was a thick diary, a thin journal, a 
beautiful Martian dagger, a small vial of 
Venusian perfume, a Jupitan music box, and a 
Mercurian chronometer. Evidently the box was 
filled with prenuptial gifts for the Princess 
Serenity from the inner senshi. Usagi&#39;s eyes 
watered.
  Usagi picked up the perfume and uncapped it. 
It&#39;s fresh, clean smell was intoxicating. She 
passed it under Rei&#39;s nose whose only response 
was &#39;whoa&#39;! 
  Usagi put the ornate cap back on. &quot;Knowing 
Venus, if I were to put some of this on, every 
male within a 10 mile radius would be at my 
doorstep!&quot;  Rei giggled at her friend&#39;s logic.
  Usagi next took out the timepiece and glanced 
at her alarm clock, which was set to the time 
displayed on her computer monitor. The Mercurian 
chronometer reflected the exact same time. 
  &quot;That&#39;s scary, Rei. I&#39;ll bet that no matter 
wherever or whenever I am in the universe, it 
will keep real-time.&quot;
  Usagi gently lifted out the small music box 
that looked as if it had been laser-designed. 
When she touched the box, it immediately began 
to play what was in Usagi&#39;s mind. It was her 
newest music piece. Both girls were in shock. 
Usagi thought of different pieces, which 
included some of Michiru&#39;s more complicated 
ones. The box played them all flawlessly. She 
handed the box to Rei, and it became silent. 
Sugoi!
  Last of all was the gorgeous dagger. When 
Usagi&#39;s hand closed around the hilt, her eyes 
widened... &quot;Rei, it sang to me!&quot;
  Rei was enthused, &quot;Listen carefully to it&#39;s 
song to you... listen for its name.&quot;
  Usagi&#39;s eyes were closed as she concentrated. 
She raised it high in the air above her head and 
whispered &#39;Exavyre&#39; (ex-zavier). The dagger 
lengthened to became a perfectly balanced, 
double-edged broadsword that was the perfect 
weight for her. 
  Usagi slashed through the air with it, to feel 
its response. It sang joyfully to her in ancient 
Lunarian. 
  &quot;Oh, Rei! Thank you, it&#39;s breathtaking! What 
does its name mean in Martian?&quot; She asked.
  Rei let the breath out she had been holding 
during the spectacle. 
  &quot;Um, it means &#39;The God&#39;s Help&#39;. It... it was 
forged by Hephaestus. Diana... I... had him make 
it especially for my Moon Princess... you. I 
think you&#39;ll find that each of us had these 
gifts forged magically by a god of our own 
choice, and they are designed to help you 
specifically,&quot; Rei smiled, &quot;that includes the 
perfume.&quot;
  Usagi put the chronometer and Exavyre into her 
subspace pocket. She got up and put the perfume 
and music box on her dresser. 
  She settled back down on the bed next to Rei 
and picked up the old diary carefully, homework 
forgotten. Rei leaned her head on Usagi&#39;s 
shoulder and watched as she flipped through the 
thick diary. It was written in formal Lunarian 
tongue, but they both could read it.
  &quot;Wait, Usagi, here&#39;s when you first met me!&quot; 
Rei interrupted enthusiastically. They read for 
a while in silence, until Rei&#39;s breath sucked in 
suddenly, and Usagi blushed. 
  &quot;That&#39;s some pretty explicit stuff you wrote 
about us during our trip home to the Moon 
Kingdom, Usagi. I can&#39;t believe we were only 
fourteen!&quot; Rei remarked in shock.
  &quot;I tried to tell you that I have loved you 
forever, Rei. Do you believe me, yet?&quot; 
Usagi said, unabashed.  
  Rei squeezed Usagi tight, then cupped Usagi&#39;s 
face between her hands and kissed her lips most 
tenderly. 
  &quot;Hai, my love, I do!&quot; 
  Usagi flipped through a couple more pages, 
until Rei stopped her again and giggled. She 
pointed at something about mid-page.
  &quot;It say&#39;s here, you woke all of us up at 2am 
in the morning for an &#39;impromptu senshi meeting&#39; 
in the palace kitchens. You had craved cookies 
for a week, and your mother always said &#39;no&#39; 
when you asked her for them, and handed you 
carrots to eat. 
  So you convinced Mako you were desperate, and 
the middle of the night was the only time you 
could get away with eating them. 
  Then you decided you couldn&#39;t even wait for 
the cookies to bake, so you had me &#39;cook&#39; some 
dough on the sly. Unfortunately, when Mako 
caught us, it was a rather &#39;shocking&#39; 
experience!&quot; 
  Usagi winked at her.
  &quot;I guess we don&#39;t need an oven to cook, ne 
Rei?&quot;
  Rei returned the wink. 
  &quot;Nope!&quot;
  They read a few more pages and Usagi remarked, 
&quot;It would appear we all had a lot of fun 
together back then, too, just like we do now. 
Let&#39;s see what&#39;s in this other book. It looks 
like it&#39;s yours, Rei.  
  Look, it&#39;s written it in the Queen&#39;s Martian 
tongue. It&#39;s by &#39;the honored royal huntress&#39;. I 
think it&#39;s Diana&#39;s hunt journal, Rei! 
  As Lunarian Princess, I had to learn all the 
languages of our allies, but I&#39;d feel privileged 
if you would read it to me, please, Rei.&quot; 
Usagi&#39;s eyes begged.
  &quot;Oh ok, royal pain-in-the neck Princess.&quot; 
  Rei took it gingerly from Usagi and scanned 
through the book. Her countenance changed and 
the pages moved more slowly. Rei swallowed hard 
and cleared her throat.
  &quot;Most of these entries are technical notes, 
but there are a few personal events 
described...&quot; Rei began.
  &quot;It seems the Hunt Leader was jealous of my 
superior tracking abilities and more accurate 
shooting abilities. He was particularly hard on 
me. 
  It seems I did know Jadeite before I came to 
the Moon kingdom. He was far and away the best 
male hunter and he was good with the 
organization of task forces. We stayed alive 
largely because of his great instincts. At 14 he 
became second leader. He always defended me from 
our first leader&#39;s abuse. He slept near me to 
keep watch over me wherever we stopped... 
usually in old wyrm trenches, caves, or tunnels.
  One day, while we were in fast pursuit of a 
particularly large prey, Jadeite saw him lash 
out at my dromedyre (a wooly Martian dromedary). 
He purposely caused it to stumble, and my 
spear&#39;s aim faltered, and I missed the wyrm. 
Somebody was killed by the wyrm&#39;s terrible spew 
of acids. I was injured badly as I was flung off 
my dromedyre and into the hooves of the frenzied 
herd of dromedyre. The thick wyrm-hide armor I 
wore, saved my life.
  Jadeite was in a rare rage and beat our leader 
senseless with his bare fists. I guess he loved 
me. I was too young to have any reciprocation of 
that nature. I was only eleven at the time. One 
of my many sisters pulled Jadeite off our leader 
before he killed him. 
  Jadeite was sent to Earth to be trained as one 
of Prince Endymion&#39;s bodyguards. The Hunt Leader 
was torched by my illustrious Queen Mother, and 
replaced.
  I was never called into her presence until the 
day we met three years later. I fell in love 
with you, and grew closer to you as you cleaned 
me, tended my wounds and airsickness, then you
taught me proper Lunarian etiquette. It seemed I 
preferred a Martian dromedyre to flight!&quot; Rei 
snapped the journal shut. &quot;Let&#39;s read more of 
yours, it&#39;s more fun!&quot;
  The girls lay on their stomachs side by side 
and enjoyed their nostalgia until Usagi grew 
tired. Usagi put the books back into the not so 
mysterious box, and slid it under her bed. 
  That night, they shared sweet kisses and slept 
in each other&#39;s arms. They both dreamt about the 
days of yesteryear, and what was to come.
