<h1>Darkness (part 9 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Rei cradled Serena&#39;s head to the crook of her neck and got themselves 
comfortable. Rei sighed and closed her eyes. She kind of felt at peace 
having Serena in her arms, but the thought went as soon as came. Rei 
let one more sigh escape her mouth before she went to sleep.

Suddenly the bedroom door was thrown open as Amara and Michelle ran in 
looking frantic. They didn&#39;t notice that Rei and Serena was in the 
same bed or Amara would have made a comment.

Amara ran to Rei and Serena roughly picked them as did Michelle did to 
Hotaru. Serena popped her eyes opened as she picked up by Amara. She 
looked over to Rei and Hotaru who were looking around confused.

&quot;Amara-papa, what&#39;s going on?&quot;, asked Serena.

&quot;There&#39;s an a attack. The slayers found us and we need to leave.&quot;, 
said Amara as she ran down the halls with Michelle.

We passed by the main hallway and saw tons of slayers. They were 
killing vampires from left to right. I felt my eyes widened as I saw 
the one that killed my daddy.

The ebony black hair and blue eyes. I stared at him as we left the 
building. We were tossed in the black car that we were in for our 
hunt.

Amara and Michelle jumped into the front seat and quickly started the 
car. I turned around in my seat as I saw the slayers set the layer on 
fire and kill the vampires. Even the children.

I watched with disgust as I saw a slayer killer a mother protecting 
her child and than turn around and killed the child. My eyes burned 
with hatred and my seek of revenged burned deeply inside my heart.

I turned to Rei who watched with wide eyes and Hotaru who had tears in 
her eyes. We group up with those people and we watched them die 
mercilessly.

I felt the car jerk forward as Amara sped the car forward. All of us 
turned back around in our seats sadly. Rei held onto her sister Hotaru 
who was crying. I reached over and put my hand onto Rei&#39;s shoulder who 
wasn&#39;t in a better state than her sister.

Rei leaned into me as she pulled her sister onto her lap. I wrapped my 
arm around her shoulder as she put her head on my shoulder. I sighed 
as I began to look out the window.

After a while I felt a pair of eyes on me and I looked forward to see 
Michelle looking at me. I smiled at her and she returned it before she 
turned back around in her seat.

I looked down at Rei who was sleeping as was Hotaru who was on her 
lap. Throughout the whole ride I stared at the two girls I began to 
love as my family.

The car came to a stop and we seemed to be at another layer. Amara got 
out of the car as did Michelle. Michelle grabbed Hotaru as Amara 
grabbed Rei and I held onto Amara&#39;s free hand.

We all walked up to a door and Michelle knocked on the door. A couple 
of minutes passed and a woman came to the door. She was tall and had 
long black hair with green high lights. She also had the strangest red 
eyes that showed that she had seen things that no one should ever see.

She invited us in warmly and let us into a living room which had a 
fire burning in the fire place. Amara and Michelle shook Hotaru and 
Rei awake as the woman went to get her two daughters.

When the woman returned she held onto to two sleepy girls. One of them 
had light pink hair and the same red eyes as the woman only lacking 
the eeriness. She also looked to be Hotaru&#39;s age which was 9.

The other girl had short blue hair and dark blue eyes. The girl looked 
to be mine and Rei&#39;s age which was 10.

&quot;These are my daughters Rini and Amy.&quot;, said the woman. &quot;My name is 
Setsuna.&quot;

We smiled up at them and greeted them with an hello. The did the same 
and Setsuna set her girls down on the floor.

&quot;Can you two show them to their rooms?&quot;, asked Setsuna. The two girls 
nodded their heads yes. They began walking down the hall and we 
followed them.

After we were out of sight Setsuna, Michelle and Amara began talking 
quietly amongst themselves. No doubt about it being what happened not 
to long ago.

We were showed to our rooms with Hotaru going to Rini&#39;s room and with 
Rei and I going to Amy&#39;s room. Upon seeing the room we noticed that 
there was only two beds. One being Amy&#39;s and the other being mine and 
Rei&#39;s.

Amy climbed into her bed as Rei and I climbed into ours. Amy looked 
towards us before she turned out the lights.

&quot;Night.&quot;, said Amy.

&quot;Night.&quot;, said Rei and I unison.

Rei and I talked for a little as Amy long ago fell asleep. I had my 
hands behind head as Rei laid her head on my chest. I sighed and 
brought out one hand from behind my head and put it around Rei.

I began to brush the bangs from her closed eyes. I watched her for a 
moment taking in her beauty before I to drifted off to sleep.</pre>
