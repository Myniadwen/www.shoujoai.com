<a href="../smoon/saturn-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The first thing Minako noticed upon waking was the sun in her eyes. 
Flinging an arm over her face to block out the offending light, she 
pondered sleepily why it should seem odd to be awakened in such a way.

Because Hotaru always wakes you up after her shift, her brain reminded 
her.

Jolting awake, Minako threw back the covers and looked around the room 
worriedly. &quot;Hotaru-chan?&quot; In all their years together, Hotaru had 
never once returned late from guard duty.

Moments later, servants and nobility alike were diving out of the way 
as Sailor Venus sprinted at breakneck speed through the corridors. In 
mere minutes, she had determined that Saturn was nowhere inside the 
palace. She raced through the gardens, across the courtyard, and up, 
up, up through the high tiers of the outer walls, her golden hair 
streaming behind her. Only when she found herself among the highest 
rooftops of the palace did she pause, sweeping her frantic gaze across 
the myriad spiraling towers where her lover could have perched.

A flash of black against the crystal walls caught her eye. Her gaze 
locked onto it and then she was leaping from tower to tower, heedless 
of her own safety, the only thought in her mind to reach Hotaru. As 
she neared the small tower, she was able to pick out
Saturn&#39;s long glaive catching the morning light. The smaller senshi 
was sitting on the edge of the roof, legs dangling over the side, her 
glaive propped against her shoulder. Her purple eyes looked up when 
Venus arrived but she said nothing. Venus was struck by the sad, 
solemn expression on her face. She longed to pull her friend into a 
warm embrace, but the senshi in her spoke first.

&quot;Sailor Saturn, you were late.&quot; The rising sun cast her shadow over 
the other senshi&#39;s face. &quot;I was worried...&quot; Her voice trembled 
slightly. Didn&#39;t Hotaru realize how important she was to Minako?

&quot;I was just thinking,&quot; Saturn began, her voice so soft that Venus 
almost had to lean closer to hear her. &quot;I was just thinking...about 
Chibiusa.&quot;

&quot;Chibiusa-chan?&quot; Venus was caught by surprise. &quot;That&#39;s right...you 
were good friends with her in the past, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

Turning her face away from Venus, Saturn looked out over the beautiful 
city. &quot;Yes,&quot; she nodded. &quot;I was just thinking how, if things had been 
different, I could have fallen in love with her...instead of...&quot; Her 
voice fell silent, her head bowed. &quot;Instead of...&quot;

Venus knelt beside her, placing a warm, gloved hand on Saturn&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; she said gently. 

Saturn looked up at Venus&#39;s smiling face in surprise. She had expected 
her lover to be hurt, or jealous, or...upset in some way, at least. 
Instead, she was smiling? &quot;M-Minako-chan?&quot;

Venus&#39;s smile widened. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m the senshi of love! Even back then, 
don&#39;t you think I could notice such a thing?&quot; She hugged Saturn 
tightly. &quot;You didn&#39;t choose her, though. You chose me. And Chibiusa 
will have Helios, right?&quot;

Saturn nodded slowly, returning Venus&#39;s embrace.

&quot;I&#39;m glad, Minako-chan,&quot; she said slowly, favoring Venus with one of 
those sweet smiles that senshi of love adored so much, &quot;that you&#39;re 
not upset.&quot;

&quot;Silly,&quot; Venus scoffed. &quot;I couldn&#39;t be upset with you about something 
like that.&quot; She rose and held out her hand. &quot;Let&#39;s go home.&quot;

Blinking back the tears in her eyes, Saturn smiled and took her 
lover&#39;s hand.

----------

The birth of Chibiusa, formally known as Princess Serenity, royal 
daughter to Neo-Queen Serenity and King Endymion of Crystal Tokyo, was 
an event that none would soon forget. 

When the queen went into labor, the entire kingdom flew into a frenzy 
of excitement before finally settling into a tense silence, as the 
world waited with bated breath for the birth of their new princess. 
Endymion paced the halls outside of the royal chambers like a panther. 
When someone (Sailor Mars, perhaps it was) jokingly suggested that he 
should be at the queen&#146;s side, his face first paled and then turned 
several shades of red before he snarled at the offending senshi and 
continued his nervous prowling, muttering occasionally under his 
breath about decency and privacy and senshi responsibilities.

When the doors finally creaked open to reveal Sailor Mercury, a tired 
expression on her kind face, all conversations ceased as dozens of 
pairs of eyes riveted on the shy senshi. Mercury combed a hand through 
her slightly disheveled hair, a small blush staining her cheeks as she 
found herself the center of such intense scrutiny.

&quot;Well?&quot; Endymion demanded, the sharp edge of impatience and worry in 
his voice, &quot;Serenity...is she...?&quot; He took a half-step forward, 
uncertainly.

Mercury smiled, beckoning him forward. &quot;The queen has given birth to a 
beautiful baby girl. She is resting now, but asks to see you.&quot; As 
Endymion hurried through the door, Mercury pulled it shut behind him, 
allowing the royal family some privacy. She exchanged a small, secret 
smile with the other senshi.

Their young friend of the past had finally arrived in the future.

The official presentation of the princess was the following day. 
Endymion and Mercury had both argued that Serenity should rest at 
least two days before attempting such a feat, but the queen was 
adamant. Her rosy cheeks and glowing expression as she held her 
daughter in her arms (as well as the large pillows she lobbed at them) 
finally convinced the two that her strength was fully recovered.

And so the entire palace rose long before dawn the next day, to 
complete the preparations in time for the princess&#146;s debut. As the 
closest advisors and protectors of the royal family, the inner senshi 
wore their standard fukus, while the four outer senshi dressed in 
elegant gowns of their own creation, each somehow reflective of the 
wearer&#146;s rank and ability.

Sailor Neptune appeared in a simple, pale green dress adorned with 
tiny bells which chimed softly at her slightest movement. Sailor 
Uranus wore a sky blue dress of similar style, but without the bells. 
She wore no jewelry or accessories save for an intricate gold 
necklace. (AN: A story for another time?) Even the guardian of time, 
Sailor Pluto, stepped away from her demanding post to appear at 
Chibiusa&#146;s presentation. Her silk gown of deep forest green clung to 
her figure in sharp contrast to the flowing styles of her companion 
senshi.

Sailor Saturn arrived last, having waited in her room in hopes of 
showing off her dress to Minako before the presentation, but the 
leader of the inner senshi had apparently been too caught up in the 
last minute preparations. Her gown was a shimmering purple, overlaid 
with lace, that matched her eyes and managed to bring out what little 
color her skin had. Saturn felt a minor pang that Venus&#146;s devotion to 
her senshi duties prevented her from sparing her lover even a few 
minutes. Pushing those thoughts aside as she neared the others, she 
took her place near the front of the throne room.

An enormous crowd was in attendance for the event. News had never 
spread so quickly and many had previously made plans that could be 
implemented at the spur of the moment to ensure that they were among 
the first to lay eyes on the new princess. Finally, the moment they 
had been waiting for arrived.

The four inner senshi filed in first, taking positions on either side 
of the great crystal throne. The crowd quieted at the appearance of 
the royal guardians, a respectful but excitement-filled silence 
spreading swiftly through the enormous room.

At last, the queen appeared. Held close by King Endymion, her arms 
cradling her precious bundle, Serenity wore a beatific smile. The 
straining eyes of the crowd took in the picture of the royal family 
and a collective sigh of contentment and happiness rose from gathered 
masses, as if the mood of their leaders was infectious. Taking the 
child into his arms, Endymion stepped forward.

&quot;Good people,&quot; he began, his voice echoing over the audience, &quot;today 
marks a most momentous occasion.&quot; He gently held up the baby in his 
arms. &quot;Today I bring you the child that your queen has presented me 
with. I bring you my daughter, Princess Serenity of Crystal Tokyo!&quot; 
His words were met with tumultuous applause as the crowd roared its 
joy and approval.

Startled by the noise, the child stirred in the king&#146;s arms, opening 
wine-red eyes to blink about uncertainly. Her gaze flickered about the 
cavernous room and the many people filling it. It brushed curiously 
over the assembled senshi until it reached Sailor Saturn.

Uncomfortable with such a large gathering, the petite senshi had 
withdrawn herself from the crowd to stand near a pillar to one side of 
the royal dais. From the moment the queen had appeared, Saturn&#146;s eyes 
had been locked on the baby Chibiusa, lost in memories of old. Now she 
was startled from her revelries to find the child&#146;s innocent gaze 
staring back at her. Then the princess&#146;s eyes drifted shut and she 
curled against her father&#146;s chest contentedly, oblivious to the rowdy 
audience that was eager to meet her.

Saturn backed into the shadowy corner, overwhelmed with the emotion 
she had felt when her gaze met Chibiusa&#146;s. She had realized then that, 
even after all this time, even with her love for Minako, she still 
loved Chibiusa. Not in a romantic way, but as a sister perhaps. An 
older sister. Saturn smiled softly.

Yes, she would be Chibiusa&#146;s sister. She would make sure that nothing 
ever hurt the princess that had showed her such kindness in the past.

&quot;That&#146;s a lovely dress,&quot; a voice said quietly and Saturn&#146;s eyes darted 
up. Sailor Venus was leaning casually on a nearby pillar, a smile 
tugging at her lips as she watched her lover. She held out her gloved 
hand to Saturn, who took it without hesitation. &quot;You look so 
beautiful,&quot; Venus sighed, pressing a kiss to Saturn&#146;s temple.

The raven-haired senshi felt her cheeks grow warm at Venus&#146;s comment. 
&quot;You always look beautiful, Minako-chan,&quot; she stammered in response. 
&quot;Even in your fuku, you still look like an angel.&quot;

Now it was Venus&#146;s turn to blush. &quot;Oh, Hotaru-chan!&quot; she laughed, 
giving the girl a quick hug, &quot;you&#146;re so good to me. C&#146;mon, the ball is 
starting and I want to dance!&quot; With a small giggle, Saturn let herself 
be pulled forward, out into the noise of the crowd. But with Minako 
there, none of it mattered. 

There is nothing, Saturn thought as Venus pulled her out to the very 
center of the room, that could make me happier than I am now. Still, 
her eyes drifted unwittingly to the delighted king and queen and their 
new daughter.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; she whispered under her breath, before allowing herself to 
be enveloped by the room&#146;s euphoric atmosphere.</pre>
