<p><u>Failing</u></p>
<hr />
<em>Her room is quite plain – no pictures,  cream sheets, a set of drawers and a closet. It’s strange, not at all  like I imagined. Not at all like Minako.</em>
<p>“Mmm, you’re warm.”</p>
<p><em>Oh,  she’s awake. It’s cute how her voice is all hoarse and sleepy. Her body  is quite cool. I think I might have hogged the covers. </em></p>
<p>“Do you know what time it is?”</p>
<p><em>The  sun is coming in brightly through the open curtains and makes reading  the clock’s glowing numbers rather difficult. Her hair tickles me every  time she moves.</em></p>
<p>“10:30 already? Wuhh.”</p>
<p><em>And yet,  funnily enough, she’s making no move to get up. I’ve become a pillow.  Maybe a mattress is more correct. Most mattresses don’t get little  kisses, though.</em></p>
<p>“Let’s just stay in bed all day.”</p>
<p><em>That would be nice. I haven’t slept this well in a while. Shit. I wonder how Grandpa’s cold is doing . . .</em></p>
<p>“We could re-enact last night, which was amazing, by the way.”</p>
<p><em>Last  night . . . I don’t really want to think about. Is that wrong? It seems  wrong – doing something like that and wanting to pretend it never  happened. But I really don’t know what to think. The memory should be  enjoyable, right? I should look forward to doing it again.</em></p>
<p>“How are you feeling? Sleep well?”</p>
<p><em>But  I feel like something bad will happen if I think about it. I wasn’t  supposed to feel this way. This . . . with Minako . . . was supposed to  solve my problems. </em></p>
<p>“Mmm, that’s true, but who needs sleep anyway?”</p>
<p><em>It  wasn’t supposed to take the questions I couldn’t answer and turn them  on their side. Now I don’t even know what to ask myself. And now she’s  getting up and I’m . . . very naked.</em></p>
<p>“I’m going to my room to get changed. Do you want me to bring you something, or are last night’s clothes okay?”</p>
<p><em>Going to her room. We . . . in the </em>guest room<em>?  I guess anywhere will do in a pinch. It’s just a little meaningless  sex, after all. This is laughable. I want to laugh, in fact, but I can  already feel my temper growing. God, I do not want to do this right now.</em></p>
<p>“Rei? Oh. I guess that answers that. I’ll be right back in like two . . . uh, what’s the hurry? Rei?”</p>
<p><em>My  head hurts. Chest feels like it’s going to explode. I feel hot and  chilled, nauseous and so fucking . . . hurt. No, I feel stupid. Good  work, Rei. This has all been a nice bit of self-delusion. </em></p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
Rei  wasn’t taking her calls. Minako hadn’t seen the miko since their spat  The Morning After and it was now Tuesday. She could understand a little  distance after their argument, but skipping class twice and  stonewalling her phone calls?
<p>Minako pouted. She couldn’t even get  mad because she fairly sure that she was to blame. Rei had seemed quite  pissed about sleeping in the guestroom, which Minako had to admit,  wasn’t very smooth.</p>
<p>“We . . . we . . . in the fucking <em>guest bedroom</em>, Minako!” Rei had spat.</p>
<p>“Um,  sorry?” Minako had tried, but Rei’s glare had only deepened. “Oh, come  on. It’s not that big a deal.” And the instant those words were out of  her mouth, she had realised her mistake, but Rei just turned and made  for the door.</p>
<p>“Have fun cleaning up from your party.”</p>
<p>And  then Rei was gone, and Minako was fairly sure she had been avoiding her  since, meaning she couldn’t even apologize. So here she was, sitting at  home, in her room, glancing between the homework in her school bag and  her cell phone on the nightstand.</p>
<p>Her left hand ached to close the distance between itself and the sleek, silver cellular device. <em>Maybe she’s home now. You’ll never know unless you try,</em> it reasoned, twitching its fingers impatiently.</p>
<p><em>Don’t be such an idiot!</em> her right hand, balled into a fist, argued heatedly. <em>If  she hasn’t answered for the past two days, it’s because she doesn’t  want to talk to you, and she’s not going to answer now either. You  could do something productive, like your homework, instead of being so  pathetic.</em> There. The right was certain it had proven its point  quite solidly. Any second now, Minako would get to work and both hands  could cease their useless fidgeting.</p>
<p>Imagine the hands’ surprise when they were both shoved unceremoniously into dark, denim pockets.</p>
<p>“I’m going for a walk. I’ll be back for dinner.”</p>
<p>“Wait, Minako, what –” The concerned voice of Minako’s mother was abruptly terminated by the slamming of the front door.</p>
<p>Now the feet were in charge, and they knew <em>just</em> where to go. They had grown quite tired of all the restless pacing  around lately, and they needed this all to be resolved post-haste! So  they went straight to the source, and froze at the top of the steps.</p>
<p>The  courtyard was strewn with leaves, looking its most unkempt in all  Minako’s visits. But what stopped her in her tracks was the small  billboard just before her.</p>
<p><strong>Hikawa Jinja is closed to the public. We apologize for the inconvenience, and hope to be open again soon.</strong></p>
<p>Rei’s  neat writing was unmistakeable and, coupled with the fact that not a  single light was on in the building, made it quite clear that the  shrine was deserted. Minako wondered if she had driven Rei away  completely.</p>
<p>This was an absurd postulation, so she sat down on  the step and laughed at the ridiculousness of some dumb blonde making  Hino Rei and her grandfather leave town. And then she laughed at how it  was just so Rei to make visitors walk all the way up the stone stairs  in order to read the sign that told them not to bother. Her laughter  turned to tears almost without her noticing. She would have climbed the  stairs even if the sign had been at the bottom, just as she had upon  meeting Rei.</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
Severe dehydration, they told her, caused  by a raging fever, coupled with a common cold had landed Grandpa at the  hospital with a week’s accommodations.
<p>She was so ashamed she could  cry, but tears would only lead to more tears about different failures  and that wasn’t a deluge she was ready to unleash. For now, Rei just  sat stiffly in her chair, facing her Grandpa’s prone, steadily  breathing form on the hospital bed and contemplated the guilt gnawing  at her insides.</p>
<p>He had been doing her chores while she was . . .</p>
<p>The  door to the silent room clicked open and Rei raised her head to see the  doctor enter with a clipboard and give her a polite smile.</p>
<p>“Good  news, Ms Hino,” he informed her in a hushed voice so as not to wake his  patient. “With proper care, your grandfather is expected to make a full  recovery in no time at all.”</p>
<p>Rei nodded. “. . . That’s good. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“He’s  going to need a few more days in the hospital, just so we can get his  fluids back to where they should be. Then he can go home so long as  someone checks in often. He’s going to need one of these,” he held up a  pill bottle and handed it to her, “with breakfast and one with dinner.  Give him plenty of fluids – tea and soup should be easy enough to keep  him on. Call if his temperature starts to go up again, and bring him in  next Sunday so we can see how he’s doing.”</p>
<p>Rei nodded, and put the pills in her bag. “I’ll take good care of him.”</p>
<p>The  doctor eyed her school books sitting on the bedside table. “Are you  sure there aren’t some relatives who can help with this?”</p>
<p>She straightened and eyed him coolly. “Yes, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>He  shook his head. “Don’t get me wrong, I know you’ll do a great job;  you’re very attentive from what I can tell, but missing so much school  . . . well, I have a daughter your age. I have heart palpitations just  thinking about her missing so much class.” The doctor curled the side  of his lips into a wry smile. “Though I suspect kids these days skip  enough as it is.”</p>
<p>“That’s probably true.” Rei managed a small smile in return.</p>
<p>The  doctor left quietly and Rei sat back down, her closed eyes seeing the  day she had opted freedom over class time and the grinning accomplice  who had laughed and danced along beside her the whole way.</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
The  hour of Minako’s doom was upon her, and she couldn’t concentrate any  better at that moment than she had been able to all last week when she  should have been studying. Joy of joys, final exams had come at last.  Minako felt she might be sick.
<p>It was two weeks and three days since Rei had been at school. Not that anyone was counting.</p>
<p>Minako’s  math mark had steadily declined in that time, and she was fairly  positive that this exam, worth nearly their entire final mark, was  going to be the bomb that blew her average straight to hell. Every page  of formulas and notes she had sat down to try and study had run through  her mind in Rei’s voice. Low and clear, bored but confident, her memory  had recreated the sound of the miko’s instructions perfectly. It was  nothing short of torture.</p>
<p>“Please find your seats. The exam is about to commence.”</p>
<p>Minako was already seated, drumming her fingers on the booklet with her name on it. <em>How bad can it be?</em> she wondered, trying to relax herself.</p>
<p>“It is now eight o’clock. You may begin.”</p>
<p><em>Very bad</em>,  was how bad it could be, as it turned out. Three hours later, Minako  was just relieved that it was over and she could go home to turn her  brain off. And then she saw Rei.</p>
<p>Just a figure striding out the  doors from the corner of her eye, but Minako was positive and gave  chase. But of course here were many dark haired girls in the hallway  and Minako lost Rei in the crowd.</p>
<p>She guessed at the miko’s  destination, and took off up a flight of stairs to the hall Rei had  once said her locker was in. There were a handful of students in that  hallway who all looked up at her sudden arrival when she burst up the  flight of stairs, but none of them was Rei.</p>
<p>“Eheheh . . .” Minako smiled apprehensively and marched back the way she came.</p>
<p>She  dwelled on her embarrassment until she reached her bus stop, and then  ruefully realised it had been pointless to run after Rei in the first  place. She didn’t have anything to say to her, really. She would have  ended up staring at the miko, searching for words while Rei, arms  crossed, conveyed her displeasure at being held up through her steely,  violet gaze.</p>
<p>The bus pulled up, and Minako got on, growing more  and more depressed. Rei probably would have been worse than displeased.  She wouldn’t be surprised if Rei hated her. Minako sat on her stiff,  uncomfortable bus seat and thought back to the night of her party to  consider what had happened and finally acknowledged the hesitation in  Rei’s eyes that she had pushed past upon seeing that night. She had  known it wasn’t what the miko was looking for, but had taken the  opportunity as it was offered . . . in the guest bedroom. Rei must have  been convinced she was only after a fling.</p>
<p><em>Were you </em>trying<em> to drive her away?</em> she berated herself. Y<em>ou couldn’t have done better with a bat in your hand, dumbass. </em></p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
The sun was just disappearing behind the trees  beyond the western edge of the courtyard, casting long shadows and  colouring the world a dim orange and muted pink when Rei set her broom  down at its place beside the door. No thoughts or time to spare on the  evening’s tranquility, she entered her home quietly and shut the door  softly behind her.
<p>Grandpa was asleep, had been asleep all day, and  would sleep some more if Rei could keep it that way. With all the  stealth of one who knows every creak and hollow spot in the house, she  padded down the hall and into her grandfather’s bedroom. The room was  quiet and the old man’s face was relaxed, his eyes shut and mouth  cracked open. Rei felt the familiar guilt that appeared when she saw  him in all his frailty, accompanied by relief at his state of  relaxation.</p>
<p>Rei picked up the tray beside his bed, cursing herself silently when the spoon rattled in the empty bowl.</p>
<p>“Rei.”</p>
<p>She looked down. His eyes were still closed but he was undoubtedly awake. “Yes, Grandpa?”</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and coughed for a bit. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
<p>“You make sure you feed yourself too, Rei,” he insisted, slitting an eye open.</p>
<p>She smiled wanly. “I will. Just get better. I’ll come help you up in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Don’t work yourself too hard, either. I can tell you’re stressed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandpa.”</p>
<p>“And  –” He paused to cough, and opened his eyes to look at Rei with a  sternness that disguised his weariness. “Not too much skipping class,  either. Your grades are much too important to your future.”</p>
<p>“I  know. Don’t worry.” She closed the door softly behind her and quietly  set the dishes in the kitchen sink. She rinsed and washed them in a  silence that was broken only by rough coughs and worry beating like a  drum in her chest.</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
She couldn’t place her feet on the  pedals without starting to tip, so Minako chose to forgo traditional  biking techniques in favour of using her feet to propel herself in a  more direct, much sturdier manner. This went very well, left the blonde  feeling delightfully carefree, almost like she was running on air, and  let some wind through her hair when she built up enough speed. And then  she reached the hill. Her attempt to push on resulted in a wonderfully  graceless crash into the asphalt and some nice rashes to remember it  by, so Minako grudgingly extracted herself from her metallic steed and  pushed the beast alongside her as she walked up the incline.
<p>This was  boring. Walking was so outdated. One would think that the new year  might usher in flying cars or something but nooo, here she was, walking  just like people had been doing for a bazillion years.</p>
<p>She got to  the top of the hill, sat down at a bus stop bench and looked dizzily  upward at the stars. Her blissful contemplation of the night sky was  derailed only seconds after it had begun by thoughts she’d hoped she  might be able to drink away.</p>
<p>She fished her mobile out of her  pocket and dialled Rei’s number at the shrine. It began to ring, so  Minako got comfortable by settling herself lengthwise along the bench,  and sat her phone down on her sternum where she could talk into it  without having to lift her arms. She heard Rei’s calm voice speak into  the phone.</p>
<p>Minako blinked and frowned at that. “You’re home? I  thought I was just gonna leave a message. This is okay too, though.  Just let me tell you some things.”</p>
<p>There was an acquiescent silence on the other end, so Minako continued.</p>
<p>“I  know the guestroom thing was a bad . . . thing. I mean, I enjoyed it! .  . . and I thought you did too, but I really didn’t mean for our first  time to be so, uh, unromantic. I guess you thought that’s all it meant  to me . . . but it didn’t. It’s just . . . it’s hard with you, and I  don’t understand it.”</p>
<p>She could hear Rei start to reply to this, so she cut her off.</p>
<p>“No, no, I mean something about you just sets me off and I make mistakes. Like, not just <em>that</em> way, but . . . but I feel like I have to always be moving forward with  you or you close up. Every second you aren’t with me, speaking to me,  is a second you spend thinking things that I never get to know. I . . .  Sometimes I think you don’t even like me!” Tears pooled in her eyes at  this confession a long time coming, and Minako blinked them out. “Like  that time I showed up at the shrine and told you I needed to see you,  and whenever your mother is mentioned, and anytime I get close to you,  you just – you leave me hanging there! We go back to that time where I  did all the talking and you could give a shit! Where do you go? Are you  scared like me? Or do you just not care?”</p>
<p>Minako sat up and wiped her eyes with her sleeves, sniffling and composing herself so she could finish.</p>
<p>“I  thought that maybe I could get close enough that you wouldn’t be able  to ignore me. It drives me mad when you ignore me,” she chuckled and  sniffed. “I guess I just got carried away and ended up pushing too  much. So I’m sorry. I’m really, really sorry. I miss you.”</p>
<p>And  then Rei spoke, so Minako quickly lifted the phone to her ear and  listened for a few moments before she could make sense of what she was  hearing. A laugh bubbled to her lips and died a twisted sob. Minako  slid her phone shut and got back on her bike, stung by disappointment  and crushing humiliation.</p>
<p>“The call you have made cannot be  connected. . . . Please try again, check your directory, or press zero  for assistance. . . . The call you have made cannot be connected. . . .”</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
He  briefly flipped through the pages contained in a folder before putting  it away and sliding the filing cabinet closed. Then the slightly  balding man slid on his rolling chair back to behind his desk where he  laced his fingers together in front of him.
<p>“Well, Rei, usually we  have students repeat classes or take remedial lessons when they miss  this much school. However, all of your teachers speak very highly of  you. I’m told you completed all the assignments you missed and came in  to write exams as well – exams which you scored exceptionally well on.  Is this correct?”</p>
<p>Rei nodded stiffly, shifting anxiously in her  seat. Being in this office, the one were punks and slackers got chewed  out on a daily basis, was not a situation Rei had ever envisioned  herself in.</p>
<p>Vice-principal Yuumura continued. “So, instead of  having you catch up on lessons you already seem to have mastered, you  will only need to make up for some of the school hours missed. I would  like you to choose two of these to see through to the end of the year.”  He extracted a folder from a large pile of documents and slid it across  his desk to her.</p>
<p>With a little trepidation, Rei cracked it open.  The title Club Registration Form glared up at her. She flipped to the  next – Team Waiver Form, and the next – Volunteer Application.</p>
<p>She looked up at the vice-principal, who mistook her resigned expression for one of uncertainty.</p>
<p>“You  don’t have to decide right this moment. Take two of each sheet home  with you and hand in the ones you want to the main office. Here’s a  list of all your options.” He pulled a sheet out from the back of the  folder and handed it to her.</p>
<p>Rei wordlessly did as ordered, stood  when Mr Yuumura did, and politely let herself out of his office. Only  out in the hall did she sigh gloomily. It would figure that the  universe would somehow conspire to get her, Hino Rei, She Who Disdains  Contact With Others, roped into not one, but two extracurricular  activities. Hours spent chumming it up with randoms all looking to pry  her from her comfortably reclusive shell, is all that teams, clubs and  volunteering meant.</p>
<p><em>Solitude was supposed to be an upside of leaving Minako</em>. And then Rei cringed at the casual callousness of this stray thought and walked home at a brisk pace.</p>
