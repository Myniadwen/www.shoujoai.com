  Usagi came to consciousness slowly. The fire 
had died out, and she became aware that the room 
had become uncomfortably cold. She felt stiff 
and chilled to the bone. She sneezed, and 
wondered if she had fallen asleep and everything 
had just been a dream, but the back of her head 
hurt where she had bumped it when she fainted. 
She rubbed the sore spot gingerly. She now had a 
full-blown headache, and badly wanted a bed.
  She went to the main washroom, brushed her 
teeth and cleaned her face, and took some opened 
aspirin. She pulled out a futon and quilt from 
the hall closet, and carried them into Rei&#39;s 
room. She took her clothes off, and put on one 
of Rei&#39;s thin nightgowns. It had certainly been 
a long day, and she would have loved nothing 
more than to go to sleep, but a small moan from 
Rei changed her mind. 
  Rei had slept almost eight hours now, but 
looked as though she&#39;d had a rough time of it.
  Usagi turned on a small desk lamp and crept 
over to her friend&#39;s bedside. She pulled the 
trash can out of Rei&#39;s arms... it had water in 
it. 
  She sighed... poor girl. Maybe she did have a 
stomach virus.
  Rei had kicked the quilt off of the bed in her 
restlessness and was goose bumpy cold in her 
black sports bra and bike shorts. 
  Her skin was very dry... no sweat at all. Her 
lips were parched and cracked. Rei was extremely 
dehydrated. Frightened, Usagi pushed Rei&#39;s soft 
bangs away from her forehead and pressed her 
palm against it. Usagi swore softly. 
  Usagi picked up the fallen quilt and put it 
back on top of Rei. She reached under the quilt 
for Rei&#39;s wrist and counted her pulse to see if 
there was any sign of recovery at all. It was 
slightly fast, but not too bad.
  The rain had finally stopped, and the night 
air temperature had only reached the upper 40&#39;s. 
A waxing harvest moon shown brightly through 
breaks in the clouds and glowed through the 
curtains which fluttered in the light breeze due 
to Rei&#39;s partially opened window. 
  Usagi shivered... it was Artemis&#39; crescent 
moon. 
  She got up to shut the window, then returned 
to Rei.
  &quot;Rei, wake up, hon.&quot; Usagi entreated. 
  Rei&#39;s eyes fluttered open, but her vision was 
blurred. The delicate form of an angel, with an 
achingly beautiful face, hovered over her. She 
felt... warm. I&#39;m dead, she thought to herself. 
No, Rei observed, the vision had one of her own 
favorite sheer lavender nightgowns on! It was 
Usagi... in all her glory. Her breath caught. 
  &quot; &#39;Sagi?&quot;  Rei croaked.
  &quot;Hai, do you feel any better? I need to try 
and get some liquids into you. You are really 
dehydrated. I&#39;d like to avoid the hospital, if 
you don&#39;t mind.&quot; Usagi stated. 
  &quot;Well, lets see, I feel like a truck ran over 
my guts, a sledge hammer is trying to pound my 
brains into a pulp, and I think the Sahara 
Desert is forming on my tongue. I feel great.&quot;
  Usagi giggled. 
  &quot;Do you think you could keep some liquids and 
soda crackers down now? Would you like some 
medicine for your headache?&quot; 
  Rei thought about it. 
  &quot;I&#39;m so thirsty, I will risk it, and I&#39;d love 
a couple of painkillers!&quot;
  Usagi smiled then went to refresh the 
half-gone water in the cup she had placed near 
the trashcan beside the futon. Usagi proffered 
the cup and aspirin to Rei, but noticed she was 
still weak and dizzy, so Usagi helped her to sit 
up. 
  Rei&#39;s hand shook as she took the cup and, 
after she swallowed the medicine she slowly 
sipped the water a little at a time, afraid of 
sickness. Rei noticed the senbazuru that hung 
above her desk. 
  Usagi took the drained cup and set it on the 
floor beside the futon, her hand poised over the 
trash can. Oh please keep it down, Usagi prayed 
silently. She watched Rei carefully, as she lay 
back down and closed her eyes again. 
  &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Usagi asked softly, while 
she adjusted the quilt. 
  &quot;I think so, I just feel really lousy and 
wiped out. Remind me never to do this again! 
  I love the senbazuru... that was really 
thoughtful. Did you make them for me, Usa?&quot; Rei 
asked impressed and touched.
  Usagi grinned sheepishly. 
  &quot;I wish I could take credit for the idea, but 
I can&#39;t. It was Ami&#39;s idea. We each made one, 
though, &#39;cause we love you. Everybody hopes you 
recover from the flu real soon.&quot; Usagi winked at 
her friend.
  &quot;I&#39;ll have to thank everyone, then. You know, 
maybe I can keep some soda crackers down after 
all.&quot; Rei said hopefully. 
  &quot;That&#39;s my brave girl! I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; 
She responded brightly. 
  Usagi found Rei&#39;s housecoat and  padded out of 
the room. She tiptoed past Grandpa&#39;s room, and 
hoped she wouldn&#39;t sneeze. 
  Usagi caught her second wind as the medicine 
she took kicked in. She breezed cheerily into 
the kitchen and put a kettle of water on the 
stove to boil while she looked for teas that 
would soothe a tender stomach. 
  She nuked Mako&#39;s chicken soup while she 
hunted for the soda crackers. Rei needed 
nourishment badly. She had missed about four 
meals, and had lost a lot of liquid. Usagi was 
seriously worried about her friend&#39;s condition. 
  She located the small teacups, took down 
three, along with two matching teapots, and set 
them on a small tray. The water came to a boil, 
so she turned the heat off. She put some fresh 
peppermint tea leaves into the teapot with a 
little ginger, and poured the boiled water over 
them. In the other pot she put some herbs for 
herself to ease her cold symptoms. She set the 
hot chicken soup container on the tray along 
with a ladle and a spoon. Last came the package 
of crackers onto the tray. 
  Usagi blew her nose one more time, washed her 
hands again and with that done, she maneuvered 
her way cautiously back to Rei&#39;s room. 
  Rei opened her eyes as Usagi entered the room. 
Usagi stepped around her own futon to set the 
tray down on the floor beside Rei&#39;s futon 
without mishap. She noted with satisfaction that 
Rei hadn&#39;t fallen back to sleep, and was even 
happier that she hadn&#39;t spilt anything.
  Rei smiled at her cheerful friend.
  &quot;You really enjoy my misery, don&#39;t you? Is 
this Mako&#39;s famous cure-all chicken soup?&quot; Rei 
asked as she sat up shakily. 
  Usagi piled some pillows behind her to help 
prop her up and make her comfortable. 
  She returned Rei&#39;s smile, engagingly.
  &quot;Yup, on both accounts. You and the others 
always take care of me, so this is a real treat. 
Of course, I could call Mina, if you like!&quot; 
Usagi&#39;s voice trembled with mirth as she perched 
on the edge of Rei&#39;s bed. 
  &quot;No thanks, you&#39;re a fine baby sitter.&quot; Rei 
said dryly, and reached eagerly for a soda 
cracker. 
  Usagi carefully poured Rei and herself some 
tea. 
  She regarded Rei nibble and sip through hooded 
eyelids a few minutes in silence, while she 
debated in her mind whether or not to delve 
further into Rei&#39;s fragile psyche. Usagi turned 
her head away, sneezed and blew her nose. She 
may hurt Rei, but if it meant she could get to 
the truth, it would be worth it. Usagi reached 
her decision, gathered her courage together, and 
looked deeply into Rei&#39;s dark amethyst eyes.
  &quot;Well, it appears you&#39;ve finally recovered 
enough to keep your food down! I&#39;m glad you feel 
a little better, Rei-chan.&quot; She was genuinely 
pleased as Rei hungrily helped herself to 
crackers and Mako&#39;s soup. Usagi turned, sneezed 
again, and reached for a tissue, then cleared 
her throat a little. 
  &quot;Would you mind answering just a few more 
questions, while you&#39;re awake?&quot; Usagi looked at 
Rei questioningly over the top of her own 
teacup.
  &quot;Usagi, its almost 1:00 in the morning, can&#39;t 
your questions wait until we get some real 
sleep?&quot; Rei asked tiredly, then gently, &quot;you 
must be exhausted, and it sounds like you&#39;ve 
come down with something.&quot; 
  Usagi sneezed again. 
  &quot;I think it&#39;s just a cold I caught while I 
tramped about in the rain... nothing serious. I 
am tired, but I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep with 
all that&#39;s on my mind. I need to have the 
answers to some important questions soon, Rei, 
in order to resolve some issues that effect all 
of us for all eternity. 
  You see, I have come to a fork in my path of 
life. My Mother came to me tonight and spoke to 
me with regard to my possible futures.&quot; Usagi 
replied quietly, and blew her nose again.
  Rei had polished off the chicken soup, and few 
more crackers. Somewhat sated, she now gave 
Usagi her full attention, curious to know what 
she personally had to do with &#39;possible 
futures&#39;.
  &quot;All right, I&#39;m sorry, Usa, I shouldn&#39;t have 
blown you off like that. What is it you want to 
know?&quot; Rei asked and gave her a weak grin, while 
she balanced her teacup on a quilt-covered knee.
  Usagi regarded Rei seriously for a moment 
before she sighed. 
  &quot;Rei-chan, you must be completely honest with 
me, no matter how painful my questions become, 
ok?&quot; Rei nodded, her curiosity piqued.
  &quot;I want to know what you felt inside when 
Yuuichiro left.&quot;
  That was the last question Rei expected, but 
wasn&#39;t too surprised. She wondered where Usagi 
could be headed, she decided to humor her. 
  She looked back into Usagi&#39;s endlessly dark 
sapphire blue eyes. 
  &quot;I felt betrayed, dirty, and rejected. As if 
nobody could ever love anybody like me... 
someone used and broken. You happy?&quot; Rei sipped 
some of her tea, and avoided Usagi&#39;s pensive 
gaze. 
  Usagi was silent while her proud bodyguard 
fought with a broken spirit. She waited until 
Rei composed herself before she continued her 
line of query. 
  Rei finally looked at Usagi, her eyes dark 
with emotion.
  Usagi resumed gently.
  &quot;Rei, you think he is your last chance for 
any semblance of happiness, don&#39;t you? Jadeite 
is gone so you feel that you are destined to be 
trapped in a loveless life without a soul mate, 
don&#39;t you?&quot; Usagi&#39;s words pricked at Rei&#39;s 
comfort zone.
  Rei bowed her head. 
  &quot;Hai, that sums it up fairly accurately. I 
feel incredibly alone. Not even the fire will 
co-operate with me and show me who my soul mate 
is or was.&quot; She kept her face averted. 
  Usagi took Rei&#39;s empty teacup from her hand 
and set it on the tray to refill it. She clasped 
the Miko&#39;s hands in her own, and decided to risk 
her friendship and take a chance...  
  &quot;You know, Rei, you can try to lie to 
yourself, but I won&#39;t let you lie to me. There 
is one other, isn&#39;t there?&quot; 
  Rei was shocked by Usagi&#39;s forthrightness. 
  &quot;The truth is you do know who your soul mate 
is, and its someone you love very deeply. You 
don&#39;t need the fire to tell you something that 
you already know in your heart. You pray over 
and over that your heart lies to you, don&#39;t you, 
Rei? It&#39;s not Jadeite, or Mamoru, or Yuuichiro, 
you are in love with, is it?&quot; 
  Rei never looked up, as she shook her head 
&#39;no&#39;.
  &quot;Tell me Rei, who has filled your dreams for 
as long as you can remember? Tell me about the 
denial, about those forbidden emotions and 
thoughts you try so hard to bury with anger and 
criticism... just to protect yourself from 
certain rejection. Who is it whom you love so 
intensely, you would rather die in their place 
over and over again, than live in a life without 
that loved one?&quot; 
  &quot;Why are you doing this to me?&quot; She cried in 
anguish.
  &quot;Rei, please look at me! You said you would 
trust me, so answer me. Who are you in love 
with? Who does your soul desire more than anyone 
else?&quot;
  Rei raised her moist purple eyes up slowly to 
meet Usagi&#39;s dark compassionate blue ones. 
  &quot;It&#39;s you, Usagi, I love you. Kami forgive me. 
My heart tells me you are my soul mate. Your 
soul completes mine, and I don&#39;t understand 
why.&quot; She whispered. 
  &quot;From that first day I met you here at the 
jinja, there was something about you... a 
certain connection. I was confused about the 
strange emotions I had for you, and put an 
Ofuda on your forehead. 
  How does the knowledge of this help with 
Crystal Tokyo&#39;s destiny, anyway? We can never be 
together, even if you did feel the same way for 
me. Oh, this is absolutely pointless!&quot; Rei 
hissed the last in exasperation. 
  Usagi couldn&#39;t help but smile as her heart 
rejoiced, and she jumped up and down inside! 
  She brought her face closer to Rei&#39;s. 
  &quot;It&#39;s not pointless. Please bear with me, 
Rei-chan. 
  I must choose between a life of love and a 
life of duty to fulfill destiny. I needed to 
hear you say you loved me, in order to make the 
right decision.&quot; Usagi glanced shyly at Rei. 
  &quot;You see, Rei, I feel the same connection that 
you do... I feel your soul close to mine inside 
me...&quot; 
  She said softly, and brought her lips closer 
to Rei&#39;s. 
  &quot;...my heart tells me that you are my soul 
mate...&quot; 
  Rei could feel Usagi&#39;s warm breath as it 
caressed her lips softly, and sent shivers of 
excitement up her spine. 
  Usagi moved closer still. 
  &quot;...your soul completes mine... &quot; 
  Comprehension fled. Rei sat still and silent. 
This was not reality... but some sort of 
magical moment that would de-materialize like 
an illusion if she blinked. 
  How could this be? 
  Rei resolved it was safer not to accept what 
had transpired. She couldn&#39;t dare to hope, to 
believe... it was wrong! 
  What am I to do? She thought. Kami, I think 
she wants to kiss me! I shouldn&#39;t want this, 
but I... I do want this... I&#39;ve waited so long! 
  Tears of confusion began to slowly course 
down her cheeks from tightly closed eyes. 
  &quot;...and I am in love with you... &quot;
  Usagi parted her wetted lips slightly as she 
laid her right palm softly alongside Rei&#39;s jaw 
line. Then she closed her own eyes, and gently 
drew Rei&#39;s dry, soft, yielded lips into a 
tender kiss. 
  Rei&#39;s fingers trembled as they brushed through 
Usagi&#39;s platinum blond hair. Rei could hear 
Chibi Rei&#39;s voice as it screamed in terror, but 
knew by how soft and sweet the kiss was, that 
Usagi was definitely not her father. 
  Intellectually she knew she shouldn&#39;t react, 
but she felt so starved for any small gesture 
of affection, she couldn&#39;t stop, couldn&#39;t pull 
away. 
  Rei lay weakly back against the pillows, her  
head now cradled by Usagi&#39;s left hand. She 
hesitated, then tentatively filled the kiss with 
her own fire.
  Usagi gradually pushed Rei&#39;s sports bra up 
over her small firm breasts with her right hand, 
she lightly caressed Rei&#39;s left breast, and 
brushed the rosy nipple with her thumb. As Rei 
softly gasped at the unexpected touch, her lips 
parted slightly. 
  Usagi slid her tongue very slowly past Rei&#39;s 
lips and entered the warm moist mouth. 
  Rei touched her princess&#39; tongue with her own, 
and savored the new sensation. Yuuichiro had 
never kissed her this way... he had only pecked 
her on the lips once, of course, Grandpa might 
have had something to do with that.
  Rei succumbed to Usagi&#39;s tender ardor. This 
wondrous Angel treated her with such love and 
kindness... as though she were the most precious 
soul in the world. Rei knew in her heart, that 
Usagi would always treat her that way. Tears 
sprang afresh in Rei&#39;s eyes. 
  My princess... 
  They tasted each other for a few moments, and 
as they grew bolder, their passion escalated. As 
they explored one another, soft sounds of 
pleasure escaped through the tangle of tongues. 
  They touched each other&#39;s faces and necks, 
caressed each other&#39;s breasts, and stroked each 
other&#39;s hair. Intoxicated by one another&#39;s 
touch, they reluctantly pulled away from the 
kiss. Their breaths were hard and fast. 
  They touched their foreheads together and 
gazed into each other&#39;s eyes for a moment. 
  Rei sat up and spoke first. 
  &quot;Usagi-chan, I... we can&#39;t let this happen. 
Our duties must take precedence over our 
desires. This is irresponsible of us. You can&#39;t 
love both Mamoru and I at the same time either, 
someone will be hurt, and I sure don&#39;t want it 
to be me.&quot; Rei said with a tremor in her voice 
and the tears that had already been in her eyes 
began to spill over her cheeks. 
  &quot;I&#39;ve had enough hurt to last a lifetime&quot;.
  Usagi stopped Rei, by a finger put to her 
lips, and leaned forward to kiss the wetness 
from Rei&#39;s wan cheeks. 
  &quot;Shhhh, Rei. I don&#39;t want you to base any 
decisions upon a hypothesis. 
  In your &#39;infinite wisdom&#39;, you assume that 
since he and I are &#39;destined&#39; to be together, 
you are destined to live a loveless, lonely 
life, fraught with rejection. That&#39;s all you&#39;ve 
ever known, after all, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;ve accepted 
that your soul will be tortured and slowly 
consumed by a forbidden desire, haven&#39;t you? 
  I think you&#39;ll either begin to resent me, and 
be useless as my senshi, or you&#39;ll try to commit 
suicide again. I can assure you, Rei, if you 
succeed, I will kill myself.&quot;  
  Rei shifted uncomfortably and suddenly felt 
very light headed.
  &quot;Are you about to be sick again?&quot; Usagi asked 
worriedly, as she noticed her friend&#39;s ashen 
complexion, her hand already on the wastebasket.
  Rei shook her head, &quot;I... just need to lay 
down.&quot; 
  She did, and she closed her eyes tightly. 
  Usagi sighed and lay down next to her.
  &quot;Rei, I guess it&#39;s my turn to come clean and 
smash your conjecture with a little truth.&quot; 
  Rei turned her head to face her friend, and 
opened her dark amethyst eyes. 
  Usagi leaned forward and kissed her deeply. 
She clasped her hands behind her head, and 
settled back comfortably to share the pillows 
with Rei.
  &quot;This isn&#39;t a bedtime story, so don&#39;t fall 
asleep on me!&quot;
  &quot;I promise I won&#39;t.&quot; Rei answered slightly 
breathless. 
  She thought Usagi&#39;s kiss before was wonderful, 
but the way Usagi had just kissed her had 
practically debilitated her. It took her breath 
away and filled her with incredible joy. 
  Who cared about a few germs!
