<pre>Haruka stood there. looking down on the gentle face of Micheru. 
Micheru was like sleeping beauty, laying there in a deep slumber. The 
cleansing light of the morning sun covered the room. Haruka bent down 
and gently kissed Micheru on the forehead. She slowly walked across 
the room to the window seat, careful not to wake her love.

Haruka looked up at the morning sky. It was beautiful, but not even it 
could compare with the beauty of Micheru. Nothing could. &quot;Micheru&quot; 
Haruka whispered, &quot;I am nothing without you&quot;.

&quot;You complete me, you make me whole&quot;, Haruka thought to herself. She 
started to reflect upon all that Micheru and her had been through. 
They had been through thick and thin together, always by eachothers 
side. Micheru had always been there for Haruka, and vice-versa. The 
couple had been insperable every since they had met. They didn&#39;t care 
about the rumours people spread about them everywhere they went, even 
if most of them were true.

&quot;Micheru&quot; Haruka said looking back at the morning sky, &quot;You are my 
reason for living&quot;.

&quot;And you are mine&quot; Came a voice from behind her.

Haruka spun around in surprise. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you were up!&quot; She said, 
her face turning crimson red.

&quot;You weren&#39;t supposed to&quot; Micheru said, stifling a laugh. Haruka stood 
up and put her arms around Micheru.

&quot;I want to stay like this forever&quot; Micheru whispered.

&quot;Your wish is my command&quot; Haruka whispered back, and with that the two 
shared a passionate kiss.
