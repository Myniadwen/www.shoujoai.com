<pre>Hello minna! The Amazoness Duo asked me to write a lemon about Chibi - Usa and 
Hotaru... and here it is, hope you like it!

Hotaru and Chibi - Usa are both 16 in this story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sun was standing high in the bright blue sky shining down on the sea, the 
water glittering as if it was built up out of myriads of diamonds. It was early 
afternoon, the beach was crowded with people who were enjoying the warm summer 
day at the shore. 

The two girls arriving there made a long face as they saw how many people had 
the same idea as them. For some time they only stood there, overlooking the mass 
of people, adults relaxing in the sun, children building castles of sand, 
teenagers playing beach volleyball... not to mention all the guys in the water!

Hotaru put their bag down and took off her sunglasses. Then she looked over to 
Chibi - Usa who seemed to be a little disappointed, she just stood there, 
holding the sunshade. A nudge from her friend ripped the pink haired girl out of 
her thoughts.

&quot;Hey! Are you just going to stand there all day? We didn&#39;t come here for nothing 
but to have fun!&quot; Hotaru said, excited. She was in a too good mood to let it be 
spoiled. So she took Chibi - Usa by the arm and dragged her with her. 

They were lucky and found a nice little spot not too far from the water. Hotaru 
laid out their blankets while Chibi - Usa put the sunshade up before she started 
to take off her clothes, revealing the white and pink bathing dress she was 
wearing underneath. Hotaru did the same and stripped down to her purple and 
black bikini. 

&quot;Bet I&#39;ll pull you under!&quot; Hotaru giggled as she and Chibi - Usa dashed towards 
the water. &quot;So? We&#39;ll see if it won&#39;t be the other way round!&quot; Chibi - Usa 
called after her as the raven haired girl dove into the warm sparkling water and 
started to swim.

Chibi - Usa followed her and looked around confused. She had lost Hotaru among 
the huge amount of people having fun in the ocean. She swam further out, looking 
around and calling her friend, but her voice was swallowed by the crowd. 

She was so busy at watching out for Hotaru that she didn&#39;t notice a shadow 
slowly approaching her beneath the surface. Suddenly, a figure broke the surface 
behind her, grabbed her and pulled her under. 

Gasping for air, Chibi - Usa came up and stared directly into a pair of mocking 
purple eyes. &quot;Told you I&#39;d pull you under!&quot; Hotaru smirked. Chibi - Usa feigned 
anger: &quot;Oh you, just wait!&quot; She tried to grab Hotaru, but the other girl was 
faster and escaped. Chibi - Usa wasted no time and followed her, trying to catch 
her, but it was difficult because the people hindered their movements. Finally, 
Chibi - Usa was able to catch her lover and the girls started a fight, splashing 
water at each other and tried to pull the other under. 

Chibi - Usa spitted some water. &quot;Bah! That&#39;s kind of salty.&quot; She started to feel 
chilly and noticed she was having goose bumps. &quot;Let&#39;s get out and take a 
sunbathing. I&#39;m cold.&quot; She swam back towards the beach, got out of the water and 
relaxed on her blanket. 

As she opened her eyes, she found herself standing in front of Crystal Palace. 
Huh? Why am I back in Crystal Tokyo? she thought confused. She walked into the 
palace, passing doors and people without any reactions of her surrounding, as if 
she was nothing more than a spirit. She gasped as she suddenly saw Helios, who 
she had once fallen in love with when she was younger. He looked so beautiful 
and regal... she could feel her cheeks burning from just looking at him. 

&quot;Can I help you, my king?&quot; one of the palace guards said as Helios approached 
him. &quot;Have you seen Serenity?&quot; King Helios asked. The guard seemed to think a 
little while. &quot;When I saw her last time she said she needed to discuss something 
with Sailor Saturn.&quot;

&quot;Thank you!&quot; King Helios replied and walked off. Chibi - Usa blushed a little, 
but she was curious and followed him. Soon she could see herself older and in 
her princess robe, Sailor Saturn was with her, and the two women had wrapped 
their arms around each other. &quot;Hi dear!&quot; her double called as she saw Helios, 
wrapping her free arm around his neck and kissing him. 

She wanted to know what they were speaking of, but the voices sounded as if they 
were muffled by something, the image was fading, and suddenly she felt herself 
being shaken, her skin burning like fire, she could hear somebody call out her 
name... Chibi - Usa... Chibi - Usa...

&quot;Chibi - Usa!!!&quot; Chibi - Usa opened her eyes and saw Hotaru&#39;s face over her, 
looking a little worried. She noticed the beach was almost empty, the sun was 
standing low, almost touching the water. Have I been asleep that long? she 
wondered. 

&quot;What&#39;s the time?&quot; she said, wincing a little because of her sunburn. Hotaru 
took a look at her watch: &quot;Almost nine p.m... you&#39;ve been asleep for hours!&quot; She 
reached in her bag and got out some ointment for sunburn. She carefully removed 
the straps of Chibi - Usa&#39;s bathing dress and applied the ointment on her 
partner&#39;s red skin. 

Chibi - Usa let out a sigh as she felt Hotaru&#39;s hands gently rubbing the cool 
gel onto her shoulders and back. &quot;I&#39;m such a baka...&quot; she whispered. &quot;That could 
only be me, falling asleep while lying in the sun...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t blame yourself, it was my fault, I should have woken you up but I 
didn&#39;t!&quot; Hotaru said softly. She made Chibi - Usa lie down and applied the gel 
on her legs while the pink haired one glanced towards the water. 

What she saw there was of a breathtaking beauty. It was late enough and the sun 
was slowly setting, coloring the sky and the ocean into wonderful shades. Soft 
blue was mixing with red and orange, bright purple shining where the colors 
met. The sun itself was nothing more than a yellow and orange ball slowly diving 
into the water, leaving an almost white path glowing onto the dark blue water.

Chibi - Usa was stunned. &quot;Hotaru... look at this!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Isn&#39;t this 
beautiful?&quot;

Hotaru stopped what she was doing and looked up. &quot;Beautiful is understated... 
this is... ah, I cannot find words!&quot;

Both girls looked at the beautiful sunset. The sky was getting dark, the first 
stars started to gleam, but Chibi - Usa and Hotaru kept on looking until the sun 
was completely set and the last remains of the spectacle were faded.

Chibi - Usa held Hotaru close to her. &quot;There&#39;s only one thing I know which is 
more beautiful than this...&quot; she said.

&quot;Oh? And that&#39;d be?&quot; Hotaru asked, curious.

&quot;You...&quot; Chibi - Usa whispered as she bent closer to Hotaru. Her lips were 
brushing Hotaru&#39;s and the two girls met in a deep kiss. 

The kiss broke into a multitude which were tender at first, but soon the kisses 
were becoming more and more passionate, making them yearn for more. The whole 
atmosphere seemed arousing, the stars sparkling above them, the ocean sweeping 
the beach, playing a soft melody of love as Hotaru made Chibi - Usa recline on 
the blankets. 

Chibi - Usa let out a soft moan as Hotaru started to trail soft little kisses 
along her neck. She let her hand run into Hotaru&#39;s hair while her other hand was 
roaming on Hotaru&#39;s back, gently caressing her. She grew bolder and reached for 
the fastener to open the top of Hotaru&#39;s bikini. 

Hotaru responded by carefully sliding the straps of Chibi - Usa&#39;s bathing dress 
off her lover&#39;s shoulders and down to her waist, uncovering her upper body while 
Chibi - Usa took Hotaru&#39;s bikini top completely off. 

The pink haired girl let out a moan as she felt Hotaru&#39;s hands on her bare skin, 
gently kneading the flesh of her breasts and lightly pinching the rock hard 
nipples. &quot;Hotaru...&quot; she whimpered, feeling her center heating up as her body 
was responding to Hotaru&#39;s treatment. 

She mimicked her lover by caressing Hotaru&#39;s own breasts, the sweetness of 
Hotaru&#39;s touch was making her forget the painful sunburn. A choked moan escaped 
from her throat as she felt Hotaru&#39;s mouth on her breasts, licking, then sucking 
her nipples while rolling the other one between her fingers. She started to 
writhe on the blanket, her womanhood already moistened with her arousal, crying 
for attention. 

&quot;Go lower, please... Hota - chan...&quot; she pleaded, letting out a strangled gasp 
as Hotaru slipped the bathing dress completely off of her, letting the other 
girl take off her bikini panties. The raven haired girl twisted a little until 
she reached a position where they could both give and receive pleasure, feeling 
her own body needing attention.  

Hotaru moaned as Chibi - Usa let her tongue dance on her heated sex, trying to 
return the pleasure Hotaru had given her earlier. She let her own tongue draw 
circles around Chibi - Usa&#39;s nub, making her beloved shudder of pleasure.

Chibi - Usa slipped a finger inside her lover while she started to suck her 
pearl with abandon, Hotaru&#39;s legs were trembling as she did this, imitating her. 
Hotaru felt close to the edge, but she tried to hold on, wanting her lover to 
come with her. Chibi - Usa was just driving her crazy with pleasure, she lost it 
completely, her mind flashed white, she cried out in ecstasy as she came, the 
last thing she registered was the tight grip around her finger and Chibi - Usa 
crying out her name as she reached her climax at the same time. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Chibi - Usa blinked, spent, she felt she was about to drift off into Morpheus&#39; 
waiting arms. Next to her, Hotaru was already about to doze off. Why not... No 
one will miss us, Chibi - Usa thought as she let sleep overwhelm her.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ssh... be quiet please... don&#39;t wake them up... ^.~
