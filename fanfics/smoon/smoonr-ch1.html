<pre>Intro: Usagi and her friends are now in their sophomore year of High 
School. Mamoru has gone back to the U.S. to finish college or is that 
just what Usagi says. Usagi misses him terribly&#133;she also misses Seiya 
terribly. Then a new enemy arrives and the senshi have even harder 
time fighting! Ami says they&#146;ll need the Starlights&#146; help in order to 
defeat the enemy. No-one knows where Kinmoku is.

Episode#201
The rise of a new enemy; the senshis&#146; trouble. 

&#147;Why did he leave again?&#148; Minako asked Usagi during lunch. &#147;Mina-chan 
you have such a short memory.&#148; Makoto said. Usagi sighed, &#147;Last time. 
Mamo-chan left because he didn&#146;t go to college in the first place. 
Galaxia got to him first &#145;member?&#148; she asked. &#147;Oh yeah I remember now! 
Demo, didn&#146;t he say that he would never leave you again hmmm?&#148; Minako 
asked, &#147;Ami-chan I need some back up here&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Leave Ami-chan alone. She&#146;s not the one with the one-track-mind,&#148; 
Makoto said. The past few months had been completely boring! No Three 
Lights or Yaten for Minako to torture, no Seiya to bug the hell outta 
Usagi (which she kinda missed), no Ami-Taiki fights over who&#146;s right 
who&#146;s wrong, nothing but school, school, school mainly. Even though 
they were gone, the Three Lights were still very popular. Then the 
bell rang and the four girls went back to class. 

Meanwhile in a distant galaxy the sounds of arguing could be heard, &#147;I 
do not!&#148; Sailor Star Healer shouted. &#147;Oh yes you do, I can tell!&#148; 
Sailor Star Fighter shouted back. &#147;What are you two fighting about 
THIS time?&#148; Sailor Star Maker asked. &#147;I said that Healer misses 
Minako-chan and she won&#146;t admit it,&#148; Fighter explained. &#147;Because 
you&#146;re gonna say that I&#146;m in love with her!&#148; 

&#147;So&#133;&#148; 

&#147;I don&#146;t!&#148; 

&#147;Um hmm. Whatever you say Healer,&#148; Fighter grinned at her. &#147;You want a 
black eye?!&#148; Healer asked. &#147;You can&#146;t even reach my eyes!&#148; Fighter 
yelled, &#147;Maybe if you stand on something, then JUST maybe. I wouldn&#146;t 
count on it.&#148; 

&#147;Alright children, settle down. It&#146;s nap time.&#148; Maker said. &#147;Funny&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Hey, why don&#146;t we ask Princess Kakyu if we could go back to Earth!?&#148; 
Fighter suggested. &#147;Do you possibly think she&#146;ll let us? I mean we&#146;ve 
only been here nearly a whole year. She needs our help HERE.&#148; Maker 
said. 

&#147;Damn Maker, you must really NOT want to leave Kinmoku&#133;&#148; 

&#147;No, I just don&#146;t want to be male again.&#148; 

Fighter and Healer looked at each other, they had forgotten that they 
were known as guys on Earth. &#147;I forgot.&#148; Fighter said, &#147;Well we could 
just dress up like men and try to avoid changing into one when 
possible.&#148; 

&#147;That sounds like a plan.&#148; Healer said and Maker agreed with her. 

Back at school Usagi was thinking about Seiya, she didn&#146;t know why she 
just was. She was so lost in her thoughts that she didn&#146;t feel the 
balled up paper hit on the head. She noticed on her desk and opened in 
up it read: 

Whatcha thinking about? &#150;Minako 

Usagi wrote on the paper and threw it back to Minako: 

I miss Seiya. I wish he and Taiki and Yaten were still with us. &#150;Usagi 

I miss them too. &#150;Minako
P.S. You have strange handwriting ^_^ 

Yours is strange too. &#150;Usagi 

Not as bad as yours! &#150;Minako 

Usagi looked at own handwriting, Ok, maybe she&#146;s right. Usagi thought. 

[CM] 

After school that day Usagi was lost in her thoughts once again when 
she accidentally walked into someone, &#147;Sorry,&#148; Usagi said and kept on 
walking then stopped, &#147;Seiya?&#148; she turned around to see Seiya staring 
right at her. Seiya had her hair down and she was wearing her school 
uniform, &#147;Hi Odango,&#148; Seiya said. On the verge of tears Usagi ran up 
to Seiya and hugged her tight. &#147;Nice to see you again too Odango, but 
I can&#146;t breathe.&#148; 

&#147;Gomen Seiya-chan.&#148; 

&#147;Hey whatever happened to &#145;Seiya-kun&#146;?&#148; 

&#147;You&#146;re calling yourself a boy when you&#146;re really female; you do know 
that right? Speaking of which, are you female right now?&#148; 

&#147;Why do you think Usagi?&#148; 

The next day at school Usagi told Ami, Makoto, and Minako that she ran 
into Seiya yesterday, &#147;Was Yaten with him?&#148; Minako asked. &#147;One it&#146;s 
&#145;her&#146; and two no,&#148; Usagi said. &#147;Oh&#133;&#148; Minako sat back down. &#147;Well why 
aren&#146;t they at school today?&#148; Makoto asked. &#147;I duno, but Seiya-chan 
did say something about going to a private school.&#148; Usagi answered. 
&#147;Then that means we can&#146;t watch those interesting fights that Ami-chan 
and Taiki-san almost always had.&#148; Minako complained. &#147;We weren&#146;t 
fighting.&#148; Ami said. &#147;They were kind of interesting though.&#148; Makoto 
said. &#147;We weren&#146;t fighting!&#148; Ami repeated. &#147;Then what was that so 
called &#145;argument&#146; about something about dreams and stars or something 
like that&#133;?&#148; Minako asked. &#147;You don&#146;t even know what we were talking 
about!&#148; Ami said. &#147;I&#146;m confused here, very much so.&#148; Usagi said. Then 
screaming could b heard from back inside the school; the four girls 
ran back inside. The screams were coming from the cafeteria, vines 
were strangling everybody, &#147;That&#146;s different.&#148; Usagi said. The girls 
went into the girls&#146; bathroom to transform: 

&#147;MERCURY CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;JUPITER CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;VENUS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;MOON ETERNAL, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

With a flash of light the four teenage-girls transformed into the 
Sailor Senshi! They went back to the cafeteria to see a flower monster 
just above the tables, &#147;Hey!&#148; Moon shouted and the monster turned its 
attention to her, &#147;Who knows what kind of compost heap you come from, 
but you&#146;re not welcomed here! And believe me. We get to the root of 
every problem. We are the pretty sailor-suited soldiers known as&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Sailor Moon!&#148; 

&#147;Sailor Mercury!&#148; 

&#147;Sailor Jupiter!&#148; 

&#147;Sailor Venus!&#148; 

All: AND IN THE NAME OF THE MOON&#133; WE SHALL PUNISH YOU!!!! 

&#147;Nice to meet you girls, too bad it&#146;s going to be a short one though.&#148; 
the monster said and vines started coming out of the floor. &#147;JUPITER&#133; 
OAK EVOLUTION!&#148; Jupiter shouted. Her attack barely left a scratch. The 
vines wrapped around her legs quickly approaching her arms. &#147;VENUS&#133; 
LOVE &amp; BEAUTY SHOCK!&#148; Venus shouted. Her attack destroyed one vine, 
but it grew right back and started to wrap around her neck and arms. 
&#147;MERCURY&#133; AQUA MIRAGE!&#148; Mercury shouted. The attack was more affective 
than Jupiter&#146;s or Venus&#146;s. &#147;Alright Mercury!&#148; Moon said happily. After 
saying that the vines returned, &#147;Guess I spoke to soon. SILVER MOON&#133; 
CRYSTAL POWER&#133; KISS!&#148; Sailor Moon&#146;s attack did nothing. &#147;MERCURY&#133; AQUA 
RHRASPODY!&#148; The vines absorbed the attack and began to coil around the 
last two senshis&#146; legs. Mercury started rapidly typing on her computer 
before it was too late. &#147;Well?&#148; Moon asked. &#147;Only the Starlights can 
defeat the enemy. Or we need to get upgraded again.&#148; Mercury answered. 
&#147;But no-one knows where they are!&#148; Jupiter said. &#147;I know I don&#146;t!&#148; 
Venus said. 

Just at that moment the Starlights were walking past Juban when Seiya 
felt Usagi&#146;s presence. She stopped walking, turned around, and started 
running towards the cafeteria with Yaten and Taiki close behind.</pre>
