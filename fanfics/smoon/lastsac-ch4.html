----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;A Duke&#39;s son?  What Duke?&quot;
 
&quot;He claims that he&#39;s from Ten&#39;ousei, Highness, though he did not name 
his father.&quot;
 
Minako exchanged a glance with her best friend Rei, and the taller 
princess shrugged.  &quot;He did travel all the way to this resort looking 
for us.  There&#39;s no harm in letting him in.  Please, permit him to 
approach.&quot;
 
The servant nodded and opened the door, and a tall young man with blonde 
hair and a richly embroidered suit entered, boots echoing on the floor, 
a sword by his side.  He wore a tight, amused smile on his lips, but his 
bow befit his rank, and the princesses of Kasei and Kinsei inclined 
their heads.  &quot;Your name, young sir?&quot;
 
&quot;Boku no namae wa Urakaze Haruka desu.  Dozo yoroshiku onegaishimasu.&quot;
 
&quot;Pleased to meet you, Haruka-kun.  Atashi wa Kino Rei de, Atashi no 
tomodachi wa Aino Minako to iimasu.  Dozo yoroshiku.  Why have you 
come?&quot;
 
&quot;To learn, Highness, and to meet you at last.  I imagine there is much 
you could teach a lowly Duke&#39;s son.&quot;
 
Rei smiled, her fighter&#39;s sense catching the challenge.  &quot;I&#39;m certain.  
You&#39;re welcome in my castle for as long as you can stand it.&quot;
 
Haruka bowed his head mockingly, his eyes dancing at the challenge.  &quot;We 
shall see who gives first.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Oh my . . . Minako, he is quite a fighter.&quot;
 
Minako smiled as she helped Rei sit down on her bed.  &quot;You were great, 
but he was better.  I think he was trained by King Koshu, as good as he 
is.  Are you okay?&quot;  Minako began to massage Rei&#39;s knotted shoulders, 
and the taller senshi began to relax.
 
&quot;Thank you, Mina.  That feels wonderful.&quot;  She reached up and covered 
Mina&#39;s hand with hers, but Mina pulled away.
 
&quot;Rei-chan, we can&#39;t.  My father called today, again, and he found me a 
new suitor.  He wants me married as soon as possible.&quot;
 
Rei took Mina&#39;s hand and placed it against her cheek, pouting.  &quot;I never 
get to have any fun.&quot;  Minako raised an eyebrow, and Rei sighed.  &quot;I 
know.  But you don&#39;t have to leave just yet.  You can extend your visit 
a little bit.&quot;
 
&quot;I really can&#39;t, Rei.  He&#39;s already suspicious and Mother is sick with 
worry.  It&#39;s not proper for the two of us to be so close.  We&#39;re 
supposed to be friends and partners but not anything more.  We can&#39;t 
break our family lines for the sake of our relationship.&quot;
 
&quot;I love you, Minako.  Isn&#39;t that enough?&quot;
 
&quot;No, Rei, but I wish it was.  It&#39;s the Curse of the Sailor Senshi to 
love and lose.  I&#39;ll marry some Duke but I&#39;ll always think of you.&quot;  
Mina let Rei draw her into her arms, and she closed her eyes as her 
tears began to flow.  &quot;Always.&quot;
 
Haruka watched the pair from the partially opened door, and she sighed.  
No matter where in the Silver Millennium she went, she found parents who 
would not leave their daughters alone.  Poor Rei and Minako.  Haruka 
clenched her fist, barely refraining from slamming her hand into the 
wall.  Maybe they really didn&#39;t love each other forever and with their 
whole heart, but even just a little love like theirs should be 
respected.  Minako and Rei would both marry men one day and rule their 
respective kingdoms well, but they deserved to keep caring about each 
other.  Silently, Haruka retired to the room she had been given, ready 
to relax her aching muscles and desperate to keep her identity a secret.  
Kasei&#39;s Phobos Deimos Castle and Mokusei&#39;s Io Castle would be testing 
grounds for her, then the Moon, then she should be ready for Kaiousei&#39;s 
Triton Castle and Michiru.
 
The image of little Princess Kaiou Michiru snapped into Haruka&#39;s mind, 
and she just smiled.  That girl, wavy aqua hair barely restrained, pale 
blue dress accenting the sapphire blue in her eyes, had been beautiful 
that day, and Haruka suddenly wished that she had kept in touch with the 
Neptunian Princess, or spoken to her at least once.  She would rectify 
that mistake on Michiru&#39;s upcoming birthday, and she would become the 
senshi&#39;s partner as the Soldiers of Kaiousei and Ten&#39;ousei should be.  
Then she would have the power to be the Queen of Uranus as she deserved 
to be, as she was born to be.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Leaving?  Why, Haruka-kun?  Are you afraid of being beaten?&quot;
 
&quot;By you, Rei-san?  No, I do not believe so.  You have improved in 
unarmed combat and learned the particulars of sword-fighting that only 
come from knowledge and practice, so my damage here is done.&quot;  Haruka 
bowed, his hand on the hilt of his jewel-encrusted sword sheath.  He had 
not used that sword for practice, and Rei supposed that it was some 
beautiful, expensive heirloom.  &quot;By the way, Rei-san, Minako-san; all 
love is a fragile flower that must be nurtured, even if it must be 
hidden.  Do not let others destroy your flower before it has a chance to 
blossom and grow.  I wish you luck as princesses, senshi, and queens.&quot;  
Haruka once again bowed.  In his mind, as he left, he could hear the one 
song he had composed on his new instrument, and he smiled to himself.  
That was his song.
 
Rei laid her hand on Mina&#39;s and smiled.  &quot;I think he knows, Mina.&quot;
 
&quot;He does.  We&#39;ll think about it.&quot;</pre>
