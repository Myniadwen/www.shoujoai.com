<p><em>Makoto  walked down the hall, inching closer and closer to her target...</em></p>
<p><em>Her hand was  raised to knock when she heard it.</em></p>
<p>“<em>H-hey! Watch where  you're putting those ha- AH! Rei-chan, I said stop already!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Come back here and-  Oof!”</em></p>
<p>Makoto cringed as  she heard a large crash. She decided to bite the bullet and knock.  “Rei? Minako?” At least they were awake... “Are you guys  alright?”</p>
<p>“That hurt...” Makoto  thought she heard Minako mutter.</p>
<p>“It's your own fault for  trying to escape punishment.”</p>
<p>Makoto could feel  the beads of sweat start to trickle down her neck. <em>Looks like they  don't have much in the name of hangovers... </em>She tried knocking  again, this time harder. “Rei! Minako!”</p>
<p>There  was a very distinguished squeal from within, most likely from the  realization that they weren't as alone as they thought. <em>What </em>are <em>they doing in there? </em>Makoto couldn't help but wonder.</p>
<p>She  coughed and then announced, now that she had their attention.  “Breakfast is ready and on the table. Come when you're ready,”  she paused, thinking of all the things she'd heard through the door,  and sighed. “Ready and decent, alright?”</p>
<p>As  she was met by silence, Makoto took it as a sign that she could  leave, having safely delivered the message. It wasn't until she was  turning the corner when Rei's unmistakable shout called after her,  “It's not what you think!”</p>
<p><em>And  just how would you know what I'm thinking...</em> Makoto couldn't help  but think, continuing down the hall, <em>if you weren't fully aware of  what you were really doing?</em></p>
<p>“Ah, Mako-chan? How is it?”  Makoto sighed as she leaned down to sit. Usagi added, “Are they up?  Will they be coming out soon?”</p>
<p>Makoto  took a sip of her orange juice. “Yeah, they're up. I don't think  it'll be long before they come out, either. They seemed to be in the  mood for rushing...”</p>
<p>Ami  frowned at Makoto's indifferent expression. “Mako-chan?” Makoto  looked over at her questioningly. “Did they really say that?”</p>
<p>Makoto  waved it off. “Just wait- they'll be out soon...”</p>
<p>True  to her word, Rei and Minako followed shortly thereafter, still  combing out stray tendrils of hair.</p>
<p>But  of course, before that could take place, Makoto <em>had</em> to relate  what she had overheard to their housewife of a leader, in thanks for  cooking breakfast.</p>
<p>Which  is how the rumored duo arrived to hearing Usagi exclaim, “EHH!  Rei-chan and Minako-chan stayed up all night playing Be-De-eSu-eM  games!”</p>
<p>If there was ever a moment for time to freeze, this would be one  of those moments.</p>
<p>It was then that Usagi turned back to her 'thinking pose'.</p>
<p>Actually, it would be more accurate to describe it as her  'airheadedly clueless' pose.</p>
<p>Thus her time-unfreezing-and-refreezing phrase. “Eh? What does  BDSM mean?”</p>
<p>Strangely enough, both Rei and Minako knew exactly what that  meant, though they both started to blush furiously at that.</p>
<p>Rei jumped forward to defend, “Where the heck did you get <em>that</em> from! It's not true! Not true at ALL!”</p>
<p>The dream with the tentacle monster  resurfaced.</p>
<p>The other girls were left to wonder  what <em>really</em> happened, to make Rei blush again.</p>
<p>Makoto asked for the sake of the  others.</p>
<p>The blush increased.</p>
<p>Minako coughed into her hand, her idol  experience finally grabbing hold of her. “Oh, come off it,  everyone. You don't honestly believe Rei-chan and I have that sort of  relationship, do you?” <em>Though... it might be... interesting, to  say the least...</em></p>
<p>Makoto shrugged. “All <em>I</em> said  was I heard something about punishment, a loud noise, and  struggling..” She sipped her coffee. <em>I hate it when I have to  listen to Mrs. Ikawa in the morning... I can't help but shake the  feeling that it does something not-positive to my mood... Or rather,  my mouth... so sorry girls, but it looks like you're today's  victims...</em></p>
<p>Whatever the case, it most certainly  did not help when even Ami was putting on a thoughtful look. A <em>genuinely</em> speculative look.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minako tried to explain, her  occasionally twitching eye the only indication that she was not meant  to take this sort of talk so often as it had been brought up in the  last few days. “About that... I was really just teasing Rei-chan a  bit because I found a white hair on her and Rei-chan got embarrassed  and started tickling me... you know, like how we were before Ami-chan  arrived. It was innocent; it really was. I honestly don't know how  you could have gotten any ideas about us staying up <em>all</em> night  either- we went to bed not long after you guys did, after all.”</p>
<p>The doctoral thoughtful look's cause  came into the light. Ami looked up. “I see... that makes sense,  but... a few hours ago, when everyone should have been asleep, I woke  up and went for a glass of water... and I heard...” At this point,  Ami stopped, realized what she was saying, and looked down at her lap  while blushing. Not nearly as hard as the Love and Passion duo  though, each remembering their respective dreams. The sort of dreams  that you did not share, even with friends as close as these, much  less so over breakfast.</p>
<p>Which reminded Minako's stomach, who  growled, <em>Feeeeeeed me.</em></p>
<p>Minako put a hand to her stomach as she  smiled. “Rather than talk about that, can we eat?”</p>
<p>As the two (privately-nervously) joined  the others at the table, coincidentally next to each other again,  they were all given the OK to start.</p>
<p>Oddly, the subject was not brought up  again for the duration of the meal.</p>
<p>Rei was still not sure what Ami had  heard.</p>
<p>And she was not sure she wanted to  answer with her alibi if she got enough nerve to bring it up again.</p>
<p>Minako, sipping her morning tea, was  the very image of calmness.</p>
<p>Even though she was likely even more  embarrassed than Rei inside, considering how the nature of her dream,  frighteningly vivid, might have resulted in some rather loud moans on  her part.</p>
<p>Which reminded her that she had to  definitely make sure to take a good, thorough shower before she left  for the day.</p>
<p>“Minako? Minako-chan?”</p>
<p>The idol blinked and came back to the  situation at hand, particularly, the hand being waved in front of  her. She smiled. “I'm sorry; I must have spaced out for a moment.  What did you say?”</p>
<p>Usagi did not seem at all phased at  Minako's lack of attention as she enthusiastically asked a normally  mundane question. “When do you have to leave for work today?”</p>
<p>“When?” Minako thought about it, long and hard. She looked up  with a smile. “I'm not sure... after we finish here I'll have to  call my manager and see.”</p>
<p>“You don't know your own schedule?”</p>
<p>Minako scoffed without thinking. “What  sense in there in having more than a handful of people working  directly under you, not even to mention all those distantly in the  same network, if you can't make use of them? Of course I don't  remember everything on my schedule- my manager has my day planner.”</p>
<p>Rei continued to eat, apparently  choosing to end that string of conversation. Breakfast was soon  finished, and Makoto helped Usagi wash the dishes while Ami and  Minako showered before getting ready to go to work. Minako apparently  had a full schedule today, to make up for all the other days.</p>
<p>Ami left first, telling them that she'd  try to meet up with them all again before Minako had to leave.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Makoto was called back on  an urgent emergency that only she could deal with in person, so when  Rei asked for another moment of Minako's time, Makoto ended up being  the second person to leave. As if it were some strange twist of fate,  Usagi-chan also had to leave, something about having plans to shop  for a small anniversary (small origin of an anniversary, not  necessarily a small present) gift, and she'd leave the shrine to Rei.</p>
<p>And so, Minako and Rei sat on the  porch, their feet dangling as they looked out on the brisk autumn  weather.</p>
<p>Minako asked what she wanted to talk  about, but Rei didn't say anything. They sat in silence, soaking in  each other's presence.</p>
<p>And then, nonchalantly, as if she were  discussing the weather, Rei asked, “Tell me ahead of time. Do you  have any intention of returning here after your day is done?”</p>
<p>Minako blinked, looking over at the  priestess. <em>Is she... why...?</em> “Is it a bother?” It suddenly  occurred to Minako that she should have asked this before staying  over the second night. Rei had only let her stay over the first night  back because... well actually, Minako didn't really know, as they  hadn't talked <em>that</em> much, as intended, before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Rei's eyes shot open nonetheless at the  quiet tone of her question. “No! I mean, it's not that. Not really.  I...” Rei scratched her cheek, trying to figure out how to say this  without another misunderstanding resulting from it. Even though the  people most likely to misunderstand were already gone. “Umm...  Artemis must be lonely, right? You didn't bring him, so...”</p>
<p>Minako blinked again, this time in a  different sort of surprise. Her hand slowly went up to her mouth, her  eyes impossibly widening with each second. “Artemis! I can't  believe I...” She stopped, lost in thought again. “I dropped him  off at Usagi's house with Luna on the way from the airport...  Usagi-chan was out on an errand, and I didn't want to disturb them  that night, so...”</p>
<p>Rei formed a wry frown. <em>And yet it  was perfectly okay to bother me. </em>She struggled to ignore the part  of her that said, <em>Who cares? You wanted to see her and you were up  anyway, so what does that matter?</em></p>
<p>It also didn't help that at just that  moment, Minako looked over to her with an apologetic smile. As  everyone is well aware, Minako-chan's smile is a deadly weapon  against any of her purely devoted fans. As the collection would  reveal, Rei was one of those fans.</p>
<p>And so Rei kissed her shields goodbye  with a customary blush, hidden by a quick look at the garden. “It's  starting to get cold these days, isn't it.”</p>
<p>Minako smiled, looking at her best  friend. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Rei blinked and looked back at Minako,  which was a mistake and yet not. “What for?”</p>
<p>Minako leaned closer, wrapping her arms  around her neck. “For putting up with me these last two nights.”</p>
<p>Rei scoffed and turned her head away.  “I've been 'putting up' with you since the day I met you. One or  two nights isn't going to change that.”</p>
<p>Minako leaned back, though she was  still fairly close to the priestess. As her finger doodled on the  freshly wiped wooden floor, she whispered, “Let me pay you back  then. For troubling you. For depending on you.”</p>
<p>Rei, like a diseased addict, looked  back at that which killed her defenses. Minako didn't meet her  glance. Rei sighed, returning her gaze to the sky above. “Is it  still open?”</p>
<p>Minako blinked hard at that. Sometimes,  it was <em>very</em> disconcerting to try to understand Rei's  roundabout way of avoiding and returning to the subject at hand. She  couldn't help but smile as she thought, <em>Is she like this after  observing how I acted while I still had my mask up with her? When I  tried convincing foe and friend alike that I was the princess? </em>“What  is?”</p>
<p>The blush began to creep back into  Rei's expression. “You know now. That I've been collecting. So  there's no point in hiding it. Would you really give me free  tickets?”</p>
<p>A very, very, <em>very</em> amused grin  appeared on Minako's face, blossoming from nothing. Rei saw this out  of the corner of her eye and immediately went beet red.</p>
<p>“Well if you're not going to stay- I might as well go to the  concert, and if I can save money via connections then...”</p>
<p>“Connections, huh?” Minako leaned over again, this time to  whisper in Rei's ear, “Is that all I am to you?”</p>
<p>She hadn't meant it to come out that  way. Really at all, if she had the time to think about it, but  something about Rei's demeanor drew out the reckless side of her. Or  maybe it'd been waking up next to her after having that dream...</p>
<p>Regardless, Rei's blush increased,  though this time, she had no defenses with which to call forth a  cloud of dust and run for the hills in the confusion.</p>
<p>“I...”</p>
<p>Rei took a deep breath. Minako waited,  suddenly curious as to what Rei might say. She, in her curiosity, did  not stop to consider that her proximity to the speaker might be  interfering with the necessary thought capacities of said speaker.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as inspiration hit the  priestess, she broke into a smile and leaned forward, kissing the  idol on her ear. “Payback. And no, I hardly think of you as a  business connection. However, for the sake of holding something over  the heads of those little brats, it'd be nice to have something other  than my collection to show for it.”</p>
<p><em>Is bragging rights any better than  being used as a business connection?</em> Minako smiled softly,  leaning forward to rest her chin on Rei's shoulder. “How many do  you want?”</p>
<p>“Can I get one backstage pass?”</p>
