<h1>Under the Pale of a Vanishing Moon (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/underpale-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Time is the ordering of chaos and while there are many through out the 
worlds and universes that claim other wise, it was not created by 
mortals. It was only named by them. Time happened; it occurred even when 
it was called nothing because Time is in effect merely change and 
growth, the simple passage of one event to another. Everything changes; 
it is one of the constant movements of the universes. But mortals had to 
call it something so that it would make sense to them and in the course 
of having to name the phenomenon unwittingly gave Time something that no 
other creatures could. They gave it a will of sorts, making Time through 
its ordered randomness usher forth paradoxes in the form of 
anthropomorphic personifications. In other words, it allowed the 
creation of gods, guardians, and other unstable things that could 
&quot;control&quot; it, &quot;protect&quot; it, and even &quot;destroy&quot; it. A startling thing 
since it really can not, will not, and does not need to be controlled, 
protected, or destroyed.

Time is strange. It has no true voice or personality and yet there are 
certain things and aspects of itself that it seems to favor over others. 
If it had the true capacity it would find that it was (and possibly 
still is) proud of its allowing the creation of Sailor Pluto, known also 
as Setsuna Meioh. Never had there been a being more capable of 
understanding (even if that understanding was but a single drop of water 
in a vast ocean) Time with its quirks, paradoxes, and frequent snubs at 
being labeled perfectly ordered.

Being favored though, however unaware of it Setsuna was, came at a 
price. And the cost was a heavy set of rules with admonishing 
attachments such as, &quot;Do not break this rule or you will die.&quot; Even with 
the cost of her duty firmly on her mind she found that under certain 
circumstances Time&#39;s rules were made to be broken. It did not mean she 
enjoyed the moments when she had to break those rules. It also did not 
mean she enjoyed the overwhelming breadth and scope that her powers 
contained and allowed her to do.

There was a price to be paid for everything in life.

At the moment the price she was paying was a staggering headache for 
having combined into her other selves and jumping straight through the 
center of Time to land... Well she was just about to find out.

This was the most unpleasant part of the entire experience, which was 
why she hardly ever used the Center of Time. It was, in effect, much 
quicker to go to the center and then jump to when she wanted or needed 
to be, but the pace of it had a tendency to turn her stomach slightly.

Her eyes were still closed and she was certain she could feel solid 
ground beneath her feet but that did not mean she was actually on solid 
ground. The problem was quite simply that in its center Time was at its 
peek. It was all that Time could be and that meant that Time knew 
exactly when Setsuna needed to be (even if she did not), but Time hardly 
took the notion to know exactly where she needed to be. This would lead, 
on the very few occasions that she moved from the center, to some 
interesting experiences. For example there was one occasion where she 
found herself standing in mid-air like a confused cartoon character that 
had run too far out towards a cliff&#39;s edge. Time got it mostly right 
though, she was only ever just slightly off when she arrived. She just 
preferred having more control over the exact when and where she was 
going to end up.

With a slow breath she reached out her hands and found, when she 
gradually opened her eyes, she was clutching desperately to a marble 
balcony railing. And also, to her great relief, noted that she was 
indeed standing on the balcony and not hanging over it. Just because she 
tended to be cool, calm, and collected most of the time did not mean she 
was incapable of moments of embarrassment. She just usually had those 
moments when no one else was around to see them.

She looked out from the balcony to a gorgeous view of the Earth, a hazy 
almost pale blue light spilling from it to illuminate her surroundings. 
Her grip on the railing loosened and she looked down to see the swirl of 
the Moon&#39;s silver ocean crashing below. She smirked and then turned 
around. Behind her she could see inside of the palace through two large 
and elaborately decorated glass doors. A grand celebration was going on 
inside, a masked ball.

She watched the people carefully and then quickly noticed that she was 
not in her uniform any longer. She was wearing instead a dark maroon 
gown which occasionally sparkled in the light as if it were delicately 
brushed with stardust. There was a time, a section of her life she 
called her happiest, when that dress had been her favorite article of 
clothing. She recalled briefly how there were moments when she just 
prayed for a party to attend so that she could wear it, after all, she 
had designed it herself. And she had designed another one that was pale 
silver and-

Memories quickly snapped to attention and the exact when and where 
became perfectly clear to her. Well, perhaps not exactly perfect. She 
should not have been in that dress. She should have remained in her 
uniform. Being in that dress meant-

&quot;I&#39;m going to hate me in the morning,&quot; she whispered with some chilled 
recollection. There was not a real problem. It was just that in her jump 
through the center she had completely replaced her past self, who was 
going to wake up very confused and with a migraine she would not have 
wished upon her worst enemies once everything was all sorted out and 
back in proper place. It bothered her slightly that things had occurred 
in that manner. She was used to being able to exist as multiple versions 
of herself at any point in Time. She could never do such a thing for an 
extended period but it could be done.

She let out a long breath and looked to her left quickly picking up the 
mask that she knew was going to be there. She brought it to her face and 
entered into the thrall of the event.

Something was terribly wrong with the way everything was laying out 
before her, but for a small plus side the headache she had was dying 
away. That fact failed to make her any more comfortable with her present 
situation though.

Moving shadows
We take turns as if in a dance
We think these movements our own
But nothing we touch is left to chance
There are rules to each thing
Motions that must be made
We must dance to the time
To the rhythm that Destiny has laid

Setsuna&#39;s breath caught slightly as she moved through the crowd and 
observed the grandeur and splendor that surrounded her. Never had there 
been or would there be a place as wondrous as what the people of the 
Moon had spent near eons perfecting, a civilization of peace, beauty, 
and elegance. It was not so much a utopia, as it was an Eden. It had its 
failings as anything mortal made tends to have but it stood out as the 
best that could be achieved by mortals. Even gods had to admit they were 
impressed with it.

It was difficult to be back. Memory stirred emotions that had taken 
Setsuna decades of guarding the Gates of Time to heal. She kept herself 
as she always did, stoic and cool in the face of knowing the destruction 
that waited for the kingdom. Destruction that was about ten years off, 
and how long those years would seem, how wonderfully peace filled and 
uncaring the days would slip by. She bit at the inside of her mouth when 
she began to feel guilty. If there was a way she could have stopped it 
she would have, but Time would have none of it. Time in its vastness 
would glare back at her and chide that even such greatness, such 
marvelous achievement had to undergo change.

Nothing was forever.

Everything changed.

&quot;And the price paid is but the memory of what was,&quot; she muttered under 
her breath as she reached one of the many tables laid out with 
refreshments.

She took a piece of fruit from off of a platter and popped it into her 
mouth. Her eyes swept across the room for any signs of distress. What 
had her other selves said? The change would be small. It would be 
something that others would regard as trite. It would-

There was a sudden blare of trumpets ushering forth a fan fare. She 
looked towards the large marbled staircase that led down into the 
ballroom and took a breath for the one that she was going to miss. It 
felt too soon for this, but then she remembered, she had been out on the 
balcony.

The party was in celebration of a recent agreement to peace between the 
Earth and the Moon. It was to be the end of bad blood that began with a 
simple misunderstanding (and the bad blood would return again, the 
treaty would mean nothing in ten years). Setsuna had taken to the 
balcony for fresh air after she had had a brief disagreement about the 
arranged marriage that went along with the treaty. She remembered 
thinking that it was unfair, and then regretting that argument heavily 
because it had nothing to do with fairness and everything to do with 
duty. She never had to be reminded about that. Duty was sometimes all 
she had. It was the only thing that was so constant that change seemed 
leave it alone solely on principle.

The fanfare played on and the royal courts from around the solar system 
slowly began to descend the staircase, all the planets represented there 
in all their glittering grandeur.

&quot;Except Pluto,&quot; a woman near her muttered. &quot;The Plutonians never come to 
these events.&quot;

&quot;Why not,&quot; the woman&#39;s companion asked lightly.

&quot;Because,&quot; the woman began softly with wisps of anxiety in her voice, 
&quot;looking at them is like looking into the face of Death.&quot;

Her maroon eyes shut briefly and she fought the need to turn around and 
face the two behind her. She wanted to tell the truth, but knew better 
of it and pushed up through the crowd and away from them. For the truth 
was simply that people from her planet just preferred the solace of 
their world. It was so easy a thing that so many just took as something 
else. It made her a little sad in a way.

The Earth delegation finished entering and shortly after followed the 
court of the Moon. And after the court was the queen&#39;s personal guard, 
all hand picked maidens from each of the planets in the solar system. In 
all technicalities she herself was considered one of the royal guards 
but she never processed. People tended to worry greatly if they saw her 
in an official capacity. They tended to fear her for everything she knew 
of Time, and she never understood it but took the excuse to avoid too 
much public exposure. She had always preferred a mild amount of 
anonymity. It kept things simple and in perspective. It had kept her 
distant but not distant enough.

She often wondered if she would have been better off if she had never 
introduced herself to anyone. Would she have been a more capable 
guardian if she had never let herself become attached to the royal 
family? If she had never become friendly with the Outer Senshi, would 
her duty be less of a burden if there was only herself and Time?

The answer was always, perhaps. But the questions seemed silly to ask 
since there was no turning back. There was no changing what she had 
chosen as her life. There was only the path she was on and the duty she 
knew she had freely accepted.

Her heart began to beat rapidly at the sudden change in the trumpeting. 
The notes transformed into something that was more regal, and stately. 
It was a sound that announced greatness and beauty. It was all she could 
do not to rush up the steps and do something completely foolish. She 
wished she could be foolish. She wished as her heart broke over and over 
again in rapid succession with each step down into the ballroom Queen 
Serenity took.

No stopping Time, Setsuna thought, No halting what is to come for her. 
No grand rescue that can be preformed to bring her back. There is only 
Time&#39;s promise. There is only that I have to cling to.

It isn&#39;t enough
What I feel for you and the words I can say
It isn&#39;t enough
I know our plight
I know what shall occur
I lose...
I lose you
To Destiny
To Fate
To Duty
To Time
I lose
And losing you
Knowing that I lose you
Knowing you fade from my grasp
It isn&#39;t enough
The knowledge can not change anything
I lose...
And it isn&#39;t enough
It isn&#39;t enough
To stop my loving you

A small myriad of speeches was given regarding the treaty. Setsuna 
absently listened to the words, keeping her mask to her face to avoid 
being seen. She wanted to appreciate the view she was being given. She 
wanted the moment to last in her mind forever. Hearing Queen Serenity 
speaking again, and addressing a crowd, keeping them enthralled, she had 
nearly forgotten what a divine voice the queen had.

As the last words died away and the party was allowed to swing back into 
action Time&#39;s lovely paradox watched the way the queen lingered around 
the stairs rather than immediately going to her table or taking a dance. 
Setsuna moved up through the crowd and when she was nearly to the stairs 
she slowly brought the mask away from her face. She was unsure if she 
was seen by any of the others. She took a second to collect her 
emotions, to make sure she appeared as she should, calm and cool.

&quot;Majesty,&quot; she said as she tapped the queen on her shoulder. She had to 
do this. She had to say the following words. They were important. They 
meant so much to her. Her past self would never forgive her if she 
forgot.

Serenity turned around and smiled broadly. She looked as if she was half 
ready to throw her arms around the taller woman, but then suddenly 
remembered she was supposed to be dignified. She politely nodded giving 
Time&#39;s Guardian permission to continue speaking.

&quot;Will you dance tonight?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps... Is that all you needed to ask me?&quot;

&quot;You were right.&quot;

A cheeky grin began to drift across the woman&#39;s lips, &quot;Is that so?&quot;

She straightened herself and cleared her throat. Even as she was, with 
all her knowledge of what was to come, she still found it hard to admit 
that she was wrong. She continued, &quot;It is so. I...over reacted.&quot;

The queen looked as though she was tremendously pleased and then her 
expression changed to something more somber and slightly confused. 
&quot;You...You appear to be different tonight Lady Pluto.&quot;

&quot;Do I?&quot;

&quot;You look... older.&quot;

No, Setsuna thought, what you are seeing is that I look younger. I died 
Serenity. I died doing exactly what you said I would do. Do you remember 
that?

She pushed her long evergreen hair off her shoulders and said, &quot;Must be 
the lighting.&quot;

&quot;Must it,&quot; she paused and then smiled broadly, &quot;I think I will away to 
my table and... if I have the chance, perhaps...Perhaps we can manage 
that dance.&quot;

Setsuna made a slight bow and watched as Queen Serenity moved off 
towards her table. She kept a close eye and noted that something caught 
the queen&#39;s attention making her wander off towards the right, towards 
the balcony doors.

&quot;That,&quot; Setsuna whispered shakily, &quot;That is not right.&quot;

Very quickly the Guardian of Time moved towards the shadows she pulled 
out a small key that she kept secured by the strap of her gown. She 
moved the key into the darkness, turning it as if she were opening a 
door and a section of swirling green and purple fog appeared. She 
stepped into it and vanished, leaving behind the party and the shadows 
that had been there.

Under the pale of a vanishing world
In the longing hours between my dreams and waking
There is a memory of you standing
Walking towards another
Venturing away from my heart
The robes are clad in black
The smile a toothy grin
It is a specter I can not defeat
An image that has no waking
A moment that can not be stopped
Under the pale of a vanishing world
Comes what even the strongest of loves
Can not hope to defeat
All I have
All I can do
Is think of a promise made to me
I think of what Time can give
And I know I will see you again

There is no sound in Time. Everything is hushed and noiseless, but it 
seemed that there was indeed the hurried utterance of movement passing 
through Time&#39;s great halls.

She ignored the fact that her shoes were actually making a barely 
audible clicking noise and kept walking. She turned a few times as if 
venturing down a separate passage way, though there were no true walls. 
She came to an abrupt halt and transformed out of her gown and into her 
uniform. A key ring dangled from her side and she removed it from her 
belt searching desperately until at last she found the key she was 
looking for.

It was oddly shaped. It did not look like it was actually a key, though 
its place on her belt informed of its purpose. She took it off the ring 
and inserted it into the swirling, colored vapors of Time. She turned it 
clockwise once and then counterclockwise a number of five times. There 
was a tiny popping sound and an actual wooden door appeared and opened.

She reached inside of it and pulled out her staff. Then she shut the 
door took the key and turned it again clockwise at first and then 
counterclockwise until the door opened again.

She stepped back from it and did a quick move spinning the staff in a 
dramatic and deadly fashion. When she brought it down it made a heavy 
sound, like large weights falling onto concrete. A thin smile perked at 
the corner of her mouth. She took a deep breath, removed the key from 
the door, put it on the key ring, placed the key ring back onto her 
belt, and stepped through the door.

It shut with a very loud thud.

&quot;I take no pity on those who dare threaten my domain,&quot; Setsuna&#39;s voice 
rang out through Time. It echoed and bounced off the corridors.
