After Usagi had confessed to the others about her true feelings for 
Mamoru everyone had gone home again. Except for Usagi and Mamoru. Rei 
had asked Usagi to stay a bit longer because she wanted to discuss 
something with her. Mamoru had decided to go and wait in the car for his 
fianc&eacute;e.&quot;Usagi...I am completely behind you on this but I don&#39;t think 
that lying to Mamoru will make things better. Maybe worse but not 
better.&quot; The raven haired girl said.

&quot;I know Rei, but I can&#39;t find the courage to tell him. I know I will 
have to face him about this soon but...I can&#39;t hurt him.&quot; The blonde 
replied, looking down at the ground. They had been seated on the couch 
for a couple of minutes now, she had already started wondering when Rei 
would finally bring up the reason for wanting her to stay a bit longer.

&quot;You&#39;re already hurting him. You could&#39;ve told him you were at Michiru&#39;s 
place. I still don&#39;t understand why you had to lie to him and make him 
worried about...well nothing.&quot; Rei said. She paused for a moment, 
waiting for Usagi to finally face her. When the blonde didn&#39;t look up 
nor move at all she decided just to go on.&quot;Usagi, I&#39;ve seen it in your 
eyes before. The love you feel or felt for Mamoru. It was real. You 
can&#39;t deny that. What is bothering me now is this simple question, did 
you manage to fool even me or is there someone else?&quot;

It took Usagi a couple of minutes to come over her shock. So Rei had 
figured out? Until now Usagi thought she had managed to keep it a 
secret.&quot;I never felt love for him. Only friendship.&quot; The blonde lied.&#39;Oh 
god...&#39; The blonde princess thought.&#39;I can&#39;t tell her...not her.&#39; Yes, 
Usagi had a crush on Rei Hino. That was something she had come to 
realise a long time ago. After seeing the raven haired senshi die by the 
hands of Galaxia. No, before that she had felt those similair feeling 
towards the other.

&quot;You can&#39;t hide stuff from me Usagi, so who is the lucky guy, Motoki, 
Seiya?&quot; Rei questioned. Luckily for Usagi it was dark inside of the room 
or else Rei would&#39;ve seen her blush out of embarrasment. Sure Rei was 
open minded but to find out that some chick had a crush on you couldn&#39;t 
leave that same impact of reaction.&quot;So who is it?&quot;

&quot;I have to go.&quot; Usagi stammered.&quot;Mamoru is waiting!&quot; And with that said 
she jumped up and hurried out of the room. Rei wanted to get up and stop 
the running blonde but decided not to follow her. Something told her 
that it was the best to leave Usagi alone for a while. This was 
obviously bothering Usagi.

When Usagi reached the car she found Mamoru talking to Setsuna. Next to 
Setsuna stood Haruka. This kind of surprised the blonde.&#39;I can&#39;t believe 
they have the guts to show up here after what they did to Michiru!&#39;

&quot;Ah Usako, look who stopped by.&quot; Mamoru said, turning his head to his 
fianc&eacute;e. Usagi nodded and faked a smile, looking up at the two women in 
front of her. It was obvious that Haruka and Setsuna had noticed the 
angered look in the blonde&#39;s eyes. Even Mamoru noticed, ofcourse he had 
no idea of what was going on.&quot;Uh they were looking for you Usako.&quot; He 
added, the tone in his voice was full of unasked questions.

&quot;Hey Usagi..&quot; Haruka said. She was kind of annoyed with Mamoru&#39;s 
presence at this time. Couldn&#39;t he feel that he was unwanted at this 
point. Ofcourse she had no idea of how unwanted he really was.&quot;We, me 
and Setsuna...We wanted to talk with you about...&quot; She paused, looking 
at the black haired guy who seemed to be waiting for her to continue.

&quot;I have nothing to say to you Haruka. What you did to Michiru is 
terrible. You just threw her away and broke her heart. You can&#39;t 
possibly know how she is feeling right now. She is crying Haruka and it 
is all because of you. You can&#39;t just play with someone&#39;s heart and then 
decide you had enough and break it, you&#39;re a selfish...&quot; Usagi stopped 
talking once she realised she was doing the exact same thing to Mamoru.

&quot;A selfish what, person?&quot; Haruka asked. It was written all over her face 
that she was obviously hurt by the small blonde&#39;s words but at the same 
time she seemed to be holding back her true opinion towards the princess 
in front of her.&quot;I know I am a selfish person, I know I hurt Michiru by 
leaving but staying with her would&#39;ve hurt her more...&quot; The tomboy 
finally said.

&quot;Haruka...&quot; Setsuna started but was cut off by Usagi.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Everyone looked down at the raging blonde in shock. This was 
the first time they had ever seen her this angry. When Usagi realised 
what she had just said and in what way she gazed down at the street.&quot;I 
am sorry...&quot; She whispered as a tear fell down her face.&#39;It&#39;s like 
Haruka is trying to show me I am doing wrong by staying with Mamoru.&#39;

The black haired man who had been sitting in the car quickly stepped out 
to hold his fianc&eacute;e. He was sure now that something was indeed bothering 
her.&quot;Usako..&quot; She whispered as he stroke her back. At this action she 
pulled away.

&quot;Don&#39;t touch me...&quot; She cried, stepping backwards.

Haruka and Setsuna watched this scence with shocked and surprised looks 
on their faces. This couldn&#39;t possibly be about Haruka breaking up with 
Michiru anymore. This was about something else.&quot;Usagi are you okay?&quot; The 
green haired woman tried as she stepped closer to the crying blonde.

Instead of letting Setsuna come nearer Usagi stepped back a few steps 
more. She was now standing in the middle of the street while looking at 
the three persons in front of her.&quot;Please just leave me alone.&quot; She then 
begged. Usagi didn&#39;t know what it was that had made her lose her calm 
and reserved facade but she did know she had ruined it now. There was no 
way she could ever lie out of this one.

&quot;Usagi, come back here.&quot; Haruka started.&quot;You have to realise that the 
position you are in is a very dangerous one. And I don&#39;t mean...ah just 
get off the street before some drunk driver decides to hit you at full 
speed.&quot; Usagi who was too busy trying to make up excuses for her 
behaviour didn&#39;t even hear the tomboy&#39;s warning nor words. Instead of 
that she managed to trip over a rock that lay on the street.

The fall seemed to make her realise where she was again. Ofcourse a bit 
too late. A car was driving into her direction at full speed and seemed 
to be unable to stop in time.&quot;Usagi!&quot; She could hear Haruka yell as she 
closed her eyes and waited for the car to hit her. Much to her surprise 
it never came. The only thing she felt was someone push her aside as she 
landed in the grass.

----

Michiru was lying on her bed, facing the ceiling once again. She didn&#39;t 
feel like watching television or going out. Everything she did and 
everywhere she went reminded her of her times with Haruka.&#39;I am so 
pathetic, she&#39;s probaby having sex with Setsuna at this point and here I 
am thinking of her and secretly wishing for her to come back to me...&#39;

Upon hearing the doorbell she sat up and looked at the alarm clock. It 
was past 9pm, who would visit her at this time of day? Deciding there 
was only one way to figure that out she stood up and started to head for 
the front door.

Slowly she opened the front door. It was only natural to be surprised 
upon seeing Usagi stand in front of her. Her eyes were swollen because 
she had obviously cried a lot. In fact she was still crying, she just 
didn&#39;t make a sound while doing it.&quot;Usagi, what&#39;s wrong? Come in!&quot; The 
aqua haired girl yelped as she took the blonde&#39;s hands in hers and lead 
her into the hall.

&quot;Just hold me..&quot; Usagi pleaded. Michiru just obeyed and put her arms 
around the smaller girl, holding her tightly.

After standing there in the hall for a couple of minutes Michiru finally 
pulled back a little, looking into the other&#39;s blue eyes with 
concern.&quot;What&#39;s the matter Usagi, did you tell Mamoru about..&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; The blonde cut the other off.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Michiru paused.&quot;Then what is the matter sweety?&quot;

Usagi pulled herself closer to the older woman again, burrying her head 
on the other&#39;s shoulder.&quot;I lost it.&quot; She sobbed.&quot;I couldn&#39;t take it 
anymore and...I am so sorry to bother you again but I didn&#39;t know where 
else to go and Rei found out about me and now Mamoru is hurt because, 
because he...and I am so confused. I just don&#39;t know anymore...&quot; She was 
now crying again.

To Michiru this didn&#39;t make any sence ofcourse but she knew better than 
to ask. Once again she put her arms around the crying girl.&quot;Shh it&#39;s 
ok.&quot; She whispered.&quot;It&#39;s ok. You&#39;re not bothering me at all you know 
that.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Usagi lied. She knew that Michiru had other things to do 
besides hearing her complain and cry all the time. With that thought on 
her mind she pulled back again. Stepping back until she reached the 
door, leaning against it.&quot;I am sorry Michiru, I shouldn&#39;t have come 
here.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright. I wasn&#39;t doing anything useful anyway. Why don&#39;t you 
come inside and I&#39;ll make us some tea and then you can tell me what 
exactly is bothering you.&quot; Michiru said with a smile on her face that 
made Usagi forget about her problems for a few seconds. Unconsciously 
Usagi just nodded as she followed the aqua haired girl into the 
livingroom where she sat down on the large chair next to the couch.

&quot;I don&#39;t really want tea.&quot; Usagi said when she saw Michiru head for the 
kitchen.&quot;I just need someone to talk to right now.&quot; She added.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Came the reply. Slowly Michiru turned around and walked back 
to the couch and sat down on it. She just sat there for a couple of 
moments, waiting for the blonde to start talking.

&quot;Mamoru is in hospital.&quot; Usagi finally said.&quot;I started crying and 
stepped onto the street and a car...it couldn&#39;t stop and I thought I was 
going to die so I just...&quot; Usagi was still crying but seemed to be able 
to speak very well at the same time.&quot;He pushed me aside only to get hit 
by the car himself...He saved me. I would&#39;ve been the one lying in that 
hospital bed right now but...but...since I never told him he saved me. 
He loves me and he...I should&#39;ve told him and..I would, no I should 
be..&quot;

&quot;Calm down Usagi.&quot; Michiru said, standing up to place her hand on the 
blonde&#39;s shoulder.&quot;Don&#39;t blame yourself. No one was holding a gun to his 
face and forcing him to rescue you. It was a noble thing of him to do.&quot; 
The aqua haired girl&#39;s words made Usagi feel guilty about leaving out 
that Haruka and Setsuna were there as well. They saw the whole scence.

Usagi shook her head.&quot;The docter says he is going to make it. He just 
needs rest and...I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t even found the courage to visit 
him. He must be waiting for me right now but...I can&#39;t face him Michiru. 
I just can&#39;t.&quot;

The other nodded. She could understand Usagi&#39;s point of view completely. 
If it had been her in Usagi&#39;s position and Haruka in Mamoru&#39;s she 
would&#39;ve probably hadn&#39;t had the courage to visit her either.&#39;There I go 
again, thinking of her!&#39; She scolded herself. &quot;I understand Usagi. You 
may not believe me but I can imagine how you must be feeling right now.&quot;

&quot;God is punishing me. Rei found out that there was something I like and 
a few moments after that Mamoru...&quot; She swallowed hard.&quot;Mamoru...&quot;

&quot;You like someone?&quot; Michiru asked. She had to admit that she was 
surprised upon hearing that.

Usagi nodded.&quot;I am not proud of it but yes. And don&#39;t ask me 
who...You&#39;ll act all shocked and say you&#39;d never thought of me like that 
and...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll never know how I will react if you don&#39;t try me.&quot; Michiru 
interrupted the other. She had to admit that Usagi was making her 
curious about this mysterious person she liked. But that wasn&#39;t the only 
thing, she was also glad that she had mananged to change the subject by 
asking her question. Usagi seemed to have less of a hard time with this 
subject than the other.

&quot;It&#39;s a woman...&quot; Usagi whispered. It was almost too inaudible but 
Michiru managed to figure out the other&#39;s words. Or atleast the &#39;female&#39; 
part.

&quot;I am not shocked and I did kind of expect it.&quot; Michiru said with an 
honest smile on her face that mananged to surprise the other.

&quot;You aren&#39;t and you did?&quot; Usagi asked, giving Michiru a &#39;please explain&#39; 
look.

The older woman giggled at that.&quot;It&#39;s Rei, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Usagi went wide eyed at this. How did she know, was it that obvious? 
Instead of replying with words she just nodded.&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I think no 
one else noticed it.&quot; The aqua haired girl said as if reading the 
blonde&#39;s mind.&quot;I can&#39;t explain it but let&#39;s just say that I knew 
somehow.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll be disgusted with me.&quot; Usagi whispered, looking down at the 
ground once more.

&quot;You&#39;re making a habit out of it.&quot; The other&#39;s voice came causing Usagi 
to look up again.

&quot;Out of what?&quot;

&quot;Assuming things. How can you know she&#39;ll be disgusted with you when you 
haven&#39;t even told her yet?&quot;

&quot;I just know.&quot; It was a childish reply. Even Usagi knew that but she 
couldn&#39;t help it. Part of her knew that Michiru was right on the other 
hand she didn&#39;t want to admit it. &quot;Besides even if she would be 
interested in me as well, I got no experience once so ever with...&quot;

&quot;Lesbian relationships?&quot; Michiru finished for her.

&quot;Yeah. Rei has dated a few girls in the past...&quot; Usagi got cut off at 
that point.

&quot;If she dated girls in the past then how can you be so stupid to assume 
she&#39;ll be disgusted with you?&quot;

&quot;No, No.&quot; Usagi quickly said.&quot;I didn&#39;t mean disgusted as in being a 
homophobe or anything. I meant...being disgusted with me for loving her. 
We fight a lot you know.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just too insecure if you ask me.&quot; The other stated as a matter 
of fact.

Usagi closed her eyes for a moment, wondering if she would or wouldn&#39;t 
ask the question that was on her mind ever since this subject came to 
the matter.&quot;C-can...can you...&quot; She paused again, not daring to look up 
until she felt the other&#39;s hands cup her face. Forcing her on this way 
to face her.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid to ask me for hints or help Usagi.&quot; Michiru 
started.&quot;You know I am willing to help you with all your ques...&quot;

&quot;Teach me.&quot; Usagi interrupted the other. Michiru was kind of shocked by 
this. Did Usagi mean that in the way she thought she did? Michiru 
swallowed, giving the other a questioning look.&quot;I mean...Teach me how to 
love a woman.&quot;

At first Michiru wanted to apologize to Usagi and say no but after 
giving it a second thought she decided otherwise.&quot;If I help 
you...Promise me that you&#39;ll be sincere with Mamoru and visit him in the 
hospital. Then, when you are sure you can tell Rei about yuor feelings.&quot;

Usagi nodded.&#39;She doesn&#39;t know what I meant.&#39; She then 
realised.&quot;Michiru...I didn&#39;t mean...&quot; She paused once more.

&quot;I know.&quot; Michiru whispered as she took a deep breath and offered Usagi 
her hand. After hesitating for a few moments Usagi took the other&#39;s hand 
and let herself being pulled up from the chair, straight into the 
other&#39;s arms. Michiru didn&#39;t seem to show any sign of doubt nor 
hesitation and just pressed her lips on those of Usagi. At this point 
she started getting doubts about this and when she was about to pull 
away again something inside of her stopped her from actually doing it.

Usagi had felt the same thing. At first all she could think of was how 
she was betraying Mamoru by kissing Michiru but when she wanted to pull 
back she was stopped. A voice in her mind screamed at her, begged her 
not to pull away from the kiss. And to be honest, Usagi didn&#39;t want to 
pull back.

Before any of them knew their kiss grew more passionate as if they were 
both trying to catch up with the love they had missed for quite some 
time. But that couldn&#39;t be possibly it. After all they weren&#39;t lovers, 
they weren&#39;t in love with one another. But why, why did this feel so 
good when it was so wrong? Michiru had now opened her mouth for the 
other&#39;s tongue to enter. For quite some time they had just stood there, 
letting eachother&#39;s tongues explore the other&#39;s mouth.

Both a bit out of breath they pulled back.&quot;Michiru...&quot; Usagi whispered, 
her voice sounded different than usual. Michiru couldn&#39;t quite explain 
it.

&quot;Usagi...&quot; Michiru started but before she could say anything else she 
felt Usagi&#39;s lips pressed to hers once more. Part of her wanted to stop 
this because to her it still felt like she was being unfaithful to 
Haruka, another part of her said the exact opposite. She needed to feel 
the warmth of someone next to her in the morning again, to feel loved.

The blonde who had totally forgotten about her problems slowly started 
to unbotton Michiru&#39;s white blouse until it dropped to the ground. They 
pulled back for a moment. Usagi&#39;s eyes examining the girl in front of 
her. Michiru was wearing a black strapless bra and was looking at her 
with a seductive look on her face as if she was asking Usagi to continue 
undressing her without using actual words.

This was wrong and they both knew it. They didn&#39;t know what had gotten 
into them but somehow, even though they knew this wasn&#39;t right, they 
weren&#39;t even trying to stop their actions. Instead of that it seemed 
like them knowing this for a fact was only making it worse.&#39;Are we that 
desperate to feel loved?&#39; Was the last thing Michiru could remember 
herself thinking before she completely gave into the feeling of...

Lust?

Love?

Or something else?

To Be Continued..

Ah that wasn&#39;t what you all had expected of it had you? To be honest, 
this chapter didn&#39;t quite go as I planned it myself. I found it hard to 
believe Usagi would do such a thing while Mamoru was in hospital but at 
the other hand I couldn&#39;t think of a better moment. People do strange 
things when they&#39;re put under a lot of stress or when they are confused. 
I hope this chapter gave all of you a better insight of the true 
emotions that are behind the facades the characters put up. As always, 
let me know what you think!

Ah and any bets on what is going to happen in the next chapter? No? I&#39;ll 
give you a hint, it has something to do with Haruka, Usagi and Michiru. 
Plus Mamoru&#39;s broken heart.</pre>
