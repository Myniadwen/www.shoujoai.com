<h1>Rainy Night</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tung.html">Tunguska</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A cool wind whipped around her as she slid the glass door open and stepped 
out onto the terrace. The large over hang protected her from the rain but a 
few random splats of cool water landed on her hands as they gripped the cast 
iron railing. The sky was black as the night rain poured down. She stared 
up into the sky expectantly, as if waiting for something. Almost as a 
response a jagged, white spear of lightning tore through the sky followed 
closely by the accompanying boom. The girl smiled, a few tendrils of her 
long brown hair falling down from her bangs and brushing against her nose. 
She reached up with a delicate hand and placed the errant strands behind her 
ear.

The sound of shifting sheets distracted her from staring into the dark rain 
and she turned to glance back into the room. The other girl was still 
there. The tall girl knew the other would still be there, but seeing the 
shifting covers caused a warmth to spread across her belly. She looked back 
up to the sky and another brilliant flash of light coursed across the 
rolling clouds. The flash lit up her emerald green eyes and briefly 
illuminated the light patch of blue hair that lay contentedly on the pillow. 
The tall brunette stepped back into the room and closed the door as 
quietly as she could. The other still slept. The girl ran a long graceful 
finger along the others hairline, careful not to disturb the sleeper. The 
other turned over, exposing her smooth rounded shoulders to the night air. 
Jade eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of the others bare skin. The 
burning in her belly spread into her chest and down into her pelvis. Part 
of her wanted to wake the sleeper, to take the dozing girl into her arms and 
make love to her again, as they had done not an hour ago. Another part of 
her wanted nothing more let her gaze wash over the sleeper as the covers 
rose and fell slightly with each breath.

The tall girl moved into the adjoining bathroom and closed the door behind 
her as she flipped on the light. She winced slightly against the harsh 
glare of the too-white light. She looked in the mirror and ran her hands 
over her belly. She felt her abdominals tense slightly and smirked as she 
watched her flat belly take on the line and sculpt that was a result of her 
training. The burning in her stomach refused to go away. One of the hands 
that rested on her belly trailed down her abdomen to brush against the soft 
tuft of hair. She gripped the edge of the sink tightly and leaned forward 
slightly while her other hand rubbed gently at her pearl. Her jaw clenched 
tightly and a sharp hiss squeezed out of her throat. She wanted to cry out, 
to call the name of the lover that paraded through her mind but that lover 
was asleep in the other room and she wanted to let her sleep. She let go of 
the sink and began lightly pinching one of her swollen nipples as she 
slipped a pair of fingers into her tunnel. Her legs grew weak and she 
dropped to her knees and let her head droop onto the edge of the sink. She 
dug deeper into her tunnel and began to pull and pinch at her nipples harder 
than before. Her breathing became ragged and harsh as she tried desperately 
to quench the fire that burned within her. Despite her efforts to control 
herself, small gasps and groans began to seep out of her mouth as she drove 
toward her finish as hard as she could. As she reached release she called 
to her, the name sprang from her mouth and echoed off the linoleum walls of 
the small bathroom. Her blood thundered through her veins and deafened her 
to the sound of the bathroom door opening. Her eyes focused on the floor 
beneath her and the small pool of fluid that she sat in. A familiar foot 
came into view as the girl who was once sleeping stepped up close to her 
panting body. A familiar voice said her name and she looked up, her green 
eyes locking into blue.

&quot;Ami-chan.&quot; Said the brunette softly as she recovered her breath.

&quot;Mako-chan, come to bed.&quot; Said the blue haired girl as she rubbed some of 
the sleep out of her eyes.

&quot;Did I wake you?&quot; Asked Makoto as she struggled to get up.

&quot;Sort of, you didn&#39;t have to do this in here. You know it doesn&#39;t bother 
me when you do that.&quot; Said Ami.

&quot;I know, I just thought you looked really cute all curled up in the covers 
like that.&quot; Said Makoto as she turned on the faucet and began to wash her 
hands.

&quot;Okay, but come to bed now okay?&quot; Said Ami as she turned and walked back 
to the large empty bed.

&quot;I&#39;ll be right in Ami-chan, just let me clean up.&quot; Said Makoto as she 
finished washing her hands and began drying them on one of the stiff hotel 
towels. She flipped off the light and walked into the dark bedroom slowly, 
feeling for the edge of the bed carefully with each step. She found it and 
crawled under the covers to lie next to her blue-haired lover. Ami was 
lying on her side and Makoto curled around her, throwing an arm over her 
waist and slipping the other under her neck. Ami nuzzled into Makoto&#39;s 
arm and held it against her chest.

&quot;I love you Mako-chan.&quot; Said Ami as she laid a soft kiss on Makoto&#39;s 
bicep. Makoto remained silent and pulled Ami to her tightly. They lay 
there for a time, each reveling in the other warmth and touch until at last 
sleep claimed them and their minds drifted into dreams of things to come.
