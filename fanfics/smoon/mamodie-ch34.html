-Special announcement-

Orchestral music begins to play as the camera pans down to a pair of 
smiling cats. The white one is wearing a bow tie as the black one 
elegantly sports a pearl necklace around her neck.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Artemis said cheerfully, &quot;And welcome one and all to the second 
to the last chapter of Mamoru Must Die!&quot;

&quot;Yes, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Luna spoke up, &quot;On March third, 2006, a 
small little story about Tuxedo Kamen getting kicked in the testicles by 
a little girl and subsequently being plowed over by a Mac truck was 
first published.&quot;

&quot;Since then,&quot; Artemis added, &quot;Mamoru has been fried, electrocuted, beat 
to death, crushed, thrown out of windows, run over, and impaled. It&#39;s 
been a wonderful ride, and we...&quot; Artemis stopped as several voices were 
heard off screen in a heated debate, &quot;What in th...&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Luna shouted as the camera began to pan to the side of the stage 
to see what all the commotion was about, &quot;Do you jerks mind? We&#39;re 
trying to introduce the omake!&quot; she yelled as three figures were now 
seen on the stage.&quot;

......

&quot;...I&#39;m telling you, it was weird!&quot; Miki said, &quot;I mean, think about it; 
they&#39;re naked, driving off to find their destiny, and they have no 
nipples! How would you explain that?&quot;

&quot;Humph,&quot; Saionji said derisively, &quot;Let me think... Oh I don&#39;t know, how 
about the censors?&quot;

&quot;No, no, no!&quot; a woman&#39;s voice shouted. The three duelists looked down to 
see Luna staring at them angrily.

&quot;Hey look,&quot; Touga said with an amused expression, &quot;A talking cat.&quot;

&quot;Luna!&quot; Artemis whined as he ran over, &quot;What are you doing? Why on earth 
are you getting into a discussion with these...&quot;

&quot;Feeble minded fools,&quot; Luna said as she ignored Artemis&#39; pleas, &quot;The 
missing nipples clearly signified their newfound freedom! Don&#39;t you see 
that nipples in anime always mean either imminent death at the hands of 
the patriarchy (see: Read or Die), imminent rape at the hands of the 
patriarchy (or some female relation of some sort) (see any hentai, 
ever), or that you are stuck in some god awful harem anime/ero game, in 
which case you are already being exploited by the patriarchy (Otaku) and 
will never be free! Why do you think the Amazons always cut one off? To 
fire a bow? Hah! Naive! The fact they have no nipples clearly means they 
are now free from male oppression, to live and love as they wish.&quot;

There was silence for several seconds after that, then, &quot;Oh great,&quot; 
Saionji spat snidely, &quot;One of those &#39;women&#39;s rights&#39; people.&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; Miki piped in &quot;I think they prefer &#39;womyn.&#39;&quot; he said, 
visibly wincing as images of Amazons cutting off nipples came unbidden 
into his head.

&quot;You know,&quot; Touga chimed in, &quot;It brings up an interesting question; if 
no nipples make them free to love as they wish, doesn&#39;t that cut off one 
avenue of sexual gratification?&quot;

&quot;Touga,&quot; Saionji said, &quot;Your mind&#39;s in the gutter again.&quot;

&quot;Well wait a sec,&quot; Miki said, &quot;If no nipples stands for freedom to live 
and love as one wishes, why did Shiori have no nipples in that scene 
where she turned into a butterfly in the cabbage patch? I mean, wasn&#39;t 
she more of a prisoner to her memories of you?&quot; he asked Touga, &quot;Also, 
since it&#39;s only the female characters who don&#39;t show their nipples, 
since in that one scene with you and Shiori where your shirt&#39;s open you 
clearly have a nipple showing, couldn&#39;t it be seen more as a form of 
oppression against the women of Ohtori than some sort of symbol of 
freedom? Sort of like &#39;Only guys are cool enough to have nipples around 
here,&#39; you know?&quot;

Saionji and Touga stared blankly at Miki for a few minutes before the 
green haired duelist clutched the sides of his head.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; he yelled, &quot;You&#39;ve given me a headache again!&quot;

&quot;Hello, Juri,&quot; Touga spoke into his cell phone, &quot;Touga again, I... Yeah, 
I know it&#39;s the middle of happy hour at the Locket, but could Saionji, 
Miki and I borrow you again for a bit. See, we...&quot; he then began to 
whisper something into the phone.

&quot;What?&quot; Juri yelled loud enough for everyone to hear her voice over the 
phone, &quot;No I&#39;m not going to let you three idiots look to see if I have 
any nipples!&quot;

Click!

&quot;Sheesh,&quot; Miki muttered as Artemis grabbed a cell phone of his own and 
began speaking into it, &quot;She seemed a bit testy, didn&#39;t she? I... Wait a 
second,&quot; he said as his eyes suddenly widened, &quot;I just remembered; at 
the end of Sailor Stars, when Sailor Moon and Galaxia are floating above 
the ground naked, they didn&#39;t have any nipples either.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Touga asked as a hook at the end of a long pole started to 
appear from off stage, &quot;I never knew that, I...&quot; Touga was violently cut 
off as Saionji, Miki and himself were yanked off the stage by the hook.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Luna said, &quot;What was that about?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Artemis said with a smile, &quot;I just got off the phone with the 
author, and he yanked those Ohtori jerks out of the story,&quot; he explained 
as he turned back to the camera, &quot;And now, without further ado, we 
present the second to the last omake. And it&#39;s another long one, folks. 
Enjoy.

-Omake Thirty Four-

-It&#39;s A Wonderful Senshi&#39;s Life-

------

&quot;Please,&quot; Usagi wept, tears falling down her cheeks as she looked up at 
the stars through the snowfall outside her bedroom window, &quot;Kami-sama, 
help Rei... Oh, if only I&#39;d known,&quot; she said as her voice cracked, 
&quot;Please, Kami-sama...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the praying kind,&quot; Haruka muttered as she stood outside alone 
as the snow gently fell all around her, &quot;But she was willing to marry 
Michiru and me when everybody else we went to told us we were wrong and 
evil for loving one another. She needs help, Kami-sama...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s helped us all so much,&quot; Makoto said, wiping at her tears as she 
leaned her back against a tree out in front of Usagi&#39;s residence, &quot;I... 
I&#39;ve never seen her so down...&quot;

&quot;Kami-sama...&quot;

&quot;...Rei, please Kami-sama...&quot;

&quot;Help her Kami...&quot;

......

All throughout the neighborhood, both Inner and Outer Senshi, as well as 
the guardian cats, looked up to the skies in concern for their friend 
and fellow Senshi. Their prayers and pleas rose up, past the clouds and 
beyond the stars until they reached a benevolent being older than time 
itself.

&quot;My goodness...&quot; a female&#39;s voice said, &quot;There certainly are a lot of 
prayers being offered up for Hino Rei-chan tonight. Well, something must 
be done about this,&quot; she decided as she sent out a call. A few seconds 
later, a spirit appeared before Her.

&quot;Yes, Kami-sama,&quot; a woman&#39;s voice asked.

&quot;There&#39;s trouble down on earth,&quot; Kami explained, &quot;A young woman by the 
name of Hino Rei has given into despair, and is thinking of throwing 
away Heaven&#39;s most precious gift.&quot;

&quot;Not her life!&quot; the spirit asked frantically, &quot;I&#39;ll go down immediately 
and...&quot;

&quot;Whoa, hold on there,&quot; Kami ordered, &quot;Before you go charging in, you 
need to know why this young woman would be thinking of committing 
suicide on Christmas eve,&quot; She said as everything began to grow fuzzy.

&quot;Kami-sama,&quot; the female spirit said in alarm, &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;

&quot;Relax,&quot; Kami said gently, &quot;It&#39;s just a flashback.&quot;

-Earlier That Day-

Christmas Eve at Usagi&#39;s house was a joyous affair as both Inner and 
Outer Senshi filled the living room during the informal Christmas party. 
As everyone cheered Haruka and Michiru under the mistletoe, Makoto took 
Ami aside nervously.

&quot;Ami-chan,&quot; the taller young woman said, &quot;We... We&#39;ve been going steady 
for a while now. Ever since omake eight, in fact.&quot;

&quot;Fourth wall,&quot; Ami chided with a smile. Her smile quickly disappeared as 
she noticed that her girlfriend looked a bit fearful, &quot;Mako-chan, what&#39;s 
wrong?&quot; she asked apprehensively.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Makoto began, suddenly getting the attention of everyone else in 
the room as she dropped to one knee and pulled out a diamond ring, 
&quot;Would... Would you marry me?&quot;

Ami&#39;s jaw fell open at that. With tears in her eyes, she nodded yes. As 
the guests applauded for the two, Makoto placed the engagement ring on 
her finger and pulled her into an embrace.

A short time later, Makoto walked over to where Rei was standing with 
Usagi and Minako. She grabbed the raven-haired woman and took her into 
the kitchen.

&quot;It worked,&quot; Makoto gushed, &quot;You were right; she said yes!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so happy for both of you,&quot; Rei said as she hugged her friend. As 
they separated, Makoto looked more seriously at her.

&quot;You haven&#39;t told her yet, have you?&quot; she asked disappointedly.

&quot;No, and I don&#39;t intend to,&quot; Rei said sadly, &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be right. 
She&#39;s with Mamoru...&quot;

&quot;Did you write another one this year?&quot; Makoto asked. Every year around 
this time, Rei bought a Christmas card and pour out all her feelings for 
Usagi. She never gave them to the blonde, of course, but it helped to at 
least get it temporarily out of her system.

Rei nodded, &quot;Yes,&quot; she muttered, &quot;It helps a bit to deal with the pain.&quot;

Makoto frowned, &quot;Rei-chan, you really should tell her. You...&quot;

&quot;Here you are,&quot; Hotaru said as she poked her head into the kitchen, 
&quot;Come on; Usagi and Mamoru are about to open everyone&#39;s cards.&quot;

The two went into the other room as Mamoru blindly picked a card from 
the pile on the small end table next to her, &quot;Let&#39;s see, &#145;Dear Usagi, 
Peace on earth, and good will to keep the doctor away,&#39; Aaw, thanks 
Mina-chan,&quot; she said as she gave a hug to her fellow blonde.

&quot;Here&#39;s one to me,&quot; Mamoru said with a smile, &quot;&#39;Dear Mamoru, Merry 
Christmas, and congratulations on being able to give our Usagi the big 
one every night,&#39;&quot; he finished as his face turned red.

&quot;Oof!&quot; Haruka said as Michiru elbowed her in the ribs.

&quot;Baka,&quot; the artist growled, &quot;I thought you said you weren&#39;t really going 
to give that one out.&quot;

&quot;Ow, that hurt,&quot; the sandy-haired Senshi complained as Usagi grabbed the 
next card.

&quot;Let&#39;s see... &#145;Dearest Usagi, If only you knew how my heart ached for 
you...&#39;&quot;

Rei felt her stomach sink as she realized she&#39;d put the wrong card in 
Usagi&#39;s envelope. As she began to hyperventilate, an amused Mamoru took 
the card from his fianc&eacute;e.

&quot;Let me see that,&quot; he said with a chuckle, &quot;&#39;Your beautiful blue eyes, 
childlike and innocent, hold me prisoner whenever they meet mine. I long 
for the touch of your lips, for the bushing of skin upon skin, for you 
to look at me and tell me you love me...&#39; Wow, whoever this is sure has 
a crush on you,&quot; Mamoru laughed.

Makoto looked over and could see Rei&#39;s face turning bright red, and her 
eyes starting to tear up, &quot;Mamo-kun,&quot; the Senshi of Lightning 
interrupted, &quot;Please don&#39;t read anymore, you shouldn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;&#39;...Being even in the same room with you is a slow torture,&#39;&quot; he read 
on, &quot;&#39;Knowing I love you with all my heart, yet can never have you. I&#39;ll 
always love you though, and always, always hope that someday, somehow, 
you&#39;ll be mine. Love, Rei,&#39;&quot; he finished, laughing at he did so. He 
looked up, only to see that he was the only one laughing.

Tears were now running in small rivulets down Rei&#39;s face, and she had a 
pained expression on her face. She began to back up towards the front 
door.

&quot;Rei-chan,&quot; Usagi said, &quot;Wait, please!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t go,&quot; Makoto added, concerned over the look of total devastation 
in her fellow Senshi&#39;s eyes, &quot;Not like this, please...&quot;

Rei wasn&#39;t listening anymore. She turned and ran sobbing out the front 
door into the cold winter night. By the time her friends made it to the 
door, she was already gone from sight.

-The Present-

As Rei had run from Usagi&#39;s residence, she&#39;d slipped and fell, cutting 
her lower lip open a bit. She was now standing on a bridge looking over 
its side at the river below. She was cold, heart-broken and humiliated. 
There was no way she could ever show her face around her fellow Senshi 
again, especially Usagi.

As a mysterious figure appeared behind her, Rei wiped another tear away 
as she continued to look down into the waters below. It would be so 
easy; jump in, let the cold water surround you, and end the whole sordid 
affair.

Rei was pulled out of her dark thoughts as someone nearby fell off the 
bridge and landed in the water.

SPLASH!

&quot;Help!&quot; the woman cried out as she waved her arms around, &quot;Somebody help 
me!&quot;

Almost by instinct, Rei put her own problems aside as she focused on 
another person in distress. She dove into the freezing cold water, 
grabbed the other woman and pulled her to shore.

A short time later, Rei found herself shivering in a cabin by the 
riverbank, a blanket pulled tightly around her as she sat across from 
the stranger.

&quot;Br-r-r-r...&quot; Rei stuttered out as she shook all over, &quot;I&#39;m 
f-f-freezing.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; the stranger said with an odd smile, &quot;I can see you&#39;re 
shivering.&quot;

&quot;I... I wouldn&#39;t be here sh-sh-shivering if you hadn&#39;t been clumsy 
enough to f-f-fall off the bridge.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t fall in,&quot; the attractive young woman said, &quot;I jumped in to 
save you.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Rei asked as she raised an eyebrow, &quot;What k-k-kind of a n-n-nut 
are you?&quot;

&quot;Well, you were planning to jump off yourself and commit suicide weren&#39;t 
you?&quot; she asked, narrowing her beautiful eyes as she glared at the young 
woman before her, &quot;I took a chance that, being a Senshi, the hero in you 
would kick in and make you try to save me.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes widened in fear; this woman wasn&#39;t just a lunatic, but a 
lunatic who knew she was a Senshi! It was then she noticed it; while she 
was still cold, wet and shivering, the stranger&#39;s clothes were 
completely dry.

&quot;Wh-who are y-y-you?&quot; she asked. In answer, the woman stood up before 
her and smiled.

&quot;Heyyyy,&quot; she said, sticking her thumbs up in the air as her toga 
rustled a bit under her leather jacket, &quot;I&#39;m your guardian angel.&quot;

Rei tilted her head a bit at that, &quot;My what?&quot;

&quot;Your guardian angel,&quot; the woman repeated, &quot;The name&#39;s Sappho, and I&#39;m 
here to give you some help-a-mundo!&quot; she said, adding, &quot;As well as pull 
this depressing little story out of the dumps.&quot;

&quot;Terrific,&quot; Rei muttered to herself, &quot;She&#39;s nuts, she knows I&#39;m a 
Senshi, and she thinks she&#39;s an angel.&quot;

&quot;Now then,&quot; the angel said as she sat back down, &quot;You were thinking of 
suicide, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

Rei took a deep breath, looked down at the ground and nodded her head 
sadly.

Sappho shook her head as she looked at the dejected young lady before 
her, &quot;How could you?&quot; she asked, &quot;You have so many friends, so many 
people who care about you...&quot;

&quot;Not the one I want to,&quot; Rei quipped, &quot;At least not the way I wished 
she&#39;d care.&quot;

&quot;And you think suicide&#39;s going to help anything?&quot; the angel asked 
pointedly, &quot;You know those left behind would be devastated.&quot;

&quot;I suppose... You know,&quot; Rei said as a tear slowly made its way down her 
cheek, &quot;Maybe it would be better if I&#39;d never been born.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Sappho asked, &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right? I mean, that sort of 
thinking isn&#39;t cool.&quot;

Rei looked angrily at the woman in the leather jacket in front of her, 
&quot;Shut up!&quot; she snapped, &quot;You don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going through! I&#39;m dead 
serious; I wish I was never born!&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Sappho said, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t... No wait, wait just one moment,&quot; 
the angel said thoughtfully. She looked up, and a mysterious smile 
suddenly appeared on her face, &quot;Very well,&quot; she said as she looked back 
over to the raven-haired woman sitting before her and snapped her 
fingers, &quot;Your wish has been granted,&quot; she informed her as the door to 
the small cabin they were in suddenly blew inward dramatically, thunder 
roaring as lightning flashed outside.

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Heyyyy, you got your wish,&quot; Sappho repeated, an intense look in the 
lovely angel&#39;s face as she leaned forward towards the Senshi of Fire, 
&quot;You&#39;ve never been born.&quot;

Rei was about to answer back with something witty, when she noticed 
something, &quot;My clothes,&quot; she gasped, &quot;They&#39;re dry!&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot; the angel answered, &quot;And your lower lip is no longer bleeding 
either.&quot;

&quot;Wha...&quot; Rei began, feeling her lower lip, &quot;But... but I slipped on the 
ice, I... Okay, this is weirding me out. I&#39;m going back to the shrine. 
Hey, Saffron...&quot;

&quot;Sappho.&quot; The angel corrected irritatedly, &quot;I&#39;m the Sappho...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, whatever. Look, you got anyplace to stay?&quot;

&quot;Oh, well I...&quot;

&quot;(sigh) Come on then. I&#39;ll have my grandfather put you up for a bit,&quot; 
she said as she and the angel walked out into the night. As they walked 
to Rei&#39;s grandfather&#39;s shrine, they passed a small group standing 
outside a nearby nightclub...

......

&quot;Does Juri have nipples?&quot; Setsuna repeated, staring incredulously at the 
trio. &quot;That&#39;s a little...personal, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;re having an argument and...,&quot; Miki murmured out, shrugging as 
he did so.

&quot;...And you thought to ask me a question I&#39;m not going to answer?&quot; the 
green-haired woman finished, looking pointedly at the blue-haired male. 
&quot;You&#39;ll have a better chance of getting the answer from Utena.&quot;

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s a good idea!&quot; Touga crowed excitedly.

Setsuna just stared as the trio ran off. &quot;I think Ohtori damaged 
something in their heads,&quot; she said, shaking her head.

......

About a block away from the shrine, Rei and Sappho watched a man and 
woman walking down the opposite sidewalk hand in hand, a second woman 
tailing behind then. Suddenly the man slipped on a patch of ice and fell 
into the oncoming path of a snow plow. As his girlfriend began to cry, 
the other woman took her in her arms to comfort her.

Sappho smiled happily, &quot;See that?&quot; she asked blissfully, &quot;Every time a 
dumbass gets killed, a lesbian couple is born,&quot; she turned to look at 
Rei, only to see the raven-haired beauty looking deeply troubled.

&quot;I just reached for my henshin wand,&quot; she gasped, &quot;To save him. But... 
But I couldn&#39;t find it. It&#39;s not on me!&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Sappho answered, &quot;You don&#39;t have a henshin wand. 
There&#39;s no Sailor Mars here, because there&#39;s no Hino Rei.&quot;

Rei slowly digested that bit of news as they at last reached the Shinto 
shrine. The grounds however appeared to be a mess, which troubled the 
Senshi of Fire deeply. She knocked on the door, and waited for an 
answer. After a few minutes, a young man answered the door.

&quot;Humph,&quot; Yuuichirou Kumada murmured, &quot;It&#39;s about time I had a role in 
one of these.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Oh, nothing. Who are you, and what do you want?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here to see my grandfather,&quot; Rei said crossly, &quot;And what do you 
mean &#145;who are you?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Grandfather?&quot; Yuuichirou asked, &quot;You mean that dirty old man that&#39;s 
always chasing skirts? He&#39;s probably off in town somewhere getting drunk 
again. Now go away!&quot; he ordered as he slammed the door in the 
raven-haired woman&#39;s face.

Rei was stunned, &quot;He... He&#39;s never talked that way to me before,&quot; she 
stammered out as the snow began to once again drift from the sky.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Sappho said as she placed an understanding hand on her shoulder, 
&quot;Let me give you a word of advice-a-mundo. You see, you&#39;re going to be 
seeing a lot of stuff that&#39;s not normal. As I keep reminding you, you 
don&#39;t exist anymore.&quot;

A short time later, the two made their way into the city. That&#39;s when 
Rei noticed the sign.

&quot;Welcome to Berylsville?&quot; she asked, &quot;But... But wait, this is Tokyo!&quot;

&quot;Wrong,&quot; Sappho corrected her, &quot;This was Tokyo. Usagi and the other 
Inners were too weak to defeat Beryl&#39;s forces, because you weren&#39;t there 
to help them. Then of course there were the subsequent invasions, the 
rise of Mistress Nine, the Dark Moon Kingdom, and Galaxia. Each one 
subsequently cutting off large lands and continents for their own 
empires...&quot;

&quot;But... But what about...&quot;

&quot;The Outers?&quot; Sappho said, finishing the other&#39;s question before she 
could form it, &quot;They didn&#39;t manifest until it was too late.&quot;

&quot;There she is!&quot; somebody nearby yelled. Rei and her guide turned just in 
time to see a woman have apples flung at her by an angry group of 
people.

&quot;It&#39;s your fault!&quot; someone yelled.

&quot;We&#39;re all slaves because of you and your loser friends!&quot; another 
yelled.

As the group ran off, Rei ran up to the woman. She was dressed in soiled 
rags, and her hair was dull and unkempt.

&quot;Minako!&quot; Rei gasped.

The blonde looked up at her through bloodshot eyes, wiping the apple off 
with one hand as she clung to a bottle in a paper bag with another. She 
then stumbled off, taking a swig from her booze as she made her way away 
from Rei.

The dark-haired woman followed though, &quot;Mina-chan, wait! It&#39;s me, Rei. 
Don&#39;t... Don&#39;t you know me?&quot;

Minako looked back over to her, and slowly shook her head, &quot;No,&quot; she 
muttered, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen you before in my life,&quot; she said as she 
turned away again and headed off.

Rei turned heartbrokenly to her guide, &quot;Are... Are they all like this?&quot;

&quot;All the ones that survived pretty much.&quot; Sappho replied. As Rei looked 
away, she continued, &quot;Rei, you really did have a wonderful life. Can&#39;t 
you see now how wrong it would be to throw that all away?&quot;

Rei looked up now at the angel, &quot;Usagi,&quot; she muttered, &quot;What... What 
about Usagi?&quot;

Sappho looked away quickly, &quot;Usagi? Well, I... I&#39;m not supposed to show 
you that, I...&quot;

&quot;Look!&quot; Rei shrieked as she grabbed the collar of the angel&#39;s leather 
jacket, &quot;I need to know, damn it! Where is she?&quot;

Sappho sighed a bit, &quot;Over there around the corner,&quot; she said. Rei ran 
down the sidewalk and rounded the corner, only to stop when she saw what 
was before her.

There was Usagi, skinnier and dirtier than she&#39;d ever seen her, 
rummaging through a trash can with Luna.

&quot;Ooh, look,&quot; the blonde said with a smile, &quot;This still looks edible,&quot; 
she said hopefully.

Luna made a face, &quot;Yuck! Usagi, there are maggots crawling all over 
that,&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah, maybe. But if you sweep them off it&#39;s still good.&quot;

Rei couldn&#39;t believe it. Somehow, in the midst of all this, Usagi still 
was trying to seek out the bright side of the situation.

&quot;Hey!&quot; someone yelled from the shadows. A second later a homeless pair 
of waifs came into the light.

&quot;How many times do we have to tell you?&quot; Michiru shrieked, her eyes sunk 
in, &quot;This is our section of the street, now clear off.&quot;

&quot;Wha... This is a public road!&quot; Usagi shot back, &quot;I can do whatever 
I...&quot;

SMACK!

Usagi clutched her face painfully as she staggered back.

&quot;You&#39;ll get another,&quot; Haruka now snarled as she stepped forward to stand 
next to Michiru, &quot;If you don&#39;t keep off our territory!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Rei cried out, running towards the group, &quot;Leave her alone, 
you...&quot; her voice died away as the women, thinking they were about to be 
busted, all ran away, &quot;No, wait! Usagi, wait!&quot; she cried out, but to no 
avail. She then ran back to where her guardian angel was, but found her 
no longer waiting there.

&quot;Sappho!&quot; Rei yelled out as she ran through Berylsville back to the 
bridge. On the bridge, she began to weep as she sank to her knees, 
&quot;Sappho, please... Help me. Let me live again,&quot; she wept, &quot;I want to 
live again, please...&quot; she managed to get out as she began to shiver in 
the cold.

&quot;Rei,&quot; a concerned voice called out, &quot;Rei-chan, where are you?&quot;

&quot;Look,&quot; someone else said, &quot;Over there, on the bridge.&quot;

Rei continued to sob until she heard footsteps nearby crunching the soft 
snow.

&quot;Rei-chan!&quot; an overjoyed Michiru cried.

&quot;You had Michi-chan and I worried sick, I...&quot;

&quot;Get back!&quot; Rei growled out as she stood up, her hands balling up into 
fists, &quot;I don&#39;t care if you do think you own the street, I...&quot;

&quot;Own the street?&quot; Michiru asked confused.

&quot;Rei-chan,&quot; Haruka asked, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;I... Rei-chan? You... You both know me?&quot;

&quot;Know you?&quot; Haruka asked, &quot;Why, we and the other Senshi have been 
searching everywhere for you, I... hey, what happened to your lower lip? 
It&#39;s bleeding?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked excitedly as she put her hand up to her lip, &quot;Ha, ha! 
My mouth&#39;s bleeding!&quot; she shouted joyously, &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; she 
shrieked as she pulled the confused couple into a group hug before 
running off.

&quot;Merry Christmas Tokyo!&quot; Rei yelled as she ran through the streets 
towards Usagi&#39;s house, &quot;Merry Christmas Shrine! Usagi!&quot; she called out 
as she breathlessly reached her friends block.

------

&quot;Don&#39;t cry Usagi-chan,&quot; Ami said as Makoto and she held the blonde on 
the couch, &quot;We&#39;ll find her.&quot;

Setsuna and Minako came into the house along with Chibi Usa and Hotaru, 
&quot;Usagi-chan,&quot; the Time Senshi said sadly, &quot;We tried, but we couldn&#39;t 
find her.&quot;

&quot;Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama are still out looking,&quot; Hotaru said, 
trying to sound hopeful as Mamoru entered the room with a large box of 
ornaments to decorate the Christmas tree with. He frowned as he felt 
everyone&#39;s angry looks on him.

&quot;Look,&quot; Mamoru said as he set a small step stool up next to the tree, 
&quot;It&#39;s not my fault she over reacted. Besides, I&#39;m the victim here. I&#39;m 
the one who has to deal with a woman with a lesbian crush on my 
fianc&eacute;e.&quot;

Everyone just scowled at him angrier. Shrugging his shoulders, he 
grabbed the large metal star out of the box and began to climb up the 
stool to place it on the top of the tree when the front door flung open.

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Rei cried out as she rushed into the house. Usagi, ignoring 
everyone else in the room, rushed into her arms.

&quot;I... I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Rei wept, &quot;I never meant to give you that card, or 
tell you such embarrassing things. You... You must hate me, I know, 
but...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t hate you,&quot; Usagi answered.

&quot;What?&quot; Mamoru asked irritably as he was reaching up with the star in 
his hand.

&quot;I, I love you too,&quot; Usagi admitted, &quot;I just couldn&#39;t bear the thought 
of how sad and hopeless you looked when you left here.&quot;

&quot;Usagi-chan,&quot; Rei whispered as she cupped the blonde&#39;s cheeks in her 
hands, &quot;Do you really mean it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a miracle!&quot; Minako sighed happily.

Rei and Usagi looked lovingly into each other&#39;s eyes as they began to 
lean forward to kiss.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Mamoru yelled out irritably as Haruka and Michiru entered the 
house, &quot;What the hell&#39;s wrong with you people? She&#39;s already engaged to 
me, I... I...&quot; it was then that Mamoru lost his balance on the step 
stool and fell backwards while still holding the metal star. Which was 
unfortunate, since when he landed the star went into the local 
electrical outlet.

ZAP!

Then, to add insult to injury, the Christmas tree fell on top of 
Mamoru&#39;s corpse.

As everyone gathered around his body, Rei saw something in the branches 
of the tree. It was a book of erotic lesbian fiction. As she opened the 
cover, she saw a short inscription.

&quot;Dear Rei, Always remember; chicks dig the poems. Heyyyy, Sappho.&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; Usagi asked as she read the inscription over the 
raven-haired beauty&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Who&#39;s Sappho?&quot;

&quot;A very dear friend,&quot; Rei answered with a tender smile.

&quot;Look everyone,&quot; Chibi Usa said as she pointed at Mamoru&#39;s body, &quot;My 
future mommy says that every time a dumbass gets killed, a lesbian 
couple is born.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Rei answered as she pulled Usagi toward her, the two 
kissing each other tenderly as their friends looked on approvingly and 
the snow fell gently outside the house.

-Epilogue-

At a prestigious Tokyo research facility, a door opened to reveal a very 
familiar looking young genius with blue hair.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Ami said as she looked at the research material in front of her, 
&quot;From careful studies, here&#39;s what we can determine; at the climax of 
Sailor Stars, both Galaxia and Sailor Moon were in their Senshi forms, 
so it&#39;s probable that the same enchantment that keeps others from being 
able to recognize them when they&#39;re transformed also has the strange 
side effect of hiding their nipples.&quot;

&quot;In the case of the Utena movie,&quot; Ami continued as she leafed through 
the papers in her hands, &quot;Since Shiori turned into some sort of 
human/butterfly hybrid, and since insects don&#39;t lactate, her missing 
nipples are easy enough to explain away.&quot;

&quot;Which of course brings us back to Utena and Anthy. One possible 
explanation could be a side effect of the power of Dios, but the other 
of course is that it is allegorical in nature. They had just left the 
make-believe world of Ohtori Academy to enter the real world, but as a 
way to symbolize the emotional scars they must still overcome they are 
shown to be incomplete, i.e. no nipples. Together, they will thus find 
their own roads, face their fears and, eventually, through their love 
for one another they will heal and become whole once again and grow back 
their nipples. Oh,&quot; she quickly added, &quot;And yes, much to the relief of 
Setsuna, it does turn out that Juri has nipples. Being a private person 
as well as a lesbian, however, she wasn&#39;t about to show them off to 
those three baka Touga, Saionji and Miki.&quot;

Ami then closed her research file, bowed, and walked back into the 
research facility, all the while looking at her new engagement ring 
while humming &quot;Here comes the bride&quot; to herself.
