<h1>The Return of Sailor V (part 13 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sailorjane.html">SailorJane</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/returnsailorv-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>THE FIRE ESCAPE 

Sirens echoing down the street became louder and louder. The sirens caused the taciturn 
crowd to become more vocal. Sollozzo couldn&#39;t help but take his eyes off of Sailor Moon as 
he watched the mob separate like the Red Sea. A cop car sped towards him. 

Sailor Moon took advantage of the distraction. She grabbed her moon wand from under 
Sollozzo&#39;s foot causing him to trip slightly. She immediately dove in front of her friends 
and held her wand up. Bullets immediately fired out of the AK-47s Sollozzo&#39;s henchmen were 
carrying. The scouts recoiled instinctively. When their eyes opened, a protective shield 
emitted from Sailor Moon&#39;s wand. Luna stood up shaken, but relieved. 

The doors to the police car flew open to reveal officers Dante and Sirico. They both 
crouched behind the doors and took out their guns. They fired at Sollozzo&#39;s men knocking 
the AK-47s right out of their hands. The shots were non-lethal, but enough to force all of 
them to the ground. 

Sailor Moon and her friends watched the police officers run out with guns in hand. Sollozzo 
ran onto the fire escape of the building. 

Dozens of sirens sounded off as the mob grew more wild. Soon, dozens of members of the NYPD 
ran out of police vans into the streets to break up the mob. They didn&#39;t go down easy, and 
the criminals began to go right after them. The policemen were all accessorized with 
riot-gear: helmets and batons. Some carried guns, but Dante reaffirmed their mission: 

&quot;Hold fire for now!&quot; Dante shouted and looked over at the Sailor Scouts. He and Sirico ran 
towards them with guns still in hand. The riot was almost deafening, but their voices were 
heard, &quot;Sailor V?&quot; 

&quot;Dante!&quot; Venus ran towards him. 

He looked at her, now in her orange uniform, slightly confused, &quot;What happened to your 
mask?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s Sailor Venus you moron,&quot; Sirico reminded his partner. 

&quot;Look, there&#39;s no time,&quot; Venus said, &quot;Sollozzo&#39;s the one responsible for Sailor Moon&#39;s 
contract. He works for the Negaverse. We gotta take him down-&quot; 

Just as they were talking, a crazy man with a knife lunged after Sailor Venus. Sirico took 
out his baton and tried to hold off the man. Before Dante could help him, Jupiter gave the 
criminal a hard punch to the face. She ran into the crowd. 

&quot;You guys get Sollozzo,&quot; Jupiter shouted to Venus and the officers, &quot;I&#39;ll help take care of 
the mob!&quot; Sailor Mars followed her. 

The scene became very violent as the battle between pure good and evil commenced. The 
police could only avoid violence so much. No shots were fired, but plenty of leg breaking 
took place as police grabbed hold of the wounded criminals and dragged them into the police 
vans. Jupiter and Mars continued to help the police officers bring down the mob. 

Sailor Moon, Mercury, Venus, and the two sergeants watched as Sollozzo scaled the fire 
escape. 

&quot;Sal!&quot; Dante shouted at him. 

Shots fired from Sollozzo&#39;s gun. The first two were complete misses, and Sailor Moon&#39;s 
Silver Crystal prevented the other shots from doing anything. As Sollozzo went back to 
running up the stairs, Sailor Moon removed her tiara. 

&quot;Moon Tiara,&quot; She shouted as the golden headband glowed with energy, &quot;Magic!&quot; 

She threw the accessory with all her might towards the evil man. As the weapon made it&#39;s 
way towards the criminal, he caught it with his bare hands. Only a few Nega-monsters had 
ever done this. Needless to say, Sailor Moon was very surprised. Sollozzo knew enough about 
Sailor Moon&#39;s tiara not to hold onto it for too long. He threw it hard into the ground 
causing a slight explosion in the ground. Sailor Venus pushed everyone out of the way. Amy 
grabbed a hold of Serena. 

&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Sirico shouted. 

&quot;He&#39;s probably just as strong as any Negaverse monster we&#39;ve ever faced,&quot; Mercury pointed 
out. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sailor Venus said holding her breast, &quot;And I&#39;ve got a busted boob to prove it.&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; Dante said, &quot;We&#39;re gonna need to scale-&quot; Dante did a double take towards Mina still 
holding her breast, &quot;Wait what?&quot; 

Sirico&#39;s eyes opened, &quot;You know,&quot; He said staring at Saior Venus, &quot;I worked as a medic back 
in the army, I could take a look at-&quot; 

&quot;Shut up Sirico!&quot; Dante snorted. 

&quot;Well I&#39;m going up!&quot; Sailor Moon said as she ran onto the fire escape. 

&quot;So am I!&quot; Sailor Venus ran after her. 

Mercury, Dante and Sirico followed, but several men blocked the entrance with their bodies. 
They charged at the three of them. Dante was a top-notch boxer and could take down anyone. 
Seven hard hits to the face, and one of the criminals was down for the count. Mercury 
easily kicked another one of them in the face. Sirico managed to get in a fight with a big 
muscle-guy who pounded on him. The criminal&#39;s fists were taking Sirico down. Dante tried to 
back up his partner, but Mercury simply splashed bubbles into the muscle-man&#39;s eyes. He 
brought his giant hands up to his face and cried as if she had sprayed mace in his eyes. 
Sirico now hit the man hard. It took several punches but the man eventually fell. 

&quot;What the fuck is wrong with you?!&quot; Sirico shouted. &quot;Fighting with a police officer, trying 
to kill a bunch of girls, and for what? Money?&quot; 

&quot;A shitload of money!&quot; The man moaned in-between screams. 

Mercury could only bring her hand to her forehead. 
 
 

While all this was going on, Sailor Moon and Venus ran up the fire-escape trying to catch 
up with Sollozzo. The clicking of the drug-dealers shoes only intensified the girls&#39; 
energy. Even with their heels getting caught in the steps occasionally, they didn&#39;t 
hesitate. That is? until Mina heard the cry of one she loved. 

Raye screamed. Sailor Moon and Venus stopped and peaked over the side of the fourth story 
fire escape to see six guys having piled on-top of Sailor Mars. Mina&#39;s eyes nearly popped 
out of their sockets: 

&quot;Raye!&quot; She jumped clear off the fire escape. Her heels fell to the Earth right on top of a 
couple of the men who jumped her girlfriend. She pulled out her chain and whipped them all 
off of the raven-hair, &quot;Get off of her!&quot; 

Sailor Mars jumped up and angrily ignited all of them on fire. The 1500 degree flame was 
enough to burn the skin off of these men. 

&quot;Mars, no fires!&quot; Venus cried out. Raye regained her composure and realized she couldn&#39;t do 
what she was doing. 

Mercury splashed all the men with water dousing the fire. They all fell to the ground in 
pain, &quot;Mars!&quot; The bluenette screamed. 

Venus held onto Mars&#39; shoulders. &quot;Take it easy Raye,&quot; she said. 

Sailor Mars and Venus looked into each other&#39;s eyes almost like they were meeting again for 
the first time. 

The crowd was starting to dissipate. Some of the criminals were running away as the police 
dragged the unlucky ones into the vans. 

Sailor Moon chased Sollozzo up the staircase. The drug-dealer reached the roof in no time. 
He ran ten feet away from the fire-escape and pointed his gun waiting for Sailor Moon to 
surface. His concentration could not be thwarted by anything. 

As she reached for the roof, Serena hesitated. Her eyes paced back and forth. She took a 
deep breath and closed her eyes. It was almost as if she was channeling Raye, meditating 
for full concentration. Suddenly she pulled out her moonwand and flipped into the air. 
Sollozzo fired several shots as Sailor Moon&#39;s body spun through the air. The shield coming 
from the Silver Crystal blocked the bullets. Serena extended a leg and slammed right into 
Sollozzo&#39;s face. 
 
 

A feeling overtook Sailor Venus she had not felt in years. It was as if her body was 
freezing and burning at the same time; a hammer pounding on her head; gravity pushing her 
to the ground. Instincts took over and the blonde-haired Scout left the fight scene and ran 
up the fire-escape. 

This same feeling was beginning to get to Mercury, but her hands were tied. While she, 
Mars, Jupiter, Dante, Sirico and several cops fought the most determined of all criminals, 
most of the crowd had either run away or was packed in the police vans like sardines. 
Nevertheless, Mercury turned her head to see Venus running up the staircase. Her 
concentration was broken when a big muscle built guy began to choke her. Jupiter jumped 
onto the man wrapping her arm around his throat. The villain unhanded Mercury and tried to 
shake off the Scout of Thunder. 

Venus ran as fast as she could up the staircase. 

Sailor Moon wasn&#39;t even sure if Jupiter could bring this man down. He may have had a 
well-built muscular body, but Sollozzo didn&#39;t look like any nega-monster she had fought 
before. He had no tainted skin, no claws on his hands, not even alien eyes. None of Sailor 
Moon&#39;s martial arts skills could take this man down. While her crystal could block bullets, 
that&#39;s where it stopped. Her source of power could do nothing to weaken this man&#39;s energy. 

Sollozzo found it useless to use his gun, so long as Sailor Moon still had that wand. He 
took care while boxing her. The princess may have looked anorexic, but she could be 
surprisingly strong. 

The two of them stood there in fighting positions staring into eachother&#39;s eyes. They 
intimidated each other, each of them thought they were more scared than the other. The sun 
had now peaked over the buildings in the East. 

&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Sailor Moon asked, &quot;Do you want to know about Beryl, the 
Negamoon, Tomoe? They tried to destroy the Earth! You&#39;re home!&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t think I know that?&quot; Sollozzo snapped, &quot;I couldn&#39;t give a fuck what they did. 
They gave me power, they gave me a reason to live. In this city, you&#39;re either the hunter 
or the hunted. It&#39;s a nasty place Sailor Moon!&quot; 

&quot;Because of you!&quot; Sailor Moon said, &quot;And this isn&#39;t a nasty place. You hear those police 
officers down there fighting-&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t lecture me!&quot; Sollozzo said with his fists flying at her. Sailor Moon ducked. He 
didn&#39;t land a single blow and they two of them stood their ground again. He inched closer 
and closer to her, &quot;You should never have come here!&quot; 

Sollozzo head-butted her so hard that the heroine flew onto her back. Her moon wand flew 
out of her hand and slid along the ground. Sailor Venus had finally made it to the roof 
where the sound of the wand knocking into the wall forced her to look to the ground. 

As Sailor Moon attempted to get herself up, Sollozzo&#39;s gun appeared in her sight. Her eyes 
could clearly see every move. The drug-dealer&#39;s finger quickly pulled on the trigger. A 
bullet blew out of the barrel, flying through the air getting closer and closer. Finally, 
the bullet ripped through Sailor Moon&#39;s leotard and pierced her chest. 

She lied on her back, her white leotard now becoming covered with blood. Sailor Moon had 
simply become numb from the shock of the shot. Pain soon seeped in. Her breathing became 
more and more difficult. She was dying. 

Sailor Venus screamed something completely inaudible as she watched her wounded princess. 
She didn&#39;t have time to focus on her because Sollozzo now pointed his gun towards her. 
Thinking fast, Venus somersaulted onto the ground picking up Sailor Moon&#39;s wand. As another 
bullet raced towards Sailor Venus, a shield escaped the wand just as Venus came down to one 
knee. The bullet stopped. Venus looked over at Sailor Moon who had turned her head to her. 

&quot;Shit!&quot; Sollozzo said as he sped towards her. 

Sailor Venus raced towards him and pulled out her chain. She whipped Sollozzo hard in the 
face. He screamed in pain and held his cheeks in pain. Mina hit him right where his hands 
held his face. Her strength was too much for Sollozzo to bear, so he kicked her right in 
her shin. OUCH! Mina limped away in pain. The drug-dealers face revealed a nasty bleeding 
scar from the chain. His teeth grinded together. His eyes filled with fire. The man charged 
at Sailor Venus who held the Moon Wand hoping it would do something. 

The villain and the heroine wrestled on the ground. The Moon Wand was now knocked away, 
giving Sollozzo a chance to shoot. But Venus was quick. She managed to shoot out a shot of 
her crescent beam to knock the man back slightly. The gun had now flown clear off the roof. 
The beam had barely sapped any of Sollozzo&#39;s strength and he went back to wrestling with 
her on the ground. 

&quot;Fucking cunt!&quot; Sollozzo shouted standing on all fours over her. 

With his scar now bleeding like crazy, he looked like a Nega-monster. Eventually Sollozzo 
got a hold of Sailor Venus&#39; chain and wrapped it around her neck. Mina was able to hold her 
hand in-between the chain and her neck. Still Sollozzo had the power to choke her to death. 
Mina managed to pull the chain slightly away from her neck in order squeeze out what she 
wanted to say: 

&quot;You will never EVER break-up the Sailor Scouts!&quot; 

Sollozzo managed to tighten his grip, &quot;I just killed your princess! It&#39;s over. You don&#39;t 
have the power to destroy me Sailor Venus!&quot; 

GUNSHOT! 

The sound of the gunshot suddenly forced Sollozzo to loosen his grip. Mina could pull the 
chain off of her neck. The man stood over her, his eyes widened as he looked down his 
shirt. Blood engulfed his shirt. Mina backed away from him. Sollozzo managed to turn around 
to see his assassin: 

Dante! Sollozzo looked at his enemy holding the same gun he had used to shoot Sailor Moon. 
Dante stood there with a grave look on his face. But Sollozzo smiled as he fell to his back 
and took his last breaths. 

&quot;Well done Dante!&quot; He whispered. 

Dante said nothing but put his gun down to his side. Sirico appeared next to him. 

&quot;You all take care-&quot; Sollozzo took one last breath and collapsed. 

&quot;SERENA!&quot; A shout came from Sailor Mercury as she ran towards her Princess on her back 
bleeding on the rooftop. Sailor Moon watched as her blue-haired soldier kneeled before her. 
She could see the wound through her leotard. &quot;Oh My God!&quot; Amy began crying as she threw 
both of her gloves off and lifted Sailor Moon&#39;s leotard. The bullet had hit her right the 
chest, maybe even hitting her heart. &quot;No!&quot; Mercury cried, &quot;No, no no!&quot; 

With her bare hands she kept pressure on the wound. Venus immediately ran over to where 
Mercury was looking at her princess. 

&quot;Amy,&quot; Serena whispered in pain. 

&quot;Don&#39;t say anything Serena,&quot; Amy said, &quot;Save your strength, we&#39;re gonna get you out of 
here.&quot; 

&quot;Amy,&quot; she whispered again almost sounding like she was going to die, &quot;I love you!&quot; 

&quot;Do not say that!&quot; Amy cried. She could barely catch her breath. Tears also came down 
Venus&#39; eyes. &quot;Do not say that Serena, you are not going to die! We&#39;re going to get you to a 
hospital!&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Venus said. 

Sailor Mars and Sailor Jupiter appeared from the fire escape to see Amy and Venus kneeling 
before their wounded princess. Dante had just finished checking Sollozzo&#39;s pulse as he 
stood up to see the wounded girl. Sirico was standing overhead shocked. 

&quot;All units,&quot; Sirico&#39;s radio went off, &quot;Area on Church street is secure. I repeat area on 
Church Street is secure.&quot; 

&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Raye screamed as she ran towards Sailor Moon. Jupiter immediately followed. 
They gathered around their princess. 

&quot;This is sergeant Sirico,&quot; the officer spoke into his radio, &quot;Sollozzo is dead, but we have 
an officer down at the top of the building. We need medics now!&quot; 

&quot;Oh my God,&quot; Mars said, &quot;He shot her?&quot; 

&quot;Serena,&quot; Venus ignored her lover as her white gloved hands grabbed a hold of the odango&#39;s 
pale skin. Her eyes lazily looked into Venus, &quot;I want you to listen to me! You are not 
going to go like this! We&#39;re going to get you out of here! We&#39;re gonna get you to a 
hospital, they&#39;re gonna patch up that wound, you&#39;re gonna get all the ice-cream you can 
eat, and we&#39;re going to go home and you&#39;re going to have hot sex with Amy!&quot; 

Serena&#39;s eyes vacillated back and forth. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Amy said trying to crack a smile, &quot;She&#39;s absolutely right!&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; Serena said weakly, &quot;I do like ice-cream.&quot; 

&quot;There you go,&quot; Venus smiled with tears in her eyes. &quot;That&#39;s the Serena I know!&quot; 

Serena suddenly closed her eyes and her face was filled with pain. She moaned loudly. 

&quot;Hold on Sailor Moon!&quot; Raye said. She stood up and yelled to the officers, &quot;Get some 
fucking doctors up here now!&quot; 

&quot;All units, all units,&quot; Sirico tried the radio again, &quot;I repeat we need immediate medical 
attention!&quot; 

&quot;Please Serena,&quot; Amy&#39;s tears could no stop, &quot;I will never leave your side again! I 
promise!&quot; 

&quot;Sollozzo&#39;s gone Serena,&quot; Jupiter said, &quot;There&#39;s no more bounty on your head. Things can go 
back to the way they were!&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sailor Venus said, &quot;We can be the Sailor Scouts again! We can&#39;t be the Sailor 
Scouts without our princess.&quot; 

Sailor Moon took one last breath and collapsed into unconsciousness. 

&quot;SERENA NO!&quot; Amy screamed.
