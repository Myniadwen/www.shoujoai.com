<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 11 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>- Uuuggghh I feel like I&#146;ve been hit by a truck! Man&#133;&#133;why is my 
stomach heavy? Wait I&#146;m not pregnant?! Or&#133;..- Terri&#146;s eyes opened 
frantically and she looked at her stomach. There was a large lump. 
Upon closer inspection she saw that it was her raven-haired friend. 
-Thank God! Menia would have been frantic!- Terri shook the sleeping 
girl awake.

&#147; What? OH! Terri your awake!&#148; Rei hugged Terri&#133;maybe a little too 
tight.

&#147; Rei? If you don&#146;t let up, your gonna fracture something.&#148; The Fire 
Senshi blushed and let go. 

&#147; Sorry but you&#146;ve been out a whole week!&#148; 

&#147; A week? What about UN Productions? How are my workers?&#148;

&#147; Their fine, just on vacation.&#148;

&#147; With pay?&#148;

&#147; No&#133;&#148;

&#147; Rei!&#148;

&#147; Just kidding, every things good. Especially now that your awake.&#148;

&#147; Is Dradian dead?&#148;

&#147; Yup! In one big gory mess! Though you almost died doing it.&#148;

&#147; Well it had to be done. I&#146;m just glad Naraiah&#146;s gone, she really was 
a twit.&#148;

&#147; I&#146;ll go get the others&#133;&#148;

&#147; No, just go look at my door.&#148;

&#147; Ok.&#148; Rei left but came back in five seconds later and jumped on the 
bed. Then took Terri in another tight hug. Everyone came bursting in. 
Wide smiles appearing on their faces. They immediately looked at 
Terri&#146;s door. There in the bottom right corner, among the black was 
the red sign of Mars. Life was REALLY good.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A/N: Well now I definitely want you to review! So Terri didn&#146;t die. 
Rei is my favorite and I wouldn&#146;t want her to be sad would I? Nope, of 
course not! So long Minna! Until the sequel then!
