<pre>Author&#39;s Note

This is just a short piece I did in... uh roughly ninety minutes. Kind 
of an answer to the monthly theme on our SiL list. Short but sweet, I 
hope. I didn&#39;t put much thought into it. Just a spur of the moment 
thing. Enjoy.

******************************

	I opened my eyes and immediately let out a groan, being greeted 
by the standard furniture of what could only be a hospital. My mind 
was still foggy and I tried in vain to remember what had happened that 
could have brought me here of all places. There didn&#39;t seem to be any 
noticeable signs of greater injury. Nothing was hurting in an 
unendurable way... So what had happened?
	&quot;Look who&#39;s awake,&quot; a voice interrupted my mental analysis and 
prevented me from further trying to remember the exact cause of why I 
was where I was. The voice sounded awfully familiar and thus I turned 
my head to the other side, wincing slightly as a sharp pain flared 
through my right arm but that was momentarily forgotten as my eyes 
settled on the younger girl standing next to the bed. &quot;Hi,&quot; Hotaru 
smiled and reached out with one hand to stop my attempt of turning 
completely around. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t strain the arm.&quot;
	&quot;Ugh,&quot; I held my left hand to my face, quietly reasoning that 
the advice FELT reasonable enough. Only a bandage, not a cast... 
&#39;Well, at least something&#39;, I took stock of myself. I turned my head 
so that I could look at the raven-haired girl, noticing with more than 
a bit of admiration that the nurse outfit suited her quite nicely... 
Then again, everything seemed to these days. She had developed into a 
fine young woman over the last two years. Another age acceleration had 
set in slightly after Galaxia and the growth had filled our youngest 
member out in just the right places... &#39;Gah, I must have gotten hit on 
the head too or something...&#39;
	I averted my eyes awkwardly. &quot;Um... What happened? Kind of fuzzy 
up here, you know.&quot;
	I could feel more than see the stern gaze directed at me. I&#39;ve 
gotten a lot from Artemis over the years. I knew how a displeased look 
felt without needing to see it. &quot;You miscalculated your landing 
point.&quot;
	Huh? Miscalculated? Oh... I remembered training. Upon entering 
High School I had taken up volleyball again and had quickly worked 
myself to the top of the team. We had been training this afternoon... 
well, it had been afternoon then and there had a particular hard to 
get ball and I...
	Oh.
	Oh!
	I had tried to reach an impossible attack with a quite... 
hazardous jump. I think I got it too but now that the fog up in my 
head was clearing the last thing I remembered was the wall on one side 
of the field...
	Oops...
	&quot;Err...&quot; I shifted a little under the sensation of displeasure 
directed at me and tried to divert attention. &quot;What are you doing 
here?&quot;
	&quot;I am working here with Ami-san. You KNOW that.&quot; Uh oh, I didn&#39;t 
think that was a good tone. Definitely not. Sounded more like really 
annoyed and... covering nervousness. &#39;Hah?&#39; I dared to look back at 
the younger girl, steeling myself against the expected look and looked 
further, senses developed and sharpened over the years coming into 
play, even managing to slip underneath the usual cold shield Saturn 
veiled her emotions into. I found a confirmation of what I had thought 
to have instinctively picked up.
	&#39;Hmm, interesting.&#39;
	The cross expression didn&#39;t change although I detected a certain 
uneasiness at the sudden stare. &quot;You are lucky enough nothing was 
broken when you crashed into the wall. What were you thinking diving 
over half the field to reach a ball that had already left the field on 
the opposite end IN TRAINING?&quot; I had the good sense to look chagrinned 
but couldn&#39;t help but notice the way Hotaru looked with her hands on 
her hips, trying to do the best impression of an upset, displeased 
family member who just tried to hide her worry.
	&quot;At least I have a cute personal nurse to take care of me,&quot; I 
said with a wink, effectively managing to draw a blush from the other 
girl. The comment was made casually enough so that anyone who did know 
me wouldn&#39;t think about any hidden meanings. The reaction though. The 
slight hesitation, the spark of confusion...
	&#39;Yes, definitely interesting.&#39;
	&quot;I have to be elsewhere too, you know?&quot; Hotaru countered, yet it 
was obvious she didn&#39;t mean it, at least she didn&#39;t want it to.
	&quot;And how long have you been here?&quot; It was a wild guess but if 
what I had sensed was true then... &#39;Ah, another blush! How adorable.&#39; 
Hotaru looked away and mumbled something, drawing a triumphant smile 
from my lips. &quot;If it&#39;s not so serious, you could just heal it,&quot; I 
suggested, not able to keep the hopeful note out of my voice. I hated 
hospitals. They were driving me crazy with boredom. You could do 
nothing but lie around in your bed and maybe read... well, if you 
liked to read... I was an action girl and being confined to rest was 
one of my worst nightmares.
	Hotaru crossed her arms, chin firmly set and eyes cold, baring 
no argument. &quot;Not a chance.&quot;
	&quot;Why?&quot; I asked incredulously. As far as I knew since her rebirth 
healing was taking next to nothing out of her. It would probably just 
be a little bit of a strain, if any at all.
	&quot;Because this is nothing Senshi-related.&quot; I pouted at that but 
the other girl was quick to add, &quot;And besides, you have to learn from 
your own mistakes. Maybe next time you think before trying to pull a 
stunt like that.&quot; The tone of her voice was flat but I could still 
hear the concern leak through.
	&quot;Hey,&quot; I reached out with my good arm, putting a hand on the 
other girl&#39;s, &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; A wince somewhat killed the attempt of 
reassurance. &quot;Well, I will be. You know me. Nothing can hold me down 
long enough.&quot; An inner battle was fought in the space of the next 
moments but the decision was nearly inevitable. I couldn&#39;t deny 
feeling a certain form of attraction to our youngest Senshi - in 
physical age at least. I wasn&#39;t sure how it had developed but somehow 
we had connected throughout and in between school, training and other 
activities. I couldn&#39;t say we had become best of friends but somehow 
we kept bumping into each other, ended up in the same training group, 
as sparring partners...
	Purple eyes settled on me and I met the stormy, 
uncharacteristically unguarded feelings there with a soft gaze. There 
was an attraction there from Hotaru&#39;s end as well, I had always 
believed that to be the case but now, in this situation, I had gotten 
the proof I had looked for. Like many young girls Hotaru had a 
well-rounded star fetish and I had seen her the one or other time in 
some of the musicals I had performed in with the club that I had 
joined upon my second year. And I had only spotted her once or 
twice...
	&quot;You scared the hell out of me when you were brought in, I 
thought...&quot; If it had just been idolization I would probably have 
shrugged it off and not acted on it. Things like that never worked 
out, made the experience myself often enough. Now there was enough 
proof to act on my own impulses. Frankly, this might be one of my only 
chances to find some ounce of personal happiness. I had long resolved 
that the only one I could allow myself to fall in love with was a 
fellow Senshi. Outside relationships had always ended in disaster. 
Trying to divide my attention and devotion between a lover and 
Serenity was impossible. It needed to be someone who understood that. 
Someone who wouldn&#39;t look odd, got jealous of Usagi or something like 
that, someone who could share the burden and who I could rely on to 
protect themselves if the choice ever came up between them and my 
duty...
	&quot;Gomen,&quot; I said at last, meaning it with all the honesty I could 
manage. I had already made up my mind that the stunt was just as 
stupid as unnecessary. &quot;How about a compromise? You take me home and 
take care of me? Then you can be my real personal nurse? I&#39;m sure 
Mizuno-san can spare you for the rest of the day?&quot; I winked. Letting 
Hotaru see the emotions from my end.
	The raven-haired girl let out a tiny gasp but the answer came 
softly, almost frightful of shattering the unexpected deep moment. 
&quot;What kind of compromise is that? Is there something I get out of that 
solution?&quot;
	Tomoe Hotaru didn&#39;t have time to even think about a reaction to 
the mischievous grin spreading over my face. I had expected that reply 
and was prepared for it. With one smooth movement I had pulled her 
forward with one hand, sitting up slightly at the same time. It was 
just a small peck actually, rather playful and teasing. Nothing 
world-moving but warm and... good.
	Promising.
	Purple eyes looked at me dumbfounded but with a new sparkle to 
them. Wondrous, excited, daring to hope. &quot;I&#39;m sure we can think of 
something.&quot;
	A couple of days later I would think back on that and the 
recovery process and realized that I still wasn&#39;t a great fan of 
continuing inactivity, having an apt distraction was very helpful. 
Maybe the entire thing was stupid and unnecessary but with an outcome 
like that I would have done it all over again had I known in advance 
this would happen.
