<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 7 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The song is called &#39;My Baby You&#39; by Marc Anthony. I don&#39;t own the song 
nor SM.

Ami yawned and stretched as she reached over and shut off her alarm. She 
rolled back onto her back and rubbed the sleep from her eyes, last 
nights dream filling her mind.

She sighed, wishing she had been nicer to Makoto from the begining, but 
knew it was too late for that. Ami turned her head and saw large, 
chocolate brown eyes stareing at her.

Ami blinked and jumped from surprise, then calmed down when she saw it 
was only Leo looking at her. He closed his eyes and meowed, his tail 
twitching back and forth. Ami smiled and sat back down on her bed as Leo 
padded over to her and rubbed his head agaisnt her arm. She raised her 
hand and petted the fluff of hair that was on top of his head. Her 
mother was right, he did look like a lion.

Ami stood and stripped out of her pajamas and under clothes, put her 
robe on and headed for the shower. As she began to run her bath water, 
she heard a beeping coming from her room and shut the water off and ran 
to her room. She knew what it was, and she was right.

Ami picked her communicator up and switched it on. &quot;Mercury here. Go, 
Sailor Moon.&quot;

&quot;Senshi, we have a problem...&quot;

The park near the dock of the lake looked like WWIII had just started. 
The dock was blown up, trees were resolved to nothing more than mere 
stumps.

As Mercury reached the battle, she could hear every one else had arrived 
and was fighting. And from the looks of the place, they weren&#39;t fairing 
so well.

Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Kamen were crouched behind a tree that had yet to 
be destroyed, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars were dodging attacks from the 
same man that had attacked Minako&#39;s school, and Yung Hu was holding a 
small, pink haired girl in his arms.

&quot;Whats going on,&quot; Mercury said, running over to Sailor Moon. &quot;And when 
did he get his memory back?&quot;

&quot;Long story about him We survive this, I&#39;ll explain. This fight, 
however...Luna woke me up when she saw a pink light flash here and asked 
me to check it out. I called Mamo-chan to come with me and we found that 
kid Yung Hu is holding fighting for her life agaisnt Rubeus-&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

Tuxedo Kamen pointed up at the red haired man. &quot;Him.&quot;

&quot;..And then I called everyone here. When the girl saw Yung Hu she ran 
right to him and has yet to let him go. Not that I blame her.&quot;

&quot;So whats the plan,&quot; Mercury asked while taking out her computer and 
activating her visor.

Sailor Moon looked at her and sarcastically replied, &quot;Survive?&quot;

Mercury rolled her eyes and looked down next to her when she heard a 
meowing. She saw Leo sitting next to her. &quot;You FOLLOWED me!?&quot;

&quot;New pet,&quot; Moon asked. Mercury nodded.

&quot;Mom got him for me.&quot;

Leo meowed then began to glow a bluish colour. He walked out to where 
the fightng was taken place, looked up at Rubeus, and for such a small 
creature a very loud roar came from him.

His body was shot up into the air as if by magic then his body began to 
stretch and take on another form. The blue light surrounding him flared 
out and when it faded the lion gargoyle with the tiger stripes stood, 
arms crossed over his massive chest and was casting a sideways glance up 
at Rubeus.

The two stared at each other, then the gargoyle smiled and said, &quot;Boo.&quot;

Rubeus blinked the screamed out in pain when two red energy blasts hit 
him from behind. Rubeus quickly faded from that spot and reformed in 
another, behind his attackers. He blinked when he saw two more 
gargoyles, these midnight black crows.

Rubeus sneered as Yung Hu took a spot next to the lion, the girl still 
being held in his talons, his snow white wings wrapped around her for 
more protection.

&quot;So, the princess&#39;s guardians came with her, huh? So be it. You will all 
die!&quot; Rubeus laughed and faded from the battle.

The two gargoyles in the sky flew down to the huge cats and folded their 
wings.

&quot;Princess,&quot; the crow with brown eyes spoke, &quot;You know you shouldn&#39;t have 
come here.&quot;

&quot;I know, but I had to save my mommy,&quot; the little pink haired girl said 
quietly. Yung Hu held her closer.

&quot;Princess,&quot; the lion said, &quot;You should have told us you were leaving. We 
would have helped you.&quot;

&quot;I know, Raiga. But I wanted you to stay in the future to protect people 
there.&quot;

&quot;You know we couldn&#39;t have done that,&quot; the other black bird said. &quot;One, 
there are no people left alive there. And second you are our only 
concern. The Senshi are the ones responsiable for protecting the Earth. 
Not us.&quot;

&quot;Um, excuse us.&quot;

The gargoyles turned to look at the senshi and Tuxedo Kamen who was 
looking at them confused.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Raiga asked.

&quot;We need to go my temple to talk,&quot; Mars said.

&quot;No. We do not follow your orders-&quot; The male bird started but was cut 
off.

&quot;We will go there. We will need their help during this battle, Karasu,&quot; 
Yung Hu said. &quot;They can be trusted with this matter.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure,&quot; the female asked.

The small child in Yung Hu&#39;s arms spoke up. &quot;If Hu-chan says they can be 
trusted, Tori, then they very well can be.&quot; Yung Hu smiled down at her 
and nodded his thanks. She smiled at him.

&quot;Very well. We&#39;ll meet you there,&quot; Raiga said and then flew up, the 
other three gargoyles following him.

&quot;We better go if we don&#39;t want to keep them waiting too long,&quot; Mars 
said.

The senshi, still transformed quickly found their way to Rei&#39;s temple. 
Rei allowed Ami to change into some of her clothes and then they went 
into the fire room, seeing as the gargoyles were no where in sight.

After Ami changed, the girls and Mamoru walked silently to the fire room 
and opened the door and blinked. The gagoyles weren&#39;t there, but the 
small child was. In their places were three young men, and a woman.

&quot;Who are you guys,&quot; Makoto asked, narrowing her eyes.

The young man with dark blue hair and green eyes stood, smiling. &quot;You 
don&#39;t recognize me, Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto blinked. &quot;Your voice...&quot;

The man smiled more. &quot;I am your &#39;pet cat&#39;, Ace. My real name, however, 
is Yung Hu. I am from a colony of protectors that hail from the future 
of Hong Kong, China.&quot; Makoto, as well as everyone else, took in his 
human appearnace. He did look Chinese while the other looked Japanese.

&quot;Yung Hu,&quot; Makoto asked again in disbelief. &quot;Why do you look so familiar 
in this form?&quot;

His smile faltered for a moment, then shook his head. &quot;Now is not the 
time for that matter, Makoto. Perhaps later.&quot;

&quot;Then your story...about you getting your memory back...?&quot; Makoto 
questioned.

&quot;I made alot of it up,&quot; he admitted quickly. &quot;I&#39;ll give you the actual 
full story later. Right now tho, we need introuductions. My companions 
all know who you are, but...&quot; Yung Hu turned to face his friends, who 
were now standing.

The young man with brown hair and tanned skin bowed. His hair was long 
and pulled back into a low pony tail, and his eyes were a dark brown.

&quot;I am Raiga,&quot; he said. &quot;But I believe you know me as Leo, Ami-san.&quot;

&quot;I am Tori,&quot; the young woman said bowing. Her hair was long and black, 
blacker than Mamoru&#39;s hair. Her eyes were as red as the child&#39;s eyes, 
but seemed very cold. &quot;That is my twin brother, Karasu,&quot; she said 
pointing to the last young man. His hair was jet black like his 
sister&#39;s, but his eyes were a light carmel brown.

Karasu bowed to them. &quot;Konnichi wa.&quot;

&quot;And the child,&quot; Yung Hu said, looking at the small girl. &quot;She is the 
reason we are here.&quot;

The girl walked up to the senshi and looked at Usagi. &quot;I am Neo-Princess 
Serenity. I come from 30th centaury Crystal Tokyo.&quot;

&quot;Serenity,&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;The girl nodded. P-chan calls me &#39;Small Lady.&#39; But you may call me 
after my mother.&quot;

&quot;What name is that,&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;Chibi-Usa.&quot;

&quot;Usa,&quot; Mamoru asked. &quot;You mean...?&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Yung Hu said. &quot;Usagi is her mother. And you, Mamoru-kun are her 
father. A thousand years into the future anyway.&quot;

Usagi blinked and fell over, her eyes rolling into the back of her 
head...

Usagi groaned as her eyes opened. &quot;What the..?&quot;

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Where am I,&quot; Usagi asked, rubbing her head.

&quot;My room,&quot; Rei said. &quot;Every one has left. I sent Mamoru home a few 
minutes ago.&quot;

&quot;So I wasn&#39;t dreaming,&quot; Usagi said sitting up.

Rei shook her head. &quot;&#39;Fraid not, Odango. You alright?&quot;

&quot;I have a headache, but I guess I&#39;m ok. My daughter, tho...&quot;

Rei smiled a little. &quot;Ami&#39;s gonna see if she really is or if this is a 
ply from the enemy trying to trick us. But I got no bad vibes from her 
nor the others.&quot;

Usagi looked at Rei. &quot;Think she&#39;s telling the truth then?&quot;

Rei nodded. &quot;I think so.&quot;

&quot;Where is she,&quot; Usagi said, moving to stand from the bed.

&quot;She went home with Yung Hu and Makoto. She didn&#39;t want to be away from 
him. Its obvious she trusts him more than the others.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of them, where are the other three?&quot;

&quot;Raiga went home with Ami-chan. Tori and Karasu are here,&quot; Rei answered.

&quot;Where?&quot;

Rei looked to her window. Sitting there were two large black birds;one 
with red eyes and the other with brown.

&quot;You mean..Your pets,&quot; Usagi asked, blinking.

Rei nodded. &quot;Hai. I had always gotten strong vibes from them, but when I 
consulted the fire about them, nothing showed. I think they had 
something to do with it.&quot; The red eyed bird squaked loudly.

&quot;It&#39;s past midnight, Usagi. I called your mother and told her you were 
spending the night here. So you might as well go back to sleep.&quot;

Usagi nodded and looked up at Rei. &quot;Are you alrght, Rei-chan? You&#39;ve 
seemed..detached lately.&quot;

Rei smiled. &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;So, Mako-chan, what do you think about having a child living under your 
roof?&quot; Minako came out from the bath room, buttoning one of Makoto&#39;s 
large dress shirts.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Makoto said. She sat on her bed, her chin in her hands. 
&quot;I haven&#39;t had much to do with dealing with kids. Last time I dealt with 
kids was when I was at the orphanage.&quot;

Minako looked up at Makoto worried. She could tell Makoto had tears in 
her eyes. She smiled slightly and walked over to the bed and sat down 
next to Makoto.

&quot;What&#39;s on your mind, angel,&quot; Minako asked, wrapping her arms around the 
taller girl.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Makoto lied. Makoto raised her hands and began to massage her 
temples, groaning slightly.

&quot;Another headache, Mako,&quot; Minako asked quietly.

Makoto nodded, her eyes twitching. &quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you should go to the docter about them. They&#39;re getting worse 
aren&#39;t they?&quot;

Again, Makoto nodded.

Minako kissed Makoto&#39;s cheek and stood to turn out the light. &quot;Maybe 
it&#39;s time we went to bed. Do we have a meeting tomorrow?&quot;

Makoto slowly shook her head as she climbed into the bed under the 
covers, slowly lying down. &quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot;

Minako nodded and crawled into bed next to Makoto and curled up next to 
her. Laying her head on Makoto&#39;s shoulder, Minako kissed Makoto&#39;s neck 
softly. &quot;Where are Chibi-Usa and Yung Hu?&quot;

&quot;Spare bed room. Yung Hu is in his tiger form trying ti get Chibi Usa 
asleep.&quot;

Minako nodded, wrapping her arms tightly around Makoto. &quot;We should go to 
sleep too. Goodnight, Mako-chan. I love you.&quot;

&quot;Good night. I love you too.&quot;

In the room down the hall, Chibi Usa was curled up next to Yung Hu, 
clutching his fur in her small hands.

&quot;Sing me a song, Hu-chan?&quot;

His emerald eyes twinkled at her as he smiled. &quot;What do you want me to 
sing?&quot;

&quot;The one you always sing to me when I can&#39;t sleep.&quot; She looked up at 
him, her red eyes pleading with him.

Yung Hu chuckled, his laughing sounding more like a soft growl. 
&quot;Alright, alright. Enough with the look, Hime-chan.&quot;

Chibi Usa smiled and curled up closer to him.

Yung Hu gently nuzzled the child&#39;s head beofre his deep voice began to 
carry a slow tune:

&quot;As I look into your eyes
I see all the reasons why
My life&#39;s worth a thousand skies
You&#39;re the simplest love I&#39;ve know
And the purest one I&#39;ll own
Know you&#39;ll never be alone

&quot;My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And &#39;cause of you
I don&#39;t have to wonder why
Baby you
There&#39;s no more just getting by
You&#39;re the reason I feel so alive

&quot;Though these words I sing are true
They still fail to capture you
As mere words can only do
How do I explain that smile
And how it turns my world around
Keeping my feet on the ground

&quot;My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And &#39;cause of you
I don&#39;t have to wonder why
Baby you
There&#39;s no more just getting by
You&#39;re the reason I feel so alive

&quot;I will soothe you if you fall
I&#39;ll be right there it you call
You&#39;re my greatest love of all

&quot;My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And &#39;cause of you
I don&#39;t have to wonder why
Baby you
There&#39;s no more just getting by
You&#39;re the reason I feel so alive&quot;

Yung Hu smiled as Chibi Usa&#39;s snores filled the room. He gently nuzzled 
her cheek before pressing his nose to her face as if he were trying to 
kiss her.

&quot;Good night, little one.&quot;</pre>
