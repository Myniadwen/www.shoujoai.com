<h1>Rickets and Pocky</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Everyone was involved but her.

Well, no, that was a lie. No, not a lie. It was an exaggeration. Yes, that&#39;s
what it was. An exaggeration. After all, there were two other single Senshi
among them. One of which she wished wasn&#39;t quite so single, one she wished
was instead involved with her.

A few days ago she would&#39;ve said that happening was impossible but a few
days ago she wouldn&#39;t be hanging out in Crown Arcade with her friends,
exposed to the abnormality of Minako and Setsuna as an ultra cutesy couple.
It was true you know, they were cutesy and abnormally so. Not just because
it was odd to see Setsuna as anything other than serious but more because
next to the destined and rather staid... no... boring... uhm... okay, just
destined relationships of Mamoru and Usagi along with Michiru and Haruka,
those two seemed very, very, very odd.

Actually, they were more like odd x 1,000,000,000.

For instance, take what they were doing right now. Battling against each
other fiercely in the latest Sailor V fighting game as they tossed insults
at one another. She never saw any of her friends acting like this. Well, at
least the ones dating each other. Watching the couple now, she sighed and
leaned back to observe the sheer oddity of their interactions.

&quot;Hey! What did I say about pulling on my butt bow? That&#39;s cheating!&quot; Minako
proclaimed, bumping into Setsuna&#39;s hip, causing the taller woman to stumble
slightly despite keeping her eyes ahead.

&quot;You said that&#39;s cheating, yes, but I never said I wouldn&#39;t keep doing it,&quot;
replied Setsuna in smug tones before she pulled on the butt bow yet again,
causing the pixilated Sailor V to fall down.

&quot;Setsuna!&quot; whined Minako, stomping her left foot. &quot;That&#39;s cheating!
Cheating!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just upset you&#39;re losing,&quot; said Setsuna, sounding as calm as ever,
but a small smile tugging on her lips to show that she was indeed enjoying
herself.

&quot;I&#39;m losing because you&#39;re cheating,&quot; Minako grumbled. Her eyes narrowed as
she formed a sly expression and snuggled closer to the other woman, pressing
their bodies together, standing up on her tippy toes to whisper something
into Setsuna&#39;s ear.

The guardian of time paused in the game to face Minako, arching an eyebrow
as a slow smile spread across her features. Then she held her hands up in
the air while Minako formed a huge and ecstatic grin. Whirling around to
face the machine, Minako pushed several buttons rapidly, killing Setsuna&#39;s
character with a frightening efficiency.

Whirling around to face Setsuna again, Minako&#39;s grin was wider yet, if that
was possible, as she gave the other Senshi a quick kiss on the lips. &quot;Come
on,&quot; she purred, falling back down onto her feet and grabbing Setsuna&#39;s
hand, &quot;lets get going. That way you can pull my real life butt bow all you
want.&quot; Not noticing the sweatdrops that everyone except herself and Setsuna
wore, Minako turned to their friends and smiled brightly. &quot;Later guys! We
have business to attend to!&quot;

&quot;Fun business,&quot; Setsuna added in a murmur, her smile almost matching the
blonde&#39;s.

Then with that they were out the door of the Crown Arcade, leaving Ami to
watch with eyes tinged with envy. They were an odd couple, yes, this had
been proven true, but they were what looked to be an extremely happy couple
as well. Why couldn&#39;t she have that?

Gazing over at Makoto who was chatting with Rei about gardening at the
shrine and stopping by someday soon to help out with the chore, Ami sighed.
She thought back to the elaborate story she heard from Minako about how she
and Setsuna got together. How she had looked into the older Senshi&#39;s eyes
and just known, with everything in her, that she was wanted, that she was
loved, and it all had happened in what was a matter of hours.

In just hours her entire life changed and now she had someone who loved her.
Someone she loved in return and life, it was better than she could&#39;ve ever
imagined it to be. All because she had taken the time to truly look and
recognize the truth of what she was seeing.

Ami wondered, with more than a little bitterness, why Makoto didn&#39;t ever
look.

Then she realized she was Mizuno Ami and she didn&#39;t get bitter. She was
docile, sweet, and quiet, she was the voice of reason amongst a sea of
silliness. She was a rock, she was an island, she was reciting song lyrics
to herself...

Shaking her head, Ami scowled and realized that she didn&#39;t have to be
anything she didn&#39;t want to be. That meant she didn&#39;t have to be docile,
sweet, and quiet. She didn&#39;t even have to join the army! No, she could be
outgoing, brash, and loud as she wanted if that was her desire. Hell, she
could even tell Makoto about how she felt if that&#39;s what she really wanted.

What she really wanted? Was she going crazy? Of course that&#39;s what she
wanted. She wanted that more than she wanted to maintain her perfect grade
point average... more than she wanted to become a doctor... more than she
wanted to maybe see her mother more than twice a week.

All in all, that was a hell of a lot of want coming from Ami, just so you
know.

Maybe a little too much want, if you asked her. She wasn&#39;t used to wanting
this much. Ami wasn&#39;t the type of person who really desired things. No, that
didn&#39;t sound right... it was more that she just went with the flow. She let
everything develop naturally, without much thought as to how it should be or
how she wanted it to be, she just let it happen, more or less.

That&#39;s not how it was with Makoto though. Not at all. Ami found herself
wanting her more and more, wanting to be with her, wanting to talk with her,
wanting to touch her, wanting to cover her in whipped cream then lick it all
off before she got some cherries and...

Ehhhhhh, yes, Ami had a lot of wanting.

&quot;Ami-chan? Are you feeling sick?&quot;

Turning to face Usagi, who as always, had the patented expression for cute
concern on her features, Ami turned redder yet. &quot;What?&quot; she asked, sure her
voice was reaching all time highs as she spoke. She probably sounded like a
boy on the brink of puberty at his very worst. If only her brain hadn&#39;t
brought up the always appealing image of Makoto and whipped cream.

&quot;Are you feeling sick?&quot; repeated Usagi, frowning as she moved forward to
press her palm onto Ami&#39;s forehead. &quot;You&#39;re not hot but you&#39;re so red...&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Ami searched her wannabe doctor brain for some sort of medical excuse
for her whipped cream induced coloration. Ah, she had it! &quot;I have rickets.&quot;

There was a visible pause as everyone present blinked and stared at Ami.
Finally, Mamoru, being the brave soul that he was, decided to speak.

&quot;Rickets?&quot; questioned Mamoru with light confusion.

&quot;Rickets,&quot; Ami nodded, for some reason deciding this disease was
appropriate. &quot;That&#39;s what I have.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that a bone disease?&quot; Mamoru continued to question, frowning as he
thought back to one of the random medical classes he took. He could never
decide on a major and drifted from class to class. For this semester his
schedule included: Introduction to Basket Weaving, Advanced Thermodynamics,
Golfing Like A Pro, and Astrophysics. He was particularly looking forward to
basket weaving. Maybe he&#39;d learn how to make some nice baskets to keep all
of his throwing roses in. That would be good. &quot;And one for children?&quot;

&quot;Uhm...&quot; Ami turned redder yet as she tried to recall the details.
Unfortunately the super computer that was her brain had just gotten a virus
and Ami was left in her currently brainless state.

&quot;She can&#39;t answer! The rickets has gotten to her!&quot; Usagi exclaimed, tears in
her eyes, always prepared to overreact to any situation. Especially one that
had to do with things she didn&#39;t really understand. &quot;Poor Ami-chan!&quot;

&quot;Usagi-chan...&quot; began Rei, immediately moving to comfort the girl.

&quot;Usako...&quot; started Mamoru at the same time, moving to comfort her as well.

The two paused in motion and stared at each other like a pair of rabid dogs
fighting over a particularly blonde and tasty bone. While this went on the
rest of the Senshi turned back to Ami and the issue of her rickets. After
all, they were used to the Mamoru/Rei in fighting over Usagi.

&quot;Rickets, eh?&quot; asked Haruka, feeling Canadian for a moment. Once she said
this, she blinked and frowned deeply, muttering to herself, &quot;Why do I
suddenly think my name is Amara?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know,&quot; replied Michiru sweetly before focusing on Ami.
Resting her chin in the palm of her hand, she smiled slowly at Ami then
said, &quot;Now then. You say you have rickets?&quot;

&quot;Rickets,&quot; Ami repeated with a nod, choosing to ignore Ama... ehh, Haruka&#39;s
Canadian status.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; murmured Michiru as she leaned into Haruka and smiled that ever
mysterious smile of hers. &quot;Are you sure it isn&#39;t something else? Something
less traumatizing that has a c-cup?&quot;

&quot;C-cup?&quot; Haruka snorted in disbelief. She had gotten over her brief stint as
a Canadian and was now back to her fully Japanese and ultra sexy self. It
was good to be Haruka. Damn good. &quot;It has to be d-cup at least. Just look at
them! That&#39;s not the work of a wonder bra, Michiru.&quot;

&quot;You would know about that,&quot; said Michiru softly, smirking humorously.

For a response, Haruka grumbled something about Michiru not minding the
wonder bra so much a few nights ago. Observing them, Ami wondered just what
the Outer Senshi were talking about.

That was when Makoto spoke up. &quot;If you&#39;re not feeling well, you shouldn&#39;t be
here, Ami-chan.&quot; As she said this, the tall brunette rose to her feet and
offered her hand to the other girl. &quot;Come on,&quot; a smile graced Makoto&#39;s
features as she spoke, &quot;I&#39;ll walk you home.&quot;

Blushing again, Ami nodded and rose to her feet, vaguely hearing Usagi
shriek about her rickets acting up again before Mamoru and Rei snarled at
one another over the right to comfort her. But just as she started to walk
after Makoto, who was already at the door to the arcade, she was startled by
a sudden fierce smack to her ass.

Whirling around to face her ass smacking enemy, Ami gaped at who she saw.
&quot;Chibiusa?&quot; she asked with a good degree of disbelief. First of all, when
had the pink haired demon spa... err, princess arrived in the arcade? Second
of all, why in the hell did she smack her on the ass of all places? That was
just plain weird.

&quot;Go the distance, Ami-chan!&quot; Chibiusa exclaimed with all her sugary
goodness, giving a thumbs up signal and smiling wide. &quot;If I can get Helios
and Hotaru to agree to share me then there isn&#39;t a way that you can fail!
Fight, fight, fight!&quot;

Then Chibiusa ran off in the direction of Hotaru, leaving Ami bug eyed. What
was it about Moon Princesses attracting multiple partners of both genders?
She was sure that it had to be something genetic. It made her wonder if
Queen Serenity was the ultimate mack mama. If they had to bet on it, she&#39;d
say yes on that one. Then she felt a warm hand clasp her arm and she looked
up into Makoto&#39;s worried features. &quot;You ready to go?&quot; asked Makoto.

Nodding her head, Ami allowed Makoto to lead her out of the arcade and
couldn&#39;t help wondering if this was some sort of really bad dream, things
were so odd.

One...

Two...

Three...

Four...

Five...

Six...

Eight thousand and four...

Umpteen...

Twelve...

No, it wasn&#39;t a dream. Although she was starting to wonder about her
counting skills. Ami knew for a fact that she didn&#39;t have rickets but maybe
she had something else. It wasn&#39;t like her to get this way. All stressed out
and mind drifting weird. Maybe since Minako had suddenly gotten more stable
thanks to Setsuna all of her flaky qualities had been transferred to her.
That could be it.

Ehhh... actually, no, that couldn&#39;t be it. Unless this was a bad science
fiction movie. Which was entirely possible, you know. I mean, Sailor Senshi
aren&#39;t exactly plausible either but hey, she was one, wasn&#39;t she? Hmmm...

&quot;Ami-chan?&quot;

Giving a nervous laugh, Ami turned towards Makoto, who was looking at her
with concern as she frowned. Rubbing the back of her blue head, Ami said
sheepishly, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Something really is wrong,&quot; Makoto murmured, her green eyes darkening.
&quot;You&#39;re not acting like yourself at all...&quot; Tilting her head to one side,
she contemplated the other Senshi and sighed as she gave a small smile. &quot;You
aren&#39;t exactly confident in a loud way but you&#39;re never this jumpy either.&quot;
Makoto looked at Ami for a long while before shaking her head and absently
taking her hand to lead her down the street. &quot;Can you tell me what&#39;s the
matter?&quot;

This was it. This was her chance. This was the moment of truth. This was
where she finally got to tell the reality of her feelings to Makoto.

So closing her eyes as Makoto pulled her steadily along, Ami took a deep
breath, preparing her speech mentally before she blurted out, &quot;I&#39;m in love
with you, Mako-chan!&quot;

Makoto&#39;s walk stopped so abruptly that Ami couldn&#39;t prevent herself from
slamming into the taller girl&#39;s backside. She remained there a moment, her
face pressed into the smooth muscles and soft skin, breathing in the vague
scent of flowers and cookies Makoto carried with her. Then she pulled away,
staring at the ground and waiting for Saturn&#39;s scythe to fall on her.

&quot;Did you just say...&quot; Makoto trailed off, her voice reflecting the frown
that Ami was sure was on her pretty features even as she spoke.

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ami with a nod, &quot;I did.&quot;

Silence ensued for a very long time. Well, it wasn&#39;t really silence since
they were on a public street and there were cars and people passing by,
making more than enough noise on their own but Ami didn&#39;t hear any of that.
All she heard was silence and all she felt was a horrible twisting in her
stomach as she waited for Makoto&#39;s full and final reaction to her
confession.

&quot;Ami-chan,&quot; began Makoto in wondering tones and Ami couldn&#39;t believe she was
feeling warm fingers on her chin, lifting her head up. She felt all the more
shocked on seeing the wry look of fondness that the other girl wore. &quot;I
never realized...&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; said Ami, swallowing the lump in her throat. &quot;I tried not to let
you know. Let anyone know really... I guess I was scared, Mako-chan.&quot;

Blinking at this, Makoto frowned. &quot;Why? I think we all love pocky.&quot;

&quot;Pocky?&quot; Ami squeaked, her eyes going wide. Either she was going insane or
Makoto was going insane because the name Makoto sounded nothing like pocky
and she had said she was in love with Makoto, not pocky. Besides, how in the
hell could anyone be in love with pocky?! It was a candy! You can&#39;t be
infatuated with candy! Well... unless you&#39;re Chibiusa. &quot;But I didn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; said Makoto, smiling widely. She took Ami&#39;s hand again and
continued to lead her along. &quot;We all love snacks every now and again. I
honestly didn&#39;t think that you could survive on sandwiches alone, anyway.
But if you want, I won&#39;t tell the others.&quot;

Pocky? When had she said pocky? Maybe Makoto was blocking her name out and
replacing it with pocky because Ami didn&#39;t say that, she knew she didn&#39;t.
Stopping to review the conversation, Ami made a mental rewind to about a
minute ago. Okay, she was walking after Makoto and she was preparing her big
speech which ended up as a short declaration while admiring the nice
backside in front of her...

There she was, taking a breath, getting ready to say it, and then there she
was, opening her mouth and saying it, and there... wait. What the hell was
to the left of her? Stop. Freeze frame. Go to the left and zoom in. Zoom in!
What the hell?! A guy in a giant pocky suit in front of a new candy store
that just opened up. And what was he shouting?

POCKY! He was shouting about pocky! Aughhh! Curse pocky to hell! Curse it to
the deepest levels of hell! Months, for months now she&#39;d been in love with
Makoto and finally... finally she worked up the courage today to tell her,
okay to blurt it out really, but that didn&#39;t matter because pocky ruined it!

And to make it all the more horrible was the fact that Ami hated pocky.

Really and truly hated it. She herself enjoyed the more chewy candies. They
tended to last longer and they had so many yummy flavors. Ami did enjoy
variety. What would she do now if Makoto as a friendly gesture bought her a
box of the fearsome pocky and expected her to eat it? Ughhh. She would have
to do it, just to see that smile she loved so much.

Damn pocky, damn it to hell.

&quot;Ami-chan? What are you muttering about?&quot; asked Makoto, frowning a bit as
she looked back at her friend. There was something really strange about her
today and Makoto couldn&#39;t figure it out. She knew very well that Ami didn&#39;t
have rickets, whatever that was. I mean, Ami was healthy as a horse and
besides, Makoto was very observant about these things. Well, she was more
observant about all things Ami. So if she wasn&#39;t sick then... &quot;Ami-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ami asked, dropping out of her hatred for pocky haze on hearing
Makoto&#39;s voice sounding more insistent this time.

&quot;Are you having problems with your Mom?&quot; asked Makoto worriedly. She knew
that Ami&#39;s mother wasn&#39;t around too much, something that she often got upset
about or at least depressed over. Of all the Senshi, Makoto could relate to
the pain not having a parent there can cause. It was different for her, of
course, seeing as hers would never come back but still... she understood.
&quot;Is she working late hours again? I know you guys have different schedules.&quot;

&quot;My Mom?&quot; said Ami dimly, repeating Makoto&#39;s words in her head and checking
to make sure that she somehow didn&#39;t implicate she was in love with pocky
AND her mother somehow. Seeing it was all clear, she blinked at Makoto then
said, &quot;Her schedule&#39;s been the same as always. I&#39;m sort of used to not
seeing much of her, actually. We make the best of the time that we have.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; said Makoto stupidly, not knowing what to think. What in the world was
wrong with Ami then? She couldn&#39;t figure it out. Sighing in frustration,
Makoto noted their bus stop was coming up and the bus was heading right for
it. &quot;Our ride&#39;s here,&quot; she said, pulling Ami along at a faster pace, busy
contemplating what could be the matter with the other girl.

The contemplation lasted the entire bus ride, all the way until they got to
the street where Ami lived with her mother, in that huge and entirely fancy
apartment building. Makoto only snapped out of her contemplation when they
entered the building so she could walk as carefully across the marble floor
as she could. Something about how expensive this place was creeped her out.
The concept of just having money was foreign to Makoto. She liked nice and
pretty things, yes, but it wasn&#39;t like because of that she automatically
wanted pricey things as well.

Riding up in the elevator, Makoto stared at the back of Ami&#39;s head, her eyes
narrowing as each floor passed, making a dinging noise as it did. What was
wrong with her? WHAT was it? And most importantly why wouldn&#39;t Ami tell her?
They were friends, right? Up until now Makoto would admit she felt closest
to Ami. There was just something about her... her very nature, a sweetness
to her that made Makoto trust her implicitly but apparently it wasn&#39;t the
same for Ami.

That thought made Makoto mad. Really mad to be honest.

In the moment of that madness... err, that anger to more exact, it hit
Makoto. She finally realized just what Ami couldn&#39;t tell her. The reason she
was acting the way she was. On realizing it, Makoto smiled and smiled long
and hard and maybe even a bit sneakily.

Then she closed the front door to Ami&#39;s apartment with a snap of finality.
Ami turned on hearing the noise, rather startled by it and even more
startled by the strange look on Makoto&#39;s face as the other girl neared her.
She had been busy thinking of ways to entertain Makoto and lost track of
reality. Okay, she had been caught up in yet another whipped cream fantasy
to be perfectly honest. Ami wasn&#39;t sure why but she did have a small
obsession involving the taller Senshi and dessert toppings.

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot; asked Ami quietly, using her turn to frown. &quot;Why do you look
like that?&quot;

&quot;Look like what?&quot; Makoto almost purred, her husky voice going a tone deeper,
making her almost able to compete with Haruka in the throatiness department.
Almost, but not quite. After all, there can only be one Haruka, much to the
dismay of her fanbase. Makoto moved forward in an easy stroll, her
expression confident and a tad mischievious, causing Ami to back away
automatically, unsure what to make of her friend in this situation. &quot;I
finally figured it out, Ami-chan.&quot;

&quot;Figured what out?&quot; Ami squeaked, once again sounding like a prepubescent
boy. As she squeaked, she bumped into the side of the sofa, causing her to
fall back slightly and sit on its arm as she watched Makoto approach, the
smirk widening on her features.

&quot;You&#39;re not sick at all,&quot; said Makoto, her smirk still apparent as she
stopped in front of Ami, standing close, nestled in between her legs and
looking down at the other girl.

&quot;I... well... it&#39;s just...&quot; Ami tried to figure out how to explain it away.
It wasn&#39;t that she had been caught lying. I mean, she knew her lie was a
stupid one that anyone but Usagi could see through. It was more that Makoto
was in her personal space. IN her personal space. So much so that Ami could
once again smell the flowers and cookie dough on her and it made her want to
eat... ehh. Well, okay, we won&#39;t be going there but it gave her more
fantasies, okay? &quot;All right,&quot; she sighed, deciding to just admit it. What
was the worst that could happen? &quot;I&#39;m not sick.&quot;

&quot;I knew it,&quot; said Makoto smugly, pulling back and beaming at her. She wore a
playful expression and tapped Ami on the nose as she continued, &quot;You just
wanted out of that arcade, didn&#39;t you? I bet it gets to be a pain, going
there so much when you&#39;re not as into games as we are. I know you like them,
but you hardly get so obsessed... at least that&#39;s how I see it. You&#39;re a
very balanced person, you know? I like that about you.&quot;

The only response Ami had was to stare blankly at Makoto.

&quot;Well! Since you&#39;re not sick and I have a bunch of homework to finish, I
better get going,&quot; said Makoto with a smile and a wink, turning to head out
the door. But then she paused, turning to look at Ami who stared blankly at
her still. The smile never leaving her, Makoto again stopped in front of
Ami, standing in between her legs and leaning down to leave their faces
inches apart. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not sick, Ami-chan,&quot; she murmured.

Then she kissed her. Not a peck on the cheek and not a light brush of the
lips, but an honest to goodness kiss that lasted, by Ami&#39;s computer like
brain, precisely 57.364 seconds. It was soft and it was sweet and Makoto
tasted like cookie dough and she made Ami think of her naked with whipped
cream and cookie dough and flowers but oh, it was good and just as she
started to open her mouth to deepen the kiss, Makoto pulled away, that smile
on her face.

&quot;Uh uh,&quot; said Makoto, wagging her finger at Ami, &quot;I said I have homework to
do and if we do that I won&#39;t be doing any homework anytime soon.&quot; Chuckling
at herself, Makoto squinted and looked up contemplatively. &quot;Since when did I
start sounding like you, huh?&quot; Shaking her head, she faced Ami who wore a
blissed out expression and released a burst of laughter. &quot;Maybe when you
started to act like me,&quot; she remarked fondly, reaching out to caress Ami&#39;s
cheek who leaned into her touch.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; said Ami softly, feeling her courage begin to rise. They were
in her apartment now, they weren&#39;t on a street, there were no pocky shouters
around, she could say it again and this time really be heard. Plus she had
just gotten a damn good kiss. &quot;I&#39;m in love with you.&quot;

Raising an eyebrow, Makoto smiled slyly and replied, &quot;I already knew that.&quot;
Leaning down again, her hands resting gently on Ami&#39;s hips to press their
bodies together, Makoto whispered in her ear, voice low and teasing as she
said, &quot;And just so you know, I love you too. Even if you have rickets.&quot;

When Ami&#39;s mother returned at her usual late night hour from her shift at
the hospital, she was surprised to find her daughter fast asleep in the
living room along with Makoto. Around them was a clutter of books and piles
of homework and the TV flickered with some movie on cable they&#39;d been
watching. Turning it off, she studied the scene in front of her curiously.

There was her baby, her only daughter, her Ami, wrapped soundly in the arms
of Makoto. Her face buried in the other girl&#39;s more than abundant cleavage,
her slim frame rising and falling with Makoto&#39;s every breath and looking,
quite frankly, like she&#39;d won the lottery. But what surprised her mother
most, what really surprised her, in all honesty, was what they had lying on the
coffee table.

Picking it up, Ami&#39;s mother studied it with a frown and said, &quot;She hates
pocky.&quot; Directing her eyes over to Makoto who murmured something and shifted
in her sleep, causing Ami to move closer yet, she smirked then pulled out a
stick of pocky to bite into. &quot;But I guess her girlfriend doesn&#39;t.&quot;
