Denial

Their lips met. Soft, tender flesh. Warm breath and a slight wetness. Ami 
was stunned. Makoto was kissing her. She stood there, wide eyed and 
confused. Once she realized what she was doing she put her hand against 
Makoto&#39;s chest and pushed. She didn&#39;t mean to do it hard, but she nearly 
leveled Makoto against the wall. She took a few steps backwards and 
stumbled into the small couch in the living room. She fell backwards and 
landed half way on the couch, causing her to roll off onto the floor. She 
stood quickly and looked back at Makoto.

Makoto&#39;s lips parted slightly, she wanted to speak but no words came. Ami 
backed to up until she hit the wall and began edging toward the door.

&quot;Ami...&quot; Makoto&#39;s voice was so soft that it took Ami a moment to assure 
herself that she&#39;d heard it.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ami croaked. Her voice broke and wavered all over one syllable, the 
resulting sound would have amused her if it had come at any other time.

&quot;Don&#39;t...&quot; Makoto let the word fall from her mouth limply. It hit the floor 
like a dead trout and lay in the room between them.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to go.&quot; Said Ami softly as her hand reached for the door.

&quot;Ami, please don&#39;t.&quot; The words reached into Ami&#39;s chest and threatened to 
tear her heart out if she didn&#39;t respond correctly. Ami tried to be strong. 
She really did. She let the door close softly behind her and she ran down 
the stairs and out into the street while trying desperately to shut out the 
sound of Makoto&#39;s breath hitching in her throat and the image of Makoto 
sinking to the ground in sorrow.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Ami

&quot;Coward.&quot; The word would not leave her alone. She ran through the streets 
as fast as she could but it would not stop chasing her.

&quot;Coward. Running away from her.&quot; The words pursued her as she reached her 
room and found herself in her bed.

&quot;You ran away from her.&quot; Said the voice in her head.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t stay.&quot; She answered back.

&quot;So you ran away like a child.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a child.&quot;

&quot;You were afraid so you ran. You are just a cowardly little girl.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a cowardly little girl.&quot;

&quot;Has fighting all those monsters made you think your brave?&quot;

&quot;I know I&#39;m brave.&quot;

&quot;Not only a coward but a liar.&quot;

&quot;I am brave.&quot;

&quot;Then why did you run?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know what to do.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re stupid then.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not stupid.&quot;

&quot;Nothing worse than a cowardly idiot.&quot;

&quot;Shut up! I&#39;m not a cowardly idiot.&quot;

&quot;You ran away. You didn&#39;t know what to do so you ran. You ran because you 
were afraid of what you didn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t run.&quot;

&quot;Yes you did.&quot;

&quot;I just needed to get away so I could understand it.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s to understand?&quot;

&quot;Why did she do that?&quot;

&quot;She told you why.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;She loves you.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;You said you loved her too.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that!&quot;

&quot;She did.&quot;

&quot;It was a misunderstanding.&quot;

&quot;You hurt her.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to.&quot;

&quot;She opened her life to you.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to.&quot;

&quot;She risked herself because she thought you loved her.&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot;

&quot;You hurt her, how can you say that?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it!&quot;

&quot;Weren&#39;t you thinking?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;You saw how she looked, she begged you to stay.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;You ran away when she needed you most.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Bitch.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Why are you apologizing to me?&quot;

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Makoto

Makoto watched the door close. When she heard the &#39;click&#39; of the latch 
catching on the door she collapsed. All the strength that held her up fled 
and she hit the ground with a heavy &#39;thud&#39;. She lay on the floor for 
several minutes. Suddenly she was on her feet again. She&#39;d lifted herself 
up with swift, deliberate motions.

&quot;Dishes.&quot; She mumbled as she walked swiftly into the kitchen. There were a 
few plates in the sink from the breakfast she&#39;d made that morning. She 
turned the sink water on full blast, ignoring the fact that the sinks 
stopper was in and washed the plates. Her hands moved over the smooth 
plates swiftly and mechanically. She dried the first and put it on the 
counter. The second dish slipped out of her hand and shattered on the 
linoleum floor. She felt a stinging sensation on her ankle and looked down 
to see that one of the plate shards had given her an inch long cut on the 
top of her left ankle. She left the shards of plate on the ground and 
walked into the bathroom without giving a thought to the pain she felt 
whenever she stepped down on her left foot.

In the bathroom she put her foot up on the sink and placed a small square of 
gauze on her ankle. She used some medical tape to hold it to her ankle and 
put her foot back on the ground. She twisted her ankle around a bit to make 
sure the bandage would stay in place. She walked out into the hall and 
heard the sound of water splashing in the kitchen.

&quot;The sink...&quot; She said as she went back into the kitchen where the sink was 
overflowing and spilling water all over the floor. The water was spreading 
out across the floor and Makoto moved to turn the faucet off. Her right 
foot came down on a few bits of the broken plate that hadn&#39;t been picked up 
and the shards cut into the underside of her bare foot. Her foot jerked up, 
throwing her off balance and forcing her weight painfully onto her left 
ankle. Her right foot went back and she tried to balance on the heel of her 
foot. She stayed aloft for an instant before the slickness under her heel 
caused her foot to shoot forward. She pitched backward and the back of her 
head connected sharply with the wall leaving a large dent in the otherwise 
flat surface. She slumped to the floor unconscious, the only sound in her 
apartment being the steady flow of water out of the faucet and draining onto 
the floor.
