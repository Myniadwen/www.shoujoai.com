<h1>Kazeko (part 13 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Ailan was awake when Setsuna returned after sending Hotaru back to bed.  
She was sitting calmly in the center of Setsuna&#39;s bed, dark red and 
silver sheets pooled in her lap and in a circle around her, her nudity 
not bothering the former Queen of the Moon at all.  She held the Time 
Key that Setsuna had dropped when Haruka screamed.
 
&quot;I returned their memories,&quot; the green-haired woman whispered, closing 
the door and leaning against it, hands clasped in front of her and head 
hung.  She was acting like a child expecting punishment, an attitude 
only her lover could elicit.  &quot;All of them.&quot;
 
&quot;Why?&quot;
 
&quot;I had to,&quot; Setsuna whispered, clenching her fists.  Why did she always 
feel like she had to defend herself against this woman?  &quot;Haruka and 
Michiru tried to combine their powers again.  They had no idea what they 
were doing, but they tried here as they tried before.  I had to stop 
them, but I knew just talking to them would never work.  They&#39;re so 
stubborn, they would never listen to me.  They wouldn&#39;t believe me.  I 
had to show them why I could not allow their powers to merge, and if I 
did not return the Inners&#39; memories, they might end up trying the same 
damn thing.  They&#39;re powerful enough, if they really tried.  It should 
stop them.&quot;
 
&quot;But?&quot;
 
&quot;I hadn&#39;t planned on this happening.  I hadn&#39;t planned on releasing 
their memories.  I think that if you had not come back to remind me of 
who I used to be, I would not have even gone this far.&quot;
 
&quot;Was releasing their memories a bad thing?  Didn&#39;t you want them to 
remember the love they shared?  I remember that they were happy back 
then, dodging their fathers to find time together.&quot;
 
&quot;I want them to be happy, Ailan, but will they appreciate remembering 
their deaths?  I was there, Ailan, I saw that horror.  I have perfect 
memory, so I cannot escape that pain, but they did.  I was hoping they 
would never have to go back.&quot;
 
&quot;I think they will appreciate remembering their lives, my love.  They 
lived good, happy lives as princesses of the Solar System.  It hasn&#39;t 
hurt Usagi to remember her life and death in the Silver Millennium, and 
I am not dying from the pain of the end.  Even you, who seem to carry 
mostly sorrow from your long life, remember the Silver Millennium 
fondly.  Setsu-chan, most of the Silver Millennium was a wonderful time 
of peace; only the end was tragic.  I know it was hard for you to let 
them remember, but I&#39;m proud of you.  No matter what happens now, 
Setsu-chan, you did a good thing.&quot;
 
Setsuna raised her head, that slow, shy smile that Ailan knew so well 
spreading across her face.  She slipped out of her robe and slid into 
bed beside her lover, eyes sparkling with tears.  The smaller woman 
pulled the green-haired senshi into her arms as the Time Key vanished, 
leaving the pair alone.  Setsuna leaned up to kiss Ailan, nuzzling her 
neck gently.  &quot;I love you, Ailan.&quot;
 
&quot;I love you, too, Setsuna,&quot; she replied as the two women stretched out 
under the blankets, Setsuna pillowing her head on Ailan&#39;s breast.  The 
silver haired woman was the only one who could ever make her feel safe, 
the only person who could make her relax, drop her guard.  Ailan 
breathed once more before she let sleep claim her, and Pluto smiled at 
the woman in her arms.  This was how life was supposed to be, sleeping 
with the woman she loved, threats and all other danger pushed away.  If 
she could live forever in this one moment, just before falling asleep 
with Ailan in her arms, she would give anything to do so.  That&#39;s all 
she had ever really wanted.
 
Setsuna smiled as she closed her eyes.  Every ending brought a new 
beginning, and Ailan was hers, at least for now.  She was content for 
the first time in uncounted centuries.</pre>
