<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 22 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>&quot;This is a waste of our time&quot; Manticore scowled, red hair falling over 
rose tinted skin. The leader of the Doom sisters turned from where they 
had been watching the Senshi gathering at the shrine, her sisters 
arrayed around her in the shadows of the great trees. It was peaceful 
here, in the middle of the city, a oasis of green in a busy world.

Sitting on one of the larger branches Chimera smiled coldly as she 
reminded them&quot;We aren&#39;t the ones to decide that.&quot; The blue haired second 
in command frowned&quot;Though I do not understand what these beings are 
doing.&quot;

&quot;They are humans&quot; Hydra noted, her light green skin reminding one of the 
forests of ancient times&quot;irrationality is part of their very nature.&quot;

Gryphon had a worried look on her face, the earthy brown of her skin and 
hair helping her to blend into the trees all around them. &quot;I still 
cannot believe that bitch Setsuna has dared to contacted them directly&quot; 
she said.

Basilisk nodded grimly, the orange skinned figure crouching down nearby 
like some beast ready to lunge. &quot;We might be able to use it for our 
advantage&quot; she noted&quot;if Setsuna hasn&#39;t told them the truth of their 
origins.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple&quot; Manticore reminded them&quot;they would slay us 
on sight&quot;

Hydra nodded glumly as she added&quot;And that damn miko would see through 
any disguise we dared attempt.&quot;

&quot;The Queen will be most annoyed if we don&#39;t find out what they&#39;re 
talking about in there&quot; Chimera reminded them.

Manticore looked over at Basilisk&quot;Can you...&quot;

Basilisk narrowed her cat-slit eyes, frowning as the eerily beautiful 
woman thought. &quot;I can try to spy on them magically&quot; she admitted&quot;but 
Setsuna is a seer. I can&#39;t guarantee that she won&#39;t sense me, her or 
that thrice-damned miko.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get you a basin of water&quot; Gryphon said as she disappeared into the 
trees, her movement almost like that of a ghost. In a few moments she 
returned to the base of the tree they perched in carrying a rough stone 
basin, half filled with rain water.

&quot;A birdbath&quot; Hydra looked amused.

&quot;It holds water&quot; Gryphon said defensively.

&quot;Never mind&quot; Basilisk swiftly cut off the possible argument&quot;it will 
serve well enough for my purposes.&quot; She held her hands out over the 
water, the long razor sharp nails gleaming in the sunlight as she spoke 
softly under her breath, words that were not meant for a human mouth.

The water sloshing in the basin had been mostly clear to begin with, 
glittering, but as the chanting continued on it slowly darkened. 
Changing first pink to blood red it shifted, thickening up to match what 
it so closely resembled. Bubbling slightly images formed in the clear 
center of the fluid, the outline of a room forming.

&quot;There...&quot; Manticore leaned forward eagerly as the women inside began to 
speak.

Inside the shrine Rei frowned as Usagi and Minako lead the tall, black 
haired woman into the room, studying her intently. There was an almost 
unearthly quality to her, an almost ancient wisdom and sorrow that she 
carried with her like a cape.

&quot;Everyone, I&#39;d like you to meet Setsuna Meiou&quot; Minako said formally&quot;from 
what Artemis and Luna say, she may have some of the answers we need.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna-san&quot; Ami Mizuno rose from her seat to bow slightly, her short 
blue hair making her look remarkably boyish.

&quot;Professor Mizuno, it&#39;s an honor&quot; Setsuna returned the bow. She looked 
around with a smile&quot;Makoto Kino, Rei Hino, it&#39;s been a long time since 
I&#39;ve seen you all.&quot;

Usagi had the oddest look on her face as the slim blonde listened to 
Setsuna&quot;You mean that you&#39;ve met all of us in the past&quot;

&quot;I am a seer&quot; Setsuna said to them gently&quot;but I needed to be sure of 
what I saw, so yes, I visited you all as children.&quot;

The door to the room slid open and Rei&#39;s grandfather entered carrying a 
tray. The bald headed priest stepped into the room only to stop, eyes 
widening, as he saw Setsuna standing there. &quot;I hadn&#39;t expected to see 
you again&quot; he said coldly.

&quot;It has been a long time, honored monk&quot; Setsuna bowed to him slightly&quot;I 
bear no ill will from our last meeting.&quot;

&quot;You bear me no ill will&quot; he started to say before Grandfather realized 
all the women&#39;s eyes were resting on him.

&quot;You&#39;ve been busy&quot; Makoto commented wryly, the amazonian young woman 
sitting by the low table. Her usual brown ponytail seemed to almost 
shine today as she leaned forward a bit to study the other woman.

&quot;A misunderstanding&quot; Setsuna answered her quickly&quot;one best not spoken of 
now.&quot;

&quot;Oh no&quot; Rei said firmly, the black haired miko&#39;s eyes flashing as she 
continued&quot;I want to hear about this, please.&quot;

Grandfather smiled grimly as he revealed&quot;When I was much younger I did 
things like you do now.&quot; A breath&quot;I was cleaning out a next of minor 
youma when I encountered the lady here trying to steal artifacts from 
their nest.&quot;

&quot;Not steal&quot; Setsuna quickly corrected&quot;I was retrieving a knife, an relic 
of great power and one that had been taken from me many years ago.&quot;

&quot;Either way&quot; Grandfather continued&quot;we fought in the tunnels for the 
relic and over the lives of the surviving youma, and she escaped.&quot; He 
nodded to them all while tossing a suspicious glance at Setsuna&quot;Good 
luck to you all.&quot;

&quot;You were trying to save youma&quot; Usagi asked in surprise once he was 
gone.

Setsuna met her eyes gravely&quot;It was necessary, as are many of my 
actions.&quot; She looked around the circle of women&quot;I believe you have 
questions&quot;

There was a long moment of silence as the girl&#39;s thought, then Makoto 
cleared her throat. &quot;I&#39;ve always known I&#39;m stronger than normal&quot; she 
said&quot;but where does it come from&quot;

&quot;I was expecting this question, but it still won&#39;t be easy to answer&quot; 
Setsuna said. She took a breath&quot;Your strength, Rei&#39;s visions, the 
intelligence Ami has, even M inalo&#39;s unearthly charisma all come from a 
common source.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re all carrying Oni blood&quot; Minako said calmly&quot;just like you.&quot;

&quot;Not quite&quot; Setsuna sighed&quot;but close. In truth you are all descended 
from the race that preceded both the Oni and youma.&quot;

&quot;I think I may be ill&quot; Rei finally said into the long silence.

&quot;It makes sense&quot; Ami conceded after a moment&#39;s thought&quot;normal humans 
don&#39;t seem to have the sort of abilities we have.&quot; She frowned&quot;But my 
intelligence being from pre-oni descent does seem a bit much.&quot;

&quot;I was surprised you realized it so quickly&quot; Setsuna looked over at 
Minako curiously.

&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about it for awhile&quot; Minako admitted, the blonde 
idol smiling grimly. &quot;How easy it was for me to use their gate under the 
city&quot; she said&quot;how easily I blend into shadows. It was the only answer 
that fit.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I should feel better about all this or disturbed&quot; Usagi 
finally admitted.

&quot;Explains why we heal up so fast&quot; Makoto growled. She closed her eyes&quot;So 
we&#39;ve been killing our relatives all this time&quot;

&quot;What the oni and youma are now have fallen so far&quot; Setsuna said 
grimly&quot;there&#39;s no comparison, none at all.&quot;

&quot;This is a lot to digest&quot; Rei murmured.

&quot;I know, and I wish I could give you time to do so&quot; Setsuna answered&quot;but 
we have bigger problems to worry about.&quot;

&quot;Oh&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;You have defeated all the youma that have been sent out so far, but 
they were merely energy gatherers, just lesser servants&quot; Setsuna grimly 
revealed&quot;the Queen has decided to send her warriors out after you, now.&quot;</pre>
