<h1>Memories (part 2 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/coconut.html">The Coconut Cyclone</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/memories2-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Note: I was going to leave this at a one shot, and chalk it up to peep 
induced madness, but strangely enough people seemed to like this 
twisted little tale. So never being one to intentionally disappoint 
here is a second part to Memories, I hope you enjoy it.

------------------------------------------------------------

I lean against one of the ballroom&#146;s massive marble pillars and sigh. 
The ball has already been going on for two hours and shows no signs of 
winding down. The others always seem to enjoy themselves but I just 
can&#146;t get into the spirit. These things are always so boring for me. 
I&#146;d rather be training than standing here doing nothing.

Well, this one hadn&#146;t been so bad when Uranus and Neptune were here. 
They kept me company for a while, but they mysteriously disappeared 
about a half an hour ago. Oh how I envy them sometimes. They&#146;ve found 
something in each other that others seldom ever find, and unlike 
myself they actually get to see their beloved from time to time. 

Another sigh escapes my lips as I think of you standing there alone at 
the gate. Surely the Queen could allow you to leave the gate more 
often. Seeing you once every few months is killing me. 

A hand on my shoulder pulls me from my thoughts. &quot;Aren&#146;t you going to 
dance?&quot; I can&#146;t help but smile as I turn to face you. You look 
stunning in a dress the color of midnight it self.

&quot;My dance partner wouldn&#146;t like it if I went off with another.&quot; I 
reply falling into an old game. 

&quot;Surely he wouldn&#146;t deny you one dance.&quot; You say moving towards me.

&quot;She, actually and how do you know what she would and would not mind?&quot; 
I reply and close the distance between us.

You smile and wrap you arms around my neck. &quot;I have my ways.&quot; Our lips 
meet and I am in heaven.

***

The scene changes. However, we&#146;re still in the ballroom. It&#146;s emptied 
now, the servants having long gone to bed to prepare for the 
ceremonies tomorrow. I should be in bed myself. I have to get up 
before earthrise tomorrow to meet Mars to meditate. The queen believes 
I need to learn to manage my temper, so Mars kindly offered to help. I 
remember you laughed when I told you a few weeks ago about this anger 
management training, tonight, however you seem worried.

I&#146;d ask you what was wrong but your face tells me without your even 
having to say a word. You saw something at the gate, something that 
worried you, that&#146;s why you paid me this surprise visit. You&#146;re 
unusually quiet even for you, and I know that whatever you saw must be 
very bad. 

We walk out on to the veranda and you still do not speak. For a while 
we merely gaze out onto the gardens in silence. Out of the corner of 
my eye I see your shoulders begin to shake. Tears? My stoic Pluto 
crying, then this is serious. 

&quot;Their now.&quot; I whisper as I take you into my arms. &quot;I don&#146;t know what 
you saw at the gate, but whatever it is I&#146;ll take care of it. You 
needn&#146;t worry. I&#146;m the senshi of strength am I not? I can handle 
whatever challenges that are to come.&quot; The words sound hollow even to 
me, but you stop crying nonetheless.

You give me a small smile. You whisper several &quot;I love yous&quot; into my 
shoulder, as I run my fingers through your hair. &quot;Come on lets go to 
bed. I have an early morning tomorrow and you&#146;ll have to go back to 
the gate soon.&quot; You nod and reluctantly slip out of our embrace.

You turn towards the door and pause. Suddenly you turn back towards 
me. Before I can saw a word your lips are on mine. 

***

My eyes snap open. Another dream&#133;or memory, I can hardly tell the 
difference anymore. Every night they come, and with each night I learn 
more. 

We were lovers then weren&#146;t we? That explains a lot. Especially some 
of the comments Haruka has made about my personal life lately.

But why have you not said anything? Is it that you are ashamed of the 
past, ashamed of me? I have to admit, when I first began to have the 
dreams, the things I saw startled me, but now I accept the past. I 
accept us, so why don&#146;t you?

I know you remember everything, so your silence confuses me. I&#146;ve seen 
the envy in your eyes as you watch Haruka and Michiru. I know that 
you&#146;re lonely. I&#146;d think that you&#146;d want me to remember our past. I&#146;d 
think that you&#146;d want us to be together again. I know I&#146;m not exactly 
the same person that I was then, but I could be what you need me to be 
if you gave me a chance. 

When I think about things, about us together, it feels right. I&#146;ve 
looked up to you for years now. We&#146;ve fought side by side, and I think 
that some small part of me has loved you this entire time. 

We are going to have to talk about this soon. Things can&#146;t go on this 
way. I don&#146;t want to live in memory, or with these doubts. I need 
answers. I need you&#133;
