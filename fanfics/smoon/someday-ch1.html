<h1>Someday, Hold Me Close to You (part 1 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/venusreiko.html">Venus Reiko</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Usagi, Ami, Makoto, and Minako sat around the table in their 
&quot;specialized&quot; chairs, located in their old room in Crown Karaoke. It&#39;d 
stayed clean over the years only because Makoto broke the news to Motoki 
it&#39;d been there the whole time, but he hadn&#39;t noticed. He was baffled 
for the most part, but he diligently made sure to keep the room clean, 
even though he technically didn&#39;t work at Crown anymore. He and Mamoru 
owned it together, but they&#39;d long since hired a few employees to work 
there. Motoki had to make sure his wife, Makoto, had enough help at her 
own shop, only a few blocks away from Crown.

Minako remembered the few times she&#39;d been there. For the most part, she 
was having screaming matches with Rei, disagreements with Rei, and of 
course, the going away party Rei herself arranged for Minako. Even 
though she hadn&#39;t really ever officially jumped into friendships with 
the senshi, she felt at home in that room. As if her being an idol 
didn&#39;t matter-well, except when it came to Usagi. Sometimes, Usagi would 
suddenly realize who she was sitting next to (usually happened every 10 
minutes or so), and then scream, &quot;MINAKO-CHAN!&quot;

But as much as she wanted to deny it, it felt incredibly empty in that 
room as well. Perhaps the others didn&#39;t feel it as intensely as she did. 
But staring at the red chair, which had no occupant, she sure did.

&quot;Mars,&quot; Minako muttered, catching the attention of her fellow and former 
senshi. Usagi, with her huge curious eyes, was the first to speak.

&quot;Minako-chan?&quot;

Minako snapped out of her thoughts and looked over at the odango-clad 
girl.

&quot;Hai?&quot; she replied simply. Makoto and Ami exchanged looks.

&quot;You said &#39;Mars&#39;,&quot; Ami spoke up, her voice characteristically soft. 
Minako gulped nervously, but kept her cool composure.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Had she really been thinking out loud?

&quot;I was just wondering,&quot; she began, letting her eyes wander down to a 
photograph, &quot;where did this picture of she and I come from?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that one?&quot; Usagi grinned and stood up, clasping her hands behind 
her back. She began pacing around the table, a dreamy look in her eyes.

&quot;Manager-san gave it to Rei-chan after the game show. At first she 
refused to accept it, but after much convincing from he and I, she 
gladly took it! Well, sort of... You remember that day, right 
Minako-chan?&quot;

Minako smiled fondly.

&quot;Mm.&quot;

&quot;To be honest,&quot; she thought to herself, &quot;I think about the day all the 
time. It was probably one of the best-no, THE best day of my life... Or 
rather the life before my illness got the best of me. It was the first 
time I had real...friends.&quot;

&quot;A best friend.&quot; Her conscience added.

She could see the day as clear as if she were looking through glasses. 
The image of Rei&#39;s rare, full grin flashed in front of her eyes. She&#39;d 
never again found a feeling like that. That feeling of making Rei happy, 
and it seeming like she&#39;d taken all the pain away from those dark, 
mysterious brown eyes. The way Rei, in turn, wiped away every doubt, 
every sense of loneliness away from Minako&#39;s chocolate brown ones.

&quot;He gave her two pictures,&quot; Usagi&#39;s voice broke through and brought 
Minako back to reality. She turned her eyes back to Usagi.

&quot;She donated one to the photo book here&quot; Usagi pointed to the book. &quot;And 
kept the other one for herself.&quot; She suddenly seemed confused. &quot;He 
didn&#39;t give you one, Minako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Honestly,&quot; Makoto&#39;s voice chimed in. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen Rei look so happy 
in a picture. In all of our group photos, we had to tickle her or get 
Usagi to pull on her cheeks just to get her to smile. You can imagine 
the look we got for that one.&quot;

They all let out a small chuckle. Makoto sighed.

&quot;She&#39;s disappeared to Kyoto once again. Constantly busying herself with 
shrine duties.&quot;

&quot;In the last letter I received from her, she said she was searching for 
sponsorship,&quot; Ami said. &quot;She&#39;s gone to Kyoto to ask the head priest 
there if he&#39;d be able to do the job, or at least recommend willing and 
able donators.&quot;

&quot;And we all know,&quot; Makoto said, leaning back into her chair. &quot;Coming 
from Rei, who never asks for anything, most of all help, this must mean 
a lot.&quot;

Minako&#39;s eyes wandered down to the photo of she and Rei. An idea sprang 
to her mind.

&quot;What if I sponsored her?&quot;

Within a millisecond, all eyes were on her. Makoto sat forward in her 
chair, an unsure look on her face.

&quot;Minako-chan...&quot; Ami squeaked. Minako watched as the girls&#39; eyes 
wandered to the photo book.

&quot;Rei-chan wouldn&#39;t really be...&quot; Ami trailed off.

&quot;For that,&quot; Makoto finished.

&quot;She&#39;s a very proud person. And if you ever offered that to her, she&#39;d 
probably give you the worst glare you&#39;ve ever gotten and then stomp 
off.&quot;

Minako raised an eyebrow at her.

&quot;She&#39;s too proud to accept my help, but she&#39;ll run all the way to Kyoto 
to beg some priest for money? That doesn&#39;t make sense, Ami-chan.&quot;

&quot;What Ami is trying to say is that Rei would rather drop dead and then 
burn in Hell before taking anything from you.&quot;

Makoto hadn&#39;t meant for that to come out so cold, but it was the truth. 
And the truth hurt. Minako herself knew that better than anyone.

The room was silent for a few moments before anyone said anything.

&quot;I think,&quot; Usagi said, a smile spreading over her lips. &quot;You&#39;re someone 
very special to Rei-chan. But she&#39;s not exactly sure how to act about 
it. She&#39;s constantly living in fear she&#39;ll find someone who she cares 
for and opens up to, just to have them leave. She trusts Mako-chan, 
Ami-chan, and myself, but we don&#39;t compare to you. She has so much care, 
trust, and-&quot; Usagi paused. She raised her eyebrows and brought a finger 
to her lips. The other girls were practically falling off the edge of 
their seats, surprised by this new and wise Usagi. But then Usagi 
shrugged.

&quot;Umm... I dunno! But you get the point!&quot;

Ami shook her head while Makoto sighed.

&quot;And here I thought she&#39;d grown some brain cells.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Usagi pouted. &quot;That&#39;s a very Rei-thing to say! Mako-chan, I 
thought you were nice!&quot;

Makoto and Ami burst out into laughter while Minako just smiled. She 
never thought she&#39;d be dwelling on something Usagi of all people said. 
Did Rei really think of her in that sort of way? Did Rei really trust 
her...that much?

&quot;Minako-chan!&quot; Usagi shouted through the stage microphone. Minako looked 
over at her.

&quot;Would you mind doing some karaoke with your number 1 fan? No matter 
what Naru-chan says, I&#39;ve been your number 1 fan longer! Eleven years! 
ELEVEN YEARS!&quot; Usagi hopped up and down for emphasis.

Ami and Makoto giggled and sat back, ready to enjoy the show they were 
sure Minako wouldn&#39;t refuse.

Minako gave one of her charming smiles and nodded.

Rei slid the door to the rented room given to her by the head priestess 
closed. It&#39;d been a long day, and now the only thing she desperately 
needed was a good 4 or 5 hours of sleep. She herself knew that wasn&#39;t 
nearly enough, but it was the best she could get.

As she began to unfold her cot, something caught her eyes. It was a 
letter on the small desk by the massive window. Usually she&#39;d ignore it 
and read it over breakfast, but something just wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t let 
it go.

She dropped the cot onto the floor and headed over to the old, wooden 
table. The envelope was a crisp beige color, signifying it was from Ami.
