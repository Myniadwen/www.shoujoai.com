---Crystal Tokyo, 3043---

The city shone in the early hours of the morning, as the sun slowly made 
its way into the sky. The royal palaces rose up into the sky like a 
giant glass forest, the tallest tower in the center of the great 
megalopolis housing the royal family.

Neo Queen Serenity looked out the royal window as a smile teased her 
lips. She loved getting up before anyone else to watch the sunrise. Her 
people would be waking soon as well, and her royal court would be open 
today. It was a special occasion, the thousandth anniversary of the 
kingdom. Her kingdom.

Elsewhere, Lady Neptune was waking up next to her wife. The light slowly 
coming in through the window of their chamber shone upon the handsome 
features of Lady Uranus. She wanted to run her fingers through the 
blonde&#39;s hair, but she looked so peaceful that Neptune decided to let 
her sleep. She was about to slip out of bed to fix them both some 
coffee, when she felt it. Something was amiss.

In another royal apartment of Crystal Tokyo, Lady Pluto slept soundly in 
her wife&#39;s arms. Suddenly, her eyes opened wide as she bolted up into a 
sitting position, waking Lady Minerva up in the process.

Back at the Imperial Palace in the center of the city, Neo Queen 
Serenity looked up and saw a flock of birds flying overhead, and smiled.

The large explosion that took place quickly caused the smile to fade 
away.

The shockwave knocked the Queen off her feet. She shook her head a bit 
as she slowly got back up, the palace guards rushing in to make sure Her 
Majesty was safe. Going back to the window, her eyes opened wide in 
horror at the large cloud of dense smoke rising out of a densely 
populated area of the city. Lady Saturn, visiting the palace to spend 
time with Her Royal Highness Princess Usagi II, rushed over to the 
Queen.

&quot;My... My Lady...&quot; she began, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Queen Serenity looked over to her, tears in her eyes, &quot;The people.&quot; she 
gasped, &quot;All those innocent people. Why? What happened?&quot;

Lady Saturn simply shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know, my Queen. I don&#39;t 
know.&quot;

---Tokyo, the Present---

&quot;What box does this goes in?&quot; Makoto asked, holding up a small lamp.

&quot;Good grief, where&#39;d you find that?&quot; Kihomi asked. Makoto, Haruka and 
Mamoru had volunteered to help with the move, and were currently busy 
with packing the essentials. The teacher couldn&#39;t bring everything, and 
in fact didn&#39;t really have to. There was already plenty of furniture and 
essentials at the Outer&#39;s house. She was mainly taking clothing and 
certain objects with sentimental value.

&quot;I found it in the back of the closet.&quot; Makoto answered as she swiped 
some dust from her sweatshirt, &quot;Along with a box set of the best of 
Dixieland jazz.&quot;

Kihomi tucked a loose hanging bang behind her ear, &quot;Put the jazz 
collection in the box labeled &#39;essentials&#39; and the lamp in the box 
labeled &#39;junk&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Wait a second.&quot; Haruka interrupted. She was currently helping Mamoru 
take apart the teacher&#39;s computer for packing when she stopped to turn 
to her two fellow Senshi, &quot;Let me take a look at that lamp.&quot;

Mamoru smiled over at the blond, &quot;You think Hotaru might like it?&quot;

&quot;Possible.&quot; Haruka answered. The teacher shook her head.

&quot;Doubtful. I bought the thing at a garage sale during my college years. 
It hasn&#39;t worked in over five years. In fact, I&#39;m a bit surprised it&#39;s 
still here.&quot;

Haruka chuckled a bit, &quot;You don&#39;t know Hotaru.&quot; she answered, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know what it is about that kid and lamps, but...&quot; a knock at the door 
signaled that lunch had arrived. Going over to open it, Makoto let in 
Michiru and Setsuna, both carrying takeout bags. Michiru went to set her 
bag down on a counter while Kihomi&#39;s eyes wandered to her love&#39;s hand 
where the engagement ring was prominently displayed. Setsuna caught her, 
and smiled. The teacher smiled back as she started to move towards her.

&quot;Okay,&quot; the Senshi of the Seas asked, &quot;Who ordered the soba noodles?&quot;

&quot;Here.&quot; Makoto said, raising her hand. As she took the plastic bowl and 
chopsticks from Michiru, Kihomi took the bag from Setsuna and set it 
next to the other one.

&quot;Shrimp and rice?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;That would be mine.&quot; Mamoru called over from behind the computer desk. 
The violinist came over and took the liberty of brushing some dust off 
the future king&#39;s head and shoulders before passing him his dish and 
chopsticks.

&quot;How much more is there?&quot; Setsuna asked as she looked at the boxes. 
Kihomi scanned the room and shrugged her shoulders.

&quot;Well... Besides the computer, the CDs and DVDs there&#39;s not much else to 
bring, is there? I mean, most of my clothes are already there.&quot;

Michiru passed Haruka her dish of hibachi steak and fried rice, stealing 
a quick kiss from her wife as she did so. Going to the second bag, 
Michiru was about to pull out the rest of the food out when everyone&#39;s 
communicators went off. Pulling hers out first, Makoto answered.

&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; she asked.

&quot;A youma.&quot; Ami&#39;s voice said over the speaker, &quot;A tough one too, down at 
the electronics store by the Crown. Rei and I could really use some 
backup.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re there.&quot; Makoto said, speaking for everyone. Hanging up, she and 
the others raced out of the apartment.

---Crystal Tokyo, 3043---

The large royal hall was usually used only for public celebrations and 
private meetings between the royal princesses and advisors. Today was an 
exception, however. Today, there was to be a verdict in the royal court. 
A scientist had broken two fundamental laws of the kingdom, and in the 
process had blown up a densely-populated area of Crystal Tokyo three 
weeks ago. Over three hundred dead and at least two hundred injured hung 
over her head.

&quot;Saeko.&quot; The guard called out, &quot;Please step forward.&quot;

In the large room the woman stepped forward, her straight black hair 
hanging down her back over her light blue suit. In the room directly in 
front of her were two objects marked exhibits &#39;A&#39; and &#39;B.&#39;

Saeko scanned the angry faces of the court, and swallowed hard as she 
met the queen&#39;s eyes. Neo Queen Serenity was known as much for her mercy 
and belief that anyone could redeem him or herself as for her beauty. If 
the scientist was going to get out of this, she was going to have to 
rely on the monarch&#39;s credulity.

&quot;You&#39;re Majesty,&quot; she began, &quot;I... Look, in all scientific endeavor 
there is trial and error, but...&quot;

&quot;Trial and error?&quot; Lady Mars interrupted incredulously, &quot;Over three 
hundred innocent people are dead because of you! And on the millennial 
anniversary of Crystal Tokyo! How much more error do you need?&quot;

&quot;You seek answers.&quot; Princess Mercury spoke up, &quot;It&#39;s a scientist&#39;s job 
to ask questions and seek answers; I understand that. But there&#39;s a 
reason there are certain aspects of science that are closed off to 
investigation.&quot;

&quot;There is a very real danger in looking into time travel, as well as 
exploring into alternate universes and realities.&quot; Lady Pluto explained, 
&quot;First off, time is something that should never be meddled in, as the 
threat to the present by a mistake in the past is enormous. But beyond 
time, the dangers inherent in interdimensional experimentation make it 
forbidden under any circumstances. Every time there&#39;s ever been contact 
with an entity from another dimension, it&#39;s been hostile. Queen 
Metallia, Pharaoh Ninety, the god of blood and death Oberon, Thelema X, 
Cthulhu...&quot;

&quot;But just because in the past there were hostile forces encountered in 
trans-dimensional encounters...&quot;

&quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; Lady Minerva asked angrily, &quot;You killed over 
three hundred people! Men, women and children are dead because of your 
actions, and you still have the gall to stand before the court and claim 
your actions are justified? Have you no shame?&quot;

She narrowed her eyes, &quot;I should&#39;ve expected this from you, from all of 
you.&quot; she said spitefully as she scanned the faces of the royal court, 
&quot;All of you, keeping the truth of darkness to yourself, perpetuating the 
lie of light!&quot;

Lady Jupiter now stepped forward, the metallic-green arm she was given 
after loosing her original right arm in the war with the Star Spawn 
known as the Cthulhi shining under the lights of the chamber. &quot;Lie of 
light?&quot; she asked angrily, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

Both Lady Saturn&#39;s and Neo Queen Serenity&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Those words,&quot; 
the queen began, &quot;What have you done?&quot;

&quot;I once said something similar, hundreds of years ago when I was 
possessed by an alien force.&quot; Princess Saturn said, &quot;Is this, then, the 
fruit of your scientific investigations? The deaths of multiple 
innocents and contact with transdimensional demons?&quot;

King Endymion now stood up from his throne, &quot;Saeko, I&#39;m at a loss. I&#39;ve 
watched you closely now for the last few minutes, as well as over the 
last week of this trial. And in all that time you&#39;ve shown no remorse, 
no emotions whatsoever other than apathy. Do you have anything you wish 
to offer before the Queen and I pass judgment?&quot;

The scientist cocked a grin, &quot;Yes, I do. This!&quot; she exclaimed, pulling 
out a flash bomb she&#39;d smuggled into the chamber in her pocket. An 
intense flash of light temporarily blinded the royals and guards in the 
room. Lady Minerva blindly groped her way to where the King, Queen and 
Princess were.

&quot;Great Shield.&quot; she exclaimed, remembering her first duty to protect the 
Monarchy. In the confusion, Saeko used a second electronic devise she&#39;d 
snuck in under her tongue to temporarily disrupt the force field around 
the exhibit table. She grabbed the two objects from the table, the one 
shaped like a metallic ball and the other a type of cube. Pushing a 
button on the cube, a portal opened in time. The cube only had enough 
power for one time shift. The scientist tossed the now exhausted time 
cube aside and jumped in, not knowing or caring where she ended up.

Lady Uranus was the first to regain her sight. Looking around, she 
angrily clenched her fists, &quot;She escaped! Damn it, where&#39;s the palace 
guards?&quot;

Princess Pluto put her hand to her head, the disruption to the time 
field disorienting her to the point where she felt lightheaded.

&quot;Puu!&quot; Princess Usagi II cried out, &quot;Are you...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m okay, small lady.&quot; she said reassuringly.

&quot;The unmitigated impudence!&quot; King Endymion growled as Lady Minerva 
lowered her shield. Lady Neptune went to Pluto to check on her as the 
King continued, &quot;How did she get those things in here? I... L... Lady 
Minerva!&quot; the King gasped. The Queen, Lady Pluto and the others looked 
over to see Princess Minerva. Pluto let out a cry of fear and anguish, 
immediately recognizing what was happening.

The woman in question however was unaware of anything being wrong other 
than a sudden slight pain in her chest and a strange shortness of 
breath. She looked over to the King to ask what was wrong, only to see 
absolute horror in his face. The queen likewise looked alarmed, standing 
up from her throne and rushing toward her. Turning away from the 
monarchs, she looked to her wife who had just cried out and the Lady 
Neptune, both equally terrified by something. She then looked down at 
herself.

She&#39;d become transparent.

---Tokyo, the Present---

The thing running around looked vaguely feminine in appearance, although 
the fact she was dressed like a Viking and had blue skin was enough to 
tip one off that something was wrong. A leftover from the days of the 
Death Busters that had survived for the last decade within the Tokyo 
sewers, the thing was giving Sailors Mars and Venus a run for their 
money.

Sailor Moon soon arrived on the scene, followed by Mercury. The thing 
looked over at them and picked up a nearby car, holding it up over its 
head.

&quot;Berserker!&quot; it shouted, throwing the vehicle at the two. Sailor Moon 
ran to her right as Mercury ducked to her left. The vehicle crashed into 
the wall of a post office.

&quot;Mercury Aqua Rhapsody!&quot; Sailor Mercury shouted. The thing was able to 
move out of the way before the attack could reach her, however.

&quot;No way!&quot; Mercury gasped. Sailor Mars limped over, a nasty cut visible 
on her shin.

&quot;The thing&#39;s fast.&quot; she declared. &quot;Venus and I have been battling the 
thing now for about ten minutes, and have yet to land any attacks on 
it.&quot;

The thing picked up a second car, intending to chuck it at the Senshi as 
well.

&quot;Jupiter Oak Evolution!&quot; Sailor Jupiter yelled as she arrived behind the 
youma. Caught off guard, the thing screamed in pain as the attack 
landed. The car fell down behind it as the youma staggered forward.

&quot;World Shaking!&quot; Sailor Uranus now yelled. After the second direct 
attack, the youma lay on the ground not moving, smoke slowly rising off 
its body.

&quot;Now Sailor Moon!&quot; Uranus yelled. Sailor Moon used her Moon Spiral Heart 
Attack, quickly sending the thing off to oblivion. As Sailors Neptune, 
Pluto and Minerva arrived on the scene, they looked around to find 
everything already taken care of.

&quot;Everyone alright?&quot; Sailor Moon asked. Venus looked over from the bush 
she&#39;d landed in before Sailors Moon and Mercury had arrived and gave a 
thumbs up. The sound of footsteps alerted everyone that Sailor Saturn 
had arrived.

&quot;Sorry everyone.&quot; she offered weakly, &quot;I was kind of... Indisposed when 
you sent for help.&quot;

The others began to chuckle a bit. Sailor Minerva walked over to her and 
smiled.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry mei (niece), I&#39;m sure...&quot; a loud noise like an explosion, 
followed by a bright red light cut her off as she and the others turned 
their attention to see what was happening. The light disappeared to 
reveal a woman in a blue suit with long black hair flowing straight down 
her back.

Uranus and Neptune immediately placed themselves between her and Sailor 
Moon.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Sailor Neptune asked, &quot;And what are you doing here?&quot;

At first the lady in front of them looked frightened. Slowly, however, 
she looked around at her surroundings and smiled, &quot;No.&quot; she said to 
herself, &quot;This isn&#39;t still the royal chamber. I&#39;m in the past.&quot; Turning 
to the woman with the wavy aqua locks who&#39;d just spoken to her, her grin 
widened, &quot;The Lady Neptune, or should I say &#39;Sailor&#39; Neptune? That is 
what you go by at this time, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

The Senshi looked amongst each other in confusion. Sailor Mars helped 
Venus out of the bush as Uranus now spoke up, &quot;Neptune just asked you a 
question; who are you?&quot;

&quot;I am a scientist.&quot; she declared, &quot;A great scientist from the future, 
here to show you primitive cave dwellers the wonders of silence and 
darkness.&quot; she said as she pulled out a metallic ball with a blue lens 
on the front of it, &quot;Here; welcome to the dark.&quot;

Minerva leapt out in front of the others now as a glowing beam of blue 
light raced forward. &quot;Great Sh...&quot; before she could raise the force 
field, the Senshi of War and Wisdom was enveloped in the blue light. A 
second later, she was gone.

The scientist from the future began to laugh. Sailor Pluto&#39;s eyes opened 
wide in shock.

&quot;Minerva?&quot; she asked. &quot;Minerva! No!&quot;

---Crystal Tokyo, 3043---

The royal chamber was in chaos. Lady Minerva, now fading into 
translucency, now going back to being solid, could feel her wife&#39;s arms 
around her as the queen slowly walked toward the first of the Princesses 
to volunteer to go back to capture Saeko. Lady Uranus stepped forward in 
protest.

&quot;My Queen,&quot; the sandy blond began, &quot;Surely it would be better if I or 
one of the other outers went back instead. We have more power on our 
side.&quot;

Princess Usagi II stepped forward as well, &quot;Send me.&quot; she implored, 
&quot;I&#39;ve had experience with that time period, and...&quot;

Neo Queen Serenity shook her head, &quot;No.&quot; she said, &quot;She asked first; 
fate chose her for this. Besides, she originally came from that time 
period Usa-chan.&quot; Looking at the woman in front of her, she smiled in 
spite of herself as she pulled out a small object, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I 
still have this.&quot; she said, passing the disguise pen to the woman who 
would be going back to capture the rogue scientist Saeko and save Lady 
Minerva.

&quot;Remember the rules of engagement.&quot; Serenity said, her voice suddenly 
stern, &quot;Reveal nothing of what&#39;s to come, try to keep your identity a 
secret unless it&#39;s absolutely necessary to tell, and change nothing of 
what will happen. You are to find Saeko, place her under custody, and 
bring her back. Understand?&quot;

&quot;Of course, my Queen.&quot; she answered. The stern look in the queen&#39;s eyes 
faded as she quickly hugged her old friend.

&quot;Be careful.&quot; she finally whispered. Turning to the Princess of Time, 
she looked at her determinedly, &quot;Lady Pluto, have you got a fix on where 
she is?&quot;

The woman kneeling on the floor cradling her vanishing wife looked up 
and nodded, &quot;Early... Early twenty-first century.&quot; she answered sadly, 
wiping tears from her eyes as she reluctantly let her wife go to take up 
her staff and open the time gate. Her fellow princess, disguise pen in 
hand, paused briefly to look at her sad friend.

&quot;I&#39;ll save her Pluto.&quot; she vowed, a determined look in her eyes, &quot;I 
promise you; I&#39;ll save her.&quot; She then turned around and headed back into 
the past.

---An Alternate Reality, the Present---

Sailor Minerva slowly opened her eyes to find herself standing just 
inside of a large crater filled with water, the skies overhead almost 
completely dark. Waiting a bit for her eyes to acclimatize to the 
darkness, she slowly made her way out and shook the water from her feet.

Once outside the crater, she looked around her. &quot;Great Shield.&quot; she 
commanded, using the yellow-gold glow of the offensive weapon as a 
makeshift flashlight. All around her were devastated buildings and 
skeletons. There were thousands upon thousands of skeletons, as far as 
the eye could see. Strangely though, there were no skulls.

As a light wind blew some dust past her, all she could think of was how 
much the landscape looked like old pictures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
after the atomic blasts, or planet Minerva after the demon Babylon was 
through with it. She could feel her heart beat a bit harder as she tried 
to keep from panicking. What in the hell had happened? Where exactly was 
she?

As she tried to remain calm she noticed it; the quiet. She hadn&#39;t felt 
it before, because she was moving around enough to cause at least some 
noise. But now, standing still, there was nothing. Even the wind seemed 
to move without a sound. It was like there was a great silence, 
oppressively weighing down upon the land clothed in darkness.

Looking up into a sky bereft of even starlight, she swallowed hard. 
Looking behind her, a cry of fright almost escaped her lips. There, on 
the opposite side of the crater in front of the sea was a huge statue 
jutting up at least three hundred feet into the air. It was of a woman 
in a robe with her arms held upward as if in offering. Two great wings, 
like those of an angel, spread out behind her, and her long hair flowed 
behind her as well.

Sailor Minerva took a few steps closer. The statue wasn&#39;t smooth like 
bronze or even marble; it was textured, almost like it was a 
three-dimensional mosaic of some sort. As she reached the edge of the 
crater on her side, she realized two things that sent a shiver down her 
spine. First, the face was Hotaru&#39;s. There was no mistaking it in the 
cheeks and the area around the nose and mouth. She looked older in the 
statue, and a bit emaciated, but it was her.

And second, the figure was made up entirely of human skulls. Hundreds of 
thousands of them, perhaps a million or more, all stuck together like 
some monstrous puzzle or the atoms of some complex compound, giving the 
effect from a distance of the sweet young girl she&#39;d grown to call mei 
transformed into a grim angel of death. And in the face, that beautiful 
smile the child always had was turned into a malevolent sneer.

&quot;Guys...&quot; she whispered, feeling a sinking sensation deep within the pit 
of her stomach, &quot;Sailor Moon, Setsuna, anyone; get me out of here.&quot;</pre>
