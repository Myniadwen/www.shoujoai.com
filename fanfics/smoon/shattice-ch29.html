<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 29 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>A slightly singed and battered Sailor Iron Mouse
knelt in the dark room after yet another failure. She
squeaked in fear as she knelt before the shadowy
figure. &quot;My lady, I&#39;m sorry...&quot; the white haired young
woman quailed.

&quot;Silence!&quot; the woman&#39;s voice boomed from the
darkness. &quot;You have attacked again and again, but each
time you have failed to find the Star Seeds!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m doing my best,&quot; Iron mouse whimpered.

&quot;I&#39;m giving you one more chance,&quot; the voice said
threateningly, &quot;find me a Star Seed, or your position
is forfeit!&quot;

Sailor Iron Mouse tried to sound confident as she
stood and said, &quot;I won&#39;t fail you.&quot;

&quot;See that you don&#39;t.&quot;

The form of Sailor Iron Mouse shifted as she left the
office of the TV studio, adopting her human disguise
as she hurried away from her dread mistress. &#39;I&#39;m out
of time,&#39; she moaned, &#39;what am I going to do?!&#39;

&quot;Chuko Nezu,&quot; her assistant called aqs she hurried to
catch up, &quot;are you ready to do today&#39;s assignment?&quot;

&quot;What was it again?&quot; Iron Mouse asked distractedly.

&quot;We were going to interview Seiya Kou, for the Sunday
morning broadcast,&quot; the redhead said mildly, towering
over the other woman.

&quot;Seiya Kou?&quot; Iron Mouse murmured, a glimmer of an
idea appearing in the back of her mind. &#39;He&#39;s famous
and good looking, maybe HE has a Star Seed?&quot;

The tall redhead smiled to herself as she saw the
wheels turning in her supposed boss&#39; head. &#39;Take the
bait,&#39; she urged, &#39;or should I say bight the cheese,
little mouse.&#39;

Meanwhile, at school Ami Mizuno and Setsuna Meiou
were sharing their usual lunch break. &quot;So, you agreed
to tutor?&quot; Setsuna asked, her long green hair
shimmering darkly.

&quot;Yes.&quot; with a nod Ami munched on her rice as the blue
haired younger woman asked, &quot;You disagree?&quot;

Setsuna gracefully stabbed a sausage and chewed. &quot;I
wouldn&#39;t go that far,&quot; she answered, &quot;but be careful.
I rather suspect Seiya&#39;s intentions aren&#39;t exactly
honorable.&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Ami nodded, &quot;which is why I&#39;m insisting we
do group study sessions with Taiki and Yaten. Should
keep him out of trouble, I hope.&quot;

&quot;Very wise.&quot; Setsuna agreed as she finished up her
lunch. She smiled, &quot;Hotaru was telling me about her
and Usagi going out with Mrs. Tsukino, they had a
great time.&quot;

&quot;I know, Usagi told me,&quot; Ami agreed. She smiled a bit
sadly, &quot;I thought they&#39;d get along, considering how
similar Usagi and her mother are.&quot;

&quot;How did Usagi take it?&quot; Setsuna asked.

&quot;Pretty well,&quot; Ami reflected, &quot;though I think she was
also distracted a bit by the arrival of the Three
Lights.&quot;

Setsuna chuckled softly, &quot;Hotaru showed me her signed
CD.&quot;

Finishing up her own lunch Ami snapped the lid onto
her bento box. &quot;Today&#39;s our first tutoring session,&quot;
she sighed, &quot;wish me luck.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Setsuna said, gazing at her fondly.
&quot;You have a bit of rice on your cheek,&quot; she murmured,
bending forward and licking it away.

&quot;Setsuna...&quot; Ami shivered slightly, unaware they were
being watched.

Seiya Kou paused at the door to the doctors office,
then backed away slowly before he turned away. Yaten
blinked as Seiya returned as the white haired young
man asked, &quot;Was Ami there? I thought you wanted to ask
her a question.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s busy,&quot; Seiya said dryly, his long black
ponytail swinging as he hustled the other two young
men away.

&quot;Busy?&quot; Taiki blinked then smiled, &quot;oh ho!&quot;

&quot;Hey, we should go back....&quot; Yaten started to turn
around before Seiya grabbed him and kept them going.

&quot;Do you really want to have Ami pissed at you?&quot; Seiya
asked, &quot;Especially since we just talked her into
helping with tutoring?&quot;

&quot;Good point,&quot; Yaten conceded reluctantly.

&quot;Besides, there&#39;s a certain look in Ami&#39;s eye that
tells me I do not want to see what she&#39;s like when she
gets mad,&quot; Taiki noted thoughtfully.

Seiya looked at him in surprise then nodded slightly,
&quot;Good point.&quot;

&quot;So ready for your interview this afternoon?&quot; Yaten
asked teasingly, &quot;I&#39;ve heard the reporter is a real
cutie.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you can seduce her for good reviews,&quot; Taiki
added.

&quot;I won&#39;t dignify that with a response,&quot; Seiya sighed.

&quot;You just did,&quot; Yaten smirked.

&quot;What are you three doing, hanging out in the halls?&quot;
Ami asked curiously as she walked up to where they
were talking.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Taiki said smoothly, &quot;we were just deciding
where to look for you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ami looked at the three of them with a amused
sort of suspicion.

&quot;Nothing bad,&quot; Seiya said quickly. He smiled at her
charmingly, &quot;It just that something&#39;s come up. Do you
think we could star out tutoring session a bit later
today?&quot;

&quot;A interviewer booked a session with us just this
morning,&quot; Yaten looked apologetic, &quot;and she&#39;s too
important to cancel out on.&quot;

&quot;Or more accurately, her station is too important,&quot;
Taiki corrected.

Ami nodded slightly, &quot;That should be all right, as
long as it isn&#39;t too late.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll do our best,&quot; Seiya bowed.

With that the group of four headed back to class, Ami
largely unaware of the fame she was acquiring just by
being near them. By now the boyish young woman was
being regarded as a unofficial fourth member of the
band, and certain sharper fans were already selling
photos of her along with the members of the Three
Lights.

Of course, Seiya and the others were aware, but chose
not to tell Ami. Part of her appeal was a odd
innocence that could be disturbed by such knowledge,
and it would be difficult for her to stop her
popularity at this point anyway. So, it was probably
best just to leave her be, the three brothers had
decided.

&quot;Is she still getting all the love letters?&quot; Yaten
asked softly.

&quot;Yup, nearly as much as Seiya,&quot; Taiki nodded
seriously. &quot;It&#39;s too bad she isn&#39;t in the band, we&#39;d
be even more popular.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if Ami can sing?&quot; Yaten whispered as they
reached their class, walking inside to a chorus of
adoring female sighs.

Class dragged on till the end, only Ami and Taiki
seeming to really enjoy the work. Once the final bell
rand Seiya nearly jumped up as he sighed, &quot;Finally
done.&quot;

&quot;Till tomorrow,&quot; Ami noted, giving him a scolding
look.

&quot;Well, there&#39;s that,&quot; Yaten sighed. He brightened as
he asked, &quot;Should we go see if we can find our
reporter?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Taiki agreed.

Meanwhile, outside the school, a very frustrated Iron
Mouse transformed, the white haired young woman
drawing many glances due to her strange garb.
&quot;Mistress is going to kill me if I don&#39;t find a Star
Seed,&quot; she groaned. She brightened, &quot;I know, I&#39;ll
unleash as many Phages as I can! I&#39;ll be sure to find
one that way.&quot;

&quot;But what about finding Seiya, ma&#39;am?&quot; her assistant
wondered.

&quot;Pfft,&quot; Iron Mouse waved, &quot;he&#39;s not here, but there
are plenty of students around. One of them MUST have a
Star Seed!&quot;

&quot;Did you hear screams?&quot; Ami blinked as they slipped
on their shoes near the front entrance.

&quot;Uh...&quot; Seiya frowned, &quot;it occurs to me that we&#39;d
better call our manager, first. Excuse us, Ami!&quot; With
that the three brothers hurried off, leaving a very
relieved Ami behind.

Ami herself raced out of the building, looking for a
secluded corner to transform. Running into the garbage
area she froze, seeing that Haruka, SEtsuna and
Michiru had already gathered. &quot;Looks like we had the
same idea,&quot; she said, shutting the door as all of them
shouted their transformation phrases.

&quot;Another Phage?&quot; Sailor Pluto asked as they raced
towards the front of the building.

&quot;It could be,&quot; Sailor Mercury responded, &quot;but it
might also be a Youma too. Be prepared for anything.&quot;

&quot;Always am,&quot; Sailor Uranus answered, the sandy haired
young woman grinning cockily.

They bounded around the building then gazed in shock
at the chaos there. More than one Phage rampaged
around, while the three black bikini clad Starlights
fought to contain the damage and protect the innocent
bystanders.

&quot;About time you got here,&quot; Star Fighter said, her
black ponytail swaying as she blasted a Phage
backward.

&quot;We&#39;ll try to be more timely,&quot; Sailor Neptune replied
dryly.

&quot;Work with the Starlights to weaken the Phages,&quot;
Sailor Mercury ordered crisply, &quot;then I&#39;ll try to heal
them.&quot;

&quot;So, the Sailors are here too?&quot; Iron Mouse scowled,
&quot;doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll defeat them too and prove my
worth to the Queen!&quot;</pre>
