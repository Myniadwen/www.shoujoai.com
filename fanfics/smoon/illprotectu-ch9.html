<h1>I'll Protect You (part 9 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>This day is for me. This is what I&#39;ve been waiting for

I&#39;ll make sure this day-off is worth it

&quot;I love you Mina-chan!&quot;

&quot;I want it louder!&quot;

Rei smirked then kissed Minako

&quot;Okay, loud enough&quot; Minako said contentedly

Then they continued to hug and kiss each other

Rei suddenly cut in, noticing Minako&#39;s still wet clothes

&quot;You better take a bath; I don&#39;t want you to be sick when I take you 
back at the hotel tonight&quot;

&quot;Who said I&#39;m going back tonight?&quot; Said Minako as she smirked and took 
Rei&#39;s police cap off her head

Rei was confused

&quot;W-wait...What about&#151;&quot;

&quot;Wendy will understand, and we&#39;ll be back as early as we can tomorrow&quot; 
Minako cut as she started to unbutton Rei&#39;s police uniform

&quot;Let&#39;s take a bath...together&quot;

&quot;Is it to save time or something else?&quot; Rei teased

&quot;Both, so stop talking. This is my day off. And you must obey whatever I 
ask you, slave&quot; Said the pop star as she finally finished the last 
button of Rei&#39;s uniform

Minako noticed a plastic tucked inside Rei&#39;s slacks, she immediately 
snatched it before Rei could to get it

&quot;Well-well-well...What do we have here?&quot; The pop star said as she 
removes the seal of the plastic cover, by its shape she can tell that it 
contains CDs.

&#39;I hope it contains one of my albums&#39;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Rei protested

Minako stared at the first CD she can see, her eyes widen. She don&#39;t 
know what to react, should she be laughing, or be disappointed. The 
First CD is entitled &quot;Beethoven: Behind the Music&quot;

Then she looked at Rei, the bodyguard is blushing profusely

&quot;What? Is there anything wrong with me liking Beethoven?&quot; She asked, her 
tone rather a bit insulted

Minako couldn&#39;t control to laugh at her lover&#39;s expression, Rei only 
groaned

&quot;Rei-chan, now I figured out why you didn&#39;t have any television here!&quot; 
Teased Minako as she switched to another CD, this time it&#39;s a different 
one titled: &quot;Forever Sunset-VI&quot;

&quot;Wow Rei-chan, you also collect Forever Sunset CDs? The songs are really 
romantic in here&quot; Said Minako as she looks at the CD

&quot;Yes they are&quot; Said Rei as she started to loosen Minako&#39;s braided hair

&quot;You do have a taste when it comes to classic music...&quot;

Then finally she switched at the last CD. And you are right! It&#39;s 
Minako&#39;s limited edition CD Album

Minako looked at Rei evilly

&quot;Hmmm, I thought you were into classic?&quot; The pop star said as she waves 
the CD. She expects an explanation from her lover

&quot;Argh, I was curious okay?&quot; Rei admitted, her nose touched Minako&#39;s

&quot;Bah, admit it, you really liked me&quot; Teased Minako

&quot;Look who&#39;s talking&quot; Rei replied

They both laughed at each other. Then Minako started caressing Rei&#39;s 
fatless abdomen

&quot;Time to continue our bath&quot; Whispered Minako as she pushed her bodyguard 
rather rudely inside the bathroom

Rei couldn&#39;t describe the feeling being with Minako only in panties in a 
bath tub. Her hands were shaking when she was asked to wash her lover&#39;s 
hair and back. She is still shy to see Minako half-naked; Minako noticed 
this and turned to Rei

&quot;You&#39;ll have to start getting used to this from now on Rei-chan&quot; She 
said, she took Rei&#39;s hands and placed it starting from her face down to 
her own body. She moaned as she did that, and Rei is blushing profusely. 
Caressing Minako&#39;s body is making her out of breath

&quot;Kami, Mina-chan...I think I can&#39;t stand this&quot; Rei said, her voice is 
shaky

Minako smirked then leaned to kiss Rei passionately, she lets go of 
Rei&#39;s hands, which surprisingly remained touching Minako&#39;s body. Then 
Minako caressed Rei equally, except Minako&#39;s touch were a bit 
aggressive, causing the raven-haired girl&#39;s knees to weaken

Now Rei is moaning, Minako launched an attack of passion to her lover; 
she is mumbling every time she kisses Rei on every part of her body. Rei 
tried her very best to ride on and kiss Minako&#39;s neck, bathing the pop 
star&#39;s lovely back at the same time

&quot;Rei-chan you gorgeous tease! You didn&#39;t know how badly I wanted to do 
this to you!&quot;

Few minutes passed in the bath tub, the couple are now breathlessly 
tired, especially Minako who almost gave her 100 percent. She leaned 
tiredly at Rei&#39;s chest, which is also breathing shallow. Then Rei 
wrapped her arms around her pop star lover and caressed her smooth back

&quot;Rei-chan, don&#39;t you even wonder why you first fell in love with someone 
like me, a girl?&quot; Minako suddenly asked as she listens to Rei&#39;s rapid 
heartbeat

&quot;Actually, I do have lots of male admirers inside and outside the TNPH, 
not to mention they are all cute. But I saw something from you that all 
my admirers didn&#39;t have&quot; Rei explained

&quot;What is it? Is that my&#151;&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s your determination and your bubbly attitude, you 
naughty pop girl!&quot; Cut Rei as she predicted what Minako will say

&quot;What does that have to do with me?&quot; Minako asked

&quot;Easy, seducing me effectively is really impressive, even Kadaki-chan, 
my closest male admirer couldn&#39;t have the guts to do that to me&quot;

Minako pinched her raven haired lover, causing Rei to arch her back from 
pain

&quot;Ouch!&quot;

&quot;You&#151;! So if that Kadaki were able to seduce you, you&#39;re going to like 
him then?&quot; Minako pouted

Rei sprinkled water on Minako&#39;s face

&quot;Come on, I&#39;m just kidding! If we really are soul mates fate will always 
make a way for both of us to be together, right?&quot; Rei said

&quot;Oooh you&#39;re right, I&#39;m so sorry my gorgeous poo-chan&quot; Minako said as 
she gently rubs the part where she pinched Rei

&quot;What about you Mina-chan? Why did you suddenly liked a girl like me?&quot; 
Rei asked

&quot;Since the breakup between me and my last boyfriend, I became cold to 
men. I feel like I&#39;m fed up with them, so I busied myself in my career. 
And then I met you&quot; Minako explained

&quot;Yeah, right, a skinny Japanese policewoman&quot; Said Rei sarcastically

&quot;Hey you&#39;re not that skinny, besides, this is the first time I felt love 
with a girl. Even if there are lots of pretty women in Europe, I didn&#39;t 
even felt a single affection from them...only you affected me that 
madly, especially when you&#39;re not here by my side&quot; Minako said, she 
noticed her lover was staring at the ceiling of the bath room

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot;

&quot;Good thing I didn&#39;t nosebleed. You were really stunning&quot; Rei absent 
mindedly said

&quot;And I&#39;m really happy that I&#39;m here with you Rei-chan&quot; Minako replied

Rei looked at Minako, their eyes met

&quot;Let&#39;s get off here; my hands are starting to get pruney&quot; Rei said. Then 
both of them got off the tub and wore their bathrobes

Minako changed to her nightgown that Rei lend to her. While Rei is 
wearing tiny shorts and sleeping blouse which in her opinion, is 
comfortable to wear than nightgowns. She was about to button her 
sleeping blouse when Minako told her to leave it open. That is for a 
special purpose, Minako reasoned

&quot;Why can&#39;t I button my sleeping blouse? Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s cold in here 
at midnight?&quot; Rei pouted

&quot;Hey, no complaining. You&#39;re my slave tonight right?&quot; Said Minako 
expertly as she finds something to eat at Rei&#39;s refrigerator

&quot;Wait, I&#39;ll serve the food for us&quot; Rei said

&quot;Scram, reserve your energy. I&#39;ll be cooking for both of us&quot;

Minako sighed at the contents of food in her lover&#39;s refrigerator

&quot;No wonder you were that skinny, 90 percent of your food here are ready 
to eat, they&#39;re not even nutritious&quot; Minako said as she takes out two 
frozen foods and placed it at the Microwave oven to heat up

&quot;I love them, because they&#39;re convenient like pizza&quot; Rei said as she 
unpacks Minako&#39;s Album CD, placed the disc inside her stereo and played 
the first music entitled &quot;You Make Me Smile, It&#39;s True&quot;

Minako stopped and looked at her lover as she hears her song being 
played. Rei is staring blankly in front of the stereo, sitting 
cross-legged. Minako giggled, Rei must have been studying and 
understanding the lyrics of her song

Four songs have been played in Minako&#39;s album when the Microwave&#39;s 
buzzer sounded. Minako served the food into individual plates and opened 
a jumbo bottle of soda from Rei&#39;s supply of food in the refrigerator

Minako regarded her lover again, this time Rei is reading the booklet 
inserted from the CD, her right hand scratching her head as if she was 
confused and her mouth was mumbling something

Minako approached to look what her lover is doing. As she finally found 
out, she laughed hysterically. Rei was startled with her lover&#39;s laugh 
and dropped the booklet she was holding

Rei was trying to sing Minako&#39;s song while looking at the lyrics printed 
at the booklet!

&quot;Rei-chan, I can teach you the lyrics if you wanted to&quot; Offered Minako 
before continuing to laugh

Rei blushed but doesn&#39;t take her defeat that easily

&quot;I don&#39;t think so; your songs are too fast for a classic song lover like 
me&quot;

Minako stop laughing and approached her lover. Then she turned the 
stereo off. Rei was wondering why. Then Minako sang the song that Rei 
was trying to sing earlier, slowly and making her voice whole each 
lyric. Rei listened to her beautiful voice intently; every tone that 
Minako sings makes her head float in relaxation

Your voice is like an angel

Your eyes are like the sea

Your hair is as soft as air

Your presence is intoxicating

I feel like new when I&#39;m with you

So please baby stay

And I&#39;ll take care of you

Then Minako finished the song

&quot;How&#39;s that, Rei-chan?&quot; Asked Minako as she kissed Rei&#39;s forehead

&quot;Wow, Minako Aino sang in front of me...is that a free concert?&quot; Rei 
asked

Minako looked at Rei&#39;s eyes

&quot;Of course...NOT. Your ticket is ten thousand times more expensive than 
the front seat tickets&quot; Minako teased

&quot;And how am I going to pay for it?&quot; Rei asked while playing with 
Minako&#39;s blond hair

&quot;You&#39;ll see. Let&#39;s eat dinner, my stomach is already growling&quot; Minako 
said as she helped Rei stand up

Both the girls took their seat opposite each other

&quot;I&#39;ve never been this happy when eating a dinner with somebody&quot; Rei 
stated as she stuffs her mouth with food

&quot;Glad to hear it from you. I enjoyed my half-day off too...so much&quot; Said 
Minako as she stopped eating and watched the way Rei eat. Rei noticed 
her, and then she slowly offered Minako a spoon-full of food. Minako 
stuffed it in her mouth, and then she gave her plate to her lover, 
telling Rei to feed her, and Rei obeyed her

As they finished eating, Rei insisted to wash the dishes. Then it&#39;s now 
Minako&#39;s turn to listen to the stereo by insert Beethoven&#39;s CD. As she 
plays the music she began mimicking an orchestra conductor in a comical 
way. This made Rei laugh at her lover

Minako waited for Rei to finish washing the dishes then she took her 
lover by the waist and they started to dance in the tune of classic 
music. Then as they approach the Rei&#39;s bed, Minako pushed Rei and landed 
at the bed. Minako followed by diving at the top of her lover, slowly 
she shove Rei&#39;s unbuttoned sleeping blouse open

&quot;Ready to pay for the ticket?&quot;

-----

This is the best chapter yet, like it? I&#39;ll try to make better ones

It really makes me wonder why did I only give Minako and Rei a week to 
fall in love with each other, rather fast ne?

But the hecks with it, there are lots of things happening in a day! Like 
this afternoon I got myself into adventure by trying to find my high 
school friend&#39;s house because I needed something back from her. Guess 
what, I got lost! I walked and walked until I started to 
daydream...er...just kidding, I asked for directions, I&#39;m not that 
stupid to daydream outside heheh...

Unfortunately, the man I asked for directions gave me the wrong 
information...I don&#39;t want to tell the rest, you don&#39;t want to know!
