<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, a memory</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  I  wouldn’t have known about time travel if it weren’t for  Chibi-Usa. She had came to visit Hotaru once when I was little.  Looking back on it I’m grateful that she did.</p>
<p><u>At the  palace</u></p>
<p>“Kaiya! You have a visitor!”</p>
<p>A  small child, perhaps nine years old, paused at the call of her name  before continuing to thrash a beat up punching bag. Her target was  small…a sand filled bag, taped with duct tape against a medium  sized rock to prevent it from flying off in any given direction.</p>
<p>Everytime the small fist struck the object she felt her  hand scrape against sandpaper material and recoil roughly. It cut  into her soft female flesh, breaking blisters and causing cuts to  open and bleed. However the blonde did not back down. She didn’t  care; if she worried herself silly over such trivial matters then she  would be dressed in ‘proper clothing’. Instead of wearing her  princess attire the stubborn girl felt content with a loose, green  shirt and the long black slacks that allowed her full motion of her  body. <em>‘Hotaru would throw another fit if she caught me’.</em></p>
<p>It was obvious that she had been engaging in this habit  for sometime, three years at the least. Any observer could see the  meticulous precision she invested to transfer her body weight with  each blow, despite her tired and strained muscles. The room in which  she trained was an artificial forest, carefully cared for by large,  sturdy machines that supported the dome that enclosed it.</p>
<p>It was the princess’s favorite places to reside, an  artificial home away from home in a sense. Not being allowed out of  the palace she would often run off to the palace’s environmental  wing, whether it would be the beach one day, a desert the next or the  current rainforest habitat they all were the closest she could be to  truly being outside. The disappearance of the king and queen had been  a great lose and shock to their planet that the palace had entered a  state of a mild internal lock down. The princess’s older sister  could not be guaranteed to intervene on behalf of her younger sister  if an emergency did occur.</p>
<p><em>‘They did this to me, it’s  because of them that I’m locked up like some animal, like some  prized possession!’ </em><strong>Whoop</strong>! The target groaned from  another direct blow. <em>‘I would’ve tried to escape a long time  ago but they may have resorted to locking me in my room, knowing  those cowards’. </em></p>
<p>Her rage started to get the  best of her normally composed nature until her ears caught a soothing  melody. There was a small waterfall to the right, an excellent place  where an exhausted person may cool off after training… although  Hotaru was against such actions for the fear of germs.</p>
<p>Another punch was delivered to the bag. <strong>Whack</strong>! <em>‘Maybe  if I hit softer, she won’t find me’. </em>The girl may have  seriously considered this until she thought,<em> Then again there’s  the waterfall…I wonder who’s she brought this time?’</em> Following the climax of her battle rhythm she quickly recovered from  the recoil of her last attack and jumped backwards, then directed her  momentum upwards forcing herself airborne. In the first move of her  attack she round house kicked an imaginary person in the air with her  right leg.</p>
<p>“Hi-yaah!” A few falling, green leaves  scattered out of the path of her blow.</p>
<p>She allowed  her body to follow through the motion for a few seconds before  willing her right leg to drop and initiate the second part of her  assault. Still with a partial centripetal force Kaiya changed the  horizontal motion to vertical. She swung her left leg sharply upwards  to full height, maximizing the potential energy. In one slight but  critical motion she directed the heel towards the ground and shot leg  first straight downwards to her target as a hawk to its prey. Gravity  was on her side.</p>
<p>“HaaaaAH!”    Following contact there was a <strong>Kapoof</strong> as the target broke at  its seems. Covered with sand Kaiya sat where she fell with a  childlike pout that played across her facial features. ‘<em>That’s  the third time this week! I have got to practice power control!” </em></p>
<p>Unfortunately the dust clouds of sand which were freed as  a result of the mishap had given away her location.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!”</p>
<p>Kaiya  winced. ‘<em>Here it comes. </em>Hotaru paced quickly, as fast as her  long, black dress would allow her towards the sand-covered girl with  a shocked look of her pale face. ‘<em>The princess speech of what  are you doing and where’s your dress…’</em></p>
<p>“What are  you doing? Where’s your dress? Oh, you knew we were having a guest  coming over today, training should’ve been the last thing on your  mind!” She scolded as she pulled the girl away from the deformed  sandbag. Bent down on one knee Hotaru proceeded to dust the sand off  Kaiya’s face and hair. Once reasonably satisfied she then tugged  disapprovingly at the younger girl’s tattered attire. “A princess  shouldn’t display such destructive behavior.” She lectured. “What  would mother and father think?”</p>
<p>“…They aren’t coming  back, are they?”</p>
<p>Hotaru flinched at the morbid question.  She should’ve known better than to bring up the subject in the  first place. Matters relating the king and queen’s fate was taboo  in their family, a topic Hotaru definitely did not want to discuss if  she could avoid it. The senshi of destruction couldn’t tell her  little sister the possible truth that their parents were never coming  back. Even she did not know of their whereabouts. Alive or dead they  simple disappeared one day without a trace. Kaiya wouldn’t admit it  but she cried all day, she was only a toddler but she seemed to  acknowledge something was now missing in her life. ‘<em>She probably  doesn’t remember them at all</em>.’</p>
<p>A wave of  sadness hit her. She almost didn’t feel the small tug on her dress.  Automatically Hotaru looked up expecting to see a pair of sad eyes  staring into her own but she found that Kaiya was no longer looking  at her.</p>
<p>“Who’s that?”</p>
<p>Tracing the small finger’s  direction Hotaru had realized that she had forgotten about their  visitor.</p>
<p>“Ah! Gomen ne, Kaiya, this is Chibi-Usa.”</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>“…That’s not her real name  is it?”</p>
<p>The pink haired, teenage girl being addressed  blushed slightly. Many people were too afraid to ever question her  odd nickname because she was the moon heir and here was a child  acting so bold and clueless. <em>‘She hasn’t changed, except for  the fact that she’s younger’.</em> This brought a smile to her  lips. <em>‘How amusing’.</em></p>
<p>Kaiya eyed the  visitor closely this time, deciphering the form with whatever her  eyes pick up. The girl’s pink hair was up in a sort of pigtails,  the tops where the hair was being held together looked very peculiar.  As for the white dress she wore Kaiya observed that it was decorated  lavishly with laces of all patterns. However there was one golden  lace that waved horizontally across her chest. The dress itself  virtually covered all of Chibi-Usa’s flesh spare for leaving her  slim arms and her shoulders slightly exposed. There was a small  surprise when the other girl moved forward towards the two sisters;  you’d notice how long her hair really was. The ends of her unique  styled hair ranged down to just past her waist. <em> ‘It’s so  long’.</em></p>
<p>Chibi-Usa had finally reached the  pair and she bent down to shake the smallest girl’s hand.</p>
<p>“Ile,  it’s just a nickname people call me.” She softly answered the  innocent question. “It’s good to see you again Kaiya chan.”</p>
<p>The  smaller girl cocked her head to the side, puzzled at what the older  girl had just said. <em>‘I don’t remember ever meeting her in my  life’.</em></p>
<p>“We’ve met before?”</p>
<p>The  atmosphere immediately grew tense. Chibi-Usa frowned for a moment at  the younger girl’s response. <em>‘Wait…she wouldn’t…’</em> Her eyes widened, her memory mentally correctly herself, realizing  her slip up.</p>
<p>‘Ano…” Chibi-Usa sent a quick pleading  glance to Hotaru, who had understood the situation immediately.</p>
<p>“Ah!  Of course you have!” Hotaru suddenly covered for her pink haired  friend.</p>
<p>“Nani?”</p>
<p>“When you were younger, you  probably don’t remember.” Hotaru assured the youngest girl,  waving her hands gesturing wildly. Chibi-Usa sweat dropped. ‘<em>’Don’t  overdo it Hotaru’.</em> For the most part it seemed to work and the  child shrugged. “Chibi-Usa wanted to come see you, so I’ll let  you two get aquatinted again.” Hotaru turned to part when she  whispered “Try not to slip up again.” to her friend and then  left. Her footsteps could be heard echoing as she made a mad dash  away from the room.</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence.  The child and the pink haired teenager eyed each other suspiciously,  expecting the other to make the first move. <em>‘Ah! What was I  thinking? She’s still a kid why would she remember anything? I  should talk first…’</em></p>
<p>“So what do you want to do Kaiya  chan? Would you like to hear some stories?” ‘<em>Get washed up’? </em>She had almost lost her composure as she surpressed a giggle.  “Play hide and seek?”</p>
<p>The little girl seemed to consider  the two options. She’d rather go back to play fighting but the girl  in front of her didn’t seem like sparing partner material. Finally  Kaiya decided to test this girl’s patience.</p>
<p>“Hide and  seek.”</p>
<p>“Alright, would you rather hide or  seek?”</p>
<p>“…Seek.”</p>
<p>“So you know how it goes  right? I’ll hide and you count to some number before coming to find  me. Sound good?”</p>
<p>Kaiya felt her pride bruise  slightly. <em>‘Who does she think she is? I’m not that dense’.</em> She wanted to frown but held it back and chose to nod her head and  smile.</p>
<p>“Be sure to give me enough time to hide and NO  peeking!”</p>
<p>Kaiya  watched the older girl take off and started to count. <em>‘Oh, I’ll  give you enough time’.</em></p>
<p>“Ichi, ni, san, shi, go…”</p>
<p>Kaiya stopped and peered around. Once she was sure  Chibi-Usa had left Kaiya sighed. <em>‘Well I should repair my broken  training bag or at least get a new one. It should only take a few  minutes’.</em></p>
<p><u>An hour later…</u><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Kaiya slowly trucked back into the forest room. <em>‘I  was really hungry’.</em> She then walked back to their initial  meeting spot, by the waterfall and spotted the raging  teenager.</p>
<p>“YOU! Where did you go!”</p>
<p>Kaiya eyed the accusing finger that pointed in her direction. ‘<em>Didn’t  she know it was rude to point?’</em></p>
<p>“I went looking for  you.”</p>
<p>“OUTSIDE THE ROOM?” The teenager huffed.</p>
<p>“You  never mentioned boundaries so I only assumed that included the rest  of the palace. Were you hiding in here? Must’ve missed you  somehow…you’re quite the professional player.”</p>
<p>Chibi-Usa was dumbfounded. What was she to think? Kaiya wasn’t  exactly like this when she was older and she had only met the younger  version of the girl that stood looking nonchalantly at her. ‘<em>But  she is still a child…’</em></p>
<p>“How about we switch to plan  A and have a story time.</p>
<p>“…What kind of stories?” Kaiya  inquired, trying not to sound too curious.</p>
<p>Her  older sister mentioned that their parents used to read to her every  night before they disappeared, however the child could not remember  anything of the experience at all. Hotaru had tried to continue the  little tradition in their parent’s place but the older girl was  often away due to conferences and meetings.</p>
<p>“Well…I’m  not very good at made up stories but…”</p>
<p>“What’s  that?”</p>
<p>Slightly surprised and irritated that she was  interrupted, Chibi-Usa reluctantly looked to where the younger girl  was pointing There was an object hanging around her neck, a  small key. The older girl had thought she hid the object carefully in  her garnets but she was proven wrong. <em>‘It must’ve jiggled out  from all my hiding’.</em> She thought back to climbing a tree,  almost slipping several times, her arms wildly swung trying to keep  her balance.</p>
<p>“…” ‘<em>Should I tell her the truth?’.’</em></p>
<p>Kaiya steadily stared down the older girl in front of her.  She wanted to know, there was a strong, indescribable feeling inside  her chest told her that whatever powers the small object contained,  it was something she was going to need. Maybe she wouldn’t need it  now but who knows.</p>
<p>“Well…It’s a time key.” Chihbi-Usa  finally replied tensely.</p>
<p>There was another pause.</p>
<p>“Have  you ever used it?”</p>
<p>“Hai. I’ve gone to the past with it  when I was little…But there was a good reason for it” She quickly  added. She now felt the desire to brag in the child’s  face.</p>
<p>Kaiya’s facial features had lit up. She had always  wondered what things were like in the past but what she really wanted  to know was information about her parents. She hated to admit it but  she really couldn’t remember them very well and although she felt a  strong sense of hate for them she would rather not judge someone  blindly.</p>
<p>“What was it like? The past I mean? Did you meet  my parents?” Kaiya asked, her heart was beating rapidly. Its  pounding in her ears threatened to block out the older girl’s  words. Seeing the older girl give a small nod Kaiya’s excitement  escalated “What were…they like?”</p>
<p>The tension in the  room broke. Chibi-Usa was happy that someone wanted to listen to her  experiences. They both walked over to the cool shade under a  gathering of trees, a short distance from the waterfall. Prepping  herself for the atmosphere Kaiya plopped herself into the older  girl’s lap and Chibi-Usa began.</p>
<p>Kaiya listened  intently to every detail of the girl’s story. There were times  where the younger girl would “Ooh” or “Ahh” in awe. There was  so much that she didn’t know, being stuck in the palace for her  entire life, the outside world, even if it was the past thrilled her.  She allowed herself to be swept up in the moment, allowing the older  girl’s words take her through fierce battles, the goofy school life  and sleepovers with friends. <em>‘I want to do that’.</em> Kaiya’s  thought rang out throughout her head. Then Chibi-Usa finally said  something that broke her trance.</p>
<p>“Time traveling is very  dangerous, even Setsuna was reluctant to allow me  passage.”</p>
<p>“Setsuna?”</p>
<p>“The guardian of the gate  of time, also known as Sailor Pluto. Not too much is known about her,  even though I talk to her time to time I know very little about her  myself.” Chibi-Usa looked up to peer at the sky through the  transparent dome ceiling. “It’s already getting dark… I should  be going home before mother worries about me.”</p>
<p>Kaiya slid  off of the moon heir’s lap onto the ticklish grass that covered the  floor. Picking herself up the older girl made her way towards the  room’s exit. Stopping short of the doorway she looked back at Kaiya  who was watching her movements like a hawk. <em>‘She’ll need a  bath’.</em> Chibi-Usa chuckled but then stopped when it hit her.  Looking down she cringed when she saw the dirt on her dress. ‘<em>I  forgot that Kaiya was roughhousing before our talk. I can’t allow  mother to see this, she may think that I’ve gotten into a fight.’</em> Her mother always jumped to conclusions. The last thing she needed  was being locked up in her own palace because of a false alarm.</p>
<p>At that moment Hotaru had almost bumped into her.</p>
<p>“It’s  getting late, you need to-“ There was the pause as Hotaru stared at  the condition of her friend’s dress.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know…Can I  borrow some clothes?”</p>
<p>Hotaru gave Kaiya a little glare, in  her mind she wasn’t sure if Kaiya was completely innocent of the  deed. It was well known that the young heir at times could be a  mischievous prankster.</p>
<p>“I’ve got an idea, let’s go to  the hot springs!”</p>
<p>“But…I really have  to go soon Hotaru.”</p>
<p>“I hardly get to see you. You spent a  lot of time with Kaiya already, please?” She coaxed. “ Besides  you can relax while your clothes get cleaned. You know all of mine  are dark colored and your mom would think something worse if you came  home in mourning clothes. And don’t think about it, Kaiya’s are  too small for you.” Hotaru quickly added, knowing what was going  through her friend’s mind.</p>
<p>“I guess… I have  no choice.” Chibi-Usa sighed. She was secretly happy that she had  an excuse to spend more time with her friend, they were always too  busy to talk because of all the meetings that have taken place  lately. Her parents had thought their perfect world would stay as it  was, but Rei had sensed an evil force approaching in the near future.  Already preparations were being made to form the second generation of  sailor senshi. Unfortunately Kaiya was one of them although the girl  probably did not know her fate. It was sad to think that such a happy  and carefree child such as the one she had just spent the evening  talking to would feel such a burden. They all would.</p>
<p>Chibi-Usa  then followed Hotaru to the hot springs where they caught up on all  the things they’ve missed together.</p>
<p><strong><br />
  </strong><u>End of  memory</u><strong><br />
</strong><u></u></p>
<p><u></u>Glaring down in her hand Kaiya  felt her gaze pierce the small key that she grasped so tightly. It  was a stroke of luck that Chibi-Usa forgot the key in the hot  springs. Even luckier that I found it the next day before the staff  or Hotaru. Since the moon heir didn’t seem to miss it, I’ve been  keeping it. I’ll probably give it back to her later but right now I  need it!</p>
<p>The pink light was gone. I found myself staring  into a dark colored void of space. The walls shifted between a  mixture of purple, black and blue. It’s cold. I better get out of  here quickly before I’m caught. Whoever Pluto is, I have this  feeling that I don’t want to mess with her. Who would want to get  on the bad side of the guardian of time right?</p>
<p>If  I remember correctly, according to Chibi-Usa’s stories there was a  main route…but I should probably avoid it, I’m trespassing after  all aren’t I? Let’s try…this way. Diving into the wall of space  to my direct left I felt myself being sucked in till I disappeared  into a different corridor.</p>
<p>Further down the deep void of  space Setsuna’s brow twitched. She was sure that she had felt  something intruding in the passage of time. Who? It was too early to  tell, but her instincts told her that it was not Chibi-Usa. The young  princess personally knew the dangers of time travel. She was also now  grown up enough to know it would be stupid and rash to brave an  unnecessary and dangerous trip just to see the guardian of time.  However this brought Setsuna back to square one. If not  Chibi-Usa…then who? Is it an enemy? Something didn’t seem right.  The presence was descending backwards to the past, not the future.  However in the future time frame that it was escaping there was no  attacking evil force, at least yet. Whatever or whoever r it was,  they were trying to avoid any sort of detection; breaking through the  time walls was a desperation attempt. If you strayed from the path  you’d easily get lost. She paused and finally decided. <em>‘I  can’t wait around for this presence to appear, this could be  something big and if I screw up it could transform events into dire  consequence.’<br />
  </em><br />
  “Take…no chances…” She darkly  muttered. “Pluto deadly scream!”</p>
<p>A bright light shot out  of the staff she carried, sending a miniature, planet shaped ball of  energy into the passage of time. It whooshed away with, screaming its  battle cry.</p>
<p><strong>Wrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</strong></p>
<p>I was still  fumbling my way through the unknown territory. Guessing and checking  you could say. Already I’ve crossed several different corridors.  But the odd part is I thought I’d be spotted by now…maybe I’ll  be lucky and escape without any problems. The idea seemed to relax my  muscles but I can’t relax, not yet. Feeling my leg muscles tense up  again, I continued forward, dodging anything that looked suspicious,  trying to be best of my ability to avoid touching anything. Tracking  through time wasn’t easy; anyone could get lost doing this. Minutes  passed but it felt like an eternity, already my mind started to feel  the uncertainty of doubt. Each corridor mimicked the same, eerie  appearance.</p>
<p>“No…I can’t fail, I’ve trained hard for  this moment… nothing will stop me!” My resolution came out  thorough clenched teeth.</p>
<p>As my eyes squinted, looking for  the exit I desired, something suddenly rushed past my right  shoulder.</p>
<p>“What the?”</p>
<p>Then I heard  it.</p>
<p><strong>Wrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</strong></p>
<p>“Gah!”</p>
<p>I had  just spotted the bright light and barely dodged it, escaping it  narrowly through another time wall. Landing upright, I instinctively  eyed my surroundings. Back on the main path, however I’m wasn’t  sure if I had passed the guardian of time or if she awaited me  further ahead.</p>
<p>The hesitation in my mind  disappeared upon hearing the deadly attack come back for another  round. Time to get moving! Rushing forward, I felt my body push my  limits. This was my life on the line, if I didn’t succeed who knows  what would happen to me. Hotaru’s pouch whipped at my legs. I  wouldn’t ever see Hotaru again …and I’ll never get revenge  against my parents. Their faces, their voices, who they were, all of  it gone. It’s almost like they never existed. They abandoned  me…Now they’ll feel a world of hurt, even if I die trying!</p>
<p>A  bright light opened up in front of me. There was no thinking  required, without hesitation I lunged for it. Pluto’s attack had  reached me in the same instant. Everything in my being coiled up  waiting for the pain that was sure to follow but a purple light from  Hotaru’s pouch burst forth and miraculously brought up a weak  shield.</p>
<p>The attack still hit but I was sure it  had being considerably weakened. With the extra momentum I felt my  body fall into the passage of light. The next moment I was falling.  Falling from where? There was open sky and below…the sea? Did it  work? Did I fail? My thoughts were drowned out by waves of  exhaustion.</p>
<p>“I can’t…open my eyes…anymore.” The  last word, barely audible whisper.</p>
<p>Darkness took me and I  welcomed it.</p>
