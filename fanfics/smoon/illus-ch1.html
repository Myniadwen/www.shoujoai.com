<h1>Moonlit Nights (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hi, everybody! ^-^ How are you all? We really love
hearing from you so after reading the story please e-mail us your
thought&#39;s on the subject. ^^ Anyway, this story was written along with
Minako, the newest member. We decided rather than change the name to
Amazoness Trio to change it to the Quartet (Yay!!! Who gets to be
PallaPalla?). We don&#39;t have a fourth member yet, but we can hope. ^^
This story takes place several years after Sailormoon Sailor Stars.
ChibiUsa &amp; Hotaru are both 15 years old. For technical things about
the story: (and we&#39;re really sorry if we screw any of this up ^^)
The legal age to get married in Japan is 16.
Ikuko and Kenji are Usagi&#39;s parents. Shingo is Usagi&#39;s brother. Usagi
is married to Mamoru and lives with him while ChibiUsa continues to
live with Ikuko, Kenji, and Shingo.
That&#39;s about it for now.  Thanks to everyone who reads our stories. ^-^

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ChibiUsa rolled over in bed, not quite asleep, but not yet awake.
She pulled the blanket around herself tighter, trying to get back to
sleep.
      &quot;Wake up, ChibiUsa,&quot; she heard a familiar voice say. She rolled
over again, trying to ignore it. &quot;Come on, ChibiUsa-chan. Wake up,&quot;
the voice repeated.
       &quot;I&#39;m too tired to go to the banquet today. You and dad go,&quot;
ChibiUsa mumbled sleepily. She felt the weight of the bed shift as
someone sat beside her.
       &quot;I&#39;m not your mom, Odango-chan,&quot; the voice said, amused by the
girl she was trying to wake up.
       &quot;Good,&quot; ChibiUsa said satisfied. &quot;Then I&#39;m going back to
sleep.&quot;
        Hotaru started absentmindedly running her fingers through
ChibiUsa&#39;s soft pink hair. &quot;Odango-chan,&quot; she said sternly. &quot;If you
don&#39;t get up you&#39;ll be late for school.&quot;
       ChibiUsa sat up in bed, trying to find out where she was. She
blinked her eyes several times before focusing on a half clothed
Hotaru. She at her lover. &quot;I could get used to waking up to this.&quot;
       Hotaru blushed when she saw ChibiUsa&#39;s gaze lower along her
body. &quot;It was great waking up with you by me,&quot; Hotaru said smiling
back at ChibiUsa. &quot;Now if only you&#39;d wake up before making us both
late.&quot;
       ChibiUsa pulled the blanket over her head. &quot;If I&#39;m at your
house it means it&#39;s the weekend, right? Please say there&#39;s no school
today...&quot; ChibiUsa had had many ideas about what she and Hotaru could
do that day after waking up beside her, but they were all for nothing
if she had school.
       &quot;Sorry, Odango-chan, but its a school day. Usagi&#39;s parents let
you spend the night probably because they think I&#39;m a responsible
young lady and that I&#39;d get you to school on time. Which is what I
intend to do, so they&#39;ll let you stay over on school nights more
often. You aren&#39;t a morning person, are you, ChibiUsa-chan?&quot; Hotaru
asked as she pulled her skirt on.
        &quot;I can be, if the conditions are right,&quot; ChibiUsa answered
before yawning. She pulled the blanket down. She blushed when she
realized she wasn&#39;t wearing anything under the blanket. &#39;I&#39;m not used
to waking up naked in Hotaru&#39;s bed. I hope we do this enough that I
can get used to it. That would be fun,&#39; ChibiUsa thought.
        &quot;And what would those be?&quot; Hotaru asked innocently. ChibiUsa
giggled. That look rarely meant Hotaru was innocent.
        &quot;Well, first we&#39;d have to stop that silly idea of yours about
going to school. And second, you&#39;d have to get out of those school
clothes,&quot; ChibiUsa said quietly.
        &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be willing to help. Now get up and get
dressed, before I have to dress you myself,&quot; Hotaru said in warning
tones. ChibiUsa pulled the blanket up over her head again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Several minutes later, an exhausted looking Hotaru walked out
of her room with ChibiUsa. ChibiUsa&#39;s clothes were rumpled and in
disarray.
        &quot;I told you I would do it,&quot; Hotaru panted. &quot;We could have
taken a shower together if you&#39;d waken up earlier,&quot; she said as she
and ChibiUsa headed for the stairs.
        &quot;You should have tried to wake me up. That would have been
great before school,&quot; ChibiUsa said regretfully.
        &quot;I tried. You said you wanted to sleep, so I let you sleep a
little longer and took one by myself.&quot; Hotaru looked at ChibiUsa.
&quot;Don&#39;t you remember?&quot;
        ChibiUsa laughed nervously. &quot;Not really. Like you said, I&#39;m
not a morning person. I don&#39;t do well this early.&quot;
        &quot;Maybe I can help you,&quot; Hotaru said softly. She leaned towards
the pink haired girl. One arm went behind ChibiUsa, stopping at the
small of ChibiUsa&#39;s back. She pushed deeply into the kiss. ChibiUsa
half closed her eyes as her hands started to wander over Hotaru&#39;s
body. She settled into the kiss with her hands on either side of Hotaru&#39;s
slender waist. Their breath mingled as the girls kissed passionately,
their tongues touching.
        ChibiUsa heard some footsteps coming up the stairs. She pulled
away from Hotaru, startling the dark haired girl. Hotaru looked at
ChibiUsa worriedly to see what was wrong.
       &quot;You two better get going if you want to get to school on
time,&quot; Setsuna said as she walked past them hurriedly.
       Hotaru stared at ChibiUsa, realizing why her lover had pulled
away. &quot;Come on, ChibiUsa,&quot; she said angrily.
       ChibiUsa flinched. She was surprised that Hotaru was upset. She
knew Hotaru hated pretending that they weren&#39;t a couple, but she&#39;d
never made the dark haired girl angry because of it before. Hotaru
started down the stairs.
        &quot;Taru-chan, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; ChibiUsa said as she tried to catch up
with Hotaru. She ignored ChibiUsa&#39;s apology and continued towards the
door.
       &quot;You forgot your backpack upstairs,&quot; Hotaru said without
looking back at her. She opened the door and walked out.
        ChibiUsa hesitated for a moment. &quot;Hotaru, matte!&quot; she
yelled before running back upstairs to get her backpack.

        ChibiUsa caught up to Hotaru down the road. She tried to catch
her breath as she walked alongside the angry dark haired girl. She
looked down at her shoes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Taru,&quot; she said in a small voice.
        Hotaru walked along for a moment in silence before answering.
&quot;I love you, ChibiUsa. Why am I only allowed to love you at certain
times? Why only when we&#39;re alone? I have to live a lie in front of my
parents. They&#39;re the people I trust the most, and I can&#39;t tell them
that I&#39;m in love. You pushed me away because Setsuna-mama was coming.
You pretended I didn&#39;t mean anything to you in front of her. You&#39;re
the most important thing in my life. That&#39;s why it hurts so much that
you pretend we&#39;re only friends until no one&#39;s looking. It&#39;s such a
strange feeling being in love, but it feels great. I don&#39;t want to
hide it.&quot; She finally turned to ChibiUsa. &quot;When? When will we tell
everyone? When can we stop this stupid charade?&quot;
        ChibiUsa couldn&#39;t meet her gaze. She was ashamed of herself.
She knew she&#39;d hurt Hotaru badly that morning. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry,
Hotaru. I love you. I don&#39;t want to hurt you.&quot; She stepped forward and
gently clasped Hotaru&#39;s hand with both of her own. She looked into
Hotaru&#39;s beautiful purple eyes. The raven haired girl still looked
angry and depressed. Hotaru blinked and her gaze started to soften.
ChibiUsa kissed her hand before continuing. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry about this
morning, but I&#39;m still not used to everything, yet. I know you don&#39;t
want to keep this up, but I&#39;m not ready to tell everyone yet.&quot;
        &quot;Why not?&quot; Hotaru demanded, some of her anger returning. &quot;If
you love me, then why do we have to keep it a secret. What are you so
afraid of?&quot; Hotaru pulled away from the pink haired girl and began
walking off again.
        ChibiUsa grabbed Hotaru&#39;s hand and turned her around. She
looked at her sadly. &quot;This is all so new to me. I want to make sure
everything works out for the best. I love you, Taru-chan, and the
last thing I&#39;d want to do is hurt you. I hate knowing that you&#39;re
sad. I&#39;m sorry about not telling everyone, but I&#39;m still shy about
the two of us. I don&#39;t know what to say or what anyone will think.
You&#39;re more important to me than that, though. I don&#39;t want to hurt
you anymore. Please, wait for me a little longer.&quot;
        Hotaru stared at her for a moment. She sighed. &quot;It&#39;s so hard
to stay angry with you, Odango.&quot; Her arms went around the pink haired
girl. &quot;Do you promise we&#39;ll tell them sometime soon?&quot; she asked as
she held the other girl.
        &quot;Hai,&quot; ChibiUsa said, nodding. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry about this
morning.&quot; She was glad Hotaru wasn&#39;t angry with her anymore, but she
still felt bad for how she&#39;d acted. The two girls hugged before
continuing on their way. &quot;You really want to tell everyone, don&#39;t
you?&quot; ChibiUsa asked Their fingers intertwined as they held hands.
        &quot;If we told everybody, we wouldn&#39;t have to sneak around
anymore. We wouldn&#39;t have to pretend there&#39;s nothing between us,&quot;
Hotaru said as she looked into ChibiUsa&#39;s crimson eyes.
        ChibiUsa knew she wasn&#39;t being fair to the dark haired girl.
Hotaru hadn&#39;t wanted to hide anything from the beginning. She had
strenuously protested against hiding that they loved each other in the
first place. She had finally relented because she didn&#39;t want to hurt
ChibiUsa, but she continued to try to convince ChibiUsa to do
otherwise every chance she got.
        &quot;Come on, Odango-chan. Let&#39;s not worry about it for now.&quot;
Hotaru smiled. &quot;Besides, eventually we&#39;ll either have to tell
everyone or they&#39;ll find out anyway. It would be hard to pretend
we&#39;re just friends after we get married.&quot;
        ChibiUsa laughed. She always got nervous when they talked
about marriage. How was she supposed to propose to her best friend?
&quot;I was thinking it might be nice to get married when we were sixteen,
like my mom. It&#39;s only about a year away. Or we could wait until
we&#39;re 17 when we&#39;re more mature.&quot;
        &quot;How about now?&quot; Hotaru asked calmly. She loved the pink
haired girl and dreamed about marrying her.
        &quot;Now?&quot; ChibiUsa asked surprised. &quot;But we can&#39;t now. We have to
tell everyone first. And I&#39;ve got to talk to my parents first and see if
you can come back to the future with me or if I need to stay in the
past with you. We still have the high school entrance exams and...&quot;
        Hotaru cut ChibiUsa off. &quot;I&#39;ve already got an engagement ring
for you.&quot; Both girls stopped suddenly on the sidewalk. ChibiUsa stared
as Hotaru pulled a small ring box out of her backpack and brought it
up for ChibiUsa to see.
        &quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; breathed ChibiUsa.
        Hotaru was pleased with ChibiUsa&#39;s reaction. She&#39;d been
worried that ChibiUsa would protest against her buying an engagement
ring already. &quot;How long have you had it?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.
        Hotaru blushed. &quot;Since a couple weeks ago. I&#39;ve been wanting
to marry you for a long time.&quot;
        &quot;Taru, we&#39;re too young,&quot; ChibiUsa argued nervously.
        &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Odango-chan. I&#39;m nervous about it, too,&quot; Hotaru
said.
        &quot;Nervous about what?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.
        &quot;About proposing,&quot; Hotaru said smiling. &quot;If you&#39;re too shy to,
just tell me and I&#39;ll be the one to propose. I&#39;m kind of confused
about which of us should propose and I thought you might want to. The
only reason I haven&#39;t yet is because I haven&#39;t actually worked up the
courage to ask you yet. I just want you to know that I really want to
marry you. You mean so much to me.&quot;
        &quot;Hotaru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said, not knowing how to reply.
        Hotaru sighed again. &quot;Could I at least see what you&#39;d look
wearing it for now?&quot; she asked hopefully.
        ChibiUsa nodded shyly. &#39;I didn&#39;t know Hotaru was looking so
far ahead with the two of us. I&#39;m so lucky to have her. She&#39;s really
thinking about us.&#39;
        Hotaru slid the ring onto ChibiUsa&#39;s slender finger. Hotaru
held up the pink haired girl&#39;s hand and looked at her longingly. She
couldn&#39;t wait for the day when ChibiUsa was her bride.
        &quot;How is it?&quot; ChibiUsa asked. She flexed her finger and looked
at the ring. ChibiUsa was blushing a deep red as she looked from the
ring to the dreamy look on Hotaru&#39;s face.
        &quot;You look beautiful as always, Odango-chan. You just look like
my cute Odango-chan that&#39;s engaged to me,&quot; Hotaru said smiling. She
brought ChibiUsa&#39;s hand up higher and kissed it before sliding the
ring off. She placed it back in the box before putting it back in her
backpack. &quot;After seeing you wear the ring, I&#39;ll have to propose soon.
I really want to marry you now.&quot;
        ChibiUsa waved her arms. &quot;Taru-chan, We&#39;ve got plenty of time.
You shouldn&#39;t be too hasty about things like this. We should wait till
we&#39;re older.&quot;
        &quot;Well, then you could always say that to me when I propose,&quot;
Hotaru said as she walked towards the school gates. She faced ChibiUsa
and walked in backwards. &quot;But could you really say no to me?&quot; She
asked smiling.
        &quot;No one ever told me having a girlfriend would be so much
trouble,&quot;ChibiUsa said quietly.
        &quot;Or so much fun. If your girlfriend happens to be your best
friend, it just makes it even more interesting,&quot; Hotaru whispered.
        ChibiUsa giggled. Hotaru smiled. All the tension she had been
feeling earlier had drifted away. &#39;I know ChibiUsa-chan&#39;s worried
about telling everyone, but soon I&#39;ll be able to get her to go along
with it. I just have to be ready to convince her. I&#39;m sure I can.&#39; Her
smile broadened. She mouthed the words &#39;I love you&#39; to the pink
haired girl.
        The pink haired girl smiled at her and whispered back. &quot;I love
you, too.&quot;
        Both girls held hands for what seemed like an eternity before
Hotaru walked off to her class. ChibiUsa turned around and saw Momoko
standing there. The Chinese girl had her purple hair done up in a
single odango. She had an odd expression on her face as she looked
from ChibiUsa to the retreating form of Hotaru.
        &#39;Did she see anything?&#39; ChibiUsa thought frantically. &#39;What
did we do? Hotaru seems pretty obvious about us even when we are in
public.&#39; &quot;Ohayo,  Momo-chan,&quot; she said nervously.
        Momoko stared at her strangely for a second before replying.
&quot;Ohayo, ChibiUsa-chan. How are you?&quot;
        &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; ChibiUsa said. She smiled, glad that Hotaru wasn&#39;t
angry with her anymore. &quot;Actually, I&#39;m feeling great right now.&quot; She
spun around in a circle. &#39;I&#39;ve felt better than I ever had since
Hotaru and I got together. Now that Hotaru&#39;s happy with me, it feels
like it&#39;ll be a great day. I&#39;ve slept better then usual even though
we stayed up late talking and enjoying our time together.&#39; She sighed
happily while blushing at the thoughts of what she and Hotaru had
done the night before.
        Momoko leaned towards ChibiUsa, the strange look returning to
her eyes. &quot;You&#39;re fine, huh? Then why are you blushing?&quot; the lavender
haired girl asked.
        ChibiUsa looked down. &quot;Because...&quot; she said simply.
        &quot;Because what? I&#39;m your friend. What aren&#39;t you telling me?&quot;
Momoko asked. Momoko and Diana were the closest people to ChibiUsa,
besides Hotaru. She didn&#39;t keep things from either of them often. She
didn&#39;t know if she was ready to tell Momoko about what she and Hotaru
shared, but if Momoko was already on to it there wasn&#39;t a lot she
could do.
        &quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; ChibiUsa said unconvincingly.
        &quot;It has something to do with Hotaru, I know that. Why won&#39;t
you tell me?&quot; Momoko asked sadly.
        &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Momo-chan, but I can&#39;t tell you yet. Soon, though.
I promise.&quot; ChibiUsa waved at her and started walking for class.
        &quot;ChibiUsa, please...&quot; Momoko started.
        &quot;I can&#39;t. Not yet,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
        Momoko sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll see you in class, ChibiUsa-chan.&quot;
        &#39;I&#39;m sorry, Momo-chan,&#39; ChibiUsa thought. &#39;Someday.&#39;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Hotaru looked around for her pink haired girlfriend. She
spotted a pair of familiar odango on the other side of a bush. She
made her way around it and smiled at ChibiUsa. ChibiUsa was sitting
and enjoying the shade with her bento box next to her. ChibiUsa
looked up at Hotaru. She smiled back and patted the ground beside
her. &quot;Sit down, Taru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said happily.
        &quot;I&#39;m glad I found you. Not that you&#39;re too hard too find,&quot;
Hotaru said as she sat down next to ChibiUsa. She brushed a leaf out
of the other girl&#39;s pink hair.
        &quot;I&#39;m glad you found me, too,&quot; ChibiUsa said quietly. Hotaru&#39;s
hand went under her chin. ChibiUsa looked around quickly. She could
hear some of the other students, but none of them could see the two
girls. As soon as she turned back, she felt Hotaru&#39;s soft lips press
against her own. She giggled lightly as Hotaru kissed her again.
ChibiUsa&#39;s hand went down past the raven haired girl&#39;s skirt to one of
her legs, clothed by the dark stockings she wore. ChibiUsa knew she
should stop now. If someone walked past and ChibiUsa pulled away
again, Hotaru would be angry. If she didn&#39;t, whoever was there might
very likely notice the two girls. Hotaru&#39;s tongue pushed between The
pink haired girl&#39;s lips. Hotaru moaned softly as they kissed.
        Both girls turned as they heard a rustling from the bush
behind them. They blushed as ChibiUsa pulled her hand away from
Hotaru&#39;s thigh.
        &quot;Diana?!&quot; ChibiUsa said surprised as the small gray cat
walked out of the bush. She had a paper in her mouth. She set it down
in front of ChibiUsa. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you needed this or not, Small
Lady, but you left it at home. It&#39;s some of your notes.&quot;
        &quot;Arigato, Diana. You didn&#39;t have to,&quot; ChibiUsa said, glad
that it had been her guardian cat.
        &quot;Don&#39;t mention it. I&#39;m glad I could help.&quot; She began to leave,
but turned back. &quot;Hotaru-san? Were you teaching Small Lady how to
kiss? I&#39;d just like to say that it looked like you were doing a great
job.&quot; Diana smiled happily and walked off. Both girls eyes went wide
as they sweatdropped. Hotaru blushed deeper. Diana was ChibiUsa&#39;s age,
but she still seemed very innocent.
        Hotaru and ChibiUsa sat in silence for several minutes.
Before they could talk about what happened, Ruruna and Naruru popped
up.
        &quot;Hello, ChibiUsa-chan! Hi, Hotaru-chan!&quot; Naruru said happily.
        &quot;Have you two heard about the dance?&quot; Ruruna asked.
        &quot;What dance?&quot; Hotaru asked confused.
        &quot;We didn&#39;t think so. Anyway, there&#39;s going to be a dance this
Friday.
Ruruna and I are going to make sure everybody knows since we&#39;re both
helping to organize it.&quot; Naruru smiled.
        &quot;Friday? But today&#39;s Wednesday!&quot; ChibiUsa said.
        &quot;Yeah, so you don&#39;t have much time to get a date for it, but
we know you can if you try,&quot; said Ruruna. &quot;If you need any help, just
ask us.&quot;
        &quot;We&#39;ve got to go for now, but we&#39;ll see you two later. Ja
ne!!&quot; Naruru and Ruruna waved as they walked off.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ChibiUsa walked home as soon as school had ended. Diana was
on top of her head and chatting away about what had happened the day
before while ChibiUsa had been at the Outer Senshi&#39;s house. Usagi had
made her curry while visiting and this time it didn&#39;t look like
garbage. Mamoru had visited along with her and eaten the tasty food,
Rei and the other Senshi had visited and talked to the two about
&quot;Sailor business&quot; mostly for old times sake since the only senshi
living there was ChibiUsa.
        &quot;Diana,&quot; ChibiUsa interrupted, &quot; What do you think about
Hotaru?&quot;
        Diana climbed down so that she could see her mistress&#39;s face.
She was smiling. &quot;Hotaru is a very nice friend,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s nice
she&#39;s teaching you how to kiss. Now when you get a boyfriend you can
be ready.&quot;
        ChibiUsa smiled. &#39;She&#39;s teaching me more than kissing.&#39;
ChibiUsa stepped up to her front door and walked inside.
Usagi&#39;s mother, father and brother were watching a movie.
        &quot;Good afternoon, ChibiUsa,&quot; Ikuko said smiling, Kenji nodded
in greeting. &quot;Usagi&#39;s upstairs, probably talking on the phone again
with that boyfriend of hers.&quot;
        &quot;Bo-boyfriend!&quot;,&quot; Kenji said frilling up like a cats coils.
        &quot;Dad,&quot; Shingo said trying to calm him down. &quot;She&#39;s been
married for years now. Of course she&#39;s talking to him on the phone. I
think your having flashbacks since she&#39;s visiting.&quot;
        &quot;A boyfriend who likes to run up our phone bills,&quot; Kenji
commented.
        Shingo buried his face in his hands in frustration. &quot;Dad....&quot;
        ChibiUsa smiled and walked up to Usagi&#39;s room and felt
Diana jump down from her head. The small grey cat nuzzled next to her
mother. Chibi-Usa sat down next to Usagi, and Usagi turned and smiled
at her future daughter. She had been talking on the phone.
        &quot;Konichiwa ChibiUsa,&quot; Usagi smiled. &quot;How did you like
spending the night with Hotaru-chan?&quot;
        &quot;Interesting,&quot; she answered. &quot;I made it to school on time.
Usagi... you love Mamoru, ne?&quot;
        Usagi looked at ChibiUsa strangely, and answered. &quot;Yes.&quot;
        &quot;Then do you think I could fall in love?&quot;
        &quot;ChibiUsa, most people would say you&#39;re too young, but I fell
in love with Mamo-chan when I was fourteen. Your over that age and I
think you could fall in love any time now.&quot;
        &quot;Arigato, Usagi,&quot; ChibiUsa said and got up to leave.
&#39;I already am,&#39; she thought.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;So what do you think?&quot; Hotaru said over the phone.
        &quot;I don&#39;t know &#39;Taru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa answered fidgeting with
the phone cord. Hotaru had just asked ChibiUsa to the dance. The one
that Ruruna and Naruru had told them about at lunch.
        &quot;Come on, you&#39;re not still afraid are you?&quot; Hotaru
answered a bit of anger in her voice.
        ChibiUsa knew that all that Hotaru wanted was to be able to
be open about their relationship. ChibiUsa&#39;s heart beat grew faster.
&#39;What do I say?&#39; &quot;Taru you know I love you, but....I just can&#39;t. Not
yet,&quot; ChibiUsa said. &quot;You know the risks that come with any kind of
love that grows. Look at everything Usagi and Mamoru went through.
We&#39;d have a lot more to deal with if we told everyone.&quot;
        Hotaru sighed. &quot;Odango-chan,&quot; Hotaru answered, &quot;I don&#39;t know
how long I can take keeping this a secret...I just want what
Michiru-mama and Haruka-papa have.&quot;
        &quot;And all I want is what my mother and father have,&quot; ChibiUsa
replied, &quot;I&#39;ll go with you &#39;Taru, but this isn&#39;t my official
outcoming.&quot;
        &quot;In other words &#39;friends only&#39;?&quot; she asked.
        &quot;...it has to be,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
        &quot;Alright Odango-chan, for you.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Hotaru was lying in her bed. She had several pillows propped
up behind her, to keep comfortable. She was trying to read. It
usually helped her when she was thinking about something too much.
This time, though, it didn&#39;t seem to be helping at all. She reread a
sentence over again. She set down the book in frustration, unable to
concentrate on it. She reached over to a nightstand and picked up a
picture frame she had on it. She smiled when she looked at the
picture. It was of her and ChibiUsa. She had an arm around
ChibiUsa&#39;s waist, while the pink haired girl had an arm over her
shoulder. They were both smiling oddly and Hotaru was blushing
slightly. It was from before they&#39;d talked about their feelings for
each other. At the time it had just been a silly pose they were doing
for the camera, but she remembered how ChibiUsa had clutched her
shoulder and brought her closer before the picture was taken. The
picture was one of her favorites. Her fingers brushed the glass over
the image of ChibiUsa. Hotaru rolled over and sighed. &#39;I don&#39;t want
to go as friends,&#39; she thought. &#39;I don&#39;t care what everyone else
thinks. I want them to know I love her. I want to go as her
girlfriend. We&#39;ve been best friends for the longest time. Why does
she want to keep acting like that&#39;s all we are? A dance sounds fun
and I want her to take me.&#39; She hugged one of her pillows tightly
against herself. &#39;Odango-chan.&#39;
        Hotaru heard a knock at the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; she said.
        The door opened and Haruka walked in. &quot;I brought you some tea,
Hime-chan.&quot; She handed her daughter the cup.
        &quot;Arigato, Haruka-papa,&quot; she said gratefully. She felt better
as she sat with Haruka. She drank a bit of the warm liquid, relaxing.
Haruka ruffled Hotaru&#39;s hair.
        &quot;Haruka-papa, I&#39;m not a little girl anymore. I&#39;m 15,&quot; Hotaru
protested.
        Haruka laughed. &quot;You&#39;re growing up, but both you and ChibiUsa
still seem like little girls. I&#39;m glad about that. I wouldn&#39;t want
you growing up too fast. I remember when you were a small baby.&quot;
        Hotaru giggled. &quot;That was only a couple years ago.&quot;
        &quot;See? You&#39;re already growing up too fast because you had to
rage and be Sailor Saturn again. So how was school?&quot; Haruka
asked.
        Hotaru sighed and hugged her pillow again. &quot;It was pretty
good. I had a really nice lunch with ChibiUsa.&quot;
        &quot;And you didn&#39;t have much homework, so the day seems to have
gone well. What else happened, Hime-chan?&quot; Haruka looked at the
younger girl.
        &quot;I found out that there&#39;s going to be a dance this Friday,&quot;
Hotaru answered.
        Haruka smiled. &quot;Ohhhh...So the girl you want to go with
either doesn&#39;t seem to know you exist or you don&#39;t think she&#39;d go
with you.&quot; Hotaru stared at Haruka. &quot;Okay, maybe that isn&#39;t it. Have
you found someone to go with? You can always take ChibiUsa. I think
she has a crush on you.&quot;
        Hotaru stared at Haruka again. She teased Hotaru about
ChibiUsa every so often even though Hotaru hadn&#39;t told her about
the two of them. She didn&#39;t really know what to say. Before, she
always told Haruka that they were only friends, but that had been
before she&#39;d admitted to herself that she was in love with the pink
girl.
        &quot;So why wouldn&#39;t anyone want to take a pretty girl like
you?&quot; Haruka continued.Hotaru sighed, glad that she hadn&#39;t had to
come up with a response.
        &quot;It&#39;s complicated, Haruka-papa. I&#39;m going to the dance, but
not the way I want to,&quot; Hotaru tried to explain.
        Haruka nodded. &quot;It sounds confusing. Is there anything I can
do to help?&quot;
        &quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Hotaru said. She looked up. &quot;Do you think
ChibiUsa-chan can spend the night with me this Friday? She could come
back here with me after the dance.&quot;
        &quot;I don&#39;t see why not. Let me talk to Setsuna and Michi first.
Otherwise, I&#39;m sure she can,&quot; said Haruka.
        &quot;Thank you, Haruka-papa,&quot; Hotaru said happily. Haruka smiled
at her as she picked up the empty tea cups and prepared to leave.
        Haruka turned to Hotaru before leaving. &quot;Hotaru, don&#39;t worry
about it. If there&#39;s one thing I know, its that you can&#39;t run from
fate. Whatever happens, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll turn out alright.&quot;
        Hotaru contemplated what Haruka said. &quot;Thanks, Haruka-papa.&quot;
        &quot;No problem. If you need any help, just ask. Sorry about the
dance, but I hope you enjoy yourself anyway.&quot; Haruka opened the door.
        &quot;I&#39;m sure I will.&quot; Hotaru waved as Haruka departed. Hotaru
sighed and fell back on her bed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The next day after school, Hotaru and ChibiUsa were at the
Crown Cafe discussing the dance.
        &quot;What if you wore boys&#39; clothes, like Haruka-san?&quot; ChibiUsa
asked.
        Hotaru sweatdropped. &quot;I don&#39;t think that would work. I&#39;d just
look like a girl cross-dressing.&quot;
        &quot;We could give you a short pony tail,&quot; ChibiUsa suggested.
        &quot;I&#39;m glad you want to go as a couple, but I still don&#39;t think
that would work. That does give me an idea. What if you let your hair
down? You always wear it in the odango hair style at school, so
no one&#39;s seen you with it down before,&quot; Hotaru said smiling.
        &quot;For one thing, everyone would see me with you, so if they
didn&#39;t think it was me, they&#39;d still think that you were going with a
girl,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
        Hotaru smiled a bit more. &quot;I don&#39;t mind if they know I&#39;ve got
a girlfriend. You&#39;re the one who doesn&#39;t want anyone to know.&quot;
        &quot;Even then, I&#39;m the only girl with pink hair at school.
Everybody would just think I was trying a different hair style at the
dance.&quot; ChibiUsa sipped her drink.
        &quot;I like my idea, even more if everyone would notice that
we&#39;re going out. I&#39;ve got another idea, but you&#39;re not going to like
it,&quot; Hotaru said. She waved to Unazuki as she served another group of
people.
        &quot;What is it?&quot; ChibiUsa asked, curious.
        &quot;The reason you don&#39;t want to go with me as your date is
because then everyone would find out about us, right?&quot; Hotaru asked.
        &quot;Yeah....&quot;
        &quot;Then all we have to do is tell most of our family and
friends today, and we won&#39;t have to worry about them finding out from
other people who were at the dance.&quot; Hotaru smiled at the pink haired
girl again.
        ChibiUsa stared at Hotaru. &quot;But the dance is tomorrow.&quot;
        &quot;So if we get moving now, we should be able to tell everyone
in time. We could always have them meet us at the Hikawa shrine,&quot;
Hotaru said. &quot;Or we could tell them all on Saturday. I doubt they&#39;ll
have found out by then.&quot; Her hand clasped ChibiUsa&#39;s beneath the
table. &quot;You should relax, Odango-chan. The whole reason I want to go
to the dance with you is because it sounds fun. And because it&#39;s with
you,&quot; she sighed, &quot;even if we are going as friends. I still don&#39;t
promise I&#39;ll act like your best friend.&quot;
        ChibiUsa squeezed Hotaru&#39;s hand back. &quot;How can I relax if you
give me reasons to worry.&quot; She smiled as her fingers intertwined with
Hotaru&#39;s.
        &quot;And you wouldn&#39;t have to worry if you&#39;d just let us come out
to everyone. I&#39;m sure everyone would be happy that we have each
other.&quot; Hotaru leaned across the table and kissed ChibiUsa lightly in
the public cafe. ChibiUsa kissed her back tentatively, trying to
control her blushing. Her tongue pushed into Hotaru&#39;s mouth. Their
tongues met as they kissed. As they pulled away, ChibiUsa noticed
that the dark haired girl was blushing as well.
        &quot;Taru-chan?&quot;
        &quot;I understand how you feel about everything, ChibiUsa. I&#39;m shy
about these things too. But I love you and I want everyone to know
that. I understand why you don&#39;t want to tell everyone yet. I&#39;m
nervous about it as well, but I don&#39;t want to have to hide how much I
love you,&quot; Hotaru said in a soft voice.
        ChibiUsa smiled at her. &quot;I&#39;m glad you understand. You always
understand me.&quot;
        &quot;It&#39;s because I can read you like a book,&quot; Hotaru said with a
smile.
        &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; Then what am I thinking right now?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.
She stuck out her tongue.
        &quot;You&#39;re thinking that since neither of us have much homework,
it would be fun to go over to my house and cuddle for a couple of
hours.&quot; Hotaru said with her chin on her hands.
        &quot;I was thinking we could go get Ice Cream or something to eat,
but that does sound a lot better,&quot; ChibiUsa said happily.
        &quot;Darn. I was sure you had your &#39;I want to cuddle look&#39; just
then, not your &#39;let&#39;s spend Hotaru&#39;s allowance on food&#39; look.&quot;
Hotaru gave her another quick kiss before they got up to leave.
