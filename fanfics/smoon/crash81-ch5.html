<h1>Bubblegum Crisis: Crash '81 (part 5 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/crash81-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Sylia was riding along fast when she saw a crossway ahead. Without 
warning, Priss&#39; horse went racing by in front of her. The animal was 
scared as it raced by, its body cut up and bleeding. Priss was nowhere 
in sight.

Sylia immediately realized that something was wrong.

Turning her horse, she began to race her mare down the side road where 
the horse had just come from. Fear started to grip her when she thought 
of what could&#39;ve caused such injuries to her fellow Knight Saber&#39;s 
steed.

------

Reika watched as the woman in front of her continued to back away, 
pulling a glass shard out of the wound to her abdomen as she did so. She 
could hear a stifled cry escape her enemy from the pain both in her 
abdomen and her other wounds, especially the one in her wrist.

She wasn&#39;t expecting the sight in front of her. The Knight Saber didn&#39;t 
look like a demon, nor was she laughing maniacally like a villain in a 
play would when the end was near. The woman in front of her was 
bleeding, in intense suffering, and scared. Even with the faceplate on 
the front of her blue helmet, Reika could tell from her body language 
she was afraid.

She had tried to prepare herself for this. The woman in front of her was 
an enemy. She was evil. She&#39;d killed her unarmed sister in a Buddhist 
temple. And now, she was receiving the punishment she deserved. All 
Reika would have to do now would be to use her blade on her and it would 
all be over. Why was she hesitating?

The sound of hoof beats pulled her out of her thoughts. As her opponent 
passed out from blood loss and pain, Reika saw a second one, in silver 
armor, appear from around a corner. The second Knight Saber started to 
race toward her, when a knife thrown from a nearby alleyway took down 
her horse, causing the rider to land in a nearby snow bank. Even in the 
absence of any streetlamps, Reika could tell who&#39;d thrown the weapon.

&quot;Kou!&quot; she shouted, as a group of armed men, all wearing similar white 
tiger masks, surrounded the silver warrior. One of them, slightly taller 
than the others, turned to her.

&quot;We&#39;ll take care of this one.&quot; he yelled back, &quot;You finish off the blue 
one.&quot;

As the men surrounding the other Knight Saber all pulled out their 
swords, Reika turned back to the prone body in front of her. The enemy 
was still breathing, but wasn&#39;t moving otherwise.

&quot;Why do you hesitate?&quot; Kou shouted. &quot;Kill her!&quot;

Reika stared at her opponent, and felt her chest tighten. The Knight 
Sabers were evil. They were responsible for her sister&#39;s death. And as 
she continued to watch her chest rise and fall, a tear ran down her 
cheek. She couldn&#39;t bring herself to do it. She couldn&#39;t kill.

&quot;Irene, forgive me.&quot; she whispered, &quot;I failed you.&quot;

A gunshot blast pulled her attention away from her fallen foe.

------

One of the assassins surrounding Sylia fell at the gunshot. Four more 
blasts, followed by four more dead members of the White Tiger, quickly 
followed. In the darkness, a horse and rider shot out of a side street. 
The rider jumped off the horse, pulling out a long katana and landing on 
the nearest clan member. Sylia took advantage of the distraction to slip 
something onto her hand.

Unable to see their opponent, the men rushed forward into the darkness. 
The rider leapt over one of the enemy, twisting her body in midair and 
landing on her feet facing his back. She sliced down his back, turned to 
her right, and kicked a second one in the scrotum just before 
decapitating him. A third tried to come up behind, only to be run 
through when she turned the sword in her hand and thrust the weapon 
backward. Walking out of the shadows into the moonlight, her spurs 
jingling as she strode forward, she came into view of Sylia and the few 
White Tiger members left.

&quot;No one,&quot; Jeena Malso yelled as she pointed at Sylia with the tip of her 
blood stained sword, &quot;Gets to kill that bitch but me!&quot;

Taking advantage of the fact that everyone&#39;s attention was focused on 
the one-armed swordswoman, Sylia swung at a nearby Tiger member. Her 
fist shattered the bottom of his mask and broke his jaw, just before she 
slashed his chest open with her sword held in her other hand. The tall 
one, who appeared to be the leader, yelled something in Chinese. At that 
all the assassins retreated, including the woman by Priss.

Jeena was about to run after them, when Sylia grabbed her.

&quot;Let me go.&quot; she growled. Sylia shook her head and motioned over to 
Priss, at which point Jeena&#39;s demeanor changed. She turned from Sylia 
and ran toward the prone figure, images of her friend Hibiki-chan being 
murdered in front of her racing through her head.

Jeena reached the fallen Knight Saber first, Sylia coming up seconds 
later. As the leader of the Knight Saber removed the brass knuckles from 
her hand, Jeena sheathed her sword and knelt sadly down by Priss.

&quot;Congratulations.&quot; she said acerbically, &quot;You killed another.&quot;

Sylia&#39;s lower lip began to quiver behind her faceplate as she fought to 
keep her eyes from filling with tears. Jeena grabbed hold of the 
shuriken and yanked it from Priss&#39; right wrist. Priss&#39; eyes opened wide 
at the sudden intense pain and she let out a scream, swinging out 
blindly with her left fist and punching Jeena in the right eye as she 
did so. As Jeena fell backwards, Priss slumped back down as she blacked 
out again. Sylia knelt down and carefully picked Priss up.

&quot;That broad&#39;s crazy!&quot; Malso yelled as she clutched her face.

&quot;Jeena, I need your help.&quot; Sylia said.

&quot;You what?&quot; she asked in disbelief.

&quot;We can still save her, but only if we get her to the Silky Doll now. 
Please.&quot; she finished in a pleading tone.

Jeena looked at her former leader for a second or two before shaking her 
head. Bringing two fingers to her lips, she let out a whistle. Within 
seconds, her horse appeared and galloped up to them.

------

&quot;...my eye. She popped me right in the...&quot;

&quot;...how? Someone tell me how...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re precious Sensei&#39;s leadership, that&#39;s how!&quot;

Priss slowly became aware of the voices surrounding her and the warmth 
of the room she was in. From the way the voices were echoing she guessed 
she was in the pit. She could feel that her helmet had been removed, and 
someone was trying to unlace her body armor without jarring her. She 
could also feel a pair of hands holding her left hand, and a dull 
throbbing pain throughout her entire body.

&quot;Where&#39;s Romanovitch with the hot water?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Romanova, and I&#39;m right here. Henderson and Nigel will be down 
soon. They&#39;re getting the instruments ready.&quot;

The voices sounded like they were under water at first, but slowly they 
began to become clearer. Priss felt her chest armor being slowly 
removed, and unconsciously winced at the pain it caused. Some of the 
blood from her abdominal wound had congealed and was stuck like glue 
between her and the armor and underlying clothing. As the garments were 
removed, it tore at her wound, causing intense pain.

As the garments covering Priss were slowly being removed, she felt 
something like a warm rain drop fall on her hand, followed by a second. 
She opened her eyes a bit to see her beloved silently weeping, tears 
falling on the hand she held in hers. Sylia was removing her armor, Nene 
was setting up a tray for Henderson and Nigel to use, and Jeena was 
resting against the far wall, her arm crossed across her chest. The 
black eye she was sporting almost caused Priss to laugh in spite of the 
situation.

Linna, who made it quite clear to everyone involved she wasn&#39;t about to 
leave her love&#39;s side, suddenly felt Priss&#39; hand squeezing hers. She 
looked over to see her looking up at her, a forced smile on her face.

&quot;Koibito (beloved).&quot; she rasped out, rubbing the back of her geisha&#39;s 
hand with her thumb.

Linna sniffled a bit as she cupped Priss&#39; cheek in her hand, bending 
over to kiss her forehead. &quot;Ai shite&#39;ru yo (I love you).&quot; she said as 
she ran her fingers through Priss&#39; hair. From across the room, Jeena 
rolled her eyes.

&quot;Not you too.&quot; she said in an annoyed voice. Looking over at Nene, she 
eyed her suspiciously. &quot;Hey Romanovski, you&#39;re not...&quot;

&quot;For the last time, it&#39;s Romanova! And no, I&#39;m not.&quot;

Sylia observed all silently as she finally finished undressing Priss. 
Nene turned away from her naked comrade as footprints at the stairs 
marked the arrival of Nigel and Henderson.

Henderson looked down at Priss and winced. He&#39;d seen her and the others 
injured before, but it still didn&#39;t make things any easier. He could 
remember a time before the Knight Sabers, before Sylia and even Dr. 
Steven Stingray, when he was a front line medic for the British back in 
1850 during the Opium Wars, at the height of the Taiping Rebellion. He 
remembered those days, helping England enforce the opium trade upon the 
oppressed Chinese, with a great deal of shame on his part. Sylia always 
thought it was family loyalty that kept him with her. It was more than 
that. There was also the hope that, by helping her and her girls do what 
they had to do, he could maybe in a small way make up for sins of the 
past.

Nigel, who would be acting as his assistant, looked over and saw Jeena. 
His normally stoic, emotionless demeanor gave way to disgust.

&quot;Malso.&quot; he growled. &quot;What in the bloody hell are you doing back here?&quot;

Jeena grinned, &quot;Well well, if it isn&#39;t my favorite limey Nigel 
Kirkland.&quot;

As Nigel glared angrily at Jeena, Priss turned away from Linna to look 
at Sylia.

&quot;Where... are the other two?&quot; she asked, &quot;The... the bookworm and her 
friend with the big bosom?&quot; Sylia chuckled in spite of the situation.

&quot;Yomiko and Nancy went out to see if they could find any sign of our 
attackers.&quot; she answered. She looked over to see Henderson produce a jar 
of something from out of a black medical bag. Linna likewise saw the 
jar.

&quot;What is that stuff?&quot; she asked, both out of curiosity and concern for 
her love.

Henderson looked over to the former geisha and smiled. &quot;It&#39;s called 
ether.&quot; he explained. &quot;It&#39;s been around for close to forty years now. I 
obtained this bottle on the black market. It&#39;s going to put Priss here 
to sleep until we&#39;re done fixing her up.&quot;

&quot;Black market?&quot; Sylia asked, &quot;But, how do you know it&#39;s safe? And why 
not just use chloroform?&quot;

&quot;Because the supplier didn&#39;t have any chloroform, and this stuff is said 
to be better; it has less of a tendency to induce vomiting and it 
doesn&#39;t stink as badly. And as far as the safety level... If we do 
nothing, she&#39;s going to die. I trust the source, but if it is bad...&quot; 
Henderson took a deep breath and continued, &quot;Never mind. Look, this 
stuff is highly explosive, so I would strongly suggest you all blow out 
all the candles and gaslights down here except for that one in the 
corner of the back wall until I&#39;m finished administering this. 
Otherwise, when I release this cork, we&#39;ll all be blown to bits.&quot;

Priss and Linna squeezed each other&#39;s hands as Henderson placed an 
object over her mouth and nose, telling her to count backwards from one 
hundred as she did so. Soon, the pain, her beloved, and the entire world 
faded away as Priss slipped into unconsciousness.

------

&quot;How do you do that? The paper stuff, I mean.&quot; A husky, deep voice 
asked.

&quot;I&#39;m not really sure myself. It&#39;s just a gift I&#39;ve always had.&quot;

Priss opened her eyes to find that she was now in one of the rooms of 
the house Linna and her were sharing. She was wearing a very beautiful, 
feminine looking kimono, and someone had taken the time to braid her 
hair, tying off the ends with little paper ribbons.

There was a throbbing pain from the stitches Nigel and Henderson had 
given her, and her ribs and abdomen were tightly wrapped in bandages. 
She looked over to her right to see Yomiko Readaman and Haruka Ten&#39;ou 
lounging around drinking tea, Haruka in her police uniform and Nancy in 
her typical brown dress, her hair unkempt a bit around the sides.

Her right arm in a sling, she sat up resting her weight on her left arm. 
Still light headed, she looked out the window to see the sun setting; 
she&#39;d slept all night and through most of the following day.

Yomiko looked over and smiled as she brought her hands together in joy. 
&quot;Aah!&quot; she cried out happily, &quot;Priss-san, you&#39;re awake!&quot;

Priss smiled a bit. Normally, she hated chronically happy people and 
avoided them like the plague; they always seemed like fakes to her. With 
Yomiko it was different. She had a genuineness to her.

Priss looked over to Haruka and raised an eyebrow. &quot;I&#39;m surprised to see 
you here.&quot; She admitted. Haruka smiled.

&quot;Me and Michiru are becoming close.&quot; she said a bit sarcastically, 
&quot;Because I like Michiru, I&#39;m concerned about her and anyone close to 
her. Linna is her only living relative, and I don&#39;t want anything 
happening to the woman Michiru&#39;s cousin loves.&quot;

Priss stared at her a few seconds before laughing. &quot;Smart ass.&quot; she 
said, just before making a pained face. &quot;Ow... it hurts to laugh. 
Speaking of Linna-chan, where is she?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in the next room over with Michiru and Nancy-san.&quot; Yomiko 
answered before looking down. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; she added.

Priss looked at her puzzled, &quot;Sorry? For what?&quot;

&quot;If me and Nancy-san hadn&#39;t come to you...&quot;

Priss shook her head. &quot;We would&#39;ve become involved whether or not you 
two had joined in.&quot; Turning to Haruka, &quot;Have the police come up with any 
leads yet on either the flying machines or my attackers?&quot;

&quot;Nothing yet.&quot; she said, annoyance showing in her voice, &quot;This would 
have to happen with our foreign visitor here.&quot;

Yomiko looked at her funny. &quot;Foreign visitor?&quot; she asked. Haruka nodded.

&quot;Reika Chang. She&#39;s visiting Tokyo to give a performance in a little 
less than three weeks. We&#39;re joining forces with the British Military to 
provide her with security. I...&quot; she was interrupted by a low grumble 
escaping Priss&#39; stomach. Yomiko smiled as she got up.

&quot;You&#39;re hungry.&quot; she said matter-of-factly. &quot;I&#39;ll go see if Linna-san 
has anything to eat.&quot;

As Yomiko left, Priss turned to Haruka. &quot;Chang. That&#39;s Chinese, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

Haruka looked at her a bit puzzled. &quot;Hai, she&#39;s Chinese. She&#39;s been 
living in France for the last few years. Why?&quot;

&quot;My attacker was Chinese.&quot; Priss said. &quot;Never mind, it&#39;s probably just a 
coincidence. So,&quot; she said, holding out her hand to the handsome young 
woman in front of her, &quot;Want to help me to my feet?&quot;

Haruka smiled. &quot;Sure.&quot; She said as she helped Priss up, allowing the 
older woman to rest her weight on her shoulder. As Priss slowly limped 
along, she turned her attention to her attire.

&quot;So tell me, who picked out this kimono for me?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I think it was Linna.&quot; she answered. Priss chuckled.

&quot;Sylia and her are always trying to get me to dress more feminine.&quot; she 
said. &quot;I expect you&#39;re going through the same thing with Michiru.&quot;

&quot;Actually, she&#39;s fine so far with the way I dress.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lucky.&quot; Priss said, reluctantly finding herself starting to like 
the officer. &quot;Did Linna also do this?&quot; she asked, taking her left hand 
off Haruka&#39;s shoulder to hold up a pony tail.

&quot;No, actually you have Nancy to thank for that. She was a bit bored, I 
guess. Yomiko helped.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guessed that.&quot; Priss said, noting the paper bow. She and Haruka 
entered the next room, to find Linna and the others waiting for her.

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: I chose the name &quot;Hibiki&quot; for the dead Japanese Knight Saber 
in honor of a former pen pal of mine (hello Roll Hibiki, wherever you 
are )

Next Time: With Priss out of commission for a bit, our two friends from 
the British Library decide to do some snooping on their own. Next 
chapter, fun with The Paper and Miss Deep.</pre>
