<h1>Inner Crisis, Outer Conflict (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Haruka lifted herself up from the bed and looked down upon Michiru&#39;s 
sleeping form. Leaning on one elbow, she ran her hand through her 
lover&#39;s soft hair, smiling as Michiru&#39;s lithe body pressed against her 
own, even as she slept. There was no sound in the grey morning 
stillness, except for the soft susurrus of Michiru&#39;s breathing. 

Haruka pressed her lips into Michiru&#39;s hair, felt a slight mumble of 
pleasure, and gently got out of the bed. Michiru snuggled down into 
the blankets and slept on. Quickly Haruka dressed, then left the room 
they shared. She moved about the apartment silently, picking up a few 
items and placing them in a bag. She opened the door, and casting a 
glance towards the bedroom, moved back into the main room, jotted a 
quick note. On her way out the door, she picked up one more small item 
and placed it in her bag. The door clicked softly behind her as it 
closed. 

********** 

Michiru awoke, and stretched. Her skin was still warm with the touch 
of her lover, and she replayed in her mind the passion they had shared 
the evening before. She noticed the silence in the apartment, but did 
not wonder at it. Haruka was a light sleeper at best, and was often up 
in the early hours, running or riding her motorcycle. She would return 
later with a fresh perspective on the day. Michiru threw on one of 
Haruka&#39;s tailored shirts, and left the bedroom. 

She made tea and tidied up the kitchen, smiling at the remains of 
their dinner the night before. Once again, her body tingled from the 
memory of Haruka&#39;s hands. She walked out into the living room, sipping 
tea. Noticing a piece of paper on the table, Michiru walked over to it 
and picked it up. The tea turned to dust in her mouth as she read the 
note. She had to force herself to swallow, as her heart grew cold 
within her breast. She picked up the phone and dialed, her hand 
shaking. The phone rang several times and then a sleepy voice 
answered. 

&quot;Setsuna,&quot; Michiru whispered past dry lips. &quot;She&#39;s gone.&quot; </pre>
