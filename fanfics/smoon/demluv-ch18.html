  Queen Serenity began the ceremony first.
  &quot;Have both of you agreed on a specific rite of 
passage between you? Do you wish the bond 
ceremony to be recognized by the gods?&quot;
  &quot;Hai, your Highness.&quot; Both girls replied.
  &quot;Do you understand that what we ordain in this 
ceremony is eternal and cannot be undone?&quot; Queen 
Serenity went on.
  &quot;Hai, we do, your Highness.&quot; They both 
responded and held hands.
  Queen Serenity accepted their unity and 
smiled. 
  &quot;Which bond is it you both seek?&quot; She 
inquired.
  &quot;We wish to take the eternal blood bond oath, 
your Highness.&quot; Sailor Mars and Eternal Moon 
spoke as one voice.
  &quot;So be it.&quot; 
  Queen Serenity&#39;s scepter hilt dropped and 
smote the floor with a thud that echoed 
throughout the fire room.
  &quot;Take out your henshin pens.&quot; She ordered. 
  The girls complied, and faced Queen Serenity. 
  &quot;Unscrew the tops of your pens clockwise, as 
if to tighten them.&quot; Queen Serenity commanded.
  Both girls were surprised. They wondered how 
extensively Ami had examined the pens and if she 
knew about this. As the girls pulled the tops 
off, a ring they hadn&#39;t noticed before on the 
upper portion slipped off, and fell into their 
open palms.
  &quot;As you can see, there are no more rings. This 
bond can only be performed once. These rings are 
magic in nature and when placed onto the right 
ring finger of your mate, it will bond to their 
soul. It cannot be removed. Should one of you 
die, so will the other. The ring will enable you 
to find one another in the event of another 
rebirth. It is called the eternal friendship 
ring. Do you understand?&quot; 
  The girls acknowledged and nodded.
  &quot;Hai, we understand and accept this ring as a 
token of our eternal friendship to each other, 
your Highness.&quot;  
  The girls faced one another, put their henshin 
pens back together, and returned them to their 
subspace pockets.
  Sailor Mars and Eternal Moon looked deeply 
into each other&#39;s eyes, and Moon bowed 
graciously towards Mars, and encouraged her to 
speak first.
  Sailor Mars bowed back and began. 
  &quot;Eternal Moon, will you accept my ring of 
eternal friendship as a symbol of an endless 
friendship and a love for you that will 
transcend life itself?&quot;
  &quot;Hai, Sailor Mars, I will. And will you Mars, 
accept my ring of eternal friendship as my 
promise of limitless friendship and love for 
you?&quot; 
  Eternal Sailor Moon besought her companion. 
  &quot;Hai, Sailor Moon, I will.&quot; 
  Sailor Mars then held Eternal Sailor Moon&#39;s 
right hand, and gazed with bold adoration into 
the depths of the large royal blue sapphire 
eyes. 
  She took a deep breath, and slowly slipped her 
gold ring with Mars&#39; arrows etched intricately 
around it onto Sailor Moon&#39;s right ring finger.
  Eternal Moon felt a tingle in her finger and a 
temporary flush of heat in her chest. Moon 
gasped softly as she felt Mars&#39; intense, 
unspeakable Fire, and her presence within was 
magnified.
  Eternal Sailor Moon then took Sailor Mars&#39; 
right hand, and smiled winsomely. She looked 
steadily into Mars&#39; brilliant purple amethyst 
eyes, Eternal Moon let her own devotion shine 
through to Mars. Sailor Moon gently slipped her 
own gold ring etched intricately with crescent 
moons around it, onto Mars&#39; right ring finger. 
  Super Sailor Mars likewise felt a tingle in 
her finger and felt a compassionate warmth wrap 
around her inner being. She closed her eyes 
appreciatively as she felt Eternal Sailor Moon&#39;s 
presence magnified inside her, and sighed.
  Eternal Sailor Moon&#39;s lips met hers in a 
tender kiss, and Sailor Mars was lost in its 
unbelievable sweetness as she kissed Sailor Moon 
back. The kiss lasted only a few treasured 
moments, and ended unwillingly. 
  The two once again faced Queen Serenity.
  Queen Serenity observed their friendship bond 
in silence. At its conclusion, she spoke. 
  &quot;You have now been united in friendship for 
eternity, but you are not yet bonded as mates by 
blood. Do you wish to continue?&quot;
  Both answered affirmatively. 
  &quot;Hai, your Highness.&quot;
  &quot;The blood bond will unite your bodies, minds, 
and souls together eternally. Your star seeds, 
and your very beings will be forever linked. You 
will intimately know each other. Is this what 
you both desire? Are you prepared to be as 
lovers?&quot; Queen Serenity asked softly.
  &quot;Hai, and we are, your Highness.&quot; They 
responded just as softly. 
  &quot;So be it. Let us begin.&quot;
  Queen Serenity took a step back, and Artemis 
swept forward authoritatively.

                   * * *          
  Artemis unsheathed a sharp, flawless, chrome 
ceremony blade covered with ancient scribe and 
design, and pulled it out with a &#39;thhpp&#39;. It had 
a terrible kind of beauty and inspired awe in 
those who looked upon it. 
  Eternal Sailor Moon swallowed nervously while 
Super Sailor Mars&#39; face flushed with excitement.
  &quot;Face one another. Reach forth your right 
hands, your palms facing, but not touching.&quot; 
  Artemis commanded. 
  She drew the blade between their palms so that 
it would slice along their &#39;life-lines&#39;.
  &quot;Entwine your fingers together, and allow the 
blade to penetrate the skin. The words inscribed 
without are the key to the ancient magic within, 
and can only begin its work as your blood flows 
around it.&quot; 
  Mars and Moon obeyed and as their blood began 
to flow, Artemis uttered a few words in a tongue 
of the gods and quickly pulled the blade through 
the girls&#39; palms, and sliced them open so they 
bled more profusely. 
  When the blade was removed, it was handed to 
Queen Serenity to meticulously clean with a 
chamois cloth. 
  The girls meanwhile had pressed their palms 
together in an attempt to staunch the blood. 
When their palms touched and their blood 
mingled, they both felt a prickly sensation 
spread warmly through each other&#39;s veins. Their 
insides seemed to quiver, and they became 
acutely aware of each other&#39;s presence.
  Artemis spoke then. 
  &quot;What you feel now is called &#39;The Quickening&#39; 
of the blood. It will awaken the bond that will 
bind your bodies together, first. Open your 
minds to one another, as you feel the quickening 
enter your consciousness, you should be able to 
communicate telepathically. Concentrate only on 
your mate&#39;s desire... not your own desire.&quot;
  &#39;Usagi, I can feel your presence in my mind 
now, can you hear me?&#39; Rei thought to her.
  &#39;Hai, I can, my love. I can also feel your 
attraction for me. I am overwhelmed... I had no 
idea you felt so deeply.&#39; Usagi thought back.
  &#39;I, too, can feel you in the same way, my 
Angel. I can scarcely believe desire for me is 
so strong!&#39; Rei was exuberant.
  &#39;Sugoi, mental love sessions!&#39; Usagi 
exclaimed. She projected an image to Rei.
  &#39;Usagi, that&#39;s no way for a Queen to behave!&#39; 
Rei thought back in shock.
  Eternal Sailor Moon stuck her tongue out 
partially at Mars, who smiled.
  Artemis interrupted their interlude.
  &quot;Open your souls to one another by 
concentrating on one another&#39;s Ki, or aura, and 
let the quickening touch your essences.&quot;
  Both girls closed their eyes and felt for each 
other&#39;s aura and battle spirit. Slowly Eternal 
Sailor Moon&#39;s form swirled with white-pink 
energy surrounded by feathers, and rings of fire 
energy surrounded Super Sailor Mars. The two 
energies began to coalesce and burn a bright 
feathery deep pink, and enveloped the two 
within. 
  Sailor Mars and Eternal Sailor Moon embraced 
each other around the waist with their left 
arms, their right palms pressed securely 
together.
  Eternal Sailor Moon was transported into 
Sailor Mars&#39; incredible fire borne of the master 
Hephaestus whose very workshops were volcanoes. 
Sailor Moon could feel Hephaestus&#39; endowment of 
manual dexterity, his weapons wizardry, and 
Sailor Moon felt herself drawn to his charms. 
Sailor Moon could feel the raw passion and power 
of the warrior-huntress Artemis. She felt the 
tightly controlled magnitude of magic and 
sorcery instilled in Mars from Arch Mage Hecate. 
Mars had awesome untapped powers! Moon was a 
part of everything that was Mars, and she loved 
her deeply. 
  Mars, in turn, experienced the overwhelming 
power of the ginsuishou and its intimacy with 
Moon, and understood for the first time how it 
was part of her being. She felt Eternal Sailor 
Moon&#39;s formidable strength of character. She 
felt Selene&#39;s unnerving will, compassion, moral 
discernment, and her light and love. From Apollo 
came the spirit of a warrior, a healer, a 
musician, and a spirit of truthfulness, 
prescience, and his light and love. Mars was a 
part of everything that was Moon, who embodied 
the will of love and was light personified. Mars 
loved her deeply, with all of who she was.
  Then they &#39;knew&#39; each other. As the two locked 
their lips in a passionate kiss, the quickening 
culminated in a pleasure-effect like nothing 
Mars had ever experienced before, and Moon only 
vaguely. The quickening dissipated, and left the 
girls on their knees. 
  They were dressed once more in their 
nightwear. There was no trace of their eternal 
friendship rings, or the deep cut on their 
palms. Their &#39;lifelines&#39; were now identical, and 
for now, it was the only visible indication that 
anything had ever taken place.
  Rei recovered first. 
  &quot;Usagi, what on Earth was that last thing that 
happened to us??&quot;
  Usagi replied breathlessly.
  &quot;Umm... that was probably the hardest orgasmic 
feeling you&#39;ll ever experience, Rei!&quot; 
  Then she became acutely aware they were not 
alone, and blushed deeply.
  Queen Sereniy put a palm to her forehead and 
Artemis shook her head, both rolled their eyes. 
Artemis pointed at a mortified Usagi and spoke 
to Serenity accusingly. 
  &quot;That is definitely my brother Apollo&#39;s child, 
Selene! Should we leave them alone to consummate 
their relationship now?&quot;
  &quot;I don&#39;t know, is it safe? Are we done with 
them?&quot; Serenity asked. 
  Then she turned to Usagi and Rei with an 
expression of mirth. 
  &quot;Do either of you have any questions?&quot; 
  The girls stood hand in hand as one.
  &quot;Hai, your Highness,&quot; Rei began, &quot;why did our 
rings disappear, and will we ever see them 
again? And what was that we felt at the end?&quot; 
  Artemis answered her daughter. 
  &quot;As I mentioned before, the rings were magical 
in nature. They would attract the same attention 
as the ginsuishou does. Your enemies must never 
know of your connection to each other, or it can 
be used against you. So, no, you will never see 
them again, but you will feel them there. 
Remember, if one of you dies, so does your mate. 
  For your protection, you have been given a way 
to warn each other telepathically of danger. You 
will also be able to feel when each other is in 
trouble. 
  On the last question, what you felt was a 
direct result of the extent of the, ahem, 
passion you share for one another, and how well 
your souls have been bonded together. So, in a 
sense, Serenity is correct.&quot; Artemis smiled, 
then, at Usagi.
  &quot;The blood bond oath is also a rite of 
passage. You have left your youth behind you, 
and oftentimes, your maidenhood will follow. It 
is a celebration of womanhood. 
  My daughter Diana is now your responsibility, 
Serenity, guard her well, and love her. I have 
not been a mother to her, and know nothing of 
her, regretfully, to help you understand her. 
Arch Mage Hecate and Hephaestus raised her. She 
is also Ares&#39;... champion.&quot; 
  Artemis made a small face, she clearly 
disliked the war-some troublemaker. 
  &quot;All of us will help you in spirit when you 
need it. Just come here to the sacred fire of 
Mars to commune with us.&quot; 
  Artemis leaned forward and kissed Usagi, then 
embraced Rei. 
  &quot;Be good to her, Diana, or I&#39;ll exercise my 
right as a parent and punish you! Protect her 
and love her with all your might.&quot; 
  She kissed Rei, and stepped away for the 
Goddess Selene to have a last word.
  Selene laughed at her lunar sister, daughter 
of Leto and Zeus. Artemis stuck her tongue out 
at her!!
  Usagi and Rei giggled.
  &quot;Ahem!&quot; Selene began. 
  &quot;Serenity, you now belong to Diana. She is 
your mate for eternity, you are to protect her, 
care for her and love her more than yourself, 
even when you don&#39;t feel like it. This bond is 
an eternal commitment of unconditional love, 
there is no &#39;I&#39; in the word love! You do not 
walk away from a vow. You will try whatever it 
takes to keep Diana content and satisfied with 
you.&quot; 
  Selene turned to Rei then, and Rei trembled. 
In some respects, Usagi&#39;s mother was more 
fearsome than her own mother. She fought the 
urge to prostrate herself, and swallowed in 
trepidation.
  &quot;Diana, my beloved daughter is now a woman, 
your mate, and your responsibility. I trust you, 
Diana, to protect her as I have, and her Earth 
mother Ikuko has, whom I carefully selected 
personally to be her mother. Serenity has 
special needs, and I expect you to make sure 
they are met. 
  &quot;It is very important for her energy level to 
be maintained at all times. Mercury&#39;s computer 
has documented Queen Serenity&#39;s dietary trial 
and errors, and also the illnesses. You may find 
it helpful. 
  Serenity will be the hardest job you will ever 
face, but also the most loving and rewarding 
one. With your bond in place, you will be able 
to feel each other&#39;s stress level. You are both 
uniquely suited for each other&#39;s stress 
relief... that&#39;s why you are soul mates. I also 
expect you to obey your vows to her throughout 
your ring exchange. You will love her more than 
yourself, or your own life. She is your life 
now, and you are hers.&quot;
  Selene stepped towards Rei and welcomed her 
new daughter into a warm embrace and tender kiss 
planted upon Mars&#39; arrow spot. She spoke 
caringly.
  &quot;I love you, Diana. You&#39;ve always held a 
special place in my heart. I hope you can 
forgive me for my intrusion on yours and the 
Princess Serenity&#39;s relationship during my reign 
as queen. At the time it was necessary. All of 
us have to obey someone else&#39;s command in the 
name of destiny... ask Pluto. Ask Serenity. 
  My daughter has been groomed for her destiny 
for two lifetimes, and you are now her 
lifeline... she will look to you, most of all, 
to be her pillar of strength and to get her 
through tough times. I have great confidence 
that my daughter is in good hands with you.&quot;
  Selene looked at them both for a moment. 
  &quot;I am the Moon personified. I shall be known 
now by my rightful name of Goddess Selene. Of 
all  the duties I&#39;ve ever had, the creation of 
the Silver Millennium has given me the most 
pleasure. My special job as Queen Serenity and 
her motherhood to Princess Serenity has ended, 
now, and I will go now to take my place among 
the gods... in the Elysian Fields.
  You are the true Serenity, Usagi. In a few 
years, you will ascend to rule as queen in your 
own right, and complete my reign of the Silver 
Millennium. It is your destiny to rebuild the 
bridge and close the gap between the mundane of 
man, and the magic of the Gods. You are now our 
representative for the gods, and in the 
fullness of time, the ginsuishou will help you 
fulfill your true destiny. 
  The ginsuishou was forged by Hephaestus, with 
key inputs from all the principal gods, but 
mostly from those who govern this solar system&#39;s 
planets, moons, and sun... Gaea included. It 
allows you to tap into, and control, all of this 
solar system&#39;s power, except Earths. It is held 
together by our collective magic... especially 
by the Arch Mage Hecate. It was she who selected 
me to wield it because of my intrinsic goodwill 
and fairness. 
  Serenity, you have been most successful in the 
control of its power, and indeed have surpassed 
even me. You are its rightful owner. As my 
daughter, you are the Goddess Serenity. You 
naturally possess my powers, and you are the 
Moon&#39;s avatar. The ginsuishou&#39;s awesome power is 
harnessed only by the power of your love and 
will. You have everything you need to have a 
successful campaign.
  Guard the ginsuishou well from your enemies 
who would seek to destroy you and your purpose. 
You will have many enemies; those who ignorantly 
desire the crystal&#39;s power, and those who desire 
to make sure the gap between us and mankind is 
never bridged... a holy war of sorts. Your 
Silver Millennium must not fail, as mine did, 
precious. You are our last hope.&quot; 
  Selene took notice of the girls&#39; confusion and 
sadness. She embraced, and kissed both her loved 
ones&#39; cheeks tenderly. 
  &quot;Queen Serenity gave her life for all of you 
in order to preserve the god&#39;s master plan.&quot; 
  Then she turned to Usagi directly, and put her 
hands on her daughter&#39;s shoulders.  
  &quot;Goddess Selene, can not die, beloved. You 
will always be Selene and Apollo&#39;s daughter, 
Serenity.&quot; 
  She smiled then, and the two goddesses began 
to fade from view, but they could still hear 
the argument that ensued between the Goddesses. 
  &quot;Selene, that was not the ceremonial chamois!&quot; 
Artemis growled.
  &quot;Picky, picky! Your ceremonial chamois was not 
not in your box. You&#39;re lucky I found this 
one... next time you can use the hem of your 
robe. Ares probably borrowed your bloody rag to 
polish his boots again.&quot;
  Artemis grew fangs.
  &quot;Tartarus is too good for him!
  Listen Selene, I need to get my mind off of 
things, and unwind. Athena and I found a cozy 
little massage parlor in Delphi that has special 
rooms, are you interested?&quot; 
  There was a pause. 
  &quot;Celeste is my one and only. I thought you 
were sworn to celibacy.&quot;
  Artemis rolled her eyes.
  &quot;Get a clue! I&#39;m not sexually dead, I&#39;ve only 
abstained from men... &quot; Silence.
  They left behind a couple of blushing, pensive 
girls.
