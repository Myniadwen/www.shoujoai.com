<a href="../smoon/returnsailorv-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>THE SLUMBER PARTY 

&quot;Our top story this evening is of course the appearance of Sailor Moon.&quot; 

The anchorman read the top of the 11:00 news as Sailor Mars and Sailor Venus, both still in 
full uniform (gloves, shoes and tiaras included) sat on the couch. Mina had her head on 
Raye&#39;s shoulder. They both held each other&#39;s hands. 

&quot;Sailor V has been reported working with the NYPD the past week, she is now nowhere to be 
found. Experts are wondering if a member of Sailor Moon&#39;s team is actually the masked 
Sailor V.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah it&#39;s me!&quot; Jupiter laughed from the kitchen. She too was still in full uniform having 
a late-snack. Mina laughed and Raye shook her head in amusement. 

&quot;Sailor Moon and her Sailor Scouts helped take down the notorious heroin-dealer known as 
Sollozzo. He had gathered a mob together by Ground Zero in an attempt to assassinate Sailor 
Moon and her four Sailor Scouts. Police apprehended the scene arresting 130 criminals, some 
of which have been on New York&#39;s top ten most wanted list. New York Police sergeant 
Sebastian Dante was responsible for terminating the criminal along with his partner 
sergeant Paul Sirico. Dante had a press statement this afternoon.&quot; 

The screen turned to Dante and Sirico standing outside the police station. Dante read a 
statement about what had happened: 

&quot;I was forced to shoot Sollozzo on the spot. The man was responsible for shooting Sailor 
Moon, I am very happy to say she is doing fine. Sergeant Sirico, myself, and the city of 
New York are grateful to the Sailor Scouts for helping us take down this dangerous man 
along with bringing many of the city&#39;s criminals into custody. After years of chasing this 
man, the streets of New York City are much safer without Sollozzo.&quot; 

&quot;YEAH!&quot; Sirico interrupted in a child-like manner looking directly into the camera, &quot;Go 
Sailor Scouts!&quot; 

Dante paused and gave Sirico an annoyed look. Sirico looked guilty. Dante turned back to 
the cameras with anger in his voice, &quot;I would also like to request a new partner-&quot; 

The scene was interrupted switching back to the news anchorman, &quot;The mayor will be 
rewarding Sergeant Dante by promoting him to Captain of his precinct. Sergeant Sirico will 
become a Lieutenant.&quot; 

&quot;Way to go guys!&quot; Mina shouted at the TV. 

&quot;Sailor Moon and her Sailor Scouts are expected to be honored by the Mayor. Sailor V was 
supposed to receive the NYPD Medal of Valor. However, because of Sailor V&#39;s disappearance, 
and upon Captain Dante&#39;s recommendation, Sailor Venus will be receiving this award instead. 
Once again experts are insisting that Sailor V is Sailor Venus, but Lieutenant Sirico 
insisted this is not the case:&quot; 

Back to Sirico and Dante, Dante spoke: 

&quot;We have no comment about that at this time-&quot; 

Sirico immediately interrupted: &quot;That&#39;s ridiculous! Sailor V is not Sailor Venus. Sailor V 
wears glasses! Sailor Venus doesn&#39;t!&quot; 

Dante brought his hand to his forehead. 

&quot;She&#39;d just take them off when she&#39;s Sailor Venus?&quot; A reported asked. 

&quot;Well that doesn&#39;t make any sense,&quot; Sirico said, &quot;How would she be able to see?&quot; 

Sailor Mars turned to her girlfriend, &quot;You feeling better?&quot; 

Venus turned to see the raven-hair. The blonde smiled, &quot;Yeah.&quot; 

Sailor Mars leaned into kiss her blonde girlfriend. Mina put her hands on Raye&#39;s face 
closing her eyes as their lips softly pressed against each other. 
 
 

Sailor Moon&#39;s room was pitch black. She, in full uniform, lied on the king-sized bed face 
down, her gloved hands underneath the pillow, the side of her head on top. She lied over 
the covers. Her eyes were wide open as she stared at the shaded window. Her eyes were 
filled with uncertainty. The events of what had happened over the past week, especially 
today, were still sinking in. Every once in a while, she closed her eyes and felt small 
shocks of pain in her chest. A knock came through the door. A blue-haired Sailor Soldier 
brought light into the dark room. Like all of them, Sailor Mercury was in full uniform. 
Apparently, it didn&#39;t dawn on any of them to change back into their civilian uniforms. Or 
perhaps they were prepared just in case any other criminals tried to come after them. 
Serena lifted her head towards the door to see her friend. 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Amy said as she came through the door. She left it open. 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Serena smiled, brought her hands out from under the pillow and turned to her back. 

Amy lied down on the bed facing her girlfriend. They were taciturn. Amy lifted Serena&#39;s 
gloved fingers and softly ran her own fingers across them. Serena circled her thumb around 
Amy&#39;s. Both of them chuckled. 

&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Mercury asked. 

Serena sighed, &quot;I&#39;m fine. Only hurts once in a while.&quot; 

Mercury sat up and grabbed a hold of the blonde&#39;s skirt. &quot;Can I see?&quot; 

Serena nodded and sat up. Mercury pulled up the uniform from Sailor Moon&#39;s blue skirt. The 
skirt was attached to the leotard. Serena lifted her arms. As the leotard slowly rolled 
off, a large bandaged appeared near the top of the girl&#39;s diaphragm. Her breasts revealed 
themselves and the uniform came off; Sailor Moon&#39;s long odango hair slipping out of the 
discarded collar of the shirt. 

&quot;Lie back,&quot; Mercury said. 

Sailor Moon did as her lover wished. As her body lied to the ground, Mercury softly brought 
her gloved fingertips to the wounded girl&#39;s lower chest. Serena chuckled slightly almost as 
if she was being tickled. 

&quot;I&#39;ve never really noticed how cold your fingertips are,&quot; Serena said. 

&quot;Why do think I wear gloves,&quot; Mercury smiled. She could feel Sailor Moon&#39;s flesh not just 
through her fingertips, but through the bandage as well. What was a horrible gaping wound 
earlier in the operating room almost now felt like a simple scar. Her cold hands actually 
brought warmth and relief to the Princess&#39; body. 

She began to sigh, &quot;I was scared today Amy. I though this might have been the end for me.&quot; 

Amy&#39;s face became very grave as she continued to rub her chest, &quot;I don&#39;t think you were as 
scared as I was Serena. I thought I might lose you. To lose you after having been 
separated,&quot; She hesitated, &quot;I meant what I said back there. I will never leave you again 
Sailor Moon.&quot; 

Amy&#39;s hands moved up towards Serena&#39;s breasts. She sat on top of her pelvis. Serena&#39;s eyes 
stared into Amy&#39;s, &quot;Sailor A&#39;s going to keep fighting crime in this city.&quot; Sailor Moon said 
inching her lips ever much closer to Amy&#39;s, &quot;But Sailor M is going to fight with her.&quot; 

&quot;I look forward to it,&quot; Amy said and the two embraced in a deep kiss. Mercury lied on top 
of her girlfriend, though careful not to press against her chest. 

Two silhouettes appeared through the light of the door. Mercury and Moon broke their kiss 
to see Mars and Jupiter standing in the doorway. 

&quot;Oh sorry guys,&quot; Raye said, &quot;I just wanted to make sure you were okay Serena.&quot; 

Serena laughed, &quot;Oh, does that mean you actually care about me Raye?&quot; 

Mars rolled her eyes. 

&quot;Admit it Raye,&quot; Serena teased, &quot;You were worried about me.&quot; 

&quot;You should have seen her crying in the waiting room,&quot; Lita said as she sat onto the other 
side of the bed. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t cry!&quot; Raye complained and hesitated, &quot;All right maybe a little.&quot; 

Lita rubbed her gloved hand across Sailor Moon&#39;s chest, &quot;Amy making you feel better?&quot; 

&quot;Of course she is,&quot; Sailor Moon turned to her blue-haired girlfriend. 

&quot;Listen,&quot; Sailor Jupiter said, &quot;You don&#39;t mind if we join you?&quot; 

&quot;Oh please,&quot; Serena motioned for her to lie on the large bed with her. 

Lita reached her head across Sailor Moon for Amy, &quot;You got a hell of a girlfriend saving 
your life like that.&quot; Lita gave Amy a peck on the lips. Raye laid down on the edge of the 
bed and stared up at the ceiling. 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Serena said playfully, &quot;Get your own girlfriend.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t have anybody,&quot; Lita said, &quot;There&#39;s an odd number of Scouts in this apartment.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m just kidding Lita,&quot; Serena laughed, &quot;Of course you&#39;re always welcome to join us.&quot; 

&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; Mercury said, &quot;Where&#39;s Sailor-&quot; 

A knock on the door interrupted Mercury&#39;s words. It was Sailor Venus standing alone 
silhouetted by the light in the doorway. &quot;Can I come in?&quot; 

All of the scouts looked at her in a playful way. &quot;What the password?&quot; Serena said as she 
folded her arms. 

Mina help up a wrapped chocolate bar, &quot;Ice-Cream?&quot; 

&quot;Yay!&quot; Serena sat up and clapped her hands like a little girl. Mina handed Sailor Moon the 
bar of cream and sugar. 

&quot;Come over here Mina,&quot; Raye patted the edge of the bed. Mina climbed onto the edge of the 
bed and held onto her black-haired girlfriend. 

&quot;Oh boy,&quot; Serena said with a chocolate covered face, &quot;We&#39;re having a slumber party.&quot; 

Raye sighed and rolled her eyes, &quot;Serena&#39;s still 13. She never grew up.&quot; 

Serena frowned at Sailor Mars with ice-cream in her mouth, &quot;You are so mean Raye! I got 
back from the hospital and I never got that ice-cream you promised me.&quot; 

&quot;I didn&#39;t promise it to you,&quot; Raye chuckled and pointed to Mina, &quot;She did!&quot; 

&quot;By the way Amy,&quot; Mina said as she looked over at the bluenette. Mina was sounding like her 
old happy self-again, &quot;Didn&#39;t you promise Sailor Moon something as well?&quot; 

There was silence as all eyes fell on Amy. She raised her eyebrows. 

&quot;Well,&quot; Serena said finishing up her chocolate bar, &quot;Amy and I were having an intimate 
moment,&quot; Serena hesitated and brought her ice-cream bar up to Amy&#39;s face. Amy took a very 
slow lick of the bar with her tongue. Serena turned back to her friends, &quot;Until you guys 
all showed up.&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; Sailor Venus said, &quot;Maybe we can all share Amy with you tonight.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t you want to be with Raye tonight?&quot; Serena asked. 

&quot;Of course I do,&quot; Mina rubbed Raye&#39;s boobs from outside her shirt, &quot;But I haven&#39;t seen you 
or Lita in a while either.&quot; 

&quot;Fuck the slumber-party,&quot; Lita said, &quot;We&#39;re gonna have an orgy party tonight.&quot; 

All the girls laughed at the idea except for Amy. 

&quot;Wait guys,&quot; Mercury said, &quot;Sailor Moon is still recovering, maybe we should take it easy 
tonight.&quot; 

Mina, Raye, and Lita all nodded their heads. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Lita said. 

&quot;No no no no no!&quot; Sailor Moon said, &quot;You promised me Amy. You&#39;re not the kind of girl who 
goes back on a promise.&quot; She pulled her girlfriend forward and began to reach under her 
shirt. Amy closed her eyes and sighed. The two ended up making out and stripping with each 
other. The pain in Sailor Moon&#39;s chest had practically evaporated. 

Mars pined Venus down to the ground. She had a dominatrix look on her face, &quot;All right 
Sailor V!&quot; She growled, &quot;You left the Sailor Scouts.&quot; She grabbed the blonde&#39;s face and 
smiled evil-like. &quot;And now, in the name of Mars, I will punish you!&quot; Raye bit Mina&#39;s lip 
and ran her legs and arms all across the blonde&#39;s body. Mina moaned in bliss at Raye&#39;s 
dominating attitude. 

Sailor Jupiter sat on the bed. She looked to her left; Sailor Moon and Mercury were kissing 
each other ever so softly. She looked to her right; Sailor Mars and Venus were going at 
each other like wild animals. She looked forward and sighed. Her sadness was suddenly 
interrupted as she felt something squeezing her pelvis. She looked down to see two hands 
reaching for her: One belonging to Sailor Moon, the other belonging to Sailor Venus. 

It was going to be a long night of reunion and pleasure. 



- EPILOGUE -
 

The jewelry store on 7th avenue was a sight of horror as two man dressed in all-black 
pointed their guns at the poor elderly woman behind the counter. She put all the money in 
the register and several pieces of jewelry into the bag. The other guy had already cleared 
out everything else in the store. The two men laughed as she finished putting everything in 
the bag. The theif before the counter tightened up his bag and turned around. He suddenly 
stopped and dropped the bag. His partner turned around and froze as well. 

Standing before both of them were the five Sailor Scouts.
