Minako tried one last time to convince Rei, but the latter would 
not be deterred.  &quot;Mina-chan, I eat room service all the time.  I 
travel almost as much as you do and I know you&#39;re as sick of it 
as I am.  I want to go out to a nice restaurant.&quot;

&quot;But Rei-chan, it&#39;s not that easy,&quot; Minako tried to explain.

&quot;I know that you&#39;re famous, but we&#39;re not even in Japan and we&#39;re 
just going to the place around the corner.  I can survive a few 
interruptions.&quot;  Rei pulled the reluctant Mina to her feet and 
helped her put her jacket on.  &quot;Now let&#39;s go.  I&#39;m starved!&quot;

After her professional debut (well, she hadn&#39;t been paid, but..), 
Rei had accompanied Minako back to her suite of rooms at the 
hotel.  Mina had insisted that Rei share her suite and Rei hadn&#39;t 
argued the point very much.  The whole purpose of her trip was to 
spend time with her friend after all.  Still, the exertions of 
her long trip and then performing on stage had taken their toll.  
Both of them just about collapsed into sleep as soon as they got 
back and both slept in very late the next morning.  After a 
leisurely brunch, they had spent the afternoon simply chatting 
together in the lounge between their bedrooms.  

At one point, Mina&#39;s agent had arrived with forms for Rei.  She 
signed them with no fuss, trusting Mina not to take advantage of 
her.  In reality, Mina had insisted that Rei receive twice the 
standard amount of royalties due to a songwriter.  Rei had no 
interest in the money, of course.   She was still stunned and 
excited that Mina wanted to record her song.  

After spending the day cooped up, however, Rei had decided that 
she wanted to get out of the room, and so they found themselves 
on the way down to the lobby.  As soon as the elevator doors 
opened, Rei realized that perhaps she should have listened to 
Mina.

&quot;There she is!&quot; one of the throng of teenage girls screeched.  
&quot;Mina! Mina!  Please, sign my book!&quot;  The other girls took up the 
call and began crowding forward.  Though she was a petite woman, 
Rei managed to carve a path for the two of them through the 
crowd, even as Mina signed everything thrust in front of her.  

&quot;We love you, Mina!&quot;  &quot;You&#39;re the best, Minako!&quot; 

Mina waved and smiled, but let Rei lead her out of there.  Once 
out on the street, they took off at a dead run, turning down an 
alley and doing their best to avoid the crowd.  After some twists 
and turns, they emerged on the other side of the block, across 
from the restaurant.  

The peace and quiet their flight had gained them lasted 
approximately 13 minutes.  Someone as visible as Aino Minako was 
given a table immediately at the restaurant, but just as they 
were placing their orders, the interruptions started.   First, it 
was a young couple on a first date who wanted a photo with the 
young idol.   Next was an elderly couple whose granddaughter was 
Mina&#39;s &#39;biggest fan.&#39;  Mina and Rei couldn&#39;t even start a normal 
conversation and Mina could tell that Rei was beginning to lose 
her temper.

&quot;I told you so,&quot; she teased after signing yet another autograph, 
this time for the busboy who was filling their water glasses.  
&quot;Fortunately, I&#39;ve figured out a solution.  Wait here.&quot;

Rei watched Mina head toward the back of the restaurant.  &#39;If she 
sneaks out on me, I will track her down and kill her,&#39; Rei 
thought.  Though the constant interruptions were irksome, Rei was 
more upset that she&#39;d been wrong, that she hadn&#39;t listened to her 
friend in the first place.  She should have known that Mina would 
know better what would happen, but she had been looking forward 
to having a nice dinner with her for the longest time.  

&quot;Excuse me, is this seat taken?&quot; 

Rei looked up and gasped.  Standing over Mina&#39;s empty seat was 
the most beautiful man she had ever seen in her life.  Though 
she&#39;d realized long ago that her preferences lay in a different 
direction, she still appreciated a good-looking man and this one 
was beyond compare.  Tall, thin, impeccably dressed, short blonde 
hair, and deep blue eyes, he was like an Adonis.  No matter how 
beautiful (not handsome, she noted, but beautiful) this guy was 
though, Rei had only one thing on her mind tonight, spending time 
with Aino Minako.  

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m waiting...&quot; 

As she got ready to turn the man away, she found herself gazing 
deeply into his eyes.  They sparkled with a hidden mischief and 
something more, as if he knew her better than she knew herself.  
And then, she understood.

&quot;Please, have a seat,&quot; she announced a little more loudly than 
necessary.  &quot;My friend seems to have abandoned me for the 
evening.&quot;

&quot;You mean the famous Minako?  Not very gallant of her to abandon 
such a gorgeous dinner companion,&quot; the man said as he sat down.

&quot;You flatter me, sir.  My name is Hino Rei and you are?&quot;  

&quot;I know your name,&quot; he replied with a dangerous smile.  He failed 
to respond to her question, instead reaching forward to take one 
hand in his.  &quot;I know everything about you, Hino Rei.&quot;

&quot;Do you now?&quot; Rei replied coquettishly, playing an unfamiliar 
role.  Usually, she was the aggressor, but it was nice to let 
someone else take the lead for once, especially this particular 
individual.

The man nodded, stroking her hand with his thumb. &quot;Ms. Aino is a 
fool to have left you here all alone, but her loss is my gain.&quot;

&quot;Mina is nobody&#39;s fool,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;She is the most 
incredible woman in the world and my very best friend.&quot;	

Blushing, he asked, &quot;Is that all she is to you?  A friend?&quot;

Feeling it was time to exert a little bit of control on the 
situation, Rei subtly slipped her foot out of her high heeled 
shoe.  Delicately, she slid her nylon-covered toe along her 
companion&#39;s foot and up his pant leg.  &quot;That remains to be seen,&quot; 
she answered, watching with delight as he gulped and squirmed 
suddenly.

He leaned forward and Rei did likewise so that their foreheads 
were practically touching.  &quot;Then I would say that Aino Minako is 
the luckiest woman in the world,&quot; he informed her.  His eyes 
smouldered as they held Rei&#39;s and his fingers traced patterns on 
the back of her hand.  

Breathing deeply, Rei withdrew her wandering toe and shifted back 
a bit.  &quot;I should have known not to try to best the goddess of 
love and beauty,&quot; she sighed heavily, her heart beating almost 
audibly.

Minako also sat back in her chair, still holding Rei&#39;s hand.  She 
laughed happily.  &quot;When did you figure it out?&quot;

&quot;When I looked into your eyes,&quot; Rei told her in a soft, serious 
voice.  Blood rushed to Minako&#39;s cheeks.  &quot;So, how did you 
convince Usagi to give you the transformation pen?&quot;

&quot;Luna gave it to me actually.  She had confiscated it from Usagi 
a long time ago and almost forgotten about it.  I got tired of 
not being to go out in public any more and she sympathized.&quot; 

Rei flashed a teasing grin at her companion.  &quot;So, used it for 
anything...interesting?  Oh, I&#39;m sorry, is it getting warm in 
here?  You seem to perspiring all of a sudden.&quot;

&quot;Touche,&quot; Mina replied, raising her glass to Rei.  

Rei responded by lifting her own and clinking it against Mina&#39;s.  
&quot;To friendship, and that which remains to be seen.&quot;

Mina emptied her glass in one shot, wondering if it was the wine 
that was making her so light-headed. With a sudden, glorious 
certainty, she knew it was not.

-----------------

Makoto stirred, confused for a moment or two as to where exactly 
she was.  Looking around, she realized she must be in Ami&#39;s 
bedroom.  Slowly, her brain rebooted and she remembered Ami 
putting her to bed.  Her fingers grazed the hair on the top of 
her head, where she imagined she could still feel the moisture of 
Ami&#39;s kiss.  &#39;Probably just sweat and bed head,&#39; she decided 
ruefully.  Slowly, she slid out of the covers and took a closer 
look at her surroundings.   Ami&#39;s room was much as she&#39;d 
described it in her emails: mostly functional, with full 
bookshelves everywhere, along with a second-hand dresser and 
nightstand.   Mako noticed a number of picture frames on the 
dresser and moved to examine them.  A few showed Ami with people 
who must have been her American friends, but most were of their 
friends from Tokyo.   There was Mamoru and Usagi&#39;s wedding photo, 
a copy of which sat on Makoto&#39;s own dresser back in France; a 
picture of the five of them that Hotaru had taken; one of Hotaru 
herself along with Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna as well.  The 
rest, however, were all of Makoto, or Makoto and Ami.  Mako 
smiled, realizing that her own room was pretty much the same, 
though all of her books were cookbooks or gardening manuals.

Running her hand through her tangled hair, she headed out into 
the living room.  &quot;Ami-chan, are you here?&quot; she called.

&quot;You&#39;re awake,&quot; Ami exclaimed happily, ducking her head out of 
the kitchen.  &quot;And right on time, too.  I&#39;ve made us dinner.  I&#39;m 
sure it won&#39;t be anywhere as good as what you used to make for 
us, but I hope you like it.&quot;

&quot;You cooked for me?&quot; Mako asked as she joined Ami in the kitchen.

&quot;Nothing too complicated,&quot; Ami admitted. &quot;Some American 
&#39;delicacies&#39; I thought you&#39;d like:  fried chicken and macaroni 
and cheese.&quot;  

Makoto laughed and took a seat at the small table in the kitchen.  
&quot;It sounds perfect, Ami-chan.  I&#39;m really hungry!&quot;  She ran her 
hand through her hair again, snarling as she hit a particularly 
nasty tangle.  

&quot;There, we just have to wait for those noodles to cook through,&quot; 
Ami announced.  Noting Makoto&#39;s struggles with her hair, she 
added, &quot;Follow me!&quot;  

Makoto trailed Ami back to the living room and sat down on the 
sofa as her hostess directed.  Ami disappeared into the bedroom 
and returned a moment later with a large brush and a spray 
bottle.  &quot;Ami-chan, you don&#39;t have to...&quot;

&quot;Hush now, Mako-chan.  Just relax,&quot; Ami admonished her.  She 
grabbed a chair pulled it over behind the sofa.  &quot;Lean your head 
back, please.&quot;   As Mako-chan complied, Ami began gently brushing 
her hair out, taking care not to tug too hard at it. 

Makoto fought the urge to fall back asleep, but it was difficult.  
She felt completely safe and secure.  In fact, upon reflection, 
she couldn&#39;t remember the last time she had been this at peace.  

&quot;There, that&#39;s better.&quot;  Ami stood up and moved back toward the 
kitchen.  &quot;Now, go get washed up.  Everything should be ready in 
a few minutes.&quot;   Waving off Makoto&#39;s thanks, she went back to 
work preparing dinner.   Just as her friend returned to sit in 
the dining room, Ami was placing the last of the dishes out.  

&quot;It smells great, Ami-chan!  Of course, I could eat a horse right 
about now.   The food on the airplane was terrible!&quot; 

&quot;Well, I hope you enjoy it,&quot; Ami said as she took her own seat.  
She paused for a moment, enjoying the sight of Makoto tearing 
into her meal.  Though she still ate sandwiches predominantly, 
Ami could see the joy that came from cooking.

Sometime later, a satiated Makoto pushed her chair back from the 
table.  &quot;That was great, thank you.&quot;  

Ami smiled and moved to clear the table.  With Makoto&#39;s help, it 
was only a few minutes before they had settled back in the living 
room.  Sitting together at opposite ends of the couch, Ami asked, 
&quot;So, what would you like to do?  Some of the girls from the club 
are going to the movies later.  We could join them if you like.&quot;

&quot;Is that your B-GLAD club?&quot; Makoto asked uncertainly.  She still 
couldn&#39;t quite fathom how her little Ami-chan had found the nerve 
to join a public organization for gays, bisexuals, and lesbians.  

Ami lowered her eyes and blushed slightly.  &quot;Yes.  Elizabeth and 
her girlfriend will be there, so it&#39;s not like you won&#39;t know 
anyone.&quot;  

Makoto frowned, &quot;If you really want to, we could, but I think I&#39;d 
rather just stay here and talk, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;  Makoto 
couldn&#39;t imagine going out in public, pretending everything was 
normal when so much needed to be said.  

Ami gave no sign that she sensed Makoto&#39;s agitation.  Instead, 
she simply nodded her head agreeably.  &quot;That would be nice, Mako-
chan.&quot;

&quot;So, I guess Elizabeth got over you, huh?&quot;

Ami paused.  After some soul-searching she had decided to tell 
Makoto about her &#39;encounter&#39; with Elizabeth.  That was part of a 
larger decision on her part, to share all of her life with 
Makoto.  She didn&#39;t want to have any secrets from the person she 
considered her best friend, and so much more.  &#39;I shouldn&#39;t be 
surprised,&#39; Ami thought.  Makoto had never been one to beat 
around the bush and clearly she wanted to get right to the matter 
at hand.  &quot;We&#39;re just friends now, Mako-chan.&quot;

&quot;You never really told me why you turned her down,&quot; Makoto 
pointed out carefully.  She thought she knew why, but she also 
knew that this was one way to get the conversation where it 
needed to be.  

&quot;You know why I turned her down, Mako-chan,&quot; Ami replied, a 
challenge in her voice.  This time, she kept her eyes riveted on 
her friend&#39;s, though she couldn&#39;t control her blushing.  

Makoto flinched from the force of Ami&#39;s gaze and tried to gather 
her thoughts.  Wasn&#39;t this why she was here?  Isn&#39;t this what 
she&#39;d been longing for, ever since she&#39;d left Tokyo?  
Unfortunately, it was also what she&#39;d been running away from 
since high school and years of habit were hard to break.  Her 
voice caught in her throat as she replied.  &quot;But why, Ami-chan?  
Why me?  What have I done to deserve this kind of loyalty, this 
devotion?  Surely, you could have found someone more deserving by 
now.&quot;

Ami scooted closer to her on the sofa and placed a hand on her 
shoulder.  &quot;More deserving?&quot; she asked incredulously.  She could 
hear her own voice breaking as the tears welled up in her eyes.  
&quot;You ask me why I love you?  Why do I eat, why do I breathe, why 
do I sleep?  You&#39;re a part of me and you always will be.&quot;  

Ami sighed deeply and closed her eyes.  &quot;This is not some junior 
high crush.  You&#39;re my best friend and have been almost as long 
as I&#39;ve even had friends.  Before I met you, I never knew what it 
was like to have someone you could share anything with, someone 
you could open your heart to, someone you could tell about your 
hopes, your dreams, your fears.  We&#39;ve fought side by side, saved 
each other&#39;s lives countless times. Well, mainly you saved mine.&quot;  

Makoto tried to protest the last statement, but Ami opened her 
eyes and squeezed her arm to silence her.  &quot;You&#39;re the sweetest, 
most loving woman I know and you bring out the best in me.  
You make me a better person just for being with you and when I&#39;m 
not with you, it&#39;s like there is a void eating away at my heart.&quot;  

Ami&#39;s dreamy expression became slightly steamier as she leaned 
closer.  For so many years, she&#39;d pent up these thoughts.  Now, 
they flowed from her like a waterfall over a cliff. &quot;All of that, 
and you&#39;re also the most beautiful woman I&#39;ve ever seen.  You 
have no idea how beautiful you are, and that only makes you that 
much more irresistible.  Do you have any idea how hard it used to 
be not to watch you constantly, to try to pay attention to 
anything anyone else was saying when you were in the room?&quot;
 
&quot;Nothing has changed,&quot; Ami concluded.  &quot;If anything, my feelings 
for you are even stronger now.  But, I can wait till you&#39;re 
ready.  I will wait forever if I must.  Right or wrong, I 
realized a long time ago that there could never be anyone else 
for me.  If you choose someone else, and they make you happy, 
then I&#39;ll rejoice in your happiness, but I could never love 
another the way I love you.&quot;  

In that moment, seeing the love in Ami&#39;s heart and her implacable 
resolve to wait as long as necessary, Makoto felt shamed. She was 
supposed to be the strong one; it was her job to protect Sailor 
Mercury.  How could she continue to put this kind, adorable, 
loving young woman through this kind of pain simply because she 
was afraid of the unknown.  

Suddenly she understood.  Ami&#39;s love for her was important, yes, 
but that was not all.  Just as important was how very much she 
loved her back.  Whether or not Ami was devoted to her, Makoto 
still would have cared for her above all else.  Besides, what was 
unknown in any case?  Ami loved her and she knew now that she 
loved Ami, with every part of her being.  No matter how busy her 
job kept her, part of her always longed to be with her best 
friend, her love.  Each night, she dashed to her computer to 
check her email, hoping to find a message from her, which she 
inevitably did.  Makoto was no longer a child trying to survive 
in a world alone.  She was a woman, an independent, strong, and 
successful woman.  She loved Mizuno Ami with all of her heart and 
anything else be damned.

Without warning, she took Ami in her arms and pulled her 
close, pressing her lips desperately against her love&#39;s.  
Startled only for a moment, Ami soon responded in kind, letting 
loose some of the passion that she had kept bottled up for so 
long.  Makoto&#39;s lips parted, her tongue seeking Ami&#39;s hungrily.  
All of the work Ami had done straightening Makoto&#39;s hair went to 
waste as her fingers wrapped themselves in the auburn strands.  
Eventually the two women parted, breathless.

&quot;I&#39;m tired of waiting, Ami,&quot; Makoto sighed, trying to regain some 
control of herself.  &quot;I love you and I have for a very long 
time.  I was just too stupid and scared to deal with it.&quot;

Ami smiled, willing her heart to slow down.  Ignoring the fires 
raging inside herself, she laid her head on Makoto&#39;s chest and 
wrapped her arms around her waist.  &quot;I love you, too, Mako.  I&#39;m 
glad we can spend our eternity together, instead of waiting for 
each other.&quot;

&quot;Eternity,&quot; Makoto whispered in awe.  The full force of what was 
happening hit her all at once, but she found she wasn&#39;t 
frightened any more.  Instead, it was as if her entire soul had 
been wrapped in a warm, comfy blanket.  For the first time in 
living memory, she was truly happy and content.   Cupping Ami&#39;s 
chin gently, she leaned down and kissed her again, this time much 
more tenderly.  

Many kisses later, and still breathless, Ami whispered, &quot;I 
suppose we won&#39;t be going to any movies tonight, will we?&quot;  Ami 
gasped sharply as Makoto&#39;s strong hands and passionate lips 
provided her reply.
