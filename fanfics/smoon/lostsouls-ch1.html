<h1>Lost Souls (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sango.html">Sango</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: This is my first InuYasha/Sailor Moon Crossover 
FanFic. I hope it turns out alright. But, Before I get started, I&#39;d 
like to point out a few things...

In this fic, The main character&#39;s ages are as follows:

InuYasha:

InuYasha - err? How old -is- InuYasha?
Kagome - 15
Sango - 17
Maya - 16

Sailor Moon:

Usagi - 15
Rei - 16
Makoto - 15
Ami - 15
Minako - 15
Michiru - 18
Haruka - 18
Setsuna - ???

The pairings:

Rei/Usagi
Makoto/Ami
Minako/Setsuna
Haruka/Michiru
Hotaru/ChibiUsa

InuYasha/Kagome
Sango/Maya

This fic is also very strange. Oh, and you should know, that in my 
fic, Rei is a ninja, and Sango(I) had a sister. Rei is the 
reincarnation of her sister(although you weren&#39;t supposed to know that 
yet...) Well, anyway, I can&#39;t think of anything else to add in, except 
that Maya shows up in a later chapter. And I(Sango) am in love with 
Kagome, but when Maya makes her appearance, blah blah blah. Just read 
my story, alright? Thank you ^_^. Let&#39;s get started now...

~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~

~-Hikawa Jinja-~

Rei, Usagi, Makoto, Minako, Ami, Setsuna, Michiru, Haruka, Hotaru, and 
ChibiUsa are all at the shrine talking...

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot; Usagi says.

Setsuna nods, &quot;I am afraid so,&quot; says the greenhaired woman.

&quot;Well, What can we do?&quot; Makoto questions.

&quot;We must go to that time and prevent if from occurring...&quot; Setsuna 
responds.

&quot;Well, What are we waiting for? We should go!&quot; Minako says.

&quot;And...&quot; continues Setsuna, &quot;The only way to arrive there 
successfully, is with the power of the Ginsuishou.&quot; she looks at 
Usagi.

&quot;That&#39;s not a problem.&quot; Usagi says, looking down at the crystal 
locket.

&quot;Then, We will leave tomorrow.&quot; Michiru says.

&quot;Why tomorrow? Won&#39;t that just bring them a step closer to destroying 
this world?&quot; asks Ami.

Rei had been sitting there, without speaking the entire time they had 
been there. She didn&#39;t understand it... The senshi had all thought 
that the youma problem was over and done with... But, then again, War 
never truly ends...

&quot;May be... But we all need to be at full strength when we leave here. 
I have a feeling the danger will insue as soon as we arrive there...&quot; 
says Haruka.

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right...&quot; Usagi says.

&quot;So, We&#39;ll meet back here at exactly 11:00 AM tomorrow,&quot; says Hotaru.

The others nod, and Setsuna stands, walking out the door first. Makoto 
and Ami soon follow, and Minako walks out after Setsuna. Rei is still 
looking down at her lap, clenching her fists on her miko robe, causing 
the fabric to bunch.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Usagi&#39;s voice came.

Rei looks up. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rei?&quot; she questions.

&quot;I just... when we make it to the other time, what will happen? Won&#39;t 
there be any disturbance in the timeline?&quot; Rei asks.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s just a chance we&#39;ll have to take. They are 
attacking from the past, and there is no other way to retaliate. This 
is the only possible course of action. If we don&#39;t go this way, How 
are we going to protect this planet?&quot; Usagi says.

&quot;You&#39;re right, Usagi. I can&#39;t believe you are actually serious about 
something... I guess there is a first time for everything...&quot; Rei 
says.

&quot;Hey! What&#39;s that supposed to mean!?&quot; Usagi questions, giving Rei her 
version of the death glare.

Rei giggles slightly, before stopping, and looking back down. She had 
almost forgot about the situation at hand...

&quot;Rei... Trust me... It&#39;ll be fine...&quot; Usagi says, and smiles at her 
friend reassuringly.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re right.&quot; Rei says, &quot;Well, Either way, I suppose I&#39;ll see 
you tomorrow at 11:00...&quot;

Usagi nods, and heads on out the door. Rei sighs. She loved to talk to 
her princess, but at the same time, she was nervous every time she 
came around... Why?... Rei sips her tea, and sits it on the teatable, 
before looking up at the clock. It reads 9:00. The meeting had lasted 
a while, and already it was dark out. Rei finishes her tea, while 
thinking about the mission of returning to an earlier timeline... She 
hoped they made it safely. It wasn&#39;t herself she was worried about... 
It was Usagi... The princess... -Her- princess... Rei sits the teacup 
down, and heads to her room to get some much needed sleep before the 
departure...
