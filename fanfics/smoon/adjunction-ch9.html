<p>“<em>Someone  as close as her best friend could have fallen in love with her and  she wouldn't have the slightest clue- Rei-chan's really so dense  after all...” </em></p>
<p>“<em>What  do you expect? How would </em>you <em>feel if you suddenly heard that  your best friend was in love with you?” </em></p>
<p>“<em>We'll  just go for a distant visual check- if they're okay, we'll come back  alone; if they're not, we'll go check on them and get help and all  that. Okay? Can we go?”</em></p>
<p>“Do  you see them yet? Over.”</p>
<p>Rei  was still groaning as she muttered into the walkie-talkie Usagi had  “conveniently” forgotten to take out of her bag. “No.” What  was she doing with five of them anyway?</p>
<p>“Rei-chan,  you're supposed to say, 'Over'!”</p>
<p>She  heard Minako giggle. “Yes, you really should, Rei-chan. Over.”</p>
<p>Rei  shook her head. Suddenly, she caught sight of the two in question and  ducked behind a nearby tree. She hissed, “I see them. About forty  yards to the right of the shrine steps.” After a pause, Rei sighed  and added, “Over.”</p>
<p>“On  our way, Over!”</p>
<p>Rei  peeked around to watch their target. Mako-chan had both hands  pressing against the trunk of a tree, trapping Ami between them. Her  head seemed bent towards Ami's... was Minako right after all?</p>
<p>“Ooh...  looks juicy, doesn't it?”</p>
<p>Rei  was about to exclaim and turn around when a hand went swiftly over  her mouth. She could still feel the chillingly familiar breath on her  ear... Wait? Familiar? Since when?</p>
<p>Minako  giggled as she slowly withdrew her hand. “Quiet now, Hino. Don't  want them to find us...”</p>
<p>“Indeed...”  Rei started a little when Usagi slowly stood up beside them, her eyes  glinting. “We certainly can't. But doesn't it sound like they're  talking? Let's get closer.”</p>
<p>“Hold  it,” Rei hissed, grabbing hold of Usagi's arm. “You just said  we'd get a visual check, and they're obviously fine. You said we'd go  back afterwards.”</p>
<p>Usagi  pouted. “But aren't you curious? We're already here and all... what  harm could it do?”</p>
<p>Minako  looked up thoughtfully. “Well, if that were me there, dealing with  post confession material, I certainly wouldn't want to be disturbed  by a third party.”</p>
<p>Rei  glared at Usagi. “See?”</p>
<p>Usagi  continued to pout. “But... but... What will I tell Motoki-chan?”</p>
<p>Minako  and Rei hissed at the same time, “Nothing! Don't tell him <em>anything</em> about this!”</p>
<p>Usagi's  pout deepened in sorrow. “But why? Mako-chan's married! And as the  news reporter of our little circle-”</p>
<p>Rei  glared at her. “We- said- say- <em>nothing</em>. Especially if you  don't know the facts. It could just be a complete misunderstanding.” <em>Though that's doubtful at this point...</em></p>
<p>Minako  nodded in agreement. “Usagi-chan, if you promise not to meddle in  this thing with Ami-chan and Mako-chan, I'll give you a ticket to my  concert in two days.”</p>
<p>Rei  blinked. <em>A concert that soon? No, what am I saying, for someone  like Minako, that's almost late.</em></p>
<p>Usagi  readily agreed, smiling wide. Rei sighed. Crisis diverted, for now,  at least.</p>
<p>It  just had to be then that Ami-chan's voice was raised, enough for them  to hear it from their hiding spot.</p>
<p>“Mako-chan!  Let me go!”</p>
<p>“No!  Not until I know! Tell me... please!”</p>
<p>“Mako-chan!”</p>
<p>The  voices quieted down, but they still seemed to be talking.</p>
<p>Rei  was growing uncomfortable. “Guys... we really shouldn't be  interrupting them...”</p>
<p>Minako  caught the same vibe. “Mako-chan obviously needs this. Either way,  no matter what decision Ami-chan makes... Mako-chan needs it... in  order to move on.”</p>
<p>Usagi  looked between them, her intuition failing her. “Eh? What'dyou  mean? Why would Mako-chan need... this? Doesn't it look like the both  of them are hurting?”</p>
<p>Minako  looked away. “Sometimes, when it comes to love, you need to be hurt  before you can be healed.”</p>
<p>Rei  murmured, “Then again, sometimes the damage runs too deep to heal,  but that's what friends are for.” She turned away, and started  walking. “Come on, we'll wait for them upstairs, and leave the door  open for them.”</p>
<p>Usagi  stared as Minako silently followed Rei's lead. She looked between  them, and her two other friends. “W-wait!” She stage whispered,  running after them. “You really think it's okay to leave them like  this?”</p>
<p>She  didn't receive an answer, but with one last look back, she didn't  have the heart to argue with it. Instead, she prayed that it would be  resolved peacefully, with no more harm than necessary, if any was  necessary at all.</p>
<p>---------------O.O!</p>
<p>Makoto grit her teeth, her head hung  low, as she pushed away from the tree. “It's that way, isn't it? I  ruined our friendship... to have felt this way about you... you must  hate me, right?”</p>
<p>Ami leaned against the tree, her hands  grasping at... she blinked, raising her hand. She sighed, hugging the  item to her while Makoto's back was turned. “I... brought your  favorite... I know it was supposed to be for Minako... but for some  reason... I found myself picking it for you instead.”</p>
<p>Makoto went rigid, and she slowly  turned. Ami held the bottle out to her. “I never gave you a wedding  present. I'm sorry. I...” Ami smiled a little, looking away. “One  more night... like the first time... we drank together. I don't hate  you, Mako-chan. And I don't want to stop being be-... close friends.  So...” Their eyes met, and it was then that Makoto realized what  was wrong. It wasn't her fault. But it was too late to change the  clocks now. “So will one night be enough?”</p>
<p>“...Ami-chan...”</p>
<p>Ami looked up at her questioningly.</p>
<p>“Is it alright... to... to hug you?”</p>
<p>Ami smiled. “If this had happened  years ago... before growing up changed me... just a little too  much...” She stepped forward, and wrapped her arms around Makoto's  middle. “If it was like that... I'm not sure I would have had the  courage to answer you with, 'Tonight... for tonight... I want to make  your dreams come true. Every single one... that I can. In a night.'”</p>
<p>“Ami-chan... are you... serious?”</p>
<p>Ami snuggled deeper as Makoto wrapped  her arms around her. “A doctor should have no right to lie to those  she sees in pain. All I want to do is help you heal.”</p>
<p>Makoto's body started to shake, and at  first Ami couldn't tell what it was from. She heard laughter. She  felt the tears raining down on her own heart. “It'd be suicide...”  Makoto whispered with a resigned smile, “To let me know for sure  how it could have been. To live away from that sort of bliss... after  truly knowing it. To make my dreams come true... would really make me  break my wedding vows. I know this and yet... and yet...”</p>
<p>“Mako-chan?”</p>
<p>Makoto broke away from the embrace,  carefully extracting the wine bottle from Ami's hands. She did her  best to smile, even though tears ran down her eyes, just like that  day, or days, so long ago, when she waited stubbornly for a princely  date that never came. “Let's meet up with Minako-chan and the  others. This bottle is too big, and too great, to keep between us  anymore. It's better... to share, so our own cups don't overfill,  right?”</p>
<p>Ami stared at her a moment, before her  own smile appeared. Not forced, but not happy. “Yes... let's do  that.”</p>
<p>Makoto smiled a little wider after  roughly rubbing her eyes. “Let's go then. Though... did you bring  anything else? We might need extras to... well...”</p>
<p>Ami genuinely smiled before she sighed  and looked up at the first stars. “You heard them listening in too,  huh?”</p>
<p>Makoto changed her smile accordingly.  “Usagi hasn't changed after all.”</p>
<p>Ami shrugged helplessly as she tugged  Makoto's hand. “Let them believe that everything is fine between  us. And with Usagi's magic, it will be completely true before long.”</p>
<p>Makoto looked at the hand intertwined  with hers, honestly surprised. Suddenly, she grinned, the sadness and  anxiety from before slowly slipping away. “Want to make a bet? See  which one of us can get Usagi the most drunk.”</p>
<p>Ami's eyes widened. “Mako-chan! Why?  As a doctor-”</p>
<p>Makoto shook her head. “There's not  enough here to make her sick or anything anyway. Hung over,  naturally, if this is the same potency as last time. It's just to  make sure our secret tonight stays secret, you know?” Makoto  winked.</p>
<p>Ami stared at her for a moment, before  lowering her head with a sigh. “What do I get if I win?”</p>
<p>Makoto considered it as they started up  the shrine steps. “Ah! Usagi probably finished off all the pastries  by now. It actually came out really good, you know! So... if you win,  I'll bake a whole batch just- for- <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>Ami considered it in an overdramatic  way. “Then... if you win... I'll give you this book I think you'll  really like.”</p>
<p>“Which book?”</p>
<p>Ami smiled. “It's- a- se-cret. But  I'll make sure to write a note in it.”</p>
<p>Makoto smiled and shook her head.  “Deal. And no fair getting help from Rei or Minako- if they got any  heads up on it, we'd never win. But they get their share too, got  it?”</p>
<p>Ami nodded. “I know. And, like  before, the most important rule is-”</p>
<p>Makoto started running up the steps,  grasping Ami's hand comfortably. “What else? To have some fun!”</p>
<p>O.O---------------...</p>
<p>“NO! Absolutely not!”</p>
<p>“Awww come on, Rei-chan-! Just a  little?”</p>
<p>Cheeks and ears bright red, Rei sat  rigid in her seat, while at the same time trying to forcefully pin  down the two nosy companions who were desperately curious to see  Rei's Aino Collection.</p>
<p>Minako, impervious to her glare but  waiting until the last moment to show it, leaned closer to Rei, as  they were along the same length of the table, and looked at her with  big, doll-yet-puppy-like eyes.</p>
<p>The archnemesis of the glare-of-doom.</p>
<p>Rei continued to attempt to fight the  losing battle, never even noticing that Usagi had sneaked out of her  sight once Minako had her distracted. Distracted by those beautiful  brown eyes... full of warmth... of love... Rei roughly jerked away,  the blush having deepened, trying to quash the feelings welling up  within her back to an endurable point.</p>
<p>Just in time to hear Usagi cant, “I-  found- it!”</p>
<p>Rei whirled around, now conflicted as  Minako got up to join Usagi. After gathering her wits, she hurried  towards her closet, where Usagi and Minako were currently sifting  through one of the boxes of merchandise she had stowed away behind  her clothes...</p>
<p>“Wow! How cute! It's a plushie,  Minako-chan! I didn't even know they had these of you!”</p>
<p>“Trading cards! When were there  trading cards? Aiyah... I really need a talk with that publicity  manager or whatever... Rei-chan, where did you get these?”</p>
<p>Rei slunk down, her bent legs flanking  her as she stared off into space, as if the world had come to an end.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan?”</p>
<p>As Usagi continued looking through it,  Minako freed her hands of merchandise and crawled over to where Rei  had stopped. She waved a hand in front of Rei's eyes, to no avail. <em>How curious, </em>Minako thought to herself. <em>Did she pass out  from shock?</em></p>
<p>A mischievous grin  crossed her lips as an idea came to her. Leaning forward even  further, she whispered into Rei's ear, “Rei-chan is so lucky. She  has so much irreplaceable merchandise... not to mention she's her  idol's best friend... AH-Rei-chan!”</p>
<p>Rei, after having  only registered that Minako had said 'her' idol's best friend  (insinuating that Minako was Rei's), yelped and fell backward, her  knee catching Minako's stomach thereby causing <em>her</em> to lose  balance.</p>
<p>The end result?  Makoto and Ami came in all cheers to see Minako half-pinning and  half-lying-on-top-of Rei.</p>
<p>“Oh-ho... looks like the party's  already started huh? And to think you're alcohol free now too...!”</p>
<p>But Rei had once  again blocked out the world. Minako's long hair framed her face,  providing a shroud of darkness, preventing others from seeing how  their eyes met, their lips parted, dreams flashing before them in a  flurry of desire...</p>
<p>It did not help  that in the confusion, one of Minako's hands had fallen over Rei's  heart, as if she were trying to grab hold of it, instead of the  ground beside her, like the other had.</p>
<p>It also did not  help that Rei's knee, which was at first on Minako's stomach, had  slipped just barely between the idol's legs instead.</p>
<p>It also did not  help... that the aforementioned things prevented either of them from  keeping up the shields of immorality that had kept them apart for so  long.</p>
