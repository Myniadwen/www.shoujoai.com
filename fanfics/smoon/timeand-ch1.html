<h1>Time and... What the Hell?</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mwarrior1.html">Moon Warrior 1</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I was going to call this changing times, but I&#146;ll save that title for 
a different fanfic.  This is at the end of Sailor Moon.  Spoilers 
ahead.  After Sailor Stars .Must note:  Hotaru is about 16 years old 
and Renee&#146;s in the future.  (Told you)  I&#146;m typing this because I read 
a fanfic in which Serena and Setsuna get together.  (I use both dub 
and original names.).  However, there was no explanation how it 
happened, so I decided to type a fanfic on how it could happen.  Hope 
I can.  I do not own Sailor Moon, I am writing this fanfic getting no 
money.  Naoko Takeuchi and others own Sailor Moon, I do not, please 
don&#146;t sue.  This is Moon Warrior 1.  Hope you enjoy this.

------------------------------------------------------------

Setsuna woke up, she felt arms around her:  &#145;What th-&#145;:  then 
remembered, the princess, no Serena was holding her:  &#145;Oh boy, I guess 
I&#146;m sleeping in again.&#146;:  She knew if she tried to get up she&#146;d wake 
her lover.  It wasn&#146;t too bad being able to sleep in.  She&#146;d never 
really had a chance to try it before:  &#145;Might as well go to back to 
sleep.  She put her arms around the princess who sighed contentedly 
and tried to sleep.  She couldn&#146;t sleep, she felt too happy.  She 
started to recall how this had all started.  What the other scouts had 
told her while she was falling in love.

&#145;Do I deserve so much happiness, that wasn&#146;t exactly my first thought 
after&#133;.&#146;:

&#147;Serena, what the hell&#146;s the matter with you.&#148;:  Rei
  
&#147;Serena, you have to focus.&#148;: Ami

&#147;Just leave me alone alright.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;: Mina

&#147;Yeah girl, you&#146;ve hardly touched anything.&#148;:  Lita

&#147;I DON&#146;T want to talk about it.&#148;

&#147;Look space cadet, your grades have been going down, and&#133;.  Your 
really starting to be a drain on us all.&#148;:Rei

&#147;Well, if I&#146;m in your way, I&#146;ll just leave then.&#148;

The rest:  &#145;SERENA!&#148;

&#147;Look, I can&#146;t handle this right now, and I can&#146;t handle her.  Bye.&#148;

&#147;Serena, wait.  I&#146;l&#133;  I&#146;ll come with you.&#148;:  Ami

&#147;No&#133;  No you guys stay and study, I need to be alone, I need time 
to&#133;to think.&#148;

&#147;What!!!!&#148;:  All four.

&#147;Thanks anyway Ami.&#148;

Serena left.

&#147;That was harsh Rei.&#148;:  Lita

&#147;Way harsh.&#148;:  Mina

&#147;Rei, she&#146;s our friend.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m&#133;  I&#146;m worried about her too.&#148;:  Rei

&#147;Rei&#133;&#148;:  Ami

&#147;I&#133;The words just, I don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#147;Serena will be fine, she always bounces back.  Maybe she just wanted 
to bail.&#148;

&#147;Mina!!!&#148;:  All three

&#147;At any rate, I need to study, Mina&#146;s right, our princess is strong.  
She will overcome whatever is daunting her.&#148;:Amy

&#147;Huh?&#148;:  Mina Rei and Lita

&#147;What Mina said.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;:   All three.

They decided to return to their studies and help Serena when she was 
ready.  

Serena had found her way to the arcade.  She looked around:

&#147;Hey Keith.&#148;

&#147;Hey Serena, Andrew&#146;s not here, sorry.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;

She was almost outside when:

&#147;Hey Meatballhead, aren&#146;t you supposed to be studying.&#148;

&#147;Hhhh, hey Haruka.&#148;

&#147;Glad to see you too.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s just&#133;&#148;:  Serena bowed her head and started to cry.  
Not wailing.  Not her usual waterworks over something small.  
Heartfelt tears.

&#145;Uh oh.  If that guy&#133;.&#146;: Thought Haruka:  &#147;You want to get something 
to eat Serena.&#148;

&#147;No thanks.&#148;

&#145;Worse than I thought.&#146;:  &#147;Guys, Serena and I are going across the 
street, come join us in a while.&#148;

&#147;Haruka, I had no desire to be here in-&#147;

&#147;After Setsuna and I finish playing, we&#146;ll be along.&#148;

&#147;Haruka, was that?&#148;  :Serena

&#147;Yeah Michiru and Setsuna, Hotaru&#146;s here too.&#148;

&#147;Hh hh mmphh.&#148;

&#147;You alright.&#148;

&#147;Hahaha, yeah, I never thought Setsuna would set foot in an arcade.&#148;

&#147;As I stated-&#147;

&#147;Pay attention, you&#146;re losing.  I want a challenge.&#148;

&#147;As I have little choice.&#148;

&#147;How&#146;d you do it?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll tell you over some food.&#148;

&#147;I do&#133;Sigh&#133;  Maybe&#133;Never mind.&#148;

&#145;Is this really happening, she&#146;s turning down food.&#146;

&#147;Then you can watch me eat.&#148;

&#147;I-&#147;

&#147;Or would you prefer to keep blocking the door.&#148;

&#147;Huh?  You could have told me-&#147;

&#147;Let&#146;s go&#148;: Haruka took her hand and pulled her along.

&#147;I didn&#146;t say-&#147;

&#147;We&#146;re friends right?&#148;

&#147;Of course, how could you ask if-&#147;

&#147;Well, you could at least sit at a table with me.  We could talk.&#148;

&#147;I..  I want to, but.&#148;

&#147;But what?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;d tell me grow up.&#148;

&#147;If I promise not to utter those words, will you accompany me?&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s utter mean?&#148;

&#147;Say.&#148;

&#147;Huh?  Oh.&#148;

&#147;Here we are.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, I guess so.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna, shouldn&#146;t we see what there up to?:   Michiru

&#147;They will need a little longer.&#148;

&#147;When was the last time we actually relaxed?.&#148;:  Hotaru

Setsuna almost said something then just stopped.

&#147;Sets?  You okay?&#148;

&#147;no, impossible.&#148;  She whispered.

&#147;Setsuna?!&#148;:  Hotaru

&#147;I&#146;m fine, you two see to Serena, I&#146;m going home.&#148;

&#147;Whaaat?!!!&#148;:  Hotaru and Michiru.

&#147;I.. Never mind.  I need-&#147;

&#147;Setsuna, she needs us.  She would never skip her studying, well not 
now, unless somet- &#147;:  Michiru looked at Setsuna, she whispered:  &#147;Is 
it an enemy?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;:  Setsuna thought for a moment then:  &#147;No, I shall come with 
you.&#148;, &#145;Maybe, I can make sure what&#133;No, it was a barely possible 
event, still.&#146;

&#147;Good, you said we should go&#148;: Michiru

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;You sure you&#146;re alright&#148;: Hotaru.

&#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148;

They arrived, in the caf&eacute; window, they could see Haruka and Serena, 
Haruka appeared to be holding her.

&#147;Hmmm.&#148;:  Michiru

&#147;Sigh.&#148;, &#145;Should have remembered that.&#146;:  Setsuna

&#147;Michiru&#148;: Hotaru

&#147;Let&#146;s see what they&#146;re up to&#148;: Michiru.

They went in and got to the table.

&#147;Haruka, comfortable&#148;: Michiru

Haruka disengaged from Serena:  &#147;You&#146;re so cute when you&#146;re jealous.&#148;

&#147;Do I need to be jealous?&#148;

Serena looked at them, she wiped a tear from her eye:  &#147;I&#133; I..I&#146;m 
sorry &#133;   I mean c&#146;mon I&#146;m not.-&#147;

Haruka laughed, Serena glared at her.

&#147;C&#146;mon Meatballhead, I have to get Michiru mad every once in a while, 
she&#146;s much be-&#147;

&#147;Stop there if you don&#146;t want to sleep on the couch tonight.&#148;

&#147;Shouldn&#146;t we sit down.&#148;:  Hotaru

&#147;A good idea&#148;: Setsuna.

Setsuna and Hotaru sat across from Haruka and Serena, while Michiru 
sat beside Serena, boxing her in between her and Haruka.

&#147;So, what&#146;s up?&#148;:  Michiru.

&#147;I really don&#146;t want to-&#147;: Serena.

&#147;Tell them&#148;: Haruka

&#147;But_&#148;

&#147;Then let me.&#148;

Serena bowed her head, she whispered:  &#147;Haruka.&#148;

&#147;Maybe, they can help.  You can trust us.  Your our-&#147;

&#147;Please don&#146;t use the P word.  I makes me-&#147;

&#147;Friend.&#148;

&#147;Alright.&#148;

Serena started telling them what happened.  Darien had decided to stay 
in America longer.  He was supposed to be coming back soon, but had 
changed his mind.  She said how he thought he could make more money.   
And how classes were easier: His marks would be much higher from 
there.  She started to cry.  Haruka was about to hold her when:

&#147;My turn.&#148;  Michiru brought Serena&#146;s head to her shoulder.

&#147;I I&#146;m fine&#133;  It&#146;s just, I can&#146;t&#133;  He&#146;s always there.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;:  Michiru and Hotaru

&#147;Hotaru, perhaps we should let Haruka and Michiru-&#147;

&#147;Setsuna, are you suggesting we leave?&#148;

Michiru, Haruka and Hotaru glared at her.

&#147;Sigh, forget it.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s okay Setsuna, if you don&#146;t want to see me cry.&#148;

&#147;I&#133;  I&#146;m sorry&#148;, Setsuna felt badly, but, no she felt badly.

&#147;Let me explain what she means, and Haruka told them.: &#147; To Serena, 
Darien was still around, yet not there, everything and everyone made 
her think of him.  Her friends and family would sooner or later 
mention him.  She had gifts from him in her room, she couldn&#146;t put 
them away, or she&#146;d feel worse.&#148;

Serena interrupted:  &#147;So, I feel&#133; I don&#146;t know.  Alone.&#148;

&#147;You have friends Serena&#148;: Setsuna.

&#147;But, I&#133;  They&#146;d think I was being a crybaby.  But, I miss him, yet&#133;&#147;

&#147;You&#146;re mad at him.&#148;:  Hotaru

Everyone looked at Hotaru.

&#147;I&#133;.Yeah.&#148;

&#147;I have an idea&#148;: Hotaru

&#147;Hotaru.&#148;:  Setsuna, she then kicked her leg.

&#147;Setsuna?!&#148;

&#147;The, Serena can find her own solution.&#148;

Hotaru looked into Setsuna&#146;s eyes, then said:  &#147;Dangerous?&#148;

&#147;&#133;.Yes and no.&#148;

She whispered:  &#147;World threatening?&#148;

&#147;&#133;I don&#146;t know&#133;.  No&#148;

Hotaru then looked at Serena, deep into her eyes  then:  &#147;You need a-&#147;

&#147;Hotaru!!!&#148;

&#147;Vacation.&#148;

&#147;Vacation?&#148;:  Serena.

&#147;To get away.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t have the money, I mean, it would be nice.&#148;

Haruka thought for a moment then:  &#147;Haruka.&#148;:  Setsuna growled,  &#147;It&#146;s 
a good idea, and I just had a better one.&#148;:  Haruka:  &#147;She could 
stay-&#147;

&#147;Haruka!&#148;

&#147;with us.&#148;

Setsuna sighed

&#147;Setsuna, you&#133;you don&#146;t, did I do something&#148;: Serena

&#147;Forgive me&#133;  I should leave, perhaps I too need a vacation.&#148;

Serena&#146;s eyes started to tear up:  &#147;Please, tell me what I did?&#148;

&#147;No, it&#146;s what I&#146;ve been doing&#133;.  Or seeing.&#148;

Serena&#146;s eyes got wide:  &#147;The future.&#148;, she whispered.

&#147;&#133;.  This is not your fault, it is&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Darien&#146;s.&#148;:  Haruka

Serena looked at her:  &#147;What did he do?&#148;

Haruka started to breathe heavily, then:  &#147;Don&#146;t worry about it.&#148;

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;Serena, perhaps we should get back to you staying with us&#148;: Michiru

Setsuna didn&#146;t say anything, but she started to tap her foot.

&#147;No, I couldn&#146;t, I&#146;m sure I&#146;ll be alright (Setsuna&#146;s foot stopped 
tapping and she had a sigh of relief, which didn&#146;t go unnoticed.&#148;, 
besides-&#147;

&#147;Look, if you change your mind, you&#146;re always welcome&#148;: Haruka

&#147;That goes for me too&#148;: Michiru

&#147;Same here&#148;: Hotaru

&#147;If you truly need to stay with us, do not hesitate&#148;: Setsuna

&#147;You have other friends besides us, talk to them&#148;: Haruka

Setsuna glared at her

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, I&#146;ll try.&#148;

&#147;Serena, perhaps you should-&#147;

&#147;Setsuna, let&#146;s go back to the arcade&#148;: Hotaru

&#147;But-&#147;

Hotaru, Michiru and Haruka were of the same mind

&#147;Hotaru wants to play the game some more&#148;: Haruka.

&#147;She needs a partner&#148;:  Michiru

&#147;Very well.&#148;

Hotaru and Setsuna went back to the arcade.  Serena, Michiru and 
Haruka stayed and talked.  They assured her Setsuna wasn&#146;t mad at her 
and nothing was wrong.  Inside however, both were peeved at Setsuna.  
They assured her she could stay with them if she need to.

Outside:  &#147;Setsuna, what was THAT!&#148;

&#147;Hotaru, the future&#146;s changed.&#148;

&#147;Is Rini?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s fine, so&#146;s Crystal Tokyo, but-&#147;

&#147;Then no problem.&#148;

&#147;But&#133;.  Something&#133;&#133;-&#147;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;No, it&#146;s nothing.&#148;:  Setsuna closed her eyes for a moment, opened 
them then:  &#147;&#133;  You&#146;re right, I was mean to her, I&#146;ll make it up to 
her.&#148;

&#147;You should, but, what else, what&#146;s bothering you?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s nothing, merely.  Nothing.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna.&#148;

&#147;Something I thought might happen, but it&#146;s not possible.&#148;

&#147;Is it dangerous?&#148;

&#147;Perhaps to me.&#148;:  She whispered.

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;Good, we&#146;re here.&#148;:  They had reached the arcade.

&#147;Is this necessary?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Sigh, very well.&#148;

They went in and played the games.

A few hours later at their place:  Setsuna was reading a book as was 
Hotaru.  Haruka and Michiru entered the room.

&#147;Setsuna.&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;Hotaru, would you please explain what I told you, I&#146;m going to bed.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna, we need to talk.&#148;:  Michiru

&#147;Please ask Hotaru.&#148;:  And she went to her room.

They looked at Hotaru.  She explained how the timeline had changed, 
and what Setuna had told her later.  That inviting Serena to stay with 
them could change it more.

&#147;Great.&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;Is it-&#147;

&#147;No, no danger.&#148;

Haruka thought for a moment, then:  &#147;If she comes she&#146;s welcome.&#148;

&#147;Haruka!&#148;:  Michiru

&#147;I agree.&#148;:  Hotaru

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;No danger, no problem.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna said-&#147;

&#147;Is change really so bad, my life changed when you entered it.&#148;

&#147;Fine.&#148;

Two weeks later:  &#145;The phone&#146;s ringing.&#146;, then it stopped, &#145;I&#133;I don&#146;t 
want-&#145;.  She fell back to sleep.

Setsuna awoke the next morning.  She could feel the stickiness.  &#145;Why 
must I dream that, it&#146;ll never happen, do&#133; do I want it to happen?&#146;.  
In the dream she had been happy, yet, what happened in that dream went 
against what she believed was right.  &#145;Just a dream.&#146;

Knock, knock.

&#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;Breakfast&#146;s ready.  It&#146;s not like you to still be in bed.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll be there in a while.&#148;

&#147;You and&#133;&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Nothing.&#148;.  And Michiru left

Setsuna got out of the shower:  &#145;Better, the smell&#146;s gone.&#146;.  She got 
dreesed and headed down the stairs.

Haruka, Michiru and Hotaru were all there.

&#147;Usually, you&#146;d be gone by now.&#148;:  Setsuna

&#147;We need to talk.&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;Setsuna, you&#146;ll have to understand.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t-&#147;:  She then noticed a fifth chair at the table.

&#147;&#133;..&#148;:  Setsuna  blanched

&#147;You know then.&#148;

She nodded:  I&#133;  I need to go.&#148;

&#147;Sit down.&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;Her friends gave her a hard time, so did her family, except her mom.  
You are not going to make her feel worse.  Whatever the problem is, 
we&#146;ll solve it.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna, besides being her friend, you have a responsibility to 
her.&#148;:  Hotaru

&#147;I&#133;&#148;

&#147;She is your friend, isn&#146;t she?&#148;:  Michiru

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Then you can eat breakfast with her.&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;Very well.&#148;

They sat for a few minutes then.

&#147;She doesn&#146;t seem to be up..&#148;:  Setsuna

&#147;I&#146;ll go get her.&#148;:  Haruka

Setsuna sat at the table fidgeting.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;:  Michiru.

&#147;&#133;  I&#146;m fine.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna&#133;.  Please tell us.&#148;:  Hotaru.

&#147;It&#146;s-&#147;

&#147;Sleeping beauty finally woke up.&#148;

&#147;Haruka!&#148;:  Serena

&#147;It would take&#133;..&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;A firehose.&#148;

&#147;Are you always this grumpy?&#148;

&#147;Only when being throttled.&#148;

&#147;C&#146;mon, I said I was sorry.&#148;

&#147;You two finished.&#148;:  Michiru.

&#147;I would like to eat&#133;.  While I&#146;m still young.&#148;:  Hotaru

&#147;Hotaru!&#133;  You&#146;ve been raised better than that.&#148;:  Setsuna

&#147;Hhhh, sorry.&#148;

 The five finally got to eating breakfast.  Having Serena there made 
them feel happy.  It made them forget past and future woes.  
Eventually Haruka, Michiru and Setsuna had to leave.  Only Serena and 
Hotaru were left.  After some discussion they agreed to study, then go 
shopping.  Serena, after shopping was flabbergasted to learn Hotaru 
was to study later with Setsuna that night.  She nearly went ballistic 
when Michiru and Haruka sugeested she study with them.  She finally 
agreed.

They finished studying, Setsuna said she was going out.

&#147;Hey Hotaru?&#148;

&#147;Yeah?&#148;

&#147;Did you notice,&#133;  Setsuna was &#133;  I don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#147;I noticed.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, she&#146;s probably not used to you yet.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;We usually study alone.&#148;

&#147;Was I&#133;  Was I bothering you?&#148;

&#147;Serena&#133;  No, it was fun.&#148;

&#147;You sure?&#148;

&#147;Sigh.&#148;

&#147;Okay.  So what do you do now.&#148;

&#147;Sleep usually.&#148;

&#147;What, but it&#146;s only&#133;  Holy shit.-&#147;

&#147;Serena!&#148;

&#147;But..  it&#146;s midnight.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, a good session.&#148;

&#147;But we wasted the whole night.&#148;

Hotaru gave Serena a cold glare:  &#147;You find studying a waste of time.&#148;

&#147;Sigh.  I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s just&#133;  There&#146;s more to life than studying.&#148;

Hotaru blushed:  &#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;You thinking about a special someone?&#148;

&#147;&#133;.&#148;

&#147;C&#146;mon spill.&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t, besides&#133;.  Thinking about h&#133;  that person makes me feel-&#147;

&#147;Lonely.  Sniff.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry I didn&#146;t mean to remind you-&#147;

&#147;It&#146;s okay.  I&#146;m not as sad anymore&#133;.  Hotaru, do you study to&#133;  Well 
to forget.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;It distracts you, doesn&#146;t it?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s mean.&#148;

Serena looked down:  &#147;I didn&#146;t mean you forget about&#133;  that person, 
just-&#147;

&#147;I&#133;  I never really thought&#133;  You do have a point.  If that&#146;s true:  I 
guess we all find things to fill our lives.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;To distract us from being lonely&#133;.  Omigoodness.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;By your theory, Setsuna must be the most lonely.&#148;

&#147;Hotaru, people do stuff, not just to not be lonely.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s your theory.&#148;

&#147;Yeah but you&#133;  extrapolated it.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#148;:  Hotaru stared at Serena.

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Maybe tonight wasn&#146;t a total waste of time.&#148;

&#147;I can use big words too.&#148;

Hotaru laughed.

&#147;It&#146;s not that funny.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m just imagining how the inners would react.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not, mmph, hh, hh hahaha, hh, yeah.&#148;

&#147;We should go to bed.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, but&#133;  You think Setsuna&#146;s lonely?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s your theory, and it does have merit.&#148;

&#147;But, she has all of you.&#148;

&#147;I know, but&#133;.  There&#146;s things she can&#146;t share with us.&#148;

&#147;The future.&#148;

&#147;Not just that&#133;.  I..  Never mind.&#148;

&#147;Please.&#148;

&#147;Well, Haruka has Michiru.  I, well, I&#146;m alone too, but not forever.&#148;

&#147;&#133;.  She could find somebody.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s drop this.&#148;

&#147;No, please Hotaru.&#148;

&#147;She has a responsibility, I think&#133;  She feels it&#146;s her destiny to be 
alone.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;If I tell you, you won&#146;t like it.&#148;

&#147;Go ahead.&#148;

&#147;Okay:  She feels the most responsible for protecting you.&#148;

&#147;Me?&#148;

&#147;She sees the future, it&#146;s her job to protect all of time, including 
the future.  And, you are, in some ways, the future.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..  I&#146;m not the future.  Everyone makes their own destiny.&#148;

&#147;Serena&#133;  But there&#146;s more to it than that.  She may have to leave and 
come back ten years later.&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;Her job:  Time, remember.&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;It wouldn&#146;t be easy on relationships.&#148;

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;She&#146;s a scout too.  She can&#146;t really tell too many people.&#148;

Serena started to tear up.

&#147;I I&#146;m sorry, please don&#146;t cry.&#148;

Serena slowly stopped:  &#147;I&#146;m alright&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s go to bed.&#148;

&#147;Hotaru, do you sometimes&#133; feel lonely?&#148;

&#147;Me?&#133;.  Why do you ask?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s about power&#133;  Power and responsibility.  You..  I mean with 
your-&#147;

&#147;Yes, but I have someone.&#148;

&#147;To talk to.&#148;

&#147;Not now.  But I know that person will come back.&#148;

&#147;Who?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;d rather not say.&#148;

&#147;hhn, you&#146;re lucky.&#148;

&#147;My someone will come back.&#148;

&#147;Why did&#133;  this person-&#147;

&#147;That&#146;s your room.&#148;

Serena and Hotaru had arrived upstairs.

&#147;Good night.&#148;

&#147;Ashita mimasu.&#148;

In bed Serena couldn&#146;t sleep:  &#145;Is it my fault Setsuna&#146;s lonely.  No&#133;  
But she&#133;  Sigh&#133;  So much responsibility&#133;.  I&#133;  Yes I can try to be a 
better friend to her.  I guess we all have this burden&#133;.  Me too.  
Hotaru wields the silence glaive.  I have the silver crystal, and 
Setsuna&#133;  She has so much to worry about.  I guess Setsuna and I have 
that in common.  Maybe&#133;  Maybe I can understand her better than the 
others, after all, I have the future to worry about too.&#146;:  Serena 
then fell to sleep.

Creak, creak.

&#145;Huh?  What is that?&#146;:  Serena took a look at the time:  &#145;3:00 A.M.. 
&#145;:  She shook her head:  &#145;Better check.&#146;.  She left the room silently.

&#147;Setsuna, you alright?&#148;

Setsuna had her hands against the wall and was leaning on it as she 
walked.

&#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148;:   Her head swayed from side to side:  &#147;Jus&#133;  Need.  
Ohhhhh.&#148;

&#147;Let me-&#147;

&#147;Said I wuz fine.&#148;:  She then almost fell.

&#147;Setsuna.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..  Fine.&#148;

Serena went over to help Setsuna, when Setsuna didn&#146;t stop her, she 
got under her arm.

&#147;This don&#146;t mean nothin.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Sorry,&#133;  Need bed.&#148;

Serena then helped Setsuna down the hall to her bed.

&#147;Okay, gowan.&#148;

&#147;Uhmm, you mind if I stay here a while.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t mm.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s get you to the toilet.&#148;

After Setsuna swallowed:  &#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148;

&#147;Your going to be sick.&#148;

&#147;I said. Mmmhhh.&#148;

&#147;C&#146;mon.&#148;:  Serena put her hand out to Setsuna who after making her 
wait took it.&#148;

Serena rushed Setsuna to the toilet.  They got there just in time as 
Setsuna heaved her guts into it.&#148;

For an half an hour Setsuna emptied her stomach.

&#147;Okay, I&#146;m fine now.&#148;

&#147;Just wait there a minute.&#148;

Serena left and came back with a bucket.

&#147;What&#146;s that for.&#148;

&#147;In case you get sick again.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t need it.&#148;

&#147;Trust me.&#148;

&#147;Sigh, fine.&#148;

Serena helped Setsuna back to her bed.

&#147;You leaving?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll be back.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t-&#147;:  Serena was gone.

&#145;Wanted to forget, now she&#146;s-&#145;

&#147;Here, drink it slowly.&#148;

Setsuna took the water from her.

&#147;&#133;  Thanks.&#148;

&#147;Not so fast.&#148;

Setsuna then sipped at the water.&#148;

&#147;Thank you, now-&#147;

Serena sat on the edge of the bed.

&#147;You can go.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..  Why?&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, why?&#148;

&#147;Because, I&#146;m fine.&#148;

&#147;Mmmm, nope.&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;First, you&#146;re not fine.  Second, you&#146;re not fine.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s the same reason.&#148;

&#147;No, it isn&#146;t.&#148;

Setsuna shook her head.

&#147;I can see you sweating, also, we sh..  I should get some food in you 
lat-&#147;

&#147;I-&#147;

&#147;Later.  Also, something&#146;s wrong if you drunk yourself sick.&#148;

&#147;You mean I&#146;m physically and psychologically sick.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t say that.&#148;

&#147;Then what did you say?&#148;

&#147;Something&#146;s wrong.&#148;

&#147;Look-&#147;

&#147;No, you look, you&#146;re my friend and I want TO KNOW WHAT&#146;S WRONG!?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll wake the house.&#148;

&#147;Sorry,&#133;  You aren&#146;t going to change the subject.&#148;

&#147;Sigh.&#148;

&#147;Well it&#146;s going to be a long night, move over.&#148;

Setsuna blanched.

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;You are not sleeping in this bed.&#148;:  She hissed.

Serena almost lost control, then:  &#147;Okay, I&#146;ll sleep in the chair.&#148;

&#147;I&#133;&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not leaving tonight till you tell me what&#146;s wrong.&#148;

&#147;Nothing.&#148;

&#147;Gonna be a long night&#133;  I&#146;ll get my blankets.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

Serena gave her a look that brooked no arguments.&#148;

&#147;Fine.&#148;

Serena came back and sat down:  &#147;Spill.&#148;

&#147;Already did.&#148;

Serena shook her head:  &#147;Not what I meant.&#148;

&#147;I need sleep.&#148;

&#147;Probably won&#146;t sleep for a while.&#148;

&#147;I can.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll be too thirsty.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll see.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll get a pitcher.&#148;

&#147;Ughh.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;That word.&#148;

&#147;Of water.&#148;

Serena left.

&#145;Why must she be so kind.&#146;

&#147;Okay, drink it slowly.&#148;

&#147;I only need one glass.&#148;

&#147;C&#146;mon, you need fluids.&#148;

&#147;Fluids?&#148;

&#147;Water, maybe some juice later.&#148;

Setsuna slowly drank her water than:  &#147;Good night.&#148;

&#147;Set-&#147;

Setsuna had lay down and closed her eyes.

&#147;Setsuna.&#148;

&#147;You okay?&#148;

&#147;Your scar-&#147;

&#147;ZZZ.&#148;

&#147;No way.&#148;

&#147;Well I&#146;m not leaving&#133;..  Fine, good night.&#148;

Setsuna wasn&#146;t asleep.  She had put herself into a trance.  She could 
hear Serena.  But didn&#146;t want to respond.  Eventually, she fell to 
sleep.

&#147;Uhnnn.  No.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Why?  Why do I, oh.&#148;

&#147;Huh, Setsuna?&#148;

&#147;WHY?!&#148;

&#147;Set..  She&#146;s asleep.&#148;

&#147;Please, I-&#147;

&#147;It&#146;s alright.&#148;

&#147;No.  Uhhnn.&#148;

Setsuna started to thrash around.  Serena tried soothing words to calm 
her.  Finally she managed to get on to the bed and hold her.

&#147;Shh, it&#146;s alright.&#148;

&#147;No, I.&#148;

Setsuna was calming down

&#147;Failed them.&#148;

&#147;Shh&#133;.  Nobody blames you.&#148;

&#147;My fault.&#148;

Serena rubbed her back:  &#147;&#133;   Don&#146;t blame yourself.&#148;

&#147;Let.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s alright.&#148;

&#147;Moon Kingdom.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..   Hhhh.  Not your fault.&#148;

&#147;die.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;  Setsuna, it isn&#146;t your fault.&#148;

&#147;Told.&#148;

&#147;Shhh.&#148;

&#147;Could&#146;ve told.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Uhhhn.&#148;:  Setsuna started to struggle.&#148;

&#147;Not your fault.&#148;

&#147;no?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

Setsuna calmed down and seemed to fall back to sleep.  Serena waited, 
when it felt like an hour had past, she left the bed:  &#145;She didn&#146;t 
want me sleeping with her.&#146;  Everything seemed alright then Setsuna 
started moaning again.  As quietly as she could Serena brought the 
chair over beside the bed.  She then took Setsuna hand in her own..

&#147;Shh., it&#146;s alright.&#148;

&#147;Hhhn.&#148;

Setsuna was quiet.  Serena left her hand in Setsuna&#146;s.  She was 
fidgeting in the chair to find a comfortable spot.  Her hand moved 
slightly.  Suddenly she felt a vice like grip.

&#147;Ow.&#148;

&#147;Please&#133;&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not leaving.&#148;

The grip lessened.

&#145;Guess I have to be uncomfortable.  Hope I can get to sleep.&#146;

It took a half hour before Serena fell to sleep..

Setsuna woke in the morning to find her hand being held.  She quickly 
pulled it back.

&#147;Hmm.&#148;

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;tired&#148;

&#147;I do ack.&#148;

&#145;Throat&#146;s so dry.&#148;:   Setsuna reached for the pitcher.  She started to 
gulp.

&#147;Hmm.  Slowly.&#148;

Setsuna looked, Serena was awake.  She pulled the pitcher away from 
Setsuna&#146;s mouth.

&#147;Drink it slowly.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;You want to be sick again.&#148;

&#147;Hhhhn.&#148;

&#147;Well?&#148;

&#147;I concur.&#148;

&#147;&#133;.  Good.&#148;

It was 6:30 in the morning, after half an hour, Setsuna said they had 
to get ready for the day.  Serena wanted to sleep in, Setsuna wouldn&#146;t 
let her.  She also suggested Setsuna stay in, Setsuna disagreed.

Later in the day Setsuna realized she wasn&#146;t seeing temporal visions.  
She kept calm until she got home.

&#147;Hello Setsuna.&#148;

&#147;Michiru&#133;  I&#133;.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong.&#148;

&#147;I&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;I CAN&#146;T SEE THE FUTURE!!1&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;I.&#148;:  Setsuna started crying, then took a hold of herself.

&#147;I told you this was a bad idea.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Having her here.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna&#133;.&#148;

&#147;HH, hh.&#148;

&#147;Try transforming.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Become Pluto.&#148;

&#147;Right.  Pluto Star Power.&#148;:  The room was bathed in green light as 
she transformed then Sailor Pluto stood before Michiru..

&#147;You can still become Sailor Pluto.&#148;

&#147;But I can&#146;t see the future.&#148;

&#147;Maybe&#133;  &#147;

Setsuna glared at her.

&#147;It could be a reward.&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;Do you like seeing, knowing everything that&#146;s going to happen.&#148;

&#147;It doesn&#146;t matter-&#147;

&#147;Do you?&#148;

Setsuna looked down:  &#147;Not always&#133;.  It could be an-&#147;

&#147;An enemy.  If it is they&#146;ll show themselves.&#148;

&#147;Or we have no future.&#148;

&#147;Maybe, or-&#147;

&#147;A punishment.&#148;

&#147;Or maybe, just maybe, fate&#146;s trying to get you not to worry-&#147;

&#147;It&#146;s my-&#147;

&#147;about the future.&#148;

&#147;We should ask Serena to leave.&#148;

Crash.

There stood Serena, a smashed bottle of orange juice on the floor.

&#147;Serena.&#148;

She turned and ran up to her room.

&#147;&#133;..&#148;

&#147;Go talk to her.&#148;

&#147;Michiru.&#148;

&#147;You made that mess you clean it up.  I&#146;ll clean this one up.&#148;

&#147;But-&#147;

Michiru gave her a look.

&#147;Sigh.&#148;

As Pluto went up the stairs she detransformed.

&#147;Serena?&#148;

&#147;Go away!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m coming in.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s fine!&#148;

Setsuna entered the room to see Serena packing.

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;m leaving.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t-&#147;

&#147;You don&#146;t want me here.   You hate me, don&#146;t you.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t hate you.&#148;

&#148;Yes you do.  You didn&#146;t want me here in the first place.  Sob&#148;:  
Serena threw herself onto the bed.

&#147;Not true.&#148;

&#147;Yes it is!&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;STOP LYING TO ME!&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148;

Yeah, nothing to say.&#148;:  Serena got up and resumed packing.

&#147;&#133;.  You&#133;.  You weren&#146;t supposed to stay here.&#148;

&#147;The truth finally.&#148;

&#147;It didn&#146;t happen.&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;This didn&#146;t happen.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m right here.&#148;

&#147;I..  Think what I&#146;m saying..&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148;

&#147;I shouldn&#146;t have even had said that.&#148;

&#147;Oh, that&#146;s&#133;&#148;:  Serean started packing faster.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.  Please.&#148;:  Setsuna stared to cry:  &#147;Think about what I&#146;m 
saying.&#148;

&#147;Hhhhn.  Didn&#146;t happen&#133;..  You mean, I didn&#146;t stay here.&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s what&#146;s had you so upset.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s.  I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

Serena stopped packing.:  &#147;Do you want me stay here?&#148;

&#147;I&#133;&#148;

&#147;Well?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t want you to leave angry.&#148;

&#147;I can accept that for now.  But, there&#146;s something you&#146;re not telling 
me.&#148;

Setsuna blanched:  &#147;I&#146;ll see you at dinner?&#148;

&#147;I need to think.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;Thank you princess.&#148;

&#147;Sigh.&#148;

A month slowly past, Setsuna , Serena and Hotaru spent a lot of time 
together.  Michiru and Haruka didn&#146;t mind.  It gave them more alone 
time.  One day Serena noticed Hotaru was a bit down.  She asked 
Setsuna if their was anything they could do.  Setsuna said no at 
first, but Serena melted her heart.  Later, Serena noticed Setsuna 
giving Hotaru a letter.  When she asked Setsuna said:

&#147;Don&#146;t ask, but now she&#146;ll be happier.&#148;

&#147;Fine.&#148;

Later on in bed Setsuna reflected:  &#145;I went to the future for her, I 
might&#146;ve altered the timeline.  I&#146;ve gotten too close.  The Queen, 
Serena&#146;s future self, she was there, right where I appeared.  She 
didn&#146;t invite me into the palace.  She didn&#146;t let me see Small Lady.  
I&#133;  Something&#146;s wrong.  I need to be alone to figure this out.  

Setsuna felt tears streaking down her face.

&#145;Why am I crying?&#146;:  She shook her head.  Then put her head down and 
after a while, fell to sleep.

The next morning:  &#147;I&#146;m leaving.&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;:  All four.

&#147;I need to figure things out alone.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna.&#148;:  Haruka.

&#147;Tell them Michiru.&#148;

&#147;About?&#148;

&#147;What I told you.&#148;

&#147;Why don&#146;t you tell them.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148;

&#147;Tell us what?&#148;:  Serena and Hotaru..  They giggled.

&#147;I can&#146;t&#133;  I can&#146;t see the future.&#148;

&#147;An enemy?&#148;:  Haruka.

&#147;&#133;.  The future.  I don&#146;t think so.&#148;

&#147;What about the future Setsuna?&#148;:  Serena

&#147;I&#133;  Never mind.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;:  Serena

&#147;Serena, Setsuna doesn&#146;t want to talk about it.&#148;  Hotaru.

&#147;&#133;..  It&#146;s safe, right?&#148;:  Serena

&#147;Yes.&#148;:  Setsuna.

&#147;And Renee?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s fine.&#148;

&#147;How do you know?&#148;:  Michiru.

&#147;She went there.&#148;:  Hotaru.

Setsuna looked at her.  Hotaru looked back.  They then disengaged.

Silence.

&#147;Why are you leaving then?&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;I just am.&#148;

&#147;Then I will too.&#148;:  Serena

Everyone at the table disagreed.

&#147;No, it&#146;s time.  You guys have really helped me.  But,&#133;.  I should 
go.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t have to.&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;Please stay.&#148;:  Michiru.

&#147;Serena.&#148;:  Hotaru.

&#147;My parents miss having me around, even Sammy almost said he missed 
me.&#148;

&#147;What do you say Setsuna?&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;She came here of her own free will.  She&#133;  It&#146;s her choice.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not like we won&#146;t see each other.&#148;

&#147;But I&#146;ll miss the morning wrestling matches.&#148;

&#147;Haruka.&#148;

&#147;And you&#146;ve got a good ear.  I sound better than ever.&#148;

&#147;Michiru.&#148;

Hotaru got up.  She went and hugged Serena:  &#147;You&#146;ve been like a 
sister to me.&#148;

Serena started tearing up:  &#147;C&#146;mon, I&#146;m not&#133;  I&#146;ll be around.&#148;

Silence.

&#147;When you going?&#148;:  Hotaru.

&#147;I&#146;ll see Setsuna off.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m leaving tomorrow morning.&#148;

&#147;There you go.&#148;

There was silence at the breakfast table as all thought their own 
thoughts.  Until, one by one, they left to go to their commitments.

In school it was lunchtime:  Serena and Molly were sitting under a 
tree.  Serena had finally spilled some of her troubles.

&#147;As for Darien, is he really worth it?&#148;

&#147;Hey!&#148;

&#147;C&#146;mon Ser, is he?&#148;

&#147;I&#133;.  I don&#146;t know anymore.&#148;

&#147;Something to think about.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Sorry,&#133;.  Y&#146;know, Setsuna&#133;.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Never mind.&#148;

&#147;What?!!&#148;

&#147;Okay, she made be afraid of you.&#148;

&#147;Of me&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Serena&#133;.  You&#146;re a kind and generous person-&#147;

&#147;Mol.&#148;

&#147;Let me finish.  You told me she had a hard life.  You, I don&#146;t know.  
You burn away the darkness.&#148;

&#147;Molly, c&#146;mon.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m serious, you&#146;re like a soft, pure light.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..  Yeah right.&#148;

&#147;Some people are afraid of light.  They&#146;ve been&#133;  They&#146;ve gotten used 
to things and you&#133;..&#148;

&#147;&#133;.  Molly.&#148;:  Serena shook her head.

&#147;You make things beatiful, your light reflects on the world.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#148;:  Serena blushed.

&#147;Maybe, she&#146;s afraid to see what the world really looks like.&#148;

&#147;Molly, you make me sound-&#147;

&#147;I have another question for you.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..Well?&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t get mad.&#148;

&#147;Molll.&#148;

&#147;Promise?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll try.&#148;

&#147;How do you feel about her?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s something you should think about.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s my friend and&#133;.   She&#146;s been there for me&#133;&#133;.&#148;

&#147;And?&#148;

&#147;And I&#133;.  Let&#146;s go to the arcade after school, okay?&#148;

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;Just, please&#133;  Drop it okay?&#148;

&#147;Arcade sounds great.&#148;

&#147;Cool.&#148;

Serena and Molly ate and talked.  Molly was glad Serena was with her.  
She knew she had had a fight with her other friends.  She felt bad 
about that.  But she was glad to have Serena being with her more:

&#145;I can try to help&#133;.  But, I&#146;m glad she&#146;s with me right now.  She&#146;ll 
figure it out.&#146;

Later that night, after Serena got back.

&#147;Your late.&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;They&#146;re waiting for you.&#148;

Serena went into the study.

&#147;Serena&#133;  You should have called&#148;:  Setsuna

&#147;You missed Dimensional Analysis.&#148;:  Hotaru.

&#147;Sorry.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s get to it.&#148;

Setsuna explained to Serena that Dimensional Analysis was where the 
unit measurements of the problem were made to match what the question 
asked for.  Once the measurements were the same for question and 
answer one could double check using it.

&#147;Cool.&#148;

&#147;Serena, shouldn&#146;t you call your folks.&#148;:  Hotaru.

&#147;I&#146;ll do that tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..  You have that physics book I lent you in your room?&#148;:  Setsuna

&#147;Yeah, But-&#147;

&#147;Get it please.&#148;

&#147;I can-&#147;

&#147;Now.&#148;

&#147;Daijobu.&#148;

Serena went and got the book.  When she came back down, she couldn&#146;t 
believe it.

&#147;A cake?!&#148;

&#147;We figure we&#146;d have a going away party.&#148;:  Haruka

&#147;Why not?&#148;:  Michiru.

&#147;You and Setsuna are leaving, so&#133;.&#148;:  Hotaru

&#147;Sorry, I was in on it too.&#148;:  Setsuna

&#147;You guys.&#148;:  Serena went over and hugged them

Haruka disengaged:  &#147;I&#146;ll get the food.&#148;

&#147;You mean we have to wait?&#148;

&#147;The cake will still be there.&#148;:  Michiru.

&#147;Yeah, but&#133;&#148;

&#147;One little piece.&#148;: Setsuna

&#147;yesss.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna.&#148;:  Haruka, Michiru, and Hotaru.

&#147;It&#146;s our party, I&#146;ll have a little piece too.&#148;

 Four facefaults.

&#147;Right.  I&#146;ll get the food.&#148;: Haruka left muttering about the world 
ending.

&#147;What did she-&#147;: Serena

&#147;Never mind.&#148;: Michiru.

Haruka came back with the food.  They ate and talked.  At midnight it 
started to end.

&#147;Michiru and Haruka left, saying something about working off the 
calories.  The others blushed a bit, even Setsuna.  Hotaru left next.  
Finally, it was Setsuna and Serena.

&#147;Setsuna, I wanted-&#147;

&#147;I&#146;m going to bed.&#148;

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;Good night.&#148;: Setsuna headed up the stairs.

&#147;Hold it.&#148;

&#147;We can talk in the morning.&#148;  

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Good night.&#148;: She was gone. 

&#145;Damn, it can&#146;t&#133;Hhhh.&#148;: Serena went to bed.

In bed, tears were streaking down her face: &#145;Why, why does-&#145;: Serena 
heard something: &#145;Am I hearing, doesn&#146;t matter.&#146;: She got up and left 
her room, she didn&#146;t know whether she heard or felt the crying.  She 
found herself at Setsuna&#146;s door.

&#145;She needs me&#146;: She opened the door.

&#147;Setsuna.&#148;

Silence.

&#147;I&#146;m coming in.&#148;

Silence.

Serena could now hear a muffled crying.

She turned on the light.

&#147;Go away.&#148;

There was Setsuna, Serena could see her tears.

&#147;We need to talk.&#148;

&#147;I said-&#147;

&#147;After midnight is morning.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148;

Serena moved towards the bed.

&#147;No.&#148;

She went to the chair.

&#147;You&#146;re going, I&#146;m going.  Nothing to say.&#148;

&#147;Where are you going?&#148;

&#147;Away.&#148;

&#147;For how long.&#148;

&#147;As long as it takes.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;  Fine&#133;.  Then I want you to know-&#147;

&#147;Don&#146;t say it.&#148;

Serena started to cry: &#147;I-&#147;

&#147;You WILL NOT TELL ME THAT!!!&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.  Let me ask you something.&#148;

&#147;Sigh, what?&#148;

&#147;What are we here for?&#148;

Setsuna shook her head

&#147;Answer me.&#148;:  Serena got up.

&#147;We&#146;re here to protect the planet.&#148;

&#147;&#133;.. Yes and no.&#148;

&#147;No?&#148;

&#147;We, we were given our lives to live.&#148;

Now Setsuna got up:  &#147;Our job-&#147;

&#147;Yes&#133;.  But we are here to do more than protect the planet.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;  We&#146;re here to&#133;.Let people be free.&#148;

Setsuna shook her head in confusion.

&#147;To allow them to choose.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#148;

&#147;When I healed the four sisters.  They still&#133;.  They still fought a 
little, but they loved each other.&#148;

&#147;Love?&#148;

&#147;They still had darkness in them.&#148;

&#147;No, when you heal you-&#147;

&#147;No, I don&#146;t brainwash people.&#148;

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;I just don&#146;t&#133;.  I help them to have a choice.&#148;

&#147;A&#133;.-&#147;

Serena started to cry:  &#147;We&#146;re here to let them choose their own 
destiny.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s wrong-&#147;

&#147;No.  The reason I fought Beryl, and the rest was so people could be 
free.  So they wouldn&#146;t be ruled by some tyrant.  So that they could 
forge their lives.&#148;.  Serena tears streaked down her face.

&#147;I fought for choice.  For love&#133;.  For the right to choose who to 
love-&#147;

&#147;No-&#147;

&#147;So people could be safe to choose, to be free.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t we deserve that Setsuna?

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t we have the right to forge our own destiny?&#148;

&#147;The future.&#148;: Setsuna was crying now too.

&#147;Then, then can&#146;t we have one moment.&#148;

&#147;One moment.&#148;

Serena came towards Setsuna.  She didn&#146;t back away.

&#147;Can&#146;t we have one moment where we are free?&#148;

&#147;One-&#147;

&#147;Moment.&#148;

They didn&#146;t know who kissed first, it didn&#146;t matter.  Serena put her 
arms around Setsuna.  She did the same.  They stood like that kissing.  
It seemed forever.  A beautiful moment in time.  Then:

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;Not yet.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Please.&#148;

Setsuna nodded

With a strength no one knew she had, Serena picked Setsuna up and lay 
her on the bed.

&#147;Serena!&#148;

Tears were streaking down Serena&#146;s face:   She looked at Setsuna, a 
plea in her eyes.  Setsuna understood.

&#147;We can have this night, it will-&#147;

Serena came towards her.  The discussion ended as they made that night 
their moment of freedom.

&#147;Time and again Pluto, that is how it mus be.&#148;

&#147;Yes my lord, time and what the hell?&#148;: Setsuna woke to find arms 
around her, the princess

&#145;What have I done? I&#146;ve-&#147;

There was a bright light and Setsuna found herself before the gates of 
time.  There she stood, her other self.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.  Why-&#147;

&#147;He&#146;s waiting.&#148;

The gates opened.  Setsuna looked at Pluto, eho stared straight ahead.  
With her head bowed and a heavy heart she walked in.  Bright light, 
she went to her knees, the light subsided.

&#147;My lord.&#148;

&#147;Sigh, get up.&#148;

She rose.

&#147;What is the first law of time?&#148;

&#147;Time is like an ocean.  New things rise, old things&#133;&#133;  My lord?&#148;

&#147;And closed cycles?&#148;

&#147;They must remain the same.  To ensure the flow of time.&#148;

&#147;But, what is the ultimate rule?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t-&#147;

&#147;Hhhh, all things&#133;.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..  Are you saying?&#148;

&#147;Answer the question!!!!&#148;

Setsuna thought for a moment:  &#147;All things change?&#148;

&#147;Ha ha ha ha ha.&#148;

&#147;I wondered how long it would take you to figure out that rule.&#148;

&#147;My lord?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not mad at you Setsuna, I brought you here so you wouldn&#146;t 
worry.&#148;

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;You saw the future was safe, correct?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Renee was born.&#148;

&#147;But, what about-&#147;

&#147;He has forged his own destiny&#133;.  Through his callousness.&#148;

&#147;You mean?&#148;

&#147;You may go.&#148;

&#147;Thank you.&#148;

&#147;Oh, and I want you to know, it wasn&#146;t a punishment.  They are 
returned.&#148;

&#147;You mean I can-&#147;

&#147;Yes hhh, ha hahah.  Go.&#148;

Setsuna wanted to ask what was so funny, but thought better of it.  
She went through the time gate.&#148;

She was back in Serena&#146;s arms.  Suddednly she saw herself and Neo 
Queen Serenity sitting around a table.

&#147;She&#146;s growing up so fast, isn&#146;t she?&#148;: NQS

&#147;Yes, our daughter.&#148;

&#147;One day-&#147;

&#147;I know how to stop your worries.&#148;

&#147;Setsumpphh.&#148;

Setsuna couldn&#146;t believe it, Renee, her&#133;  Pluto took Serenity&#146;s arm 
and pulled her up.  &#147;We have an hour.&#148;

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;It&#146;s enough.&#148;

Neo Queen Serenity sighed and leaned against her: &#147;More than enough.&#148;

They walked down the hall, Setsuna could see their faces, as she 
watched, Pluto winked at her.  Then she was back again.  She snuggled 
into the embrace.  There was on thing however that-

&#145;Don&#146;t worry about it.&#146;

&#145;Pluto?&#146;

&#145;We made a promise once to Chronos, look what that did.&#146;

&#145;Yes, but-&#145;

&#145;I hate to do this to you, but-&#145;

Setsuna saw a desolate land.  Nothing but ashes.

&#145;Was that?&#146;

&#145;A future where your lover loses hope.&#146;

&#145;You mean?&#146;

&#145;Chronos told me to tell you that a future built in love is never 
wrong.&#146;

&#145;&#133;&#133;.&#146;

&#145;Oh, and you should stop making love before midnight tomorrow night.;

&#145;Who said we were-&#145;

&#145;Trust me&#146;: Pluto was gone.

&#145;Sigh.&#146;

&#147;Setsuna.&#148;

&#147;Prin-&#147;

&#147;Sigh, can we?&#148;

&#147;I have something to-&#147;

&#147;It can wait.&#148;

Setsuna forgot her worries in the kiss.

The next night: &#147;I took care of it&#148;: Setsuna

&#147;You told them.&#148;

&#147;Haruka first.  She was upset at first, then happy for us.  Haruka and 
I told Michiru.  Then we told Hotaru.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..  You mean it&#146;s not over?&#148;

&#147;Do you-&#147;

&#147;I want you&#133;.  But.&#148;

&#147;The future and Renee are safe.&#148;

Serena rushed into Setsuna&#146;s arms.

They than looked at each other.  At the same time they said: &#147;What 
about-&#147;:They both laughed.

&#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148;: Serena.

&#147;Do you still-&#147;

&#147;Not as much as you.&#148;

&#147;Thank you.&#148;

&#147;But I&#146;m worried abmpph.&#148;

&#147;I know how to stop you worrying.&#148;

Serena blushed.  Setsuna looked at her and smiled, words weren&#146;t 
needed.

Beep. Beep Beep.

&#147;Uhhhh, what&#146;s that.&#148;: Serena

&#147;Time to finish. Huhn.&#148;

&#147;But, ohhhh yes, Yes, YESSSS!!!&#148;: Serena

&#147;Oh, huhn, that was great.&#148;: Serena

&#147;The, well, Hotaru&#146;s trying to sleep.&#148;

&#147;Sorry, but you&#146;re mmmm.&#148;

&#147;You too.&#148;

&#147;Why&#146;d we-&#147;

&#147;We&#146;ll see.  At midnight.&#148;

&#147;A surprise?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t know?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t see everything.&#148;

&#147;Hmmm.&#148;

They got themselves a snack, after finishing, they went back to bed.

&#147;It&#146;s 11:59 is-&#147;

The silver crystal&#146;s light filled the room. Before them stood Queen 
Serenity.

&#145;Serenity, what have you done?&#148;

&#147;Mother?&#148;

&#147;I demand you strip Pluto of her powers and choose a new Senshi.&#148;

&#147;My Queen&#148;: Setsuna

&#147;Be silent.  You have endangered the future.  Now, Serenity, do as-&#147;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;How dare you, I have-&#147;

&#147;I know.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148;

&#147;You sacrificed everything for us.  So we could be free&#133;.  Now you 
want me to sacrifice my love.&#148;

&#147;Your love is Endymion.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#148;

&#147;Why does it have to be Endymion.&#148;

&#147;Because&#133;..-&#147;

&#147;If I may speak?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ve done enough Pluto.&#148;

&#147;Even the condemned get their last words.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..Very well.&#148;

&#147;The future is safe, Serenity has an heir&#133;.  It is a beautiful 
future.&#148;

&#147;But, she must marry Endymion.&#148;

&#147;Why, mother?&#148;

&#147;Because&#133;.  You need protection.&#148;

Facefault by two:  &#147;My Queen-&#147;

&#147;Let me.&#148;

Setsuna nodded.

&#147;Mother, I have defeated Queen Beryl, Ann and Alan, and the Negamoon.  
After that, Pharoah 90, Nehelania and finally, Galaxia.&#148;

&#147;You had help.&#148;

&#147;Yes, my friends.&#148;

&#147;And Endymion.&#148;

&#147;Not for Pharoah 90, not&#133;.  Yes he has helped.  And I hope he will in 
the future&#133;..  But, I don&#146;t need his protection.&#148;

&#147;Hmpph.&#148;

&#145;Serena, use the Mind meld, I know you can do it..&#148;

&#147;Pluto?&#148;:  QS.

&#147;Let her show you.&#148;

&#147;Fine.&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;: Serena

&#147;What?!&#148;: Both

&#147;Mother, do you think I&#146;m that weak?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t-&#147;

&#147;I don&#146;t need someone who&#146;s always leaving me, who&#146;s never there, 
who&#133;&#133;  When I&#146;m with him, he&#146;s a million miles away&#133;.  T o stay with 
such a person would be weakness.&#148;

&#147;I&#133;.  It&#146;s our curse.&#148;

&#147;Then let me be the one to break it.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..You&#146;re stronger than I thought, perhaps&#133;Stronger than me.  Pluto, 
you haven&#146;t lied to me when I&#146;ve asked questions: Is she strong 
enough?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Sigh, you made a promise to me once Pluto.&#148;

&#147;I know.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll let my daughter decide how to punish you.&#148;

&#147;A promise?&#148;: Serena

&#147;You have no need of me anymore Serenity.&#148;

&#147;I will-&#147;

&#147;I wish to leave but.&#148;

&#147;There may be a way.&#148;: Setsuna

&#147;But mother-&#147;

&#147;I am trapped in this crystal, it would be nice to rest.&#148;

&#147;She wants to leave.&#148;

Tears streaked down Serena&#146;as face: &#147;Alright.&#148;

&#147;Take my hand.&#148;: Setsuna

They held hands.

&#147;Concentrate on our love and put it into the crystal.&#148;

&#147;But-&#147;

&#147;Serenity, be prepared to go.&#148;

&#147;Thank you.&#148;

Serena and Setsuna concentrated.  The crystal glowed.

&#147;I feel it.&#148;: QS.

Queen Serenity started to rise. A tendril of energy from the crystal 
attached to her.

&#147;Concentrate.&#148;

The tendril burst into flame.

&#147;Thank you.&#148;: Queen Serenity floated through the ceiling and was gone.

&#147;Tired.&#148;: Serena

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

They got into bed.

&#147;Good night.&#148;

Setsuna didn&#146;t say anything.

&#147;Daijobu? Setsuna.&#148;

&#147;Uhmm, you have another daughter in the future.&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;She has your eyes, or maybe your mother&#146;s.&#148;

&#147;You mean?&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll talk in the morning.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;ZZZ.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, how was it, need feedback.  When I get the chance I&#146;ll continue 
&#147;Am I too late?&#148;.  However, I&#146;m waiting for feedback.  Oh, go back and 
read the beginning again if you want.  I may type a sequel to this.  
Ja matta.
