<p>“<em>Connections,  huh?” Minako leaned over again, this time to whisper in Rei's ear,  “Is that all I am to you?” </em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly,  as inspiration hit the priestess, she broke into a smile and leaned  forward, kissing the idol on her ear. “Payback. And no, I hardly  think of you as a business connection. However, for the sake of  holding something over the heads of those little brats, it'd be nice  to have something other than my collection to show for it.”</em></p>
<p>Is bragging  rights any better than being used as a business connection? <em>Minako  smiled softly, leaning forward to rest her chin on Rei's shoulder.  “How many do you want?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Can I get one backstage  pass?”</em></p>
<p>Minako  blinked in surprise, leaning back to look at Rei, who was now  avoiding her gaze, scratching her cheek as if she had lost the  confidence that allowed her to ask the question in the first place.</p>
<p>“Just for you? Then  Usagi-chan and the others-”</p>
<p>“Don't.” Rei took a deep  breath and returned to looking at Minako, steadily keeping their eyes  locked on one another. “I... I want to see you... before you go  on.”</p>
<p>Minako  lost herself, just for a moment, in her opposite's eyes. To say they  were deep, would be a physical impossibility, but in the same breath,  there was something in them that made her heartbeat marginally  quicken. Her eyes started to close, but stopped halfway, that having  been enough to break the spell that bound her. She raised a delicate  eyebrow in dubious amusement. “See me? As in seeing me change into  my concert outfit? I had no idea you were so-”</p>
<p>“Th-that's not what I  meant!” In her sudden outburst of denial, Rei's precarious hand  that was propping her only slightly over Minako's thigh slipped,  causing her arm to coast away from her, crushed underneath Minako's  shoulder as she fell over the idol. She sighed warily, looking away  with a blush before trying to get up again. However, trapped was  trapped, and unless Minako let her arm go...</p>
<p>“This seems to have been  happening a lot lately, hasn't it? Since I got here?”</p>
<p>Rei  huffed, tugging her arm uselessly. Under her breath she muttered, “A  curse from Kami-sama for housing an idol in a sacred shrine.”</p>
<p>Minako  smiled at that. Pointedly putting a little pressure on the trapped  arm, she grinned. “I'll let you up if you answer. What would you  have to say to me that you can't do right now?”</p>
<p>Rei  still looked away. “You're already running late.”</p>
<p>“My manager is used to it-  and understands after I've been gone from Japan for so long. So tell  me.”</p>
<p>Rei  didn't move. “It's a... a good luck charm, of sorts. But it has to  be right before the event takes place.”</p>
<p>Minako  studied Rei's profile, wondering if she was trying to lie. She could  normally tell right off the bat, but this...</p>
<p>She  closed her eyes with a smile and sat up, sliding out from under the  shrine priestess. “That'll do, I suppose. Am I allowed to drop by  tonight? I won't ask to stay over; I should retrieve Artemis as  well... But after work, I can give you a special pass to get past my  security no matter where I am, for no matter how far into the  future.”</p>
<p>Rei's  eyes widened as she sat up, staring at her. “Y-you, are you sure?  If it happened to get stolen...”</p>
<p>Minako  grinned and winked. “I said it was special, didn't I? Don't worry  about that- I'll make it foolproof-secure.”</p>
<p>Rei  eyed her dubiously for a moment before closing her eyes. “I... I  suppose I'll trust your judgment on that then. I'll be at the shrine  for most of day and evening, so don't worry about not reaching me.  Don't overwork yourself, all right?”</p>
<p>Minako  nodded as they both stood up. “Yes, yes, I know. It's not a hard  routine; we already went over most of it before I flew over anyway.  It's just making sure I have the loose ends ready. Just tell me- how  many regular 'good' seats should I reserve? Usagi and everyone, if  they can make it, would be four... and I'm guessing your students  would be another four?”</p>
<p>Rei  scoffed and stuffed her hands into her large sleeves. “Those brats  don't need special attention. Yesterday morning was bad enough.”</p>
<p>Minako  scolded lightly, “Tsk, tsk, their teacher isn't one to talk, what  with the whole- MM!”</p>
<p>The  idol wrinkled her nose in disapproval as Rei clamped her hand over  her mouth. “Don't mention it! You'll jinx me somehow. Don't say a  word to <em>anyone</em> about that, all right? <em>Anyone.</em>”</p>
<p>Minako  sighed as she used both her hands to pry off Rei's. “<em>I</em> promise, but you know, I'm not the one you should worry about. Now <em>Usagi</em> would probably...”</p>
<p>Rei  bit her lip, turning away. “I'll take care of her later...”</p>
<p>“Don't go maiming any  princesses, old or new, now Rei-chan... okay, time to go.” Minako  nodded, as if to herself. “I'll see you later, all right,  Rei-chan?”</p>
<p>Rei  turned back and nodded as Minako stepped off and started heading  towards the entrance. “...Bye.”</p>
<p>-0-0-0-0—0-0—0-0-00-0-0-0-0—000-----</p>
<p><em>That  idiot! This one too! </em>Rei growled softly in the privacy of her  room. <em>I'm going to have her hide for this...</em></p>
<p>Rei  leaned back from her two boxes by the closet, one's contents being in  obviously better shape than the other. With a sigh, she stood up and  clapped her hands together to draw forth the necessary determination  for the 'problem' set before her. “Quarantine finished. Now then...  Where was my cleaner set...? I'm sure I left it on this shelf...  Geh.” Her fist clenched, eye twitching, as she looked upon the open  wreckage of her renovated first aid kit. Several bottles had somehow  leaked from the fall, mixing their un-salvageable fluids together.</p>
<p><em>Calm  down, Rei, calm down... Kami-sama knows you shouldn't loose your  cool... no matter </em>what <em>happens. Only bad things will happen if  I do...</em></p>
<p>Rei  started putting the containers, broken or not, into the kit they had  fallen from. After some rag-and-soap scrubbing did what it could to  remove not only the puddles but most of the smell from the mat, Rei  set about making a shopping list. Within fifteen minutes, the boxes  had been pushed back into the storage closet, and she was casually  dressed to go on a shopping errand. Naturally, she made sure to hook  the 'closed' rope into place at the entrance before leaving.</p>
<p>As  she walked down the lane, her thoughts began to wander, as they were  apt to do when idle for too long.</p>
<p><em>'I  swear I'm going to </em>kill <em>that airhead the next time she steps  anywhere </em>near <em>my room again... almost half of them... half!  Everything from cards, to CDs, to dolls...' </em>Rei clenched her  purse with a death grip. Before, of course, remembering to calm down  again. <em>'Breathe in... Breathe out... Bash her skull in... take the  guts out... NO! Bad Rei! Bad! Come on think of something else...  anything else... giving that idiot the time of thought is too much.'</em></p>
<p><em>--</em>I  need you in my life...--</p>
<p>Rei  stopped, as little memories of the last few days came back.</p>
<p>--My  manager said I could come to Japan only on the condition that it was  to rejuvenate my career by changing it into a... a duet.--</p>
<p>Rei  shook her head, steadily moving towards the train station. <em>'She's  insane if she thinks I'd actually agree to that.'</em></p>
<p>--Having  a partner to bounce chemistry off with, to interest fans. And who...  who better to reflect a sort of chemistry... than my dear old friend,  Rei?--</p>
<p>It  shouldn't have meant much of anything, being called that. 'Partner'.  But when she remembered that, for the most part, she and Minako had  never been such, when it counted... not when she was acting as the  Princess, throwing herself into caution and being swept away by the  wind; not when she was dying, and should have had someone right there  with her... though Rei would have come, if she had been told about  it...; not... if she thought about it, they'd never sung a duet  together, really. She had sung on the same stage as Minako, some  weeks later, they had saved each other from lesser enemies, sure,  but... But in the end... what was Minako thinking? Their styles were  completely different besides; not fit for the same stage, side by  side.</p>
<p>--<strong>If  that is what must be done, then you know what you must do.--</strong></p>
<p>Done...  what was there to be done? Minako would be leaving after her final  concert at the end of the week... and before that...</p>
<p>Rei  blinked and looked up, wondering how she had stepped onto the now  mobile train, with her thoughts so distracted.</p>
<p>She  sat down at an empty bench, idly watching the scenery pass by.</p>
<p>--My  manager might find me a different partner, someone I might grow to  like, but not likely immediately.--</p>
<p>That  meant... Minako already liked <em>her</em>. Well, that was obvious,  wasn't it? She wouldn't have gone to her, asking for help, if there  wasn't some compatible 'liking' between them.</p>
<p>--I  might choose to end this here and now... and stay near you... living  a relatively normal life.--</p>
<p>Rei  shook her head, lightly banging her head back against the window. <em>Stop it... Why are these thoughts... these words in particular...  suddenly coming back to me?</em></p>
<p>--As  long as I have a voice to sing with, and an audience to enjoy it, I  will sing.--</p>
<p>A  tangent memory linked this to a manga she owned in which some of the  main characters had sung themselves hoarse, to the point of never  being able to raise their voice, let alone sing, ever again.</p>
<p><em>I  will </em>not <em>let her die like that again. No matter what decisions  we make... I will </em>not <em>let that happen.</em></p>
<p>But  how did a shrine priestess protect an idol's health anyhow? Without  being by her side all the time...</p>
<p>--There  was a big accident so there's a lot of sudden patients...--</p>
<p>So  Amy had said... she had also elaborated that same night that the  hospital's reserves were nearly full and there was a rush to try to  find another hospital to hold them after they'd finished the initial  treatment. <em>But why that would suddenly pop up considering this  string of thoughts...</em></p>
<p>--If  nothing's here to hold me down, I'm not allowed to stay.--</p>
<p>The  train stopped, and Rei thoughtlessly stepped off.</p>
<p>Almost  like a zombie, Rei walked up the stairs, and was met by a news press  vendor.</p>
<p>She  stared unseeing at the mini-poster that met her gaze.</p>
<p>She  stared more, her eyes adjusting as she slowly started coming out of  her own little world.</p>
<p>She  grasped at the sheet... confusion became disbelief which was then  transformed into a form of conviction.</p>
<p>“That's it!” All the pieces fell together in her mind's eye,  as if she had solved a jigsaw puzzle with the guidance of Kami-sama  Himself. A slow smile of anticipation spread across her face.</p>
<p>That was when she, of course, chose to look up.</p>
<p>And recoiled, hastily looking left and right as if she were a  child who had realized her parents had disappeared at the fair.</p>
<p>After all, it couldn't have been <em>her</em> feet to take her in  front of this particular store, right?</p>
<p>Right. She offhandedly looked through  the window at the wares.</p>
<p>And then vigorously shook herself,  starting to turn away.</p>
<p><em>'How absurd! Who and why would I be giving any diamond jewelry  to?'</em></p>
