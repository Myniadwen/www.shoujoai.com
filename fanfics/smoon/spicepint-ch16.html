Usagi came to see us the next morning and congratulated Rei and me for 
finding our love again. Unfortunately she couldn&#39;t stay long because she 
had to catch the plane home (you can bet we had a little chat with the 
cab driver). Well, actually it was Rei who did the talking and then the 
woman had a &#39;chat&#39; with Usagi. If you could call it a chat that is-- 
they were yelling at each other the entire time.

I inwardly sighed at the memory from this morning. I swear those two can 
only get along by arguing.

I admit that I&#39;ll miss Usagi... but it won&#39;t be long before we&#39;re all 
together. Until then, Rei and me can hold down the fort here. Besides, 
it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to get bored anytime soon. A lot of things 
happened since our competition so we&#39;re keeping pretty busy. Like for 
instance, the two of us have gone back doing talk shows (also meaning 
that Rei has gone back to terrorizing our host, the poor woman).

Talk show

&quot;W-Welcome back,&quot; Our host nervously greeted us. I was smiling enough 
for both of us today since Rei had gone back to glaring. It was obvious 
that Rei knew what this person was going to ask us next (she is psychic) 
and it was also plainly obvious to me that the other woman wanted to 
avoid the topic more than anything else. I bet she&#39;s allergic to fan 
mail now. &quot;A-About your wedding...&quot;

&quot;No comment,&quot; Rei said immediately. &quot;Any other questions?&quot;

&quot;Now Rei-chan,&quot; I giggled. As I took one of her hands in mine I quickly 
glanced down at the two identical rings on both of our hands. &quot;Be nice.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m trying,&quot; Rei hissed back.

&quot;No, your not.&quot;

End of argument

&quot;All right, all right, I&#39;ll try harder!&quot;

With an amused expression I whispered something into Rei&#39;s ear and then 
sat back to watch her face instantly go bright red.

&quot;Sound good?&quot; I asked.

Rei weakly nodded.

&quot;Uh, let&#39;s hold off on the questions for a moment,&quot; Our host suggested. 
There was a relief in her voice for the break. &quot;I would like to say, 
since the competition performance your popularity has sky-rocketed! You 
two are among the top music artists worldwide! No one thought there was 
that kind of love between you two. And what a wonderful love it is!&quot; The 
woman quickly added when her eyes met Rei&#39;s. I had to nudge Rei again 
for that. &quot;Many of our fans never thought you&#39;d dare to proclaim your 
love on national television Hino san. That was quite admirable.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you,&quot; Rei said in a sweet voice with a smile and all.

There was a dead silence in the room. Everyone had froze upon seeing the 
sudden change in her attitude. Including me.

Ahahaha...Maybe you&#39;re overdoing it Rei... I elbowed her in the side.

But I&#39;m trying! And stop elbowing me! I swore I could hear her think 
back in the same sweet, innocent voice. Then I heard the snickering. She 
really was having fun with this wasn&#39;t she?

Finally regaining her voice our host commented, &quot;Umm... Considering your 
life and this newfound love, if you could explain it in a few words, 
what would it be Hino san?&quot;

A strange expression washed over Rei&#39;s face. I could tell she was being 
serious again. It was that look whenever she makes whenever she was 
about to give an honest, heart-felt response.

&quot;It&#39;s...C&#39;est la vie.&quot; I noticed how her eyes averted mine as soon as 
the words left her mouth.

&quot;Awww, Rei-chan you silly goof,&quot; I pulled her into an embrace where we 
both laughed in each other&#39;s arms.

--

Can you find the real me?
Somewhere here, dreaming somewhere, hurting everywhere

For a far off memory...

--

Even if it would take until my last breath,

I will find you, my love,

for the illusion is nothing.

But we are, we&#39;re something

--

If you believe in me, in us,

Then our eternity can be real.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

... And it is... because we&#39;ve found our eternity... together...
