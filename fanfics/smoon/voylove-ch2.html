<p>Why  Should I Trust You?</p>
<p>Rei abruptly  shoved away from the railing, effectively dislodging Mina from her  position and placing her roughly on the wooden deck. “What...  I don't know what you're talking about.”</p>
<p>Mina smiled  softly at that, quite aware of Rei's attempt at denial. “You <em>always</em> understand me, Rei.  We've been too close of friends for too long for us not to be able to  effectively know what the other is thinking, or trying to say. You  may not <em>like</em> everything I say, Rei-chan, but... you understand what it is that I  say. And for the most part, it goes the same for me.”</p>
<p>Rei's  gaze snapped to watching a school of flying fish swimming and jumping  alongside the ship, grasping at straws to find a change of subject.  “It's... it feels wrong... to have these feelings... We're  Senshi... we're... both female.”</p>
<p>Mina's smile  widened as she sat up. “If that's the best argument you can  provide... all I say is 'love is blind' and it just doesn't matter.”</p>
<p>The railings  hummed as the precarious grip on them shook with barely controlled  emotions. But before Rei could utter a reply, Mina was standing  beside her again, and whispering, “And I love you, too,  Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the  Senshi of Love had sworn never to lie when it came to the matters of  the heart... and she hadn't. Who else could give her the  appropriate, omniscient understanding, a shoulder to cry on when no  others knew the reason for her sadness? Who else, could relate to  the nerve wrecking reality of an extended life of a Senshi, and the  responsibility for protecting the Princess, as well as the civilians,  and her fellow teammates? Who else, had she told all her secrets to  as a best friend, assisted when there was simply no one else? Who  else but the Senshi of War and Passion, could completely win over the  Senshi of Love and Beauty? No one.</p>
<p>“Liar.”   The simple accusation brought Mina out of her lovesick reverie to  stare at Rei. Tears were burning their way down the priestess'  cheeks, marring the ever pale complexion. “You're just saying  that... so you can get me to agree to your piracy plan.”</p>
<p>At that moment,  Mina remembered why they had gotten to the subject of loves in the  first place, having forgotten in the 'heat of the moment' so to  speak. With a heavy sigh, she looked forlornly towards their  Kingdom. “I'm not lying. Rei, it's me you love, isn't it?”   When she received no reply, she continued, “How long? How  long have you known?”</p>
<p>Another lengthy  silence passed between them before Rei finally admitted, “Your  13th birthday. The speech you made about the...  intricacies of love. I recognized what I felt then, and it's only  grown stronger since.”</p>
<p>Mina nodded  slightly in acknowledged understanding. She'd made that speech more  to keep off the less serious of suitors, but that's not to say she  was unsatisfied with it having borne other fruit. “For me,  I've always known what love was, but I'll be honest; I also grew up  with the belief that I was meant to help others with love, but never  find it for myself. How then, could I call what I feel for my best  friend... love? I feel like we could be sisters, always at ends,  always looking out for each other, but we're more than that. You  know, on the week between our 18th birthdays, I took a  secret census of who the people thought were the most beautiful in  the Kingdom. Did you know? Even if I'm the Senshi of Beauty, <em>you</em> are the only one who surpassed me. What I mean to say is... maybe  you're right, in that I can't honestly love you like a male would-  but would you really want to be loved that way? You've never shown  any interest in any of your suitors, or dating at all. And  besides... you wouldn't want the one person who probably knows all  your secrets now, to slip away, would you?”</p>
<p>Under her breath, Rei grumbled, “Lovey dovey piece of...”  but Mina heard it and giggled lightly.</p>
<p>“Sorry, for that, I suppose. You know I never lie when it  comes to love though. And to be honest, I'd forgotten about the  thought of exchange until you mentioned it so...”</p>
<p>“Keep on forgetting it; it's a stupid idea.”</p>
<p>“But why Rei? Surely the only reason can't be that- erm...  what were the reasons again?”</p>
<p>Rei let out a partly aggravated, partly relieved sigh. “First  of all, you're a merchant's daughter. Pirates tend to pillage  merchant ships- so you're basically going against your father's  practice. Second, this crew is loyal to your Uncle, not you. I  doubt they'll go along with this half-baked scheme of yours. Third,  stealing is wrong, <em>especially</em> considering we're the private  guard for the Princess. If we're caught, there's no telling what the  verdict will be, but I assure you, it will be <em>bad</em>. Fourth,  I'm supposed to keep you out of trouble, and making you a pirate <em>definitely</em> goes against that. Fifth, piracy generally does <em>not</em> take only a week to really get a feel for- you'd probably  spend all seven days at sea and never meet another being during that  time. If you're late to your 21st ceremony, they'll  probably send search vessels out for us, and then you'll <em>really</em> be in trouble. Sixth, I doubt I could stand any more than a week  with you on a boat. Especially if you keep thinking up these bizarre  schemes.”</p>
<p>A long silence proved efficient to mark the end of Rei's tirade.  After gathering her thoughts, Mina took a deep breath and ranted  right back, “Well then, for the first part, since I'm using  piracy as a means of getting more money and experience, it's all  right. Second, for this week, my Uncle told the crew to do what I  said, as long as it was presented in a sensible enough way, which, if  you help me, I'm sure it won't be a problem. Third, we're not  stealing, exactly, just... collecting taxes. Yeah, collecting taxes  for the Royal Treasury. Fourth, if you <em>help</em> me, I won't get  into nearly as much trouble as if you <em>didn't</em>. Fifth, I don't  need a big fuss for this, even just one trip is fine with me, if we  can pull it off. Michiru-san told me this section was relatively  safe, but to still be on guard for pirates, so if we went out of our  way to meet them... Well, sixth, if you really love me, I don't  think you'd mind nearly as much as you say you do.”</p>
<p>Rei was rendered completely speechless for a number of minutes.  There was a bizarre sort of logic to Mina's words, the last really  getting to her. “As the leader, I expect you to take full  responsibility for any injuries, complaints, and consequences due to  this idiotic scheme. As for me... who am I to stand against our  Captain?”</p>
<p>Mina broke into a wide smile, realizing that Rei had finally given  in. “Thank you, Rei-chan. I promise, I won't let you regret  it.” As if to seal the deal, Mina leaned forward a placed a  soft, sensual kiss upon her expressed love's lips. After getting  over the shock, Rei began to return the favor, the passion of her  Senshi ego raising the heat of the her body, and their kiss.</p>
<p>When they finally broke apart, both faces were flushed, though Rei's  was much more evident. With the love still swirling in her cerulean  eyes, Mina giggled softly and whispered, “Now I know why you  have so many suitors. There's just something about the way you  kiss... mmm... I can't wait to see what else might happen if you  were to just follow your instincts all the way... Rei? Would it be  all right, if I said I wanted you all to myself?”</p>
<p>As she accepted the partial hug, Rei replied in kind, “I  already was. Now and forever, I'll love you, Mina.”</p>
<p>“Same here, Rei, same here.”</p>
<p>“SHIP AHOY! (Uhh... never been on a ship don't remember what  they say when another ship is sighted...)” From the nest high  on the mast came the call that startled the new couple out of their  embrace. “CAPTAIN! Pirates to the starboard side! What  should we do?”</p>
<p>At the malevolent, eager glint in Mina's eyes, Rei groaned. Not  bothering to answer her look, she walked over to the side of the ship  where she could get the best look at what they were being affronted  with. As Mina followed her, she heard the soft gasp come from the  priestess' lips.</p>
<p>“What, what is it? Ooh, that looks like such a nice ship...  wouldn't it be nice to take that one over for pirating? <em>That</em> crew probably knows what to do-”</p>
<p>“MINA! Don't you recognize that insignia? That's the  Zephyr! <em>The rogue Senshi Haruka's ship.</em> She's the most  feared pirate on the seven seas! It's said that there's been no  target she hasn't conquered, no allies ever harmed, and the longest  death toll for her adversaries among pirates! We're in trouble  Mina!”</p>
<p>Now it was Mina's turn to eye her friend dubiously. “You seem  to know an awful lot about them...”</p>
<p>At that, a thin sheen of fear covered Rei's eyes as she averted her  gaze. Her clenched fists would have drawn blood, if her nails had  been only a little more sharpened. “I knew Haruka... and  Makoto... since before I met you. I heard they were kidnapped by a pirate  ship when they were still children, and eventually, somehow managed to overthrow  the leader and become first rate pirates. They've never set foot in  the Kingdom since, but... once... you remember when I was supposed to  be visiting my grandfather after he had taken ill? They... they  conquered our ship... but when they recognized me, they agreed to let  me off the hook... until the next time we met. Mina I-”</p>
<p>“Hey, that's sounds like my plan! Well, somewhat modified  but... Ooh, you think we can take over their ship? If they were  allies... maybe they'll help?”</p>
<p>A hand went up to smack Rei's forehead. “Oh Kami-sama... what  did I ever do to deserve <em>this</em>?”</p>
<p>Mina paid no heed to Rei as she called out to the closest crewman,  “Put up the surrender flare- I want to meet these pirates.”</p>
<p>“MINA!”</p>
<p>Mina turned back to Rei and winked. “Aw, have a little heart.   These are fellow Senshi we're talking about, aren't they? I  remember them a little too. At least, when they were at the Kingdom.   I'm sure <em>they</em> would support my plan. And something tells me,  you don't have to worry about what they'll do in your case- I  promised to take all responsibility, didn't I?”</p>
<p>After  giving Rei a quick peck on the cheek, Mina stalked off to take  command, actually acting like a captain for once. With a soft sigh,  Rei headed for the captain's cabin, ready to write her entry in the  journal, knowing Mina would never get around to doing it. <em>“April  10, 1781: Today, our Captain, Minako Aino, decided that she and I  would lead a mutiny against her intended practice, her uncle, and the  entire Kingdom. Now, upon seeing the Zephyr, pirate ship commanded  by Haruka, Senshi of Wind, and Makoto, Senshi of Lightning, she seems  determined to, what I can only assume as, offer the both of us as new  recruits so that she can control a pirate ship for a week.  Kami-sama, this is definitely not how to keep out of trouble... what  kind of Senshi Leader </em>is<em> Minako Aino... my love?</em>”</p>
