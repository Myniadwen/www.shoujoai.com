<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 16 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>        The living room was nearly empty, only a large chair sitting 
over to one side. The curtains on the windows were new, the carpet on 
the floor having been pulled out and replaced. There was an odd feeling 
of sorrow in the room, a sense of grief and pain lingering in the air.

        Usagi walked into the dim room, her long blonde hair falling in 
two streams down her back. She knelt down in front of the window, laying 
the sheathed katana she carried across her knees. Softly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Mom, Dad, Sammy. I wish I had known....&quot;

        Her head bowed, Usagi let the painful memories run across her 
mind&#39;s eye. The attack on their home, the Youma breaking the front door 
down lead by the brown haired young man. Her father shoving her behind 
him, the splash of red as he was cut down. Luna cried out to her in 
alarm and Usagi ran for the stairs even as Mamoru was overwhelmed.

        &#39;No he wasn&#39;t,&#39; Usagi thought to herself bleakly, &#39;Mamoru went 
willingly.&#39; She had rushed back downstairs with her katana to find a few 
Youma lingering, the blood and the bodies. Seeing her mother and little 
brother laying there, the sightless eyes... she had snapped. Katana in 
hand she had cut them down, all the while wishing she had been able to 
do so before the attack.

        Usagi stood the blade up, resting the hilt against her cheek, 
drawing an odd sort of comfort from it as she forced herself back to the 
present. &quot;I just wanted to tell you,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I won&#39;t rest 
until I find them, until I avenge you. That bitch may have been my 
biological mother,&quot; Usagi&#39;s eyes flashed as she thought of Serenity, 
&quot;but you are my family.&quot;

        With that Usagi rose, the sword at her side as she paced into 
the small kitchen. She looked around her, smiling slightly at the 
different atmosphere in there. Makoto had made it her domain since she 
had come here, livening it up with bright colors and some delicate 
knick-nacks that were so out of character from the amazon.

        &#39;It&#39;s odd,&quot; Usagi mused as she pulled the covered plate from the 
dinner, &#39;this is the first night I&#39;ve been alone here in weeks, but I 
feel oddly relieved.&#39; Not that Usagi minded having Makoto here, but it 
was nice to be alone occasionally.

        With that, the doorbell rang into the silence. &quot;Never mind,&quot; 
Usagi muttered, sliding the plate into the microwave.

        Usagi left the food in there while she went to answer the door. 
Ami Mizuno smiled tentatively, &quot;Good evening, Usagi.&quot;

        &quot;Ami.&quot; Usagi blinked in surprise then said, &quot;What can I do for 
you?&quot;

        Surprisingly a faint blush touched the blue haired young 
professor&#39;s cheeks. &quot;I was hoping to talk to you about the Oni,&quot; Ami 
said, &quot;is Makoto home?&quot;

        Usagi fought back a smile. It was clear that Ami liked Makoto, 
but how deep that emotion went was hard to say. &quot;Come on in,&quot; she smiled 
slightly adding, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say that Makoto&#39;s gone out for the 
evening.&quot;

        &quot;Oh,&quot; Ami frowned slightly. She followed Usagi into the kitchen 
where she sat at the dining table and Usagi put the microwave on. &quot;Oh, 
you haven&#39;t ate? I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t realize...&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Usagi smiled, putting the kettle on for tea.

        There was the soft sound of paws hitting carpet as Luna came 
down the stairs. &quot;You should have woke me,&quot; the cat chided her gently. 
&quot;Good evening, Mizuno-sensei.&quot;

        &quot;Good evening,&quot; Ami smiled as the cat jumped onto a seat then up 
on the table. &quot;So,&quot; she asked both of them, &quot;what do you think of Sailor 
V?&quot;

        &quot;Minako you mean,&quot; Usagi pulled her hot dinner from the 
microwave, setting it on the table before getting the tea and a saucer 
of milk for Luna.

        &quot;I don&#39;t trust her,&quot; Luna said firmly.

        &quot;I do,&quot; Usagi sighed, digging into her food. She looked up at 
Ami, &quot;And you?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m reserving judgment until I have more information,&quot; Ami 
admitted with a smile, sipping at her cup of tea. &quot;My first impression 
of her wasn&#39;t good, but she&#39;s been here when we&#39;ve needed her,&quot; she 
calmly said.

        &quot;Just like a scholar,&quot; Luna noted, lapping at her milk.

        Usagi chuckled softly. &quot;I wish we knew what the Oni are 
planning,&quot; she frowned, chewing happily, &quot;we&#39;ve fought the Youma 
recently, but no signs of their masters.&quot;

        &quot;I think that most of the Oni have yet to awake,&quot; Luna offered, 
&quot;it&#39;s why the Youma are still working so hard to gather energy.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s a good working theory,&quot; Ami acknowledged. She frowned, 
drinking some of her tea, &quot;Do you know if it takes a certain amount of 
energy to awaken an Oni? Or for that matter how many of the Oni there 
actually are?&quot;

        Luna shook her head no, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

        &quot;The Youma have gotten away with some energy in our past few 
engagements,&quot; Usagi didn&#39;t look happy, &quot;I wonder if it was enough to 
awaken more Oni?&quot;

        &quot;No way to know,&quot; Ami shook her head grimly. She blushed 
slightly, &quot;I was wondering... where is Makoto tonight?&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know exactly,&quot; Usagi admitted, &quot;but I can probably 
guess.&quot; At Ami&#39;s curious look she elaborated, &quot;She&#39;s probably getting 
into a fight.&quot;

        ************

        Crack! The young man dropped like a stone, blood streaming from 
his nose. The others gathered around looked on in awe and a bit of fear 
at the young woman standing before them. Tall, strong, and beautiful her 
long brown hair flowed away from her face like as banner.

        &quot;I leave the neighborhood for awhile,&quot; Makoto said as she 
cracked her knuckles, &quot;and you all decide I&#39;m not coming back?&quot;

        &quot;You..&quot; the leader charged, lead pipe in hand...

        ...only to have an arrow knock the weapon out of his hand. She 
emerged from the shadows, long black hair framing a serious face. 
&quot;Pulling weapons in this sort of fight is so crude,&quot; Rei Hino said with 
a ghost of a smile, looking around the deserted lot.

        &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Makoto asked her, seemingly ignoring 
the young man who was running right at her. At the last moment she 
stepped aside and then stuck her led out, sending him sprawling to the 
ground.

        &quot;Usagi asked me to keep an eye on you,&quot; Rei said casually, the 
shrine maiden dressed in her traditional garb. There was a unusual aura 
around her, an almost supernatural presence, and the boys all seemed to 
feel it.

        Makoto blinked, then laughed, &quot;Yeah, I guess she would.&quot; She 
turned back to the young toughs and smiled, &quot;Take your best shot, guys.&quot;

        After some quiet whispering one of the young men stepped forward 
nervously to ask, &quot;Ah, are you part of a gang now, or something?&quot;

        Makoto chuckled softly, &quot;You could say that.&quot;

        &quot;And are they all as tough as she is?&quot; he nodded towards Rei.

        &quot;No,&quot; Makoto smiled to herself slightly, thinking of Usagi and 
Minako, &quot;some of them are even tougher.&quot;

        &quot;Hey!&quot; Rei protested.

        The young men exchanged nervous glances then, one by one, they 
left. &quot;Makoto-sama,&quot; the apparent leader actually bowed slightly, &quot;we 
don&#39;t need the grief that fighting you would cause. We give the district 
to you.&quot;

        Rei moved over to Makoto&#39;s side, putting her bow away smoothly. 
&quot;Did you just scare them off with a massive bluff?&quot; she asked curiously.

        Makoto flashed a smile, &quot;I wasn&#39;t bluffing.&quot; She hesitated a 
moment, studying the dark haired woman, then said, &quot;But thanks for the 
help.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Rei smiled back. The two of them walked to 
where a group of young women waited, looking at Makoto with pure 
admiration in their eyes. An admiration, Rei found herself noticing, 
that was extended to her.

        &quot;Thank you for all your help, Makoto-san,&quot; the girl beamed.

        &quot;Call my pager if there&#39;s any more trouble,&quot; Makoto smiled, 
taking an envelope from the girl, &quot;but I doubt they&#39;ll be back.&quot;

        &quot;We will,&quot; she beamed and Rei and Makoto walked away.

        &quot;You really do fight for money,&quot; Rei noted, the oddest look on 
her face.

        Makoto put the envelope away casually, not opening it to check 
what was inside it. &quot;My parents died ion a plane crash six years ago and 
left me nothing,&quot; she said calmly, &quot;I&#39;ve had to look out for myself 
since then.&quot;

        Rei&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

        &quot;Nothing to be sorry for,&quot; Makoto shrugged, &quot;just a fact of 
life.&quot;</pre>
