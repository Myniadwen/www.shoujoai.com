     Crow stretched out in the bath and tried hard to relax.  It wasn&#39;t
easy.  This had been far from the most inspiring day she had
experienced.
     She knew she was in for a rough time as soon as she woke up.  A
summons from Galaxia was never a good sign.  However, it hadn&#39;t really
been Crow that Galaxia wanted to see, but Siren.  As her partner, Crow
was expected to be there as well.
     Galaxia was angry.  That was nothing new, but it was even worse
than normal this time.  When she was in that sort of mood, it boded well
for nobody.
     Not surprisingly, the problem was Siren&#39;s inability to gather the
star seeds.  (Actually, given Siren&#39;s level of incompetence, Crow was
surprised it had taken this long for Galaxia to take notice.  But she
wasn&#39;t about to mention that.)  But as Galaxia continued to berate
Siren, Crow apparently suffered a temporary loss of judgement, and
jumped in to defend her partner.
     Big mistake.  If it was risky to contradict Galaxia on a good day,
it was nothing short of suicidal to do it when she was already mad.  Now
the queen was royally pissed at both of them.  Crow would probably never
know what came over her that day.  Pity, she supposed.  She couldn&#39;t
stand to see Siren under attack like--
     Crow frowned.  Like what?  What did that remind her of?  Why did
she have such a strong feeling of dej&aacute; vu?
     Whatever it was, it was gone now.  Taking a deep breath, Crow
ducked her head under the hot water.  After several seconds she
straightened up and shook her head violently.  Glittering droplets flew
from her hair and fell like a gentle rain on the blue and green tiles of
the bathroom.  The water was filled with a delicious blend of salts and
fragrances that she had always found wonderfully relaxing.  The
birdbath, Siren had called it once.
     For the first time that night, Crow felt a smile touch the corners
of her mouth.  It was a fitting appellation, she had to admit.  But even
this couldn&#39;t do the job today.  She was still tense, and maybe even a
little . . . apprehensive.
     She was worried, Crow realized.  Siren might be a useless
nincompoop and a constant thorn, but she was her thorn.  And she
certainly didn&#39;t deserve to share Iron Mouse&#39;s fate.  But that was
exactly what would happen if she didn&#39;t shape up.
     Crow closed her eyes as memories of the day&#39;s events washed over
her.  When they set out on the assignment, she had tried to convince
Siren to get it together, and take her job more seriously.  Siren had
barely even noticed, so engrossed was she in her snack.  Once she
finally did pay attention, she did at least promise that she would get
the star seed.  But, of all idiotic things, she said she would do it--
for Crow!
     &quot;As if I needed it,&quot; Crow muttered.  &quot;She had better do it for
Galaxia if she wants to live.&quot;
     Whether for Galaxia or for Crow, Siren still couldn&#39;t seem to pull
it off.  Once again, Crow wound up finding the star seed for her.  When
that one turned out to be yet another blank, Crow left, certain that her
partner would also retreat.  With the mission another failure, it would
take an absolute idiot to stay and risk a battle with Earth&#39;s warriors.
     Siren attacked Sailor Moon.  Not only did the melee culminate with
her being hopelessly outnumbered, but as a result of the fight, Sailor
Moon managed to learn a new, even more powerful technique!  Siren&#39;s
failure had served no purpose save to make their enemy stronger.
     Galaxia was displeased.
     They would be summoned to appear before the queen again the next
morning.  Naturally, Crow&#39;s partner was unconcerned.  But Crow knew it
was trouble.  Siren&#39;s failures had almost exhausted Galaxia&#39;s less-than-
legendary patience.
     There was only one thing to do.  Crow would have to talk to her
partner, try to make her realize the desperate situation she was in.
Otherwise, Siren would . . .
     Crow shook the thought out of her mind.  Rising slowly to her feet,
she stepped out of the bath and plucked a towel from the rack to wrap
around herself.  She had best get it started if she wanted to get it
done.  Somehow, she had a hunch that it wouldn&#39;t be easy.

                             *     *     *

     Crow watched as Siren&#39;s wondering expression changed swiftly to a
look of surprise and thence to a broad smile as she opened the door in
response to Crow&#39;s knock.
     &quot;Crow-san!  How wonderful!&quot; she exclaimed, practically dragging her
visitor into her suite of rooms.  &quot;Please, sit down.  I&#39;ll get some
tea.&quot;
     &quot;Siren, I really can&#39;t--&quot;  Crow realized that Siren was too excited
over her visit to pay much attention at that moment.  Heaving a resigned
sigh, she lowered herself into an ugly red armchair that didn&#39;t come
close to blending with the rest of the tasteless decor.  &quot;Huh,&quot; she said
to herself as she sank into the cushions, &quot;this furniture may be tacky
as hell, but it sure is comfortable.&quot;
     After a few minutes, the hostess returned with a tray of tea, and
happily proceeded to pour a cup for Crow.  &quot;I&#39;m so glad you came!  I
can&#39;t even remember the last time you came in for a visit.&quot;
     Setting down her cup, Crow began again.  &quot;Siren, I--&quot;
     &quot;Oh, that&#39;s right!&quot;  Once again Crow&#39;s words were lost to empty air
as Siren hurried from the room.  A moment later, she reappeared, holding
a large plate of cookies.  &quot;Try one of these!  I just baked them this
evening.&quot;
     Numbly, helplessly, Crow took one of the cookies and bit into it.
Her eyebrows rose in unwilling surprise.  &quot;These are good,&quot; she
admitted.
     &quot;Oh, do you really like them?  It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve tried a
recipe like this.  It actually uses molasses instead of sugar, and
also--&quot;
     &quot;STOP!&quot;
     Startled, Siren ceased her happy babbling as Crow jumped up from
the chair.  &quot;Crow-san, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;
     &quot;You, that&#39;s what!  Don&#39;t you ever learn anything?  Galaxia is
furious!  If you don&#39;t start producing, you&#39;ll wind up joining Mouse!
And here you are, wasting your time making cookies!  Don&#39;t you realize
what kind of a situation you&#39;re in?&quot;
     &quot;Yes, I understand perfectly.  And if I choose to spend possibly my
last free moments baking, that&#39;s my choice, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
     &quot;You imbecile!  If you actually worked at it, you might be able to
find the star seeds.  I know you&#39;ve got talent, why don&#39;t you use it?&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Crow-san.  I&#39;ll get the seeds.&quot;
     &quot;How can you be so sure?  This may be your last chance.  You&#39;ve got
to start applying yourself!&quot;
     &quot;Why?&quot;
     The simple question caught Crow completely off guard.  &quot;&#39;W-why&#39;?
Are you crazy?  Do you want to be killed!?&quot;
     &quot;Of course not.  But why do you care?&quot;
     Taken aback, Crow could not speak for several seconds.  Siren
leveled her gaze on Crow, a shrewd gleam in her eye that surprised Crow
and left her more than a little disconcerted.
     &quot;It&#39;s no secret that you feel I&#39;m always holding you back.  You
could easily be rid of me.  And then you could be acting on your own,
without me slowing you down, and accomplishing everything you tried.  So
why are you trying to make sure I live?&quot;
     &quot;I . . . &quot;  Crow&#39;s voice faltered.
     &quot;For that matter, you could have gotten rid of me long ago just by
not helping me.  You&#39;re always coming to the rescue when I&#39;m having
trouble, even though it would be easier to do nothing.  Why?&quot;
     &quot;Siren, it&#39;s not . . . &quot;
     &quot;If you just wanted to get the job done, you could do it faster
yourself.  Instead you take the time to help me with it, so that I can
be the one to complete the mission.  Why?&quot; she asked for the third time.
     &quot;It&#39;s just . . . Siren, no one deserves to be killed like that.
Not you, not anyone.&quot;
     &quot;You didn&#39;t seem too distressed when Mouse was killed,&quot; Siren
observed.  &quot;And you&#39;ve never cared about the enemies you destroyed.  Why
does it matter so much what happens to me?&quot;
     &quot;You don&#39;t . . . You&#39;re my partner, and--&quot;
     &quot;Is that why you tried to defend me from Galaxia this morning?&quot;
Siren interrupted.  &quot;You knew that it wouldn&#39;t do any good, and would
only make her mad at you.  But still you tried to help me.  Why did you
do that, Crow-san?&quot;
     &quot;Siren . . . &quot;  Crow had no idea what to do.  She had never seen
Siren this way, never found herself unable to answer so many questions.
And she had no idea what her partner would do next.  Continue her
Socratic questioning?  Reveal a master plan to find all the star seeds?
Offer Crow a danish?  For once finding herself helpless before her
partner, Crow waited uneasily to see what Siren would do next.  At this
point, she would have expected almost anything.
     She most certainly did not expect Siren to step forward and kiss
her.
     And she really did not expect to find herself responding.
     Tea and cookies long since forgotten, Crow slowly reached up and
lightly touched Siren&#39;s cheek.  She could feel Siren pressing close,
never relinquishing the kiss.  Gently, she lowered her hand to Siren&#39;s
shoulder.
     And shoved.  Hard.
     Siren landed with a thud that Crow could feel in her own teeth.
But she was beyond caring.  &quot;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing!?&quot;
she spat at the figure that cowered on the floor.
     &quot;Crow-san?  I--I thought . . . &quot;
     &quot;No, you didn&#39;t!  You never think!  I can&#39;t believe even you would
do something like that!&quot;  Crow&#39;s voice lowered to a menacing growl.
&quot;You&#39;re no partner of mine.&quot;  With that, she spun on her heel and
marched out the door, her every movement followed by Siren&#39;s anguished
face.

                             *     *     *

     Crow curled into as small a space as she could.  Huddled in her
bed, blanket thrown completely over her head, she tried desperately to
hide from the eyes.
     There was no refuge.  Light or dark, it made no difference.
Wherever she looked, wherever she didn&#39;t, she could only see one thing.
She was haunted by the eyes.
     Siren&#39;s eyes continued to stare at her.  Brimming with unshed
tears, filled with pain, confusion, anguish, betrayal--Crow&#39;s betrayal--
they assaulted her relentlessly.  Hiding was useless.  Crow&#39;s
only hope was to fight back.
     &quot;She had it coming!&quot; Crow told herself vehemently.  &quot;What did she
think she was doing, kissing me like that?  Honestly!  We&#39;re both women!
She deserved no better than what she got.
     &quot;And where the hell did she get the idea that I liked her?  I can&#39;t
stand that dimwit!  I&#39;d die before I&#39;d ever even be friends with her!  I
could never love someone like that, I could never love a woman!  I could
never . . . love . . . &quot;
     Crow could still taste their kiss.  She shoved the memory aside,
determined to ignore it, determined to ignore the strange, yet strangely
familiar warmth she had felt then.  Something subtle, deep within her--
another elusive memory, and one best set aside.  A trickle of moisture
rolled down her nose.  Telling herself that it was only sweat, that it
was hot under the blanket, she hastily wiped it away.
     The eyes pressed forward.  Gathering herself, Crow rallied.
     &quot;She should never have done that.  No one in their right mind would
act like that.  She&#39;s a drain on everyone and everything.  I&#39;d be better
off without her!&quot;
     At that, she froze.  Tomorrow would be Siren&#39;s last chance.  There
would be no forgiveness, no additional opportunities.  If she failed,
Galaxia would kill her.
     In all her battles, Crow had never experienced this.  She had seen
it in the faces of a thousand enemies, but had never known it herself.
Now she felt it in its full strength--pure, cold fear.  Not even she was
safe from Galaxia&#39;s terror.
     Several more droplets followed the path of the first.  &quot;Why did you
have to do that, Siren?&quot; Crow whispered.  No answer was forthcoming from
the silence.  Squeezing her eyes closed, wrapping the blanket tightly
around herself, she tried in vain to shut out the eyes that pierced her
soul.
