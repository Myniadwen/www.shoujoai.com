<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 21 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><p><u>(Later, Minako, Shuttle room)</u></p><p>Venus Minako found herself alone in her new 
shuttle room. The place was fairly quiet-- only the sounds of circulating air could be heard 
in the background. It was too quiet for Minako’s liking; the Goddess paced around for a 
moment, stopping in front of the desk, briefly tapping her fingers on the chair, before she 
sighed and walked over to the window to gaze out of it.</p><p><i>There are so many stars out 
here...</i> She thought to herself as she leaned onto the window’s ledge. <i>I wonder how 
Rei’s doing right now. </i></p><p>She paused, half-expecting to hear a sharp retort any 
second. But when she didn’t hear anything, she sighed again.</p><p><i>I haven’t heard 
anything from her in awhile. Did we lose the connection because of the distance? </i>She was 
disappointed, but, inside, she also, strangely, felt like a part of her was 
relieved.</p><p>“Hah. Oh well. I guess... that’s just how it goes sometimes.” She tried to 
smile, but in her reflection she could see past her own facade. The smile was there, but 
there was sadness in her eyes.</p><p>Minako pressed one hand to the glass and felt its 
coolness under her fingertips. She couldn’t get their parting on Pluto out of her 
head.</p><p><i>I almost kissed her again... </i>It nearly happened after they had left Venus 
and now it nearly happened on Pluto as well. She was disappointed, but in 
herself.</p><p>“What was I thinking…?”</p><p><i>Isn’t this why this tragedy happened in the 
first place? My family and all of those people who died for us...! They’re all dead now 
because...because... </i>“...Of me.”</p><p>The woman felt her chest tighten painfully. It 
wasn’t fair.</p><p><i>If only I had been strong enough to defeat it. I know what I saw. That 
aura that I sensed in the Queen’s Chamber...There was so much bloodlust in it. And his 
laughter! </i>It was so very vivid in her memory that it almost brought her to shiver. 
<i>There’s no doubt about it. That power belonged to a God, and there’s only one God who’s 
missing amongst us. </i></p><p><i>Ares.</i></p><p><i>Ares killed my family. </i>Minako 
concluded with certainty. However, along with that certainty was another uncertainty of its 
own; one that she could not stop herself from thinking before it reached her 
consciousness.</p><p><i>And Rei... is Ares’s heir. </i>Her blue eyes widened at the 
implication. “No, what on Venus am I thinking? Rei wasn’t the one who murdered them! She’s 
nothing like Ares… She’s better than that murderer; she’s kind and caring.”</p><p><i>She 
saved me...</i></p><p><i>She’s my friend!</i></p><p><i>... But still. Oh, I don’t know! 
</i>The blonde woman gave out a small, frustrated sigh. There was just so much to consider. 
<i>She said that we were friends, so... she couldn’t ever like me in that way, could she? 
The only reason she lets me get away with ‘it’ is because she thinks it’s a Venusian 
tradition. </i>It was the only reason Rei let her that close. She did feel a bit guilty 
about it. <i>But, even if she ever did fall for me someday...things are different now. I’m 
no longer the same person that I used to be. I have a lot more responsibilities now! Can I 
really forsake my duties just because I’m in love? </i></p><p><i>I’m the only survivor of my 
family. Mother said that I was supposed to succeed her... And it’s true, my body feels so 
different. I’m really a Goddess now. A true Goddess. But...why am I still running away? 
Because of my weakness, Taya is stuck with the huge mess that I left behind! Everyone is 
undoubtedly struggling at home. There was just, so much destruction... </i></p><p>It wasn’t 
fair.</p><p><i>While they’re all hurting, I’m thinking about myself. It feels like, I’m 
betraying everyone for being like this, for liking her... It’s not right. It’s incredibly 
selfish of me, isn’t it...?</i></p><p>The blonde took in a deep, shaky breath, trying to 
calm her guilty heart. There seemed to be no way out of it. She was cornered, chained by 
this false newly acquired freedom.</p><p><i>I’m a terrible person.</i></p><p>Someone outside 
knocked on her door.</p><p>“Come in.” The door slid open and she could see that it was 
Haruka.</p><p>“Hey. I hope I’m not disturbing anything, but we’re all meeting in the bridge 
right now. Can you come?”</p><p><u>(Minako, Bridge)</u></p><p>Soon they were all in the 
bridge. Makoto, Ami, Haruka and Michiru were all grouped around the center table. They were 
all actively discussing their plans for their mission. It was an ongoing cycle that appeared 
almost comical to the mute Venusian: Haruka would suggest something and then Makoto would 
agree. Then the idea would be quickly shot down by Ami and Michiru’s logical/analytical 
reasoning. Normally Minako would have laughed at their silliness, at how they argued with 
one another over a dead point. Normally she would have said something that was even more 
ridiculous than the argued suggestion, but not this time. She was still trying to wrap her 
thoughts around the seriousness of their situation--of what her goal was 
now.</p><p><i>That’s right. We’re in a war right now… We have to find Hotaru’s heart. We 
have to win! Otherwise... countless of people will continue to die. I don’t want that. I 
don’t want anyone else to be sad. </i>Her hands tensed in her lap. <i>I have to find 
Hotaru’s heart, no matter what the cost… I have to do everything I can to help end this war. 
I have to concentrate…only on…</i></p><p>Minako scanned the faces around the table and found 
herself once again envious of her friends. It was no longer their difference in strength or 
the issue of them being the chosen heirs that would lead their people-- she was envious of 
their happiness. Each and every one of them was a great and experienced leader. But, more 
importantly:</p><p><i>They can love whoever they want to love. I’m a bit envious of 
them.</i></p><p>Minako was not naïve as she once was, and it saddened her. Being ignorant 
wasn’t this painful.</p><p><b>“</b><i><b>Mina, is something wrong?”</b></i></p><p>The voice 
caught the blonde woman off guard, momentarily startling her. Did she hear what she thought 
she had just heard?</p><p>“…<i>Rei? Is that you?”</i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>No. This is just 
the random voice in your head and you’re going insane. Of course it’s me! Who else would it 
be?”</b></i></p><p>“<i>Wow, someone’s cranky.”</i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>I heard 
that.”</b></i></p><p>“<i>Hey... I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just...you never called me 
that before. It made me really happy.”</i></p><p>“<i><b>...”</b></i></p><p>“<i>So, where 
were you? You just stopped talking for awhile there. I was getting a bit 
worried.”</i></p><p><i><b>"</b></i><i><b>I didn’t mean to make you worry. I didn’t say 
anything for awhile because I was trying to keep track of your presence. It’s just... this 
distance. As the distance between us increases, it becomes harder to maintain the 
connection. But it’s nothing to worry about. It won’t break. It just means that when we talk 
to each other, you have to consciously want to.”</b></i></p><p>“<i>Oh, I see. So instead of 
automatically hearing my every thought, you’ll only hear what I want you 
to.”</i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>Yes, exactly.”</b></i></p><p><i>Heh, I kind of like that 
idea.</i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>It works vice versa as 
well.”</b></i></p><p><i>Darn...</i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>But even if you don’t talk to me, 
I’ll still be able to sense your thoughts. Like just now, it felt like something was 
troubling you. Is there something on your mind?” </b></i></p><p>Now that Rei had mentioned 
it, she could detect the small bit of warmth mixed in with her aura. It was just fainter, 
that’s all.</p><p><i>She still cares about me. </i>It dug the guilt in 
further.</p><p>“<i>I’m fine Rei. Really.”</i></p><p>Before Rei could protest, someone else 
had noticed the blonde’s strange behaviour.</p><p>“Minako?” Ami asked.</p><p>“Huh?” The 
woman’s head shot up to see the rest of her company watching her intently.</p><p>“Is there 
something wrong?”</p><p>“What? O-Oh no! It’s nothing really!” She laughed. However, this 
time it wasn’t very convincing. “Umm...Why do you ask?”</p><p>“Well, you haven’t said a 
single word since you got here,” Makoto gently pointed out. “We were wondering if you were 
feeling okay.”</p><p>“Well...”</p><p>“Yes, if there is something on your mind… we would be 
more than happy to listen if you wish to talk about it,” Michiru offered.</p><p>Their 
kindness touched her, really. However, it was making the Venusian feel bad.</p><p><i>Look at 
me. I’m worrying everyone again…</i></p><p>“I’m sorry guys. I’m fine, really. I guess...I’m 
still trying to wrap my head around everything. It’s kinda a lot to take in.”</p><p>“Yeah, I 
can’t argue with you there.” Haruka quipped.</p><p>“Anyway, so what were you saying?” Minako 
quickly changed the topic.</p><p>“Hm? Oh… Well, we were just discussing the terrain 
conditions on Saturn,” Haruka filled in. “Just speaking from experience, it’s brutal. 
There’s no other way of putting it. The land there is cold and barren, and there’s purple 
smog everywhere! There no way a normal person could possibly survive it. I mean, we were 
lucky as it was. At first, I couldn’t help but wonder if Michiru had somehow gotten the 
reading wrong, that the key—I mean… that Hotaru was there. You see, when we first started 
looking for her we weren’t even sure of what to look for. We never imagined that it would 
look like a kid, or that it could possibly exist on a place like that.”</p><p>“So, then how 
did you find Hotaru? Wouldn’t her heart be near where you found her?” Minako 
reasoned.</p><p>“We were just wondering about that too,” Makoto agreed.</p><p>“Yes, it would 
be the most logical place to look first.” Ami nodded.</p><p>“Normally that would be the 
case,” Michiru said slowly. “However, we were not the ones to find Hotaru. She found 
us.”</p><p>“…Okay. So what you’re saying is that we have some serious searching ahead of us. 
But there’s no way we can search the entire planet, especially with our time crunch.” Makoto 
followed up.</p><p>Minako saw the corners of Haruka’s mouth tug upward. “Hm? Well, you look 
confident about something. Do you have a plan?”</p><p>“It’s all taken care of.” Haruka 
admitted with a nod. “Our ship’s computers have already minimized our search to one area. 
Granted, it still might take awhile... but then again it might not. Who knows? It’s all 
we’ve got though. Did Rei get all of that?”</p><p>“<i>Rei…?”</i></p><p><b>“…</b><i><b>Yes, I 
did.”</b></i></p><p>“She did.” Minako confirmed.</p><p>“All right then,” Uranus yawned and 
stretched her arms. “I don’t know about you guys, but I think there’s no point in worrying 
about it right now. Until we get to Saturn I think we all should get some rest. Do 
everything you need to do now… you know, eat, sleep, think... go to the bathroom, whatever… 
just get it done because Saturn is a hell of a dangerous place.” Haruka yawned again 
sleepily. “Hmm… I sure could use a nap.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence and odd stares; 
the ‘supreme warrior of wind’ looked like she was about to pass out. How could she be so 
relaxed?</p><p>Groggily the shorthaired blonde walked past her friends and paused at the 
doorway.</p><p>“Get some rest.” She turned her head and shocked the group with suddenly 
intense green eyes. “Got it?”</p><p>“Mm.” The others nodded.</p><p><u>(Rei, 
Pluto)</u></p><p>“What is the status of their progress?”</p><p>Rei opened her eyes to mere 
slits, only enough to stare at the familiar back. In front of her Setsuna had taken a 
position to maintain Hotaru’s barrier. She was holding her staff vertically upright in the 
air with both hands in front of her; the reflective jewel at its end was glowing 
brightly.</p><p>“They are closing in on Saturn.” Rei reluctantly replied. A bead of 
perspiration finally broke loose and ran down her the side of her cheek. The Martian’s 
entire face was flush as it was when Minako had left her earlier. For the last five hours, 
at least, she had stood upright, legs shoulder width apart, with her hands interlocked in 
symbolic meditation.</p><p>Setsuna carefully peered over one shoulder, cautious not to break 
the bond that she held, to briefly inspect her sole companion.</p><p>“You... are 
struggling.”</p><p>Rei was taken aback by the blunt comment. It was rare for someone to be 
so forward with her, but she supposed it wasn’t impossible if the individual was a silent 
snob.</p><p>“I never asked for your opinion!” She retorted. When Setsuna said nothing, Rei 
growled, “Would you please stop staring like that? Look, I’m fine, okay?! Do you want to 
know their ‘progress’ or not?”</p><p>“Is that your true motivation? To act as a line of 
communication for someone such as myself?”</p><p><i>What? </i>The raven-haired woman’s eyes 
widened further, so fast, that she almost lost the connection.</p><p>“To reach across the 
universe with one’s soul, one must first possess an amazing spiritual gift… A gift with the 
strength to reach across time and space despite the distance, its heavy burden. As the soul 
ventures forth and embarks on a journey outside the limits of the physical, the connection 
to the body wavers. Do you not feel such a strain…?” Crimson eyes met intense amethyst. “The 
distance will continue grow. Can you maintain your balance, and not fall along the 
way?”</p><p>“I told you, I’m fine.” Rei repeated sternly. <i>What on Mars is she going on 
about now? </i>She had no patience or concentration to spare for deciphering the cryptic 
sayings of a stranger she had only met. “If anything, I think you should be worrying about 
yourself first. If that barrier goes, then we’ll both be in trouble.”</p><p>Setsuna returned 
her gaze to her charge, leaving the Martian to concentrate.</p><p><i>Heh. Potential indeed… 
</i>The former advisor contemplated in a rare moment of amusement. Although her companion 
was struggling to uphold her pose, the woman’s aura had not decreased one bit since the 
group had left. Her energy still burned strong. However, Setsuna’s own…</p><p>Setsuna felt 
the burden continue to build steadily upon her shoulders. It has been some time now since 
she had initiated the barrier. Even she was aware that she was not immune to physical 
exhaustion.</p><p><i>Please return quickly…</i></p><p>“They’re there.” Rei’s voice rang 
out.</p><p><u>(Minako, Saturn)</u></p><p>“We’re here.” Haruka announced as the shuttle door 
extended to the barren ground below. “Be careful to watch your step. The smog looks even 
thicker than the last time we came here.”</p><p>One by one the group descended down the 
metal steps, their footsteps clanging loudly until they reached the planet’s dirt surface. 
It was just as Haruka and Michiru had promised—there was a thick fog that shrouded the 
entire area. It pooled the most heavily along the ground, but there was enough of it in the 
air to terribly diminish their vision and make it difficult to breath.</p><p>Almost 
immediately Makoto, Ami and Minako all coughed violently in reaction to the 
mist.</p><p>“O-Oh dear...” Ami squeaked. Her blue eyes were beginning to water. Makoto 
wasn’t fairing much better.</p><p>‘W-What is this stuff made of?”</p><p>Minako, however, 
struggled with the condition the hardest.</p><p><i>I-I can’t breathe! The air-- it’s so 
heavy…! </i>The blonde let out another string of coughs, her chest was heaving heavily for 
some respite. She never thought it would be this hard. She was beginning to 
panic.</p><p>“Minako, listen to me. Try to relax.” Haruka advised. “I know it might sound 
stupid, but you have to trust me on this. Your body is adjusting to the atmosphere right 
now. The best thing you can do is let it happen. If you try to fight it, the poison will 
just spread faster through your system. It will only hurt more!”</p><p>Despite the warning, 
Minako instinctively felt her mind trying to resist the process. It registered pain and 
panic, nothing more. As a result the poison was spreading at a dangerous rate, faster than 
her body could convert it.</p><p>A cool hand found its way under her chin. Minako was coaxed 
to look up to see Michiru’s gentle, but firm gaze focused on her.</p><p>“I know it is 
difficult… However, you must calm down. Concentrate, and slowly release your aura. What you 
need to fight against is not yourself, but against your natural instincts towards fear.” 
Neptune advised.</p><p><b>“</b><b>She’s right. You need to try and relax.”</b> Rei 
encouraged.</p><p><i>But I AM trying! </i>Minako protested. She couldn’t understand why her 
body was as stiff as a board.</p><p>Rei sensed the woman’s confusion.</p><p><b>“</b><b>When 
our muscles become too tense, our aura is restricted.</b> <b>Right now, you’re too tense to 
release a sufficient amount of power. That’s why you need to relax!”</b></p><p>From Pluto, 
Rei could feel Minako’s powers continue to diminish. With a grit of her teeth, she shot off 
a mental command.</p><p>The Venusian was startled when the connection between them suddenly 
sparked. The red threads inside of her began to glow and flow into her muscles, soothing her 
frazzled nerves and dilating the veins and arteries. As a direct consequence, the poison 
infiltrating Minako’s system abruptly slowed in its advance against the Goddess’s vengeful, 
rapidly building immunity system.</p><p>A few seconds passed, followed by moments of final 
resistance before Minako’s body suddenly went limp and crumpled to the 
ground.</p><p>“Minako!” Everyone cried.</p><p>“Minako, say something!”</p><p><i>Is she…? 
</i>Haruka thought fearfully. Already she could feel herself regretting the decision to 
bring Minako along; maybe she hadn’t been ready after all. The woman’s green eyes scanned 
the younger woman’s body in search of signs of life.</p><p><i>Ah! Wait a 
second.</i></p><p>Upon closer inspection she could make out the soft rise and fall of the 
Venusian’s chest. Minako’s breathing rate was beginning to stabilize. After another minute, 
the Goddess stirred and immediately went to push herself back onto her feet.</p><p><i>Thank 
the Gods. </i>Uranus sighed in relief.</p><p>Michiru heard her partner softly sigh behind 
her and she felt her own relief washing over her.</p><p>“Are you all right?” Michiru 
asked.</p><p>“I-I think so…” Minako blinked back in confusion. Her blue eyes were a little 
unfocused, but their intensity was quickly returning. “But...what just 
happened?”</p><p>“It’s like I said. Your body was adjusting to the smog.” Haruka told her. 
“It’s like a poisonous gas, so it’ll really give your system a nasty jolt if you’re not 
ready for it.”</p><p><i>Yeah, but it really felt like I was going to die. Am I the only one 
who had this much trouble adjusting?</i></p><p>“I wouldn’t worry about it. The very same 
thing happened to Haruka as well,” Michiru said, as if she had read the younger woman’s 
mind.</p><p>“You mean she actually collapsed too?”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“Hush 
now, love... as you said, it’s not a big deal. I think... the reason why the two of you had 
more difficulty than the rest of us is because you had only ascended recently.”</p><p>“Oh 
yeah... I think you mentioned something about this before.” Haruka nodded 
thoughtfully.</p><p>“Well, I don’t,” Minako said. “Would someone please explain to me what 
you’re talking about?”</p><p>“Actually, it’s kinda of a long explanation.” Haruka laughed 
nervously. “Some of the terms are kinda long and complicated, and we’re kinda on a time 
crunch, but all you need to know is that this is the reason why we couldn’t bring Rei with 
us.”</p><p>“You mean, only Gods and Goddesses can survive here.”</p><p>“Yes. That’s 
precisely it,” Michiru confirmed. “However, it would be rather rude of us not to tell you 
why. First of all, I’m sure that you’ve noticed that when an individual ascends to the 
position of a God or Goddess there is a fundamental change in the user’s body. One of these 
changes is the addition of a mechanism to the individual’s immunity system. It is constantly 
changing and adapting to accommodate for the prevention of diseases. This fog, for instance, 
is a poison. It’s not directly a disease, but it does attack the immune system. Therefore... 
since none of you have ever encountered something like this prior to now, your body had to 
adjust to it. Even as we speak now, you are still adjusting.”</p><p>“I see. So, if Rei was 
here... She would have died.”</p><p>“<b>...”</b></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Hey, guys, we’re on a 
time limit, remember?” Haruka pointed out “We really need to get this search on a 
roll.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re right. I’m sorry...”</p><p>“Not a problem. Anyway, the three of 
you should be fine from here on out. But if anything suddenly feels strange, let us know 
immediately.”</p><p>“Right.” They all nodded.</p><p>“All right. Now what to do...” The wind 
ruler changed her focus onto their surroundings. It was still as bleak as she had last 
remembered it. “I don’t think we should be splitting up in these conditions, so I want us 
all to move as a group. If by any chance one of us gets separated, then stay where you are 
and throw out a handful of aura threads. That’s how we’ll find you if you get lost. And 
lastly... if you sense anything strange, and I mean <i>anything</i>, alert the group right 
away. Just because a person can’t survive out here, it doesn’t mean that there aren’t any 
other dangers lurking around.”</p><p><i>Who knows what could be lurking out there since I 
was last here.</i></p><p>“’Kay, it sounds like we’re all set. Where do we start?” Makoto 
questioned.</p><p>“Michiru?” Haruka passed on the leadership role.</p><p>The Goddess’s gaze 
went momentarily vacant and was filled by a strange light until she raised her arm and 
pointed to a general direction.</p><p>“There is a foreign presence in that direction…” She 
slowly analyzed. “However, I cannot distinguish whether or not it is Hotaru’s. This entire 
planet is inhabited by a strange energy. It is everywhere and appears to be constantly 
fluctuating. My suggestion is that we investigate with caution.”</p><p>“Fair enough. Let’s 
go then.”</p><p>As they all ventured out after Michiru, a movement in Minako’s peripheral 
vision caught her eye.</p><p>The blonde turned on the spot.</p><p>“Huh?” She paused, 
silently scanning the area with furrowed eyebrows. “Did I just...? I thought-- I just saw 
something…”</p><p><b>“</b><b>Mina, they’re leaving you behind!”</b></p><p>“Ah? 
Oh!”</p><p>And while the blonde raced to catch up to the group, she wondered whether or not 
Rei had sensed it as well.</p><p>“<i>Rei…?”</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>What is 
it?”</b></p><p>“<i>Did you…”</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>?”</b></p><p>“<i>I thought... I saw 
something out there.”</i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>Did you see what it 
was?”</b></i></p><p>“<i>No. I’m afraid not.”</i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>Keep an eye out for 
now. If you sense something again, let the others know right 
away.”</b></i></p><p>“<i>Right.”</i></p><p><u>(Rei, Pluto)</u></p><p>“Setsuna, was 
it?”</p><p>The green-haired woman was so focused on her work that she had barely heard the 
other woman call to her. The request for her attention would have fallen onto deaf ears 
altogether if it had been by any other title, anything other than her name. Being alone for 
so long, she supposed that her name would have vanished into the flow of time altogether. 
Thus it was a shocking surprise to hear it resurrected again.</p><p>Setsuna kept her 
surprise to herself, but she answered the Martian nevertheless.</p><p>“Is there something 
that is disturbing you?”</p><p>“I have a question for you. Saturn is a dangerous place. It’s 
so poisonous, that it’s impossible for any living being to set foot there. However...is it 
possible for something, <i>non-human</i> to inhabit the place?”</p><p>“Why are you asking 
me?”</p><p>“Why? I thought that was pretty obvious. You have more than enough power to block 
out Michiru’s spells, and you can hold Hotaru back single-handedly. As much as I hate to 
admit it, that means you’ve got a lot of power. It might even be possible...for you to see 
the future.”</p><p>Setsuna was silent for a moment. “You and the successor of Neptune do not 
seem to get along.”</p><p>Rei twitched. <i>Butting into my private life AGAIN! </i>“That’s 
not the point. Do you know the answer or don’t you?”</p><p>“...”</p><p><i>Not going to say 
anything, huh? </i>“Fine. Then how about this? What will happen to them once they find 
Hotaru’s heart?”</p><p>“…I do not know.”</p><p>“What do you mean you don’t know?!”</p><p>“It 
is as I said. The young lady is mysterious in her own way. The future…” She continued, “…is 
clouded, even to my sight.”</p><p><i>So I was right! She can see the future! </i>Rei 
supposed she shouldn’t have been as surprised as she was; after all, the former chief 
advisor of Apollo must have had some special abilities to inherit such a position.</p><p>“So 
you really can’t see anything.” The raven-haired woman pursued.</p><p>“Nothing of the future 
is certain. All one may see are its possibilities. That woman… Lady Neptune, I suppose I 
should say, has gained the ability to glimpse these possibilities as well.”</p><p><i>Yeah, 
isn’t Michiru special?</i> The Martian instantly retorted. If Setsuna had sensed the her 
companion’s displeasure, she ignored it.</p><p>“However… Even as talented as she is, she 
cannot reach the same distance that you are currently exhibiting.”</p><p>Rei was knocked 
speechless. “What? What are you getting at...? It’s not like it’s a big deal or anything.” 
She would have averted her gaze if she could, but she was currently upholding the spell. 
“I’m sure she could do the same thing if she tried.”</p><p>“Do you really believe that?” 
Again, she surprised her. “There is a power that you possess...that only a few know 
of.”</p><p>“Oh... you mean that.” Rei said quietly. “Heh, I wouldn’t really call it a power. 
It’s more like a nuisance if you ask me.”</p><p>“It is a God’s technique... one that was 
forged by Ares himself.” By now, Rei didn’t even bat an eye. “Due to its...adverse effects, 
it should be impossible for a normal individual to wield it. However, you can and have. 
Thus, it is also the reason for your current ailment. If it continues, in due time you 
will--”</p><p>“Stop.” She heard the woman pause. “Whatever you do, please don’t tell the 
others about this. They don’t know about it.”</p><p>“...Do you ever plan on telling 
them?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then what do you intend to do about it? I thought that you were 
concerned for their safety.”</p><p>“I am.” She thought about Ami’s gun tucked in beneath her 
clothing. “But as long as I have this medication, they should be safe.”</p><p>“I’m 
afraid...That alone won’t be enough.”</p><p>Rei was lost for words. “W-What did you just 
say?!”</p><p>“The medication that you use now is only a temporarily relief. It will not be 
enough to spare you from your fate.”</p><p>There was a frown on Rei’s lips. “I know. But you 
don’t have to say it like that. I know...better than anyone what it’ll do to me!”</p><p>“Yet 
you would not search for the only cure?”</p><p>Rei felt as though the wind had been kicked 
out of her.</p><p>“You told Uranus that there was no cure. That was a lie. You...do know of 
one.”</p><p>All of this talk was really starting to piss Rei off.</p><p>“Back off!” She 
snarled. “That’s none of your business! Why on Mars do you care about it so much 
anyway?!”</p><p>“You just reminded me of someone. That’s all...”</p><p><i>Huh? </i>The 
confession caught the Martian off guard. “Who?”</p><p>“One who also believed that their fate 
could not be changed,” The green-haired woman replied solemnly.</p><p>“Fate...” Rei wondered 
aloud. “Are you saying that you really believe in something stupid like that?”</p><p>“You 
don’t?” Setsuna calmly asked.</p><p>“Well, what about you?” Rei countered. “From the sounds 
of it, you’ve lived for quite some time. I’m sure you have something to say about 
it.”</p><p>“I had once believed that some things were inevitable, that some are impossible 
to change,” Setsuna finally said. “However...<i>she</i> believed that this was not the 
case.”</p><p>“She?”</p><p>“...A good friend of mine.”</p><p>Rei was starting to get a bad 
feeling about this. “So, this good friend...Where is she now?” She noticed that the former 
advisor wasn’t even looking at her now. “...I’m sorry. It wasn’t any of my business to 
ask.”</p><p>Rei was about to lose herself in work again until something else came to mind. 
Her eyes shot back open.</p><p><i>What if--?</i></p><p>“Setsuna!”</p><p>“I am 
fine.”</p><p>“But--”</p><p><b>“</b><b>Rei!”</b></p><p><i>Minako?</i></p><p><u>(Minako, 
Saturn)</u></p><p><b>“</b><b>What’s wrong?!”</b></p><p>“<i>Something really weird is 
happening! I don’t know what’s going on! We were just walking, and all of the sudden the fog 
started to get really thick!”</i></p><p>Minako squinted at the mist, trying to keep an eye 
on her friends. <i>Erg--this mist! What’s going on here? </i>She shivered. It was so cold 
that her teeth were almost chattering.</p><p>Up ahead, everyone else was having similar 
thoughts. Ami, Makoto, Haruka and Michiru were all doing their best to keep their guard 
up.</p><p><i>It is just me, or is it getting colder? </i></p><p><i>I really don’t like the 
looks of this...</i></p><p><i>Something’s definitely feels fishy about this place. 
</i></p><p><i>We must be getting closer.</i></p><p>The air around them was changing. But 
what’s more, it felt like the mist was closing in around them.</p><p>For the next few 
minutes, no other sound could be heard except for the sound of their hearts pounding loudly 
in their ears. Eventually, the distinct noise became so pronounced that they all thought 
they were having trouble hearing; was it just them, or did it sound like their hearts merged 
into one beat?</p><p><i>Rei… do you hear that? </i>Minako tensed up 
fearfully.</p><p><b>“</b><b>It sounds like a… heartbeat?!”</b></p><p>They all came to a 
stop, but the mist continued to get thicker.</p><p>“Damn it! I can’t stand it anymore! Come 
out, wherever you are!” Haruka summoned up a portion of her power. “Take…this! 
HAAAH!”</p><p><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p>The golden bolt charged through the smog, but it hardly 
had any effect on the entity. But she wasn’t about to let that deter her.</p><p>“Come 
on--!”</p><p><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p>“Why isn’t this---”</p><p><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p>“--doing 
anything?!”</p><p><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p>“ARGH!” Haruka let out a frustrated roar as the fog 
rose higher into her line of vision. She was already so blinded that she never noticed the 
other’s disappearing from sight.</p><p>“It’s--” Ami disappeared behind the 
veil.</p><p>“--Too fast!” Makoto shouted, and she too disappeared.</p><p>Minako watched 
horrified as her friends disappeared from sight. For a brief moment she could still hear 
Haruka stomping about in a fit of rage, but eventually that too was swallowed by the fog. 
She suddenly found herself very alone.</p><p>“Guys...?” Minako whispered. Unconsciously she 
stepped back when she meant to step forward. “W-Where did everyone 
go?”</p><p><b>“</b><b>Don’t move.”</b> Rei advised.</p><p><i>Huh? Oh, right! Haruka said we 
shouldn’t move if we get lost!</i> The woman gathered her power and was about to send out a 
beckon when Rei interrupted her.</p><p><b>“</b><b>Forget about that! We aren’t alone! Can’t 
you feel it? There’s a huge energy heading this 
way!!”</b></p><p>“What?!”</p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p><i>Oh my Goddess-! I-It’s 
huge!</i></p><p>Minako whirled on the spot when she thought she saw movement from the corner 
of her eye again.</p><p>“W-Who’s there?” This time, however, the blonde woman was certain 
that she was being watched; a shadow of a person flickered in and out of the mist. Every 
time the Venusian ruler thought she spotted the figure, it retreated promptly into the foggy 
veil. Their movements were almost ghostly, too fluid to be a normal being. It gave Minako 
the chills just thinking what this entity could do if she were ambushed.</p><p><i>Damn. 
Everytime… I think I… See them… THEY MOVE!</i></p><p>“AHHHHHHHHHH!” Someone 
screamed.</p><p><b>“</b><b>What was that?!” </b>Rei demanded.</p><p>“T-That…”</p><p>“<i>That 
</i><i>sounded like Ami!”</i></p><p>More screams filled the air. Quickly after there 
followed explosions and sounds of a fierce battle.</p><p>Minako was momentarily paralyzed. 
<i>W-What should I do?</i> The ground beneath her suddenly began to shake. Before she knew 
it the vibrations were gaining power, as if the wave was charging towards 
her.</p><p><b>RMM…RMM…RMM…<br>SHROOOM!</b></p><p>A large object flew through the fog and 
blinded Minako. The blonde barely let out a screech when something wrapped tight about her 
waist and threw her up into the air within its 
clutches.</p><p><b>“</b><b>Minako!”</b></p><p>“AHHHHHH!!!!!!”</p><p>Her movements abruptly 
halted mid-air, and finally she was able to see what had ambushed her.</p><p><i>W-What is 
that? </i>She gasped. <i>Is that, a tree root?! </i></p><p>Below where she was held the 
blonde woman noticed that the smog below had cleared. Tracing the root down to where its 
source was she could make out a cage-like aggregate of similar vines. Out of her peripheral 
vision Minako could make out the others engaging combat with the enemy, but her true focus 
was on a glimmering light caught between the mass of branches below. As soon as she laid 
eyes on it, her heart skipped a beat.</p><p><i>Is that it?!</i></p><p>The enormous vine-like 
entity immediately tightened its hold on its victim, crushing Minako hard. She screamed 
again.</p><p>“Hold on!” Haruka shouted to her. But the tall ruler already had enough on her 
plate as it was. She could barely make two steps towards the Venusian before another root 
cut her off.</p><p>“Damn!” <i>Not again! </i>“HAH!”</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>“Ah… 
A-AHHHH!” Minako repeatedly gasped. She could swear that she could hear her bones cracking 
inwards.</p><p><i>Am I going to die? </i>She desperately tried to move her arms, to do 
SOMETHING! That was when it really begun to sink in; she couldn’t expect anyone, especially 
her brave brother, to save her again. <i>Eros...</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>Mina, hold on, 
I’ll---”</b></p><p>“DON’T!”</p><p><b>“</b><b>What?” </b>Rei remarked incredulously. Did she 
hear what she thought she heard?</p><p>“Don’t do anything Rei! Don’t interfere! Let me… ugh… 
do this by myself!”</p><p><b>“</b><b>But you’ll die if you don’t do something 
soon!”</b></p><p>“<i>Heh. Don’t worry. I won’t 
die.”</i></p><p><i><b>Fwoooooo---</b></i></p><p>“<b>What are you doing?!”</b></p><p>Minako 
clenched her fists by her sides and felt the rest of her muscles tensing up in unison. As 
her power became restricted, the pain from the fog increased. <i>C’mon 
Minako...</i><i>Concentrate on the power, not the pain</i>.</p><p>Rei freaked when Minako 
suddenly went limp in their enemy’s grip.</p><p><b>“</b><b>Minako!”</b></p><p>The crushing 
grip that sought to initialize the finishing blow was rebuffed violently by a orange light. 
All of the pent up energy was unleashed like a flood; its levels was soaring to great 
heights and materialized around the Venusian with dangerous intensity.</p><p>“Take… THIS! 
HAAAAH!”</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE-------KABOOM!!!</b></i></p><p>The blonde woman fell to the 
ground as the leftover pieces of the root scattered lifelessly below her. As soon as she 
touched the hard, rocky surface, Minako sprinted forward with her eyes on the goal-- the 
glimmering light. She wasn’t about to get there easily however; more branches at its base 
shot forward to challenge her.</p><p>“Minako, what are you doing?!” Makoto cried out. The 
tall woman swung her spear around and destroyed the root that had been aiming to pierce her 
athletic frame. “Hah!”</p><p><i><b>SLASH!</b></i></p><p>“Look out!” Michiru warned the 
Venusian as she took out another root.</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! 
Tup! Tup!</b></i></p><p>Minako ignored the surprised cries thrown her way. The others must 
have not seen what she had.</p><p>As she encountered the first vine, she heard Rei 
shout,</p><p><b>“</b><b>Go right!”</b></p><p>She faithfully followed the instruction. As the 
large snake-impersonating object flew past her, Minako flicked her hands and summoned up two 
large, golden chains. She didn’t hesitate to put them to 
use.</p><p>“HAH!”</p><p><i><b>SWING!<br></b></i><br><i>Watch me Rei. I can do this myself! 
</i>She gasped when one of the root pieces began to squirm again. <i>Goddess, these things 
regenerate?!</i></p><p><i><b>SWING!<br>SWING!</b></i></p><p><b>“…</b><b>Do you still think 
that I’m trying protecting you? That I’m trying to baby 
you?”</b></p><p>“…”</p><p><b>“</b><b>I’m not fighting for you! I’m fighting with you! Don’t 
go dismissing an advantage in the battlefield so easily!”</b></p><p>“<i>Jeez… You’re just so 
STUBBORN!”</i></p><p>Neither woman could help but smirk at this turn of 
events.</p><p><b>“</b><b>Ready?”</b></p><p>“Ready!”</p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! 
Tup!</b></i></p><p>“<b>Left!”<br>“Up!”<br>“Watch your 
back!”<br>“Right!”</b></p><p><i><b>Swing!<br>Swing!<br>Swing!<br>Swing!</b></i></p><p>As 
Minako closed in onto her target, and the roots were taken out one by one, the other 
Goddesses finally caught a glimpse of the glimmering light as well.</p><p><i>That’s what 
she’s after! </i>Haruka, Michiru, Ami and Makoto realized.</p><p>Uranus smirked; no matter 
how many they destroyed these things kept coming back. Why wasn’t the solution 
obvious?</p><p>“Okay! So why don’t we show these things what we’re made of?!” She 
roared.</p><p>Following Uranus, everyone charged up their powers. There was a brilliant 
flash of light as four blasts of energy all converged and disintegrated all 
resistance.</p><p><i><b>Crackle—<br>Crackle---<br>Crackle---<br>Crackle---<br>Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen- 
KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</b></i></p><p>Minako braced herself against the blast as a rush of air 
flung up into the atmosphere. Before the roots could regenerate, the blonde woman shot 
forward with one outstretched hand and touched the light within the cage.</p><p><i>I-I got 
it!</i></p><p><i><b>FLAAAAAASSSSSSSSH!</b></i></p><p>Another bright light lit the area, 
blinding everyone in the vicinity. However, when the light faded away it left behind small 
shimmering lights in the air. They rained down all around them, twinkling and sparkling 
mysteriously in the absence of the dangerous tree roots. It was such a sight that all the 
Goddesses couldn’t help but awe at the scene.</p><p>“Hey. Look, over there,” Ami pointed 
out. There was a stranger amongst them.</p><p>The figure was transparent, but her features 
could still be clearly made out. Short raven coloured hair, and dark eyes. Her attire 
resembled the outfits that Haruka and Michiru donned when using Planet Power. Beside 
figure’s bow was the heart crystal; it was shining brightly, composed of several smaller 
crystals. But more importantly, in their right hand, the youth held a glaive that radiated 
with frightening, dark power.</p><p>“H-Hotaru…?” Minako whispered. <i>No way! But 
that’s—It’s really her!</i></p><p>The vacant gaze in the addressed party fled, and was 
immediately replaced by forlorn sadness. In a listless tone, the woman spoke whispery 
words.</p><p>“Who are you...? All of you…?”</p><p>“Hotaru…” Haruka muttered. She had never 
seen that expression in the girl’s eyes before. She looked much older and almost detached. 
If this was Hotaru’s heart, her true self, then it was like Haruka never knew her at 
all.</p><p>“Who are you?” Hotaru repeated again, more firmly this time. She appeared to be 
becoming agitated.</p><p>“Hotaru, w-we came to get you.” Minako licked her dry lips 
uncertainly. “Setsuna asked us to.”</p><p>“Setsuna…” She considered the name sadly. She knew 
Setsuna would not send untrustworthy souls for her.</p><p>Hotaru then slowly shook her head. 
“I’m sorry. But I cannot go back.”</p><p>“But, why not?!”</p><p>“Because I… I committed a 
terrible crime.”</p><p>“But that—it wasn’t your fault! Apollo forced you to do it, didn’t 
he?!” Haruka protested. “You were kidnapped and he forced you to destroy the Moon Kingdom! 
We know what happened! It’s not your fault!”</p><p>“You’re wrong.” She whispered in 
response.</p><p>“Wha? What do you mean, I’m wrong?”</p><p>Hotaru closed her eyes. She could 
feel the sorrow rising within her once again. It was like a scar that her soul was forced to 
bear for the rest of eternity. And now, these people were about to rip it open 
again.</p><p>“I was not kidnapped. I went with him...on my own accord.” The youth ignored 
the predictably shocked expressions of her 
audience.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“But...why?”</p><p>“The people… the citizens, the palace 
staff, everyone who I thought were my friends…feared me because of my power. They greeted my 
twin sister and myself with smiles, but behind our backs, they called me the ‘devil 
incarnate’. At the time, I couldn’t understand it. What was so different between myself and 
my sister? Why did they praise her but condemn me...? After some time, I came to the 
conclusion that I must’ve been lacking something important. So I trained harder. I truly 
believed that, perhaps.., if I worked harder, they would come to praise me sincerely as 
well.</p><p>So I practiced harder, and grew stronger, without realizing that it was my mere 
existence that drove them to hate me so…</p><p>Apollo... I had heard of him one day while my 
mother and Setsuna were engaged in a private conversation. I had overheard that he was my 
uncle. He was the only other relative that I had aside from my mother and sister.</p><p>Thus 
I was not surprised in the least when the man appeared before me that day, many centuries 
ago. He offered to give me a home, a place away from those who loathed my existence. I 
didn’t hesitate… I accepted.</p><p>Therefore, you see...I was not kidnapped. That is why you 
are wrong.”</p><p>Haruka was feeling her heart break all over again.</p><p>“Then, but why… 
The Moon Kingdom…” Michiru couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>The raven-haired youth looked each 
of the Goddesses in the eye. It seemed that they genuinely wanted to know.</p><p>“Please 
keep in mind, that you were the ones who requested this.”</p><p>Similarly as with Setsuna, a 
bright light filled the area.</p><p><b>FLAAASSSSSSSSH!</b></p><p><i>The image of the Moon 
Kingdom came to view. From the point of view, it appeared that the person was viewing the 
majestic place from the outskirts. There, near the borders beside a grove of silver leafed 
trees, Apollo came into sight. Beside him at his side, with one of the God’s mighty arms 
wrapped about her slim shoulders, was Hotaru. The girl looked to be in her late 
teens.</i></p><p>“<i>Do you see that Hotaru?” Apollo directed gaze towards the bright 
lights. “This is the ‘home’ that you once spoke so fondly of. You’ve slaved away your entire 
life for their sake, but look at how they repay you. They ridicule you behind your back, and 
condemn you as the devil’s spawn. Yet what have you done to deserve this sort of treatment? 
Nothing... because, my dear niece, you have done nothing wrong. Even now, look at how happy 
they are now that you’re gone. It looks like they haven’t missed you at 
all.”</i></p><p><i>Sadness reflected in the woman’s dark eyes. As much as she wished to, she 
could not find the voice to protest against her uncle’s observations; the place she had 
called home looked exactly the same as the day she had left. It hadn’t changed at all. But 
she had.</i></p><p>“<i>You have grown considerably in power. You have mastered your unique 
form of Planet Power and have even surpassed the Gods and Goddesses of my court! But do you 
not think...that it is time to use that power...?”</i></p><p><i>Apollo gave Hotaru’s 
shoulder a gentle squeeze, acting as if he actually cared about the individual that was born 
as his niece.</i></p><p>“<i>It hurts, doesn’t it?” The God prodded. “Watching them like 
this, without you… You belonged there but they didn’t want you. They called you the ‘devil’, 
rejected you and betrayed me. They also betrayed ‘Uncle Apollo’.” He 
stressed.</i></p><p>“<i>Betrayed…Uncle Apollo…” His niece repeated in a trance-like state. 
She was confused. Where had all of these emotions come from so suddenly? She never believed 
she would feel like this ever again.</i></p><p><i>The man ignored the inward cringe of 
having been called ‘uncle’ however he believed it would be worth while it in the end. After 
many years of meticulous planning, the child’s loyalty now solely belonged to him. After 
all, he was the one who cared for her, who watched over her and taught her everything that 
she knew—it was him who molded her into what she was now! And that sort of person, who else 
could possibly be within her heart other than him? What possibly could be left behind from 
her past, other than those delightfully, painful memories? After all, no being would readily 
remember the ‘good’ times when there were ones that were so much more 
painful!</i></p><p><i>He then leaned down and whispered into Hotaru’s ear to solidify the 
spell.</i></p><p>“<i>Is it fair?” His niece gasped. “Make the 
pain...disappear.”</i></p><p><i>Hotaru didn’t know what hit her-- suddenly all the pent up 
frustration, sorrow and anger--something inside snapped. To Apollo’s delight, his niece’s 
hidden power was unleashed. It was growing at an exponential rate, all the while the girl’s 
consciousness was ever becoming swallowed within a swell of emotion. Just as planned, he 
smirked. It wouldn’t be long before he would set her upon the traitorous dogs that had 
deserted him. </i></p><p><i>But what of the twin sister? Ah… He had not forgotten the other 
brat. She would be easily deposed of. She had taken after Artemis after all, his sister. 
Surely the child had no experience of battle whatsoever. What’s more, it mattered not if the 
two siblings would destroy each other in the end or if Hotaru perished while executing the 
deed. What did matter...? The only thing that did was that the threat to him would be 
obliterated! The Gods and Goddesses of his court would come to see that they could be just 
as easily disposed of if they also chose to foolishly betray him. After all, they were 
nothing but weak pawns to him!</i></p><p><i>Apollo almost felt like laughing. His hate felt 
so good!</i></p><p>“<i>Destroy the Moon Kingdom Hotaru… Kill all who stands in your way! 
Destroy! Destroy! AHAHAHAHAHA!”</i></p><p><i><b>RMM…RMM…RMM…</b></i></p><p><i>Many scenes 
flashed before everyone’s eyes. The buildings that Setsuna had mentioned were being 
destroyed; the once majestic structures were disintegrating into rubble and were thrown up 
into the air where they would be swallowed up by the dark sky. The air rang loud with 
people’s screams and cries for help as their blood was spilt onto stone streets. It was like 
a work of art to the Sun God’s eye. Red was staining everything. It was the best red colour 
that he had ever witnessed in his long 
existence.</i></p><p><i><b>Crumble…</b></i></p><p><i>Hotaru tread unblinkingly through the 
streets, her powers covering everything she passed and hungrily swallowed it whole. With a 
swing of her weapon, she brought down entire buildings. She could have demolished the entire 
city single-handedly if she chose to, but that would be child’s play. These people weren’t 
her true target. Her clouded sight was set at something bigger, something that almost begged 
to be destroyed by her merciful hand: The Palace.</i></p><p><i>The young woman ventured 
onwards and left behind her path of destruction until she reached the palace grounds, her 
birthplace. There she found her mother awaiting her arrival.</i></p><p><i><b>Tup. Tup. 
Tup…</b></i></p><p>“<i>Hotaru!” Queen Serenity called to her misguided child. “Please stop 
this!”</i></p><p><i>Hotaru then did something her mother did not expect. To the woman’s 
horror, the girl grinned. The garden structure beside her abruptly exploded, but it did not 
slow the youth down at all. That was just a warm up. </i></p><p>“<i>Oh no… She’s released 
too much power. She can’t control it!” Serenity realized. “What should I do…? She’s already 
beyond my limit!” The ruler was about to make the biggest decision of her life, and her 
heart was torn because of it. “Apollo...did you do this? Why...? My dear Hotaru...you really 
don’t recognize me, do you?”</i></p><p><i>The young woman continued forward with killer 
intent. Queen Serenity was running out of time.</i></p><p>“<i>It is my biggest regret to see 
you in so much pain. I never expected for this to happen. To see our time of peace brought 
to an end by one of my own children. But...despite all of that, I do not hate you. No. As 
your mother, I shall save you. I will... stop you.” She vowed. “My life... This is all that 
I can do for you.”</i></p><p>“<i>Wait! You mustn’t use that power! Think about what you’re 
doing!” Another voice rang out.</i></p><p>“<i>Setsuna?!” The Queen exclaimed in shock. “What 
are you doing here? You were supposed to guard--”</i></p><p><i>The advisor shook her head at 
her Lady. “It’s all right. She’s safe. But I simply cannot allow you to fight 
alone!”</i></p><p>“<i>But--”</i></p><p><i>Setsuna turned her sights onto Hotaru. The child 
was beyond reasoning now; all they could do was hope that they could jolt the woman out of 
her detached state. However, it would not be an easy task to accomplish and it deeply 
disturbed Setsuna concerning who they were dealing with. The stakes were high; if any harm 
were to befall Hotaru, the Queen would be devastated. However, on the other hand, if they 
failed they would all perish. Weighing out the consequences, there was only one logical 
choice.</i></p><p>“<i>Forgive me.”Raising her garnet rod into the air, Setsuna called forth 
a planet-shaped ball of energy. It built upon her rod and gained more power as large 
quantities of aura poured into it. Yet as she was about to unleash her attack, Serenity 
cried 
out,</i></p><p>“<i>NO!”</i></p><p><i><b>Wrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiir!</b></i></p><p><i>Setsuna’s 
attack flew far away from her target, leaving herself momentarily wide open. Hotaru saw this 
and, unlike Setsuna, attacked without hesitation.</i></p><p><i>A bolt of purple light 
promptly sent her guardian flying to the side, severely 
injured.</i></p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p>“<i>AHHHHHHHHHH!”</i></p><p>“<i>Setsuna!” 
Serenity looked on horrified at the result of her actions. She hadn’t meant for that to 
happen!</i> <i>“Hotaru.” The mother turned her hurt gaze at her child. It appeared that she 
had no in the matter after all. “This… must end here.”</i></p><p><i>Queen Serenity gathered 
all the power she could muster into the palms of her hands and charged up. Hotaru, as she 
watched this display, knew exactly what was about to happen. With an unconcerned expression 
the dark-haired youth gathered her own power into her glaive. The power she had acquired 
earlier was overwhelming her; she was so consumed within it that she was addicted to the 
feeling. She wanted more, to destroy more, and finally bring an end to the pain that had 
ravaged her heart for so 
long.</i></p><p>“<i>HAAAAAH!”</i></p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!<br>CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p><i><b>FWOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOOOOOOSHHHH!!!</b></i></p><p><i>The 
two powers collided and battled against one another. Already Serenity sensed their 
difference in power. There was no way that she could…</i></p><p>“<i>Mother?!” Shouted a 
distressed voice. A golden-haired woman in a white dress stepped onto the grounds. 
“H-Hotaru?! You’re home?! What’s going on here...?”</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb 
Dubb!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Stay back!” Serenity shouted to her daughter.</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb 
Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i>Finding another golden opportunity, Hotaru pulled out all the cards 
and poured in the rest of her 
power.</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb--</b></i></p><p><i><b>KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</b></i></p><p><i>Serenity, 
her mother… and the Kingdom, all perished within a brilliant flash of white 
light.</i></p><p><i>The scene disappeared and reappeared within the desecrated garden of the 
Moon Palace. Hotaru sat in its center on a piece of unstained marble. The youth was quiet. 
Her dark-hair hung over her eyes, shielding her sight from the horrific view that she 
created.</i></p><p><i>Everything was ruined.</i></p><p>“<i>Why…?”</i></p><p><i>The 
blood…</i></p><p>“<i>Why?”</i></p><p><i>The corpses, the buildings becoming one with the 
sky…</i></p><p><i>Her lips quivered. “Why?!”</i></p><p><i>And then she remembered her 
mother…</i></p><p>“<i>WHY?!” Hotaru screamed. She threw herself to the ground sobbing and 
choking on her own tears. She hit her fists against the hard surface and cut her hands. But 
it didn’t help; she couldn’t feel the pain. It was nothing compared to the guilt that she 
felt. It was no good, no good at all! </i></p><p><i>Frustrated, Hotaru finally punched the 
ground so hard that there was a loud crunch as her bones broke. It hurt, and a scream was 
torn from her throat. After she was able to calm down a little, she hunched over, her 
shoulders slumped, and weakly tried to hug herself. It was so cold.</i></p><p>“…<i>Why… did 
it happen…?” She whispered to herself more quietly. The tears just wouldn’t stop 
flowing.</i></p><p>“<i>I did this… I did it all! Everything! I killed them! ...I killed 
them! I--I killed… them… all…” Her sobbing was renewed. The sliver of sanity she still 
possessed grew dim. “Please, please…” She begged. “</i><i>If only there was a way that I 
could repent for my sins.”</i></p><p><i>Behind her, Setsuna stood with tearful crimson eyes; 
she had somehow managed to stagger up onto her legs, only to find herself too late. Her 
Lady, Queen Serenity and the Kingdom, were all gone. Why was she the only one to survive? 
</i></p><p><i>The advisor was sorely tempted to bring her wrath down onto her Lady’s 
murderer. It would have been so easy to do so, given the state of Hotaru’s mental and 
physical health. However, the woman knew by logic that it was not the ‘child’ that should be 
blamed. Apollo-- that vile name instantly came to mind. He was the one to blame for putting 
Lady Hotaru, for all of them, through such a traumatizing ordeal.</i></p><p><i>Setsuna’s 
crimson eyes focused on the particles drifting off of Hotaru’s form. She was... 
disappearing? The chief advisor immediately understood; Hotaru had pushed too far past her 
limits.</i></p><p>“<i>He took away everything important to me…” The green-haired woman 
angrily scowled. None had ever seen the woman this expressive. None that were alive now, 
that was…</i></p><p><i>Another small movement from the corner of her eye drew her attention 
to another body. Lady Hotaru’s twin…</i></p><p>“<i>She’s alive?”</i></p><p><i>Hotaru’s ears 
perked up immediately. “Alive?” The word rang in her mind. “Who…?” She turned her head until 
her dark eyes spotted her sister. So she wasn’t dead!</i></p><p>“<i>We need a medic.” 
Setsuna mumbled under her breath. Frustration laced her words; she knew the chance of 
finding a person with such a skill was even less than finding another person in these ruins 
alive!</i></p><p><i><b>Tup.</b></i></p><p>“<i>Hotaru?”</i></p><p>“<i>I’ll… disappear soon…” 
Hotaru was well aware of her own predicament. She could already feel her strength waning. 
But she couldn’t bear to leave things like this. Not like this. If there was one thing she 
could do that was good with her powers…</i></p><p><i>Before Setsuna could protest, Hotaru 
outstretched an open palm with her uninjured hand towards the golden-haired girl and infused 
her with her remaining energy. The wounds beneath her administrations began to 
heal.</i></p><p><i>With her energy finally depleted, Hotaru faded with a small smile 
surfacing onto her tear-stained face.</i></p><p>“<i>My true power…” She 
whispered...</i></p><p>… <i>and vanished.</i></p><p>“<i>Good-bye.”</i></p><p><b>. . 
.</b></p><p><b>FLAAASSSSSSSSH!</b></p><p>The light faded, but instead of being greeted by 
expressions of hate or loathing that Hotaru had anticipated she saw nothing but tears on the 
Goddesses faces. She couldn’t understand why they were crying, but she wished they would 
stop. They almost made her want to cry as well.</p><p>“I see…” Ami was the first to speak. 
“Afterwards, you must have known that you would be reborn. So you sealed your heart away 
here. You had no desire to be found…”</p><p>“It’s…still not your fault Hotaru.” Haruka 
repeated. Her hands were clenched at her sides. None of them realized the emotional impact 
the destruction had based on what Setsuna had shown them, but now… now that they 
knew…</p><p>“I understand that’s why you want to stay here. But that’s exactly why you need 
to come back.” Minako whispered with a grim face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Your body, your 
spirit is incomplete without your heart! Setsuna is trying to hold you back with her power, 
but if you don’t return soon, you’ll repeat the same tragedy again without even knowing it! 
So, please Hotaru! Please come back with us!”</p><p>“I’ll repeat that...again?” Hotaru’s 
dark eyes widened in realization.</p><p><i>Wait a second. Now that I think about it, I do 
recall sensing an unusual disturbance some time ago. However, it was somehow different from 
the rest.</i></p><p>Many lights were put out every day. Some were more pronounced than 
others. But the pain that was akin to hers awoke her memory. She had been awake ever since 
without truly realizing it. But since the Moon Kingdom’s destruction, Hotaru had no 
intention of going back and had gone through the trouble of setting up these defensive 
measures to ensure it. She was supposed to sleep forever. However, the connection that she 
had severed with her newly reborn-self had sparked alive again in her brief moment of 
weakness.</p><p><i>Could it be really true? Has the connection between myself and my body 
have been resurrected? If it is... then...<br></i><i><br></i>“Please come back Hotaru...” 
Everyone watched her with pleading eyes.</p><p>In truth Hotaru was still scared. If she 
regained her physical body she would be more than capable of repeating the rampage from long 
ago. The responsibility that came with such a freedom was a great burden. However, there was 
one thing that she knew for certain: If she remained here, and her body had indeed awakened, 
then tragedy would undoubted come full cycle.</p><p><i>I can’t allow that to happen ever 
again!</i></p><p>“All right…I will go with you.” Hotaru’s eyes flashed with determination 
now. The spectre held out her free hand, beckoning to her heart crystal and sent it forward. 
Although the woman’s transparent image had disappeared, the group of Goddesses noticed the 
lingering warmth that now radiated from the heart crystal. It was different somehow, almost 
more hopeful.</p><p>“<i>We have Hotaru’s heart! Rei!”</i> There was a silence. 
“<i>Rei…?”</i></p><p><u>(Rei, Pluto)</u></p><p><i>I’m-- reaching my limit! </i>Rei gritted 
her teeth. Her body was in a terrible condition after enduring hours without food, water or 
rest. Any minute now her stance or concentration will break, whichever happened first, and 
break the spell.</p><p>“Damn. Setsuna, I—I don’t think I can hold it for 
much...longer!”</p><p><b>…</b><i><b>ping…</b></i></p><p>Rei froze. She had only left Setsuna 
unattended for a few hours, but the woman looked even more ragged than herself. The former 
advisor was trembling in a desperate attempt to keep her garnet rod lifted and her powers 
strong, but it came with a price and now Rei could truly see the toll that it took on her. 
Setsuna was perspiring badly, undoubtedly suffering from dehydration.</p><p><i>Wait a 
minute. How long has she been holding that barrier?! </i>“Setsuna!” <i>This is 
bad!</i></p><p>Amethyst eyes shot back to Hotaru. The barrier was weakening and Hotaru knew 
it. The Martian’s blood ran cold seeing the signs of consciousness from the drowsy woman 
inside. After witnessing that vision on Saturn, she did <i>not </i>want to ever encounter 
that.</p><p><i>If the barrier breaks, then--!</i></p><p>“Ugh…!” Setsuna’s stance faltered 
and the barrier wavered briefly. The place around them shook slightly, off 
balance.</p><p>“<i>Mina, we’ve got trouble!” </i>Rei told the 
blonde.</p><p><b>“</b><b>Trouble?! What’s going on? Rei?!”</b></p><p>“<i>I’m sorry,” but I 
have to break the 
link.</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>REI?!---”</b></p><p><i><b>Snap</b></i></p><p>Rei regretted 
cutting the connection, but there was something dire that she needed to attend to 
first.</p><p>“Setsuna! Hang on!” The Martian rushed to the woman’s side. She promptly gave 
one quick look at the situation before attempting to focus her powers where Setsuna 
was.</p><p><i><b>Fwooooosh!</b></i></p><p>“We do not… have enough strength between us…” 
Setsuna gasped out. With Rei in her weakened state, it would only briefly prolong the 
inevitable at best.</p><p>“But what else can we do? We can’t give up now!”</p><p><i>I guess, 
we’ll need to use that after all…</i> The former advisor darkly thought. She had sincerely 
hoped to return to that place under better circumstances.</p><p>“Concentrate on the 
barrier!” Setsuna instructed. “Do not lose focus, no matter what!”</p><p>“What? Hey! Where 
are you going?!” Rei grunted under the burden placed upon her shoulders. It was insane-- she 
never realized how much energy the other woman was expending for the procedure. “W-Whatever 
you have in mind, you better do it fast!!!”</p><p>Setsuna took a few steps back and took a 
deep breath. Her heart was still pounding, but she knew the punishment otherwise would be 
much more severe if she didn’t act now. With that, she transferred the remainder of her 
power and summoned a 
spell.</p><p>“Setsuna?!”</p><p><i><b>FWOOOOOOOOOOOSH!</b></i></p><p><u>(Rei, Moon Kingdom 
Ruins)</u></p><p>Rei’s stomach did flip-flops as they landed into a foreign setting. She 
didn’t know what Setsuna did, but the Martian knew that they were no longer on 
Pluto.</p><p>Rei barely blinked before she saw Setsuna speeding away into a large building 
structure up ahead.</p><p>“Set--”</p><p><i>Huh? Is that--a palace…? Ruins...? N-No way! 
It--It can’t be!</i></p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></i></p><p>Inside the palace Setsuna 
urgently sought out the throne room. The past memories assaulted her as she crossed the 
empty corridors, past the ornaments that used to hang from the walls that now lay on the 
floor in pieces, until she reached it.</p><p>The green-haired woman had to suck in breath 
when she finally stood before the throne room door. It broke her heart. Behind these doors, 
she would never see that person smile at her ever again. But it had no relevance to their 
current situation. There was only one person that she sought now.</p><p><i>There’s only one 
person who can help us now!</i></p><p><i><b>Creeeeeeak.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Tup. Tup. Tup. 
Tup.</b></i></p><p>Setsuna strode up the red carpet, following it to her destination. For up 
there, on the throne and held by a wall of crystallized ice…</p><p>“We are in need of your 
aid…”</p><p>The woman looked the sleeping figure in the 
face.</p><p>“Usagi.”</p><p><b>DOOOOOOM</b></p>
