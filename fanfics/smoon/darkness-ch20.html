Darien stared at the girl that lay on the nice and comfortable bed. She 
lay asleep, looking so peaceful and serene. Darien grinned in delight, 
finally capturing what he wanted. He had been looking for this girl for 
years, and now she has fallen into his hands.

He moved over and caressed the girl&#39;s cheek gently.

&#39;My god, she&#39;s so fascinating,&#39; thought Darien. He looked her over, 
taking in her beauty. Darien looked up and watched as Zack entered the 
room. He looked at Darien and sat on the other end of  the sleeping 
vampire.

&quot;So this is her?,&quot; asked Zack, looking over the girl in surprise and 
excitement. Darien nodded his head enthusiastically.

&quot;Yea, this is her,&quot;

&quot;Amazing!,&quot; exclaimed Zack. &quot;For such a small girl to have such power,&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; whispered Darien. &quot;I couldn&#39;t believe it myself when I saw 
her&quot; He suddenly looked at Zack.

&quot;Something happened back there, when Malcolm shot this raven haired 
girl,&quot; said Darien. Zack looked at Darien questioningly.

&quot;What happened?,&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know, she held this demonic look in her eyes. She was going for 
the kill. I mean, if she wasn&#39;t hit with that dart, Malcolm and I would 
probably be dead right now,&quot; said Darien, grinning from ear to ear. Zack 
looked at his friend in bewilderment.

&quot;And this excites you?,&quot;

&quot;Yes, I want to see her angry Zack. I want to see her true power,&quot; 
replied Darien, staring into his friend&#39;s eyes. Zack got off of the bed 
and looked at his friend as if he was insane.

&quot;Are you crazy. If you say she holds so much power when she killed two 
of our top slayers a couple years ago, how powerful do you think she is 
now. She can probably can kill us all now, if given the chance!,&quot; 
exclaimed Zack. Darien grinned.

&quot;And that is the exciting part,&quot; said Darien with a twisted look. &quot;I 
want to fight someone strong, who I wont be ashamed to die against, and 
she is the one.&quot; said Darien. Zack shook his head, not understanding.

&quot;I don&#39;t get you man, I&#39;m starting to think that you&#39;re loosing it,&quot; 
replied Zack.

&quot;Think what you want my friend,&quot; said Darien. Both men looked at the 
girl, upon hearing her groan and stir.

&quot;Darien, lets put her somewhere, where she cant escape. We don&#39;t need 
her on the loose,&quot; said Zack. Darien nodded.

&quot;Alright, grab her and follow me,&quot; said Darien. Zack nodded and grabbed 
a hold of the girl and followed after the man.

*********

Serena slowly opened her eyes, her vision was a bit blurry and she had a 
major headache. She tried to move her hands, but to no avail. She was 
able to focus her eyes and noticed she wasn&#39;t home. She slowly moved her 
head around to get a better look of her surroundings. She noticed that 
she was in a rather spacious room, with practically nothing in it, 
besides herself.

She looked down at herself, and saw that she was chained down to a 
chair. She racked her brain, trying to remember what happened  and why 
she was here. Suddenly, the memory hit her full force, the slayers had 
invaded her home. They had hurt her girlfriend and taken herself 
captive.

She snapped out of her thoughts, seeing that the door was opening. 
Darien walked into the room, a smirk upon his lips. She glared at the 
man, pure hatred burning in her eyes. Her eyes followed his every 
movement. 

Darien smiled with amusement, but on the inside, his body shook with 
fear, from the deadly look his was receiving, which trilled him to the 
core. Darien leaned against a wall, arms crossed over his chest. He 
looked at the girl, who stared back at him. 

He grinned, &quot;I&#39;ve finally found you!,&quot;

&quot;And?,&quot; questioned Serena, irritated. All she wanted, was to go back 
home and have her lover wrap her arms around her. &quot;Why are you so 
infatuated with me?,&quot; 

Darien grinned, &quot;You killed two of my top slayers a couple years ago. 
That&#39;s quite amazing for a child to kill such experienced slayers.

&quot;They attacked me and my girlfriend, that&#39;s a big no-no,&quot; replied 
Serena. Darien pushed himself off the wall and began to walk around the 
girl.

&quot;Ah, so that raven haired beauty is your girl?,&quot; asked Darien.

&quot;Yeah, you and your little friend hurt her,&quot; growled Serena. &quot;I could 
kill you for that. No one touches what&#39;s mine,&quot; 

Darien grinned, &quot; Relax, it was only a tranquilizer dart. She will only 
be a sleep for a couple hours and have a major headache when she 
awakes,&quot;  Serena made a small smile, pleased with hearing that Rei was 
alright.

&quot;What about the rest of the people within the home? Are they ok?,&quot; asked 
Serena.

Darien nodded, &quot; In the same state as your girl,&quot;

Serena&#39;s face held a puzzled look, &quot; Why didn&#39;t you kill them, you&#39;re a 
slayer aren&#39;t you. That is your job. To dispose of us,&quot;

Darien stopped his pacing, &quot; I had no need to kill them, they weren&#39;t in 
my way,&quot; 

&quot; Then why did you kill my mother and father?,&quot; shouted Serena. &quot; What 
did they ever do to you?,&quot;

Darien smirked, &quot;The meddled with my business. That&#39;s something you 
shouldn&#39;t do,&quot;

&quot;But they were my parents! I needed them and you just took them away 
from me and my brothers, right in front of us. You have no heart, you 
sick bastard. When I get out of here, I&#39;m going to rip your head off!,&quot; 
exclaimed Serena.

&quot;What about you? You&#39;re just blood sucking monster, with no feelings. 
Your kind took my father from me, you&#39;ll deserve to die,&quot; shouted 
Darien.

&quot;So you judge every vampire over something one did?,&quot; exclaimed  Serena. 
&quot;Believe me, we have just as much feelings as humans do. With have to go 
through hell to survive in this blasted world. Where people shun on us 
because we&#39;re different. We have to hide, because we&#39;re afraid of being 
killed by some stupid slayer. You don&#39;t think it hurts when someone 
looks at us as if we&#39;re monsters, some demon that came from hell? We 
cant help the way we are. We do what we do because that&#39;s the way we 
are, it&#39;s our lifestyle and I cant see why you people can&#39;t accept that. 
If you really look, you would find some real nice and kind hearted 
vampires out their, but no, you just want to ram your stakes into our 
chests, because you love the feel of it. To us, you&#39;re the monsters!,&quot; 
shouted Serena, face turning red in anger.

Darien stared at the girl stunned. He sure as hell wasn&#39;t expecting such 
a response. He never really looked from a vampires point of view. Darien 
looked back at the girl, and Serena stared at the floor, chest heaving. 

&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry about your parents, but I can&#39;t, will not, forgive your 
kind, for what the did to my father,&quot; with that, Darien walked out of 
the room and slammed it shut. 

&quot;Same to you,&quot; whispered Serena, as she was left alone in the dark.
