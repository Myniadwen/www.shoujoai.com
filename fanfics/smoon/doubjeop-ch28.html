As the doors parted before her, Dark Sailor Saturn could see the Queen sitting upon her 
elaborate throne, lost in her own scheming. Trista stopped a safe distance from her, 
waiting for acknowledgment before speaking. Such was, of course, standard procedure. 
Usually Beryl did not keep her waiting long, though it was not unheard of for her to make 
many others, those less worthy of her attention, wait for hours.

To control her patience, Trista continued to fine tune her own plans. The beginnings of 
encounters were almost never planned out much because it was never known which of the 
Senshi the teleporter would track onto first, and it was impossible to choose the 
environment. The best course of action was to wait until the device tracked onto the senshi 
they were after. The wait was tedious at times, but it was worth it as far as strategy was 
concerned.

After several minutes of silence, Dark Saturn let out a sigh, trying to ignore the fact she 
had still not been addressed yet. No one else was here, thus the queen was apparently 
trying to test her in some way. Despite feeling it was a childish gesture on Beryl&#39;s part, 
Trista quietly reminded herself that the woman was not one to be trifled with.

More time passed.

Unable to stand being ignored any longer, Trista decided to get Beryl&#39;s attention as 
politely as she could. She knelt down before Beryl, looking at the ground before carefully 
saying, &quot;I respectfully request an audience with you, my Queen.&quot; In return, Beryl continued 
to sit upon her throne, eyes looking through her servant as if she weren&#39;t even there.

Trista looked up at Beryl and said questioningly, &quot;Revered ruler?&quot; When Beryl didn&#39;t so 
much as blink, Trista stood up. No longer willing to wait, and unable to keep her 
displeasure out of her voice she said, &quot;With your permission, I am going to take a team of 
Sekkou and--.&quot;

Before Trista could finish, Beryl made a small gesture with one of her fingers toward her 
kneeling servant. Dark Sailor Europa stepped out of the shadows from behind Beryl and 
wordlessly tossed her javelin through the air, throwing Trista back and pinning her against 
the wall.

The Sekkou of Death glanced at the javelin stuck in the shoulder of her uniform and then to 
its owner while asking smugly, &quot;I thought it was never supposed to miss?&quot; Then more 
seriously to Beryl, &quot;What&#39;s the meaning of this?&quot;

&quot;Dark Sailor Europa is a most loyal servant. Silent, patient, obedient and totally 
submissive to me. She did not miss, but hit the mark she was ordered to,&quot; Beryl said as she 
rose and gracefully walked toward Trista. &quot;My pet has been instructed to give you a 
warning, Dark Saturn, leader of my precious and loyal Sekkou. Her message is a simple 
reminder during your rise in power and influence from within my court. Simply put, do not 
forget who you serve. That is the mistake your predecessor made.&quot;

With a yank, Trista ripped the weapon out of the wall, freeing herself. Then she dropped it 
on the ground and said quietly, &quot;I need no such warning, my Lady.&quot; With an exaggerated bow, 
she continued, &quot;I live merely to serve.&quot;

&quot;Then you will have no trouble bringing Europa with you on a field test,&quot; Beryl said with a 
smile.

&quot;With all due respect, I do not know if she will respond to my orders . . . &quot; Stepping 
close to Makoto, Trista snapped her fingers in front of the taller woman&#39;s face. When 
Makoto didn&#39;t so much as blink, Dark Sailor Saturn said, &quot;. . . or if she even hears me.&quot;

Beryl laughed. &quot;Europa is a complete automaton. She obeys all orders without question, 
feeling or remorse, so long as they are in my interests. I believe you will find her to be 
quite effective in aiding you. Now go, deal those meddlesome fools a crushing blow and 
return one step closer to victory.&quot;

The Senshi had decided it was best they report Makoto to the authorities as missing, and do 
their best to live out their daily lives as if nothing happened while they wait for the 
inevitable next attack. Until then, they all agreed the best thing to do was to try to 
maintain a normal routine.

Once the Senshi of the outer rim planets were alone though, Haruka, Michiru, and Hotaru had 
far more to say about it to Setsuna. To the best of her recollection, it had been the first 
time she could remember Haruka getting upset with her. She had accused her of knowing ahead 
of time, and was furious that she hadn&#39;t given them so much as a hint about what was to 
come.

Of course, she was correct. When Setsuna informed her of that, only Michiru was able to 
save Setsuna from Haruka&#39;s wrath. It was the first time in a long time she could recall 
being surprised by something.

Setsuna had thought that at the least, Sailor Uranus would not only understand that she 
wouldn&#39;t tell them the future, but had even expected her to take it in stride. However over 
the years, both unofficial groups of Senshi had formed a closer relationship than they&#39;d 
possessed in the past, and until that moment, it simply hadn&#39;t occurred to her that her 
companions would react the way they had.

Somehow, it was Hotaru&#39;s silence on the matter that was the sharpest blow of all.

For the large part, once they had calmed down, Haruka and Michiru had begrudgingly come to 
terms with the fact that Setsuna had only been doing what she had to in order to protect 
the future. But it hadn&#39;t escaped her notice that Hotaru had become quieter, primarily when 
Setsuna was anywhere in the area.

Out of all three of them, Hotaru was the one who seemed to be doing her best holding a 
grudge and keeping her distance from Setsuna. Haruka had tried to tell her that it was 
probably just Hotaru &#39;being a typical moody kid&#39;, but Setsuna wasn&#39;t so certain.

As much as she didn&#39;t like it, Setsuna hoped Hotaru&#39;s small act of rebellion would help 
make the near future easier on the girl.

By now cooler heads had prevailed and things had largely calmed down in there household. 
The arguing and finger pointing had lessened, and over the last two days they had finally 
started eating together again.

For now however, none of it mattered. All that mattered to Setsuna at this very moment, was 
breakfast.

As she thought about it, it was like any other morning in her life since she started living 
with her three companions. As usual, she was the first out of bed, long before sunrise. She 
didn&#39;t feel strange or anxious at all. For her own personal reasons, she found this 
amusing.

Setsuna poured herself another cup of coffee, then quietly went back to reading yesterday&#39;s 
paper since today&#39;s had yet to arrive. She turned the pages absently, lost in her own 
thoughts. She took a bite of her toast, then put it back down on the plate. Her expression 
remained blank as she stared at the black print absently.

While re-reading the &#39;latest&#39; on yesterday&#39;s news about Tokyo&#39;s politics, she said to 
herself, &quot;My one regret is that I didn&#39;t do more to encourage Hotaru to have more of a 
social life.&quot;

&quot;Decaffeinated coffee and toast.&quot; She shook her head gently as a faint smile spread across 
her lips. &quot;I suppose most would choose something a touch more extravagant, but it will do. 
Besides, sometimes comfort is found in the ordinary.&quot; Then she brought her cup of coffee 
back to her lips, took another sip . . .

And mid way through returning it to the table, she froze as the light caught it just right, 
allowing her reflection to dimly appear in the warm liquid just for an instant.

She slowly lowered the warm mug to the table as she said absently, &quot;You&#39;re watching me 
right now . . . aren&#39;t you.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question. She simply knew this to be true. &quot;You 
are curious. You are wondering if I know . . .and yes . . . yes, I know.&quot;

She got up quietly and made her way to the doors leading to the back yard. As she flipped 
on the backyard lights and stepped out onto the deck, she looked around absently for a 
moment.

They&#39;d added an interesting small koi pond, and the landscaping hid the wall that muffled 
the sound of the highway to the point it was hardly noticed. Memories of the many social 
gatherings she&#39;d shared with all of the Senshi, as well as other friends came flooding back 
to her as she stood there.

She shook her head to clear her mind, reminding herself that she hadn&#39;t come here to think. 
She had come here to have an . . . interesting conversation. She leaned over the deck&#39;s 
railing, and looked down, straight into her own reflection as it gazed back up at her from 
the koi pond.

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; she said softly to her own reflection in the water, &quot;I know your future. All too 
well, as a matter of fact.&quot;

As if reacting to her comment, her reflection rippled a bit from a soft gust of wind in the 
still morning air.

She narrowed her eyes as she listened to unheard voices. After a moment, she said, &quot;Then 
allow me to be the first to tell you. You will yet live to regret many, many things which 
you have done and have yet to do before you meet your end.&quot;

This time, Setsuna watched as her reflection&#39;s expression changed unmistakably to one of 
pure rage. Lips moved as Trista spoke behind clenched teeth. Despite the fact her words 
could not be heard, Setsuna knew what was said.

Setsuna nodded her head absently, and answered, &quot;So be it. But if I may be so bold, a word 
of advice before we allow the days events to unfold. I suggest you heed them well, for I 
promise you, you will one day come to rue the day you first heard them.&quot;

The Senshi of Time leaned over the railing and said, &quot;The biggest problem with knowing 
one&#39;s self . . . is that deep down, you know when you are wrong.&quot;

Minako glanced at the clock on the wall and took the last sip from her soda then said into 
her headset&#39;s mike, &quot;This is Minako in the Morning on WKLTX 103.5. What you just heard was 
the song &#39;Yume Miru Dakeja Dame&#39;, and you are lucky caller number twelve! What&#39;s your 
name!&quot;

&quot;What? I won? Wow! This is incredible! Uh . . . sorry, it&#39;s just this kind of thing never 
happens to me. My name is Kunihiko Ikuhara.&quot;

&quot;Mmm hmm, and do you know what you&#39;ve won?&quot;

&quot;Yes! A trip for three to Tokyo Disneyland! I&#39;m so excited! I&#39;ll be bringing--&quot;

Minako cut the man off and said cheerfully, &quot;And what&#39;s your favorite music station?&quot;

Kunihiko swooned, &quot;Woo-Hoo! WKLTX 103.5 with you, Minako, this morning and every morning! 
Yes!&quot;

Minako pressed a button, transferring the man back to the studio&#39;s main switch board so 
they could get the necessary information from him then said, &quot;That&#39;s right! You be sure to 
tell all your friends! We&#39;ll be back after this commercial break. With our next game name 
that tune, where we play portions of a cartoon&#39;s opening credits in reverse and the first 
one to call in wins a free car wash at any Shell Station of your choice, and dinner for two 
at Tokyo Midtown.&quot; She then flipped the audio over to the commercial track.

The moment she did, she instantly lost the happy go lucky tone to her voice. She pressed 
another switch and said to her manager &quot;These morning people are crazy, Yoshioka. I&#39;m 
taking a break, be back in 5.&quot; Before he could protest to her over the headset, she set it 
down on her switchboard and stepped out of the small room.

The sun was just coming up as she entered the alley behind the radio station. That meant 
that Hotaru, and at least one of her parents were up by now getting ready for the day.

There was a time when she had liked her job, but after Makoto had &#39;gone missing&#39;, it had 
become far less enjoyable, and more difficult to go through the morning routine. Even more 
so, since she had to put on a constant &#39;happy face&#39; for her listening audience when inside 
she was screaming.

The routine had become frustrating for all of them. The constant living life as if nothing 
was wrong thing was maddening while grieving for their friend, as well as knowing they 
could be attacked at any moment. Maddening,oppressive, and downright boring.

All except Ami. By now, Ami was almost certainly awake, preparing to return to work even 
though that was two days away. The Senshi of Ice was in so much denial that she&#39;d even 
started packing the night before in preparation for moving in with Makoto as the two had 
talked about, totally convinced Makoto was still alive and that it was just a &#39;matter of 
time before they got her back.&#39;

If Minako didn&#39;t know any better, she&#39;d have sworn the bluenette even had a plan.

&quot;She&#39;s not coming back, Ami.&quot; Minako whispered to herself. Despite witnessing her death, 
Ami was the only one of them who just didn&#39;t accept that Makoto was gone for good. She just 
kept babbling on about her scientific theories. The rest of them largely ignored her, and. 
. . were frustrated.

Frustrated because they were powerless to change anything, couldn&#39;t convince her to accept 
reality, and that they couldn&#39;t bring the fight to the enemy.

In some ways, the Sekkou were very much like any other number of monsters the Senshi had 
fought. They showed up at random, caused destruction, then retreated to a place that no one 
could reach. This had never bothered them about their previous enemies, but the personal 
way the Sekkou tended to attack at their very lives and use their minds against them, as 
well as the loss of Makoto made all of them, except Ami, almost impatient for the next 
fight, if nothing else, just to get it over with.

Some of the lights flickered off as the sun became brighter, either on automatic timers or 
light sensors. As the light above the studio&#39;s alley door flicked off Minako sighed. One 
more minute until she had to head back to putting on her fake happy face to entertain the 
world for its own amusement. Not for the first time of late, Minako wished something would 
happen to prevent her from having to go back.

Resigned to her fate, Minako turned around, heading back inside.

Just before she reached the door, her Senshi communicator began to chime, notifying her of 
an incoming message.

&quot;Come out come out, wherever you are.&quot; Dark Sailor Moon whispered to herself as she 
strolled through the darkened garage, in search of her prey. &quot;I know you&#39;re hiding in here, 
little Hotaru. Come out and I&#39;ll promise to make your death as painless as possible.&quot;

A sound from behind caused her to spin around, but the only movement she saw was a 
screwdriver rolling slowly to a stop, after apparently falling off a work bench. Growling 
in frustration, Serena turned back around to continue her search.

There was a loud whooshing sound as Sailor Saturn brought her glaive around, smacking Dark 
Moon right in the stomach, causing the other to double over.

Hotaru didn&#39;t wait for a reply before running out of the garage to find a different hiding 
place. She opened the nearest closet she could find, and ducked in before closing the door 
silently. She pressed herself far back between the winter coats, pulling them in front of 
her to hide herself as much as possible. She stopped moving just in time to hear foot steps 
coming close.

Because she couldn&#39;t see, Hotaru wasn&#39;t sure who had thrown the closet door open. She 
didn&#39;t dare move though. After whoever it was had decided they hadn&#39;t seen her, the door 
closed.

She could hear Dark Sailor Mars say to someone, &quot;Find her yet? . . . She&#39;s got to be here 
somewhere. Keep looking!&quot;

Once she heard the footsteps moving away she allowed herself to breath a sigh of relief. 
She&#39;d heard the commotion in the backyard and looked out the window long enough to see the 
fight between her parents and several Sekkou going on, and snuck off long enough to call 
the other Senshi. Ami had advised her to hide until they got there to help and that&#39;s 
exactly what she&#39;d been doing. However she&#39;d had several close calls, and it was becoming 
more and more difficult to stay out of sight.

She had pushed the coats aside and was just about to leave the closet when the door flew 
open again without warning. Hotaru opened her mouth to yell out, when the woman in front of 
her covered her mouth with her hand, holding up a finger in front of her own, motioning for 
her to be quiet. Then she pushed Hotaru back into the closet, stepped in and closed the 
door behind them.

&quot;It&#39;s me, Hotaru,&quot; whispered Michiru. &quot;Haruka-Papa and Setsuna-Mama are trying to draw some 
of them away.&quot; Moving her hand away she said quietly, &quot;We&#39;re going to make a run for it.&quot;

Sailor Saturn was about to protest, when Sailor Neptune said, &quot;Don&#39;t argue with me. When I 
give the signal, I want you to run until you find Haruka-Papa. Do not stop for anything. Do 
you understand?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the signal?&quot; whispered Saturn.

Dark Moon was making one more sweep of the house before she began searching outside. She 
was almost back to the garage, when she noticed a bright flash of light inside a closet. 
She stepped forward, and reached for the handle, whispering eagerly, &quot;Gotcha now you 
little--&quot;

The next thing she was aware of was the door being blown off it&#39;s hinges, and then the roar 
of water as it crashed into her, throwing her to the ground. Before she could get up, she 
felt Sailor Saturn stepping on her body, putting all her weight on Serena&#39;s head, pressing 
it into the ground as she continued running back to the garage. Then Dark Moon got trampled 
by Sailor Neptune on her way in the same direction.

Groaning as she pealed her face off the floor, she yelled &quot;They&#39;re back in the garage!&quot; 
Before she could fully get to her feet, Dark Mars and Jupiter came storming down the hall 
at top speed. Serena had just enough time to roll over and start to protest before they too 
stomped on her in there hurry to catch up with the two Senshi.

Swearing under her breath after being trampled by her own team mates, Dark Moon got up and 
limped after them complaining all the way. When she caught up with them, they had made 
their way back to the garage.

&quot;Why are you two just standing there?&quot; she demanded as she pushed between the two. Once she 
could see past them, the automatic garage door started to open, and she said angrily, &quot; . . 
. No . . .&quot;

Rei said cheerfully, &quot;What do you know? For once we outnumber them!&quot;

&quot;We have a problem with people who beat up others on the street, but when you come into 
someone&#39;s home without knocking to cause harm, it&#39;s sure to get our attention! In the name 
of the moon, we will punish you!&quot;

&quot;So will I, guardian of ice, Sailor Mercury!&quot;

&quot;As will I, Sailor Neptune, acting gracefully!&quot;

Ray scrunched up her face in irritation. &quot;At least there&#39;s not more of you. I think I&#39;d 
have died having to listen to any more--.&quot;

Dark moon glared at her enemies as she said, &quot;How dare you interrupt us while trying to 
achieve our goals! Our lives are hard enough without you constantly getting in our way! In 
the name of her majesty, we&#39;ll crush you!&quot; Then she made a gesture with her hand and 
yelled, &quot;Punishing Heart Attack!&quot;

Dark energy flew from her fingertips, blasting the four Senshi off their feet and out of 
her way, as well as taking off the front of the garage. Before she could admire her 
handiwork, she noticed Hotaru running full speed down the street away from them.

The three Sekkou ran past the disoriented Senshi intending on overpowering the youth, when 
a car came around the corner and stopped next to Sailor Saturn long enough for her to climb 
in before taking off at high speed.

&quot;Why don&#39;t they ever just give up?&quot; complained Dark Jupiter.

As the three Sekkou lifted off the ground and started flying after the car, Dark Mars 
sighed and said, &quot;Well Serena. . . at least your speech was better.&quot;

&quot;I take it they&#39;re in the house?&quot; asked Minako as she steered the car around a corner.

&quot;Yes. We need to double back. Michiru-Mama says that Haruka-Papa and Setsuna-Mama need 
help.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t the way back home, Minako-Chan.&quot;

&quot;I know where I&#39;m going,&quot; Minako replies, &quot;I passed them on the way to your house.&quot;

Minako sped up the on ramp, nearly running into a mini van as she merged onto the highway. 
Meanwhile her young passenger double checked her seatbelt was fastened before saying 
anxiously, &quot;Oh no! Not again!&quot;

They never even saw the first attack from the pursuing Sekkou, but they did see the ground 
in front of the car explode in front of them.

Minako&#39;s defensive driving skills weren&#39;t on par with Haruka&#39;s, and it showed. Unable to 
react fast enough to go around the crater, both women screamed as Minako drove her car 
right into it. The impact was so sudden to Minako that it sounded like a sharp pop more 
than a crash as the front of her car fell several feet, colliding against the side of the 
crater, cracking the windshield and crushing the engine like a can.

Hotaru shook her head, then looked around the shattered car to regain her senses. At first 
she thought a long time must have passed, since it seemed dark. As her vision cleared, she 
noticed the darkness was caused by a spaghetti noodle of bridges above them partially 
blocking out the sun.

The airbag slowly deflated, and she saw that Minako had been knocked unconscious. Realizing 
that for the moment there was nothing she could do for the blonde, Sailor Saturn unbuckled 
her seat belt and carefully climbed out of the shattered passenger side window.

A little farther down the highway, Haruka was involved in a re-match with her double. After 
narrowly dodging a punch, she fired off an attack at Dark Neptune at point blank range, 
sending the woman flying back several feet, giving her time to re-group with Setsuna and 
Mamoru.

It also gave Dark Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune, Mercury, and Venus time to form a nice 
neat circle around the three, and the other three Sekkou that had been chasing the car 
enough time to join them as well. They could see the rest of the Senshi sprinting to catch 
up, but they were far enough down the highway that it would be some time yet before they&#39;d 
be able to join in the fight.

Tuxedo Mask said, &quot;I don&#39;t get it. They have us outnumbered two to one . . . make that 
three to one out here. Why don&#39;t they just finish us off already?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re toying with us.&quot; growled Sailor Uranus.

&quot;No,&quot; Setsuna replied calmly, &quot;They&#39;re waiting for something.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but what?&quot;

Before anyone could form an answer, one of the Sekkou fired at the group of heroes, causing 
the three to scatter again and renew the fight. Once again, the odds changed.

Changed . . . for the worse.

Sailor Uranus had just enough time to regain her footing when she reflexively blocked yet 
another gloved hand aiming for her jaw. Haruka&#39;s block caused her opponent to leave her 
stomach wide open. Wasting no time in taking advantage of her opponent&#39;s misstep, Haruka 
delivered a well placed kick, causing the other woman to double over.

Cracking her knuckles, Haruka said smugly to the tall white and black clad Sekkou, &quot;Yeah, 
Makoto used to make the same mistake all the time. She never did quite get the concept of 
defending her stomach for some reason.&quot;

The tall Sekkou rose to her feet and looked at Haruka in a way that brought chills down her 
spine. The expression on the woman&#39;s face wasn&#39;t angry or full of rage like their 
expression usually was. It didn&#39;t even look pained or winded from the blow she&#39;d just 
received. There wasn&#39;t anything in it. Her face appeared to almost be doll like in its lack 
of life. It was that soulless absence of . . . everything . . . in the other&#39;s face that 
made Haruka feel uneasy.

&quot;Europa!&quot;, bellowed Dark Saturn, &quot;Stop wasting time with her and get over here!&quot;

Mindlessly, the woman turned and started walking away from Haruka as if she weren&#39;t even 
there.

&quot;Oh no. You&#39;re not getting away from me that easy!&quot; Sailor Uranus ran at the Sekkou and 
leapt into the air in a perfect jump kick aimed squarely at the Sekkou&#39;s middle back. When 
the woman didn&#39;t even seem to try to move out of the way, Haruka almost felt sorry for her 
when she hit her target perfectly, sending her crashing flat on her face.

Previous fights with the Sekkou had taught her not to give them a second&#39;s respite, so 
without hesitation, Haruka jammed her knee with all of her weight in the same place her 
kick had hit moments ago, pinning the strange woman to the ground.

It had to be extremely painful, but the woman remained eerily quiet, and didn&#39;t even try to 
raise a hand to push her off. She just kept moving her hands and legs, trying to crawl 
away, seemingly oblivious to the pain and the fact that she couldn&#39;t get up far enough to 
move without doing something about the person on top of her.

This time, Dark Saturn walked up to the two from behind, watching for a moment as Sailor 
Uranus begin landing blow after blow on her victim remorselessly. &quot;Beryl wasn&#39;t kidding. 
You really do follow orders to the letter.&quot;

With a sweep of her weapon, Trista swung at Haruka. It was only years of experience that 
allowed the Senshi to dodge the sudden attack by rolling to the side away from the two.

Dark Saturn looked the Sekkou up and down disapprovingly as Dark Europa pushed herself up 
off the ground. &quot;That&#39;s enough Makoto. Our target has presented itself and it is time to 
see if your aim is as good as Queen Beryl says. Prove yourself to me. Defend yourself if 
need be, but it&#39;s time to go after our objective. Understand?&quot;

&quot;Makoto?&quot; Haruka said, startled by what she&#39;d just overheard and as the pieces fell into 
place in her mind.

With a practiced jump, Haruka threw herself back on her feet, ran up behind Makoto, grabbed 
her, and spun her around. Staring right into her friend&#39;s vacant expression, Haruka shook 
the taller woman by her shoulders and said, &quot;Come on kid, snap out of it! It&#39;s me, remem-- 
AH!&quot;

Without so much as a thought, Dark Sailor Europa calmly grabbed Sailor Uranus&#39;s right hand, 
and twisted just hard enough to break her friend&#39;s wrist, then let go as the woman fell to 
the ground in surprise and pain. She silently watched just long enough to be sure she would 
not interfere with her further.

Then as Haruka looked on, a long black javelin formed in Makoto&#39;s hands. Ignoring the fight 
raging around them between the other Sekkou and Senshi, she held the staff expertly, aiming 
it. When Haruka saw who Makoto was aiming at she forced herself to her feet and yelled an 
incoherent scream of rage and despair.

Before she did it though, she knew there was no way she&#39;d reach Makoto in time to stop her.

Still rather dazed from the car accident, Sailor Saturn yelped in surprise as she felt 
someone yank her to her feet.

&quot;You alright?&quot; asked Michiru as she looked her daughter over.

&quot;Yes, but Minako&#39;s unconscious.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go check on her.&quot; said Ami as she made her way down to the car.

Just audible over the fight, they heard Haruka yell, &quot;No!&quot;

Everyone looked up just in time to see Sailor Europa the instant she threw the javelin in 
the air. It flew so fast, that at first no one was sure where it had gone. Then Hotaru let 
out a soft gasp.

&quot;Oh my god . . .&quot;, Whispered Michiru as she looked at Sailor Saturn.

The look on the girl&#39;s face was one of total shock. Hotaru had her hands wrapped around the 
javelin, which was perfectly lined with her heart. She couldn&#39;t even bring herself to look 
down at it. Horrified, she gasped out, &quot;I . . . Mama . . . Papa!&quot;

Ami screamed, &quot;Check for an exit wound!&quot; as she turned away from the car and climbed out of 
the crater as quickly as she could.

Rei carefully held Hotaru as she said, &quot;It&#39;s O.K. , It&#39;s O.K. . . . just move your hands so 
we can-- HA HA!&quot; Rei looked up practically laughing as she said &quot;She&#39;s O.K.! Look! She&#39;s 
alright!&quot;

Hotaru let go of the weapon and backed away, revealing the smallest puncture in her 
uniform.

&quot;See?&quot;, said Rei, relieved, as Michiru pulled her daughter close, &quot;She managed to catch it! 
Maybe a scratch if that. Wow, Haruka, I&#39;m impressed. I thought you were a goner.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Usagi nervously, &quot;but why is it still in the air?&quot;

Ami turned her head, alternating between looking at Hotaru and the javelin, before 
switching her visor on to examine it. Instead of clattering to the ground when Hotaru let 
go of the weapon, it stayed right in the air.

&quot;That is strange . . . the way gravity is working on it, it should still be moving. It is 
not giving out any power readings or anything, it . . . it is just . . .&quot; then Ami gasped, 
&quot;Oh no! It is not the weapon at all! It&#39;s time! Time has . . . &quot;

As realization dawned on them, Hotaru and Michiru followed by Rei, Usagi, and Ami, ran 
toward the fight going on down the street. A fight that had become strangely quiet only 
moments before.

Haruka lay on the ground, still clutching her arm as she looked up at Setsuna. &quot;. . . I 
don&#39;t know whether to thank you or curse you at the moment.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; was Setsuna&#39;s reply. She was surrounded by a blinding light as she held 
her key staff delicately, almost uncertainly. She possessed none of her usual confidence.

&quot;Setsuna mama! No! Don&#39;t do it!&quot; cried Hotaru as she ran up to Sailor Pluto.

As the girl wrapped her arms around Setsuna, the Senshi of Time said quietly, &quot;It&#39;s all 
right . . . don&#39;t worry. You&#39;re safe now. That&#39;s what matters.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that! Don&#39;t you say that! There&#39;s got to be something we can do!&quot; sobbed Sailor 
Saturn.

Michiru looked at Setsuna, unsure of what to say. Setsuna nodded slowly in response, and 
Michiru took that as her way of saying &#39;It&#39;s all right, it had to be done.&#39;

Michiru put her hand on Hotaru&#39;s shoulder and said quietly, &quot;Come on . . . it&#39;s too late. 
You . . . we have to let her go.&quot;

In response, Hotaru held on tighter and cried, &quot;But you came back last time, right? They 
said you came back after you did this last time. I&#39;ll see you again, right?&quot;

Not letting go of her staff, Setsuna said softly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Hotaru.&quot; Then she looked up 
at the rest of the senshi and said, &quot;Go. We&#39;ve done all we can here.&quot;

Before anyone moved, there was an ear piercing scream from a few yards away. All of the 
Senshi other than Hotaru turned to to see where the sound had come from.

&quot;That&#39;s right, I forgot.&quot; Setsuna looked at Dark Sailor Pluto without pity. &quot;Didn&#39;t anyone 
tell you? If time stops in the dimension you&#39;re in . . . the gods make no distinction on 
who actually stopped it.&quot;

&quot;Screw you, you bitch!&quot; screeched the young looking Sekkou. She looked at Dark Saturn and 
then at Sailor Pluto angrily and growled, &quot;You planned this from the beginning you two 
timing double crossing little cra--&quot; She tried to throw her glowing time staff on the 
ground. The second it left her hands, it stopped in mid air, and she froze, a look of 
terror and rage permanently stuck on her face.

&quot;The resulting explosion from both myself and Dark Pluto will almost certainly take out 
some of the Sekkou. Look on the bright side. Things will be more even the next time you see 
them.&quot; Then to Hotaru, she said quietly, &quot;And . . . I&#39;m sorry. I couldn&#39;t let anything 
happen to you. It&#39;s all I can say.&quot;

Ami looked at Makoto, frozen just as she had been mere seconds after tossing her javelin at 
Hotaru. &quot;Is . . . is that Mako-chan? Will . . . will she be all right?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no time. As strange as it sounds, I can only stop time for so long.&quot; Setsuna took 
one last breath before she closed her eyes as the light surrounding her became brighter. 
&quot;Now go.&quot;

The Senshi saw a bright flash of light, and before any of them could say anything more, the 
senshi, including an unconscious Minako,minus Setsuna and Mamoru, were safely in front of 
Haruka and Michiru&#39;s house. A few moments later, there was a tremendous explosion in the 
distance, followed by a gut wrenching silence.
