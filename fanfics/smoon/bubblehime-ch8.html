<h1>Bubblegum Hime (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bubblehime-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Rena Sayers paused as she got out of the car, her long brown hair 
flowing around her shoulders. The attractive young woman took off her 
sunglasses as she looked around the parking lot of Fuka Academy, taking 
in the vehicles as she thought of her first step.

&#39;I&#39;ll have to talk to Smith,&#39; Rena thought with some distaste, &#39;then I 
should have a better idea where to look.&#39; A quick call on the cellphone 
and she had arranged a meeting at a restaurant not far from the campus.

The orange haired girl in a waitress outfit smiled cheerfully, &quot;Welcome 
to the Lindem Baum, My name is Mai Tokhia, and I&#39;ll be serving you 
today.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Mai,&quot; Rena said wryly as she settled into a table across from 
the blonde haired Mr Smith. &quot;Could I just have a cola to start with?&quot; 
she asked.

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Mai beamed as she hurried away.

After Mai returned with the drink Rena thanked her, then turned to 
Smith. &quot;Isn&#39;t this a bit public?&quot; she asked quietly.

The slightly weasel-looking Smith turned to watch the waitresses 
hurrying by with orders. &quot;This isn&#39;t a spy novel, Miss Sayers,&quot; he noted 
calmly, &quot;having secret, furtive meetings would draw more attention than 
this.&quot;

Rena frowned slightly but had to concede he had a point. &quot;You told Nagi 
you found her,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;and she&#39;s here at the academy?&quot;

&quot;Natsuki Kuga,&quot; Smith agreed as he took out a expensive personal 
organizer from his suit pocket. Manipulating the device a moment he 
passed it over, &quot;Take a look.&quot;

Rena&#39;s eyes widened as she took in the young woman in a Fuka school 
uniform, her long black hair shimmering in the sun. She looked confident 
striding across the campus, a hard, dangerous look in her eyes. The 
resemblance to a younger Saeko Kuga was almost eerie.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Rena found herself murmuring.

Smith nodded slightly as he noted, &quot;Even if I knew nothing about her, I 
could tell Natsuki and Saeko were related.&quot;

Rena nodded slightly. &quot;What&#39;s her situation?&quot; she asked quietly.

&quot;She&#39;s receiving some support from her father,&quot; Smith said, &quot;it was 
partially because I traced it that I found her. She&#39;s also getting a 
partial scholarship from Mashiro.&quot;

&quot;As we suspected,&quot; Rena nodded her agreement as she cynically added, 
&quot;the better to keep some leverage on Natsuki.&quot;

&quot;Quite possibly,&quot; Smith agreed. He cycled through files on the organizer 
as he sorted through the data, &quot;While not the most social person, there 
are several people she&#39;s been seen associating with.&quot;

Rena clicked through the files, blinking in surprise a moment as she 
took in one photo, &quot;Our waitress?&quot;

Smith chuckled, &quot;Part of why I chose here to meet.&quot;

Still looking at the various faces Rena asked hesitantly, &quot;Is she 
romantically attached?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; it was Smith who hesitated this time, &quot;to Shizuru Fujino, the 
student council president. Her photo&#39;s the one just after Natsuki&#39;s.&quot;

&#39;A woman?&#39; Rena mused as she looked at the smiling, purple eyed woman 
thoughtfully. &#39;Makes you wonder if this preference is genetic,&#39; she 
thought wryly. She looked up at Smith, &quot;Do they seem happy?&quot;

Smith&#39;s smile was amused as he said, &quot;If the noise complaints from 
Fujino&#39;s neighbors are accurate, very happy.&quot;

Rena blinked at him in surprise, &quot;Smith!&quot;

Smith laughed, &quot;The noise complaint to the police is in my written 
report.&quot;

Rena shook her head wryly, trying not to laugh too as she read the full 
text file. Apparently Natsuki was a bit of a delinquent, skipping 
certain classes. She rode a motorbike and lived off campus, though was 
also likely to stay over with her girlfriend who lived in Fuka. She was 
a member at a shooting range and was quite fond of mayo.

&quot;Mayo?&quot; Rena looked at Smith, wondering how he found that little detail 
out.

&quot;I watched her eating here one time,&quot; Smith shuddered slightly. &quot;She 
even puts mayo on her bowl of ramen....&quot; he sighed.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Rena chuckled. She looked out the window, her expression 
thoughtful, &quot;How would you suggest contacting her?&quot;

Smith thought about it for a few moments, &quot;Directly or indirectly?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Rena admitted, not going into how conflicted she felt. 
Part of her wanted to arrange a meeting between Natsuki and Saeko, but 
she also knew how complicated such a meeting would be. Saeko would have 
to explain where she had been since faking her death, and why she had 
done that to Natsuki.

&quot;You could attempt to join the shooting range,&quot; Smith offered, &quot;or if 
you prefer a more direct method, I understand Fuka Academy is hiring 
teachers.&quot;

Rena looked at him in surprise then said, &quot;There&#39;s no way they&#39;d hire 
me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I think we could arrange something,&quot; Smith said confidently.

Alyssa Searrs sighed happily as she lay back on the bed, her chest still 
heaving as she fought to bring her pulse under control. The lovely 
blonde sprawled naked on the covers, her athletic body covered with a 
delicate sheen of sweat.

Miyu Greer rose from where she had been crouching between Alyssa&#39;s legs, 
licking her lips with a smile. The blue haired woman lay beside Alyssa, 
looking at her tenderly as she asked, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m more than all right,&quot; Alyssa kissed her gently as she pulled Miyu 
close to her, &quot;I feel fantastic.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Miyu cuddled close to the slightly smaller woman. It was 
odd, most of the time you didn&#39;t notice Alyssa was smaller because of 
her supreme self confidence, but relaxed like this it was very evident.

Alyssa rested her cheek against Miyu&#39;s breast, breathing in the sweet, 
clean scent of her skin. Some might argue that Miyu wasn&#39;t human, with 
her computer brain and cybernetic enhancements, but Alyssa knew she had 
a heart and soul just like anyone else.

&#39;Just like anyone other than Nagi,&#39; Alyssa made a face, sighing softly.

Miyu stroked Alyssa&#39;s hair gently, looking down at her fondly, &quot;Is there 
something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Nagi,&quot; Alyssa sighed. &quot;He&#39;s trying to develop a humanoid model orphan.&quot;

Miyu tensed a bit, then let herself relax. &quot;How dangerous could that be 
to the plan?&quot; she asked Alyssa, her mind already racing.

&quot;Very,&quot; Alyssa said flatly. &quot;If he develops the humanoid orphan, our own 
plans could be seriously impacted.&quot;

&quot;Should we start to take steps?&quot; Miyu asked, reaching over to the 
bedside table for her glasses. While appearing to be ordinary spectacles 
they assisted Miyu in accessing and sorting data, much like a 
traditional computer interface device.

Alyssa fought back a smile at the odd image of her naked lover with her 
proper looking glasses on. &quot;I want you to monitor the work,&quot; Alyssa said 
thoughtfully, &quot;hack into the research and development labs.&quot;

&quot;And if they appear close to succeeding?&quot; Miyu asked seriously.

&quot;We&#39;ll do what we have to,&quot; Alyssa said.

They both knew the dangers of allowing Nagi&#39;s work to progress too far. 
SEARRS had it&#39;s own interests in the creation of bioengineered life and 
a plan that had been in development for centuries. They could not allow 
a upstart like Nagi to interfere....

&quot;Miss Alyssa,&quot; Miyu murmured as she caressed her cheek, &quot;don&#39;t worry. I 
won&#39;t let anything go wrong.&quot;

Alyssa smiled, glad to be knocked free of her dark thoughts. &quot;Thank you, 
Miyu,&quot; she said, leaning forward to kiss her gently. &quot;I wish we could 
stay here all day,&quot; she admitted softly.

Miyu smiled suddenly, &quot;Shall I clear your days appointments, then?&quot;

Alyssa felt herself smiling back, &quot;And what would you suggest we do 
instead?&quot;

Miyu let her finger trail down from Alyssa&#39;s cheek to her chest, then 
down to her belly button. &quot;Well, first I think I&#39;ll wash you off... with 
my tongue.&quot;

Alyssa shivered, her nipples hardening, &quot;And?&quot;

Miyu bit her ear gently, &quot;Then I&#39;d do my best to get you all sweaty 
again, love.&quot;

Alyssa moaned softly, her whole body suddenly tingling. &quot;Phone Nagi&#39;s 
secretary,&quot; she purred in Miyu&#39;s ear, &quot;we won&#39;t be in today..&quot;

Miyu grinned as she picked up the cordless and phoned in. Setting it 
down she kissed Alyssa again, tenderly then purred, &quot;Just lay back and 
relax.&quot;

&quot;I may be laying down,&quot; Alyssa panted, &quot;but I&#39;m not relaxed.&quot;

&quot;Wait and see,&quot; Miyu laughed as she began her delicious task.
