<a href="../smoon/sailergg-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>	The cold blanket against her body, the breeze from the window and the
view of her wife&#39;s naked body as exited the bathroom, the character of her
belly, shape of the breast, dark nipples pointing towards the ceiling. A relaxed
smile as she walked closer to the bed bringing a seductive sway to her buns.
&quot;Have you waited for me?&quot; Michiru felt like a bud ready to burst as she removed
the blanket from the spot beside her and as Haruka came closer she nearly
gasped. Felt the warm skin of her wife against hers as they kissed, lukewarm
saliva changing mouth, hot exhales from flaring nostrils and the thrill of
approaching intercourse.
	Haruka brought caress to Michiru&#39;s waist, follows it around to the back
then down. Kisses growing more intense, closeness that made sweat surface on
their skin, innocent touches that became not only pleasant but like nourishment
for the skin, feeding upon each others desire with eyes closed.
	Michiru&#39;s palm steady at Haruka&#39;s breast, cradling it carefully with
fingertips nearly trembling as her cheeks grew red. Haruka&#39;s soft embrace of the
patch between her thighs, then the wait. The wait as they both reached deep
inside for that decision, to make up their minds and finally smile. Kiss once
more before the movement below the blanket became more intimate.

Chapter 5: Midnight embrace.

	Haruka brought her fingers through Michiru&#39;s moist hair, kissed her
wife&#39;s neck time after time only to bring a smile to her lips. The cold air came
towards them from the window, traversed their naked bodies locked into a
embrace. Hot fumes of love rising from them while they remain motionless as two
clay statues against the white sheet.
	Michiru turned in the bed, faced her wife to receive a brief kiss before
she came close with her belly tight against Haruka&#39;s, felt how she was embraced
by warm arms and she leaned her head against two well rounded breast. Reached
down, tussled with the hair on the pregnant mound. &quot;If it&#39;s a girl, can I name
her Reina?&quot;
	Haruka leaned her chin against Michiru&#39;s head. &quot;But if it&#39;s a boy I&#39;ll
name him Rai.&quot; Made her embrace tighter and exhaled. &quot;But the last name?&quot; She
looked out the window. &quot;Kaioh, Tenoh, Jin?&quot;
	&quot;Can we pick Kishimo&#39;s surname?&quot; Michiru said fixing her eyes on a spot
at the base of the belly. &quot;Reina Jin, but Reina Tenoh sounds better.&quot; 
	&quot;Rai Kaioh.&quot; Was all that Haruka said and closed her eyes.
	&quot;It moved again.&quot; Michiru said while her lips grew to a smile.
	A tear slowly left Haruka&#39;s left eyes, made a quick journey down her
cheek before it reached the scalp of Michiru&#39;s hair. A second one followed and
her wife looked up at her. &quot;Something wrong?&quot;
	Haruka dried the tear away. &quot;I just wet myself.&quot; She exhaled a heavy
sigh and began moving away from her loved one and escaped the bed her posture
crippled with humiliation. Michiru got of the bed and gathered the sheet and
blanket and dragged them over to the laundry bin. Took new ones from the closet
and made the bed while she listened to the shower sounding from the bathroom.
	Michiru slipped back into the bed, waited there for her wife to return.
Finally the noise died from the bathroom and Haruka returned to the bedroom, on
her lips was strong yet careful smile, around her was a sense of sadness that
was weakened by the power of Michiru&#39;s smile. The two joined in the bed and
Haruka found herself embraced by Michiru. Dug her nose closed to the soft,
tender skin of Michiru&#39;s armpit and calmly closed eyes waited for sleep to come.
It did not. Sleep came to neither of them. The room was filled with their
breathing, movements, and Michiru who tenderly touched Haruka&#39;s back.
	Haruka was but a leaf when this close to her wife, billowing too and fro
in her heart, her mind a shifting colour as she inhaled air right of her loved
ones skin. Spent her minds valuables on the image of Michiru, enjoyed how she
was being caressed, knew that in this embrace she would always be safe.
	Michiru felt a exhale trickle down over her right breast, a slow relaxed
exhale that told her Haruka was asleep. She herself found comfort in that,
rested her lips against Haruka&#39;s forehead, the fresh taste of the skin, a
lingering sensation. A loving sigh that left her lips as she spread the blanket
over them; hid them from the eye of the night, protected them from the draught
and shielded their child.
	Time passed while they where asleep, time passed while they where
dreaming. Dreams about the babe, dreams about the future, dreams reflecting of
the past. A dream involving them at the height of age and brink of life,
supported by their two kids overlooking a garden with threes enveloped in
blossom with hanging peaches and grandchildren playing below releasing chiming
laughters from their lips. Two old women smiling as they crouch and receive the
children into their embraces, to feel soft children hair against their faces and
low voices welcoming them.
