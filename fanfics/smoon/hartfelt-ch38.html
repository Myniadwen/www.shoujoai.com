<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 38 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch37.html">Back to Part 37</a><p><u>(Rei)</u></p><p>“Huff…Huff…Huf—ahh..ah…”</p><p><i>My entire body hurts.</i></p><p>In 
the face of fatigue the proud woman forced her eyes open and squinted up at the darkness 
through hazy eyes. She hated it. She truly, undeniably, loathed it. In the beginning there 
had only been darkness. It had been everywhere she looked; as she ventured through life as a 
child she watched in disgust as that same darkness festered within the souls of men. And 
now, as she lay here as a ragged mess, was she to be forever trapped by the same 
darkness?</p><p>Rei exhaled a deep breath and her body was cold, but in the distance she 
could hear the crackling of fire.</p><p><i>What happened to me? I remember that I was 
chasing after Hotaru, but then... she suddenly disappeared from sight. Everything went 
black. The next thing I knew, there were these big, glowing eyes staring down at me. A 
monster! It was that thing that I saw in my dreams... And that flame, I never felt anything 
so powerful! I-I couldn’t move! </i></p><p>…<i>Was I shaking?</i></p><p><i>I was trembling, 
wasn’t I? Why am I trembling now?</i></p><p><i>Am I 
afraid?</i></p><p>“<i>REI!!!!!”</i></p><p>“Rei.” Her eyes snapped open. “Rei. Get up! This 
is no time to be lying around,” someone impatiently snapped.</p><p>The Martian weakly craned 
her head to get a better look at the irritated voice. Fierce aquamarine eyes met hers, and 
were threatening to burn a hole through her own if she didn’t promptly 
comply.</p><p><i>Great. I died and went to Hell and she’s still here.</i></p><p>“If you can 
move, then I would suggest standing up. I can sense that our foe is nearby.”</p><p>“You 
don’t have to tell me that!” Rei snapped as she moved to stand. Her legs were somewhat 
shaky, and she immediately noted a dull throbbing against her temples. It made concentrating 
that much more difficult in her somewhat weakened condition.</p><p>“Require any assistance?” 
Neptune’s ruler arched an eyebrow. Her offer was shot back with a glare of 
contempt.</p><p><i>Come on, Rei. Don’t lose your temper. She isn’t worth the energy! </i>Rei 
pulled an arm across her chest and stretched the stiff muscles. She then proceeded to loosen 
up the rest of her equally stiff limbs in a similar manner, all under the irritating 
watchful eye of her companion.</p><p><i><b>Twitch</b></i></p><p>“Do you have to stare?” She 
threw over her shoulder.</p><p>Rei knew that Michiru was normally a patient person, but if 
her tight lip and the glint in her eyes were any indication then the Goddess was losing that 
virtue very quickly.</p><p>“In case you haven’t noticed, Rei, we are the only two people 
here.”</p><p>“You were waiting for me? What a surprise,” Rei turned on her heel and faced 
the woman. “I was under the impression that you would ditch me if you ever had the chance! 
After all, you think that you’re so superior and mighty to everyone else just because you’re 
a Goddess! Why would you waste your time on someone who is only human?”</p><p>Michiru 
clenched and unclenched her fists, struggling to fight down the swell of aura threatening to 
break her control. She couldn’t believe how insolent this… this child was!</p><p>“We don’t 
have, time for this!” She stressed urgently. “Yes, I admit that I would have preferred to be 
with anyone else other than you. But unlike you, I, for one, am willing to put my personal 
feelings aside for what’s important.”</p><p>Rei was momentarily taken aback. All of the pent 
up anger that she had revelled in seconds before suddenly seemed so shallow. She opened her 
mouth—she wanted to say something back, anything, to lash out and repay this sickening 
feeling that the other woman had inspired within her. But no, at the last minute she bit the 
bullet and suppressed it.</p><p><i>As much as I hate to admit it, she’s right. Our first 
priority is to survive. If we can somehow get out of here and reunite with the others then 
we may stand a chance against Apollo.</i></p><p>“You said that we were the only ones here. 
Are you’re sure about that?” Rei asked again.</p><p>Michiru closed her eyes and drew in a 
long, deep breath. “Yes.”</p><p>“But… they aren’t dead, right? No, they can’t be. We’ll just 
have to believe that they’re all right! For now, we should concentrate on finding a way out 
of here!” The Martian swung her gaze around the void, but was met with a dead end no matter 
where she looked.</p><p><i>Geh.</i></p><p><i>It all looks the same! What’s going on...? Why 
are my senses going crazy? My head is buzzing! How in the name of Mars are we supposed to 
find a way out of here?</i></p><p>“This place…” Michiru narrowed her eyes, “...is nothing, 
yet is everything at once. Although it appears to be empty, I can feel our enemy’s presence 
throughout every inch of this space. Most likely, we are being watched as we 
speak.”</p><p>“Then what should we do? Other than blindly walking into an enemy trap, do you 
have any bright ideas?” She was irked by the woman’s smile. Behind all of those sparkles, 
there was a smug look and Rei knew it. “What with that look? If you have an idea then just 
spit it out already!”</p><p>“I do have one proposal…” She began.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“It is 
likely to fail.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rei crossed her arms in impatience. She disliked 
these guessing games.</p><p>“To put it in simple terms, it is because I am with 
you.”</p><p>“What?! Are you trying to pick a fight?”</p><p>“No. Not at all,” Michiru 
patiently reassured her. “All I am stating is the facts. Judging from our predicament, it 
appears that we have been thrown into a separate dimension. I imagine that it was likely 
created by Apollo.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“It means that he has a connection with this place,” 
she elaborated. “With a spirit as powerful as his, he would have undoubtedly left behind 
some kind of spiritual trail. If we could somehow exploit one of these trails and track his 
presence, then we may be able to escape from this place to where he is truly 
hiding.”</p><p>“So, you mean like teleportation in a sense. You want to turn his trap 
against him.”</p><p>“That is correct.”</p><p>“It’s not bad...but there’s one problem with 
it.”</p><p>“And that would be?”</p><p>“If your plan succeeds, then it’ll take us straight to 
him! Do you really think it’s a good idea to try and face him with just the two of us? What 
about the others?”</p><p>“There is no need to worry. They will be there.” There was a 
strange light in the Goddess’s eyes as she said this.</p><p>“You sound pretty confident 
about that. How do you even know that they’re still alive?”</p><p>“...I can feel it. Haruka 
is still alive, I can assure you that much. Can you not feel it?” Behind her, she saw the 
Martian turn her head. “As for the others, they are all accomplished individuals. I have 
faith in their abilities. They will find a way.”</p><p>“And me...?” She dared to 
ask.</p><p>“Well, that I can’t do anything about.”</p><p><i>Why you...!</i></p><p>Rei 
sighed. “Never mind, I won’t even bother. Anyway, back to this plan of yours...Let’s say 
that we find Apollo’s spiritual trail. What happens after that?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“I’m 
afraid I don’t quite follow. I thought you said we were supposed to 
teleport.”</p><p>“Hypothetically, yes. Speaking practically, then no, it will be 
impossible.”</p><p>“Then why did you--”</p><p>“What I am trying to say is...even if I am 
somehow able to locate a trail, it will be impossible to create the portal to follow it. We 
do not have the sufficient energy between us.”</p><p><i>So, it won’t work because we don’t 
have enough energy? </i></p><p>“When you say that it’s because of me that the plan would 
fail, is it because…”</p><p>“Yes. If it were any of the others, I am confident that it would 
succeed.”</p><p>Rei ignored the stabbing pain she felt in her heart. She was determined not 
to let this get her down.</p><p>“Why don’t we give it a try anyway?”</p><p>“What? You can’t 
be serious! Do you understand what you’re proposing? If we fail, then we will both deplete a 
good portion of our power reserves for nothing.”</p><p>“And standing around doing nothing is 
that much better? Just one time! That’s all I’m asking for.”</p><p>Michiru sighed and shook 
her head. She couldn’t believe she was going to do something so irrational.</p><p>“One 
time,” She emphasized. “Now, give me your hand. Concentrate on channelling your energy into 
mine. I will handle the rest.”</p><p>Rei felt the pull on her power as soon as she touched 
Michiru’s hand. The woman’s aquamarine eyes dimmed in concentration as she searched out for 
an appropriate target. Once she had found one that was satisfactory she began to fuse their 
two energies together; a pink-ish light enveloped them. Rei watched in amazement and winced 
when a single beam of their combined effort blasted out into the space ahead of them. She 
had almost expected something to happen, but it whooshed straight on through without 
colliding with anything.</p><p><i>I knew it. </i>“It’s not enough.” Michiru muttered 
tiredly. Rei felt her hopes sink; she had only half believed in Michiru’s words, but to hear 
that their attempt failed so miserably deeply bruised her pride.</p><p>“W-Well, if we can’t 
use that method…Then we should stay put.”</p><p>“Stay put? And ‘do nothing’?”</p><p>“Well, 
from what you told me…wandering around would be too dangerous. Our detection spells are 
useless in here... and chances are we’ll be ambushed if we go searching for an imaginary 
exit that may not exist. It’s better to be prepared and let them come to 
us.”</p><p>“...Point taken.”</p><p>Rei stepped a few meters away from her reluctant partner, 
and turned her back to her.</p><p>“I’ll watch this direction. You take my back.” When the 
Goddess did not move, she reluctantly added, “…Please.”</p><p>Michiru arched a delicate 
eyebrow, and complied with her comrade’s request. Soon the two fighters were facing back to 
back.</p><p>“That was usually courteous of you, but it was not necessary.” Michiru remarked. 
“This is, after all, the only plan left at our disposal. However…I must admit that it does 
pique my curiosity. I was under the impression that you didn’t trust me.” She 
mused.</p><p>“You talk too much.” Rei growled. “As you said, we’re the only two people here. 
Does it look like I have much of a choice?”</p><p><i>Don’t misunderstand me. I might not 
like you, but I trust your abilities.</i></p><p>“I see.”</p><p><u>(Michiru, a bit 
later)</u></p><p>With narrowed eyes the ruler of Neptune stared ahead into the monotonous 
darkness for signs of movement. They had been waiting for hours now, yet their perseverant 
resolve was rewarded by the increasing hostility of their environment; the atmosphere had 
grown to be so hot and dry that she thought they might as well be standing in the middle of 
one of Jupiter’s great deserts.</p><p><i>The enemy is no fool. </i>Michiru wiped away the 
beads of sweat forming upon her brow and rapidly blinked to help ease the itchiness of her 
eyes.<i> If we won’t move, then neither will they. They won’t have to. With the ability to 
warp the dimension to their specifications we are left with two alternatives: To stay and 
continually be weakened, or leave and risk ambush. In the latter they would go after the 
weaker of us. That would be…Rei. Though I doubt she is better off in our current 
predicament.</i></p><p>If a Goddess such as herself was suffering the dizzying effects to 
this degree then she could only imagine how the Martian was cooping. Curiosity soon got the 
better of her and Michiru peeked over her shoulder at her unexpected partner. Contrary to 
what she had thought, Rei was still standing tall with her head held high.</p><p><i>She’s 
still standing? </i>The woman was trying to hide her weakness, but Michiru saw right through 
it; Rei was trembling slightly due to a combination of exhaustion and mild dehydration. She 
was clearly struggling to keep her pride intact.</p><p>Michiru felt a stab of guilt to say 
the least. The person that she saw was not the childhood acquaintance she had befriended 
many years ago or the person she felt obligated to protect, but the murderer who took away 
the only family that she knew. Ares, the God of War; although they were not the same 
individual, the child behind her was his heir. She was his chosen successor. Deep down 
inside, watching her suffer in his place gave the Goddess a sickening sense of satisfaction; 
to watch her tremble as the beads of sweat matted her black tresses, to see that clear 
liquid of life leave her mortal body agonizingly slowly and fall to the ground in waste. It 
ignited a chilling flame within the depths of her soul. Michiru’s breathing 
hitched.</p><p><i>No. No! Don’t think about that! </i>She squeezed her eyes shut and tried 
to quell her rampant emotions. <i>I am Neptune Michiru, the ruler of Neptune. Above all 
else, I shall remain loyal to my people and fulfill this mission to the best of my 
capabilities. I must stand firm! I mustn’t allow my personal feelings to distract me, no 
matter how difficult it may be!</i></p><p>But when she glanced at Rei again, a lump had 
formed in her throat. Echoing screams and the fatal glint of a sword, splattered with blood, 
played itself before her mind’s eye. She dropped her gaze in shame and instantly regretted 
it; from out of nowhere, there was bloody river flowing against her feet. Michiru’s hand 
flew to her mouth to stifle a shocked cry.</p><p>“Ah--?!”</p><p><i>Blood? </i>Her heart 
pounded madly within her chest.<i> But where did that come from?!</i> The direction in which 
it was flowing from made her pulse race faster.</p><p>“Rei…?” Her voice fell to a 
whisper.</p><p>The armed figure behind her stood motionless, exhibiting no indication that 
she had heard the woman.</p><p><i>The blood…Why is it flowing out from under her 
feet?!</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i>No, that isn’t Rei. </i>She blinked and a 
tall, muscular figure with short dark hair stood in her place. He was wearing the Martian 
armor.</p><p>“Who are you?!” Michiru demanded. “And where is my companion? What did you do 
with her? Speak now or I will strike you down!”</p><p><i>I didn’t sense him at all! Rei. 
Where’s Rei?!</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Lubb 
Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p>…<i><b>shssss…</b></i></p><p>The armor 
creaked as the figure began to turn their head. Michiru froze when orange glowing eyes met 
her shocked ones.</p><p><i>No! It can’t 
be--</i></p><p><i><b>FwoooOoOoOsh!</b></i></p><p>“Auhh?!”</p><p>A blast of hot air blasted 
throughout the area, signalling the awakened presence. Michiru recoiled back and 
instinctively initiated an aura shield to ward off the effects.</p><p>“Michiru?! Michiru, 
what’s wrong?! MICHIRU!” Rei’s cries were drowned out over the roar of the 
wind.</p><p>Michiru could feel it now. His piercing gaze slipped through her mental 
barriers. It was plunging deep down inside her mind, into that infinite, dark well until he 
found what he sought. He found her. The Goddess was overcome by a nauseating sensation that 
threatened to buckle her knees as the voice of a child emerged. The child was screaming, 
demanding revenge with a vicious passion.</p><p><i>Suffer!</i></p><p><i>Suffer! Suffer! 
SUFFER!</i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>Does it hurt…?”</b></i></p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>All went 
white and silence ensued. Somewhere in the distance her consciousness began to awake once 
again.</p><p>...</p><p><i>...I remember.</i></p><p>…<i>I remember hearing their screams of 
panic...</i></p><p><i>Incoherent shouts and yells that intermingled with the disbelieving 
sobs. Their voices sounded jumbled to me, yet I knew why they cried. Why my people grieved. 
It was for the same reason that I suddenly found a gaping hole in my heart. That day, when 
my mother passed away…</i></p><p><u>(Palace courtyard)</u></p><p>Overlooking the courtyard 
there was a lone terrace, partially hidden from view in the palace’s shadow. A girl stood 
there; her shoulder length aquamarine hair waved fluently in the breeze, each silky curve 
cradling the mischievous entity before gently shooing it off to play. Her dress was 
seemingly perfect if not for the dried crimson stains that marred its back and her 
barefooted legs. It felt heavy—unlike the soft petals of the rose bouquet lying at the 
terrace entrance. A sympathy gift that had arrived early that morning, yet what was it to 
her? To lie there broken, its beauty fated to wither away until it crumbled into an 
unrecognizable mound of ash. She would have gladly lain there too, broken. Yet unlike the 
flowers, her beauty shall not fade. She would not die. For she was a 
Goddess…</p><p>Silently… Enviously…She unblinkingly gazed down into the courtyard below. She 
eyed her sobbing peers as they pressed against their guardians in both exhaustion and 
shock.</p><p>…<i>I remember the day that they all left…</i></p><p><i>Yesterday, they arrived 
as children. We were all children back then, blissfully living in ignorance, and shielded 
from the future duties that we were destined to perform one day. Yet today, this day… while 
they left as children, I was left behind. Even she, Haruka, had unknowingly left me as 
well.</i></p><p><i>The people cannot embrace security without a ruler. And without my 
mother, who else was there to fill that void, but I? The sole heir to Neptune’s throne? 
</i></p><p><i>Only a child… I shall no longer be one with tomorrow’s rising 
sun.</i></p><p>Something then piqued her interest. Mar’s heir; she stood a far distance away 
from the group as though she were abandoned, cut off from the rest of the world. Yet the 
girl regarded it all with indifference. She did not cry.</p><p>Feeling someone’s gaze, Rei 
turned her head to confront the intruder of her space.</p><p><i>Her 
eyes…</i></p><p><b>“…</b><i><b>No… Don’t think about that…”</b></i></p><p>Michiru allowed 
her gaze to linger a second longer, then retreated into the sanctuary of her 
chamber.</p><p><u>(Bedroom)</u></p><p>…<i>I remember the days that I spent within my 
room…</i></p><p><i>I rarely ate.</i></p><p><i>I could not sleep. Yes, it was that precious 
sleep that I pined for most dearly.</i></p><p>“Sleep, oh dear sweet slumber…How I’ve longed 
to be cradled in the soothing embrace of thy carefree rest. For one precious chance, my only 
hope is to preserve this sliver of myself before I lose all that I am. But if I am destined 
to slip, then allow me to drown within thee like the ocean waters of my 
home…”</p><p><i>While the maids and the palace staff periodically checked on me I pretended 
to be unaffected by Mother’s passing.</i></p><p><i>Sit up straight, keep your head high… 
Look the person directly in the eye as you speak to them.</i></p><p><i>Shush, only soft 
tones befitting for a lady. Allow a touch of a smile to grace one’s 
lips.</i></p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>… <i>'I 
understand'… I understood myself all too well…</i></p><p><i>With the creaking of the door, 
the signal of their dismissal, the world crumbled once 
again.</i></p><p><i><b>Knock-knock.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Knock. Knock. 
Knock.</b></i></p><p>“My Lady?” A woman’s voice inquired from the other side of the 
door.</p><p>Michiru inwardly sighed; the courtyard she had been staring so intently at these 
past few days was empty. A part of her acknowledged this, yet another did not. Phantom 
images of crying children reflected coldly on the surface of her deep, aquamarine 
eyes.</p><p>“My Lady--”</p><p>“Yes, I am here. You may enter.” The Goddess turned as the 
door opened and saw a young woman, perhaps in her late teens, standing in the doorway. She 
paused at this; there was something about the individual that she could not quite put her 
finger on. The girl was indeed tidy—she kept her long, chestnut hair tied back into an 
enviable long braid that ran all the way down her back. She was also tall and slim, and 
appeared to be a few years older than herself, but the girl’s dark-brown eyes regarded her, 
the ruler to be, this ‘child’, with a hint of fear.</p><p>Michiru, despite herself, felt a 
stab of guilt. Her eyes slightly lit up in recognition as she recognized the maid’s uniform. 
Perhaps this young girl was simply an unfamiliar face? Perhaps she had run into her in the 
past and had not taken particular notice of her features. The palace staff was comprised of 
a large body of individuals after all. Considering her duties, it wasn’t as though she had 
the time to spare to memorize every servant’s identity.</p><p>“I had specifically said that 
I shall not see anyone else today unless it was a matter of urgent importance.” Michiru said 
as she regarded her coolly. All around them the room temperature began to drop, and the 
servant visibly shuddered. “Speak now. For what reason have you disturbed me?”</p><p>The 
girl stuttered, momentarily at a loss of what to say.</p><p>“I--I was worried for your 
Majesty’s health.”</p><p>“Pardon me?” Michiru’s eyes flashed, her voice never betraying her 
quickly rising anger. “Is that why you have defied my wishes? Come now, it is no secret that 
a God or Goddess cannot become ill. It is a physical impossibility.”</p><p>“But that has 
nothing to do with your heart!”</p><p>There was a heavy silence. A million different 
responses flashed through the Goddess’s mind: Outrage, indignation, calm forgiveness… but in 
the end, she drew a blank. She was at a loss for words.</p><p>“My Lady, please, you haven’t 
left your room for days! You think we don’t know? That we don’t worry? You haven’t been 
eating lately... Your food almost always comes back untouched!”</p><p><i>Goddess’s don’t 
need to eat.</i></p><p>“You haven’t been resting either, have you? Every time someone comes 
in, you’re always staring out from that terrace!”</p><p><i>Goddess’s don’t need to 
sleep.</i></p><p>“Haven’t you already realized it yet? They’re already gone! Everyone left a 
long time ago!”</p><p>…<i>I should be getting angry. But why do I feel…</i></p><p>…<i>only 
pain…?</i></p><p>“What good does it do to keep yourself locked away?!”</p><p>“It 
doesn’t.”<i> It doesn’t do me any good.</i></p><p>“H-Huh?” The maid was startled that she 
hadn’t felt her Lady’s wraith. The young Goddess, instead, seemed to be preoccupied in 
thought.</p><p>“Perhaps I will take a walk. But where to…?” She hated to wander around 
without a destination in mind.</p><p>“If I may make a suggestion, how about the palace 
garden...?” Her servant suggested. “The gardener worked so hard on them this year… and the 
flowers are in full bloom as we speak. It would be a shame to not see them once more before 
the rains come. Please, perhaps it would cheer your Majesty up?”</p><p>“…Yes. Perhaps it 
will…” Michiru smiled. She hoped it would.</p><p>The girl stepped towards the door, watching 
the slightly taller woman scuttle out of her way, and then paused to meet her 
eyes.</p><p>“What is your name?”</p><p>“…Chisaki, My Lady.”</p><p>“I see. Would you care to 
join me?”</p><p><u>(Palace Gardens)</u></p><p>“It’s beautiful, isn’t it My Lady? Though the 
flowers aren’t as varied as they are in the Lunar gardens, they still take my breath away. 
Don’t you agree?”</p><p>“I suppose so.”</p><p>Michiru stepped up to the corridor railing and 
placed her hands onto the cool marble surface. They were nearly there-- the gardens were 
just a few scant meters below. Despite her attachment to the sorrow that plagued her 
endlessly these past few weeks, she could not help but feel her spirits rise a little at the 
sight; already she was drowning in the flowers’ scent, her senses revelling in their life. 
She was staring out at a sea of pure white flowers underneath a brilliant clear, blue 
sky.</p><p><u>(Rei)</u></p><p>“Michiru, what’s wrong?!” Rei hoarsely screamed at her. The 
frustration mounting on the Martian’s pale face began to betray the fear in her dark, 
amethyst eyes.</p><p><i>I don’t understand it! All of a sudden she just created an aura 
shield! W-What’s going on damn it?! Michiru isn’t the type of person to spook easily! 
Something wrong… But as long as her barrier is up, there’s nothing I can do to help her...! 
I have to somehow convince her to let it down!</i></p><p>“Michiru! Drop the barrier! There’s 
no reason to--” Rei felt herself stop mid-sentence as a wave of aquamarine aura rippled 
across the void. In an instant the barrier fell. “Michiru…”</p><p>Had she finally come to 
her senses? The Goddess’s outline soon became clear as the light fell away. Yet something 
was amiss; why hadn’t she suppressed her powers? The spiritual energy surrounding her was 
crackling with dangerous intensity.</p><p>“Hey, what was that just now?” Rei demanded. “Why 
did you suddenly do something like that? Do you want to give our position 
away?!”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Answer me!”</p><p>Michiru silently raised her hand up in Rei’s 
direction and startled the woman. Without a word of warning, she fired a bolt of energy and 
speared the Martian squarely in the chest. Rei opened her mouth in a wordless gasp as she 
felt her body fly 
back.</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p>“Gaa<i>AAHHHHH!!”</i></p><p><b>Thud!</b><i><b> 
Roll…</b></i></p><p>Pain. That familiar sensation greeted her once again. Rei bit her bottom 
lip and tasted a faint metallic taste there. Blood. In less than a second, over half of her 
wounds had re-opened. The smell was beginning to drive her instincts insane, but she didn’t 
dare to stop and administer her medicine. She was being attacked. She needed to defend 
herself.</p><p>Cursing herself for her carelessness, Rei managed to drag herself into a 
kneeled position. Her bloodied, right hand went for her sword but ended up hitting her 
side.</p><p>Rei gasped. <i>My sword! </i>Her eyes darted down to her side and then to the 
distant right where her weapon had fallen. The sound of crackling energy demanded her 
attention once again. She turned her head in time to see her ‘partner’ readying to discharge 
another gift in her direction. Rei narrowed her eyes. Her heart was racing wildly in her 
chest as those long, slender fingers twitched with malicious intent. It would be any second 
now-- she intently anticipated the deciding movement.</p><p>“Why?” Rei felt her throat 
constrict.<i> Her eyes aren’t clouded, so it’s not mind control? </i>“Why won’t you say 
anything?”</p><p><i>Was everything you said back there just a lie? But if that was true, 
then why didn’t you attack me as soon as I turned my back to you? Why aren’t you using your 
true power?! </i>Rei gritted her teeth as the light filled the void.<i> So help me… I will 
get an answer from you yet! Even if I have to beat it out of you 
myself!</i></p><p><i><b>CRACKLE--</b></i></p><p>“HAH!!” Her hand shot out and released a 
bolt of crimson 
lightning.</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE--</b></i></p><p><i><b>-------KABLAM!!</b></i></p><p><u>(Michiru)</u></p><p>A 
fresh, cool breeze broke across the gardens and showered the two women with a flurry of 
white petals. Silently, Michiru gracefully took a delicate blossom into her waiting, pale 
hand. As if a touch of a Goddess could make one blush, the petal bashfully deepened with a 
reddish-pink color.</p><p><i>Smooth… </i></p><p>…<i>soft, and… delicate…</i></p><p>A strange 
light flickered in her aquamarine eyes as she glimpsed the slivers of crimson refracting 
from its flawless, smooth surface.</p><p><i>If I should wish it… </i>Her long, slender 
fingers slightly curled about it.</p><p><i>Unlike with humans or ascended beings such as 
myself… if this fragile existence should come to an end by my hand, then it will simply be 
that. It will disappear without inquisition. Yet why would one care if a speck in the 
universe were no longer there? </i>The wind began to blow softly once again.<i> This gentle 
blossom… what purpose does it possess other than to grow to the specifications of its 
gardener? To remain rooted in the ground and merely exist to display its beauty to 
love-struck admirers? Now that it is free, it has lost that one, true purpose…</i></p><p>A 
shadow fell over the petal as an aquamarine light enveloped it.</p><p><i>Tell me… What do 
you have left now?</i></p><p>She waited, and intently listened to the wind. Amongst all of 
its whispers she searched to distinguish a voice, a plea… one, in her expectation, to be the 
quietest of them all. Yet as time flowed forward, she heard none. Would it not beg for its 
life?</p><p>The barest of smiles made its way to her lips.</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>As she turned 
her attention back to her company, her maid glimpsed the petal behind the Goddess. It 
danced; swirling and twirling with all it could muster until it finally disappeared into the 
magnificent background of blue sky.</p><p>“It’s strange…” Michiru mused. “To think that time 
would last forever and then, in a blink of an eye, you realize how fragile things truly 
are.”</p><p>“Are you referring to… the passing of Her Majesty, your mother?” The Goddess was 
silent. “That flower petal back there… You let it go. For a moment there it looked 
like—O-Oh! Please forgive me My Lady! I--I didn’t mean to insinuate…”</p><p>“No, please… go 
on. I would like to hear what you were about to say.”</p><p>The taller woman hesitated for a 
second, and then gulped at the insistence she heard in her Lady’s tone.</p><p>Under the 
Goddess’s watchful eye, she carefully continued, “I--I mean, I suppose what I meant to say 
is… why did you stop? You seemed to be in deep thought for the longest time… And then, when 
it looked as though you had made up your mind, you suddenly just changed! Did something else 
cross your mind?”</p><p>“Does it matter ‘why’ I chose to do what I did? Is it not true that 
my word is law?”</p><p>“W-What?” The servant gaped and was quickly turning red in the face. 
“Ah--yes! Of course it is! Please forgive me for my rudeness!”</p><p>Michiru narrowed her 
eyes as she continued to watch the girl’s embarrassed expression with a stern 
face.</p><p>“…You just apologized.” Her words made the other girl freeze. “Why… would you 
apologize for something that I had asked you to do? Was my request, to ask you to voice your 
opinion, wrong?”</p><p>The maid’s eyes widened in horror. “NO! That’s not what I meant!” She 
panicked. “What I meant--! What I meant was…”</p><p>“…That blossom… it had no 
voice.”</p><p>“I-I-I… I mean… whaaaaat?”</p><p>“You asked me why I spared it. It cannot beg 
for mercy like those who do possess a voice.”</p><p>“But, it’s just one blossom, isn’t it? 
There were many others. It was going to wither up and die soon anyway.”</p><p>“If that is to 
be its fate, then why not allow it to be so? Why end its journey sooner than 
necessary?”</p><p>“…Your Highness is merciful…” A shadow fell over the woman’s face. 
“However, those who are merciful may someday regret that kindness. Their enemies may take 
advantage of that weakness... extort it. In the end, it may very well be the very thing that 
destroys them. Her former Highness--”</p><p>“My Mother’s passing was indeed sudden.” Michiru 
cut her off. She approached the railing—tapping it gently, twice-- before once again turning 
her back to the woman. “It happened so suddenly, that even now I can scarcely believe it. Or 
why it happened.”</p><p>The wind began to shift.</p><p>“Why it happened?” She heard the maid 
question from behind her. “My Lady, whatever are you talking about? Everybody knows that it 
was Ares, the ruler of Mars who had committed the deed.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Michiru held 
her hands front of her chest and a ball of light erupted between them. Her guest squeaked in 
alarm and instinctively threw her arms up to cover her face. But past her arms, she could 
make out the materialization of a shimmering mirror between the Goddess’s 
hands.</p><p><i>You of all people should know the true reason…</i></p><p>“Submarine… 
REFLECTION!”</p><p><i><b>FwoooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOSH!!</b></i></p><p>Light shot out of the 
mirror and washed over the entire area. For an instant, she saw the scenery’s true 
reflection. The flowers wilted and crumbled to ash, melding in with the barren ground. The 
sky above darkened to a starless night, and her childish body reverted back to its true 
form. But more importantly, the maid was had stood before her was finally forced to revealed 
‘himself’.</p><p>“Apollo.” Michiru barely managed out the dirty name without letting her 
fury slip from her control. Her eyes were dangerously narrowed.</p><p>The silver haired man 
laughed in amusement as he eyed his own white-suit attire. “Even the hair and the eyes… that 
mirror is truly something,” he mused.</p><p>“You are a very arrogant man to try and trap me 
within an illusion, an illusion involving my past of all things. Did you truly believe that 
you could modify my memories without my notice? There never was a maid named 
Chisaki.”</p><p>Silver eyes glinted in approval. “Very good. Well done indeed! I must admit 
that I am impressed, Neptune Michiru. It is a pleasure to see that you resemble your mother 
not only in appearance, but in talent as well.”</p><p>“My Mother was a great ruler.” Michiru 
asserted, unfazed by his flattery.</p><p>“Indeed. The Lady of Neptune was a magnificent 
Goddess. She possessed a grace and intellect that was like none other within my court. But 
then she…” His voice dipped.</p><p>Michiru tensed as an intense wave of anger swept the 
area. <i>Such hatred…! </i>She secretly breathed a little easier when the sensation 
subsided.</p><p>“But never mind that.” Apollo smiled. “Please be at ease. I did not come 
here to fight you. In fact, I am here… to make a business proposition.”</p><p>“A business 
proposition?” She tightened her grip on her mirror when his silver eyes fell upon 
it.</p><p>“That mirror of yours…Yes, I know all about it. The Deep Aqua Mirror is said to 
possess the ability to reveal the ‘truth’ regardless of any illusion. A truly useful 
power... You see, I would like to ‘borrow’ it. There is a certain something that I would 
like to confirm. To see if a certain individual is really…deceased, if you know what I 
mean.”</p><p>Michiru’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“Oh, but I wouldn’t worry. This is a 
matter concerning an old friend of mine.” He gestured with open arms. “With that said, in 
exchange for your mirror, I am willing to make you an offer that you may be interested 
in.”</p><p>“...Such as?”</p><p>“The death of the Martian 
girl.”</p><p><i><b>DOOOOOOOOM</b></i></p><p><u>(Rei)</u></p><p>“HAA----AAH!!” Rei screamed 
as she unleashed another blast of power and watched it collide with the aquamarine 
bolt.</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE--</b></i></p><p><i><b>CRACKLE--</b></i></p><p><i><b>------KABLAM!!</b></i></p><p><u>(Michiru)</u></p><p>Apollo 
sensed an unspoken change within the Goddess, and was delighted by it. Even the calmest of 
personalities could not completely hide their deepest, darkest desires from him.</p><p>“It’s 
no secret that you want her dead. The sheer animosity between the two of you as you forced 
yourselves to watch one another’s back…was acting at its best! You may tell yourself that 
she is your comrade, and that you would do anything to protect her if it was within your 
power to do so… But both you and I know better. Deep inside, your true wish is to tear her 
to shreds with that very same power, isn’t that right, Lady Neptune? You want pay her back 
for all the pain she inflicted to you and your family. If you so desire, I can help you 
accomplish that.”</p><p>The temptation that flickered in her eyes encouraged the God to 
continue.<i> Just a little more, </i>he thought to himself.<i> As it is, I do have a strong 
hold over her body… But it seems that I had under-estimated her will. She is unconsciously 
refusing my commands to use her true power against the Martian brat.</i></p><p>“After all, 
what is one more casualty in war? People go missing unexpectedly all the time. Who would 
blame you for the disappearance of some human girl...? After all, she is only human… they’ll 
likely conclude that she died because of her own weakness. Really, when you think about it, 
humans who willingly fight in a Battle of the Gods are foolish. Don’t you agree?” He paused. 
“They think they can do whatever they want. When things are going well, they forsake 
you...but when things go wrong, suddenly, they have a change of heart. They only cling onto 
you and drag you down... like right now. You could have left by now if it weren’t for her, 
isn’t that right? Not to mention, she is not an ordinary human. She is a Martian, and the 
heir to the one who murdered your mother.”</p><p>This time, Michiru did not 
protest.</p><p>“As part of my proposal, if you wish to be charitable, you will have the 
option of being merciful and giving her a quick, precious warrior’s death. That is what 
those Martians value the most, is it not? War…bloodlust… <i>murder.</i> Between you and me, 
that little friend of yours is no different. There is a secret that she is keeping from all 
of you, a very dangerous one at that. I see that you doubt me, but I can assure you that it 
is the truth. She is a blood-thirsty animal that is just waiting for the ample opportunity 
to strike. So I ask this of you... will you continue to allow such a monstrosity to roam 
free? For all you know, the wind ruler may be her next victim.”</p><p>Michiru saw flashing 
images of her dying mother and the savage hunger in the War God’s eyes as he committed the 
foul deed. Her grip on her mirror tightened.</p><p>“...How?” She finally asked.</p><p>“Hm? 
How, you ask? It’s rather simple, really. In exchange for some of your powers, I will give 
you some of mine. Does that sound like a fair exchange to you?”</p><p>“How do I know I can 
trust you?”</p><p>The Sun God met her gaze straight on. “Oh, you will…”</p><p>…<i>Because 
this is too good of an opportunity for you to pass 
up!</i></p><p><u>(Rei)</u></p><p><i><b>CrAcKLE!</b></i></p><p>“AUUugGHHH!!”</p><p><b>THUD!</b></p><p>Rei 
hit the ground head-first, and was all too aware of splatter of blood beginning to soak into 
her sweat-drenched bangs. The two intermingling, putrid scents automatically prompted the 
woman to twitch her sore nose in disgust as she rose from the ground and back onto her feet. 
Her breaths were already coming in and out with pained rasps; she was lucky that Michiru’s 
initial strike hadn’t pierced anything important, but it still had done damage; it had badly 
startled her. She was torn inside as she continued to battle against Goddess and her own 
instincts.</p><p><i>This isn’t good! </i>Rei planted her feet into the ground in an attempt 
to focus despite the dizzying effects of the fall. It wasn’t going as she had planned. 
Michiru was still going strong, but she was becoming weaker as the fight 
progressed.</p><p><i>C’mon! …Geh--!! Get a hold of yourself! She’s coming!</i></p><p>Rei 
unconsciously gulped as Michiru motioned to raise her hand once again. It didn’t take a 
genius like Ami to know that another direct attack could very well kill her. But as the 
energy began to materialize in the woman’s hand, to Rei’s great surprise, the Goddess’s hand 
abruptly fell limp by her side.</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>“Rei…”</p><p>“Michiru!” Rei rasped 
out. But her brief respite quickly gave way to shock once she sighted the dark energy 
pulsing in Michiru’s aquamarine eyes. They were darker, yet strangely clearer than they were 
a moment ago. She froze.</p><p>“Michiru, what do you think you’re doing?! Have you lost your 
senses? We’re supposed to be fighting Apollo together, not against each other!”</p><p><i>If 
I can talk to her, then just maybe--</i></p><p>“Don’t you see? This is exactly what he 
wants! Don’t go playing into his hands!”</p><p>She paused, and stumbled back as the 
dimension around them began to warp. The black surface that they stood upon became a rigid, 
rocky surface, while the darkness above transformed into a cloudy sky. A fresh breeze 
whipped by and sent strands of her dark hair whipping behind her.</p><p><i>Now 
what?!</i></p><p>“Be quiet.” Michiru 
commanded.</p><p><i><b>Shing</b></i></p><p><b>BAM!</b></p><p>“AHHH?!” Rei gagged as an 
enormous force hit her from all sides and immobilized her to the spot. Through heavy eyelids 
she watched as her sword fell to the ground like a block of lead, leaving her vulnerable. It 
hurt; the sickening feeling of helplessness was threatening to drown her senses. She 
couldn’t move; her arms were plastered to her sides, and it was taking every ounce of her 
strength just to stand.</p><p>“What am I doing?” Michiru’s mocking tone drifted across the 
plain. “Nothing...other than to bear witness to your death.”</p><p><i>No! ...Michiru!</i> 
Rei shut her eyes tight in disbelief. “You can’t be serious Michiru! You can’t be! You—you 
aren’t thinking straight!”</p><p>The Goddess smiled. It was an empty smile without any 
warmth at all, but a touch of pity.</p><p>She didn’t need to say anything. At once, Rei knew 
that it wasn’t simple mind control. Michiru, the individual standing before her now, was 
painfully aware of what she was doing.</p><p>She wanted her dead.</p><p>“Why you…” Rei’s 
body quivered with emotion. The past, this present, and the bleak future that suddenly 
loomed before her—everything—it all pained her. “All of the sacrifices that were made just 
for us to get here! Did none of that matter to you?!” <i>How many more lives are going to be 
lost while I’m standing here doing nothing? </i>“Do you really feel nothing for them? What 
about your own people? Are you really going to abandon them...because they’re 
human...?!”</p><p>Rei drew deep within herself and searched for the remnants of her power. 
At the end of the darkness there were a few threads left. Seizing onto them, she ripped the 
energy from the field around her and forcefully pulled it into herself.</p><p>“Are you 
really that heartless, Michiru?!”</p><p>The smile, long gone from the Goddess’s face, was 
replaced by a frown as the crackling energy surrounding her former comrade continued to 
expand.</p><p><i>She’s using the barrier’s energy to replenish her own. </i>She calmly 
realized.</p><p>“I would worry about yourself, Rei.” Michiru flatly advised. “You’re 
becoming emotional. That’s not like you.”</p><p>“Emotional?! Is that what you think? I…No, 
WE trusted you!” It was not the answer she had been waiting to hear.</p><p>“Is that so?” 
Michiru walked right up to her captive. They were standing at an arms-length apart now. She 
began to raise her hand. “I must admit, it’s quite amusing to hear that coming from 
you.”</p><p>Rei flinched and shut her eyes tight when the woman’s hand shot forward, but 
when she opened her eyes again there was no noticeable pain. The Martian blinked back as she 
watched the Goddess calmly walking away. Why hadn’t she killed her? When she saw what was in 
Michiru’s hands, she suddenly knew why.</p><p>“Don’t touch that! Give it back!” she 
demanded.</p><p>Michiru turned the gun in her hands with a critical eye. “So...it was true. 
He wasn’t lying after all.”</p><p>“What? Who?! You aren’t talking about Apollo are 
you?”</p><p>“That is none of your concern.” She squeezed the gun in her grip and her power 
danced threateningly around it. Rei instantly went silent. “What does is...you lied to us. 
You were keeping a secret from all of us, one that endangered our very lives. 
Myself...Haruka...Minako’s...you didn’t just have to kill my family, but you were willing to 
put my friend’s lives at risk as well? How low have you fallen...you scum.”</p><p>The word 
brought Rei to flinch. It wasn’t what she had intended, but she knew that Michiru was right; 
she had put lives at risk due to her selfishness. However, the words somehow came out of her 
mouth regardless.</p><p>“...I didn’t mean...”</p><p>“As Haruka would say... ‘Stuff it’. I 
have no intention of listening to any more of your excuses. I have... other things in mind 
for you.”</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>Rei gasped as Ami’s gun was blasted into bits. 
Michiru let the remains fall to the ground, appearing to be quite satisfied by the other 
woman’s expression.</p><p><i>...No. </i>“Do you even realize what you’ve done?!”</p><p>“I 
do.” She was met again by a surprised look. “However, I believe the occasion called for it. 
You deserve to be destroyed.”</p><p>Rei was shaking so hard now. Her power was beginning to 
slip out of her control. “...So, that’s it, is it? You’re going to join up with that 
murderer just to kill me, is that right? What are you going to tell the others? Or...are you 
just going to pretend that it never happened?”</p><p>“I suppose that depends.”</p><p>“And 
you really trust him? He’s just using you! As soon as I’m dead, what guarantee do you have 
that he won’t kill you too?”</p><p><i>How well do you know me?</i></p><p>She was surprised 
when Michiru smirked at this. The Goddess lifted her hand, this time with the intent to 
finish the job. Their gazes locked.</p><p><i>You’re such a fool.</i></p><p>“Grr… 
TRAAITORRRRRR!”</p><p><i><b>C-R-A-C-K-L-E!</b></i></p><p><i><b>BLAMblamBLAMblamBLAMblamBLAM!!</b></i></p><p>In 
a single, electric explosion, the area within a twenty meter radius about the Martian was 
instantly vaporized. Michiru’s attack had been knocked far off course.</p><p>Michiru 
remained unfazed as the dust clouds settled. Rei was now free of her constraints, but at a 
price; the raven-haired warrior appeared to be a little short of breath.</p><p>“Out of 
breath already, are we?”</p><p>“S-Shut it.” Rei growled. Her amethyst eyes glinted 
dangerously.</p><p>“Hm.” Michiru smiled. “How much longer will that bravado last, I 
wonder?”</p><p>Without giving the Martian a chance to speak again, the Goddess of Neptune 
closed her eyes and began to concentrate deeply. Rei sensed it first, an invisible wave 
rippling throughout the area that shook the very stability of the space around them. Her 
stomach lurched as the gravity shifted.</p><p><i>This feeling!</i></p><p>“It can’t be!” She 
gaped in disbelief.</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>No sooner had the words left her lips 
a single explosion lit the sky above them. The entire sky took on a reddish, orange hue, 
igniting with seemingly endless energy. Rei felt a chill run down her spine as she watched 
the small flames streak across the sky in soundless horror. Memories of her visit on Venus 
and the fiery sky of that day blurred with the present.</p><p><i>Ahh…haaa…</i></p><p>Her 
breathing hitched as the ground began to 
roar.</p><p><b>Rmm!!!…Rmmm….Rmmm…Rmmm!!!!!!!</b></p><p><i><b>Sheeeennnn--</b></i></p><p>“Rrg!” 
Rei leapt back when a blinding light erupted between the two women. At Michiru’s feet, a 
swirling portal of dark energy opened. Both combatants felt the pull towards it instantly; a 
massive presence was about to emerge.</p><p><i>No! It--It can’t be! </i>Rei’s heart hammered 
wildly within her chest. She gulped as a pair of slitted, red eyes glowered at her through 
from the portal entrance. And as if it was able to smell the delicious aroma of fear, a 
joyous laugh boomed with another release of energy. Snakes of blue fire bellowed with the 
resounding battle cry, and hungrily lunged forth and encompassed the Martian girl within a 
rectangular ring. Amidst the choking fumes and merciless heat, Rei quickly found herself 
isolated from the Goddess of Neptune.</p><p>“Are you ready Rei?” She heard Michiru’s voice 
drift through the fire.</p><p>A shiver ran down her spine as heavy, armored footsteps 
punctuated the silence. On instinct Rei fumbled for her sword, grabbing it and hastily 
raising it into a defensive position as a dense spiritual presence neared. Every fiber in 
her muscles tensed as she braced herself for the worst. Her adversary, a blazing spirit, 
emerged from the wall of blue flame with Hell’s escorts. Bit by bit, the flames dismissed 
themselves to reveal their mighty Lord-- the right side of the fiery shield extinguished-- a 
long, trailing glint of metal reflected in dark amethyst eyes. Then the mid-section, where 
the proud symbol of Mars lay engraved within the red armor; the nauseous churning in Rei’s 
stomach was elevated by the sadistic smile of the black-haired warrior who challenged her 
now.</p><p><i>I-It’s you…</i></p><p><i><b>FWOOOOSH!</b></i></p><p>“Ares!”</p><p>Beyond the 
fire, Michiru wordlessly watched the reunion between student and mentor with cool 
indifference.</p><p>“<i>To prove that I am true to my word, I will fulfill my end of the 
bargain first. Kill the Martian girl in whichever way that pleases you. Then, once you have 
found it to your satisfaction, I will come for the mirror.”</i></p><p>“That is correct Rei. 
He is the God of War…” Michiru lifted her hand. There was a brief moment where the 
determination in her eyes flickered with uneasiness, but it was quickly swallowed by the 
flick of her hand.</p><p>“ARES!” She commanded.</p><p>The air about the God of War grew 
dense, and was becoming increasingly distorted. A light humming filled the air as invisible 
shackles crackled and evaporated. Ares stretched his head to the side in one rigid movement, 
as if his entire body was stiff due to lack of use. Rei gulped, and heard the heartbeat 
filling her ears. The God took a slow step forward and then another. Leaning down into his 
left shoulder lightly, with one smooth movement the ground exploded. <b>Crack! </b>The tip 
of his blade cleaved the ground, engraving a jagged crescent emblem into it—the unspoken 
promise that its next target would reap greater rewards.</p><p>Dry particles tapped Rei in 
the face, but still she could not move. The hungry obsession burning in the man’s orange 
eyes hypnotized her.</p><p>Ares paused in his step, and drew back into another striking 
pose. A taunting silence hung in the air when the God unleashed a wild burst of energy into 
the atmosphere.</p><p><i>What?! Where did he go?!</i></p><p>The God watched his opponent 
stagger back in confusion. Without hesitation he lunged forward, cutting through the wind 
and lashed out with a horizontal strike.</p><p><b>Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! 
</b></p><p>“HWOOOOOO!”</p><p>“…?!” Mid-heart beat, with the roaring wind in her face and his 
anxious cry hanging in her ears, she felt a chill run down her spine. A thin, horizontal 
shadow raked across her 
mid-section.</p><p><i><b>FWOOOssssssh—</b></i></p><p><i>No!</i></p><p><b>TING!!</b></p><p>“Ugh!” 
Rei clumsily shoved her sword to the side and made a pathetic attempt at a block. But it 
wasn’t enough; she clenched onto her weapon for dear life even as she was toppled over. 
<b>WHOMP! </b>An armored-bound foot sunk into her cheek and drilled her face into the 
unyielding rock.</p><p><b>THUD!</b></p><p><i>Damn it!</i></p><p>The foot tauntingly 
continued to beat against her head. She could hear his mocking laughter.</p><p><i>Damn it! 
Damn it! Damn it!</i></p><p><b>Bam! 
…Bam!</b></p><p><i>Why?!</i></p><p>…<i>Why…?</i></p><p><i>I was positive that I would find 
him if I hunted after Apollo. Find him… Kill him... Find him. Kill him. It was all I could 
ever think about ever since he disappeared. I told myself over and over that when I find him 
I’d kill him without a second thought. So… why am I hesitating now?</i></p><p><i>How in the 
name of Mars did Michiru ever get this power? </i>Unknown to her, Michiru was no longer 
smiling.</p><p>Rei let out an involuntary wheeze when Ares abruptly stopped his beatings and 
dragged her up to his face. He held her about the collar with a powerful fist, ignoring her 
wheezing for breath, and proceeded to inspect his catch as one would do with goods. Male or 
female, Rei knew it was irrelevant to the man; he judged his opponents through other 
means.</p><p>“D-Damn you…”</p><p>She unconsciously gulped, and trembled as anxiety spiked 
though her. She knew what he saw. Trash-- a worthless hunk of meat that only served the 
meaningless purpose of taking up space. Less than how he viewed her before…</p><p><i>Stop 
looking at me like that! </i>Rei gritted her teeth. In the back of her mind, she was 
fighting the urge to unleash that other side of her.</p><p>Ares reached down to try and pry 
the sword from her clenched fist, but paused when a light pressure on his arm attracted his 
attention.</p><p><i>Who do you think you are?! </i>Rei gripped down harder on his forearm, 
adding electric punch into it. The God’s grin widened as his armor began to melt under her 
touch.<i> I don’t need your approval!</i></p><p><i><b>Crackle…CrACkle…</b></i></p><p>Her 
amethyst eyes flashed.<i><b>CRAckLe! </b></i>“You… HAVE NO RIGHT TO JUDGE ME!” She 
roared.</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE—BOOM!</b></i></p><p>The War God was forced to release her as the 
energy blast pummelled into his chest. Given this opportunity, Rei thrust her blade forward 
and discarded his breastplate with a clamor.</p><p><i>There! </i>She pushed 
again.</p><p><i><b>TING!</b></i>A small curse left her lips as her path was blocked. This 
time the mild approval flickering in the God’s eyes infuriated her.</p><p>“…!” She heaved 
her sword, “HAAAAAAH--!!”, and threw him back. The God slid to a stop a distance 
away.</p><p>“Both of you…” She eyed Michiru and then Ares, “…disgust me! I had no idea how 
alike you two were!” She paused to catch breath. “But you, Michiru! At this moment, you’re 
worse than he is. You won’t even fight your own battles! Only a coward would sit back and 
watch!”</p><p>“Do you believe that your opinion matters to me?” The Goddess coolly stared 
back. “As far as I’m concerned your words are meaningless.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“This noble 
front that you’re trying to portray…That in itself is laughable. There is no such thing as a 
noble Martian. I have heard enough of your people to know them for what they truly are-- 
blood-thirsty, instinct driven animals! Still don’t believe me...? Why, look at your proud 
leader over there.”</p><p>Rei was bewildered. “You really think that you know everything 
just because you’ve ‘heard’ about it? That was the past!”</p><p>“Regardless. Enough of this 
meaningless chatter... You may call me whatever you wish, Rei, but in the end what good is 
your noble charade if you are dead?</p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p>“…Wouldn’t you 
agree?”</p><p><i>Only the strong survive… Hmph. That’s not surprising to hear that from you. 
</i>“I’ll show you who’s dead! After I’m done with him, you’re next!”</p><p>Michiru flicked 
her wrist, and Ares rushed forward once again. This time Rei was ready for him. As the God 
leapt up and fell towards her with his sword cocked, she threw her weight into her right 
shoulder and 
swung.</p><p>“RAAAAAAAAAAH!!”</p><p>“HAAAAAAH!!”</p><p><i><b>TZING--ssssSSSSsssssSSSSSss!!</b></i></p><p><i>I’ll 
show you!</i></p><p>Their blades met in a resounding clash of metal, prompting a deadlock 
while their crimson auras spat at one another furiously!</p><p>“And you!” Rei glared as she 
was met with orange eyes. “Allowing yourself to be controlled by Apollo… for a proclaimed 
God of War, you’re… pretty weak! PATHETIC!” She grunted and shoved him back.</p><p>Ares took 
the force in stride and smoothly stepped back, only to be assaulted by lightning quick 
strikes.</p><p>“Here I 
come!!”</p><p><b>Tzing!Tzing!Ting!Ting!</b><i><b>Fwoosh!</b></i><b>Crash!</b><i><b>TIIIING!!</b></i></p><p>“Is 
this all you have?” Michiru whispered from the sidelines. Behind her cool facade, there was 
genuine worry. Her hands were effectively tied; it was all up to Rei now. And if she didn’t 
pull a trick up her sleeve soon then they both may succumb to this 
trial.</p><p><i><b>Jingle</b></i></p><p>The Goddess remained unfazed as a long, slender 
shadow materialized from behind her.</p><p><i><b>TING! TING! TING—WHOMP!</b></i></p><p>Rei 
narrowly dodged Ares sword, allowing the heavy blade to impale the ground instead. In the 
split second his guard was down she thrust an electrically charged hand into his 
face.</p><p><i><b>Crackle- </b></i><b>bam!</b></p><p>“RaaaAAAAH!!” Ares let out an 
animalistic roar and gripped at his watering eyes with insurmountable fury. But before Rei 
could sink her blade through his exposed chest, the man hurriedly retreated out of her 
range; her blade bit thin air.</p><p>“You--!!” She growled. “What’s the matter? Turning 
coward because you got poked in the eyes?”<i> Damn! …I almost had him!</i></p><p>But her 
frustration couldn’t match the God of War’s. He shuddered violently as drops of blood were 
excreted from his bloodshot eyes and dripped down his face and cheeks. There was enough that 
the ground was soon defiled with his blood.</p><p>Rei’s heart skipped a beat. <i>No...T-This 
feeling! </i>The blood-lust in her was beginning to awaken despite her best attempts to keep 
it at bay.</p><p>The God wiped the nuisance from his cheek, smudging it as he did so, and 
stared at the sticky fluid drying on his palm. His eyes lit up with 
inspiration.</p><p>“What?!” Rei startled when Ares impaled his own hand with his sword! She 
then scowled, “You… bastard!”</p><p>The God chuckled with amusement. Ignoring the pain and 
swelling he wretched the blade from the injured flesh, and allowed the blood to spill. This 
action even prompted Michiru’s questioning.</p><p>“Blood magic,” Rei breathlessly uttered. 
<i>So, you’re really going to use it after all!</i></p><p>The man pressed his wound against 
his blade and dragged it agonizingly slow across the surface. The smeared trail of crimson 
blood began to ignite with an eerie golden glow.</p><p>“Michiru, did you ever wonder why we 
Martians valued blood so much? So much that some even lusted for it? Not even once when 
you’ve heard the stories, you’ve never questioned why we were the only humans to act this 
way?”</p><p>Michiru was silent.</p><p>“I’m not denying that our soldiers weren’t as good as 
animals. But that was in the past. Before the Great War with Apollo our people were weaker 
than the average humans. We might have developed the strong mentality that was necessary to 
survive in the harsh climate of Mars, but without proper nutrition and constant training, 
there was only so much that could be done.”</p><p>“So, your leader was too proud to ask 
Apollo’s Court for aid?” She took the woman’s silence as an affirmation. “If your people 
were truly that weak, then why the sudden transformation in the War? The Martians were 
respected as the greatest of warriors amongst the Planetary Alliance.”</p><p>“…In 
preparation for the Battle of the Gods, Ares revived an ancient technique that is said to 
exponentially increase one’s power. He had perfected it himself.” Rei felt the beads of 
sweat on her brow multiply with the increasing temperature. There wasn’t much time 
left.</p><p>“It’s only requirement was…blood. It draws on its life energy. The more blood 
there is to draw from, the greater power one could obtain. However the effects are only 
temporary, and to use it safely the user needed a strong will. Because of the continual 
fighting during the Great War, many Martians eventually succumbed to its power lust. It’s 
dangerously addictive, almost like a drug! Soldiers infected by it would go to any length to 
have its power again, even after the War ended. To prevent this in the new era, the secret 
was restricted to the Martian ruler…while those who had gone insane were executed on the 
spot. Many people died… That. Was our sacrifice for peace!”</p><p>A contemplative look fell 
over the ruler of Neptune’s eyes.</p><p>“So don’t go about talking like you know everything 
there is to know about us. Some truths are kept out of history for a reason! Blood magic is… 
a God’s technique. And it’s killing me...”</p><p>“What...?”</p><p>“This secret... I know I 
don’t deserve to be forgiven. I know that I’ve put your lives at risk! But even if I had 
told you about it, there’s no cure! Except...”</p><p>“...You said that it preyed on life 
energy.”</p><p>“Because I don’t take others, it takes mine.”</p><p>“But if you had an 
infinite lifespan...”</p><p>Rei fell silent. Michiru calmly regarded the woman for a minute, 
but she hadn’t forgotten her mission in the slightest.</p><p>“If it is as powerful as you 
claim it to be, then what will you do?”</p><p>Ares whipped his sword around and took on a 
striking stance. Rei narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“I’ll fight.” <i>I have to stop him before 
it’s too late!</i> “Take… THIS!” She yelled.</p><p><i><b>CrACKLE! </b></i></p><p>As the 
crimson lightning charged forward, Ares unexpectedly dove into it and cut it down with his 
sword. In desperation Rei discharged several more, only to feel her confidence slipping with 
each deflection.</p><p><i><b>Crackle! </b></i><b>Ting!</b></p><p><i><b>CrAcKle! 
</b></i><b>TING!</b></p><p><i><b>CRACKLE! FWooooooOSH!</b></i></p><p>Her last attack 
ricocheted back and tore through her left shoulder, severing the clasp that held her chest 
plate and shoulder armor together.</p><p>“Ah…AHHHHHH!!”</p><p>Orange eyes gleamed in delight 
to see the blood spilt by the wound. But he didn’t have an infinite amount of time to admire 
it. The foe that he had only injured rashly ripped off the dangling piece of armor and 
lunged forward, making wild swings in his general direction. One stab to his right, down at 
his leg and then directly into his blade, he caught them all with impeccable precision. A 
thought, a fluttering desire to mock the poor fighting style flickered in his mind but it 
had slipped away.</p><p>At first the God only needed the tip of his blade to block the 
feeble attempts of an assault, but with passing time his opponent was quickly honing their 
strikes. His grin widened; there was enjoyment in this.</p><p>Ares parried a close call and 
unleashed an aura barrier. The circular shield expanded rapidly, forcing his unwilling 
opponent away.</p><p>“No!” A hint of panic entered Rei’s voice as she summoned her own 
barrier to counteract the effects. The two shields collided, leaving only a five-meter 
breathing room radius around the woman.</p><p>“Rrrrg-----AHHHH!!!!” <i>Wait. What’s he 
doing?</i></p><p>The God of War then sunk his blade into the ground, cracking the rock, and 
lifted his arms towards the fiery sky. His fluctuating energy skyrocketed towards the 
Heavens and rounded down into itself, combusting into the form of a flaming sphere. 
Helplessly, his heir watched it accumulate in size. Growing bigger and bigger, heating the 
air… Once it became so hot that Rei thought she was going to suffocate, the sphere began to 
pulse. The sound of twined heartbeats echoed throughout the chamber.</p><p><i>His most 
fearsome attack... I’ve never seen it myself, but… </i>Rei panted. Fragmented memories of 
carnage following the previous actions he had performed awoken to her mind.</p><p>The God 
gave a mighty leap and landed atop of the spherical entity.</p><p><i>I have to stop it. I 
have to stop him! </i>Her senses screamed in her mind.<i> But how?! His power has more than 
doubled since we last exchanged blows! </i>She gripped her injured shoulder in 
frustration.<i> If I only had Michiru’s help! No, even then it wouldn’t be enough. And if I 
attempted that technique, there’s still no guarantee…</i></p><p>…<i>Is… Is this it? I can’t 
beat him?</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i><b>-- Lubb 
Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i><b>-- Lubb 
Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i><b>- Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p>The 
pulsing was gaining momentum.</p><p><i>No…</i></p><p><i>There’s no choice! </i>“I-- I have 
to give it a try!”</p><p><u>(Michiru)</u></p><p>“What do you plan to do, 
Rei…”</p><p><i><b>Jingle</b></i></p><p>There was the swish of a long braid, and then the 
shadow was gone.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p><u>(Rei)</u></p><p>Ares smirked as his greatest art was 
nearing completion. It would be any moment now he would finally claim another 
victory.</p><p>“Heh… Don’t think you’ll be smirking for much longer.” Rei mumbled. Despite 
her trembling, she drew upon the last of her power reserves and fuelled her 
barrier.</p><p><i><b>Fwoooooooosh!!</b></i></p><p>“Do you really hear nothing Ares?” She 
cried over the wind. “Are you really ignorant of what you’ve done, or of the people you’ve 
hurt?! Why do you let Apollo control you?! I know you aren’t weak enough to be 
controlled!”</p><p><i>Although I resented you...There was no stronger fighter that I had 
looked up to…</i></p><p>“…” The God of War stared blankly at the woman he had deemed his 
heir.</p><p>“Ares!”</p><p>The wind picked up speed and drowned the rest of her words; above 
the two fighters, the ball of energy was beginning to crack. Rei knew it was a matter of 
seconds before ‘they’ would be released.</p><p>She raised her sword up in front of her with 
both hands, and closed her eyes. Everything around her dimmed: The sound of the howling 
wind, the ache of her body due to her wounds and dehydration, her fear, and the pain of 
betrayal. She became numb to all of these things. The cold sensation chilling her senses now 
originated from a greater loss. In this one moment, she could only think,</p><p><i>I’m sorry 
Mina… If there was only another way! If I was only a little stronger...No... But, then 
again, I’ve always said that. I’ve always been making up excuses, haven’t I? 
</i></p><p>‘<i>This should be enough’... ‘Maybe I’ll wait a little longer and see what 
happens’... You said that you liked me because I was an honest person. But... to be honest, 
I’m not. I’ve been running away this entire time, even up to the point of our departure. 
</i></p><p><i>But after this, I won’t anymore. I’m going to win this fight, even if it means 
beating him and her! ...Because... there’s still something that I have to tell 
you.</i></p><p><i>...I...</i></p><p>“…love 
you.”</p><p><i><b>Stab--SHPLOOOSH!!</b></i></p><p>“!” Michiru gasped.</p><p>With a grunt, 
Rei twisted the metal blade buried in her midsection. Once, twice, her insides churned with 
blinding, searing pain. <b>Rip!</b> She withdrew the weapon and released her life with it. 
It drained down her front and back, it soaked her hands, legs and clothes.</p><p>Feeling 
weak, Rei reflexively pressed a shaky hand to the gaping hole in her front.</p><p>“This… 
should be enough! It just—has to be!” <i>So, what do you say? All or 
nothing...?</i></p><p>Summoned by her will, the droplets on her armor lit up with a golden 
hue. Her blade, the one she had recently re-acquired, was held tightly within her grasp and 
also began to resonate with similar power. With a single sweep of her swords-arm, the spilt 
blood along the ground shot out and threaded together in the form of a 
net.</p><p>Simultaneously, Ares also readied his arsenal above. The energy ball in the sky 
exploded and two fiery wolves materialized. They howled their battle cry, shaking their 
fiery manes with bold confidence. Rei unblinkingly stared up at the two beings; the animals 
bared their fangs, the saliva dripping between their jaws was unable to express the 
uncontrollable desire engraved within their orange eyes. Still, they patiently held for the 
command from their master-- her former mentor.</p><p>Briefly their eyes 
met.</p><p><i><b>TWEEEEEEEET!</b></i></p><p>“AROOOOOOOOWL!!”</p><p>Without hesitation Rei 
leapt into action. With a silent command she doubled the strength of her barrier, pushing it 
forward until it met Ares’s in equal strength. The winds collided and intermingled into one 
chaotic whirlwind. The wolves howled in confusion as their movements were significantly 
slowed.</p><p>The smirk on Ares face faded slightly; the golden light emitted from the maze 
of blood below was gaining in intensity. Perhaps it was because her senses were unusually 
heightened but Rei could have sworn that she had felt something stir in the God. But what 
did it matter to her now?</p><p>“AROOOOOOOOWL!!”</p><p><i>This is it! </i>She drew in a deep 
breath. <i>This is the end for 
you!</i></p><p><i><b>Sheeen…</b></i></p><p><i><b>FwooooooOOOOOOOOSSSSH!!</b></i></p><p>The 
net of blood below sprung to life, scaling upwards towards the two hounds. Both dogs whipped 
around wildly, desperately trying to avoid the golden thread. But it was in vain. In a blink 
of an eye the net overcame them, trapping them within a suffocating grasp. Not even the 
flames that comprised their being could melt their captive 
bonds.</p><p><i><b>Shnk.</b></i></p><p>“HaaAAH!”</p><p><i><b>SLASH! 
SLASH!</b></i></p><p>“AROOOOOOOOOOOOO!!”</p><p><b>Shroom! Shroom!</b></p><p>Both hounds 
instantly disintegrated with the sweep of Rei’s blade. But she couldn’t stop there. Using 
the momentum of their de-materialization she propelled herself higher and higher up to her 
true goal.</p><p>“ARES!” She drew back her glowing blade. The God of War didn’t hesitate to 
brandish his own before catapulting himself towards her.</p><p><i>I’m going to kill 
you!</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i>I’m going to kill you!</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb 
Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i>I will… end this!</i></p><p><i><b>LUBB 
DUBB!</b></i></p><p>“HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!”</p><p><b>TING.</b><i><b> SLAAAA--SH!! 
KABOOoooOOooOOooOOOOOOOOM!!!</b></i></p><p>The greatest explosion yet ripped through the 
area with full force. Michiru braced herself against the shearing wind, scarcely believing 
what she had just witnessed.</p><p><i>A human versus a God…</i></p><p>A different light 
emerged in the sky above. The fiery hue that swirled over the center of the battlefield was 
drowned in a pool of aquamarine light. The Heavens were no longer devoid of emotion or 
burning with anger, but were quelled into a breathless calm.</p><p>Michiru recognized the 
presence instantly.</p><p><i>Mother…</i></p><p>The Goddess soon felt the rain, and was glad 
for it. Her breathing hitched uncontrollably as she caught sight of her friend. Rei lay 
motionless against the crumbled rock, her drenched bangs folded over closed eyes. The blood 
from her fatal wound had yet to cease.</p><p><i>Is she…?No... I-I didn't think it would go 
this far!</i></p><p>“Rei!” Michiru called to her.</p><p>“Girl.” A deep voice echoed. Michiru 
startled when the God of War came into view. The man past her and stopped in front of his 
heir’s limp body, never moving to kneel or to touch her. His dark eyes were no longer in a 
trance. They shone with recognition and pride.</p><p>“You’ve done well, girl... Just as I’ve 
expected.” He eyed the gaping wound along his right side. “But don’t disappoint me now. I 
didn’t spend all those years raising you to have you die on me.”</p><p>Ares craned his neck 
up towards the sky, allowing the water to spill over his being. After listening for a 
moment, he silently thanked the entity that had granted him this brief moment of free 
will.</p><p>“This isn’t over yet!” He declared with a roar. With that there was a brilliant 
flash of light; crimson flames wrapped about the Martian heir and gently lifted her from the 
ground into a cocoon of warmth. Rei stirred lightly as golden threads flew across wounds, 
cleansing them with unbelievable ease.</p><p><i>It feels so warm… </i>She peered out from 
under heavy-lidded eyes. Although she couldn’t see what was happening around her, she could 
feel the pain melting away.</p><p><i>What is this…?</i></p><p>“Ares…?” She spotted him and 
nearly had a heart attack.<i> You aren’t dead?!</i></p><p>“It can’t be…” Michiru whispered. 
She felt her own powers were resonating with the flames.</p><p><b>“</b><i><b>Don’t lose 
focus!”</b></i>A voice in the rain advised.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Rei tried to move but 
found her that her movements were restricted.</p><p>“You still have a job to fulfill.” Ares 
reminded her. “Don’t lose sight of that.”</p><p>“What do you--? Ah! Fire?! Where am I?” She 
gasped. “It’s… Aaaahhhh...getting so hot--!!”</p><p>Her pulse accelerated as the energy 
around her fused into her own. Soon her entire body was brimming with power.</p><p><i>What’s 
happening to me?! </i>She could feel his eyes on her.</p><p><b>“</b><i><b>I, Mars 
Ares…”</b></i><i> His voice boomed. </i><i><b>“…hereby relinquish both my throne and title. 
Use it wisely… Mars, Rei… GODDESS OF 
WAR!”</b></i></p><p><i><b>FWOOooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!!</b></i></p><p>The flames flew up into the 
sky, evaporating all of the rain with their re-kindled might. And at the center of it all, 
Rei’s presence dominated the plain; behind the fire, her steely determination resounded 
powerfully in her eyes and materialized the flames to greater heights.</p><p><i>She’s truly 
a force to be reckoned with, </i>the former God of War mused, greatly pleased. However, with 
the last drop of rain gone he felt the call resonate deep within 
him.</p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>“Gah--!” Ares’s hands flew to his head.</p><p>“What?” Rei 
reeled her power in and the wall of flames diminished.<i> I feel so strange! Better than 
I’ve ever felt before! But, how is this even possible? I thought...When he taught me that 
technique, he didn’t want me to be his heir.</i></p><p>“Rei!” Michiru rushed to her 
side.</p><p>“Michiru! You--!”</p><p>“There’s no time for that! HE’LL be here any 
minute!”</p><p>“Huh? Who? You can’t mean--”<i> Apollo?! </i>"But weren't you working with 
him? I don't understand!"</p><p>“You both… should have enough power now.” Ares uttered to 
Michiru. “However, it would be useless without a guide! Agh!” The pain inside his head was 
growing. The call was gaining strength.</p><p><i>My mother must have told him. But 
nevertheless, he’s right. </i>“Locating a trail that would take us to Apollo would take a 
considerable amount of time. I haven’t the faintest idea of where to start looking! The new 
fabrication of this dimension has destroyed any previous paths.” Michiru analyzed 
aloud.</p><p>“Then use me!” Ares proposed.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“I still have a 
connection with Apollo. If you destroy my body, you can track his presence back to him!” His 
struggles for mental domination escalated to greater heights. “Gah—AHHhH!”</p><p>“Wait a 
second!” Rei interrupted in confusion. “You mean this entire thing... You, and Him… this was 
a set up?!”</p><p>Michiru was silent for a moment. “…There was much that was taken into 
consideration. I found an opportunity while conversing with the Sun God. I thought that I 
might be able to undo the mind control he had over Ares if we were in close proximity, but I 
quickly realized that I could not. It was too strong, and at that point I could not stop 
what had been set into motion. If I had come to your aid even once during the battle, Apollo 
would have instantly regained control over Ares. However, once you were able to weaken him 
enough…”</p><p>“Forget about that! What about now?!”</p><p>“He’ll be taken over again.” 
Michiru eyed the dry ground where puddles had resided moments earlier.</p><p>“Destroy me!” 
Ares demanded.</p><p>Rei was forced to step away from the God as his flailing grew wild. She 
hesitated, but a gentle hand on her shoulder brought her to look into firm aquamarine 
eyes.</p><p>“There is nothing that we can do for him. Apollo has controlled his mind for so 
long that his presence has left a permanent imprint. He will continue to summon Ares until 
he submits.”</p><p>“Indeed.” An unimpressed voice dryly agreed.</p><p>“Apollo!” Rei and 
Michiru shouted at once.</p><p>…<i>Apollo! </i>Michiru stood tall and unyielding to his 
intimidating gaze.</p><p>“Now what do we have here? A Goddess, a traitor, <i>and</i> a human 
who has ascended to the rank of God? I do not recall this as part of our agreement.” The Sun 
God eyed the trio with sour dislike. “You’re a traitor, just like your Mother!” He 
spat.</p><p><i>A human ascended to a God? </i>Rei stared at the Sun God in disbelief.<i> Is 
he talking about me? But that would mean--! That I--!</i></p><p>“My mother was the tactician 
that led to your eventual downfall. What less did you expect from her daughter?” Michiru 
looked him in the eye.</p><p>“…!” The man clenched his hands into fists by his sides. “Well, 
she isn’t around to protect you this time! Ares!”</p><p>“NO—ARRGH!!” An orange hue started 
to surround his body until a lightning bolt assaulted the Sun God.</p><p>“What?!” Apollo’s 
concentration was broken as the aquamarine lightning-bolt warped and wrapped about him. 
“Impossible! You still dare to defy me, even after death?! What a nuisance!”</p><p>“Do it 
now! Before it’s too late!” Ares commanded them.</p><p>“Rei!” Michiru grabbed a hold of the 
other woman’s hand. Reluctantly Rei felt her newfound power begin to surge and intermingle 
with Michiru’s as before.</p><p><i>No. No, no, no! Things are going too fast! I’m a 
Goddess?! Ares, what?! </i>Amethyst eyes watched as the fused powers rise like a fiery 
spirit and descend upon the fallen God.</p><p><i>This isn’t fair! </i>She wanted to scream 
at him.<i> I still haven’t beaten you yet! You think you can just go off and die and make 
everything better like that?!</i></p><p>She couldn’t suppress the hot tears that fell freely 
now. “ARES!”</p><p><i><b>ROOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRR!! KABLAAAAAAM!</b></i></p><p>The man’s body 
disintegrated within the explosion and consequently warped the small space where he once 
stood. Rei and Michiru lunged towards the newly created portal, with Michiru tightly 
gripping onto her comrade’s white-knuckled hand.</p><p><i>Rei… </i>Her own heart ached at 
her friend’s loss.</p><p>“…” Rei clung onto Michiru’s hand so tightly that she was numbly 
aware of their approach to the portal. It was a spiral of orange light, the last gift her 
mentor left behind.</p><p>As the two women passed through it, the new Goddess of War heard 
his voice echo distantly,</p><p><b>“</b><b>Lead them well…”</b></p><p>…<i>All right... I can 
promise you that much. I won’t fail!</i></p><p><i><b>FwoooOOOOOOOOSH!</b></i></p><p>“DAMN 
IT!” Apollo cried in outrage. In a fury he grasped the accursed energy about his waist and 
broke it with a twitch of his hand. “Two more got away!”</p><p>Without hesitation the Sun 
God retreated. Even as his presence vanished from the area, remnant dust particles of the 
explosion continued to shower the area. Black eyes watched the breathless sight in distant 
wonder.</p><p>“Beautiful, isn’t it?” A woman quietly inquired from behind. The former 
Goddess of Neptune patiently measured the God’s reaction expectantly.</p><p>“Neptune.” Ares 
turned to face her. He peered down at his hands, finding them transparent like the rest of 
his being. “Neptune, I… I’m…”</p><p>“It’s all right… I understand.” She shushed him, and 
reassuringly touched his cheek.</p><p>The God’s face visibly relaxed. “It’s not over yet, is 
it?”</p><p>“No…” She eyed him sadly. “But soon... The children have grown 
strong.”</p><p>Ares hesitated, considering this for a moment. He then eyed his blade, still 
sunken in the brittle rock.</p><p>“Yes, they have… And it is every God’s wish to one day see 
their student surpass them.” He touched the blade and watched as it broke and crumbled back 
into 
ash.</p><p><i><b>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhsssssssssssssss….</b></i></p><p><i>Soon…</i></p><p>…<i>We 
await the day when we will no longer need to fight…</i></p><p><b><hr></b></p><p><b>Next up 
in HFD, Ch. 39: Against the Sun: Setsuna</b></p><p><b>Apollo appeared fairly anxious to get 
his hands on Michiru’s mirror...but what was it that he wanted to check up on so badly? In
