<h1>Spice with a Pint of Life (part 15 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>A/N: I wrote the song names in English instead of their Japanese names. 
Same goes for the lyrics. There are also short lines in the chapter that 
will show a change between the singing and the scene changes (some 
places there are more than one scene change in a row). You&#39;ll see what I 
mean.

Finally, if you have the songs Mina and Rei are going to sing, you might 
want to listen to them while you read this chapter. It might make the 
reading more enjoyable (Scratch that, it WILL).

(I don&#39;t think Mina actually sings this one song but please bear with 
me.)

Minako&#39;s POV, stadium

&quot;Uhh, sorry for the wait folks. We had some technical difficulties but 
the final round will begin underway! Come on! Let&#39;s hear something if 
you haven&#39;t fallen asleep! Give it up for Hino and Aino san!&quot; The 
announcer boomed.

The crowd sprung back to life and cheered at the top of their lungs as 
the lights came back on.

CLICK- Clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk!

&quot;Listen to me! It didn&#39;t matter which life it was. I was happy not 
because of some memory... but because you were there with me.&quot;

Rei... My hands tightened around the microphone in my hands. I quickly 
glanced over to her figure but Rei didn&#39;t notice. She seemed to be in 
deep concentration about something.

Is she still nervous? Or maybe she feels embarrassed about what she said 
earlier...? Saying that sort of stuff does make her uncomfortable after 
all...

&quot;YAAAAH! That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about! Now, who of these two best 
friends come out on top? Aino san will be starting this round 
with---Oh?&quot;

I had raised one of my hands up into the air.

With my eyes closed I was picturing the lyrics for my next song.

For this competition, I had originally planned a different song in mind 
for my last piece...but now, there&#39;s another one that would be more 
appropriate, simply because this isn&#39;t about being part of a duo 
anymore. This is about what I&#39;m feeling.

&quot;Is something wrong Aino san?&quot;

I waved my raised hand and spoke into the microphone. &quot;I would like to 
change the song please.&quot; A wave of hushed whispers washed over the 
place. Out of my peripheral vision I could see my words had snapped Rei 
out of her concentration. She was now blinking back at me in confusion 
to my request. Silently answering the confused woman, I smiled and gave 
her a small wave with my free hand, watching her immediately twitch. By 
the rowdiness and noise our audience was making it appeared that many 
assumed the gesture and friendliness was a taunt; we were still 
&#39;opponents&#39; after all. And apparently by the way Rei was twitching she 
was having similar thoughts. Inwardly I had to sigh. Silly 
Rei...Unfortunately, everyone couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. &quot;For 
my last number I would like to sing, &#39;Say you love me&#39;.&quot; (Suki to Itte)

There was a pause before the announcer came back on confirming the 
change. &quot;Whenever you&#39;re ready Aino san, take it away!&quot;

Around me the lights dimmed and then the familiar upbeat music came on.

It was something I just had to write... something I just had to say...

&quot;What head is confused

when it remembers your smile?

I saw you in my dreams, but you&#39;re not my type...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minako&#39;s apartment

Rei responded by rolling in my grip and snuggled up tight against me, 
her head on top of my shoulder by my face. I lifted my head up slightly 
and pulled her closer till her head rested in the crook of my neck 
before I allowed my head to rest onto hers. Almost immediately I heard 
her breathing slow to a steady rhythm. A sigh of relief escaped my lips.

It didn&#39;t matter if I got sick... if it meant Rei would get better that 
was all that mattered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Your magic eye speeds up my heartbeat

If I don&#39;t do anything, I can stay near you
The clouds, the road, and the mind leave singing...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Early Morning, Archery Grounds

&quot;Ohayo Rei chan!&quot;

She stood there with her back facing me, not moving.

&quot;Ah, you know Rei chan, that shot wasn&#39;t very good, nope! It was waaaay 
off!&quot; I lifted a hand similar to a salute position and turned my head 
side to side in a mock search. &quot;It landed...way behind the target ne?&quot;

&quot;Mina chan...&quot; She growled back.

I didn&#39;t notice it before but the senshi of fire was shaking slightly. 
Maybe she&#39;s cold? Kind of odd since she is wearing her miko outfit...but 
perhaps she&#39;s sensitive to the early morning chills?

&quot;Aww, maybe Rei chan needs a hug.&quot; I whispered to myself, stifling a 
giggle with my hands.

The raven-haired goddess whipped around just as I flung myself towards 
her.

&quot;Mina y-.&#39; Her eyes widened, shocking paralyzing her body movement.

Whomp.

&quot;Ahaha, thought you could use a hug Rei chan.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Say you love me, say I&#39;m dear

Little by little I gently grow used to you

I love your heart,

Straight out, I believe you want to visit no matter when.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dream, Hikawa Shrine

I want you so bad...

To feel the warmth of your body pressed to my own as we share a heated 
kiss, two lovers caught up in a silent passion...until we were forced to 
separate for air. Cursed air, yet we both need it as much as we needed 
each other. That&#39;s what I wanted to believe in. I want to believe in 
you, in us.

Your hands trailing up my sides, stroking my skin gently, blessing it 
with a tingling sensation that made me feel alive.

I want to share my life with you.

My heart sped up hearing you soft gasps and groans as I returned the 
favor, bringing a smile to my lips. If only this could be our forever. 
It could be, if you would accept it and me. I know I would if you gave 
me the chance. Because...

I love you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Our first date was a Sci-Fi Movie

Next, my head was about to flood

Whatever this girl&#39;s feeling is

surely, nothing beats it

I want to take a drive and kiss
Even with a little headache, I like to remember&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the movie

&quot;Don&#39;t laugh but it feels like there are blanks in my memories.&quot;

&quot;Wh-at?&quot;

&quot;See? It&#39;s stupid, I shouldn&#39;t have told you.&quot; Rei picked up her speed. 
It had taken me an extra second to realize that she was making fast 
tracks.

I made a few quick steps of my own and caught her by the shoulder, 
prompting her to stop but not enough to force her to turn around.

&quot;No, it&#39;s not stupid. I believe you. It&#39;s just...it surprised me, that&#39;s 
all. What did you mean by blanks?&quot;

Her shoulders relaxed a bit. &quot;That&#39;s what I mean. When I think back, 
there are times where I have no clue where I was or what I was doing. I 
can remember what I was doing before and after in various spots but I 
can&#39;t remember what happened between the two. I didn&#39;t think it was 
weird at first...but when I gave it more thought, I realized that it 
wasn&#39;t in just one or two places...it was more than that, it was a lot. 
I tried asking the sacred fire but it wouldn&#39;t tell me anything. I get 
nothing...Who knows, maybe I&#39;m losing my touch...&quot; Rei turned partially 
around. &quot;I bet you think...

&quot;Do I think what?&quot;

&quot;...that I&#39;m weird now...&quot; her voice trailed off.

I surprised her with a hug and laughed. &quot;Is that what&#39;s bothering you? 
Silly, you couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth! I love you and still do.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Say you love me, say I&#39;m dear

Little by little, I easily get used to you

When we quarrelled and passed each other

I will suffer exactly that, if you want to visit&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apartment, shortly after marketplace visit

&quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot; Rei tried to brush away my hand.

&quot;Don&#39;t you say it&#39;s nothing,&quot; I shot back. &quot;Because of me you 
almost...again...If...you disappeared...&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m here...Isn&#39;t that what I&#39;m supposed to be here for? To protect 
you, our leader?&quot;

&quot;Is it nothing more than that! How can you see so much yet be so blind!&quot;

&quot;Mina chan...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Say you love me, say I&#39;m dear

Little by little, I easily get used to you

When we quarrelled and passed each other
I will suffer exactly that, if you want to visit&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------


I want...you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I love your heart,

Straight out, I believe you want to visit no matter when...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Listen to me! It didn&#39;t matter which life it was. I was happy not 
because of some memory... but because you were there with me.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last words left my mouth and the music faded away. Fans were 
cheering louder than ever before.

&quot;Spectacular! So much emotion, I could almost cry! Wait, too late... 
E-Excuse me for a minute.&quot; There was a sobbing noise coming from the 
mikes, followed by a sound of someone blowing their noise. &quot;Ahh...Sorry, 
the song was just that good. It really moved me to tears. Waaaaah, 
before I start up again let&#39;s turn our attention to Hino san. I wonder 
if the fire temptress will be able to top that!&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV


&quot;...&quot; Ahh...

She changed the song...because of...?

I felt myself smirk. Well, don&#39;t count me out yet Mina chan! Like Mina 
did earlier, I also raised my hand.

&quot;WHAT? Wow, look at this everyone! If this is what I think it is...is it 
Hino san?&quot; Our host wondered aloud.

&quot;Yes. I would also like to make a song change as well.&quot;

Again the sound of muttering overtook the stadium. A few random comments 
reached my ears.

&quot;Did you hear that? Another song change!&quot;

&quot;Wow! But do you think it can outdo Aino Minako?&quot;

&quot;I think so.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s like...her secret weapon?&quot;

I quickly glanced over to where Mina was standing. For a brief moment 
our eyes connected. She should know this song...

&quot;I would like to sing, &quot;&#39;Eternal Melody&#39;.&quot; (Eien no Melody)

There was a shuffling sound as with Mina&#39;s turn before I heard the &#39;go 
ahead&#39;. &quot;All right,whenever you are ready Hino san.&quot;

I took in a deep breath and then brought the microphone up to my lips 
for my last song of the evening. Yet unlike many other times, I didn&#39;t 
try to clear my mind from all my thoughts. Instead, as soon as the first 
words left my mouth, I embraced the memories that came flooding back.

&quot;Shaded by the sunlight

In my heart you are here

Even without saying you love me
You are here in my heart&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vision during a illness


&quot;Mina...chan...it hurts.&quot;

Somewhere inside my heart cried out for her, but she wasn&#39;t here, I was 
alone. Silence followed my voice.

Without warning I felt a pair of invisible arms wrapped themselves 
around me. The aura was familiar. It was Mina&#39;s. I couldn&#39;t see her, but 
she was here...she was here. Domo arigato Kami! I tried not to cry when 
I felt those comforting arms or when the warmth of her body pressed 
itself against my side. I really tried.

I rolled in the presence&#39;s grip, pushing myself against Mina&#39;s warmth. 
The weight on my chest lifted and I could breath again. I don&#39;t know how 
long we were like that but it felt like an eternity.

To my disappointment I felt the arms leave after the eternity. A fear 
rushed me, what if I was going to be left here alone again?

&quot;Mina!&quot; I cried out.

&#39;Open your eyes.&#39;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Say, thanks for your bravery

Look, the newly born power

Covering everything, shining brightly

Even more than the spacious sky and the sea

My dreams have no limits

I have realized that because I am in love&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you want to remember who you were? And imagine the power you 
would regain! You can go back to playing hero again. Besides, it&#39;s what 
this dumb blonde wanted to get back for you, even though she knows it 
would cost her an eternity of torture.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if I lose my memories... and even... if I lose my powers forever... 
I&#39;ll still do it for Mina-chan! Do you hear me! I mentally shouted to 
Mars, hoping she would hear my heart.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FLAAAAAAAASH!

&quot;In the name of Mars, I shall punish you! Mars...Flame...SNIPER!&quot;

CRACKLE!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;In the stream of destiny

I want to swim together with you

Whatever happens to us

I&#39;ll be sure not to give up&quot;


------------------------------------------------------------------------

...But what if they were sad memories? What if they were hard 
struggles...?

I&#39;d still want to remember. Even if they were sad and especially if they 
were full of struggles. What would life be without struggling? Too easy 
if you ask me, you can&#39;t get anything for free... it sounds almost 
superficial, to never have suffered.

...What if it brought more struggles?

I&#39;d still want to know. If there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing then I&#39;ll look 
for it, no matter what it takes. Good or bad.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;...Mina-chan, I remember everything...&quot;


------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Say, I&#39;m glad we met each other

That warm atmosphere around us

The days of being hurt are melting away

I love you so much that I could die

Drifting in the wind the seed

Will sprout like your smiling face&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hikawa Shrine

&quot;Did the shower help?&quot;

The blonde dropped right beside me and gave me this really sarcastic 
&#39;are you kidding look&#39;.

&quot;I...guess that&#39;s a no?&quot;

Whap!

A pillow slapped me in the face!

&quot;Mina!&quot; I roared after the recovery.

&quot;Hai Rei chan?&quot;

WHAP!

&quot;Hey, no fair I didn&#39;t hit you that hard!&quot;

&quot;All&#39;s fair in love AND war!&quot;

Mina glared back, her eyes mere slits of ice. I wonder what she plans on 
doing now?

&quot;That so?&quot; She sweetly whispered.

That was definitely not what I was expecting. In fact, I expected her to 
throw the pillow this time. Instead she threw herself!

Wha!

Bump, thud!

No fair! No fair! Where was the warning shrill? &quot;That wasn&#39;t fa-mmpf!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outside the television store

&quot;Come on, it&#39;ll be fun! Don&#39;t worry so much. As Haruka said in the 
newspaper, they&#39;re all cheering for us.&quot; Mina ran up a bit and spun 
around, tipping her shades down as she did so. &quot;Right?&quot;

&quot;...Hm...&quot;

&quot;So are we set for the park still?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Uh, hello? H-hey!&quot;

&quot;Keep the shades on! Do you want to be found out?&quot;

&quot;...Meanie.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the swimming Pool

&quot;Hm? What&#39;s wrong? You can swim can you? If you can&#39;t I can run over and 
get you a cute little lifejacket.&quot;

&quot;I can swim! It&#39;s just...&quot;

&quot;...Rei...You may be a master of fire but you&#39;re still human. You won&#39;t 
burn out. Now IN!&quot;

Shove

SPLAAASH!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Where there is no sound in the corners of space

Everybody is alone

When at least our feelings of love meet

I can go on to tomorrow&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Let&#39;s do our best okay?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The throbbing building up warmly

Eternally whoever&#39;s heart it is in

It will resound loudly, the magical melody

Even more than the blue sky and the sea

I will chase after my dreams with love
Your deep eyes told me to do that...&quot;

As soon as the last word left my mouth I paused to listen to the silence 
that had filled the room.

&quot;Wow... I-I...just wow...&quot; The announcer stuttered. &quot;W-well, if everyone 
will now... hey, where are you going Hino san?&quot;

Feeling all eyes on me I walked across the stage to where Mina was 
standing. There was something I had to do...

When I finally reached the blonde I noticed there were tears in her 
eyes. This time, I knew it wasn&#39;t a hallucination. I also noticed the 
whispering had died down to a deadly silence.

Ignoring the awkwardness, I put my microphone on the ground and then 
took her hands into mine and gulped, readying myself for what I was 
about to say. Even with Mar&#39;s soul back, speaking in public really made 
me nervous.

&quot;M-Mina chan...&quot; I felt my hands shaking. My eyes wanted to stare at the 
ground but I forced myself to keep eye contact with Mina. More than 
anything I wanted to run...almost...but there was something I wanted 
even more.

I told myself I wouldn&#39;t run away again.

Isn&#39;t that right Mars?

Not much of a talker but I could feel that she agreed with me.

Taking a deep breath, I said loudly, &quot;Mina, I love you! If you would 
stay with me...&quot; As expected, a loud chain reaction of gasps echoed 
throughout the stadium. But who cares what they think? With one hand I 
cupped her face and slowly leaned in. If Mina was afraid of her career 
then she can push me away now. She could always say that the love was 
one sided to the press and go on being famous solo. That would be fine, 
I wouldn&#39;t take it personally.

...Because... I&#39;m willing to put everything that I am on the line for 
this love. When I think about it, why should I care what other people 
think? What is there to be embarrassed of anyway? There&#39;s nothing wrong 
with it.

This feeling inside my chest has grown so much through all this time... 
so much that I feel like it could explode any moment.

I blinked to see Mina had caught on and to my surprise she also leaned 
forward. My eyes closed as both of our lips met in a sweet, gentle kiss. 
Before I knew it, there were tears falling down my own face.

Then the unexpected happened, there was a loud clapping that soon 
followed. It started small with two people and then gained momentum as 
it spread out and around the stadium.

Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! 
Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!

When we broke apart from our kiss Mina breathlessly replied, &quot;Of course 
I will! B-But I thought you were...with public attention...&quot;

For once, instead of making a frown I grinned and shot her back her 
classic &#39;V&#39; for victory pose. &quot;What&#39;s with that face? I&#39;m not 
embarrassed about our love.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Mina began to giggle. &quot;Then I guess that means I can...&quot;

Kiss

&quot;Okay, okay, enough of that,&quot; I crossed my arms with a renewed frown as 
Mina began to giggle once more. Another thought then crept into my head. 
&quot;You know...with this show...&quot;

&quot;I get ya,&quot; Mina winked and raised her microphone to her mouth. As she 
did that I picked up my own and ran across to the other end of the stage 
and positioned myself. &quot;Sorry everyone, but the competition is 
officially over! We, the performers, call it a draw!&quot; The audience 
chuckled at that, including the announcer overhead. &quot;And to thank you 
all for all your support, both Rei and myself will perform one extra 
song tonight. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll bring back memories for us all. So please, 
sit back and enjoy yourselves!&quot;

The new music came on.

&quot;Can you find the real me?

Somewhere here, dreaming somewhere, hurting everywhere

For a far off memory...&quot;
