<h1>Don't Look Back (part 2 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dontlook-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>*now arriving in Tokyo, please keep seats in upright position with 
tables up for landing*

Michiru jumped slightly as the electronic voice announced their 
arrival. Taking a quick scan of the cabin she was in, it looked as if 
there were only a few passengers left to get off.

&#145;I&#146;m here&#133;I&#146;m safe&#133;&#146; she thought with a small smile, the first she&#146;d 
smiled since the friendly man beside her had gotten off on one of the 
intervals. She&#146;d forgotten which one.

&#145;Dad used to be like him&#133;&#146; the aqua haired girl thought sadly, 
gripping the arm rests of the chair as the plane descended quickly, 
causing her ears to pop painfully, despite the gum she was chewing.

*All passengers please leave the aircraft, I repeat, this is the last 
stop, Tokyo, 3:45 hours, Tokyo time. All passengers off*

Michiru smiled softly as she stood, picking up her light suitcase 
before exiting the plane. A few people exited before her, most being 
greeted by sleepy looking friends and family. She frowned, wondering 
if her father had noticed her absence. She&#146;d left a note in her 
dresser drawer by their picture, telling him not to worry, that 16 was 
old enough to take care of ones self.

&#145;sorry daddy&#133;but you wouldn&#146;t listen&#133;&#146;

Brushing the tears from her eyes, she shouldered her way past the 
small groups of families, exiting the massive airport before anyone 
could really take notice of her. She didn&#146;t need anyone identifying 
her. There weren&#146;t many 16-year-olds around with bright aquamarine 
hair.

A row of taxies were waiting at the bottom of the stairs, causing her 
to trot down the marble steps toward the last open taxi.

&#147;Wait! Wait please!&#148; she cried, a feeling of foreboding rushing 
through her system as the offending taxi pulled away from the curb, 
speeding away. The others followed, each carrying a cargo of sleepy, 
yet excited people to their destinations.

&#147;No&#133;this can&#146;t be happening&#133;&#148; she whispered, sitting heavily on the 
cold marble steps. She sat for a long time, looking up only when a 
light hand touched her shoulder.

&#147;hello miss, may I give you a ride?&#148; a husky voice asked, causing her 
to jerk her head up to stare at the man. He extended his hand as she 
gave him a wary look before accepting it slowly.

&#147;the name&#146;s Derek.(AN: ^_^ not yet ppl) and yours?&#148; Derek asked, 
watching the wariness slowly slip from her gaze as she realized this 
would be her only way to get to a motel for the night.

&#147;Michi-Michelle. My name is Michelle&#148; She whispered, standing from the 
cold steps toward his car, parked some ways away. She felt an 
uneasiness somewhere inside her, the same feeling she often felt when 
she knew her stepmother was coming home before her father was.

&#147;you know, I think I&#146;ve changed my mind abou-&#148; she let out a yelp as 
she turned at the bottom of the steps, seeing the dark haired man so 
close behind her. Before she could do more, his hand shot out, 
wrapping around her mouth with a harsh force. Her suitcase clattered 
to the ground as Michiru struggled like a hellcat to get away from the 
man.

&#147;shut up you little slut, or I swear I&#146;ll kill you.&#148; The man grated as 
Michiru tried to remember the name he&#146;d told her. She felt fear swell 
in her soul as he drew a long blade across her throat, shoving her 
forward, into a darkened ally between the airport and a large art 
gallery&#133;

Haruka sped along the inner streets of Tokyo, glad for the light 
traffic after her strained meeting with a new magazine. It had ended 
later then expected, and had ended on the remark that she would need 
to find a new girl for the beach edition.

&#145;at least I won&#146;t have to deal with Sarah anymore&#133;&#146; she thought with a 
slight smile, enjoying the feel of wind blowing through her hair. She 
slowed for a red light, glancing around to see where she was. Teal 
eyes widened slightly as she saw a expensive looking suit case lying 
on the steps of the airport, narrowing again as a dark figure dashed 
out of a dark ally to the right before it slipped into the waiting 
car, speeding off in the opposite direction.

&#147;what the hell?&#148; Ruka whispered, resisting the urge to go speeding 
after the other car to pull up to the steps, checking out the bag 
before abandoning it when she heard a soft moan of pain coming from 
the ally.

&#147;hello? Hey where are you?&#148; the blond called, easing herself slowly 
into the moonlit ally. She gasped slightly, running forward as she 
spotted a figure lying across one of the steel crates, her shirt 
ripped open with her jeans halfway down her legs. Haruka closed her 
eyes for a moment, reaching her hand down to feel for a pulse. It was 
weak, but there. Withdrawing her hand, she gasped in shock, looking 
down at her hand. It was covered in blood. From the woman. Someone had 
cut across her neck&#133;
