<h1>Memories</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/umisetsu.html">Umisetsu</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a glorious November day. All was calm and peaceful. There were 
birds singing, cicadas chirping, and there wasn&#146;t a cloud in the sky. 
As expected, the senshi were gathered for a joyous occasion; Chiba 
Mamoru&#146;s private funeral. Usagi and Rei were laughing and talking 
together, to high spirited to fight on this day. Makoto was at the 
barbecue grill talking to Minako while Ami and Setsuna were emerged in 
conversation about books. Haruka and Michiru had brought their 
instruments and were playing a beautiful duet together with the 
keyboard and violin while Hotaru and Chibi-usa were playing make-out 
freeze tag with each other. No one there could have been happier. 
While she was talking, Ami pulled out her palm pilot to make a note to 
read a book and saw a current news flash displaying on the screen. 

&quot;Setsuna, look at this. You might be a little surprised.&quot; 

&quot;What is it Ami-chan?&quot; 

Ami just pointed at the screen and smiled for some moments. According 
to the news report, Mamoru&#146;s cause of death was a building fire. Of 
course all of the senshi knew his real cause of death, but no one 
wanted to talk about it. Setsuna giggled and then kissed Ami. 

&quot;Isn&#146;t life good?&quot; 

&quot;It is now.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Crystal Tokyo

&quot;Isn&#146;t it great to see them all so happy?&quot; 

&quot;Yes it is, my love.&quot; Said Serenity as she turned and gave Mars a 
short, but sweet and tender kiss. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Back in the present

The senshi were all having so much fun they barely noticed it was 
getting late. Haruka and Michiru offered to let Chibi-usa stay over 
for the night and Usagi was glad to let her go. The other senshi 
walked off to their cars and took off to their homes. As Ami and 
Setsuna drove off to their home they shared with Haruka and Michiru, 
neither spoke both enjoying the pleasant silence and cool breeze. Ami 
closed her eyes and lay her head back. This atmosphere reminded her 
of&#133;.. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I don&#146;t know how I&#146;m supposed to put this exactly Mizuno-san but, 
I-I&#146;m in love with you. And before you say anything I just want you to 
know that I can&#146;t stop loving you even if you are angry with me and 
hate me and never want to talk to me again. I would really understand 
if you nev---&quot; 
Ami pulled her into a tight embrace and gave her sweet kiss that cut 
her off. This moment seemed to last forever until both remembered the 
need for air. Ami blushed furiously and Setsuna just stood there. For 
the first time since the ice senshi had known the tanned woman, 
Setsuna was dumbfounded. 

&quot;The truth is, I&#146;ve always loved you Setsuna. I just never found the 
words to tell you.&quot; Ami said while looking down, too nervous to say 
anything else. The two stood in silence for some time both enjoying 
the pleasantness of it and the cool breeze. 

&quot;Um&#133;.Ami-san?&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;Will you be my g-g-girlfriend?&quot; 

Ami nodded and pulled Setsuna in for another kiss&#133;.. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Ami-chan! Ami-chan! Are you still in there Ami-chan?&quot; Setsuna said 
while waving her hand in front of the other woman&#146;s face. 

&quot;Huh, what?&quot; 

&quot;Were home. That party must have you really tired.&quot; 

&quot;Does anyone remember that that was supposed to be a funeral?&quot; 

&quot;Probably not.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, oh well then.&quot; 

Setsuna got out of the car and walked around to Ami&#146;s side. 

&quot;Come on, I&#146;m a bit tired myself so lets get some sleep.&quot; The time 
senshi said as she opened Ami&#146;s door for her. Both walked inside the 
house hand-in-hand, each wondering what the other was thinking. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Usagi sighed as she closed her eyes. The cool breeze and beautiful 
sunset were perfect from her spot under a large cherry tree in back of 
the Hikawa temple. She tried to recall all the times she wasted such 
beautiful scenery on Mamoru but came up short. She had Rei now and 
that was all that mattered. 

&quot;I brought you a soda.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; 

&quot;No prob.&quot; Rei said while handing Usagi the soda. She took a seat 
behind Usagi and idly ran her fingers through the soft blonde tresses. 

&quot;Whaddaya&#146; thinking about?&quot; 

&quot;Nothing really. I was just thinking about how great it is that he&#146;s 
finally gone.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I never did like him anyway.&quot; 

&quot;I&#146;m being serious baka. I still can&#146;t believe that he did that.&quot; 

&quot;Me neither, I knew he was a jerk but I didn&#146;t think he&#146;d take it that 
far.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Two weeks earlier

&quot;I told you already that I&#39;m not in love with you anymore!!&quot; Usagi 
said as she stormed off. 

&quot;But why Bunny?! Our love is destined, just look to the future and it 
will tell you.&quot; 

Usagi spun around and glared at him. &quot;DAMMIT MAMORU!!! I told you 
already that I don&#39;t love you anymore!! Rei is the one I love not you 
so leave me alone and let me be happy!&quot; 

&quot;That faggot? Ha! You need a real man Usagi, not some dyke with a 
strap-on.&quot; 

&quot;WHAT DID YOU SAY!!!???&quot; 

&quot;You heard me. You still love me and you know it, so don&#39;t let her 
corrupt your mind anymore. Your so innocent Bunny, she&#39;s no good for 
you.&quot; 

Usagi lowered her voice to its deadliest register. &quot;You are wrong. I 
never even loved you in the first place. And if you ever insult Rei 
again I will fucking kill you. And I will do everything in my power to 
do that. So get the hell out of my site before I kill you were you 
stand.&quot; 

Mamoru stood there in shocked silence as Usagi smacked him and stormed 
away. He couldn&#39;t believe that Usagi had just spoken to him like that, 
or hit him. He didn&#39;t even know that she knew those words. Were did he 
go wrong? He was the victim, it wasn&#39;t his fault that Rei had messed 
with his Bunny&#39;s head. Like a hammer, an idea struck him. If he 
couldn&#39;t have Usagi, no one could. He smiled evilly as a plan formed 
in his mind. Rei was going to pay, and he was going to do everything 
in his power to make sure of it. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Usagi sighed again and leaned against Rei. Deep down inside, a small 
part of her was still missing Mamoru but she didn&#39;t dwell on that. 
What was important was the here and now. Rei was with her and she had 
Chibi-usa. Life couldn&#39;t get better. Rei put her arms around Usagi and 
snuggled closer to the blonde. It was moments like these that made her 
heart pound and her blood thunder in her ears. She couldn&#39;t help but 
think back to the day that made Mamoru&#39;s funeral one of the most 
joyous occasions that ever happened&#133;.. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;See you tomorrow Akemi!&quot; Rei said as her friend turned off in the 
opposite direction. It was finally Friday and she could enjoy a 
peaceful weekend with her girlfriend. Or that is what she thought. 

&quot;Rei, may I talk to you for a minute?&quot; Rei turned around and saw 
Mamoru standing by the front gate at her school. 

&quot;What do you want Mamoru?&quot; Rei said in an annoyed tone. Usagi had 
appeared at the shrine the previous night crying and told Rei about 
what had happened. She told Usagi that she would do everything she 
could to protect her from him. 

&#147;I just want to talk to you.&#148; 

&#147;Well I don&#146;t so why don&#146;t just leave me alone?&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m afraid I can&#146;t do that.&#148; 

&#147;Nani?&#148; 

&#147;You heard me bitch.&#148; He sneered at her through clenched teeth. 

Rei walked up and slapped him. &#147;You will never address me by that.&#148; 

Mamoru laughed and grabbed her arm, shaking her hard. &#147;You know, you 
really should leave her alone and find yourself another bitch. Usagi 
is innocent, sweet, and mine so just give up.&#148; 

&#147;You are wrong, Usagi is mine and you just can&#146;t handle that. Be a man 
and grow up Mamoru, she never even loved you anyway so just give up 
and move on.&#148; 

Mamoru slapped Rei as hard as he could. &#147;Don&#146;t talk to me like that. I 
know that she loves me so I&#146;m going to make you pay for taking her 
away.&#148; 

Rei reached into her pocket and pushed the button on her communicator 
so that it would contact Usagi immediately. Mamoru had gone out of his 
head and she had a feeling that this wasn&#146;t going to end well. 

&#147;Were going.&#148; 

&#147;Hell no. I&#146;m not going anywhere with you.&#148; 

Mamoru just laughed and slapped her again. &#147;Come on bitch.&#148; He said as 
he started dragging her along with him. 

&#147;Help me someone!&#148; Rei shouted as Mamoru shoved her into his car 
trunk. Rei would&#146;ve transformed but she couldn&#146;t risk it in public. 

Mamoru closed the trunk and got into the front seat. As he pulled off, 
he failed to notice the blonde running after him yelling stop. Usagi 
ran into a small dark alley a few feet away from the school and 
transformed into Sailor moon. She took out her communicator and 
notified the rest of the senshi that Rei was in trouble and then leapt 
onto the nearest rooftop. She looked at her communicator to see were 
Mamoru was heading and raced amongst the rooftops after them until she 
found herself at a small abandoned warehouse. She jumped down and 
heard a scream of pain coming from the inside. Usagi kicked in the 
door and saw a site that made her quiver with anger. Rei was on the 
floor, a puddle of blood surrounding her, with Mamoru yelling insults 
and hitting her repeatedly. 

&#147;Had enough bitch?! Ready to give up on my Usagi?&#148; 

&#147;Hell no!! She&#146;s mine!&#146; Rei said as a boot connected with her 
midsection. 

&#147;STOP!!&#148; yelled Sailor Moon. 

Mamoru turned and smiled cruelly. &#147;We were just discussing you.&#148; 

&#147;Leave her alone!!&#148; 

&#147;Why should I? She refuses to give up on you so if I can&#146;t have you, 
no one can.&#148; He stated matter-of-factly as he kicked Rei again. 

&#147;She will always be mine.&#148; Rei said and coughed up a little blood. 

&#147;Shut up bitch!!&#148; He scream as he punched her in the face. 

Just as Sailor Moon was about to do something, the other senshi 
appeared and were horrified to see Rei in that position. 

&#147;Moon Crisis Heal&#151;&#147; 

&#147;Sailor Moon, NO!!!&#148; All the senshi said in unison, stopping her 
attack. 

&#147;What?! I want this bastard dead, now!&#148; 

&#147;We all do too but he is a person, not a youma!&#148; Ami said regretfully. 

&#147;Tuxedo star power, MAKE UP!!&#148; Mamoru yelled. Suddenly, the room was 
filled with a bright light. Mamoru spun around a few times striking 
various poses and his clothes faded into a tuxedo. His hair grew long 
as make-up appeared on his face then shortened again. He spun again 
and his shades materialized on. He struck a few more poses and his top 
hat and a rose appeared. He struck his final pose and was done. 

The senshi just stood there with their mouths hanging open. They had 
never seen tuxedo kamen transform and now that they did, they weren&#146;t 
sure if it was good or bad. 

&#147;So Sailor Moon, you and your faggot patrol want to stop me?&#148; 

All of the senshi paused at hearing this. Since when had Mamoru become 
so&#133;..vindictive? 

&#147;LET ME KILL HIM!!!&#148; 

&#147;No sailor moon! Let me.&#148; Makoto said as she took a step forward. 

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t want him to have the satisfaction of letting someone else 
do it.&#148; 

&#147;Go ahead, let her kill me. Not like it&#146;ll do anything, your soul will 
still belong to me.&#148; 

&#147;DAMMIT, I&#146;M KILLING HIM NO MATTER WHAT YOU ALL SAY!!&#148; Usagi yelled. 

&#147;MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!!&#148; 

Mamoru&#146;s eyes widened as the attack started to incinerate him. Before 
it killed him completely, the attack stopped and he collapsed onto the 
ground. 

&#147;W-why&#146;d you stop? Did you realize you still love me?&#148; Mamoru choked 
out. 

&#147;Hell no, I&#146;m just gonna let Mars do it.&#148; 

Mamoru stared in horror at the site of sailor Mars. She must have 
transformed while he was being hit by the attack. 

&#147;So, your gonna kill me, huh? I never thought that I would be killed 
by a dyke.&#148; Mamoru said while coughing up some blood. Mamoru pulled a 
rose out of his jacket pocket and threw it at Mars, but much to his 
surprise, she caught it and threw it down. 

&#147;I will send you to hell with my flames.&#148; Mars said, her voice as hard 
as steel. 

&#147;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&#148; 

Mamoru tried to yell something but was drowned out by the sound of 
flames engulfing his body. At this, Mars collapsed into Sailor Moons 
arms, no longer able to keep upright. 

&#147;We need to get you to a hospital.&#148; Usagi said as she de-transformed 
and picked up Rei who had passed out. 

Ami came forward and assessed Rei&#146;s injuries. &#147;We must hurry, she may 
have a concussion.&#148; 

The other senshi de-transformed and Makoto took Rei from Usagi. As 
they walked off, Usagi took a look back at the charred remains of 
Chiba Mamoru in the now burning building then kept on walking into a 
new future with the one she loved. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Usagi shuddered and a single tear slid down her face. Rei wiped it 
away and pulled the other girl closer to her. 

&#147;What&#146;s wrong Odango-chan?&#148; 

&#147;I was just thinking about that day. I&#146;m so sorry.&#148; 

&#147;You have nothing to be sorry for. It was his fault from the 
beginning.&#148; 

&#147;Oh Rei.&#148; Usagi choked out before she broke down into tears. 

&#147;It&#146;s okay Bunny.&#148; Rei whispered into the other girl&#146;s ear and hugged 
her tightly. 

&#147;I made a promise to you that everything would be alright and I intend 
to keep it. Please don&#146;t cry Usagi.&#148; 

Usagi&#146;s crying slowed eventually and she leaned into Rei&#146;s embrace. 
She knew that what the fire senshi was saying was true and that she 
didn&#146;t have to worry. Everything was going to be fine from now on. </pre>
