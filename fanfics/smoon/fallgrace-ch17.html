<h1>Fallen from Grace (part 17 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Rei stood outside the bathroom, waiting patiently for Hotaru to come 
out. They&#39;ve been to eating contests, concerts, magic shows and Hotaru 
even dunked a guy into the pool. Who knew that girl had such a good arm?

Then again, there were booths she wished they hadn&#39;t visited. Like this 
one with a crazy woman who made coffee bean dolls. As in she bought cans 
of coffee beans and made arms and legs with plastic. The young, but 
obviously insane, woman then dressed them up in, believe it or not, 
specially made DKNY, Armani, and even Versace outfits. She was a very 
rich woman since she had been the top editor of some magazine. But she 
quit her job to pursue her true passion. Needless to say, Rei pulled 
Hotaru the hell away from there when she saw the little army of beans 
with torches and pitchforks...

After that, the wooden coaster caught the shorter girl&#39;s eye and Rei 
obliged... five times.

Ruby lips formed a smile at the memory of when Hotaru came off the ride 
the first time. Her cheeks were flushed, her hair slightly messy and a 
bewildered look on her pretty face. But seconds later, it bloomed into 
the most joyous excitement the miko had ever seen from Hotaru. She 
wanted to see it again, so much it frightened her.

So she told her houseguest that they could go on again. And time after 
time, that look of pure contentment and amazement appeared, causing 
Rei&#39;s heart to race.

And then the fifth time...

The look of joy disappeared suddenly, sending Rei into a minor panic. 
The shorter girl sped for the nearest garbage can... and threw up.

Caught between amusement and concern, the miko patted her back and then 
handed her a bottle of water when she was done. Hotaru&#39;s embarrassment 
was enough to make Rei feel guilty for being even half-amused. That&#39;s 
why she was now waiting outside the bathroom while Hotaru freshened up. 
But other than that, it&#39;s been fun.

Actually, the miko hasn&#39;t had this much fun in years, minus Hotaru 
losing her dinner. When Minako broke up with her, she buried herself in 
her work. It was then that she had her first taste of the habit that so 
disgusted her friends. She went to a club one night and ended up 
completely drunk. The next morning, she woke up with a hell of a 
hangover and in bed with a very handsome man. She forgot about it and 
went on with her life.

And then it happened.

Minako announced she and Setsuna had been together for years.

She could remember Usagi&#39;s gasp of joy when she learned of the 
relationship between the leader of her court and the lonely senshi of 
time. Makoto and Ami were staring at the anxious couple in complete 
shock. Haruka and Michiru, on the other hand, stared at her.

The miko remembered the feeling of her heart breaking all over again. 
She felt her life being sucked out of her and falling into the despair 
and darkness she fell into when the blonde first broke up with her. She 
remembered hating Minako at that moment, hating her for finding someone 
new so easily.

For three years Rei had been mourning and healing from their break up. 
Meanwhile, the blonde was kissing, hugging, touching and loving someone 
else. While the miko tried to climb out of the pit of despair, Minako 
was happy with someone else.

She was angry. She was angry at Setsuna, her friend... one of the few 
people she could go to for guidance. How could she?

All eyes then turned to her. She could feel the pity oozing from their 
gazes. She didn&#39;t need to look to know Setsuna and Minako had guilt in 
their eyes. Nor did she have to look to know that there were tears 
threatening to fall from her Princess&#39; eyes. And she knew that Setsuna 
was cautious and alert, ready to protect her girlfriend should the miko 
lose her temper.

And Rei stood there, blinking dumbly, trying to find something to say. 
Something to do. But she couldn&#39;t. It took her a few minutes just to 
realize her cell phone was ringing.

She fumbled for the phone in her jacket pocket, the jacket she refused 
to take off when they first entered Makoto&#39;s apartment. Her hands shook 
furiously as she flipped open the phone and, thank the lord, was met by 
Utena&#39;s voice. Never had she been so glad to hear from the older woman.

The soft but commanding voice snapped her back to reality. She was Rei 
Hino, a young and already feared business woman. She had to keep a 
fa&ccedil;ade of strength. Breakdowns could happen once she was away from 
everyone else.

Rei remembered the relief that flooded her when Utena told her she had 
to go to Hong Kong. Their business client was delayed there and wouldn&#39;t 
be able to return on time. So, she had to fly out.

The miko remembered telling Utena to book her the flight leaving in two 
hours. She remembered mumbling a &quot;Goodbye&quot; to the others, explaining the 
situation. She didn&#39;t look back when she walked out. But she knew their 
eyes were on her.

........Flashback.......

Rei maneuvered around the tightly packed club with the grace of a 
lioness stalking her prey. But she wasn&#39;t hunting, not for a prey at 
least. Unless you considered alcohol an animal and the bar its den.

Bodies pressed against hers as the crowd moved rhythmically to the 
pounding beat that shook the floor, blasted from the speakers. A club in 
Hong Kong was no different than one in Japan, America or England. There 
was music, people and alcohol. That was pretty much all she needed.

As she reached the bustling bar, she asked for a beer, using the Chinese 
she had picked up from Utena. It would have been better to have used 
English, but she didn&#39;t want to attract any attention. Not tonight 
anyhow.

Rei picked up the beer and walked back onto the dance floor, swaying her 
hips and moving along the perimeter of the mass of bodies. She did this 
a lot, just watch people dance but try not to stick out like a sore 
thumb at the same time. It helped her think.

&quot;Guys... we... I... I&#39;ve been with Setsuna for the past few years...&quot;

The blonde&#39;s words cut through her again and again, widening the gaping 
wound. Minako had had no problems moving on, giving the promises of love 
and forever to another. But she foolishly held onto what once was. She 
foolishly loved and she foolishly still loved.

But now that her ex has announced her relationship with her friend, she 
should be able to move on. Right? Rei Hino was not a love sick puppy 
that clung to the love for a person that forgot her so easily. Rei Hino 
was strong and in control.

If only. She spent the past year slowly piecing together her life after 
two years of wallowing in self-pity. She was working on her Master&#39;s 
Degree, she had her own company with two good friends as partners. Then 
Minako comes and destroys everything again.

It was one thing if they just told her they were together. It&#39;s another 
to say they were together for that long. Were they together even before 
she and Minako broke up?

Lavender eyes narrowed when she drained the last drop of beer from the 
bottle. Slowly, the lean body maneuvered through the maze of tangled 
limbs. She knew that several heads turned to look at her. But no, they 
would not be allowed anything but a glance.

&quot;Another beer please.&quot;

Her English was slightly accented, though that didn&#39;t matter much in 
this city. She didn&#39;t even notice she had switched from Chinese to 
English, too preoccupied to even care if she had. The young bartender 
brought over her drink while Rei took a seat at the bar.

She always knew Minako would find another. After all, she was gorgeous. 
Not to mention kind, nice and just fucking perfect.

But it was the fact that the blonde saved her from a world of darkness 
that Rei clung to the memories. After Usagi&#39;s rejection, no matter how 
gentle it was, the miko felt herself sinking into a pit of loneliness 
and hurt. It wasn&#39;t a surprise, her Princess&#39; rejection that was, but it 
didn&#39;t lessen the pain.

Then Minako came to her when everyone else wanted to &#145;give her space&#39;. 
She pushed and refused to leave her be. She even asked Rei to give her a 
chance, so persistent that the miko had no choice but to agree. And when 
Minako broke up with her, it was the end of a dream, the end of a 
fairytale. Her fairytale.

&quot;Miss?&quot;

In the blink of an eye, literally, the tumble of emotions disappeared as 
lavender orbs focused on the woman sitting besides her. Her English was 
close to perfect, short black hair framing a tanned face, bringing out 
the pale honey eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m not usually this bold, but may I buy you a drink?&quot;

Rei&#39;s mouth opened instinctively to say no. She was in a time of 
&quot;mourning&quot; and other depressing stuff. But the woman before her was very 
beautiful and she did need a way to get her mind off the whole ordeal.

&quot;I just ordered my drink,&quot; she said simply, watching the woman&#39;s face 
crumble with disappointment. The reaction sent a shiver down her spine 
and a coy smile appeared on her lips. &quot;But, you can stick around and buy 
me one when I&#39;m finished with this one...&quot;

The other woman smiled as she made herself comfortable. She gazed at Rei 
with half-closed eyes, her smile one of the sexiest things the miko&#39;s 
ever seen.

&quot;What&#39;s your name, gorgeous?&quot;

&quot;Rei. Yours?&quot;

&quot;Xiao.&quot;

&quot;Pleasure,&quot; the Japanese woman drawled.

&quot;You&#39;re not from around here. Japanese or Korean?&quot;

&quot;Japanese.&quot;

A seductive gleam appeared in Xiao&#39;s eyes and Rei felt a buzz go through 
her. And it wasn&#39;t the beer...

&quot;Are you here for business or pleasure?&quot;

The senshi could hear the bait in the woman&#39;s voice. But she 
nonchalantly sipped her drink, letting the question hang in the air. 
After a few seconds, she turned to the expectant woman and smiled, eyes 
hooded by her long lashes.

&quot;Both.&quot;

...........End ...........

And from that day on, she started the whole sleeping around thing. It 
made her forget that she wasn&#39;t loved, wasn&#39;t perfect anymore, but was a 
completely mess. But the deeper she got, the more it took to numb out of 
the world.

And so when she found herself standing in the park for a festival and 
the last time she&#39;d slept with someone was almost a week ago, it was... 
unbelievable. She never knew she could be this relaxed without sex or 
alcohol.

&quot;Hino-san?&quot;

Rei looked up at the sound of her name, finding Sara, Hikari, Megumi and 
a handsome young man she didn&#39;t know standing only a few feet away. She 
smiled as they approached.

&quot;Good evening. What are you guys doing here?&quot;

Sara smiled brightly. &quot;Enjoying the festivities. You?&quot;

&quot;Same.&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;s Hotaru?&quot;

Hikari elbowed Megumi for her rudeness but neither Rei nor Megumi paid 
it any heed.

&quot;Hotaru? In the Ladies&#39; Room.&quot;

Just then, the woman in question walked out of the bathroom, hair in 
disarray and face paler than usual. Megumi stepped forward at the sight 
of the girl, glare trained on Rei.

&quot;Oh, guys, hey.&quot;

The miko watched as the four crowded around Hotaru. She wanted to make 
sure her houseguest was okay as well, but with the looks they were 
shooting her, approaching the younger girl was a bad idea.

&quot;Hotaru,&quot; Sara whispered, stroking her friend&#39;s hair, &quot;you don&#39;t look so 
good. Do you want something to eat?&quot;

The senshi groaned and buried her face in her hands. Megumi turned, 
ready to launch herself at Rei. The rage in her eyes caused the miko&#39;s 
own anger to grow. She&#39;d never hurt Hotaru, contrary to what her friends 
thought. But for the younger senshi&#39;s sake, she didn&#39;t let her anger 
show and stared Megumi down.

&quot;Ru,&quot; the miko said, using the nickname in public for the first time, 
&quot;wanted to go on the coaster. We should have stopped the fourth time we 
were on it, but we didn&#39;t.&quot;

The guy winced while Hikari and Sara began comforting the sick girl. 
Megumi, however, didn&#39;t back down.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you go into the bathroom with her?&quot;

The miko&#39;s eyes flared to life with rage, not bothering to hide her 
feelings. She was ready to speak when Hotaru&#39;s soft and obviously 
uncomfortable voice stopped her.

&quot;I asked Rei not to and told her that if she did I was going to walk 
home.&quot;

Megumi calmed but her glare didn&#39;t waver. She turned to comfort Hotaru, 
keeping the businesswoman away from her houseguest.

Rei&#39;s anger flared even more at the action. She cared about Hotaru just 
as much, no, more than Megumi did. How dare she keep her from the girl?

Hotaru was pale and quite a bit sweaty. She rested her head on Sara&#39;s 
shoulder, who sat besides her, wiping the sweat from her friend&#39;s brow. 
Hikari stroked her black hair while Megumi knelt before her, holding her 
small hands. Rage was pushed aside by concern. The college student 
looked worse than she had expected. Perhaps she should take her home.

Rei detached herself from the group only to come back minutes later with 
a bottle of water. She walked past the guy, ignored Megumi&#39;s accusing 
glare and brushed off Hikari&#39;s cautious look.

Hotaru looked up, feeling the miko approach. She could see Rei&#39;s 
concern, but the indifferent expression made it hard for even her to 
find it. The miko handed her the bottle, which she took appreciatively. 
The bottle was soon uncapped and drained. Once done, the girl felt much 
better.

Gentle fingers lifted her chin up to stare into the mesmerizing lavender 
eyes that gazed at her affectionately. The businesswoman&#39;s expression 
softened.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Hotaru whispered, smiling softly, &quot;much better.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

Megumi&#39;s exclamation destroyed the sweet moment, something that almost 
everyone glared at her for. Hotaru smiled and reassured her friend. She 
then introduced Rei to Henry, Megumi&#39;s boyfriend. Despite the poor guy&#39;s 
best attempts, he couldn&#39;t help but ogle the miko. That annoyed his 
girlfriend to no end.

&quot;Rei-san?&quot;

The woman turned at the sound of the voice to find an old man standing 
nearby, a grin on his wrinkled face.

&quot;Kajiura-san,&quot; she greeted, bowing deeply.

&quot;Are these your friends?&quot;

The miko introduced the five youths standing around her and them to 
Kajiura-san, the priest at a nearby shrine.

&quot;Hino-san, I haven&#39;t seen you at a festival for years.&quot;

Rei bowed her head slightly. &quot;I haven&#39;t attended one in a while.&quot;

&quot;Since your grandfather&#39;s death, correct?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

&quot;He was a good man and an excellent priest. You would have been a great 
head priestess, Rei-san.&quot;

Rei smiled wistfully. &quot;Things don&#39;t always turn out the way one hopes.&quot;

The old man smiled kindly. &quot;Yes, I know that. Rei-san, if I may, I know 
you feel guilty about not taking over the shrine over your grandfather&#39;s 
death. But he would be proud of how successful as you are.&quot;

The words cut through Rei, guilt filling her. No, her grandfather would 
not be proud. With what she does, who would be?

&quot;Rei-san, will you be entering the-&quot;

&quot;Onji-chan!&quot;

A young girl ran up to the old man, pulling on his hand. The Shinto 
priest bid them farewell and left to satisfy his granddaughter&#39;s craving 
for funnel cake.

&quot;You&#39;re a miko?&quot; Henry blurted.

&quot;I used to be.&quot;

&quot;Oh, look!&quot; Sara yelled suddenly. &quot;Goldfish!&quot;

The blonde ran over to the booth where goldfish could be won by catching 
them with a paper net, dragging Hikari with her. Megumi and Henry 
followed, curiosity forcing the brunette woman to leave Hotaru&#39;s side. 
Rei took this chance to sit down on the bench.

&quot;Are you feeling better?&quot;

The shorter girl looked at her friend, smiling. This caused the miko to 
swallow, eyes focusing on the pale, but no less beautiful, face.

&quot;Yes, I am. Honestly, you guys baby me.&quot;

Lavender eyes twinkled as the woman leaned forward, a small smile on her 
ruby lips.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with being babied?&quot;

The smirk looked almost predatory... like Rei wanted to eat her up. 
Hotaru looked away quickly to hide her blush.

&quot;Hotaru! Hotaru! Look what Hikari won for me!&quot;

A goldfish in a plastic bag was shoved in front of Hotaru&#39;s face, the 
hand holding it connected to a very happy Sara. Hikari stood on the 
side, blushing softly.

&quot;That&#39;s great,&quot; Hotaru said beaming. Being with Sara was like being with 
a child sometimes.

&quot;Good job,&quot; Rei said smirking, looking at Hikari, whose blush darkened.

&quot;Hold it while I go get something to eat?&quot;

Hotaru took the bag from Sara and watched as the girl dragged Hikari 
with her. She heard Rei laugh besides her and gave her an inquisitive 
look.

&quot;What? They make an adorable couple.&quot;

Hotaru smiled back and gazed at the goldfish. &quot;Yes, they do.&quot;

&quot;A very unlikely couple.&quot;

Violet met lavender as the unspoken message hung in the air. Hotaru 
looked away first.

&quot;Hotaru! Rei-san! Cotton candy!&quot;

The blonde came running back while Hikari followed behind calmly. Sara 
offered the two on the bench a bag of pink cotton candy while Hikari 
offered the blue one to Megumi and Henry, who were still by the goldfish 
stand.

&quot;Thanks, Sara.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t thank me, Hotaru! Thank Hikari! I forgot to bring money again.&quot;

Hotaru sweatdropped as Sara began eating the green cotton candy in her 
hand. The blonde loved to shop but often forgot to bring money. And she 
doubted carnival booths took credit cards.

&quot;Hikari, have some.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Sara. I don&#39;t want any.&quot;

&quot;But, it&#39;s so good.&quot;

&quot;Really, I-&quot;

Before Hikari could protest, Sara shoved some into her mouth. Rei and 
Hotaru smiled as the brunette blushed.

&quot;Hey, let&#39;s go to the game stands.&quot;

Megumi suddenly reappeared besides Hikari with her boyfriend, smiling at 
the thought of games. They all stood and started walking, looking at the 
different booths that caught their attention.

&quot;Guys, I have to use the bathroom.&quot;

The group collectively groaned as Sara bounced from one foot to another. 
This was the fifth time in an hour! Did she have a tiny bladder or 
something!

&quot;Come on, Sara, I have to as well,&quot; Rei said smiling, seeing the 
grateful look on everyone&#39;s face.

As they headed for the bathroom, they noticed a grassy area with 
bleachers and targets under a tiled, sloping roof.

&quot;It&#39;s the archery contest,&quot; Sara said. &quot;Every year there&#39;s a great 
prize. Look at this year&#39;s!&quot;

A large poster was placed by the bleachers. The blonde besides the miko 
gasped.

&quot;That&#39;s the necklace Hotaru wanted!&quot;

Rei perked up upon hearing the comment and looked at the poster quickly. 
It was a pair of silver rings, each formed by a pair of wings touching 
tip to tip and worn on a simple, silver chain.

&quot;She wanted to buy it but the store said they only made one and that it 
was already sold. I guess the city bought it to use as the prize. Shame, 
she really liked it too.&quot;

Sara sighed and headed for the bathroom. Rei followed.

&quot;Where did you say Rei was?&quot;

Megumi tried to stay calm at the sight of Hotaru&#39;s anxious expression. 
That was the third time she&#39;s asked since Sara came back from the 
bathroom alone five minutes ago.

The brunette didn&#39;t understand her friend. She told Sara to stay away 
but obviously wants the woman. She told the blonde how bad Hino was but 
didn&#39;t seem to pay attention to her own warnings.

&quot;She saw a friend and wanted to catch up.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot;

Despite the acceptance and smile, everyone could tell Hotaru was a bit 
upset. Megumi didn&#39;t know who she wanted to kill more: Rei for being the 
cause of her friend&#39;s bad mood or Hotaru for letting the miko have that 
effect on her.

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the archery contest will start in ten minutes.&quot;

Sara jumped at the announcement, blue eyes turning to Hotaru.

&quot;That&#39;s what I forgot to tell you! Do you remember the necklace with the 
rings you wanted?&quot;

Hotaru frowned at being reminded of the one of the few pieces of jewelry 
she&#39;s really, really wanted. Pity it was one of a kind though.

&quot;Yeah, I remember. What about it?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s this year&#39;s grand prize for the archery contest!&quot;

Violet eyes blinked, surprise plain on the student&#39;s face.

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot;

Megumi looked at the curious expression on her young friend&#39;s face. Now 
would be the perfect time to get her mind off of Hino.

&quot;Let&#39;s go then.&quot;

Hotaru opened her mouth to agree but stopped. A torn look appeared on 
her face as she bit her lip.

&quot;What around Rei?&quot;

Hikari needed only one look at Megumi&#39;s face to tell the other brunette 
was getting more pissed by the minute. To avoid any trouble, she jumped 
in quickly.

&quot;You have your cell right? Just call her.&quot;

The youngest senshi contemplated her friend&#39;s suggestion. She really 
wanted to wait for Rei, but the others looked really eager to see the 
contest. With a soft sigh, she relented and took out her cell.

A smirk appeared on her features when she hit five on the speed dial. 
One was for Michiru and Haruka, since the two were joined at the hip 
like the other couples. Two was Ami, but if you could get through to 
Ami, Makoto was probably with her. Three was for Minako&#39;s cell, but also 
the number to contact for Setsuna. Four was Usagi&#39;s cell. Five was Rei, 
the only one without someone...

The smirk disappeared when Rei&#39;s voice mail picked up. Doing the only 
thing she could, Hotaru left a message.

&quot;All right,&quot; she mumbled to her friends, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;

The stands were packed, not surprisingly. They managed, somehow, to snag 
seats in the middle of the fourth row. Sara was happily munching on 
popcorn, much to the amusement of Hotaru but the exasperation of Megumi. 
Hikari, of course, bought the snack for her but wisely refused to buy 
her something to drink.

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; the voice boomed over the speakers. Everyone 
silenced immediately. &quot;Welcome to the 11th annual Spring Festival. As a 
yearly tradition, the archery contest is the main event. Please, welcome 
our contestants.&quot;

The audience applauded as the participants filed in and there were both 
men and women. Five pairs of eyes widened when Rei filed out behind a 
muscular blonde man.

&quot;Is that Hino-san!&quot; Henry practically screamed.

&quot;Oh!&quot; Sara cried. &quot;Now it makes sense! Rei-san disappeared after I told 
her Hotaru wanted the necklace!&quot;

Hotaru felt her heart hammer in her chest. Rei entered the contest for 
her? She knew better than to make assumptions, but what else can it be?

Megumi frowned. Did Hino know what she was doing? Some of the 
contestants were amateurs but a few were skilled professionals.

&quot;First in the short range competition is Kaoru Hiroshi.&quot;

The petite woman detached herself from the line and approached the 
shooting line, her movements graceful and completely at ease. With well 
practiced movements, she let her first arrow fly.

Sara jumped to her feet and clapped like crazy when the arrow hit the 
bull&#39;s-eye. Megumi groaned while Hikari pulled the blonde back down.

&quot;Sara!&quot; she whispered heatedly. &quot;Archery isn&#39;t like football or 
basketball! You don&#39;t cheer like that!&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

Hikari sighed. &quot;Because kyudo is a way of meditation and self-control. 
You have to tone down a bit.&quot;

&quot;But I cheered after she hit the bull&#39;s-eye.&quot;

Hotaru smiled softly as Hikari explained kyudo, a patient smile on her 
face. Sara&#39;s head bobbed up and down, listening intently to the 
brunette.

Several archers later, Rei&#39;s name was called. Violet eyes stared at the 
woman as she stood, gracefully walking over to honza or starting 
position and followed hassetsu. The positions and movements of her 
friend, dressed in a white keiko-gi and black hakama, mesmerized Hotaru 
as she watched. Her hair was braided loosely, a few strands framing her 
face. Her face, calm and tranquil, was one of the most beautiful things 
the college student had ever seen.

As the arrow sped through the air, Hotaru felt her breath catch in her 
throat. The wind encircled Rei, tugging on her robs and playing with her 
raven locks. The arrow hit the bull&#39;s-eye and Hotaru breathed a sigh of 
relief.

Rei could feel everyone&#39;s eyes on her. But the only ones that mattered 
were Hotaru&#39;s, and how could she not feel that intense gaze? When her 
arrow hit its mark, she barely stopped herself from grinning like a 
maniac. It&#39;s been so long since she&#39;s been in a tournament, after all. 
She only allowed herself a small, satisfy smile.

As she walked back to her spot, she gazed at the bow in her hand.

..... Flashback .....

Rei walked to the group of people nearby. She was more than pleased that 
Sara bought her story. Rearranging her kimono just in time, Kajiura-san 
looked up as if sensing her approach. The old man beamed and all eyes 
turned to watch her.

&quot;Kajiura-san.&quot;

&quot;Hino-san.&quot;

Rei swallowed and gathered her courage. Don&#39;t back out.

&quot;How can I help you, Rei-san?&quot;

&quot;I need to borrow a bow-&quot;

&quot;-and arrows? I was hoping you&#39;d change your mind.&quot;

Kajiura smiled at the blush on the woman&#39;s face. He wondered if the 
decision had something to do with the beautiful girl he saw gazing at 
Rei affectionately.

...... End .......

Hotaru waited anxiously while the last of the archers went. The short 
range round was over and it was time for the long range...

A handsome blonde man stood, the first to shoot for the long range. Only 
three of his five arrows reached the target. The college student was on 
edge as the other ten competitors went. Rei was, again, last.

The miko stepped up, a bit nervous for the first time. Not only was she 
horrifically out of practice, but she had never been particularly good 
at long range.

&quot;Do this for Hotaru,&quot; she whispered softly under her breath.

With that, she took a deep breath and prepared herself, letting the 
worry and stress leave her.

&quot;Come on, Rei,&quot; Hotaru urged, fists clenched.

The miko opened her eyes and went through the steps, finally letting the 
first arrow fly. It hit the target, to her amazement. She released three 
more arrows, all three of them hitting the target though she couldn&#39;t 
see where they hit exactly. An image of Hotaru flashed through her mind 
as she went through the steps, ready to fire the last arrow.

&quot;For Hotaru,&quot; she whispered as the arrow flew across the grassy field 
and hit the target.

She sighed and finished the steps by lowering her bow. She couldn&#39;t see 
where the arrow had hit, but she prayed it was a bull&#39;s-eye. She turned 
and walked back to her spot.

Hotaru waited anxiously as the judges talked amongst themselves. She 
didn&#39;t know about Rei, but she was sure as hell nervous. It probably 
wouldn&#39;t help her nerves to know the miko was just as anxious anyhow.
