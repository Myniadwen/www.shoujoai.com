<h1>A Time and a Place for Everything (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krysbear.html">Krys Bear</a><br> </h2>
<pre>How long is four years? In the grand scheme of things, the be-all, end-
all all-mighty plan, perhaps it is nothing more than a grain of sand in a
never-ending hourglass. Four years of one individuals life, amongst
billions of individuals and endless years.

Surely four years cannot be much.

Or can it?

Fill those years with a longing so intense you feel your heart may
explode if you let yourself even think about how deep it really is. Spend
those four years beside that which you crave most in this whole world, a
hand span away, yet never being able to touch it, possess it. Being so
near....so near you can see how truly far away you are.

Four years can be an agonizing eternity.

Makoto learned this lesson the hard way, long before most do. She had
spent four years lost in the painful limbo mentioned above. Locked
away in a cell of cowardice with the all-powerful Fear as the warden.

But finally, today, she broke free from her self-imposed prison. She had
captured the courage she was so well known for and prepared to use it
for what could be the most important thing in her entire life. Today she
would finally tell Minako, her best friend, what she had many times
before only in dreams.

That she was in love with her.

Makoto had been grinning ever since she made the decision. She was
nineteen years old now. Finished school. The bank had approved the
loan for her restaurant, which she would have ready for business before
Christmas. She had a future, something to prosper with, until the day
came where she, along with the other senshi, lived only to protect Neo
Tokyo and its Queen.

She had more than just empty promises to give along with her heart.
And it was that realization that gave her the strength to decide to lay her
heart out on her sleeve for Minako.

Fate seemed to have a hand in this as well. Not ten minutes after
Makoto had made her decision, Minako called and invited her over for
dinner. Though this was a common occurrence, Makoto took it as a sign
from the gods themselves for her to proceed with her declaration of
love. It was too much of a beautiful coincidence to think otherwise.

She had decided on wearing a pair of black jeans and a white, long
sleeved sport shirt. Now that she wasn&#39;t forced to parade around in a
makeshift high school uniform, she found a new sense of style which
dominated her wardrobe. Gone were the gaudy old Technicolor dresses
and flashy tops, and in went the denim and cotton shirts, and the
professional, clean cut look of Armani suits.

Makoto chuckled and shook her head. &quot;A lot can change in four
years...thank God my fashion sense was one of them. Even if I kinda do
look like a Haruka clone now....&quot; She turned to look at a small-framed
picture by her bedside. &quot;But some things never change...no matter how
much time goes by.&quot; She whispered to herself while picking up the
picture, and stroking the cheek of the young blond girl in it tenderly.

Makoto took a moment to remember fondly how she came to own that
picture. It had been about two years ago, and the five friends had gone
shopping. Minako had seen something in a window that caught her
attention. Her eyes went big and she had that &#39;if-I-don&#39;t-get-that-right-
now-I&#39;ll-just-die&#39; look on her face. She dashed into the boutique, leaving
Makoto, Rei, Ami, and Usagi just standing in the middle of the mall.

When she came out, she was sporting her latest purchase. A revealing
black dress with the playbunny insignia in the middle of the chest.

Makoto had been caught off guard by this, and never realized how much
she was staring until Usagi spoke out.

&quot;Ooooooh!!!&quot; she squealed &quot;You look so good in that Mina-chan!&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami agreed, and grinned slyly. &quot;you do. Why, Mako-chan...you
had better pick your jaw up off of the floor before you trip over it.
Though I&#39;m sure Minako loves the attention.&quot;

Rei grinned evilly. &quot;Yeah Mako...you should take a picture....it&#39;ll last
you longer, girl.&quot;

Makoto turned bright red, not knowing what she could say. She had
been caught red handed. She looked away from Minako and to the
ground, mumbling something incoherent. Before anyone could make
things any worse for her, Minako stepped up to her. She broke out
giggling and handed Mako a picture of herself.

&quot;I always keep one with me,&quot; she said. &quot;In case I see someone who looks
Hollywood.&quot; She slipped into a sultry voice. &quot;Here you go, Ms. Big
Shot Director.&quot; She winked at Mako-chan. &quot;Take this...and think about
me....&quot; She turned on her heel, her mock offer hanging in the air along
with the scent of her perfume. She started slowly walking away from
Makoto and towards the fountain, exaggerating her every step with a
slip of her hips. Then she turned around and blew Makoto a kiss,
causing all five of them to erupt in laughter.

&quot;How....sensual.....Mistress....Mina...&quot; Ami choked out in between
giggles.

&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Rei chimed in. &quot;Minako&#39;s not bad.....she&#39;s just drawn that
way...&quot;

Usagi fell to the ground nearly in tears.

Makoto decided to give in to the insanity. She dropped her voice a few
octaves, and tipped the brim of her cap at Minako. &quot;Here&#39;s lookin at
you, kid.&quot;

Ami now fell to the floor with Usagi. Minako saw this, and realized she
had an opportunity to perform now that she simply could not refuse.
She ran into Makoto&#39;s arms. &quot;No, Makoto!&quot; She cried out. &quot;Don&#39;t leave
me! Take me with you, or stay with me, but don&#39;t leave me with a broken
heart!&quot;

Contagious laughter being all around her, Makoto was battling with her
own set of giggles now. She ticked Minako&#39;s chin. &quot;You know I can&#39;t
stay, sweetheart. I have to go...and it&#146;s too dangerous for you to come
with me. I&#39;ll come back for you. You know I will.&quot; 

Rei fell to the floor, red faced and barely able to breathe.

Then Minako grabbed the collar of Makoto&#39;s shirt, and pulled her down.
She stepped up on her tiptoes and planted a noisy, exaggerated kiss on
her lips. Then she shoved Mako away. &quot;Go then, if you must! Go! But
please, come back to me quickly. I&#39;ll be waiting for you!&quot;

Makoto stumbled back from the shove, and forced herself to laugh with
everyone else, knowing it would look suspicious if she didn&#39;t. Behind
the front she put up though, her mind was racing at breakneck speed.
What did all of that just mean? Was it just for show, as it was probably
intended? Or was there something more...?

So lost in her thoughts was Mako she didn&#39;t hear anything until the
piercing sound of Usagi&#39;s wail broke her out of her reverie. Mina-chan
and Makoto&#39;s show had made her laugh so hard, she started to wet
herself.

Makoto sighed wistfully. ~Sometimes I really miss those old
times...miss feeling like I was...a part of something. Of course we&#39;re all
still senshi...we&#39;re all part of the galaxy...but we&#39;re not together anymore.
I can&#39;t make cookies for them. I can&#39;t goof off with them. I can&#39;t protect
them.~

Ever since they finished high school, the inseparable five senshi had
started to drift apart. Not because they wanted to, but simply because
the world turns. The older you get, the more responsibility you
shoulder.

Rei was running the temple now, since her grandfather had passed
away. She was renovating it, making the old shine like new, in hopes of
making it a noteworthy tourist attraction.

Ami was back and forth between Juuban and Germany, studying
furiously for her dream, her doctor&#146;s degree. Whichever of the two
countries she was in, she lived in a textbook, stepping out of the
medical world only to eat and sleep, and write a letter to one of them
once in a while. (Which wasn&#39;t very often.)

Usagi and Mamoru had gotten engaged, much to Mr. Tsukino&#39;s
disapproval, and had just moved in together. That, on top of Luna&#39;s
intense teachings to prepare her for ruling Neo Tokyo, made Usagi a
rare sight to be seen.

Minako had been accepted into a five star modeling school only a few
miles outside of Juuban. She was top in her class and well on her way
to becoming the world class model Makoto always knew she would be.
Minako was the only one who had stayed in Juuban with Makoto
besides Rei, and the two kept in close contact. Sometimes it felt as if
they were the only senshi left.

That feeling had brought them closer though, if nothing else. Memories
faded to a dull hue, but were never forgotten.

Makoto considered trying to get them all back together for a while. Just
to catch up...to say, hey, I&#39;m here, I&#39;m alive...and I miss being a part of a
whole that has been torn to segments. Maybe she&#39;d hold a private
reunion banquet for them all when she opened her restaurant. With that
plan, she knew at least Usagi would show up, if no one else.
She&#39;d discuss the idea with Minako tonight and see what she thought
about it.

&quot;Ok,&quot; Makoto mumbled to herself, &quot;time for my date with destiny.&quot; She
shook her bangs out of her eyes and slipped on her shoes. She grabbed
her keys from her coffee table and stepped out of her apartment, locking
the door behind her.

She had only walked about five blocks when she saw it. A woman, in
about her mid thirties, had set up a small wooden vendor&#39;s stand on the
edge of the sidewalk. Curious, Makoto took a slight detour from her
route to Minako&#39;s, and went to see what the woman was peddling.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she said with a grin, &quot;I was just wondering if I could-&quot;

&quot;Flowers.&quot; The peddler woman nodded and broke in. &quot;I have the flower
for you.&quot;

Makoto blinked. &quot;Huh? I didn&#39;t ask for-&#148;

&quot;Flowers.&quot; The woman repeated. &quot;You&#39;re going to see her, and you
should bring her a flower. You always do.&quot; The woman giggled. &quot;And
not just any old flower either. Special flower. My flower.&quot;

Makoto decided it was best to just walk away from this. The woman
was obviously a little crazy, and she didn&#39;t want to make a scene. She
tried to think of the best way to make a tasteful departure.

&quot;Come now,&quot; the woman continued, &quot;I have it right here.&quot; She reached
under the counter and pulled what Makoto could only assume was a
flower. She couldn&#39;t quite tell because the woman&#39;s hands were guarding
it as if it were a precious soul secret.

Makoto slowly made her way closer to the vendor. &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; the
woman smiled. &quot;I knew you wouldn&#39;t forget. You told me yourself how
much she adores these. That&#39;s why I grow them special, only for you.
For you to bring to her.&quot;

When Makoto was close enough, the woman opened her hands. Inside
was the most beautiful rose Makoto had ever seen. It was pure white,
with four shades of blue around the edges of the petals. A baby smooth,
thornless stem, with two sweetly curved and rich, green leaves unfolding
on either side of it. It was perfection. She knew at once that she had to
buy it for Minako.

&quot;See?&quot; the woman leaned over and whispered conspiratorially to
Makoto. &quot;I always make them just right. For you to bring to her.&quot;

Makoto only nodded slowly, overwhelmed by the beauty of the flower,
and the sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu flooding her senses.

The eccentric woman carefully cut the stem of the rose on an angle, and
placed it into Makoto&#39;s hand. &quot;Take it now dear...you always bring her
one. It would be silly not to this time. You spoiled her. She expects it
now.&quot; She winked and pinched Makoto&#39;s cheek.

Makoto held the flower as lightly as if she were handling razor blades.
She felt as if her touch could somehow ruin it, wilt it. She prayed it
would keep until she reached Minako&#39;s.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said to the peddler woman. She reached her free hand
into her pocket to pull out the yen to pay for the one of a kind bloom.
&quot;If you could just tell me how much it is...?&quot;

The woman shook her head and shooed her away. &quot;No no no...I told you
before you already paid me more than its worth. Get going now dear.&quot; 

Makoto was confused. &quot;Hey wait...I didn&#39;t pay you. Come on now, I just
want to give you the money for it-&quot;

&quot;Get going!&quot; The woman barked. &quot;You don&#39;t have nearly enough time as
it is! Go now!&quot;

Makoto shook her head and backed off from the woman, who seemed to
be getting annoyed with her. &quot;Well, ummmm...thank you then, ma&#39;am.
Thank you very much.&quot; She said quietly, cupping the rose in her hands.
&quot;If you ever need anything miss...&quot; Makoto turned around to wave
goodbye to the crazy but kind woman, only to see she, and her stand,
was gone. As if it had never been there, but in a dream.

&quot;The hell?!&quot; Makoto scowled and carefully checked the area the stand
had been. There was nothing. No indentation in the grass where it
would have stood. No mark on the sidewalk. Not so much as a petal
floating in the wind.

&quot;Lady? Flower lady?&quot; Makoto called out, wondering if maybe she&#39;d just
slipped behind a corner somehow.

Silence was her only answer.

Makoto looked down into her hands, and saw the rose there, nearly
glowing with its radiance. &quot;I couldn&#39;t have imagined it...I have this...this
is in my hands...I&#39;m holding it, and it&#39;s real...the hell is going on...&quot;

&quot;MAKO-CHAN!&quot;

Makoto was yanked out of her reverie with a noisy greeting and a slap
on the shoulder. She turned around to see a bubbly blond meatball
headed girl smiling at her.

&quot;Hello Odango head,&quot; Makoto grinned, knowing Usagi hated that
nickname. &quot;How have you-&quot;

&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; Usagi shouted, pointing desperately at the rose held in
Makoto&#39;s hand. &quot;Where did you get that?! I&#39;ve never seen anything like it
anywhere!&quot;

Makoto looked down at her sneakers. Telling the truth about this was
out of the question. She didn&#39;t want to tell anyone about it until she
figured out what was going on. &quot;Umm...well...I bought it from a woman
selling them in the street...er...I got the last one.&quot;

Usagi looked crestfallen. &quot;Well, do you know where she went? Maybe
she could get a hold of one more for me?&quot;

Makoto broke out into a laugh. &quot;Oh yeah, like you need any more roses.
Or did you suddenly forget who your boyfriend is? You&#39;re up to your
ears in roses, Odango head!&quot;

Usagi started to whine. &quot;But none of them are like that one! That one
looks so...so...special. All I get are plain old run of the mill red ones!
Nothing like that one!&quot;

Makoto sighed and mumbled something about tracking down that
flower vendor for Usagi later. Satisfied with that, Usagi stopped her
wailing and became her perky self again. &quot;Thanks, Mako-chan. You&#39;re
the greatest.&quot; She gave Makoto a hug. &quot;I have to get going now, Luna&#39;s
waiting for her food.&quot; Usagi held up a bag she had been holding with
Luna nummies inside of it.

&quot;All right,&quot; Makoto nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later then.&quot;

&quot;Er...wait.&quot; Usagi grabbed at Mako&#39;s arm. &quot;Before you go, I was just
wondering...what do you have that flower for anyways? I mean, you just
don&#39;t seem the type to, well, be gathering flowers.&quot;

~Ah, you think I&#39;m too butch to appreciate beauty, huh Usagi? No...I&#39;m
not that far. Haruka maybe...but not me. I suppose I seem that way
though, compared to the rest of you. I&#39;ve led a different life. I&#39;ve changed
in more ways that you can imagine. I&#39;m stronger because of it. And, I
guess, a lot more masculine too.~ &quot;It&#39;s not for me, Usagi.&quot; ~Might as
well be honest. Honesty seems to be the theme of the day...Today&#39;s
episode of sesame street has been brought to you by the letter H, the
number 1, and the word Honesty...~ &quot;I bought this for Minako.&quot;

Without another word, she turned around and walked away, leaving a
confused looking and very astounded Usagi behind, and for once,
speechless.

Her mind was still racing over the strange disappearance of the flower
lady when Makoto was stopped once more from her journey by a sight
that saddened her. An old woman, dressed in dirty rags and looking half
starved, had taken refuge in a door front of an old liquor store. She
looked up at Makoto, pride shining in her eyes despite her awful
disposition. This woman was not a beggar, and would not be mistaken
for one.

Still, Makoto wanted to help. She knelt down in front of the woman,
and held all of her yen out to her. &quot;Here,&quot; she said. &quot;Take this. I was
given a gift today, and so in return I&#39;ll give a gift to you.&quot; She hoped the
woman would take it if she put it to her in those terms.

The old woman smiled. &quot;Yes, you did right.&quot; She graciously accepted
the yen. &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you here, for a long time now Makoto. I
can see you still have the same kind heart you always did. I will return
to you what&#39;s yours now... and be on my way again.&quot;

Makoto stood up. &quot;No, wait, how do you know my name? Don&#39;t go, we
have to talk! Please answer me!&quot;

The old woman stood up, and seemed to... melt, into a whole new being.
A clean, healthy, beautiful woman, who bore a slight resemblance to the
flower woman. &quot;Take care, Makoto. This is your second chance. You
deserve it.&quot;

With those words, the woman disappeared slowly, until she had
vanished completely. In her place was left only a small, worn looking
plush kitten.

Slowly, Makoto knelt down and picked it up. The moment she touched
it, she was bowled over with a flood of emotion, and memories. She
looked at it, her vision hazy. &quot;Peeko... &quot; She whispered softly.

And then... she remembered. Everything.
