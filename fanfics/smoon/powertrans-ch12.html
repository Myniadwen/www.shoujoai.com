<h1>Power Transcendent (part 12 of 31)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessica.html">Jessica</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/powertrans-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Muon walked through his wide workshop, followed closely by Gluon and his 
former second in command, the amorphous Gylax. Gluon&#39;s face betrayed his 
shame and rage at his loss of station. Gylax&#39;s nearly featureless face 
betrayed no emotion at all, a quality shared by her new master. 

&quot;You show promise manipulating my new creations, Gluon.&quot; Muon said. 
Gluon jerked his head towards him, suspiciously watching for any hint of 
smugness or gloating. As always, Muon&#39;s voice lacked the slightest shade 
of emotion, devoid of the slightest inflection. Gluon would almost 
prefer to be bound to one who would lord his victory over the fallen 
general. This deadpan facade was disconcerting and somewhat maddening. 

&quot;Yes, Muon.&quot; He finally replied. 

&quot;You should be ready to use them in combat in a matter of days...far 
sooner than I had anticipated. You may even stand a chance of surviving 
the test alive.&quot; They had reached a corner of the large chamber. In this 
darkened area a large tube stood from floor to ceiling, filled 
completely with a thick, luminous violet liquid. 

Muon looked at the object carefully, then turned his gaze to the floor 
before it. An array of blue symbols and characters suddenly flashed into 
life, centered around the tube. They moved and shifted slowly, and as 
Muon lifted his hand, several of them changed position or vanished 
completely. He nodded in satisfaction. 

Gluon, his rage overcome for a moment by curiosity, approached as the 
symbols vanished. &quot;What have you got in here...?&quot; The violet liquid 
shifted, and deep within the tube a dark shape could be seen, thrashing 
violently. Numerous tendrils surrounded it, lashing about as if each had 
a mind of it&#39;s own. 

&quot;Another weapon to use against the Sailor Senshi...or so I have 
planned.&quot; Muon said, offering no further explanation. He turned away 
from the tube, and his new servants followed after. 

Gylax spoke for the first time, her hollow, whispering voice just 
audible over the noise of the numerous devices scattered throughout the 
chamber. &quot;My master...is it wise to allow Gluon to use your weapons in 
the field without supervision?&quot; Gluon glared at her angrily, and Gylax 
studiously avoided looking back. 

&quot;No, it is not. That is irrelevant, though. I will be supervising his 
actions directly. I have concerns of my own with the Sailor Senshi.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Gluon almost snapped. &quot;What is it you want? Why are you even 
here? You don&#39;t seem to care about anything!&quot; Gylax quailed at the 
disrespectful outburst, but it didn&#39;t seem to phase the blue-clad man in 
the slightest. 

&quot;I have learned all I care to about the universe as we see it.&quot; Muon 
said, his voice as even and dull as ever. &quot;It has never brought me joy, 
and it has long since ceased to interest me. However, I have learned 
things that suggest that there is more to discover beyond the universe 
as I know it.&quot; He paused, looking around the room, the various arcane 
and mechanical devices, the myriad shelves filled to the brim with books 
and documents.

&quot;That is what I seek. A way of transcending my limitations, to find what 
more reality has to offer me.&quot; A sudden bell-like tone made all three 
look up. The sound indicated a summons from Meson in the caverns far 
below Tokyo. &quot;I must go. Gylax, you may accompany Gluon and oversee his 
training with my creations.&quot; 
 
Gylax bowed slightly. &quot;Yes, Muon. Shall I prepare Gluon&#39;s former offices 
and chambers for you to occupy?&quot; 
 
Muon looked at her with the curiosity a human would turn towards an 
insect behaving oddly. &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous. I am not taking his former 
duties and I have no need of any chambers but this one.&quot; He vanished 
then, leaving the daeva and the disgraced Gluon alone. 

After a moment, Gylax turned to Gluon. &quot;It is safe, Master Gluon.&quot; 

Gluon clenched his fists tightly and paced a wide circle around Gylax, 
swearing incoherently. &quot;To be talked about as if I were not in the 
room!&quot; He finally roared. &quot;To have to bow and scrape to that frozen, 
arrogant bastard! It is all I can do not to throttle him every time he 
speaks to me!&quot;

Finally, he stopped, breathing heavily. &quot;Thank you Gylax...your 
continued loyalty means more to me than you know.&quot; He straightened. &quot;You 
will be well rewarded once I have regained what I have lost.&quot; 
 
&quot;Yes Master Gluon. What are we to do.&quot; 
 
&quot;Come.&quot; Gluon made his way to the wall of Muon&#39;s workshop where his new 
weapons waited. &quot;You can help me complete the &#39;modifications&#39; I am
making to Muon&#39;s toys.&quot; 

Gylax followed obediently. &quot;Modifications, Master?&quot; 
 
Gluon giggled as he began to work, a cracked, desperate sound. 
&quot;Yes...Muon will die by his own creations, and I will kill the Sailor 
Senshi despite his &#39;defective&#39; weapons. Lady Meson will have no choice 
but to reinstate me after such a victory!&quot; He continued to giggle 
mindlessly as he worked, his mind entirely consumed with rage and 
thoughts of vengeance.  

-------------------
 
&quot;Here you go Ami-chan.&quot; Ami looked up as a cherry milkshake was put in 
front of her. 

&quot;Thanks, Unazuki-chan.&quot; Ami smiled at Motoki&#39;s red-haired little sister. 
Unazuki returned the smile cheerfully and went over to her next table. 
Ami sipped her milkshake and waited. Just a few minutes later, Mamoru 
entered Crown Fruit Parlor.

&quot;Hi Ami-chan.&quot; He greeted her as he pulled off his jacket and sat in the 
booth across from her. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late, but I didn&#39;t get your message 
until my last class was over.&quot; 

Ami smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Mamoru-kun. I haven&#39;t been here long 
at all.&quot; 

Mamoru waved shortly at Unazuki, who indicated that she&#39;d be there in a 
second. He shook his head in denial and just lifted a finger. Unazuki 
nodded, and made a mental note to bring out Mamoru&#39;s usual, a piece of 
strawberry cake and a cup of coffee. 

That done, Mamoru turned back to Ami. &quot;So, what&#39;s so important that 
you&#39;re blowing off cram school to talk to me?&quot; He smiled, asking the 
question casually despite his heightened curiosity. 

Ami shrugged slightly. &quot;Oh, nothing in particular...&quot; She trailed off 
and took another sip of her shake, looking off into the distance through 
the nearest window. Mamoru just nodded. He knew this routine. Whenever 
Ami had to talk about something that was emotional for her, it took her 
some time to build her courage enough to speak. So he simply waited, 
offering thanks to Unazuki when she came by a short time later with his 
order. 

Finally, as Mamoru was on his second bite of cake, Ami spoke up. &quot;I&#39;m 
going to help Minako move back into her house this evening.&quot; She said 
softly. 

&quot;It&#39;s probably about time...she&#39;s been away for awhile.&quot; Mamoru noted. 
&quot;Is she going back to school as well?&quot; 
 
Ami shook her head. &quot;No...her ribs are still too damaged.&quot; Mamoru gave 
her a somewhat questioning look, and Ami shrugged in return. &quot;I know...I 
don&#39;t know how she&#39;s going to hide it from her mother either, but she 
says it isn&#39;t a problem.&quot; 
 
&quot;Hmm.&quot; Mamoru took a bite of cake. &quot;It&#39;s very kind of you to help her 
get settled back in at home.&quot; He said after washing it down with a sip 
of coffee. &quot;You two have become very close over the last couple of 
weeks.&quot; 

&quot;Has it really only been that long?&quot; Ami mused, mostly to herself. &quot;It 
seems like so much longer.&quot; 
 
&quot;Well, things have been a bit busy lately.&quot; Mamoru replied laconically. 
That got a chuckle out of Ami. 
 
&quot;Yes, just a bit.&quot; She sighed then, and resumed staring off into space. 

Mamoru looked concerned. &quot;Did something happen between you two?&quot;

Ami gave a half-hearted shrug. &quot;No...&quot; A half-mocking little smile 
appeared on her lips. &quot;Maybe that&#39;s the problem.&quot; 
 
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s the...&quot; Mamoru&#39;s eyes widened in sudden comprehension. 
&quot;Oh...oh!&quot; He settled back in his seat, still looking somewhat stunned. 
&quot;I had no idea...&quot;

Blushing furiously, Ami hid behind her shake. Seeing her reaction, 
Mamoru was quick to reassure her. &quot;Ami-chan, there&#39;s nothing wrong with 
feeling that way.&quot; He said with a smile. &quot;You&#39;re free to love whoever 
you want.&quot; Ami visibly blanched at the word love and Mamoru winced a bit 
in embarrassment. &quot;Too strong a word at this point?&quot; 

&quot;Just a bit.&quot; Ami said with a small, somewhat sad smile. She didn&#39;t say 
anything for a long moment.

&quot;Then what, Ami-chan?&quot; Mamoru asked softly, gently pushing her to speak. 

Ami sighed deeply. &quot;Honestly, I&#39;m not sure. I know I feel very strongly 
towards her.&quot; Her eyes went a bit distant. &quot;Very strongly...&quot; She looked 
back at Mamoru. &quot;But love? I don&#39;t have enough experience with it to 
know.&quot;

&quot;And what about Minako?&quot; Ami looked at him in surprise, and Mamoru just 
smiled in return. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t have talked to me about it unless you&#39;d 
already talked to her.&quot; 

Ami smiled back. &quot;I did...last night, at the party.&quot; She took a sip of 
her shake. &quot;She didn&#39;t recoil in horror or anything.&quot; She said with a 
wry smile.  
 
&quot;Well, that&#39;s a plus.&quot; Mamoru said with a small chuckle. &quot;But...?&quot; 
 
&quot;Well...she said, &#39;there&#39;s more here than just friendship.&#39; But she 
seemed...&quot; She frowned. &quot;She said she wasn&#39;t sure how she felt about all 
of it, but she didn&#39;t really act uncertain...it was more like she was 
scared.&quot;

&quot;Scared?&quot; Mamoru tilted his head quizzically. &quot;Of what?&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t know. Of me? Of having feelings for another girl? I have 
no way of knowing.&quot; Ami sighed again and slumped back in her seat. &quot;And 
I don&#39;t know what to do, not at all. That&#39;s why I needed to talk to 
you...I just needed to get this off my chest, and get some advice from 
someone I trust.&quot; 

Mamoru was quiet then, considering. &quot;I think it&#39;s a little early to 
think about &#39;doing&#39; anything, Ami-chan.&quot; He held up a hand at the look 
Ami threw at him. &quot;I know, you really want to do something, but think 
about it. You&#39;re not even sure how you feel yet. For one thing, you told 
me about this, but would you be comfortable telling anyone else? The 
other girls? Your mother?&quot;

Ami bit her lip. &quot;I hadn&#39;t really thought about that...I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Mamoru spoke very softly. &quot;Have you ever felt anything for another girl 
before?&quot; 
 
&quot;I...yes.&quot; Ami looked down and blushed. &quot;When I first realized how I 
felt about Minako, I looked back and realized I&#39;ve always been attracted 
to girls. With boys, it was different. Less...intense. Less real, I 
guess.&quot;

&quot;Well...then Minako aside, that&#39;s something you&#39;ll have to deal with 
sometime, even if it&#39;s not necessary now.&quot; He smiled understandingly. 
&quot;But what you do have to figure out is whether you&#39;re just attracted to 
Minako, or if there&#39;s more there.&quot;

Ami nodded. &quot;That&#39;s true...if this is just some kind of silly crush, I 
guess I can just get over it.&quot; She looked pensively at the tabletop. 
&quot;But what about the way she feels? She did say there was more here. I 
need to know what she&#39;s feeling...I don&#39;t want to hurt her.&quot;

Mamoru was quiet again. &quot;There&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t know about Minako.&quot; He 
finally said. &quot;I think there&#39;s a lot that nobody knows about her. I&#39;ve 
always gotten the feeling that there&#39;s a lot more going on with her than 
she lets on.&quot;

&quot;There is.&quot; Ami agreed. &quot;I was surprised at how much more...she&#39;s really 
much more thoughtful than she likes everyone to think she is.&quot;

&quot;I wonder why that is?&quot; Mamoru asked rhetorically. &quot;Does she ever talk 
about it with you?&quot; 
 
Ami paused, as if a thought had struck her. &quot;No...no, she doesn&#39;t. Now 
that I think about it, every time our conversations have gone towards 
her, she finds a way to steer it away. I&#39;ve been able to talk to her 
about myself...one of the things I like about her is how good a listener 
she&#39;s been. But...she&#39;s never really talked about herself seriously.&quot;

Mamoru nodded. &quot;Somehow, I&#39;m not surprised. I think, if you&#39;re going to 
do anything, you should try to explore that. Try to get her to open up 
to you a little more. If you do, you&#39;ll probably be able to get a sense 
of how she really feels.&quot; He smiled a little. &quot;And if you get to know 
what makes her tick, you&#39;ll probably be better equipped to figure out 
your own feelings.&quot; 

Ami nodded slowly. &quot;Maybe...&quot; A hint of a smile appeared. &quot;Maybe you&#39;re 
right...&quot; She finished her shake, still thinking. &quot;I think you 
are...thanks, Mamoru-kun.&quot;

Mamoru leaned back and smiled. &quot;Hey, no problem.&quot; He looked more 
serious. &quot;I really hope this all goes well, Ami-chan.&quot;

&quot;So do I...&quot; Ami said softly. &quot;I should go...Minako wanted to get home 
before it got dark.&quot; 
 
&quot;Good luck Ami-chan.&quot; Mamoru said with a wink. Ami blushed a little and 
smiled. 

&quot;Thanks Mamoru-kun. I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; Ami left, and Mamoru lifted his 
cup in Unazuki&#39;s direction, indicating his need for a refill.

-------------------

Minako left the guest room, wearing the clothes she had had on when she 
had been brought to the Outer Senshi initially. Hotaru was standing 
there, smiling. &quot;We&#39;ll miss you Minako-chan.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll visit more often.&quot; Minako promised. &quot;I&#39;ve really liked it here.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve really liked having you here.&quot; Haruka said, coming up the hallway 
with a garment bag containing the dress Minako had worn to the party the 
night before. 

&quot;Really Haruka-kun, I can&#39;t thank you all enough for taking care of me 
like this.&quot; Minako bowed as she took the bag, then gasped and winced at 
the pain that flashed through her sides. 

Haruka carefully helped her straighten herself. &quot;Don&#39;t do that with 
Setsuna and Michiru...you&#39;ll break your ribs all over again.&quot; She 
chided, then smiled. &quot;And you&#39;re welcome.&quot; They started down the stairs, 
Hotaru following after. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not going to need more 
help?&quot; 

Minako shook her head. &quot;No way...I really just need someone to make sure 
I get home okay...it&#39;s not like I brought anything with me to move 
back.&quot;

&quot;And of course spending a little more time alone with Ami is of no 
attraction to you.&quot; Haruka said teasingly. 

Minako blushed furiously and make a face at Haruka. Haruka just laughed 
until they reached the foot of the stairs, where Michiru was waiting for 
them. &quot;Minako-chan.&quot; She smiled warmly and gave the blonde girl a gentle 
hug. &quot;It will be terribly empty here without you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Michiru-chan.&quot; Minako replied, smiling back. Haruka gave Michiru 
a little peck on the lips as she passed. 

&quot;I&#39;m still working on my bike...I&#39;ll be back out to say goodbye once Ami 
gets here.&quot; Haruka smiled and headed to the garage.   

Michiru smiled at Hotaru. &quot;I need a moment alone with Minako, Hotaru. 
Could you excuse us?&quot; 
 
&quot;Of course, Michiru-mama.&quot; The dark haired girl smiled and headed back 
upstairs. 

Michiru just observed the Senshi of Love for a moment, then smiled 
softly. &quot;What will you do now?&quot; 

Minako understood the question, and just let out a long sigh. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know...&quot; Minako had related the story of the conversation between 
herself and Ami the night before to the Senshi of the Sea. 

&quot;To put it in the simplest terms possible, Minako-chan, you have a fear 
of commitment.&quot; She chuckled very gently. &quot;You have better reasons than 
most for having it, but it&#39;s certainly there.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d have to agree.&quot; Minako replied, nodding unhappily. She sighed. &quot;So, 
now I&#39;m asking, and I mean it, what do you think I should do?&quot;

&quot;Now that you know Ami has feelings for you as well, you mean?&quot; Michiru 
crossed her arms and closed her eyes, leaning against the banister. &quot;And 
she knows you have feelings for her. I admit, the situation makes it 
tricky. You don&#39;t know if her feelings for you run as deeply as yours 
for her.&quot; She gave Minako a little smile. &quot;And if they are as deep, that 
might be for the best, for now. You&#39;re skittish enough as it is.&quot; 
 
Minako blushed and rubbed the back of her head, but didn&#39;t deny that 
Michiru was right. &quot;You might just consider seeing how things 
progress...don&#39;t deny your feelings, but don&#39;t try to push things along 
because of them either.&quot;

&quot;Just sort of go with the flow?&quot; Minako thought about it. &quot;Do you think 
that will work?&quot; 
 
Michiru shrugged. &quot;Your relationship is going to change, after last 
night. It&#39;s sort of inevitable. But if the two of you are able to accept 
the fact that you have feelings for each other...regardless of the 
strength of those feelings...the change might be less awkward.&quot;

Minako sighed. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right...&quot; Haruka emerged from the garage 
then, sleeves rolled up and shirt stained lightly with grease. 

&quot;Ami&#39;s here.&quot; She said. &quot;Hotaru!&quot; She called up the stairs. &quot;Come say 
good bye to Ami-chan!&quot; 

A moment later, Ami knocked politely and inside. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Come in Ami-chan.&quot; Michiru smiled welcomingly. Hotaru came down the 
steps. 

As Ami approached, Minako tried not to make it obvious that she was 
staring. -What happens now?- She asked herself, trying to swallow the 
knot of fear her throat. -How do things change, after this?- Ami stopped 
a few steps away from Minako. There was a moment of frozen silence.

Then Minako smiled brightly, a light blush on her cheeks. &quot;Hi Ami-chan. 
Thanks for helping me get home.&quot;

Ami smiled back, a matching blush on her cheeks. &quot;No problem, Mina-
chan.&quot; They continued smiling at one another, the tension drained out of 
the room.

-That wasn&#39;t so bad.- Minako told herself. -This just might work.-

Behind her, Haruka began to make an &#39;awww&#39; sound, but Michiru dug her 
elbow sharply into Haruka&#39;s side. The &#39;awww&#39; turned abruptly into a loud 
&#39;ouch!&#39; And both Minako and Ami turned to look at her. Haruka coughed 
and smiled weakly. &quot;I guess I pulled something in the garage.&quot; 

Minako took a deep breath and looked around. It was amazing to her how 
much more this place felt like home than the cold house she was 
returning to...she&#39;d really miss it here. &quot;Well...&quot; She finally said. &quot;I 
guess it&#39;s time to go.&quot;

Hotaru was just reaching the bottom of the stairs. &quot;Bye Minako-chan.&quot; 
She said in her rather small voice. Minako turned to the young girl and 
held her arms out. Hotaru stepped up and very gently hugged her. 

&quot;Don&#39;t be sad, okay Hotaru-chan?&quot; Minako said with a smile. &quot;I&#39;ll be 
around.&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah...it won&#39;t be the same, though.&quot; Hotaru pouted a bit, and Minako 
poked the lower lip. 

&quot;Don&#39;t push that out...you look like you want someone to kiss it, and 
Chibi-Usa&#39;s nowhere around.&quot; Hotaru turned perfectly crimson and turned 
away, clapping her hands to her cheeks. 

&quot;Mina-chan!&quot; Ami exclaimed chidingly, the corners of her mouth twitching 
upward. Minako just laughed, as did Haruka. Michiru covered her mouth 
and coughed rather suspiciously.

Michiru was next, and she hugged Minako just as gingerly as Hotaru had, 
giving the blonde girl a quick kiss on the cheek. &quot;Good luck, Minako-
chan...and remember to visit.&quot; 
 
Minako smiled. &quot;I will, I promise.&quot;

Finally, Haruka stepped up. Too greasy to risk hugging Minako, she just 
clasped her hand warmly and moved her head close to whisper something in 
Minako&#39;s ear. What she whispered remains forever a mystery, but whatever 
it was almost made Minako jump backwards, turning just as red as Hotaru 
had a moment earlier. She quickly turned back to Ami. 

&quot;Well, thanks again! Remember to tell Setsuna to call me tonight so I 
can give her a proper goodbye too!&quot;  
 
Ami smiled and bowed slightly. &quot;See all of you later.&quot; As they left, 
Michiru looked at Haruka questioningly and Haruka whispered in her ear 
as well. Michiru gasped and punched Haruka in the arm. 

Ami and Minako walked down the street together, taking the relatively 
short walk to Minako&#39;s house. &quot;Are you sure you didn&#39;t want Haruka to 
give you a ride? I sure she would have.&quot; Ami asked. 

Minako shook her head. &quot;No...I&#39;ve been stuck inside for *way* too long. 
I need some air.&quot; Neither noticed any of the awkwardness both had been 
feeling. Their feelings for each other had been admitted, if not 
explored, and since those feelings were returned, in some form or 
another, they were quietly accepted, rather than hanging in the air like 
a threat. 

&quot;Oh!&quot; Minako said with a grin. &quot;I guess you got your test scores back 
today. How did the practice English exam go?&quot; 

&quot;Um...&quot; Ami blushed and bit her lip. &quot;I didn&#39;t actually go to cram 
school today...&quot;

Minako blinked. &quot;Really? Why not?&quot; 
 
Ami waved dismissively. &quot;I needed to take care of something...and 
besides, I didn&#39;t want to be late getting you home.&quot;  
 
&quot;Oh...&quot; Minako smiled a bit. &quot;Okay...well, I&#39;m sure you did great.&quot; 
 
&quot;Me too.&quot; Ami chuckled. &quot;I had a great tutor.&quot; They continued chatting 
like that for some time, until the walk was about halfway over, when 
Minako suddenly stopped and winced, her hand going to her side but 
stopping short of touching it. 

&quot;Mina-chan? Are you alright?&quot; 
 
Minako gave a pained smile. &quot;Yes...&quot; She took a careful breath. &quot;My side 
just hurts.&quot;

Ami looked concerned. &quot;Are you okay? Oh, we probably shouldn&#39;t have 
walked so far.&quot; She looked around desperately. &quot;I guess we can sit on 
that window ledge.&quot; She said, pointing to a nearby shop. Minako just 
shook her head. 

&quot;No...&quot; She straightened, taking short little breaths. &quot;We&#39;re almost 
there now, we should just keep going.&quot; They continued walking, but 
Minako continued to fall behind, taking smaller and smaller steps to 
lessen the impact of her stride. With every step, it felt like lines of 
fire were racing up and down her sides. 

Finally, Ami let Minako catch up with her, and without a word, slid one 
of Minako&#39;s arms around her shoulder, lifting her slightly and giving 
her a little support. Minako tried to protest, but she stopped as she 
caught Ami&#39;s scent. The intoxicating smell rushed to Minako&#39;s head and 
helped to ease the pain as much as Ami&#39;s support did. 

Looking over, Minako saw Ami&#39;s cheeks somewhat flushed as she studiously 
looked at the road ahead. It looked like Ami wasn&#39;t immune to Minako&#39;s 
scent either, and Minako felt a surge of pleasure that Ami was so 
effected by proximity to her. &quot;Are you...&quot; Ami said in a tiny voice, 
&quot;Are you going to be okay going home like this? I mean, it&#39;s pretty 
obvious you won&#39;t be able to go to school for another couple of days, at 
least.&quot;

Minako just shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s no problem...trust me.&quot; Ami looked a 
question at her, but Minako seemed unwilling to elaborate, so Ami didn&#39;t 
push her.

In what now seemed like too short a time, they arrived at Minako&#39;s 
house. Ami opened the door and carefully helped Minako in. There was a 
noise from somewhere inside, and Minako&#39;s mother&#39;s voice suddenly called 
out. &quot;Mimi...is that you?&quot; 
 
Minako choked back a groan and covered her face. Her mother emerged in 
the hallway, smiling. &quot;Mimi! I was just heading out. I&#39;ll be back late 
tonight, so don&#39;t wait up.&quot; She smiled at Ami. &quot;And hello there...ah...&quot; 
 
&quot;Mizuno Ami.&quot; Ami bowed. &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Aino-san.&quot; 

Minako&#39;s mother smiled and nodded. &quot;Of course, of course. You too.&quot; She 
gave her daughter a peck on the cheek and brushed by the two of them to 
head out the door. 

Ami looked after her, looking a little stunned as the door closed behind 
her. &quot;She...didn&#39;t even seem to know you&#39;d been gone...&quot;  
 
Minako had already left the doorway and was making her slow, pained way 
to the staircase. &quot;She probably didn&#39;t.&quot; She said shortly. Ami rushed 
over and tried to help her again, but Minako waved her away with the 
garment bag containing her dress. 

As she began to climb the stairs, Minako could hear Ami following slowly 
after her. A loud part of her mind really wanted the blue-haired girl to 
go away. Her mother was a part of her life she didn&#39;t want any of her 
friends, particularly Ami to experience...she had invested a lot of 
energy in distancing herself from all of the baggage involved, and 
someone else seeing her mother&#39;s behavior towards her firsthand brought 
it far too close. 

Her ribs were screaming by the time she reached her room, and as she 
entered she found it precisely the way she had left it before she was 
injured. She immediately went to her closet and put her dress away. 
Ami&#39;s voice sounded behind her, very softly and gently. 

&quot;Mina-chan? Are you okay?&quot; 
 
Minako forced her brightest smile and turned back to Ami. &quot;Of course, 
Ami-chan. She&#39;s always like that.&quot; She turned back into the closet, 
brushing her hands over her clothing needlessly, so Ami couldn&#39;t see the 
tears in her eyes. 

&quot;She&#39;s always like that...she never really notices why I&#39;m gone. I mean, 
how could I be Sailor V if she paid me any attention at all?&quot; Minako&#39;s 
voice began to crack, but she was too far down the path to care anymore. 
&quot;She never notices...never stops to talk...never asks how I am...I could 
probably show up with two heads and she wouldn&#39;t notice until she had to 
kiss more than one cheek.&quot; 

The pain, combined with her tightly wound emotions finally got the 
better of her, and Minako collapsed against the doorframe, her forehead 
resting on her arms as she began to cry. &quot;Hell, I could probably drop 
dead and she wouldn&#39;t even care for a month or two!&quot;

That was enough for Ami. She ran to Minako&#39;s side and carefully helped 
her to her bed. Minako was crying all the while, not the deep sobs of a 
broken heart...she had cried those tears out long ago. These were, 
instead, the soft, sad sobs of a lonely girl who had just remembered how 
lonely she truly was. 

Minako found herself laying on her bed, her head in Ami&#39;s lap once again 
as she cried herself out. Ami just gently stroked her hair, making 
small, soothing sounds. Her tears slowly began to subside, and Minako 
slowly became more aware of the pain still in her sides, aggravating by 
her crying fit. 

She sniffled heavily, and Ami silently handed her a tissue, which she 
used to wipe her eyes and nose. &quot;Ouch.&quot; She finally said in a quiet 
whisper. She turned her head to look up at Ami, who was smiling down at 
her sadly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Ami-chan...I didn&#39;t want to you see any of this.&quot; 
She said in a tired, weak voice. 

Ami just shook her head and smiled. &quot;No...I&#39;m glad I did. You&#39;ve helped 
me a lot, just by listening Mina-chan...but I&#39;ve never realized how much 
you were hurting.&quot; 

Minako shuddered deeply, but didn&#39;t cry anymore. &quot;It&#39;s always been like 
this.&quot; She said quietly. &quot;Dad is always, always away on business. And 
Mother had always acted like that. I had a nanny until I was 
eleven...then I was just alone.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Mina-chan.&quot; Ami said, sympathetically. There was a long 
stretch of quiet then, as Ami continued to very gently run her fingers 
through Minako&#39;s hair. &quot;If you&#39;re hurting, I&#39;d like you to talk to me.&quot; 
She finally said. &quot;I&#39;d like to think that you trust me that much.&quot; 
 
Minako sniffled again. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Ami-chan. I don&#39;t know if I can.&quot; She 
said forlornly.

Though Minako couldn&#39;t see it, Ami nodded. &quot;That&#39;s okay Mina-
chan...maybe someday.&quot;

&quot;Someday.&quot; Minako repeated. She closed her eyes. She hadn&#39;t felt this 
vulnerable in a very long time, but somehow, in Ami&#39;s presence, it 
wasn&#39;t as terrifying as she would have imagined. She took a deep breath 
and snuggled her head a little deeper into Ami&#39;s lap. 

Finally, as the sun began to set and the light in Minako&#39;s room began to 
dim, Minako sat up. &quot;Thank you Ami-chan.&quot; She said softly. 

Ami smiled in return. &quot;You&#39;re welcome, Mina-chan.&quot; 

Minako shifted to a kneeling position on the bed, facing Ami. &quot;I...&quot; She 
swallowed. Before she could try to speak again, Ami just put two fingers 
to the other girls lips and smiled. 

&quot;It&#39;s fine, Mina-chan.&quot; She smiled. &quot;When you&#39;re ready.&quot; She stood up. 
&quot;Well, I have to get home...homework.&quot; She smiled sardonically.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Minako smiled softly. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;

Ami nodded. &quot;Of course you will.&quot; She walked to the door. &quot;Good bye, 
Mina-chan.&quot; 

After she left, Minako lay back on her bed, breathing deeply. The sheets 
still retained a hint of Ami&#39;s smell, an intoxicating mix of scented 
soap and a natural, flowery smell. She drifted off to sleep soon after, 
a dreamy, soft smile on her lips. &quot;Ami...&quot; She breathed. 

-------------------
AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: I decided it wasn&#39;t fair to have Usagi be the only person 
clueless about Minako and Ami&#39;s attraction, and Mamoru strikes me as a 
little clueless about matters of the heart...at least outside of his own 
relationship. ^_^

I can&#39;t think of anything else to say that isn&#39;t me childishly dropping 
hints about things to come, so I&#39;ll leave it there. Till next time!</pre>
