<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d never  before had a reason to dislike warp engines, but after leaving Mercury,  Rei found herself cursing the speed at which their shuttle flew back to  the Moon.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">True to her word, Minako certainly had picked up where  they’d left off, and the Priestess hadn’t imagined they could have  spent nearly the entirety of the two hour trip necking and simply  enjoying each others closeness. But then, she guessed anything was  possible when it came to Minako, and it certainly wasn’t like she was  complaining.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It wasn’t that she felt the need to be attached to  Minako at the hip – after all, it wasn’t even like they’d declared an  actual relationship – but when Minako was whisked away from her all too  soon to brief Queen Serenity once they’d hit the surface, Rei had  instantly felt the loss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…and things only went downhill from there.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
At breakfast the next morning, a barely controlled fist pounded the table.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean she’s gone back to Venus!?” Rei exclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto’s  hand lunged for her juice glass and her quick reflexes kept the orange  liquid from spilling onto the table. “We got a dispatch from her planet  late yesterday afternoon. Apparently, the youma invasion is getting  worse on Venus and there was a skirmish outside the main capital.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you guys let her go alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its not that we wanted to let her go by herself, Rei-san.” Ami clarified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess frowned darkly. ‘<em>That  hypocrite! She can’t be allowed to scold me for not accepting her help  the way she did on Jupiter if she’s going to do the same thing to me.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know how she gets,” Serenity pointed her fork at Rei, “all we can do is  support her from here. Besides, we made her promise she wouldn’t fight.  She was only allowed to go if she agreed to check the damage at the  capital, show her support for her people, and come right back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Sure. We promised not to fight the youma on Mercury’s pole, too.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto nodded brightly. “Yeah, and if the youma attack the city again, she knows we’re on standby if she needs our help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei pounded the table again, and this time, Makoto’s juice did splash out of her glass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity jumped to her feet. “Rei-chan, where are you going?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian halted at the door before glancing back over her shoulder. “To Venus!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  slammed the door behind her with an air of finality but she’d no sooner  turned down the next hall than a timid voice caught up to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-san, please wait!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Against  her better judgment, the Priestess stopped and waited for the blue  haired genius to catch up. The small woman stood well outside the  Martian’s boundary of personal space and bit her lower lip nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Before  Mina-chan left, she consulted me about something.” Ami said  tentatively. “I… explained to her about Martian possessiveness, that  when a Martian finds something they deem worth protecting, they go to  great lengths to protect it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you telling me things I already understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because you <em>don’t</em> know about Venusians. Rei-san.” Ami said with a sad frown. “It’s in a  Venusian’s nature to either love freely, or love deeply. I… just don’t  know which Minako is. Maybe she’s feeling she’d led you on with her  flirtatious nature, or…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei seemed unmoved. She crossed her arms over her chest. “Or?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A slight blush dusted Ami’s cheeks. “Or maybe she really is a one lover kind of girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She is.” Rei said simply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How can you be so sure?” A slight smile tugged at one corner of Ami’s mouth. “I thought Minako was the empathic one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She is. But she can’t keep something that powerful from making itself known in her aura.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Mercurian nodded. She wanted to believe in Rei’s certainty. “I just…  don’t want either of you to get hurt. I know Minako’s primary reason  for going to Venus was to help her people, but I know that no matter  how seriously she takes her duties, she’ll also be thinking of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei smirked. “Does she know you’re telling me all this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Ami said, meeting the Martian with a mischievous grin, “and she’s not going to find out, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess offered the smaller woman a rare, genuine smile. “You seem to know a lot about all this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course I do. After all, Martians aren’t too far removed from Jovians.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two women shared a brief laugh that was cut all too short by Rei’s  stiffening posture. She didn’t need a heightened spiritual sense to  detect the presences lingering on the other side of the corner.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know you’re there, Princess, Makoto-san.” Rei said, and then smiled  gently, offsetting her gruff voice. “You can come out now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chuckling  to herself, Serenity turned the corner, trailed by the Jovian. The  Princess passed Ami’s respectable distance from the Martian and clasped  Rei’s hands in her own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should know that despite her confidence and strength, Mina-chan tends to run away from the things she really wants.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess nodded. Her suspicions had been proven correct by those  closest to the Venusian. She found strength in her Princess’ soft smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go get her, Rei-chan.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  golden orb of the Sun could not be seen on Venus, yet it was incredibly  bright beneath the thick, dusty cloud cover that lent a bright, sandy  glow to the planet’s surface.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Palm fronds swayed in the gentlest of  breezes. Limestone walls jutted in every direction; apartments, shops,  and offices fought for space in the teeming city. A dark haired woman  among the golden Venusians, the Martian had to twist and turn her body  to cut through the crowds, earning inquisitive looks and admiring  gazes. She scowled at the attention and wiped at her brow. The arid  heat was nearly oppressive and there were entirely too many steps to  climb to reach the main Venusian Palace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d chosen the direct  route, but then, Rei wasn’t one for playing games and there was no  stopping a Martian on a mission. Finding Minako was her priority, and  if it meant she had to break through the doors of the throne room, then  so be it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She quickly found that she didn’t have to take such  drastic measures. Marching down the middle of a row of limestone  columns in the open-air walkways of the Venusian’s palace’s first  courtyard, it seemed that she had been found first.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Priestess-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Martian turned her attention to two men. She instantly recognized their  tanned, toned bodies from Minako’s traveling party back on Mars. But  there was no time for pleasantries.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where is Minako.” She demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was something so protective, so possessive in those wild, amethyst  eyes, that despite their size and strength, both men faltered before  the dark haired woman’s slender form. They had been ordered not to  reveal their Princess’ location, but could they dare withhold that  information from the Martian standing before them?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One of the two finally broke under her unrelenting glare. “She’s gone north to the pole.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei scowled. “You let her go alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She insisted! Surely you understand that we could not defy her orders.” The other said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” The Martian’s voice dropped to a whisper. “I don’t understand at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She turned then, and began to retrace her steps but quickly found the Venusian guards blocking her path.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Princess Venus said that if you were to come to the palace after her, you were to stay here until her return.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess pushed past the two men effortlessly. “I don’t care what she said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The guards could only stand uselessly as the Martian warrior descended the steps and made her way through the throng.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>So she knew I’d come for her after all.‘</em> A distant smile touched Rei’s lips. <em>‘Maybe she wanted me to find her all along.’ </em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The last thing she wanted was for the Martian to find her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  pole had been a welcome change from those of the other planets. Venus’  constant cloud cover provided an isothermal climate, resulting in  little temperature variation between equator and pole. No ice to slip  on, no snow to trudge through, the worst she’d had to deal with was the  drifting lightening storms caused by distant volcanic activity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  best of all, although a group of the rogue monsters had attacked the  outskirts of her capital directly, the youma presence on the pole of  her planet was minimal compared to those of the other planets. It was a  small amount of relief to Venus’ troubled mind as the pole’s slow but  forceful winds buffeted against her on her return from her successful  solo mission.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian knew the fiery Priestess would be  upset that she’d left without a word. She’d shown Rei many sides of  herself, but not this one; not the part of herself that refused the  help of others, the part of herself that contradicted every other  aspect of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was the part of her that most resembled Rei and she wondered how the woman would handle it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What  was I to do? Drag her to my homeland to conquer that threat too? Why?  This is my problem. What good would a woman with which I have an  undefined relationship with do anyway?’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus hung her  head. She hadn’t meant to be so harsh, even within the confines of her  own mind. She was running away again when she should be facing her  fears, but though the rational part of her recognized that fact, the  irrational part of her refused to do anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I’m just… I’m scared of…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cerulean  eyes that had been open finally took notice of her surroundings. Her  voice was a whisper as her companion closed the distance between them  at a steady jog.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mars…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was only then that Mars, that  Rei herself first realized just how much attention she’d paid to the  other woman; just how much each of Minako’s mannerisms and her  appearance had subconsciously ingrained themselves in her mind. For as  she finally stood before the other woman, panting slightly from her  prolonged jog, she noticed instantly the tiny details that translated  Venus’ emotions clearly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman shifted her weight from foot  to foot as though she’d flee at any moment. Her long, golden hair,  usually so well cared for, was haphazardly tied back into a messy  ponytail. But most of all, Venus’ trademark smirk betrayed her; for it  didn’t reach her listless eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell are you doing here?” Mars opted for blunt confrontation. After all, it hadn’t failed them yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was a mission I assigned myself.” Venus grasped the false sense of  confidence her position of leader granted her. “I hit the pole, took  detailed photos of the access point that Mercury needed, and made it  out undetected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was incredibly dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus  flipped her long ponytail over her shoulder causally. “Without you  slowing me down in your civilian form like you did last time, I was  quite safe as Venus.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t give me that crap. The two of us as <em>senshi</em> had a hard time in that ambush on Mercury. What if you had-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>ordered</em> you to stay behind!” Venus violently cut off Mars’ words.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I may be your subordinate, but I will <em>not</em> heed reckless orders when it comes to your safety.” Rei crossed her arms smugly. “Someone’s got to rein you in, Venus. “</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian’s gloved hands balled into tight fists. She frowned, and began  to stammer. But Mars wasn’t through with her yet – she was far from it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What,” Mars asked, “you can dish it out, but you can’t take it? Don’t you think you’re being hypocritical here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  crimson warrior began pacing around her leader, ever conscious of the  dark glare the golden warrior gave her. “First, you got mad at me for  not accepting your help on Jupiter. Second, you kept me from charging  recklessly into battle on Mercury.” Mars stopped in front of the  Venusian, a stony expression on her face. “Does that sound familiar to  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>don’t</em> need your help.” Venus spat. She sank into  an offensive position. Her golden chain formed in her hand and her  fingers closed around it comfortingly. “And I <em>don’t</em> need your condescending attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Martian smirked. Oh, she’d show the little Princess condescending, all  right. “Don’t you think it’s little ironic that the fight on this pole  is between you and me, and not the youma?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think its quite suiting.” Venus nearly growled as she affected an offensive stance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  sank into a defensive position. A drifting electrical storm shot a  forked spike of lightening through the dusky sky. She had to shout to  be heard over the resulting thunder. “Bring it.” She barked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In a blur of crimson and gold, the two warriors jumped away from each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  bow of fire appeared in Mars’ hands and a fire-arrow shot towards  Venus. The deadly projectile was easily deflected by the golden  warrior’s chain. Too easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden chain regrouped quickly,  and lashed out towards the Martian. She’d seen the deadly weapon take  down youma in a single blow, effortlessly slice them in half, yet in a  leap of faith, Mars easily caught the weapon in a gloved hand and  pulled it taught. Stuck in a stalemate, the two women glared at each  other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That could have taken your hand right off.” Venus said coldly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It <em>could</em> have.” Mars smirked. “But it didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus  snarled at Mars’ smugness, but… she didn’t want to be so far away from  the other woman, either. She gave a tug on her end of the chain, and  unbalanced, Mars was suddenly falling towards her. Venus dropped the  weapon, and with her right hand, unsheathed her sword.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  blades met with the echoing clang of metal on metal that was muffled  only by another clap of thunder. Their shoulders pressed together.  Their faces were so close.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I could almost…’</em> Her  contrasting emotions fought harder than she did. Venus was tempted to  steal a kiss. Instead, she pushed the Martian back so she could breathe  again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Making sure her every movement was being clearly  transmuted, Mars charged, swinging her blade in a rapid succession of  blows that were easily parried as the Venusian skittered backwards on  flat feet. The crimson warrior allowed Venus a scant moment to collect  herself, and the golden warrior took the opportunity, pressing the  Martian back with an equally impressive display of fast, yet easily  blocked moves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars was done playing. She’d gotten all the  information she’d needed. “Is this all you’ve got?” She barked as she  planted her feet and met Venus’ blade with her own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian frowned, but swung her sword again. And again. And again. Blindly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars’ powers were strong indeed, but they couldn’t be stronger than hers. <em>‘No,’</em> she suddenly realized. ‘<em>They aren’t… Neither one of us are fighting to even half our abilities. My heart’s not…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your heart’s not in this!” Mars shouted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus’  blade came down in one, last, halfhearted effort. Her hands shook, her  blade wavered as the two women pitted their strength against the other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s obvious you don’t want to fight me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus’  blade slipped out of her grip and clattered on the slab of rock beneath  their feet. Mars followed suit, throwing her sword to the ground, and  she closed the remaining distance between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Surrender, Venus. Accept my help. Let me be there for you the way you were there for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  golden warrior’s bruised pride made one last attempt, and she pushed at  the Martian’s shoulders, trying to shove the other woman away weakly…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  Mars would have none of it. She grabbed the Venusian’s trembling hands,  hooked her foot behind the other woman’s knee, and took the Venusian  down to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The emotional turmoil had taken its toll, and  when the breath returned to her lungs, the golden warrior was no longer  Venus, but Minako. She opened her eyes to find Mars pinning her. The  crimson warrior had straddled her hips and had captured her hands at  her sides. Mars’ transformation faded in a crimson glow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  sense of utter defeat didn’t change when it was Rei on top of her,  looking down at her with those unreadable violet eyes…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And Minako never would have thought that utter defeat would feel so… liberating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  are you running away from me, Minako?” The venom in Rei’s voice was  gone, exchanged for gentle, imploring tones. “You weren’t running away  from me on our return from Mercury. What’s changed?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Backed into a  corner, the Venusian was out of places to run. She had to face her  fears. “Because I’m afraid of how strongly I feel for you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  recoiled at the intensity of her voice that bordered on tears. Even for  a Venusian, the depth of her feelings for Rei were frightening, a force  inside her that had grown in leaps and bounds since the day she’d met  the Martian. Rei had become her everything, and it had spiraled beyond  the control of one who was so used to being in control of everything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei remained unmoved. “Don’t you see? This isn’t about <em>my</em> sacrifice on Mercury’s pole. This is about <em>your</em> sacrifice on this one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wh.. what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  the one that’s all wrapped up with denying yourself, making yourself  the martyr… Minako, if we feel the same way then what are you afraid  of?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you… really feel the same?” The Venusian’s voice was hopeful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Didn’t Ami go over this with you already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Wrong choice of words, fool!’</em> The Priestess suddenly looked like a deer caught in a set of headlights. She chuckled impotently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The leader of the senshi lifted an amused eyebrow. “She told you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look,” Rei said sheepishly, “maybe you’re going through a lot right now. Why don’t we just see where this takes us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s tentative smirk fell sharply. “Where <em>what</em> takes us, Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  tensed. “This is getting us nowhere.” She quickly steered the  conversation out of dangerous territory. No matter how much she wanted  to tell the Venusian what she wanted to hear, she felt it was too soon  to go there, for both of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And there was only one solution to  avoiding proper topics when it came to her and Minako. “You know, for  all your leadership skills, you suck at proper communications.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  grinned. Her response was automatic. “You’re one to speak, you  recluse.” But then, that smirk slipped and her cerulean eyes suddenly  turned serious. “Rei, I…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shh.” Rei shook her head silenced the woman underneath her with a finger. “Later, Mina.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  other girls called her Mina-chan, but hear the abbreviation of her  name, sans suffix, from the Martian’s raw voice sent a delicious chill  down Minako’s spine. The Venusian leaned up, as much as Rei’s hold  would allow, and gently kissed her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>It’s only been a day but  how did I ever live without her kiss? We can talk about our feelings  later, right? Right now, this just feels far too right.’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  lips parted reluctantly. Minako’s head rested on the rocky ground once  more. Finally, she smiled. “Can you kindly get off me now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Rei frowned. “Oh!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  a slight blush dusting her cheeks, the Martian jumped off Minako and  quickly helped the other woman to her feet. She assisted the Venusian  in patting the dust off her traveling clothes and out of her golden  hair, but before long, her motions slowed. Rei found her hand lingering  on Minako’s waist and finally, their eyes met again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The hold around Minako’s waist slowly tightened, and Rei pulled her in for another kiss that refused to end.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know,” Minako said, as she claimed the corner of the Priestess’ mouth, “I hate it when you’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hn?” The barely coherent question was the result of fingernails clawing at the back of Rei’s neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can finally read the two of us with my senses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your…  love… reading?” The awkward question was asked between carefully placed  kisses to Minako’s neck and the golden warrior could feel the heat of  Rei’s cheeks on her skin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un.” Minako nodded and cracked a grin  that banished every doubt, every worry, every fear she’d foolishly  felt. She pressed two fingers under the Martian’s chin, and forced her  to look at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well?” Rei asked grumpily, “What does your reading say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,” Minako’s grin turned predatory, and her fingers traced Rei’s delicate jaw line, “I think I need to interpret it more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian claimed the Martian’s knowing grin with another searing kiss.</span></p>

Author’s  Notes: A little unhappy with this chapter. I knew what I wanted to say,  but just couldn’t seem to pull it off. For all of Minako’s outward  determination, she’s also been the type to doubt herself and have  insecurities, and I figured she’d have them not only as a leader, but  as a lover. I felt that she needed that bit of extra reassurance, and  this will only strengthen what she has with Rei in the very near future.

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Special Thanks:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiko-Gabriel:  you might be a little disappointed at Minako’s obvious monogamously  orientated nature. I felt this fit her character more closely in this  story. I am, however, trying my hand at a more poly-orientated view of  her in the next fic I’m working on.<br />
  Bomichan: in the last chapter, Mercury wasn’t witness to everything  that happened between Rei/Minako/Mars/Venus in the last chapter. She  went silent for most of the trip to the pole, but signed off completely  after the three of them had worked together at the pole and before Rei  became Mars. So Ami and the others are still in the dark about what’s  going on.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview: Chapter 8: Lunar Diplomats</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lets talk of our next steps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ever  Minako’s equal, Rei had no problem asserting her opinion. “We’ve  searched the planets closest to the Earth, but what of the others?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami fidgeted slightly. “The planets of the outer rim-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Keh!” Minako crossed her arms in a huff.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“-have their own senshi.” Ami continued. “Their reports indicate that the youma invasion has reached as far as Neptune.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wonderful.” Minako groaned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian watched the dynamics between the Venusian and the Mercurian with a confused sense of interest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Their leader will blame me,” Minako clarified bitterly, “blame <em>us</em>, for allowing it to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mina-chan and Haruka-san don’t get along very well, you see.” Serenity added helpfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto snorted. “<em>That’s</em> putting it mildly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway,”  Minako’s frown deepened. “I’m sorry, Princess, but we can no longer err  on the side of coincidence when it comes to the Earth’s involvement in  the matters at hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity frowned. Her eyes dropped to the  ground. All four of her guardians looked elsewhere lest their better  judgment be clouded by their Princess’ disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All of  our clues point to the blue planet.” Minako said quietly. “The access  points found on each planet’s pole seem to be of Earth make. Rei  insists that the signatures of the five individuals we saw time and  again were definitely human. Ami-chan is still researching the data,  but we believe that the location that the access points were pointed to  in order to transport the youma from was Earth as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  whole thing reeks of that damned planet.” Rei spat, and then had the  decency to look sheepish once scolded by Minako’s reprimanding glare.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still,  this will be a touchy political issue, and there is already word that  there is a large amount of civil unrest on that planet. It’s widely  known that the Earthlings harbor mistrust against the Moon Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami  nodded. She called to life her transparent super computer and wasted no  time in analyzing data. “We must also keep in mind that the youma are  not a native Earth species.” She examined Rei and Makoto’s blank  expressions. “That means the youma have technically invaded <em>their</em> planet as well, and though it must mean that someone is controlling  them to their own ends, we don’t know who that is, and we can’t condemn  the entire race of humans.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity rose on shaky legs. “We must meet with their Prince. We must initiate diplomatic relations with the Earthlings.”</span></p>
