<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 10 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>The song is called &#39;When tomorrow comes today&#39; and is sung by Gorillaz. 
I don&#39;t own the song nor Sailor Moon.

After the devastating loss, Mamoru, Usagi, Chibi Usa and Yung Hu made 
their way back to Mamoru&#39;s apartment. Along the way the met with Artemis 
and Luna who also went along with them to the apartment.

When the group reached the apartment, Usagi, Mamoru and Chibi Usa took 
seats on the couch while Luna and Artemis sat on Mamoru&#39;s bed. Yung Hu 
had walked inside the apartment, took one good look around and muttered 
something about the room being too cramped and left for the roof.

After sitting in silence, Usagi decided to go upstairs to visit with 
Yung Hu and asked Artemis and Luna to discuss a plan of operation.

When Usagi reached the top of the stairs, she saw the door was slightly 
cracked. Peeking around it, She saw Yung Hu in his human form perched on 
the railing, his legs bent and his arms resting carelessly over his 
knees. He was staring out over the city, but at what Usagi didn&#39;t know. 
His head was nodding in time with a beat be began to play on his knees, 
his posture nor his balance varying in the slightest. Soon, he began to 
sing a slow song that seemed almost depressing.

&quot;Everybody&#39;s here with me
We got no camera to see
Don&#39;t think I&#39;m not all in this world
The camera won&#39;t let me go
And the verdict doesn&#39;t love our soul
The digital won&#39;t let me go

&quot;Yeah yeah yeah
I&#39;ll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today

&quot;Stereo I want it on
It&#39;s taken me far too long
Don&#39;t think I&#39;m all in this world
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be here too long
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be here too long
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be here too long

&quot;Yeah yeah yeah
I&#39;ll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today&quot;

Usagi quietly walked to stand next to him. She knew that he knew she was 
there, but as he finished singing, he made no move to announce her 
presence.

Usagi finally broke the silence by saying, &quot;I don&#39;t think you could be 
more depressing if you tried.&quot;

Yung Hu remained silent.

Usagi turned to look at him. &quot;Whats wrong?&quot;

&quot;What would you do,&quot; he asked, &quot;if you knew you only had less than an 
hour to live?&quot; Usagi only looked at him, blinking. He continued. &quot;Would 
you spend it with those you love, apologizing for everything you&#39;ve done 
to wrong them and forgiving them for how they wronged you? Or would, 
perhaps, go out to do all the crazy stuff you didn&#39;t think you&#39;d do 
becuase you were too scared before? Would you find a way to make your 
name immortal, or slink into the shadows as if you never exsisted?&quot;

Usagi blinked again before looking out into the city as well. &quot;Do you 
think you&#39;re going to die tonight, Yung Hu?&quot; Yung Hu said nothing. Usagi 
continued. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen you this distraught before Yung Hu.&quot; She 
turned to him to study his face. &quot;You look as if you know something we 
don&#39;t and you&#39;re just dying to tell us. Do you know something?&quot;

He nodded slowly. &quot;Hai, but I can&#39;t tell you. After the battle with 
Rubeus, you&#39;ll know all of my secrets.&quot;

&quot;Why must I wait,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;What if something we need to know is one 
of your secrets?&quot;

&quot;Then history would change,&quot; Yung Hu said quietly.

&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Usagi asked, confused.

He shook his head. &quot;Nevermind.&quot; Yung Hu looked down at his watch, sighed 
and looked back up. &quot;We have fifteen minutes, we should go.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;Let me go and tell Mamo-chan-&quot;

&quot;Iie,&quot; YUng Hu said quietly. &quot;He has no part in this. Believe me,&quot; Yung 
Hu said, looking at Usagi.

She looked at him for a moment, nodded and yelled out her 
transformation. When Usagi and transformed into Sailor Moon, Yung Hu 
also changed. He was once again in his gargoyle form, his eyes sadder 
than ever.

&quot;Lets go, shall we,&quot; Sailor Moon said. Yung Hu stood there. He seemed to 
waiting for something.

&quot;Hu-chan!&quot; Cried a small, muffled voice. Yung Hu jumped from his postion 
from the railing, walked over to the closed roof door and opened it. 
Standing there was Chibi Usa. &quot;Please don&#39;t leave with out me!&quot;

&quot;Chibi Usa,&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;You can&#39;t go.&quot;

But to Sailor Moon&#39;s surprise, Yung Hu bent down and picked her up. 
Walking back over to Sailor Moon, Yung Hu said, &quot;She needs to go.&quot; He 
then wrapped his other arm around Sailor Moon before she could protest 
and stepped onto the railing, spread his wings and was air born in a 
matter of seconds.

Yung Hu flew over the city, the crisp night air nipping at their faces. 
In minutes, the trio was standing once again in front of Rei&#39;s temple, 
evidence of their battle still present.

As Yung Hu sat the girls down, Sailor Moon turned to him and asked, 
&quot;Will you be able to do this, Yung Hu? I know you must be tired from the 
battle.&quot;

&quot;I am tired, but I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; he replied. Sailor Moon wondered if it 
was just her imagination, or was Yung Hu&#39;s voice thicker than usual.

Yung Hu smiled at Chibi Usa when she wrapped her arms around his leg and 
hugged him. He gently patted her head and winked at her.

&quot;Welcome, Sailor Moon! Welcome Chibi Usa!&quot; Said a booming, ecohing 
voice. &quot;Welcome, beast!&quot;

Yung Hu growled as a bright flash engulfed him, Chibi Usa and Sailor 
Moon. He felt himself become lighter and lighter and until he felt his 
feet leave the ground. They were heading up towards the UFO.

Their surroundings vanished as the light became brighter, and when it 
subsided, they found temselves floating in a room inside of the UFO. For 
a few moments they stayed like that, floating in the air before gravity 
finally latched onto them and pulled them back to the ground which was 
at least ten feet below them.

&quot;Ow,&quot; Sailor Moon whined.

Chibi Usa cralwed over to Yung Hu who was sitting on his hunches, his 
ears twitching for the slightest sound.

Sailor Moon looked up and gasped when she saw her friends and the other 
three guardians in the far corner of the room, all imprisoned on their 
very own crystal cross. They all saw the trio and tried once again to 
strain against their restraints, but nothing worked.

&quot;Hang on guys,&quot; Sailor Moon called out as she ran toward them only to be 
knocked back by a negitave force that flickered with black lightening 
where she had tried to run thru.

&quot;You can not save them,&quot; came Rubeus&#39;s voice, ecohing off the vast 
walls. &quot;You cannot even save yourselves.&quot; He appeared finally, above 
them all, a smug smirk upon his face.

&quot;Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s rude to make your guests wait,&quot; Yung Hu roared 
lunging at Rubeus. Rubeus smirked and turned to face him and when Yung 
Hu reached him, Rubeus slammed a dagger thru Yung Hu&#39;s stomache. Yung Hu 
gasped as the pain over took his body and hell fell to the ground.

Rubeus floated down to the floor, casted the dagger aside, and knealed 
down next to Yung Hu. &quot;You have just been poisoned,&quot; Rubeus whispered 
into the tiger&#39;s ear. &quot;You&#39;ll be dead with in minutes.&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot; Cried Chibi Usa as she ran to cradel Yung Hu&#39;s head in her lap. 
Rubeus stood and backed away as the small child began to pet the 
warrior&#39;s blue fur, her tears falling down onto his face. &quot;Please don&#39;t 
die...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a monster,&quot; Sailor Moon said as she turned to face Rubeus. &quot;How 
can you kill someone with poison and just stand there and watch? Where&#39;s 
the antidote!?&quot;

Rubeus truend and laughed at Sailor Moon. &quot;To your first question, I do 
it so I can thourghly enjoy the person&#39;s death. I can laugh as their 
body seizes up and the finally die. I don&#39;t miss anything.&quot; He laughed 
once again when Yung Hu began to have a fit, a sort of seirzure. &quot;And to 
your second question, there is no antidote. Don&#39;t you hate that?&quot;

At that moment, Yung Hu&#39;s hand rose up, a green flickering light in his 
hand. It looked like a sort of green fire ball. He roared out in both 
anger and pain when he shot it out at Rubeus. Rubeus, who was still 
looking at Sailor Moon had no time to react so he had been hit head on 
with the fire ball, causing him to fly into a wall and hit it with a 
sickening crack. Yung Hu&#39;s hand then fell to the ground.

He was dead.</pre>
