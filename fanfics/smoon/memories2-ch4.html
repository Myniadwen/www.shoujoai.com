<h1>Memories (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/coconut.html">The Coconut Cyclone</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/memories2-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Note: Hey everyone, I hope you&#146;re enjoying this fic so far. What 
started out as peep induced madness has turned into something, in my 
humble opinion at least, pretty cool. Thanks to everyone who has 
commented on this fic, you guys are very encouraging. It&#146;s enough to 
make The Cyclone a little misty. *sniff*

Well, enough ego inflation, on with the show&#133;

------------------------------------------------------------ 

I look at the half-eaten sandwich in my hands and sigh. It isn&#146;t a 
culinary masterpiece at any rate yet, I know that I should finish it. 
But I just don&#146;t feel like eating. Honestly, I haven&#146;t felt like doing 
much of anything the past few days. All I&#146;ve been able to do is sit 
around my apartment and try to figure out how to get Setsuna to talk 
to me.

I haven&#146;t come up with anything. There&#146;s a reason we leave all the 
tactical planning to Ami, you know. I just don&#146;t know what to do. How 
do you get someone who can travel through time as she pleases to sit 
down for a talk when she doesn&#146;t want to even see you? 

I close my eyes and lean against the large tree I&#146;m currently seated 
under. I came to the park today in hopes of finding some answers while 
in my element. However, nature&#146;s not being too helpful. &quot;At least I&#146;m 
getting some fresh air.&quot;

&quot;Talking to the trees again Makoto?&quot; A husky voice chuckles.

I pop one eye open to glance at my guest. To someone who didn&#146;t know 
better, it would appear that a rather handsome young blond man was 
standing before me, I however, knew better. &quot;Hello, Haruka.&quot;

&quot;Hi Makoto,&quot; She gestures to the grass beside me. &quot;Mind if I have a 
seat?&quot;

&quot;Would it matter if I did?&quot;

She smiles and shakes her head. &quot;Not really.&quot; Then she sits down 
beside me.

I close my eye and steady myself. I have the distinct feeling that I&#146;m 
not going to like this conversation.

&quot;Why haven&#146;t you been answering your phone, odango and the others are 
worried about you?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#146;t answered my phone because I didn&#146;t want to talk to anyone.&quot;

Haruka raises an eyebrow at me. &quot;Really, or is it just that you didn&#146;t 
want to talk to the people that did call?&quot;

&quot;I just want to be left alone for a little while.&quot;

&quot;Running from things won&#146;t help the situation. Trust me, I&#146;m an expert 
at running.&quot;

&quot;I need to work this through on my own.&quot;

&quot;No, you need help Mako. You still haven&#146;t talked to anyone about your 
memories yet. You need to face the things you saw and accept your 
past. Stop being a coward.&quot;

My eyes snap open at that comment, I&#146;m barely able to keep my rising 
anger in check. All of the sudden something in me snaps, and before I 
know it words are flying from my lips. 

&quot;I&#146;ve accepted it. Gods, I&#146;ve accepted it. I&#146;m not the one who&#146;s 
running from her past Haruka. In fact I&#146;m not the one you should be 
giving this little lecture to either, so why don&#146;t you get out of my 
face already, before I make you get out of it.&quot;

A small smile spreads across Haruka&#146;s face. I half expect her to make 
another rude remark, but she surprises me instead. &quot;You&#146;re right. 
You&#146;re not the one I should be lecturing, but she has this nasty habit 
of running off to the gate every time Michiru and I try to talk to her 
about this.&quot;

&quot;If I&#146;m right then why are you here?&quot;

&quot;To make sure that you felt about her the way we though you did. 
Besides you were worrying the princess&#133;&quot; She answers and then mumbles 
something I can&#146;t entirely understand.

&quot;What was that last part?&quot;

She sighs and places a hand on my shoulder. &quot;And because I was worried 
about you too.&quot;

A very strange look must be crossing my face at the moment, because 
she begins to speak again. &quot;Look, I know we haven&#146;t been on the best 
of terms in this life.&quot;

&quot;Not on the best of terms? Well, let&#146;s see&#133;you let a youma almost kill 
me so you could see if I had a talisman. You called me and any other 
inner senshi weak whenever you got the chance. You constantly&#133;&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; She interrupts me before I can go any further. &quot;Maybe not 
on the best of terms was a bad choice of words.&quot;

I can&#146;t help but smile. &quot;It&#146;s okay, you were doing your duty. I did 
manage to punch you in the gut after all.&quot; 

She smiles back at me. &quot;That you did. Not just anyone can break 
through my defenses like that, you&#146;re quite the warrior Makoto.&quot;

I think my eyes are going to pop out of their sockets. Did Haruka just 
complement me on my fighting abilities? I put a hand to my heart 
dramatically. &quot;Quick the world is going to explode at any second, the 
great Sailor Uranus just acknowledged that an inner senshi can 
actually fight.&quot;

She rolls her eyes at me. &quot;Anyway, the point is we&#146;ve all remembered a 
lot about our past lives and one of the things I remember most is that 
we were friends then, good friends. I&#146;d like to be your friend again 
if you&#146;ll let me.&quot;

I meet her gaze and from the look in her eyes I can tell that&#146;s she&#146;s 
serious about this. &quot;I think I&#146;d like that Haruka. But if you ever 
call me a coward again...&quot;

***

Haruka and I sat under the tree for hours after that talking about the 
past. She&#146;s actually a good listener. It felt good to talk about 
things even if it wasn&#146;t with Setsuna

The sun was making it&#146;s way past the tree tops when she rose to leave. 
&quot;Sorry, to have to stop the drive down memory lane, but I promised 
Michi that I&#146;d take her out tonight and I need to get cleaned up 
before our date.&quot;

I nod. &quot;I really should get home too. I need to call the girls and let 
them know that I&#146;m still alive.&quot;

She offers her hand and helps me up. We say our good-byes and each go 
our separate ways. 

I&#146;ve only walked a few feet when I hear her call my name.

&quot;Oh Makoto, when you call Usagi will you check on Hotaru for me? She&#146;s 
spending the night over there and since Michiru and I are going out 
tonight I won&#146;t be able to do it myself.&quot;

&quot;Sure, Haruka.&quot;

She runs a hand through her hair and shakes her head. &quot;It&#146;s a shame 
really. Hotaru&#146;s going to be at Usagi&#146;s place and Michiru and I 
probably won&#146;t be home till tomorrow morning, I don&#146;t know what 
Setsuna is going to do in that big house all by herself tonight. Maybe 
someone should go and keep her company.&quot;

I smile and nod. Having Haruka as a friend is going to be a very good 
thing.

&quot;Maybe someone should.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Another note: I know you guys are like &quot;where&#146;s the action?&quot; Sorry, 
but I&#146;ve always wondered if Haruka and Makoto had ever worked out 
their differences over the events that happened in the S season. I&#146;ve 
read a couple of fics that explored the issue and I thought I&#146;d take a 
crack at it. Don&#146;t worry in next episode there&#146;ll be the showdown that 
you&#146;ve all been waiting for, at least I hope you&#146;re waiting for 
it&#133;you&#146;re waiting right? Right?
