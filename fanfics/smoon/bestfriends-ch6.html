Usagi dashed up the steps at the Hikawa Shrine, late as usual.  
This time, it was not really her fault.  After class, she&#39;d 
headed immediately to her meeting with Minako and Rei, but she&#39;d 
bumped into someone.

---
&quot;Usagi-chan, wait up! You trying to catch a bus or something?&quot; 

Usagi stopped and turned toward the familiar voice, &quot;Naru-chan! 
What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Oh, you know, I had the afternoon off from mom&#39;s store so I 
figured I&#39;d try to catch you after class, maybe we could go get 
some ice cream or something?&quot;  Naru smiled hopefully.

&quot;Oh, Naru-chan, I&#39;m so sorry, but I have a meeting I have to get 
to.&quot; Usagi frowned with disappointment, trying to recall the last 
occasion she&#39;d had time to just chat with her old best friend.  

That thought brought about equal amounts of nostalgia and regret.  
She really loved Naru, and they&#39;d been through so much together, 
but Naru could never really understand what it was like, to be a 
sailor senshi, a moon princess.  It seemed like all at once, 
she&#39;d met Mamoru and soon after Naru had hooked up with Umino 
and, ever since, they just hadn&#39;t spent the same amount of time 
together.  The fact that Naru was apprenticing in her mother&#39;s 
jewelry store, while Usagi struggled through college, made things 
even more difficult.

The dejection that washed over Naru&#39;s face made Usagi pause.  
&quot;Naru-chan, is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing, you go ahead to your meeting, I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; 
Naru replied, trying to put on a brave front.  

&quot;No, it&#39;s not nothing. I can tell.  There&#39;s something bothering 
you,&quot; Usagi stated. &quot;Come on, my meeting will just have to wait a 
bit.&quot;

&quot;Really, Usagi-chan, it&#39;s fine...&quot; Naru started, but her voice 
broke and tears began to form in her eyes.  

&quot;Oh, Naru-chan,&quot; Usagi sighed.  Reaching out, she took her 
friend&#39;s hand in her own and led her to a nearby park.  Usagi had 
long ago found a nice, secluded bench, perfect for private 
meetings.  Recalling some of those meetings (all had been with 
Mamoru) brought some perspiration to her forehead.  

Sitting down, Usagi drew Naru down next to her, still holding her 
hand. &quot;Tell me, Naru-chan, what&#39;s happened?  It&#39;s not something 
with...&quot;

At the mere hint of Umino&#39;s name, Naru broke out in a fresh bout 
of tears.  She wordlessly handed a moist piece of paper to Usagi.  
Scanning it quickly, Usagi soon realized it was a letter, 
from Umino to Naru.  The gist of it seemed to be that he&#39;d met 
someone at school.  Now, he thought that it wasn&#39;t fair for him 
to keep Naru from meeting someone of her own, so he believed that 
they should just be friends.  &#39;That jerk!&#39; Usagi thought. &#39;Naru 
loved him when he was still a googly-eyed nerd.  Now some college 
tart latches on to him, once he&#39;s matured, and he drops poor Naru 
like a hot potato!&#39;

Turning to the side, Usagi wrapped her arms around Naru and drew 
her into a comforting embrace.  For some time, she simply stroked 
her hair and murmured calming things into her ear.  In one way, 
Umino was right.  Naru could and would do better, but that didn&#39;t 
excuse his methods.  

After awhile, the sobbing subsided and Naru leaned back.  &quot;I must 
look like a mess,&quot; she laughed hesitantly. &quot;And I&#39;ve gotten make-
up all over your blouse.&quot;

&quot;You look fine, Naru-chan, and blouses can be washed,&quot; Usagi 
reassured her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry it happened that way.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve kind of been expecting it for awhile now,&quot; Naru said. 
&quot;Ever since he went off to school, we&#39;ve been drifting apart.  I 
guess, even when you know it&#39;s coming, it still hurts, huh?&quot;

Usagi nodded and squeezed her hands gently.

&quot;You&#39;re so lucky, Usagi-chan.  I know your Mamoru would never 
send you a letter like that.  How do you guys do it, with him 
gone so much?&quot;

Usagi sighed, &quot;We&#39;re meant for each other.  And I&#39;m sure you will 
find your prince, too, Naru-chan.&quot;

Naru laid her head on Usagi&#39;s shoulder and took a deep breath. &quot;I 
guess you&#39;re right.&quot;   For some time, they simply remained in 
that pose:  Naru leaning against Usagi, Usagi&#39;s arm draped over 
her shoulder.  

After the long, comfortable silence, Naru raised her eyes to 
Usagi&#39;s.  &quot;Usagi-chan, do you remember the time I slept over....&quot;  
She broke off, blushing furiously.  

The hopeful look in her friend&#39;s eyes was like a dagger stabbing 
into Usagi&#39;s heart.  Naru had slept over many times when they 
were in school, of course, but Usagi knew which occasion she 
meant. &quot;I remember, Naru-chan,&quot; she answered gently, carefully.

&quot;Do you ever wonder, well...&quot; Naru continued before embarrassment 
stopped her voice again.

Usagi shushed her and leaned down to kiss her forehead. 
&quot;Sometimes, Naru-chan, sometimes.  You know that I&#39;ll marry 
Mamoru one day, and you will be in my wedding party.  I hope 
you&#39;ll ask me to be in yours, when you wed.  I think you&#39;re just 
upset by that letter.&quot;

&quot;I know, you&#39;re right, Usagi-chan,&quot; Naru laughed, her 
embarrassment gone.  &quot;I&#39;ve thought of it, too, but it was just 
something that happened, once.  It was really nice, though, 
wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

Usagi blushed beet red.  &quot;Yes, Naru-chan, it really was.&quot;  
Slowly, she leaned down.  Naru raised her head off of Usagi&#39;s 
shoulder, tilting it to one side.  Their lips met, eyes closed, 
and they allowed themselves a brief visit back to that one 
special evening.  Usagi marveled at how soft her friend&#39;s lips 
were, how delicate her tongue as it danced with hers. 

Moments passed, that at the time seemed like ages, but in 
retrospect would seem all too brief.  Naru sighed and pulled 
away.  &quot;I love you, Usagi-chan.&quot;  Usagi beamed at her.  &quot;I love 
you, too, Naru-chan.&quot; 

Though they&#39;d drifted apart somewhat, the bonds between these two 
young women were still very strong.  Usagi knew that Naru would 
be all right now.  Naru understood that she had received 
something that she&#39;d desperately needed. Now she could move 
forward with her life.  After a bit longer, Naru reminded Usagi 
that she had a meeting to get to, and reassured her that she&#39;d be 
fine.  Sensing that it was true, Usagi got up to go and the two 
friends made tentative plans to go shopping together sometime 
soon.  

And so, it really wasn&#39;t Usagi&#39;s fault that she was late.  If 
hanyone, it was Umino&#39;s!

--------------
[evening]

&quot;Hellooooo, anyone home?&quot; Usagi called from the entryway as she 
stepped into Haruka and Michiru&#39;s apartment.  Though she&#39;d 
outgrown many of her old habits, she still saw an unlocked door 
more as an invitation than a barrier.  

The moon was just starting to rise in the sky, and she hoped that 
she was interrupting her friends&#39; dinner.  Her stomach rumbled 
its agreement with that desire.  The meeting with Rei and Minako 
had gone on a long time, and Rei never had enough goodies at her 
temple. 

It had been quite an afternoon, not even counting her little 
encounter with Naru.  Given where she was at the moment, Usagi 
tried to put that out of her mind.  She felt like one of those 
manga characters with a big sweatdrop on her forehead when she 
thought about it too much.  &#39;How ironic, given the topic of the 
big meeting&#39;, she considered.  Early on, the comparison of notes 
between Minako and Rei, backed up by Usagi&#39;s own observations 
(she&#39;d long had her suspicions about those two) had led them all 
to the same conclusion.  The bulk of the time, however, had been 
spent debating what to do about it.  

After a great deal of brainstorming, a few brawls with Rei, and a 
long digression concerning Minako&#39;s date with Shinozaki Kenjo, 
they had decided to split up.  Rei, for reasons Usagi still 
didn&#39;t quite understand, seemed concerned about the role that 
Urawa Ryu was to play in this.  Minako, for reasons Usagi 
understood all too well, felt that she should meet with Shinozaki 
again to discuss things with him.  Usagi, therefore, had been 
delegated with the most immediate and obvious mission, a 
diplomatic fact-finding junket to consult with the experts in the 
field at hand.

&quot;Haruka-san?  Michiru-san?&quot; she called again.   

&quot;Hey, meatball head,&quot; Haruka replied, stepping out of the 
kitchen. &quot;I thought I heard someone shouting out here.&quot;  She gave 
Usagi a wry look.  &quot;Did I leave our door open?  That isn&#39;t like 
me.&quot;

Usagi chuckled and blushed, closing the door behind her.  &quot;I&#39;m 
not interrupting your dinner, am I?&quot; she asked, trying not to 
look too eager.  

&quot;Michiru has rehearsal late tonight, so I was just popping 
something in the microwave for myself.&quot; Haruka waved Usagi 
forward and went back into the kitchen. &quot;I&#39;ve got some leftovers 
from last night.  Do you want some?&quot;

&quot;Well, if you insist,&quot; Usagi replied, going for &#39;demure 
politeness.&#39;  

Haruka just smiled and gestured to a chair. &quot;Have a seat, this 
won&#39;t take long.&quot;  After putting some dishes in the microwave and 
pushing a couple buttons, she turned and sat down across from 
Usagi.  &quot;So, to what do I owe the pleasure?&quot;  She raised an 
eyebrow and gave Usagi the once-over in her typically forward, 
flirty way.

Normally, Usagi would have laughed this off.  She enjoyed the 
little game that she and Haruka played. Haruka got to use 
flirting techniques and pick-up lines that would have otherwise 
atrophied, given her relationship with Michiru; Usagi got to play 
the innocent, naive little princess; and Michiru or Mamoru got to 
feign jealousy and exact revenge, usually much later and rather 
privately.  Fun for all!  Today, however, Usagi blushed deeply 
and couldn&#39;t meet Haruka&#39;s gaze.  Between Naru and her mission, 
she was understandably a bit more sensitive than usual in this 
particular area.

Haruka noticed immediately that Usagi wasn&#39;t playing along as 
usual.  She cocked her head to one side and considered the 
princess before her.  She obviously was not just dropping by to 
say &quot;Hi&quot;.  &quot;Something wrong, little rabbit? Did you and &#39;Mamo-
chan&#39; have a fight?&quot;

&quot;No, nothing like that,&quot; Usagi replied, re-focusing on why she 
was here.  &quot;I came by to ask you and Michiru for some advice.  We 
figured you guys were, well, you know, you&#39;d be a good source of 
information.&quot;

&quot;What do you want to ask?  Michiru won&#39;t be back for a while, but 
I&#39;ll help if I can,&quot; Haruka replied.  She could guess which 
particular topic Usagi (and whoever else made up that &#39;we&#39;) would 
see them as experts in, but couldn&#39;t even begin to hazard a guess 
as to where this was going.  

&quot;Well,&quot; Usagi began, trying to gather her courage, &quot;when you and 
Michiru first, you know, got together...did you both just 
know...that you were each...that way?  Or, did someone else help 
set you up?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a rather personal question, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Haruka 
asked calmly. &quot;I don&#39;t mind answering, but I think I deserve a 
little explanation.  Who wants to know, and why?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to know before I tell you why,&quot; Usagi answered 
carefully, &quot;but it&#39;s Rei, Minako, and I who need to know.&quot;

Haruka lifted one eyebrow and smirked in a way that brought a new 
rush of color to Usagi&#39;s cheeks and thin line of sweat to her 
brow.   Noting Usagi&#39;s reaction, Haruka laughed openly. &quot;Meatball 
head, you&#39;re not going to tell me that... the three of you?...!&quot;

&quot;No! Of course not!&quot; Usagi yelled.  

&quot;Why &#39;of course not&#39;?&quot; Haruka prodded. &quot;You&#39;re all very close, 
you&#39;re all pretty cute.  The way you and Rei bicker all the time, 
I always wondered what was going on there.&quot;

Usagi calmed down and looked at Haruka quite seriously.  &quot;Haruka-
san, you know that such a thing would never be possible between 
me and any of you.&quot;

Till that moment, Haruka hadn&#39;t realized that the thought that 
Usagi might have become intimate with Rei or Minako (or both!) 
was bothering her so much, but now she recognized the adrenaline 
rush through her system.  &#39;I&#39;m actually jealous.&#39;  Recovering her 
wits, she continued, &quot;Why not?  Because of &#39;Mamo-chan&#39;?&quot;

Usagi reached over and took Haruka&#39;s hand. &quot;Haruka-san...Haruka-
chan, even if I wanted to, which I do not, you know I could never 
let myself love any one of you like that.&quot;

Haruka waited, looking skeptical and puzzled.

With a sigh, Usagi explained. &quot;I love my Mamo-chan, Haruka-chan.  
None of you can compete with him, for one glaringly obvious 
reason, among others.  You _could_ compete with each other, 
though.  Each of you, in your own way, was born to love and 
protect me.  How would any of you react if I shared myself in 
that way with one of you in particular?&quot;

Haruka considered her words carefully, feeling no need to reply 
until she had thought through it all.  She herself loved Michiru 
more than life itself, and she knew Michiru felt the same way 
about her.  However, she also knew who it was that she could 
imagine coming between the two of them, the only other woman 
she&#39;d ever seriously considered in that way since she&#39;d met 
Michiru.  Recalling that immediate burst of jealousy she&#39;d just 
experienced, Haruka understood even more just how destructive it 
might have been if Usagi had ever shown that kind of preference 
for one of her senshi over the others.

&quot;You know something, meatball head,&quot; she said finally, with that 
characteristic smirk, &quot;you&#39;re actually a lot smarter than you 
look.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Usagi replied, before the words sank in. &quot;Hey! What 
does that mean!&quot;  She was just revving up her trademark wailing 
when the buzzer on the microwave forestalled her performance.

&quot;Saved by the bell,&quot; Haruka noted, moving to get the food and put 
it out on plates.  As she served the two of them, grabbing a 
couple of sodas out of the refrigerator as well, she gave Usagi a 
sly look. &quot;It&#39;s a shame for you, though.  You have no idea what 
you&#39;re missing.&quot;

Suddenly, Usagi dropped her fork and once again blushed deeply, 
unable to form any sort of reply.  Lights went on inside Haruka&#39;s 
mind.  &quot;You sly little wench! You _have_ messed around with a 
girl!&quot;

Usagi choked and grabbed the soda, drinking quickly, trying to 
recover.  &quot;Not really, well, just once, or twice.  Not with any 
of the others,&quot; she added desperately.

Haruka stifled a laugh and stared at Usagi, her penetrating gaze 
forcing the answer to her unspoken question.

&quot;It was a long time ago, before I even knew I was a sailor 
soldier,&quot; Usagi mumbled, &quot;My friend Naru. We were just, well, you 
know... curious.&quot;

Haruka smiled reassuringly, &quot;It&#39;s ok, meatball head, calm down. 
There&#39;s nothing too unusual about that, especially at that age, 
and I promise I won&#39;t tell anyone. Well, no one other than 
Michiru, but I tell her everything.  Your secret is safe with 
us.&quot;  She chuckled and shook her head with some amazement.  No 
matter what, her young princess never ceased to amaze her.  

&quot;Now that you know my secret,&quot; Usagi said between gulps of hot 
food and cold soda, &quot;are you going to answer my question?&quot;

Haruka had almost forgotten it in all of the turmoil, but now she 
paused to consider her reply. &quot;We were introduced by a mutual 
friend, but not &#39;set up&#39; in that way.  We both figured out how 
the other felt, but it took some time.  She knew how she felt 
before I did, and I couldn&#39;t bring myself to believe she could 
think of me in the same way I thought of her.  Eventually, we 
sorted it out.&quot;  Haruka grinned fondly, recalling those early 
days, when she&#39;d discovered her destiny.  &#39;I suppose my true 
destiny was to be Sailor Uranus and help save the world,&#39; she 
considered, &#39;but it always feels like my real destiny is to have 
my Michiru by my side, forever.&#39;

Usagi sighed, both because her plate was now empty and because 
that wasn&#39;t the answer she&#39;d been hoping for.  Somehow, she, Rei, 
and Minako had hoped that there would be some sort of super-
secret method that lesbians used to identify each other, that 
they could spring on Ami and Makoto.  A silly idea, she knew, but 
it certainly would have made things easier.  

&quot;Now, you owe me an answer, rabbit,&quot; Haruka reminded her. &quot;Why do 
you want to know?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s kind of a long story, but basically, we think that 
Ami and Makoto are secretly in love with each other, but that 
neither of them realizes it, and we&#39;re afraid that they will 
never figure it out, and we think they&#39;d be so cute together and 
so happy, and we want to help them, and Minako is working with 
Makoto&#39;s friend Kenjo, but I think she&#39;s mainly doing that 
because she has a secret crush on him (they went out on a date 
and from what I saw it was going very well, but Minako was mean 
and made me stop spying on them) and Rei thinks that Ami&#39;s friend 
Ryu is up to no good, but she really doesn&#39;t know why, so she&#39;s 
trying to keep an eye on him, and I said &#39;Why don&#39;t we ask Haruka 
and Michiru for advice&#39;, you know because you guys are lesbians 
so you might have some inside information, and so we all agreed 
that I should come over here and....&quot;

&quot;Take a breath, please!&quot; Haruka pleaded, her head spinning, as 
she tried to parse what Usagi had just babbled at her.  &quot;You and 
Rei and Minako think that Ami and Makoto have feelings for each 
other?&quot;

&quot;Yes, you see...&quot; Usagi began, stopping when Haruka raised her 
palm.

&quot;And you all want to help, because you&#39;re worried that they won&#39;t 
be able to figure things out and deal with them on their own?&quot;

&quot;Yes, we were...&quot; Again, the palm.

&quot;I see,&quot; Haruka nodded. Taking a deep breath herself, she stood 
up and cleared the table.  Usagi, nervously biting her nails, 
waited. 

&quot;You should just leave them alone,&quot; Haruka finally advised. &quot;If 
they really do feel that way about each other, then they need to 
figure it out on their own.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Wait. Listen,&quot; Haruka demanded. &quot;If you guys try to interfere, 
at best, you are denying them the chance to realize things for 
themselves, maybe even taking away all the wonderful moments that 
come just before, or early on in, a romance.  At worst, you could 
scare one or the other away from her true feelings.  Do you 
understand?&quot;

Usagi silently nodded her head, feeling suddenly ashamed.

Haruka gently chucked her on the shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t feel bad, 
little rabbit. It says a lot about how much you guys love your 
friends that you are being so supportive and trying to help.&quot;

Usagi smiled.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you curious to know why we think they feel 
that way about each other?&quot; she asked.

Haruka laughed again. &quot;Michiru and I have suspected as much for a 
long time now.  I&#39;m surprised it took you all this long to 
notice, but I guess you see some things more clearly from a 
distance.  Let them be and things will sort themselves out.&quot;

Standing up, Usagi bowed, thanking Haruka for the meal and the 
advice.  &quot;Give my regards to Michiru-san, please,&quot; she said as 
she got ready to leave. 

&quot;I will.&quot;  Haruka got the door for her friend.  Once again, she 
very obviously looked her over from bottom to top. &quot;Remember, if 
you ever decide to &#39;experiment&#39; again, you know where I live. I&#39;m 
sure Michiru wouldn&#39;t mind too much.&quot;

This time, Usagi was able to play along. Lowering her eyes 
demurely, she murmured, &quot;Haruka-san, you flatter me. As tempting 
as your invitation is, though, I could never do such a thing to 
dear Michiru-san.&quot;  She laid one hand delicately on her chest and 
raised her gaze to meet her friend&#39;s, suppressing a good-natured 
laugh.  &quot;Besides,&quot; she added with a grin, &quot;she would too mind, 
and you know it!&quot; 

Haruka reached out and tousled her hair, &quot;Take care, meatball 
head, and don&#39;t be such a stranger.&quot;

&quot;Bye, Haruka-san!&quot; she called as she headed for the elevator.  It 
had been an odd day indeed, but Usagi felt much more confident 
about things.  Heck, maybe Ami and Makoto had already figured 
things out.   With happy thoughts about her friends in mind, she 
returned home.  She couldn&#39;t wait to email Mamo-chan about all of 
this.  &#39;Well,&#39; she admitted to herself with another blush, &#39;most 
of it, anyway.&#39;
