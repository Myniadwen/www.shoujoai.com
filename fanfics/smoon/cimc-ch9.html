<h1>Come into My Chamber (part 9 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>It was nothing like she had expected.  The drug like euphoria that 
flooded her mind when she first tasted the blood of the detective was 
almost orgasmic in its magnitude; she had never experienced such an 
unbelievable feeling before in all of her centuries of life.  She felt 
her knees buckle slightly, and she was so wrapped up in the incredible 
feeling, that she barely noticed the slight struggles of the woman in 
her arms stop.  A slight part of her mind made her cease; and she backed 
away from the detective.  It had felt like forever, but in reality, she 
had not taken enough to kill.

She wondered briefly, if that was what Demando felt when he took her 
that day in the woods.  Was it truly that amazing to bind with another 
soul in such a way; if only for a moment?

She closed her eyes and sat on  the bed, until she heard slight noises 
coming from Rei.

&quot;Miss Hino?&quot; She ran to the woman&#146;s side, but the detective moved away 
into a corner of the ornate room, shaking violently with silent sobs.  
Serenity bit her lip and looked at the carpet.
 
&quot;I am sorry...Rei, you must understand&#151;&quot; Rei cut her off.  

&quot;Sorry...&quot; Rei repeated quietly.
 
She sounded tired, and oddly defeated.  Serenity did not like this 
sudden, frightening change in demeanor.  Choosing a life mate was the 
most important thing in the world to her people.  Shouldn&#146;t Rei&#146;s heart 
be beating in tune with hers?  What had she done wrong?  She performed 
the bonding flawlessly; it should have worked.  Rei shouldn&#146;t be afraid 
of her, she shouldn&#146;t be crying, it was preposterous.  Serenity felt a 
flicker of panic.
 
&quot;You&#146;re afraid of me,&quot; she stated dully.  Rei tried to laugh, but it 
came out as a slight whimper.

&quot;I wonder why?  Jesus, you are perceptive.  Just kill me; get it over 
with.  I doubt I&#146;ll get out of this place alive anyway.&quot;

&quot;That isn&#146;t true,&quot; Serenity interjected.  &quot;I&#146;ll protect you; they won&#146;t 
hurt you, I promise!&quot;  

&quot;Protect...you don&#146;t want to protect me.  You want me to be your little 
slave, like Demando made you,&quot; her voice was rising, but she didn&#146;t 
really care anymore.  Maybe if she got the vampire angry enough, she 
would kill her.  Rei wasn&#146;t sure she would be able to live like a normal 
person after she was through with this.
 
Serenity shook her head.

&quot;I would...never treat you like he...please, just try to listen.  
I...don&#146;t want you to hate me.&quot;

&quot;Shut up...&quot; Rei hissed. &quot;You&#146;re so na&iuml;ve; why are you acting like such 
a child?!  You&#146;ve lived long enough, haven&#146;t you learned anything?&quot;  
Serenity shrunk back.

&quot;It&#146;s not supposed to be like this...when Demando...&quot;

&quot;When Demando tore your throat open in the woods and ripped your 
innocence away from you, you just let him, huh?  You didn&#146;t fight, you 
didn&#146;t refuse?!  You just followed him around like a lost lamb for 
centuries until you finally got enough sense to run away?!  Is that what 
you did?!  So you wanted him to do that; you wanted to lose your 
choices; your life?  IS THAT WHY YOU RAN?&quot;

&quot;Be quiet!  You and  I...we are together now, do you understand?&quot;  Rei 
looked up at her in pity.

&quot;You don&#146;t even know what love really is...you don&#146;t know what it means, 
or what it represents.&quot;

Serenity&#146;s eyes widened, and she held her head.

&quot;That isn&#146;t...&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.  It&#146;s not your fault...you were just too young to 
understand...Demando didn&#146;t love; he obsessed.  That isn&#146;t what love is; 
that isn&#146;t what it means.  It&#146;s not like that at all.  Not at all...I&#146;m 
so sorry...&quot;
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
It was silent in Setsuna&#146;s chambers, as she and Kazuki were so deeply 
connected, that they did not need to speak to each other to communicate.  
Setsuna lazily threaded her long, delicate fingers through Kazuki&#146;s 
glossy raven black hair and sighed, leaning against the other woman.
 
After a while, she stopped the mechanical action, and sighed sadly.
 
&quot;I missed you too.  It&#146;s a shame...&quot; she took a deep breath and let it 
out slowly, &quot;that this had to be happening for us to be together again.  
Kazuki looked embarrassed suddenly.
 
&quot;I apologize.&quot;

Setsuna waved her hand, dismissing the apology.

&quot;All that matters is right now.  We should...prepare.  I suppose the 
others can feel him in the air by now too.&quot;  Kazuki frowned.

&quot;Milady will be displeased.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps so, but rules state she must return.  It is...a serious offense 
to abandon one&#146;s mate, no matter how deplorable they are.&quot;

&quot;We should fight him.&quot;

&quot;And die?  We will wait.  Do not be so brash.&quot;  Kazuki huffed angrily.

&quot;Going quietly only to rot away.&quot;

&quot;I never said wait forever.  I am patient; but even I have limits.  We 
just have to wait.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;The Queen has chosen a new mate.  This changes things.  If the Queen 
has a new mate, then she is free from Demando, correct?&quot;

&quot;Correct.  What is the problem then?&quot;

&quot;Her partner has not accepted her.  One half doesn&#146;t make a whole.&quot;

&quot;Terrific.&quot;  Setsuna ignored the sarcasm.

&quot;Do not worry; it will not take very long.  All we need is a little 
help.  By any chance, does that dippy little girl still work for you?&quot;

&quot;Mitsuki?  Yes...oh...how am I going to explain...?&quot;

&quot;You won&#146;t have to explain a thing.  The girl&#146;s knowledge of the 
paranormal is less than stellar.  Simply tell her to open the shop on 
her own on Monday, and wait for a certain detective to come snooping 
around.&quot;

&quot;You...can&#146;t be serious.  That woman is the Queen&#146;s...?&quot;

&quot;Indeed.  The detective will try to find the Queen; the pull will be too 
strong.&quot;

&quot;Is she...has she been changed?&quot;

&quot;I...do not feel anything of the sort.  It is odd.&quot;

&quot;Interesting.  I hope it isn&#146;t a bad omen.&quot;

&quot;Neither do I.&quot; 

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Minako watched the doctor until she couldn&#146;t see her anymore, and stared 
up at the sky.  It was silly, really, to be thinking about such 
a...problem right now, she could feel Demando getting closer, and they 
wouldn&#146;t be able to return to this place after he arrived and dragged 
them all off to whatever hell he had planned for them.  Minako didn&#146;t 
doubt that he would punish them as a whole, instead of simply the Queen.  
She clenched her fist.  Although she would...miss things, it was a small 
price to pay if he decided to stay in this place with his followers, 
only God knew what horrors they would cause.

Sighing, she decided not to dwell on this.  He would call on Serenity 
first, and she would reluctantly follow, as would they.  It was the way 
things had to be.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
&quot;Where...did she go?&quot;

Mitsuki had awakened to the impatient barks of her dog, and frowned when 
she realized Minako was no where to be seen.

&quot;How could she have left so quietly?  I didn&#146;t hear a thing.  The sun 
hasn&#146;t even risen yet.&quot;  She frowned and rubbed her eyes.

&quot;Well...I...hope she&#146;ll be fine.&quot;  Her phone rang suddenly, and she 
rolled off the couch, catching it before it stopped.

&quot;Hello?&quot;  

&quot;Mitsuki. Good evening.&quot;

&quot;Kazuki...I mean, um...why are you calling so late?&quot;

&quot;I apologize.&quot; Mitsuki heard a slight shuffle on the other side of the 
phone. &quot;I was err...preoccupied earlier, and um, well, err...&quot;

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m fine.&quot; Kazuki coughed and Mitsuki heard a sharp yelp and a thump.

&quot;Umm...are you fighting someone?&quot;

Kazuki chuckled, and Mitsuki repressed a shiver.  She had never heard 
her employer laugh before.

&quot;You could...say that. Listen very carefully.  I need you to open the 
shop tomorrow for me.  I will be taking a short leave of sorts.  You 
will receive a visit from a woman looking for me.  Tell her that I am 
with Serenity.  Now, this next part is very important.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;  Mitsuki wanted to ask who Serenity was, but she held her tongue.

&quot;In the back of the store, there is a room. Hit the wall three times 
next to the door of this room, and the door will open.  In the center of 
this room is a book with a key.  Give the detective the key, but read 
the book with her, understand?  I want you to accompany her.&quot;

&quot;Accompany her where?&quot;  This had to be the most confusing conversation 
Mitsuki had ever had.

&quot;That isn&#146;t important.  You&#146;ll find out when you read the book.  Take 
care, dear girl.  You were a bit silly, but Setsuna always liked you, so 
I suppose I liked you too.&quot;

&quot;Who? What? Kazuki, are you okay?&quot;

Mitsuki received a dial tone in return.

&quot;Do people want to worry me to death or something?&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Serenity shook slightly, clinging to Rei as she whispered soft apologies 
in her ear.  She had never felt so comforted by another person before.  
She couldn&#146;t let Demando get to her, ever.  He would be outraged if he 
knew she had chosen another mate, especially a woman.  She could feel 
him grow closer; it would only be a matter of time before he arrived.

&quot;Rei...You must listen to me.  You have to leave, now.&quot; Rei looked 
confused.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong now?&quot;

&quot;I...can&#146;t tell you...you have to go, now.&quot;

Rei couldn&#146;t ever explain what happened next, no matter how many times 
she tried to recount it in her mind.  Others would try to get her to 
remember, but it would never, ever be clear in her mind.  The only thing 
she would recall were the sounds of a slight scuffle, a shrill scream, 
and then nothing at all.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Please...return to me. Please find a way.
