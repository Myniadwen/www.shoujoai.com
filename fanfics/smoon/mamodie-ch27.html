<a href="../smoon/mamodie-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>---Prologue---

In 1996, a group of Senshi was sent to prison and their show was 
cancelled by a Japanese court for a crime they didn&#39;t commit. They 
promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Tokyo 
underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as 
soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no-one else can help, and 
if you can find them, maybe you can hire...

---Omake Twenty-Seven: The S-Team---

Out in a secluded area in the woods, Minako and Usagi had just finished 
gathering the sticks and twigs for the campfire. Usagi took two sticks 
and began to rub then together, trying to get a fire going, when Minako 
reached into her pocket and pulled out a lighter.

&quot;Whoa,&quot; Usagi said, &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;

&quot;What, are you serious?&quot; the fellow blonde asked as she waved the 
lighter in the air, &quot;You&#39;d be surprised what I can get with this face. 
Men can&#39;t say no to me.&quot;

Just then a groan was heard coming out of the black van they always 
traveled in. Slowly, a raven-haired figure emerged, her knees buckling 
underneath her and her back stooped over as she struggled to make her 
way over to her companions.

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; Usagi asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong? You look terrible.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all these damn gold chains, you crazy fool!&quot; Rei said angrily as 
she fought to keep her balance, almost the entire top half of her body 
obscured by a plethora of large gold necklaces, &quot;I pity the fool who 
wrote this stupid thing; I can barely walk!&quot;

&quot;Hey, wait a sec,&quot; Minako broke in, &quot;If you&#39;re supposed to be B.A. in 
this omake, shouldn&#39;t you be sporting a Mohawk?&quot;

Usagi quickly fished into her pocket, and came out with a sock on her 
hand, &quot;If you&#39;d like, me and my friend sock can cut your hair,&quot; she 
offered with a smile.

&quot;Shut up you crazy fool!&quot; Rei answered, &quot;Nobody gonna cut my trademark 
dark locks, I... I...&quot; it was at that point that the raven-haired beauty 
fell backwards under the weight of all her gold jewelry.

Usagi made a face and addressed the sock on her hand, &quot;I think that big 
angry girl is getting worse,&quot; she said.

Just then they were all joined by their cigar-smoking leader, Chiba 
Mamoru. He stepped over the prostrate form of Rei as he pulled out the 
cash from their last job, &quot;I love when a plan comes together,&quot; he said 
as he passed the loot out. Minako made a face.

&quot;This is it?&quot; she asked incredulously.

&quot;Well what do you expect?&quot; Mamoru asked, &quot;We were paid in used cans and 
bottles. That&#39;s the most I could get for them.&quot;

&quot;I pity the fool that only gives back five cents a can!&quot; Rei shouted 
from where she was lying.

&quot;So,&quot; Usagi asked, &quot;Any new jobs?&quot;

Mamoru&#39;s lips curled up into a smile, &quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask,&quot; he 
quipped, &quot;As a matter of fact, there are some old friends of ours in 
trouble...&quot;

---Later---

&quot;So, you see,&quot; Haruka continued, her countenance downcast, &quot;When we 
Outers signed our contracts, we didn&#39;t know anything about having an 
agent or lawyer present, nor had we any idea about residuals.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve been translated into multiple languages,&quot; Michiru said tearfully 
as Haruka held her hand comfortingly, &quot;The old episodes have made us all 
famous worldwide, and we&#39;ve... We&#39;ve never received pay for any of the 
reruns.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Mamoru said as Usagi and Minako helped Rei into the room, a 
hand under each of her arms to help support the weight of her gold 
chains, &quot;Does Setsuna or Hotaru know about the financial straights you 
all are now in?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Haruka answered, &quot;We&#39;ve been able to shelter them from the truth, 
but now...&quot;

&quot;Now they&#39;re going to repossess Haruka&#39;s convertible,&quot; Michiru said as 
Haruka made a face like somebody was killing her closest family member.

&quot;And you want us to stop the repo man?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Usagi said enthusiastically as she took her hand out from 
under Rei&#39;s arm to strike a dramatic pose, &quot;Because as the S-Team we are 
sworn to protect and...&quot;

Thump!

Usagi and the others in the Outers mansion looked down to see the 
increasingly cranky Rei once again lying on the floor under the weight 
of her gold chains.

&quot;Don&#39;t just stand there gaping you crazy fools!&quot; the raven haired woman 
shouted as she flopped around on the floor like a fish, &quot;Help me up 
already!&quot;

As Haruka joined Minako and Usagi in helping Rei back up, Mamoru turned 
to Michiru.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; he said, flashing a smile as he took another puff on his 
cigar, &quot;I have a plan...&quot;

---One Montage Scene Where The S-Team Turns Their Black Van Into A Tank 
Later---

&quot;This really bites,&quot; the brunette behind the wheel of the repo truck 
groused, &quot;I mean, it&#39;s bad enough you and I had to get this gig when the 
show was cancelled, but repossessing Haruka&#39;s convertible?&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean Mako-chan,&quot; Ami said, &quot;But hey, look on the bright 
side; five hundred years from now in Crystal Tokyo we&#39;ll all look back 
on this and... What in the hell... Mako...&quot;

&quot;I see it Ami-chan, but I don&#39;t believe it.&quot;

------

As Ami and Makoto were coming around the block onto the street where the 
Outers mansion was, on the other end of the street was the black S-Team 
van which was now sporting a rocket launcher up on its roof.

&quot;Listen,&quot; Mamoru said as he stood on the roof with Rei (who was now 
using a walker for support), Rei and I are going to aim this ACME rocket 
at the repo truck, blowing it to Kingdom Come. Usagi, you&#39;ve got the 
launch controls. When I say &#39;okay,&#39; you launch the rocket and...&quot; before 
Mamoru could finish giving his instructions, the walker Rei was leaning 
on collapsed under the weight of her gold chains, and she bumped into 
the leader of the S-Team on the way down. Mamoru stumbled forward and 
fell hard, straddling the large rocket.

&quot;Cheap-ass walker!&quot; Rei shouted angrily, &quot;I pity the fool that 
manufactured it!&quot;

&quot;Mamoru!&quot; Minako cried out as the young man slowly sat up on the rocket, 
&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

The S-Team leader nodded as he took a puff on his cigar, &quot;I&#39;m okay I 
guess, I...&quot;

Usagi, hearing her leader say &quot;okay,&quot; immediately pressed the launch 
button.

&quot;Wha... No, I didn&#39;t mean... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&quot; Mamoru 
screamed as he was launched into the air atop the ACME missile. Not 
having had time to actually aim it properly it did not, in fact, hit the 
repo truck.

It did, however, hit Haruka&#39;s convertible.

-KA-THOOM!-

A stunned Haruka and Michiru came out of their house to look on in 
horror at the burning, twisted metal remains of the sandy-blonde&#39;s &#39;94 
convertible. The two were soon joined by Makoto and Ami who&#39;d parked 
their repo truck nearby, and Minako and Usagi, who were helping Rei 
over.

&quot;My... My car...&quot; Haruka whimpered as the normally tough and 
self-assured tomboy&#39;s lower lip began to quiver.

&quot;Um...&quot; Usagi said sheepishly, &quot;We successfully kept them from 
repossessing your car, so if you&#39;re ready to pay now, we&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Pay you?&quot; Haruka asked in disbelief, &quot;You blew up my fucking 
convertible you stupid...&quot;

Just then Setsuna and Hotaru pulled up in the Time Senshi&#39;s car. &quot;Great 
news!&quot; Setsuna said as she and Hotaru ran out of the car, &quot;Due to new 
DNA evidence Usagi and the others have been cleared of the false charges 
lodged against them, and we&#39;re all going to be staring in new episodes 
of Sailor Moon. We&#39;ll be getting residuals this time too, and... Haruka, 
what the fuck happened to your car?&quot;

&quot;N... New episodes?&quot; Haruka asked, her voice sounding distant and 
disconnected.

&quot;Dear,&quot; Michiru said soothingly, &quot;We&#39;ve got a show again. Our financial 
problems are over.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Minako quickly added, &quot;And now, you can buy yourself a brand new 
convertible.&quot;

Haruka looked at the blonde who&#39;d just spoken, and then turned back to 
the smoldering wreck in her driveway.

&quot;Well,&quot; she finally said, &quot;I suppose it was time to get a new one. The 
thing was a gas guzzler,&quot; she said as she shrugged her shoulders.

Usagi meanwhile had turned to Rei and frowned, &quot;Here,&quot; she said as she 
began undoing the dark-haired woman&#39;s gold chains, causing a small pile 
to gather at her feet. Finally, she stopped when there was only three 
chains around her neck, &quot;There. This way, you can have your gold chains 
and still walk around on your own.&quot;

Rei&#39;s face lit up into a smile, &quot;Wow,&quot; she said, &quot;How can I ever thank 
you?&quot;

Usagi smiled as she reached over and stroked Rei&#39;s cheek, &quot;I think I 
know a way,&quot; she purred seductively.

Rei smiled back as she took the blonde into her arms, &quot;Shut up and kiss 
me you crazy fool!&quot; she ordered as she pressed her lips to Usagi&#39;s.</pre>
