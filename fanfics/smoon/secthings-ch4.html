<h1>Secrets and Things Not Well Hidden (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crawlspace.html">Crawlspace</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/secthings-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Serena sprinted across the path and ducked behind a tree.   Peeking 
around the tree trunk, she spotted her quarry, who still hadn&#146;t  seen 
her after almost an hour of her following them.  Once again,  Serena 
congratulated herself on her stealth and cunning as she prepared  to 
follow Amara and Michelle farther into the park. 	

Last weekend when she&#146;d gone to see Amy, the girl had told her to  
just leave it alone.  Serena had tried, she really had.  But her  
curiosity was getting the better of her. 	

&#145;Curiosity killed the cat,&#146; she could hear Mina saying.  Serena  
thought it was more likely the cat went crazy from not having its  
curiosity sated. 	

The park was all but deserted this afternoon, so keeping up with  
Amara and Michelle wasn&#146;t difficult.  It had also been easy to stay on 
their tails through the shopping district, even if it had gotten a bit  
boring waiting for Michelle to finish trying on all those clothes.   
Serena couldn&#146;t count the number of bags and boxes that had been left  
in Amara&#146;s car before the two had started walking towards the park. 	

Serena crouched down behind a bush, then raised her head just  enough 
to spy over the top. 	

Michelle was staring right at her. 	

Serena &#145;eeped&#146; and fell backwards.  A hand came down on her  shoulder 
and pulled her up, turning her so she could see who was behind  her. 	

&#147;Why are you following us?&#148; demanded Amara. 	

Serena tried to answer, but nothing more than a few stuttered  
syllables emerged. 	

Amara released the smaller girl with a light shove.  &#147;Go home,  
meatball head.  If I catch you following us again, I won&#146;t let you off 
so easy.&#148; 	

Amara turned to walk away just as Serena found her voice.  &#147;I  know 
about you,&#148; she blurted out. 	

The older girl stopped, but didn&#146;t turn around.  Sounding as if  she 
were talking to a slow child, she said, &#147;I was there moonface,  
remember?  The parking garage, the cathedral.  We were all there and 
we  all know.&#148; 	

&#147;No.  I mean about you and Michelle.  I know.&#148; 	

That made Amara turn around.  Serena shrank back from the girl&#146;s  cold 
glare. 	

&#147;I don&#146;t know what you think you know &#150;&#147; 	

&#147;Amara.&#148;  Michelle&#146;s tone was cautionary as she addressed her  
partner. 

Serena looked back and forth between the two girls.  Their eyes  had 
locked, and she could sense the silent communication even if she  
couldn&#146;t decipher it. 	

Amara nodded, then refocused on Serena.  &#147;Come on,&#148; she said as  she 
grabbed Serena&#146;s arm. 	

The three girls left the park, Serena being more or less drug  along 
by Amara.  She didn&#146;t question where they were going until she  was 
stuffed in the back seat of Amara&#146;s car with the bags and boxes  that 
wouldn&#146;t fit in the trunk.  Again Amara&#146;s glare was able to  silence 
her.  Serena shrank back against the car seat. 	

The ride to the apartment building was silent.  No words were  spoken 
as the car was parked or during the elevator ride. 	

Amara unlocked the door to the apartment she shared with Michelle.   
&#147;In here,&#148; she said as she led Serena into the sitting room.  &#147;Sit 
where you want.&#148; 	

Serena chose to perch on the edge of the couch, hands folded in  her 
lap and looking like a schoolgirl about to be scolded by an angry  
teacher. 	

Michelle sat in a chair across from Serena.  Amara stood to the  side 
of the chair, her body tense. 	

&#147;You said you know about us,&#148; began Michelle.  &#147;Could you  elaborate 
on that a bit, please?&#148; 	

Serena&#146;s hands twisted nervously in her lap.  &#147;Well, you see, I  found 
this picture in my brother&#146;s magazine of a race and you two, well,  
you were there and you were kissing.  Only it wasn&#146;t the kind of kiss  
you give your cousin.  It was more like the way I want Darien to kiss  
me and then Raye said it was obvious that Amara was gay even though I  
didn&#146;t think so, but she didn&#146;t say anything about Michelle, so I 
asked  Amy, but she said it wasn&#146;t any of our business even though she 
already  knew and &#150;&#147; 	

Serena paused mid-ramble to take a breath.  Her mouth opened  again to 
continue. 	

&#147;Just how many people have you told?&#148; interrupted Amara. 	

&#147;I tried to tell Raye, but she misunderstood.  And Amy already  knew, 
so I didn&#146;t really tell her.&#148; 	

&#147;I wondered why Amy stopped coming by the sports center,&#148; said  
Michelle sadly.  &#147;I missed our races.  She was the only one who could  
give me a real challenge.&#148; 	

Amara started to say something, but Michelle&#146;s hand on hers  stopped 
her.  She looked down to the other girl, clearly annoyed at  being 
interrupted. 	

&#147;At this point,&#148; said Michelle calmly to her partner, &#147;we have  
nothing left to lose.  Tell her the truth, *Haruka.*&#148; 	

Serena stared curiously at them as the older blonde visibly  deflated.  
The girl relaxed against the side of the chair and focused  back on 
Serena. 	

&#147;To begin with,&#148; began Haruka, &#147;we aren&#146;t cousins.  That was just  
part of the disguise.  Just like our names.  Mine is really Haruka  
Tenoh.  Michelle&#146;s is Michiru Kaioh.&#148; 	

Serena turned this information over in her head for several  minutes.  
Finally she asked, &#147;Why didn&#146;t you just tell us that in the  
beginning?  Why lie about it?&#148; 	

&#147;It&#146;s not lying,&#148; answered Haruka.  &#147;It&#146;s just&#133; just&#133;&#148; 	

&#147;Easier,&#148; supplied Michiru when the other girl couldn&#146;t seem to  find 
a word.  &#147;It was easier to explain two girls living together the  way 
we are by saying we were related.  This way we could enroll in  school 
and no one would think much about it or ask any uncomfortable  
questions.&#148; 	

&#147;It was the same with our names,&#148; continued Haruka.  First of all,  
Michiru&#146;s name is too well known.&#148;       

&#147;And yours isn&#146;t?&#148; smiled Michiru.       

&#147;No one outside the circuit would recognize me.  But say Michiru Kaioh 
and people immediately start talking about this painting or that  
piece of music.  Besides that, we also thought it would be easier to  
use names that were common to the people in this region,&#148; explained  
Haruka. 

Serena&#146;s forehead wrinkled in confusion.  &#147;You thought &#145;Amara&#146;  was 
simpler or more common than &#145;Haruka&#146;?&#148; 	

Michiru giggled and Haruka frowned.  &#147;No, I thought Alexandra  would 
be.  But the idiot who made up our ID&#146;s fouled up.  He gave me  some 
stupid line about how people would inevitably call me &#145;Alex&#146; and  how 
it would cause gender confusion yadda, yadda, yadda.  He&#146;s just  lucky 
we were rushing as much as we were to get out here.  Otherwise&#133;&#148; 	

&#147;I still don&#146;t get it.  Why did you think you had to lie?  We  would 
have understood.&#148; 	

&#147;We couldn&#146;t be sure that everyone would, though,&#148; answered  Michiru.  
&#147;Try and understand it from our point of view.  I knew from  the 
moment I saw Haruka that I wanted more than just friendship from  her.  
It was a normal thing for me, but I had some friends who could  never 
get used to the idea of me being like that.  There are a lot of  
people who don&#146;t approve.  When we came here we wanted to avoid that  
sort of attention and fulfill the mission.  That was it.&#148;       

&#147;The mission,&#148; said Serena solemnly. 	

&#147;The mission,&#148; repeated Haruka.  &#147;And that hasn&#146;t changed.  We&#146;ll  
still proceed the way we think we have to.  Even if you try to hold  
this over our heads in some way.&#148; 	

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t,&#148; protested Serena. 	

&#147;You say that now,&#148; said Haruka.  She stood straight once again.   
&#147;We&#146;ve said all we need to for now.  Nothing&#146;s changed, odango.   
Remember that.&#148;         

Serena stood and followed Haruka and Michiru to the door.       

Before Haruka could close the door, Michiru asked quietly, &#147;How  did 
Amy know?  You said you didn&#146;t have to tell her.&#148; 	

Serena smiled at the girl and shrugged.  &#147;She said subtly wasn&#146;t  your 
strong point.  She saw something in all those touches and whispers  
that I missed, I guess.  Kinda like you were saying one thing and 
doing  another.&#148; 	

Michiru nodded back in understanding. 	

Before anything further could be said, Haruka closed the door.   From 
her place in the hall, Serena heard the deadbolt click into place. 	

Serena put her hands behind her head and stretched her arms out  with 
a sigh.  &#147;So unnecessary,&#148; she said quietly to herself as she  walked 
towards the elevator.  &#147;We would have understood.&#148;   	

----------------------------------------------------------------

Inside the apartment, Michiru put her arms around Haruka&#146;s waist  and 
rested her head on the blonde&#146;s chest.  &#147;Haruka, when this is all  
over, promise me we&#146;ll go back home.&#148; 	

Haruka returned the embrace.  &#147;I promise.  I&#146;ll even take you  back to 
the coast.&#148; 	Michiru smiled.  

&#147;And you&#146;ll keep me out all night long and never  let me go?&#148; 	

&#147;Right,&#148; answered Haruka with a grin of her own.  &#147;I&#146;ll even buy you 
an ice cream cone.&quot;</pre>
