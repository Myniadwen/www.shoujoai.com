<h1>Paralyzed (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/paralyzed-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Eventually as the evening moved into night, the bonfire dimmed and stars 
grew more visible in the sky, conversation softening as the nighttime 
atmosphere encouraged it. Minako and Usagi both seemed close to falling 
asleep, one&#39;s yawn triggering the other to do likewise, earning soft 
chuckles from Rei and Haruka as Makoto fought the urge to pull Minako 
into her lap. For her part, she was wide awake with nervousness, one 
member of their group, in her opinion the most important, still needing 
to be told of the new development between herself and Minako. As the 
full moon crept higher in the sky, Michiru finally suggested that 
everyone turn in for the evening, noting that the den was where she had 
set up sleeping bags for the others. A general relaxed and sleepy 
agreement came with this suggestion, the nine girls all standing and 
heading into the large home shared by the Outer Senshi, goodnights 
exchanged, and parting to the separate rooms. Makoto hung back a bit, 
Minako falling into step next to her and briefly leaning up to kiss 
Makoto&#39;s cheek as she smiled softly, resting her hand on the other 
girl&#39;s upper arm as she spoke with a low tone of voice.

&quot;I know, I&#39;m nervous too, but you know, I really don&#39;t think we have to 
be.&quot;

Makoto ran her hand through her bangs and sighed lightly. &quot;Yeah, I know. 
But there&#39;s that tiny, itty bitty chance...&quot;

Minako wrinkled her nose a little, glancing ahead at the other three 
before pulling Makoto into a spare room, wrapping her arms around the 
Jovian senshi&#39;s neck and leaning up to press into a firm kiss. Makoto 
closed her eyes and wrapped her arms around Minako&#39;s waist, holding her 
tightly to her, making a reluctant sound as the blond pulled back. 
&quot;Mako-chan, if we worried about the itty bitty chances all the time, 
we&#39;d make bad senshi, and would never live life. I&#39;ve never quite been 
worried about Usagi-chan, it was Rei and Ami I was most worried about, 
and they&#39;ve soothed my fears pretty damn well. Remember, this is Usagi 
we&#39;re talking about, do you think she&#39;d really hate us?&quot;

Reaching up, Makoto softly stroked her fingers over Minako&#39;s cheeks, 
momentarily lost in the sky blue of her girlfriends&#39; eyes, thinking 
briefly that no sky could ever match their beauty. A small smile quirked 
it&#39;s way to her lips, and she sighed lightly. &quot;No, I don&#39;t think she&#39;d 
hate us. Id wager she&#39;d be happy...and she was sort of acting all 
&#39;knowing&#39; at the club...&quot;

Minako giggled softly and rested her head on Makoto&#39;s shoulder, feeling 
the goosepimples that popped up as the other girl lightly stroked her 
fingers over her bare back, Minako having only put on a sarong after 
getting out of the pool. Closing her eyes, she nuzzled her cheek to the 
tall girl&#39;s arm, smiling at the feel of strong muscles below the skin. 
&quot;Exactly...and kami-sama Mako, I love your muscles.&quot; She grinned and 
leaned her head back, her hands on Makoto&#39;s shoulders, her grin growing 
a little more as she spied the blush dusting over her cheeks.

&quot;You don&#39;t want me to get all toned like a body builder, do you?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, I like this lithe sort of look. And it&#39;s so much more fun to 
feel the muscle definition by touching you anyway.&quot;

A deepening of the blush brought more heat to Makoto&#39;s cheeks. She 
glanced briefly at the closed door, then leaned down to press her lips 
to Minako&#39;s again. Minako happily accepted the kiss, making a small 
sound as she closed her eyes, hands tightening on the taller girl&#39;s 
shoulders for a few moments before she pushed Makoto back, not breaking 
contact between them, Makoto grunting lightly as she bumped back against 
the wall, her hands squeezing Minako&#39;s hips. Minako&#39;s hands roamed 
boldly over Makoto&#39;s torso, the brunette blushing brightly as she opened 
her eyes, meeting Minako&#39;s look and noting the flushed state of her 
cheeks as well.

Groaning faintly, Makoto broke the kiss and leaned her forehead to 
Minako&#39;s shoulder, smirking to herself as she playfully groped her 
girlfriend, thinking to herself how nice it felt to think of Minako that 
way. &quot;Your touch is like fire, Mina-koi.&quot;

Minako giggled, a musical sound that made Makoto smile. &quot;That&#39;s Rei&#39;s 
department, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Like liquid metal&#39; doesn&#39;t sound quite as romantic.&quot;

Another giggle. &quot;Well, no, but more appropriate, no?&quot;

&quot;I suppose I &#39;send shocks&#39; through you?&quot;

&quot;Only when I&#39;m barefoot.&quot;

Makoto laughed, then blinked and leaned her head back. &quot;Wait, 
seriously?&quot;

Minako giggled and brushed her lips over Makoto&#39;s. &quot;Seriously. Though 
mostly when the air is dry or there&#39;s a storm near, didn&#39;t you ever 
notice that? You&#39;ve shocked all of us more than once, but I think we&#39;re 
used to it.&quot;

Makoto shook her head slightly and kissed Minako&#39;s forehead. &quot;Sorry if 
it ever hurts.&quot;

&quot;Nah, though one time you numbed my hand for a while.&quot;

&quot;I think I actually remember that one.&quot;

Minako grinned and slipped her hands into Makoto&#39;s, leaning back as she 
took one step back from the taller girl. Opening her mouth to say 
something, she was interrupted by a voice from the door.

&quot;I was going to say &#39;get a room&#39; but it looks like you two might have 
already? What, not going to stay out with us anymore?&quot; Usagi grinned for 
a moment before she summoned a pout to her lips, her eyes shining as she 
watched the briefly stunned look on the faces of her two protectors. 
&quot;And, just when exactly were you planning on telling me?&quot;

Makoto sputtered a little, her cheeks flushed. Minako let go of Makoto&#39;s 
hands and stuck her tongue out at Usagi, relief fighting with the last 
bits of nervousness in her eyes as she picked up a pillow and threw it 
towards the door. &quot;If you weren&#39;t so impatient, we were going to 
tonight!&quot; Minako laughed lightly as Usagi ducked the thrown pillow, 
picking it up before she walked into the room.

&quot;Well, I thought so, but I also thought that you&#39;d both possibly like it 
a little better if I came to you about it. Good thing for me you two 
kissing and being all cute together made it easy.&quot; Usagi giggled and 
wrapped Minako into a tight hug, reaching out to pull the still slightly 
flustered Makoto into it as well.

Makoto hugged both girls tightly to her, nuzzling her face to Minako&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;I...thank you, Usagi-chan...&quot; She looked up to their reason 
for fighting, their reason for living, truthfully, her eyes shining with 
the hint of tears. &quot;...we were afraid you&#39;d not accept it...&quot;

Usagi huffed and lightly hit Makoto on the arm. &quot;Not accept it? Why 
wouldn&#39;t I be happy for two of my best friends for finding happiness and 
love with each other?&quot;

Minako wrinkled her nose a little. &quot;Well, we knew you would, but, 
there&#39;s always that tiny chance, you know? I know we try not to think 
about or worry about that tiny chance, but you&#39;re so important to us 
Usagi...we&#39;d be foolish to not be afraid of losing you, you know?&quot;

Usagi faintly bit her lower lip as she thought for a few moments, a 
different, more serious expression than one they&#39;d often see when she 
struggled with schoolwork. Nodding a little, she looked between her two 
friends, her smile bright and caring. &quot;I can understand that, I think 
the same thing sometimes. I&#39;m glad that you trusted me enough to not 
hide it though! I think I&#39;d be just a little peeved if you two did that 
you know.&quot;

Chuckling, Makoto lightly pushed against the two blonds backs, coaxing 
them towards the door. &quot;Telling people was the second thing we talked 
about. We&#39;d not hide it from you guys.&quot;

Usagi smirked as she let Makoto push her towards the door. &quot;Yeah, you 
two just hid it from yourselves instead!&quot;

Minako threw her hands up in the air. &quot;Argh, did everyone know before we 
did? I swear, sometimes I really hate how clueless I can be 
sometimes...&quot; She squeaked softly when Makoto&#39;s hand roamed lower than 
her back, giving the tall girl a playful grin over her shoulder as she 
emphasized the swing of her hips for a moment.

&quot;Hey, it made it easier to tell them at least.&quot; Makoto chuckled, her 
eyes obviously watching Minako, relief at Usagi&#39;s acceptance and knowing 
that her friends were all okay with it allowing her to be a little more 
obvious with where her attention was drawn. A tiny part of her mind 
reveled at the fact that she didn&#39;t have to hide it from anyone anymore, 
but after a moment&#39;s gawking, she pulled her eyes away as they walked 
into the hallway.

Rei smirked at them from the doorway to the den. &quot;Gee, running off to a 
private room you two?&quot;

&quot;All the better to tease you with, Rei-chan.&quot; Minako grinned as she 
breezed past Rei, the fire senshi briefly blushing at the statement 
before she turned and took a playful swing at the blond, the swat 
deflected by Makoto who caught Minako in one arm, Minako laughing and 
Ami giggling from her spot on the couch.

&quot;Great, Ami, we&#39;re out numbered now, and instead of just Usagi and 
Mamoru, now we get to watch these two goofs too!&quot; Rei tried to pout, 
laughing when Usagi hit her with a pillow.

&quot;Hey, we&#39;re not that bad!&quot; Usagi defended herself.

&quot;When Mamoru gets back from classes you&#39;re all over him!&quot; Rei retaliated 
with her own pillow, sending Usagi tumbling into the pile of sleeping 
bags.

&quot;Nothing wrong with that, I fully intend to be all over Makoto.&quot; Minako 
smirked from where she managed to climb around to Makoto&#39;s back. Usagi 
threw another pillow at Rei while declaring &#39;see?&#39;, completely missing 
the raven haired girl and hitting Ami, who for her part was prepared and 
already holding a pillow, throwing one back at Usagi but managing to hit 
Makoto instead, Minako playfully tumbling off of her shoulders and 
dramatically falling into the sleeping bags. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m hit! Defend me, 
Mako!&quot;

Makoto laughed, already well on her way to doing just that, using two 
pillows as she fended off the dual attacks of Rei and Ami, the room soon 
filled with giggles as the pillowfight progressed.
Eventually, three out of the five girls drifted off to sleep, curled or 
sprawled out on their sleeping bags, soft snores coming from Rei. Minako 
had rolled up against Ami, who took the opportunity to use the blond as 
a pillow, both fast asleep. Makoto leaned on her side, looking down at 
Minako with a soft smile on her face, reaching out to softly stroke a 
few hairs from her face.

&quot;You two really are cute together, you know.&quot; Usagi&#39;s soft voice 
startled Makoto a bit as she glanced over at the other blond, smiling a 
little sheepishly.

&quot;Thanks, I think. I&#39;ll try not to be all oglely or overly affectionate 
when we&#39;re around you guys, but it&#39;s really really hard to resist right 
now, you know?&quot; Makoto blushed softly.

Usagi giggled. &quot;Oh, I know. I&#39;m sure you guys remember how I was with 
Mamo-chan when we first were together again.&quot;

Makoto laughed softly. &quot;Oh yes, and I remember how Rei acted too, which 
is why Im going to keep it as restrained as possible. But when I think 
no one&#39;s looking, don&#39;t be surprised if I stare.&quot; She smiled and leaned 
down to lightly kiss Minako&#39;s cheek, the girl shifting a little as she 
smiled in her sleep. Makoto laid down and rolled onto her back, turning 
her head towards Usagi. &quot;This doesn&#39;t lessen anything else, you know.&quot;

Reaching out, Usagi lightly &#39;beeped&#39; Makoto&#39;s nose before yawning 
widely, settling down next to the tall senshi, grunting faintly as Rei 
shifted and kneed her in the back. &quot;I know Mako-chan. I&#39;ll never have to 
worry about you four, ever.&quot; Her deep blue eyes shone a bit in the dim 
light of the den before she closed them, hugging a pillow to her chest 
as she curled on her side. &quot;G&#39;night Mako-chan.&quot;

&quot;Goodnight Usagi-chan.&quot;

&quot;I love you all..&quot; Her voice was already a little slurred as she quickly 
fell asleep, leaving Makoto grinning up at the ceiling. Closing her 
eyes, her fears driven away and heart swelled with love, Makoto slipped 
off into the realm of dreams with a smile on her lips, surrounded by 
those she loved.

And she wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.
