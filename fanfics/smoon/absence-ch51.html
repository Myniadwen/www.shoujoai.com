<h1>Absence (part 51 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch50.html">Back to Part 50</a><pre>&quot;Sometimes I question your sanity,&quot; Iason muttered as Lazarus finished 
explaining his &#39;plan&#39;, if you could even call it that, to execute the 
mystery Sailor Senshi the blue-suited youma had encountered in Minato 
General Hospital, and the human&#39;s allies with her. &quot;You told her where 
our base of operations is,&quot; he said slowly, a statement more than a 
request for clarification, as if he was having trouble comprehending the 
information. Iason folded his arms and blinked a few times from where he 
stood in front of Lord Makareus&#39; desk. &quot;And then, you invited her 
--*and* her Sailor Senshi companions I might add-- to come and &#39;meet&#39; 
you here.&quot; The second in command youma shook his head, outwardly 
appearing mildly befuddled, but inwardly incredulous. &quot;You willingly 
compromised our whole operation. You&#39;ve made this &#39;plan&#39; of yours an all 
or nothing venture. You risk everything. That is *not* our way.&quot;

&quot;There are always risks,&quot; Lazarus rasped without inflection from the 
dark little corner of the office he liked to dwell in when before 
Iason&#39;s master. The assassin was leaning casually back against the wall 
with his head bowed, seeming as cool and as laidback as ever. Iason just 
knew that hidden beneath that mask was a constant smug grin... most 
likely directed at him. &quot;What is life, without risks?&quot;

&quot;A far better situation than we have now,&quot; Iason answered with some 
sarcasm in a near sneer, his eyes narrowing as he glared coldly at the 
Night Haunter. &quot;The entire Sailor Senshi group could be heading here as 
we speak, thanks to your impetuousness. We will have to abandon this 
building, and with it, scores of resources; there is simply not enough 
time to salvage everything.&quot; It had taken Iason a long time to acquire 
the skyscraper, weeks of secretly filtering out the human occupants and 
replacing them with youma agents until the whole office building became 
his Lord&#39;s property. That it was now to be lost due to some outsider&#39;s 
reckless meddling galled him greatly.

&quot;Perhaps now is the time...&quot; Iason heard Lord Makareus murmur from the 
chair behind the desk.

&quot;My Lord?&quot; Iason questioned his master crisply, turning to the demon and 
moving his hands behind his back in a gesture of servitude.

&quot;There has been so much delay as it is; we must take advantage of these 
new developments,&quot; Lord Makareus continued in a louder voice. He looked 
up at his second in command with a steady gaze. &quot;No matter how dire 
circumstances are, one can always find a way to use them to their own 
gain. That is a skill of a true master of manipulation.&quot; The demon stood 
up and leaned forward, placing his fists on the desk as a keen and 
rather sinister smile pulled up the corners of his mouth. &quot;Gather our 
troops. All of them. Recall those in the field as well,&quot; Lord Makareus 
ordered Iason. He stepped out from behind the desk and turned around, 
looking out the large rectangular window at a bright structure on the 
dark horizon. &quot;It is time to open the gate.&quot;

&quot;*Now* my Lord?&quot; Iason inquired, a little puzzled and somewhat 
concerned. &quot;Would it not be better to withdraw from here and regroup 
elsewhere?&quot;

&quot;We *are* withdrawing, and after this, there will be no need to 
regroup,&quot; the demon stated, his back still to his subordinate. &quot;You know 
what must be done. I want that structure locked down. At this time of 
night, no humans should be present, but I want absolutely none alive in 
the near vicinity, just to be safe. This *is* an all or nothing venture; 
there can be no room for mistakes.&quot; Lord Makareus turned away from the 
window to face Iason once more. &quot;I trust that you will not be the cause 
of any,&quot; he said coldly, the iris&#39; of his eyes flashing through a cycle 
of many shades of colour in as many seconds.

&quot;You have my assurances, my Lord,&quot; Iason guaranteed Lord Makareus 
firmly, his gaze drawn like a moth to flame to the spectacle in his 
master&#39;s eyes that betrayed his demonic heritage. The youma subordinate 
felt no fear at the unnatural display, but instead respect and 
deference. Iason simply didn&#39;t have the capability to experience that 
particular emotion, fear, anymore.

&quot;The Silent Blades and I shall remain here,&quot; Lazarus said, having 
previously been silently observing the exchange.

&quot;Naturally. You wished to work alone on slaying that irritating Sailor 
Senshi. This is the results of your... &#39;methods&#39;,&quot; Lord Makareus said 
frostily, directing his gaze at the arrogant masked assassin. &quot;And you 
will see them through. Earn your keep.&quot;

Iason couldn&#39;t help a slight twitch in his lips that threatened to curl 
his mouth into a conceited grin. The &#39;mighty&#39; grandmaster assassin had 
foolishly painted himself into a corner. Now Lazarus and his order had 
to succeed in executing all the Sailor Senshi tonight, in this building, 
or face definite severe reprimands from Lord Makareus. If the Night 
Haunter and his followers failed, it would be better for them if they 
had all perished. It truly was an all or nothing venture for Lazarus. 
Iason would certainly not miss him.

The dark figure cloaked in shadows in the corner of the room remained 
quiet, and merely nodded in acceptance of Lord Makareus&#39; commands. While 
it was an all or nothing mission for Lazarus, it was a win-win situation 
for Iason. If the assassin and his company did in fact manage to kill 
the Sailor Senshi that showed up at the office skyscraper, then it was 
almost without a shadow of a doubt that the interdimensional gate spell 
would be preformed without a hitch-- the lack of any distracting 
opposition would make the casting hardly a chore at all. At the very 
least, Lazarus would divert the Sailors&#39; attention away from the portal 
invocation site, giving Lord Makareus plenty of time to bring forth the 
legions of youma waiting fervently in Iason&#39;s home plane of Pandemonium, 
all raring to claim Earth in their master&#39;s name. Even if any Sailor 
Senshi survived the Silent Blades&#39; attack, they would eventually be 
slaughtered in the ensuing siege. A quite perfect set up in Iason&#39;s 
estimation.

Though, the second in command youma had to admit, he had personally 
wanted to challenge and put to death one particular senshi, and her 
mousy little mate with her. Iason still had a score to settle between 
himself and the pair of Sailor Senshi, Jupiter and Mercury, and he had 
intended to forcefully resolve it. However... the youma wasn&#39;t one of 
the deceased Khairephon&#39;s ilk; he would not rashly pursue his two 
enemies when both would wind up butchered anyway, even if it wasn&#39;t by 
his hand. As long as Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Mercury ended up just 
plain dead was completely fine in Iason&#39;s book.

&quot;It is time for this campaign to come to a close,&quot; Lord Makareus said 
softly, more to himself than to the other two occupants of the office. 
But Iason couldn&#39;t have agreed more.

******

Tsubasa looked carefully in the vanity mirror on the passenger side of 
the newly rented blue compact car, delicately prodding at his burnt 
face. As flakes of dry, dead skin fell from his scorched visage, his 
mood became even gloomier. He wasn&#39;t going to win any beauty prizes, 
that was for sure. Sailor Mars&#39; fiery arrow had done quite a number on 
his face, the superheated projectile&#39;s close flight path having given 
his skin a raw, sunburnt appearance. It was very uncomfortable.

Tsubasa squirted some moisturising cream from a tube into the palm of 
one hand, and then gingerly applied the cool soothing mixture to his 
sore face. The things he endured because of his feeble heart. He had 
abandoned a perfectly good job in Yokohama and travelled to another city 
with a totally selfish blockhead as a companion, to only become more 
entangled in some sort of monster invasion, get in a car crash, and have 
his face nearly fried to a crisp. And all because of a girl, who just so 
happened to be the same girl who was responsible for his peeling 
features. It was a whole new level of pathetic for Tsubasa. Sure, he had 
had crushes before, but none as bad and as fruitless as this one, and 
certainly not one for a magical girl, a Sailor Senshi, no less.

Sanjuro had filled him in on some background of the magical girl team, 
but Tsubasa&#39;s mind still had trouble dealing with the fact that he 
actually knew one of the senshi personally. The group even had 
merchandise designed after them for god&#39;s sake. Tsubasa sighed miserably 
while he finished off applying the cream to his stinging face. A 
hopeless crush on Sailor Mars, a girl who was probably already the crush 
and idol of millions all over the country. Okay, so he may have an 
advantage over the masses since he knew her true identity, but even that 
wasn&#39;t worth squat when the girl was utterly in love with someone else, 
and the &#39;someone else&#39; happened to be a girl also. Tsubasa was beginning 
to think he was a masochist for even staying here in Tokyo for this 
long. He should just pack up and go back home already. The main reason 
he was here was because of Rei; his feelings had initially led him to 
the bustling metropolis; his aspirations to make a difference in the 
fight against evil had been secondary to the wish in his heart. And they 
still were; Tsubasa&#39;s feelings for the miko were what were giving him 
the incentive to stay in Tokyo and see this youma invasion through to 
the end. He just hoped the end didn&#39;t consist of the entire city, and 
then the country, closely followed by the world, being consumed in a 
storm of gnashing teeth and slashing claws that turned the human race 
into fertiliser. While Tsubasa&#39;s life pretty much stunk, he certainly 
didn&#39;t feel like taking a dirt nap just yet, and he was confident that 
most people elsewhere in the world really didn&#39;t either.

Tsubasa dabbed the last dregs of remaining cream off his fingertips onto 
his scorched face and rubbed the mixture in, before turning his head to 
his company sitting in the driver&#39;s seat. Even though Tsubasa had 
provided the cash to rent a new car, and had wisely payed extra for 
insurance, Sanjuro had insisted, no, *demanded* that he drive. While 
Sanjuro&#39;s crazy driving made Tsubasa&#39;s last meal want to forcibly bring 
itself up, he had to admit that the ex-reporter was a skilled driver and 
that in a situation where a hasty getaway from unspeakable evil or an 
infuriated Rei was called for, he would prefer the spiky-haired man 
behind the wheel. Besides, Sanjuro would have probably incessantly 
complained about Tsubasa&#39;s driving until he got his own way anyway. 
Until Tsubasa knocked him out to get some peace, that is.

&quot;How&#39;s it look?&quot; the brown-haired man asked Sanjuro, referring to his 
red raw face.

The self-centred ex-reporter popped a few strawberry Pez candies into 
his mouth from his blue Goofy dispenser, and then glanced at Tsabasa. 
&quot;Like you had an intimate experience with napalm,&quot; Sanjuro deadpanned 
while he chewed on his sweets. He lifted his Pez dispenser towards an 
irritated Tsubasa, pulling back on the Goofy head with his thumb to 
expose one of the candies. &quot;Pez?&quot; he then offered cheerily, as if it 
would cure all his companion&#39;s ails.

Tsubasa stared at Sanjuro like the man was mentally challenged, and then 
shook his head. &quot;No,&quot; he declined grumpily, before returning his gaze to 
the vanity mirror to survey his face again, and hopefully make the 
damage less repulsive.

&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; Sanjuro said, and then looked out the driver&#39;s side 
window, up at the numerous steps that led to the Hikawa Jinja. He tilted 
his head back and emptied the Pez dispenser contents into his gaping 
maw. &quot;Man, those cops. I can&#39;t believe they actually kept us in that 
hellhole they called a holding cell for twenty-four hours,&quot; the 
ex-reporter whined as he strained his neck to try and actually see the 
buildings that made up the shrine at the top of the long staircase. &quot;My 
lawyer would&#39;ve had a field day. I mean geez; anybody could tell that we 
had nothing to do with that bloodbath back at that school. Lame cops; it 
was obviously youma.&quot; He reached out with one hand and fumbled blindly 
for another packet of Pez that resided on the dashboard, not taking his 
eyes away from the Hikawa Jinja steps across the street. &quot;Those bastard 
youma. I bet they wanted the students&#39; brains... those kinds of 
creatures always like the big fat smart brains... they probably wanted 
to eat them, the sickos... but better them than me, I guess...&quot; Sanjuro 
mumbled absently as he expertly removed the foil wrapping from the pack 
of candy. He shifted his gaze away from the view outside the window and 
attempted to slot more Pez into his dispenser. After several seconds of 
frustrated grunts and bit off curses, he eventually threw the blue 
dispenser in defeat over his shoulder onto the back seat behind him, and 
then resorted to cramming the sweets into his mouth. &quot;Damn things are so 
hard to load,&quot; Sanjuro bemoaned through chews. The ex-reporter then went 
back to looking intently out the window again. He positioned his head in 
a variety of angles for a few seconds, and then let out an annoyed 
breath. &quot;Crap. I can&#39;t see jack from here. I&#39;m going up those steps for 
a better look.&quot;

As Sanjuro opened the car door, Tsubasa was jarred out of his 
well-practiced selective hearing state, finally tuning in to what the 
irritating spiky-haired man was saying exactly. &quot;Wait! You can&#39;t do 
that!&quot; he wailed emphatically, snapping his head sharply to the right to 
look at Sanjuro.

&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Sanjuro groaned, throwing his hands up in a gesture of 
impatience while rolling his eyes as he turned back to Tsubasa. &quot;I 
*know* something is going down up there. All those chicks and a dude 
meeting up at Rei&#39;s shrine at this time of night? Either they&#39;re having 
one hell of an orgy, or there&#39;s youma stuff afoot.&quot; He paused for an 
instant, appearing to contemplate something. &quot;You know, both ways are 
good,&quot; Sanjuro the hentai added, a lecherous grin slowly coming to his 
features.

Tsubasa made a face at Sanjuro while the ex-reporter&#39;s mind was no doubt 
swimming with ecchi fantasies. Two of those &#39;chicks&#39; were entirely too 
young to be a part of the man&#39;s unwholesome imaginations. &quot;It&#39;s too 
risky, they might see you. Rei already knows we&#39;re following her, if she 
catches you who knows what she might do,&quot; Tsubasa argued desperately, 
hoping to forestall his partner in crime from making any rash decisions. 
He didn&#39;t want Rei mad at him. Plus knowing Tsubasa&#39;s luck, Sanjuro 
would be caught and then be mistaken for a peeping tom by the girls, and 
after beating up the ex-reporter, making him blab about everything, they 
would hunt down Tsubasa and give him the same unpleasant treatment. 
Afterwards, Rei would probably never speak to him again, and right now, 
she hardly even did that, except to yell at him and dispense insults. 
The whole idea had disaster written all over it.

&quot;Man, have some guts, you wimp,&quot; Sanjuro said, the remark all the more 
offensive coming from a coward like him. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if all 
those babes where Sailor Senshi; we just gotta find out!&quot; He grinned 
feverishly, waving an eager fist at Tsubasa. &quot;They&#39;re all probably 
preparing for a huge kick ass assault against some youma base! I can see 
it now, the carnage, the mayhem! Stuff blowing up all over the place! 
Mad magical powers flying left, right, and centre! Evil, ugly monsters 
getting their heads pounded! Oh man, I gotta get some photos of all that 
stuff!&quot;

Tsubasa quickly grabbed Sanjuro&#39;s arm before the worked up ex-reporter 
could bolt for the shrine and probably clumsily crash through a window, 
and then end up using Rei&#39;s lap to break his fall. That would definitely 
not go over well. While seeing Rei use Sanjuro as a punching bag would 
be amusing, Tsubasa just knew the hotheaded miko would soon turn on him 
too.

&quot;No way, you&#39;re staying here!&quot; Tsubasa insisted, holding onto his 
excited companion&#39;s arm in a vice-like grip, desperate to prevent any 
catastrophe. &quot;If you&#39;re spotted --and you will be-- Rei will get really 
mad.&quot;

Sanjuro ceased trying to struggle away from Tsubasa, and then sighed in 
a longsuffering way. &quot;Rei&#39;s *always* mad, you idiot. She&#39;s fiery, 
feisty, and doesn&#39;t take crap from anybody. That&#39;s what makes Sailor 
Mars so cool.... and also the whole pyromania thing.&quot; He then eyed 
Tsubasa and smirked, snorting derisively. &quot;Though I guess I&#39;m already 
preaching to the choir...&quot;

Tsubasa let go of Sanjuro&#39;s arm and looked away from the man, glowering 
at the pavement outside of the parked vehicle he was sitting in. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what you mean,&quot; he said sourly.

&quot;That&#39;s it; I can&#39;t take this no more!&quot; Sanjuro cried out, looking up at 
the car&#39;s grey fabric ceiling as if it could give him strength to 
tolerate any hardships. &quot;All your brooding and moping and junk; it&#39;s 
driving me crazy! I&#39;ve lost count of how many depressed sighs you&#39;ve 
made in the past couple of minutes. For the love of *god*, for the sake 
of all our sanities, would you just tell Rei how you feel about her 
already!&quot;

&quot;How I feel about Rei...?&quot; Tsubasa repeated, feigning ignorance.

&quot;Oh geez! You are pathetic!&quot; Sanjuro moaned, slapping his hands on the 
sides of his face and dragging them down slowly. &quot;Look, if you don&#39;t say 
something to her, I will.&quot;

Realising denial was futile, and while trying to figure out if his 
feelings for Rei were so obvious that even a dummy like Sanjuro could 
detect them, Tsubasa decided to drop the bewildered act. And then let 
out another one of his apparently patented depressed sighs.

&quot;What would be the point? All it would do is make things more 
complicated than they already are for Rei,&quot; Tsubasa said in a resigned 
tone.

Sanjuro pursed his lips and settled back into his seat, looking out the 
windscreen. &quot;Yeah... I guess,&quot; he admitted contemplatively. &quot;Yeah, like 
you could ever be good enough for Sailor Mars!&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Tsubasa said flatly. The ex-reporter didn&#39;t need to add 
that last part.

&quot;She likes hot slinky blondes with odango hairstyles anyway,&quot; Sanjuro 
continued unabated, &quot;and last time I checked, you don&#39;t fit that 
category.&quot;

Tsubasa rested his head back against the car seat and stared blankly up 
at the vanity mirror. An unsightly sunburnt man&#39;s face stared back at 
him. Great, Rei probably wouldn&#39;t be able to stand looking at him now. 
And lately, she had seemed to be downcast. Tsubasa closed his eyes, 
recalling how the raven-haired beauty had appeared so dejected and 
defeated. He was sure something had happened in the past day or so to 
make Rei that way, and he was also sure that that something had to do 
with Usagi. Rei&#39;s moods usually tended to revolve around her best 
friend. Maybe Usagi had broken up with the miko. Tsubasa wouldn&#39;t have 
been surprised if the blonde had done so. He knew that the relationship 
had been destined for a painful ending. *Life* was painful, after all; 
what chance did forbidden love have in the face of reality? Tsubasa 
shook his head, still with his eyes shut. No chance, apparently. But he 
had already known that fact long ago. Rei had fought hard for her true 
love&#39;s heart, and if she had indeed failed, then what hope was there for 
a guy like Tsubasa? Rei&#39;s philosophy had been to fight for what she 
desired, while his was to let what he desired come to him gently of its 
own volition. Both ways looked like they were failures.

The depressed man chuckled quietly; a cynical, jaded laugh. Perhaps a 
dirt nap wasn&#39;t such a bad fate when you thought about it; it certainly 
was looking better all the time.

******

&quot;...And that&#39;s it in a nutshell,&quot; Rei finished slightly demurely, 
concluding her account on what Lazarus had said to her, but leaving out 
one small, specific, detail. She lowered her gaze down to the square 
wooden table she was sitting in front of, preventing any eye contact 
with the assembled active Sailor Senshi and the Prince of Earth who were 
crowded into her bedroom at the Hikawa Jinja. She had an uneasy feeling 
that one of her friends would be able to tell she had omitted something 
from her story if they met her eyes. Especially if that friend happened 
to be a certain odango atama.

&quot;Do I really have to say that this is obviously a trap?&quot; Minako said 
from where she was sitting next to Rei. &quot;Again? It&#39;s like these youma 
love this kinda set up.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Makoto mumbled thoughtfully, idly picking at a long thin scab 
on her neck. It looked like she had been hanged a number of times with a 
thin piece of rope, as did her partner, Ami, who had similar scars. 
Gifts from the clash with the youma in Minato Hospital, no doubt. &quot;Last 
time we got an invitation to check out some youma headquarters, the 
entire place exploded and half of us were nearly killed.&quot; Rei caught 
Hotaru fidgeting nervously in Michiru&#39;s lap to the right of her at the 
mention of the explosion. The Senshi of Rebirth&#39;s face was still a 
little smashed up, but mercifully neither Ami nor Makoto had asked about 
it. Perhaps they already knew the circumstances behind the young girl&#39;s 
injuries.

Ami absently reached up to her brunette love beside her and gently but 
insistently drew the tall girl&#39;s arm down to her side. &quot;If you keep 
picking at them they will never heal,&quot; the Senshi of Water chastised in 
a murmur, entwining her fingers with Makoto&#39;s to prevent further 
scratching, and causing her lover to give her a sheepish grin. &quot;And as 
before I don&#39;t see that we have much choice in the matter,&quot; Ami then 
said in a louder voice to the rest of the room&#39;s occupants. &quot;It is the 
only clue we have to the remaining demon&#39;s headquarters. At the very 
least, we can destroy whatever youma are present at the location given 
to Rei, or use them to lead us to more youma.&quot;

&quot;Where exactly is this location?&quot; Michiru inquired as she wrapped her 
arms loosely around Hotaru in a comforting gesture.

&quot;I believe it is a high-rise plaza at the outskirts of Minato-ku,&quot; Ami 
replied to the Senshi of the Ocean.

&quot;So...&quot; Minako drawled out, glancing around the table to each person in 
turn. &quot;What do we do?&quot; She paused for a moment, seeing that Rei, Usagi, 
Mamoru, and not to mention Chibi-Usa all looked preoccupied. &quot;Uhh... 
guys?&quot;

Rei tensed as she felt her unoccupied friends&#39; eyes on her. The tension 
in the air between her, Usagi, and Mamoru was highly noticeable to her, 
and she was certain it was obvious to everyone else in the room too. But 
of course by now, all her friends knew what had happened between the 
trio. The miko didn&#39;t want to raise her eyes from the tabletop to see 
Usagi and be reminded of her pain... and yet, she craved the gorgeous 
sight of her princess at the same time. She supposed it would always be 
this way now. Suffering and longing were her eternal companions. 
Unless... the mask gave her a second chance. Rei still hadn&#39;t truly 
decided exactly what she would do once she got her hands on the 
artefact, but then most of her important decisions in life were made on 
the spur of the moment. Plus there was also Setsuna to think about. 
Using the mask to view the timeline would incur the Guardian of Time&#39;s 
wrath... well, her disapproval at any rate. Rei was sure that after she 
talked to Setsuna about using the mask, if she indeed decided to use it, 
that the women would eventually be swayed by her words. The Fire Senshi 
knew she would be taking advantage of Setsuna&#39;s more than fuzzy feelings 
towards her, but she couldn&#39;t help it.

&quot;We go,&quot; Mamoru said quietly after a short silence, bringing Rei out of 
her inner thoughts. &quot;Ami&#39;s right; even if it isn&#39;t the demon&#39;s base, we 
can at least get vengeance against the youma there for what they did at 
Juuban High School.&quot;

Rei looked up from the table and nodded gravely. &quot;Agreed. We owe it to 
those who suffered and lost their lives because of us.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s settled then,&quot; Minako declared, slapping her hands on the table 
and pushing herself up from her sitting position. &quot;We&#39;re taking the 
bait.&quot; She let out a small sigh and scratched her blonde head. &quot;I 
figured it would wind up this way. So who&#39;s gonna stay behind this time 
and look after Haruka and Setsuna?&quot;

&quot;Speaking of which; who&#39;s looking after them right now?&quot; Makoto 
interrupted, turning her head to Michiru.

&quot;No one,&quot; the aquamarine-haired woman informed the group. &quot;Setsuna 
insisted she would be fine, and Haruka...&quot; Michiru paused in mid breath, 
and a slight smile graced her lips. &quot;Haruka assured me she could take 
care of any threat that happened to cross her path.&quot;

&quot;Still, one or two of us had better stay behind and watch over them,&quot; 
Ami suggested. &quot;While I&#39;m sure Haruka is confident that she can best any 
youma that may take advantage of our absence, she and Setsuna are not at 
their peak physical condition at the moment.&quot;

&quot;I have a feeling we&#39;re going to need everyone on this one,&quot; Rei said 
softly from where she still sat at the small table, the troubling 
memories of the vision and the emotions that came with it flickering 
over and over again in her mind.

&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Minako asked, looking down curiously at the 
astute miko.

&quot;Call it instinct,&quot; Rei replied cryptically. &quot;Anyway, the meeting place 
is a big, tall, skyscraper, right?&quot; she went on in a more normal, and 
yet still somewhat subdued, tone. &quot;Worst case scenario, the whole 
building is chock full of youma nastiness, all waiting patiently to 
ambush us.&quot;

&quot;Be that as it may, I think it would put all our hearts at ease if 
someone were to watch over Setsuna and Haruka,&quot; Ami said.

&quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; Chibi-Usa piped up from beside the silent Usagi across the 
table from Rei, as she thrust an eager hand up in the air above her, 
volunteering herself for guard duty.

&quot;You can&#39;t,&quot; Usagi argued in a quiet but insistent voice, breaking her 
self-imposed mute state. &quot;What would mom say if she looked in your room 
and found you missing at this time of night? She&#39;d totally freak. And we 
don&#39;t know how long we&#39;re going to be out; you could be stuck at the 
hospital until morning.&quot;

&quot;Geez, Usagi!&quot; the future princess whined. &quot;I could make the same 
arguments against you! I want to look after Puu and Haruka! I can do 
this, I know it!&quot;

&quot;Oh, but Chibi-Usa, what if youma *do* attack the hospital?&quot; Hotaru 
said, noticeably worried about her best friend&#39;s welfare. &quot;No one would 
be able to help you except for Setsuna-mama and Haruka-papa, and they&#39;re 
not well; it&#39;s too dangerous!&quot; The dark-haired girl&#39;s expression then 
turned determined, and she nodded her head firmly, appearing to come to 
a decision. &quot;I think I should stay behind too,&quot; the Senshi of Rebirth 
concluded resolutely.

&quot;Hotaru...&quot; Chibi-Usa moaned, drawing out the Outer Senshi&#39;s name. &quot;I&#39;ll 
be okay. The others will probably need your help anyway. I&#39;ll be fine by 
myself.&quot; The pink-haired girl leapt to her feet and flashed a V sign 
with the fingers of one hand, winking mischievously. &quot;Just leave it to 
me!&quot; Rei heard Minako mutter something about pending trademarks next to 
her.

&quot;I guess we don&#39;t have much choice if Rei&#39;s... instinct, is correct,&quot; 
Mamoru sighed. &quot;The enemy didn&#39;t attack the hospital the last time most 
of us were drawn to that mansion, lets hope they don&#39;t change their 
tactics...&quot;

&quot;Yay!&quot; Chibi-Usa cried triumphantly, and then promptly glomped her 
future father, nearly bowling the man over.

&quot;Fine then. Let&#39;s get going,&quot; Rei ordered, standing up from the table, 
but keeping her gaze pointedly away from her true love. &quot;I&#39;ll meet you 
all outside in a second; I want to change first,&quot; she informed her 
comrades. &quot;And try to be quiet; I don&#39;t want to have to explain to 
Yuuichirou or Grandpa why you&#39;re all in my bedroom this late at night.&quot;

The Senshi of Fire kept her eyes lowered as she heard her friends all 
shuffle out of her bedroom, chatting softly to one another. Soon the 
sounds ebbed, but Rei still sensed the presence of someone in the room 
with her. She raised her head slowly and saw that Usagi had remained. 
She had suspected as much. Rei blinked when she also noticed Mamoru 
lingering in the doorway behind her princess, observing the two of them. 
The prince simply watched the pair of girls impassively for a second, 
and then left the doorway without a word. It looked like Mamoru still 
had some trust left in Usagi to leave his girlfriend alone in the 
presence of her recent onetime lover, for which Rei was grateful; 
perhaps she hadn&#39;t damaged their relationship as much as she had feared. 
Although, the cynical side of her suggested that maybe Mamoru just 
didn&#39;t care if Usagi threw herself at her best friend to steal some 
illicit kisses or not. Either way, it truly didn&#39;t matter; Mamoru and 
Usagi&#39;s relationship would recover eventually, or at least enough for 
them to produce a child. It was their destiny.

&quot;Um... how are you...?&quot; Usagi asked tentatively, fidgeting nervously 
with her hands clasped in front of her.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Rei said, her lie transparent as glass. She turned away from her 
princess and moved to her dresser, before pulling open some drawers.

&quot;I think you&#39;d say you were &#39;fine&#39; even if both your legs were broken,&quot; 
Usagi said, giving a strained laugh at the end. Her laugh quickly waned 
and petered out weakly as Rei continued to give her dresser her full 
attention, appearing engrossed in raking through her clothes, searching 
for something to wear. Usagi rubbed her arm uncertainly and swallowed, 
before attempting to start up another conversation. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you 
in awhile, Rei...&quot; she commented softly, looking expectantly at her 
bodyguard&#39;s profile.

&quot;It&#39;s not even been two days yet, Usagi,&quot; Rei remarked dryly as she 
pulled out a dark sweater and pants from her dresser.

&quot;Oh... yeah...&quot;

Obviously disappointed and a little hurt by Rei&#39;s standoffish attitude, 
Usagi merely stood there in the Fire Senshi&#39;s bedroom, looking unsure as 
what to do or say next. Rei turned away from her dresser and in turn her 
only love, and then paused in mid motion with one hand clutching her 
clothes to her chest, the other still on one of her dresser&#39;s drawers. 
She sighed deeply and shut her eyes. Here Rei was, being selfish again. 
She shouldn&#39;t forget that she wasn&#39;t the only one hurting. Usagi was at 
least making an effort to re-establish contact, and with it their 
friendship, with her again; all Rei was doing was moping and shunning 
the girl like the plague. Rei shook her head slightly and chastised 
herself for being so inconsiderate.

&quot;Usagi... I&#39;m fine,&quot; Rei said in a somewhat weary voice, opening her 
eyes, but with her back still to her princess. &quot;I am, really.&quot;

&quot;But Rei--&quot;

&quot;I said not to worry about me,&quot; Rei interrupted gently. She turned 
around to face a dismal looking Usagi and put on a faint smile, holding 
her clothes tightly in front of her, like a makeshift shield. &quot;You have 
enough to deal with right now. Just worry about making up with Mamoru. 
Forget about me...&quot; Seeing her princess open her mouth to no doubt 
argue, the miko hurriedly continued. &quot;I&#39;m always going to be here. Right 
here. Waiting. There&#39;s no rush, Usagi; I&#39;ll always be your friend, 
*always*.&quot; Rei&#39;s smile increased a little, becoming reassuring, and yet, 
trembled ever so slightly. &quot;So don&#39;t concern yourself with me until 
you&#39;ve got other matters settled. We have... an eternity.&quot;

&quot;Do we?&quot; Usagi whispered, looking at Rei earnestly, as if she didn&#39;t 
believe her.

&quot;You know we do. It&#39;s the one thing we do have: time.&quot; The Senshi of 
Fire gestured with her head towards the door. &quot;I&#39;m going to change now, 
so...&quot;

Usagi blinked at Rei in confusion for a moment until she finally got the 
message, and then blushed adorably. The odango atama nodded a little 
rigidly, and then left the room, but not without a slight backwards 
glance. Rei let out a long breath and relaxed her tense muscles. She 
felt like in the past few weeks, she had aged many years. She felt old, 
worn-out, just... tired. Physically and mentally. The raven-haired girl 
knew it had nothing to do with the battles she had fought in. She 
wondered how Setsuna could have taken the feeling for more than a 
thousand years without simply crumbling. Rei suspected she would learn 
eventually.

Rei changed out of her miko garb swiftly and put on her street clothes, 
before grabbing her long black coat from a hook in the wall and leaving 
her bedroom in a brisk jog. She saw that her fellow Sailor Senshi and 
Mamoru were gathered at the torii of the Hikawa Jinja, waiting patiently 
for her.

&quot;All set?&quot; Makoto asked upon Rei&#39;s arrival.

&quot;Ready as ever,&quot; the Fire Senshi said, shrugging her shoulders briefly.

&quot;Then we&#39;re good to go,&quot; Minako said. &quot;So let&#39;s go!&quot;

&quot;Just how are we getting to this suspected youma stronghold anyway?&quot; 
Makoto said as the group trotted down the steps of the shrine.

&quot;Mamoru and I *do* have driver&#39;s licenses,&quot; Michiru informed the 
brunette matter-of-factly.

&quot;And the cars to go with them,&quot; Mamoru added.

&quot;Wait a minute, Michiru. You&#39;re going to drive us?&quot; Minako said with an 
incredulous expression plastered to her face, as if it were the most 
bizarre thing she had ever heard. &quot;I don&#39;t know why, but you driving a 
car is just... just...&quot;

&quot;Strange,&quot; Ami finished for the flabbergasted Senshi of Love.

&quot;Why? Just because Haruka does most of the driving doesn&#39;t mean I never 
do. I simply prefer to let her do so when we&#39;re together,&quot; Michiru 
explained. Seeing the dubious glances the Inner Senshi were shooting one 
another, the Senshi of the Sea frowned a little in irritation. &quot;I *can* 
drive, I assure you!&quot;

&quot;Right...&quot; Minako said carefully. &quot;I&#39;m sure you can. Uhh... I think I&#39;ll 
go in Mamoru&#39;s car though... it&#39;s nothing personal, heh heh...&quot;

In a matter of minutes the Sailor Senshi and the Prince of Earth were at 
the bottom of the Hikawa Jinja&#39;s steps and in front of Mamoru&#39;s and 
Michiru&#39;s --or rather Haruka&#39;s-- parked cars.

&quot;Well... good luck, I guess...&quot; Chibi-Usa said, realising this was the 
time she would be parting ways with the senshi and her future father. 
&quot;Kick some youma butt for me! And don&#39;t worry about Puu or Haruka; you 
have *me* looking after them!&quot; The princess from the future slapped a 
fist to her chest in a version of a salute.

&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want me to come with you...?&quot; Hotaru asked one 
more time, looking glumly at her friend. &quot;The streets can be unsafe 
too...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Chibi-Usa reassured the Senshi of Rebirth. The pink-haired 
girl then shuffled her feet and lowered her gaze to the ground for a 
moment. She then shyly took Hotaru&#39;s pale hands in her own, holding them 
in a delicate grip. &quot;Just... just you be careful too, okay?&quot; Hotaru&#39;s 
cheeks turned pink as Chibi-Usa&#39;s hands held hers, but she managed a 
stiff nod and a small noise in the affirmative as a reply.

Rei turned away from the two young girls and noticed Minako had an 
indulgent look on her features as she observed the cute scene. The Fire 
Senshi rolled her eyes in mild exasperation. The &#39;Goddess of Love&#39; could 
see potential romance just about anywhere. Minako needed a boyfriend, or 
*anyone* really, badly.

&quot;Now that the touching farewells are done, shall we go?&quot; Michiru said 
with restrained smile, which caused both Chibi-Usa and Hotaru to redden 
in embarrassment.

&quot;Yes. We have a job to do,&quot; Usagi said with surprising resolution, 
making a few eyebrows rise.

Rei smiled grimly as she saw the natural leader in her princess manifest 
itself, her love&#39;s blue eyes becoming icy, determined, steel. &quot;That we 
do. And a meeting to attend. Let&#39;s not keep them waiting.&quot; Or *him*, the 
Fire Senshi mentally added. Or her second chance at happiness.
