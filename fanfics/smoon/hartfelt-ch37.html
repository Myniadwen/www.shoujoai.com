<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch36.html">Back to Part 36</a><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p>“So…How did you find 
me?”</p><p>Makoto saw her friend frown. It wasn’t the welcoming smile that she had hoped 
for, but given their circumstances she couldn’t blame her. Even this predicament had her 
stumped.</p><p>“I mean,” Ami continued, “my computer couldn’t locate anything. So how did 
you even know I was here?”</p><p>Makoto looked thoughtful for a moment. “You know...I never 
really thought about that.”</p><p>“Thought about what?”</p><p>“How I found you. I mean, I 
know this is going to sound weird, but... Oh, I don’t really know how to explain it! When I 
came to, I was by the ‘resting site’. The tree was in bloom and… before I knew it I was 
walking. It was like... somehow, I just knew that I needed to come here.”</p><p><i>It was as 
if my body knew where to go.</i></p><p>“And that was when you found me?”</p><p>“Mm.” Makoto 
nodded. She heard her friend sigh.</p><p>“Really, Makoto...Although I’m glad that you found 
me, you should have been more careful. You were about to enter the room before you confirmed 
whether or not it was truly me! What if I was the enemy and it was a trap?”</p><p>“But it 
wasn’t.”</p><p>“That’s not the point! You could have been hurt or worse yet--”</p><p>Ami was 
about to say more, but Makoto held up her hand. “I know, and I’m sorry I worried you...but I 
did check first. I read your aura...AND...As soon as you told me to stop and answer a 
question, you confirmed my suspicions. The enemy wouldn’t have asked me that. Only the real 
Ami would.”</p><p>“Are you sure about that?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“It’s...never mind.” 
<i>Before I encountered those images of our past selves, I would have believed the same 
thing. But our enemy somehow seems to know things that I haven’t told anyone else. That’s 
why... when Makoto answered my question I wasn’t looking for a straight answer. It was the 
type of answer that mattered. She knows the truth, but...</i> “In any case, did you sense 
any of the others on your way here?”</p><p>“No. I haven’t sensed anybody.” She paused. “For 
some reason...I can’t sense them at all. You don’t think...”</p><p>“Although it is a very 
real possibility, I highly doubt it is the reason our senses have turned up nothing. If 
anything else, I think it has something to do with our current surroundings.”</p><p>“Huh? 
What do you mean?”</p><p>“First of all, you have probably noticed how similar the 
surroundings are to your home. I admit, I was somewhat surprised, myself, when I came to, 
but it is impossible that we were teleported back to Jupiter. Neither of us possesses the 
ability nor the strength to do so.”</p><p>“Then… what does it mean? Are we 
dreaming?”</p><p>With that, Ami reached up with a one hand and pinched the taller woman on 
the cheek. “OUCH! …Okaaaay--!!…so it’s NOT a dream…” <i>But you didn’t have to pinch me that 
hard!</i></p><p>“That’s right. As you can see, we are both definitely alive and awake. 
Therefore it cannot be a dream. However, an illusion is an entirely different story.” Ami 
crossed her arms over her chest. “This is only speculation, but… what if we are trapped 
within an enemy’s illusion? Not only do these surroundings defy logic but they are also 
putting us at a disadvantage that would normally not occur. My computer…” she looked down at 
the machine, “…and the suppression of our ability to trace signatures. If we’re ever 
separated then it’s possible that we may never find one another again…”</p><p>“Don’t worry! 
That’ll never happen. We’ll just have to stick to each other like glue.” Makoto confidently 
assured her. “In any case, it sounds like you’ve got it all figured out. We know what we’re 
dealing with, but... the only question now is… what are we going to do about it? Is there 
any way we can get out of here?”</p><p>Ami looked thoughtful. She knew the answer, yet she 
was always hesitant to deliver such dangerous news.</p><p>“Logically speaking, with the 
majority of spells… one’s best chance to overcome the spell is to defeat its caster or the 
source of its power. However this approach requires a direct confrontation, and under these 
circumstances we’re already at a disadvantage.”</p><p>“So, basically...the problem is that 
the spell is an illusion, right? And there’s no telling where our attacker is. Hmm...I mean, 
when you look at it like that it seems kind of strange, don’t you think? If we’re under an 
illusion, then it’s like this is all in our heads. Why haven’t they killed us 
yet?”</p><p>“Wait, what did you just say?”</p><p>“Why they haven’t killed us?”</p><p>“No, 
before that.”</p><p>“Oh. Well...if it was an illusion, then it must be in our heads, 
right?”</p><p>Makoto watched for the longest time as Ami silently thought to herself. She 
didn’t quite understand it, but whatever she just said it must have been really 
important.</p><p>“...It’s not an illusion.” She finally said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It is, 
but not the type we were thinking of! I hadn’t considered it until now, but you just made a 
very good point. In an illusion, we would have to be alive to be under its influence. That 
means...while our minds are under its spell, we would still perceive pain, fear and etc. 
However, if it was simple as that, then we shouldn’t be alive right now...” A sharp looking 
came into her blue eyes. “The key lies in our surroundings.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I still 
quite see what you’re getting at... If it’s not an illusion, then what is 
it?”</p><p>“Something worse,” Ami mumbled. “We’ve been trapped in another 
dimension.”</p><p>Behind her, she could hear her friend gasp. “Wha—But how?! Are you really 
sure about that?”</p><p>“Well...Although I admit I’m not one-hundred percent sure, I am 
fairly certain. As I’ve said, the answer lies in our surroundings. I’ve only read about it, 
but...when a user creates an alternative dimension you would expect that the settings would 
be warped in appearance--because it is a warped piece of space in reality. As you can see, 
this is not the case.”</p><p>Makoto scratched her head. “I don’t want to sound mean, 
but...didn’t you just disprove your theory?”</p><p>“It may seem like it at first...but we 
need to keep in mind that there’s no guarantee that our enemy hasn’t changed its appearance. 
What perturbs me is...how detailed they’ve made it. There’s also the off-chance that they 
are able to read our minds.”</p><p>“...Seriously? Why do you say that?”</p><p>“It’s just a 
hunch.”</p><p>Makoto frowned. She knew that Ami would never say something so serious due to 
a mere hunch. An uneasy silence descended into the hall.</p><p>“Okay... I get it. So we have 
to be careful. But that still doesn’t explain what we have to do. If we’re in another 
dimension, then does that mean our enemy is in here too?”</p><p>“It’s very 
likely.”</p><p>“Then I guess that settles it. If we want to get out of here, we’re going to 
have to fight them!” Makoto said grimly.</p><p>“That’s what worries me.” Ami slowly 
admitted. “If it’s Apollo himself...then...”</p><p><i>If we fight him by ourselves he’ll 
kill us.</i></p><p>Both women locked eyes, bright green meeting blue. Deep down in their 
hearts they knew of the danger that may be awaiting them at the end of this road. If their 
captor was indeed the mighty Sun God, then their chances of survival were bordering on 
nil—such a meeting would be the equivalent of the kiss of death, a promise of eternal 
slumber that would come regardless of how torturous the end. He nearly had them then. What 
difference was there now? Perhaps, whatever miracles they were briefly granted along the way 
did nothing but postpone their cruel fate.</p><p>“I know…” Makoto gently assured her. “But, 
it’s a chance we have to take. Everyone is counting on us! We have to try, no matter what 
happens…” She took Ami’s hands into hers. They felt cold. “Remember? That was the promise we 
made.”</p><p>“<i>For what it’s worth, I didn’t do much either. I couldn’t do anything to 
help any of them… But it doesn’t have to stay that way. There’s still time! We can both help 
each other, okay?” </i></p><p><i>I remember... This is precisely why we wanted to become 
strong in the first place. Not just for our own sakes, but for our friends as 
well.</i></p><p>Ami gently squeezed back. She was afraid of where this would lead them, but 
as long as Makoto was by her side then it was all right. She wasn’t alone 
anymore.</p><p>“The most likely place where we will find our opponent….” She whispered. “…is 
<i>that</i> place. The place with his 
seal.”</p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p><u>(Desert)</u></p><p>The scenery seemed to pass 
them by. The entrance of the palace, the bristling city with its transparent citizens, with 
their booths and ivory towers... They never spared them a glance as they passed, and they 
never looked back. The two women soon reached the city shield’s outer limits and found 
themselves staring out across miles of golden sand. For a moment, they stood there and felt 
the burden upon their shoulders; the uncertainty between was undeniable. To reach the jungle 
bush in the distance, they would have to take that first step and they did.</p><p>Halfway 
through the desert they were caught up in a sandstorm. The wind howled in their ears and 
threw sand into their faces; the angled grains scraped roughly against the unprotected skin 
of their arms and legs left uncovered by their transformation outfits, leaving a series of 
stinging marks. Still, they pushed forwards. Makoto increasingly fought to keep her balance; 
the combination of her heavily weighed footsteps in the unstable ground and the wind blowing 
against her tall frame threatened to topple her over. The green-eyed ruler let out a gasp 
when an abnormally strong gust took her by surprise from behind and threw her forwards. She 
tried to catch herself but ended up rolling down the sand dune. When she finally stopped she 
blindly reached out, calling out Ami’s name, and was thoroughly startled when a hand flew 
out and clasped hers firmly. She tilted her face up to find Ami smiling encouragingly at 
her. The blue-haired Goddess was pointing to something in the distance-- up ahead the splash 
of green could be seen. They were almost there. Makoto blinked once before she smiled as 
well. Hand in hand the two pushed onwards.</p><p>At the edge of the desert, they broke 
through the sandstorm and walked the final stretch to the jungle entrance.</p><p>“Hey Ami…? 
I know this is going to sound really weird, but...where do you think Gods go after they 
die?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I suppose where the other deceased have gone… Why do you 
ask?”</p><p>“I was just thinking… even if Gods can living forever, is it worth it? Is living 
forever worth not going to a place like Heaven?”</p><p><i>Is it? I don’t know…</i></p><p>The 
wind stood its ground relentlessly and the sun continued to bake their fatigued bodies… yet 
despite that, their steps strangely felt lighter.</p><p>“Never mind. Forget I asked. It’s a 
stupid question...”</p><p>Finally they reached the jungle. Reluctantly, Makoto let go of 
Ami’s hand to let her partner step forward in an attempt to scan the area.</p><p><b>Bleep. 
Bleep. Bleep.</b></p><p><b>Tappity-tap, tap, tap!</b></p><p>As Ami proceeded with the 
initial investigation, Makoto cautiously inspected their planned entry point. She had 
noticed it as soon as they had arrived, but she assumed it was merely a figment of her 
imagination due to their time in the ruthless desert; a hallucination brought on by the sun 
and dehydration. However… now that she knelt down and stared intensely at the plants at her 
feet, it was unmistakable. There were trees and shrubs everywhere, covering every inch of 
the jungle ground.</p><p>“It’s gone.” She muttered.</p><p>“What is?”</p><p>“The trail,” she 
pointed. “There was a trail here that led into the heart of the jungle. It was the same one 
we used when you guys came to help me investigate. But now, it’s gone! It’s like it just 
completely vanished!”</p><p>Makoto stepped away from the area and returned to Ami’s side. 
After another minute of silence Ami finally disengaged her system and tucked the machine 
away.</p><p>“Well, what do you think? Did you find anything?”</p><p>“It’s strange…” Makoto 
tilted her head at the comment. “The disappearance of the trail and this interference... 
Logically speaking, under the assumption that this dimension is responsible for the 
interference to my computer’s operations, the closer we become to the source the stronger 
the interference should be. At this point I shouldn’t be able to start my system. But I 
can…and worse yet, the interference here is the same as it was in the palace.”</p><p>“But 
how can that be?” Makoto whispered.</p><p><i>Is the enemy closer than we think? Are they 
watching our every move, even at this second?</i></p><p>She turned to face the desert and 
stared out into the stretch of sand. In memory its presence was still as threatening as 
ever, but in reality it was no more or less than when they had taken it on. Yet, somehow, 
staring at the unending sea of emptiness lit an unexplainable, sudden surge of anger within 
her.</p><p>Startled by the unsettling, fiery emotion within her chest, Makoto ripped her 
gaze away from the sight and turned her back on it completely as a new wave of resentment 
sunk in. The nervous courage she possessed earlier was becoming dangerously fuelled by a 
stronger confidence, one that was pushing away her fears and limitations in the wake of 
brash impulsiveness. Why did she suddenly want to shout at Ami for being so hesitant? Her 
determined green eyes narrowed at the shorter woman, finding that her impatience was 
beginning to slip from her control.</p><p>There was a whisper in the wind. Before her sight, 
there was a dark energy encompassing her friend. ‘Danger’, the word punctuated her 
thoughts.</p><p><i>No! I--What am I thinking?! I trust Ami with my life! </i>Makoto’s eyes 
snapped shut. Forcefully she squashed the upsetting emotions, and allowed reasoning to take 
breathing soon calmed her impulsive bravado until her head was clear again, and she could 
finally think straight.</p><p>“Makoto, are you all right? You look a little out of 
breath...” Ami asked in concern.</p><p>“Y-Yeah… I’m okay.” She shrugged and shook away the 
cold feeling. “I guess… I haven’t quite recovered from our walk in the desert 
yet.”</p><p>Ami abruptly snapped her fingers and Makoto was surprised when a rush of cold 
water hit her from overhead.</p><p><b>Snap!</b></p><p><b>Splash!</b></p><p>“Pfff—Woah! 
C-C-Cold!”</p><p>“How about now...? Do you feel any better?”</p><p>“Yeah... much better 
actually! Thanks, a bunch! I really needed that!” Makoto briefly smiled. “But… what are we 
going to do now? If the interference is the same here, should we even bother with trying to 
get to that place? I mean, even if the trail is gone, I’m sure we could find it if we 
tried.”</p><p>They both stared ahead at the jungle where their path should have been. Long 
weeds and shrubs could trip them at any time, and their enemy could be lurking within the 
darkness or up in the trees. Any mistake could be their last.</p><p>“It’s dark in there,” 
Ami quietly said.</p><p>“…Yeah, but… you’re not alone.” Makoto walked forward a few steps 
and stopped. She then turned around and extended out her hand to the other woman. “I’m right 
here with you. Remember?”</p><p>The gesture in Ami’s eyes reminded her of their childhood 
days, particularly that day on Neptune when she was overwhelmed by fear. Makoto had reached 
out to her then and she still did so now.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p><i>Let’s go 
together.</i></p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p><u>(Jungle)</u></p><p>The cracking of 
breaking twigs and the crunching of leaves along the ground’s floor sounded under their feet 
as they forced their way through the rough vegetation. Undoubtedly, their current hike was 
proving itself to be many times more exhausting than their first excursion through the 
headstrong wilderness; without a trail to guide their way their steps were shaky and unsure, 
and they were continually being scratched by the branches that reached out and attempted to 
block their way. However despite it all, there was one thing that hadn’t changed. The place 
was eerily quiet.</p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p>Ami’s eyes darted left and then right-- 
her acute senses were high on the alert.</p><p><i>That same presence from the palace… It’s 
all around us.</i></p><p>A cool breeze brushed up the back of her neck and sent shivers 
running down the woman’s spine. The leaves were rustling all around them, and the 
temperature was starting to drop. Unconsciously, Ami wondered how her partner was coping 
with all of this; she was walking a few steps in front of her and had been quiet for some 
time now. However, Makoto appeared oblivious to the change of their surroundings. The tall 
woman’s green eyes were darker, and somewhat unfocused. Whispery words crept through the 
trees, weak as echoes, and reached her ears. But what she heard was the heavy thudding of 
footsteps—her entire body felt weighed down and her pulsed raced as if she were the one who 
was running.</p><p>All the while, her vision became dimmer and the path before her blurred 
and warped.</p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p><b>Tup. Tup. 
Tup.</b></p><p>“<i>Jupiter, are you positive this is the right way? It feels like we’ve been 
wandering through this blasted jungle for hours!”</i></p><p><i>Jupiter slowed in his pace 
and came to a halt just ahead of the other man. “Shh…” he gestured.</i></p><p><i>Mercury 
tilted his head in question, but as soon as he caught sight of the structure up ahead his 
earlier irritation vanished. Although its appearance had somewhat deteriorated due to the 
unforgiving ravages of time, the stone arena still bore its distinguishing patterns and the 
engraved insignia of the Sun God, Apollo. They had found it.</i></p><p>“<i>So there it 
is.”</i></p><p>“<i>Wait, Mercury! We should stay away from it until we know it’s 
safe.”</i></p><p>“<i>That’s ridiculous. How do you expect me to analyze it at a distance?” 
The God retorted. “We haven’t got all day to stand around and watch it. The sooner we get 
this over with the better.”</i></p><p><i>Ignoring his friend’s warning, Mercury cautiously 
approached the moss-covered arena and inspected it under a scrutinizing eye. He would often 
tilt his head, either crossing his arms or adapting a thoughtful stance as he circled around 
the dormant structure. At last, Mercury stopped to inspect a particular eroded stone block 
of the arena. It was chipped and somewhat eroded, making it somewhat difficult to read, but 
he could make out the Sun King’s insignia engraved in the stone.</i></p><p><i>His eyes 
flashed.</i></p><p>“<i>Yes. There is no doubt about it. This is it.” He concluded with 
confidence. “It is a good thing that you contacted me before it had the chance to do anymore 
damage.”</i></p><p><i>Jupiter nodded in agreement. “Yes, I think so too. There’s really no 
telling what this thing is truly capable of. What made Ares go mad that 
day…”</i></p><p>“<i>I’m sure his blood-lust was partially to blame. You know how those 
Martians were in the war. They were like blood-thirsty animals. Although I will give Ares 
some credit for doing the right thing, that fool was especially weak willed towards 
destructive activities himself.”</i></p><p>“<i>Mercury…”</i></p><p><i>Jupiter’s words were 
lost on deaf ears when he resumed inspecting the ruin before him. The God knew that once his 
friend had set his mind to something it was very difficult to convince him 
otherwise.</i></p><p>“<i>Hmm… what’s this?” Mercury muttered under his breath. Beneath the 
insignia there was small text that he hadn’t noticed before. As he reached out his hand to 
get a better look at the writing, the symbols began to glow with a golden light—before the 
God could blink, a tiny sphere of light shot out and hit him square in the chest; Mercury 
stumbled back in surprise.</i></p><p>“<i>Oof!”</i></p><p>“<i>Mercury?! Is something wrong?” 
Jupiter went to his friend’s side.</i></p><p>“<i>What...? What in Mercury was that?” The 
shorthaired man mouthed back in shock. For a moment, there was uncertainty flickering in his 
darkened eyes.</i></p><p>“<i>I asked if you were all right. You sudden 
fell!”</i></p><p>“<i>Oh. I-I suppose I momentarily lost my balance…” He mumbled as Jupiter 
helped him up to his feet. “But never mind that. We have still have work to 
do.”</i></p><p>“<i>Yes. Yes, you’re absolutely right. But please keep in mind that although 
the ruin appears to be dormant, it is still dangerous! We must finish this as quickly as 
possible.”</i></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p><b>Tup. Tup. 
Tup.</b></p><p>“Makoto...? Makoto!” Someone was insistently shaking her shoulder from 
behind. Makoto’s lashes briefly fluttered before she turned her head to see who was calling 
her. This time, there was no feeling stirring within her chest as her dark green eyes 
focused on the shorter woman. Her pulse wasn’t racing, and she didn’t even feel a spark of 
overwhelming relief or happiness. She felt nothing.</p><p>The wind had changed.</p><p>“What 
is it?” She asked as she coolly regarded her.</p><p>“W-Where were you going?”</p><p>“What do 
you mean?”</p><p>“I turned my head for a moment and before I knew it, you were walking off 
on your own! Didn’t you hear me? I kept calling to you, but you wouldn’t stop!” Ami grasped 
her hands. “I know this looks like your home, and you think you know where you’re 
going...but please remember...this is still an illusion! We need to stay close, no matter 
what!”</p><p>For a moment Makoto peered around with indifference at her new surroundings. So 
she was in a different part of the jungle then when she had last remembered. So what? She 
peered down at the woman holding her hands tightly. The fear emitting from her was like a 
foul stench.</p><p>The brunette pulled out of her grip was about to push her away when a sob 
reached her ears. For a moment the thought registered.</p><p><i>Did I make her 
cry?</i></p><p>Her eyes flickered, becoming brighter for a second as the desire to comfort 
her blossomed. But like a flower it wilted when her head painfully 
throbbed.</p><p><b>Ba-Dap!</b></p><p><i>Ah!</i></p><p>“Makoto?” For a moment, nothing but 
the rustling leaves could be heard. The shadows created by the overhead sun, which managed 
to filter through the canopy foliage, were being cut and scattered.</p><p>“Stop clinging 
onto me!” Makoto snarled and forcefully pushed Ami away. The shorter woman fell to the 
ground in shock.</p><p>“Don’t you get it yet? Stop clinging onto others so much! What 
happened to your so called desire to become a strong ruler? Just look at you. You can barely 
stand on your own two legs!” She gestured. “No confidence, no courage at all! I never 
imagined you to be this weak-willed. It’s no wonder why others can’t rely on 
you!”</p><p>“Makoto, what are you saying?” Ami asked shakily.</p><p>There was something 
wrong. Something was very wrong. But despite knowing that it didn’t ease the pain of her 
words any less; they stabbed her heart like thousands of prickling thorns.</p><p>“I’m saying 
that you’re a disgr--” Her words trailed off when something ahead of them caught her eye. In 
morbid curiosity, Ami turned to see what distracted had her partner. Her blood instantly ran 
cold; beyond the leaves and branches, further up ahead, was the crumbled ruin of the arena. 
Memories of her last encounter with that place flashed before her eyes like she was about to 
die. ‘Danger’, her mind insistently warned. Ami’s entire body began to tremble 
uncontrollably; the influence leaking out from that place was overpowering.</p><p>Overhead 
the sunlight shifted, filtering through the leaves at a new angle upon their forms and threw 
their shadows onto the ground behind them. The dark form spreading away from Makoto’s feet 
retained its owner’s shape for only a split second before flickering into 
another’s.</p><p>Makoto felt like she was sinking into a fog.</p><p><i>I 
feel…weird…</i></p><p>To Ami’s surprise Makoto suddenly stepped forward, her intentions were 
perfectly clear.</p><p><b>Tup.</b></p><p>“No! What are you thinking? We mustn’t go near it!” 
Ami leapt to her feet and ran around in front of parter, desperately trying to hold her 
back. “Remember, this is a trap! What if Apollo is waiting for us 
there?!”</p><p><b>Tup.</b></p><p>“M-Makoto?! AH!”</p><p>With one strong push, she threw Ami 
aside and brushed past her bruised form as though she didn’t exist.</p><p>“Makoto, wait! 
It’s too danger---” Ami’s words froze in mid-air. Her friend’s glowing black eyes were 
nearly as startling as her expression. For some reason, Makoto looked 
terrified.</p><p><i>...Why does she look so afraid?</i></p><p>‘<b>Are you afraid, Mercury? 
Do you fear for the safety of your beloved daughter?’</b></p><p>“WAIT!”</p><p>Makoto broke 
out into a sprint, and as she did so Ami thought she glimpsed another person’s outline 
running beside her distancing form; a shorthaired man in a suit of armor was running with 
her stride for stride. The flash of Mercury’s insignia on his shoulder plate paralyzed the 
young woman in her tracks.</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>Ami reached out her hand towards the 
retreating back, and felt a strange sensation well up deep inside as Makoto drew further and 
further out of her reach.</p><p><i>Don’t go!</i> She 
mouthed.</p><p><b>CracKle...</b></p><p>She had barely thought the words when a spark of 
green energy erupted around her outstretched hand and disappeared into the air before her. 
Ami instantly jerked her hand back and stared at the palm in question. Her fingertips were 
still tingling from the electric sensation—it really did feel as if she had discharged a 
portion of her aura, but she could see nothing there. There had been a green spark there a 
second ago, hadn’t there?</p><p>The stomping of Makoto’s distant footsteps snapped the young 
woman out of her thoughts, reminding her of their predicament.</p><p><i>I’ve got to stop 
her!</i></p><p><b>Stomp! Crack! Crack! Crunch!</b></p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! 
Tup!</b></p><p><u>(Arena Ruin)</u></p><p>Ami came to an abrupt halt as she entered the area. 
Instantly, the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end and her arms were breaking out 
into goosebumps. But she pushed her discomfort aside for the one person she came here 
for.</p><p>Ami’s blue eyes studied her partner with concern. The man’s transparent outline 
was no longer present, however his presence appeared to have transformed into blue, glowing 
spheres of lights that continued to encircle Makoto’s tall frame.</p><p>“What’s happening?” 
Ami’s eyes widened, and she gasped. <i>That aura… It can’t be!</i></p><p>Makoto stared at 
the arena with serious interest, before she approached it without any warning.</p><p>“Wait! 
Don’t you remember what happened last time?!” Ami cried out to her. She hands clenched into 
tiny fists. She was the only one there who could stop her. She had to stop 
her!</p><p>Suppressing her uncertainties and fears she broke out into a 
run.</p><p><b>“</b><b>What if she was taken away from you? Do you really believe she can 
survive in this world? A shy, delicate little thing, isn’t she…?”</b></p><p>“Don’t do 
it!”</p><p>Makoto reached her hand out to a specific tile on the arena’s side. Her fingers 
dipped below the faded insignia and, slowly, in her own blood she traced a pattern of 
symbols onto the stone. One by one the symbols began to spring to life with a golden 
glow.</p><p>“You don’t know what you’re doing!”</p><p><b>“</b><i><b>You don’t know what 
you’re doing!”</b></i></p><p><b>FLASH!</b></p><p>Makoto leapt back as a golden light erupted 
into the area, filling it with its presence. Though the energy upheld its disguise of purity 
its true intention sprung forth to taint. Orange flames showered down onto the area and 
concentrated towards the borders of the jungle spacing. Meanwhile, the blue orbs circling 
Makoto’s body became erratic during this revelation.</p><p>Amidst the rising flames rose the 
stench of burnt remains. They had been forced to separate but Ami still called out to the 
other woman.</p><p>“…Makoto! Makoto, snap out of it!” She pleaded.</p><p>Indifferent dark 
eyes reflected the light from the licking flames and the barren patch of ground before her, 
but they still did not see the blue-haired woman; inside it was pitch black. She was 
floating in cold, empty, nothingness. Vaguely she recalled that someone should have been by 
her side-- she reached out and felt the cool space--there should have been someone there but 
it was empty. Loneliness… the thought came to mind. A short while ago she hadn’t been 
lonely; someone had visited her, telling her she could sleep now if she wished to. It 
wouldn’t be painful he promised. Although he had reminded her of someone she once knew he 
wasn’t the person that she was missing. And because that person wasn’t there, she could not 
stay there.</p><p>…<i>Makoto! Makoto, snap out of it!</i></p><p>Makoto wearily opened her 
eyes and stared up into the darkness. It was lighter now, and somehow warmer. Was that where 
she should go?</p><p>“Makoto!”</p><p>The dark fog over Makoto’s green eyes dissipated and 
finally reflected the other woman’s image.</p><p>“H-Huh?” Makoto blinked back. She 
instinctively raised a hand to cover her eyes from the blinding light. “Ouch!” <i>Where did 
all this light come from?!</i></p><p>The splash of gold died down, and Makoto’s eyes widened 
in horror; she was met in the face by a surrounding wall of blue flames. Panic hit her to 
the core. She frantically whipped her head to all sides, trying to locate an exit. Yet each 
and every attempt ended with a glaring view of the menacing wall, its flames licking the air 
as though they were hounds about eat in the first time in years.</p><p>‘This—this can’t be 
happening! It’s just an illusion right? It can’t be real! Hah—uhh—It’s not 
real!”</p><p>Stubbornly Makoto glared in determination at the fiery barrier. No matter what 
she would find a way out!</p><p>“Ami!” She spotted her at a distance. “Ami, are you 
all--”</p><p><i>Huh? Why is she looking at me like that?</i></p><p>“...Ami?” Her voice came 
more out timid this time. Why were her eyes regarding her with such worry? Why were they so 
afraid?</p><p>Makoto reached out a hand towards the shorter woman, meaning to comfort her, 
when suddenly her hand jerked back towards her.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Ami stared at Makoto as 
one of the blue orbs began circling rapidly about the woman’s right wrist and began to 
spark. Makoto clasped her left hand over her shaking arm and tried to steady herself as her 
power was being forcefully dragged out of her. Green energy, too, soon joined the blue in a 
maddening spiral of power.</p><p>“Arrrrgh… ah—ahhh… s-stop! STOP IT!” Makoto 
shouted.</p><p><b>Spark-crackle…cRacKle--- FLAAAAAASH!</b></p><p>In that instant the energy 
exploded, and transformed. Within seconds Jupiter’s spear was held firmly in her 
grasp.</p><p>“W-Why…” Makoto narrowed her eyes at the weapon in her hand. <i>But I didn’t 
want to summon it!</i></p><p>The Goddess’s fears skyrocketed when her body suddenly shifted 
into an offensive position on its own accord.</p><p><b>Swiiiiiiiish…kitch.</b></p><p>“H-Hey! 
Stop!” She protested. Makoto viciously began to struggle for dominance over her body, but 
she found that her commands were being overpowered by stronger influence. As she continued 
to helplessly flounder, unknowingly, to her, the transparent outline became visible around 
her form once more.</p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p>“<i>Mercury!” 
Jupiter cried out; his friend had his head in his hands and shook as if he was in pain. 
“Mercury! What’s wrong?”</i></p><p>“<i>Get away from me!” Mercury threw out one of his hands 
from his head and materialized his gun. Without hesitation he unleashed a series of rounds 
at all directions as if fighting an invisible force.</i></p><p>“<i>Get away, get away, get 
away--!” </i><i><b>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! </b></i><i>“GET… AWAY FROM 
ME!”</i></p><p>“<i>Merc---”</i></p><p><i><b>-------zip!</b></i></p><p><i>The last shot 
zipped past Jupiter’s ear and destroyed a section of the jungle behind 
him.</i></p><p><i><b>KABLAAAAM!!!!</b></i></p><p><b>“</b><i><b>What if they were 
all…Dead…?</b></i></p><p>…………………………<i><b>..…………..Dead….</b></i></p><p>…………………………<i><b>..………………………Dead………….”</b></i></p><p>“<i>HYAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!”</i></p><p><b>. 
. .</b></p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p>The outline around Makoto howled in rage. This 
time, the enraged bellow reached Makoto’s ears.</p><p><i>What is that?!</i> Her entire body 
was trembling so badly that she could barely hold onto her 
weapon.</p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p><b>BLAM! BLAM! 
BLAM!</b></p><p><i>Jupiter sidestepped and evaded the oncoming shots, each blast narrowly 
missing their target by precious milliseconds. The sound of exploding stone and wood echoed 
in their wake.</i></p><p><i>Mercury glowered at the elusive God, furiously cursing his poor 
aim under his breath.</i></p><p><b>“…</b><b>Do you really think that you could possibly 
defeat me?”</b></p><p><i>The blue-haired ruler clenched his jaw. A dark shadow behind 
Jupiter superimposed itself over the man’s form and solidified. Mercury’s breathes came out 
in shorter rasps, seething with unrivalled hatred at the mockery presented before him. He 
could barely contain his trembling.</i></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>‘<i>Ugh! 
What…?’</i></p><p><i>A light-headed sensation struck the man head on as the scene before him 
dimmed and darkened. A misty sort of fog surrounded the Sun King’s image; Apollo watched his 
former subject through half-lidded eyes, as if one were looking upon another in fond memory, 
before rising off of the ground just enough so that his feet would no longer touch such 
filth. Then, in one smooth motion, he bowed.</i></p><p><i>Mercury’s entire body tensed. He 
held his breath. Unconsciously, his eyes followed the hand that gestured to the God’s feet. 
He blinked.</i></p><p><b>Fwish!</b></p><p><i>There was a flash of light and the ground was 
suddenly stained by blood. He opened his mouth in a wordless gasp as some trickled towards 
his feet. The mutilated corpses of his comrades lay motionless along the ground, each of 
them having met death’s door unwillingly as displayed in their contorted positions. Ugly… 
their faces still screamed rage even before their blood had run dry. Instead of dying as 
Gods, they had died in the image of vengeful demons.</i></p><p><i>In his horror, Mercury 
quickly sought for his best friend. But the God, unlike the others, became the most twisted 
and hideous of all. Cold, empty eyes glared up accusingly into pained blue one as the air 
grew frigid.</i></p><p>“<i>N-No…!” Mercury impulsively turned to run. But instead of running 
from his fear he came face to face to the one thing that would destroy 
him.</i></p><p>“<i>!”</i></p><p><b>…</b><b>Creeeak…creeeak…</b></p><p>“…<i>Ami…?”</i></p><p><i>The 
little girl that he had left behind in the safety of the palace, where he was positive that 
she would be safe in his absence, hung from a rope attached to an invisible ceiling. There 
was a noose securely wrapped about the girl’s slim neck. Her limp corpse swung slightly, her 
life already claimed and falling away with the crimson liquid dripping from the tips of her 
fingernails.</i></p><p>…<i>A shy girl who had the most precious smile to him was 
gone.</i></p><p>…<i>The one who he wished to protect, who he cherished more than anyone 
else…was...</i></p><p>…<i>gone…</i></p><p>…<i>gone…</i></p><p>…<i>gone…</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>It’s 
a present for you</b><b>.”</b> <i>Apollo softly remarked from behind him, without having 
changed his position. Even at a distance the Sun God could hear the rapid thumping of 
Mercury’s heart. It was a wonderful sound; like a frightened rabbit who was about to die of 
a heart attack.</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>Don’t you like it? Mercury…?”</b></p><p><i>Meanwhile, 
Jupiter gazed upon his friend’s backside warily. The blue-haired man’s fit of rage had 
abruptly died down into still silence, one that was proving to be difficult to read. Was it 
safe to approach him? Had he finally regained his senses?</i></p><p>“<i>Mercury…?” The God 
stepped forward—once—and then twice.</i></p><p><b>Ka-chink</b></p><p><i>No sooner than he 
had uttered the name a gun had been whipped around and aimed at the heart beating within his 
chest. Jupiter’s eyes 
widened.</i></p><p>“<i>DIE.”</i></p><p><b>TUP!</b></p><p><b>BOOOOOM!</b></p><p>“<i>ARRRRRGH----!!!!”</i></p><p><i>Jupiter 
stumbled off balance to the side and fell to one knee. His shoulder armor had been 
obliterated in the blast, leaving behind badly burnt skin.</i></p><p>‘<i>Although I’ve 
somehow managed to avoid the blunt of the shot... How could his power be this strong? This 
armor was especially crafted to withstand against spiritual assaults. Even a God would have 
difficulty damaging it! But to have completely rendered this piece useless and to have 
injured me to this extent with a single shot…’</i></p><p>‘<i>Does he truly wish to kill me 
that badly?’</i></p><p>‘<i>WHY?’</i></p><p><i>Green eyes looked up, searching for 
understanding…</i></p><p>…<i>Hurt…</i></p><p><i>Dark clouded blue eyes sought for 
destruction.</i></p><p>…<i>Murderous intent…</i></p><p><i>The transformation in his best 
friend’s demeanour sent Jupiter’s hopes shattering into irreparable pieces. Before the 
abrupt transformation, he had sensed insecurity and a deep, suffocating fear overcoming his 
friend. He had looked like a spooked animal being driven into a corner, fighting with an 
opponent that only he could see. What had happened? The man glowering at him, with those 
unnatural, lost eyes of his was Mercury and yet it wasn’t.</i></p><p>‘<i>If I don’t do 
something... He’ll kill me.’</i></p><p><b>. . 
.</b></p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p><b>Tup!</b></p><p>Makoto had started 
charging.</p><p><i>D-Damn it! I can’t stop myself!</i></p><p>“Get out of the way Ami!” She 
warned in a panicked voice as her arms drew her spear back for a downward, diagonal strike. 
“I-I can’t control my body!”</p><p>Ami’s mind froze for a split-second at the sight of 
Makoto charging <i>at</i> her. She was aiming to hurt <i>her</i>. The impact of the other’s 
woman’s words registered much slower, convincing her at the last second to try and move. 
Only, she found that she couldn’t. Her legs were frozen to the spot!</p><p><i>What? Why 
can’t I-I can’t move?! My legs-- </i>Frantically Ami reached down with her hands and tried 
to force her limbs to barely glanced up again when Makoto was upon her. The blade gleamed 
menacingly at its zenith before it came down with a crushing blow of delivering 
judgement.</p><p>“<i>DIE.”</i></p><p>“Ami!”</p><p><b>TUP!</b></p><p><b>SLASH!</b></p><p>“Augh!” 
Ami cried out in pain as she crashed shoulder first into the ground, and gasped out in 
forced, choked breaths until she finally rolled to a stop. As she lay there, trembling on 
the hard, barren floor, her mind and body screamed out—mortified at its lack of action in 
the face of danger.</p><p>With a shaky hand, while ignoring Makoto’s yells of concern, she 
gently felt the spreading wetness that was soaking her left shoulder. Ami winced; the cut 
was fairly deep. Without a second thought she instinctively tried to heal it, only to see a 
blue aura already encasing the wound. What should have been a quick process became nothing 
but a fancy display. Her powers were doing nothing. Ami stared incredulously at the wound; 
why were her powers ineffective? She narrowed her eyes, analyzing the blue light. It was her 
power, but—</p><p>She gasped.</p><p><i>This power it isn’t mine. It feels similar to mine, 
but… it’s not me!</i></p><p>With some obvious effort, she heaved herself back up to her fee 
and felt the effects immediately. Her body felt weak due to the accumulation of wounds and 
fatigue, especially now that her wounds refused to heal. Panting for breath, her blue eyes 
re-focused on Makoto. The woman had remained still and watchful from where she had struck 
her friend down.</p><p><i>For some reason I couldn’t move... And then, before I knew it, 
just when I thought it was all over my legs suddenly moved on their own! It’s like… </i>She 
gasped. <i>What if…</i></p><p>“Ami, are you all right?!” The glow of blue light being 
emitted from Makoto’s spear tore Ami’s attention away from the woman, rendering her deaf to 
her friend’s concerns.</p><p><i>That light…</i> Her senses recognized it. <i>It’s the same 
as the one upon my shoulder! But, that presence… </i></p><p>The outline around Makoto 
flickered strongly in the shorter woman’s vision. As Makoto’s body began to pace side to 
side on the spot, the outline steadily became clearer. Ami’s eyes widened as the man’s 
booted feet appeared first. The sounds of his footsteps—Makoto’s footsteps-- crunched loudly 
within her ears. Then his legs, the armor about his waist, his chest and the signature gun 
gripped tightly within his strong hands came into view. Ami’s body furiously trembled, her 
spirit was terribly shaken inside as his face came into 
view.</p><p>“F…”</p><p>…<i>.Father--!!</i></p><p>Ami violently flinched when she met the 
specter’s cold, intense eyes. There was an indescribable depth of fury raging in them. 
<i>Mercury is dead.</i> She had heard the phrase enough times to last her a lifetime. Yet 
seeing his form, standing before her as she remembered him, it was difficult to truly wrap 
her mind around painful truth. Why was he here? Her father had died years ago, he was 
dead—his spirit should be resting peacefully. Had she done something to disgrace the 
prideful ruler, a deed terrible enough to prompt him to possess her best friend to carry out 
her punishment? The wound from her shoulder painfully ached…</p><p>All of these questions 
buzzed around in her mind, dragging her spirit farther and farther into the depths of 
despair. Because it was then that she realized…</p><p><i>He’s not looking at 
me.</i></p><p><b>Lubb Dubb… Lubb Dubb…</b></p><p>Although her father’s clouded eyes burned 
with an intense desire for justice, his pulsing aura around her wound emanated pain and 
sorrow. Ami’s fingertips brushed against the shimmering light. An image of a faceless 
individual, seated upon an invisible throne, was mocking him. Her father was crying 
desperately over someone’s body-- one that she could not clearly make out.</p><p><i>He’s 
fighting someone. Someone powerful.</i> Ami’s desire to run to him and comfort him grew 
stronger. She wished to talk with him despite his aloof demeanour towards her when she was a 
child; at one point he was all she had.</p><p><i>But… I am no longer a child…</i> In the 
vision she saw her father slowly look up from the unmoving person and glowered at the 
laughing being. At the same instant, Makoto’s body tensed; the veins in her head and arms 
became noticeably visible in her attempts to struggle against whatever had possessed 
her.</p><p><i>Oh no--! It’s--It’s going to start again!</i> Her muscles hummed with the 
energy encompassing her form.</p><p>“No…I won’t...!” Makoto hissed through clenched teeth. 
Sparks of her power flared up, momentarily stalling her movements, but her rebellious 
attempts were forcefully crushed by the blue aura surrounding her.</p><p>“AH!”</p><p><i>Why? 
Why can’t I stop this? Something is controlling me...</i> She felt herself straighten up and 
draw her weapon back into an offensive position once more. <i>Am I really that 
weak?</i></p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p>“<i>This shouldn’t be happening…” Jupiter sadly 
remarked. A green light lit between his hands, beginning at one end and extending far up to 
the tip of a gleaming spear. “But I cannot allow you to kill me.”</i></p><p>“<i>She is still 
a child… yet due to our carelessness, because we had believed that the contraptions would 
remain dormant without his presence, this tragedy has occurred! You wouldn’t wish for 
something like that to happen to your own child, would you?”</i></p><p>“<i>You wouldn’t wish 
for something like that to happen to your child, would 
you?”</i></p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p>“<i>For Makoto… I 
cannot.”</i></p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p>“<i>I cannot allow you to kill 
me.”</i></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>“I-Is someone there?! Oh!” Ami was startled when her arm 
abruptly shot out in front of her.</p><p>Instantly she felt the pull on her powers, feeling 
the energy concentrating into the palm of her hand. There was no doubt in her mind of what 
was going to happen next. However, she did nothing to resist it. She sensed it then; deep 
inside, another consciousness was awakening. Its influence over her body was steadily 
growing, gently flowing throughout her limbs as though it were silently requesting for 
permission. There was something pure about its intentions that made it nearly impossible for 
Ami to refuse it control over her body.</p><p><i>This warm light… I’ve felt it before.</i> 
She closed her eyes, sensing the presence out. <i>But from where?</i></p><p>Green spheres of 
light appeared and circled around her form. She could barely make them out.</p><p><i>It 
feels like Makoto’s? </i>Ami’s eyes snapped open and she gasped. <i>Now I remember! I sensed 
the very same presence within that room! </i></p><p>“Ami, it’s starting 
again!”</p><p><i>Then that means…The memories, and that day--!</i></p><p>To the far side of 
the area, Makoto leapt into the beginnings of an offensive rush. Her footsteps started 
slowly as they felt out the appropriate rhythm. Then her momentum steadily began to 
increase.</p><p><i>My father is within Makoto… and… HERS is within me?!</i></p><p>As the 
tall woman closed in, the green spheres surrounding Ami’s body shone brighter. Within a 
brilliantly flash of light the outline of Jupiter emerged and stabilized. His form fell 
partially into the blue-haired woman; her arms became his and her legs stood for him. For a 
time, even her heart and the heartbeat of the deceased God’s were beating in 
synch.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>Amongst the roar of approaching 
footsteps, Jupiter opened his eyes. There was hurt swimming in his beautiful green eyes, but 
the strong sense of commitment in them was overwhelming.</p><p>Makoto, now in a full out 
sprint, had shut her eyes tight in fear of the inevitable. But the mysterious appearance of 
a familiar presence alerted her senses, unconsciously prompting the woman to 
peek.</p><p><i>Geh--!</i> If she had control over herself the sight of the ghostly figure 
would have frozen her to spot! <i>I-I-It’s…</i> She resisted harder, prompting her possessor 
to forcefully draw her weapon back.</p><p>In the face of this challenge, Jupiter’s 
determined green eyes never reflected recognition of the young Goddess charging him. Ami’s 
eyes widened further as she felt her energy drawn into the palm of her hand.</p><p>As Makoto 
leapt up, Jupiter instantly summoned his spear and Ami’s gun 
materialized!</p><p><b>FWOOSH!</b></p><p>“HaaaAAAAAH!”</p><p><b>SLASH---<br>BLAM!!!</b></p><p>Ami’s 
shot had re-directed Makoto’s spear, allowing the shorter girl time to re-create the 
distance between them once more. Her attacking scheme fell into an entirely different rhyme 
that she was unaccustomed to. Yet her body seemed to know how to quickly adapt; each twist 
and turn, the sheer improvement in her evasiveness and accuracy of her shot continued to 
amaze her.</p><p><i>No matter where we went, we couldn’t locate where the source of this 
dimension was… Everywhere we walked, the strength of the foreign presence was the 
same…</i></p><p><b>Blam! Blam! Blam!</b></p><p><b>Slash—Shink! Ting!</b></p><p><i>We 
couldn’t find the casters of the spell because they were inside of us this entire 
time!</i></p><p>Mercury and Jupiter locked eyes.</p><p><i>This is… their 
dimension!</i></p><p><b>Slash!</b></p><p><b>Slash!</b></p><p><b>Slash!</b></p><p><b>SLASH----TIIIIING!</b></p><p>Ami 
break-rolled along the ground as Makoto’s metal blade collided with the fire barrier behind 
her. Even as she broke away she could still feel the flames hotly breathe down her 
back.</p><p><i>If that is true… then in order for us to escape, it is them that we must 
defeat! The only question is...How?</i></p><p><b>SLASH----</b></p><p><b>Tup! 
</b></p><p><b>---Thud.</b></p><p>Ami heard Makoto breath out a sigh of relief at her last 
near miss; the blade dug into the rough ground, barely missing her opponent with thanks to 
the irregularities she had been throwing into the rhythm. But the relief departed with the 
sigh. Anxiety was dramatically increasing within those frightened green eyes. During the 
critical moments in her strike she was able to struggle for a split second and throw it 
slightly off, purposely causing error and buying Ami more time to react. However, Makoto was 
tiring and her possessor was adjusting at an abnormal rate; he pushed her body to become 
faster and closer to their target with each strike.</p><p>“It’s coming horizontal!” Makoto 
shouted out as the blade swept across. Ami ducked, though a few strands of her hair weren’t 
so lucky.</p><p><b>Blam!</b></p><p>The taller woman somersaulted up and backward, 
re-directing the spiritual bullet while mid-flight. However as soon as she landed her body 
lurched forward, as if she nearly stumbled, and charged to hopefully catch her tiring 
opponent off guard.</p><p><b>Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam!</b></p><p>Ami held her weapon up 
defensively, and her eyes became distant. For a second she saw Mercury instead of Makoto. 
The man raised his gun and aimed it at her, his fingers already slowly pulling the trigger. 
The instant she blinked, she saw Makoto charging towards her with the same killer intent. As 
the blade came down, the sound of a gunshot rang in her ears and her body swayed reflexively 
to the right.</p><p>“!”</p><p><b>SLASH---thud.</b></p><p><i>What was that?</i> She evaded as 
Makoto pushed her back. More gunshots rang within her ears each time the blade came down, 
and each and every time her body moved identically to the way the person in her other sight 
did. There was only one particular gunshot she saw her other self counter with a sweep of a 
spear.</p><p>At that direct moment they countered, Ami felt her gun go off. It was as if 
things were starting to click together.</p><p><i>My gun went off exactly when they swing the 
spear? And… every time Makoto swings her weapon I hear a gunshot! Both of our movements--! 
It’s as if they are pre-determined--!</i></p><p>Ami focused harder on the momentarily 
flashes, finding herself able to predict the series of outcomes for each encounter. Her 
movements, Makoto’s, whatever she saw came true between them both.</p><p><i>It’s as if we 
are merely acting something out.</i></p><p>Ami gasped. <i>What day is it?</i> She thought 
back, remembering who her father desired to fight and who he was fighting 
instead…</p><p><i>Is it… just like that time?</i> Ami recalled her last experience on 
Jupiter.</p><p><b>TUP!</b></p><p>Makoto pulled back and her power was beginning to seep out. 
To both combatants surprise a ball of lightning began to form within the palm of her 
hand.</p><p>“Please stop! You aren’t fighting who you think you are!” Ami pleaded. The elder 
Mercury continued to concentrate his power, but Makoto looked up at the sound of her 
voice.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Makoto! It’s Mercury! It’s my father! He’s possessed your body, 
just like yours has done to mine!”</p><p>“W-What?! What are you saying? We’re being 
possessed?” Makoto flinched back as she felt her power drawing near full 
strength.</p><p><i>Then I’m not seeing things after all? My father is possessing Ami? And 
hers is possessing me? But, how can that be? Why would they do such a thing?!</i></p><p>By 
now Ami had already begun charging up for a counter strike as well. She noticed the tears of 
frustration welling up in Makoto’s eyes, and shouted,</p><p>“They are fighting each other! 
It’s the day they both disappeared!” The rest of her words were swallowed up in the howling 
wind.</p><p><i>On that day many years ago, Jupiter and Mercury disappeared. Only my father 
returned alive. The Planetary Council believed at first that The God of War was a factor in 
Jupiter’s untimely demise… However, in truth…</i></p><p>“<i>It’s my fault… It’s all... my 
fault!”</i></p><p><i>If this was how they fought… If we are acting their last fight 
out….</i></p><p>“Ami, I can’t hold it back any longer! HaaaaAAAAAAH!”</p><p><i>One of us… 
will die.</i></p><p>“Sparking…Wide Pressure!”<i><b> “Shine… Aqua 
Illusion!”</b></i></p><p>“Shine… Aqua Illusion!”<i><b> “Sparking… Wide 
Pressure!”</b></i></p><p><b>FWooooooooOOOOOOOOOOSSSSH---KABLAAAAAAM!</b></p><p>Dust clouds 
rose up into the air, intermingling with the heat from the flames. Ami found herself flat on 
her back, coughing and listening to the roar of their fiery captor. Footsteps were 
approaching. She barely flinched when a scratched up hand reached down and held her by the 
throat.</p><p>Blue eyes met green.</p><p><i>My time is up.</i></p><p>Makoto stared down in 
disbelief. Her body had straddled the shorter woman and her hand was threateningly around 
her throat.</p><p>“N-No…” Tears burned her eyes. Her entire body shook. “No. No. No! No! 
NOOOOOO! This can’t be happening! Ami—Ami you have to move! You have to…”</p><p>Her words 
trailed off upon seeing the understanding smile directed up at her. Ami shook her 
head.</p><p>“It has, to be this way… Only one of us… can go on…”</p><p>“Then I’ll die!” No 
sooner had the words left her mouth Makoto’s fighting arm begin to twitch. “NO! Don’t you 
dare---! ARRRRRGH…”</p><p>Ami calmly regarded the blade painstakingly inch its way 
upwards.</p><p><i>You were always there…Always smiling at me…</i></p><p>“Remember… how I 
was… never very good at fighting? I used to hate myself because of it…”</p><p>“<i>Don’t you 
get it yet? Stop clinging onto others so much! What happened to your so called desire to 
become a strong ruler? Just look at you. You can barely stand on your own two legs!” She 
gestured. “No confidence, no courage at all! I never imagined you to be this weak-willed. 
It’s no wonder why others can’t rely on you!”</i></p><p><i>He was right...</i></p><p><i>I am 
weak.</i></p><p><i>I was a coward.</i></p><p><i>I cling to people.</i></p><p><i>.I was 
always wishing that I was a better person. It was all I could do to keep me from losing 
myself.</i></p><p>“…A-Ami…”</p><p>“You told me it didn’t have to be that way... that we 
would work on it together.” She took a shaky breath. “Together… Because of you, I found out 
that my way of fighting was different from everyone else’s. Strategizing and figuring out 
what to do… I felt like I finally belonged. But it looks like this is the last thing I’ll 
ever do.”</p><p>Makoto gripped harder onto the spear, putting all her might into it; still, 
the blade rose up and drew back towards a stabbing pose.</p><p>“Makoto, it’s all right.” 
Reluctantly the taller woman drew her attention away from her task and met Ami’s eyes. 
“Being with you has made me so happy. When I didn’t believe in myself, when I was sad… you 
always tried to cheer me up. I always felt safe when you held my hand. So no matter what 
happens, even if I need to give up my life, so that yours can go on… then… then I’ll be 
happy.”</p><p><i>You have to go on. You can’t forget about the others…</i></p><p>Makoto 
choked back a sob, desperately trying to prevent the tears streaming down her face from 
blurring her vision.</p><p><b>Ka-chik.</b></p><p>The blade’s metal reflected the image of 
the dancing flames. Ami held her breath. Though she told herself that she wouldn’t be 
afraid, she was.</p><p><i>I just wish… that I could have held your hand one last time.</i> 
The pressure around her throat tightened.</p><p>“Ami…wait for me, 
okay?”</p><p>…<i>Makoto…</i></p><p><b>SHRIIIK---KAPOOOSH!!!!</b></p><p><b>S-h-A-T-t-E-R!! 
Tinkle…tinkle…</b></p><p>The entire scenery exploded, returning to the dark void it had 
originated from.</p><p>“<i>Hey Ami…? I know this is going to sound really weird, but...where 
do you think Gods go after they die?”</i></p><p>“<i>I don’t know. I suppose where the other 
deceased have gone… Why do you ask?”</i></p><p>“<i>I was just thinking… even if Gods can 
living forever, is it worth it? Is living forever worth not going to a place like 
Heaven?”</i></p><p><b>Woosh---ting! Ting! TiiIiiiiIIIIiiinnnnng…</b></p><p>A silver coin 
rolled up to and came to a halt at a woman’s foot. Makoto clutched the limp body of her 
friend tightly, lying over Ami’s chest as she lost herself in the tears of loss. Her chest 
hurt. Her heart ached for the one person she swore she would protect.</p><p>Sobs tore 
themselves from her throat until it was raw; she cried out harder, continually crying out 
even after her voice had become hoarse from trying too many times to put into words how she 
felt. And suddenly, she slumped. She didn’t care anymore. Despite Ami’s words, and the 
merciless nagging reminder of her duty, she couldn’t gather the energy to move on. Her body 
went limp, her voice silenced for now, but the tears had yet to stop.</p><p><i>I might as 
well have died…</i></p><p>“I’m so sorry Ami…” She whispered. “If only I had been stronger. 
If only I could be as strong as you…”</p><p>Makoto closed her eyes, and inhaled deeply. She 
expected her senses to be bombarded by the stench of blood, the proof of her 
sin…</p><p>…<i>What? I don’t smell anything.</i> She wondered if she had become so used to 
the smell and could not distinct it any longer.</p><p><b>Lubb Dubb.</b></p><p>Her own heart 
skipped a beat. It couldn’t be…</p><p><b>Lubb Dubb...Lubb Dubb...Lubb 
Dubb...</b></p><p>While there was a heartbeat pounding strongly in her ears, a soft pressure 
from above gently touched her head. Slowly, Makoto lifted up her head and saw open blue 
eyes. The wound was gone and the battlefield had disappeared with it. She wondered whether 
her voice would work for her now…</p><p>“…Ami…?”</p><p>Ami nodded, tears forming in her eyes 
too. She embraced her back whole-heartedly as Makoto flung her arms around her, holding her 
tight.</p><p>“Ami! I--I thought I’d lost you! But you—You idiot! Thank Goddess!!” Her sobs 
were no longer those of pain, but of joy.</p><p>Up above in the black space two spheres of 
light, one of green and one of blue watched over them. Without warning they came together 
and exploded into a shower of shimmering lights, falling over the women and lighting the 
way. A short distance away, a portal opened.</p><p><i>When I think about living forever… I 
think, why am I still living, even today? Without her…I’m nothing. I would die 
too…</i></p><p><i>That’s why...even for Heaven, the price is too much to 
pay.</i></p><p><b><hr></b></p><p><b>Next up in HFD, Ch. 38: Against the Sun: 
Ascension</b></p><p><b>Rei unluckily finds herself marooned in an empty void with Michiru. 
But what should have been an easy-going truce quickly turned into a cold-hearted betrayal. 
</b></p><p><b>Rei gasped as Ami’s gun was blasted into bits. Michiru let the remains fall to 
the ground, appearing to be quite satisfied by the other woman’s 
expression</b>.</p><p><i><b>...No. “Do you even realize what you’ve done?!” 
</b></i></p><p>“<i><b>I do.”</b></i> <b>She was met again by a surprised look.</b> 
<i><b>“However, I believe the occasion called for it. You deserve to be 
destroyed.”</b></i></p><p><b>Between fighting a child-hood friend and her new puppet, will 
the Martian heir even stand a chance?</b></p><p><b>Her adversary, a blazing spirit, emerged 
from the wall of blue flame with Hell’s escorts. Bit by bit, the flames dismissed themselves 
to reveal their mighty Lord-- the right side of the fiery shield extinguished-- a long, 
trailing glint of metal reflected in dark amethyst eyes. Then the mid-section, where the 
proud symbol of Mars lay engraved within the red armor; the nauseous churning in Rei’s 
stomach was elevated by the sadistic smile of the black-haired warrior who challenged her 
now.</b></p><p><i><b>I-It’s 
you…</b></i></p><p><i><b>FWOOOOSH!</b></i></p><p>“<i><b>Ares!”</b></i></p>
