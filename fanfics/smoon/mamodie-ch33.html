with the show!

-Omake Thirty-Three: Goddesses, Senshi and Duelists, Oh My!-

Minako and Makoto came up to the Outer&#39;s mansion, both summoned by their 
communicators by a desperate sounding Setsuna. The thought of an anxious 
Time Senshi was enough to get them to race over to the mansion as 
quickly as possible.

Minako knocked on the door, and was taken aback when a strange-looking 
robot thing opened it. &quot;Um... Hello?&quot; the Senshi of Love muttered.

&quot;Mina-chan!&quot; a disheveled-looking Setsuna cried out as she ran to the 
door and hugged the blonde. The usually elegant-looking woman&#39;s hair 
looked unkempt, and she had dark bags under her eyes. Makoto walked past 
the two into the mansion, stopping to remove her shoes before entering 
the living room.

There were tiny little robots scurrying around everywhere, as well as a 
strange young dark-haired girl holding Chibi Chibi. On the couch she saw 
Sappho of all people, as well as a rather well-endowed woman sitting in 
the poetess&#39; lap. As Setsuna and Minako came up behind her, she turned 
to the Time Senshi.

&quot;Sets-chan?&quot; Makoto began, &quot;Wh... What in the world&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Chibi Usa and Hotaru were babysitting Chibi Chibi, when Small Lady 
decided it would be a good idea to order a pizza...&quot; as she went on to 
explain the rest of the story, Michiru walked in from the kitchen with a 
cup of coffee, her beautiful aqua locks pulled back into a ponytail. She 
was soon enough followed by Haruka, who listened as Setsuna finished her 
story.

&quot;Sets-chan, you look awful.&quot; Minako said.

&quot;Well, I ended up sleeping on the couch last night,&quot; her girlfriend 
explained.

&quot;Really?&quot; the blonde asked, &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; Michiru spoke up, pointing to the Greek and the goddess 
cuddling on the couch, &quot;Those two beat her to her room.&quot;

&quot;Oh my...&quot; Makoto&#39;s voice drifted off, &quot;I hope when this is all over 
you&#39;ll remember to change your sheets.&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Setsuna asked, &quot;When this is all over, I&#39;m fumigating 
the room, after I replace my mattress.&quot;

Haruka walked over through the obstacle course of robots, &quot;Look, we&#39;re 
at a loss here,&quot; she grudgingly admitted, &quot;We&#39;re not sure what to do at 
this point.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you try to get a hold of Ami-chan?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;She&#39;s studying for her medical exams, isn&#39;t she?&quot; Michiru asked between 
sips from her coffee mug.

&quot;Not today,&quot; the Senshi of Lightning answered, &quot;Right now she&#39;s working 
at her summer job. I&#39;ll call her up and get her over right away,&quot; she 
said as she pulled out her communicator.

------

On the front lawn of the Mizuno house, Ami sat at her small stand. A 
sign reading &quot;Psychiatric Help, Fifty Yen&quot; hung from the front of the 
stand, and business today was booming. There was a small line waiting 
for her help, as well as the young man with the long green hair she was 
currently taking care of.

&quot;...So anyways, I wanted to be the prince, and show Anthy something 
eternal by unleashing the power of Dios, but because of these problems 
with my temper I... I ended up abusing her, smacking her and...&quot;

&quot;Hey, Saionji, do you mind?&quot; a man with long red hair said acerbically 
as he stood waiting his turn with Ami, &quot;Your time with the psychiatrist 
ended five minutes ago. Besides, I have way more pressing issues than 
you do; I&#39;m obsessed with wealth and power, and in that stupid Utena 
movie it turned out I was a ghost. To say nothing of my bad childhood 
memories of my adoptive father I never fully dealt with.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; a young, almost effeminate young man with short blue hair said, 
adding, &quot;And I have sibling relationship issues that would make Freud 
cringe. And as for that Utena movie,&quot; he said addressing the red haired 
man in line in front of him, &quot;I didn&#39;t really get it. I mean, sure I was 
in it, but there were parts that just confused the heck out of me.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; The man in front of him asked, &quot;Like what?&quot;

&quot;Like, okay, the beginning where Utena&#39;s sitting in that classroom with 
all the blackboards moving around in weird ways, what was with that?&quot;

&quot;Well, okay Miki, I&#39;ll help you,&quot; the redhead said smugly, &quot;Remember, 
you can&#39;t take anything from the movie at face value. I think that was 
supposed to symbolize the transitory nature of knowledge and...&quot;

&quot;Miki, Touga, do you mind?&quot; Saionji said angrily through gritted teeth 
as he stood up from the chair and faced the two, &quot;I&#39;m here for help, 
damn it! If you two idiots don&#39;t shut up, I&#39;m going to bury my boot up 
both your asses! Besides,&quot; he continued, &quot;If you&#39;d bothered to listen to 
Ikuhara-sempai&#39;s director&#39;s commentary, you&#39;d know he was using that 
whole blackboard scene to let the viewer know they were now entering a 
different type of reality,&quot; he said irritably as he sat back down and 
faced Ami again, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, where were we?&quot;

&quot;Your trouble with controlling your anger and certain tendencies on your 
part towards cruelty,&quot; the Senshi answered.

&quot;Oh yeah, right. Anyways, I...&quot; the sound of a cell phone cut him off as 
Ami pulled her communicator out of her purse and answered it, &quot;Hello? 
Mako-chan, what&#39;s wrong dear? WHAT? Okay, tell Ruka-kun and the others 
I&#39;ll be right over,&quot; she said as she hung up, &quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry about 
this, but there would appear to be an emergency. We&#39;ll continue this 
later,&quot; she said as she got up and ran down the street in the direction 
of the Outers mansion.

&quot;What th... Hey, I&#39;m not done yet!&quot; Saionji yelled after her angrily.

&quot;Way to bogart the time,&quot; Touga said snidely.

&quot;Oh shut up.&quot;

&quot;You know...&quot; Miki said thoughtfully, &quot;While I do acknowledge that what 
the director says is certainly important in a discussion like this, 
since the whole film is an allegory couldn&#39;t that mean that the scene 
could have more than one meaning? I mean maybe it both serves as a way 
of letting us know we&#39;re in another world and of commenting on the 
transitory nature of knowledge.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; Touga said thoughtfully, &quot;So you&#39;d use a phenomenological 
model in regards to The Adolescence of Utena as opposed to a Thomistic 
or Cartesian one?&quot;

&quot;Exactly, I mean...&quot;

&quot;Urgh, you two are giving me a headache,&quot; Saionji said irritably, 
&quot;Although I will admit, I was confused by one or two things in the movie 
as well. Like, okay, the whole thing with the prince.&quot;

&quot;The prince was an archetype,&quot; Touga said.

&quot;Jungian archetype or Joseph Campbell archetype?&quot; Miki asked.

&quot;Well I...&quot;

&quot;No no no,&quot; Saionji interrupted, &quot;Utena said she and Anthy killed the 
prince together, right? But I thought Utena wanted to be the prince, 
didn&#39;t she?&quot;

Both Touga and Miki were silent as they thought about that. Miki began 
to open his mouth, but then closed it as he realized he didn&#39;t have an 
answer. Touga reached into his pocket and pulled out a cell phone, 
quickly dialing a number he&#39;d memorized a while back.

&quot;Hello, Juri? Touga, I... Yeah, right, long time no see. Listen, are you 
busy at the moment? Good, because Miki, Saionji and I are in need of 
some help...&quot;

------

&quot;Okay Chibi Usa,&quot; Ami said as she pulled the future princess aside, 
&quot;Tell me the exact wording of the wish.&quot;

&quot;Well, I told Skuld in regards to Chibi Chibi, &#145;I wish she could have a 
friend like you around all the time.&#39; Then everything became crazy and 
I...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Ami said as she patted the clearly upset teen on the 
head. She then walked past Urd and Sappho as she made her way through 
the many robots in the room over to Skuld, &quot;Hello,&quot; she said to the 
goddess holding Chibi Chibi, &quot;I&#39;m Ami.&quot;

&quot;Skuld,&quot; the young goddess answered as she held her hand out. Ami shook 
it as Chibi Chibi fell asleep on the dark haired young goddess&#39; 
shoulder.

&quot;Skuld, have you tried to talk to your superiors yet? You know, explain 
that this whole thing was a big misunderstanding?&quot;

&quot;I tried, but by then it was too late; the wish was already entered into 
the system.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Ami said thoughtfully as she walked away. She went into the 
kitchen where the others were.

&quot;Well?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Tell me you&#39;ve got a plan,&quot; Haruka said hopefully.

Ami shook her head mournfully, &quot;The wish has been made,&quot; she said, 
&quot;There&#39;s nothing I can think of to break it.&quot;

&quot;You... you mean, we&#39;re stuck like this?&quot; Setsuna asked despairingly. 
Minako quickly took the Time Senshi into her arms to console her as Ami 
pulled her communicator out.

&quot;Who are you calling?&quot; Hotaru asked as she stood next to her 
Michiru-mama.

&quot;This is a problem for all the Senshi,&quot; Ami answered as she dialed a 
number, &quot;Hello? Usagi-chan?&quot;

-A Short Time Later-

&quot;So let me get this straight,&quot; Mamoru said as he drove his car with 
Usagi sitting in the passenger seat, &quot;Chibi Usa tried to order a pizza, 
and got a goddess instead?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Usagi said, &quot;Ami sounded pretty troubled by it, and...&quot; the 
future queen of Neo-Tokyo was cut off by Mamoru&#39;s chuckling, &quot;What&#39;s so 
funny?&quot;

&quot;Well, she thought with her stomach, and a disaster resulted. She&#39;s 
definitely your daughter,&quot; he laughed.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Usagi whined, &quot;Stop picking on me! Besides, this is serious.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mamoru said as he reached over to rub his fianc&eacute;e&#39;s 
shoulder consolingly, &quot;Now, tell me again why we have to pick Rei up at 
the shrine?&quot;

&quot;Because her car&#39;s in the shop, and it&#39;ll be quicker than if she waited 
for a bus.&quot; Usagi answered as Mamoru drove around a curb, the two 
driving by Ami&#39;s house on their way to the shrine. Outside Ami&#39;s house, 
a strange meeting was taking place...

------

&quot;Okay, look,&quot; the dashingly beautiful Arisugawa Juri said, &quot;I can&#39;t stay 
long, the Locket&#39;s going to be opening in a few hours. Anyways, I think 
she said she and Anthy killed the prince because, by entering the real 
world together, they ended the fairytale, making the prince no longer 
necessary. Yes, Utena did want to be a prince, but that was before, when 
they were still living in the safety of the make-believe world of the 
school grounds and...&quot;

&quot;The butterfly thing,&quot; Touga murmured.

Juri and the others looked at him funny, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I 
didn&#39;t quite catch...&quot;

&quot;The butterfly thing, okay,&quot; Touga said louder, &quot;What was with the whole 
Shiori turning into a butterfly thing in the cabbage patch? You know... 
When I lost my innocence to my adoptive father,&quot; he said uncomfortably.

&quot;Well, um...&quot; Miki stuttered out.

&quot;I thought she was more of a moth in that scene than a butterfly,&quot; Juri 
answered.

&quot;In the movie, you&#39;re already dead before it begins,&quot; Saionji reminded, 
&quot;Well, there&#39;s actually two of you in the movie. There&#39;s the Touga made 
up of Utena&#39;s memories, and the Touga made up of Shiori&#39;s memories.&quot;

&quot;That still doesn&#39;t explain the butterfly thing,&quot; the redheaded young 
man pointed out.

The four former duelists stood out on the sidewalk in front of the 
psychiatry stand in silence for several minutes as they struggled with 
that. Finally, Juri took out her cell phone.

&quot;Hello, Utena?&quot; the orange haired beauty said, &quot;It&#39;s Juri, I... I&#39;m 
fine. Listen; are you and Anthy busy?&quot;

-Meanwhile-

&quot;Mamoru,&quot; Rei said angrily from the back seat of the car, &quot;That&#39;s just 
mean, making fun of Usagi like that!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mamoru asked, &quot;What are you talking about? You put her down all 
the time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tease her, sure, to get her to see where she&#39;s wrong and try to 
act more mature, but I wouldn&#39;t make a joke about her and Chibi Usa like 
that. That&#39;s just insulting to both her and your future daughter.&quot;

Usagi smiled a bit as her friend tried to defend her, &quot;Thanks Rei,&quot; she 
said gratefully.

Rei nodded as she muttered, &quot;If you were mine, I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t 
treat you like that.&quot; Unknown to the raven-haired Senshi, Usagi heard 
her.

Mamoru parked his car in front of the Outer&#39;s Mansion, and the group 
went in. Their eyes widened in shock at the chaos going on in the house. 
Haruka came out and motioned for the three to join her and the others in 
the kitchen. Weaving their way past the robots, the three walked past 
the couch where Sappho was whispering something into Urd&#39;s ear that 
caused the goddess to giggle like a school girl.

In the kitchen, a small council of war was taking place.

&quot;Beer?&quot; Haruka asked Mamoru, who nodded. She quickly passed him a 
bottle.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Michiru said, &quot;I want those robots, those two goddesses and that 
Greek out of my house now!&quot;

&quot;Michiru-mama?&quot; Hotaru asked, &quot;I thought you were a fan of Sappho&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;That was before she and that Urd woman went at it like rabbits in the 
room next to mine!&quot; she growled, &quot;Your Haruka-papa and I didn&#39;t get a 
wink of sleep last night!&quot;

Just then the doorbell rang. The Senshi in the room all looked nervously 
over to the front door.

&quot;Not another...&quot; Setsuna began.

&quot;Calm down,&quot; Rei spoke up, &quot;I&#39;ll go see who it is,&quot; she said as she left 
the kitchen and made her way through the living room to answer the door. 
Opening it, she saw a pleasant-looking young woman on the other side.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she said, &quot;Have you seen my sisters Urd and Skuld, I...&quot; her 
voice died away as she saw the tiny robots running around the room and 
Urd on the couch sitting on a strange woman&#39;s lap, &quot;Skuld!&quot; she yelled 
out, &quot;Get out here!&quot;

The Senshi in the kitchen looked into the living room as Skuld came out 
with Chibi Chibi in her arms, &quot;Belldandy!&quot; the little sister said 
cheerfully, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Look at all this,&quot; the goddess gently scolded, &quot;You&#39;re a guest here, 
did you get anyone&#39;s permission to make all these bots?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Well... No... But I...&quot;

&quot;You dismantle them all this instant young lady,&quot; she said, watching as 
her younger sister hung her head and left the room, the robots following 
her single file. Belldandy then went over to Urd, grabbing the goddess 
by the earlobe and pulling her painfully off Sappho&#39;s lap, &quot;And you,&quot; 
she said, &quot;It&#39;s your fault Skuld&#39;s stuck in this mess. Go back to the 
temple and come up with something to help her.&quot;

&quot;Ow, okay!&quot; Urd said as she held her now sore ear. She proceeded to 
disappear into the TV. As the Senshi emerged from the kitchen, Belldandy 
bowed to them.

&quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry if my sisters have been an annoyance,&quot; she said as 
the Outers all breathed a sigh of relief that someone had shown up 
capable of bringing some order.

Usagi meanwhile was focused on Rei, who was standing on the other side 
of the room. Rei&#39;s words kept going through her head, &quot;If you were 
mine...&quot; She felt a strange stirring inside her heart, but was unsure 
what to make of it. She then looked over to Mamoru, who was sitting down 
in a chair as he set his beer on the coffee table in front of him, and 
frowned sadly when she realized she didn&#39;t feel the same stirrings for 
him.

-Elsewhere, Outside Ami&#39;s House-

&quot;...Then why call me and Anthy?&quot; Utena asked the group of former 
duelists, &quot;Why not ask Shiori why she turned into a butterfly?&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; Juri admitted, &quot;It would be a bit... awkward for me to call 
her.&quot;

&quot;Besides, you know Shiori,&quot; Miki added, &quot;If we admitted to her we needed 
help to understand the movie, she&#39;d never let us live it down.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; the pink-haired duelist conceded, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s see... 
Before there&#39;s a butterfly, there&#39;s a caterpillar, right? Okay, then 
there&#39;s the cocoon, and finally the adult stage. Now, in the scene where 
you lost your innocence, the butterfly could represent your transition 
from innocent child to the darker power-hungry person you&#39;d become. 
Power which you may have hoped would offer you protection and insulation 
from your childhood traumas.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Anthy spoke up, &quot;I thought she turned into a butterfly as a 
sort of foreshadowing of our emergence into the real world and our 
escaping the cocoon of the academy. After all, she was naked in that 
scene, and you and I were naked as we entered into the real world.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Miki said thoughtfully, &quot;In both cases the nudity could be seen 
as a symbol of rebirth...&quot;

&quot;Or a return to innocence,&quot; Juri quickly put in.

&quot;Urgh, this is RIDICULOUS!&quot; Saionji cried out as he held the sides of 
his head, &quot;How in the hell could the lot of us star in a movie about 
ourselves and have no idea what the fuck any of it meant?&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Touga said shaking his head, &quot;Shiori turns into a butterfly, 
then turns into a car to chase Utena who also turned into a car.&quot;

&quot;Exactly!&quot; Saionji shouted, &quot;What was the whole deal with the car thing? 
And the castle was a gargantuan big rig?&quot;

&quot;Well, okay,&quot; Juri spoke up, &quot;The car represents freedom...&quot;

&quot;And then there&#39;s the idea of Utena being the vehicle through which I 
gain my freedom from Ohtori,&quot; Anthy added.

&quot;But wait,&quot; Miki suddenly said with a frightened look in his eyes, 
&quot;Since everything in the film is some sort of a metaphor, what if the 
love you and Utena feel for one another is also a metaphor?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Utena asked.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Touga said, &quot;Think about it; what if you and Anthy aren&#39;t really 
lesbians? What if the whole kiss scene at the end was just a metaphor 
for something else?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous!&quot; Utena said angrily, &quot;It was the love we discovered 
for one another that gave us the courage to leave Ohtori!&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Saionji said, &quot;Or maybe that&#39;s just the way you&#39;ve chosen to 
interpret it.&quot;

Utena looked at the young man silently for a few seconds before quickly 
reaching into her pocket for her cell phone...

------

&quot;Good news,&quot; Urd said as she came back out of the television carrying a 
chemical beaker with a strange green liquid in it, &quot;I think this will 
solve at least some of our problems.&quot; She said as she poured some of the 
substance into a small spoon and gave it to Chibi Chibi. The toddler 
suddenly started to glow bright white as she began to grow, eventually 
transforming into a thirteen-year old.

Skuld smiled as she saw the youngster. Chibi Chibi was quite attractive 
as a young teen, and the young goddess looked from her over to her older 
sister.

&quot;Urd,&quot; she said happily, &quot;She&#39;s... Beautiful. You actually came up with 
a spell that didn&#39;t foul up somehow, I...&quot;

&quot;Chibi chibi,&quot; the curvaceous young teen said, &quot;Chibi chibi.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Chibi Usa groaned.

&quot;She still has the mind of a two-year old,&quot; Mamoru said.

&quot;(sigh) Oh well, back to the drawing board,&quot; Urd said as she re-entered 
the TV. Just then, Michiru&#39;s phone rang.

&quot;Hello? Who? Oh, Utena,&quot; the artist said, &quot;Yes, I remember you; from the 
Locket, right? What, now? Well sure, I remember Ruka and I saying for 
you to come over anytime, but...&quot;

Knock! Knock!

Hotaru went to answer the door, and a small Ohtori Academy reunion came 
into the mansion.

&quot;...I mean, think about it,&quot; Miki said, &quot;In the show, Utena&#39;s hair was 
long, and Anthy&#39;s was short. But at the beginning of the movie, it&#39;s 
reversed.&quot;

&quot;Okay, now you&#39;re just looking for things that aren&#39;t even important,&quot; 
Touga answered as he looked at the group of Senshi and goddesses in 
front of him, &quot;Good grief, what is this?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; Saionji spoke up, &quot;That blonde chick in the pony tails 
over there is the star of that stupid Sailor Moon show. I saw maybe 
three episodes of the thing before it drove me into a rage and I ended 
up throwing the TV out my campus window. All she does is whine and do 
clumsy crap and whine and eat and whine and...&quot;

&quot;Okay!&quot; Usagi shouted as Juri, Utena and Anthy entered behind the three 
men, &quot;We get the idea; you hated the show!&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t that bad,&quot; Miki said to Saionji, &quot;The series does get better 
later on.&quot;

As Juri and the other two women walked over to Michiru and Haruka, 
Makoto gave Ami a weird look.

&quot;Ami-chan?&quot; she asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Why aren&#39;t you enforcing the whole 
&#145;fourth wall&#39; thing like you usually do?&quot;

&quot;She can&#39;t,&quot; Miki spoke up, &quot;Because I&#39;m talking at the moment.&quot;

Everyone in the room looked at the blue-haired young man with a puzzled 
expression.

&quot;Come again?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;We both share the same voice actress, Aya Hisakawa. I...&quot; he was cut 
off as both Saionji and Touga began to snicker.

&quot;You&#39;re seiyu is a girl?&quot; Touga managed to get out.

&quot;My... My god!&quot; Saionji laughed, &quot;I knew you weren&#39;t the most masculine 
guy in the world, but still...&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Skuld said angrily as she put Chibi Chibi down and stalked 
forward, &quot;Leave him alone, or else!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Touga asked, &quot;What difference is it to you?&quot;

&quot;Hisakawa-sempai did my voice in the OVA and the Ah! My Goddess movie, 
that&#39;s what!&quot; the testy goddess answered.

&quot;So wait,&quot; Makoto said as she turned to Ami, &quot;Doesn&#39;t that mean you were 
kind of talking to yourself when you were talking to Skuld earlier?&quot;

Before Ami could answer, Saionji spoke up, &quot;I don&#39;t care how talented 
the chick is, it still makes Miki look like a creampuff to have a girl 
as his seiyu,&quot; he said as he wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes.

Skuld narrowed her eyes angrily as she whipped out one of her Skuld 
Bombs.

&quot;Skuld!&quot; Belldandy said sharply, &quot;Put that down; we&#39;re guests in someone 
else&#39;s house.&quot;

Once again the Outers smiled cheerfully at Belldandy&#39;s welcome influence 
over her sisters. Skuld grudgingly put the bomb down on the coffee table 
next to Mamoru&#39;s drink as she crossed her arms and sulked. Michiru and 
Haruka then turned to Utena, Anthy and Juri.

&quot;Sorry things are a bit weird around here today,&quot; Haruka offered, 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Utena began nervously, not sure how to express what was 
happening.

&quot;They&#39;re not sure if they&#39;re really in love, or if they&#39;re love is 
simply an allegory,&quot; Juri said for her friends.

&quot;What?&quot; Michiru asked disbelievingly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Anthy said, &quot;You see, we were all trying to figure out the movie 
we were in, and Miki brought up the point that, since everything in the 
film was symbolic, then maybe Utena and I aren&#39;t really lesbians, but 
only kissed at the end of the film to symbolize something else.&quot;

&quot;Well... Wait, why ask us?&quot; Haruka asked.

&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Utena asked, &quot;You two are the poster girls for anime 
lesbianism.&quot;

&quot;If anyone can help, it&#39;s you two.&quot; Anthy put in.

Sappho, sitting nearby, heard the entire conversation. She got up, and 
made her way to the other side of the room, where another conversation 
was taking place.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Usagi said hesitantly, &quot;What... What you said back in the car. 
You know, about if you and I were together... Rei, do you have some sort 
of feelings for me?&quot;

Rei looked into her friends eyes sadly, &quot;Even if I did, what could ever 
come of it? Your engaged to Mamoru, remember?&quot;

As the two friends gazed upon each other mournfully, Sappho walked away, 
her mind starting to work out a plan.

Meanwhile, Saionji, Touga and Miki were all standing near Mamoru.

&quot;So wait...&quot; Saionji said, &quot;You&#39;re trying to say the whole series was a 
dream?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Touga said, &quot;Anthy&#39;s dream. She became stuck in the dream, 
though, and couldn&#39;t wake up, so the duels began to see who could wake 
her.&quot;

&quot;Where did you come up with that interpretation?&quot; Miki asked.

&quot;Well, I...&quot;

&quot;AAARGH!&quot; Mamoru shouted as everyone in the room turned their attention 
to him, &quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; he said angrily, &quot;Look, in case you jerks hadn&#39;t 
noticed, we&#39;re in the middle of a god damned omake here! Not only are 
you dragging this chapter down, but you&#39;re all morons for starring in a 
movie that you don&#39;t even understand!&quot;

&quot;Now see here!&quot; Saionji said angrily.

&quot;Mamo-chan,&quot; Usagi said, &quot;there&#39;s no cause for...&quot;

&quot;Look, this is a Sailor Moon parody,&quot; Mamoru interrupted, &quot;Sailor Moon, 
not Utena! So why don&#39;t the lot of you take a flying leap into someone 
else&#39;s story,&quot; he said snidely as he reached for his beer on the coffee 
table. Unfortunately, not paying attention to what he was doing, he 
ended up grabbing the Skuld bomb instead, hitting the ignition device 
when he brought it up to his lips.

-KA-THOOM!-

As everyone looked in stunned silence at the remains of Mamoru that were 
smoking on the now demolished chair, Urd came out of the TV again with 
another chemical beaker. Ignoring the carnage in the room, she walked 
over to the now teenage Chibi Chibi and gave her the liquid to drink.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; the girl said, &quot;That tasted good, I... Hey, I&#39;m grown up now!&quot; 
Chibi Chibi said cheerfully as she and Skuld proceeded to eye one 
another. At that time, someone let out a loud whistle, and everyone&#39;s 
attention was turned to the Greek in the leather jacket.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Sappho said as she walked over to Utena and Anthy, &quot;I heard the 
two of you earlier. Utena, if I hit Anthy here in the face, what would 
you do?&quot;

The pink-haired duelist narrowed her eyes, &quot;I&#39;d make you pay for it,&quot; 
she threatened.

&quot;And,&quot; Sappho continued, &quot;What if I kissed her?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d beat you to within an inch of your life,&quot; Utena growled.

&quot;Well,&quot; the poetess said with a smile, &quot;That sounds a lot like love to 
me.&quot;

Utena&#39;s eyes widened. She turned to Anthy, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, 
&quot;I should never have doubted my love for you.&quot;

&quot;Or mine for you,&quot; Anthy said as she rushed into Utena&#39;s arms. Sappho 
then turned and made her way over to Rei and Usagi.

&quot;And as for you two,&quot; she said, &quot;Usagi, your fianc&eacute;e is gone. I can see 
the looks of longing you and Rei have been giving one another. There&#39;s 
nothing to stop the two of you now.&quot;

Usagi looked over to Rei, and smiled. Rei smiled back tearfully as she 
took the blonde in her arms and kissed her.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Urd said as she came up to the poetess, &quot;I&#39;m impressed.&quot;

&quot;Heyyyy,&quot; Sappho said as she stuck her thumbs up in the air, &quot;I&#39;m the 
Sappho, remember?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Arisugawa Juri said, &quot;Now that that&#39;s all taken care of, we&#39;d 
better leave before we overstay our welcome,&quot; and with that, she and the 
other Ohtori alumni left the Outer&#39;s mansion.&quot;

&quot;And speaking of overstaying their welcomes,&quot; Setsuna said, &quot;Sappho, I 
think it&#39;s way past time for you to return to ancient Greece.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; the poetess said dejectedly. She then turned to Urd, &quot;You 
coming along?&quot;

Urd turned to her sisters, &quot;Belldandy, Skuld? Would you mind?&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Belldandy answered, &quot;Just remember to stop by and visit 
once in a while.&quot;

Urd smiled cheerfully as she hugged her fellow goddesses and entered the 
timegate with Sappho and Setsuna.

&quot;Well wait a second,&quot; Chibi Chibi said, &quot;What happens now to Skuld and 
me?&quot;

&quot;Well, there&#39;s plenty of room at the temple now that Urd has gone to 
ancient Greece,&quot; Belldandy said, &quot;The two of you can come back with me, 
and these nice lesbians can have their house back.&quot;

&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Skuld said as she and Chibi Chibi left out the 
front door.

&quot;We have the house back!&quot; Michiru shouted joyously as she hugged Haruka. 
Setsuna likewise hugged Minako happily as the Inners slowly began to 
filter out of the mansion.

&quot;Well,&quot; Rei said as she walked off hand in hand with Usagi, &quot;Now that 
we&#39;re officially dating, what do you want to do first?&quot;

&quot;Whatever you want, my love,&quot; Usagi smiled as she drew Rei into a kiss.

End Notes: Dedicated to everyone out there who saw The Adolescence of 
Utena the first time and went &quot;w.t.f.&quot;, but especially to Sawayuri Akira 
over at shoujoai dot com for starting a conversation a short time back 
about confusing aspects of the Revolutionary Girl Utena movie, and 
Kripfto for supplying most of the answers. It got me to thinking; what 
if the characters themselves were just as confused as some of us are?</pre>
