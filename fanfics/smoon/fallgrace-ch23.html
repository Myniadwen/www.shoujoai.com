<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Hotaru looked around the crowded ballroom before straightening her black 
dress. Where was she?

&quot;Hey! Hotaru!&quot;

With a smile on her lips, the young woman turned to find Megumi making 
her way over to her, dressed in a cute black skirt and white blouse.

&quot;Megumi, what took you so long?&quot;

The brunette flashed her friend a winning smile before pulling the 
shorter girl into a tight hug. Hotaru paused, surprised, before wrapping 
her arms around the other girl.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to see you out.&quot;

&quot;I have you, Sara and Hikari to thank.&quot;

Megumi pulled back, her eyes unusually soft and a smile on her lips. It 
faded when she saw a black choker around her friend&#39;s neck and felt the 
gravity of the situation of that night hit her.

&quot;Hotaru...&quot;

The violet-eyed girl followed her friend&#39;s gaze and a hand moved 
instinctively to her neck. Her eyes glazed over at the reminder of a 
certain woman as she sobered.

&quot;Why?&quot;

Hotaru shook her head, clearing her mind of the painful memories before 
focusing o the confused expression on her friend&#39;s pretty face. She 
plastered on a grin.

&quot;Hey, you&#39;ve known for a while now. Besides, I thought you of all people 
would support my decision. You never did seem to like her.&quot;

&quot;Hey! Megumi and Hotaru, over here!&quot;

The two turned to the sound of Sara&#39;s voice to find her and Hikari 
making their way over. The blonde wore an off the shoulder white dress 
that fell just above her knees, summer sandals on her feet and a white 
purse on her arm. The other arm was wrapped around Hikari&#39;s waist.

Hotaru had to say they looked great together, her tall brunette friend 
looking adorable and a bit butch in a silk, black men&#39;s suit vest and a 
pair of black pinstriped dress pants. Her crisp white blouse made it 
seem like she and Sara had planned the whole thing.

&quot;What took you two so long?&quot;

Sara giggled as she hugged her black-haired friend, an excuse dying on 
her lips when she saw the black choker. She never expected Hotaru to 
actually have taken it off. Megumi shook her head meaningfully.

&quot;Well, Sara didn&#39;t like what I was going to wear,&quot; Hikari said softly 
with a blush.

&quot;She did a good job correcting you,&quot; Hotaru teased, smiling when her 
tall friend&#39;s blush deepened.

&quot;Enough with the yapping,&quot; Megumi drawled. &quot;Where have you two been?&quot;

&quot;Getting Sara&#39;s stuff, she&#39;s sleeping over tonight.&quot;

The violet-eyed girl grinned wickedly. Sleep, right.

&quot;The school&#39;s never had the spring benefit here,&quot; the blonde of the 
group said suddenly, looking around the huge ballroom.

&quot;I wonder who booked it,&quot; Hotaru murmured.

Hikari noticed the guilty look on Megumi&#39;s face, but knew better than to 
ask. Maybe later.

&quot;So, when&#39;s this thing officially starting?&quot;

The taller of the two brunettes looked at the program in her hand, 
blushing softly when her crush placed a hand over hers to angle it so 
that she could see as well.

&quot;At nine, with a song performed by... it doesn&#39;t say, actually.&quot;

&quot;Weird,&quot; Sara mumbled.

Megumi shrugged and herded the group over to the refreshment table.

&quot;I need a drink.&quot;

Hotaru stuck close to her friends, feeling self-conscious in her dress. 
The spaghetti straps that held up her dress showed off her ivory skin 
and slim shoulders while the velvet hugged her curves. A few crystals 
dotted her bosom, drawing the attention of a couple of guys as she 
walked by. She was glad the dress went all the way down to the floor, 
bellowing out at the knees.

&quot;Megumi, don&#39;t get drunk,&quot; Sara warned with a sigh as the shorter girl 
grabbed a flute of champagne.

&quot;No worries, I don&#39;t get drunk, remember?&quot;

Hotaru snorted softly while Hikari just smiled wearily and shook her 
head.

&quot;Where are Haruka-san and Michiru-san, by the way?&quot; the quietest of the 
four asked, looking around.

&quot;They&#39;re here... somewhere.&quot;

Sara handed Hotaru and Hikari each a flute, but not before taking a sip 
of the tall brunette&#39;s since the blonde didn&#39;t take one for herself. The 
violet-eyed woman smiled at the cuteness of the sight.

Suddenly, the lights dimmed and everyone looked around in confusion. A 
familiar sound floated through the ballroom, a piano. A spotlight was 
shone on the stage and Hotaru turned to find Haruka sitting behind a 
grand piano.

&quot;What the-&quot;

That&#39;s when Hotaru saw her.

Rei stood on stage, the spotlight making her hair gleam like silk as the 
long locks cascaded down her back. A black dress, similar to her own, 
clung to her curvy body. Hotaru swallowed, her mind instantly comparing 
the miko to the beautiful lounge singers popular in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s. 
The dress was elegant, though sexy on Rei, baring her shoulders and 
elegant neck.

She was absolutely breathtaking as she stood there, tall and confident 
with that smug little smile on her full lips.

The college student snapped out of her daze when she remembered that she 
was currently at the annual fundraiser for her school, a place where the 
beautiful woman should not be. What was she doing here? And what was 
Haruka doing up there with her.

&quot;Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Annual Spring 
Fundraiser for Tokyo University.&quot;

Applause sounded around the room. Hotaru looked around to find her three 
friends by her and a very nervous Megumi fidgeting.

&quot;I was given the honor of opening the festivities tonight, because my 
partners and I were able to contribute by providing this ballroom for 
the night, and I thank the University for giving me this chance.&quot;

Another round of applause. Well, that certainly answers the violet-eyed 
girl&#39;s question from earlier. But what exactly was Rei doing here 
anyway?

&quot;I would like to begin by performing a piece that was written for me by 
a good friend of mine, Minako Aino.&quot;

The students that were present went crazy with applause and Hotaru felt 
her chest tighten. The blonde that was the root of the problem.

&quot;I am very lucky to have the talented Haruka Tenoh and Michiru Kaioh 
accompany me tonight.&quot;

Rei swallowed and snuck a glance at the woman she was trying to win 
back, who was searching the room for, she guessed, her mentioned 
guardian.

&quot;I&#39;d like to dedicate this song to a lovely young woman, whom I&#39;ve hurt 
deeply.&quot;

Purple eyes met and Hotaru was swallowed by the sincerity she saw in her 
love&#39;s lavender orbs. The miko didn&#39;t break their eye contact as she 
spoke, afraid that she&#39;d lose the young woman again.

&quot;I hope this song tells you just how sorry I am... and just how I feel 
about you.&quot;

Rei took a step back, and nodded to Haruka, who started playing at the 
cue. The raven-haired woman tried to calm her speeding heart and took a 
deep breath, preparing herself. This would be her last chance at winning 
Hotaru back. She licked her lips, placing a hand to steady the 
microphone as she sent up a silent prayer to her gods.

&quot;Come up to meet you, tell you I&#39;m sorry.

You don&#39;t know how lovely you are.&quot;

The miko tried not to stare at the young woman whom she&#39;d wronged, 
though it was taking a far greater effort than she had energy for at the 
moment. It was taking all her self-control not to jump off the stage, 
run to the stunning girl and hold her till the world came undone.

But she couldn&#39;t. Because she knew by the betrayed look in those 
beautiful violet eyes that she wasn&#39;t ready for that and maybe never be. 
It all depended on this and Rei felt her palms sweat at the thought.

&quot;I had to find you,

Tell you I need you,

Tell you I set you apart.&quot;

Hotaru could neither believe her eyes nor her ears. Was Rei really 
saying what she thinks she&#39;s saying? If so, the young woman couldn&#39;t be 
sure whether or not she believed the miko.

It&#39;s hard not to remember what had happened, to ignore how hurt she 
felt. She had given everything she had to offer to the woman on the 
stage, who took it all with what seemed to her like love at the time. 
She had thought that everything would be all right once the miko 
responded, but she was wrong. She never expected Minako&#39;s name to be 
whispered after they had made love.

But it had, which meant Rei hadn&#39;t been ready for a new relationship. 
She turned out to be just another girl to replace of the blonde in Rei&#39;s 
bed. So, could she believe these words now? Could that much change in so 
little time?

&quot;Tell me your secrets,

And ask me your questions.

Oh, let&#39;s go back to the start.&quot;

&#39;I&#39;m sorry,&#39; Rei whispered in her mind, eyes pleading with Hotaru. &#39;I&#39;m 
sorry for everything I&#39;ve done. I&#39;m sorry for not telling you 
everything, for never showing you what I&#39;m really like on the inside. 
I&#39;ve never allowed you to see into me, not the way that you let me see 
you.

&#39;I&#39;m ready now. Ready to tell you and show you everything that I keep 
inside. Can&#39;t we start over, Hotaru? Won&#39;t you give me another chance to 
show you who I am?&#39;

Another light illuminated the stage, letting the audience see Minako 
Aino&#39;s personal guitar player. He played a few chords before another 
light came on beside him to reveal Michiru Kaioh herself playing the 
bass.

&quot;Running in circles,

Coming up tails,

Heads on a silence apart.&quot;

It was true, Hotaru realized dimly. It always turned out to be the same 
in the end. One of them would offer up their heart for the other to see 
what would happen. Up to now, it had always been her. She was the one to 
bare her soul, to open up her entire being. This time, it was Rei, the 
woman she loved, and knew she will always love. A part of her thought 
that it was about time.

She had always been the one with everything to lose while Rei remained 
perfectly safe. She had taken a leap of faith, only to have the miko let 
her fall. This time, it was the older woman&#39;s turn to take a leap and 
her turn to decide.

&quot;Nobody said it was easy.

It&#39;s such a shame for us to part.&quot;

Rei knew that love was never perfect. It had its ups and downs, its 
problems and its pain. It didn&#39;t always work out, but she hoped 
desperately this time it would.

The miko smiled as she recalled their little &quot;adventure&quot; in cleaning. 
She had been woken early in the morning, though fortunately not at dawn, 
to start the complicated task. Hotaru had assigned her to kitchen duty 
while she cleaned and organized the living room. Needless to say, it had 
taken the owner of the apartment almost two hours to clean out her 
refrigerator, wash a month worth of dishes and to get all the dust off 
the many plates that she hadn&#39;t touched in ages.

By the time she was done and ready to take a well-deserved rest, she 
entered the living room to find it absolutely spotless, with a coffee 
table that she hadn&#39;t see the glass of in days clean enough to eat off 
of. Her little slave driver was standing smugly at the balcony doors 
with a huge grin on her pretty face and a gleam in her eyes. Before she 
could even sit down, she was ordered to clean her room.

Feeling like a five year old again and grumbling under her breath, Rei 
remember trudging into the room and taking a look around. It hadn&#39;t been 
that messy, since she rarely did anything beside sleep, sometimes with 
other people, in the room. All she needed to do was sweep the floor and 
tidy up a bit here or there.

By the time she was done, Hotaru had already cleaned the bathroom, 
placed all her magazines in a bookshelf she kept especially for that 
purpose and organized her study. The miko remember being in utter shock, 
trying to figure out if her houseguest was even human. She finally 
figured the cleaning obsession came from living with Setsuna and 
Michiru. Actually, she knew a bit like Haruka, forced to clean.

At the end of the day, they were both, or at least Rei was, utterly 
exhausted. Being exhausted and lazy made eating out an easy choice. So 
the two of them showered and changed before heading to a nice little 
restaurant nearby that the miko visited if she had a night to herself.

They sat in a booth in the back, away from prying eyes, and shared a 
simple, but delicious dinner. They had talked about anything that came 
to mind, from music to movies to embarrassing moments. Rei couldn&#39;t 
remember enjoying any of her dates as much as those few hours with 
Hotaru.

&quot;Nobody said it was easy,

No one ever said it would be this hard.&quot;

Hotaru could remember all those fairytales and bedtime stories from her 
childhood where the prince would ride in on a beautiful white horse and 
rescue the damsel. Then, of course they&#39;d live happily ever after. But 
happily ever after didn&#39;t exist in the real world. The reality was... 
love came with pain, grief, hurt and betrayal as much as rainbows, 
giggling and that warm fuzzy feeling you get whenever you&#39;re with that 
special someone.

Only with heartache can one know what good times are, and tears made the 
worth of laughter all the greater. Love was meant to be bumpy, meant to 
be difficult, or else it wouldn&#39;t be special.

&quot;Oh, take me back to the start.&quot;

Perhaps they could just wipe the slate clean and start all over again. 
Start over without the secrets and be open with each other. But that all 
depended on one thing, whether or not Hotaru could forgive and forget.

&quot;I was just guessing,

At numbers and figures,

Pulling your puzzles apart.&quot;

Rei Hino could deny it all she wanted, but what she felt for Hotaru was 
greater than anything she&#39;d ever felt for Minako. The star had rescued 
her from hopelessness while Hotaru had rescued her from her worse enemy, 
herself.

She used to wonder, years ago, back when Hotaru was still a little girl, 
what she would be like when she grew up. She wondered if she&#39;d be quiet 
like before. Or maybe outgoing under Haruka&#39;s tutelage. It was even 
possible that Hotaru would be like Usagi.

But she also wondered what kind of person she would love. Rei had picked 
a handsome, quiet but brilliant young man for the toddler&#39;s perfect 
partner. Surprisingly, she fell for her. And Rei Hino possessed none of 
those three qualities. And she was definitely not a man.

&quot;Questions of science,

Science and progress,

Do not speak as loud as my heart.&quot;

Hotaru Tomoe grew up to be somewhat of an enigma. She hadn&#39;t changed 
much, though she was more outgoing. She wasn&#39;t as shy as before, willing 
to stand up for her beliefs and convictions. She was intelligent and 
observant. She knew when to listen and exactly what to say.

She was also the last type of person the miko thought would be a good 
partner for her. Hotaru was too quiet, too sweet and far too introverted 
for her tastes. Ru seemed like she needed someone that could protect 
her. Someone that would understand her needs without saying a single 
word... someone that knew when to let her fly free.

Rei Hino could do none of the above and was the opposite in almost every 
way. She was overprotective but too broken to look out for someone else 
when it came down to the important things. She was intuitive, which 
being a miko trained her to be, but she always needed to be told what 
someone needed after her fallout with Minako. And being as 
overprotective as she was, she would always want to keep her safe.

But Hotaru was exactly what she needed.

Hotaru Tomoe was loving without being overbearing, knowing exactly when 
to express her feelings and when to let them speak for themselves. She 
was caring and kind, nursing her (even if she was tricked into it) when 
she was sick and confronting her about her habits, in her own way. She 
was a good listener but always knew the right things to say to sooth a 
tattered pride or calm a raging storm. She never judged and was fair to 
everyone about everything.

Then there were the little insignificant things. Like the way she&#39;d 
brush her hand against Rei&#39;s when the miko was upset. Then there&#39;s how 
her smiles reminded Rei of sunshine after the rain. There were also the 
looks Hotaru gave her when their eyes met... a brief twinkle in those 
violet depths or a gleam of mischief. And let&#39;s not forget the most 
important thing, her secretive and innocent laugh, determined to be such 
after having a few drinks and calling a certain couple while they were 
otherwise engaged.

&quot;Tell me you love me.

Come back and haunt me.

Oh, and I rush to the start.&quot;

Rei wanted nothing more than to have the young woman in her arms again, 
to feel her small body mold perfectly into hers and to feel her warmth 
wrap her in a blanket of security. She wanted to hear Hotaru whisper 
that she loved her again, even if it&#39;d be the last time.

If it didn&#39;t work out, if the violet-eyed woman didn&#39;t forgive her, the 
miko would accept it without a word. She didn&#39;t have the right to do 
anything more than to beg for a chance and if she&#39;s rejected, then she&#39;d 
done all she was entitled to do and nothing more. She refused to cling 
this time to something that would never be. Something that she&#39; lost 
because of her own stupidity.

But she&#39;ll always remember the times they shared. The weeks she spent 
with Hotaru Tomoe were some of the best in her life, as important to her 
as her years with Minako. She didn&#39;t want to forget them and if she 
could, she would to carry them with her to the grave.

She may need Hotaru back, but she wouldn&#39;t force her. If the young woman 
does forgive her, then she&#39;d be the lucky person on Earth. If not, then 
she deserved as much.

&quot;Running in circles,

Chasing our tails,

Coming back as we are.&quot;

Rei Hino was baring her soul on stage and Hotaru understood it all. In 
essence, she had done the same thing in front of her, but for two very 
different reasons.

She had revealed her feelings on her own accord, because she needed to 
get it off her chest. Rei was doing it because she had to in order to 
get something she wanted. Her.

Only problem was, did she believe her? What could have caused the miko 
to change her mind so quickly? She still wanted Minako only a week 
before and now was telling Hotaru that she wanted her? Needed her even?

Could she trust Rei again?

&quot;Nobody said it was easy.

Oh, it&#39;s such a shame for us to part.

Nobody said it was easy.

No one ever said it would be so hard.&quot;

&#39;Fool me once,&#39; Hotaru thought as she closed her eyes, &#39;shame on me. 
Fool me twice...&#39;

&quot;Shame on me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going back to the start...&quot;

Rei closed her eyes as the spotlight on her dimmed and the ballroom 
echoed with applause. When the lights turned back on, the miko&#39;s 
lavender eyes searched for Hotaru. But found the spot where she stood 
only seconds ago empty. Her heart wrenched painfully in her chest. She&#39;d 
failed. She&#39;d lost what was most important to her.

Haruka stood and placed an arm around her friend&#39;s slim waist. She 
wasn&#39;t surprised when the defeated looking woman leaned against her for 
support as she led her off the stage.

Rei was shocked when she felt tears well up in he eyes. She thought she 
had no more to shed. She thought she&#39;d cried them all when Minako left 
her and then Hotaru had done the same. Looked like she was wrong, as she 
has been so many times.

The blonde pianist looked desperately at Minako, who shrugged helplessly 
from the balcony as her eyes scanned for a sign of the missing girl.

The tears fell as the miko buried her face in her friend&#39;s tuxedo 
jacket, which caused a pair of strong arms to wrap tightly around her 
trembling form. She didn&#39;t hear the hurried steps that approached them.

&quot;H-Haruka-san! Rei-san!&quot;

The racer looked up to see Sara run up to them, panting and wheezing. 
She arched a brow.

&quot;Rei! Hotaru wants you to meet her in the garden!&quot;

Lavender eyes snapped open as the businesswoman turned to stare at the 
grinning college student. The tears stopped.

&quot;Are... are you serious?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

Rei stood still, unable to believe what she&#39;d just been told. Hotaru 
wanted to see her? There was still a chance then! It wasn&#39;t too late.

&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; Haruka asked, wiping the tears from the 
miko&#39;s cheek with a handkerchief.

Rei smiled and ran off in the direction of the garden, but not before 
pulling the two blondes with her into a tight hug. Then, she was gone.

Sara smiled as she walked back to where Hikari waited for her. Together, 
the two watched the exit through the double doors.

&quot;Hopefully this will have a happy ending,&quot; the taller of the two said 
quietly.

&quot;Of course it will. Hotaru and Rei-san deserve to be together.&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot;

The blonde looked at her friend in confusion.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I know you like Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; exclaimed a very alarmed Sara.

&quot;No use denying it. You&#39;ve liked her for ages. I... I like you a lot, 
Sara. But I knew you&#39;d never go out with me if Hotaru were still 
available. Now will you consider it?&quot;

The blonde shook her head, looking angrier than Hikari expected. She 
also looked quite shocked, to say the least.

&quot;You idiot,&quot; she whispered before storming off.

The brunette, left behind, stared at Megumi, who was standing nearby. 
She was surprised when her shorter friend shook her head as well, a look 
of disbelief and exasperation on her face.

&quot;You idiot,&quot; Megumi echoed before walking away.

-------------------

Rei was nervous as she stepped into the garden. For good reason, though. 
She was given another chance to fix her huge mistake.

Her eyes looked around, trying to find the young woman whom she knew she 
loved. Her nose detected her before she saw her. Without hesitation, she 
walked in the direction of the familiar scent.

Hotaru stared at the small waterfall before her, hands fidgeting. She 
could feel the miko approach and her anxiety grew.

The lavender-eyed woman stopped when she saw her friend&#39;s back. She said 
nothing nor did she make a noise, waiting patiently for the other woman 
to acknowledge her presence.

Hotaru took a deep breath and turned around, a small smile on her lips. 
Rei blew her away again with how divine she looked in that dress. Her 
hair faded into the darkness, as did her outfit, leaving only creamy 
skin where exposed and her face easily seen in the surrounding darkness.

&quot;You look beautiful.&quot;

The compliment brought the shorter girl back to the present and the 
moment at hand. Once the statement was processed, she blushed.

&quot;Thank you. You look great, too.&quot;

The two fell silent. The night air was alive with the calls of insects 
and buzzing with promises of what could be. But at the same time, it was 
strangely tranquil. No matter how the night ended, it was a few 
beginning for the both of them. For two people that at one point thought 
they even had futures, this knowledge was Rei steeled her nerves. She 
was the one that made a mess of things, she should be the one to start 
talking. But seeing Hotaru, being only a few feet away from her... all 
the words left her.

&quot;Rei...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

The college student stiffened, not expecting that of all things.

&quot;I know I messed up,&quot; continued the miko softly. &quot;I messed up bad and I 
didn&#39;t even know it. I would not have done it if I had been conscious.&quot;

Hotaru felt her heart sink. If she had been conscious. Damn it, that 
meant she really did still love Minako. Her heart broke a little bit 
more.

&quot;But maybe it was a good thing I whispered Minako&#39;s name.&quot;

Shock and hurt coursed through the younger girl, forcing her to look at 
the woman speaking. Rei had a wistful smile on her lips, her eyes dim 
with regret and a kind of bitterness.

&quot;It meant I wasn&#39;t as ready to love you as I thought.&quot;

Hotaru felt the familiar feeling of heartache return. Why was she doing 
this to her all over again? Hadn&#39;t she hurt her enough? She turned 
around, unable to deal with that the woman she loved was telling her.

&quot;I thought I severed all ties with Minako. I was wrong. After you left, 
I thought long and hard about who I was. And I realized there was one 
bit of unfinished business I had to attend to before I gave myself 
completely to you.&quot;

Rei wrapped her arms around the violet-eyed girl&#39;s waist from behind 
after closing the distance in a few strides. At first, the youngest 
senshi&#39;s body was stiff, but it soon relaxed under the warmth that came 
from the businesswoman. Both of them relished in how perfect this felt, 
the two of them touching and the beauty of the night.

Then, as if by magic, one by one glowing lights surrounded them. The two 
stared at the fireflies in a daze as they hovered above the trees, on 
the flowers and in the air.

&quot;I finally get it, Hotaru. You can love more than one person in your 
life. The past doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s the past. The memories Minako and I 
made when we were together were some of the best in life, but that&#39;s all 
they are... memories.&quot;

The smaller of the two placed a hand over the one resting on her 
stomach. God, this felt so right.

&quot;I messed up, badly. But I can never forget Minako and I don&#39;t want to. 
I can&#39;t expect you to forget those that you&#39;ve been with and I don&#39;t 
want you to either. All that matters is who you&#39;re with in the present.&quot;

Rei turned Hotaru around to find tears in her large, violet eyes. She 
took the woman&#39;s face in her hands, her voice as soft as a lover&#39;s 
caress and as sweet as a first kiss.

&quot;Give me another chance? Please? Because you&#39;re the one I want to be 
with, I get that now. You&#39;re the one I love.&quot;

The question lingered in the air, the fireflies stopped flying, landing 
all around the two with their lights ablaze. Everything stopped for that 
single moment and all the world hushed as she awaited the answer.

Rei tried to ignore the dread bubbling inside of her. She prayed to 
every deity she knew of. Please, just this once.

Without a single word, Hotaru leaned up and touched her lips to the 
awaiting miko&#39;s. She stared into the shocked lavender eyes for a split 
second, happy beyond words that the eyes she loved brightened and filled 
with love. Her own closed as she smiled, only one thought on her mind.

Rei&#39;s eyes were filled with love for her, and that&#39;s all that mattered.
