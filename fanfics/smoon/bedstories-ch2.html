&quot;Mommy, I want a story.&quot;

&quot;A story!  I love to tell stories.  Once upon a time there was a 
beautiful blonde princess....&quot;

&quot;No, Mommy!  I want to hear a different story.  Tell me a story 
about Auntie Ami and Auntie Makoto.  They told me about when they 
first met, but I think I fell asleep just at the good part.&quot;

&quot;Ami and Makoto?  Hmmph.  Well, ok I guess.  Let&#39;s see....&quot;

&quot;When did you figure out that they were in love, Mommy?&quot;

&quot;Well, one day Mommy and her friends were sitting in the temple 
having tea....&quot;

------- 
&quot;Awwww, c&#39;mon you guys.... it will be a lot of fun.&quot;

For the better part of a week, Minako had been bugging the rest 
of the senshi to have a &#39;girls night out&#39;.  While no one really 
opposed this suggestion (It had been ages since they&#39;d done such 
a thing), her particular idea had aroused considerably less 
interest and support: Karaoke.  Using her finely honed warrior 
skills, Minako decided to focus her assault upon the most 
vulnerable, and simultaneously, the most critical point.  

&quot;Usaaaagiiiiiii, you&#39;re the Moon Princess.  Order them to come 
along with us.  I&#39;ll sing a duet with you.  Any song you want!&quot;
Usagi&#39;s blue eyes tightened as she considered the offer.  

&quot;Hmmmm... anything? Even that song by that hunky new boy band 
from Kyoto?&quot;

&quot;Usagi!  Won&#39;t you ever grow up!,&quot; Rei yelled.  &quot;We&#39;re in college 
now.  You&#39;re too old to be listening to those insipid boy bands!&quot;

&quot;Like those moldy oldies you listen to are worth singing, Rei&quot; 
Usagi replied. &quot;I agree with Minako, we all need some time 
together and karaoke will be fun!&quot;

Glaring at Rei, she added quietly, &quot;Even if some of us couldn&#39;t 
carry a tune in a bucket.&quot;

&quot;Ooooo, just you wait and see, &#39;princess&#39;.  I&#39;m in!&quot;  Rei said, 
banging the table and, perhaps not accidentally, spilling some 
tea on Usagi.

While Usagi and Rei relived their teenage years by engaging in 
one of their famous brawl/tantrums, and Minako struggled to 
prevent the destruction of the tea set, Makoto and Ami shared a 
smile.  Leaning over, Makoto whispered in Ami&#39;s ear, &quot;Do you want 
to stop them, or should I?  Or should we just let them get it out 
of their systems?&quot;  &#39;She smells so nice, like a mountain stream 
on a crisp spring day,&quot; Makoto thought as she paused ever so 
briefly before pulling her head back.

Ami raised her hand to her mouth, to stifle a giggle.  She hoped 
that Makoto didn&#39;t notice the tremble, or that sudden shiver in 
her shoulders.  &quot;I think I can stop them,&quot; she said with a sly 
smile.  Raising her voice, Ami announced, &quot;After thinking it 
over, I agree that karaoke will be a wonderful way for us to 
spend some time together.  I had the most interesting class last 
semester on sociology and we did an entire unit on the role of 
music in society.  I&#39;d love to see if some of the items we 
discussed apply in our modern society.&quot;

&quot;Aaaaammmiiiii, you&#39;re making our night out sound like a study 
session,&quot; Usagi moaned, disengaging herself from Rei and sitting 
back at the table as if nothing unusual had occurred.  (For 
indeed, nothing had.)

&quot;Yeah, Aims, we want to sing, not do a research paper,&quot; Rei 
agreed.  &quot;And if we go, you have to sing too.  The last time we 
went, you didn&#39;t sing even one song.&quot;

Ami blushed, &quot;I suppose it would not be fair for me not to sing.  
Maybe I can join one of you on stage.&quot;

Makoto smiled, &quot;I think I could handle that.  We can do back up 
for Usagi or Mina.  Well, I&#39;ve gotta get going.  See ya!&quot;  Makoto 
rose to leave, but paused at the door.  &quot;Hey Aims, I thought you 
had to get home early tonight to study.  Want me to walk you 
home?&quot;

&quot;Oh dear, I&#39;d lost track of the time,&quot; Ami replied, gathering her 
things. &quot;Thank you, Mako, that would be fun!&quot;

As the two of them left, Minako turned to her soon-to-be co-
conspirators and said, &quot;See?  Do you believe me now?&quot;
-----------------------------

&quot;....and so, later that day, we made some plans.&quot;

&quot;Mommy, you mean Auntie Mina figured it out first?  I thought you 
were the Moon Princess.  Why didn&#39;t you guess?&quot;

&quot;Well, she IS the Senshi of Love, dear, and I was...distracted.. 
by your father. She may have noticed first, but what happened 
later was all my idea.&quot;

------------------------------
&quot;Usagi, they sat about 3 inches apart, they never took their eyes 
off each other, and when they left they were all but holding 
hands.  Haven&#39;t you wondered why Ami spends so much time over at 
Makoto&#39;s?  I know that she&#39;s lonely since her mom moved to 
Germany, but they might as well go buy a condo together they&#39;re
together so often.  Why are you having a problem seeing what is 
right in front of you!&quot;  Rei shouted.

&quot;But if they were... that way...&quot;

&quot;The word is &#39;lesbian&#39;, meatball head.  I&#39;d think you&#39;d have 
picked it up after we finally explained to you about Haruka and 
Michiru,&quot; Rei interrupted.

&quot;I know that, Rei,&quot; Usagi replied pointedly.  &quot;As I was saying, 
if they were, then why wouldn&#39;t they tell us.  They know that 
we&#39;ll always love them no matter what.&quot;

Minako sighed.  &quot;That&#39;s the thing, Usagi.  I don&#39;t think THEY 
know it yet.  Makoto is really only happy when Ami is around, but 
even then, she&#39;s still got all of those defenses up.  Haven&#39;t you 
noticed that the only times she mentions her old sempai are when 
one of us catches her staring at Ami, or when Ami notices?&quot;

&quot;Poor Ami!&quot;  Usagi whined.  &quot;No wonder she always seems so sad.  
Considering how freaked out she got over those love letters, I 
can&#39;t imagine she&#39;d ever get the nerve to say anything to another 
girl.  No wonder she studies so hard.&quot;

Rei bashed Usagi on the head with a pillow.  &quot;Crying about it 
isn&#39;t going to help our friends!  What are we going to do about 
it?  Should we talk to them?&quot;

&quot;Can you imagine?&quot;  Minako laughed.  &quot;&#39;Hey Ami, I couldn&#39;t help 
noticing that every time Makoto is nearby you blush and stammer 
even as you move closer and closer to her.  Heck girl, I think 
she likes you too!  You should go for it.&#39;  The poor thing would 
implode from the embarrassment.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and Makoto would either knock my block off or start 
drooling over the next guy that walked by just to avoid the 
issue,&quot; Rei agreed.

As Rei and Minako chuckled over the mental images they&#39;d 
constructed, Usagi frowned and bit her lip, deep in thought.  
Slowly, a smile crossed her face.  &quot;I think I&#39;ve got it, but 
we&#39;ll have to work together.  First, neither of you can sing with 
them tomorrow night...&quot;
-------------------------------

As Rei and Usagi mismatched yet another attempt at harmony, 
Makoto winced. Minako had been right, though.  This was a fun 
night.  Makoto couldn&#39;t remember the last time all five of them 
had gone out together.  The superiority of her cooking to the 
food in Usagi&#39;s residence hall assured her of at least one visit
a week from the moon princess, but Rei was more and more 
preoccupied with business at her temple, espeically since her 
grandfather had passed on last season.  Minako didn&#39;t enjoy the 
food in her residence hall any more than Usagi did, but not being 
bound to one man by fate meant that she had a lot more boys
buying her meals.  Sometimes Makoto wondered if Minako had paid 
for any food or any drink since starting college.  And Ami, well 
since Ami lived alone now too, it only made sense that they spend 
a lot of time together.  Makoto sighed wistfully and turned her 
attention back to the &#39;music&#39;.

They announced Minako&#39;s name as Rei and Usagi sat back down.  As 
the young blonde left toward the stage, Rei turned to Ami, 
snapping her fingers in front of her eyes.  &quot;Mars to Mercury, 
come in Mercury!&quot;  she laughed.  &quot;What&#39;s up, Aims?  Worried about 
singing in public?&quot;

&quot;No, Rei, I was just thinking about something.&quot;

At first, it had been hard when her mom had left.  Ami understood 
intellectually how important this opportunity was to her mother.  
She also knew that she could never leave Tokyo, though perhaps 
she didn&#39;t know exactly why that was.  It had been hard, at 
first, but having such wonderful friends had made it easier.  
Especially Makoto.  She made excellent sandwiches, and other 
foods as well and seemed to enjoy feeding her.  Dinners together 
had lengthened till now they spent most evenings together 
studying, watching TV, or just sitting together chatting.  All in 
all, Ami had been quite content with the way things had worked 
out.  It was quite a shock, therefore, when she received her 
first grade that semester: a B+ on a political science essay.  It 
was all Makoto&#39;s fault of course; keeping her up talking till 
late in the night, insisting on going shopping on the weekends, 
making meals that took both hands to eat and required her 
presence at the dining room table.  Sandwiches eaten over the 
sink made much more sense while studying!

&quot;Still,&quot; Ami reflected, &quot;the last few months have been a lot of 
fun.&quot;  As she pondered, Ami realized something new.  She felt 
different inside.  Something that previously she had only felt in 
brief bursts, usually after saving the day with her friends, had 
now taken up permanent residence inside her.  She felt light, 
free.  &quot;Oh my.  Has it been so long....that I&#39;d forgotten what it 
is like to be happy?&quot;  She looked over to Makoto, hoping that the 
dim light in the club would hide the blush she could feel on her 
cheek.  &quot;I only feel this way when you are near, Mako-chan,&quot; she 
thought.  Though she knew that was a strange thought, it made Ami 
feel kind of warm and safe, so she let it linger.

&quot;Ami, I&#39;m losing you again!&quot;  Rei shouted, poking Ami in the 
side.  &quot;Mina is finishing up and I think Usagi is next.&quot;  Rei 
crossed her arms and pointed to Ami with a wicked smile.  &quot;And 
that means you!&quot;

Usagi simply watched Ami.  During Minako&#39;s entire song, Ami&#39;s 
eyes had not left Makoto.  Usagi doubted Ami had even heard Rei 
speak.  The longing in those blue eyes almost brought a tear to 
her own.  &quot;There are more important things than school, Ami.  
Please realize that for yourself, before its too late.  Please 
let this work the way I&#39;ve hoped.&quot;  

Usagi rose, clapping and hooting for her friend. Turning, she 
extended hands toward Makoto and Ami.  &quot;Ok, ladies.  This is it. 
You promised to sing and I&#39;m holding you to it.  Now come on!&quot;
&quot;But what are we going to sing, Usagi?&quot;  Makoto asked with 
puzzled smile.  &quot;You&#39;ve been so secretive about it.  If you&#39;d 
given me some warning I could have practiced or something.  I 
know my lousy voice is going to ruin your song.&quot;

Rei and Minako exchanged glances and burst into laughter.  &quot;As if 
anyone&#39;s voice could out-lousy meatball head&#39;s cackling!&quot;  Rei 
snorted.

&quot;I think you all have beautiful voices,&quot; Ami said quietly. 
&quot;Especially you, Mako.  You will do just fine, I am certain.  I 
will try not to ruin it for the two of you.&quot;

&quot;Oh hush now and come on, its our turn!&quot;  Usagi grabbed them both 
and dragged them to the front of the stage.  &quot;Its an American 
song, just read the words and sing along.&quot;
---------------------------

&quot;Momma, Daddy says your English is so bad that you never got more 
than a 48 on a test in school.  How did you sing a song in 
English?&quot;

&quot;Songs are different, sweetie, and I did too do better than that 
in school! He said that, did he? I think your Daddy has some 
explaining to do!&quot;

&quot;What does all this have to do with them knowing they loved each 
other?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m getting to it, if you&#39;ll just let me finish!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t yell at me, meatball head mommy!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that!  Anyway, the three of us went up to 
sing....&quot;

------------ 

&quot;Ok girls,&quot; Usagi whispered, &quot;this is something special to me
&#39;cause of Mamoru.  I&#39;ll start out, and then we&#39;ll each do a 
verse, Ok?&#39;

And the music began to play a song that neither Ami nor Makoto 
were familiar with.  They were both able to follow the lyrics, 
though.  After the first verse, Usagi squeezed Makoto&#39;s hand and 
Makoto sang:

&quot;I tell myself that I can&#39;t hold out forever.  
I said there is no reason for my fear.  
Cause I feel so secure when we&#39;re together.  
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear.  
And even as I wander, I&#39;m keeping you in sight.  
You&#39;re a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter&#39;s night.  
And I&#39;m getting closer than I ever thought I might.&quot;

As she finished her verse and Usagi took up the next verse, 
Makoto looked over at Ami, heart in her throat.  Ami simply 
stared back at her, confusion and terror on her face.  &quot;I&#39;m not 
singing to her, I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m just helping Usagi.  She&#39;s just 
nervous about singing.  Please don&#39;t let her guess.  I can&#39;t lose 
her, I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Your turn, Ami,&quot; Usagi whispered quickly, &quot;and then we all do 
the big finale together!&quot;

Ami quickly thanked the kami for the distraction, and she sang in 
a soft, hesitant voice:

&quot;My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you.  
I&#39;ve been running around in circles in my mind.  
And it always seems that I&#39;m following you, girl, 
cause you take me to the places that alone I&#39;d never find.&quot;

She stopped, a bit early.  As Usagi jumped into the vacuum, Ami 
dared a look over at Makoto.  Her own thoughts and emotions were 
swirling too quickly for her to grasp.  Like a ship adrift in a 
storm, she looked for a safe harbor, but Makoto&#39;s eyes were just 
as stormy as her own.  &quot;She knows, she knows how I feel and she&#39;s 
angry.  But I can&#39;t help it, I can&#39;t stop it.  Oh Mako-chan 
please don&#39;t be angry with me.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s nails biting into her palm brought her back to the 
moment.  As if from a great distance, Ami could hear Makoto 
singing.

&quot;And I can&#39;t fight this feeling anymore.  
I&#39;ve forgotten what I started fighting for.  
It&#39;s time to bring this ship into the shore, 
and throw away the oars forever.  
Cause I can&#39;t fight this feeling anymore, 
I&#39;ve forgotten what I started fighting for.  
And if I have to crawl across the floor, 
come crashing through the...&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot;  Ami shouted, &quot;I can&#39;t do this!&quot;  Tears streamed down her 
face as she ran from the stage.  Pushing through the crowd, she 
grabbed her jacket and, ignoring Minako and Rei&#39;s concern, dashed 
outside.

&quot;Ami!  Wait!&quot;  Makoto shouted.  Turning to Usagi, she growled, 
&quot;Are you happy now?  If anything happens to her....&quot; Without 
further comment, and without stopping for her coat, Makoto ran 
after Ami.
--------------------

&quot;...and they lived happily ever after!&quot;

&quot;Mommy!  That&#39;s not a happy ending.  You were supposed to tell me 
about when they fell in love, not when you made a mess of 
everything and got them all mad and upset!&quot;

&quot;I did tell you, sweet one.  The next time we saw them, they were 
together and blissfully happy.  Obviously, I saved the day!  I am 
a champion of love and justice, after all.&quot;

&quot;But what happened, Momma!&quot;

&quot;Hmmm, well, I&#39;m not sure exactly what happened.  They just told 
us that they&#39;d worked it all out.  Now, you go to sleep, little 
girl!  You have a big day tomorrow.  Mommy and Daddy have to go 
on a tour so you&#39;ll be spending the evening with your Aunties 
Haruka and Michiru.&quot;

&quot;Ok, Mommy.  G&#39;night...&quot;</pre>
