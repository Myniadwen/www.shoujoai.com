<h1>Darkness (part 3 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>We were brought into a room and were put on a bed. Artemis, Michelle 
and Amara left to bring us some things. I looked at my brother&#39;s who 
were a sleep again, and I followed suit. I laid down and closed my 
eyes and let sleep consume me.

Serena was awakened when she heard the door being opened. Serena 
looked around to see Artemis, Amara, Michelle and some other chick. 
Artemis had his arm wrapped tightly around the women&#39;s waist who had 
long darkish purple hair held up in a bun. She had blue eyes and was 
wearing a short black skirt and a black tube top.

I looked to my brother&#39;s who had shifted awake. The adults looked 
towards us and before coming over. The lady told us that her name was 
Luna and that she had some things for us. The first thing I saw was 
the blood in a see through water bottle. I leaped a Luna who had it in 
her hand and I snatched the bottle from her hand.

I guzzled down half the bottle before I paused to breathe. Everyone 
was staring at me as I sat upon Luna&#39;s chest. The women pushed me off 
and gave a bottle to Jet and Tray. I got up off of the floor and made 
my way to the bed where my brothers sat.

I slowly took another sip and actually tasted the blood. I took the 
bottle away from my lips and made a slight face.

&quot;This isn&#39;t pig&#39;s blood&quot;, I said as I took another gulp.

&quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s human blood.&quot;, said Artemis. Well I didn&#39;t care. 
Just as long I got some blood I was happy. After we were done, my 
brothers went into a separate rooms with Artemis as I was left with 
all of the women. They escorted me to the bathroom and made me strip 
down to nothing. They put me into the tub with bubbles and scrubbed me 
down. My skin started turning red from the constant scrubbing and soon 
the women started doing my hair.

Amara scooped up my dress and dress shoes and happily tossed them into 
the garbage. Luna and Michelle wrapped me up in a big towel and 
brought me back into the bedroom. The brought out some clothes and set 
them down to the side of me.

As soon as they were done dressing me I had my hair up in a ponytail 
with bangs brushing over my eyes. I had on a black t-shirt with black 
jeans and black sneakers. Soon my brothers came in looking refreshed. 
Jet had his black hair spiked up and had on a black Jersey shirt. He 
also had on dark blue jeans and black Lugz boots. Tray had his goldish 
colored hair spiked up also and wore a black muscle shirt with black 
jeans. He also had on dark gray Timberlin boots.

A little girl who looked my age bounced into the room and clung onto 
Artemis&#39;s arm. She had grayish colored long hair laying out freely and 
wore a brown shirt and black jeans. Artemis picked her up as the girl 
gave him a hug. I assumed that, that was his and Luna&#39;s daughter 
because she had their facial looks.

&quot;Diana, this is Serena, Jet and Tray. They are going to be with us for 
know on&quot;, said Artemis as he pointed us out individually. She smiled 
and said hi and we returned the favor. Diana ran out of the room and 
went somewhere down the hall.

&quot;Alright&quot;, said Artemis. &quot;Serena your going to stay with Michelle and 
Amara and the boys are going with me and Luna. You will be going 
through some intense training to learn how to be strong and how to 
protect yourselves.&quot;

&quot;You three won&#39;t be seeing each other for awhile so say your goodbyes 
now.&quot;, said Luna. My brothers came up to me and gave me a big hug and 
a kiss on the cheek before they had to leave. I felt like crying 
because the only family I had left was leaving me for God only knows 
how long.

Amara came up behind me and picked me up. I buried my face into the 
crook of her neck and let the tears flow down my face unconsciously. 
She rubbed my back as Michelle lifted my face and wiped away the 
tears.

&quot;You&#39;ll see them again, so be strong okay.&quot;, said Michelle. I nodded 
my head as we all walked out of the room. We came to a large door and 
Michelle knocked lightly on it. There was a soft reply of come in 
before we entered.

When we entered the room we saw two raven haired girls with them both 
of them having amethyst colored eyes. One looked around 6 or 7 and the 
other looked to be 4. The younger one ran up to Michelle shouting 
Michelle-mamma as the other stayed on the bed staring at me.

Michelle smiled at the girl and picked her up. The little girl giggled 
before she gave Michelle a sloppy kiss on the cheek. The little girl 
greeted her Amara-papa as I stared at the girl on the bed. I could see 
all the horror and pain in her eyes that she tries to shield from the 
world.

We continued our little staring contest until Amara cleared her 
throat. We both looked up at Amara before the woman began speaking.

&quot;So, Rei your not going to come over here and greet us like your 
sister.&quot;, said Amara with a fiend hurt expression. The girl named Rei 
smiled slightly before she came over and hugged Amara tightly and then 
Michelle.

&quot;Okay girls. This is Serena and she&#39;s going to be staying with us 
okay. Oh, and Rei you better be nice or else.&quot;, said Michelle as she 
began staring at Rei. Rei gave a sly smirk before she nodded her head 
yes.

&quot;Serena this is Rei and Hotaru. You&#39;ll be sharing this room with them 
okay.&quot;, said Amara. I nodded my head yes before Amara set me back down 
on the ground.

&quot;If you need us, our room is across the hall.&quot;, said Michelle. I said 
&quot;okay&quot; before the two women began to leave.

&quot;Oh yeah, you three better go to sleep because we waking up early to 
begin our training.&quot;, said Amara before she walked out of the room and 
went to her&#39;s and Michelle&#39;s room. Serena turned away from the door 
and walked towards the empty bed that wasn&#39;t in use.

I walked over to it and pulled the blankets and sheets back. I sat 
down on the bed and began taking off my new shoes and set them beside 
my bed. I felt as if I was being stared at, so I looked up to see Rei 
and Hotaru staring at me.

I smiled at both of them and I got a smile from Hotaru and a glare 
from Rei. I gulped slightly at the look before I turned to Hotaru. 
Hotaru slightly hit Rei on the arm before the girl walked over to me 
and sat on the bed.

&quot;So how come your here?&quot;, asked the little girl. I looked at her and 
than sighed.

&quot;My parents were killed a couple of days ago. Artemis found me and my 
brothers inn an alleyway and brought us here.&quot;, said Hotaru. Hotaru 
held a sad look in her eyes as she stared up at Serena.

&quot;Our parents died and so did our grandpa....&quot;, started Hotaru.

&quot;Hotaru shut up. You don&#39;t go around and tell people our business&quot;, 
growled Rei at her little sister. Hotaru snapped her mouth shut and 
walked over to her bed. The little girl climbed into her bed and 
turned so she didn&#39;t have to look at her big sister. Hotaru&#39;s 
shoulders began to tremble as she tried not to cry.

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to yell at her.&quot;, I said to Rei as I looked at the 
distraught girl in her bed.

&quot;Shut up!&quot;, yelled Rei.

&quot;No I won&#39;t shut up. You got an attitude problem&quot;, I growled though 
clenched teeth. Rei growled back before we heard a bang on the door.

You guy&#39;s better shut your mouths and go to sleep!!&quot;, yelled Amara 
angrily.

Rei and I glared at each other one more time before we climbed in the 
our beds. I turned to my side and we all fell asleep.</pre>
