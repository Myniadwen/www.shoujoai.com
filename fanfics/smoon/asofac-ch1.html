<h1>A Story of Friendship and Curiousity</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lectricity.html">The Ghost of 'lectricity</a><br> </h2>
<pre> The story takes place in the perfect alternate universe where 
Hotaru lives with ... wait a minute! In the perfect universe Hotaru 
would live with me! And all the other senshi too. Wait, let&#39;s start 
this over again.
 The story takes place in an almost perfect universe where Hotaru 
lives with the other outer senshi in their mansion and ChibiUsa 
lives with Usagi and her family. Hotaru is about 14 and ChibiUsa 
about 12.
 Before we begin I would like to thank Naoko Takeuchi for creating 
the beautiful legend of Sailor Moon.
 These characters ain&#39;t mine, I&#39;m just borrowing them for a while

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The phone rang when Haruka was resting from her running training. 
She took up running again because Tokyo was safe for now and she 
began to miss the fighting with Sailor Neptune - it was a great 
training but now she had to keep herself in shape somehow.
 &quot;Hello?&quot; Haruka answered when she picked up the phone.
 &quot;Hello? Haruka-san? This is Usagi.&quot; Then Usagi suddenly giggled 
into the phone. &quot;Stop tickling me you little pink brat. I&#39;m on the 
phone, can&#39;t you see? Hello? Haruka-san? You still there?&quot; Before 
the short-haired girl could answer Usagi already started again 
&quot;Listen Haruka-san, my parents and Shingo are in a spa this week 
and I thought maybe I could spend some time with my Mamo-chan - Aw! 
Stop it!- so I thought maybe ChibiUsa-chan could stay at your place 
with Hotaru-chan for a day or two. Would this be OK with you guys?&quot;
 &quot;Yeah, sure...&quot; but before Haruka could end her sentence Usagi 
already cut in.
 &quot;Could you come and pick her up, please? You know how she loves 
driving with you in your car. In about half an hour?&quot;
 &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll...&quot;
 &quot;Great! See you then in half an hour! Bye!&quot; There was a click in 
the phone line and a tone followed, indicating Usagi already put 
the phone down.
 &quot;...bye...&quot; Haruka said looking at the telephone earpiece with a 
bewildered face.
 &quot;It was Usagi-chan, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Michiru chuckled across the room.
 Haruka looked at her with the still bewildered face and Michiru 
broke out in laughter, not even managing to hold herself on her 
feet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 &quot;That takes care of you, you little pink brat.&quot;
 &quot;Mamo-chan is mine!&quot;
 &quot;Oh yeah? Guess who&#39;ll be spending the next two days alone with 
him.&quot;
 &lt;Damn, she&#39;s right!&gt; ChibiUsa thought.
 &quot;Now, where&#39;s Luna?&quot; Usagi said.
 &quot;Can I be of assistance, your Royal Highness?&quot; Diana said bowing 
down at the door of Usagi&#39;s room.
 &quot;I&#39;m not a Royal Highness, Diana. Stop calling me that.&quot;
 &quot;Oh, but you will be, your Royal Highness.&quot; Usagi realized it&#39;s 
pointless arguing with Diana. After all, she probably inherited 
Luna&#39;s intelligence so Usagi couldn&#39;t win the fight.
 &quot;Where&#39;s your mother, Diana?&quot;
 &quot;She&#39;s in the kitchen, your Royal Highness.&quot;


 &quot;Usagi-chan, I want something to eat!&quot; Luna said when she saw the 
girl enter the kitchen.
 Usagi started opening a can of cat food when she began explaining:
&quot;Luna, I&#39;m going to spend the next days with Mamo-chan and Haruka-
san is coming to pick up ChibiUsa-chan later, she&#39;ll be staying 
with Hotaru-chan until I get back home. You&#39;ll be staying with Ami-
chan if that&#39;s OK with you.&quot;
 Lightly blushing Luna began: &quot;Uhm... Usagi-chan... I&#39;d rather... 
stay at Minako-chan&#39;s house...&quot;
 &quot;With Minako-chan? Why with Minako-chan? I always thought...&quot;
 ChibiUsa, while eating one of Makoto&#39;s cookies, interrupted Usagi 
saying: &quot;Because of Artemis, dumbo!&quot;
 Usagi of course still didn&#39;t understand: &quot;Artemis? Why Artemis? 
Oooooooooooooh! You mean... like I and Mamo-chan...&quot; All three of 
them blushed. &quot;Sure you can stay with Artemis. I mean Minako-chan.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 &quot;You wanna go directly to Hotaru or do you wanna drive around a 
little with me?&quot;
 ChibiUsa was really enjoying the ride as the wind fluttered 
through her ponytails when Haruka was driving her along the cliffs.
 &quot;Drive me around!&quot; ChibiUsa squealed cheerfully.
 &quot;I knew you&#39;d say that.&quot; Haruka replied.
 They sat quietly a while both enjoying the ride - Haruka the 
driving and ChibiUsa being driven.
 &quot;So tell me ChibiUsa, what is your mother doing?&quot;
 &quot;My mother?&quot; the little girl was puzzled for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know. She&#39;s probably... Oh! You mean Usagi?&quot; Then ChibiUsa said to 
herself almost inaudible &quot;Usagi is my mother&quot; like if she had to 
convince herself that this is true. &quot;Because it&#39;s summer break and 
she doesn&#39;t have to go to school, she sleeps &#39;til noon and then she 
hangs out with the other girls or with Mamoru.&quot;
 &quot;Does she let you come with her?&quot; Haruka inquired.
 &quot;Usually she does when she hangs out with the girls but sometimes 
when she&#39;s with her Mamo-chan she doesn&#39;t let me come along. I 
spied once on them and they went in the park and they were kissing 
a lot and touching themselves. Pretty boring if you ask me.&quot; Haruka 
couldn&#39;t help laughing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Michiru opened the door when she heard the sound of the horn of 
Haruka&#39;s car.
 &quot;Hello ChibiUsa.&quot; Michiru greeted the pink haired girl running 
toward the house. &quot;Hotaru is in the backyard.&quot; She continued as the 
little girl was running past her.
 &quot;Hello Michiru, thank you!&quot; ChibiUsa answered her as Michiru was 
already behind her and running toward the back door that leads in 
the backyard.
 Hotaru was sitting on a small bridge that was built across a 
stream. She was watching the fish in the stream and a butterfly was 
fluttering around her black head. When she saw ChibiUsa running up 
to her she got up and smiled brightly. ChibiUsa didn&#39;t slow down 
her pace when she hit and hugged Hotaru so both girls fell in the 
grass beside the stream laughing loudly.
 &quot;ChibiUsa, what are you doing here?&quot;
 &quot;I&#39;ll be staying here for the next few days!&quot;
 &quot;That&#39;s wonderful! How come?&quot;
 &quot;Usagi&#39;s parents and her brother are in a spa for the whole week 
and Usagi wants to be alone with Mamoru so she dumped me here.&quot;
 Hotaru was very happy her best friend could stay with her for a 
while.
 &quot;So, what do you want to do?&quot;
 &quot;I don&#39;t know. Let&#39;s go in the forest! There&#39;s no forest miles 
around Usagi&#39;s house.&quot;
 &quot;Don&#39;t get lost!&quot; Setsuna shouted from the house.
 &quot;We wont!&quot; Both girls shouted back simultaneously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hotaru and ChibiUsa were having fun all day and evening came 
almost too fast. They were in Hotaru&#39;s room ready for bed, both in 
their pajamas. After the pillow fight ChibiUsa decided Hotaru 
needed a tickle as she looked at her with a sly smile on her face.
 &quot;ChibiUsa? ChibiUsa! Don&#39;t look at me like that... no, please... 
don&#39;t do it... please stop...&quot;
 Hotaru was helpless as ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers already began working on 
Hotaru&#39;s ticklish body.
 After a few minutes of mindless tickling both were exhausted and 
lying on their backs breathing heavily. Hotaru thought she would 
die of laughter in this ruthless attack but she was bound for 
another surprise. From the corner of her eye she could see that 
ChibiUsa was looking at her again. She turned her head to face the 
pink demon that had almost killed her but she was shocked to see 
that ChibiUsa was looking at her breasts.
 &quot;ChibiUsa!&quot;
 &quot;Yes?&quot; ChibiUsa asked innocently averting her eyes from Hotaru&#39;s 
breasts and looking her straight in the eyes.
 &quot;What are you doing?!&quot;
ChibiUsa blushed but gathering all of her courage together she 
asked her best friend:
 &quot;Hotaru?&quot;
 &quot;Yes, ChibiUsa?&quot; Now was Hotaru&#39;s turn to play the innocent little 
girl.
 &quot;Uhm... Can I... touch them?&quot;
 Hotaru was shocked. &quot;What?!&quot;
 &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have asked you that.&quot; ChibiUsa almost 
started crying. &quot;It&#39;s just that all of you other senshi except me 
have breasts and I... I... I just wanted know how it feels... I&#39;m 
sorry, just forget what I said...&quot;
 Then Hotaru suddenly interrupted her: &quot;OK, you can touch me...&quot; 
and blushed.
 &quot;Really?&quot; ChibiUsa&#39;s big eyes got even bigger in anticipation.
 &quot;Yes. But only because you&#39;re my best friend.&quot; Hotaru smiled and 
hugged her curious young friend.
 Hotaru sat up on her bed and told ChibiUsa to do the same. &quot;You 
have to be gentle. Do you want me to take my top off?&quot;
 ChibiUsa blushed a little more and looked down whispering a quiet 
yes. Hotaru pulled her top over her head and smiled when she saw 
that ChibiUsa was still looking down.
 &quot;Now that won&#39;t do. First you say you want to touch them and now 
you don&#39;t even want to look at them.&quot; Finally the little girl 
lifted her head and asked shyly: &quot;What do I have to do?&quot;
 &quot;That&#39;s more like it. Let me show you.&quot;
 Hotaru took ChibiUsa&#39;s hands and began stroking her breasts. 
Slowly she took her hands away and ChibiUsa tried to repeat what 
Hotaru had shown her. She was gently stroking her best friend&#39;s 
breasts slowly running her hands around the edges of them. Hotaru 
closed her eyes and trusted her body into ChibiUsa&#39;s hands. 
ChibiUsa was moving slowly away from the edges to the center which 
caused Hotaru to begin breathing more heavily. ChibiUsa cupped her 
left breast to see how it fits into her palm and saw it&#39;s just a 
bit bigger than her hand. She squeezed it a bit and Hotaru moaned 
lightly but ChibiUsa was too busy to notice. She saw how Hotaru&#39;s 
nipples swelled and she took one between her thumb and index 
finger. Hotaru moaned louder and this time ChibiUsa noticed. She 
was felicitous at the fact that obviously she was bringing Hotaru 
great pleasures. She squeezed the nipple and was surprised by the 
reaction - Hotaru moaned even louder and her nipples swelled even 
more.
 Hotaru enjoyed the game as much as ChibiUsa as she felt her juices 
form inside her pussy. ChibiUsa then started twitching Hotaru&#39;s 
left nipple. She even pinched it a little and when she noticed that 
her friend likes it she continued doing it. Then ChibiUsa had an 
idea - she slowly brought her face closer to Hotaru&#39;s breasts and 
kissed her right nipple softly. While she was kissing her right 
button she was pinching and twitching her left button. Her kisses 
became more and more frequent until she finally rested her lips 
around Hotaru&#39;s nipple and began sucking on it. Hotaru&#39;s breathing 
was now shallow and coming out of her mouth in short gasps. As 
ChibiUsa&#39;s tongue was dancing around the hard nipple Hotaru let out 
a final moan and her breathing stopped for a moment. Then her body 
relaxed and she let out a sigh.
 ChibiUsa was confused. Did she do anything wrong? Before she could 
say anything Hotaru ran off to the bathroom. ChibiUsa didn&#39;t know 
what to do, she didn&#39;t know what was going on.


 Hotaru returned quickly and she found a confused little girl 
sitting on the bed.
 &quot;What was that?&quot; ChibiUsa asked concerned.
 &quot;I... I... I had an orgasm.&quot; Hotaru muttered under her breath 
almost inaudible.
 &quot;A what?&quot;
 Then Hotaru stated bravely at a normal volume so ChibiUsa could 
hear her: &quot;I had an orgasm.&quot;
 &quot;What is an orgasm?&quot;
 Ah!, now could Hotaru show off what her &quot;parents&quot; taught her. She 
cleared her throat and began imitating Haruka: &quot;When a girl gets 
sexually aroused certain juices form inside her pus... - Aw! Don&#39;t 
hit me Michiru!&quot; At this point Hotaru looks over to where Michiru 
would sit and trying VERY hard not to giggle while ChibiUsa was 
giggling all the time. &quot;Certain juices form inside her VAGINA and 
if she gets even more aroused the muscles inside her VAGINA 
contract and the juices flow out of her VAGINA. This is called an 
orgasm and it&#39;s very pleasurable.&quot; Hotaru barely made it to the end 
not bursting out laughing and both girls broke out in laughter.
 When both recovered from the laughter ChibiUsa finally asked 
Hotaru:
 &quot;So you liked it?&quot;
 &quot;Yes, thank you ChibiUsa.&quot;
 &quot;And Haruka told you that about orgasm and stuff?&quot;
 &quot;All three told me: Setsuna-mama, Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama. We 
had a day called the day of the truth - Setsuna-mama came up with 
that name. We had to walk around the house naked all day and I 
could ask them anything about sex and stuff. It was fun!&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Meanwhile in the living room Haruka and Michiru were talking.
 &quot;Haruka, I&#39;m worried about Hotaru.&quot;
 &quot;And why is that, Michiru my love?&quot;
 &quot;She hangs out with ChibiUsa a lot. Do you think she is... uhm... 
like us?&quot;
 &quot;And would that be such a bad thing?&quot;
 &quot;NO! I... I... I meant...&quot;
 Haruka started chuckling: &quot;Don&#39;t worry my love. I know what you 
meant. I&#39;ll tell you a story to make you feel better. A few weeks 
ago when I picked her up from school I saw that she was looking at 
a boy. But when she saw me she quickly looked away and blushed a 
little. She was so cute.&quot;
 Michiru was silent for a minute and then whispered in her lover&#39;s 
ear: &quot;Why don&#39;t we go upstairs into our bedroom my love...&quot;
