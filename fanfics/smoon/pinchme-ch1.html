<pre>&quot;You want what?&quot;

&quot;To stay here for a week or two.&quot;

&quot;Serena, why would-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s important, very-&quot;

&quot;Well you can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Rei...please.&quot;

&#39;Her, here for a week, I couldn&#39;t-&#39;

&quot;Fine, than I&#39;ll be in the woods, all alone, defenseless.&quot;

&quot;...Whaddya mean defenseless?&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot;

Serena got up and started to leave.

&quot;Wait...&quot;

Serena stopped.

&quot;Look, before I let you stay here for a week, I want to know why.&quot;

Serena turned and sat back down.

&quot;I need to know&quot;: Serena

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I just...&quot;

&quot;Hhh, hhh,-&quot;: Rei

&quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;You drive me so...urggh.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Serena&#39;s eyes were downcast.

&quot;Look I don&#39;t (&#39;She looks so adorable.&#39;) mean to, just tell me why.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll say no.&quot;

&quot;Tell me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll be asleep for a week.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve gotta be kidding me. Get out.&quot;

&quot;Rei.&quot;

&quot;You want to-&quot;

Tears were now flowing down Serena&#39;s face.

&quot;Hhh, fine, I won&#39;t be asleep.&quot;

&quot;...Nani?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be in a...trance.&quot;

Rei&#39;s jaw dropped.

&quot;You&#39;re joking, right?&quot;

The tears had stopped. Serena looked at Rei. Rei started to back away, 
than stopped. She had never seen Serena&#39;s eyes like this before. It was 
like she was another person. (Author now. Think of the way Princess 
Serenity looked at Beryl before she killed/banished her. Or how Sailor 
Moon always looks at the bad guys leader when the chips are down.)

&quot;... Serena&quot;:Rei

&quot;I could order you to do this. You are my warrior. Or I could force 
you. I choose to do neither.&quot;

Rei just stared. 

&#39;I don&#39;t see the crescent moon. Is this-&#39;

&quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;Uhhm. What do you mean-&quot;

&quot;This has been a waste of my time.&quot;

Serena once more got up

&quot;Wait!&quot;: Rei got up.

&quot;Well?&quot;

Serena had stopped walking, but her head hadn&#39;t turned.

&quot;I-&quot;

&quot;Make up your mind, now.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot;

Serena shook her head a little, and then bowed it.  Rei came in front 
of her. Serena was rubbing the bridge between her nose and forehead 
with eyes closed.

&quot;Daijobu?&quot;

&quot;Huh? You agreed, right?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

Serena made all the arrangements. Telling everyone, she&#39;d be gone for a 
week. Not really saying where. Just assuring them she&#39;d be alright...
Rei arranged with Granpa and Chad.

&quot;You remember what I said?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, no one to disturb you. Serena, I don&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;I need to do this.&quot;

&quot;Can you tell me...&quot;

&quot;Just trust me, okay?&quot;

&quot;...Like I have a choice.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Just go do whatever it is you need to do.&quot;

Serena went into the room and closed the door.

The days passed, on the second day of the week, people started 
wondering a little. But, didn&#39;t worry too much. The meeting at the 
temple seemed a little strained. Amy was in a bad mood and Rei couldn&#39;t 
help getting into a fight with Mina, telling her she was worse than 
Serena Everyone laughed, but the tension didn&#39;t go away.

&#39;I didn&#39;t think we needed her so much.&#39;: Rei thought.

Finally the meeting ended. There was a sigh throughout the room. 
Everyone except Amy left.

&quot;Rei.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You know where she is.&quot;

&quot;How should I know where-&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t lie to me.&quot;

&quot;...She asked us not to look for her.&quot;

&quot;Rei.&quot;

Rei could see the anger in her eyes.

&quot;Spit it out already.&quot;

At first the angry look stayed. Amy&#39;s mouth moved but nothing came out. 
Her mouth closed. Then Rei could see sadness in her eyes.

&quot;Why...why did she choose you?!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Amy was now crying.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t she choose me. I mean, whatever she&#39;s doing, sniff. Can&#39;t 
she trust me?&quot;

&quot;Amy.&quot;

Rei went to hug her.

Amy backed away: &quot;Don&#39;t&quot;

There was silence between the two, then

&quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

Amy turned and walked away.

&quot;Amy!&quot;

She turned: &quot;Rei, I&#39;m not stupid. I...I just know.&quot;

&quot;But.&quot;

&quot;Just...bye.&quot;

Amy left.

The week passed uneventfully after that, until...

&quot;Mars flame sniper.&quot;

&quot;Venus love chain.&quot;

A youma had appeared, only it was as usual. This youma changed into 
whatever form it was attacked with. It would become fire when attacked 
by Mars and so forth.

&quot;Uranus, where&#39;s Pluto?&quot;: Rei shouted.

&quot;She...she&#39;s not coming.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;: Mercury.

They continued their barrage without effect.

It attacked Uranus who barely fended it off with her sword. Then 
Neptune, who raised her mirror, but it had gone to Venus.

&quot;Aaagh.&quot;: my arm. Mercury jumpkicked at it, but it was gone.

&#39;Damn, towards me.&#39;: Rei punched, but it flowed like water. In the same 
instant, claws came towards her throat. &#39;Damn, what&#39;ll-&#39;: Just before 
the claws reached.  A ray shot through it&#39;s head. It fell.

&quot;What the.&quot;

The youma hit the ground. It started to melt and flow into itself.

&quot;It&#39;s still alive, everybody hit it.&quot;

The attacks came. It rose like a long string, then it glowed.

&quot;Get away Rei.&quot;: Mina

She jumped and the youma exploded. The blast threw her a few feet.

&quot;Oww.&quot;

The scouts were all on the ground.

Uranus came over to Rei.

&quot;Daijobu?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;: She got up. &quot;Ahh, my knee.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll help her.&quot;: Mercury.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay Uranus.&quot;

Uranus gave her to Mercury.

The scouts got up and seperated into groups. Mina went with Lita and so 
forth.

Rei overheard a little conversation. When out of sight, they 
detransformed. 

&quot;Amy.&quot;

&quot;...I can&#39;t help but wonder.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, who blasted that youma.&quot;

&quot;You know that wasn&#39;t what I was talking about.&quot;

&quot;...What?&quot;

&quot;Why Serena trusts you so much.&quot;

&quot;...Amy.&quot;

&quot;...I guess she knows she can depend on you.&quot;

&quot;She depends on-&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t lie, please.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

They walked in silence.

&quot;So, who do you-&quot;

&quot;Rei, it was Serena.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s-&quot;

&quot;Amy looked at her.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;Help me go faster.&quot;

They arrived back at the temple. Amy helped Rei inside to a chair. 

&quot;See you Amy.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t lie to me anymore, it&#39;s demeaning.&quot;

&quot;When did I lie.&quot;

Amy went up to her and whispered in her ear.

&quot;Rei, do you think I really bought that story about Serena leaving the 
Crescent Moon wand under you bed.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes widened: &quot;That was a long time ago Amy.&quot;

Amy moved in front of her: &quot;The point is...I&#39;m not stupid. I&#39;ve come 
to accept it. All I ask is one thing.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t leave me out anymore Rei. It hurts.&quot;

&quot;...Please?&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot;

&quot;Arigoto.&quot;: Amy kissed Rei on the cheek. Amy looked as stunned as Rei. 
Then Amy left.

Rei put her hand to her cheek: &quot;Uhnnn...Whoa.&quot;

&quot;Granpa! You here.?&quot;. No answer. &quot;Chad?!&quot;. Nothing.

Out of dimensional pocket she pulled her first aid supplies. (Author: 
Yeah it&#39;s cheap. But why wouldn&#39;t they keep a first aid kit in their 
dimensional pockets.). Rei finished bandaging her knee. She knew where 
she had to go.

She looked at Serena. Serena lay there, barely breathing. She leaned 
against the wall.

&#39;But, if she&#39;s there than who helped us. That wasn&#39;t one of her 
attacks.&#39; Rei looked once more at her Then got into bed in the same 
room. In a different bed.

Morning

Rei got up. She looked at Serena.

&#39;Still...wait...it&#39;s been eight days.&#39;: Rei and Serena had agreed, no 
more than a week.

The day passed, Serena&#39;s parents called. They hadn&#39;t heard from her and 
were worried. They had called all her other friends. The day passed 
with Rei getting more and more upset. Finally, it was over. She had 
nearly exploded at Molly. When she had been asked for the seventeenth 
time.

&#39;Oh man, next time, if Amy wants the job, she can have it.&#39;

&quot;Rei.&quot;

&quot;I DON&#39;T KNOW-&quot;

&quot;REI!&quot;

&quot;Oh Granpa.&quot;

&quot;She must be a good friend for you to lie for her.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t...but sometimes these things take longer.&quot;

&quot;You...you know.&quot;

&quot;I know that Serena is on a long journey. Farther than I would like to 
go.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll come back when she can.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

Rei was walking away.

&quot;Rei.&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes...never mind.&quot;

Granpa was leaving.

&quot;What? Tell me.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes these journeys leave the traveller changed. And...it can 
be hard on them.&quot;

&quot;What are you saying?&quot;

&quot;What I&#39;ve said. Oyasumi nasai.&quot;

&quot;Oyasumi.&quot;

Rei went to the room. Unlocking the door and inside. Locking it back 
up.

&quot;Serena.&quot;

No response.

Rei got into bed and went to sleep

Thud

&quot;Huh, who&#39;s there?&quot;

Rei was out of bed in a flash with the lights on.

&quot;Se...Serena.&quot;

Hard eyes looked at her.

Rei froze, then she put out her hand: &quot;Let me-&quot;

Her hand was smacked away.

&quot;No. I can do it myself.&quot;

&quot;Serena, you&#39;ve been in bed-&quot;

Serena crawled along the floor.

&quot;Fine.&quot;

&quot;Serena.&quot;

She crawled to the door.

She tried to get up.

&quot;Look, let me-&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;: The voice was flat. And cracked.

Rei helped Serena up and got the door open. She took her to the 
bathroom.

&quot;You stink.&quot;

&quot;...Serena?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot;: Flat voiced.

Rei helped Serena to the bathroom.

&quot;Uhhm.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m thirsty.&quot;

&quot;Yeah uhhm.&quot;

&quot;Undress me, put me in the tub and get me something to drink.&quot;

&quot;Uhhn, right.&quot;

Rei undress Serena, trying not to blush.

&#39;She&#39;s lost weight.&#39;

Serena&#39;s stomach was flat, she had lost a little muscle too.

Serena&#39;s was leaning on Rei all the while being undressed.

&#39;She&#39;s-&#39;

&quot;Can we get on with this?&quot;

&quot;What...&quot;: Rei looked at her and blushed: &quot;Uun, yeah sure.&quot;

Serena was in the tub. Rei went and got her some water.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

(Okay, in this Rei has something like a hot tub. So a glass can be put 
on the side. Remember when I said this would be short, guess I was 
right. Though compared to some, this will be short. I hope.)

&quot;Damn.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Get me out.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Are you deficient?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

Serena tried to get up, but her muscles were still sore from being in 
bed all week.

&quot;Get me to a toilet.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Rei helped her to one.

&quot;You mind turning around.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot;

Serena did her buisness Then: &quot;You mind.&quot;

&quot;Serena, what is wrong with you?&quot;

&quot;Hhh, hhh, nothing.&quot;

Rei helped her back into the tub.

&quot;Uhhm, did you-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s cold.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;The water.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot;

Rei went stared the fire to heat the tub, threw in a few logs and came 
back.

Serena&#39;s eyes were closed and tears flowed down her cheeks.

&quot;Serena?&quot;

Her eyes flared open. Rei felt her heart stop. Her eyes conveyed anger, 
and a sadness which Rei hadn&#39;t ever seen.

&quot;Se...Serena.&quot;

Serena blinked, than her eyes were simply hard.

&quot;What...what did you-&quot;

&quot;Can I get some privacy?&quot;

(Okay, I can end this here, or keep going. I vote for both. Rewrite 
later. Alternate ending or maybe not. See what happens.)

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

Serena bathed as if Rei wasn&#39;t there.

&quot;What the hells wrong with you?&quot;

Serena stopped, looked at her: &quot;What should be wrong. I&#39;ve got my 
friends, my family. And there always there for me, right? RIGHT?!!&quot;

&quot;Hey, keep it down.&quot;

&quot;Fine, so nothings wrong.&quot;

&quot;What did-&quot;

Serena started bathing again, ignoring Rei.

&quot;I want to know-&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because I helped you to do this. I want to know what you saw.&quot;

&quot;I saw what I had to.&quot;

&quot;Which was?&quot;

&quot;Go away.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m not leaving.&quot;

&quot;Why not, you left me...&quot;: Serena looked away.

&quot;I would never leave you.&quot;

&quot;I want to bathe in peace, this is the bathing room, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

Rei started getting undressed.

&quot;What are-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to take a bath with you.&quot;

&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll leave.&quot;

&quot;Owww.&quot;

Serena had tried to get out. But she was still sore.

&quot;What, can&#39;t get out?&quot;

The angry look came into Serena&#39;s eyes again. She raised herself up and 
started getting out of the tub.

&#39;Damn, I shouldn&#39;t have said that.&#39;

&quot;Gomen.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going.&quot;

&quot;What, but-&quot;

&quot;Sayonara.&quot;

&#39;No.&#39;

Rei was by Serena&#39;s side.

&quot;Serena, c&#39;mon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m leaving.&quot;

&quot;Please stay.&quot;

Serena walked faster.

&quot;Please don&#39;t leave, not like this.&quot;

Serena kept walking.

&quot;Please, please don&#39;t leave me alone.&quot;: Tears went down Rei&#39;s cheeks.

Serena turned quickly she almost fell, but pushed against the wall.

&quot;What did you say?&quot;

Rei sank to her knees.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t leave me.&quot;

&quot;I...fine.&quot;

Serena pushed herself along the wall. Rei looked up at her. She was up 
like a shot at Serena&#39;s side. They got back to the bathroom. Rei looked 
at Serena, her eyes seemed softer. They got to the bathtub.

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;The water&#39;s dirty.&quot;: Rei.

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;Let me drain it.&quot;

&quot;So, I&#39;ll stand here naked and catch a cold. Real bright.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get you a robe.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

Rei helped Serena to a bench. Drained the tub. Got dressed, got her a 
robe. And stared filling the tub.

&quot;Serena.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want the tub to overflow.&quot;

&quot;...The tub was full.

&quot;Y&#39;know, you should have showered first.&quot;

&quot;...You want me to clean your tub...I&#39;ll call someone.&quot;

&quot;Your-&quot;

Hard eyes looked at her, stopping the words on her tongue.

&quot;...Serena.&quot;

&quot;We need heat&quot;

&quot;Uhhmm&quot;

Rei blushed.

&quot;For the tub, what did you...&quot;: Serena looked down and shook her 
head.

Rei went put some more wood on the fire and came back

Serena insisted on undressing herself. Rei could hear her moaning 
though.

&quot;Let me help.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t-&quot;

&quot;Please.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;: Serena whispered something after.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Just do the job.&quot;

&quot;But-&quot;

Serena shook her head. Rei continued without a word. She helped Serena 
into the tub, then got undressed and got in.

They were at opposite ends of the tub. Serena sat back with her eyes 
closed. Silence reigned for a few minutes. Rei just looked at Serena. 
Serena&#39;s eyes opened.

&#39;Why. Why is she looking at me like that.&#39;

&quot;Serena.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Why...tell me-&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Then, why are you acting like this?&quot;

Serena ignored her.

&quot;Serena...&quot;

&quot;Why are you acting like...you&#39;re acting like...like me.&quot;

&quot;Serena looked at her.&quot;

Rei didn&#39;t say anything. Serena went back to bathing.

&quot;...How?...Why?...You were alone, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

Serena was inch from Rei

&quot;...You don&#39;t know. Just...it&#39;s not your business.&quot;

Serena went back to her side.

&quot;We...I wouldn&#39;t leave you.&quot;

Serena looked away: &quot;Wanna bet?&quot;: For the first time, she didn&#39;t sound 
so angry. It was sadness in her voice.

&quot;But I would never-&quot;

&quot;Forget it.&quot;

(Okay, thought I could finish this tonight, doesn&#39;t look like it 
though. Hope to get this done soon though.&quot;)

&quot;Please tell me.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because, I&#39;m your friend.&quot;

&quot;Are you?&quot;

&quot;Dammit, what do you want?!&quot;

&quot;I want a lot of things, but I&#39;m not going to get them.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot;

Serena shook her head.

Serena took off Darien&#39;s engagement ring.

&quot;What are you doing.?&quot;

&quot;This is one of the things I want.&quot;

&quot;To not marry Darien?&quot;

&quot;...Perhaps.&quot;

&quot;But...but you have to-&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;What...what the hell is wrong with you?!&quot;

&quot;...Shall I go?&quot;

&quot;No, I want-&quot;

&quot;You can have him.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes almost popped out of her head. She just stared at Serena, 
wide eyed.

&quot;You always wanted Darien. Well, you can have him.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

What the hell is wrong with you?!!!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want to wake everybody.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care!!!&quot;

&quot;Why...exactly.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;: Rei rubbed her forehead.: &quot;...You think I don&#39;t care?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;You are...ahhgh.&quot;

&quot;Goodbye.&quot;: Serena got out of the tub.

&quot;Where are you-&quot;

&quot;Home.&quot;

&quot;Serena.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;If...if I&#39;ve ever meant anything to you at all, you won&#39;t leave.&quot;

&quot;Fine...but I&#39;m hungry.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;: Serena left the room.

Rei got out of the tub and got dressed.

She found Serena at the door.

&quot;Are you crazy, you&#39;re naked?!&quot;

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;Get in here.&quot;

Rei grabbed Serena&#39;s arm.

&quot;Let me go.&quot;

&quot;No, not unnng.&quot;: Rei&#39;s arm suddenly couldn&#39;t hold on. Then it stopped.

&quot;What the?&quot;

&quot;Say-&quot;:Serena

&quot;Please.&quot;

&quot;Sigh, hhh.&quot;

&quot;Just tell me what&#39;s wrong.&quot;

&quot;You really want to know&quot;: Her voice was hard and angry.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Serena stared hard at Rei. She nodded her head. Then turned around and 
walked back inside. Rei followed, they arrived at the kitchen.

&quot;Let me get you some clothes.&quot;

&quot;No. You know. I always thought that (Tears started comind down 
Serena&#39;s cheeks.). Hhh, In the end.&quot;

Serena closed her eyes and shook her head.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;What did you want from me Rei?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Never mind.&quot;

&quot;No. I want the old Serena back.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot;

&quot;I...I want...&quot;

&quot;What, really?&quot;

&quot;Why...why are you asking me this?&quot;

&quot;Did I hurt you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, now!&quot;

&quot;No, did I ever hurt you?!&quot;

&quot;I...why?&quot;

&quot;In the end...&quot;

&quot;You keep saying that!&quot;

Serena just stood there eyes moving slightly then she whispered: &quot;You 
leave me.&quot;

&quot;I what?&quot;

&quot;You heard me.&quot;

&quot;I would never-&quot;

&quot;You do.&quot;

Rei was silent.

&quot;So, tell me, why do-&quot;

&quot;A trick.&quot;

&quot;...No.&quot;

&quot;It has to-&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;I would never-&quot;

&quot;You do.&quot;

&quot;Then the others-&quot;

&quot;All. All of you.&quot;

Rei sank to her knees: &quot;No.&quot;

&quot;So, how do I hurt you?&quot;

&quot;You...hhhh, hhh...you never gave me a chance.&quot;

&quot;None of us.&quot;

Serena&#39;s face showed confusion: &quot;I...I don&#39;t-&quot;

&quot;Always Darien. Always.&quot;

&quot;You.&quot;: Serena walked over to Rei. She cupped Rei&#39;s chin with her hand 
and lifted her head, Rei looked away: &quot;You want...me?&quot;

&quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot;: Serena walked around in a daze. Rei got up.

&quot;All of...you...&quot;

&quot;Are you happy now? You wanted to know. Now you...&quot;: Rei was crying.

Serena looked at her. Eyes confused: &quot;You want...(as she said this she 
started to crumple)...me?&quot;

Rei caught her before she hit the floor. 

&quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;You want to lie down?&quot;

&quot;I...I&#39;m hungry.&quot;

Rei helped her onto a chair.

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Ser-&quot;

&quot;The chair&#39;s cold.&quot;

Rei looked at her: &#39;She&#39;s...naked. I...I forgot.&#39;: Rei just stared 
at her.

&quot;I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll get you a robe.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Rei went: &#39;I told her...what...what&#39;s going to happen now?&#39;: She 
came back. Serena was staring off into space.

&quot;Here.&quot;

Serena took the robe and put it on. She just sat there staring.

&quot;Serena.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;You uhhm...uh, when do I leave you?&quot;

&quot;HH, later.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but-&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re going to ask when. I can&#39;t tell you.&quot;

&quot;Why not!&quot;

&quot;It would alter the timeline.&quot;

&quot;Hhh, like you knowing doesn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Sigh, I...I know what has to be done.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so you&#39;re the all...&quot;: The words died in Rei&#39;s mouth with the 
look Serena gave her.

Serena closed her eyes and shook her head: &quot;Its all relative.&quot;

Rei just looked at her.

&quot;I&#39;m hungry.&quot;

&quot;...Fine.&quot;

They had some leftovers, Serena ate three times what Rei ate.

&quot;What are you a bottomless pit?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t eaten in a week. What are you...&quot;

&quot;Serena?&quot;

&quot;I was going to call you blind, but I&#39;m the one who&#39;s been blind.&quot;

&quot;Ser-&quot;

Serena got up: &quot;Come here Rei.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Come here.&quot;

Rei got up, they stood facing each other.

Serena shook her head.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Rei, (Another shake, eyes closed and head tilted downwards. She looked 
at Rei.), all you had to do was ask.&quot;

&quot;Nani.&quot;

Serena kissed her lightly on the lips.

&quot;Ser-&quot;

Another kiss, then she put her arms around Rei.

&quot;What are-&quot;

&quot;This is what you want, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;But.&quot;

Serena&#39;a eyes grew hard: &quot;You&#39;re rejecting me.&quot;

&quot;N...no, but what about Darien.&quot;

&quot;What about him?&quot;

&quot;Serena, you can&#39;t...you can&#39;t do this to him.&quot;

&quot;Hhh, ha, hhh, hahaha. So...he&#39;s still...so...what do you want?&quot;

&quot;Talk to him. I mean, this wouldn&#39;t be right.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want me.&quot;

&quot;No, cheating on him.&quot;

Serena disengaged from Rei.

&quot;Fine, I suppose I should call my parents.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, with...you should.&quot;

Serena went and called her parents.

&#39;What am I thinking, it&#39;s late, she...well, they do miss her.&#39;

&quot;I talked to mom, she was upset, but understanding.&quot;

&quot;Serena, I-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to bed...Rei, could you...&quot;

&quot;Not tonight.&quot;

&quot;But.&quot;

&quot;You need to talk to Darien.&quot;

&quot;Night.&quot;: Serena&#39;s voice was hard and angry: &quot;Why don&#39;t I call him 
now?&quot;: Serena went to the phone.

&quot;What do-&quot;

Serena&#39;s stare stopped her.

&quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Yes I know it&#39;s late.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m going to see other people-&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be engaged at this juncture.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Yes. It&#39;s me.&quot;

&quot;Serena, what are you doing?&quot;: Rei

&quot;Give me a moment Darien. What you wanted. Now, I have to finish this. 
Darien-&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;ll get married later, I think.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Hhhh, don&#39;t bring her into this, this is about us.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Yes, at least, I think I do.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Stop freaking out, we can discuss it more when you come visit.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Do what you want, but the engagement is over, and I&#39;m seeing other 
people.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;How can I? You left-&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Goodbye Darien.&quot;

&quot;Serena you can&#39;t do this, we&#39;re-&quot;: Rei could hear his voice as Serena 
took the receiver from her ear.

Click.

Rei stared at her: &quot;What do you-&quot;

&quot;Sigh, good night.&quot;: Serena walked to the room.

&quot;No, you just broke up-&quot;

Serena stopped: &quot;...He...what do you want?&quot;

&quot;I want you to call him back.&quot;

Serena turned around and walked up to Rei. Noses nearly touching.

&quot;You wanted this. I did it.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but-Mmmph.&quot;

Rei was cut off as Serena quickly embraced her in a kiss.

Okay, this could be it ; Twenty- seven pages. Moon Warrior 1 speaking: 
But, after all that, it doesn&#39;t feel finished It would be a short 
partly sweet ending. But I don&#39;t think so, gonna break. Oh, and I may 
make a sequel, if I get a non flaming Email. Oh, and as for Rei and not 
Raye, can&#39;t bring myself to do it, I mix original and dub names. That&#39;s 
all for now.

Okay, back again. Yeah, this is long enough for this one, as mentioned, 
I get Email or feel like it. Out comes sequel. As for &quot;Am I too late?&quot;, 
I&#39;m going to try and work on it. Actually I did do some, but it got 
deleted. (Bad computer.). So when I get the strength, I&#39;m gonna try to 
do more. Ja matta. And Daijobu is alright, Oyasumi and oyasumi nasai 
means good night. Nani is what. Ja matta is see you later. Think that&#39;s 
all. Moon Warrior 1 out.  That&#39;s all, no more. In other words: The end.</pre>
