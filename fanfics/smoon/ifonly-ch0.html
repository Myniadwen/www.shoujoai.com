<h1>If Only (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meikosama.html">Azfixiation</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Minako?&quot; I softly whisper her name noticing how easily it flows from
my mouth. She truly is the Goddess of Love and Beauty. It&#39;s funny I
suppose, how I&#39;ve known her for so long, and even though she&#39;s been my
best friend for years now I still get nervous around her. When she gets
close to me my hands tremble. When I try to speak to her I often notice
the crack in my voice. I try my best to hide my feelings for her but I&#39;m
not sure how long this will last. One day I&#39;ll have to tell her how I feel.

I&#39;ve come to accept the way I feel about her and no longer condemn
myself for it. I live for moments like this when I have her to myself.
When she is completely mine, even if only for a brief time. She flirts
with me all the time and she always finds a way to be next to me,
touching me in some manner. I&#39;ve realized it&#146;s just her personality. Still,
I carry the false hope that maybe there&#39;s more to it.

&quot;Minako?&quot; I ask her name once more as I look down at her sleeping
face. She&#39;s resting her head on my lap fast asleep as I sit on the end of
my couch. I try to focus on the end of the movie we were watching but
my eyes see nothing but her. My arm is resting on her side as I look
down to see her sleeping face completely relaxed and innocent. Yes,
this is torture, but still I know I wouldn&#39;t give it up for anything in the
world.

Once I realize she&#39;s asleep my body betrays me as my hands go of their
own accord to run my fingers through her soft blond hair. Stopping
briefly to caress the soft skin of her cheek I realize I&#39;m crying though I&#39;m
not sure why. I try to make myself stop but my body continues to do as
it pleases. I bend down so slowly and just barely brush my lips against
her warm cheek&#39;s kissing her for the first time. My heart beats faster up
as I realize what I&#39;ve just done. Heaven and Hell are as one as I go
though this sweet pain. If only I had the courage to tell her how I feel...
