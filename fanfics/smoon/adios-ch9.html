fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The senshi detransformed and started walking back towards the temple.

&quot;Who the hell was that,&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;I dunno,&quot; Ami said. &quot;She was dressed as a senshi. Maybe she&#39;s one of 
us?&quot;

&quot;Maybe its a trap,&quot; Usagi said.

&quot;Maybe it isn&#39;t,&quot; Minako said. &quot;Didn&#39;t Artemis and Luna say there were 
once five of us?&quot;

&quot;Hai, they did,&quot; Aim said. &quot;Maybe...she was our fifth member.&quot;

&quot;Why would she run and hide from us then,&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;Probably for the same reason you did, Minako,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;Why did 
you do that, anyway? You never told us.&quot;

Minako blinked and turned slightly red. &quot;I..uh...Maybe later.&quot; Minako 
started to walk faster and the other girls just groaned.

When they reached the temple, Makoto was waiting for them. She was 
leaning against the wall, with her arms crossed over her chest. It was 
obvious she was cold, but she would never say it.

Minako ran up to her and smiled. &quot;Hey.&quot;

&quot;Hi,&quot; Makoto said. The others smiled at Makoto as they passed her, all 
but Ami who kept her eyes forward. Makoto just rolled her eyes. 

When the others were far enough ahead of them, Makoto leaned down and 
whispered,&quot; Youma in the park I take it.&quot;
Mianko looked up at Makoto shocked. &quot;Minako, I knew. You knew I 
knew...don&#39;t give me that look.&quot;

Minako half smiled and nodded. &quot;Hai. We took care of it.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

I turned around too late to see the fallen star
I fell asleep and never saw the sun go down
I took your love for granted
Thought luck was always on my side
I turned around too late and you were gone

The girls sat in Rei&#39;s room, just talking about the concert and how 
great Makoto and Yuuchirou&#39;s band was the best band there.

When two in the morning rolled around, Makoto streached and decided it 
was time for her to leave. Minako didn&#39;t want her to go, and Rei knew 
this. She had sensed Minako&#39;s feelings toward the amazon, but wasn&#39;t 
sure if Minako was aware of them herself.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Rei said, stopping Makoto before she left the room. &quot;Why 
don&#39;t you stay the night? Its late and you can take that spare bedroom 
again.&quot;

Makoto smiled and declined. &quot;Iie. I should go.&quot;

&quot;Aw, come on, Mako-chan,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;Please?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Makoto looked at Minako who was pleading with her to stay with 
her eyes. Makoto sighed and shook her head. Smiling slightly, she 
answered, &quot;Alright, alright. Enough with the looks already.&quot;

Minako smiled from ear to ear as did Rei. She was for sure, now, how 
Minako felt.

&quot;But I should go to bed,&quot; Makoto said, covering her yawn with her 
hand. &quot;I&#39;m really tired. Oyasumi nassi.&quot; The others said their 
goodnights to Makoto as she left Rei&#39;s room.

When they were sure Makoto was gone, Luna and Artemis popped out from 
underneath the bed.

&quot;We need to talk,&quot; Luna said to the girls.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So...this new girl is a senshi too,&quot; Usagi said, making sure she had 
understood what her guardian was telling her.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Luna nodded. 

&quot;So, was that tiger her guardian,&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Artemis said. &quot;I don&#39;t remeber him from the Silver 
Millenium.&quot;

&quot;Maybe he&#39;s a new guardian for the century and not the last,&quot; Minako 
asked.

&quot;Could be,&quot; Luna said. &quot;But we&#39;re not completly sure yet.&quot;

&quot;Whats the new senshi&#39;s name,&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;We&#39;re not sure on the secret idenety name, but her senshi name is 
Sailor Jupiter,&quot; Luna said. &quot;She was the most powerful of the senhi 
during the era of the Moon Kingdom. Stronger even when compared to 
Sailor Moon.&quot;

&quot;She was stronger than me,&quot; Usagi asked.

Artemis and Luna nodded. 

&quot;That sucks! I&#39;m the princess. I&#39;m suppossed to be all powerful.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t act TOO modest now, Odango,&quot; Rei said, rolling her eyes.

&quot;Whats the matter Rei? Afraid I&#39;m gonna challange your snobbiness?&quot;

Minako, Ami, and the cats groaned as the Priestess and Princess 
fought.

&quot;Minna, would you please chill out,&quot; Ami said, a sweatdrop forming on 
the back of her head.

The bickering continued.

After a few moments and Rei and Usagi calmed down, everyone found a 
place to sleep. Minako and Ami always found it weird that, even tho 
they bickered all the time, Rei and Usagi would always share a bed.

Minako hit her pillow in the dark, trying to get it just right. 
Everyone else had fallen asleep. She could hear Rei and Usagi snoreing 
in the bed, and small little whisps of air coming from Ami.

Minako sighed and sat up, her eyes adjusting to the dark. Looking over 
at the bed, she saw Luna and Artemis asleep on the end, near Rei&#39;s 
feet. Luna had her head on Artemis&#39;s front feet, his head was resting 
on her back. Minako couldn&#39;t help but to smile.

Minako laied back down, the silence almost too loud for her ears. She 
closed ehr eyes and listened to the crickets out side, the chirping 
getting on her nerves.

She opened her eyes when she heard a piano being played. The sound was 
faint, but she knew it had to be Makoto playing this late at night.

Quietly standing and walking out of the room, Minako headed for the 
practice room. Slowly slididng the door open, Minako poked her head in 
and saw no one was there. Confused, she heard another door slide 
closed and walked to it. The light was outin the room, so she quietly 
again opened the door. Inside she saw Makoto laying in the spare 
bedroom. The moon was shinign just at the right angle for Minako to 
see Makoto was only wearing her bra to cover herself up. Minako was 
pretty sure Makoto also had her jeans off as well.

Minako smiled when her eyes reached Makoto&#39;s face. She seemed so 
innocent when she sleeped. Makoto&#39;s hair was braided so it would be 
less tangled in the morning. 

Smiling a little more, Mianko was about to leave when Makoto stopped 
her.

&quot;What do you want, Mina-chan?&quot;

&quot;I heard the piano..I thought you were playing.&quot;

&quot;Iie. Just a station I was listening to while I was getting ready for 
bed.&quot; Makoto looked up at Minako, one eye cracked open. &quot;You alright?&quot;

&quot;H-hai. Just..I couldn&#39;t sleep.&quot;

&quot;Again? Minako, are you an insomniac?&quot;

Minako giggled a little. &quot;Iie, I&#39;m not.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t prove it by me,&quot; Makoto smiled slightly. &quot;Sure you&#39;re 
alright?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Minako said, stepping into the room a little more, then 
stepping back out. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go back to bed.&quot;

&quot;Hey Minako?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot;

Makoto paused for a moment then flipped her covers open slightly. 
Minako smiled at the offer and stepped into the room, closing the door 
behind her.

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako woke the next day with a slight weight around her waist. Her 
pillow was was very warm and soft. As was the bed. She moved her arms 
slightly and thats when she realized somone was holding her.

Opening her eyes, she looked up and smiled. Makoto was also awake. 
Minako blushed and buried her face into Makoto&#39;s chest. She felt 
Makoto rub her back gently and laugh quietly.

&quot;Morning, Mina,&quot; Makoto said quietly.

&quot;Good morning, Minako said, even quieter.

&quot;There you are!&quot;

Both girls looked up to see Rei standing in the door way.

&quot;I&#39;ve been looking for you everywhere Minako,&quot; Rei said, closing 
Makoto&#39;s door and sitting on the edge of the bed. Smiling slightly, 
she looked at them. &quot;I don&#39;t get you two. One minute, you fight worse 
than me and Usagi, then you&#39;re acting like lovers. Whats the deal?&quot;

Minako blushed deep crimson while Makoto just smiled. Makoto let go of 
Minako and Minako sat up. Makoto sat up, too, her legs still under the 
blanket.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna go get dressed,&quot; Minako said quickly, leaving the room. 
Makoto laughed and fell backwards back into the bed. Rei smiled more.

&quot;Are you two dating, Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Iie,&quot; Makoto said, still smiling. &quot;We just slept together last 
night.&quot; Makoto thought of how she said her words and began laughing 
again, as did Rei.

&quot;That sounded so wrong in so many ways!&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Makoto said in between laughing. &quot;But you knew what I 
meant.&quot;

Rei calmed down, but continued to smile. &quot;Hai. So, whats the deal with 
you two anyway?&quot;

&quot;Just good friends,&quot; Makoto said swinging her legs over the side of 
the bed then standing. Her jeans were un- fastened. She pulled them up 
slightly since they were sagging from her sleeping in them. Makoto 
walked over to the desk and retieved her green plaid shirt and tee 
shirt and put them on, the tee shirt under the green, button up plaid 
shirt. She then tucked both shirts into her jeans and zipped her jeans 
up, placing her belt around her waist to finish the process of getting 
dressed.

Rei laughed slightly as she watched Makoto get her wallet and place it 
in her back pocket.

&quot;Nani,&quot; Makoto asked, smiling a little.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe that, as much of a man as you act, you still look 
like a girl, thats all.&quot;

Makoto looked at Rei. &quot;Rei-chan, I AM a girl in case you didn&#39;t 
notice.&quot;

&quot;No, I mean in your appearnce. Well, your hair mostly,&quot; Rei said. 
&quot;Most gay girls I know that act really guyish have short hair. You 
still have long hair.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Makoto said, looking t her braided pony tail. It was true. Her 
hair was long enough to reach the middle of her back. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
why I have it long,&quot; Makoto admitted. &quot;Maybe I should get it cut 
sometime this week.&quot;

&quot;Its your choice,&quot; Rei said standing. &quot;I was just wondering anyway. 
Well, I better go get dressed, too.&quot; Rei then walked out of Makoto&#39;s 
room, closing the door behind her.

So give me one more chance
Darlin&#39; if you care for me
Let me win your love
&#39;Cause you were always there for me
If you care for me,
Be there for me

Ami sat at her desk in her bedroom, doing her homework. As she sat 
there writing a paper for her writting class, the phone rang.

&quot;Moshi, Moshi. Mizuno residence,&quot; Ami said, answering the phone.

&quot;Konnichi wa, Ami-chan,&quot; came a male voice over the phone.

Ami&#39;s eyes widened with surprise and happiness. &quot;Ryo-kun? Is that 
you?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Ami. It is.&quot;

&quot;Where are you? You sound so close.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m back in town for a few days.&quot;

&quot;Ryo? Whats wrong?&quot;

&quot;Turn your tv onto the news.&quot;

Ami, although confused, did as she was told. On the news was a girl 
Ami recognised, but couldn&#39;t place her name.

&quot;Thats Yumemi, the painter,&quot; Ryo said. &quot;She&#39;s missing.&quot;

&quot;Oh my.&quot;

&quot;The negaforce took her,&quot; Ryo said, shocking Ami.

&quot;Nani!? Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;How do you know,&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;Because they are after me, too.&quot;

&quot;Ryo,&quot; Ami said, panic rising in her voice. &quot;Where are you? I&#39;ll get 
my friends and we&#39;ll protect you.&quot;

&quot;Iie. This is destiney. I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;Ryo..&quot;

Before Ami could ask him once again where he was, Ryo had hung up the 
phone.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;And he just hung up on you with out saying where he was,&quot; Usagi said, 
placing a cookie in her mouth.

Ami nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;That does it,&quot; Rei said. &quot;We&#39;ll go look for him. If he has 
information on our enemy and what they are up to, we need to get to 
him before they do.&quot;

Usagi agrees, eating another cookie. Ami numbly nodded.

&quot;I&#39;ll go get Minako. I&#39;ll be right back,&#39; Rei said. She stood and 
walked out of her room and down the hall. Looking out, she saw 
Yuuchirou and Grampa having a snow ball fight.

She loved December weather.

Reaching the spare bedroom, she could hear Makoto and Minako inside 
laughing. Peeking inside, she saw what Makoto had brought with her, a 
playstaition.

Makoto was jerking the controller around while Minako was laying on 
the floor, holding her sides and laughing at Makoto while she tried to 
run from zombies.

&quot;He&#39;s gonna eat me,&quot; Makoto yelled, running from the attacking zombie, 
completly forgeting her character had a gun and amo.

Minako laughed harder at Makoto&#39;s statement, and Rei giggled slightly, 
wanting to watch them more.

Makoto slumped over slightly, her hands falling between her open legs, 
loosely holding the controller. Then, all at once, she clutched her 
heart and fell backwards.

&quot;Oh...he got me!&quot;

Minako laughed harder as did Rei. The two looked up from their places 
on the floor, still laughing slightly.

Makoto flung her arms up in the air and yelled, &quot;Konnichi wa, 
Rei-chan!&quot; However, when she did that, she lost her bablance and fell 
backwards again. Rei had to brace herself against the frame of the 
door as she laughed.

&quot;Minako,&quot; Rei said, trying to stop from laughing. &quot;We need your help 
to find Ryo.&quot;

&quot;Oh, is he back in town?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

Minako looked at Makoto and half smiled. &quot;I gotta go. See ya later, 
ok?&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Makoto said, dissappointed. She watched Minako walk past Rei 
and into the hall.

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot;

Rei looked at Makoto. &quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Would you like me to help?&quot;

Rei smiled slyly. &quot;Why? Do you want to spend more time with Minako?&quot;

Makoto only smiled. 

&quot;You can help if you want. Why don&#39;t you and Ami pair up?&quot;

Makoto stood up and shut off the game and tv. When she heard the 
suggestion of her and Ami hooking up, Makoto looked at Rei.

&quot;Uh..I don&#39;t think thats such a good idea, Rei-chan. She and I don&#39;t 
get along very well.&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Rei said. &quot;I know. Thats why I said it.&quot;

I like to play the queen of hearts and never thought I&#39;d lose
I rolled the dice but never showed my hand
I planned it out so perfectly,
So you&#39;d never leave a girl like me
I was a fool, but now I understand

------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto and Ami walked the strets of downtoan Tokyo together. Although 
the weather was beautiful with the falling flakes of snow, the tension 
between the two girls was not so pretty. Ami would walk somewaht 
behind Makoto, and not so close to her fearing Makoto would make a 
pass at her or try to rape her or something. Makoto just shrugged it 
off and stuffed her hands in her coat pockets.

After an hour passed, Makoto had finally had enough. Walking faster, 
then turning to stand in front of Ami, Makoto looked her in the eyes.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you likes gays?!&quot;

The sudden outburst had startled Ami out of her thoughts of finding 
Ryo. She looked up at Makoto and glared.

&quot;Its none of your business,&quot; Ami said looking across the street.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m *making* it my business,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;So I want to know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not telling you,&quot; Ami said sidestepping Makoto.

Makoto sighed and began walking with Ami once again. 

After a few moments silence, Makoto asked,&quot; So what does Ryo look 
like?&quot;

&quot;Brown hair and blue eyes,&quot; Ami answered without thinking much about 
it. &quot;He&#39;s about an inch or so taller than I am.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;You two like a couple?&quot;

Ami glared at Makoto out of the cornor of her eye.

&quot;I&#39;m not asking cause I want to date you or anything. I&#39;m just 
curious, is all,&quot; Makoto said, sweatdropping.

&quot;Iie, we&#39;re not. Just good friends.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Sugoi.&quot;

Ami rolled her eyes.

Makoto chanced a look at Ami. Ami, getting annoyed that Makoto was now 
staring at her, looked up to see Makoto wasn&#39;t even looking at her. 
Ami turned her head to look across the street and saw a brown headed 
boy running in the crowd.

&quot;Ryo!&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; Makoto said darting across the street, Ami following her.

Makoto followed Ryo into an alley and called out his name. He stopped 
and turned around to see the girl who called him, and when he did, he 
saw Ami turn the cornor.

&quot;Ami-chan!&quot; 

&quot;Ryo!&quot; Ami ran to him and hugged him tightly, afraid the negaverse 
would snatch him away from her any moment.

Makoto could only smile. She knew there was more to the relationship 
than Ami let on. 

&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; came a voice within the darkness of the alley. 
&quot;Isn&#39;t this touching.&quot;

Makoto, Ami, and Ryo looked up towards a fire escape, a lone figure 
standing there.

&quot;Mamoru,&quot; Ami whispered. Ryo looked at her from the cornor of his 
eyes.

Prince Endymion jumped down from the fire escape and landed in front 
of the trio. Ami stepped in front of Ryo, readying a fighting stance. 
Endymion sneered.

&quot;Girl,&quot; he said. &quot;Get out of the way and I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;

&quot;Blow off,&quot; Makoto declared cooly, walking to stand beside Ami. &quot;And 
*you* won&#39;t get hurt.&quot; She glanced at Ami from the cornor of her eyes, 
nodded towards the enterance of the alley and winked. Smiling, Makoto 
walked further ahead of Ami. Endymion grabbed the coller of her 
jacket.

&quot;What did you say?&quot;

Makot smiled. &quot;I told you to blow off or you&#39;d be hurt.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; he said, unbeliving. &quot;By who, you?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

Makoto smiled and with a qucik action jerked away from his grasp and 
swung a metal trashcan lid as hard as she could, hitting Endymion 
across the face. 

He stummbled and hit the wall, falling against it. Makoto threw the 
lid, hitting him again and followed Ami and Ryo out of the alley.

The three ran thru the crowds of people down the streets of Tokyo. 
They knew if that man stood back up, he&#39;d be very mad.

They raced past the amusment park, Ryo stopping. Makoto and Ami 
stopped and turned back.

&quot;Lets go in here,&quot; Ryo suggested.

After jumping the fence, Makoto wandered off away from Ami and Ryo. 
She knew Ami wanted to be alone with Ryo, so she made an excuse to 
leave. However she didn&#39;t wander far from them. 

She knew that man would come back for them.

Here is the law of the land
You play with fire and you&#39;ll get burned
Here is the lesson I&#39;ve learned
That you don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve got til it&#39;s gone

&quot;Ryo,&quot; Ami said after Makoto left. &quot;I don&#39;t like it here. Its too 
deserted.&quot;

&quot;Yea, I know,&quot; Ryo said. &quot;But I always wanted to bring you here...&quot; He 
leaned on the railing that circled the ferris wheel. &quot;..On a date.&quot;

Ami blinked at his confession. She walked up to him and stood by his 
side. He looked the other way, and she leaned her back against the 
rail.

They stayed that way for a few moments, in silence. Thoughts of the 
other running thru their minds.

&quot;I&#39;m going to just turn myself over,&quot; Ryo said quietly. Ami jerked her 
head up and looked at him in shock.

&quot;Nani?!&quot;

&quot;They want me, and they&#39;ll get me,&quot; he explained. &quot;But I&#39;ll only do it 
if they promise not to hurt you.&quot;

Ami smiled shyly and shook her head. &quot;Iie. The self sacrifice is nice 
and all, but I refuse to let you do that.&quot;

&quot;But, Ami-&quot;

&quot;No buts. If you do that, then you&#39;re helping them, even of you&#39;re 
trying to save me.&quot; She looked at him and smiled more. &quot;I won&#39;t let 
them take you.&quot;

&quot;Ami..&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;re wrong about that,&quot; said a voice above them. Ryo and 
Ami looked up and watched as the lights on the ferris wheel lit up, 
reveiling a man standing at the top. He jumped down and landed in 
front of them, pinnign them between the gate and himself. &quot;Dead 
wrong.&quot;

Ami stepped in front of Ryo, her henshin stick ready. Endymion just 
smiled cruelly.

&quot;Little girl, get out of my way before I kill you.&quot;

Ami swallowed the lump in her throat and was about to transform hen 
Makoto ran from out of no where, knocking Endymion down. She looked up 
at Ami and told her to get out of there.

Ami nodded and she and Ryo began to leave the park. However, Endymion 
had stood back up while Makot was distracted and had hit her with an 
energy blast, sending her to hit a wall.

Endymion then threw his black crystal into the air, a yellow beam of 
light shoting out and hitting Ryo in the back, incasing him inside of 
it.

&quot;Ryo!&quot; Ami watched as the crystal returned to Endymion. Without 
thinking much about it, she pulled out her henshin stick and yelled 
out, &quot;Mercury power, Make-up!&quot; In a swirl of water and bubbles, Mizuno 
Ami had transformed into Sailor Mercury. This hadn&#39;t phazed Endymion a 
bit.

&quot;I was wondering when you would change,&quot; he said cooly.

&quot;Give me the crystal,&quot; Mercury demanded. Endymion only sneered.

&quot;Iie.&quot;

&quot;Give me the crystal or you&#39;ll regret it.&quot;

Endymion sneered again. &quot;Empty threats, you and I both know it.&quot;

Mercury looked at him, her gaze unwavering. She knew she wouldn&#39;t beat 
him, not with her weak powers. She had to do something quick.

&quot;She may make empty threats, but I don&#39;t!&quot; Both Endymion and Mercury 
looked over at a tall figure that was walking out of shadows, another 
figure following closely behind her.

&quot;Who are you,&quot; Endymion demanded.

&quot;I am Sailor Jupiter,&quot; she said, stepping out of the shadows. &quot;And I 
am one senshi that you don&#39;t want to mess with.&quot;

Endymion looked at her. &quot;And why is that?&quot;

&quot;Cause I&#39;ll kill you,&quot; Jupiter said, an evil smile on her face.

Endymion swallowed the lump in his throat and drew his sword. &quot;Don&#39;t 
bet on it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Jupiter said before charging him. Endymion threw out 
his sword, but hit nothing as Jupiter did a back flip over his head. 
Turning to face her, his face was met by her foot as she did a round 
house kick.

He flew back and did a few rolls on the ground before stopping and 
standing again. He threw an engery blast towards her. She jumped out 
of the way, easily dodgeing the attack.

She powered up her lightening attack and threw it at him. He dodged, 
but barely. His mind raced. He knew he wouldn&#39;t defeat her if he 
didn&#39;t do something tragic. His mind thought of a plan and soon had 
one. He quickly put it into action.

He threw another attack towards Jupiter, hopeing she&#39;d jump to the 
left and not the right.

She jumped to the left.

Smiling evily, he powered another attack. But this time, he threw it 
towards Mercury, who was still watching the battle.

Mercury was hit since she was unable to prepare for such an unsudden 
attack. Endymion threw another at the fallen senshi. However, Sailor 
Jupiter was able to run and grab Mercury before the second attack 
could hit her.

This was what Endymion wanted.

When Jupiter landed with the weak Mercury in her arms, Endymion threw 
another attack and hit Jupiter in her turned away back, slamming both 
her and Mercury into a wall. Jupiter felt the blast and turned her 
body slightly, taking most of the hit from the wall. Endymion then 
coninued to throw attacks at them, Jupiter taking them all in the 
back. Her hands were braced againt the wall as so she didn&#39;t slam into 
Mercury.

Mercury was sure if something didn&#39;t happen soon, Jupiter would die 
from the continuous attacks. No sooner had she thought this, ahd she 
heard a loud roaring noise. Both she and Jupiter looked towards the 
left and out of the shadows ran the large, blue tiger that was with 
Jupiter the last time. He jumped and slashed at Endymion, who vanished 
and reappeared in a safer location, far away from the tiger.

Endymion sneered and looked back towards Jupiter and Mercury. Jupiter 
was standing once again, although it was abvious she was in much pain. 
Her arms and back were burnt and bloody, and her breathing was quick 
and shallow.

Endymion&#39;s smile was pure evil. &quot;Whats the matter Jupiter? I thought 
you said you didn&#39;t make empty threats?&quot;

The amazon looked up at the evil prince, her body glowing green. She 
smiled back at the prince, her smile just as evil.

&quot;I don&#39;t.&quot; She then threw her head back and screamed, her body being 
engulfed by the green light. She doubled over, her back begining to 
mis shapen. The light grew in intensity, then vanished as snow white 
wings with emerald tips srang from her back. Jupiter stood up 
straight, her senshi uniform gone, now replaced with a black sports 
bra, black pants and army boots. Her hair was down, and dark green. 
Her skin tone a dark brown.

Mercury looked on in disbelief as did Endymion. Soon there was a 
roaring noise again and Mercury and Endymion looked over at the tiger. 
His body seemed concreted to ground except for his back, which was 
arched highly into the air. Soon, white feathered wings sprouted from 
his back as well, his front body moving up. He was soon standing on 
his hind legs like a human, a loin cloth magically appearing around 
his waist.

&quot;Its Yung hu and Mitsuakai,&quot; Mercury said in disbelief.

Mitsuakai took advantage of Endymion&#39;s distraction of Yung Hu&#39;s 
transformation and jumped up and spread her wings, zooming towards 
him. She circled her arms around him and slammed him into the concrete 
of the ground. Mitsuakai jumped away from him.

Endymion shakily stood to his feet. &quot;You can&#39;t beat me, bitch! I have 
the dark crystal...I&#39;ll resuect the dark shadow!&quot;

Mitsuakai smirked. &quot;Check your pockets, prince!&quot; She then opened her 
closed hand, a dark crystal falling from it. Endymion checked all of 
his pockets, realising he didn&#39;t have the crystal any more. Mitsuakai 
smiled and tossed the crystal behind her, Mercury catching it. Mercury 
them smiled, and smashed the jem onto the ground, all the stolen 
bodies scattering in seven different rays of light. Ryo, in a yellow 
beam, landed a few feet from Mercury.

Mercury ran to him and held him close to her, Endymion disappearing 
from the fight. Mitsuakai and Yung hu inched their way out of lights 
of the park as they heard the other senshi show up.

What happened here,&quot; Mars cried out.

Mercury looked up and saw her friends. &quot;Ryo, Makoto and I were 
attacked.&quot;

Venus&#39;s face paled. &#39;Where&#39;s Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;There she is,&quot; Sailor Moon cried out. Makoto walked out of the 
shadows, rubbing the back of her head with her hand. 

venus ran up to her worriedly. 

Makoto smiled slightly and whispered, &quot;I&#39;m fine. Just a bump on the 
head.&quot; Venus smiled. Makoto, however grimiced.

Her back was bleeding greatly.
