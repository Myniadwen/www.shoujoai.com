<h1>World in Fragments (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/worldfrag-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>She felt the cold wall behind her, felt the hot body in front of her. 
She smelled the alcohol, the dirt and the sweat. Nausea increased in 
her belly but she knew that she wasn&#146;t allowed to threw up her lunch.

&#147;You little whore.&#148;

She heard the low voice next to her ear. Hot breathe run over her 
cheeks and she turned her head away. But she knew that she couldn&#146;t 
turn away from him. She pressed her closed eyelids harder together and 
tried to think of nothing. Especially not at him.

Her shirt was ripped off and she felt another cold on her body. &#147;You 
little...&#148;

She didn&#146;t listen to his voice. Her fists were clenched, touched the 
dirty wall behind her. She wanted to beat him down, to push him away, 
to save herself. But at the same time she knew that she couldn&#146;t. The 
price for her own freedom would have been too high.

Again she felt the cold wall behind and now the cold wind in front of 
her body. Again she felt his hands touching her rudely. Then her world 
exploded and all remained was pain. Never ending humiliation.

Haruka sat upright in her bed, looking wildly into the darkness of the 
bedroom. Her breathe was fast and her pyjama wet. Sweaty strands of 
her short blonde hairs fell in her green eyes that stared shocked at 
something only she could see. Then she slowly realized where she was 
and calmed herself down. But she couldn&#146;t oppress the trembling of her 
body. Nor the silent sobs that tried to escape her throat.

The senshi of the wind slowly turned her head and looked down at her 
girlfriend who laid next to her in the wide bed and slept deep and 
tight. It had been an exiting evening with Hotaru. The little girl 
felt weaker in the evening and cried when she had to take her bath. 
She didn&#146;t want to and as the hours passed the fever returned. It was 
late after midnight before the future senshi of death finally fell 
asleep and they could go to bed, too. What will you do when Hotaru&#146;s 
fine again and she wants to love you?

Haruka swallowed hard but couldn&#146;t touch her Michiru. She didn&#146;t find 
an answer as she find none for so many questions. That were haunting 
her down every day. Like the nightmares that haunted her down every 
night.

It&#146;s just a silly nightmare!

Haruka rose slowly from the bed and went over to the bathroom. She 
fluctuate and almost stumbled over her blanket that laid on the 
carpet. She swallowed hard as she closed the door silently behind her 
and stepped into the shower. As she did so many times the last nights. 
For over four weeks now.

It&#146;s just a silly nightmare.

Haruka cowered down on the cold underground and switched on the 
shower. She knew too well that it hadn&#146;t been just a silly 
nightmare...

The young racer oppressed a desperate sob as she covered her burning 
face with her ice cold hands and welcomed the darkness that surrounded 
her with a sudden. That also scared her a lot. She kept cowering in 
the corner of the cabin and tried to think of nothing. But as always 
it didn&#146;t work. Still she heard the rude words in her ears. Still she 
felt the pain flashing through her body.

I&#146;ve been too weak!

She swallowed hard and bowed her head. Her shoulder hang and she 
didn&#146;t even feel the cool water running down her body. She didn&#146;t even 
mention that she still wore her pyjama. Now it was really wet.

It&#146;s over a month now...

The doctor told her that she would get the results of the test within 
four weeks. That had been one day after the battle. Haruka was very 
frightened every day she opened her mailbox. But there was no letter 
from the hospital. Only advertising and some fan letters for her or 
Michiru.

What if it&#146;s positive? 

She swallowed hard and didn&#146;t want to think at Himme-chan and her 
Michi-chan.

That would be my death sentence...

The young car racer shook her head in disbelieve and wet strands of 
her short hairs pasted to her frowned forehead. For two years she had 
have all she ever wanted. All she ever needed.

And now all this should be over?

She didn&#146;t hear that the door was opened. She didn&#146;t see that the 
light was switched on. She didn&#146;t feel that the water changed it&#146;s 
temperature. It wasn&#146;t icy any longer. Now it became warmer and more 
comfortable. 

Haruka winced wildly as she suddenly felt two soft arms embracing her 
shaking body. She wanted to scream. To beat the intruder. To free 
herself. To run away until she would reach the end of the world &#150; and 
die there. But at the next moment she heard the known, soft voice and 
knew that there was no reason for running away.

&#147;Hush.&#148; Was all Michiru said while she embraced her lover from behind, 
pulled her closer and rocked her carefully. She leaned her head 
against Haruka&#146;s shoulder and could feel how the taller senshi 
trembled fiercely. For a long time Michiru did nothing more than 
simply holding her girlfriend tight. Comforting her the way she could. 
Rocking her, stroking her. Kissing her neck. Haruka didn&#146;t say 
anything. She simply sat there in the warm shower and felt her Michiru 
by her side. Felt her girlfriend&#146;s love. And suddenly asked herself is 
she would be ever able again to love her &#150; not only mental, but also 
with her body.

As long as the test...

Silently she started to sob and felt how the embracement got tighter.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; asked Michiru after another long while and carefully 
took Haruka&#146;s icy hands into her own warm ones. She loved those hands. 
There were strong but at the same time very sensitive.

&#147;Had a nightmare.&#148; Mumbled Haruka and Michiru couldn&#146;t see her lover&#146;s 
expression because wet strands of short blonde hair covered a pale 
face with shadows. &#147;I...&#148; The young car racer took a deep breathe and 
swallowed hard. &#147;I don&#146;t wanna loose you.&#148; Her voice was very low and 
very shaky. &#147;Neither you nor Himme-chan...&#148; Now the voice broke and 
was replaced by another silent sob. Michiru automatically pulled her 
Ruka tighter to her warm body and covered her neck again with little, 
loving kisses.

&#147;Hey, don&#146;t stress yourself, Ruka. Hotaru&#146;s feeling fine. Nothing 
happened to her during the fight. You could beat those guys down 
before they could have hurt our princess. And the flu&#146;s over soon. 
Chibiusa&#146;s already in school again and believe me till the next 
week-end our tomboy will be wild again.&#148; Whispered Michiru and sighed 
deeply. &#147;The attack of the guy wasn&#146;t your fault, Ruka. And that they 
threaten Hotaru wasn&#146;t your fault, too. You defended her, you brought 
her to hospital and you made sure that she has no nightmares over that 
day. So stop your own nightmares, Ruka. The guys aren&#146;t worth it.&#148;

Haruka bowed her head a little bit more but didn&#146;t respond anything. 
This was the right time to tell her lover the truth, but she simply 
couldn&#146;t. She was too afraid of how Michiru would react.

I don&#146;t wanna hurt her.

She knew that life wouldn&#146;t be the same again after she&#146;d told her. It 
wasn&#146;t the same for herself after that day. But it wasn&#146;t fair to ruin 
Michiru&#146;s life, too.

That&#146;s all my fault. Because I had been too careless. Now I have to 
carry the consequences.

But slowly she realized that those consequences were too heavy for her 
to carry. To carry them alone...

Michiru hold her Ruka for the rest of the night, listened to her 
silent sobs and tried to calm her down. But suddenly she was very 
concerned about her. Haruka had never been that desperate. Not even 
during the final battle with Mistress 9 when they thought that they 
should kill Hotaru. Their Himme-chan they already loved as much as if 
the little girl would have been their own daughter. What&#146;s wrong with 
her?

But Michiru didn&#146;t ask. She knew that she wouldn&#146;t get an answer 
today. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the next week. When Haruka was ready to 
tell her what was haunting her really in her nightmares.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, Ruka, we&#146;re always here for you. Himme-chan and I. I 
won&#146;t ever leave you.&#148; Whispered Michiru and hold her girlfriend 
tighter as she started even more to tremble. 

Haruka didn&#146;t turn around to face her lover. She simply sat there, 
feeling the warm water on her skin, her girlfriend&#146;s warm body next to 
her own one. Her dark green eyes widened as she heard the silent 
promise from her Michi-chan. She opened her mouth but she was unable 
to speak a word. To move. To do anything else than trembling.

What shall I do when I am the one who is forced to leave you?

***

It rained the whole day. So the whole school decided to have their 
festival inside. Although they couldn&#146;t grill and the campfire wasn&#146;t 
allowed in the corridors it was a loud, happy and exiting school 
festival.

&#147;Look, what we&#146;ve made!&#148; Chibiusa winked wildly at them as they 
entered the old building. It was very high and compared to the weather 
outside very warm. But Chibiusa was wearing a very thick pullover 
because her future mother didn&#146;t want her to get ill again. Nor did 
Ikkuko.

&#147;Hello, honey.&#148; Chibiusa left her class&#146;s position and came over to 
them. The little girl laughed happily as she jumped into her best 
friend&#146;s arms and the future Princess of Crystal Tokyo swirled around 
with her.

&#147;Dolls!&#148; screamed Hotaru exited after Chibiusa let her go. The future 
senshi of death looked at the self made dolls. Boys and girls. They 
were wearing coloured kimonos and suits and had short and long hairs. 
And a big smile on their faces.

&#147;Do you want one, honey?&#148; Chibiusa looked for a doll and gave it to a 
wild nodding Hotaru. The small girl jumped for luck and embraced her 
best friend tightly.

It looks like her.

Haruka looked down at the doll. It was a girl with shoulder long black 
hairs and a violet dress. It had a wild grin on it&#146;s face and the dark 
eyes sparkled. Like the ones of her daughter right now while she 
stared proudly at her new toy and then at her parents. And at last at 
her best friend.

&#147;&#146;gato.&#148; Declared the little girl and laughed happily.

&#147;She&#146;s got a doll and I didn&#146;t!&#148; Haruka and Michiru turned around as 
they heard the angry voice of a seventeen year old girl. Light blue 
eyes stared angry at innocent pink ones.

&#147;They aren&#146;t free, Usagi. You have to buy them and you already wasted 
all your money. Without Haruka you wouldn&#146;t even had the money to get 
into the zoo!&#148; snapped Chibiusa back and greeted some students who 
passed by quickly. They knew Chibiusa&#39;s older &gt;sister&lt; and they knew 
too well how loud they both could scream in an argument.

Usagi blushed deeply and tears filled her eyes.

&#147;But Hotaru didn&#146;t pay them, too and they&#146;re so cute!&#148; Now she really 
started to cry.

&#147;Hotaru-honey is my best friend. And she doesn&#146;t have any pocket 
money. Ikkuko gave you enough but you wasted it on silly toys, mangas 
and sweets. And now you&#146;ll have to wait another week until you&#146;ll get  
new money!&#148; Chibiusa nodded determined and stepped warning between the 
toys and her crying future mother. Mamoru came after his girlfriend. 
Shortly he glanced at Michiru and Haruka and shrugged helpless but 
knowing his shoulders. He knew that he couldn&#146;t interfere between them 
so he simply embraced his girlfriend and kept silent. The outer senshi 
exchanged glances and Haruka nodded slightly.

&#147;Shall we buy you one? As an early Christmas present?&#148; asked the young 
violinist and immediately the tears stopped falling.

&#147;This is your seriousness, isn&#146;t it?&#148; asked Usagi and looked with her 
big eyes at the older young woman and a smile appeared on her face 
that was full of hope. Full of love. That belonged to Sailor Moon, 
their future Queen.

&#147;Hai, otherwise we would have to see you crying the whole day.&#148; Teased 
Haruka and did a exaggerating gesture as if she was praying to the 
mighty gods.

&#147;You&#146;re too good for this world.&#148; Growled Chibiusa but handled them a 
toy. It looked like Usagi: Two long blonde plaits, one white dress and 
a giant grinning mouth.

&#147;It&#146;s so cute! Arigato!&#148; Before the outer senshi could react the girl 
had embraced them both. Then she turned away to show her new toy to 
her boyfriend. Mamoru smiled thankful at gave his Usako a short but 
loving kiss on her now redden cheeks.

Michiru only frowned as she felt how Haruka winced away as Usagi 
embraced them in her great joy. An expression laid on the taller 
woman&#146;s face Michiru couldn&#146;t define.

But before she could ask Haruka had turned away and took her small 
daughter into her arms again. Hotaru played exited with her new toy 
and showed it to her papa. The young car racer only smiled loving down 
at her.

Two days passed since that night when Michiru found her Ruka at the 
ground of the shower. She tried to talk to her lover again about that 
incident but Haruka kept silent. Every time the young violinist wanted 
to discuss with her, Haruka was very busy with a sudden. Soon there&#146;ll 
be the final race and she wanted to win this year&#146;s Grand Prix of 
Japan. She left the house early in the morning, trained a lot and came 
back late in the evening. We didn&#146;t even have the time to take a 
shower together.

Michiru frowned again.

She didn&#146;t even touch and tease me how she always does. 

Thoughtful she stared at her lover and watched how she talked tenderly 
to her daughter who looked up at her with her big dark eyes. Love was 
written over her face all over. Love and unconditional trust.

It&#146;s five weeks now that we slept the last time together. Hai, the 
last weeks had been very busy. Haruka&#39;s races for the Grand Prix, 
Michiru&#146;s beneficial concerts, Chibiusa&#146;s and Hotaru&#146;s illness. But 
somehow it was strange this time. Stranger than it had been every time 
before when they had to do a lot and simply didn&#146;t find the time to 
share more than some kisses. Sometimes Michiru almost got the feeling 
that her Ruka was suddenly scared of her touches. She winced away each 
time she embraced her under the blanket. She left the shower very 
quickly when Michiru came into the bathroom to join her. Suddenly she 
wore tracksuits in the light house and preferred dark, inconspicuous, 
wide clothes. For weeks I didn&#146;t see her running around in just a 
t-shirt. Or in our sleeping room &#150; naked. Haruka loved it to tease her 
around in that way &#150; until she was naked, too. But now she avoided it 
wherever she could. She even changed her clothes in the bathroom &#150; 
with a locked door.

I&#146;ll have to talk to her &#150; seriously!

Michiru sighed slightly and looked into shinning blue eyes. She knew 
that this wasn&#146;t the right place nor the right time. This was 
Chibiusa&#146;s school festival and Michiru needed a time to talk to her 
Ruka on her own. At that moment the inner senshi and even Setsuna who 
was allowed to leave earlier from work, came to them and declared that 
they wanted to see everything of that nice school.

The other agreed and soon Michiru forgot about her doubts.

But only for some hours.

***

She yawned oppressed as she stumbled downstairs and opened the heavy 
entrance door. She shivered as she ran towards the mailbox. Wild 
November wind was playing with her long sea green hairs and with a 
determined gesture she grabbed all the letters, the advertising and 
the newspaper and sneaked back into the warm house by the sea. Michiru 
often froze in the cold winter&#146;s times so there were heatings overall 
in the house and even in the coldest winter it was at least as warm as 
spring in the huge walls covered with drawings.

Michiru read the senders while she walked over to the kitchen. Hotaru 
was still sleeping and the girl wouldn&#146;t wake up before nine o&#146;clock. 
It was Sunday morning and this week it was her turn to make breakfast. 
Haruka was still under the shower and in about ten minutes she would 
come downstairs to tease her around that the rolls weren&#146;t ready now, 
that the coffee wasn&#146;t black enough and the marmalade, the senshi of 
wind bought by herself, was too sweet. 

Or she will simply sit down and watch me in silence as she did the 
past weeks. Michiru sighed oppressed and wanted to put the letters on 
the table as her eyes caught another letter. A small one with a formal 
imprint. It was addressed to Haruka and it was certainly not a fan 
letter or a bill of her fast race car.

&#147;What...&#148; whispered Michiru and reached for a knife to open the 
letter. It took her three attempts till she got it.

There were no secrets between them and shortly after Haruka moved into 
the light house by the sea five years ago, she declared to her 
girlfriend that she was allowed to open her letters &#150; as long as it 
was not Christmas time and she would discover a present that would be 
for her &#150; but not before Christmas Eve!

Michiru&#146;s heart stopped to beat as she read the few lines. She frowned 
her head and automatically sat down on a chair. She swallowed hard and 
couldn&#146;t fight back her tears who filled her deep blue eyes. That&#146;s 
why she behaved so strange. So differently. So hurt... Oh, Ruka!

&#147;Morning...&#148; mumbled Haruka and crept into the kitchen. She wore a 
dark tracksuit and her hairs were still wet. Slowly she opened the 
fridge to drink some milk and frowned as she mentioned that she 
couldn&#146;t smell any rolls. Nor coffee. She yawned and turned around to 
her girlfriend. And froze in motion.

&#147;What happened?&#148; she asked alarmed and felt suddenly very weak. There 
was something in her lover&#146;s eyes that made her shiver. Then she saw 
the letter in Michiru&#146;s hands.

Over five weeks now...

&#147;You&#146;ve got post from Dr. Sagurasa-san.&#148; Declared the young violinist 
with a quiet voice that sounded strange in her ears. Haruka felt like 
the ground disappeared and she would start to fall. The world spun 
around her and she seized hard on the kitchen&#146;s cupboard. The milk 
still holding in her suddenly trembling hands. Her face became whiter 
than the wall and Michiru looked deeply into terrified green eyes. 
Then Haruka asked in a silent, almost insensible voice.

&#147;And the result?&#148;

Michiru shook her head as she saw how important that answer seemed to 
be for her girlfriend. For her lover. Her one and only woman in her 
whole life.

Why should she do such a silly test? The answer is clear! &#147;What have 
you expected, you baka? It&#146;s negative.&#148; She declared and crumbled the 
paper in her now icy hands. Straight she looked into Haruka&#146;s pale 
face and didn&#146;t see nothing else than blank horror and then endless 
relief.

Then Haruka turned her head away. &#147;Of course it&#146;s negative! It&#146;s an 
AIDS-test, Haruka. You only can get AIDS when you&#146;d get blood and you 
never had a dangerous operation. I was your first lover and I know 
that you&#146;d never betray me. So why did you do that silly test?&#148; wanted 
Michiru to know but Haruka didn&#146;t hear her words. She didn&#146;t listen to 
her after the second sentence. After the word that made her sure that 
she would be able to grow old with her Michiru. To see her Hotaru 
growing up. To lead a normal life again &#150; one day.

Negative.

&#147;Thank goddess...&#148; she whispered and tears burned in her green eyes. 
The milk escaped her trembling hands and landed on the ground. Soon it 
founded a tiny sea of white fluid.

Negative.

Her legs couldn&#146;t carry her any longer. So she gave in her dizzy 
feelings and went down on her knees. The world spun around her even 
faster but she didn&#146;t care about it. All she heard was the one single 
word in her mind. Over and over again.

Negative.

&#147;Thank goddess...&#148; she stammered again and covered her face with her 
cold hands and started desperately to giggle. Soon it turned into 
sobbing but there were no tears running down her cheeks. She was still 
too shocked from the good news.

After that hell. After those long five weeks. Left alone in ignorance.

Negative.

Haruka closed her eyes and bowed her head. Thankful that god had mercy 
to let her live more than just a few years or months... She didn&#146;t 
think about Michiru anymore who watched her in blank horror nor did 
she think of Hotaru who would awake during the next hour.

&#147;Ruka...&#148; Michiru whispered and looked down at her lover who reacted 
so strange. So unreal but at the same time so real.

As if she really expected that the test could be positive...

Slowly the young violinist came to her feet. The letter fell unseen on 
the ground. Crumbled. Michiru knew something about AIDS. She already 
gave beneficial concerts for infected people. Children and adults. Men 
and women. There were only two ways to get AIDS: To get blood from an 
infected person or to have sex, what ever kind of sex, with him or 
her. And Michiru knew for sure that Haruka didn&#146;t have any complicate 
operations she needed blood during the past five years. So there was 
only one possibility left...

&#147;Ruka...?&#148; Suddenly Michiru&#146;s voice was very shaky as she came over to 
her lover and kneeled down next to her. She took Haruka&#146;s icy hands in 
her own cold ones and forced her lover to look up at her. There was no 
tomboy grin anymore on that face that was almost as pale as the wall 
behind her. There was no joke at those white lips. There was no wall 
anymore hiding Haruka&#146;s real feelings behind. Her deep blue eyes 
looked directly into dark green ones. All she saw now were fear, 
horror and sadness. And anger. And hate.

&#147;They didn&#146;t just beat you down, Ruka.&#148; Whispered Michiru and the 
realization seemed to make her heart break. Tears filled her eyes as 
she saw how her lover slightly shook her head and lowered her look. To 
stare at everything but her girlfriend. Her green eyes were cloudy and 
her voice was nothing more than a broken whisper as Haruka finally 
answered. 

&#147;No, they didn&#146;t.&#148; She took a deep breathe and clenched her fists 
around Michiru&#146;s hands as if she was her only life line. &#147;They raped 
me.&#148; The last words were so quietly that the young violinist almost 
missed them. But on the other hand they were so loud that Michiru 
wanted to put her hands on her ears. She didn&#146;t. She simply hold the 
ones of her lover and swallowed hard. Then she let her tears fall. For 
Haruka who wasn&#146;t obviously able to do it yet. Who was still too 
shocked to cry.

Now she knows it. 

Haruka bit hard on her lower lip until she tasted salty blood. She 
didn&#146;t want to give up. She didn&#146;t want to hurt her Michi-chan the 
same way they did hurt her. But she knew she did.

And after those horrible five weeks she knew that she had to do it. 
Otherwise she would have been broken by all the nightmares. The 
memories. The voices that were haunting her down. Like a wild animal. 
Without having a chance of escape.

&#147;Ruka...&#148; She felt how Michiru let go off her hands and took her into 
her arms in a strong, never-ending embrace. Michiru leaned her head 
against Haruka&#146;s and started quietly to sob.

&#147;I didn&#146;t want to make you cry.&#148; Whispered the young car racer after a 
while Michiru calmed down a little bit and Haruka had her voice under 
her control again. Well, at least she was able to say some words 
without only choking.

&#147;Is that the reason why you didn&#146;t tell me first?&#148; asked Michiru and 
turned a bit to see directly into her lover&#146;s still pale face. Into 
desperate green eyes. &#147;Is that the reason why you didn&#146;t tell me about 
your nightmares? About your sudden shame? About your fear to love me?&#148; 

Haruka took another deep breathe and searched in Michiru&#146;s face. All 
she found was deep sorrow, understanding and love. Deep love. 
Unconditional love.

&#147;Hai..&#148; whispered Haruka and searched for the right words. Michiru 
kept silent until she found them. &#147;I... I didn&#146;t want to poison you. 
If.. if he&#146;d really infected me with AIDS I didn&#146;t want to infect you, 
too. Our princess needs us. To loose me would have been very hard for 
her. But... but to loose you, too, that would... would have been too 
much for her. She already lost her real father and... she...&#148; helpless 
Haruka shrugged her shoulders and leaned her head against Michiru&#146;s 
shoulder and stared down at the other woman&#146;s lap. Michiru still wore 
her thin sleeping shirt but Haruka didn&#146;t ask her if she was cold. If 
she wanted to change her clothes. Because if she would go now, leave 
her girlfriend alone, Haruka wouldn&#146;t survive it.

Not now. Not yet. Never again.

&#147;And so you took that burden on your own and kept silent.&#148; Michiru 
stroke thoughtfully through the soft blonde strands and more tears ran 
down her cheeks.

&#147;Hai...&#148;

Again silence evolved between them and all that was heard was the 
appeasing rushes of the near ocean and the hungry screams of the sea 
birds outside. Fighting against a rough nature, fighting against a 
wild November&#146;s wind.

Inside there was another fight. An inner fight.

&#147;Do you want to speak about it?&#148; asked Michiru after a long while and 
felt how Haruka pulled herself closer. 

There was another long silence and the young violinist already thought 
that she wouldn&#146;t get an answer today, maybe that she would never get 
one at all, when the young car racer started silently to tell her 
about the things that happened at that day over five weeks ago. Her 
voice was very silent and almost insensible. But Michiru knew that it 
wasn&#146;t. Not really.

&#147;It was late that evening. You already prepared the tomato soup when I 
caught Himme-chan and left the house. I drove to the central parking 
space and decided to take a short cut. It was late and I was in a 
hurry so I didn&#146;t see that this short cut wasn&#146;t one of the best 
streets of Tokyo. Indeed it was one of the worst. But I didn&#146;t think  
much about it. I just entered it and counted my money. I forgot my 
cheque card at home and wondered if it would be enough for our 
dinner.&#148; Haruka took another deep breathe and slightly shook her head 
against Michiru&#146;s breasts. &#147;I was so blind. So naive. So... so 
careless. They followed me. I guess they had seen me on the parking 
space and thought that I had a lot of money with me because of our 
silver Ferrari. They where suddenly there. Without any sound or sign. 
They grabbed Himme-chan out of the pram before I could react and one 
of the men hold a knife a her throat. Hell, she looked so helpless. 
And so terrified...&#148; Haruka shook her head again and her fists 
clenched in Michiru&#146;s lap. Michiru didn&#146;t reply anything. She simply 
stroke her lover&#146;s hairs and listened to her rude, final words. Crying 
in silence.

&#147;They wanted money, but all I had were only some coins for the cheese. 
And some flowers for you. White roses.&#148; Michiru bit on her lips as she 
heard her Ruka&#146;s words, but she didn&#146;t interrupt her. &#147;They were very 
angry and one of the men beat Himme-chan. They were two men, maybe 
brothers. One was smaller than me and thinner. The other one was half 
a head taller and almost fat. And stronger. Of course I wanted to help 
Himme-chan who screamed and fainted. But the taller man held me back 
and we fought. I don&#146;t know how it happened but he realized that I am 
a woman and grinned that wicked grin. That bad grin as he declared 
that I could pay him in another way. That I could pay him for... for 
letting Himme-chan alive.&#148; Haruka swallowed again and the nausea 
increased inside her body. She wondered when it was time to get on her 
feet and to threw up the few things she ate for dinner.

&#147;I saw all the blood that covered Himme-chan&#146;s face! Her eyes were 
closed and she was so pale! I was so scared about her, that they would 
really kill her, that it didn&#146;t matter to me what he would do with me. 
I only wanted Himme-chan to take into the next hospital and to make 
sure that she would be healthy again. Hell, Michi-chan, I would have 
never survived it loosing her. Because of my careless.&#148; Haruka pressed 
her eyelids hard together but her eyes were still dry. She felt how 
Michiru&#146;s hand slipped under her dark tracksuit top and caressed 
tenderly her sweaty back. Tenderly and calming.

&#147;So I simply let him do what he wanted to do with me. He called me bad 
names and beat me while he...&#148; Haruka trembled even more and Michiru 
stopped caressing but hold her tight. As tight as she never had done 
before. Afraid that she would lose her Ruka just because of that rude 
man. &#147;Hell, Michi-chan... it hurt so much. And it seemed to take him 
so endless long minutes until he was finished. He kicked me one last 
time and then let go off me. The other man didn&#146;t want me. He said 
that I&#146;d look like a man and that he wasn&#146;t gay... Then... then they 
let Himme-chan down and laughed angry at me. Then they walked away. I 
felt... I was so ashamed, Michi-chan. I wanted to die. But there was 
Himme-chan. I took her and went to the hospital. Well, you.. you know 
the rest of the story. And now...&#148; Haruka sobbed oppressed and Michiru 
hold her even tighter. Suddenly Haruka raised her head and looked 
directly into Michiru&#146;s wet face. &#147;And now you know what nightmares 
were haunting me down. I... I was so scared of being infected with 
AIDS, of dying during the next years. Of never seeing Hotaru at the 
altar one day. Never seeing... seeing you as an old woman... old woman 
by my side that made me... me feel so... so bad.&#148;

&#147;The test&#146;s negative.&#148; Remembered Michiru her girlfriend and realized 
that her voice was as shaky as Haruka&#146;s, too.

&#147;Hai...&#148; A thin smile appeared on the young racer&#146;s face but it 
disappeared at the next moment. &#147;It&#146;s all my fault, Michi-chan. I&#146;ve 
been so careless and now... I never... I never wanted to betray you. 
You&#146;re my only... my only....&#148; Michiru took Haruka&#146;s hot face in her 
icy hands and forced her too look back into her face. Determined she 
interrupted the unsure stammer with a light, but loving kiss. Their 
lips only touched and they stayed in that position for another long 
while.

&#147;At least he didn&#146;t force me to kiss him.&#148; Said Haruka after the kiss 
ended. Then she opened her fists, raised her hands and wiped away the 
tears from her lover&#146;s cheeks.

But he forced me to...

Michiru who saw her thoughts in her sad expression, sighed deeply and 
more tears were running down her cheeks.

&#147;Gomen, Ruka. You went through hell and I couldn&#146;t help you!&#148; Her eyes 
widened as she saw a thin, but honest smile on the other one&#146;s pale 
face. It was the most beautiful smile she had ever seen. And at the 
same time the saddest.

&#147;You did, Michi-chan.&#148; Declared Haruka and embraced her again softly, 
felt how Michiru pulled her determined closer. Hold her tighter.

&#147;You do. The whole time. &#145;Cause you&#146;re here. For me. With me.&#148;

At that moment Michiru started openly to cry again. 

Both of them new that the nightmare wasn&#146;t over now. None of them knew 
that it had only started.

***

&#147;Do you remember the concert I wanted to give at the weekend?&#148; asked 
Michiru and stripped her clothes. It had been a busy week with the 
inner senshi. There had been a talent competition and the girls were 
driving everyone crazy, because they wanted to win it &#150; the price was 
a two day trip in the mountains. Especially Minako was very, very 
crazy. They helped them to practice dancing, singing and acting. They 
often laughed &#150; even Haruka had to smile a bit &#150; when Usagi tried it 
desperately and failed. But at the end the couple Minako and Makoto 
won and they all could drive into the mountains. That had been the 
moment they all realized that they didn&#146;t have skis and didn&#146;t know 
how to do skiing...

&#147;Hai.&#148; Haruka laid already in their bed under the thick blankets. It 
was cold outside and the grey sky promised snow. It was the end of 
November and whole Japan waited for snow. They all hoped for white 
Christmas and after Sylvester for a quick spring. As always.

&#147;I cancelled it.&#148;

&#147;Nani?&#148;

Surprised green eyes looked up into smiling blue ones.

&#147;I donated some money to the foundation for ill children and said that 
I couldn&#146;t take part in it because I am ill.&#148; Michiru said and brushed 
her long sea green hairs. She was still naked and Haruka watched her 
silent in the moonlight that shone through the now closed window. It 
was too cold outside to let it opened the whole night.

She looks so beautiful.

Michiru turned towards the senshi of the wind swallowed automatically. 
The moonlight covered her sea green hairs and she looked like an 
angel.

My angel.

Haruka watched how she came over to the bed. Still naked. It didn&#146;t 
look as if she wanted to pull her night shirt over her certainly 
freezing body.

My guardian angel...

&#147;You never cancelled a concert since I know you. I don&#146;t think that 
your manager believes you.&#148; Teased Haruka and raised one eyebrow as 
Michiru crept under the blanket next to her.

&#147;It&#146;s alike what he thinks. It&#146;s the first concert I cancel since my 
parents died and that&#146;s almost ten years ago. One concert in ten year 
is fair for my fans.&#148; She smiled loving down at her girlfriend and 
gave her a light kiss. &#147;I wanna be with you this weekend. With you and 
with our daughter. And you know how little time I&#146;ve got during such a 
concert.&#148; She kissed her Haruka again and felt how she slowly relaxed.

She&#146;s still frightened of me. Of my touches.

Michiru pulled her Ruka closer and the kiss became more passionately.

Who wonders...

The kiss lasted for a very long time and Haruka relaxed completely. 
Feeling her Michiru next by her side, feeling the tender touches of 
her lips let her almost forget the pain that seemed to be still in her 
belly. The words that seemed to shout still in her head. The shadow 
that seemed to hurt her again and again. Every night. In her dreams. 
In her nightmares.

Without interrupting the kiss Michiru opened the buttons of Haruka&#146;s 
pyjama. She felt how her lover froze and slowly the kiss ended while 
she started to caress the soft skin. The beautiful skin. You couldn&#146;t 
see any scars. Only if you looked closer. Really close. But there were 
hardly any scars. Even if you were able to look closer.

No external scars.

Dark green eyes looked terrified up at loving deep blue ones.

&#147;I love you, Ruka.&#148; Whispered the senshi of the wide ocean and gave 
her girlfriend another loving kiss Haruka replied hesitantly. She 
still felt the soft hands on her skin, felt those soft touches that 
felt so damn good. But at the same time so...

&#147;Don&#146;t, Michi-chan. Please... I...&#148; stammered Haruka and wanted to 
turn away, but Michiru hold her back, stared directly in her face to 
make sure that Haruka  could see that she told her the truth.

&#147;I love you, Ruka. You&#146;re the most important person in my whole life. 
I love you mentally, with all my heart.

But I also want to love you with my body.&#148; Again a short kiss then she 
looked down at her girlfriend again and felt how Haruka took a deep 
breathe.

&#147;But I am so... so... dirty now.&#148; Answered the young car racer and 
wanted to turn her head. But the understanding look in those blue eyes 
she loved so much was so hypnotising that she couldn&#146;t look away. She 
simply stared up at her lover and her body started to tremble as 
Michiru slowly stripped her pyjama. First her jacket, then the 
trouser. She didn&#146;t defend herself. All she did was to stare in those 
blue eyes. She knew she could trust her Michi-chan. Whatever happened, 
she could trust her, couldn&#146;t she?

But I slept with...

&#147;You aren&#146;t dirty, Ruka.&#148; Said Michiru and her hands caressed over her 
neck, her breasts and her slim belly.

She really did loose weights during the past weeks. And I had been so 
blind that I didn&#146;t mention...

&#147;You&#146;re the most beautiful woman I know, Ruka. There&#146;s no dirt on your 
soft skin. All I can see is goose-flesh.

Are you cold, my sweetheart?&#148; she teased but her eyes were still very 
serious. She caressed tenderly Haruka&#146;s belly and her hips. The taller 
woman laughed a shaky laugh then she closed her eyes. To enjoy the 
soft touches of her lover. To believe in her words. And to forget 
other words. Other memories. For a long time Michiru caressed Haruka&#146;s 
upper part of her body and kissed tenderly her neck. Her lover&#146;s 
breathing became faster and she could hear some oppressed groans.

&#147;Ruka, open your eyes.&#148; She whispered after a while and moved so that 
she crouched over her lover. Haruka did as she was told and thought 
that she had to drown in that beautiful blue that welcomed her. She 
felt how the caressing hands went over her belly and a little bit 
lower. She gasped and her body froze as her girlfriend touched her 
most intensive skin.

&#147;It&#146;s me, Ruka. Just think of me. I&#146;d never hurt you.&#148; Whispered 
Michiru and gave her another quick kiss while her hands kept 
caressing. &#147;You can trust me, &#145;cause I love you with all my heart.&#148; 
Haruka swallowed hard then she nodded. Slowly her body relaxed again 
under the tender touches of her lover. Then she put her head again on 
the pillow and closed her eyes. Now knowing that it was her Michi-chan 
who touched her so lovingly. She was surprised that she didn&#146;t feel 
any pain as she had expected. There was another feeling. A feeling she 
knew before that day over six weeks ago. A feeling she thought she 
would have lost at the very moment the rude man took her.

The tender touch didn&#146;t stop and the feeling built up inside her body. 
Inside her mind. She heard how her girlfriend whispered loving words. 
She felt how Michiru kissed her neck, her breasts, her belly. And 
again and again her mouth. Her lips felt so good.

So damn good!

Suddenly she heard the noises of the waves. Being pushed to the beach. 
She could feel the warm sand under her body and the fresh wind playing 
with her hairs. The sun got brighter and her body seemed to burn. But 
still there was no pain. No sorrow. No shame. All she found was love.

Understanding. Carefulness.

&#147;I love you...&#148; whispered Michiru and Haruka opened her eyes again. 
Her look was purred and she breathed hard. She didn&#146;t even mention 
that there was no beach around them. That the ocean was outside their 
house. All she saw were two deep blue eyes. They looked like the wild, 
beautiful sea. A sea she wanted to drown in. A sea she never wanted to 
leave again. A sea she wanted to cast her soul to.

Suddenly she was able to forget the rude man. About his bad words and 
his rude behaviour. Suddenly all that existed was her Michiru and that 
wonderful feeling inside her body. Time seemed to stop, no cruel world 
did exist anymore.

Haruka groaned as the feeling increased inside her body. Until she 
couldn&#146;t sustain it any longer. Until it seemed to torn her apart. 
Still there was no pain. Only joy. Joy and deep happiness. The senshi 
of the wind took another deep breathe and automatically spread her 
legs wider. She couldn&#146;t oppress a final groan.

Then she cased her soul to that sea...

&#147;I love you.&#148; Whispered Michiru again and took her still trembling 
lover in her arms and hold her tight. Haruka still gasped for breathe 
and sweat covered her beautiful body. She raised her head and now 
tears filled her dark green eyes. The first tears she was able to cry. 
Since that day over six weeks ago.

&#147;Love you, too...&#148; replied Haruka with a shaky voice. Then she pulled 
her arms around Michiru&#146;s neck, leaned her head against her shoulder 
and started desperately to cry. Her now loud sobs filled the sleeping 
room. Haruka didn&#146;t feel ashamed about her tears any longer. She knew 
that her Michi-chan loved her and that she understood her feelings. 
That she wanted to help her. To accept what happened and to live with 
it. More and more tears filled her eyes and she simply let them fall. 
Her body trembled and she clinged herself to her lover. Her only life 
line.

I love you so much, Michi-chan. With you I&#146;ll never give up. I&#146;ll 
never give up life.

Suddenly she remembered all the times she wanted to die during the 
past six weeks. Every race she raced at the limits of her race car 
seemed now dangerous and ridiculous to her. She held her Michi-chan 
tighter and felt those soft arms wrapped around her own body as well. 

Michiru swallowed hard and looked down at the wet face of her lover. 
It was the first time that she saw her that desperate. Hai, Haruka had 
cried before, but only in her presence.

When they had to sacrifice one person for the three talismans. When 
they had to kill Hotaru for the sake of the world. When they had to 
give the little senshi of death back to her real father, Dr. Tomoe.

But I have never seen her so weak before. My strong Ruka...

The smaller senshi reached for the blanket and pulled it over her 
girlfriend and herself. Then she kissed her on the forehead and 
started to caress calming Haruka&#146;s sweaty back.

It took a very long time until the senshi of the wind calmed down. The 
whole time Michiru hummed a sweet melody. A love song she once had 
written for Haruka. Only for her Ruka. To show her her deep love.

Surely it would take another very long time until Haruka would be able 
to live with the memories. To live with the incident that happened 
that day over six weeks before.

But certainly she would be able one day &#150; with the help of her 
Michi-chan.

***

It was still dawn when she awoke. The bed was empty but Haruka knew 
that Michiru was downstairs to prepare their breakfast. It was 
Saturday morning, there were no concerts, no racings and so they had 
the whole day on their own. With Hotaru. Like a real family.

&#147;My...&#148; whispered the senshi of the wind as she crept out of her 
blanket and came hard to her feet. She covered her freezing body with 
the top of her pyjama and walked slowly to the bathroom. She didn&#146;t 
look into the mirror to see her pale, sweaty face.

Breakfast. Rolls, marmalade, boiled eggs, milk...

The nausea increased inside her belly and slowly she went into her 
knees. She didn&#146;t feel that well. And she felt even worse when she 
thought of the breakfast.

&#147;My...&#148; she whispered again and opened quickly the toilette&#146;s lid.

Then she threw up the few things she ate for dinner. She choked for 
some more times and when she was sure that her stomach was really 
empty, she leaned back on the nice cool tile and closed her eyes.

It had been too much for me during the past weeks.

She sighed and wondered how she should stood up, change her clothes, 
go down in the kitchen and be a funny daddy to her daughter. But she 
knew she would. One look into Hotaru&#146;s loving child&#146;s eyes were enough 
to make her do even the craziest things.

Slowly Haruka came to her feet and left the bathroom silently.

It had been the first time that she threw up her food.

But it wasn&#146;t for the last time that weekend.
