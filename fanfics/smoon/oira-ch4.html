<h1>Oira Imei Satsu Made Shikyo (We Shall Stay Together Until Death) (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chibistar.html">Sailor Chibi Star Fighter</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/oira-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>      Usagi&#39;s eyes widened and Chibi Moon hid behind her.

      &quot;S-seiya! Please! Remember...!!&quot; Usagi whimpered, biting her 
lip.

      Seiya didn&#39;t say anything but instead rushed forward but stopped 
mid lunge as a crescent moon came to light on Usagi&#39;s forehead and a 
beam of bright golden light shot out of it and shone on her. A blue 
star appeared on Seiya&#39;s forehead and bright colorful lights exploded 
in her vision and she staggered back, holding her head in pain. Images 
were pouring into her mind.

      Walking by Usagi in an airport, the blond clinging to a young 
man&#39;s arm. The man actually resembled Seiya in a very slight way. 
Black hair, blue eyes.

      Talking to Usagi at the filming in the park after scaring her by 
sitting up on a bench.

      Usagi taking her on a tour of the school.

      Her having a fight with Yaten, Taiki, trying to calm the two 
down.

      Jumping infront of Tin Nyanko&#39;s bazooka attack, taking it for 
Sailor Moon.

      Sailor Moon helping and protecting her at the concert where she 
had fainted on stage, still recovering from the attack by Tin Nyanko.

      Her, in a starlight fuku protecting Sailor Moon.

      She and Usagi on the roof top of the school, in the rain. &quot;Am I 
not good enough...? .......Am I not good enough...?&quot;

      A woman with long red hair getting her starseed taken. She, in a 
starlight fuku again, screaming, &quot;PRINCESS!!&quot;

      A bright flash of pink light abd she in a starlight fuku once 
again. She was falling. So was Sailor Moon. She took the moon child 
into her arms and broke her fall when they hit the cold, hard, 
unforgiving concrete.

      Then, the images were gone. Seiya continued to hold her head, 
eyes wide, unblinking in shock and pain. &quot;W-what...was that?! Ugh!!&quot; 
she cried out, falling to her knees. Her eyes flickered between red 
and their original blue. &quot;Tsukino.....Usagi..Odango.... 
the....same...?&quot; she whimpered, eyes resting at blue. Then, her eyes 
rolled back and she slumped forward. Usagi gasped and slid to her 
knees, catching her.
      
      &quot;SEIYA!!&quot;

      &quot;Princess! Get back! It could be a trick!&quot; Neptune cried.

      Cordella had long sinced vanished, cursing the lowsy memory job 
that someone named &#39;Sirius&#39; had done.

      Usagi was hysterical. No matter what she did, she couldn&#39;t wake 
Seiya up.

      &quot;Seiya!! Seiya!!!!!&quot;

      The raven-haired girl&#39;s heartbeat had slowed to practically 
nothing, and her breathing was shallow and erratic.

      &quot;Seiya! Please! WAKE UP!!&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

    Cordella was arguing with a man with neck length black hair.

    &quot;Your memory job wore off already! The moon brat said something to 
her and her vampire mind went caput!&quot; she made a destructive, 
breaking, disaster-like, explosion-like motion with her hands. 
&quot;Sirius, your memory modification whatchamacallit failed miserably!&quot;

    The man, Sirius, reguarded her coldly. &quot;My Memory Modification 
Enchancer did not fail. If by some reason she were to regain her 
memories, I made sure that she would not be able to go back to her old 
life.&quot; he said the last part with a slight sneer.

    Cordella growled and grabbed the collar of his shirt and lifted 
him a few inches.  &quot;If you did anything to harm that girl I swear, I 
will kill you.&quot;

    Sirius calmly removed her hands from his collar and was once again 
standing on the floor. &quot;Growing attached to your litle pupil are we?&quot;

    Cordella narrowed her eyes. &quot;The master told us to keep her alive 
dolt.&quot;

    Sirius turned her head. &quot;Whatever you say Cordella.... Anyway, her 
memory modification, if disrupted, will bring her vital signs to a 
minimal, safe, range and she will remain comatose until one of us 
bites her again.&quot; he smirked, fangs glinting in the light.

    Cordella glared at him.

    &quot;And one other thing.&quot;

    Cordella raised an eyebrow.

    &quot;Once she is bitten again, her powers will multiply and she will 
be a vampire completely.  Her memory will not be able to be broughten 
back. Ever.&quot; he began to laugh evily.

    Cordella stared at him for a moment before her own face twisted 
into an evil, fang showing sneer, and she too began to cackle evily.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

    Usagi knelt by Seiya&#39;s bedside, holding her pale, motionless hand 
even after the others had expressed their displeasure at her remaining 
there alone.

    &quot;Seiya...onegai...wake up........&quot;

    The girl remained silent.

    Usagi brushed a few stray tears away from her eyes and forced a 
smile on her face and smoothed a lock of the girl&#39;s raven hair back 
from her eyes. &quot;No matter what Seiya......&quot; she rested her head on the 
girl&#39;s hand. &quot;.....I&#39;ll always protect and love you.......&quot; and she 
closed her eyes and soon fell asleep.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

    Cordella floated through the window of Seiya&#39;s room, silent as she 
could be. She frowned at the sight. Usagi was asleep, her heard 
resting on Seiya&#39;s hand. The vampire hovered over the bed, pondering.

    &quot;I wonder if Sirius&#39; plan will work......&quot;

    She shruged and swooped down, glancing at the blond a moment.

    &quot;The moon princess is right there, asleep. I could kill 
her....but, the master doesn&#39;t want that, so I&#39;ll just stick to the 
plan Sirius came up with.....&quot;

    She bent down and with lightning speed, bit the ravenhaired girl 
on the neck and vanished.

    Seiya&#39;s eyes flew open...but they weren&#39;t her eyes. They were 
completly red, glowing, bright and evily. Usagi stirred by the sudden 
movement. Her eyes grew wide and she stumbled back. A sphere of red 
energy exploded from Seiya, enveloping the entire apartment.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

    When Taiki came to, she was lying on the ground, covered in dust 
and ashes, coughing, she sat up. &quot;U-ugh.... WHAT THE--?!!!!!&quot; the 
apartment complex was desintigrated, nothing remained but the same 
dust and ashes that covered herself.  She clentched her fists. 
&quot;H-how..could they do that to a whole apartment building?!!&quot; Often, 
she had watched little children run around and play with each other in 
the building. &quot;A-all those..people!!&quot; her eyes widened. &quot;Oh dear 
kami-sama....&quot; she shakily rose to her feet and bolted into the 
debris. &quot;YATEN!!!&quot;

    She jumped over peices of the building and lifted the silverhaired 
girl into her arms. &quot;Yaten? Come on Yaten! Wake up!&quot;

    Yaten moaned and rubbed the back of her head. 
&quot;Itaaiiiii.......what happened?&quot;

    Taiki shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t--&quot; when she had helped the girl sit 
up her eyes had flicked upward. &quot;Oh Kami no.....please Kami no...&quot;

    Yaten blinked and looked a little worried. &quot;Whats wrong?&quot; she to 
looked up. &quot;Oh Kami....please....no... not her....not again....&quot; she 
punched her fist into the ground. &quot;SHIMATTA!!! WHY CAN&#39;T THEY LEAVE 
HER ALONE?!?!?!!!&quot;


    The ravenhaired Kou Seiya, lead singer of the Three Lights, Sailor 
Star Fighter, leader of the Sailor Starlights, was floating above 
where the apartment had been, glowing red, her eyes glowing the same 
evil shade, an evil, twisted sneer on her face.
