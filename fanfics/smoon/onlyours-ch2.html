<p>Rei had imagined Minako lots of places.</p>
<p>She had imagined her  in a white dress by the ocean at night, her feet covered in sand like a  sugar doughnut. She had imagined her flush and breathless beneath Rei,  little splotches of pink crawling up her naked chest and neck. She had  imagined her in the dark, her pale skin like a shallow dish of milk  that Rei would lap up with her tongue.</p>
<p>She had not imagined her here, in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Standing before her awkwardly.</p>
<p>Rei  was on folded knees in the fire room, organizing a pile of wood into  neat stacks up against the wall. The pieces interlocked together,  balancing up against the screens, the rest of the room void of anything  but the square opening where Rei would consult the fire and a small  pillow where she would sit. And Minako had come here, far too early for  someone with a hangover, in a blue cotton dress.</p>
<p>Rei could barely look at her.</p>
<p>The  miko hadn't slept, but she never did. She kept herself busy all night  with chores and anger—mainly anger. And with the stark daylight she was  able to see clearly what had happened the other night. There was no  question in Rei's mind now, with the chimes of the shrine ringing in  the background, with the patter of conversations floating in from down  the street. Rei would erase every last minute of that night whether  Minako wanted it or not.</p>
<p>What a fool Minako was, to think she could come and seduce Rei here, in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>The  blond stood by the door, fingering the soft, yellow paper there. She  remembered what had happened in bits and pieces. She remembered Rei's  stomach rising and falling faster and faster the closer Minako got to  her. She remembered Rei's finger in her mouth. She remembered Rei  saying, &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>And now she was here, forcing Rei to relive every last excruciating minute of it.</p>
<p>The miko kept herself busy with the firewood.</p>
<p>“Busy  day at the shrine today?” Minako asked, trying desperately to think of  something she could say. Her head was pounding and she wanted to reach  out to Rei and never let go of her. She wanted to hit and scream at Rei  for ignoring her. She wanted to suck on her finger again. She didn’t  know what she wanted.</p>
<p>“Mmm,” the priestess replied, which wasn’t even a reply at all.</p>
<p>“Did  you have fun at the festival last night?” the blond continued, daring a  glance towards Rei and then quickly adverting her eyes when she saw the  miko staring at her.</p>
<p>“Minako—stop.”</p>
<p>She fell silent and  dropped her hand from the screen, looking anywhere but Rei’s face. How  could she do this? How could she act so nonchalant like nothing had  happened between them when clearly something had? Something wonderful.  Something dangerous. Something pleading. Something.</p>
<p>&quot;What did it  mean?&quot; Minako said suddenly, looking to Rei. She was finally brave  enough to meet the miko head on, or maybe it was the anger, the  pleading, the pounding in her head and nothing like bravery at all.</p>
<p>Rei  stiffened, darting her gaze quickly to Minako. Her eyes were glittering  darkly, daring anyone to bypass them, to forge ahead with the warning  buried there. Then she turned back to the wood, taking another piece  and placing it gently on top of the others. When Rei spoke, it was  carefully, with just the right air of even certainty. &quot;What are you  talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>Minako hated her. She hated her. She hated her.</p>
<p>It  was easy to be angry with Rei. It was so easy when Minako had actually  taken the time this morning to pick out a cotton dress to wear with the  intent of enticing her friend. So easy when this wasn't the first time  Rei had tried to erase their history. So easy when every time Minako  was bold enough to act on an impulse, the priestess hid away behind an  unemotional, unresponsive exterior that could so easily break her best  friend. How could she do that?</p>
<p>&quot;I'm talking about last night,&quot;  Minako said bluntly, her eyes flashing with hurt and betrayal. &quot;Or was  it someone else I was with and not you?&quot;</p>
<p>Inwardly Rei snarled at  the blond who dared to enter her shrine so casually, dressed like a  goddamn sex pot and dared to bring up something like that... like  THAT... here. In the middle of the day. Outwardly, Rei shrugged,  looking away towards the corner of the room. &quot;I wasn't myself. I didn't  mean to give you any ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any ideas?&quot; Minako's voice had risen.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>She  could have punched Rei in the face. So visible was Minako's anger that  she began pacing, clutching the bottom of her dress into fists, giving  Rei a startling view of her best friends legs. Rei immediately turned  her eyes away from those tempting limbs, focusing, instead, on the task  at hand. Minako tried to say something. She tried twice before stopping  herself, clamping her mouth shut with a snap. The words were there, but  they were in a furry, tangled mess in her mind, tumbling along the  inside of her skull trying to carve out the perfect assault that could  hurt Rei as much as she had hurt her. But Minako wasn't as good at  arranging words as Rei was. Her arguments would flail in comparison to  the composed stoic priestess, who could go on stacking firewood as if  that was the only goddamn thing that mattered in the room.</p>
<p>All that seemed to come out of Minako's mouth was one harsh word flung haphazardly, meaninglessly, in Rei's direction.</p>
<p>&quot;Bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>Rei  tilted an eyebrow at Minako in surprise, but by then she had already  swirled around and slammed the screen door shut with a definitely  smack. Rei noticed that a small tear had opened in the corner of her  screen that Minako had been worrying with her fingers. The priestess  stood and tried to smooth the soft, yellow paper. It didn't help. The  damage had already been done.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rei didn't know why she did this. There was something about Minako's room, and more specifically, her bed.</p>
<p>She  had spent many nights next to Minako, over the course of high school  and even into college when the girls would get together for a  sleepover. Back then, she didn't think too much about what made her  crawl over into Minako's bed at night, or what it meant when they woke  up together—tangled and comfortable and warm. There was no alternative  motive then, in the hazy impulses of adolescence, where their close  friendship allowed those kinds of intimacies without question. But now  they were older. Minako had let many people into her bed, and not for  the same reasons as before. Her bed was no longer something to share  between friends but rather, a haven for lovers.</p>
<p>Rei knew if she ever did enter into Minako's bed as an adult it would be different.</p>
<p>It would be more.</p>
<p>Minako  was asleep. Of course she was, it was nearly four a.m. and most normal  people found sleep an essential part of life. Rei did not. Sleeping had  always been an afterthought, thrown in after her mental and physical  exhaustion became too much for her body to cope. And now Rei couldn't  coax her body into slumber even if she had wanted to. It started this  summer, when Minako came back from college for a while, living in that  apartment just down the street from the shrine. And Rei could never  rest soundly knowing that.</p>
<p>But here she was.</p>
<p>Standing in front of Minako's bed.</p>
<p>Miserable.</p>
<p>And that same feeling that graced her at night was there too, making her gnaw worriedly at her bottom lip.</p>
<p>Rei  carefully took a step forward and tested what it would feel like to sit  on the edge of her best friend’s mattress. It sunk with her weight and  so she quickly flattened herself out on her back, willing the mattress  to remain undisturbed by her presence. She could feel Minako breathing  next to her, and Rei was frozen in terror at what she had started. She  should get up and leave immediately, she knew this, but every fiber in  her was instead telling her to reach out and stroke Minako's long  golden hair. She hated when Minako was mad at her. It was so much  easier when she was the one holding the grudge, feeling righteous and  fiery in her own right. She was good at being angry. But after two days  of no communication, she couldn't stop herself from going and finding  Minako. She was unhappy and lonely without her best friend.</p>
<p>Oh  god. Her delicious, dangerous scent was everywhere. Minako's warm skin  was radiating with it, the orange groves, the summer air... Rei had  unnatural urges to start licking her sweet, sticky skin because of it.  And consequently Rei was reminded of the cherry blossom tree, since  Minako had invaded that secret spot too with the same infuriating  scent. Intoxicating. Beautiful. Good enough to eat.</p>
<p>Minako  shifted, and Rei snapped alert, forcing her mind not to wander. She  became aware of every inch of Minako's body along hers as she inhaled  shallowly and let out narrow breaths of air. Minako was only wearing a  small shirt and underwear and Rei was acutely focused on the blond  vixen’s legs, bare and soft pressing up against her side. The miko felt  herself reaching out, as if someone other person had control of her  limbs, and drawing Minako close to her, so she could get buried into  that unusual blond hair. Minako didn't seem to wake, instead turning so  she was nuzzled along Rei's front. Then lazily, Minako hooked her leg  around her best friend and Rei felt like groaning. It was too good. Too  much.</p>
<p>Hadn't they slept together like this so many times before?</p>
<p>But  with Rei's secret intentions, with the awareness of Minako's soft, warm  body, with the blond nuzzling her face into Rei and Rei letting  her—no—welcoming her...It had never been anything like this before when  they were teenagers. Nothing like <em>this.</em></p>
<p>It was more.</p>
<p>Maybe  all the things Rei wanted back then when they were young were the same  now. Maybe the only difference now was how badly she wanted it. Maybe  after seeing Minako golden in the dim light of their cherry blossom  tree, licking her lips and pleading Rei's name was all it took to break  the strong priestess.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Rei whispered into Minako's  hair. It was easy to say when Minako was sleeping, wasn't it? And Rei  wanted to say more, she wanted to confess things she had never said out  loud before, but she didn't have the words.</p>
<p>Minako could not tell  reality from dream-state, since she was still entrapped by the  aloofness of slumber, but it didn't matter. This dream was nice, even  if it wasn't a dream at all. There was a dark crater of longing that  was sitting in between Minako's legs, and the moment she had discovered  Rei in her bed, she stopped caring about everything else. She didn’t  care that she was supposed to be mad with the priestess, shunning her  for daring to ignore her in a blue cotton dress. And even if Rei would  erase this all in the morning, even if it really was all a dream she  could only relive in her mind, she didn't care, didn't care, didn't  care...</p>
<p>With delicate fingers, she slid the bottom of Rei's shirt  up over her stomach and Rei surprisingly let her lift it from her  shoulders. It rolled up along Rei's arms, leaving her naked chest  pressed right up along Minako's soft and supple curves, and for one  horrifying moment Rei thought her friend would open her eyes, disrupt  this guise of sleep and see Rei there, bare, wanting, needing... but  then Minako was back, her mouth pressed up in the hallow of Rei's neck.</p>
<p>Rei  could continue pretending as long as Minako continued to sleep, even if  the blond’s hands were now running along Rei's back, hooked just-so in  the smallest part of her ribs. Rei could pretend they didn't know what  they had been doing. <em>You were asleep, </em>she could say. And as long as Minako was asleep, she could be brave.</p>
<p>Rei  pressed the front of her pelvis directly up against Minako, squaring  them together like a living, breathing yin yang. Minako responded by  tightening her legs around their existing tangle, the sheets long ago  twisted around their ankles. There was some sort of hot desire that was  awakened as Rei pressed herself along Minako, and she moved her hips  slightly in experimentation. The woman beside her accommodated the  movement by shifting with her.</p>
<p>Minako felt soft. She felt like  Rei had imagined her. And the aching, the demand, the desire that Rei  normally shoved away was there, feeding into her movements, making her  forget what exactly she was doing. She would have let Minako touch her  anywhere as long as she kept pretending to sleep, as long as Rei didn't  have to confront this in the morning.</p>
<p>But then, quite suddenly, she felt Minako's eyelashes flutter open against her neck.</p>
<p>Rei  stiffened and Minako knew of her mistake too late. For one moment they  remained tangled up in each other but then Rei sat upright, and Minako  followed her, so they both sat side by side. The modest miko pulled the  sheets up from their ankles to hide her naked chest and then began  instantly hunting for her lost shirt, which had been tossed behind her  back on Minako's floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Rei…&quot; Minako started but Rei interrupted her.</p>
<p>&quot;Just stop.&quot;</p>
<p>She  hastily grabbed her shirt and yanked it over her head before falling  still in her movements, embarrassed, ashamed, red with the anger and  the humiliation of acting like this with her best friend. Why was she  here? Why did she crawl into Minako's bed? Why had Minako let her? It  didn't seem to make sense to the priestess now that the pretending was  gone.</p>
<p>Minako hated Rei for reacting like this. The miko was the  one who had crawled into her bed, not the other way around. It was  Rei's fault for being here, but through her best friend's silence and  stiff posture, Minako was left feeling like the guilty one. She grabbed  Rei’s hand and for a moment the priestess let her hold it, but then she  pulled it away.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't erase this,&quot; Minako said quietly, hoping that it would be true.</p>
<p>Rei  didn't speak. She wanted to say she was sorry. She wanted to confess  things, but her throat wasn’t working. Her heart wasn’t working.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  something. You can't just keep on telling me it's nothing. That is what  you would say, isn't it?&quot; Minako whispered, her voice cracking in the  still darkness around them.</p>
<p>Rei turned, and put both of her feet  flat on the floor. Minako cursed under her breath. Rei's pulse was  quick in her ears and still her breathing was labored and shallow, like  she had just gone running a few miles. She felt the hot throbbing  desire in the depths of her belly and she knew she could not lie about  this only seconds after it had all happened to the two of them. Minako  reached out and slid her arm around Rei’s waist and Rei let herself  lean back, closing her eyes and indulging in the delicious smell, the  comfort, the familiarity of their friendship—their—relationship?</p>
<p>Rei was tired. She was always tired.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not nothing,&quot; the priestess confessed simply.</p>
<p><em>It was more.</em></p>
