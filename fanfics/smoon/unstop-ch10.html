<hr />
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you.”</p>
<p>“Hunh?”</p>
<p>“There’s  cruel, and then there’s cruel, and you have crossed the line! In fact,  you are so far across the line that if you waved, the line wouldn’t  even see you! It would need binoculars! It would need binoculars and  satellite imaging! It would –”</p>
<p>“Minako?”</p>
<p>“Who else?!”</p>
<p>“What are you –?”</p>
<p>“You’ve sicked my own mother on me!”</p>
<p>“Oh. Hmm, yes I suppose I have.”</p>
<p>“You quit sounding so smug right now, you wretched excuse for a friend!”</p>
<p>“Now, now –”</p>
<p>“Don’t ‘now, now’ me!”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on –”</p>
<p>“Do not ‘oh come on’ me! You suck!”</p>
<p>“Well then, have fun being chaperoned by your mom.”</p>
<p>“I hate you.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be some good ol’ fashioned mother-daughter time.”</p>
<p>“Hate you.”</p>
<p>“No  you don’t. You just hate losing, and I’ve obviously won because there’s  nothing worse you can do to me without inflicting permanent physical  damage.”</p>
<p>“Which is not out of the question.”</p>
<p>“But it is, because then I couldn’t drive you to school and you couldn’t sleep in in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Damn you and your blackmail.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Truce?”</p>
<p>“Ha! . . . I’ll think about it . . .”</p>
<p>“Take your time. Good luck, by the way.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Oh yeah! Yay! Thanks. We’re totally gonna win.”</p>
<p>“So I’ll see you Friday morning, then?”</p>
<p>“Mmhmm. Miss me already?”</p>
<p>“You haven’t even left yet.”</p>
<p>“But I will soon, and the mere thought of it makes your heart ache. You’ll probably spend all day sobbing into your pillow.”</p>
<p>“Well, I might have a little indigestion from the fish last night. Could we call that heartache?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take what I can get!”</p>
<p>“Haha, see you Friday.”</p>
<p>“Bye, Rei!”</p>
<p>“Bye, Minako.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“Hey, Hino,” Rei heard from behind her.</p>
<p>She  turned to see Ichiro leaning against the wall next to the door she had  just exited. “Hi,” Rei replied curtly, deciding to forego asking why  the boy was lurking outside the girl’s change room.</p>
<p>The younger  student caught up to her and fell in step, making it plain that he’d  been waiting for her. “So, pretty boring practice today, huh?”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “I find repetition relaxing.”</p>
<p>“Oh, er, cool. You seem like a very relaxed person.”</p>
<p>If  Ichiro had been looking at Rei and not at his shoes, he would have seen  Rei’s brow twitch at his unsolicited opinion of her character. She  decided that nothing was probably the kindest thing she had to say in  reply to that.</p>
<p>“Um, have you got any plans for this Friday?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>They approached the doors that led to the parking lot and Ichiro scurried ahead of her to hold the door.</p>
<p>“Thank  you,” Rei said as she walked past him, slightly bemused by his strange  behaviour. “Did you drive as well?” she asked, though she knew a tenth  grader couldn’t have a license yet.</p>
<p>“No, but I wanted to ask you  . . . um . . .” Ichiro stopped walking and Rei grudgingly paused,  waiting for him to spit out whatever it was that was making him so  nervous. “Do you have a boyfriend?”</p>
<p>Rei frowned, suddenly  catching on to where this was going. Her mind raced but she couldn’t  think of a good way to avoid the awkwardness that was about to come.  “No, I don’t . . .”</p>
<p>Ichiro seemed to consider something for a moment, and then tentatively asked, “Do you have . . . a - a girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“No. Is that all? I have to get going.” Rei turned to flee.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Ichiro shouted, desperation colouring his voice.</p>
<p>Rei closed her eyes, sighed, and turned back to see her fellow archer looking just as distressed as he sounded.</p>
<p>“Will you go out with me?” he finally blurted.</p>
<p>The  miko took a moment to consider how best to soften the blow, but had no  experience with these sorts of situations and simply replied, “No.”</p>
<p>Ichiro  looked painfully disappointed at that and Rei froze, sympathetic but  unsure of how to convey it without hurting the boy more or, worse,  giving him hope.</p>
<p>“Why not?” he asked quietly.</p>
<p>“Ah, well,  I’m just . . . not interested. Sorry.” Rei scuffed her foot against the  ground awkwardly, her hand fiddling with her car keys in her pocket.</p>
<p>Ichiro stared miserably at the ground. “Okay . . .”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” she repeated. “Um, I’ll see you at practice tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess so.”</p>
<p>Out  of things to say, Rei retreated to her car. Buckled in, keys in the  ignition, she sat for a moment, going over what had just happened. With  a bewildered chuckle and a sigh, she scratched the back of her head and  started the car.</p>
<hr />
<p>Minako was pretending to sleep. With her  earphones in, eyes closed and body limp, she would say she was pulling  it off fairly well.</p>
<p>It was a couple hours’ drive to get to the  city the national volleyball competition were being held in, and while  Minako might normally have spent the time goofing around with her team  mates, this time she wasn’t even going to open her eyes until they got  there. The coach had threatened to double the laps of the gym for the  first person to get noisy and her mother was sitting up front with the  other chaperones – by Minako’s calculation, these were two very good  reasons to just keep her head down.</p>
<p>Cowed into silence with only  her music for entertainment left Minako no option but to daydream about  Rei. The miko wasn’t what Minako would have chosen to contemplate – way  too much of her time was already taken up by just that, but she  couldn’t muster the willpower to think of something else. All her  willpower had been directed for the past few weeks at not jumping Rei’s  bones. Even when she’d crash-landed on top of the other girl, Minako  had managed to rein herself in and force herself off.</p>
<p>Now there  was a memory worth dwelling on – Rei looking up at her wide-eyed, lips  parted vulnerably as if awaiting a kiss, her body stretched beneath  Minako’s in the most inviting way . . . Of course, Rei hadn’t been  awaiting a kiss; she’d been winded, and their bodies hadn’t been  stretched against each other invitingly so much as tangled awkwardly  but bah! Details.</p>
<p>Minako felt a finger poke her cheek and cracked  open her eyes to see Kagura smirking at her. Her friend plucked one of  her earphones out of her ear and explained, “Pretending to sleep  doesn’t work very well when you’ve got a huge grin on your face.”</p>
<p>Immediately trying to school her features, Minako shrugged. “Whatever. I wasn’t sleepy anyway.”</p>
<p>She  resettled herself so that her head was propped up and she could stare  out the window. Kagura returned to reading her book and Minako watched  the road rush behind them, staring idly at the scenery and shifting her  contemplations to her newfound love of driving. Or rather, sitting in a  car being driven, as Minako didn’t have her license and didn’t really  see the point in getting one.</p>
<p>Rei drove like she drew calligraphy  – efficiently and gracefully following the exact procedures required,  her focus all calmly directed toward manoeuvring her car smoothly. This  focus meant that Minako could get away with watching Rei so long as she  wasn’t too obvious about it – an ability that had led to many a  daydream creeping up while she studied the miko’s perfect profile and  ambushing her with thoughts of backseats and frantic before-class  activities and foggy windows. . . And then Minako would stare too long,  Rei would eventually look over, and Minako would scramble to talk about  something as if that was why she’d been looking over all along.  Whatever Rei thought of her friend’s blush and skittish eye-contact she  kept to herself.</p>
<p>Minako frowned. Rei kept other things to herself  as well. When she’d told the miko about Erika’s crush on her, Rei had  been shocked and then looked reserved and pensive for the rest of the  drive to school. When she’d asked Rei what she thought of it, all  Minako had received was evasion.</p>
<p>It proved nothing, of course,  but Minako couldn’t help but feel her jaw clench at the idea that Rei’s  silence might have been born out of some actual feeling for Erika. No  matter how many times she reassured herself that there was nothing to  worry about, jealousy continued to eat at her, so she resorted to  trying not to think about it.</p>
<p>Instead, she had a myriad of other,  more pleasing memories to consider . . . Like that one morning where  they had skipped their first classes to stay in the car together and .  . . work on Minako’s homework. Okay, so it wasn’t all that exciting,  but there had been a moment where Rei had killed the car engine,  unbuckled her seatbelt and turned to Minako in just the manner she did  before ravishing the blonde in most of her car fantasies. A tantalising  memory, but not as satisfying as some.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s hug goodbye  had been satisfying in its own way, mostly because Rei was the one who  had started it. The miko had dropped her off at home, only to get out  of the car as well so they could “say goodbye properly,” the dark  haired girl had explained, simulating nonchalance, and then reached out  and enveloped Minako in a hug.</p>
<p>It was all the little, perfect  details that made the embrace worth revisiting – the soft tickle of  Rei’s hair brushing her cheek, warmth radiating between them, the  breath from Rei’s nose against her neck, a heady rush of desire and  affection. She and Rei were about the same height, but Minako had bent  a little to press her face to the other girl’s shoulder. With her lips,  she could feel the heat of the skin concealed by a thin layer of  cotton, tempting her from beneath Rei’s clothes.</p>
<p>Minako’s eyes  had closed without her even noticing and only opened when Rei was the  one who finally withdrew, realising perhaps that they’d overrun the  time limit of a normal hug by quite a margin.</p>
<p>Staring out the bus  window, the blonde smiled softly. She was pumped for nationals, but she  couldn’t wait to return home, to a place where she could walk down the  stairs in the morning and find Rei waiting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tuesday morning  Rei went straight to school from her house and arrived forty-five  minutes early because she hadn’t had to wait around for Minako. She  sighed, pulled out a book to read, and resolved to leave later tomorrow.</p>
<p>After  school, she chucked her bag in the back, started up her car and slid  into the line of cars leaving the parking lot. She drummed her fingers  on the steering wheel, wiped a speck of dust off of the dashboard and  realised how much empty space there was inside her car. Glancing at the  vacant passenger seat, Rei sighed and flipped the radio on for the rest  of the drive.</p>
<p>While sweeping the shrine she started whistling  some repetitive, annoyingly chipper pop song and had to stop herself  three times without ever having realised she had started up again in  the first place. After the third time, she forced herself to think  instead of the stroke-order for all of the most complex kanji she could  call to mind.</p>
<p>That evening Grandpa sent her strange looks throughout dinner until Rei barked, “What?”</p>
<p>He looked down. “You’re shaking the table.”</p>
<p>She  looked down. Her left leg was bouncing against the leg of the table and  Rei realised her dishes were rattling. She stopped and scowled.</p>
<p>“When does Minako get home?” he enquired.</p>
<p>“Depends,”  Rei sighed. “They have four games to play if they’re going to win  nationals, but if they lose at any point, they’re sent home. They could  be back as early as tonight or as late as Thursday.” Rei brooded into  her soup for a half-second before looking up quizzically. “Why?”</p>
<p>The elder Hino sighed and shook his head. “No reason.”</p>
<p>After  dinner, studying proved to serve as yet another bothersome reminder of  Minako’s absence. It had been months since they had even studied  together, and Rei frowned to herself in frustration, irked by her  inability to keep the blonde from surfacing in her thoughts for any  reasonable amount of time. Taped off and untouched, Ainoland seemed to  taunt her with its presence, a glaring reminder in the corner of her  own bedroom.</p>
<p>She sighed. Minako was sending her some decidedly  mixed signals and they were going to have to talk about it before Rei  grew completely confused. The blonde was happy to spend every morning  chatting and staring at her in the car, but then she would hint at  Erika as if Rei ought to be thinking about her. Minako claimed she had  missed Rei during the months they hadn’t seen each other, but she had  spent the time dating various other people.</p>
<p>Frowning, Rei  dismissed her thoughts before they fed her insecurities further. She  couldn’t understand the blonde’s actions, but she wasn’t going to  speculate needlessly and perhaps reach the wrong conclusion when she  could wait and hear the truth from Minako herself. And Rei did intend  to hear it – the truth between them was a long time coming.</p>
<hr />
<p>“You  seem tense,” Rei remarked to Minako as the two of them, fresh from  another round of Mrs. Aino’s teasing, got settled in her car.</p>
<p>Minako put her seatbelt on and cocked her head slightly at Rei. “Do I?”</p>
<p>Rei glanced over at the blonde before turning the car on and putting it in gear. “A little.”</p>
<p>“Well,  I guess I’ve been thinking about nationals a lot. I’m nervous about  it.” She pulled down the sun visor and took a couple seconds to check  her reflection in the lighted mirror.</p>
<p>“Do you think you guys can win?” Rei asked curiously.</p>
<p>The  blonde grinned and bounced in her seat a bit. “I do! That’s what makes  me nervous. If we were outmatched, we could just play for fun, but  playing to win is harder.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” Rei murmured in agreement.</p>
<p>“What about you guys?” Minako asked. “Archery must finish with some kind of tournament, right?”</p>
<p>Rei  frowned at a car in front of her that squeezed into her lane without  signalling. Bastard. “Um, yeah at the end of the year there’s a  competition. People are already bugging me about it.”</p>
<p>“Bugging you?” Minako chuckled and teased, “I thought you had them too scared to bother you.”</p>
<p>This  time, Rei’s irritated frown was directed her way. “I did! And then you  had to go and tell them I pulled the fire alarm. For some stupid reason  they seem to think I’m approachable now.”</p>
<p>Minako laughed, pleased with herself. Rei ignored her.</p>
<p>“I bet Erika doesn’t bother you,” she said casually.</p>
<p>Rei snorted. “She’s the worst.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“She’s  always saying how I’m gonna win the competition for sure.” Slightly  self-conscious about revealing this, lest it sound like bragging, Rei  huffed, “It’s now like she even knows who I’ll be competing against and  I’m probably not even the best on the team.”</p>
<p>“She’s saying it because she likes you,” Minako informed her.</p>
<p>Aware that the blonde was watching her reaction, Rei tried to clarify, “She . . . you mean, like . . .”</p>
<p>With a smirk, Minako asked, “You mean you didn’t notice?”</p>
<p>Rei  resumed scowling. Of course she didn’t notice. She didn’t care. Why was  she being told this? Did Minako really have so little interest in her  anymore that she would try and set her up with other girls? She was  aware that she was being too quiet but, mired in confusion, a litany of  unhappy emotions and her own awkwardness, Rei couldn’t come up with  anything to say.</p>
<p>Maybe Minako was telling her this to try and  gauge her feelings? Rei had no idea. The calculating way the blonde was  acting was too new and unsettling. She was supposed to be throwing out  careless remarks, giggling over strange things and pestering Rei just  to get a reaction, not looking at her with that removed expression.</p>
<p>“Do you like her?” Minako asked.</p>
<p>Was  she supposed to? The answer was no, but if Minako asked why, the answer  would be her, and that wasn’t an answer she was prepared to give just  out of the blue. Trying not to fidget or look as lost as she felt, Rei  shot back, “Why? Do <em>you</em> like her?”</p>
<p>“No. Do you?”</p>
<p>“What a ridiculous question.”</p>
<p>“One  you’re not answering. Suspicious . . .” Though her tone was playful,  when Rei looked over those blue eyes still had that watchful edge which  made her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Whatever,” she muttered and drove quietly the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Minako just stared out the window and Rei was consumed by her thoughts. <em>This isn’t how it should be</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>“<em>You’re  so hot. God, I want you . . .” She deftly unzipped the fly on Rei’s  blue jeans, sliding them down slender, pale legs. “So much . . .” The  streetlights outside cast a slender beam of light through the gap in  the curtains leaving much of the room in darkness, showing her only  tantalising glimpses of the miko’s body. What she could see was  mouth-watering and what she could feel even more so. Smooth, warm and  sensitive.</em></p>
<p><em>So sensitive down there when Minako dipped a  finger to feel that hot, silken flesh she bucked and gasped, though her  eyes still watched hers with that barely veiled uncertainty. So  sensitive their stare was broken all too soon as dark eyes rolled back  in her head and her lids fluttered closed, brow furrowed, bottom lip  trapped between her teeth . . .</em></p>
<p>Her phone rang sharply and  Minako was rudely jerked awake. She groped the dresser for her  cellphone, grumbling and nearly flipping herself onto the floor before  finally securing the ringing device and snapping it open.</p>
<p>“Hrmmph.” Her eyes blearily read 7:16 on the clock.</p>
<p>Rei laughed on the other end. “<em>Oh good, I was hoping you’d still be asleep when I called</em>.”</p>
<p>At  the sound of her voice, Minako sat up and scooted until she was propped  up by her pillows and the headboard. The hotel room was still dark but  Minako could faintly see the outline of Kagura’s unmoving form in the  bed next to hers. “You’re evil,” she muttered.</p>
<p>This prompted more  chuckling and Minako smiled. Her heart was still beating rather fast  from being surprised into wakefulness and from the dream she’d been  torn out of. She rubbed her legs together, trying to ignore how hot she  felt and the accompanying feeling of guilt the memory of that night  brought with it.</p>
<p>“<em>So you guys got there alright</em>?” Rei asked.</p>
<p>“Mmhmm. It was a pretty boring drive.”</p>
<p>“<em>Better boring than eventful when it comes to driving, I think</em>.”</p>
<p>“Huh,  not a chance,” Minako disagreed. “Give me icy roads! Two billion car  pile-ups!” She heard Rei scoff into the phone and mutter some  despairing comment. “And did you call just to check on me? You’re so  sweeeeet,” she cooed.</p>
<p>A huff of breath made the connection crackle a little and Minako grinned, imagining Rei’s eyes rolling. “<em>And to wake you up. You have practice at eight and I know you skip breakfast sometimes</em>.”</p>
<p>“Okay, mother,” Minako sulked, though she was reluctantly pleased at Rei’s attention.</p>
<p>“<em>Yeah, yeah. Just sparing you the lecture from your actual mother</em>.”</p>
<p>“Oh, now you’ve decided to spare me?” she asked wryly. “Thanks.”</p>
<p>She could practically hear Rei’s smirk. “<em>Anytime. But I’ve gotta go soon. I haven’t swept the steps yet and it snowed a little last night</em>.”</p>
<p>“Drive carefully.”</p>
<p>“<em>Changed your mind about the pile-up</em>?” Rei chuckled. “<em>I will. How you feeling about your first game? Still nervous?</em>”</p>
<p>Minako  picked idly at the bed quilt and watched Kagura for signs of  wakefulness. “A little. Mostly excited though – I can’t wait to play.”</p>
<p>“<em>Good. You love volleyball. You’ll have a lot of fun</em>,” Rei said comfortingly.</p>
<p>“I know. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“<em>Just don’t stare at girls in the stands and you’ll crush the other team</em>,” she teased.</p>
<p>Minako laughed, smiling widely at the memory. “Well, you’re not here so it shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
<p>“<em>Good</em>,” Rei replied simply and Minako pondered the double-meaning of her reply. “<em>And good luck</em>!”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“<em>Bye. Talk to you tomorrow</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ll call after dinner. Bye, Rei.”</p>
<p>She  closed her phone and basked for a few seconds in fuzzy, warm feelings.  Then she slid out of bed, clutching a pillow. “And you,” she said to  Kagura, “quit pretending you’re asleep!” Swinging the pillow in a wide  arc, she walloped her friend over the head.</p>
<p>Kagura grumbled and cursed Minako while the blonde skipped away gleefully to use the bathroom first.</p>
<hr />
<p>“What’s  that?” Rei asked, referring to the papers and binder that Minako had  whipped out of her backpack the second they’d entered the car.</p>
<p>While  Rei drove, Minako explained, “It’s a poem for my literature class.  Damn. Who knew there was so much crap to decipher in each little  chunky?”</p>
<p>“Stanza.”</p>
<p>“Eh?” Minako paused her scowling perusal of the poem.</p>
<p>“I think you meant stanza,” Rei repeated dryly.</p>
<p>“Whatever.” She returned to her homework, now jotting down the rhyme scheme.</p>
<p>“Do  you need to hand something in on it? I can’t imagine you’d be working  on it otherwise . . .” Rei jabbed, glancing over to see the blonde  scowl and pout.</p>
<p>“Oh, ha ha . . . yes. I have a presentation to do  on it for second period,” Minako admitted and then grinned guiltily.  “I’m gonna have to skip first period to put it together.”</p>
<p>Looking over in some alarm, Rei asked, “And are you just starting now?”</p>
<p>She watched the blonde cough and hum, not making eye contact at all.</p>
<p>“You’re boned.”</p>
<p>Minako  laughed in surprise at the crude colloquialism from Rei, but sighed and  agreed, “Up the ass.” She returned to working, but not before watching  the other girl cringe and make a face at her all-too-explicit reply.</p>
<p>“You’re never going to get that finished in time,” the miko said, partly to herself. “I guess I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>“Eh?” The blonde looked back up at that.</p>
<p>Rei  sped the rest of the way to school and nearly mowed down several  students hanging around in the parking lot. Upon parking, she undid her  seatbelt and snatched the poem from Minako, who was staring rather  dazedly at the dark haired girl.</p>
<p>Swiftly reading and rereading  the poem bit by bit, Rei began to draw out the main ideas of the poem  and its overall tone and mood. She plucked the pencil out of Minako’s  hand and started to write down notes, drawing arrows and underlining  passages.</p>
<p>Minako finally blinked and realised, “You’re going to skip and help me with my homework?”</p>
<p>Rei  snorted. “Do you want to fail your presentation? Poems take time and  effort to understand – it’ll show if you miss the main points and  techniques.”</p>
<p>Silence followed while Rei concentrated. Literature  was her favourite subject and to her it followed naturally that she  could analyse poetry without too much difficulty. Carefully constructed  with thought and attention put into the details, poems were like a  puzzle with layers of meaning to unearth through analysis. Just as she  was contemplating a particularly abrupt enjambment, she heard Minako  sigh and looked up.</p>
<p>“You’re still so . . .”</p>
<p>There was a strange expression on the blonde’s face – not happy, but not quite sad. Confused. Conflicted.</p>
<p>Rei  waited for Minako to finish her sentence, unable to look away from the  blue eyes that held hers just as steadily. What was it in her  expression? In her voice? Rei wasn’t good at this. For all that she  could unravel the nuances of a poetic text, understanding emotions and  other people was an art nearly lost upon the solitary miko.</p>
<p>“Minako,” she started to say, and what was to come after, she didn’t know.</p>
<p>The  passenger side door was opened and Minako cleared her throat. “We  should go work in the library. Someone will probably pass by and think  we’re hotboxing your car or something.”</p>
<p>“Oh . . . Okay,” Rei  accepted, straightening the papers together and getting out of the car  as well. She grabbed her bag out of the back just as Minako did and as  the two of them walked together toward the school, Rei asked  tentatively, “You’re okay with me helping you with your homework,  right?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Minako grinned, which Rei suspected was a  bit forced. “I’m crap at poems. If you thought I was hopeless at math,  just wait until you see me in literature.”</p>
<p>Rei rolled her eyes –  something she hadn’t had the pleasure of doing since they had last  collaborated on school work. In some ways, Minako might never change,  but Rei was still not convinced at the blonde’s sudden change of mood.  It wasn’t until Minako smiled softly and thanked her for helping that  Rei felt at ease again, pacified by the genuine happiness that sparkled  in those blue eyes.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Hey, Hino,” Rei heard from behind her.</p>
<p>She spun, pressing the shirt she had just taken off to her chest. <em>This</em> was why changing in public was so damn awkward. Why did people think she wanted to talk when she was half naked?</p>
<p>Erika  was already changed into her archery clothes and looking up at Rei  expectantly. She was short, Rei realised. One would probably call her  petite.</p>
<p>“Uh . . . hi,” she replied and turned back toward her  locker, hoping this would be enough of a hint to discourage further  conversation.</p>
<p>There was a pause, during which Rei dared to hope, and then Erika hesitantly began, “I um, I was wondering if uh, if-”</p>
<p>“Could we . . . do this when I’m dressed?” Rei interrupted, dropping her hands to her hips.</p>
<p>Erika’s  eyes jumped to her pale purple bra and then the shorter girl blushed  and stammered while looking away, “Ah r-right! Yeah sorry sure yeah I .  . . I uh, I’ll talk to you out there.” Erika marched off to the exit  toward the archery range without further stutters.</p>
<p>Realising she  had exposed herself more than she’d intended to, Rei blushed a little  herself and quickly tugged her gym t-shirt on. Well, now she knew  Minako had been right when she’d brought up Erika’s crush, not that it  helped Rei at all. This was going to be Ichiro all over again. The  younger boy was still shooting her forlorn glances during practice and  blushing whenever she was within speaking distance.</p>
<p>Outside, she  and Erika managed an unstuttered, fully-clothed conversation, though  Rei noticed that the other girl was still acting a little nervous, her  eyes darting about while she fidgeted with the hem of her gym shirt.</p>
<p>“Coach said my form is getting better but for some reason, my aim is getting worse. I was hoping you could help me out.”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded and they went to select their equipment. “I could watch you  shoot a few times and maybe I’ll be able to see what’s going wrong.”</p>
<p>With a huge smile, Erika nodded. “That would be great!”</p>
<p>They  took up lanes next to each other and Rei inspected her running shoes  while Erika prepared her bow and set her arrows into their stand. As  Erika began her shot, Rei watched studiously, examining all aspects of  her posture and technique. Her feet were a little off but everything  else looked fine and she seemed to be sighting properly, so it likely  wouldn’t affect her aim. When Erika finally released the arrow, it  struck several hand spans from the target’s center and she turned to  Rei with a pout.</p>
<p>“See?”</p>
<p>Rei gave a small, reassuring smile. “Yes. Fix your feet and try again.”</p>
<p>With  an embarrassed blush, Erika obeyed and her arrow went awry once again.  However, this time, Rei caught the small movement that was skewing the  other archer’s aim.</p>
<p>“You’re exhaling while you release. I think it’s making your shoulders shift.”</p>
<p>“Ahh.”  With a nod of comprehension, Erika strung her final arrow. She emptied  her lungs before her fingers let go of the feathered arrow and the bolt  met the board significantly closer to the center.</p>
<p>Satisfied, Rei set about stringing her own bow and setting up her arrows. Looking back up, she met Erika’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Thank  you,” the shorter girl said genuinely. “I really appreciate it. If  you’d like . . . I have two tickets to a professional archery  competition this weekend. We could go . . . but, but only if you want  to. I mean, if you don’t want to then that’s fine too . . .” She  trailed off expectantly, watching Rei hopefully.</p>
<p>Rei hesitated.  It wasn’t officially a date but she knew that Erika liked her and she  knew that she didn’t return the feelings. However . . . Erika was  really attractive, Rei realised somewhat clinically. Her features were  quite pretty, especially her large, dark eyes and her build was slender  and delicate.</p>
<p>What was it about Minako that set her apart from  other girls? By all rights, she ought to like Erika but Rei was at a  loss as to why she didn’t.</p>
<p>Here was the chance to find out.</p>
<p>“I’d love to,” she replied with a modest smile.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once  again, Rei was sitting in the Aino’s foyer, her foot dangling across  her knee. Idly, she contemplated claiming the chair she always occupied  in the morning as property of Hinoland. It wasn’t a bad chair – soft,  stylish and just the right height.</p>
<p>Akemi Aino came back from the  kitchen and handed Rei a steaming cup of coffee, explaining, “Minako  may be a while this morning. We got in a little late last night  –celebrations went on for quite a while after the game.”</p>
<p>“Even though they lost?”</p>
<p>Minako’s mother smiled and nodded. “I think they were just happy to be there. I’m sure you’ll hear all about it.”</p>
<p>“Mmm,” Rei agreed, eyeing her coffee.</p>
<p>“Would you like cream and sugar with that?”</p>
<p>“No,  Mother,” Minako said, entering the foyer. She was wearing fluffy  slippers with her uniform and her hair was still messy from sleep.  Striding over, she plucked the drink from Rei’s hand and turned toward  the kitchen. “Rei doesn’t like coffee. She just took it to be polite.”</p>
<p>Clanging  came from the kitchen and then the tap, followed by a click, and Rei  realised Minako had started the kettle to boil. “Do we really have time  for tea?” she asked when the young blonde re-entered the room.</p>
<p>“Yes, we do. We’re skipping our morning classes,” she stated.</p>
<p>Minako’s  mother took this as her cue to leave. “I’ll just be downstairs,” she  said breezily, “doing laundry and such, completely oblivious to what  you’re up to. Bye, Rei.”</p>
<p>“Er, bye,” Rei replied, wondering bemusedly if Minako realised how amazingly slack her mother was.</p>
<p>“Come,”  Minako beckoned. “Watch me eat breakfast. Oh, but first . . .” She spun  and stuck out her right hand. “Truce. I really can’t compete with evil  that knows no bounds. I mean, to sic my own mother on me. Diabolical.”</p>
<p>They  shook – Minako all business, Rei lightly amused – and then settled in  the kitchen. Minako put bread in the toaster, pulled out some jams, and  sat down next to Rei.</p>
<p>Rei gave her a strange look. “I expected  you to be a little more er . . . furious about your mother being your  chaperone. Instead you offer me a truce? You must be going soft  already, Aino.”</p>
<p>Minako smiled sweetly. “Consider it punishment in advance for what you’re going to go through some fine evening this week.”</p>
<p>“Eheh . . .” Rei wanted to hang her head and shake it. Of course there was a catch. “And what might that be?”</p>
<p>“Dinner with my parents.” Minako flipped her eyebrows up and down.</p>
<p>“Ah  . . .” was all she could think to say. Meet the parents – wasn’t that a  couply thing to do? Was she going to be grilled? Get stink-eye from  Minako’s father? The what-are-your-intentions-concerning-my-daughter  question? “When?” she croaked.</p>
<p>The blonde’s lips curled into a  darkly amused grin. “I still have to talk to papa about that – he’s  quite a busy man but he’s taking time off work for this, you know.”</p>
<p>“Really?”  Rei looked over the kettle, hoping it would boil quickly. She was  starting to feel parched. “He doesn’t have to do that.”</p>
<p>Minako  lightly waved this away. “No, no, he likes to keep informed on who I’m  hanging around with – get a measure of their character and all that.”</p>
<p>“And if he doesn’t approve?” Rei queried, not missing the fact that Minako was enjoying her growing fear of impending doom.</p>
<p>The blonde just smiled and shrugged innocently.</p>
<p>“Some truce,” the miko muttered.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Give  your Mii black hair. Here.” Minako put her hairbrush down and grabbed  Rei’s hand, moving the controller so that it selected the proper hair  colour. She let go promptly afterward, her actions and their timing  measured to allow her to enjoy the secret thrill she felt at having  Rei’s hand underneath her own without making it obvious.</p>
<p>Minako  returned to tending to her hair, tying some of it back with a ribbon  and checking her bangs in the mirror, while Rei sat on her bed and  created her Mii. Minako enjoyed the amused expression on the miko’s  face while she got the hang of using the controller. It was obvious she  didn’t play video games, but she wasn’t completely hopeless about it.  As with most subjects, Rei was quick to catch on. If their new  friendship worked out, Minako could see it might be possible to turn  her into decent competition.</p>
<p>“Now what do I do with this hideous replica of myself?” Rei asked, waving the Wii controller around.</p>
<p>“Now you play something. Pick a sport – try tennis,” she advised.</p>
<p>“Eh…” Rei looked blankly at the screen, unsure of which button to press.</p>
<p>Minako  grinned and grabbed the second controller, swapping it with the one in  Rei’s hand. “You can have first controller when you’re not such a noob.”</p>
<p>There  was silence where Minako had expected a scathing retort. Turning to  Rei, she saw the miko looking off with a confused frown.</p>
<p>Noticing the blonde’s attention, she asked, “What is a ‘noob’?”</p>
<p>Her  confused frown only deepened when Minako laughed at her without  answering the question. Rei opened her mouth to emphatically restate it  when noises on the TV distracted her. Tennis turned out to be rather  amusing once she got the hang of swinging her arm around. The way the  little bobble-headed character flailed around when it swung at the ball  was mildly hilarious.</p>
<p>Eventually, Rei noticed that Minako was  subtly paying more attention to her than the game, though she was still  winning which was slightly infuriating.</p>
<p>“Something on your mind?” she prompted bluntly when the match was over.</p>
<p>Minako  smiled sheepishly and then steeled her features with resolve. “About  what happened the night . . . the night I had my party, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>The  blonde knew that the apology had to seem like it was coming completely  out of the blue but sitting in her room next to Rei with everything  feeling so right and normal, Minako felt compelled to apologise for the  one time she hadn’t brought Rei to her room. The next few seconds where  she waited in silence as Rei digested the sudden shift to a subject  they had both been avoiding were the longest most painfully nervous  seconds of her life.</p>
<p>Finally, Rei frowned a little. “You’re apologising for . . . <em>that</em>? You didn’t make me do anything, Minako. <em>You</em> were the drunk one.”</p>
<p>Minako  winced a little but clarified, “I know, but I didn’t make it anything  special like it should have been. I didn’t even bring you to my room.  I’m sorry for making you think I didn’t care.”</p>
<p>She suffered a  long, measuring stare until Rei’s expression softened and the miko  shook her head. “I’m sorry it took us so long to have this  conversation. I ran away. It was . . . immature and I probably made you  think <em>I</em> didn’t care.”</p>
<p>Two relieved smiles flitted between  them and both girls were reassured, though eye contact remained a shy  affair. Too many questions remained but the topic was too new to  conversation and awkwardness stalled the momentum of progress. It was  overambitious to hope that all the words unsaid between them could come  rushing out at once but a step had finally been made decisively in the  right direction and more would come now that the first had been taken.</p>
<p>Turning  her attention back to the Wii to move past the growing silence, Minako  stood and rummaged in her pile of games. “So, tennis is fantastic, of  course, but wait until you try this.”</p>
<p>Rei read the disc Minako had spun about with triumphantly. “Rock . . . band?”</p>
<hr />
<p>“It’s official.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“Saturday night, you are invited to the Aino household for dinner.”</p>
<p>“Oh . . . Should I um . . . bring anything?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Just yourself and a smile!”</p>
<p>“Right. Is it gonna be like, er, formal? Do I wear something nice?”</p>
<p>“Haha, relax. It’s just dinner at my house. Wear pyjamas if you want.”</p>
<p>“Uh, I think not . . .”</p>
<p>“No? No jimmyjammies? Oh yeah! You don’t have any allergies, right?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Okay good. I didn’t think so but my mum wanted to know for sure. She’s pretty excited about this.”</p>
<p>“She is? Why?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me, she’s crazy, remember? Two pickles short a dime!”</p>
<p>“. . . Two . . . Never mind. What’s your dad like?”</p>
<p>“Haha, why? Nervous?”</p>
<p>“I – no. Just curious.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really . . . ? Gimme your hand. Ha! Sweaty palms – I knew it.”</p>
<p>“My palms are not sweaty!”</p>
<p>“Well, not really I guess, but don’t tell me you’re not nervous.”</p>
<p>“Keh. I’m just concerned about what I’m getting into – these people spawned <em>you</em> after all.”</p>
<p>“My dad at least is sane, so you don’t have to worry about both of them.”</p>
<p>“So just you and your mother then.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha.”</p>
<p>“Ow.”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> and my mom are more alike. You’re both freakin evil.”</p>
<p>“Bah. You deserved having your mom on that trip for pushing me into the fire alarm.”</p>
<p>“Please, it wasn’t that bad. All I did was give you a little free excitement and infamy!”</p>
<p>“Next time, spare me.”</p>
<p>“No way. Oooo! Did I tell you? I’ve decided where we should go this Friday.”</p>
<p>“Be still, my racing heart.”</p>
<p>“There’s an expo on this week that I think you should see. Guess what it’s for?”</p>
<p>“Do I have to?”</p>
<p>“Psychics! Remember when we first talked?”</p>
<p>“When you asked me about your test score and your boyfriend?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! You were right, you know . . .”</p>
<p>“Of course I was.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean . . . I . . . I forget . . . Anyway. I heard this guy at the expo can touch things and tell you where they’ve been.”</p>
<p>“Keh,  like that’s hard. ‘Let me see your watch, miss. Hmmm, I believe it’s  been on your wrist, am I correct?’ Most so-called psychics are full of  crap, not visions.”</p>
<p>“You’re a sceptic? But you can see the future!”</p>
<p>“It’s not as simple as that.”</p>
<p>“Huh, well you’ll see. It’ll be mind-blowing, I tell you. Mind. Blowing.”</p>
<p>“. . . Yes, Minako.”</p>
