<h1>True Destiny (part 2 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/trudest-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Haruka&#39;s opponent was not a man, and it was not a woman.  She almost 
gasped when she realized that she was being pitted against one of the 
legendary deadly youma warriors, formed when a human was possessed by a 
floating evil spirit after ignoring the tributes and laws of their 
ancestors.  The youma were unbeatable, untrainable, and just as deadly 
to their owners as their enemies.

Then Haruka spotted the tall pole in the center of the arena, and she 
almost fell to the ground.  Makoto, head hung, was roped to the pole, 
bait for the monster and incentive for Haruka to fight her best.  Makoto 
looked up, and her emerald eyes locked on Haruka&#39;s.  &quot;Help me,&quot; she 
whispered.  The youma, its red tentacles swirling around its body, spun 
at the faint words, ready and willing to kill the easy target.  Furious 
at Kurai&#39;s ploy, Haruka jumped at the youma as the crowd cheered.  It 
was her toughest fight ever; alone, Haruka dodged the attacks and 
protected her partner, unable to imagine fighting alone for the rest of 
her life.  She couldn&#39;t lose Makoto, she couldn&#39;t.
 
The fight was doomed from the beginning.  The youma, though a little 
angered by the woman&#39;s constant attacks, was not injured, and it easily 
threw Haruka to the ground.  Winded, lying at the foot of the pillar, 
Haruka wiped the blood off her forehead and touched Makoto&#39;s foot.  &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t protect you.&quot;
 
&quot;Then I&#39;ll protect you,&quot; Makoto whispered, closing her eyes and 
concentrating.  In the center of her forehead, a symbol easily 
recognizable as the astronomical sign for the planet Jupiter appeared, 
glowing green.  Pale blue lightning reached down for Haruka, touching 
the blonde as the youma stalked closer, ready to attack.  Winded by the 
power from her partner, Haruka closed her eyes, absorbing the power, and 
the symbol for the planet Uranus appeared in gold on her forehead.  She 
opened her eyes, throwing her free hand up to protect her face, and she 
watched in awe as the youma fell back, glowing red as it fainted.  
Dizzy, Haruka leaned back, and her world went dark.  She never noticed 
the elegant, aqua-haired woman in the crowd or that her partner was also 
unconscious.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Stop it!&quot;
 
Kurai froze where he stood, anxiously looking up into the crowd.  The 
voice had come from the young daughter of Kanto Region Duke Kaiou Tsuyu 
and Duchess Kaiou Shousha, and she was quickly heading down into the 
arena, flanked by three guards and five attendants.  Kurai bowed 
nervously, wondering why young Duchess Kaiou Michiru was at his arena 
and why she wanted to see him.  &quot;Yes, my Lady?&quot;
 
&quot;That was cruel!  That woman on the pole had no chance to defend herself 
and you should not pit your fighters against a youma.&quot;
 
Kurai shrugged.  &quot;She won.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s a miracle,&quot; Kaiou Michiru hissed.  &quot;Those two are no longer your 
concern.  I am taking possession of the pair and that youma.&quot;
 
Kurai stared at the lady, unable to believe his ears.  &quot;What?  But they 
belong to me.  I adopted them fifteen years ago and they belong to me.  
I have papers.&quot;
 
&quot;Then you had better send one of your lackeys after them.  Because I am 
taking Kino Makoto and Ten&#39;ou Haruka with me.&quot;  Young Duchess Kaiou&#39;s 
expression brooked no argument, and the seven guards that joined her 
dared Kurai to disobey their master.  Caught, Kurai sent three of his 
men to his office after the papers he had for the pair of orphaned 
fighters, regretting his decision to make the fight more interesting.  
Ten minutes later, the two women were safely in the back of Michiru&#39;s 
limousine, and the lady was crouched by the youma&#39;s side.  Haruka&#39;s 
final desperate attack had miraculously changed the youma back into a 
human, and the unconscious, black-haired Shinto priestess was also sent 
to Michiru&#39;s car.  Kurai admitted that he had only found the youma, so 
he did not possess her, allowing the Duke of Kanto&#39;s only daughter to 
leave the Tokyo Fighting Palace and return to her father&#39;s home.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka woke slowly, warm and comfortable for the first time in her life.  
She opened her eyes to find herself in a huge canopied bed, occupying an 
even larger, gold bedroom.  Slowly, uncertain where she was or what she 
would find, Haruka sat up and touched her forehead.  The cut was 
bandaged, as was her side where the youma&#39;s claws had injured her.  Her 
right hand, the one she had thrown up to protect herself from the youma, 
was also bandaged, and the fighter could feel it throbbing, not used to 
channeling power.
 
The door opened, and the fighter found herself in the corner, arms 
raised defensively, before she realized what she was doing.  The woman 
who entered her room, a beautiful maiden with shoulder-length aqua hair 
and deep sapphire eyes, smiled, a tray of food in her hand.  &quot;Are you 
hungry, Ten&#39;ou Haruka?  You&#39;ve been asleep all day.&quot;
 
Haruka unfolded herself, cautiously returning to the bed and taking the 
tray, watching the woman as she ate greedily.  She was hungry, and the 
food in her hands was far better than anything Kurai ever ate.  &quot;Who are 
you?&quot;
 
&quot;My name is Kaiou Michiru, daughter of the Duke and Duchess Kaiou of 
Kanto Region.  I was at the arena, and I brought you to my house after 
you fainted.&quot;
 
&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;Where is Mako-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s already awaked and clean.  Her wounds have been bandaged and she 
is eating well.  She wasn&#39;t as bad off as you.&quot;
 
&quot;Me?&quot;
 
&quot;You expended a lot of energy, Ten&#39;ou-san.&quot;
 
&quot;Call me Haruka.  Most people call me Haruka-kun.&quot;
 
Michiru bowed her head, knowing the fighter&#39;s masculine appearance, 
actions, and way of speaking were to protect her from the harsh 
realities of an orphaned life.  &quot;You can see Makoto-san as soon as you 
finish eating.  All three of you are weak and need to regain what 
strength you can.&quot;
 
&quot;Three?&quot;
 
&quot;The youma.  Because of you, she transformed back into her human state.  
She wants to thank you, by the way.&quot;
 
Haruka, finishing her meal, looked up at the lady.  &quot;Michiru-san, why 
are we here?&quot;
 
&quot;I took you away from the Fighting Palace.  Your adoption papers have 
been voided, and you are both free now.&quot;
 
&quot;Free?  Free of Kurai, never forced to fight again?  Mako-chan is free 
of the threat of his harem?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.  You can stay here as long as you need to, and we can find you 
jobs or your real families, if you wish.&quot;
 
&quot;Families?&quot;
 
Michiru smiled at the look on Haruka&#39;s face.  &quot;Yes, my reluctant 
fighter.  My father&#39;s scientists can easily determine your lineage and 
Makoto-san&#39;s.  Who knows, maybe you guys have family out there somewhere 
who can take you in.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be separated from Mako-chan.  We&#39;ve only had each other 
for fifteen years, and I can&#39;t abandon her now.&quot;
 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; Michiru soothed.  &quot;We can find your families, but 
you don&#39;t have to go to them if you don&#39;t want to.  Finish your meal and 
I&#39;ll take you to Makoto-san.  She&#39;s waiting for you.&quot;
 
Makoto smiled at Haruka as the taller woman entered her room.  &quot;I see 
you&#39;re finally awake, Haru-chan.  Do you feel better?&quot;
 
Haruka enfolded the brown-haired woman in her arms, smiling to hold back 
the tears.  &quot;I was so worried about you,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Why would he 
use you as bait?&quot;
 
&quot;To provoke you, Haru-chan.  I thought that the youma would kill you; 
neither of us has ever fought alone before.  But you did well.&quot;
 
Haruka pulled back, sitting on the bed beside her partner, who was 
wearing a long, flowing green dress.  &quot;What was that, Mako-chan?  What 
did we do?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know and nobody here knows, either.  The Duchess of Tokyo 
Prefecture&#39;s Kanto Region, Kaiou Shousha, Michiru-san&#39;s mother, did say 
that power like ours is only ever seen among the nobility.  They&#39;re 
searching for our families now, to see if we are lords or something.  I 
really don&#39;t want to leave you, Haru-chan, even if they find our 
families.  We&#39;ve never been separated.&quot;
 
&quot;I know,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;Michiru-san promises me that we won&#39;t be 
forced to leave.  By the, way, whatever we did healed that youma.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?  But I thought that youma could not be healed.&quot;
 
&quot;Would you two like to meet her?&quot;  Haruka and Makoto looked up at 
Michiru&#39;s voice, having forgotten the young duchess for a moment. 
 
&quot;Yeah, we would.  Please.&quot;
 
&quot;Follow me, then, my young fighters.&quot;
 
Haruka, one arm wrapped securely around Makoto&#39;s waist, followed the 
aqua-haired duchess, and she smiled when she realized how much she 
wanted to fondle that hair.  She had always been drawn to women, but she 
had always assumed that it was a byproduct of the revulsion she felt 
toward men, mostly because of Kurai.  But Kaiou Michiru was quite 
beautiful.
 
The duchess opened a door three rooms down the hall, and a soft voice 
invited the three visitors in.  Haruka stopped still when she saw the 
woman crouched by the small altar in the corner, fingers intertwined in 
prayer.  &quot;Hino Rei!&quot;
 
Rei, her long, raven-black hair highlighted in red by the small fire, 
turned, a smile on her face.  &quot;Hello, Haruka-kun.  See?  I told you that 
I would get you out one day.&quot;
 
Haruka&#39;s mind flashed back to her meetings with the young priestess, who 
had been a constant visitor to the fighting palace.  She told Kurai that 
he had to keep his fighters in top condition by prayer, and he had 
allowed her presence in the Tokyo Fighting Palace for a full year.  Then 
he discovered that Rei had been sneaking food to his fighters and he 
kicked her out.  Before she left, Rei had promised Haruka and Makoto 
that she would one day free the pair from the arena.
 
&quot;But how did you get turned into a youma?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t remember that well.  I think my heart was corrupted because I 
ignored my prayers and my shrine for months, searching for a way to free 
you.  I found Michiru-san, and she agreed to get both of you out if I 
could arrange a meeting.  I planned to get Kurai to think that she 
wanted to talk to him about a special show, but I never got to see him.  
I was attacked by a strange woman and a daimon thing, and I don&#39;t 
remember anything else until I woke up here, yesterday morning.  All I 
know is that you two saved me.&quot;
 
&quot;We&#39;re not sure how,&quot; Haruka admitted, smiling.  &quot;But I&#39;m glad you&#39;re 
here.&quot;
 
&quot;My father has legions of guards searching for the demon woman who 
cursed you,&quot; Michiru interjected softly, &quot;but I do not hold much hope 
for their success.  For now, my friends, you are all welcome to stay 
here.&quot;
 
Rei smiled up at the duchess.  &quot;I have already enjoyed the comforts and 
hospitality of the Kanto Palace, Michiru-san.  My father, though, has no 
idea where I am, and I would like to call him.&quot;
 
Michiru smiled unexpectedly, eyes sparkling.  &quot;Perhaps it&#39;s Aino Minako 
you haven&#39;t spoken to in months.&quot;
 
Rei glared at the duchess, returning to her contemplations.  &quot;I have 
spoken to Minako recently, and she sends her best.  I really am worried 
about my father&#39;s reaction, though, because he wanted me to return three 
months ago and begin my training to take his place, since my Seijinshiki 
is fast approaching.  I really didn&#39;t want to, though, especially now, 
and I have to find a good excuse.&quot;
 
Haruka raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Rei-san?  Your father is a noble?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, sure.  He&#39;s Region Duke Hino Akaneiro of Kinki.  My family is in 
charge of Shiga, Mie, Nara, Wakayama, Osaka, Kyoto, and Hyogo 
Prefectures.  Since we govern Kyoto, all of the Hino daughters are 
expected to become Shrine Maidens before taking their titles, but I 
wanted to become a Shrine Maiden for different reasons than just 
tradition, mainly to help people like you and end the dominion of the 
Fighting Palaces.  I really never wanted to rule Kinki, anyway.  I have 
no choice, but I would like a little more adventure before I go home.&quot;
 
&quot;You said that your Seijinshiki is approaching.  When?&quot;
 
&quot;The Seijinshiki is in January.  I can&#39;t wait to be an adult, but I know 
my father will use it as an excuse to make me train for my position.  Do 
you know when you turn twenty?&quot;
 
Haruka shrugged, glancing at Makoto.  &quot;I know that I was about three or 
four when I was taken from the orphanage and that I&#39;ve been there almost 
fifteen years.  I don&#39;t know how old I am, but I do celebrate my 
birthday every year.  And Mako-chan&#39;s.&quot;
 
&quot;Haru-chan was born on January twenty-seventh and I was born on December 
fifth, so we fight extra-hard around New-Year&#39;s and have a big feast 
together.&quot;  Makoto looked away, fists clenched as she remembered why 
they had to hide their celebrations.  &quot;Well, we used to.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s all over now,&quot; Haruka whispered; &quot;we don&#39;t have to hide 
anymore.&quot;  Michiru was the only one to see the sudden spark in her 
blonde guest&#39;s deep emerald eyes, and she knew what it meant.  Haruka 
could let her feeling for her partner show without fear of their master, 
and she had powerful feelings for the shorter girl.  Michiru felt a 
strange and unexpected stab of jealousy for the bond the fighters 
shared, and she briefly wished that the blonde would look at her that 
way.  She let the feelings fade as she turned her attention back to the 
Shinto priestess.
 
&quot;Rei-san, I have a boat ready to take you home whenever you wish.  It&#39;s 
waiting in Tokyo Bay.&quot;
 
Rei bowed her head.  &quot;Thank-you, my friend.  I may leave in the morning.  
What will you do with these two?&quot;
 
Michiru laughed lightly.  &quot;I have no control over these two fighters.  
My people are searching for their families, but until then they may as 
well explore Japan.&quot;  She turned to Haruka and Makoto, smiling.  &quot;Where 
would you like to go?&quot;
 
Haruka, eyes wide, shrugged.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  I never thought any 
further than the ring.  Perhaps we could meet the other young duchesses, 
since you know them so well.  If we are nobles, we need to know our 
rulers.&quot;
 
&quot;Excellent idea!&quot;  Rei stood up from her fire and spun to face Michiru.  
&quot;Why don&#39;t we take them on a tour of the other Regions?  Maybe they can 
even meet the Princess.&quot;
 
Michiru shrugged, hands clasped sedately in front of her.  &quot;That sounds 
like a good idea.  I may need to speak to my parents first.&quot;
 
&quot;Ask them at supper.  You&#39;re having a feast in honor of our young 
guests; ask them then.  Then we can go to Kyushu to pick up Minako and 
go for a tour.&quot;
 
Michiru laughed as she left.  &quot;Minako,&quot; she chuckled.  &quot;Of course.&quot;
 
Haruka looked at the young priestess.  &quot;You have a girlfriend?&quot;
 
Rei shrugged.  &quot;I guess so, Haruka-kun.  We&#39;ve never really discussed 
it, but I guess she&#39;s my girlfriend.  Why?&quot;
 
Haruka led Makoto to the door and sent her back to the room Michiru had 
given her, asking the girl to get some rest before the feast that night, 
sitting down beside Rei when her brown-haired partner left.  &quot;Rei-san, 
how do you know that you love someone?&quot;
 
&quot;There are many kinds of love, Haruka-kun.  You&#39;re asking how I knew 
that I loved Minako.&quot;  The blonde nodded.  &quot;Well, I&#39;m not sure.  It&#39;s 
not like I woke up one day and realized that I loved her, but it&#39;s not 
like it happened over a long period of time, either.  I&#39;m a duchess; I 
understand that I&#39;m expected to have an heir to carry on the Hino name.  
My parents have been encouraging me to begin to think about a husband 
for a very long time, but I was far too involved with my priestess 
duties to worry about that.  I&#39;ve known Minako for years, and she came 
to my shrine often.  She was a very good friend.  I realized that I 
liked her a lot, but I wasn&#39;t going to say anything to ruin our 
friendship.  Until she got herself a boyfriend.  The day she told me, I 
realized that I was jealous.  It took me a while; I tried to deny that I 
was falling in love with a girl, but it didn&#39;t work.  They day she broke 
up with her boyfriend, I was there to comfort her, and she figured out 
how I felt for her.  I guess it freaked her out, because we didn&#39;t speak 
for a month, but she came back to me.  She didn&#39;t want to believe that 
she was a lesbian, but she was willing to believe that she loved me.  My 
love for her is so very strong, Haruka-kun.  I don&#39;t know how I know 
that I love her, but I do.&quot;
 
&quot;You realized that you were gay when you fell for her?&quot;
 
&quot;Basically.  Why?&quot;
 
&quot;Kurai used and abused me for fifteen years, Rei-san, and Mako-chan, 
too.  He&#39;s the only man I&#39;ve ever really known, and I hate him.  I&#39;ve 
been protecting her for that long because I hate him, but does that mean 
that I love her?  Does that mean that I&#39;ll hate all men?  That I&#39;m a 
lesbian?&quot;
 
Rei shook her head.  &quot;No, it doesn&#39;t.  Maybe you&#39;ll meet a nice guy, or 
maybe your protective sisterly love for Makoto-san will steer you toward 
other women.  You could be straight, or maybe not.  Keep your mind and 
your heart open, Haruka-kun; love will find you.  Fate knows who your 
soulmate is, and nothing can break the red string that binds you to that 
person.  Don&#39;t worry.&quot;
 
Haruka smiled.  &quot;Thank you, Rei-san.  I&#39;m going to go see how 
Mako-chan&#39;s doing.&quot;  As the tall blonde left, Rei stood up.
 
&quot;You know, Haruka-kun, Makoto-san is not the only beautiful woman out 
there, if you swing that way.  Michiru-san, for example, is very 
beautiful.&quot;
 
Haruka couldn&#39;t stop her mind from latching onto the image of the 
aqua-haired woman, wondering if she was as nice as she seemed or if she 
was just being a good hostess.  &quot;She is, Rei-san.  I&#39;ll try to remember 
that.  I&#39;ll see you at the feast.&quot;
 
Rei watched the blonde leave, shaking her head.  &quot;Oh yeah, she&#39;s gay.  
But I wonder who she&#39;ll fall for.  She has a very close bond with 
Makoto-san, but it&#39;s a very familial bond.  We&#39;ll see.&quot;</pre>
