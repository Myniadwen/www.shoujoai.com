----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Who?&quot;
 
&quot;Urakaze Haruka, Highness.  Princess Rei sent a message earlier 
mentioning him; he is a great swordsman and a peerless unarmed fighter.  
She suggests that the two of you might benefit from his skills.&quot;
 
Mizuno Ami stood up and walked to the door, opening it to look at the 
tall man who waited there.  &quot;Urakaze Haruka?&quot;
 
&quot;I am.  Are you Princess Mizuno Ami of Suisei?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.  Rei-chan tells us that you can train us.&quot;
 
&quot;I can.  And I can also provide advice on life.&quot;
 
Ami smiled at his words, entranced and curious.  The blue-haired woman 
let the visitor in, and her taller, protective brown-haired fighter 
friend joined her.  Makoto didn&#39;t trust strangers and she didn&#39;t want 
Ami to get hurt.  &quot;Fighter, huh?  Let me see how good you are, 
Urakaze-san.&quot;
 
Haruka handed the sword on his hip to Ami, asking her to take care of 
the heirloom.  Haruka followed Makoto into the center of the room, and 
the princess transformed into Sailor Jupiter.  Haruka nodded, and the 
fight began.
 
Jupiter rushed Haruka, and he stepped to one side at the last second, 
grabbing her arm and twisting it behind her back, holding Jupiter still.  
Makoto growled and detransformed, returning to Ami&#39;s side.  &quot;How did you 
do that?  I was Sailor Jupiter and you&#39;re just the son of a Duke.&quot;
 
&quot;I practiced with King Ten&#39;ou Koshu.  I also learned sword fighting from 
the king.  I can teach you, if you&#39;d like.&quot;
 
Makoto inclined her head, accepting the challenge.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka removed his thin practice sword from the princess&#39;s throat again 
and bowed.  &quot;Again, your highness?&quot;
 
&quot;No, not again, Haruka-kun.&quot;  Over the past few days, they had become 
close friends, and Makoto smiled when she growled at the young duke.  &quot;I 
think I&#39;ll go lie down for a while; Ami-chan might want some help.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll rest, then.  You&#39;ve improved, Makoto-san.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Ami slipped into the darkened room, her blue eyes adjusting to the 
semi-darkness.  Her best friend, the woman she would easily give her 
life for, lay on the bed, exhausted, wearing little more than her 
undergarments.  Ami smiled tolerantly as she pulled the dark green 
blanket over Makoto&#39;s chilled body, and the princess&#39;s eyes opened.  
&quot;Ami-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;Go to sleep, Mako-chan,&quot; Ami whispered lovingly.  &quot;I just came in here 
to see how much you hurt today.  I haven&#39;t come to see you in a long 
time.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m cold,&quot; Makoto whispered suggestively, but the blue-haired girl 
pulled back.  Her hair wasn&#39;t much longer than Haruka&#39;s but the cut was 
far more feminine.  &quot;Just tonight, Ami-chan, please?  You haven&#39;t in a 
while.  I love it when you stay to keep me warm.&quot;
 
&quot;You need to get some sleep, love.&quot;
 
&quot;Sleep?  What&#39;s that?&quot;  Makoto pouted, and Ami felt her heart flutter.  
Those emerald eyes could always sway her.
 
But she wouldn&#39;t give in without some sort of token resistance.  &quot;We 
promised that we&#39;d stop.  Father&#39;s found me a suitor and everything and 
I have to respect his wishes.&quot;
 
&quot;You don&#39;t, Ami-chan, you don&#39;t.  Please, just once more.  Haruka&#39;s 
visit is a special occasion, and you said you&#39;d grace my bed on a 
special occasion.&quot;
 
Ami tried to resist, but her heart was on Makoto&#39;s side.  &quot;Okay, but 
just because you fought with Haruka today and you&#39;re sore and cold.&quot;  
Ami slipped under the covers next to Makoto and let the tall, 
brown-haired fighter wrap her arms around her.  &quot;I think you are the 
warm one, Mako-chan.&quot;
 
&quot;Perhaps.  Good night, Ami-chan.  Aishiteru.&quot;
 
&quot;Aishiteru, atashi no megami.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka laughed inside her head, careful to keep even the smile off her 
face.  She was finally beginning to figure out why the Sailor Senshi 
were such a wonderful team&#151;they were all desperately in love with each 
other.  They would all eventually marry men, Ami had told Makoto as 
much, and all of them would be happy.  But would they ever really love 
their husbands?  Could they ever love their husbands as much as they 
loved their partners?  Was that why Queens never remarried?  Was that 
why Queen Serenity never seemed as lonely when surrounded by her lesser 
queens?  She was alone, but she wasn&#39;t lonely.
 
Did that mean that she would dream about other soldiers when lying 
beside her king in the future?  Wasn&#39;t there one sailor senshi that 
didn&#39;t like to sleep with her partners?  Maybe Queen Pluto, but none of 
the others.  Oh, maybe the Princess of Dosei because everyone was afraid 
each princess might become Sailor Saturn, but that was all.  Haruka 
suddenly thought about her mother for the first time in years, and she 
wondered who had come to visit Kazeko during her last moments.  Was it 
her father Koshu, or was he too busy with &quot;affairs of state&quot;?  Did one 
of the Senshi visit Kazeko as Haruka was being born?
 
Haruka slipped away from Makoto&#39;s room and found the control and 
communications room for the grand Io Castle, waiting for the servants to 
slip away for a late-night snack before entering herself and sitting 
down at a shadowed alcove.  No one should notice her.  Deft fingers 
flying over the controls, Haruka quickly accessed the main computer bank 
and information retrieval archive on the Moon, heart of the Silver 
Millennium, searching.  She knew most of the access codes and could 
break into those areas that denied her entry, and she found what she was 
looking for.  On the day she was born, her father was called away to the 
moon for a conference with the King of the Moon and the other Lesser 
Kings, while all of the queens save the oldest, Setsuna&#151;who was probably 
busy at the Time Gate&#151;gathered to support Kazeko.  During the long 
labor, only two of the queens had sent messages back to the Moon.
 
Queen Serenity&#39;s terse account read, &quot;She has been in labor too long; 
there is a great deal of blood and I fear she may not survive the night.  
Oh, my love, I know that I mustn&#39;t do anything to alter the choices of 
destiny&#151;your vigil has taught me that&#151;but I wish there was something one 
of us could do.&quot;  The letter was addressed to her husband, indicating 
that Koshu should not know his wife&#39;s dire situation.  Haruka wondered 
about some of the wording in the second sentence, but she brushed her 
worries away.  The King of the Moon must have had some power of his own, 
wherever he came from, though she wondered about &#145;vigil&#39;.  The second 
note was from Queen Kaiou Shousha to her younger sister on Kaiousei, and 
it was filled with emotion.
 
&quot;Imouto-chan, Kazeko is in trouble.  We know that the child is her 
daughter, her heir, but labor should not take so long.  She&#39;s in such 
pain, sis, and I wish there was something I could do.  Serenity fears 
that Kazeko will die, and I could not stand that.  I already lost Mom 
and Dad and my stillborn son; I can&#39;t lose everyone I love so close 
together!  If Kazeko dies, I promise you that I will never speak to her 
daughter, to the child that takes her life.  Pray tonight; pray for my 
Kazeko.  Shousha-yori.&quot;
 
Haruka found that her hands had closed into fists as she read the 
letter.  It wasn&#39;t her fault!  Kazeko, though a rebel and a little of 
the tomboy her daughter had become, had nevertheless always been 
delicate and was never expected to survive to see her heir transform 
into Sailor Uranus.  Haruka reached into her pocket and pulled out her 
henshin stick, staring at the blue planet and yellow star on top.  &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Mother,&quot; she whispered, finding tears on her cheeks unexpectedly.  
She never cried! 
 
&#145;I forgive you . . .&#39;
 
The feeling surrounded her, comforting the young Senshi, and Haruka knew 
without a doubt that some part of her mother&#39;s essence remained to 
comfort her.  &quot;She loved you.  Did you love her?  Did you love her more 
than my father?&quot;
 
&#145;The love Senshi share is different, more eternal, and follows through 
our lives.  I did and I always will.  You&#39;ll understand.&#39;
 
&quot;Do we have Soulmates, then?&quot;
 
&#145;You can answer that for yourself.  Good luck on your journey, and 
follow your heart.  I wish I had.&#39;
 
Haruka nodded, glancing up at a sound behind her.  Quickly, she shut the 
computer console down and slipped into the shadows, her stick still in 
her hand.  As she disappeared into the castle, she wondered if that 
servant had seen her.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;It was the most miraculous thing, your highness!  I saw Queen Ten&#39;ou 
Kazeko&#39;s ghost in the control room, complete with Space Sword and 
henshin stick!&quot;
 
Makoto smiled tolerantly at the excited servant.  Looking up as Haruka 
entered the throne room, Makoto gestured for her friend to join the 
princesses on the dais.  &quot;He tells us that he saw the ghost of Ten&#39;ou 
Kazeko in the control room last night.&quot;
 
Haruka&#39;s heart flipped, but he kept his half-smile in place.  &quot;Really?  
How interesting.  Was she Sailor Uranus or the queen?&quot;
 
&quot;Neither,&quot; the servant answered.  &quot;She was just a fleeting shadow, but I 
know it was her because I saw the sword.&quot;
 
Haruka smiled tolerantly at the servant.  &quot;Perhaps she did visit you 
last night, and you were lucky enough to glimpse her.  If she did, then 
I leave Io Castle in good hands.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re leaving?&quot;
 
&quot;Unfortunately, Ami-san, I have business on the Moon and cannot tarry 
here any more.  I have greatly enjoyed my visit and you have been most 
hospitable.&quot;
 
Ami took Haruka&#39;s hand in a friendly gesture as she prepared to bid the 
Duke&#39;s son a kind farewell.  &quot;Haruka-kun, you have been a fine teacher 
in the art of combat, but I lost my mother when I was small and have 
already learned enough of that in my training to become Sailor Mercury.  
You told us when you arrived that you had advice on life.  I hope that 
you were not exaggerating.&quot;
 
Haruka, in a gesture he was not accustomed to using, took Ami&#39;s hand in 
his and bent down to her eye level.  &quot;There is not enough time in one 
short life to live as you would wish and as your father would wish.  
Embrace the truth you know in your heart and take hold of those you love 
for they will not always be around.  Kazeko was very much in love with 
one of her equals, but they gave up their feelings for duty and their 
planets.  She died young, never knowing her child or realizing her full 
dream.  Do not let that happen to you, Mizuno Ami, Friend of Water.  You 
will regret the moments if you do not experience all life has to offer.  
That is my advice to you and Kino Makoto.  Good luck and do not forget.&quot;  
Haruka took Ami&#39;s chin in his hand and brushed her lips with his.  He 
felt the slightest spark of family, belonging, and he smiled as he 
slipped out the door.  In his mind, music, beautiful, sweet, and true, 
danced with the wind.
 
Makoto caught Ami as she swayed, staring curiously after the young duke.  
&quot;He knows, Mako-chan.  Oh how he knows.  He is so very lonely and in so 
much pain, yet he travels to our castles and tells us how to be happy.  
I feel so sorry for him, Mako-chan.&quot;
 
&quot;I know, Ami-chan.  I know.&quot;  Makoto pulled Ami into her arms and held 
the smaller princess, contemplating Haruka&#39;s words.  Who was that duke, 
anyway?  She grinned as she nuzzled the shorter princess&#39;s neck.  &quot;Ne, 
Ami?  How did it feel to kiss a guy?&quot;
 
&quot;Makoto!  I don&#39;t kiss and tell!&quot;  Ami grinned as she turned around in 
her lover&#39;s arms, feeling unusually affectionate.  &quot;I will tell you that 
he&#39;s not nearly as good as you.&quot;
 
Makoto answered the only way she could.</pre>
