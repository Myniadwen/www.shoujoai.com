&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot;

We were all seated around a desk in a cushy looking room. The place 
certainly seemed extravagant; with the pink, fuzzy rug that blanketed 
the floor and various plush animals littered the shelves...speaking of 
shelves, they appeared to be connected in an odd pattern, making me feel 
slightly uneasy. Looking at the mass amount of structures whole they 
formed a giant maze or a giant computer network with the lights blinking 
erratically on their metal sides. I looked up towards the ceiling, 
observing the population of wind instruments. Strange...I found my eyes 
narrowing at the suspicious items. There&#39;s no wind in this practically 
air tight office, even I had trouble breathing in here!

&quot;Aren&#39;t they beautiful?&quot; Manuke mused. I did admit, the mix of colors 
did attract my eye but that wasn&#39;t the only reason.

&quot;I suppose so...&quot;

Both our eyes met with a suspicious gaze, obviously searching each 
other&#39;s eyes for an answer to whatever was on our minds. Keeping the 
contact I quickly emptied myself of all emotion, everything of my being 
rebelliously rebuffed Manuke; his voice, words, false smile. He was 
hiding something. Whether or not Minako had realized it, I had and I 
wasn&#39;t about to let anything slip for both our sakes.

&quot;I-It&#39;s kind of hot in here isn&#39;t it?&quot; Minako suddenly squeaked 
nervously. &quot;Hard to breathe...&quot; She half whispered the comment.

I had wanted to scold her, to tell her that the air wasn&#39;t heavy here 
because of the heating system but backing down from Manuke&#39;s gaze wasn&#39;t 
an option. Instead to my satisfaction I growled at that man,

&quot;She said she&#39;s feeling hot.&quot; I watched his face, waiting to see if his 
mind would think to perverted thoughts at the suggestion. Slowly his 
expression relaxed but snapped suddenly into a frown when the 
realization hit him. Only for a split second, but it was there. The 
corners of my mouth curled upwards in a smug smirk.

&quot;Yes...the air is a bit warm in here...&quot; Manuke finally spoke up, no 
doubt trying to clear up any suspicion of his intentions in case Minako 
had also noticed. But she didn&#39;t, the blonde only nodded her head in 
quick motions. The dark haired man picked up a large fan from behind his 
desk and turned it on. For a moment I stared at the blades, trailing 
them as they sped up with intense concentration. Really I was watching 
the figure behind those metal pieces. The moment was broken when Manuke 
moved to place the fan on a corner of the desk.

&quot;Back to business...&quot; He shoved the contract towards me again. &quot;Yes, 
this is all that there is to it, nothing more, nothing less.&quot;

I found myself looking over the parchment again. Every word may have 
looked so innocent to the average person but I wasn&#39;t convinced. There 
was something that bothered me, about this paper, about this place. 
Or...am I being too paranoid?

&quot;Rei, come on...&quot; Minako was getting anxious. She wouldn&#39;t stop 
fidgeting.

Scanning through the print there was only line that stood out in 
particular.

&quot;You&#39;ll be our manager?&quot; The idea had greatly disgusted me.

&quot;Yes, unfortunately no one else in our company is trained or available 
for the position currently. However...that does not mean it cannot 
change in future time.&quot;

&quot;There is no other option?&quot; &#39;I don&#39;t like you&#39; I directed the thought to 
the blackmailer.

&quot;Afraid not.&quot; &#39;Deal with it&#39; came the response.

&quot;Rei, it&#39;s not the end of the world.&quot; Minako tried to convince me. I 
shot her a disbelieving look. &quot;Manuke said so himself, it&#39;s only 
temporary.&quot;

&quot;Or maybe, Minako...Rei doesn&#39;t care about you.&quot; Manuke smugly stated.

The sentence hung in the air as if it were bait for vultures. It stunk 
and it infuriated me. I could only look at my companion as she trembled 
slightly, tears welling in those hurt cerulean eyes. The pain...could 
she really believe this...this stranger?

&quot;That&#39;s not it!&quot; I spat at Manuke as he lay his head on his hands, 
watching my reaction with a knowing look.

&quot;Rei...&quot; Minako squeaked out. Oh damn it! The world seems to be against 
me in this. For awhile numbly was I aware my fingers were drumming the 
hard desk surface. What to do, what to do?

&quot;It&#39;s not true Mina...&quot; I tried. A small light of hope broke through the 
swirl of emotions in the blonde&#39;s eyes. Slowly I found myself sighing 
thoughtfully, closing my eyes and taking in some deep breaths. &quot;Would 
you leave us for a moment Mina chan?&quot;

&quot;But Rei!&quot;

&quot;Trust me on this....&quot; I silently begged. When she did not move I added 
quickly but softly, &quot;Please...&quot;

Never had I been polite about anything, even I was conscious of my 
flaws. But in times such as this I did not want her to see this, what 
was about to happen. The woman stood up and walked out of the room with 
such dignity that the average person wouldn&#39;t have noticed that she was 
crying. Silent sobs, anxiety and nervousness radiated from the depths of 
her soul. I couldn&#39;t have see at first when I first met the woman...no, 
the leader of the inner senshi must be strong at all costs but there 
were the signs. Please be strong a little longer Mina chan...

The door locked with a click.

Minako&#39;s POV

I heard the door lock with a small click behind me. Why did Rei ask me 
to leave? I thought we were a team; that we&#39;d go through any &#39;mission&#39; 
together.

&quot;What are you thinking Rei?&quot; I half whispered to myself.

For a split second I considered listening in on their conversation but 
soon that thought was confirmed impossible judging by the door&#39;s 
structure; thick steel, no cracks at the bottom or side. Whoever had 
built it, they sure didn&#39;t want to risk someone eavesdropping. Feeling 
slightly flustered I strolled stiffly to the mass of huddled chairs 
directly across in the room. There was a flop as I through myself down 
onto the black leather.

Flop.

The silence around the halls crashed into my ears again. I found myself 
burrowing my face into my hands. Everything was riding on 
this...everything...While I was stuck out here, useless, my best friend 
who is known to be very short tempered was talking to the contractor 
and...they hate each other&#39;s existence! Good or bad, Kami, please let 
this end quickly...

Rei&#39;s POV

No other sound punctuated the heavy atmosphere say for the wobbles of 
the fan. That was, until the arrogant son of a man had dared into the 
danger zone.

&quot;Usually you&#39;re so calm and composed. What happened?&quot; He sneered.

&quot;Quite an act you put up in the alleyway.&quot; I calmly responded. He was 
pushing it, ever so close now.

&quot;Heh...I&#39;d be more concerned about the matter at hand. You know you have 
no choice; are you really willing to risk your friendship?&quot; He leaned 
forward onto his elbows. I found my hands clenching, changing into a 
deep red in my lap. &quot;She may never forgive you.&quot;

That was true, it was Mina&#39;s dream after all. But was putting her well 
being into a potentially questionable situation worth it? Both sides of 
me screamed &#39;no&#39; but they did not want to lose the adorable blonde&#39;s 
friendship either. If that was gone, everything would be lost.

&quot;Or I might just make the contract for her. I can tell her she doesn&#39;t 
need you... and who do you think she&#39;ll believe?&quot; The worm inched closer 
until his face was beside my ear. &quot;Quite the goddess isn&#39;t she? Maybe 
when it&#39;s all over...&quot;

&quot;URUSAI!&quot;

Bam!

Suddenly I was on my feet, glaring down at the lowlife situated beneath 
me. I had clobbered the loud mouth. The evidence left was his head lying 
on the cool desk. Small trickle of blood smudged the black solid as he 
looked up at me. I scowled; nothing serious about a bloody lip...But he 
deserved so much more! Human, he&#39;s only human I told myself, hoping the 
information would hold back the anger swelling in my chest. Even if he&#39;s 
insufferable, blackmailing twit! My fist automatically came up over my 
head, aiming for another blow when his small chuckle froze the action.

&quot;Feisty aren&#39;t you?&quot; Manuke was laughing in my face. &quot;Amazing...But...&quot; 
He pointed up to the wind instruments hanging above us from the ceiling. 
&quot;I don&#39;t advise any more violence.&quot;

A small sparkle in a crooked neck of one instrument had told me 
everything.

&quot;Video cameras?&quot; Curses instantly came to mind.

The man grinned as he gathered himself together and walked around the 
structure to meet me face to face. I noticed how he brought himself up 
to full height to stare me down. &quot;Make your choice.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll do it.&quot; I growled. There was no way I&#39;d leave Mina alone, 
especially with him.

&quot;Sign here.&quot;

Those few minutes were the longest minutes of my life. Never had I felt 
so irritated with the presence standing behind my back, scratch that, 
I&#39;ve never been this irritated period! Compared to the time where Minako 
had called me every five minutes to consider this deal I could honestly 
say this was worse. Much worse.

&quot;There, all done.&quot; I threw the pen at the bastard and made a motion to 
leave, turning towards the door.

&quot;I hope your beautiful friend isn&#39;t as temperamental as you are...Rei 
chan.&quot; He cooed.

Forgetting the cameras, in a split second I felt my foot pivot on the 
spot as I lashed out. Feeling the material of his tie in my hands I 
threw all my energy into crashing the heavy body into the closest wall.

Thud!

&quot;If you ever hurt her...I&#39;ll kill you.&quot; I whispered in a calm voice to 
him. So calm it even surprised me but the hatred was there nevertheless.

The shocked look on Manuke&#39;s face convinced me that he heard my threat. 
Which was very good because I was definitely not in the mood to repeat 
it. I released the figure, watching briefly as he slumped onto the pink 
carpeting. Perhaps he isn&#39;t used to women standing up for themselves or 
fighting back was my conclusion. Well that&#39;s life; it&#39;s full of 
unexpected surprises. Now that the two of us will be working together 
he&#39;d better be get used to it.

I found myself smirking as I left through the room. Only days ago had I 
been cursing life and my existence but now I was laughing at it. 
Amusing...

&quot;Rei!&quot; Minako spoke up as I entered the spacious hallway. She had been 
waiting on one of the chairs outside. Curiously I noticed some people 
were wandering around, maybe its their break.

&quot;No worries Mina chan, we&#39;re all hooked up.&quot; I gave her a thumbs up.

&quot;You mean it?&quot; She started forward. The way her jaw dropped told me she 
was disbelieving what I had said.

&quot;Absolutely!&quot; I flashed her a smile.

&quot;Eeeeeeee!&quot; The blonde squealed as she tackled me with a flying hug. Her 
arms flew around my neck in a sudden rush and I had not been ready for 
such a reaction.

&quot;Gah!&quot; I gasped as I stepped back to brace for the full weight of the 
figure falling on me. &quot;Careful Mina chan!&quot; Pairs of curious eyes watched 
us from a distance. &quot;Could you say this for later?&quot; I whispered into the 
woman&#39;s ears. They seemed to perk up at the words before she finally 
released me.

&quot;Gomen ne Rei chan! I-I just...&quot; Minako blushed.

&quot;Got excited, I know.&quot; For a moment there it had also made me excited. 
No! Bad thoughts I mentally slapped myself. A blush had started to creep 
around the corners of my cheeks sending me into a panic. Change the 
subject! my mind commanded &quot;Now let&#39;s go, I need some sleep!&quot; I 
hurriedly turned to leave, not ready to face Minako anytime within the 
next few minutes. Almost made it too until a strong force had grasped 
hold of one of my arms. &quot;Mina chan?&quot; I looked down to see her clinging 
to me as if her life depended on it. Kami, I hope she wasn&#39;t crying. I 
wouldn&#39;t know what to do if she was.

&quot;Arigato Rei chan...for staying with me.&quot; She looked up, tears welling 
in her eyes. Never did she let go.

I was speechless at first; too captivated by the gratitude radiating 
from her delicate face. Very rarely had anyone had been so happy to be 
near me, even when the sailor senshi were together. Always had people 
kept their distance from me, since the beginning. Partially it was my 
fault for being so reserved but it wasn&#39;t always like that. It all 
started because they left me to fumble through the days alone when I 
needed them the most. Abandoned was the word. My parents...so called 
friends.

I watched Minako for a few more seconds, patting her back in a 
reassuring way. Now that someone needs me...

&quot;It&#39;s all right Mina chan.&quot;

Minako silently nodded her head and cried into my shoulder for a few 
minutes before we walked out the door in silence, enjoying each other&#39;s 
presence. I didn&#39;t want to think about the contract or Manuke...Kami, 
let this moment last just awhile longer.

Back in the office

The door locked again with a click.

&quot;W-What a barbarian of a woman!&quot; Manuke exclaimed, still on the floor 
from the last encounter with an angry fire goddess. &quot;I can see why you 
want her out of the way.&quot; He directed his attention to the shadow in the 
corner of his office room.

&quot;The job...&quot;

&quot;It will be done soon enough, be patient. Once she&#39;s out of the 
way...I&#39;ll get the other girl won&#39;t I?&quot; The man picked himself up and 
ventured towards the cushy chair where his guest had positioned 
conveniently.

The mass of black energy met him as the man had seated and started to 
rummage through daily documents. Upon contact his eyes clouded over with 
a red haze. The only solid reply of a promise of &#39;yes&#39; echoed through 
his dream like state.

&quot;Heh.&quot; Manuke smirked. Then in a voice not his alone he darkly promised, 
&quot;Time will tell...Mars.&quot;

Minako&#39;s POV, end of the day, starts in a dream

I ran through the battlefield, hoping to find you. Where are you? 
Vaguely I could hear my footsteps mush into the weak, mud-like ground. 
My own breathing had picked up significantly as screams and cries of 
people battling around me grew louder. The dreaded question burned its 
way into my mind every moment, &#39;were you all right?&#39;

&quot;HAAA!&quot;

My steps came to a skidding stop as I finally spotted you. 
Fighting...But something was very wrong. The senshi of fire shot various 
fireballs into the mass of human soldiers, all screaming their last 
breathes before crumbling into piles of ash.

&quot;Mars, what are you doing!&quot; I screamed. This couldn&#39;t be happening, it 
couldn&#39;t be her, it just...can&#39;t be. Everything inside went cold 
watching the horrific massacre take place before me. Blood splattered 
through the air and was absorbed into the barren, dusty ground, dying it 
a crimson red. Their screams continued, filled with so much pain, 
evidence of their quick suffering.

&quot;Stop it, stop it...&quot; My head hung low, staring at the ground. I could 
see another stream of blood flow towards my feet. &quot;STOP IT! Venus 
love-me chain!&quot; A chain of glowing hearts zoomed the senshi of fire. The 
other woman briefly glanced behind her shoulder as hard amethyst eyes 
met mine before she evaded the attack. &quot;Why are you attacking our 
allies!&quot; I demanded.

The chain did a double take and aimed for Mars again.

&quot;Gah!&quot; Mars winced, taking a nick to her cheek. A red scratch marred the 
spot where the blow had landed.

&quot;Tell me!&quot; I couldn&#39;t accept what I had witnessed. Where was the Mars I 
loved, the Mars who was loyal, strong and compassionate?

Her cold eyes bore down into me, as though she was searching for 
something. I bit my bottom lip as I met that gaze.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; She asked me. &quot;Answer me.&quot; Besides completely brushing 
off my question to my surprise her voice almost had croaked. What the 
hell was she talking about?

&quot;You know who I am.&quot; I sternly replied. The other woman eyed me 
suspiciously, what did I do to deserve that look? Confusion whirled 
about as I tried to grip everything that has come to pass. I gripped the 
golden chain in my palms tightly. She killed them, slaughtered them. 
&quot;Why did you kill them!&quot; I screamed at her, my body trembling.

Mar&#39;s eyes widened slightly and drew her hand up suddenly,

&quot;Fire Soul!&quot; More flames shot out.

I braced myself, bringing my arms up waiting to feel the heat engulf me. 
However, only a few ashes lightly warmed my skin.

&quot;AHHHH!&quot; A man cried out.

I pivoted on the spot to see a burning corpse sink to the ground. That 
as it!

&quot;Yah!&quot; In blind rage I brought the chain back to life, its snaking 
movements danced and caught a weakened Mars in its hold. The woman was 
captured and suspended slightly above the ground in mid-air.

&quot;G-Geh...&quot; Mars gasped. With her arms had been pinned to their sides she 
chose to lash against her bonds by kicking her legs out. It was 
absolutely futile. &quot;What are you...&quot; She started to accuse but stopped 
short. The moment of humanity caught me off guard.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t I be asking you that?&quot; I angrily hissed, feeling the emotions 
well up again. She had betrayed me, us...the kingdom. After all we had 
been through, the promise before the mission, her love-was it all a lie? 
All for nothing?

&quot;Snap out of it Venus!&quot; Mars desperately called to me.

Souls...

&quot;What?&quot; I questioned. A strange voice filled the atmosphere of the area.

&quot;You&#39;ve got to let me go!&quot; Mars struggled again against her binds.

More souls...

A dark I cloud accumulated over the ground before sharply zigging and 
zagging along the ground, bright red eyes in its center gleaming. I 
froze; my body and my mind watched helplessly as it gained distance. It 
made contact with the reinforcement soldiers rushing towards it and I 
watched the grown men all stop dead in their tracks. Many gripped their 
heads and yelled at the top of their lungs before swiftly turning on one 
another. Clashes of spears and swords rang in the air, their eyes hollow 
and...soulless.


Give me...your soul!

The youma bee-lined towards me. Still frozen my body involuntarily 
trembled at the fear that had taken me.

&quot;Venus!&quot;

It all happened so fast yet so slow, each motion playing slowing in my 
eyes. Mars was yelling my name and the chain that I gripped so tightly 
yanked my body back. I was falling towards the ground. Slowly my head 
fell back in the fluid motion and I could finally see what had done it; 
Mars had jammed the back heel of her sailor footgear into one of the 
chain holes and roundhouse kicked backwards.

Realization had struck me as the cloud shot over me, slicing through the 
air towards the senshi of fire who was still suspended mid-air helpless. 
I watched horrified as the mass of negative energy engulfed the woman, 
her screams pierced my ears just as I hit the ground with a thud.

&quot;MARS!&quot; I screamed.

End dream

Briiiiiiiiing

My eyes shot open and I again found myself in my apartment room. Tears 
were running down my cheeks, staining as the rivers marked their trails. 
It was too real. I was there...

&quot;A-And I...&quot; I felt my breathing hitch, unable to speak the words that 
threatened to shatter my being.

Briiiiiiiiing

After taking in large gulps of air I finally realized the telephone was 
ringing. Still slightly trembling I shoved my legs over the side of the 
bed and took shaky steps out of my room and into the dark living room. 
Cautious not to wake my mom I quickly picked up the loud device. There 
was an odd silence at the other end of the line for a moment before a 
loud ecstatic voice boomed,

&quot;Hey! Hope I didn&#39;t wake you!&quot;

&quot;Shhh!&quot; I hushed the speaker, whoever it was they were ten volumes too 
loud. &quot;Who is this?&quot; I whispered.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you forgot me already.&quot; A disappointed, recognizable 
pouting voice whined.

&quot;Look this isn&#39;t a good time Manuke.&quot; Entirely truthful, I was feeling 
sick right to my stomach.

&quot;Gomen ne, but I had to tell you, we&#39;ve got a concert lined up for you 
n&#39; your &#39;friend&#39;...&quot; I listened intently, feeling my eyes go wide at the 
last bit.

&quot;IN TWO DAYS!&quot; I screamed.
