<p><u>“<em>Pride &amp; Prejudice: Tales from the grid-iron – vi.”</em></u></p>
<p><em>Even  before they slipped into the cab, the driver seemed like he began  suffering a seizure. Concern touched Minako’s features. She had asked  if he were all right. His reply was a sloppy, spit riddled,</em></p>
<p><em>“a...a...Aino...M-m-minako-chan!”</em></p>
<p><em>Her  cab mate scoffed, muttering something incomprehensible under her breath  before she had eased forth and whispered to him. As Rei did that, the  divide that nestled between them, had disappeared, her bubble of  personal space was invaded. Not that she minded... The Singer could  feel the fresh heat of Rei’s flesh – it enveloped her.</em></p>
<p><em>The  priestess righted herself, casting a fleeting glance to Minako. Her  eyes touched the Singer physically – sending Minako’s insides reeling  by just her gaze. Whatever was said to quell the driver, the Singer  never knew. Rei had grabbed the door handle and lifted it open –  expectantly waiting for Minako to comply.</em></p>
<p><em>“...What. Is there a certain ritual to have you move? Get in,” said Rei – tersely. “Don’t expect me to start calling you ma’am.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m not that incapable – I know how to open my own doors,” snapped Minako who had, since regained her sense of self.</em></p>
<p><em>Rei’s  eyes roamed Minako’s form freely resting at her elegant digits. “Not if  you have a manicure like that.” The miko’s muddy colored eyes flicked  upward catching the Singer’s gaze, “Two-hundred, Three maybe?”</em></p>
<p><em>Minako  didn’t flinch, never having had to back down in her life. But neither  did she acknowledge the cost of something as meager as her nails. She  finally settled in the cab. Rei shut the door and coursed her way on  the opposite end. The driver – Ishikawa-san, as she was told later –  had become a stark mute, the occasional unbelieving glance was still  proffered though. That couldn’t be helped, as Minako knew. Her  celebrity was still beyond her comprehension.</em></p>
<p><em>The cab ride  to the park berthed an almost uneasy ambiance. The tension was  palpable. She would rather have had Rei storming at her than the quiet.</em></p>
<p><em>“For civility’s sake...”, began the Star, “How have you been...”</em></p>
<p><em>“Just.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Just what? No one is ever just, Rei.”</em></p>
<p><em>Her  name tasted strange, yet comfortable on her tongue, but the familiarity  of it never went away for Minako. It was like a taste of your favorite  dish, one that you haven’t had for a very long time. It was a  homecoming. But Rei, was making it difficult.</em></p>
<p><em>“Just...good.”</em></p>
<p><em>Minako  had sighed. She couldn’t grasp why Rei was continuing to stonewall her.  The Singer wasn’t about to let Rei slide...not in this life.</em></p>
<p><em>“Why didn’t you call me?”</em></p>
<p><em>“...as if I had access to land lines in those remote places.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Then why not write? It would have gotten to me eventually.”</em></p>
<p><em>The  cab jostled to a halt, they had reached their destination; with a  glance out the windows, Minako saw the group frolicking at the Park.  Rei had seen them too; the miko seemed to be concentrating on one  thing...no...make that someone; was it Terry? Slowly, she turned  meeting Minako’s gaze – her eyes seemed hollow, devoid of the usual  fire the Star knew the exotic woman was capable of. She answered  quietly,</em></p>
<p><em>“...had you given me a reason to, Minako...the letters would have never stopped.”</em></p>
<p>--</p>
<p><em>‘...given me a reason to...’</em></p>
<p>Rei’s  words echoed in the icon’s mind. She couldn’t stop thinking about it.  As cryptic as they were, the way it was delivered crushed Minako. And  now she sat amongst friends, reveling in what the day had given them  and she couldn’t bring herself to enjoy it, the conversation had  centered about when Motoki and Makoto were going to FINALLY marry, and  if Ami...was a closet fetishist – How that particular topic came about,  Minako hadn’t the faintest. But it was Mako who had inferred having  caught the Doctor sporting Fishnet Stockings to work, that may’ve been  the ignition it needed.</p>
<p>Gruff lips nipped gently at the junction  of her shoulder and neck, her attentions were drawn to her lover, who  had not once let Minako leave his side. Not even when she had gone to  acquisition second helpings. His possessive onslaughts had heightened  today, and for Minako there was no rhyme or reason – Terry continued  placing chaste kisses along her neck, normally the Singer would have  silently asked her lover to stop, but.... She only knew one thing...she  inwardly wished those lips were softer and if she pretended...she could  almost have her wish come true.</p>
<p>...As her eye-lids went half  lidded the only one in her view, had been Rei; the raven-haired beauty  sat in repose, her lips twisted into a smile – someone had said  something funny because it was soon coupled with Rei’s musical  laughter. What she would have given to have the priestess laugh and  smile to her in that miko crawled under Minako’s skin. Rei infuriated  the Singer – keeping herself purposely out of the icon’s reach. And  there she sat, comfortably with the others while she stewed in envy.</p>
<p>And Minako hated to lose without knowing why.</p>
<p>It only made Minako more determined to break through those walls.</p>
<p>Dazed  and confused, Minako had enough wit about her to tear from Terry who  had gratefully ceased he began to joke with Motoki. While she, sat  there shaking within her skin. Terry was...is...her lover, he had  nothing but been exceptional, patient, loving – a virtual Saint...But  in Rei, her <u>friend</u> – she was being tortured emotionally; she  had been nothing but antagonistic towards the Singer and accusatory  since her arrival...yet, the instant Rei dropped her walls...the  instant she let her vulnerabilities show, Minako wanted to be the one  to wipe her fears and solitude from in her.</p>
<p>A water bottle had been lobbed onto her thighs – breaking the reverie. She looked up. “...rei...” her mouth was parched.</p>
<p>The  miko stood there, hovering over Minako’s prone form. She had been  eyeing the icon from across the way intermittently. It sickened her at  how Terry and she had no shame in how they went on just a little while  ago. Sickened? No. Angered...angered, because she never stood or WILL  stand a chance. Nursing her own drink, Rei motioned towards the bottle  with a nod of her head.</p>
<p>“I thought you needed a little something  to cool yourself down, Aino,” her voice remained detached trying to  mask that little splash of pain beneath the layers she wore.  Surprisingly to Rei, her voice didn’t betray her. Perhaps she sounded  more unforgiving than she needed to be, for Minako looked as if she  were just winded.</p>
<p>Terry – who remained sitting cross-legged next  to the Idol lifted his gaze towards priestess; the woman wore her  emotions on her sleeve – at least this is how Terry perceived. So it  was easy to goad her. Friction between he and Rei had been set even  before they laid their respective eyes on one another. He never knew  what type of friendship Minako had with that woman in the past – but  he’ll make damned sure it’ll stay where it is...in the past.</p>
<p>“Liked  watchin’ Rei? Could give you somethin’ more if you’re itchin’...,”  tested Terry as the thick of his fingers trailed over Minako’s lower  back.</p>
<p>Minako was horrified.</p>
<p>Rei smirked. Taking another  swig of her drink, she paused. Her brows furrowed. Suddenly, she began  sniffing the winter air, pronouncing, “I thought I smelled a dog. I  hope, for your sake he’s neutered, Minako – otherwise he’ll fuck up  your little fantasy island...”</p>
<p>The Football player lithely darted  to his feet eyeing Rei and the latter remained rooted in place. Minako  who was just as quick if not quicker than he, immediately wedged  herself between her hot-tempered lover with the fiery priestess at her  beck. The feel of Rei’s body was close enough to send Minako to her  knees; that was perhaps the closest she had been with the miko. Terry’s  countenance relaxed suddenly – a broad smile forming over his lips. His  arm flexed outward, taking Minako’s hand in his, kissing the back of  it, gently.</p>
<p>“It’s cool, babe – nothing but a little friendly prod.”</p>
<p>Rei gave a stiff nod in affirmation.</p>
<p>Minako was unsure, but grudgingly stepped back.</p>
<p>Usagi  had been in the midst of feeding her babe as the commotion started,  Luna hidden at her side. Mamoru and Motoki were off dumping the refuse  returned witnessing the end of the confrontation; while both Ami and  Makoto had been at the ready.</p>
<p>“I think it’s time to play some ball,” offered Makoto – obviously trying to break the tension.</p>
<p>Everyone  seemed to have accepted the suggested idea. The tall American eased  himself to snatch the nerf ball that was nestled atop ChibiUsa’s diaper  bag. He toyed with the soft ball, eyeing the group and in particular,  Rei. All before taking Motoki aside...</p>
<p>Erstwhile having slipped  herself from the main body of the group and a good ways away from the  Football star, Rei shed her outer coverings – tucking them aside onto  her luggage (since, she had just come from the Airport). She knew full  well that her jacket would not only trap the heat from her body, but  also be a hindrance when they played. As she tucked her wear aside, a  shadow was cast from behind her. Glancing briefly over her shoulder,  “Ami”, she acknowledged simply.</p>
<p>The diminutive doctor had brandished a smile.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan...Terry-chan isn’t a bad person.”</p>
<p>The miko tensed at the affectionate terminology that the women seemed to have adopted for the American.</p>
<p>“That’s nice for him.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you be happy for her?” murmured Ami, “They...really...care for one another.” She had to choose her words carefully.</p>
<p>The  doctor knew she was treading on dangerous ground. It wasn’t as if Rei  could hide it even if she thought she had, the only really BLIND  person, was the object of the miko’s affections. As an outsider  watching in, Ami, Usagi and Makoto had watched Rei and Minako’s  friendship deepen – they had a connection that sometimes, Ami wished  she had attained a few of the others. Rei didn’t admit it to anyone –  she didn’t have to. Her longing eyes and attitude of brashness today  conveyed everything she tried to run from.</p>
<p>This was Ami’s  profession, to notice. Behavioral psychology in children was no  different than those for the adults. The basic needs for the human race  were the holy trinity for its survival – food, shelter...and  companionship.</p>
<p>Rei spirited about and offered a trying smile,  “I’ll be throwing a party just for them.” As she passed the senshi of  wisdom, she paused in her trek before looking back to her from over her  shoulder, Ami knows. “Don’t ask me to be or DO anything I’m with,  please Ami,” murmured the woman. She hadn’t bothered to wait for Ami’s  reply.</p>
<p>Making her way towards the pitch, Rei was greeted with a haughty two-fingered salute and a wink from Terry Lapps.</p>
<p>High noon just hit.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>He  had been paid. He should have left. But he didn’t want to. A tendril of  smoke spiraled from the butt of his Marlboro brand cigarette. Wild  cheers erupted from the playing field, just a few yards from a picnic  table he sat at. His weathered face cracked into a Cheshire, lascivious  smile.</p>
<p>His Fiery Angel just scored.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The girls were  in a state of euphoric bliss. They had closed the point spread to  within a touchdown. Thanks in major part by Rei’s light of foot  quickness of which she used to easily evade Terry’s motions to block  her. Minako hadn’t had fun like this since that day Rei manipulated her  onto this ‘Battle of the Idols’ variety show. It was more than she  could say about her beau. She knew he had deliberately pitted himself  against the miko – he was never able to let a grudge drop.</p>
<p>Just  for that...the Singer let him stew in his own ego-ridden-concoction.  Her eyes danced towards the lithe priestess, one of just many stolen  glances. Rei had been celebrating with Makoto and hadn’t noticed the  Singer was observing everything she did. Thank God for that. Steeling  herself, Minako joined her teammates.</p>
<p>“...Do you think you can pull that off again?” her voice sounded strange to her, clung with a breathless inquiry.</p>
<p>Rei chuckled, affording a glance to a very disgruntled American.</p>
<p>“If  your gaijin boyfriend continues to perform like this –Then,  definitely,” the miko afforded a kittenish smile towards Minako. She  was met with a cant of the Singer’s head, and a hooded gaze. Smoldering  eyes threatened to swallow the miko, if she hadn’t looked away. “I  thought he knew how to play this game.”</p>
<p>Minako’s eyes flickered  with an inner laugh before a tug at the corners of her lips turned into  a mirthful smile. She moved herself closer to the miko whispering,  “Play nice, his feelings would be hurt if he knew he’s not perfect.”  The Singer didn’t care what she was saying – it was an excuse to be  near her, to be able to smell her and feel her. Rei let her guard down  just enough so that she could approach. An instantaneous fire was soon  born into Minako’s womb. She was flirting with her best friend. And  this...excited her.</p>
<p>“You of all people,” murmured Rei in return, “..know that I’m not very nice.”</p>
<p>“That’s not how I remember you...”</p>
<p>Makoto  cleared her throat breaking the spell between the two women. Rei  hurtled the spongy oblong ball towards the tall quarterback, leaving  Minako in her wake. The miko settled at the line of scrimmage. But the  faint breathless words that Minako said clung to her bared neck. What  the HELL was she doing?? Torturing her with the hint of Nirvana. All  the while her boyfriend hunkered just across the way....</p>
<p>...Seething.  That’s what Terry was. His game. Hig girl. And he was being bested. By  some dykie, smart mouthed, wannabe. His fingers dug into the sodden  earth. Terry saw them. They way they looked at one another. It was the  way he had always wanted Minako to look at him. It was only three on  three. Ami and Usagi had opted to play cheerleader along the sidelines,  and that only left Minako, Makoto and her. Terry will admit they were  athletic and gave the guys a run for their yen. Tensing his muscles,  adrenaline began to surge through his three-point stance. The ball had  been snapped. And Rei was a half a step out of synch.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Everything  moved in cinematic fashion – purposely and dramatically slow. As she  was expected to do, the raven-haired woman feinted to her left before  tapping into that speed she had relied on throughout the game. But she  was distracted and damned him if he didn’t know. Terry was already onto  her like white on rice. The ball was loosed – not in her direction. It  coasted, as it should have nestling into Minako’s hands. The play was  picture perfect, save for the supporting acts. The American lurched  forward letting his foot sweep at Rei’s. It was enough to trip the miko  before he more than just reached out and touched her. The next thing  she felt was her body wracked with a blunt force impact.</p>
<p>Time went normal again as her body careened into the earth. A sickening crunch was heard before a harshly spat,</p>
<p>“Bang, bitch. You been OWNED.”</p>
<p>Her  insides had reached a boiling point. She felt her hands grow feverish.  A soft ethereal glow began to permeate about her hands, even as her  body still fought to regain focus. Rei’s rage knew no boundaries – she  knew where and who her target was. Terry burrowed his eyes unto the  senshi of fire, daring her to retaliate. But she had no chance to as  the rest of the playing group trickled towards the bristling pair.</p>
<p>“What...what happened?,” questioned Motoki, “Are you okay Rei-chan?”</p>
<p>Terry  smirked, explaining, “Our legs got tangled.” He then had the audacity  to lean forth offering a hand, “That was some fall Rei...”</p>
<p>“you fucking....”, hissed Rei.</p>
<p>“The  operative word for the game is touch football, Terry!” interjected  Minako heatedly. Her eyes skimmed towards Rei, silencing her with a  simple glare.</p>
<p>“C’mon baby – I already told Motoki it was an accident.”</p>
<p>“I  don’t care...” Minako pulled herself closer towards her lover,  “...We’ll talk about this later, just...Don’t go near her for the rest  of the day...please.”</p>
<p>Raising his hands to either side of his  form, the Football player rolled his shoulders indicative of a shrug,  suddenly the taste of his personal victory was bittersweet. Mamoru and  Motoki tailed after the uppity American.</p>
<p>“It’s sprained...I think,” announced Makoto.</p>
<p>“Get on her other side, Makoto...”</p>
<p>“I can walk, it’s just a sprain.”</p>
<p>“All the more reason not to aggravate it more, fool.”</p>
<p>Minako  tucked herself against Rei’s form once they righted the raven-haired  miko. The Singer managed to stifle an errant shudder from the contact.  So much for the first touch...They eased the hot-tempered senshi at the  nearest stone picnic table. Rei had gone silent, watching the icon  loosen her footwear.</p>
<p>“Could you get a bandage and some ice Makoto? Thanks...”</p>
<p>The tall brunette glanced warily from Rei to Minako then towards the rest of the group – they were a few yards from the rest.</p>
<p>“Makoto?”  questioned Minako before offering a genial chuckle, “Don’t worry –  we’re not about to kill each other. We like each other at least a  little.. Ne, Rei?”</p>
<p>Rei managed a weak smile, “Somewhat.”</p>
<p>“H-hai...be back in a short while then.”</p>
<p>Kino  Makoto may be good at SOME things but she is most certainly much  smarter than many give her credit for. Well – incredibly intuitive. And  it was plain to her that at that tick of the second hand of time, no  one existed except for Rei and Minako.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The cigarette  singed his calloused fingertips, forcing him to drop the nub. He  snuffed out its life with the pads of his loafers. His eyes coursed  towards the tall black man. He did not appreciate what happened to his  Angel.</p>
<p>No one owned her.</p>
<p>At least....</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>“Will you stop squirming...”</p>
<p>“It <em>hurts</em>!”</p>
<p>Feathery soft fingers swam over Rei’s calf and swollen ankle. Minako’s brows had knit into worry.</p>
<p>“I don’t like that.”</p>
<p>She glanced upward.</p>
<p>Rei  didn’t realize how long she was staring at Minako, nor that her body  had moved forward. Her hand had reached out, pushing back Minako’s  colored bangs from obscuring the Star’s cocoa eyes. As if she had  suddenly snapped to reality, Rei’s thumb pressed between Minako’s  brows, breaking the awkward spell of intimacy.</p>
<p>“That, the wrinkle – I’ve heard that Stars aren’t allowed to grow old.”</p>
<p>Minako laughed, absently smacking Rei’s injury. Sending a sharp pain into her nervous system. Minako’s eyes grew wide.</p>
<p>“Rei...oh god I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>“Minako!  Is this the bedside treatment Terry gets when he’s hurt? It’s a wonder  he’s standing upright at all...” a throaty chuckle escaped Rei’s lips,  “Had I a little more time with him...he would be more than JUST black  now....”</p>
<p>“Look, I’ll talk to Terry tonight – he  gets...overzealous, I’m sorry for what happened, but..let’s just drop  that for now. We have to worry about you.”</p>
<p>“Worry? There’s nothing to worry about. I’ve always cared for myself.”</p>
<p>Minako’s jaw set, “GOD...you’re <em>impossible</em>. You think that’s only <em>sprain</em>, Hino?”</p>
<p>“I’m  sure you’ll enlighten me soon enough,” shrugged Rei, “Since...you know  it all. Global Star, turned Doctor. Nice...what’s the prognosis, doc?”</p>
<p>“No wonder you’re alone...no one has the endurance to continue to argue with you”, muttered Minako.</p>
<p>Rei inhaled slowly, forgetting the pain of her foot and suddenly concentrating on quelling the pain that settled in her heart.</p>
<p>“Who said anything about me being alone?” lied Rei, “I’m not the little girl you knew Aino. Don’t you ever presume to know me.”</p>
<p>“I’m...sorry,”  offered Minako quickly, “You...have...You’re with someone?”, rasped  Minako. Clearing her throat the Star lowered her gaze continuing to  administer to Rei’s ankle. Beyond sense, Minako was shocked. Maybe even  hurt at the sudden announcement..</p>
<p>“What. Do you think I’m incapable of being as happy as you and Terry-kins are?”</p>
<p>“I  didn’t mean it that way,” softly replied a pained Minako, “Who...who is  he?” Curiosity had gotten the better of her. She had to know.</p>
<p>Rei’s  mind worked furiously – she had to think of someone that was believable  enough for Minako to chew on. Granted she’s had a few port of calls in  her lifetime, but nothing serious. The little white lie may as well be  her downfall. Then...memories of her teenaged years spiked into her  mind. There was her answer, staring right in front of her face...Her  eyes looked upon the knelt beauty.</p>
<p>“You don’t know her...But both of you share the same love for music.”</p>
<p>The Singer raised her eyes. “H...her?”</p>
<p>Rei was amused by Minako’s reaction. “Tell me you didn’t have an idea about me.”</p>
<p>“Well...I...no, maybe. I didn’t want to press. I hoped you’d’ve told me in time.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>“How long have you been...together?” the question seemed hesitant. Minako was afraid to hear it. But how could she not?</p>
<p>The  miko’s gaze remained on Minako, a touch of sadness pooled into her  soul. She had wished the following words were true, “...It feels like  forever.” She had been describing Minako herself, but the woman...never  knew.</p>
<p>Silence shrouded the pair. But it hadn’t lasted long as Ami, Usagi and Makoto appeared.</p>
<p>“Sorry it took so long, we couldn’t find the bandages...”</p>
<p>“Usagi was using it to wipe ChibiUsa’s drool, that’s why.”</p>
<p>“I thought I it was her diaper cloth...”, protested the young mother.</p>
<p>The  statement brought an easy laugh shared amongst the five women before  Minako took the washed bandage and began to bind the injury. Gently,  after the knot was tied, Minako stood and regarded the small group.</p>
<p>“I don’t have to be at the sound check all day tomorrow – Why don’t we have a girls only day off?</p>
<p>Ami,  Usagi and Makoto looked to one another and offered their apology in  turn, citing reasons as why they couldn’t or won’t be available to make  it. Rei sensed that those reasons though, were deliberate as Usagi  offered,</p>
<p>“But Rei-chan will be free, hai? She can be your companion for the day!” Too cheerfully blurted.</p>
<p>“...If you can stand an invalid tailing you, Minako – then...I suppose,” grudgingly acquiesced Rei.</p>
<p>A touch of a smile eeked over the Singer’s lips, “Good. Then you can tell me all about your girlfriend...”</p>
<p>The three joined in confused looks towards one another. Rei outed herself to Minako and...had a girlfriend?</p>
<p>“Girlfriend?,” echoed Ami.</p>
<p>Minako nodded somberly, “I didn’t catch her name though.” Her eyes drifted towards Rei.</p>
<p>Expectantly,  the girls turned their collective gazes on Rei, whose head was  conveniently lowered before she tendered out her reply, “Isabelle.  Isabelle Rose.”</p>
<p>Among the three, they knew that Rei had no  relationship of that sort; she had earlier confirmed it while they  chatted and ate. Minako had been too busy trying to subtlety fend Terry  off as she ogled Rei. It wasn’t a surprise that she hadn’t heard the  girls’ conversation.</p>
<p>Rei’s eyes met Ami’s and pleaded with her silently to go along with the lie.</p>
<p>“French...?” asked Minako.</p>
<p>The  miko gave a non-committal grunt. The subject was soon changed as the  women helped the handicapped woman towards their picnicking area. Ami  had tailed the group, scribbling on a piece of paper when Makoto poked  her head to peer at what the senshi of wisdom was doing.</p>
<p>“Word game?”</p>
<p>“Something like that...”, replied Ami.</p>
<p>Scratching  out the possibilities, the studious doctor gave a soft exalting remark.  Makoto, ever curious snatched the paper and read it softly to herself,  “Eros and Belle. You understand this?”</p>
<p>Ami nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>“Okay...and this has to do with? The made up story of Rei’s ‘girlfriend’?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”  Ami paused, searching the taller woman’s countenance and chuckled,  “Eros is the son of Aphrodite...making him...the God of Love. And in  French...Belle is another term for Beauty.”</p>
<p>Divine light had  poured unto Makoto then. “Love and Beauty...Minako’s senshi title. I’ll  be”, She paused, “Rei made all this up to what....?”</p>
<p>“From a  psychological standpoint – when a person carries a burden they feel a  need to confess in some way, I think...” thought Ami, “Rei was  practically confessing herself to Minako.”</p>
<p>“Or...” Makoto nodded  towards the direction of Terry and Minako. The latter of whom  throughout the day became dejected and irritable, “...To make Minako  jealous.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Usagi had joined the pair and said, “Why do they have to make it hard on themselves?”</p>
<p>“What?” pressed Makoto.</p>
<p>“Tell me you don’t see Mako-chan...their pride. When you find Love, it shouldn’t be this painful to go through.”</p>
<p>Truer  words had never fallen from such innocent lips. But as the sun waned on  the day – the three good friends weren’t the only ones that took notice  of the chemistry between the Singer and Priestess.</p>
