<h1>Love and Beauty (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Makoto stared down at the textbook, trying to concentrate on the math 
problem. Her eyes just could not seem to focus on the numbers. She 
sighed in exasperation, and closed the book.

&quot;Are you okay, Mako-chan?&quot; a concerned voice broke through Makoto&#39;s 
thoughts and she felt a warm hand slide over her own. She looked up to 
see blue eyes, concerned and a little teasing, watching her. 

Makoto broke away from the intense gaze and looked at her own hand, 
covered by Minako&#39;s well-manicured one. The blonde had begun to rub 
her thumb along Makoto&#39;s thumb. A little thrill ran up her spine and 
Makoto had to make an effort to pull herself together and her hand 
away.

&quot;Yes, I just don&#39;t think I can concentrate today.&quot; Mako-chan looked 
around the table, including everyone in her statement. &quot;I think I&#39;ll 
go home now and rest.&quot; She gathered up her notebooks and books, making 
a hasty pile that she scooped up as she stood.

Ami looked up from her notebook, &quot;You do look tired, Mako-chan. We&#39;ve 
been studying hard and you need rest to study properly.&quot; 

Makoto nodded, &quot;Thanks Ami-chan.&quot; She smiled at everyone in turn, 
noting that Usagi had her mouthful and had to be content with waving. 
At this sight, Makoto&#39;s smile widened and she said goodbye.

Usagi could be heard to swallow audibly, then, &quot;Thank you so much for 
making the steamed buns! They&#39;re my favorite!&quot; 

Makoto turned around to wave and saw Minako staring intensely at her. 
She broke off the eye contact, and said lightly, &quot;I like making them 
for you, Usagi-chan.&quot; She turned again and slid the door aside. 

As she stepped out she heard Minako&#39;s voice follow her, &quot;Maybe you can 
teach me to cook them one day.&quot;

&quot;That would be nice,&quot; Makoto heard herself answer.

***********

The door slid closed. There was a moment of near silence, punctuated 
only by the cawing of crows, and Usagi chewing. Rei almost laughed out 
loud at the profundity of the moment. She looked across the table and 
locked eyes with Ami. Her friend&#39;s dark eyes had a peculiar glint to 
them, that Rei was sure she felt in her own eyes as well. &quot;What does 
it mean?&quot; Rei wondered. Just then Usagi pounced on Ami with a shriek, 
startling Rei out of her reverie. Rei turned to concentrate on her own 
studies and then looked up in surprise. Minako was sitting, still 
staring at the door that Makoto had passed through a moment earlier. 
Rei shook off a sense of....intensity and turned back to her studies.
