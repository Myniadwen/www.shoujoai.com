<h1>A Tired Heart's Desire (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/balticbard.html">Balticbard</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/tiredhart-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Somewhere, an eternity away, on the outter fringes of the universe, on 
a dark, barren, solemn, forgotten world, a once sullen, sombre soul now 
moved in pure ecstacy, and joy. 

Where once was sadness, trapped in the penumbral walls of a still human 
heart, was now filled with light, with the will to make a home of what 
was once her prison. 

What was once a frail, weeping soul trapped in a monstrous form, was 
now a graceful, lithe creature that floated along on an invisible 
breeze, created by the constant flapping of her butterfly wings, as she 
was surounded by her flowing, endlessly long, golden locks of blond 
hair. A toothy grin lit her beautiful face, as she surveyed the 
panorama that was her kingdom; a perpetually twilight world of velvet 
black skies, dimly lit by two moons, one crimson, the other a pastel 
orange. The ground was yellowish at times, or auburn, or black. A 
distant scene of inmense, dark mountains rose up against the violet 
sky. Sparse, white cumulus clouds dotted the sky now, and then, and a 
vast array of distant stars accompanied the two, gorgeous moons in 
lighting the constantly nocturnal sky. 

Mina&#39;s eyes glowed like diamonds, as she alighted upon the crest of one 
of the distant mountains that she had now made her home. What was once 
the senshi of love, and passion, had transformed from a grayish, many 
tentacled monster into a glorious, beautiful creature of enchantment; 
the beautiful, angelic-like, golden girl she had once been, but now 
with huge, multi-colored, butterfly wings. Now, in this strange, 
distant place, Mina was queen. 

The golden goddess had taken flight to survey her silent kingdom, and 
now she returned home, to the nest she had built, to the lover, and 
companion that waited for her, now trapped in the gentle arms of 
slumber. 

Mina landed softly, and her wings folded easily on her back, as she 
kneeled slowly next to her lover, to gaze upon the girl&#39;s sleeping 
form. 

Upon a plush blanket of exotic, multi-colored flowers, and newly born, 
thick, plush grass, lay in slumber, the miracle that had transformed 
the once bleak world, and it&#39;s sombre queen into things of beauty; a 
pale, voluptuous, stunningly beautiful girl with endlessly long, thick, 
wild raven hair, with full, ruby lips, and glowing sapphire eyes that 
awakened from sleep at her gorgeous lover&#39;s tender touch. 

&quot;Rei......my love,&quot; Mina whispered with fragile passion, as her gentle 
fingers caressed her lover&#39;s obsidian locks, &quot;Rei.....&quot; 

&quot;Yes....Mina....?&quot; came the velvet reply from moist, ruby lips that the 
golden queen loved to suck, and kiss in heated passion, and now spread 
into a soft smile. 

&quot;I love you so much, Rei.....&quot; the golden queen whispered back as she 
settled beside her ravishing senshi doll of fire, &quot;you brought me back 
to life,&quot; Mina said, with tears glistening in her blue eyes, as she 
wrapped her arms around Rei&#39;s curvaceous body, pulling her close, then 
kissing her in a passionate fervor, amid an increasing sexual vertigo, 
&quot;I&#39;m not alone anymore.....because of you.......&quot; 

&quot;Mina......we aren&#39;t really going to be the only two people on this 
planet.&quot; 

Mina suddenly started to laugh, at the same time she was kissing Rei, 
and she had the silliest idea just fly through her head, &quot;what....are 
we being invaded by aliens?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m pregnant.&quot; 

For several seconds, Mina&#39;s mind went blank. In any other circumstance, 
Mina would have thought that perhaps her lover had cheated, and that 
Rei was pregnant by some man.....but.....BUT....she knew with a 
certainty beyond all doubts that Rei would NEVER have done such a thing 
to her, surely as she would never have betrayed her Rei for ANYONE 
else. Then, there was the time element; Mina, and Rei had been on this 
new world for nearly a year now, and ALONE....so that pretty much 
summed up that the only other parent the child in Rei&#39;s womb could have 
was.... 

&quot;ME? MINE?&quot; 

Rei&#39;s full lips slowly spread, reaching out, forming dimples so perfect 
as to decorate the enchanting smile forming, as she displayed her 
perfectly shaped, small, pearly white teeth, &quot;I don&#39;t see anyone else 
around here, do you, Mina?&quot; 

&quot;But....Rei....we&#39;re both women.....how......?&quot; 

&quot;Who cares, Mina......is it important anyway?&quot; 

Mina smiled, as she rolled her lover over, then lay on top of her 
beautiful senshi doll, &quot;no, my love.....all that matters....is that its 
ours......&quot; 

Mina simply began to kiss her gorgeous lover, and to let herself be 
carried away on a wave of passionate arousal. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Epilogue.....

------------------------------------------------------------

It was just one more depressing day for Serena, who spent nearly all 
her time now at the lab, because it was where she felt closest to Rei&#39;s 
memories,&quot;two weeks, three days, five hours, twenty minutes.....that&#39;s 
how long Rei has been gone......how am I going to live without her?&quot; 
Serena thought sadly. Now, the beautiful, silvery blond princess spent 
most of her time reading the romance novels that Rei had loved so much. 
But one day, Amy walked into the library where Serena sat, reading. 

&quot;Serena, I have a surprise for you.&quot; 

&quot;You brought Rei back to me, Amy?&quot; 

&quot;Well......&quot; 

&quot;Then I&#39;m not interested, Amy.&quot; 

A determined Amy grabbed Serena by the hair, &quot;oh yes you are 
interested, Serena.....after ALL THE WORK I DID.....you better believe 
you are interested.....you are going to see your surprise RIGHT NOW!&quot; 

&quot;Amy.....LET ME GO!&quot; 

But Amy didn&#39;t let go of Serena&#39;s long, blond hair, with which she had 
zestfully filled her small, pale fists, and now proceeded to drag her 
princess along in the most indignant manner imaginable. The two girls 
struggled fiercely, as they passed a newly arrived Darian, and Lita. 

&quot;More theatrics, don&#39;t you think, Lita, darling?&quot; 

&quot;Oh yes, Darian, dear.....the children are never still.&quot; 

&quot;Should we restrain them, Lita?&quot; 

&quot;Oh most certainly not, Darian. Let them express themselves. Its 
supposed to be healthy for them!&quot; 

&quot;So I suppose we should just continue planning your engagement party, 
Lita dear?&quot; 

&quot;Of course, Darian daaawwwwwwllllliiiiinnnnnggggggg,&quot; Lita dawled 
mockingly in response. 

Lita, and her boyfriend of two years, Ken, had just become formally 
engaged, and were going to announce it at a party that Darian was 
throwing for them. 

&quot;Your taste is SO exquisite, Darian.....you should have been a woman.&quot; 

&quot;Exactly what I keep telling myself, Lita.....I have the wrong 
plumbing.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, you would make a wonderful lesbian anyway, Darian.&quot; 

&quot;?&quot; 

&quot;Well.....you aren&#39;t going to tell me that if you were a woman you 
would be absolutely straight, Darian?&quot; 

&quot;Well.......I guess not.....I&#39;ve never thought of it that way......&quot; 

&quot;Then nothing is keeping you from being as much of a woman as you want 
to be, Darian! And you never know......I happen to like tall, dark, 
muscular women........&quot; 

&quot;Oh.....LITA.....YOU SEXY FLIRT!&quot; 

Meanwhile, Amy dragged a very angry Serena to the mini-lab where she 
conducted most of her experiments, quickly opened the door, and just 
rudely pushed her princess inside. 

Serena was speechless, as she stood more like a statue, than a being of 
flesh, and blood, staring at the unexpected sight before her eyes; a 
stunningly beautiful, voluptuous, raven-haired, dormant Sailor Mars 
lying on top of a small table, her gorgeous body covered in a white bed 
sheet. A flood of crystal tears poured from Serena&#39;s once pained blue 
eyes, and a cry of joy that would thunder through the halls of Amy&#39;s 
memory forever, was torn from Serena&#39;s young throat. Serena threw 
herself bodily onto Rei&#39;s sleeping form, &quot;you brought her back, 
Amy....YOU BROUGHT HER BACK!&quot; Serena got up, ran to Amy&#39;s side, and 
hugged her tightly, almost wailing as she did, &quot;I don&#39;t know how you 
did it, Amy.....I don&#39;t care.....but you did.....thank you.....thank 
you.....&quot; 

A blushing, embarrassed Amy stepped back from an enthusiastic Serena&#39;s 
arms, &quot;well.....Serena.....its not quite what you think.....&quot; 

&quot;Its REI, Amy....&quot; 

&quot;But not exactly YOUR Rei, Serena.&quot; 

&quot;Oooooohhhh.....she is MOST definitely MINE, Amy!&quot; 

&quot;Well.....Serena......&quot; 

&quot;Stop stuttering, Amy, and just tell Bunny how you did it, alright 
already, Amy!&quot; Darian exclaimed, as he stepped into the mini-lab. 

&quot;I found a way to open a portal to an alternate dimension, where we 
have alter egos that are exactly like us. The portal I opened was to a 
time-line where earth was devastated by a great evil, and Tuxedo Mask, 
and three of the Sailors were all dead. Only two were left; Rei, and 
Mina. I managed to rescue them from death by transfering them here to 
our world.&quot; 

Amy was so breathless, that she swooned into Darian&#39;s waiting arms. 

&quot;You are a great genius, Amy,&quot; Darian said with a smile, seeming 
suddenly very effeminate, as he cuddled the shortest of the Sailors, 
&quot;but you are so silly sometimes.&quot; 

&quot;So....this isn&#39;t my Rei....&quot; Serena said sadly. 

Suddenly, Rei, the sleeping beauty stirred, her curvaceous body movine, 
causing sensous folds in the sheet covering her. Rei&#39;s raven locks 
moved with her, falling around her gorgeous face, around her pale 
breasts, soft shoulders. Rei moaned softly, as velvety sighs escaped 
from her throat. Rei&#39;s eyes opened, as her thick, long, dark lashes 
fluttered several times, until her vision cleared, and her deep gaze 
fell on Serena. For what seemed an eternity, but was only a few 
seconds, Rei was silent, then she started to cry like a child, as sobs 
shook her slender form, &quot;.....Rena?&quot; Rei&#39;s voice was strangled, &quot;but 
you&#39;re dead.....I saw you die.....I wasn&#39;t able to save you....&quot; 

Serena&#39;s heart, filled with love, with passion, and desire, was moved 
with tenderness, and pity towards the woman she loved more than 
anything in her life, even if it was confusing that this was another 
Rei....it didn&#39;t matter; it was still Rei....HER Rei. Serena sat on the 
table, next to the crying girl, and hugged her tightly, &quot;don&#39;t cry, 
baby....its me....I&#39;m alive.....everything is just fine....&quot; Serena was 
no longer able to hold back her desire, as she tilted the girl&#39;s head 
towards her, and then kissed Rei, covering the girl&#39;s ruby lips with 
her own pink ones. 

&quot;Rena?&quot; a confused Rei managed to pull back for a second from Serena&#39;s 
hungry lips, &quot;but you said that you didn&#39;t love me that way......and it 
hurt me so much because I&#39;m in love with you.&quot; 

&quot;Um.....Rei.....I&#39;m not THAT Serena......your Serena was probably 
straight...and dead.....but I am VERY much alive, and a lesbian....and 
madly in love with you.&quot; 

&quot;Rena.....don&#39;t make me suffer anymore......&quot; Rei couldn&#39;t stop 
sobbing, &quot;I don&#39;t know what is going on.....this must all be some kind 
of hallucination.....I saw you die.......with Darian....&quot; 

&quot;Stop that!&quot; Darian cried, as he literally began to shiver, &quot;I am NOT 
DEAD.....well at least I&#39;m not....but that poor guy is.......so will 
you take her somewhere private and EXPLAIN the situation to her, 
Bunny?&quot; 

Rei almost fainted at the sight of a very much alive Darian. 

&quot;Rei,&quot; Serena helped Rei get up slowly from the table that she had been 
lying on, &quot;I&#39;ll explain everything....I have a room here in the 
lab....I&#39;m going to take you there, and we can talk.&quot; 

Rei nodded silently, as she got up from her bed, and gathered the sheet 
that covered her, up around herself, and let Serena&#39;s arms wrap 
themselves around her. Serena took the girl in her arms, and slowly, 
the two of them walked out of the mini-lab, and disappeared down the 
long hall, just as Lita walked into the mini-lab. 

&quot;Rei is still weak,&quot; Amy said worriedly, as she watched the princess, 
and the beautiful senshi of fire leave the mini-lab, I should follow 
them, and make sure that Serena doesn&#39;t try to......&quot; 

A huge, manly hand covered Amy&#39;s pink mouth, thus silencing her, 
preventing her from finishing her thought pattern, &quot;no....Amy,&quot; Darian 
said gravely, &quot;you aren&#39;t going anywhere. Rei can take care of 
herself.&quot; 

&quot;But.....&quot;Amy managed to say briefly, when she took Darian&#39;s hand from 
her mouth. 

Once more, Darian silenced Amy, but this time, he used his lips 
instead. Darian pulled the senshi of water quickly into his strong 
arms, and kissed the girl for quite a long time, as he held her fast, 
trapped within his powerful embrace. Darian could afford himself of 
kissing Amy for quite a long time, because he was breathing through his 
nose, but Amy wasn&#39;t so knowing of erotic ways, and was quickly 
struggling against the handsome hero, till she freed herself enough to 
breathe. 

&quot;Darian....ARE YOU TRYING TO ASPHYXIATE ME?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t you breathe though your nose when you kiss, Amy?&quot; 

&quot;No.....um......I.......&quot; 

&quot;Oh, my God.....&quot; Darian exclaimed, mockingly, in an exaggerated, 
effeminate manner, as he looked up at the newly arrived Lita, &quot;I can&#39;t 
BELIEVE it......Lita.....our little Amy IS STILL A VIRGIN!&quot; 

&quot;OH NO!&quot; Lita screamed in reply, also mockingly, laughing, &quot;there MUST 
be a cure for such a dreaded desease!&quot; 

&quot;Of course there is!&quot; Darian replied, with an evil grin on his handsome 
face, &quot;ME!&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Amy&#39;s dark eyes nearly popped out of her pretty head, 
&quot;no......wait.....hey......YOU&#39;RE GAY!&quot; 

&quot;Of course I am, Amy,&quot; Darian said with glowing eyes, as he took the 
girl into his muscular arms, lifting her easily up, and over his 
shoulder caveman style, &quot;I&#39;m a LESBIAN!&quot; 

&quot;PUT ME DOWN, DARIAN!&quot; Amy yelled at the top of her voice, &quot;put me 
DDDDOOOOOOWWWWNNNNN!&quot; 

Meanwhile, Lita laughed hysterically, as she watched Amy struggle, and 
cry out for help, while Darian walked down the hall with her, headed 
towards HIS room. 

Lita was laughing so hard, that she didn&#39;t notice a soft presence a few 
feet away, watching her in deep shock, and surprise. 

&quot;Lita? Is that you? Is it really you?&quot; 

Suddenly, Lita stopped laughing, because she recognized the voice that 
had spoken from behind her, &quot;Mina?&quot; Lita turned to find Mina standing a 
few feet away from her, and just like Rei, wrapped in a white bed 
sheet, &quot;I thought you were never coming back.....&quot; Lita stopped 
speaking, as she realized that this was &quot;ANOTHER&quot; Mina, not the one 
that Serena had sent away, not &quot;their&quot; Mina, &quot;I mean......you, and Rei 
are......&quot; Lita watched the look of surprise on Mina&#39;s face turn to one 
of utter confusion, &quot;no....our Rei, and Mina are gone for good.....&quot; 
Lita&#39;s eyes gazed sadly at the girl who stood before her; it was almost 
as if Mina had never left, it was the same golden-angelic vision of 
gentle beauty that her dear friend, the senshi of love had always been, 
&quot;you&#39;re exactly like her....its almost as if Mina never left.&quot; 

&quot;I AM NOT ANOTHER MINA! I AM MINA!&quot; 

Lita was startled by the beautiful blond&#39;s sudden, angry, fierce 
outburst, and a wave of guilt washed over her heart, as her beautiful 
face was drowned in a shadow, &quot;uh.....of course, Mina.....I&#39;m 
sorry.....I never meant to.....&quot; Lita was at a sudden loss for words, 
for a way to apologize for her callous comment, so she stepped back, 
then turned with the intention of leaving, &quot;I had better go.....&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Mina cried suddenly, &quot;Lita.....wait....PLEASE DON&#39;T GO!&quot; Mina&#39;s 
voice was a wail of pain, a plea torn from her bleeding heart. Mina&#39;s 
deep, blue gaze moved up, and down Lita&#39;s figure, as if trying to 
assure herself that this was really her friend. 

Tall, gorgeous, voluptuous Lita, with long, wild, wavy, golden-auburn 
hair that fell about her pale shoulders, her long, swan neck, and 
framed her exquisitely beautiful, fine-featured face, with big, 
glowing, emerald eyes, outlined with long, thick, raven lashes, with 
moist, full, ruby lips, with seemingly endless, curvaceous legs, tiny 
waist, with firm, round, supple breasts, with slender arms, with pale, 
graceful hands; unbelievably feminine, beautiful Lita dressed in a 
tight, short, black dress that seemed to have been poured onto her as a 
thick, clinging, dark liquid that outlined her exquisite curves, was 
the EXACT opposite of the woman that had been Mina&#39;s lover in her own 
world. 

The Lita that Mina had loved was tall, lean, well muscled, masculine, 
with short, dark-brown hair, with piercing, green eyes, with strong, 
callused hands, and always dressed in men&#39;s clothes. 

The Lita that Mina had once called her lover was a strong, agressive, 
possesive, jealous, determined woman; brave, brash, violent at times, 
dominating the beautiful, blond senshi of love in bed, and everyday 
life. 

Now, an awe-struck, confused Mina tried to understand, to somehow 
believe that this wondrous sight before her actually existed; a 
stunningly beautiful, feminine, curvaceous Lita. Mina shook her head, 
trying to understand, but couldn&#39;t. There was only one answer; her Lita 
was gone forever. Her world was also gone. In this place she really was 
&quot;another&quot; Mina, and not the original one that this vision of beauty had 
known as the goddess of love. But Mina drowned out her turmoil, her 
sadness, as she spoke to her heart in a voice of hope; yes, the Lita 
she had known was gone, but still Lita was here, this Lita, who 
suddenly filled the blond senshi of love with longing, with desire, 
with deep lust. 

Lita, on the other hand, was getting extremely nervous, uneasy at the 
lustful, hungry stares that Mina was giving her, and had discreetly 
stepped back several feet, and was about to leave, &quot;I have to go.....my 
boyfriend, Ken is waiting for me....&quot; the tall beauty said, stressing 
the word &quot;boyfriend,&quot; with particular force. But suddenly, Lita&#39;s 
concentration was broken, when the cellphone in her purse began to ring 
insistently, urgently. Lita delicately opened her purse, took out the 
cellphone with her long, elegant, slender fingers, and placed it next 
to her ear. 

Mina watched in pure rapturous wonder, every one of Lita&#39;s moves, and 
gestures. Mina shook her head slightly; &quot;it feels so strange,&quot; the 
senshi of love said to herself, &quot;Lita is so feminine.....so 
delicate......but I think that I can get used to this.....to her....&quot; 
Mina was smiling now, as the sadness, and the dark memories of the past 
seemed to fade away, as her cerulean gaze moved up, and down the figure 
of the senshi of thunder, who stood before her, completely absorbed in 
a conversation on her cellphone, &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter.....this is still 
Lita.....MY Lita......and I don&#39;t care how many times she screams 
&quot;boyfriend&quot; in my face......I won&#39;t let her go....I&#39;ll chase her till 
she drops...&quot; now, Mina was truly smiling, more of a toothy grin, as 
her heart fluttered, as her skin broke out in an endless sea of 
goosebumps, and a delightful tingling began to form between her legs, 
&quot;after all I am the goddess of love.....I&#39;ll just zap her with my most 
powerful love spell, and she won&#39;t even look at another man for the 
rest of OUR lives......&quot; now, Mina was absolutely beaming, &quot;I&#39;m getting 
her into bed in about five minutes.&quot; 

Meanwhile, Lita was enveloped in her own world, as she spoke to her 
handsome lover, who was on the other sideof the cellphone, and Mina was 
quietly watching her. 

&quot;Ken....Darling,&quot; Lita&#39;s vioce was playful, seductive, and it seemed to 
tickle Mina&#39;s insides, so that she began to tremble, &quot;yes, Ken....but 
what is it?&quot; although, Mina couldn&#39;t hear Ken&#39;s voice, she didn&#39;t want 
to, and didn&#39;t care, because the goddess of love was riding a wave of 
sheer pleasure, caused by the velvety notes of Lita&#39;s sultry voice. But 
Mina was awakened from her erotic revelry, when she noticed Lita&#39;s 
stance change from one of erotic, languid ease, to a sudden stiffening 
of her voluptuous body, as even the face of the senshi of thunder 
showed sudden anger, &quot;What do you mean the engagement is OFF, Ken 
Mathews?&quot; Lita&#39;s voice was rising in timbre, making it forceful, as her 
demeanor then changed to rage, to reddened, sculpted cheeks, &quot;how can 
you do this to me, you BASTARD?&quot; Mina was shocked at the force in 
Lita&#39;s voice, at how her full lips trembled in rage, at how her auburn 
mane swept suddenly off her ivory shoulders, &quot;what do you mean I&#39;m 
PUSHY? How DARE you say that I&#39;m too BUTCH!&quot; Lita&#39;s once calm brow was 
furrowed in lines of rage, turning her once serene face into a valley 
of destruction, &quot;I swear, Ken......right now I really could KILL YOU 
WITH MY BARE HANDS!&quot; Mina&#39;s heart jumped with joy, because now Lita was 
free, &quot;oh, like I would ever marry a COWARD like you, Ken!&quot; Lita 
screamed into the cellphone. At that moment, a very aroused Mina was 
suddenly reminded of the other Lita&#39;s quick, forceful temper, &quot;they are 
so alike deep inside,&quot; Mina said to herself. 

&quot;Well you started this argument, Ken Mathews, and I am going to finish 
it!&quot; Lita&#39;s ire had grown to gigantic proportions now, &quot;you are the 
WORST lover that I have EVER known, and I have had a few more than I 
ever told you.....and you can&#39;t even get that STUPID excuse for a PENIS 
to work half the time anyway! What? I&#39;M being offensive NOW? Half the 
time I had to BITE my lip to keep from LAUGHING! THAT&#39;S how bad of a 
lover you are, Ken,&quot; Lita was now leaning against the wall, thick, 
crystal tears were running from her glowing, green eyes, as she tried 
desperately to keep her voice even so that not even a whimper escaped 
her lips, &quot;NO! Now I&#39;M the one who&#39;s turning YOU down! GO TO HELL, YOU 
BASTARD!&quot; then, Lita literally crushed the cellphone in her trembling 
fingers, as Mina suddenly felt the wild urge to laugh, and applaud. 

Lita was sobbing now, because not only had her pride been hurt, her 
heart was shattered into a million pieces. Lita had been deeply in love 
with Ken, and he had suddenly abandoned her, like so many of her 
lovers; all had just turned their backs on her, without reason, without 
pity for her. Lita was just sick, and tired of men in general, and just 
sick of being alive. For once, Lita wished that she wasn&#39;t immortal. 

Thick tears ran down Lita&#39;s smooth, pink cheeks, down her fine nose, 
and outlining her full lips. Mina was no longer able to hold back her 
desire, as she rushed forward, and latched onto the beautiful senshi of 
thunder, &quot;oh....Lita, please don&#39;t cry.....he didn&#39;t deserve 
you......you are too beautiful, to wonderful for him......but you 
aren&#39;t alone.....I love you.....I&#39;ll never, NEVER leave you.....I&#39;ll be 
with you forever! Please love me back, Lita.....please.&quot; Mina 
exclaimed, as she trembled, as she bared her passion, her love to the 
woman she loved, and desired desperately. 

&quot;But.....wait.....I&#39;m not a......I.....I&quot; Lita looked down, amid tears, 
and sniffles at the beautiful girl who had embraced her. Lita was about 
to reject the blond girl&#39;s advances, to tell Mina that she was 
straight, that she could never love her that WAY. But then, Lita&#39;s mind 
raced back to memories of all her other lovers, all men, all proud, all 
promising devotion, yet none had ever looked at her the way that Mina 
was now looking at her; with utter, deep, hopeless desire, need, and 
love. Lita shook her head, as she realized that if she turned Mina 
away, she would regret it for eternity, that she would never find 
another love so deep, so true as the one this girl offered her. So, 
Lita made the wise decision of keeping the beautiful, blond senshi 
forever. 

Lita looked down into hopeful, anxious blue eyes that crowned Mina&#39;s 
loving, beautiful face, and then she smiled, &quot;Yes, Mina....I love you 
back.....I won&#39;t ever leave you,&quot; Lita realized that she was forever 
the loving prisoner of this beautiful, gentle creature that she had in 
her arms. 

&quot;Lita......oh.....my God.....Lita....&quot; Mina whispered with fervor, as 
the golden goddess stood on her toes, as the gorgeous, tall senshi of 
thunder kicked off her high-heel pumps, and leaned down, deeper into 
pink, hungry lips of a lovesick goddess of love that sought out her own 
full, ruby lips, &quot;oh....Lita.....will you marry me?&quot; Mina&#39;s eager arms 
tightened around Lita&#39;s small waist, as Mina leaned deeper into her 
plush curves. 

&quot;Huh? You want to marry me? Really, Mina?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be seperated from you ever again, Lita!&quot; 

A slow, beautiful smile dawned upon Lita&#39;s full, red lips, as tears 
seemed to glisten in her emerald eyes, as she wound her arms around the 
her blond senshi&#39;s slender, warm body, drawing the lovesick girl deeper 
into the warm, voluptuousness of her beautiful body, &quot;yes, Mina, my 
love....I&#39;ll mary you,&quot; Lita lowered her head, her thick, auburn mane 
raining down like a mantle around her, around a trembling Mina, and she 
slowly kissed the blond senshi, sending the girl deeper into desire, 
arousing her to the point of desperation. 

&quot;Oh....Lita,&quot; Mina sighed, &quot;please....lets go to your room....or 
mine....now.....I need to make love to you!&quot; 

&quot;Well you already are naked, Mina,&quot; Lita replied, the sound of her 
musical laugh seeming to rise, and fall like a wanton ocean wave. 

&quot;Lita.....don&#39;t torture me.....please.....&quot; 

&quot;I guess the engagement party is still on,&quot; Lita said, as she walked 
out of the mini-lab, and down the hall slowly, because Mina was 
completely tangled in her body, &quot;my room is closer.&quot; 

At that very instant, an exhausted, sweaty, blond princess named Serena 
reached the twilight of the heavens, the peak of pleasure; Nirvana, as 
she exploded in orgasmic pleasure, as she ground herself into Rei&#39;s 
endlessly soft, warm, plush body, into her silken skin, into her 
gentle, slender arms. 

Serena sighed audibly, as she lay beside the queen of her heart, Rei, 
the goddess of fire, &quot;oh.....Rei.....I love you so much.....I thought I 
had lost you forever.&quot; 

&quot;I love you too, Rena.....forever.&quot; 

Suddenly, Amy&#39;s screams, and the sounds of her struggle frighten the 
two beautiful lovers, who quickly get up from the bed they were laying 
on, and still nude, they run to the door of the room, open, and look 
out. 

Serena, and Rei started laughing, when they saw a hopelessly, and now 
almost totally effeminate Darian walk by with a struggling, stubborn 
Amy thrown over his back. Darian set Amy down a little further down the 
hall, in front of the door to his room. Then Darian proceeded to take 
the angry senshi of water in his powerful arms, and kiss her almost to 
perdition. When Darian released Amy, she was smiling. Then Darian 
opened the door to his room, and led his beautiful, new lover inside. 

The sound of giggling, and soft murmurs came from down the hall, as 
both Lita, and Mina walked by, tangled in each other&#39;s arms, and 
stopped before the door to Lita&#39;s room. The two, young women began to 
kiss, as an impatient, desperate Mina opened the door, and pushed her 
gorgeous senshi of thunder inside, and then followed, closing the door 
behind her. 

Serena, and Rei looked at each other, and started to laugh once more, 
&quot;Amy told me that everything was going to be alright, Rei,&quot; Serena said 
with a smile. 

&quot;I guess it looks like a happy ending for everyone, Serena......&quot; 

&quot;For all of us, Rei.....for all of us.....&quot;
