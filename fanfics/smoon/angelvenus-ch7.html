<h1>Angel of Venus (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/angelvenus-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Wha? B-but Usagi!&quot; Mitsuki pleaded, running up to the blonde&#39;s side. 
&quot;Y-you can&#39;t leave me with the--I mean, alone! I mean...I mean! Can&#39;t 
you just...can&#39;t I go with you?&quot;

Usagi laughed and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry, Mitsuki! You can 
meet Mamo-chan another day though, okay? Don&#39;t worry, alright, I&#39;ll be 
back in a few hours! Minako said she was coming to pick you up too. You 
guys can hang out together while I&#39;m gone!&quot;

Mitsuki paled. &quot;M-Minako? I mean, I mean...by herself?&quot;

Usagi nodded. &quot;Uh huh! Minako&#39;s fun to hang out with! You didn&#39;t think 
it was going to be all of the girls, did you? Minako&#39;s the only one free 
today.&quot;

&quot;O-oh. Oh. Okay then. Um, enjoy your date with Mamoru.&quot;

&quot;I will! And you enjoy your night out with Minako, okay?&quot; Usagi frowned. 
&quot;Try to talk some, okay? She likes when people talk.&quot;

&quot;Right. I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll remember that.&quot;

&quot;Okay!&quot; Usagi called over her shoulder. She was already making her way 
out of the door. &quot;Have a blast!&quot;

Mitsuki slumped. &quot;Okay. I&#39;ll...try.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

It&#39;s the rain that I hear coming

Not a stranger or a ghost

It&#39;s the quiet eye of the storm approaching

That I fear the most

It&#39;s the rain that I hear coming, the slightest crystal tear

Drops to the ground in silence, when my love is near

-Delerium, Innocente


&quot;Oh no, oh no! It was bad enough when I thought that I was going to have 
to deal with all of them...but at least they would have distracted 
her...&quot; Mitsuki paced through Usagi&#39;s room, wringing her hands 
nervously. Luna gave her a quizzical look from her spot on Usagi&#39;s bed, 
but decided to wait and listen. Her behavior was very strange.

Odd girl, Luna thought. Why would she be worried about Minako? If she&#39;s 
hiding something, Rei&#39;s the one she should watch out for.

&quot;I...I...hmph.&quot; Mitsuki sat next to Luna on the bed and absentmindly 
scratched the cat behind her ears. &quot;What should I do, I wonder? I could 
leave,&quot; Luna&#39;s ears pricked up at this, &quot;but that would be really weird, 
wouldn&#39;t it? Besides, where would I go?&quot; She sighed. &quot;I guess...I know! 
I should concentrate. If I keep my mind on something else, I won&#39;t have 
to think about it!&quot;

Luna blinked. What in heaven&#39;s name is this strange girl going on about?

When the doorbell rang, Mitsuki jumped in surprise. Luna blinked again.

&quot;Oh, that must be her, I guess! I should go down there and go too...um, 
bye Luna!&quot;

Mitsuki stumbled out of Usagi&#39;s room, and down the stairs. Luna shook 
her head, and curled back up to sleep.

&quot;Strange girl...perhaps she&#39;s been spending too much time with Usagi,&quot; 
she muttered, closing her eyes.

-----------------

&quot;So, where do you want to hang out? The others are all off somewhere on 
the weekends. Makoto and Rei have dates, and well, you know about Usagi, 
and Ami&#39;s off...I don&#39;t know, doing something. Probably studying. I&#39;d 
visit, but she always gets weird when people interrupt her studying. So, 
what do you usually do on weekends?&quot; Minako said in one breath, turning 
to a baffled Mitsuki.

&quot;Oh, I...&quot; she tried to remember what she had done for fun on the 
weekends. &quot;I...it&#39;s been a long time since I really enjoyed anything.&quot; 
Mitsuki glanced down at her feet. &quot;I&#39;m not much help, I guess...&quot;

&quot;Oh no! Don&#39;t feel bad! Hey, how about we go over my house? Artemis is 
probably around, but he won&#39;t mind, being a cat. And my parents are at 
work. You&#39;ve never been at my house, right? Only to the shrine and 
Usagi&#39;s house, huh?&quot;

&quot;N-no. I&#39;m afraid I have--&quot;

&quot;Oh! I know what we can do! We can visit Setsuna and Hotaru! Knowing 
Haruka and Michiru, they&#39;re probably gone somewhere too, but I bet 
Setsuna is there. You&#39;ve never met them, right?&quot;

Mitsuki shook her head, sighing inwardly. At least this meant she would 
have someone else to serve as a buffer for Minako. &quot;I&#39;ve never met them. 
I&#39;d like to though.&quot;

&quot;Okay! But we&#39;ll only stay for a while. They&#39;re kinda um, quiet.&quot;

--------------

Setsuna quietly set tea for four, glancing over at Hotaru, who sat 
reading a book.

&quot;We&#39;re having guests.&quot; Hotaru perked up immediately.

&quot;Really? Oh, who?&quot;

&quot;Minako,&quot; Setsuna made a mental note to check if there was any aspirin 
in the medicine cabinets, &quot;And another young lady.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Minako? Another lady? Who is she?&quot;

Setsuna frowned and stared at the teacup in her hand. &quot;I&#39;m not exactly 
sure.&quot;

&quot;Not sure? Oh! It&#39;s one of those things you can&#39;t tell us, right?&quot;

&quot;Something like that...&quot; the older woman frowned and glanced out the 
window. &quot;You should go answer the door, Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;Alright!&quot;

---------------

&quot;Once again,&quot; Kazuki murmured, her voice crackling over the 
communication line, &quot;She requests that you do not send over your 
translation.&quot;

&quot;B-but! Kazuki! I spent such a long time breaking down their language! 
She can&#39;t be serious!&quot; Nioko protested.

Kazuki yawned. &quot;I&#39;m afraid so, Lady Nioko. Now, I must be going.&quot;

&quot;Wait one second Tall, Dark and Scary! I want to speak to her! I&#39;m tired 
of running around doing her errands, no? And then having her tell me 
&#39;the time isn&#39;t right,&#39; or something! I told her I&#39;ve got other things 
to worry about now!&quot;

Suejirou winced at Nioko&#39;s side and patted her shoulder. &quot;You must calm 
down. Realize who you&#39;re speaking to...&quot;

&quot;No! I don&#39;t know why she can&#39;t just tell them! I&#39;ve worked for royalty 
most of my life, but this is just ridiculous! At least Nami is 
reasonable!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not exactly royalty,&quot; Kazuki murmured over the line, &quot;however, I 
realize you might be angry with her. I&#39;ll see if I can reach her.&quot;

&quot;Hmph.&quot; Nioko frowned and leaned against her chair, rocking back and 
forth. &quot;This is tiring. They&#39;re in danger, you know? Nami and Ririko 
too, and she keeps making us wait. For what?&quot;

Suejirou leaned over and kissed her forehead. &quot;She&#39;s been very strange 
for a while Nioko, you know that. She&#39;s become...distant.&quot;

&quot;More than you?&quot; Nioko joked, pulling him down to nuzzle her head in the 
crook of his neck. &quot;I&#39;m worried though,&quot; she whispered. &quot;It&#39;s 
simply...bizarre, no? Honestly, the potential danger overrides whatever 
she&#39;s waiting for. Or is she waiting for the danger?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. She&#39;s told me and the others very little. Kazuki is the 
one who knows the most, and she doesn&#39;t even know everything. I 
am...worried, about her.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you should have gone to that Earth place too. You know Nami and 
Ririko don&#39;t get along all that well.&quot;

Suejirou stood up and shook his head, frowning. &quot;And deal with their 
bickering? No thank you.&quot; He glanced over at Nioko&#39;s communication 
device. &quot;It&#39;s blinking. She must be waiting for you to speak.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Um, hello.&quot;

&quot;Hello Nioko...You wished to speak to me?&quot;

&quot;Oh, um...yes. I was just wondering why you needed me to cancel the 
warning. I just...I just wanted to help, is all.&quot;

&quot;Nioko. Please understand. Nami and Ririko have been to the end and 
back. They have fought many battles, as have the Senshi. Whatever is 
thrown at them, they can handle. Everything must go according to plan.&quot;

&quot;But...but...&quot;

The woman sighed. &quot;I know Nami is your best friend, and that you love 
her. However, the Queen is not in any immediate danger, nor Ririko. The 
Senshi however...each day becomes more dangerous. We must wait, however. 
There is nothing to be done until then. I...I had no idea there would be 
Senshi involved...that makes things...do not worry, Nioko. I will make 
everything all right. I promise, I give you my word.&quot;

Nioko bit her lip. &quot;Okay...if you say so...&quot;

&quot;I know so.&quot;

----------------

Kazuki yawned and played with strands of loose hair as she watched 
events unfold on the screen. &quot;Your reassurance was...less than 
reassuring.&quot;

&quot;I know. It&#39;s the best I can do for now.&quot;

&quot;This woman...&quot; Kazuki murmured, watching Setsuna carefully. &quot;Something 
is strange about her.&quot;

&quot;Strange?&quot;

&quot;She set four cups on the table. One for her and the child, and two 
others. However, there was no phone call to inform her that they&#39;d be 
having guests.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot;

&quot;You see? How exactly would she know that the loud one was coming to 
visit her? She would have to be precognitive...oh.&quot;

&quot;You give them too little credit, Kazuki,&quot; the woman laughed. &quot;That 
lady, I think, has lived for a very long time. Knowing when guests 
arrive before they do is hardly a challenge for her.&quot;

Kazuki watched Setsuna&#39;s movements, watched her smooth down the child&#39;s 
hair, leaning over in the process. She raised an eyebrow. &quot;She certainly 
doesn&#39;t look as if she&#39;s lived for a long time. She fits right in with 
the others.&quot;

The woman sighed. &quot;You&#39;d be surprised.&quot; A pause. &quot;You yourself know how 
difficult it is fitting in with others younger than yourself, do you 
not? Imagine that age difference being increased a millenia-fold.&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot; Kazuki frowned. &quot;It was often very aggravating. Though, she 
seems...&quot;

&quot;Calm?&quot;

&quot;Yes, that. I would like to know her secret.&quot;

&quot;She is in the crowd, but not of it. She knows when things are 
happening, however, she pulls away, stays in the background. She 
distances herself.&quot;

&quot;A lonely existence. Even at Nami and Ririko&#39;s most...irritating 
moments, I did appreciate their friendship.&quot;

&quot;Would you like to meet her?&quot;

&quot;If you see it fit, I will speak to this woman. Though,&quot; Kazuki said, 
standing up, &quot;she probably already knows I&#39;ll be coming, doesn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;You might want to use the opportunity...&quot;

&quot;To start a fight. I know.&quot;

&quot;Be careful. The child.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t hurt the child.&quot;

A chuckle. &quot;Kazuki, I&#39;m more worried about the child hurting you.&quot;

---------------

Minako. Pretty girl. Very pretty. It&#39;s been a...long time, hasn&#39;t it...? 
A very long time... She&#39;ll notice your staring, though. Ask her to knock 
on the door. Concentrate, now. You can&#39;t start all of this flustery 
nonsense.

&quot;Are you alright, Mitsuki?&quot;

&quot;Oh...I&#39;m sorry! I was um...thinking,&quot; Mitsuki muttured, scratching the 
back of her head. Her face was a bit flushed. &quot;Are you going to knock?&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; Minako knocked on the door. &quot;Setsuna, Hotaru? Are you two 
there?&quot;

&quot;One second!&quot; Hotaru opened the door and smiled solemnly at Minako. 
Mitsuki glanced down at the child. She had very wide, sad eyes, and she 
was terribly pale. Mitsuki&#39;s mind flashed to another girl, taller, 
lankier, with tired green eyes and inky black hair.

Kazuki...she&#39;s like Kazuki was.

&quot;You look like a lady I know,&quot; Mitsuki said before she realized it. She 
had no idea how she would know how Kazuki looked as a child; she hadn&#39;t 
met the woman until she was well into adulthood.

Hotaru turned toward Mitsuki and gave her a look that was far too 
piercing, too strange. It was almost as if the girl was staring through 
her. &quot;Is she pretty?&quot;

&quot;Very much so. But her eyes are green.&quot; Mitsuki smiled down at Hotaru, 
and inwardly sighed when the child smiled back.

&quot;Where is she?&quot;

&quot;Somewhere...far away.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; The child shuffled. &quot;You guys can come in now. Setsuna-mama made 
us tea.&quot;

------------

Setsuna glanced up at Minako and the other young lady when they entered 
the room. She smiled softly. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve come to visit, Minako. Who 
is your friend?&quot;

&quot;Oh! This is Mitsuki.&quot; Minako bit her lip, and added quietly, &quot;The girl, 
you know. Michiru and Haruka probably told you...&quot;

&quot;I already know,&quot; Setsuna responded just as quietly. &quot;For her benefit.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Right! Okay. How are you doing today, Setsuna?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m quite alright. Please, sit.&quot; The two girls did so, and Setsuna 
joined them. &quot;Hotaru and I were just spending a quiet day together, when 
you...&quot; she paused suddenly, turned toward the window. Her eyes 
narrowed. &quot;That&#39;s odd...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Minako asked, blinking when Mitsuki suddenly stood up. She was 
shaking visibly.

&quot;Kazuki...&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Minako asked again, looking from Setsuna to Mitsuki in turn. 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Kazuki is here...and if she&#39;s thinking the same way Ririko and Nami 
were when I saw them...we&#39;re in danger! You three...stay here. I&#39;ll 
handle it.&quot;

Minako blinked. &quot;Huh? Wait, you can&#39;t go out there by yourself!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; The white-haired girl quickly made her way out of the 
room, and Setsuna glanced over at Minako.

&quot;She&#39;s right, you know. That woman is very dangerous. I thought...hm. 
Something is wrong...&quot;

&quot;But you can&#39;t tell us,&quot; Minako finished, sighing. &quot;It&#39;s okay though!&quot; 
She grabbed her transformation pen. &quot;We&#39;ll help anyway!&quot;

Setsuna smiled weakly. &quot;Right.&quot;

&quot;Can I come?&quot; Hotaru asked suddenly. Setsuna frowned.

&quot;I...don&#39;t see why not. We&#39;re going to need all the help we can get...&quot;

-------------

Kazuki loved the snow. She leaned against a streetlight and allowed the 
soft snowflakes to gather in her hair, touch her face. She smiled 
serenely, adjusted the sword on her back. She felt a hum reverberate in 
her head.

&quot;Dear Levantine,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be using you too 
much. I&#39;ve been ordered not to kill them.&quot; She frowned, yawned. 
&quot;Honestly, what&#39;s taking so long...&quot;

&quot;Kazuki!&quot;

&quot;Speak of the devil...&quot; Kazuki stepped away from the streetlight and 
grinned when she saw Mitsuki. &quot;Your hair. You&#39;ve changed it, I see.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve cut yours,&quot; Mitsuki said a bit hesitantly, swallowing hard. &quot;So 
I guess you&#39;ve come to hurt me too...&quot;

&quot;Ah, so you know.&quot; Kazuki glanced up at the sky. &quot;And you still intend 
to fight, knowing who I am and what I can do?&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t let you hurt people!&quot;

Kazuki chuckled, stood to her full height. The chilly wind made strands 
of hair dance against her face. Even in the cold weather, there wasn&#39;t a 
blush to her cheeks, her skin looked as if it was made of porcelain. She 
pulled her black coat up against her face, adjusted her gloves. &quot;Hurt 
people?&quot;

The wind moved furiously now, making her look as if she was hidden in 
the snow. Only her eyes were visible, sharp and bright green. &quot;I only 
intend to hurt you.&quot; </pre>
