<h1>Can't Fight the Moonlight</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Rei couldn&#39;t take it anymore....how could Serena do this to her!?
Finding that letter in her locker(did I mention they&#39;re in high school
and go to the same school???)...Rei was so mad...Slamming her locker
door closed, she turned to see the bubbly blonde coming down the hall
with Molly. Walking up to Serena and Molly, Rei waved the letter in
front of Serena&#39;s nose.

&quot;What the hell is this, Serena!?&quot;

Serena gulped loudly. &quot;A-a-a-a l-letter...?&quot;

Rei&#39;s face was about to erupt into flames. She hated when Serena tried
to play innocent...It never worked, she was such a bad actress.
&quot;About...?&quot;

Again, Serena gulped loudly. She didn&#39;t want to tell Rei to her face,
knowing she&#39;d have this reaction. So, she told Rei what had happened to
her in a letter. Bad choice. &quot;Your mangas...?&quot;

&quot;DAMN RIGHT MY MANGAS! HOW COULD YOU LOSE THEM SERENA! WHY I OUGHTA-&quot;

&quot;Guys...&quot; The fiery hot head and timid princess turned to look at their
friend with wavy red hair. &quot;People are starting to stare...&quot;

**************

Rei walked home, angrier than ever at her best friend. Her head
hurt...They have known each other for two life times now. And, as far
as they knew, at least one more...And no matter what, Rei could never
figure Serena out. It just seemed since Darien left for college last
year, Serena&#39;s ditziness had become more...what was the word Rei was
looking for? Advanced would be a good word. Rei sighed. She couldn&#39;t
stay mad at Serena for very long. Since Darien left, the two had seemed
to grow closer. Rei sighed again and turned the corner to climb the
temple stairs when a blonde ran her over.

&quot;Oh gods, Rei! I&#39;m SO sorry!&quot; It was Serena. Rei&#39;s anger was quickly
returning.

&quot;Serena,&quot; Rei growled in a warning sort of tone.

&quot;No, stop. Let me talk first.&quot; Serena helped Rei stand. &quot;Rei, I know I
lost your mangas, and I&#39;m sorry. Here,&quot; Serena pulled several bills out
of her pocket. &quot;This should cover the cost of them.&quot; And she handed the
money to Rei.

Rei only looked at Serena like she had lost her mind. Counting the
money, Rei nearly fell over. &quot;Serena! There&#39;s over fifty bucks here!&quot;
Serena only looked at Rei. Shaking her head, she put the money back
into Serena&#39;s hand. Or, tried to any way. When Serena refused to take
the money back, Rei said,&quot; Serena, I can&#39;t take this. It wouldn&#39;t be
right.&quot;

Serena only shook her head. &quot;I lost your comics, so I&#39;m paying for
them. NO arguments. Bye!!&quot; Serena gave Rei her biggest smile and
quickly walked away before Rei could react to this.

Rei just stood there, staring after her friend. Slowly smiling, Rei
shook her head and climbed the stairs to her home.

*************

Rei sat in her bedroom, staring at the wall in front of her. Something
in her life was missing. Every now and then her heart would burn, then
ache. She knew this sign. It meant she was in love. Mina, being the
senshi of love, even pointed this out. But, who was it? It wasn&#39;t
Chad... He still worked at the temple, but they never got serious with
each other. Their feelings turned out to be nothing more than a big
crush. He&#39;s been long ago married, and Rei was happy for him.

Rei laid back down in her bed and closed her eyes. That familiar
feeling of heart ache and butterflies in her stomach was returning
again...On nights like these she couldn&#39;t sleep. She needed someone to
talk to...

&quot;Rei?&quot; Came a whispered voice.

Rei&#39;s eyes shot open as she sat back up. &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; She whispered
back.

&quot;Open the window, Rei! I&#39;m cold!&quot; An irritated look crossed Rei&#39;s face.
She knew that whining from anywhere. Kicking the covers off the bed,
she sat up on her knees to open her window. She was right. Serena stood
on a trash can trying to get into Rei&#39;s room. Helping Serena through
the window, Rei asked, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

After climbing through the window, Serena sat on the bed cross legged.
She wouldn&#39;t look at Rei and her head was bowed. Rei narrowed her eyes
so she could look at Serena better in the dim light. Rei noticed a tear
slide down Serena&#39;s face.

&quot;&#39;Rena? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Rei was concerned. Serena never cried except for
a reason. When she didn&#39;t answer, Rei reached over and enveloped Serena
in a hug. Serena seemed to cry harder at this point and Rei&#39;s grip
tightened. Rei knew what kind of emotional state Serena could be at
times, but this was by far the worst she had seen her friend in a long
time. Even when Darien broke up with her a few years back...

&quot;He&#39;s not coming back, Rei...&quot; Rei looked at Serena.

&quot;What do you mean, &#39;Rena?&quot; Rei brushed Serena&#39;s hair out of her face.

&quot;I got a- ::hiccup:: a l-letter from D-darien to-::hiccup:: today...He
says he&#39;s not coming back to Tokyo. Ever...&quot; A dam of new tears flooded
Serena&#39;s already tear stained face.

&quot;Oh, Baby...Did he say why?&quot;

Serena shook her head. &quot;He said we&#39;re not supposed to be together in
this life. I&#39;m supposed to be with another...&quot;

Rei was shocked. Then an image of Crystal Tokyo flashed in her mind.
&quot;What about Rini and the future kingdom?&quot;

&quot;He said that we&#39;d be together then and Rini will be born. He said he
even knew the person I&#39;m supposed to marry in this time...But he
wouldn&#39;t tell me.&quot; Serena&#39;s tears began to slow as Rei rocked her back
and forth.

&quot;Do you wanna stay the night, Serena?&quot; Rei asked. &quot;You can have my bed
and I can sleep in a nap sack on the floor-&quot;

&quot;I want you to stay with me, Rei,&quot; Serena said, cutting her off.

Rei smiled. &quot;Ok. I&#39;ll stay right here, alright?&quot; Serena nodded her
head. &quot;Here let me turn the light off.&quot; Serena let go of Rei so she
could get up. After Rei switched the lights off, she placed a tape in
her radio. Pressing &#39;play&#39; she walked back over to Serena and laid
down. Serena curled up next to Rei with her head on her chest (AN: I
said &#39;chest&#39; not &#39;breast&#39; for all you hentai minds out there) and one
had rested on Rei&#39;s stomach. The tape Rei had playing had a slow,
piano tune coming from it. It seemed almost sad.

&quot;Serena?&quot; Serena was nearly asleep when Rei woke her back up. &quot;This
song, Grandpa used to sing to me when I had trouble sleeping. Want me
to sing it to you?&quot; Serena slowly smiled. She loved being sung to
sleep. Nodding her head, Rei began to hum the first few notes before
singing to the music:

And she takes another step
Slowly she opens the door
Check that he is sleeping
Pick up all the broken glass and furniture on the floor
Been up half the night screaming now it&#39;s time to get away
Pack up the kids in the car
Another bruise to try and hide
Another alibi to write

Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

And there are children to think of
Baby&#39;s asleep in the backseat
Wonder how they&#39;ll ever make it through this living nightmare
But the mind is an amazing thing
Full of candy dreams and new toys and another cheap hotel
Two beds and a coffee machine
But there are groceries to buy
And she knows she&#39;ll have to go home
Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

By this time, Rei had some how changed positions. Although Serena wasn&#39;t
laying on her except for her arm, she was still curled up next to her.
Rei, waiting for the chance to sing again, began playing with Serena&#39;s
hair...

Another bruise to hide
Another alibi to write
Another lonely highway in the black of night
But there&#39;s hope in the darkness
You know you&#39;re going to make it

Another ditch in the road
Keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Silent fortress built to last
Wonder how I ever made it...

Rei, by the end of the song, was tracing Serena&#39;s jaw line with her
fingers. As the last note faded, Rei leaned forward and kissed Serena&#39;s
forehead. She smiled when Serena seemed to snuggle closer to her. Rei
pulled the covers up higher and fell asleep with Serena in her arms.

****************

When Rei woke up the next morning, she felt something pressed against
her, a warm breeze in her ear, and unfamiliar weight over her
chest. Sleepily looking down, she noticed the weight to be an arm.
Turning her head slightly, she could see part of Serena&#39;s face, her
nose next to Rei&#39;s ear. Shaking her head at her friend, Rei moved
Serena&#39;s hand down to her waist. Serena tightened her grip, pulling Rei
closer. Rei sighed...

Looking up at the clock, it was five in the morning. Rei smiled. &quot;I&#39;m
so glad it&#39;s Saturday,&quot; she said aloud to herself. Stretching, she
added, &quot;I can sleep in today and get some extra rest. I&#39;m so ::yawn::
tired...&quot; Turning over and facing Serena, Rei smiled. Serena was a
sight to see in the morning. Snuggling deeper into her bed, Rei closed
her eyes again. Just as she was about to fall back to sleep, Serena
began to cry. Opening one eye, Rei noticed Serena shaking from the
tears. Rei pulled her arm from out of Serena&#39;s grip and gently
caressed the other girl&#39;s face. Whispering to her, Serena finally
calmed down. Peacefully resting again, Serena moved closer to Rei,
placing her head under Rei&#39;s chin. Rei didn&#39;t have the heart to wake
her up...

*************

(Later that day)

&quot;Rei!&quot; Rei, smiling, poked her head out of her bedroom door. &quot;Mail
call!&quot; It was Chad.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Looking back into the room, she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back,
guys.&quot; And Rei left to go get her mail.

&quot;So,&quot; Mina said. &quot;What are everybody&#39;s plans for spring break?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to America to visit my aunt and uncle,&quot; Lita said. The
others looked at her. &quot;Ya know...? The ones who support me? They&#39;ve
been wanting me to come and visit them for a while so I thought this
would be the perfect time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s cool,&quot; Mina said. &quot;I&#39;m going to England to visit a few other
friends there. Katrina, mainly.&quot; Mina looked at Ami. &quot;What about you,
Ames?&quot;

&quot;Mother has a conference to go to in Canada. It&#39;s really for two days,
but Mother thought it would be a good time to catch up. Sort of a
mother-daughter week.&quot;

&quot;Great. Hey, Sere? What about you,&quot; Lita asked. &quot;Plan on going to visit
Darien?&quot; The others laughed.

Serena looked down at the floor. She had yet to tell them about the
letter Darien sent her. Luckily, before she could answer, Rei came back
through the door.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got plans now. Remember that Shinto Fair, I told you about?
Well, Grandpa got me two tickets to go up there for the week.&quot; Rei
closed the door and sat back down next to Serena.

&quot;Way to go, Rei!&quot; Lita exclaimed. &quot;I remember how much you said you
wanted to go to that thing. Bit of a learning experience?&quot;

&quot;I dunno...&quot; Rei&#39;s smile grew. &quot;But I can&#39;t wait!&quot;

The girls stayed a while more before going home to get ready for their
own trips. Serena was the last to leave. As she began to go home, Rei
stopped her.

&quot;Hey, Serena? Can I ask you something?&quot;

Serena looked at Rei. &quot;Sure. What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t remember you saying anything about plans for this week.
Grandpa can&#39;t go with me to the fair...Do you wanna go with me? It&#39;s
free. Gramps, when he bought the tickets, paid for everything for two.
I really don&#39;t want to go by myself.&quot;

Serena thought about it for a few minutes. Smiling and nodding, she
answered. &quot;Sure.&quot;

************** (The lodge at the Shinto Fair)

&quot;Wow...&quot; Serena gasped as she entered the room in which she and Rei
would be staying for a week. &quot;It&#39;s so BIG!!&quot;

Rei laughed at her friend as she began to explore the large room. The
lodge room itself was the size of a small apartment with a living area,
kitchen, a bedroom, a large bath room, and a small balcony. Rei sighed,
knowing she&#39;d be the one to carry the luggage to the bed room. When she
walked into the room, Serena was coming out of the bathroom.

&quot;Rei, you need to check out the bath room. IT&#39;S HUGE!&quot;

&quot;I will, Sere. But, first, we need to unpack. Do you want the closet or
dresser?&quot; Rei asked, setting down their bags.

Serena shrugged. &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; Walking over to the closet and
opening it, she added, &quot;I doubt it would matter. The closet is huge,
too!&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes. &quot;Everything is huge to you, Serena. Is there
anything else I should know of that&#39;s huge...?&quot;

Serena looked at her friend before the realization of her words hit
her. &quot;Yeah, Rei. Your mouth!&quot;

Rei laughed. &quot;That&#39;s not what I was talking about.&quot;

Serena just rolled her eyes and shook her head in defiance, &quot;I know
that! Duh!&quot; The two girls laughed harder.

&quot;Come on, &#39;Rena. We need to get ready for dinner.&quot; Rei picked up her
two bags and placed them on the bed. &quot;We need to wear the traditional
kimono robes...Serena are you listening to me? I knew you wouldn&#39;t have
one, so I bought you one. Here, I hope you like it.&quot; Rei handed Serena
a kimono robe. It was pink with light red rose imprints. The sash
around the waist was also red.

Serena gasped as she held it up to her. &quot;Wow, Rei... You didn&#39;t have
to...I could have bought it myself--&quot;

&quot;I know, &#39;Rena. But...I don&#39;t know. I saw it yesterday when I went
shopping for mine and thought of you.&quot; Taking hold of one of the
sleeves to look at it better against her friend&#39;s body, Rei cocked her
head in thought. &quot;I just hope it fits. It was the only one they had and
I think it was the smallest size. But, you have a tiny waist...Should
fit.&quot; Rei dropped the sleeve.

&quot;Thanks, Rei. Where&#39;s yours?&quot; Serena asked, lying hers back n the bed
neatly so it wouldn&#39;t wrinkle.

&quot;Right here,&quot; Rei said proudly, revealing her own kimono. It was a
deep, rich purple with light lavender out lines of lilies. The sash was
a dark blue. &quot;Pretty huh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah! When do we eat?&quot; Serena asked, a sparkle in her eyes. Rei only
laughed...

*********

(four hours later(AN: I just skip everything, don&#39;t I?))

&quot;Man...&quot; Serena said, stepping into the hotel room. &quot;That was one hell
of a party. Great food too.&quot; Stretching, she turned to face Rei. &quot; Are
we gonna be going to dinners like that ALL week?&quot;

Rei thought for moment. &quot;I think so. But, the others aren&#39;t mandatory.
This one was. And. if you do go the others, you can wear normal
clothes, not the kimonos.&quot;

Serena seemed to frown. Popping her back, she asked, &quot;Can we wear the
kimonos?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see why not. After all, this is a Shinto Fair. I don&#39;t see the
big deal with it.&quot;

&quot;Cool. I&#39;m gonna soak in that hot tub. Wanna join me?&quot;

Rei thought for a minute. &quot;I might. But I need to un-pack first.&quot; As
she began to head towards the bedroom she stopped. &quot;Serena...what about
bathing suits?&quot;

&quot;What about em?&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you getting in the hot tub?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you gonna wear a bathing suit?&quot;

Serena look dumbfounded. &quot;Oh, I forgot...&quot; Thinking for minute she
said, &quot;I&#39;ll just put a lot of bubbles in it and we can get in naked.&quot;

&quot;SERENA!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Serena turned to look at Rei, who&#39;s face was as red as her
sailor uniform. &quot;What&#39;s wrong Rei? Nervous?&quot;

Rei gave Serena a death look. &quot;No,&quot; she said a little too quickly.
&quot;It&#39;s just that...well...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rei?&quot; Serena laid a hand on Rei&#39;s shoulder but Rei
brushed it off.

&quot;Don&#39;t...&quot; Rei wouldn&#39;t look at Serena and her face had grown pale.
Rubbing her face with her hands, she whispered, &quot;Not again. Oh, Gods,
not again...&quot;

*************

The girls went to bed that night, with out saying a word to each other.
Rei, feeling she had hurt Serena&#39;s feelings, refused to share the bed
with her. Instead, she slept on the leather couch in the living room.
Rei had yet to tell the girls why she had transferred to their school
at the beginning of their senior year. She felt there was no reason to
tell them. A week after senior year at school started, Rei was raped by
a group of boys that went to the neighboring boys school. Rei refused
to go to the police. She had gotten pregnant, too. That&#39;s when she
transferred. After she did, she had a miscarriage and lost the baby.
Despite how the baby was conceived, she didn&#39;t want that to happen.
But, ever since that day, being naked with some one else with her, even
her closet friends, scared her.

She turned over to face the back of the couch when she heard Serena get
up. Rei could hear her padded feet walk across the floor and stop behind
her.

&quot;Rei?&quot; She whispered. Rei said nothing. Sighing loudly, Serena sat down
on the coffee table. &quot;Rei, answer me. I know you&#39;re awake. I could hear
you crying all the way into the bedroom.&quot;

Rei felt her cheeks. They were wet. She had been crying and didn&#39;t even
know it. Rei shook her head. &quot;Go away, Serena.&quot;

&quot;Rei, what is wrong? You&#39;ve been like this since we got back from the
party. Rei, I&#39;m worried about you-&quot;

Rei sat up quickly and yelled, &quot;I said, GO AWAY!&quot; Even in the dark,
Serena could tell her friend was shaking from the tears.

&quot;Rei...&quot; Serena didn&#39;t know what to say. &quot;I&#39;m just worried about you...
Fine.&quot; Serena stood and walked to the bedroom door. Stopping and
turning back around, she said, &quot;I&#39;ll probably be awake for awhile. If
you want to change your mind to ease mine, come talk to me, ok?&quot; Before
she could get answer, Serena walked into the room and closed the door.

**************

Serena didn&#39;t expect Rei to follow her into the bedroom. So, when she
entered the room and closed the door, she turned out the lights and
laid back down. But she couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. The way she had seen
Rei scared her so much...Serena has seen Rei cry twice since they had
met in this time. Once when Nephlite died in Molly&#39;s arms and when they
discovered Serena to be the Moon Princess. Now, this would be the third.

Serena rolled over onto her side. This was eating her up... Rei was her
closet friend, even among the scouts. She hated it when her friends
were hurting and she didn&#39;t know how to help. Sighing she looked
towards the door...Amazingly enough, it opened. And Rei walked in.

Sitting up, Serena looked at her in the darkness. They didn&#39;t say
anything to each other, only stared. Rei shook her head and began to
walk back out before Serena could question her.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

Too late.

Rei stopped and turned back to face her friend. Only now she was out of
the bed and standing next to it. Unsure of what was going on. Rei felt
the same way.

&quot;Rei, you ok?&quot; Serena could hear Rei choke as she tried to stop the
tears from falling down on her face. Rei stood there as Serena slowly
began to walk towards her. Finally breaking down, Serena picked up the
pace and was able to catch Rei before she feel to her knees. Holding
Rei in her arms, Serena rubbed Rei&#39;s back with one hand and massaged
her scalp with the other. Serena gently lowered Rei to the floor, no
longer able to hold the taller girl up on her feet. &quot;Rei...please tell
me what&#39;s wrong.&quot;

Rei cried hared as she relived the painful memory to Serena. By the
time she was finished, it was an hour later and both girls were crying.
Hugging her friend tighter, Serena reassured her. &quot;Rei, it&#39;s ok. They
can&#39;t do it again, I promise. I&#39;ll help you get over your fear, ok? I
wish you had told me that earlier...I would have dropped it. You know
that, right?&quot; Rei only nodded. &quot;Come on, Rei,&quot; Serena said, helping her
friend stand. &quot;Lets go to bed.&quot; Rei said or did nothing as Serena
guided her to the bed and made her lay down. Playfully nudging her,
Serena said, &quot;Move it or lose it, Pyro. You&#39;re such a bed hog.&quot; Rei
only smiled.

Rolling over, Rei pulled the cover up to her chest and closed her eyes.
Serena moved in next to her and put on arm around Rei&#39;s waist. Opening
her eyes and turning slightly to look at Serena, Serena only smiled.

Moving her face so it was right by Rei&#39;s ear, Serena whispered, &quot;You&#39;re
never alone Rei. You&#39;re my best friend, and I will always love you.&quot;

*********

Rei laid in bed still asleep. After what happened last night with
Serena...Rei needed the rest. Serena, on the other hand, was trying to
find a way to help Rei get over her fear. She had gotten up early (for
Serena, anyway) and headed straight for the shower. After about an hour
under the steamy water, Serena emerged from the bath room wearing only
a towel around her body. Her hair was also wrapped up into a towel.
Walking over to the bed, Serena sat down and looked at Rei. She seemed
to look better than what she did last night. Brushing some of the hair
from Rei&#39;s face, Serena lowered her head to whisper into Rei&#39;s ear.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Serena quietly called. &quot;Time to get up...&quot; She smiled when Rei&#39;s
face showed frustration. It was obvious she didn&#39;t want to get up.
&quot;Come on, Rei. You can&#39;t stay in bed forever.&quot;

Rei opened one eye to look at her friend. &quot;Why not? You seem to live in
your bed. Why can&#39;t I?&quot;

Serena&#39;s smile only grew. &quot;Mornin&#39;, Sleepy head.&quot;

Rei&#39;s attitude shifted from anger to annoyance. &quot;Oh, shut up....&quot; Rei
closed her eyes and turned over away from Serena.

&quot;Come on, Rei! It&#39;s a beautiful day!&quot;

&quot;How would you know? I bet you haven&#39;t even been outside yet!&quot;

&quot;Rei!&quot; Serena was getting a little annoyed. &quot;You don&#39;t get out of this
bed, I&#39;m gonna flip you out of it,&quot; Serena threatened.

Rei pulled the covers over her head. &quot;I&#39;d like to see you try, Meatball
head,&quot; Came Rei&#39;s muffled reply.

Serena shrugged and walked over to her side of the bed. &quot;Last chance,
Rei...&quot; Serena got no reply. &quot;Ok, Rei. You asked for it.&quot; Despite her
small size, Serena was able to lift the mattress and flip it over.
Needless to say, Rei went flying into the floor. She was also very
angry...

&quot;DAMMIT SERENA! Couldn&#39;t you let me sleep a little longer!?&quot;

Serena still stood on the other side of the bed, a triumphant smile on
her face. She had her hands on her hips and her head was tilted to the
side. Still smiling, Serena said, &quot;I told you to get up...&quot;

*************

After Rei cussed Serena out a while longer, she too headed for the
shower. But she only took about thirty minutes or so. After coming out
of the bath room and fully dressed (she was still nervous even though
she had told Serena why) the two friends headed out of the hotel
towards a small town. The town was the place most of the activities
were being held for the festival. The streets were crowded and there
was hardly any room to walk with out bumping into someone.

&quot;Man, Rei,&quot; Serena said trying not to bump into people. &quot;It&#39;s so
packed! I didn&#39;t see this many people last night.&quot;

Rei shrugged. &quot;It could be tourists, Serena Did you think that this
festival wasn&#39;t open to the public?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Serena said shyly. &quot;I didn&#39;t think about it at all.&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes. &quot;So, &#39;Rena? Whatcha wanna do?&quot;

Serena shrugged. &quot;I dunno. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s here. Do you?&quot;

&quot;Not really. How about we just walk around? Then, if we see something,
we&#39;ll either buy it or do it. How&#39;s that?&quot; Serena smiled and agreed.

They walked for a while, played a few games, ate lunch, walked around
some more...Nothing really happened that day. But, the nights were
something else. After grabbing a bite to eat for dinner, the pair
headed for a small clearing with a small platform in the middle. The
platform was at least ten feet tall with a set of drums at the top. Rei
smiled.

&quot;This is where the drum ceremony will be held tonight. I hear the
drummer is very good.&quot;

Serena smiled. &quot;Really? I&#39;ve never been to one of these drum things
before. Have you?&quot;

Rei nodded. &quot;Once, right after Dad dumped me off on Grandpa.&quot; Stopping,
Rei looked at Serena in the setting sun&#39;s light. &quot;Have I told you about
that?&quot;

Serena had an odd look on her face. &quot;No. I always figured your parents
died, Like Lita&#39;s did. What happened?&quot;

Rei shrugged and looked back up towards the lifted platform. Closing
her eyes, she tried to recall what happened. &quot;When I was about six
years old, my mother died of cancer. When I was ten, Dad dumped me off
on Gramps because he knew he couldn&#39;t raise a child on his own. Not
with his job and him moving to America.&quot; Rei opened her eyes and Serena
could see unshed tears in them. &quot;Gramps and I hardly knew one another.
I kinda kept to myself since I was scared of the man. About a week or
two after I was left with him, he took me to a festival like this one.
But that one was only for a day. That&#39;s when I first saw the drum
ceremony. I fell in love with it the moment I watched it.&quot; Rei smiled.

So did Serena. She had never seen Rei so open before. Serena looked up
at the platform as well. Not knowing why, but knowing Rei needed her
comfort, Serena&#39;s hand seeked out Rei&#39;s. When she found it, she inter
laced her fingers with Rei&#39;s. Rei either didn&#39;t notice or didn&#39;t care.

After the ceremony was over, a spectacular fireworks show exploded to
life. All the different colors and shapes of the explosions made a
smile appear on Serena&#39;s face.

&quot;It&#39;s so pretty, Rei,&quot; Serena whispered.

Rei smiled. Serena could act like such a child at times. But her
innocence was such a pleasure to know. &quot;Yes, it is.&quot; Rei bit her lip.
Looking at Serena, who still had her eyes glued to the show above them,
Rei whispered, &quot;Thanks for coming with me, Serena. I&#39;m having a great
time with you here.&quot;

Serena looked at Rei and smiled. Rei could see her blush in the light
of the fireworks. &quot;I&#39;m glad you invited me, Rei...&quot; Serena&#39;s smile
faded when she saw a couple that was standing next to Rei.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Serena?&quot; Looking to where Serena&#39;s gaze had fallen,
she saw a couple who had an uncanny resemblance to Serena and Darien.
Rei knew instantly what was wrong. Rei&#39;s hand tightened, giving a
reassuring pressure on Serena&#39;s hand. Serena tore her watery gaze from
the happy couple back to Rei.

Lightly tugging on her hand, Rei whispered, &quot;Come on Meatball Head.
Lets go back to the room.&quot;

**************

Rei had to practically lead Serena back to their hotel room. Serena&#39;s
heart had been ripped out again and Rei couldn&#39;t help her friend&#39;s
pain. When they reached their room, they finally released each other&#39;s
hand. But, only long enough for Rei to unlock their door. Opening the
door, she dragged the shell that was her best friend into the room and
closed the door.

Rei let go of Serena&#39;s hand and went to the restroom. She had an urge
to go all day but refused to use the port-a-toilets that were scattered
around the grounds for the tourists. To her, those things were gross.
Coming out of the bathroom, Rei felt better. But, that was until she
saw Serena. She had moved out onto the small balcony and was just
staring at nothing. Rei kinda figured her to be remembering she and
Darien had went through together in years past.

Rei silently walked out behind her friend. &quot;Serena? Baby doll, you ok?&quot;
Rei always called Serena a name of endearment when she was hurting and
it was just the two of them. She saw Serena shake her head. Rei stepped
closer. &quot;Wanna talk about it?&quot;

Again, Serena shook her head. &quot;No, Rei. I don&#39;t. Because I know it
won&#39;t bring Darien back.&quot; Serena bowed her head and placed her hands on
the railing, bracing herself up. Rei felt a tear slide down her face.

Brushing it away, Rei walked up behind Serena and wrapped her arms
around the smaller girl. Resting her head on Serena&#39;s back, Rei
whispered, &quot;It&#39;s ok, Serena. You can cry about it. I won&#39;t laugh.&quot; Rei
could feel Serena holding back. &quot;Serena, no one will ever hurt you with
me around. I promise. Darien was...well...Darien was something that
just happened. You can be soul mates and still not be able to be
together. Things like this happen. You just have to move on.&quot;

Serena finally broke down. &quot;Gods, Rei. I miss him so much. Why doesn&#39;t
he love me, Rei?&quot;

Rei didn&#39;t know the answer to that question. &quot;I&#39;m not sure, &#39;Rena. But,
...the girls love you. Luna and Artemis love you. And I love you, too.
You&#39;ll always have me if nobody else to lean on Serena. I&#39;ll never let
you go.&quot;

Serena stood and turned in Rei&#39;s arms, facing her. Serena closed her
eyes, crossed her arms to her chest and leaned into Rei&#39;s warm embrace.
&quot;I love you, too, Rei. You&#39;re my best friend.&quot;

Rei kissed the top of Serena&#39;s head. &quot;Come on, Serena. Lets get you
inside and into bed. Tomorrow, I&#39;m taking you some place special.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Serena asked. &quot;Where?&quot;

Rei shook her head and smiled gently. &quot;Nope. It&#39;s a surprise. I&#39;m gonna
get ready for bed.&quot; Rei led Serena to their bedroom and picked her
night gown off of the floor. Walking to the bath room, Rei changed and
came back out. When she did, she saw Serena sitting on the bed waiting
for her. Without a word, Rei turned off the light and crawled
underneath the covers. Serena curled up next to her.

Resting her head on Rei&#39;s shoulder, Serena whispered, &quot;I&#39;m afraid of
facing the future without him, Rei. What do I do?&quot;

Rei&#39;s heart broke. Tightening her grip on Serena, Rei whispered. &quot;For
now nothing.&quot; Rei kissed Serena&#39;s temple. &quot;Sleep now and do not worry.
I will catch you if you fall.&quot; Serena smiled and closed her eyes.

**************

Serena stretched and snuggled closer to Rei. She wasn&#39;t fully awake yet,
and planned on staying that way for a while. But things changed when
she remembered Rei&#39;s promise to her from the night before. Sitting up,
Serena nudged Rei&#39;s arm.

&quot;Rei? You asleep?&quot;

Rei grumbled and cracked one eye open. &quot;I was... why?&quot;

&quot;I wanna know where you&#39;re taking me today. That&#39;s why,&quot; Serena
whispered as if it were a huge military secret. &quot;Come on Rei! I&#39;m dying
here!&quot;

Closing her eyes, Rei smiled. &quot;You are such a child, Sere. Go back to
sleep for a little while. It&#39;s still early.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s not,&quot; Serena said.

&quot;What time is it, then?&quot;

&quot;Nine thirty,&quot; Serena said, checking the clock.

Had Rei been standing, she may have face vaulted. &quot;Nine thirty!? Are
you out of your DAMN mind!?&quot; Rei kicked the blankets off and went to
the bathroom, mumbling something about being woke up by air headed
blondes.

Serena, who was still in the bed, smiled. &quot;I love you Rei,&quot; Serena
called, her smile growing.

&quot;Yeah, right!&quot; Rei answered from the bathroom. Coming out, Rei grabbed
her bathrobe and walked back in to the bathroom. &quot;So, Serena! Where do
ya want to go today,&quot; Rei called from the bathroom. Serena could hear
the shower being turned on.

&quot;Where you said you&#39;d take me, that&#39;s where!&quot; Serena crawled out from
the covers and sat on the edge of the bed. She was getting annoyed that
Rei was avoiding taking her where ever she said she would. &quot;REI!&quot;

&quot;Later, Sere,&quot; Rei called from the shower. &quot;I promise!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you,&quot; Serena yelled. She could have sworn she heard
Rei answer her by blowing a raspberry...

************

When Rei came out of the bathroom, clean and fully dressed, she filled
Serena in on what she had planned for the day.

&quot;Since tomorrow is the last day of the festival--&quot;

&quot;I though it lasted all week,&quot; Serena asked, cutting her off.

&quot;It usually does. But, something happened and they need to end it early
tomorrow. Anyway, I thought we could do something non-festival like
things before we headed home early. Whatcha think?&quot;

Serena sat there for a minute, thinking. &quot;Sure. But, you&#39;re still
taking be to that place, right?&quot;

Rei sighed and rolled her eyes. Picking up a pillow and throwing it at
Serena, she smiled. &quot;Yes I am. Now shut up about it!&quot;

************

After the two left their room, they went to a restaurant and ordered
breakfast. After that, they went to a car rental shop, and Rei rented a
black Ford pick up truck. Driving around, the two girls went and did
everything imaginable that there was to do in a such a small town.

First, the two girls headed for a movie. After that, they got lunch.
After they ate, they did some shopping in some of the antique shops.
Rei was a little nervous about bringing Serena into such a place with
so many breakable things. But, luckily, Serena didn&#39;t klutz out once.
After that, not knowing what else to do, the girls just drove around
for a while.

An hour before the sun began to set, Rei went into a small restaurant
and bought dinner. Much to Serena&#39;s dismay, they couldn&#39;t eat it yet.
As the sun began to set, and the sky was tinted with many different
colors hues, Rei took the truck back to the rental shop. From there,
Rei began to lead Serena back to the hotel room.

&quot;I thought you were taking me some place special today,&quot; Serena whined.
That&#39;s when Serena noticed Rei walked past the hotel. &quot;Where we going?&quot;

&quot;Where did I tell you we were going today, Meatball head,&quot; Rei asked.
&quot;Why do you think I wouldn&#39;t let you eat dinner yet?&quot;

Serena just looked at her friend. &quot;Um...to be mean?&quot;

Rei smacked Serena&#39;s arm. &quot;No, Meatball head! Its because it&#39;s part of
your surprise! Now shut up and follow me!&quot; Serena did as she was told
as she let Rei lead her to where ever it was she was taking her. Rei
walked off the sidewalk down onto a beaten path that was near creek by
the hotel. Walking down the path, Serena noticed trees but couldn&#39;t
think of their names. But, they were very beautiful.

&quot;Serena,&quot; Rei whispered. &quot;Come here.&quot; Serena walked to Rei and stood
beside her. Rei removed a handkerchief from her pocket and wrapped it
around Serena&#39;s eyes.

Serena smiled. &quot;What are you doing, Pyro?&quot; She could almost see Rei
smile.

&quot;Part of the surprise. Come on, Serena.&quot; Rei took Serena&#39;s hand and
began to walk her through the woods. Soon, after about five minutes of
walking, Serena could hear running water. After five or so more minutes
of walking, they stopped. &quot;Don&#39;t move and don&#39;t peek, either.&quot; Serena
stood there as she was told as Rei let go of her hand. Serena could
hear Rei doing something, but she wasn&#39;t sure what. Then, she heard Rei
yell, &quot;Mars Crystal POWER!&quot; Serena could feel the heat from Rei&#39;s
transformation. After she was finished transforming, she heard Rei
yell, &quot;Mars fire IGNITE!&quot; Serena could then feel a constant warmth. She
figured it to be Rei lighting a fire with her senshi powers.

&quot;Ok, &#39;Rena. Take off the blindfold.&quot; Serena did as she was told and
gasped lightly at the sight before her. Rei had taken her to a secluded
patch of the woods, where the same trees were growing densely around
them. Rei had ordered a dinner for two from that small diner and had
placed it on a blanket that she must have bought from the same place.
There was a small fire burning near the blanket and a creek with a
small water fall of no more than five feet tall behind them. The trees,
Serena remembered, were willows and cherry trees. The sight of the two
together were beautiful.

&quot;You like it?&quot; Serena finally remembered Rei was still there. She must
have detransformed while she was still taking everything in.

&quot;Very much. How did you find this place,&quot; Serena asked.

Rei smiled. &quot;Chad brought me here once trying to win me over. Never
worked, but I loved the place just as much as you do. I can tell,&quot; Rei
said before Serena could ask. &quot;I&#39;m psychic, remember?&quot;

Serena smiled, walked over to Rei and hugged her. &quot;Thank you, Rei.
Thank you for everything.&quot; Rei hugged her back. Releasing each other and
sitting down, Serena asked, &quot;Why did you bring me here, Rei?&quot;

&quot;Well, the willow appears frail yet hidden within is the strength that
defies the wind in the fury of the storm. It shelters and gives
protection to those that live beneath and with them. The cherry tree
also appears frail yet its beauty is unparalleled among the trees, it
is also strong like the willow, offering the comfort of its warm
embrace to those who know the truth. You are like both these trees. You
appear frail yet this is not the case. You are strong, beautiful. And
you protect those you love and offer them a sense of peace. Even to
those who try to hurt you.&quot; Rei smiled at Serena&#39;s face. She looked
like she was about to cry. &quot;You, more than any other person, are the
living embodiment of the truths behind the willow and cherry tree.&quot;

&quot;You...you think I&#39;m strong and beautiful like these trees,&quot; Serena
asked. She couldn&#39;t believe what Rei was telling her. As much as they
fought, Serena couldn&#39;t believe Rei had such nice things to say about
her.

They finished eating in silence. After that, they packed up what was
left of their food and began to walk back to the hotel. By now, it was
nine at night. So, it was a little chilly. Rei took the blanket they
had been sitting on and placed it around Serena&#39;s shoulders. Rei knew
that a gust of wind on a hot summers day could make Serena cold.

When the girls reached their room, they still said nothing to one
another. There was no need to. As the girls began to get ready for bed,
Serena noticed Rei do something she hadn&#39;t seen her do the entire time
they had been here. She stripped herself of her clothing and changed
into her night gown. In front of Serena. Serena smiled and changed into
her own night gown. The two friends crawled under the covers, Rei
turned out the light, and they fell asleep together.

****************

The last day of the trip was a little hectic. The girls woke up late
and began to take showers to get ready for the evening&#39;s dinner. They
packed everything other than what they would need for the night and
tomorrow&#39;s trip back home, and sat everything near their bedroom door.
Yet, somehow, through all this mess, they were able to find time to
eat.

After they had everything ready for the trip and dinner, they began to
get ready for the last dinner party. Despite the face it was just the
two of them there, the other three might as well have been. They kept
fighting over the bathroom until Rei said,

&quot;Screw it, Serena! I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re in the shower or not! I need
to do my hair!&quot; Rei charged into the bathroom and stood in front of the
foggy mirror. Finding a towel and wiping it clean, she began to fix her
hair for that night. She put her hair up in a loose bun with chop
sticks holding it in place.

Serena was now standing next to her, still wet, and in a towel. She was
brushing her hair out and blow drying it at the same time. It was a bit
of a hassle since she usually did this part naked. Now she was trying
to do it and hold up her towel.

After placing the finishing touches on her hair, Rei took the comb and
hair dryer from Serena. &quot;Just hold up your towel, Sere. Let me worry
about your hair.&quot; In ten minutes, Serena&#39;s hair was dry, up in it&#39;s
usual style, and Serena could now get ready as could Rei. &quot;Thank me
later. We need to get our asses moving.&quot; With that, Rei left the
bathroom to put on her kimono with Serena not far behind....

(A few hours and drinks later)

Serena was leaning against the wall laughing at Rei, who was giggling
because she couldn&#39;t find her key to the room.

&quot;Come on, Pyro,&quot; Serena said, lightly bouncing. &quot;I gotta pee!&quot; Rei only
giggled harder.

&quot;I found em!&quot; Rei proclaimed, holding the keys above her head.

&quot;Open the damn door, Rei! I gotta PEEEEEEEE!!!!!&quot;

Rei still only giggled as she tried to open the door. Finally opening
the door, Serena charged right by her and headed for the bathroom. Rei,
still giggling, closed the door and headed for the bedroom. Stripping
down to her bra and panties, she banged on the bathroom door.

&quot;Come on, Sere! I gotta go, too!&quot; The door opened and Rei walked in as
Serena walked out, still clothed. Rei closed the door and went to the
bathroom. After that, she let Serena back in so they could wash off
their makeup.

&quot;Did you have fun, Serena,&quot; Rei asked, washing her cheek off.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Serena said. It was now evident the girls were starting to sober
up. Throwing her wash cloth into the tub, Serena added, &quot;Thanks again
for inviting me Rei. I really did enjoy our time together.&quot;

Doing the same as her friend by throwing her wash cloth in the tub, Rei
smiled. &quot;Me too. It turns out your not such a ditz after all!&quot; Serena
gave Rei a look, but didn&#39;t argue. &quot;I&#39;m just kidding, Serena,&quot; Rei
said, hugging her friend. Serena hugged her back, but her heart sped
up. Rei let go of her and Serena began to undress as Rei left to turn
the bed down. When Serena was dressed in only her bra and panties, too,
she took her kimono and shoved in her bag. She knew Rei wouldn&#39;t care
because odds were, she did the exact same thing. Standing back up and
facing Rei, she saw her pulling the blankets down so they could go to
bed. Serena smiled. She and Rei hadn&#39;t had one fight the entire time
they had been here. Walking up to Rei, Serena shyly thanked her again.

Rei smiled and stood up straight. &quot;I told you once, you didn&#39;t have to
thank me, Serena. I enjoyed bringing you with me.&quot; Serena hugged her.

&quot;No. Thank you for being my friend Rei. I would have never gotten over
this thing with Darien if it weren&#39;t for you.&quot; Rei hugged her friend
back.

&quot;Serena....&quot; Rei didn&#39;t know what to say. Serena was the dearest person
in her life and she couldn&#39;t just stand back and not help her. &quot;Are you
ready for bed yet,&quot; Rei asked, not letting go of her. Serena nodded,
not letting go either. Rei shrugged and turned the lamp off.

When she did, and went back to holding Serena, that familiar pain of
heart ache clutched her heart. She didn&#39;t know why, but for some
reason, she wasn&#39;t very tired any more. Without realizing it, Rei took
the pins out of Serena&#39;s hair, letting it down. After that, she ran her
fingers through it to get the tangles out. Serena&#39;s grip tightened
around Rei&#39;s waist.

Serena brought her head up to lay her chin on Rei&#39;s shoulder. She
didn&#39;t know why, but she felt safer in Rei&#39;s arms than what she ever
did in Darien&#39;s. Then a thought flashed in Serena&#39;s mind. *Is Rei
supposed to be the one? Darien said I would know when we touched. And
every time Rei and I have touched one another, I&#39;ve felt a spark. I
wonder...* Serena licked her lips and placed a gentle kiss on Rei&#39;s
shoulder. When Rei didn&#39;t say anything, Serena continued to kiss her
friend until she reached her collar bone. That&#39;s when Rei stopped her.

&quot;Serena...&quot; Rei seemed a little scared. Then Serena remembered why.
Removing her arms from around her waist and cupping Rei&#39;s face, Serena
smiled.

&quot;I love you, Rei,&quot; Serena said before placing her lips on Rei&#39;s. She
could feel her tighten up a little, but then relax. Serena deepened the
kiss by coaxing Rei&#39;s hesitant lips open. One of Serena&#39;s hands left
Rei&#39;s face and snaked to the back of her head so she couldn&#39;t move. Not
that Rei had plans to, anyway. Serena pushed her body against Rei&#39;s and
they moved back until Rei tripped over the bed and they fell onto it,
with Serena on top of Rei. Serena released Rei&#39;s lips and looked into
her violet eyes. She could tell Rei was scared of what would happen
that night. Smiling, Serena closed her eyes again, and she and Rei
again claimed the others lips...

*************

Rei couldn&#39;t understand it. It had been a week since that night, and
She and Serena hadn&#39;t spoken since they got back home. Rei was so
confused...and mad. Serena was the one who started a chain of events
that night that she knew wouldn&#39;t stop if she followed through with it.
And now Serena was avoiding her. The girls couldn&#39;t figure out what was
wrong. Luna didn&#39;t even know.

Rei had to talk to Serena about this. But, Serena wouldn&#39;t talk to her.
She didn&#39;t return her calls, avoided her at the arcade... It was eating
Rei up on the inside. Why would she be avoiding me, Rei&#39;s mind
screamed.

She started it...

That&#39;s real mature....

Oh shut up! It&#39;s true...

Rei sighed. Now she was fighting with herself! Maybe she would read a
letter if I sent her one, Rei thought. With that thought of hope, Rei
took out a piece of paper and began to write...

*************

Serena laid in her bed and stared at the letter that laid un-open on
her desk. Rei had sent that to her yesterday and she refused to open
it. Tears sprang to Serena&#39;s eyes. She felt so bad... Rei never really
said she wanted to make love to her, but they continued. Serena felt
like she had raped her best friend. A tear slid down her face
remembering that night of passion. Then compared it to the train ride
home. Not a single word was spoken.

Serena dared not to tempt fate. Serena had seen Rei trying to catch up
with her, then hear her curse when she didn&#39;t turn around. *She&#39;s mad
at me, I know it* Serena thought. *What have I done?*

************

(That weekend, Party at Molly&#39;s)

&quot;Still no sign of her,&quot; Serena thought out loud. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I
should be happy or scared.&quot;

&quot;Who are you talking to, Serena?&quot;

&quot;Oh, crap!&quot; Serena jumped when Molly tapped her shoulder. Turning to
face her friend, Serena glared. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever do that to me again!!&quot;

&quot;Geez I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Molly said in her thick New York accent. &quot;What&#39;s
wrong? Where&#39;s Darien?&quot;

Serena sighed. &quot;We broke up a few weeks back.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. Is that why you&#39;ve been so bummed out lately?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Serena continued to scan the crowd for a tall black haired
priestess.

&quot;Then what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I...uh...&quot; Serena didn&#39;t know what to say. &quot;Remember that trip I went
on with Rei during break?&quot; Molly nodded. &quot;I ...uh...&quot; *THINK BRAIN!!*
&quot;Met someone there....&quot;

Molly looked at her friend. &quot;Are you ok? What happened?&quot;

&quot;We ...uh...went to a party, got a little tipsy and ...um....&quot; Serena
looked up at her friend&#39;s shocked face.

&quot;Oh my gawd...You&#39;re not pregnant, are you?&quot;

Serena nearly laughed. &quot;No. I doubt it.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

Serena held in her giggles. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m positive!&quot;

Molly sighed. &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad. So, what-&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t wanna talk about it,&quot; Serena said cutting her off. Molly
nodded in understanding. Looking around since there was nothing else
better to do, she saw Melvin had arrived.

A smile appearing on her face, Molly excused herself. &quot;If you don&#39;t
mind, Sere. I&#39;m gonna go.&quot;

Turning away from the crowd again, Serena asked why. Then noticing
where Molly&#39;s gaze had fallen, and smiled. &quot;Have fun.&quot;

An hour passed and still no sign of Rei. But when the other three girls
showed up...

&quot;So, Serena,&quot; Lita said, sipping her coke. &quot;What&#39;s been up with you and
Rei lately? Did you two have a fight during break or something?&quot; Serena
didn&#39;t answer.

&quot;You ok, &#39;Rena,&quot; Mina asked her friend. Serena shot a look at her.
&quot;Don&#39;t call me that,&quot; she said in a warning tone.

Mina put her hands up in defense. &quot;Ok. Calm down!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Look,&quot; Ami said. &quot;Rei finally made it.&quot;

Snapping her head away from her blonde friend, Serena looked
frantically for the other person in their party. Finally spotting her,
fear and dread gripped Serena&#39;s heart. When Rei approached them, Serena
said, &quot;I don&#39;t feel so well. I&#39;m gonna go home.&quot; And without so much as
another word, Serena took off in the opposite direction of Rei.

When Rei met up with the other girls, she received cold glares from
them. Ignoring them, she asked, &quot;Where did Serena go? I need to talk to
her.&quot;

&quot;What happened between you two, Rei,&quot; Ami asked. &quot;You two haven&#39;t
spoken to each other since you both got back from that trip during
break.&quot;

Rei sighed. There was no way of getting out of this. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you
ONLY after I&#39;ve spoken with Serena. Now, where is she!?&quot;

************

Tears flowed down Serena&#39;s face as she walked home. Even with her other
friends with her, she still didn&#39;t have the courage to face Rei. Serena
stopped walking and stood there on the deserted street. She stood
there, faced forward and stood into the nothingness before her.

Then, she cracked...

Eyes narrowing and a small flame beginning to flicker inside her brain,
Serena let loose on the closet thing to her: a brick wall.

Punching and kicking the wall, Serena began to curse every fiber of her
being.

&quot;Dammit, Serena,&quot; she said, hitting the wall again. &quot;You are so fucking
stupid!&quot;

&quot;Stupid!&quot;

Punch.

&quot;Stupid!&quot;

Punch.

&quot;STUPID!!!&quot;

The tears flowed down her face like a dam had burst in her body.
Serena fell against the wall and slid down it until she was sitting on
the sidewalk huddled up to the building she was just moments ago
pounding the crap out of. Closing her eyes, she thought she heard
footsteps running on the sidewalk but ignored them. She didn&#39;t care
anymore.

&quot;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing out here, Serena!&quot; Serena&#39;s
eyes shot open. Turning her head slightly, she saw who the voice
belonged to. And was scared.

Turning away, Serena asked, &quot;What are you doing here, Rei?&quot;

&quot;What am *I* doing here,&quot; Rei repeated. &quot;What are *you* doing here!?
You look like hell!&quot;

&quot;Shut up Rei. I&#39;m not in the mood for this.&quot; Serena slowly stood and
began to walk away from Rei.

&quot;I don&#39;t give a damn if you&#39;re in the mood or not, Serena,&quot; Rei said,
easily catching up to the Moon Princess. &quot;I want you to tell me what is
wrong!? You&#39;ve avoided me for days! What have I done!?&quot;

Serena stopped, turned on her heel and face her friend. &quot;It&#39;s not you!&quot;
She screamed. &quot;It&#39;s not you! It&#39;s me! ME, GAWD DAMMIT!&quot; Serena felt out
of control. Placing her hand on her head and walking again, she sensed
Rei right beside her.

&quot;Serena, please...&quot; Rei begged. &quot;Tell me what is wrong...&quot; Serena
didn&#39;t answer. &quot;&#39;Rena? Baby doll?&quot;

&quot;Rei,&quot; Serena said, her voice cracking. Turning back to face Rei,
Serena could see tears in her eyes too. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Rei looked at her. &quot;For what?&quot;

Serena looked up and down the deserted street. She didn&#39;t feel safe
here. &quot;Come on. Lets go to my place.&quot;

************

Rei followed Serena into her room, still very confused. &quot;Serena? What
is going on?&quot; Then Rei noticed her letter on Serena&#39;s desk. It still
had not been opened.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Serena said sitting on her bed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for that night.&quot;

&quot;What night?&quot; Then Rei stopped. She knew now which night she was
talking about. &quot;Why are you sorry for that? Didn&#39;t you want to-&quot;

&quot;NO! That&#39;s not it. I wanted to, yeah. But...I dunno. You never said
that *you* wanted to, and...and...&quot; Serena put her face in her hands.
She couldn&#39;t bring herself to say it.

Rei knew, though. She could sense what Serena was thinking. Walking to
Serena&#39;s desk and picking up the letter, Rei headed for Serena.
Kneeling in front of her. Serena could feel Rei&#39;s hands resting on her
own, trying to remove them. &quot;Serena, look at me. Please?&quot; Slowly,
Serena did as she was asked. Holding up the letter, Rei said, &quot;I want
you to open this, and read it.&quot; Serena looked at her and took the
letter. Opening it, she found a poem Rei had written for her.

Have you ever considered the Cherry tree and the
Willow tree
Both harbor great beauty
Yet each appears terribly frail
Fools are we that are deceived such

Their incredible beauty belies hidden strength
Strength that holds the tree firm as
Winds howl in tenacious fury
Trying to uproot beauty with destructive violence

Despite all the furious rage the winds throw
The Cherry and the Willow still stand
Strength and beauty wrapped in gentle form
Forever deceiving those without eyes to see

The Cherry tree provides us sweet smelling blossoms
Calming us in our anger and allowing
Us to see the beauty in the simplest of things
You are my Cherry tree

The Willow tree shelters from the storm
Giving us comfort when the winds howl with
murderous fury
Showing us its great and unknown strength
Let me be your Willow

Serena&#39;s hand went to her mouth as new tears flowed down her face.
Looking up at Rei, Serena flew forward and hugged Rei. Unfortunately,
both girls went flying backwards. Rei held Serena in her arms while
Serena, who was on top of Rei, cradled Rei&#39;s head and cried.

&quot;I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,&quot; Serena kept chanting
through her tears.

Rei smiled as a tear slid down her face. Kissing Serena&#39;s cheek, Rei
whispered back, &quot;I love you, too, &#39;Rena.&quot;

UNDER A LOVER&#39;S SKY
GONNA BE WITH YOU
AND NO-ONES GONNA BE AROUND
IF YOU THINK THAT YOU WON&#39;T FALL
WELL JUST WAIT UNTIL, &#39;TIL THE SUN GOES DOWN
UNDERNEATH THE STARLIGHT, STARLIGHT
THERE&#39;S A MAGICAL FEELING SO RIGHT
IT WILL STEAL YOUR HEART TONIGHT
YOU CAN TRY TO RESIST
TRY TO HIDE FROM MY KISS
BUT YOU KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU
CAN&#39;T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT
DEEP IN THE DARK
YOU&#39;LL SURRENDER YOUR HEART
DON&#39;T YOU KNOW, DON&#39;T YOU KNOW THAT YOU
CAN&#39;T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT
NO, YOU CAN&#39;T FIGHT IT
IT&#39;S GONNA GET TO YOUR HEART

THERE&#39;S NO ESCAPE FROM LOVE
ONCE THE GENTLE BREEZE WEAVES IT&#39;S SPELL UPON YOUR HEART
NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK
IT WON&#39;T BE TOO LONG &#39;TIL YOU&#39;RE IN MY ARMS
UNDERNEATH THE STARLIGHT, STARLIGHT
WE&#39;LL BE LOST IN A RHYTHM SO RIGHT
FEEL IT STEAL YOUR HEART TONIGHT

YOU CAN TRY TO RESIST
TRY TO HIDE FROM MY KISS
BUT YOU KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU
CAN&#39;T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT
DEEP IN THE DARK
YOU&#39;LL SURRENDER YOUR HEART
DON&#39;T YOU KNOW, DON&#39;T YOU KNOW THAT YOU
CAN&#39;T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT
NO, YOU CAN&#39;T FIGHT IT

NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
THE NIGHT IS GONNA GET TO YOU
CAN&#39;T FIGHT IT, DON&#39;T TRY IT
YOU&#39;RE NEVER GONNA WIN
&#39;COZ UNDERNEATH THE STARLIGHT, STARLIGHT
THERE&#39;S A MAGICAL FEELING SO RIGHT
IT WILL STEAL YOUR HEART TONIGHT

YOU CAN TRY TO RESIST
TRY TO HIDE FROM MY KISS
BUT YOU KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU
CAN&#39;T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT
DEEP IN THE DARK
YOU&#39;LL SURRENDER YOUR HEART
DON&#39;T YOU KNOW, DON&#39;T YOU KNOW THAT YOU
CAN&#39;T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT
NO, YOU CAN&#39;T FIGHT IT
