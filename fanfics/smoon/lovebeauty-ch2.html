<h1>Love and Beauty (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lovebeauty-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The next few days passed without any odd occurrences. Which was an odd 
occurrence in itself. For three whole days the five girls had been 
able to study without interruption. No demons, monsters or other 
supernatural threats manifested, no one seemed to need the energy of 
Tokyo denizens. Not even bad weather punctuated their lives. 

It was driving them crazy.

Rei laughed. &quot;Who would have thought that three peaceful days would 
make us all so cagey?&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;re you calling cagey, Rei-chan?&quot; Usagi complained, while trying 
to filch another cookie from the plate in the center of the table. Rei 
slapped her hand and the two tussled as they had so many times before. 

Ami sighed audibly. &quot;I think we need a day off. I proclaim tomorrow a 
holiday! We will do anything else, except study.&quot; She was a little 
abashed at the enthusiasm of the cheers. &quot;But then right back to 
work...&quot; she threatened.

Everyone nodded. Minako practically bounced up and down where she sat. 
&quot;After a day off, Ami-chan, we&#39;ll be so refreshed, we&#39;ll be even 
better at our studies!&quot; The rest of the girls nodded emphatically in 
agreement.

With this incentive before them, the rest of the afternoon passed 
quickly and studying was concluded with great fanfare. 

&quot;Usagi-chan, you&#39;ll probably go to the Crown tomorrow, right?&quot; Ami 
turned to their leader, who was helping clean with more enthusiasm 
than skill.

&quot;Yes and I&#39;ll meet Mamo-chan for a date!&quot; Usagi&#39;s voice overflowed 
with joy. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen much of him lately - he&#39;s been working so 
hard.&quot;

&quot;Well, why don&#39;t I meet you there and we can go shopping together?&quot; 
Ami asked shyly. Everyone stopped and stared at Ami. 

&quot;You&#39;re going shopping?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;You&#39;re not studying?&quot; Rei spoke at the same time.

Ami blushed prettily. &quot;I need some new shoes and I know how much 
Usagi-chan likes to shop...&quot;

Rei laughed, &quot;I&#39;ll come along! I need new shoes too!&quot; Usagi began to 
protest, but then agreed when Rei offered to take them to a new 
restaurant for lunch.

&quot;How about you, Mako-chan? Will you go shopping for shoes too?&quot; Minako 
turned to the taller girl. 

Makoto shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m not in a shopping mood. I thought I&#39;d make 
a picnic lunch and go to the park.&quot;

Minako laid a hand on her arm and asked quietly. &quot;Can I join you? You 
can show me how to make the steamed buns and then we can take some 
with us.&quot; 

Makoto swallowed in a suddenly dry throat. Not trusting her voice, she 
nodded. She watched Minako-chan&#39;s eyes light up with an unfamiliar 
fire. 

&quot;Great - I&#39;ll see you then!&quot; Minako laughed lightly and tripped away 
down the temple hill, catching up with Ami and Usagi, grabbing them by 
the arms and dragging them neatly down the steps. Makoto shook her 
head at the emotions about to overwhelm her.

Rei watched from her window, smiling to herself. &quot;She&#39;s about to be 
hit by something stronger than her own Supreme Thunder.&quot; Speaking the 
words, &quot;Senshi of Love and Beauty&quot; just barely audibly, Rei turned 
away.
