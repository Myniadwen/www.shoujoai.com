<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 10 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crawlspace.html">Crawlspace</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>	The weight room at the sports center was empty save one person.  
The sound of bare fists hitting the heavy bag echoed in the room as 
Makoto worked out her frustrations the only way she knew how.
	This hadn&#146;t been what she&#146;d intended to do after leaving school.  
Yet here she was, her bangs laying damp against her forehead and sweat 
running into her eyes.  Makoto blinked away the sting and brought a leg 
up to kick the bag.  Ignoring the twinge of pain this caused in her 
back, she continued her assault.
	Each punch and kick picked out a particular voice or face as a 
target.  Her right fist slammed into an imaginary Itoh-san as he listed 
for her in a cloying voice all the reasons she&#146;d be better off 
somewhere else.  Makoto also heard all the things that were left unsaid, 
danced around, and sugar coated.  Like how she was an embarrassment to 
them and how it made their stats look bad to have an unmarried, 
pregnant student.
	Her left fist swung around into Watashi-sensei.  The edge of her 
restlessness and anger from lunch had barely worn down when he&#146;d walked 
into the classroom and stood staring down his nose at her.  Wouldn&#146;t 
have expected to see her back, he&#146;d said, considering her condition.
	Another kick and a few more hard punches were leveled at the 
mental image of her history teacher.  The man had started in on her at 
the beginning of class and hadn&#146;t let up.  Every answer she gave him 
was either wrong or inadequate.  It got to the point where she could 
have told him that the sky was blue and the grass was green and he 
somehow would have found a way to make those answers wrong.
	On and on the assault continued.  Makoto attacked her classmates 
for the whispers and the gossip, her teachers for the looks of 
disappointment and disapproval, Yuu for ever walking into her life, and 
finally herself for allowing any of this to happen in the first place.
	So focused was she that Makoto didn&#146;t hear the door to the weight 
room open.  She never heard the other person enter or her footsteps as 
she walked up to Makoto.  Thus, when a strong hand grabbed her arm mid 
swing, Makoto whirled on her opponent, more than ready to continue the 
fight with a real person.
	Haruka took a defensive stance reflexively.  After a deep breath 
to calm her fighting instincts, she frowned at Makoto.  &#147;What the hell 
are you doing?&#148; she asked, annoyed and a bit angry at the younger girl.  
The sweat running down Makoto&#146;s face and staining her shirt was 
evidence enough that she had been at this for awhile.  She should know 
better, and Haruka wasn&#146;t going to let her get away with it.
	Makoto stood with her arms up and ready, the battlefire still in 
her eyes.  She squinted against the moister blurring her vision and 
finally focused on the person in front of her.  &#147;Haruka?&#148; she asked, 
feeling slightly confused.
	The blonde nodded and completely relaxed her stance.  Haruka was 
talking, Makoto realized, but she was having a hard time understanding 
what the older girl was saying.  The words were muffled, and she was 
finding it difficult to focus her eyes.  And with her sudden stop in 
movement, Makoto could now feel the weight in her overused muscles.  
That weight felt like it was pulling her down and making her extremely 
tired.
	Then, just like that, Makoto didn&#146;t want to do it anymore.  All 
she wanted was for the universe to go away and let her sleep.  As her 
eyes began to close and her mind slowed to a crawl, she heard a voice 
from far away calling her name.  She felt herself begin to fall, and 
the last sensation she was able to register was of something warm and 
strong.  Then there was only blessed blackness and peace.


*            *            *

	Throughout the ride to the hospital, Ami didn&#146;t move at all.  
Minako had gone to get Rei, saying not to try and wait for them and 
they would get there on their own.  That left Usagi sitting in the back 
seat with Ami as Setsuna drove.
	Usagi watched her friend as they rode.  Ami&#146;s head was down, her 
eyes watching the floor.  Her breathing was paced and deliberate, her 
chest rising and falling in equal lengths.  The hand Usagi was holding 
was griped tight to the point where Usagi&#146;s&#146; hand was going numb from 
lack of blood flow.  Yet the blonde held on, afraid as much for Ami as 
she was for Makoto, because this was too still and quiet even for Ami. 
	The car pulled into a parking spot, and Ami was out and heading 
towards the entrance even before the engine was turned off.  Setsuna 
and Usagi had a hard time keeping up with her as her pace quickened.
	Usagi could clearly see the panic rising to the surface in Ami 
now.  The sight made her own worries and fear worsen, and she wished 
very much that Mamoru and the others were here with her.
	&#147;Kino Makoto,&#148; said Ami to the woman behind the glass in the 
waiting room.  &#147;She was brought in just a little while ago.&#148;
	&#147;Are you family?&#148; asked the woman.
	Without hesitation, Ami answered, &#147;Yes.&#148;
	&#147;Just a moment,&#148; said the woman.  She disappeared through a door, 
and Ami turned back to Usagi and Setsuna.
	Usagi put a hand on her friend&#146;s shoulder.  With a surety she 
didn&#146;t feel, she said, &#147;She&#146;ll be okay, Ami.  I&#146;m certain of it.&#148;  
Usagi offered a weak smile that did little to calm the girl in front of 
her.
	A moment later, Ami heard her name called.  She turned to see her 
mother standing at the entrance to the ER proper.
	&#147;What happened?&#148; questioned Ami, the words coming out in a rush.  
&#147;Are they okay?&#148;
	&#147;Makoto&#146;s fine,&#148; answered her mother, her voice the doctor&#146;s tone 
she used when addressing her patients&#146; family members.
	&#147;The baby?&#148;
	&#147;He&#146;s fine, too,&#148; answered Kaya.  She brought her hands up and 
placed them on Ami&#146;s shoulders.  When she did she could feel the slight 
trembling in Ami&#146;s body.  She looked down at her little girl, worried 
for her.  Putting as much reassurance into her words as she could, Kaya 
went on, &#147;They&#146;re both going to be okay.  Makoto overexerted herself 
and as a result had a dizzy spell and blacked out.  She&#146;s lucky Haruka 
was with her when it happened.  But at the moment, she&#146;s a bit 
dehydrated and her blood pressure is elevated.  It needs to go down a 
bit more before we release her, but other then that, everything is 
perfectly okay.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s head turned to the doors Kaya had come through.  Her mother 
could see the worry and shine of tears in Ami&#146;s eyes.  She moved her 
hands from Ami&#146;s shoulders to her face.  Gently, Kaya turned Ami to 
face her.
	&#147;Ami,&#148; she said softly, &#147;I promise she&#146;s okay.  But we need her 
to stay calm and rest.  In order for that to happen, you need to be 
calm when you see her.  Understand?&#148; she asked gently.
	Kaya took a deep breath which Ami automatically imitated.  As she 
released the air slowly from her lungs, Ami closed her eyes and let her 
head fall forward onto her mother&#146;s chest.  Kaya put her arms around 
her daughter and held her while Ami&#146;s arms wrapped around her mother&#146;s 
waist.
	&#147;It&#146;s all right, sweetheart,&#148; said Kaya softly.  &#147;I know it was a 
frightening thing, but it&#146;s all over now.&#148;
	Ami nodded, her face still buried against her mother.  For a 
moment her grip tightened.  &#147;I&#146;m glad you were here to take care of 
her,&#148; said Ami, the words coming out muffled.  Then she looked up at 
her mother, a confused expression on her face.  &#147;Why are you here?  
Your shift ended more than eight hours ago.&#148;
	Kaya grinned.  &#147;I never left.  It&#146;s been a somewhat hectic day, 
and they needed an extra pair of hands.  And Saatchi-san has been the 
one taking care of Makoto.  I&#146;m just abusing my privileges and being 
nosey.&#148;  Releasing Ami from the hug and taking back some of her 
professional demeanor, Kaya asked, &#147;Are you ready to see her now?&#148;
	&#147;Just a minute,&#148; answered Ami.  She went over to where Setsuna 
and Usagi stood.  &#147;Mom says everything&#146;s okay.  I&#146;m going to go see her, 
so will you tell Rei and Minako when they get here?&#148;
	Ami barely waited for Usagi to give her an answer before she was 
back beside her mother and following her through the ER.
	Kaya led Ami back to a curtained off cubicle of a room.  When 
they entered, Haruka stood from the chair she&#146;d been sitting in.  Near 
her, Makoto lay on the bed, a blanket bunched up at her feet.  The 
hospital gown she should have been wearing hung over the back of the 
bed, while Makoto still wore her sweats and t-shirt.  A damp washcloth 
lay across her closed eyes.  One arm rested lazily over her head, a 
finger wrapped around the end of her ponytail.  The other arm was 
stationary on the bed beside her with an IV taped to it.  Ami could 
already see the bruise forming around the needle.
	Kaya excused herself while at the same time reminding them that 
there was only supposed to be one visitor back here at a time.
	Haruka bowed slightly to the older woman and promised to leave in 
just a moment.
	&#147;What happened?&#148; asked Ami quietly after her mother was gone.
	&#147;I went to the gym for a quick workout before I had to pick up 
Hotaru,&#148; answered Haruka.  She ran a hand through her hair, a nervous 
gesture that showed how frayed she was feeling at the moment.  &#147;When I 
saw her, she was beating the life out of the heavy bag in the weight 
room.  I go and stop her and the next thing I know, she&#146;s on a steady 
descent towards the floor.&#148;
	Ami shook her head.  &#147;She promised she wouldn&#146;t.&#148;
	&#147;Don&#146;t talk about me like I&#146;m not here.&#148;
	Both girls turned to the bed.  The hand that had been wrapped in 
her ponytail now held up an edge of the washcloth, and Makoto was 
glaring at them through one eye.
	&#147;You scared the hell out of me, Mako-chan,&#148; said Haruka.  &#147;That 
gives me the right to talk about you any way I want.&#148;
	Makoto dropped the washcloth back into place and went back to 
ignoring the people around her.
	Haruka smirked.  Then she mouthed to Ami, &#147;She&#146;s being stubborn.&#148;
	Ami nodded and then thanked Haruka for her help.
	&#147;Just glad I was there,&#148; answered Haruka.  She then made her 
goodbyes and went to wait with the others in the waiting room.
	Ami stood for several seconds just watching Makoto.  Then she 
went over and carefully sat on the edge of the bed.
	Makoto felt the bed shift and knew it was Ami sitting beside her.  
A moment later, the washcloth was lifted from her eyes.  She opened her 
eyes and watched as Ami slowly dipped it into the water beside the bed 
and rung it out.
	With a serious and concentrated expression on her face, Ami 
brought the edge of the washcloth to Makoto&#146;s forehead.  Gently, she 
ran it along the girl&#146;s hairline and down beside her ears.  A few more 
careful strokes along Makoto&#146;s cheeks and under her eyes, and Ami asked, 
&#147;Can you sit up?&#148;
	Makoto started to move, then grimaced.  &#147;I can&#146;t move the way I 
want to,&#148; she said, indicating her left arm.
	After a few more minutes of careful maneuvering, Makoto was 
sitting in an awkward position with one leg bent parallel against Ami&#146;s 
leg and the other curled around Ami from behind.
	&#147;Comfortable?&#148; asked Ami.
	Makoto nodded.  &#147;As much as I can be.&#148;
	Ami nodded back and placed a hand on the back of Makoto&#146;s neck.  
Her fingers found the knots there and gently began to work at them.  
&#147;Can you lean forward a bit?&#148;
	Makoto had closed her eyes when Ami&#146;s fingers started moving.  
Now, she made a small sound and did as asked.  She stopped when her 
forehead touched Ami&#146;s shoulder and rested there.
	This wasn&#146;t the most comfortable position to be in, Makoto noted, 
and Bug was probably feeling a bit smushed.  But this was the most 
relaxed she&#146;d felt all day, and be damned if she was going to move one 
second before she had to.
	Ami&#146;s fingers continued to work out the tension in Makoto&#146;s neck 
and shoulders.  Makoto didn&#146;t know how much time had passed when Ami&#146;s 
hand was replaced by the cool washcloth being draped across her neck.  
Makoto shifted slightly, getting a bit more comfortable.  At the moment, 
she was feeling truly and honestly tired.  Maybe if she could just take 
a little nap everything would okay when she woke up.
	&#147;Mako-chan,&#148; said Ami cautiously, &#147;you promised you wouldn&#146;t.  
You usually keep your promises.&#148;
	Makoto sighed.  No matter what, it never lasted.  She lifted her 
head from the other girl&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;I promised during lunch, and I 
kept that promise,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;This happened after history.  
And I didn&#146;t mean to do it.  I only wanted to go for a walk, but it was 
too cold outside.  So I went to the sports center.  One thing just led 
to another.&#148;  She frowned at the look on Ami&#146;s face.  &#147;Please don&#146;t be 
mad at me, Ami.  On top of everything else that&#146;s happened today, I 
don&#146;t think I can take it.&#148;
	Ami gave her a small smile.  &#147;I&#146;m not mad at you, Mako-chan.  
Really I&#146;m not.&#148;  She placed a hand over Makoto&#146;s.  &#147;It wasn&#146;t just Yuu, 
then, was it?&#148;
	Makoto shook her head.  &#147;Watashi-sensei laid into me during class.  
That was just the last rotten cherry on the whole rancid sundae.  By 
then I just needed to get away and breathe for awhile.&#148;
	&#147;What else happened?&#148; asked Ami.
	Makoto took a deep breath.  &#147;Itoh-san pulled me out of class 
during first period.  He spent the rest of that and all of second 
period telling me I&#146;d be better off across town at Memorial.  You know 
they have that half-day program?  The one for working students and 
those with &#145;family obligations.&#146;  But, damn it, I don&#146;t want to 
transfer!  Not again!  I earned my place in that school just like 
everyone else, and I&#146;m not going to let them push me out just because I 
make their numbers look bad.&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s okay, Mako-chan,&#148; said Ami soothingly.  Her thumb stroked 
across the top of Makoto&#146;s hand in an unconscious gesture to keep the 
girl calm.  &#147;We&#146;ll work something out.  They can&#146;t make you transfer 
this time.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m not going to drop out either,&#148; said Makoto adamantly.  &#147;You 
worked too hard getting us to pass the entrance exams for any of us to 
quit now.&#148;
	Ami smiled shyly at that.  &#147;You all worked hard.  If you had 
really wanted to, you could have done it without me.&#148;
	&#147;Nope,&#148; returned Makoto.  &#147;No way I would have been able to stay 
focused enough.  But we did it, and I can go to school and raise my son 
without any problems.  Though Itoh-san doesn&#146;t think so, since he spent 
nearly a half hour preaching the benefits of adoption after he realized 
I wouldn&#146;t leave.&#148;
	&#147;None of us ever thought you wouldn&#146;t be able to do it,&#148; assured 
Ami.  &#147;What anyone else thinks doesn&#146;t matter.&#148;
	Makoto nodded.  &#147;I don&#146;t want Bug to ever think I didn&#146;t want 
him,&#148; she said softly.  &#147;I know what that&#146;s like, when no one wants you, 
and it&#146;s a lousy feeling.  And when the only person in the world who&#146;s 
supposed to want you doesn&#146;t&#133;  I don&#146;t ever want to do that to him.&#148;
	Ami was trying to think of a way to respond, to find a way to let 
Makoto know she definitely wasn&#146;t unwanted, when a small grin tugged at 
the other girl&#146;s lips.  Ami tilted her head to the side in question.
	&#147;He&#146;s moving,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;First time today.&#148;  Her smile 
widened.  &#147;You&#146;re around me more than the others, so I bet he 
recognizes your voice.  He knows you&#146;re here and he wants some 
attention.&#148;
	Ami blushed, at a loss for words.  She felt Makoto&#146;s hand begin 
to move around hers and then stop.  A very vivid sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu hit 
her, and she blushed ever harder.
	&#147;Ummm&#133;  Do you want to?&#148; asked Makoto hesitantly.  She remembered 
all too well what happened the last time she tried this and wasn&#146;t 
going to do it again without permission.
	Ami nodded, and Makoto slowly moved their hands to the round 
bulge in her belly.  She rested Ami&#146;s hand in the right spot, and this 
time Ami could feel fluttery movement under her palm.  The smile this 
caused lit up her entire face and vanquished all the shadows that had 
been chasing Makoto since the day had started.


	From a close distance, through a slight opening in the curtain, 
Kaya watched things play out between the two girls.  Her face was 
neutral, not betraying any of the emotions that were tumbling around 
inside her.
	Quietly, a figure stepped up beside her.  A hand was placed 
discretely against the small of her back, and Kaya found comfort in the 
strength she felt there.
	&#147;I&#146;ve let things go too far, haven&#146;t I?&#148; she asked quietly.
	Ken&#146;s fingers rubbed small circles into Kaya&#146;s back.  &#147;In all 
honesty, Kaya, I don&#146;t think there&#146;s anything you could have done to 
prevent it.  We don&#146;t always get to choose who we love.&#148;
	Kaya sighed sadly.  &#147;Ami&#146;s not going to be able to let go now, 
and when it all falls apart, she&#146;s going to be the one left alone and 
hurt.  It isn&#146;t fair.  And how am I supposed to face her when I&#146;m 
partially to blame?&#148;
	It was a rhetorical question, Ken knew.  Asking these sorts of 
questions was how Kaya worked things out.  So rather than attempt to 
give an answer that wouldn&#146;t have meant anything, he applied just a bit 
more pressure with his hand to let her know he was there for her and 
smiled as she glanced up at him.
	&#147;You look exhausted,&#148; said Ken finally.  &#147;Go home and get some 
rest.  From what I can tell, they&#146;ve got things under control again, 
and it&#146;s your night off.  Try and enjoy it.&#148;
	Kaya nodded.  &#147;I will soon.  I want to wait for the girls.&#148;
	Ken grinned.  &#147;I&#146;m going to check on her now.  It shouldn&#146;t be 
too much longer.&#148;
	Kaya nodded back.  She leaned into his side for just a moment, 
then watched and waited as he went to check on her daughter&#146;s best 
friend.  


*            *            *

	There was a time not too long ago when Usagi had lamented that if 
you sat in class and stared at the clock for long enough, time would 
start to move backwards.  Ami was feeling a bit like that tonight.  She 
glanced at the clock once again, her mind only partially on the lesson 
being taught by her cram school professor.
	They had gotten Makoto home easily enough.  Rei had called Mamoru 
when Minako caught up to her and told her what had happened.  He had 
picked them up on his way to the hospital, and with him there, it gave 
them three drivers.  Ami&#146;s mother had even offered to drive the girls 
back to Makoto&#146;s.  Ami had seen how tired her mother was, though, and 
told her they could handle it on their own.  So, after a quick goodbye 
and a gentle reminder from her mother about class tonight, the group 
had left the hospital.
	Mamoru and Haruka had driven them back to the apartment.  Mamoru 
excused himself early on.  He never seemed completely comfortable in 
the middle of the group of girls, Ami noted.  But he was too much of a 
friend and gentleman to not at least see that Makoto got home safely.
	Ami had left not long after Makoto had been settled in.  
&#145;Settled&#146; was a good word for it, too.  Lying on the couch in her pj&#146;s 
with a blanket forced over her and dinner on the table in front of her, 
Makoto was a semi-unwilling victim of her friends&#146; concern and 
mothering instincts.  Ami was certain the three other girls would have 
taken turns spoon feeding their friend if they felt the task of lifting 
the sandwich and chewing was too strenuous for her.  But Makoto had 
brought it on herself, and she was just going to have to suffer through 
it.
	The movement of the other students gathering their belongings 
snapped Ami&#146;s attention back to the class.  She wasn&#146;t used to her mind 
wandering like this.  Thus, it came as a small shock to realize the 
class had ended and everyone was leaving.  Ami jotted down a few hasty 
notes about the next assignment before the professor could erase the 
board, then followed the last of the stragglers out of the lecture hall.
	Ami was in a hurry to get back to Makoto.  By now, she would have 
learned her lesson and deserved to be rescued.  Ami knew how the rest 
of the night would go, also.  After a short while, the others would 
leave.  Then she and Makoto could sit quietly for a time, and Makoto 
could get some real rest without any disturbances.  It would also give 
Ami time to decide whether she should try and talk the other girl into 
staying home tomorrow, or whether it would be better to have her at 
school where they could keep a closer eye on her.
	Stray thoughts tumbling around in her head, Ami almost missed the 
person waiting for her by the exit.  Ami stopped, more than a little 
surprised, as her mother stood from the bench she&#146;d been sitting on.
	&#147;Mom?&#148; asked Ami.  &#147;What are you doing here?&#148;
	Kaya&#146;s smile was tired as she said, &#147;I thought I&#146;d give you a 
ride home.  It&#146;s pretty cold out tonight, and the weatherman is 
predicting snow.  Though he&#146;s been saying that for the last three 
days,&#148; she said with a light chuckle.  &#147;Come on.  Let&#146;s go home.&#148;
	Ami followed her mother as Kaya walked out of the building.  They 
were in the car, Kaya having just started the engine, when Ami spoke up 
hesitantly, &#147;I&#133; I was going to stay the night at Mako-chan&#146;s.  Because 
of what happened.&#148;
	Kaya was looking straight ahead through the windshield.  Ami saw 
the slight nod and deep breath her mother took before she began to 
speak.  &#147;I know you were planning on that, but&#133;&#148;  Kaya faced her 
daughter then, a small amount of regret visible in her eyes.  &#147;But I 
think it would be best if you stayed home tonight.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s entire body tensed.  She couldn&#146;t help it, the natural 
instinct to fight this warring against the conditioned one to never 
argue with her mother.  After several seconds, Ami swallowed hard.  Her 
eyes dropped as a sort of internal compromise was reached.  &#147;She 
shouldn&#146;t have to be alone,&#148; she said softly.  &#147;I don&#146;t want her to be 
alone.&#148;
	Kaya reached a hand over and placed it on top of Ami&#146;s.  &#147;I know, 
sweetheart.  You&#146;re a good friend to her.  But Makoto has other friends.  
This time, you need to let them take care of her.&#148;
	Slowly, Ami&#146;s eyes rose to meet her mother&#146;s.  Kaya wanted to cry 
for the pain she saw there.  Once again she reminded herself that this 
was ultimately for the best.  Ami needed to put some distance between 
herself and Makoto.  And if a little hurt now would spare her child a 
lot of hurt in the future, then Kaya was willing to play the bad guy 
and be the one who caused it.
	&#147;My things,&#148; said Ami quietly.  &#147;My things are still at Mako-
chan&#146;s.  I&#146;d also like to say goodnight and let her know I&#146;m not 
staying in person.&#148;
	Kaya nodded.  &#147;All right,&#148; she answered.  &#147;I&#146;ll drop you off and 
come back to get you in an hour.&#148;
	&#147;Thank you.&#148;
	On the drive over, Kaya couldn&#146;t shake the slight disappointment 
she felt with her daughter.  When her own parents had told her to stop 
seeing Ami&#146;s father, that he would never amount to anything and would 
only wind up leaving her with a bag full of problems, Kaya had fought 
back hard and won.  This was a bit different, of course, and her own 
accomplishment was nothing to brag about.  Her parents had been right 
for the most part, the only good thing coming from the union being Ami.
	Ami, on the other hand, had just given up.  There was no fight, 
no argument, just the obedience Kaya had always felt blessed to have.  
She should be grateful, shouldn&#146;t she?  This was what she wanted, after 
all.
	Kaya pulled into the apartment complex and parked the car.  She 
stopped Ami before the girl could get out of the car.  &#147;Ami, I love 
you,&#148; said Kaya carefully, hoping Ami would take this for the opening 
she meant it to be.  &#147;You know there isn&#146;t anything you could ever do 
or say that will change that.&#148;
	&#147;I know, Mom,&#148; replied Ami.  &#147;I love you, too.&#148;  Getting out of 
the car and turning back to her mother, she said, &#147;I&#146;ll be ready in an 
hour.&#148;
	Kaya watched until she couldn&#146;t see Ami anymore, then slowly 
pulled away.  There was a diner not too far from here, and a cup of 
coffee would definitely help with the extra hour she was going to have 
to stay awake.

	Ami helped Rei carry the dishes and leftover snacks into the 
kitchen.  Her hour was coming up close, time feeling like it had sped 
up the second she walked through Makoto&#146;s front door.
	Makoto had been so relieved to see her.  Ami could tell just by 
the look on the other girl&#146;s face that she was ready to jump out of her 
skin from all the overattention.  She had pleaded with Ami to assure 
the other three that she wouldn&#146;t fall over dead if they played 
something more exciting than Go Fish.  Or, barring that, to at least 
get them to let her go to the bathroom without an escort.
	Usagi&#146;s father came to pick her up not long after Ami returned.  
It was then that Ami found an opening to tell them she would be leaving 
soon as well.
	After hearing this, Rei volunteered them for clean-up, mostly as 
an excuse to get Ami alone and ask if she was all right.  Thinking it 
would make the other girl feel better about having to leave, Rei 
offered to stay the night in her place.
	&#147;Grandpa won&#146;t have a problem with it,&#148; said Rei as she stood on 
tiptoe to return the box of crackers to the top shelf.  &#147;So don&#146;t look 
so worried, Ami.  She&#146;ll be okay without you for one night.&#148;
	The dishes Ami had been holding clattered hard against the bottom 
of the sink.  Rei turned around to see Ami gripping the edge of the 
sink so hard her knuckles were turning white.  Her head was bowed and 
Rei had to strain to hear her when she spoke.
	&#147;But I don&#146;t want her to be okay without me,&#148; said Ami softly.  
&#147;I want to be the one who takes care of her.  I know it&#146;s selfish, and 
I should just be glad she&#146;s all right and not begrudge her the few real 
friends she has.  I can&#146;t help it, though.  I want her to be mine, and 
only mine.&#148;
	Rei came up behind Ami and laid a hand on her shoulder.  Giving 
it a light squeeze, she said gently, &#147;It&#146;s okay to want that, Ami.  It 
doesn&#146;t mean you&#146;re being selfish.  But if you think it does, then I 
give you permission to be selfish tonight.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s grip loosened just a bit, and Rei saw a single tear run 
down her cheek.  &#147;Why did she do it, Rei?&#148; asked Ami, her voice quiet 
and sad.  &#147;She wasn&#146;t alone.  We were there.  *I* was there.  So why 
did she do it?&#148;
	Rei could only shrug, not having an answer and not thinking it 
would matter even if she did.
	Releasing her grip on the sink, Ami looked from the miko and 
moved several steps away.  She turned back to Rei, her arms wrapped 
tightly around herself.  &#147;I hate her for it sometimes,&#148; said Ami, a 
slight quiver to her words.  &#147;I hate her for feeling like she&#146;s alone 
when we&#146;ve been here, when I&#146;ve been here, for so long.  I hate her for 
going to someone who didn&#146;t care for her at all and giving herself to 
him when I&#146;ve done nothing but care for her without asking for anything 
in return.  I hate that I have to see him everyday.  I hate him for not 
loving her, her for not loving me or wanting me the way I do her, and 
myself for not being able to stop.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s words petered off into a hitched sob.  Rei went over to her 
and put her arms around her as all the tears Ami had kept bottled up 
began to fall.  At a loss for real words, Rei made soft noises at the 
smaller girl like those one would make to a frightened child.
	&#147;I love her so much,&#148; said Ami after several seconds.  &#147;Sometimes 
when I look at her I forget how to breathe because of how she makes me 
feel.&#148;
	&#147;I know, Ami,&#148; said Rei gently as she lightly stroked a hand over 
Ami&#146;s hair.
	Ami shook her head and pulled away from Rei&#146;s embrace.  Swiping 
at her tears with the back of her hand, she said, &#147;No, you don&#146;t, 
because it isn&#146;t just her anymore.  I want Bug, too.  I can almost 
imagine what it will feel like to hold him or what he&#146;ll look like when 
he&#146;s sitting on the kitchen floor banging on her pots and pans with a 
wooden spoon.  And I can imagine what it&#146;s going to feel like the day 
someone takes them away from me.&#148;  Ami&#146;s eyes closed tightly as she 
wrapped her arms back around herself.  &#147;It hurts, Rei.  It hurts,&#148; she 
cried quietly.
	There wasn&#146;t anything Rei could say to this.  None of the false 
assurances that first sprang to her mind would help and would likely 
cause more damage if spoken.  So she simply stood and allowed Ami to 
lean on her and let out as much of the pain as she could.


*            *            *

	Makoto removed her toe from the edge of the kitchen door and let 
it close the fraction she&#146;d been holding it open.  She sagged against 
the wall feeling cold and sick.  &#147;Ami,&#148; she whispered to herself, her 
eyes closing against the tears she felt forming.
	That last &#145;I hate her,&#146; followed by the sounds of Ami crying, had 
been all Makoto could take.  If this wasn&#146;t her own home, she would 
leave and never come back.  Maybe she should do that anyway.  Anything 
to make Ami stop hurting.
	&#147;Hey, Mako-chan, what&#146;s taking so long?&#148; called Minako lightly as 
she came back into the living room.  She stopped short when she saw 
Makoto.  &#147;You okay?&#148; she asked, worry replacing mirth.
	Makoto pushed away from the wall and hurried over to Minako 
before she could get close enough to the kitchen door to hear or be 
heard.  &#147;Yeah, but there aren&#146;t any bulbs in the kitchen,&#148; said Makoto 
as she redirected the blonde back to the hallway.  &#147;We&#146;ll have to take 
one from one of the lamps in the bedroom.&#148;
	Minako regarded the taller girl closely.  &#147;You&#146;re lying.  What&#146;s 
going on?&#148;
	Makoto laughed at the blonde, though it seemed forced in nature.  
&#147;You&#146;re too suspicious.  Come on, because you&#146;re going to have to put 
it in.  Ami hid my stepstool weeks ago, and I still haven&#146;t found it, 
so we&#146;re going to have to use a chair to reach the bathroom light.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m not going to let you start climbing on chairs, Mako-chan,&#148; 
said Minako sternly.
	&#147;I know.  That&#146;s why I said you have to do it,&#148; answered Makoto.  
&#147;Now come on and let&#146;s do this before they get done in the kitchen.  
Otherwise, I&#146;ll tell everyone how you screamed like a little girl when 
the light blew out.&#148;
	Minako frowned at her.  &#147;Some friend you are,&#148; she said.  &#147;And 
after all I&#146;ve done for you, too.&#148;
	As Minako rambled on good naturedly about what a good and 
neglected friend she was, Makoto tried to use her voice as a 
distraction from what was going on in the kitchen.  If it had been 
anyone else who had made Ami cry she would have hunted him down and 
pounded him into the ground.  Makoto had no idea what to do when the 
person she should be beating up was herself.
