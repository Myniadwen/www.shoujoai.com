<h1>I'll Protect You (part 22 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>&#39;I&#39;m riding a car again. It seems that the people around me don&#39;t want 
me to walk, or perhaps they think I am just too weak to do so. I guess 
I&#39;m that fragile. I have so many questions. Questions that even if these 
people around me were able to answer, I would not understand. Up until 
now they won&#39;t tell me how I exactly lost my memory. I guess I need to 
be patient and just do whatever they tell me to do...&#39;

Minako sighed for the twentieth time already since they arrived from the 
airport. She&#39;s sick of hearing her songs from the disc man, sick of her 
being reminded what they will do once they reach the psychiatrist&#39;s 
clinic. She wanted to do something new. Something that will remind her 
of who she is rather than what she was. She noticed her mother fixing 
her pouch bag. She noticed the cell phone her mother bought for her when 
she was in Tokyo. She also noticed another cell phone that was wrapped 
in a re-sealable plastic bag. Minako quickly identified it as her old 
cell phone. The one she used to own

&quot;Mom, can I borrow that cell phone? I want to learn how to use 
it...again&quot; She finally asked

Her mom smiled as she hands the cell phone to Minako, and then she 
continued fixing her daughter&#39;s stuff. Her dad is sleeping while Wendy 
is busy looking at her scheduler. Minako is glad that no one is looking 
at her right now. Ever since the flight they never take their eyes off 
her. Finally she can do whatever she wants to do without being observed. 
She doesn&#39;t want to say it but it makes her feel uncomfortable and 
annoyed

Minako switched on her cell phone. Patiently waiting for her phone to 
load its main screen she saw fifty-three unread messages, twenty-five 
voice messages and sixty-eight unanswered or missed calls. She tried to 
open the messages but she couldn&#39;t recognize any of them. The messages 
mostly asking her how she is doing. Perhaps these people knew what 
happened to her. She gave up on the messages and looked at the pictures. 
Most of them are her pictures, it seems that they&#39;re from different 
places, or countries perhaps

She looks happy on the pictures. She smiled at her self when there are 
funny photos, and got curious on the people who are in it with her. She 
can identify some people by looking on the title at the bottom of the 
picture. She tried to memorize their names in case she met these people 
someday. Then finally she looked at the next picture

The next picture made her blush madly and her heartbeat thumping heavily 
as if it&#39;s about to burst out of her chest

She saw a picture of herself kissing a beautiful raven-haired girl about 
her age. She may not remember anything but she is not dumb to know the 
difference between a friendly kiss and a passionate kiss. The kiss in 
the picture is so hot that it&#39;s making her sweat by just looking at it. 
She shook her head, composed herself and proceeded to the next picture. 
But the thought of changing the subject did not help on lessening the 
blush on her face

She saw the perfect image of the mystery girl she was kissing on the 
previous picture. The girl&#39;s eyes were closed on the last picture. But 
this time it revealed a pair of unreadable amethyst eyes, pale white 
skin matched with crimson lips and long raven black hair. She noticed 
the name of the picture is labeled &quot;Rei-chan&quot;

&quot;Rei...chan...&quot; Minako whispered absentmindedly

Wendy could have sworn she heard Minako say Rei&#39;s name. She turned her 
head to look at Minako

&quot;What did you say?&quot; Wendy asked carefully

Minako snapped back to reality and looked at Wendy

&quot;What?&quot; Said the former singer as she immediately closes her cell phone

&quot;You mentioned something...a name to be exact&quot; The manager remembered 
she can&#39;t mention Rei&#39;s name because she made a promise that she will 
not speak of the raven-haired girl until Minako remembers everything

&quot;Who is it dear?&quot; Her mother got curious as well

&quot;N-nothing! I was just playing with my cell phone to kill some time. I 
got carried away I guess&quot; Minako said smiling a bit

&#39;I&#39;m sorry mom, Ms. Wendy. I don&#39;t know why but I have a feeling that I 
need to hide this matter from everyone. I noticed it from the start that 
they&#39;ve been hiding something from me. Something that might have to do 
with the girl from the picture I guess. I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll do my own 
investigations as well&#39;

&quot;Oh, I see. It&#39;s probably just my imagination&quot; Wendy sighed and 
continued what she&#39;s doing

Minako for some reason became a little lively with her idea and started 
to look outside the car window and dreamily stared at the sceneries

--

--Inside the Mall--

&quot;Come on cop girl, try to pick something. People are starting to stare 
at me when I try to pick a dress for you! They must be thinking I&#39;m a 
cross-dresser or something!&quot; Grey pouted at Rei who is looking blankly 
on the other side of the shop

&quot;As long as Rei is here they won&#39;t think that way&quot; Edward laughed as he 
lifts a black nightgown

Rei finally looked back at the two handsome men who are now arguing. She 
sighed and looked at the line of gowns with disinterest. Finally she 
took two simple ones and gave it to Grey

&quot;Here. I picked something. I&#39;ll be just on the other side, I want to buy 
a television&quot; Rei said as she walks outside the boutique, leaving a 
speechless Grey

&quot;Well, you can follow us once you&#39;ve paid for the dress. Make sure you 
don&#39;t lose your way&quot; Edward said as he catches up with the raven-haired 
girl

&quot;W-what?&quot; Grey asked as he looks at the dress he is holding. He saw a 
group of young girls giggling at him. He immediately runs on the counter 
and pays for the dress

Rei looked inside the appliances shop. The sales people immediately 
approached her as if she is a very important customer

&quot;Good day madam! Welcome to the appliances shop. How can we assist you?&quot; 
Greeted the young salesman

&quot;Can you please help me pick a television set?&quot; Rei asked as Edward 
enters the store and was greeted by giggling sales girls

&quot;Of course madam, this way please!&quot; replied the salesman with enthusiasm 
as he places his arm on Rei&#39;s back. Edward noticed this and walks beside 
Rei. He darted a threatening look at the salesman

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to interrupt your excellent accommodation but will you please 
keep your hands away from my friend&quot; Edward started, the young salesman 
finally noticed the handsome man&#39;s threatening look and quickly removed 
his hands from Rei&#39;s gray fur coat and bowed down

&quot;My apologies madam, monsieur!&quot; He said nervously. Rei felt sorry for 
him

&quot;You don&#39;t have to give him that look, this a public place. They are 
just being nice&quot; Rei whispered as they proceeded to walk at the 
television section

&quot;Mark has entrusted me your safety. For me, safety means no one can lay 
hands on even the very strand of your hair&quot; Edward explained

&quot;That&#39;s over reacting. You could have proven that when we were saving 
her&quot; Rei simply said as she starts to look at the television display. 
Rei may not notice or care but Edward was a bit hurt on what she said, 
he knew she was talking about Minako. The handsome man sighed as he 
follows the raven haired girl

&quot;I guess you&#39;re still mad at me because of that&quot; He whispered as places 
his hand at the top of a display TV. Rei didn&#39;t mean to say that, 
instead of apologizing she chooses to stay silent and continued looking 
at the displays. Finally Grey made his way inside the appliance store

&quot;Hey, how long are you going to stay here? I&#39;m not a shopping bag 
assistant now am I?&quot; Grey asked sarcastically as he lifts Rei&#39;s shopping 
bags

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask you to come here with us. And if you don&#39;t want to carry 
those shopping bags then I&#39;ll carry it!&quot; Rei said as she grabs the 
shopping bags from Grey who was taken aback

&quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t ask you to carry it!&quot;

&quot;Then why are you complaining?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not complaining!&quot;

&quot;Just give me those bags!&quot;

&quot;Your arm is broken!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to remind me!&quot;

Edward sighed and took a piece of white feather from his coat pocket and 
wiped it on his face. Grey surely gets along with Rei. She finally 
purchased a 21 inch flat screen TV. Grey had it shipped on their private 
plane. They dropped by to a bookstore to buy some books. Finally they 
went back to Edinburgh to where Sanctorium is

--

--At Minako&#39;s Condo, London--

Minako&#39;s mood changed again as they wait for the elevator to reach 37th 
floor of the building, where her condo unit is located at

&quot;We&#39;re staying here for the rest of the afternoon. Feel free to do 
anything you want. This place is yours, Minako&quot; Wendy said

Minako looked around. It&#39;s a very huge condo unit, not to mention 
elegant. Walls are surrounded with cream colored curtains. Carpet floor 
and breeze-scented air freshener, the other side of the wall where it&#39;s 
not covered by curtains hung Minako&#39;s achievements: Platinum and gold 
awards, trophies aligned on top of a long table covered with cream 
colored table cover matched with rest of the curtains in the living 
room. Minako has not seen her room yet. But no matter how elegant her 
room or her condo unit is, she can&#39;t appreciate it for some reason

&quot;Ms. Wendy, which way is my room? I wanted to rest&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s behind that door&quot; Wendy pointed the door on the right side of 
the room. Minako looked at her parents, her mom knew what that look 
meant

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about us honey. We&#39;ve been here once. And we&#39;re going to 
rest once Ms. Wendy and I finished talking okay?&quot; Mrs. Aino said as she 
pushes her daughter gently towards her room. Minako nodded but took her 
old cell phone before entering inside her room

&quot;If you&#39;re bored you can watch television&quot; Mr. Aino reminded. Minako 
nodded silently then closed the door of her room

The former singer lazily lays her back on her soft queen sized bed. She 
sighed and looked at the ceiling for about five minutes

&#39;I know why I&#39;m here at the first place. But it feels like I need to 
rediscover some things. Things that even Ms. Wendy and my parents forgot 
to mention. Perhaps they don&#39;t want me to think too much. But the more 
they hide things the more I become desperate to find it out&#39;

Minako opened her cell phone once again. She looked for the picture 
where she&#39;s kissing the mysterious raven-haired girl. She couldn&#39;t help 
but blush every time she looks at it

&quot;Rei-chan...Did mom and dad or Ms. Wendy know I had a girlfriend? Then 
that would make me a homosexual, right?&quot; She said to herself

&#39;But...&#39;

&quot;...Why isn&#39;t she here with me right now? Why is she not there when I 
woke up? Isn&#39;t she going to be worried if I&#39;m in this condition right 
now? So many questions...&quot; She tried to look for Rei&#39;s name on the 
messages, voice messages and missed calls she received but none of them 
says anything about Rei. She looked on the date when the picture was 
taken, it was just weeks ago when she took the picture

&#39;If this picture was just recently taken, then we still have that kind 
of relationship, right?&#39;

Minako hoped too much. She suddenly frowns when she realized something

&quot;...I forgot. I&#39;m here in Europe, and she is probably in Japan...&quot; Her 
eyes slowly closed as tears fall down her pale cheeks. She doesn&#39;t why 
but she&#39;s in pain. She looked at the image of Rei and hugged her cell 
phone as she cries

&quot;Rei...I can&#39;t remember you but I can feel your love for me...I wish you 
were here...&quot; She cried for a few minutes, feeling hopeless. An idea 
struck her mind and she rises up on her bed. She ran towards the door 
and opened it. She saw her parents talking to Wendy on the living room

&quot;M-Minako? I thought you wanted to rest? What&#39;s wrong? Honey are you 
crying?&quot; Mrs. Aino asked as she stands up and approached her daughter&#39;s 
sweaty face

&quot;Did you have a nightmare?&quot; Wendy asked worriedly as she follows Mrs. 
Aino

Minako looked desperately at Wendy

&quot;Ms. Wendy!&quot;

&quot;W-what is it?&quot; Wendy asked, a little nervous at how Minako is looking 
at her

&quot;...W-who...Who is...&quot;

--

--Rei at Sanctorium--

&quot;Welcome back Ms. Rei. Did you have fun today?&quot; greeted Minerva, the 
nurse who is taking care of Rei

Rei nodded at her and she proceeded to walk her back to her room. 
Minerva looked at her then turned her attention to Edward and then to 
Grey who seemed to look pissed

&quot;Hey Minerva, will you do a check-up on that crazy girl? She&#39;s been hot 
headed all morning!&quot; Grey sat down to the nearest sofa and rested his 
head contently

&quot;Y-yes master Grey!&quot; Minerva was startled when Edward puts his hand on 
her shoulder

&quot;Just ignore him. He just couldn&#39;t accept that he&#39;s been bossed around 
by a girl&quot; Edward whispered and winked at her

Minerva just nodded

&quot;By the way, make sure that she will have her rest this afternoon 
because we are all going out this evening. I told her to wear the night 
gown she wanted the best&quot; He added

--

--Evening at Sanctorium--

&quot;Party? Tonight!? I thought the party is tomorrow night?&quot; Henry, the 
blondish white-haired member of Sanctuary asked in surprise

&quot;Yes, yes. It is tonight indeed. They actually adjusted the date in 
purpose because they are avoiding people like us. But you see, we&#39;re 
Sanctuary&quot; Mark said confidently and then looked at Rei

&quot;Hino-chan, I&#39;m pretty sure you had your rest this afternoon. Can you 
lend us your time for this evening&#39;s plan?&quot; All five handsome men looked 
at her

&quot;...Tell me what to do&quot;

--

--Minako&#39;s condo in London--

&quot;...Who is what Minako?&quot; Wendy nervously asked

&#39;Who is Rei?? Where is she!? What is she to me??&#39; Minako&#39;s mind screamed

&quot;...Who is...My Psychiatrist...?&quot; Minako was breathing heavily

&#39;Why? Why can&#39;t I say her name in front of them??&#39;

Wendy sighed in relief. She thought it was someone important Minako had 
remembered

&quot;You&#39;re Psychiatrist&#39;s name is Dr. Claude O&#39; Farell. I don&#39;t see why you 
asked but I don&#39;t think that would mean anything to you&quot; Wendy said. 
Mrs. Aino is rubbing her daughter&#39;s back gently

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry if I had you worried all of a sudden...I&#39;m just desperate 
to bring back my memories. It won&#39;t happen again. I&#39;ll go back to my 
room&quot; Minako said weakly and turns back to her room

&quot;Do you want me to stay beside you honey?&quot; Her mom asked. Minako shook 
her head and smiled

&quot;I&#39;m fine, mom. Thanks for the offer. You can continue what you&#39;re 
doing&quot; Then she finally closes the door behind then once again

&quot;I&#39;m afraid we need to adjust her appointment to an earlier time 
tomorrow&quot; Wendy said worriedly as she takes out her pocket scheduler

--

Back to her room Minako sat on her bed, breathless and sweating. She 
couldn&#39;t explain what happened awhile ago

&#39;I must be exaggerating. I&#39;ve discovered some things I can&#39;t believe had 
happened. Is it just my imagination?&#39;

--Former Cabinet Member&#39;s Evening Party--

Influential people from all over London were invited to witness the 
birthday celebration of a former cabinet member. The party is currently 
held in one of the former cabinet member&#39;s mansion. Each former member 
are giving their respective speech

Meanwhile standing by at the very rooftop of the mansion where the party 
is being held are Mark, Leonard and Rei silently listening

&quot;How promising. I bet their secretaries worked all night for that 
speech&quot; Leonard said as he busies himself to his laptop. He is wearing a 
tuxedo, his thin blue hair brushed neatly on the left side. And he&#39;s 
wearing a pair of head phones that is used to clearly hear what&#39;s going 
on inside the mansion

Rei as usual is staring blankly out of nowhere. She is now wearing a 
nightgown but it&#39;s not the one she bought that morning. Her long 
backless nightgown is an abstract purple and black combination. The 
length is up to her feet and is brushing on the floor carelessly. It has 
slit that reaches above her knee exposing her smooth legs and plain 
high-heeled shoes. Her hair is on a tight bun on the back of her head, 
an earpiece attached on her left ear with a dangling diamond ear ring. 
Her amethyst eyes almost glowing in the dark. Mark grabbed the 
opportunity to talk to her

&quot;The celebrant who is going to do the last speech is the one who hired 
the assassin Mr. Shards to kill my Parents. I have strong evidences, but 
I have chosen not to use justice. What we&#39;re doing tonight is just a 
step towards their fall down, the ones who are involved in our parent&#39;s 
death&quot; He said coldly that made Rei shiver

&quot;So even after I told you that revenge is pointless you still wanted to 
continue?&quot; Rei looked at him. Mark doesn&#39;t look angry or sad. Instead 
Rei can see pure determination in his crimson eyes

&quot;Mark, Ed said that he&#39;s next&quot; the young Leonard said, referring to 
their main target

&quot;Very well, everything&#39;s smooth so far. We&#39;ll just have to wait for him 
to finish the speech I&#39;ve edited for him. Tell Henry to prepare the 
chopper after fifteen minutes!&quot; Mark smirked

&quot;Will do&quot; Leonard replied as he works back on his laptop

&quot;Hino-chan, switch on the spotlight on the bottom at the back after my 
signal&quot;

&quot;Okay&quot;

--

--Inside the Mansion--

The celebrant proudly walks in the middle of the crowd carrying a glass 
of red whine to start his celebration speech. The old man started with a 
short story about his life when he was a politician. After that his 
assistant gave him his script and started his speech:

&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen

Here I stand in front of you. Ludwig Duckheimer IV, the name my great 
ancestor entrusted me, had done many accomplishments in life. I had 
spent 30 years of undying loyalty and pride. I hope I can live another 
30 more years so that I can pass this pride to my great grandchildren as 
well...&quot;

The speech continues and only few sentences left. The celebrant was into 
the script, confident that he will make a proud applause from these 
people

&quot;After fighting a silent war, we have surpassed this great obstacle. I 
could have not survived this if it were not for the people who cared for 
me. These people are here with us right now. My dear guests, I proudly 
introduce you, Sanctuary&#39;s Sixth Member!...W-what!?&quot;

The Former Cabinet member celebrant became pale white on what he just 
announced from the script he was reading. He surely recognize Sanctuary, 
and they were messing with his party all along

&quot;Sa-Sanctuary!? Sanctuary is here??&quot; He shouted in a nervous tone. He 
looked all over inside his mansion where his eyes can reach. His 
bodyguards surrounded him and they started to walk in the back entrance 
of his mansion. But before they can reach it a loud bang was heard. All 
the lights inside his mansion were switched off. Now it pitch black 
inside

The guests started to walk out of the mansion. The others, out of fear 
grabbed the nearest body they can feel and grab and followed them 
outside the mansion. Even the lights outside the mansion were turned off 
but it&#39;s not so dark compared inside

--

--Mansion Rooftop--

&quot;They&#39;re outside I guess...Hino-chan, the light&quot; Mark commanded. Red 
switched the spot light on and a bright light was seen at the rooftop 
middle of the celebrant&#39;s mansion. Edward, Henry, and Grey managed to 
arrive at the top in time for their show. Mark held a speaker and walked 
to the edge of the rooftop in front. On his both sides were the four 
original members of Sanctuary

&quot;GREETINGS, DUCKHEIMER. IT&#39;S BEEN AWHILE SINCE WE LAST SAW YOU. I SEE 
THAT YOU ARE ENJOYING YOUR LIFE ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPT I RE-MADE FOR 
YOU!&quot; Said Mark on the speaker box

&quot;You people again!! I thought you&#39;re finished chasing me! I never 
invited you here!!&quot; Shouted Mr. Duckheimer, his body guards alertly 
pointing their guns to where Mark and the others are. But they can&#39;t see 
their faces because the limited reach of the spot light keeps them from 
seeing the five men&#39;s face

&quot;YOU KNOW US BUT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN TO INVITE US. HOW 
DISHEARTENING...ANYWAYS, THE REASON WHY WE&#39;RE HERE IS BECAUSE WE DON&#39;T 
WANT TO WASTE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE OUR SIXTH MEMBER&quot; Mark 
stepped aside a bit and gives way to Rei. Her sudden exposure to the 
people below released a cold aura that made them gasp

What people can see below is ghost-like image of a beautiful young woman 
in a nightgown, pale white skin and nothing else since her face was 
impossible to see with the distance

&quot;W-wha-what about your newest member!? I do not give a damn if you had 
added another member!! Get out of this place now!!&quot; Shouted the 
celebrant, he looked at his guest to find them one by one escaping using 
their cars and limousines. Some took a picture and video of what&#39;s 
happening using their camera phones

&quot;Stop! Don&#39;t take any pictures!&quot; He shouted again waving his hands 
madly. Afraid of the embarrassing situation he is into

&quot;LOOKS LIKE WE&#39;RE BACK IN BUSINESS. I&#39;M LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR NEXT 
MEETING. WE WILL SILENTLY OBSERVE AND MOVE AFTER THIS. DON&#39;T EXPECT TO 
SEE MORE OF US!&quot; After that the spot light at their back just went off. 
There was a cold silence after that. The celebrant&#39;s bodyguards stayed 
beside Mr. Duckheimer and the other guards started to search the area 
for any traces of Sanctuary

Mr. Duckheimer grabbed his advisor&#39;s collar rather aggressively. The 
former politician is sweating a pig

&quot;What do we do, Mr. Duckheimer?&quot; His advisor asked

&quot;Tell everyone to keep this information limited as much as possible, 
they&#39;ve exposed enough. Make sure that the media won&#39;t get any further 
details! This will affect my candidate&#39;s reputation!&quot; He said and the 
advisor nodded and runs inside the mansion

--

--Minako&#39;s Condo--

Minako couldn&#39;t sleep well. She can&#39;t stop thinking about things. She 
looked at Rei&#39;s picture on her cell phone again

&quot;Rei...do you even exist?&quot;
