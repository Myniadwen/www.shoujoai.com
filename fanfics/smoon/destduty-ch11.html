<h1>Destiny or Duty (part 11 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/destduty-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Rei waited patiently as Usagi dressed, staring at the picture of the two 
of them that the blonde kept on her dresser.  She stood and picked up 
the framed picture, sensing that something was very, very wrong.  
Glancing at the flowery candle Usagi had burning on the dresser, Rei 
closed her eyes and whispered a short prayer.  She felt something flow 
through her, something powerful, and she opened her eyes, staring at the 
picture.  It had changed.  Now Chiba Mamoru was standing there, Usagi 
smiling in his arms, an aura surrounding both of them.  She blinked, and 
they changed . . . Usagi was dressed in a white gown, a golden crescent 
moon on her forehead, and Mamoru was dressed as a prince.  Her prince.  
Usagi&#39;s prince.

Rei gasped and fell back, dropping the picture and watching it bounce on 
the carpet.  The flame blew out, a thin whiff of smoke reaching for the 
ceiling as Usagi stepped out of the bathroom.  &quot;Rei?  What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
 
&quot;Something&#39;s wrong,&quot; Rei whispered, glancing out the window.  A tall 
woman dressed in a black dress shining red in the tiny spots of sunlight 
that filtered through the leaves, was standing in the tree, long green 
hair waving in the wind, garnet eyes ancient and all-knowing.  She bowed 
and vanished, leaving the miko staring blankly into an empty tree.  &quot;I 
think someone is messing with reality.  My visions tell me things that I 
don&#39;t see, that aren&#39;t real, but I think they were real once.  Something 
happened, someone changed our world, and I wish I could see who did it . 
. .&quot;
 
&quot;I know who did it,&quot; Usagi whispered, reaching for the black cat 
sleeping on her bed.  Luna mrrowed and curled up in her mistress&#39;s arms, 
falling back to sleep.  &quot;I saw her, in my mind, when I felt that pain.  
I saw the woman with aqua hair, but I also saw Her.&quot;
 
&quot;Who?  What does she look like?&quot;
 
&quot;There was a slender woman with purple eyes and silvery white hair.  Her 
hair was long and feathery, and she seemed to have a gold star in the 
center of her forehead.  Or maybe it was a slender horn.  It was very 
indistinct.  She was wearing a white dress that seemed to have markings 
on the hem.  Priestess markings, prayers, symbols of power in gold.  She 
had long fingers, fingernails painted gold, and I think she had wings.  
Feathered wings.  There was someone else, behind her, a friend or a 
partner, I suppose.  She was powerful and old, her red eyes the only 
indication of her age, and she had green hair.&quot;
 
&quot;I saw the woman with green hair,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;We need to talk to 
her.&quot;
 
&quot;Right now we need to go to Aino Minako&#39;s concert,&quot; Usagi pointed out, 
placing Luna back on the bed.  That cat had a crescent moon mark on her 
forehead.  Rei looked up, banishing her vision from her mind as she 
smiled at Usagi&#39;s dress.  The blonde blushed.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;You don&#39;t look only fifteen.  I may 
have trouble keeping my eyes on the stage.&quot;  Usagi blushed as Rei 
wrapped her arms around the blonde&#39;s waist, leading her out of the 
house.  Luna looked up as they vanished, glancing out the window as a 
woman with silver hair and white wings appeared in the tree.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Tejina shook her head.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I can&#39;t do anything.  I only have a 
limited amount of power.  I was able to create this reality, but I don&#39;t 
think I can undo it.&quot;
 
&quot;Damn you!  Who the hell do you think you are, meddling with destiny 
like this?!&quot;  Cupid 334 Omicron clenched her fists, glancing at her 
former apprentice seated on the branch beside her.  &quot;Those girls are 
senshi, reborn princesses of the Silver Millennium, destined to fight 
the evil threatening this planet.&quot;
 
&quot;There is no evil,&quot; Tejina pointed out.  &quot;I got rid of it for this 
reality.  That was part of her wish.  There is no evil, and there are no 
senshi.&quot;
 
&quot;And soulmates are separated!  Do you know the damage you have done?!  
Certain things were mean to happen that haven&#39;t!  Usagi is dating Rei, 
Minako is singing songs about loneliness and love, Ami is still shy and 
frightened at a time when she should be more confident and knowledgeable 
about her own power, Makoto still has strength and power she does not 
yet understand, and Mamoru still lays in his bed at night and asks who 
he is and who he belongs with.  Why would you do this?  What possible 
reason could you have for thwarting the powers and the duties of the 
Cupid Alliance?&quot;
 
&quot;For my mother,&quot; Tejina whispered.  &quot;Because she asked me to help.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re . . .&quot;  Cupid 334 looked up as a tall woman with long green hair 
and red eyes appeared beside Tejina, dressed in flowing black robes 
covered in red symbols that both Cupids recognized.  &quot;Se,&quot; she 
whispered, all of her anger leaving her.  &quot;Why would you do this to 
them?  You were one of them, you love them all, yet you took their power 
and their destiny away.  Why?&quot;
 
Se, called Meiou Setsuna on Earth, glanced at Rei and Usagi as they 
walked to the nearest bus stop and the concert.  &quot;Because I have seen 
what that power does.  I have seen the pain and sacrifice and death.  
And because Haruka needed this.  Michiru needed this.  After betraying 
all that they held dear, neither of them are sure that anything in this 
life is real.  Love, truth, trust, hope, loyalty . . . none of those 
words mean anything to them anymore.  They&#39;re scared and confused and 
they have doubts about their power and their mission.  They need to see 
this.&quot;
 
&quot;Do they all have to suffer?&quot;
 
Se hung her head at Cupid 557&#39;s question.  &quot;She begged me for this 
chance.  She begged me for an answer.  This was the only answer I could 
give.&quot;
 
&quot;Se, can&#39;t you see the damage you&#39;re doing?&quot;
 
&quot;I was born to do damage,&quot; she whispered, staring at her hands.  &quot;Haruka 
once saw blood on her hands, once recognized the destruction she had 
caused, but she had no idea what true damage, true pain was.  I know 
what she&#39;s going through because I went through it, too, but I lost my 
chosen love.  I lost everyone and everything I ever cared about because 
I let them die, I let them suffer, I did nothing to stop the coming 
apocalypse.  The greatest coalition of kingdoms that ever spanned this 
solar system was eliminated in an instant, and I did nothing to save 
them.  I cannot go back and see if I made the correct choice, but I can 
give her this chance.  Tejina has the power to alter reality, so I 
helped her rewind time and change destiny.  Now we can do nothing but 
see how this turns out.&quot;
 
&quot;If all the senshi don&#39;t die in the process.&quot;  Cupid 557 crossed his 
arms over his chest and glared at the goddess.  &quot;Se, I commend your love 
for these mortals, but Haruka and Michiru are the only two who were 
united as planned.  And Michiru was never meant to be raped.  Have you 
done more harm than good?&quot;

&quot;I never meant for that to happen,&quot; Se whispered.  &quot;But I cannot stop 
this.  None of us have the power to reset reality.  Michiru will recover 
physically, and Haruka will help her heal emotionally.  Until then, we 
can do nothing.&quot;
 
557 shook his head.  &quot;I never thought I could doubt Hades&#39;s daughter.&quot;  
374&#39;s silence was the only indication of her disapproval.  Tejina sighed 
and closed her purple eyes.  She never wanted Michiru harmed, but 
Haruka&#39;s wish was irreversible.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; Minako smiled, her energy transferred to her fans.  
&quot;There&#39;s just one more song I&#39;d like to sing for you tonight.  It&#39;s 
dedicated to my soulmate, whenever I find him or her, and to all of my 
old girlfriends and boyfriends.  It&#39;s a song I wrote called &quot;Setsunakute 
ii, and I hope you like it.&quot;
 
The famous idol stepped back from the edge of the stage as her band 
began to play, the music fast and upbeat, a smile on the blonde&#39;s face 
as she began.
 
Hey, as I sleep in the night, I can hear you,
And once more, I remember you . . .
 
Ah, opening the pale window
I lift my eyes to the sky, to the planet turning.
 
For you, I&#39;ll be good
And I&#39;ll wear a red ribbon.
 
From the distance, alone
I watch for someone to call my own.
 
How long till I exchange emptiness for love?
In case your spirit
Is alone, I&#39;ll stand alone . . .
 
Hey, through the window, I want to be
With you and hold you in my slender arms . . .
 
And at once, if you&#39;re ever threatened and cry
Surely, I&#39;ll run to you and end it.
 
The suit of your spirit is in my heart
And in the distance I can see your profile.
 
My love will never change but
Becomes more like you and
Is in your name, I&#39;ll stand in your name . . .
 
From the distance, I hold
And watch for someone to call my own.
 
How long till I exchange emptiness for love?
In case your spirit
Is alone, I&#39;ll stand alone.
 
Minako replaced her microphone on its stand and bowed her head as the 
crowd cheered, one small section louder than the rest.  Usagi knew that 
woman, and she cried out as loudly as she could, hoping that Minako 
would look at her.  Rei also cried out, a sense of destiny pulling her 
toward the singer.  She felt like the blonde belonged with them, was one 
of them, and she knew that Makoto and Ami felt it, too.  Even Mamoru, 
who was silently watching Usagi, knew that Minako did not belong on that 
stage, a teen idol.  She belonged in the crowd, with her friends, 
cheering for another famous singer.
 
The crowd dispersed as Minako left the stage, the show over, many of 
them hoping for a glimpse of the famous singer.  Usagi grabbed Rei&#39;s 
hand and dragged her toward the door, stopping beside the largest tree 
beside the stage where they had agreed to meet after the concert.  
Makoto and Ami joined them a few minutes later, Mamoru hanging back as 
he sensed that something was keeping him out of the group.
 
&quot;Mamoru-san, won&#39;t you join us?&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you, Usagi-san.&quot;  Mamoru joined the group as a discrete cough 
sounded from behind the tree.  The group of girls turned as a slender 
blonde in an expensive golden dress stepped into the soft moonlight and 
the harsh glow of the streetlights, her blue eyes locking with Usagi&#39;s.
 
&quot;I saw you five in the crowd,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I could feel this power 
calling me, coming from you.  Do we know each other?&quot;
 
&quot;We know you,&quot; Usagi answered, a strange maturity in her voice.  &quot;I 
think . . . you&#39;re one of us, Aino Minako.  Or you were, once.  My name 
is Tsukino Usagi, and these are my friends.  Hino Rei, Kino Makoto, 
Mizuno Ami, and Chiba Mamoru.  You were amazing.  Especially that last 
song.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks.  I wrote it myself and I wrote most of the music.  I let my 
band add the second and third level instruments, but the idea was mine.  
I had a dream one night about a redhead princess and I had a feeling 
that she and I were destined.  So I wrote the song.  She had a fiery 
temper and the most amazing purple eyes . . . I want to find her in this 
life.  I know that she&#39;s the One.&quot;  She looked up at Rei, feeling a 
flash of something, shaking her head when the miko raised an eyebrow.  
&quot;I feel like I know all of you already.  Do you think we met in a 
previous life?&quot;
 
&quot;Perhaps.  Aino-san, if you&#39;re not busy right now, the five of us had 
planned to go to a restaurant for supper.  We&#39;d be honored if you would 
join us.&quot;
 
&quot;Please, Usagi-san, call me Minako.  Aino-san is my mother, not me.  
Would you really let me join you?&quot;
 
&quot;Of course!&quot;  As the group walked away, Se watched them from the trees, 
twirling her Time Staff around and watching the light glint from deep 
inside the garnet stone.  Three white feathers floated down from the sky 
and caught in her hair as two silent Cupids watched from the ground.  
They would not speak back to the goddess, but their anger colored the 
air and the ground, flowers wilting at their feet.  The Cupid Alliance 
would file a formal complaint the next day, but it didn&#39;t worry Se.  
Haruka and Michiru were her best friends in the entire world, and they 
deserved a chance to know for sure.
 
Even if her wish killed all of the other senshi.</pre>
