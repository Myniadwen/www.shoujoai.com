Hi!

I hope you are all well but I guess you are, since we are still 
alive... Alright, that was pointless. What you have in front of you 
are recordings of what happened in the first timeline, before that 
little brat of a daughter decided to play Timecop. Why we are still 
remembering it? I have no idea, I&#39;m not Pluto after all. But the 
memories are dual. We have yours up to some point and we have our 
old, maybe the two timelines are drifting apart and there will be two 
different futures with only slight differences or they&#39;ll just blend 
or... But, as I said, I&#39;m not Pluto and she claims not to know 
anything either.
	This is sort of a present from us for you, for your efforts 
to train Usa-chan. My daughter has evolved into a fine princess and a 
splen... splend... splendid warrior. Yeah, that&#39;s what I wanted to 
say. Don&#39;t look at me like this, Mars! Anyway, Usa is coming to visit 
you soon for a final time and will bring you these journals. As much 
as this is a gift for you, it is also important for us. We thought it 
would be a shame that all the memories of the old days would at one 
point or another just disappear and so we sat down to recollect and 
retell what happened in the original Past that we remember.
	The files are a collection of documents, diary entries from 
this time and memory crystal recording. I&#39;m sure Ami can figure most 
of that out. Don&#39;t be confused, a lot is different than you remember 
it being. After Beryl and Metallia were defeated our Senshi 
personalities slept on for two whole years, including the repeated 
one. There were no Ail and Ann to combat, so we had a peaceful life 
for a long time.
	That&#39;s enough for an introduction. I hope you enjoy reading 
our tales as much as we enjoy rewriting them. Believe us the pleasure 
is with us.

Ja ne, yours

 Usagi, the Queen :)

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

The night air was cool and the full moon hung in the sky, 
illuminating the area in an, eerie display of dimness and shadows. An 
old owl was making noises and other nocturnal active animals chimed 
in. The building in front of me was dark and all the lights were out, 
its inhabitants already gone after the day&#39;s work was done. Nobody 
suspected what lay beneath the insignificant &quot;Crown Game Center&quot;, 
nobody except a pair of cats and I.
	Who am I? Well, I&#39;m the famous Sailor V, the last remaining 
Sailor Senshi awake in this world due to circumstances as much 
traumatic as revealing that I would rather not like to talk or think 
about them. I had returned here at a very worried call from my 
guardian, which I suspected would come sooner or later. Although the 
latter would have been better, after two months of observing and 
investigating the activities of the dormant darkness brewing, it 
became clear that the inevitable would occur soon. The stars were in 
perfect alignment, and while I certainly was not Nephrite, I could 
tell that all signs pointed out the obvious, the obvious for someone 
involved that is. Astronomers had predicted cloudy nights for the 
last few days and yet during the Full Moon period, there was not even 
one cloud in the sky.
	Silently I slipped through the door - that certainly was not 
left open by the workers at the game center - and continued towards a 
particular game that was very popular these days - a game starring 
myself. Pushing a hidden button, the machine suddenly gave way to 
stairs with a loud sound that would have attracted a lot of noise, if 
the area here wasn&#39;t usually less populated at night. A few moments 
later, I reached a large room, packed full with computers, screens 
and strange Hi-Tech equipment. Seated on one of the chairs in front 
of a screen were two small cats, a black one and a white one, both 
bore a golden crescent moon mark on the forehead.
	&quot;You are late,&quot; announced the black one with a stern 
expression upon seeing me enter the hidden communication center. I 
smiled apologetically. &quot;Gomen, Luna. I had to drop off Hotaru at home 
first.&quot; The cat&#39;s eyes narrowed for a moment, then she nodded 
reluctantly after an exasperated look from the white cat. Artemis, my 
partner, knew the whole story behind my reawakening and understood, 
much better than his female counterpart, the strange relationship 
that bound me to the raven-haired girl. After two months, Luna still 
hadn&#39;t gotten used to it, yet I could not really say I blamed her. 
Everyone not present at the events would have suspicions, especially 
with our lasting silence.
	Dismissing the issue, Luna turned around towards a screen 
showing an area of the town. &quot;The mystical energy we detected is 
gathering around this area. It is beyond doubt time. Tomorrow will be 
the time of the reawakening.&quot; I nodded sadly. It was bound to happen 
sooner or later, I knew that as well as the two cats. That didn&#39;t 
mean, though, that I had to like it. Bad enough that I was involved 
in this fight yet again. But I could deal with that. I had earlier, 
during my first period as Sailor V and the events a few months ago 
showed that I was more than capable of taking care of things myself. 
That was when I identified the exact area the monitor outlined, and I 
frowned visibly. &quot;That IS the track course, you know?&quot; Artemis sighed 
and shook his head, &quot;It&#39;s not that there is much that isn&#39;t in some 
way covered tomorrow, you know.&quot;
	&quot;Exactly. That is why we cannot afford for you to 
participate. Fake an injury or something. The possibility of a wide-
spread attack is too high to have you exhausted.&quot; Facing the concept 
of having my two months of training nullified, my mind worked 
incredibly fast. What Luna said was true. If all the signs were 
right, then the chances were by ninety-nine percent that something 
like that would happen, however, all the training would have been 
wasted and more time spent with Hotaru instead. I would not let the 
enemy interrupt my day of success.
	&quot;This is not necessary. Raven can recharge me in the blink of 
an eye, if necessary. And I know her too well to talk her out of 
joining me at the festival anyway.&quot; Not after the time I sacrificed 
for this year&#39;s Taiiku no hi. Last year&#39;s had been the thirtieths 
celebration of the Olympics being held in 1964 and I had missed it... 
twice. First for being a Senshi and the second time because of the 
same suggestion Luna just made. Only that the injury wasn&#39;t faked.
	There was a short contest of wills, as my resolve battled 
with the black cat&#39;s - Artemis wisely chose to remain silent -, 
finally the feline sighed in defeat and turned around to face the 
computer station again. &quot;As you wish. I just hope nothing happens 
during your race.&quot; That really would be unpleasant... For whoever 
dared to disturb my chance of impressing some more meaningful people.
	Before either of us could make any more comments, a beeping 
noise attracted all of our attention. I pressed a button at one of 
the communication consoles that was linked with the more interstellar 
sensors. There was only one out in space who could be contacting us 
right now. Static sound blurted out of the speakers for a moment and 
much the same held true for the screen. Then the gray, white, and 
black cleared, giving way for the slightly distorted picture of a 
definitely attractive... kin.
	Light red hair, framed a gentle, yet battle-hardened face 
with deep black eyes of confidence and experience. Two streaks of 
metallic color gave the hair an exotic look - one silver, another 
gold -, despite the totally different meaning. Behind her, the 
experienced eye could see the buzzing of mint green/marine blue 
butterfly wings on the background of the black void of space.
	&quot;You won&#39;t believe what I stumbled upon, sis,&quot; the Efadio 
began without waiting for any indication that the transmission was 
stable. &quot;What is it, Pria?&quot; I urged, knowing that in the face of 
seriousness Priapos was hardly that excited. My old, elven friend put 
something between a smile and frown on her face and said without 
bravado: &quot;I found Adonis lair... or better what used to be his.&quot; This 
alone wasn&#39;t THAT much of a surprise - though it was one, since we 
had more or less given up hope already. However, what my kin sister, 
as well as combat mentor, added was enough to cause a variety of 
reactions within the three of us. &quot;On the Moon. In the middle of the 
ruins...&quot;
	&quot;BLASPHEMY!&quot; erupted Luna and I could definitely agree with 
her. Artemis gave a deep snarl and then turned back to Priapos&#39; 
image. &quot;Any sign of activity?&quot; The elf nodded. &quot;To be honest, a lot 
over the last hours. I couldn&#39;t get really near without being 
detected. But from what I see, preparations are made for something 
major.&quot;
	I nodded at that. &quot;We thought as much. Tomorrow will be The 
Day, and it just bears general principal that a reawakening won&#39;t go 
without a generous trigger event. Can you make it back in time?&quot; The 
elf looked thoughtful for a moment before answering. &quot;Most likely. I 
cannot guarantee anything though.&quot;
	&quot;Better than nothing. Be fast, I have the feeling we might 
need you. Venus, out.&quot; With that the screen went black and I turned 
around to face the pair of cats, a few more worries just added to the 
already existing ones. &quot;So it begins anew, huh?&quot; Neither Luna nor 
Artemis needed to answer the question.

(First gong)
Scenes fades up on the surface of a hilly land, covered with vivid 
green grass and a field of flowers. We see Usagi standing in the 
center in her princess gown but without the Crescent Moon sigil, 
Mamoru is standing off to the side in a black suit, watching her with 
a quiet smile.

(Second gong)
The camera swings around, capturing Minako and Hotaru sitting and 
leaning against each other in the flower field. Minako has an arm 
around Hotaru&#39;s shoulders and Hotaru&#39;s head is on her right shoulder, 
their fingers interlocked and eyes half-closed.

(Third gong)
The camera swings yet again towards Ami, Rei and Makoto a short 
distance away from the couples, enjoying the weather. Ami against a 
tree, reading, Rei dozing off in the sun and Makoto, chasing Artemis 
for some reason, while Luna sits nearby shaking her head.
(First notes up to lyrics)
The scene fades black shortly and then shows Usagi/Serenity rising 
into the sky, transforming into Sailormoon in the process, Tuxedo 
Kamen right beside her. The familiar shape of the Moon comes into 
view and the surface draws closer as the pair descend, showing the 
ruins of the fallen Moon Kingdom. Mercury, Mars and Jupiter join them 
shortly, as does Venus without Hotaru, Luna and Artemis to their 
respective partner&#39;s feet. The season logo is slowly drawn over the 
assembled senshi.

(Gomen ne sunao janakute)
(Yume no naka nara ieru)
(Shikou kairo wa shooto sunzen)
(Ima sugu aitai yo)
                       
We see Ami with a book in her hand walking down a street, before she 
looks and turns around to face the screen. The sign of Mercury 
flashes on her forehead and her form is momentarily overlaid by a 
translucent image of Sailormercury.
Rei can be seen with her back to the screen, working on something at 
the Jinja. Phobos and Deimos fly into the scene and perch upon Rei&#39;s 
shoulders. The miko turns around and the sign of Mars flashes on her 
forehead and her form is momentarily overlaid by a translucent image 
of Sailormars.
Makoto can be seen working out, her motions flowing flawlessly into 
each other. She suddenly halts in mid-motion and turns her head to 
face the camera. The sign of Jupiter flashes on her forehead and her 
form is momentarily overlaid by a translucent image of Sailorjupiter.

(Nakitaku naru you na moonlight)
Denwa mo dekinai midnight)
(Datte junjou doushiyou)
(Haato wa mangekyou)

Minako can be seen with jogging clothes, running down a street, sweat 
pouring from her forehead. She comes closer and the scene is suddenly 
frozen with a close-up on Minako, the sign of Venus on her forehead 
and the translucent layer of her senshi identity. The screen splits, 
leaving Minako frozen in place and showing now Hotaru in her room, 
lit by various candles and lamps, kneeling in a circle of the former. 
Her hair is hanging down and half-covers the concentration on her 
face. Suddenly darkness engulfs the room as well as Minako in the 
other scene. Hotaru desperately reaches out towards the other. For a 
moment her eyes turn blank and emotionless, the sign of Saturn 
flashes briefly on her forehead and her form is overlaid by the 
translucent image of Sailorsaturn, before everything turns black.

(Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare)
(Nando mo meguriau)

A group of four shadows becomes more detailed on the background of 
darkness. A brown-blond haired man, a redheaded pig-tailed one, a 
dark haired, very tall and heavy man and a light blue-haired one that 
looked remarkably female. A &quot;shadow&quot; can be seen looming over the 
four like a cloak covering a head.
Two points of light suddenly disrupt the darkness. On the left (,) 
the Silver Crystal can be seen and on the right, another teardrop-
shaped crystal. A thin line of violet slashes through the middle of 
the screen and shows Serenity and Endymion on the left side, Saturn 
and Venus on the right. Serenity holds the Silver Crystal high into 
the air, while Endymion supports her with one arm, the other on the 
sword hilt. Venus has the tear-shaped crystal in both hands and 
Saturn swings the Silence Glaive a few times for emphasis.

A brief flash shows Sailorpluto at the Time Gate looking worriedly 
upon the scene.
                       
(Seiza no matataki kazoe uranau koi no yukue)
(Onaji kuni ni umareta no)
(Mirakuru romansu)

Scene shifts to the Moon once again. Among the ruins, a large, black 
structure can be seen, vaguely resembling a military base. The scene 
shows the Senshi again, running side by side on the surface of the 
Moon, being assaulted by various Youma and other things... The 
Princess&#39;s guard jumps into the air, Mercury sending a stream of 
water and Jupiter a barrage of lightning combined into the enemy 
rows, Mars ignites a few more and Venus slashes through several 
opponents with a four-bladed, cross-like weapon out of pure 
crystalline light.
The scene shifts to an image of the Moon again, hanging loosely in 
black space. A blue, red and green star appears to the left, an 
orange and violet one to the right. In the middle, a bright silver 
and golden star joins the others. The stars are transformed into the 
Inner Senshi, Moon, Tuxedo Kamen and Hotaru, standing beside Venus on 
the right, a translucent image of Saturn hovering over her. The image 
of the intact Moon Palace is added to the background. Pluto appears 
above the group with the Time Staff raised; the Garnet Orb flashes a 
bright crimson and the scene freezes.

(Usagi)
Light pink blouse...? No, too childish. The blue shirt...? No, much 
too revealing. The sundress...? Not really appropriate for the event. 
Ok, that one might do. After all, I wanted to at least make some 
impression; otherwise, the whole thing would just really be wasted 
time. The house was rather silent. Otousan was already gone, snapping 
photos of the various events of Japan&#39;s famous Day of Sport for his 
work. And that was one thing I was really glad about. The teasing 
last evening over the implications of what I&#39;d do today was... 
embarrassing to say the least. At least Okaasan had sided with me and 
Shingo was not suicidal enough to object. Funny actually, we were 
getting along much better lately.
	I still couldn&#39;t believe Naru and Motoki had double-talked us 
into this, insisting that we would make such a &quot;cuuuute&quot; couple. Bah, 
as if this self-centered, egoistical, trash-talking, annoying, 
bashing me always, handsome, cool, intelligent, high classed... Ok, 
ok, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so bad after all. And I had to admit that I 
did feel somewhat drawn to the baka... sometimes. Only sometimes.
	Still, the thought of going out with Chiba Mamoru was a bit 
rivaling against my better judgment and made me feel a mixture of 
nervousness and... giddiness? Now, that was totally normal, I told 
myself. After all, it was a date! A real date! And Mamoru was far 
from every girl&#39;s nightmare of a boyfriend... quite the opposite 
actually.
	Again, I looked myself over in the mirror with the 
combination of the white tank-top and the dark blue shorts. Fine; it 
was simple, but suited the occasion somewhat and it still looked nice 
enough to impress a boy, leaving just enough to the imagination as 
necessary. Yes, I thought, that ought to do it.
	I twirled around, thereby noticing Luna on the windowsill. 
That got my attention, since the cat was usually out by now. More so 
in the last two months than usual. But today she seemed to be tailing 
me from the moment I woke up - at a rather early hour for me, 
considering it was a holiday. Could she be worried about the date and 
me? Of course, that was a silly thought. Yet, Luna seemed to be 
awfully smart for a feline and I often realized that I treated her 
more like a friend or a houseguest than an animal. I posed 
dramatically with one hand on my hip and the other brushing the loose 
hair back. &quot;So, what do you think?&quot; I did expect a lot of things 
actually, but the disapproving glance and the almost 
exasperated &quot;meow&quot; caught me completely off-guard. Before I could 
react though, Luna had crossed the distance between us in a flash and 
had hoped up to my level holding something in her mouth.
	I blinked rapidly at the object, then my eyes traveling to 
the mirror and back to Luna,  who was still holding the forgotten 
lipstick and now looking thoroughly annoyed. &quot;Oops...&quot; I really must 
have been nervous to forget AND overlook it. However, the next person 
I met that said cats were just mindless animals with not much more on 
their minds than eating and sleeping, I would surely give a piece of 
my mind.
	Taking the offered item from the cat, I patted her on the 
head. &quot;Arigato, Luna. What would I do without you?&quot; The cat gave me a 
look that could tell more than a thousand words and I found myself 
actually gulping. Luna was one hell of a weird cat. And the weirdest 
thing was that I still didn&#39;t remember how I got stuck with her. She 
was just... there.
	Finishing with dressing and finally getting an approved 
reaction out of the weirdo of a pet, I quickly rushed downstairs, got 
embarrassed by mom again over the whole thing, thankfully didn&#39;t run 
into Shingo and made it out of the door more or less still intact... 
Which was an accomplishment, really. Since I woke up this morning, I 
kept having the nagging feeling that something would go wrong on a 
major scale this day. That the date would turn into a natural 
disaster. I was nervous about the whole thing but it was slightly 
different. There was a dull sense of... anticipation that I couldn&#39;t 
make much sense of. Oh well, at least I didn&#39;t have strange dreams 
like that one two months ago. I had felt the after-effects days later.
Throwing thoughts of possible disaster out of the window, I smiled 
when I saw a red sport car pulling up in front of our house. Let&#39;s 
see of what material you are really made of, Chiba Mamoru.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----
 
(Ami)
&quot;205... 206... 207...&quot; (the dreaded word processor strikes again, 
huh?)
	It had to be on this floor, Makoto had said as much. That and 
I didn&#39;t think I could carry this bag any longer. Damn, I should have 
taken mother&#39;s offer to drive me here. Walking over was truly a bad 
idea. I had only packed a few things to get settled in, nothing 
major. But walking once directly through the whole district and then 
six floors up because the elevator was damaged... Ack! &quot;Maybe I 
should really have gotten myself a dorm room,&quot; I muttered.
	It was not that there wasn&#39;t enough money, but the idea 
simply didn&#39;t strike me as appealing. I wasn&#39;t exactly what could be 
called a wallflower but my social contacts were limited and apart 
from Makoto and the cheery but often annoying Usagi, nobody really 
bothered to talk with me. And taking my Sophomore Year in the new 
High School, sharing a room with somebody I didn&#39;t even know... No, 
not really appealing. And it was just too far from home to the 
school. So, Makoto&#39;s generous offer came just at just the right time.
	True, it was still a good seven months before the new school 
year started but that could give me time to get to know Makoto a bit 
more. And she had voiced that she wouldn&#39;t be complaining about some 
help for the entrance exams. School was something I was good at, and 
from the frequent sessions with Usagi, I considered my ability to 
teach quite good, even more so my patience...
	&quot;215... 216... 2... 217.&quot; With a relieved sigh I sat the bag 
down and opted to catch my breath for a moment. &quot;Hey, Ami-chan, the 
track races start in only a few hours, you know?&quot; I looked up to see 
the door open and a tall brunette with a ponytail leaning causally 
against the frame.
	She was wearing a red shirt and light yellow jeans. Still 
trying to get my breathing under control, I managed only a weary 
smile. &quot;The elevator didn&#39;t work, so I had to...&quot; I gestured in the 
direction of the staircase and Makoto just nodded, mildly 
annoyed. &quot;Yeah, they have the worst timing with repairs in this 
house. I warn you now, before you learn it the hard way.&quot; She looked 
down at my bag and frowned. &quot;What did you put in there to be so 
worked up, bricks?&quot;
	Not wanting to appear weak in front of the obviously stronger 
girl, I reached down to take the indicated object again. &quot;Not really, 
just a few... books...&quot; Apparently, I had overestimated my recovery 
ability - which wasn&#39;t good to begin with - because I almost doubled 
over. Two strong arms caught me before that could happen though, and 
I looked up thankful, even if a little embarrassed, at the other girl.
	&quot;Hey, you don&#39;t have to show false pride here. We all should 
know where our strengths lie.&quot; Bending down she took the bag easily 
in one hand, her face changing into a grimace though. &quot;Only a few 
books, huh?&quot; I smiled, blushing, and she grinned before waving me in.
	The room that greeted me was neither sparse nor overly 
decorated. There was a small couch, a few small seats, a board with a 
few books - from what I know I assumed cooking books -, most of the 
window-stills were covered with various flowers and plants which gave 
of a nice, comforting scent. Sunlight bathed the room in a warm and, 
just for a moment, illuminated it in an eerie, unearthly glow. One 
door led to the bedroom and another to a small bathroom.
&quot;To your liking?&quot; I snapped out of my reverie, hearing the door close 
behind me. Makoto strolled past me and placed the bag down. &quot;It&#39;s 
nice. Not as big as ours but that&#39;s okay.&quot; Makoto chuckled. &quot;I don&#39;t 
have a doctor as a mother and I&#39;m barely able to support myself. 
That&#39;s actually why I&#39;m letting you stay for rent.&quot; I didn&#39;t know the 
other girl quite so well, so that might excuse my next question, 
although it was incredibly stupid and tactless. &quot;What are your 
parents doing anyway, leaving you alone in...&quot; I trailed off seeing 
the hurt look and the flinch, as if physically slapped. Looking down 
at the ground, I felt ashamed at myself for being so rude to my host. 
Even if my social contact was limited, that was no way to  behave to 
the girl who offered to share her apartment with me for the upcoming 
time of High School.
	&quot;Gomen nasei, I shouldn&#39;t have...&quot; A hand touched my shoulder 
and I looked up again to see Makoto shaking her head. &quot;It&#39;s alright. 
I tell you something. Why don&#39;t you go take a shower, change into 
something more comfortable and then we go see some of the events.&quot; 
Contemplating this for a moment, my first impulse was to decline. 
That wasn&#39;t my thing normally, and sport events made me often a bit 
uncomfortable because of my own inability at physical exercise - 
except swimming. Still, we had started the day a bit on the wrong 
side and I felt inclined to make it up to my host. Also... It was a 
holiday after all and everyone was out, so...
	&quot;Okay.&quot; I smiled, grabbed some things out of my bag and 
headed to the shower.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Rei)
The morning was a beautiful one. There were no clouds and the weather 
seemed to be stable for the middle of October, a better thing at 
least than last year at the festivals. A lot of events had to be 
canceled at the jubilee, which was why this year was meant to make up 
for it. From above here, you could see a lot of people already moving 
through the streets and the latter quite full with preparations. The 
air was pleasant, neither hot nor cold. A nice, autumn morning that 
was simply perfect for some outdoor activity.
	I sighed, looking around the temple ground. No visitors until 
now. Sure, it was still early in the morning but I had the distinct 
idea that there wouldn&#39;t be much activity today. All the people were 
out, running the big marathon or participating in other events. 
Usually holidays were good for Hikawa Jinja, because of the land&#39;s 
strong bonds to culture, but the Taiiku no hi was always the 
exception.
	&quot;Rei!&quot; Surprised at being called, I turned around towards the 
stairs and saw a girl my age with short, light brown hair, clad in a 
track uniform, waving at me with me a smile. &quot;I&#39;m going over to the 
race now and wanted to ask, if you are coming.&quot; Once more, I looked 
around at the still vacant temple grounds and shook my head sadly. My 
earlier conclusion would hold true anyway, so there wasn&#39;t much to 
object against the offer. After all, I hadn&#39;t slept very well last 
night... I hadn&#39;t slept very well since that night two months ago, 
then the Sacred Fire had suddenly went out, just like that.
	Maybe I was really getting paranoid but I could not shake of 
the uneasy feeling I had about today. Something was up, something big.
	&quot;Actually, that&#39;s a good idea, Hitome. Just let me get 
something more comfortable. Be right back.&quot; With that, I went back 
into the shrine and to my room. If I was honest, I had planned to 
accompany Hitome to the marathon anyway. She had been such a great 
asset over the last half a year since she was here. Her spiritual 
abilities were nothing short of amazing. Especially her skill to find 
things or people, not to forget her almost always accurate tarot card 
readings... I had to admit, I was somewhat jealous at times, how she 
handled things without ever being trained as a miko. Nevertheless, 
Hitome was a great friend since coming to TA, one of the first real 
ones in years who weren&#39;t scared in the least about my abilities. A 
pleasant change.
	Emerging back from the house in a black combination of 
clothes, I headed over to Hitome and  just stood there for a moment 
looking out over the city from the top of the high stairs. &quot;Something 
is going to happen,&quot; the other girl murmured quietly. I nodded, not 
answering, there wasn&#39;t a reply expected anyway. &quot;My readings 
indicated a great change would come upon us today and... a rebirth.&quot;
	&quot;Rebirth?&quot; I arched an eyebrow at her but Hitome just shook 
her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know what that means, believe me.&quot; And Hitome not 
knowing what her readings meant was something that happened in five 
percent of all cases. &quot;I guess we just have to figure it out then. 
You ready to win?&quot; The other girl nodded, a look of concentration and 
determination briefly lightening her eyes. &quot;Definitely.&quot;
	Together we headed down the stairs, wondering what today 
would bring us.

The streets were full of people as we walked along the Minato 
district towards the start of the marathon. Left and right, you could 
see various events involving physical competition. Ball games, track 
races, even some dancing somewhere off to the side. Last year had 
really been a flop. Everything had been set on the thirty-year 
celebration, everything was ready and the weather had been good for 
weeks. Nobody suspected it could as much as trickle... Yet, right at 
the morning a rainstorm hit that held far into the late afternoon. By 
then the holiday was royally ruined. Funny actually. If I remembered 
correctly, it hadn&#39;t rained in the first loop... Minako had been a 
bit grumpy about her injury but, seeing that the events were falling 
through anyway, that did lighten her mood considerably. This year, 
she was all set and would probably get interrupted by coincidental 
events that seemed to haunt the life of a Senshi. &quot;And I&#39;m telling 
you: No Youma will stop me from running today. And winning of 
course.&quot; Of course, that didn&#39;t mean that my partner thought about it 
quite like that.
	&quot;Of course you will, Aino-chan,&quot; a soft voice replied. The 
soft, somewhat dark voice belonged to the younger girl; her head 
currently slightly leaned against Minako&#39;s shoulder. My partner had 
an arm around the girl&#39;s waist, pointedly ignoring any looks the 
couple might get from passer-byes. Minako quirked an eyebrow at the 
raven-haired girl, &quot;Do I detect a hint of sarcasm there, Raven?&quot; The 
girl shook her head. &quot;No, I&#39;m just admiring your determination.&quot; At 
this, I snorted. &quot;Hotaru... you sure, you didn&#39;t want to say thick-
headedness?&quot; As expected, I promptly got swatted for the comment and 
wisely shut up for the moment.
	We probably presented a very unique sight. With Minako 
walking in &quot;the middle&quot;, Hotaru on her right, drawn tightly against 
the blonde, and me riding on Minako&#39;s left shoulder. Under other 
circumstances, I would probably have opted to walk but with this many 
people out, I didn&#39;t feel quite safe on the ground. And unlike Luna, 
I had the benefit of talking to my partner again. Even in the 
presence of Tomoe Hotaru. Or should I say, because of Tomoe Hotaru? 
Probably.
	The white-skinned girl with the ebony black hair in contrast 
had been a part of everything that happened before, in and since 
England. Without her as an initiator, Venus would still be sleeping 
and the dumb idiot of a would-be suitor still running around. It had 
been quite a shock for me at first, but if you just watched those two 
for a while, you could see how happy they were. Especially in light 
of Venus&#39; near cursed status considering personal love. I was not 
happy at first but quickly realized that both were quite obviously 
happy; besides, what kind of guardian would I be to not allow my 
charge the happiness she deserved? Not that things hadn&#39;t gotten 
slightly out of control after the chancy meeting months ago and the 
somewhat fated one back in England.
	Minako leaned down to whisper something in Hotaru&#39;s ear and 
the younger girl giggled. I had the dark suspicion it was about me. I 
had to smile despite the possible nature of Hotaru&#39;s humor. I had to 
admit, the girl was growing on me. In the two months after the first 
change, after she revealed what I had expected nearly from the start, 
she had been more vivid as ever. As I had hoped, the physical and 
mental healing had a massive impact on her emotions. She was still 
withdrawn and shy at times - especially then someone brought the 
family issue up -, but Minako&#39;s company and the new chance at life 
she had gotten, left her in amazingly high spirits.
	We had reached the area where the participants of this year&#39;s 
marathon gathered, the amount of people ready to run their feet sore 
for fun was remarkable. It wasn&#39;t, as if I didn&#39;t enjoy a good hunt 
now and then and I was quite the athlete in the old Silver Millennium 
days but... I could not, for the life of me, really grasp how people 
could enjoy this. This, of course, was because Minako absolutely had 
to participate.
	Minako disengaged from her girlfriend a short distance away 
from the general crowd, which prompted Hotaru to pout and Minako to 
grin sweetly at her. She bent down and placed a quick kiss on the 
shorter girl&#39;s lips. &quot;Remember, I want that to be a surprise later. 
No touching beyond friendly.&quot; I wondered what they understood as 
friendly. Still, it was just like Minako to wait with the news until 
today&#39;s events, when they had regained total control of their 
memories, and then drop the bucket of cold water over their heads... 
Or something like that. I still remembered Luna&#39;s reaction very well, 
and it was simply due to the events in England I think that Minako&#39;s 
resolve didn&#39;t crumble under the black cat&#39;s rant - that went on near 
to an hour, I think.
	&quot;I&#39;ll make it up to you later,&quot; Minako promised Hotaru in a 
low, definitely husky voice, which made her companion blush and me 
cringe. These two sometimes really worried me. Especially since 
Hotaru was still that young and Minako just turning sixteen in two 
weeks. Someone that didn&#39;t know the circumstances involved with these 
two, would surely call my partner something short of abusive... Oh 
well, those didn&#39;t know and they shouldn&#39;t know either. If they just 
wouldn&#39;t give me the creeps every time...

(Luna)
Balancing on the fence was a task a cat could perform as good as 
walking. What martial artists might see as a balance training, was 
second nature for us... or probably first. So, since I didn&#39;t need to 
concentrate, it didn&#39;t help to ease my thoughts in the slightest. I 
had had much to think about in the last two months since Minako and 
Artemis came back from their trip in England with some very 
disturbing information - namely Hotaru - and even more unsettling 
secrets.
	While I was still pensive about the Hotaru-issue, there 
wasn&#39;t much I could do about that. I had been aware of the fact that 
Minako had apparently awakened before they returned. The material 
Artemis&#39; had sent back to me said as much. But until now, I still was 
unsuccessful at getting more than the most general information out of 
the two and Artemis. All I knew was probably leaving more holes in 
the overall picture than giving useful information.
	I knew Artemis quite well. We had practically been together 
since our childhood. A good hunter he had once been and probably 
still was. Very reliable to gather information or scout enemy terrain 
and a very loyal companion to the Moon Family and even more so to 
Hebe, Venus&#39; Alter Ego. Usually it only took a little persistence 
from my side until he spilled all his secrets to me but then he was 
like that... It simply was best to lay the matter to rest until the 
three of them opened up from their own. Artemis could be really 
stubborn and if it involved his Venus... well, let&#39;s just say it 
would take a nova to penetrate his defenses. No point getting my 
claws broken there.
	Still. I swear to you, Tomoe Hotaru was creepy. Really 
creepy. And I don&#39;t mean about her latent gift of powerful healing as 
much as her and Minako&#39;s strange reactions to affection. Merely 
kissing still sent a shiver down my spine. I had some distant ideas 
about what Senshi mating was expected to be like. However, Hotaru was 
a normal, if even extraordinary, human being. There was no hidden 
personality in her, nothing that indicated another Sailor... Somehow, 
I had a hard time believing myself though.
	Focusing my attention back at the couple I was following, I 
caught Usagi and Mamoru trading conversational jabs... again. Naru, 
who had joined the couple, shook her head with a faint smile, 
probably wondering, if her idea was so good after all. In any case, 
it insured that everyone would be together in the same place today. 
Rei, Ami and Makoto would surely be drawn too. If not, I would 
promptly bite my tail off. That was the other thing that made me 
nervous though. Today would be The Day. The day we had expected, yet 
dreaded.
	I respected Usagi&#39;s wish highly and even if the Silver 
Millennium would never rise again in the future, for all their sakes, 
I would let their Senshi lives sleep. Forever if that was necessary. 
But Venus&#39; reawakening and the arrival of an unknown force, obviously 
linked with the Dark Kingdom we had thought was completely 
annihilated, was enough of a sign that the brief period of peace was 
over. I would go chasing a bull terrier before I deliberately 
reactivated their memories, yet it seemed the chances for that became 
more and more fact.
	&quot;Mako-chan, Ami-chan, over here!&quot; I looked up to see Mercury 
and Jupiter approaching. I was glad that despite the memory reversal 
my prediction had been at least partially true. Usagi, Ami and Makoto 
at least had formed a loose companionship that, while it was not 
quite the friendship it used to be, but definitely was going there. 
Rei had been somewhat more reclusive and Minako had opted to stay 
away because she was afraid she might trigger something unexpectedly.
	&quot;Now, you got yourself quite a catch there, Usagi,&quot; Makoto 
commented teasingly. My  charge had the grace to blush before 
protesting. However, even to her, I think, it sounded lame. &quot;You know 
that wasn&#39;t my idea. I&#39;ll just...&quot; Ami simply smiled inwardly as Naru 
elbowed her oldest friend. &quot;Exactly, that is why you have actually 
put an effort in looking good, right?&quot; Usagi huffed adequately and 
turned away with a cross expression. &quot;Sure. Gang up on me, will you?&quot; 
Turning to Mamoru she added: &quot;So? What do you wait for? Don&#39;t you 
have anything to say?&quot; The older boy in question flashed a smile at 
his official date. &quot;So far, I have enjoyed myself.&quot;
	That effectively silenced the small group since it was 
absolutely impossible to say, if he was teasing like Makoto and Naru, 
or being genuine. 

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Makoto)
A pair of martial artists showed a few complex katas for the crowd to 
the right. I snorted at the display. That would be sooooo helpful in 
a real fight... I was training constantly now with my new sensei and 
felt that I really was improving. That display though... Pure show, 
nothing else. They would probably not last in a real fight for five 
seconds, at least if that wasn&#39;t a simple, public demonstration. Not 
that I cared for it.
	The general volume of our conversation had turned down 
considerably. Usagi was stealing almost shy glances at Chiba-san ever 
since his ominous comment, which I personally think the blonde 
interpreted too much. Naru was hanging back a bit, giving the couple 
some space. And Ami was walking quietly, showing some mild interest 
in the side attractions. At first, I thought my offer to be a bad 
idea, but now I thought that we both might profit from the 
arrangement. The girl definitely needed some more social contact and 
as average as I was, my grades were surely not stellar. Although, I 
did consider it a good sign that Ami had voiced practically no 
protest when I invited her to tag along. The Ami I met about a year 
back would have never even considered the thought. I swear, I 
wouldn&#39;t be Kino Makoto, if I didn&#39;t get her to open up some more 
soon.
	Ami had stopped in front of a booth, the type you could find 
on every fair. There was a collection of prizes on one wall and one 
had to throw little darts at the targets. I had to suppress a smile; 
Ami had apparently fallen in love with a small stuffed animal, a blue 
and white dolphin to be exact. If it wasn&#39;t so extraordinary to see 
Ami&#39;s eyes lingering longingly on the object, I would not have given 
it any further thought. But... that was Ami we were talking about.
	With a gesture, I told the others that they should go on 
ahead and we would catch up later. I stepped beside Ami at the booth 
and waved a hand in front of her face. The smaller girl blinked and 
then blushed, embarrassed. How cute. I regarded the owner of the 
booth with a confident look. &quot;One shot, please.&quot; Taking a coin, I 
handed it to him and received five darts. Oh well. Leaves something 
for me, right? The man pressed a hidden button and the targets began 
moving rapidly. The smaller, lesser ones covering the more valuable 
items. &quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Ami whispered, finally catching up on what I was 
doing, &quot;you don&#39;t have to...&quot; I waved, dismissing the objection. 
Sparing Ami a smile, I briefly concentrated and without even looking, 
threw all five darts at once, hitting all the high prices dead on, 
including the dolphin. My smile turned into a smug grin as the man 
grimaced and Ami stared with wide eyes. I guess, you were right about 
the concentration thing, Sensei.
	Accepting my prizes from the grumbling booth owner, I handed 
the dolphin to a still stunned Ami. &quot;Here you go.&quot; With trembling 
hands, the shorthaired girl took the offered item and managed a weak 
smile. &quot;A-Arigato...&quot; Leaving an unhappy man behind, we began to 
catch up with the others.
	That proved to be a little hard since they had already 
mingled with the crowd gathering around the start of the marathon. 
Briefly, I wondered, if I shouldn&#39;t have taken my sensei&#39;s advice 
that this would have been a good opportunity to see how well my speed 
and endurance training was coming along. However, I never was one for 
miles-long races. A good fight in close quarters didn&#39;t really need 
someone to run THAT much. It was not that I didn&#39;t see the 
possibilities here; a marathon just wasn&#39;t my thing.
	We found the others finally after searching around for five 
minutes. Ami was still babbling about how I didn&#39;t have to do what I 
had done - damn, she really needed to go out some more - and how what 
I have done, was actually impossible. I was just about to point for 
the nth-time that I just did what she thought impossible, then I 
spotted the others as well as another familiar face. The local miko 
Hino Rei and her assistant... What was her name? Hitome, I think. 
Apparently, the latter was participating.
	&quot;Hey, minna!&quot; I called, gaining everyone&#39;s attention and then 
waving in Rei&#39;s direction. I wasn&#39;t really into religion and stuff 
but the girl seemed nice from the one time we were up there. Not 
really much of a socialist either, yet that probably was true for 
almost everyone of us. Usagi&#39;s eyes lit up and I recognized the look 
immediately. If it was one thing that was unique about Usagi, then it 
was her ability to make friends easily. A rare innocence that might 
be a bit na&iuml;ve but was certainly refreshing. I had the feeling we 
would not leave today without Rei becoming a part of our little, 
merry group. Oh well...

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Mamoru)
As expected by probably everyone, we made our way over to the miko 
and her friend. I had briefly met Rei before but didn&#39;t know that 
much about the raven-haired girl as I should have... Should have? 
What the heck? That sounded almost, as if I knew her from somewhere. 
I had to admit she was definitely good-looking and surely acceptable 
as a girlfriend, if one would go for the younger types but... Oh, 
whom was I kidding? After all, I was on a date with someone nearly 
four years four years my junior - even if that circumstance was 
against my better judgment. My only hope was that Motoki wouldn&#39;t 
exaggerate and let something slip, or I would probably be topic 
number one tomorrow. My university might be a high quality one, but 
one thing that would always be the same with all schools was that 
rumors tended to spread very, very fast. And with the mass of people 
on the streets and all around us, there was no telling who knew 
already. Oh well, I would deal with my own stupidity later. I really 
should make the best of the day.
	&quot;Ah, if it isn&#39;t Miss Clumsy!&quot; Rei greeted Usagi directly, 
ignoring the rest of us. She smirked at my blonde date. &quot;I must say, 
I haven&#39;t laughed so much in ages since the last time you were at the 
shrine...&quot; I know she was teasing, badly, but Usagi didn&#39;t seem to 
take it like that, since I saw her practically fuming. But before she 
could return the favor, Rei let her gaze wander over the rest of us, 
lingering for a moment on me. The intense gaze made me a little 
uncomfortable. &quot;Oh, lovely company. Are you here with one of them?&quot; 
With a hand motion, she included everyone but Usagi. I could see the 
counter attack from my mutual date coming from miles away, really.
	Hands on her hips and a triumphant smirk on her face, Usagi 
thumped one hand proudly over her chest. &quot;Hah! For your information. 
He is with me and not interested in anyone else!&quot; I groaned and 
muttered: &quot;And who is asking me?&quot; Naru shot me a sympathetic look, 
obviously familiar with the blonde&#39;s antics. As if on cue, Rei and 
Usagi were literally at each others throats, each of them proclaiming 
that they were much better looking than the other...
	&quot;I thought they just met once,&quot; stated Makoto, shaking her 
head in disbelief. If that was the reaction at the second meeting, 
then Usagi should better reconsider at making friends with her. The 
basis was a little... shaky. &quot;I think they like each other.&quot; I 
averted my gaze from the fighting girls and noticed that the other 
girl who had been with Rei was mildly smiling. &quot;How did you figure 
that?&quot; The girl shrugged. &quot;Rei has a good heart, really. She just has 
this temper problem and isn&#39;t that used to having many friends. 
Usagi... Well, let&#39;s say her friendliness irritated her the first 
time.&quot;
	I saw Ami and Makoto exchanging a look that wasn&#39;t of 
the &quot;don&#39;t we know it&quot; category. There was a deep sympathy that 
apparently came from own experiences on this field. &quot;I think, I can 
understand that,&quot; Ami finally said. &quot;Usagi does have a unique gift to 
make others trust her. Those sorts of people aren&#39;t actually 
conventional. I was a little spooked at first too. Usagi was the 
first one, trying hard to be my friend not just for the purpose of 
getting better grades.&quot; Makoto quietly nodded.
	Apparently, the little Odango Atama did earn her loyalty 
well. I felt a little stupid, standing there and saying nothing after 
I had so heavily protested to this date at first. It really wasn&#39;t 
like I couldn&#39;t see what they saw but... Oh really, kami help me, 
there wasn&#39;t a &quot;but&quot;. Usagi was a unique creature, and if our 
fighting stood in any competition to that of Usagi and Rei&#39;s, and the 
girl was right that they liked each other... Damn, as it seemed, 
there was no way around it. I would soon have a girlfriend quite some 
years younger.
	Before I could further brood over the subject any longer 
though, I felt a strange tugging on my mind and on impulse turned 
around. There was a blonde girl with a striking resemblance to Usagi 
making her way through the crowd, with a white cat riding on her 
shoulders. A moment later, she spotted us, smiled in a mixture of joy 
and sadness and started to head forward. She hadn&#39;t made two steps 
before all hell broke loose...

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Hotaru)
The world just wasn&#39;t fair. I wanted to be as close as possible when 
Minako started and not somewhere in the far back. Okay, the distant 
possibility that the start wouldn&#39;t be as soon as expected was there 
but still... Alright, maybe not so distant. I didn&#39;t mean that I did 
not trust her, because I definitely did, so when she said it would be 
safer for me to stay away, I would do so. Even if I think that, half 
the reason was to hold me out of sight for now. I didn&#39;t think she 
was afraid of her friend&#39;s reactions afterwards or something like 
that. No, Minako, the Minako that I had slowly brought out of her 
shell of loneliness was rather playful and mischievous. She did that 
solely for the purpose of getting the best reaction out of her 
friends as possible. Still... I thought that to be a bit of bad 
timing in this situation.
	Kami, what if something did happen and she got hurt, needed 
me... What if she needed her powers refreshed or maybe some of the 
others needed healing... Sure, I knew better than to run into the 
middle of a battle and distract Minako with my presence and I really 
didn&#39;t want to end as a Youma snack but... My rambling thoughts were 
rudely interrupted when the screaming around me started. &quot;Huh?&quot; 
Frantically I looked around for the source of it. I didn&#39;t need to 
look long since there wasn&#39;t anywhere to direct your eyes to where 
you wouldn&#39;t see a creature the majority of the human race deemed 
myth right out of a horror story. &quot;Kami-sama!&quot; I breathed.
	There were at least a dozen Youma and all of them radiated a 
high level of power. I had learned to trust my high-tuned spiritual 
senses on that and I did know that I was right in the middle of what 
could easily turn out as the biggest massacre in history. I wanted to 
back away but registered that the Youma had formed a wide circle 
around the people at the starting point for the marathon. There was 
no way to back out. Nowhere to run. Damn... I hated it when Minako 
was right about this. But surely, she didn&#39;t expect something THAT 
big, right?
	People were running around in a blind panic, some of them 
headfirst into Youma, who immediately pummeled them senseless. I 
wondered what the purpose of this assault was besides the gathering 
of mass energy. Normally I wouldn&#39;t care but the Youma didn&#39;t seem to 
make any attempts of collecting ki. They were just wracking havoc.
	&quot;Hotaru! Watch out!&quot; At the sound of a familiar voice, I 
whirled around, just in time to see an energy blast heading my way. I 
closed my eyes, bracing for the worst but the next thing I knew was 
being held in gentle yet strong arms and flying through the air. I 
shook my head trying to clear the dizziness. I didn&#39;t have any 
blackouts since... well, since the day of my rescue from Adonis in 
England. I hadn&#39;t been close to a fight since then too, so that might 
have to do something with it. I think all those involved knew what it 
meant but wouldn&#39;t tell me. Since the demon was gone it couldn&#39;t 
really been a bad thing and I wasn&#39;t sure if I really wanted to know. 
Also, every time I tried to analyze it further, my mind would refuse 
to obey and simply forget about... Like right now. I looked up and 
smiled at the redheaded elf carrying me out of the circle of 
Youma. &quot;Good to see you.&quot; Priapos grinned. &quot;No problem. Minako would 
kill me, if I&#39;d let anything happen to you.&quot; And she did have a 
testament to this statement already. Something I would rather not 
like to think about since it was the beginning of one of my worst 
times. My girlfriend&#39;s kin sister flew some distance away from the 
battle, to a space already cleared of hectically fleeing people. As 
soon as we touched ground, Priapos sat me down but I think my knees 
almost gave way under me. That had been a close call, too close.
	&quot;Hey, you alright?&quot; The elf had gently touched my arm, 
looking at me concerned. I shook my head to clear the numb feeling 
and nodded. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. Go help Minako.&quot; For a moment, I thought 
she would protest but in the end, simply decided to give me a stern 
look. &quot;You stay here.&quot; Snorting, I brushed some strands of hair 
back. &quot;Sure. One close encounter with death was enough for today.&quot; I 
couldn&#39;t identify what exactly it was that my friend muttered but she 
turned around, spread her wings again and headed back to the 
battlefield. I watched her leave in silence, worry clearly marking my 
features. Be okay, Minako. Please.

(Mamoru/Endymion)
When I woke up this morning my only worries had been going out on a 
date with a girl four years younger and totally contradicting to my 
own personality. These were great worries, mind you, since I had not 
at all been comfortable with being pushed into this. But I was not 
the type of guy to chicken out and simply stand her up. And it had 
turned out as a rather pleasant day until now. The company of the 
younger girls had been refreshing and Usagi didn&#39;t seem that much in 
the mood to ruin her date either. So, actually everything was fine. 
Of course, it would be too much to ask, that everything stayed that 
way.
	Looking out from the high balcony of the magnificent white 
palace in the middle of a wide ocean - both in a place there they 
shouldn&#39;t be by normal human belief -, I gazed at the clear 
crystalline pearl of Earth hanging in the sky or better the area in 
space that could be identified as a sky. Everything was peaceful, 
beautiful, much like I remembered. However, everything was also a 
simple illusion. A dream world only for us, those who remembered the 
old times.
	&quot;Your Highness,&quot; I regarded the form of the woman resembling 
my beloved so much with a nod. Queen Serenity, late ruler of the 
fallen Moon Kingdom, stepped next to me and looked silently out at 
the beautiful landscape that was once the miracle of the 
Ginsiushou. &quot;It truly is beautiful, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked with a soft, 
wistful voice after some time. Oh yes, it was beautiful. Everything 
here had been more or less magical - as was probably everything else 
in the solar system except Earth - but still radiated such a natural 
beauty that you wouldn&#39;t believe all this was created, even in this 
dreamscape. It was a shame that nobody would ever know about such a 
beauty again.
	&quot;Oh, they will. Sooner or later they will. And it will be 
yours and Serenity&#39;s to create.&quot; The directness caught me off guard 
and I turned a questioning look at the queen. Serenity merely 
smiled. &quot;She is the heir, the line must survive. And you, Prince, I 
expect to take up my daughter as she surely wishes you to.&quot; The 
intense stare Serenity sent my way made me squirm but I managed to 
hold the challenging eye-contact until Serenity nodded satisfied.
	She turned around and gestured for me to follow her. &quot;Don&#39;t 
get me wrong, Endymion. It is not my place to make the decisions in 
your life for you. But as a mother, I must ensure my daughter&#39;s 
happiness. Do you love my daughter, Prince of Earth?&quot; I didn&#39;t need 
to think. As freaked as I was this morning about a simple date, it 
was all so clear now. I had put Serenity as well as Usagi through a 
lot the last time and I would make sure that this time there would be 
a happy end. How could someone not love her? Even without our 
memories we had been drawn together again. No, the question didn&#39;t 
really need an answer.
	Serenity nodded in confirmation to my thoughts, obviously 
guessing what went through my mind. &quot;Where are the others anyway?&quot; I 
asked in return, admiring the inside of the Moon Palace. The long, 
wide hallways, the crystalline decorations, not too fancy but still 
clearly showing wealth and status. &quot;We are on our way to join them. I 
suppose they will be a bit disorientated.&quot; I raised an eyebrow 
confused. Serenity chuckled lightly. &quot;Oh, the memory block my 
daughter placed upon them can only be removed directly. The palace 
will seem familiar to them but... They won&#39;t remember anything and I 
somehow doubt Luna or Artemis would have done anything so soon. You, 
Endymion, do have the benefits of your own power equally as strong as 
my daughters. That is why you remember.&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re wrong, I don&#39;t have such powers...&quot; Serenity chided 
me with a look. &quot;Do you question my wisdom?&quot; I shook my head 
lamely. &quot;Good.&quot; Stopping in front of the doors to a smaller chamber, 
she turned around to face me. &quot;We are here. I would ask you to wait 
here until I remove the block. I think it would only further confuse 
them, if they saw you like... this.&quot; She pointed at my uniform and I 
nodded in understanding.
	With that she entered the chamber and left me to my own 
jumbled thoughts. My mind was mainly trying to wrap around one 
concept. I was supposed to have powers like Usagi? That was 
ridiculous. After all Usagi was the Moon Princess, the heroine 
Sailormoon, the wielder of the Silver Crystal. I didn&#39;t have anything 
except some fancy speeches, an endless supply of roses and a cane... 
Not really any competition to any of the Senshi actually. But... Why 
should the Queen lie about this? Was there really something inside of 
me that rivaled the Ginsuishou&#39;s power? I didn&#39;t have any time to 
further dwell on the disturbing subject before Serenity called me in.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Usagi)
The feeling of knowing a place that you beyond doubt haven&#39;t set foot 
into was one of the undiscovered mysteries of human nature. There was 
this striking that you belonged at the specific place, if as someone 
had called you to come... no, return here. A familiarity that had 
nothing to do with the actual term. However, all this stood in 
absolutely NO comparison to the feeling I experienced now. The room 
was small, it bore the looks of a small foyer-like chamber. Small 
that is, compared to the size of the palace we were currently in. 
When looking out of the window you could not really estimate the size 
of the structure but from what the natural beauty of the chamber and 
the richness of decoration spoke of, left no doubt about surely grand 
dimensions.
	&quot;Okay, I say, we waited long enough. Let&#39;s go out and find 
someone... or something,&quot; Makoto said annoyed at being stuck here in 
the strange surroundings. Apparently we weren&#39;t on Earth anymore, the 
fact that said planet hung high in the &quot;sky&quot; did help to clarify 
that, and so far we had yet to encounter who or whatever force had 
brought us here, mere moments after a huge assembly of horror movie 
monsters had invaded the event grounds. I was still trying to 
convince myself that this had been some sort of comedy play to 
entertain the masses, yet somehow I really, REALLY doubted that.
	I looked over the group consisting of Ami, Makoto, Rei and 
the blonde girl as well as - and that really spooked me - the white 
cat that was with Minako and Luna. No one else. Neither Naru nor 
Hitome and certainly no Mamoru. It had all happened so fast and 
before we know it a strange light had engulfed us and we found 
ourselves here. Unharmed but very much freaked... Except Minako that 
is who simply seemed to anxiously await something.
	Rei looked up suddenly which alerted the rest of our merry, 
little group. Nobody was able to say anything before the door opened 
and the vision of an angel appeared in its frame. Really, there was 
no better way to describe the woman. Her face seemed old... No, wise, 
I corrected myself. Yet her body was as healthy as someone who had 
just grown out of her teens. A full-blown adult body no doubt but 
young at the same time. An eternal beauty that time couldn&#39;t touch.
	&quot;I am truly sorry to have you waiting. I had another guest to 
welcome first.&quot; The sound of her voice was gentle and soothing... 
Familiar? Why did I feel so... happy when I looked at this woman? 
Like a baby who had seen his mother for the first time and still 
knew, somehow, that this unfamiliar creature was indeed its 
mother. &quot;Who are you?&quot; Makoto asked a little defensive, eyeing the 
woman carefully. Ami stood unsure what to do, while Rei seemed almost 
awed and the other girl, Minako... was kneeling?
	I blinked in confusion at her. &quot;My Queen.&quot; The woman smiled 
and walked forward to place a hand on Minako&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You have 
done well so far, Venus, but now it is time for the guard to be 
completed again. It is...&quot; She paused for a moment, looking at me... 
apologetic? &quot;... necessary.&quot; Minako nodded and rose. &quot;Arigato, 
Serenity-sama.&quot; The name triggered something in my subconscious that 
made my ears perk up and my eyes even more fixed on the strange 
woman... Serenity.
	Rei cleared her throat, obviously having to force her ability 
to speak up. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be rude, Your Majesty. But why are we 
here and where exactly is... here?&quot; Serenity smiled... well, serene 
at the miko. Her gaze wandered slowly over everyone for a long period 
of time. She looked almost sad now. &quot;I must apologize again that I 
have to do this but the world needs you.&quot;
	Raising a hand I noticed the golden crescent moon sigil on 
her forehead glowing and without the warning the memories began to 
flow. Memories from a time long forgotten, from a year that was and 
at the same time was not. Memories of a battle that was antagonizing 
and unbelievable painful to the heart. Memories of friends found and 
lost, of companions that always came through with you and yet at the 
end had to die albeit all the effort. I closed my eyes tightly shut, 
trying to cut the flow of pictures but I couldn&#39;t. Unyielding the 
revelation of what had once been came back and forced me to remember 
what I had been, what I still am and that I could not escape my fate 
as I hoped too.
	My eyes snapped open as the blinding light created by our 
joined powers hid Beryl/Metallia and I saw out at the world again. 
However, the eyes that were seeing now were different. Wiser, 
older... sadder. Tears, they were there too, and without hesitating I 
rushed forward to embrace the astral form of my mother. Queen 
Serenity of the Moon Kingdom, the previous ruler of the greatest, 
peaceful empire the galaxy had ever known.
	&quot;Serenity,&quot; mother murmured and pushed me back slightly to 
brush a few tears from my eyes. I understood now how much it pained 
her to do this to us. After all the efforts. However, thinking back 
at the army of Youma waiting back in our world I could understand. We 
were the only ones capable of facing the threat. It was our fate, our 
destiny. As sad as it was. I stepped back and turned my head to look 
at my friends... comrades, teammates... in a way my sisters. They had 
watched on in silence but the look on her face was one of 
understanding. They remembered and now were together again. Just 
where we ended... Just where we started.
	Minako, Venus, seemed to be unfazed by all this though as if 
expecting... She knew! And she must have been awake for quite some 
time now. Why I could not really understand but a lot of things began 
to make more sense now. My friend caught my look and smiled softly, 
it was a little strained but she appeared to be... happy? Strange.
	I turned back to mother expectantly. &quot;Mother, why are we here 
and what do those Youma at the track course mean?&quot; Queen Serenity 
smile fell and was replaced by a serious mask. Somehow I didn&#39;t like 
that. That wasn&#39;t the look of someone to bear bad news... that was 
more the look of someone to bring worse news. &quot;Before we get to 
that...&quot; Mother stopped and turned her head slightly towards the 
door. &quot;Will you come in please.&quot;
	She moved aside as another figure came into the room. There 
was this slight pull and without even looking I would have known 
instinctively that it was Mamoru/Endymion. He was wearing the same 
uniform that he always did. Briefly the sight called up a well of 
terrific memories but I quickly replaced them with those Serenity had 
of Endymion that I still remembered. Seeing him there, made me 
unimaginably happy. I had feared that only we would get our memories 
back and quite frankly I didn&#39;t know, if I could have stood for it. 
The date so far had gone well but I didn&#39;t know, if I had the 
patience with the memories of all the time that had been lost over 
the course of our previous encounters. I would have mixed things up 
and maybe scared him away. But this fear evaporated instantly when I 
saw him smile at me fondly.
	Hesitantly moving forward, I suppressed the urge to just rush 
forward and jump into his arms. I really wanted to but that wouldn&#39;t 
be really proper. Proper? Geez, it must have been the palace and the 
princess gown, I even felt more like Serenity here. No, there was 
something else too. I didn&#39;t want to ruin the mood with my usual 
childish behavior. I was fifteen by now after all, maybe it was time 
to grow up a little. (A/N: Don&#39;t stare at me! I mean it!)
	Mamoru slowly walked towards me and I met him halfway. Before 
he knew what hit him though, I reached up to pull his head down and 
give him a rather stunning kiss, relishing in the feeling of love and 
the security of his strong arms that had went instantly around me. &quot;I 
wanted to do this for a long time. There will never be a nicer guy 
than you. Aishiteru.&quot; His simple smile, I decided, melted my heart 
right there. &quot;I do love you too.&quot; For that brief moment everything 
around me was forgotten and for this one moment I was truly happy. I 
knew a long road lay ahead of us, a long and stony road. Yet, I was 
content that we would get through, together.
	Sadly the moment was soon interrupted, when Luna cleared her 
throat. I blushed slightly, noticing that I must have totally zoomed 
out there for some time but looking at Mamoru I guess I wasn&#39;t the 
only one. Luna hid a smile and I held out my arms for her when Mamoru 
and I walked over to join the other girl&#39;s in facing the Moon Queen. 
My guardian gave a soft purr as she jumped up and soon took her 
familiar place on my shoulder. I reached up to stroke her gently and 
we simply smiled at each other. It was good to be able to talk with 
Luna again.
	&quot;Alright, mother,&quot; I said, addressing more serious matters 
again. &quot;Why are we here?&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Ami)
All my life I had been a person living clear to the principle. First 
think then act. My mind was sharp and my intelligence high quality, 
trained to handle any possible situation within the parameters of 
logical analysis. It was rare that I didn&#39;t catch up to a concept 
quickly and it was even rarer that I lost my grip on reality. 
However, could you blame someone who just experienced a rush of 
memories that the person wasn&#39;t aware to posses? I wished that we 
would have gotten those memories back in the middle of a fight, that 
would have given me time to ignore them for more direct needs. But we 
weren&#39;t at the track course anymore and there weren&#39;t any Youma here 
to concentrate on. So I had only the option to silently proceed the 
emotions and pictures that came with the memories while watching our 
Princess rejoice with her prince.
	The experience was unlike anything else. Memories of the 
repeated years were misty, blurred together and hard to identify as 
belonging in the one timeframe or another. There was good and bad in 
both. On the one side the lost ones held memories of a smiling ever-
present Usagi slowly bringing me in a social circle of friends that 
were her teammates. There was trust and companionship, a close 
friendship formed and steadied through many hardships. Hardships that 
were heavily weighing down on everyone, especially Usagi when she 
lost Mamoru to the Dark Kingdom. Then, there was the rescue attempt 
and the horribly outcome. My own death... I shuddered a little at the 
thought.
	On the other hand, I had memories of about two years of a 
slow repeat of the former without the added weight of being a Senshi. 
I never felt that content around Usagi or Makoto than I had been the 
previous timeframe. The friendship was more loosely and only slowly 
progressing but I had had hopes that it would grow with time. That 
was unnecessary now.
	I could not really say what I preferred from the two but 
strangely was more drawn to the first timeframe. Okay, I had died 
there, I had been a Senshi, fighting evil day by day. Yet, it had 
felt right and the close friendship with the girls was something I 
had valued albeit all hardships. Social contact had been something 
that I wasn&#39;t good at. All the studying and high grades weren&#39;t 
helping there. With Usagi-tachi I felt just in the right place. I 
belonged there. We were all outcasts in a way and that had helped 
enormously to breach the gap of suddenly having to interact with 
total strangers.
	My attention was drawn back to the present when Usagi and 
Mamoru separated and stood with us to face Queen Serenity. The 
deceased ruler of the Moon wasn&#39;t looking very good, her face was 
thick with worry and she kept sending rueful glances in our 
directions. Serenity took on a regal pose. &quot;First of all I welcome 
you, reborn Sailorsenshi of the fallen Moon Kingdom and I wanted to 
give you my thanks for defeating Beryl and Metallia and protecting my 
daughter with your lives.&quot; Her voice became quieter saying this. &quot;I 
know it must have been awful for you and I would have more than 
wished to let your personalities sleep without those memories. Sadly 
this option was becoming less and less available.&quot;
	Everybody was quiet, not really knowing what to say. Finally 
Minako who acted as if expecting all this, bowed and looked up at the 
Queen serious. &quot;We thank you, my Queen, but we were just doing our 
duty.&quot; Of course, we all knew, Minako didn&#39;t mean it like this at 
all. We had all felt it to be much more than a duty to protect 
Princess Serenity. Without Usagi we never had found together or 
harmonized the way we did. Without her we would have been lost.
	Queen Serenity smiled slightly. &quot;Of course you did, and so 
much more.&quot; She paused for a moment, then heaved a heavy sigh. Before 
she could continue, Minako spoke up again taking the words from her 
lips that slammed down with a heavy impact on everyone 
present. &quot;Sadly our efforts to annihilate the Dark Kingdom were not 
completely sufficient.&quot; Usagi, Mamoru, Rei and Makoto looked at her 
sharply while I just allowed myself to be curious. The poor girl was 
under enough pressure already. It was obvious now that Venus had been 
awake for awhile now. If I thought about it... There had been rumors 
of a Sailor V.
	Serenity coughed lightly, drawing the attention back to 
her. &quot;To my regret I can only confirm Venus&#39; statement. I do not 
really know what exactly you are facing but I can tell you that the 
signature of the energy is that of the Dark Kingdom henchmen. And 
since Venus already encountered one, it might be safe to assume that 
there are more. I wish I could tell you more or what they are up to 
but despite their close position I have no direct power over the 
mortal realm. Their presence is weakening me greatly.&quot; I looked 
alarmed at this as did the others but I think I caught on the 
implications a little early.
	&quot;Your Highness, what do you mean you are close to their 
position?&quot; Instead of Serenity it was Luna who gave the answer this 
time, with an audible disdain and outrage in her voice. &quot;An... 
associate of ours discovered the enemies base here. On the Moon.&quot; The 
room literally fell silent. For a moment no one said a word, when 
Makoto - not surprisingly - all but exploded and smashed her fist 
cursing through a support Pillar and Rei snarled angrily. I wished I 
had my Mercury Computer to confirm Luna&#39;s declaration but simply 
looked out of the window instead. As before I didn&#39;t see anything out 
of the ordinary.
	&quot;You cannot see anything from here,&quot; Serenity stated and I 
walked back to the others disappointed. &quot;This is merely an image in 
the astral plane. Also I cannot keep you here forever. The time for 
your mortal forms is frozen at the moment and all this you are 
experiencing here will just appear to be a spur of the moment.&quot; Her 
face turned serious again as a glow appeared above her left 
hand. &quot;You are needed in your world, the enemy is already there.&quot; 
That was then I remembered the Youma back home. There had been many, 
an awfully lot and I knew that this would be a hard battle we were 
facing. But there many people back home, also poor Naru and Hitome 
were still there.
	&quot;Well then, what are we waiting for?&quot; declared Minako 
impatiently with a surprisingly worried face.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Rei)
My eyes narrowed sharply as I took note of the barely concealed 
emotions coming from Minako. The blonde had always been a little 
impatient. From my viewpoint I had always thought she held a lot of 
her personality back and hid it behind the mask of the dutiful 
Senshi. And Usagi had never really told us about that night on the 
ship with her Youma-turned friend. There had been something deeply 
bothering her but somehow after the ordeal she seemed unnaturally 
relieved. As if a heavy burden had just been lifted from her 
shoulders.
	According to the cats and the dim memories I still had from 
my past life Venus was meant to be our leader, the leader of the 
Princess` guard. Yet that outburst wasn&#39;t a sign of leadership, it 
was a sign of deep emotional worry. Minako worried about someone 
specific back home, yet I couldn&#39;t remember seeing anyone with her 
when she approached us at the track course. Tentatively I reached out 
and probed a little at her spirit, trying to find any clue and was 
almost send reeling from the discovery. First there was something 
very powerful and ancient attached to her spirit, stretching out 
towards something... no, someone else. The band was pulsating with 
energy and I could briefly make out Venus&#39;s energy pattern before 
surprisingly sensitive mental shields snapped down and pushed my 
probing mind away.
	I quickly composed myself. The others didn&#39;t seem to have 
noticed and naturally agreed with Minako&#39;s idea. The blonde stared at 
me for a moment, hard, and I suddenly felt myself shudder. Her eyes 
briefly flashed with primal protectiveness that clearly told me I 
should better not try this again. I had never encountered something 
like this and was curious to say the least. But I valued my health 
higher than my curiosity and wisely chose to not voice the question 
burning on my lips. No, I better talk to Luna and Artemis about this 
first, I decided.
	Queen Serenity meanwhile had finished whatever magic she was 
working and I watched the small white sphere, It burst silently and 
gave way to a round brooch with a star design on the lid. The brooch 
hovered there for a second before floating over to Usagi. There was 
an intense flash of light that actually not more than a tiny sparkle. 
However, the energy produced by the Ginsishou blinded my senses 
briefly and I just caught it sinking gently into the brooch. &quot;It was 
the whole time there?&quot; Usagi asked stunned. Serenity nodded. &quot;The 
crystal is a part of you. Your soul, your heart. Never lose it.&quot; She 
then turned to us and I gasped as in a burst of red a tiny pen with a 
five-pointed golden star on top appeared in mid-air. In a circle of 
red the sign of Mars was engraved.
	&quot;Your bodies and powers have developed far enough for the new 
stage of your power. I believe you will find the boost useful. But do 
not overdo it, you might tire quickly from using too much power that 
you are not ready for...&quot; Her gaze just for the fraction of a moment 
held Minako&#39;s who had produced her own hensin pen. &quot;And not all of 
you have the means at hand to recharge.&quot; Minako quickly tried to hide 
a blush and I lifted an eyebrow but kept quiet, remembering her 
previous reaction.
	Before anyone could react to the statement, Serenity went 
on: &quot;Again I am sorry that I cannot help you further but I can feel 
that these enemies are different from what we know of the usual Dark 
Kingdom agents. Please be careful, my children.&quot; Everyone nodded as I 
felt a strong force pulling on my spiritual form. It was time to 
leave. The world needed us again.
	Minako made a hand motion and Ami, Makoto and I joined her in 
a loose circle. Usagi nodded seriously and stepped into our midst, 
Mamoru beside her. Our Princess lifted the brooch and looked everyone 
in the eye for a last time. &quot;Ready, minna?&quot; Everyone nodded and our 
leader summed it up simply with a grim expression on her face. &quot;We 
are ready, Princess.&quot; Taking the lead, she lifted her henshin wand 
and summoned her power.
	&quot;VENUS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;
	&quot;MERCURY STAR POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;
	&quot;JUPITER STAR POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;
	&quot;MARS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;
	&quot;MOON CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;
	There was something incredibly satisfying about the 
transformation into my alter ego. The fire enveloped me and made me 
whole. Where once was just a tiny distance there was none. The link 
that was the source of my unusual command over the flames was 
completed and I became one with the fire. It wasn&#39;t hot. No, burning 
away all mortal restriction and worries, my spirit was practically 
dancing from the intensity. My already sharp senses were overflowing 
with impressions and energy patterns. Not overwhelming but pronounced 
and each one with its own note.
	What was overwhelming though was the enormous evil presence 
suddenly smashing down on my new enhanced senses. My eyes snapped 
open to take in a good dozen of Youma all around us, people running 
and screaming. A mass panic had broken loose and we were right in the 
middle of it. For a moment I was not sure what we could do with this 
many people so close by. Wide range attacks were out of the question 
but I wondered how we should combat this many otherwise.
	&quot;Scatter and drive them away from the masses. Jupiter, Mars, 
follow me, Mercury, Moon direct the people out of here.&quot; And with 
that, before anyone could question Venus, she launched herself 
forward. I had no choice but to follow.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Jupiter)
The power rushing through me was incredible. My late training had 
given me the reassurance that I was already much, much better than 
the last time I had become a Senshi. With the enhanced strength 
exclusive to the Senshi of Jupiter, I could literally feel every inch 
of my body. The movements were more swift, the power surely more 
destructible and my speed greatly increased. Even better the ki 
reserves I had built up over the last months had practically 
skyrocketed. Before my training under my new sensei I had never 
noticed it since I didn&#39;t believe in such things. Even as a Senshi. I 
could understand magic but a mystical force of life energy right in 
every life form&#39;s being? Ok, I knew that there must be some kind of 
energy - after all Youma tended to collect it frequently - but that 
you could learn to really tap into this potential... Now, I knew. And 
the dimensions my Senshi form gave me were simply plain fantastic.
	Venus was next to me, what surprised me a great deal. I had 
expected her and Mars to fall back a little but my blonde friend 
seemed to have no trouble keeping up. She even seemed like she was 
simply jogging. &quot;Got some serious training, I see,&quot; our leader 
remarked with a grin. I could not help but return it. &quot;You&#39;re not bad 
yourself.&quot; And then we reached the Youma and jumped right into the 
fray.
	Keeping a tight lash on the magical and mystical energy 
raging inside of me, I laid into the first Youma with a furious spin 
kick. Dropping down I executed a leg sweep and while my opponent 
struggled to keep his balanced, jumped up and over his back, smashing 
both feet in his back. I didn&#39;t look back, not that I had time to, 
then I confronted the next one. Pouring some ki into my moves, I let 
my fists fly, dealing seven hundred blows per second. I guess I could 
take on my sensei in this form but wouldn&#39;t really try to 
deliberately play with fire. He was the best after all.
	Pushing through two more Youma I quickly realized that the 
initial surprise had worn off and it was getting harder to get hits 
in. To make things worse these things were much tougher than I 
remembered... or maybe they just were, Anyway, they took my crossfire 
of punches and kicks with only being a little winded and there were 
so damn many of them that I didn&#39;t have the time to concentrate on 
one for some time. Then I finally got to one I had pummeled 
previously, he was already up again. That was frustrating!
	Soon I found myself back to back with Venus while I spotted 
Mars leading a pair of Youma away from the moving crowd. Thankfully 
with the monsters&#39; attention drawn elsewhere the people&#39;s survival 
instincts kicked in and they were following Moon and Mercury&#39;s 
directing. That, however, made another problem. With most of the 
people gone, the Youma&#39;s concentration was now solely on us. That 
wasn&#39;t helping either.
	&quot;BURNING MANDALA!&quot; I ducked then the fire rings sliced 
through the air. They cut through an arm of one of the Youma that 
were following Mars and continued onward through the circle 
surrounding us, consuming one on spot. Looking back over my shoulder, 
I caught Venus&#39; grim look and noted that she wasn&#39;t even winded - 
neither was I, I had to admit. &quot;Time to get rough?&quot; She only nodded 
and laid into our enemies with a vicious shower of Crescent Beams, 
which she called just that. For a moment I watched as she exploded 
into a whirlwind of attacks, continuing to send out beams, showers 
and this strange heart chain that she handled with an ease that spoke 
of experience.
	So mesmerized by her graceful, flowing motions that would 
have impressed Sensei, I nearly missed the two Youma jumping me. My 
senses warned me a mere moment before contact and they just managed 
to rip some of my fuku. &quot;Hey,&quot; I shouted indignantly. &quot;That wasn&#39;t 
really nice.&quot; Drawing on the magical energy, I discovered, was much 
easier now. Throughout my ki training I had learned a new level of 
control that seemed not to be limited to the mystical. With a yell I 
let the blast go.
	&quot;SUPREME THUNDER DRAGON!&quot; True to the name a huge dragon of 
pure lightning jumped from the rod on my tiara, eating one of them 
alive and burning the other badly. A moment later the Youma had 
regrouped and were prepared for our changed tactics. From what I 
could tell, I had the sinking feeling we were facing elite troops and 
that in our first fight in years. Really not good.
	&quot;Duck!&quot; I did not even reconsider when I followed the unknown 
voice&#39;s command out of instinct. A moment later a green energy blast 
smashed into a wolf-like creature and sent it tumbling. Quickly 
rolling with the fall I sent it off balance with a minor ki blast. A 
blur of motions streaked past me and I watched stunned as a winged... 
elf flew by to drive its energy blade into the Youma. The elf turned 
and grinned at me. &quot;You okay?&quot; I nodded dumbly. &quot;Never felt better 
but I think I&#39;m hallucinating.&quot; The elf continued to grin while 
delivering an elbow to a Youma&#39;s chin that had tried to sneak up on 
her.
	Venus and Mars chose that moment to join us again and Venus 
simply gave the elf a quick, questioning look, no curiosity, no 
wondering. Just this exchange of deep worry that I had briefly 
witnessed earlier in my friend&#39;s eyes but hadn&#39;t given it much 
thought then. This was different, I realized. My attuned senses 
caught the elf whispering to Venus, something about &quot;she&#39;s safe now.&quot; 
I really wondered who &quot;she&quot; was. That wasn&#39;t the look of someone 
being worried over a friend.
	My dwelling fell short then Mars mumbled a barely 
audible. &quot;Uh oh.&quot; We had decreased the Youma to eight by now but then 
I looked up I saw that eight new were just coming out of hiding and 
immediately headed in our directions. They seemed to consider us the 
highest threat, rightfully so, and I had the feeling that wouldn&#39;t 
work out with just a few bruises either.
	&quot;Venus?&quot; I asked, unsure of what to do. Our blonde leader 
didn&#39;t need long for an answer. &quot;Then I say now, we get back to the 
others and regroup. They are too strong to fight ordinarily.&quot; As much 
as it pained my pride I could only confirm that. Before long we would 
be tired. Better to put all our forces together and work on something 
else. &quot;Mercury, we need cover! NOW!&quot; Venus&#39; called out over the 
disturbing noises of the approaching Youma. They were almost upon us, 
then the familiar mist filled the area like a thick blanket. 
Concentrating I found Mercury and Moon&#39;s energy pattern easily and 
sprinted towards them. I wasn&#39;t concerned about Mars and Venus with 
Mars&#39; grip on spiritual powers and Venus&#39; new, impressive skills. And 
the elf would find her way too.
	Sure enough Venus and the elf were already there when I 
arrived and Mars was right behind me.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Luna)
With a critical eye, I watched the battle progress. As Venus had 
ordered Moon and Mercury were staying back with Tuxedo Kamen and 
directing the panicking innocents out of the danger zone, Mercury was 
also running a scan with her visor and Mercury Computer. The actual 
fighting was progressing better than expected. Especially now that 
most of the innocents were gone and Mars&#39; had more or less broken the 
silent agreement of not using any magic. I had seen Venus in action 
before but this new level of skill and ease was even astonishing me. 
If I didn&#39;t know Priapos had been training Venus during their stay in 
England and constantly afterwards whenever the elf was around, I 
would have deemed what I saw outright impossible. Hopefully the other 
Senshi would soon be profiting from the Efadio&#39;s hard drill as well. 
She was not known as the best among the elfin warrior class for 
nothing.
	&quot;They have all acquired a lot of skill, even without the 
memories,&quot; I noted in a thoughtful tone. Mars senses were sharper and 
she seemed to be able to react to the slightest presence in her near 
proximity. Her accuracy had also heightened, given that her new 
attack hadn&#39;t been that less aimed than I had suspected it would. 
Venus was always the Senshi known for accurate attacks, while Jupiter 
was more leaned towards power. Mars often hovered somewhere in 
between.
	Speaking of Jupiter, I hardly could follow her, even with my 
sharp cat eyes and the trained warrior eyes that were still there, 
even after all this time stuck as an advisor in feline form. I knew 
the skill necessary and how much one had to be in tune with his own 
life force to achieve this level - even with the enhanced abilities 
the mantle of Sailorjupiter provided -, yet the tall brunette was 
flowing almost as flawless as Venus through the enemies&#39; ranks. Kicks 
and punches were delivered with sharpness and skill that was totally 
against the normal nature of a Senshi of Jupiter. She moved with the 
grace and confidence of a great Martial Artist and the blows she kept 
dealing out reached several hundreds per second. Some kind of special 
technique I assumed that benefited greatly from the Senshi form.
	During my observation the battle had taken a turn for the 
worse. Although Priapos had joined Venus, Jupiter and Mars, the 
enemies second wave as it seemed came out of hiding and they were 
forced to retreat towards us under Mercury&#39;s cover. I quickly had 
made a count and was by sixteen, hopefully there weren&#39;t any more 
hiding somewhere or this could really lead to disaster. I already was 
wondering how our Senshi would be getting out of this. It hardly 
seemed fair. The first battling they had to do was an all-out fight 
with dozens of highly skilled Youma that were apparently sent out to 
deal with us. This was definitely a setup. They knew this would be 
the perfect day for an awakening. And even though we had Venus&#39; kin 
sister&#39;s warning I had not expected that much of an effort. I had 
been wrong, we all had been.
	&quot;What do we do? There are too many of them,&quot; complained 
Mars. &quot;And they are stronger than Beryl&#39;s usually were,&quot; added 
Jupiter frustrated. Mercury furiously typed away on her computer but 
didn&#39;t seem to be any wiser, Moon looked a little scared. Everyone 
looked at Venus and Priapos. Once again I was thankful that we had 
the tactical genius with us, she and Mercury together should be able 
to be a great asset in that department later. But battle tactics also 
were Venus&#39;s territory, especially in the heat of the moment. To our 
benefit Minako was much more in synch with her past life as Hebe and 
therefore drew from even more experience.
	Just to underline my words, Venus&#39; head perked up with a grim 
smile. &quot;Okay, I got an idea.&quot; She turned to Moon, eyeing our Princess 
carefully. Tuxedo Kamen was standing next to her and hadn&#39;t left her 
side since the battle started - I doubted he would have been able to 
match Venus and Jupiter&#39;s skill anyway. &quot;Can you use the Ginsishou 
only as a focus? Not put your own power into it?&quot; I glared at the 
Inner Senshi leader sharply. &quot;She used the crystal to its full power 
once! I don&#39;t think Moon has the necessary control yet to take 
that...&quot;
	Surprisingly my charge interrupted me in a calm voice. &quot;I 
think that it is possible. Then I fought Beryl something unlocked 
inside of me and I began to understand how the crystal truly works. 
Serenity-okaasama was right. The Ginsishou is an essential part of me 
and I guess I can manage.&quot; I didn&#39;t like it but nodded reluctantly, 
yet failing to see the logic behind the question. &quot;Even so,&quot; I 
interjected again, continuing to frown. &quot;I doubt that even all the 
Senshi&#39;s powers focused and put together could deal with all of them. 
You&#39;d just had one shot.&quot;
	Venus simply smiled and in a soft tone replied: &quot;Not the 
planetary powers. I agree that this would be pointless. My plan is to 
use the crystal simply as an amplifier for a power matching its own. 
They could connect and spread out in one great shock wave,&quot; she 
explained, glancing up as the mist began to settle down and the first 
Youma could be seen moving in our direction. &quot;There is nothing as 
powerful as the Ginsishou,&quot; I pointed out. Again Venus smiled softly 
which unnerved me enormously. &quot;Yes, there is.&quot;
	And with that the blonde-haired Senshi gave me probably the 
greatest shock of my life ever since discovering Usagi was Serenity. 
She held up her hand and a gentle white glow formed over it, growing 
steadily in size and brilliance. With a bright flash the glow took 
shape. What finally hovered over Venus&#39; outstretched hand was one, 
single, crystalline teardrop. I recognized it immediately. &quot;Is 
that...?&quot; I breathed totally stunned into disbelief. I had heard 
stories, mostly from Artemis, I had read legends and myths, I had 
even heard Queen Serenity mentioning it once. But I had not thought 
it could possible be reality.
	&quot;Hai. The Venus Tear,&quot; Venus confirmed gently.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Venus)
I could feel the incredible power in my hands, the incredible power 
pumping through my veins, filling me, charging me with energy the 
more I let my emotions pour into the ancient crystal. The product of 
a myth we had all assumed. Who would have thought it to be true and 
brought to me in such a desperate time? The tear was said to be lost 
ever since the time the firstborn daughter of the first Queen of 
Venus had died. The crystal that had become her essence in an effort 
to safe her life had never been seen again and the story blurred into 
a myth over the generations. But it had been there, just like that. 
One day after my first heart-breaking encounter with Priapos who had 
still been controlled by Adonis at that time, it had been there. I 
was sure there was a hole in my memory but until now I had not 
figured it out.
	A loud howl coming from the first Youma pushing through the 
mist ended my brief trip down the memory line. &quot;Alright, minna,&quot; I 
called out, taking charge again. &quot;Everyone focus your powers and 
shield us. Do not, I repeat, do NOT add them to the Ginsishou. We 
will have enough to handle like that.&quot; The three other Senshi didn&#39;t 
ask one more question but immediately formed a triangle around Moon, 
me and Tuxedo Kamen, including Priapos and the cats as well. I 
glanced pleadingly at the elf. &quot;Pria?&quot; My kin sister gave a grin. &quot;I 
take what you don&#39;t get. Don&#39;t worry.&quot; I nodded thankfully and 
prepared. Channeling my emotions and pouring them right into the 
crystal tear.
	&quot;MERCURY STAR POWER!&quot;
	&quot;MARS STAR POWER!&quot;
	&quot;JUPITER STAR POWER!&quot;
	After a short pause I added my own. &quot;VENUS STAR POWER!&quot; 
Keeping it tightly under control I fueled my planetary power into the 
Venus Tear - something I had never done before - and began the slow 
process of carefully focusing and heightening the power. Moon had 
freed the Silver Crystal from her brooch and held it now high over 
her head. The tiara had vanished and was replaced by a crescent moon 
but I was sure the same was the case with me. Finally getting the 
enormous waves of my own planetary energy under control I sent it 
out. A bright orange-golden beam hit the Ginsishou and Moon visibly 
shuddered under the impact and the struggle to leave the crystal as a 
mere focus. From my own experience I had an idea of how daring it 
might be to draw some of the artifact&#39;s own power to steady the 
raging inferno that she tried to channel but all it would do, was 
making it harder.
	I trembled visibly under the strain of holding the steady 
stream of energy to empower the other crystal. I had brought the 
Venus Tear nearly to its limits, once. However, this was different. 
Unlike the Ginsishou, the Tear didn&#39;t have any safeguards. I had to 
control the whole power output. Most of the time I used it 
transformed, as a weapon, I also had channeled my own attacks through 
it, making them stronger. Sending my whole essence though I had never 
dared before.
	I felt myself connecting on a higher level with Usagi. I 
could literally feel her spirit, her soul, her very essence. It was 
similar to what Hotaru and I shared but still different. I knew she 
felt me too and was trying to somehow support some more weight. The 
connection was fragile and the energy bouncing wildly back and forth 
between us. The sensation was so intense, I thought I&#39;d lose control 
any moment.
	Reaching out, I held the Venus Tear in one hand and touched 
Moon&#39;s left shoulder with the other, further sharpening the 
connection. Biting down on my lower lip I struggled hard to remain in 
control of the energy. If I just gave in and let it all flow I would 
overload both my own reserves and the Ginsishou. I could not allow 
this. But it was so damned hard, how...
	I looked up in surprise as I felt new, stabilizing energy 
flowing through the connection. For the briefest of moments I had 
almost mistaken it for Hotaru&#39;s but quickly caught sight of Tuxedo 
Kamen... No, Prince Endymion. He had gripped my wrist holding the 
Venus Tear tightly and the other hand was resting on his princess&#39; 
shoulder. Immediately I sensed the prince&#39;s presence drawn into the 
circle. His energy was unexpected strong and for some reason, 
calming. Grounding, I concluded. Earth energy tended to have this 
effect.
	Welcoming the addition with open arms, I quickly pulled some 
of his power in and weaved it around the steady stream of my 
planetary essence transferring from one crystal to another. The 
crackling and previous unsteady and fluctuating energy beam began to 
settle down and became steady. Yet the strain remained, only now 
divided on three people.
	Agonizing five, long seconds later I decided it was enough. 
The Princess, Prince and I were perfectly synchronized now and the 
transference steady and almost complete. &quot;Lower the barrier, now!&quot; I 
pressed out through gritted teeth. I had no idea what was going on or 
how long the procedure had lasted but on the edge of my awareness I 
had seen the Youma smashing against the barrier of blue, red and 
green. I knew that there were only one single window of opportunity 
to pull this off. Subconsciously I had already submitted complete 
control to the more experienced Hebe, now Aino Minako simply drew 
back and let her past life do the rest.  The moment the shield fell 
we acted. Calling out in unison, all three of us sent a last ounce of 
power into the connection and then let it loose.
	&quot;MOONLIGHT WAVE!&quot;
	The stream of orange-gold ceased and the Ginishou flared 
once. That was the only warning everyone got before everything 
exploded in pure white as the wave of light literally swept over the 
whole area, extinguishing both the cries of agony and the unworthy 
life of the sixteen Youma that seconds before had been trying to rip 
us to pieces. The backlash was so powerful I was sure that my grip on 
Moon&#39;s shoulder must have become painful until it was too much and I 
was blown backwards. Stumbling a little, I finally dropped to my 
knees. My vision was blurry and my breathing irregularly. The 
presence of the Venus Tear had long since vanished back into 
subspace. But the Youma, there I was sure, had all been destroyed.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Moon)
I could not really describe how it felt. The best picture I could 
come up with was that I was inside... no, a part of a bright, deep 
ocean, together with Venus. Every outward contact with the world 
didn&#39;t register with me. I was aware that I existed but the where and 
how didn&#39;t matter. I simply did. The ocean was full of power. Energy, 
pure overflowing and consuming light. My being that was reduced to 
simply its spirit was aware of every sensation, every slight shift in 
the balance, every fluctuation, in- or decreasing of the power flow.
	The flow was like the stream of a river pouring into the 
ocean, collecting and mixing the new capacities to the whole. But 
compared to reality there never was anything going back. The fountain 
of steady energy, the Venus Tear, continued adding more and more, yet 
never received anything back. Wave after wave of light tried to 
gather in the endless storage capacity of the Ginsishou. Endless as 
long as the wielder could control it and knew his or hers own limits. 
Yet, since I simply collected my task was minor compared to Venus who 
fed the power. I understood, in this moments of joined souls, I 
understood that unlike me she had not the benefit of regulations. 
There wasn&#39;t a limit where her crystal automatically pushed back 
unless you deliberately wanted to cross this border. She had to 
control all of it. A task I didn&#39;t envy her for.
	Then, suddenly, there was Mamoru. Though I had no really idea 
how his energy felt like I could just tell it was him, not from the 
added hand on my shoulder but from the emotions of love, belief and 
support from my Prince. The flow that had threatened to literally 
float over the borders steadied and calmed down and then it was 
enough. The moment Venus stopped the flow I already knew it was 
enough. There was a thin link now between our spirits, connecting us 
to each other. Three spirits, one soul and that soul pushed forward 
to bring the collective energy up and towards its destination. I 
refrained from using my own energy but everything else was similar to 
fighting Beryl/Metallia and I took over the freeing of the enormous 
power that we had amplified, bubbling, waiting to be released.
	&quot;MOONLIGHT WAVE!&quot;
	And with that my conscious was swept away and unfamiliar 
images flashed before my mind&#39;s eye. Of Mamoru, no Endymion and me as 
Serenity in the Silver Millennium. Of secret meetings and the sweet 
but dangerous blossom of a love that could not be. But those were at 
least distinctly familiar. The next set weren&#39;t and I just knew it 
had to be somewhere from deep in Venus memory. A dark setting, a 
pitch black void without any trace of light, Venus locked in combat 
with a menacing man. Feelings of a struggle, a commitment, emotions 
of despair battling belief. Responsibility. Love. Love was the 
strongest, the source that fed all the others. Love for one, for a 
single person, a single soul, the one and only...
	Then the shift. Still the dark void but now there was another 
figure. I could not totally make it out. She almost looked like a 
Senshi, the fuku, the radiance. In her hand was a long staff of some 
sort, a scythe attached to the top... A glaive? Emotions from Venus 
again. Disbelieve, cold, icy fear, heartbreaking loathing, loathing 
at fate and destiny. Yet, still, always this unconditional, 
unyielding love, aching with trepidation and dread. Contradicting 
emotions. There was the love on the one hand and the fear on the 
other. However, there also was belief that I thought would see love 
through in the end.
	All this I experienced in the span of a few seconds. And then 
I finally looked up, I saw that there were no more Youma and I was on 
the ground in the arms of Mamoru, my Senshi hunched around me. I 
groaned and with the memories of the connection still as strong I 
knew that I was much better of than Venus would be.
	&quot;Honestly, minna,&quot; I scolded. &quot;Would you mind looking after 
Venus, yes? I&#39;m fine. I did this before, remember.&quot; Mars was about to 
protest but one sharp and a tired gesture to the crumpled form of my 
Senshi&#39;s leader was enough to silence her with an ashamed expression. 
Venus, steadied by the redheaded elf looked up weakly and smiled in 
our direction. I gave an equally weak smile back and allowed the 
Silver Crystal that was still hovering above me to float back into 
the brooch.
	&quot;I say that was enough excitement for one day,&quot; Jupiter 
commented leaning tired against Mercury who probably looked the 
healthiest of all of us. &quot;I agree, let us head home.&quot; Just as 
everyone was about to follow Mars&#39; suggestion, Venus let loose with 
another moan and weekly struggled to her feet, with the elf&#39;s 
assistance. I caught Artemis looking at her strangely for a moment 
and then simply shaking his head. &quot;I am not going before I made this 
run! I am not going to miss it three times in a row!&quot; Her protest 
somehow sounded lame backed by the stumbling and the fact she barely 
was able to stand upright even with help.
	The elf chuckled with amusement. Picking the disheveled 
Senshi up, she turned back to us. &quot;She&#39;ll be right back. She just 
needs a refill. Oh by the way, the name is Priapos.&quot; Something 
clicked in my mind and Serenity immediately made the connection. 
Before anyone could voice their puzzlement over the strange behavior 
of the two, Priapos took of and flew out of view. I glanced at Luna 
and Artemis but Venus&#39; partner was just shaking his head and Luna 
sighed audibly. I had the feeling we were not going to get anything 
out of them. Turning back to the recent battle side, I took in the 
destruction that was dealt. Compared to the intensity it was 
minor. &quot;Ok, let&#39;s clear up here and then change back. I have the 
feeling Venus will be back sooner than we expect.&quot;
	Mercury, Mars and Jupiter were to tired to get into an 
argument and simply proceeded to make quick work of some of the 
damage dealt, proceeding to remove evidence and leftovers from the 
Youma killed before the all-consuming light wave. I looked up at 
Mamoru and saw him returning the look with a similar expression that 
was even visible through the mask. &quot;You felt it too, didn&#39;t you?&quot; He 
just nodded and with that we proceeded with clearing the area.
	Thoughts about the strange sensation when my spirit joined 
Mamoru and Minako&#39;s still spun around in my mind and I tried to make 
sense of them. The memories were rapidly fleeing and it was hard to 
hold onto most of them. But one was burned there like a mark. The one 
with the unfamiliar girl. A Senshi probably. It was definitely a 
memory, yet I could not say, if from Hebe or from Minako. However, it 
was important. I knew it was important. Hopefully I could get 
something out of my friend but somehow I doubted it. The feelings 
accompanying the memory were painful. A tainted mark on her soul, 
incurable. An experience with both. An intense love and fear. Who was 
that girl?

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Hotaru)
The sun slowly began to set. The streets on my way back home were 
deserted now. Either Tokyo&#39;s inhabitants were still attending the 
evening festivals, went somewhere to party or had long gone back 
home. The marathon was over as were most of the other activities. 
Surprisingly after the Youma attack had been fought back by the 
Senshi the people had quickly returned. After last year&#39;s fiasco 
Minako apparently hadn&#39;t been the only one who thought it would be a 
shame to let a little incident ruin this year&#39;s marathon again. The 
field of competitors had thinned out a little but most of them came 
back as did the spectators. Even in a traditional land as Japan 
curiosity often got the better of a human being. There was not much 
to see anymore though.
	I had been worried sick after Priapos had flown me well out 
of danger. The signs of battle could be seen from far away already 
and I had felt Minako&#39;s frustration over the bond. There hadn&#39;t been 
any signs of exhaustion or pain since I kept a subtle, steady flow 
active from me to her and she didn&#39;t seem to have any problems with 
the actual fighting, only with the desperate situation. Considering 
that there had been so many Youma I could imagine why.
	But the impression had suddenly changed when I felt some 
intense energy channeling. The only thing I could come up with was 
that Venus was using the Tear. Yet, I had never experienced something 
like that. I had tried to give her some more energy but had suddenly 
felt my presence blocked and there once was Venus, encountered a 
massive sphere of first two, then three different auras. I had tried 
for some time to push through but eventually gave up. Moments later 
the wave of light could be seen in the distance and I had collapsed 
right on the spot from the backlash through the bond as the bond 
suddenly snapped back into place, together with all the emotions on 
the other side.
	The relieve only wanted to come then Priapos had come back 
with a severely drained Venus. I thanked whatever Goddess had come up 
with the concept. Venus energy was quickly refilled and she was 
healthy again in a matter of seconds, ready to take on the world... 
or at least the rest of the competitors. Reluctantly I had stood back 
when Minako had joined her friends again and soon afterwards 
fulfilled her promise to participate in this year&#39;s marathon. Other 
than the other Senshi who had watched the start I had the benefit of 
getting a good view on the whole race. Why? Well, not everyone has 
the courtesy that your mate&#39;s sister - or kin sister - was an elf who 
could give you a lift.
	Minako won in the end. I was not sure, if the absence of some 
participants because of the incident had anything to do with it, the 
energy boost or simply Minako&#39;s skill. But my guess was the latter. 
Not because she was my girlfriend. Instead I simply knew from 
experience that her skill level as a Senshi had greatly increased 
under Priapos&#39; training. I knew how swift, agile and quick she had 
become and there I had already been impressed at my first 
demonstration of Senshi skill. It reflected on her normal form as 
well.
	The victory had been a photo finish though. For the most part 
the field had been close together. Only after they had come a few 
miles close to the finish Minako and another girl, my girlfriend had 
later told me was a friend of one of her teammates, had deposed of 
the other competitors. I wasn&#39;t sure, if Minako hadn&#39;t been holding 
back a little. I knew for sure that she could move quicker, yet I 
supposed it was a mixture of carefully hiding her true abilities and 
some residential exhaustion. But she won in the end.
	I wished we could have celebrated or something but as to 
expect Minako was tired from the days events and I had to go home 
sometime as well. Home. There was a topic I despised. I hoped High 
School would come soon. Then I could get a dorm room with Minako or 
something like that - if my father and that bitch ever let me that 
is. I hated it. Where I had simply taken the coldness and loneliness 
in the big mansion as a part of my miserable life before and had 
shielded myself away in my room, now it was different. I felt better 
than ever, my health had been increasing steadily and there hadn&#39;t 
been any attacks since England. Artemis had more or less confirmed 
that whatever had caused it was gone and would not come back - I 
still wore the pendant I had obtained in England though. Just to be 
safe. Strangely with my returning health and the socializing that 
went with being in Minako&#39;s company, the distance and coldness of my 
father and Kaori had also increased. Father worked more, I rarely saw 
him for days sometimes and Kaori&#39;s stares were even more unsettling 
and icy than before. As if they were... angry with me for overcoming 
my symptoms.
	I could here voices from the living room area as I quietly 
slipped past. The door was slightly ajar. Hesitating for a moment I 
moved closer and peeked in, keeping my breath low as I listened. 
Kaori and father were speaking. The redheaded assistant was clearly 
agitated and I wondered what was going on.
	&quot;I tell you, Professor. There is no use for her anymore. She 
has refused the Messiah and in her current state it is impossible to 
force her again. Even more. I think Hotaru could be trouble with her 
association with the other girl. She is powerful and I feel the other 
soul already stirred in the child.&quot; What were they talking about. How 
could the bitch say something like that about me. &quot;But, she&#39;s my 
daughter...&quot;
	&quot;Quit that. You know more than I do what our mission is. The 
project must be brought to an end, let us concentrate on the other 
child.&quot; Concentrate? Other child? I did not understand what... Father 
sighed audibly. &quot;You are right, you are right. But we have to keep 
Hotaru close by, at least to keep an eye on her. Then we reject her 
now, we will surely draw attention, that is something we do not need 
right now. Proceed as planned, Kaori.&quot;
	Cast me out? Reject me? They... No... FATHER didn&#39;t want me 
hear anymore? What had I done to deserve this? I was frozen on the 
spot for several seconds and barely had enough time to hide in a 
corner then both father and Kaori filled out of the room. Familiar 
feelings of rejection and loneliness bubbled to the surface again and 
I could not control the sob wrenched from my throat. It was not fair. 
What had I done to deserve this? I had simply gotten healthy again. 
Wasn&#39;t that a course for joy? Why was father so cold? And did he have 
something to do with the condition that had haunted over six years of 
my life? Was it him or the bitch Kaori? Both?
	Tears began to run down my cheeks as I dashed upstairs to my 
room. I couldn&#39;t think clearly. Pain and feelings of betrayal were 
clouding my mind and my heart was clutched in an icy fist. Almost 
mechanically I threw some clothes and things into a bag and slung it 
over my shoulder. I had to get away from here. I needed time to 
think... I needed to see Minako. Otherwise I was sure that I wouldn&#39;t 
be able to sleep one second in this house anymore.
	Bolting down the stairs again, I quietly slipped out of the 
backdoor and made my way over to the Aino-ke.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Artemis)
Everyone had split up after the start of the marathon. I had stayed 
with the girls knowing that Hotaru and Minako would have wanted a 
little privacy. Now we were back at her parents&#39; place. It was close 
to ten already and Minako had been reluctant to let Hotaru go back 
alone after dark but I could tell she was really tired herself. This 
had been about one and a half hour ago now. Fortunately Minako&#39;s 
parents were on a business trip this week and wouldn&#39;t be back until 
four days short of her birthday.
	Minako was currently trying to concentrate on the news report 
over the... &quot;strange incident&quot; during the day in the Tokyo area. 
Nothing much was shown and the press appeared to be totally in the 
dark. There were rumors of Sailor V being seen but that was to be 
expected. We - even Minako - had tried to keep our cover low the last 
months, yet sometimes it was impossible to refrain from a public 
appearance. And as usual Minako always jumped at the chance of being 
in the spotlight.
	Actually I was glad that her quirkiness and good mood had 
returned with Hotaru. She had been mopping around after England in 
the first circle and the repeat year wasn&#39;t any better with the 
constant failures in the love department. Then Hotaru had come into 
her life and had drastically changed both of theirs. As annoying as 
my partner could sometimes be, I better liked to have her that way 
and focused in battle and not brooding and distracted. No, it was 
certainly much better that way.
	&quot;Go to bed, Minako. You can barely keep your eyes open.&quot; She 
didn&#39;t respond but turned off the television and just began heading 
upstairs when there was a knock on the door. It was soft and without 
my cat ears I surely wouldn&#39;t have been able to pick it up and so I 
was sure Minako didn&#39;t either. Then my partner jumped up suddenly and 
rushed out of the room, I didn&#39;t really need to wonder anymore who to 
expect at this late hour.
	As I had already concluded for myself, Hotaru was standing on 
the front porch, a light bag slung over her shoulder. Her appearance 
was ruffled and miserable. Shoulders sagged, eyes slightly red 
trimmed and cast to the ground. Then Minako opened the door she 
slowly looked up with a half smile that wouldn&#39;t have fooled a total 
idiot. &quot;Can I...?&quot; she started in a meek voice but my partner already 
had grabbed and pulled her inside wordlessly. I caught Hotaru&#39;s eyes 
briefly and could guess already what was wrong. As so often in the 
last couple of months since our return from England.
	Quietly, knowing that the two girls would prefer to be alone 
for their idea of &quot;comfort&quot;, I slipped out of the door just before 
Minako closed it again. It wasn&#39;t that they probably always planned 
on this but with their emotional bond as mates as strong as it was, 
things always tended to get physical, especially when both were tired 
and/or frustrated. I had learned this lesson long ago. Again I 
silently cursed Hotaru&#39;s family. The girl was doing so well. Gone was 
the shy mouse that I had first gotten to know in England, gone was 
the usual melancholic mood and the sudden health attacks. She was 
normal again, the demon finally cast out through... this particular 
events. Yet, somehow her family situation didn&#39;t seem to get any 
better.
	This was probably the fifth time in the last two months that 
she had come over and often stayed for several days. There was never 
a word said about it, the topic was avoided and every careful 
attempts of conversation in this direction immediately blocked. After 
the first two times we had given up on this. If not even Minako got 
her to talk, I didn&#39;t think anyone else could. It hurt though to see 
her that way, especially Minako but also me. I had grown to like the 
raven-haired girl very much. She had given my partner her spirit back 
and made her happy, that was more than I could have ever asked for. 
All complications all that mattered for me was to see my charge 
happy. And that she was.
	The night air of late October was cool. Here and there were a 
few lights from bars and similar establishment, most possible 
harboring some of the participants of this day&#39;s events. Soon I had 
crossed the distance to the Tsukino house and jumped up to the first 
floor window of Usagi&#39;s room. The light was out but the curtains 
opened. As I peeked in I could see why. Usagi wasn&#39;t there, only Luna 
was curled up on the mattress.
	With some rapping sounds I got her attention and after some 
fumbling with the window she slipped out on the sill next to 
me. &quot;Artemis,&quot; she hissed in a tired voice. &quot;I hope you have a good 
reason for showing up this late. That day was long and I want to 
sleep.&quot; I chuckled nervously. &quot;So do I.&quot; For a moment she stared at 
me, then rolled her eyes and sighed. &quot;Hotaru is over?&quot; I nodded. She 
knew exactly that my sharp senses couldn&#39;t stand their mating. Then I 
was already asleep there wasn&#39;t a problem apparently but I couldn&#39;t 
get one shut eye while they were going at it.
	With another shake of my head Luna motioned for me to follow 
her. &quot;Usagi has gone over to Mamoru for the night. Can&#39;t say I am 
surprised.&quot; I nodded silently and made myself comfortable on Usagi&#39;s 
cover. A moment of silence followed in which neither of us spoke but 
I could tell she wasn&#39;t asleep, instead watching me carefully. With 
an annoyed grunt I met her gaze, demanding without a word what was 
the matter. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t tell me earlier about the 
Tear.&quot;
	&quot;Luna, we had this already. We had no idea where it came from 
and neither of us likes to talk much about what has gone on in 
England. End of discussion.&quot; After a full period of thirty seconds 
Luna finally dropped the intense stare. &quot;Fine,&quot; she grumbled.
	Another two minutes went by. However, this time it was me who 
couldn&#39;t get any sleep. I still thought back to the wounded and 
abandoned look in Hotaru&#39;s eyes. I had seen it before but that was 
different. Whatever had happened, whatever she had seen or heard must 
have struck deep to the core and thinking back on that fueled a cold 
flame of anger inside of me. The ignorance of Minako&#39;s parents 
regarding most of her life was one thing but they were at least there 
for her.
	&quot;Luna?&quot; The black cat looked up sleepily and caught my 
worried glance with a frown. &quot;Can we put Hotaru&#39;s house under 
computer surveillance tomorrow? I don&#39;t think it has anything to do 
with the current threat but something is going on there.&quot; Luna nodded 
seriously. &quot;I guess we can do that. But I would not advise to make 
any moves before we dealt with this new enemy.&quot;
	&quot;Agreed.&quot; With that my eyes drifted shut. &quot;Goodnight, Luna.&quot;
	&quot;Goodnight, Artemis.&quot;

(Minako)
Exhaustion was immediately forgotten when I saw Hotaru stand in the 
door to our home. She looked so vulnerable right now, I thought she 
might break every moment. Before she could voice her request, I 
pulled her in, just barely registering Artemis slipping past, and 
closed the door. Gathering the younger girl in my arms I wrapped her 
up in a tight embrace. My mental shields went down without hesitation 
and I let feelings of love and security travel down our bond. The 
raven-haired girl immediately began to calm down and looked up to me 
sheepishly.
	&quot;Gomen nasei to bother yo...&quot; With a swift gesture I had bent 
down and kissed her. Our lips just softly caressing. I could feel the 
energy of our bond tickling and swirling but resisted. Neither of us 
were in any shape for that kind of activity and even though I could 
surely need the boost that would hardly be fair to my mate. &quot;Do never 
apologize for coming here. For what reason ever.&quot; Hotaru smiled 
slightly and I pulled her towards the stairs. &quot;Let&#39;s go upstairs. I 
am tired myself.&quot;
	Secretly I was glad that my parents were gone. They were 
paying such poor attention normally that there never was much of a 
difference but we always had to be careful then they were around and 
Hotaru stayed overnight. For them my girlfriend was just a friend 
from school or something, they never really bothered to ask. If they 
ever found out what really was going on, I was sure THAT would 
attract attention and cause trouble that wouldn&#39;t be healthy in the 
current situation. It wasn&#39;t that I could not stand up for my 
relationship but the time simply didn&#39;t seem appropriate. We were in 
the dawn of a new crisis and I didn&#39;t want to deal with personal 
problems.
	We walked up silently to my room and I closed the door behind 
us. Hotaru threw her bag in one corner and plumped down on the bed in 
more than a little frustration. Her eyes were unfocused and she 
stared straight ahead. I walked over to the bed and sat next to her, 
taking one hand in mine. Hotaru looked down startled at our joined 
hands and then back up to me with a slow smile gracing her lips. &quot;You 
can stay here as long as you want, you know that.&quot; The other girl 
didn&#39;t say anything as she simply leaned her head on my shoulder and 
I wrapped an arm around her. A peaceful silence settled over the room 
for a few comforting moments.
	Finally I suggested that we should better get to sleep and 
sent Hotaru to the bathroom first while I waited. She hadn&#39;t voiced 
it but I knew what went on in her head. Though the details of what 
was going on with her father and his assistance were still unclear to 
me and she wouldn&#39;t share them no matter what, I could tell one 
thing. Hotaru wanted to get away from there. But both of us knew that 
even though the care the two adults showed for my girlfriend was less 
thrilling than my own situation, I knew that there was no legal way 
to keep her away. It might be alright to keep her with me for a 
couple of days but longer... No, that would inevitably draw 
attention. I wished there was a way.
	After Hotaru was finished I went to the bathroom. Briefly I 
considered a quick shower to work the tension out of my systems that 
the intense fight with the Youma and especially the channeling and 
joining had caused. But I was too tired and simply wanted to go to 
bed. It was times like these that I cursed the side effects that came 
with being a Senshi. My whole body was alert and my senses tingling 
with anticipation. It was like being high without drugs and usually 
the only possible way to get the body to relax was through a cold 
shower or achieving relief... Senshi lust, I chuckled ruefully to 
myself. But I could not really bring myself to loath at it. After all 
it was at such a night, after a battle in England, from which our 
mating night had resulted. I was just wondering why I still was so 
far into the state albeit being tired. Especially the marathon should 
have helped to relieve myself from the rush of fighting. Yet, it only 
became stronger.
	When I entered back into my room, I fought down an urge to 
streak across the space between door and bed and simply jump my 
girlfriend. I didn&#39;t believe she needed that kind of comfort right 
now and... Ah, heck. Who was I kidding? It always lead to this. And 
Artemis knew it, that&#39;s why he fled the house so quickly. My inner 
battle must have shown in my body language since I caught Hotaru 
frown and getting up, discarding the nightshirt she had proceeded to 
just pull over her head. It didn&#39;t help matters that she wasn&#39;t 
wearing anything below right now...
	A low growl emitted from my throat as Hotaru came closer and 
reached out with one tentative hand against my cheek. &quot;You are still 
frisky?&quot; Coming from her that sounded almost as if it was a bad 
thing. I mean, I knew she didn&#39;t mean it like that, but hearing it 
from her made me feel dirty. I whimpered against her touch. &quot;Raven, 
I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t think we should...&quot; This time it was her cutting 
me off, as lips met in a much more demanding, quickly becoming 
passionate kiss. Tongues began to play and for a moment I simply 
enjoyed the sensation and the rising of the bond&#39;s energy around 
us. &quot;Never be sorry for wanting me,&quot; she whispered in my ear after 
pulling back and beginning to nibble on it. &quot;Let&#39;s forget our worries 
for the moment, we are all alone and we didn&#39;t a chance in over a 
week.&quot; Another growl and a moan mixed together then her hands slipped 
under my own nightshirt, seeking out the skin underneath.
	I already felt my control slipping and then her skilled hands 
found my breast, my breath caught and I could feel the dam inside 
breaking under the pressure of want, passion and lust. With an almost 
feral hiss and a speed the smaller girl couldn&#39;t quite register I had 
grabbed and thrust her around against the door, my hands beginning to 
roam her everywhere and my tongues pushing her back in a display of 
supernatural strength and dominance that Hotaru was well aware of and 
actually craving.
	A few seconds later we finally hit the bed but sleeping would 
come much later than planned.

TBC in Part 2

The Sailorsenshi are back together but their enemy isn&#39;t resting. Be 
sure to be there then Usagi-tachi meets Hotaru and new Youma show up 
on the scene!

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

Mars: Uhm... Ami? What are we supposed to do here?
Mercury: Don&#39;t look at me. Ask Usagi, she is editing the entry.
Moon: *sweatdrop* Well, I thought this looked a bit dull without a 
proper ending.
Jupiter: And what do you call a proper ending?
Moon: Easy! There must be a moral!
Jupiter: *eyebrow raised* A moral?`
Moon: Sure. Think back on all those Animes and TV Shows in the 20th 
Century, a lot of them had some kind of moral.
Mars: *slapping forehead in disbelief* Baka... This isn&#39;t an Anime 
and surely no kind of superhero show for babies... But then again, 
you would fit nicely in this category.
Moon: Hey! Mars, you are so mean!
Mars: *sticking out her tongue* You deserve it.
Mercury: *interrupting* I don&#39;t have time for this nonsense, there is 
a lot of work to do, including going over this file and correcting 
the errors.
Mercury has signed off.
Jupiter: I agree with her. Do your moral, if you want to do but don&#39;t 
bother us with that.
Jupiter has signed off.
Moon: Hey, where are you all going? What happened to loyalty here?
Mars: I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised. Although this does look a little 
suspicious here... Hm, come to think of it... Where were Mina-chan 
and Hotaru-chan in the first place?
Moon: *mumbling under her breath* I can imagine.
Mars: *shaking her head* Well, I have to go to. And at least now I 
knew why you wanted so desperately to write an opening scene!
Mars has signed off.
Usagi: Mars! *looking around* Now they are all gone! *Looks back at 
readers* Err... Gomen, minna! Do you still want to hear the moral, 
yes? I&#39;m telling you anyway, so don&#39;t bother to answer. Okay, the 
moral is... The moral is... *scratches head*... Uh... I had it all 
worked out, honest! They totally distracted me!
Luna (signing in): Usagi what are you still doing here? Get back to 
work, there is a delegation from Gaia waiting for you, did you forget 
about that!
Usagi: *panicked* Ahh, I&#39;m going to be late!
Moon has signed off.
Luna: *chuckling* Still the same. *turns to readers* I think the 
moral Usagi was aiming for was, that you cannot escape your destiny. 
The Senshi had wished nothing else than to lead a normal life, 
without the battles and tragedies. But at last their destiny had 
caught up to them again and they had to realize that responsibilities 
had to be taken in order to secure their future. I guess that will 
do, although I still don&#39;t see the point here!
Luna has signed off.

Author&#39;s Notes

That&#39;s it. The first chapter of TFG. I hope you all enjoyed the ride. 
Since I have no idea, if those who read this had already read the 
Prelude, I am especially curious, if I am depending too much on that 
(especially in the scenes regarding Minako, Hotaru and Artemis) or if 
it is just confusing at some point and not downright unintelligible. 
I tried to work with what I had in the Prelude with leaving most of 
the delicate details a secret. That&#39;s how I suppose their minds would 
cope with it. I mean why should they downright cloak/forget the 
entire time in England? This is POV style and I simply wrote it with 
the entire background in mind but being careful with some things. Do 
I even make sense?

Well now, what do I have to clear up about the first episode?
There are two intended cameos. I think it is easy to find the first, 
the second shouldn&#39;t be that hard either. At least from the detailed 
description of Makoto&#39;s fighting style and technique! This is not, I 
repeat, NOT meant as a crossover. I just made this cameos for a 
little fun and to give the Senshi the possibilities of fine-tuning 
their skills. I see, if I can get a cameo for Ami too... Just watch 
out.
Priapos is also a character introduced in the Prelude arc but will be 
in future chapters, so don&#39;t worry, if you can&#39;t associate much with 
her yet.
Usagi is more mature, Ami more socialized, Makoto more in control... 
Please bear in mind before you say I&#39;m being too OOC for a rewrite 
here, that the story takes place about two years later (one after the 
reset one). Usagi is fifteen, Minako close to sixteen and so forth. 
They ARE more mature and responsible.
The reset of the year. This is the theory that was used in a lot of 
popular fiction. I, myself am not so sure, if I really believe that 
Usagi really resets time and not simply wiped out everyone&#39;s memories 
about the events concerning Senshi activity. For me, that would be 
more plausible. But using this particular theory became an essential 
tool for the prelude and setting things in motion for this story. I 
simply had more time to prepare the characters.
The Taiiku no hi is a Japanese holiday held on October 10 in Memory 
of the Olympic Games in 1964. I have no ideas of how exactly it is 
celebrated, only vague information. What I described was probably a 
little overdone but consider this author&#39;s freedom. :)

That&#39;s all for now (maybe my beta finds something else I need to 
mention?), I hope you liked it. If I hooked you with the pairing of 
Minako and Hotaru please consider joining our group at: 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/starsinlove. Feedback is always 
appreciate and though I do not resent to begging, I ask to comment, 
review whatever. It helps.

Ja ne, yours
