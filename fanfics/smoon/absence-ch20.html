Laodameia started to get an uneasy sinking feeling in her stomach as she 
strained her eyes, trying to see into the mist that surrounded her 
suite. The mental connections she had to her youma were being cut at an 
alarming rate, the trauma of each creatures&#39; death feeding back to the 
pink-haired woman&#146;s mind. Desperately she reached out with her mental 
power, attempting to infect the thoughts of the Sailor Senshi and their 
male ally and in turn dominate them to her will. The demon cursed under 
her breath. It was no good; their focus was too strong. One Sailor 
Senshi had a barrier of pure hatred in her mind, berserker fury 
interlaced with an image of a woman with aquamarine hair. Another had a 
wall of duty and worry, mixed with an image of a girl with green eyes 
and a ponytail. The pathetic caped man, who was Laodameia&#39;s former 
prisoner, had revenge on his mind and also an image of the blonde girl 
with the odd hairstyle the demon had seen before in the raven-haired 
senshi&#146;s thoughts. That particular Sailor Senshi&#39;s mind was filled with 
ecstatic joy for some reason. It totally confounded Laodameia. Hadn&#39;t 
the girl nearly killed her friend only minutes before? The pink clad 
woman thought that of all the enemies&#39; minds *that* senshi&#39;s would be 
the most vulnerable. But instead she was met with an impenetrable 
firewall of determination weaved and strengthened with euphoria and an 
image of the same blonde girl in the masked man&#39;s thoughts. The blonde 
girl in question had a similar mind set, a barrier of determination, but 
with two images: one of the raven-haired Sailor Senshi and the other of 
the caped man.

Laodameia swallowed somewhat nervously and contemplated a strategic 
withdrawal. She most definitely didn&#39;t want to have to fight. The demon 
blanched at the vulgar thought. Her little brother was supposed to do 
all the fighting for her, or the youma were to in his stead.

&quot;I can&#39;t see anything in this blasted fog!&quot; Laodameia complained, waving 
her fan at the vapours in irritation.

The demon couldn&#39;t see a thing. If it weren&#39;t for the sounds of the 
battle she could have believed that she was alone in the room.

&quot;It might be wise to, er... leave discreetly, and give a report to Lord 
Makareus in person, my Lady,&quot; Aiaia suggest close by, a slight tremor in 
her tone.

Laodameia squinted her eyes in the direction of her assistant&#39;s voice, 
trying to make her out. She thought she could see a large dark blue, 
almost black, metal shoulder pad in the fog.

&quot;Preposterous!&quot; stated Laodameia, pretending to be unconcerned. &quot;Even if 
they do manage to destroy all the youma, they will still have *me* to 
deal with...&quot;

Aiaia remained quiet for a moment before Laodameia heard her voice 
again. &quot;Yes, my Lady...&quot; she murmured. Not the ringing optimism the 
demon was hoping for, but what did the youma know anyway?

Besides, how hard could it be to fight? Laodameia had seen Khairephon 
and youma fight all the time; it looked easy. And she was no pushover. 
Yes, it would be a simple matter to kill the Sailor Senshi and their 
friend. The pink clad woman nodded confidently, attempting to reassure 
herself.

Laodameia the seductress was startled out of her musings by a 
blood-curdling howl from the mists that slowly choked off into a rather 
disturbing gurgle. The demon&#39;s last thoughts before she dropped her 
human masquerade were that perhaps it wasn&#39;t entirely too late to run.

******

Sailor Mars stood beside Sailor Moon, panting as the fog began to clear 
and reveal the hotel room that had become a battleground, with the 
brainwashed human prisoners of war relatively safe frozen in chunks of 
ice at the back of the room, courtesy of Sailor Mercury. The gradually 
deteriorating bodies of youma were spread around the once finely 
decorated suite. There were shattered youma ice statues here and there, 
the destroyed parts of the sculptures dripping cold water onto the once 
rich carpeted floor. Other youma were riddled with red roses, creating 
bizarre and macabre bouquets. Even more were horrifically scorched, 
their skin and flesh melted like wax, showing blackened bones beneath. 
Some of those fallen youma also sported missing limbs, as if severed by 
a buzz saw blade. And finally there were dust piles everywhere, some of 
the brownish substance still floating in the air, slowly falling to the 
ground. All of the youma in Laodameia&#146;s suite that had challenged the 
Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen had met with Death.

Mars looked over at her three other companions, checking to see if 
everyone was all right. They were all still standing at least. Tuxedo 
Kamen and the two senshi besides Sailor Moon and herself all had minor 
flesh wounds, merely cuts and scrapes. Sailor Uranus also appeared to 
have a rather nasty gash in her side, however. But she didn&#39;t seem to be 
bothered by it, or even aware of her injury. Sailor Mars could relate to 
that feeling. Sailor Mercury gave Sailor Mars a small smile when she saw 
that the miko was looking at her, no doubt relieved that the 
raven-haired girl was still standing. The Fire Senshi then glanced at 
Sailor Moon next to her. She was panting heavily like Mars, holding her 
Spiral Heart Moon Rod tightly in one hand. But the blonde girl didn&#39;t 
have a scratch on her. And for that matter, Sailor Mars had suffered no 
new wounds either.

Mercury&#39;s mist finally dissipated completely, and Mars turned her 
attention to where the cushion throne had been, expecting to see a woman 
draped in pink silk. Her eyes widened as she looked upon the creature 
that was crushing the pile of cushions with its weight, bursting some at 
the seams and sending an eruption of feathers flying. The beast was 
huge, not as big as Khairephon had been in his true form, but still very 
large indeed. If the hotel suite didn&#39;t have a high ceiling, the demon 
would have had to stoop. The creature that Sailor Mars assumed was 
Laodameia was partially humanoid. The lower half of her body was that of 
a dark pink thick-scaled snake, but ended in multiple long tails, each 
one with a serrated spear tip made out of hard bone at the bottom. The 
top half of Laodameia looked like a woman&#39;s, except that her skin was 
covered in lighter, thinner scales of pale pink. The demon&#39;s head was 
largely unchanged, still with long wavy dark pink hair flowing down her 
back. Her face was slightly more reptilian however, with eyes similar to 
what Khairephon&#39;s had been like- demonic except pink rather than yellow.

Sailor Mars heard an audible gulp of trepidation from Sailor Moon as she 
looked upon Laodameia&#146;s true self. Oddly, Mars felt no fear. Sure, the 
demon was imposing and could probably kill her with a single impalement 
from one of her tails, but the Fire Senshi just knew that she would 
prevail and survive. She had made a promise after all. And with her 
princess by her side, what could possibly stop Sailor Mars?

&quot;Don&#39;t worry odango atama,&quot; Mars whispered out of the corner of her 
mouth to Sailor Moon, &quot;this thing is nothing compared to the creature I 
fought in Yokohama.&quot;

Sailor Moon nodded nervously, still gazing at the beast with wide eyes. 
Sailor Mars reached over sideways with her right hand and grasped the 
blonde&#39;s free one tightly, giving a reassuring squeeze, while her eyes 
remained guardedly on Laodameia. Sailor Moon glanced down to their 
clasped hands and then at Mars&#39; face, blinking. The Fire Senshi turned 
her head to face her princess and then gave her a wink and a smirk, 
causing the girl to blush.

&quot;I&#39;ve got your back... and you have mine,&quot; Sailor Mars whispered firmly.

Sailor Moon nodded again and smiled a little. She glanced over Mars&#39; 
shoulder and then let go of the miko&#39;s hand quickly. The raven-haired 
girl frowned slightly before realisation dawned on her. Mamoru. Of 
course.

&quot;You two are next...&quot; Sailor Uranus sneered threateningly at their 
surviving foes, interrupting Sailor Mars&#39; thoughts.

Sailor Mars turned her gaze to a smaller, human-sized figure that was 
standing near to Laodameia. It was heavily armoured in close 
interlocking midnight blue metal plates, which formed a suit in snug a 
feminine shape. Brightly coloured runes decorated the armour, most of 
which were pink. It hurt Mars&#39; eyes to look at the unholy symbols for 
too long. A round extra armour plate that shared a partial resemblance 
to an amplifier hung from the youma&#39;s collar. The only part of the 
creature&#39;s body that wasn&#39;t covered in metal was her head; the youma had 
a human female head but with pale blue skin and long, white hair tied in 
many thick braids which dangled down her back.

&quot;All of you *disgusting* humans will die here tonight,&quot; the youma 
growled, her face scrunched into an expression of hate and barely 
controlled rage.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; continued Laodameia in a raspy voice, two forked tongues 
flicking out of her mouth, &quot;it appears I&#39;ll have to dispose of you all. 
You are not *that* attractive anyway...&quot;

&quot;Look who&#39;s talking,&quot; quipped Sailor Mars, reacting to the jibe.

The youma turned her hateful glare to the sarcastic senshi. &quot;Lady 
Laodameia is the most beautiful creature in the multiverse,&quot; she stated 
through clenched teeth.

&quot;Not once we&#39;re done with her,&quot; replied Sailor Uranus.

&quot;Do you think that even if you do win that the threat to your world will 
end? My brothers will lay waste to this planet!&quot; Laodameia shrieked, her 
voice gaining a demonic timber.

Sailor Mars smiled grimly, her eyes dark, causing Sailor Moon to glance 
at her warily. &quot;You only have two brothers now...&quot; the Senshi of Fire 
remarked, her evil smile widening.

Laodameia blinked at Mars in confusion for a second. &quot;Makareus is...&quot; 
she began unsurely, before a smug smile began to form on her face.

&quot;No. Khairephon is dead and with him nearly his entire youma army,&quot; Mars 
grinned malevolently, &quot;slain by a ghost from the past... namely me.&quot;

Laodameia stopped smiling and simply stared at Sailor Mars. The armoured 
youma turned her head to the demon, looking concerned.

&quot;You lie... Khairephon would never lose to the likes of YOU!&quot; Laodameia 
screamed, her cry shaking the ceiling of the suite and making the 
chandeliers swing.

Sailor Mars shrugged. &quot;Death can&#39;t seem to hold me in its grasp... but 
it had no problem taking *and* keeping your brother and his followers,&quot; 
she said with a sinister chuckle.

Laodameia screeched and attacked Sailor Mars, her long tails striking at 
where the girl stood. The Fire Senshi back flipped out of the 
spear-tipped tails&#39; paths, aware of Sailor Moon diving to the right, as 
the demon&#146;s natural weapons impaled the floor in front of her. Sailor 
Mars flipped over twice using her hands before righting herself. 
Laodameia&#39;s tails retracted, ripping a hole in the floor, some bone 
spear tips with wooden floorboards stuck through them.

&quot;WORLD SHAKING!&quot;

Sailor Uranus launched an orange energy ball at the enraged demon, the 
sphere crackling along the floor at a tremendous speed. Laodameia simply 
looked at the attack and made no effort to avoid it. The energy ball 
smashed into a glassy barrier that suddenly appeared just in front of 
the reptilian demon with the force of an earthquake, but otherwise did 
nothing. The snake-woman lashed out with several tails at Uranus&#39; 
direction in response, causing the Outer Senshi to dive and roll under a 
circular, varnished, wooden table. The tails punched into the floor 
where the blonde had stood but then followed her dive, banging into the 
table and throwing it out of the way. Sailor Uranus cursed and threw 
herself to one side as the spears shredded the floor asunder.

&quot;SHINING AQUA ILLUSION!&quot;

Meanwhile, Sailor Mercury fired a geyser of water at the armoured youma, 
hitting her dead centre in the chest. The youma staggered backwards a 
few steps, her armour only partially being encased in ice. The 
white-haired creature adjusted her amplifier for a split second and then 
screamed loudly through the device. A soundwave rocketed out of the amp 
and across the room, blowing furniture out of the way and shattering 
windows in its wake. Sailor Mercury cried out as she was hurled 
violently backwards into a wall, breaking partially through the plaster. 
The runes on the youma&#39;s armour glowed briefly, and the ice from 
Mercury&#39;s attack cracked and fell off.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Sailor Mars fired an arrow of fire at Laodameia, only to have the 
glass-like wall manifest itself and block her attack. The miko swiftly 
ducked as a spear-tail stabbed at her. Mars reached up and grabbed the 
appendage firmly, attempting to hold it in its current position.

&quot;Sailor Moon!&quot; Mars desperately called.

Sailor Moon darted between more of the demon&#146;s spear-tails and looked in 
Mars&#146; direction, knowing what her bodyguard wanted.

&quot;MOON TIARA ACTION!&quot;

Sailor Moon threw her energy charged tiara at Laodameia&#146;s exposed tail, 
the frisbee slicing into the limb and then returning to her. However, 
the creature&#146;s scales were too thick to penetrate, the attack only 
flaking some of the dark pink plates off. Sailor Mars let go of the 
tail, no longer able to hold it steady. She leapt to her right as the 
tail in question slashed at her in retaliation. While Sailor Moon&#146;s 
attack may have not succeeded to its full potential, it had however 
provided some valuable information-Sailor Mars had noted that 
Laodameia&#146;s tails didn&#146;t have the strange force field that protected the 
rest of her body.

Tuxedo Kamen threw a rose with a shout at the blue skinned youma, the 
flower flying straight and true at the creature&#39;s face. The youma turned 
and casually swatted the projectile out of the air with a metal arm, 
deflecting the red rose into a wall. She let out another scream through 
her amplifier, the soundwave punching into Tuxedo Kamen with the power 
of a freight train, knocking off his hat. The masked man was pushed back 
along the floor and closer to the now broken windows, as he desperately 
tried to grab on to something and stop his wild slide. The armoured 
youma kept screaming a constant cry, never wavering in pitch or 
intensity.

&quot;SPACE SWORD BLASTER!&quot;

An intense beam of white light crashed into the youma&#39;s back courtesy of 
Uranus while she still nimbly dodged Laodameia&#39;s strikes. But the 
symbols on the creature&#39;s armour glowed brightly once again, 
neutralising the attack. Nevertheless, the beam was enough to disrupt 
her scream and give Tuxedo Kamen a chance to recover. The prince threw 
another rose at the youma, this time aiming at the amplifier. The 
white-haired creature smirked and gave a short, sharp cry into her amp, 
redirecting the flower back at Tuxedo Kamen with a small sonic blast. 
The masked man raised his eyebrows in surprise and quickly spun his 
cane, repelling his own rose attack.

&quot;MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!&quot;

Sailor Moon used her Moon Rod while Sailor Mars ran interference, 
drawing Laodameia&#39;s spear-tipped tails towards herself. The demon 
appeared to concentrate hard as a large red heart was launched directly 
at her, her glass shield straining against it. Sailor Mars ceased 
running and diving as the tails ceased trying to skewer her.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Sailor Mars took a chance and fired a bolt of flame at Laodameia&#39;s side. 
The arrow met no resistance and exploded on her waist, flaming pink 
scales flying all over the place. The demon gasped in pain but kept 
concentrating. Finally the giant red heart disintegrated, Laodameia&#39;s 
psychic shield prevailing. She turned a hateful glare at Mars, and the 
girl watched in horror as all the broken glass in the hotel room started 
to rise, the sharp points aimed directly at her. There was no way Sailor 
Mars could evade them all. She was going to be torn to shreds!

Sailor Mars heard her princess scream out as the glass spun towards her, 
certain to eviscerate the miko.

&quot;SHABON SPRAY FREEZING!&quot;

Sailor Mercury desperately filled the suite with her freezing bubbles as 
she leaned against the crumbling wall, her bones aching. The bubbles 
surrounded the glass- turned-blades in the room with soft, smooth ice. 
Sailor Mars covered her face with her arms as the ice balls pummelled 
her, shattering, but only causing bruises and minor cuts instead of 
slicing her to ribbons like the spinning glass would have done.

Sailor Uranus and Tuxedo Kamen bounded around the room, agilely avoiding 
the youma&#39;s soundwaves as the pair tried to find a weakness in her tough 
armour. Neither could get a clear shot at the creature&#39;s face; she was 
always too quick to block. The youma roared a sonic scream at Sailor 
Uranus, forcing the blonde woman to cartwheel out of the way quickly. 
The soundwave pounded into the already weakened wall and blew a section 
apart, sending debris down to the street below and opening the suite to 
the night air.

Sailor Mars acted on reflexes alone, dodging multiple stab attempts from 
Laodameia&#39;s tail-spears. She grunted as a floating chair hit her in the 
back of the head, dazing her. A spear bone tip tore across arm, causing 
the girl to flinch away but take another laceration along the neck from 
a second tail, barely missing the artery. Mars ducked as another tail 
thrust at her, only to have another gash appear across her thigh. There 
were too many; but all she could do was keep moving. Sailor Mars&#146; brow 
creased deeply, focusing on dodging only the most dangerous strikes, 
letting her body endure the ones that would cause merely superficial 
wounds.

&quot;MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!&quot;

Sailor Moon used her Moon Rod again, attempting to distract Laodameia 
and help Sailor Mars. The clear mental wall appeared again as the pink 
snake concentrated, holding back the red heart that would surely cripple 
her with will alone.

&quot;MERCURY AQUA RHAPSODY!&quot;

Sailor Mercury, her sharp mind taking the initiative, played her harp 
and fired ribbons of water towards Laodameia&#39;s tails, each water stream 
hitting one of the appendages and freezing it solid, the demon too busy 
concentrating on shielding Sailor Moon&#39;s powerful attack to defend.

Laodameia screamed in pain as the blood circulation was cut off in each 
one of her struck tails, causing her to lose her concentration and drop 
her psychic shield. She crashed through the red heart, her scaly hide 
doing little to protect her body from the powerful attack. Laodameia 
collapsed to the floor, her arms clutched around her torso tightly as 
she writhed in agony.

Sailor Mars panted hard, hands on her knees, exhausted from all her wild 
ducking and darting. But there was no rest for the wicked. She stood up 
and took a deep breath.

&quot;BURNING MANDALA!&quot;

Multiple fire rings shot out of Mars&#39; hands, each one crashing into 
Laodameia&#39;s scale-covered form. The demon howled in torment as she was 
burned, the less protected top half of her body taking the most 
punishment.

The armoured youma broke off her attack on Sailor Uranus and Tuxedo 
Kamen, and turned to her Lady.

&quot;No... NOOOOO!!&quot; the youma screamed through her amplifier, the soundwave 
blasting into Sailor Moon, Mars, and Mercury, propelling them across the 
room and away from Laodameia.

The youma ran to her Lady&#146;s side, tears rolling down her blue face. She 
knelt down and gently took a pink scale-covered hand in her own 
metal-covered one.

&quot;My Lady... I have failed you...&quot; the sobbing youma said, one hand 
stroking the demon&#146;s dark pink locks.

Laodameia strained her head upwards with some difficultly and looked at 
her distraught youma. She opened her mouth to speak but only a croak 
came out.

&quot;It&#39;s alright... you will be avenged, you and your brother... I *swear* 
it...&quot; the youma whispered, teardrops dripping onto her heavily armoured 
legs. She leaned forward and planted a tender kiss on her Lady&#39;s 
forehead.

Laodameia gazed into her youma&#39;s eyes, and a strange expression came 
over her face. As Sailor Mars watched on from where the sound blast had 
deposited her and her friends, she saw what resembled a flicker of 
understanding appear in the demon&#39;s pink eyes. The youma seemed to 
notice it too and gasped, more tears trickling down her cheeks, 
obviously knowing more than Mars about what it meant.

Laodameia let out a deep melancholy sigh and slumped her head down on 
the carpet, closing her eyes a final time, her muscles relaxing. Her 
body turned a sickly green colour, just like Khairephon&#39;s had before, 
and started to rot at an accelerated level. The seductress was dead.

The four Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen continued to watch the youma as 
the hand of Laodameia she held crumbled to dust in her grip. The 
armoured creature abruptly stood up and whirled around to face Sailor 
Moon, Sailor Mars, and Sailor Mercury, the speed of her motion leaving 
teardrops in the air behind her and cracking her braids like a series of 
whips.

&quot;Murderers! You will PAY!!&quot; she howled, the shockwave of her 
grief-filled cry smashing apart everything in its path as it shrieked 
towards the trio.

Sailor Mars and Sailor Moon dived to the left as Sailor Mercury dived to 
the right, the sonic shriek blowing a hole in the wall behind them, 
revealing the receiving room Sailor Venus had earlier confronted them 
in.

Tuxedo Kamen threw a rose at the youma&#39;s back, the flower merely 
ricocheting off the metal. The attack got the youma&#39;s attention however 
and she turned to face him, screaming all the while, causing already 
wrecked furniture to fly around and the walls to shudder. Tuxedo Kamen 
ran as fast as he could as the soundwave chased after him, but he was 
too slow, the blast crashing into him, knocking him out the huge gap in 
the wall and into a ten-storey drop. Sailor Uranus hurriedly leapt over 
the yelling youma and rode the remainder of the soundwave towards the 
falling prince. She reached out desperately, grabbing Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s 
fluttering cape before the man got blown further out into the empty air. 
With her free hand, the Outer Senshi latched on to the edge of the 
suite&#39;s half-ruined wall, holding on for dear life. If Uranus let go, 
she and Tuxedo Kamen would be carried totally outside of the hotel 
building, and to a certain death on the streets below.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Sailor Mars shot an arrow at the youma&#39;s back, the bolt colliding with 
the monster&#146;s armour and detonating. More runes glowed on the metal 
plates, snuffing out the flames as if smothered by a blanket. The youma 
ceased her scream and glared at Mars with red, hateful eyes.

&quot;MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!&quot;

Sailor Moon held up her Spiral Heart Moon Rod, glittering streams of 
heart shaped energy flying out of it and towards the youma. The streams 
coalesced into a single large red heart and the armoured youma crashed 
through it. The creature howled in excruciating agony as all the symbols 
on her armour flared up brightly, the light so intense that it forced 
Mars to look away. The blue-skinned youma dropped to one knee, some of 
the runes crumbling off her midnight blue metal suit. She gritted her 
teeth then laboured to her feet, ready to attack once more.

&quot;JUPITER OAK EVOLUTION!&quot;

Razor sharp green leaves collided with the youma like machine gun fire, 
ricocheting off the creature&#146;s suit and all over the hotel room, forcing 
fiercely her back. The white-haired youma stumbled backwards through the 
giant hole in the wall and fell past the climbing Sailor Uranus and 
Tuxedo Kamen, plummeting ten storeys to the busy streets below, 
screaming all the while and causing the windows on lower floors to blow 
apart as she sailed by.

&quot;Do I have timing or what?&quot; Sailor Jupiter grinned.

&quot;You certainly have something,&quot; Sailor Mercury answered, walking rather 
unsteadily towards the tall senshi.

&quot;You&#39;re hurt!&quot; Jupiter exclaimed with worry at the sight of her 
girlfriend&#146;s battered form and wobbly gait.

&quot;I&#146;ll be fine,&quot; Mercury said, hugging her love.

&quot;Damn it, Mars! I wanted to kill that snake thing!&quot; cried a frustrated 
Sailor Uranus, having just scrambled back into the suite with Tuxedo 
Kamen.

Sailor Mars shrugged her shoulders indifferently. &quot;Dead is dead,&quot; she 
said absently, causing Sailor Moon to turn a concerned gaze to her.

&quot;We should leave here, Laodameia had some sort of hold on the residents 
of this hotel making them believe that there was nothing going on up 
here. Now that she&#39;s dead...&quot; Tuxedo Kamen trailed off, his worries 
implied.

&quot;That means Minako should be back to normal! It was hard to explain why 
she was tied up to the doctors. I had to make up some story that she was 
loony, but she&#39;s going to be okay,&quot; Sailor Jupiter said.

&quot;And it also means that Laodameia&#146;s prisoners must be free of her 
control now too,&quot; added Mercury from her girlfriend&#146;s side. &quot;Mars? Could 
you thaw them out?&quot;

Sailor Mars nodded to the Senshi of Water and turned towards the several 
ice blocks that contained human beings. By some miracle they had all 
escaped severe damage during the battle.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

Sailor Mars set some broken wooden chairs alight near the prisoners, 
which would hopefully slowly but steadily melt their protective ice 
encasements.

&quot;I only froze them lightly; their hearts and blood circulations should 
recover normally but it would be best to call an ambulance just to be on 
the safe side,&quot; Sailor Mercury suggested.

Tuxedo Kamen groaned and staggered forward, his wounds from his earlier 
battle plus the confrontation with Laodameia finally catching up with 
him. Sailor Moon quickly ran over to the prince and caught him in her 
arms.

&quot;Mamoru! You&#39;re badly hurt, we should get you to a hospital,&quot; Sailor 
Moon said, concern in her voice and eyes.

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right, Usa-ko,&quot; the masked man replied, slinging an arm 
around his soul mate. He gave her a quick look over. &quot;It looks like you 
made it out just fine,&quot; he commented, noting Sailor Moon&#146;s uninjured 
form.

Sailor Moon blushed and glanced back at Sailor Mars. &quot;I... got lucky,&quot; 
she said quietly, and rather guiltily.

Tuxedo Kamen nodded absently. &quot;Let&#39;s go to the hospital.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m with you there,&quot; Uranus said, holding a hand to her large gash in 
her side and wincing. &quot;I&#39;m bleeding everywhere... didn&#39;t even notice...&quot; 
she finished in a whisper, looking down at her blood-covered fuku.

Sailor Mars watched as Sailor Moon supported Tuxedo Kamen as he walked. 
The miko looked down at her own bleeding injuries marring her fuku red. 
They were only flesh wounds, but they appeared pretty nasty. Why hadn&#146;t 
her princess come running to her aid? Sailor Mars&#39; face fell as she 
figured it out. Sailor Moon had only said those things to her before to 
keep her from killing herself. Mars had initiated the kiss after all; 
the blonde had probably just gone along with it but was freaking out on 
the inside. In the back of her mind the Fire Senshi knew she was being 
unreasonable, that Tuxedo Kamen needed help and Sailor Moon wouldn&#39;t be 
Sailor Moon without offering aid. But after the emotional roller coaster 
the whole day and night had turned into, Mars was in a very fragile 
frame of mind.

&quot;You guys go ahead,&quot; Sailor Mars said without emotion. &quot;I&#39;ll stay here 
and... watch the fire...&quot; She turned away from the entrance to the hotel 
room and her friends and watched the flickering flames from the burning 
furniture thaw Sailor Mercury&#39;s ice blocks with sad eyes.

There was silence behind Sailor Mars for a moment, and then she heard 
the footsteps of the others leaving. The raven-haired girl bowed her 
head and stared down at the floor, keeping the tears back with sheer 
force of will. It had felt so real, the moment Sailor Mars and Sailor 
Moon had shared, like it had actually meant something to her princess. 
Gods, Mars was a fool.

The girl was startled out of her reverie when a hand was gently placed 
on her shoulder. Sailor Mars turned around and was met by Sailor Moon. 
The blonde smiled at the miko.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be by yourself,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Afraid I&#39;d hurt myself or something?&quot; Sailor Mars said, a little 
harshly.

&quot;Nope. You&#39;re bleeding like crazy and you&#39;re not the type to go to a 
hospital unless your arms are about to fall off,&quot; Sailor Moon said in a 
matter-of-fact tone, &quot;and anyway, how are you supposed to reach that 
burn on your back by yourself?&quot; She raised her elegant blonde eyebrows 
expectantly.

Sailor Mars stared at Sailor Moon for a second. She then snorted, a 
slight smirk coming to her features. Abruptly the girl&#39;s face crumbled 
and she returned her gaze to the ruined carpeted floor.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I just thought that maybe... you had changed your mind or 
something and you didn&#39;t m-mean...&quot; Mars trailed off, the tears breaking 
through her will and dripping out of her eyes and onto the carpet.

&quot;Oh, Rei...&quot; Sailor Moon whispered, pulling the crying girl into a close 
embrace.

&quot;I meant every word I said, Rei... you&#39;re very important to me,&quot; Sailor 
Moon continued, before sighing. &quot;We should really talk about... about 
what happened...&quot;

Sailor Mars just nodded, her head resting on her princess&#39;s shoulder, 
her face near the blonde&#39;s neck. Sailor Moon caressed Mars&#39; raven locks 
soothingly yet somewhat nervously. The Senshi of Fire closed her eyes 
and enjoyed her true love&#146;s tender touch while breathing in her sweet 
scent.

&quot;What a night...&quot; sighed Sailor Moon. &quot;We should get you back to the 
Hikawa Jinja; people are going to find us if we stay here.&quot;

&quot;W-Will you come with me...?&quot; Sailor Mars asked in a small voice.

&quot;Of course! Who else is going to patch you up? You shouldn&#39;t have played 
&#39;tag&#39; with those tentacle thingies,&quot; Sailor Moon said in mock 
irritation.

&quot;Well someone had to get them off your back, you slow poke. If it wasn&#39;t 
for me, you&#39;d be a kebab by now,&quot; Mars retorted, her usual sarcasm 
returning.

&quot;Oh and who saved who from those tentacle things that last time? Hmm?&quot; 
Sailor Moon said expectantly.

&quot;Mercury,&quot; Mars smirked.

&quot;What? No! It was me! If I hadn&#39;t stepped in Mercury couldn&#39;t have done 
anything, and *you&#39;d* have been the kebab!&quot; Sailor Moon cried 
indignantly.

Sailor Mars smiled into her princess&#39;s neck. &quot;Thank you for saving me,&quot; 
she whispered softly. She wasn&#39;t referring to the time during the fight 
with Laodameia.

Sailor Moon hugged Sailor Mars a little tighter. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she 
whispered back, understanding implicitly.

Sailor Mars lifted her head from her princess&#146;s shoulder and looked into 
her blue eyes. Sailor Moon gazed back, slightly uneasily, a blush 
beginning to form. The miko moved her head forward, attempting to kiss 
her love and saviour. Sailor Moon quickly let go of Mars and stepped 
back, out of her reach.

&quot;We should get out of here,&quot; she babbled, &quot;police and ambulance people 
are going to be coming soon and they shouldn&#39;t catch us here and you 
need bandages and stuff... uh... so let&#39;s go.&quot; Sailor Moon turned around 
and began to walk briskly out of the late Laodameia&#39;s suite.

Sailor Mars watched her go, dumbfounded and somewhat hurt. She shook her 
head slightly and jogged to catch up.

Well, that chapter was long. I couldn&#39;t remember if Mercury&#39;s rhapsody 
attack froze things or not.</pre>
