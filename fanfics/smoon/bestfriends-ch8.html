<h1>Best Friends (part 8 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/desslok.html">Desslok</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bestfriends-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The alarm would have gone off at 6:00, but Ami woke up ten 
minutes early and simply shut it off.  Fortunately, she had no 
classes today, and thus all the more time to prepare for the 
afternoon. When Ami had arrived home last night, her mother had 
been nowhere to be found.  Instead, she&#39;d found a note in the 
usual place.  It said simply &quot;Quality Time, tomorrow, noon.&quot;  

With a yawn, Ami rose from her bed and began her morning rituals.  
While she went through some stretching routines, she began to 
prepare herself for the day ahead.  There would be more than 
enough time to gather her things for &#39;Quality Time.&#39;  Hopefully, 
there would be time to call Makoto as well, to apologize for 
running off like she had.  Ami&#39;s eyes closed and she sighed, 
recalling those last blissful feelings before her beeper had gone 
off and ruined the moment.  Though she was disappointed at the 
disruption, Ami knew that it was only a matter of time now.  She 
and Mako knew each other too well; there was no doubt about what 
they&#39;d both intended last night, nor about how they both felt.  

Idle fantasies about the events of last night would not get her 
ready for today, however, so Ami soon left them behind.  After a 
quick shower and breakfast sandwich, she headed into her 
&#39;office.&#39;  The small room had been advertised as a third bedroom 
by the condo association, but Ami couldn&#39;t imagine using it as 
such.  Between the bookshelves and the computer desk, there was 
barely room to turn around in there.  The various plaques and 
awards that Ami had won over the years were displayed in the 
sitting room, of course, so that visitors could admire Dr. 
Mizuno&#39;s parenting skill.  

Ami sat down at her computer and logged onto the university&#39;s 
registrar system.  She ran some requests and soon the printer 
hummed with activity as her up-to-the-minute grades and progress 
reports spewed out of it.  In a file cabinet, Ami found the 
portfolio she had prepared for her last session of &#39;Quality Time&#39; 
and she carefully reviewed the various &quot;To-Do&quot; and &quot;Goal&quot; items 
in the Post-QT Review there.  Gathering up the printouts and 
arranging them in the manner her mother preferred, Ami tried to 
anticipate what sorts of questions she might expect.  The only 
area where her performance had been marked less than &quot;Acceptable&quot; 
had been &quot;Academic Initiative.&quot;  That checkbox glared yellow, 
signifying &quot;Barely Adequate,&quot; mostly because Ami had only taken 
on five full courses this past semester.   Of course, she could 
have handled the sixth that her mother advised, but that would 
have meant losing her afternoons with the other sailor soldiers, 
and her evenings with Makoto.  

Four hours later, Ami printed out the final draft of her essay on 
what she had been up to since the last QT session.  Placing it 
into her portfolio with the other information, she noticed that 
she still had a little over an hour to spare.  With an 
uncharacteristic nervousness, she picked up the phone and dialed 
up Makoto.  Though she talked to Mako just about every day, for 
some reason today she found herself sweating and shaking as she 
listened to the ringing.  &#39;Oh please be home, Mako-chan,&#39; she 
prayed, anxious to escape into her friend&#39;s voice, if only for a 
little while.  On the sixth ring, however, Ami heard the 
characteristic sound of a machine picking up.   Unsure of what 
exactly to say, especially after last night, Ami just hung up 
rather than leave some sort of incoherent message.  Sighing 
heavily, she headed out into the sitting room to make sure 
everything was in order.  &#39;Tonight, Mako-chan,&#39; she promised 
herself, &#39;I will let you make it all better.&#39;

----------------
 
Makoto did not hear the phone ring as she entered the elevator in 
her apartment building.  She&#39;d barely had time to change outfits 
after classes this morning for her lunch date with Minako.  True, 
Minako wouldn&#39;t care what she wore, but those horrid cooking 
school uniforms were best not worn in public.  Unfortunately, she 
hadn&#39;t learned much today, since most of her consciousness still 
lingered in the events of last evening.  Makoto had been a little 
disappointed not to find a message from Ami when she&#39;d gotten 
back, but was not too surprised.  She wasn&#39;t sure she would have 
been able to leave a message either, given what had happened, and 
especially what had almost happened last night.  

&#39;She was going to kiss me,&#39; Makoto exulted for the umpteenth time 
that day.  Taking a deep breath, she calmed herself down.  Minako 
was very perceptive about matters of the heart and Makoto didn&#39;t 
want to get ahead of herself just yet.  While she was certain she 
knew what would have happened, the truth was that nothing _had_ 
happened as of yet.  No need to get Mina all excited about events 
that hadn&#39;t occurred.  &#39;Maybe by tomorrow, there won&#39;t be any 
doubt whatsoever,&#39; Makoto hoped.

Trying to think of anything other than Ami (difficult!), Makoto 
reviewed what little she had gotten out of Kenjo concerning his 
date with her friend.  Normally, he would have rehashed every 
moment with her in an attempt to deconstruct every nuance.  
Makoto hadn&#39;t expected that he would be very revealing about his 
date with Minako, given that Minako was also a close friend.   
She felt confident that if things had not gone well, she would 
have been able to tell, even if he wasn&#39;t willing to admit it.  
After their brief phone conversation, though, she was certain 
that it had not been a disaster.  Hopefully, Minako would be a 
bit more forthcoming.

After a pleasant walk, Makoto arrived at the little restaurant 
she had chosen.  Part of her training as a chef required her to 
visit as many different places as she could and this one was new 
to her.  

&quot;Mako-chan!&quot; Minako called, arriving only a few minutes later. 
&quot;Were you waiting long?&quot;

&quot;Just got here,&quot; Makoto informed her.  Stepping inside, they 
found themselves seated at a small, out-of-the-way table.  Makoto 
made a mental note to include lots of such private booths and 
other tucked-away spots in her own restaurant some day.  After 
perusing the menu and ordering, and the standard pleasantries, 
they moved onto the main event.

&quot;Ok, you&#39;ve resisted long enough, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako noted. &quot;I&#39;m 
very proud, but I know you&#39;re dying to know what I thought of 
Kenjo-kun.&quot;

Makoto smiled at the informality. &quot;Yeah, just a little.  First 
though, you ought to know that I&#39;ll be getting together with him 
on Saturday and he&#39;s going to pester me, so if there&#39;s anything 
you don&#39;t want passed along to him, you&#39;d better let me know.&quot;

Minako laughed, &quot;How about the things I _do_ want you to pass 
along?  And, is this a two-way street?  Do I get a full report, 
too?&quot;   She batted her eyelashes at Makoto enticingly.

&quot;Save your wiles for Kenjo,&quot; Makoto replied with a skeptical 
smirk. &quot;They won&#39;t work on me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right,&quot; Minako recalled, &quot;you don&#39;t like blondes.  I 
could always dye my hair darker, maybe cut it short....&quot;

Makoto coughed suddenly, just barely avoiding spraying her water 
all over the table.  Noting the reaction, Minako grinned.  She 
almost felt sorry for her two friends, remembering how much they 
all teased each other normally about their respective love lives.  
How much worse would it be when two of them were in love with 
each other!

&quot;In any case,&quot; Minako continued, not wanting to upset Makoto, 
&quot;the date went very well.  I hope you didn&#39;t put Usagi up to 
spying on us, though.&quot;

Makoto grimaced, &quot;I told her not to do that!  I guess that means 
she didn&#39;t listen?&quot;

Minako giggled, &quot;It&#39;s all right, no harm done. I&#39;ll get her back, 
when &#39;Mamo-chan&#39; gets back to town.  Kenjo is a very good guy; he 
was a perfect gentleman.&quot;

&quot;Too much so, sometimes,&quot; Makoto snorted. &quot;I can&#39;t recall how 
many times he probably could have won a girl over if he&#39;d just 
gotten up the nerve to make the first move.  I think he gets 
overly worried about coming on too strong sometimes.&quot;

Minako recalled how polite Kenjo had been when he&#39;d walked her 
home.  Though she&#39;d decided in the restaurant to &#39;punish&#39; him by 
withholding any sort of goodnight kiss, she would certainly not 
have objected to an embrace of some sort.  A handshake had been 
it, though.   

&quot;So, I guess it&#39;ll be up to me to get the ball rolling,&quot; Minako 
concluded.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Makoto exclaimed, eyebrows rising in an accusatory 
fashion. &quot;So, you&#39;ve already decided to see him again?&quot;

This time, it was Minako&#39;s turn to blush and stammer. &quot;Well, 
actually, we spoke last night and, well, we&#39;re going out again 
tomorrow evening.&quot;

Makoto reached over and squeezed Minako&#39;s hand.  &quot;That&#39;s great, 
Mina-chan! I&#39;m so happy that you two hit it off!&quot;

Minako nodded happily.  Just then their food arrived and 
conversation was relegated to a back burner.   As they finished 
up, Minako decided to see if she couldn&#39;t get some dirt herself.  
&quot;So, how was dinner with Ami last night?&quot;

A sudden rush of color to Makoto&#39;s face made Minako smile.  
Apparently, something was in the air.

&quot;It was fine, until Ami had to leave suddenly. Her mom wanted her 
home for some reason,&quot; Makoto noted with obvious disappointment.

&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; Minako asked.  It was very rare that 
Ami&#39;s mom made any sort of demands on her time.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Makoto lamented, &quot;I haven&#39;t heard from her since.  
She promised she&#39;d call, but....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure she would have called if anything was wrong,&quot; Minako 
reminded her. &quot;Ami is very good about things like that, and I 
know she wouldn&#39;t want you to worry.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Makoto admitted grudgingly. &quot;It&#39;s just that...well, we 
were having such a nice evening.&quot;  

Minako sighed. Maybe the two of them didn&#39;t need any help after 
all.  It was obvious that something had gone on last night, 
though Minako was certain, based on Makoto&#39;s reactions, that no 
admissions or revelations had been made.  Usagi had reported via 
email that morning that Haruka advised them all to leave things 
be.  Oddly, that had been Minako&#39;s first instinct as well.  With 
a sudden flash of foreboding, she realized that they hadn&#39;t heard 
from Rei yet about what she might have accomplished last night.  

&quot;Uh oh!&quot; Makoto said, standing quickly. &quot;I&#39;m going to be late for 
my next class.  I probably shouldn&#39;t have changed, but I hate 
wearing those outfits out in broad daylight.  I need to get home 
and change back into school clothes.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako reassured her. &quot;I&#39;ll get the 
bill and you can pick up the tab next time.  You go on, and, 
don&#39;t worry, I promise to let you know Saturday how things go 
tomorrow night.&quot;

&quot;If I get anything good out of Kenjo on Saturday morning, I&#39;ll 
let you know,&quot; Makoto promised. &quot;Don&#39;t wear him out too much 
tomorrow night!  I want him to be at his best on Saturday 
morning.&quot;  In response to Minako&#39;s arched brow, she added 
hastily, &quot;We&#39;re supposed to have a game of basketball!&quot;  With 
that, she dashed off.  

Minako leisurely finished up her coffee and took care of the 
check.  It seemed that things were moving along between Ami and 
Makoto without any assistance from her or her friends, but Ami&#39;s 
departure last night troubled her.  She decided a stop by the 
Hikawa Shrine might be in order.

----------------

Quality Time proceeded as normal, all the way up to the very end.  

Ami&#39;s mother had returned home at noon, almost precisely, 
bringing with her some Chinese takeout procured from a small 
place next to the hospital where she worked.  As they ate, Dr. 
Mizuno filled Ami in on some of her more interesting cases, along 
with the requisite Tokyo General gossip.   They&#39;d discussed 
various political issues and other general topics.  The lunch 
portion of Quality Time was always the most pleasant.  

After lunch, they had adjourned to the sitting room, where Ami 
presented her mother with the folder of information she&#39;d 
prepared.  As she reviewed the documents, Dr. Mizuno inquired 
about the topics Ami was studying, with particular emphasis on 
things from the pre-med classes.  As always, Ami&#39;s grades were 
exemplary and there was little for Dr. Mizuno to quibble over.  
In the area of &quot;Academic Initiative&quot;, Dr. Mizuno informed Ami 
that they would be putting off any discussion until the time came 
to select classes for the next semester.  Ami was quite relieved 
to find out that that particular battle had been postponed.  

Finally, by 2 or so, Dr. Mizuno set aside the folder.  Ami would, 
of course, prepare the Post-QT Review and have it for her 
signature sometime within the next 48 hours.   Removing her 
reading glasses, Dr. Mizuno relaxed back into the sofa, 
considering her daughter.  Truly, she was quite proud of Ami.  
She had always set the bar very high for Ami, but mainly because 
she knew what her daughter was capable of accomplishing.  Aside 
from her own solitary bout of youthful indiscretion, (getting 
involved with an artist of all things!) Dr. Mizuno had hewn to a 
rigid path all of her life.  Even that one incident had blessed 
her, though it was not one she would ever repeat.  Ami had done 
so very well for so long, that it was all too easy to forget that 
she was a young woman, one approaching the same age that Dr. 
Mizuno herself had been when she&#39;d had that fling.  

&quot;Ami,&quot; she began, &quot;you know that, as your mother, I am your very 
best friend and you can tell me anything.&quot;

&quot;Yes, mother, of course,&quot; Ami replied, as if by rote.

&quot;Is there anything you&#39;d care to share with me?&quot;

&quot;No, mother, nothing that we haven&#39;t covered already,&quot; Ami 
answered, feeling suddenly uncertain.  This was not going 
according to script.

&quot;I wonder, do you ever see that old boyfriend of yours?  Urawa?&quot; 
Dr. Mizuno asked, too casually.

Ami&#39;s heart almost stopped.  It was hard to determine which was 
more bizarre: her mother asking about her love life (her too?!); 
her mother mentioning Ryu; or her mother&#39;s apparent assumption 
that Ryu was an &#39;old boyfriend.&#39;  

&quot;I saw him recently, mother, but he and I were never...&quot;

&quot;He seems a fine, upstanding young man,&quot; Dr. Mizuno interrupted. 
&quot;Of course, you&#39;re much too young to get seriously involved with 
anyone, but once you are through with medical school, he is just 
the sort of boy with whom it would be good for you to associate.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I understand what you are asking me, mother,&quot; Ami 
tentatively admitted. 

Sitting up straight, Dr. Mizuno took a small card out of her 
jacket.  Handing it to Ami, she said plainly, &quot;You have an 
appointment with Dr. Kaneda on Saturday afternoon.  I had to pull 
some strings to get you in on such short notice.&quot; 

&quot;But mother, I just had a physical last month,&quot; Ami reminded her.

&quot;Dr. Kaneda is a psychiatrist, Ami.  He specializes in the sorts 
of disorders that affect young people,&quot; Dr. Mizuno explained.

&quot;A psychiatrist?&quot; Ami blurted out in disbelief.

&quot;Yes. I have reason to believe that you&#39;ve been dabbling with 
some things that are clearly not healthy, nor normal.  You have a 
bright future ahead of you and I will not see it sabotaged by the 
frivolities of youth.&quot; Dr. Mizuno stood up and moved to the front 
door. &quot;Now, I have to get back to work.  I think we will have 
some more Quality Time on Saturday evening.&quot;

Still struggling with this bombshell, Ami meekly pointed out, 
&quot;But, I usually have dinner with Makoto on Saturday evenings...&quot;

&quot;Yes, well, not this Saturday.  This issue with Kino Makoto will 
be cleared up for you by Dr. Kaneda.  You should be glad that 
your friends cared enough about you to make sure that you got the 
help you need, especially before things went too far.  I will see 
you on Saturday.&quot;   And with that, Dr. Mizuno departed.

Ami sat, shell-shocked, staring at the appointment card in her 
hand.  Why did her mother want her to see a psychiatrist?  What 
did it have to do with Mako-chan? Suddenly, horrifyingly, things 
crystalized in her mind.  Her mother thought that she... and 
Mako-chan...  &#39;But, how did she know?&#39; Ami wondered, before 
recalling that, technically, nothing had happened yet.  Laying 
down on the couch, she remembered what her mother had said before 
leaving, and spent the remainder of the day trying to figure out 
which &#39;friend&#39; had spoken with her.  Calling Makoto was soon the 
furthest thing from her mind.
