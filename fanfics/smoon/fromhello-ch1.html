<pre>One word,that&#39;s all was said,
Something in your voice caused me to turned my head.
Your smile captured me,you were in my future as far as I could see.
And I dont know how it happened,but it happened still.
You ask me if I love you,if I always will,



Makoto came home from her evening classes, depressed and sad. Her 
girlfriend of three years came to her today and just broke up with 
her. For no reason. All she said was that it was over and walked away 
from Makoto.

Poor Makoto. She hadn&#39;t even seen this coming. She had always treated 
her girlfrend with respect. She never pushed her too far, gave her 
space when she wanted it...Makoto thought she was doing everything 
right.

Makoto sighed and went to her bed room and turned her computer on. 
While it loaded up, Makoto cahnged from her school clothes in to her 
flannel green pj pants and into a white tanktop. She then brushed her 
teeh and washed her face. 

Coming out of the bathroom, Makoto sat down and clicked onto her 
internet service and logged on. After a fw moments of beeping, she was 
online. She clicked onto her &#39;mail&#39; icon. No messages. Makoto sighed. 
She had hoped her now ex girlfriend would email her and tell her she 
had made a mistake. But, she didn&#39;t.

Just as Makoto was about to lof off and go to bed, a little instant 
message box popped up:

Love child: Mako-chan!


Makoto looked to see who had sent her a message. Itwas a girl she had 
met on line one night in a chat room. The two had become friends 
instantly. Smiling slightly, Makoto answered her.

Tunder Rolls: Hey Mina-chan...

Love child: Mako-chan? Whats wrong?

Tunder Rolls:...Nothing...

Love child: Liar...something is. Is everything ok?

Tunder Rolls: Iie...

Love child: :;hugz:; Come on Mako...tell me whats wrong...I&#39;m worried 
now...

Thunder Rolls: ...Ryouseika and I broke up...=(

Love child: NANI!? Why!??!?!?!??

Thunder Rolls: ::shrugs:: I don&#39;t know....she just walked up to me 
today and just dumped me...

Love child: She didn&#39;t tell you why??

Tunder Rolls: ::shakes head:: Iie...

Love child: I am so sorry Mako...

Thunder Rolls: Its ok...I guess...

Love child: ::nods::...

Love child:...Mako-chan?

Tunder Rolls: Hai?

Love child: You know I love you...right?

Thunder Rolls: Hai...

Love child: :smiles::....do you love me too?

Tunder Rolls: Always...

Makoto talked with Minako a while more before saying goodbye and 
logging off. She crawled underneath her blanket, and reached over and 
turned her table side lamp off. Laying her head down onto her pillow, 
Makoto drifited off to sleep.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
(Next Day, Friday)

Makoto came home that afternoon, and flung her college jacket at the 
chair. Her bookbag landing on top of her jacket in the chair.

She walked to her bedroom, and logged on. Still nothing in her mail 
box. She sighed, and clicked on her AIM. No one was on line so she put 
up a note saying she was asleep, and she&#39;d get back to whoever 
messanged her and stood from her desk. She walked over to her unmade 
bed and layed down on it. She looked at the clock and gave a silent 
prayer, thanking the gods she had half days every friday, then closed 
her eyes, and drifetd off to sleep.

A few hours after Makoto went to sleep, she woke up to an annoying 
beeping noise. Groaning and opening her eyes, Makoto could see someone 
was messangeing her and wouldn&#39;t stop. Growling, she jumped up from 
her bed and went to her desk and sat down, ready to kill the person 
who couldn&#39;t take a hint. Looking at the screen, she was ready to tyoe 
a nasty message to the person, until she saw who it was.

Love child: Makoto???

Love child: ....Makoto??

Love child:...MAKOTO!? Girl, where are you?? You never sleep and leave 
your AIM up...answer me dammit! I want to know whats wrong!...

Makoto sighed and typed a message to her friend:

Thunder Rolls: ...Konnichi wa, Minako...

Love child: Where the hell have you been!? I&#39;ve been IMing you for 
over an hour!

Tunder Rolls: I was asleep...I didn&#39;t have a very good day today...

Love child:....

Love child:...Becoz of the break up?

Thunder Rolls: ::nods:: hai...

Love child: Gomen ne, Mako-chan...

Thunder Rolls: Not your fault...::sighs:: I&#39;m tired... I don&#39;t want to 
date ever again...

Love child:....Never?

Thunder Rolls: Never.

After a few moments, Minako sent Makoto another message.

Love child: Mako-chan....uh...I was wondering...How long have we been 
friends now? A year?..

Thunder Rolls: Around a year...give or take a month or two...why?

Love child: Well...I was wondering...If you weren&#39;t doing anything, if 
you&#39;d like to meet in person...

Makoto blinked. She never thought of meeting this person face to face. 
But, she didn&#39;t see why she couldn&#39;t. They both lived in the same 
town...They could have even ran into each other and never knew it;they 
had never seen what the other looked like, not even from a photo.

Love child: Makoto?...Are you still there?

Thunder Rolls: Uh...Hai. Gome ne, Minako...

Love child:...You don&#39;t want to meet?...Thats fine...I&#39;m sorry I 
asked...

Thunder Rolls: Nani?? Iie! I was apologizing for spaceing out. 
Uh...hai, I&#39;d love to meet you....when?

Love child:....Hows tomorrow afternoon?

Thunder Rolls: Thats fine...where at?

Love child: Do you know where the arcade is down town?

Thunder Rolls: The one with the fruit parlor?

Love child: Hai! My cousin works there...he runs the place.

Thunder Rolls: Motoki!?

Love child: You know him?

Thunder Rolls: Hai. He always sets me and my friends up with free 
shakes. He&#39;s really nice...

Love child: ::giggles: You don&#39;t know him very well...he&#39;s a brat. But 
anyway..Is that an ok place to meet?

Thunder Rolls: lol Sure. Say...3;30-4 pm?

Love child: :;smiles:: Hai.
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Makoto took several deep breaths before entering the arcade. She 
didn&#39;t see Motoki. He is either on break or not working today, Makoto 
thought. She didn&#39;t know why, but on the way over to the arcade, she 
had bought a bouquet of flowers to give Minako when she met her.

Makoto could only image what this girl looked like. They had never 
seen pictures of each other; never descibed what they looked like.

&quot;I feel like I&#39;m on a blind date,&quot; Makoto said to herself. 

She walked further inside the arcade, spotting several people sitting 
at the arcade&#39;s bar. Makoto walked past them, searching for a person 
she had no idea looked like. All she knew was the girl was a year 
younger than her; 19.

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto turned around and her eyes nearly fell out of her head. One of 
the people at the bar had turned and called out her name. And this 
person, this woman, was gorgeous! She had long, thick, honey colored 
hair, done up in a red bow. And her eyes were the bluest Makoto had 
ever seen.

Picking her jaw up off the floor, Makoto found her voice and said, 
&quot;Mina-chan?&quot;

Minako smiled. &quot;Hello Mako-chan.&quot;

Well,you had me from &quot;Hello&quot;
I felt love start to grow the moment I looked into your eyes,
You won me,it was over from the start.
You completely stole my heart,and now you wont let go.
I never even had a chance you know
you had me from &quot;Hello&quot;


Minako giggled, remebering how she Makoto had met for the first time. 
They had started out as friends, ofcourse, but it grew into something 
more. For a long time, even after they did start dating, Makoto would 
be very hard to level with. Minako thought it was because she was 
scared of getting hurt again.

Mianko stood from her place on the couch, and walked out onto the 
balconey, looking out over Tokyo. It had been four years since they 
were an &#39;official&#39; couple.

Minako smiled, remembering that night, three months after thay had 
started dateing...
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Makoto walked into her apartment, following her was Minako. She and 
Makoto had just ran into Makoto&#39;s ex girl friend.

Ryouseika had approached Makoto and Minako in the resturant&#39;s parking 
lot. Makoto and Minako had just came out from dinner when she had 
approached them, trying to &#39;warn&#39; Minako that Makoto was nothing but a 
heart breaker, and wanted nothing but sex from her.

Minako turned her head and looked back at Makoto, who had tears in her 
eyes. Minako turned back to face Ryouseika, and slapped her across the 
face. Minako then climbed into Makoto&#39;s jeep, Makoto doing the same 
after shooting death looks at Ryouseika.

Makoto had been so mad, she hadn&#39;t spoken to Minako the entire trip 
back to her apartment. Minako knew Makoto wasn&#39;t mad at her, but 
afraid if she spoke to her, Makoto may yell at her for no reason. That 
and she probably didn&#39;t want to talk about it.

When Makoto had gotten back to her apartment, she had walked right in 
and plopped down n her couch and closed her eyes. Minako queitly and 
slowly approached Makoto after closing her door. Sitting in front of 
Makoto on her coffee table, Minako leaned over and placed her hands 
gently on Makoto&#39;s knees.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Minako asked worriedly.

Makoto sighed. &quot;Hai, Minako?&quot;

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Makoto opened her eyes and looked at Minako. &quot;Hai...I guess. Just 
upset.&quot; Minako nodded. Makoto sat up, and patted the seat next to her. 
&quot;You can sit next to me.&quot;

Mianko didn&#39;t move for a few moments. Makoto looked at her and was 
about to ask what was wrong when Minako took Makoto&#39;s hands and stood, 
pulling Makoto up with her. Their bodies were very close together, 
being the couch and coffee table were so close, Their legs were 
somewhat intertwined and Minako was pressed up against Makoto. 
Minako&#39;s hands were still holding onto Makoto&#39;s, but they were at 
their sides.

Makoto looked at Minako. She had no idea what the girl was doing with 
her. Or to her for that matter. Makoto didn&#39;t know why she had gone 
this far with Minako. She had promised herself she&#39;d never do this 
again.

Minako released one of Makoto&#39;s hands and shyly raised it to trace 
Makoto&#39;s jaw line. Makoto swallowed her mouth suddenly dry, as 
Minako&#39;s hand came to rest on her neck. Makoto wasn&#39;t sure what Minako 
was doing until she had pulled Makoto&#39;s face down and gently kissed 
her...

Inside I built a wall so high around my heart,
I thought I&#39;d never fall.
One touch,you brought it down
Bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me that I wasn&#39;t going to love again
The last time was the last time I&#39;d let someone in

But,you had me from &quot;Hello&quot;
I felt love start to grow the moment I looked into your eyes,
You won me,it was over from the start.
You completely stole my heart,and now you wont let go.
I never even had a chance you know
you had me from &quot;Hello&quot;


Minako smiled. She leaned on the railing of the balconey, wondering 
when Makoto would be home. No sooner had she thought this, when a pair 
of warm arms circled her waist. Minako smiled more when she felt a 
pair of lips gently kiss her ear, cheek, and neck.

Leaning back into her lover, Minako closed her eyes and smiled more. 

&quot;Hello, Mako-chan.&quot;

Thats all you said 
Something in your voice caused me to turn my head
You had me from &quot;Hello&quot;
You had me from &quot;Hello&quot;
Girl,I&#39;ve loved you from &quot;Hello&quot; </pre>
