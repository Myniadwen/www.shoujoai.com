<h1>Best Friends (part 2 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/desslok.html">Desslok</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bestfriends-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Mizuno Ami was in a bad mood.  She didn&#39;t really know why, but 
she was.  At first, she hadn&#39;t even realized it, of course.  Such 
emotional states were certainly not the norm for her.  Her first 
clue was when she ordered extra hot fudge on her sundae.  The 
second clue came when she realized that, even though she&#39;d read 
the passage in question three times, she had no idea what it was 
she was reading. 

Since reading without comprehension was clearly a waste of time, 
Ami lowered her textbook and looked around the room.  She sat in 
the ice cream parlor that had served as a secondary clubhouse 
(along with Rei&#39;s temple) for her and her friends since junior 
high school.  Unfortunately, she sat alone this afternoon.  Rei 
had duties at her temple, Usagi supposedly was in class, and 
Minako had volleyball practice.  Strangely enough, it was only 
when Ami pondered the location of Makoto (at the gym) that a 
feeling of loneliness hit her.  Being alone was nothing strange 
for Ami, but loneliness was.  Thinking back to when it had 
started, she could only recall that brief conversation she&#39;d had 
with Shinozaki Kenjo, Makoto&#39;s friend.  &#39;I wonder why Makoto 
never mentioned that her friend was in town,&#39; Ami considered.  
&#39;Actually, I wonder why she never mentions him much at all.  She 
wouldn&#39;t keep it a secret if they were dating, would she?&#39;   For 
some reason, this line of thought was making her feel even worse.  

&quot;Ami-chan, do you mind if I join you?&quot;

There are few things more jarring than to have a friendly voice 
interrupt one&#39;s contemplation of their solitude and this was no 
exception.  Especially disconcerting to Ami was the fact that she 
recognized the voice immediately and it was no one she had ever 
expected to see.

&quot;Ryu-kun! When did you get back to Tokyo? Your school isn&#39;t on a 
break,&quot; Ami noted. 

Urawa Ryu took a seat across from Ami in the booth, setting a 
bowl of ice cream down in front of himself. &quot;Can&#39;t a guy check in 
on one of his best friends when she&#39;s feeling a little down?&quot;

&quot;But, I&#39;m not...well, I wasn&#39;t feeling down until just this 
afternoon.  How could you...&quot;

Ryu laughed, &quot;You haven&#39;t forgotten that I&#39;m a psychic, I hope! 
One of the benefits, aside from the good grades, is that I can be 
there when my friends need me.&quot;

Ami&#39;s voice grew a bit stern.  &quot;You promised that you weren&#39;t 
going to use your powers to improve your grades!&quot; she admonished.

&quot;I haven&#39;t been, I was just saying it was one of the benefits.  
&#39;Was&#39;, Ami-chan, not &#39;is.&#39;  Now, do you want to tell me what&#39;s 
the matter?&quot;

As Ami began to describe her day, in an attempt to pin down the 
source of her discomfort, Ryu couldn&#39;t help but lose track of her 
words.  She was so very beautiful.  The picture he kept in his 
wallet did her no justice whatsoever.  Though he&#39;d had 
girlfriends at college, those relationships never worked out, and 
Ryu was smart enough to know that it was because none of them 
could stand up against his image of Ami.  

Though he&#39;d tried over the years to resign himself to the fact 
that Ami was only interested in him as a friend, it was still 
difficult.  Ever since she&#39;d saved his life, so long ago, he&#39;d 
felt a bond to her.  He knew that she felt comfortable with him 
and considered him a close friend, but still, he always sensed 
she held something back.  More than anything, he wanted her to 
open herself to him completely, to share the feelings that he 
felt for her. Even though she&#39;d told him in no uncertain terms 
the last time they had met that she did not want anything other 
than friendship, he never gave up that hope that he could 
convince her to return his feelings.  When the vision of her, 
sitting alone in this place with an expression of exquisite 
melancholia, had come to him, he&#39;d boarded the next train back to 
Tokyo.  Somehow, he&#39;d known that this was a turning point in both 
of their lives. Besides, some opportunities were too good to pass 
up.

Focusing back in on what she was saying, Ryu noticed that she 
apparently had no idea why she was sad.  However, she kept 
mentioning her friend Makoto.

&quot;Maybe I just feel hurt because Makoto did not trust me enough to 
tell me that her good friend had come back to town,&quot; Ami 
suggested.  

&quot;It could be that you&#39;re feeling left out,&quot; Ryu replied gently. 
&quot;After all, Makoto is with that Kenjo fellow.  Usagi is all but 
married to that Mamoru guy, right?  And didn&#39;t you say that you 
hardly ever see your friend Minako because she&#39;s always out on 
dates?&quot;

Ami looked uncertain.  &quot;I&#39;ve never associated happiness with 
boys. You know that.  I suppose it would be nice to have someone 
special, to share my life with, but I&#39;ve always assumed that when 
the time was right, it would happen.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re getting older now.  Your friends seem to be moving 
into that phase of their lives.  Maybe that time is approaching 
for you as well.&quot;

Ami did not reply immediately.  Instead, she let her mind wander, 
toying with this idea of sharing herself completely.  It would be 
nice to come home after a long day at school to someone who took 
joy in her presence, to share a meal, tell about each other&#39;s 
day, relax in the safe, comfortable arms of someone you loved 
with all of your being.  Ami blushed as her daydream drifted 
further, beyond comfort, to the realm of tight embraces, hot 
kisses, shared passions...

Though he could not read minds (he was a psychic, not a 
telepath!), Ryu sensed that Ami was beginning to warm to the idea 
of a boyfriend.  Now, all that was left was to insert himself 
into that role.  Suddenly, a searing pain in his temples, a flash 
of light, and another vision.

***Ami stood on a balcony, looking out at the night sky.  Stars 
glittered dimly, almost completely obscured by the reflected 
light of the city below.  Over the rooftops, the moon hovered, 
almost full.  Though it was cool, she felt warm inside, 
completely at peace.  Someone approached her from behind and 
gently slid their arms around her waist, leaning down to rest 
their head on top of hers.  With a contented sigh, she leaned 
back against the one who was truly the source of her 
contentedness, her peace, her joy and happiness.  Slowly Ami&#39;s 
head came to rest on the soft, warm chest of her dearest love.***

Ami did not notice Ryu tense up as his vision hit.  She was truly 
lost in the realm of her thoughts, as she lingered in this 
fantasy of shared love and happiness.  Still, these strange 
memories kept interrupting.  

*A month ago, sitting with Makoto in her living room, watching 
television together:  Ami dozes off and Makoto leans over to 
wrap her in a blanket.  The scent of Mako&#39;s perfume and the clean 
blanket surround her as she senses the gentle touch of her 
friend&#39;s fingers sliding it around her shoulders.*

*Seven years ago, at a school dance: the touch of Makoto&#39;s hand 
as Ami pulled her out onto the dance floor.  Chills run up her 
arms and down her spine as she considers exactly how special and 
beautiful this woman before her is.*

A sharp gasp from Ryu brought Ami out of her reverie. 

&quot;Oh my! Are you all right?&quot; Ami asked with great concern, noting 
how pale her friend had become.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Ryu replied, catching his breath. &quot;I&#39;m fine, just a head 
rush, probably from eating my ice cream too fast.&quot; 

It wasn&#39;t him.  He didn&#39;t know who it was, but he did know it 
wasn&#39;t him.  Ryu certainly was not the most muscular of young  
men, but his chest had never been soft like that one had been. He 
could still feel the sensation.  &#39;I don&#39;t think any man has a 
chest that soft,&#39; he mused.  Needing time to regroup, he stood 
up.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ami, I&#39;m probably on the wrong track. You&#39;re a smart, 
independent young woman, what do you need with any kind of 
relationship.  I must have confused you with those silly airheads 
back at school. You&#39;re probably just worried about exams.&quot;  Ryu 
laughed, he hoped convincingly.

Ami smiled wistfully, &quot;I suppose you are right.  I do feel better 
now.  It certainly was sweet of you to come all this way just to 
cheer me up.  We didn&#39;t even get a chance to talk about you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine, we&#39;ll catch up later.  I&#39;ll be around for a few 
days, but I&#39;d better get going.  Got some stuff to take care of.&quot; 
Ryu bowed slightly and headed out.

After he left, Ami picked up her textbook, but almost immediately 
set it back down.  True, she was no longer feeling lonely, but 
she did have a lingering air of melancholy.  Out of habit, she 
wondered what time Makoto might be done with her workout, before 
recalling that she was probably with Shinozaki Kenjo right now.  
That thought brought a sudden pang inside of her.  

&#39;Mizuno Ami,&#39; she thought, &#39;none of this is doing you any good. 
If you are lonely, you should seek out a friend.  If Makoto is 
busy, then you certainly have other friends who are _not_ busy 
with secret boyfriends.  I&#39;m sure Rei is available.&#39;

With that thought in mind, Ami gathered her things, paid her 
check, and headed out to see Rei.
