<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 40 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch39.html">Back to Part 39</a><p><u>(Dark Void)</u></p><p>As Apollo fled through the darkness his head was abuzz with 
angry thoughts. The Martian and the Goddess of Neptune had narrowly escaped his trap; 
through some impossible means Ares had somehow grown a backbone during his final moments and 
had nobly committed suicide. If that were all, there would have been no need for concern. 
However, the God of War had passed his powers on to his chosen heir—the human that Apollo 
had tried to convince Neptune to murder in cold blood. Though it sorely pained him to admit 
it, he had miscalculated.</p><p><i>How was this possible?! It was perfect! It should have 
gone according to plan! </i>He couldn’t get it out of his head—that perfectly, smug look on 
the Goddess’s face when his meticulous plan began to unravel. The very insinuation that a 
mere <i>child </i>could match wits with him gnawed at his bones. While it was true that the 
Goddess may have been one of the key tacticians behind the plan, it wouldn’t have been 
successful if there hadn’t been outside interference; the bolt of lightning and Ares’s 
betrayal were all a result of the real tactician behind the scenes. But the daughter of the 
betrayer had been right about one thing: Like mother, like daughter. It infuriated him so 
much that he couldn’t wait to crush them.</p><p><i>If it weren’t for--Bah, never mind! It’s 
just a small loss. Ares was a useful puppet, but he was not the best. </i>His smile widened 
at the thought. <i>Soon, very soon... Just wait for me a little 
longer!</i></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>“World...”</p><p><i>What?! </i>Apollo spun on his heel 
as a golden light lit the 
darkness.</p><p>“...SHAKING!”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr---Swoosh!</b></i></p><p>With 
surprising ease the Sun God teleported out of the way and earned a grunt of frustration from 
his opponent. Slowly, silver eyes met dark green. Haruka instantly felt a chill run through 
her body.</p><p>“Oh. It’s just you.” Apollo remarked nonchalantly. “Well, what do you want? 
As you can see, I’m a very busy person you know, and I can’t afford to be late for an 
appointme--”</p><p>“Cut the crap!” Haruka shot back. Her outburst seemed to actually have 
taken Apollo aback. “Do you really think I give a shit about your ‘busy 
schedule’?”</p><p><i>What you did to them...</i></p><p>There was a heavy pause as Haruka 
panted to catch her breath. Her entire body was shaking with rage.</p><p><i>...I will never 
forgive you!</i></p><p>“As I see it, you’re just going to have to make some time. Better put 
it under ‘your funeral’.”</p><p>Instead of feeling rage, the God actually found her attitude 
amusing. <i>The brat has spunk. I’ll give her that. </i></p><p>“Since you already know who I 
am...and I, you, Uranus Haruka... I assume that introductions are not 
necessary.”</p><p>“Spare me the talk! Just die already!” Haruka lunged forward and the God’s 
eyes flashed.</p><p>“Amazing. Do you really believe that you can defeat me 
alone?!”</p><p>“HaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!! 
WORLD...SHAKING!!”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiIIIIRRRRR---Swoosh!</b></i></p><p>Apollo 
successfully evaded the attack once again, but this time he unexpectedly came face to face 
with his opponent. Before he had even blinked Haruka was on him.</p><p>“Take this!” Haruka 
leapt forward and threw a hard punch, grabbing only air, and spun around with a back kick. 
“Rrg! Would you stop jumping around already?! Hold still 
dammit!”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p><i><b>Bam!</b></i></p><p>Haruka hurled a punch at his face 
and this time the blow connected. Apollo hadn’t even blinked. His head angled slightly, but 
his eyes were still trained on her with deadly promise. A terrible feeling flashed through 
her body when Apollo grabbed her hand and twisted it. Haruka yelped in surprise and 
instinctively tried to fall back, but his grip was tight. She could only contemplate the 
blood rushing to her face when flung her like a ragdoll.</p><p>“AHH!”</p><p>Haruka hit the 
floor hard, but with a roll she was back on her feet. A little startled, she raised her hand 
again.</p><p>“World...SHAKI--”</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p>“Aggh?!” An orange bolt 
burnt her hand. She glimpsed Apollo’s own raised hand just as another was 
discharged.</p><p><i><b>---CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p>“AHHH!!!!!” It pierced her left leg and 
flared up briefly around her body. Haruka immediately dropped to one knee and tightly 
gripped her injured hand. Despite the spiritual protection she possessed in her transformed 
state, the gloved had been completely burnt off and the skin beneath it was suffering from 
first degree burns.</p><p><i>My hand—Errgh! It’s shaking so badly. I can barely move it! 
Dammit! Where did he get this kind of power?</i></p><p>“Please, is that all you can do? 
Against a weaker foe you may be able to pull off the same attack over and over again and 
somehow fluke out with a win, but as you can see your power is nothing compared to mine. You 
were a fool to challenge me alone, Uranus.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, I guess that depends on how 
you look at it.” The faint sound of chuckling reached her ears. “What’s so 
funny?”</p><p>“Hahaha...Oh, nothing much. It’s just, you’re so much like your 
predecessor...”</p><p>“What’d you say?!”</p><p>“He was brash and incredibly stubborn. A 
strong fighter though. Your face says that you don’t believe me, but he was young once too, 
though, I highly doubt that he’d remembered any of it. I have no idea how a kid like you 
managed to unseat him from the throne, but for that I suppose I owe you my thanks. It 
wouldn’t have been so easy to kill him if he were still a God.”</p><p>“Grr...” <i>This guy 
is really starting to tick me off! </i>Haruka whipped out her hand, wanting nothing better 
than to wipe that smug smile off of his face, but she hesitated when she noted that the 
atmosphere around the God was distorted. Although it was invisible, the wind told her that 
there was a large mass of vibrating energy around his form.</p><p><i>The sneaky rat! The 
moment I attack he will too.</i> Haruka took a deep breath.</p><p>“Yeah, well you might be 
right about that. He was a stubborn old geezer, but don’t you think it’s strange? A weakling 
like him was strong enough to take down the ‘King’ of the Gods. That kind of says something, 
don’t you think?”</p><p>Apollo’s smile never faltered, but she sensed a shift in his 
aura.</p><p>“Now who told you such a lie? Don’t tell me that the people of Uranus are so 
arrogant to believe that their God could defeat the ruler of the Gods by himself! If he had 
fought alone, he would have been crushed like the pest he was.”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“Maybe? 
Do you even know what you’re saying or are you just babbling now? Regardless of how long you 
intend to draw this out I <i>will</i> kill you and the others. Even as I speak your armies 
are being decimated.”</p><p>Apollo had been expecting the short-tempered woman to throw a 
tantrum, but to his surprise she was strangely quiet.</p><p>“...I don’t need their 
help.”</p><p>“And why is that? Tell me. Where is this confidence coming from? You were born 
a human, and lived like a scavenger for years until Uranus took pity on you and took you in. 
Compared to him you are nothing. You ascended the throne through sheer luck alone, and yet 
you still have the arrogance to believe that a garbage-eater such as yourself can even stand 
a chance against me?!”</p><p>Despite herself, Haruka found herself smirking in face of the 
rant.</p><p>“Setsuna.”</p><p>The mere utterance of the name prompted the Sun God to frown 
deeply. That was it. That was the face that she wanted to see.</p><p>“Setsuna is dead.” He 
finally remarked with a stern face.</p><p>“Heh. Did I hit a nerve? Well, I guess I shouldn’t 
be too surprised. She was your right hand man and she took you down like it was child’s 
play.”</p><p>The air around Apollo began to spark. “That’s enough!” He threw out his hands 
and a single beam of energy stormed out. Haruka rolled to the right but the energy flew up 
behind her and disengaged into five separate beams.</p><p>“What--?!”She dove to her left, 
hitting the ground briefly, and scrambled for balance as the beams tore into the black 
surface behind her.</p><p>“Hah!”</p><p><i><b>Crackle! 
Crackle!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>In her haste she leapt into the air to 
narrowly escape another. As she hung mid-air her eyes widened a touch at feeling two more 
heat sources shot under her airborne limbs. She had luckily missed three beams but where had 
the other two gone?</p><p>“Rgh!” Haruka hit ground and immediately sprinted as another 
curved around and gave chase. “Hah! Hah! Hah! HaH!”</p><p><i>Damn! T-These things just don’t 
know when quit!</i></p><p>She turned her attention back to where she was going and was taken 
aback to rediscover one of the missing beams. It was barrelling straights towards her. 
Haruka instinctively jerked her right hand but threw out her left at the last 
second.</p><p>“H---AH!”</p><p><i><b>Crackle! Crackle! Crackle!</b></i></p><p>She had 
deflected the beam with her powers, but she missed the one that had been trailing right 
behind it. “Shit--” The word had barely left her lips before it pierced her chest. A painful 
cry was wretched from her throat as the energy circulated around her form, setting her 
nerves ablaze as if they were on fire. While she was stunned the beam from behind had caught 
up; it abruptly swung through the small of her back like an uppercut and left a long burn 
mark across the skin. Haruka grimaced as she was thrust forward, unconsciously knowing that 
her wounds would not heal in this battle.</p><p>Before Uranus’s ruler could touch the ground 
again Apollo appeared below her. With one hand he grabbed her left shoulder and yanked her 
down into his uprising knee. <b>BAM! </b>Haruka’s mouth opened in a wordless gasp. She 
glimpsed the power-lust in the God’s silver eyes moments before he grabbed her foot and 
began to swing her around in circles. It was a painful, stomach churning experience until 
finally he planted his foot down and threw her with all his 
might.</p><p>“Augh!”</p><p><i><b>Crack--Thud! Roll...</b></i></p><p>When she finally lurched 
to a stop, she was seeing flashing lights in front of her eyes. Haruka lay doubled over on 
the ground, as the pain continued to bombard her vision. She couldn’t see anything, but 
there was a salty taste of iron dribbling down her nose.</p><p>Haruka was caught off-guard 
when someone grabbed a fistful of her hair and yanked her up onto her feet. Apollo briefly 
twirled her in his hold, and brought his other hand securely around her throat.</p><p>“Do 
you still think you can win?” He asked again.</p><p>Haruka gulped. As she deliberated for an 
answer, he lowered his free hand down her arm until it hovered just over her injured hand. 
Before Haruka could brace herself for the pain he dug his fingers into it 
tightly.</p><p><i><b>Crunch.</b></i></p><p>“AH-HHHH<i>HHHH</i>!! Son of a---!!”</p><p>“Well, 
do you?”</p><p>Haruka heaved for breath for a few seconds, before forcing a smile in 
response. “Are you deaf? I already said that I can! This dimension of yours-- you have to 
materialize to hurt me. But it goes both ways doesn’t it? Because I can hurt you 
too!”</p><p>Apollo was silent for a moment.</p><p>“Is that what you thought?” The laughter 
in his voice sent chills running down Haruka’s back. “Silly girl, you’re even more foolish 
than I thought you were. It’s true that I have to “materialize” to affect you directly, but 
what if I materialized while I was inside of you? After all, it goes both ways, does it 
not?”</p><p>He raised his hand and pressed it on the inside of her left shoulder-blade for 
emphasis.</p><p><i>He’s not--!!!</i> Her heart skipped a beat. Haruka jerked in an effort to 
struggle away but the hand around her throat tightened. She felt his arm drawn back for the 
final blow.</p><p>“This is the end. Goodbye, 
brat.”</p><p><i>S-ShiT!!!!!</i></p><p><i><b>SHhhhRRKK!!!</b></i></p><p>At that moment, a 
portal opened at the God’s backside.</p><p>“Back off!”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“Sparking…Wide 
Pressure!”</p><p><b>Sssssss----KABLAM!</b></p><p>“Arrgh!!!” The surprise attack hit dead on. 
Apollo was forced into a hasty retreat as the second round of fire lit the 
shadows.</p><p>“Shine…Aqua Illusion!”</p><p><b>KABLAM!</b></p><p>“Ami, take care of Haruka! 
I’m going to hold him off!”</p><p><i>Ami? Makoto?! </i>Haruka coughed for breath as she 
sensed the shorter woman catch her. Through teary eyes she could just make out Makoto’s back 
as she charged after Apollo. “Wait! You can’t take him alone!”</p><p>“HaaaaaAAAH!!!!” 
Makoto’s eyes flashed as she hurled a fistful of energy towards her opponent. The God lifted 
a hand in response and unleashed a blast of his own just as the green lightning lashed out. 
In an instant the white light had engulfed Makoto’s attack and was flying towards her at a 
startling speed.</p><p>“Makoto, look out!”</p><p>Makoto’s breathing hitched as everything 
turned white in her vision. 
<i>Wha---?</i></p><p>“Makoto!”</p><p>“Oof!”</p><p><i><b>Whup</b></i></p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!!!!</b></i></p><p>Both 
Ami and Makoto were sent tumbling to the floor as the white beam roared past and disappeared 
into the distance. But the reprieve was brief at best; the failed attempt at heroics 
appeared to only annoy the Sun God further. Apollo turned on the spot and began to walk 
towards the stunned pair with purpose.</p><p>“Are you all right?” Ami asked her 
friend.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine.” Makoto nodded back despite the faint ringing in her ears. 
“But we still gotta do something about <i>that</i> and fast!”</p><p>Apollo took another step 
forward when Ami suddenly dashed to the right and Makoto lunged to the 
left.</p><p>“Sparking…Wide Pressure!”</p><p>“Shine…Aqua 
Illusion!”</p><p><b>Sssssss----</b><i><b>Crackle! 
</b></i><b>BLAM!</b></p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i><b>BLAM!</b></p><p>Both friends gasped as 
the smoke cleared.</p><p><i>Ah! No way!</i></p><p><i>...Impossible! He’s still 
coming?!</i></p><p>“World...SHAKING!”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrRRRRRRR---Kablam!</b></i></p><p>A 
large backlash of wind swept throughout the area as Uranus’s attack struck true to its 
target. However, Apollo was still standing; the attack had barely left a small indentation 
where it had hit.</p><p>A chill ran down the goddesses spines as the man lifted his head and 
moved to straighten up. Haruka clenched her jaw as Apollo slowly turned his head towards 
her. What she saw made her sick to her stomach.</p><p><i>Shit...He’s gone berserk! </i>His 
silver eyes were glowing with a white light that reflected no sense of self. The group 
flinched when the invisible vibrating energy surrounding the God crackled once, before 
igniting into a white flame surrounding his being. The temperature of the surrounding air 
was climbing at an alarming rate.</p><p><i>What’s he doing?!</i></p><p>Apollo wordlessly 
lifted his arms over his head and clapped his hands together. The energy around him dove 
into the ground and pulsed around his form in the shape of a symbolic 
circle.</p><p><i>What’s this feeling?</i> <i>I know I’ve felt this before! </i>Haruka 
contemplated as the dimension began to shake all around them. As the energy around the 
circle began to rise up, she glimpsed a set of red eyes towering behind the Sun 
God.</p><p>“It can’t be--!! Stop him, he’s going to summon!” Haruka yelled. The memory of 
the twin-headed dragon they had encountered within the ballroom flew to mind.</p><p>As the 
others continued their attacks at a distance, Haruka tried her luck 
again.</p><p>“Sparking…Wide Pressure!”</p><p>“Shine…Aqua 
Illusion!”</p><p><b>Sssssss----Ka</b><i><b>--</b></i><b>BLAM!</b></p><p><b>Ka--BLAM!</b></p><p>“World...SHAKING!”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr---Kablam!</b></i></p><p>The 
combination of their attacks nearly threw Apollo off balance, but his spell had somehow 
managed to stay intact. Any minute now the summoning would be complete.</p><p>“NO!” <i>Why 
can’t we stop him?! </i>The spell circle was pulsing faster. Unfamiliar feelings began to 
assault Haruka’s mind. Anxiousness, doubt and fear—it all personified itself within the 
trembling of her injured hand.</p><p><i>This is as far as we can go? Is it going to end like 
this?! </i>They had thrown everything they had at the Sun God, and he withstood it all as if 
they were merely flies to be swatted away. All of their hard work, all the training they had 
to endure to obtain these powers had hardly even left a scratch...It was that thought that 
amplified the damage to her pride, especially considering her bold statements that she would 
be capable of taking down Apollo without any help.</p><p>Haruka was at a loss until she 
thought she heard Michiru’s voice call out to her:</p><p>“<i>Don’t give up!” </i></p><p>A 
spark of self-anger lit within the blonde soldier. “Don’t stop! Keep firing at him with 
everything you got!” She cried out to Ami and Makoto.</p><p>As the two Goddesses readied 
another assault, Haruka struggled to raise her injured hands up and began to summon up a 
portion of her power. Her entire body lit up with the golden 
light.</p><p>“HaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!”</p><p><i>If focused power won’t do it, then let’s try 
raw force! 
Take...THIS!!!</i></p><p>“HAAAAH!!!!”</p><p><i><b>Crackle-crackle-crackle-crackle-crackle!!!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Crackle-Crackle! 
Crackle!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Crackle! CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p>All of her attacks were met by 
an invisible barrier, but the unexpected blast had weakened the god somewhat. Haruka then 
flew into an all out charge and was halfway across the floor when she suddenly sensed 
another presence quickly 
approaching.</p><p><i>Huh?!</i></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p><i><b>SHhhhRRKK!!!</b></i></p><p><i><b>SHhhhRRKK!!!</b></i></p><p>“WOAH!” 
Haruka hit the floor as two orange chains flew over her head.</p><p>Makoto threw another 
blast at Apollo’s barrier seconds before the chains reached their destination, weakening the 
barrier enough that they flew straight through and slung themselves around Apollo’s the 
arms. The god gave a cry of outrage as his limbs were effectively constrained and her 
movements were temporarily limited.</p><p>“Wait a minute...those chains!”Haruka’s whipped 
her head around to the shadows on her left. “Minako!”</p><p>In the background to Makoto’s 
right there was another spark of light. Apollo instinctively tried to yank out of Venus’s 
grasp, but when he could not he planted his feet into the ground and braced 
himself.</p><p>Haruka whipped her head towards the familiar energy. 
<i>Huh?!</i></p><p>“Deep… 
SUBMERGE!”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrRrRrRRRR</b></i><b>---KABLAM!!!!</b></p><p>Apollo’s 
chest plate took a direct hit and was damaged.</p><p>“Michiru!”</p><p>The goddess of Neptune 
scanned the battlefield. Ami and Makoto were to her left, while Haruka was to her far, upper 
left. All three of her comrades had already received quite a beating she noted. Her other 
comrade, Minako, was positioned behind the Sun God and was doing her best to restrain his 
movements, but he was quickly breaking away from her grip. However, that still left one 
unanswered question hovering in the tactician’s sharp mind.</p><p><i>Where did she...? 
</i>Michiru’s thoughts were interrupted when the symbolic circle on the floor erupted with a 
blast of heat and light.</p><p>“NO!” She heard a string of curses spring from Haruka’s mouth 
as a double-headed dragon descended into the plane. Michiru herself felt her aquamarine eyes 
widening.</p><p>“What in the name of Neptune...?”</p><p>“Agh!”</p><p>“Minako!”</p><p>Minako 
was forced to cut her losses and back off as the beast stomped down beside the Sun God and 
broke the chains. A smug look of satisfaction formed on Apollo’s face as he sensed the fear 
in the air. The dragon seemed to agree and roared hungrily beside him.</p><p>“W-What is that 
thing?!” Makoto was caught off-guard when one of its two tails whipped around and crashed 
into her side. “GAAH!!”</p><p>“Makoto!” Ami rolled and briefly glanced to see her friend hit 
the ground. She materialized her gun. This time, without any hesitation, she whipped it 
towards her target and took aim. The round was initially aimed at the dragon but in a split 
second it dropped towards the Sun God.</p><p>“HaAAHH!!!!”</p><p><b>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! 
Bam!</b></p><p><b>Bam! Bam!—Swch!</b></p><p>“Huh?!”</p><p>All of her shots had been 
neutralized by an invisible barrier. On the floor, there was a separate circular symbol 
encasing Apollo within a revitalized shield.</p><p>“So, we can’t near him unless we beat 
that thing first?” Haruka muttered. “What was lazy-ass...YOU COWARD!!”</p><p>On the other 
side of the floor, Minako narrowly evaded the other tail. The woman leapt over it and rolled 
up in time to see that it was heading straight for Haruka.</p><p>“Venus…Love-Me 
Chain!”</p><p><i><b>BLAM!</b></i></p><p>The chain shot forward and deflected the tail 
upwards with a powerful thrust. Haruka acted instinctively and dove into the newly created 
space along the ground and narrowed escaped a painful blow.</p><p>“OoF! ...Stupid!” Haruka 
hissed through her teeth in pain as she accidentally had whacked her hand against the 
ground. It was twitching uncontrollably now but she bit her lip and got to her feet just as 
the beast turned one of its head’s towards Minako. With a painful gasp she summoned up 
another world shaking. But this time, she impaled the glowing ball of energy through the end 
of her sword. All the while, through the corner of her eye, she could make out Makoto, 
Michiru and Ami battling the twin to the side.</p><p><b>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! 
Bam!</b></p><p><i><b>Crackle! Crackle!</b></i></p><p>“Deep… 
SUBMERGE!”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrRrRrRRRRR</b></i><b>---KABLAM!!!!</b></p><p>The 
dragon faltered for a moment before its shook its heads. With a roar it unleashed a blast of 
air, forcing the team back. As the Goddesses were recovering from the surprise, two beams of 
light began to charge up in the dragon’s mouths. The spiritual levels of the surrounding 
dimension were falling rapidly.</p><p><i>It’s going to--!! 
</i></p><p>“HaaaaAAAHH!!!”</p><p>“Haruka?!”</p><p>“Stop! Don’t do it!”</p><p>Everyone turned 
their heads as the blonde rushed the creature head-on. During mid-dash she drew her sword 
back and aimed the world shaking at the dragon’s heads, while being fully aware that Apollo 
was waiting beneath it. The man’s aura had also flared up expectedly to take the brash 
soldier down.</p><p><i>I don’t have a choice! If that thing hits us then we’re all dead! 
</i>She was about to swing forward when one of the two heads suddenly blew up. Its twin 
swirled around in shock. Apollo caught a glint of red light behind him as the mysterious 
soldier released a second strike.</p><p>“...Flame Sniper.” Another fiery arrow was shot and, 
with a deafening explosion, the second head also disappeared in a flash of 
light.</p><p>Minako felt her eyes widening in complete shock. “I can’t believe it...” She 
whispered to herself.</p><p>In the distance, she could hear Haruka finishing her assault on 
the beast. Throwing her entire weight into the strike, the sword pierced pierced its chest; 
the world shaking tore up the monster from the inside-out and split it into two. Everyone 
had to clear to area as multiple explosions rocked the 
vicinity.</p><p><i><b>KABLAAAAAAM!!!!!!</b></i></p><p>Haruka was thrown aside by the blast 
and landed in front of the mysterious person’s feet. “About time you—you...” She looked up 
and had intended to greet her friend until she saw the golden light brimming around 
her.</p><p><i>Oh no...</i></p><p>“REI!” <i>She’s alive! </i>Minako called to her but the 
woman didn’t look back. Her gaze was trained on something else. “Rei...?” <i>That 
light...</i></p><p>The atmosphere amongst the group of Goddesses grew tense at this 
unexpected predicament, but the one who was worried the most at the moment was Haruka. The 
blonde was close to sweating bullets. Why wasn’t Michiru coming to help her?</p><p><i>She’s 
really going to use that power again? Sure, it’s powerful, but what good does that do if you 
go berserk?! </i>That was when a strange thought hit her. <i>Wait a minute. But that attack 
that she just used... I don’t remember her ever using something like that before. That was 
Rei wasn’t it? </i></p><p>Haruka gasped and threw her hands up when Rei lifted her hand. She 
was instead surprised when Rei reverted back to her normal, suit of armor 
form.</p><p>“Relax,” Rei said calmly as she withdrew the sword from her side. “This isn’t 
for you.”</p><p>It took a few seconds for her friend to realize that Rei had actually 
spoken. But that wasn’t all that had shocked her.</p><p>“Rei. That form just now... How were 
you able to access that kind of power?”</p><p>“It’s complicated.” Rei muttered. “I’ll tell 
you about it later...”</p><p>Haruka heard a sad undertone in her voice, but the 
determination in her eyes said a lot more. She was angry, and ready for a 
fight.</p><p>“Wait! It’s good that you’re stronger now, but don’t even think about taking 
him on by yourself! He’ll kill you.” Behind them, the shield around Apollo fell. The God 
withdrew his weapon and brandished his sword as he turned to face them.</p><p>“I can do this 
Haruka.”</p><p>“What? Didn’t you just hear a word I said?! He’s already gone berserk! 
There’s no way I’m going to let you—Ah!” Haruka was forced to step back as the golden light 
around Rei flared up again with vengeance.</p><p>As her powers continued to manifest, Rei 
felt everything begin to change again. Her senses were becoming sharper; her sense of smell, 
her hearing—she could hear every heartbeat within the vicinity, all except for the single 
entity that stood before her. Everything and everyone disappeared from Rei’s vision until 
all she could see was the enemy. For a split second a fierce, almost animalistic instinct 
threatened to take her over, but now that she was aware of its presence it was easily put 
back to rest. Rei was indeed angry, but she was also perfectly sane. If she was going to get 
revenge it was going to be on her own terms.</p><p><i>I’m going to wipe that stupid smirk 
right off of your face! </i>Rei swung her sword around and charged forward. Apollo eagerly 
ran forward to meet the challenge. In an instant he dove low and swung up as she swooped 
down.</p><p>“HaaaaAAAAHHH!!!”</p><p>“HWOOOOOO!!”</p><p><i><b>TINZ--FWooOOOOOOOSSSH!!!!!!!!!</b></i></p><p>The 
first collision of their blades discharged a powerful wave of energy. The other women in the 
vicinity braced themselves and clung to one another to avoid being swept away by the fierce 
winds.</p><p><i>W-What power! </i>The sheer magnitude of their spiritual pressures was 
putting the dimension’s stability at risk. Haruka dug in her back heels and hugged low to 
the ground in the desperate attempt to remain grounded, but she was slipping. There was 
another clash of swords and backlash of wind. Haruka tensed as the wave drew near but 
suddenly there was another body beside 
her.</p><p>“Haruka!”</p><p><i>Michiru?!</i></p><p>When the wind died down she weakly lifted 
her head and found her partner’s expression full of concern. “Haruka, are you all right? Ah, 
your hand!”</p><p>“I’m fine!” She shook her head when Michiru attempted to heal her. “No, 
don’t bother. It’s not going to work.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Long story short, as long we 
we’re trapped here we won’t be able to heal ourselves.” She met her eyes. “If I were able to 
heal myself, don’t you think I would have already done it by now?”</p><p>“But then--!!” 
Realizing what Haruka had just said, Michiru’s eyes were drawn to the fighting pair 
nearby.</p><p><i>Rei!</i></p><p>“Wait!” Haruka quickly grabbed her arm, and received an 
incredulous look in response.</p><p>“Why are you trying to stop me?” Michiru was confused 
but more so because of the seriousness in Haruka’s eyes.</p><p>“...Don’t help her.” As 
Haruka said this, she let go of Michiru’s arm and staggered back onto her feet. “I’ve been 
wondering about this for awhile now...About why it had to be this way. But now, I think I 
finally understand.”</p><p>Michiru blinked back. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>“Out of 
all of the Gods and Goddesses, why do you think Apollo took control of Ares?”</p><p>In the 
center of the battlefield, Rei summoned up red flames around her sword and stabbed at the 
God. Apollo attempted to yank away from the attack, but he wasn’t fast enough and ended up 
being speared through the left shoulder.</p><p><i><b>STAB</b></i></p><p>“GaHHH!” His 
shoulder guard was instantly swallowed up by the flames. The man in turn swung back with the 
motion and whirled on Rei. Rei met the blow with a backhanded glance and knocked his arm 
away as she brought her blade down again. This time her strike drew a long slash down the 
front of his armor. The metal cracked where the blade had gouged but it had not penetrated 
deep enough to completely break through. Rei muttered an angry curse under her breath before 
she relentlessly pursued her retreating opponent.</p><p><i><b>Ting! Ting! 
</b></i></p><p><i><b>Slash—Tinz! </b></i></p><p><i><b>Slash—slash----ting! 
CRACKLE!!</b></i></p><p>“Don’t you see?” Haruka continued on. “He didn’t control Ares 
because of his bloodlust. He did it because Ares was the only one other than his sister who 
was a threat to him!”</p><p>Apollo and Rei’s blades met again, releasing another wave of 
sharp energy.</p><p>“But it’s not just that. If we jump in now, we’ll only be getting in the 
way. There’s no guarantee that we’ll be able to hit Apollo without hitting Rei in the 
recoil.”</p><p>Both fighters were at a deadlock now. They were so close now that Rei could 
clearly see the insanity in the God’s glowing silver eyes. As Rei pushed her weight against 
her blade, in the back of her mind she couldn’t help but feel uneasy about this predicament. 
Her opponent had already died once. He possessed no heartbeat, yet he had somehow managed to 
materialize and was here fighting her at this instant. Could she possibly defeat someone 
that was already dead?</p><p>A chill flew down her spine when Apollo suddenly reached out 
and grabbed her sword with his gloved hand. It was only for a brief second, but as the armor 
around his arm shattered Apollo slid his hand up against the blade and discharged the 
enveloping energy back into her eyes. Rei yelped and stumbled back in surprise.</p><p>“Rei!” 
Minako ran in from the side.</p><p>“Minako, don’t!”</p><p>The Venusian threw herself between 
the combatants as Apollo closed the distance. There was no time to think. Minako 
re-materialized her chains again and sent one directly at the God. Apollo instinctively 
countered and broke it with a single swing of his blade but the second chain caught him off 
guard and wrapped about one of his feet. His eyes briefly before he was forcefully pulled to 
the ground and was dragged backwards for a few seconds before he finally gripped onto the 
chain and shattered it with his bare hand.</p><p>Minako’s heart skipped a beat as he went to 
retrieve his sword. “Venus…Love-Me Chain!” She knocked his blade further away, prompting an 
enraged roar. However it appeared that the sword wasn’t quite so essential because he then 
went straight for her without it.</p><p>“Minako!”</p><p>“Mina?” Rei muttered in confusion 
from behind her. Her eyes were still bloodshot but her sight was slowly starting to return. 
She could distinctively make out someone standing in front of her now.</p><p>Minako summoned 
up her energy again as Apollo’s arm came down, but his fist was interrupted by another. At 
the last second Rei’s armoured leg flew up and took the blunt of the attack. Metal plates 
went flying everywhere but she didn’t stop in her advance. Apollo stumbled back in surprise 
when the Martian blindly lunged forward and tackled him straight into Ami and Makoto’s 
waiting attacks.</p><p>“Sparking…Wide Pressure!”</p><p>“Shine…Aqua 
Illusion!”</p><p><b>Sssssss----KABLAM!</b></p><p><b>KABLAM!</b></p><p>The God’s armor 
cracked again.</p><p>“Keep at it!” Haruka shouted. She stood up and pulled off her remaining 
glove with her teeth while Michiru had gone on ahead.</p><p>“Deep… 
SUBMERGE!”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiii</b><b>---KABLAM!!!!</b></p><p><i>We’re almost there! 
</i>Haruka wrapped the glove around her injured hand and picked up her sword again. She then 
sunk into an offensive position and waited for her opportunity. The moment Ami’s gun shots 
distracted him, she saw it.</p><p><b>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! 
Bam!</b></p><p>“HaaaaAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!”</p><p>As the others struggled to take the God down, 
Minako was shaking Rei in a state of panic. After Rei had recklessly attacked the Sun God 
she collapsed to the ground and hadn’t moved since.</p><p>“Rei! Rei, speak to me!”</p><p>The 
Martian finally groaned and winced when her mind registered the pain in her leg. “Ouch, 
would you stop that already? I’m fine--”</p><p><i><b>Slap!</b></i></p><p>Rei was stunned. 
She slowly turned her head to look at the other woman and saw angry tears in Minako’s 
eyes.</p><p>“You’re fine?! Is that all you have to say for yourself?! When you suddenly 
disappeared, I...” Her words trailed off before she could finish. From her expression it 
looked as though there was more she wanted to say, but Minako bit her tongue.</p><p>“Mina, 
I--”</p><p>“There’s a lot more that I have to say to you.” She cut her off with a shaky 
voice. “But right now, there’s a fight that we have to finish. So, until it’s over, don’t do 
anything stupid and get yourself killed.”</p><p>With that Minako wiped away her tears and 
went to join the group. Rei touched her cheek in silence for a moment. It stung but somehow 
it didn’t hurt as much as she thought it would. Remembering their time on Uranus, it almost 
brought a smile to her lips.</p><p>“Heh. Same goes for you.” Rei stood up and transformed 
again. “Mars Planet Power, Make-Up!”</p><p><b>FWOOOOOOOOSH!</b></p><p><i>Let’s end 
this.</i></p><p>As the light faded away, she drew back her hand and a red bow and arrow 
materialized. On top of that, she summoned up blood magic and funnelled its power into the 
shot. As the two powers exponentially began to accumulate, her comrades on the battlefield 
ran for cover.</p><p>“Get back!”</p><p><b>Bam! Bam! Bam!</b></p><p>Makoto, Minako and Haruka 
had successfully retreated, but Ami was finding it very difficult to make distance. The Sun 
God was focusing on her. He had sensed the danger nearby and wasn’t about to let her go. 
Ami’s shots continued to hit him dead on, to the point of severing his chest plate, but it 
wasn’t enough. He was still coming at her.</p><p><b>Bam! Bam! Bam! Click. 
Click—click.</b></p><p><i>Oh no! I’m out! </i>Ami discarded the gun and tried to summon up 
her powers, but it wasn’t fast enough. Apollo lunged and she screamed.</p><p>“Oh no, you 
don’t!” Minako had reverted back to her normal form and lashed out at him with her brother’s 
sword.</p><p><i><b>Slash!</b></i></p><p>Apollo calmly leapt back, allowing the Goddesses to 
try and push him back. Over his shoulder, Minako could see that Rei had finished powering up 
and was ready to pull back herself when the God abruptly grabbed at her blade. “Huh?” The 
words barely left her lips when Minako was yanked forward so fast that she couldn’t tell up 
from down when he suddenly came down on her with both fists.</p><p>“GAH!” He hit her 
squarely in the back, knocking her straight to the ground. She couldn’t see it, but she 
immediately knew that her backside armor had been smashed in. A surge of panic flashed 
through her as the God was about to come down again.</p><p>“Minako!”</p><p>The Venusian 
squeezed her eyes shut, only to have them shoot open again when she heard someone else cry 
out. There was a struggle happening above her.</p><p>“AAH!!”</p><p>“MICHIRU!”</p><p>Everyone 
froze when Apollo grabbed Michiru and swung her in front of him, effectively putting her 
between him and the Martian. Rei hesitated. Behind the man, Minako glanced at her sword. She 
had barely reached out for it when a warning shot narrowly missed her head and thoroughly 
startled the Venusian. The air around the God was sparking dangerously; she was effectively 
stuck as well.</p><p>“Michiru!!!” Haruka shouted from the side.</p><p>“D-Don’t come any 
closer!” She warned them.</p><p>Rei felt her hands tremble. Her arrow had been aimed at 
Apollo’s head, but if she released the arrow now then Michiru would also be killed in the 
attack. As if almost looking for the answer, her eyes met Michiru’s and felt her heart skip 
a beat.</p><p>“Rei! Shoot it!” Michiru continued to struggle, yet not as much as before. 
Judging by the grip on her neck, she knew that the God could snap it at any 
second.</p><p><i>I...</i>Rei narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?! This is 
your chance!”</p><p>Despite her plea, Rei’s heart was still wracked with indecision. She 
<i>had </i>disliked Michiru, but never enough to want to kill her. Even as she hesitated, 
she could feel her friends’ intense gazes all rest on her. Haruka’s especially.</p><p>Haruka 
briefly met Michiru’s eyes and saw the determination in them. For a moment there seemed to 
be a silent exchange between the two women. Without a word, Haruka suddenly broke the gaze 
and then shot Rei a serious one.</p><p>“Haruka...?”</p><p>“<i>Do it.”</i></p><p>“What?!” The 
rest of her friends were just as shocked as Rei was.</p><p><i>Is she just going to let her 
partner die? </i>From where Minako was sitting she could see that this was beginning to 
become too much for Rei. If it were anybody else in her position, she was sure they would 
have already buckled underneath the pressure. Well, perhaps not for one person. It was then 
that it occurred to her:</p><p><i>Where’s Setsuna when we need her? Wait a minute. Where is 
Setsuna?!</i></p><p>Rei was trying to keep her breathing and shoulders relaxed when she 
heard a faint voice in her head saying,</p><p>“<b>Shoot it.”</b></p><p><i>But I can’t! I’ll 
kill her! </i></p><p>“<b>Trust me.” </b></p><p>Rei paused. There was something oddly 
familiar about that reassuring tone.</p><p><i>That voice. Is that you, Setsuna?</i></p><p>At 
that exact moment, the woman stepped out of the shadows from behind the 
Martian.</p><p>“Setsuna?!” Haruka cried out in shock. <i>Am I seeing things?! </i>“But I 
thought you were--”</p><p>Apollo instinctively tensed as her presence was unmasked. His 
silver eyes flashed, and then widened in recognition and something else as her face came 
into the light. A name was slowly being pieced together in his mind.</p><p><i>...Set...suna. 
</i>His gripped on Michiru automatically slackened.</p><p>“Now!” Setsuna 
commanded.</p><p>“Here...it comes!” There was a roar in Rei’s ears as she released the arrow 
and watched it fly towards the pair.</p><p>Michiru’s eyes narrowed in anticipation. The 
moment it had been fired, she tightened her grip on the man’s hands and pulled her weight to 
the side. The arrow flew past her side and pierced the middle of Apollo’s chest. Apollo 
gagged as the attack registered, but he didn’t have a chance to recover; behind him, Minako 
grabbed at her sword and plunged it into his back from behind. There was a moment of tension 
between the parties as the sword was slowly removed and the Sun God slumped to the 
ground.</p><p>“Is--Is that it?” Ami dared to ask.</p><p>“Did we get him?” Makoto whispered 
beside her.</p><p>“Michiru! Setsuna!” It looked like Haruka couldn’t decide who to run to 
first.</p><p>“I am all right.” Setsuna nodded.</p><p>“The same goes for me.” Michiru 
panted.</p><p>“But how? I...” Both women watched as Haruka debated with herself whether or 
not to believe them. She was angry, but she was about to become angrier; their reunion was 
interrupted when Apollo’s body abruptly burst into flames and converged into a single one 
overhead. The next thing that they heard was a mocking laughter that boomed throughout the 
air around them.</p><p>“I’m really starting to hate that laugh.” Haruka growled under her 
breath.</p><p>“<b>AHAHAHAHAHA!!!! That was pretty good! But now, it’s over.”</b></p><p>“What 
did you say?!”</p><p>“He’s referring to his real body.” Setsuna said calmly.</p><p>“What?! 
You mean, that wasn’t him?!” Haruka shot back. This time the woman offered no 
explanation.</p><p>“<b>That’s right! What you fought was merely a piece of me. But what does 
it matter now? As we speak, my trump card is coming right to me! You will all meet your end 
soon enough!”</b></p><p>“No...Is he talking about Hotaru?!”</p><p>Everyone suddenly 
remembered the girl they had been chasing. The thought of Apollo getting his grubby hands on 
Hotaru again was making Haruka’s blood boil.</p><p>“Grr...Okay, we’ll talk later. C’mon! We 
have to go after him!”</p><p>The others nodded. “Right!”</p><p>Setsuna lifted her staff and 
the crimson light engulfed the area once again.</p><p><u>(Hotaru)</u></p><p>While the others 
had been fighting, Hotaru had been steadily tracking her way through the dimension. It had 
taken her awhile to hunt down her opponent’s spiritual trail, but all of her hard work was 
starting to pay off; his presence was becoming stronger and more pronounced by the 
second.</p><p>Up ahead she broke through another wall in the space and exited into a large 
room. For a moment she scanned the area. There was an elevated platform that was encased by 
a circle of pillars to her right. She instantly recognized the image from one of Setsuna’s 
visions.</p><p><i>This is it. He’s here. </i>Hotaru narrowed her eyes and silently 
materialized her silence glaive. <i>Usagi, please be all right.</i></p><p>As Hotaru 
cautiously approached the structure she felt her stomach begin to knot up as she sighted the 
orange light shining past the pillars. It tickled something within her memory, but for the 
sake of her loved one she ignored the uneasy feeling. Hotaru continued to creep forward 
until she finally reached one of the columns and ducked close to it. Then, slowly, she 
peeked around it. The light was bright, nearly blindly her, but up ahead there was a dark 
shadow lying close to the ground. She blinked. When her eyes adjusted she felt her heart 
skip a beat.</p><p>Without thinking she rushed out to the woman’s side and began to shake 
her. “Usagi?!” <i>Oh no...</i> “Usagi! If you can hear me, say something!”</p><p>When she 
heard her sister moan she silently breathed a sigh of relief. <i>Thank Goddess...She’s 
alright.</i></p><p>“<b>So...You’ve finally come.”</b></p><p>Hotaru turned her head and came 
face to face with a large spiritual mass of hovering orange energy. Although his appearance 
had changed since she last saw him, she knew the presence instantly.</p><p>“Apollo.” She 
shot him a look of disdain. The former God chuckled in response.</p><p>“<b>I’ve been waiting 
for you. Have you finally decided to come home?”</b></p><p>Hotaru winced when a loud buzzing 
in her head started.</p><p>“Hotaru? What’s wrong?” Usagi reached up and placed a hand 
against her pale cheek. Instantly, upon contact, there was a flash of light before her eyes. 
Usagi was forced to pull her hand back, but for a moment she had sensed a foreign signature 
buried deep within her sister’s mind.</p><p><i>There’s something there.</i></p><p>Hotaru 
grunted and beat down the tingling sensation until the noise dimmed. “Usagi,” she hissed 
out. “Whatever happens, stay here, all right? I’ll...protect you.”</p><p>“No, wait! You’re 
not well!”</p><p>Apollo was amused when the ‘child’ stood up and dared to raise her blade 
against him. It looked as though she were serious this time.</p><p>“<b>You would dare to 
raise your blade against a blood-relative? That’s too bad...And here I went through all the 
trouble of bringing you a...present.”</b></p><p>Both siblings tensed when a cloud of black 
particles materialized a few meters in front of them. But they were more shocked when they 
realized that the figure standing before them was Nozomi. The girl looked ragged. She stared 
at the floor with empty, glowing red eyes, as if she were already dead.</p><p>“Nozomi!” 
Usagi gasped.</p><p>Hotaru was taken aback, but she was more angry than surprised. “What 
have you done to her?!”</p><p>“<b>Haven’t I always told you, my dear niece? Worry about 
yourself first.”</b></p><p>“Let her go!”</p><p>“<b>Ah, I wouldn’t do that if I were you. You 
see with one, single thought, I can end her pitiful life. If you are so concerned about the 
girl then you will abide by my commands. However, if you are that desperate to get to me, 
then you could always do the deed yourself. After all, what’s one more life compared to the 
countless of lives you’ve already taken?”</b></p><p>He saw Hotaru hesitate, but only for a 
second. He was mildly surprised when the girl suddenly began to step towards the girl, with 
her weapon still in her hands.</p><p>“Hotaru? No! You can’t be serious!” Usagi protested. 
She tried to scramble up onto her feet, but the dark look that Hotaru shot her made her 
freeze in her tracks.</p><p>“Do you recall what I told you earlier, Usagi?” Her sister asked 
her. “On the battlefield, sometimes, you will come across times when there will be things 
that you need to do...even if you do not wish to do them.”</p><p>“But she’s our friend! 
She’s still alive!”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“Huh?” Usagi was shocked.</p><p>“What he said was 
true. I have already killed many people, so what is one more life? If we do not stop him, 
millions more will be 
lost.”</p><p>“But...”</p><p><b>Tup...Tup...Tup.</b></p><p><i><b>Crak—kzz...</b></i></p><p>Hotaru 
stopped in front of the girl with dark energy crackling all around her. Nozomi’s eyes 
blankly stared back as the woman raised her hand.</p><p>“I’m sorry..but you’re in my way.” 
Hotaru pulled her hand back.</p><p>“Hotaru, N<i>OOOOOO</i>!!!” Usagi screamed.</p><p>Hotaru 
instead lashed out with her other hand and punched the girl in the head. Nozomi crumpled to 
the ground but in her place was the shadow assassin who had possessed her. The creature 
briefly blinked back in confusion and moved for its weapon but was cut down by Hotaru’s 
blade before it could defend 
itself.</p><p><i><b>SLASH!</b></i></p><p>“SKRRREE!!!”</p><p><b>Shroom!</b></p><p>Contrary to 
what Usagi had thought Nozomi soon stirred on the floor. The blonde had nearly broken down 
into tears as she rushed to the girl’s side. All the while, Hotaru had remained frozen to 
the spot. She watched her sibling pick the smaller girl up and held her close, protectively, 
but she said nothing. There was a dark and contemplative look in her 
dark-eyes.</p><p>“<b>Amusing...”</b></p><p>Her uncle finally said.</p><p>“<b>You rejected 
the darkness within her with your own. However, it was a foolish waste of time and energy. 
Regardless of your plans, you cannot put them into action as long as they are 
around.”</b></p><p>“Hotaru? What is he talking about?” Usagi asked her from 
behind.</p><p>“<b>She was going to sacrifice herself and take me down with her. A noble 
intention, don’t you agree?”</b></p><p>“So...it’s true. You really were going to kill 
yourself.”</p><p>“Usagi...”</p><p>“I don’t understand!” Her family was momentarily taken 
aback by the emotion in her voice. “Why do we have to fight each other? Why are you doing 
this?!”</p><p>Apollo was silent for a moment. In his eyes, he thought saw his sister instead 
of his niece.</p><p>“<b>You brought this upon yourselves. You all claimed to be my friends, 
my FAMILY! And then what do you do? You go off into your own little worlds and pretend that 
I don’t exist! You’re all happy because of the sacrifices I MADE! Why am I the only one who 
had to suffer?! And then...you all abandoned me. You betrayed me!! You bastards killed me 
and then continued on as if nothing had happened! Well, screw you! All of you...! You 
self-proclaimed rulers and your dogs...you can all go to 
HELL!!!!”</b></p><p><i><b>Sheeeeeeeen....</b></i></p><p>The mass of energy began to flare 
up. Apollo was readying his attack and Hotaru was preparing to counter it.</p><p><i>...You 
must really hate me... don’t you?</i> Usagi heard his voice within her head.</p><p>“No.” She 
shook her head. “I pity you.”</p><p>“<b>DISAPPEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!”</b></p><p>A beam of orange 
light charged towards the trio. Hotaru raised her glaive. “Silence 
Wall!!”</p><p><i><b>BLAM!!</b></i></p><p>A purple barrier came up as the beam struck it. The 
strain on her body was immediate. Hotaru dug her feet into the floor and pushed forward for 
support as more blasts followed. As each one connected with the barrier, Hotaru winced; even 
if she were in top condition the challenge would have been 
daunting.</p><p><i><b>BLAM!!</b></i></p><p><i><b>BLAM!!</b></i></p><p><i><b>BLAM!!</b></i></p><p>“Rrrg!!!” 
<i>T-This isn’t good! Now that he’s purely a spiritual being, he doesn’t have limits on his 
spiritual powers anymore! And as long as we’re in this dimension he’ll continue to draw 
power from it!</i></p><p><i><b>BLAM!!</b></i></p><p><i>...He was right. I had intended to 
sacrifice myself. However, if I attempt to do so now, both Usagi and Nozomi will be caught 
up in the blast.</i></p><p>As if knowing what she was thinking, Apollo added,</p><p>“<b>If 
you use that power, they will not be the only ones affected.”</b></p><p>“What?!” The buzzing 
in her head was growing louder.</p><p>“<b>Your ‘friends’ are somewhere in this dimension as 
well. Despite the barrier that you’ve put up, they somehow got in. A nuisance, but it’s 
served me well.”</b></p><p><i><b>CRACKLE—BLAAM!!!</b></i></p><p>Hotaru’s barrier finally 
gave in.</p><p>“Hotaru!”</p><p>Hotaru fell to the floor and coughed violently. The barrier 
outside, surrounding the city was still intact. Her body was reaching its 
limit.</p><p>“...Usagi... I’m sorry. I guess I’m just useless after all.” She was surprised 
when her sister hugged her tightly. <i>Usagi...?</i></p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Hotaru 
blinked. When Usagi pulled back, she saw a strange light in her sibling’s blue 
eyes.</p><p>“You protected me all this time, Hotaru. So now, it’s my turn to protect you.” 
She smiled. For a moment, it didn’t quite register in Hotaru’s mind what the blonde had 
said. She suddenly snapped out of her thoughts when Usagi suddenly stood up and stepped 
towards Apollo.</p><p>“No, what are you doing?! He’ll kill you!”</p><p>Usagi came to a stop 
a meter ahead of the pair and stared up at the glowing mass of energy. It was hot, and there 
was so much anger radiating from it. But despite that, in her mind it was still her 
uncle.</p><p><i>I only wish we could have met under different 
circumstances...</i></p><p>Hotaru held her breath when Usagi brought her hands out in front 
of her and a white crystal emerged from her chest.</p><p><i>Don’t tell me she’s going 
to...!</i> Her thoughts were cut off when Usagi’s white energy began to cascade throughout 
the area. Her heart crystal was powering up, and it was making Apollo uneasy; where their 
energies touched, there were sparks.</p><p>“Hey, Hotaru? Do you remember when you asked me 
why I said I would fight? The reason is... is because I want to protect the people that I 
love!”</p><p>Hotaru’s heart skipped a beat. “But that still won’t be enough! You’ll 
die!”</p><p>Usagi’s blue-eyes softened in understanding. “I still have to 
try...”</p><p>There was a flicker of orange light from 
above.</p><p>“<b>...Die...”</b></p><p>“USAGI!”</p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p><i><b>SHhhhRRKK!!!</b></i></p><p>“<b>What?!”</b></p><p>There 
was a flash of purple light in the distance. 
“Dead...Scream...”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrRrRrRRRRRR---Kablam!</b></i></p><p>“<b>GRAAGH!”</b></p><p>The 
God whirled his spiritual sight around. He knew that attack very well and he was looking for 
its owner. But instead, he found himself shrinking back in horror when the others appeared. 
They were walking between the pillars, but they were not alone. Each of the young women he 
had ruthlessly hunted was standing side by side with the spirits of their mentors—his former 
friends whom he had killed himself. Even Ares was there. The man’s dark eyes glared back at 
him from beside the young Goddess of Mars.</p><p>“So this is where you went, you coward!” 
Haruka shouted.</p><p>Their eyes, the expression on their faces, it was just like last 
time.</p><p>“<b>N-No...”</b> The flames of his body flickered.</p><p>There was a blast of 
purple light behind him and suddenly his being felt heavy. Setsuna had initiated a barrier 
on one half of the room. In front of him Hotaru dashed forward and initiated one for the 
other half.</p><p>“Silence Wall!”</p><p>Their barriers joined in the middle and trapped the 
former God’s spiritual form down.</p><p><i><b>FwooOOOOOOOOSH!!!</b></i></p><p>Apollo was 
beginning to panic. He couldn’t move. In a rush he began to blast at the combined barrier 
around him, but his attacks were hardly doing damage.</p><p>“<b>No! No! 
NO!”</b></p><p><b>BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!</b></p><p>“Do it now!” Setsuna shouted over the wind. 
“Channel your powers to Usagi!”</p><p>“Right!”</p><p>“<b>GRAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!” </b>Apollo 
shouted loudly as the lights began to light up all around him.</p><p><i>Here we 
go...!</i></p><p>“Mercury Planet Power!”</p><p>Mercury’s insignia lit up on Ami’s forehead 
as a blue light flew to the crystal in Usagi’s hands. Usagi’s eyes widened a little as the 
power joined together with hers.</p><p>“Jupiter Planet Power!”</p><p>“Uranus Planet 
Power!”</p><p>“Neptune Planet Power!”</p><p>“Venus Planet Power!”</p><p>“Mars... Planet 
Power!”</p><p><i><b>Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! 
Ping!<br>Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen---</b></i></p><p>“Moon... Prism Power!”</p><p>Their powers 
combined and exploded from the crystal as a white beam of light that charged at the Sun God. 
Both Hotaru and Setsuna simultaneously released the barrier seconds before 
impact.</p><p><i><b>FwooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOSH!!!</b></i></p><p>“NOOOOOO------<i>OOOOOOO</i>!!!!!!!!!!”</p><p><i><b>KAA---BLAAAAAAAAA—AAaAAAAAA---AaAaAAAM!!!!</b></i></p><p><u>(Sun 
Battlefield)</u></p><p>Outside the city, a white beam of light could be seen rising up from
