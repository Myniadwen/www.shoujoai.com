<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 2 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        Some people are almost born with the qualities that made one 
cool. Others develop it early, and never seem to go wrong. A few work 
at becoming cool, some achieving it and others not. And a few, a rare 
few, achieve coolness by accident, going on with their lives 
completely unaware that they&#39;ve become the idol of an entire school.

        &#39;Ami Mizuno,&#39; Haruka Tenoh thought with a smile, &#39;certainly 
fell into the last category.&#39; The sandy-blonde haired, boyishly tall 
young woman watched Ami from the safety of the crowd, trying to figure 
her out.

        It wasn&#39;t any one thing that made Ami cool. It wasn&#39;t the 
scar, though it was distinctive. It wasn&#39;t the clothes, in even darker 
colors than she had previously had worn. And it wasn&#39;t the attitude, 
though something had certainly changed in there as well. It was a 
combination of all those things and more that had given Ami the 
quality that people described as cool.

        Not wanting to be seen lurking about Haruka moved on with the 
crowd, listening with a smile to some of the whispered conversations 
that were going on all around her. The majority of them were all about 
Ami, her having graduated to this institute so early, her being in the 
top of her classes, and a fair number of comments about her overall 
cuteness.

        &quot;Hello, Haruka,&quot; the gentle voice came up beside her and 
continued, &quot;how is our young charge doing today?&quot; Michiru fell into 
step beside Haruka quite easily, the green haired girl smiling up at 
her taller lover happily.

        &quot;Doing just fine,&quot; Haruka answered dryly, &quot;and I&#39;m certain 
that she&#39;d resent knowing that we&#39;re keeping an eye on her.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Michiru admitted, &quot;but I do worry about her.&quot;

        &quot;You and Setsuna both do,&quot; Haruka nodded, her own eyes 
flickering with regret. A slight smile appeared on her face as she 
added, &quot;Too bad she just can&#39;t make up some excuse to get Ami down to 
the nurse&#39;s office.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not even going to suggest that to her,&quot; Michiru smiled. 
They walked on together a bit, &quot;What should we do now?&quot;

        &quot;Not sure,&quot; Haruka answered. She frowned, &quot;Ami looks like 
she&#39;s doing fine, but other than Chibi-Usa she&#39;s... alone.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s not much we can do about that,&quot; Michiru sighed 
softly, &quot;we&#39;ve taken the first steps. She just has to decide to 
respond.&quot;

        Ami Mizuno turned with a frown, having caught a flash of sandy 
blonde hair in the corner of her eye. &#39;I guess not,&#39; she thought 
before turning back to her route.

        &quot;Excuse me, Miss Mizuno?&quot; a man&#39;s voice asked.

        Ami looked the young man over, assessing him with a single 
glance. He was athletic, but there was a furtive look about him too, 
as if he had become very practiced at the art of deception. &quot;Yes?&quot; she 
asked the two men there simply.

        One of the teachers stood beside him, and Ami instantly 
recognized him as the coach of one of the school&#39;s athletic teams. &quot;I 
was wondering if you could help us out,&quot; the teacher said to her with 
an unrelenting sort of cheerfulness in his voice, &quot;You see, Mr. Takema 
here needs some tutoring, and I&#39;ve hear that...&quot;

        &quot;No.&quot; With that, Ami turned to walk away.

        &quot;Wait a moment,&quot; the teacher sounded surprised, &quot;I wasn&#39;t 
finished.&quot;

        Ami turned to give the teacher such a look that he stepped 
back from her involuntarily. &quot;Yes, you were. You don&#39;t want a tutor, 
you want someone who will do all of your star athlete&#39;s work for him. 
That is something that I will not do,&quot; she finished. She walked away, 
leaving the two stunned figures standing there behind her.

        The two men stood there in stunned shock until the soft sound 
of clapping could be heard, jerking them back to life. &quot;The fearsome 
Ami Mizuno strikes once again,&quot; Setsuna said with a certain amount of 
amusement.

        &quot;What do you mean, fearsome?&quot; the teacher managed weakly.

        &quot;Our Ms. Mizuno has developed quite the reputation,&quot; Setsuna 
said to him with honest admiration in her voice, &quot;as someone who even 
the teachers fear to cross.&quot; She looked thoughtfully at the boy he was 
escorting, &quot;She certainly had this situation pegged. Doesn&#39;t he have a 
make-up assignment due, one to save his grade?&quot;

        &quot;Yes he does,&quot; the teacher sighed. He looked over at Setsuna 
hopefully, &quot;You seem to understand her, could you appeal to her to 
help out Mr. Takema?&quot;

        Setsuna smiled sadly, &quot;I rather doubt that.&quot;

        The nurse&#39;s office was often quiet, and Setsuna&#39;s duties there 
were rarely taxing, giving her plenty of time to think. Too much time, 
she often had to admit. Lately, the problem of Ami Mizuno lay at the 
forefront of her thoughts.

        &#39;She&#39;s been hurt so terribly deeply,&#39; Setsuna thought, &#39;lost 
so very much.&#39;

        All their pain over the loss of the Princess had come to the 
surface when the Outers had first met Sailor Mercury, boiling up in 
angry words. Haruka had been biting, accusing Ami of failing in her 
duties, of being less of a Senshi than those who had fallen in battle. 
And Ami&#39;s anger had been directed at her, at Pluto&#39;s decision not to 
intervene to save Usagi and the others.

        Intellectually, Setsuna was certain that Ami fully understood 
all the complex reasons for her decision not to act. But reason hadn&#39;t 
been much at play on that day, and Ami had been as harsh as Haruka. 
Perhaps she was even more so because of her instinctive understanding 
of Setsuna&#39;s own powers over the timestream.

        &#39;And then there was the Grail,&#39; Setsuna thought glumly.

        Haruka and Michiru had chosen to keep Ami out of their plans, 
Haruka due to distrust, Michiru due to concern for the fragile young 
woman. Sailor Mercury and Chibi-Moon had walked into the chapel blind, 
not knowing what was happening but determined to help however they 
could, and in the end the Grail had fallen into Ami&#39;s hands.

        And quite unexpectedly the Grail awoke.

        It&#39;s power shouldn&#39;t have fully manifested itself for 
centuries, but in Sailor Mercury&#39;s hands the Grail sang. It 
obliterated the Witches Five, the Heart Snatchers, and their dark 
masters in a single wave of pure power, and Setsuna had been certain 
that Ami was going to use it to transform the entire Earth itself. But 
in a single act of supreme will power Ami drew all that power back, 
containing it once more within the Grail itself.

        &#39;She is the most powerful of the Senshi,&#39; Setsuna thought, 
&#39;which means that we Outers are going to have to learn to work with 
her. Somehow.&#39;

        Haruka and Michiru got home first, so Michiru usually started 
up dinner. She and Setsuna were the most domestic in the household, 
while Haruka was the least. Hotaru was willing to help, of course, but 
she had a lot to learn.

        Setsuna came last, and sighed happily as she came in and 
smelled dinner cooking. &quot;Michiru, will you marry me?&quot; she joked.

        &quot;I&#39;m taken, as you well know,&quot; Michiru laughed. She looked up 
at Setsuna thoughtfully, &quot;I wasn&#39;t aware that you swung that way.&quot;

        &quot;It wasn&#39;t that uncommon in the Moon Kingdom,&quot; Setsuna 
explained.

        &quot;Does that mean Michiru and I could have gotten married back 
then?&quot; Haruka asked her as she walked in from the garage, cleaning 
grease off of her hands.

        With a slight smile Setsuna said, &quot;I believe you were married, 
actually.&quot;

        Hotaru ran into the room with a smile, &quot;Is Chibi-Usa coming 
over again tonight?&quot;

        &quot;I think so,&quot; Michiru agreed.

        The small car pulled up outside, but something unusual 
happened. Watching as covertly as possible they saw Ami get out, going 
around to open Chibi-Usa&#39;s door. Taking the pink haired gir&#39;s hand in 
hers Ami proceeded to walk up the sidewalk to the front door.

        *Ding dong!* the doorbell rang.

        The three women looked at each other in surprise. Hotaru 
tugged on Setsuna&#39;s arm, so she walked to the door and opened it with 
a smile. Ami looked nervous, that made Setsuna feel a bit better, 
&quot;Hello, Ms. Mizuno. It&#39;s nice to see you again.&quot;

        &quot;Call me Ami,&quot; she smiled back. She hesitated, &quot;Chibi-Usa 
tells me that Hotaru mentioned that it might be nice if I visited 
sometime. I thought I&#39;d take you up on it.&quot;

        Setsuna stepped aside to let her in, &quot;We&#39;re glad to have you.&quot;
