<h1>No Time for Love (part 4 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/prince_kitten.html">Prince_Kitten</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/timeluv-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>A couple days after the fateful kidnapping, Kira poofed back into her 
lair. She&#39;d stayed with Ami and Rei for the first couple nights but she 
had to feed and had left them sleeping the night before. Now, refreshed, 
she tiptoed quietly into the bedroom Rei and Ami were sharing. She had 
put a single queen size bed in the room forcing them to share. They had 
slept on opposite sides of the bed the first night, but were slowly 
migrating toward the middle. With the air still brimming with desire and 
love, they didn&#39;t seem to mind waking up next to each other and Kira 
couldn&#39;t have been happier about it. She spread out a few more wisps 
hoping that they would anchor into the girls&#39; dreams and walked back to 
the living room. Noticing that the fire was low she added a few more 
logs to her brand new fireplace. Another condition Rei had demanded. She 
stared into it, allowing herself to zone as she stoked the logs and 
embers with the poker. Even now, she could remember seeing Setsuna for 
the first time. Beautiful green hair, gorgeous garnet eyes, body to die 
for. Kira shuddered remembering how she&#39;d felt the first time their eyes 
had met. She wanted the details fresh because Rei or Ami would ask soon. 
She knew they wanted to. But so far, they had been most concerned with 
contacting everyone. After planning for a while she had decided to video 
tape them saying they were all right and drop the videos off with one of 
the others. The biggest benefit was that it would be harder to track 
than a live broadcast. Not that she didn&#39;t put her own skills of coding 
above the senshi, she&#39;d just learned not to underestimate them. It would 
also put Ami and Rei at ease and that was her biggest concern. If they 
were happy and weren&#39;t worried about the others worrying about them, 
they&#39;d be that much more likely to succumb to the feelings she knew were 
already swirling around inside them. She&#39;d just finished gathering the 
last of the taping equipment after her meal last night and it was all 
set up, as soon as they were ready to do it.

Yawning a bit she stood and stretched wondering what to do until they 
got up. Deciding that her brain and her heart could only take so much 
reminiscing about Setsuna for so long, she was stuck between reading a 
book from her extensive library, playing video games on her also brand 
new TV set and playstation, or finding some other recreational activity 
to do. Reading was the first thing to go. She&#39;d read everything in her 
library hundreds of times anyway. The playstation went next. As fun as 
crashing cars into walls and spilling pixilated human blood all over the 
place was, she just wasn&#39;t in the mood. That left her pretty much where 
she&#39;d started. Turing around in place to survey her little abode, her 
eyes fell on the kitchen doors and an idea sprang to mind. *I&#39;ll make 
breakfast for them. Breakfast in bed.* Firmly believing that Rei and Ami 
had been way overworked and overstressed being the more sensible and 
responsible ones of their group, Kira was pretty sure that they would 
both enjoy a little leisure time. *And what could be more leisurely than 
breakfast in bed?*



In the other room Rei yawned and stretched as the sleep slowly faded 
from her eyes. Really slowly faded. Really, really slowly faded from her 
eyes. Sighing, she gave in to the call of the soft pillow and laid back 
down. Her body was putting out less effort now that it wasn&#39;t trying to 
sit up, and it was much easier to open her eyes. When they finally 
focused, it was a beautiful blue-haired woman that they focused on. 
Blinking rapidly at her own brain&#39;s description of Ami, Rei shook her 
head and focused again. Yep, still a blue-haired beauty. Giving in for 
the second time that day, despite the fact that she&#39;d been awake for 
less than five minutes, she admitted that yes, Ami was beautiful, and yes 
she knew it, and yes she&#39;d love to run herfingers through the soft 
tendrils, and yes she&#39;d like to pull the sleeping face closer, and 
yes.... 

That thought sent Rei shooting up to a sitting position so fast it made 
her head whimper. Ami didn&#39;t move though and Rei was quite glad that Ami 
could out-sleep Usagi.*Where in Kami-sama&#39;s name did that thought come 
from?*She wondered. Staring back at Ami&#39;s sleeping form she felt her 
brain give in again. *Oh, so it&#39;s going to be one of those days huh?* She 
laid down again and hesitantly reached out a hand. Pausing only briefly 
to wonder at her own boldness and slight insanity, her hand continued 
its journey until it reached the side of Ami&#39;s face. Rei let her fingers 
play with a few stray tendrils of blue hair before gently pushing it out 
of Ami&#39;s face. Surprised at how strong her desire to get closer was she 
paused for a minute, her hand resting with Ami&#39;s cheek in her palm. 
*Kira never did promise not to try anything. I wonder if she&#39;s got 
anything to do with this. I&#39;ve had a little crush on Ami for a while, 
but not like this.* Already admitting to her apparent weakness to say no 
to anything today, she scooted her head slightly closer and let her 
fingers brush Ami&#39;s soft skin tenderly. Her breathe caught in her throat 
as Ami&#39;s eyelids started to flutter open. Rei entertained the idea of 
backing up rapidly so Ami wouldn&#39;t catch her in this admittedly awkward 
position, but the little warning/responsibility voices in the back of 
her head had decided that this was a vacation day and Rei didn&#39;t move. 
Her eyes met Ami&#39;s beautiful blue ones and to Ami&#39;s credit, she didn&#39;t 
even seem to notice Rei&#39;s close proximity. 

&quot;Morning.&quot; She whispered. The extra pressure on her jaw alerted her to 
Rei&#39;s hand but her own voices hadn&#39;t woken up fully yet and Ami just 
smiled.

&quot;Morning.&quot; Rei whispered back. They were just laying there staring at 
each other when Ami found herself resisting the sudden urge to tease 
Rei. Having watched Usagi do it day after day she knew the possible 
consequences well, but decided that if she and Rei were on temporary 
vacation, she might as well have some fun. Switching from her soft wake 
up smile to a gentle teasing smirk she flicked her eye to where Rei&#39;s 
hand still rested on her cheek and then looked back at Rei with a 
quirked eyebrow.

&quot;So, exactly what did I interrupt by waking up?&quot; She asked teasingly. 
Momentarily the color drained from Rei&#39;s face and Ami realized that Rei 
actually had been planning on something. From their positions it wasn&#39;t 
hard for Ami to figure out what, but wanting to play and not get that 
serious quite yet, she widened her smile and Rei caught on to the fact 
that she was being teased.

&quot;I don&#39;t quite know what you mean Ami-chan. Care to go into details?&quot; 
Ami flushed. Rei had turned the tables on her extremely well and now she 
was caught between backing down, and intensifying the game they were 
playing. Deciding that backing down was not a very vacation-like thing 
to do, she grinned right back.

&quot;It just seems as though you&#39;re awfully close to me for just sleeping. 
And unless your hand fell on my cheek by accident, it&#39;s pretty clear 
that you were planning on doing something. What were you planning on 
doing Rei-chan? I mean, I was asleep so that does limit your possible 
options, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Ami kept her smile as she watched Rei falter. *Got 
her.*

Rei studied Ami&#39;s face closely searching for clues as to how far Ami 
wanted to push it. Feeling game and particularly daring, she threw the 
ball back into Ami&#39;s court, curious as to what Ami would do next.

&quot;And what if I had been planning on something?&quot; She dropped her voice 
slightly. &quot;Would it bother you?&quot; Ami&#39;s eyes widened slightly but she had 
clearly been challenged. Granted, the stakes were tremendously different 
from her normal challenges, but she found that following the possible 
game in herhead, she didn&#39;t really mind where it would likely end up. 

&quot;That depends.&quot; Rei quirked an eyebrow.

&quot;On what?&quot; Ami didn&#39;t normally win games like this and she found that 
this time, she was eager to win, or at least eager for Rei to call her. 
She dropped her voice to a sultry level she knew Rei didn&#39;t know she 
had. She&#39;d only discovered it recently, and quite by accident while 
visiting Haruka and Michiru. Haruka&#39;s favorite sport was teasing her and 
the last time she&#39;d been there, Ami had responded with a taunt of her 
own. Both Haruka and Michiru had exclaimed about her new voice and 
though she&#39;d left blushing, she&#39;d practiced it at home to perfection. Ami 
closed her eyes briefly. Calling upon her &#39;inner seductress&#39; as Haruka 
had deemed it, she opened her eyes and pinned Rei with a stare she knew 
was full of desire and promise. At the same time she tilted her head 
toward Rei and slid forward just a little bit so their lips were almost 
touching. 

&quot;On what you were planning to do.&quot; Rei&#39;s gulp was audible and inwardly 
Ami didn&#39;t know whether to cheer or be disappointed. Sure, it looked 
like she won, but she surprised herself in how badly she had wanted Rei 
to push it to the next level. 

For her part, Rei was stuck. Her hand was now almost behind Ami&#39;s head 
since Ami had moved closer. Ami was watching her with a look that sent 
fire through her veins and froze her at the same time. She was so close. 
Gradually Ami&#39;s seductive grin changed to one of victory and she started 
to pull away. It wasn&#39;t that Rei wanted to win the game, it really 
wasn&#39;t. She just wanted the prize. She tightened her arm and Ami stopped 
moving. The serious look in Rei&#39;s eyes gave way to a softer gaze and 
Ami&#39;s one of curiosity melted to slight apprehension. * Is Rei really 
gonna...* She got no further in her thoughts as Rei pulled her closer 
gently. Dropping all &#39;seductress&#39; facets Ami closed her eyes and let Rei 
lead. They didn&#39;t really have all that far to go thanks to Ami&#39;s teasing 
and Ami soon felt Rei&#39;s warm breath mingling with her own. Then she felt 
a feather-light pressure on her lips and reflexively licked her lips. 
She ended up lightly brushing Rei&#39;s lips with her tongue and they both 
shuddered from the feeling. A slight hesitation, and Rei closed the 
millimeter gap. Her lips pressed gently to Ami&#39;s and her body visibly 
tightened. Ami&#39;s lips were so soft and warm. It felt incredible. So good 
in fact that it took her a few moments to realize the intensity of the 
fire brewing in her belly. 

The kiss was a varitable explosion and Rei felt overwhelmed after a 
very short while. Ami was feeling much the same and had all but moaned 
when Rei&#39;s lips touched her own. The heat coming off the Priestess was 
just pouring into her body and she quickly found herself losing what 
little self-control she had left. Not wanting to get as serious as it 
was going to get so quickly, she pulled back gently. Rei pulled back too 
and for a minute they laid there, cheasts heaving. When their eyes met 
again they were both smiling gently and in an unspoken agreement, Rei 
pulled back, her hand coming to her side. Ami missed the warmth 
immediately, but knew that if they didn&#39;t cool off now, they weren&#39;t 
gonna stop and she wasn&#39;t quite ready for that step.

&quot;Well?&quot; Rei questioned and Ami looked at her curiously.

&quot;Well what?&quot; Rei giggled as she sat up and stared down at her. 

&quot;Did it bother you?&quot; Ami looked like a deer in the headlights and she 
looked at Rei with an expression of &#39; a little more help please?&#39;. &quot;You 
said whether or not what I had planned would bother you depended on what 
it was.That was what I had planned. So, did it bother you?&quot; Catching up 
in her brain Ami made a face in Rei&#39;s direction. Sliding her hand under 
her pillow she snorted and responded dryly, but with a smile.

&quot;Yes I minded, don&#39;t do it again.&quot; Rei faltered only until Ami&#39;s pillow 
came into contact with her head. Grinning playfully at her she threw the 
pillow back and they both broke out into soft giggles.

Outside the room, Kira stepped back from the door, still carefully 
balancing two trays of pancakes, juice, tea, and sausage. She was 
extremely glad that she had decided to peek in before just walking in 
with their breakfast. Otherwise she might&#39;ve interrupted their little 
moment.*How cute! I bet that was their first kiss. I should&#39;ve had a 
camera.* Looking back in she grinned at the sight of the playful pillow 
fight they were engaged in. * Things couldn&#39;t be much better. They may 
not be bonding as much with me, but I think that was definitely 
progress.* 

She cleared her throat to make her presence known and determined 
herself not to tease them too much about the whole thing. The last thing 
she wanted to do was scare them off. Pushing the door open with her back 
she walked into the room with the two full trays. Their surprise was 
evident.

&quot;What&#39;s all this?&quot; Rei asked, putting her pillow to the side.

&quot;Well what does it look like silly? It&#39;s breakfast. Soon to be 
breakfast in bed if you&#39;ll move those pillows and make a level spot.&quot; Ami 
moved them and Kira put the trays on the lap of each respective owner. 
She surveyed the strewn pillows and quirked a grin. &quot;And here I was 
worried that I&#39;d have to wake you up myself. You&#39;re having a good morning 
I take it?&quot; Ami and Rei both blushed and looked down a moment before 
nodding and Kira widened her smile. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re up. I have good 
news.&quot; Not even pausing in their acts of pouring syrup they looked at 
her questioningly. &quot;As soon as you guys are ready, you can contact your 
friends.&quot; Ami almost choked on her tea.

&quot;You&#39;re letting us go see them?&quot; Kira shook her head.

&quot;Uh-uh. Too risky, besides, we agreed to a couple of weeks right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, about that. You and I need to talk later.&quot; Kira raised her 
eyebrow at Rei who never ceased to amaze her. * Damn that girl has some 
big cajones.* 

&quot;Okay, whenever you want.&quot;

&quot;Um, if we aren&#39;t going to see them, how are we going to tell them 
we&#39;re all right?&quot; Ami asked quietly, cutting up a pancake.

&quot;Lights, camera, action girls. I&#39;m gonna video tape you. Then, I&#39;ll 
drop the video tapes off with them. Easy peasy.&quot;

&quot;How can we trust that you&#39;ll drop off the tapes?&quot; Again Kira sighed in 
Rei&#39;s direction. * Cajones of steel.* She decided before responding.

&quot;Well, if you want I&#39;ll carry a live-feed video camera and you can 
watch me as I drop them off. I&#39;ll even wear an ear piece so you can tell 
me where to go and such. Beyond that, you&#39;ll just have have to trust 
me.&quot;

&quot;Trust you?&quot; Kira made a face at Rei and then smiled.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna play that &#39;stronger, faster, and pretty much in charge&#39; card 
here.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot; Came the muffled response, the mouth being full of sausage at the 
moment.

&quot;She means we agree.&quot; Ami answered calmly, sipping more tea. Kira shook 
her head. *They agree huh? Well, I&#39;ll just have to get used to them 
being equals won&#39;t I?* 

&quot;Good. Then I&#39;ll leave you lovely young ladies to your breakfast, 
painstakingly made by yours truly thank you very much.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s wonderful. Thank you.&quot; Ami said, manners taking over, and Rei 
just nodded her agreement, the mouthful of food testament to her own 
thoughts.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome Ami-chan. Enjoy.&quot; She added before walking back out the 
door and leaving them to their meals. * Well, if I wasn&#39;t before, I&#39;m 
even more certain now that I made the right choice.*



Ami and Rei finished breakfast in relative silence. Ami couldn&#39;t get 
past the fact that she&#39;d just kissed someone. And it was a girl. And it 
was Rei. *Wow, did I really just kiss Rei? Me? The girl who gets rashes 
from love letters? I just kissed one of my best friends who wasn&#39;t 
Makoto in a bed, and liked it!? Oh my.* More confused than she wanted to 
admit because confusion was not something the girl genius was used to 
dealing with, Ami ate slowly trying to figure out why she&#39;d done it, and 
why it had felt so good. Rei was also feeling quite odd. * Ami is one of 
the few people I haven&#39;t had serious feelings about. So why did it feel 
so right to kiss her?*Rei knew that in all probability each of the 
senshi would end up doing something with all of the other senshi. Just 
being senshi made them close what with all the dying and adrenaline and 
such, but living for so long all together was sure to strengthen that 
bond even more. It was one of the strongest arguments Rei used with 
herself to keep up the hope. That eventually, if only for a little while, 
she would get to be with at least one of the people she loved. But Ami 
being her first? That was a shot out of the blue. Giggling at her own 
little pun, Rei chewed her meal. Breakfast went by fast for them simply 
because both were too absorbed in their own thoughts to realize that 
they were still eating. Once done they looked over at each other unsure 
of what to say. Ami grinned.

&quot;I wonder why we&#39;re so shy about all this?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. But we really don&#39;t have any reason to be.&quot; Rei answered 
with a grin of her own.

&quot;I think I actually feel a little guilty.&quot;

&quot;Guilty?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I mean, I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve loved Mako-chan for so long, it feels weird 
that I enjoyed getting a kiss from someone else.&quot;

&quot;Ha! I knew you enjoyed it!&quot; Ami flushed as Rei laughed and poked at 
herside. &quot;But seriously, I know how you feel. It&#39;s odd finally feeling 
good after feeling alone for so long.&quot;

&quot;Maybe there really is something to what Kira-san has been saying.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, maybe. And speaking of I guess we&#39;d best be getting up. We need 
to prepare for our close-ups.&quot; Ami giggled at Rei&#39;s impromptu posing.

&quot;Then I want to talk to her, about Setsuna-san.&quot;

&quot;Really Ami-chan! Prodding into other people&#39;s lives? I never.&quot; Ami 
stuck her tongue out at Rei&#39;s self-righteousness knowing that Rei had 
gone on way more &#39;recon&#39; missions than she had.

&quot;Tell me you&#39;re not curious about everything.&quot;

&quot;Oh definitely. If you weren&#39;t going to ask soon I would&#39;ve.&quot;

&quot;Well then, let&#39;s get going.&quot; Ami carefully slid out of bed, careful 
not to knock the breakfast tray over and started going through her 
closet. Kira must have been watching them for a while before she&#39;d made 
her move because the closet was full of clothes in Ami&#39;s size. And 
surprisingly, they were all comfortable clothes that Ami didn&#39;t mind 
wearing. Maybe they were all a little on the revealing side, but not to 
the point where Ami was embarrassed to wear them. Rei also had a closet 
full of clothes in her size and style and was already pulling shirt over 
her head. Hurriedly Ami followed suit. After dressing, brushing their 
teeth and doing all of their other morning activities they grabbed their 
trays and headed out into the main living room where Kira was stoking 
the fire.

&quot;Hey. I was starting to wonder if you guys had fallen back asleep or 
something.&quot; She teased and Ami resisted the urge to stick her tongue 
out. Rei however didn&#39;t seem to mind being childish and in true Rei form 
blew a raspberry in the vampire&#39;s direction before disappearing into the 
kitchen with the trays. Ami giggled at the slightly incredulous look 
Kira had on her face as she sat on the sofa. &quot;You know, I suppose I 
should be glad you two have a sense of humor huh? Otherwise this whole 
thing could have gone very badly.&quot;

&quot;It still could. Rei-chan and I haven&#39;t decided to stay forever. And as 
much as we&#39;re going to enjoy this &#39;vacation&#39;, we probably won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Ami sighed and folded her hands in her lap. 

&quot;No matter how much pain we may end up feeling because of the people 
we&#39;re around, I don&#39;t think either one of us could ever leave 
Usagi-chan. She&#39;s our princess. We were born to protect her. I for one 
could never leave her forever, even if it does mean living my life alone 
and hurt.&quot;

&quot;The same goes for me.&quot; Kira looked over at Rei who walked into the 
roomand sat next to Ami. &quot;I&#39;ve already died twice for Usagi-chan. I 
could never leave her forever.&quot;

&#147;But you&#39;re both still here.&quot;

&quot;I said I couldn&#39;t leave her forever. Don&#39;t get me wrong. A vacation 
from that meatball-head and all of life&#39;s wonderful little duties will 
hit the spot.&quot; Kira shook her head and gave a half smile. 

&quot;I don&#39;t get it. Just what&#39;s so great about her? I was watching for 
quite a while and I still don&#39;t get it. I mean, yeah she&#39;s a nice person 
but worth giving up your lives for?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t love her so you couldn&#39;t know how we feel. In fact, you hate 
her right?&quot; Kira sighed and stretched out resting her head on the edge 
of the couch. 

&quot;No, I don&#39;t hate her. I don&#39;t have any reason too. I mean, I suppose I 
could blame everything that happened on her. It was her stupid fault for 
killing herself and starting the final battle with the Negaverse. But 
no. It&#39;s her mother I&#39;m not all together fond of. It was her stupid 
rule....&quot; Kira trailed off and blinked back the tears that always 
threatened to spill out whenever she thought of what had happened.

&quot;Kira-san?&quot; Ami asked a bit hesitantly.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Kira responded, still staring into the fire.

&quot;The rule... I mean... what... I mean... ah...&quot; Ami looked over at Rei 
for help.

&quot;What rule were you talking about Kira-san? What happened between you 
and Setsuna-san?&quot; Kira sighed heavily and stared harder into the fire. * 
What happened between me and Setsuna? * After a bit a silence Kira 
cleared her throat. 

&quot;Well, I suppose I should start at the beginning. A little over a 
thousand years ago, I was bitten and turned into a vampire. By who 
exactly I couldn&#39;t tell you. But I do know that he is dead now. Anyway, 
the person who turned me had turned a few other people and we all used 
to hang out together. After our families died that little social circle 
was all we all had. In vampire terms we were pretty young so at first we 
stuck close together. After a time some of us left and a few of us were 
killed. Akio-san was the one who stayed with me. In our group we were 
the oldest and for a couple hundred years it was just the two of us and 
whoever we&#39;d gotten to play. But for whatever reason I started to lose 
interest with his bloodthirst. &quot;

****** &quot;Kira-chan! Where are you going off too? Aren&#39;t these beautiful 
ladies here enough for you?&quot; Kira looked over in at the said women. One 
was in Akio&#39;s arms. She was already half-dead. He&#39;d have to stop 
soon to avoid killing her. The other was was hidden under the blankets. 
Her head was much further down. &quot; This one here doesn&#39;t have much left 
in her, but you can play with the other one once she&#39;s done with me that 
is.&quot; Kira wrinkled her nose. 

&quot; No, I feel like going out for a bit.&quot; 

&quot; Oh, so you want one all to yourself? Well, enjoy your night. If you&#39;re 
not feeling all territorial, bring me back what&#39;s left. I&#39;m feeling 
particularly hungry tonight.&quot; With a growl he returned to the woman in 
front of him and Kira slipped out the door. ******

&quot;It had been like that for a while and I got tired of it. I started 
hanging out at bars and clubs and pulling further away from Akio. But 
then one night I met her. I was just sitting at a table and this 
beautiful woman walked in. She looked kinda lost and I saw my chance.&quot; 
Kira couldn&#39;t help but smile at the memory.

******	&quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot; Kira whispered into Setsuna&#39;s ear. 
She jumped and turned around. As soon as she had she relaxed and smiled. 

&quot;Setsuna.&quot; 

&quot;Well Setsuna-san, would you do me the honor of being my dance partner?&quot; 
In response the green-haired woman only took the offered hand. ****** 

&quot;I tell you what. It was that night that made me believe in love at 
first sight. At first we would just meet there but after a while we 
started making dates. I didn&#39;t tell her I was a vampire. For the first 
time since I&#39;d been turned I felt real love. Not just another 
one-nighter like I was used to. Plus, I thought she was human and I 
didn&#39;t want to scare her.&quot; Ami grinned at the thought of Setsuna being 
scared and Rei seconded it with a small giggle.&quot; About 8 or so months 
after we met she walked in on me drinking from one of the regulars at 
the bar. I was so nervous but she sorta took it in stride. Things 
settled down and I thought we were both happy. But only a few months 
after that, about the time that the battles with the Negaverse and the 
senshi were getting serious, Setsuna-...san came to one of our dates 
just bawling. She said...&quot; Kira closed her eyes briefly and swallowed 
hard. &quot;She said that she didn&#39;t think we could be together anymore. She 
said that she couldn&#39;t handle being with me knowing that she&#39;d spend her 
life with me and grow old but I would stay the same age and live for 
hundreds of years after her. She just said &#39; I&#39;m sorry&#39; and left me. I 
mean, the only person I had known for more than a day or so for the past 
two hundred years had been Akio and here we were going on a year. I 
couldn&#39;t believe that it was over. I went to that bar every night until 
it was destroyed during the fall of the Kingdom. I would&#39;ve given 
anything to be human again. To be with her again.&quot; Kira wiped the tears 
away from her eyes. 

&quot;Even now, a thousand years later, I hadn&#39;t gotten over her. I moved 
into this place, I broke almost all contact with Akio, I don&#39;t even talk 
to other vampires. There wasn&#39;t a day that went by that I didn&#39;t think 
about her. And then I meet all of you and find out the truth. That I&#39;ve 
been kicking myself this whole time about being a vampire and the only 
reason she really left me was because of that stupid Queen of hers and 
that damned law!&quot; Kira growled into the fire and Ami scooted a bit away 
from her.

&quot;What law?&quot; Rei asked. Broken from her hateful haze Kira blinked in 
confusion.

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;What damned law?&quot; Kira cocked her head to the side.

&quot;You mean you don&#39;t actually know? I suppose it hasn&#39;t become and issue 
for you guys yet but it probably will.&quot; Only barely managing to keep the 
hatred out of her voice Kira continued. &quot;The senshi all had a set of 
laws that they were supposed to follow. One of the ones near the top of 
the list was that no senshi could &#39;be&#39; with a demon. It was strictly 
enforced.&quot; Ami and Rei looked at each other and sat in silence for a 
while. They gave Kira achance to cool down a bit. 

&quot;How do you know all of that? About how Usagi-chan died and about the 
law?&quot; Kira stretched out her legs and then crossed them.

&quot;Like I said before most of the people I knew at the time hated the 
Queen and her senshi. In fact, the only reason we were allowed to live 
is because she felt sorry for us. Not all of us had chosen to be turned 
so she couldn&#39;t kill us in good conscience. Even so there were rules we 
had to follow as well. We couldn&#39;t kill anyone. We couldn&#39;t take from 
anyone who hadn&#39;t offered. No kids and that sort of thing. So, 
naturally, a lot of the power-hungry demons like Akio hated her and her 
enforcers for keeping us like that. They thought that it should have 
been us ruling and that it wasn&#39;t right for her to check our power like 
that. So in true &#39; know thy enemy&#39; form we all knew every thing we could 
about Kingdom life.&quot; Another long bout of almost completely comfortable 
silence passed and it was Ami who broke it this time. 

&quot;And then by complete coincidence, you pick two of her reincarnated 
friends to abduct?&quot; Kira looked over at Ami with a raised eyebrow and 
then started to laugh. Satisfied that the fire would not die she 
abandoned poking at it and sat back on the couch next to Ami.

&quot;I guess so. This was all just a complete coincidence. What rotten 
luck.&quot; Rei offered a half-smile.

&quot;Why does it have to be bad luck? Maybe you and Setsuna-san could work 
out better this time around...&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Kira interrupted. &quot;No, that could never happen. She... she left 
me for a reason and that reason hasn&#39;t changed. I&#39;m still a demon, and 
she&#39;s still a senshi.&quot; Kira was silent for a moment and then gave a 
small laugh. &quot;You&#39;d think that a thousand years later that would have 
finally sunk in. Oh well.&quot; She stared up at the ceiling for a bit then 
back over at Ami and Rei who were watching her. &quot;Was that all the 
questions you had?&quot; 

&quot;About that subject. But I have something else I&#39;d like to talk to you 
about.&quot; Rei said and Kira quirked a smile in her direction.&quot;

&quot;So you said earlier. What is it?&quot; Rei took a deep breath and tried her 
best not to look at Ami. 

&quot;You never did promise not to try anything as far as..uh..seduction 
goes. Have you done something to us in that respect?&quot; Kira&#39;s jaw nearly 
dropped and Ami was doing her best to look everywhere else. Not one to be 
outdone so easily, Kira played it cool.

&quot;Done something to you? Like what?&quot; Rei&#39;s eyes widened but to her 
creditshe composed herself enough to answer.

&quot;You know, something to uh, heighten our levels of ...&quot; Rei coughed out 
the last word and though Kira had understood perfectly, she decided to 
move in for the kill. Purposefully leaning across Ami so she was close to 
Rei she put on an innocent smile, but not so innocent that Rei wouldn&#39;t 
know she was being teased.

&quot;Heighten your levels of what? I didn&#39;t quite catch that last part.&quot; 
Rei glared at her but swallowed hard.

&quot;Desire.&quot; She said quietly but Kira only offered a confused look.

&quot;What? You&#39;ll have to speak up. Hearing goes first in old age you 
know.&quot;Flushing but unwilling to back down now Rei glared even harder and 
practically shouted in an embarrassed rage.

&quot;Desire! Heighten our desire!&quot; Kira smirked but quickly replaced it 
withan innocent look and leaned back into her side of the couch.

&quot;Heighten your levels of desire? Why would you think that?&quot; Teasingly 
she leaned close to Ami as though whispering a secret.&quot; Are you two 
feeling more... desireful than normal?&quot; She whispered and gently placed 
a hand on the end of Ami&#39;s knee. &quot;Are you sure I&#39;m the one who&#39;s doing 
that?&quot; She teased and leaned even closer. She spoke to Ami but focused 
her eyes on Rei. The priestess just gulped.

&quot;I&#39;m, pretty sure you have a hand in it yes.&quot; Kira almost giggled at 
the choice of words and slid her hand a little higher on Ami&#39;s leg. Ami 
swallowed and closed her eyes, whimpering slightly. Kira had managed to 
turn her so she was facing Rei and Kira was speaking almost into her 
ear. Kira&#39;s breath on her cheek was doing incredible things to her lower 
region and the hand on her thigh wasn&#39;t helping. The knowledge that Rei 
was not even a foot away watching was... turning her on a lot more than 
she&#39;d expected. Kira grinned at Rei as the girl&#39;s eyes flicked down to 
Kira&#39;s hand then quickly back up again.

&quot;Well, I might&#39;ve... had a hand in it. Is it a bad thing? Does feeling 
desire bother you?&quot; She whispered into Ami&#39;s ear. Ami swallowed and 
closed her eyes. She could feel Kira&#39;s hand on her thigh rubbing 
lightly. She could feel Rei&#39;s eyes on her. Feeling a bit overwhelmed she 
whimpered aloud. The sound broke Rei from her trance and she shook her 
head to clear it. Kira was still leaning over Ami, watching her with 
teasing eyes. Rei did her best to look annoyed.

&quot;Yes, yes it does. So stop.&quot; Kira grinned and pulled away from Ami 
giving the blue-haired girl a chance to breathe.

&quot;If it bothers you so much, I&#39;ll stop going after you, but in all 
honesty, not all of what you&#39;re feeling is by my hand, no pun intended.&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ami whispered, having finally caught her breath. 
Rei seconded the question with a raised eyebrow.

&quot;I mean, that while your heightened senses may be my fault, what you do 
with them and who you do it with are completely your choice. Get it?&quot; 
She teased as Rei flushed. Ami flushed deeper and started glancing 
around the room as Rei met Kira&#39;s eyes and set her shoulders.

&quot;Yeah well... the point is to knock it off.&quot; Kira shrugged and grinned.

&quot;Whatever you say. So, shall we get to contacting your friends?&quot; Ami 
and Rei nodded and Kira went about setting up the stand and video camera, 
absentmindedly pulling in some of the wisps that she ran into as she 
moved about the room. &quot;Who wants to go first?&quot; She asked and Rei looked 
over to Ami and gestured with her hand. Ami shrugged. &quot;Do you want to 
just go together?&quot;They considered it for a moment and then nodded. Kira 
pointed the camera at the couch.

&quot;What do we say?&quot; Ami asked looking over at Rei.

&quot; I guess just that we&#39;re okay and here of our free-will and ..uh... I 
guess that&#39;s it. That okay with you Mosquito-san?&quot; Kira raised her 
eyebrows at the nickname and shrugged indifferently as Ami stifled a 
giggle.

&quot; hat&#39;s fine by me Fireball.&quot; Rei snorted and Ami grinned again.&quot; Okay, 
whenever you&#39;re ready.&quot; Rei and Ami nodded to each other and Kira hit 
record. Rei spoke first.

&quot;Uh, hi everyone.&quot;

&quot;Hello.&quot; Ami seconded. Kira snickered from behind the camera and Rei 
glared at her.

&quot;We just wanted to let you guys know that we&#39;re okay.&quot; Ami nodded.

&quot;We are going to stay with Kira-san for a while though, and we didn&#39;t 
want you all to worry.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. We just figured we could use a break from school and aside from 
the big mosquito, this is an all right place to relax for a bit.&quot; Ami 
giggled again and Rei stuck her tongue out at Kira.

&quot;Don&#39;t stick that out if you don&#39;t intend to use it Fireball.&quot; Kira 
added and Rei flushed about ten degrees of red. Ami giggled again. 

&quot;Maybe we should start over?&quot; 

&quot;Nah, this should be good enough for the wonder girls. Anything else 
you wanna add?&quot; Kira asked.

&quot;Yeah! Don&#39;t you go through my stuff while I&#39;m gone Usagi-baka! If I 
find even one chocolate stain on a manga so help me...&quot; Kira practically 
fell to the floor in laughter and Rei puffed out her cheeks and jumped 
to her feet. &quot;What are you laughing at Mosquito-san? It&#39;s a valid 
concern!&quot; Ami couldn&#39;t help laughing out-loud too and Rei turned her 
attention to the girl onthe couch. &quot;Oh, you think it&#39;s funny huh?&quot; 
Unable to resist she attacked Ami and started to tickle her. Ami laughed 
under her.

&quot;Ahh-ha-ha-ha. Rei-chan! Stop! Come-on! I-m sorry I laughed at you! 
Ahhh!&quot; Finally Rei let-up and Ami laid there trying to catch her breath.

&quot;Are you two done playing?&quot; Kira asked, unable to keep the amusement 
from her voice.

&quot;Shush you.&quot; Rei said and folded her arms over her chest. &quot; I&#39;m done.&quot;

&quot;How about you Blue?&quot; Ami started at the name.

&quot;Blue? I didn&#39;t say you could call me that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah well, I just decided on it. It wasn&#39;t fair to call her Fireball 
and not give you a nickname too.&quot; Rei grinned at Kira.

&quot;Yes but, Blue sounds like a name you&#39;d give to a pet dog.&quot; Rei laughed 
at that and Ami turned bright red.

&quot;All right then. What shall I call you?&quot; Kira asked. She was doing her 
best to make then have a good time in front of the camera. Maybe if the 
others saw how much fun Rei and Ami were having, they&#39;d leave them alone 
for a longer time. Besides, she couldn&#39;t help wanting to show Setsuna 
what a good time her friends were having with her.

Ami was thinking hard and flushing at the same time.

&quot;I can&#39;t think of one on my own. That&#39;s weird.&quot; Rei giggled then sat up 
straight.

&quot;I know! You can call her Iceball!&quot; Ami and Kira both made faces.

&quot;Iceball?&quot; Ami asked, trying the name out. Kira shook her head.

&quot;No, not Iceball. Snowball?&quot; Ami made another face and Rei grinned.

&quot;Snowflake.&quot; She said. Kira grinned and Ami blushed a bit.

&quot;Yeah. Snowflake is perfect. So Snowflake, got any last words for the 
camera?&quot; Rei and Ami both started.

&quot;You left it on?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Naturally. Why press stop? This stuff is gold. I may want a copy.&quot; Rei 
flushed but Ami was thinking. She opened her mouth to talk, but then 
closedit again. She made a face and tried again, but stopped and got a 
very embarrassed look on her face. 

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Yeah, go ahead and say it.&quot; Kira urged. Ami sighed and realized that 
she was going to be teased for this no matter what, but it had to be 
done.

&quot;Um, well, I know it&#39;s summer and all and there aren&#39;t any classes but, 
uh... I do have summer school prep classes and if someone could maybe go 
and write down the homework so I can make it up later...&quot; She trailed 
off in a fierce blush as both Rei and Kira dropped to the ground in 
laughter. 

&quot;Homework? That&#39;s not a very vacation-like thing to say Ami-chan.&quot; Rei 
said and then tackled Ami and started to tickle her again. Gathering her 
breathe Kira saw her chance. She took a deep breathe and put on a 
serious face and pointed to camera at herself.

&quot;As I&#39;m sure you can see, your friends are doing just fine. Why not do 
them a favor and let them have their vacation? Give them a break from 
you for just a little while. For their sakes huh? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m 
about to hurt them or anything. I&#39;m doing more for them now then you, 
more specifically three of you, ever have. Maybe I&#39;ll let them go back 
to you in a while, maybe not. Either way, they could use this break from 
you, from all of you.&quot; She looked straight into the camera with the 
knowledge that Setsuna would watch the tape too. After looking into it 
for a second, she turned it back to the couch where Ami and Rei were 
settling down. &quot;All right, ready to say your goodbyes?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about us, we&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Ami said and Rei nodded.

&quot;We can handle Mosquito-san so just relax for a while okay? See you 
soon&quot; They both smiled at the camera and waved and Kira hit the off 
button.

&quot;I think that went well don&#39;t you?&quot; Kira asked as she rewound the tape. 
Rei shrugged.

&quot;So, how are they going to see this thing again?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m going to take it to them. I&#39;ll wear this little camera on my shirt 
and and earpiece and microphone when I go. That way you can see where I 
am going on the TV and we can communicate.&quot;

&quot;You trust us enough to leave us here?&quot; Ami asked and Kira smiled.

&quot;This isn&#39;t a place where you can just run out and disappear into the 
town Snowflake. This is one of my special homes in a, well, a different 
dimension so to speak. There&#39;s not really anything outside. You&#39;re 
welcome to try and run away if you&#39;d like, but you won&#39;t get very far as 
humans. And if you run into a particularly hungry demon outside...&quot; Ami 
gulped and Rei sighed.

&quot;I suppose that doesn&#39;t matter. Running away would be counter-vacation 
and I&#39;m enjoying being waited on.&quot; Kira grinned.

&quot;I&#39;m glad we agree. Besides, I will do my very best to make this a 
very... pleasurable vacation for you.&quot; Teasing and flirting with them 
was just too much fun and Kira enjoyed their reactions. Widened eyes, 
quickened breaths, increased blood-flow to certain areas...

&quot;Yeah yeah yeah. Just get going Mosquito-san.&quot; Rei grumbled, forcing 
theblush from her cheeks. Kira grinned and finished attaching the 
earpiece and camera. Satisfied that there was a stable connection she 
picked up the tape, waved, and poofed away appearing again near Rei&#39;s 
shrine. 

&quot;Hello? Can you hear me?&quot; Kira asked.

&quot;Yeah we can hear you.&quot; Came Rei&#39;s voice in her ear.

&quot;So, where am I taking this too?&quot; She asked. There was some discussion 
on the other side and Kira took the time to stretch and breathe in the 
air. Being an old vampire she had the ability to walk in the sunlight as 
did Akio. Only when she had been very young did the sun hurt, but now 
she enjoyed the warmth and stretched out in it.

&quot;Either take it to Usagi-chan&#39;s house or to Haruka and Michiru&#39;s 
place.&quot;Ami said through the earpiece.

&quot;Usagi&#39;s house is closer so I&#39;ll go there. Will she be home this time 
ofday?&quot; Kira asked as she started to walk.

&quot;Nah. Usagi-chan never stays home over summer. Everyone is probably at 
the Crown.&quot; Rei answered.

&quot;Okay then.&quot; Kira sighed and put her hands behind her head. The birds 
were singing, there was a slight breeze, it really was a beautiful day.

&quot;Um, hey, Kira-san?&quot; Rei&#39;s voice asked hesitantly from her ear. 

&quot;Yeah?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I mean, why aren&#39;t you... how come you can...&quot; Kira stopped 
walking and cocked her head to the side.

&quot;How can I what Fireball?&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re just walking around, in the daytime. With no cover or 
anything. So, why aren&#39;t you... dead?&quot; Kira started then grinned and 
kept walking. 

&quot;Ah yes, the sunlight. Well, with the downfall of the Kingdom, a lot of 
valuable information was lost in royal libraries. Among the lost 
knowledge was all the facts about vampires. When a few small details 
like &#39;bloodsuckers&#39; got out, you humans created the myth of the vampire 
that you see in TV.Oh sure, you got some stuff right. Needing blood, 
liking the taste of virgins, not drinking from the dead, but you also 
got a lot of stuff wrong. Forexample, sunlight. Only some of us can&#39;t go 
out in the daytime. Almost all new vampires can&#39;t, and a few species.

&quot;Species?&quot; Rei asked. Kira sighed and crossed the street.

&quot; Yeah, not all vampires are the same you know. The kind you are 
depends on who turned you and how, who you are, age, sex... yada yada. 
Anyway, several vampire species exist. There are a few that can&#39;t go out 
in daylight, and a few that can&#39;t go out in moonlight actually.&quot;

&quot;And which are you?&quot;

&quot;Well, I was lucky so to speak. I can go out in both.&quot;

&quot;So, what&#39;s your weakness then Mosquito-san?&quot; Kira laughed.

&quot;Like I&#39;m about to tell you Fireball. Anyway, I&#39;m here.&quot; Kira looked up 
at the house. &quot;Should I just leave it in her room?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that should be fine.&quot; Kira nodded and went around the back of 
thehouse. Finding a window she jumped into a tree and peaked inside. * 
Hmm, bunnies and hearts and moons. Yep, this is the right room.* She 
went to open the window and froze. Curled up in the middle of the bed was 
a small blackcat.

&quot;Hey guys, can her cat talk like it used to be able to?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, both Luna and Artimes can.&quot; Kira grinned.

&quot;Luna? Setsuna-san used to talk about an advisor named Luna. You know, 
she sounded like she was quite the pompous windbag back then. Maybe I&#39;ll 
just...&quot; 

&quot;Mosquito-san, you&#39;re not gonna hurt her are you? Mosquito-san?&quot; Kira 
grinned and slipped inside the window. Silently she crept over to the 
bed pausing only briefly as something on the dresser caught her 
peripheral vision.She focused her head and consequently the camera on 
Luna and reached out to the side scooping up the two transformation 
wands that lay on top. * These may come in handy later* she thought as 
she stuffed them into her pocket then grinned. Moving so she was right 
in front on Luna she allowed her fangs to show and her eyes to glow 
bright blue. 

&quot;Wake up Kitty.&quot; she hissed and watched as Luna&#39;s eyes blinked open and 
the black ball of fur yelped in kitty-panic and flew across the room. 
Kira moved just as fast and caught Luna, holding her at arms length. 
&quot;Are you awake Kitty?&quot; She hissed and Luna nodded slowly.&quot; Good, perhaps 
you&#39;ve heard of me? I&#39;m the one who paid the senshi a visit a few days 
ago, sound familiar?&quot; Luna&#39;s eyes widened and she nodded again. Kira 
smirked and she heard a soft giggle over her earphone. &quot;Listen up then.&quot; 
She commanded as she pulled the video tape from her other pocket. &quot;I 
want you to make sure that the others see this, do you understand? It&#39;s 
from Fir... Rei-chan and Ami-chan.If you don&#39;t let the others see this, 
then it&#39;ll be their loss cause this is the last they&#39;re gonna hear from 
those two for a while, okay?&quot; Luna nodded again and Kira dropped both 
the cat and the tape on the bed and poofed away... to the tree outside.

&quot;That was kinda mean Kira-san. And making it sound like we&#39;re gonna be 
gone forever.&quot; Ami said and Kira grinned.

&quot;It&#39;s good to keep them on their toes. Besides, if you thought it was 
so mean, then I guess it was just Fireball laughing?&quot; She could 
practically see Ami&#39;s blush in her mind as the line went silent and 
smiled. 

&quot;Do you think it worked?&quot; Rei asked. Kira watched Luna jump to the 
window and look around then run back over to something that looked like 
a watch.The cat pressed a button and started to talk. Kira could just 
make out the words.

&quot;I&#39;ve just had a visit from our new friend, she left a tape that she 
says is from Rei-chan and Ami-chan... Yes... No, I don&#39;t know, she 
didn&#39;t say..... No you can&#39;t come here, your parents are home.... Good, 
come and get the tape and we&#39;ll all go to Makoto-chan&#39;s house... Yes, 
make sure Artimes comes too.&quot; 

&quot;I think it worked fine. So, are you satisfied?&quot; Kira stretched and 
listened to them talk for a minute, watching Luna pace around the room.

&quot;Okay, that&#39;s good.&quot; Ami said and Kira focused for a moment 
disappearing from the tree and reappearing in the living room behind 
them. They both jumped and Kira shook her head as she pulled the 
earpiece and camera off.

&quot;Hey, what was that little thing the cat was talking into?&quot; Ami looked 
blank for a moment then had a moment of clarity.

&quot;Oh, you mean the communicator? We all have one.&quot; Kira raised her 
eyebrow at them suspiciously and both girls looked a bit confused. Then 
Rei caught on and shock her head, waving her arms in front of her.

&quot;Oh no, we don&#39;t have ours with us. We didn&#39;t have them on when you, ya 
know, kidnapped us.&quot; Kira rolled her eyes at Rei and resisted the urge 
to stick her tongue out. She knew they didn&#39;t have anything with them 
when she&#39;d taken them, that was the plan, but you never knew. 

&quot;I&#39;ll go put this stuff away, all right?&quot; They both nodded and Kira 
carried the gear into her private room stuffing it into a drawer along 
with the henshin wands. When she came back into the room both girls were 
stretched out on the couch. &quot;So, now that your friends are taken care 
of, what do you say you really start to loosen up and enjoy your 
vacation?&quot; Rei raised an eyebrow at her and looked over to Ami who just 
shrugged. 

&quot;I thought this was vacationing.&quot; Kira did her best to hide a predatory 
grin.

&quot;But there are so many more things that can be done to... enhance your 
experience.&quot; She said softly walking around the side of the couch so she 
was behind Rei. Rei caught onto the tone in her voice and swallowed 
before sitting up a bit straighter. She looked across the couch at Ami 
who was a little red having also caught onto Kira&#39;s subtle tone.

&quot;L...Like what?&quot; Rei stammered out, sounding almost normal. Kira again 
had to hide a smile as she dropped to her knees behind Rei moving so her 
mouth was right next to Rei&#39;s ear as she whispered.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. There are so many things that could make you feel 
good.&quot; Slowly she lifted her hands and put them on Rei&#39;s shoulders, 
feeling the girl tense up even more. &quot; But you know what I would really 
recommend right now? Something I think would make you feel so good?&quot; She 
let every word drip with innuendo and tightened her grip on Rei.

&quot;W... What?&quot; Rei managed to squeak. Kira grinned.

&quot;A nice... soothing... calming... massage.&quot; and with that she rubbed 
the shoulders in front of her. Rei had untensed at &#39;massage&#39; and then 
melted as Kira started in. At over a thousand years old she&#39;d had plenty 
of practice and she was pretty damn good at them. Rei meanwhile had 
practically started to moan and Ami was watching with just an amused 
smile.

&quot;You know Mosquito-san, &quot; Rei drawled sleepily, &quot; when you started 
talking I thought for sure you were gonna try something.&quot; Kira kept the 
grin off her face and kept methodically rubbing. 

&quot;Try something?&quot; She asked. Rei leaned back into her touch and sighed 
inpleasure.

&quot;Yeah, you know, like sexual or something. I didn&#39;t think it would be 
just a massage.&quot; Kira let Rei lean into her more and then focused on 
Ami. Once the blue-haired girl had met her eyes she leaned forward and 
spoke with her most sultry voice into Rei&#39;s ear.

&quot;You&#39;re right. This is out of character for me. Of course, there are 
full-bodied massages...&quot; She whispered putting emphasis on the 
&#39;full-bodied&#39; part. Both Ami and Rei gulped quietly but apparently Rei 
had come to an inner conclusion. So she tilted her head so she was 
almost face to face with Kira, enjoyed the almost startled look on the 
vampire&#39;s face and started to whisper.

&quot;If you do those as good as you&#39;re doing this, count me in.&quot; Kira gave 
Rei a very pleased very seductive look and glanced back at Ami who had 
turned a pretty shade of fushia.

&quot;And how about you Snowflake?&quot; Ami looked between the seductive look on 
Kira&#39;s face and the dazed, happy look on Rei&#39;s face. Then she smiled and 
shrugged.

&quot;Sure, count me in.&quot; Kira kept the seductive look on her face but 
inwardly cheered and jumped up and down. * All right. Now I&#39;ll show them 
just why they won&#39;t want to leave*</pre>
