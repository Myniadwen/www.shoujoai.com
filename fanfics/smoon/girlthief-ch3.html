<h1>The Rich Girl and the Thief (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chibistar.html">Sailor Chibi Star Fighter</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/girlthief-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>      &quot;Urgh...&quot; Seiya muttered as she climbed up the trellace.  &quot;I 
never liked houses with more than one floor....and this one has TEN!!&quot;

      The trellace led all the way to the highest tower of the 
mansion.  The young thief was like a monkey when it came to climbing 
but it was very tiring after all.

      Once she reached the tower she found the window unlocked and 
open.  With cat-like stealth, she jumped through the window and landed 
on the green carpet without making a sound.

      &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

      Seiya spun around to find herself face to face with the girl she 
had rescued form the officer standing right behind her.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      &quot;So...your name is Yaten?&quot;

      The silverhaired girl smiled and nodded.  &quot;I want to thank you 
again for saving me from that officer.  Father is out of town and I&#39;m 
afraid Ms. Karina is never home.  And she would never bail me out....&quot;

      Seiya already didn&#39;t like the sound of the Karina person.  &quot;Why 
would your father leave you with someone like that??&quot;

      Yaten looked down.  &quot;Father was never home very much to begin 
with....and after mother passed away he started to stay away longer.  
I look so much like her that he couldn&#39;t bear to look at me..&quot; tears 
filled the girl&#39;s eyes.

      Seiya cringed.  She had touched a sensitive spot..  &quot;G-gomen...&quot;

      &quot;Daijoubu!&quot;  Yaten wiped her eyes.  &quot;Its no big deal, really.  
I&#39;m fine.&quot; she smiled brightly.  &quot;So, whats your name?&quot;

      Seiya smiled and flashed her a grin.  &quot;No one calls me by my 
given name, everyone just calls me Faitaa.  Because I&#39;m a Fighter!&quot;  
She winked.  &quot;Don&#39;t tell anyone, but my real name is Seiya.&quot;

      Yaten smiled back.  &quot;I&#39;m good at keeping secrets!&quot;

      Seiya blinked.  Why...?  Why am I giving away my secrets?  I&#39;d 
better be careful not to say anything about the gang or the boss&#39;ll 
kill me!  Kai probably would too.....  Kai.  Where is he?

      &quot;Hey, Yaten.  Did you see where the boy I was with went?&quot;

      &quot;Oh, no I didn&#39;t.  Sorry.  Is he your boyfriend?&quot;

      Seiya felt herself flush, &quot;Iie.  Just a friend.  He&#39;s like my 
adopted brother.&quot;  Seiya had never liked boys.  Not once had she had a 
crush on one at all.  And the boys at the hideout were very handsome 
choices for a girl, and sometimes she wondered why she never even felt 
anything for any of them.

      The buzzer went off.  Yaten looked up startled.  &quot;Oh my!  The 
pie!  I nearly forgot all about it!&quot;  The silverhaired girl jumped up 
and ran into what Seiya assumed was the kitchen.  She came out with 
the largest apple pie Seiya had seen in her life.  Which actually was 
just the second she had ever seen.  She had never tasted one though.  
Yaten smiled widely.  &quot;You want some?&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      &quot;Oh Kami that was good...&quot;  Seiya patted her stomach.  &quot;Very 
good!&quot;

      Yaten smiled and stood to put the empty dishes in the kitchen 
but Seiya stoped her.  &quot;I&#39;ll take them.&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      When Seiya stepped into the kitchen she noticed that the sink 
was full of dirty dishes.  After a few minutes all the dishes were 
cleaned and Seiya went to put them in the cuboards.  She found about 
50 solid silver dishes.  She got dollar signs in her eyes.  
&quot;Oh..my....&quot;

      After checking to make sure Yaten was asleep Seiya took two of 
the dishes and headed out into the night.  The boss&#39;d be happy about 
her find.  And even better, he&#39;d make her go back.  That way Seiya 
could see Yaten again!
