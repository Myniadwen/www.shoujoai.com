<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 30 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/etercity-ch29.html">Back to Part 29</a><pre>Captain Ruri scowled as weapons fire rocked the
Nadesico-4, the ship&#39;s shields dissipating the energy
but not the force of the assaults. &quot;Has the ground
team reported in yet?&quot; the small woman asked, her blue
hair tied back in twin ponytails. With her large eyes
she could almost be called cute, but there was nothing
cute about her grim expression.

Miyuki checked her ear-piece, listening. &quot;They&#39;ve made
contact with the enemy.&quot; The redhead paused a moment,
&quot;We have confirmation, the illegal boomeroid plant is
here.&quot;

&quot;Send confirmation back to Crystal Tokyo,&quot; Ruri
ordered crisply. She smiled as she looked at the
monitor and the armed ships that hovered in the debris
cloud, &quot;I wonder, do they know how badly they&#39;re
compromised?&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Priss Asagiri said grimly, her reddish
brown hair in it&#39;s usual messy style. Like the other
men and women on the bridge she was in the uniform of
the Earth Self-Defense forces, though hers carried the
Hard-Suit Corps insignia. Quietly she added, &quot;Wish I
was down there with the ground team.&quot;

&quot;One of the disadvantages of gaining rank,&quot; Lieutenant
Tylor said mildly from the weapon&#39;s station, his messy
brown hair falling into his eyes, &quot;is having to sit
out things like this.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Priss sighed.


Down below them on the planetoid named Xena a pitched
battle was going on, one a bit more evenly matched
than the one going on in orbit. Cyber Six smoothly
ducked under an attack, her black leather clad body
eerily graceful, then she struck smoothly with her
energy blade. A product of her Juraian upgrade the
ice-blue saber was almost hideously effective, slicing
the boomeroid in two with a single strike.

Over on the other side of the battlefield a crack
Hardsuit team was breaking into the command center,
raiding for incriminating data and evidence of the
creators of this plant, while Cyber Six fought with a
group of more... unusual troops to launch an attack on
the plant itself.

&quot;Tonight is a good time to kill,&quot; Alucard laughed,
grinning a fangy smile as he used twin silver pistols
to cut a boomeroid down. The red suit and hat the
vampire wore suited his savage nature, even more so
now that he was destroying non-human foes.

&quot;Don&#39;t slow down,&quot; Major Motoko Kusanagi ordered them,
the brown haired officer using her own pistol
sparingly, instead relying on her cybernetically
enhanced strength, &quot;it looks like they&#39;ve activated
every boomer in the plant to attack us.&quot;

&quot;They have to know it&#39;s a waste of time,&quot; Nuku Nuku
noted, the redhead cheerfully tossing several
sexaroids aside. The catlike girl fought with pure
enjoyment, unleashing combat-android abilities that
she normally held in check as Lady Venus&#39; secretary.

Cyber Six smiled slightly, &quot;They&#39;re probably unaware
that we&#39;re just a distraction for the primary team.&quot;
She dissipated her sword to create a energy shield,
blocking the fire from a combat boomer as their newest
arrival raced in to deal with it.

Devilman Lady struck ruthlessly, her fur shrouded body
dodging energy bolts to close with her foe. Grabbing a
arm in each hand she tore the boomer in two,
discarding the pieces casually as she raced forward to
battle a few more. Howling her fury she lead the
charge, yet seemed mildly surprised when the others
kept pace.

&quot;Major, I think you&#39;re up,&quot; Alucard said mildly as
they hit the main doors, massive sheets of superdense
alloy sealed from within.

&quot;It won&#39;t take long,&quot; Motoko Kusanagi smiled faintly
as she took a connector cable from her belt, plugging
into a port at her neck then into a access hatch by
the door. She closed her eyes as she interfaced with
computer systems, handling the security protocols with
ease as she swiftly opened up the main doors.

&quot;Ewww,&quot; Nuku Nuku made a face as they saw what awaited
within.

Suspended in the middle of the chamber was a obscene
fusion of the organic and machine, a nano-machine
assembler. Resembling a mix of a still beating human
heart and an alien womb it took in construction
materials at one end, combined and reshaped them with
specially produced nanomachines, then spat out
completed boomeroids from the other end.

&quot;Anyone bring explosives?&quot; Cyber Six concentrated on
business, trying to ignore her revulsion, &quot;I don&#39;t
think conventional forces would work.&quot;

&quot;No need,&quot; Devilman Lady rasped out, her body
beginning to swell. First to ten foot, then over
twenty feet tall she grew, great leathery wings
unfolding from her back as she made a incoherent sound
of rage, towering over them all.

&quot;As impressive as I remembered,&quot; Alucard murmured,
smiling faintly.

With a single movement Devilman Lady tore the
monstrous creation from the roof, then with a groan
tore in two. Ripping and tearing she shredded the
assembler into so much bloody wreckage, then tilted
her head back to roar her victory to the skies.

&quot;Check the rest of the factory,&quot; Motoko ordered
crisply even as she kept a wary eye on the now
shrinking Devilman, &quot;we need to make sure there&#39;s no
more of these things around.&quot; She paused as a message
was transmitted to her directly through her
cybernetics then smiled, &quot;Good news, the other team
reports mission accomplished, they&#39;ve got the data we
wanted proving Nergal and Mesa&#39;s involvement.&quot;

The group scattered, cheered by that news as they
investigated the mostly deserted factory. Devilman
Lady shifted, her fur smoothing away to bare skin as a
exhausted Jun Fudoh murmured, &quot;That always takes a lot
out of me.&quot;

Motoko took off her coat to drape it over Jun&#39;s
shoulder&#39;s, covering her nakedness even as she said,
&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t thank me,&quot; Jun said as she pulled the coat
around her body, her long black hair flowing around
her, &quot;I did this for my own reasons.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Motoko looked at her curiously.

Jun narrowed red eyes, then she hesitated. &quot;The sort
of things this place created,&quot; she finally conceded,
&quot;they remind me too much of what someone like Asuka
Ran might have made.&quot;

The rest of the team returned, with Nuku Nuku
cheerfully reporting, &quot;It looks like the place is
clear, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Captain Ruri reports that the Mesan forces are in
full retreat,&quot; Motoko noted, &quot;guess we&#39;re all done
here. She&#39;ll be picking us up and taking us back to
Earth once relief forces arrive.&quot;


Meanwhile, back in the city of Crystal Tokyo, Lady
Venus listened to the report from the Nadesico,
swiftly combining it with data packets she had already
gotten from the Hardsuit team and Motoko. Collecting
the files Minako left her office, walking down the
hall with a grim expression on her lovely face.

Exiting from a lift on the throne-level Saionji fell
into step beside her. &quot;Is it as bad as we thought?&quot; he
asked, long green hair falling in a wave down his
back. He was in a simple suit, the military look
provided more in the style than in any insignia.

&quot;In a way, even worse,&quot; Minako admitted, &quot;they were
using a nano-assembler, too.&quot;

Saionji whistled softly, &quot;That&#39;s a proscribed
technology even on Mesa itself.&quot; A frown, &quot;Don&#39;t they
even care about breaking their own laws?&quot;

&quot;As long as it wouldn&#39;t blow up in their back yard,&quot;
Minako said cynically, &quot;probably not.&quot;

Miki Kaoru announced them as usual as they entered the
throne room, then they approached the throne. Queen
Serenity&#39;s face was grave as Minako gave her report,
while King Endymion looked angry, his mouth tightening
to a hard line. &quot;And there is proof of these crimes?&quot;
Serenity asked needlessly, her while-gold hair
gleaming.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am, as witnessed by our own military and field
agents,&quot; Minako answered, passing the files over.

&quot;A nano-assembler, too,&quot; Endymion blinked when he got
to that bit, &quot;they are notorious for getting out of
control. Did they not care about their own people
dying?&quot;

&quot;Obviously not,&quot; Serenity murmured. She looked at her
ministers of war and diplomacy and asked, &quot;What do you
recommend?&quot;

&quot;Formally lay claim to Xena and it&#39;s moon Gabrielle
for Earth,&quot; Minako answered crisply. &quot;We can keep an
eye on the lawlessness of the debris cloud from there,
as well as protect our own interests.&quot;

&quot;I tend to agree,&quot; Saionji nodded, &quot;we can get a fleet
presence out there in a day or so, and have a base
established in a few weeks.&quot;

&quot;So be it,&quot; Serenity nodded, then ordered the court to
be dismissed. She sighed, rubbing her eyes as she took
on a more relaxed posture, &quot;You know, I&#39;ve been trying
to keep us out of that region just because of the
problems governing it could cause?&quot;

&quot;I know you&#39;ve tried to keep it a region where those
disapproving of our rule could go,&quot; Endymion said
gently, &quot;without entirely leaving this region. But I
think Minako is right, the amount of crime coming out
of there is staggering.&quot;

&quot;And speaking as a military representative,&quot; Saionji
said mildly, &quot;having that large a portion of local
space being unpatrolled by our ships gives me
nightmares.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Serenity nodded, &quot;I may not agree, but I
see your points.&quot; She smiled a little as she looked at
Minako, &quot;And how did the latest addition to your
&#39;irregulars&#39; do?&quot;

&quot;Quite well, actually,&quot; Minako smiled, thinking about
Motoko&#39;s report on Jun Fudoh&#39;s activities. &quot;I think
she may be a asset to our operations.&quot;

To be continued....

Notes: There really is a recently discovered planetoid
named Xena with a moon called Gabrielle, though there
is an ongoing debate if Xena is large enough to be
called a planet. This chapter continues plot bits from
Chapter Twenty-seven, more or less.</pre>
