<pre>Usagi slept soundly in her bed dreaming of pink and peaceful quiet.  Her 
eyes slightly open to embrace the morning.  The only problem was that she 
was fifteen minutes late for her morning history class.

Usagi:  OOOOOHHHH NOOOOOO!!!

Usagi literally jumped out of bed and ran right to her closet, there were a 
few banging sounds heard in but she emerged dressed up for school though her 
clothes were a bit wrinkled from the mess.

Usagi:  I should have cleaned my room, I should have at least cleaned my 
closest, oh what a mess!!  Third time this week!!

She ran out of the door with her bag in hand and rushed over to her class. 
In class, the instructor was giving a brief summary of the days plan when 
suddenly Usagi barged into the door, out of breath and collapsed on the 
floor.

Usagi:  Sorry . . . I&#39;m late.

Instructor:  Hmmm, class!  This is an example of what happens when you try 
to be on time but it is well already over twenty minute&#39;s pass.

Usagi:  I&#39;m really sorry.

Instructor:  This is the third time Usagi.  You must wake up earlier.

Usagi:  Yes ma&#39;am.

Instructor:  Well, luckily for you I don&#39;t report in but if it was another 
teacher you would have already been disciplined.  Now take your seat and 
copy down whatever is on the board.

Usagi got up and walked over to her desk near the front of the class.  
Hotaru looked at her and smiled.

Hotaru:  Need an alarm clock?

Usagi looked back at Hotaru and stuck her tongue out.

Usagi:  Funny, very funny.

Hotaru:  Well, you haven&#39;t missed much, just some note taking.

Usagi:  Could I just copy yours later, I&#39;m really tired right now.

Hotaru:  Anybody would get tired after running down fifteen flights of 
stairs and running half way through the palace just to get to History 124.  
I bet you could be part of the 100 meter dash team.

Usagi stuck her tongue out again and turned away and laid her head down.

Usagi:  Awwwww shaddup!!

After class Hotaru and Usagi walked out and headed towards their locker.

Usagi:  Class was boring.  I didn&#39;t learn anything.

Hotaru:  Maybe if you paid more attention rather than trying to draw our 
instructor.

Usagi blushed and sweatdropped.  Not only she didn&#39;t do anything in class 
but her sketches didn&#39;t quiet look like the way she wanted them to be.

Hotaru:  Well I got two hours before I got Art.

Usagi:  Ha, I got two hours as well before Gymnastics.

Hotaru:  Always the physical type aren&#39;tcha.

Usagi:  Hey, Aunt Minako is the best!  I wanna be just like her!

Hotaru:  Yeah I heard this before, you also wanna be as good as a cook as 
aunt Makoto, be as smart as Aunt Ami, be good in music like aunt Rei and 
Michiru.

Usagi giggled.

Usagi:  Nothing wrong with having a lot of goals.

They got to their locker and were fumbling with their locks.

Hotaru:  Well maybe if you be a bit more responsible.

Usagi:  I am responsible!

Usagi opened the locker and a mess of paper and books fell out, including 
weeks old lunches that she hadn&#39;t ate.

Hotaru:  Yup!  Your responsible for this mess alright.

Usagi:  Awwwwww shut up!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotaru finished her last class for the day and waited for Usagi to finish 
hers at the Physical Training Center.

Hotaru:  La, la, la, five more minutes more.

Girl1:  Hey Hotaru, what&#39;s shaking?

Hotaru:  Nothing much, just waiting for Usagi.

Girl1:  Aren&#39;t you two a lovely couple.

Hotaru:  So many may say.

Girl2:  Hotaru!  Hey!  Waiting for Usagi again?

Hotaru:  As always.

Girl2:  Lucky!  Always getting the cute lovable huggable ones!

The three chat a bit when a few other friends appear at the scene.

Boy1:  Hey girls, what&#39;s up?

Girl1:  Nothing Boni.  You just finished class?

Boy1:  Yeah, I just hate Math!  The teachers freaky!

Girl1:  Not as freaky as you and Regal.

Boy2:  Did I hear my name?

Girl2:  Um yeah, it has.

The girls giggled a bit.

Boy1:  Oh there you are Regal.

Hotaru:  Some how it just seems strange.

Girl1:  What, that these two are dating?

Hotaru:  No I mean their names!

Boy1:  My name is cool, Boni!

Girl2:  You&#39;ve got a girl&#39;s name Bon Bon!

Girl1:  And Regal?  Your not even royalty.

Hotaru:  Yeah, Usagi is!

Boy2:  So what?  I mean what sorta name is Linka and Rira.

Girl1/Girl2:  Shut up gay boys!

Boy1:  You too!

Boy2:  Your gay too!

Girl1:  Wrongo!  We&#39;re lesbians!

Boy1:  Same thing!

Boy2:  Yeah!

Girl2:  Like whatevers!

The four argue on the side while Hotaru watched in amusement, things always 
seem comical with those four.  They argue a lot but they never mean anything 
they say, it&#39;s all for fun.

Hotaru:  I think they should join the speech and debate team.

Hotaru looked at her watch, twenty minutes has passed.

Hotaru:  Oops, better head in.

Hotaru walked into the gym and everyone has cleared out, all except Usagi 
who was just sitting on the blue cushion mat resting.  Hotaru walked over 
and sat next to her.

Hotaru:  Hey, why aren&#39;t ya dressed yet?

Usagi:  Huh, oh nothing just um meditating.

Hotaru:  Yeah sure, whatevers.

The two giggled.  They both sat back, Hotaru passed a water bottle to Usagi 
and they both conversed.

Usagi:  I think I learned a new move today.

Hotaru:  Really, is this better than your fury fists.

Usagi:  Way better!  Anyway the fury fists need just a bit work.

Hotaru:  You mean a lot more.

Usagi:  Never mind that, lemme show you the newest move called the Usagi 
Drop.

Hotaru:  Usagi Drop?  Um okay.

Hotaru sweatdropped at the name, it just seemed too weird.  They both stood 
up in stance, they were sparring a bit.  Usagi rushed in and performed 
various punches and kicks but Hotaru managed to evade and block them.  
Hotaru started to perform her own offensive attacks but they too were evaded 
and guarded easily.  Usagi rushed in with a right hook, Hotaru guarded, the 
guard was then reversed and Usagi grabbed Hotaru&#39;s arm. Usagi managed to put 
Hotaru&#39;s hand right between her legs, Usagi got behind her, then picked her 
up and suplexed her backwards.

Usagi:  Ha ha, that&#39;s the Usagi Drop, what da ya think of that?

Hotaru clapped her hands, Usagi turned around and saw Hotaru standing 
straight up as if nothing happened.

Hotaru:  Nice but it&#39;s easy to roll out of it.

Usagi:  Nuts!  I must work on it!

Hotaru:  Maybe if you did this instead.

Usagi:  Huh?  Waaaa!!!

Hotaru grabbed Usagi&#39;s arm, placed it between Usagi&#39;s legs and got behind 
her.  Hotaru scooped her up and then dropped Usagi straight down.

Usagi:  Ooouuuuuu HOTARU!!!

Hotaru:  Maybe so maybe something like that.  I call that, Hotaru Drop!

Usagi smiled devilishly and front tackled Hotaru down.

Usagi:  My move my move my move!!!

Hotaru rolled over so now she was on top.

Hotaru:  Say uncle!

Usagi:  Uncle Artemis!

The two laughed as they both sat up.

Hotaru:  Usagi you smell, you should go take a shower.

Usagi:  Yeah!  I should.

Hotaru:  I think I should take a shower too.  I&#39;m starting to smell like 
you.

-----

They both headed back, away from the educational department aka school and 
headed back to the residential area of the palace.  They got to royal 
quarters which was pretty high up giving the best view of crystal Tokyo.  
Just outside in the hall heading towards Usagi&#39;s room a few people passed 
by.

Minako:  So I&#39;m telling Ami that it would be best to go down to any clothing 
store and buy some sexy lingerie and striptease for her husband.

Makoto:  Nothing like a frisky night of fun to get the juices flowing.

Minako:  Literally speaking.

Makoto:  Oh hi Chibi-Usa, just finished class?

Usagi:  Yeah, and I&#39;m not longer Chibi-usa, I&#39;m Usagi!

Minako:  Haa haa haa, we know but we&#39;re so use to calling you Chibi-usa, 
it&#39;s just a habit.

Usagi:  It&#39;s okay aunt Minako.

Makoto:  Now if you would excuse us we have to talk to your aunt Ami a bit.

Hotaru:  About sexy lingerie?

The two stopped in their tracks and sweatdropped, the teenagers over heard.

Makoto:  Um, how about we do you two a favor if you forget what we said in 
the hall.

Hotaru:  Well lesse . . .

Usagi:  I don&#39;t want any classes for a month and we&#39;re even.

Minako:  We can&#39;t do that, you need your education.

Usagi:  Well then I guess I better go tell the council what you two talk 
about in your off time.

Makoto:  Okay okay okay how about two days.

Usagi:  No, too short, two weeks!

Minako:  One week!

Usagi:  A slim offer but I&#39;ll take it, this also applies to Hotaru alright.

Hotaru:  But . . .

Makoto:  Whatever but if we hear you&#39;ve told someone we&#39;re gonna count those 
days as unexcused absence and you got not pay for a week.

Usagi:  Nice doing business with ya.

Hotaru:  But . . .

Minako and Makoto left and existed in the elevator.  Hotaru looked at Usagi 
with a glare.

Hotaru:  But I like my classes.

Usagi:  Oh come&#39;on, I need some company during this whole week, just this 
once please.

Hotaru:  Oh alright, just because it&#39;s you.

Usagi:  Great!!  Let&#39;s celebrate!

Usagi opened her door and both went in, Hotaru looked around and nearly 
collapsed from the mess.

Hotaru:  You live like a pig.

Usagi:  You live the way you live, I live the way I live.

The two finally settled down, Hotaru cleaned up a bit but it would take more 
than fifteen minutes to clean up the mess, probably an hour or two.

Hotaru:  Usagi, during this week we must clean your room.

Usagi:  Alright fine, so now that we got the week what do you wanna do.

Hotaru:  Well what do you wanna do?

Usagi:  Oh I dunno.  Just relax.

Usagi laid back on her bed, Hotaru sat next to her and looked down at Usagi.

Hotaru:  That&#39;s all you want to do, just relax?

Usagi:  Nothing like a little relaxing right?

Hotaru:  Well, we could do other things.

Usagi:  Huh?

Hotaru: laid next to Usagi and relaxed too.

Usagi:  Other things?

Hotaru giggled and smiled, she turned over so now she was on top of Usagi.

Hotaru:  Yeah you know, other things.

Hotaru licked Usagi&#39;s face a bit and sent wild shivers down Usagi&#39;s spine.

Usagi:  I see, other things . . .
