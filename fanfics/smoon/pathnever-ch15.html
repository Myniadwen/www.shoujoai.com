<p><u>Michiru’s  POV, dream</u></p>
<p><u></u>I’m…running? Why is everything so  dark?</p>
<p><em><strong>Tup, tup, tup…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong>“Where are you?”  Where could you have run off to?</em></p>
<p><em>“Waaaaaaah! –Aaaaah!”</em></p>
<p><em>I  stopped, almost stumbling. The baby…She’s crying. An invisible  force began to clench down upon my heart, making it difficult to  breathe. I response hugged myself tightly, trying to keep warm.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s cold…Goosebumps began to appear on my naked arms. If only I  hadn’t worn this dress. What had I been thinking?</em></p>
<p><em>“Waaaaaah!”  The baby cried again.</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to run back to her and calm  her fears but I could not move. Now at the crossroads, which way  should I turn? Who should I go to?</em></p>
<p><em>“Haruka…”</em></p>
<p><em>My  heart ached with pain. Why did you run away? What did I do wrong? The  last time I remember being together was shortly after we named our  little girl. Then you left without a word; there was no meetings, no  battles to be fought. Your presence just…disappeared. Why?</em></p>
<p><em>…I have to find her…I continued to walk forward, listening to the  baby’s cries become increasingly distant. Perhaps <strong>she</strong> would  know. My own tears ran silently down my cheeks, fully aware at the  deed at hand.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I thought, wishing that these words  would someday reach our only child. I am sorry cannot be here for  you. Although it is a pitiful reason, perhaps, it is something I must  do. But do not believe that it was an easy choice; it tears away at  me that I will not see you grow up into the amazing woman you surely  will become. Be strong…Grow strong into the kind of ruler our  people desperately need.</em></p>
<p><em>The journey will be difficult…and  hard, but do not give up. Do not quit! Do not run away! Whichever  goal you set for yourself, see it to the end.</em></p>
<p><em>Another tear  fell.</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps…we will see each other again one day. It is  my earnest wish that we may have such a chance. Although by then you  may feel nothing but hatred towards us, I want you to know one  thing…If only this much…I love you and always will.</em></p>
<p><u>Reality,  early morning</u></p>
<p>I slowly opened my eyes. Everything  appeared bleary and unfocused. Sweat? I felt my brow and found some  cool dampness there. A testament of my own emotions…</p>
<p>…This  was…the first time I saw that dream. I breathed in a deep sigh,  letting the images come flashing back. Why am I remembering these  things? Fragments of thoughts, emotions and dreams. Were they my own  or another’s? I saw the dream figure now disappear into the dark.  That person I saw was me and yet, she wasn’t. It was the only  explanation I had at hand. However it was not the past or the  present. How would it be possible to have a child? Certainly modern  day could not produce such a beautiful result between two women.</p>
<p>Was it the future then?</p>
<p><strong>Ping.</strong></p>
<p>Something  is wrong.</p>
<p>Through half open eyes I stared at the wall ahead  where the light rays began to converge into two separate auras. They  looked like ocean waves, forever flowing forward. For a moment of  time I could not see the difference between the two; they both bore  the color of my own aura. As I continued to watch, the one below  began to pulse. Slow and steady but unnaturally beginning to gain  momentum. Its color darkened and then expanded. Helplessly I watched  the two begin to clash, one aiming to conquer, the other on the  defense.</p>
<p>The silence…It is close…</p>
<p>There were too  many questions left unanswered. Too much…my mind pained; I need  answers!</p>
<p>I turned my head to my right and saw the space  empty. Ruka was already up? I patted the sheets underneath the quilt.  Its coolness indicating the blonde had been up for some time now. How  unusual… normally I am the first one up. Was something on her mind?  Did she have another vision of the Silence?</p>
<p>…Yesterday, it  almost seemed as though she was hiding something from me. I still  could feel it…</p>
<p>“WEEKEND, WEEKEND!”</p>
<p><strong>TUP! TUP!  TUP!</strong></p>
<p>The sudden yell startled me, causing my heart to  skip a beat in surprise. I drew my curious attention to the door in  time to see a yellow blur blow past in a rush, holding…a teddy  bear?</p>
<p>“Kaiya, will you shut up?” Ruka yell from the  bottom of the stairway. “Michi might still be sleeping! Why don’t  you act your age?”</p>
<p>The thundering  footsteps came to an immediate halt.</p>
<p>One day, I sighed.  Although I was happy Ruka was worried for my rest, I thoroughly  enjoyed having our friend stay with us. Kaiya apparently is very  energetic in the morning, something I never knew until now. It was  like we are getting closer to each other every second we spent  together. Strange though…how fast Kaiya can change moods. It is as  though her defensive walls are slowly coming down. I remember Ruka  was very similar…However I am happy that our new ‘family member’  was taking my words to make herself at home seriously, even if she  were childish now.</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Knock,  knock.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Michi?”</p>
<p>“I’m awake. It’s all  right.” I told my partner.</p>
<p>“She wasn’t the one who woke  you up, was she?” Concerned played all over her face.</p>
<p>There  was sudden quick movement. As I blinked, I soon saw Kaiya wrestling  Ruka on her back, attempting to put her into some sort of hold.</p>
<p>“I  didn’t wake her up!”</p>
<p>“AH! GET OFF!”</p>
<p>I could  not suppress a giggle; both of them were simply hilarious. I looked  down when a white object caught my eye. A white-teddy bear? “Did  you drop this?” I asked. Without another thought I bent down and  pick up the stuffed animal. Seeing this Kaiya dropped off of Ruka and  jogged over.</p>
<p>“Yup. But you can have it.” She smiled. I  gave the animal another look. It was adorable yet… familiar… I  couldn’t quite put my finger on it.</p>
<p>“Where did you get  this?”</p>
<p>“…I always had it.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”  It didn’t seem like Kaiya would carry one around; most people our  age wouldn’t.</p>
<p>“I don’t need it anymore. Besides, it  might help you get better.”</p>
<p>… “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Ruka  strolled up behind the shorter blonde and wrapped her arms around her  shoulders, effectively trapping her for the moment of  surprise.</p>
<p>“Since we’re all awake, I say we all head down  for breakfast. Or…unless you’d like to eat yours up here.” She  asked me while struggling to hold onto Kaiya, who had started to  fight back.</p>
<p>“Hey, lemme go!”</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine.  I’ll come down.”</p>
<p>“Yay! You better hurry.” Kaiya  laughed as she slipped out of Ruka’s poor hold. “Beat you  downstairs Haruka!”</p>
<p>“H-Hey!”</p>
<p><strong>Tump! Tump!  Tump!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I watched the two dash out of the room at top  speed. Hesitatingly I pushed aside the heavy covers and brought my  legs around till they were suspended over the ledge of the mattress.  Unlike my athletic friends, I found these first steps in the mornings  always tricky, especially of late. Nothing that I was proud of mind  you…Wasting valuable time was one of my pet peeves. It gave off a  sense of… laziness.<br />
  <em><br />
  </em>I walked over to mirror, taking  in my appearance. It really made me wonder if Sailor Senshi could not  grow old.</p>
<p><em>Although by then you may feel nothing but hatred  towards us, I want you to know one thing…If only this much…I love  you and always will.<br />
  </em><br />
  …I shook off the voice and left the  room.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, kitchen</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Don’t touch that!”</p>
<p><strong>Slap.</strong></p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>I  rubbed my injured hand. That’s twice in two days! The little brat  glared up at me, looking at though <em>she</em> were the one who was  hurt.</p>
<p>“No touchie.” I twitched. Why can’t she act her  own age?</p>
<p>My stomach growled again. Please hurry  Michi!</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Kaiya and I both turned to  see the most lady-like of us three stroll into the kitchen with  unmatched grace…the sight made me cringe shamefully at the way  Kaiya and I had made our entrance- wrestling and then stomping around  like a bunch of wild animals. At times it makes me wonder how Michi  can put up with us, especially now that all three of us are living  together under the same roof. Come to think of it, isn’t it her  house? I sweat dropped.</p>
<p>Michi was pulling her hair up into a  ponytail as she asked, “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Breakfast.”  Kaiya answered, looking very smug.</p>
<p>I saw Michi give me a  quick glance from the corner of her eye but I quickly averted her  gaze, finding something suddenly interesting in the living  room.</p>
<p>“You made all this by yourself?” There was an amused  expression on her face. In fact, it was bordering near  impressed.</p>
<p>Out of one eye I noticed the plate of pancakes,  scrambled eggs, sausages and toast, making my mouth water against my  will. For the life of me, I didn’t know Kaiya could cook. I never  was good at the thing; too girly. Michi usually handled it when I  came over. I’m not always a freeloader though; I pay for all the  restaurant meals. It’s just…it sorta makes me jealous that Kaiya  can do all this stuff that I can’t. Painting, cooking…not that  I’d ever admit it to them though.</p>
<p>Still…this is nice,  even better than when it was just the two of us.</p>
<p>“Haruka,  get the plates!”</p>
<p>“Don’t boss me around.” I reluctantly  trudged over to the cabinet.</p>
<p>Michi looked on. “Is there  anything I can do?”</p>
<p>“Mm…you can get sit down and eat.”  Kaiya grinned. “Oh…but I guess I should get the chair for you  before you can sit down.” She laughed.</p>
<p>Watching the shorter  blonde pull out the chair for Michi was an interesting sight; that  apron really looks out of place on her, or that’s the way it looked  to me. From the violent teen I know, that piece of cloth with strings  makes her look almost innocent. I thought about how I’d look in one  of those but quickly dispelled the horrible thought in a  flash.</p>
<p>NEVER AGAIN, I cringed.</p>
<p>“Haruka, <em>hurry</em> up!”</p>
<p>“Fine, fine.”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>Wow,  Haruka’s sure outta it isn’t she? I can’t believe I had to call  her twice just to get her to bring the plates.</p>
<p>“Here you  go.” The taller blonde handed out the plates for each of  us.</p>
<p>There was a comfortable silence as we all began to help  ourselves to the food. I didn’t touch anything until Michi and  Haruka took their share. For some odd reason, I always felt weird  when taking stuff, even if I made it. If another person might want  it, I’d leave whatever it was alone. Who knows where I picked up  that habit from…</p>
<p>“So what’s everyone’s plans for  today?” I casually asked, careful not to speak before I  swallowed.</p>
<p>“I have nothing planned.” Haruka filled us in.  “Whatever Michi would like to do I suppose.”</p>
<p>The both of  us looked at the aqua haired woman. “…Oh. Well… I would like to  stop off at the bookstore in town; our Japanese language class is  requiring that we pick up a particular novel for a case  study.”</p>
<p>Sound boring…</p>
<p>Hm? I was suddenly aware of  how the three of us were dressed. Haruka and Michiru had already  changed while I was still in my pajamas. A small blush crept across  my face. Oh well…I stubbornly thought. At least I was  comfortable.</p>
<p>“Can I meet you two there later?”</p>
<p>They  both exchanged glances, also noticing my dress wear.</p>
<p>Haruka  laughed. “Yeah, just don’t lost on the way.”</p>
<p>“Certainly.  We’ll wait for you there.”</p>
<p>Once we were done, I watched  my two best friends stand up and carry their dishes over to the sink.  Michiru was about to turn on the water to clean her plate when I  suddenly said, “It’s okay, I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>“Are you  sure?” She asked. There was a small portrayal of guilt in her eyes  but I ignored it.</p>
<p>“Yup. That includes you too Haruka.” I  mean, washing one extra plate wasn’t going to kill me.</p>
<p>“Oh…thanks.  Then…” She rubbed the back of her neck, “We’ll see you later  I guess?”</p>
<p>“Mhmm…See ya.”</p>
<p>As soon as I heard  the door close, I leaned back in my chair and gave out a small sigh.  I didn’t want to bother them with my feelings or superstition…but  I just had this bad vibe that something was going to happen today. I  wonder if this was what that little girl was warning me about…  But…even if I had told Michiru and Haruka, I doubt they’d  understand my sixth sense. Apparently not too many people have it.</p>
<p>I pushed the chair out under me slightly and laid my head  down on the table. Cool…I thought instantly.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s  events still haunted me, even as I was awake. Why did my heart  crystal become some oversized pillar? What the hell is it supposed to  be? Surely it couldn’t be a sword; although it had the hilt, it  didn’t have the body. And heart crystals aren’t supposed to be  made out of stone right?</p>
<p>Is…there something wrong with me?</p>
<p><em><br />
  How ugly. No way  that could be a talisman…</em></p>
<p>The Death Buster’s words  echoed deep inside. If it wasn’t a talisman, then what was it? All  my energy felt suddenly drained. I knew it. I had a bad heart.  There…was no way it could be pure.</p>
<p><em>… know one  thing</em></p>
<p><em>………… one thing</em></p>
<p><em>…………………  thing</em></p>
<p><br />
  “Who’s there!” I called out in a startled  voice. It…sounded like an echo, not like the little girl I knew.  But still familiar, something told me so…</p>
<p>“What…was  that?”</p>
<p><strong>CrAsh!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Huh?</p>
<p>I walked towards  into the living room to find the source of the noise. It sounded like  breaking glass. Almost immediately did I walk into the room did I  find the fallen object.</p>
<p>“A picture?”</p>
<p>Wiping away  the shards of glass from the brown frame, I slowly picked it up and  turned it over to see the photograph. There were two children in the  picture, Haruka and Michiru when they were younger. The two teenagers  were smiling. Michiru was looking at whoever was taking the shot but  Haruka seemed to have her eyes on Michiru instead. Figures… that’s  Haruka for you. I tried to get a glance at it’s background but none  could be clearly made out so I assumed it was taken in their  hometown.</p>
<p><em>‘And if she really was Uranus…’</em></p>
<p>She  just…can’t be. Haruka would tell me, wouldn’t she? If she was?</p>
<p>…The space sword of Uranus…Haruka holds a talisman…If  she was Uranus…Haruka holds the space sword…Haruka, Uranus? It…I  don’t….Haruka holds the space sword, she is Uranus. Her face in  battle, her face as my friend…it’s the same. Those eyes are the  same. They…are the same.</p>
<p><strong>DOOOOM</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The photo  slipped from my hands. All I ever wanted…Again the image of the  three of us together came to mind.</p>
<p>“…I guess… I should  do the dishes.”</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />
  A  little longer…</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, on the way to the  bookstore</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>Is there something wrong? </em>Ruka’s  thought connected to mine. <em>You weren’t really worried about  washing the plates were you?</em></p>
<p><em>…It appears everyone is in a  rush today. </em>I glanced around as we walked through the crowd. Ruka  paused, apparently thinking about my last statement.</p>
<p><em>…I  guess…But what does that have to do with us?</em></p>
<p><em>…Do you think  we will find the talismans in time?</em></p>
<p><em>Of course. </em>She thought  with confidence.</p>
<p><em>How do you know? The Silence is getting  closer. Can’t you feel it?</em> The visions of the Silence  frightened me and I do not deny it. I am afraid of failing. To have  everyone and everything disappear into nothing-ness is beyond  terrible. If it were allowed to happen then there will be no  future.</p>
<p><em>…I just know.</em> Ruka responded. I felt her take  my hand in hers as we continued to walk. Why did they feel…clammy?  I began to worry again.</p>
<p>What was this cloud looming over us  today?</p>
<p><u>Minako’s POV, school gym</u></p>
<p>I  stared down through the net into the empty volleyball court. In my  mind’s eye, each of the positions began to fill with opponents, all  waiting for me to make my move.</p>
<p>“All right!” I affirmed my  readiness to myself.</p>
<p>Now with a filled bin by my side and a  ball in my hands, I posed.</p>
<p>Here goes! I threw the ball  up.</p>
<p>“HAAAAH!”</p>
<p><strong>WHAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I’ll prove it  to them!</p>
<p><strong>WHAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>…That my heart is pure  too!</p>
<p>“YAH!”</p>
<p><strong>WHAP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“OOF!”</p>
<p><strong>SMASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Mine  is as good as anyone else!</p>
<p><strong>WHAM!<br />
  WHACK!<br />
  WHACK!<br />
  WHUP!<br />
  WHAM!<br />
  SMASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Hah…Hah…” My stance staggered  slightly, feeling the blood rush to my head.</p>
<p><u>Earlier  that morning, flashback: swing set</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>Artemis walked over.  “Hey Mina. Looking kinda down.” </em></p>
<p><em>“I’m totally  in dumpsville Artemis.”</em></p>
<p><em>“How come?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Because,  the Death Busters have gone after Usagi, Makoto, Ami and Rei.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes  they have, but everyone is okay now.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Everyone except me.  Guess I’m the total reject the Death Busters don’t even  want.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You think they have pure hearts and you  don’t?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hm?” I glared, feeling irritated at the  words.</em></p>
<p><em>“Which is a totally ridiculous idea.” The cat began  to sweat.</em></p>
<p><em>“Uh-uh…Maybe…it’s because I’ve been  neglecting volleyball. They think my heart…is out of shape and my  heart is empty without enthusiasm.”</em></p>
<p><em>He then asked the  obvious question anyone would ask next. “You want your heart  snatched? You think it’ll prove your heart’s worthy?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Huh…”  I sighed. “I don’t know.”</em></p>
<p><u>End flashback</u></p>
<p><u></u>Of  course I don’t want my heart snatched…not permanently anyway. If  the Death Busters come after it then it will prove I have a pure  heart! Question is…how do I get their attention?</p>
<p>“Oww…”  I heard a painful moan.</p>
<p>EH?</p>
<p>I quickly spotted the  injured person by the gym entrance. “USAGI?” I ran over. “Oh  no, I…didn’t hit you did I?” What kind of protector would I be  if I hurt our princess? (Even if it was with volleyballs and she  happened to be in the way).</p>
<p>“Lets just say…”  She wobbled up. “I didn’t get out of the way in time. But don’t  worry! The ringing in my ears will stop soon.” She gave a toothy  grin.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Cheer up time.  I heard you were depressed.”</p>
<p>Guess that’s a day for  volleyball…</p>
<p><u>Minako’s POV, crown arcade, outside at  the crane game</u></p>
<p><u></u>This…really sucks.</p>
<p>“What!”  I yelled as the crane machine came up empty handed. Crap, there goes  my money! I kicked the machine until Usagi came back out with sodas  in each hand. Artemis and Luna were still watching my back like a  pair of furry vultures. Please, it’s not like I’ll get heart  snatched anytime soon…I twitched, realizing what I just  said.</p>
<p>“Maybe you should give it a break?” Usagi  suggested.</p>
<p>Grr… “No way!” I shoved another coin  in.</p>
<p>Usagi took a sip from her soda and offered me mine. I  shook my head, prompting her to hold it for a little while longer. It  was annoying! The Death Busters went for everyone else’s heart BUT  mine. What’s going on here? Am I missing something? Like maybe a  pure heart?</p>
<p>The crane machine missed  again.</p>
<p>“AUGH!”</p>
<p>“Mina…you really don’t your  heart snatched do you?” My ‘twin’ and good friend worriedly  asked.</p>
<p>“Who told you something silly like that?” I glared  at the machine while watched my friend with the glass’s  reflection.</p>
<p>“A little birdie with white fur and drooping  whiskers.” Luna snitched. Already I could hear Artemis  whimper.</p>
<p>“No, I actually don’t care.”</p>
<p>“See? I  told you no one would want their heart snatched.”</p>
<p>“Unless  that no one had a pure heart that was over looked. That negative  forces would love to have.”</p>
<p>“Woah, obsessing.” I heard  Usagi accuse. “Look! You don’t want your heart snatched.” She  grabbed my collar, forcing me to step back into the glass. “Once  they take it, they don’t give it back!” She wailed.</p>
<p>Vaguely  I was aware that my hand was sliding all over the game’s controls,  trying to keep on balance.</p>
<p>“But I’ll get it back.” Not  like I’d let anyone take it! I don’t want to die young! Er…wait.  It’s pretty much impossible to die old for me isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Blep.  Blep.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We both paused to see the crane had more than a  grip on a group of toys.</p>
<p>“Woah, jacket pot!” We  blinked.</p>
<p><u>Walking away from crown arcade</u></p>
<p><u></u>I  glanced over at Usagi who kept staring at me like I was some freak at  the circus.</p>
<p>“Look, it doesn’t matter to me.”</p>
<p>“But…”  Somehow she knew I was lying but I didn’t care.</p>
<p>“I need to  be alone for a bit. Can I talk to you later?”</p>
<p>“Ah…S-sure…”</p>
<p>I  left my friend, walking quickly away. It wasn’t that I disliked  Usagi, it’s just…Why did I have to be the one overlooked? When  you think about it, it’s seems illogical that anyone would want  their heart crystal to be snatched and potentially die but that’s  not the point! My heart is as good as anyone else’s. I bit my  bottom lip. There must be something I’m doing wrong! Maybe I’m  not giving enough? My eyes fell onto the two bags of toys I held in  my hands. It could be a start couldn’t it? Perhaps I should also  consult professional help.</p>
<p>I know! There must be a book on  this somewhere right? People must be asking this sort of question all  the time!</p>
<p>“Then that’s it. I’ll go to the bookstore.”  My mind had been made up.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup, tup,  tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Bookstore</u></p>
<p><u></u>I scanned the  books on the shelves one by one, watchful for each title. Nope…nope,  nope…AH! Here’s one. With a free hand I pulled the cover out and  read the title aloud in my mind. ‘Guide to a Pure Heart’. The  discovery almost made me feel giddy. My hands nearly fumbled with  excitement, hoping that I would find my answer here.</p>
<p>Now let’s  see. I opened the book to its first page.</p>
<p>‘A pure heart is  one that can be completely absorbed in something. A pure heart is  dedicated and focused. It is determined to do what it perceives as  good and worth while…’</p>
<p>Well, I’m all of those things.  What more does it take to get heart snatched?</p>
<p>“Hey Mina.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” I noticed Haruka and Michiru standing down the  aisle for the first time.</p>
<p>“Hi.” Michiru greeted, bringing  me out of my ‘am I dreaming’ state.</p>
<p>“Hey you two, what’s  going on?” They both seemed to freeze or rather look suddenly  tense. “You…have a minute? There’s something I’d like to ask  you.” I turned to face them directly. “What do you think makes  someone have a pure heart?”</p>
<p>“…hear what I  heard?”</p>
<p>“…think she knows…?”</p>
<p>I barely  caught their whispers.</p>
<p>“What?” I asked.</p>
<p>In turn  they repeated my question. “What?”</p>
<p>“I wanna know how you  think people with a truly pure heart should behave. Do you think  they’re different?” I tried again.</p>
<p>“Sure, why else would  they be targets?” Haruka replied.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Haruka  meant that they target people who need help; pure hearts like to  give.” Michiru filled me in. Now that made more sense!</p>
<p>Hmm…They  like to help people and they give…</p>
<p>My ears perked up when I  heard, “Give the gift of life, come to our blood  donation…”</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>“Did we help?”</p>
<p>“Tons,  bye!”</p>
<p>That’s what I’ll do! I’ll donate blood! A pure  heart would surely do something like that…and perhaps…that’ll  prove my worth to those Death Busters.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Do you think it was a coincidence?” I asked  my partner. For a moment there I had a scare; I thought Minako knew  something about the purity force.</p>
<p>“I’m sure. It must have  something to do with boys.” Michi giggled.</p>
<p><strong>Clang!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>At  that moment Kaiya came bursting through the store’s entrance.  Huffing and puffing she peered around, looking for us (I’m  guessing).</p>
<p>“Kaiya! Over here!” I called her over.</p>
<p>Her  head spun this way and a smile appeared on her tired face. As she  made her way over I heard Michi tease, “Have a good run?” Now  what was she smiling about? Michi was wearing that ‘I know  something you don’t’ smile.</p>
<p>“Didn’t get lost did you?”  I joined in. “I told you not to.”</p>
<p>The shorter blonde  brushed the comment off. “Yeah, yeah…Oh, was that Minako that I  saw on the way out? Was she in here with you two? She looked like she  was in a hurry.”</p>
<p>“Well…I think she was on her way to  donate some blood.” It was just a hunch but…</p>
<p>“Donate  blood!” Kaiya exclaimed. I knew she hated needles…</p>
<p>“Yes.”  Michi carefully chose her words. “I suppose she is trying to find  herself.”</p>
<p>An odd expression appeared on Kaiya’s face. It  looked as though she was in a state of deep concentration. So to  lighten the mood I waved my hand in front of her face.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry. I…don’t think I had  enough sleep.”</p>
<p>That would make two of us, I quietly agreed.  I couldn’t get a wink of sleep either, knowing that I held one of  the needed talismans. It meant…I always knew I’d be the murderer  but being my own executioner felt ironic. I was happy, yet sad …that  I was born for the purpose of dying. That only meant there were two  other holders to be found.</p>
<p>…I also know I told Michi not to  worry but… although it’s selfish…I want things to stay this way  for a little while longer.</p>
<p>“So what do you plan on doing  now?” I asked my sleepy headed friend as she yawned.</p>
<p>Kaiya  looked thoughtful at the comment. I saw her eye both Michi and myself  for a moment; obviously she planned on taking a hike and leaving us  both alone. “I think I’ll go find Minako.” She replied  slowly.</p>
<p>Saw that coming.</p>
<p>“All right. Then we’ll  meet up later for dinner?” She nodded and I then looked to  Michi.</p>
<p>“Sounds good to me.”</p>
<p>“Great, then we’ll  see you later.” I told our friend.</p>
<p>“Yup, have a good day  you two.”</p>
<p>We both watched Kaiya race out of the store,  looking happier than she’d ever been. She really has  changed…</p>
<p>“Think we should follow?”</p>
<p>Michi nodded.  With both girls being together, I had this funny feeling this day  wasn’t going to be as easy as I had hoped it to be. Another  possible confrontation with the Death Busters… I was…scared. What  can I do to a fight that I can never win…? I only thought about it  for a few seconds before the obvious answer came to mind.</p>
<p><em>‘Protect  the people who are important to me’.</em></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, park</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Donators please line up over here!”  Some man called over his microphone.</p>
<p>Minako must be over  there…</p>
<p>I waded through the crowd, keeping a look out for  long blonde hair and a red ribbon. Hm…Where could she be? It’s  not like she’d be hard to spot. I frowned. It was a real shame my  sixth sense couldn’t help me in these situations…Guess it’s the  old fashioned way then.</p>
<p>I took in a deep breath.</p>
<p>“MIN-A-KO!”  I shouted.</p>
<p>My ears pricked up when I heard a girly scream. At  this I rolled my eyes thinking… ‘found her’.</p>
<p>When I  rounded the small tent I finally spotted the teenager. Her eyes were  wide (and so were mine!) when the nurse pulled out this <em>gigantic</em> needle. My eyes nearly popped out as a sick wave hit me. I have  nothing against blood…or getting slashed by a sword or even kicked  in the face (although it does hurt). Needles…just seem to have a  special room for terror in my heart. Not exactly romantic is it?</p>
<p>I  waved as Minako’s pale face spotted me. Uhh… “Hi.”</p>
<p>“Kaiya.  Come over here.” She motioned.</p>
<p>Hm?</p>
<p>Minako held out  her hand and I automatically took it. Feeling it shake in my own palm  made me nervous. Only…I had no idea what I was getting into until  the needle went in.</p>
<p>“YIPE!” Her hand clamped  down.</p>
<p>“YAAAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><u>After donating  blood</u></p>
<p>Tentatively I held my own hand, still feeling  the pain from the squeeze. I…never knew…she had such a strong  grip…</p>
<p>“So why did you decide to donate blood?” I asked.  The cause was noble but I’ve come to expect people’s intentions  weren’t always as pure as they appear to be. There normally is some  hidden motive.</p>
<p>She looked up at me for a moment, but did not  comment. Instead she continued walking in a particular direction as  though she wanted to go somewhere first.</p>
<p>Huh? Hey, wait  up!</p>
<p>We wandered away from the crowds until we came across an  old swing set. I never this was here…</p>
<p>The place looked  pretty secluded. There was only a swing set. No people, any big  children’s park, only a swing set. I followed the shorter blonde  and watched as she took a seat. Not knowing what else to do, I also  took a seat.</p>
<p>The swing started in motion immediately under my  new weight. I instinctively wanted to push back and set it into a  higher degree of motion but the sight of an unenthusiastic Minako  drowned the feeling out. Seeing her sad made me sad. Michiru’s  words came back to me then.</p>
<p><em>‘I suppose she is trying to  find herself’.</em></p>
<p>“Have you ever thought  your heart wasn’t good enough?”</p>
<p>“…Of course.” Still  do. “Why? Do you think your heart isn’t good enough?”</p>
<p>She  nodded. “No one wants it.”</p>
<p>The strange comment made me  wonder the context she was implying. I was a literal person so I  automatically thought the more physical possibility. Hmm…but she  couldn’t mean that. That’s disgusting! I cringed inwardly. And  she couldn’t know about the talismans and the Death Busters, so she  must mean…</p>
<p>“Aww, that can’t be true. You’re a great  person! I’m sure you’ll find that special someone before you know  it.”</p>
<p>“…Thanks.”</p>
<p>Not what she wanted to hear? “I  mean, you’re funny, athletic, pretty, smart…”</p>
<p>“I’m  not pretty or smart.”</p>
<p>I blinked. I’ve never seen her THIS  glum. “Look Mina, you might be able to fool a lot of people but you  can’t fool me; I know you’re only acting like a ditz; you play  school volleyball don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Where did you hear  that?”</p>
<p>“I hear a lot of things.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do.”  She answered my question.</p>
<p>“Think of all the coordination you  need to play. There’s bumping, setting, hitting, serving…You also  have to read the game. That’s the hardest part. When to block, when  to attack, which position to switch to, etc.”</p>
<p>Minako gave  me a funny look.</p>
<p>“And as for being pretty, I meant it. But  you really don’t care what other people think of you right? It’s  R-chan that you really want to hear it from isn’t  it”</p>
<p>“R-chan?”</p>
<p>I leaned in to whisper. “We’re  being eavesdropped.”</p>
<p>I’ve noticed it for awhile, but it  appears that Minako’s friends had trailed along since we had left  the blood donor. I wonder why they seemed so worried that they’d go  spying on her?</p>
<p>“So, feel up for  some ice cream?” I offered, pretending I hadn’t noticed  them.</p>
<p>“Right now?”</p>
<p>“You just gave blood didn’t  you? I bet some sugar would make you feel better.”</p>
<p>“Your  right.” She began to act as her ditzy self again now that we had an  audience. “Ice cream! Ice cream!” She sang.</p>
<p>I watched the  other girl hop off her swing and began to skip over to the pavement.  As I was about to leave my spot, that echo came back to me.</p>
<p><em>…  know one thing</em></p>
<p><em>………… one thing</em></p>
<p><em>…………………  thing</em></p>
<p>But know what? Who’s voice is that?</p>
<p>“Kaiya?  Are you coming?” Minako called me.</p>
<p>“Huh? Yeah, coming.”  I caught up to her in a few steps. “Let’s go to the car, it would  be faster if I drove.”</p>
<p>“You have a car?”</p>
<p>“Haruka’s.”  I corrected her.</p>
<p>She gaped. “I can’t believe she trusted  you with that!”</p>
<p>I only grinned, causing Minako to raise an  eyebrow. “You little sneak!” She gave a playful punch to my arm  and laughed.</p>
<p>“Thank you, thank you.” I stopped to give a  short, dramatic bow.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup, tup.</strong></p>
<p>“Mina!  Kaiya!” We both turned towards the voice to see that Usagi had  found us.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey there Usagi.” I greeted. I then noticed  the bunch of cans she was carrying. “Watcha got there?”</p>
<p>“Vitamin  shakes!”</p>
<p>I could’ve sworn Mina and I were turning green  at the thought of drinking that stuff.</p>
<p>“Actually… we were  going for ice cream.” Minako informed her well meaning  friend.</p>
<p>“Oh…really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Want to come?”  There was a lot of room in the car anyway.</p>
<p>“Sure!”</p>
<p><u>On  the street, white car</u></p>
<p><u></u>Eudial waited at the park  entrance where she had seen the target go in. Now that I know where  one of the talismans are I can relax a bit. After I hit this next  target I’ll be swinging over to pay Tenoh Haruka a little visit.  Who knows? Maybe I’ll end up with two talismans today instead of  one!</p>
<p>“You’re such a klutz Usagi!”</p>
<p>Hm? Three  blonde girls walked out of the entrance and one of them…the target!  My eyes narrowed. But…it looks like that reject is there with them.  Tenoh Kaiya…</p>
<p>“Wait a minute.” I thought back to the only  known talisman holder. “Are they related?”</p>
<p>Hmm…maybe I  should wait up for a second…</p>
<p><u>In Haruka’s car, at  the ice cream shop</u></p>
<p><u></u>“I’ll stay and watch the car.  Can you guys just get me something with your own?” I handed them  the money.</p>
<p>“What? Are you sure?” Minako asked, looking  surprised.</p>
<p>“Yup. You should hurry though, Usagi looking like  she’s dying of hunger.” I laughed.</p>
<p>“Okay, we’ll be  back before you know it!”</p>
<p><strong>Tup. Tup. Tup. Tup.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  waited until they were in the store before I addressed the familiar  presence.</p>
<p>Minako’s friends weren’t the only ones spying on  us were they? You can show yourself  now.</p>
<p><strong>FwooooooOoOooOooosh.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Hi.</em></p>
<p>I  saw the girl I met yesterday appear in the seat beside me.</p>
<p><em>It  might seem odd but what would you like to be called?</em></p>
<p><em>K-chan. </em>She said without hesitation.</p>
<p><em>…Why that?</em></p>
<p><em>You  don’t remember? Hotaru chan used to call me that.</em></p>
<p>Hotaru  did? …<em>All right then.</em></p>
<p><em>You don’t remember a lot do  you?</em></p>
<p><em>Is it because you don’t want to remember? Or  you can’t?</em></p>
<p><em>Or…is it you can only remember the  bad memories?</em></p>
<p><em>You already know the answer don’t you? </em>K-chan  only smiled.</p>
<p><em>Who was my mom?</em></p>
<p><em>…?</em></p>
<p><em>You’ve  already figured it all out, yet it hasn’t sunk in…Hm?</em></p>
<p><em>Something  wrong?</em></p>
<p><em>The bully is back.</em></p>
<p>“Kaiya, we’re  back!”</p>
<p><strong>FwooooooOoOooOooosh</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I eyed the car’s  mirrors and spotted the white car behind us.</p>
<p>“Get in the  car.” I tried to stay calm. The two younger girls looked at me with  questioning expressions. “Hurry!”</p>
<p>As soon as they got in  and put on their seat belts I pushed down on the gas  pedal.</p>
<p><strong>VvvvRRrrrOOOOOOOOM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“K-Kaiya! What are  you doing!” Minako shouted. I noticed out of the corner of my eye  that she still holding onto two ice cream cones. Usagi was just  wailing in the back. However, something else caught my eye. A  motorcycle following directly behind the white car.</p>
<p>Well,  looks like we have a company.</p>
<p>“Hey, could you hand me an ice  cream cone?” I asked Minako. As soon as she handed it to me, I let  go of it. Through the front view mirror I watched the bit of ice  cream fall off and smack into the white car’s wind shield causing  the car to skid momentarily.</p>
<p><strong>Screeeech!</strong></p>
<p>“That  was your money you know!”</p>
<p>“My hand slipped.  Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Hey…isn’t that car following us.” Usagi  finally caught on.</p>
<p>“WHAT?”</p>
<p><strong>SCREEEEECH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  made a sharp right and another series of sharp lefts. Some drivers  honked back angrily but I paid them no mind.</p>
<p>We need to hide  out, some place away from these people. If anything, I know I can  take on that Death Buster if I have to.</p>
<p>“Look out!” The  girls in the back screamed.</p>
<p>Huh?  HOLY-</p>
<p><strong>SCREEEEEEEEEEECH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Constriction block.  Just my luck! I frantically searched the area for a place to hide  until I spotted an open underground parkade.</p>
<p>Better than  nothing.</p>
<p><u>Underground Parkade</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Why are  we stopping?” Usagi asked, extremely confused. Her eyes widened as  the white car had finally found us.</p>
<p><strong>Slam.</strong></p>
<p>It’s  driver exited.</p>
<p>“You’ve been very difficult. Now hand over  the girl.” The Death Buster pointed to Minako.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“No  way!” Usagi and I shouted.</p>
<p>“Tch.” The twitch snapped  her fingers and a monster exited her car’s back door.</p>
<p>“Door  knocker!” It screamed.</p>
<p>“Seal the exits!”</p>
<p>“You  got it!”</p>
<p><strong>Wham! Wham! Wham! Wham! Wham!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In a  flurry of movement all of our exits had been sealed with metal  barriers. Just great…</p>
<p>“Hey what do you think this is? A  party?”</p>
<p>I spotted the figures our enemy was referring to.  Haruka and Michiru…I narrowed my eyes, debating on what to do.</p>
<p>“Never mind, just stay out of my way. I’ll come for it  later.” She smiled at Haruka.</p>
<p>“What is she talking about  Ruka?” Michi asked her partner.</p>
<p>Haruka tensed up and  glared. “…”</p>
<p>In one movement the gun was raised in our  direction. “Don’t try to get in my way this time.”</p>
<p>Now  it was my turn to glare. The entire atmosphere tensed and became  heavy as it did warm.</p>
<p><strong>Cha-Chik. </strong></p>
<p>Here it  comes…<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Oof!” A pair of hands had pushed me from  behind.<strong><br />
  </strong><br />
  <strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“AHHHHHHhh!”</p>
<p>“Mina!”  I heard everyone shout.</p>
<p><strong>FwooooOoOoOoOosh.</strong></p>
<p>An  intense flash lit the dark room as Minako’s heart crystal emerged.  The girl immediately fell.</p>
<p>What should I do? I never planned  on Haruka and Michiru being here…</p>
<p><em>‘Or did you?’ </em>A  voice echoed inside.</p>
<p>The Death Buster stepped forward,  confident of her victory. Impulsively I lunged forward on the  offensive.</p>
<p>“YAH!”</p>
<p><strong>Whup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It was a  successful body check, sending the woman falling on her rear  end.</p>
<p>“Door Knocker!” She roared in  fury.</p>
<p><strong>WHAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Gah!”</p>
<p>“Stop it!”  Usagi yelled. She stepped between the enemy and Mina’s heart  crystal.</p>
<p>The witch was back on her feet again, angrier than  ever. “Get out of my way; I’m not about to let some school girls  ruin my plans!”</p>
<p>Usagi’s face frowned with determination.  In that instant I knew she was not about to give in to our opponents  demands.</p>
<p>“I won’t let you have it!” She declared. Her  hand shot up into the air, holding her brooch. “Moon Cosmic Power,  Make-Up!”</p>
<p>A pink light filled the room, temporarily  blinding me. I never expected this to happen… I staggered to my  feet, blinking back the shock and amazement pouring into me. Usagi…is  Sailor Moon! Miss clumsy and food obsessed Usagi?</p>
<p>“I don’t  believe it!” Multiple voices filled the room.</p>
<p>No way…</p>
<p>The  Death Buster looked slightly shocked but quickly recovered as she  pulled out an offensive gun. “Not like that’ll help you.”  Before I could move I saw a piece of metal glint in my direction.  “Let’s have your friend taste my Turbofire Buster!  HAA!”</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>“Neptune Planet Power, Make-Up!”</p>
<p>“Uranus  Planet Power, Make-Up!”</p>
<p><strong>TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHHHHHRRRRSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A  pair of arms whipped around me as the blast of fire came.</p>
<p>“DAMN  SAILOR SENSHI! Three against one isn’t playing fair!”</p>
<p>I  slowly opened my eyes when I felt our movement stop. Neptune was the  one who saved me…</p>
<p>“Michiru?” She gave a weak smile.</p>
<p>It  is her, I can’t believe it…Damn…My eyes started to tear.</p>
<p>“It’s  okay, I’m here…” She shushed, trying to comfort me as she  misunderstood my tears for fear. I never realized that I was shaking  so hard until now…</p>
<p><em>‘This is what you wanted wasn’t  it? To find your parents?’</em></p>
<p>“It’s not what we’re  looking for!” Uranus called over to us. As she did so, she returned  the crystal to Minako.</p>
<p><strong>FwooooOoOoOoOosh.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“JUST  DIE!” I heard the Death Buster cry. She fired at Sailor  Moon.</p>
<p><strong>SHHHHHRRRRSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Moon Spiral HeaaaaAAAAART  ATTACK!”</p>
<p>A blast from shot out of her weapon and met with  our enemy, the two powers clashed. Finally Sailor Moon’s attack was  deflected to where Door Knocker was ‘hiding’, bringing the  monster’s life to an end.</p>
<p>“Door Knooooooocker…” It’s  voice faded out.</p>
<p><em>No…this isn’t what I wanted…</em></p>
<p>Sailor  Moon jumped from her spot as another voice filled the room.</p>
<p>‘Venus  Star Power, Make-Up!” An orange light lit the area.</p>
<p>Our  enemy shook at the revelation. “No way…the target is a Sailor  Scout as well?”</p>
<p>“Venus Love-Me CHAIN!”</p>
<p><strong>SHHHH-SHINK!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“My  gun!” The pitiful piece of weaponry started to smoke.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>WRrrrrrrrrrrrrr- BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  witch had barely evaded and the blast hit the side wall.</p>
<p>“That’s  it, four against one is too much! I need a break!” She jumped into  her vehicle.</p>
<p>At that exact moment, one of the steel barriers  broke from the outside by the rest of the scouts who had showed  up.</p>
<p><strong>VVRrrOOOOOOOM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Woah, watch it!” The  inners ducked out of the way. Once the enemy was definitely gone from  the area did everyone relax.</p>
<p>“Is everyone all right?” Mars  called out. I could barely distinguish each scout from the other as  they stood together by the ramp exit.</p>
<p>Only everything was  never clearer before. Minako’s friends had been following us then  as well…The inners closed distance and now I could make them all  out. Rei was Sailor Mars, Makoto- Sailor Jupiter and Ami- Sailor  Mercury. My sixth sense confirms this as well; their auras all  matched…when did it get this strong?</p>
<p>Uranus walked over to  Michiru and me, her face looking solemn. “You shouldn’t have  gotten in the way. Are you all right? Hey.”</p>
<p><strong>Lubb dubb.<br />
  </strong><em><br />
    “Are we really freaks?”</em></p>
<p><em>“They say you were  cowards…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Why weren’t you there when I needed  you…?”</em></p>
<p><em>“They left me alone!”</em></p>
<p><em>“When I find  them… I’LL KILL THEM!”</em></p>
<p><strong>LUBB DUBB!</strong></p>
<p>“Let  me go!”</p>
<p>“Kaiya, calm do- Ah!” I lashed out and struck  Michiru. The blow caused the senshi of the ocean to release me.</p>
<p>I  ran past them all but stopped in front of the exit. “Kaiya!”  There was fear and worry in everyone’s faces. Maybe they weren’t  sure how to take this, well good for them! Because I don’t know  either!</p>
<p>“Why!” I shouted. I was beginning to choke up.  “Why did you leave!” My sense of rational thought fled me. There  was no way my parents would know the answer in this time.</p>
<p>“What…are  you talking about?” I heard Uranus ask. For the first time, it  looked like she was really afraid.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I  bolted, running as fast as my legs could carry  me.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!”</p>
<p>“Uranus!”</p>
<p>From behind me  there was another flash of yellow light, and I knew Haruka had  de-transformed. I heard her footsteps behind mine, just barely being  able to keep up with me.</p>
<p><strong>TUP! TUP! TUP! TUP! TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tup!  Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!Tup!</strong></p>
<p>Up ahead I saw one of  the transit buses. Not caring where I went from here, I jumped as  split seconds before the doors closed.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!” She hit  the glass. <strong>Wham! Wham!</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t turn around as the  bus began to drive away. I didn’t want to see  her.</p>
<p>“KAIYA!”</p>
<p><strong>VROoOOOOOOOOOOM</strong></p>
<p><u>Gates  of Time</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Time has shifted once more. If this  continues the seals will be broken. We <em>must</em> retrieve our  little trouble maker soon, the courts are becoming  impatient.”</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“I  am going now.”</p>
<p>“It is time?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We will  meet…at the Marine  Cathedral.”</p>
<p><strong>DOOOOOM!</strong></p>
