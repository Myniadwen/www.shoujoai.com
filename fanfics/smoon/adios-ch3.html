The night of that battle left the senshi weary of their new &#39;friends&#39;. 
Everything had seemed ok until Mitukai saw Minako in her warrior form. 
Thats when things had gotten nasty between them... 

####flash back#### 

&quot;...And this is Sailor Venus,&quot; Sailor Moon said, patting Venus&#39;s back. 
Yung Hu smiled as Venus, but Mitsukai&#39;s smiled faded and her eeys 
narrowed slightly. 

&quot;We&#39;ve met,&quot; she said coldly. Sailor Venus looked at Mitsuakai as she 
said that, trying to place where they may have met. 

Giving one more icy glare, she turned on her heal and spread her wings 
quickly, flapped them a couple of time befor crouching down and taking 
flight. Yung Hu watched her go and smiled weakly at the senshi. 

&quot;Gomen ne,&quot; he said before turning and quickly doing what Mitsuakai 
had done, leaving the senshi there alone, confused as to what had just 
happened....

################ 

Rei sighed and continued to sweep the temple stairs, waiting for her 
friends to arrive and meet Makoto. It had been three days since she 
arrived, and with the battles, the other girls had been to tired to 
stop by. And when they had stopped by, Makoto had already left to look 
for an apartment. 

Rei stood up straight and popped her back, trying to get the small 
ache out of it. As her gaze went back towards the stairs, she felt 
something rub up against her leg. She blinked then looked down, and 
smiled. 

Rei placed the broom against the temple grounds wall then sat in the 
shade on the stairs, Ace walking up to her and rubbing against her 
more. She smiled more and picked the blue cat and sat him in her lap. 
He leaned his head back and began to purr as Rei rubbed his throat. 

Rei smiled more as she heard someone call her name. Both Ace and she 
looked down at the stairs to see Ami walking up them. 

&quot;Konnichi wa, Ami-chan,&quot; Rei said, smiling up at her friend. &quot;How are 
you?&quot; 

Ami smiled and sat next to Rei on the temple stairs. &quot;I&#39;m good.&quot; Ami 
looked at the cat Rei held and smiled more. &quot;Is this Ace?&quot; 

&quot;Hai,&quot; Rei said and Ace moved from her lap over to Ami, seeming as if 
he were sizing Ami up. He then arched his back and rubbed his body 
against Ami&#39;s side and purred. Ami giggled and patted his head as he 
curled up on her lap. 

&quot;He&#39;s much bigger than Luna and Artemis,&quot; Ami pointed out while gently 
rubbing Ace&#39;s back. 

&quot;Hai, he is,&quot; Rei said looking at him. &quot;Its kinda strange tho...&quot; 

Ami looked up at her friend. &quot;What is?&quot; 

Rei reached over and scratched Ace&#39;s ears. &quot;I sense both negitive and 
positive energy from him. But, when I did a fire reading on him, I 
came up with nothing.&quot; 

Ami blinkd a few times and looked down at the blue cat in her lap. 
&quot;What about your friend?&quot; 

&quot;I did one on her too because I felt the exact same vibes from her.&quot; 
Rei shook her heda and sighed. &quot;Still nothing...&quot; 

&quot;Konnichi wa, minna-chan!!&quot; Ami and Rei turned away from the blue cat 
to see a blonde running up the stairs towards them. 

Rei snickered as she greeted her friend. &quot;Hi, odango-atama.&quot; 

Usagi stuck her tounge out at Rei. &quot;Shove it, Pyro. Hi Ami-chan!&quot; 

Ami giggled and nodded. &quot;Hello Usagi. How are things going?&quot; 

Usagi shrugged and sat next to Ami&#39;s legs, a few steps down. &quot;Ok, I 
guess. So when do we get to meet your friend, Rei?&quot; 

&quot;When ever she gets back,&quot; Rei answered. 

Usagi nodded and finally noticed the cat sitting in Ami&#39;s lap. She 
smiled and reached over to scratch his ears. &quot;Hey cutie...&quot; Ace purred 
and closed his emerald eyes, tilting his head up slightly. Usagi 
giggled and picked him up from Ami&#39;s lap and held him in her own. 
&quot;Wow, he&#39;s much heavier than Luna.&quot; 

&quot;We know, Odango,&quot; Rei said smirking at her friend. 

&quot;Shove it Pyro,&quot; Usagi said, sticking her tounge out at Rei. Rei 
retailiated and soon the two were having a stareing contest and 
blowing rassberries at one another as Ami and Ace sweat dropped. 

Someone chuckeling made the trio turn around and Ace to jumps from 
Usagi&#39;s lap. &quot;Children, children,&quot; the girl said, catching Ace as he 
jumped into her arms. &quot;That isn&#39;t a way for young ladies to behave.&quot; 

Rei smiled. &quot;Hello Makoto-chan.&quot; 

Makoto smiled and placed Ace back on the ground as she dipped her head 
low to place a qucik kiss on Rei&#39;s cheek. Rei blushed slightly as 
Makoto walked past her to sit against the wall. 

&quot;Did you find a place yet, Makoto,&quot; Rei asked turning her head so she 
could see her friend. Ace jumped up into Rei&#39;s lap and purred. 

Makoto nodded and smiled. &quot;Hai, I did. Its a down town loft. Great 
veiw of the ocean. And the place is huge! Just what I was looking 
for.&quot; 

&quot;Can you afford it tho,&quot; Rei asked, quirking an eyebrow. 

Makoto nodded and chuckled. &quot;Hai, mother, I can.&quot; Rei stuck her tounge 
out at Makoto and Makoto simply smiled more. &quot;So...are you gonna 
introduce me to your friends or what, Rei-chan?&quot; 

Rei blushed and sweatdropped. &quot;Gomen ne, I forgot. Um...Makoto, these 
are two of my closet friends Usagi and Ami,&quot; Rei said,pointing to each 
girl. The both waved and sai their hellos as did Makoto. 

&quot;So, when are you moving into your place, Makoto-san,&quot; Ami asked. 

Makoto closed her eyes, thinking. &quot;Eh,...I can move in any time, but I 
have to back to England first and send all my stuff here. I&#39;ll be 
going back next week.&quot; 

&quot;But you are coming back, ne,&quot; Usagi asked. 

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai, I am. I&#39;ll only be gone a couple of days.&quot; Makoto 
stood and stretched. &quot;I think I&#39;m gonna go work out for a bit if thats 
all right, Rei?&quot; 

Rei nodded. &quot;Yeah, its fine. See ya later.&quot; 

Makoto smiled and bowed. &quot;Ja ne, ladies.&quot; Makoto then walked towards 
the work out room in the temple, Ace jumping from Rei&#39;s lap and 
following her. 

As soon as Makoto was inside the temple, Usagi quickly turned to Rei 
and asked, &quot;Why did she kiss you!?&quot; 

Rei blinked a few times a blushed. &quot;She&#39;s my friend...why does it 
matter?&quot; 

Usagi blinked then shrugged. &quot;I was just wondering...&quot; 

&quot;Yea, sure you were,&quot; Rei said, shooting Usagi a look. 

&quot;So, Rei, is Makoto....ya know...&quot; Usagi asked shyly. 

&quot;...A lesbian,&quot; Rei finished for her. Usagi nodded. &quot;Hai, she is. I 
think thats why she kissed me. She&#39;s a major flirt. But, she did that 
when we first met on line too, so I&#39;m pretty use to it.&quot; 

Usagi smiled. &quot;So, she&#39;s still pretty cool, ne?&quot; 

Rei laughed and nodded. &quot;Hai. Very cool.&quot; 

&quot;Hey minna-chan!!&quot; The three girls turned to see their other blonde 
friend running up the stairs. &quot;Why are you guys sitting in this hot 
weather instead of inside?&quot; 

&quot;Minako,&quot; Rei started. &quot;Its summer and there is a very large fire 
inside my home...where would you wanna be?&quot; 

Minako blinked then giggled. &quot;Oh yeah...So,&quot; she began, &quot;When do we 
get to meet your friend?&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ve already met her,&quot; Ami said, pulling out a book form her large 
hand bag and hiding her face behind it. 

&quot;Nani!?&quot; 

&quot;Hai, we met her a few minutes ago,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;She&#39;s really nice.&quot; 

&quot;Man...I wish I could have met her,&quot; Minako said, slumping down next 
to Usagi. 

&quot;She&#39;s still here, Minako,&quot; Rei said. &quot;She&#39;s in the work out room.&quot; 

&quot;Can we go see her,&quot; Minako asked. 

&quot;Since these two have already met her, why don&#39;t you go by yourself? 
Ask her if she wants to go see a movie with us in a little bit,&quot; rei 
offered. 

Minako blinked. &quot;But...but...I don&#39;t know her!!&quot; 

The girls luaghed at her and Rei shook her head. &quot;Why are you so shy? 
Go ask her, Minako.&quot; 

Minako sighed and stood up. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said as she walked past her 
friends and up towards the temple. She walked up the temple stairs and 
into the temple it self, heading towards the work out room. As she 
neared the room, she could hear grunts coming from the room from the 
people inside working out. She slid the door open and saw Yuuichirou 
sparing with someone. At first she thought it was Grandpa, but she 
soon heard his voice: 

&quot;Come on, Yuuichirou! She&#39;s a woman! Can&#39;t you even beat a girl!?&quot; 

Yuuichirou ducked down as Minako saw a foot fly towards his face. &quot;Not 
her! She&#39;s too quick and tough.&quot; 

&quot;Thats because she&#39;s focused and wants to win! You are not!&quot; 

Minako giggled as she watched Yuuichirou dodge more attacks. She had 
yet to see whom he was fighting, but she did know it was Rei&#39;s friend. 

&quot;Ok, enough,&quot; Grandpa yelled. &quot;Take five.&quot; Minako heard footsteps then 
Grandpa say, &quot;That was great Makoto-san. Where did you learn those 
moves?&quot; 

Minako&#39;s eyes went wide when she heard that name. Her heart felt like 
dead weight as she hoped that the girl wasn&#39;t her old friend.... 

&quot;I learned them from my father before he passed away. Then I finished 
my training in England.&quot; 

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Minako closed her eyes tightly, trying despertly to keep 
her tears from falling down her face. 

&quot;Minako.&quot; Minako turned her head to see her friends approaching her. 
&quot;Minako, I thought you were gonna ask Makoto if she&#39;d like to go to a 
movie with us,&quot; Rei asked. 

Minako blinked a few times, trying to find her voice. &quot;I...um..&quot; 

Ami looked at her friend. &quot;Are you alright, Minako-chan? You look 
pale...&quot; 

Minako swallowed the large lump in her throat and shook her head. &quot;Ya 
know...I really don&#39;t feel very well right now. I think I&#39;m gonna go 
on home and...&quot; 

&quot;HEY! Whts going on out here!?&quot; 

&quot;Ack!!&quot; Minako fell backwards as the door she was leaning on flew 
open. When she looked up, she saw her worst fear standing in front of 
her. 

Makoto stood there, towering over Minako and stared down at her old 
friend. With a distant and cold look in her eyes.... 

~It&#39;s been hours 
seems like days 
since you went away 
and all I do is check the screen 
to see if you&#39;re okay 
you don&#39;t answer when I phone 
guess you wanna be left alone 
so I&#39;m sending you my heart my soul 
and this is what I&#39;ll say 
I&#39;m sorry oh so sorry 
can&#39;t you give me one more chance 
to make it all up to you ~ 

Minako sat at her desk in her dark room, Artemis asleep on her bed. It 
had been three days since she had her &#39;run in&#39; with Makoto at Rei&#39;s 
temple and Makoto was now back in England, tying up loose ends and 
making plans to ship all of her belongings here to Tokyo. Minako 
wasn&#39;t quite sure if she were happy that she found her old friend. Or, 
as the case may be, that her old friend found her. 

Minako sighed as she typed up another email to Makoto, trying to 
explain why she had left England. She had hacked into Rei&#39;s adress 
book on her email and that was how she had found Makoto&#39;s email 
adress. And, as she typed these emails up, Makoto was either ignoring 
the emails and not responding or just deleting them all together. 
Minako even tried calling her a few times, but Makoto never answered 
the phone. 

Minako sighed once again and hit the send button. *Just another email 
for her to ignore* Minako thought. Minako leaned back in her seat and 
streched, popping her back in doing so. She yawned and blinked then 
looked over at her clock. The clock read three- fortysix in the 
morning. 

Minako switched her computer off and stood from her desk and decided 
agaisnt cahnging into her pj&#39;s since it was so late. Instead she just 
stripped off her blue jean cut off shorts and climbed into bed after 
moving Artemis to the side. 

As she laid there in the dark, many memories of her and Makoto flooded 
her mind. So many happy memories...Minako couldn&#39;t recall a single bad 
memory that she and Makoto had shared. 

....Except one.... 

~E-mail my heart 
and say our love will never die 
I know you&#39;re out there 
and I know that you still care 
e-mail me back and say our love will stay alive 
Forever...e-mail my heart ~ 

#######flash back####### 

&quot;Kami-sama, I&#39;m in so much pain,&quot; Sailor V said as she limped towards 
Makoto&#39;s apartment. She wasn&#39;t exactly sure if she&#39;d make it or not. 
The strom had started back up again and she was soaked once again. And 
her wounds were deep and very painful from the explosian. She hadn&#39;t 
even went to Katrina for help...her first thought after that thief had 
set that bomb off was to get to Makoto. 

Sailor V smiled despite the imense pain she was in. The memory of them 
making love a few hours ago made her heart beat faster and a blush to 
grace her face. 

As she neared Makoto&#39;s apartment, she climbed up a fire escape to make 
the jump to her patio easier. As she jumped from roof top to roof top, 
hr mind whirled with what would become of them now. Minako enjoyed so 
much what had happened between her and her best friend. She just 
wasn&#39;t very sure of how her friend would react to her in the morning. 

...Sailor V gave one final leap and landed, if not very gracefully at 
least safely, onto Makoto&#39;s balconey. She stood up, the rain beating 
down on her back and head as she did so, her body hidden in the 
shadows without her realizing it. When she looked up, she saw Makoto 
in the middle of her living room being held by Alan. 

&quot;It was Alan...&quot; she said to herself, tears mixing on her face with 
the rain. &quot;...It was him...not me....&quot; Sailor V turned and jumped down 
from Makoto&#39;s balconey. Her landing was once again less than graceful 
as her body came in contact with the wet grass beneath her. With her 
head casted down, Sailor V made her way through the night.... 

With no intentions of ever coming back...

################### 

~I can see you in my mind 
coming on the line 
and opening this letter 
that I&#39;ve sent a hundred times 
here&#39;s a picture of us too 
I look so good on you 
and can&#39;t you please forgive me 
for the hurt I put you through 
I&#39;m sorry 
oh so sorry can&#39;t you give me one more chance 
to make it all up to you ~ 

&quot;Two weeks...&quot; Rei said as she layed back on her bed. &quot;Just two more 
weeks left...&quot; 

Minako sighed and laid her head on her arms and smiled a bit. &quot;Two 
weeks left...and no more summer vacations. I can&#39;t believe this is our 
senior year.&quot; 

Ami sat the table in Rei&#39;s room with Usagi and Minako, except her head 
wasn&#39;t bowed. Instead it was buried in a book. &quot;Don&#39;t forget college, 
minna.&quot; The other three girls looked at her and sweatdroped. 

&quot;But, Ami,&quot; Usagi started. &quot;This is our last year of *high school*. 
This is our *last* official summer. Once we get into college, we&#39;ll 
end up working those summers.&quot; Ami sighed and continued reading. 

&quot;Well,&quot; Minako said raising her head. &quot;This study session has gone no 
where fast. Can we just call this thing off along with the rest of 
study sessions for the rest of summer?&quot; 

They all looked towards Ami whose brow furrowed. She sighed and closed 
her book. &quot;Hai. We can.&quot; 

Usagi, Rei, and Minako all looked up at her and smiled brightly. 
Minako stood up and gathered her things. &quot;I gotta go. I have to go 
home and get ready for my date tonight.&quot; 

Usagi smiled at her. &quot;You still seeing that one guy who was in 
photoghrapy last year, Minako?&quot; 

The blonde nodded. &quot;Hai, I am. I&#39;ll see you guys later. Ja ne.&quot; 

&quot;Ja,&quot; the other three choursed together. Minako waved and left thru 
the slididng door, closing it behind her. 

When Minako was gone, Usagi turned towards Rei. &quot;Do you know what was 
up with Minako and Makoto-san the other day?&quot; 

Rei shrugged and shook her head. &quot;Iie, I don&#39;t. Makoto looked mad 
tho.&quot; Rei felt something rub up against her leg and smiled down at Ace 
who had woken up from his place on her bed, now wanting attention. She 
scratched the back of his head as he sat next to her and purred 
loudly. 

&quot;If Makoto only knew that the girl she was getting an attitude with 
was the same girl she has tattooed on her back,&quot; Usagi laughed. 

&quot;Hai,&quot; Rei agreed. &quot;I thought it was very detailed picture of Minako. 
The weird thing is, when asked Makoto-chan about it, she said she 
designed the image herself. She even showed me the pencil drawing. 
She&#39;s very talented.&quot; 

Ami remained silent during the conversation about Makoto. And no one 
noticed it since she had picked her book back up and was again hiding 
behind it again.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ 

Minako sighed as she walked into her apartment. Waiting for her was 
the only real man in her life, despite her boyfriend, Artemis. 

He meowed and ran up to her and rubbed up against her leg. She smiled 
slightly as she picked him up. He nuzzled his head against her face 
and she smiled a bit more. 

She placed him onto the couch and walked to her bedroom and sat down. 
Artemis followed her and jumped up onto the bed and sat next to her. 
He looked at her worriedly. 

&quot;Mina? Minako...? Are you alright,&quot; he asked, rubbing his head against 
her arm. 

Minako reached over to her nightstand and picked up a photo of her and 
Makoto. In the picture, Makoto was standing behind Minako with her 
arms loosely but protectivly around the blonde. Mianko smiled slightly 
at the memory. It was taken at the orphanage on Minako&#39;s 13 birthday. 
&quot;Did I tell you,&quot; Minako started without looking at the white feline, 
&quot;who i saw at Rei&#39;s temple the other day?&quot; 

Artemis blinked and shook his head. &quot;Iie, you didn&#39;t. Who did you 
see?&quot; 

&quot;An old friend from England...&quot; 

&quot;Who?&quot; 

Minako fell silent and didn&#39;t answer for a few minutes. &quot;M-Minako? Who 
did you see?&quot; 

&quot;...Mako-chan...&quot; 

&quot;NANI!?&quot; Artemis&#39;s eyes bugged out of his head as he stared at Minako 
who had no real statement on her face. &quot;How could you *not* tell me, 
Minako??&quot; 

She shrugged. &quot;Slipped my mind, I guess.&quot; 

Artemis drew in a ragged breath and shook his head. &quot;How could 
something like *that* just &#39;slip&#39; your mind, Minako??&quot; 

Minako shook her head and placed the picture back on the night stand, 
but never tore her gaze from it. &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; 

~E-mail my heart
