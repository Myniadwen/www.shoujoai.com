<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 15 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>The black haired young man entered the messy loft,
taking off his wrap around sunglasses with a relieved
sigh. The white haired younger boy looked up as he
entered and asked with a smile, &quot;Seiya, where were
you?&quot;

&quot;Out, Yaten,&quot; Seiya answered crisply, frowning at the
young man casually sitting in the chair. &quot;Any progress
on the new song?&quot; he asked, taking off the black coat
he wore.

From another part of the building a taller man
entered, a dignified air about him as he tucked a book
away. Long, reddish brown hair flowed down in a long
ponytail just like the other two young men, the
slightest smile on his face. &quot;I think it&#39;s going
well,&quot; he said mildly.

&quot;Nice to see someone working on it,&quot; Seiya smiled
wryly, &quot;thanks, Taiki.&quot;

Taiki shrugged casually as he asked, &quot;So how was your
little visit to the school?&quot;

&quot;It looks pretty good,&quot; Seiya sat down on a couch with
a thoughtful look on his face, &quot;and I met someone
interesting.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Yaten looked up from the guitar he was fiddling
with.

Seiya chuckled softly, &quot;She seemed entirely
unimpressed with me.&quot;

&quot;I like her already,&quot; Yaten quipped.

Taiki gave him a look then gazed back to Seiya, &quot;So
who is this paragon?&quot;

&quot;Ami Mizuno,&quot; Seiya said, for a moment finding himself
remembering the blue hair and those flashing dark
eyes.

Taiki sat up in surprise, &quot;Mizuno?&quot; At the other&#39;s
surprised glances he frowned, &quot;Ami Mizuno is one of
the top students at the school, of course I did my
research on her.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s so special about her to catch your eye?&quot;
Yaten asked Seiya, sounding honestly curious about the
young woman.

Seiya frowned in thought. &quot;There&#39;s something sad about
her,&quot; he admitted, &quot;something that weighs her down.&quot;
He smiled slightly, &quot;But despite that she still shines
like a star.&quot;

Taiki nodded thoughtfully and commented, &quot;Then I look
forward to meeting her.&quot; Becoming serious he gestured
to the instruments that were neatly piled in one side
of the room, &quot;Now I believe we have work to do?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Yaten sighed. He paused for a moment, looking
curiously at the other two, &quot;Do you really think we
can find her?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Seiya said as he casually picked up a lead
guitar, &quot;with every performance, every song we bring
her closer and closer.&quot; He kept a confident look on
his face while hoping that he sounded more sure than
he really felt.

The sessions went on into the evening, the three idols
working hard to refine their latest song. Finally
satisfied long after the sun set they retired to bed
to rest up for their first day of school, but sleep
somehow eluded Seiya. Restlessly he paced, careful not
to disturb the others until finally he found himself
standing outside in the moonlight.

&quot;I need some exercise,&quot; Seiya muttered, the microphone
headpiece with a star insignia appearing by his head.
&quot;Fighter Star Power,&quot; he declared, &quot;Makeup!&quot;

Rainbow light washed across a slim male body and
suddenly feminine curves were revealed. Starlight
flashed as the skimpy leather bodysuit formed, the
star insignia on her chest glowing slightly in the
darkness. Seiya was gone, and in his place stood
Sailor Star Fighter.

Fighter smiled, her eyes twinkling as she murmured,
&quot;That&#39;s better.&quot;

She was gone in a second, a single leap throwing her
high into the air. Fighter bounded from roof to roof,
careful to hide herself from anyone&#39;s view. Sailor
Star Fighter would make her debut eventually, but now
was not the time. Instead she kept to the shadows,
watching as people went about their lives unaware of
the dangers around them.

&#39;Home was like this once,&#39; Fighter thought sadly, the
sweet scented breeze blowing her black mane back, the
simple circlet she wore bearing another star emblem.
She savored the quiet, enjoying a moment of relative
peace....

...then a scream came out of the darkness, somewhere
nearby.

Without thinking about it she was off, Fighter racing
across the night towards the source of the cry. The
smart thing would be to just ignore it, or to at least
go back and get Maker and Healer, but she had never
claimed to be that smart. A second cry, cut off in mid
scream, and she moved even faster, almost becoming a
blur in motion.

The battle scene was confusing as Fighter silently
landed on a nearby rooftop, her eyes widening as she
took in all of the players. A gray haired little girl
stood to one side, studying a small brightly shaped
diamond, the light it bore flickering. Nearby a woman
dressed in sailor fuku bore a shining blade, her eyes
glowing sinister as she bore down on the screamer, who
was protected by....

&quot;Sailor Mercury,&quot; Fighter breathed out. She and the
others had heard of Sailor Senshi of this world, but
she hadn&#39;t expected to actually meet one. Her blue
hair was messy as she raised the sword she carried
with smooth competence, the scar across her nose bold
in the dim light.

&#39;She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s facing,&#39; Fighter thought
to herself bleakly, &#39;that&#39;s a Phage that she&#39;s up
against.&#39; Soulless, deprived of all their humanity,
the only thing that one could do for there transformed
people was to put them out of their misery.

The diamond flickered, then went out as the girl
Fighter recognized as Iron Mouse stamped her foot.
&quot;Another blank,&quot; she complained, stepping back into
the telephone booth that had suddenly appeared from
nowhere behind her. Iron Mouse waved good-bye
cheerfully before saying to Sailor Mercury, &quot;Well,
have fun with the Phage!&quot; The door to the booth
slammed shut then she was gone, disappearing along
with the telephone booth.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Sailor Mercury cried but was cut off as the
Phage attacked.

&quot;I am Sailor Samurai,&quot; she struck, the sailor fuku she
wore resembling ancient armor, &quot;and you are not worthy
of my blade!&quot; Sailor Mercury fought well but the
swordswoman was inhumanly fast, her silver katana
lashing out again and again to cut at Mercury&#39;s
uniform.

&#39;She needs help,&#39; Fighter thought, moving forward
without thinking about it so that she shadows no
longer hid her from view. &quot;Breaking through the evil
darkness,&quot; she boldly declared, feeling all eyes turn
to her, &quot;I am a wandering shooting star!&quot; A single
leap brought her to ground level as she finished,
&quot;Sailor Star Fighter, stage on!&quot;

&quot;Another senshi?&quot; Mercury murmured disbelievingly.

Fighter brought her star shaped talisman up as she
summoned her power then cried, &quot;Star Serious Laser!&quot;
The beam lashed out faster than light, sending the
samurai crashing to the ground trailing smoke. She
walked forward, readying another strike as Fighter
said, &quot;Now to finish it.&quot;

&quot;Wait,&quot; Mercury protested, &quot;she&#39;s human!&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; the girl who had been threatened recovered
enough to say, &quot;she&#39;s my friend.&quot;

&quot;Not any more,&quot; Fighter answered, driving any of the
sympathy she felt from her voice, &quot;she&#39;s a Phage, now.
The only way to stop her is this.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Sailor Mercury said, and the tiara she wore
faded to reveal a shining blue symbol, one that
suddenly blazed with power.

The air shimmered as the young woman appeared, the
white wings of an angel sweeping around the ghostly
apparition. &quot;Usagi,&quot; Mercury breathed out, tears
streamed down her face as the blonde smiled, her
princess gown flowing around her. The Moon Princess
reached out to touch the broach that Mercury wore,
light and power blinding in the darkness, then she was
gone.

&quot;What was that,&quot; Fighter blinked away the momentary
blindness.

A transformed Mercury held a scepter in her hands, one
that gleamed silver, decorated with a ruby, emerald,
diamond and a crescent moon. The blue cloak that had
been added to her costume swirled while she raised it,
watching as the Samurai staggered to her feet, power
and cold swirling around the weapon. She pointed it
and declared, &quot;Mercury Freezing Restoration!&quot;

Fighter gazed in shock as a wave of frost washed over
the Samurai, instantly covering her head to toe in
pure ice. She stood there frozen, utterly still, then
the ice shattered and a fully human girl dropped
limply to the ground. Black hair fell around her, the
old style clothes bringing to mind a wandering ronin
of another era.

&quot;Motoko,&quot; the other girl cried, rushing to her
friend&#39;s side.

&quot;Kitsune?&quot; Motoko managed, looking up at her friend
dazedly, &quot;what happened?&quot;

Kitsune grinned slightly, her typical impish look
tempered by pure relief. &quot;Trust me, you don&#39;t want to
know,&quot; she answered.

In a daze Fighter leapt away from the reunion into the
near darkness but Mercury was right behind her,
swiftly reverting to her normal garb as she went.
&quot;Wait, please,&quot; Mercury asked, &quot;who are you? What do
you want?&quot;

Fighter stopped a moment, the light of a street lamp
shadowing her face. &quot;A friend,&quot; she smiled before
adding softly, &quot;I hope.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Mercury started, but Fighter was off again.

The speed that she summoned sent Fighter racing into
the darkness, putting as much distance between herself
and Mercury as possible. After spending half an hour
making sure that she hadn&#39;t been followed Fighter
eventually returned to the loft, her form blurring
back into Seiya once again.

&#148;Things just changed for us, tonight,&quot; Seiya murmured
as he tiredly went inside, blinking in surprise as he
saw Taiki standing there, frowning.

&quot;Where were you?&quot; he asked, echoing what Yaten said
earlier.

Seiya grinned tiredly as he flopped into a chair,
&quot;Have I got something to tell you....&quot;

To be continued....

Note: Yes, that&#39;s Motoko and Kitsune from Love Hina.
Instead of introducing a random character to be
transformed I thought it might be fun to toss in a
character from another series... not sure if I&#39;ll use
that in other chapters. A few &#39;Stars&#39; details may be
off, I have to sit down and watch the series again to
refresh my memory.</pre>
