<p>Rei swept the leaves that scattered around the temple. She was in deep thought as she gripped the bamboo handle of the broom. <em>I wonder how Usagi is doing, </em>she thought as she swept more hastily. The girls were going to meet each other later in the evening.<em> Usagi has been more absent this past month ever since she got out of the hospital.</em> The miko finished sweeping and was about to walk inside the temple when she spotted Minako walking towards her.</p>
<p>“Hey,” greeted Rei.</p>
<p>“Hey yourself,” replied Minako.</p>
<p>Meanwhile  at the Tsukino residence, Usagi lay on the couch bored out of her mind.  School had just ended yesterday for the holidays and Doctor Mizuno told  Usagi not to over exert herself in order to regain her strength. <em>What did Minako ever do when she was in this condition? She pretty much lived a normal, wait what am I thinking? This is Minako!</em> Usagi sighed. It was already a month since she left the hospital, yet  her family was treating her as if she were a fragile doll. School,  home, and occasionally with her friends. That was it. <em>What to do, </em>she thought as she observed Luna taking a nap nearby the window. She took a small pillow and threw it at the little plushy.</p>
<p>Luna yelped and glared at Usagi. “You just ruined a perfectly good nap!” yelled Luna.</p>
<p>“Gomen Luna. I’m just bored! I can’t stay cooped up here forever! How else am I going to enjoy life when I’m stuck here?”</p>
<p>The  plushy looked at her. Luna already knew about Usagi’s condition and  sympathized the girl. Usagi had already made so many excuses as to why  she couldn’t go out with her friends as often as before. It seemed to  be working because none of them questioned it. <em>Mamoru, </em>Usagi  thought. He was in London finishing school and came back to Japan when  it was the holidays. Usagi always looked forward to seeing him. Usagi  sighed. “Luna. I really need to get out of here.” She thought about her  friends. <em>Maybe Ami? No. She’s probably with Nephrite. Perhaps  Makoto. No, she was off with Motoki today. Rei? Probably busy with  temple duties. </em></p>
<p>“Minako,” said the little plushy, “Artemis  said that she was free all day today. Perhaps the both of you could  talk, since she was the only other senshi who had to deal with the same  thing.”</p>
<p>Usagi looked at Luna. <em>It’s true that she’s probably the one who will understand this most, but should I even tell her?</em></p>
<p>Usagi  sighed once more. She paced back and forth in her room then settled on  her bed. She lay down and stared at her ceiling until her eyes ached  from strain. Finally, Usagi picked up her phone began to dial numbers.  It started to ring and someone picked up. Usagi heard the familiar  voice on the other side of the line.</p>
<p>“Moshi moshi?”</p>
<p>“Minako-chan!”</p>
<p>“Oh. Hi Usagi. I was about to call you.”</p>
<p>“Really?!” Usagi still tried to get used to the idea that she was friends with <em>the</em> Aino Minako.</p>
<p>“Yes. But since you beat me to it. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“I’m bored. Everyone is doing other things and I am stuck at home. Mind if I come over for a bit?”</p>
<p>“Hang  on a minute,” the idol was silent for a few seconds and returned on the  line, “Okay I’m back. Get ready and I’ll pick you up in a few minutes.  See you.”</p>
<p>“Hai,” said Usagi as she closed her phone. She jumped  in excitement for she was going to spend the rest of her day with her  idol, Aino Minako!</p>
<p>In less than an hour, a car pulled up in front  of the Tsukino residence. Before Minako could knock on the door, Usagi  came rushing out with a big smile on her face and hugged the idol.  Minako smiled and shook her head, <em>Same silly Usagi. </em></p>
<p>“I  can’t believe I’m in Minako-chan’s car!” said Usagi as she tried to  look outside the window and bumped her head instead. Minako simply  observed the girl and laughed softly. They finally made it to Minako’s  penthouse and made their way up the elevator. As they opened the door,  Usagi jumped inside filled with awe. She barely went to Minako’s place,  or rather, this was indeed her fist time setting foot into it. The  place was very roomy with a simple but somewhat elegant style to it.  Usagi found her way towards the couch and settled in it. Even the  carpet felt nice against her toes.</p>
<p>“Oh Usagi. Here, it’s my  latest album. Just finished it yesterday, and it will be released on  Christmas Day. I hope you like it. Call it an early Christmas present.”</p>
<p>Usagi  looked at the album speechless. She was happy, but at the same time  saddened. Christmas was in three weeks. Last week she was worried about  being late for school, now it seemed like a small issue compared to  what she has to deal with now. Usagi was silent for a moment and Minako  started to worry. Usagi stared at the album and suddenly got up and  exclaimed, “Arigato Minako-chan! I love it so much. I can’t wait to  listen to it!”</p>
<p>Minako looked at her friend, <em>Flawless. As if the tumor doesn’t even exist to her.</em></p>
<p>“How about we do something before meeting up with everyone?” she asked calmly.</p>
<p>Usagi  agreed, and opened the glass doors that lead to the balcony of Minako’s  pent house. She stood outside for a moment. It was quite silence  despite the traffic that circulated below her. <em>Peaceful.</em><em> What will I miss when I…die? Everything. Everyone. Mamoru. </em>Tears began to form from her eyes. <em>Why am I crying? I shouldn’t be, I should be trying to enjoy what’s left of my life. What I have left to live.</em></p>
<p>From inside Minako observed Usagi. Artemis hopped beside the idol.</p>
<p>“Artemis.  Usagi puts on this face to show the world she’s not scared, but deep  inside, she’s hurting as much as we all are. Is this how it felt when  you saw me dying?”</p>
<p>Artemis nodded, “It was how Rei felt whenever  she was around you. Wanting to help, but there was nothing she could  do. You should talk to Usagi. Luna says that she refuses to tell anyone  about her condition. Reminds me of someone.”</p>
<p>Minako sighed, “Hai.”</p>
<p>She  opened the glass doors and stood next to her friend. Usagi looked at  her, and tried to hide the fact that she had been crying. Minako looked  back at Usagi and for the first time since the hospital incident, she  saw the pain that Usagi tried so desperately to hide. “Usagi. We need  to talk,” Minako said calmly.</p>
<p>Usagi nodded in understanding what that meant, “I know.”</p>
<p>Minako  looked at her and said, “My instincts gave me a hint but I was in  denial at first, hoping that it wasn’t true, but here we are. Usagi you  don’t need to keep making it seem like everything is okay. That would  just be lying to yourself.”</p>
<p>From that single moment, Usagi  finally let all her barriers crash. She allowed the tears run down,  “Why me Minako-chan? What did I do? Did I do something wrong?” Minako  hugged the girl and Usagi finally let all the tears fall.</p>
