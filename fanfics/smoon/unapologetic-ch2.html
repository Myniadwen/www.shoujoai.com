- I know you usually take hours in the bathroom, Michiru, but I was 
beginning to wonder if you&#39;d drowned yourself in the tub.

Bare feet on the tiles of the bathroom floor, grey eyes that change 
colour depending on the mood of the holder running over a slim body 
half-hidden in sweet-scented bubbles.

- Even if I tried, I highly doubt the water would allow me to commit 
suicide. It knows me too well.

A gentle laugh, hands untouched by the long stay underwater gripping the 
edges of the bathtub to support a slim body as it rises from the water

- You&#39;ve been quiet tonight. Uneasy about tomorrow?

A deep voice concealing the worry hidden behind the casualness of the 
question and the familiarity of the towel being wrapped around slender 
shoulders.

- No, I&#39;ve... been thinking. I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t live here, Haruka.

Hesitant words, the true meaning not to be found in what has actually 
been said, but what is being held back as fragile hands dry off waving 
locks of teal.

- I agree; it&#39;s a strange country. They make everything much more 
complicated than it ought to be.

Strong arms encircling a thin waist, two soft bodies resting against 
each other as smiling lips nuzzle into still damp hair, teasingly 
pressing a kiss to an earlobe.

- Maa, I wasn&#39;t referring to something as simple as that, Tenoh-san.

Hands leaving wet trails on a black shirt as the smaller woman turns 
around and takes hold of a pair of broad shoulders. A giggle stolen away 
as lips meet and explore.

- I&#39;m terribly sorry! I&#39;ll come back later...

A stammering voice cut off as the door begins to fall shut, hindered by 
a pile of clean towels dropped on the threshold; hurried steps rushing 
over the floor of the living room as the intruder escapes.

- Ara, I guess kissing cousins is not something she walks in on every 
day.

A dry joke uttered in an amused voice, frail fingers unbuttoning her 
short-haired companion&#39;s wet shirt effortlessly.

- Well, as far as I know it&#39;s not exactly illegal...

A small smirk curving kiss-swollen lips as the blush in the tall woman&#39;s 
cheeks subsides, the following silence filled with a soft, reflective 
&#147;hmm&#148; from her lover&#39;s throat and a mirroring, mischievous smirk making 
ocean eyes glow.

A sceptically raised, blonde eyebrow is her partner&#39;s immediate 
reaction.

- Michiru...

Words dying out as one, elegant finger is pressed against a half-open 
mouth

- You&#39;re right, Haruka, it&#39;s not. Now... hush.

A smiling, flirtatious gaze and tenderly persuading hands leading the 
way to the bedroom.

- Yareyare &#150; that was what I feared...

A clear indication of mirth evident in a husky voice as the heap of 
towels is kicked out of the way and the door closes once more, muffling 
the laughter of two girls.</pre>
