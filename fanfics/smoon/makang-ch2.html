<h1>Makoto's Angel (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jwelch.html">Jessica Welch</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makang-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The next day started off terribly for Makoto. She was late. She over
slept and had circles under her eyes due to the fact that roller paint
wallpapered design and rubber broom info-mercials kept her vacant mind
awake until five in the morning. She swore she would never pull
something like that again. Her uniform was wrinkled and her hair was
more mussed than usual in her pony tail. She looked like crap to put it
bluntly. The other students kept their distance from the &quot;karate
maniac&quot; not wanting to see if her mood was as foul as her appearance.

She and Usagi would have detention together because she was late also.
Not as late as her though.. She just wanted to go home, curl into a
ball and sleep. But no she would have to spend thirty minutes after
school and then rush home and bake a snack for the study group at Rei&#39;s
place. By the time that would finish it would be past six and she&#39;d
have to cook dinner for herself. When everything was finished it would
be close to nine. She sat not eating her lunch while thinking of this,
oblivious to everyone else around her. Makoto felt absolutely
miserable.

&quot;Mako-chan are you going to eat tha-OW!...Ami! Whad&#39;ya do that for it
hurt!&quot; Usagi howled rubbing her arm where Ami had pinched her. Ami just
glared at her. Makoto came halfway out of her trance like state and
handed Usagi the rest of her lunch. &quot;Wow, thanks a lot Mako-chan,&quot; she
didn&#39;t waste anytime inhaling what was on the little tray.

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re alright Mako-chan?&quot; Ami asked concerned. Makoto
only nodded. She had explained earlier that she was just tired because
she hadn&#39;t gotten much sleep. &quot;Alright... &quot; Ami still sounded
concerned. This wasn&#39;t like Makoto at all. She would discuss it with
the others later. The bell rang and everyone gathered their things and
headed to their next class.

Makoto couldn&#39;t pay attention in class, it was like she wasn&#39;t even
there. Her thoughts were scattered due mostly to the little amount of
sleep she got. She would get flashes of Minako smiling or laughing but
instead of getting that dreamy gaze, she looked despondent. Had she
been more awake Makoto would have carefully hid her feelings but she
was just way too out of it. The detention came and went with Usagi
trying to pass her notes. She soon gave up after she realized all
Makoto was responding with was a &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot;, or &quot;I don&#39;t
know&quot;.

She didn&#39;t remember the walk home but when she got there she put on
some old jeans and a sweat shirt. She went to the kitchen and
thoughtlessly made a snack, mechanically producing cookies. She hadn&#39;t
really noticed she made them until she started putting them on a plate.
&#39;Whoa I really have to snap out of it before I have an accident. I
really wish I could lay down and fall asleep.&#39; It was time to go again
and she grabbed her books and the cookies and headed out the door to
Rei&#39;s temple.

* * * * *

&quot;I&#39;m really worried about her Rei-chan. This is not like her at all.&quot;
Ami had related the events of today to her dark haired friend. They
were the only ones at the temple so far. Ami was always early and
usually filled Rei in on what happened at her school before everyone
else arrived.

&quot;You&#39;re right, that doesn&#39;t sound like Mako-chan in the least. I can&#39;t
believe meatball head actually took advantage of her state and ate her
lunch... well I can believe it but still!&quot; Rei exclaimed. &quot;So what
should we do? Maybe she just need some sleep.&quot;

&quot;I think its more than that, she seems sad too. Almost heartbroken. I
wonder if it has anything to do with the boy she has a crush on.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know Ami-chan. She usually bounces back so quickly from those
crushes. But I guess it could be that.&quot; Rei&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;And if it
is then we really don&#39;t have much to worry about.&quot;

&quot;Worry about what?&quot; Minako asked as she bounced in.

&quot;Not worrying rather, about Makoto. Didn&#39;t you see her in school
today?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Actually I didn&#39;t. I had a dentist appointment this morning and it ran
over. They wanted pictures and molds of my teeth to use as an example
of a perfect mouth. Can you believe that? It lasted till lunch and
there was no reason to come in for that so I ate out with my mom then
she dropped me off at school. I don&#39;t have any classes with Mako-chan
in the arvo.&quot;

&quot;Arvo?&quot; Ami questioned.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Mina giggled. &quot;There was this little Australian kid there
with the coolest accent. Arvo means afternoon. It&#39;s much easier to say
it that way. Anywho, what about Mako-chan? Did she crush on another guy
already?&quot;

&quot;Ami was telling me she seemed really out of it today,&quot; Rei explained.
&quot;acting depressed and lacking focus.&quot;

&quot;She did say she didn&#39;t get that much sleep last night though so we
concluded that&#39;s what caused her disposition,&quot; Ami clarified for the
worried looking Minako.

Before Minako could inquire further, Makoto came sluggishly through the
door. Her eyes were half closed and the circles under them were a
darker shade of violet. She walked over to the study table and put her
books down. She took the plate of cookies to the kitchen and yawned as
she passed her three friends. She grunted in greeting not really seeing
who was standing in the small group. As she passed through the doors
Rei said under her breath, &quot;She looks like shit.&quot; Minako turned and
glared at her. Before she could say anything Makoto was coming back
into the room. She sat right down on the floor next to the table and
rested her cheek on one of her books. Rei muttered again. &quot;Death warmed
over might be a better way to put it.&quot; Minako shot her another
withering look but Rei ignored it.

&quot;She shouldn&#39;t be here,&quot; Mina said, &quot;she should be at home asleep.&quot;

&quot;You know how loyal she is Mina-chan. She never wants to let us down
and I bet she thought she would if she didn&#39;t show up with some
snacks.&quot; Ami added with some amazement, &quot;I can&#39;t believe she managed to
bake without having an accident.&quot;

Rei whispered back, &quot;Well the kitchen is like second nature to her. I
doubt she could do anything wrong in there even if the Negaverse had
control over her.&quot;

Mina went over to the groggy brunette and touched her shoulder. Makoto
jumped a little and looked up sleepily a dopey smile forming on her
face. &quot;Are you alright Mako-chan?&quot;

She blinked a few times and looked at Minako again. Her smile fell. &#39;I
thought I was seeing my angel again.&#39; She nodded and mumbled something
about being tired again and turned away.

Mina feeling a little hurt got up and went over to Rei and Ami. &quot;She
shouldn&#39;t be here, I&#39;m going to take her home and make her sleep. Maybe
then we can get some answers.&quot; Ami and Rei both nodded in agreement.
Minako knelt in front of Makoto and took her hands. &quot;Upsidaisy bakka
head. You know you shouldn&#39;t have come today. I&#39;m going to take you
home.&quot;

Makoto resisted, &quot;But I have to study and I had to bring the snacks.
Everyone was counting on me to bring them.&quot;

Mina pulled Makoto to her feet, &quot;You know we would have understood, now
just be quiet and do as your told. We&#39;re all worried about you. We&#39;ll
leave the treats here for Usagi and I&#39;ll stay over tonight incase you
wake up and want to study. So there is no argument, got it?&quot;

Makoto was actually too tired to argue more. The thought of her warm
bed was calling her. She reached down for her books but Mina swatted
her hands away. &quot;I&#39;ll carry them,&quot; she said, &quot;You look like you can
barely walk.&quot; Makoto pulled her shoulders back and stood as straight as
she could. She was tuff and strong, not an invalid. Her efforts just
highlighted what bad shape she was in, and took the last of her energy.
She didn&#39;t have the strength to argue with Mina.

When Mina had all their things she told the other&#39;s not to worry.
Grabbing Makoto&#39;s hand she led her out of the temple and started down
the steps. Usagi was on her way up them, late as usual. &quot;Hey where are
you two going? Does this mean there aren&#39;t any treats? Gosh Mako-chan
you look like hell.&quot;

Mina rolled her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m taking her home. She needs some rest. And
yes there are treats so you better hurry and get in there before Rei
and Ami decide they&#39;re more entitled than you to Mako-chan&#39;s and my
share.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to deal with Usagi, and that last comment sent
her running.

Minako carefully lead Makoto down the steps, wondering how she ever
made it up them on her own. The entire walk proceeded in silence, save
for the constant scraping of Makoto&#39;s shoes against the pavement. Mina
still held her hand guiding her through people and street lamps.
Finally they made it to Makoto&#39;s place. &quot;Can I have your key
Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto reached into her pocket and took it out. Her hand felt all warm
and tingly from holding Minako&#39;s. It felt so nice. She day dreamed for
the entire trip, thinking of how great it would be to walk hand in hand
with Mina everyday. She loved the way her hair shone in the sun. The
way her eyes sparkled when she laughed, and of course she was always
laughing. The way a room lit up when she smiled. &#39;Yeah I could
definitely get used to this, I wish I wasn&#39;t dreaming.&#39; She smiled and
handed Mina the key.

Minako opened the door and walked in putting their books down. Makoto
was still in the door way with a dreamy look on her face again. &quot;Well
at least it&#39;s an improvement.&quot; She went back and grabbed the taller
girl&#39;s hand, &quot;Come on dream girl, lets tuck you in.&quot; She led Makoto to
her room and made her sit on the bed. Kneeling she untied her friends
shoes and took them off. &quot;Ok now lay down.&quot;

Makoto did as she was told, lost in her thoughts. &#39;I&#39;m her dream girl.
This is great. I don&#39;t ever want to wake up.&#39; She let out a soft sigh
and looked up at her angel. &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful Mina-chan,&quot; she
whispered closing her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m so lucky to have you, even if it is
just in my dreams...&quot; and with that she drifted off into real sleep.

* * * * *

Makoto woke up almost five hours later. It was near nine o&#39;clock and
her stomach was making its presence known. &#39;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve eaten
anything since last night.&#39; She yawned and stretched looking around. &#39;I
wonder how I got here, last thing I remember was getting ready to bake
cookies for the study group.&#39; Her tummy growled again. &quot;All right I&#39;ll
feed you, hush.&quot; She got up and started making her way to the kitchen.
&#39;Lets see, I remember having this wonderful dream with Mina-chan in it,
she was a beautiful angel and we walked together hand in hand. And then
I was in bed and I told her she was beautiful and I was falling asleep
when I felt the lightest brush of her lips against my forehead. I wish
I remembered more. What a great dream.&#39; She opened the fridge and
rummaged around for a moment.

&quot;Ah so the sleepy head is finally awake I see. Did you have a nice
nap?&quot; Makoto jumped and hit her head on the freezer&#39;s bottom. &quot;Pretty
slick there champ,&quot; Mina laughed. &quot;Are you ok?&quot;

Standing up and turning towards her Makoto rubber her head and
stuttered. &quot;I... er... yeah... fine... what are you doing here?&quot; she
finally managed to get out with a confused look.

&quot;Making sure you&#39;re ok baka head. You know how worried everyone has
been about you today. Walking around like a zombie, not speaking, not
eating,&quot; on cue Makoto&#39;s stomach growled loudly. &quot;Here you go sit down
and I&#39;m make you something to eat. I already had a sandwich so before
you start to protest, don&#39;t. Now go and relax.&quot; Minako practically
pushed her into the living room before she had a chance to argue.

Sitting on the couch Makoto tried to sort things out in her head.
&#39;Maybe that wasn&#39;t a dream. Mina-chan must have walked me home and put
me to bed. I wonder how much of it were a dream and how much of it was
real. I remember calling her beautiful... did I really say that to her
though or did I dream it. Oh please let me have dreamt it.&#39; She sat
stiffly waiting for Mina to return wondering what questions she would
ask and how she would explain herself.

Minako walked in with a plate and a glass of juice. &quot;Now I&#39;m not the
great chef that you are but I can make a mean tuna fish sandwich. So
enjoy.&quot; She set the meal in front of Makoto.

She was almost too nervous to eat, almost. Her tummy rumbled again when
she hesitated and her nervousness was replaced by a severe hunger. She
inhaled the two sandwiches faster than Usagi had ever inhaled anything.
&#39;I guess that&#39;s what happens when you don&#39;t eat for 24 hours or more.&#39;
Makoto sat back and drank her juice, she was already feeling better.
&quot;Thank you very much Mina-chan. You didn&#39;t have to do all this but I
appreciate it. I&#39;m feeling much better now.&quot;

&quot;It was no trouble,&quot; Mina replied. &quot;and I&#39;m very glad you&#39;re feeling
better. All of us were very worried about you.&quot; She sat down on the
couch beside her friend. &quot;Now why don&#39;t you tell me what&#39;s bugging
you.&quot;

Makoto was all tense. &#39;Oh what should I do. I hate lying to her but how
is she going to understand. I can&#39;t just say &quot;Hey Mina-chan you know
I&#39;m a lesbian and I like you as more than a friend. Yeah I think you&#39;re
pretty hot!&quot; Of course I can&#39;t do that. Though she is so gorgeous.&#39; She
looked over at the blonde. &#39;She does look like an angel though, so
perfect. Maybe I should just tell her and get it over with. Then no
matter what the answer was I would get over this anxiety every time I
was near her. Yeah, screw it, I&#39;ll just tell her how I feel.&#39; She took
a deep breath, &quot;Nothing is bugging me Mako-chan. I&#39;m fine, just up too
late last night.&quot; She looked down at her hands. &#39;Oh nice. Way to have
courage baka head. That&#39;s really telling it like it is.&#39;

&quot;Ok Mako-chan if you don&#39;t want to tell me right now I understand. You
had a rough day today, and you&#39;re all tensed up. But I know just the
thing to fix that.&quot; Minako reach over and put her finger under Makoto&#39;s
chin and gently tilted her face up so she could look her in the eye.
&quot;But you have to trust me. Do you trust me?&quot;

Makoto was trapped by her eyes, slowly drowning in their blue depths.
&quot;Of course I trust you Mina-chan, with all my heart,&quot; she whispered
softly.

&quot;All right then, you have to do exactly what I tell you. No questions
asked. No arguments. Is that understood?&quot; Makoto nodded. &quot;Good,&quot; Minako
grabbed her hand again and led her back to the bedroom. &quot;Now, remember
you trust me. No questions and no arguments. And remember this is just
your old friend Mina. I&#39;m not going to bite you or hurt you.&quot;

Getting a little suspicious Makoto asked, &quot;Now what are you going to do
to me that would make me think that?&quot;

&quot;I said no questions. You just have to trust me. Now are you sure
you&#39;re going to cooperate?&quot; Makoto sighed and nodded. &quot;Alright then.
Mako-chan you&#39;ll have to take your shirt off please.&quot;

Makoto eyes were huge. &quot;What!&quot;

Mina started chuckling at her expression. &quot;Oh come on Mako-chan. You
said you trusted me. Now don&#39;t be shy. I promise you&#39;ll love what I&#39;m
going to do.&quot; Mako relented and turned around. She pulled her
sweatshirt over her head and tossed it on the ground. &quot;And your bra
too. I promise I won&#39;t peek. When you have that off just lay face down
on the bed.&quot; As she said this she turned off the lights and lit a
candle that was on Makoto&#39;s dresser.

Makoto laid down on the bed severely blushing trying to remember how to
breathe. &#39;What the hell is she planning on doing? I&#39;m half naked for
crying out loud.&#39; She felt Mina crawl onto the bed beside her. &#39;Oh this
has to be the worst form of torture there is. I&#39;m half naked and she&#39;s
beside me in my bed in my room and I can&#39;t even say anything or do
anything.&#39;

Minako spoke softly. &quot;One problem you have is that you are way to
tense. I&#39;m going to fix that. Now try to relax and just listen to my
voice. I&#39;m going to give you a massage.&quot;

&#39;No, there is a worse form of torture, and I&#39;m about to experience it.&#39;
Makoto shut her eyes tight. &#39;Just don&#39;t think of anything. Don&#39;t think
of how softer her hands feel, her smooth skin, her beautiful eyes,
perfect lips, her-NO. Don&#39;t think. Keep your mind blank. You can get
through this.&#39;

Minako placed her warms hands at the base of Makoto&#39;s neck and made
gentle but deep circles with her thumbs working out the knot of muscle.
She started speaking in a low soothing voice as if talking to a
skittish horse trying to calm it. &quot;You have a very remarkable back.
It&#39;s well muscled yet it&#39;s not bulky or hard.&quot; She moved her hands
across her shoulder blades and made large circles with the heal of her
hand. &quot;Supple, that&#39;s how to describe it best, now let out that breath
you&#39;re holding and relax. Think of a warm beach with soft sand and
clear blue water.&quot; Her fingers began kneading the tops of Makoto&#39;s
shoulders.

Makoto let out the breath in a sigh. Minako voice was like soft music.
She felt herself begin to relax and enjoy her touch without
apprehension. &#39;It&#39;s just a massage, nothing more.&#39; She felt herself
sinking into the mattress becoming boneless through Minako&#39;s heavenly
ministrations. Her friends hands found every place of tension in her
back and magically made it disappear. Her touch was so soft and gentle
like they were handling something extremely precious. It had an amazing
affect making Makoto feel as if she was floating. Her thoughts started
to drift as she became sleepy again. &#39;I could die now and be the
happiest I&#39;ve ever been in my life.&#39; She gradually dozed off under
Mina&#39;s tender care, imagining the soft caress of her lips against her
cheek as delicate as an angel&#39;s breath.
