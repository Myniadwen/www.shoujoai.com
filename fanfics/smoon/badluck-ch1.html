<h1>Bad Luck Kitchen Charm</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/forensic.html">Forensic Ninja</a><br> </h2>
Warnings: At one point, this switches from a sort of Haruka POV to a more Michiru POV, but I don’t think it’s too noticeable. Besides, the point is that there’s sex, right?
<BR><BR>
Haruka watched as her lover hummed and sang softly in the kitchen, preparing a private dinner for just the two of them. Hotaru was sleeping over at Chibiusa’s and Setsuna was over at Ami’s, working on some sort of astronomy computer programme. For tonight, it was just Haruka and Michiru.
<BR><BR><i>Just like old times,</i> Haruka thought. <i>No kids, no computer geeks, just me and Michiru, all alone in a big apartment…</i>*
<BR><BR>Michiru moved to turn around and Haruka darted quickly behind the door. If Michiru saw her, she’d chase her out of the kitchen, because whenever Haruka was near any form of cooking, it invariably went wrong, which mystified Haruka to no end. Did she have some sort of aura of bad cooking?
<BR><BR><i>It’s a good thing I’m a lesbian,</i> Haruka thought wryly, <i>because I’d make a horrible wife to a man.</i> Life before Michiru had been an endless stream of instant ramen interrupted by the occasional girlfriend.
<BR><BR>Once she heard Michiru stirring a wooden spoon in the pot, Haruka moved silently back into place, watching Michiru’s slow, sure movements with the food and utensils.
<BR><BR><i>She’s so damn sexy when she’s focused like that. Especially in that dress she has on,</i> Haruka thought, feeling the stirrings of something deep within her at the sight of her lover at the stove. <i>I bet she doesn’t even know I’m here. I could sneak up behind her and she’d never notice.</i>
<BR><BR>Silent as a breeze in the spring, Haruka crept up behind the unaware Michiru. She stood, waiting until the shorter woman put the spoon aside and covered the pot with a lid. Haruka grabbed her from behind, wrapping one arm around her breasts and the other around her mouth.
<BR><BR>“I have you now, my pretty,” Haruka whispered into her ear. She gave the lobe a quick lick before releasing Michiru’s mouth.
<BR><BR>“Haruka!” Michiru exclaimed. “I thought you were in the garage with your car!”
<BR><BR>“You’re much more interesting than the Hyperion**,” Haruka said, squeezing the breast her hand rested on. Her other hand trailed down to rest right between Michiru’s legs. “Especially this part of you.”
<BR><BR>“Haruka,” Michiru said breathlessly as the taller woman squeezed both hands. “Haruka, I have to…the dinner…”
<BR><BR>“We can have soup and salad later,” Haruka told her, spinning around and pushing Michiru against the ceramic island. “Right now, I want <i>you</i>.”
<BR><BR>Haruka’s right hand found the end of Michiru’s short, breezy skirt and lifted it up, trapping it between Michiru and the counter. Her fingers explored Michiru’s thighs, skirting around the edges of her underwear, teasingly sliding underneath every once in a while. Michiru’s breathing quickened as she grasped at the ceramic tile.
<BR><BR>Suddenly, Haruka’s fingers plunged up, leaving only thin, damp cloth between them and Michiru.
<BR><BR>“Wet already?” she smirked. “Is this for me, or does everyone who accost you get such a…<i>warm</i> greeting?” Haruka squeezed Michiru’s breast for emphasis, causing the usually calm woman to squeak.
<BR><BR>As her right hand pressed rhythmically against Michiru’s centre, Haruka’s left began to dip inside Michiru’s dress, pulling the sleeveless straps down with her teeth. She pinched at a nipple for a few minutes as she nipped and licked at Michiru’s neck before pushing the top down, leaving Michiru’s breasts completely exposed to the warm kitchen air. Abruptly, Haruka removed both of her hands. After a few seconds, Michiru tried to twist her torso around to see what was wrong.
<BR><BR>“Haruka, wh- <i>Haruka!</i>”
<BR><BR>Haruka grabbed her lover by the upper thighs and lifted her onto the counter just enough so that her hips rested on the rounded edge. She pushed down on her back down so that Michiru’s breasts were pressed full flushed against the counter top. Michiru gasped as her nipples reacted to the cool tile surface.
<BR><BR>“Off with these,” Haruka muttered, removing Michiru’s underwear and tossing them behind her. She pressed up against Michiru’s naked back as her hands spread Michiru’s legs and pushed them up on the counter, forcing Michiru forward. The violinist moaned at the feel of her heated body behind pushed against the chilly surface of the counter further.
<BR><BR>“There you are,” she heard Haruka say behind her. “One of my favourite parts of Michiru.” A hand slipped forward, playing with the sea-green hair and twisting in the wiry strands. The other grasped the hem of her skirt and pulled it up to rest on her lower back.
<BR><BR>“All spread out, just for me,” Haruka murmured as her fingers pried opened her dripping lips, revealing Michiru’s wet, hot centre. Michiru felt her body grow even more heated.
<BR><BR>“All for me. Not even our beloved princess gets to see you like this.”
<BR><BR>Michiru let out a scream as Haruka pressed her tongue up against her opening, pressing it in with light, shallow dips. Haruka rolled and undulated her tongue inside Michiru, occasionally moving up to tease her clit with slow, deep strokes before returning. Michiru grasped at the smooth tile, trying in vain to dip her fingers in.
<BR><BR>Her hips bucked as Haruka finally shoved her tongue in as far as possible, holding Michiru’s ankles wide apart on the counter as she filled her lover over and over against. Michiru’s tried to move with Haruka until they were stilled by a hand holding her hips still against the onslaught.
<BR><BR>Michiru panted, banging a hand against the tile, her other hand pulling at her nipples and tickling her breasts. The heat twist inside her, coiling and uncoiling faster and faster as Michiru came closer and closer to orgasm. But just as her toes began to curl Haruka pulled away.
<BR><BR>“Ah! Ah…Haruka! Haruka, why did you stop?!” she demanded, trying to twist around again. Haruka rested her body against Michiru’s back, her loose shirt rubbing against Michiru in a way that drove her mad.
<BR><BR>“I haven’t stopped,” Haruka expained through breaths. “I’m just doing <i>this</i>.”
<BR><BR>Haruka drove two fingers deep into Michiru, causing the woman to buck up and curled her back. Haruka pushed her dress up further, biting and licking Michiru’s lower back. The woman screamed and pushed back, trying to force Haruka to go faster. She felt Haruka grin against her back and comply, pulling out momentarily to push three fingers inside.
<BR><BR>The two women panted together. Michiru could feel her lover’s breath against her back, wanted to feel all of her, next to her and in her and around her-
<BR><BR>“If we had some lube,” Haruka was saying, “If we had some sort of oil, I’d shove my hand all the way in you and stay there forever, shove all the way in and never leave. Never be apart. Never again.”
<BR><BR>Haruka stood up but continuing pounding inside, and Michiru felt a hand leave her hips. A rustling could be heard behind her, and Haruka suddenly pressed closer against Michiru and the counter. The mere thought that Haruka might be playing with her own clit with one hand just as she was fucking Michiru with the other made the warm coil inside Michiru twist even more. Her breaths became even quicker, panting as if trying they couldn’t get out of her mouth fast enough.
<BR><BR>“Ah! Ah…ah…aaaahhhhhh<i>Harukaaaaaaa!</i>” Michiru shouted, her body tightening around Haruka’s fingers even as her lover continued to thrust into her. “<i>Haaaaa!</i>”
<BR><BR>Michiru slumped against the counter, feeling Haruka’s fingers still moving against her spasming muscles. The hypersensitivity of her nerve-endings caused Michiru to moan as Haruka shouted and her fingers twitched inside. Haruka fell across Michiru’s back, panting along with her lover as the fingers on both her hands slowly ceased movement.
<BR><BR>After a few minutes, Haruka gently removed her hands from Michiru and her own pants, and slid down the counter to rest haphazardly on the floor. Michiru gently moved from the counter as well and lay down against her lover.
<BR><BR>“The ocean…was quite turbulent, just now,” she said as she snuggled against her lover’s heaving breasts.
<BR><BR>“Funny you should…mention turbulence,” Haruka panted. “The wind, just now…”
<BR><BR>“Mm.” Michiru snuggled further into the taller woman, feeling Haruka’s hand run gently up and down her side. “That was wonderful, Haruka.”
<BR><BR>“You certainly seemed to be enjoying yourself,” Haruka said with a smirk. She dropped a light kiss atop her lover’s sweaty, untidy head. She tried moved back but Michiru pulled her closer, kissing her face. They spent minutes sitting on the kitchen floor, nuzzling and kissing, hands roaming across and under clothing in a soft, intimate manner.
<BR><BR>A sharp smell, however, cut sharply into the air, ruining their cuddle and causing Haruka to make a face.
<BR><BR>“Ugh,” the racer said emphatically. “Smells like…like…”
<BR><BR>“It smells like something’s burning!” Michiru shrieked, dashing up and to the stove. “Oh, no! <i>Haruka!</i>”
<BR><BR>“What? What’d I do?” Haruka asked, standing up and buttoning up her jeans.
<BR><BR>“You…ooh…” Michiru grabbed two pot holders and carried the smoking pot to the sink. “This is exactly why I tell you to stay out of the kitchen while I’m working! You’re…you’re…you’re a bad luck kitchen charm!” she cried, dumping the ruined soup down the drain.
<BR><BR>“Whoops,” Haruka said, grinning. “Sorry about that. I didn’t ruin the salad though, right?”
<BR><BR>“I won’t give you a chance to do so. Out! Out of the kitchen!” Michiru demanded, ushering Haruka out with her spoon.
<BR><BR>Haruka laughed, stooping down as she darted out of the room. She stuck her head in to dangle Michiru’s still-damp panties, ducking out of the way as Michiru shut the door.
<BR><BR>“At least I’m a sexy bad luck kitchen charm,” Haruka said.
<BR><BR>
*I never quite understood why they had a separate apartment in the manga (and the anime?), except that maybe they’d get in trouble with the school if they lived together. But they probably hung out in each other’s apartments most of the time.
<BR>**In the manga, Haruka drives a metallic blue “Azurro Hyperion.”
