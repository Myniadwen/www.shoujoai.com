<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 20 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><p><u>(Neptune Shuttle, The Bridge)</u></p><p>Sometime later, Haruka had requested for all 
of the planet leaders to meet in the bridge of Neptune’s head transport ship. However, after 
everyone had shown up, only four of the six available seats were occupied. The 
representatives of Venus and Mars were absent. No one had expected the Venusian diplomat to 
show up, but they couldn’t very well start the briefing without Mars. It was this awkward 
wait that was making them all anxious. Secretly, although no one would openly admit it, 
Minako’s ordeal had dragged up a few unpleasant memories from their own pasts.</p><p>In the 
outside hallway, Taya and Sapphro approached the lift to the bridge.</p><p>“Are you sure?” 
Sapphro whispered to her.</p><p>“We’ve already been through this. I’m sure,” Taya said 
firmly. “Someone has to act as Venus’s representative while our Lady is 
recuperating.”</p><p>“That...won’t be necessary.”</p><p>Both guardians looked up at the pair 
across from them.</p><p>Minutes later, the bridge doors parted. Everyone turned to look to 
see two familiar figures step inside. For a moment, they were all taken aback.</p><p>Haruka 
shot Rei an annoyed look. “It’s about time you got here. You’re late, you know? And 
<i>you,</i> I thought you were going to stay home and rest.”</p><p>Minako smiled back. 
“Sorry to disappoint... but I changed my mind. I hope you don’t mind.”</p><p>Haruka stared 
at the smaller woman for a moment. Although her physical appearance hadn’t changed, the 
difference in Minako’s power from before was profound. Undoubtedly, she was a 
Goddess.</p><p>“What about those two watchdogs of yours? Don’t you think they’d be a little 
upset if you suddenly disappeared on them?”</p><p>“It’s already taken care of. We ran into 
them on the way here,” she explained. “They’re going to stay behind and make sure everything 
runs smoothly while I’m away.”</p><p>“Is that so...?” Haruka said thoughtfully. “Well then, 
I guess that’s that. Take a seat. We’ll begin immediately.”</p><p>Minako felt almost giddy 
as she took a seat beside Michiru. Everyone was smiling at her, and whispering how good it 
was to have her back. This was much better than lying in that room, doing 
nothing.</p><p>“Ahem.” Haruka cleared her throat. “I really hate to be a party pooper, so! 
Instead, I’ll let Ami tell you all what’s happening.”</p><p>The addressed party sighed. As 
she shuffled the stack of papers in front of her, she muttered under her breath ‘you know I 
was going to do it anyway’. “Umm...so yes, as Haruka has just mentioned, we’re actually in a 
bit of a sticky situation.” The woman opened up a computer screen on the desk and brought up 
a few images onto the overhead projector. “As most of you are already aware of, we barely 
escaped a dangerous, but unpredictable near miss earlier today.”</p><p>“Wait a minute. Is 
that...Hotaru?” Minako squinted at the screen. One of the windows opened up to the side with 
a zoomed up photo of the figure surrounded by the ball of light.</p><p>“...Yeah.” Haruka 
reluctantly admitted. “It is.”</p><p>“But, what happened to her? When did all of this 
happen?”</p><p>“You were unconscious when it happened.” Rei said in a low voice. The comment 
drew a puzzled look from the blonde, but Ami interrupted before she could pursue 
it.</p><p>“Anyway, the cause as to why she suddenly reacted is unknown. To be honest, I 
never knew she had that kind of power lying dormant within her.”</p><p>The comment drew a 
few curious gazes towards Haruka and Michiru, who both seemed somewhat tense at the 
implication.</p><p>“None of us did.” Michiru finally replied. “But as half of the key, we 
now know why it is especially important that she should not fall into the wrong 
hands.”</p><p>“Which is precisely why we have to get her back,” Haruka said 
firmly.</p><p>“No one is disagreeing with you, Haruka,” Makoto said. “The question is...how? 
You saw what happened. Hotaru was taken away by someone even more powerful than herself. How 
are we supposed to fight against something like that?”</p><p>“We’ll find a way...” The wind 
ruler vowed. “By the way, Michiru, did you have any luck with finding the Witch’s 
location?”</p><p><i>The Witch... </i>The title sounded familiar to Minako. <i>Wait a second. 
Wasn’t that what they were talking about back on Neptune? Is this Witch person the same 
person who stole Hotaru away?</i></p><p>“Surprisingly...yes.”</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>“I 
wouldn’t get carried away just yet,” the calm woman warned. “As you know, Haruka, I’ve tried 
to locate her once before and failed. Not only that, but as we can see from Ami’s video, she 
was strong enough to overpower Hotaru. Given that, I think we cannot attribute my success to 
skill or mere coincidence.”</p><p>“She wants us to find her.” Minako spoke 
up.</p><p>“...Precisely.”</p><p>There was another awkward silence.</p><p>“So what...?” 
Haruka finally said. “If she wants a fight, then she’ll get one. We aren’t going to let 
Hotaru go without a fight! Right?!” She looked to her friends.</p><p>“Heh. You’re being an 
over-confident, hot-head as usual,” Rei retorted. “Why don’t you try thinking up of a plan 
first before you get us all killed.”</p><p>“What?! Jeez, that’s so mean...” Her reaction 
brought everyone to laugh, breaking the tense atmosphere. “But fine. I’ll definitely work on 
it. Where are we heading anyways?”</p><p>“Pluto.” Michiru calmly 
said.</p><p><i>Pluto...?</i> Everyone seemed to ponder on that for a moment.</p><p>“Hey, I 
don’t want to be the one to ask a stupid question but... what is Pluto? Is that even a 
planet?” Makoto asked.</p><p>“Hmm...Actually, now that you mention it, I think I heard that 
its planet classification was up to debate.” Ami quipped.</p><p>“...Really? That sounds 
kinda strange. Well, are there any people on it?”</p><p>“I’m not sure. It’s pretty far out, 
so if there are any, it must be pretty isolated.”</p><p>“Like... how far out?” Rei raised an 
eyebrow.</p><p>“Let’s just say... it’s a ways past Neptune.” Michiru could almost smirk at 
the shocked looks she was receiving.</p><p>“Wow.” Minako breathed. <i>That’s pretty 
far...</i></p><p>“So basically, it’s a long trip.” Haruka smiled. “Enough time to come up 
with a plan, right?” She nodded to Rei.</p><p>“If you say so,” The Martian shrugged. “In any 
case, if it’s that far away, then shouldn’t we get started? The longer we sit around, the 
longer it’ll take us to get to Hotaru.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re right. Okay group! I would 
recommend that everyone check up with their soldiers and make sure everything is in order 
before we leave. I would like us all to depart within the 
hour.”</p><p>“Right!!”</p><p>Everyone gathered their things and made their way out of the 
bridge, until only Rei, Minako and Haruka were left. The moment the three were alone, Haruka 
dropped the smiley facade.</p><p>“So, umm, Minako... you’re really, really sure about this? 
Even after hearing all of that?” She asked her again.</p><p>“...Yeah.” She nodded. “Hotaru 
is my friend too. I want to help out in any way I can.”</p><p>“It’ll be dangerous.”</p><p>“I 
know. I did think about it before I agreed to coming.”</p><p>“Well, all right,” Haruka 
patted her shoulder. “But make sure to let your babysitters know about it first! 
Haha!”</p><p>“Hey! They aren’t like that!” Minako indignantly huffed as she watched the 
taller blonde leave the room. “Really!” She said to Rei.</p><p>“...They’re just worried 
about you.”</p><p>“Ah. Yeah, I know. But 
still...”</p><p>“Minako.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p><i>About yesterday...</i> “...Never 
mind.”</p><p>“Eh?! Oh come on! What were you about to say?” She reached out and grabbed 
Rei’s arm. “You don’t think I should stay here too, do you?”</p><p>For once, Rei had to 
think about that. Minako had said it so casually, but she somehow felt like it was a very 
serious question.</p><p>“Hmm...After all of the trouble we went through to find you, it 
would be a waste if you did.” She felt Minako let go of her arm and tilt her head at her 
quizzically. “What’s with that face? You can take care of yourself. It’s your 
choice.”</p><p>The Martian almost had a heart attack when Minako suddenly tackle hugged her, 
laughing. “AWWW~!! Did I ever tell you how much I love you, Rei-bear?”</p><p>“D-Don’t call 
me that! What if someone hears?”</p><p>Minako’s perked up at that. “Is that what you’re 
worried about? Soooo...does that mean I can call you that if no one is 
around?”</p><p>“...Whatever. It’s just a name.” The Martian huffed. Noticing that she was 
letting Minako hug her a little too long, she stepped away and began to make her way towards 
the steps up to the door. “Anyway, you heard Haruka. If you’re coming along, you better get 
ready and quick. We’ll be leaving within the hour.” She stopped in front of the door, 
noticing that Minako had suddenly gone silent. The Venusian hadn’t moved from that spot 
since she pulled out of the hug; did she do something wrong. “Umm...Minako?”</p><p>“Right! 
Yeah, I heard...Umm... But, I was wondering...” She saw Rei arched an eyebrow. “Could I 
catch a ride with you?”</p><p><u>(Martian Shuttle, Rei’s room)</u></p><p>Despite some minor 
setbacks, everyone had departed on schedule. The fleet had set a direct course for 
Pluto.</p><p>Rei found herself sitting her in room and was quickly becoming restless. She 
sighed to herself. Being on standby was terribly boring; while everyone was off doing who 
knows what, she had nothing to do. Normally she would sleep during these long trips, but her 
bunk was currently being occupied by someone else. She found herself staring at the 
reflection off of the glass. Off to the side she could see that Minako was peacefully 
snuggled into her bed.</p><p><i>Hmph. So much for not being tired... </i>Rei absent-mindedly 
thought. <i>But I guess I can’t blame her. She did just lose her entire family after all. 
</i>She allowed her gaze to linger for a moment longer. Minako’s back was turned towards 
her. What had happened during their last private encounter still bothered her.</p><p><i>She 
really doesn’t remembering anything, does she?</i></p><p>“<i>Wow, just look at you. You’re 
all beaten up. What happened?”</i></p><p>“<i>Oh. I see... Well, you know, these things just 
happen sometimes, I guess...” </i></p><p>“You know...You really suck at pretending to be 
asleep.”</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>“Well, now I do.” Rei could imagine the Venusian 
pouting as she said that. “And you know, you sigh a lot.” She shot back.</p><p>“Is that 
so?”</p><p>“Mhmm...” Knowing that she had been found out, the blonde stretched languidly 
under the sheets and made a noise of contentment as she readjusted into a more comfortable 
position. “So...? A penny for your thoughts...?”</p><p>“...It’s nothing 
important.”</p><p>“Uh huh... Sure. No, really. What were you thinking 
about?”</p><p>“Stuff.”</p><p>“...Like?”</p><p>“Just stuff.”</p><p>Minako rolled her eyes and 
shifted on the bed to get a better look at the Martian. For a minute she stared at her in 
silence. “...I just don’t understand you.” This sudden confession caught Rei’s immediate 
attention. “Why did you come all this way to save me if you were only going to ignore me? 
And don’t even try to deny it. I <i>know </i>you were the one who saved me.”</p><p>“W-What 
are you talking about?” Rei was beginning to panic. <i>Oh no, don’t tell me she actually 
remembers that!</i></p><p>“Taya told me. She said you found me unconscious, and that you 
brought me back.”</p><p>“Oh.” Somehow, that was more disappointing than Rei had expected it 
to be. “I see...”</p><p>“So...? Why did you do it? Honestly.”</p><p>Rei opened her mouth and 
then closed it again. She had considered telling the blonde that it was a part of their 
contract that they made back on Mars, that it was her duty to protect her, but that was 
until she had used ‘that’ word.</p><p>“...Honestly? It’s because we’re friends...and it’s 
what friends do, right?”</p><p>Minako was stunned by what she heard. <i>Friends...? You 
mean, she did it because she...</i> It wasn’t quite the answer she had hoped to hear, but it 
did bring a smile to her face nevertheless.</p><p>“Is that so? You know... I haven’t told 
anyone else about this yet, but there’s this gap in my memory.”</p><p>“A gap? What do you 
mean?”</p><p>“Well, one minute, I remember seeing my mother dying...and then the next there 
was this bright flash of light. After that, it’s all a blank. I just remember coming to in 
that room and you were all there.” She waited to see if Rei would say anything, but when she 
didn’t she decided to try and be a little more direct. “You found me, didn’t you? Did 
you...see what happened to me?”</p><p>“I...” Rei realized her mistake and bit her 
lip.</p><p>“What did you see?”</p><p>“...Nothing.”</p><p>“But--”</p><p>“Look. The important 
thing is that you’re safe now, right?”</p><p>Minako couldn’t understand why Rei was dodging 
the subject, but it did make her feel a little better to hear that she had been concerned 
about her well being.</p><p>“Oh. I almost forgot.” Rei said suddenly.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“You 
mentioned that you had a brother, right...?”</p><p>“Yeah. Eros.”</p><p>“Is that... a 
nickname or something?”</p><p>“...Yeah. Why?”</p><p>“Because...I think I met him on the 
battlefield.” She saw the woman suddenly sit up. “By the time I got there though, it was 
already too late. He was almost gone when I found him. But...I just remembered. There was 
something that he wanted me to tell you.”</p><p>“...I’m listening...”</p><p>Rei took a 
breath. “He said that he already knew about what happened on Uranus...but, that it didn’t 
matter.”</p><p>“<i>Please save her.</i>”</p><p>“He thought about you till the very end.” She 
finished.</p><p><i>Eros...</i> Minako felt her heart ache. <i>Even when you were dying, you 
were...</i></p><p>“I-I see... Yeah. That’s just like him,” Minako laughed and sniffed. She 
thought she had gotten over it by now, but it still stung. “He...He didn’t die alone, 
right?”</p><p>“No. He didn’t die alone...”</p><p>“Thank Goddess...” Minako quickly wiped the 
away tears and shook her head at Rei’s inquiring gaze. “It’s okay. I’m all right. It’s 
just... thanks, Rei. I’m really glad that you told me that.”</p><p>Rei awkwardly looked 
away. She didn’t mean to make the woman cry again, but there was still something weighing 
heavily on her mind.</p><p>“Hey. There was also something else that I was thinking about. Do 
you remember what happened on Neptune?” She heard Minako quiet down. The atmosphere between 
them was very awkward again. “I--I didn’t mean to slap you. You just surprised me, that’s 
all.” Rei’s face was bright red now. “So I, I was just wondering... what was that all about? 
Is it some kind of weird Venusian custom or something?”</p><p>Minako blinked several times 
at her, before her eyes finally softened in understanding. Rei was surprised when the blonde 
stepped off of the bed and walked up to her. She turned around to see what was going on when 
she suddenly felt two hands resting lightly on her shoulders. Minako only hesitated for a 
second; before Rei could do anything, she bent down and gave her a peck on the 
cheek.</p><p>“Yup, you’re right. It is a Venusian custom,” Minako tapped her nose and 
beamed. “It’s a Venusian custom just... for... you.”</p><p>The Martian stared back at her 
with an ‘I don’t get it’ look that brought the Venusian to giggle.</p><p>“I wouldn’t worry 
about it too much. Anyway, I think I really will get some sleep. We still have a ways to go, 
right?”</p><p>Minako didn’t even bother waiting for an answer before she jumped back into 
the bed and snuggled into the sheets. This time, she really did go to sleep and left Rei 
even more confused than ever before.</p><p><i>...I don’t get it. </i>Rei thought to herself. 
<i>If it’s a custom, then why did she do it differently this time?</i></p><p><u>(Martian 
Shuttle, Rei’s room. Sometime later)</u></p><p>Sometime later, Rei had fallen asleep by the 
window. But her rest wasn’t as peaceful as her companion’s-- in her dreams, she found 
herself back on Mars. It was in her younger days while she had been living on the streets. 
She was sitting at the table in the same shady hideout they had found Nozomi. It was 
strangely quiet.</p><p>“<i>They’re really not coming back, are they...?” </i></p><p>The 
scene then changed, and suddenly she was looking into flames. Neptunalia; the moment she 
witnessed the Goddess of Neptune’s demise. She felt an old wound from back then rip back 
open.</p><p>“<b>...It’s a shame, isn’t it?”</b></p><p><i>Huh?!</i> She glimpsed the 
silhouette of a woman with long hair hidden in the shadows.</p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>Rei 
awoke on the alert. But as tempting as it was, she resisted opening her physical eyes and 
instead peered through her spiritual sight. She whipped her sight around the room and, to 
her bewilderment, she found no unusual signatures.</p><p><i>They’re not in here? Then--!! 
Are they outside?!</i></p><p>The Martian expanded her range and began to search outside the 
ship when she was suddenly rebuffed by a powerful 
force.</p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p><b>“</b><b>I thought I sensed an unusual 
presence.”</b></p><p><i>Wha----Wait!</i></p><p><i><b>PING—BOOF!</b></i></p><p>A strong force 
collided with Rei’s mind, catapulting her consciousness into space. Rei was seeing stars, 
literally. She was helplessly being pulled through as small specks of light streaked past at 
an amazing speed.</p><p><b>…</b><i><b>ping…</b></i></p><p><b>“… </b><b>I see…You’re Sir 
Ares’s heir.”</b></p><p><i>Who’s there?! </i>Her consciousness painfully jerked to a stop 
when a small object came into her view. As if giving her head a shake, she slowly came to 
the realization that she was staring at a small, circular object. Why was she stopping 
here?</p><p><i>Huh? Is that a planet…? </i>She scanned for the second presence and warily 
noted that they were still there, watching her. However, Rei wasn’t about to let this 
opportunity go to waste; before anything else could interrupt her, she attempted to zoom-in 
onto its surface. All she saw was ice and rock.</p><p><i>There’s...nothing there. </i>She 
scanned the planet’s terrain and found it absent of any signs of 
civilization.</p><p><i><b>PING!</b></i></p><p>Again she was yanked forward—this time, 
towards the heavenly body itself. <i>Woah! </i>Rei felt her mind unconsciously trying to 
brace herself for the inevitable collision, but it turned out to be a waste of effort 
because she fell harmlessly through the rock. A chill swept through her transparent self, 
but there was no pain.</p><p>When the Martian finally came to a stop again, the first thing 
she realized was that it was dark. Rei blinked and was partially taken aback by what she 
saw. She was surrounded by rock. It comprised the floor, the walls and the 
ceiling.</p><p><i>Is this an underground chamber? </i>Rei wondered. It greatly reminded the 
woman of the underground chamber underneath Neptunalia. It was cold and dark, but there was 
a different kind of energy flowing through the walls. <i>This energy...it’s alive. Then that 
means--</i></p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>“…”</p><p>Rei went instinctively on guard. 
Someone was here.</p><p><i>Hotaru--? </i><i>No, that isn’t her</i>. <i>There’s someone else 
here, someone much stronger. </i>She didn’t like the feeling she was getting from them. 
Whoever this ‘Witch’ individual was, there was a chilling air to them. She couldn’t even be 
sure that they were human; their aura was unmoving and unwavering, as though one solely 
existed for duty alone.</p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p>Up ahead, a tall, slender figure 
came into light.</p><p><i>Is that... the ‘Witch’?</i></p><p>The raven-haired woman flinched 
when she felt an intense gaze rest on them. It was a woman, a beautiful woman with long 
green hair and crimson eyes--she couldn’t have been that much older than Haruka or Michiru 
at a first glance. Despite her young appearance though, Rei was apprehensive; there was an 
ancient, sad air to her that hinted the being was far older than she was letting 
on.</p><p><i>Who are you?! And what did you do to Hotaru? </i>Rei threw her thoughts at 
her.</p><p>“…” The mysterious stranger held up her garnet staff in response, and the crimson 
jewel at its end began to emit a red light. Its intensity steadily grew brighter and as it 
did, Rei felt her consciousness beginning to recede.</p><p><i>I-I’m going 
back?</i></p><p><i>Wait!</i></p><p><i><b>PING—BOOF!</b></i></p><p><u> (Pluto)</u></p><p>The 
green-haired stranger stood motionless, even after she felt the other presence fade away. It 
had been mildly amusing to the woman that another’s spirit had reached her despite the 
distance that separated them. There were only three others that she knew who possessed such 
a potential.</p><p>With that, the stranger raised her staff into the air once more and the 
jewel at its end began to glow again. A thin ray of crimson light shot out to the space 
directly in front of her, forming a small viewing sphere. The contents of the space were 
momentarily warped and cloudy until the haze dissipated and confirmed her suspicions. She 
unblinkingly watched the fleet of shuttles closing in onto her hideout. Judging by their 
velocities, rough estimate of mass, incoming angles and remaining distance, they would 
arrive according to her expectations.</p><p>“They are coming for you,” Green hair whipped 
around as the mysterious person turned to gaze at her young charge. “Perhaps, this will be 
the time…”</p><p>… <i>To reveal the truth.</i></p><p><u>(After some time…)</u></p><p>The 
green haired woman waited patiently as the sound of footsteps closed in. She locked on and 
traced all of their signatures since their landing. There were six of them. Her senses were 
so well tuned that she could sense their auras invading into her sanctuary, and hear each 
individual’s heart beat. They were on the surface, now at the entranceway. At the lead she 
saw the Martian and a short-blonde haired woman speaking to one another at the doorway of 
the cavern. They were strategizing—hoping to catch her off guard. Then one of them did 
something that she hadn’t expected; the taller of the two women appeared to have lost her 
patience and was going to barge right in.</p><p><i>How reckless.</i></p><p>Her crimson eyes 
narrowed and a slight frown creased her lips. She rarely let her thoughts wander—this time 
shouldn’t be an exception.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>Time slowly ticked by as she 
waited for the expected confrontation. She knew that there would be many questions and that 
she would be the target of many accusations, but she knew this was her fate. She gripped the 
handle of her staff a little. When was the last time that she felt anxious?</p><p><b>Tup! 
Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>Finally, she heard a voice.</p><p>“YOU!” The tall, furious, ruler of the 
wind came barrelling into the room and didn’t look like she was about to stop. Without so 
much as flinching, the green-haired woman calmly held out her hand and threw out a bolt of 
her power. Haruka yelped in surprise and was knocked right off of her 
feet.</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>“AHHHH!!!”</p><p>The Witch analyzed the blonde as 
she picked herself up off of the ground. There was a deep seated hatred gleaming in her dark 
green eyes and the way her adversary clenched her jaw, she knew that this being was on the 
verge of strangling the life from her very body on the spot. The only reason that she hadn’t 
was likely because she just noticed the barrier behind her.</p><p>“What are you doing to 
Hotaru?! Let her go right now!” Haruka demanded.</p><p>Haruka’s green eyes flickered to a 
spot behind her opponent to where Hotaru was being held. The girl’s appearance was still 
that of a young woman. She was hanging suspended a few inches above the cold, rocky floor of 
the tunnel, and encased within the same sphere of light that had spirited her away. The 
vacant, distant expression in her normally bright eyes almost broke the blonde’s 
heart.</p><p>“Didn’t you hear me?!” She demanded more angrily this time. “I said let her 
GO!”</p><p>When the other woman continued to ignore her demands, Haruka wasted no time in 
transforming. If this stranger wasn’t going to release Hotaru, then SHE 
WAS!</p><p>“World…”</p><p>The rest of group ran into the room as the attack was 
unleashed.</p><p>“Haruka…?!” Michiru cried, startled.</p><p>“SHAKING!”</p><p><b>Bam- 
</b><i><b>Wrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiir----KABLAM!</b></i></p><p><i>Did I get 
it?</i></p><p>There was a stunned silence as the dust particles began to clear. Everyone was 
surprised that Haruka lost her temper like that, but, more importantly, her attack had no 
effect on Hotaru’s container.</p><p>“N-No way! That’s impossible!” <i>There isn’t even a 
scratch?! </i>The wind ruler was also shocked at her apparent failure.</p><p><i>Just what is 
she?</i> They all wondered of the green-haired stranger.</p><p>A loud thud echoed throughout 
the chamber when the stranger before them abruptly lowered her garnet rod to the floor. Was 
she requesting for silence? But who did she think she was to think that she could simply 
command a group as powerful as they were with a stick?</p><p>Rei narrowed her eyes warily as 
the red jewel on her rod reflected in her dark eyes. Her earlier encounter with the woman 
still disturbed her— the memory was an important testament to their adversary’s 
capabilities.</p><p>“Finally, you are all here.” The crimson-eyed woman stated slowly. There 
was a hint of distance in her whispery words. It was as if she hadn’t spoken in a very long 
time and was trying to awaken the skill. “I have been waiting for your arrival for some time 
now.”</p><p>Haruka continued to openly glare at the stranger, feeling her anger on the verge 
of flaring up again. The hairs on the back of her neck were standing on end as trace amounts 
of her golden aura sparked up dangerously around her.</p><p>“Yeah, but if you had extended 
the invite earlier, we could’ve been here faster!” She retorted.</p><p>“Haruka, please calm 
down.” Michiru advised. She leaned in to whisper into her ear, “I understand how you feel, 
but it would be best not to do anything rash. Think of the position that we’re in… that 
Hotaru COULD be in.”</p><p>Her partner frowned, but reluctantly nodded. “Yeah, you’re 
right... we still don’t know what we’re up against,” she whispered back.</p><p><i>Everyone 
is so tense.</i> Minako felt the air currents with her powers. All of her friends had the 
same turbulent air pressure around them. It was very similar to hers right before she gained 
the power to materialize it. They were all on guard.</p><p><i>Is there going to be a 
fight?</i></p><p>The stranger was the first to break the silence, and what she said was 
about to catch them all off guard.</p><p>“I am sure that you are all aware...that the former 
King, Apollo, is gaining strength.”</p><p>Haruka’s stance faltered. “So… you know about that 
bastard, huh?”</p><p>“Interesting. Then does that make you a friend or foe?” Ami stepped up. 
Everyone had noticed that the blue-haired woman hadn’t dared to take out her computer and do 
an analysis on the stranger. “I don’t mean to be rude, but if you would like us to trust 
you, then the least you can do is introduce yourself.”</p><p>Their host closed her eyes 
momentarily, thoughtfully, before slowly opening them again. A tired expression lingered 
there.</p><p>“Very well… My name is Pluto Setsuna. However, in the past I was known as Meioh 
Setsuna. I was the head advisor to Sun King Apollo.”</p><p>“Y-You mean you knew him 
PERSONALLY?!” Haruka exclaimed, expressing the shock that everyone was feeling. “Just how 
old ARE YOU?”</p><p>“Haruka!” Michiru exclaimed, although she was equally as shocked as her 
companion.</p><p>“I-I--” The blonde tried to say something else, but nothing reasonable 
would leave her mouth. Luckily for Haruka, Rei came to her rescue.</p><p>“So, you were his 
personal advisor. Then let’s get to the point, shall we? Do you intend to cooperate with us, 
or are you the enemy?”</p><p>All talk ceased.</p><p>“You are jumping to conclusions.” 
Setsuna replied monotonously. “I am no longer in Apollo’s service but rather, the former 
Queen, his sister Serenity.”</p><p>“Queen Serenity?” Minako questioned. She frowned before 
realizing why the statement had sounded so strange. “Wait. You mean, the guy married his own 
sister?”</p><p>Again, Setsuna closed her eyes in thought. There was a slight frown on her 
face. Then, as if having come to a decision, she tapped her staff on the floor. Instantly 
the entire room was engulfed in a bright light.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“What’s going 
on?!”</p><p>“I-I can’t see!”</p><p>“…I will show you what you have sought, heirs and 
successors of the former court of Apollo.”</p><p><b>FLAAAAAAAASH!</b></p><p><i>The gloomy 
landscape melted away and was replaced by a vibrant, orange sky. Tall gold buildings rose up 
to meet their vision and glimmered with a radiant light like none of them had ever witnessed 
before. There was nothing that could parallel the artistic patterns carved within the gold, 
or the dome roofs of several of the more prominent structures. Everywhere and everything 
within this God-like paradise demanded respect, especially the breath-taking view of the 
castle that emitted the greatest source of light like a beacon amongst the 
city.</i></p><p>“The Sun was where King Apollo ruled.” They heard Setsuna’s voice rang out. 
“We, the servants and followers of his court had all once resided here. Each of your 
predecessors reigned as high Lords and Ladies who ruled their planets as representatives our 
King.”</p><p><i>The scene warped and changed to reveal a large courtroom. Sitting on a 
majestic throne, in its center, was an orange eyed, golden haired man. His purity was 
apparent in the air that he carried about him—and his smile and the kindness in his eyes, 
everything else seemed to dull in comparison. There was no denying that this was King 
Apollo. As he was, there was also no doubt that this God’s existence deserved to be 
worshipped. It was as if it were a law decreed by nature itself. However, none of them could 
understand how someone such as this could also be the ruthless murderer that was out to kill 
them now.</i></p><p><i>As for those that were gathered around him, the group perceived to be 
his subjects.</i></p><p><i>There were two rows of people that especially drew Haruka, 
Michiru, Makoto, Ami, Minako and Rei’s attention. Standing in front of the lower ranked 
subjects was the former rulers. Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus and Mars-- all of 
them were healthy and well again, and they were dressed in royal garbs that boldly displayed 
their nobility statuses. It tugged at all of the heirs’ hearts, making them ache, as the 
desire to reach out to embrace and converse—to be acknowledged—grew stronger, despite 
knowing that it was merely an illusion. They were all so preoccupied with their thoughts 
that they barely noticed that Setsuna’s past self was standing beside the throne at Apollo’s 
right hand side.</i></p><p>“We all had sworn loyalty to our King… We pledged to stay by his 
side for all of eternity. We were convinced it would be so, yet, one day, a peculiar change 
came over Apollo... one that none of us realized until it was too late. He had fallen in 
love with his twin sister, Artemis.”</p><p><i>A long, silver-haired woman approached the 
throne. All watched as Apollo warmly greeted his twin, affection shining in his orange eyes. 
Without hesitation the man invited the woman to stand by his side, where she gracefully 
accepted and took the opposite side to where his royal advisor stood. Any who had witnessed 
this ritual-like greeting concluded it was merely to honour the bond between the siblings, 
as one would to any close family member.</i></p><p>“However, when Apollo identified that his 
own feelings went beyond simple affection he began to lose his mind. He knew in his heart 
that he was supposed to be pure, to be a role model for all of his subjects…</p><p>Although 
he may have tried to hide this terrible secret for the sake of others, we all suffered the 
consequences. Soon after, the ‘battles’ began.”</p><p><i><b>Clash! 
Tinz!</b></i></p><p><i>Again the scenery warped, this time to a large battlefield within an 
arena. Below in the dirt filled ring was Ares and Aphrodite. The God and Goddess fought each 
other with all that they had, with each of them becoming increasingly exhausted as the 
seconds dragged on. Ares would repeatedly charge with his sword, surprisingly, aimed to not 
kill (as Rei, alone, would realize) but to injure. His opponent, Aphrodite behaved very 
similarly—the Goddess letting lose small bolts of her power to put distance between when it 
was required. Eventually their King would be satisfied. Eventually, he would tell them to 
stop. Once one of them was on death’s door or he grew bored of the game…</i></p><p><i>The 
sight of the two fighting shed a new light on Rei and Minako’s perspectives of their people. 
Although their predecessors may have not gotten along during their existence, it was 
apparent that they had no desire to finish the other off even when they were given the 
chance to. This was entirely different than the background that they were both raised 
in.</i></p><p><i>But that still left the greater question of ‘why’ unanswered. How could 
Apollo force his subjects to fight one another? They all 
wondered.</i></p><p><i><b>Slash!<br>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>“As time grew on, the kind light 
that Apollo ruled with faded.” Setsuna went on to explain. “His eyes became listless and his 
hair--gray, leaving behind only a shadow of his former glory. Many times I had tried to 
convince him to confide his troubles in me, yet each and every time he refused. He would 
laugh and ignore my counselling. The rare instance where he seemed to regain a sense of 
himself appeared to be when he caught a glimpse of his sister.</p><p>However… eventually, 
even in the presence of Lady Artemis he would remain in this state.</p><p>His sister was the 
first to learn of Apollo’s sinful feelings for her and at first, the kind Lady believed that 
she could convince her brother to return to the peaceful ruler that he once 
was…</p><p>…Unfortunately, her efforts were in vain.</p><p>As time passed, Apollo became 
more violent, demanding, bitter, and scornful. Once Lady Artemis realized how deeply rooted 
her brother’s obsessions had become, she fled with a group of followers. They went to the 
Moon, a single, small, heavenly object orbiting about the Planet Earth.</p><p>…I knew of my 
Lady’s plan… She came to me the night of their departure in hopes that I would leave with 
her.</p><p>I declined.”</p><p>“<i>No, I’m sorry…” Setsuna shook her head. Disappointed was 
apparent in her Lady’s light colored eyes.</i></p><p>“<i>Why?” She whispered. “Why won’t you 
come with us? It is too dangerous to stay here!”</i></p><p>“<i>I am well aware of that. 
However, I believe that one of us should stay behind for precaution’s 
sake.”</i></p><p>“<i>But there are others.”</i></p><p>“<i>If you are referring to the 
planetary rulers, I’m afraid that is not possible. They spend the majority of their time 
governing their planets, and are rarely summoned to court. What I meant was... Someone is 
needed to stay here to keep a close watch over His Majesty.”</i></p><p>“<i>But is this what 
you really want, Setsuna?!”</i></p><p>“<i>...I’m sorry. But it is my final decision.” 
Setsuna bowed her head. “Good-bye, my Lady.”</i></p><p>There was a noticeable pause before 
Setsuna spoke up again.</p><p>“I soon heard rumours that Lady Artemis had cast aside her 
name and began to rule as Queen Serenity of the Moon. She and her people cut all ties to our 
King, and began to live prosperous, peaceful lives once again. However, Apollo appeared 
unperturbed by this; one day, during a stadium battle, he confided to me that he believed 
his sister would come back to him once she was finished with her ‘temper 
tantrum’.</p><p>Lady Artemis… no, Queen Serenity never came back. Centuries later, the Sun 
Palace was in an uproar once again with news that Queen Serenity had finally given birth. 
She had given her people what they had asked… heirs, two twin girls. Lady Hotaru was one of 
them.</p><p>Apollo’s Lords and Ladies went to show their respect for this new life. Our 
King, however, was seething with rage.”</p><p><i>The throne room came into view once again. 
King Apollo was hunched over his chair, breathing heavily as if he had received a 
life-threatening injury; beads of perspiration formed on his brow. Occasionally, a few of 
the drops would slide down the sides of his face. He never knew that his sister had found 
someone else, someone other than HIM.</i></p><p><i>Who was it?! And why did she just give 
birth?</i></p><p>“<i>These girls…” He whispered under his breath, his words dripping with 
loathing. “If Artemis really did give birth to them, then that would make those brats, my 
nieces, isn’t that right?” He hesitated to call them his own flesh and blood for they were 
not entirely his. No… They were made from another, someone far inferior and unworthy of his 
sister’s affections-- someone dirty. His nieces…</i></p><p>“<i>Setsuna!” He summoned for his 
chief advisor. The other woman shortly appeared in the room with her garnet rod in 
hand.</i></p><p>“<i>Yes Your Majesty? Is there something you require of 
me?”</i></p><p><i>Apollo readjusted his stance and sat upright. The anger in his dim eyes 
was replaced by a sudden, suspicious openness.</i></p><p>“<i>Yes, I do. I heard a ‘rumour’ 
that my sister has given birth.” He studied his advisor’s calm face for any sign of 
surprise.</i></p><p>“<i>I see.” Setsuna simply replied. Seeing hardly any reaction, the man 
continued on with his request.</i></p><p>“<i>I would like you to go to the Moon in my place 
and see whether these rumours are true. If they are, come back and inform me so that I shall 
go give them my blessings myself.”</i></p><p>“… <i>As you wish, Your 
Highness….”</i></p><p>“As he had ordered, I departed the next day.</p><p>As soon as I 
arrived at my destination, I was immediately escorted to the throne room where Queen 
Serenity and her newborns resided.”</p><p><i>Setsuna stepped into the white marble throne 
room and was secretly amazed at how many guests and subjects that resided here in this ‘new 
world’. There were many strange faces, yet the green-haired woman noticed that all of her 
former companions and planet rulers were present as well.</i></p><p>“<i>Setsuna!” Setsuna 
looked up in time to see Serenity descending the steps towards her with a smile. The chief 
advisor hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to react as the distance was closed, so 
instinctively she bowed her head in respect to her Lady, who, in turn, ignored this action 
and instead proceeded to hug the other woman-- startling her!</i></p><p>“<i>Come now 
Setsuna, there is no need for that. We’re friends, are we not?”</i></p><p><i>Setsuna blinked 
back in surprise. Already she felt the beginning of a rare smile coming on, but she 
immediately squashed the reaction upon reminding herself of their audience. She knew she 
would be under suspicion since she was, in technical terms, visiting on behalf of Apollo. 
The man’s popularity had declined greatly over the recent centuries, heading in the opposite 
direction to his sister’s. If all continued along this path, in due time the royal advisor 
was certain that there would be appeals that her Lady should become the official ruler of 
Gods.</i></p><p><i>But that was only a hypothesis. She must deal with what was presented to 
her now. Setsuna wordlessly nodded in agreement.</i></p><p>“<i>Come, you must see them. They 
are absolutely adorable!” Serenity insisted.</i></p><p><i>Setsuna was taken by the hand and 
led up to the throne where a nurse held the two newborns. Swaddled in cloth, the child in 
the woman’s right arm was a beautiful golden-haired child; while in the left, there was a 
raven-haired baby girl. Both of them were sleeping soundly.</i></p><p>“The children were 
indeed an unusual sight…but it was not solely due to their physical aspects; their powers 
had already started to manifest. I had never thought that a newborn could be born with such 
powers at that age, yet these two baby girls were able to materialize energy right before my 
very eyes. It boggled the mind to think of what they may become…”</p><p>“<i>Setsuna...?”</i> 
<i>Queen Serenity questioned the silent woman.</i></p><p>“…”<i>Setsuna felt a hand rest 
lightly upon her elbow.</i></p><p>“<i>Please stay…”</i></p><p>“I never returned to 
Apollo.”</p><p><b>FLAAAAAAAASH!</b></p><p>The red light receded, leaving everyone to find 
themselves once again within the cold, damp room.</p><p>“The key…” Haruka was the first to 
speak. “The other half of the key, could it be that other girl? Setsuna was it? Where is she 
now?! Is she still on the moon orbiting Earth?” Her patience nearly slipped when the woman 
held her silence. “Oh, come on! You’ve already told us this much so why stop 
now?”</p><p>“Haruka… if she won’t talk about it, then don’t push it.” Neptune 
advised.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you know something that we don’t?” Rei asked. 
Her senses had already caught on to the uncertainty in the aquamarine-haired woman’s 
aura.</p><p>“Did something bad happen?” Minako questioned.</p><p>Everyone looked at her, 
suddenly very conscious of what they were speaking of: What if something in the past had 
gone terribly wrong? Minako had only gone through a tragedy of her own. Was it fair to dig 
into another while the wound was still fresh?</p><p>However, none of them could ignore the 
fact that she had spoken the very question that weighed heavily on all of their minds. What 
<i>did </i>Michiru and Setsuna know that they didn’t?</p><p>“I’m sorry…” Michiru quietly 
apologized to Setsuna.</p><p>Setsuna was silent for a moment, but she shook her head in 
return to this display of sympathy.</p><p>“What’s done, is done...No one can change the 
past.”</p><p>The crimson-eyed woman then addressed the others, quite ready now to let them 
all in on their inside secret.</p><p>“Apollo never showed any reaction to my sudden 
disappearance, so I lived as the new advisor of Queen Serenity, in peace, on the Moon 
Kingdom.</p><p>Her children soon grew… opening their curious eyes with understanding to what 
this world of peace had to offer. Their mother often taught the both of them within the 
palace gardens. The three of them spent countless hours together in meditation and aura 
lessons.</p><p>One particular day… I happened upon a certain lesson, and noticed something 
peculiar. As I had suspected, since the first day that I had laid eyes on them, the children 
were developing into amazing beings. It was not long before the people heard of their future 
rulers’ abilities. Some rejoiced, while others feared. The dark-haired girl, Lady Hotaru... 
her powers bent towards channelling darkness and destruction, unlike her sister, whose 
special talents were focused towards the healing and defence arts.</p><p>I should have taken 
these rumours into account… or perhaps, we should have watched them both more 
closely…”</p><p>“What happened?” Ami whispered. They were all anxiously waiting for the 
revelation that was about to be revealed to them.</p><p>“While they were still in their 
teens, a select few of the staff felt very threatened by Hotaru’s power. So they aided 
Apollo in her kidnapping.”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>“No way! You mean they got rid 
of her because they were afraid of her? How cruel can you get?!” Makoto clenched her fists 
by her sides.</p><p>“That’s terrible...” Minako whispered.</p><p><i>The fools…</i> Rei and 
Michiru agreed.</p><p>Haruka crossed her arms in a thoughtful pose. She knew what it was 
like without a family to go home to… But if they could return Hotaru to her family, would 
that make her happy? Could that be what she was reacting to?</p><p>“If that’s the case then 
why don’t we just take her home?” The tall blonde suggested. It seemed like the right thing 
to do.</p><p>However, Michiru thought differently.</p><p>“Haruka...Why do you think we found 
her on Saturn?” Her voice was barley higher than a whisper.</p><p><i><b>Lubb 
Dubb</b></i></p><p>“I-- Well, I don’t know…”</p><p>“I’m afraid... we cannot take her 
home...” The shorter Goddess continued. “...because...there is no home for her to go back 
to.”</p><p>Momentarily everyone was rendered speechless. What did Michiru mean by that? No, 
it couldn’t be could it?</p><p>“The Moon Kingdom was destroyed shortly before the Battle 
against the Sun.” Setsuna calmly stated. “Lady Hotaru… destroyed it.”</p><p>“Hotaru…? But 
you can’t really mean that.” Minako choked out. “Hotaru would never do such a 
thing!”</p><p>Setsuna ignored the comment. As she continued, the images flashed through her 
mind’s eye.</p><p>“It’s true. Brought about by Hotaru’s hand, buildings were destroyed, and 
people were killed… No one survived… Nothing did. It was all brought to ruin.”</p><p>A 
scream resounded deep within her soul, making her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“Nothing 
survived? If everything was destroyed, then how can you be here talking to us like this? You 
aren’t dead.” Rei pointed out. Setsuna kept eye contact with the Martian, yet she chose not 
to elaborate this tiny detail.</p><p><i>She’s not telling us everything. </i>Rei noted 
suspiciously.</p><p>“I had wished to discuss with you about another issue on hand,” The 
guardian continued on. “One that may be essential to our survival...”</p><p>This time no one 
interrupted. They all waited for what this strange person was about to propose to them; she 
knew more than they did, what they had wanted to know and perhaps even more. Unspoken 
consensus agreed that this Setsuna person was very serious about her matters.</p><p>“We need 
to retrieve Lady Hotaru’s heart.” She finally said.</p><p>“Huh?” The group exchanged 
surprised looks.</p><p>“I will only say this once more. It was Lady Hotaru who brought ruin 
to the Moon Kingdom. However... she did not do it without feeling guilt. After she had seen 
what she had done, the guilt that she felt, like Apollo, threatened to consume her spirit 
with sorrow. She wished to repent…but she did not know how. In the end, the young Lady chose 
to seal away her heart and was reborn.”</p><p>Minako turned her head and peered at Hotaru. 
It was as if she was seeing the girl in a different light now.</p><p><i>So...You lost 
everything too… </i> The frustration that she felt when she first stumbled upon the truth 
was still very vivid in her mind. <i>I guess we’re both more alike that I 
thought.</i></p><p><i><b>Shhhsssss…</b></i></p><p>Hotaru twitched.</p><p><i>Wait---did she 
just? </i>Minako wondered if the others had seen it too, but they were all intently watching 
her instead.</p><p>“W-Why are you all looking at me like that?”</p><p>“It was you who 
awakened Lady Hotaru.” Setsuna answered.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“Yes. Until now, she has lived 
without any memory of the incident from long ago. However…on Venus, her feelings resonated 
strongly with yours, and it is because of that, that her spirit has awoken. This is what 
brings us to our current dilemma. While her body has reverted back to its true form, without 
her heart, she is still incomplete. Her current self has become unstable; this means that as 
long she is in this state, she will unconsciously try to repeat the past tragedy once more… 
instead, this time, she may bring ruin to us all. That is why it is imperative that we 
retrieve her heart as soon as possible.” Setsuna stressed. “Even as I speak, she is slowly 
eroding away my barrier. I cannot hold Lady Hotaru with my own power for very 
long.”</p><p>“I get it.” Haruka spoke up. “So basically, you’re the only thing that’s 
standing between her and destruction. If you go down, we all do.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“But 
that’s also why you can’t go and retrieve her heart yourself. You might seem really 
powerful, but it’s taking a huge toll on your strength to maintain this barrier, isn’t it? 
How long have you been holding it again...? That’s why... you told Michiru where you were. 
You wanted us to retrieve her heart for you. You need our help.” She stared Setsuna straight 
in the eye and caught a glimpse of something behind her calm demeanour. “Heh. Fine. We’ll 
cooperate with you for now, but on two conditions. First, you’ll have to tell us where her 
heart is. And second, once this is all over, I want answers. No more secrets...Got 
that?”</p><p>The protective gleam in Haruka’s green eyes calmed Setsuna’s own wavering 
spirit a little. She still didn’t trust the woman entirely, but in the case of her young 
charge there was nothing to be concerned about. They were both after the same thing: To 
protect her; it was that sentiment that stirred emotions that she thought were long 
dead.</p><p><i>I must protect the children.</i> The green-haired woman reminded 
herself.</p><p>“Her heart is on Saturn.” Setsuna finally said. “Although you may have found 
Hotaru’s body there, you have missed her heart. Go there and find it.”</p><p>Haruka didn’t 
need to wait any longer. She didn’t need to think twice about this; her instincts were 
telling her to go. There was no other explanation of why the young girl went berserk when 
she did, or why her powers were suddenly so great.</p><p>Haruka turned around and past 
everyone else when she paused at the entranceway.</p><p>“Just for the record... I still 
don’t trust you completely. But if Hotaru is missing something, then I’ll find 
it!”</p><p>She left the room.</p><p>Michiru followed shortly and in turn was followed by 
Makoto and Ami. But when Rei turned to leave after Minako, Setsuna called to 
her.</p><p>“Heir of Ares. You cannot go with them.”</p><p>“Stop calling me that! I have a 
name!” Rei snapped back. “And why can’t I go?”</p><p><i>Rei can’t come?</i> Minako wondered, 
worriedly. She didn’t like the sounds of this.</p><p>“The atmosphere of Saturn is unfit for 
humans.” Setsuna explained.</p><p><i>She knows that I’m not a--</i> Rei realized.</p><p>“It 
is difficult as it is for a God or Goddess to tread upon that land; the poisonous gas that 
guards the young Lady’s heart will undoubtedly kill you if you should persist.”</p><p>“I’m 
stronger than you think I am. A little bit of poisonous gas won’t stop me.” She 
retorted.</p><p>Setsuna watched the Martian quietly for a moment. “This is not a question 
about power. It is simply because you are human. Your structure is different from theirs. 
From the moment you step onto Saturn, you will succumb to its atmosphere before you even 
reach the poisonous gas. Do you wish to burden your friends with the guilt of your 
death?”</p><p>That really got to Rei.</p><p>“Tch!” The Martian growled with a look of 
extreme annoyance. She knew she was being played, very well, but she couldn’t snap back 
because she knew that her death would be the last thing Minako needed.</p><p>Taking this 
into account, Rei spun on her heel and stared Minako in the eye. She wasn’t about to do 
nothing about this either.</p><p>“Rei… I can stay too,” Minako offered.</p><p>“Don’t be 
silly,” Rei scolded and shook her head. It took the raven-haired woman everything she had to 
disagree with Minako and hide the disappointment inching into her voice. After finally 
finding each other again, she honestly didn’t want to let the other woman out of her 
sight—especially to go to a dangerous planet with poisonous gases of all 
things.</p><p>“Think about who you are. What if something happens on Saturn and they need 
you? You can help them when I can’t.”</p><p>“But--” Minako held her breath when a red strand 
sparked in Rei’s palm. Why did it look so familiar?</p><p>“Here, take this.” Without waiting 
for the blonde to reply, Rei grabbed Minako’s hand and there was a spark of power between 
them. The red strand briefly wrapped around their hands before slipping beneath the delicate 
skin that held it.</p><p><b>Foom…foom…foom..</b></p><p>Minako could hardly believe it. 
<i>It’s so warm…! It’s almost like it’s…mixing with my own?</i></p><p>“I can’t go,” Rei 
repeated. “But with this, I’ll still be right there with you; anything that you see, I’ll 
see. Anything that you hear, I’ll hear too. If I can’t go, then I might as well do something 
useful and act as a form of communication between our parties.”</p><p>Minako searched her 
eyes for a moment. “...All right. I understand.” She could understand the situation, but it 
didn’t mean that she had to like it. They were finally beginning to understand each other 
and now they were going to be planets apart (literally). “Well...I guess I should be going 
now...”</p><p>“Yeah...”</p><p>The both of them stood there awkwardly. It felt kind of 
silly.</p><p>“I--”</p><p>“Actually!”</p><p>The two women stared at one another for a second, 
realizing that they were about to say something at the very same time.</p><p>“Umm... sorry, 
what were you about to say?” Minako asked. Behind the Martian, she could see Setsuna turn 
her attention away to reinforce her barrier around Hotaru. That was when she noticed Rei’s 
face. “Rei...? Is everything all right? Your face is so red.”</p><p>“Umm…well, about 
earlier. I-It was different.” She stuttered out.</p><p>“Different?” Minako tilted her 
head.</p><p>“Your tradition,” She muttered.</p><p>It took a minute before it clicked for the 
Venusian. “Oh! Right, well...you know, I thought you weren’t...ready...? Yeah, ready! 
Soooo... I had to modify it. You know how it is!”</p><p><i>It’s really too bad. </i>She 
thought to herself. It would have been nice to passionately kiss the woman 
again.</p><p>“...You really think so? A-Actually...I think, I can handle it 
now...”</p><p>“Huh?” Minako tilted her head to the side and studied Rei’s averted gaze. It 
then hit her, stunning her like a wayward meteorite had struck her. She had nearly forgotten 
about their new link.</p><p><i>Wait. She can read my thoughts?! </i>The blonde woman saw Rei 
cringe at the mental screech. Apparently it was true.</p><p>But another thought entered the 
picture. If Rei had just read her thoughts, then she knew what she was thinking and was in 
fact responding to what she was contemplating at the time…</p><p><i>Did she just say that 
she didn’t mind if I…?</i> She was sure that her eyes couldn’t go any wider, but she was 
wrong.</p><p>Rei nervously glanced up as Minako approached her. The blonde wasn’t thinking 
about anything now. There was only silence and the thick tension within the air that 
separated them.</p><p>Her amethyst eyes briefly met Minako’s blues ones before falling down 
from that gaze. Her own gaze began to wander as she found a sudden interest in the woman’s 
other facial features: The curve of her nose, how pink and soft those lips looked. Thoughts 
of that subject brought her cheeks to burn even more; <i>what in the name of Mars am I 
thinking? </i>What was she going to think next? That Minako’s ears were cute? She would 
ponder on it, but what if Minako read her mind?</p><p>Minako giggled. “Hmm...I don’t 
know.”</p><p><i>Stupid!</i></p><p>“No, you aren’t.” When she heard Rei’s thoughts go silent, 
she reached out and cupped the Martian’s cheek. Rei went rigid. She kept thinking about the 
way it was on Neptune, and the anticipation was driving her crazy. As Minako started to lean 
in, her stomach was starting to do flip-flops. She wasn’t going to do it like that again, 
was she?</p><p>When their lips were barely inches apart, Rei couldn’t stop herself. She 
flinched. Minako, upon feeling this, let loose a small smile and quickly gave the other 
woman a peck on the cheek instead.</p><p>“Silly Rei-bear...” She sighed a little. <i>It’s 
still the modified program for you. </i>Rei wasn’t quite ready after all, but at least she
