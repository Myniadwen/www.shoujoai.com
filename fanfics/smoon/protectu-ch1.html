<h1>I'll Protect You</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nobara.html">NobaraThorne</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It happened a year ago tonight..
I was walking home late, with nothing but the moonlight to guide my 
way...
*************
Mako looked up at the night sky as she climbed the familiar stairway 
outside her apartment building. &quot;The moon looks... so huge 
tonight....&quot; she said aloud, her eyes a glassy green in the luminous 
starlight...
**************
Then, you suddenly saw me
**************
&quot;Mako!&quot; someone shouted, causing the starry-eyed girl to turn her head 
to the voice. &quot;Mako!&quot; It was Minako....
**************
And you ran toward me, calling
**************
&quot;Mina-chan?&quot; Mako whispered in question. &quot;Minako! What are you doing 
here?&quot; The blonde ran up the stairs toward her friend, looking 
slightly alarmed, uneasy....
**************
You looked so scared...
**************
&quot;Oh, Mako-chan..&quot; she panted, clutching the side of her deep orange 
shirt.&quot;I wanted to- to talk to you before you head inside... is that 
ok?&quot;
Mako was confused. Why did Minako want to talk to her so badly? She 
hasn&#39;t seen her in almost a month...
**************
I asked you what was wrong
**************
&quot;Sure, Minako&quot; she replied, &quot;But, what&#39;s wrong? You look really upset. 
Did something happen?&quot; Minako&#39;s sky blue eyes filled with held-back 
tears. &quot;Well, yes, something did happen... a bad thing, actually...&quot;
**************
You started to tell me things of both cruelty and injustice
**************
Minako told her friend about what happened at school the other day. A 
group of girls tried to attack her in an laneway for beating their 
volleyball team in the finals. She got away, but the attack left her 
shaking for hours. Then the girls told her coach she was taking drugs, 
handing him modified pics. He took her off the team. 
&quot;But that&#39;s not fair!&quot; interrupted Mako, her hands balled up into 
fists, &quot;You love volleyball!&quot; Minako still looked scared. &quot;I&#39;m afraid 
if I try to get back on, those wenches will try to kill me! They&#39;ve 
done things like this before, and teachers never believe us when we 
tell them... and that&#39;s not all...&quot; 
Mako&#39;s expression was sympathetic again. &quot;What else, Mina-chan?&quot;....
***************
Things that made you sad and slightly broken....
***************
Minako&#39;s pent up tears finally splashed across her face. &quot;Luna and 
Artemis came by my house a while ago. They said my crystal is getting 
weak, and it might not work anymore. I can&#39;t battle.&quot; 
***************
And it hurt me to see you cry as you told me.
***************
Mako&#39;s eyes began to shine with tears as she saw her friend sob. 
&quot;Minako...&quot; she said quietly, her voice breaking as she talked, 
&quot;Please don&#39;t cry. It hurts...it hurts to see you in so much pain....&quot;
***************
I asked, &quot;Who did this to you?&quot;
***************
Mako went from sad to angry. &quot;Alright, who are these girls? Do they go 
to your school?&quot; Minako didn&#39;t answer. She sat on the steps and cried 
into her flowing blue skirt. &quot;Mina-chan? Tell me! I&#39;m here for you! 
Mina-chan?&quot;
Mako sat down next to her. &quot;Hey now... why aren&#39;t you answering me?&quot;
Minako looked up from her now tear drenched lap. She looked extremely 
hurt. &quot;Your... here for me?&quot; Mako exclaimed &quot;Of course I am! Why 
wouldn&#39;t I be??&quot; &quot;Because, Mako... you didn&#39;t come over to my house 
when I asked you to a month ago... and we haven&#39;t talked since. I 
thought you didn&#39;t like me anymore....&quot; Minako&#39;s face shone with 
sorrow in the silver light of the moon.
***************
Your tears, those silver tears that sparkled sadly in the moonlight, 
silently answered me.
***************
Mako was stunned. ///Oh my god... I forgot to go to Minako&#39;s house... 
But it wasn&#39;t my fault, I was really busy this month! I had projects 
and cooking school and training!... I was... too busy... Too 
busy...///
***************
I realized who did this all along, by ways of neglect and lack of 
consern for you, my friend, my love....
***************
It was me.
***************
&quot;Mina-chan, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; she cried, wrapping her arms around Minako 
tightly. &quot;I was so cold! I forgot about my friends, please don&#39;t hate 
me!&quot;
***************
And I&#39;m sorry.
***************
She stood up and took her friend&#39;s hand. &quot;Minako...&quot; she sniffed 
croakley, wiping her tears on her arm. &quot;I won&#39;t do this anymore. I 
won&#39;t forget about you. I&#39;m going to help you out of this, and with 
everything from now on, okay?&quot; Minako wiped her tears as well and 
nodded, smiling. &quot;Arigato, Mako-chan. Your-the best...&quot;
***************
From then on I took an oath to for ever defend you.
Help you through harsh society, tough choices...
***************
Mako smiled back. &quot;You don&#39;t deserve to have such a hard time, 
Mina-chan. I&#39;m going to bust those bitches who got you kicked off, and 
talk to that stupid coach.and- why do you still look sad?....&quot; 
***************
Because together, we can make them understand....
***************
Minako&#39;s face fell. &quot;Mako.. my cryst-&quot; Mako covered her lips with her 
finger and smiled again. &quot;Don&#39;t worry...&quot;
***************
Just Remember,
***************
&quot;But, Mako-chan...&quot; Minako began again, but Mako silenced her with a 
kiss. She gasped and pulled away. &quot;No Mako, I don&#39;t need this.&quot; She 
turned her back to Mako, silently wishing she woulnd&#39;t. She felt the 
same way.
***************
Never Forget...
***************
Mako placed her hand lightly on her shoulder. &quot;Why?&quot; she asked, hurt 
by Minako&#39;s words. Minako turned around and smiled. &quot;No, I&#39;m wrong. I 
need this more than ever.&quot; And with that, she retuned Mako&#39;s kiss. 
Mako&#39;s lips broke away and quietly mouthed,
***************
&quot;I&#39;ll Protect You.&quot;</pre>
