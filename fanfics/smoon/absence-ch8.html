<h1>Absence (part 8 of 60)</h1>

<a href="../smoon/absence-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Sanjuro wandered into the newsroom of the Yokohama Daily and over to his 
desk. He dumped himself down into his chair, causing it to give an 
ominous creak, then dropped his bag onto the floor. These eight o&#146; clock 
starts were a killer and running around all night in a dangerous 
neighbourhood after a mysterious woman didn&#39;t help either. Sanjuro ran 
his fingers through his black, short, spiky hair and exhaled heavily. 
They didn&#39;t pay him enough to get up this early.

&quot;Hey, Sanjuro! Still alive, huh? Or did you take my advice and stay 
home?&quot; Ryoji said as he approached, throwing Sanjuro&#39;s breakfast on top 
of the man&#146;s desk.

Sanjuro perked up when he saw Ryoji, mainly because he came bearing 
food. &quot;For your information, my plan worked,&quot; he retorted with a smug 
smile, relaxing back in his seat and putting his hands behind his head, 
before planting his feet up on the desktop.

&quot;Sure, Sanjuro,&quot; Ryoji drawled out, obviously not believing him.

&quot;It did, alright! You wouldn&#39;t believe what I saw! Do you realise there 
are monsters out there? I mean real, honest-to-goodness, *monsters*. I 
saw people die, man! And that woman, the masked hero? She can throw 
fireballs and stuff! She really kicked some ass last night...&quot; Sanjuro 
gazed up at the ceiling, remembering. &quot;She&#39;s so cool....&quot; he finished in 
a whisper.

Ryoji shook his head and let out an exaggerated breath. &quot;It&#39;s a shame 
when such a star reporter cracks,&quot; Ryoji remarked sarcastically. &quot;I 
suppose she gave you her number as well and asked you to call her?&quot;

&quot;No, but I gave her mine,&quot; Sanjuro said, causing Ryoji to roll his eyes. 
&quot;My work number anyway.&quot;

&quot;This reaches a whole new level of pathetic for you. Congratulations,&quot; 
Ryoji deadpanned, giving a fake smile to his colleague.

&quot;It&#39;s true, I swear! I even took pic--&quot; Sanjuro stopped when he realised 
he didn&#39;t exactly have those pictures.

&quot;Took pictures?&quot; Ryoji finished for the spiky-haired man. &quot;Then give me 
a look at them.&quot;

&quot;Uh... they haven&#39;t been developed yet...&quot; Sanjuro mumbled, looking away 
from his friend.

Ryoji gave Sanjuro a pointed look. &quot;Right... how convenient.&quot;

&quot;Ahh, screw you. You just wait until I write this story. I smell 
promotion, I smell awards--&quot; Sanjuro began irritably.

&quot;I smell BS,&quot; Ryoji laughed.

Sanjuro scowled at him. &quot;Go away,&quot; he ordered. He had had enough of 
being made fun of.

Ryoji continued laughing as he walked over to his own desk. Sanjuro 
decided to ignore the annoying man and checked the &#39;in&#39; tray on his desk 
instead. He picked up the only sheet of paper in it. &#145;High School fair 
brings in record numbers&#146; the paper was labelled at the top, with the 
details about the story following beneath it. Riveting stuff. The editor 
really expected Sanjuro to write this boring drivel? He balled up the 
report request and threw it in the trashcan beside his desk.

Sanjuro decided that he should get started on his article about the 
masked woman instead. That story was much more interesting and exciting; 
it would definitely appeal to more readers than that other dull story. 
Sanjuro knew that he had told the woman that he wouldn&#39;t put a report 
about his experiences last night in the Daily, but it was all right to 
merely get a head start. Maybe he could get a job at the Gazette or the 
Telegraph with this story and have it printed there. She never said he 
couldn&#146;t do that, did she? But first he needed a name to call her. 
Something like, &#145;The Fiery Avenger&#146; except more... dynamic....

Sanjuro shoved some of his breakfast in his mouth and then began to jot 
down some notes. The story of the year was in the making!

******

Santhesis began typing on his computer keyboard again as the human, 
Ryoji Yamamoto, walked past him. The youma had been working at the 
Yokohama Daily, a medium to distribute information happening in the city 
and the world to the human masses, for nearly a month now and finally 
his strategic placement here had paid off. He was supposed to spread 
false information in the event that the newspaper obtained evidence of 
the impending invasion. But instead, the disguised youma infiltrator had 
become quite adept at writing human sports coverage, a skill he was not 
particularly proud of, since the humans had been completely clueless 
about what was happening in their world... until now. It seemed that the 
dim-witted male, Sanjuro Watanabe, had actually stumbled upon one of 
Lord Khairephon&#146;s raiding parties and somehow escaped with his life. But 
that was not all. As an added bonus, the reporter also knew about the 
female with the power of fire at her fingertips. Rodoth would be most 
pleased.

Santhesis stopped typing once Ryoji had settled down at his desk, and 
picked up the human&#146;s long-range communication device, the &#39;telephone&#39; 
resting on his own desk. The youma spy dialled the number for the 
Ragnarok nightclub, the headquarters for Lord Khairephon&#146;s force in 
Yokohama.

&quot;Ragnarok,&quot; answered the human voice on the other end of the line.

Santhesis spat a guttural phrase quietly into the receiver. The other 
end was silent for a moment, then another human voice spoke.

&quot;Report,&quot; it ordered firmly.

Santhesis recognised the voice as Makareus&#39; appointed youma leader for 
this city, and his own commander, Rodoth.

&quot;This is Santhesis reporting from the Yokohama Daily. I have encountered 
important information....&quot;

******

Rodoth put down the phone and allowed himself a small smile. So, they 
now had a lead on the special human. With any luck, the reporter at the 
Yokohama Daily Santhesis had mentioned would feed the agent more 
information about the female, and eventually, they would have enough to 
strike directly at her. Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be necessary if Rodoth&#39;s 
currently devised plan worked. Khairephon wanted the human alive 
however, no doubt to challenge her to a fight and kill her for himself; 
he was prone to behaviour like that. It would be unfortunate that the 
berserker would only have the female&#146;s dead body to indulge his violent 
nature with. Threats were to be erased, not toyed with. That was Lord 
Makareus&#146; way... the *correct* way.

Rodoth turned towards the door as one of Thrinakie&#39;s youma entered. All 
of Thrinakie&#39;s followers had been charged with finding new rips in 
reality that could be used as gateways to their home dimension, and 
judging by the youma&#39;s excited appearance, a new one had finally been 
found. Rodoth would have to ask Khairephon if more of Lord Makareus&#146; 
youma agents could be sent through. Stealth rather than violence was 
always the best way to work.

******

Rei walked through the Hikodo gangland late at night, making no effort 
to hide herself. The miko was just a lone, helpless and innocent, girl 
walking the unsafe streets late in the evening on her way home. She 
hoped that she made a tempting target for the youma... and tried not to 
think about what else would be tempted. Damn youma; why did they have to 
choose this hellhole of a neighbourhood to congregate to?

Rei sighed. She knew why. The youma could hunt here all they wanted and 
not have to worry about the local authorities investigating the 
unfortunate people&#146;s disappearances. No police officer would patrol this 
area no matter how much they were paid. Besides, the police probably 
wouldn&#39;t care if some indigent who lived in the Hikodo gangland vanished 
without a trace. Who cared if some homeless person or drug addict got 
killed after all? Rei made a face and shook her head at the thought. It 
was a sad and bitter truth.

Rei continued walking until she heard frightened cries for help coming 
from a distance. She cursed and quickly ran in the direction of the 
shouts. As the calls grew louder and clearer to Rei&#146;s ears, she came 
towards what looked, at first, like a long wide trench. She then 
realised that it was actually, in fact, a large light grey concrete 
half-pipe apparently used for draining rainwater. It had to be at least 
ten feet wide and a hundred metres in length. There were several barred 
holes dotted along either side of the sluice where they connected to the 
sewer system. The cries were originating from the bottom of it.

Rei got on her stomach once she neared the canal and crawled &#39;commando 
style&#39; over to the edge to take a cautious peek down inside. The Fire 
Senshi saw that there were about three rather nondescript people, two 
men and a woman, cowering in the middle of the half-pipe structure. They 
were all shouting for help while a tall gangly man stood menacingly over 
them. Rei&#146;s brow creased as her sharp senses attuned to the paranormal 
pricked up at the sight of the lithe figure. No, it was not a man.

The youma had a pale brown complexion--the colour of decay--and its body 
was completely devoid of hair. Its dangling arms were long and spindly, 
with its hands reaching just slightly past its knees. The monster&#146;s 
fingers also seemed overly long, but as Rei strained her eyes, she 
realised that they weren&#39;t exactly just fingers. No, they were mostly 
its fingernails... and each one was like a stiletto. The Senshi of Fire 
imagined that the youma had to be extremely careful when it was picking 
its nose.

The youma turned its head a little, as if searching for something, and 
inadvertently gave Rei an unobstructed view of its face. It certainly 
wouldn&#39;t win any beauty prizes. The youma didn&#39;t appear to have any lips 
and its mouth was in a permanent rictus of a wide, sinister, 
sharp-toothed grin. And its eyes... the youma&#39;s eyes were black holes. 
Rei looked at them and shivered. It was said that the eyes were the 
windows to one&#39;s soul... and this creature&#146;s soul was black.

The youma appeared to be waiting for something, or someone. It ignored 
the wails of the three people, not at all disturbed by them, and looked 
around the canal instead. Rei surmised it was probably waiting for its 
ugly buddies to come and help it carry its &#145;prey&#146;. However, the 
monster&#146;s wait was about to be cut short. It was time for baldy to learn 
that no one kidnaps innocent people in this neighbourhood while the 
Senshi of Fire was around! With that last resolved thought, Rei stood up 
and transformed, willing her fuku to change into the last battle outfit 
she had worn.

&quot;MARS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;I am a fighter of justice,&quot; shouted Sailor Mars, down at the youma, her 
transformation complete, &quot;and I will punish you!&quot;

The youma turned its head slowly up at her and then tilted it casually 
to one side, giving the Fire Senshi the impression that the creature was 
mocking her. However, the youma then abruptly imploded, completely 
disappearing into nothing. The only remaining part of the creature that 
could be seen was its shadow.

&quot;What the...?&quot; breathed a puzzled Mars. Sailor Mars watched the youma&#39;s 
shadow as it moved up the other side of the canal and across the street 
at the top, before blending into the other shadows in the moonlight, 
effectively vanishing from view.

&quot;I must have a reputation now,&quot; mused Mars once the youma had fled.

The Senshi of Fire gazed down at the people who were still cowering in 
the half-pipe structure below. With almost laid-back ease, she jumped 
off the edge of the sluice and agilely slid down the smooth side to the 
bottom on the balls of her feet.

Once Sailor Mars had reached the bottom of the sluice, she quickly 
approached the people, who had all now ceased their cries for help. 
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re all okay now.&quot; she said in a soothing voice. &quot;That, um, man 
is gone....&quot;

However, all three still cowered. Mars sighed wearily... but then, that 
youma had been pretty scary looking. She supposed it was only natural 
for the people to still be frightened. Undeterred, Mars reached down and 
placed her hands under a man&#39;s armpits, and began to lift him to his 
feet, hoping a little bodily assistance would snap at least one member 
of the group out of their fearful states. &quot;Here, on your fe-- AHH!&quot;

One of the &#39;people&#39; pulled her arm-turned-blade out of Mars&#39; side, red 
droplets dotting the pipe floor. The miko let go of the man with a gasp 
and staggered backwards, holding her right side, eyes wide with shock. 
She stumbled and fell, landing on her backside. Sailor Mars looked on 
with rising panic as the three people dropped their human masquerades 
and turned into their true forms; youma.

The youma that had stabbed Mars was female and looked quite human... 
except for her green skin and the arms that ended in long, sharp, 
sword-like blades... one of which was red with the Fire Senshi&#146;s blood. 
The man who she had tried to help looked like he was made of rock and 
was absolutely huge. His head almost reached the top of the canal and 
his ham sized fists looked like they could shatter steel. The last youma 
was also built for close combat; it was almost as large as his rock 
companion and appeared crustacean. It was covered in armoured plates 
with giant pincers for hands; the snipping claws seemed positively eager 
to cut Mars in two.

Sailor Mars mentally cursed herself for ignoring her instincts. It was 
clear now that it had been a trap. The presence of the gangly youma 
earlier had waylaid the attention of her astute senses, making her 
believe that the signals she was getting from around the canal were 
residual ones from the creature. Damn it; she had been stupid! She 
should have known! Mars gritted her teeth in pain and in anger at 
herself. Gods, her side hurt so much! And if that wasn&#146;t enough, she was 
losing blood... and lots of it.

The rock youma raised both his fists high above his head, and brought 
them down at Sailor Mars, attempting to pulverise her to a mushy paste. 
Mars scrambled desperately backwards and spread her legs as the fists 
cracked the concrete floor between them. Mars let go of her weeping 
side, her hand soaked with blood. She rolled deftly backwards and into a 
standing position, leaving a red handprint behind. More of her blood 
decorated the floor of the sluice with the movement.

&quot;FIRE SOUL BIRD!&quot;

Sailor Mars let loose a bird constructed of fire at the rock youma. The 
bird smashed squarely into his chest, the flames licking around his 
stone form. Mars swallowed down her panic as she saw that her attack had 
done nothing to harm the creature, bar leaving his tough skin slightly 
blackened.

There was a wild shriek from the blade youma as she defied the laws of 
physics and began running along the right vertical side of the smooth 
grey canal towards Mars.

The miko darted backwards as one blade slashed in front of her face, 
nearly badly gouging her features.

The youma followed the blow smoothly, hacking with the other blade high 
at Sailor Mars&#39; leg, tearing a large gash along her left thigh before 
the girl could react.

Mars retaliated by smashing her right blood-covered fist directly into 
the face of the youma, temporarily stunning it. Then she executed a leg 
swipe, ignoring the pain of her injuries. The bladed youma was deposited 
on her side but quickly swiped at Mars&#39; legs, no doubt hoping to catch 
the raven-haired girl unawares. It was to be disappointed, though, as it 
was met with air while Mars leapt further backwards, narrowly evading 
the strike and putting some distance between her adversaries and 
herself.

Sailor Mars knew she had to escape from this fight; there was very 
little chance she could win while she was bleeding all over the place. 
The sneak attack to her side would be a mortal one if she didn&#146;t get the 
stab medical attention soon. Already the blood loss was starting to 
affect her mind, making it feel as though she was floating on air. The 
Fire Senshi wished she could just have a chance to sit long enough to 
regain her bearings... not to mention catch her breath.

However, there was no time for Mars to even indulge in the shortest of 
respites. The armoured youma lumbered forward, stepping over the prone 
blade youma, his huge feet barely missing stomping his ally into the 
concrete floor. As the gigantic humanoid crustacean snapped its pincers 
threateningly at Sailor Mars, she knew that if she got caught in the 
creature&#146;s grasp, she would die for sure. Or at the very least, lose a 
limb.

The youma lunged with one claw, trying to grab the miko. Mars strafed as 
nimbly as she could with her wounds to the right, dodging it, and then 
ducked as the second pincer flew at her midsection. She immediately 
rolled backwards as the claw sailed overhead, looking at the end of the 
waterless canal behind her as she did so. It ended in a smooth wall. How 
was Sailor Mars supposed to get out of this situation? The half-pipe 
sides looked... they looked... really... steep. Mars swayed unsteadily 
on her feet as her head felt even lighter than it had previously, 
causing her vision and thoughts to swim.

Sailor Mars shook her head hard to clear it. Her eyes refocused, only to 
see the rock youma&#39;s tombstone-sized fist coming straight for her face. 
Mars let herself fall backwards, allowing the fist to fly over her body. 
She then frantically rolled to one side as a pincer demolished the floor 
of the canal where she had lain. Mars hurriedly jumped to her feet, only 
to be cut shallowly across the forehead by a blade. She was going to 
die. Her head was beginning to float again, addling her mental processes 
and affecting her ability to react to the relentless onslaught of 
attacks. Sailor Mars was going to die and no one even knew she was here. 
No one knew about the youma in Yokohama, or about Kar... Khain... what 
was the name again...?

The Senshi of Fire was brought back to some semblance of reality when 
she realised a large flat granite surface was careening towards her. She 
moved on pure reflex to her left, but it was too late; the rock youma&#39;s 
fist scored a glancing blow to her right shoulder. The force behind even 
the slightest impact from such a strike was enough to make the girl feel 
as though she had been smacked by a heavy sledgehammer. Mars screamed in 
agony as her body spun around in the air while being thrown backwards. 
She hit the concrete floor and skidded along the middle of the canal, 
eventually coming to rest near the end wall.

Sailor Mars lay on her back looking up at the stars twinkling in the 
dark night&#146;s sky through half-closed lavender eyes. The ground was 
trembling with a thud-thud sound beneath her, the vibrations 
occasionally sending rhythmic jolts through her prone body. Her right 
arm felt strange... and the right half of her coat was all wet. Her 
head... the thud sound was coming closer now... but it was nice to just 
take in the beauty of the night sky. Mars&#146; eyes shifted lazily to the 
clear full moon that shone brighter and more vibrant than any star in 
the heavens above.

The moon... it was so beautiful. The moon. Sailor Mars was sure that it 
held some great significance she couldn&#146;t quite put her finger on. 
Unbidden, a tear suddenly leaked out of one of her eyes. An image of a 
smiling blonde girl with long hair styled into twin odangos came into 
Mars&#146; mind. The girl was important somehow. She was... special to Sailor 
Mars. Usa... Usagi...

Yes. That was the girl&#39;s name. Usagi Tsukino. The thudding noises were 
even closer now. The image of... Usagi... changed, a crescent moon 
appearing emblazoned on her forehead. The moon... Sailor Moon...

Yes. Usagi was Sailor Moon. But... no. She was more than that. Usagi was 
something even more important than Sailor Moon. The image in Sailor 
Mars&#146; mind&#146;s eye changed yet again with Usagi now dressed like royalty; 
in a rich gown adorned with delicate butterfly wings on the back and 
with a golden crown gracing her blonde head. The moon... the Moon 
Princess...

Yes. Usagi was the Moon Princess also. But that still wasn&#39;t it... there 
was something very important that Mars was forgetting, something that 
she should never forget. The image of Usagi turned back to the first 
form, the girl simply dressed in her school uniform. Sailor Mars almost 
had it now. It was so close... more tears flowed from the miko&#146;s eyes. 
The thudding was now nearly upon her...

The moon... Usagi was the princess. Yes, that was correct, but... no, 
Usagi was *her* princess; she was her... love. Sailor Mars loved that 
girl in her mind, she loved her! Usagi was the love of her life; she was 
her true love, her only love. How could Mars forget such a thing? Her 
princess was the love that she would die eternally for, the reason she 
fought. Mars fought for Usagi, the Moon Princess, because she loved her! 
She would continue to fight for the angel until her last breath was 
gone, until her body became dust, until Time itself ended. And none of 
those moments had occurred yet. No, not yet. So Sailor Mars should 
fight. She should get up and FIGHT!

Sailor Mars leapt to her feet and rammed her right shoulder against the 
wall, popping the joint back into place... but there was no pain. She 
turned and caught the blade youma&#39;s downward slice with one hand and 
smashed the palm of her other straight into the monster&#39;s face, 
shattering her nose in a shower of cartilage and purplish liquid. The 
youma stumbled backwards, letting out a screech of pain, before toppling 
over.

Mars ducked as a pincer ripped into the wall behind her, scoring a large 
groove in the concrete. She nimbly rolled under the thick 
carapace-covered legs of the crustacean youma and in front of it, 
effectively vanishing briefly from the creature&#146;s sight. Sailor Mars 
heard a heavy grinding movement behind her and she immediately leapt as 
high as she could, performing a perfect leg split in the air... and just 
in the nick of time. The crustacean youma&#39;s claw flashed under Mars&#146; 
legs and tore into the rock youma&#39;s chest behind the raven-haired girl. 
The iron-like pincer burst through the hard stone skin and into the soft 
flesh beneath, literally shredding its vital organs. Sailor Mars landed 
skilfully on top of the crustacean youma&#39;s extended arm, using her own 
arms to balance herself.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

A roaring ball of fire flew point blank into the crustacean youma&#39;s 
unarmoured eyes, cooking them until a steaming viscous fluid popped 
sickeningly from the blackened orbs. The flames continued to burn along 
the monster&#146;s optic nerves inside his skull, reaching the brain and 
liquefying it into a hot soup instantly.

Sailor Mars bounded off the falling hulk and to the floor of the 
half-pipe, only to meet the blade youma&#39;s furious charge. Mars violently 
forestalled her rush by kicking out hard and hitting the youma in her 
stomach, sending her over to its rock companion&#146;s decaying corpse.

&quot;BURNING MANDALA!&quot;

The youma collapsed to her knees, her skin running like wax as a barrage 
of fire rings burnt it asunder. The metallic blades that were her arms 
began to drip onto the concrete, forming two pools of silver. The 
creature burnt until her body was nothing but grey ashes. Only slowly 
solidifying, almost mirror-like, puddles shining in the moonlight on the 
canal&#39;s floor were left of her.

Sailor Mars panted with exhaustion as she dropped to her knees, the pain 
of her serious wounds returning. She didn&#39;t know exactly what had come 
over her, but she had fought like never before. Mars gingerly felt the 
inside of her coat... it was soaked with blood. She had to get medical 
attention, and soon. It had been a miracle that she had snapped out of 
her dreamlike daze while sustaining such blood loss.

Sailor Mars used the huge bodies of the rock and crustacean youma to 
help her climb out of the sluice before they disintegrated... although 
the agony radiating from her shoulder and right side hampered her all 
the while. Once she had escaped the concrete canal, the Fire Senshi 
staggered laboriously through the Hikodo gangland leaving copious 
amounts of red fluid dripping behind her... and an unintentional red 
trail for the shadows....

******

Sailor Mars leaned heavily against an alley wall. The hospital was right 
across from her, at last. The miko hadn&#146;t thought she was going to make 
it. She was so tired... she just needed to rest her eyes for-- no! Mars 
shook her head furiously, trying her utmost to stay awake. She knew that 
to give in to the lethargy that threatened to consume her mind was to 
give up on life.

Sailor Mars detransformed and began to struggle to the hospital entrance 
when she spotted something odd. If that wasn&#146;t enough, a familiar 
tickling sensation on her sharp senses accompanied the strange sight. At 
least her instincts were still in working order despite her wandering 
mind. That man standing rigidly near the double-door entrance of the 
medical facility seemed to be looking for something... or someone. He 
was wearing a suit that seemed somewhat uncomfortable for him, and was 
busy looking around the street... clearly in the most inconspicuous 
fashion he could manage... which, Rei observed, wasn&#146;t very 
inconspicuous at all. It was the way he carried himself; it just wasn&#39;t 
normal. It wasn&#39;t... human.

Rei quickly retreated into the darkness of the alley, making sure that 
the suited man hadn&#146;t noticed her. The youma had this particular 
hospital staked out... damn. The enemy had certainly gotten all of the 
angles covered this time. There wasn&#39;t another hospital nearby that Rei 
thought she could live to see... so she took the only other option she 
had left. As Rei moved back down the alley, sliding her body against the 
wall, her dark red blood smeared a macabre form of graffiti for the 
brickwork.

Tsubasa lounged on his rather worn couch in his apartment watching late 
night television. He had been staying up late the past few days awaiting 
the sound of Megumi&#39;s return, even though he was usually exhausted in 
the morning. Tsubasa worried about that girl... more than he ought to.

Megumi abused him almost everyday with insults, but for some reason, 
Tsubasa liked her. A lot. The twenty-one year old felt as though he had 
some sort of schoolboy crush. Though, in truth, that tended to happen 
more times than he cared to admit. There was just something about her... 
she was so pretty... her hair... and her eyes... Tsubasa shook his head, 
clearing the thoughts. He shouldn&#39;t be so shallow, but he couldn&#39;t deny 
that Megumi was the picture of beauty. Despite her apparent acerbic 
temperament, he was sure that inside she was just as beautiful.

Tsubasa perked up and sat upright as he heard the plodding footsteps of 
someone climbing up the apartment building staircase outside his 
apartment door. It was probably Megumi; he knew none of the other 
tenants would still be up at this time of the night. To make sure, the 
man glanced at his clock on the wall... it was a quarter past one in the 
morning. Tsubasa wondered exactly what it was that Megumi did all 
evening. Most likely she was out clubbing or something similar. Tsubasa 
sighed. She really shouldn&#146;t do that when she needed to get up so early 
for work in the morning.

Tsubasa heard Megumi&#39;s apartment door open and then a loud thump. 
Curious, and wanting to see if the raven-haired girl was okay, Tsubasa 
got up from the couch and opened his apartment door... revealing a most 
unwelcome sight.

&quot;Megumi!&quot; ripped involuntarily from his throat.

Megumi was sprawled halfway in her apartment, a large smear of blood on 
the door. Tsubasa rushed anxiously to her side, his heart in his mouth 
and panic mounting inside him... which rapidly hastened in its rise as 
he got a closer look at how drenched with blood his neighbour&#146;s clothes 
were.

&quot;Megumi! Can you hear me?!&quot; Tsubasa shouted frantically.

Megumi simply lay there, totally unresponsive. Tsubasa hurriedly felt 
for her pulse, sweat starting to bead on his brow. It was still there, 
thank god, but it wasn&#39;t very strong at all. All of a sudden Megumi&#146;s 
eyes fluttered open, but then closed again slightly, becoming lidded.

&quot;Megumi?! Don&#39;t move; I&#39;ll call an ambulance!&quot; Tsubasa looked madly 
around Megumi&#39;s apartment, searching for a phone, but it appeared the 
girl didn&#146;t have one. As he was about to run to his own apartment to 
make the call, Megumi mumbled something.

&quot;No... no ambulance... no hospital... danger...&quot; Rei croaked out through 
parched lips.

Tsubasa stared incredulously at her. No ambulance? Was she delirious? 
She had to be wearing most of her body&#146;s supply of blood!

&quot;You need an ambulance Megumi, you&#39;ve lost a lot of blood!&quot; Tsubasa 
declared, as he looked at the girl uneasily, taking in her sickly pale 
face.

&quot;No... ambulance... I can take it... healing...&quot; the girl went on 
weakly.

Tsubasa cursed and then dashed into the bathroom, pulling out as many 
medical supplies as he could from the medicine cabinet. He knew first 
aid, but he was sure this was beyond his skill. When he returned, Megumi 
was moaning and crying out for someone, her feeble and begging voice 
pulling at his heartstrings. Tsubasa pointedly ignored her cries and set 
about trying to save her life.
