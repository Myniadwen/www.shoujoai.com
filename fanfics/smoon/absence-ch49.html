Makareus&#39; eyes followed his second in command as the youma paced back 
and forth in front of his desk, limping slightly and also appearing 
quite agitated, more than the demon had ever seen the usually 
unflappable Iason be in a very long time.

&quot;There must be a leak within our ranks,&quot; the youma stated with some mild 
force behind his voice, nodding to himself. &quot;The Sailor Senshi must have 
penetrated our organization and implanted a mole.&quot; He stopped his pacing 
and turned towards Makareus, the subordinate&#39;s black ponytail that was 
part of his human disguise swinging out in the air behind him. &quot;It is 
impossible, otherwise. How else could the humans know that I was coming? 
They were waiting for me, they even laid a trap, as pitiful as it were.&quot; 
Iason shook his head in incomprehension of the situation. &quot;And that&#39;s 
not even addressing the disaster with the Reaver infiltrator shock 
troops at Juuban High School,&quot; he added in distaste. &quot;We should put 
every youma to the question, no matter how high their position; hot 
pokers and sharp stakes will drive out the spy. I say let the 
inquisition section investigate, my Lord. In the meantime, I have 
cancelled the mission to attack Mizuno&#39;s living quarters until further 
notice; all subsequent operations are under threat until this breach is 
found.&quot;

Makareus said nothing, merely inhaling slowly and then releasing the 
breath in a silent puff of air. Perhaps it was time to replace his right 
hand youma. It seemed that the pressure was finally getting to the 
normally stoic Iason. To the casual observer, the creature dressed in a 
fresh indigo business suit appeared fairly calm, stating his 
observations and advice in a clear and concise manner. However, Makareus 
had known Iason for several Earth-time centuries and he could notice the 
subtle cracks in the youma&#39;s mask of indifference; the tense muscles 
beneath his crisp human clothing, the slight crease in his brow, the 
mild tightening around the eyes. Faint signs, yes, but on a youma like 
Iason, they screamed out to be spotted. Unless the creature was acting. 
Iason was devious --he had to be to survive in his high-ranking position 
in Makareus&#39; force-- and the youma had been known to execute 
diabolically complex plots to bring down potential rivals, most of which 
involved no small amount of subterfuge from Iason himself in the form of 
convincing theatrical performances. But of course, the youma couldn&#39;t 
compare to the master of deception himself. And Makareus&#39; finely tuned 
intuition told him that Iason was genuinely disconcerted.

The demon leaned back in his leather chair and began rapping the fingers 
of one hand on his hard wooden desk; the rhythmic hollow taps the only 
noise in the high-rise office as Iason waited somewhat patiently for his 
Lord&#39;s response, the youma aide fidgeting a little. This whole campaign 
was filled with mess after mess. Though, there were some successes; the 
deaths of his siblings and the subsequent phasing in of their followers 
into his own, and the acquirement of the interdimensional portal spell 
components, coming to Makareus&#39; mind. There had still been no word from 
his older brother, Thrinakie, thank the multiverse, and it was assumed 
that the old coot had either been killed in the explosion of his 
headquarters, or was lost in the ether that existed between dimensions 
when his pocket plane had collapsed; even an arch-mage of Thrinakie&#39;s 
calibre would have trouble escaping from such a void. But now, here was 
yet another setback. Even Makareus&#39; second in command had failed in his 
mission. And then there was the debacle with the Reavers; the demon knew 
he should have stuck with more delicate methods of dealing with the 
Sailor Senshi. Reports were still being collated, but so far the 
casualty list of the butchered humans at Juuban High School did not 
include any names of the stubborn enemy. Makareus narrowed his eyes to 
sinister slits and ceased his tapping on the desk. Why in all the planes 
wouldn&#39;t the blasted Sailor Senshi just die already? He had ordered the 
execution of an entire school building&#39;s population to be rid of them, 
with still no results. You couldn&#39;t even dispose of one who had been 
relatively incapacitated; it was like the group had been gifted with 
divine luck from the gods themselves. And speaking of which... Makareus 
tilted his head towards a dark corner of the office as he suddenly felt 
another presence in the room with him, besides his failure of a youma, 
Iason.

&quot;There is no need for an investigation,&quot; Lazarus the Night Haunter 
rasped from the corner he had materialised in, shrouded in shadow. 
&quot;There is no leak.&quot;

Iason turned sharply to the masked assassin, the black clad figure only 
visible in the gloom by his pale blue hair and the similarly coloured 
sash that hung from his waist. &quot;And how can you be so sure?&quot; the youma 
questioned, with a hint of contempt behind his words, no doubt irked 
that his deductions were being challenged, and in front of his Lord no 
less.

Lazarus lowered his head marginally, the light from the fluorescent 
tubes on the ceiling above giving his sky blue locks a slight sheen as 
he moved. &quot;My order is concerned predominantly with the art of murder... 
but we are just as capable at the art of intrigue,&quot; he informed Iason in 
his scratchy voice.

Makareus&#39; right hand youma looked at the chief assassin dispassionately. 
&quot;Sneaking behind our backs, are we?&quot; he accused coldly. &quot;Need I remind 
you who you take your commands from? The Silent Blades fall under Lord 
Makareus&#39; realm.&quot;

The Night Haunter was quiet for a moment, making the silence in the 
office all the more apparent. &quot;The Silent Blades follow *me*,&quot; Lazarus 
said finally, breaking the tension in the air. &quot;*I* am the 
representative of the high council in this world; *I* am the Blades&#39; 
leader on this plane. And *I* am the one who commands the order however 
I wish.&quot;

&quot;And you follow me,&quot; Makareus interrupted rather firmly, shifting his 
gaze to the impudent black clad youma. &quot;Your wishes epitomise my own.&quot;

Lazarus turned his head to the demon. &quot;Of course,&quot; he whispered gravely, 
not at all sounding subservient. The assassin&#39;s constant insolence was 
becoming tiresome to Makareus; one day the youma would have to learn his 
place. A mere youma was nothing compared to a demon spawned from the 
very essence of nightmares, no matter what the lowly creature&#39;s skills 
and/or powers.

&quot;But that still doesn&#39;t answer the question why you believe there isn&#39;t 
a Sailor Senshi spy within our midst,&quot; Iason said, narrowing his eyes 
slightly at the masked figure.

&quot;Some beings have a broader perspective on existence, on life, than 
others...&quot; Lazarus replied cryptically, giving no real answers 
whatsoever.

&quot;We lost almost a whole company of Reavers in the Juuban High School 
assault,&quot; Iason said, eyeing Lazarus icily for a second before facing 
Makareus, deciding to let the topic with the Silent Blades chief drop. 
&quot;The survivors are insisting that the Sailor Senshi had been ready for 
them, and reinforcements had arrived to aid the enemy momentarily.&quot; The 
youma paused for an instant, and then spoke in a level tone; &quot;They say 
that a Sailor Senshi with the power of the element of fire joined the 
fray and delivered a scorching and swift end to all who confronted her.&quot;

Makareus clenched one gloved fist tightly where it rested on his desk, 
causing a cracking sound to resonate around the room. Her again. Perhaps 
the rumours circulating around the youma army currently stationed in 
this dimension had more truth to them than the demon had realised. A 
Sailor Senshi that exhibited amazing displays of pyrotechnics from her 
bare hands, a single warrior whom death cannot touch. The demon shook 
his head; she was becoming a constant thorn in his side. There had 
always been so-called &#39;champions&#39; in the other dimensions and on the 
other planets Makareus had invaded, all possessing a great amount of 
&#39;heroism&#39; and astounding prowess in combat, but all had eventually 
fallen by an assassin&#39;s knife or on the battlefield, one way or another. 
All the champions bled, just like... *almost* everyone else. And this 
champion, this Sailor Senshi, was no different; she bled, which meant 
she would die, no matter how long her incredible lucky streak against 
his forces lasted. Lucky streak... Makareus returned his eyes to the 
Night Haunter, the assassin meeting his gaze through the dark eye slits 
gouged into his ghastly mask.

&quot;Lazarus...?&quot; the demon said, his orders implied.

&quot;I know who she is,&quot; the black clad youma said without inflection. &quot;I 
know her better than she knows herself.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Iason remarked coolly, rounding on the assassin. &quot;And you 
waited until *now* to inform us? When the damage has already been done?&quot;

&quot;...Yes,&quot; Lazarus replied simply in his usual monotone, making Iason 
noticeably glower at him. &quot;The warrior was the one responsible for 
destroying the majority of your agents&#39; party,&quot; the masked youma 
continued unperturbed, blatantly ignoring the other of his kind. &quot;Her 
*alone*. Her strength is formidable, and impressive, but all beings have 
their weaknesses. The human can fight, but she is flawed; she knows 
nothing.&quot;

&quot;Then take care of her,&quot; Makareus commanded sternly, not concerning 
himself too much with the Night Haunter&#39;s riddles; the masked creature 
had a tendency to spout them sometimes.

&quot;Yes...&quot; the assassin rasped. &quot;Now is the time for action; recent 
developments have made her vulnerable; the body can be strong, but the 
mind is stronger, though, no longer.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Developments&#39;?&quot; Iason questioned, but was summarily disregarded by 
Lazarus.

&quot;However...&quot; the Night Haunter went on. &quot;This... execution... must be 
carried out by *my* methods...&quot; He tilted his head languidly towards 
Makareus&#39; second in command. &quot;...Alone.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Makareus conceded, forestalling Iason&#39;s objections while 
placing his elbows on the desk and leaning forward in his chair. &quot;But 
make haste. I plan to open the main gate to our world in a matter of 
days.&quot;

Lazarus nodded grimly. &quot;First, I must have words with... *her*,&quot; he 
whispered, and then vanished in a cloud of black mist, melting into the 
shadows.

&quot;&#39;Words&#39;?&quot; Iason repeated with some disdain once the assassin was gone.

Makareus was silent, pondering what his future actions should be. 
Perhaps a couple of days wait before he activated the portal. It would 
be a risk, but if the Night Haunter were successful in ridding the demon 
of that one annoying Sailor Senshi, and if the master of deception 
brought all of his now small amount of remaining troops in this world 
with him, then maybe that would be enough to keep the surviving 
defenders of Earth at bay while an invasion legion from the gate secured 
his stranglehold on the planet, and the dimension. Perhaps he wouldn&#39;t 
even need to draw his blade. But in the meantime, the safest and wisest 
action for Makareus was to wait.

******

&quot;I think that&#39;s everything,&quot; Rei said quietly, putting in one of her 
skirts in her bag, the final item of her clothing to be packed away. She 
slowly zipped up the bag on Usagi&#39;s bed and glanced at her princess who 
was sitting on the edge demurely, having been watching the miko 
despondently as the girl collected her belongings from around the 
bedroom and put them away for the last time.

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Usagi replied in a just as subdued tone, looking at the full 
bag. &quot;I guess so.&quot;

Rei had deemed it best if she moved out as soon as possible from the 
Tsukino house, despite her love&#39;s protests to the contrary. Usagi had 
argued that the youma enemy knew the Fire Senshi&#39;s identity, and she was 
in danger if she returned to the Hikawa Jinja. But Rei was certain that 
if the youma did in fact know where she lived, they would have taken 
some sort of action by now, and so far it had been peaceful at the 
shrine. Besides, the raven-haired girl didn&#39;t think she could stand 
living with Usagi for even a moment longer, youma threat or not. It 
wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t enjoy her princess&#39;s company, far from it, but it 
simply hurt to be around the girl so often, morning and night. And noon 
also, now that Juuban High School was closed for the foreseeable future 
in the aftermath of the youma attack; Usagi had no school to attend 
until a replacement facility was allocated. Rei had sworn to endure the 
torture of never being with Usagi again, but the pain was still fresh, 
and she just couldn&#39;t take being so near to her true love and not be 
able to touch her, to kiss her, to show affection for the beautiful 
blonde. It was basically too much to bear so soon. While Usagi had 
chosen Mamoru over her, Rei&#39;s love for her princess had not diminished 
in the slightest, and the Senshi of Fire doubted it ever would, despite 
the eternity of loneliness that would fill her life in the future. 
However, the pain in the miko&#39;s broken heart would eventually fade away, 
the raven-haired girl was sure of it... or at least, she hoped it would. 
But in the back of Rei&#39;s mind, she knew the torment of not being 
together with Usagi would always linger inside her; the pain was 
permanently ingrained in her heart and soul.

The Fire Senshi sighed deeply and straightened from her bag, taking a 
step back and being careful not to trip over the futon that lay beside 
the bed. After parting Setsuna&#39;s company, Rei had slept on the floor 
instead of in the bed beside her princess last night, which had been 
rather fitting in a way; the first night she had spent at the blonde&#39;s 
house since returning to Tokyo she had slept on the floor, and now the 
final night in the girl&#39;s bedroom she had used the futon also. Usagi had 
said it was okay for her bodyguard to join her under the covers of her 
bed, but the Senshi of Fire had opted not to. While Rei was experiencing 
pain, she hadn&#39;t forgotten that her love was just as much hurt by the 
turnout of events also, and any reminders of what the blonde and the 
miko had had together threatened to increase Usagi&#39;s suffering, which 
the Fire Senshi wanted to avoid. Rei lowered her gaze to the floor. All 
the more reason to return to the Hikawa Jinja immediately.

&quot;Well, I better get going,&quot; Rei said, giving Usagi a smile for the 
girl&#39;s benefit, even though it was strained. &quot;Grandpa and Yuuichirou 
will be glad to have me back to help out around the shrine.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll be glad to just have you back,&quot; Usagi corrected softly, keeping 
her eyes averted from her senshi standing in front of her.

Rei&#39;s forced smile fell from her features as the rest of her expression 
followed suit. The Senshi of Fire would never forgive herself for 
causing her princess all this heartache, but in retrospect, she supposed 
it had been inevitable for her feelings for Usagi to come out 
eventually. But the raven-haired girl wished it had all resulted in a 
less painful decision for her love. Rei started to reach out a hand on 
reflex to comfort her princess, but then quickly let it drop. No, it was 
still too early for things like that. Someday the two girls would get 
back their previous close friendship, but today was not that day.

&quot;They&#39;re withering away,&quot; Usagi said out of the blue, catching the 
miko&#39;s attention. Rei followed her princess&#39;s gaze towards the large 
bouquet of carnations, which had been a gift from the Fire Senshi. The 
flowers were arranged in a vase on the low square table in the blonde&#39;s 
bedroom, but the once bright and vibrant pink petals were now marred by 
brown decay. &quot;I regularly changed their water, but they&#39;re still dying,&quot; 
Usagi went on, continuing to look dejectedly at the carnations.

Rei gazed at the pink flowers, the once pretty bouquet bringing back 
memories mixed with sadness. &quot;No...&quot; she replied quietly, &quot;they&#39;re 
already dead.&quot;

Usagi turned away from the carnations and raised her head to look up at 
her bodyguard, appearing crestfallen and on the verge of tears. The 
Senshi of Fire merely reached for her bag on the bed and picked it up. 
It was far past time to leave.

&quot;Do you... do you need help with that?&quot; Usagi asked as Rei&#39;s arm 
trembled slightly under the weight of her full bag, her injured forearm 
causing her difficulty.

&quot;It&#39;s alright; I&#39;m fine,&quot; the Fire Senshi assured her princess with a 
faint but genuine smile this time, ignoring the twinges of pain that 
shot up her limb as she withheld a wince. Usagi merely nodded in reply, 
eyeing her bodyguard as if she didn&#39;t believe her.

Rei grabbed her long black coat with her free hand and then left Usagi&#39;s 
bedroom, before walking down the stairs to the front door, the blonde 
following solemnly behind her. It was fairly sunny outside, but the 
Senshi of Fire had decided to wear her coat anyway. There was a chill in 
the air.

&quot;Oh, Rei? Are you leaving us?&quot; Ikuko inquired, meeting her daughter and 
the girl&#39;s best friend near the front door.

&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; Rei answered. &quot;I really should go back to the Hikawa Jinja 
and return to my miko duties,&quot; she added, trying to inject a bit of life 
into her tone. She wasn&#39;t sure if she succeeded or not.

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s too bad,&quot; Ikuko replied regretfully. &quot;But you did have to go 
back home eventually, I suppose. I&#39;ve just gotten so used to having you 
around!&quot; she went on, smiling pleasantly at Rei.

&quot;Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. Tsukino,&quot; the Senshi of Fire said 
politely, bowing to the woman. &quot;Please extend my gratitude to Mr. 
Tsukino also.&quot;

&quot;It was a pleasure, dear,&quot; Ikuko said, nodding to the girl. &quot;I only wish 
your manners had rubbed off on Usagi,&quot; she added, glancing discreetly at 
her daughter for the blonde girl&#146;s reaction. However, Usagi&#39;s thoughts 
seemed miles away, preoccupied with other things.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei said again, bowing once more.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome to stay anytime you want to, Rei,&quot; Ikuko offered as the 
raven-haired girl put down her bag and put on her shoes. The woman put a 
contemplative finger on her chin and appeared thoughtful. &quot;Kenji might 
not like the idea too much, but I&#39;m sure that once I talk to him he&#39;ll 
see things my way. You are my daughter&#39;s girlfriend after all!&quot;

Usagi noticeably stiffened at her mother&#39;s words, but remained silent. 
Rei took it all in passively on the outside, but she couldn&#39;t help the 
mild stab of hurt that pierced her heart at the reminder of what had 
been, and could be no longer. The miko finished putting on her shoes and 
slipped on her long coat, the feeling of the dark clothing on her body a 
comforting weight, like a protective shield.

&quot;Bye, Mrs. Tsukino,&quot; Rei farewelled, choosing not to tell Ikuko that she 
wasn&#39;t her daughter&#39;s girlfriend anymore, not wishing to get embroiled 
in the subject of the why. &quot;Goodbye, Usagi,&quot; the Fire Senshi then said, 
picking up her bag as she did so. Usagi didn&#39;t respond. Rei left the 
house, not sparing a masochistic glance back at her love. That chapter 
of her life was over, and it was time to try and let go and move on.

******

Rei lay on her back like a lifeless lump on her futon in her room at the 
Hikawa Jinja, staring up at the ceiling through flat, dull lavender eyes 
rimmed with dark circles, her raven locks spread out around her head. 
She felt tired, and her wounds ached, but her mind registered these 
facts numbly, barely even concerned. She wanted to cry, to try and let 
all the sorrowful emotions out of her heart, perhaps giving her some 
respite from her pain, no matter how brief. But what was the point. 
Tears served no purpose, and she had already shed a river of them in her 
life. Rei knew she was just feeling sorry for herself, wallowing in 
self-pity, and a part of her hated her for it, but try as she might, the 
senshi just couldn&#39;t muster up the will to do anything else. Time, 
that&#39;s all the miko needed. Time and space. Space... a stray idea ran 
around in Rei&#39;s mind that told her to leave Tokyo once more, this time 
truly for good, but the raven-haired girl snuffed out the thought. That 
was something she would never do again; abandon her princess. The only 
time Rei would leave Usagi is when Death claimed her... but the Fire 
Senshi was cursed with an immortal life. Perhaps all this was a 
punishment for challenging Fate.

Rei angled her dead gaze downwards, looking at the picture on her desk 
of her and Usagi, smiling happily. A good memory... but that was all Rei 
had now, memories of a better time. She sighed resignedly. She really 
should change out of her clothes and into her Chihaya and Hibakama that 
made up her traditional miko garb. Preforming her duties around the 
shrine might take her mind off things.

There was a light knock on Rei&#39;s bedroom door, and the raven-haired girl 
grunted out a wordless acknowledgement to enter. The sliding door 
opened, revealing her Grandpa, smiling cheerfully as usual.

&quot;Hello, Rei!&quot; he greeted. &quot;Taking a day off from school, I see. Well, I 
suppose that&#39;s reasonable; you look like you&#39;ve been getting into more 
scuffles.&quot; He frowned slightly in disapproval. &quot;I don&#39;t want you taking 
unnecessary risks, Rei. Tokyo isn&#39;t always the safest of places.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; the miko answered absently, returning her eyes to the ceiling, 
not really paying attention.

Rei heard her grandfather sigh and shuffle into the room, sliding the 
door closed behind him. &quot;How was your stay with Usagi?&quot; the old man 
asked carefully after a moment.

&quot;Good... while it lasted,&quot; Rei replied sadly, blinking up at the 
ceiling.

The miko heard her Grandpa sigh again. &quot;Did you and Usagi have a falling 
out?&quot; he questioned in a kind voice.

&quot;You could say that,&quot; the Senshi of Fire said forlornly. &quot;One that lasts 
an eternity.&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot; the raven-haired girl&#39;s Grandpa said patiently. &quot;Don&#39;t be so 
sad. Usagi&#39;s a nice, easygoing girl; I&#39;m sure the two of you will make 
up soon enough.&quot;

Rei shook her head from where she lay on the futon. &quot;No... not this 
time.&quot;

Her grandfather was quiet for a brief instant. &quot;Oh...&quot; he then said, as 
if something had dawned on him. &quot;I see,&quot; he went on, the tone of his 
voice turning compassionate. &quot;Rei... sometimes in life, not everything 
turns out the way you want. We may not like it, but that&#39;s just the way 
things are. But without these challenges, life would be pointless, 
meaningless. Without knowing hardship, how can we know and enjoy the 
wonderful things when they come along?&quot; Rei heard her Grandpa move away 
from her, and cross the room back to the bedroom door. &quot;What matters is 
what you *do* after these setbacks,&quot; he continued. &quot;Do you let each 
disappointment hold you back, or do you struggle onwards?&quot; The Fire 
Senshi&#39;s grandfather smiled sadly at his granddaughter as he slid the 
door open, about to depart. &quot;Remember, Rei,&quot; he said. &quot;Even unrequited 
love is nourishment for the soul.&quot;

Rei sat up abruptly as her Grandpa left the room and closed the door, 
the man&#39;s parting words of wisdom responsible for the girl&#39;s surprise. 
Her grandfather&#39;s advice was awfully pointed. How did he know about her 
and Usagi? The miko hadn&#39;t told him about the previous change in their 
relationship, and she hadn&#39;t even been around him when she and Usagi had 
been together. Rei blushed bright red as the implications of her 
grandfather&#39;s apparent knowledge finally hit her. How long had her 
Grandpa known about her more than friendly feelings for her best friend? 
All those innocuous little smiles he gave the miko when she told him 
Usagi were coming over suddenly took on whole new meanings. Well, at 
least it didn&#39;t appear as if he were angry with Rei for keeping her love 
secret, or for her choices in life.

Rei&#146;s inner thoughts were disturbed as the sound of music filtered in 
through an open window, a guitar to be precise, accompanied by rather 
strangled, and morose, singing. On an impulse, Rei lethargically got her 
body to its feet and followed the noise, leaving her bedroom and walking 
around to the back of the Hikawa Jinja. She spotted Yuuichirou sitting 
on some steps strumming away on his guitar, while attempting to sing a 
depressing song. The miko wondered if the man was feeling any better 
after what had happened between them, or rather, what hadn&#39;t happened.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Rei said as she approached Yuuichirou, taking a seat on the other 
side of the steps and leaning up against a wooden support beam.

&quot;Oh, hi, Rei,&quot; Yuuichirou greeted a little uneasily, ceasing his singing 
and slapping his hand over the guitar strings, silencing the instrument. 
&quot;Do you want me to &#39;shut up&#39; this &#39;racket&#39;?&quot;

The Fire Senshi shook her head gently in the negative while gazing out 
towards the lush forest located behind the shrine. &quot;Sing me a song,&quot; she 
requested instead.

Yuuichirou looked at Rei uncertainly for a few moments, but the girl 
said nothing more, merely looking out into the surrounding foliage with 
slightly glazed over eyes, watching a sprinkle of pinkish cherry 
blossoms float to the ground. The man eventually decided to abide by the 
miko&#39;s wish. After clearing his throat and plucking his guitar strings 
several times, he started to perform a melody. It was melancholy, 
something about love and loss and moving on, which had been Yuuichirou&#39;s 
running theme these days.

Rei let the lyrics wash over her as her mind wandered, thinking back on 
her Grandpa&#39;s words. He was right; what was she going to do? Was she 
merely going to sit back and let self-pity consume her until the pain 
gradually left her, letting time attempt to heal her deep wounds? The 
Senshi of Fire wasn&#39;t like that, or at least, she didn&#39;t want to be. She 
was a fighter; it was in her very nature to fight. Rei&#39;s spirit had been 
dealt a crushing blow, but not a lethal one; there was still a flicker 
of defiance there, along with the hurt. And the miko would nurture that 
glimmer of will back to its normal blazing ferocity; she wouldn&#39;t let 
the torment in her heart and soul control her life. The pain would 
always be with her, it was her duty to bear it, but it was nothing she 
wouldn&#39;t be able to handle. Loneliness was her future, her destiny, but 
it didn&#39;t matter; Rei had gotten what she had desired, what she had 
wanted. Usagi was happy. All that was left for the senshi to do now was 
to carry out her duty to her princess for the rest of time. She wouldn&#39;t 
be like Setsuna, hoping against hope for a better existence when there 
wasn&#39;t any possibility of one. Besides, this current existence was 
perfectly fine. Rei would still be able to see Usagi, forever. And her 
love&#39;s smiles wouldn&#39;t lose their lustre; her bright blue eyes wouldn&#39;t 
lose that endearing and beautiful sparkle; and Usagi herself wouldn&#39;t 
lose her kind and compassionate spirit. Rei&#39;s perspective to her true 
love may have changed, it may have become more distance, but it didn&#39;t 
really matter. The Fire Senshi pulled the long black coat around her 
tightly with both hands, having never taken off the garment when she had 
returned to the Hikawa Jinja. Duty was her life, as it had always been; 
there would be no wishing for something more with Usagi. It was 
impossible and useless, only causing the raven-haired girl&#39;s already 
substantial pain to heighten unnecessarily.

Ah, atatakaku, sotto yashashiku
~Ah, now that warmly, so tenderly~
yomigaeru kaze wa
~reawakened breeze~
ima hitori sora wo mitsumeteru
~keeps gazing at the lonely sky~
[boku] ni hohoendeiru
~and smiling down on me~
mada ano hi no mama no mabushisa de
~still with the same radiance it had on that day;~
te wo futteiru
~I keep waving my hand~
[kimi] wa everlasting memory
~you are my everlasting memory.~

Rei took a long, deep breath, and then let it out slowly as Yuuichirou&#39;s 
song began to wind down to its conclusion. The miko smirked; the man 
wasn&#39;t that bad of a singer after all. As Yuuichirou sang out the last 
few lines and played the last few chords, Rei felt a new feeling take 
over her. An empty, desolate feeling, but one that also contained a 
mixture of mild contentment and relief. Rei looked up at the blue sky, 
watching wisps of clouds steadily cross the heavens above. So this was 
letting go.
