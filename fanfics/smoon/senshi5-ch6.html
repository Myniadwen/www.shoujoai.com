<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 6 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        Rei turned as her Grandfather called out to her, &quot;Could you 
come here, Rei?&quot;

        Rei was about to say no, when she saw the intense look on his 
face. She turned back to Usagi, &quot;Give me a few minutes.&quot;

        &quot;Just make it fast,&quot; Usagi said seriously.

        With a slight frown Rei followed him as he lead her inside the 
shrine, and felt a bit surprise as he drew out a traditional bow and 
arrows, different from the ones she had practiced with in school. The 
bow was old, but still supple, and by the feel of it would draw 
smoothly. Her fingers tingled as she handled the arrows, a sensation 
that was oddly familiar to her, somehow.

        &quot;What are they?&quot; Rei murmured softly.

        &quot;This bow has been passed down through the generations,&quot; 
Grandfather said seriously, &quot;until the time was right for them to be 
used.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;I think that time is now.&quot;

        Rei stringed the bow, sliding an arrow into place then drawing 
smoothly. It felt right, as if she was born to use it. &quot;Thank you, 
Grandfather,&quot; she eased back, returning the arrow to it&#39;s quiver. She 
tied it to her side, resting the bow across her shoulders.

        As Rei was leaving he said, &quot;Help Usagi however you can, but 
you must remember this,&quot; he paused, &quot;the darkness must be stopped, 
whatever the cost.&quot;

        Rei didn&#39;t look back at him as she answered, &quot;I know.&quot;

        Outside Makoto raised an eyebrow as Ami hefted a blue 
carrybag, slinging it over her shoulder. &quot;What&#39;s in there?&quot; she asked 
Ami curiously.

        &quot;My personal computer,&quot; Ami smiled as she adjusted the bad 
nervously, &quot;and a few devices that might come in handy against the 
Youma.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re an inventor?&quot; Makoto asked eagerly.

        Ami blushed, &quot;No, nothing so grand as that.&quot; She looked away 
uncomfortably, &quot;I&#39;m just an bit of a tinkerer, is all.&quot;

        &quot;I wish you had let me try to get more information out of 
Artemis,&quot; Luna sat on the wall in her human form, staring out into the 
twilight.

        &quot;You mind explaining what you meant by calling him a traitor?&quot; 
Usagi tried asking a question of her own as they waited.

        Surprisingly Luna answered her, &quot;Artemis fled our clan after 
stealing a weapon of power, one almost as dangerous as your katana. He 
believed the Chain of Justice should go to another, that we were wrong 
about whom the prophecy described as the chosen.&quot;

        &quot;So who were you going to give this chain to?&quot; Usagi asked.

        &quot;It does not matter,&quot; Luna shook her head sadly, &quot;you see the 
Youma slew her before I could try to save her.&quot;

        &quot;Another life that the Youma must pay for,&quot; Usagi murmured.

        Rei stepped from the shadows, her long hair flowing around her 
like a cape. &quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; she said to them with a smile.

        Usagi didn&#39;t comment on the bow, they just walked towards 
where Makoto and Ami were quietly talking. Luna shifted to her cat 
form, bouncing up onto Usagi&#39;s shoulder.

        &quot;Nice weapon,&quot; Makoto nodded as she got to her feet.

        From her bag Ami drew out what almost looked like a pistol, 
carefully checking it over before putting it back inside. &quot;So what do 
we do now?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;I try to find the Youma again,&quot; Rei said with a grim smile.

        What Artemis had said to Rei still stung, that she hadn&#39;t been 
trying hard enough. She closed her eyes, reaching out with her senses. 
She ignored the now familiar presence of Usagi and the others, pushing 
outward with her will. It was strange, but carrying the bow seemed to 
make it easier, her senses stretching out to cover the neighborhood, 
then a part of the city, and finally she hit a limit, most of the city 
within her range.

        Usagi&#39;s eyes widened as a trickle of blood ran down from Rei&#39;s 
nose, the miko swaying gently. Ami moved to help but Usagi stopped 
her, unsure if they should interfere.

        &quot;The Youma are in the city,&quot; Rei said, her voice coming out 
harshly, &quot;one group is at the hospital. The other is at the amusement 
park.&quot;

        &quot;Gathering life force,&quot; Usagi scowled, &quot;we&#39;ve got to stop 
them.&quot;

        &quot;Then we&#39;d better split up,&quot; Makoto said, giving Ami a 
cautious glance as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll take Ami over to the amusement 
park.&quot;

        Usagi tried not to smile at the intense blush that appeared on 
Ami&#39;s face. Still, the professor didn&#39;t actually protest it at all. 
&quot;Then I guess Rei and I will head out to the hospital,&quot; she said 
firmly. She looked over at Luna, &quot;You&#39;re going with them.&quot;

        &quot;But Mistress!&quot; Luna protested.

        &quot;You&#39;re going with them,&quot; Usagi repeated much more firmly.

        &quot;Yes, Mistress,&quot; Luna bowed gracefully.

        &quot;Before you go,&quot; Ami rummaged around in her bag before tossing 
something to Usagi. It looked like an oversized wristwatch, but it had 
a few extra buttons on the side. Usagi touched one, and the face 
popped up to reveal microphone mesh.

        &quot;Radios?&quot; Usagi ventured as she put it on.

        &quot;Something I threw together in my spare time,&quot; Ami said as she 
strapped one on her arm. &quot;At least this way both groups can stay in 
touch with each other,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Thanks, Ami,&quot; Rei called over her shoulder as both groups 
took off.

        The bus got Usagi and Rei to the hospital quickly, and if any 
of the other passengers saw the katana or bow, they didn&#39;t remark on 
it. They ran towards the entrance and Usagi asked, &quot;are you picking up 
anything?&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s more than one in there,&quot; Rei scowled, &quot;but I&#39;m not 
sure how many exactly.&quot;

        Usagi didn&#39;t answer, just lead the way into the admissions 
area. A nurse worked at one of the desks, and patients sat in the 
chairs, but something felt off, somehow. Rei froze, then drew back her 
bow and aimed at the nurse even as Usagi gasped, &quot;Wait a..&quot;

        Thwack!

        The arrow struck dead center, and the nurse staggered. But she 
did not fall, instead her body expanded, skin growing leathery, 
revealing the Youma within. The arrow began to glow, and the Youma 
looked down in surprise... right before it exploded into flames!

        The patients fled in a panic, even as Rei looked at the 
burning Youma then down at her bow. &quot;I&#39;ve never had an arrow do that 
before,&quot; she murmured.

        &quot;Nice,&quot; Usagi smiled ruefully, &quot;but could you tell me, next 
time?&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Rei murmured. Her eyes were glazed, clearly she was 
trying to sense more Youma. She stiffened, &quot;They&#39;re going after the 
babies!&quot; She took off at a run, Usagi right beside her.

        A Youma tried to stop them and Usagi struck, a single sweep of 
her blade leaving it a bloody mess o the floor. Just ahead five female 
Youma guarded a door, stiffening as they saw them coming. &quot;Move 
aside,&quot; Usagi pointed with her sword even as Rei drew her bow again.

        &quot;Who are you that commands the Doom and Gloom girls?&quot; the 
leader demanded.

        &quot;Usagi Tsukino.&quot;

        The leader&#39;s eyes widened, then she exchanged glances with the 
others. Surprisingly, they moved aside as she said, &quot;Malachite awaits 
beyond, and he is sure to slay you.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;But if you do 
triumph, remember us when you come into your own, sweet Princess.&quot;

        &quot;I am getting very tired of people calling me that,&quot; Usagi 
grumbled.

        As they went by the girls Rei asked Usagi, &quot;We&#39;re letting them 
live?&quot;

        With a grim little smile Usagi answered &quot;First we get to face 
Malachite. If we actually win, we can track those five down later.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Rei agreed as they strode onward.
