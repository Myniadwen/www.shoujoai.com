&quot;...So, in conclusion, we have narrowed Kino&#39;s... associates, down to 
four individuals: Minako Aino, Ami Mizuno, and Usagi Tsukino. All of 
who, I might add, have been frequently absent from Juuban High School 
during the last two-week period, &quot; reported Iason to Makareus, the youma 
occasionally glancing at the clipboard in his hands. &quot;It is my opinion 
that the aforementioned humans are Sailor Senshi, or at the very least, 
affiliated with the group, and can be used for hostage or morale 
lowering purposes.&quot; The creature paused, and then looked expectantly at 
his master. &quot;Your orders, my Lord...?&quot;

Makareus leaned back in the leather chair behind his desk, contemplating 
the new information he had just received. He finally had them. The 
Sailors were in the palm of his hand; all he had to do was close his 
fingers. The demon smiled coldly. Close his fingers, and crush them 
without mercy. There could be no more mistakes; this operation had cost 
far too many resources already, even though Makareus had gained his late 
siblings entire empires in the process. The creature had the necessary 
components to open the largest interdimensional gateway into this world, 
and also the knowledge of how to actually preform the spell, which had 
been graciously given to him by Thrinakie&#39;s former followers. Once the 
gate was opened, the planet was doomed. The Sailor Senshi were too few; 
they would all be overwhelmed in moments, no matter how skilful the 
defenders were in battle; a handful of humans would never be able to 
stand against a legion of youma invaders.

However, the procedure to open the portal was tricky, and not at all 
subtle. Once Makareus began, it would draw the Sailor Senshi right to 
him and threaten to disrupt the spell. He couldn&#39;t allow that risk. The 
Sailors had to be dealt with before the demon attempted to open the 
gate. Even if only a few senshi were killed or crippled, it would be 
enough. The location of the gate was easily defendable if only two or 
three senshi were able to fight. Makareus nodded to himself. He could 
not afford any more fowl-ups.

&quot;Kill them all. I want them all in their graves,&quot; the demon said to 
Iason. He angled his head slightly to one side. &quot;Bring back their 
heads,&quot; he added as an afterthought. Makareus didn&#39;t want any of the 
Sailor Senshi supposedly vanquished coming &#39;back from the dead&#39;. The 
demon frowned marginally at the thought. He still hadn&#39;t been able to 
completely stop all the rumours in his youma ranks about the lone 
warrior who slew Khairephon. And with what had happened at Thrinakie&#39;s 
headquarters, he didn&#39;t fancy his chances that he would be anymore 
successful in the future. Perhaps his followers&#39; minds would be put at 
ease if he showed the severed heads of the enemy to them. &quot;Attack them 
at their place of learning... let them learn pain...&quot;

&quot;Of course, my Lord,&quot; replied Iason crisply. &quot;However, tomorrow, most of 
the agents will not be at Juuban High School. It is not a full school 
day; therefore a surprise attack will not be at its most effective 
level. I suggest we wait until the start of a new school week.&quot; The 
youma flicked through some pages on his clipboard. &quot;That will be... 
Monday.&quot; Humans had such odd names for their planet&#39;s revolution cycles.

&quot;Then Monday it is,&quot; Makareus responded. He stood up from his chair and 
looked at Iason sternly. &quot;This mission cannot fail,&quot; the demon began, &quot;I 
want all the senshi in the ground! Butcher the entire class if you have 
to, the whole school! Tell the youma to paint Juuban High School&#39;s walls 
red with human blood!&quot; It would be a sloppy mission, not Makareus&#39; usual 
elegant methods, and in broad daylight no less. But enough was enough. 
Perhaps the demon&#39;s deceased berserker brother had been on to something 
with the overkill approach. &quot;And once the Sailor Senshi are dead...&quot; 
Makareus went on, his fervour ebbing, &quot;hunt down and execute their 
families and their friends. *Anybody* who has come into contact with 
them. I don&#39;t care how you do it, just do it!&quot;

Iason bowed deeply, unaffected by his master&#39;s tone. &quot;As you wish, my 
Lord.&quot;

&quot;One more thing,&quot; Makareus said as the youma turned to leave. &quot;Makoto 
Kino... while the mission at Juuban High School is underway, I want 
*you* to put the Sailor to death. She has been left alone long enough.&quot;

Iason blinked once at the demon, the only sign of confusion that could 
be seen from the youma. &quot;Me, my Lord?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I want you to personally dispose of her. If anyone else even so 
much as approaches you, kill them,&quot; Makareus ordered.

&quot;Very well, my Lord,&quot; Iason said, bowing once more before leaving the 
office.

Makareus watched his right-hand youma exit, the creature shutting the 
door behind him. Iason would not fail. It was a simple job after all. 
Makareus turned around and walked over to the window, taking in the view 
of Tokyo at night. It would all be over soon. His black eyes moved over 
to the tall tower, which functioned as a human communication station. At 
night, the steel structure was illuminated by many floodlights, making 
it easy to spot in the Tokyo skyline. Yes, when the interdimensional 
portal started to open, it would not be subtle at all. Makareus usually 
tried to avoid direct confrontations, but he would definitely have to 
take a hand in things during the casting of the spell.

The grey-suited man&#39;s image shimmered for a second, like a mirage in a 
scorched desert, and was replaced by a tall humanoid figure shrouded in 
a jet black darker than darkness itself. Makareus touched his sword&#39;s 
pommel beneath his cloak. It had been eons since he had spilt blood with 
his own blade, and the weapon now madly craved the taste of flesh. He 
moved his black-gloved hand down to the scabbard, and using his thumb, 
pushed upwards on the hilt of the sword, revealing the slightly curved 
dark metal blade, sharp as ever. Despite the light from the fluorescent 
tubes on the ceiling, the blade did not shine, but instead seemed to 
absorb the light around it. Makareus smiled grimly as he saw countless 
faces swim inside the dark steel, the souls of those he had slain before 
trapped for eternity in the metal&#39;s evil embrace.

The grandmaster swordsman stroked the blade lovingly, watching the 
tormented visages flee from his touch. Those souls would soon have new 
companions...

Rei stared into the mirror on Usagi&#39;s dressing table, putting the 
finishing touches on her make-up. The table at the restaurant was booked 
for eight and it was almost time to leave. Rei and Usagi couldn&#39;t afford 
to miss getting their table; it had been sheer luck the miko had managed 
to reserve a table in the first place. The raven-haired girl hadn&#39;t told 
her princess what restaurant they were going to yet, but it was highly 
unlikely that anybody the girls knew would be eating there. Marche aux 
Vins Yamada was a very high-class French restaurant that would probably 
clean out Rei&#39;s bank account in one sitting... but it was only money.

Luna leapt onto the dressing table, the cat startling the Fire Senshi 
and almost making the girl stab her own eyeball with the eyeliner. Rei 
spared the feline an irritated glare before she resumed applying her 
make-up. She could still hear the shower outside Usagi&#39;s open bedroom 
door; the blonde still hadn&#39;t finished getting ready yet. Usagi had 
better hurry up or they were going to be late.

&quot;Just for the record, I heartily object to this- this date!&quot; Luna 
declared vehemently, raising her furry chin for added effect.

&quot;Well thankfully no one cares,&quot; Rei said rudely, not breaking her gaze 
from the mirror as she put down the black pencil and picked up a dark 
red lipstick.

The black feline spluttered indignantly for a few seconds, and then 
visibly calmed herself. &quot;I&#39;m sure Mamoru would care if I told him...&quot; 
she said carefully.

Rei finished applying her lipstick and smacked her lips together. She 
picked up a tissue and put it between her lips for blotting. She pressed 
down on the tissue, leaving dark red semi circles on both sides of the 
soft tissue paper. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; the Fire Senshi stated 
simply, balling up the tissue and throwing it in a wastebasket near the 
dressing table.

Luna lowered her head, muttering to herself. She knew the girl&#39;s words 
were true. Telling Mamoru would be a disaster. Rei bent down and kissed 
the air in front of the black cat&#39;s face, causing the feline to flinch 
backwards. &quot;You should be happy for us,&quot; the miko said cheerfully.

Luna raised her head sharply. &quot;&#39;Happy&#39;? How can I be happy?? You&#39;re 
threatening the Earth&#39;s entire future!&quot; she cried, scandalised.

Rei shrugged her shoulders, completely unconcerned. &quot;Yeah, I guess,&quot; she 
said absently while she sorted her long hair, looking into the mirror. 
She had idly considered doing something different with it, but had 
decided just to let it hang loose down her back like she always did.

&quot;What?! Is that all you have to say??&quot; Luna wailed in disbelief. The cat 
then sighed and shook her furry head. &quot;What happened to you, Rei? You 
used to be so responsible, so level-headed...&quot;

The Senshi of Fire turned away from the mirror and faced Luna. &quot;All 
things change. You shouldn&#39;t be afraid of it.&quot;

&quot;I am when it&#39;s for the worse!&quot; the feline shouted.

Rei waved a hand at Luna, dismissing the cat from her mind. The Fire 
Senshi looked down at herself. She had picked a rather... daring, dress 
to wear for tonight. It was one she had bought quite a while ago on an 
impulse but had never had the courage to wear it in public. It was long, 
reaching down to the miko&#39;s ankles, and was silky smooth, clinging to 
her body delightfully and accentuating her curves. The dress was held up 
by two thin straps and showed off quite an ample display of cleavage. Up 
the right hand side was a long slit all the way to Rei&#39;s upper thigh, 
revealing a lot of skin. The raven-haired girl was thankful Sailor 
Senshi healed so fast or there would be no way she could have worn the 
outfit. The material was coloured a deep black but due to the satin 
fabric, it reflected the light in some places. Oddly, Rei&#39;s first 
instinct was to wear something black, rather than her favourite colour, 
red. Sure, black was also a favourite of hers, but it had always been 
second to red; it was the colour of Mars after all. Rei supposed it 
didn&#39;t really matter, as long as Usagi liked her appearance.

&quot;Why are you all dressed up for?&quot;

Rei looked to the bedroom&#39;s doorway and saw Chibi-Usa standing there. 
The young girl had come through her ordeal with the youma relatively 
unscathed and had returned to the Tsukino residence, the family none the 
wiser of where the child had really been. Usagi&#39;s parents and brother 
all believed Chibi-Usa had been staying over at Hotaru&#39;s house for the 
past few days.

Rei forced back the feelings of hopelessness that began to creep into 
her mind when she saw the reminder of Mamoru and Usagi&#39;s future. Nothing 
was going to stop her winning her princess&#39;s love, nothing! The Fire 
Senshi would crush fate beneath her heel at all costs. Rei nodded grimly 
to herself. All or nothing. She would win.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Chibi-Usa questioned, looking at the raven-haired girl as she 
stared into space, the senshi&#39;s features twisted into an intense 
expression.

Rei blinked a few times and refocused her attention on the pink-haired 
girl. &quot;What?&quot; she said, her mind coming back to reality.

&quot;I said, why are you dressed like that?&quot; Chibi-Usa repeated.

Rei glanced down at her dress, then back at the young girl. &quot;Oh. Usagi 
and I are going out tonight,&quot; she said.

&quot;Is Mamoru going too?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked.

&quot;Nope, it&#39;s just me and Usagi,&quot; Rei sighed dreamily, staring off into 
the distance.

&quot;Are you going some place special? Is that why you&#39;re dressed up?&quot; 
Chibi-Usa continued to question.

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; the Senshi of Fire murmured absently, lost in thoughts about 
her princess. She really should have gotten her true love a gift or more 
flowers, but she couldn&#39;t afford it since they were going to such an 
expensive restaurant. There was always next time.

&quot;Uh... have fun, I guess...&quot; Chibi-Usa said, and then hurried away from 
Rei, her weird behaviour disturbing the young pink-haired girl somewhat.

&quot;I will,&quot; Rei said, and then snapped out of her thoughts as she heard 
Chibi-Usa&#39;s feet clomp down the stairs. The miko should probably go 
downstairs to wait for Usagi.

The Senshi of Fire walked up to the chair beside the dressing table and 
reached out to pick up her long black coat, which was draped over it. 
Her hand froze halfway in motion as she realised what she was doing. 
Sure, it was night and no doubt chilly outside, but she didn&#39;t need the 
coat. That was for when she was heading into battle. But wasn&#39;t she 
constantly fighting a battle, right at this very moment? Fate was her 
perpetual adversary. Rei shook her head as she looked down at the black 
coat. She could almost smell the scent of dried blood on it. The 
raven-haired girl turned away from the chair and reached into the bag 
she was living out of while staying at Usagi&#39;s house. She pulled out a 
short jacket to wear instead. It was black, but she had to match her 
dress, didn&#39;t she?

&quot;Wow, Rei, you look...&quot;

Rei turned at the sound of Usagi&#146;s voice. The blonde was wearing only a 
pink towel, having just come from the bathroom. Rei smiled at her 
princess and spun around on the spot, giving the girl a complete view of 
her outfit.

&quot;You like it?&quot; Rei asked with a raised raven eyebrow.

Usagi swallowed nervously, seeming unable to pry her eyes away from her 
bodyguard&#39;s chest. &quot;It&#39;s very... umm...&quot; she started, and then blushed 
red. &quot;Nice...&quot;

The Senshi of Fire smirked at her princess. &quot;Just &#39;nice&#39;?&quot; she teased.

&quot;You&#39;re going to wear something over it... right?&quot; Usagi asked 
tentatively.

Rei held up the jacket in her hand. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, my princess, I&#39;ll take 
it off once we get to the restaurant... then you can stare all you 
want,&quot; she continued to tease her true love, giving the girl a wink 
before laughing at her expression and leaving the room.

&quot;Don&#39;t be too long,&quot; Rei called over her shoulder in a singsong voice as 
she proceeded down the stairs. She heard Usagi&#39;s bedroom door click 
close behind her.

As Rei stepped down the stairs, she was greeted by a gasp from Ikuko. 
&quot;Oh my, Rei,&quot; the woman exclaimed, clasping her hands together in front 
of her chest. &quot;Look at what a beautiful young woman you&#39;ve grown into!&quot; 
Usagi&#39;s mother gushed.

The Fire Senshi stopped at the foot of the staircase and reddened at 
Ikuko&#39;s compliment. &quot;I don&#39;t know about that...&quot; she mumbled with her 
head down.

&quot;Ohhh! The boys must be lining up to go out with you!&quot; Ikuko went on, 
gazing at Rei with starry eyes. She angled her body towards the living 
room but kept her eyes on the miko. &quot;Kenji! Come and see Rei!&quot; she 
called to her husband. Rei heard a rustle of newspaper and a wordless 
cry of acknowledgement, but Usagi&#39;s father didn&#39;t come out.

Ikuko sighed and took the Fire Senshi&#39;s hand, leading her into the 
living room. Rei saw that Chibi-Usa and Shingo were lazing about on the 
carpet near the TV, while Kenji was sitting in an armchair reading the 
paper. Ikuko let go of Rei&#39;s hand and held the girl&#39;s upper arms from 
behind, keeping the embarrassed miko in place.

&quot;Look at what a fine young woman Rei has matured into,&quot; Ikuko said again 
to her husband.

Kenji glanced over the top edge of his newspaper and then did a double 
take. &quot;She&#39;s ah... very pretty,&quot; he said hastily, using the newspaper to 
hide his reddening face. If Rei had known she was going to be paraded 
around like this she might have chosen a different dress.

&quot;Whoa, she&#39;s hot!&quot; Shingo proclaimed as he took in Rei&#146;s appearance. &quot;Do 
you wanna go on a date with me instead?&quot; Okay, now it was getting really 
humiliating.

&quot;Shingo!&quot; Ikuko gently chastised her son. &quot;I&#39;m sure Rei has a lovely boy 
waiting for her.&quot;

&quot;Ehh... yeah, something like that...&quot; Rei chuckled nervously, freeing 
one arm from Ikuko&#39;s grip so she could rub the back of her head.

&quot;It was a nice idea to double date with Usagi and Mamoru,&quot; Ikuko said, 
letting go of the Fire Senshi and moving in front of her.

Double date? Usagi must have said that to her mother. &quot;Well, someone has 
to keep an eye on the odango atama,&quot; Rei said quickly, aware of the look 
she was getting from Chibi-Usa. Damn, she had slipped up.

Chibi-Usa looked ready to say something, but was cut off by Ikuko. &quot;And 
here she comes now!&quot;

Rei turned her head towards the stairs, and felt all thoughts leave her 
mind at the sight of her angel. Usagi had opted to where a pure white 
dress to offset her bodyguard&#39;s, but was far more modest in design. The 
dress was similar to Rei&#39;s except that the bottom half was pleated, 
causing it to sway about the blonde&#39;s ankles as she walked. And it also 
revealed substantially less skin. The entire outfit was decorated with 
something that sparkled silver in the light. Rei couldn&#39;t help but be 
enthralled by the vision of her divine princess.

&quot;Oh... Kenji, come and look at our baby!&quot; Ikuko sighed blissfully. It 
was as if the woman had never seen Usagi go out on a date before. Though 
it was her daughter&#39;s first date with her best friend. But of course 
Ikuko didn&#39;t know that.

Rei didn&#39;t take her enraptured gaze off of her only love, totally 
mesmerised by the display of beauty. Usagi finished walking down the 
stairs and stood in front of her bodyguard.

&quot;How do I look?&quot; she asked brightly, glancing down at her dress and then 
back at Rei.

The raven-haired girl smiled somewhat dumbly at her true love. 
&quot;Absolutely gorgeous... just like you always are,&quot; she said truthfully, 
and so only the girl could hear, while staring deeply into Usagi&#39;s blue 
eyes.

The blonde&#39;s cheeks turned a light shade of pink Rei&#146;s words. &quot;Thanks. I 
know I don&#39;t have nearly as good a figure as yours, but...&quot; She trailed 
off, lowering her head.

Rei smiled at her princess and raised her chin with two fingers. &quot;You&#39;ll 
always be the most beautiful girl I have ever seen... and that includes 
me,&quot; she said, repeating the words Usagi had told her not long after the 
girl had declared she had more than friendly feelings for her best 
friend.

Usagi caught the reference and rolled her eyes. &quot;Stealing my mushy lines 
now, are you?&quot; she said playfully, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;Well, they&#39;re just so good,&quot; Rei grinned.

At that moment, both girls turned their heads to see that Ikuko was 
staring at them. Rei hastily let go of Usagi&#39;s chin and was suddenly 
wracked with spontaneous coughing, feeling her face become hot. The 
blonde odango atama was in no better condition. Mercifully, Kenji walked 
over to them, breaking the tension.

&quot;You&#39;re not going out like that with that man!&quot; he stated, wagging a 
finger at his daughter. &quot;I&#39;ll bet he just has one thing on his mind!&quot;

&quot;Daaaadd!&quot; Usagi whined, her mother&#39;s look forgotten. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with 
how I look? Rei thinks I look good.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and just look what she&#39;s wearing!&quot; Kenji cried, pointing at the 
girl in question. And then he quickly turned to Rei. &quot;No offence,&quot; he 
added sheepishly.

&quot;None taken,&quot; the Fire Senshi said without inflection.

&quot;Daaad! Mamoru isn&#39;t like that anyway!&quot; Usagi said, defending her 
boyfriend.

&quot;All men are like that!&quot; her father said. &quot;I&#39;m one aren&#39;t I? So I should 
know.&quot; He looked at Rei and then quickly returned his eyes to his 
daughter, closing them for a brief instant.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mr. Tsukino; I&#39;ll keep a close eye on her. Mamoru won&#39;t 
even so much as touch her while I&#39;m around!&quot; Rei declared emphatically 
to her princess&#39;s father, smirking at Usagi while she did so.

Kenji didn&#39;t look entirely convinced, but relented anyway. &quot;Alright... 
but you better be back by twelve, young lady, and if I find out that 
man-&quot;

&quot;Oh, let them go, Kenji,&quot; Ikuko said in a long-suffering tone, coming 
back into the conversation. &quot;They&#39;re both big girls now; they don&#39;t need 
your lectures.&quot; The woman then frowned at Rei and Usagi slightly. Rei 
thought it was definitely a good time to leave.

As if on cue, there was a meep of a car horn outside. That had to be the 
taxi Rei had arranged to take Usagi and herself to Marche aux Vins 
Yamada. The miko slipped on her jacket and pulled it closed.

&quot;We have to go now!&quot; Usagi said cheerfully, walking over to the coat 
rack and taking down a light blue jacket. She quickly put it on just as 
Rei joined her side. &quot;Don&#39;t wait up!&quot; the blonde called out before 
leaving the house in a hurry with her bodyguard, her last words meant to 
no doubt aggravate her father.

Rei looked at the taxi and then at Usagi. &quot;Shall we?&quot; she said with a 
smile, raising one elbow to her princess.

Usagi smiled back a little shyly at her raven-haired senshi, but linked 
her arm with the girl&#39;s. &quot;We shall,&quot; she replied, nodding to Rei.

And with that, the pair strolled towards their transportation, the fiery 
bodyguard escorting the beautiful princess. Both were unaware of the two 
sets of eyes staring through separate windows after them.
