<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 20 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>The song is called &quot;I Will Always Return&quot; sung by Bryan Adams. I don&#39;t 
own the song, nor Sailor Moon.

The senshi ran as fast as they could thru the maze of the crystal tower. 
Everyonce in a while they would turn back and ask Jupiter how she felt, 
but she&#39;d only glare, her eyes flashing white. After a few minutes of 
running aimlessly, the group stopped.

&quot;We&#39;re wasting time,&quot; Mars yelled. &quot;We need a direct path there!&quot;

&quot;Where the hell are we going anyway,&quot; Jupiter asked.

&quot;Where ever Diamond and Wiseman are,&quot; SailorMoon said. &quot;Mercury, think 
you could find a way?&quot;

She nodded and activated her visor and mini computer. &quot;It might take a 
few minutes...&quot;

&quot;No need to ask directions,&quot; an echoing voice said around them. &quot;I will 
bring you to me..&quot;

The senshi looked around, preparing themselves.

&quot;Where is he,&quot; Venus asked.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you just ask,&quot; Jupiter asked sarcastically.

&quot;Diamond!&quot; Sailor Moon looked around. &quot;Where are you?!&quot;

The booming voice laughed. &quot;I&#39;ll show you...&quot;

The floor beneath Sailor Moon dropped open, causing her to fall into the 
tunel below it. The senshi turned but were too late to grab her nor to 
follow.

&quot;Mercury, find that path quickly!&quot;

Sailor Moon screamed as she came flying out of the vent sized hole, 
laning on her butt as she fell to the ground.

She stood and looked around the room.

&quot;Where am I,&quot; she asked outloud.

&quot;My throne room, dear one.&quot;

Sailor Moon turned and saw Diamond leaning against the wall. He smirked 
at Sailor Moon before standing to his full height and aproaching her.

&quot;Are you afarid?&quot;

Sailor Moon eyed him. &quot;Why are you trying to destory my world?&quot;

He stopped his approach, glaring at her. &quot;Because you banished my people 
from here.&quot;

Sailor Moon blinked. &quot;I haven&#39;t banished anyone..&quot;

&quot;Not yet. But in the future, you do. I want to destory this place 
because you I know you hold it dear in your heart..&quot; He looked down, 
hiding the pain in eyes. &quot;..Like I once did.&quot;

Sailor Moon&#39;s heart went out to his pain. &quot;We don&#39;t have to fight. We 
can live together, peacefully..&quot;

Diamond looked up at her, growling. &quot;NO! We can&#39;t!&quot;

Sailor Moon approached him, cautiously, closing the gap in between them. 
&quot;Thats not true. We can, if we try.&quot; She smiled at him, truth shining 
thru her eyes.

&quot;But Wiseman...&quot; Then Diamond stopped. He blinked at Sailor Moon, his 
anger returning, but none directed at the princess in front of him. 
&quot;Wiseman...&quot;

&quot;You call, my prince?&quot;

Diamond and Sailor Moon turn to the man floating above them.

&quot;WISEMAN!&quot;T

The old man cackled evily, dark energy flowing out of his crystal ball 
toward Diamond. Diamond, expecting the attack easily blocks it, growling 
at his once trusted advior.

Their powers equally matched, the fighting pair began to teleport around 
the room, blocking one another&#39;s offensive attacks.

Sailor Moon hears a loud crash against the wall and turns to see the 
senshi breaking their way in thru the wall. She smiles but turns back to 
see Wiseman a few feet in front of her, his attack already coming toward 
her.

Sailor Moon&#39;s eyes widen, her body turning to block the attack, but is 
never hit. She hears painful grunt and turns in time to see Diamond take 
the full blast of the attack. As he falls, Sailor Moon wraps her arms 
around him. He smiles up at her and she smiles back, wiping the blood 
from his face.

Both look up as Wiseman floats near them. Although she could not see his 
face, Sailor Moon felt Wiseman&#39;s evil glare and wicked smile.

He raised his hand above his head, preparing another attack when one 
from behind caught him off guard.

&quot;JUPITER LIGHTNING FURY!!&quot;

The room filled with a bright light, blinding everyone. As the room 
faded back to its dull light, nearly pitch black due to the brightness 
of the attack, Wiseman lay in ashes next to his crystal ball.

The senshi ran twoards their friend as she stood.

Diamond had already passed on.

They hugged her, thankful she was alright. As they were about to start 
celebrate, the tower began to shake and crumble. They looked around and 
saw a few of the huge pillars in the room cracked and broken. Sailor 
Jupiter&#39;s attack had destroyed a few of the support beams.

&quot;Lets get out of here,&quot; Venus said quickly.

The group nodded and as they ran towards the door, Jupiter collapsed. 
Venus caught her, lowering her to her knees.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Jupiter shook her head. &quot;No..My body is starting to become very weak.&quot;

Venus nodded and pulled Jupiter toher feet. &quot;Come on baby, lets get out 
of here..&quot;

The group had stopped, waiting for their friends. As Jupiter and Venus 
appraoched the door, a cackling laugh made them all turn.

&quot;Cute trick, but it&#39;ll take more than that to kill me!&quot;

&quot;You have got to be kididng!&quot; Mars yelled.

Jupiter blinked, her breath ragged. She looked around the crumbling 
room. She then looked back to Wiseman, who was fading back into a portal 
of black.

&quot;I have to go after him..&quot;

Venus blinked at Jupiter. She opened her mouth to protest, but Jupiter 
pulled away from her, then pushed her out of the doorway just as debris 
fell, blocking the way in.

&quot;MAKOTO!!&quot; Came Venus&#39; ragged cry.

&quot;GET OUT OF HERE!&quot; Jupiter yelled back. She then looked at Wiseman&#39;s 
portal and ran to it, jumping thru it.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Mars said, gently tugging on Venus&#39; arm. &quot;We have to get out 
of here...&quot;

&quot;But Makoto..&quot; She looked towards her friends, tears streaming down her 
face.

&quot;We have to go, Minako,&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;Makoto knew what she was 
doing..She&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

Venus looked back to the blocked door way then ran away from it, as ahrd 
as it was, towards the exit of the tower. The other followed closly 
behind her.

The mad dash back out of the tower was hard, dodging debris. But the 
four senshi made it, running back from the tower. They stopped a good 
ways from it, watching as the tower began to collapse in on itself.

&quot;Come on Mako-chan,&quot; Venus said to herself. &quot;Come on...Come out...Come 
out...&quot;

They watched, the rain begining to pour down around them, soaking them 
in a matter of seconds.

&quot;Please, Mako-chan..Please...&quot; Venus began to cry harder,she could see 
no sign of her lover.

When the tower fell, Venus fell into a puddle of mud,her sobs violently 
shaking her body...

I hear the wind call your name

It calls me back home again

It sparks up the fire - a flame that still burns

Oh it&#39;s to you I&#39;ll always return

I still feel your breath on my skin

I hear your voice deep within

The sound of my lover - a feeling so strong

It&#39;s to you - I&#39;ll always belong

&quot;Come on, Minako,&quot; Rei said. &quot;Its prom night. The least you could do is 
smile once...&quot;

Mianko looked up from the ground towards her friends. Three 
weeks...Three weeks since that fight and Makoto was gone.

But she and her friends had survived.

Raiga stood in his tux, holding a camera in one hand, Ami&#39;s hand in the 
other. Yuuchirou held another camera, looking worridly at his 
girlfriend&#39;s friend. And Usagi and Mamoru stood close to him.

Minako was the only one without a date..

Minako sighed. The group had met at Rei&#39;s temple, a sort of pre-prom get 
together before dinner then the big dance.

Minako moved from her spot on the back porch of Rei&#39;s temple.

&quot;I can&#39;t do this, Rei. I just can&#39;t..&quot;

Rei frowned at her friend. &quot;Couldn;t you at least wait until my friend 
got here tell them you&#39;re not going? They agreed on the last minute to 
take you..&quot;

Minako sighed and shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t..its too hard.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t be too hard. I lived thru you dying, you could at least live thru 
me dying...&quot;

Minako growled, tears in her eyes. &quot;LOOK! I said I couldn&#39;t -&quot; Minako 
blinked. She spun around quickly, causing her dress to flow out around 
her.

Minako couldnt have heard that...It had been three weeks...she couldnt 
be...could she?

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

A figure exited out of Rei&#39;s temple, smiling, holding a single red rose.

&quot;Hello, Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako stood there, blinking, before running and jumping into Makoto&#39;s 
arms. &quot;MAKO-CHAN! YOU&#39;RE ALIVE!&quot; Minako pulled away. &quot;But..How!?&quot;

&quot;I defeated Wiseman in another dimension. When he died, the dimension 
faded and I was teleported back to what was left of the tower.&quot; Makoto 
smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I havn&#39;t talked to you these past three weeks. but I 
was beat up pretty badly.&quot;

Minako smiled, and ran her fingers trhu Makoto&#39;s hair. &quot;Is that why your 
hair&#39;s short?&quot;

Makoto chuckled. &quot;Yeah. It got pretty cinged.&quot;

Minako turned to her friends. &quot;Did you guys know about this?&quot;

They all looked arund, whsitling.

Minako glared. &quot;Brats..&quot;

Yuuchirou smiled and held up his camera. &quot;GIRL PIC!&quot;

The girls giggled, Rei, Usagi and Ami running to join Makoto and Minako. 
Usagi stood between Rei and Makoto. Minako stood to the other side of 
Makoto, hugging her arm. Ami stood beside Rei, and she and Rei both held 
onto Makoto&#39;s other arm. The girls laughed happily as Yuuchiro, Mamoru 
and Raiga all three snapped a photo of the group.

Now I know it&#39;s true

My every road leads to you

And in the hour of darkness darlin&#39;

Your light gets me through

Wanna swim in your river - be warmed by your sun

Bathe in your waters - cos you are the one

I can&#39;t stand the distance - I can&#39;t dream alone

I can&#39;t wait to see you - Ya I&#39;m on my way home

A few days later, the girls and Mamoru found themselves in the back of 
Usagi&#39;s yard, saying goodbye to the future princess.

Chibiusa hugged everyone and told them goodbye.

As she called out the spell to take her home, Usagi reache out and 
grabbed the small child&#39;s hand.

&quot;I love you, Chibiusa.&quot;

The child smiled, her fingers slipping away from Usagi&#39;s as she floated 
away.

&quot;I love you too, Mommy!&quot;

The light faded around Chibiusa. She looked around and saw the skyline 
of Crystal Tokyo in the distance. She smiled and took off running.

As she ran to a well known path, she saw people standing in her way. As 
she ran closer toward them, she saw them as her parents and the inner 
senshi. She smiled and ran as fast as her little legs would carry her.

When she was but a few feet away, she stopped and bowed before her 
parents. They smiled down at her. The Neo-Queen Serenity fell to her 
knees as Chibiusa ran toward her, hugging her mother.

They held one another for a few moments before the Queen pulled away.

&quot;There is someone who has been waiting to see you, my daughter. The she 
looked up and behind her daughter.

Chibiusa blinked and looked where her mother was. Coming into view was a 
blue blur. After a few moments, the blur becoming a large animal. Then 
the animal became more distingusiable as it neared the group.

Chibiusa&#39;s eyes grew large as she recognised the animal as a blue tiger. 
She pulled away from her mother&#39;s embrace and ran towards the tiger, who 
had sat on it&#39;s hunches.

Chibiusa flung herself around the cats neck, causing them to fall over.

&quot;HU-CHAN!!&quot;

He roared a might laugh, nudging the child&#39;s head affectionatly. &quot;Small 
lady..&quot;

&quot;How are you alive!?&quot;

He smiled at her, purring softly.

&quot;That, my dear, is a story for another time...&quot;

Oh I hear the wind call your name

The sound that leads me home again

It sparks up the fire - a flame that still burns

Oh, it&#39;s to you - I will always return</pre>
