<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Rei&#39;s POV

I couldn&#39;t sleep.

If what Manuke said was true, then this is it. I know Mina and I 
practiced till we were exhausted but even then I can&#39;t help but worry. 
For a moment I could hear nothing but the ticking tock, signaling the 
passing of the seconds and then minutes until the awaited moment where 
it all comes back to reality.

Oh...this is stupid! Since when do I worry about anything? I&#39;m not 
supposed to be insecure because of some man; I&#39;m a sailor soldier for 
crying out loud!

Frustration seeped in. Not being able to sleep my eyes began to wander 
around Mina&#39;s room, looking for something, anything to keep my mind 
occupied. If I was at home right now, I would have gone straight to the 
sacred fire and meditate. There was no point in wasting energy or 
fooling yourself that you were conserving any lying there like a dead 
slug. You&#39;ll be tired the next morning, no matter what you do.

With that thought in mind I pushed myself up from my sleeping bag. I had 
insisted on sleeping on the floor so Mina could keep the bed. But you 
know her. You can bet we had a little &#39;talk&#39; about that (It was actually 
a screaming match). Of course in the end I managed to win out (like 
there was a doubt); even if she hadn&#39;t fallen asleep during our argument 
I&#39;m sure I would have won. Although...right now I was almost regretting 
my victory. The floor was very cold. If only the girl decided to keep a 
futon instead of those things they call beds! Knowing Mina though, if I 
ever brought the idea up she&#39;d ask me if &#39;I was growing old&#39;. Of course 
I would retort with &#39;well I am a miko and I live in a shrine&#39;. And then 
we&#39;d end up in another pointless argument.

We&#39;ve been having a lot of those lately, but for play for the most part. 
It&#39;s practically routine now, like a second instinct.

I thought back to when I carried her from the living room to where I 
placed her gently in her bed. When I carried her in my arms, she felt 
light as a feather. It was amazing how light she actually is, I thought 
for sure she&#39;d be...heavier, although I won&#39;t be telling her that 
anytime soon (She&#39;d sock me). It could be that I was just imagining it, 
or perhaps I had grown some muscle from all of my shrine duties, but it 
was definitely something...

Familiar.

Familiar...familiar...familiar...

The words sent a wave of ripples through the calm I had established only 
moments before into chaos. The fact the sacred fire refused to show me 
what I wanted to know hovered like a heavy weight over my mind. The 
flame would only show me past memories that made no sense whatsoever... 
or brief images of...death.

Every time it would be Mina&#39;s. Why did it have to be hers? Why couldn&#39;t 
it have been my own?

Wait, scratch that. What I saw last time might&#39;ve been my death. Never 
mind, I sarcastically thought.

&quot;Rei chan...mm...do your best...&quot; I could hear Mina mumble.

I wonder what Mina would say if I told her that she dreams about me? It 
was almost cute, knowing that you&#39;re wanted, even if that person is fast 
asleep and conscious about it.

One of my hands automatically reached out to touch her soft face. 
Thoughts of trailing my fingers down her cheek, to touch those soft lips 
where I wished to lay my own slipped through my mind, but they would not 
reach my hand. If I compared myself to this sleeping angel, my touch 
would soil her perfection. It would be a crime of selfishness.

I let the hand drop back to my side. It&#39;s taking me a long time to 
figure out what my feelings are but it would take even longer suffering 
for an eternity if I did sometime unforgivably wrong. Especially with 
her, the goddess of beauty and love. The past is the past, who Mars was, 
what she chose to do, it has nothing to do with me or my present 
situation. It shouldn&#39;t!

But it does.

How do I know who these feelings belong to? Damn, it&#39;s so frustrating! 
If only I wasn&#39;t the reincarnation of Mars...

I leaned my back against Mina&#39;s mattress, allowing my head to fall 
beside the sleeping beauty&#39;s. &quot;If only you weren&#39;t...&quot;

...So special to me...

I wouldn&#39;t have to feel this way. I could have gone on believing that 
the world was unjust and cruel. I could have stayed alone, by 
myself...if I hadn&#39;t met you.

&quot;If I weren&#39;t what?&quot;

I was suddenly startled by my companion&#39;s voice. How long had she been 
awake? In response I tilted my head towards hers to see her watching me 
through half-lidded baby blues. Couldn&#39;t have been very long then.

&quot;I...didn&#39;t wake you did I?&quot;

She lightly shook her head and made a negative noise. &quot;You know, you 
should be sleeping too Rei-chan. If you don&#39;t get enough rest, you&#39;ll be 
all woozy for tomorrow.&quot; She glanced over at the clock. &quot;Erm...I meant 
today.&quot; She corrected herself.

&quot;Woozy?&quot;

Leave it up to Mina chan to come up with the weird sayings. Although I 
had to admit, they were always amusing.

&quot;How to explain it...Oh, I know.&quot; With that she tried to push herself up 
to a sitting position but failed miserable when her arms buckled under 
her, landing her back on the bed with a,

Flop.

&quot;That was a flop.&quot; I said flatly.

&quot;But a comfortable one.&quot; She giggled. &quot;If you go flop today, you&#39;ll hit 
a wooden floor Rei-chan, not a soft be-heeeeey, why are you sleeping on 
the floor anyway? No wonder you can&#39;t sleep! I told you to take the 
bed!&quot;

Oh, there was A LOT of reasons why I wanted to be on the floor. &quot;It&#39;s 
more comfortable down here.&quot;

&quot;Liar, I happen to know that floor is cold and hard as all get out.&quot;

&quot;And how would you know that?&quot;

&quot;I...Well...umm...I fall out of bed sometimes.&quot; Her voice shrunk to a 
whisper and her gaze averted downwards.

I could feel my eyes grow wide. I was trying to imagine our great leader 
rolling out of her bed like a little kid and then hitting the floor with 
a thud (which was almost too hilarious). I bet she gets a lot of &#39;boo 
boos&#39; that way too!

&quot;Hey, what are you snickering at?&quot; Mina pouted. &quot;You can&#39;t tell me 
that&#39;s never happened to you before!&quot;

&quot;Nope, it hasn&#39;t because I ALWAYS sleep on the floor.&quot;

&quot;You mean you&#39;ve never slept on a bed? People do it all the time back in 
England you know.&quot; She paused for a moment. &quot;Unless...Rei chan is too 
scared to fall out of the bed and THAT&#39;S why she sleeps on the floor.&quot; A 
smirk lit her features.

I gave a grunt. &quot;You&#39;re just jealous.&quot;

&quot;Proooove it.&quot; Her arm lazily slapped my shoulder.

&quot;How? By sleeping in bed with you?&quot; I saw her face flush instantly at my 
words. It actually had taken me a few seconds to realize what I had just 
said. I hadn&#39;t meant it that way! But then again, why was she blushing? 
Oh, wait a second here! Wait a minute...I can use this...to my 
advantage. Evil thoughts were going through my head but who cares? If 
you were awake at 2:00a.m in the morning and you were tired I say screw 
it, anything goes! &quot;Why are you blushing? Unless ...don&#39;t tell me Mina 
chan is having perverted thoughts!&quot; I feigned shock with a hint of 
surprise. Now just to ham it up. (If this was with anyone else instead 
of Mina chan I would have died from embarrassment by now).

&quot;P-Perverted thoughts?&quot; She sputtered. &quot;Absolutely not!&quot;

&quot;Aww, you hurt me. Do you mean to say that... I&#39;m not desirable?&quot;

Now it was time to take the cake.

&quot;R-Rei...? W-what are you doing? Keep your pants on!&quot; She panicked.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; I took my long pants off to reveal a pair of shorts underneath, 
leaving Mina&#39;s face as red as a tomato. &quot;What did you think I was 
doing?&quot; I gave an innocent face.

WHAP! A pillow flew into my head, yet I didn&#39;t care, I was too busy 
rolling on the floor laughing my ass off.

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that, you did that on purpose!&quot; She accused with a 
pointed finger. Yup, she was definitely awake now.

&quot;So what if I did? There&#39;s nothing you can do about it-&quot; I stopped dead 
sentence, feeling the strap of my shorts being pulled back. She 
wouldn&#39;t! &quot;C-come on Mina-chan, you know it was a joke right?&quot;

&quot;Yes Rei-chan I know.&quot; She raised an eyebrow. &quot;And this...&quot;

Snap!

&quot;YIPE!&quot;

&quot;...is revenge.&quot; I really...reeeeally hate it when she does that. &quot;Uh 
oh.&quot; She squeaked.

I was about to argue back when I noticed half of Mina&#39;s body was hanging 
over her bed, her face was staring at the ground. How long was she like 
that? I knew she had to reach out to grab my shorts, but... &quot;Mina-chan?&quot; 
I walked up to her and crouched down with my knees together, checking if 
she had passed out on me again. You never know; Mina can be strange in 
those ways.

It made me wonder...was she was anything like this in our previous 
lives?

&quot;Mina...?&quot;

&quot;I...can&#39;t...get...up.&quot; She sweat dropped.

&quot;Do you think there&#39;s a chance that you&#39;ll fall out of bed if I left you 
this way? Because, that would be really interesting to see.&quot;

&quot;Rei! I&#39;m serious!&quot; I could see the blood rushing to her head. It was 
also a shame that her shirt happened to be slipping down as well.

Oh dear...

&quot;Okay, okay... give me a second.&quot; I seated myself on the bed beside her 
and wrapped my arms around her waist, immediately noticing the direct 
skin contact. Wait, first concentrate on helping Mina! I tried to 
command my brain. &quot;Errr-up you go. Are you good-&quot;


The next thing I knew, her arms flung around my neck and sent up both 
sprawling on the bed.

&quot;Now I&#39;m good.&quot; Her eyes twinkled back mischievously. &quot;I needed a new 
teddy bear anyway. Rei-bear.&quot;

I lifted an eyebrow at the new nickname. &quot;What makes you think I&#39;m going 
to be your teddy bear?&quot; Where did this look familiar?

&quot;Because I said so, slave.&quot;

I opened my mouth but no words came out. She wasn&#39;t supposed to take 
that whole slave/master bit seriously!

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry so much Rei-chan, you shouldn&#39;t take things so 
seriously all the time... Lighten up.&quot;

S...ser-serious.... &quot;Serious?&quot; It made me wonder how I could be any less 
&#39;serious&#39;. If anyone else saw me like this I think they would have a 
heart attack or think they were in the twilight zone.

&quot;Besides, you&#39;d make a good teddy bear. You&#39;re warm, strong and really, 
really soft.&quot; I felt her snuggle into my chest for emphasis, making me 
gulp. And you can keep me from falling off the bed.&quot; She quickly added.

&quot;Oh. Well, if you put it that way...&quot; I allowed myself to slip under the 
covers. &quot;Hey Mina...&quot;

&quot;Mm...?&quot;

&quot;This is actually quite comfy.&quot;

Minako&#39;s POV Dress Rehearsal

&quot;Testing the lights!&quot; The light&#39;s controller called out. &quot;Testing set 
one.&quot;

CLICK- Clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk.

The first set came on accordingly.

&quot;Set one check. Turning on set two.&quot;

CLICK- Clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk.

&quot;Set two check.&quot;

I watched in awe behind the curtain as our technicians were doing the 
round about system check. It looked like a lot of fun! I wonder what it 
would be like to play around with the lights? Maybe they&#39;ll let me help 
next time?

&quot;You still act like a kid.&quot; Rei mumbled from behind me. She had her 
usual frown on, the one for whenever she&#39;s in public. I wonder if her 
face ever hurts from keeping it that way for so long? It made me think 
back to Manuke&#39;s smiling from before, when we were talking about 
Rei-chan in the park. Does that mean smiling hurts people too? I put a 
finger to my lips. Funny, because I&#39;ve never had that kind of problem.

&quot;Is that such a bad thing?&quot; I turned to face my companion.

Rei shook her head.&quot;No, but I just think you should be taking this a 
little more seriously, that&#39;s all. I mean none of us have been in this 
sort of situation before. There&#39;s going to be a lot of people watching. 
Our fate really seems to be resting in their hands.&quot;

Rei always disliked having to rely on others...but I think, by now she&#39;s 
come to rely on me a little bit. Or that&#39;s what I secretly hoped.

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly! We&#39;ll do fine if we put our hearts into it!&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Rei gave me a &#39;you&#39;re too cheerful it&#39;s scary&#39; look.

&quot;That&#39;s right Rei, don&#39;t be such a downer.&quot; Manuke had joined us in his 
usual attire.

As predicted, Rei was fuming at the sight of the man. &quot;Mind your own 
business.&quot; She growled.

&quot;Manuke, Rei, please don&#39;t fight! The concert is today.&quot; I tried to 
remind them. What was a show without a manager or one of the singers to 
a duet performance?

&quot;You&#39;re so right Mina-chan.&quot; Manuke immediately smiled. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be 
fighting, not when this is your big day.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s Rei&#39;s big day too.&quot;

&quot;Ahh...yes, her too.&quot; He looked at his watch. &quot;Oops, look at the time, 
we must start. So I will wish you good luck ladies, please, try to avoid 
any injury.&quot;

&quot;We will!&quot; I instantly agreed.

I mean, how we possible get injured in a dress rehearsal?

Rei&#39;s POV, start of dress rehearsal

I waited on the far end of the stage, opposite to where Mina was 
positioned. It was supposed to be our big entrance, something that 
&#39;would catch the crowd&#39; from the start. Supposedly all the pros do this 
when they&#39;re starting out. It&#39;s called a &#39;gimmick&#39; or something that 
would give the performing band/group a trademark that people can easily 
identify with.

But I don&#39;t know...I really disliked the fact they keep the stage lights 
this dim! It was hard to see anything.

&quot;Cue the music!&quot;

A soft tune wafted through the area. That was the cue.

First I needed to reach out my arm. I raised my arm out, palm up and 
then waited until I heard Mina begin the song. After she sings the first 
few lines, I was supposed to take over. Can&#39;t say that I&#39;m not nervous 
myself so it made it curious as to how Mina would take this, especially 
since she was opening the show.

I could hear her voice but it was too soft! I was afraid it would stop 
altogether until it began to steady out as she pushed forwards. Well, if 
she could get through this, then I should be able as well.

&quot;Can you find the real me?

Somewhere here, dreaming somewhere, hurting everywhere

For a far off memory...&quot;

I took a step forward but jerked to a stop when I felt the floor sag 
quite a bit under my weight.

Creeeeak

Instinctively I stepped back before tentatively pressing my foot back 
down on the spot once more, checking it for faults. It was definitely 
sinking too much, nothing like the other places on the stage.

&quot;Rei, that was your cue.&quot;

Huh? &quot;O-oh, sorry.&quot;

Up in the control room

Manuke grinned happily as he watched Rei hesitate with her lines. This 
is it. He thought. He was practically giddy thinking of how he could 
hurt dear Rei-chan. She had become a nuisance, a thorn in the side. If 
his angel didn&#39;t have to worry about that overprotective mutt that she 
called a friend then surely she would fall into his arms. He had to 
admit though, the raven haired woman had unexpected spunk; he never 
thought she would last this long.

While the control attendant was busy doing the finishing touches to the 
lighting system Manuke&#39;s fingers flipped up the switch for the third set 
of lights, bringing them on full force.

CLICK

Ooooooops.

Rei&#39;s POV Down on stage

CLICK-

What was-

Clunk! Clunk! Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!

&quot;Ah!&quot; My arms flew up when bright lights suddenly engulfed me.

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; I heard Mina yell.

Ow, my eyes! Words would not come out of my mouth, only sounds of 
painful hisses. It feels like they&#39;re burning!

Shaking, I stumbled backwards before coming to a dead stop at the 
stage&#39;s edge. Sensing the sudden lack of ground my legs reflexively 
stopped before my balance would fail me. The action had then prompted me 
to force myself to step forward instead of backwards.

As I fell to one knee, I couldn&#39;t help but curse how the lights weren&#39;t 
due to come on for another six lines! And definitely not that many! What 
was going on?

Tup, tup, tup, tup!

&quot;Rei, are you all right?&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m fine Mina.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re shaking...&quot;

&quot;I said I&#39;m fine!&quot;

That was when I heard Manuke&#39;s annoying little voice boom throughout the 
stadium. &quot;Ah, sorry about that! Technical difficulties, we&#39;ll have it 
sorted out in a bit. Is everyone okay down there? Mina chan? REI chan?&quot;

&quot;I think-&quot; Mina was about to reply.

&quot;We&#39;re fine, thank you very much!&quot; I snapped back; this was his doing 
wasn&#39;t it. Well I wasn&#39;t about to give in to his little tricks anytime 
soon.

&quot;Oh...&quot; I heard disappointment playing in that bastard&#39;s voice. &quot;Well, 
glad to hear that. Let&#39;s continue shall we?&quot; I could have sworn he sung 
that last sentence.

Unfortunately the rest of the rehearsal wasn&#39;t much better. Throughout 
the entire act there were multiple &#39;mishaps&#39;, or &#39;technical 
difficulties&#39; according to Manuke. Something would barely nick me or put 
me out of action and his annoying voice would then announce the oh so 
obvious along with his false apologies.

At the rate things were going, I doubt Mina and I will make it past 
halfway of our routine.

&quot;All right, we fiiiix it. From the top if you would please.&quot;

The stage became dark once more. Although I was now used to expecting 
some sort of dirty trick against me, I had to wonder what else he could 
do. He&#39;s practically used everything at his disposal hadn&#39;t he. Then 
again...there was that one spot on the floor that kept coming back to 
me. Why did it keep creaking the way it did? Wasn&#39;t there some sort of 
name for those sort of spots on stage?

&quot;Cue the music!&quot;

&quot;Can you find the real me?

Somewhere here, dreaming somewhere, hurting everywhere

For a far off memory...&quot;

I stepped forward.

Creeeeak

Up in the control room

A smirk spread across Manuke&#39;s features once more. He was not perturbed 
that Rei had escaped his little surprises, mainly because they were only 
the warm ups.

His fingers drummed the top of the control panel thoughtfully, cocking 
his head the side as he watched his victim about to make her move. Now 
if only she would take one-step to the left...that&#39;s right...one 
more...It was a part of the choreography after all, dear Rei-chan 
couldn&#39;t stray off of it now.

&quot;Press that button for me will you?&quot; He casually asked the personnel.

&quot;What? You can&#39;t be serious! That&#39;s the one-&quot;

&quot;Hey, who&#39;s the manager here? Press it or I&#39;ll have you fired before you 
can say &#39;damn I&#39;m so stupid that lost my job&#39;.&quot;

The other man stared back with disbelief on his face. He couldn&#39;t 
understand why the girls&#39; manager of all people would want to sabotage 
their debut performance!

&quot;Do it now before I get really mad. And I can promise you, you don&#39;t 
want that.&quot; Manuke growled in a deep voice.

The action had done its job. It was enough to startle the worker into 
submission.

Click.

Rei&#39;s POV, stage

Ka-whop!

The next thing I knew, I was falling!

&quot;AHHHHHH!&quot;

THUD

&quot;Stop the rehearsal!&quot; Someone was screaming.

Slowly I pushed myself to a sitting up position, feeling dizzy and 
confused all at once. What just happened? I remember stepping forward 
like I was supposed and then...I heard that creaking noise before the 
floor disappeared!

Immediately I looked up to see the bright light from the stage shining 
through the square like opening. That&#39;s right, now I remember. Trap 
doors...

Manuke...I silently growled.

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

&quot;Rei! Rei-chan!&quot; Mina&#39;s face appeared in the small window above. There 
was concern painted all over her face, making me feel guilty to allow 
myself to let my guard down, even if the attack was a cheap shot. Now 
I&#39;ve gotten Mina all worried, I inwardly groaned. This was not how it 
should have been.

Casually as I could I replied back with a, &quot;Hey.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right? We&#39;ll get you out in a second! Don&#39;t move!&quot; She 
called back.

Don&#39;t move? Is that supposed to be a joke? I feel so sore that I doubt I 
could move if I wanted to. (Unless I was going to kill Manuke, I could 
make an exception for that. I&#39;m sure that sort of motivation would get 
me moving again).

In a matter of moments, a ladder was hauled down. Mina was the first one 
who had made it down to me.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, really.&quot; I mumbled when she began to pat my body, searching 
for injury. She was acting more like...I tried to finish the thought 
with mother and then father but neither word seemed appropriate. Grandpa 
was nice but he was perverted. So what did that leave me with? Friend 
or...

&quot;You didn&#39;t sprain anything did you?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Do you feel dizzy?&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot; I lied. My head was actually throbbing like crazy!

&quot;Okay...okay...&quot;

&quot;Mina...breath.&quot;

I watched the blonde take a deep breath. &quot;HAH...Hoooo.&quot; I understood 
that it had been some time since the both of us had these exciting 
battles to deal with. Although Mina had been our leader, she hadn&#39;t been 
required to keep her emotions quite in check as she used to. That little 
face actually made me happy; it&#39;s nice to see her being herself.

&quot;Feeling better?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Ha. Ha...I should be the one asking you that. Now let&#39;s get you out of 
here.&quot; I felt her sling my arm around her shoulders before we were about 
to make the climb from hell.

Mina&#39;s dressing room

&quot;Here.&quot; My blonde partner handed me an ice pack. Taking it, I 
immediately pressed it to my head while refusing to meet her gaze. The 
entire incident was still humiliating, not matter how I looked at it. 
Mina had to come to my rescue. Wasn&#39;t it supposed to be the other way 
around?

I inwardly groaned. This just wasn&#39;t my day.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;So what happened?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I shrugged. &quot;I was about to start my part as planned 
when the floor suddenly dropped out from beneath me. Oh and please don&#39;t 
tell me Manuke said it was another &#39;technical difficulty&#39;.&quot; Or I&#39;ll 
strangle him for real!

Mina slowly nodded.

&quot;Do you actually believe any of that? Because I&#39;ve been thinking we&#39;ve 
been having a little too many accidents.&quot;

&quot;Then you think he&#39;s trying to sabotage us?&quot; Mina frowned. I could tell 
she doubted what I was telling her. The man was our manager after all, 
even if he was a perverted, twisted rat, Mina would still believe him 
because she was too kind hearted. And even if she did know the truth, 
she couldn&#39;t do anything about it without risking her dream.

&quot;I doubt we&#39;d have so many difficulties in a row. First it was the 
lights, then the incident with the curtains, the mike shutting off, the 
music frizzing out on my parts and then the trap door! Unless I&#39;m 
extremely cursed, I&#39;m willing to bet my life that it&#39;s no accident.&quot;

I watched the blonde woman open one of her dresser doors and took out a 
long, red ribbon, seeming to ignore me. Why was she doing her hair now? 
Wasn&#39;t she listening to a word I was saying?

&quot;Hmm...Well just in case you are cursed, let&#39;s put your hair up with 
this. It&#39;ll bring you good luck!&quot; She giggled.

I nearly choked on air after hearing that kind of reply. I-It was for 
me? &quot;I&#39;m not cursed!&quot; I insisted. I was indignant!

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be like that.&quot; She hushed me as she would a child with a 
temper tantrum.

Seeing the smile on her face I immediately shut up. (Raises the white 
flag of surrender) Sometimes...I think I&#39;m a real pushover.

I sat patiently as Mina put my hair up into a ponytail with the long, 
thin strand of material. I seriously doubted it would bring me luck but 
she means well. &quot;Thanks...&quot;

She sighed. &quot;I know what you&#39;re saying Rei chan and don&#39;t worry! I&#39;ll go 
talk to Manuke okay?&quot;

&quot;What? Wait a minute, what are you going to say? You can&#39;t really do 
anything you know...&quot;

She did her &#39;V&#39; for victory pose. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Rei. Lighten up, 
I&#39;ve got it covered.&quot;

&quot;Mina...&quot;

&quot;Be back in a bit.&quot; And she was out the door.

Great...But I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what she meant when she said that 
she had it covered. For all I know, Manuke could assure her that all 
those mishaps were real accidents and she&#39;d believe it. It&#39;s known that 
people will believe anything if they&#39;re truly determined, no matter what 
the evidence is. Even if there was a &#39;maybe&#39; or a shred of truth that 
could be used as an excuse, they&#39;ll naturally turn a blind eye.

Tick...tock...tick...tock...

Time continued to tick by without a word or hair of Mina.

&quot;I wonder what&#39;s taking her?&quot;

Briiiiiing, briiiiiiiiing...

Could things get any worse? I pushed myself onto my feet and stumbled 
out of the room to check both sides of the hallway but still no 
Mina-chan. Who was supposed to answer her phone then?

The phone continued to ring, leaving me the only person in the room or a 
radius of the hallway around.

Briiiiiing, briiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing...

Grumbling in defeat I sorely moved over and picked up the irritating 
device.

Briiiiiin-

&quot;Hello?&quot;

There was an odd static sound from the other end of the line and then a 
bunch of jumbled up noises. Was the person talking or what?

I pressed the phone closer to my ear.

&quot;Oy, Reeeeeeeei-chan.&quot;

My eyes automatically narrowed from hearing THAT voice. &quot;Listen, if 
you&#39;re looking for Mina she&#39;s not here.&quot;

There was a slight pause from the other end. &quot;...Oh, I know. In fact, 
she&#39;s actually with me.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, nothing. I just thought...you might want to know where she&#39;s 
been for all this time. We&#39;re all having an outdoor party at the company 
building, did you want to come?&quot;

&quot;No thanks.&quot; He bothered me for this?

I was about to hang up the phone when I heard an,&quot; Ah, ah, ah! Perhaps I 
should have made myself clearer. You. Have. No. Choice. Because...you 
see, I get quite lonely being all by myself working long hours for the 
company and I love having people over. So me n&#39; Mina-chan might have a 
night out together.&quot;

&quot;YOU BETTER NOT LAY A HAND ON HER!&quot; I shouted at the top of my lungs.

&quot;Owww...you scream loud.&quot; He whined. &quot;But that&#39;s good! It means that you 
have energy!&quot;

CRACK

The phone&#39;s cheap plastic broke in my hands, cutting our conversation 
short. He was always going on about this for some time now but now he&#39;s 
crossed the line.

&quot;Enough of this bullshit.&quot;

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

Minako&#39;s POV, outside her dress room, sometime later

I wonder why Manuke asked me to go buy us all drinks. And I couldn&#39;t 
believe the machines were on the other side of the building, why do they 
make them so far? It took me forever just to get there and not to 
mention that horrendously long line up! Don&#39;t people have anything 
better to do than to drink coffee on their work breaks?

I entered my dressing room wondering if Rei would even like what I got 
her. The priestess tended to be quite secretive about what she liked and 
disliked...well, except when it came to Manuke; she made it clear that 
she hates him.

&quot;Rei-chan, I got you something-&quot; Huh? I walked over to the sitting stool 
where I had left the raven-haired woman. To my surprise, she wasn&#39;t 
there now or anywhere in the room for that matter. &quot;Rei-chan?&quot;

Where...could she have gone?

It was possible that she went out for a walk, she does that a lot when 
she&#39;s feeling down. Or maybe she decided to go get a drink for herself. 
Darn it Rei!

I hung my head. &quot;Aww...now what am I going to do with all these drinks?&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV, outside the company building

If I thought I had a bad feeling before, the one I was getting now was 
hitting the maximum level bar. I never thought I&#39;d feel this again, not 
since those youma battles awhile back.

Tup...tup...tup...

As I walked forward I scanned my surroundings. Manuke said they were 
outside didn&#39;t he? So where was everyone? The place was empty! There 
were a few trees out front but that was it. There weren&#39;t any tables, 
any guests, or...anything related to an outdoor get together. Then that 
meant it must have been another one of his lies.

Even if this &#39;get together&#39; was a lie there was no telling if he was 
lying about Mina-chan. Who knows, he could have her all tied up and 
hidden in a closet for all I know. All right, I admit I&#39;m exaggerating. 
Mina knows how to take care of herself but there are just some things 
you can&#39;t guard against. Like...blackmail.

Not being the one who likes to wait around for action to come to me, I 
circled around the building slowly. Occasionally I thought I saw 
something in the bushes but it couldn&#39;t have been anything serious. My 
senses would have warned me.

Finally I peeked around the corner to check if the close was clear. 
Thinking it was, I stepped into a clearing only to find I had done so 
too soon.

&quot;So you actually came? And you even changed clothes! Pity, for such a 
formal invitation you only came in casual wear?&quot; I spotted Manuke 
staring out at me from his office window. Manuke was leaning on his 
elbows on the windowsill, watching me in amusement. &quot;Wow, then that 
means...you have a lot less brains than I gave you credit for. TOOOO BAD 
Rei-chan!&quot;

&quot;Where is she?&quot;

&quot;&#39;She&#39;?&quot; He gave an innocent face. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Stop playing games Manuke!&quot;

&quot;Oooh, you mean my gorgeous blonde to-be lover? Ain&#39;t here.&quot;

&quot;...&quot; I glared up at him. If I could transform into Mars I would burn 
his ass so bad right now.

&quot;Tell me Rei-chan, have you ever thought about the meaning of life?

...Rumble...rumble...

My eyes were momentarily distracted by the circling clouds overhead. 
Don&#39;t tell me it was going to rain!

&quot;What of it?&quot; He better make this quick.

&quot;People spend so little time actually thinking about it don&#39;t you think? 
Some dream of fame, some of fortune while others just want to find their 
lifetime soul mate...isn&#39;t that romantic? Yet...society forgets that 
there&#39;s one tiny, tiny problem. All life must come to an end.&quot; There was 
a dangerous glint in his eyes as he finished.

He snapped his fingers.

Snap.

A group of bodyguards emerged from the green covering. I noticed that 
they all wore a black uniform similar to Manuke. As for their weapons, 
from what I could see some carried guns while others carried large 
batons that a police officer would normally carry. The standard bad-guy 
equipment in my books, they had nothing to a youma.

Yet it wasn&#39;t the fact that they were here that bothered me, not quite 
so much. I wanted to know why I hadn&#39;t been able to sense them!

Plip plip.

&quot;Ah, the rain...&quot; Manuke softly sighed. &quot;Look on the bright side Hino, 
at least the sky is willing to cry for your death. And I&#39;d love to watch 
the event but I&#39;ve got an angel to comfort after her &#39;single&#39; 
performance. Good-bye Rei-chan.&quot;

&quot;Manuke!&quot;

Ah! I turned in time to see one of the bodyguards lift his gun.

Ca-chink.

BAM!

Minako&#39;s POV, stage

I wonder where Rei-chan is...

Through the curtain I could see the crowd was pouring into the stadium 
in droves, making me all the more nervous. There were so many people! I 
never thought they could all fit, despite the stadium&#39;s size.

At the corners of the place the technicians were doing last minute 
check-ups, prompted from today&#39;s dress rehearsal. I really hoped nothing 
bad would happen, this was the actual performance.

I watched one man in particular turn on the switch to the large screens 
on the walls. Each window had a picture of the stage up close and 
personal-if I wasn&#39;t careful, I&#39;d be seen before the show even starts.

With that in mind I back away from the red curtain.

Rei chan wouldn&#39;t let me down would she? My hands fumbled unconsciously. 
No, that&#39;s not possible. If Rei says she&#39;ll do something, she&#39;ll do 
it...

I&#39;m not going to do anything half way! If I agree to do it, then I do it 
with everything I&#39;ve got.

...That&#39;s right, she&#39;ll do it with everything she&#39;s got. I clenched my 
fists.

Besides, who do I think I am? I used to be a warrior who faced countless 
battles and died many times when it was required. Why should this life 
be any different? Why should I be afraid of what the crowd thinks? What 
will happen, will happen, that&#39;s the way things go.

And...

There&#39;s no guarantee that Rei will love me back the same way I love her. 
I can&#39;t allow myself to lean on her so much! I...I can&#39;t. I try so hard 
not to but as they say...old habits die-hard.

Hope. That&#39;s what I have, what I cling onto. Rei-chan will come 
through...I know it.

Rei&#39;s POV, company&#39;s back building

&quot;OOF!&quot; I had evaded the attack and kneed the man in the chest, taking 
him down in one hit.

&quot;Bitch!&quot; One of his comrades cried.

Four more came at me.

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

WHACK! POW! WHOP! KA-CRACK!

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

Enough of this play fighting, I needed to get back to the stadium and 
NOW!

&quot;Hey, get back here!&quot;

Like hell I will!

In a flash I was running down the streets through the pelting rain. With 
nothing but the casual clothes I wore, I was quickly soaked to the bone. 
Too late to worry about a jacket now!

Cold, so cold! Everything was becoming numb. I was barely aware of the 
sound of rushing footsteps behind me, how my own legs clicked on the 
sidewalk as I ran, or the fact that I couldn&#39;t see where I was going. 
There was only one thing on my mind.

&quot;Hah! Hah! Mina...&quot;

I zipped around a corner just as a car past me, sending even more of the 
water up into the air. In surprise my reflexes made my body twist 
accordingly to avoid most of the splash, only to fall due to the 
slippery sidewalk surface.

Twist Thud.

Ow...No problem I&#39;ll just get u- &quot;Gah!&quot; I took a sharp intake of air as 
I tried to move my leg. Instantly I knew it was my ankle.

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

My eyes darted behind me to the closing in of following footsteps. They 
would be here any minute, leaving me with only one option. This time I 
found myself swallowing my pride for the sake of survival.

Skff...skff...

Forcing my arms to move I dragged my dead weight into the side alleyway 
and hid as the group of bodyguards went zipping by. They sounded like an 
army with all their footsteps exactly in time with one another.

Tup! Tup!
Tup! Tup!
Tup! Tup!
Tup! Tup!
Tup! Tup!
Tup! Tup!

Well...doesn&#39;t this bring back memories? As my eyes took in the sight I 
felt a strong sense of amusement rise up despite my own anxiety. Mars 
was having fun wasn&#39;t she? Well I wasn&#39;t.

I had avoided detection but damn, now they&#39;re going to beat me there!

&quot;Frick...&quot;

For a moment I held still, listening to the water falling all around me. 
Hard droplets battered the building&#39;s walls and into the ground to form 
the large puddles before flowing down the streets and into the sewers.

I couldn&#39;t sense another human being for blocks around. It was just 
me...here...alone.

Gomen ne...Venus. Mar&#39;s words came back to me.

If I really did die back then...right there...

CRACKLE-BOOM!

Lightning broke the sky above, briefly illuminating the area. I could 
see the small scrapes on my arms, the traces of dirt on my arms and 
clothing as it was being ripped off by the rainwater.

Again I tried to move my leg again to feel the anticipated pain shoot 
upwards, only this time it didn&#39;t hurt nearly as much. Both of my legs 
were almost completely numb even though I wore a pair of jeans. 
Unfortunately my arms were not so lucky...

It then occurred to me that could just stay here...nothing was going 
right anyway. The dress rehearsal was a flop so how will I actually 
perform in front of all those people? Mina could pull it off without a 
hitch I&#39;m sure. She didn&#39;t need to worry about someone else, she could 
concentrate on her parts. Besides, she knew the song inside out. It was 
ironic how both of us didn&#39;t have to worry about Manuke in the end. I 
found out that I was capable of taking myself out of action. Maybe I was 
cursed. If I stayed here where I was, I&#39;d probably catch a cold. But 
even before all that, my body would shut down like it was doing now. 
Sailor Senshi...were not immune to death after all.

Gomen ne...

I shook my head, trying to expel the echoing words. They sounded cold 
and distant, yet they kept coming back, haunting me as before. Why 
couldn&#39;t she stop this madness? I know Mars was something at least. Even 
though she knew her actions would lead her to death&#39;s door, she did it 
for Venus. I know that! Give...me a break...

But...that would mean she also left Venus all alone didn&#39;t it? Another 
voice gently reminded me.

Even though Mina-chan wasn&#39;t Venus, even though she was a reincarnation 
of the woman, Mar&#39;s lover...Was Mar&#39;s reincarnation liable for the 
blonde woman and leader that Hino Rei had come to trust? Perhaps even...

Gomen ne...

...What did I fear...What was there to fear? Losing my own life? No, it 
definitely wasn&#39;t that. I&#39;ve died so many times already. Then...was it 
failure?

Hmm, what do I think? I think... I&#39;ll believe in Rei-chan.

Mina-chan...

&quot;...&quot; I leaned back against the building&#39;s brick wall and smiled up at 
the sky, my bangs laid over my eyes. &quot;Pfft...who ever heard of the 
goddess of war being afraid to fight?&quot; If I died now, the next time I 
meet Mina, I&#39;m sure she wouldn&#39;t let me live another lifetime down 
without teasing me about it. We can&#39;t that happening can we?

My hands came up behind my head to undo the &#39;good luck charm&#39;. Maybe you 
were right Mina...

I wrapped the ribbon around my leg and my high-heel shoe before tugging 
it tightly into a firm knot. Surprisingly enough I knew some first aid. 
I had remembered not to wrap the material too tightly and cut off what 
little circulation I had.

...Maybe it will bring me good luck.

&quot;This...should do it.&quot; I gripped the wall as I stood, making sure I had 
something in case my plan failed.

As I applied pressure to the injured limb and tested it, I soon found to 
my delight that the wall was not necessary after all.

&quot;All right! Here I go!&quot;

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

Wait for me Mina...

Minako&#39;s POV, stage

&quot;And now we finally introduce to you our star of our show!&quot;

The curtain parted, revealing my dressed up form to the audience. 
Immediately there were mummers of all sorts.

&quot;What, wasn&#39;t this supposed to be a duet?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I heard.&quot;

&quot;Who cares? That chick is so hot!&quot;

&quot;Hey, will you go out with me!&quot;

I felt my hands tighten around my microphone as the crowd screamed and 
cheered. Inside I was nervous, deadly nervous but I refused to show it. 
No one would be able to tell by looking at my face. As I glanced around 
at all the giant screens around me I could see they portrayed to the 
crowd a confident, resolved woman who was about to entertain them with 
one song.

I can do this, I told myself. The crowd wasn&#39;t my main concern now, 
their presence didn&#39;t affect me as it had a half hour before. If I was 
going into this business then seeing so many people was necessary.

The crowd hushed as I lifted the microphone to my mouth.

&quot;This song...&quot;

Wherever you are, please hear this Rei-chan...

Rei&#39;s POV, stadium entrance

&quot;Hey I&#39;ve spotted her!&quot;

&quot;Well don&#39;t just stand there, get- GAH!&quot;

Thud! Thud!

I had finally broken into the building. My prize? Only to see guards 
absolutely everywhere! Manuke must have really gone full out with this. 
I wonder how much he pays these goons anyway? Because he isn&#39;t getting 
his money&#39;s worth!

I tried taking the main entrance to the backstage door but I should have 
known I was asking for it. The plan was essentially suicide! I had only 
taken one step into the hallway when another group of guards had already 
lifted guns pointed in my direction.

Oops, wrong way.

Tup! Tup! Tup!

Bam!

I ducked back around the corner as the bullet missing my head by inches.

Guess there&#39;s no choice then. If I can&#39;t get backstage, I&#39;ll break in 
through the top balcony!

I ran around another corner before shooting into a narrow staircase, one 
that had been conveniently left unguarded. I doubt anyone could have 
guessed the refuge would take the long route.

I was just running on pure emotion now. Only a little more...

Click-WOOOOOSH

I threw open the door at the top, bringing me into the stadium. The 
crowd&#39;s roars bombarded my ears. After hearing nothing but the falling 
rain or the guards demanding for my death, I couldn&#39;t help but think 
that this was a nice change.&quot;Who&#39;s she?&quot; One audience woman asked her 
friend.

Now if I could get to the stadium&#39;s center, I&#39;ll be able to jump down 
the entranceway&#39;s rooftop.

&quot;Stop her!&quot; One of the bodyguards yelled.

Uh oh.

He was about to raise his gun when one of his comrades pushed his arm&#39;s 
back down.

&quot;We can&#39;t fire in the stadium! There are too many people.&quot;

&quot;Cue the screens!&quot; A worker called as I ran by the controls.

While he was preoccupied I snatched up a mike for myself. Wherever 
Manuke was, he wasn&#39;t going to be a happy little boy for much longer.

All around the stadium the giant video screens came up, all of them with 
Mina&#39;s face on it! The show was only starting much to my relief.

The blonde woman slowly brought the microphone up to her mouth. &quot;This 
song...was written by myself and a person very dear to me. I hope you 
will all enjoy yourselves.&quot;

A person very dear to her?

&quot;Go out with me!&quot;

I was snapped out of my thoughts when I spotted a guy up ahead 
continually calling out to Mina and to be quite honest, it was getting 
on my nerves!

As I ran by I hit him on the head shouting, &quot;Stuff it!&quot; Yes, it was the 
business way of handling things.

&quot;Yo dude...who was that hot chick who just clobbered you?&quot;

&quot;Oww...I don&#39;t know... But do you think she&#39;d go out with me?&quot;

The lights dimmed until only the center of the stage was lit up.

&#39;Cue the music!&quot;

This is it!

&quot;Can you find the real me?

Somewhere here, dreaming somewhere, hurting everywhere

For a far off memory...&quot;

Mina held her breath as did everyone else.

Tup!

I jumped up onto the middle platform.

&quot;Even if it would take until my last breath,
I will find you, my love,
for the illusion is nothing.
But we are, we&#39;re something&quot;

I didn&#39;t need to see the screens...because I could feel her relief from 
where I stood. Her eyes were tearing bit as the lights in the stadium 
revealed my location. Two lights in the darkness, that&#39;s how many would 
see us, yet it wasn&#39;t true, not entirely...because Mina-chan was my only 
light. Whatever the circumstances were between us, I knew that much was 
true.

Together we finished the last of the slow part,

&quot;If you believe in me, in us,
Then our eternity can be real.&quot;

I ran down the platform as the music began to pick up, my own heart 
beating strong in my ears. I didn&#39;t care if I was showing off, I didn&#39;t 
care that the crowd was whistling and cheering...there was only one 
person that mattered to me.

TUP!

&quot;Woah, did you see that flip?&quot;

I landed beside Mina. Momentarily we exchanged knowing glances before we 
jumped into the next steps of our routine, leading into what would be a 
very successful performance. A rule in life, if you do something good by 
accident, go with it and make people think it was supposed to happen.

The song came to a brief instrumental portion. As planned, I spun and 
then twist, to where Mina came into my waiting arms. (Up yours Manuke!) 
I couldn&#39;t help but grin at the thought.

&quot;That was perfect Rei-chan.&quot; Mina softly giggled. &quot;Quite the entrance if 
I may add.&quot;

&quot;Did you ever doubt me?&quot; I whispered back.

&quot;Never.&quot; She then threw back her head and arched her back in my arms, 
bringing me to step forward to lean over her accordingly.

In response the crowd made &#39;ooh&#39; and &#39;ahh&#39; noises, absolutely eating our 
performance up.

Somewhere in the manager&#39;s room...


&quot;ARRRRRRRRRRGH!&quot; Manuke gritted he teeth at a maddening pace.

An unlucky bodyguard happened to stumble in to report at the wrong time. 
The middle-aged man ran one of his free hands through the back of his 
hair, nervously as he was about to deliver their group&#39;s failure. &quot;Umm, 
sir, that girl you told us to kill, well...she kind of...escaped.&quot;

Manuke slowly turned around in his chair, away from the eighteen 
television screens that each played the concert performance live. His 
face twisted, eyes flaring up with unspeakable anger. &quot;YOU DON&#39;T SAY?&quot;

&quot;S-sir, now there&#39;s no need to become violent. I-I-uh oh.&quot;

WHACK-A-POW!

Concert end
