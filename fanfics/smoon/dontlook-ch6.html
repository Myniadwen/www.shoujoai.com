<h1>Don't Look Back (part 6 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dontlook-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&#147;What exactly was that?&#148; Derek murmured quietly as he sat down in 
Haruka&#146;s plush leather chair, taking on an irritated look that fit his 
mood perfectly.

&#147;You saw what it was. I know you&#146;re a grown man with a taste for 
women, you can&#146;t exactly say you don&#39;t know what I was doing&#148; Haruka 
slid in smoothly, causing Derek to relax at her player-like attitude.

&#147;I didn&#146;t mean to overstep my bounds Mr. Ten&#39;oh. Forgive my rudeness. 
We need to discuss a few things before we leave next week. Now, 
transportation is all set up. Busses for the girls arrive next Friday 
at 8 in the morning and we hit the first beach the next morning. Now, 
which lines of clothes shall I have ready&#133;?&#148;

Haruka sighed, relaxing in the chair opposite her assistant, waiting 
patiently for the meeting to end so she could rescue Michiru from her 
secretary&#146;s teasing&#133;



&#147;And then she called here and told me to set up your contract! She 
really likes you ya know.&#148; the bubbly brunette giggled as Michiru&#146;s 
face flushed slightly. They&#146;d been talking for nearly an hour as they 
waited for Haruka to come back.

&#147;So does everyone know that she&#146;s&#133;well, female?&#148; the aqua haired girl 
asked, averting her face as she changed the subject. Chelle smirked, 
but let it go, sliding onto the desk in one neat move.

&#147;No way. I know because I&#146;ve been around her since grade school. 
Photography is still a mainly male dominated field, so Haruka&#146;s looks 
get her far. Everyone thinks she&#146;s a guy. Except Usagi and the girls. 
And a couple others you&#146;ll meet pretty soon. In fact, if you hang with 
me, I&#146;ll introduce them to you. There&#146;s a meeting for the girls and 
the crew in an hour. Oops!&#148; Chelle giggled, looking at her watch, 
&#147;make that 10 minutes. I never thought talking could be so much fun. 
Then again, I have a feeling being on your good side will come in 
handy in the future&#133;near future&#133;&#148; the woman murmured cryptically, 
sliding off the desk before snatching up a clip board, motioning for 
the door.

Michiru sighed, wondering how they could all deal with such a fast 
paced life as she followed her newest friend out the door, into the 
large room that she&#146;d come from an hour ago. She blinked slightly as 
the sound of soft laughter rang out as they stepped into the room. She 
was surprised with the site of a group of women and men milling around 
the spacious room.

&#147;When did they come?&#148; she asked as Chelle giggled beside her, twirling 
a curl around one graceful finger as she gazed with fondness at most 
in the room, blushing as one of the two blond men by the windows 
winked at her. The other, his blond hair spiked with gel, wearing 
baggy pants and a clean white buttoned shirt, seemed at odds with the 
first, who wore a well- tailored suit, his blond hair slicked back 
from his face.

&#147;Those are Mike and Taylor.&#148; Chelle murmured, saying the latter name 
with a slight swoon in her voice.

&#147;Chelle! Hello darling!&#148; A soft voice called out, a slight British 
accent curling around each word, causing Michiru to smile. Chelle did 
too as they turned to see a young woman with fiery copper tresses 
framing a sweet face and sharp steel grey eyes, denying anyone the 
chance to think her anything but what she was.

&#147;Michiru, I&#146;d like you to meet Lilica Johnson. Lil, this is the new 
girl, Michiru.&#148; Chelle introduced them, glancing up as the two shook 
hands, a dreamy look coming to her eyes as a charming smile curved her 
lips, &#147;hey Mike&#133;Taylor&#148; she murmured, a seductive note in her voice as 
she spoke the lightly blushing boy&#146;s name.

&#147;Michiru hmmm? Nice to meet you.&#148; A husky voice laughed beside her, 
causing her to jump before looking up at the man who looked almost 
exactly like Haruka, except for the spiked hair and baggy jeans.

&#147;Michiru, this is my partner, Mike. She&#146;s Haruka&#146;s cousin&#148; Lil 
murmured, causing Michiru to gape at her before glancing back at Mike, 
who was laughing softly as she wrapped her arms around the British 
girls waist, bestowing a light kiss to her forehead. &#145;Must be in the 
family.&#146; She thought before several other greetings took her attention 
as she met with lighting crew, set up, and other parts of the vast 
company&#133;.



Haruka sighed with relief as she looked down at her watch, a smile 
curving her lips as she held up her hands to interrupt Derek in the 
middle of his rant on the DSC team. Apparently he thought Lil and Mike 
were replaceable.

&#147;Derek, buddy, our meeting.&#148; The blond reminded, standing up and 
stretching the stiffness from her joints.

&#147;Right. Lets go then.&#148; The man across from her murmured, getting up 
with an irritated grumble, still obviously upset with whatever stunt 
Lil had talked Mike and her secretary into doing. For some reason, the 
two British didn&#146;t get along as well as they once did. (An: sorry Dev, 
but it fits the story, you&#146;ll see! *singsong voice*)

Walking to the large wooden doors, Haruka swung them open, earning 
dead silence as she walked over to where Michiru was, sitting on one 
of the couches, surrounded by crew members. Haruka groaned as she 
looked around the room, not seeing the five faces she should have. Her 
models.

&#147;We&#146;re here! We&#146;re not late! I&#146;m sorry!&#148;

Haruka winced, fearing for her doors as Usagi, followed by four 
others, came flying into the room. Her eyes widened slightly as one 
more figure poked her head into the room, her long forest green hair 
spilling around her shoulders.

&#147;Setsuna, my dear, I&#146;m glad you could make it.&#148; Haruka heard Derek 
drawl from behind her. The older woman blushed, her magneta eyes 
snapping with fire as she walked stiffly to the couches, plunking 
herself down beside Michiru with a slight smile in the dazed girls 
direction.

&#147;Lighten up Derek. Now,&#148; Haruka started, turning her attention to the 
crowd, &#147;I&#146;m glad you all made it. I&#146;d like you to meet our newest 
model, Michiru! Come up here Miss Kaioh.&#148;

Michiru blushed, but stood up, dutifully walking up the two stairs out 
of the sunken area to take Haruka&#146;s proffered hand.

&#147;Michiru, I&#146;d like you to meet the other models, Ami Mizuno, Minako 
Aino, Rei Hino, and Makoto Kino.&#148;

The four girls stepped forward, each wearing a kimono that just seemed 
to FIT. The first, a shy looking girl with short blue hair and 
sparkling blue eyes smiled, taking her hand in a firm grip before 
stepping back to let a tall brunette with dark green eyes say hello. 
The next was a bubbly blond, her light blue eyes seeming to laugh as 
she took on a comically dramatic pose, dropping to her knee and 
kissing the blushing Michiru&#146;s hand.

&#147;She&#146;s an actress.&#148; Haruka murmured helpfully in her ear, making 
Michiru smile. The last girl was a tall raven-haired beauty with cold 
looking violet eyes. She stepped forward, but simply bowed before 
walking back to her friends.

&#147;That was Rei, she&#146;s a very suspicious girl. She&#146;ll warm up to you 
when she gets to know you better. And finally, my two leading ladies, 
whom I&#146;ve missed terribly. Usagi, and Setsuna. They&#146;re co-managers of 
the photo shoots.&#148; The blond finally said, giving a satisfied grin as 
the last two met, Setsuna giving her a knowing look before leading 
Michiru back to the couches, Usagi staying up with Haruka and Derek.

&#147;Now, does anyone have a problem with being ready by Friday at 8? No? 
Good. Any questions? No? Good! So, mill around, enjoy your last week 
before putting your noses to the grindstone!&#148; Haruka chirped, earning 
several groans and &#145;boos&#146;.

Leaving the bulk of the &#145;people&#146; work to Derek, Haruka jumped down the 
two steps, smiling down at Michiru regretfully.

&#147;I&#146;m afraid I&#146;ve got to go back to my office, but Setsuna is going to 
introduce you to the line of suits with the other girls, and Usagi has 
offered to take you shopping, talk to Chelle about your new ID and 
timetables, and&#133;if you need a place to stay, my place is free for your 
use.&#148; Haruka finished lamely, handing the blushing girl a small 
plastic card, &#147;the floor above this one is my apartment. Just use that 
card, and&#133;yea. I&#146;ll see ya later&#133;maybe&#148;

Michiru watched with a dazed look as the blond turned, walking out of 
the room into her office as someone laughed from behind her.

&#147;Boy, has she got it bloody bad&#148; Lil giggled, nudging Setsuna, who 
simply smiled reassuringly at Michiru.

&#147;So, Are we going shopping or what?!&#148; the girl known as Usagi chimed 
in, getting a chorus of agreements and cheers from the other models 
and Lil as Mike and the other men gracefully (or bluntly) backed out, 
each knowing the chances they took in going shopping. Usagi scowled 
slightly before doing a once over on Michiru&#146;s slightly grubby jeans 
and dirty white shirt. Her figure was fine. Like all the other model&#146;s 
she&#146;d seen, but there was something in Michiru&#146;s eyes, a fear, or 
strength, that just seemed to add to her allure. Usagi sighed, shaking 
her head before slipping an arm through Michiru&#146;s, starting in on her 
favorite subject as the small group left.

Mamoru.
