/Quick flash back./


@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;

Makoto looks around the room, glowing with anticipation and pride. She 
and Ami had nearly single handedly tracked down the outers and stars 
and got them all to come back for Christmas. She even got Luna, 
Artemis and Momoko to agree to stay in their human forms for the day. 
They cooked the Christmas dinner and were having the party at Dr. 
Tomoe&#146;s mansion.

Everyone had showed up. Rei had Naru, Minako had Natsuna and Setsuna 
had Dr. Tomoe himself. The senshi&#146;s parents were there too, of course.

&#147;This is great.&#148; Makoto grins.

&#147;Of course it is.&#148; Ami agrees, taking out a tray of sandwiches. Makoto 
grabs her from behind and brushes her lips at the base of her neck. 
She swiftly lets go and spins her around. Makoto expertly takes the 
tray and walks around, serving them like a true hostess. She and Ami 
weren&#146;t exactly &#145;out&#146;. They hadn&#146;t told anyone really. Just let them 
guess.

&#147;That&#146;s my food!&#148; Ami picks up a wet wad of paper and hurls it across 
the room, hitting Makoto on the forehead. The wad sticks. A giggle 
bubbles up and through her mouth. &#147;Bull&#146;s eye.&#148; She mumbles, quickly 
returning to the kitchen.

&#147;Hm...&#148; Makoto wipes the water and soaked paper off her face. She 
turns to find both Usagi and Minako grinning at her. &#147;What?&#148; They both 
become innocent little girls and start talking as though they never 
stopped. &#145;There is definitely more to them than meets the eye.&#146;

&#147;When can we open presents?&#148; Usagi whines childishly. She, Minako, 
Chibi-usa, Hotaru and even Momoko pout, all putting on their best 
puppy dog looks. Laughter bubbles beneath the surface.

&#147;When the father clock strikes-&#147;

Bong! Everyone turns to the clock in unison. Bong! Makoto walks over 
to the clock curiously. Bong! &#145;the last time I checked it was only 
four thirty something.&#146; Bong! &#147;Setsuna!&#148; Makoto turns around as the 
last bong chimes. Everyone turns to the one in question.

&#147;What?&#148; Setsuna turns away to hide a grin. She kneels down and picks 
up a present. She reads the name then says it aloud. &#147;KoUsako!&#148; 
Chibi-usa blushes and walks to the front of the room. She takes the 
present and opens it. It was a hand-made pink bunny. Smiling, she 
skips to the back where Hotaru was. Setsina takes the next present and 
reads the name. &#147;Cherie?&#148; 

&#147;That&#146;s me.&#148; Makoto walks from the window and takes the present. She 
turns to leave and almost trips on Setsuna. &#147;Whoa!&#148; She dances around 
her and decides to stay in the opening.

&#147;Open it!&#148; Haruka yells from the back.

&#147;Alright, already.&#148; Makoto tears the wrapping off. In side was a 
sinister green, knitted sweater with an emerald dragon snaking around. 
&#147;Thank you, Edwina...&#148; Makoto whispers. Smiling, she pulls it on. It 
was a perfect fit. [It was made by Edwina.] The voice reminds. Makoto 
shakes her head ruefully and starts off.

&#147;To...Emerald?&#148; Setsuna looks at Makoto curiously.

&#147;T-that&#146;s me...&#148; Makoto turns back around and walks back to Setsuna. 
She takes the large, square box and unwraps it. She pulls out the 
shredding and discards them carelessly. Once clear, she pulls out 
another box and blinks. It was an unmarked white box. &#147;Huh?&#148; Makoto 
looks closer and reads the writing. &#147;Uh...Ami.&#148; 

&#147;What?&#148; Ami slowly makes her way to the front of the room, eyeing 
everyone suspiciously, especially Haruka. She takes the flat, unmarked 
box and slowly opens it. Makoto looks over her shoulder, peering into 
the box. Suddenly both of them get really red. Ami drops the box and 
walks away. Makoto just stands there, blushing, staring at the 
lingerie scattered on the floor. Makoto slowly turns and follows Ami.


&#147;I-I have to say, that that was embarrassing.&#148; Ami gulps down a cup of 
orange juice pours, gulps and pours again. 

&#147;That was Lea.&#148; Makoto growls, moving to pour herself a drink. &#147;I just 
know it. She said she&#146;d get me for it.&#148;

&#147;For what?&#148; Ami takes the jug and walks over to the table.

&#147;I was working in the barn as...as Jupiter.&#148; Makoto admits ruefully. 
She gulps one drink and pours herself another. &#147;I told her not to come 
in there until I was finished but she wouldn&#146;t listen.&#148;

&#147;Lea? That&#146;s the one you got the cow to chase after, right?&#148; Ami 
starts laughing. She had read it in Makoto&#146;s journal and had been 
greatly amused. &#147;Miss Paishk is a crafty little thing, isn&#146;t she?&#148;

&#147;Sure is.&#148; Makoto smirks at the memory. Remembering something, Makoto 
reaches into her hidden pocket and pulls out a long blue velvet box. 
&#147;Hey, Ami?&#148;

&#147;Yeah?&#148;

&#147;Promise you wont get all weird about this okay?&#148; Makoto meets Ami&#146;s 
cautious look with one of her own. &#147;I know we said slow but...&#148; She 
takes the box and slides it across the table. Ami stays still, 
watching Makoto. A very, very slow grin crosses her face. &#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Here.&#148; Ami pulls out a green velvet box and slides it across the 
table. &#147;I was wondering if I should give it to you this Christmas or 
wait for a while.&#148; Ami shakes her head and laughs. She opens the box 
curiously. In it was an elegant chain made of white gold, a sapphire 
mercury symbol and a separate gold band. Taking a deep breath, Ami 
looks closer. The inside of the ring had &#145;Beauty of Water&#146; engraved in 
it.

Like Ami&#146;s, in the box was a white gold chain, an emerald Jupiter 
symbol and a gold ring. &#145;Serenity of Wood&#146; was engraved inside. Makoto 
laughs, wiping the tears from her eyes. &#147;They do say that &#145;that great 
minds think alike&#146;.&#148;

&#147;Yeah...&#148; Ami smiles while checking to see if the ring fit. As 
expected, it does. She looks up at Makoto and kisses her. &#147;I love 
you.&#148;

&#147;Aishiteru.&#148; Makoto puts the necklace on and tucks it comfortably 
beneath her clothes. Ami does the same and stands up. Taking her cup, 
she and Makoto walk out of the kitchen, arm-in-arm. &#147;Are you okay, 
then?&#148;

&#147;Huh? Oh, you mean the lingerie.&#148; Ami purrs seductively, bringing a 
blush to Makoto&#146;s cheeks. Ami pulls Makoto&#146;s face closer. &#147;Actually, 
I&#146;d prefer to see you in nothing but the necklace I got you.&#148; She 
steps back, winks and disappears into the crowd.

&#147;Hnthanks a lot, much.&#148; Makoto grumbles to herself. 

&#147;Makoto!&#148; Haruka grins, waving the flat, white, unmarked box. 

&#147;HARUKA!!&#148; Makoto blushes fiercely, glaring at Haruka from across the 
room. She stalks across the room, stimulating fear into Haruka by the 
mere way she carried herself. &#147;I swear I&#146;m burning these.&#148; Makoto 
snatches the box and opens it. Inside was a green evening gown. &#147;I 
hate you.&#148;

&#147;I know.&#148; Haruka grins arrogantly and points across the room. Makoto 
turns around. All the senshi were in dress colours that best 
represented their planets. Ami was missing though. &#147;She&#146;s changing.&#148; 
Haruka looks down at her box, grimacing. &#147;I&#146;ve got to, ah...change. 
Setsuna made these dresses herself.&#148;

&#147;Hah!&#148; Makoto loops her arm in Haruka&#146;s and drags her to the 
washrooms. &#147;You&#146;ve got to where a dress. But.&#148; She says, before Haruka 
could snap at her. &#147;But, I&#146;ve expected this and asked Setsuna 
to...make them so they better fit the personalities.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s that supposed to mean?&#148; Haruka walks through the doors with 
Makoto and starts undressing. Makoto does the same but with a bit more 
reserve. 

&#147;Meaning I&#146;ve got her to make you a more masculine...thing.&#148; Makoto 
waves her hand, pulling the dress up her curvaceous hips. &#147;Ami helped 
with the design so you should really thank her. I just made the 
suggestion.&#148;

&#147;Cool.&#148; Haruka pulls up men&#146;s, sandy gold dress pants. She buttons up 
a white blouse and then the black vest. She already had the dress 
shoes so she didn&#146;t have to worry about that.

&#147;She also told me to give you this.&#148; Makoto turns around and shows her 
a choker with a golden cross on it. &#147;Turn around.&#148; Haruka listens 
obediently. Makoto clasps it and circles Haruka. She whistles 
appreciatively. &#147;Nice.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s this?&#148; Haruka points to the emerald Jupiter sign.

&#147;What does it look like?&#148;

&#147;It...just sit down.&#148; Haruka zips up the back of the dress as Makoto 
sits down. She unties Makoto&#146;s hair and lets it fall. Taking a brush, 
Haruka runs it through her hair. Finally satisfied, Haruka reties 
Makoto&#146;s hair into another ponytail. By the burette, Haruka fluffs it 
out a little. Seeing Makoto&#146;s questioning gaze, Haruka lowers her head 
next to hers and looks at her in the mirror. &#147;I have a wife too you 
know.&#148;

&#147;Yeah...&#148; Makoto blushes again and stands up, playing with the gold 
ring on her finger. She takes her normal clothes and folds them 
quickly. She looks at herself in the mirror. She had to admit; she 
looked great. The dress was a dark green. Kind of like Setsuna&#146;s hair; 
it looked black but when the light hits it, you could clearly see the 
green. &#147;I&#146;m ready.&#148; 

&#147;Then lets go.&#148; Haruka takes Makoto&#146;s hand and loops it in her arm. 
She walks towards the door and stops with her hand on the knob. &#147;You 
know, I&#146;m actually nervous.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s good.&#148; Makoto smiles up at her gently. &#147;That&#146;s a good thing 
Ruka. To be able to make each other nervous even after years of 
marriage. To take each other&#146;s breath away just by walking into a room 
and that a touch,&#148; Makoto brings clasps her hand over her heart. &#147;Can 
make your heart leap or skip a beat.&#148; She sighs.

&#147;That&#146;s good.&#148; Haruka whispers, entranced and smiling. &#147;Where&#146;d you 
learn all that?&#148;

&#147;My mother.&#148; Makoto smiles. Shaking her head, she opens the door 
herself. Mood broken, she laughs. &#147;She was a hopeless romantic and I 
guess I inherited it.&#148; Makoto scans the room for Ami but doesn&#146;t find 
her. So she turns back to Haruka. &#147;She used to tell me that when ever 
I was feeling lonely or sad.&#148;

&#147;You wouldn&#146;t mind me telling that to Michi, would you?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Makoto shakes her head slowly. &#147;Speaking of which, go.&#148; She 
untangles her arms and gives Haruka a light push. &#147;Sweep her off her 
feet and tell her how you feel.&#148;

&#147;How I feel?&#148;

&#147;Yeah. Be poetic about the whole thing, too. Either that or play her a 
song.&#148; The dreamy blush and smile sneaks across her face. &#147;Tell her 
that...&#148; The smile fades but the blush stays. Makoto&#146;s arms fall limp 
at her sides. &#147;Ami...&#148; Standing a top the stairs was Ami. She seemed 
to be wearing all black except for the white shirt. The suit was made 
to fit her curves. The blue rose in her suit&#146;s front pocket brought 
out the blue in the suit itself.

&#147;Makoto.&#148; Ami walks down the steps, through a crowd and walks to 
Makoto&#146;s side. &#147;I wasn&#146;t&#146;-humph!&#148; Makoto cuts her off with a kiss. 
Ami&#146;s wide eyes flutter closed and she brings her arms up around 
Makoto&#146;s neck, pulling her closer. Makoto pulls back, leaving Ami 
breathless. Around them, their friends were whistling and cheering. 
&#147;So much for subtly...&#148; Ami grins. She clears her throat and steps 
back. &#147;You look...&#148; Ami blushes. &#147;Beautiful.&#148;

&#147;Thanks.&#148; Makoto clasps her left hand in her right, noting that Ami 
was doing the same. &#147;I love you.&#148; She whispers, releasing her hand. 
She was wearing the wedding ring, Ami realized. She smiles brightly 
and takes Makoto&#146;s hand.

&#147;I love you too.&#148; She bows low, kissing Makoto&#146;s golden ring. &#147;So...&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re engaged to be engaged?&#148; Makoto grins.

&#147;Guess so. Dance?&#148; Ami offers Makoto her arm.

&#147;Yes.&#148; Makoto curtsies then laughs. Both she and Ami hurry onto the 
dance floor like two kids in a playground.

That&#146;s how Christmas went for them. It was by far, the best any of 
them ever had. First the casual lunch, presents then a formal dinner 
and dancing, either or. Even new years was a blast. All of the senshi 
and stars got together at the park. Where everything always seems to 
start. They had to dodge cops for an hour but Makoto and Ami thought 
it was all fun. 

Just like being engaged to be engaged is.

@;-&gt;--

25 August 2015

Makoto wakes up covered in sweat. She wipes her tears away and 
collapses back into bed. She glances over at her clock. It was only 
3:43 a.m. which meant if she went back to sleep, she&#146;ll have an even 
harder time sleeping tonight. If she stayed up, she&#146;ll be grumpy and 
her friends will ask what&#146;s wrong. 

Makoto squeezes her eyes shut, hoping against hope that it wasn&#146;t just 
a dream. A soft hand brushes back her bangs. Makoto opens her eyes and 
looks up into green eyes. &#147;Fiona, what are you doing up?&#148; 

&#147;I heard you crying, mama.&#148; Fiona crawls under the blankets and pops 
her head up between her and Ami.

&#147;Another nightmare?&#148; Ami gently brushes Makoto&#146;s tears away. &#147;I&#146;m 
here, my love.&#148; Ami watches Makoto through half lidded eyes as she 
leans over Fiona to close the distance. She presses their lips 
together in a gentle, experimental kiss. Ami moves her face away and 
licks her lips. &#147;You still taste like cookies.&#148; She comments, 
grinning.

&#147;Ewe.&#148; Fiona wrinkles her nose and disappears beneath the covers. 
&#147;I&#146;ll be in my room, down the hall.&#148; She walks towards the doors and 
stops. &#147;Actually I think I&#146;ll sleep downstairs.&#148; She closes the door 
in time for the pillow to miss.

&#147;This is definitely not a dream.&#148; Makoto pulls Ami&#146;s body close to 
hers. Through the fabric of their gowns, Makoto could feel the Jupiter 
and Mercury symbols pressing into her chest. &#147;I love you.&#148; She 
whispers against Ami&#146;s lips. Both she and Ami move closer so they were 
both lying in the middle, in each other&#146;s arms. &#147;You&#146;re stuck with me 
now, Aims.&#148;

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t have it any other way.&#148; Ami raises her head and kisses the 
base of Makoto&#146;s neck. &#147;Aishiteru, Koto.&#148;

@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;

Heh heh. I&#146;m done. This is actually the first story I&#146;ve finished in a 
long time. That said; tell me what you think. Good/Bad = Tell. Oh 
yeah. This is my first yuri fan fiction ever.</pre>
