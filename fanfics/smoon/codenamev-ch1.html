<h1>Codename: Sailor V (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;So what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Minako Aino asked her agent,
the lovely blonde raising her eyebrow. The star of a
popular television series called Codename: Sailor V,
along with being a singer and dancer, she was an idol
of growing popularity.

&quot;The threats are picking up in frequency,&quot; Setsuna
Meiou said crisply, her long greenish black hair
flowing like a wave around her. She waved a plastic
bagged sheet of paper as she calmly said, &quot;I&#39;m getting
worried.&quot;

Minako frowned, &quot;What did the police say?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve taken the letters and will look into it,&quot;
Setsuna said, &quot;but they don&#39;t sound hopeful. They did
make an interesting suggestion, however.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Minako looked curious.

&quot;Temporarily hiring on a bodyguard, at least until
they catch up with whoever is doing this,&quot; Setsuna
said calmly.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Minako said quickly, &quot;I am not having some
man following me around, supposedly for my own
protection.&quot;

&quot;Then why not a woman?&quot; Setsuna offered.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Minako blinked.

Several hours later a young woman bowed slightly, her
short, almost purple-black hair going well with her
violet eyes. &quot;My name is Hotaru Tomoe,&quot; she said
serenely, &quot;it&#39;s good to meet you both.&quot; Wearing a
simple black dress she looked gently elegant, yet she
also seemed very sure of herself despite her youth.

&quot;You were recommended by the police,&quot; Setsuna said
thoughtfully, &quot;but I was wondering how much experience
you had?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m older than I look,&quot; Hotaru calmly reassured her,
&quot;and I&#39;ve had my private investigator&#39;s license for
almost a year now.&quot;

&quot;I checked into your references,&quot; Setsuna conceded,
&quot;they&#39;re very good.&quot;

Minako had to smile, thinking that despite her age
Hotaru looked like about the right age to be a member
of her fan club. &quot;Do you understand what the job is to
be?&quot; she asked Hotaru curiously.

Hotaru looked at her, her eyes almost like pools of
purest violet. &quot;It sounds fairly straight forward,&quot;
she answered, &quot;I&#39;m to shadow you in case this stalker
tries to take a shot at you.&quot;

&quot;I should warn you that there are going to be some
pretty long days involved,&quot; Minako pointed out calmly,
&quot;I act, sing and make public appearances.&quot;

&quot;You might want to hold off on appearing in public,&quot;
Hotaru said reasonably, &quot;it would make protecting you
somewhat easier.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Minako shook her head, &quot;I committed to these
appearances months ago, and I can&#39;t easily back out
now.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ll just have to figure out a way to have me
keep an eye on you without standing out too much,&quot;
Hotaru shrugged.

&quot;Considering she&#39;ll be in full Sailor V costume it&#39;ll
be hard to stay close and not stand out,&quot; Setsuna
calmly noted.

Minako was looking at Hotaru thoughtfully, checking
her out from head to toe. &quot;You know,&quot; she finally
murmured, &quot;I think I have an idea.&quot;

Hotaru blinked at Minako, looking over at her warily.
&quot;I don&#39;t think I like the look on your face,&quot; she
finally said.

Minako chuckled, &quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;

The next week was interesting for the two women, to
say the least. Minako went to the studio, worked on
ads and held her personal appearances, and in the
background Hotaru quietly followed. Remarkably she
blended in very well; carrying Minako&#39;s personal
planner and looking much like a professional
assistant, not a bodyguard. They talked together,
forced to spend their time side by side, and quickly
discovered they enjoyed each other&#39;s company.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I appreciated how busy an idol is,&quot;
Hotaru murmured as they drove to the studio to record
an ad for the Sailor V special.

&quot;Out at four in the morning most days and back home by
ten at night if I&#39;m lucky,&quot; Minako agreed. She looked
stylish and elegant, but then again she almost always
did, due to good personal taste and fine clothes. She
looked at Hotaru thoughtfully, &quot;You&#39;ve been keeping up
fine, I notice.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hotaru flashed a rare smile. Normally the
young woman looked professionally grave, so it gave
Minako a flash of pleasure to see amusement on her
face. &quot;Private Eyes tend to work long hours too, so
I&#146;m used to it.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s up next?&quot; Minako asked.

Just like a real assistant Hotaru checked through the
schedule, &quot;We&#39;re going to see Setsuna-san first, then
there&#39;s a costume fitting.&quot; She frowned and asked, &quot;I
thought you already had several Sailor V costumes?&quot;

&quot;The costume isn&#146;t for me, it&#39;s for you,&quot; Minako
explained.

&quot;Ehh!&quot; Hotaru looked at Minako in confusion.

&#39;She&#39;s so cute when she&#39;s clueless,&#39; Minako realized.
She looked at Hotaru with amusement, &quot;Remember, we
need a way for you not to stand out when I appear in
costume.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Hotaru said weakly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Minako reassured her, &quot;it&#39;ll be
tasteful.&quot;

&quot;This from a woman who wears a schoolgirl sailor fuku
as part of her costume,&quot; Hotaru said wryly. &quot;So I get
put through this after we meet with Setsuna-san?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Minako agreed cheerfully.

&quot;I&#39;m doomed,&quot; Hotaru sighed.

The meeting with Setsuna showed that no new threats
had come in from the stalker, and then the three of
them were off for the costume fitting. With a feeling
of dread Hotaru followed the costumer, a tall woman
named Makoto, into the changing rooms where she helped
fit the young woman into her new outfit.

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Makoto asked her quietly, the brown
haired woman giving Hotaru a comforting smile.

&quot;No,&quot; Hotaru shrugged as she paused before the
curtain, &quot;but that&#39;s never stopped me.&quot;

Minako turned as she heard Hotaru step out, and then
froze. The sailor fuku was white and purple rather
than orange like hers and the boots were styled
different... but it was the cool reserve and intensity
in Hoare&#146;s eyes that carried it off. Deep down she was
a warrior, no matter how oddly she was dressed, and it
shone through.

&quot;Perfect,&quot; Setsuna murmured, studying Hotaru intently.

&quot;You haven&#39;t said anything,&quot; Hotaru finally looked
over at Minako wryly, &quot;does it really look that bad on
me?&quot;

&quot;You look great,&quot; Minako managed, looking at Hotaru in
admiration, &quot;It&#39;s perfect for the look we were
thinking of, too.&quot;

&quot;So I&#39;m wearing this to your performance tomorrow?&quot;
Hotaru asked.

&quot;Not just wearing,&quot; Setsuna grinned, &quot;you&#39;re
participating, too.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Hotaru protested.

The next afternoon the sun beat down at the park,
Sailor V posing dramatically as the band of monsters
gathered around her warily. &quot;There are too many for
me,&quot; Minako dramatically declared her white and orange
sailor fuku gleaming &quot;is there no one who can help
me?&quot;

The dramatic music swelled, and she arose as a
concealed lift brought the costume clad woman to the
top of a platform. Hotaru held the pole arm in one
slightly sweaty hand as the murmurs of the crowd rose
in surprise wondering who this new figure could be.

&quot;When evil threatens the innocent I will be there,&quot;
Hotaru declared, &quot;I, Sailor S!&quot; She leapt spinning the
wooden prop weapon as she dropped beside Sailor V, the
two going back to back against the enemies.

&quot;Nice entrance,&quot; Sailor V said dramatically.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Hotaru sweatdropped.
