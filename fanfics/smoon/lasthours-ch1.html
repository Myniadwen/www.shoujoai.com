<pre>Timeline: At the (bloody) end of Crystal Tokyo

******************************

Footsteps fell with heavy thuds, echoing through the once vast and 
beautiful hallways. There was nothing left of that. The crystal floor 
was cracked, the walls shattered, splinters and hug junks were making 
navigating alone a taxing task. The distant sound of fighting, the 
roar of battle - actually more like slaughter - could be heard all 
around us. The familiar sound of elemental forces crashing against 
each other. A wave of water extinguishing fire. Thunder rumbling as 
electricity discharged loudly through the air.
	They were distant, background sounds. Close by, I knew, but of 
no immediate concern. I could not let them impress me now or I would 
surely loose my resolve. Because with my resolve gone, so would be any 
hope of survival. And survival was everything that counted now. There 
was nothing left to fight for, nothing left to protect but our lives 
and that one last glimmer of hope.
	I looked over my shoulder, studying the grim and expressionless 
face of my companion, holding the last precious bundle in her arms 
that was left of our once great legacy. Her eyes though were a geyser 
of emotions, bordering on the roads that led to madness. Disbelief 
struggled against desperate control, the events of the last days and 
especially the last hours, I could see them replaying in the usually 
compassionate and vibrant eyes. What I saw now were the last traces of 
a warrior, a strong leader, only held together by very thin strings.
	Rounding a corner, I felt them before I saw them. Faces hidden 
in the thick crimson cloaks, they looked ominous and terrifying. A 
snarl overcame my stoic face briefly but was quickly exchanged for 
grim determination once again. They raised their hands, preparing 
spells, but they were by far not fast enough. Twirling my weapon I 
jumped into action, forcing myself not to feel remorse when the glaive 
went through bodies left and right. They deserved no better, the 
fools. For what they&#39;ve done, I should sent them all into eternal 
silence but that was not the way, not this time. I would so gladly 
have given into temptation, however, things were still holding me 
here, making me cling to life.
	In moments only the path was clear and we moved again, our boots 
resounding on the battered and cracked crystal floor. On our way to 
one of the secret tunnels under the palace that would leave us to 
safety opposition was plenty... and so were the bodies of friends and 
foes alike.
	I had seen a lot of things in my time, suppressing emotion was 
usually within my nature. A millennia spent among the life I was 
supposed to guard though had changed that nature. It took all my 
willpower now, sliding completely into my planetary aspect, in order 
to not throw up at the sight of gruesome disfigured bodies of those I 
called friends and comrades. Soldiers, scholars, servants...
	In one pathway both of us stopped. Just another corridor towards 
our goal but the sight that greeted us... I clenched my eyes shut for 
a moment. It was by far not the first, yet I had forced myself not to 
dwell too much on the terrible visions of dead teammates. I had known 
there was no one left but actually seeing them. Vesta and Pallas lay 
in a lake of dried blood, two spears ran through both of her bodies, 
fusing them together in a sadistic reflection of their inseparable 
love in life. All around lay figures, scorched and frozen men and 
women with cloaks, as well as other soldiers, their weapons either 
melted, rusted or frozen. It was obvious that the combined fury of the 
two younger Senshi had been devastating to their opponent&#39;s ranks. Yet 
in the end, it still wasn&#39;t enough.
	Shouts could be heard and I turned away sharply, blinking away a 
hot tear. They were on us again, more this time, both of the fractions 
this time as the red and blue cloaks indicated. Fury I had rarely ever 
felt before was burning like raging inferno inside of me. Purple 
energy exploded outwards and wisps of black and white hissed through 
the air, collecting more like angry snakes than ribbons at the tip of 
my glowing glaive.
	&quot;AETHER SPLIT!&quot; And with that infernal cry I brought down the 
glaive, letting go for a moment of all the anger and disappointment, 
the nagging sense of failure and the loathing unfairness. The space in 
between us and the inrushing enemies distorted when a chasm was ripped 
right through the very life force that sustained the planet, sniffling 
out any soul&#39;s light in its path.
	Panting hard, I closed my eyes briefly to catch my breath. But 
distant footsteps already announced new opposition. We had to move now 
or we would surely share the fates of those that lined the halls and 
corridors of the palace. I grabbed my companion who still stood 
motionless, staring at the pair of young Senshi, and dragged her along 
unresisting, still clutching the baby in her arms. We had to make it. 
This was the last deed that we owed to our Queen, our friends and all 
those fallen today. What came after that, I did not know and would 
only allow myself to think about when we had found safety. If such a 
place even existed anymore for us.

******************************

	They came in from all directions. To the hundred, to the 
thousandth. Banners waving in the air in their victory march. The sun 
was bathing the scenery in an ocean of flames. The sky was cloudless, 
beautiful if not for the stench of death and destruction that hang in 
the air. It was like the weather was mocking us. Not a single raindrop 
had fallen and all the clouds and lightning from the sky had been 
magical in nature, long gone, not needed anymore. The battle, the war, 
was over. They had won and we had lost, had been destroyed.
	I could still hardly believe it as we stood on the cliff 
overlooking what remained of the once mighty palace and the core of 
Crystal Tokyo. None of us had suspected this. Those two nations had 
always been at odds with each other, never seeing eye to eye. But 
suddenly they stood as one, their magic joined and unleashed upon what 
they believed to be the root of a thrall on humanity than all we had 
ever wanted was peace.
	&#39;How dare those hypocrites!&#39; Were they any better? We had stood 
over a millennia against the forces of darkness, fair and just. We had 
sacrificed our lives, our dreams for the greater good of humanity, 
bringing peace and order where once chaos reigned. We had stood firm 
against any opposition and now what?
	We had fallen to civil war.
	Destroyed by those we had sworn to protect, destroyed by 
fledglings with toys too dangerous for them to have. They did not 
understand at all what responsible came with it. That there was a 
price for everything. All they had ever wanted was more and more. And 
when we denied, with the wisdom gained in many centuries, they reacted 
like children denied ice cream. Pitiful.
	It would have been ridiculous if all those metaphors had not 
been played out on such a great scale. I felt myself once again 
confirmed in my belief that humans were not yet ready for powers such 
like that. They were best suited for those who understood the 
limitations of their possession. The results of action and the need 
for balance. Not like them, not like these barbarians who claimed to 
be the revolutionist of human evolution, striving to snap mankind&#39;s 
bonds.
	Bonds like us. Or so they thought in their childish naivety. I 
doubted they would reign long. Their greed and irresponsibility would 
lead them to a fast fall. This alliance was unstable already. As soon 
as the smoke of this battle cleared, they would once again be at each 
other&#39;s throats.
	Blonde hair swaying in a gentle evening breeze, Sailorvenus 
stood transfixed, her gaze locked on the ruins of the Crystal Palace 
now being fully claimed by the invading armies. But I doubted she saw 
all that. Her gaze had been distant, haunted, lost in the nightmarish 
scenes we had come across during our hasty escape. &quot;Why?&quot; she 
whispered, words almost lost in the wind. &quot;We didn&#39;t deserve that. How 
can they claim justice in this?&quot; She swallowed hard, aura blazing 
momentarily, as she cried out her anguish in a manner that made me 
shudder, &quot;HOW?&quot;
	Gently I reached for her arm, anticipating her to whirl on me. 
But the fire was lost already, the anguish gone. Only defeat and 
resignation remained. &quot;We have to go,&quot; I said, finding it hard to 
maintain a firm voice of reason at the loss I saw in normally 
beautiful eyes. They were all gone now. Every Senshi. I could not feel 
their souls anymore residing on this plane. Not even Selene... Only we 
remained, and the baby in our arms. The last tiny light left of the 
ones we had protected for so long. Our last duty.

******************************

	Night had fallen as I sat on the edge of the worn-out bed. The 
house we had found somewhere in the downtown areas of Crystal Tokyo 
was long vacated. Much like everything here. Time had sustained it, 
but barely. I doubted any of the antique equipment still worked and 
water was out of the questions. This part of town had always been home 
to vagabonds, bandits and outlaws, the labyrinth of crumbled houses 
and other such ruins serving as an adequate hiding place. Crystal 
Tokyo had never had much of the sort that lived here. Yet neither had 
we ever claimed to be perfect.
	The storm had come finally. Lightning flashing over the horizon 
as brutal winds tore at the land. The forces of nature finally 
unleashed their fury at the loss that had been experienced today. I 
hoped a few of Them would be struck down by lightning bolts... I 
doubted that would happen though. Information was just as dead here. 
Not that I cared about declarations of Their justified triumph over 
the &quot;slavers&quot; and the resulting &quot;liberating of mankind&quot;.
	Megalomaniac fools.
	I turned away from the storm&#39;s fury outside when I felt the 
presence of my lover enter the room. &quot;She is sleeping now,&quot; Venus said 
without much emotion, wearing a mask with so many cracks as the floor 
of the palace already had when we were escaping hours ago with only 
young Serenity III to push us onwards. I wished I knew what happened 
to Selene. There was still the distant hope that the child&#39;s older 
sister had been somewhere else when the united armies struck. It was a 
feeble hope to cling too, I knew. But what else was left? Nothing.
	&quot;We should move out early tomorrow. They are going to hunt for 
us,&quot; I commented frostily.
	Venus suddenly whirled around, eyes glaring with smoldering 
flames. &quot;Don&#39;t you care at all? Crystal Tokyo has just fallen. 
Everyone is dead, Usagi, everyone. Doesn&#39;t it bother you at all?!&quot; Her 
hands were shaking and I could see hot tears stinging in her eyes.
	&quot;Every beginning must have an end,&quot; I replied sadly, wishing to 
placate my own anguish with the words but horribly failing so.
	Venus was only further enraged. &quot;So that&#39;s what it is to you? 
Just another Silver Millennium, just another end of a cycle. How 
convenient.&quot; She spat, glaring at me with barely restraint disdain... 
and hate. Hate and love. So close they were. Barely ever anything ever 
served to taint my angel&#39;s love but when it did, it was a sight that 
would make the devil seek asylum in Heaven. I knew though, that it 
wasn&#39;t really directed at me. My lover right now was a ticking time 
bomb, a powder cog of suppressed emotions waiting to erupt any moment. 
Centuries of battle instincts had not permitted her to let go yet, 
disbelief further clouding the inevitable realization. It had to be 
released though, before it drove the beautiful blonde to madness. And 
that was something I could not permit. Losing her would be my own 
verdict.
	In the blink of an eye, I was in her face, my own eyes alive 
with a cold fire that made the - now former - leader of the guard 
flinch back. &quot;I thought you knew me better,&quot; I hissed in a deathly 
whisper. I was never one of many words or great speeches. I left that 
to my lover. There was never any real need to with us anyway.
	As soon as the words were out Venus reacted as if slapped, 
reeling back and turning around ashamed. &quot;I...&quot; She choked back a sob 
but tears were most likely already stinging her vision. &quot;I&#39;m sorry... 
I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; Silently I had come up behind her, wrapping my 
arms around her taller but at the moment yet so fragile form. &quot;I feel 
so helpless... and I wish... I wish I could have...&quot;
	I did not let her finish. Those words of defeat I would not 
allow to pass her lips. Turning her around I had her lips claimed by 
mine in a desperate onslaught. Venus gasped into the contact but 
relented freely. My hands were moving frantically, roaming her body as 
I pushed her back towards the bed. Foreplay was far from our mind as I 
pushed against the center of her uniform, the garb dissolving into 
bands of orange and shortly afterwards vanishing completely as its 
owner wished it away. With another push I brought the other woman down 
on the hard mattress, the old material screeching loudly in protest.
	I stood a moment, looking down at the Senshi of Love. Her eyes 
were half-open, glazed and expecting. Expecting of what she knew would 
come, what she wanted to come, what she needed to come. With but a 
thought I pulled the manacles from subspace, the cold metal clattering 
as it materialized on the material plane. Venus immediately 
outstretched her hands and the restricting items snapped shut around 
them. Once again the bed protested loudly when I let myself fall 
forward heavily, landing on my lover&#39;s naked form forcefully, legs 
positioned on either side and my upper body resting on her abandon. 
Roughly I took Venus confined hands and attached the two chains to the 
bedposts. Only a small whimper escaped the blonde, the need in blue 
eyes outweighing any discomfort.
	It would have shocked her followers had they ever known about 
this. Their strong brave idol. A fierce warrior, always in control, 
spreading love throughout the masses. But there was only so much 
control one could have, there was only so much one could give and give 
and give... It would all store inside and threaten to eat her from 
inside. And that was why she needed to relent control, that was why 
she needed to receive, to be at someone&#39;s else mercy without having 
the means to do anything herself.
	I understood and that was why we made such a perfect team. I 
would let her dominate in public, content to be at her side, but in 
the bedroom, roles would change. Willingly, necessary. Until her 
thirst, her need, was satisfied once more. Many thought her perfect, 
but I knew my lover, my sweet angel was all too human. All of us were. 
She had needs just like everyone else. Those needs might seem shocking 
to many... which was why they never truly understood her. I wondered 
if they ever truly understood any of us.
	And right now I was just as much in need of this as she was. My 
own mind was barely able to maintain reason. Everything was sliding 
slowly out of my grasp, just as the unimaginable situation all around 
us. I needed to reestablish control, dominance over my emotions, or we 
would just as well be dead before the night fell once more tomorrow. 
We needed to forget, to find a release for the magma stored inside of 
us before it exploded, ripping us apart in the process.
	A whimpering moan was caught in another hard kiss when I pulled 
her head up by the hair, pressing harder into her lower body with my 
weight. For some time I indulged in the power play of tongues, my own 
ravishing her mouth. I made to pull out and as expected Venus tongue 
desperately followed. I caught it between my teeth, making her cry out 
muffled once more. Pulling away with a resounding snap as I let go of 
her tongue, I moved down to her throat and then to her neck, nipping 
lightly even though I knew my lover craved it even harder.
	The hand entangled in her hair was removed as I let her head 
drop back on the mattress and it moved to join the other busy at 
Venus&#39; breasts. I slid down her body, making sure to crush my heat 
against hers, brief, fleetingly. My legs were still arranged so that 
she could not move her own and thus all that was left for her to do 
was tossing her head and upper body around as I began to massage the 
creamy flesh underneath my gloved palms, my tongue drawing a line from 
her throat, right in between the valley. I pinched each nipple once, 
applying a twist to the right and a tug to the other.
	&quot;Yesssss...&quot; Venus hissed sharply. &quot;More!&quot;
	She was close already. I could feel the explosion, the release 
that had been denied to her for much too long already. In a way, it 
was like a battery that needed recharging. But in my lover&#39;s case that 
recharge had to be forced. She would not allow it herself, giving and 
giving until she was spent but still not relenting. She could not. 
Only like this could she allow herself to feel her own need, only like 
this could she fully let go. I was both the source and the provider 
and I relished in that role.
	Pulling my head away for a moment, I grasped both of her nipples 
as if they were mere straps and pushed the mounds together. Venus&#39; 
upper body arched as the blonde Senshi let out a screech, the supple 
nubs of flesh sticking out even more. Not losing a moment, my mouth 
descended and teeth snapped down around the two nubs, digging into the 
flesh of the pressed together breasts right away. Venus cries 
escalated. I could feel the power bubbling now. She was about ready.
	I let go of her breasts, causing them to strain immediately 
against the hold of lips, yet I would not relinquish the grip. Knowing 
that my lover was on the verge of release already, I did not waste 
another moment. With one hand I pried her lower lips apart, not 
permitting her legs to spread wider though. The material of my 
uniform&#39;s glove pressed into soft flesh as I held the passage open on 
both ends and just below her clit. With a quick jab three fingers 
entered the swelling lake inside, quickly joined by a fourth. I could 
hear Venus chanting my name, the floodgates inside beginning to break. 
Only another moment now.
	In perfect harmony with the final break I pulled back my hand, 
curling it together into a fist and thrust forward as deep as 
possible. The body beneath me quaked as orange light erupted. I had to 
let go of her breast so, that I could manage the spasms of my lover. 
Sliding upwards, I buried my hand deeper inside of her as the wave 
washed over us. My mouth found hers once more and I pushed the entire 
weight of my own body onto hers once more, preventing Venus to jump 
right out of the bed. My own fuku dissolved under the intensity, only 
my gloves remaining as my hand thrust in and out her relentlessly, 
doubling, tripling the ecstatic release of my lover. My own chest 
pressed into her just moments before abused one.
	That was when I heard the snap and moments later felt hands wrap 
around my back, fingernails digging deep into the flesh beneath them, 
as they raked downwards. My own core exploded when one of Venus&#39; knees 
snapped upwards, all but ramming into it. I grinded downwards in 
automatic response, my head spinning from the force but readily 
accepting the overwhelming pleasure that came with it.
	I grunted into her mouth, sliding my hand free from between her 
legs. Venus&#39; hands had reached my butt now, kneading, scratching the 
flesh. I slipped one leg over Venus&#39;, entrapping it once more and 
started a wild rhythm against her core once more, this time with my 
own joining into the dance.
	Now it was pure Senshi mating and for a short time at least the 
tragedy of this day was forgotten as two souls released their anguish 
and frustration in a purifying display of love that would hold them on 
the path of sanity. Barely.

******************************

	It was over an hour later that we lay in the pale moonlight. The 
storm had calmed down once more but it was only temporary, I could 
feel it. Soft, even breathing tickled my neck as my mate basked in the 
afterglow of our joining. Somehow she had ended up on top in the end, 
but that hardly mattered to me. My arms were secure around her taller 
frame as Venus had her head buried in my short dark hair.
	Eventually, after minutes of silence that began to change from 
tranquil to thick once more, the blonde woman spoke eventually, &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe it&#39;s all gone. We protected them, all these years, a 
whole millennia. And this is their gratitude?&quot;
	I sighed heavily, my heart breaking at the memories that were on 
the edges of my awareness. &quot;The true danger to a great empire always 
comes from within. And that is a danger that they all fall prey to in 
the end.&quot; When I had awakened as Saturn at the end of the Silver 
Millennium, I had known this bitter truth already. That time, it had 
only made me a little sad. I had never been really connected with this 
age. Now though... I could still see it clearly and doubted it would 
ever go away. Elios fallen, bravely trying to protect us when they 
took the throne room. The Queen had been too shocked to even react, to 
draw on the power of her crystal. Diana had pressed the young princess 
into Venus&#39; arms and told us to escape, moments later leaping to her 
mistress&#39; and wife&#39;s aid... or more like following her into certain 
death. It hurt, it hurt so much to remember and I could not allow 
myself to really give into all that was in my heart. Weeping and 
grieving would have to come later.
	&quot;What will we do now?&quot; Venus asked, not questioning further on 
my words.
	I stroked gently through blonde strands that were currently in 
disarray, covered in sweat from our lovemaking. &quot;We have to get out of 
the city and then someplace where we can leave the Princess.&quot; Venus 
lifted her head, protest burning in her eyes. &quot;We can&#39;t take her with 
us,&quot; I replied calmly, inwardly hating the fact just as much as she 
did. &quot;They&#39;ll hunt us and that is no life for a child.&quot;
	Blue eyes closed defeated. &quot;Kuso,&quot; Venus cursed.
	&quot;After that,&quot; I continued answering her initial question. &quot;We 
find some place, somewhere remote and far away. Just for us...&quot; I was 
quiet for a moment before adding, &quot;They would have wanted us too.&quot;
	&quot;As long as we stay together,&quot; the Senshi of Love agreed with a 
shaking voice. Her hands clung to my body harder now, blue eyes 
meeting mine and sharing the same basic truth there. We were the only 
ones left and neither would want to go on without the other. There was 
nothing left to live for once we fulfilled that last mission. All that 
would be left was us then. I wondered how long love would sustain our 
will to live.
	I stroked my fingers against her cheek, eliciting a soft sigh. 
&quot;No matter what. I will follow you everywhere and be it death itself.&quot;
	Venus nodded solemnly. &quot;So will I.&quot; She leaned forward to press 
her lips on mine and I lost myself in the beauty that was Sailorvenus, 
my companion, lover and mate, and now my only reason left to live

THE END(?)

******************************

Author&#39;s Note

Morbid much, yes?
There is really not much to say. I left a lot of things open for 
explanation. It would have become much too long otherwise. Basically, 
there IS some greater concept behind this but I doubt I&#39;ll ever get 
around to write it. So, for now, take this a one-shot.

Feedback as always welcome in whatever form as long as it is 
constructive.

Ja ne, yours
