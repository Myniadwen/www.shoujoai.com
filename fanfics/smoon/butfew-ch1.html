<h1>But for a Few Small Changes</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grandmoff.html">GrandMoff</a><br> </h2>
<pre>    -Haruka-  The first time I saw her, I thought she was adorable&#151;a 
beautiful, happy young girl.  She was taken of me as well.  Many young 
ladies are attracted to me when they first meet me.
    As I got to know her, I loved her more.  Her inner fire made her a 
fierce competitor; I admire that.  I had my Michiru, yet I confess 
that Usagi fascinated me and probably always will.
    Yes, I have Michiru&#133;and Usagi has Mamoru.  And we are all happy.  
But had it not been for Mamoru and Michiru, the sparks between us 
would have grown into flames of romantic delight.  We desired each 
other.  She would have been mine.
    -Minako-  When I met Usagi, it was almost like looking into a 
mirror.  Almost.  But a thrill raced through my body and I knew that 
she was going to be a part of my life forever.  I welcomed that 
knowledge.
    I&#146;m the senshi of love.  I don&#146;t just have it, I can feel it&#151;and 
in her?  It&#146;s like a shimmering river.  It&#146;s powerful, refreshing, and 
inspiring.  Her love would be a perfect match for mine.  So she is my 
twin in soul as well as in body.  I connect with her on the most basic 
level.   And if she had said the word, we could have been more than 
best friends.  We could have been&#133;one.  She would have been mine.
    -Makoto-  That first day we met, she thought she owed me for 
chasing away those bullies.  But we owed each other.  She was so kind 
to me, so warm.  She saw me not just for who I was, but who I could 
be.
    She was the first true friend I had since my parents died, but not 
the last, because she introduced me to all her friends and soon they 
became my friends too.  She is as genuine as you will find, and she 
wants everyone, even me, to be true to themselves.  Her sincerity and 
accepting attitude draw me to her.
    She has the heart of a martial artist&#151;her self-discipline and 
determination are truly magnificent.  If she ever wanted to learn, I 
would teach her and she would be a terrific student.  If I had the 
courage, I&#146;d ask her to teach me&#133;about patience&#133;about love&#133;
    She&#146;s the Moon Princess and her destiny lies along a different 
road.  But if it didn&#146;t, perhaps she&#146;d have been mine.
    -Rei-  She scared me from the moment I saw her.  I, who have all 
the restraint anyone could be expected to have, knew that she could 
crush my defenses at will.  I tried so hard to alienate and belittle 
her, but it didn&#146;t work.  She&#146;s too genki and too forgiving.
    Usagi&#146;s beauty runs so deep that I could lose myself in it, if she 
would let me.  I care for her so much that I would do anything she 
asked of me.  That&#146;s been said many times, but I really mean it.  I&#146;m 
at her command.
    I&#146;ve shared so much with her.  I give her my best.  I show her all 
I can do and I try to do more.  I have died for her without regret, as 
she has for me.  If devotion was as important as love, she would have 
been mine.
    -Ami-  She&#146;s my oldest and dearest friend, as much a prodigy in 
spirit as I am in mind.  I can&#146;t imagine life without her.  It would 
probably be glum and lonely, like a sky that would never again see the 
sun.  But with her, life is wonderful, incredible.  I haven&#146;t taught 
her a tenth of what she&#146;s taught me.
    I was Usagi&#146;s first teammate and I admit that I was jealous when 
Rei joined.  I had hoped that it would be the two of us, for at least 
a little while longer&#133;much as I love having so many other friends.
    I trust her more than anyone.  I won&#146;t ever leave her side, for 
anything.  If things could have stayed the way they were, she would 
have been mine.
    -Naru-  We were girls together.  As I grew up, I realized that one 
day, she would break my heart.  But I didn&#146;t mind.  Broken hearts 
heal, and she&#146;s easily worth a thousand of them.
    For a time, we were closer than sisters.  We laughed and cried 
together, we got in trouble, we learned about so many things&#133;
    I don&#146;t grudge her her friends, her adventures, her life, or her 
future.  Nothing lasts forever, I know that.  I&#146;m richer and better 
off for knowing her.  Anyone who&#146;s ever known her is.
    She&#146;ll never know that she&#146;s the love of my life, because I won&#146;t 
tell her and let her hurt herself with sadness for me.  I&#146;m not sad 
and she doesn&#146;t deserve to be either.  Even though we must drift 
apart, I&#146;ll stay in touch with her, come to her for advice, see her 
wedding, and visit her when I can.  I hope that when I die, I can be 
her angel.
    She&#146;s Sailor Moon.  But if she&#146;d been just plain Usagi-chan?  
She&#146;d have been mine, my love forever.

    -Author&#146;s note-  It&#146;s only anime and manga, but I really do feel 
bad, in a way, for all these girls.  Tsukino Usagi would be a good 
match for any of them.  Rei and Naru especially get my sympathy.
    But in another sense, Usagi teaches all of us, in the real world, 
quite a lot about the different forms of love.  And here&#146;s the best 
lesson I got from BSSM: the more love you give, the more you have.  
Arigatou, minna.</pre>
