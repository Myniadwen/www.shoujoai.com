<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/natsu.html">Meghan S. (aka Natsu)</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      It was another, typical day at Hikawa Shrine. Five girls sat 
around the low table in the center of the room, chit-chatting amongst 
themselves. Well, make that four girls were chit-chatting amongst 
themselves. Hino Rei did not chit-chat.

      &quot;Wow, that dress looks so cool! We should go shopping! I&#39;d love to 
get it!&quot; A bubbly blonde shook the magazine in her hand at her friends, 
grinning from ear to ear.

The brunette across from the table sighed, shaking her head.

      &quot;Usagi-chan, did you even take a look at the price on that thing? 
Besides, even if you could afford it, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little, 
well, flashy?&quot;

      Usagi pouted. &quot;Mou, Mako-chan, you don&#39;t have to be mean about 
it!&quot;

      &quot;She&#39;s right, Odango. I don&#39;t think Mamoru would want you wearing 
something like that in public.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re just saying that because you want it, Minako...&quot;

      Minako&#39;s eye twitched. She fixed their blue haired friend with a 
glare.

      &quot;Hush, Ami-chan.&quot;

      Ami sighed and went back to her laptop.

      &quot;Well, I think it&#39;s pretty. What about you, Rei-chan?&quot;

      Silence.

      &quot;...&quot;

      &quot;Oi, Rei-chan?&quot;

      The miko sat with her legs curled under, her nose stuck in the 
book she was currently reading, oblivious to the calling of her name.

      &quot;Moon to Rei-chan!&quot;

      A twitch.

      Amethyst eyes peered up and over the book, sending death glares in 
the way of their princess. Usagi gulped.

      &quot;What are you reading that&#39;s so much more important than us, 
Rei-ko.&quot; 

      Ah Minako. Ever the brave one... or was it stupid one?

      Rei visibly tensed, her fingers around the book tightening. &quot;I 
thought I told you not to call me that, Minako.&quot;

      The blonde grinned, pleased with herself for finally getting a 
rise out of the stoic miko. The others swallowed, awaiting their 
leader&#39;s impending doom.

      &quot;Did you? My apologies. But seriously, what are you reading?&quot;

      Hesitation.

      &quot;A book.&quot;

      Minako snorted. Rei glared.

      Makoto glanced from the blonde to the miko, then back again. 
Minako&#39;s shit-eating grin grew with each passing second. She was about 
to strike another nerve, Makoto could feel it.

      &quot;Ah, I think it&#39;s time I get going. Ami-chan, want me to walk you 
home?&quot; The brunette stood hastily, bringing the genius with her.

      &quot;Wh-what? But, we didn&#39;t even--&quot;

      &quot;Mako&#39;s right, it is getting late! I&#39;ll walk with you guys!&quot; Usagi 
jumped up.

      Makoto blinked. Did their princess sense it too? This...looming 
sense of dread?

      &quot;See you later, Rei-chan, Minako-chan!&quot; Usagi looped her arms with 
Makoto&#39;s and Ami&#39;s, nearly pulling them out the door. Makoto placed a 
hand on the wall, glancing back in at the two in their staring match. 
She opened her mouth, thought for a moment, then snapped it shut again 
and headed out after the other girls. Rei and Minako. Alone. Glaring at 
each other. They&#39;d be alright...right?

--

      &quot;I don&#39;t get it, Rei. Why are you always such a, a...&quot;

      &quot;A what, Mina?&quot;

      &quot;A bitch?!&quot;

      That did it. The book was slammed shut and tossed aside as the 
miko stood, forcing Minako back a step.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know reading in my own home made me a bitch.&quot; 
She growled.

      &quot;Well, no, but ignoring your best friends does! You always do 
this, Rei! We make plans to hang out, go shopping, whatever, and you 
always sit in the corner like some teenaged emo kid!&quot;

      Rei&#39;s eyes narrowed. She took another step forward.

      Minako stood her ground and waited. Waited for the yelling, the 
cursing, the possible burning down of the Shrine.

      But it never came.

      Rei&#39;s face scrunched up as she went over the blonde&#39;s words in her 
head. With a frown she plopped herself back down onto the bed, curling 
her legs up.

      Minako blinked, the adrenaline slowly fading as she watched Rei go 
from an animal ready to snap, to a kicked puppy.

      &quot;...you&#39;re right.&quot;

      Minako felt feint. Did...did Hino Rei just admit that she, Aino 
Minako, was right?

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry...what?&quot;

      The miko huffed, looking off to the side.

      &quot;I said you&#39;re right. I am a bitch.&quot;

      The blonde laughed, sitting next to her friend and second in 
command. Rei scowled.

      &quot;Look, Rei, I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re just so frustrating at times. Why 
won&#39;t you ever sit with us? You are part of the team, ya know.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s just it, Mina. We&#39;re not a team anymore. The only reason I 
stayed with them was because of our mission. I don&#39;t drool over every 
boy I see. I don&#39;t care about the latest gossip, or song, or anything 
like that. I&#39;m a soldier...was...a soldier. Now I just...I dunno.&quot; She 
Rei fell silent.

      &quot;And what about me?&quot;

      She looked up to find Minako staring down at her lap.

      &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

      &quot;You said you only stayed with them because of the mission. Is 
that why you stay around me, too?&quot;

      Rei flinched.

      &quot;No, Mina...I--&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s ok, Rei. I understand.&quot; She shook her head, blonde strands 
falling around her face. &quot;When I first met you guys, that&#39;s all I cared 
about: the mission. But as time went on...things changed. Yes, we were 
soldiers. Yes we had a duty to protect our princess...hell we still do. 
But that doesn&#39;t stop me from having fun.&quot;

      Minako turned to Rei then, smiling softly at the other girl. Ever 
so gently she cupped the miko&#39;s suddenly reddened cheek.

      &quot;That doesn&#39;t stop me from seeing you, Reiko.&quot;

      Rei swallowed, the blush spreading from her cheek to her ears. Not 
once since they met had Minako sounded so serious, so genuine. Rei was 
floored by it. For once, the fiery senshi was at a loss for words.

      Minako took this opportunity to lean closer to the speechless 
miko, tucking a few loose strands of raven hair behind an ear.

      &quot;Talk to me, Reiko. Please?&quot;

      Rei closed her eyes and inhaled the sweet scent of strawberries 
that was Minako. She shivered despite herself. Having the blonde so 
close, to feel her breath tickle her ear, was too much. She opened her 
eyes only to find Minako had closed the distance between them, their 
lips barely inches apart.

      &quot;Mina...ko. Don&#39;t...&quot;

      Mina smiled, taking Rei&#39;s burning cheeks in her hands. &quot;Don&#39;t 
what, my little Reiko?&quot; Her lips just grazed over the miko&#39;s trembling 
ones.

      &quot;Don&#39;t tease me like this...&quot;

      Minako giggled softly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She leaned those few inches 
closer, finally pressing her lips against Rei&#39;s.

      Rei inhaled sharply through her nose, a soft moan rumbling in her 
throat. Mina took that as an invitation and gently pushed the miko onto 
her back, their lips never parting.

      Minako slowly thread her fingers through Rei&#39;s midnight mane, 
gently kneading her scalp. A chill ran down the miko&#39;s spine and she 
tightened her grip on the blonde. Finally they parted for air, lips 
swollen and breathes laboured.

      They stared at one another for a long while, Rei gently running 
her fingers through Minako&#39;s hair while the latter stroked the others 
cheek. It was Rei who broke the silence first.

      &quot;Mina...what was that?&quot;

      &quot;I believe they call that a kiss, Reiko.&quot;

      The miko puffed her cheeks out and furrowed her brows.

      &quot;What did I tell you about calling me that?&quot;

      The blonde giggled and curled herself next to Rei.

      &quot;You love it and you know it.&quot;

      &quot;...whatever.&quot;

      Mina laughed, curling a finger around a black lock of hair. &quot;If it 
bothers you that much, I&#39;ll stop.&quot;

      &quot;...you don&#39;t...have to.&quot;

      &quot;Good. &#39;Cause I didn&#39;t plan on it.&quot;

Rei snorted. &quot;You&#39;re so stubborn.&quot;

      &quot;And you have a bad temper, what&#39;s your point?&quot;

      The two looked to each other again before breaking out into 
laughter. Soon Mina found herself wrapped in Rei&#39;s arms, her head tucked 
under the miko&#39;s chin.

      &quot;Ne, Rei-chan?&quot;

      &quot;Hm?&quot;

      &quot;I love you.&quot;

      Rei&#39;s heart skipped a beat and she looked down to Minako.

      &quot;What?&quot;

      &quot;I said... I love you.&quot; A light blush coloured the idol&#39;s cheeks 
as she smiled up at Rei. Rei&#39;s own blush came back full force.

      &quot;I...I love you too, Mina.&quot; She gave the blonde a squeeze, kissing 
the top of her head. Minako shifted, suddenly straddling the miko with a 
wolfish grin. Rei gulped.

      &quot;M-Mina?&quot;

      &quot;So, I was thinking, wanna pick up where we left off earlier?&quot;

      Rei&#39;s cheeks burned hotter than her own fire ever could.
