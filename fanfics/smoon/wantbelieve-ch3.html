<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Sign<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  could have been just another ordinary, dark-haired young woman standing  outside just another ordinary restaurant on the Juuban strip, waiting  for just another ordinary friend that was current running behind  schedule.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hino Rei was far from ordinary, in all those respects but one. Tsukino Usagi, though also equally as unordinary as she, <em>was</em> very, very late.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  scowled. She knew she should be happy to be home, to get the rare  opportunity to see her old friends, especially to have a night out on  the town with her Princess. But instead, Rei was anxious, for although  she was looking forward to seeing her friends, the reason for her  return to Tokyo wasn’t a social call at all, it was shrine business.  Shrine business that would result in a decision she would have to make  that she was still coming to terms with.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Perhaps the future isn’t so cut and dry after all.’</em> She pondered darkly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko shook herself mentally. It would be no good to greet Usagi in such  a pensive mood. Perhaps it was a good thing she was late. To lighten  her spirits, she created a diversion by immersing herself in the  scenery, eyeing over her old haunts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A glance to the left, past  the parking lot flow of traffic and beyond the nearly solid wall of  pedestrians across the street was a garish neon sign written in  katakana text that read; ‘Crown’. For Rei and her friends, the  karaoke-ya had been both a home away from home and a secret base for  their senshi gatherings. The place also made her think of her Princess,  where she had refused her insistent friend each and every time she was  asked to join in a round of karaoke. Above the Crown building, rotating  blue and white lights caught her eye, and Rei recognized the Ferris  wheel of the amusement park that Ami had been so fond of, the amusement  park that had also doubled as a battleground in their fight against the  Dark Kingdom on several occasions. Next to capture her eye was the  brick façade of the Imperial Hotel. Frequently a site for uncomfortable  meetings between herself and her politician father, it was also where  she and Makoto had gotten to know one another, and had run up and down  its halls with wild abandon in their escape.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A look to the north  granted her a view of a Catholic church, and suddenly Rei’s reminiscent  mood was tinged with warring emotions. There was a hint of sadness  there, for the graveyard behind the chapel was the final resting place  of her mother, but there was also something else that lurked in Rei’s  heart when she saw that small, stone building. It was where she’d first  seen Aino Minako, in which the moment they met had touched off both  their friendship and their first rivalry. It was also where she’d met  Sailor Venus, where Rei had found that the safety of she who’d she’d  first thought was her Princess had sparked a helpless, yet well hidden,  obsession deep within her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A sudden car horn tore Rei from her  growingly introspective world. Jumping slightly, her small, black purse  slipped from the crook of her arm and fell to the ground at her feet.  Stooping quickly to collect it, she gathered a couple items that had  threatened to slip out; her Teletia S, a small compact, and lastly, a  strip of photo club pictures she couldn’t help but pull out slightly to  get a better look at.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She slowly stood back up against the wall  of the restaurant, and the crowds of people passing by her, the slow,  steady flow of traffic, and the constant assault on the senses that was  the sights and sounds of Tokyo faded just slightly as she looked at the  memento of she and Minako. A long strip featuring several shots of the  two of them, the progression of the images almost told the story of  their friendship. The first photo showed Rei on the far side of the  photo, obviously irritated at the thought of being in a photo booth,  and Minako, a wide smile on her face, sitting just off the photo’s  center. The shot in the middle showed marked improvement, with Rei  having inched more into the photo, a tentative smile pulling at her  lips and Minako stealing a glance at her out of the corner of her eye.  The last shot was Rei’s favorite. Flashing the victory sign with one  hand, Minako had her other arm around Rei’s shoulder, her head tipped  into Rei’s, and Rei, having finally gotten comfortable with the idea,  was Minako’s mirror image.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just like that sequence of photos,  Rei’s friendship and rivalry with Minako had evolved into something  more than simple idolism and competition, and had reached its peak with  Minako’s illness related death and the subsequent rebirth of the world  at Usagi’s hands. They were feelings that had reemerged the very day  they’d all met again and regained their memories of the incredible feat  they’d accomplished as senshi, and those feelings for Minako had  continued to grow even as they’d begun to go their separate ways; with  Rei pursuing her Shinto calling and Minako touring overseas. Yet, even  apart, their friendship budded on late night phone calls, had grown on  the occasional letter and photo swap, and had blossomed on rare face to  face visits they’d shared over the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In fact, this  very photo had been taken the last time Minako had been in town. It had  been so brief that the other girls hadn’t even known the international  idol had been in town and she’d only had the time to see Rei. It had  been just the two of them and Rei had enjoyed having her closest  friend, her best friend, all to herself for a change…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A fierce  blush colored Rei’s cheeks. Flustered, she averted her eyes and shoved  the photo strip back in her purse, and though she wasn’t entirely sure  that the shiver that traveled down her spine was borne from the bitter  gusts of pre-winter wind that howled between Tokyo’s walls of  buildings, she huddled into her black wool jacket none the less. Just  when it seemed that nothing could possibly warm her, a gasp issued  through her chattering teeth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A bitter gust of wind shook the  wooden frame that held the leather and wool tent in place, causing a  drift of snow to roll off the pitched roof.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  inhospitable weather outside created a sharp contrast to the inside of  the tent, where a fire crackled and popped in its center. The flames  danced wildly, the embers reaching for the darkness as the fireglow  teased the dancing shadows of the small space. Bathed in the red and  orange hues of the fire, the cold, leather skin of a thick blanket gave  way to warm fur underneath, but it wasn’t the only thing heating the  two bare bodies beneath its protection.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Despite her fiery  nature and regardless of the flames that fueled her powers, Mars’  homeworld was a cold and bitter planet. As such, the fire senshi was at  home even in the coldest of terrains, even if her partner wasn’t. But  one thing Venus was quick to learn was that the Martians have a talent  for heating up even the coldest of beds. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Caramel eyes, watched passionately by a set of darker ones, slowly shut before a raspy whisper filled the cold air hotly. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Rei-” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  a sharp intake of breath, Rei shuddered again, only, this time, she  wasn’t quite as cold as she had been. She frowned warily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had happened again. Another memory of her past life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  chewed her lower lip idly. She’d had several seemingly random visions  ever since that night just days ago in the fireroom, when she’d tapped  into a memory from her past life that she wasn’t meant to remember, a  hauntingly vague vision of a battlefield, of Venus… a wounded Venus,  and the fierce eyes of Sailor Mars that seemed to guard any further  details. It was all she could remember, and it bothered her greatly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  did it bother her as greatly as the new visions she’d had since? A  blush colored her cheeks. She and Minako hadn’t exactly been on a <em>battlefield</em> in that last one. It’s not that the thought disgusted her. Quite the  contrary, in fact. One couldn’t exactly attend a Catholic girls’ school  without examining the concept of girl-girl relationships, and for Rei,  this included the crazy thought of sharing such a relationship with her  closest friend…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes. She could admit to herself that she’d been  attracted to Minako ever since they’d met. It was a fact she’d kept to  herself in the five years of their friendship, too afraid to voice her  feelings, afraid of ridicule, afraid of driving her closest friend  away… and now she was learning that the Venus and Mars of the past may  have shared such a relationship? It wasn’t the only vision she’d had  that suggested such a relationship, either. The irony was almost too  much for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In fact, although she couldn’t tap back into that  one particular memory of herself and the wounded Venus on the  battlefield, she <em>had</em> tapped into a wealth of others. For  example, although she was learning that the Mars and Venus of the past  had shared some kind of physical relationship, it hadn’t always been  smooth sailing between the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Long plumes of grasses  billowed in the wind, stirred by the smoke left from the remnants of a  mock battle. The other girls had retreated inside to celebrate a  victory that hadn’t come easily, but Venus took the opportunity to  roughly corner her subordinate against the flagstone wall of their  makeshift headquarters. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Mars, do you hate me?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes!”  The senshi of fire’s white gloved hands clenched into tightly balled  fists at her sides, but she was unable to maintain eye contact with her  superior. They were standing close. Too close for Mars’ comfort. Too  close for her to breathe.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><br />
  The Venusian Princess recoiled at the normally evasive and stubborn  girl’s honest answer. After three months of training alongside the  introverted Martian, it was the most direct answer she’d ever received,  and although she may have struck a nerve, her brief answer wasn’t good  enough. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Why  do you hate me?” The question was meant to come off as indignant, but  even to Venus’ own ears, her voice sounded hurt. She made a show of  casually tossing her golden hair over a shoulder, hoping her self  proclaimed rival hadn’t detected her weakness. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><br />
  Too tense to have noticed, Mars plunged forward, her arms pressed  tightly against her chest, her voice an accusatory bark. “I resent the  fact that you just waltzed in here and claimed yourself as our leader.”<br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That was predetermined. You know I was sent to train alongside the outer senshi for that purpose.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><br />
  Waist length raven hair swaying softly in the gentle breeze, Mars’  windswept bangs betrayed watery eyes. When her rival acknowledged her  tears by relaxing her posture and widening those caramel eyes, she  snapped at Venus’ expression of concern. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I  don’t care about someone else’s plan for the future, and I don’t  appreciate the fact that you just walked into my life and turned it  upside down!” The Martian gasped, choking on her own breath. How could  she have slipped up like that? She’d revealed such a weakness to her  rival in both words and gestures. She’d given herself away when she’d  meant to distance herself from this woman who confused her so terribly. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><br />
  “Mars?” The golden haired woman’s voice was a shaky whisper. Was she  reading the fire senshi right or was she just imagining what she knew  she wanted to see as she read between the lines? In the confusion, in  her concern, Venus’ senshi persona faded away in a golden glow. With an  equally shaky hand, Minako reached out to her subordinate. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Watching  the suddenly dark haired girl reach out for her with a shaky hand that  seemed so warm, so comforting, Mars flinched, pressing herself against  the cold stone wall. Eyes wide, she looked like a caged animal. Her  fear was tangible, and she knew Minako could feel it, for the slightly  smaller girl paused slightly, giving Mars just the space she needed to  slip away from her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Why do you care what I think, anyway?” Mars spat before sprinting away.<br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes. Not unlike their present day relationship, it had  seemed as though the one of their past had been just as muddled with  rivalry, competition, confusion and uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that led Rei  back to her original question. Why remember her past life now, five  years after awakening as a senshi? Indeed, it was as though by having  triggered that first seemingly forbidden memory, the floodgates to her  past life’s memories had opened, and random events of that era now  deemed to pop into her mind unbidden. Certainly none of the snippets  that were coming back to her could have helped her in any way, shape,  or form during their struggle against the Dark Kingdom on the  battlefield of <em>war</em>… Rei blushed hotly at the implication. Just what was going on here? Just what did she need these memories for? And why <em>now</em> of all times, did she have to deal with these strange memories that  served only to fan the flames of her confused and jumbled feelings for  Minako?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-chan! Rei-chan! Rei-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If Rei had been  paying the least amount of attention to her surroundings, she wouldn’t  have been quite so shocked with what had happened next.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reiiiii!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”  Barely remembering where she was, the miko blinked right before she was  almost tackled to the ground by an unknown body. Gathering her wits,  her balance and her bearings, she managed to right herself and her  assailant, saving them both from an impact with the restaurant wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan!?” Rei was caught between frowning and smiling at her exuberant Princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Heh  heh.” The dark haired, pigtailed girl righted herself and flashed her  friend the victory sign. “Sorry I’m so late, Rei-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a  wide smile on her face, Usagi polished off the remains of a double  banana split, a stark contrast to her friend, who pushed a few  blueberries around the crust of a half eaten tart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Although she’d  tried her hardest to keep up with Usagi’s somehow impossibly  complicated life of housewife and part time book store clerk, which  consisted of a confusing jumble of names, places, and events, Rei was  still two steps behind her Princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, your boss, Haruna-san-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no, Haruna-chan is my coworker. Mizuki-san is my boss.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh… right.” Rei’s brow furrowed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi’s  expression softened. Her most introspective and subsequently least  socially adept senshi wasn’t one for gossiping purposes and so she  shifted the direction of conversation. “Ne, Rei-chan, I’m really glad  you’re back for a visit, but you haven’t told me, what actually brings  you back to Tokyo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s lips pinched together. She took a deep  breath and slowly set her fork onto her plate quietly. Her hands folded  in her lap awkwardly. “I, um… I was asked to become Priestess of the  Kyoto-yama Shrine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A forgotten ice cream spoon clattered against Usagi’s empty bowl nosily. “Really!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  cheeks colored immediately. She couldn’t find the courage to look  either her friend or the other diners in the eye, as Usagi’s high  pitched squeal seemed to have made the quiet restaurant even quieter,  drawing the attention of several couples to their table.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though  her voice returned to a normal decibel, Usagi’s exuberance didn’t  diminish in the least. “Oh, Rei-chan, I’m so happy for you! You must be  so excited! You’ve worked towards this your whole life!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah…  un.” Rei nodded slightly. “Well, I still have to… seek approval from  the priest of my former temple here in Tokyo first… but you see, I-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi’s  hands clasped before her and she sighed dramatically. “Oh Rei-chan,  you’ll be so perfect as a Priestess. And to imagine how much you’ve  changed since we first met.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei frowned cautiously as her Princess steamrolled right over her. “Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh come on, you’re being too modest! And to think, one of <em>my</em> closest friends will be a real Priestess!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei faltered momentarily. Usagi may have misread her hesitation as modesty, but she had also made a very true statement. She <em>had</em> changed greatly in those five years since meeting her Princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Five  years ago, Tsukino Usagi had become friends with a bitter, standoffish  girl, and through her unintentional lessons of friendship, and trust,  she had affected Rei greatly. It was Kino Makoto who had taught the  angry miko to release her hatred for her father and as a result, Rei  began the healing process of trying to understand the estranged man.  Mizuno Ami had taught her not only dedication to a cause, but relief in  saving a friend and cherishing that friendship.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then, there  was Aino Minako. Minako had taught Rei rivalry. She had toughened her  up, forced her to look inside herself to find her own power. Minako had  taught her respect and perhaps true friendship, a friendship that,  despite their differences and ongoing rivalries, was deeper than  anything Rei had ever felt in her life. And in turn, <em>she</em> had  taught Minako a thing or two as well, hadn’t she? Not that the idol had  ever said it in so many words, but Rei knew she was responsible for  showing their wayward leader that there was more to life than duty,  that she had helped to give Minako a reason to live once again…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And she was getting carried away again, wasn’t she? Rei kept a frustrated sigh at bay. It always came back to Minako, didn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was only then that she’d realized that Usagi had never stopped talking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is so great! We’ll have to celebrate this occasion! And since you’re  actually in town, almost all of us can get together now that Ami  started her residence last month.” A frown quickly captured Usagi’s  lips as she pondered the brooding miko. “You don’t look too excited  about all this, Rei-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s dark eyes widened. How could she  explain her uncharacteristic worries about her future to her Princess?  Not wanting to be a downer when Usagi was so excited, she plastered a  slight smile on her face. “Oh, no, I’m sure you’ll plan a great party,  Usagi. It’s just… until I talk to my elders here at Hikawa Shrine, I  don’t want everyone to know yet. That’s all. Do you think… you can keep  it a secret until then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi hummed, nodding sagely and winking  at her friend. “You can count on me!” She smiled when Rei visibly  relaxed. “But we have to have a party anyway.” She flashed the victory  sign at her suddenly grumpy friend, to which Rei couldn’t help but  giggle. Usagi was a difficult one to stay angry at, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  an overly dramatic sigh, the pigtailed girl propped her elbows on the  table and rested her chin on her palms. “Too bad Minako wasn’t here  though, or we’d all be together again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Almost as if on cue, the  dark haired woman across the table from her squinted, her gaze  seemingly stuck on the flame of the small candle that sat between them.  Rei breathed in sharply, her breath hitching in her throat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?”  Usagi asked tentatively, concern mounting for her suddenly entranced  friend, noting the concentration that furrowed the miko’s brow and the  wistful, almost lost look that captured her expression. “Rei-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still  not achieving a response, she began to fear for her former senshi.  Cautiously reaching out to try to shake her friend, she’d almost made  contact with the chilled gooseflesh of Rei’s bare arms when the miko  finally spoke in a hushed whisper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What about tomorrow, Rei-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s coming back tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi  almost jumped backwards at Rei’s deadpan voice, but the hairs on the  back of her neck stood on end regardless. Although she didn’t possess  the deductive abilities of most, Usagi knew that Rei was captured by  the flame. “Who’s coming back, Rei-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Trying to see what her  powerful friend was sensing in the fire that fueled her mystical  powers, Usagi peered into the small, flickering flame. Somehow, if she  squinted just right, she thought she could almost make out the image of  Aino Minako…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The flame extinguished itself in a non-existent breeze. The miko at the other end of the table shuddered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry, did you say something, Usagi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello?”  Usagi asked lazily where she lay with her feet at the head of her bed.  At the other end, where she twirled a finger around a lock of hair  absently, her head rested next to a dark blue plushie of a sleeping cat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan, it’s-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Minako-chan!” </em>Usagi squealed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  a screaming meow, the now very awake plushie bolted from the bed in  surprise, landing on the low table below that served as Mamoru’s desk,  sending his textbooks crashing to the floor. Minako chuckled as Usagi  dropped the phone to perform damage control, apologizing to Luna before  helping her husband gather his textbooks off the floor. It was only a  brief moment before her Princess picked up the phone again, this time,  using a much more normal tone of voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, Minako-chan, sorry  about that. It’s so good to hear from you! How are you? How is your  tour going? Are you still in Britain?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Trying to keep up with her  friend’s rapid fire questioning, the idol propped her feet up on the  coffee table and made mental notes in order to answer them all. Artemis  hopped up on her lap and she idly stroked the soft fur of the white  plushie.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I <em>am</em> in Britain right now, but you see, my manager is planning a huge encore finale concert in Tokyo, and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What!?</em> An encore finale? Here in Tokyo!?” The phone was muffled again as Usagi  apologized for startling her cat and her husband for a second time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un, next week. So I’ll be flying back home tomorrow-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! Rei-chan was right!” Usagi exclaimed, though she was more eager to learn the details of the event.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“R-Rei?” The name was a distracted whisper on the idol’s lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un.  Well, not in so many details, of course. She just told me you were  coming back tomorrow. She didn’t know about the concert, or-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But how would she…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  I guess the fire told her. She was looking at you in the flame of a  candle. But don’t tell her I said that! I’ll bet she’d get real upset  with me for some silly reason.” Usagi said with mock exasperation.  “Anyway, we have to get everyone together for a huge celebration! The  first one will be for your return and then we’re going to have another  party, because Rei has something to celebrate too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something to celebrate?” Through her numbed state of shock, it was the only part of Usagi’s dialogue Minako managed to capture.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! It’s a secret! You’ll just have to wait to find out.” Usagi stated smugly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“U-un.” Minako agreed dumbly, her mind solely devoted to a much more shocking event.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  rest of their conversation was a blur to the idol. Perhaps a little too  adept at flying on auto pilot, she was vaguely aware of divulging all  the information about the still top-secret concert to her number one  fan, and the next thing she knew she was hanging up the phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t know how long she sat there numbly, clutching her cell phone in  her right hand, her left still stroking the sleeping Artemis slowly,  but eventually, staring forward aimlessly at nothing began to burn her  eyes, and with a long sigh, she leant her head back into the chair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  knew little about Rei’s psychic abilities, but she did know that it was  a feat to receive a premonition in a medium as weak as a candle. And to  see not only a premonition, but to have understood in such detail that  she was coming back the next day…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako shut her eyes slowly.  Mars Reiko had been known to have that ability. So was Rei tapping into  the abilities of her previous persona? Could she have sensed danger,  and was searching for her leader?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mars Reiko…” Minako gasped  breathlessly. Could she even begin to hope that maybe, just maybe, the  Mars Reiko buried within Rei had begun to stir? For if Rei could locate  Minako via a weak flame of a candle, had other abilities, other <em>memories</em> had resurfaced in her as well?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  had told herself, time and again, that she wouldn’t pursue Rei  romantically. Not unless there was a sign, a sign that Rei might  remember the past life they’d shared, a sign that Rei might return her  feelings…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But could Minako dare to believe that such a sign had  just showed itself, or was she just getting her hopes up falsely? Was  she setting herself up to be disappointed?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does it matter?” She whispered to Britain’s skyline. “There’s no turning back now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s Notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  promise, in the next chapter, Rei and Minako will finally meet again!  Actually, I really like this chapter, even though our main characters  still have yet to meet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 4:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  felt a shiver travel down her spine. She was so badly shaken that she  didn’t know whether she wanted to push Minako away or pull her towards  her, to smack that all knowing smirk off her beautiful face, or to kiss  those utterly tempting lips. All she knew for certain was that she  couldn’t stand Minako’s silent gaze any longer. So Rei expressed her  emotions the only way she knew how.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You got a staring problem?” She challenged her former leader.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t… can’t you stare elsewhere then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe I already like what I see.”</span></p>
