<h1>Come into My Chamber (part 2 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;You need to feed, dearest...&quot;

&quot;No! I shall not! Why wouldst I desire to be a scourge of the Undead 
ranks such as you?!&quot;

&quot;Please...the blood of humans...you need it...

&quot;No...no...please...so tired..&quot;

&quot;..Just take him...deliver him...&quot;
 
And gently, slowly, the life was taken from the man...he was delivered 
from the pain and suffering of life...

But the girl wondered...
 
Would she be delivered from this eternal death?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Libera me, Domine, de morte aeterna...

Deliver me, O Lord, from eternal death...
 
 
&quot;Do you have any leads, Detective?&quot; Rei sighed. How long ago was it that 
she had slept?  &quot;No,&quot; she growled, &quot;I DO not have any leads.&quot; She stared 
at the officer until he started to squirm. &quot;Get me some coffee...please? I 
have to go to the morgue today.&quot; The officer nodded, and to Rei&#146;s 
amusement, he saluted her. &quot;Oh God,&quot; Rei muttered, &quot;We really need to 
find this crazy bastard...&quot;
 
===================
 
In all her years as a doctor, Mizuno Ami had NEVER seen anything like 
this. &quot;It&#146;s fascinating...&quot; she murmured to the detective at her side. 
&quot;What&#146;s fascinating?&quot; Rei growled, not in the mood for dealing with dead 
bodies. Ami turned to her, shaking her head. &quot;The blood...is all 
gone...seems to me you have a modern day vampire. No fingerprints, no 
identification, just these tiny little marks..&quot; she turned the victim so 
that the neck was exposed, and Rei cursed. &quot;Dammit...so..Doctor...if you 
find any leads, tell me, ok?&quot; Ami smiled. &quot;Of course...I&#146;ll be working on 
this all night.&quot; Rei shuddered. &quot;Doctor, I don&#146;t know HOW you do it...&quot; 
Ami chuckled. &quot;Well Detective Hino, that&#146;s what us forensic pathologists 
do..&quot;
 
===================
 
All this talk of vampires was NOT good for Makoto Kino. Her business was 
failing because of it! Who wanted to go out at night, when there were 
loony vampire serial killers around? But Makoto had been brave since the 
day she was born. Nothing would stop her from working...not even vampires. 
She heard the chime as the door to her restaurant open, and immediately 
perked up. &quot;Hello, and how may I...&quot; she trailed off when she saw the two 
women.
 
Utterly beautiful, horrific, frightening, gorgeous...all at once. 
Alabaster skin, eyes too...far too luminous to be human...
 
For the first time in a long time, Makoto was frightened.
 
&quot;What...what do you want?&quot;
 
A smooth voice spoke, too deep for a woman, too light for a man.  &quot;I 
am...Haruka...&quot; the thing...no woman motioned to the smaller young lady at her 
side, &quot;and this is Michiru. Our lady has requested you join her ranks.&quot; 
Makoto&#146;s eyes darkened. &quot;Ranks?&quot; Michiru smiled widely, the light making 
her fangs seem impossibly bright. &quot;Oh yes..&quot; she purred, &quot;You have been 
chosen. You should rejoice.&quot;
 
Makoto ran. She tore out the back door of the restaurant, and did not 
look back. However, Haruka and Michiru were too fast, and before she 
knew it, she felt the skin of her neck being broken by Michiru&#146;s fangs.
 
Before she lost consciousness, she heard Haruka say to Michiru,
 
&quot;You know darling, seeing you all...feral like this is quite a turn-on...&quot;
 
===================
 
Minako was bored. Night prowling was beginning to lose its glamour. She 
yawned, and hopped onto another roof, stretching and baring her fangs. 
&quot;Gods...I&#146;m so bored...&quot; She stared down on the near-empty streets of Tokyo, 
biting down a soft laugh. &quot;They&#146;re all scared of big bad &quot;serial 
killer.&quot; She looked down again, and smiled. &quot;Or maybe not...&quot; she 
murmured, seeing a young lady hurriedly walking home..

===================
 
Mitsuki was never one to ignore frightening creatures like vampires. In 
all honesty, she was quite superstitious. But unfortunately, her slave 
driver of a employer, Kazuki, had kept her in late. Mitsuki often 
wondered how someone as pretty as Kazuki could be so evil. &quot;Whatever...&quot; 
she murmured, feeling a chill run by her. She picked up her pace. She 
did not detect the rustling of Minako&#146;s cape, or the movement in the 
shadows...
 
===================

Minako watched her and smiled. &quot;Pretty...&quot; she whispered, taking note of 
the woman&#146;s long mane of white hair, her sharp emerald eyes, the way 
those blue jeans hugged her curves...she smirked. &quot;Oh bad Minako...all 
those thoughts...the poor girl is probably still as innocent as the day 
she was born...&quot; Minako decided she&#146;d see the girl home. No harm in that. 
Only, Minako thought, walking through the shadows, she&#146;d be very 
frightened if she saw me...I&#146;ll just keep an eye on her from afar...hmm...I 
wonder what type of vampire she&#146;d make....nope...Milady said I couldn&#146;t take 
any more into the clan after the last three...but she IS pretty. Wonder if 
she has a boyfriend? I COULD just...hmm...seduce her, and drink from her 
later...but what a waste of beauty...awfully tempting though...her trail of 
thought headed far beyond the realm of decency as she caught the sway of 
Mitsuki&#146;s hips...she simply decided she&#146;d watch.
 
For the time being...
 
===================

Mitsuki sighed in relief as she made it to her front door. &quot;No vampires 
or anything!&quot; She could have sworn she heard someone laugh, and she 
looked around warily. &quot;Umm...&quot; she fumbled for her keys, and made it 
safely inside her apartment, sighing in relief. &quot;Man...&quot; she whispered 
softly, &quot;home at last...&quot; She walked toward her bathroom. &quot;I&#146;m so 
tired...taking a shower and going to bed...&quot;

===================

Minako cursed as the door slammed in front of her. &quot;Man,&quot; she whined, 
&quot;how am I gonna get in now...oh! Mist trick..yes...&quot; She closed her eyes, 
and soon dissipated into mist, going through the keyhole. She stared 
around the apartment and smiled. &quot;Nice...&quot; she walked over to a small 
nightstand and stared at the pictures the girl had framed and set on it. 
&quot;Hmm...&quot; she murmured, staring at the photos. One was the young lady with 
an older woman that looked like her, with the exception of her eyes 
being blue-gray instead of emerald...another of the girl with two other 
young women, a short young lady with red hair and bright azure eyes, and 
one with wavy long blue-green hair and skin a few shades lighter than 
mahogany...the third picture was of the young lady being hugged by a young 
man with white-blond hair and glasses, with the girls from the previous 
picture in the background, arguing it seemed...Minako smiled. Three other 
young men were in the picture as well...a serious looking man with ice 
blue hair and skin about the same shade as the aqua haired girl...and two 
cheerful-looking men, one with a tan, and bright blue eyes, the other 
with brown hair and solemn eyes...Minako took a look at the last picture, 
which was of the girl with another woman who did not seemed 
pleased...this woman had pale skin and beautiful raven-black hair and 
jade eyes...she looked familiar to Minako, but she shook off the thought 
as she heard the sound of running water... &quot;Hmm...&quot; she whispered, walking 
over to the closed door..

===================

Mitsuki sighed as she stepped into the shower. She grabbed a bottle of 
shampoo and set to work on her hair...and then she paused...something wasn&#146;t 
right. She pulled back the shower curtain and looked around warily...
 
Nothing. Just steam.
 
She sighed weakly, cursing her paranoia, and stepped back into the 
shower to finish her hair...
 
===================

Minako was not usually a peeping tom...but the sight of that woman...water 
dripping down her nude body...beautiful...made her wish she had thought of 
an idea like this before...she would stay a bit longer. Eternally grateful 
to whoever gave vampires the ability to turn into mist, she hid among 
the steam, waiting for the girl to finish her shower..
 
===================

Mitsuki yawned and slipped into her pajamas, climbing into bed. She took 
a look at the pictures on her nightstand and frowned. They look 
different...Mitsuki! Calm down...she shook the thoughts out of her head and 
fell asleep almost as soon as her head hit the pillow...
 
===================
 
It would be now...Minako walked over to the bed and knelt down by the 
girl, gently brushing her hair away from her beautiful neck...she strummed 
her fingers along the pulse gently, causing the girl to involuntarily 
move in her sleep.
 
So close...the vampire thought, taking a moment to stare at the sleeping 
woman, then kneeling down, gently planting butterfly kisses on her face, 
along her jawline...her neck...she reached the pulse...bared her fangs to 
tear through the woman&#146;s skin, yearning for the taste of her sweet, 
sweet blood...yearning for her...her essence...
 
She pulled away.
 
She sighed. &quot;It&#146;d be a waste,&quot; she whispered, moving to kiss the girl&#146;s 
forehead. She knelt down close , and whispered in the girl&#146;s ear...
 
&quot;Goodnight, and sweet dreams, Tenshi...&quot;

She turned into mist again, and left the way she came...
 
====================
 
Mitsuki shot up and gasped, looking around. Someone was in here...I KNOW 
it...
 
Whatever the case, she was most certainly not going to sleep now..
 
====================
 
&quot;Milady...um...&quot; the teenager handed the woman a newspaper, and bowed 
politely. The woman took the newspaper, and frowned immediately. &quot;Thank 
you Hotaru...you may go and join the hunt now.&quot; Hotaru shook her head 
vehemently. &quot;No Milady...I&#146;ll stay here with you.&quot; The woman smiled, 
patting the girl on the head gently, and took a look at the main story 
in the paper, skimming through it idly until she saw a picture that 
caught her eye. The picture was grainy, but even still one could see the 
woman in the photo was beautiful, long dark hair...exotic features.. 
&quot;Hmm...&quot; the woman said, smiling down at Hotaru, &quot;Detective Rei Hino...is 
very pretty, ne?&quot; Hotaru nodded. &quot;Yes Milady...would you like us to 
retrieve her?&quot; The woman smiled, and felt something rise in her that she 
had buried long ago. This woman...she sensed this one would be dangerous...
 
&quot;No Hotaru. I wish to hunt this one...alone...I think that Lady Serenity 
will once again join the fray, if only to keep this silly detective from 
harming my kind.&quot;
 
Hotaru laughed, her violet eyes lighting up in happiness. &quot;Oh Milady, 
what a joyous occasion!&quot;
 
Serenity smiled sadly. &quot;Yes...I suppose it is...&quot;
