<a href="../smoon/leftbehind-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Chapter Three - The Compromise

&quot;Illusion never changed
Into something real
I&#39;m wide awake
And I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You&#39;re a little late
I&#39;m already torn.&quot;
-Natalie Imbruglia, &quot;Torn&quot;

Around this point I wasn&#39;t sure if I was awake or still dreaming.  I&#39;d
just been so used to the way things were, the idea that they weren&#39;t
that way anymore just seemed to unreal to believe.  But then I started
thinking...maybe I wasn&#39;t dreaming now.  Maybe I&#39;d been dreaming before.
Maybe everything, my whole life, had been a dream, and now I was seeing
things awake for the first time.

-----

It was a compromise.

Michiru&#39;s father was an old-fashioned man from an old-fashioned home.
Her mother was a modern woman, already living in the future.  They had
naturally disagreed on the funeral proceedings.  After a while, they
finally reached a compromise between Shinto and Western practice.

It had been two weeks since Michiru&#39;s death, and it had taken that long
just to get her family to stop sobbing uncontrollably every time the
Senshi talked to them.  Setsuna had been stuck with the unenviable job
of delivering the bad news, since Haruka had vanished.  None of them had
seen her once in the past two weeks.

They had told the Kaioh family the truth...or as much of it as they
could safely tell.  Michiru&#39;s heart crystal had been stolen during a
fight between the Sailor Senshi and Witches 5, they said.  She was dead
before there was anything they could have done.

Of the rest of the Senshi, Michiru&#39;s parents knew only Haruka and
Setsuna.  They knew the three of them lived together, and that she and
Haruka had been lovers (the idea, somewhat strangely, had been less
appealing to Michiru&#39;s mother than her father).  But that they were
Sailor Senshi, or that they had been in a power struggle with the Inner
Senshi...that, they had not known.  And no one was keen on telling them,
either.

There were two other sisters in the Kaioh family, one older than Michiru
and one younger.  The older sister had the same sea-green hair color,
while the younger, like her parents, had dark brown or black hair.  All
of them were meeting the Inners for the first time, here, at Michiru&#39;s
funeral.

The funeral was being held at Hikawa Shrine.  The services were offered
free of charge, since the deceased was an acquaintance of the temple
maiden.

-----

&quot;And now, in accordance with the family&#39;s wishes, we will commence the
eulogy,&quot; said Rei, standing at the head of the shrine, facing the crowd.
She pushed the stop button on her stereo, which had been playing a
recording of one of Michiru&#39;s concerts (provided by Setsuna).

Rei, Grandpa and Yuuichiro were dressed in their traditional Shinto
robes.  They were the only ones not wearing black.

Michiru&#39;s father walked to where Rei stood.  He cleared his throat and
tried to speak, but only made a high-pitched squawk.  He rubbed his eyes
and tried again.  This time they could hear him.

&quot;I would like to speak on behalf of my family,&quot; he murmured.  He coughed
again and spoke louder.  &quot;My wife and I come from very different homes,
with very different upbringing.  We have our own particular strengths,
and our own particular weaknesses.  Before our children were born, it
was both of our wishes that they would inherit the best of both of us,
and none of the worst.  For sixteen years, I have been proud to say that
Michiru granted our wish more than we ever could have hoped.&quot;

He gestured to the walls of the shrine, which had been adorned with many
of Michiru&#39;s paintings, and to a box his youngest daughter held, which
contained Michiru&#39;s violin.

&quot;We were overjoyed that she had taken to my hobby of painting, and
shared her mother&#39;s affinity for music.  And like both of us, she loved
the sea.  We were proud she was able to attend an exclusive school like
Mugen Gakuen.  And while I&#39;m happy to say that we never took these
things for granted, we never imagined that someday they would be all we
had left of her.

&quot;There is an old saying I once heard: &#39;The greatest tragedy is when a
parent outlives his child.&#39;  And while I never doubted the truth to this
saying, I never imagined I would someday be living it.

&quot;I know that a lot of people who lose a child dwell on what that child
could have been, could have done with their life.  In my heart, I have
no doubt that Michiru could someday have been the best in the world at
anything and everything she really loved, I just can&#39;t dwell on that.  I
loved her too much-and I still do-to dismiss the things she *did* do in
her short time here.  In just sixteen years, Michiru lived longer, lived
greater, and lived happier than some who live to be a hundred.  Not just
in her art, her music, her schoolwork, or any of what we have left of
her, but in all that she takes with her to the next life.  In all that
she was, there are no words to express the pride and the love that all
of us had for her.  And we will all carry that love and pride with us
until the day we join her in what lies beyond.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s father had been fighting back tears during the entire speech,
trying to say what he had to say before he started crying and couldn&#39;t
stop.  But now that he had said it, he couldn&#39;t hold back any more.

&quot;I love you, Michi!&quot; he choked out between sobs.  &quot;I&#39;ll always love
you!&quot;

It was several minutes before he calmed down enough for Rei to lead him
back to his seat, where he embraced his wife and his daughters as hard
as he could.

After what seemed like an appropriate period of silence, Setsuna stood
and made her way to the front.

Setsuna looked down at her feet as she spoke.  Her already deep voice
was even lower than usual.  &quot;I like to think of myself as someone who
has seen it all and can&#39;t be surprised,&quot; she said.  &quot;But every now and
then, someone or something will come along and make me feel like I don&#39;t
know anything at all.  Kaioh Michiru was one of them.

&quot;I was amazed to see someone who could put everything else before
herself the way Michiru could.  To me it always seemed like she could
lose herself in anything, if she cared about it enough...and she cared
about a lot of things.  A lot of *people*,&quot; she added with a disturbing
inflection.

&quot;That always made me wonder if she knew how exceptional a person she
really was.  Sometimes it seemed as if she was trying to get away from
herself, how she could put everything else first, even when that was
dangerous.&quot;

Setsuna looked over her shoulder at the giant mural Michiru had painted,
depicting the end of the world.  Haruka had seen it at an art exhibition
one of the first times they had ever seen each other.

&quot;And sometimes I wondered if she was ever really happy with herself.  I
am not a psychologist.  I am not a counselor.  I&#39;m not even a romantic
person.  But I do know about time.  Some say it heals all wounds.  But I
know enough to know that this simply isn&#39;t true.  Some wounds are too
deep even for time to heal, and the loss of Kaioh Michiru is one of
them.&quot;  She looked at Rei, and around the shrine.  &quot;I&#39;m not a religious
person, either, but it is my prayer that if my impressions were correct,
that in death Michiru shall find the love for herself that everyone
around her had in life.  Thank you.&quot;

Setsuna began walking, but did not return to her seat.  She passed down
the aisle and continued on through the door.  No one stopped her.  As
she left, she could hear Usagi begin to speak on Michiru&#39;s behalf.  In
typical Usagi fashion, she was bawling.

&quot;I can&#39;t say I knew Michiru as well as you guys,&quot; Usagi choked, &quot;but I
still feel like...&quot;

The moon princess&#39; words grew too distant for Setsuna to hear.  As she
stepped outside, she could see a single, tall figure standing under a
sakura tree off in the distance.  A motorcycle was parked against the
tree.

-----

Haruka sighed with the wind as it blew through her hair and ruffled her
shirt.  She wanted to be in there.  Not in there with them, just in
there.  She owed too much to Michiru&#39;s memory not to be.

But no.  This was a gathering at which she just could not attend, an
Eden from which she had been cast out.

She couldn&#39;t show her face around the others.  And she couldn&#39;t face
Michiru&#39;s family, either, to tell them how she had been too weak to save
their daughter and sister.  Michiru&#39;s father had practically threatened
her if she ever hurt his daughter, and she had been powerless to keep
her from dying.  And Michiru&#39;s mother hadn&#39;t been at all in favor of the
idea of her daughter being in love with another woman.  That had taken
her a long time to get used to.

Still, she wondered why they even bothered.  How they found it in their
hearts to honor their self-declared enemy in their own house of worship
was beyond Haruka.  But maybe it was fitting, in a way.  In those last
moments when the two of them had been hanging somewhere between life and
death, Michiru had seemed to have made peace with her history.

So...shouldn&#39;t *she* do the same?  A part of Haruka&#39;s mind wondered.

Her enemies and friends-turned-enemies were all able to let Michiru go;
they were in the shrine doing that right now.  She was the only one
living in the past, unwilling to let go of a broken dream and open her
eyes.  Wouldn&#39;t Michiru have wanted her not to dwell on this?  Wouldn&#39;t
Michiru have wanted her to be happy?

She plucked a sakura blossom from the tree she stood beneath.  She
stared blankly at it for a few seconds, then crushed it in her hand.
The rest of the blossoms had ignored her, or they had grieved in the
amount of time it took her to turn her head.  Tenoh Haruka giveth, and
Tenoh Haruka taketh away.  No sweat off their backs.

But this wasn&#39;t a flower she was talking about.  It was the woman she
loved.  And there was more at stake here than some damn tree.

&quot;Who gives a fuck what you think anyway?!&quot; she cursed at the tree,
lashing out and throwing the shredded flower at it.

Seething, fists clenched, eyes scrunched up in rage, she pushed the
thoughts of forgiveness out of her head.  Yes, Michiru would have wanted
her to be happy, but what would make her happy was vengeance.  What
would make her happy was teaching everyone who deserved it exactly what
she was going through right now.

Only then could she put it all behind her.  Sailor Uranus, Neptune, and
Michiru.  Only then could she wake up.

Off in the distance, someone walked out of the shrine.  She could tell
by the waist-length, swamp water-colored hair that it was Setsuna.  The
two of them stood like that, motionless, watching each other, for a long
time.  After a while, Setsuna turned and walked back into the shrine.

-----

The rest of the funeral proceeded in Shinto tradition.  The gifts of the
koden were given to Michiru&#39;s family, and the givers wrote their names
in a book so they could later receive the kodengaeshi.  The procession
moved, one by one, into the room where Michiru lay in her coffin.  The
great wooden box was inlaid with brass and upholstered with serene white
cushion.  The pale body of the Senshi of the Sea slept there, unmoving.

The mourners placed a sakaki branch on the altar where the coffin lay.
Each said his or her own prayer, and moved on.

Usagi was the last to pray.  But when she was done, she remained there,
in front of the coffin.  For the moment, she had stopped crying.  She
was still there when Rei walked in to clean things up for the funeral
pyre.

&quot;Usagi...how long have you been standing there?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Huh?  What?&quot; Usagi stuttered.  &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you, Rei-chan...I don&#39;t know.
It&#39;s just, well, I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Rei sighed.  At times like this she grew impatient and would usually
snap at Usagi, but she would not disrespect Michiru&#39;s memory by allowing
anger into her place of rest.

&quot;What don&#39;t you know?&quot; she said eventually.

&quot;Look at her face,&quot; Usagi said.  &quot;It&#39;s almost like she&#39;s happy.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s anything right now.&quot;

&quot;She might be!  Maybe she can hear us?  Hey, can you hear *her*?&quot;

An ugly grimace spread across Rei&#39;s face.  She knew Usagi was asking if
her empathic talents were picking up anything.  They were: a world-class
dumb question.

&quot;*No*, Usagi.  Now move it, I have to clean this up before we light the
funeral pyre.  And you&#39;re about to miss the kuyo.&quot;

That got Usagi&#39;s attention.  She ran off to the next room while Rei
straightened things up.  After a minute or two, Rei looked around to
make sure no one was watching, and stood in front of the coffin again.
She peered over the edge at Michiru&#39;s lifeless face, and concentrated as
hard as she could.

But...no.  There was nothing there.  No thoughts, no feelings, nothing.
Not even a memory.  Michiru was really gone.  And Rei could only stand
there and wonder why.  The Outers had always said the holders of the
pure heart crystals had to be sacrificed, but Haruka had lived.  Why
hadn&#39;t Michiru?  It didn&#39;t make any sense.

&quot;Poor Michiru-san,&quot; she said, going back to her sweeping.  Then, as an
afterthought, she added, &quot;Poor Haruka-san.&quot;

-----

The otsuya, or the wake, saw Michiru&#39;s teary-eyed family standing next
to the eternally stone-faced Setsuna.  The two most able-bodied males in
attendance happened to be Mamoru and Yuuichiro, and they were in the
process of closing the coffin&#39;s lid and lifting it onto the funeral
pyre.

&quot;Where...&quot; Michiru&#39;s father began, and had to try again.  Setsuna then
realized he was talking to her.  &quot;Where is that girlfriend of my
daughter&#39;s?  Haruda?  Hikari?&quot;

&quot;Haruka,&quot; Setsuna filled in.

&quot;That&#39;s it.  Where is she?  I haven&#39;t seen her here anywhere the whole
time.&quot;

Setsuna sighed, thinking about how to answer this.  Grandpa Hino began
reading off some final words of prayer.

&quot;Haruka...well, she didn&#39;t take Michiru&#39;s death very well,&quot; Setsuna
explained.  &quot;She&#39;s disappeared.  We haven&#39;t seen her since it happened.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s father contorted his face as if this was something he&#39;d been
afraid of for a long time.  &quot;And where...where was she when Michiru...
when it happened?&quot;

&quot;She was with her.  She tried to fight off the enemy, but they defeated
her and stole her heart crystal as well.  The Sailor Senshi barely
arrived in time to save her.  Michiru...was already gone by then.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s father nodded.  He had the look of a man whose next door
neighbor had won the lottery.

Grandpa finished speaking, and closed the giant, old book he had been
reading from.  He looked at Rei, who passed him a torch.  Holding the
torch in front of him, he walked to where the coffin lay on a bed of
coals.  The torch was lowered, and the coals were ignited.  As the
coffin began to burn, Grandpa began praying again.  Rei and Yuuichiro
joined him.

The flickering light of the flame bathed the mourners, a last reminder
that Michiru was really gone.  The smoke rose in a column and escaped
through a hole in the roof.

Rei watched the pyre burn with detached interest.  It was so much like
her sacred flame, and so different.  One was life, and the other was
death.  In this one element, her element, was this balance of mortality.
But that was the essence of Shinto.

&lt;It&#39;s hot.&gt;

The priestess&#39; head jerked around.  She thought she had heard someone
say, &quot;It&#39;s hot,&quot; but the voice had seemed to come from everywhere at
once.  She looked around, and saw that no one else was doing the same.
They hadn&#39;t heard it.

Rei shook her head and put the voice out of her mind.  The fire was
really growing now, beginning to envelop the ends of the coffin.  But
then the voice returned.

&lt;It&#39;s really hot.  I don&#39;t like it.&gt;

This time there was no doubt the voice was real.  But she was obviously
hearing it only in her mind, or everyone else would have been able to
hear it.  Wait a minute...

&lt;It&#39;s hot!  It&#39;s hot!  Get it away from me!  Get it off me!&gt;

The voice was panicking now.  The fire had almost completely swallowed
the coffin.  Was this what Usagi had been asking about?  Could there
still be some part of Michiru that was still alive?  No, the voice
didn&#39;t sound anything like hers.  It was too high, too immature-sounding
to be Michiru.  But what other explanation was there?  Another person
inside the coffin?

&lt;It&#39;s on me!  Get it away!  It hurts!  It HUUUURRRRRTS!!!&gt;

Rei almost expected someone to start banging on the coffin from the
inside, but the only sound was the cracking of the burning wood.  It was
all burning now.  And as the voice screamed, Rei felt herself consumed
by its pain.  From out of nowhere, she felt like she was on fire too.

&quot;Aaaahhh!&quot; she cried, and fell over on her side.  Everyone turned their
eyes to the priestess writhing in pain.

&lt;It hurts!  It hurts!  HELP ME!!!&gt;

&quot;It hurts!  It hurts!  HELP ME!!!&quot;

Rei was unaware she had mimicked the voice, or that Yuuichiro had bent
over her and was trying to shake some sense into her.

&quot;Rei!  Wake up, Rei!  What&#39;s wrong?!&quot; Yuuichiro cried.

A soft creak was heard, and the coffin collapsed upon itself.  The voice
in Rei&#39;s head uttered a last, dying scream, and she did the same.  Every
single person gathered in the room was now standing over her, pelting
her and each other with questions.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?!&quot;

&quot;Is she OK?!&quot;

&quot;The hell&#39;s going on?!&quot;

As Rei&#39;s scream died out, the pain vanished as suddenly as it had come.
She found herself in Yuuichiro&#39;s arms, and Yuuichiro with panic in his
face.

&quot;Rei!  What happened?&quot; asked Yuuichiro.

Usagi wormed her way through the crowd and kneeled down to where they
were sitting.  &quot;Tell us what happened, Rei-chan!&quot;

Rei took a deep breath.  &quot;I...I don&#39;t know...I heard this voice scream
about something being hot, and something hurting, and then I felt this
horrible, burning sensation.  I don&#39;t know what it was.&quot;

&quot;Do you need a doctor?&quot; asked Ami.

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Rei said.  &quot;There&#39;s no damage on me...&quot;

In their fixation on Rei, everyone failed to notice that the coffin was
almost completely gone now, and the column of smoke was starting to die
out.

From somewhere outside, the sound of a motorcycle&#39;s engine and squealing
tires was heard.

-----

Whatever the past was, my eyes were open now, and if I had anything to
stay about it, they were staying open.

End chapter three.

-----

Author&#39;s notes:
I looked up the rituals for a Shinto funeral, and have tried to write
them into the story as well as I could.  The koden is a gift of money
that the mourners give the family of the deceased, and the kodengaeshi
is a gift of money that the family gives back to them a few weeks later,
usually half as much as they originally received.  Sakaki is a type of
evergreen camellia.  Kuyo is a meal that (in modern times) consists of
tea and cakes.  It is a solemn affair.

As for Michiru&#39;s family...I never read the manga and the anime doesn&#39;t
tell us jack about them.  So, my version of them is based on what I
considered the best fanfic about them.  That would be Lex Tenou&#39;s &quot;Kaiou
and Tenou Meet Haruka and Michiru.&quot;  Of course, I did my own thing with
them.  If you haven&#39;t read that, you should.  But be warned, it&#39;s kind
of explicit.
