<h1>Two Lonely People (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kenneday.html">John deGraffenreid</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/2lonely-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Greetings once again ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to chapter four of
Two Lonely People. I know that the last chapter was short, I hope I can
correct that with this chapter. I don&#39;t know how long this end up being
but I hope you all like the story thus far. Once again I don&#39;t own any
of the Sailor Moon characters so please don&#39;t sue me.

Author&#39;s Notes: I thought I would put a little message here for
everyone who&#39;s been reading this story and wondering just what it&#39;s all
about. At its core this story is about loneliness. Loneliness is not a
fun thing to feel. Believe me I know. I&#39;ve known what it&#39;s like to feel
lonely since I was seven. I felt that way for a very long time. I don&#39;t
feel it much anymore but I hate for anyone to feel like they have no
friends. Lets all try and be kind to each other, maybe between us we
can eliminate loneliness all together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As the day moved on Minako and Makoto spent their time shopping and
talking of things past. As they walked through the mall Minako looked
over at her friend and secret love and thought to herself how much
happier Makoto would be if she only knew that someone really did love
her for who she was. That the terrible loneliness that threatened to
consume her didn&#39;t have to. She thought for a moment then looked at her
friend again.

&quot;Hey Makoto-chan I have an idea.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that Minako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Well you shared some of your favorite movies with me last night and I
thought I would return the favor. I know something about you that the
others don&#39;t so you&#39;ll get to find out something about me tonight. How
does that sound?&quot; Makoto looked over at her friend and smiled warmly.

&quot;Sounds like a plan to my Minako-chan; it&#39;s a date then.&quot; Chuckling she
then turned back to task at hand and began shopping in earnest. Minako
was blushing at this point but that fact seemed to go unnoticed by
Makoto. The rest of the day seemed to fly by as Minako reveled in being
so close to Makoto. They shared laughs at some of the hideous clothing
that sells at brand name stores. As the day was turning to evening they
went back to Makoto&#39;s car and drove a short ways before Makoto spoke
up.

&quot;So what&#39;s this surprise you have for me Minako-chan?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see Makoto-chan, can you drop me off at my place and then meet
me at the new Karaoke place at the corner of Takeuchi drive?&quot;

&quot;Sure, sounds like a plan to me.&quot; With that Makoto dropped her friend
off at her home and drove back to her own apartment to get ready for
that night. As she busied herself she couldn&#39;t help but wonder at why
she suddenly felt so nervous about going to a simple Karaoke place with
Minako. It couldn&#39;t be that maybe it was because she had seen through
the act could it? She thought. I&#39;ve been pretending for so long so I
wouldn&#39;t lose my friends, she couldn&#39;t have figured out why all my
relationships fail could it? She busied herself finishing getting ready
so she wouldn&#39;t think about it so much. After an hour or so she was
finally satisfied with what she was wearing and decided that it was
time to leave. One last check in the mirror, forest-green slacks, black
button up shirt, forest green blazer and tie, yup this looks good she
decided as she headed out her door to the Bunny on the Moon Karaoke
Palace. She laughed when she saw the name, wondering what Usagi would
think about it. Shaking her head she walked in and quickly found
Minako. When they saw each other Makoto was stunned at what she saw.
Minako was dressed in an elegant, but not formal, golden dress that
accentuated her sapphire blue eyes. Gone was her typical bow, letting
her sun-blonde hair flow freely down her back. She didn&#39;t even know her
jaw was open until Minako spoke up.

&quot;You can close you mouth now Makoto-chan you&#39;re drooling, though its
nice to know at least someone is affected that way by how I look.&quot; She
giggled at this and led Makoto to their table where they had a good
look at the people there. One couple in particular seemed to be
genuinely happy. They were two women on with long, lavender hair that
flowed freely except for the two odangos that were styled into it, her
companion was another stunningly beautiful girl with fiery red hair
styled into a ponytail. Neither was as beautiful as Minako though she
thought, not bothering to argue with her heart for once. Truth be told
she always had a thing for Minako but ever since the incident at her
first Junior High school she had never acted on her feelings, after all
it was just to painful. Besides it was obvious that Minako was straight
what with all the boyfriends she had. &#39;You mean like all of your former
boyfriends&#39; her heart asked. Ignoring it the two friends talked and
patiently waited their turn to sing. They laughed as a group of three,
a young black haired boy and two women tried to be civil but the two
women falling to insults quite frequently. Laughing, Makoto leaned
forward and asked Minako if the feuding women reminded her of anyone
they knew. With a light laugh Minako acknowledged this and soon their
turn to sing came up. As they approached the microphones Makoto
belatedly wondered what song Minako had chosen for them to sing, as it
was obvious she had chosen something before she got there. The music
started, as what sounded like a motorcycle being revved was the first
thing she heard followed by a piano and electric guitar. Leaning over
Minako whispered to her.

&quot;Let me sing first I&#39;ll signal you when you&#39;re part comes up.&quot; Smiling
Makoto nodded her agreement. Minako&#39;s voice filled the small building
as she began to sing, all the while staring intently at Makoto.

&quot;And I would do anything for love, I&#39;d run right into Hell and back I
would do anything for love, I&#39;d never lie to you and that&#39;s a fact.

(At this point Minako places her hand on Makoto&#39;s cheek and continues
to sing)

But I&#39;ll never forget the way you feel right now-Oh no-no way-I would
do Anything for love, but I won&#39;t do that, anything for love, I would
do anything for love, I would do anything for love, but I won&#39;t do that

Some days it don&#39;t come easy, some days it don&#39;t come hard, some days
it don&#39;t come at all and these are the days that never end.

Some nights you&#39;re breathing fire, some nights you&#39;re carved in ice

Some nights you&#39;re like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before or will again.

Maybe I&#39;m crazy, but its crazy and its true, I know you can save me no
one else can save me now but you.

As long as the planets are turning, as long as the stars are burning,
as long as your dreams are coming true-you better believe it

That I would do anything for love, and I&#39;ll be there until the final
act-I would do anything for love-and I&#39;ll take a vow and seal the pact

But I&#39;ll never forgive myself if we don&#39;t go all the way-tonight-I
would do anything for love, I would do anything for love, I would do
anything for love but I won&#39;t do that

I would do anything for love, anything you&#39;ve been dreaming of but I
just won&#39;t do that

Some days I pray for silence, some days I pray for soul, some days I
just pray to the God of sex and drums and rock and roll!

Some nights I lose the feeling and some night I lose control, some
nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

Maybe I&#39;m lonely, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m qualified to be, there&#39;s just one
and only, the one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning, as long as the fires are burning, as
long as your prayers are coming true-you better believe it

That I would do anything for love! And you know its true and that&#39;s a
fact, I would do anything for love! And there&#39;ll never be no turning
back

But I&#39;ll never do it better than I do it with you, so long, so long-I
would do anything for love, I would do anything for love, I would do
anything for love, but I won&#39;t do that

I would do anything for love, anything you&#39;ve been dreaming of, I would
do anything for love but I won&#39;t do that

But I&#39;ll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life-no way-

I would do anything for love, I would do anything for love, I would do
anything for love but I won&#39;t do that

At this point Makoto was tearing up and at Minako&#39;s signal she began to
sing her part.

Makoto: Will you raise me up? Will you help me down? Will you help me
get out of this God forsaken town? Will you make it all a little less
cold?

Minako: I can do that! I can do that!

Makoto: Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight? Will you
colorize my life I&#39;m so sick of black and white? Can you make it all a
little less old?

Minako: I can do that! I can do that!

Taking Minako&#39;s hand Makoto puts more emotion into her singing.

Makoto: Will you make me some magic with your own two hands? Can you
build an emerald city with these grains of sand? Can you give me
something I can take home?

Minako: I can do that! I can do that!

Makoto: Will you cater to every fantasy I got? Will you hose me down
with holy water if I get to hot? Will you take me to places I&#39;ve never
known?

Minako: I can do that! I can do that!

Everyone in the place is listening to the two women pour their hearts
into the song, even the two women who were fighting at the beginning
are on the verge of tears as they listen.

Makoto: After a while you&#39;ll forget everything. It was a brief
interlude, and a midsummer night&#39;s fling, and you&#39;ll see that its time
to move on.

Minako: I won&#39;t do that! I won&#39;t do that!

Makoto is openly crying now as she finishes her part of the song,
looking deeply into Minako&#39;s loving eyes

Makoto: I know the territory, I&#39;ve been around. It&#39;ll all turn to dust
and we&#39;ll all fall down, sooner or later you&#39;ll be screwing around.

Taking Makoto by the shoulders

Minako: I won&#39;t do that! I won&#39;t do that!

Minako: Anything for love, I would do anything for love, I would do
anything for love, but I won&#39;t do that.

As the two women finished singing they embraced each other, not minding
the thunderous applause as two lonely people finally found in each
other the love they so desperately longed for.

Author&#39;s notes: The song Anything for Love was written by Jim Steinman
and I in no way own it so please don&#39;t sue me. Well there it is, the
finale of Two Lonely People. Will there be a sequel? I don&#39;t know yet.
Maybe yes, maybe no, it depends on the other stories I&#39;ll be writing
soon. I hope you all liked it. Drop me a line sometime and let me know
ok? I love getting emails from you guys.
