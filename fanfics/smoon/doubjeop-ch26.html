A smile to avoid parting

Doesn&#39;t contain promises.

-English translation lyrics from La Soldier

&quot;It&#39;s going to rain again,&quot; said Makoto as she smiled up at the sky.

Ami nodded, then said quietly, &quot;Yes, it is. It rained last night too.&quot;

&quot;I like it when it rains. It&#39;s almost as if the whole world is clean 
just for a little while.&quot;

Ami looked down as she replied, &quot;I suppose that&#39;s one way of looking at 
it.&quot;

&quot;And I like this tree here, especially this time of year. Green and full 
of life, with the sun shining through the leaves. . . . well, on a sunny 
day, anyway.&quot; Makoto smiled up at the nearby tree affectionately, then 
added, &quot;I planted that one twelve years ago, I think. I think it&#39;s done 
pretty good over the years.&quot;

This time, Ami put her hand on Makoto&#39;s cheek, gently turning her face 
so that they were looking into each other&#39;s eyes. After a moment, Ami 
said, &quot;You are aware that I will not think any less of you if you become 
. . . emotional, right? What I mean is . . . I know you always try to be 
strong but . . . in this case . . .What I mean to say is, it is 
understandable, Mako-chan.&quot;

Finally, Makoto looked down at her parents&#39; tombstone, letting her smile 
fade away. She pulled a business card out of her pocket and put it in 
the small slot next to the marker before saying, &quot;No . . .I almost never 
cry for them here. I usually cry while I&#39;m cooking for myself while 
reading Dad&#39;s recipe cards, or I get Mom&#39;s sewing kit out or something. 
Probably sounds silly to you, but . . .&quot;

Ami squeezed Makoto&#39;s hand, trying to be reassuring. &quot;No, it doesn&#39;t.&quot;

Makoto scoffed as a small smile returned to her lips. &quot;Good answer. 
Besides, that&#39;s not why I brought you here with me anyway.&quot;

Makoto bowed politely before her family&#39;s marker, then said, &quot;Mother, 
Father, I&#39;d like to introduce you to someone special to me.&quot;

It took Ami another moment to realize that Makoto was waiting for her. 
Ami bowed, placed the flowers they brought with them in the grave 
marker&#39;s vase then said, &quot;I am Sensei Mizuno Ami. I teach science at the 
local junior high school, and I . . .&quot; She hesitated a moment, then, as 
a light blush came to her cheeks, she whispered nervously, &quot;I&#39;m . . . um 
. . . also dating your daughter.&quot;

Makoto put her arm around Ami, squeezing her close as she said, &quot;See? 
That wasn&#39;t so hard, was it?&quot;

&quot;Well, you see it is the anniversary of their deaths, and this is the 
first time I have met your parents and and and . . . and . . .&quot;

&quot;Ami?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

Makoto&#39;s smile grew just a little bigger as she said, &quot;You do know 
they&#39;re dead, right? You don&#39;t need to be nervous.&quot;

Ami put an arm around Makoto, drawing her close as she re-read the 
marker before them. A few drops of water were starting to fall from the 
sky, but neither of them bothered to move.

Ami&#39;s voice sounded curious as she said, &quot;To my knowledge, you never 
told any of us you were named after your father.&quot;

Makoto shrugged. &quot;What can I say? Mom had her heart set on a little boy, 
and dad wasn&#39;t against letting me play with trucks as long as I learned 
to cook. I suppose someday we might get to ask them about it . . .&quot;

Suddenly, Ami couldn&#39;t help it. She felt her eyes start to water as 
realization dawned on her. &quot;It must be hard for you, knowing how long we 
are going to live, when you come here.&quot;

Makoto just shrugged again and tightened her arms around Ami. &quot;It does. 
It&#39;s just . . . well, you&#39;re an intelligent woman, Ami-chan. Surly you 
know that we are all going to have to deal with this in our own way 
eventually. I just had to deal with it first. Well . . . Rei too, I 
suppose.&quot; Makoto tilted her head, indicating a far corner of the 
cemetery, saying, &quot;Rei&#39;s mother is buried down that way, somewhere.&quot;

Makoto watched Ami as she studied the flowers in their vase, feeling 
somewhat guilty for putting such a dark thought in her girlfriend&#39;s 
mind.

Neither of them moved for several moments, until the light rain started 
to pick up just a little. Makoto said softly, &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s drop off 
the other bundle of flowers for Rei&#39;s mother and get back to the car. 
There isn&#39;t any point in staying here now that we have done what we came 
here to do.&quot;

As Makoto guided Ami away, puddles started to form on the ground.

One puddle in particular caught a great reflection of Makoto as they 
passed by.

Then, the water rippled and started to take on a form. It was as if 
someone made of clear water were climbing out of it. All too quickly, 
the shape gained color and mass as it started following the two visitors 
down the lonely path through the rain.

----------

Rei was certain that Mina had heard her when she entered the room, but 
it seemed she chose to ignore her and continue to stare out the window, 
watching the rain, lost in her own thoughts. To Rei, it was as if the 
Sekkou was gazing at her own reflection in the glass, almost as if 
begging it for an answer.

It became clear rather quickly to Rei that Mina was waiting for her to 
speak first. After a few minutes, Rei moved closer and said, &quot;So, you 
now have a decision to make.&quot;

Mina started to turn toward her, then thought better of it and shifted 
her attention back to the window. She asked, &quot;About what?&quot;

Rei put her hand on the other woman&#39;s shoulder as she said, &quot;I think you 
know. If I had to guess, I&#39;d say it&#39;s the same thing you&#39;re thinking 
about right now.&quot;

At those words, Rei felt Mina&#39;s shoulder slump just a bit as a quiet 
sigh escaped her lips. Mina finally glanced over her shoulder at Rei, 
saying, &quot;They&#39;ll be back, and soon. You know that, right?&quot;

&quot;Then you know what decision I&#39;m speaking of, Mina. If you won&#39;t say it, 
then I will. You are going to have to choose between me and them when 
they come back, and you know it.&quot; Rei gazed into Mina&#39;s eyes, then said, 
&quot;And I know you have already made up your mind. So, what&#39;s it going to 
be?&quot;

For a moment, nothing mattered and Mina got lost in Rei&#39;s eyes. Then the 
question registered in her mind. She opened her mouth to speak, but 
before words left her lips, Rei caught just the slightest hint of 
annoyance in the other&#39;s eyes an instant before she found her hand being 
brushed away. Without a word, Mina turned back to the window.

Rei looked at her hand, trying to keep her anger in check. Between 
clenched teeth, she growled, &quot;Don&#39;t you dare push me away. I can forgive 
you for whatever your answer is, but damn it, you are going to tell me 
what it is, and why. I deserve that much.&quot;

Rather than answer Rei&#39;s question, Mina asked, &quot;You said yesterday, that 
we can not escape our destiny, but what about ourselves?&quot;

Rei walked forward slowly, then put her hand back on Mina&#39;s shoulder. 
She gave it a gentle squeeze then asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Do you think that people can change, Rei?&quot;

Mina&#39;s words were so soft that at first, Rei wasn&#39;t sure she had 
actually spoken. Feeling as if she were walking on thin ice, Rei 
replied, &quot;Yes, I suppose. If we truly wish to change as individuals, we 
can. In a way . . . one might say that it&#39;s a part of one&#39;s destiny.&quot;

Still facing the window, Mina scoffed, then said, &quot;Why did I know that&#39;s 
what you were going to say? You speak with such authority on such 
matters.&quot;

Even though Mina couldn&#39;t see it, Rei shrugged. &quot;There was a time when a 
Miko&#39;s words were considered to come directly from the divine 
spirits.&quot;Trying to get her companion to stop hiding, Rei said, &quot;Don&#39;t 
think I&#39;m letting you off the hook that easily, though. I did notice you 
avoided answering me.&quot;

Mina turned and faced Rei, letting a smile form on her lips before she 
said cryptically, &quot;You already know my decision, Rei, and if you search 
your heart, I think you already know why I came to that answer for 
myself . . . and for you.&quot;

Before Rei could ask more, her wrist communicator clicked on. Makoto was 
yelling so loud, that Rei couldn&#39;t make out what she was saying. It 
switched off just as quickly, filling the room with the sound of static. 
At least Rei knew where she was. There was only one place Makoto would 
be today.

Without a word, Rei grabbed Mina&#39;s wrist and started running for the 
door as fast as she could.

Ready for it or not, it was time to find out just what it was that 
destiny had in store for them.

----------

Dark Saturn ripped Makoto&#39;s wristwatch off, tossed it on the ground and 
crushed it with her foot in one fluid motion. Then she did her best to 
regain a hold on Makoto.

This time, Makoto sunk her teeth deep into Dark Saturn&#39;s arm in an 
attempt to get at least one of her attackers off of her. All she earned 
for her efforts was a sharp punch to the stomach by Dark Pluto, who 
finally was able to rip Makoto&#39;s transformation wand away from her. Then 
she tossed it far from them.

Trista tightened her free arm around Makoto&#39;s neck even more as she 
whispered, &quot;Well, well, it seems we do not get along, nor play well with 
others.&quot; She ripped her arm out of Makoto&#39;s jaws, and smacked the butt 
of her glaive against the back of Makoto&#39;s head, watching with no small 
amount of satisfaction as Amara and Michelle released her, allowing her 
to crumple to the ground. Then the four Sekkou turned as one, ready to 
take on their other opponent.

Even before they started moving to assist, they already knew the fight 
would be over long before they reached them.

To her credit, Ami had at least had time to transform into Sailor 
Mercury, and was fending off Dark Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter. Still, she 
was clearly on the defensive, and it was only a matter of time before 
one or more of the three would land a decisive blow.

Dodging an attack from her opponent, Lita was able to get a grip on 
Ami&#39;s arm, then simply tossed her as if she were nothing more than a rag 
doll. Ami crashed into an older tombstone, turning it into rubble, and 
lay still.

When she didn&#39;t try to get up, Lita walked up to the Senshi, then gave 
her a quick kick to her gut. Other than a loud groan, she didn&#39;t react. 
&quot;Not so tough without a pill crusher, are you, you little . . .&quot; She 
stopped talking when she felt a hand carefully entwine its self in hers. 
She twirled on her heels, expecting another fight, stopping herself when 
she realized who it was.

Amy looked down at her double with a look that might have been sympathy. 
Not taking her eyes off of their downed opponent, she said quietly, 
&quot;That&#39;s enough, Lita. Let&#39;s just finish what we came here for.&quot;

Ami lay on her back, partially covered by the rubble of the tombstone 
she had crashed into. The rain slapping against her somehow managed to 
make her look even more vulnerable. While she had little love for Ami, 
Amy couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for her.

Lita said, &quot;But she hit me over the head with a--!&quot;

This time Amy growled, &quot;You can have your way with her later. We have a 
specific goal in mind, and anything more would interfere with our 
plans.&quot;

Lita had heard enough. After giving Ami another kick, she turned her 
attention to Amy. With the adrenaline flowing through her blood still 
affecting her thoughts, she grabbed Amy by the collar and lifted her off 
the ground. &quot;Our plans? Our plans? Let me tell you something about our 
plans. You threw a real monkey wrench into those when you willingly 
opened the door wide for Beryl&#39;s little pet, Trista, to --&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot;

Lita glared at Trista, and obediently put Amy back down before she was 
ordered to.

This time, Trista grabbed Lita by the collar, jerking her within inches 
of her face. &quot;We will accomplish nothing by fighting each other. I don&#39;t 
care if you have a problem following Beryl&#39;s commands, but you will obey 
me when I command you. I may not have the power Beryl does, but I 
promise you I can be far more creative, if less effective, than she is 
when it comes to inflicting pain.&quot; Looking around at her small audience, 
she added for their benefit, &quot;That goes for all of you!&quot;

A soft groan brought Trista&#39;s attention back to the matter at hand. She 
tossed Lita back, then turned, entertained by the sight of Makoto 
pulling herself to her feet.

Trista held up a hand to signal the others to back off. &quot;You recovered 
from our onslaught quickly. Impressive.&quot; Then she swung the Silent 
Glaive in front of her, pointing the blade at Makoto.

Makoto forced herself to straighten up and look her opponent in the 
eyes. She tilted her head to the side, cracking her neck and stretching 
before saying, &quot;You&#39;ll find out I&#39;m full of surprises.&quot;

A demented smile spread across Trista&#39;s face. &quot;I&#39;m sure I will.&quot; Then to 
her comrades, she said, &quot;She&#39;s mine.&quot;

Ray folded her arms across her chest and grumbled, &quot;You&#39;re going to take 
her on by yourself? Why&#39;d you even bother to bring us along? You want us 
to just sit here and--&quot;

Circling her opponent, Trista said, &quot;I brought you to take care of 
them.&quot;

Before Ray could ask more, a blast of fire slammed into her, tossing her 
to the ground. Without any argument, the rest of the unoccupied Sekkou 
moved to quickly circle Mina and Rei.

As the two pressed their backs against each other, Sailor Mars said, 
&quot;Well, that got their attention. Now what?&quot;

Dark Venus shrugged. &quot;Don&#39;t ask me. You&#39;re the brains of this outfit, 
remember?&quot;

Before anyone could throw the first blow, Hotaru turned a concerned gaze 
back over her shoulder, watching the fight between Makoto and Trista, 
then said, &quot;We have bigger things to deal with at the moment. Don&#39;t 
worry about your friend, Mina. I have the perfect way to keep her 
occupied.&quot;

She stared into Rei&#39;s eyes a moment, then read a near by tombstone 
absently before whispering, &quot;Summoning of the necromancer.&quot; Then she 
calmly walked away to get a closer observation of her companion&#39;s 
progress in her fight against Makoto. And also to continue in her place 
should she fall.

Rei watched in horror as the marble family crypt that held her 
relatives&#39; ashes shattered. A lone urn rose out of the debris with a 
soft glow surrounding it. There was a flash of bright light, then the 
urn cracked open. Despite the rain, ash began swirling around, quickly 
taking form. A form Rei hadn&#39;t seen for many years.

Mina started to try to guide Rei away, but was rushed by several of the 
remaining Sekkou and dragged forcibly away, leaving Rei to fend for 
herself.

Sailor Mars looked at the woman, unable to think clearly. She was even 
more beautiful than she remembered. But then, her memories had faded 
with time.

She looked similar to Rei, only even in death, Akako Hino seemed to 
posses a calm Rei could only dream of. Her body moved for the first time 
in well over a decade, as she slowly opened her eyes. Other than a 
slight pail grayish white color that tinted her skin, she looked just as 
she had the last time Rei had seen her.

Rei felt like the woman was looking into her very soul. Totally 
forgetting the situation she was in, she said in shock, &quot;Mother? Is that 
you? . . . Can you hear me?&quot;

Her burial kimono billowed around her as Rei&#39;s mother stepped forward. 
When she spoke, her words brought a chill to Rei&#39;s soul. &quot;You have been 
nothing but a disappointed to me in my absence, Rei.&quot;

----------

Once Amy, Lita, Ray, Amara, and Michelle had Mina far enough away from 
prying ears, they formed a tight circle around her, and began their 
discussion. They each spoke, filling in bits and pieces of their 
proposition until they were certain that Mina understood what they were 
asking.

Glaring at Amy, Mina said, &quot;Let me get this straight. You trick me into 
getting stuck here to get revenge on me for tearing you to pieces all 
those years ago, and now you&#39;re upset because Beryl put Trista in 
charge, even though you had a pretty good idea she would do that once I 
was gone . . . and now . . . you come crawling to me on your knees, 
begging me to return?&quot;

Amy nodded her head. &quot;Precisely. In my blind zeal for revenge, I failed 
to notice an error with my plan. I did not fully realize Trista and 
Hotaru&#39;s goals to be incompatible with our own until it was too late.&quot;

Mina glanced at Amara and Michelle. &quot;You two are their right hand girls. 
What do you get out of this?&quot;

Amara growled, &quot;We never wanted a hand in any of this. Had it been up to 
us, we would have rather died than become the monsters that we are. Once 
we learned of Serena&#39;s plan, we realized she had the right idea. But her 
plan was flawed.&quot;

Michelle stepped toward Mina, then continued for her lover, &quot;But once we 
learned Amy&#39;s original plan, we realized that hers had a high 
probability of succeeding. What we &#39;get out of it&#39; is the same thing you 
want. Freedom. It&#39;s as simple as that.&quot;

Ray nodded her head in agreement with them, then said, &quot;With their help, 
our plan isn&#39;t as hopeless as we originally thought. We can spring our 
trap on Beryl far more effectively than we ever thought possible. We 
only need to play her game a little longer. The only thing missing from 
our strategy, is . . . you.&quot;

Mina looked at them, unable to hide her disbelief. &quot;And . . . what do I 
get by coming back to the fold?&quot;

Lita spread her hands out, and said calmly, &quot;Whatever the hell you 
want.&quot;

Amy studied Mina a moment before finishing for all of them. &quot;So, what do 
you want, Mina?&quot;

&quot;I want . . . What I want, none of you can give me.&quot; She started to turn 
to watch Rei, but Ray moved to block her view.

Ray said in as seductive a voice as she could manage, &quot;You don&#39;t need to 
accept a substitute. I can be everything she is to you. Everything . . . 
and more, for you.&quot;

Mina stared into Ray&#39;s eyes, searching the other woman&#39;s soul. She&#39;d 
longed to hear those words whispered, and dreamed even more of the 
promises such words would bring her during a cold dark night. But as she 
gazed into those violet eyes . . . she saw none of the passion, or love, 
that Rei held when their eyes met. All she saw was . . . darkness and . 
. . coldness. Death.

In that instant of realization, part of Mina wondered if that was what 
Rei saw when she looked at her. Part of her began to doubt Rei&#39;s 
intentions and love . . . but another part, from deep within her soul, 
rose out like a demon from the fiery depths of hell, over riding all of 
the doubts and discomforts. Destroying the what ifs that dwelt within 
her.

Mina pushed Ray, sending her falling to the muddy ground. As rain poured 
around them, Mina glared down at her and barked, &quot;You will NEVER be able 
to be who she is to me. NEVER!&quot;

Amara stepped over Ray, and grabbed Mina&#39;s shoulders, giving her a rough 
shake to get her attention. &quot;Then what is it going to take? You name it, 
we&#39;ll do it.&quot;

Mina looked down at Ray in thought. The Sekkou of Fire lay in the mud, 
staring up at her with more hatred and contempt than any being should 
ever have been capable of. She had unimaginable power and strength. They 
all did. But she did not possess the fire that burned within Rei&#39;s soul. 
She didn&#39;t possess the kindness, the love . . . anything that Rei had.

That lack of . . . life . . . was the one thing all of the Sekkou had in 
common.

Mina stepped away from Amara and looked at each of them in turn, saying, 
&quot;I want her untouched and un-harmed. I know it complicates our plan . . 
. but, that is my condition. When we are through with the rest of them, 
we will leave her be, to live out the rest of her days in peace.&quot;

She then turned and regarded them each as individuals. As the soldiers 
they were, if only in the depths of what remained of their hearts, 
searching for any sign of deceit. She found absolutely none. &quot;Do we have 
an agreement?&quot;

The gathered Sekkou said together, almost like ghosts in the night, 
&quot;Agreed.&quot;

They then went to join Hotaru in observing the fight being waged nearby 
to keep Makoto in check, leaving Mina to save Rei.

If it wasn&#39;t too late to do so already.

----------

Rei&#39;s mother said calmly, &quot;You have lied to your beloved grandfather, 
and you never truly tried to develop a meaningful relationship with a 
decent man. You are sick. Perverted and filthy. You are nothing more 
than an abomination, unworthy of being called my daughter.&quot;

Rei tried to step back, but tripped instead over her own feet. As her 
mother loomed over her, Rei pleaded, &quot;No . . . No . . . You&#39;re proud of 
me. You . . . Everything I&#39;ve accomplished . . . I&#39;m a Senshi . . . I 
help Grandpa . . . I . . . I . . .&quot; Rei was grateful for the heavy rain 
since it was the only thing that would hide her tears.

She forced herself to stand, and grabbed her mother&#39;s Kimono, shaking 
her weakly. &quot;How can you say those things when you wear that cross 
around your neck? All those things you taught me about faith and 
forgiveness . . . If I have offended you . . . you&#39;re supposed to 
forgive me . . . You&#39;re . . . you&#39;re . . .&quot;

Akako shook her head, then said angrily, &quot;No. You are nothing more than 
a heathen, just like your grandfather. A witch. A sinner. I will never 
forgive you.&quot;

Rei felt her head slump down as she cried harder. She had always 
wondered what her mother thought of her. She didn&#39;t know if she would 
approve of everything . . . but this . . . surely this was more than she 
deserved.

&quot;There is only one way you can make your shortcomings and dishonor up to 
me, my child.&quot;

Suddenly feeling hope fill the huge gash that had been made in her soul, 
Rei looked up.

Astonishingly strong fingers suddenly wrapped around Rei&#39;s neck, 
squeezing tighter than should ever have been possible for such slender, 
delicate hands. Akako rasped, &quot;You must die, Rei Hino. Repent, and come 
to heaven . . . Come back with me.&quot;

Rei realized the trap too late. She started to struggle against the iron 
grip around her throat, but was unable to free herself. Already, she 
could see flashes of color sparking before her eyes.

As the zombie started to laugh, Rei began digging her nails into the 
flesh of Akako&#39;s arms, causing small flakes of ash to scrape off and mix 
with the mud and rain.

Akako&#39;s voice suddenly decayed to something inhuman as she shrieked, 
&quot;How foolish you are! Now you may have the honor of joining your mother 
in hell!&quot;

Rei shook her head no, despite the fact that it made her feel dizzier. A 
part of her mind screamed that there was no way this, this thing, was 
her mother, demanding Rei defend herself. Despite this realization, the 
other half of her mind just couldn&#39;t bring herself to fight back.

Just as Rei thought she was about to lose consciousness, a blast of 
bright yellow light flew through Akako, causing the abomination to 
scream in anger. Mina&#39;s next attack blasted her back to ashes which 
quickly turned to a pile of gray mush in the rain.

Rei fell to the ground, panting for breath. Between gasps, she managed 
to gasp out, &quot;Thank you,&quot; as she twisted her head to look at Mina.

Dark Venus walked up to Rei and helped her to her feet. Then she gave 
Rei a hug. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Rei, but this is for the best.&quot; Before Rei could 
inquire further, Mina grabbed the sides of Rei&#39;s head with both hands, 
forced her to bend over, and violently kneed her in the forehead.

Once Rei lost consciousness, Mina gently lowered her to the ground. 
After giving one last longing look back at Rei, she turned and ran to 
the aid of her fellow Sekkou.

----------

Despite pouring rain and being totally unarmed, Makoto had held her own 
against Trista rather well. And now, the Sekkou had left her the perfect 
opening.

Makoto delivered another punch to her opponent, followed by a kick to 
Trista&#39;s stomach, causing the Sekkou of Death to fall on her knees. As 
the woman gasped for breath, Makoto ripped Trista&#39;s glaive out of her 
hands, then smashed the shaft of the weapon across the Sekkou&#39;s face, 
sending her straight on the flat of her back.

With expert skill, Makoto twirled the deadly weapon for a moment in her 
hands, then pinned Dark Saturn in place by pressing her foot on her 
chest. When Trista started to push herself up, Makoto pressed the deadly 
blade against her throat just enough to coax the woman to lie back down.

Despite not taking her eyes off of her opponent for even a second, 
Makoto knew the rest of the Sekkou had surrounded her quite some time 
ago. What bothered her, was that they hadn&#39;t attacked . . . yet. &quot;What 
are your &#39;friends&#39; waiting for?&quot;

Trista casually looked up at Makoto and said, &quot;They wait for you to 
finish me. Has it taken you this long to realize? No matter what you do 
now, you are lost. Surrender now, and I&#39;ll make your death mercifully 
quick.&quot;

A sound off to the side caused both of them to risk a glance away from 
the other. Mina and Lita had dragged Ami closer to them. Ami, still 
dazed and laying on the ground, coughed and blinked her eyes weakly, 
while Rei lay beside her, still unconscious.

Makoto turned her eyes back to Trista and said, &quot;Leave them alone.&quot;

Trista laughed, stopping only when Makoto pressed her foot down on the 
woman&#39;s ribs. When Trista was able to talk again, she asked, &quot;What makes 
you think we are even after them?&quot;

Without warning, Trista sent a blast of energy crashing into Makoto, 
knocking her away, and the Silent Glaive fell free from her grip. As she 
rose to her feet and retrieved her weapon, she said, &quot;It&#39;s too bad we 
were able to prevent you from fighting as a Senshi. You would have been 
far more challenging.&quot;

Makoto forced herself to stand, despite screaming pain in her joints. 
&quot;Powers or not, I&#39;m going to kick your ass.&quot;

Ami&#39;s senses returned to her, and when she saw what was happening, she 
started to stand while screaming &quot;Makoto! No!&quot; Before she could run to 
her aid, Mina and Lita grabbed her arms, restraining her.

Even if it hadn&#39;t been too late, Makoto was too blinded by rage to have 
listened, nor would there have been enough time to come up with a better 
plan. Ignoring Ami&#39;s screams, Makoto charged the Sekkou.

Dark Saturn shook her head, and said, &quot;Foolish.&quot; This time, she was 
ready.

Trista dodged the first punch Makoto threw, then twirled the glaive so 
that the staff crashed against Makoto&#39;s forearm, shattering bone. Then, 
not giving Makoto any time to recover, Trista slashed the blade of her 
weapon across Makoto&#39;s back, following up with a ruthless kick to her 
kidneys. She took a step back, like a cat playing with a mouse before 
making the final kill.

Makoto twirled around, still managing to stay on her feet. Despite the 
brave front she put up, it was obvious from the way she nursed her arm 
that she was in pain. When she realized that Trista was waiting for her 
to bring the fight to her, she did the only thing she could.

Turning just enough to look at Ami, she asked, &quot;I&#39;m open to 
suggestions.&quot;

Ami cried, &quot;Makoto forget about us! Run!&quot;

Makoto shrugged as best she could saying, &quot;You know, I never run unless 
I&#39;m being chased. Besides, there isn&#39;t anywhere to run to.&quot;

Ami yelled, &quot;Makoto please! Just run!&quot;

Trista smiled at Makoto, then said, &quot;Yes . . . yes, my fearless Senshi . 
. . run. Run, like the coward you truly are. Tell the others what you 
witness here today. Tell them how you were weak and unable to save the 
one you love.&quot;

Trista twirled her glaive dramatically, then held the weapon parallel to 
the ground, and ran straight at Ami, fully intending to . . .

Forgetting the tremendous pain she felt, Makoto let out an incoherent 
scream, then ran as fast as she could, getting in front of Ami before 
Trista did. She had just enough time to turn and face her fate.

Ami screamed, &quot;No! Makoto no!&quot;

There was a sharp, yet quick scream from Makoto as the blade plunged 
deep into her chest. For a moment, no one, not even Trista, moved. The 
only sound was Ami whimpering. To her, what she was witnessing was worse 
than if it had happened to herself.

Trista pushed the blade ever so slightly deeper, twisted it, then 
whispered to Makoto, &quot;Does it hurt? . . . yes . . . it does, doesn&#39;t it. 
Don&#39;t worry. It will all be over soon. Now, say goodbye to your lover.&quot;

Then she gave Makoto a violent kick to the stomach as she yanked her 
blade free, sending Makoto sprawling backward, landing at Ami&#39;s feet 
with a dull thud. Only then did the Sekkou restraining Ami release her.

The Sekkou suddenly forgotten, Ami knelt down beside Makoto. She pressed 
her hands over the wound, quieting the sucking sounds it made with every 
one of Makoto&#39;s breaths. In her heart, Ami knew there was nothing more 
to be done. Still, she had to try.

Ami looked into Makoto&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;Try not to talk. If . . . if we 
can get you away from here . . . we can use Saran Wrap to equalize the 
pressure in your lung . . . and then . . . and . . .once we get you to 
a. . . to a hospital . . . we could . . . we . . .&quot;

With her remaining strength, Makoto brought her hand up and cupped Ami&#39;s 
cheek gently. When she spoke, Makoto&#39;s voice gurgled almost as if 
underwater. &quot;Sorry . . . I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Sailor Mercury&#39;s voice hitched in her throat a moment when she noticed 
Makoto&#39;s teeth tinged pink with blood. The only thing worse than that, 
was how truly terrified the look in Makoto&#39;s eyes was.

Ami cradled Makoto&#39;s head, cooing, &quot;Makoto . . . It&#39;s . . . ok . . . 
It&#39;s ok.&quot;

Makoto rasped, &quot;Ami I lo . . . I . . . love . . . I . . . ve . . .&quot; Her 
jaw spasmed weakly a few more times, but no sound came out. Then, she 
seized violently, almost throwing Ami off of her in the process.

After a few more moments, Makoto&#39;s body relaxed, and her head became 
heavy. Her jaw spasmed once more . . . then again . . .and then her eyes 
were still open . . .

But she was gone.
