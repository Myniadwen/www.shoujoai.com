<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/poppy_chan.html">Poppy Chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Rei-Chan! Rei-Chan! Wait up!&quot; Usagi desperately called to a quickly moving 
raven haired girl.

&quot;Usagi?&quot; Rei asked, shocked. She stopped abruptly and turned around, 
catching the blonde in her arms as she collided with her. For a spilt second 
Rei found herself holding the warm bundle that was Usagi. A faint blush 
crept up her cheeks as she stepped back, her hands still on Usagi&#39;s 
shoulders, steadying her.

&quot;Where...is...everyone?&quot; Usagi asked out of breath.

&quot;Didn&#39;t you know? We called ahead to the movie theaters while we were 
waiting for you and found out they already sold out of tickets. I thought 
that Minako had called and told you already.&quot; Rei explained.

&quot;No. I was a little late...&quot;

&quot;A little?&quot; Rei interrupted.

&quot;I...was really late, and I ran all the way to your temple just as I saw you 
leaving. I&#39;ve been trying to catch up with you since! You move fast!&quot; Usagi 
exclaimed, still out of breath.

The sailor scouts had been planning to see the new Sailor V movie which was 
premiering that night. None of them had expected it to be sold out already. 
Minako had been crushed. They all decided to see it another night and went 
home to do some much needed studying, except Rei.

When Rei realized her hands were still on Usagi&#39;s shoulders she turned 
around and started walking again, but at a slower pace for Usagi. Usagi 
finally slowed her breathing and asked Rei where she was going.

&quot;The park.&quot; Rei said simply.

&quot;Mind if I come too?&quot; Usagi asked, looking up at Rei with puppy dog eyes. 
Rei hesitated for a moment.

&quot;Umm...sure.&quot; Rei loved Usagi&#39;s company, but she didn&#39;t know if she could 
explain the reason why she was going to the park.

&quot;You know, the sun&#39;s about to set.&quot; Usagi pointed out.

&quot;That&#39;s why I was hurrying odango head! Come on, pick up the pace!&quot; Rei 
ordered, and went into a fast jog. Usagi grumbled, but followed faithfully 
beside her, where she couldn&#39;t see the happy smile on Rei&#39;s face.

Once they got to the park Rei still didn&#39;t slow her pace. She walked down a 
curved path that lead to the back end of the park. They passed by laughing 
children and happy yet watchful mothers enjoying the last bit of sunlight 
before they headed home. They passed swings and slides which Usagi eyed 
longingly but still followed behind Rei. Crossing onto a dirt trail they 
made there way to a beautiful patch of cherry blossoms. The full bloom 
cherry blossom trees took away any feeling of isolation in the empty side of 
the park.

In the center of the cherry blossom trees stood the most beautiful water 
fountain Usagi had ever seen. It was made from stone the same cream color of 
the moon. A tall column stood in the center of the fountains bowl where two 
statue figures were perched. They were two lovers locked in a passionate 
embrace. Water flowed upwards at their feet and poured down all the sides of 
the column. Usagi was breathless.

&quot;Rei-Chan...its...so...!&quot; Usagi gushed out, unable to finish her sentence. 
Rei smiled happily, not looking at the fountain but fixated on the beautiful 
princess.

&quot;I know.&quot; She said quietly, understanding how it felt to see the work of art 
for the first time.

Not as beautiful as you though, Rei desperately wished to say. Instead she 
remarked, &quot;There&#39;s a legend that says if you come to this fountain as the 
sun sets and make a wish it will come true.&quot;

&quot;Wow? Really?&quot; Usagi excitedly asked.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Very slowly Rei clasped her hands in front of her and bowed her head 
in silent prayer. After a moment she looked up and found ocean eyes staring 
at her.

&quot;Rei-Chan, you must have a very important wish!&quot; Usagi exclaimed.

&quot;More than you know, Usagi.&quot; Rei responded quietly. Usagi pondered over this 
for a moment.

&quot;Okay than! My wish will be that Rei-Chan gets her important wish!&quot; Usagi 
said happily and brought her hands up in prayer. As soon as she repeated the 
wish in her mind she looked up to see Rei&#39;s eyes sparkling.

&quot;Usagi, you just lost a wish of your own.&quot; Rei said.

&quot;No! I really want your wish to come true. It&#39;s important, right?&quot; Usagi 
asked sincerely. Rei smiled and gently clasped her hand. Usagi sighed for a 
moment as she felt Rei&#39;s warmth travel through her. Rei gently tugged her 
hand and Usagi followed her. The silent priestess walked her over to the 
front of the fountain and looked up, reluctantly letting go of Usagi&#39;s hand. 
Usagi looked up and saw a break in the cherry trees. The opening in the 
trees gave them a spectacular view of the sun setting. The sky blazed 
several colors, and after a few minuets unified and turned a beautiful shade 
of pale pink.

&quot;Wow, its hard to tell the difference between the sky and the cherry 
blossoms!&quot; Usagi exclaimed, enchanted by the sky. Rei was enjoying the sun 
set also, but she enjoyed sneaking peaks at the beautiful princess even 
more. Usagi slowly became aware that her elegant companion kept glancing 
over at her. Usagi only hoped that Rei couldn&#39;t see the blush creeping up 
her cheeks. Rei had eyes like fire, and they made Usagi shiver with 
something she was too afraid to place...

&quot;Rei, what was your wish?&quot; Usagi couldn&#39;t help but ask. Rei studied Usagi, 
who looked like a desperately curious kitten. She smiled.

&quot;If I tell you it might not come true.&quot; Rei answered. Usagi let out a huge 
gasp.

&quot;Oh no! I told you what I wished for! Now my wish won&#39;t help yours!&quot; Usagi 
exclaimed, looking like she was about to cry.

&quot;You meant it from the bottom of your heart, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll still count.&quot; 
Rei whispered, looking at her for a moment, then turned away. She was too 
afraid she&#39;d be lost in Usagi&#39;s ocean eyes.

&quot;Hmm...could I guess your wish?&quot; Usagi asked, her curious kitten side 
returning. She had an evil grin on her face. Rei&#39;s logical side told her no, 
but it was more complicated than that. Deep down she wanted Usagi to know 
her secret, and at that moment her emotions won out.

&quot;Yes. But I doubt you&#39;ll be able to guess.&quot; Rei found herself saying. Usagi 
sat and thought for a moment.

&quot;Hmm...does it have to do with love?&quot; Usagi asked. Rei sat for a moment, all 
her emotions ragging against the other, yet again she went against her best 
judgment.

&quot;Yes.&quot; she said quietly. Usagi thought again. Her eyes closed in 
concentration and her nose scrunched up a bit. Rei giggled. Usagi ignored 
her and thought even harder.

Usagi, please, can&#39;t you guess? So long, I&#39;ve wished so long.

&quot;Rei-Chan is in love with someone, someone special. If you weren&#39;t you 
wouldn&#39;t come all the way out here!&quot; Usagi said, extremely proud of her 
deduction.

Instead of telling her if it was true or not Rei asked, &quot;Why have you been 
calling me Rei-Chan lately?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I dunno. It&#39;s cute. If you don&#39;t like it I can stop using it.&quot; Usagi 
said a bit unhappily.

&quot;No.&quot; Rei said quickly. &quot;I like it.&quot;

&quot;Your avoiding my questions, so I&#39;m going to guess that Rei-Chan does love 
someone important. Hmm...now who could it be?&quot; Usagi went back into deep 
thought.

&quot;Usagi...&quot; Rei began, but held back. Love is a tender thing. How does one 
confess a love that they&#39;ve held back for so long? Especially when that love 
is what keeps them from such painful loneliness. Even if she never found 
out, Rei could live off Usagi&#39;s smiles for the rest of her life.

&quot;Yes Rei?&quot; Usagi asked, gently pushing her dear friend to go on.

&quot;Those two statues, the people, the, the lovers.&quot; She stammered, barely able 
to speak over the furious pounding of her heart. &quot;They, they aren&#39;t a man 
and a woman you know. Its pretty much impossible to tell because they&#39;re so 
close to each other, but actually the statue is of two woman kissing. Hardly 
any people know that. In fact, no one even knows how this statue got here, 
or who built it. The only thing known was...that...they were women. And the 
legend about making wishes at sunset.&quot; Rei was stumbling all over her words. 
She barely was able to choke out her next question.

&quot;Usagi...how do...you...feel about women having relationships?&quot; she managed 
to blurt out, turning her head away so the blonde couldn&#39;t see her deep 
blush.

&quot;I think that when two people fall in love its the most beautiful thing that 
could ever happen. Doesn&#39;t matter who it is. Love is love.&quot; Usagi said 
simply, smiling another sunshine smile. Rei smiled, but it faded. Her logic 
was coming into gear again and it was screaming at her that Usagi would 
never love her like that.

&quot;Usagi, don&#39;t bother to guess my wish. It&#39;ll never come true.&quot; Rei said 
solemnly.

&quot;But Rei-Chan, its important to you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Usagi asked, startled at the 
priestesses mood swing.

&quot;It&#39;s the dearest wish I&#39;ve ever had Usagi. But...an impossible wish is 
nothing more than that.&quot; Rei said, crystal tears trailing down her smooth 
cheeks. Usagi began to tear up herself, but managed to fish out her 
handkerchief from her pocket to gently wipe away Rei&#39;s tears.

&quot;Rei, please don&#39;t say anything like that! Wishes are special! Even if they 
seem impossible, that makes them all the more important!&quot; Usagi insisted, 
clear eyes sparkling with fresh tears and hope.

&quot;Rei...what&#39;s your wish?&quot; Usagi asked, her voice lowering to the softness of 
a purr. Rei looked up then, her eyes meeting stormy blue ones. Rei&#39;s eyes 
were liquid pools of ebony, filled with so many tears, yet something so 
beautiful behind them. There was loneliness in Rei&#39;s heart, an unrequited 
love, and her love for that person was so strong it burned.

Usagi looked deeper and saw a clear reflection of herself in Rei&#39;s eyes. 
Suddenly she realized who Rei loved.

&quot;Rei...&quot; Usagi gasped, blinking. Rei&#39;s head dropped down, knowing that she 
had just lost the most important friend she&#39;d ever had. Usagi would reject 
her now, and loneliness would consume her heart.

&quot;You wish for me?&quot; Usagi asked in amazement. Rei felt her emotions crash 
around her as she waited for Usagi to leave.

Suddenly the sky turned a magnificent red, ablaze with love&#39;s desire. A 
strong, fragrant wind blew around the girls, stirring up a wave of cherry 
blossom that encircled them. Ebony eyes raised in hope. The serene princess 
slowly leaned in, her arms instinctively going around the priestess. Their 
eyes meet for the briefest moment, conveying feelings that words never 
could. Usagi leaned in, and pink frosted lips meet full cherry ones.

Usagi felt the depth of Rei&#39;s passion, the waiting, the longing. How many 
times Rei had wanted to tell her, all the time she spent dreaming of it, and 
the amazement that it was suddenly happening. Rei felt pure light shinning 
though her, and knew deep inside it was Usagi&#39;s pure heart that was slowly 
cleansing her of all the pain and loneliness in her life. This was better 
than any wish she could have prayed for. This was real, true love, and no 
one would ever be able to take that away.

The last bit of sunlight faded over the horizon. Nighttime and starlight 
surrounded the girls, and a full moon shone down to upon their joined 
figures. Usagi nestled into Rei&#39;s arms, having no intention to leave them. 
Rei wrapped her arms around the girl and buried her face into silken blonde 
hair. For the longest time they sat just like that, listening to the flowing 
water of the lovers fountain and the beating of each others hearts.

&quot;Rei-Chan, I like your wish.&quot; Usagi said playfully, and Rei held her closer.
