<h1>Inner Crisis, Outer Conflict (part 2 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/innerouter-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Usagi entered Rei&#39;s room and looked around her with surprise. While it 
was no surprise to see her close friends gathered there, the looks 
which greeted her were so solemn that she immediately began to worry. 
Greetings were short and to the point.

&quot;Did you guys receive Setsuna&#39;s message too?&quot; She was answered by 
short nods from all her friends. &quot;I wonder what its about?&quot; 

Rei cocked her head towards the door. &quot;We&#39;re about to find out.&quot; 

The door slid aside and two figures entered. Usagi looked up and 
gasped with shock. Setsuna looked grim, indeed, but Michiru looked so 
bad that it had taken Usagi a moment to recognize her. She looked as 
if she had aged many years. Her face was drawn and grey, her body 
hunched as if a great weight had settled itself on her shoulders. 
Usagi could feel her eyes filling with tears at the sight of her 
friend&#39;s obvious pain. 

Makoto and Rei had jumped up to support Michiru. They led her to a 
position at the table in the middle of the room. 

Minako looked around, then asked, &quot;Where&#39;s Haruka? Is she with you?&quot; 

Setsuna shook her head abruptly. &quot;That is why I called you here. 
Haruka is gone.&quot; 

&quot;Gone?!?&quot; they all cried. 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ami asked softy. 

&quot;I mean,&quot; Setsuna gripped Michiru&#39;s hand tightly, &quot;that Haruka has 
left and we don&#39;t know where she is.&quot; Michiru swallowed a sob, trying 
to keep herself under control. Usagi&#39;s heart wrenched at the sound, 
and she could see that the others felt the same way. 

&quot;Can&#39;t you use your mirror?&quot; Makoto asked Michiru. &quot;To find out where 
she is?&quot; 

The other girls nodded with relief at the suggestion. 

Michiru shook her head. &quot;She&#39;s taken it with her.&quot; 

********** 

Neptune took the bow out of her hair and sat down on the bed. She 
looked over to Uranus, who stood in the window looking out at the 
night sky. Now that she was close to Uranus, Neptune could admire up 
close the noble mien, the strength, the graceful hands that she had 
seen time and time again in her mirror. She waited in silence and 
darkness until the silhouetted figure turned to her. 

&quot;I&#39;ve been watching you for so long.&quot; Neptune spoke into the darkness 
of the room. &quot;I didn&#39;t know if we would ever meet.&quot; 

Uranus stepped forward and Neptune moved to meet her. They kissed 
again, lips parting, tongues meeting. Uranus held Neptune&#39;s face in 
her hands, then ran them through her hair. She held the freed hair to 
her face and inhaled its scent. 

&quot;You smell beautiful.&quot; Uranus&#39;s voice was thick with desire. It sent a 
thrill down Neptune&#39;s spine. She lifted her face once more to feel 
lips, cool and soft, meet her own. When they broke apart, Neptune 
kissed the throat in front of her, tracing a trail to the top the 
uniform coat&#39;s stiff collar. Her hands lay on the front of the coat 
and she laid her head briefly on Uranus&#39;s chest. 

Uranus stepped back and unfastened the collar, then the frogging 
beneath it. She removed the coat, and laid it aside. Clad now in shirt 
and breeches, she moved back into Neptune&#39;s embrace. 

Sensations that she had never felt, alone on her planet, now flooded 
her mind. Uranus let her hands take in the several softnesses of 
Neptune. Hair, skin, lips, all were cataloged for later memory. Her 
fingers found the fasteners of Neptune&#39;s dress and began to open them. 
When the dress was loosened, it was Neptune&#39;s turn to step back. The 
dress slid down to the floor and was immediately forgotten. 

Neptune untied Uranus&#39;s collar, and peeled apart her shirt. Uranus&#39;s 
skin shone lightly in the moonglow from the window. Neptune buried her 
face into the hollow of Uranus&#39;s neck. When at last a moan forced its 
way from deep within Uranus&#39;s throat, Neptune sighed with pleasure. 
She stripped the shirt from Uranus and kissed her way down to her 
breasts. Uranus laid back on the bed, while her hands roamed Neptune&#39;s 
body, feeling curves and hollows, hair and skin. When she drew Neptune 
upwards again for a kiss, her own body cried out for her new lover. 

Uranus crawled her way down Neptune&#39;s body, tasting her, running her 
hands and lips across breasts, stomach and legs. She felt the warmth 
emanating from Neptune&#39;s center, and it called to her. With a small 
cry, Neptune let her head roll back as she felt first tongue, then 
fingers enter her, move in her. She could not have stopped the build 
up of passion if she had wanted to. Hissing Uranus&#39;s name, she tensed, 
then released her tension in a burst of movement and breath. She lay 
for a moment, dazed by the feelings that chased around her mind and 
body. 

Desire won out, the need to feel this woman around her. Neptune drew 
Uranus up and kissed her fiercely, licking her own wetness from 
Uranus&#39;s lips. Uranus growled with desire, and Neptune raked her nails 
along Uranus&#39;s back. 

The blonde moved her body over the smaller woman&#39;s, planting herself 
in between Neptune&#39;s legs. Uranus&#39; lips found Neptune&#39;s breasts and 
she began devouring them, pressing her body hard into Neptune&#39;s. 
Neptune gripped Uranus&#39;s shoulders hard, digging nails into the 
muscular body above her. Moaning, Neptune thrust back into Uranus. 

As the tempo increased, Neptune flipped herself over and now sitting 
upon Uranus, continued the movement. Uranus found herself neatly 
pinned to the bed, with Neptune in control. Uranus smiled, but then as 
quickly threw her head back as fingers found her center and brought 
her almost as quickly to the edge of orgasm. 

With a yelp, Uranus protested the disappearance of the fingers. With a 
different yell she acknowledged them again, inside of her. She felt 
herself cry Neptune&#39;s name out loud as she peaked and again, more 
softly, as she relaxed. Uranus laid her hand against her face and was 
amazed to feel it come away wet. Soft tears formed in the corners of 
her eyes, as she lay back, pulling Neptune to her. 

Later, they lay sleeping, blonde and green hair intertwined, in the 
silence of the Silver Millenium night.
