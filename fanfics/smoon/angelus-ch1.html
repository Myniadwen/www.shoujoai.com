<h1>Angelus Errarae</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Minako is a private crier. Silently, in the dark, cool, calm of her 
bedroom, she weeps for love unrequited, for the loss of childhood. 
 
She, the soldier who rules over the power of love and emotion, cannot 
find it in her to cry in front of her friends. Occasionally, Usagi gives 
her knowing looks, and she pats Minako&#146;s shoulder before she goes over 
to Rei.
 
Always Rei. Even through the petty fights, the bickering, Minako can 
almost see the love there, hidden beneath yelling and battling. The 
obvious wanting is so obvious, that she has to turn away. Other times, 
she sees them smile at each other, and Usagi is even so bold to drape 
her arm over Rei&#146;s shoulder, lean in close when she thinks she is not 
noticed.
 
Only Minako notices.
 
&#147;Shut up Usagi!&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re so mean Rei!&#148;
 
She loves them both, and they love each other. It was truly a love not 
returned.
 
For a while, Minako floats in between the realm of life and death, 
almost wanting to let go, but not quite willing to give up.
 
Pathetic.
 
She laughs when it seems fitting, and she always smiles.
 
Inside she is dying.
 
As long as no one knows, it&#146;s fine.
 
It&#146;ll be alright, as long as they think it&#146;s ok.
 
She wishes they would either choose each other, or that one of them 
would choose her.
 
She waits, and on lonely nights, she cries herself to sleep.
 
She is in Angelus Errarae.
 
Where even angels lose their way.
