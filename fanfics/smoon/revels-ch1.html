<h1>Revelations</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hi minna-san! ^-^ This takes place a while after &#145;Sudden Glimpse&#146;. ^-^ This was the 
first story that we&#146;ve written with Gabi (psychokittensenshi), the newest member of the 
Amazoness Quartet.  She&#146;s a great author and she&#146;s a great addition to the Quartet. ^-^

Well, if you have anytime after reading the story, we&#146;d love to hear from you. Actually, 
we could use your help, too. For a while now we&#146;ve been using lover&#146;s nicknames that 
both Hotaru &amp; ChibiUsa use for each other like Taru-chan for Hotaru and Odango-chan 
for ChibiUsa. We really liked Taru-chan, but its been used so much lately by just about 
everybody besides ChibiUsa in fanfics lately (including by Mamoru in a Hotaru and 
Mamoru fic-_-). So we&#146;re going to keep using it, but its lost its meaning as a lover&#146;s 
nickname for ChibiUsa to call her. We need your help to come up with a new lover&#146;s 
nickname for Hotaru. If you can think of anything, please e-mail us. ^^ Thank you, 
everyone. ^-^

	Minako, Ami, Usagi, Rei, and Makoto walked along as soon as classes had 
finished. The four girls talked happily, glad that it was finally the weekend, a chance for 
them to relax. A crowd of students passed by them, blocking the car that had just pulled 
up from their view. The door to the car opened and a woman stepped out, scanning the 
sea of students in an attempt to locate a specific girl. &quot;Minako!&quot; she yelled, finally 
spotting her. &quot;Minako, over here!&quot;
	Minako slowed when she heard a voice calling her name. The other four girls 
stopped as well when they heard. Minako looked around, trying to find the person 
calling her name. She saw the lady standing by a car, waving her over. Minako froze 
when she realized the woman was here to pick her up. &quot;I&#39;ll see the rest of you later,&quot; she 
said quickly. &quot;We&#39;ll talk this weekend. I&#39;ve gotta get going.&quot; Minako waved and hurried 
to the car.
	&quot;Isn&#39;t that Natsuna?&quot; Makoto asked.
	&quot;Yep,&quot; Usagi answered. &quot;She&#39;s Minako&#39;s girlfriend.&quot; She giggled as she 
watched Minako get into the car with the older woman. &quot;Couldn&#39;t Minako have started 
going out with her back when we had Haruna for a teacher? Natsuna is Haruna&#39;s little 
sister, so maybe I could have gotten through her class easier.&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t think Minako going out with her sister would have made any difference 
in how hard Haruna was on you,&quot; Ami commented.
	&quot;Probably not,&quot; Makoto agreed. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe she&#39;s going out with a 
twenty-eight year old woman.&quot;
	&quot;Why, you jealous?&quot; Rei asked teasingly.
	Makoto laughed. &quot;No. Why would I be? I&#39;ve got Ami.&quot;
	Ami blushed when Makoto mentioned her.
	Rei just sighed darkly. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true.&quot;
	&quot;Rei, are you okay?&quot; Usagi asked her.
	&quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m tired, though. I should be getting back to the shrine. I&#39;ll see you 
all tomorrow.&quot;
	&quot;Bye, Rei!&quot; Usagi said as Rei began walking home.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Minako rolled down the window to get some air as the car pulled away.
	&quot;So how was your day?&quot; Natsuna asked.
	&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Minako answered. &quot;It was long, though.&quot;
	Natsuna laughed. &quot;You would probably think that since its Friday and all. You 
just couldn&#39;t wait to get out of there.&quot;
	Minako smiled at her. &quot;Yeah, pretty much. How was yours?&quot;
	&quot;Not bad,&quot; Natsuna replied. &quot;Nothing as exciting as in the life of Sailor V.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not Sailor V anymore, remember?&quot; Minako corrected her.
	&quot;I know. But you made a much better Sailor V than Sailor Venus,&quot; Natsuna 
said. Minako giggled. Natsuna still had Sailor V memorabilia around their shared 
apartment. It still surprised Minako when she saw them. She&#39;d tried to get Natsuna to 
take them down, but the older woman wouldn&#39;t listen to her.
	&quot;Do you have any work you had to take home?&quot; Minako asked.
	&quot;Nope. I left Wakagi to handle the rest of it. I didn&#39;t want any distractions once 
we got home.&quot; Natsuna winked seductively at Minako.
	Minako felt her blood boiling when she felt Natsuna&#39;s hand rest on her thigh. 
She&#39;d never thought that the other woman could do this to her. She&#39;d just thought that 
the police chief was strange back when she was Sailor V. &quot;How could you have put up 
with me for so long? Ever since I was thirteen, when I first became Sailor V.&quot;
	&quot;Patience,&quot; Natsuna said. &quot;A lot of patience. It was really hard to get you to 
take me seriously about being in love with you. But in the end, it looks like my patience 
paid off.&quot;
	&quot;I love you, Natsuna,&quot; Minako said happily.
	&quot;I love you, too.&quot; Natsuna leaned in and kissed her.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Usagi, Ami, and Makoto walked together, talking about the day&#39;s events.
	&quot;Are you and Mamoru going out tonight?&quot; Makoto asked Usagi.
	&quot;No. He&#39;s busy tonight studying with Motoki. What about you two? Are you and 
Ami-chan going out tonight?&quot; Usagi asked mischievously, knowing how nervous Ami 
was about the whole thing.
	Ami blushed a deep crimson and Makoto tried to answer. &quot;Umm...Well, 
kinda..&quot; Ami only nodded.
	Usagi laughed. &quot;You guys are so cute together.&quot;
	&quot;Thanks, Usagi-chan,&quot; Ami managed.
	&quot;We should probably get going,&quot; Makoto said after checking her watch
	&quot;Yeah. We&#39;ll talk to you later, Usagi-chan,&quot; Ami said.
	The three girls said their goodbyes before heading off.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	When Rei got back home to the Hikawa Jinga she headed straight back to her 
room and changed into her Miko robes. She was depressed about things lately. It seemed 
like everyone had been finding love. Everyone except her.  Her love life was in 
shambles. Yuuchiro had finally left several months ago, tired of waiting for her.
	Rei sat down in front of the Sacred Flame. She tried to relax before meditating. 
She wanted to see if she could find out if she&#39;d ever find love. She started to drift off, her 
mind floating in a sea of images. After what seemed like an eternity, things started to 
coalesce.
 	But it had to be wrong. She was seeing the Silver Millennium. She wanted to 
see the future, not the past. Jaedite? Was that it? Could that be why she was seeing the 
past? No, she knew it wasn&#39;t him. There had to be someone else.
	Then she saw her. She was standing in the shadows on a balcony, the earth 
hanging in the sky. Suddenly the figure turned around towards Rei. She gasped. It was 
Princess Serenity. Rei knew she had some unresolved feelings for Usagi, but she knew 
that anything between them was impossible. Usagi already had the prince she was 
destined to be with.
	Memories came flooding back to Rei as the images from the Silver Millennium 
surrounded her. Serenity&#39;s four Inner Senshi had had Endymion&#39;s four generals as 
boyfriends at the time. But Rei and another of the Inner Senshi had longed for Serenity. 
&#39;Who was the other one in love with Serenity?&#39; Rei asked herself. Her memories of the 
Silver Millennium still weren&#39;t complete so she had difficulty recalling who it was. 
&#39;Minako? That&#39;s right. We both fought over Serenity, even though neither of us ever 
worked up the courage to tell her how we felt. Minako was going through a lot back 
then. She was torn about how she felt about Serenity and her feelings for Kunzite. And 
that&#39;s exactly why I thought that I should have been with Usagi. Minako told me she 
loved both of them. I liked Jaedite and all, but it wasn&#39;t the same as how I felt for 
Serenity. Neither of us stood a chance against Endymion, though. He had destiny on his 
side. At least Minako seems to have gotten over it. She has Natsuna now. I still cling on. 
I&#146;m friends with Usagi&#146;s daughter, yet I still cling on. I can&#39;t find love because I can&#39;t 
bring myself to let go of her.&#39;
	Suddenly, everything changed. Rei tried to make out where she was as she 
waited for the images to clarify. After a few moments, she realized that this had to be 
Crystal Tokyo. She&#39;d only been there once before, when they&#39;d gone to the future to help 
ChibiUsa save her parents. Rei saw a lavishly decorated bedroom, most likely the 
Queen&#39;s room. She could see Usagi dressed in her royal gown as Neo Queen Serenity. 
She was laughing happily. Rei sighed. She was so beautiful. Someone else was there 
with Serenity. The two were talking about something Rei couldn&#39;t make out. She tried to 
tell who the other person was, but the details weren&#39;t clear enough yet. The image slowly 
became clearer and Rei could finally tell that the other person sitting with Serenity was 
her. &#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39; Rei thought. Serenity leaned towards Rei&#39;s future self and the 
two kissed passionately. Rei couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing. &#39;But how?&#39; Rei asked, 
trying desperately to come up with an answer as the images dissolved around her.
	Rei sat in shock as she came out of her meditative trance. What she&#39;d seen had 
been her dream come true, but she knew it couldn&#39;t happen. Was it just wishful thinking 
on her part or did she actually end up with Usagi? Rei tried to meditate on an answer, 
but after what she&#39;d seen, she couldn&#39;t calm herself enough to try. She sighed heavily 
and decided to give up for the time being. She resolved to try again later, hopefully
with better results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hotaru was sitting on a decorative stone throne set atop some large steps. 
ChibiMoon was at the bottom of the steps, unconscious on an altar. Energy snaked out 
from Hotaru, forming a hand at the end. It headed out towards ChibiMoon and slammed 
down on her chest. The younger girl let out a scream of pain as she was dragged back to 
consciousness.
	&quot;Hotaru-chan... I&#39;m glad to see you...&quot; ChibiMoon managed before passing out 
again, her Heart Crystal pulled from her body. Hotaru felt a surge of terror run through 
her as the pink haired girl lay deathly still.
	ChibiMoon&#39;s Heart Crystal flew up to where Hotaru was sitting. After 
swallowing it, she changed completely into Mistress 9. The Senshi looked on, unable to 
stop her as Sailormoon talked futilely with Professor Tomoe.
	&#39;Even when I was Mistress 9, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about ChibiUsa. 
Whatever part of me was still there was so worried about what had happened to her. Its 
so life-like. I&#39;ve had this dream before. And I&#39;ve talked to ChibiUsa about it a couple 
times, too. She always tells me that it wasn&#39;t my fault, that it wasn&#39;t me who did those 
awful things, like killing Kaolinite and hurting my Odango-chan. It always hurts as it 
all comes back to me, everything I did as Mistress 9, and I cry. And ChibiUsa holds me, 
trying to stop the pain I feel. But she&#39;s not here tonight. I have to deal with the dream on 
my own. I know it was just that, a dream, but what happened was real. I lie here for a 
while, uncertain of what to do. I want to hear her voice. I want too hear her tell me 
everything&#39;s all right. I want her to hold me. I think about calling her, but she&#39;s probably 
asleep now. She&#146;s spending the night at Momoko&#146;s house.  I could call anyway, even if 
it does wake her up, but I&#39;m uncertain. I feel so nervous and scared, alone in the dark. I 
don&#39;t know what to do. I know I can&#39;t get back to sleep. I never can after I have that 
dream.&#39; Hotaru sat up in bed, hugging her knees to her chest. After a couple minutes, 
she stood up and headed for the door of her room. &#39;I want to see her,&#39; she thought.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Setsuna put down the book she was reading when she heard the front door 
open. She looked out her window to see Hotaru hurrying off to find ChibiUsa. &quot;I hope 
she&#39;s okay,&quot; Setsuna said aloud. &#39;No one could be happier than I am that Hotaru and 
ChibiUsa are in love. I raised Hotaru like a daughter with Michiru and Haruka. I feel 
like Hotaru&#39;s my own daughter, and in an odd way, I feel the same way about Small 
Lady. I got to watch her grow up in the future. She came to the Time Palace so often, 
even though she wasn&#39;t supposed to. She came to me with her problems when she 
needed help. And I actually helped raise Hotaru. I guess the main difference is that one 
of them calls me mama and the other doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m glad they have each other. They both 
mean so much to me.&#39;
	&#39;I do admit that being around Haruka and Michiru and a love stricken Hotaru 
does get a bit depressing sometimes. Its just hard to see people so in love like that and to 
not have anyone of my own to love. And everyone I have fallen for winds up destined to 
be with someone else.&#39; Setsuna sighed. &#39;First Endymion and then Michiru. I practically 
grew up with Michiru and Haruka back in the Silver Millennium. Michiru was my best 
friend since we were young. It took a while for me to realize I loved her. I was so down 
after Endymion got with Princess Serenity, but she helped me get through it. I felt 
differently towards her after that. I wanted to tell her, but Haruka was too fast for me. 
Before I could do anything, she was already with Haruka. Why does destiny always pass 
me over?&#39; Setsuna picked up her book again and tried to stop thinking about it. &#39;I 
shouldn&#39;t lose any sleep over it, I guess.&#39; She looked out the window again. &#39;Wherever 
you are, be careful, Hotaru.&#39;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Yaten walked hesitantly out of her room in a shimmering light blue dress. It 
accentuated her soft curves perfectly, fitting the short girl almost like a second skin. Her 
hair was up in a high pony tail that trailed down to the small of her back.
	Taiki looked up from the book she was reading and arched an eyebrow. 
&quot;That&#39;s... interesting,&quot; Taiki said, struggling for the right words. She hadn&#39;t seen Yaten 
in a dress since they&#39;d all been back on Kinmoku, before they&#39;d come to earth disguised 
as the Three Lights.
	Seiya looked over at Yaten from where she was sitting after she heard Taiki. It 
had been so quiet for a while that the sudden noise had startled her. She stared in shock 
for a few seconds at Yaten. &quot;Why are you wearing that?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m going out,&quot; Yaten said defensively. They had been dressing up as guys for 
so long that it seemed odd to be in a dress again. Yaten felt herself relaxing as she got 
used to it. Kakyuu had asked her to wear a dress a couple of nights ago when they&#39;d 
decided to go out for the night. It had seemed an odd request at first. Kakyuu had grown 
up with Yaten as a girl. Kakyuu found it strange to have her Starlights pretending to be 
men. Yaten felt more comfortable dressing in women&#39;s clothes anyway, so they went 
shopping later that day. Yaten was nervous about what Seiya and Taiki would think, 
though she kept telling herself it didn&#39;t matter. They were like sisters to her, so she still 
felt anxiety wash over her as they continued to stare at her.
	&quot;But why are you going out in that?&quot; Seiya asked.
	&quot;Because she looks pretty in it.&quot; The Three Lights all turned as the heard their 
princess, Kakyuu. She was wearing a low cut black and red dress. Her red hair was done 
up in elegant braids. She smiled happily as she walked up beside Yaten.
	&quot;You can&#39;t go dressed like that,&quot; Seiya said as she turned back towards Yaten.
	&quot;Why can&#39;t I? I am a girl.&quot; Yaten could tell Seiya was getting frustrated. She 
knew that Seiya was in love with Kakyuu as well. To some extent all three of them loved 
her. But in the end, she&#39;d fallen in love with Yaten. Seiya was still a little jealous about 
that even though she wanted Kakyuu and her surrogate sister to be happy.
	&quot;It was your idea to masquerade as men in the first place,&quot; Seiya argued.
	&quot;Well, it was a stupid idea. We&#39;ve found Kakyuu. There&#39;s no reason to keep 
pretending anymore. And besides, I don&#39;t like pretending to be a man,&quot; Yaten told Seiya.
	Kakyuu giggled. &quot;If you two don&#39;t mind, Yaten and I have dinner reservations.&quot; 
She waved to Taiki and Seiya as she grabbed Yaten&#39;s hand and started walking to the 
door with her. &quot;We&#39;ll see you later!&quot; she said.
	Seiya sat down as the door closed behind the two. &quot;What do you think, Taiki?&quot;
	Taiki pulled her book back up in front of her. &quot;Yaten did have a point. There 
really isn&#39;t a reason for us to go around like this anymore. Besides for the fans. They all 
think the Three Lights are men, so it would be a shock to find out we aren&#39;t.&quot;
	Seiya sighed. &quot;You too, Taiki?&quot;
	Taiki just smiled slightly as she went back to her book.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Momoko sat with her legs crossed, Diana next to her with her head on her lap 
letting Momoko&#39;s hands pass through her cute double odangos and soft hair. She was 
enjoying the motions and attention. She loved being so close to Momoko, and being able 
to relax into her . Diana place her hand on Momoko&#39;s cheek, grabbing her attention. 
Momoko smiled and leaned into a kiss. Then she heard a knock at the door and was 
ripped from the pleasure. She looked up to her mother.
        &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked nervously.
        &quot;Honey, ChibiUsa is here to spend the night,&quot; she looked to the tiny gray kitten on 
her daughters lap. &quot;Well Diana sure has been spending quite a lot of time here hasn&#39;t 
she?&quot; The kitten meowed and rubbed up against Momoko&#39;s stomach. ChibiUsa appeared 
at the door and smiled.
        &quot;Konnichiwa Momo-chan&quot; she walked inside and plopped her baggage on the bed. 
Momoko&#39;s mother walked out and Diana returned to human form, and her place next  to 
Momoko. ChibiUsa smiled.
        &quot;Well it seems you two have grown closer doesn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked. &quot;Makes me wish 
I&#39;d asked Hotaru to come with me.&quot;
        &quot;Why didn&#39;t you ChibiUsa-chan?&quot; Momoko asked. ChibiUsa just smiled and 
shrugged her shoulders.  Just then there was a knock at Momoko&#39;s window and Momoko 
went to answer it quickly.
        &quot;Hotaru!&quot; Momoko said. The tired raven-haired girl looking at her not answering. 
She turned to ChibiUsa, still trying to catch her breath.
        &quot;I need to speak with you, odango,&quot; she said desperately.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Makoto walked a little ways into the kitchen seeing Ami at the table with her books 
sprawled around her. Makoto walked a little further and pulled Ami into her arms 
planting a gentle kiss on her mouth. Ami voiced a slight groan of surprise. Makoto just 
smiled internally, reaching deeper into the kiss. Ami turned and let Makoto grab her 
into a warm embrace.
        &quot;I&#39;m so happy to have you with me, Ami-chan,&quot; Makoto said kissing Ami again 
and pulling her into the next room.
        &quot;But I have to study Mako-chan.&quot; Ami began to protest.
        &quot;This won&#39;t take long Ami-chan trust me.&quot; Ami was going to protest but felt 
Makoto&#39;s long fingers unbuttoning the white professional shirt she had on.  Makoto 
pulled it away with expert hands and reaching behind to unclasp the bra strap. When 
she had the offending clothing away from her she knew Ami wouldn&#39;t protest any 
longer. Makoto kissed her again and pulled off her shirt and skirt as well leaving them 
on the floor next to her. She laid Ami on the couch and placed Ami&#39;s hands on her 
breasts, sighing at the cooling affect they had on her warm skin. Ami smiled and 
wiggled out of the pants and undies she had left on and felt the warmth of her lover&#39;s 
own naked body pulling her into a sitting up stance. Holding the body as close to her as 
possible, and feeling her lover&#39;s body tense at the anticipation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Natsuna...&quot; Minako sighed feeling her lover holding her from behind in the warn 
bath water. The soapy water seeped into every pore. Natsuna smiled and cupped 
Minako&#39;s breasts, her fingers running over the entire delicate surface. She whispered a 
sweet comment and made Minako relax even more. Minako in turn ran her finger across 
the inner thighs of her lover, teasing her slightly. Natsuna knew it would come in it&#39;s 
own time. The wait was all the thrill, wondering what new feeling that her lover would 
drench out of her this time. Minako turned facing Natsuna and placing her fingers in 
between Natsuna&#39;s legs.
        &quot;I love you,&quot; Minako said  kissing Natsuna deeply pushing her back into the bath 
until Natsuna was totally relaxed against the cold tile behind her. She smiled and 
knew....this was it. Natsuna was all that she wanted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Rei walked down the street to the apartment Usagi and Mamoru shared 
knocking on the door. She waited for an answer. When Usagi showed up sooner than 
she&#146;d expected, felt flustered. She shifted slightly and was for once without a quick 
sarcastic remark.
	&quot;Usagi-chan, may I come in?&quot; she asked. Usagi smiled and moved so that Rei 
could enter.
	&quot;Rei-chan it&#39;s so nice that you could come,&quot; Usagi said loudly and then drew 
closer so that she could speak to Rei privately. &quot;Rei there&#39;s something that I have to tell 
you...&quot; But before Usagi could finish a male presence entered the room.
              &quot;Rei, so nice to see you again,&quot; Mamoru&#39;s voice stabbed into Rei&#39;s mind. She 
grew angry and then clamed. She couldn&#146;t show up destiny, Mamoru always got his 
princess. She could never have Usagi. And with that she left to the door and the cold. 
Usagi ran after her.
              &quot;Rei-chan wait! You don&#39;t have to leave!&quot;  she said trying to stop her friend.
              &quot;Yes, I do. Usagi-chan, I have to go.&quot;
              &quot;But why? It&#39;s just Mamoru and me.&quot;
              &quot;Usagi you dot understand. It&#39;s because of Mamoru.&quot;
              &quot;But...why?&quot;
              &quot;You won&#39;t understand. Just forget it.&quot;
              &quot;No. what&#39;s wrong, Rei-chan. Why is it Mamoru&#39;s fault?&quot; Usagi asked.
&#145;             &#145;Because I love you,&#146; Rei thought. &#145;Because I can&#39;t stand him being able to hold 
you and I can&#39;t...&#39; Rei stopped herself and spun on her heel. Getting ready to leave.
	&quot;Rei-chan, why can&#39;t you tell me what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Usagi asked worriedly.
	&quot;Would you come in, Rei?&quot; Mamoru asked, worried as well. &quot;I could make 
some tea.&quot;
	Rei sighed. This was all so hard for her to deal with. Why had she even come 
here in the first place? What had she hoped to accomplish? &quot;No. Thank you, anyway. I 
should go.&quot;
	&quot;Rei, its pretty late. Maybe you should stay,&quot; Usagi said. She didn&#39;t know what 
was wrong, but she didn&#39;t want Rei to leave now. She wanted to know what was going 
on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Makoto rolled over to get a better look at the smaller girl lying next to her. She 
smiled to herself as she ran her fingers through Ami&#39;s short blue hair. She gently kissed 
the other girls soft lips. She checked to make sure Ami was asleep before quietly getting 
out of bed. She brought the sheet up higher to cover Ami. The other girl let out a small 
sound, startling Makoto in the dark room. Ami shifted around a bit before settling down 
and clutching the sheets closer to her. Makoto relaxed as she watched the other girl doze 
peacefully.
	Makoto silently walked out of the room. She padded across the cold floor. One 
of Ami&#39;s books lying open on the counter. She tried to read some of it but she quickly 
decided to leave that to Ami. She slipped a peace of paper between the pages before 
closing the book, knowing Ami would probably try to pick up where she left off in it 
later the next day. She&#146;d once wondered how Ami could have fallen in love with her. 
She knew the blue haired genius was many times over more intelligent than she was. 
Makoto had thought she&#146;d want someone who shared her passion for knowledge. She&#146;d 
brought it up with Ami, but the other girl had quickly dismissed her lover&#146;s worries. It 
didn&#146;t matter to her. She&#146;d said she couldn&#146;t really explain it. It was one of the few times 
Makoto had been able to catch Ami without an answer. Finally Ami had said that some 
things didn&#146;t need an explanation. Love was one of those things. She loved Makoto. She 
may not be able to explain it, but she knew in her heart that she did. Makoto hadn&#146;t 
given it a second thought afterwards. The blue haired genius was everything to her.
	Makoto walked through the dimly lit kitchen, briefly searching around for the 
light switch. She winced as the light turned on. She blinked several times to get her 
vision to adjust before walking over to the refrigerator. The brunette shivered from the 
cold air on her bare skin after opening it. She smiled when she saw one of Ami&#146;s 
sandwiches wrapped up. &#145;That girl needs to let me make her lunch more often,&#146; she 
thought to herself.
	&#147;Mako-chan?&#148; a sleepy voice said from behind her. She turned around to see 
Ami standing with the sheet wrapped around her delicate frame.
	&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Ami-chan. Did I wake you?&#148; Makoto asked.
	&#147;I saw the light turn on out here and I noticed you weren&#146;t in bed,&#148; Ami 
explained.  &#147;What are you doing up?&#148;
	Makoto smiled warmly and brought Ami into a loving embrace.  &#147;I was just 
thinking.&#148;
	Ami tilted her head to one side curiously. &#147;What about?&#148; She looked deeply 
into Makoto&#146;s dark green eyes, quickly losing herself in them, almost as if she were still 
dreaming.
	&#147;You,&#148; Makoto said softly. Everything felt right with the world while holding 
Ami in her arms. Ami giggled. &#147;No, I&#146;m serious.&#148; The taller girl gestured to the 
apartment. &#147;It used to be so lonely. I&#146;m really glad you&#146;re here.&#148;
	Ami smiled up at Makoto and put her hand on the brunette&#146;s cheek. &#147;So am I.&#148; 
She brought her lips up to Makoto&#146;s in a soft kiss. &#147;Come on back to bed, Mako-chan. 
Its lonely there, too.&#148;
	Makoto laughed. &#147;Okay, Ami-chan.&#148; She kissed the blue haired girl again. She 
took Ami&#146;s hand and let the other girl lead her back to their room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;Taru, are you okay?&#148;  ChibiUsa asked worriedly. Her reached out through the 
open window to grab the other girls hand. Hotaru had a haunted look in her eyes. 
ChibiUsa&#146;s heart ached as she looked into those frightened violet eyes.
	Hotaru started to relax as she felt ChibiUsa&#146;s warm hand against her own. 
Seeing the pink haired girl looking back at her soothed Hotaru. She looked down, 
feeling foolish. Her pale cheeks flushed red. &#147;I just needed to see you,&#148; she said quietly.
ChibiUsa lips formed a bright smile. It meant so much to her to hear the other girl came 
all this way to see her. Her expression became concerned when she realized Hotaru was 
worried about something. She blinked with realization. 
	&#147;Oh, Taru. It&#146;s okay. I&#146;m here,&#148; the future princess said. She wanted to hold the 
other girl, to go to her, but she was stopped by the wall between them. She could only 
reach the other girl through the open window.
	&#147;Hotaru,&#148; Momoko said besides the dark haired girl, startling her.
	Hotaru clutched ChibiUsa&#146;s hand tightly after hearing the other girl. She slowly 
turned around. &#147;Momo-chan, you scared me.&#148;
	&#147;Sorry about that. I talked to my mom. She said you can spend the night, too. I 
just told her you can&#146;t be away from ChibiUsa for too long of a time.&#148; Momoko laughed. 
&#147;Come on in.&#148;.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	A short time later, Momoko lay asleep in Diana&#146;s arms on her bed. ChibiUsa 
and Hotaru held each other under the blankets on Momoko&#146;s floor. Hotaru stared up at 
the ceiling, trying not to think. The darkness surrounded them, but that didn&#146;t bother 
her. Not with ChibiUsa beside her. Hotaru felt ChibiUsa gently stroking her hair. She 
held the other girl closer, not wanting to be apart again.
	&#147;Hotaru?&#148; ChibiUsa whispered to her dark haired lover. &#147;Why did you have to 
come see me so urgently?&#148; She smiled and kissed Hotaru lightly. &#147;I am glad you&#146;re 
here.&#148;
	&#147;Thanks. I am too.&#148; Hotaru snuggled closer to the other girl, trying to forget the 
horrible dream. &#147;I&#133;&#148; She began hesitantly. &#147;I had that dream again.&#148;
	&#147;Oh, Hotaru, I&#146;m so sorry.&#148; ChibiUsa wished there was some way she could 
stop Hotaru from having it, but it was a recurring nightmare for her. The dark haired 
girl was still tormented by visions from her past. Hotaru felt foolish. Running to 
ChibiUsa because of a dream. &#145;But then, isn&#146;t that what being in love with her means? 
Being able to go to her for comfort? Being able to tell her what frightens me the most? 
Knowing that no matter how childish it is, or how foolish, I can always go to her?&#146; 
	&#147;When I woke up, I was afraid, but it got worse when I realized you weren&#146;t 
there. Everything just started crashing down. I had to see you. I felt that if you were 
there, it would all seem okay.&#148; Hotaru closed her eyes tightly. The dream was still vivid 
in her mind. Tears started to well up in Hotaru&#146;s eyes as the dream came back to her. 
ChibiUsa gently wiped Hotaru&#146;s tears away with her fingertips. &#147;Its not your fault. You 
can&#146;t blame yourself for any of that. It was Mistress 9, not you.&#148;
	&#147;But I was there for everything that happened. It was my body,&#148; Hotaru blinked 
several more tears away.
	&#147;It may have been, but it still wasn&#146;t you. In the end, you managed to stop her.&#148;
Hotaru sniffled and tried to speak, but ChibiUsa silenced her with a soft kiss. &#147;You felt 
like its your fault because you couldn&#146;t stop her before she caused so much pain. There 
was nothing you could do. When I woke up after I got my Heart Crystal back, you&#146;d 
been changed into a baby from using your powers to stop Pharaoh 90. I felt horrible 
because I couldn&#146;t stop it. I felt that I should have known, that I should have said 
something when I saw you that last time. It took me a long time, but I realized there are 
some things we can&#146;t change. No matter how wrong it is, or how it seems we should 
have.&#148; ChibiUsa held the shuddering dark haired girl tightly against her. Her hand 
lightly rubbed Hotaru&#146;s back through the cloth of her nightgown. &#147;That&#146;s all in the past 
now. We have everything to look forward to. You and me. Both of us. Forever.&#148; She felt 
Hotaru&#146;s warm tears on her shoulder. The other girl&#146;s sobs slowly started to lessen. &#147;Its 
alright, Taru-chan. I&#146;m here.&#148; She held the dark haired girl protectively, wanting to 
keep away anymore of those horrible dreams.
	&#147;I.. I&#146;m sorry. I shouldn&#146;t let it get to me&#133; like this,&#148; Hotaru said between 
sobs.
	&#147;Don&#146;t be sorry. I&#146;m really glad you came. I missed you,&#148; ChibiUsa smiled. 
&#147;And don&#146;t worry about the dreams. That&#146;s all they are. And you can always come find 
me when you wake up. I&#146;m just sorry I wasn&#146;t there this time.&#148;
	&#147;Thanks, Odango-chan,&#148; Hotaru said softly.
	&#147;You mean everything to me, Taru. Don&#146;t let those dreams hurt you. They 
don&#146;t mean anything as long as we have each other.&#148;  ChibiUsa felt like she should say 
more, but she didn&#146;t have to. Her crimson eyes met with Hotaru&#146;s violet ones. Their lips 
met in the dark room, conveying more to each other than words could have.
	&#147;I love you,&#148; Hotaru whispered to the pink haired girl.
	&#147;I love you, too,&#148; ChibiUsa whispered back. She kissed Hotaru once again 
before laying her head back on a pillow. &#147;Goodnight, Hotaru.&#148;
	&#147;I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll go to sleep just yet. Could you stay up for a little bit so we 
could talk?&#148; Hotaru asked.
	&#147;Sure,&#148; ChibiUsa agreed. She felt Hotaru&#146;s hand on her own. 
	&#147;Thanks,&#148; Hotaru said gratefully. She knew ChibiUsa would probably fall 
asleep soon, but she didn&#146;t mind. She felt safe now that she was with the one she loved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Minako awoke with a start at the constant knocking she was hearing in her 
dreams. At first she&#39;d tried to not listen and stay in the warmth. But the constant rapping 
in her mind made her jolt awake from the annoyance. She turned all along the bed 
searching for the source, and found it in Rei. The raven haired beauty was at the window 
trying desperately to get Minako&#39;s attention. She walked all along the edge of the 
window calling, her voice barely reaching Minako&#39;s ears. Minako grabbed the robe 
beside her and tied a tight knot into the middle. She motioned for her friend to walk to 
the door and she&#39;d allow her inside.
	&quot;Mina-chan,&quot; Rei rasped and hugged her friend into a tight embrace. &quot;Oh, 
Mina-chan I&#39;m so tired. I really need someone to talk to please!&quot;
	&quot;Calm down, Rei-chan,&quot; Minako whispered in a soothing voice. &quot;It&#39;ll be okay. 
Tell me what&#39;s wrong.&quot; Rei let out several gasps of air trying to calm her nerves enough 
to tell Minako what was wrong but couldn&#146;t. 
	&quot;Mina-chan I&#39;m really scared...I miss you and the others.&quot; she began. &quot;I miss us 
being a team, and I miss spending more time together  like we used to. Most of all I miss 
Usagi. Our princess doesn&#39;t need us anymore and I feel useless. She...everyone is in love 
and I&#39;m set so far away you have forgotten me.&quot;
        &quot;Rei! &quot; Minako whispered in a harsh voice. &quot;I have never forgotten you and neither 
has our princess. She needs us more then ever, and with ChibiUsa on the way and the 
new responsibilities coming up the senshi are....&#148;
	&quot;That&#39;s just it. I don&#39;t think I can handle seeing Usagi and Mamoru together so 
happy everyday. I just can&#39;t Minako! I love her!&quot; Rei clasped her hands around her 
mouth and gasped. She wasn&#39;t supposed to say that, not to Minako!
	Minako just smiled. &quot;We all love her.&quot;
	&quot;Not like I do Mina-chan. Not like I do.&quot;
	&#147; I know,&#148; Minako said simply.
	Rei stared at Minako for a moment. &#147;What do you mean?&#148;
	&#147;I know how you feel about her. Who do you think you confided in back in the 
Silver Millennium?&#148; Minako winked at the raven haired girl. &#147;Besides, its not like its 
hard to notice.&#148;
	Rei was shocked. &#147;You know? Is it that obvious?&#148;
	Minako laughed. &#147;Probably not. I hadn&#146;t really noticed until I started 
remembering a few things from the past. Everything fell into place after seeing you 
around her a couple days later.&#148; Rei stared at her feet. She hadn&#146;t planned on anyone 
finding out how she felt about their princess, but now she knew that Minako had already 
found out. What did she think of her now? &#147;Its alright, Rei. I&#146;m you&#146;re friend. So are the 
others. None of us would mind. Mamoru might, though.&#148; Minako smiled, trying to help 
Rei feel better. 
	&#147;But what would Usagi think?&#148;
              &#147;I don&#146;t know. You&#146;d have to ask her.&#148; Minako said quietly. She needed to talk 
to Rei, but at the same time she didn&#146;t want to wake Natsuna by being too loud.
              &#147;What can I do? She&#146;s already in love with Mamoru. She marries him in the 
future and has a daughter with him. If I did manage to tell her how I felt and she felt the 
same, then I could damage so much in the future. ChibiUsa wouldn&#146;t even exist. Who 
knows what else might happen.&#148; Rei sighed deeply. The whole thing felt so futile. She 
wanted to tell Usagi, but she couldn&#146;t let herself endanger the future. She was a Sailor 
Senshi, after all.
              &#147;I&#146;m sorry, Rei. I want to tell you how this can work out, but I don&#146;t know. I 
wish I did. I just want everything to work out for you in the end, but I don&#146;t know what 
to do about it,&#148; Minako said sadly. She wanted to help. She was the Senshi of Love. She 
felt like she needed to do something to help her friend.
	&#147;I want to tell her, but I don&#146;t want to hurt her. Its probably better if I don&#146;t say 
anything,&#148; Rei said sullenly.
	&#147;Don&#146;t think like that. Think positively. If you&#146;re ever going to have a chance 
you can&#146;t give up now,&#148; Minako said with a determined gleam in her eyes.
	&#147;You&#146;re right, I guess. But I still don&#146;t know what I can do.&#148; Rei looked up and 
smiled at her friend. &#147;Thanks, Minako-chan. I feel a little better now.&#148;
	&#147;Anytime, Rei-chan.&#148;
	&#147;I should be going for now.&#148; Rei hugged Minako again and walked out the 
door. Minako waved to her as the raven haired girl started walking home. Minako 
waited until Rei was out of sight before slowly closing the door. She felt so helpless. She 
hated that feeling. She walked through the dark hallway towards the room she shared 
with Natsuna. She smiled as she walked past Artemis, curled up and asleep on the floor. 
She&#146;d always gone to him for advice. Now Rei had gone to her, but she was afraid she 
hadn&#146;t been of much help. Minako paused at the doorway to their room. Rei had seemed 
so empty lately. She was usually so full of life, but seeing everyone else with their lovers
really got to her. Minako missed the old Rei and now there was a chance to fix things 
for Rei, but what could she do about it? Minako&#146;s head was spinning as she tried to 
think of what, if anything, she should do. She sighed before walking into the bedroom. 
She needed sleep. And right now, she really wanted to be with the one she loved. She 
crawled into bed next to the other woman, her soft, reddish brown hair hanging past her
shoulders. She smiled as Natsuna continued sleeping. Minako pulled the blanket up and 
around her, snuggling close to Natsuna. She slowly started to drift off to sleep.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE NEXT DAY

	Setsuna picked up her small basket, trying to balance the weight of the 
tremendous amount of groceries and her addition to her chocolate stash. Turning around 
too fast, three rather large oranges dropped out of her basket. &#145;I knew I should have 
gotten a cart,&#146; she thought.
	She bent down and picked up two of the offending oranges, but her little 
sandaled foot knocked the third off balance, and it began to roll away.  &#147;Damn,&#148; she 
exclaimed under her breath.
	Walking at a fast pace, she caught up with the rolling orange, only to have it 
roll underneath a display case for some cereal boxes at the end of an aisle.  Setting down 
her basket very carefully, she got on her knees and looked under the display case.
	&#147;There you are you little&#133;&#148; She exclaimed, reaching for the orange.
	&#147;Setsuna?&#148;  A hand came to rest on her shoulder, making her leap up&#133;and 
slam her head on the bottom of the display table.  Holding her head and whimpering 
words of anger and embarrassment, she looked up into the eyes of her offender.
	The first thing she saw, actually, was the nice shoes on small feet. Eyes 
traveling up slowly, she took in the tight fitting jeans, stylish and trendy. Her red eyes 
traveled up the shapely legs to the small, flat stomach, and up to the small breasts.  Her 
eyes came to rest on the dark ponytail, which came to rest just below her right breast.  
Curiosity and familiarity making her eyes travel still farther, they halted to a stop at the 
dark blue eyes of her  offender.
	She sank into this deep shade of blue, and began to smile.  &#147;Seiya!&#148; Leaping up 
from her kneeling position and forgetting about her injured head, she threw her long 
arms around the taller woman&#146;s neck, laughing slightly.
	Seiya, a little surprised about Setsuna&#146;s attitude, was stunned. Setsuna, showing 
emotion?  A lot had changed since she had left Tokyo.  But the dark green hair brushed 
against her nose, smelling of forest green and something else she couldn&#146;t put her finger 
on.  Closing her beautiful dark blue eyes, she wrapped her arms around the green-haired 
woman&#146;s waist, leaning her head to rest on Setsuna&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;Setsuna&#133;&#148; The word 
was let out in a whisper, almost too quiet for Seiya to hear herself.  Sudden feelings of 
heat laced with desire invaded her mind, and it was covered in a clear transparent shell.  
Sudden memories, or maybe visions, she didn&#146;t know, entered her mind&#133;of two 
women, one with long black hair and one with long dark green hair standing on a 
balcony in dresses rimmed with gold, kissing and holding each other, trapped in an 
embrace similar to this one.  The heads turned, and a hazy Seiya kissed her green-haired 
goddess, bending her head down and sweeping her feet off the balcony.
	Setsuna&#146;s heart pounded in her ears.  Why did Seiya say her name like that?!  
That wasn&#146;t expected.  She didn&#146;t think Seiya held affections for anyone but her 
princess.  Why were Seiya&#146;s arms so warm?  Linked around her waist and pulling her so 
close?  What was she doing here in a supermarket, anyway? And why was her breath so 
warm against her cheek like that?  Sudden memories of Seiya in Crystal Tokyo, looking 
as fine as could be in a long flowing gown of blue and yellow stars, calling out to her.  It 
had only been once, the two had embraced and kissed, but she hadn&#146;t seen Seiya after 
that. She should have thought about it more, should have noticed Seiya more, because 
then maybe she could figure out her own feelings.
	Realizing where she was and what she&#146;d felt, and thought, and suddenly 
embarrassed by it, Seiya pulled away slightly.  Setsuna held on for another moment, 
reveling in the warmth of a body beside her, near her, and with her.  But the feeling 
suddenly cleared from her passion hazy mind, and she registered Seiya holding her 
waist at arm&#146;s length.  Unlinking her arms from around Seiya&#146;s neck, she realized how 
awful she must look&#133;jumping up like that after slamming her head into a table.  Oh, 
real smooth Setsuna!  Her mind shouted at her.
	Red eyes hardened.  Her internal defenses were locked again.  No more 
embarrassment.  Not again.  In the back of her mind, something ached.  It knew, more 
then Setsuna herself, that such rejection would harm her heart to the core.
	&#147;I&#146;m so glad to see you, Seiya.  What brings you back to Tokyo?&#148;  A forced 
smile crossed her red lips, not reaching her eyes at all.  Seiya cursed herself in her mind 
for being so stupid.
	&#147;Oh&#133;um&#133;well, I&#133;decided to come back for a visit.&#148;  She smiled, forced as 
well.  She didn&#146;t want to reveal her true intentions just yet.  She was planning to come 
to Tokyo, and stay.  She didn&#146;t want to watch her princess and sister fall deeply in love.  
An aching heart would never heal like that. Of course, the plan had backfired when 
Kakyuu had thought it a great idea to move back to Tokyo. Now her two sisters and her 
princess were right next door from her. She&#146;d been there visiting the night before when 
she&#146;d seen Yaten ready for her date with Kakyuu.
	Setsuna knew something was wrong.  Seiya didn&#146;t lie.  Not ever. Unless 
something was seriously wrong.  &#147;Oh, that&#146;s nice.&#148;  She bent down to pick up her 
basket.  &#147;Do you have a place to stay?&#148;
	&#147;Oh, yes, I rented a place just a few blocks from here.&#148;  Seiya smiled again, 
trying to lighten the mood.  &#145;Damnit,&#146; she thought, &#145;what have I done? Setsuna, please, 
don&#146;t be angry&#133;&#146;
	&#147;That&#146;s wonderful!  You should stop by to have dinner with us sometime.  
Which I have to go back and make now, so&#133;I&#146;ll see you around&#133;&#148; A horrible moment 
of emotion made her voice crack, and she turned away quickly, rushing to the check-out 
stand.  She waited a few minutes, and Seiya didn&#146;t come for her.  A menacing voice in 
her mind asked her if that was a good or bad thing.  Leaning on the mechanical food 
belt, she sighed. &#147;Always&#133;&#148; She breathed out.  Her red eyes shook suddenly, and she 
brought her hand up to cover them.
	Suddenly, two warm arms wrapped around her waist.  Startled, she tried to turn 
around, but the arms held her in place.
	Seiya leaned in, placing her head once again on Setsuna&#146;s shoulder. Setsuna&#146;s 
lovely back was against her chest now, full of warmth.  A mouth to an ear, she 
whispered, &#147;Would it&#133;be alright&#133;if I ate dinner with you tonight?&#148;
	Setsuna breathed in deeply.  &#147;I think that could be arranged&#133;&#148;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;Come on, Haruka!  The water&#146;s so warm!&#148;  Michiru splashed about, waving 
her long arms around in the water.  Haruka, standing atop a near-by rock, beamed down 
at her lover in the quiet stream.
	&#147;I AM coming in!&#148;  Jumping up in the air and tucking her knees under her 
chest gracefully, she slammed into the water, waves roaring in her ears.  She glanced up 
through the hazy stream water to see little white bubbles surround her and waves roll 
over her little sea nymph.
	A couple of seconds passed and Haruka shot out above the water, her head up 
toward the sun.  She struck such a graceful figure that Michiru almost gasped, streaks of 
crimson lining her cheeks.  When Haruka looked at her, she turned away, embarrassed.  
&#147;That wasn&#146;t the kind of entry I had hoped for.&#148; She stated, her voice dripping with 
sarcasm.  She looked over her shoulder slightly, her hair soaked with the stream water, 
creating an unearthly look about her.  Light green eyes pierced into blue ones, and then 
turned away, half-teasing, half-serious.
	&#147;Michiru&#133;&#148; Haruka called, only to see her little sea nymph swim ever faster 
away from her.  &#147;Hey, wait up!&#148;  Awkwardly splashing after her, she called again.
	Michiru turned only slightly, and began to laugh.  She saw Haruka struggling 
to catch up with her, knowing the taller girl was not much of a swimmer.  She began to 
slow down, half wanting her lover to catch up with her.  But the laughing was the main 
reason her shaking limbs could not keep up the fast pace she had used.
	Breathless, Haruka finally reached her.  &#147;You&#133;need to&#133;slow down&#133;girl!&#148;  
She exclaimed, her small tongue reaching the edge of her mouth in exhaustion.
	&#147;Hmm, really?&#148;  Michiru took this chance and wrapped her elegant arms 
around her lover&#146;s neck and kissed her slow, hard, and wet.  Haruka was tall enough to 
stand on the bottom of the water, but Michiru was not, and she wrapped her legs around 
Haruka&#146;s waist.  Rubbing her hips slowly up and down over the taller girl&#146;s mid-section, 
she let a moan escape through the kiss. Pulling away slowly, she smiled seductively.  &#147;Is 
it better slow?&#148;
	Haruka looked down at her nymph, eyes wide with desire and surprise. Finding 
her words that had been lost in the back of her throat, she swallowed hard.  &#147;It&#146;s always 
good with you.&#148;  She wrapped her arms tightly around Michiru&#146;s waist and leaned in to 
kiss her again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Seiya looked in the mirror again and pulled her skirt down.  She glanced 
nervously at herself, wondering if she went a little overboard with the make-up.
	Being a Starlight for so long had her comfortable with being a man. She had 
always thought she looked better in women&#146;s clothes, but to please the millions of 
screaming women as fans, she continued to play the part. But now, that was changing.  
Here she was, putting the finishing touches on herself before she would take Setsuna out 
to a nice fancy dinner.  Yaten had helped her pick out an outfit, but was it really 
appropriate?
	Even Seiya had to admit she looked killer in it.  Short black skirts look good on 
almost anyone.  The slit up the right side, however, was what would knock &#145;em out.  Her 
knee-high leather boots looked perfect with it, and the cream and black top she had on 
was perfect to complete the outfit.  But on the first date?  And to a fancy restaurant? 
Should she be dressed up in one of  those dresses that covered more of herself, like 
Michiru would always wear on big outings?
	That wasn&#146;t her style.
	Seiya sighed and looked at the floor.  In her minds eye she could see a beautiful 
Setsuna walk before her in a lovely gown, give her one look, and run back inside her 
house.  Seiya shook her head.  Setsuna wasn&#146;t like that.  The sophisticated dark-skinned 
woman she had always known to be calm and collected would never do something like 
that.
	Never.  That was a funny word.  Never.  She would have never thought about 
Setsuna as a potential lover.  Never.  But that didn&#146;t mean it wouldn&#146;t happen.  Not until 
that day, when she saw Setsuna in the Market, looking comfortable and sweet.  And 
when those long arms had come around her, and she had that forest green hair beneath 
her nose, her entire thought pattern changed.  No longer did she feel like she needed to 
hide from the love of Yaten and their Princess, not anymore.  All she really felt like she 
needed was to feel Setsuna&#146;s waist beneath her hands, and their lips together, and the
moonlight streaming in the window, and&#133;
	Seiya looked back up at herself. Why not?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Setsuna sighed as she looked in the mirror.
	&#147;You look beautiful, Setsuna-mama!&#148;  Hotaru giggled.
	&#147;I love the skirt!&#148;  ChibiUsa agreed, and turned to Hotaru.  &#147;You and I should 
go out like this sometime.&#148;
	&#147;You don&#146;t have enough money to take me out!&#148;  Hotaru laughed at the 
expression on her lover&#146;s face.  &#147;We will, Odango-chan.&#148;
	&#147;Come on you two, you&#146;re supposed to be helping me!&#148;  Setsuna turned around, 
exasperated.  The entire night the two girls she had always thought of as daughters had 
been phasing in and out of attention to her.  &#147;Are you really sure this is appropriate?&#148;
	&#147;Oh come on!  You look good in it.  I know Seiya&#146;ll like it!&#148;  ChibiUsa giggled, 
blushing a little.
	Setsuna sighed at her reflection.  She was wearing a velvet maroon skirt that 
went to her knees, maroon platform sandals (something Hotaru convinced her into 
wearing), and a black tank top with a maroon flowered design.  ChibiUsa had done her 
make-up, with a little help from her mom. That had scared Setsuna at first, knowing 
that this was Usagi they were talking about, but she was pleased with the results.  It 
seems that after years of practice Usagi had finally got something down to an art.
	Setsuna turned to the two giggling girls once again, and smiled.  They looked 
plenty confident that she was beautiful.  They were happy for her. Maybe they were 
smarter for being that way.
	Seiya had always been someone Setsuna had admired, not only for her 
continuing courage, but for her love for everything around her.  The entire ordeal with 
Usagi had been a hard one for everyone, but Seiya had handled it rather well, accepting 
what the future would not change.  Setsuna herself had to come to terms with what was 
destined too many times.  But when she had seen Seiya, she couldn&#146;t help but be excited, 
even if they hadn&#146;t been all that close. And when she had heard her name being 
whispered into the wind like that, the way Haruka whispered Michiru&#146;s name, the way 
ChibiUsa whispered Hotaru&#146;s name&#133;it made her feel like she was flying.  The 
realization that someone could fall in love with her was almost overwhelming.  And 
now that she was finally involved with someone, she couldn&#146;t help but feel nervous.  It 
was all too much of an emotional roller coaster, but she couldn&#146;t help being the first in
line for the dangerous ride.
	&#147;Come on, Setsuna, Seiya&#146;ll be here any minute!&#148;  She heard Haruka&#146;s call 
from down the hallway.
	&#147;I&#146;m almost finished.&#148;  Setsuna called back, and reached for the make-up on 
the table beside her.  Picking up the eyeliner, she placed two small wings off the edges 
of her eyelashes, and stood back.  &#147;Perfect.&#148;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Seiya took a deep breath.  She slowly raised her hand to the doorbell, and then 
stopped.  She was shaking.  How odd.  She had never started to shake out of nervousness 
before, even when she had stage-fright.  Maybe that was because she had always had her 
sisters for support.
	They couldn&#146;t help her now.
	Seiya took another deep breath and released it slowly.  She pressed the little lit 
up button, and then dropped her hand to the side and waited.
	She heard some noise inside, mostly Haruka&#146;s voice yelling.  She smiled. Good 
ol&#146; Haruka.
	The doorknob turned, and she felt her heart rise in her chest.  The door flung 
open, and there stood Haruka in the doorway.  Her gaze traveled over Seiya, who stood 
her ground, and then back up to her eyes.  With a grin and a nod of approval, she let out 
the breath she had been holding.
	&#147;Come mere you!&#148;  Haruka reached out and pulled Seiya close.  The two 
women were about the same height, Seiya just a little bit taller now due to her boots.  
They pulled out of the friendly embrace and smiled at each other. &#147;It&#146;s been too long.&#148;
	Seiya grinned.  &#147;It sure has.&#148;
	&#147;HAR-UUUKA!&#148;  Came a voice from inside, and the two women turned.
	&#147;You better come in before Michiru has a baby or something.&#148;  Haruka 
laughed, and pulled Seiya inside the house.  &#147;Come on, Setsuna&#146;s just finishing up.&#148;  
Seiya remembered the house from awhile ago, when they were just moving in, and now 
looked it over with interest.  Walking around toward the living room, she saw book-
cases full of books.  She smiled.  Michiru loved the arts, almost as bad as Mizuno Ami.
	&#147;SEIYA!&#148;  Michiru ran towards her friend and jumped into her arms. Seiya, on 
the other hand, was almost knocked over, and stumbled slightly from the awkwardness 
of her platform boots.
	&#147;Hey&#133;Michiru&#133;&#148; She ground out, trying to get a few breaths in through the 
squeezing she was forced into.  She glanced at Haruka for help, but the blonde woman 
was just laughing hysterically.  &#147;How&#146;s it&#133;going?&#148;
	&#147;SEIYA!  You&#146;ve been gone for so long!&#148;  The aqua head looked up at her, and 
the same color eyes stared into hers.  &#147;Why didn&#146;t you visit?&#148;  The tone was almost 
angry.
	&#147;I&#146;m sorry&#133;&#148; Seiya&#146;s explanation was halted as she heard footsteps. Michiru 
fell out of her arms and walked over to Haruka, and the two women held hands and 
smiled like proud parents or friends.  Seiya&#146;s heart started to pound with anticipation.  
She held her breath for the second time today and&#133;
	&#147;Hey Seiya!&#148;  Hotaru walked into the room, and everyone sighed. Hotaru 
looked a little angry.  &#147;What?&#148;
	&#147;Nothing.&#148;  Seiya smiled and held her arms open.  Hotaru ran into them and 
hugged Seiya&#146;s waist.
	&#147;You&#146;ve been gone for such a long time!&#148;
	&#147;I know, I know.&#148;
	&#147;SSSSEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIYYYYYYYAAAAAA!!!!&#148;  ChibiUsa&#146;s squeal rang 
throughout the room, and Seiya winced.  A pink whir of hair suddenly ran into the room 
and knocked both Seiya and Hotaru over.  &#147;THERE YOU ARE!&#148;  She hugged Seiya 
fiercely, who was trying desperately to not let her skirt ride up too high.
	&#147;Hey ChibiUsa, how are you?&#148;  She smiled once she got up.
	&#147;Hey you guys&#133;&#148; A soft voice came from across the room.  Seiya looked up to 
see Setsuna standing in the room&#146;s entryway.  Seiya felt the heat rising to her cheeks as 
she took in Setsuna.  The color was perfect on her, and long green hair flowed over her 
shoulders and down to her waist.
	Seiya found her voice again, and spoke.  &#147;Hi.&#148;
	&#147;Hi.&#148;  Setsuna smiled, happy with the effect she had on Seiya, but almost 
ashamed with the effect Seiya had on her.  Those long creamy legs had her own knees 
shaking and knocking against each other.  &#147;Should we get going?&#148;
	&#147;Sure.&#148;  Seiya walked the distance toward Setsuna, jut barely aware of the other 
women staring intently at them.  They walked out of the door together, hand in hand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Setsuna set down her glass of water, the ice rattling together as her hand shook.  
She swallowed hard.  She hoped Seiya hadn&#146;t noticed.
	How could she not notice every little tiny thing she was doing?  Those dark 
blue eyes stared at her through half closed lids and never wavered from her.  At least, 
they hadn&#146;t so far.  And she knew, because her own eyes couldn&#146;t take themselves of the 
mighty fine woman before her.
	Seiya seemed so together.  Like nothing was making her nervous in the least.  
Of course, she must have women lining up to just see her.  Being one of the Lights and 
all.  In fact, now that she thought of it&#133;Seiya probably dated all the time.  Was that 
what she was?  Just another date?  Maybe another one night stand?  Would Seiya forget 
about her once tonight was done?
	Setsuna tried to swallow the rising panic in her throat.  Her voice of reason 
came through the horrible questions.  &#145;Just ask her&#146;, it said.  &#145;Ask her if she really wants 
a real relationship.  Ask her what&#146;s going to happen tomorrow. What have you got to 
lose?&#146;
	But she knew what she had to lose already.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Seiya watched Setsuna set down her water glass with grace and elegance. 
Funny how wonderful traits like these could come out of a little motion like that.
	Seiya tried not to let her knees rattle together any louder.  It was all she could 
do to keep them from knocking the table over.  Setsuna seemed to be just fine.  She 
looked content, just nibbling on the fancy French dinner set before her.  Seiya wasn&#146;t 
hungry all of a sudden.  At least, not for food.
	Setsuna suddenly went tense.  Seiya felt herself become the same, and tried to 
relax.  Setsuna&#146;s dark red eyes stared up at her, full of questions.  Seiya looked at her 
likewise.
	Setsuna cleared her throat.  &#147;Um&#133;Seiya&#133;would it be alright if I&#133;asked you 
something&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Sure.&#148;  Seiya replied automatically and with a smile.  &#147;Anything you&#146;d like.&#148;
	&#147;Um&#133;do you&#133;date often?&#148;  Setsuna&#146;s eyes suddenly went fuzzy, and Seiya 
had the impression that she was going to lose that remarkable control.
	&#147;No, actually, I don&#146;t.  I&#146;ve stayed away from it because you can&#146;t really meet a 
lot of people if you&#146;re a superstar.&#148;  She smiled weakly.  &#147;That&#146;s one of the many 
problems with it.&#148;
	&#147;So you&#133;don&#146;t have any other&#133;&#148; Setsuna&#146;s eyes darted down to the floor.
	Seiya was quiet for a long time.  When she did speak, the tone was mixed with 
emotions neither woman could place.  &#147;No, Setsuna.  I don&#146;t have anyone else.&#148;  Setsuna 
looked up at her, all her emotions settling down with the reassurance.
	&#147;Mademoiselles?&#148;  The server stood over them, holding up a big tray. &#147;Would 
you two lovebirds like some desert?&#148;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Usagi walked into the restaurant, holding onto Mamoru&#146;s arm.  The server 
smiled at them both and led them to a table by the window they had become accustomed 
to.
	Mamoru pulled out Usagi&#146;s chair, then briskly went to his own.  Usagi sat 
down, feeling a little bewildered.  Why hadn&#146;t he touched her?  He always did.  Every 
time he would pull out her chair he would brush her long hair away from her neck and 
kiss her on the cheek.  Every time.  What was so different about now?
	Mamoru didn&#146;t look at her, even as they ordered.  After a long silence among 
the table, Usagi got restless.  &#147;Is there something wrong, Mamo-chan?&#148; He didn&#146;t 
respond.  &#147;You seem angry.  Did I do something to upset you?&#148;  Still no response.  &#147;Did 
I step on your foot again?  I&#146;m sorry I&#133;I know I&#146;m clumsy, but I didn&#146;t know it upset 
you this much&#133;&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s not that, Usako.&#148;  Mamoru still didn&#146;t look at her.  &#147;Nothing&#146;s wrong with 
me.&#148;
	&#147;What do you mean?&#148;  Usagi became worried.
	&#147;I know your secret, Usako.  I know why you don&#146;t see me that often anymore.  
I know why you find so much time for your friends all the time&#133;for her.&#148;
	Usagi felt anger rise up in her cheeks.  &#147;What the hell are you talking about?&#148;
	&#147;You know what I&#146;m talking about.&#148;  Two angry black beads that were his eyes 
stared into hers.  &#147;I know who you&#146;re in love with.&#148;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;Hey, isn&#146;t that Usagi-san and Mamoru-san?&#148;  Seiya pointed to a table by the 
window.  Setsuna looked over to the couple and smiled.
	&#147;It sure is.  I didn&#146;t know they were going out tonight.  I wouldn&#146;t have asked 
Usagi for help if I knew she had to get ready.&#148;
	&#147;You asked her for help?&#148;
	&#147;Yeah, with my make-up.&#148;  Setsuna blushed slightly, the little crimson streaks 
clashing with her dark skin.  &#147;I&#146;m not exactly a DaVinci with it.  I&#146;m more like 
Picasso.&#148;
	Seiya laughed.  &#147;Hey, I know how it is.  Luckily they make you wear make-up 
in music videos and stuff like that, so I wore it the entire time.&#148;
	Setsuna&#146;s red eyes grew wide.  &#147;Really?  That&#146;s actually really cool.&#148; She 
paused for a second, as if contemplating what she was going to say next. &#147;Tell me more 
about being a music star.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;Mamoru&#133;you think I&#146;m in love with&#133;&#148; Usagi&#146;s eyes filled with tears.
	&#147;I don&#146;t think, Usako, I know.  You love her, more then you do me, obviously.&#148;  
Mamoru rolled his eyes.  &#147;Quit with the goodie-two-shoe thing.  I know you love her.&#148;
	&#147;I&#133;I love you, Mamo-chan.  I always have.  I always will.  If you don&#146;t believe 
me, look to the future to tell you!  We&#146;ll be together, you and I, and ChibiUsa will be 
born.  If you don&#146;t believe that, what else can you believe in?&#148;
	&#147;The past?&#148;  Mamoru&#146;s voice almost dripped with sarcasm.  &#147;Sure, like the past 
is any proof.  The past is what it is, the past.  No longer here. Your precious little world 
revolves around her, Usagi, and that&#146;s what&#146;s really going on.  I don&#146;t know how I 
didn&#146;t notice before.  You always running to her when you had a problem.  I was so 
blind&#133;&#148;
	&#147;You were a selfish asshole, that&#146;s what you were.&#148;  Usagi&#146;s voice was full of 
something that resembled hatred as the crystal tears streamed down her cheeks.  &#147;The 
only problem I ever had in my life was you.  You took away everything I had, you and 
your promises of love ever-lasting.  You pretended to trust me.  You say I love someone 
else.  Fuck you.&#148;  Usagi stood up and raised her voice.  &#147;Fuck you, Mamoru.  You don&#146;t 
disserve to be in my company.&#148; And with that, the tiny woman turned on her heel and 
quickly walked out of the restaurant, hearing claps and cheers behind her.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Setsuna stood up, worried.  &#147;She doesn&#146;t have a way home&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Come on, we can still catch her.&#148;  Seiya threw down a hundred and grabbed 
Setsuna&#146;s hand.  They ran, somewhat awkwardly, toward the door, and outside into the 
cold air of night.
	&#147;Oh!&#148;  Setsuna exclaimed as the air hit her skin.  Seiya pulled her closer and 
wrapped her coat halfway around her.  Setsuna felt herself blush.
	&#147;USAGI!!&#148;  Seiya yelled, and Setsuna did the same.  Finally they saw the girl 
turn around, and ran towards her.  &#147;Usagi, what&#146;s wrong?  Do you need a lift?&#148;
	The girl took a few shuddering breaths before finally speaking. &#147;No&#133;it&#146;s 
nothing.  I&#133;I need to take a walk.  But thank you for&#133;asking.&#148;  She spun around and 
began to run, leaving the two women a little perplexed.
	&#147;Seiya&#133;it&#146;s really cold out here&#133;&#148; Setsuna shuddered.
	&#147;You&#146;re right.&#148;  Seiya finally took her gaze away from the retreating blonde 
and back to the woman in her arms.  &#147;Come on, let&#146;s go to the car.&#148;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Setsuna marveled at the rooms in Seiya&#146;s apartment.  Little gasps would escape 
that long throat and those red lips, leaving Seiya anxious to touch them.  To feel them 
beneath her fingertips.
	&#147;Oh Seiya, your flat is beautiful!&#148;  Setsuna spun halfway around to look at her.  
&#147;I love it!&#148;
	&#147;Thank you.&#148;  Seiya smiled.  &#147;How do you like your coffee?&#148;
	&#147;Black, one spoon of sugar.&#148;
	&#147;Figures&#133;&#148; She muttered under her breath.
	&#147;What?&#148;
	&#147;Nothing&#133;&#148; Seiya smiled again and began to pour the liquid into two cups.  
Once she was done, she picked them both up and went into the living room.
	She almost dropped them.
	There was Setsuna, draped across her dark blue leather couch, looking 
absolutely delicious.  She hadn&#146;t heard Seiya, and moved around a little bit on the couch 
to get comfortable.  The maroon skirt inched higher up her thighs, and Seiya had to 
force herself to keep standing.
	She walked briskly over to the table and set down the drinks.  Setsuna only had 
a small amount of time to look up before Seiya&#146;s arm came around her and their mouths 
clashed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Usagi liked the feeling of the cool air go through her hair.  Her white dress 
didn&#146;t cover up much.  But, somehow, the cold was refreshing tonight.  A little strange 
perhaps, yes, but still refreshing.
	Usagi knew where she was going.  She knew what she had to do. Maybe that 
was what she had needed to do all along.  Every little fight and every little emotion she 
had with him seemed to be swept away so easily now. She knew what she wanted.
	She ran up the cement steps, her little white shoes making small clicking 
noises.  She heard noise already coming from the structure in front of her, and saw a tall 
figure in the shadow of the bamboo door.  She ran towards it, stumbling where the 
stones jutted out from the walkway.
	The figure must have heard her, and opened the bamboo door. &#147;Hello?&#148;  She 
called.
	Usagi fell into her arms, crying and sobbing.  &#147;REI!&#148;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystal Tokyo
30th century

Tsukino-Hino Usagi walked along the marbled floors of Tokyo&#146;s Crystal Palace, her 
heels clicking onto the scratchable material easily. She reached near her hand and felt 
the small promise ring on her wedding finger. The tiny diamond that had been her gift 
from Mamoru. She smiled kindly at the memory, not everything she had remembered 
from her past lover that was so terrible. She knew that they had loved each other at the 
time. It was something that their souls needed to play out. Something that had to be 
finished in it&#146;s own course. She heard the playing in Small Lady&#146;s bedroom, and knew 
that her father had come to see the small child. She was, however no longer a child. 
Small Lady. Ten to this day to be precise, and a growing lovely women at that. She had 
been a child conceived in love and devotion, and a child that would one day become 
Queen of the Crystal Tokyo. But, in the end the one that Usagi had loved the most had 
been Rei. No one understood that more then the senshi of her court, no one more so than 
her daughter who would one day also fall in love with a woman when she went back into 
the past. Of course, Small Lady didn&#146;t know that yet. There were some secrets the 
mother still had to keep from her daughter.
	Chiba Mamoru had later married, too. He ruled over Elysian as well as any of 
the senshi or even Usagi herself. He was still king of the Earth, just as Usagi was Queen, 
and his right to rule over his kingdom of Elysian was only natural. Usagi never failed to 
allow his input and decisions to her Queendom to not be recognized.  She walked in her 
bedroom and felt the warmth of her lover next to her and smiled slyly.
	&#147;Usagi-chan?&#148; Rei&#146;s tiny voice mumbled in her awakened sleep.
	&#147;Yes?&#148; Usagi asked. She felt Rei&#146;s creamy arms wrap around her silken clothed 
breasts, and cooed.
	&#147;I love you.&#148;
	&#147;I love you, too.&#148;
