<h1>Eien no Nedan (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note:
Throughout the story, I consistently refer to the Senshi of the past 
by their planet names only. Senshi of the present are referred to as 
Sailor whatever. Hopefully this makes it easier to follow the 
continuity of the story. 

My thanks go to the hauthor list for all your feedback and to Shonen 
Knife for writing incredible music to write fanfic by. 

My last note is the important one - I dedicate this story to my friend 
Elena, the best audience anyone could ever hope for. Thank you so much 
for your support and guidance. And for your superb use of the English 
language. Ti ringrazio molto! Sei la migliore! (I hope that&#39;s right!) 

------------------------------------------------------------

Michiru&#39;s eyes opened. Her mind searched for the noise that had 
awakened her. Soft footsteps and the rustle of silk drew her attention 
to the front door. The door closed with a soft click and Michiru 
turned her head to see Setsuna just entering the living room. 

Michiru rubbed her eyes and looked down at the blonde head in her lap. 
She smiled slightly, realizing that they must have fallen asleep on 
the sofa, after settling down to listen to a new CD the night before. 
Automatically, Michiru reached out to sense Hotaru, reassuring herself 
that the child slept soundly. 

Setsuna stepped behind Michiru, and placed a hand on her shoulder. 
Michiru reached up and covered the hand with her own. 

&quot;Long night at the observatory?&quot; 

Setsuna nodded, trying to stifle a yawn. &quot;They&#39;re thinking about 
taking away Pluto&#39;s status as a planet.&quot; She smiled tiredly. Michiru 
squeezed her hand and pulled her own away. 

&quot;Go to bed. We&#39;ll watch.&quot; Michiru glanced at the clock - it was almost 
5 AM. She thought of the promise they had made, to protect Sailor 
Saturn and raise Hotaru as their own. Ever since Sailor Saturn had 
reawakened, the three older women had agreed that at least one would 
remain on watch in case Hotaru should need comfort or companionship. 
An ancient mind in such a young body was occasionally the cause of 
nightmares or physical discomfort. 

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Setsuna glanced pointedly at Haruka. 

Michiru nodded. &quot;It&#39;s morning already. She&#39;ll be up soon anyway.&quot; 

Setsuna stifled another yawn. &quot;Good night then.&quot; She turned towards 
the door of her room. 

&quot;Sleep well.&quot; Michiru called softly after her. She sat quietly for a 
while, one hand loosely entangled in Haruka&#39;s hair. She let her 
thoughts wander, thinking of the people with whom she was now sharing 
her life. 

------------------------------------------------------------

As a young girl, Michiru had been considered precocious, aloof. She 
had never had many friends, or even acquaintances, and had taken 
refuge in her abilities as a musician and painter to maintain her 
privacy. The excuse of practice allowed her to remain apart from her 
peers, both in school and in the various orchestras in which she 
played. By the time she had awakened as Sailor Neptune, she had 
reconciled herself to a life alone. 

Alone, as she had been in the past. Her memory was filled with years 
of solitude, punctuated by feelings of a greater purpose, a destiny. 
She had no idea what these feelings meant, but she was used to them - 
she thought. Then, one evening, worn out physically and emotionally 
from a difficult battle with a human-turned-monster, she had had a 
dream. She saw the destruction of the world, the Silence. And in the 
midst of the cataclysm stood a figure, solid and strong in the center 
of the storm, wielding a sword. She had awakened with a desperate need 
to see the figure&#39;s face. The same dream continued to haunt her for 
weeks, but every time she was unable to see who the person was. The 
figure seemed so familiar, and yet... 

Then came the day when she was introduced to Haruka. Michiru had long 
been following the races of this remarkable woman. She had watched in 
fascination as Haruka had defeated all her opponents with 
single-minded determination, whether on foot, or in motor sports. 
Michiru could see that some competitors quailed if Haruka even glanced 
their way. Her will was so strong, it dominated every arena in which 
she performed. Michiru felt an incredible attraction to this 
mysterious woman. Casual inquiries turned up a figure as aloof and 
solitary as herself, an orphan, also like herself. Enthralled, Michiru 
had attended this meet with one of her few friends, the runner Elsa 
Grey, determined to learn about Tenou Haruka. 

As the runners stood at the starting blocks, Michiru had had a vision. 
She could see the storm, the Silence, and a figure, screaming with 
fury, in the center. The figure - the one she was searching for she 
was sure, was Haruka. There, in the midst of the raging tempest, 
Michiru called to Haruka, warning her of the Silence, telling her of 
the Talismans, the need to find the Messiah. Then the starter called 
the runners to the blocks and Michiru had been drawn back to the 
present. She had leaned heavily on the rail in front of her and 
sighed. 

After the race, Michiru had asked Elsa to introduce her to Haruka. As 
she approached the tall blonde, Michiru felt unaccountably nervous. 
She let her eyes drop, unwilling to face the intensity of Haruka&#39;s 
dark gaze. When she finally looked up, memories came flooding back to 
her, powerful visions of this same woman and herself, locked together 
in intimate embraces, of passion in love and in battle. The intensity 
as they locked eyes was so profound that Michiru imagined that 
electricity, visible to all, shot between them. She could see Haruka 
visibly recoil from her, and dropped her eyes once again. 

To Michiru&#39;s disappointment, that meeting had gone badly. Haruka had 
rejected her, putting distance between them. But Michiru had not given 
up. She had followed Haruka, watching her, until the day that fate had 
ordained for Sailor Uranus to reawaken. 

And then the remaining pieces had fallen into place. The attraction 
between them had grown, coming together with memories of their past 
lives. 

Michiru remembered their first evening together. 

She had asked Haruka to drive her along the coast in her car. Boldly, 
Haruka had told Michiru that she had no intention of letting her leave 
that night. Michiru had laughed, and allowed a hand to gently touch 
Haruka on the leg. She watched as the muscle tensed, then relaxed, but 
no change came over Haruka&#39;s calm face. Michiru looked at Haruka&#39;s jaw 
muscles, and without realizing she was even moving, Michiru drew one 
finger along that strong jawline. Haruka turned to her, eyes large 
with wonder, and Michiru again had a vision. She saw Haruka, 
gloriously naked, head straining backwards in passion, while she, 
Michiru, caressed the athletic body below her. Michiru blushed 
furiously, turning back to stare at the road ahead. She glanced 
sidelong at her companion. Haruka&#39;s face was still impassive, but 
Michiru could see a flush along her neck above the collar, and she was 
breathing quickly, shallowly. Michiru felt sure that Haruka had seen 
the same vision. 

Michiru felt a thrill run through her, and she too, began to breath a 
little quickly. The feel of skin, burning hot, possessed her finger 
tips, the taste of lips, cool and sweet, came to her mouth. Michiru&#39;s 
hand covered her mouth in astonishment. She could not bring herself to 
look at Haruka, but eventually fascination and desire won over fear. 
The blonde woman sat, stiff and tall, both hands clenched on the 
steering wheel. Her eyes looked vague, disconnected from the road, her 
breathing rapid. Michiru stared openly as, for a split second, Haruka 
let her eyes close, a small moan escaping her mouth. Then just as 
quickly, her eyes opened again, her mouth closed, and she was in 
control once more. 

Michiru sat in the passenger&#39;s seat and shivered with the sensations 
that washed over her. She was torn between laughter, tears, confusion 
and desire. There was no doubt in her mind that they had been lovers 
once, and not much that they would be again. Haruka&#39;s icy control of 
her emotions made Michiru feel a cold pit in the middle of her 
stomach, however. She did not know this woman - was she ever likely 
to? Could she break through this reserve and find the person 
underneath? 

Scenes of her past life threatened to overwhelm her. Michiru closed 
her eyes and let the memories come. Impressions of herself in battle, 
back to back with Sailor Uranus came to her mind, and images of a 
crystal castle and a soft bed, the two of them intertwined. 

In her mind, she could see Haruka roll over and smile at her. Michiru 
felt the hot tears well up in her eyes, as she registered the 
contentment in that smile. A large teardrop ran silently down her 
face. Michiru was startled out of her reverie by a warm hand that 
brushed the teardrop away. 

&quot;Does the sight of me smiling make you that sad?&quot; Haruka tried to 
laugh, but her voice was dry. 

Michiru was shocked. &quot;You saw that?&quot; Haruka was silent as she turned 
the car off the road and pulled up by a lighthouse. The sun had gone 
down, and the stars had begun to glitter in the sky. 

After parking the car, Haruka turned to Michiru and nodded. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know why, but I feel as if I need to protect you from sadness.&quot; Her 
voice was soft, tender. She reached out and touched Michiru&#39;s cheek 
again, tracing the path the tear had taken. Michiru reached up and 
covered the hand, leaning into it. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry - please excuse my foolishness...&quot; Michiru began pulling 
away. But Haruka leaned forward and Michiru was silenced by a finger 
touching her lips. Michiru could hear her own blood pound in her ears. 
Haruka let her fingers linger for a moment, Michiru reached up and 
took them in her own. She looked at the long tapering fingers, then at 
the teal eyes that watched her. 

&quot;You play an instrument?&quot; Michiru asked. Haruka&#39;s eyes widened 
slightly. 

&quot;Yes, piano. Why?&quot; 

Michiru released Haruka&#39;s hands with a light laugh and smoothed her 
skirt. &quot;Can we walk? The evening is so beautiful.&quot; 

Haruka got out and opened the door for Michiru. Michiru stood, then 
shooting Haruka a small smile, started for the lighthouse on the short 
quay. When they reached the edge of the pier, Michiru leaned on the 
railing, letting the seabreeze fill her senses. She closed her eyes 
and let the wet air bring messages of love, and hate, and hope. 

When she opened her eyes, she found Haruka staring at her intensely. 
The blonde gazed out at the water, then turned back to Michiru. 

&quot;I understand now,&quot; she said calmly. &quot;when we met, you asked me if I 
heard the wind rustle. It scared me badly.&quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; 

&quot;Because I didn&#39;t like to be obvious. I thought it was a secret. I had 
no idea about you.&quot; The two women were silent for a few moments. 

&quot;What does the wind tell you now?&quot; Michiru asked. 

&quot;That tonight people will live - and die. That there will be a success 
and a failure. That tonight a baby will be born and a man will commit 
suicide.&quot; Haruka shrugged. &quot;What do these messages mean to me?&quot; Her 
voice was bitter. 

Michiru put her hand on Haruka&#39;s arm and looked up into eyes so 
familiar, and so unfamiliar. &quot;It means that we can still make a 
difference. We can find the Talismans and stop the Silence.&quot; 

Haruka stood away from the railing and looked down into Michiru&#39;s 
face. &quot;I don&#39;t know why, but I feel...&quot; words failed her. Michiru 
touched her lips with a finger. 

Michiru pulled her finger back slightly, feeling Haruka lean forward. 
Slowly, she guided Haruka forward until they nearly touched. The teal 
eyes were wide and vulnerable. &quot;Michiru, I...&quot; Haruka began. 

&quot;Shhhhh...&quot; Michiru said and kissed Haruka firmly. &quot;I won&#39;t let you 
leave tonight.&quot; she said, when they finally separated. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Michiru sighed with the memory. She could see the outline of trees in 
the greyness of predawn and a hint of lavender in the sky. She thought 
of how little she knew of the women with whom she now lived. 

When Setsuna joined Michiru and Haruka, she brought with her an 
essential part of themselves, one they had not known they had been 
missing. Their powers had grown, and their identity as Senshi. Setsuna 
had also come with something more crucial - knowledge that they were 
holders of the Talismans. And that they were part of a team. They 
searched their memories, and had found a new part of their true 
selves, that they were the Senshi that protected the Earth from 
threats from outside the solar system. As a team, joined with the 
other Senshi, they defeated the new evil and had restored peace to 
Earth. 

But things were different in their new lives and this was made more 
evident the day Setsuna came to them, carrying the infant Hotaru. She 
had explained that in this incarnation, it was part of their purpose 
to protect and raise Hotaru, and train Sailor Saturn. Haruka and 
Michiru had readily agreed to this, and they immediately moved in 
together to this house in the country. 

In their pasts, both Neptune and Uranus had respected Pluto and 
Saturn, and felt affection for them as fellow Senshi. Yet she and 
Haruka could not have predicted the affection that they had come to 
feel as humans for Setsuna and Hotaru. 

Michiru closed her eyes, sensing again Hotaru&#39;s steady breathing, now 
joined by Setsuna&#39;s slower rhythm. Michiru&#39;s heart felt full with a 
sensation she had thought she would never know. For she had come to 
think of them as a family. &quot;Michiru-mama,&quot; Hotaru called her and it 
was indeed a maternal love she felt for the young girl. 

Michiru&#39;s emotions concerning Setsuna were a little more complex. She 
and Haruka had discussed the situation before they moved in to this 
house. It seemed so unfair that Setsuna, alone of the adults, should 
not have companionship and comfort. It was awkward, but eventually, 
Michiru and Haruka had confronted Setsuna about it. 

Blushing furiously, they had asked Setsuna about sleeping 
arrangements. After a prolonged consultation, the three agreed that 
Haruka and Michiru would share the master bedroom, while Setsuna took 
the bedroom next to Hotaru. 

Over the years, they had come to realize that Setsuna was not 
attracted to them sexually, but nonetheless, they had always left the 
option open. Should Setsuna need them, they would be there for her. 

Michiru heard the clock chime 5:30 AM. Haruka stirred slightly, a 
small noise and a stretch signaling her awakening out of a deep sleep. 
Michiru ran one hand along the tousled blonde head and down Haruka&#39;s 
spine. A smile came to Haruka&#39;s lips and another moan, this one very 
much like a purr. Haruka&#39;s eyes fluttered, then opened. She rolled 
over and looked up into Michiru&#39;s sleepy face. 

&quot;Did we fall asleep on the couch?&quot; Haruka laughed. &quot;I knew we 
shouldn&#39;t have bought such a comfortable sofa.&quot; 

Michiru smiled into the dark blue-green eyes that regarded her. She 
felt so privileged to see this side of Haruka. The tall blonde guarded 
her inner self so carefully, never letting anyone, except Michiru and 
more often now, Setsuna and Hotaru, see her tenderness. But when they 
were together, Michiru had seen Haruka, fragile, gentle and open, with 
no pretenses. Haruka as a lover had been a revelation. As a Senshi she 
was so fierce, so single-minded and determined that Michiru had half 
expected bed to be a battleground. Instead she found Haruka playful 
and considerate. And not surprisingly, passionate. It was not in 
Haruka&#39;s nature to do things by half. 

Michiru leaned over and kissed Haruka lightly. &quot;Good morning. Setsuna 
has come home - she&#39;s gone to bed.&quot; Haruka nodded and stretched 
luxuriously. Michiru continued. &quot;I told her we&#39;d watch until she woke 
up.&quot; 

Haruka looked at her watch. &quot;I&#39;ll bathe first. Unless you&#39;d like to 
join me?&quot; her voice was teasing. 

Michiru laughed. &quot;Maybe I will - it&#39;s not like Hotaru can&#39;t call us if 
she needs.&quot; She shook her head and gave Haruka a shove. &quot;No, no - go 
have your bath. I&#39;ll make some coffee.&quot; Haruka stood up and leaning 
down, kissed Michiru on the head. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Michiru was sitting at the kitchen table, sipping coffee, when Hotaru 
woke up. Rubbing her face sleepily, she came into the kitchen. Large 
violet eyes lit up at the sight of Michiru. 

&quot;Michiru-mama! Ohayo!&quot; Hotaru appeared to be a small, delicate 12 
year-old, but her eyes belied her physical age. 

Michiru smiled at her &quot;daughter.&quot; &quot;Good morning, Hotaru-chan. Did you 
sleep well?&quot; 

Hotaru&#39;s face went blank, then her brows drew together. Michiru felt 
herself tense slightly, as she waited for the response. 

&quot;I had a dream...a voice called me. It spoke of a price...it was from 
very long time ago.&quot; Her young face was screwed up in an effort to 
concentrate. 

Michiru rose and took the girl&#39;s hand. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Michiru was 
worried for the girl, burdened as she was with the immense power of 
Sailor Saturn. She placed a hand on Hotaru&#39;s forehead, then cheek. 
Hotaru broke from her reverie and smiled up at Michiru. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine, thank you, Michiru-mama. If you think it&#39;s important, I can 
have the dream again.&quot; Disconcertingly ancient eyes stared up at her 
from a pale face. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s important.&quot; Michiru reassured her. &quot;We were 
planning on going to the park this weekend for a picnic,&quot; she changed 
the subject, &quot;why don&#39;t you invite Chibi-Usa?&quot; Hotaru once again 
became a young girl, clapping her hands in delight. &quot;Go get ready for 
school now, and I&#39;ll get your breakfast ready.&quot; 

As she prepared breakfast, Michiru continued to think about her new 
family, and by extension, the other Senshi. Her memories of the past 
held respect and love of a kind, but never the kinds of emotion she 
now felt for these people. Mamoru, Usagi and the young women who were 
the Inner Senshi, she had come to love in a way that would have been 
impossible in the past. When she had accepted her memories of Sailor 
Neptune, Michiru had sworn to protect them, but now...now she would 
gladly sacrifice herself (indeed she had done so,) for any of these 
young women and their Prince. But even more importantly, she 
considered them her friends and her family. 

Haruka walked in, a towel around her neck, dressed in jeans and a 
white button-down shirt, worn loose - a relic from their school days. 
Hotaru ran in and threw her arms around Haruka&#39;s waist. Haruka laughed 
and hugged the girl back. Hotaru gave her a squeeze and reached up to 
stroke the blonde woman&#39;s cheek. 

&quot;I have the softest Papa around,&quot; she giggled and sat down to eat the 
breakfast Michiru was placing on the table. Haruka smiled and shot a 
look at Michiru. 

This was another awkward topic, or might have been, but for the 
awakening of Sailor Saturn. When Hotaru had been a mere 4 years old 
physically, Saturn had reawakened so that the Senshi could defeat 
Neherenia for the final time. While young Hotaru might have been 
confused by their relationship, after Saturn had awakened, the 
question never arose. Hotaru accepted them readily as a couple, 
occasionally teasing Haruka about her role as &quot;Papa,&quot; commenting on 
her feminine figure, or lack of facial hair. Surprisingly Haruka did 
not seem to mind this. In fact, Michiru had often seen a tender look 
pass across Haruka&#39;s face as she watched Hotaru. 

After breakfast, Haruka left with Hotaru as she did every morning, 
dropping the girl off at school on her way to the racetrack. 

Michiru kissed Haruka lightly on the cheek as she left, whispering as 
she did, &quot;When you come home, I think we&#39;ll need to talk.&quot; Haruka 
nodded and ushered Hotaru out the door. 

Michiru cleaned up the kitchen and sat for a while, reading. She could 
hear Setsuna rise, bathe and move around her room, dressing. When 
Setsuna finally entered the kitchen, Michiru slid a cup of coffee 
across the table towards her. She smiled gratefully and sat down to 
drink it. 

Michiru placed the carafe on the table and stood. &quot;I&#39;ll be painting, 
if you want to talk.&quot; 

Setsuna nodded without answering. 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

The studio in their house had originally been designed as a 
conservatory. Large windows flooded the room with bright morning 
sunshine, while Michiru set up her easel. When all her equipment was 
prepared she closed her eyes for a moment, letting the image enter her 
mind. When her eyes opened, she had already covered the canvas with a 
wash of dark color. She let the feeling of the image flow through her, 
transferring itself to the canvas. The motions of painting became a 
deliberate dance, at the center of which Michiru&#39;s mind slowed and 
calmed, coming at last to rest.
