<h1>Absence (part 52 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch51.html">Back to Part 51</a><pre>&quot;...Oh, and Artemis, don&#39;t let anybody see you or Luna in the hospital,&quot; 
Rei heard Minako speak into her wrist communicator in the backseat of 
Haruka&#39;s convertible. Despite her words to the contrary, the Senshi of 
Love had ended up riding in the car with Michiru behind the wheel, and 
didn&#39;t seem the least bit nervous about it. &quot;They might think you have 
fleas, and sick people don&#39;t need unhygienic animals roaming about the 
place... yes, I know you don&#39;t have fleas, Artemis, I was just saying... 
yeah, okay, okay. Look, we&#39;re going into a tunnel, so I have to go... I 
know this isn&#39;t a cell phone. Yes, I&#39;ll be careful. Bye!&quot; Minako 
released a sigh and shut her eyes briefly as she closed the cover over 
her watch communicator. She turned to Hotaru, who was sitting next to 
her, and put on a reassuring smile. &quot;See? Artemis and Luna will keep an 
eye on Chibi-Usa; she&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Minako said to the pensive Outer 
Senshi, who nodded in response as she stared up at the blonde with big, 
hopeful violet eyes. &quot;It&#39;s us I&#39;m more worried about...&quot; she added under 
her breath, looking away from Hotaru.

Rei knew Minako&#39;s eyes were boring anxiously into the back of her seat, 
her earlier instincts about the upcoming youma confrontation no doubt 
starting to worry the Senshi of Love. While the premonition was 
troubling to Rei also, she wasn&#39;t that concerned by it. No matter what 
the vision meant, there was really nothing she could do about it until 
it was upon her, so she had decided to put it out of her mind. There was 
no use dwelling on something you had no control over. Rei smirked 
bitterly at the irony of her musings. Her beliefs didn&#39;t always fit well 
with every situation.

Rei rested her head back against the passenger seat&#39;s headrest, and 
stared with half-lidded glassy eyes out the windscreen at the red car a 
short distance in front of Haruka&#39;s. She could see the backs of Ami and 
Makoto&#39;s heads, but they obscured the view of Usagi who was sitting in 
the front seat of the car, beside her boyfriend. Like she should be. Rei 
pulled her black coat closer around her body. It was pretty cold out 
tonight, and even though she was in the convertible with the top up, the 
Fire Senshi felt the chill.

&quot;Shall I turn the heat up?&quot; Michiru asked from the driver&#39;s seat, 
glancing at the miko.

Rei shook her head weakly. &quot;No, it&#39;s alright. I think it&#39;s just me,&quot; she 
explained softly, the last part more to herself.

Michiru was quiet for a time, her concentration seemingly focused 
entirely on following Mamoru&#39;s car. Rei heard Minako engage Hotaru in 
idle chatter behind her, the drone of the two girls&#39; combined voices a 
pleasant background noise that, along with the steady purr of the 
convertible&#39;s engine, lulled her senses and caused her mind to drift.

&quot;Setsuna is really fond of you,&quot; Michiru said carefully out of the blue, 
keeping her eyes on the road. For some reason, Rei wasn&#39;t very surprised 
by the Senshi of the Sea&#39;s admission. The Outer Sailor Senshi did form a 
close-knit group, even more so than the Inner Senshi, to a degree.

Rei could tell that Michiru was waiting expectantly for a reaction, but 
the miko took her time in replying, appearing not at all perturbed. &quot;I 
know she does,&quot; she said without inflection.

&quot;She&#39;s very beautiful...&quot; Michiru continued cautiously, shooting the 
Senshi of Fire furtive looks. &quot;And has quite the lovely figure...&quot;

Rei flicked her eyes towards the not-so-subtle woman in the seat next to 
her. &quot;Yes, she does...&quot; she said slowly, taking care to keep her voice 
level.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t aware that Setsuna was interested in women until recently,&quot; 
Michiru went on in a contemplative tone. &quot;I wish I had known sooner; 
she&#39;s really quite a catch. I know several women who would jump at the 
chance to go out with someone like her.&quot;

Rei resisted the impulse to say that it was too bad Michiru was with 
Haruka, or she could have gone out with the Senshi of Time. &quot;Uh huh,&quot; 
the miko said instead, urging the Outer Senshi to go on with a 
nonchalant response.

&quot;And she looks very, *very* good for her age; not the slightest hint of 
wrinkles or... other signs of aging,&quot; Michiru said, continuing her 
promotion of her friend&#39;s charms. &quot;Why, she could pass for her early 
twenties.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she could.&quot;

Michiru hesitated for a second, and then finally came to the point of 
her whole conversation about Setsuna, which didn&#39;t take a genius to 
already figure out. &quot;Since it didn&#39;t work out with Usagi, perhaps you... 
and Setsuna... could...?&quot;

&quot;Setsuna put you up to this, didn&#39;t she?&quot; Rei deadpanned.

Michiru blinked innocently at the Fire Senshi before returning her gaze 
to the road. &quot;Of course not,&quot; she said, feigning astonishment.

&quot;Yeah, Setsuna isn&#39;t the type to ask someone to do such a thing,&quot; Rei 
said with a knowing smile as she watched the traffic whiz by the car. &quot;I 
guess that whole speech was your own idea, right?&quot;

Realising she was caught, Michiru smiled in resignation and let out a 
small sigh of defeat. &quot;Setsuna wouldn&#39;t admit it, but I know she has 
feelings for you,&quot; she confessed. &quot;They&#39;re as plain as day; even someone 
as aloof as Setsuna can&#39;t hide them, especially from someone who knows 
her well.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Rei whispered sadly, remembering the pain in Setsuna&#39;s eyes 
every time she was with the woman. Pain caused by her. Indirectly caused 
perhaps, but Rei still held a measure of responsibility for the Guardian 
of Time&#39;s suffering. She seemed to be good at causing other people pain. 
But then, misery did love company.

&quot;Loneliness is a terrible thing, Rei,&quot; Michiru said quietly. &quot;And for 
someone like Setsuna, even more so. For many, many, years she has been 
completely alone, with not even other Sailor Senshi for company. Her 
duty is one of the worst of all of ours; to guard the Gates of Time, for 
all time. Setsuna needs a special companion to ease the passage of that 
eternity with.&quot; The aquamarine-haired woman let out a frustrated breath, 
noticeably concerned for her friend. &quot;Even if she did find somebody, 
they would be mortal; a normal human being whose body, and subsequently 
their life, would ultimately succumb to the ravages of time. You can 
imagine how torturous it would be to continually lose someone you love 
dearly over and over again.&quot; Michiru shook her head gently, her eyes 
becoming misty as she watched the road. &quot;Sometimes I think our lives as 
Sailor Senshi are a curse. But I am thankful that Haruka and I can share 
forever together. I suppose I&#39;m lucky in that respect.&quot;

Rei inwardly agreed that Michiru was indeed fortuitous, but the miko 
didn&#39;t feel like her own life was a complete curse, despite all that had 
happened thus far. The reason for her birth in this world was to protect 
her princess, Usagi, and it was a life she gladly accepted, no matter 
what the future held.

&quot;I don&#39;t know loneliness like Setsuna does,&quot; Rei said soberly, slouching 
further back into her seat. &quot;But I can guess how hard it has been for 
her. However...&quot; The Fire Senshi looked out the windshield at the back 
window of Mamoru&#39;s car, but she could only see Ami and Makoto. Her 
princess was still just out of sight. For some reason, that brought down 
Rei&#39;s spirits even more. &quot;However, it&#39;s her fate, Michiru. She knows it, 
and... and I know it, too. There is nothing you can do for her, no 
matter how badly you want to help.&quot; Rei closed her eyes, not really 
wanting to go over the whole upsetting situation again, but doing so 
anyway. &quot;If you&#39;re asking me if I feel anything for Setsuna, then yes, I 
do. Pity. I feel pity for her, because I know what she is going through. 
But pity isn&#39;t love, and I can&#39;t live a lie for her, and I&#39;m sure she 
doesn&#39;t want to live one either.&quot; The despondent girl gave a jaded smile 
to the air, keeping her eyes shut. They burned beneath her eyelids; she 
hadn&#39;t been sleeping very well lately. &quot;Setsuna&#39;s beautiful, 
compassionate, gentle, intelligent; you would think that she would 
easily be able to find somebody to love her, even a mortal. But she 
won&#39;t. She&#39;s a slave to Fate and, I guess, a slave to her heart, if 
loves someone as hopeless as me. Setsuna&#39;s just like me. We&#39;re both 
slaves to Fate, and slaves to our hearts.&quot; Rei chuckled cynically, and 
opened her lavender eyes. &quot;It&#39;s funny; if I could only free my heart 
from Usagi, then we&#39;d both break the hold Fate has on us. I could give 
it a try with Setsuna, and she would have someone by her side. I... just 
wish...&quot; She trailed off, her voice starting to crack. Rei took a moment 
to control the rising anguish inside of her, and swallowed it back with 
some difficultly.

&quot;You really love her, don&#39;t you?&quot; Michiru whispered, more to herself 
than to the miko. &quot;Perhaps it&#39;s a gallant, romantic thing, always 
preserving your heart for someone you love,&quot; she then went on in a 
louder, but still relatively solemn, tone.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Rei said, not really believing it. &quot;But all the gallantry in 
the world doesn&#39;t lessen any of the pain.&quot; The Senshi of Fire suddenly 
shook her head in mild anger. &quot;Damn it, I sound like a martyr.&quot;

&quot;You are,&quot; Michiru said, causing Rei to look at her sharply. &quot;You&#39;ve 
made a sacrifice. You&#39;re willingly suffering for a loved one.&quot;

&quot;I guess...&quot; Rei said uncomfortably, never really having liked being 
referred to as a martyr. It conjured up the image of someone moaning and 
whining about all the troubles they willing took on for the greater 
good. A better person would simply stoically take it without complaint. 
She supposed that was the difference between a martyr, and a hero. But 
then, she didn&#39;t like being referred to as a hero either. &quot;And Usagi 
isn&#39;t just someone I love; she&#39;s my true love, my first and only. There 
have been crushes, sure, but nothing even approaching the intensity of 
the love I have for her.&quot;

&quot;What about during the Silver Millennium?&quot; Michiru inquired. &quot;I was 
under the impression all the Inner Sailor Senshi had close relationships 
with the Prince of Earth&#39;s personal bodyguard.&quot;

&quot;My memories of that time are still fragmented,&quot; Rei explained, her brow 
creasing in concentration as she tried to recollect the tattered events 
of her life during a time long past. &quot;I know I had some sort of 
relationship with Jadeite, but it was like... it was like I was merely 
filling a void for something, and going along with the others. And I&#39;m 
certain it never came even remotely close to the scope of the love I 
have for Usagi. I was charged with guarding the Moon Princess, and 
Jadeite was charged with guarding the Prince of Earth. The other Inner 
Senshi all found a partner in the prince&#39;s bodyguard, so it was more or 
less expected I would too. I guess it put everything in a neat little 
package if each and every member of the princess&#39;s personal bodyguard 
were involved with one member of the prince&#39;s,&quot; she finished acidly in a 
bitter sneer.

&quot;It seems that you and Setsuna have more in common than I first 
believed,&quot; Michiru commented sadly, giving the Fire Senshi a short 
sympathetic look before refocusing her attention on driving. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Rei. It would have been nice if you and Setsuna could have tried it 
together, but I see someone else holds your heart. Or rather, imprisons 
it.&quot;

Rei gave a faint half-smile to Michiru&#39;s profile. &quot;No, my heart isn&#39;t 
imprisoned. Someone&#39;s just taking care of it for me.&quot; The Senshi of 
Fire&#39;s smile then turned into a smirk. &quot;Besides, me and Setsuna? Heh, I 
like blondes,&quot; she joked, her lavender eyes twinkling with humour and... 
acceptance.

Michiru let out a polite laugh and glanced at Rei. &quot;As long as you stay 
away from *my* blonde, then we won&#39;t have a problem,&quot; she said with a 
small, teasing smile. &quot;...But, we do have another blonde who&#39;s available 
and just so happens to be in the backseat of this car at this very 
minute...&quot; she added with false innocence, eyeing Rei slyly.

&quot;Minako?&quot; Rei said, and then shook her head with a smile gracing her 
lips. &quot;Nah, I don&#39;t think so.&quot;

&quot;What? Did you call me?&quot; the girl in question asked from the backseat, 
leaning forward to poke her head in between Rei and Michiru.

&quot;No, Minako,&quot; Rei said in a longsuffering way.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Minako,&quot; Michiru chimed in. &quot;Go back to talking to 
Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, okay,&quot; the Senshi of Love said a little uncertainly, looking 
between the miko and the aquamarine-haired woman with suspicion. &quot;...You 
aren&#39;t talking about me, are you?&quot;

&quot;No, Minako,&quot; Rei repeated in a similar tone as before, rolling her 
eyes.

Minako continued to glance at her two fellow Sailor Senshi for a couple 
of seconds more, and then fell back into her seat again. &quot;Okay. But I&#39;ll 
find out if you were, you know,&quot; she threatened. &quot;And then I&#39;ll punish 
you in the name of Venus! You&#39;ll be sorry!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Minako,&quot; Rei said, mimicking her previous tone and grinning at 
Michiru, who smiled conspiringly back.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you haven&#39;t lost your sense of humour,&quot; Michiru remarked after 
awhile as she indicated to the right and followed Mamoru&#39;s car down a 
quiet, seemingly deserted street where some of Tokyo&#39;s tall corporate 
office buildings resided.

&quot;The day I lose my witty sense of humour is the day I truly die,&quot; Rei 
smiled.

Michiru opened her mouth to no doubt give a witty response of her own, 
but stopped in mid breath. She frowned marginally as she looked in the 
rear view mirror. &quot;I&#39;m not entirely certain, but I think someone is 
tailing us.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rei said.

&quot;The blue compact a couple of cars behind has been following us for 
quite some time now,&quot; Michiru informed the Fire Senshi as she spared 
several apprehensive glances in the mirror.

&quot;Youma?&quot; Minako questioned from the backseat, having overheard the 
conversation.

&quot;Worse,&quot; Rei grumbled as she looked surreptitiously behind her at the 
occupants of the shadowing car. &quot;Idiots with a death wish.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s too late to lose them, whoever they are,&quot; Michiru informed the 
girls as she pulled up to the curb behind Mamoru&#39;s red car containing 
their comrades. &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;

******

&quot;Ah, crap! She&#39;s coming this way!&quot; Sanjuro exclaimed as he slapped 
Tsubasa&#39;s arm in a panic and looked with frightened eyes as a darkly 
dressed Rei approached their parked car, the girl&#39;s long hair and coat 
flapping behind her in the cold wind. &quot;Quick, hide, you fool!&quot;

Tsubasa looked to his left and then looked to his right as his flustered 
mind tried to find a suitable hiding spot... until he realised just 
where he was. &quot;Uh, where?!&quot; he squeaked out as Rei, the Sailor Senshi of 
hot, blistering, face searing fire came ever closer. Damn Sanjuro, 
Tsubasa knew he had been following the miko and her friends too closely. 
Some great driver he was.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, just duck, god damn it!&quot; Sanjuro hissed, doing just that.

However, before Tsubasa could do likewise, there was a sharp rap on the 
window beside him. The brown-haired man slowly creaked his head around 
to the passenger side window, meeting the inevitable. He smiled weakly 
at Rei&#39;s pretty face framed by the car&#39;s window, as his own unsightly 
face drained of colour. That is, if it hadn&#39;t been burnt a painful red. 
However, Rei&#39;s expression didn&#39;t seem very angry, it was more curious 
and a little anxious. Tsubasa blinked uncertainty and then fumbled for 
the button to open the window.

Once the window had been opened fully, Rei let out a weary sigh. &quot;You 
guys shouldn&#39;t be here; it&#39;s dangerous,&quot; she said, glancing at the still 
cowering Sanjuro for a second. The raven-haired girl then refocused her 
gaze on Tsubasa and frowned in puzzlement. &quot;What happened to your face?&quot;

&quot;He stayed in the sun too long,&quot; Sanjuro cut in quickly as he sat up 
from his &#39;hiding spot&#39;, answering Rei before Tsubasa could even open his 
mouth. &quot;You aren&#39;t mad at us?&quot; the ex-reporter then asked tentatively, 
looking ready to bolt from the car if the response was not to his 
liking.

&quot;I don&#39;t like getting stalked by a couple of annoying men,&quot; Rei with 
some force, making Sanjuro recoil and Tsubasa gulp. &quot;But it&#39;s not 
important right now. I can yell at you both later. Right now, just get 
lost for your own safety.&quot;

&quot;I knew it!&quot; Sanjuro shouted elatedly, grinning in triumph. &quot;Youma! 
There&#39;s youma here! And you and your pals are about to bring major beat 
down on them!&quot; The ex-investigative reporter&#39;s expression then turned 
sneaky, his happy grin becoming sly. &quot;Or should I say you and your 
*Sailor Senshi* pals...&quot;

Rei tensed where she leant down to the car window, her skinned knuckles 
turning white as she gripped the frame harder, and Tsubasa prayed that 
she wouldn&#39;t have to silence him and his loudmouthed companion 
permanently, or do anything that involved experiencing physical pain. 
But as quickly as her muscles tightened, the Sailor of Fire relaxed and 
shook her head gently in grudging acceptance.

&quot;I suppose it was obvious,&quot; she sighed in resignation. Rei looked back 
to her companions who had assembled outside the two cars, all of whom 
were watching her expectantly. Tsubasa saw that Usagi and her boyfriend 
were among their number. &quot;But it changes nothing,&quot; Rei continued, 
turning back to the window. &quot;It&#39;s not safe for the two of you to remain 
here; there&#39;s a risk the fight could spill out onto the streets.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a risk we&#39;re willing to take,&quot; Tsubasa stated resolutely, folding 
his arms and nodding firmly. &quot;After all, in the end, it is our choice to 
make.&quot;

&quot;Damn straight,&quot; Sanjuro added, and then puffed out his chest. &quot;Our 
courage knows no bounds! ...Anyway, I need pictures.&quot; He waved his 
camera at Rei.

The miko narrowed her eyes at the two men and stared at them intensely 
for a few moments. Tsubasa swallowed uneasily and felt himself start to 
nervously perspire. Eventually, Rei stood up and looked over her 
shoulder at something across the street, and then to her friends, before 
she simply looked straight ahead.

&quot;Idiots,&quot; Tsubasa heard her breathe. She leaned back down to the car 
window and looked at the vehicle&#39;s occupants sternly. &quot;If you want to be 
stubborn numbskulls, then fine,&quot; Rei said, causing Sanjuro to let out a 
whoop of joy. &quot;But you don&#39;t budge from this spot, understand? *Don&#39;t*. 
*Follow*. *Me*,&quot; the Senshi of Fire ordered strictly, glaring hard at 
Tsubasa and Sanjuro.

&quot;We won&#39;t, Rei,&quot; Tsubasa assured the girl.

Rei moved her gaze to Sanjuro. &quot;And no pictures, camera boy.&quot;

&quot;Aww, come on!&quot; Sanjuro protested loudly. &quot;What the hell&#39;s the point in 
staying then?&quot;

&quot;So go home,&quot; Rei said unsympathetically, raising a challenging and 
elegant eyebrow.

&quot;Fine, no pictures,&quot; Sanjuro consented with clear reluctance, tossing 
his camera belligerently on the dashboard.

&quot;Good. And if I even hear the hint of something that sounds like a 
camera shutter clicking...&quot; Rei threatened, presenting a balled fist to 
the ex-reporter, her warning of violence obvious.

&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Sanjuro acquiesced, holding out his hands in a motion of 
passivism. &quot;Since it&#39;s you asking, Sailor Mars. Anyone else I&#39;d tell to 
take a hike.&quot;

Rei smirked. &quot;I feel privileged,&quot; she said dryly.

&quot;Come on, Rei, what&#39;s taking so long?&quot; Tsubasa heard a girl&#39;s voice 
call.

The miko glanced at her waiting friends and then back inside the car. 
&quot;Gotta go, guys,&quot; she said grimly. &quot;Stay out of trouble,&quot; she then added 
after a slight pause. And with that, Rei stood up and jogged back to her 
comrades.

Tsubasa watched Rei leave and join up with her impatient friends. She 
looked tired. He hoped she was getting enough rest. It had to be 
difficult for a girl as young as Rei to have to face the kinds of 
nightmarish creatures Tsubasa had seen. She was still just a teenager. 
Tsubasa wondered how long Rei had been a defender of good and a fighter 
of evil. It seemed cruel and unfair that she had been roped into such a 
hard life. Why would people so young be chosen to protect the world? But 
Rei appeared to enjoy her lot in life at any rate, or at least, accept 
it. Still... it had to take a lot of bravery to stand against the 
horrors Rei had to deal with. Tsubasa wondered why she did it. There was 
no real reward beyond the mere satisfaction of fighting the good fight, 
and possibly the fame, but then Rei&#39;s true identity did remain secret 
from the public. Perhaps that was enough though; the simple satisfaction 
of knowing what she was doing was right. Some people were just 
inherently good, Tsubasa supposed. And also, in life or death 
situations, which Rei was constantly thrown into, people&#39;s true 
characters tended to reveal themselves, be it one of a coward, or one of 
a hero. But, the depressing fact was, the cowards tended to live longer. 
All that faced every hero was the cold hard grave eventually.

&quot;Come on; I wanna watch this,&quot; Sanjuro said as he got out of the car, 
interrupting Tsubasa&#39;s disturbing reverie.

Tsubasa followed suit and directed his attention to the eight people 
several metres in the distance as he sat on the car&#39;s bonnet. There was 
a brief exchange of words between them, mostly between Rei and the 
others. Tsubasa noticed a tall brunette and a blonde girl with a red 
ribbon in her hair point in his general direction while they spoke 
heatedly to Rei, to which the miko responded by waving one hand casually 
and shrugging her shoulders. A beautiful aquamarine-haired women, who 
looked older than the other girls, smiled faintly and then said 
something to the group, which seemed to diffuse the situation somewhat. 
The brunette nodded and the blonde with the ribbon shrugged 
indifferently, and then looked at where Tsubasa and Sanjuro were 
observing for a second. All of a sudden, the tall brunette held up a 
pen-like object above her head, and then shouted out a phrase that 
echoed around the area strangely, as if the words held some sort of 
important, powerful, significance.

&quot;JUPITER CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

As Tsubasa watched, the figure of a normally dressed girl was replaced 
in a split second by a similar girl dressed in a peculiar style of fuku, 
not unlike a special uniform of sorts, akin to the one he had seen Rei 
wear before. Just as his mind began to comprehend that the girl was 
indeed the same brunette who had arrived with Rei but now transformed, 
the rest of the girls yelled out their own versions of the magical 
phrase.

&quot;MERCURY CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;VENUS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;MARS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;NEPTUNE PLANET POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;SATURN PLANET POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;MOON COSMIC POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;Awesome!&quot; Sanjuro cried with glee at the spectacle unfolding before 
him. &quot;This is amazing!&quot; He gestured excitedly at a thin, dark-haired 
girl, who looked the youngest of the team, and who Tsubasa also 
recognised from the mansion explosion a while back. However this time, 
while the girl still had a frail, pale, form, she exuded an aura of icy 
menace. The long pole graced with a shiny curved blade at one end that 
she wielded didn&#39;t help her image either. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen that Sailor 
Senshi before!&quot; Sanjuro said, nearly hopping up and down with 
exhilaration at being allowed to witness a rare display for the public 
eye.

Tsubasa moved his gaze to where Rei had been standing, and saw that the 
miko was now decked out in the red and white fuku of Sailor Mars. He 
couldn&#39;t help the flutter in his heart as he looked on in awe at the 
magnificent portrait of splendour, getting a clear impression of the 
Senshi of Fire in all her glory for the first time. In Tsubasa&#39;s eyes, 
Sailor Mars was the most beautiful of all the senshi. But, he could make 
out the small flaws in her intrepid and exquisite bearing; the trace of 
dark circles under her eyes, the not quite so glossy sheen on her raven 
locks, her rather pale complexion, and the slightly fevered, desperate 
look in her lavender eyes as she looked up at a tall office building 
across the street.

Tsubasa slumped his shoulders and lowered his now heavy head. So 
something indeed had happened between Rei and Usagi. There could be no 
doubt; there was only one thing that could make the normally fiery girl 
appear this way. Tsubasa raised his head and flicked his eyes over to 
where Usagi --or rather Sailor Moon if his knowledge was correct-- was 
standing, the blonde looking glumly at Mars as she tried to meet her 
gaze, but to no avail. Sailor Mars seemed engrossed in looking up at the 
skyscraper and didn&#39;t notice Sailor Moon vying for her attention. But 
then at long last, Mars turned her head to Sailor Moon and smiled at the 
girl. However, the smile was strained and tremulous, even to Tsubasa who 
was a fair distance away.

&quot;&#39;Love that we cannot have, is the one that lasts the longest, hurts the 
deepest, and feels the strongest&#39;,&quot; Sanjuro quoted sagely from out of 
nowhere. Tsubasa turned to the man, and saw that he was also watching 
Mars. Seeing the completely and utterly dumbfounded expression stuck on 
Tsubasa&#39;s face at his wise words, Sanjuro shrugged absently. &quot;I&#39;m a 
journalist; I have a billion of &#39;em.&quot;

Tsubasa continued to simply stare at the ex-reporter in astonishment for 
a few more seconds, unable to break his features out of their stunned 
rictus. Perhaps Sanjuro&#39;s brain wasn&#39;t just filled with crazy fantasies 
and self-centred thoughts.

&quot;Maybe we should get back in the car; if any youma come flying out I 
want to be able to get the hell outta here, pronto,&quot; Sanjuro then said, 
slipping off of the car&#39;s hood and walking back to the driver&#39;s side. &quot;I 
don&#39;t want to be ripped to shreds and then chewed up by some hungry 
monster. That&#39;s what the Sailor Senshi are there for; let them handle 
the evil, homicidal, brain-eating, youma.&quot;

Tsubasa sighed and shook his head. Of course, he could be wrong about 
his assumptions of the contents of Sanjuro&#39;s brain. The brown-haired man 
looked back to Sailor Mars as she and the other Sailor Senshi, plus one 
rather formally dressed man in a white mask, began to cross the street 
to the building the miko had been staring at so intently before.

&quot;Be careful...&quot; Tsubasa whispered to the departing Senshi of Fire.

&quot;I just bet the big bad is on the very top floor,&quot; Sailor Venus 
complained as she stared up at the twenty-storey skyscraper.

&quot;I think it&#39;s based on the leader appearing superior to their 
underlings,&quot; Mercury commented contemplatively. &quot;It forms a stronger 
image of power, and hence, control.&quot;

&quot;The elevators better be working, that&#39;s all I can say...&quot; Venus said 
dryly.

Sailor Mars listened to her friends&#39; exchange absently, her mind focused 
more on finding and recovering the object that could provide her with a 
second chance at happiness in her dismal life. And slaying the object&#39;s 
current owner. The Senshi of Fire felt Tsubasa and Sanjuro&#39;s eyes on her 
back, but the two men were far from her thoughts. While their presence 
had been a mild upset to her fellow senshi, there was no point in 
worrying about them knowing what the majority of the Sailors, and not to 
mention Tuxedo Kamen, looked like normally. No, there was far more 
important and immediate concerns that occupied the miko&#39;s mind. Sailor 
Mars narrowed her eyes to determined slits as she stared through the 
front glass wall of the office building and into the large ground floor 
lobby. It looked perfectly quiet, not even the slightest sign of 
movement to be seen. That just screamed out danger.

&quot;Looks clear,&quot; Sailor Jupiter remarked uneasily as she and the others 
gathered around the entrance to Lazarus&#39; designated meeting place. &quot;Too 
clear.&quot;

Mars shook her head while she kept her gaze fixed on the apparently 
empty lobby. She agreed with Jupiter. The moment she and her companions 
all took one footstep in that building, youma would be coming out of the 
woodwork.

&quot;We should still be cautious,&quot; Sailor Moon suggested as she looked 
ominously inside the corporate office building. &quot;Don&#39;t let your guard 
down.&quot;

Sailor Mars angled her head upwards, noting the two sets of elevators 
dead centre in the far wall in respect to the main entrance, and also 
taking heed of the two first-storey balconies on either side of the 
front doors, positioned a few metres to the rear. Her lavender eyes 
flicked to the lobby&#39;s large curved front desk to the right, and then to 
a couple of couches and armchairs arranged around a rectangular coffee 
table off to the left. Besides some pot plants placed periodically along 
the walls, there was no other furniture to speak of on the lobby&#39;s grey 
polished tile floor.

&quot;What is it, Mars?&quot; Sailor Moon asked her bodyguard quietly from 
slightly behind and to the left of the raven-haired girl.

&quot;It&#39;s pretty sparse,&quot; she explained slowly, revealing her thoughts about 
the environment&#39;s layout as they came to her. &quot;We&#39;re going to be very 
vulnerable as soon as we go in.&quot;

&quot;The balconies are going to be a problem too,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen said from 
Sailor Mars&#39; far left, on the other side of her princess.

Mars nodded in agreement as her mind continued to mull over the 
situation. &quot;If they&#39;re smart, they&#39;ll use the elevation to their 
advantage. Any projectiles will have full cover of the entire area from 
that high angle.&quot;

&quot;I guess we stay low, and if things get hairy, maximise what cover there 
is,&quot; Sailor Venus said, offering her opinions on strategies.

&quot;Easier said than done,&quot; Sailor Neptune breathed as she put a thoughtful 
finger on her chin. &quot;There&#39;s not much to work with.&quot;

&quot;No choice,&quot; Sailor Jupiter sighed as she rubbed the back of her head.

Sailor Mars leaned back a little and then turned her head towards Sailor 
Moon&#39;s ear. &quot;Stay close to me,&quot; she whispered gravely to her true love, 
the miko&#39;s lips barely moving as to not be noticed by Tuxedo Kamen. She 
didn&#39;t want the man to think she was moving in on his territory again.

Sailor Moon looked at Sailor Mars with worried blue eyes and then nodded 
apprehensively, much to the miko&#39;s relief. The Fire Senshi still had her 
duty to protect her princess at all costs; nothing would ever change 
that fact. She was glad that Sailor Moon hadn&#39;t hesitated in conceding 
to her instructions.

&quot;It&#39;s getting quite cold out here,&quot; Sailor Neptune said 
matter-of-factly, a small smile coming to her features. &quot;What do you say 
we get indoors?&quot; Everyone else agreed that it was a good idea.

Sailor Mars felt adrenaline being shot into her bloodstream as Sailor 
Venus took the point, carefully pushing open the glass double doors to 
the office building that the youma enemy had been so kind to leave 
unlocked. Sailor Moon stayed close to the Senshi of Fire&#39;s side as the 
raven-haired girl followed behind Sailor Mercury and Sailor Jupiter, the 
whistling of her comrades&#39; edgy and shallow breathing the only nearby 
sounds. As Mars&#39; red heels clicked on the hard tiled floor of the lobby, 
she knew there was no turning back. If there ever was. Lazarus was 
somewhere in this building, and with the youma assassin, the mask that 
could see each individual thread of the near future timeline. How she 
was to defeat him Sailor Mars still had no real idea, but she would find 
a way. If not for herself, then for Sailor Moon, her princess and love. 
At the very least, with the mask, Sailor Mars could protect the blonde 
odango atama utterly from any danger and pain the world threatened to 
throw at her angel. The Senshi of Fire would finally be an infallible 
guardian, and never fail her princess again. Of course, there was the 
other, more obvious reason for winning the mask; use it to repair her 
relationship and love with Sailor Moon, and finally get the destiny she 
so yearned for. Mars knew it was a selfish use for the artefact, but the 
pain of longing in her heart would not let the option rest in her mind. 
But first, she had to hunt down Lazarus and kill any youma in her path. 
All while protecting Sailor Moon. The blonde&#39;s life was still in 
potential jeopardy, and Sailor Mars had not forgotten Setsuna&#39;s 
unsettling portent of the future. It seemed like ages ago that the 
Guardian of Time had warned her, but now, tonight, the miko felt more 
restless about it than ever. She couldn&#39;t help but start to think that 
maybe Setsuna&#39;s &#39;moment&#39; and her vision from the Fire were related 
somehow. Exactly how, she wasn&#39;t sure. There was just something in the 
air tonight. It was electrifying, like ozone before the coming lightning 
strike, like a sense of expectancy, a tense anticipation that held the 
entire universe&#39;s rapt attention. She could almost taste it; a tart, 
acrid, unpleasant taste.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

Okay, so nothing much happened. I decided to split the chapter up into 
two parts, and have the violence component in the next chapter. It just 
didn&#39;t feel right tacking it on to the extra angst in this chapter. No, 
this isn&#39;t a pathetic attempt to reach sixty chapters before the fanfic 
ends. ^_^</pre>
