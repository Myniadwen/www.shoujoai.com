<h1>A First Time for Everything</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ldrews.html">Larry Drews</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        What you are about to read is a work of fiction.  This is a Hentai-
Etchii-Lemon work.  This is my first major attempt at writing such things,
any comments good or bad are welcome.  I hope you enjoy reading this,
I was trying for something a bit  different than your usual &quot;H&quot; story,
and I hope it shows.  I will NOT declare that this story with inflict
any discomfort on anyone&#39;s body  parts.  What you do on your own time is
your own business.
        This story is set while the Sailor&#39;s were enjoying thier time on
the private island Rei was hiding out on in the original R series.  While
Chibi-Usa is mentioned, she DOES NOT take part in any of the antics.  I
just wanted to make that clear.  I apologize for any spelling and/or
grammatical errors.  If there are enough favarable responses, I might
do more.

------------------------------------------------------------

        Usagi walked through the brush of the small tropical island. When
Minako, Makoto, Ami and herself thought a few days ago to come out here
and see what Rei was up too, all she planned to do was swim, catch some
sun, and hang out with the girls.  Unfortunately Chibi-Usa came along,
and the incident with the volcano and the.... dinosaurs kind of threw a
monkey wrench in the plans.
        Now, she didn&#39;t hate the child.  In fact she often worried about
the small girl.  But today Usagi had enough of her, and everyone for that
matter  Three days had passed since their arrival and she wanted a little
time by herself.  It seemed that every one of them wanted a bit of
privacy, peace and quiet today.  So each of them decided that they would
go off and do something by themselves.
        All Usagi wanted to do now was to find a secluded place to lay her
towel, and catch some sun.  Even though she had been there a few days,
her skin was still as white as when she came.  She wanted to get some
color to her.  She figured it might make her look a bit more appealing to
her beloved Mamoru.
        Why had he turned her away?  It couldn&#39;t have been her age. She
knew that for sure.  Was it because of her looks? No, she knew she wasn&#39;t
a goddess, but she knew she was attractive.  Other boys showed interest
in her.  But they were all nothing compared to her Mamo-chan.  Maybe is
was her lack of maturity?  She couldn&#39;t help it if acted like a normal 15
year old girl.  She was acting her age, at least she thought she was.
&quot;Oh stop thinking about it for once, girl!&quot; She yelled at herself, and
continued to work her way through the bushes.
        She remembered leaving Rei, Ami, and Chibi-Usa back at the beach
house.  Rei had decided to go back to practicing her Miko skills. Ami,
who was never far from her books decided to study, but that was no
surprise to anyone else.  And the last she saw of Chibi-Usa was her and
the Luna-P building sand castles on the beach.  It was weird, it just
seemed that for once, everyone wanted to do their own thing and be by
themselves.
        Minako and Mako-chan had left before her.  Mako-chan had her
fishing gear and said she was gonna go catch some lunch for everyone.
Usagi licked her lips in anticipation of what Mako-chan would prepare for
them..
        As for Minako.  Like Usagi, she grabbed her towel, some sun
screen, a magazine, and headed off to be alone.  Usagi often found it
strange how much her and Minako though alike.  Usagi was almost becoming
lost in her thoughts until she heard something.... Running water?
        She followed the sound until she could see a natural pool through
the bushes. It was about the size of her schools swimming pool. A small
misty waterfall tumbled over large bolders than had been worn smooth from
years of erosion on them. And the mist from the waterfall made a small
rainbow as the sun refracted through the tiny droplets.  An abundant
supply of flora bloomed around the edge. The midday sun shot a beam of
light that illuminated the pool, and some of the shore around it.  It was
one of the most beautiful sights she had ever seen.  &quot;This is the perfect
spot.&quot; She said quietly to herself.
        As she was just about to step into the clearing, she noticed that
the water was rippling from rising air bubbles.  Something was coming up
to the surface. &quot;Not another dinosaur, I hope.&quot; She stepped back and
crouched down behind a bush, and watched between the branches.  When the
surface of the water was breached, Minako&#39;s form was what surfaced.
Apparently Minako had found this tropical garden first.  Usagi pouted a
bit. &quot;Well, first come first served, as the saying goes.&quot; She thought in
her head.
        Usagi watched her for a minute.  She did feel a bit ashamed of
herself, spying on a friend like that.  She didn&#39;t know if she should
make her presence known or not.  But she at least wanted to wait until
she got an oppurtune moment to sneak away unseen.   She was also a tad
jealous, Minako having this little bit of heaven to herself.  As she
watched her friend for another minute, she began to notice something.
Minako was nude?  Was she?  No, Minako may be a show off, but she
wouldn&#39;t swim nude in a place like this, would she?  Usagi was now
curious, she had to know now.  So she kept very still and watched.
        Minako was swimming the breast stroke from one side of the pool to
the other, doing laps.  Minako let out a small luagh as she glided from
side to side of the pool barely causing a wake.  She almost seemed at
home with the water, like a mermaid of mythology.  Usagi couldn&#39;t tell
one way or the other if her friend was clothed or not because of her bad
angle of vision.  Also, Minako&#39;s long golden hair was doing a good job of
hiding any view of her suits neck straps.  That was until Minako dove
down again.  Usagi saw it plain as day.  Minako&#39;s naked bottom.  She was
able to notice the tan lines on her skin.  She had seen enough, and
quickly sped away so as to give her friend the privacy she wanted.
        After a while, she found a small hill.  She walked up it, and at
the top was a clearing that over looked the ocean.  It was a breath
taking view of the sea.  This clearing seemed just as secluded as the one
Minako had found.  It may not have had the pool, but the view she got of
the surrounding area and ocean was more than made up for it.
        &quot;This is the place.&quot; She said as she laid out her towel and pulled
out her stuff from the bag she kept it in.  She removed her T-shirt and
denim shorts.  She was wearing a very skimpy string bikini underneath.
that left nothing to the imagination, but it would allow her to get the
best tan possible.  She was usually a bit more modest, but since she was
alone modesty didn&#39;t matter much to her right now..  Though she did
think, &quot;I wonder what Mamo-chan would say if he saw me in this?&quot;  She
laughed lightly.
        Usagi sat down on the towel and applied the sun screen to her
body.  She wanted a tan, but she didn&#39;t want to end up looking like a
boiled red lobster. As she rubbed the lotion on, her thoughts wandered
back to Minako.
        &quot;I wonder what made her do that?&quot; she thought in her head. &quot;I
mean, is it any different than being in at the hot sulphur springs, or
bathhouse?  I wonder what it feels like to swim nude like that?&quot;
        Usagi shook her head. &quot;What am I thinking?&quot; and continued applying
the lotion. &quot;I mean, Minako has such a beautiful body.  So I guess she
isn&#39;t ashamed to show it off.&quot;  Usagi had always been just a tad jealous
of Minako&#39;s body. Mako-chan and Minako both seemed to have blossomed
further than the rest of the girls, and both of them on occasion had
fluanted it to their advantage.  She finished her legs and she took
notice.  &quot;My legs are just as nice as hers.&quot; She rubbed some on her arms
and shoulders. &quot;And I&#39;m in pretty good shape.&quot;  She then worked her chest
and stomach. &quot;I&#39;m a pretty good example of womanhood.&quot;  That&#39;s when she
noticed the size of her breasts.  &quot;Ok, so some parts still need a little
work.&quot;
        She was about lay back, when a thought entered her head. The
thought was something she hadn&#39;t considered before, and probably wouldn&#39;t
have if she hadn&#39;t seen Minako skinny dipping.  &quot;Well...no one else is
about.  Rei, Ami and Chibi-Usa are back at house.  Mako-chan is fishing
on the other side of the island. And Minako is doing her thing.  Who
would see me?&quot;  She pondered this for about another minute and came up
with an answewr. &quot;No one.&quot; And she would be able to hear someone coming
through the bushes.
        She sat back up, took a deep breath, reached behind her back, and
undid the bottom strings.  She then did the same with the top strings.
The top of the bikini fell from her bosom and into her lap.  She
instantly felt the warm sun on the skin of her bosom. She leaned back on
her hands, and let the sun beat down on her for a few minutes.  She
enjoyed the warmth on her skin, as she looked down at herself and smiled.
&quot;That wasn&#39;t so hard.&quot;  she picked up the top and set it aside.
        The next step took a bit more bravery.  She laid back down, hooked
her fingers on either side of the bikini briefs, arched her back to lift
her toosh a little, and slid the bikini bottoms down to her knees.  She
settled her bare bottom down on the towel, lifted her legs up and pulled
the biniki off, and set it down next to the top.
        She laid there for a minute, feeling the warm glow of the sun on
her entire body.  She felt warm all over.  But it was more of a wamrth
that came from the inside.  She became more and more comfortable with her
surroudings, and with herself as she laid there.  The tension of her
apprehension was fading fast.  &quot;There, nothing to it.&quot; she laughed to
herself.
        As she laid there for about 20 minutes, she streched out her arms
and legs and rolled side to side on the large towel. She was enjoying her
nudity, and she began to understand why Minako might enjoy this kind of
thing.  She felt a new kind of freedom with herself.  And she was going
to get a full body tan lying in the sun like this too.
        After a few more minutes, she noticed parts of her body were
warmer than others. &quot;DOH!&quot; she yelled.  She had forgotten to apply the
sun screen where the bikini had covered.  Lord knows that&#39;s the last
place she needed a sunburn.  But it was still far from too late.  So she
grabbed the bottle of CoppertoneAA, dabbed some of the oil in her hand a
nd
began to rub it on her chest and then onto her breasts.
        The next thing she felt was a tingling sensation that shot through
her strong enough to make her gasp. &quot;Wha.. What was that?&quot; raced in her
mind.  She continued to rub her breast.  The feeling inside her was
growing.  A warm tingly feeling.  She didn&#39;t know what it was, but she
knew it happened when she rubbed her breasts, and she kinda liked it.
        She cupped one of her round breasts in her hand.  Her hand was
just big enough to cover the firm mound.  Her eyes fluttered, and she
moaned softly as she gently squueezed her breast with her fingertips.
Usagi began to feel something happening to her breasts, she looked down
to see that her nipples were becoming stiff.  When she touched one, the
feeling she had before was now ten fold. It went straight through her
body like a little jolt of electricity  Something inside had been
awakened, and it let her know it.
        Almost by instinct, her fingers began to flutter across the
nipple.  She could tell from the way they felt, they were hard and erect.
Each time a fingertip touched her there, she felt that wonderful jolt in
her body.  She put some of the lotion in her other hand, laid back on the
towel and began to massage her other breasts. The intense stimuli of
rubbing both breasts, and fluttering her fingers on the nipples made her
coo softly and arch her back off the towel.
        &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; drifted in her mind as she felt, and
enjoyed all these new sesations.  &quot;I feel so light.&quot;  Her fingers were
know kneading her firm mounds.  Her body was becoming warmer, but not
from the sun, from her mounting passions.  Her body started sway on the
towel as she began to lose control of herself.  She was starting to
lightly pinch her nipples in her fingers, gently rolling them between her
thumb and index fingers.  This caused something down between her thighs
to also let her know, it wanted attention.  She didn&#39;t feel it at first,
but when her thighs rubbed together from her swaying, she felt it....she
felt it real good.
        The feeling between her thighs made her sit straight up, and make
her legs spread in a V shaped.  She looked down, and saw how swollen and
red her nipples were.  They were now too sensitive to touch.  She wanted
to, but each time she tried to it was almost painful.  So, her attention
was drawn to what was happening down below.  What had caused such an
incredible feeling?
        She lightly touched her inner things, and noticed that there was a
dampness to them. &quot;Where did that come from?&quot; She also noticed that
touching her thighs gave another pleasurable feeling.  Again instinct
took over as she gently tickled her thighs.  She lightly giggled as she
felt her fingertips dance on her skin, and she was becomeing quite
commfortable and relaxed with this.  That&#39;s when her fingers touched her
spot. That special spot that made her a girl, and this feeling by far was
her favorite.
        She continued running her fingers across the edges of her
girlhood.  She noticed the edges were a bit swollen, and that the
dampness she had felt on her thighs was coming from there.  She leaned
back again, her legs still spread out.  She continued to gently massage
the outersides of her sex.  She was in pure heaven.  She had never felt
anything like this in her life.  It was a feeling of warmth, passion, and
energy.  She wanted more, and that just what she got as her finger
slipped past her labia and touched her now swollen clitoris.
        Usagi had learned quickly that each new sensation she felt was
stronger than last the farther she went on.  She carefully parted her
labia with one hand, and used the fingers of the other to lightly rub her
now throbbing clit.
        She gasped deeply as her fingers touched the swollen organ.  She
had never felt anything more intense in her life.  But she was hungry for
more, and she began to rub it, and stroke it.  She was panting lighty
now, and light a sweat had broken out on her body.
        As her passion grew, her body began to arch up off the towel. She
felt something building in her, she couldn&#39;t control herself anymore.
Her fingers were diligently fluttering her love button while her other
hand was massaging her labia.  She was becoming like a hungry animal,
small grunts came from her as she clentched her teeth.
        She began to feel and probe around her girlhood.  Feeling the damp
warmth of her sex.  Her fingertips passed by her vagina.  The stimuli
made her arch her whole body off the towel and made her gasp loudly.  She
stopped for a moment and again circled a finger around her vagina.  She
bit her lower lip and slowly began to slide a finger into herself.
        She only got her finger up to her second knuckle before the
tightness of her virginity kept her from proceeding.  She rubbed her
finger on the inside walls of herself.  Insticts as old as time made  her
body move up and down.  She was mentally grinding her herself against her
hand as though she was being penetrated by a man.
        Her finger began to slide in and out of herself, and her thumb
rubbed her now throbbing clitoris.  Her body was raised in a high arc as
she seemed to be humping the sky itself.  Her sex was obcenely displayed
as she ground against herself.  Anyone who walked up would have seen her
plain as day.  But she didn&#39;t care, she just kept grinding away.
        Then all at once, a wave passed over her entire body.  She felt
muscles contract and tighten in her body.  Then everything released at
once.  She could not describe the feeling that washed though her.  She
didn&#39;t know if it was pain or pleasure.  All she knew was that it was an
incredible feeling.  Nothing like she had ever felt before, and she let
out a small cry of pleasure.
        She was forced to stop after a few more seconds.  The feeling was
getting a bit uncomfortable. She laid on her towel quietly, and she
noticed that her thighs were very wet, and slightly sticky.  Had that
come from her?  That&#39;s when she realized what she had just done... She
had experienced her first orgasm.  She didn&#39;t know if she should be
scared, or proud?  She also wondered what would happen if she went back
to the house like this? She didn&#39;t have time to think about it for long
because her heart jumped when she heard a twig snap from behind her.
        She whirled around in a panic, grabbing the towel and covering
herself with it.  &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; she yelled out frightened.
        &quot;Nothing to be scared of, Princess.&quot; Came a voice from the bushes.
She knew that voice.
        &quot;Minako-chan?&quot; Usagi asked nervously.
        Minako stepped out of the bushes.  She was in a T-shirt, and
sandals.  She must have just come out of the water, because her hair was
still dripping wet, and the white T-shirt she wore clung to her wet body.
 She was nude under it as the wet T-shirt was practically transparent and
left nothing to the imagination.
        &quot;Are you alright, Usagi-chan!?&quot; she asked in a concerned voice.
        Usagi was beside herself.  She didn&#39;t know what to say.  Had
Minako seen what she was doing? She did the only thing she could, just
nod her head.  Minako smiled in relief, knealt down and hugged her.
        &quot;Good, I wouldn&#39;t want anything bad happen to you on your first
time.&quot; Minako said softly.
        Usagi was a bit confused. &quot;You mean..you know...you saw?&quot;
        Minako blushed a bit. &quot;Well, not all of it.  Just the climax, and
what a climax it was.  I felt the rest.&quot;
        Usagi didn&#39;t know if she should ashamed, or angry.  Mostly because
she had spied on Minako when she was enjoying a private moment.  That&#39;s
when something Minako said clicked in her head.
        &quot;What do you mean, &quot;felt&quot; it? she asked.
        Minako blushed a little more and explained. &quot;Usagi, you have to
remember. I&#39;m Sailor Venus.  Venus was the goddess of Love and Beauty.
And my name, Aino Minako means, Minako of Love.  I have the ability to
feel strong emotional vibrartions.  Especially when it something along
the romantic or intimate nature.&quot;
        Minako continued as she unfurled a large towel.  &quot;You see Usagi-
chan. Each one of us has a special ability.  Your&#39;s is the ability to
make friends, and  help people overcome thier troubles.  And over time
each of us will teach you how to use those abilities that we have.  Mako-
chan has her physical agility, and her deep sense of loyalty. She&#39;s also
an excellent cook.  You never know, you could win over Mamo-chan with
some spectacular cooking. Ami has her knowledge and intelect.  Rei is
spritual and wise in the mystic arts, and she knows alot about social
skills.  Then there&#39;s me.  My duty is to teach you the ways of love and
compassion.  With all of these, you will be able to follow in your
mother&#39;s footsteps
        &quot;That makes you my sex ed teacher then?&quot; Usagi said with a wry
smile.
        Minako blushed a bit.  &quot;I guess it does. But not just sex, Usagi.
Love, the ways of the heart and soul. Love is a complex thing, and it can
be difficult to understand. It&#39;s more than just a man and woman loving
each other.  It&#39;s about, Trust, Compassion, Loyalty, Faith and many other
wonderful things to learn about.  And it would seem you learned one of
your first lessons well.&quot;  Minako was trying to be reassuring.
        &quot;So you felt me doing this while you were swimming?&quot; Usagi asked.
        &quot;How did you know I was swimming?&quot; Minako was now curious, but she
had sly smile on her lips..
        &quot;Umm.. Umm.. You&#39;re shirt. It&#39;s all wet.&quot; Usagi made a play and
hoped it paid off.
        Minako smiled, &quot;I knew you were watching me, Usagi-chan.&quot;
        It was Usagi turn to blush. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.. I didn&#39;t mean to intrude
on you.  How did you notice I was there?&quot;
        Mianko chuckled as she wrapped the towel she was carrying around
Usagi&#39;s naked body. &quot;When you hid behind that bush, I saw these sticking
out the top.&quot; She tapped on Usagi&#39;s balls of blonde hair. &quot;I figured you
were just curious, and went about my swim.  Besides, I felt kind of
flattered being watched.&quot;
        &quot;Well, you do have beautiful figure.  Unlike me.&quot; Usagi almost
sounded pitiful.
        Minako was almost in shock. &quot;Hey now, don&#39;t get like that.  I just
blossomed early.  You&#39;re time is coming.  You&#39;ll be a full beautiful
women in no time.  You just have to wait for it.  Besides, the coming of
age thing is not what it&#39;s all cracked up to be.&quot;
        Usagi smiled a bit.  &quot;Do you like swimming nude, Minako-chan?&quot; she
asked nervously.
        &quot;Oh yes.  You wouldn&#39;t belive the feeling it can give you.  It&#39;s
something I encourage you to try.  And, I was kinda hoping you were going
to join me back there.&quot;  She giggled back.
        &quot;Join you?&quot; Usagi questioned.
        Minako nodded with a smile. &quot;Yes.  Skinny dipping is fun, but it
can be more fun with a good friend.&quot;
        Usagi blushed some more. &quot;I feel so... embarrased.&quot;
        Minako placed her hands on her shoulder. &quot;One thing you should
never be is embarrased, Usagi.  The most important kind of love is when
you love yourself.  If you truly don&#39;t love who you are, then you have
trouble loving those around you.  You took a big step today, and I&#39;m
proud of you.  As you become more comfortable with yourself, you&#39;ll
become more open and comfortable with those around you, and with those
you truly care about.&quot;  Minako&#39;s voice was gentle and caring.
        &quot;So, is this natural?&quot; Usagi asked nervously.
        &quot;Very.  I do it.&quot; Minako answered bluntly.
        Usagi&#39;s blush kept getting deeper.  &quot;Do you know if the
others.....&quot;
        &quot;Yes, but not all of them.  And I&#39;m not going to tell you which.
Just like them, I will keep this a secret.  They don&#39;t even know that I
know.&quot; Minako giggled.
        &quot;Do guys....you know... &quot; Usagi asked.
        &quot;Yep, them too.  But it&#39;s different for them.&quot; Minako answered.
        &quot;And sooner or later, boys and girls....you know....do it?&quot; Usagi
was as red as a tomato now.
        Minako held back the urge to laugh out loud.  &quot;Eventually, yes.&quot;
She giggled out.
        Usagi was curious. &quot;How so?&quot;  Usagi had a clue about what sex was,
but she was curious.
        &quot;Oh no, that&#39;s something you&#39;ll have to learn about at another
time.  When you&#39;re with the right man.&quot; Minako replied.
        &quot;The only man I want doesn&#39;t even know I&#39;m alive.&quot; Usagi sulked.
        &quot;You&#39;re a beautiful girl who is going to grow into a beautiful
woman. Don&#39;t ever forget that.  I know you are worried about Mamoru-san.
I know deep down inside, he loves you.  I can feel it in him when ever
he&#39;s near you.  I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s avoiding you, but he&#39;ll come around
when he sees what he&#39;s missing.  Then you&#39;ll have to beat him off with
your Cutie Moon Rod.&quot; Minako said back smiling.  Usagi didn&#39;t know what
to say, so she just hugged her friend.
        Minako held her best friend close for a minute or two. She then
pulled back and took a good look at her.  &quot;We need to get you cleaned up,
girl.  Can&#39;t take you back to the house looking like that.&quot;
        Usagi looked at herself.  She was all sweaty, and sand had stuck
to where ever she was damp from sweat, the tanning oil, and by other
means.  &quot;Yeah, this could be hard to explain.&quot;
        Minako snapped her fingers. &quot;I got an idea.  Grab your stuff
you&#39;re coming with me.&quot; Usagi nodded with a smile.  She had an idea what
Minako was up too, and the idea sounded fun to her.  After all, she was
sure now that they did think a like.
        Minako helped Usagi put on some thing to cover her.  Clad in only
T-shirts and sandals, the two girls carefully walked down the hill.
Usagi said she felt a bit off balance.  Minako explained that it was like
that for her the first time too, but it would pass.
        She lead Usagi back to the secluded pool.  Minako didn&#39;t hesitate
to remove her shirt.  She prompted Usagi to do the same.  Even though
Minako was privy to Usagi&#39;s intimacy, she was still a bit nervous.
        &quot;C&#39;mon girl.  You&#39;ve got nothing to hide.&quot; Minako encouraged her
on.  &quot;It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen you naked.&quot;
        Usagi smiled and nodded.  She lifted off her shirt and tossed in
the pile with the rest of their stuff.  Minako looked at Usagi, she
smiled as she examined Usagi&#39;s naked frame.  Minako began to appreciate
the innocent appearance of Usagi.  Usagi noticed this and blushed deeply,
and covered herself with her limbs.
        &quot;Wha.. What are you looking at?&quot; Usagi asked.
        Minako just chuckled and hugged Usagi. &quot;I just noticed, if it
wasn&#39;t for your hair style, you and I could pass ourselves off as twins.&quot;
        Usagi thought about this for a moment, she then reached behind her
and undid her hair, letting it fall down.  With it all the way down, it
was longer than Minako&#39;s.  She embraced her friend tightly, resting her
head on Minako&#39;s shoulder.  Minako held her back just a lovingly as she
she could, she felt something inside Usagi. It was cold and painful.
        &quot;Is it really all that bad between you and Mamo-chan, Usagi?&quot;
Minako asked.
        Usagi didn&#39;t say anything, only quietly nodded.
        &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it will work out.  Now, lets get you in the water,
and get you cleaned up.&quot; Minako said tenderly.  &quot;Besides, maybe a short
swim will help relax you.&quot;
        Minako took Usagi&#39;s hand and slowly led her into the pool.  Usagi
was suprised at how warm the water was.  Soon she was up to her neck.
There were small eddys and currents moving through the pool. She could
feel them on her, and she felt all the sand, and other substances be
cleansed off her as these mini currents enveloped and carressed her body.
 In answer to a question she asked herself earlier she noted, &quot;It does
feel different than being in a bathtub.&quot; She said.
        Minako blinked. &quot;Excuse me?&quot;
        Usagi giggled, &quot;Sorry, just making an observation.&quot;
        They both swam around the natural pool for several minutes.  Usagi
was obviously enjoying this new experiance.  Minako carefully watched
over Usagi as she swam, floated, and made several dives to the sandy
bottom of the 15 foot deep pool.  Soon, both of them sat on the sandy
bottom of the shallower end.
        &quot;Well, how do you like skinny dipping?&quot; Mianko asked.
        Usagi let out her usual silly laugh. &quot;You&#39;re right it is fun, and
even more fun with a friend.&quot;  Usagi stretched out her legs, and floated
on the top of the water.  Her breasts, stomach and thighs breached the
top.  Minako couldn&#39;t resist the oppurtunity, and tickled Usagi&#39;s
stomach.  Her reaction made her sink and go under water. Minako laughed a
bit, but her victory was cut short when Usagi surfaced and pushed Minako
under.
        When Minako resurfaced, she wrapped her arms around Usagi, pinning
Usagi&#39;s arms to the side.  &quot;Now what are you going to do?&quot;  She laughed
out.  Usagi was able to squirm a bit since both of them were wet and
slipperly, so she was able to get her arms around Minako&#39;s waist.  &quot;Who
has Who?&quot; Usagi declared.  Both of them smiled at each other as each of
them turned their grip, into an warm embrace.
        Usagi held onto Minako, she felt something in her stir.  A feeling
similar to what she felt on the hill.  She felt her breasts gently
touching and lightly rubbing Minako&#39;s as they squirmed against each
other.  Normally she would have felt mortified to be holding another girl
the way she was, let alone a naked one.   But she felt at ease at the
thought of Minako being so close to her.  She had always felt safe and
comforted when she was around Minako.  She wondered if was because she
was like a sister, or that she looked up to her as Sailor-V, her first
major idol.  Or was it something else?
        Minako herself was feeling a bit strange.  She cared very deeply
for Usagi.  She had watched over this girl even before she joined up with
the rest of the troop.  She had watched over Usagi before she was even
Sailor Moon.  While she cared deeply for all of them, She always had a
special place for Usagi in her heart.  Was is it sisterly, was it because
she was Princess Serenity? Or was because they were both sharing an
intimate moment together, which was a wonderful feeling to her.
        Both of them felt relaxed in each others arm.  Usagi&#39;s hand slowly
drifted up and down Minako&#39;s back.  Minako&#39;s body reacted as tiny
goosebumps popped up on her body.  She then felt something touch her
neck.  It was Usagi nuzzling her nose into the crook of her neck.  She
was getting warmer.  That&#39;s when she felt Usagi kiss her throat.  She was
quickly becoming aroused by Usagi&#39;s attention to her.  Her arousal kept
growing in her, and in Usagi.  She looked in Usagi&#39;s eyes.  She saw
something she never dreamed she would, Desire.
        &quot;Usagi, are you alright?&quot; She asked.
        Usagi&#39;s reply was soft and tender. &quot;I have somewhat of a
confession to make, Minako-chan.&quot;  Minako could see it in her sultry blue
eyes.  Her own desire was awakening, and was being urged since she could
also feel Usagi&#39;s.
        &quot;Since before I met you, Minako.  I have always admired Sailor V.
I worshiped her, you could say that I even desired her to a point.  And
since the day you came to us, I have admired, looked up to you, and later
on, I think, loved you.&quot;
        Minako was stunned by this surprising turn of events.  Here was a
girl, one of her best friends who less than an hour eariler had just
discovered her own sexuality, telling her point blank of her desire for
her.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say, Usagi.  I&#39;m guess I shouldn&#39;t be all
that surprised.  But what do you hope to accomplish by telling me this?&quot;
Minako was begining to worry where this encounter would take them.
        Usagi thought for a second. &quot;Minako, I know you can feel my desire
for you.  You said so yourself that you can feel romantic and intimate
vibrations, right?&quot;
        Minako couldn&#39;t deny it.  She felt it all right, It was screaming
in her head, her heart, and her hormones.  &quot;Usagi, before this goes any
farther.  I have to know.  Is this something that are completely sure you
want to do?  You could end up regretting this decision.&quot;
        Usagi smiled at her friend. &quot;I love each and everyone of you
girls, Minako. You are all more of a family to me than the one I have at
home.  But I especially love two people in this world, both of them
equally. One of them is Mamo-chan.  If we ever get back together, I have
dreamt of passionate nights with him, but I want to wait till we&#39;re
married.  And I have loved you for quite some time,  But I&#39;m just
realizing it now.&quot;
        &quot;I&#39;m not completely clueless as Rei would like to believe.  I know
the differance between the true love for a man, and the passionate love
of a friend.  But I have had.... thoughts about encounters with you,
dreams of holding you like I am now.  It was because I was thinking of
you, that I had my first experience.  I was alone, but you were in my
thoughts, and heart.  It felt like you were there with me.&quot;
        Minako was amazed at how much Usagi understood her own sexuality.
She swallowed dryly. &quot;So, you&#39;ve desired me for some time, eh?&quot;  Minako
had never been nervous about the topic of sex before.  This was a first
for her.
        Usagi nodded. She just smiled at Minako.  Minako didn&#39;t know what
to do...Yes she did.  But could she?  This was someone she swore to
protect, and now that person wanted to make love to her.  She didn&#39;t deny
it to herself.  She thought Usagi was pretty, and holding her now so
close did fill her mind with it&#39;s own naughty thoughts.  She watched
Usagi swim in the water, she saw how nice her body was and it did bring
up certain urges.  Love making with a female was nothing new to her.  Her
and Mako-chan had done it once, and she enjoyed it.  But that was only a
one time experiment.  She never thought it would happen again, and least
of all with Usagi!  &quot;V-chan, you said that as long as the love was true
it was good, and right.  You know my thoughts for you are pure, loving.
You have to feel that in you.&quot;
        Minako smiled and held her close. &quot;Ok, you&#39;re right. I do feel
your love for me, Usagi.  And it is does feel very strong.  Since this is
obviously something you want, and have wanted for quite sometime..    You
win.  I never could stop you once you set your mind to something.&quot;
Minako had to give in.  The sensual energies welling up in her were ready
to explode.  &quot;But.&quot; She added.  &quot;Since this your first time, I will only
go so far.  If you show any signs of doubt, or discomfort I will stop.&quot;
Usagi nodded.
        The only sound after that moment was the sound of the waterfall,
birds and the wind through the trees as the two of them knelt waist deep
in the water on the sandy bottom of the spring.  They looked into each
others eyes, it was clear where they were about to go, they drew thier
lips together and kissed for the first time. It felt magical to the both
of them.   Minako felt the full power of Usagi&#39;s passion in that first
kiss.  The energy of it was pure.  She knew this was right, and let
herself be taken away by the natural feelings in her heart and soul.
        The kiss lingered on their lips for as long as the air in their
lungs would let them.  Being very active champions of love and justice
gave them both a very strong pair of lungs and the kiss almost seemed to
last an eternity.   When they finally did break, reluctantly.  They each
had a full blush on their cheeks, but not from embarrassment.
        Usagi looked softly into Minako&#39;s blue eyes.  &quot;I wonder if we were
lovers back in the Silver Millennium?&quot; She said with a soft voice.  A
voice Minako only heard when Usagi was Princess Serenity
        Minako leaned over to kiss Usagi on the soft skin of her neck.
She placed small kisses along her neckline till she whispered with a
light giggle in Usagi&#39;s ear. &quot;I sure hope so.&quot;
        Usagi would have let out a small giggle herself if Minako hadn&#39;t
started nibbling on her earlobe.  She titled her head to the side to let
her venusian lover have her way.  Usagi felt so submissive, and she
wanted it that way.
        Minako saw how subduded Usagi was becoming under her attentions.
She placed several light kisses on Usagi&#39;s neck and shoulder.  Usagi was
off in another land, a land of pleasant and sensual dreams.  Minako
placed her hands on Usagi&#39;s hips and slowly moved them up and down the
sides of her body.  Her fingers carressed the the sides of her ribcage
and Usagi jumped a bit when she felt Minako&#39;s wrist brush up on the sides
of her breasts.   The feeling she had from touching herself was nothing
compared to the touch from another.
        Usagi herself felt like doing a bit of exploring.  She gingerly
reached out and cupped one of Minako&#39;s breasts in her dainty hand.
Minako shuddered with delight as Usagi began to massage her.
        &quot;Oh, Usagi-chan...&quot; Minako whimpered out.  Turn about was fair
play, so Minako in turn began to massage one of Usagi&#39;s breasts.  They
were smaller than Minako&#39;s, but no less firm.  The each relished this
feeling of touching one another.  Minako quickly realized that she was
the one becoming seduced here, and decided to take matters into her own
hands, as it were, and she moved around to Usagi&#39;s backside.
        Mianko wrapped her arms around Usagi&#39;s waist, and held her close.
Usagi leaned back and felt Minako&#39;s firm chest press agaisnt her back and
she seem to settle back against Minako.
        &quot;You ready, my pony-tailed princess?&quot; Minako whispered softly into
Usagi&#39;s ear. Usagi answered with a simple nod of her head.
        Minako began by rubbing cheek to cheek with Usagi.  Her soft
subtle hands movine across Usagi&#39;s firm mid-rif.  Even with all the
sweets this girl ate, she was able to keep a healthy figure.  Usagi began
to relax completely as Minako cradled and cuddled her in her arms.
        Minako gently raised her hands to gently hold Usagi&#39;s bosom in her
palms.  she fanned out her finger across the soft skin of Usagi&#39;s chest.
Usagi moaned slightly as Minako began to gently knead her breasts.  Her
nipples were already erect and hard from her earlier cuddling with
Minako.  She squirmed and giggled lightly as Minako tickled her nipple
with her finger tips.
        Minako nibbled along Usagi&#39;s neck-line.  Her lips dropping hot
kisses along her shoulders.  She slowly moved one hand away from Usagi&#39;s
breast while the other continued to tease and play with the one it held.
        Her hand moved slowly downward, rubbing her tummy as she went,
Usagi was almost limp as her body became putty in Minako&#39;s loving
embrace.  But that all ended when she felt Minako&#39;s hand embrace her
mound and rub her fingers on the sensitive area of her labia.  She arched
her body outward a bit which caused Minako&#39;s hand to press harder, and it
intensified the feeling.
        &quot;That feel good, sweetheart?&quot; Minako whispered in her ear.  Usagi
was only able to mutter a soft &quot;uh huh..&quot; as her body began to grind away
at Minako&#39;s hand.
        Minako noticed her skin and girlhood felt smooth as silk. As like
the rest of the girls Usagi kept her private areas smooth of any pubic
growth.  After all, imagine how embarrassing it would be for a senshi to
accidentally have her skirt fly and have tiny hairs sticking out the
sides of her fuku.      Minako&#39;s body was also becoming quite aroused
from the sensual massage she was giving Usagi. Minako&#39;s nipples had
become firm and it made her purr as they rubbed on Usagi&#39;s back.  Usagi
herself was completely taken away by what was happening to her.  She had
imagined that being carressed by a loved one would feel good.  But this
was beyond what she had expected as Minako slowly massaged her breast,
and fluttered her fingers over her virgin sex.
        &quot;Oh god, Minako. This is wonderful&quot; Usagi said with a blissful
sigh.
        Minako smiled and dabbed the tip of her tongue on Usagi&#39;s
shoulder.  She slowly drew it across her shoulder line and up the side of
her soft neck.  She kissed her ear and teased the earlobe with her
tongue.  This nearly drove Usagi over the edge.  Until, Minako stopped
and whispered in her ear.
        &quot;If you are ready, and willing.  I will take you to where you want
to go, my princess.&quot;  Minako&#39;s voice was soft, alluring, and gentle.
        Usagi let a happy tear fall from her eye. &quot;What must I do, V-
chan?&quot;
        Mianko patted Usagi&#39;s behind and motioned her to stand as Minako
started to stand as well.  She lead Usagi into deeper water.  She stopped
when the water was just to the middle of Usagi&#39;s and Minako&#39;s thighs.
She turned to Usagi, embraced her, and kissed her passionately.
        Usagi returned the kiss with all the love she could muster.  She
felt Minako&#39;s tongue slip past her lips.  She freely let it enter her
mouth, and met up to it with her own.  Both thier tongues danced inside
each others mouths.  Their tongues coiled and writhed together like the
lovers themselves did.  Their bodies rubbing and grinding agianst one
another in the light of the midday .
        They broke the passionate kiss long enough to get a breath of air,
and once again thier lips met for another steamy embrace.  As their
tongues made passionate love, their hands wandered and probed each of
their bodys.  Usagi&#39;s roamed and carressed Minako&#39;s back.  While Minako&#39;s
moved downward to Usagi&#39;s pert bottom and began to massage her cheeks.
        Usagi&#39;s hips arched forward and she moaned as Minako fondled her
behind.  She moaned deeply as her&#39;s and Minako&#39;s sexes rubbed.  Minako
herself let out a soft moan she felt Usagi push against her pelvic
region.  They each broke off gasping for air.
        Minako smiled as she saw how aroused her lover was.  She looked at
Usagi&#39;s breasts and saw that her nipples were extremely swollen and
looked like little cherries ready to be plucked.  She couldn&#39;t stop
herself if she wanted to, but she drew her lips down on one of Usagi&#39;s
nipples and gently began to suckle the girl.
        Usagi cried out in pleasure as Minako took her into her lips.  She
felt the warm moist feeling of Minako&#39;s mouth on her nipple.  It almost
made her pass out, but Minako&#39;s hand braced her from her behind.
        Minako twriled her tongue around the delicate nub.  She nibbled it
with her lips and ran her teeth across it.  Each movement she made on it
casued Usagi to make a different sound. Minako was having too much fun
teasing Usagi&#39;s breasts.
        Minako&#39;s mouth drew the tender nub deep in between her lips, and
let her tongue flick across the tip.  Usagi gasped as this happened.
Minako began tugging on the nipple by sucking on it and drawing her mouth
away from it.  It softly popped from her lips.  She giggled, and repeated
this actions several times much to Usagi&#39;s enjoyment.
        Usagi&#39;s other breasts was also getting attention of a different
kind.  Minako had used her free hand to hold the firm breast in her hand.
While her mouth ravaged Usagi&#39;s other breast, her hand was gentle and
loving.  She softly stroked and massaged Usagi.  The different feelings
made Usagi whimper slightly.  She placed her hands on Minako&#39;s head as
she licked and petted her.  Her fingers combed gently through Minako&#39;s
golden tresses.  She then felt Minako move, downward.
        Mianko couldn&#39;t help herself.  She didn&#39;t want it to go this far
so fast, but the sensual energies she had felt from Usagi were driving
her on.  She was becoming hungrier and hungrier for more of Usagi as she
went on.  Her lips and tongue teased the underside of Usagi&#39;s breasts.
She kissed and nibbled her way down the firm tummy of Usagi&#39;s waist.
Usagi was so turned on by this she began breathing deeper and deeper.
        Minako stopped at Usagi&#39;s navel.  She remembered Usagi&#39;s recation
to when she tickled her earlier.  Her one act that may have set off this
chain of events.   She got an evil grin and began to tickle Usagi&#39;s belly
button with her tongue.  Usagi nearly lost it as the ticklish feeling
welled up and exploded.
        &quot;V-chan! That tickles!&quot; She yelled out laughing.  Minako stopped
to giggle herself.  Then she saw it, Usagi&#39;s most intimate spot.  Smooth,
pink.  The soft petal like lips of her labia swollen slightly from
Usagi&#39;s incredibly aroused state.  The water from the pool, and from
Usagi&#39;s own arosal almost made it glisten in the sunlight.  She hesitated
for a moment.  Could she do this?  This was her friends most private
place.  Could she invade her like this?
        Usgai placed a finger under Minako&#39;s chin and tilted her head up
to look her in the eyes.  No words were said.  No sound from either of
them.  Usagi simply smiled, and nodded.  Minako smiled back up at her and
nodded herself.
        Usagi closed her eyes and waited. She then felt something
wonderful.  Minako kissed the spot just above her girlhood.  The
electricity of that intimate kiss ran up and down her body.  Minako
placed several light kisses around Usagi&#39;s sex, but never once actually
touching it.  Usagi was cooing and whimpering with each little peck
Minako made on her.
        Minako inhaled Usagi&#39;s girlish scent through her nose.  She
noticed that it was different than when she was with Mako-chan.
Makoto&#39;s was more musky, stronger.  Usagi&#39;s was more like a lite sweet
perfume, just barely there to be noticed.  Despite it&#39;s light scent, it
was all the encouragemaent Minako need to go on.
        Gently, and lightly she placed her tongue at the base of Usagi&#39;s
labia and with a slow and loving stroke drew it up the length of her
lips.  Usagi squealed in pleasure, her cry could have been heard from a
distance.  Lukily it wasn&#39;t, but neither of them would havae cared.
Minako started kissing and lapping at Usagi.
        As Minako kissed and licked at Usagi, her actions slowly opened
the petal soft lips of Usagi&#39;s labia and exposed her inner regions.
Minako was captivated by the sight of the little pearl sized nub of
Usagi&#39;s clitoris as it came from it&#39;s hiding spot.  She dabbed her tongue
on it to see what Usagi&#39;s reaction would be.
        Usagi suddenly felt something rush through her body.  She had been
very relaxed from Minako&#39;s attention.  A warm loving feeling had been
flowing through her body and soul, but that was all shoved aside as
Minako began to flick her tongue across Usagi&#39;s love button.  As she did
this, a feeling swept through her like a tsunami that was building and
building, she was becoming very weak and her balance was faultering.  It
was clear that Minako noticed this because before Usgai knew it, her
right leg was hoisted up and over Minako&#39;s shoulder, which gave Usagi the
support she needed.
        This exposed more of Usagi to Minako, who took full advantage of
it.  She reached her arms around Usagi&#39;s backside and held her firmly as
she began to flail her tongue inside with full force.  Usagi was rocked
by this assault and she arched her back causing Her ivory bosom to jut
outward and make them jiggle slightly and light gasping sound came from
her open mouth.
        Minako knew it wouldn&#39;t be long.  She could hear Usagi&#39;s moaning
growing louder and louder as she probed and licked every inch of Usagi&#39;s
girlhood.  Minako made the final move as she brought her hand to Usagi&#39;s
front and with the tip of her finger she circled the outer rim of Usagi&#39;s
vagina.  Not entering her, but softly tracing the edges.
        Usagi couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Every muscle in her body tightened
and she went rigid as she felt that wave pass through her.  But unlike
the feeling on the hill, this was more powerful, hotter, deeper in
feeling than when she was by herself.  She cried out, &quot;V-chan!&quot;  Her head
and shoulders arched fully back as the full impact of the orgasm hit her
as the tsunami that was building in her crashed though her body.
        Back at the beach house, all was serene and the only real noise
came from Rei&#39;s CD Boom box.  Clad in only her green and black two piece
suit, and an apron Mako-chan was in the kitchen preparing lunch for
everyone.  The other&#39;s had always been very appreciative of her efforts,
and sometimes felt guilty.  She didn&#39;t mind, in fact she really enjoyed
doing it for them whenever she got the chance.  As for the other girls,
Rei and Chibi-Usa were playing a card game on the deck, and Ami sat at
the desk in the living room studying.  Luna and Artemis had found that
the hammock under the shade tree was a great place for a snooze.
        All of them had changed into their swimsuits.  Rei&#39;s beach house
had all the comforts of home, save one.  No air conditioning. Then
suddenly Rei, Makoto and Ami all felt something.   Ami dropped her
pencil, Rei shivered as though a chill went up her spine, and light
giggle was heard from the kitchen.
        Mako-chan stuck her head out the litchen doorway. &quot;Did you guys
just get the weirdest feeling?&quot;
        Rei looked back into the house. &quot;Yeah, weird is one way to
describe it.  I seem to remember feeling something simliar once, but I
can&#39;t place it.&quot;
        Chibi-Usa blinked, &quot;I didn&#39;t feel anything.&quot;
        Ami turned to both of them, &quot;Wasn&#39;t it back during that blizzard
last winter?  Usagi, and I were trapped at Rei-chan&#39;s Temple.  And You
were stuck over at Minako&#39;s house.  The three of us woke up feeling the
same wierd sensation.&quot;
        Makato thought for a second.... She got a bit wide eyed for
second, for quickly got her composure back and promptly went back into
the kitchen.  &quot;I&#39;m sure it was nothing.  BTW, lunch is almost ready.  I
wonder if Usagi-chan, and Mina-chan will be back soon?&quot;
        Chibi-Usa smirked. &quot;She&#39;s probably fallen asleep and getting
cooked raw. Then she&#39;ll look like a big red lobster, He He.&quot;
        Rei thought for a moment, &quot;Actually, we&#39;re all pretty hungry.  I
bet it was hunger pangs...I guess.&quot;
        &quot;It&#39;s not like Usagi to be late for a meal, Rei-chan.&quot; Ami
commented. &quot;I mean, even Minako would never miss one of Mako-chan
feasts.&quot;
        Rei nodded. &quot;It is kind of odd.&quot;
        Mako-chan&#39;s voice came from the kitchen.  &quot;If they haven&#39;t
returned by after lunch.  We&#39;ll go look for them.&quot;
        Rei and Ami nodded and Ami made a notation, &quot;Have you guys ever
noticed that those two seem to think too much a like at times?&quot;
        &quot;Yeah, scary isn&#39;t it?&quot; Makoto laughed from the kitchen.
        Back at the pool Usagi was being held in Minako&#39;s arms and Usagi
was holding her back.  They had settled back to where they were before,
but the sun had drifted across the sky and the shallows were in the shade
now.  Minako softly kissed Usagi on her temple and lightly stroked her
back.  Neither of them had said anything since Usagi&#39;s climax.  Minako
looked down at Usagi who was nestled against her bosom, eyes closed, and
warm smile on her face as she was gently suckling one if Minako&#39;s
breasts.
        &quot;How are you doing, Usagi-chan?&quot; Minako&#39;s voices was gentle and
soothing.
        Usagi tilted her head up and lightly kissed Minako. &quot;I feel
wonderful, V-chan.  Thank you.&quot; Minako said nothing, but held her closer.
        &quot;Minako-chan?&quot;
        &quot;Yes Usagi-chan?&quot;
        &quot;WIll it feel just as good with a man?&quot;
        Minako coughed a bit, but regained her composure, &quot;Umm, I really
can&#39;t say Usagi-chan... I&#39;m still a virgin like you.  But I have a
feeling that if you&#39;re thinking of the man I think you are, it will be
even more magical.  Just be patient, and bide your time.  I have a funny
feeling things will work out for the best, if you don&#39;t rush it.&quot;
        Usagi thought for a moment, &quot;Basically, let it happen on it&#39;s own.
When the time is right?
        Minako smiled, &quot;You&#39;re learning.&quot;
        Usagi suddenly got sly look in her eyes and without warning,
tickled Minako vigorousy.  Minako burst out in an almost tearful laugh
until she was able to squirm away from Usgai.
        &quot;What was that for?!?&quot; Minako said in slight shock.
        Usagi gave her a smug look, &quot;That was for earlier when you tickled
me.  I don&#39;t get mad, I get even.&quot;
        Minako grinned, &quot;Oh yeah, we&#39;ll see about that!&quot;  And then Minako
lunged after Usagi who was alredy trying to make her escape.
        Makoto, Ami, Rei, and Chibi-Usa were all searching the forest as a
group.  Luna and Artemis were off searching in another section of the
rain forest.  Minako and Usagi didn&#39;t come back to the house for lunch.
This was concerning all of them.
        Makoto was up a tree looking around. &quot;Where do you think they
went?&quot; But jumped down when she couldn&#39;t see anything.
        &quot;I don&#39;t know, this island isn&#39;t that big.&quot; Ami noted as they
walked down the path.
        Rei was being her sarcastic self.  &quot;And Usagi would never miss a
meal.&quot;
        &quot;I have an idea.&quot; Chibi-Usa said.  She looked at Luna-P. &quot;Luna-P,
go up in the air and find Minako-chan and Usagi-chan.&quot;  The floating
black cat head headed skyward.  The group watched as it stopped above the
tree level, paused, and came back down.  When it reached the group, it
started moving away from the path. &quot;See, I knew it would work.&quot;
        They all followed the Luna-P until they reached the clearing with
the pool and waterfall.  In the pool they saw Minako and Usagi giggling
and splashing each other. It was hard to tell which was which, since
Usagi still had her hair down, and Minako was missing her trademark bow.
They were in waist deep water, and both of them were as naked as the day
they were born, and they had a warm glow about them.  The two of them
looking like mischievious water nymphs.
        &quot;What in heavens name are you two doing!?&quot; Rei almost exploded.
        Usagi and Minako finally took notice of their friends.  They
looked at themselves, looked at the other girls, and then looked at each
other again, then laughed.
        &quot;What&#39;s it look like, Rei.  We&#39;re skinny dipping.&quot; Usagi said
mockingly.  The two blondes embraced trying to look as innocent as
possble.  It was almost impossible to tell them apart.
        Makoto was surpressing laughter, &quot;Aren&#39;t you two a pair?&quot;
        Ami was just blushing.
        Rei looked less than amused, &quot;Yeah, but a pair of what?&quot;
        Chibi-Usa was just confused.
        &quot;Oh please, Rei.  We&#39;re the only people here on this island, we&#39;re
all girls.  What&#39;s the harm?&quot; Everyone was silent.  &quot;Oh come on, you
girls have gone the hot springs and done this, and I know we&#39;ve all been
to public baths, and those are filled with strangers.  What so different
than that? Minako added. &quot;Why don&#39;t you all join us?  You won&#39;t regret
it.&quot;
        The other girls didn&#39;t know what to say.  That was until Makoto
stripped off her green two peice and dove into the water. &quot;Alright Mako-
chan!&quot; Usagi cheered. Mako-chan surfaced next to Minako and whispered
something into her ear.  Minako had a puzled look on her face.  Makoto
whispered again.  Minako then blushed deeply and giggled.
        Rei and Ami were in shock, and they both went into more shock when
Chibi-Usa joined them. She was till in her swim suit, but she joined them
nether the less and waded out to where Mako-chan came to meet her and
carried her to the deeper water.  Rei was just about to say something to
Ami when she saw her stripping off her blue and white tank suit.  Her jaw
dopped.
        &quot;Not you too, Ami?!&quot; She exclaimed.
        Ami just shrugged, &quot;You know what they say.  When in Rome...&quot; with
that, she dove in and joined the others in their aquatic frolics.
        Rei was beside herself.. she had to be.  There was no one else
left to stand next too.  She sighed heavily, swallowed her pride and
pulled down her suit. She waded in, and in a few minutes of swimming,
diving and horse playing around, they all completely forgot about any
thoughts of modesty and had a wonderful time.
        Meanwhile, Artemis and Luna were still searching.  That was until
Luna heard something. &quot;I hear something.... Wait here, I&#39;ll go check it
out.&quot;  She darted through some bushes. Artemis also heard the sounds of
splashing, and laughing.  He started to follow her, but when he began
entering the bushes Luna flew out tackling him.  He noticed that her face
was very red as she flew headlong into him.
        &quot;Luna?!? What is it?!  What did you see?  And will you get off of
me!&quot; Artemis was pinned face down in the ground.
        &quot;Not until you make me a promise.&quot; she said as she kept him down.
        &quot;What? What did you see!?&quot; He asked impatiently.
        &quot;You have to promise me you won&#39;t go in there.&quot; She said sternly.
        &quot;Ok, I won&#39;t. I promise.  NOW WILL YOU GET OFF ME!&quot;  He yelled.
        Luna stepped off Artemis&#39; back, letting him up. &quot;Remember, you
promised.&quot;
        Artemis got up. &quot;Ok, what did you see in there?&quot; He asked as he
used his tail to brush away dirt.
        &quot;The girls.&quot; Luna answered.
        &quot;Which ones?&quot; He asked.
        &quot;All of them.&quot; She said calmly.
        &quot;Then what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Artemis cocked an ear to one side.
        &quot;They&#39;re swimming.&quot; She replied.
        Artemis got a puzzled look. &quot;Yeah, so we saw them swimming
yester..&quot; Luna cut him off. &quot;Naked?&quot;
        Artemis&#39; jaw dropped and his tail shot straight out.
        &quot;Remember, you promised.&quot; Luna reminded him.
        Artemis sat there frozen....He didn&#39;t know what to do.  He saw
Luna staring him down.  &quot;You know I can out run you Luna?&quot; He said with a
cocky tone.
        She turned her head away from him. &quot;Yes, but I can always out
think you, then I would lose all respect for you, and never speak to you
again.  And the girls might think the same way.&quot;  She hit a nerve.
        Artemis turned to her.  &quot;You&#39;re right.  It&#39;s not worth it.
Besides, there are more beautiful things to look at in this tropical
paradise.&quot;  He stepped up and nuzzled Luna on the neck.
        Luna blushed, &quot;Now cut that out you scoundrel.&quot;
        He then whispered in her ear. &quot;And there&#39;s better things to chase
after than nubile young girls.&quot;  He looked at Luna with a sly look and
wiggling his whiskers at her.
        &quot;Ar..Artemis...Don&#39;t you even think it...&quot; Luna knew that look
well.  And she also knew that when Artemis got that look, the chase was
about to begin.  She acted like she didn&#39;t like it, but then it was just
an act.  She had always been able to out run him back in Tokyo, so She
took her paw, swung it to lightly bop him on the nose.  &quot;TAG! You&#39;re it!&quot;
and then Luna scampered off.
        Artemis got a silly grin.  &quot;Not this time pussycat.&quot; He then
started his countdown, &quot;Juu, Kyu, Hachi..&quot; and as he did, he coiled
himself as though he were launching off an aircraft carrier. &quot;San, Ni,
Ichi, REI! Ikimasu!&quot;  He then shot off like a white blur into the forest
after his intended quarry.
        Back in the pool, the girls were all relaxing in the water. Rei,
Makoto, and Ami sat in the shallows, talking and laughing amongst
themselves.  Chibi-Usa sat in Rei&#39;s lap.  No longer were the inhabitions
of modesty keeping them from enjoying themselves.   Minako and Usagi were
sitting on some the large smooth boulders by the misty water fall.  They
were taking in some of the sun as the mist kept them cool.
        Usagi whispered in Mianko&#39;s ear. &quot;What did Mako-chan say to you
earlier?&quot;
        Minako giggled, &quot;She said she wish she&#39;d known we were gonna do
this.  She would have loved to have joined us.&quot;
        Usagi blinked,  &quot;But if she did..then you and I would never
had....&quot;
        &quot;No Usagi, that&#39;s the part she wanted to join in on.&quot; Minako
smiled back.
        Usagi&#39;s ears reddened, which eventually spread to her cheeks.  Her
eyes went wide and all she could say was. &quot;Oooohhhhh My.&quot;  They both
giggled and then they were both silently looking at their friends, until
Minako sat straight up.
        &quot;What is it Minako-chan?&quot; Usagi asked.
        &quot;I don&#39;t know... I felt something..  But we&#39;re all here.&quot; she said
quietly.
        &quot;You mean like when I, and we?&quot; Usagi kept her voice down.
        Minako nodded quietly.
        &quot;But if all of us are here, then who?&quot; Usagi inquired.
        &quot;We&#39;re not all here, Usagi-chan.&quot; She whispered back.
        Usagi thought for a moment. &quot;No...you don&#39;t think?&quot;
        Minako felt another vibration. She just got a silly smile on her
face, &quot;Way to go, Artemis and Luna.&quot; she said quietly, and laid back down
on the boulder.
        Usagi just sat there, &quot;Minako, I don&#39;t understand.&quot;
        Minako chuckled with eyes closed. &quot;Usagi-chan, you&#39;ll learn.  Just
remember one thing.&quot;
        &quot;What&#39;s that, Minako-chan?&quot;
        &quot;There&#39;s a first time for everything.&quot;</pre>
