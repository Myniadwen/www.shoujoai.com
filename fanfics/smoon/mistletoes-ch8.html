(Usagi)
&quot;Oh, it is so pretty, Mina-chan, arigato gozaimasu!&quot; I flung myself 
at my friend before she could even prepare for the impact and gave 
her a bear huge and at an afterthought a quick kiss... on the cheek 
of course. Girlfriend present after all. Wouldn&#39;t be good otherwise. 
Even then I have the impression that Hotaru-chan wouldn&#39;t mind. 
Especially seeing as said woman was giggling insanely at Minako&#39;s 
stupefied expression.
	I had gotten used to it by now. Ever since we arrived here 
late afternoon, she had been like that. Minako had warned me of this 
but I hadn&#39;t quite believed her. She was so... carefree. It was 
scary. But a pleasant kind of scary and it became refreshing after 
awhile. This new mood was so much like the Hotaru of the old days and 
strangely that made me feel more at ease instead of nostalgic.
	I sat the little statue on the table and stared at it for 
awhile. I was getting a little bit nostalgic now but that was okay. 
Mako-chan would have loved it. The features were really detailed and 
you could see that the artist worked on it with a passion. Completely 
made of ice with a thin layer of... something - to prevent it from 
melting I suppose - the figures of Miisha and Janerin, the former 
gold medal winners at ice skating were beautifully carved and 
sparkled in the candlelight of the room.
	&quot;I really don&#39;t know what to say. That must have been 
expensive.&quot; And we had agreed not to go to great lengths for gifts. 
Heh, as if that ever works. Granted, we were not rich but money 
wasn&#39;t really an issue at the moment. Hotaru might be the only one 
who could be described as the former. Not that she was bragging with 
it of course.
	I hadn&#39;t been very reserved with my gifts either. Hotaru&#39;s 
delight had warmed my heart. After our encounter a few days ago, I 
had gotten that picture copied in pocket format and put into a pink 
heart locket with a silver chain. It was now hanging around the raven-
haired girl&#39;s neck. Minako&#39;s gift was a little harder to obtain. 
First I did not quite know what to get her but Hotaru had helped 
there and provided me with the necessary idea. The next problem was 
that the price even for our financial situation hadn&#39;t been easy. 
Hotaru had lent me a little bit since she didn&#39;t have anything 
commercial for Minako. They had obviously agreed that the best 
present for them this year was their love. How sweet.
	Anyway, we had finally obtained the item in question and now 
Minako was the proud owner of a very rare and unique panpipe. Hotaru 
had mentioned that before the incident, when the other blonde still 
had her career plans set on being a teenie star, she had taken some 
instrumental courses and sometimes practiced on a similar flute when 
she had been over at the Outers&#39; estate...s. None of us ever heard 
her play except Hotaru and I could tell it must have been lovely. She 
hadn&#39;t touched it until now though. Treated it with almost royal 
respect.
	&quot;Well, let&#39;s hope it doesn&#39;t turn into a Youma or is a part 
of a million years old comet,&quot; Hotaru commented which brought a laugh 
from all of us at the memory. Hotaru hadn&#39;t been present when the 
Snow Queen was invading Earth but we had told her everything later 
on. She stood up now and tugged on Minako&#39;s hand. &quot;Well, minna. Time 
for my gift. It&#39;s actually for you, Usagi-chan, but it might as well 
count for everyone here.&quot;
	Minako had stood up by now and had rushed upstairs for a 
moment. I admit I was already curious when Hotaru proceeded to lead 
me through the hallways. We stopped in front of another door and I 
could feel my senses tingling. Something... incredible pure was in 
that room. Something old... ancient. A moment later Minako came back 
with three traditional one-colored robes in hand. One in orange, one 
in purple and one in blue. It didn&#39;t take a genius which one was for 
whom. After wordlessly donning the clear silk material, Hotaru opened 
the door and we entered the room.
	I stood in the doorway for some minutes probably taking in 
the sight. The pentagram-organized candles were bathing the room in 
their light. The smell of the herbs was adding to the mysterious 
atmosphere the twilight glow was creating. I could feel the power 
from the circle. Still dormant but waiting, pulsing in expectation of 
being released soon. And I had the feeling it would really be soon.
	&quot;That&#39;s... That&#39;s beautiful,&quot; I breathed. &quot;Demo... what is it 
for?&quot; Hotaru smiled gently and took one of my hands in hers, the 
other already joined with Minako&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; Carefully Hotaru 
led us through the room. I was extra cautious not to step on or brush 
against any of the candles and herbs. The center of the pentagram was 
bare of any herbs and we had just enough room to stand side by side.
	Hotaru knelt down and we followed her lead. Minako obviously 
knew what was going on but I knew none of them would tell me. It was 
supposed to be a surprise after all and I trusted my friends. 
Unconditionally.
	&quot;Touch this and transfer a portion of your power on it. 
Everyone a third.&quot; Hotaru had produced a gold coin that looked 
extremely old out of nowhere. I was a little confused at the request 
but did as I was told. Soon the coin was shimmering in a light layer 
of orange-gold, purple and silver. The other girl was folding her 
hands, coin between them, as if praying... Correction, scratch 
the &quot;as if&quot;. She WAS praying.
	&quot;Repeat after me.
	Departed souls, departed friends,
	heroes fallen and sisters lost.
	We step before you as one, to see those we seek!&quot;
	Again something was tugging on my senses and soon - even 
though I still had no idea what was going on - I felt Serenity take 
over and after the first few lines we were praying truly as one. 
Hotaru held the coin in front of her. She was kneeling right in the 
center and the candle before her was probably the closest to it. 
Slowly the dark-haired girl let go of the coin and it fell... only to 
stop and hover over the flickering flame of the candle.
	&quot;Ferryman Charon, thee we ask, grant us passage!
	Take this coin as an offer and let us cross the river Styx,
	to where the passed shall go and no living ever journey.&quot;
	The pentagram was flowing with energy now and I could hear 
the distant sound of a river. A bell was softly chiming.
	&quot;Forgive us the ingression of your realm, oh great Pluto and 
Persephone.
	Calm the beast known as Cerebus and let us safely past,
	our motives only sincere they are, can&#39;t you see?&quot;
	My vision was beginning to blur as I felt my spirit detaching 
from its physical chains. Were the candles actually glowing in a line 
of pure white light now?
	&quot;We beseech thee, Minos, Aeacus and Rhadamanthus,
	hear our honest plea!
	They have been wronged and so have we,
	our souls bleed from the greatness of the crime.
	Bring them forth so that we may find peace!&quot;
	My vision was beginning to overflow with a blinding white 
light and I began to feel incredible light-weighted. However, there 
still was some resistance. Something holding me... us back from... 
whatever we were doing.
	&quot;By the five elements of life we solicit!
	Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Spirit!
	By the five elements of death we demand!
	Hate, Oblivion, Misery, Sorrow, Fires of Punishment!
	Bring forth the ones being wronged! Bring forth our sisters!&quot;
	The energy level sprang up again and through my near-blinded 
vision I could see the flames of the candles shooting up a few inches.
	&quot;Oh Lady of All and Lord of Nothing,
	glowing softly in silver, shining brightly in gold;
	by this cycle we beseech thy fragments!
	Part the veils and open the gate to Elysium Fields,
	to the place where heroes go!&quot;
	Almost there. I could almost touch the spiritual plane. I 
doubt I was still connected to my physical body, yet not quite there, 
where I... we wanted to go. The words should give me some ideas but I 
didn&#39;t really hear them. They were spoken instinctual and I was 
wrapped up in the incredible experience. I suppose I was in a trance 
or something. The volume of our chant had increased and was now a 
near crescendo as we neared the final verse.
	&quot;That is all we ask, that is all we wish,
	one last time let our hearts be as one!&quot;
	On instinct I reached out with both hands they touched with 
Hotaru and Minako&#39;s. The energy was flaring. &quot;NOW!&quot; Hotaru shouted 
and with another flash of blinding white we were yanked away tumbling 
into... darkness. A thickly deep void of absolutely... nothing. The 
best I could come up with was a large sea that stretched out into 
infinity. The experience was only for a brief moment and still seemed 
to last for all eternity.
	Finally I could feel and see again. The first thing I felt 
were the supporting hands of my friends and then there was a light in 
the far distance, approaching quickly. A dull crimson light that was 
pulsating brightly once in a while. I actually felt a slippery 
substance around my body. Water? Yes, a stream of some sort. It felt 
familiar.
	*We are on Lethe, the Waters of Forgetting,* I heard Hotaru&#39;s 
voice in my head. Lethe? But then why...? *I suppose it&#39;s her way to 
make amends. Hotaru had some doubts we wouldn&#39;t lose something on the 
way.* That was Minako. The explanation made senses somewhat. Our last 
encounter had not been pleasant and it was only due to her sister 
that we survived the encounter with our memories still intact. I 
still didn&#39;t understand what we were doing here. Although I had a 
pretty good idea now where exactly we were.
	&quot;WHO DARES PASS THE REALMS OF THE DEAD AND ENTER THE ISLE OF 
HEROES!&quot; Ack, that was loud. I could... feel... Hotaru about to 
answer the booming voice of the unseen speaker but that became 
unnecessary a second later. &quot;Let them pass.&quot; There was something 
about that voice that I could pick up out of a crowd EVERYWHERE. To 
often she had used it to surprise us from out of nowhere. My heart 
was pounding. That couldn&#39;t be but yet the voice was unmistakable.
	&quot;BUT MILADY, WHAT ABOUT...?&quot; The booming voice interrupted my 
thoughts. Then she spoke again and that time I could SWEAR that it 
was her. &quot;Please, lower your voice level. What should our guests 
think? Let them pass.&quot; The tone was still quiet but had the distinct 
sharpness of an order. The next thing I knew I was somewhere else.
	The sudden appearance of colors, shapes and well... 
everything was too much for my senses to comprehend. I pressed my 
eyes tightly shut at the sensation. &quot;Gomen about this. Better that 
way?&quot; My eyes snapped open again against all warnings. The colors 
were much darker now, shady. The shapes of hills and long fields of 
grass and flowers looked as if overshadowed by a layer of black and 
gray and they were not quite... tangible. Altering size and even 
shape in a matter of seconds.
	But before I could get dizzy by it, my focus had already 
shifted at the figure in front of me. The long, dark hair, the deep 
violet eyes, with a sparkle of mischief still there, everything was 
as I remembered. Even the long red robe suited her just fine. The red 
sigil of Mars was shining like a ruby on her forehead. &quot;Rei,&quot; I 
croaked out, my voice hoarse and the ability to speak suppressed by 
the emotions smashing down on my heart.
	&quot;Who did you expect, Odango Atama? Santa Claus?&quot; That impish 
smile, that tiny, almost aristocratic huff, the sparkle of mischief 
in her eyes at our usual banter... I wanted to lurch forward, wrap 
her in my arms, I in her arms... That wasn&#39;t important. I wanted to 
hug her and never let go, never EVER again. I wanted to, do you hear 
me? I WANTED TO! Didn&#39;t work though. Pah, movies and novels are still 
fiction after all.
	&quot;Gomen. Still bound to the rules here even though we... err, 
Pluto let you trespass.&quot; I could still move, had my hand 
outstretched, mere inches from touching her. Yet I could not. &quot;You 
are...&quot; I shook with a sudden fit of giggles but managed to tone it 
down to somehow sound seriously hurt. &quot;You are... SO MEAN!&quot; And then 
I let go and exploded in laughter. We both were actually. It was 
extraordinarily relieving, the laughter was washing away all that 
pain and the... the... tight, tight ball of dark emotions sitting 
just underneath the surface. I felt light and happy and... good. Just 
good. Just so... good.
	&quot;Kami, Usagi-chan...&quot; Rei managed after a while of intriguing 
laughter. Another chuckle followed unbidden. &quot;That was the best laugh 
I had in... what was it for you? Six years, I think. Time is rather 
irrelevant here, you know?&quot; I felt my mood dimming again at the 
reminder of where we were. Where SHE... THEY were. &quot;Rei-chan...&quot; I 
felt my tongue tightening again and that dark feelings... Control, 
Usagi! That was hard though. Just being a spirit... soul?... and 
everything. Rei bend forward a little and held up her finger, almost 
touching my nose. A little smile was on her face. It was neither 
strained nor sad. Just a smile. &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; she said.
	Of course I didn&#39;t listen. &quot;Demo... I failed you...&quot; Rei 
shook her head and I could actually feel a tingly feeling as 
Rei &quot;poked&quot; me on the nose with her finger. Of course she didn&#39;t 
really touch me but she would have if she could. &quot;Iie, Usagi-chan. WE 
failed YOU. WE should have protected YOU. And we did but yet we 
failed. Because we couldn&#39;t protect the most important thing. Your 
happiness and your innocence. Do you blame us for that?&quot; I shook my 
head vehemently at the ridiculousness of the question. &quot;Of course you 
don&#39;t and we don&#39;t blame you... Of course we wouldn&#39;t have a reason 
to do so.&quot; I opened my mouth to protest again, I really wanted to. 
But then, the only thing that came out was said in a very small 
voice, reluctantly excepting her reasoning. &quot;Okay...&quot;
	And I felt good again. Even more now. I felt... FORGIVEN! It 
did not matter if I felt like I failed them or not. They did not 
care. They still loved me. And without really saying so had forgiven 
me. &quot;Arigato,&quot; I whispered unable to say more. Rei stepped back and 
relaxed her posture. &quot;Well then, I&#39;m going to join the others and see 
how they are doing. Time to leave you two alone after all.
	I looked at her confused, a part of me crying out for her 
that she couldn&#39;t go, not so soon. But another, bigger part just felt 
content that everything had been said and done already. &quot;What do 
you...?&quot; Rei smiled serenely... Hey, that&#39;s my line! &quot;You see. 
Sayonara... Odango Atama.&quot; And with that she was gone. I stared at 
the place where the miko had been standing for a few more seconds 
before finally whispering my own goodbye. &quot;Until we meet again.&quot;
	The... place was silent for a long time. I could hear 
whispered sounds all around me and all of them felt good. Strong and 
good. Then another familiar voice. First only a feeling, a sensation 
I hadn&#39;t felt for years, seemed more like a lifetime. Then that 
strong, masculine voice that always provided me with new hope and 
strength. &quot;Usako.&quot;
	I felt tears welling up once again as I turned slowly towards 
the voice. There! THERE! Wrapped into a glistering aura of gold, clad 
in full armor, sword fastened on the belt. There HE was! My world. My 
center. My confidence. My strength. My love. My... &quot;Mamo-chan...&quot;

(Minako)
The real word came rushing back a bit too quickly as I realized to my 
dismay. My body shook with spasms for a moment when my spirit was 
yanked back to the mortal realm. A low groan was not to be prevented 
and I could hear Hotaru besides me suppress a slight gasp. The 
surroundings were only slowly coming back into focus and I felt more 
drained than after a good, long fight with several Youma. I didn&#39;t 
count but I guess I needed several minutes to adjust to the real 
world again.
	Finally managing to do more than blinking and trying to clear 
the cobwebs in my awareness, I was about to stretch. I turned around 
slowly and froze for a short moment. Usagi was only a blur as she 
suddenly moved from her position on the other side of my girlfriend 
to gather her in a fierce huge, head rested on one shoulder and 
silently weeping. Not tears of pain or grief, I could tell. But tears 
of joy... relief might be the best word to use here. I could 
literally feel that the tension dominating our lives for so long in 
so many ways evaporate. My heart surely felt a few pounds lighter 
than before.
	&quot;Arigato, Hotaru-chan. I cannot say how much that means to 
me...&quot; Usagi had lifted her head slightly and was now staring in 
Hotaru&#39;s eyes. The raven-haired girl was just sitting there, somewhat 
perplexed by the intensity of the other blonde. I could have told her 
to expect this. The movements, the body language everything was much 
more relaxed now. Gone was the tension and the heart-wrenching guilt 
written all over her face.
	&quot;Arigato gozaimasu,&quot; I heard Usagi&#39;s whisper again, just a 
moment before she slightly leaned forward and gave Hotaru a peck on 
the lips. I mean it was nothing to worry about actually. In any other 
situation you would have dismissed it as just a friendly kiss, an 
expression of genuine gratitude and liking. Yet by any means I should 
feel jealous. All three of us knew that there was something going on 
and our history with each other was a bit more than platonic. I 
should feel jealous, just a tiny bit, even if there was actually 
nothing to worry about. But I didn&#39;t.
	Instead I just resumed the task of getting some feelings in 
my tired muscles. It was just a second anyway, barely, and I simply 
watched with a tiny smile there. It had been Usagi doing it, not one 
of us.
	Hotaru blushed slightly and Usagi looked over her shoulder at 
me with a question in her eyes that didn&#39;t take a genius to figure 
out. I simply smiled and nodded. The broad smile threatening to split 
her face was more than enough of a reward to me. Whatever had been 
said to her privately by Rei and Mamoru made her better. Made her 
feel much better.
	I bent forward, propped up on my knees and gave her a light 
kiss on the forehead. &quot;Are you feeling better now?&quot; She nodded 
quietly and rested her head on my chest. I caught Hotaru&#39;s eyes and 
winked at her, mouthing a &quot;good job&quot;. My girlfriend just looked 
content and wrapped her arms around our Princess and foremost our 
friend... sister as the chant had said. Yes, sisters. That we were. 
More than that actually.
	We sat like this for awhile, wrapped up in each others&#39; arms. 
The gentle flickering of the candles sending shadows over our faces.
	&quot;That was the best present ever,&quot; Usagi finally spoke, 
looking up first at me and then at Hotaru. Her eyes held a look of 
adoration and gratitude that for some reason made my heart flutter. 
We definitely would have to do something about this soon. Hotaru 
cupped Usagi&#39;s cheek gently. &quot;It was my pleasure, Usagi-chan. And I 
think we all needed this.&quot; She sought out my eyes 
again. &quot;Definitely,&quot; I replied, expressing my own gratitude by 
leaning over and drawing her in for a short but heated kiss.
	When we separated, Usagi had already untangled herself from 
in between us and had stood up. Giving us a warm smile, she 
declared. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know how you are feeling but this thing made 
me hungry.&quot; I looked at Hotaru and we both broke out into laughter. 
Yep, beyond any doubt. Usagi. A bit more of the Usagi at least that 
we had cherished and loved so much before our lives came crashing 
down in a downward spiral. Pushing myself up, I helped Hotaru do 
likewise. &quot;That,&quot; I said, &quot;can be dealt with.&quot;

	An hour later or so, the sun had long since set, and some 
snow was falling outside. After the ceremony, we had quickly gone to 
still our hunger. The meal had been nothing special. None of us was 
really taking Christmas as it was actually supposed to be. What 
counted more for us was the hidden meaning and the get-together of 
family. Our family, even if only us three remained...
	I expected to feel a slight pang at this, however, now there 
was just a tiny bit of nostalgia. Hotaru had been totally right with 
her assumption that we all had needed this as had Usagi been at the 
mall. I had never allowed myself to feel the loss of my friends and 
teammates, had not allowed myself to think about my own failure. They 
had been my responsible too and quite frankly it should be me to feel 
guilty for their deaths. I had been the leader but had only taken 
this mantle again shortly after Galaxia when the Outers had begun to 
regularly join us. By then it was much to late and the structure 
already established. The Princess should not have all this 
responsibility upon her shoulders. The burden was already far too 
heavy, leadership could have been something that I SHOULD have taken 
from her. If only I had remembered my position earlier.
	After that dreadful day I had indulged myself in the task of 
keeping us together, redirecting this responsibility and strengthen 
it to the point there it became almost painful. I had taken a job 
that was more than questionable in order to be there for Usagi and 
Hotaru as best as possible. I could have done a lot more. My name was 
already on the list of several agents. But... Most of it required 
sacrificing a lot of time and most likely moving around. I could not 
afford that. Not if I wanted to be there.
	Yes, we had all profited from being able to say our goodbye. 
I knew now that they were alright. All were happy where they were 
now. I could not quite describe what I felt at seeing them again but 
if not for that dumb rules it surely would have ended in a sappy 
hugging feast. They had all been there, even Rei joined us later and 
Setsuna had hung back a little. Ami and Makoto were obviously an item 
now. The funny thing was all of them had not lost any of their 
memories. And then I say any, I mean ANY. It seemed that our efforts 
were not totally in vain after all.
	Something that Haruka had said had struck me the most. I 
should stop thinking so much like a Senshi and a leader. There were 
only three of us left and no real team to lead. Usagi and Hotaru were 
my equals. It didn&#39;t require me to take all the responsibility. I 
should think more about acting like myself, like Aino Minako and not 
Sailorvenus. There was not that much use anymore for Venus. And had a 
hidden part of us not always wanted to lead a normal life?
	Of course the price was much too high for that but what good 
would it do mourn about something that couldn&#39;t be changed forever? 
Nothing at all. It was that typical bluntness that had made Haruka 
always so incredible charming but the honesty behind her words were 
quite evident. Maybe I really had pushed a little bit too much, 
trying to come about as the big sister of mother figure that I simply 
could not be instead of being the friend Usagi and especially Hotaru 
needed. A friend would have given them more space and not always 
tried to tell them what was best. Okay, i had not been that bad but 
often I was not very close to the term of supportive as well. And 
that lead me into trouble more than once, hence the party a few days 
ago.
	A very particular meeting was even more present in my mind. I 
had taken a brief detour before joining Hotaru and the others. Not 
that I had planned on it but he had been the person that was foremost 
in my mind the moment Hotaru had told me what she planned to do. I 
missed my old friend and partner terribly and hadn&#39;t even noticed 
it...
	After realizing that a few hours before that I had chided 
myself for that forgetfulness. That preoccupied with taking up 
responsibilities I had totally ignored that short stab of pain every 
morning when I woke up alone. Not because I wanted someone there, 
that I could have had if I wanted to. No, I simply missed him there, 
curled atop of my blanket, snoring slightly...
	Artemis had always been there as long as I could remember. 
From the first moment of awaking to my destiny and even further 
before that. In the Silver Millennium we had been partners too. And I 
had just forgotten... No, ignored the pain of his loss. As much as I 
valued my &quot;sisters&quot;, he was as close to me as a brother as possible. 
We had shared so much. Maybe it had been my bit of shutting out what 
had happened. I didn&#39;t want to accept it.
	I still remembered the day though. It had almost cost me my 
life when I saw him being ripped apart. My focus had slipped for a 
moment and had it not been for Saturn and his piercing stare, that 
last intense gaze that reminded me that I still had a duty to perform 
and that this duty would come before anything else, that made me go 
on. Maybe it had even been this quick exchange that had made me 
redouble my efforts after the battle. Subordinating everything to 
the &quot;mission&quot;. I had lived in an illusion and never really realized 
that.
	When I mentioned that Artemis had just laughed in his usual 
manner, a little arrogant and macho that was more trying to appear 
cool than actually being. &quot;You are exaggerating,&quot; he had said. I had 
done a fine job of holding the rest of us together but maybe it was 
now time to start thinking about myself again a little more. I had 
protested of course... Funny thing, actually. Usually in the past 
this discussion would have gone the other way round. It was only 
after Haruka had reinforced his statement later that I began to 
believe it. Maybe it was really time to loosen up a little.
	I picked up the plate of cookies and smiled to myself. Dinner 
had been silent, a peaceful and relishing kind of silence. All of us 
had still been thinking about the encounters I think but there was 
nothing of the sad mood present that even in the last days was always 
present somewhere in the back. Now it was time for some sweats and a 
nice evening. We had some movies here - an exquisite and rather up-to-
date collection if I dared say so. And I dared...
	Usagi had already expressed her delight about the collection 
and as I saw it we would probably be stuck with romantic movies the 
whole evening... Not that I minded though. Some of the English stuff 
was actually quite good and even Usagi&#39;s grasp on the language was 
good enough by now that it disposed of any problems there.
	Anyway, I was just back on my way to the living room area and 
as luck would have had it, that was the moment IT was happening. I 
have to say that the luck factor was a lot like describing myself 
since I was responsible for initiating a lot of the following 
encounter. Still I could safely say that I was not totally 
responsible... Not that I would have minded seeing as the outcome was 
one that could not be begrudged.
	Hotaru had apparently been to the bathroom or something and 
Usagi was just coming down the hallway looking for us. She had been 
becoming hungry again, the other blonde had later explained with a 
smile, and wanted to look what was taking me so long with the 
cookies. Be it as it was, the two met in the foyer at the front door, 
more by accident than anything of course. Or as I mentioned earlier, 
as luck would have it.
	Usagi wasn&#39;t really looking when she rounded the corner and 
had nearly run Hotaru over had my girlfriend not quickly caught and 
steadied her. They almost fell over but managed to stay upright 
which - apparently - brought them rather close together. I was coming 
from another hallway - after all this mansion was HUGE - and stopped 
at seeing their faces inches apart, both unmoving and not showing any 
intention of moving anytime soon. I sat down the tray and quietly 
leaned against the wall of the entrance to the foyer, watching.
	You can deny the existence of &quot;magical moments&quot; all you want 
but I already had my fair share of those lately and this was 
definitely one of them. Once again I asked myself why I didn&#39;t feel 
jealous, why I wasn&#39;t interrupting this moment that could be 
dangerous to my relationship with Hotaru. The answer I came up with 
was simple, so surprisingly simple I would have gasped if I wasn&#39;t 
refraining from making any kind of sound. It was not endangering my 
relationship.
	For whatever reason ever, Usagi had become more to me than a 
best friend, a princess and so many more things I cherished her for. 
Those nightly encounters were labeled &quot;favors&quot; but as much as this 
was true, hadn&#39;t there been some kind of illusion in this term as 
well?
	Yes, I had loved Hotaru then - still did and ever would - but 
Usagi hadn&#39;t been a replacement and for some reason I was sure I 
wasn&#39;t just a replacement for Mamoru either. There was a genuine 
affection between all of us Senshi and especially us Senshi towards 
our Princess and friend. An affection that easily could turn into 
love. Maybe I just had not let myself realize that. Maybe I was as 
much denying myself the pleasure of happiness as Usagi had been. And 
Usagi... Her heart was big enough to swallow the whole world if she 
wanted to. Surely there was enough space beside Mamoru. And I would 
never want to take away that memory anyway. That was why I didn&#39;t 
feel threatened by this, I... WANTED it to happen. Wow.
	It was a love born out of desperation, we all had kind of 
latched onto the only thing still present. Our hearts had joined that 
moment after watching our friends being slaughtered. It was a dark 
kind of joining but a genuine one nevertheless. Something had been 
formed between us and had eventually drawn us back together. This, 
the scene in front of me, it had to happen. I knew that with an 
absolute clarity. This was meant to happen, our new and most likely 
last chance at happiness. This way none of us would be left out.
	Sadly the other two weren&#39;t quite complying. The moment 
apparently broken by some comment from Usagi, they were about to pull 
away. I reacted on instinct alone. My gaze swept upwards and surely 
there it was. The very thing that had become kind of a symbol for 
dramatic moments in the last days. I had put it there, right over the 
entrance on a whim before setting up the ritual. Until now, I had not 
really known why. After the party fiasco I had sworn myself to never 
have one of those put up, not if I could help it at least.
	Just as the two women were about to let go of each other, I 
cleared my throat, making both of them freeze and slowly look around. 
At least they didn&#39;t jump. I pointed upwards with a mischievous smile 
and with a wink called out: &quot;Mistletoe!&quot;

&lt;From the Diaries of Tomoe Hotaru&gt;
Maybe, just maybe it hadn&#39;t been so bad after all that I had gone to 
THAT party.
	Safely I could say that this Christmas was the best of my 
life so far. And that from someone who had said that Christmas in 
Japan was a hoax that ignored the actual meaning. Okay, I admit, the 
example of a party thrown by a bunch of... I will not go there since 
my girlfriend was one of them not so long ago and as I said, maybe it 
wasn&#39;t so bad after all. The outcome I mean, not the party. The party 
was bad and... err, am I rambling? Kami, you cannot blame me for 
feeling a little lightheaded after the purification ceremony and the 
ritual later on. Not to forget THAT moment.
	&quot;And there you thought I would have learned by now how to be 
not that clumsy.&quot; That comment from Usagi had effectually broken the 
spell that we had found ourselves in. It was really pure coincidence 
that we had met there but the emotions that had suddenly taken 
supreme control were as clear as the blue sky. We had this moments 
once in awhile but never that intense, not that clear. And for a 
brief instant I had actually considered just letting go. I was about 
to lean forward and just do what my heart told me to do, not even 
wasting a thought about the possible consequences. Minako wouldn&#39;t 
hold me against it, she understood perfectly well, right?
	Perhaps it was better that Usagi spoke up when she did. Or so 
I had thought at that moment. Though a part of me was disappointed at 
the wasted opportunity I still wasn&#39;t too sure about all of this. And 
that evening had went so well until then, how could I have 
jeopardized that.
	So I was about to let go with a chuckle. &quot;Yeah, someone could 
think you are fourteen again.&quot; Usagi simply smiled, still none of us 
had let go. &quot;Chibiusa had almost nine hundred years to grow up.&quot; I 
would have laughed at that if it hadn&#39;t seemed so inappropriate for 
the moment, so I settled for a broad smile. The comment did the trick 
though and I was about to really pull back... Of course that was when 
Minako decided to play Cupid or... whatever.
	D&Atilde;&copy;j&Atilde;&nbsp; vu moments are something rare. I think everyone knows 
that. But that one. Phew, understatement much? I had frozen at the 
mentioning of what could very well be described as our personal Yin 
Yang. Good and bad had come out of this damnable thing and I could 
just not make my mind up if I loved or totally despised of it. At 
that moment when I slowly looked up in unison with Usagi, I tended 
more to the latter. My grip had tightened around the other girl&#39;s 
waist. Sure enough there was a mistletoe hanging right over our heads 
and I had not put it there.
	It took a few seconds but our eyes finally met again and my 
breath surely must have been caught in my throat. I am not a very 
emotional person, not very poetic either. But I think this was when 
realization finally hit me. I needed to do this, it was driving me 
crazy the more I thought about and avoided it... whatever it was. 
Somehow this was meant to happen.
	Yet I was still scared, a part of me screamed at me that I 
would ultimately shatter everything I had accomplished over the space 
of the last days. I would lose Usagi&#39;s friendship and the girl would 
surely lose even more, trust would be broken. I would lose Minako, 
she would never forgive me for this betrayal, right in front of her 
eyes. The fact that she just now had initiated this herself didn&#39;t 
matter at all. And Usagi was scared too, I could read it clearly in 
her eyes, the tension had returned unbidden and both of us were torn 
between the need to follow our impulses and the fear of the 
consequences.
	Once again it had been Minako who had moved over to us 
without any of us noticing. I was so caught up in the moment that I 
nearly shrieked as I felt one arm slip around my shoulders and seeing 
another around Usagi&#39;s. It was just a gentle nudge but enough for 
both us to lean closer a little. Enough for the little distance 
remaining to be overcome and our lips caress. Just a caress. For an 
endless moment nothing more than that. Then instincts took over and I 
pulled my Princess and friend closer. Whatever wall had been 
preventing me from following my instincts was torn down by Minako&#39;s 
open encouragement to go ahead.
	Those tiny gestures of trust and immediate understanding what 
the other wanted and felt, that is what I cherished the most. I did 
not feel any jealousy or such a thing from my girlfriend. Far from 
that. Suddenly there was a feeling of peace sinking down like a 
gentle blanket. I deepened the kiss and Usagi responded in surrender, 
a low moan rising from her throat.
	Still, it was not really complete. Something was missing, a 
tiny but important bit... We finally parted, air becoming a serious 
issue. Recovery was not granted though. I had wanted to say 
something, anything but found myself unable to do, as Minako leaned 
over and captured a surprised Usagi&#39;s lips with her own. The exchange 
was a lot briefer but no less genuine and I simply watched.
	What was happening here was fleeing repeatedly from my grasp. 
This could not be described as anything simply romantic or magical or 
whatever you wanted to use. I could feel the missing pieces come 
together and instead of jealousy I relished in the sight of the now 
open display of love between my... girlfriends. It was so... I don&#39;t 
know, fulfilling seeing them like this. It made me feel good and that 
was the part I couldn&#39;t grasp. How could I feel good at my current 
girlfriend kissing my one-time and probably once again lover... This 
was just too bizarre to figure out and so I simply did not.
	Usagi opened her mouth to speak but Minako had put a finger 
on her lips, gently teasing. &quot;Shh, don&#39;t ruin it.&quot; Minako leaned over 
to softly kiss me too and this time I did not hesitate to follow the 
impulse. Bathing in the reassuring display of love from the blonde I 
pulled my other friend in with one arm still around her waist. Usagi 
gave a surprise yelp and the following procedure was a little hard to 
do. We managed though. Instinctively we knew how to position 
ourselves for this somewhat awkward three-way kiss but it worked.
	It all fell away.
	All the doubt, the fear, the pain, the grief of the last 
years fell away, replaced by an incredible feeling of belonging that 
I never wanted to let go of again. I swore to myself that moment that 
I never wanted to let it go again. This was where I belonged, where I 
was meant to be. Maybe once, before all this, it had been different. 
Perhaps then it had just been Minako that I needed, wanted. Not 
anymore. I needed them both, like fire and water. I could not go on 
without either.
	The emotions invoked were so strong it would have knocked me 
off my feet, all of us actually, if we hadn&#39;t been so entangled. Arms 
tightly around each other, lips still touching in a funny angle that 
I was sure was something to snap a picture of, I allowed myself to 
softly sigh into the contact and felt it echoed immediately. I was 
sure there was some sort of energy around us from the intensity of it 
all and could anyone have seen us... Nobody could see us. And that 
was a good thing because that moment was for us and us alone.
	As we finally parted I almost whimpered at the loss of 
contact, the warmth a little less, a little coldness creeping into my 
body again... But the solution was only a few inches away. Just a 
short distance and it would be complete again, the warmth would be 
there again, enveloping us...
	Apparently I hadn&#39;t been the only one thinking along such 
lines and whatever had taken control of us was responding. This time 
the kiss was a lot less awkward, felt just... right. I had closed my 
eyes and enjoyed the caress of lips. Carefully I snaked my tongue out 
between my teeth and found two others already waiting. The contact 
sent an electric shock akin to a few thousand volt through all of us. 
The wave sweeping from one end of the triangle connection to another, 
only stopping when it became too much and we had to pull away again.
	This time I felt a lot more content, just having the other 
two women so close. It was enough this time. Our foreheads fell 
forward to rest on each others&#39; shoulders. Mine on Minako&#39;s, Usagi&#39;s 
on mine and Minako&#39;s on Usagi&#39;s. We stood there like that for a long 
time, neither noticing nor caring that it was getting kind of cold 
out here. We had each other and that was all the warmth we needed.
	&quot;Wow,&quot; Usagi had finally muttered. I expected some kind of 
question, reassuring that it was okay, that none of us regretted 
giving in right there. I could not blame her that it didn&#39;t come. 
Nobody could have doubted the sincerity of our connection after that 
intensity. If I concentrated hard enough I could feel the echoes of 
Usagi and Minako&#39;s thoughts...
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; I managed to croak out. &quot;Wow.&quot; Then I lifted my head 
slight from Minako&#39;s shoulder and looked at her suspiciously. &quot;That 
was your idea, wasn&#39;t it? Hanging that thing up there?&quot; The blonde 
smiled sweetly. &quot;Whatever do you mean? I have no idea where it came 
from.&quot; Playfully I poked her in the side and Usagi did the same, the 
other blonde - hell, that going to be confusing, those two could pass 
as twins at times - giggled. &quot;Maybe we should move someday or we are 
stuck here for the whole evening.&quot;
	&quot;Hm,&quot; I purred, briefly looking up at the lone mistletoe 
above us. &quot;I don&#39;t think I can.&quot; Minako nodded. &quot;Me neither.&quot; And 
with that we leaned in for another exchange of short kisses. I 
trailed a finger along Minako&#39;s cheek. &quot;You realize that you got us 
into this, right? And if we can&#39;t move here we can&#39;t get to sleep at 
all.&quot; Usagi looked confused at Minako&#39;s yelp of &quot;eep&quot; and the blush 
that quickly turned scarlet. &quot;Private joke,&quot; I said to her and sent 
her an image of Minako&#39;s departure a few hours ago.
	She broke out into hysterical laughter which finally managed 
to break the spell enough for us to move. &quot;You guys are 
unbelievable!&quot; she declared but still slipped an arm around both of 
us and dragged us back into the living room.
	People say that triads as they are often called never work 
out in the end. That is pure feeble-minded thinking. The trust and 
openness between us is testament enough and even though we are just 
standing at the threshold to this new relationship I can already say 
that a lack of trust will not become an issue. Oh I can safely agree 
that reaching this point is hard work. If you have mastered the 
barrier once though, the reward is incredible. Even as I am writing 
this down I can still hardly believe that those two incredible women, 
a princess and the Senshi&#39;s leader no less, want to be with me, share 
their love with me. Me of all people. But I will not doubt it any 
longer. I am content with where we are right now and that is the only 
important thing.
	So, sure a triad is a tough thing to accomplish and if you 
rush into it I can imagine how quickly it could fall apart because of 
missing trust and jealousy. However, we don&#39;t have this. Of course, 
the next days will show how the mechanics will work, this is new 
ground for all of us after all. On the other side I can not think of 
a time where I ever have felt that completed and if I feel like this, 
I am sure they do as well.
	It is nearing midnight... No, wait it is already past that, 
ugh... I&#39;m lying here on the big couch, Minako on the other side and 
Usagi curled up between us and I think that life is now really 
looking up again. The last hours resolved so many things. I am no 
fool. I know how much the events of the last days, even the painful 
ones contributed to this outcome. Now though, after such a long time 
we have finally found our peace again. The memory of our friends 
would forever stay with us but we have finally managed to regain 
control of our lives again and put the past behind us. Together we 
can look forward again without the sorrow always clouding and 
determining our actions. Having the two women so close makes me smile 
every time I look up and study one or both of them.
	And with that I&#39;m better closing this entry. We really should 
get to bed. Only sleeping though. We all are feeling rather drained 
after the ceremony and the emotional turmoil. I would love to explore 
this new possibilities but seeing as the other two are already dozing 
peacefully and none of us has paid that much attention to the latest 
movie, sleep was probably the best thing now. We had time anyway, the 
whole next week if we wanted to. None of us had any better to do.
	I am in love now, with two incredible women and I can barely 
grasp it. But it&#39;s a good thing. The best thing that ever happened to 
me. Maybe, maybe the concept isn&#39;t so hollow after all and maybe the 
world will look a little brighter tomorrow. One thing is for sure, 
the three of us would stay together. That is there we belong now. 
Every obstacle will be mastered together. Hopefully this time that 
happiness will last.

Hotaru
&lt;End Entry&gt;

	I put away the diary and untangled myself from the other two 
women, but not before placing a soft kiss on both their foreheads. 
Usagi mumbled a little in her sleep at the loss of warmth from one 
side and snuggled a little closer to Minako. Her new look was still 
needing some getting used to. But she looked cute with that braid.
	They were sleeping peacefully now. Even Usagi, I could tell. 
Perhaps tonight the nightmares would finally not haunt me anymore as 
well. I had found my happiness, more than I had ever thought to 
receive or deserve. Six years ago I had felt so cheap and violated. 
And lonely, I had felt impossible lonely. I think I understood now 
why. I had taken the wrong way, choosing to stay away from my friends 
than I should have gone to them with my problems and my pain. We all 
had in a way. Even though Usagi and Minako had taken comfort in each 
other, in a way they had been shied away from each other as well. 
There it mattered they had closed off their hearts.
	All that did not matter right now, it did not matter 
anymore. &quot;You shape your own futures now&quot;, Pluto had said to me 
during our visit in the Elysium Fields. &quot;The Princess asked me once 
if the future was set in stone. It is not. It never has been. There&#39;s 
nothing right or wrong with this future. It is what you make out of 
your lives, your present that has always determined the flow of time 
and the future that will come.&quot; Perhaps that had been a part of our 
problem. We had lived in the past a little too much. Maybe we had 
lost sight of the present and that is why the future we had worked so 
hard for did not come. Maybe that had been the price.
	Whether that was true or not, we - Usagi, Minako and I - had 
left our past behind today. It would not be gone from our memories 
and the memories would always be treasured, old feelings and hardship 
could and would come back to haunt us. As long as we had each other, 
however, I was sure that we would make it through anything life 
throws at us. After having endured so much, how could we not?
	I had watched the snow outside falling while my thoughts 
wandered. It hadn&#39;t stopped since Minako came back with Usagi and 
that was a long time ago. The blanket of white was already thickening 
and tomorrow the sight would surely been delightful. Yes, it would be 
a great holiday, I decided.
	I was about to turn back towards the sleeping women when I 
looked down and realized that there was another lone mistletoe lying 
on the windowsill. For a moment I stared at the thing, then smiled 
and returned to the couch. Next to it stood our little Christmas Tree 
that was not oversized, tiny actually compared to the size of the 
mansion but lovely nonetheless. Fastening the mistletoe around a 
branch that hang over the two blondes, I slipped back next to Usagi 
and snuggled up to them. I think I loved them after all, those 
mistletoes.

When you get caught in the rain with no where to run
When you&#39;re distraught and in pain without anyone 
When you keep crying out to be saved 
But nobody comes and you feel so far away 
That you just can&#39;t find your way home 
You can get there alone 
It&#39;s okay, what you say is 
I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I&#39;m strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 
And if you keep falling down don&#39;t you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you&#39;ll find what you need to prevail 
What you say is 

I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I&#39;m strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith 
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 

And when the rain blows, as shadows grow close don&#39;t be afraid 
There&#39;s nothing you can&#39;t face 
And should they tell you you&#39;ll never pull through 
Don&#39;t hesitate, stand tall and say 

I can make it through the rain 
I can stand up once again on my own 
And I know that I&#39;m strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith 
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain 

I can make it through the rain
And I live once again
And I live one more day 
And I can make it through the rain 
(Yes you can) 
You will make it through the rain

Final Notes

Phew, I. Am. Finished. *pant* Wow...
	Honestly now, THAT was the quickest &quot;longer&quot; fic I have ever 
written, nearly seventy-five pages (Arial, 12 pt) in under a month! 
Wow. And now I&#39;m finally finished and it feels good to be so. Really. 
I have so many fics I like to have finished but can&#39;t because I have 
so many... Does that even make sense? Anyway, I finished it and I&#39;m 
glad about it.
	What started out as my simple, usual Christmas story I had 
been doing the last two years now (until now only in my native 
language, being German), I became quickly enthralled with the darker 
nature because I hadn&#39;t done anything quite like that before. Some 
came close but never like this. It fascinated me and the plot managed 
to somehow evolve on its own, evolve in a monster that I had a hard 
time controlling but that Maia seemed to have LOVED for all it was 
worth. Maia is my muse by the way...
	So I couldn&#39;t stop and before I realized it pages after pages 
were written and it became longer and longer with the end always 
drawn out a little more. Just around the corner but never quite in 
reachable distance.
	I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t even want to hear that.

	The general darkness of the fic was intended. However, the 
intensity and the sometimes morbid-fascinating way of expressing it 
was a sole origin of the swirling set of ideas that Maia popped into 
my head. *glares at muse* I did not mean to offend anyone and I think 
that I can safely say with the rating and the numerous warnings in 
the header, nobody can accuse me of leading you on, giving you the 
false pretense that this was only mildly dark. So no flames about 
this please, ok? *smiles sweetly*
	The ritual is my own creation, based on information about the 
Greek Mythology of Hades. That was provided by the Encyplopedia. 
(http://www.slider.com/enc/index.htm)
	Miisha and Janerin were the ice-skating couple that had shown 
in up in Season One of BSSM.

	Since I&#39;m sure after such a long read you don&#39;t want to 
listen to all my insane rambling, I&#39;m trying to cut this as short as 
possible and simple give credit. Because like they say: Honor to whom 
honor is due. And I realized while writing this story that there were 
quite a few authors whose work had a striking influence on this one.

	Foremost there is Mad-Hamlet (Buffy/Willow author) and his 
magnificent series of Prisms, Forge, Feather Roads and Sundowning. 
His POV style is splendid in a way I could only dream of ever 
achieving. But his series in which he deals with the delicate topic 
of Willow being raped had a tremendous influence on the turn of 
events. It was to no small factor that I had reread his work while 
writing this, that this fic turned out as it has.
	Look up http://nearheralways.com/willow_buffy for his work.

	The mechanics of working out a Triad go back on a longer list 
of Buffy/Willow/Tara fics. Among those especially the works of Frau 
Hunter Ash who did a wonderful job with her Red Moon series. I had 
not thought the concept of a three-way relationship could be handled 
so seriously and believable before I read her work. My approach might 
be vastly different but she still had her influence here and there.
	Look up http://www.hunterash.com.

	Then I have to give thanks to TheBear (yet another great 
author from the list), who kindly let me borrow a really tiny quote 
and idea from her work issued in &quot;Triune&quot; (part of a longer 
Buffy/Willow/Tara series).
	Look up http://www.papa-bear.com.

	There might be some subconscious influences from Tim Nolan&#39;s 
work which I also read while writing this. For it being so old, I can 
say that I loved the style how he worked with the SM Universe in his 
series &quot;Awakenings&quot;, &quot;Obligations&quot; and the &quot;End of the Beginning&quot;. 
Every true fan should take a look at it.
	Look up http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Ginza/7876/.

	And last but not least I like to thank the people from my 
Minaru-list who have endured chapter postings over the last month. 
And foremost of course my current beta Ayrki (though we are both much 
too busy to do any serious betaing at the moment). You&#39;re kind words 
and praise to my work were really helping in getting this finished. I 
would have not blamed if you would have &quot;run away screaming&quot; :) but 
you endured it all and always gave me helpful feedback. If we ever 
manage to do this co-work thing, this surely will get interesting.
	You can find her own work on ff.net.

	It&#39;s over one o&#39;clock in the morning now and even though I 
have the entire next week and a half free from work, I try to have at 
least a somewhat normal bedtime (other than someone I know). I hope 
you all enjoyed this fic despite the harshness of the plot at several 
points. If you do, please drop me a line at least (addy is in the 
header). We authors depend on feedback after all. You can deny it all 
you want but just liking your work and knowing that you did a good 
job, doing it for personal joy (which is essential too, don&#39;t get me 
wrong), is - forgive me the bluntness - utter bullshit. We need 
feedback. Be it only a short line that you liked/disliked it or 
something more constructive. It only takes a few minutes to do, or a 
bit more if you have the time but be assured that your feedback is 
appreciated and will in the most cases be answered too as well (and 
quickly).
	I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year out 
there. I hope you enjoy the holiday season whether it&#39;s freezing cold 
and you have to tiptoe on iced streets (like us the last days) or it 
is forty degrees hot (like in Australia where Ayrki is dwelling). Or 
maybe it&#39;s just plain normal weather. My best wishes for you and now 
I&#39;m FINALLY putting an end to this or I will still be sitting here in 
the morning.

Ja ne, yours
