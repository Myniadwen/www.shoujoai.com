<h1>Sailor Moon Remastered (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/smr-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>What came before -- 5 years ago --

The world was changing yet again.

The ruined city was surrounded by Winterian Frigates and Destroyers. 
Ground troops already controlled most of the city with only the main 
tower remaining.

The reign of darkness was over, but even as first dawn over the once 
corrupted city came over it&#39;s shattered landscape, it was not yet over.

&quot;What would you do if every time you fell in love with someone you had 
to say good-bye?&quot;

As the last shuttle prepared to depart, the architect of this darkness 
climbed into his escape craft, surveying what was once his. &quot;Bitches.&quot; 
he grumbled, &quot;Where did they all come from?&quot;

As the shuttle lifted free from what was once his fortress, something 
quick moved towards the shuttle, leaping into the air to grab the open 
hatchway as it closed.

&quot;What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be 
there?&quot;

A hand grabbed his shoulder, pulling him back into the half open hatch, 
her face half bloodied, half gone revealing the shiny metallic endo 
skeleton beneath. She was a Cyberroid trooper, but more importantly she 
was his Cyberroid. Built to make his fun with his &quot;girls&quot; he held that 
much more pleasant, until she grew a damnable &quot;conscience&quot; and became 
his enemy. &quot;NO YOU DON&#39;T!!&quot; she screamed, pulling at him, &quot;NOT AGAIN!! 
NOT AGAIN!!&quot;

As they struggled the building behind them fell away, two other 
shuttles departing from lower levels exploding as fighters strafed 
them, knocking them back into the shattered husk of the tower.

&quot;What would you do if for every moment you were truly happy there would 
be 10 moments of sadness?&quot;

She grabbed his clothes tight, and shoved backwards, pulling himself 
and her into the dark void, both falling away towards the dark Earth 
below. Seconds later three shots ripped through the hull of the shuttle 
blowing it apart into a million fiery pieces.

&quot;What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got 
to tell them how you felt?&quot;

&quot;You bitch! We&#39;re going to die!!&quot; he screamed, but if that was to shake 
her up or distress her it did no such thing. She simply stared at the 
ground far below and muttered to herself as it slowly rose towards 
them.

&quot;I should be so lucky.&quot;

&quot;What would you do if you loved someone more than anything else and you 
could never have them?&quot;

He lashed out, catching her attention. With a mighty swing she 
backhanded him into the side of the tower, glass shattering as he hit 
the fractured surface of the once smooth abomination, his body bouncing 
off the glass over and over again cutting him open as it did. Yet, 
bloodied as he was, he managed to push back towards her fists swinging.

&quot;Some people live and some people die.&quot;

She caught his arms and they struggled, gripped in hate for the other, 
as they fell silently downwards with only the tinkle of broken glass 
and the whoosh of the wind accompanying them down.

&quot;But I want to tell you I love you and you are a true friend...&quot;

The ground sped up to them, and the last thing she thought before it 
hit was this--

&quot;That I will always be here for you when and if you need me...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry--&quot;she thought, eyes downwards as the darkness rushed right 
at them.

&quot;If I died tomorrow, you would be in my heart forever. Would I be in 
yours?&quot;

Her last thought -- &quot;Forgive me.&quot;

Silence and darkness. That was supposed to have been her end. Yet, five 
years later, she was still &quot;alive&quot;.

As Makomi carefully brushed the few hairs from Grace&#39;s sleeping face, 
she wondered how she came to this. She had known Grace for four years, 
since the day she stopped the other girl from committing suicide. She 
had loved her for the longest time, yet only a few weeks ago have they 
become this intimate. Still, how this beautiful creature could love a 
girl with a machine&#39;s biodrive for a heart, a wetware organic computer 
system for a brain, and organic steel for bones didn&#39;t make sense to 
her.

But she couldn&#39;t live without Grace. She was her dawn, her sunlight, 
and her beautiful evening respite. She was everything to her, and she 
couldn&#39;t imagine life without her. Her &quot;mama&quot;, her &quot;papa&quot;, her beloved. 
They were her life, and she would do anything to protect them and her 
friends. Anything.

As she tried to fall back to sleep, she wondered if she would ever put 
her past behind her.

The Present

Obviously this story was going to go on for a while yet, but Eve had 
other obligations.

Eve slowly rises to her feet, waving off Haruka&#39;s stares. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you 
know it? I have to go. Nina&#39;s going to be pissy if I&#39;m not back for the 
Clow Card report and--&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll only take a little bit more,&quot; she growled, pushing Eve/Hotaru 
back into the couch and glaring at her. 

Michiru smiled, and whispered, &quot;Little Hotaru tried that one and she 
failed too.&quot;

&quot;As I was saying--&quot;

----

One day ago.

It was quite clear in Haruka&#39;s memory.

Yesterday as she and Michiru were passing the arcade they ran into 
Usagi and the others.

They were going to Rei&#39;s place to study, and somehow Haruka talked 
Michiru into going along.

&quot;Your only in it for the food.&quot; she whispered, head held up a bit as
she walked next to Haruka. It was true, after all, since Mako-chan was 
doing the food for the &quot;study buddies&quot; meet who wouldn&#39;t have dropped 
everything to sample her fine cooking skills? Admittedly, after five 
years, Haruka had become rather attached to Mako-chan&#39;s superb meals 
and never argued about going anyplace (as long as she was cooking).
She liked Michiru&#39;s cooking, but there was something about Mako-chan&#39;s 
meals that -- well, sufficient to say Michiru occasionally becomes a 
tad jealous when the topic of Mako-chan&#39;s cooking comes up.

It was as they were passing through the park that it happened.

Two girls in front of the group were suddenly set upon by several 
strange reptilian beasts colored in a dark green shade. Usagi, first in 
line, pointed at them and screamed &quot;T-Rexes--&quot; (and promptly got 
whacked in the head by Rei who growled &quot;Raptors!!&quot;)

&quot;They&#39;re Galerians.&quot; Ami mumbled, her attention focused on the strange 
reptiles. Sure enough, as they moved one could see the fine skullcap 
and spine molding of cybernetic circuitry which betrayed their alien 
origins. Through their rippling muscles they could also see hints of 
cybernetic augmentations, which also gave away their non-dinosaur 
lineage. From the trees another one of these creatures, whose hard 
reptilian skin was blood red, jumped into the clearing ahead of the 
girls and bared it&#39;s teeth. From it&#39;s wetware on it&#39;s head a loud yet 
droning artificial voice rang out. &quot;THIS UNIT HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 
YOUR TERMINATION. THERE WILL BE NO ROOM FOR APPEAL. TERMINATION TO 
BEGIN IN 10 SECONDS.&quot;

All the drone units turned on Usagi and the other girls, jaws opening 
as they powered up (their eyes burning bright and the inside of their 
mouths glowing).

&quot;I think they&#39;re getting ready to use their bio-weapons on us.&quot; Ami 
announced, deeply fascinated by their movements and motions. Mako-chan, 
glancing over at Ami, scowled, &quot;This isn&#39;t the time to be impressed!&quot;

Minako pulled her top open a bit, shoving her hand into her blouse, 
&quot;Everyone! Let&#39;s Mo--&quot;

She stopped, and blushed.

&quot;What? Minako-chan!!&quot; Usagi prodded, until she gasped, &quot;I forgot my 
transformation pen at home! (I&#39;m just groping myself, there&#39;s nothing 
in my hidden pocket to retrieve!)&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t bring mine.&quot; Mako-chan admitted, which brought a nod in the 
affirmative from Ami. Usagi scowled in Rei&#39;s direction, &quot;Well SOMEBODY 
made me leave my transformation gear at home with her stuff in a 

display case in our bedroom!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s supposed to be an age of peace! Who would have thought we needed 
them like this?!?&quot;

Haruka blushed, noticing that all eyes had turned in their direction. 
&quot;I don&#39;t have mine.&quot;

&quot;We have to tear apart our bed because last night we used ours to--&quot;

Usagi covers her ears, while Rei takes mental notes (listening with an 
apt attention and wide eyes).

Suddenly a blue streak cut across the creature&#39;s path, cutting it&#39;s 
face. The countdown stopped as everyone looked about, only for the 
silence to be broken by a soft sad tune being played out on a guitar.

&quot;What&#39;s that--?&quot; Minako said, &quot;It can&#39;t be--&quot;

&quot;It is.&quot; Rei sighed, head lowered. &quot;It&#39;s her.&quot;

Usagi, looking about as confused as the Galerian Assassins, started to 
panic. &quot;Where is she? Where is--?&quot; (pak) &quot;Are you some stereotypical 
bad guy? Stop acting up!&quot; Rei yelled (after hitting Usagi), getting 
Usagi riled up if only for a second. 

All eyes turned towards King Penguin, where a young woman dressed in 
blue/green clothes (from coat to dress clothes and pants) with black 
boots and gloves to accentuate, was slowly strumming out the tune as 
she watched. The lead creature looked at her, reptilian eyes narrowing 
as it stared. &quot;You.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s safe to say you want me, right?&quot;

It hunkered down, claws at the ready and tail whipping the air in a 
frenzy. &quot;Get her! Get her!! GET HER!!&quot; it&#39;s cold mechanical voice 
screamed.

The creature spun about, ignoring the girls, and attacked. Two of the 
creatures however didn&#39;t make it as Haruka rushed forward to knock one 
back and rip the second one down with her sword. As the first one rose 
to meet her she quickly hacked it&#39;s head off. Michiru was at her side 
in an instant. &quot;So you forgot your transformation pen but brought your 
sword in your pocket tesseract?&quot;

&quot;You lost your transformation pen too so don&#39;t get preachy with me.&quot; 
Haruka countered.

Makomi leaped down into the fray, kicking away one Assassin drone and 
back kicking away a second one. As she fought the creatures their 
&quot;master&quot; screeched at them to fight harder as it watched from afar. But 
it was soon apparent that they were no match for her. As she wrapped 
the drones up she quickly leaped back onto the top of King Penguin.

&quot;Well,&quot; Usagi sighed, watching the fight from afar. &quot;She didn&#39;t bring 
her&#39;s either so we&#39;re even.&quot;

From her coat she pulled her transformation amulet out, holding it 
forward as she knelt to jump. &quot;Mercury Trooper Cosmic Power, MAKE UP!!&quot;
As she leapt forward she barely dodged a bio-weapon attack from the 
lead Galerian, it&#39;s power blast skimming beneath her as she transformed 
in mid air, landing next to her target as Trooper Mercury. In this form 
she wore Mercury&#39;s Sailor Solider uniform with touched up appearance 
here and there giving it it&#39;s own unique look (which was readily 
apparent if stared at by the casual Sailor Moon fanatic).

The creature, eyes locked on her, was furious. It leaped forward 
swinging it&#39;s rear legs rapidly at her trying to claw her up. She 
quickly leaped over it, landing behind it as it used it&#39;s tail to try 
and knock her down. The first swing knocked her off her feet, but a 
quick recovery put her back on those feet again. Infuriated, it jumped 
at her with all claws extended. She quickly slipped to one side, and 
pummeled it with kicks at it landed behind her. She then quickly 
grabbed it&#39;s tail and yanked it upwards, &quot;Hurricane Spin!&quot; she cried 
out, focusing her energy towards spinning to disorient the creature. As 
she let go it slammed into the ground and bounced a few times before 
landing face down in the grass. She was quickly on it before it could 
recover, lashing out with more kicks before closing with a punishing 
back-kick called &quot;Scyther Kick&quot; which shattered the wetware components 
on it&#39;s head and spine stunning it into silence.

She quickly dropped back, holding her right hand back as she drew power 
into her open palm. As the power built to full she fell to one knee and 
thrust her right hand forward, screaming &quot;AQUATIC RETRIBUTION!&quot; which 
unleashed a great deal of energy. The resulting &quot;shot&quot; disintegrated 
the creature, blowing it apart before their eyes.

As Mako-chan saw to the two girls that were originally assaulted by the 
creatures, Haruka pouted to one side with sword in hand. &quot;She did quite 
a good job.&quot; Michiru whispered, but if that was to set Haruka&#39;s mind at 
ease it did nothing of the sort. She was angry, and Makomi was the one 
she blamed.

That&#39;s when Minako noticed somebody was watching from behind.

However all Makomi could think of was -- &quot;I hate this skirt.&quot; she 
grumbled, tugging at it, &quot;Every move constitutes a panty flash with 
this thing on (whatever happened to good sturdy pants!)&quot;

----

&quot;That would have been Keiko observing from a distance.&quot; Eve/Hotaru 
admitted. &quot;She told me about that fight when I saw her later on that 
day.&quot;

&quot;Oh she did, did she,&quot; Haruka growled, her sore feelings still no 
better since yesterday. &quot;I bet she was all pleased as all heck that 
Makomi is so well into her &quot;act&quot; as she is.&quot;

&quot;She was more interested in the creature than Makomi&#39;s performance, 
though she did speak with a bit of pride in her voice about that--&quot;

&quot;See?&quot; Haruka complained, only to be gently shushed by Michiru to allow 
Eve/Hotaru to speak. &quot;She said that creature yesterday was an Assassin 
Guilder codenamed Carnage. It&#39;s Prime Drone quite a feisty opponent not 
to be underestimated.&quot;

&quot;Prime Drone?&quot; Michiru asked, to which Eve/Hotaru explained &quot;That means 
it&#39;s a prime surrogate for the real entity. You see that a lot. The 
real assassins uses a half a dozen Prime Drones apiece to do jobs while 
they do their own work half a galaxy away. That way he or she is 
working several jobs and nobody knows the difference between the two 
(the original and the Prime Drone) so they pay the fee as if it was the 
original, which it might as well be since they&#39;re indistinguishable 
from the original.&quot;

&quot;So I see. But--&quot;

The cell phone in Eve&#39;s pocket rings and she quickly stands, &quot;That&#39;ll 
be Nina now. I better go before she becomes anymore irritated. Bye.&quot; 
Before anyone could think of stopping her, Eve was already changed back 
to her &quot;other&quot; self and walking out the door. Outside she clicked on 
the phone as she stepped into the nearest lift elevator. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;This is Pizza-rama confirming your datapad pizza order you just placed 
two minutes ago. Is the order OK?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll see you in 30 minutes, bye.&quot;

As she hangs up the phone she checks the datapad in her pocket, glad 
she pre-set this call just in case she needed an excuse to leave 
without upsetting anyone. &quot;That takes care of lunch.&quot;

-----

That day everyone was to meet at the Tower, to discuss the day&#39;s 
events.

Some were going because of what happened the day before.

Some were just going because Makoto was using the Tower&#39;s extensive 
kitchen and cooking help to whip up a masterpiece in dining and the 
thought of free food appealed to some, even though they were supposed 
to be there for work.

When Ami-chan called Makomi to remind her, she replied in the positive 
but -- &quot;Something&#39;s come up, I might be a little late. What came up? 
Nothing much, just an appointment I have.&quot;

As she turned off her link, she followed a Drone unit, which in turn 
was following four young women.

-----

Pacifica Rim Hospital

The only thing Sakura could think of saying was that Fight should think 
about it.

While it was true that Sakura needed to seal Fight&#39;s power, she didn&#39;t 
want to do it for the wrong reasons. She wanted Fight&#39;s blessings, and 
if it meant waiting a little while longer she was prepared to do so. So 
it was in this state of mind that Sakura, Tomoyo and Eve went with 
Fight so she could speak to her significant other and come to a 
decision on this.

The hospital was beautiful. The huge sprawling complex that was the 
Pacifica Rim Hospital had three huge buildings, which were the medical 
complexes and patient recovery center. In the center of the three 
building complex was a giant park dubbed the Starlight Gardens, where 
patients and visitors alike took time to recover both physically and 
spiritually from what ailed them.

The patient recovery center was to one side of the huge park, and 
that&#39;s where Fight had to go. As the four crossed through the park, 
admiring the beautiful shade trees and lovely pond, Fight felt 
something was amiss. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong.&quot; she said, eyes glancing about 
nervously, &quot;Something&#39;s not right.&quot;

Suddenly something sped past the edge of her eyesight, barely catching 
her attention. Before she could spin about she felt a sharp pain as 
something impacted into her back sending her crashing to her knees. A 
second blow knocks her side over side into the ground, stunned. As 
Sakura and Tomoyo rush to her aid, a man in dark black armor steps out 
into the light and regards the group. &quot;So that&#39;s a Clow Card human.&quot; he 
said, glancing at her casually, &quot;Not impressed.&quot;

Before Sakura could utter a single word the four of them found 
themselves surrounded by a half a dozen armored beings, each a perfect 
match for the first one that confronted them. &quot;Assassin Guilder&#39; 
Drones.&quot; Eve rasped, eyes glancing back and forth at the Drones as she 
knelt next to Sakura/Tomoyo to protect them. &quot;You must be Raptor 
Guild.&quot;

&quot;I guess so--&quot; the leader remarked idly, tapping the insignia of a 
leaping velociraptor on the left breastplate of his armor, &quot;I am 
Decauter. With Ravage &quot;dysfunctionally deactivated&quot; that makes me the 
new head of the Guild doesn&#39;t it. But, to the point, assassination is 
not the goal here today--&quot; (holds up hypo) &quot;-- simply DNA extraction.&quot; 
(two of the Drone units hauls Fight up onto her feet, holding her 
tight) &quot;I&#39;d be very interested in seeing the kind of tightly wound DNA 
you have in your body. And then I&#39;d like to see if any of that DNA 
rubbed off on your boy toy in the hospital--&quot;

&quot;Leave him be.&quot; Fight growled, struggling against her captors, but 
still dazed and stunned from the first attack, &quot;Just take what you want 
and leave us alone.&quot;

&quot;I wish it were that simple, but I&#39;m supposed to bring you back and not 
let you go until we figured out what makes you tick--&quot; (taps hypo) 
&quot;--even if it leaves you in a rather-- unreturnable condition. But 
then--&quot;

A soft, sand music fills the air. At this a thin smile forms across 
Decauter&#39;s face, though no one can see it as he&#39;s wearing his armor&#39;s 
helmet. &quot;About time.&quot; quickly Decauter steps back surveying the 
landscape. &quot;Everybody heads up, we have a &quot;Sailor Trooper&quot; in our 
midst.&quot;

&quot;What--?&quot; Fight groans, eyes narrowed as her rage built, the others 
glancing about. Eventually their gazes fall on a young woman in 
blue/green. Her hair short and blue, her clothes a mix of blue and 
green colors from the long coat, to the shirt and pants, with only 
black boots and gloves to add accentuation to her wardrobe. In her 
hands she held a shiny steel guitar which she slowly strummed. Fight 
couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. If only her lover was here right now, 
because this so reminded her of her significant other&#39;s favorite old TV 
show.

&quot;So what does the Guild want with Clow Card DNA.&quot; she slowly 
challenged, eyes locked firmly on Decauter. &quot;Well, traitor, that just 
so happens to be for me to know and you never to find out. Maybe we&#39;ll 
just take her boy toy and leave her behind.&quot; he goaded, which stoked
the already raging fire in Fight&#39;s heart.

As Tomoyo and Sakura looked on, the two combatants braced themselves 
for battle. The drone troopers around them tensing for the blue haired 
woman to make the first move.

Movement was swift on both sides.

As Decauter drew his guns to fire at her, she leaped into the air over 
the gunfire slamming down into the nearest Drone unit knocking it over. 
She then spun about whipping her leg upwards to catch the second 
charging unit, snapping it about and into the ground hard.

Watching her move, Decauter tried to pace her step for step, guns at 
the ready. Every time he fired, she would get out of the way, rolling 
into a Drone while she was at it and taking it down. &quot;Idiots!&quot; Decauter 
screamed, &quot;Damn drone units are never as good as the original once 
they&#39;re cloned too far down the tech-line!&quot; Tomoyo looks over at Eve 
curiously, who smirks slightly, &quot;Drone units are only good when their 
wetware is copied from the original. Clones made from Prime Drones 
aren&#39;t as &quot;well-bred&quot; as the Prime Drones culled from the original 
Assassin. I--&quot; it turns, and is met with a sight that causes it to 
pause.

Fight pulls her arm back, eyes burning with rage, before she lashes out 
shattering the arm and snapping it loose from the Drone unit. She then 
spins about and proceeds to decapitate another Drone unit with one 
kick. Her fists shatter steel and armor, cloned flesh and metal bone. 
Her kicks rip and shatter. Her body moving swiftly yet in a terrible 
rage. Each move is light and fluidic, but filled with power which 
matches the anger boiling in the Clow girl. As the last of the drones 
fall to the wayside, Decauter examines it&#39;s options and decides retreat 
is better than cybernetic oblivion. It falls back, and escapes amidst 
the chaos.

Fight, on her knees, pummels her fists into another dead Drone unit, 
screaming until at last Sakura and Makomi drag the distraught Clow girl 
off, restraining her.

It takes her five minutes to recover, and suppress her anger.

-----

Leaving the girls in capable hands, Makomi barely makes it to the meet.
Everyone is waiting for her at the Tower when she arrives, last to 
arrive in the huge dining room which dominates the 90th floor (beneath 
the command area above).

They were met by Captain Jack Lazarus, who was to represent the 
FreeWorld Alliance, whose officers manned and maintained the Tower&#39;s 
command and control centers. Next to him, on one side, the Raven 
Goddess stood with tool alteration kit at hand. On his opposite side 
stood a Judgment representing the Judgment Corps and the 
SpellThrashers.

&quot;Before we begin the meal, which I have been informed is the only 
reason some of you showed up --&quot; (all eyes turn towards Usagi and 
Haruka, who both glance off in no particular direction to avoid the 
glances) &quot;We need to modify your transformation tools to power them up. 
So if each of you would present your tools?&quot;

First was Rei, who handed her tool over to the Goddess. A minute later 
she was presented with -- &quot;A ring?&quot; she asked, holding the ring up. 
&quot;The tool is in &quot;rest&quot; now. When you need it just focus on the ring and 
command it through your will to change back into it&#39;s transformation 
form. Go on, give it a whirl.&quot;

Rei looked down, and focused. Seconds later the ring changed shape into 
a small power stick with the Mars emblem at it&#39;s top. &quot;That&#39;s it&#39;s true 
form. To transform simply yell &quot;Mars Dreaming Power, Make Up&quot;. And it&#39;s 
just that simple.&quot;

Next was Usagi, who gave her old tool forward rather reluctantly. In a 
minute she had a brand new transformation amulet that clipped onto her 
schoolgirl uniform rather nicely. &quot;Moon Dreaming Power, Make Up. And 
that&#39;s it.&quot;

After a minute of confusion, and a swap of tools (Ami &amp; Mako each were 
carrying the other&#39;s transformation pen) they were presented with their 
rings. &quot;Mercury Dreaming Power, Make Up. And Jupiter Dreaming Power, 
Make Up.&quot;

Minako, who was the most anxious to give up her tool, looked over the 
Goddess&#39; shoulder the whole time making comments on the design, shape 
and ring stone. Finally the Goddess turned her new ring over, though it 
seems the Goddess couldn&#39;t turn the ring over fast enough. &quot;Venus 
Dreaming Power, Make Up -- or do you want to change the words as well.&quot;
Minako, knowing she was just pushing her luck (at long last realizing 
this) simply shook her head and thanked the Goddess. That&#39;s when the 
meal started (and when Makomi entered, looking rather worn out.)

&quot;Hard time?&quot; Jack asked, to which she shook her head and sat down next 
to Ami. Jack nodded his head, and didn&#39;t push the subject anymore. 
Usagi, on the other hand, was curious. &quot;Isn&#39;t she going to have her 
tool redone like us?&quot;

&quot;Her tool is already at its peak efficiency. There&#39;s no more I can do 
for it since it&#39;s already perfect.&quot;

Usagi grunted, going back to eating. Minako looked miffed while the 
rest ate on silently.

Eventually the conversation turned to the situation at hand. 

From the center of a table a small holoprojector rose up, showing an 
image of Carnage. Jack Lazarus started the lecture, drawing everyone&#39;s 
attention to the image. &quot;This is, of course, the Assassin Guilder you 
fought yesterday. Carnage, of the Raptor Guild. Or, to be more precise, 
one of Carnage&#39;s Prime Drone Units.&quot; (silence as he regarded the image) 
&quot;From the remains we&#39;ve determined that this particular Prime Drone was 
reported destroyed sometime ago.&quot;

&quot;How did you find that out?&quot; Michiru asked, to which he replied &quot;It was 
reported to us by the Guilds. One of the agreements between the 
Alliance and the Guilds is that they keep us &quot;in the loop&quot; when one of 
their own (human or Prime Drone) is terminated. That way we keep count 
of the bodies, so to speak, and try to insure they are in fact dead and 
haven&#39;t gone to ground for some insidious reason -- like this Drone had 
apparently done so it seems.&quot; (silence) &quot;Who has been keeping an eye on 
the news as of late? Watching the slow increase in Assassin Guilder 
attacks on seemingly random non-target/innocents? What if I was to say 
that there is a pattern to the madness?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Rei said, intently listening while mildly chewing on her food.

&quot;All the attacks have been directed towards girls of 16-17 years of 
age, who all resemble these girls--&quot; (image flashes on screen) &quot;Clow 
Card females. The latest attack on her at the hospital only confirms 
our suspicions. They went straight for Fight, tried to capture her. 
Similar incidents were reported in a kidnapping attempt on a girl that 
resembled Umi (Water) and Dawn (Light).&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s strange, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Ami pointed it, attention focused, &quot;All 
these attacks on girls resembling Clow Card girls? Why? What&#39;s the 
connection?&quot;

The Judgment next to Jack hands him a batch of files as he speaks, &quot;If 
you were a SpellThrasher you&#39;d know the connection already.&quot; he then 
hands out the files speaking as he does. &quot;For awhile now the 
SpellThrashers have been on high alert, monitoring Clow Card females 
for sometime watching for anyone trying to &quot;recruit&quot; them.&quot;

&quot;Recruit them for what?&quot; (Haruka)

&quot;That should be obvious.&quot; Jack said, turning his gaze backwards out the 
window towards the skyline.

&quot;CLAMP School?&quot; (Makoto)

&quot;CLAMP School. Or, to be more precise, a &quot;insertion&quot; unit to infiltrate 
and possibly attack CLAMP School from within.&quot; (Jack)

&quot;So where do we go from here?&quot; (Makomi)

&quot;This means we have to find out who is trying to &quot;recruit&quot; these girls 
and why.&quot; Minako concluded, confident in her answer which drew a 
positive nod from Jack. &quot;She&#39;s right. Whatever is done next it has to 
be to uncover the architect behind this plot -- but who?&quot;

Usagi, eating away, nodded her head again, without stopping. Rei sighs 
as she watches, &quot;What do I ever see in you anyway--&quot;

The Judgment, Keiko, sighs as she focuses on her own food.

----

The Daidouji Residence

As Keiko walked through the door she notices Eve by the phone, looking 
tired.

&quot;Hard day?&quot; she asked, to which Eve shook her head, &quot;Tell me your day 
and I&#39;ll tell you mine.&quot;

&quot;I had to sit in on a meeting for the Sailor girls at their HQ. Dinner 
was good though, even brought you some (even re-heated nothing beats 
Mako-chan&#39;s cooking -- except maybe Fuu who makes a mean set of dishes 
when she&#39;s making waves in the kitchen).&quot;

&quot;My hero.&quot; she smiles, kissing Keiko on the cheek as she accepts 
dinner. &quot;I wish I could say my day was better, but I&#39;m afraid I just 
got talked into something that --&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

As the two walk upstairs to the kitchen, Eve elaborates. &quot;ChibiUsa 
called me.&quot;

&quot;Your &quot;goddaughter-in-law&quot; right? So how is Hotaru, anyway? You saw her 
today, right?&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Eve sighed. Yet another reason why she couldn&#39;t tell Keiko the 
truth. As far as Keiko knew &quot;Hotaru&quot; was her &quot;goddaughter&quot;, and not her 
true form -- she didn&#39;t like to lie to Keiko, but she didn&#39;t know what 
else to do. She had to explain her occasional disappearing acts, and 
why she hung around the apartment of Haruka/Michiru at times -- and, 
like Haruka, she didn&#39;t want Keiko to think it was an affair going on 
between the two.

&quot;So, what did Pinky want this time?&quot; Keiko asked, looking a little wary 
of what Eve was going to say next. &quot;She&#39;s going to an amusement park 
tomorrow with Hotaru and they wanted -- they wanted to take big Hotaru 
along. You know, my goddaughter.&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Eve fidgeted, &quot;Well I don&#39;t want the girls to go alone, but I 
have a SpellThrashers meeting I have to be at (work related to the 
CLAMP School incident) and I can&#39;t get away from it so I was wondering 
if--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d be glad to chaperone for the two Hotarus and Pinky.&quot; Keiko smiled, 
kissing Eve on the forehead. &quot;All you had to do was ask.&quot;
Eve blushed, head lowered, &quot;Thank you.&quot; she whispered meekly. &quot;No 
problem. What are loved ones for?&quot;

As she ate she blushed, still looking flustered all the way through 
dinner, right up to bedtime and past it.

In bed, as Keiko slept near her, she sighed. &quot;Why did I say that.&quot; she 
whispered, &quot;Why didn&#39;t I tell her the truth? Why--&quot;

----

Meanwhile

The Tower (Level 97-Command Level)

The huge circular command center, almost empty except for one person, 
hums quietly as AI systems monitor activity within and without of Tokyo 
city limits for any sign of Clow Card or Assassin Guilder activity. But 
for the person working late into the night, another task is set before 
them.

As Jack works on one of the terminals a familiar voice catches his 
attention. &quot;Working late I see.&quot;

He turns, and regards the visitor with a slight smile on his face. 
&quot;Michiru would be quite annoyed to know you like to sneak around in the 
dead on night for mysterious rendezvous with men.&quot;

&quot;What are you working on?&quot; Haruka asked, not minding his banter with 
her since she knew he wasn&#39;t at all serious about it. He turned and 
motioned towards the board, &quot;This used to be Infinity Bank in your 
Earth, but here it&#39;s the Trinity Bay Project. It&#39;s called that because 
of the three &quot;sectors&quot; of Tech-Noir construction on each corner 
(Tech-Noir being the term coined in relation to the construction and 
laying of artificial tech ground &quot;foundation&quot; for buildings which was 
perfected by the Winterians).&quot;

&quot;The three corners, clockwise, envelope the three &quot;Goddesses&quot; of 
Winterian folklore. The Goddess of Creation to the north, the Goddess 
of War to the West and the Goddess of the Heart to the East. Each 
&quot;sector&quot; bears the emblem of each goddess, with the center being the 
Winterian sign of the Trinity, the joining of the three goddesses as 
one.&quot;

As Haruka watches, Jack brings a closer view of the &quot;city&quot;. &quot;It&#39;s a 
self sustaining micro-city within a city, complete with office 
buildings, residential and shopping districts, a park and a school 
infrastructure. The center of the complex is the Trinity Sector, the 
center point of the three goddesses, their &quot;joining point&quot; as it were. 
This is where the Trinity Towers is, a set of four office buildings, 
one to each corner in conjunction to a sector, and a center one which 
encompasses the traits of all three. Here, let me draw a closer look at 
that sector, it&#39;s where we&#39;re going tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Haruka asked, watching the images as they narrowed and closed in 
on the center. &quot;That&#39;s where the Guild has its offices. Here--&quot; 
(points out the four buildings) &quot;The North Tower is real estate, 
construction, GalacticWeb site building, anything which concerns with 
&quot;creation&quot; of one type or another. The West Tower belongs to the 
FreeWorld Alliance and is the Alliance&#39;s equivalent of the Pentagon 
(one of a dozen &quot;Pentagon&quot; type command structures on Terra) which 
conforms to the Goddess of War. The East Tower deals with matters of 
the Heart in line with the Goddess of the East. The center is a mix of 
these. Here --&quot; (points at center building as it zooms in closer) &quot;--is 
a major Assassin Guild base of operations. Their central check-in point 
for incomings from off planet. This is where they&#39;re given assignments, 
and where we&#39;ll find Guild reps who&#39;ll explain why these Assassin Prime 
Droids are giving us so much grief.&quot;

Haruka stifles a yawn, and turns to leave. &quot;Rei&#39;s right, you really do 
talk too much.&quot;

&quot;Hmph.&quot; Jack mutters, waving her off (knowing full well that she&#39;s just 
joking with him), &quot;Go to bed before Michiru blames us for keeping you 
up past your bedtime -- again.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t want that.&quot; Haruka retorts, allowing the lift doors to close 
behind her.

As Jack looks over the holoimage of the central tower he can&#39;t help but 
think that there&#39;s more to this than meets the eye -- something more to 
this, but what?

-----

&quot;One down.&quot; Holocaust sighs, leaning back in his chair in the 
conference area, looking over the others who came to the meeting. &quot;We 
shouldn&#39;t be so hasty that it leads to premature termination without 
yielding any results.&quot; he remarks, turning his attention to Decauter. 

&quot;That is completely my fault that the attempt was a failure. I&#39;ll do 
better next time.&quot;

&quot;Wait.&quot; Holocaust whispers, deep in thought for a few seconds before 
raising his voice (and hand) &quot;Maybe we need to rethink our plan. We 
know who we need to keep occupied while we do our job, the Sailor 
Soldiers, the Judgments, and now this Trooper Mercury -- I&#39;m giving you 
all new assignments.&quot;

Everyone leans forward to listen as Holocaust lays out his plan. &quot;I 
want you to keep all opposing parties at bay, while the extraction 
teams switch from retrieval, to simple DNA collection. We&#39;ll let the 
cloners handle the rest once we require sufficient DNA to start making 
suitable &quot;copies&quot; for our use. Meanwhile there&#39;s still the matter of 
the 101.&quot;

As he turns towards the huge windows looking out over the dark 
oceanscape about them, he pulls his tesseract sphere out of his pocket. 
&quot;So far we have only 1 of the required 101 damned souls sent and 
recorded paid. We need 100 more impure souls of the damned to finish 
the payment in full, and gain what was promised us. To this end I want 
you all to be on the lookout for any beings that match this &quot;status&quot;. 
Even if it means departing from a pre-set mission it is vital that we 
gather the remaining 100 &quot;Credits&quot; and complete the payment as set 
forth in the covenant.&quot; (silence reigns for a few seconds as everyone 
in the room and monitoring from another part of the mobile fortress 
considers the possibilities) &quot;Keep the opposition occupied, but if the 
chance arises then terminate the damned. 100 more dead and we&#39;ll gain 
what we need to continue to survive in the world that is.&quot;

As the meeting breaks up, Holocaust turns to watch the sun rise, and 
Tokyo slowly begin to appear in the distance as the cloaked Fortress 
ship arrives at it&#39;s destination.

-----

And so, the Sailor Soldiers arrive at the Trinity Towers.

However, not all of them were there.

&quot;Makomi isn&#39;t here.&quot; Rei noted, taking a look about. &quot;I don&#39;t see 
anything out of the ordinary. The buildings have no strange auras or 
sense of power coming from them.&quot;

&quot;But they don&#39;t have the density of normal space either.&quot; Ami notes in 
turn, &quot;The one in the center is most out of place. It&#39;s distorted in a 
strange way somehow.&quot;

Makoto looks about, a curious expression on her face. &quot;The wind is too 
smooth. Flows too easily. Something&#39;s up.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because the entire complex is made to be aerodynamically sound 
from what I heard.&quot;

Everyone spins about and comes face to face with an armored male, no 
doubt an Assassin Guilder. &quot;The Winterians built these pre-fab tech 
cities with the ability to launch into the air in case the city came 
under attack. So this entire &quot;micro-city&quot; has good aerodynamics for 
atmospheric maneuvering if need be. Now--&quot; (motions to the building) 
&quot;We got the call this morning that you were coming, so if you would 
come with me? I&#39;ll--&quot; (stops, and turns back) &quot;This isn&#39;t a trap if 
that&#39;s what your concerned about. The 7th Judgment arranged this so I 
want to assure you it&#39;s all on the up and up. I even have this--&quot; 
(holds up datapad) &quot;--to confirm that she made the arrangements. We 
have nothing to hide, but if your uncertain of our motives I can call 
for our reps to come down here and explain the situation to you.&quot;
Left with little option, they agree to a face to face meeting outside.

-----

Eve/Hotaru didn&#39;t know what to do at first. Of all the stupid things 
she let it slip that morning about the investigation she heard about 
last night from Michiru-mama at the Trinity Towers. Keiko made a few 
calls, spoke to a few inside contacts in the Guilds, and before she 
knew it the Sailor Soldiers had a meeting set up with an important 
Guild rep. So, in the end, what was going to start out as a cleverly 
situated &quot;back-up&quot; unit lying in wait nearby at the amusement park near 
the Towers turned into an excuse for a day off.

Eve/Hotaru seemed as reluctant to ride the coasters as &quot;Little Hotaru&quot;, 
but with two energetic and hard to say no personalities as 
ChibiUsa/Keiko staring them in the face they had no option but to go.
ChibiUsa was having the time of her life. Little Hotaru seemed to 
scream a lot, but only because she was getting into the fun of coasters 
after a few rides.

Keiko smiled, but seemed to grip the restraints a little too hard 
during drops. She didn&#39;t like coasters that much despite her earlier 
bravado. As for Eve? She was having the time of her life, though only 
one thing could have made it better. &quot;I wish I could be me and not 
Hotaru.&quot; she lamented, resigning herself to being &quot;herself&quot; for the 
duration of the trip if only to keep up appearances for Little 
Hotaru/ChibiUsa.

As they took a break, Eve/Hotaru glanced over at Keiko and asked the 
obvious question, &quot;You don&#39;t like roller coasters very much, do you?&quot;
Keiko, drinking a bit of her drink, only shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m just not 
very good with tall vertical drops. Somehow I just think it&#39;s unnatural 
to drop a human at that rate of speed straight down at the ground. It 
makes me worry about all the things that could go wrong and I become my 
own worst enemy.&quot; (sighs) &quot;Sorry if I&#39;m a major wet blanket on your 
fun. You shouldn&#39;t have to hang around old women at your age.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind!&quot; Eve/Hotaru spat out, blushing at the way Keiko 
ridiculed herself, calling herself an &quot;old woman&quot;. &quot;I don&#39;t think your 
old at all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m over 400 years old.&quot; she remarked point blank, drawing another 
long pull of her drink, &quot;I don&#39;t think &quot;old&quot; could possibly be older 
than that.&quot;

&quot;Except maybe ChibiUsa.&quot; Eve/Hotaru joked. &quot;Oh, right, her. She&#39;s the 
youngest looking little old lady I ever saw in my life! It was probably 
a bitch for her to file for her old age benefits when she looked only 
9-11 eh?&quot; (Eve/Hotaru laughs) &quot;At least now she looks more like a 
mature woman, even if it&#39;s a look of 14-16 years, at least it&#39;s older.&quot; 
Keiko turns and smiles, &quot;I&#39;m glad I could spend the day with you, 
Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;Really? Me?&quot; she gasped, looking a bit fidgety. &quot;I bet you&#39;d rather be 
with your girlfriend than a scrawny young woman who--&quot; Keiko slowly 
puts her fingers under Hotaru&#39;s chin, raising her gaze to meet her own. 

&quot;Hotaru, there&#39;s something I need to ask--&quot;

One of Keiko&#39;s friends suddenly comes up to her, whispering in her ear. 
Her face darkened and she swears under her breath to herself. &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong?&quot; Eve/Hotaru asks, concerned. Keiko only sighs and stands up, 
&quot;Maybe you should wait here. ChibiUsa just left the park with Hotaru.&quot;
As Keiko turns to leave, Eve/Hotaru follows behind her. &quot;But why? Are 
they going to--&quot;

&quot;Your not asking me now if they&#39;re going to do the naughty in the 
middle of a public area miles from home are you?&quot;
Eve/Hotaru shook her head, though the thought did cross her mind 
briefly.

&quot;No. It looks like ChibiUsa lost a hat that your little sister gave her 
and she wants it back.&quot;

As they walked, eyes glancing back and forth, Eve/Hotaru sighed 
inwardly. &quot;That&#39;s right. Keiko thinks she&#39;s my little sister--&quot; (sighs 
bitterly) &quot;Why did this have to happen now? Keiko was so affectionate 
towards me -- I wish it could have lasted -- no, she&#39;s just being 
kind.&quot;

Suddenly she felt Keiko grasp her hand, squeezing it tightly, a bright 
warming smile across her face as she gave Eve/Hotaru a quick wink of 
reassurance. &quot;--?--&quot; Eve/Hotaru&#39;s mind blanked, her mind going a mile 
a minute. What was going on? Keiko suddenly became all warm and gentle, 
but why?

For the first time Eve&#39;s heart pounded, and her blood race at this sign 
of affection, but it was directed towards Hotaru and not &quot;herself&quot; as 
Eve! What was going on?? No, it couldn&#39;t be --

Was she falling in love all over again with Keiko, but as Hotaru? She 
couldn&#39;t feel or express her love for Keiko in this form--could she?
