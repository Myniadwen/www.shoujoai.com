<h1>Aqua and Emerald</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mioko.html">Mioko, Son of Ryoko</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The classroom is a dead silence. The sunlight beats in radiating the busy
faces. The sounds of one&#39;s and pencils as they scratch the paper. The odd
sigh of stress, the subtle moans and groans. A single other sounds breaks
this otherwise harmonious rhythm. The sounds as the pencil hits the table.
Placed down daintily. The aqua haired girl sorts out the many sheets of
paper as she puts them together, writing her name on each piece. In an
elegant script. &#147;Mizuno Ami&#148;. As she finally her body having finished, her
mind is not at such peace. As she sits there she can feel the harsh stares
piercing through her, icy daggers jabbing into her mind.It certainly isn&#146;t
easy at the top, especially when those who you stand above despise you for
it.

It isn&#146;t but a matter of days until posted on the dreaded board is the
great table of results. The crowds gather to look up their results. As
comes no surprise The names beside that number one spot, Mizuno Ami stands
in total dominance. Unlike the figure of numbers, the figure of the body
stands slouched, her delicate aquamarine eyes stare aimlessly at the
floor. Her friends stand about her in total glee. Two golden haired angels
dance about her, giggles of child like glee seep from their lips.
&#147;Ami-chan, you did so well&#148; The pigtailed bunny smiles, her blue eyes
glitter sparkling at her friend. Beside her the long haired goddess of
love nod in agreement. &#147;But I wish we could have done better&#148; Ami looks
meek suddenly. &#147;Its my fault you didn&#146;t do well&#148; She says in an almost
whisper. &#147;I&#146;m sorry&#148; Usagi and Minako look at her in concern they could
see something was seething inside the girl. Ami sighed looking at her two
friends, her soft lips parted the most gentle of sighs. &#147;I think i&#146;ll
go..&#148; she slowly walks away, she needed time to herself. Her eyes never
left the ground as she left slowly out the sunlit door. The light made it
almost look as if she were slowly marching to her death. Behind the two
golden haired girls stood the silent figure, tall and well built standing
over the two, like a giant. Her emerald eyes glistened with worry, she was
silent. Like a mother worrying about a tender child.

Outside the school the sun beat down on her soft face. Her eyes still
gazing at the concrete as it moved along her feet, her slender black
shadow unseen, but suddenly she saw several black shadows in front of her.
Slowly her aqua eyes raised up. She saw them, her classmates. Each one
glaring at her with the same sharp glares she felt during her exam. The
group moved, and Ami meekly stepped back. The forward push seemed to make
her move back. To the side of the large building, away from the prying eye
of the others.

Ami then felt the burning lash on her cheek, the cracking sound shattering
around her. The seething burn dug into her cheek, the force knocking her
to the ground. She looked up at the deliverer of the blow. She stood tall,
almost as tall as Makoto.Her dark face tanned brown. Long locks of hair
fell past her back, red like blood. Her brown eyes matching her skin were
sharp and narrow burning with the wicked fire of hatred. Amis face was an
aura of misery her watery eyes looked to hers, she winced feeling the
dagger like stare jab into her. &#147;Ko...konoko&#148; The girl spoke, her viper
like tongue jabbed into every part of her body. &#147;You have no right to so
much as speak my name you arrogant bitch&#148; Her voice boomed in her ears.
Ami looked to her trying to stand up. Konokos fingers grabbed her head,
her nails dug into her brutally forcing her to the ground. Amis school
case burst open, paper fluttered out. &#147;We&#146;re sick of you looking down on
everyone, just because you are some brainiac.. looking down on everyone,
you&#146;re nothing but a freak&#148; Ami couldn&#146;t take it, she merely curled up
helplessly, gazing at the blades of grass which gently fluttered. Every
word hitting in on her. &#147;You&#146;re totally pathetic.. you think you can
defeat us just by beating us at some lousy tests, you&#146;re nothing but a
nerd&#148; Konoko grinned she knew she was getting the better of Ami. She
grabbed Ami brutally by the hair jogging her up to her feet, only to
viciously give a burning slap throwing the defenseless girl to the ground.
&#147;As for your dad, knowing him, he&#146;s probably off sleeping with another
Woman&#148; Those words struck Ami straight at her heart. the tears formed
again, slowly dropping in the grass. &#147;Unwanted by both your friends and
parents, you mother probably only stays with you in pity&#148; Konoko turned
around, only to see the large form shadowed by the sun. Stepping forward
Makoto&#146;s emerald eyes dug into Konokos, a burning was shining brightly in
those emerald diamonds of eyes. Her strong hands clenched together into a
tight fist. &#147;You leave her alone you coward... how dare you.. how dare you
take your own shortcomings and jealousy&#146;s out on an innocent girl&#148; her
voice was dark, speaking the most pure, bitter, spiteful hate Konokos ears
had ever heard. Makotos voice continued, her voice was holding back,
holding back the urge to step forward and literally kill her. Konoko lead
everyone away. Her voice said, passing away. &#147;You dirty adonis, slutty
dyke.. you&#146;re nothing but a brute&#148; Makotos eyes snapped open. Ami raised
her head, feeling the deep hurt Makoto felt from that comment. Makotos
face was red wit fury, but she was holding it back. She turned around and
screamed out. &#147;YOU BITCH! YOU TOUCH HER AGAIN AND I SWEAR I WILL FUCKING
NOT HOLD BACK KILLING YOU!&#148; Her voice was weaved with the deepest lust for
blood. Makoto turned around kneeling down to Ami, like a mother she took
Amis shoulders softly, taking her loving finger and wiping away one of
Amis tears. &#147;Its alright Ami, they&#146;re gone now.. they&#146;re gone&#148; Ami looked
at Makoto silently, her mind was filled with so many thoughts she couldn&#146;t
keep up with them. Makoto turned around picking up the scattered paper,
sorting them and putting them in the bag. She handed Ami the bag smiling
gently. &#147;C&#146;mon, i&#146;ll walk you home&#148; Ami opened her mouth, her voice edgy,
her mind had been scattered from the hurt and shock of the conflict.
&#147;Th..thank you&#148;.

Ami came out of the shower. She gazed upon the misty mirror looking at
herself. &#147;Nakedness was the time when the body is at its most pure form,
yet society deems it a sin.. does that mean that purity itself is a sin&#148;
She sighs as she says this, her thoughts drifting off. &#147;Why... why do they
hate me, I know why, I look down on them. My greatest gift is my greatest
curse. Whatever I do, I hurt people in some way or another.I gaze at
myself, seeing only a curse. Is that what I really am?&#148; She looks at
herself again. &#147;But despite this I rarely let people inside of me. But
Makoto? Why is it whenever she opens her heart I open mine in kind. Why
did she come an help me?&#148; Tears begin running down her eyes. She picks up
a glass of perfume and forces it at the mirror, not throwing it, but
hitting it. Both pieces of glass shatter instantly. Shards flying
everywhere. Holding herself she slowly slumps to her knees. Tears running
with the blood in her hands. &#147;I hate you.. I hate you... I HATE THAT IMAGE
IN THE MIRROR!&#148;

The next day the girls sat in the Crown fruit parlour. The usual bright
discussions were going on. Ami painted a face on her smiling, but she
seemed more out of it than usual. The girls asked about the bandage around
her hand. She told the half truth saying some glass broke. They were happy
with just that. Makoto was passing gazes to her. Suddenly Makoto smiled.
&#147;Me and Ami will go get some drinks, my treat&#148; Ami blinked as Makoto urged
her up. Ami putting up little resistance eventually followed Makoto over
to the bar. Makoto turned to Ami. &#147;Ami, I know something is going on.
Lately you seem so drawn in on yourself. I know you&#146;re a natural
introvert, but there is something more here. I&#146;m worried about you&#148; Ami
looks down and then to Makoto. &#147;Mako-chan, its nothing, really. Don&#146;t
worry about me&#148; Makoto gives her a fake smile. &#147;I&#146;m your friend, I was
born to worry about you&#148; Ami gave a small giggle at the crack. As Makoto
picked up the drink tray giving a couple to Ami to carry they returned to
the table.

&#147;How does this look&#148; Rei showed off the crimson dress, falling down to her
feet, which tightly fit her form. Minako admired it, as did Usagi. &#147;That
looks wonderful Rei-chan, how much is it&#148; Rei looked at the price tag.
&#147;12,000 yen&#148; Usagi blinked. &#147;Oh I can&#146;t afford that..&#148; Rei grinned. &#147;Yeah
with all the sweets you eat, it drains your wallet, and that pudgy from of
yours wouldn&#146;t fit anyway&#148; Ami sighed as the war kept on going, the
screaming filling the clothing shop.. Ami didn&#146;t feel like shopping for
cloths. No matter what she war, in her mind, she was repulsive. Minako
popped out. She was wearing a strapless small dress, going down to her
knees. The green and blue was separated by a diagonal line separating the
two colours. Minako danced on her toe doing a small twirl. Re smiled.
&#147;Aqua and Emerald go so well together&#148; Ami almost choked. Her cheek
suddenly flushed a bright glow of red. She looked over, Makoto was sitting
alone trying on shoes. She was too big for most of the dresses in this
shop. Ami slowly makes her way over to her. Taking a seat beside her.
Makoto looked to Ami, as Ami swallowed, breaking the silence. &#147;You have
nice feet Mako-chan&#148; Makoto gave a soft blush, barely noticeable. &#147;Thanks
Ami, but yours are nicer&#148; Ami didn&#146;t hold back her red. Makoto reached up
taking a pair of sapphire blue high heels. &#147;Try these on&#148; Ami smiled,
obediently like a dog she had her shoes off. Slipping on the heels. &#147;Anno,
Mako-chan how did you know my size&#148; Makoto smiled. &#147;A mother knows these
things&#148; Ami softly laughed at the comment.&#148;Ami, tonight..&#148; Ami looked up
&#147;Nani?&#148; Makoto smiled continuing. &#147;Ami, i&#146;m genuinely worried about you at
the moment. And if it helps, tonight how about I cook you dinner, for jus
the two of us&#148; Ami beamed at Makoto. &#147;Thank you, Mako-chan, that will be
lovely&#148; Makoto returned the expression. &#147;How about tonight at six&#148; Ami
nodded &#147;Okay, tonight at six&#148;

Makoto and Ami were sitting at the small circular table packed to the brim
with Makotos delights, they ate slowly, silently enjoying the food. The
pleasant welcoming silence was broken by Amis soft sweet voice.

&#147;Mako-chan.. thank you, for all this&#148; Makoto looks up. &#147;Hmm.. oh its okay
Ami&#148; Ami looked at her. &#147;No, I mean, my mother.. shes always so busy, so I
have to live off a diet of microwaved ramen and sandwiches. I&#146;ve only ever
got to taste a proper home cooked meal made with love, from anyone but
you.&#148; Makoto looks to Ami. &#147;Well, Its really lonely isn&#146;t it. Sitting at
an empty table, the only sound being the ambience of outside. The clinging
of utensils. I find it nice just having somebody by my side to talk to. I
hate the loneliness&#148; Ami only nodded. &#147;But sometimes I wonder if was ever
meant to be alone? I mean yesterday, those people hated me for merely
existing. I know i&#146;ve hurt them by just being there.. by just being me by
just..&#148; Ami suddenly burst out in tears. Knocking herself forward she
buried he face in Makotos shoulders weeping. Makoto put her arms gently
around her, her fingers running through the aqua hair. &#147;Its okay.. Ami..
its okay, i&#146;m here for you&#148;

Ami was lying in her bed. Her eyes still tear stained, she looked up at
the roof, the light shining up on her face.&#148;Makoto, shes such a good
friend to me. Shes always so welcoming, always wanting to listen to me.
Shes so motherly and caring. Always willing to share feelings, everything
i feel. When i&#146;m hurt shes never failed in making me feel better.I look in
those beautiful emerald eyes, her soft face, beaming with affection.&#148; She
blinks giving a soft gasp. &#147;I can&#146;t belive it.. no.. she.. I... I love
her.. I care for her, I love her, more than anyone.. anything..&#148; Tears
returned to her eyes. &#147;I&#146;m not good enough for her, I hate that image in
the mirror. I&#146;m nothing but ab burden to her.. Makoto, i&#146;m so sorry.. i&#146;m
sorry for loving you&#148; Her eyes are streaming with tear. She cried until
she slept. A night of tears.

The next day Ami made her way to school. She was late, she had spent all
morning trying to motivate herself to go to school. She couldn&#146;t face
Makoto. She slowly made her way to school. She saw standing at a tree
Makoto and Usagi. Her heart began beating faster, slowly she made her way
close,remaining out of sight. She could finally hear their voices.

&#147;Mako-chan.. i&#146;m worried about Ami-chan. She seems so restricted lately,
as if something is eating away at her&#148; Makoto smiled to her friend. &#147;No,
shes okay, i&#146;m sure shes just having exam stress, even the smartest of
girls worry&#148; Usagi looked at her friend nodding. &#147;I guess so, I hope shes
alright&#148; Makoto hid her waning worries. &#147;She&#146;ll be fine..&#148; Amis heart was
racing, her whole face was red from blush. &#147;I can&#146;t believe it, shes
protecting me. I..i... I made her lie.. my own worries and problems made
her lie to one of her best friends..&#148; She sighed as she shamefully made
her way to class.

After the longest class in her life Ami left the school. Her mind was
constantly clouded with thoughts. Her mind rushed with thoughts of Makoto.
&#147;I owe her, thats all there is to it, but.. how.. how can I repay her&#148; A
small smile formed on her face, the first genuine smile she gave in a long
time.

The doorbell rang as Ami opened the door to her apartment. Makoto blinked
twice. &#147;Hi Ami, ummm why did you call me here&#148; Ami blushed lightly as she
sat Makoto down. &#147;Well I wanted to return the favour you did last night&#148;
Makoto tilted her head with a small smile. Amis knees were shaking, Makoto
could see she was more nervous and edgy than ever. She also remembered
today how she noticed Ami had not looked her in the eye, not once. She
looked to her. &#147;Ami..&#148; Her friend looked to her. &#147;Its funny Makoto.. I
haven&#146;t been so nervous in my whole life&#148; Makoto smiled laughing. &#147;Why its
only dinner.. A bad meal can&#146;t kill you, like Minakos nursing&#148; They both
laughed together. Amis cheeks were a bright crimson. &#147;Mako-chan.... I.. I
actually called you because&#148; She looked down at the ground. &#147;I know i&#146;m
just going to make our relationship worse.. I mean.. somebody like me
being only a burden for you.. Well... Mako.. I.. I love you.. I love you
more than anybody i&#146;ve seen or known in my whole life&#148; Makoto took these
words hard, it hit her like a sledgehammer in the head. &#147;Ami..&#148; Ami
interrupted. &#147;Makoto.. i&#146;m so sorry,I drag you here to cook you a half ass
dinner, and end up destroying our friendship forever, causing you even
more pain. Making you lie to more people like I made you do to Usagi&#148;
Makoto was in shock, she heard her say that. Ami was now crying again.
Makoto picked her up whispering softly in her ear like a sweet voice.
&#147;Ami... I love you too.. its so nice that I can make you feel better, when
in your darkest hour, i&#146;m always there to show you the way&#148; Slowly as if
by instinct their lips met in a warm embrace. For what seemed like years
they broke it. &#147;Mako-chan, what Usagi said was right&#148; Makoto blinked
&#147;Nani?&#148; Ami smiled laughing. Aqua and Emerald really do go well together&#148;
