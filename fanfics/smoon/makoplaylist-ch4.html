<h1>Makoto's Playlist (part 4 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chakeroo.html">chakeroo</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makoplaylist-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><p class="p1"><i>Ok will it be a steak and potatoes or maybe she’d like pasta… wait… The 
wine! The wine is very important! And flowers! Definitely flowers! </i>Makoto was listing 
things that she would need for her and Minako’s date in a couple of days.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was visiting her father’s friend for a while now that friend handled her 
trust fund when she was young. She needed to do some papers so that she was the only one 
managing her trust fund and for the financing of the café she wants to open. She stayed 
also for a couple of days every week to try different foods so that she would get an idea 
for the menu of the café. She was walking at the streets and she saw this flower shop which 
was selling different kinds of roses. She went inside and looked around. She stopped as she 
saw these apple green colored roses on the table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Beautiful isn’t it?” asked the florist.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Definitely. What is it called? I never seen a green rose before.” Makoto 
replied still looking at the plant. <i>These would be perfect. I know she’ll love it and 
it’s in my favorite color too!</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Viridiflora or Rosa Chinensis. It’s one of the rarest roses in the world and 
luckily, I got to cultivate a few of those. So if you’re planning to buy those… would be 
expensive. <i>Really expensive.</i>” Said the florist.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll take it. All of it. Just give me the numbers and I’ll pay you.” Said 
Makoto without even glancing at the florist.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you sure?” the florist couldn’t believe what Makoto was saying.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Definitely.” Replied Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto then thanked the florist after the latter gave her tips how to 
preserve the rose and take care of the plant. She had convinced the florist to give her a 
fresh branch to cultivate it. A song playing from her iPod made her think of Minako 
again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p6">You don't have a clue<br>
What it is like to be next to you<br>
I'm here to tell you<br>
That it is good<br>
That it is true<br>
<br>
Birds singing a song<br>
Old paint is peeling<br>
This is that fresh<br>
That fresh feeling<br>
<br>
Words can't be that strong<br>
My heart is reeling<br>
This is that fresh<br>
That fresh feeling<br>
<br>
Try<br>
Try to forget what's in the past<br>
Tomorrow is here<br>
Love,<br>
Orange sky above lighting your way<br>
There's nothing to fear<br>
<br>
Birds singing a song<br>
Old paint is peeling<br>
This is that fresh<br>
That fresh feeling<br>
<br>
Words can't be that strong<br>
My heart is reeling<br>
This is that fresh<br>
That fresh feeling<br>
<br>
Some people are good<br>
Babe in the 'hood<br>
So pure and so free<br>
I'd make a safe bet<br>
You're gonna get whatever you need</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Makoto happily walked towards her hotel while singing the song and 
remembering Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">………</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Ring Ring Ring….</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako rushed over to the telephone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Moshi moshi. Aino residence.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Minachan! How are you?” Mrs. Aino shouted at the other end of the phone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mom! You didn’t have to shout.” Minako answered as she pulled her ears away 
from the phone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So. what’s the news there love? Are doing ok?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m doing fine mom. So how’s dad and England?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He’s ok. He’s really busy these days. Anyway, we go around on the weekends. 
We’re even planning just to stay at home on Valentine’s. You’re dad said he’ll cook 
something special but I bet we’ll end up ordering take out. Hahaha…. So do you have a date 
tomorrow? How’s Makochan? Does she have a date too?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“…” Minako was blushing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Minachan?” asked her mom in worried tone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well… Makochan asked me out so…”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Makochan?!? Wow! That’s good!” Mrs. Aino was shouting again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>She’s ok with that?!?</i> Thought Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She’s a really nice girl Minachan. She protects you and everything. And the 
way she looks at you…”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The way she looks at me?” Minako was surprised.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh. You haven’t figured it out yet? How about what your feeling? You figured 
it out?” asked Mrs. Aino. Minako heard her giggling in the other end of the phone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But before Minako could answer, “I have to go dear, your dad is calling on my 
cell. Message you later. Bye love. Kisses.” Her mom continued and then put down the 
phone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako was still holding phone, confused.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">………</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The day came and Makoto was nervous. She checked and rechecked everything. To 
the sauce, flower arrangements, her breath and the suit she’s wearing. She told Minako to 
meet her at her apartment later that evening.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She planned that it is more romantic to cook for Minako than to eat out with 
hundreds of people lining for the very best restaurants in town. Some of the petals of the 
roses were scattered at the dining table and living room. She dimmed the lights a bit and 
scanned the apartment again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then the doorbell rang.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Ok. Do not panic Makoto. DO NOT PANIC. Remember what Haruka said, just 
breathe…</i> She checked her breath and suit at the mirror near the door and opened the 
door.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto’s jaw dropped to the floor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako was wearing a simple yet elegant strapless shiny black dress showing 
her beautiful neckline, a pearl necklace and earrings and the hem of the skirt is just 
above her knee. Her hair was made into a knot from behind. She was wearing stilettos which 
made her just 2 inches smaller than Makoto. She almost looked like Holly Golightly but 
blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Damn! She’s perfect.</i> Makoto thought.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Makochan, are you going to let me in or will you just stare all night?” 
giggled Minako. She was pleased that Makoto loved her dress. She went through a couple 
before deciding that this was the one she will be wearing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh right. Sorry.” Makoto said giving herself a mental slap. “Umm… I kind of 
planned not to eat out. I cooked something for you and maybe later…” she trailed off 
blushing as she let Minako in.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That’s perfect Makochan. I didn’t know you looked good in a suit. I’m glad 
you cooked.” Smiled Minako and touches Makoto’s tie. Makoto blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>She looks so handsome and dreamy in that suit. She’s so tall, thank Kami I 
wore this stilettos tonight.</i> Minako giggled to herself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As Makoto lead Minako unto the kitchen. The blonde was in awe of what she 
saw.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Candle lit dinner and roses all over the place! This is so romantic. The 
smell of the food is heavenly. Oh my… Makochan’s perfect. My Makochan. </i>Minako thought 
dreamily.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto pulled the chair a for Minako to let her seat and the brunette served 
dinner after that.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The dinner was almost perfect except for the part that Makoto was so nervous 
she spilled some wine on herself and the apartment almost went in flames as Minako knocked 
over the candles as she tried to wipe the wine out of Makoto’s shirt. Some of the towels 
caught on fire and almost reached the spilled wine. They panicked and tried to stop the 
fire by throwing the vase water unto the fire. Luckily it worked.<span 
class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After several minutes they finally calmed down and 
finished their dinner at the couch in Makoto’s living room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The dinner was amazing well except for…” Minako laughed before finishing her 
sentence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah that.” Smiled Makoto. “Could you wait there for a while? Ill just get 
something.” Asked Makoto. Minako nodded.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She stood up and went to her room. After a few seconds she came out and her 
left hand was behind her back clutching a dozen roses she bought the other day. She then 
turned on the stereo, eyed the remote and walked over to Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mina tenshii will you do me the honor of dancing with you?” asked the 
brunette as her right hand motioned towards the blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course Makochan.” She blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Before she hit the play button on the remote, she handed the roses to Minako 
and whispered, “Happy Valentine’s Day my tenshii.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako hugged Makoto after<span class="Apple-converted-space">  
</span>putting the roses at the table and then positioned her arms on the chest of Makoto 
and the brunette cautiously hugged the blonde and pushed the play button.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As the music started, they began to slow dance…</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Come a little closer flicker in flight<br>
we have about an inch space but I'm here<br>
I can breathe in what you breathe out<br>
<br>
<span class="s1">As the chorus neared, Makoto hugged Minako tightly and began to sing to 
blonde.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><br>
Let me know if I'm doing this right<br>
Let me know if my grips too tight<br>
Let me know if I can stay all of my life<br>
Let me know if dreams can come true<br>
Let me know if this one's yours too<br>
Coz I see it (Oh...) <br>
And I feel it right here<br>
And I feel you right here</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p9">Makoto’s heart was racing and she knew Minako could feel it.</p>
<p class="p9"><i>She’s singing for me! And she’s so warm. This is like the sweetest thing 
anyone has ever done for me. First date ever with someone who’s not expecting me to give up 
something. </i>Minako thought.<span class="s2"><br>
<br>
The vacuous night steps aside<br>
to give meaning to Gemini's dreaming<br>
The moon on its back and the seemingly<br>
Veiled rooms lit by the same star</span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Minako felt like she’s melting inside Makoto’s arms. She can 
hear Makoto’s heart racing as the brunette held her closer. She felt protected and most of 
all, loved. She was a little bit confused but she felt happy and contented. </span><br>
<br>
Let me know if I'm doing this right<br>
Let me know if my grips too tight<br>
Let me know if I can stay all of my life<br>
Let me know if dreams can come true<br>
Let me know if this one's yours too<br>
Coz I see it (Oh...)<br>
And I feel it right here<br>
And I feel you right here<br>
</p>
<p class="p10">Minako was staring at Makoto’s eyes and the brunette looked back lovingly. 
Makoto gave it all to fight the feeling of kissing Minako on the lips and opt to kiss the 
blonde’s forehead instead. Minako’s face went crimson red and Makoto chuckled.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>I could get used to this.</i> They both thought.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After dancing, they talked and talked until 4 in the morning. They were 
still holding each other. Feeling sleepy Makoto said that she would take the couch and 
Minako could sleep in her bed. But Minako insisted that they should sleep together.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><i>Kami please give me the strength not to kiss her or do anything stupid 
while she’s sleeping. </i>Makoto thought.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p9">As though Minako could read the brunette’s mind, she said, “Don’t worry I 
won’t rape you or anything.” And then she laughed.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Makoto blushed and Minako lead her to the brunette’s bedroom.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Makoto gave some old shirt and shorts for Minako to change from her dress 
and she changed clothes as well. A few minutes after lying down, Minako was fast asleep 
facing the brunette and was hugging her loosely. Makoto couldn’t help but fall in 
admiration with the blonde’s face as she slept. She brushed some of Minako’s hair at her 
forehead and sang to her in a whisper.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p13">…Maybe I know, somewhere<br>
Deep in my soul<br>
That love never lasts<br>
And we've got to find other ways<br>
To make it alone<br>
Keep a straight face<br>
<br>
And I've always lived like this<br>
Keeping a comfortable, distance<br>
And up until now<br>
I had sworn to myself that I'm<br>
Content with loneliness<br>
<br>
Because none of it was ever worth the risk<br>
<br>
Well, You, are, the only exception<br>
You, are, the only exception<br>
You, are, the only exception<br>
You, are, the only exception<br>
<br>
I've got a tight grip on reality<br>
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here<br>
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up<br>
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream…</p>
<p class="p14"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“My Makochan… my teady bear…” Minako said in her sleep and she smiled and 
hugged Makoto more.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Makoto panicked for a few seconds because she thought Minako was awake and 
then she relaxed after hearing what the blonde had said.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Teady bear. I can be your teady bear. Definitely.</i> Thought Makoto and 
she finally slept.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">……….</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Makoto woke up as someone was humming a song from the shower. She sleepily 
turned to other side as Minako went out of the bathroom and was still singing…</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p13">You, are, the only exception<br>
You, are, the only exception<br>
You, are, the only exception</p>
<p class="p14"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Makoto laid there frozen and was fully awake now. She gripped the pillow 
hard as her heart started beating faster and faster and she thought she was having a heart 
attack.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Oh Kami… Oh Kami… was she awake when I sang to her? I know she was 
definitely sleeping last night. Think Makoto! Think of an excuse! Shit…. Shit… shit…</i> 
Makoto thought panicking.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">”Good afternoon sleepy head!” Minako said.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Makoto shut her eyes and braced for the worst.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I can’t understand why that song got stuck to my head. I’ve been singing it 
since I woke up. A great song but kind of sad in way.” Minako continued as she was picking 
up her clothes from the desk chair.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Makoto let out a sigh. <i>That was a close one.</i> She thought. She then 
turned around and saw the blonde just wearing a towel that was too small to cover most of 
her body.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Makoto suddenly put her hands to her nose and gasped. She felt blood oozing 
from her nose. She hurriedly walked backwards towards the bathroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><br>
</span><i>Shit! Why in hell would she be wearing that? Is she doing this on purpose?!?<span 
class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gave her a freaking towel last night. A big towel! 
She’s soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sexy. This is torture… Ok stop 
imagining things, your nose is bleeding! Torture I terll you! Torture! </i>The brunette 
thought as she waved her fist in the air and then she tried to find something to cover her 
nose. She couldn’t see much because she was holding her nose and head up. Suddenly a towel 
was put in her face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You’re bleeding Makochan!” Minako said as she was holding the towel from 
Makoto’s nose.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto looked at Minako and saw the blonde was now wearing only her bra and 
panties. More blood came down from her nose. <i>Why wouldn’t she just dress up already! 
I’ll lose a lot of blood if she won’t change! </i>Makoto thought while panicking. “I’m fine 
Minachan… just go and get dressed first. I’ll handle this.” The brunette said reassuringly. 
The blonde finally gave up and walked out of the bathroom. <i>Breathe Makoto. Breathe. Do 
not panic.</i> Makoto said to herself and began calming down.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>That was weird.</i> Minako thought and then she looked at herself at the 
mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i> Oh that’s why. But I know she 
already seen me in my underwear before. Oh well… My teady bear is really funny.</i> Minako 
giggled while getting dressed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After controlling her nose bleed and washed herself, Makoto went out of the 
bathroom and searched for Minako. She found her washing the dishes from the night before 
and was now fully dressed. She smiled as she hears her singing the song again.</p>
