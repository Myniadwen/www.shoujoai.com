<pre>

When did I fall in love with you?  I wonder that sometimes,
when I lie here, next to you, you know.  You&#39;re sleeping, as
peacefully as you could ever sleep, while I lie here, gazing
upon this person who made me whole after being nothing more
than a fragment for years.

You saved my soul...

Your hair is down now, free from those absurd buns that only
you can seem to manage to pull off.  Maybe it&#39;s the way you
are, people are too busy seeing the outgoing superstar you
are to care about how you look.

Impossible eyes, closed now.

Impossible hair, free and flowing.

Gods you&#39;re beautiful, my Usako.

I could just lay here forever with you in my arms and never,
never want to let go...  Now I&#39;m crying.. I can&#39;t let you hear
that, because then you&#39;ll be sad too.  I want to be selfish
in my own little pains.

The parents I never knew.

Always being apart.

I love you, my Usako...

                       *    *    *    *

Haruf?  Oh.. it&#39;s morning....

I hate mornings...

Oh?  Hello there...

That pouty look on your sleeping face looks so funny.  You
almost look like a little child who&#39;s had their ball taken
away, and you&#39;re not sure if you want to be upset about it
or not quite yet.

That wonderful, raven-black hair I so wish I had.

You look so refined and mature, even in your sleep, while
I seem to stay like a little girl.  I know my body&#39;s
grown.. but I feel so young...  I can&#39;t explain it...
It&#39;s..?

Oh why bother worrying about it?

My morning feels better already with you there, sleeping
peacefully at my side.

The face is from deep in my memory, a time long ago.  I
once saw that face twisted in rage, but now it&#39;s so hard
to see you in that light.

You are not that monster.

A stirring...

&quot;Good morning, Hotachan....&quot;

You look at me with that funny, &#39;How&#39;d you wake up first?&#39;
look I know so well.  Ah, it&#39;s gone now.

&quot;Good morning, Usako....&quot;

Heh.. you have morning breath..... but I do to, so I guess
we&#39;re even.

Time to cast aside sleep and go about with our day.. and
tonight I guess we&#39;ll meet here again.  Me, watching you,
watching me...

I wonder who&#39;ll fall asleep first tonight?
