<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Awkward Space<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>For  all its upscale furnishings and expensive appeal, the orderly hotel  room was suffocating in its neutral colors and blandness. Outside the  wrap around windows, the setting sun shone on the skyline of a foreign  city; neon lights blinked into existence, apartment lights turned on,  and in the distance, an impressive clock face glowed the time. Big Ben?  This was Britain she was seeing?</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Slowly, the other end of  the unremarkable room came into focus. A petite, dark haired woman  trudged through the door, dropped her oversize purse in the hallway,  and stumbled into the bedroom where she promptly collapsed on the bed.  A small, white plushie cat hopped up alongside her, but her attention  was glued to a framed photo on the nightstand, the only personal touch  in the almost sterile room. Eyeing the picture critically, the young  woman finally picked it up, as if drawing it closer to herself would  bring her closer to the emotions captured within it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  just like that, Rei’s view shifted. No longer watching from afar, it  was suddenly as though she were lying right next to the object of her  vision, and when she looked down for a better glimpse of the photo, she  was shocked to see a well remembered image of herself and Minako, side  by side at the beach wearing matching bikinis and matching grins. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Which is when she looked back at the white cat and finally recognized Artemis.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Which is when she slowly turned her head, knowing who she’d see, but almost afraid to see it…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Aino  Minako lay next to her. And having made that recognition, a sudden wave  of foreign emotions flooded Rei’s consciousness; exhaustion,  frustration, excitement, but mostly, what she felt from the other girl  was longing. And above all, one concrete thought slammed into Rei’s  mind: </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Tomorrow. I’ll get to see her again tomorrow.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  carefully set her brush down on the simple, wooden dresser of her old  room at the Hikawa Shrine. Staring blankly at her reflection, her mind  replayed the vision she had experienced the night before; a vision  brought to her unbidden by the mere flame of a candle at the most  unopportune time during dinner with Usagi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had always had a  talent for seeing things, premonitions, in the fire before, but such  images had always come to her in vague and abstract shapes and  feelings, never so clearly defined, never so fully detailed, never had  she been able to pinpoint someone she knew on demand and… and  understand what they were thinking! The newfound ability somewhat  frightened her, and although she had to admit that she longed to try it  again, she didn’t know if it was because she wanted to test her new  found skill, or simply because she wanted to see the image of Minako  once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Having not fallen asleep until the early hours of the  morning, Rei had spent most of the previous night in a frustrated state  of confusion. How had she gained this ability? Was it related to  remembering her past life? Had she regained a skill she had once used  during her life on the moon? And if so, what had triggered the vision  and what was its significance?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But what had shocked her the most  was that although she had felt the truth in her strange premonition,  she had still been caught off guard when Usagi had called her earlier  that morning to inform her of the party that night – a party to welcome  back Aino Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There were too many questions, too many  uncertainties; between the memories of her past life that still  trickled to her consciousness in bits and pieces, her strange new  ability to tap into there whereabouts and <em>what</em>abouts of her closest friend, and her yet jumbled feelings for said woman… and now she was forced with <em>facing</em> her?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well,  she’d have to face her mad, because Rei was rather upset at the singer,  who couldn’t so much as let her closest friend know she was coming back  for a visit. But then, that irritation would only make it easier to  face the object of her confusion, for that anger, that desire to avoid  Minako, was so much easier than dealing with the other warring feelings  she couldn’t seem to keep her mind off of.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And here she was, in  her old room at her old shrine, getting ready; perhaps a little  overdressed in a skirt that might have been a little too short and a  blouse that might have been a little too fitted for a respectable miko,  perhaps being a little too critical of the makeup she was applying ever  so carefully, perhaps fussing entirely too much when she wasn’t even  sure why she was doing it in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was, of  course, one upside to this distraction. At least she could put off  meeting with her shrine elders this day. But she also knew she couldn’t  put off the reason for her trip forever, for when it came down to it,  they were as aware of the purpose of her visit as she was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  paused behind a door that only she could see, a door that would lead  her to the senshi’s secret headquarters. It sounded silly, at the age  of nineteen, to still use such words, but that’s exactly what that room  had been; a secret base from which they’d planned to protect the world.  It seemed like a lifetime ago. Technically, since they’d all died, only  to be reborn thanks to Usagi and the power of the ginzuishou, it <em>had</em> been a lifetime ago. Minako smirked sardonically and wrapped her hand around the cool, metal doorknob.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she didn’t open the door. Slowly, her hand returned back to her side  distractedly. Even though they’d grown so close, she anticipated that  she and Rei would barely acknowledge each other at first; that default  need for rivalry was still so much a part of them. It had been five  months since they’d last seen each other. It felt like yesterday. It  felt like forever. She couldn’t distinguish the difference, it was too  confusing, but she supposed that went with the territory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  realized she was stalling, but it was that same self awareness that  made her begrudgingly understand that the anticipation of seeing Rei  always reduced her to a giddy school girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The pop star sucked in  a breath of air and stood straight. Such a simple thing shouldn’t  bother her. She was Aino Minako, international singing sensation. She’d  performed concerts in front of tens of thousands, been on countless  television interviews, all without blinking an eye. But here, one  woman; her closest friend, reduced her to a shy and nervous wreck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, she grit her teeth and stepped forward, and with a shaky hand, reached out to open the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kino Hana-ya.” Usagi sighed dreamily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. You are going to keep your last name, then.” Rei commented critically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Owning your own business at nineteen? You’re so amazing, Mako-chan.” Ami complimented kindly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  Rei holding a small, colorful piece of paper between them, Kino Makoto  blushed down at the advertisement that promoted her small flower shop  that had only just opened its doors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wai! Minako-chan!” It was Usagi’s excitable voice that caused her friends to first cringe, and second, catch her excitement.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Barely  waiting for the idol to finish descending the steps, the former  princess tackled her jetsetting friend, who, despite her time away from  the ball of energy that was Usagi, still managed to keep not only her  feet underneath her, but Usagi’s, too. A good sense of balance was a  prerequisite to befriending the excitable woman, but Minako had the  ability to do it all while maintaining her cool sense of grace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a flurry of motion and Minako was surrounded. Usagi clung to one  arm, Makoto was firing questions at her, and Ami was trying to get a  polite, yet insistent word in edgewise. Laughs and hugs abounded as  each woman got reacquainted with each other in a girlish barrage of  words, squeals and gestures that covered each others newest hairstyle,  the latest makeup and accessories, and of course, the freshest gossip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally  deciding she’d waited long enough, Minako causally turned to Usagi.  “Did you get a hold of Rei? Was she going to be able to make it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  question was a farce. She’d felt Rei’s eyes on her the moment she’d  walked through that door, and it had taken every ounce of willpower  she’d had to keep from running directly to her. But Minako knew the  most effective ways to Rei’s heart, and playing hard to get was one of  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She was with us just a second ago,” Ami began uncertainly, “oh, there she is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Earth to Rei-chan?” Makoto teased her gaping friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Halfway  across the room, the miko still hadn’t moved, but it wasn’t the  irritation she harbored, her basis of avoiding Minako, that kept her at  bay. It was simply that as soon as she’d seen the other woman walk in,  she was struck by the intense realization of just how much she’d missed  her. That, and the miniskirt the idol wore which allowed for an ample  amount of leg didn’t help her in the diverting of her eyes department,  either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow, Rei managed to pick her jaw up off the floor,  and as Minako approached to the foreground, the background that was her  friends faded away, and although she was sure they were still talking  amongst themselves, it seemed deathly quiet to her. Coming to a  hesitant halt in that awkward space between a handshake and a hug,  Minako pinned Rei with caramel eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>How is it possible for her to have grown even more irresistible?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>The posters and TV interviews do her beauty no justice.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Perhaps  they stared at each other a little too long, for a very unsubtle  clearing of one’s throat caught the two women off guard. Minako spurred  herself into motion, closing the gap between herself and Rei and  embracing the other woman in a loose hug. The miko, though somewhat  upset with herself for not sticking to her guns on showing her  irritation with the idol, made to return her friends’ gesture when her  heightened senses picked up the distant scent of sulfur and a harsh  voice carried on a non-existent wind...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Mars, Retreat!” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  senses heightened, Rei stood stark still while she tried to catch the  fleeting traces of the one remembrance she could never seem to grasp,  the one and only thing that could have possibly distracted her  attention from the woman embracing her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, Minako awkwardly  pulled away from her seemingly frozen friend. A slight frown captured  the singer’s lips. Having sensed a change in the other woman, the  haunted look in Rei’s wide eyes didn’t go unnoticed. There were a  million questions Minako wanted to ask, but as the others convened on  them once more, tugging at their resident idol, she knew those answers,  if she could wrestle them from the stubborn miko at all, would have to  wait.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With the girls having pulled Minako away and surrounded her  at the table in the center of the room to continue fawning over her,  Rei found that she could almost breathe again. Feigning interest in  Makoto’s ad, still secured loosely between her fingers, she shakily  found a seat on one of the couches, and though she couldn’t place her  finger on the memory she searched for, another deemed to find her...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars’  senses were on full alert. She was in danger. Someone was very  carefully, very skillfully, tracking her movements. An attack was  imminent. The hair on the back of her neck stood on end and in half a  second, the flames of Mars engulfed her, bringing her transformation  into the senshi of fire to fruition. A quick dodge carried her to  safety before she turned to meet her attacker.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Show yourself!” She barked.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>From the darkness of the empty hallway, a highly subdued crescent beam streaked past her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Ve…Venus!? What is the meaning of this?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The senshi of love and beauty stepped forward from her concealed position, her form shrouded in shadow. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Consider this training.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Venus  smirked, a predator’s smile, before pouncing at her prey. Another round  of crescent beams, this time not quite so innocent, were lobbed in  Mars’ direction. The senshi of fire deftly dodged each one and  deflected the last back at her leader with a skilled burning mandala of  her own. When the ripples of heat born from Mars’ flame dissipated,  their eyes met in fiery competition. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Never let your guard down. An attack can come at any time, from any where, from any </em>one<em>.” Venus’ defensive stance relaxed and she nodded at her team mate. “Lesson learned. Nicely done, Mars.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In  a flash of golden light, Venus detransformed, looking none the less  magnificent in a pair of low cut, loose cloth pants and a sheer, skimpy  top that left less to Mars’ imagination than Venus’ fuku had. After a  moment’s hesitation, Mars followed suit, only, in the space of her  detransformation, she found herself being tackled by the slender, yet  deceivingly strong arms of her leader. The slightly shorter woman  wrestled her second in command against the wall of the palace, gaining  leverage on the confused woman and pinning her arms to the wall.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  two stilled in the dark silence, the only sound being their slightly  labored breathing. Minako flashed a quirky half-smile at her captive. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What does this have to do with training?” Mars’ voice was a hoarse whisper.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Absolutely nothing.” Minako’s reply, a hair’s breadth from the other woman’s ear, sent a chill down the senshi of fire’s spine. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And then, Minako released her prey, departing in a sultry saunter, never once looking back over her shoulder.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  a snort, Rei looked down to find a neat set of marks left by her  fingernails in Makoto’s now torn ad, though honestly, she didn’t know  if the pressure applied was a result of being mad or… excited by her  latest vision. A quick check of her pulse quickly confirmed it was the  later, but still, why did these random memories have to come to her at  the most inconvenient of times?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was then that the miko  remembered something from her past, a nagging voice from five years  ago. It was a voice she had loathed, but it was also a voice that she  had been powerless to resist... Minako’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Have you remembered anything yet? From the past life?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then… were <em>these</em> the memories that Minako had been so adamant that Rei should regain  five years ago? Perhaps it wasn’t their lives as senshi on the moon or  the final battle that had ended the Silver Millennium, but the  relationship that Venus and Mars had shared in that era that Minako had  held so important? But… if these memories <em>were</em> what Minako had wanted Rei to remember, what did she expect from her once she’d regained them?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  questions lined themselves up in Rei’s head, but she knew they had no  answers. Not unless she got them directly from Minako, and that wasn’t  a step she was ready to take. Not until she understood how this  development affected her own confused emotions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Right now, I’ll keep remembering, keep collecting my thoughts, and not say or do anything until I understand more.’</em> Although she was hesitant to admit it, Rei realized that she didn’t  know if it was the effect of the memories of Venus and Mars, or if it  was her own desire, but she was acutely aware that the longer she  looked at the object of her confusion, the harder it became to keep her  hands to herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sitting up straight, shoulders squared, Rei  nodded with conviction in her plan, yet was well aware that when she  glanced at Minako through the corner of her eye, her action wasn’t  entirely accidental. But could she possibly blame herself when she was  granted a candid view of the senshi of beauty in her element? Head  slightly tipped back, eyes wide with laughter, a graceful smile tugging  at her lips…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And it was exactly then that that damnable woman  made eye contact, and though Rei blushed and diverted her gaze, she’d  seen the triumphant smirk on Minako’s tempting lips. She almost choked  on her own breath when, feeling Minako’s gaze still on her, the idol  stood from her seat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was only ten feet between the table and  the couch, but as Minako closed the distance, time slowed to a crawl  for the panicking miko. She was vaguely aware of her other friends at  the table, squabbling over whose turn it was for a round of karaoke,  but at the very least, it created a decent distraction for the two to  speak somewhat privately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei sat stiffly as her closest friend  sat a little too close for comfort. She struggled to find that  irritation she needed to face the singer confidently. <em>‘Remember you’re mad at her. Remember you’re mad at her.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are you so pissy about?” Minako’s teasing voice was sweet and  melodious, and Rei found she had to dig even deeper to remain upset.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would it have been too much to at least let your closest friend know you were coming back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  quizzical smile played on Minako’s lips. Imposing and condescending,  Rei may have looked the part, but the hint of betrayal that laced her  voice had given her away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ara, but it seems you already knew I was coming back today anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Rei almost hissed in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan told me you knew I was coming back. That the flame of a candle told you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  allowed herself the briefest pause, unwilling to let the precious  moment of a deer-in-the-headlights Rei to go by without cherishing it.  And although she would have liked to tease the miko more, she knew  she’d have to wait for the right time and place to get the answers she  wanted, for she knew better than anyone that Rei had very clearly  defined boundaries that mustn’t be crossed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I mean, I should have realized Usagi had actually been <em>with</em> you last night when I spoke to her, but I must not have paid enough  attention, because when I flew into Kyoto instead of Narita early this  morning-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Despite herself, Rei gasped. “You… went to Kyoto first?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako flashed a crooked grin. “I was <em>trying</em> to surprise you, so I was disappointed to find you weren’t at your  shrine. I thought I could drag you to Tokyo with me for a few days, but  it seemed you’d already beaten me here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s fading irritation  became harder and harder to hold on to, especially after that last  comment, but still, she preserved, crossing her arms sternly and  crinkling her nose in displeasure. “I’m sure <em>that</em> caused quite a stir, you stopping at my shrine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bet you’ll have a few questions to answer when you return. Unlike <em>you</em> when we first met, the younger ones recognized me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  flashed the “v” for victory, partnered with a light jab to the miko’s  ribs. Finally, Rei squarely met Minako’s eyes and as the two women  fought to keep themselves from falling into one another’s’ gazes, they  decided on simultaneous laughter instead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And just like that, the  spell was broken. Rei had saved face, Minako had played her games, and  they were free to be friends again… until the next inevitable dispute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi  was bouncing off the walls. Literally. With two long, thin pieces of  paper cradled to her chest, she bounced excitedly from one end of the  room to the other. Rei, Makoto and Ami, somewhat more subdued, but  equally excited, crowded around Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So we’ll all get  together back stage this time next week?” Makoto asked wide eyed,  handling her ticket and access pass as if they were made of gold, and  considering the fact that they wouldn’t go on sale to the general  public until the next day, they probably were worth it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re sure this is okay? I mean, I don’t want to impose, I know how busy-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami’s  concern was cut short by Usagi’s hand over her mouth. Minako waved away  Ami’s concern and Usagi’s sudden panic, and found herself laughing when  her suddenly exhausted princess let out an sigh of relief and went limp  against Ami’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone stayed up past their bedtime.” Rei chided their princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi raised her head and pouted like a petulant child. “One more song.” She demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei groaned but her other three friends gave way to their future queen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  found three sets of eyes staring at her expectantly, to which she  politely declined, “I have to pass, I’m on break until the concert next  week.” When she was met with three sighs of discontentment, she offered  the next best thing, “Come on Rei, it’s your turn anyway. Why don’t you  show us some of that Mars Reiko talent?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her posture becoming suddenly rigid, Rei’s words were a detached whisper. “Mars… Reiko…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’d  just about had it with her second in command and her stubborn  subordinate was about to bear the brunt of that frustration. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You  listen here, Mars-” Venus Minako deflated. In the past two months since  she’d been working alongside the senshi of fire, she’d never learned  the woman’s given name. Even the other girls called her Mars. “Just  what </em>is<em> your real name, anyway?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The equally angry  raven haired girl visibly deflated as well, the stubborn righteousness  that nearly matched her superior’s own dissipated in a heartbeat. She  glanced away uncomfortably. “I... I don’t have one.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Don’t  have one?” All traces of animosity gone, the tenseness slipped out of  Minako’s shoulders as her posture relaxed. Her voice softened. “How  could you not have a name?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars’ fingers tightened into  fists, her posture affecting the opposite of her leader’s. The sudden  concern from her self proclaimed leader, from </em>anyone,<em> felt foreign, frightening. “I… was born into my station. I served no other purpose to my family.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  raven haired woman chewed her lower lip tentatively. She’d never felt  the need to tell anyone so private an affair before. Why reveal this  deep hurt to this infuriatingly vexing woman? Surely, she’d be  ridiculed for showing such weakness. She chanced a glance at her  superior to find unsuppressed compassion in those achingly beautiful  caramel eyes. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Instead of questions, instead of  condemnation, instead of laughter, Minako laid a supportive hand on  Mars’ shoulder. Her normally strict expression slipped and she gave the  other woman a gentle and honest smile. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Well then, Mars </em>Reiko<em>, now that you have a given name, I can properly scold you with it.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t just a stage name.” The miko’s voice was a mere whisper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  looked up, startled to see Makoto sitting on the couch next to her. Ami  and Usagi were on stage, finishing up their rendition of one of  Minako’s latest songs. It was one of Rei’s favorites, but at the  moment, it was only serving to give her a headache. Her head was  spinning at her newest revelation granted by her latest vision. There  was no longer any doubt in her mind that the memories Minako had wanted  her to regain five years ago were of their relationship together, and  that back then, Minako had tried to trigger those memories with her  Mars Reiko stunt...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But her attempt had failed. Rei hadn’t remembered...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And she was taking entirely too long to answer Makoto.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, it was nothing,” Rei assured her friend. “Nothing at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  when she glanced sideways at Minako, sitting at the other end of the  couch, she couldn’t help but notice her friend’s critical glare, as  though she were summing Rei up, as though she were assessing a  situation she already knew the answer to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei felt a shiver  travel down her spine. She was so badly shaken she didn’t know whether  she wanted to push Minako away or pull her towards her, to smack that  all knowing smirk off her beautiful face, or to kiss those utterly  tempting lips. All she knew for certain was that she couldn’t stand  Minako’s silent gaze any longer. So Rei expressed her emotions the only  way she knew how.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You got a staring problem?” She challenged her former leader.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t… can’t you stare elsewhere then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe I already like what I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you, some elementary school kid?” She’d meant to come off as witty and unaffected, but she was failing miserably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um, Minako-chan?” Ami interjected politely, sensing the coming storm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  just playing to your level.” Minako smirked coolly. It was too easy.  The hardest part was keeping the smile off her face while she watched  Rei slowly loose it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto made a valiant effort, “Uh, Rei-chan-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh would you grow up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Guys!”  Even their princess couldn’t pull the two girls out of their school  girl squabble. She turned to Ami and Makoto with a helpless pout.  “They’re two peas in a pod. They may as well be made for each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They can <em>have</em> each other.” Makoto grumbled. “At this rate, they won’t even notice us leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here we go again,” Ami sighed, “some things never change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where did everyone go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  performed a visual check. It hadn’t been the first time one of their  heated squabbles had left them in another world. “They left us again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  snorted and Minako laughed. Arguing seemed to be an integral part of  their relationship, no matter how much they’d matured and grown closer.  As if on cue, both women relaxed back into the couch, but when their  fingers inadvertently brushed against each other, Minako felt Rei  stiffen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was now or never.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei, have you sensed a new threat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko’s brows furrowed. She didn’t need to be psychic to sense a trap. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi  said you saw me last night. In the flame of a candle.” For the first  time that night, Minako hesitated. “I know that… you had that ability  in the past, to sense danger even from dimmest of flames. Being your  leader, you would always come to me afterwards. I thought maybe-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not like that.” Rei’s words tumbled from her mouth. Bent over slightly  so that her long bangs hid her dark eyes, she stared at her hands.  “It’s not… it’s not danger I sensed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The idol’s hopes soared as  one of the two possible reasons for Rei to regain such a powerful  ability was eliminated. “Then,” Minako paused, her heart in her throat,  “are you remembering your past life?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako could feel the  anxiety rolling off of her best friend in waves. She examined the  uncertain look on Rei’s features, and for a moment, she didn’t know  whether the other woman would laugh or cry, scream or whisper. She  wanted to get the pensive miko to open up to her, to ease her fears, to  talk it all out and draw some conclusions. She just wanted to <em>hold</em> her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  opened her mouth. “… I…” She stopped and shut her eyes. The memories,  the revelations both past and present, the very act of being so close  to the object of her confusion, were starting to overload her senses.  She wanted off this emotional rollercoaster ride, before she did or  said something she regretted, and she knew she couldn’t trust herself  to say the right thing. Not now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The long haired woman stood up with a sudden conviction. “I have to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?” Minako leapt to her feet, grabbing her closest friend by the wrist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She couldn’t meet Minako’s gaze. “I have shrine duties in the morning. I’ve already stayed out too late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  reluctantly released her hold on the miko, but when Rei finally turned  to look at her, the singer had a warm grin for her friend. Although the  idol wanted to pursue her cause further, she also knew not to push the  envelope, that, given the situation, it would be better to put some  distance between herself and her best friend. The further away she  retreated, she knew Rei would follow, just like she used to. She just  had to believe in her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So then, I’ll see you next week at the concert, right?” The singer offered brightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  breathed a sigh of relief, thankful she was being given the distance  she needed. Still, on instinct, she stuck her nose in the air. “That  depends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Depends?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will you be sticking around after the concert, or will you be hitting the road again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  smiled coyly. She wasn’t the only one who wanted to spend a little  alone time together. “I think I’ll stick around for awhile.” She  returned, equally non-committal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, Rei smiled back at her best friend. “Then, I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s Notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So?  What do you think now that they’ve finally met again? I’m sure everyone  saw the Mars Reiko scene coming. I think every PGSM author likes to  make their own version of that one. The next chapter may be a little  static, but it’s one of my favorites where Rei will remember much of  her previous life, so stick with me, because the Rei/Minako fluff will  be fun.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chapter 5 preview:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  senshi of love released a squeal of surprise that was hushed by  familiar lips. Her magazine fell to the floor forgotten as her lover’s  arms slipped around her waist and she was pushed back against the edge  of the counter. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Someone might see us.” Minako’s words  were a quiet whisper in Reiko’s ear. It was a statement with no  inflection, nor was it laced with fear. Ever practical, she was simply  identifying a possibility. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I,” Reiko kissed the corner  of Minako’s mouth, “don’t,” she nipped Minako’s bottom lip with her  teeth, “care.” she fully claimed possession of the other woman’s lips.</em></span></p>
