<h1>A Tired Heart's Desire (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/balticbard.html">Balticbard</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/tiredhart-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The monster raged furiously, it&#39;s growls seeming like thunder, making 
the roof of the building that it stood on, tremble, and the earth 
beneath the building quake. 

The monstrous, tentacled creature moved quickly, raising havoc, as it 
threw everything within it&#39;s reach over the edge of the battered roof, 
and down onto the streets below, as a rain of destruction upon the 
heads of screaming onlookers, and desperate tenants that tried to get 
out of the way, out of the building that the monster would most 
certainly destroy. 

The monster roared loudly, trying its best to instill fear in the puny 
humans in the streets below. The monster waved it&#39;s tentacles, and made 
it&#39;s many eyes glow with a strange, unearthly light. In short, the 
monster was doing it&#39;s very best to appear frightening, because that 
was his job, the reason that SHE had summoned him, then brought him to 
this world. 

SHE had opened a portal to his world, and had called him. Bewildered, 
and confused, the monster had responded to the woman&#39;s call, curious as 
to why a human would invoke him. She spoke eloquently to him. She 
promised him what he had always dreamt of; she would give him human 
form, and a life amongst humans on earth. That was what the monster had 
always desired; to escape his miserable, lonely existence on his dead 
planet, to be human, to have a companion, to be loved, to live in 
sunlight. All he had to do in return for the woman, was to kill someone 
for her. It didn&#39;t matter to the monster that he would have to commit 
murder to achieve his dream; he was capable of slaughtering a million 
times over if it meant that he could become human. 

The monster roared once more, quite sure that the Sailor Scouts would 
come to confront him. He was supposed to kill one of the Scouts; the 
one who wore orange, and white, a blond one, who wore the mark of 
Venus....then SHE would make him human in return, and he would live 
happily for the rest of his life on earth. 

Suddenly, the monster saw the Sailor Scouts appear; five, bright lights 
that materialized out of no where, each light taking human shape, then 
standing defiantly before him. 

The Sailor scouts surrounded the monster; he already knew them well by 
the descriptions that SHE had given him; the tall one in green was 
Jupiter, the one with short hair, in blue was Mercury, the one in white 
was the leader, Sailor Moon, and off to one side stood the most 
beautiful of the group;the voluptuous, raven-haired one in red was 
Mars, and the last one in orange, a blond girl was his intended victim; 
VENUS. 

&quot;Surround it!&quot; Serena yelled at the Sailors, for she was their 
princess, their leader, &quot;Jupiter, Mercury, to the left, Venus to the 
back, Mars stand close to me!&quot; 

&quot;Be careful, Serena, you&#39;re the one facing it directly!&quot; Mercury yelled 
at her princess. 

&quot;Mars......come closer to me!&quot; Sailor Moon exclaimed, as she held her 
hand out to the ravishing Sailor of fire. 

&quot;No....wait.....&quot;Mars said uneasily. Mars didn&#39;t like this order, 
because it placed her much too far from her lover, Venus, who was left 
completely unprotected, a very vulnerable position behind the monster, 
who could very easily turn quickly, and destroy her. Something about 
Serena&#39;s order to her made Mars nervous, &quot;this is wrong.&quot; 

&quot;YOU MUST OBEY ME, MARS!&quot; Serena shouted angrily at her senshi of fire. 

&quot;Yes, my princess,&quot; Mars replied quickly, as she took the place 
indicated by Serena. 

The monster whirled around quickly, and blindly attacked Sailor Venus, 
hitting her with a beam of pure energy, and putting all of his 
fierceness into that one single blow. 

Rei watched in deep horror, as her lover, Venus, was engulfed in a beam 
of energy that the tentacled monster had struck her with. Seconds 
passed, that seemed like an eternity for the beautiful senshi of fire, 
as she sprung into action, squeezing every last ounce of strength from 
her young body, as she tried desperately to reach her lover, Venus. 

Mina, Venus, found herself suddenly paralyzed by an unexpected blow of 
energy that the monster had hurled at her. Venus felt bolts of pure 
pain traveling through her beautiful body, and she heard herself scream 
in terror. Then, Venus saw something that filled her heart with joy, 
yet also with terror; it was her beloved Mars, running towards her, so 
quickly, that the girl seemed to become a colorful blur, &quot;NO, Rei!&quot; 
Venus wanted to shout, but she couldn&#39;t form the words with her mouth, 
yet her mind screamed them, &quot;stay away, Rei! Please! I don&#39;t want you 
to die too!&quot; 

Serena watched in absolute horror, the happenings before her sky blue 
eyes; the gray, tentacled monster striking Venus with a powerful blow 
of energy, then.....unexpectedly, Mars hurling herself between them. 

Serena was trembling now, because this wasn&#39;t supposed to be 
happening....Mars, her beloved Rei, HER Rei, wasn&#39;t supposed to 
interfere. Serena had ordered Mars to stand close beside her, to keep 
the girl as far away as possible from Venus, so that the blond senshi 
of love, the thief who stole Rei from her, would be isolated from the 
rest of the group, when the monster struck her, and finally KILLED her 
with his energy beam. 

Serena&#39;s love, and desire for the ravishing senshi of fire raged within 
her supple breast so deeply, that she was capable of any treachery, 
just to get her beautiful lover back from the arms of Mina, the senshi 
of love, and beauty. Serena had secretly opened a dimensional portal 
with her powerful moon scepter, and had invoked the monster, promising 
it human form, and a human life, if he killed her greatest enemy, 
Sailor Venus. But this wasn&#39;t supposed to happen; Mars wasn&#39;t supposed 
to get in the way. 

&quot;No!&quot; Serena cried out in tears, &quot;NO!&quot; she screamed at the top of her 
voice, as she watched Mars, her life&#39;s desire, quickly intercept the 
energy beam that connected Venus, and the exhausted monster, 
&quot;NNNNNNOOOOO!&quot; Serena&#39;s voice became a long, painful wail, mingled with 
sobs, as she watched her plan to destroy Venus backfire, as she watched 
Rei, her beloved become a human shield for Mina. 

In pure desperation, Rei, Sailor Mars, had hurled herself forward, 
almost seeming to fly, as she extended her arms, and jumped into the 
white light that enveloped her lover, Mina. Within seconds, Mars was 
directly between Venus, and the monster, as she felt the monster&#39;s 
energy enter her body, penetrating her to the very core of her being. 
All that Mars could see before her was nothing but white, blank space, 
as she reached out desperately, trying to find her lover, Venus. Then, 
despite the searing pain that coursed through her, driving her almost 
to the edge of insanity, Mars found Venus, and embraced her. 

Somewhere through the maddening, paralyzing pain, the two lovers found 
each other. Mina, who&#39;s mind had already accepted thoughts of death, 
who&#39;s eye&#39;s were closed in darkness, as she accepted her dark fate, 
suddenly stirred as she felt a familiar warmth engulf her, as she felt 
a familiar, slender arms surround her, holding her tightly. Venus 
smiled through her intense pain, despite her suffering, as her heart 
was flooded with joy, as she opened her eyes, and saw her lover, her 
life&#39;s obsession, Mars, embracing her. &quot;Rei....&quot; Venus said in a 
soundless voice, for in that strange, brief, colorless void where both 
girls were now trapped, there was no sound, &quot;Rei......you came.....now 
I&#39;m not afraid to die.....because I&#39;m taking you with me......&quot; Venus&#39;s 
slender arms came slowly up, and circled Rei&#39;s tiny waist, drawing the 
girl even closer to her, &quot;I love you, Rei.....forever.....in darkness, 
in light.....you belong to me.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Mina.....forever,&quot; Mars replied in what was more of a velvet 
thought, than a verbal sound. 

&quot;My love.....&quot; Venus replied within her mind, as she leaned in, 
forgetting the pain that now flowed through her body, as she tilted her 
blond head slightly, and passionately kissed her voluptuous brunette 
senshi doll, as she parted the girl&#39;s full lips with her tongue. Then, 
as both girls tongues connected, they also felt the electric currents 
rushing through their bodies connect, and become ONE single current of 
energy. 

&quot;NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; Serena&#39;s wail of pain, and anger once more tore 
through the air, frightening Jupiter, and Mercury, and also startling 
the tentacled monster that held Venus, and Mars in the grips of his 
power. 

But Serena, Sailor Moon, had reason to cry, as she watched the Sailor 
lovers kiss, because now she knew that Venus had taken Mars away from 
her forever, that the two girls had bonded even more deeply, that Mars 
was forever lost to her. 

&quot;Sailors Jupiter, and Mercury......attack.....ATTACK! KILL THE BEAST! 
KILL IT NOW!&quot; 

The monster turned suddenly, at the sound of Sailor Moon&#39;s voice. The 
monster was so enraged, that he unconsciously released Venus, and Mars 
from his death beam. The monster turned towards his BETRAYER, towards 
the one who had summoned him there, and had promised him so many 
things, Sailor Moon, determined to kill her, even if it meant that he 
would never be human, that he might even die, but he would be avenged. 
But, before the monster could even form a single thought, he was struck 
from all sides by the combined forces of Jupiter, Mercury, and Sailor 
Moon. In a great wail of bestial pain, the monster was consumed in 
fire, leaving nothing but ashes where he once stood. 

It seemed like an eternity, but actually it had only been about fifteen 
seconds since the now defunct monster had attacked Venus, then about 
ten seconds since Mars had intervened between them, and had become 
engulfed herself in the energy beam with Venus. Now, both girls lay on 
the floor of the building&#39;s rooftop, side by side, unconscious. 

&quot;QUICK!&quot; Mercury yelled, as she, and Jupiter, and Sailor Moon 
approached the two, fallen Sailors, &quot;we have to get them to the lab!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll carry Rei!&quot; Jupiter exclaimed, as she took Mars in her arms, and 
easily lifted the girl up in her arms. 

&quot;I&#39;ll take Mina,&quot; Amy replied, lifting the blond senshi in her slender 
arms. 

Instantly, all of the Sailors began to glow in one, single, bright 
light that intensified for a few seconds, then disappeared as suddenly, 
as it had begun, taking with it, all five Sailors. 

The lab that Amy had mentioned was a secret bunker located 100 feet 
under Tokyo&#39;s most luxurious hotel, &quot;Miramar,&quot; which just happened to 
be the property of a handsome, young playboy named Darian, and a gift 
to him for his twenty first birthday from his obscenely wealthy 
parents. It was in that secret lab equipped with the most modern 
devices, bought with the millionaire allowances of wealthy brats, 
Darian, Serena, Lita, Mina, Amy, and Rei, given to them by their 
wealthy families, that the secret super squad monitored Tokyo, and the 
rest of the world. It was in that secret lab, that both Amy, and 
Darian, super genius minds in science, engineering, and medicine, 
invented new, powerful devices to use in their constant fight against 
the world of crime, and it&#39;s minions, and held the most innovative 
experiments in cloning, and life extension. It was to that secret lab, 
that the Sailors took their fallen sisters, Venus, and Mars, aka; Mina, 
and Rei. 

Two hours had passed since Amy had placed Mina, and Rei into seperate, 
life sustaining glass tubes filled with a liquid that resembled 
embrionic fluid, monitored their life signs, and sustained them alive. 
Amy had watched the progress of her two dear, friends. Lita had gone to 
fetch Darian. Serena hadn&#39;t stopped pacing, or crying for the entire 
two hours. 

&quot;This is impossible!&quot; Amy cried, as she checked the computer monitoring 
both Mina, and Rei. 

&quot;What is it, Amy?&quot; Serena asked anxiously. 

&quot;Serena....princess,&quot; Amy said respectfully, as she bowed before Sailor 
Moon. Of all the Sailors, Amy was the most reverant, respectful, and 
loyal towards Serena. Amy was also secretly in love with Serena, but 
suffered in silence, knowing that her affection would never be 
returned, because Serena was deeply in love with Rei, the senshi of 
fire, &quot;Serena....Mina, and Rei&#39;s life signs have changed drastically 
since they were brought here to the lab.&quot; 

&quot;So? Will they survive, Amy?&quot; Serena asked, quite preplexed, &quot;is this 
good, or bad?&quot; 

&quot;Well, Serena....it depends....when Mina, and Rei were put in the life-
sustaining tubes, their vital signs were erractic, but DIFFERENT. Now, 
their vital signs are EXACTLY THE SAME!&quot; 

&quot;That is impossible, Amy!&quot; 

&quot;But that is what the readouts from the computer monitoring them is 
giving me, Serena. Mina, and Rei now have the same blood pressure, the 
same pulse, the same EXACT brain wave patterns....I&#39;ve even checked 
further; they both now have the same blood type, the same exact count 
of red blood cells, and white blood cells, their DNA patterns have 
altered, so that they now have the same one, hair follicles, and skin 
cells match exactly on the both of them. Right now, at this very 
INSTANT, both Mina, and Rei&#39;s hearts are beating at the same EXACT 
rhythm. Outwardly, their appearances are as always; but inwardly, they 
appear to be EXACT duplicates; CLONES of each other; from height, to 
weight, to body measurements.&quot; 

&quot;NO!&quot; Serena yelled, &quot;that musn&#39;t happen!&quot; 

&quot;But it has happened, Serena. Whatever the creature did to 
them....is.....well it has just begun. The effects of that creature&#39;s 
beam hit Mina, and almost killed her, and almost drained her completely 
of her life source. If it hadn&#39;t been for Rei intervening when she did, 
Mina might have been killed.&quot; 

&quot;I know,&quot; Serena replied quietly. 

&quot;The only explanation that I can think of, Serena, is that Mina is 
somehow living off Rei....Rei&#39;s life source is keeping Mina alive.&quot; 

&quot;Then the two of them can&#39;t be seperated?&quot; Serena asked, still hoping 
that somehow there was one, last, desperate way to recover Rei for 
herself. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think that we should seperate them for now, Serena. I think we 
should keep them both here in the lab for at least a few weeks. Maybe 
these conditions are temporary, and will reverse themselves 
automatically, and Mina, and Rei will return to their normal selves.&quot; 

&quot;Maybe....&quot;Serena whispered hopefully. 

&quot;There is just one, last, disturbing detail, Serena,&quot; Amy said 
anxiously. 

&quot;What is it, Amy?&quot; 

&quot;Well....Serena, both Mina, and Rei&#39;s life signs are slowly evolving, 
slowly becoming LESS human. The effects seem to be greater in 
Mina....she is metamorphing....and.....well.....she is slowly taking 
Rei with her.&quot; 

&quot;I want you to save Rei, Amy!&quot; 

&quot;But.....what about Mina? I can&#39;t just let her......&quot; 

&quot;You MUST obey me, Amy. I don&#39;t care about Mina. I WANT YOU TO SAVE 
REI!&quot; 

&quot;Yes, princess,&quot; Amy replied, as she bowed obediently, casting her eyes 
downward, to hide her true sentiments, that she would disobey Serena, 
that she would try to save BOTH Mina, and Rei. 

Serena turned, and walked away, thoroughly convinced that Amy would 
obey her blindly. 

After a few hours of monitoring both Mina, and Rei, Amy moved them to 
an available room with two seperate beds with Darian&#39;s help, who 
carried each one at a time in his arms, and placed them on their 
respective beds. 

Rei finally regained consciousness, after almost four hours of what 
seemed to be a coma-like state. The senshi of fire was up, and around 
almost immediately, much to Amy&#39;s surprise. 

&quot;Amy?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Rei, I&#39;m here,&quot; Amy replied soothingly, as she went quickly to 
the beautiful brunette, who had just sat up in her bed. Amy sat next to 
her dear friend, and lovingly ran her hand through the stray, silky 
locks that fell on Rei&#39;s smooth, alabaster forehead, &quot;how do you 
feel?&quot; 

&quot;How is Mina?&quot; was all that Rei could say, it was all that she could 
think of now. 

&quot;Mina survived the creature&#39;s attack thanks to your intervention, 
Rei,&quot; Amy replied calmly, with a smile, as she gently took the girl&#39;s 
hand in her own, &quot;she almost got killed, Rei....but you saved 
her....and almost lost your own life doing it.&quot; 

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, Amy.........&quot; 

&quot;Rei.....&quot; 

&quot;Hhhhmmmmm?&quot; Rei felt a great wave of relief overwhelm her heart, as 
she sighed, for in the darkness of her mind, as she lay trapped in her 
deep coma, she had screamed like a maddened animal, in a dream where 
she had arrived too late, and her golden angel had died. 

&quot;Just lie back down, and go to sleep, Rei.....&quot; 

&quot;What about....Mina?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about her, Rei....&quot; Amy said reassuringly to her friend, 
&quot;she is still asleep, and I will be right here to look after her, and 
you......now just relax, and get some rest.&quot; 

&quot;Oh......yes.....thank you......Amy......&quot; Rei&#39;s beautiful, cerulean 
eyes closed, covered by her long, thick, dark lashes, as the ravishing, 
raven-haired senshi slipped into a peaceful sleep. 

Dark, and light swatches of reality fought before her muddled mind, as 
Mina suddenly recovered her consciousness, and returned to reality. 
Slowly, Mina returned to life, as in her prison of darkness, trapped in 
her quiet maddenss, she had screamed in sheer desperation, amid a dream 
where she survived the monster&#39;s attack, and her stunningly beautiful, 
senshi doll of fire was torn forever from her arms by the cold claws fo 
death, &quot;RRREEEEEIIIIIII!&quot; 

&quot;Mina!&quot; Amy was quickly at the beautiful blond&#39;s side, trying 
desperately to comfort her, &quot;Mina.....don&#39;t....Rei is fine.....she just 
went back to sleep......just now......&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you.....where is she, Amy?&quot; Mina exclaimed 
frantically, &quot;you&#39;re just humoring me......you&#39;re lying to 
me.......Rei......my Rei is dead!&quot; 

&quot;You BOTH survived, Mina......please believe me!&quot; 

&quot;Rei......&quot; Mina whispered weakly, &quot;Amy.....I&#39;m so weak....so 
tired......everything is spinning around.....&quot; 

&quot;You have to keep still, Mina.....just lie back down, and don&#39;t move 
your head too much.&quot; 

&quot;Amy.....I&#39;m slipping away........everything is getting so dark......&quot; 

&quot;NO! MINA, STAY AWAKE!&quot; Amy panicked, because it was evident that the 
blond senshi of love was dying right before her very eyes. 

At that very instant, Rei woke up, and sat up in bed, &quot;Amy? AMY!&quot; Rei 
called out, &quot;help me....get beside her!&quot; 

Amy did as Rei bid her. Swiftly, Amy helped a weak, shaky Rei get up 
from her bed, and moved her the short distance to Mina&#39;s bed. Amy then 
helped Rei sit next to the now unconscious Mina. 

Amy was shocked to see Mina wake up, and respond when Rei simply 
touched her. Mina instantly recovered at her ravishing lover&#39;s touch. 

&quot;Rei....&quot; Mina sighed, as a weak smile lit her pale lips, and her eyes 
glowed with a deep, sapphire fire, as she took the beautiful girl in 
her arms. 

&quot;Its incredible!&quot; Amy thought to herself, &quot;Mina really is living off 
Rei&#39;s life source....just now, she was dying....and now.....just 
touching Rei brought her back!&quot; 

&quot;Rei....my Rei....&quot; Mina whispered, as she moved painfully to one side, 
making room on her small bed for her precious lover, &quot;I love you so 
much....&quot; 

&quot;I know.....&quot; Rei replied, in what seemed like a low, velvety sigh that 
made the lovely blond tremble, &quot;I can feel your love.....I love you 
too, Mina......&quot; 

&quot;I can feel you inside me, Rei.....&quot;Mina said softly, as she took her 
gorgeous lover into her arms. 

The stunning brunette was silent now, as she settled into her blond 
lover&#39;s slender arms. The senshi of fire lay her dark head on Mina&#39;s 
shoulder, and fell asleep quickly. Nothing more was said between the 
two, gorgeous, shenshi lovers, as they entered their world of dreams, 
as their long, silky manes settled around their heads in mixed shades 
of an evening, setting sun; half day, half night. 

&quot;Oh.....I can&#39;t tell this to Serena!&quot; Amy said with worry, and 
desperation filling her heart. 

&quot;What can&#39;t you tell me, Amy?&quot; 

Amy was startled to see Serena in the small room, standing beside her, 
looking down disapprovingly at the two, sleeping Sailor senshis on the 
small bed, &quot;tell me what, Amy?&quot; 

&quot;Mina, and Rei&#39; connection is deeper than I originally thought, 
Serena.&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean, Amy?&quot; 

&quot;I think that they have only ONE mind between them, Serena....I don&#39;t 
think that their condition can be reversed.&quot; 

Serena simply started to cry, as she fell on her knees, before the bed 
where Mina slept with Rei in her arms. Violent sobs wracking Serena&#39;s 
slender body, and thick tears blinded her beautiful, sky blue eys, as 
she reached out with a trembling hand, and tangled her fingers in Rei&#39;s 
silky, raven tresses.
