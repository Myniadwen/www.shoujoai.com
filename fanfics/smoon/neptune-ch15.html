<p>It was a rainy Saturday in late March of 1992. Two figures faced off  in a park, surrounded by trees and a small brook with a small stone  bridge nearby to bear witness. The girl got a message to come here, and  brought an umbrella with her. On non-rainy days the park could be quite  beautiful, and perhaps her boyfriend wished to take advantage of the  setting for some romantic purpose. When she got to their rendezvous  point however, she could see in his eyes what was coming even before he  said it.</p>
<p>&quot;A huge girl like you just isn't my type.&quot;</p>
<p>The  speaker, a high school senior, immediately regretted his choice of  words when he noticed the effect they had on his girlfriend Makoto. The  girl let her umbrella drop, cold rain droplets fell on her and mixed  with the tears that were running down her cheeks. He couldn't bear the  look of pain and devastation in her eyes any longer, and so he turned  and left, leaving the brunette with the ponytail standing there in the  rain as she felt her whole world crumbling.</p>
<p>He walked out the  west gate, turned right, and passed Michiru as she was walking in the  opposite direction. She wore a tan rain coat and held a black umbrella  above her head as she made her way down the sidewalk, checking her  watch as she proceeded past a post office box. Coming to the end of the  block, which met at a four way intersection, she turned left to face  the westward flow of traffic. Her teeth were starting to chatter a bit  in the cold wet weather as she checked her watch again. Right on time,  just like clockwork, she heard the motor in the distance. Even in the  crowded streets of Tokyo traffic, the sound of Haruka Tenoh's new  motorcycle was distinct.</p>
<p>She looked up from her watch. Haruka  wore her red motorcycle gear today. Michiru mused over whether she  might've worn that one today because the red gear was warmer or perhaps  more water resistant. She watched silently but intently as the other  girl rode up to the intersection, waited for the green light, then sped  off down the road away from her. Ten-thirty, just like clockwork.</p>
<p>She  turned once Haruka was out of sight. Over the last three months she'd  watched a great deal of Haruka Tenoh. She now knew that the girl loved  salads, especially the caesar salad she ordered at a restaurant near  the garage she frequented. She knew that she craved speed, whether it  came from running, driving or motorcycle riding. And she'd also  observed that for all her flirting she didn't seem to have anyone in  her life, at least not long-term. She observed all this and more over  the past few months, from a distance.</p>
<p>That was all about to change.</p>
<p>In  a few days, weather permitting, the first inter-school track meet of  the season would happen. Boys and girls from at least five schools  would be participating in the events, and she'd already secured herself  a ticket for the event. Elsa Gray would be there too, participating  both the hurdles and the thousand meter. Michiru planned to ask Elsa to  introduce her to Haruka.</p>
<p>&quot;Shouldn't you be practicing your violin, Michiru-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  looked behind her, startled a bit to see Pluto walking up behind her.  The Guardian of the Time Gate was in disguise, but her aura gave her  away to the young violinist. She was dressed fashionably in a dark blue  jacket over a skirt and blouse that showed off her curves and long  legs. She held a matching blue umbrella, and once she caught up with  Michiru the two began to walk together. &quot;I understand a painting of  yours is going to be on exhibit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai, it's to be shown during a  charity event aboard a private yacht. I made a painting of my  nightmares. I've seen the end of the world so many times in my sleep I  decided I needed to capture it on canvas, to make it tangible. Do you  know,&quot; she said, turning to Pluto with a half-smile, &quot;I've done  paintings of flowers, landscapes, nuns and fellow students. It took a  painting of death and destruction though for me to get noticed by  others.&quot; She looked ahead once more as she added, &quot;I'm also going to be  playing my violin on the night of the showing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I know. I  have the program,&quot; Pluto said, pulling the flier for the event out of  her jacket pocket. &quot;That's why I asked if you shouldn't be practicing  your violin right now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're right of course,&quot; Michiru answered. &quot;I just wanted to see her again though, to be in her presence once more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you decided upon a course of action?&quot; Pluto asked as they neared the bus depot.</p>
<p>&quot;Hai. I plan to approach her after the track meets in three days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like my help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Thank you, but I want... I <em>need</em> to do this myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto smiled. &quot;I understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan, what are you doing out this way?&quot;</p>
<p>Both  Michiru and Pluto turned to see Sister Claire coming up behind them  carrying an umbrella and two shopping bags filled with groceries and  plant fertilizer. She'd been out shopping with the salary the school  provided for her, and was on her way to the bus depot to head back to  her greenhouse.</p>
<p>&quot;Konichiwa, Claire-sama,&quot; Michiru said, &quot;We,  ah... We were just out out to walk through the park to find interesting  landscapes for me to paint, when this rain seemed to come out of  nowhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that may be, but look at you. You're chilled  right to the bone.&quot; Sister Claire then turned her attention to  Michiru's companion. &quot;Konichiwa, my name is Sister Claire, and you are?&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto and Michiru looked from the nun to each other and then back to the nun again.</p>
<p>&quot;Who, this?&quot; Michiru asked as her mind quickly formulated a response, &quot;Why, this is my older cousin, Meioh-san.&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto arched an eyebrow at that. The Japanese word for the planet Pluto was <em>Meiosei</em>. In one fell swoop Michiru gave her a name and made a play on words at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  nice to meet you, Meioh-san,&quot; Sister Claire said as she bowed politely  to Pluto. &quot;I'm sorry though, I didn't catch your first name.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru looked nervous, &quot;Her first name...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Setsuna,&quot; Pluto answered quickly, &quot;My name's Setsuna Meioh.&quot;</p>
<p>Now it was Michiru's turn to look surprised. &quot;Setsuna&quot; was the Japanese term for <em>momentary</em>,  which could be seen as a way of integrating her nature as temporal  guardian into her name. It could also be seen as a play on &quot;setsunai&quot;  though, the Japanese word for <em>painful</em>. Given her solitary  nature as the Guardian of the Gates of Time, Michiru half suspected  that Pluto meant both meanings in the name.</p>
<p>&quot;Setsuna?&quot; Sister  Claire asked as the bus came up to its appointed stop, &quot;That's a rather  pretty name, isn't it? Are you coming with your cousin on the bus?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot;  Pluto answered, &quot;I was just here to see her to the depot.  Michiru-chan,&quot; she said as she turned back to her fellow Senshi, &quot;Why  don't you help Sister Claire with her bags, and we'll talk again  later.&quot; She then leaned in and whispered, &quot;And good luck.&quot;</p>
<p>Pluto  turned away as Michiru and Sister Claire got on the bus. She walked  into the now abandoned park just as the rain began to pick up steam,  changed into her Senshi form and disappeared into the Time Gate once  more.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>She took another long swig straight  from the bottle, welcoming the buzz and intoxication that went along  with it like an old familiar friend. The phone next to the computer  monitor rang. She frowned, knowing who it was. Taking another gulp, she  answered it. &quot;Whuzzup, professor-sama?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zultan,&quot; the voice asked on the other end, &quot;Are you drinking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O- only a l-l-little,&quot; she slurred, &quot;Helps me t' think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, well I hope you're busy thinking of how to fix your debacles as of late. Have you killed Sailor Neptune yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she admitted, &quot;N-not yet. But I 'ave a p-plan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; the Professor asked skeptically, &quot;And what might that be?&quot;</p>
<p>Zultan smiled as she reached over and lit a cigarette. &quot;Give me two po-o-ods and I'll tell ya...&quot;</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Elsa  Gray looked up past the grandstands. It was a bit nippy after the last  two days of rain, but today there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Looking at  her competition, she saw a familiar face. So Haruka had decided to keep  the boy's haircut, it would seem. Thinking back, she didn't know if  she'd ever spoken to her before. She'd run on the outside of the pack  last time, so chances were that the blonde probably didn't even notice  her last time. That gave her a chance at a possible psych-out. With a  smirk, she decided to walk over.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p><em>Haruka  stood in the streets and watched as the skies turned blood. The  darkness once more began to swallow everything into itself, just as it  always did during all her nightmares lately. She couldn't run away, it  moved too quickly for that. All she could do was watch in horror at the  devastation.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The silence is approaching.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Haruka  turned. The girl in the funny sailor outfit was there too, floating in  the air above her. Her eyes were closed, and her hands were clasped  together in a prayer like fashion. Around her, a sea-green aura seemed  to shine.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;We must find the Messiah quickly. The ones who  can do that are you, and I.&quot; She opened her eyes and looked down at  Haruka, her pleading gaze cutting into the blonde as everything began  to go blurry...</em></p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Haruka came to with a  start. She pinched the bridge of her nose and closed her eyes as she  tried to calm down. &quot;That again,&quot; she whispered. The vision was a  familiar one by now. This was, however, the first time she could  remember ever having had it while awake. That fact alone left her a bit  shaken.</p>
<p>&quot;I hear you're very fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka turned to the speaker, a runner with dusky skin and reddish brown hair.</p>
<p>&quot;But  I won't lose,&quot; Elsa said with a grin, trying to get into the other  runner's head. She expected some sort of wisecrack remark or comeback.  Instead, Haruka just stared at her hard for a second or two, like she  was trying to bring herself into focus.</p>
<p>&quot;On your marks,&quot; the  voice announced. Haruka, Elsa and the five other runners quickly  squatted down into position, awaiting the start of the race. &quot;Ready!&quot;  Elsa quickly glanced over to Haruka. The girl resembled a lioness ready  to pounce. At the sound of the gun, all seven girls in the race rushed  forward. Haruka took the decisive lead early, running like a demon down  the track. The sound of the wind rustling echoed in her ears even as  she tried to run away from her dreams and visions down the track.</p>
<p>Haruka  crossed the finish line, only dimly aware of the other runners  finishing the race behind her or the cheering of the crowd. She went  back to her gym bag she set below the bleachers near where the students  from her school were sitting. It was still relatively chilly as she put  on a pair of purple sweatpants and a sweatshirt for warmth.</p>
<p>&quot;Tenoh Haruka-san.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka turned to see the dark-skinned runner from earlier coming up to her, the girl smiling in a show of good sportsmanship.</p>
<p>&quot;I had heard rumors about you,&quot; Elsa said as she kept up the pretext of not having raced Haruka before. &quot;You really <strong>are</strong> amazing. I have someone I want to introduce you to. Come on over, Michiru.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka  turned from Elsa and saw a breathtaking vision coming towards her. The  girl's wavy shoulder length aquamarine hair framed her face and slender  swan-like neck perfectly. And what a face it did frame, with deep dark  blue eyes that sparkled as she returned the blonde's gaze, a nose  worthy of a Michaelangelo sculpture, and full rounded lips that were  formed into a shy half-smile. She came closer, clutching a sketchbook  close to her chest.</p>
<p>As she gazed upon the girl, Haruka could've  sworn she heard faint music coming from somewhere in the distance,  along with the faint scent of roses.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Kaioh Michiru-san.  She's really intelligent, and she's said to be a prodigious painter.  She says she's interested in you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You aren't sweating at all,&quot;  Michiru said as she came over to stand next to Elsa and across from  Haruka, &quot;Perhaps you were holding back quite a bit?&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka smirked at that. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru smiled as she leaned forward ever so slightly. &quot;Can't you hear the sound of wind rustling?&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka's  jaw dropped, the scent of flowers and sound of music forgotten in a  flash as a sinking feeling took hold of her. It was <em>her</em>, the girl from her visions, the one who spoke of grails and Messias and past lives and Senshi.</p>
<p>As  they continued to stare at one another, Haruka realized that all this  time it was her, Michiru, whom she'd been running away from these past  few months. She swallowed hard as she quickly worked to regain her  composure.</p>
<p>&quot;You're weird,&quot; she finally said as she bent down and  picked up her gym bag, &quot;So, what do you want with me?&quot; she asked,  turning her back to Michiru as she gazed at her over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Michiru  should've expected the response, especially since she'd fought against  her own destiny for so long. Still, coming from the girl before her,  the rejection hurt nonetheless. &quot;Would you be a model for one of my  drawings?&quot; she asked, looking down at her sketchbook then quickly  bringing her eyes back up to Haruka.</p>
<p>Haruka looked away from Michiru. &quot;I'll pass,&quot; she said dismissively as she started to walk away, &quot;I don't like stuff like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  watched silently as Haruka headed for the locker room, a small sigh  escaping her as the blonde disappeared behind the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan,&quot; Elsa asked as she placed a hand on her classmate's shoulder, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai,&quot; she muttered half-heartedly, &quot;I'll be fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Elsa  shook her head. &quot;Hey, don't let a jerk like that get to you. Come on,  Takaiyo is working one of the concession stands with her sempai Chieko.  Let's go check up on them, and maybe the four of us can do something  together.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru slowly nodded her head. &quot;Hai,&quot; she said as she  followed Elsa. Looking back over her shoulder at the locker room doors  though, she narrowed her eyes determinedly. This wasn't over yet, she  told herself. Not by a long shot.</p>
